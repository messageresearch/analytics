[35:29] would like to greet you in the name of
[35:30] Jesus
[35:33] Christ amen tell your neighbor welcome
[35:36] in the house of the
[35:39] Lord
[35:44] amen so we are going to the Book of
[35:46] Malachi chapter
[35:52] 4 vers we just read that verse uh
[35:58] [Music]
[36:01] this is the last verse we
[36:05] read in our sharing last
[36:10] week and we've not really gone to
[36:12] explain on this verse but uh we'll be
[36:15] able to do that in the coming
[36:21] days Malachi 4:
[36:25] 5
[36:29] behold I will send you Elijah the
[36:31] prophet before the coming of the Great
[36:33] and the Dreadful day of the
[36:41] Lord am you may be
[36:46] seated so I also send greetings to the
[36:48] saints that are joining us on
[36:53] Zoom Lord bless
[36:55] you and those of you here in the
[36:58] fellowship also God bless
[37:01] you so uh we are continuing with our
[37:05] subject we shared on last
[37:09] week the ministry of Elijah in the end
[37:14] time there is a lot of a lot for us to
[37:17] talk about this
[37:19] subject so I'd like you to really follow
[37:22] follow with the much
[37:25] kidness
[37:28] the ministry of
[37:30] Elijah so the scripture we have read
[37:32] here in the Book of
[37:35] Malachi it speaks of the coming of
[37:39] Elijah and this Elijah that is being
[37:41] prophesied
[37:44] about is the one that is coming in the
[37:47] end
[37:49] time because remember Malachi is the
[37:53] last book in the Old
[37:55] Testament
[37:58] and you know many people believe this
[38:01] message but very few can be able to uh
[38:05] even read scriptures talking about the
[38:07] Elijah of our
[38:12] time it is highly likely that when you
[38:14] are asked you would say let me go and
[38:16] ask my
[38:19] [Music]
[38:21] pastor so please uh learn these things
[38:25] learn the verses
[38:27] understand them and then you can be able
[38:30] to give answer when you are
[38:33] asked many times when we talk about
[38:35] William Bram as the Elijah of the end
[38:40] time people think we're just cooking
[38:42] this from
[38:45] somewhere and that it has no Bible
[38:48] basis no Bible
[38:50] foundation and because we do not give
[38:53] Foundation enough to this many times
[38:55] people even fear to mention the name
[38:58] William Bram as the Elijah of the end
[39:06] time don't just accept that it is him
[39:09] without knowing why it is
[39:13] him you should know and that is why I'm
[39:16] taking this subject on the ministry of
[39:18] Elijah in the end
[39:21] time so by the by God's grace I expect
[39:24] us to go into certain things
[39:29] and last last week we were we were able
[39:31] to talk a lot about um uh you know
[39:37] Ahab because remember Elijah came at the
[39:40] time of
[39:43] Ahab but
[39:45] notice here he gives a
[39:49] prophecy and he says I will send Elijah
[39:52] the
[39:53] prophet so by this time we know that
[39:57] Elijah the prophet has already gone to
[40:02] heaven because he never died so he's not
[40:06] talking about the physical man called
[40:08] Elijah
[40:11] here he talking about the spirit of
[40:14] Elijah in the end
[40:17] time because God continues to use the
[40:20] spirit which was upon
[40:25] Elijah when we say the spirit of
[40:29] Elijah we don't mean the spirit of the
[40:32] man
[40:34] Elijah we mean the spirit and power the
[40:38] ministry of
[40:42] Elijah and the ministry of Elijah was
[40:45] functioning by the power of the Holy
[40:50] Spirit it was not of his
[40:53] own he was also relying on the Holy
[40:56] Spirit
[40:57] so really this is the ministry of the
[40:59] Holy
[41:02] Spirit working through
[41:05] Elijah so we see that God used Elijah in
[41:08] a mighty
[41:10] way and we read First Kings chapter
[41:15] 18 and I'd like to go through a little
[41:18] bit of it before we
[41:23] [Music]
[41:25] continue now th send and gather to me
[41:29] all Israel unto Mount camel and the
[41:31] prophets of Bal
[41:33] 450 and the prophets of the Groves 400
[41:36] which eat at Jezebel's table so Ahab
[41:39] sent unto all the children of Israel and
[41:41] gathered the prophets together unto
[41:43] Mount
[41:48] Caramel
[41:55] uh
[42:04] [Music]
[42:17] so now this was the
[42:20] time when um Ahab was the
[42:24] king of course time I took you through
[42:27] the
[42:29] history of Israel up to the time of
[42:38] Ahab
[42:41] King that was on the line of of the king
[42:44] Kingdom of
[42:47] Israel remember at this time the kingdom
[42:50] had divided itself into two great
[42:55] pieces
[42:57] by the prophecy of prophet
[43:01] aijah which came to pass through
[43:05] jeroboam when jeroboam became the pro
[43:08] the first
[43:10] king that would rule
[43:12] Israel not having been from the Lage of
[43:17] David is that amen so now we find that
[43:22] at this time you know uh King
[43:27] Ahab was one of the kings that came on
[43:31] that
[43:32] line he wasn't a son of jeroboam
[43:36] also he was a son um a son of somebody
[43:41] else I think um and and and you know but
[43:46] they were all not following after the
[43:48] laws of
[43:50] God they had back
[43:53] asleep you know on this line
[43:57] many kings came up most of them were war
[44:02] generals you know one dasty one comes up
[44:05] brings up a dynasty and it dies and
[44:07] another comes up and he
[44:12] dies and now it was time for King
[44:16] Ahab but you see God gives everyone an
[44:22] opportunity if they would walk in the
[44:24] ways of God God judges them according to
[44:27] what they
[44:30] do you know God is so gracious that he
[44:33] cannot judge you based on what someone
[44:36] else
[44:37] did he gives you your own
[44:41] opportunity and we find that Ahab also
[44:44] had this
[44:46] opportunity to walk in the ways of
[44:49] God but Ahab did not so what did Ahab do
[44:54] Ahab went and married uh
[44:56] a non
[44:59] Jew if you notice in first King 16 where
[45:02] we read last time
[45:05] also verse 31 it says and it came to
[45:07] pass as if it had been a light thing for
[45:09] him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the
[45:11] son of nebat that he took to wife
[45:13] Jezebel the daughter of E ethal king of
[45:16] the zidonians and went and served Bal
[45:19] and woried
[45:24] him
[45:27] [Music]
[45:39] I believe we all
[45:41] remember the sins of
[45:45] jeroboam what were the sins of
[45:48] jeroboam God told
[45:50] job I'm going to give you a sure house
[45:53] like I gave to David
[45:58] only walk in my
[45:59] ways only follow my
[46:02] Commandments and you will have
[46:03] everything you need and you will rule
[46:06] according to your the desire of your
[46:09] heart but what did job
[46:12] doob went after other
[46:15] gods and when he went after other
[46:18] gods God cast him God also rejected him
[46:23] and now we find here that Bible is
[46:26] saying King
[46:29] Ahab it took it as if it had been a
[46:32] light
[46:34] thing to walk in the sins of
[46:37] jerob he did the same things that
[46:40] jeroboam
[46:42] did he he walked in the
[46:45] sins of
[46:49] job we have seen many people in the
[46:53] Bible who are blessed by God
[46:57] but you know the blessing of God doesn't
[46:59] come to you by
[47:02] surprise if you want the blessing of God
[47:05] in your
[47:06] life walk according to the ways of
[47:09] God if you walk according to the ways of
[47:12] God it is a must you must receive the
[47:15] blessing of
[47:16] God but if you don't walk according to
[47:19] the ways of
[47:20] God you will never receive the blessing
[47:23] of
[47:24] God so now many people sit there and
[47:28] they wait to be surprised by God's
[47:33] blessings
[47:34] surprise I'm going to bless you no it
[47:38] doesn't work that way if you are going
[47:40] to be blessed by
[47:42] God you already know before it
[47:45] happens why because you are walking in
[47:48] the ways of
[47:49] God how many are walking in the ways of
[47:52] God today if you're walking in the ways
[47:54] of God
[47:56] I want to say the blessing of God is
[47:59] sure I don't even have to say God bless
[48:02] you because you already blessed because
[48:05] you're walking in the ways of
[48:07] God but King Ahab he took it
[48:12] light as if it had been a light thing
[48:15] for him to walk in the sins of
[48:18] jeroboam and he expected God's
[48:21] blessings so what did he do he took
[48:26] for
[48:27] wife the daughter ofel the king of
[48:33] thei and after that he went and served
[48:38] B and worshiped him if you marry an
[48:44] unbeliever it is almost sure you will
[48:47] worship other
[48:50] gods that is why Believers must always
[48:53] marry believers
[48:57] because
[48:58] nonbelievers will always bring their
[49:01] gods with
[49:03] them but you want to build your
[49:07] house on a sure
[49:10] Foundation you want to build your house
[49:13] on Jesus
[49:15] Christ you know he gave a parable of a
[49:18] man who built his house on a
[49:20] rock and another one who built his house
[49:23] on
[49:24] sun he said the one who built his house
[49:27] on
[49:28] sun when the rains came down and the
[49:31] floods went up the house went down but
[49:35] the one that build his house on the
[49:38] rock the rains came down the floods went
[49:42] up but the house remained
[49:44] sure because it was placed on a
[49:47] rock Jesus Christ is our Solid
[49:51] Rock Amen when we built on
[49:54] him when we are built on him we can
[49:57] never s we can never be destroyed
[50:01] because we are built on a sure
[50:04] Foundation we amen and this message is
[50:08] built on the
[50:10] Rock The Rock of
[50:13] revelation of Jesus Christ amen we are
[50:16] built on the revelation of Jesus
[50:19] Christ Jesus said I will build my
[50:23] church Upon This Rock and and the Gates
[50:26] of Hell shall not Prevail
[50:28] against so the Church of Jesus
[50:31] today and when I said the Church of
[50:34] Jesus it is a universal
[50:37] church I'm talking about men and women
[50:41] people who are
[50:43] built on the revelation of Jesus
[50:46] Christ the revelation of Christ is the
[50:50] word the opening of the
[50:53] word there are some who don't like
[50:56] it but we love it there are some who
[50:59] don't want to follow it but we love to
[51:02] follow it there are some who take it as
[51:04] if it is a light
[51:06] thing to do the things the word says we
[51:09] should not
[51:11] do but we take the word of God
[51:15] serious everything it say we want to do
[51:18] it because we are built on that
[51:22] Foundation that Foundation which can
[51:24] never sink
[51:28] but when the word of God say he should
[51:31] not M an
[51:33] unbeliever he said it is not
[51:36] important and he went and took himself a
[51:41] nonbeliever and when that happened he
[51:44] was introduced to other
[51:47] gods he was introduced to B
[51:51] worship because he married the daughter
[51:54] of ESB
[51:57] [Music]
[51:59] let me tell you brothers and
[52:02] sisters if you're not yet married never
[52:05] even have a slightest desire or even
[52:08] thought of Marrying an
[52:13] unbeliever if you have that thought or
[52:16] that
[52:17] mind God can never give you one of
[52:21] his until you are
[52:24] delivered
[52:26] you must be
[52:28] purposed that this is who I am this is
[52:31] where I am planted I am planted in the
[52:34] word I am planted on the revelation of
[52:37] the
[52:38] word and I am going nowhere
[52:41] else nowhere else this is where I am
[52:45] staying praise
[52:47] God all
[52:49] right so now then we find
[52:54] out that Ahab takes an
[52:59] unbeliever for
[53:01] wife and
[53:03] jeel begins to
[53:06] control the
[53:09] king you know at this time because the
[53:12] King was
[53:14] backsliding you can also say the country
[53:17] was
[53:19] backsliding Israel had
[53:21] backs the glory of God had Departed
[53:26] you know the king had took a heathen for
[53:30] a
[53:32] wife you know and you know there was
[53:35] confusion in the
[53:37] land but God still loved his
[53:40] people God always loves his people that
[53:44] are called by his name he does not leave
[53:47] them to be
[53:49] destroyed he always has a solution for
[53:52] them and in such a situation
[53:55] when the nation was in that
[53:58] situation God sent an Elijah
[54:02] Ministry anah Ministry
[54:05] came to prove where God
[54:08] was to prove what God
[54:11] desired prove what God
[54:14] wanted when Elijah comes he doesn't come
[54:17] with
[54:19] presumption he doesn't come with guess
[54:22] what when Elijah Ministry comes
[54:27] it is th sayth the
[54:29] Lord it is a sure
[54:32] Ministry a perfect ministry because it
[54:35] is speaking on behalf of
[54:39] God if we don't
[54:42] understand the importance of the
[54:45] ministry of
[54:47] Elijah we will not see the need for
[54:50] anijah in the end
[54:53] time but if if we see why God must send
[54:58] Elijah why God sent Elijah in the
[55:02] beginning we will know why God must send
[55:04] Elijah in our
[55:07] time because Jesus Christ is the same
[55:10] yesterday today and
[55:13] forever are you following me
[55:16] now so we notice here Elijah comes on
[55:20] the
[55:21] scene and Elijah tells uh King Ahab
[55:26] you are
[55:28] wrong the prophets of our time can they
[55:32] tell the president or the prime minister
[55:34] or the king of any country that you are
[55:39] wrong they cannot dare
[55:42] that the prophets of this time they
[55:45] can't do that even their association
[55:48] with the king or the the prime minister
[55:50] or the
[55:53] president a grand opport
[55:57] it is a cake for
[55:59] them they cannot let it
[56:03] go they associate with him for for what
[56:06] they
[56:08] receive and and and and what when he
[56:10] asks them should I do this say yes your
[56:15] Excellency God is with you go the power
[56:19] of God is you God is telling you th say
[56:21] the Lord God
[56:23] is because they money because they want
[56:27] Power because they want a brand new car
[56:30] because that is the other
[56:32] prophets but when it comes to Prophet
[56:36] Elijah Hallelujah when he comes he comes
[56:40] with that sayth the
[56:42] Lord he says it the way it
[56:45] is whether you like it or not whether is
[56:49] sweet or bitter he will tell you that
[56:52] that is what God
[56:53] says
[56:55] that is why people say the message is
[56:59] hard because this message is the message
[57:02] of
[57:03] elah it is not meant to be
[57:07] easy it is not meant to be
[57:10] easy is meant to be
[57:13] hard because it is meant to put the
[57:15] wrong things back to
[57:19] order that is the purpose of the
[57:22] message when we say the message
[57:25] we mean the message of
[57:27] elij Hallelujah God has given us that
[57:30] message
[57:32] again in this end time but before we see
[57:36] it in our time we have to see how it
[57:39] operated in the
[57:42] beginning praise God so Ahab comes and
[57:45] tells
[57:46] Elijah you have done Elijah comes and
[57:50] tells
[57:51] brother you have done
[57:53] wrong you know you you you you have to
[57:58] correct and Jezebel also
[58:01] comes the wife of the king says
[58:06] no this man here elah is
[58:10] misleading I am the true
[58:13] Prophet is the true
[58:15] God and Elijah is
[58:18] misleading so you see at that time when
[58:22] Elijah
[58:23] came there was a woman with so much
[58:26] influence and Power on on the
[58:30] king but there was a prophet with so
[58:33] much power and influence from the Holy
[58:39] Ghost so we are seeing two
[58:41] power walking parall to each
[58:44] other
[58:46] amen whenever you see the minist of
[58:49] el there must be Jezebel
[58:53] somewhere to oppose the minist of
[58:57] Elijah and the minist of Elijah will
[59:00] always defeat the spirit of
[59:04] jeze yes we see here Elijah
[59:10] tells say King go and gather to me bring
[59:14] all the
[59:16] prophets that serve your
[59:19] wife that
[59:22] Ser all of them if their God is
[59:26] God let us see
[59:29] today if my God is God we shall see it
[59:33] before the end of
[59:34] day so they gathered themselves
[59:39] 450
[59:42] prophets oh my God vers one man
[59:47] [Music]
[59:50] Elijah 450 Prophets
[59:55] it is never about
[1:00:02] numbers and You Begin comparing yourself
[1:00:04] with other denominational
[1:00:09] churches I feel
[1:00:11] ashamed sometimes when Believers compare
[1:00:13] themselves with other denomination
[1:00:18] Church how doare you do
[1:00:21] that it's not about
[1:00:23] numbers
[1:00:26] it's never it's never been About
[1:00:30] Numbers
[1:00:32] Never are you hearing me child it has
[1:00:35] always been about the
[1:00:37] truth it has always been about the
[1:00:40] word it has always been about the spirit
[1:00:43] of
[1:00:44] God that is what we want to
[1:00:47] follow where the spirit of God
[1:00:50] is that's where the Eagles
[1:00:53] gather
[1:00:55] because they go there to for Spiritual
[1:00:58] manner 450
[1:01:01] prophets they came and they gathered
[1:01:05] themselves against one
[1:01:08] man Elijah Who challenged them Elijah
[1:01:13] challenged
[1:01:14] them and they came and Elijah told them
[1:01:18] because you are
[1:01:19] many you are going to go
[1:01:23] fast put the
[1:01:27] Altar and um and um and put the
[1:01:31] bulock water and then call on your God
[1:01:36] if he answers by fire then your God is
[1:01:39] the true
[1:01:41] God so they
[1:01:44] started you know they did all the the
[1:01:46] things they had
[1:01:47] to and they started calling on
[1:01:51] [Music]
[1:01:53] their
[1:01:59] they said let us go in the
[1:02:01] spirit maybe they started speaking
[1:02:13] in they be
[1:02:19] excited no
[1:02:22] fire there's something wrong
[1:02:25] bring some
[1:02:26] knives want some
[1:02:30] BL and they brought knives and they said
[1:02:33] that's why I don't believe even our
[1:02:37] prayers should be like the Pentecostal
[1:02:41] prayers the denomination of
[1:02:44] PC the believer a Believer prays with
[1:02:50] Revelation before you pray you even know
[1:02:52] how and what to pray for
[1:02:57] read your Bible go to the Book of Daniel
[1:03:00] and see how Daniel
[1:03:02] Prayed Daniel Prayed Point by Point by
[1:03:05] Point by
[1:03:08] point he knew what to pray for and when
[1:03:11] the angel of the Lord came down Angel
[1:03:14] Gabriel told him exactly what he needed
[1:03:17] to
[1:03:19] know and his prayer was not just out of
[1:03:23] the blue
[1:03:25] it wasn't just excitement it was
[1:03:28] inspired by the revelation of the
[1:03:32] word and so he began praying by
[1:03:35] Revelation by inspiration according to
[1:03:38] the
[1:03:39] word he knew what to say just like Jesus
[1:03:43] he knew what to
[1:03:45] pray like sister she knew what to
[1:03:50] ask
[1:03:52] Revelation but these men they thought it
[1:03:55] is
[1:03:56] shouting they thought it's moving around
[1:03:58] and dancing and cutting themselves that
[1:04:02] moves the Holy
[1:04:04] Ghost no it is
[1:04:07] not one time there was a man called oh
[1:04:12] God remind me his
[1:04:15] name said you know I went to the William
[1:04:19] Bram
[1:04:21] meeting and we thought that the devil
[1:04:23] can't go unless you backed at
[1:04:28] him but that man he told us close your
[1:04:31] eyes now we're going to cast out
[1:04:34] this and he prayed he said Lord kill
[1:04:38] this child and th devil I command you to
[1:04:41] leave in the name of and said open your
[1:04:44] eyes the child has been delivered tell
[1:04:47] who was a preacher
[1:04:49] said how possible is that before he even
[1:04:52] backed at that demon
[1:04:55] how come it has
[1:04:57] gone said we were
[1:05:04] used that's what
[1:05:07] theil but I
[1:05:10] different I saw Jesus in
[1:05:13] that this thing is on YouTube
[1:05:16] go says
[1:05:18] that praise God and these people here
[1:05:22] they were doing the same thing
[1:05:25] they thought that when they dance and
[1:05:27] Shout too
[1:05:28] much then B will hear them but they were
[1:05:32] doing it without
[1:05:38] Revelation where are
[1:05:41] [Music]
[1:05:43] you you know like like like like the
[1:05:45] comedy they play the churches these
[1:05:48] days by the way we are seeing those same
[1:05:50] things today
[1:05:53] today why because Elijah is here again
[1:05:58] today some two Spirits are
[1:06:02] working the spirit of Jezebel is
[1:06:05] here in our generation but the spirit of
[1:06:09] Elijah is here
[1:06:11] again to restore us back again to the
[1:06:15] realities of the Living
[1:06:17] God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:06:20] hallelujah and then as they cut
[1:06:23] themselves
[1:06:29] you know I will tell you
[1:06:33] why never
[1:06:35] answered even if was a living
[1:06:39] God some people have said oh no maybe
[1:06:42] they were worshiping the Living God but
[1:06:43] they didn't know they were calling him
[1:06:49] back even if they were talking even if
[1:06:52] they were to talk to the god of Elijah
[1:06:55] he would not have
[1:06:57] answered why the time was
[1:07:02] wrong number one number two the alar was
[1:07:07] messed
[1:07:09] up so the doctrines were all
[1:07:15] wrong and the time was
[1:07:17] wrong hallelujah hallelujah so God could
[1:07:20] not
[1:07:21] answer and could not even know what to
[1:07:26] do was already
[1:07:28] confused who can stand be who can stand
[1:07:31] before the
[1:07:33] king when is there and telling me that
[1:07:36] is going to work impossible and that's
[1:07:39] what we see on these comedian some of
[1:07:42] them calling themselves
[1:07:44] preachers you know for a sure the holy
[1:07:47] spirit is never for
[1:07:49] a never for a show that's one of the
[1:07:52] ways to know that preacher is a false
[1:07:56] preacher they come and they begin
[1:07:59] prophesying especially in Africa we have
[1:08:01] a lot of
[1:08:02] them and they say and then they begin
[1:08:04] calling their names and beating their
[1:08:08] chests yes I am
[1:08:11] Prophet whatever and then people
[1:08:15] shout and Believers I hope you don't
[1:08:18] have televisions and you are going to
[1:08:19] watch those kind of
[1:08:22] things you you're just wasting your
[1:08:27] time feeding on wrong
[1:08:29] Spirits that's not the god of
[1:08:32] Elijah the god of Elijah is a god of
[1:08:36] order he restores the true teaching
[1:08:40] first when they finished
[1:08:43] everything when they were just there
[1:08:46] they couldn't even
[1:08:47] walk do
[1:08:49] anything you are done
[1:08:51] now now I can start
[1:08:54] what time was it the Bible says it was
[1:08:56] the evening
[1:08:58] time it was time for the evening
[1:09:03] sacrif Hallelujah the Bible says in the
[1:09:06] evening time it shall be
[1:09:10] light oh my that is the time for Elijah
[1:09:14] to come on the
[1:09:17] scene that's the time for him to
[1:09:19] come and I told you evening time is also
[1:09:22] meaning in other ways
[1:09:24] end
[1:09:28] time the end of
[1:09:31] time we are living in those days we are
[1:09:35] in the end
[1:09:40] timeall praise God the Bible says there
[1:09:43] shall be time no
[1:09:46] longer it is going to be
[1:09:49] finished time no longer Time For What
[1:09:52] and time for what listen to me carefully
[1:09:55] it's going to be end of
[1:09:59] time for the sealed
[1:10:05] book Oh Glory to God Hallelujah the
[1:10:09] bride the true
[1:10:11] Israel will no longer read from a closed
[1:10:17] book but she will now read from an open
[1:10:22] book
[1:10:24] Revelation with understanding also
[1:10:28] because she has heard amen from the
[1:10:31] messenger of her
[1:10:34] age the Bible says when Amen in the days
[1:10:37] of the
[1:10:39] voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:10:42] begins to sound the mystery of God shall
[1:10:45] be
[1:10:46] finished not time for Mysteries
[1:10:49] anymore the Mysteries are going to be
[1:10:52] open are going to be revealed the seals
[1:10:56] are going to be open and the bride will
[1:10:59] have full
[1:11:01] access full access to the glory full
[1:11:06] access to the real
[1:11:09] God whereby that same God how do you
[1:11:13] know you have full
[1:11:14] access the Bible says he answers by
[1:11:18] fire that God Answers by fire and if you
[1:11:22] know you have access to him
[1:11:24] you will be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:11:27] and Fire you cannot be called
[1:11:31] anymore you will not be a called
[1:11:33] believer you will be on fire for
[1:11:38] the revelation of the word brings fire
[1:11:44] it doesn't bring
[1:11:46] ice it brings fire and so
[1:11:50] Elijah he this was the evening time
[1:11:54] this was the end
[1:11:56] time amen time oh glory to God
[1:12:00] hallelujah God had to come down at that
[1:12:05] moment because it was the right time it
[1:12:08] was the end
[1:12:10] time of God
[1:12:14] Silence theend of
[1:12:19] Silence tell your neighbor the end time
[1:12:21] of
[1:12:22] God
[1:12:25] the end time of God is
[1:12:27] Sil from morning God was silent
[1:12:30] afternoon God was but in the evening
[1:12:33] time it shall be life the Bible says God
[1:12:39] Amen is light in him is light and there
[1:12:43] is no Darkness at
[1:12:45] all it was the end time of God silence
[1:12:51] and when amen Elijah came on
[1:12:55] he knew it was time for God to
[1:13:00] speak we are living in the time where
[1:13:04] God has
[1:13:05] spoken after all have
[1:13:08] spoken time for God to
[1:13:11] speak it was no longer time for B to
[1:13:16] speak about to it was time for God
[1:13:21] himself to speak through his
[1:13:25] messenger they were
[1:13:28] 450 doing the same thing but there was
[1:13:31] one
[1:13:32] Elijah doing a different thing all
[1:13:37] together oh my God and when he
[1:13:41] came he put the alar in
[1:13:45] order that's the first
[1:13:47] thing you see Al here means the
[1:13:52] doctrines the teachings because each
[1:13:55] Stone was meaning One Tribe of
[1:13:58] Israel so they had to all be in
[1:14:01] order in the right place in the right
[1:14:05] position for God to
[1:14:08] answer so
[1:14:10] Elijah he broke the
[1:14:13] altar he broke everything and he rebu it
[1:14:18] he restored it the the same alar which
[1:14:21] they were using
[1:14:24] he broke it and he rebuilded it you see
[1:14:28] the denominations have had some
[1:14:29] doctrines they have Tau for
[1:14:33] years but when Elijah comes he breaks
[1:14:37] everything he kicks everything he puts
[1:14:40] apart everything he comes and he says
[1:14:43] there is nothing like infant
[1:14:46] baptism there is nothing like women
[1:14:49] preachers there is nothing like baptism
[1:14:51] in in Trinity say from
[1:14:55] Hell who is this
[1:14:58] man he a minister of
[1:15:00] restoration it's a minister of Elijah
[1:15:04] coming to break the Altar and restore it
[1:15:07] in the right
[1:15:09] order in the right way it is supposed to
[1:15:14] be and we see him he came and put the
[1:15:18] alar in
[1:15:19] order and after putting the alar in
[1:15:22] order then he puts the B and
[1:15:26] everything them
[1:15:28] power praise God praise God Power
[1:15:33] Water they powered
[1:15:36] water they powered water the B actually
[1:15:39] says that water went even in the
[1:15:44] trenches
[1:15:46] everywhere they they had powered
[1:15:49] water and when he started
[1:15:52] praying
[1:15:53] praise
[1:15:55] God praise
[1:15:58] God and and
[1:16:01] uh he said do it the second
[1:16:05] time and they did it the second time and
[1:16:08] said do it the
[1:16:09] third and they did the and the water ran
[1:16:13] around about thear and they F the trench
[1:16:17] also with
[1:16:19] water and it came to pass at the time of
[1:16:23] the
[1:16:24] offering of the evening
[1:16:29] sacrifice that Elijah the prophet
[1:16:32] came near and
[1:16:35] say Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of
[1:16:40] Israel let it be known this
[1:16:43] day that you are God in
[1:16:46] Israel he wasn't
[1:16:51] just when you're PR I wonder whether you
[1:16:54] pray with
[1:17:05] ration PR with
[1:17:08] Revelation don't just matter or repeat
[1:17:13] words the Bible speaks of this wait
[1:17:16] until I talk about
[1:17:18] prayer see this man was praying with
[1:17:22] revelation
[1:17:24] and he was
[1:17:26] praying according to the
[1:17:29] word he knew what to say that you will
[1:17:33] touch
[1:17:34] God and that I am thy
[1:17:37] servant and that I have done all these
[1:17:39] things that Thy
[1:17:41] word hear me oh Lord hear me that these
[1:17:47] people may know that thou the Lord
[1:17:52] God and thou has turned their heart back
[1:18:00] again that's the ministry of
[1:18:02] Elijah to turn the
[1:18:07] hearts hallelujah hallelujah let them
[1:18:11] know that you are the Lord God let them
[1:18:15] know I am your
[1:18:18] Ser Hallelujah do you remember Gideon
[1:18:22] the sword of the
[1:18:23] Lord and of Gideon always two things
[1:18:28] there is no way you can believe the god
[1:18:29] of Elijah and
[1:18:35] reject you have to believe elah
[1:18:39] First in order to accept his
[1:18:45] message praise
[1:18:47] God we have had many people who say oh
[1:18:49] William Bram was a
[1:18:51] prophet
[1:18:53] he was used by God
[1:18:55] powerfully but he went astray do they
[1:18:58] understand the
[1:19:00] Bible if a prophet is a prophet of
[1:19:03] God he he he cannot go astray in his
[1:19:08] doct because he's a prophet not because
[1:19:10] he did
[1:19:12] Miracles he's a prophet because the word
[1:19:14] of God came to
[1:19:17] him if you read your Bible the Bible
[1:19:21] says and the word of the Lord
[1:19:24] came to
[1:19:26] Isaiah to Daniel so prophets are the
[1:19:31] ones that the word of God come
[1:19:34] to all right so then Miracles are only
[1:19:38] to
[1:19:40] vindicate that what they said was of
[1:19:43] God but these people they accept the
[1:19:46] Miracles and they reject the word but
[1:19:50] the bride believes the word
[1:19:54] that one makes us
[1:19:56] different we are
[1:19:58] interested in everything Elijah has to
[1:20:01] say because Elijah's message is a
[1:20:05] message to restore our hearts back
[1:20:10] again
[1:20:11] hallelujah
[1:20:14] hallelujah wow and so then the fire of
[1:20:19] the
[1:20:21] Lord fell
[1:20:25] read read it again verse
[1:20:28] 38 then the fire of the
[1:20:33] Lord and consumed the bur
[1:20:37] sacrifice and the
[1:20:39] wood and the stones and the dust and
[1:20:44] licked up the
[1:20:46] water that was in the
[1:20:48] trench and when all the people saw
[1:20:51] it F on their
[1:20:53] FA they say the Lord he is the god the
[1:21:00] Lord he is the god meaning there is no
[1:21:04] other God but the god of
[1:21:08] Elijah hallelujah hallelujah the god of
[1:21:11] Elijah is still alive
[1:21:14] today the god of Elijah still Answers by
[1:21:17] fire today the god of Elijah is the only
[1:21:21] God
[1:21:25] and the people that have accepted the
[1:21:28] ministry of Elijah in the
[1:21:31] end they have accepted the true
[1:21:39] God praise God Elijah never came to
[1:21:42] start a
[1:21:44] denomination Elijah never came to start
[1:21:46] a
[1:21:48] following elah never came to start a
[1:21:51] church never started a
[1:21:54] denomination did you know
[1:21:57] that when El came the first time he
[1:21:59] never did
[1:22:01] that when El came the second time
[1:22:03] through elishah he never
[1:22:04] did when he came the third time through
[1:22:07] John the Baptist he never
[1:22:08] did when he comes the fourth time
[1:22:10] through William he never did
[1:22:13] that Elijah never starts a
[1:22:16] following Willam said I never preached
[1:22:20] the
[1:22:21] message said don't bring my
[1:22:23] message to bring up a following after me
[1:22:27] or to start some
[1:22:29] organization I bring it for one purpose
[1:22:32] so that you would have a personal
[1:22:33] relationship Hallelujah with Jesus
[1:22:41] Christ the message is not a
[1:22:44] denomination this is not another
[1:22:47] religion that's why we receive everybody
[1:22:50] and
[1:22:51] anybody
[1:22:53] we accept everyone to
[1:22:55] come invite them no matter how they look
[1:22:59] let them come to your church why because
[1:23:03] this message is for the whole
[1:23:06] world this message is for everyone that
[1:23:09] has
[1:23:12] breath for them to be restored back
[1:23:15] again praise God and so elah that's the
[1:23:19] nature of his
[1:23:21] ministry and came at a
[1:23:23] time when was under
[1:23:27] Jezebel Jezebel had taken grip
[1:23:35] on now today we are seeing the same same
[1:23:40] Spirit
[1:23:43] of ruling the church
[1:23:46] today you read Revelation
[1:23:51] 220 not with understanding I have a few
[1:23:53] things against
[1:23:54] thee because thou sufferest that woman
[1:23:57] Jezebel which call herself a prophetess
[1:24:00] to teach and to seduce my servants to
[1:24:02] commit fornication and to eat things
[1:24:04] sacrificed unto
[1:24:20] Idols praise God so you see this woman
[1:24:25] Jezebel this woman
[1:24:27] Jezebel she always misleads the Servants
[1:24:31] of
[1:24:33] God she calls herself a
[1:24:36] prophetes she calls herself a
[1:24:39] teacher by seducing
[1:24:42] preachers and Believers to commit
[1:24:46] spiritual
[1:24:48] fornication what is spiritual
[1:24:51] fornication taking this
[1:24:54] Bible and they mix it up with traditions
[1:24:57] and ideas of
[1:25:02] man that is the spirit of
[1:25:05] Jezebel the spirit of Jezebel we have
[1:25:09] seen it in our generation it has come in
[1:25:11] a powerful
[1:25:13] way to even make the women physically be
[1:25:16] look and behave like
[1:25:20] her no wonder women in our generation
[1:25:23] especially those who are in
[1:25:28] church paint
[1:25:32] themselves what is that Jezebel was a
[1:25:39] heathen she was not believing in the god
[1:25:42] of
[1:25:43] Israel she was a
[1:25:45] Heen and because of that she she
[1:25:49] according to their Heathen traditions
[1:25:53] [Music]
[1:25:55] they painted
[1:25:57] themselves to look appealing to their
[1:26:02] people especially the
[1:26:04] men now we see that same
[1:26:08] thing in our own African
[1:26:14] traditions and also other
[1:26:17] countries sometimes people think that
[1:26:19] this is oh only our
[1:26:21] Africa
[1:26:23] even in
[1:26:24] Europe even in in in in
[1:26:27] India Asia all
[1:26:30] over according to the human
[1:26:34] Traditions the Heen
[1:26:37] Traditions they have always painted
[1:26:43] themselves it is not
[1:26:47] because of
[1:26:51] civilization even before
[1:26:54] civilization then people used to paint
[1:26:59] themselves different
[1:27:01] colors different this and
[1:27:04] that their
[1:27:06] lips they put holds on
[1:27:08] their they put Cs on their body in their
[1:27:12] ears and in their nose and on their
[1:27:14] tongue and everywhere I mean this is
[1:27:16] like
[1:27:17] ancient the Egyptians used to do it and
[1:27:21] all the other ancient
[1:27:24] civilizations it's not a new
[1:27:26] thing but see here in the
[1:27:30] Bible this was uh these were the
[1:27:34] zidonians
[1:27:35] they used to do this thing you know to
[1:27:38] to paint themselves and they called
[1:27:42] makeup so they used to makeup themselves
[1:27:45] and they thought it is a good
[1:27:47] thing but Jesus Christ one time was born
[1:27:52] and when he was born he brought another
[1:27:55] civilization to the
[1:27:59] world and this
[1:28:01] civilization Hallelujah is what we have
[1:28:05] received this Bible is not a white man's
[1:28:10] book the white men have rejected it
[1:28:14] even it is not a black man's
[1:28:17] book the black man have heard it for
[1:28:19] many years they didn't understand it
[1:28:22] it is not a Red Man's book or a yellow
[1:28:24] man's
[1:28:25] book this is the word of
[1:28:29] God hallelujah and it guides us into all
[1:28:35] righteousness and we see that in there
[1:28:39] we read about
[1:28:41] Jezebel a woman that was painting
[1:28:44] herself to attract
[1:28:47] men and we see the women doing the same
[1:28:50] thing today
[1:28:53] they paint their
[1:28:55] fces they put they pain their
[1:28:58] lips they pain
[1:29:01] their they PA all these
[1:29:03] things to look artificially
[1:29:07] [Music]
[1:29:09] beautiful in order to SC at
[1:29:13] God that they are not wonderfully
[1:29:17] men but when you hear the message of
[1:29:20] Elijah
[1:29:22] sister you are able to
[1:29:24] understand you are fearfully and
[1:29:26] wonderfully
[1:29:29] may need artificial
[1:29:32] Beauty you are beautiful
[1:29:35] naturally whatever you use on your
[1:29:39] skin
[1:29:41] matters it must just manifest
[1:29:48] Christ whatever doesn't change you it's
[1:29:51] all right
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:29:54] whatever doesn't change
[1:29:58] you praise
[1:30:02] God cuz I had somebody oh you mean we
[1:30:05] can't even use lotion we can't even
[1:30:13] use we're talking about the spirit of
[1:30:18] Jezebel that changes
[1:30:20] themselves
[1:30:22] to attract
[1:30:24] men it's a spirit of
[1:30:28] fornication and
[1:30:30] uh I say my time is almost
[1:30:33] up I have about 10 minutes here but let
[1:30:36] me read you a little portion
[1:30:38] here I'll carry on the next
[1:30:41] time he says the first and the very
[1:30:43] important
[1:30:46] thing that we learn about
[1:30:48] Jezebel is that she is not a daughter of
[1:30:54] Abraham nor is her induction into the
[1:30:57] tribes of Israel one of the spiritual
[1:31:00] one of spiritual admission as as was
[1:31:02] that of
[1:31:04] [Music]
[1:31:08] Ruth the one that inded that her
[1:31:15] in the
[1:31:17] moabit sir this woman was the daughter
[1:31:20] ofba
[1:31:22] the king of sidon who was the priest of
[1:31:26] the he had gained the throne by muring
[1:31:30] his
[1:31:34] predecessor pH so we see right
[1:31:38] away that she was the daughter of a
[1:31:42] murderer this certainly reminds us of
[1:31:45] Cain and the way she became a part of
[1:31:48] Israel was not through the spiritual
[1:31:49] channels that God had ordained for GLE
[1:31:54] [Music]
[1:31:59] admission but she came in by
[1:32:03] marriage
[1:32:05] toab the king of the 10 tribes of
[1:32:09] Israel now this
[1:32:11] Union as we have seen was not
[1:32:16] spiritual so there are many people who
[1:32:18] want to bring and make Believers by Mar
[1:32:22] [Music]
[1:32:27] that's not a
[1:32:29] spiritual it was
[1:32:32] political and so this woman who was
[1:32:35] stepped in
[1:32:38] idolatry did not have the least desire
[1:32:41] to become a worshiper of the one true
[1:32:48] God but rather she came with V
[1:32:52] intentions of turning Israel away from
[1:32:54] the
[1:32:58] Lord if
[1:33:06] youel know
[1:33:08] nonbeliever will come with an avowed
[1:33:14] intention turning you to worship
[1:33:19] the but remember you are Sons and
[1:33:22] Daughters of
[1:33:24] ab according to the
[1:33:28] convenant now Israel the 10 tribes had
[1:33:31] already known what it was to worship the
[1:33:32] golden
[1:33:38] CES but as yet they were not sold out to
[1:33:44] idolatry God was woried and the law of
[1:33:47] Moses was
[1:33:50] acknowledged but from the time of ab's
[1:33:53] marriage to
[1:33:55] Jezebel I her to progressed in a deadly
[1:34:01] fashion if you want to
[1:34:04] progress in your
[1:34:07] backsliding
[1:34:10] unbel it will be a deadly
[1:34:15] progression it was when this woman
[1:34:18] became a
[1:34:20] priestess
[1:34:22] in the temples that she erected to aat
[1:34:25] or which is Venus and B the Son of God
[1:34:27] that Israel came to the crisis of her
[1:34:35] [Music]
[1:34:41] life with this in
[1:34:44] mind we can now begin to see what the
[1:34:46] spirit of God is setting forth in this
[1:34:48] thean church
[1:34:50] age
[1:34:53] here it is I have married Jezebel and he
[1:34:57] did it as a political maneuver to
[1:34:58] strengthen his kingdom and
[1:35:04] security that is exactly what the church
[1:35:06] did when it married under
[1:35:11] Constantin they both go
[1:35:14] together for political
[1:35:17] reasons though they put a spiritual air
[1:35:20] to it
[1:35:22] now no one can convince me that
[1:35:24] Constantin was a
[1:35:26] Christian he was a pagan with what
[1:35:30] looked like a Christian
[1:35:34] trapping he painted white crosses on the
[1:35:36] soldier
[1:35:41] Shield he was the originator of the
[1:35:43] Knights of
[1:35:46] Columbus he put a cross on the stipple
[1:35:49] of St Sophia's there by starting a
[1:35:54] [Music]
[1:35:57] tradition you see the Catholic Church
[1:35:59] doing
[1:36:00] it Church doing it they putting that
[1:36:04] cross on the step of their
[1:36:07] churches that tradition was begun by
[1:36:10] Emperor
[1:36:13] Constantine Emperor
[1:36:15] constan was not a
[1:36:17] Christian he oh he only married the
[1:36:20] church
[1:36:22] and politics for his own
[1:36:27] agenda and and the church remained
[1:36:31] blinded they they didn't understand what
[1:36:33] Constantin was up
[1:36:36] to Constantin actually with because of
[1:36:39] him even infant baptism
[1:36:44] started it was the year 325
[1:36:49] ad in the third century
[1:36:53] when when they called all the believer
[1:36:56] the
[1:36:58] bishops come together in one
[1:37:00] place and out of that they began their
[1:37:04] own doctrines and
[1:37:06] traditions the church married with a
[1:37:11] state the Bible talks about it in the
[1:37:14] book The Church age of
[1:37:17] pamos and he says that's where Satan's
[1:37:20] Throne is
[1:37:25] when they had their one first
[1:37:30] leader of both the church and politics
[1:37:32] at the same
