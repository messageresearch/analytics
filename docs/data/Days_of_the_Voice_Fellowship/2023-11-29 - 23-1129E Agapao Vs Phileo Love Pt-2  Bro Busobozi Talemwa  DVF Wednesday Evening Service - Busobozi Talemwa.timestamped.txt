[31:31] of First
[31:36] Corinthians usually when we stream on
[31:38] the zoom we don't go more than one
[31:44] hour so I just trust that uh today we'll
[31:49] be able to conclude this
[31:53] thought on agap and vers
[32:03] so we read 1 Corinthians chapter
[32:08] 13 we'll just go back to
[32:12] that
[32:15] amen so I'll read in English because of
[32:19] time from verse one though I speak with
[32:22] the tongues of men and of angels and I
[32:25] have not charity I am become a sounding
[32:27] brass or a tinkling symbol and though I
[32:30] have the gifts of Prophecy and
[32:33] understand all Mysteries and all
[32:34] knowledge and and though I have all
[32:37] Faith so that I I could remove mountains
[32:39] and have not love love is Charity I am
[32:42] nothing and though I bestow all my goods
[32:45] to feed the poor and though I give my
[32:47] body to be burned and have not charity
[32:51] it profits me nothing love suffereth
[32:55] long and is kind love envieth not love
[32:58] vth not itself and is not P does not
[33:02] behave itself unsing unseemly seeketh
[33:05] not our own is not easily provoked
[33:08] thinketh no evil rejoices not in
[33:10] iniquity but rejoices in the truth
[33:13] beareth all things believeth all things
[33:15] hopeth all things and doth all things
[33:18] Love Never Fails but whether there be
[33:20] prophecies they shall fail where there
[33:22] be tongues they shall seize whether
[33:25] there be knowledge it shall vanish away
[33:28] i' would like the brother to read from
[33:30] Verses 4 to vers
[33:47] [Music]
[33:55] 8
[34:16] praise God Amen you may be
[34:22] seated let's
[34:24] pray father Lord we ask that you'll come
[34:27] come and make yourself known to
[34:31] US Open this word to us Lord anoint
[34:35] us we are nothing without you
[34:38] lord we just need you to come overwhelm
[34:43] Us by the Revelation and inspiration of
[34:45] your
[34:47] word which will be a blessing to your
[34:49] people
[34:50] today different needs
[34:53] Lord in the
[34:55] fellowship the believer that are
[34:57] streaming on
[34:58] Zoom others that will hear
[35:01] this may you meet each need I
[35:03] pray I just take myself out of the way
[35:06] now said you will use me Lord as you
[35:10] will in Jesus
[35:12] name amen so this evening Saints we want
[35:15] to talk about AAP
[35:20] love now I understand that the word of
[35:23] the the word love is used many times
[35:28] and uh we really use it a
[35:31] lot but often times the word love has
[35:33] been
[35:37] misunderstood and he been only placed on
[35:42] feelings and imagine if you see
[35:45] something you say oh I love
[35:48] it what about if you could not
[35:52] see would you love it
[35:55] still well you say yeah I would love it
[35:57] because I would touch
[35:59] it so then then what about if you could
[36:02] not touch or you don't have the sense of
[36:06] feeling then how would you love
[36:09] it I would smell
[36:11] it smells nice I love it what about if
[36:15] you could not
[36:17] smell how well would you love it well
[36:20] you would say I hear the voice oh I love
[36:23] that
[36:24] sound how about if you could not hear
[36:28] so then you realize that love true
[36:31] love is not bound to the five
[36:36] senses true love is well over and Beyond
[36:40] the five
[36:43] senses and many
[36:45] times people when they talk about love
[36:48] they talk about it in connection to the
[36:50] five
[36:52] [Music]
[36:54] senses you know and that's where usually
[36:56] the problem comes
[36:58] from then we we devalue
[37:03] love and not able to truly understand
[37:06] the true meaning of
[37:09] love and yet we need love to be a part
[37:12] of our
[37:15] Lives to be able to be really really
[37:19] genuine without love we cannot be
[37:23] genuine in marriage you need
[37:25] love family you need love in the
[37:29] community you need
[37:30] love in the school in associations of
[37:33] your
[37:34] life we need love but as we saw in the
[37:37] first service and I'm not going to
[37:39] repeat it if you missed it please go and
[37:40] and and listen to
[37:45] it we were able to talk extensively
[37:48] about F
[37:51] love and we found that many of these
[37:53] things that is really F love many people
[37:56] think it is the real
[38:03] love but yet here we see in the book of
[38:06] 1 Corinthians chapter
[38:09] 13 he explains and expounds what love
[38:15] is he explains it really in in terms and
[38:18] in in the language that we can be able
[38:20] to
[38:23] understand for instance it says love
[38:26] suffereth
[38:29] long love is
[38:31] kind love enth
[38:34] not love V not
[38:37] itself love is not pu
[38:39] up it does not behave itself
[38:43] UNS seeketh not her
[38:45] own is not easily
[38:48] provoked thinketh no
[38:51] evil rejoices not in
[38:53] iniquity but re rejoices in the truth
[38:57] truth oh my that is a a very big thing
[39:01] right
[39:02] there love rejoices in the
[39:06] truth what is truth he says Thy word is
[39:11] truth his word is truth love beareth all
[39:16] things believeth all things hopes all
[39:20] things endureth all
[39:23] things love is really over and Beyond
[39:25] many many
[39:29] and then he says Love Never
[39:33] Fails tell your neighbor Love Never
[39:37] Fails many things will fail he says if
[39:41] there are big
[39:43] gifts gifts like for instance
[39:46] prophecies they shall fail Tong shall
[39:50] fail you know uh knowledge shall
[39:53] fail all these things shall vanish away
[39:57] but love cannot
[39:59] fail what is it that cannot
[40:02] fail so in other words here is's trying
[40:04] to say that love has no expired
[40:11] debt love does not
[40:14] expire and yet let me ask you a question
[40:18] what is the main
[40:20] thing in a marriage
[40:24] relationship is it not love
[40:27] amen love is the main
[40:30] thing but here it says love does not
[40:35] expire why then do we see
[40:39] divorce why do we see two people loving
[40:41] each
[40:42] other so crazy about each
[40:45] other and then after a while they want
[40:47] to
[40:49] separate and then friends two great
[40:51] friends after a while they want to
[40:54] separate because what they had was
[40:56] another form of
[40:59] love it was not the real genuine
[41:03] love and we found that that the two
[41:06] different kinds of
[41:08] Love human love and which is fow
[41:13] love and love which is the Divine
[41:18] love that's a higher
[41:21] love a bigger higher
[41:25] level and so we found that pH love will
[41:29] fail many
[41:32] times and you know we read a scripture
[41:35] in the book of
[41:37] Isaiah where he where the Lord asks
[41:40] whether a woman can forget a hering
[41:46] child or whether she can forget her
[41:49] child from her
[41:52] womb and that he would not have
[41:54] compassion over that child
[41:58] and then you know you may almost say no
[42:00] it is not
[42:02] possible mothers truly love their
[42:06] children but also many times mothers
[42:09] have forgotten and forsaken their
[42:12] [Music]
[42:14] children now the love of a
[42:16] mother to the child is human
[42:21] love but that love too
[42:24] fails and and the love a woman usually
[42:28] has with with a
[42:31] husband and ver Versa is fellow
[42:36] love and that to
[42:39] fails the love between people who like
[42:42] each
[42:44] other and make confidence with one
[42:47] another even between countries between
[42:50] nations between people you know this all
[42:55] fail
[42:56] they have an expired
[42:58] de it is best under
[43:02] circumstances we found out also that the
[43:05] love that Jesus had rather Peter had for
[43:09] Jesus it seemed to be a real huge big
[43:15] love but that to
[43:17] failed it reached a place where it
[43:20] expired Peter even spoke to Jesus and
[43:24] said when all others forsake
[43:27] you I will never forsake you I will be
[43:30] by your side I will follow you until
[43:35] death but before death could
[43:38] come Peter had already forsaken Jesus
[43:42] and then you would still really know
[43:44] that Peter had
[43:46] love and Peter was genuinely in love
[43:49] with
[43:50] Jesus but he was genuinely in love
[43:55] humanly
[43:57] and that two
[43:59] fails and I also showed you that the
[44:01] Bible says that cast be a man that
[44:03] trusts in
[44:06] another and that our trust shall be in
[44:09] the
[44:11] Lord the problem of it is we trust in
[44:16] people and many times we say why did you
[44:19] disappoint me when I trusted
[44:23] you if you trusted man let me assure you
[44:26] that man will forsake
[44:28] [Music]
[44:31] you at one point that man will fail
[44:35] you because his love for you and vice
[44:38] versa has an expired
[44:43] day but there is a love that has no
[44:48] expiring that is divine
[44:51] love per
[44:54] love love
[44:56] that's the love of
[44:58] God the love of God can never
[45:02] expire the love of God made God put on
[45:06] flesh that he came down here on
[45:08] Earth To Die For Us who were
[45:13] nothing who gave him nothing who did
[45:17] nothing to attract his
[45:20] life everything we did pushed him
[45:24] away because he loved us he was willing
[45:28] to lay down his
[45:31] life so that we may attain
[45:34] life we who were dead in
[45:37] sins in our
[45:40] trespasses he loved us before he we knew
[45:45] him what a wonderful
[45:49] love we sing about such love such
[45:51] wondrous
[45:53] love that God should love a sin such
[45:57] as how wonderful a love like this so let
[46:01] me announce to you this evening God does
[46:04] not love
[46:05] you because you have done something to
[46:07] attract his
[46:10] love God loves you because he loves
[46:14] you and God knew you before you knew him
[46:19] God chose you in before the foundation
[46:23] of the world and you are manifested here
[46:26] and you believed him because you were
[46:29] attracted to his
[46:32] love not because you loved him so much
[46:36] that he decided to love you no you
[46:38] didn't even love him you were even
[46:41] running away like Adam and Eve were
[46:44] running
[46:45] away but because God loved them he came
[46:49] down and said Adam where are
[46:51] you in other words I'm
[46:53] here love see I am not going to let you
[46:58] die I am not going to let you fall away
[47:02] because I love you so much you are bound
[47:05] in my arms that's why he said all the
[47:08] father has given me will
[47:10] come they all inscribed in the palm of
[47:12] my
[47:13] hands none of them will be
[47:16] lost and I'm here because of his love
[47:19] you are here because of his love not
[47:22] because of your
[47:23] actions and you leave the bad
[47:27] actions because of his
[47:30] love praise the name of the Lord and so
[47:34] he found
[47:35] out that then love
[47:40] regresses
[47:45] regresses they find out that the perfect
[47:47] love is divine love which is the love of
[47:51] God and then from
[47:53] there we find another level which is
[47:58] called and we read that from the message
[48:00] he must be born
[48:02] again and then from
[48:05] there we find let me just read that
[48:08] portion for you because that's what we
[48:10] ended
[48:11] with after that
[48:15] comes
[48:18] from the love that you you have for your
[48:22] wife someone would insult her
[48:26] you will shoot his brains out because it
[48:29] creates a
[48:31] jealousy but that
[48:33] is that is secondary
[48:36] love then comes
[48:38] last for another man's
[48:42] wife you see now from
[48:45] a it regresses
[48:48] to regresses now to
[48:51] last you find someone saying I love you
[48:54] but to someone else's
[48:56] [Music]
[48:59] wife is that truly
[49:01] love that's not even pH
[49:04] love that is
[49:06] last praise God you're saying love I
[49:09] love you to a woman that you're never
[49:11] going to
[49:12] [Music]
[49:13] marry that is
[49:15] last and then after last then comes
[49:21] fil right then it just becomes perverted
[49:25] after
[49:25] [Music]
[49:32] that F
[49:35] perversion that's how the devil brings
[49:39] down and you know regresses
[49:45] love and then he says pH love would make
[49:48] you shoot a man for insulting your
[49:50] [Music]
[49:54] wife
[49:56] would make you pray for his L
[50:00] soul that is the
[50:02] difference so you must be born
[50:04] again now listen now when the Bible says
[50:08] husbands love your
[50:11] wives is that amen husbands love your
[50:16] wives what kind of love is he talking
[50:20] about husbands love your
[50:24] wife talking about
[50:26] last answer
[50:28] me is it talking about
[50:31] filth is it talking about
[50:34] perion is talking about
[50:39] love he is talking about
[50:45] what many times you want to say well
[50:47] well says a woman a man has for his wife
[50:54] love
[50:57] so then that means that between a
[51:00] marriage should be on the basis
[51:04] of if you understand it that
[51:07] way then you've not understood
[51:11] anything that is only the
[51:14] beginning love will make you attract get
[51:16] attracted to
[51:17] [Music]
[51:19] her but love will take you in another
[51:24] real which is a supernatural
[51:27] real whereby you do not see how she
[51:30] looks what she has what she has done
[51:31] what she has not
[51:33] done whereby you will go into another
[51:36] realm where it is
[51:38] Supernatural naturally
[51:42] Supernatural let's continue with the
[51:44] verse husbands love your
[51:46] wives even as Christ love the child
[51:51] Hallelujah when Christ love the child he
[51:54] did not love us with
[51:56] he us
[52:00] with and then he continues on even as
[52:03] Christ loved the church and he gave
[52:05] himself for it he was willing to die he
[52:10] was willing to sacrifice him he was Will
[52:12] to do everything and
[52:14] anything for the
[52:16] sake of the
[52:18] lover that he had now you might say well
[52:23] yeah a man can love a woman with that he
[52:26] will do anything and
[52:29] everything but you know what the
[52:31] moment that man finds that woman
[52:36] cheating he will not even think
[52:39] twice he will say enough is
[52:41] enough enough is enough we are going to
[52:44] have this no more why because the only
[52:47] connection that they
[52:50] have but if their connection
[52:54] is
[52:56] it never
[52:59] fails never
[53:01] fails when Jesus came down he found us
[53:06] flatting with
[53:08] sin he found us living
[53:11] Immortal he didn't say enough is enough
[53:14] but he said I love you
[53:16] still I want to save you I want to
[53:19] redeem you even now he's speaking to you
[53:23] no matter what kind of life you think
[53:25] you are no matter how bad you think you
[53:29] are he still says I love
[53:32] you I love you I still love you I love
[53:37] you I will love you I continue to love
[53:40] you because I love you I want to save
[53:44] you and that's why I died for you on the
[53:48] cross
[53:50] condition no condition absolutely no
[53:53] condition that God should seen
[53:57] such praise the name of the
[53:59] Lord and then we continue on
[54:03] with a few more moments I want us to now
[54:06] look
[54:10] at now 1 John
[54:14] 4:7 behold let us love one
[54:18] another for the for love is of
[54:22] God and everyone that loveth
[54:26] is born of
[54:27] God is that
[54:29] amen and know with
[54:32] God let us read it again let us love one
[54:36] another for love is of God and everyone
[54:39] that that
[54:41] love is born of God and let me ask you a
[54:45] question we've seen many people say I
[54:47] love
[54:48] you and they in
[54:51] prostitution they in filth they're in l
[54:55] can we really say that they are born of
[54:57] God also because they said I love
[55:00] you and they feel love
[55:03] feelings that's not the kind of love
[55:05] he's talking
[55:06] about he's talking about another kind of
[55:08] Love's
[55:12] talking every
[55:17] that Bor of
[55:20] God he's born
[55:22] again he's filled with the Holy Ghost
[55:26] Hallelujah if you
[55:28] have it means you filled with the Holy
[55:34] Ghost he that
[55:36] loveth
[55:38] not knoweth not
[55:41] God for God is
[55:44] love tell your neighbor God is
[55:47] love God is love God is love and this is
[55:52] a
[55:52] seal that message Believers have
[55:56] loving one
[55:58] another loving one
[56:00] another hallelujah hallelujah you must
[56:02] love one another when you find someone
[56:05] with
[56:06] bitterness fting
[56:09] themselves
[56:11] proud you know you know wanting seeking
[56:13] for something you know for
[56:16] themselves you know when you it means
[56:19] that person has no Holy
[56:22] Spirit it means that person has no love
[56:26] you know when they do something to
[56:28] them they walk away from the church when
[56:32] something happens they will call you all
[56:34] sorts of names and then at first you
[56:37] thought they were
[56:39] Believers but now they remove their true
[56:42] colors let me tell you if you're a True
[56:45] Believer filled with the Holy Ghost you
[56:48] will have love to an extent if you are
[56:53] wrong you still have love for the people
[56:57] that have wronged you you will still
[57:00] pray for them you will still love them
[57:03] and you still want them to go to
[57:06] heaven but then you will find Believers
[57:09] when someone does something to them they
[57:12] will immediately send those people to
[57:14] hell that one will never go interrupt
[57:17] that one is not a believer that one is
[57:19] not
[57:21] whatever it shows that you are filled
[57:23] with bitterness
[57:26] and the love of God is not even in
[57:29] you it means you are also not going to
[57:33] heaven that if you have the love of God
[57:37] no matter what anyone
[57:39] does no matter what anyone says against
[57:42] you you will still love
[57:44] them you will still call them brother
[57:48] you will still call them sister and they
[57:50] would think you are a
[57:52] fool but you can't help it
[57:55] because you have the love of God in your
[57:57] soul you know no
[58:00] bitterness Hallelujah you don't know
[58:04] Revenge to a Son of God who is filled
[58:06] with the Holy
[58:07] Ghost we don't know any
[58:09] Revenge we know his
[58:12] love help me shout
[58:14] love all we know his love we should love
[58:18] one
[58:18] another I don't love that brother they
[58:22] did this and this to me I will never
[58:26] you don't have the Holy
[58:27] Spirit if you have the Holy Spirit you
[58:31] will forget what somebody did to you
[58:33] immediately as soon as they do
[58:38] it forgetting means
[58:41] forgiving in your in your mind you know
[58:44] they did
[58:45] it but you don't hold them
[58:49] against you forgive them and you love
[58:52] them
[58:53] any if you f it is
[58:56] impossible it means you don't have the
[58:57] holy spirit yet and you should ask God
[59:00] to fill you with the Holy Spirit when it
[59:02] fills you with the Holy Ghost you will
[59:05] soon realize it is
[59:10] possible in the message that the works
[59:13] that I do bear witness of
[59:17] me when God wants sign signs His Name
[59:20] Across something like
[59:23] that signs your name or the name of
[59:27] Christ and on a notary takes the seal
[59:30] and puts on
[59:33] [Music]
[59:35] there he the
[59:40] name and the seal that puts on
[59:43] there presses that thing
[59:46] down rather it is there to
[59:49] stay what I mean you know what I'm
[59:53] speaking of
[59:55] now listen usually when you write they
[59:57] write a
[59:59] letter and then it is
[1:00:02] signed then you can take it to the
[1:00:04] notary
[1:00:08] public they call them not
[1:00:11] public those people they are legal they
[1:00:14] the legal representative of the
[1:00:17] government prove that this letter and
[1:00:20] the the person who has signed is all
[1:00:23] authentic
[1:00:26] so they
[1:00:28] it with a seal and they put a seal from
[1:00:33] the not
[1:00:35] Republic now he's saying when Jesus
[1:00:38] Christ signs on a
[1:00:41] letter A SE is
[1:00:45] put that thing is there to
[1:00:49] stay now your life when it is signed by
[1:00:53] Jesus
[1:00:55] when he accepted by
[1:00:57] Jesus what does he do he puts a
[1:01:00] seal heises
[1:01:03] you that you are
[1:01:06] authentic Hallelujah Hallelujah by
[1:01:09] filling you with the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:13] Ghost and he says now I'm preaching it
[1:01:16] I'm not preaching iternal
[1:01:19] [Music]
[1:01:20] security that's not what I'm talking
[1:01:22] about I am it's just more easy thing to
[1:01:25] rub away from the Holy Ghost when God
[1:01:27] once seals that love into your
[1:01:31] [Music]
[1:01:37] heart when God seals that
[1:01:41] love your heart did you hear what I just
[1:01:45] read to you what does it seal you
[1:01:49] with fills you with

[1:01:58] heart is a b of
[1:02:02] perfection once you receive that seal of
[1:02:04] the Holy
[1:02:06] Ghost it is not easy to rra that thing
[1:02:11] away once it happens to you you are
[1:02:15] sealed until the day of the
[1:02:19] Rapture you can never go to
[1:02:22] hell you can never be this

[1:04:07] questions and answers
[1:04:11] 1964 there's a question here that was
[1:04:14] asked to brother
[1:04:16] Bram dear brother
[1:04:18] Bram do you believe that signs should
[1:04:20] follow all who have the Holy
[1:04:23] Spirit
[1:04:26] you know some people say well we don't
[1:04:28] need
[1:04:28] science we only need the
[1:04:31] word but listen to what our Prophet
[1:04:34] say Jesus said
[1:04:37] so Mark
[1:04:40] 16 hallelujah hallelujah he said if so
[1:04:44] the question goes what about the people
[1:04:47] who believe the message with all that is
[1:04:49] in
[1:04:53] them
[1:04:55] yet they have not the
[1:04:58] signs are they
[1:05:01] unbelievers or do they need the Holy
[1:05:04] Spirit if so please instruct us
[1:05:08] today how to receive the Holy
[1:05:12] Ghost we believe you are God's
[1:05:14] mouthpiece for our
[1:05:16] day and here is the

[1:15:41] love of
[1:15:44] God in the message a trumpet gives an
[1:15:46] uncertain
[1:15:49] sound praise God let me now via off you
[1:15:54] here amen any woman that's going to
[1:15:59] marry a
[1:16:00] man and she's not certain of that
[1:16:04] man she would better leave him
[1:16:07] alone and any man that's going to marry
[1:16:11] a
[1:16:11] woman and not
[1:16:13] certain you better leave her
[1:16:16] alone you'd better pray
[1:16:20] through on it until God gives you the
[1:16:25] answer until God gives you the
[1:16:30] answer and then when God joins together
[1:16:33] let no man put a
[1:16:38] what but we must first pray through on
[1:16:42] that who joins not the
[1:16:45] preacher who joins God
[1:16:49] joins now listen church he says he
[1:16:53] you must pray
[1:16:55] through if you're going to marry someone
[1:16:57] and you're not sure leave them alone
[1:17:01] pray
[1:17:02] through
[1:17:04] until God gives an answer why because
[1:17:09] God knows amen there is no trust and
[1:17:12] confidence in
[1:17:18] your that one will disappoint you did
[1:17:21] you know you cannot even trust
[1:17:25] yourself I can't even trust
[1:17:28] myself sometimes the things I think can
[1:17:31] do I surprise
[1:17:33] myself why because I'm a human being but
[1:17:37] listen when I receive that AG in my
[1:17:40] [Applause]
[1:17:41] soul then I begin to hear from God
[1:17:45] because I have the life of God in Me
[1:17:48] amen and God is leading me God is
[1:17:51] telling me what to do
[1:17:53] God is driving me so I will pray until
[1:17:57] I'm
[1:17:58] sure about anything and when I'm sure I
[1:18:02] would go and do it I remember when I was
[1:18:05] going to marry my wife I reached a place
[1:18:09] when I felt I wasn't sure I packed up my
[1:18:12] bags I packed up my bags and went to the
[1:18:16] village for a few days there praying and
[1:18:20] waiting for God to Spirit and God speak
[1:18:24] and confir it to me and I have an
[1:18:28] experience marriage should be an
[1:18:31] experience it shouldn't be something
[1:18:34] arranged marriage is not arranged by
[1:18:38] parents is not arranged by
[1:18:41] pastors marriage is not arranged by your
[1:18:44] feelings marriage is arranged by
[1:18:48] God and how do you know that she will
[1:18:51] deal with you and deal with her
[1:18:55] and it will all be lining towards one
[1:18:58] thing you bre through why do you pray
[1:19:02] because you can't trust
[1:19:05] your you can only
[1:19:10] trust in the
[1:19:14] of if we would
[1:19:16] stud what we are doing when we are going
[1:19:18] to get
[1:19:21] married when we choose our
[1:19:24] wife our husband if you would study it
[1:19:29] over a man should pray
[1:19:35] earnestly for he could ruin his entire
[1:19:39] life the reason why it is difficult for
[1:19:42] young people to find wives and
[1:19:46] husbands is because they're not filled
[1:19:49] with the Holy
[1:19:50] Spirit they don't have an experience
[1:19:52] with God
[1:19:54] they trying to find
[1:19:58] them oh she has beautiful
[1:20:01] eyes oh my God look
[1:20:04] at and then eventually no I'm not sure
[1:20:08] now what did she do I cannot I cannot I
[1:20:13] cannot if you if it is
[1:20:18] a and you find out they have
[1:20:21] HIV you can't turn
[1:20:25] [Music]
[1:20:27] away to
[1:20:31] them never
[1:20:34] fail when you Mar that
[1:20:37] person ifap that connected
[1:20:40] you you'll live together for
[1:20:44] forever until you
[1:20:46] die we won't even talk about
[1:20:49] divorce why AAP never fails
[1:20:53] [Music]
[1:20:54] why do young people fear to marry they
[1:20:56] say women are not easy men women are
[1:20:59] saying men are not
[1:21:01] easy because they all trusting in
[1:21:05] F never
[1:21:08] fails that's why a man must pray
[1:21:13] honestly but he should not even
[1:21:15] pray for a woman to marry or a man to
[1:21:19] marry before you receive the Holy Spirit
[1:21:24] find an experience with God
[1:21:26] [Music]
[1:21:28] first on the outer
[1:21:31] fast it's only and only then if you
[1:21:34] filled with the Holy Ghost that you can
[1:21:39] have before you get the Holy
[1:21:41] Spirit what you have is
[1:21:46] only and I can tell it will
[1:21:49] fail it's only a matter of time
[1:21:54] but
[1:21:56] love never
[1:22:00] fails praise God I'm continuing Remember
[1:22:05] The Vow is until death
[1:22:09] to and he could ruin his life by making
[1:22:12] the wrong
[1:22:16] choice but if he knows
[1:22:19] what he is making the wrong choice
[1:22:23] and he's Maring a woman that isn't fit
[1:22:25] to be his
[1:22:28] wife and he does it
[1:22:31] anyhow then it is his
[1:22:35] fault if the woman Tes a
[1:22:37] husband and knows that he is not fit to
[1:22:40] be a
[1:22:44] husband then you that's your own
[1:22:47] fault and after you know what is right
[1:22:49] and
[1:22:50] wrong so you shouldn't do it until you
[1:22:53] you've thoroughly pray
[1:22:59] through praise God praise God because of
[1:23:03] time I just continue down here
[1:23:05] now the St of a perfect
[1:23:08] man I might say something here The
[1:23:11] reason I believe now someone got me all
[1:23:15] wrong yeah not long ago I got a letter
[1:23:18] from a Ministry
[1:23:21] Association said that I believed that we
[1:23:24] were Soul
[1:23:27] mated and we must leave our companions
[1:23:30] if we are not Soul mated
[1:23:34] to to marry one another that we were
[1:23:37] Soul mated
[1:23:40] to I said I'm not guilty of a like
[1:23:45] that I've always been against
[1:23:48] that I don't believe in that
[1:23:53] that you are soul to
[1:23:55] someone no that's not true if there are
[1:23:59] people who are believing it
[1:24:00] here I want to tell you that's not
[1:24:06] true that it is you are compatible only
[1:24:08] to this
[1:24:12] one no that's not true he says certainly
[1:24:15] not I don't believe in
[1:24:17] that I believe that God gives us a med
[1:24:26] somebody tell somebody God gives us
[1:24:30] a hallelujah hallelujah God gives you a
[1:24:34] m like brother Andre God is giving you a
[1:24:39] m God give you sister
[1:24:42] f who is she she's from God she was just
[1:24:47] right close you to you and you didn't
[1:24:48] even know
[1:24:49] her but you remember I told you brother
[1:24:52] going
[1:24:53] prayer ask God and then guess what God
[1:24:57] gave
[1:24:58] you God gives you a
[1:25:01] man that's true and when we become part
[1:25:05] of each
[1:25:06] [Music]
[1:25:08] other and then we become part of each
[1:25:11] other after God brings
[1:25:14] her then you become part of each other
[1:25:17] but remember God
[1:25:20] gives you don't choose with your
[1:25:25] [Music]
[1:25:31] it's
[1:25:32] not
[1:25:34] it's if you choose someone
[1:25:41] [Music]
[1:25:46] using and that one cannot
[1:25:49] fail and before a man gets married
[1:25:53] you should think these things over and
[1:25:55] study
[1:25:58] it a young man asked me the other
[1:26:01] day he said you think I could ow to get
[1:26:04] married brother Bram to such and such a
[1:26:10] girl can I Mar sister this
[1:26:13] one I said how much do you think of
[1:26:18] her now this quot has been
[1:26:19] misrepresented many times
[1:26:23] I wanted to hear cler and I said how
[1:26:26] much do you think of
[1:26:28] her he said
[1:26:31] oh I just love
[1:26:36] her and I said well if you are not going
[1:26:40] to live without
[1:26:43] her you better Mar her
[1:26:45] then but if you can live without
[1:26:49] her you better not here is someone
[1:26:54] coming to a prophet of
[1:26:56] God he says look I love this
[1:27:01] [Music]
[1:27:05] person so you want me to tell you
[1:27:07] whether you should marry or
[1:27:09] not he says if you can't live without
[1:27:13] her then marry
[1:27:16] her there is something I want you to
[1:27:19] see do you know we can live with without
[1:27:24] anyone but we can't live without
[1:27:28] Jesus without
[1:27:36] God is onlyy to
[1:27:38] say if
[1:27:43] you then love Mar
[1:27:45] her but if it's just a feeling like I
[1:27:48] see
[1:27:50] you then you better not
[1:27:54] so but it's going to kill
[1:27:56] you you better you better go ahead and
[1:27:58] get
[1:27:59] married if he going to kill you the only
[1:28:03] thing that would kill
[1:28:04] me is if you take Jesus out of
[1:28:08] me but if you take anything and
[1:28:11] everything and give me Jesus then I will
[1:28:15] be alive and Jesus
[1:28:19] is that's a fruit that shows
[1:28:23] is in my
[1:28:26] soul was not
[1:28:29] saying you like you
[1:28:32] flying then marry her
[1:28:35] no we've seen them like
[1:28:38] that and then they Chang their
[1:28:42] mind even on the just before the of the
[1:28:47] wedding and others mared one
[1:28:50] year are no longer love
[1:28:53] but you you said you can't
[1:28:55] without I
[1:28:57] can what was wrong at
[1:29:00] first I did not see
[1:29:02] properly it
[1:29:05] was it was just
[1:29:08] feelings in your
[1:29:10] emotions but it wasn't a choice of God
[1:29:16] through and so what I was trying to get
[1:29:19] to
[1:29:20] him what brother bam is saying what I
[1:29:23] was trying to get to the younger
[1:29:26] man that if you love her so
[1:29:31] much he he was trying to tell is saying
[1:29:35] he was trying to bring to the young
[1:29:38] man to make him understand if you love
[1:29:40] her so
[1:29:42] much then but again I ask which
[1:29:46] love the love which does not
[1:29:50] fail now right now before you are
[1:29:54] married and everything is just fine and
[1:30:00] Dy you seeing her beauty you're seeing
[1:30:03] his his good
[1:30:05] looks and um
[1:30:07] then now but after you get married the
[1:30:12] toils of Life
[1:30:16] Tri that's when you've got to be so in
[1:30:18] love that you understand one
[1:30:20] another
[1:30:24] when you are disappointed in
[1:30:26] her she disappointed in
[1:30:30] you you still understand one
[1:30:34] another if you you are dis if you
[1:30:36] disappoint one
[1:30:38] another you still
[1:30:45] understand what is it it is not your
[1:30:49] natural
[1:30:50] love it's not human
[1:30:52] love it
[1:30:56] Tak love Beyond
[1:30:58] [Music]
[1:30:59] mistakes the Bible says love covers a
[1:31:03] multitude of
[1:31:09] [Music]
[1:31:11] sins
[1:31:13] amen praise
[1:31:16] God even when she does this he does this
[1:31:19] you
[1:31:20] understand that's the way it is with
[1:31:23] Christ we've got to be so in love with
[1:31:27] him till when we ask for
[1:31:31] something and he doesn't give it to us
[1:31:34] that doesn't shake us
[1:31:37] a Hallelujah don't love Jesus with ph
[1:31:42] love love him with his own
[1:31:48] love whether he loves you rather whether
[1:31:51] he doesn't give you what you want or
[1:31:53] whether you say whether oh If It Makes
[1:31:56] You Happy take me to
[1:31:59] hell I will love
[1:32:02] you whether it makes you happy to make
[1:32:06] me poor I will love
[1:32:09] you now that
[1:32:13] is
[1:32:15] love this kind of love of give me I give
[1:32:19] you see me I see you
[1:32:25] it fails
[1:32:27] soon whe whether it doesn't give it we
[1:32:30] still love
[1:32:32] him why and the only way you can do
[1:32:38] that the only way you can do that is to
[1:32:42] become
[1:32:43] [Music]
[1:32:45] partakers of his divine
[1:32:50] nature
[1:32:52] by receiving the Holy
[1:32:54] Ghost then you will
[1:32:57] understand the reason he canot give it
[1:33:00] to
[1:33:05] you take of his divine
[1:33:10] nature that is why for those that have
[1:33:13] this
[1:33:14] nature tells them ask whatever you
[1:33:20] want why because he knows you are not
[1:33:23] going to ask
[1:33:26] for you're not going to ask for
[1:33:30] fornication but he knows you going to
[1:33:33] ask for what is in
[1:33:35] him your nature is
[1:33:39] his your life is his
[1:33:42] life and you are
[1:33:46] him Colossians 3:14 as we
[1:33:49] finish and above all these things
[1:33:52] things put on
