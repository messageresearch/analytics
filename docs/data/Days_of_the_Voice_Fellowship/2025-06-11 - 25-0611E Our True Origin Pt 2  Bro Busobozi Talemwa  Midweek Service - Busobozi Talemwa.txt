[Music] Oh, I made [Music] shout forever forever in a Sunday. Let us pray. If you have a need, just uh make it known by an uplifted hand as we pray. Our dear loving father, we come to you this evening. Lord, as your children have gathered, come from different places, some are tired from work, Lord, but they have come to be here in your presence, Lord. Some are streaming from afar, able to be here with us. Lord, we desire one thing Lord that you will say something which will impact our life positively. Lord, that you will move us closer to your coming, Lord. that you'll bring us a realization of the hour we are living in and what you're doing Lord around us and in us. My prayer Lord is that you will uh make us focus our eyes on you not on the things around us. And even Lord anybody could be going through something. I pray that you let their minds stay be stayed on you tonight that they will not stray to the left or to the right but they will look unto you Lord. We may all look unto you tonight, the author and the finisher of our faith. You are the the great one among us this evening and we ask that you may be seen. Lord, may you take me out of the way, my brother Henry Henry, and may you come and speak, Lord. We just coveret your presence. Grant it we pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you saints. Good evening. Amen. Turn to your neighbor. Tell them go you're welcome to the house. Amen. Amen. Yesterday um I had traveled with brother Shalom and brother Amram to go and see a few of our young people who are not here. I know you've you were not told previously but brother Praise is no longer on the organ because he went to the host. in Mitana at Central College there. So he's um uh of course going to be there for two years. Uh of course he will always be with us on the on the holidays. So we went to see him yesterday. Also, sister patience is not here. Because she also joined the host over what's the name of the school at Budo Christian School. And I'm happy that they at least can be able to attend the services at uh with brother Jesse uh also brother Noble uh who so both the the organists at school. So um but I think brother Noble should be really able to come on the weekends. Praise the Lord. Amen. And many of our young people of course are in in schools. But nevertheless, I just loved it that when brother Policy was at school. When he came back, he went for to the last sermon he had and he listened to all of them. Said he never wanted to be left behind. I encourage to all students when you go to school when you come back go back and see whatever was preached. Let us uh open our Bibles to the book of uh Luke chapter 23. We are continuing with our study that we had on Sunday. Uh, so this will be a part two of our true origin. I wasn't supposed to preach it as part two, but it's just a continuation because we never finished on Sunday. Excuse me. Vers 39 23. Luke 239. [Music] And one of the male factors which were which were hanged railed on him saying, "If thou be Christ, save thyself and us." But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dust not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? [Music] And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds. But this man has done nothing a miss. And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, verily I say unto thee, today shalt thou be with me in paradise. Amen. You may be seated. Brother, if you can help us with those echoes, I think you need to bring it down a little bit. Uh, our true origin. Now saints, the subject that we're dealing with um I should say is the purpose why God sent us the end time message. Are we all here now? We have only a short time this evening. put your thoughts together. Do not allow anything to distract you. Amen. Let us stay together and let's see what the Lord will grant us this evening. And I'm so happy that we have been able to come in his presence. He he you know whenever we come uh he wants to minister to us. Happy to see sister fortunate. Amen. So now you remember the subject, we remember the scriptures we read last on Sunday. One of them actually the very first one we began with is um Jesus um okay we started with the one where Jesus was asking the disciples who the people said he was. [Music] And people had many um you know they thought he was one of the prophets. So they could not go beyond what they they were seeing. Brother Daniel, brother Isaac, please stay your focus your minds here. I I don't want I don't want you to miss this. This is not just another sermon. If you miss it, you you've missed It's a it's an inspiration that God gave me and I pray that we don't really miss it. So the people were really um the the disciples told him what people thought of him and it was true. Jesus was the son of man at the time. He was a prophet. As a son of man he was a prophet. So now when people say that he was a prophet They were right. But you see, they they did not see beyond the badger skin, the the flesh. They only could see what they were seeing. And so they could define Jesus by what they were seeing. You understand? They could not go beyond what they were seeing. And the world can only define us by the way they seeing us. They can't see beyond this flesh. And many people actually living in this world today. They define themselves. We define ourselves by what we are seeing. And this is many times the family we are born in, the failures we have in this life, the problems we we face, the challenges we face and then we end up defining ourselves by those things and we cannot go beyond those things to see that our origin. Look, if you what you see of yourself shows what you see of your origin, whose son are you? Whose child are you? What what tribe are you? What culture are you from? That is if you can answer all those questions, what comes to mind? You say I'm a musa from Cami. My father is so and so. That's what you see. But a true son of God is beyond all that. A true son of God is none of anything that you just mentioned. A true son of God is a spirit being. He came from God. A true son of God has always been a part of God. He came into this world to be manifested that he may do what? Destroy the works of Satan and then go back to where he came from. If you really are a Bible reader, you will just know I was quoting a verse speaking about Jesus. He was manifested into this world that he may do what? Destroy the works of Satan. And then he will go back to God. He said, "I came from God. I go back." And and so you see Jesus he was able to overcome not because he was not a human being. Jesus was a human being like all of us. But Jesus saw more than what others saw of him. Jesus knew his true origin. Jesus knew he did not come from Mary. Jesus knew he did not come from Joseph. Jesus knew. He came from God. And by the way, that's the victory that overcomes the world. And I am going to begin by uh reading and I I read this for somebody yesterday. This is not in my notes. It has come to me again. We have read this quote multiple multiple times but we shall read it until you receive the revelation. I'm just going to read a little portion. But the bottom says uh the devil cannot stand the book of revelation. He fights it and he wants to make he says the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm making the church formal making the church powerless. It exposes Satan by revealing his works. The works of Satan. What are the works of Satan? The works of Satan is the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire. He cannot stand it. He knows. Now this is what Satan knows. He knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is, if you got it, say amen. Now in this case, brother did not say that if the Satan knows that if the church will receive the true revelation of Jesus Christ. No. But if the church will receive the true revelation of the true church and what the true church is. If you the church receive that revelation and what she stands for and that she can do the greater work, she the church will be an invisible army. The devil knows that that is the only revelation which can defeat all of hell. And he will try to keep us from that revelation. This cannot be told to you. You have to receive it from God. If you don't have a revelation of who you are, you will do everything the world does. You will live like the world. You will dress like the world. You will speak like the world. You will do things like the world. But when you know who you are, you cannot be defined by what the world says or does. And that is the message of the hour. The purpose of of the revelation of the seven seal so the church can know who she is. Hallelujah. All these doctrines. Amen. All the doctrines that we teach are good. They are very fine. But let me tell you, we need to go beyond the doctrine. The message is not doctrines. The message is not even rules, laws, what we should do and what we should not do. If that is the message then there are others who are better than us there are many things I have to say but I will take it in portions and this evening I'm going to also take it in portions and I will quit and next Sunday I I will add on May God help us to understand each other there are people who are better than us in rules if The end time message are rules about holiness and what we should do and what we should not do. There are those who are much better than us. If you don't know, go and research about a church called the apostolic church. It's a holiness movement. We I found the I got my first encounter with them was in Ethiopia. My friend, you think we preach holiness? Wait until you go to them. That's when you will know in the message. We are not even preaching holiness. If if you think that holiness is a is a works of righteousness, they believe in cleanness and holiness. sister. Their sisters dressed very well. You won't find one with tight anything. You won't find anyone with earrings. You won't find one anyone with nose jewels, even makeup, even lipstick. They will not even wear jewelry. necklace. They will not wear not even rings. They will not wear because it is unholy. According to them, all jewelry is sinful. But our prophet has taught us otherwise. He he told us it has no problem depending on the motive. That's why we wear rings. That's why he said if your husband buys you necklace he said it is okay. So on that basis they are better than us. They preach holiness better than us. Are you are you following me? Are you following me church? So if you are to say we should teach holiness and that's it. Some people are better than us. If you say we preach healing, miracles, signs and wonders and then you want to tell us that if if you have that, you have everything. Let me tell you, there are people who are better at it. Sometimes I see some message believers, preachers who want to bring Pentecostalism back into the message. We in the message believe in healing, signs, miracles and wonders. But we understand also that is only the first and second pool of anointing. The message is beyond that. But but we believe in healing. Amen. I've seen healing in my ministry. and and we agree with it. But if I I begin to lift it and make it look like if nobody has a healing ministry like mine and I make my entire ministry all about healing, then I am not preaching the message of the hour. Can do better. If you want miracles, go to miracle center. Serious miracles. Real miracles. Okay, you can debate whether they are real or not. But according to the message, I believe they are real miracles because brother Bham preached anointed ones at the end time. He said the anointing is right but they are false. Why are they false? Because they do not have the right message and talked about revival. That was a real I had time to go and give you all the examples and they have measured on the Holy Ghost as a subject. If you have got the Holy Ghost, you have it all. But you see the Bible says I it's not my subject today, but he says, let us let us, you know, leave these principles of the doctrine of Christ and he he mentions the principles, the foundations and he says uh of the doctrine of repentance. Amen. So if you want to preach about repentance, there are better people who preach about repentance. There is a man here in Kenya, he preaches repentance. How many know him with a long beard? Yeah. If you hear him preach about repentance, you will say truly this is the Elijah which was to come. But that is the foundation. That is the beginning. Repentance from dead works. It doesn't mean we should not preach repentance. The message is a full package. Amen. The message Amen. We are it's the crowning of the whole building. But you see the building is not just crown. You have to build from ground. So all these denominations you see and movements and revival they are somewhere in the building but others are stuck in the foundation. They have never left. You you go back and read it says you see it says the um the the the doctrine of repentance from dead works. The Holy Spirit is just leading me to read things which I did not prepare to read. Oh my. I want you to uh to be attentive tonight. Therefore, living the principles Hebrews 6 of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection. So there are principles, the foundational principles that everybody must believe as long as they believe in Christ. And one of them it says is the doctrine of repentance from dead works. What is it? Foundation. Everybody say foundation. That's a foundational doctrine. Every Bible church must believe it. repentance from dead works. We believe in repentance. We preach repentance. But our message is more than repentance. Amen. We are in a last age. We're in the last day. We are the roofing of the church. The head has come down. We are no longer right at the foot. We are right at the at the crowning of the old sea. The head has come down. The opening of the seals tell us the head has come down. All right. But but you see the foundation is repentance from dead works and faith toward God. There are people who can preach faith. For us in our church, we don't preach faith. We don't major on it. This message is not about just preaching about faith. If you want to hear people who preached about faith, there are many like uh Toss about like or Robert about and we have many like them in the world today who are preaching faith and is a very wonderful thing but it is a foundational doctrine. Every believer and every Bible church should preach and believe in faith. Can we say amen to that? But you see that is the foundation. The bride has something more than that. Amen. The bride has grown and is growing into perfection. Then you see of the doctrine of baptism. Amen. Baptisms. There are different types of baptism. There is water baptism. There is Holy Ghost baptism. These are all foundational doctrines of the Christian faith. Everyone who believes is baptized in water and God fills them with the Holy Ghost. That is a must. That is a foundation. If anyone rejects this, they have rejected the Bible. They have rejected the doctrine of Christ. It's a foundation and we all believe it. But I tell you what, we are going farther more than that. We cannot lay a calm around water baptism. We are not Baptists. We cannot lay a camp just holy ghost baptism. You know, we are not Pentecostals. Come on church. We are going out to where unto perfection. Oh my my my my. You see then he says the doctrine of laying on of hands. All these are principles of the doctrine of Christ. Laying on of hands. Amen. That's why you know where we have arrived. You know we are no longer all about prayer lines. You know prayer line, prayer line, prayer line. We we are in the third phase of this ministry. Are you following me church? Amen. We are at a place where we are speaking and things materialize. As I'm preaching to you, you are in a prayer line. Amen. If I am an unadopted son of God, you're coming to a place where the world is created. Amen. All right. Our faith each of us is not the same. Our level of growth is not the same. That is why we still handle prayer line. We believe the Bible said this we will do. If the Lord permits, I will still do it even today. But you know what? You have to grow. You have to come on to perfection. You have to know it's no longer about the prayer line. It's no longer about pastor touch me. Do this. It's no longer about the pastor. You have come to a place where you realize you realize Look, I'm a son of God. If I know who I am, I have the authority. I have the power. Where is it? It's not in the pastor. It's not in a holy priest. It is in me as a believer. This sign should follow them. Everybody that believe in power to bind to lose in a holy priesthood. It is in every believer. You see this is the purpose of the seven seals of the of the opening of the seals and I'm coming to that. It may take a few services but I will eventually get there. Now as we are getting into it you may not understand everything. All right. And then he says uh the resurrection of the dead. You know it's a principle the rapture. Are you the only ones who preach the rapture? You go and listen to he preaches the rapture better than some of us. So it's not only exclusive to the message church. There are some who don't believe in the rapture, but there are some who really do and they preach it so well and they place it so well in the Bible. Why? Because it is a a principle of the doctrine of Christ. It is a foundation. It's not only exclusive to us message believers. When you preach the rapture, you are not yet preaching the message. When you preach the the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you are not yet preaching the message, when you're preaching water baptism in Jesus name, you are not preaching the message yet. There are others who do preach those things and they're not even in the message. When you're preaching repentance, you are not yet preaching the message. When you're preaching laying on of you, you are not yet there. What is the message? Oh, I want to show you church. Amen. As we will see, let me summarize it right now. What is the message? The message is you realizing who you are, the revelation of a true church and what you stand for. My God, may God help us to see these things and eternal judgment. And apostle Paul says, "And this we will do if God permit." And we have kept on doing. When we go out, we preach, people believe, we baptize them. God permits it. But let me tell you what you need to go to the rapture. What you need for the change of your is not a doctrine of water baptism. It's not a doctrine of repentance. There's not a doctrine of that. There's not a teaching on that. What you need is a revelation of who you are. Hallelujah. I will prove to you by the Bible. There is somebody here in the Bible who made it into the other dimension without ever knowing any doctrine. Hallelujah. But the only thing in you he had received a revelation of who Jesus was. If you receive the revelation of who Jesus is, then you will receive a revelation of the future and what you stand for. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. But if you receive a revelation of the true church, Amen. you. It means you have revelation of of the of of who Jesus Christ is. And if you get a chance, you will fulfill the doctrine of Christ. If that man had left that cross, the first thing he would have done is to be watered. But God never permitted. So what happened? He went straight into the other. Hallelujah. So Jesus asked the disciples, "Who do they say I am?" They say you are this. What about you? What do you say I am? Amen. Peter, by revelation, he said, "You are Jesus Christ, the son of the living. You are more than a man. You are God in flesh." Amen. And Jesus said, "Oh Peter, flesh and blood have revealed this to you, but my father in heaven and upon this revelation, I will build my church." The church of Jesus is built upon the revelation, but who Jesus is. The true church knows who Jesus is. Amen. Even today, we know who Jesus is. It's not because they preach repentance. We can know that's not Jesus. It's not because they they have signs and wonders. We can know that's not Jesus. We know who Jesus is. We know the revelation. Who is he? He's more than a religion. He's more than a denomination. He's more than a man. He's more than a c. He's more than following a religion. He's more than a set of rules. People will tell you which church do you go to and they're confused. They think the church you go to is equals to Jesus. But this message is beyond denomination. Is beyond your church name. Now we have a revelation. It's no longer about your church name. Jesus. Amen. Is not your church name. Jesus is the word. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Friends, and then I showed you another scripture, the devil himself tempting Jesus. And he told him, um, if you be the son of God, make these stones bright. you be the servant. So the devil doubted who Jesus was. Now we see but the bottom says Jesus knew who he was. He knew he was not about to know. He knew that is the only thing that made Jesus overcome the world. He knew who he was. No matter what situation he found himself in he knew who he was. He knew nothing can change who he is. He knew where he came from. He knew where he was going. Amen. He knew he was the beginning and he was the end. And that's the same thing that the church must know. And that's why God sent Elijah to for us to know who we are what we stand for. The devil can't defeat us. Amen. Who are we? We are sons of God. Amen. Amen. What does it say in the word? But now we are sons of God. Amen. It does not yet appear what we shall be. But we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him. We shall be like him. We shall be like him. No more sick, no more death, no more problems, no more suffering, no more blind, no more lust, no more foolishness, no more debate. We shall be like him. No more church and denomination. No more blind and lazy. We shall be like him. Amen. And that's the purpose of the opening of the seals because the seals when they were removed, what is the contents there? The names of all those that were redeemed. Amen. Went before the foundation. So you are the seals revealed. Hallelujah. Stop complicating it. It's all about you. That's why he said behold I send you. Hallelujah. Come on now. Yes. He said I send you. I send you Elijah the prophet. It's not about Elijah. It's about me. It's about the church. Oh, if the true church, we know who she is. Amen. Who is she? She's a son of God. She's a part of God. Amen. Blood of blood and of God. But we have a lot of problems around us. Oh God, I'm poor. How am I going to pay my rent? And then the devil makes you to think you are. You are poor. Oh God, I'm sick. How am I going to overcome this sickness? Uhuh. But when you receive this revelation, you realize something no one has known. You realize who you are. You are not this piece of flesh. You are beyond what they know. You are beyond what they see. You are beyond what you feel. Then when temptation comes like Jesus when temptation came he stood still because he knew who he was. So devil, give me a break, please. You know I'm lusting after food. My stomach is hurting. Please don't tempt me. Oh God, don't let the devil temp. Take him away. Let me go for a fasting and prayer for 40 days to cast away the demon of last for food. You get the point. That's why we don't do those kind of fasts Pentecostals do. You get the point. If you don't have the revelation of what I'm talking about, you are going to misunderstand this sermon today. We believe in fasting. Jesus fasted also by revelation and our first fasting must be done by revelation. God puts a fast on you. You don't have to collect everybody. Let's fast. When he puts it on you, to pray, he went for days, four nights, he was praying fasting. And he knew he was by the time he's coming out. So we devil comes. He didn't call for reinforcement. On the cross, he cried. as a man. But right here, right here, when he was being tempted, he never cried for God to come and help him. What was being done on the cross was the will of God. It was God punishing him, uplifting him for you, and for me. But right here, right here. It was not the will of God that the devil will finish him and overcome him. So Jesus overcame how by knowing who he was. He didn't cry. He didn't pray. He didn't beg. He he did not plead with the devil. He stood with him. face to face. It wasn't that the devil was standing there. The devil was standing in his mind. He stands in our mind every day. Some of you is talking to you right now, telling you negative things and you're fighting. The greatest battle ever fought were in the mind. And he's telling you things causing you to unbelieve. But what makes you overcome the world? When you know who you are, you then you know what you need to to use to overcome the world. The word the word the word because you and the word are not separate. You and the word are one. Jesus said, "I and my father are one." Amen. And we know I and Jesus are one. Who is he? The word. So the word is not here. The word is not here. Are you hearing me, brother? The word is not here. It is in here. The word is in me. I am the word made flesh today. We are the word made flesh today. This is what the scriptures say. But you see, you can't just understand it. Your head will bust. You have to receive it by revenge. But when temptation comes, you can be bold before temptation and speak the word. When you speak the word, that word. Hallelujah. That's what meant. That word will overcome the devil any place, any time, anywhere, any situation. Which word? That word which you speak by revelation. Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. How will the rapture be? Amen. It's not flying like flying saucers. We are going to walk into another by revelation. You will know how to walk in. By revelation, you will know how to put off this flesh and how to dress on another by revelation. It's happening now. It's a process. Something is happening on the inside and slowly is manifesting on the outside. The bride realizing who she is. Praise the name of the Lord. See Jesus stood I will not go through it again. Then in John we read where he was with the disciples where he was with the Jews and they kept on asking him question. And when he said before Abraham was I am they said you are crazy. You are a Samaritan. You are crazy. You have a devil in you. We have to stone you. We have to kill you. And they wanted to kill you because they thought he's a man making himself. So my brother, grow in faith. You are not just a man. You are not just a woman. Amen. Hallelujah. That must be the revelation. The believers in the dark ages. They said, "Kill us. Kill me also." What happened to them? Their minds. Have they gone crazy? had seen that there was another land where they came from. This one doesn't count for anything. When brother left his flesh, he looked down. He saw the mugs and everything lowered down. This body looked down. He didn't want to come back. brother. That's why when you realize who you are, you will stop wanting if you're a woman to use makeup and you will throw them away. The happy that you will be lost that desire for the minisc automatically you lose it. And those who see you as a human being, they will say what's wrong with you? But you who sees yourself as more than a human being, you know you are not natural. You are super hallelujah. This is the victory that overcome the world. Amen. Hallelujah. To know there is something more than what we see. Amen. We are sons of God. To be a son of God means to be God. That's what it means. So you are God. You are you are but the Bible says you are a messiah height. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You are not just a piece of clay. [Music] This house of grace going to b wide open bone that hold my soul. See one time when it bust wide open we come out. Can you realize pastor? I remember what you were preaching. I can now truly see who I am. And I'll tell you yes. That's what I was saying. This is your true origin. If you think you born in you, change your mind. Hallelujah. They may bury your body there. It doesn't matter how you get in. It matters how you come out. You may be so rich. We know about Alexander the Great. He was a rich king. He had everything all the gold and but when he became sick, no doctor could heal him. He died a sick man. But he said, "I wanted to put my hands off the coffin. I want everybody to know we come into the world with nothing. We go away with nothing. I want to go over the goal. Let everybody step by. [Music] Let them know the riches of this world. They are nothing. I want the best doctors in our country to carry my casket. No doctor can heal you. No doctor has the medicine to heal you. It's only God who has authority over. So you may go in your grave as a lame person as a sick person, as a blind person. But I tell you what, the grave is not your origin. You have an origin. You came from God. You go back to God. You will come out. Amen. Hallelujah. Square. There is no lamb. There is no blind. There is no lustful. There is no weak. There is no poor person. Hallelujah. Everybody is perfect. Everybody's holy. Holy as God is holy. You know what? That is our true origin. Friend, when you get to know it, you just lose your mind. meaning you will get to see what others can't see and you'll get to speak what others can't see and they will call you crazy but they are the ones who have lost their mind when you come to yourself shake up yourself you say hey I can't live in fornication no that's too Lord, I have a better life. I'm a royal priesthood. The world thinks there are no people who can live holy. The Bible says be holy even as he is holy. And the world says it is impossible. But there are people still in flesh like Jesus was who know it is possible because they living just that not by their power by their mind. Something that keeps holding you because you receive a revelation of your true origin. Hallelujah. Amen. Friends, it's an exciting revelation. You see the the the disciples came to him. Excuse me. The father and mother came. They said, Mary said, "H Jesus, you boy, your father and I have been looking for you. Your father, my father, and you. Who do you think you are? They thought he was a boy, a little Jew. He told them, "Don't you know I must be about my father's business? Mary rejected the virgin birth. He told you know it is women who give children." So he told Jesus, "Your father is Joseph." Jesus said, "Hey, correction, correction." He is not my father. The f the business he was carrying out was not Joseph's business. Joseph's business was carpentry. The business he was doing in the temple was his father's business. Who was his father? So who is he? A son of God. So who is his father? God. Hallelujah. Jesus knew who he was. He knew he was God in flesh. You should also know who you are. When your mother says, "Look at this one." That's why you are stupid in your clan. You just laugh and say, "You don't know what you're talking about." In our clan, we are perfect. I come from God. I go back to God. God bless you, brother M. That's where we come from. All these foolish things of that happen in this world. That's why all the covenants that your grandfathers made and they have been binding all the children in that lineage. You come to a place when you pass into this revelation and you say all those don't belong to me. They are to me to me all these covenants. I am in a new covenant. My father is Jesus Christ. and I am his son and also he's my brother. He's my mother. He's my friend. He's my everything. Don't you see? It sounds like crazy, but they are the ones who are crazy because they have no revelation of who you are. Amen. Jesus told them, I am here doing my father's. That's why no matter what you're doing in this world, brother, you may have a good job, it doesn't count. What you saw in your father's business matters. We have to have revelation, friends. The time you give to the Lord, the money you give to the work of God, the Bible says, make yourselves friends of the unrighteous mmon. But when you fail, it will deliver you in the into the harvesting. You know what? Money. How can money do something after you are dead? is what you did with it when you were you on earth to sew into the kingdom of God into the work of God. Amen. Because you knew your father's business when you passed from this life. Well done my good and faith. Whatever you are doing, it's a job, it's a whatever business, whatever, focus on doing your father's business. That's why even if you're a worker, you serve your boss as unto the Lord, do it well to the glory of God. Do it for the children of God. Do it for God. Do it for the children of God. God so that you will gain. Don't be selfish. Don't be self-centered. That's a man who doesn't know who they are. But he who knows who they are. They'll realize it's not about me as a human being. It's about me as a son of God and about my brother and about my sister as a as as a daughter of God. Praise the name of the Lord. The thief on the cross will finish with this now. I've not even read any quote or anything and I wanted to but it's all right. So see this man factor. There were two of them hanged on each side of Jesus and one of them came to Jesus rather not coming but he spoke to Jesus. He said to him, "If thou be the Christ, does that sound familiar? If thou be the son of God, command his stones to be made bread, brother." Here's another if. If thou be Christ, the devil and and his sons, the devil and his serpent seed, The serpent and his seed has always doubted who Jesus is. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The serpent and his seat today doubt who you are. Hallelujah. What? The bride of Christ, perfect people, rapture. There is no such a group of people like that. All churches are deceived. Deceive one. They just don't know. They will always doubt you. They will mistake you for others. They did the same to Jesus. And this m fact I said if thou be the Christ save us and yourself they always want to see a miracle or sign a wonder. Can you imagine? Same thing happened with the devil. He wanted to see a miracle. And that's why the world is so hungry for miracles. Did you know that? Look at all the mega churches. Why are they mega? Because the the leaders of those churches are claiming to do miracles. That is what makes the mega churches. Did Jesus have a mega church? Yes. At one point, why? Because of the miracles he did, he turned fish into many fish. [Music] They all came. They all came. How many? 5,000 10,000 15,000. There were more than 15,000. Jesus had a mega church. And then he began after the miracles. He said, "All right, all right, all right. Let us open the the seventh seal now. What? No, no, no, no, no, no. Please give us the first pool. Give us the second pool. This third pool is very difficult for us. It sounds as if you're a C. We want the power the miracle then we shall come. He said you can go and that's why the message churches are the smallest in the world. Why? Because they are the only churches which are operating in the third realm. the third phase of the ministry of Jesus Christ. And Jesus answer asked them, "Do you also want to go?" He said, "No, who can we go that has the word of eternal life?" The bride all over the world is interested in the world, in the opening of the world. Yes sir. Amen. And so here write again the male factors they they told uh Jesus save yourself and us you on the cross like us do a miracle somehow. Let's get off the cross. Did Jesus answer that? Read your Bible. Go go go go go go back and read it very well. Luke 239 Jesus answered nothing do a miracle for us. That's why in the in the dark ages when they persecuting killing them Jesus never did miracles for them. What did he do? He said, "I know. I know you're suffering the suffering of this present time is not worthy to to be compared with the glory shall be revealed here. The bride is preparing herself for the body change. Hallelujah. And right here, friends, right here, the other answered him. And I want you to see the other thief on the cross. And he rebuked this one. He said, "What? Don't you fear God?" Who told this man, Sister M? Think about it. Who told this man that this was God? Have you thought about it? It was by revelation. Hallelujah. The other one said, "If you be the Christ," and this one said, "Don't you fear God?" saying, "Thou art come in the same condemnation. Indeed, we justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds." This man has done nothing. How did he know that? Revelation. And he said unto Jesus, now if you were doubting whether he knew whether he was God or not, listen. And he turned to Jesus and he said, "Lord, Lord, Isaiah 42, I am the Lord. That is my name." Amen. A praise. I will not give to any grave in the image. I am the Lord. You see, he said that is my name. Here is a thief on the cross who had never read Isaiah 42. We can say that Paul said, "Who are you my Lord?" Paul was a scholar. He must have read it somewhere. But this one had never read. He was a thief. He was a sinner. Never been in any church service. And he's saying to Jesus, Lord, remember me. When thou comest into thy kingdom, how did he know this man has a kingdom? He must have known who he was. When you receive a revelation of who Jesus Christ is, you are the church. Now you are on the foundation upon this rock, I will build my church and the gate of hell shall not prevail against. And this man by realizing who Jesus is. Amen. He had been laid on the foundation. Upon this rock, I would be in my church. Please listen to me as I'm finishing. At this moment, this man became the church. Hallelujah. Are you getting it, sister? This man became the child because he had received a revelation and he said upon this revelation of what? Of who Jesus Christ is. So he had received a revelation of who Jesus is and on that very moment he became the church. And that's why Jesus could not be silent. Hallelujah. Jesus will not be silent. When you know who he is, brother, when you know who he is, sister Jesus will not be silent on you. Hallelujah. In that day before they call, I will answer. That's the millennium. But potentially because we're in heavenly places, we claim it even today. [Music] What is your need? Before you call, he will answer. Before you call, he will answer. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Jesus said unto him, verily I say unto thee, today my my myle. Oh, I feel so good right now. Today, tell somebody today. Today shalt thou be with me in paradise? Oh, can someone preach with me right now? Amen. What is your desire? If you have received a revelation of who Jesus Christ is to you and you know who you are, you are the church. And I said to you right now today, you shall receive your Amen. And Jesus taught to the man and said, "Today, thou shalt be with me in paradise." Does Jesus mean what he's saying? Does he mean what? Does he say what he mean is the same yesterday? Today, today, and forever. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You remember there was something I was preaching some time back and a revelation struck me. I said how many want clothing? All those people got clos spoken word spoken word and things will be manifested. So what do you need today? If you need to overcome sin, if you are here right now and you want to overcome sin in the name of Jesus, you're overcoming right now. God is giving you power, right in your body, right in your spirit. You may be online right now. I don't care where you are. Everybody stand up on your feet. The Lord is giving you grace. He's giving you strength right now. And you are overcoming right now. You're over. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. S received strength. S received strength. Listen, brother. S received strength. In her body, she was barren. But when the strength came, she was able to bring forth a child. In the name of Jesus Christ, you are receiving strength right now. If you receive that revelation, what do you need to overcome? Come on, don't walk away. Don't walk away. Still defeated. You are receiving strength now. S never felt anything. You may not feel anything, but the word of God is creative. You are receiving strength right now. for your need. For your need. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Everybody begin to worship the Lord. Begin to pray and call on the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah, Lord. Hallelujah. Oh yes, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah, Lord. Yes, Lord Jesus. Oh, strike everybody with your revelation, Lord. Let them know who you are. Let them know who you are that they may know who they are in this evil hour. They will overcome and live beyond what they see and live beyond their failures and live beyond their sin and live beyond their problems and live beyond their failures and live beyond their weaknesses in the name of Jesus Christ. Yes, Lord. May you let your spirit move and do the miraculous Lord because you're the miracle working. You never fail Lord. You are the I am that I am. You're the present God right now. Yes, Lord Jesus. Whatever you believe you can receive today. You can receive today. I tell you, test and see. That the Lord is good and his faithfulness is new every morning. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What do you believe God for? Today you can receive it. Today you can receive it because he's a faithful God. He is a God who never fails. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you Jesus. [Music] How long [Music] [Music] you [Music] worshipless. [Applause] [Music] Thank you for your mercy. Thank you for your loving kindness, Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus.

If anybody asks you, hallelujah, just who I am, I tell you, you can tell thee I am redeemed. I'll tell of his favor. I'll tell of his love. I'll tell his goodness to me. Hallelujah. [Music] He purchased my redemption with his own precious blood and from sin. Hallelujah. I've been set free. [Music] I know I am redeemed. But with the price, Jesus has changed my whole life. Hallelujah. If anybody asks you just who I am, tell thee I am redeemed. Thank you, Lord. Oh, if you can sing it, let us sing one more time. I am redeemed, bought with the price. Jesus has changed my whole life. Oh, if anybody asks you just who I am. Just tell them I am redeemed. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Yes, you have redeemed me, oh God. You have redeemed us. Brought us into the kingdom of your dear son. We are standing here, Lord. Oh, because we are redeemed. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Before we give our offerings, I wonder if brother Amaran can come and let us sing. He made a way. You made a way. You made a way. You made a way. Hallelujah. And he has redeemed us into the kingdom of his dear son. You made a way. [Music] You made our way. when our backs were against the wall. Hallelujah. And it looked as if it was over.

Hallelujah. Lord understanding only because you made. Everybody sing you made a way. You made a way. Hallelujah. Made our way. [Music] When our backs were against the wall and it looked as if it was over. You made our way. Understanding it only because you made our way. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we are so thrilled, Lord, [Music] because you are God, not 2,000 years ago. Not a God to come, but a God that is here with us and in us revealed in us in this bright coming of Jesus Christ. Lord, may we receive that revelation of what you're doing in this house. Bring us closer to you, Lord. Closer to you, closer to you. Give us the desire, the hunger to feed more on the message that we may grow in the stage of Christ. Lord, this people, Father, love you. We don't want to confuse them. We want them to know you give them a hunger, more hunger that the more they eat of the Lord, the more they will know who you are and know who they are, we will know our true origin. And Lord, thereby we might be able to know the exploits which we can do and the authority which we will by the power of revelation. Bless each one of us father. Lord even as we give of our offerings Lord the tith bless every giver that those who will give with revelation Lord you grant unto them that which they desire. And I pray, oh God, that as we shall go to our homes tonight, you will let the Holy Spirit go with us. And may we go meditating on this word such as we have had tonight. Bless those that have been fellowshipping with us online. Be with them, Lord, and every desire that they have according to your word. We love you, Lord, and we bless your people now. And I pray that you would dismiss us with your love in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you saints. Give our offerings and then be dismissed. We'll be here again on Sunday morning at 10. God bless you. Brother Am please. Thanks to Calary, I am not the man that I used to be. Thanks to Calary, things are different from before.

Let us sing this song as you're moving out. [Music] Oh sh called by a heavy bail. I was near the Lord of guilt and shame. But there the hand of Jesus touch me. And now I'm no longer the s.
