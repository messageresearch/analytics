foreign [Music] I'd like to take this opportunity to greet you all in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen Amina I said what a gathering I'm just thinking about the Gathering in the air tonight [Music] we are just in the practice I'd like to appreciate Pastor Joseph and type for the for inviting us and also for pre uh preparing this these conventions I heard about that saying that this is not um uh evening evening light bright Tabernacle conventional I'd like also to bring uh greetings from Kenya Kenya um by God is Grace no it's such a cartoon I was in Kenya this uh the beginning actually when the conversion here was starting we were also starting the other side a he usually we usually have been participating in that confession over there around this time of the year so this time we were there apart and then we came here to also participate in this world so they sent in Kenya sent you greetings so we just arrived very early in the morning today at home after taking three meetings so you can imagine I might be wearing the body but I believe it's not me you're going to hear from but from the Lord so I would like to also check this opportunity to thank God for pastor Leo I did not know that he was the day manager today but I was honored that he invited me on the pulpit [Music] because he's my pastor [Music] amen Mina like he said we I've believed and preached this message for a little over 15 years but more than half of that time I was myself and my wife my young family were in Ethiopia but the first time we went to Ethiopia was for our honeymoon there was no established message church at the time you can say but I'm happy to see uh brother Zaid I think that's the right name the first person who welcomed me at the airport was a Zimbabwean brother and so we by God is Grace now there are two churches in Ethiopia in different cities the church which we you know pastored for uh for some years now is pastored by an Ethiopian brother and the other Church there is no pasta yet but there's a brother who is also helping and the Lord has been good amen Amina so uh like the pastor Leo said the Lord now I want it before we get into the world so you get to you know know me just a little bit so you don't get to figure me out you know before we get it so uh for for assist before I think just shortly before Coffee started he returned back to Uganda Uganda and the Lord sent us to the namongo area you know our sister you know believed miraculously you know um long story but I want to go into that and she believed the message and was at the time working in Ethiopia Ethiopia and so after we baptized and she invited us to come and minister to her people in some Congo area and I go to London there was no Fellowship so you really felt Baden to come and help and so we started the fellowship in our house I think a little about a year and a half ago and now I should say that the Lord has been good because now we have a congregation Gathering uh in namgongo area I expected several of them to be here if you're from Days of the voice Fellowship can you please stand up the voice all right I mean right there three girls and two boys and God has blessed me also with other children other boys that I uh my father I don't know where they are also conditions yes that is shame that is amen Amina praise the name of the Lord after being fathered by a priest in the Anglican Church [Music] um my mother also ministering in the to pretend there is a Revival they raised me to be a preacher of the Gospel and uh they raised me to be a preacher of the Gospel because they thought that I had a calling on my life so when I became 13 years old he went to live with the shape of the Anglican church and uh I I stepped on my Pulpit for my first time at 13 years old and ever since then I I have been preaching the the gospel foreign and that family friend happened to be a pastor in this message and so I want to live with them self and his wife and so we lived with them for some years but in the first six months and this is important to me because it's going to this is the background of the message I'm going to preach to you this morning [Music] I wanted to be a bishop in the Anglican Church that was my dreams I had the means because the bishop and the current at that time the Archbishop they had met with me and they had promised me to take me to uh to Maryland to start a Theology and you know I was used to living a life a luxurious life [Music] and you know eating good food sitting on high tables and Bishops and things but when the Lord moved me and put me in a little place that these people we are gathering were just about 10 or 15 and gathering in a very shanty house supposedly to be despised but the Lord had other plans for my life and they there's an a brother called by the poor and the past at that time they would start to preach to me and preach to me all the doctrines of the message but you see I try to run away from it could be do come but I couldn't run away because there was another Destiny other than the one I had envisioned for myself and so um long story short one day I would now be going to our church very early in the morning and because I live at a pastor's house I had to go to their church after our church they prayed for longer so those long prayers are very good because they helped me so then one day in our church as the woman who preacher was preaching and then after she preached then they told us to look I don't remember which direction and we started singing the Apostles Creed and as we were rehearsing it words that said and I believe in the Holy Catholic Church [Music] so I said to myself am I a Catholic I remember the words brother Paula told me that you are a Catholic and I told him no I'm angry which means I'm a Protestant but he said no you were catholic so when I heard those words I just knew that indeed I was a Catholic I was a part of the Roman system and then they started baptizing a baby there in the rear of the church and then it turned out that they started baptizing the baby using the water the holy water is the name of this and while the priest was the woman priest was still speaking at that time at that moment something happened that changed my entire Destiny I I had a wall I did not know it's called you know but when I I later believe the message I read you know and also in the Book of Job it's called a whirlwind [Music] like I was losing balance and a voice out of it spoke to me find the nearest exit and leave this place cause you are in the wrong place I tell you friends I heard that voice I had had the message for six months and I was determined to stay in my church but when I had that voice I was almost passing out I picked my Bible and just swung myself and then I had nowhere to go [Music] [Music] and those things really touched my heart and when the wall of wind came back [Music] this message is true and also asked to be baptized in the name of our Lord now that was not written in here but I had it and this is a true witness and at that moment those people who were there some of them I believe they are here they will also Testify the Lord at that moment you know they said both my hands but I raised that's why preachers I believe we should be patient with people when we are doing an articles [Music] I have I believe this message is the truth and I've decided to be baptized in the name of our Lord and uh people shouted on top of their voice [Music] in the name of our Lord Jesus and ever since that moment when I came out of the water I pledged my life [Music] and that's what I've come here to do just to testify the message is true foreign foreign [Music] and so this morning this afternoon I see I have about an hour or so I would like to speak to you on an encounter with God and for inspiration just something I feel to you know touch on is the gospel the message is a destiny change I wonder if we can stand on our feet foreign [Music] just take verses 39. Luke chapter 23 we'll just read verse 39-43 amen Amina and one of the male factors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be Christ save thyself and us but they are the answering rebuked him saying does not thou fear God seeing without in the same condemnation and we indeed and we indeed justly for we receive uh the due reward of our Deeds but this man has done nothing amiss and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou cometh into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto you today today shalt thou be with me in Paradise amen Brothers at the moment um [Music] [Music] Hallelujah Lord Jesus we have heard Lord the ministers ministers [Music] to show us that now the times of the Gentiles are not only numbered foreign [Music] [Music] an encounter with God for the message now here in my notes I put the gospel but as I was coming I thought inspired to say the message praise the name of the Lord now each of us no doubt at one time we have had an encounter [Music] and while we live in this Earth You are going to have an encounter okay if you don't have an encounter with God you are going to have an encounter with the devil [Music] and there are many people who would even sit in church pews and they do that week after week after weeks but you know it has come to a place where it has become a religion [Applause] foreign foreign [Applause] and I've asked many young people and I've asked them when did you believe the message and I will say yes from since I was a boy I was born in the message listen my brother if you are here oh my sister I wish I was born in the message this is nothing about your parents and that is foreign [Music] [Music] if your Christ service and save yourself hallelujah amen these feet these two thieves on the cross I know the picture we have them in our minds of them in their minds we thank God they were so bad but let me tell you they were representing us foreign [Music] listen we didn't destined to go to hell no I'm against and unless something happening there ought to be something that had to happen that's why the Bible says and prophets in the Book of Genesis and that's what Jesus was today people are celebrating Christmas you don't even know what it is because they don't understand this is about Jesus Christ foreign because in a message the tokens we are not to come together to talk about the message we have not come here to talk about it because we know what it is but we have come together we have because it says the message is Christ [Music] he is the living is the word that's right we are to get into it we have to get benefits that is foreign the seed of God cannot perish for sure you were born the stream for hell who was Daddy walking but because you are you were predestinated [Music] when you hear the message because you will fight now finally alive this has always been a part of you this is and I remember when I asked brother I said because that preached to me everything you're not but they are not talked about that man on the beach who is that one yeah okay man like he is [Music] the message is true hallelujah amen there are many people who are you trying to say why I left a message why I left a message you cannot leave the message because if you were predestinated the message is in you you cannot leave yourself because the message is Europe there is no other place hallelujah amen Peter and the rest of them they told Jesus life is in the message because the message is related [Music] laughs and here Jesus the Lord of all was on the cross and they hanged him they did not know he was later than they thought yeah and they asked him he would say they asked him he said the time for you to restore the kingdom [Music] but only that this was now a difference foreign [Music] Professor can be fulfilled right in your midst and you can miss it when you search the scriptures they say it tell us why what the scribes that Elijah will first come out because we have seen we have seen you when you were transfigured and when they saw Jesus Moses and they were all in that brightness [Music] that was Elijah because he had not died shall be together with him Christ so they receive the Revelation why did the writers foreign foreign [Music] in the past but they didn't want to see what was coming let me tell you people are like that in the in our generation you tell them God promised an Elijah and our generation but they will tell you oh it was John the baptism that it was John but there was a verse says he will not do the work of job you will do a new thing because he will restore he will restore he will not do the work John did necessary not new doctrines but the same same thing hallelujah amen if we are that in the same church that is something that happened in the Bible I'm sorry if you don't believe in me because I believe in miracles miracles must happen but we are not going to manufacture them we are going to believe the world and I challenge you if you're sickness you cannot walk away the way you came if you were a believer hello it doesn't have to be a song the word is [Applause] the Miracles not the minister the prophet man of God blah blah blah special man of God oh that is rubbish is all we need to produce what listen to a message some of us are only satisfied with our pastors and I thank God because now now if I I used to fear to talk like that before I became a pastor but even my people are here foreign hallelujah hallelujah of course our Ministries as pastors they have their place for child there is no special bastard a great Pastor a single person I fear that these titles are coming in the message plus famous names that's the wrong spirit [Applause] praise the name of the Lord why am I speaking that way watching to get away my heart is clean I have no objections from denominational barriers if only we can feed on it if we only we can put our hearts they say oh God I want more of you I don't want to be satisfied with this give me more [Applause] hallelujah amen I'm sorry I can't get sad I'm trying to get to the scripture but I can't and one of the male factors which were hanged and railed on him [Music] Jesus was on the cross yes and that was this [Music] [Music] it was later than he thought the minutes laughing at us because of what we believe when they will see that it is much later than they thought the Rapture would have happened don't get left behind America because if you're left behind you will become your own Pastor in your own church today [Music] sometimes even I say Lord I'm going to go and I'll preach slowly I find this fire let me tell you this message is may we leave this convention where do we have fired when preachers will go back to the streets and byways you find a lot of young men fighting but one and struggling to preach in the church foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but you find love is gone now your Sangha love is gone when the brother box right oh that's a very good thing for some of us when it comes he will be looked at someone who is satanic [Music] where is Grace he's come to put himself what were you thinking how many times did you do it makeup brother are you really ready and this Soul has come to every Fallen brother do we do that where is love will correct the area you are not going to tell him okay remain with your sins but you are going with love show them Grace and bring them back together because Christ The Gospel Christ the message is a destiny changer Crystal Angelina there was a woman one day in our church because her husband had secretly been baptized without Hanoi area and so he would always entice her to come to church he told me I want to have any issues with my marriage but I will keep bringing her and I told him yes brother have a problem whenever she comes she's wearing trousers foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] the message turn around your neighbor tell them the messages hallelujah amen Glory Glory Glory and so right away on the cross Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] with my people foreign Hallelujah Jesus said yes this statement for the first time in his entire life all of them of the Old Testament they were right there in Paradise but for the first time foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] now Hallelujah the Lord wants to make himself known to you there is no reason to remain in your seats [Applause] I want to be with Jesus and this man had something I don't know [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] and you still go to clubs you're going clubs it is [Music] foreign [Music] the word destiny again means what happens in the future the thing that someone or something will experience in the future a power a man that is believed to control what happens in the future this man is Destiny was changed hey just a moment in just a moment his destiny [Applause] foreign [Applause] I received my son and now not tomorrow I am happy that's why I believe as a heartbeat because the joy of the Lord is our strength something to be happy about [Music] Pentecostals but they have nothing to be happy we have something to be happy about foreign [Applause] languages [Music] [Applause] [Applause] numbers [Applause] We Believe thank you and then we shall be together [Applause] [Applause] let me tell you don't let the world have an encounter with God something will happen which will take you away from your attention that this is not just a teaching degree it's an experience things we are saying nowadays young ladies they are beginning almost to go naked but yes I mean in the message [Music] what is happening when you go on their weddings what happened and some of them they believe they don't use America they are nice sisters they will remove all their slopes the one where the pig was swimming foreign [Music] because they've done everything else because but I want to say also ninja Canada is another group and I believe I'm speaking to that experience which believe in an encounter with God if you have an encounter with God foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] why our pastor suffering because our people come around to us they think because they are not Pentecostals Pentecostals but for us we receive the word because we are not putting the word into God I thank God for this meeting let me tell you to some of you who did not know they're over a thousand believes these people make their own meetings they don't even get support from animals foreign foreign speaking today my generation we need to rise to the challenge we're taking this message foreign [Music] [Music] and if God blessed one rest because of it so much bless our results hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah that's the truth I think things like this ought to be spoken on a convention and shy away from them foreign so who is going to be the preacheria let me say this when I was in Kenya when when birthday Kenya I met a pastor 81 years and I asked him he is old so he can no longer preach I felt bad but her heart is a powerful preacher and he was preaching until two years ago he sits on a chair but he tells he told me you can only preach for 30 minutes I don't think it will be preaching I think it will be speaking that's the truth because it doesn't have the strength but here's what I want to say no I'm not saying that that is bad he is doing his he's fulfilling his quality but I asked him a question with respect I said pasta what is your plan for Success you know he said I have no plan I said you have no plan so who preaches now since you told me you would last speech two years ago and he has a big challenge he told me um we have some brothers who are preaching as I told him why don't you have a plan of success for him that's your number it is time and she said you know we younger people accept to take the challenge has no plan for succession I don't know if that's the right word why doesn't he have a plan maybe because when he looks around so he looks around and says foreign hey I've had several times I spoke to her and she said she's not ready I spoke to her and she said she's not into the things where are we going what generation let us have an encounter with God I believe young ladies [Applause] it is [Music] you that right but the word of God if you have an encounter with God he gives you
