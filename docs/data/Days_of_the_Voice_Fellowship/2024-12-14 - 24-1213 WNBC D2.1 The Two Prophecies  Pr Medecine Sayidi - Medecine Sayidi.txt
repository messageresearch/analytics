about the PA system I'm a village preacher amen amen we started preaching when there was no PA system don't worry about it I know the devil loves attention when music was going on it did not disturb but when the preaching comes that's why he T he knows what you are going to receive he knows what God is going to do for you by preaching of the word so the battle of Angels became the B of human being so even this morning the B of angels has become the ble of and Michael which is King theop Jesus Christ is on your side amen hallelujah hallelujah we not against flesh and black against rulers against principal Hallelujah and we are not conquerors we are more than conquerors he that is in US is greater than he that is in the world thank you Jesus Hallelujah huj so we realize here amen that

has got aching [Music] feet you the one that has got a stomach problem the devil hased it your own [Music] batt what you are feeling now you can't share it with somebody this is the proposition of the enemy come to you directly and say can you fight me amen am it is your marriage which is being fought it is your promotion is being f it is your is being for this is how the Devil comes down and reduces the battle one man so we are taking the philistin representing the devil he comes and saying give me a man give me a woman hallah hallelu Mar right that you live right that man or woman fight with him hallelujah hallelujah are ready this morning pick up a fight with the Hallelujah ready this morning to up a fight with the I tell you this morning I am [Music] [Applause] supercharged I can

count yes and the Philistines said unto David am I dog th comest to me with stars and the Philistine tased David by his Gods toid come me come to me and I'll give thy fles to the and die to the Beast of the F what was that prophecy amen amen when the devil increases like a flood of [Music] God when the Philistines saw David the Bible says heed him he was a young man handsome amen amen he was not
