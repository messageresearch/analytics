[0:24] welcome to Global answers please join us
[0:27] as we discuss the relevance of God's
[0:29] eternal word relating to events in this
[0:32] day and what it means to you and now
[0:36] your host Lonnie Jenkins Hello friends
[0:39] I'm Lonnie delighted to be back with you
[0:41] again uh we were in a session last week
[0:44] and we want to continue on with our
[0:46] subject matter I hope you were with us
[0:48] uh last week and can stay with us
[0:51] through this one here we have spoken to
[0:53] you many times about the ministry of
[0:56] William brandham and a last day Prophet
[0:58] an end time prophet
[1:00] and uh we have with us uh brother Ed
[1:02] bcll he's a minister up in Canada and uh
[1:07] I don't know how to say it without I
[1:10] don't want to make him feel special or
[1:11] embarrassed but he had he had an
[1:14] opportunity to spend a lot of time with
[1:16] this man William brandham who was a
[1:18] prophet of God whose life fulfilled
[1:20] scripture and he's been a worldwide
[1:22] witness and this ministry that we talk
[1:25] about is not just coming to you over uh
[1:28] Television over your satellite
[1:30] connection this ministry is around the
[1:32] world the one that we're talking about
[1:34] and so it's not hidden in a corner his
[1:36] church is up in Canada there's hundreds
[1:38] of churches across the United States in
[1:40] Russia uh we have in the studio here
[1:42] some one of the ministers from Pakistan
[1:44] and another one from Canada over here
[1:46] it's not done in a corner so this
[1:49] wonderful Ministry that we talk about
[1:51] God has sent again the spirit of Elijah
[1:53] on a mighty Prophet to restore us back
[1:56] to the gospel that Paul preached to lift
[1:58] us out of the tradition that have crept
[2:00] in I'll say something I don't want to
[2:02] hurt our Jewish friends but the very
[2:04] same thing that happened to them
[2:06] happened happened in the Gentile church
[2:08] and that God presented a pure word to
[2:10] them and we could go through what had
[2:13] happened but anyway they got taken away
[2:15] from the pure word of Moses of into
[2:17] other books that were trans supposedly
[2:20] interpreting this word but actually took
[2:23] the people away from this word and
[2:26] diverted them away same thing has
[2:28] happened with the Christians and the
[2:29] Bible
[2:31] what God gave to us as Christians what
[2:33] gave to God to the gave to the Christian
[2:35] Community it got taken away taken in a
[2:39] different direction sometimes we find
[2:41] that Christian leaders uh take them in
[2:44] another way for their own benefit
[2:45] sometimes we find politically minded men
[2:48] find that religion is a good Avenue and
[2:51] they can take religion and twist it to
[2:54] their purposes and we see it actually
[2:55] happening all over the world today this
[2:57] this very thing that is not the pure
[3:00] word that it was but it's been Twisted
[3:02] for some political purpose but
[3:05] nevertheless God before this great
[3:08] Judgment of God that's promised on the
[3:09] earth in the near future came God had
[3:12] promised that a man with the spirit of
[3:14] Elijah would come and take us back to
[3:16] the gospel that Paul preached and the
[3:19] man that we have in the studio today
[3:20] Reverend Ed bisc has spent time with
[3:23] this prophet and so we're wanting to
[3:25] pull from him what he saw about this
[3:28] ministry what happened through this man
[3:32] that would be so different that he could
[3:34] say this man was special this man was
[3:36] different and then we were asking him
[3:38] last time uh to give us some examples of
[3:41] what he saw in this ministry and today
[3:44] we'd like to take the time to
[3:46] possibly place this ministry a little
[3:49] more in scripture i g I gave you the
[3:51] comparisons last time of the Elijah
[3:54] Ministry to John and the Elijah Ministry
[3:57] in this day how that John came to preach
[3:59] prepare the way of the Lord under the
[4:01] spirit of Elijah and the spirit of
[4:03] Elijah in this day came to restore take
[4:05] us back to the gospel Paul preached but
[4:08] there's there's more to this and because
[4:10] we have a
[4:12] eyewitness one who was there with the
[4:14] prophet and spoke to him personally
[4:16] about some of these doctrines we'd like
[4:18] to move the camera over now to brother
[4:21] bcll and brother Ed if you would share
[4:23] with us a little bit about some of the
[4:24] things we've been talking about take us
[4:26] anywhere you want in scripture just feel
[4:28] free thank you brother Lonnie
[4:30] I think that you have touched on perhaps
[4:33] one of the
[4:35] major uh
[4:37] subjects by saying a forerunner MH a
[4:41] question which was in my mind and this
[4:43] was as a young Minister I I wondered why
[4:46] did God need to have the spirit of
[4:49] Elijah on one called John the Baptist to
[4:52] forerun the coming of Jesus Christ uh
[4:56] wasn't the ministry of Jesus Christ
[4:58] sufficient in itself why the Forerunner
[5:01] to prepare the way of the Lord and I
[5:04] believe last week you spoke on the
[5:06] difference between preparation and
[5:09] restoration and uh John came to prepare
[5:13] the way of the Lord God for reasons
[5:17] known only to himself chose the faithful
[5:21] Spirit of Elijah to forun the coming of
[5:25] Jesus Christ now for all of our viewers
[5:29] I know that each one that has any
[5:34] understanding of Salvation and of of of
[5:38] Christianity they are looking for Jesus
[5:41] to return but we don't even have we
[5:44] don't have a right to expect him unless
[5:48] we can identify as the scripture says
[5:51] very clearly there will be a voice to
[5:54] forun him and if I could like I I would
[5:57] like to take two or three places if I
[5:59] may take that Liberty in the
[6:02] scripture Jesus himself told us in
[6:05] Matthew the 25th chapter that there
[6:08] would be a a a voice or a cry at
[6:12] midnight that the Kingdom of Heaven
[6:14] would be likened unto 10 virgins uh five
[6:17] were wise and five were foolish but the
[6:20] Bible says and at midnight there was a
[6:23] cry made behold the bridegroom cometh
[6:27] without taking too much time it's
[6:31] absolutely it's clear crystal clear that
[6:35] there was a cry at midnight prior to the
[6:39] bridegroom arriving on the scene and
[6:43] then I believe last week you made
[6:44] reference to Malachi 4 5 and 6 but I
[6:49] would like to just compare it also with
[6:51] another scripture okay behold I will
[6:54] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[6:57] coming of the Great
[7:00] and Dreadful day of the Lord when
[7:02] William brandham was speaking with me on
[7:04] this scripture he said the the coming
[7:07] the first coming of Christ was great but
[7:11] it was not Dreadful and the spirit of
[7:14] Elijah comes before the Great and the
[7:18] Dreadful day of the Lord right now when
[7:21] the angel came to
[7:23] Zacharias the father of John the Baptist
[7:27] right he said these words
[7:30] and he shall go before him that is
[7:32] Christ in the spirit and power of Elias
[7:36] which is Elijah to turn the hearts of
[7:39] the fathers to the children the angel
[7:43] himself breaks the scripture in Malachi
[7:47] right in half he will turn the hearts of
[7:50] the fathers to the children the fathers
[7:53] of the law to the children and he breaks
[7:56] the scripture in half and says nothing
[7:59] of the children being restored back to
[8:02] the faith of the fathers because that
[8:05] was going to take place before the
[8:07] Dreadful day or the Dreadful coming and
[8:12] now we are to expect from that a voice
[8:16] to come to turn the hearts of the
[8:19] children back to the fathers or we could
[8:22] say a cry at midnight those are two
[8:25] places in the
[8:26] scripture and then the third place that
[8:29] I would like to refer to would be in
[8:31] Thessalonians and it's a scripture that
[8:34] is certainly one of our favorites for
[8:37] all people who are looking for Jesus to
[8:40] come says it says for this we say unto
[8:44] you by the word of the Lord that we
[8:47] which are alive and remain unto the
[8:50] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[8:52] them which are asleep for the Lord
[8:55] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[8:58] shout
[8:59] with the voice of the Archangel and with
[9:02] the Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[9:05] shall rise first and we realize also uh
[9:08] brother Lonnie that the last Church age
[9:12] in Revelation chapters 1 2 and 3 in
[9:16] chapter
[9:17] three I will send you a voice he says in
[9:22] chapter three that the message to the
[9:26] leodan church it's a very Str message
[9:30] but it concludes by saying behold I
[9:34] stand at the door and knock mhm so even
[9:38] even just prior to the uh Awakening of
[9:44] the of the end time church that I
[9:47] personal pronoun Jesus Christ standing
[9:50] at the door knock the
[9:52] messenger of Revelation 3:14-15 must
[9:57] come and deliver his message to the chur
[9:59] Church age at that time let me interject
[10:02] here just a minute for our viewing
[10:03] audience I want to just mention
[10:05] something to you in Revelations chapter
[10:06] 2 and three we have seven churches of
[10:09] Asia Gentile churches Gentile churches
[10:12] we've mentioned these things to you but
[10:14] we have new people watching all the time
[10:15] so I want to be sure you understand so
[10:18] Revelations chapter 2 chapter 3 under
[10:20] the angel of the Church of Ephesus then
[10:22] Smyrna pergamus thot Sardis Philadelphia
[10:24] and leod deia and they were literal
[10:27] churches at that time but we find that
[10:30] we can take the condition of those
[10:32] churches and just virtually lay them
[10:34] over history and we find that they there
[10:37] what was said to the each church was
[10:40] actually prophetic of an age to come and
[10:44] if we as soon as we match it through
[10:45] historically and we'll go through this
[10:47] in detail with you one of these days but
[10:49] right now we're just jumping now as he
[10:51] mentioned Leo deia the seventh or last
[10:54] church that's our age this is the leodan
[10:57] age and you'll find that God too Le oia
[11:00] has nothing good to say he in the other
[11:03] churches he tells them what they're
[11:04] right and where they're wrong but in
[11:06] this age he has nothing good to say to
[11:09] to our final age that's why God had to
[11:11] send Elijah lest I smite the Earth with
[11:14] a curse because the the whole system was
[11:17] going in such a direction that there was
[11:20] no hope without this restoration
[11:23] Ministry now back to brother
[11:26] Ed I think the
[11:29] the the
[11:31] scripture that opened up uh for
[11:34] myself is is when I found or discovered
[11:39] that there had to be it was absolutely
[11:43] essential to have a not a voice just to
[11:47] tell us that the Lord is coming that we
[11:48] knew right but when we were so aware and
[11:53] I was so aware and many of my associates
[11:56] and colleagues were so aware that there
[11:58] was a the
[12:00] decline of spiritual uh of the spiritual
[12:05] temperature the level of spiritual life
[12:08] in the people and as hard as we would
[12:11] Minister as fervently as we would
[12:13] Minister it seemed that we were
[12:16] powerless to sustain the spiritual level
[12:20] and the spiritual
[12:21] atmosphere but when I became aware that
[12:25] God had sent a prophet and the word of
[12:28] God comes to the prophet and comes from
[12:30] his mouth brother Lonnie there was a
[12:33] multitude of not just questions answered
[12:36] but then this Bible this Bible literally
[12:40] became an open book amen and uh mystery
[12:44] after mystery and scripture after
[12:46] scripture and especially concerning the
[12:48] coming of the Lord it all begin to fall
[12:51] into place for example we used to
[12:54] believe as most do well the Lord will
[12:56] come in a twinkling of an eye and the
[12:58] dead are going to come out of the graves
[13:00] and and everything's going to happen in
[13:02] just uh in a twinkling of an eye but
[13:04] then you have a Prophet come and takes
[13:07] the scripture says the dead in Christ
[13:10] shall rise first period M then we which
[13:13] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[13:16] together with them MH and such simple
[13:20] statements but then it began to put our
[13:24] day and our expectation and the things
[13:27] which God has left
[13:30] laid in the scripture for us but now
[13:33] they were being made clear MH uh and it
[13:38] it it was simply the mouth that it was
[13:41] coming from that made it so clear to
[13:44] myself and I don't know if your viewers
[13:47] are aware brother Lonnie but of brother
[13:49] bram's Ministry there was over
[13:53] 1,100 of his messages and the absolute
[13:57] proof of the prophetic Ministry
[13:59] has been recorded and and kept for us
[14:02] and we're so happy for that MH uh
[14:05] viewing Audience by the way while he
[14:06] mentions that if you want to contact us
[14:09] on global answers at our website and
[14:12] just re request one of those tapes say I
[14:15] would like to hear a healing line from
[14:17] William brander and see this hear this
[14:20] prophet in action write to us we'll
[14:21] we'll send it to you no charge go ahead
[14:24] for all right uh another another
[14:27] scripture which I think is uh very
[14:29] significant and for the viewers in
[14:35] in Isaiah 61 Isaiah prophesied and Jesus
[14:39] referred to this
[14:40] prophecy for the spirit of the spirit of
[14:43] the Lord God is upon me because the Lord
[14:45] hath anointed me to preach Good
[14:49] Tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to
[14:53] bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim
[14:55] Liberty to the captives and opening of
[14:58] the prison to them that are bound notice
[15:01] now this second verse Isaiah 61
[15:04] and2 to proclaim the acceptable year of
[15:07] the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our
[15:11] God to comfort all that mourn notice the
[15:16] year of to proclaim the acceptable year
[15:19] of the Lord number one number two the
[15:23] day of Vengeance of our God when Jesus
[15:25] entered into the temple in Luke the 4th
[15:28] chapter
[15:29] and there began to quote this prophecy
[15:34] and he said of himself and there was
[15:37] delivered unto him the book of Isaiah
[15:40] the prophet and when he opened the book
[15:43] he found the place he was looking
[15:45] brother Lonnie for this exact spot so
[15:49] that's very precise where it was written
[15:52] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[15:53] because he hath anointed me to preach
[15:55] the gospel to the poor he hath sent me
[15:59] to heal the
[16:00] brokenhearted to preach the Deliverance
[16:03] to captives and recovering of sight to
[16:06] the blind to set Liberty them that are
[16:08] bruised now he goes on to verse two but
[16:11] he cuts the verse in half to preach the
[16:15] acceptable year of the Lord and he
[16:17] closed the book that was a very
[16:19] deliberate
[16:21] act and to preach the acceptable year of
[16:23] the Lord and he closed the book because
[16:26] that coming was not the day of Vengeance
[16:30] MH right and
[16:32] so John had just foran Christ M he had
[16:37] just foran the acceptable year and now
[16:40] Elijah must indeed come and has come to
[16:45] forun the day of Vengeance of our
[16:48] God I will just conclude my little part
[16:51] of this brother Lonnie by saying I often
[16:55] asked what would I do if I were God what
[17:00] would I do to
[17:02] warn a world of the coming of Christ and
[17:06] the Judgment what would I do and I think
[17:10] the pattern that I would do would be
[17:15] exactly what he did at the first coming
[17:17] sends Elijah introduces Jesus Christ
[17:21] Jesus Christ delivers his message does
[17:23] his mighty works and the whole work is
[17:25] concluded in the end time there's a
[17:28] repeat of exactly the same the same
[17:31] performance here it comes Elijah out of
[17:34] the Wilderness as it were out of
[17:36] obscurity and William brandham with a
[17:38] mighty Earth shaking India Bombay with
[17:42] hundreds of thousands of people Durban
[17:44] South Africa uh Cape Town Johannesburg
[17:48] All Over America Germany Switzerland the
[17:51] Scandinavian countries and this ministry
[17:54] the dead raised five certificates of
[17:57] five people been raised raised from the
[17:59] dead it was so phenomenal and then God
[18:03] would use his mouth to deliver a message
[18:06] to this age just prior to the appearing
[18:11] of Christ and taking his elected bride
[18:15] out from this inner Rapture and a change
[18:18] of this body it only
[18:21] seems precisely correct to me that God
[18:25] would do the same thing he did at the
[18:27] first coming at this at this time of the
[18:30] second coming God being a god of
[18:32] perfection he can't prove on improve on
[18:35] his methods once he uses a set way he
[18:39] always uh moves in the same way so that
[18:41] we can see see what he's doing see what
[18:43] he's trying to bring to pass I'd like to
[18:46] back up just a little bit in my personal
[18:48] testimony regarding this ministry I
[18:50] became aware that God had sent a prophet
[18:52] in uh in about May of
[18:56] 1966 and uh shortly thereafter after I
[19:00] spent many months just buried listening
[19:02] to those tapes to find out what did God
[19:04] have to say to this generation through
[19:07] that profet and as I began to get
[19:09] something under my belt I was I was kind
[19:12] of one foot in Pentecost one foot in the
[19:14] charismatic move at that time and I made
[19:17] many contacts so I started moving around
[19:19] among my friends in these various
[19:21] churches wanting to share with them what
[19:24] God had done in this in this
[19:27] generation and and I found that through
[19:29] the 60s when I was going around that to
[19:33] just describe the kind of ministry that
[19:35] William brandham had was just
[19:37] earthshaking to the people they wanted
[19:39] to know more about this because of the
[19:42] supernatural but by the time we got into
[19:45] the 70s and I would begin to speak to
[19:47] the people about this Supernatural
[19:50] Ministry by now they're saying oh yeah
[19:52] brother so and so does that and brother
[19:54] so and so does that and the whole area
[19:57] was becoming clouded now because other
[20:00] anointed men were Rising with what the
[20:03] people thought were similar similar
[20:06] Ministries but as brother bcll mentioned
[20:09] in the previous thing but no one with
[20:12] the accuracy the Perfection that this
[20:15] first first one uh uh could dis display
[20:19] of God now let me just back up when
[20:23] Moses came on the on the scene as God's
[20:25] Prophet to an age he had a message
[20:28] message from the people of from God to
[20:31] the to the people of God and but then to
[20:34] confuse the issue the court magicians
[20:37] Janice and jambre began to duplicate
[20:41] what Moses was doing and then so much of
[20:43] the supernatural that Moses did Janus
[20:45] and jambre duplicated and it kind of
[20:48] confused the issue hardened the heart of
[20:50] pharaoh because hey my boys can do that
[20:52] too but then but we if we go back and
[20:55] examine it though but only Moses had a
[20:58] message from God and Moses did it first
[21:02] and then the copers came along and then
[21:05] now we find in in the circles where
[21:07] these anointed men are operating and
[21:10] supposedly performing all the Miracles
[21:12] of God and much of it is much of it is
[21:15] wouldn't deny it a bit we talked about
[21:17] the rain falling on the just and the
[21:19] unjust pour out of my spirit upon All
[21:22] Flesh so it's it's holy ghost power no
[21:24] doubt about it but do they have a
[21:26] message from God no they're trying to
[21:28] promote their own Ministry draw people
[21:30] to themselves not Point people to Christ
[21:33] where this ministry that we're speaking
[21:36] about didn't come to exalt himself he
[21:38] came to point us to the scriptures to
[21:40] take us back back to the gospel Paul
[21:42] preached to take us back to an unveiling
[21:45] of Jesus Christ as the people had lost
[21:48] sight of that and God did this
[21:51] Supernatural to draw our attention to
[21:53] where this that he was with this Mighty
[21:57] voice and this Ministry of the last age
[22:00] is calling out a people and as uh
[22:03] brother Ed just mentioned a moment ago
[22:04] about the
[22:06] Rapture it comes in three stages the
[22:08] shout and the voice and the Trump and
[22:11] until I understood from a prophet I
[22:14] always thought it was shout voice Trump
[22:16] bang we're gone and it was like all
[22:18] happened in 24 hours but we find that
[22:20] each one is a sequence one leading to
[22:23] the other one leading to the other and
[22:25] that shout is this very message we're
[22:28] talking about the shout before the
[22:32] second coming of the lord The Rapture
[22:34] friends is already in progress not the
[22:38] not to step into another dimension but
[22:41] the three-step process of the Rapture a
[22:44] shout a voice of the Archangel and a
[22:47] trump of God so the shout this message
[22:50] sweeping around the world to gather
[22:53] those who have ears to hear back to the
[22:56] word of God faith comes by hearing
[22:59] hearing by the word God had to bring a
[23:01] pure word to restore a pure Faith to
[23:05] accomplish in a people what's not been
[23:07] accomplished in any other age Faith to
[23:09] be changed in a moment in a twinkling of
[23:12] an eye and that too friends is a mystery
[23:14] in that the change in the moment in the
[23:17] twinkling of eye is the rapture it isn't
[23:21] that we're going to fly away into heaven
[23:23] in these bodies for something to happen
[23:26] when we are changed in a moment we are
[23:28] thrown in contact with the dimension
[23:31] that is right here near us but just
[23:33] faster and we can't see it so the shout
[23:36] is Gathering of people to prepare them
[23:39] for this theologically called Rapture or
[23:42] rapose or caught away like in the hands
[23:44] of an eagle caught away and then then
[23:47] the the voice of the Archangel brings on
[23:49] this resurrection that we've talked
[23:51] about the dead and dead in Christ this
[23:54] is not the general Resurrection those
[23:56] who were in Christ through the age ages
[23:59] will resurrect at the at the voice of
[24:01] the Archangel and then just as the
[24:04] parallel in Matthew 27 where the dead in
[24:07] Christ arose at the crucifixion of
[24:09] Christ and were seen by many for a
[24:11] period of time before they went with
[24:14] Christ in departing to another dimension
[24:17] the very same thing will happen in this
[24:19] age there'll be a period of time dead in
[24:21] Christ will rise they will be seen by
[24:23] many not all neither were they seen by
[24:26] many in Matthew 27 and then there will
[24:28] be that period of time and then this
[24:31] change in the body just prior to
[24:34] that there's going to be a tremendous
[24:36] persecution come on the Christians it's
[24:38] clear from scripture it's clear from a
[24:41] message that a prophet brought and part
[24:43] of the reason we're on the air we want
[24:45] to show you what's coming where it's
[24:48] coming from and what to do to be ready
[24:51] to face what's coming preparing your
[24:54] heart preparing your
[24:56] soul had to get that off my heart
[24:58] brother Ed you got any more comments for
[24:59] the people well I think you've touched
[25:01] on probably one of the most exciting
[25:03] aspects of of of this message and that
[25:06] is brother brandham compared the
[25:09] resurrection that is we are now in
[25:12] expectation of to the resurrection when
[25:15] Jesus first arose for he was the first
[25:17] fruits of the Resurrection but the
[25:21] scripture says and many were seen in the
[25:24] streets of Jerusalem but who saw them
[25:26] not Caiaphas not Herod not the high
[25:28] priests not the leaders not the Levites
[25:31] but they were seen to some Believers and
[25:35] they were assembled and the scripture
[25:37] says he was seen of above 500 Brethren M
[25:41] after his resurrection and before his
[25:43] Ascension and we're expecting to see
[25:45] that Resurrection happen on the same
[25:47] pattern it'll be
[25:49] glorious to face the music about us
[25:52] humans here was 500 that he was seen of
[25:55] after his resurrection but only 150 made
[25:58] it into the upper room amazing we humans
[26:01] are a sad lot we are we are dumb sheep
[26:04] the scripture says and we desperately
[26:07] need a shepherd and the only great
[26:09] Shepherd that can take us through is
[26:10] Jesus Christ and he is the Living Word
[26:13] now let me get in just a little more
[26:15] before we close Jesus said he is the I
[26:19] am he testified to that that's the same
[26:22] thing that God called himself in the Old
[26:24] Testament the I am what does that mean
[26:26] he means he's the present tense God and
[26:30] so most of Christianity is fervently
[26:33] studying what he was in the past
[26:36] prophesying no not prophesying
[26:38] predicting what he will be doing in the
[26:40] future and totally missing what he's
[26:43] doing today this broadcast is coming to
[26:46] you to try to show you what God is doing
[26:49] today so that you can be a part of it
