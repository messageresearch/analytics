[44:58] have you this evening
[44:59] amen uh this evening I want us to I want
[45:03] to talk about
[45:05] athle but this time not in the world as
[45:08] uh the perspective of the world but in
[45:13] Christianity blessed be the name of the
[45:15] Lord and if you look at where we have
[45:17] read Apostle Paul is referring
[45:20] us with the athletes people who are
[45:24] running in the race blessed be the name
[45:27] of the
[45:28] Lord but Bram preached the message he
[45:30] called the greatest battle ever
[45:33] fought and also if you read that message
[45:36] and the contest they have something
[45:40] similar and
[45:42] uh the same if you look at the scripture
[45:45] and all of us this is something which
[45:47] all of us
[45:49] know like when you're going to run a
[45:52] race you don't just start from the blue
[45:55] blessed be the name of the Lord
[45:57] but there is you spend some good time
[46:02] amen because it is like a a
[46:06] competition you
[46:09] find uh like I remember when we still
[46:12] like in primary school and high school
[46:16] we are given streams or you call them
[46:19] colors the blue colors the red colors
[46:22] the green colors or the lion or the
[46:25] cheatah something of that kind
[46:28] and you'll find that uh before the day
[46:31] of the final
[46:32] competition you will have to do some
[46:35] training blessed be the name of the
[46:38] Lord and here in this scripture we are
[46:40] seeing Apostle Paul telling us that
[46:42] wherefor seeing that we are we are also
[46:46] seeing that seeing we also are compassed
[46:51] about with great cloud of
[46:53] witness let us lay aside
[46:57] every
[47:00] weight and the sin which do is do so
[47:04] easily beset us
[47:07] amen you have to first the rehearsal you
[47:10] are doing or the rehearsal we are doing
[47:13] is laying aside the weight and the sin
[47:17] amen because we are surrounded by the
[47:20] great cloud of
[47:23] witnesses and we are looking at the
[47:25] positive Witnesses
[47:27] those who made it amen those are the
[47:30] positive examples We are following and
[47:33] we are looking at and we are having the
[47:36] disciples we are reading of the prophets
[47:39] blessed be the name of the Lord and
[47:41] that's why the Bible is telling us that
[47:42] seeing that we are all so
[47:45] compassed about with so great cloud of
[47:48] witness let us lay aside every weight
[47:52] and the sin which do easily beset us and
[47:56] let let us run with patience blessed be
[48:00] the name of the Lord do you know that we
[48:03] are in the
[48:06] rest brother Solomon do you know that
[48:09] you're running the race
[48:11] tonight amen the day you decided or the
[48:16] day you accepted Jesus Christ as your
[48:18] personal savior you entered in this
[48:22] race blessed be the name of the Lord and
[48:25] we are going to run this race until the
[48:28] final day but this race has the rules
[48:33] and the regulations blessed be the name
[48:35] of the Lord this race has something to
[48:38] do with training the race you're running
[48:41] has something to do with fasting amen
[48:44] reading the word listening to the
[48:46] message blessed be the name of the Lord
[48:48] attending Fellowship praying every
[48:51] day blessed be the name of the Lord
[48:55] those are the things accompaning the
[48:57] race we are
[48:58] running and I'm here to tell you if you
[49:01] are not aware that you are God's
[49:05] athletic elected by God
[49:09] himself blessed be the name of the Lord
[49:12] amen God knows our
[49:16] weakness he knows how little we are he
[49:20] knows how insufficient we are he knows
[49:24] all about you and me blessed be the the
[49:26] name of the
[49:28] Lord but regardless of our wickedness
[49:31] still he shows you because God knows
[49:35] that inside you you have that potential
[49:38] and that potential is put there by God
[49:41] himself blessed be the name of the Lord
[49:44] but most time the Devil comes and scares
[49:48] you he comes and challenges you and
[49:50] tells you cannot make it you look at
[49:52] yourself with all these things in the
[49:54] world you cannot be sa you cannot be
[49:56] born again you cannot be a serious
[49:58] believer but I'm here to tell you you
[50:03] can be a real
[50:05] believer amen you can be a real
[50:09] Saint blessed be the name of the Lord
[50:12] and I'm seeing Saint seated
[50:15] here blessed be the name of the Lord
[50:18] amen we are here to challenge the
[50:20] negative
[50:22] voice because we know most time the
[50:25] Devil Comes and start preaching his
[50:27] gospel to you just look at
[50:38] yourself and the moment you listen and
[50:41] you compromise brother you'll be
[50:45] disqualified blessed be the name of the
[50:47] Lord but the Bible tells us let us lay
[50:50] aside every weight amen you know sin is
[50:54] heavy and righteous is so
[50:58] light
[51:00] amen because Jesus said in Matthew 11:
[51:04] 28 come unto me all those who are y with
[51:07] heavy laden and I will give you rest he
[51:10] says take of me for my yoke is
[51:14] light the devil's yoke is heavy amen but
[51:18] Jesus yoke is
[51:21] light why because Jesus carries his yoke
[51:25] with you
[51:27] but the devil leaves it to you
[51:30] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[51:33] looking unto Jesus who is the author and
[51:36] the finisher of our faith who for the
[51:39] joy that was set before him he endureed
[51:42] the cross do you know that
[51:46] Jesus had all means of escaping the
[51:51] cross praise be to God
[51:59] because remember Jesus was God in flesh
[52:02] God was dwelling in that Temple and that
[52:05] Temple is the same Temple you are in and
[52:08] I'm in this Temple has its own desire
[52:12] that's why the prophet tells us that
[52:14] even Jesus was tempted even with sexual
[52:19] Temptation blessed be the name of the
[52:21] Lord
[52:27] that was the body praise be to God and
[52:31] here the Bible tells us
[52:36] yes he despised these other things the
[52:40] cross most time Believers we don't want
[52:43] to endure the cross praise be to God we
[52:47] sing I have decided to follow Jesus but
[52:50] we don't want to endure the cross but
[52:52] Jesus tells us to take our cross each
[52:56] one of you have a cross I have mine you
[53:00] have yours blessed be the name of the
[53:02] Lord and we must carry this cross praise
[53:05] be to
[53:07] God
[53:09] Amen looking at Jesus the author and the
[53:12] finisher of our
[53:14] faith who for the joy that was set
[53:17] before him endured the cross despising
[53:21] the
[53:22] shame and is sat down at the right hand
[53:26] of the Throne of
[53:27] God after he despised the shame he seed
[53:32] down on the right hand of the Throne of
[53:34] God blessed be the name of the Lord so
[53:37] each one of us we are learning the
[53:41] race and the Bible tells us to lay aside
[53:45] every weight because we cannot run with
[53:48] them weight we always say that in
[53:51] Christianity if you think that you are
[53:53] cheating us you are cheating yourself
[53:57] sometime we play church and you think
[54:00] you are helping the ministers you're
[54:02] helping your husband your wife your
[54:04] brother your mother your father brother
[54:07] you are helping yourself
[54:09] amen this is the paper which you cannot
[54:14] copy blessed be the name of the Lord the
[54:18] kind of exams we are sitting or we are
[54:20] doing your neighbors cannot copy your
[54:23] answer
[54:34] praise be to
[54:35] God each one of us we are
[54:40] running in different Lanes I cannot run
[54:44] on brother Wang's Lane neither Brother W
[54:46] cannot run on my Lane but
[54:53] sometime and there you're going to be
[54:55] disqualified
[54:56] because the race you're running it has
[55:00] the laws governing it blessed be the
[55:03] name of the
[55:07] Lord praise be to God but remember what
[55:11] we should not
[55:19] forget the rule of the game praise be to
[55:23] God Amen there is no shortcut to
[55:30] heaven the way to heaven is through New
[55:34] Birth you cannot bypass that and God
[55:37] made it so clear that even your father
[55:39] cannot give it to you you have to
[55:42] approach God
[55:44] Alone blessed be the name of the Lord so
[55:47] sometime you may think that you're
[55:49] playing Church you are playing yourself
[55:52] because even me cannot give it to you
[55:55] you have to go to God you have to follow
[55:58] the same same procedures amen for you to
[56:02] receive that blessed be the name of the
[56:04] Lord amen and here the Bible tells us
[56:08] let you are not running alone for your
[56:12] information let us
[56:14] run let us lay
[56:17] aside praise be to
[56:23] God
[56:25] Amen apost Paul in Romans chap 16: 25
[56:28] says that now to him that is of power to
[56:32] establish you according to my gospel
[56:37] amen you can only be established
[56:40] according to this
[56:42] gospel praise be to
[56:45] God and the preaching of Jesus
[56:52] Christ the only we can be established in
[56:55] Christianity is is according to the word
[56:57] of God not other things we are trying to
[57:00] do praise be to God and the
[57:04] preaching of Jesus Christ according to
[57:07] the revelation of the
[57:10] mystery which was kept sacred since the
[57:13] world began amen and we know that the
[57:17] Mysteries are revealed the secret which
[57:20] apostle Paul is talking about now you
[57:22] know them but what have you done
[57:28] blessed be the name of the
[57:30] Lord
[57:36] amen it says in Galatians 1:2 that for I
[57:41] neither receive it of man neither was I
[57:44] taught it but by the revelation of Jesus
[57:50] Christ the first thing after the you see
[57:53] here in the in the message adoption this
[57:55] adop
[57:56] part three the first thing after the son
[58:00] was was in he became a son but then we
[58:04] find out his behavior is what set him to
[58:09] to adoption whether he behaved right or
[58:13] not blessed be the name of the Lord
[58:18] amen because remember the Bible tells us
[58:21] in Ephesians chapter 1: 5 that having
[58:24] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[58:29] children by Jesus Christ to
[58:33] himself blessed be the name of the
[58:36] Lord so my brothers my sisters I don't
[58:39] have a lot
[58:41] tonight but we have to be
[58:45] conscious we have we must
[58:48] know this goes to everyone and if you're
[58:51] doing brother I'm going to call you and
[58:52] you stand in front
[58:55] here blessed be the name of the Lord you
[58:58] cannot run when you are dozing can you
[59:02] you
[59:09] can't they will always look for people
[59:11] who are
[59:14] healthy says that a true
[59:21] Christian
[59:23] because blessed be the name of the Lord
[59:26] but we are having kind of
[59:39] Christians praise be to God that's
[59:46] why but if you look at in
[59:50] athletics they will look for best
[59:53] Runners number one
[59:56] they will check your
[1:00:00] health and God being a being the master
[1:00:05] of perfection or being
[1:00:08] perfectionist that is the same that we
[1:00:10] are not called today but before the
[1:00:13] foundation of the world God prepared us
[1:00:15] for this
[1:00:17] day amen
[1:00:30] they want to win the prize and Apostle
[1:00:33] Paul tells us that we are not running in
[1:00:36] vain
[1:00:38] amen there is a reward waiting for us
[1:00:42] there is a price there is a trophy
[1:00:45] amen praise be to
[1:00:49] God so we must know number one why we
[1:00:52] are running
[1:00:59] I think it
[1:01:06] happens starting line
[1:01:09] [Music]
[1:01:37] but give it
[1:01:40] time blessed be the name of the
[1:01:44] Lord even if you look back in our life
[1:01:48] there are those people whom we started
[1:01:50] with and today they are nowhere to be
[1:01:54] seen others are always
[1:01:58] bus others are doing this and that in
[1:02:01] the world Amen and when you looked at
[1:02:04] them that day that time they were much
[1:02:08] much better than you but what is keeping
[1:02:11] you
[1:02:12] going praise be to God it is because you
[1:02:16] are following the rule of the
[1:02:20] game
[1:02:22] amen that's why the bible say that the
[1:02:25] rest is not for the
[1:02:28] sft blessed be the name of the Lord are
[1:02:32] you running with a
[1:02:35] vision are you running with a
[1:02:38] cause are you following Christ with a
[1:02:41] cause with our
[1:02:43] purpose
[1:02:44] amen or you are just coming for for for
[1:02:48] formality blessed be the name of the
[1:02:52] Lord that's why even Jesus time came
[1:02:57] and he had to engage another gear and
[1:03:00] told them unless you eat my
[1:03:03] flesh he looked at the congregation and
[1:03:06] 34 of the
[1:03:08] congregation they were not
[1:03:12] Believers
[1:03:14] opportunistic blessed be the name of the
[1:03:16] Lord and I believe in the coming of the
[1:03:19] lord it's like it's delaying
[1:03:23] because blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:03:27] God is trying is using his
[1:03:30] [Music]
[1:03:32] ceve praise be to God that's why even in
[1:03:36] the church we have three kind of
[1:03:38] Believers but when do you tell that this
[1:03:40] one is to make a Believer let the
[1:03:42] stuation come in the
[1:03:45] church praise be to God but when all of
[1:03:49] us we okay you can't tell
[1:03:56] praise be to God because me pretends to
[1:03:59] be a
[1:04:01] believer the bible say that God allowed
[1:04:04] them to pass through the Wilderness
[1:04:06] because he wanted to know what was in
[1:04:07] their
[1:04:22] heart praise be to God and that's what
[1:04:25] God God wanted to see because Moses did
[1:04:28] not know that the cors and the Dan were
[1:04:31] there but God had to give it time and
[1:04:35] raise the sttion blessed be the name of
[1:04:37] the Lord
[1:04:40] amen praise be to God so Breen we must
[1:04:44] know why we are here and we must know
[1:04:48] what we are aiming for praise be to God
[1:04:59] you are going for a race and you taking
[1:05:00] 10 L of
[1:05:03] porridge you are
[1:05:17] eating that can't be praise be to God
[1:05:21] look at the
[1:05:23] boxers they in fact if you look at
[1:05:25] boxers and the
[1:05:27] athletic they have something in
[1:05:30] common
[1:05:36] training they preparing their lungs amen
[1:05:39] their
[1:05:41] organs their body they have to be
[1:05:44] physically fit and the Bible tells us
[1:05:47] that let the
[1:05:48] physical teaches us the spiritual praise
[1:05:51] be to
[1:05:52] God people go to gym because they want
[1:05:55] want to be
[1:05:58] fit and I remember one time brother Ken
[1:06:00] told us this is our spiritual gym amen
[1:06:04] where we make spiritual
[1:06:07] muscles nobody goes to
[1:06:15] gym but when we come to Christ
[1:06:19] uhuh we make it different blessed be the
[1:06:22] name of the
[1:06:23] Lord so we must be willing and be ready
[1:06:26] to run the race because God shows you he
[1:06:30] knows that you are the best Runners but
[1:06:33] most time we want to run with other
[1:06:35] things you want to run with boyfriend
[1:06:37] beside
[1:06:39] you you are running with
[1:06:45] girlfriend praise be to God we are
[1:06:47] running with the
[1:06:50] world the Bible says that heavens and
[1:06:52] earth will pass away and again brother
[1:06:55] who is working to go to go to heaven you
[1:06:58] again running with the world where are
[1:07:00] you taking your world when the word says
[1:07:03] it's going to pass
[1:07:05] away you want to escape the world to
[1:07:07] Heaven you shall not go
[1:07:09] there praise be to
[1:07:12] God
[1:07:21] Amen without death there is no life
[1:07:23] butam tells us that unless we are ready
[1:07:26] to die we are not worthy to live we must
[1:07:30] be ready and willing to
[1:07:32] sacrifice praise be to
[1:07:35] God this life is short we don't know
[1:07:38] what tomorrow hold we don't know what
[1:07:41] the next minutes hold amen Anything Can
[1:07:44] Happen anytime
[1:07:48] anywhere and sometime when we hear
[1:07:56] we are also speaking to
[1:07:58] ourselves praise be to
[1:08:01] God
[1:08:02] Amen so God is looking for perfect
[1:08:06] Runners
[1:08:08] amen with his
[1:08:10] Perfection is the one who elects you but
[1:08:13] remember there must be a willingness in
[1:08:21] you the kind of Christian you want to be
[1:08:25] the kind of Runner you want to be
[1:08:30] amen if you want to be look home it's up
[1:08:32] to you you will be
[1:08:34] look but remember if you look at the
[1:08:38] strategy of the race the first Runners
[1:08:42] and the last Runners if you look at like
[1:08:44] relay they will choose the best Runners
[1:08:48] to start the game and they will choose
[1:08:51] the best to finish the game
[1:08:56] in fact the last one they are the super
[1:08:57] Runners
[1:09:06] amen that's why through the church ages
[1:09:10] amen Paul was the best runner he started
[1:09:14] the race amen and when he reached his
[1:09:17] dying point he says I have run the
[1:09:21] race I have kept the faith amen he was
[1:09:25] sure he knew what he was talking about
[1:09:28] Paul kept the faith Paul ran the rest
[1:09:33] and he finished the rest blessed be the
[1:09:37] name of the
[1:09:39] Lord
[1:09:41] amen is dripping with the blood the
[1:09:44] apostles they kept the
[1:09:46] rest they ran a good run of fre amen
[1:09:58] and then we seeing through the
[1:10:05] age amen
[1:10:20] [Music]
[1:10:40] [Music]

[1:32:35] so much I hid it somewhere where even
[1:32:38] the brother was in the house did not
[1:32:40] know but when thieves came brother I'm
[1:32:43] telling you I think they even Leed on
[1:32:45] that one
[1:32:47] first it crippled me like for two
[1:32:52] years so
[1:32:54] most time when God comes and speaks we
[1:32:57] think ahh you carry
[1:33:01] on God has a way of doing his
[1:33:04] things I had one of my client was a
[1:33:08] lawyer they stole his laptop with a c
[1:33:11] word with his note and guess what do you
[1:33:14] think it was easy for me to come out of

[1:33:25] told him what is
[1:33:26] me blessed be the name of the Lord I
[1:33:29] pleaded with
[1:33:31] God and I asked God to help me I prayed
[1:33:36] and cried to

[1:35:22] love he rebuked
[1:35:24] and correct them
[1:35:32] and the Hand of the
[1:35:34] Lord it grabs
[1:35:41] slowly that's why the prophet even
[1:35:43] sometime says that sometime ministers
[1:35:46] should be careful you are praying for
[1:35:48] somebody you are casting a spirit God is
[1:35:51] God has put maybe a cast on somebody

[1:36:40] find that gu is like as if it got stuck
[1:36:43] there yesterday not even a a screw has
[1:36:47] been removed from it if the world people

[1:37:20] have not happened blessed be the name
[1:37:23] name of the
[1:37:24] Lord but he knew that I would not run
[1:37:27] this race with football and world and
[1:37:30] games beside me amen just imagine if you
[1:37:35] can spend 6 7 hours playing a video
[1:37:41] game if you can just divert that and
[1:37:45] spend 7 hours praying and reading the
[1:37:48] word where would do you be
[1:37:53] here you'll be gaining your soul will be
[1:37:56] growing blessed be the name of the Lord
