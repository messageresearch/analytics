[1:23:23] will keep my word
[1:23:27] and then yesterday
[1:23:30] night he contacted me and said there is

[1:23:50] Comfort them during this
[1:23:52] time and also the church because of
[1:23:56] their

[1:24:02] good for him to now leave
[1:24:06] them yet they have come because of
[1:24:10] him so he explained to me it took some
[1:24:13] time to explain to

[1:30:59] other
[1:31:01] side so there was a university that was
[1:31:03] coming
[1:31:06] up so I decided to apply there I got all
[1:31:10] the savings that I had worked for for
[1:31:12] the two
[1:31:14] years I put it there and my uncle only
[1:31:17] sent me one
[1:31:20] M but I believe God was like these
[1:31:22] people are going to do it because they
[1:31:23] promise us like by the like by the end
[1:31:26] of that year last year like uh around
[1:31:29] like uh um November they would have
[1:31:31] accredited the cause and we will be

[1:46:03] time so I also would like to appreciate
[1:46:07] the dvf
[1:46:09] family of course this I always say a
[1:46:12] church of younger
[1:46:14] people and there are still many other
[1:46:16] young people who are not yet
[1:46:19] married usually that's how churches
[1:46:22] start if they are to be
[1:46:33] organic you are The Interpreter find the
[1:46:35] [Music]
[1:46:40] [Music]
[1:46:42] word
[1:46:44] well but they
[1:46:49] organic okay
[1:46:51] that's you start from
[1:46:54] you know get young people
[1:46:57] who
[1:46:59] sinful in the church under the word the
[1:47:03] word wases themes them and sets them on
[1:47:07] a c in
[1:47:08] life path of life and you know they get
[1:47:12] married you know there's a time when the
[1:47:15] church is only young
[1:47:17] people on fire for
[1:47:19] God serving God and then after that
[1:47:24] now comes
[1:47:25] in get married after that comes another
[1:47:30] seon babies babies
[1:47:33] everywhere after that season you know
[1:47:36] now they are grown and so there are many
[1:47:40] churches which are Beyond
[1:47:42] us here ATF we still
[1:47:45] here we are young and gr and I've been
[1:47:48] there before in
[1:47:50] Ethiopia and we went through some of
[1:47:52] those
[1:47:54] stages it's never easy I remember when
[1:47:57] time came for babies in
[1:47:59] Ethiopia e ah you know the brothers who
[1:48:03] were acting as
[1:48:06] deacons they were very
[1:48:08] tough but I remember this brother who
[1:48:10] was acting as
[1:48:12] Aon was married but not with a baby
[1:48:15] yet my baby is
[1:48:18] Elizabeth and and were very young and
[1:48:23] especially Elizabeth used to make a lot
[1:48:24] of
[1:48:26] noise and so this brother would be very
[1:48:31] angry but later on when he got
[1:48:34] babies I notic he very gentle with
[1:48:38] them I mean we go through
[1:48:41] stages and we here at dvf are going
[1:48:44] through those stages
[1:48:46] now
[1:48:48] thees we will get to that certain level
[1:48:52] but we I know we have also older mothers
[1:48:56] and who are behind to
[1:49:00] support I think it's a wonderful thing
[1:49:03] happen you know we are raising a
[1:49:06] generation of younger people that are
[1:49:08] going to be the
[1:49:11] pillars of the
[1:49:13] word in the Next
[1:49:15] Generation not only in our church family
[1:49:18] here but also
[1:49:21] outside in other places other
[1:49:24] local sometimes they move for
[1:49:28] work you know and you find that another
[1:49:30] church has been started
[1:49:32] somewh sometimes they move to another
[1:49:35] country but whatever it is we are
[1:49:38] raising a
[1:49:40] generation that is going to
[1:49:42] heaven you want to be a part of
[1:49:45] it so God will bless you and you should
[1:49:49] always stick with one
[1:49:51] another support one
[1:49:53] of course where there are many young
[1:49:55] people you expect a lot of
[1:49:58] mistakes and a lot of wrongdoing here
[1:50:00] and
[1:50:01] there but God is
[1:50:03] Grace always
[1:50:06] Prevail them out so God bless you let us

[1:58:07] that she should not have compassion on
[1:58:09] the son of her
[1:58:11] womb yeah they may forget yet will I not
[1:58:14] forget thee behold I have Graven thee
[1:58:17] upon the palms of my hands thy walls are
[1:58:20] continually before me
[1:58:26] [Music]
[1:58:38] amen amen amen you may be
[1:58:42] seated I'm speaking on the Lord knowth
[1:58:46] them that are his
[1:58:53] the Lord knoweth them that
[1:58:55] are and I'm taking that out of verse
[1:58:59] 19 where he says nevertheless the
[1:59:01] foundation of God standeth
[1:59:04] sure having this seal the Lord knoweth
[1:59:08] them that are
[1:59:10] his and let everyone that nameth the
[1:59:13] name of Christ depart from
[1:59:17] iniquity amen and I know the Saints in
[1:59:20] usually fellowship with us on why ours
[1:59:23] to
[1:59:26] you so now I want us to First Look at
[1:59:29] verse 16
[1:59:31] there where he says sh profane and vain
[1:59:34] bubblings for they will increase unto
[1:59:36] more ungodliness
[1:59:49] [Music]
[1:59:54] you know when it comes to uh
[1:59:59] Christianity it is an exclusive
[2:00:05] Community I want to say a few direct
[2:00:08] statements today this morning and so I
[2:00:09] want you to give me your undivided
[2:00:14] attention not an inclusive
[2:00:20] community is
[2:00:23] [Music]
[2:00:26] exclusive actually you cannot be a
[2:00:30] Christian until you accept to
[2:00:34] separate yourself from the rest of the
[2:00:38] people are they evil they may not be
[2:00:41] evil but the issue is they do not
[2:00:45] believe and when you believe
[2:00:48] automatically from that moment you are
[2:00:51] supposed to be
[2:00:53] separate you are supposed to be
[2:00:55] different you are supposed to you know
[2:00:58] be the
[2:00:59] standard you know the world is
[2:01:01] bleeding you know when you see things
[2:01:03] that are happening in the
[2:01:05] world it's more so in our
[2:01:08] generation you know people are taking
[2:01:10] the name of God in
[2:01:13] vain you know you find a person that you
[2:01:16] thought ah maybe this one is ways into
[2:01:19] the world
[2:01:22] maybe because of their
[2:01:24] looks or because of their evil
[2:01:27] speech and then you approach them to
[2:01:29] reach out and give them
[2:01:32] Christ and then they will tell
[2:01:36] you so really you
[2:01:38] wonder who is not loc these
[2:01:41] days but are they in their
[2:01:45] work in their
[2:01:47] words but their works are ways away from
[2:01:50] what they confessing to be
[2:01:55] but God is raising a
[2:01:57] generation people who are going to
[2:02:00] leave
[2:02:04] talk this word will come and live in
[2:02:08] them that is why when we come to
[2:02:11] church we are not coming here to do
[2:02:15] entertainment you know because it's not
[2:02:17] entertainment that will bring us into
[2:02:19] the image of Christ
[2:02:23] we come here every day to hear the
[2:02:26] word the word receive the word that we
[2:02:30] cannot become the
[2:02:32] word so it it comes to a
[2:02:35] place where you have to
[2:02:38] accept to be
[2:02:40] separated to be
[2:02:42] separate separate from Evil
[2:02:45] thoughts separate from the
[2:02:49] scoffers the other time we talked about
[2:02:51] the scoffers
[2:02:53] you know there will be scoffers in the
[2:02:54] end
[2:02:56] time don't believe what you
[2:02:58] believe but they laugh at you for what
[2:03:01] you
[2:03:02] believe but now this morning I'm
[2:03:05] speaking about being
[2:03:08] separated because we cannot serve
[2:03:11] anybody you know sometimes you cling on
[2:03:13] to a
[2:03:16] friend you know I've seen even people
[2:03:20] Brothers I know a few here that have
[2:03:23] come to me keeping friends with the
[2:03:26] world for one year 2 3 and you will ask
[2:03:30] them why and they would say I'm trying
[2:03:33] to attract them to
[2:03:36] Christ but the longer they stay with
[2:03:39] them the longer they get dragged into
[2:03:41] the
[2:03:44] world so you wonder who is changing
[2:03:48] who if someone is in a ditch
[2:03:52] and you're pulling them
[2:03:53] out who is likely to
[2:04:00] fall come on the one who is
[2:04:05] up that's why when a brother falls into
[2:04:09] temptation the Bible says yes we help
[2:04:11] them not everyone should
[2:04:14] help those who are
[2:04:18] spiritual but also taking care of
[2:04:20] themselves
[2:04:22] unless they
[2:04:24] fall so you see they keep you know
[2:04:26] pulling one year two years pulling p and
[2:04:30] the more you pulling the more you are
[2:04:32] going
[2:04:33] down you you will be
[2:04:36] down so the Bible then talks about
[2:04:41] separation the more Cain rather the more
[2:04:44] you know Abraham went with
[2:04:47] Lord the longer he went with him the
[2:04:50] more God was
[2:04:52] let me tell you
[2:04:54] Christianity is not
[2:04:56] a and it's not it's not a religion they
[2:05:00] are not words it's a life and let me
[2:05:03] tell you there is no denomination in the
[2:05:05] world
[2:05:06] today that has the grace toher us into
[2:05:10] the
[2:05:11] life and I'll give you the answer why
[2:05:15] because they have exchanged the word of
[2:05:18] God for entertainment
[2:05:21] have exch people think they literally go
[2:05:23] to
[2:05:25] church to be made
[2:05:29] Rich that they go to
[2:05:31] receive you know you know the man of God
[2:05:34] will
[2:05:35] say yes then you give gives you we are
[2:05:40] receiving the more they receive the more
[2:05:43] their pastors will become
[2:05:45] rich and the more the people will become
[2:05:49] poor the more they they stay in the
[2:05:51] church
[2:05:52] so we have changed the purpose of
[2:05:56] church what is the purpose of
[2:05:59] church the purpose of church is to go so
[2:06:02] that we can be brought closer to
[2:06:05] God so that we can be
[2:06:08] change but that comes only by one
[2:06:11] thing by the word not even by
[2:06:15] song singing Only creates an
[2:06:19] atmosphere and that's why the message of
[2:06:22] the
[2:06:22] hour is the only hope in our
[2:06:25] generation the message of the hour is
[2:06:28] the only light in the mid of
[2:06:31] Darkness that's why we left our
[2:06:34] denomination that's why you were
[2:06:36] catholic
[2:06:40] but but you are here are you here this
[2:06:44] morning you come why didn't you remain
[2:06:47] in your denomination you must have been
[2:06:49] orthodox
[2:06:51] been Muslim been all these things
[2:06:55] religions they are good in that they
[2:06:58] teach good
[2:06:59] behavior but we left because we needed
[2:07:03] something more than
[2:07:05] religion we left because we wanted
[2:07:08] something that can take us to
[2:07:10] heaven we are here because we are hungry
[2:07:14] for the
[2:07:16] world how many are angry for the
[2:07:19] word hry for the word we are tired of
[2:07:23] games we are tired of just
[2:07:26] singing We are tired of crying but
[2:07:29] without the
[2:07:30] life why we are here not only to hear we
[2:07:35] are here
[2:07:37] Chang and if this message cannot change
[2:07:40] you then there is a problem with your
[2:07:44] seed because this message amen is a seed
[2:07:49] itself and it comes and amen contract
[2:07:52] your
[2:07:53] SE and then you begin to realize
[2:07:57] you and when you realize your
[2:08:00] NE begin
[2:08:02] toire to be closed
[2:08:05] upon to be closed upon and let me tell
[2:08:08] you we have another
[2:08:10] body amen when this one is dissolved we
[2:08:14] have another body waiting but the only
[2:08:17] thing that can make us get connected to
[2:08:20] our spiritual
[2:08:24] is the word of
[2:08:26] God let me tell you before we even
[2:08:30] born we have our spiritual
[2:08:33] bodies in the presence of
[2:08:36] God
[2:08:38] theop when we coming down
[2:08:41] here we bypassed our
[2:08:45] theop we bypassed it and came straight
[2:08:48] into this body ofh
[2:08:51] this sinful body but since we had the
[2:08:55] word we been having hunger we been
[2:08:59] having a
[2:09:00] desire something
[2:09:02] more amen and the moment we had the
[2:09:05] word we received the word I I would read
[2:09:08] for you that later he says we heard from
[2:09:10] our
[2:09:13] Fe we got connected to our
[2:09:17] spiritual so even when you say Amen it's
[2:09:20] not the body saying
[2:09:23] that inside of
[2:09:25] you whiches to
[2:09:28] go and friends that's why the Bible says
[2:09:32] sh profane and vain
[2:09:37] bubbling there are people
[2:09:40] who have made it a
[2:09:44] job joke
[2:09:47] around and you know did you know that
[2:09:49] every word you speak
[2:09:52] every ID
[2:09:54] word you will give account for
[2:09:57] it every ID word you give
[2:10:04] an in Titus 3:9 it
[2:10:07] says but avoid foolish
[2:10:10] questions and and genealogies and
[2:10:13] contentions and strivings about the law
[2:10:28] for they are unprofitable and
[2:10:31] [Music]
[2:10:32] vain I always love sharing the word with
[2:10:37] people and you know sometimes you have
[2:10:39] to labor for
[2:10:41] hours showing something the truth of
[2:10:45] scripture but there are some people that
[2:10:49] you can begin to talk to and they just
[2:10:52] you know they uh they just strive with
[2:10:56] you they contend with you and they pull
[2:10:59] and they
[2:11:01] push such questions the Bible calls them
[2:11:04] foolish
[2:11:06] questions
[2:11:08] contention striving against the
[2:11:10] word he says that is
[2:11:14] unprofitable and usually the moment I
[2:11:16] see someone is is just
[2:11:19] contending I close my
[2:11:25] because whatever is going to come
[2:11:28] out is
[2:11:30] unprofitable
[2:11:32] v a man that is
[2:11:36] a after now you can read verse 10 a man
[2:11:40] that istic after the first and second
[2:11:42] admonition reject
[2:11:54] Hallelujah he didn't he didn't say you
[2:11:56] know Don't Preach to someone who is
[2:11:58] likely to reject the
[2:12:00] [Music]
[2:12:02] word that's why I believe that everyone
[2:12:06] is a potential
[2:12:08] believer even someone in a
[2:12:11] bar even a prostitute one time in
[2:12:14] Ethiopia we preached to a
[2:12:16] prute we did not know she would
[2:12:18] believe and you know how we met her
[2:12:21] we met at a post of Duty
[2:12:25] on with my brother Paul from and we did
[2:12:29] not know that she was
[2:12:30] atit but it turned out she was
[2:12:34] atit me I began shaking because i' never
[2:12:38] exp but Paul had been in that kind of
[2:12:41] life
[2:12:42] before that's why I told him I told him
[2:12:44] brother
[2:12:46] approach and then we can see how to go
[2:12:48] about so he talked to her for a while
[2:12:52] and then it brought it to an
[2:12:54] atmosphere where we now made an
[2:12:56] appointment with
[2:12:58] her so we went and she came to
[2:13:03] appointment in our place where we're
[2:13:06] living but before she could come we
[2:13:09] invited our sister yod to
[2:13:11] come y
[2:13:14] came she came in that room and and we
[2:13:18] told her
[2:13:19] everything what had happened she said I
[2:13:22] don't I love sister because she's all
[2:13:26] G she said we ready
[2:13:29] for so when she
[2:13:31] came you know she was all dressed
[2:13:37] up and you know walking like so as she
[2:13:41] was walking in she was shocked to see I
[2:13:44] was there was
[2:13:47] there and that did not Shock her much
[2:13:51] but what shocked her more was she saw
[2:13:53] Bibles and they were all
[2:13:56] open we were ready for
[2:13:58] her and as soon as she sat down she came
[2:14:02] with a different mindset but as soon as
[2:14:04] she sat down we began opening the
[2:14:07] scriptures bringing Christ to her we did
[2:14:11] not care about her
[2:14:13] situation we just began going into the
[2:14:16] word word the word the word friend
[2:14:21] doesn't matter how your situation
[2:14:23] is just come and sit under the word the
[2:14:27] word has
[2:14:28] power power to change the
[2:14:32] violence the
[2:14:34] power I don't know I cannot
[2:14:37] describe the power of the word in the
[2:14:41] next few moments she began crying what
[2:14:44] was
[2:14:48] that let me tell you friend you have a
[2:14:52] soul the word will Smite your
[2:14:55] soul the word will condemn you and then
[2:14:58] convict you and then you will confess
[2:15:02] and then you will repent and then you'll
[2:15:04] be made
[2:15:06] holy hallelujah amen and as she began
[2:15:09] crying she said I don't know what to do
[2:15:13] because for 10 years all I have known to
[2:15:15] do is
[2:15:17] prostitution what can I do now
[2:15:21] the only thing I can do meaning I don't
[2:15:23] know how to leave
[2:15:25] it I but I don't know
[2:15:28] how and she said even if I tried I know
[2:15:32] I couldn't I don't want to play with the
[2:15:35] blood of
[2:15:36] God and I told her oh sister don't worry
[2:15:41] we went to the word
[2:15:43] again not by power by by
[2:15:48] my say the Lord brother sister don't you
[2:15:53] worry about what you have done the blood
[2:15:56] of Jesus will cover your sins don't you
[2:15:59] worry about your ability all you need is
[2:16:04] your
[2:16:05] Fai just believe it and then the word of
[2:16:09] God will go to
[2:16:11] work amen she began crying crying tears
[2:16:16] were
[2:16:17] flowing and then she said I have
[2:16:20] believed
[2:16:21] I have decided I want to be
[2:16:25] baptized Hallelujah for the first time
[2:16:29] in my life I saw a prostitute being
[2:16:33] baptized I saw a prostitute CH I'm
[2:16:37] telling you today you may be a
[2:16:39] prostitute you may even be worse you may
[2:16:42] be even less I don't care the word of
[2:16:46] God
[2:16:49] the amen
[2:16:51] hallelujah hallelujah just sit under
[2:16:54] that
[2:16:55] word you know I believe anyone can be
[2:16:59] saved everyone can be we are not sent
[2:17:03] out to go and check who will
[2:17:07] believe we are sent to give the word
[2:17:11] amen even God came down and he told Kan
[2:17:25] understand do you know ACC to
[2:17:27] the serpent seed can't be
[2:17:33] saved he doesn't have a seed
[2:17:41] ofel did God preach
[2:17:44] to he didn't come down tearing
[2:17:46] him saying oh you who are going
[2:17:49] to no
[2:17:51] he told
[2:17:52] him
[2:17:55] son don't you know if you do
[2:18:00] well you will be
[2:18:03] accepted do you think God was
[2:18:05] lying God always does
[2:18:08] not what am I saying the word of God
[2:18:12] always gives a benefit of
[2:18:15] Doubt to anyone and
[2:18:18] everyone amen having this hope
[2:18:21] that the word of God has power
[2:18:23] to the word of God has power to
[2:18:27] redeem all through that amen God knows
[2:18:31] those that are
[2:18:34] his Hallelujah but we don't know so what
[2:18:38] do we do we cast a
[2:18:41] net and then God brings
[2:18:44] them but you see there are others who
[2:18:47] just have foolish
[2:18:49] questions come to
[2:18:52] but the Bible says to
[2:18:55] a after the first
[2:18:58] admon and
[2:19:00] second if they don't believe and they
[2:19:03] begin contending with you he says then
[2:19:08] reject knowing that he that is such is
[2:19:13] [Music]
[2:19:16] subverted are you hearing me
[2:19:19] Church it means
[2:19:23] stabilized
[2:19:26] corrupt Hees the power and authority of
[2:19:29] the
[2:19:32] world is
[2:19:34] subverted
[2:19:36] and being condemned of
[2:19:40] himself can you imagine God gives
[2:19:43] Grace but the grace he gives he gives it
[2:19:47] to such as would receive it
[2:19:51] he says for God so Lov the world that he
[2:19:54] gave his only begotten son whoever does
[2:19:59] what should not perish but shall have
[2:20:02] everlasting life he says after you
[2:20:04] preach with them the first time they
[2:20:07] have refused the second time refused
[2:20:10] those
[2:20:13] rejected may God never reject
[2:20:16] me may God never reject me let me he let
[2:20:21] me believe at my first time hearing of
[2:20:24] the
[2:20:26] word first Timothy
[2:20:30] 6:26 oh Timothy keep that which is
[2:20:33] committed to thy
[2:20:35] trust avoid profane and Vain
[2:20:39] bubblings and oppositions of science

[2:20:49] saying to Timothy he says you have been
[2:20:52] given something in your
[2:20:55] trust the word of God is a sacred
[2:21:01] trust that God has given to us this is
[2:21:05] more than
[2:21:06] religion this is more than our
[2:21:08] culture it's more than our
[2:21:11] understanding it doesn't matter whether
[2:21:13] you are from the poorest of the poor

[2:21:17] rich or whether you're from the Royal

[2:21:30] new
[2:21:31] generation of the people of God who are
[2:21:35] going to inherit this
[2:21:38] earth that is why the word of God has to
[2:21:43] change our
[2:21:44] mind to renew our
[2:21:48] mind it some people call it
[2:21:52] brainwashing let me tell you brother I

[2:23:19] amen he has trusted you with this
[2:23:22] word and therefore he said brother
[2:23:25] sister
[2:23:26] avoid any profane and vain
[2:23:31] bubblings don't let
[2:23:33] anybody bre down this
[2:23:36] word don't let
[2:23:38] anybody this
[2:23:40] word it is important if God said it is
[2:23:44] important the Bible says in his word
[2:23:47] free
[2:23:49] fornication is that
[2:23:51] important is that
[2:23:53] important the word of God said women
[2:23:57] shall not wear that which pertain
[2:24:01] unto sister is that
[2:24:04] important don't let anyone tell you it's
[2:24:08] okay to wear
[2:24:09] trousers is not okay because God said
[2:24:16] soan and Ving
[2:24:20] praise God if the prophet of God
[2:24:23] said that if you see a woman making
[2:24:29] up with all these kind of
[2:24:32] things that she is like
[2:24:36] Jezebel and Jezebel was fed to
[2:24:40] dog and actually the prophet used Words
[2:24:42] which were so
[2:24:44] powerful which would even preachers fear
[2:24:46] to
[2:24:47] say he says call that kind of woman
[2:24:54] how do you
[2:24:58] do Pastor I want to leave
[2:25:03] now I'm
[2:25:04] sorry I was cting the
[2:25:07] prophet his name is
[2:25:10] williami
[2:25:13] Bram we have been entrusted by
[2:25:17] that do you mean we don't believe in
[2:25:19] makeup
[2:25:22] sah never made
[2:25:24] up never made
[2:25:26] up
[2:25:28] did was fed to the do because she was a
[2:25:31] woman of bad
[2:25:32] character why do you pick on
[2:25:36] women because women are the type of the
[2:25:40] church we all are one
[2:25:43] woman we are the bride of
[2:25:46] Christ the woman is the image of the man
[2:25:50] woman shows the the
[2:25:52] man he says don't you worry no matter
[2:25:56] what a man says he
[2:25:57] is you may come here and B to be a man
[2:26:01] of God to be anointed he said if you see
[2:26:07] what you
[2:26:10] married see what he married today can
[2:26:14] come here and say praise
[2:26:16] God let us see his wife is she image of
[2:26:21] Christ then shame is a
[2:26:23] Believer and will come and
[2:26:26] say bless
[2:26:28] you wait let sit behind you who is your
[2:26:32] wife you very
[2:26:34] Spirit Hallelujah Pastor you very hard
[2:26:38] preing don't you worry look at my wife
[2:26:42] if my wife is not fitting this
[2:26:44] word then don't hear me because I am
[2:26:48] lying to you me myself not
[2:26:51] change let me tell you
[2:26:53] brother the wife that's say is the
[2:26:57] second best
[2:27:00] gift to
[2:27:04] Salvation that's why the devil has come
[2:27:07] to the
[2:27:08] woman from the very beginning to try and
[2:27:12] defile her so that he can defile the
[2:27:14] whole human
[2:27:16] race and that's why today by this
[2:27:19] message of the hour
[2:27:21] God has measured on a
[2:27:23] woman when a woman is
[2:27:26] changed a generation is going
[2:27:28] to the devil came to a
[2:27:31] woman and destroyed her and destroyed
[2:27:34] the whole human because of every
[2:27:37] sickness it was because of the
[2:27:40] woman every sickness every fear death
[2:27:45] because of what the devil did to the
[2:27:46] woman but I want to say praise God
[2:27:50] came down again and he came to
[2:27:54] what
[2:27:55] woman and her name was her name was
[2:28:01] Mary Mary Hallelujah when the angel of
[2:28:05] the Lord came
[2:28:07] down blessed are you
[2:28:09] woman among all
[2:28:12] women why did God come to a woman
[2:28:16] because the devil came to a
[2:28:18] woman God wanted to show the devil you
[2:28:21] came to a woman and destroyed everything
[2:28:25] I am coming to a woman resurrect
[2:28:30] everything Hallelujah and out of one
[2:28:34] woman everyone in the world has known
[2:28:40] salvation that's why the end time
[2:28:43] church WIll major on the
[2:28:46] woman pauled on a woman
[2:28:50] and even many preachers in the in the
[2:28:51] secular
[2:28:52] World they don't like Paul they say Paul
[2:28:55] was always speaking on
[2:28:57] women but let me tell you if you want to
[2:29:00] know the spiritual state of the
[2:29:04] church look at the sister in the
[2:29:07] church if you see them wearing this
[2:29:12] long whatever their
[2:29:15] nails cutting off
[2:29:18] the h
[2:29:21] brother run there's a problem with that
[2:29:23] church there is a problem with that
[2:29:26] church but when you see women who are
[2:29:29] Godly women who are virtuous women then
[2:29:32] it means that church is receiving the
[2:29:38] word I wish I had time to give you a
[2:29:41] scripture for whatever I'm
[2:29:44] saying praise God and that's why even
[2:29:47] the men in the world
[2:29:51] they come in the
[2:29:53] Church of the message
[2:29:56] Bel to try and trap some
[2:30:00] sister so they can marry them and then
[2:30:04] they run
[2:30:05] away they show their true
[2:30:08] colors because they know we have the
[2:30:10] real
[2:30:14] deal and we are not ashamed to say
[2:30:17] that that's why all Pastors in the
[2:30:19] message
[2:30:21] protective of
[2:30:24] their because we know there are many Wes
[2:30:28] out
[2:30:30] there thank God for this
[2:30:33] message thank God for this
[2:30:37] message he has trusted us with it he has
[2:30:41] committed to that to our
[2:30:43] trust and he said avoid avoid profane
[2:30:46] and Vain
[2:30:47] bubblings and oppositions of F
[2:30:51] soal they say they know a lot and so
[2:30:55] they are speaking to you what they don't
[2:30:57] know I don't care what you have read you
[2:31:00] may have finished your
[2:31:02] PhD but if I know the word I still know
[2:31:05] more than you
[2:31:06] know because to know him is
[2:31:10] life there is nothing you can
[2:31:13] study and
[2:31:15] know and then you go beyond the word of
[2:31:17] God
[2:31:21] nothing until today there is no person
[2:31:24] who has studed
[2:31:26] geometry to the
[2:31:28] extent that he can rebuild the Great
[2:31:31] Pyramid of
[2:31:36] Giza no one the Great Pyramid of
[2:31:40] giz one time we'll talk about it
[2:31:43] here no one knows what who
[2:31:46] build but God sent a prophet in our
[2:31:48] generation
[2:31:50] brother William he said it is Enoch who
[2:31:54] built
[2:31:56] it Enoch was the seven from
[2:31:59] Adam he built that pyramid and he says
[2:32:02] whoever built it was perfect
[2:32:08] inry is
[2:32:12] buth and and every measurement there is
[2:32:17] perfect and no they can't rebuild
[2:32:22] who gave him the
[2:32:24] wisdom who gave him the
[2:32:26] knowledge
[2:32:28] did and he says those Vain and profane
[2:32:33] bubblings they try to ridicule and talk
[2:32:35] down the
[2:32:38] world as if to say they have something
[2:32:40] else to guide their
[2:32:44] life our
[2:32:46] Compass is the word of God
[2:32:50] imagine if you were in a forest
[2:32:52] somewhere and you're lost you don't know
[2:32:55] where to
[2:32:57] go but as a good uh you know uh person
[2:33:01] that knows how to take those
[2:33:04] trips Explorer let me say that you
[2:33:08] should have a campass
[2:33:09] with many explorers that came to
[2:33:12] Africa they had a compass with them
[2:33:16] because they then they did not know
[2:33:18] where to go and where not to go
[2:33:22] they know that Europe is here Africa is
[2:33:28] here and so they would
[2:33:30] read on the campus how many know a
[2:33:35] campus
[2:33:39] okay it shows that this is
[2:33:42] North this is
[2:33:45] East
[2:33:46] W I have a campass here
[2:33:50] I don't know how many can see
[2:33:52] this praise the name of the
[2:33:55] Lord so this is a
[2:33:57] compass praise
[2:34:00] God where is
[2:34:03] West can someone show me where West
[2:34:14] is you don't know you're not sure but
[2:34:17] when you have a campus it will show
[2:34:23] it will
[2:34:31] show but the will
[2:34:35] be even when you think
[2:34:38] something the camp will
[2:34:40] correct you must be able to read
[2:34:43] it you must know how to
[2:34:45] read one time there is a man who was
[2:34:49] reading it
[2:34:51] called the Ethiopian
[2:34:54] un and a man came to him called Philip
[2:34:58] do you know what you
[2:34:59] reading do you understand he said how
[2:35:02] can I understand without someone to
[2:35:06] interpret and he began from that very
[2:35:08] scripture to preach to him on Christ and
[2:35:12] that very day that Ethiopian man was
[2:35:16] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:35:19] Christ
[2:35:20] what happened someone read a campus for
[2:35:24] God sends us
[2:35:28] prophets that's why we need
[2:35:30] them so we can understand the word of
[2:35:33] God the word of God is the
[2:35:36] compass the word of God is our
[2:35:39] filter friend don't let your education
[2:35:41] be a
[2:35:44] filter don't let your knowledge that you
[2:35:46] have gathered from whever be your filter
[2:35:51] they have been great men in this
[2:35:54] world but they are now no
[2:35:56] more men like Alexander the
[2:35:59] Great there are now no more men like
[2:36:03] Hitler there are now no more men like
[2:36:05] the Emperors of
[2:36:07] Rome no but the word of God abides
[2:36:12] forever let the word of God be your
[2:36:15] compass let the word of God be the
[2:36:18] filter
[2:36:20] by which you
[2:36:21] think by which you act by which you do
[2:36:25] your things in
[2:36:26] life oh friends listen to me whatever
[2:36:30] you are doing ask yourself what does the
[2:36:33] word of God
[2:36:37] say if you don't do that you are blind
[2:36:42] you are blind you do not know the Bible
[2:36:46] says
[2:36:47] in people would be blind
[2:36:51] but they wouldn't
[2:36:52] know but he would
[2:36:56] send send amen clothing he would send
[2:37:02] what is this it is the end time
[2:37:06] message the message of the
[2:37:09] cross the message of
[2:37:11] Salvation the message that has revealed
[2:37:14] to
[2:37:15] us Christ Jesus in our day
[2:37:20] he says those people who thought they
[2:37:21] were
[2:37:23] wise some professing that they have
[2:37:27] errored they have errored concerning
[2:37:30] the look at tius
[2:37:34] 13 this witness is true where rebuke
[2:37:38] them sharply that they may be sound in
[2:37:40] the faith
[2:37:50] and forgive us sometimes when we preach
[2:37:52] as if it's a rebuke a sharp
[2:37:56] rebuke sometimes it is
[2:37:59] necessary it says not giving he to
[2:38:01] Jewish fees and Commandments of men that
[2:38:05] turn from the
[2:38:15] truth they turn from the
[2:38:17] truth go to the fables and Comm
[2:38:22] that's why talking about
[2:38:25] culture culture is good
[2:38:28] problem but where
[2:38:30] culture goes against the
[2:38:33] word that's a
[2:38:38] are we are the people we are we are
[2:38:41] royal priesthood now let me tell
[2:38:44] you always filter everything by the word
[2:38:50] always if your culture tells you to do
[2:38:53] this and
[2:38:54] [Music]
[2:38:55] this before you do it don't say no
[2:39:03] problem let me do it
[2:39:06] wait what does the word
[2:39:10] of if you're not sure
[2:39:12] ask ask call your pastor call Aon call
[2:39:16] call Minister what does the word of say
[2:39:19] about
[2:39:23] this they have gone
[2:39:26] to I don't even know how it is in
[2:39:28] English to finish because it is a
[2:39:30] cultural
[2:39:34] term to bust
[2:39:39] death how many not busting about
[2:39:43] busting I'm directly
[2:39:46] translating because I don't know
[2:39:51] but really when you go into the what
[2:39:53] they
[2:39:54] mean they mean
[2:39:56] busting finishing
[2:40:01] death removing death out of
[2:40:04] the so when someone dies they now have
[2:40:08] to have a special
[2:40:11] ceremony to go and abuse
[2:40:16] death and and and and then to really
[2:40:19] cast it
[2:40:21] out with some
[2:40:24] rituals with some whatever and you find
[2:40:28] believer also being a part of
[2:40:31] that shame on you what does the word of
[2:40:34] God
[2:40:36] say death is a weapon of
[2:40:41] God death is a
[2:40:44] donkey that God
[2:40:47] allows to come will be
[2:40:50] here for
[2:40:52] until the purpose of God has
[2:40:56] been death will be
[2:40:58] here no one can take it
[2:41:00] away and I can tell them they can go
[2:41:04] bursting death in
[2:41:06] their but the people will continue
[2:41:09] dying you see that culture is
[2:41:15] deceiving but for us Believers when a
[2:41:18] brother
[2:41:20] we we are sad in that we have lost
[2:41:24] them we weep in that we are no longer
[2:41:28] with them but we know this one thing the
[2:41:31] Bible says please that in the sight of
[2:41:36] God the death of his
[2:41:40] saintsall sir when a brother died we
[2:41:44] know this one thing we have another body
[2:41:47] waiting
[2:41:49] has gone
[2:41:50] beyond he has gone before us and we are
[2:41:53] going to meet him we are going to meet
[2:41:56] her because death only means
[2:42:00] separation so we not going to go busting
[2:42:07] death speaking evil
[2:42:10] words and
[2:42:14] vever should never be found in that
[2:42:20] if you have been going to bust those
[2:42:23] days may God forgive you don't go
[2:42:27] back when they call you tell I am
[2:42:36] Saed
[2:42:38] amen
[2:42:39] hallelujah they have called
[2:42:42] you that you go and
[2:42:44] dance you
[2:42:47] brother what is wrong
[2:42:49] with there is no problem
[2:42:52] with but the things around they are the
[2:42:55] ones with a
[2:42:57] problem you putting on almost
[2:42:59] NE all the breasts are out the Sid are
[2:43:05] out you a
[2:43:08] brother you make men over you sister
[2:43:13] Bible says the one who does that he has
[2:43:17] committed adultery with you
[2:43:20] brother
[2:43:21] dancing now for that there are certain
[2:43:24] things we choose not to do not because
[2:43:28] they
[2:43:29] are because when you put them in the
[2:43:32] mirror
[2:43:33] of they don't
[2:43:36] pass say I won't go there you say I
[2:43:39] won't do that praise the name of the
[2:43:43] Lord some young man asked me yesterday

[2:44:00] beach it is not
[2:44:04] bad if the Lord gives me some
[2:44:07] money I will go with my wife and my
[2:44:12] children now the holy rers are
[2:44:16] now are you foreign
[2:44:20] okay
[2:44:22] listen
[2:44:24] why why don't we usually go to such
[2:44:27] places why don't we intentionally don't
[2:44:30] go
[2:44:32] there why don't we go
[2:44:35] swiming in such
[2:44:38] places such public
[2:44:41] places somebody's
[2:44:43] naked she's not your wife somebody's

[2:45:38] understanding don't you feel
[2:45:41] judgment if you don't feel condemned you
[2:45:44] have another
[2:45:46] Spirit it is not the spirit of God is
[2:45:48] word
[2:45:50] but the spirit of the Bible will tell
[2:45:52] you that is wrong that is wrong that is
[2:45:57] wrong that is why we don't go in such
[2:46:02] things the day I took my wife another
[2:46:05] people to
[2:46:06] swim we went in a private
[2:46:09] place because we don't
[2:46:13] believe in exposing our naked bodies to
[2:46:17] others believe that
[2:46:22] if you are with me say
[2:46:24] Amen everything we
[2:46:27] do we must look into the
[2:46:30] word and we filter that we have to
[2:46:33] filter everything we are
[2:46:35] doing what does the word
[2:46:38] say am I
[2:46:40] safe am I pleasing
[2:46:43] God I
[2:46:45] can Paul actually said all things are
[2:46:49] lawful to
[2:46:51] me there's no problem there's no problem
[2:46:54] with swimming there's no problem with
[2:46:57] enjoying a
[2:46:58] be problem enjoying
[2:47:01] nature with riding a
[2:47:04] hor whatever you are doing you have to
[2:47:08] ensure it is not
[2:47:13] questionable he said all things are
[2:47:15] lawful but all things are not
[2:47:23] expedience I'm not expedient meaning I
[2:47:25] don't have to do
[2:47:29] all it's not a question of is it
[2:47:32] okay a question of does it please the
[2:47:38] Lord these are things why I'm speaking
[2:47:42] of them that usually cause people to you
[2:47:46] know talk Vain and bubbling
[2:47:56] finding don't do
[2:47:58] that when someone begins to do that just
[2:48:01] walk away you have your
[2:48:05] Revelation it is a trust God has given
[2:48:08] to keep it keep it we entrusted by it
[2:48:20] praise
[2:48:21] God some people have asked
[2:48:23] questions is it okay to
[2:48:27] drink is it a sin to
[2:48:29] drink can I believe I drink
[2:48:38] alcohol now I see all of you looking at
[2:48:45] me when someone said no alcohol is bad
[2:48:50] but wine is
[2:48:52] okay where is that in the
[2:48:57] scripture if it is
[2:49:00] an don't
[2:49:03] know what is
[2:49:05] it English it's called
[2:49:08] what if it is
[2:49:10] alcoholic it will make you
[2:49:13] drunk and when you are drunk you become
[2:49:16] a fool
[2:49:19] the Bible actually
[2:49:20] says hell is made for such people the
[2:49:26] drunkards did you know
[2:49:28] that the revilers the drunkard and all
[2:49:31] the the abusers themselves with Mankind
[2:49:33] and things like
[2:49:37] that hell is for such
[2:49:40] people so then the Bible does not out
[2:49:44] say it is a sin to drink
[2:49:48] and so if you want to look for
[2:49:50] that you will never find it in the
[2:49:54] scripture why because in the New
[2:49:57] Testament is no longer a book of
[2:50:01] rules we are not here to obey
[2:50:05] rules oh now pastor joined your
[2:50:08] church give me a list of rules I
[2:50:12] should we have no law but
[2:50:15] love we have no rules here we just love
[2:50:19] one another and love
[2:50:21] God and love his word so there is no
[2:50:24] list of
[2:50:26] rules whatever you do ask yourself is it
[2:50:30] giving God
[2:50:33] glory so Pastor if I drink
[2:50:37] alcohol I get joy and the Bible tells me
[2:50:40] to have
[2:50:41] joy don't you see now I'm giving God the
[2:50:47] glory that is why what the Bible talked
[2:50:51] about he called it this way he said that
[2:50:56] and oppositions of science fely
[2:51:04] soal I think in your Bible science
[2:51:06] called it okay read it in 1 Timothy 6
[2:51:09] vers verse 20 right there
[2:51:28] praise the name of the Lord so there is
[2:51:31] you know it's oppositions of science for
[2:51:39] soal read it again get it
[2:51:50] yes oppositions of
[2:51:53] science fely
[2:51:56] soal yes they think they know they think
[2:52:00] they have what they're talking they know
[2:52:01] what they're talking
[2:52:02] about but it is false because they don't
[2:52:06] know what they're talking about so now
[2:52:09] the the true Joy of a
[2:52:11] Believer does not come by
[2:52:15] alcohol true Joy of a believer
[2:52:18] come by the Holy
[2:52:20] Ghost when you receive the Holy Spirit
[2:52:23] you get
[2:52:26] drunk that is why I don't believe in
[2:52:30] being you know zero
[2:52:35] temperature of the Holy
[2:52:37] Spirit when I'm in a church that is cold
[2:52:39] and form
[2:52:42] touch I was once in my
[2:52:45] denomination but now I can't imagine
[2:52:48] there
[2:52:50] for I can't imagine sitting in a
[2:52:53] service where where there is no
[2:52:55] noise where there's no shouting in the
[2:52:58] Holy Ghost I can't imagine that because
[2:53:02] the moment I receive the Holy Ghost I
[2:53:05] took a do of the Holy
[2:53:07] Ghost and I got
[2:53:12] drunk drunk that's why whenever
[2:53:16] hear whenever hear the word
[2:53:19] I feel
[2:53:20] excited something from within me amen
[2:53:24] begins to shake begin to run up and down
[2:53:28] and I can't help it but to shout but to
[2:53:31] be happy but to sing but to dance what
[2:53:36] is it I am
[2:53:40] drunk we are drunk on the day of
[2:53:44] Pentecost amen they came down and they
[2:53:47] said look at them
[2:53:49] why are they
[2:53:50] drunk the
[2:53:53] morning and Peter came out he said man
[2:53:56] and Breen these ones are not drunk with
[2:54:00] wine they are not drunk with alcohol
[2:54:04] they are not drun but they are drun of
[2:54:08] the Holy
[2:54:10] Ghost you can be drunk of the Holy
[2:54:13] Ghost you come to church for the first
[2:54:17] day you are Qui
[2:54:19] you come for the second day you are
[2:54:21] silent you come for the third day and
[2:54:23] then you receive something and then all
[2:54:26] of the sudden your silence
[2:54:29] disappears people begin to wonder so and
[2:54:32] so was the most quiet person in
[2:54:35] the what happened to him he got
[2:54:41] drunk I remember when brother Andrew
[2:54:43] told me the other
[2:54:45] day I don't know what happened to me
[2:54:48] I was just worshiping and then all of a
[2:54:51] sudden up up up
[2:54:53] up what happened to me he got drunk
[2:54:58] father when you receive that do of the
[2:54:59] Holy Ghost you receive the joy of the
[2:55:03] Lord amen you that has been sad your
[2:55:07] sadness will fly
[2:55:08] away you that has been
[2:55:11] downcast you feel the joy of the
[2:55:14] lording in your
[2:55:16] soul what we have
[2:55:18] is not just a religion it is more than a
[2:55:21] religion it is the Holy Ghost it is fire
[2:55:26] when he comes upon you he makes a real
[2:55:28] man a real woman out of you hallelujah
[2:55:32] amen you that was a
[2:55:34] sin you begin leaving
[2:55:37] your praise the name of the
[2:55:40] Lord oh my my my I love this
[2:55:44] message turn to your neighbor tell them
[2:55:46] I love this message
[2:55:49] praise
[2:55:53] God those vain
[2:55:56] bubblings is this good is this bad is
[2:55:59] this tell them suit
[2:56:02] yourself here is what the word of God
[2:56:04] says I believe it sett
[2:56:09] it they profess that they know
[2:56:13] God but in in Works they deny him
[2:56:18] being
[2:56:19] [Music]
[2:56:24] abominable read it read it Titus
[2:56:29] 1
[2:56:31] 16
[2:56:46] for my God
[2:56:48] they are
[2:56:51] abominable
[2:56:54] see they
[2:56:56] disobedient they deny Christ in their
[2:57:00] Works they
[2:57:02] disobedient and and very good work
[2:57:08] repr now I wanted to hear what OT in his
[2:57:12] commentary says on this shining of
[2:57:15] profan and vain bubblings
[2:57:20] it says in strong contrast to the
[2:57:22] conduct just urged on the Workman of God
[2:57:26] do thou or withdraw thyself from vain
[2:57:31] bubblings the word rendered Shan is a
[2:57:34] strong
[2:57:37] one and signifies literally to make a
[2:57:40] suir so as to
[2:57:45] avoid or as Al paraphrases it the
[2:57:48] meaning seems to come from a number of
[2:57:50] persons falling back from an
[2:57:55] [Music]
[2:57:58] object an of
[2:58:01] fear or an
[2:58:05] of and standing at a distance
[2:58:09] around for they will increase unto more
[2:58:12] ungodliness those ve
[2:58:16] bubblings better translated for the will
[2:58:18] advance un they will
[2:58:21] increase the tendency of these useless
[2:58:26] discussions and Idol
[2:58:30] disputes is to lead men into Vain and
[2:58:33] pro and profitless
[2:58:39] speculations you know you find some
[2:58:41] people people friends when you are
[2:58:43] together especially you young
[2:58:45] people you know because we have social
[2:58:49] media social media has done a lot to
[2:58:52] advance the
[2:58:55] gospel but it has also killed our
[2:58:57] generation in many
[2:59:00] ways you find people you know seeing
[2:59:02] things
[2:59:04] there and they get
[2:59:06] entertained by to an extent they begin
[2:59:09] sharing it on their own
[2:59:16] citiz you see people have no filter at
[2:59:21] all there are some things that if I'm
[2:59:23] scrolling on my social
[2:59:27] media that I see someone posting
[2:59:30] things I I will see it once and block
[2:59:35] them social Med like Facebook I left
[2:59:39] it it is vain it is
[2:59:43] profane when you see it's it's not
[2:59:46] adding to me is advancing more
[2:59:50] ungodliness and if you have friends
[2:59:53] whenever you meet they just jesting and
[2:59:55] laughing
[2:59:57] and things that you have no
[3:00:00] filter I believe we should have a filter
[3:00:02] of the
[3:00:03] world we should be
[3:00:07] different we should be the S of the
[3:00:10] earth whereby people see us and they see
[3:00:14] something
[3:00:16] different they hear something
[3:00:20] that is what is called the bride of
[3:00:23] Christ we have something we
[3:00:28] Ed he says here in questions and answers
[3:00:30] let your yes be yes and your no be
[3:00:37] no for anything more than this will come
[3:00:39] to
[3:00:41] sin you are not supposed even to
[3:00:45] joke and cut up with one another
[3:00:51] is talking about
[3:00:55] of will make you give an account for
[3:00:57] every ID word that you
[3:01:02] speak we believe
[3:01:04] that the bible say that you will have to
[3:01:07] give an account for every
[3:01:10] ID what kind of a people we to
[3:01:14] be people that is Frank
[3:01:18] people that are

[3:01:22] loving people that are kind and never
[3:01:25] listen to this never a bunch of
[3:01:29] nonsense hallelujah hallelujah

[3:01:45] this Prof and V
[3:01:48] separate yourself from things and
[3:01:50] people that bring you into more
[3:01:54] ungodliness why don't we see God in our
[3:01:58] M because of the atmosphere we live
[3:02:02] in you see the results of vain and
[3:02:05] profan
[3:02:09] bubblings say they
[3:02:15] word oh my God they error concerning the
[3:02:20] truth they they even bring false
[3:02:23] doctrines the resurrection is
[3:02:28] past and they overthrow the faith of
[3:02:32] some so many people are no longer
[3:02:34] believing the
[3:02:36] message we even have some people who
[3:02:38] begin to come on social media and say
[3:02:40] why I left the
[3:02:45] message me I don't listen to such people
[3:02:48] I don't I

[3:15:51] that does not look on top he checks
[3:15:54] heart the first time you have heard your
[3:15:56] Prophet telling you the
[3:15:58] same if someone tells you that tell them
[3:16:02] I already
[3:16:03] know it was spoken in in the
[3:16:07] 1950s by a prophet of God who was
[3:16:11] vindicating that God looks on the
[3:16:14] heart that has never changed
[3:16:18] neither will it ever change but here as
[3:16:21] through all the
[3:16:23] ages there are two
[3:16:25] groups both of the groups are claiming
[3:16:28] their Revelation from God and their
[3:16:29] relationship to
[3:16:35] God
[3:16:36] nevertheless the foundation of God stand
[3:16:40] sure having this
[3:16:43] seal the Lord knoweth them that are
[3:16:49] hallelujah hallelujah the Lord knowe
[3:16:51] them that
[3:16:52] are the Lord searches the
[3:16:56] rains that mean that word
[3:16:59] means to
[3:17:01] track to follow
[3:17:04] up God tracks
[3:17:07] down our
[3:17:09] thoughts which is our
[3:17:11] RS he knows what is in our hearts
[3:17:16] God knows what is in my heart God knows
[3:17:20] what is in your
[3:17:21] heart and the seal is he knows them that
[3:17:25] are
[3:17:27] his he sees our
[3:17:30] works which are a definite manifestation
[3:17:32] of what
[3:17:40] lies don't deceive
[3:17:43] yourself your Works choose what is in
[3:17:45] your heart your
[3:17:48] Works they depict and make you
[3:17:50] naked what enters a mind is not what
[3:17:54] spoil but what gets out is what shows
[3:17:58] what they don't deceive
[3:18:01] yourself if you a fornicator you a
[3:18:04] fornicator if you are lying you are a li
[3:18:08] if you a thief you a
[3:18:10] Ste if you put on
[3:18:13] nakedly don't deceive yourself you have
[3:18:16] not yet
[3:18:18] the outward
[3:18:20] work they depict what you are
[3:18:28] inwardly somebody was
[3:18:33] saying some people
[3:18:38] go oh your hair should only
[3:18:43] be should only be
[3:18:46] only this
[3:18:48] one it only has first of all to be
[3:18:59] natural is
[3:19:03] it if there's any Pastor who knows itend
[3:19:09] it I will
[3:19:13] repent but what I know it is not not
[3:19:18] there it is not there whether you add
[3:19:22] something or don't add
[3:19:24] something it does not hinder you from
[3:19:28] going you don't believe that do
[3:19:31] you I'm talking to the sisters of
[3:19:34] course but I'm not done so if you're
[3:19:37] saying Amen on
[3:19:38] that so now and then they begin to say
[3:19:43] you only have to have the natural
[3:19:46] fall
[3:19:48] back because in the Book of
[3:19:51] Revelation you saw the ones who were
[3:19:53] from every
[3:19:55] age and they had their falling on
[3:19:58] their it's a beautiful s to
[3:20:01] behold but that was not a
[3:20:04] doctrine that their sisters should do
[3:20:07] that and then when they hear that when
[3:20:10] they are not changed yet in
[3:20:12] their you find a sister
[3:20:15] running Sal they
[3:20:19] call they
[3:20:31] call
[3:20:33] us come and tune
[3:20:36] me and I want the tune which is
[3:20:39] on because me I'm of class
[3:20:47] tell us the hairstyles which are
[3:20:50] own tell us the hairstyles which are
[3:21:02] own
[3:21:04] dreads dread dread not not not not not
[3:21:10] not looks like like what
[3:21:18] s Sal do
[3:21:21] me I want to look like
[3:21:27] sister I want look like
[3:21:33] wife don't worry make my
[3:21:36] hair that's all I want I want my hair to
[3:21:39] go up to
[3:21:41] the prolong it do this do
[3:21:44] that even this one even that
[3:21:47] and then your hair will be
[3:21:50] transformed is it a bad thing I don't
[3:21:53] think it is because it's natural for a
[3:21:56] woman to want to look
[3:21:58] beautiful it's not a sin but friend let
[3:22:01] me tell you
[3:22:03] something trying to stay in the middle
[3:22:04] of the
[3:22:05] line the Bible says we should not look
[3:22:09] like the
[3:22:10] world the B says that too now how will
[3:22:14] you know
[3:22:16] if you have the spirit of God in
[3:22:19] you he will tell you that is no problem
[3:22:24] but it looks like the world if the world
[3:22:26] does this do this if the world does that
[3:22:29] do this you must be
[3:22:32] different you must look different
[3:22:35] because you a
[3:22:38] Believer we must not look like
[3:22:41] them our God should not look like
[3:22:44] them let me tell you brother sister you
[3:22:47] don't need me to tell you how to
[3:22:50] look you need the holy ghost in your
[3:22:53] soul I've had sisters come to me Pastor
[3:22:58] I did this kind of hair but the Holy
[3:23:00] Ghost has been convicting me to remove
[3:23:04] everything I cannot tell them don't I
[3:23:07] will tell them follow what the Holy
[3:23:09] Ghost
[3:23:10] told I have of mine here came she did
[3:23:13] all this kind of hair that they do
[3:23:16] I don't know what happened to her but I
[3:23:19] heard my wife
[3:23:20] saying you know why did you remove
[3:23:23] it you are at school and you need say no
[3:23:27] I've decid I don't want this
[3:23:29] again no one told her
[3:23:32] not she said I want to look
[3:23:36] natural let me tell you brother sister
[3:23:39] one thing I would say I believe when the
[3:23:41] Holy Ghost is in one
[3:23:43] person he will say the same thing in
[3:23:45] another another
[3:23:49] another what I know we are in a
[3:23:52] generation where everything is
[3:23:56] artificial everything is
[3:23:58] fake fake hair fake nails fake
[3:24:03] eyelashes even fake
[3:24:05] lips fake
[3:24:07] ears when someone removes what they
[3:24:10] have you can even run away listen
[3:24:14] children of God that are put under my
[3:24:17] care I'm giving you an instruction by
[3:24:21] the power of the Holy Ghost look
[3:24:25] natural that is what I
[3:24:28] believe that's what I stand
[3:24:31] for but if you want to look like
[3:24:36] elsewhere don't you
[3:24:37] worry don't you
[3:24:39] worry but when you receive the Holy
[3:24:42] Ghost he will tell you what to
[3:24:44] do that's what I
[3:24:46] believe this message is not rotes of do
[3:24:50] and
[3:24:51] do is the power of the Holy Ghost comes
[3:24:54] in you to guide you and lead you what to
[3:24:57] do but the scripture tells us a woman
[3:25:01] should not cut a
[3:25:04] hair because
[3:25:06] hair her for her
[3:25:09] covering if she cuts her ha she should
[3:25:13] even even
[3:25:14] pray or even prophesy
[3:25:17] because she's
[3:25:19] dishonorable that's what the Bible
[3:25:22] says but most of these ties that they do
[3:25:26] they do they don't do them without
[3:25:27] cutting the
[3:25:29] hair and they don't and you can't stop
[3:25:32] it so then you have cutting you have cut
[3:25:35] your
[3:25:35] hair whatever you're doing on your
[3:25:38] hair do not cut your
[3:25:44] hair but a prophet said
[3:25:47] if a sister has no
[3:25:50] hair and maybe she wants to look
[3:25:51] beautiful
[3:25:53] or maybe she'll add something that looks
[3:25:56] like her
[3:25:58] hair and and you know just to to try and
[3:26:01] have maybe more
[3:26:02] hair I have seen women who have no hair
[3:26:06] at and you know and some of them decide
[3:26:08] to say well I'll even not put
[3:26:11] anything it's their conviction
[3:26:16] if a woman doesn't have
[3:26:17] hair it's not it's okay to put
[3:26:21] something a woman looks awkward without
[3:26:25] hair but then you know you're not going
[3:26:28] to go and put on all this kind of
[3:26:32] things that looks like a Chinese looks
[3:26:35] like this looks like
[3:26:37] that and some of you even have beautiful
[3:26:42] hair but you know you just go and put on
[3:26:44] something else
[3:26:47] let your glory
[3:26:49] shine your hair is your
[3:26:56] glory I'm sorry if I offended
[3:27:00] one I don't intend to offend I intend to
[3:27:04] give you the full C
[3:27:09] of before you before you know it
[3:27:11] something begins to cro up
[3:27:17] I want to do
[3:27:18] like come on do like what the word of
[3:27:21] God
[3:27:21] [Music]
[3:27:23] says praise
[3:27:26] God we as message
[3:27:29] Believers we believe this is our our
[3:27:33] belief system
[3:27:34] now we believe we are
[3:27:38] fearfully and wonderfully
[3:27:47] on our weddings you see sisters
[3:27:50] coming with natural
[3:27:53] look
[3:27:58] beautiful yes I'm going to pick on you
[3:28:01] sister was
[3:28:06] beautiful
[3:28:09] natural no
[3:28:11] makeup naturally
[3:28:13] beautiful tell me our girls
[3:28:18] ugly or do you want me to par them
[3:28:22] here some of you men who are not seeing
[3:28:26] you they
[3:28:28] beautiful and they naturally
[3:28:33] beautiful sisters don't convert the
[3:28:35] things of the
[3:28:38] world that is stinking before the eyes
[3:28:41] the nost of God
[3:28:44] [Music]
[3:28:46] we should be the
[3:28:49] standard praise God praise God what
[3:28:53] about a
[3:28:56] necklace oh a prophet said if your
[3:28:59] husband gives you
[3:29:02] one I don't see why it is
[3:29:06] wrong but we find
[3:29:09] sisters who are now making it a
[3:29:13] point to go and buy Bye Bye Bye Bye
[3:29:18] by they are not even
[3:29:21] married so who gave
[3:29:26] you you have a
[3:29:29] problem praise God and even the Bible
[3:29:32] says women who profess
[3:29:36] godliness who you know they
[3:29:41] godliness where is it in the book of
[3:29:42] First Peter that it will not be the
[3:29:45] outward
[3:29:50] women wearing
[3:29:54] gold and all this kind of things and
[3:29:58] everything so what does that mean is it
[3:30:01] is it wrong to Plate
[3:30:04] hair is it wrong to you know use
[3:30:07] jewelry
[3:30:09] Jew no is it wrong to put on
[3:30:14] cloes but what is it saying
[3:30:16] that if a woman is
[3:30:18] Godly she will not show her
[3:30:22] character by how nice she has
[3:30:25] dressed by how much je she
[3:30:28] has by by by how much you know by how
[3:30:31] her hair
[3:30:32] looks but it's going to be a Godly
[3:30:36] heart out of our
[3:30:38] heart having a
[3:30:41] character having the virtues of a
[3:30:44] woman I remember when I was my wife was
[3:30:46] still a
[3:30:48] fiance I want to the show up and
[3:30:50] Bo I wanted to buy I looked at this
[3:30:53] beautiful

[3:30:58] you a
[3:31:00] necklace well she was coming from
[3:31:01] another church I know
[3:31:08] what she said thank you

[3:31:13] ring and that is enough
[3:31:16] I don't want all this kind
[3:31:24] of I actually wanted to buy it for
[3:31:28] her I mean it she turned it
[3:31:33] down but I think she saved
[3:31:35] me because once they
[3:31:39] start finishing is very
[3:31:43] difficult we would have been having
[3:31:47] budget every week every
[3:31:50] mon what when you are

[3:32:08] ornaments will not be the outward
[3:32:11] oraments but will be of the heart
[3:32:16] praise God does it mean the outward ones
[3:32:18] are
[3:32:20] sinful no but all The Godly
[3:32:23] women not after the

[3:32:29] inside and you brother you not see the
[3:32:31] outside
[3:32:33] Beauty you
[3:32:36] the it comes to a place where a
[3:32:40] Believer will be different from the
[3:32:43] work you know when you're working not
[3:32:46] even the message of by way
[3:32:48] only there are some denominations which
[3:32:50] have kept that
[3:32:53] standard and when you
[3:32:55] walking you can
[3:32:58] see this one is different are you a
[3:33:01] Christian yes the way they talk the way
[3:33:06] they

[3:33:10] presence of
[3:33:12] God I believe the bride of Christ should

[3:33:19] manifest
[3:33:22] Christ praise God he sees our
[3:33:26] works which are a definite manifestation
[3:33:29] of what lies within
[3:33:33] us it is out of the heart that proceeds
[3:33:37] either righteousness or
[3:33:40] wickedness our motives our purposes all
[3:33:44] are known unto him as he watches every
[3:33:49] action and every action every word shall
[3:33:54] be brought into
[3:33:55] judgment when they accounting for our
[3:33:59] lives there was no fear of God before
[3:34:01] the fal
[3:34:05] Vine they for
[3:34:08] it but when you receive the Holy Ghost
[3:34:12] because you're the True Vine you will
[3:34:15] have the fear of
[3:34:18] God hallelujah hallelujah you're going
[3:34:21] to give an
[3:34:23] account don't do things because others
[3:34:25] do
[3:34:28] them what does the Holy Spirit
[3:34:31] speak praise
[3:34:35] God I've seen young people for instance
[3:34:38] I give you an
[3:34:40] example who have no
[3:34:43] smartphones and others have
[3:34:48] and they are
[3:34:49] okay they very spiritual they good in

[3:35:46] if the B says if one eye causes you to
[3:35:54] see literally means certain things in
[3:35:57] this
[3:35:59] life causes you to be away from
[3:36:03] God they profane and

[3:37:20] me shall come and that come to me I will
[3:37:26] know how do you come to him by
[3:37:29] submitting yourself to the
[3:37:31] word for I came down from
[3:37:34] heaven not to do my own will but the
[3:37:38] will of him
[3:37:39] that and this is the Father's
[3:37:42] will what is the Father's will
[3:37:45] that

[3:38:13] and this is the will of him that sent me
[3:38:16] everyone which see the
[3:38:19] son how do you see the son by receiving
[3:38:23] a revelation of the
[3:38:25] word and him that believeth on him may
[3:38:29] have everlasting
[3:38:31] life and I will raise him up at the
[3:38:34] last praise the
[3:38:37] Lord the last scripture here in Matthew
[3:38:40] 13 He says again the Kingdom of Heaven
[3:38:43] is like unto a NE
[3:38:46] that was cast into the
[3:38:48] sea and gathered of every
[3:38:51] kind which when it was
[3:38:53] full they drew to
[3:38:55] Shore and sat down and gathered the good
[3:38:59] into the
[3:39:01] vessels but cast the B
[3:39:03] away so shall it be at the end of the
[3:39:07] world the angel shall come
[3:39:10] forth and thece the wicked from among
[3:39:14] and S the wicked from among the just
[3:39:21] already the pre of the
[3:39:24] go what are they doing they are curing
[3:39:27] the
[3:39:29] fishing
[3:39:31] Hallelujah
[3:39:33] Hallelujah by the word of
[3:39:36] God
[3:39:37] separating the wicked from
[3:39:40] the that will come is already happening
[3:39:45] cast them into the furnace of the of
[3:39:48] fire there shall be waiting and nashing
[3:39:53] of let me tell you friends the gospel
[3:39:57] has been cast
[3:39:59] out into the sea of the
[3:40:02] world and as it is being pulled
[3:40:06] out you know those who are
[3:40:09] just are being separated from the
[3:40:12] wicked but let me ask you who are the
[3:40:16] just the Bible says the
[3:40:19] just shall
[3:40:21] live by
[3:40:23] faith faith in what faith in the
[3:40:29] word the more you believe in the word
[3:40:32] you are
[3:40:33] Justified you are Justified not because
[3:40:37] of your works but because of your faith
[3:40:40] in
[3:40:42] the and he says the foundation of God
[3:40:48] stands he knows them that are
[3:40:52] is he will lose none of them he will not
[3:40:56] lose any of them that's why as a pastor
[3:41:00] people keep coming people keep going
[3:41:02] some and we keep preaching
[3:41:05] anyhow because we know that none can
[3:41:09] go if they are meant to
[3:41:12] be the father will lose n
[3:41:17] he will not lose me he will not lose you

[3:44:05] today praise God maybe he wanted me to
[3:44:09] speak so I can give him that prophetic
[3:44:13] [Music]
[3:44:15] Believers were are not laboring for
[3:44:18] Paul or for an
[3:44:21] organization they weren't committed to
[3:44:25] programs and
[3:44:27] institutions whereby they built up
[3:44:30] Holdings of
[3:44:32] value we are not laboring for a
[3:44:34] man we are not laboring for an
[3:44:37] organization we don't have a
[3:44:39] religion we are laboring for the
[3:44:44] Lord they worked for the Lord they were
[3:44:47] his servants not the Pawns of an
[3:44:51] organization they didn't go to church on
[3:44:53] Sunday and talk about the name and then
[3:44:56] forget the rest of the
[3:45:01] week they didn't give liap service to
[3:45:04] that
[3:45:05] name no sir it was their
[3:45:09] Liv that we
[3:45:12] given their lives
[3:45:17] friends I want to tell you today
[3:45:20] this it's a
[3:45:23] confession I've given my
[3:45:25] life there are many things I could do in
[3:45:29] life and I'm sure I would
[3:45:32] Prosper but I decided to give my
[3:45:37] life to the cause of this
[3:45:40] message if it is something worth dying
[3:45:43] for
[3:45:45] it is worth leing
[3:45:48] for we ought to give our
[3:45:52] life not just to talk about
[3:45:54] it and then we go leave something
[3:45:59] else God help
[3:46:05] us it's a
[3:46:09] choice even as Ministers of the
[3:46:13] Gospel there are many things we we we
[3:46:16] would have
[3:46:17] done but choices we
[3:46:22] make and they did they did that in that
[3:46:26] name in that name they
[3:46:28] acted but if they could not act in that
[3:46:33] name then they refrain from
[3:46:38] AC if my preaching is not going to be in
[3:46:40] the
[3:46:42] name then I don't need to preach
[3:46:45] if my life is not going to accompany
[3:46:50] mym I don't want to
[3:46:52] pre I want my
[3:46:54] life and my
[3:46:57] sermons to be aligned
[3:46:59] together our
[3:47:01] life to be aligned with what we
[3:47:05] confess let the world behold
[3:47:07] us and see us as different

[3:47:34] the waiting to get
[3:47:37] in and tear
[3:47:40] down but the Saints
[3:47:43] stood they stood the test and the
[3:47:48] word and they kept that
