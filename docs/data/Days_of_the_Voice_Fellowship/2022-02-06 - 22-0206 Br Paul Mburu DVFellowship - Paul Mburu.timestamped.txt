[18:22] i'm so much
[18:24] glad to be in front of

[18:30] it will come from
[18:32] uh number 205
[18:36] near the cross that's the head of the
[18:39] soul
[18:40] i'm so much humbled for the pressure
[18:43] that
[18:44] spoke to us last sunday
[18:47] in fact i doubt whether there is any
[18:49] other person
[18:51] that was
[18:52] that the word
[18:54] went to apart from me
[18:57] no
[18:58] the preacher said
[19:00] there is someone i don't know whether he
[19:02] brought it that way but that is what i
[19:04] got in my mind
[19:05] you didn't want to come to church
[19:08] but you were first
[19:10] and you are being forced by the spirit
[19:12] of the lord
[19:15] let me give a bit of that you know
[19:17] sometime back at school because when i
[19:20] was
[19:21] uh i was one of the leaders in the
[19:24] ministry
[19:25] and definitely when things would not
[19:27] work out well i would wake up early at
[19:30] around four five six there i go pray
[19:33] somewhere then i leave the service to go
[19:36] at least up to 10 then afterwards i
[19:38] followed them up or at times i would
[19:40] just
[19:41] say i'm not going to change like i told
[19:44] brother solomon that sunday man i'm not
[19:47] coming to church i might not come to
[19:48] church when i felt my heart was really
[19:51] damaged i felt i had a lot of things on
[19:54] my face that i would not come and face
[19:57] the brethren here
[19:59] so when the
[20:01] the preacher spoke
[20:02] i felt inside me but the word hills i
[20:06] had a lot of wounds i cannot express all
[20:08] that but really i got delivered
[20:12] i thought maybe it was just
[20:15] a mere say i tried turning you're not
[20:18] checking myself as i was sitting there
[20:21] i i didn't expect myself to have gone
[20:23] back the way really i was free
[20:27] but i want to give glory unto god
[20:28] because he delivered me
[20:34] [Music]
[20:36] and for that matter i'll just take this
[20:38] moment to worship him
[20:40] in this song
[20:43] jesus keep me near
[20:49] [Music]
[21:01] from
[21:02] calvary's mountain
[21:06] jesus keep me near the cross
[21:12] there are precious
[21:20] [Music]

[2:18:23] cannot break through what do we achieve
[2:18:25] to each one watching to achieve trolling
[2:18:28] last fall i dreamed i was lost in white
[2:18:31] sands
[2:18:35] and it was getting dark i don't want to
[2:18:37] worry
[2:18:38] i couldn't find my way
[2:18:41] so this dream has stayed with me since
[2:18:44] that last time
[2:18:48] and now i am as one cropping in darkness
[2:19:04] is
[2:19:32] that something is running through your
[2:19:34] family
[2:19:39] sort of bondage
[2:19:42] that you cannot be able to breakthrough
[2:20:06] you let something happen to you that's
[2:20:08] made you nervous
[2:20:14] here
[2:21:11] prophet when a catholic sin they cannot
[2:21:13] be to bring a message of deliverance

[2:23:29] your dream proves by the interpretation
[2:23:31] that you are in white sun
[2:23:37] everything is all right
[2:23:41] so the problem it is
[2:23:44] yourself

[3:01:11] i really want to appreciate you
[3:01:14] we are a small fellowship truly uh
[3:01:17] but i should say that god is doing
[3:01:19] miracles
[3:01:22] that should really make us happy and we
[3:01:24] should be crying
[3:01:26] amen amen
[3:01:29] uh you know little by little but we see
[3:01:31] where we are going we want
[3:01:36] and so
[3:01:38] i i okay i know that there are probably
[3:01:40] those who have what's brother joel
[3:01:42] brother joe anyone
[3:01:44] do you have i don't know if you have any
[3:01:46] more payments what i'm going to read
[3:01:49] about
[3:01:51] is not including what probably has
[3:01:53] already been done in this service
[3:01:56] so i don't know when i illustrate how
[3:01:58] much it was but as of now it is we have
[3:02:01] point eight five two five hundred uh
[3:02:03] millions
[3:02:26] amen amen
[3:02:28] and uh
[3:02:31] these um
[3:02:35] i know we were looking for 150 millions
[3:02:40] and that's not about
[3:02:51] but i also know there are some who have
[3:02:52] not fulfilled their pledges
[3:02:56] please
[3:03:11] just fulfill the pledge we took his away
[3:03:13] immobile because you pledged unto the
[3:03:15] lord gowanga where you are educated not
[3:03:17] to the church
[3:03:19] unto the lord neherich
[3:03:20] and we are going to buy this land
[3:03:25] i said we are going to buy this ok
[3:03:29] it may seem impossible
[3:03:38] whether the devil likes it or not
[3:03:42] we have had the word
[3:03:46] give me my mountain
[3:03:49] and we should also possess our land
[3:04:07] and so uh we have been still looking at
[3:04:10] several pieces of land
[3:04:14] and i noticed we could even get one
[3:04:15] cheaper by the way no yeah
[3:04:18] we could get one cheaper
[3:04:33] those areas
[3:04:37] it's a bit cheaper
[3:04:41] than you so um
[3:04:44] i believe that uh if we increase our
[3:04:47] efforts the kids are single to
[3:05:00] uh
[3:05:01] yes brother i love that amen i
[3:05:49] i have several plans nina plan but i'm
[3:05:52] waiting upon the lord i don't want to
[3:05:53] just speak something on the pulpit that
[3:05:55] is not yet fully
[3:05:57] uh
[3:05:59] fully thought through and i've not also
[3:06:00] met the ministers
[3:06:09] so but that's what i believe
[3:06:12] amen amen so we are about to hit seven
[3:06:14] million
[3:06:16] millionaires from seven we shall eat ten
[3:06:18] million
[3:06:19] dollars
[3:06:20] in a month we should hit 10 million at
[3:06:22] least
[3:06:26] about
[3:06:40] and uh
[3:06:42] from there
[3:06:44] i believe once we are above 10 between
[3:06:47] our super community there is a time when
[3:06:48] we are saying we have 58 000.
[3:07:06] amen amen i don't want you to let down

[3:07:23] but
[3:07:25] but to them building beautiful churches
[3:07:28] and owning land meant
