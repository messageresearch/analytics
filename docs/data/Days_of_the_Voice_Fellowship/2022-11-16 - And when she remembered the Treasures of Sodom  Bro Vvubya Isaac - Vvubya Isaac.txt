foundation of the world he wanted us to know this truth though we never knew about it he knew that we were his yeah Hallelujah lingering in the world but then by his grace we've had to come out according to how we wanted but it was by his grace that's why the Bible says we are saved by his grace and each moment we should or we should live in America knowing that we are living by his grace praise God hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said or says the book of Romans Chapter 14 verse 7 foreign [Music] praise God Hallelujah Hallelujah from getting it from the chapter we read in the Book of Genesis chapter 19. when you start with the verse 1. you will read it in your own time because of time we shall take some little verses Angels Came From Heaven with God absolutely [Music] it wasn't according to God's willing you identify students so they went together Hallelujah and they reached somewhere and then a grudge Rose among them and then he told him so the Bible says when Lord looked like this he saw a beautiful plane now foreign foreign Hallelujah so they worked they journeyed together Hallelujah God never talk to Abraham done something which displeased God he did something which was out of God's way that is The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ and it was known until Abraham separated himself with the Lord that is when we find chapter 19 God is coming and visit Abraham Hallelujah we don't have time but when you go in chapter 18. that is understanding rising up between Abraham [Music] that is what God calls you today [Music] [Music] Hallelujah it was just one day a voice came and told him Abraham leave this land of Allah [Music] separated him from the from his kindness it is the same thing some of us we are coming from families foreign [Music] God decided to destroy these cities but before destroying them uh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign Jesus Christ let us go praise God we'll come attended us the way let us uh just go a little uh in verse 17 of chapter 18. shall I hid from Abraham that which I do now seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations 20 and the Lord said Captain America because the Cry of Sodom and Gomer is great because their sin is very Grievous I will go down now and see whether they have done all together according to the cryos [Music] which is come unto me and if not I will know praise God [Music] with thou also destroyed it right yes so when God disclosed about his plan towards Sodom and gomola to Abraham is fine that I have my brother there his family to plead for Lotus family [Music] because he thought that maybe a lot by now is having a big group group of people maybe he's having a family and his inilos praise God hallelujah so he pleaded Universe within the city now this was Abraham physically with that also destroy a non-spray the place for the 50 righteous that are thereiness that be far from thee now after this select the righteous with the wicked right here should be as the wicked that be far from shall not judge of All Shall Not the judge of all the Earth do right [Music] Sonoma [Music] then I will spare all the place for their sakes now this was Abraham pleading for the Saints or for the righteous ones or the cities of Sodom and gomoran because his brother was in Sodom he knew it very well and by now he thought maybe he's having his wife his children and his in-laws praise God so he kept on breeding yeah just continue Abraham answered and said behold now I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord which I am but dust and Ashes foreign [Music] he came to uh verse 32 and he said oh let you know the Lord be angry I'll speak yet but this once shall be found there because he never knew very well what was the number of lotus lotus family maybe they are 45. maybe they are 30. till when he reached at number 10. praise God they even never wanted to think about God in their mind praise God so God decided to destroy these cities to get them out of the sight of the world praise God so these Angels Came In The House of Lords to seek for his family [Music] Mighty free from the destruction that was coming Lord come to them hallelujah hallelujah praise God when he welcomed them let us continue on and he said beholding out my Lord stand in now I pray you into your servante's house and I shall rise up and go on you you shall rise up and go your ways all the people from every culture foreign which came into the this night bring them out onto us that we may know them praise God now when the Angels were coming the people of Sodom we are seeing them they entered into the House of Lords so the Bible says these men of Sodom came and surrounded the House of Lords with a purpose of getting out these angels and take them for homosexuality praise God because they were the cities that turned out to be that many never wanted to sleep with their wives they wanted to sit with their fellow men praise God that's how sinful the city of sodomy foreign [Music] [Music] I have to daughters which have not known a man let me I pray you Bambi munde bring them out to you today and doing it to them as is good in your eyes for therefore came they under the shadow of my life praise God so now Lord was staying in Sodom and he knew very well the acts of men so when they constrained him let these men out and they know them Lord try to pleading an extent that he had his two daughters who are still virgins they were staying with him praise God their desires that go and God perverted [Music] an extent that even this man wrote the righteous man by in the city the only righteous one okay now even we find that lot was just a borderline believer foreign [Music] foreign let us proceed actually they even wanted to break the door to pick the Angels by force and they attempted the two praise God first thing but the many put forth their hands now when they talk about the men they are talking about the Angels but the men put forth their hand and put lot into the house [Music] on the house but small and great so that they they worried themselves to find adults foreign [Music] them out of this place you know Hallelujah now a distraction was coming God was going to bring his destruction towards the cities of Solomon cartoon but he had to send a message the warning message fast praise God Amen Hallelujah to serve whosoever shall free to the message to serve whosoever shall free to the message praise God amen hallelujah amen so he sent his angels at the hearing of the message go and tell your daughters go and tell your your friends can't tell everyone you would wish today Mighty free because obstruction is scanning praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah because destruction was going to set in a few minutes so we will destroy this place verse 13. because the Cry of them is waxing great before the face of the Lord and the Lord has sent us to destroy is a lot went out and speak unto his sons praise God hallelujah hallelujah now it meant that Lord had some other daughters because this is where his son is praise God I mean so he rushed to them and told them there is destruction that is coming forth so now again please come and we're free praise God hallelujah not went out and spoke to his sons-in-law which married his daughters get out of this place so the Lord will destroy this city and listen but he seemed as one that mocked unto him praise God it seemed as if he was mocking them but the message was going before but he seemed that though he was mocking them why because they had a lot of belongings had a lot of riches praise God so they never even thought of leaving Sodom whatever is verse 15 of the community and when the morning arose the message came first telling him take thy wife your two daughters destruction is coming soon should I go with this one I was still thinking we are saying that Hallelujah [Music] again [Music] don't even think about the treasures don't even think about the Flames you've left inside you just continue on now yeah praise God now listen verse 18. and the Lord said ah hallelujah hallelujah and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said Escape for thy life we will look not behind thee neither State thou in all the plane escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed Amino praise God hallelujah hallelujah praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ after the we are told never to look back let us go to verse 26 Hallelujah and see what Lotus wife did praise the one of the name of Jesus Christ but his wife looked back from behind him hallelujah hallelujah and she became praised in the name of Jesus Christ they went out of Sodom so Sodom Allah Hallelujah by the help of the Angels after hearing the message but the message was live out of Sodom Sodom but don't look back praise the name of Jesus Christ [Music] the Church of God foreign foreign hallelujah hallelujah verse 26 foreign but the same day that Lord went out of Sodom now it rained fire and brightest from heaven and destroyed them even thus it shall be when the son of man is revealed praise God I mean Jesus told his church yes during the days of his coming back movie said it is going to be in the same way it was in the days of sodomy praise God and we are waiting for the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and you have seen all the acts the same acts as it was in the cities of Sodom and government and these are the days that our Lord Jesus Christ talked about first that as thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed praise God in that day he which shall be upon the house and his stuff in the house very close in that day which day the day for the second coming over he which shall be upon the house and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise praise God our Lord told us that once you're good out of the world take a stomach don't even think back to the fingers of the world it will happen to be on the house don't come back to pick anything from your house as you're picking it you'll be left out praise God hallelujah and then he said if you'll be found in the field [Music] what did she do foreign foreign what God requires from you as a Believer you claim to be a Christian hallelujah hallelujah because in the first time the Bible says for this is good acceptable in the sight of Our Lord like all men to get saved but when you get foreign whatever the Bible tells you to do you do Bible when it tells you not to do you don't but you know don't say this was foreign [Music] hallelujah hallelujah praise God hallelujah now they just shall live by faith but if anyone anymore my soul shall have no pressure when you come to God when time comes and you draw back I don't know his uh he has no his soul has no pleasure in any person that draws back praise God he wants you to come out and then you go forward that is why he told the church that you remember about his wife yes because she get she got out of the city but then she looked back she received it a message but then she took half of my message she said I love this this one I want to do it but that's when I won't take it you know praise God he said remember praise God praise God the Church of God [Music] I have to run down foreign [Music] let us get there Philippians I'm a Philippi uh chapter 3 verse 13 is praise God hallelujah hallelujah it says I count not myself to have apprehended severeign [Music] there is some destruction that is soon praise God there are some Lords that are going to be saved from the cities praise God but still we are having some Lotus wives they are still looking behind praise God they received the message still they going to the world Amina Hallelujah listen what he says 1964-02 15. influences he says I think if we had the people today then there was a singer to Adam and today you know our churches who came to be Christians if they would abstain from the things of the world and live that kind of a life it would influence the younger Christians praise God but today when they let down and drinks and still try to hold their confessions praise God that puts a stumbling block in other people's way to take away music and it makes it very hard praise God now that is the problem the church has got these days the problem the church has changed some people's legs are in the world and the other one in in church he comes from boozing then he comes in church yet he says praise God but what comes to such people if they don't repent is Judgment the same without his wife received because she received the whole message then she took half of it she said this is for the pastor this is for the ministers praise God whatever God before brings judgment he has to bring a warning tonight Hallelujah I think it behooves us tonight hallelujah hallelujah for every woman knows that you are coming to judgment you might escape this is you might beat the income tax you might escape the internal revenue hallelujah hallelujah you might do one thing you might have run over the Speedy limits praise God that is certain praise God Amen it is the same judgment that came to Lord his wife she received the message but then took half of it because of the treasures she thought of the things she missed yeah she's going to miss praise God I mean she thought of her children God calls you he calls you alone praise God if your children tends to get away from the world see don't follow them your lord is to go down on your knees Saturday they might come back to the message but if you say my true my child is like this she was stumbled in this way foreign [Music] and you know I told my knee paragraph 92 and you know the voice Never Dies it never died there is somewhere it will never die science in the 20 years if they can progress as they have now they will pick up the literal voice of Jesus Christ when he was on Earth praise God hallelujah hallelujah and neither does the words that you speak yeah foreign verse verse verse 10. hey there have you got there because second Corinthians 5 yeah it says for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that he has done whether it be good with universe that is what the Bible says the Judgment seat of Christ the things we that we did in the in the body praise God hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah time comes and then they look back I said praise God by the message this evening to you from God is that you don't you should not look back hallelujah hallelujah like Lord his wife when she remember the treasures when she remembered her children then she looked back that is where judgment came away hallelujah praise God come out 10 days away hallelujah hallelujah and in this message Look Away to Jesus ah this is it says 63 trailer of 29e he says after the Earth had had a nervous frustration and see a prostration shook I'm better till the locks ring out of the mountains and Justice and the sun went down in the middle of the day Guru naku and turn the darkness is the Stars didn't come out to give its life with logs and the Earth burst forth with the laws and ripe to the temple veil and ripped the temple veil from the top to the bottom and the people running and screaming I want to never do Canada they didn't know what had taken place [Music] but it was too late he looked and believed but it was too late for him to believe what he had done had sealed his Doom yeah he had run the spear through the savior's heart it was too late I wonder how many Romans today have done the same thing and they will do the same thing you might look someday but it might look too late will come in that day and be the same way praise God hallelujah hallelujah says at the end of it all believe that this was the son of Moon come back through his body he had PS to him and that was too late for him he had had all the messages from different ministers praise God but then it was too late for him because time was over Hallelujah he had already made his judgment there was no extrus for him the same thing that happened to Lotus wife she had had a message from the two angels [Music] praise God but when she decided to intentionally turn and looked back again so when we intentionally do what the Bible tells us never to do it together praise God we might cross Mercy our way and then we might find ourselves on a judgment days in the same way what am I trying to say that they see they clearly Vindicated word like pilate and the rest of them like the Roman soldiers but are you going to wait too late to do anything about it hallelujah hallelujah he should have used the spear the other way the doors will be closed like it was in the days and then it is too late so Church of God what does god require us from once we came out of the world let us not look back like hallelujah hallelujah let us leave all the situations there that way and enjoy the treasures in the world hallelujah hallelujah though they are small so much praise God hallelujah hallelujah because it won't profit any man to eat [Music] foreign Hallelujah [Music] hallelujah hallelujah in this message sir we would see Jesus foreign look now look now look when Lord was called out of Sodom Bluetooth you people remember the story now the angel said to Lord and his wife his family don't look back and now think of that Mother's wife judgments of God her grandchildren were burning up in the judgments and she stands there yet today [Music] praise God we know that see it makes a difference when you go mean means just exactly what it says foreign ever been praise God foreign [Music] wife
