[46:04] He me
[46:06] when I
[46:08] [Music]
[46:13] go. Let us call upon him to call him.
[46:18] Our kind, tender heavenly father.
[46:23] We are so honored to be in your presence
[46:26] this
[46:28] evening. Our hearts are desperate and
[46:31] longing after
[46:34] you as a dear pant after the
[46:39] waters. We are longing for you this
[46:41] evening,
[46:43] Lord. That as we have come in your
[46:47] presence, we know that you have our
[46:49] issues taken care
[46:51] of. As we have come in your
[46:54] presence, we know you have a table
[46:58] sprayed where we are going to be
[47:00] fed. We shall go back at home
[47:04] rejoicing and we will be saying that our
[47:06] hearts burn within us.
[47:10] as the Lord spoke to us
[47:12] tonight. Father, may you grant
[47:14] that for we have come thirsting and
[47:17] desperate for
[47:19] you. We want nothing else but
[47:22] [Music]
[47:23] you. Come and have your way,
[47:26] Lord. I pray that you bless those that
[47:28] have been able to make it to church
[47:31] tonight and also those that are
[47:33] streaming by the way of the
[47:35] internet. Lord, I pray that you will
[47:37] bless us all together.
[47:40] our hearts will be filled with your
[47:42] presence and with full assurance of your
[47:45] tender care towards
[47:48] us. We appreciate you Lord as we ask
[47:50] these things in
[47:53] God. Amen. Amen.
[48:00] There's a stanza that I would like us to
[48:02] uh start with
[48:07] in the one of the songs that we've sung
[48:09] for many years.
[48:12] [Music]
[48:17] It says, "Oh great
[48:23] compassion, oh boundless
[48:25] love, all loving
[48:28] kindness, faithful and
[48:31] true, find peace and
[48:34] shelter under the
[48:36] blood and I will pass and I will pass
[48:38] over you." Can we say that together?
[48:42] Oh great
[48:44] compassion, oh boundless
[48:47] love, oh loving
[48:50] kindness, faithful and true to oh find
[48:55] peace and
[48:56] shelter and the
[48:59] blood and I will pass. I will pass over
[49:05] you when
[49:08] I when I see the blood. See the blood.
[49:13] When I when I see the blood, I see the
[49:18] blood.
[49:20] When I see the
[49:24] blood, I will pass. I will pass over
[49:29] you. Sing it again.
[49:32] Oh with
[49:34] compassion, oh boundless
[49:37] love, oh loving kind, oh faith and find
[49:44] find peace and
[49:47] shelter under the
[49:50] blood. I will pass. I will pass. I want
[49:54] us to sing that stanza one more time.
[49:57] Amen. Oh great compassion.
[50:01] Oh boundless
[50:02] love, oh loving
[50:05] kindness, faithful and true. Oh find
[50:10] peace and
[50:14] sh. Oh I will pass I will pass over you.
[50:22] [Music]
[50:23] Oh, I see. I see the
[50:29] blood. I see the blood. See the
[50:35] blood. I see the blood of the lamb. I
[50:40] will pass. I will pass
[50:45] up. Oh, wait. I see the blood. I see the
[50:50] blood. Wait.
[50:54] I see the blood. See the
[50:58] blood when I I see the
[51:02] blood. I will pass. I will pass over
[51:07] you. Give the Lord a clap of praise.
[51:12] Amen. Hallelujah. We thank God for the
[51:15] blood.
[51:18] Amen. Shall we you turn to your Bibles?
[51:20] I want to greet you all of you in the
[51:21] name of Jesus
[51:22] Christ. Uh it's good to be in the house
[51:24] of the
[51:26] Lord. Can you say amen to
[51:30] that? Um we're going to to read once
[51:33] again in the book of Lamentations.
[51:44] We're just
[51:56] uh this is
[51:58] um something that we
[52:03] read but we did not have we do not
[52:05] emphasize on these verses.
[52:10] So I just wanted to for us to go through
[52:12] them tonight.
[52:16] Um chapter 3
[52:21] 22
[52:29] 23. It is of the Lord. It is sorry. It
[52:33] is of the Lord's mercies that we are not
[52:35] consumed because his compassions fail
[52:38] not. They are new every morning. Great
[52:41] is thy faithfulness.
[52:57] Amen. You may be seated. Can I have a
[52:59] little more sound, brothers, please?
[53:04] Praise the Lord.
[53:09] Are you happy to be in the house of the
[53:10] Lord?
[53:13] Let me tell you
[53:15] friends uh there are many things that uh
[53:17] come and
[53:21] go but the Lord and his mercies endure
[53:27] forever and that's why for us um it we
[53:31] should never take it for granted to
[53:32] serve the Lord to be in his house.
[53:39] David said that he was glad when they
[53:41] told him let's go to the house of
[53:45] God. So it is a blessing to be in the
[53:47] house of
[53:48] God and whenever you get a chance like
[53:52] this you have a reason to
[53:55] rejoice because this is the reason of
[53:57] our
[53:59] being to worship him to live for
[54:02] him and to be encouraged of him.
[54:07] There is more in Christ than you have
[54:09] received
[54:11] already. You can never hear enough
[54:13] sermons to hear more enough of
[54:17] him. You can never there is more in
[54:20] him. And so there is more for you
[54:24] tonight. And I don't want you to look
[54:26] like you're
[54:27] sad. When I look at your face, I want to
[54:29] see you
[54:31] smiling. I want you to to to to look as
[54:34] if you are a true genuine
[54:37] believer. The true genuine believer is
[54:40] not defined by the situations around
[54:44] them. A true genuine believer is defined
[54:46] by the word of
[54:49] God. Amen. Amen. Are we ready for the
[54:52] word
[54:53] tonight? I just want to speak to you on
[54:56] a little subject uh that I took from the
[54:58] verses
[55:01] 22. His compassions fail not.
[55:08] Um he called it grace
[55:11] there compassion.
[55:15] It is of the Lord his mercies that we
[55:17] are not
[55:23] consumed. Okay. He call he calls it
[55:26] grace there. But I think you'll need to
[55:28] find a better word because it's not
[55:29] grace. It is um
[55:32] compassion. M so I think compassion
[55:35] you'd like to say uh is something like
[55:39] pity or or or
[55:48] sympathy sympathy compassion. Yeah you
[55:51] can call it. Amen. So the Lord it is of
[55:54] the Lord is mercy that we are not
[55:57] consumed because his compassions fail
[56:00] not.
[56:08] Because his compassions fail
[56:12] not. Tell your neighbor, his compassions
[56:15] fail
[56:17] not. They are new every morning. Great
[56:20] is thy
[56:23] faithfulness. On Sunday we talked about
[56:25] the faithfulness of
[56:28] God. But tonight I want us to talk about
[56:30] his
[56:32] compassion and he says that his
[56:34] compassions fail.
[56:37] Now you know it is of the Lord's mercies
[56:40] that we are not
[56:43] consumed. The devil would have desired
[56:46] to destroy me to destroy you.
[56:52] He planned, you
[56:53] know, he planned to bury, like I talked
[56:56] to you on Sunday, he tried to bury us in
[56:58] many
[57:02] toms. And he has tried. He keeps
[57:05] trying. And he has not tried only
[57:08] us. He has also tried those before us
[57:11] who were walking in the path that we are
[57:12] walking
[57:16] in. Right from the very beginning in the
[57:19] book of Genesis,
[57:22] There have been those three those three
[57:24] things that the enemy has always wanted
[57:27] to capture us
[57:29] in. And I I I preached on that here some
[57:32] about two years ago on these three
[57:36] things, the lust of the
[57:39] eyes, the lust of the flesh, and the
[57:42] pride of life.
[57:44] These have become tombs or
[57:47] graves for many
[57:50] Christians. Buried in the last of the
[57:53] eyes, buried in the lust of the
[57:56] flesh, buried in the pride of
[57:58] life. And each of these things is
[58:03] different. And we we find it in the book
[58:06] of
[58:07] Genesis. That's what that tree was.
[58:11] it it was you know it is defined as a
[58:13] tree that would make one
[58:16] [Music]
[58:17] wise and good for food and and good for
[58:21] the
[58:21] eyes. So you see those three things are
[58:24] there
[58:25] still and when we come later on Jesus
[58:29] also is
[58:32] first with the same three
[58:35] temptations tonight I'm not talking
[58:37] about
[58:38] those but maybe just for a little
[58:40] highlight for
[58:41] you then Jesus when he is tempted by
[58:44] these three
[58:46] things because he was God he
[58:49] overcame you remember how the enemy
[58:52] tempted him and wanted to bury him in
[58:54] the lust for
[58:58] food and the lust of the flesh. You see,
[59:01] and also you wanted to bury him in the
[59:03] lust of the
[59:05] eyes. When he told him,
[59:07] see, all these things you see are
[59:10] mine. But if you bow down and worship
[59:13] me, I give it to you. What was that? It
[59:17] was the last of the eyes. But you see,
[59:19] Jesus overcame that, too.
[59:22] He overcame the lust of the flesh when
[59:24] he said you come do not tempt the Lord
[59:26] thy
[59:27] God. And you know then then the devil
[59:30] changed and he said he took him to the
[59:32] high
[59:33] pinnacle. And for your information it
[59:36] was not Jesus and the devil walking side
[59:37] by
[59:40] side. Sometimes you want to do
[59:43] imagery. It was not Jesus and the devil
[59:46] walking side by side.
[59:49] It was only Jesus but the devil coming
[59:52] in his
[59:54] mind. The same way he comes to you every
[59:57] day is the same way he attacked
[1:00:00] Jesus. And the same way Jesus overcame
[1:00:03] him is the same way we are to overcome
[1:00:07] him and so he took him to the high
[1:00:11] pinnacle. So what was that? Jesus was
[1:00:14] being tempted.
[1:00:17] Where was Satan?
[1:00:18] in his
[1:00:21] mind. So Jesus will began walking
[1:00:24] and went to the high pinnacle
[1:00:28] and Satan told him jump. Didn't he
[1:00:32] promise in his word that he would send
[1:00:35] angels to catch you that you not even
[1:00:38] dash your foot against a
[1:00:40] stone? But you see, he overcame that
[1:00:43] too. He never jumped. That was the pride
[1:00:46] of life.
[1:00:47] Friends, I tell you, Jesus overcame
[1:00:49] every one of these tombs and and
[1:00:52] whatever that the devil wanted to bury
[1:00:53] him
[1:00:57] in. And then he thought he had overcame
[1:01:00] him with
[1:01:02] death. But even in death, Jesus was
[1:01:06] still
[1:01:07] victorious because when he died, he
[1:01:09] still rose
[1:01:10] again. I am so glad we serve a risen
[1:01:13] savior.
[1:01:15] I'm so glad we serve a living
[1:01:17] God. And the Bible says his compassion
[1:01:20] fail
[1:01:22] not. It is of the Lord's mercies we were
[1:01:25] not
[1:01:27] consumed. Meaning we too might have been
[1:01:31] consumed like the many in the world are
[1:01:33] consumed by these
[1:01:36] things. But it is of the Lord's mercies
[1:01:38] you are not
[1:01:40] consumed. It is of the Lord's mercies I
[1:01:43] am not consumed.
[1:01:46] In Malachi 3:6 says, "For I am the
[1:01:49] Lord. I change not." Therefore, ye sons
[1:01:53] of Jacob are not
[1:01:56] consumed. Don't worry about what you're
[1:01:58] going through right
[1:01:59] now. Amen. He says, "I am the Lord. I
[1:02:04] change not." Meaning, because of who you
[1:02:07] are, you will not be
[1:02:10] consumed. You are sons of Jacob because
[1:02:13] you
[1:02:14] But I want to call you not sons of
[1:02:17] Jacob but sons of God because you are
[1:02:20] sons of God. You are not
[1:02:24] consumed. Amen. A believer stands in
[1:02:26] that
[1:02:28] shity knowing I cannot be
[1:02:32] [Music]
[1:02:33] consumed. That's what David was walking
[1:02:37] in. As he saw the things he was going
[1:02:41] through, as he saw what he had gone
[1:02:43] through in his
[1:02:44] life, then he began singing or he began
[1:02:48] rehearsing those
[1:02:49] words. And we have sung this. We have
[1:02:52] read this psalm many
[1:02:54] times. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall
[1:02:58] not want. Amen. Just take your Bible and
[1:03:01] read it with me if you can.
[1:03:04] Praise the name of the Lord. He maketh
[1:03:08] me to lie down in green
[1:03:10] pastures. He leadth me beside the still
[1:03:14] waters. Are you there? I think we have
[1:03:16] the words here, brother.
[1:03:18] I'd like us to read these words
[1:03:20] together and remind ourselves of these
[1:03:24] things. If you're streaming, do the same
[1:03:26] thing with
[1:03:28] us. Psalms 23.
[1:03:34] The Lord is my shepherd.
[1:03:37] Are you there? 1 2 3 go. The Lord is my
[1:03:40] shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me
[1:03:44] to lie down in green pastures. He leadth
[1:03:47] me beside a still waters. He restoreth
[1:03:50] my soul. He leadth me in the path of
[1:03:52] righteousness for his name's sake. Yeah.
[1:03:56] Though I walk through the valley of the
[1:03:57] shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
[1:04:00] For thou art with me, thy road and thy
[1:04:03] staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a
[1:04:06] table before me in the presence of my
[1:04:08] enemies. Thou anointest my head with
[1:04:10] oil. My cup runth over. Surely goodness
[1:04:14] and mercies shall follow me all the days
[1:04:17] of my life. And I will dwell in the
[1:04:19] house of the Lord
[1:04:21] forever. This was a
[1:04:23] man that had revelation on who he
[1:04:28] was. Amen. He said, "Though I walk
[1:04:30] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:04:32] death,
[1:04:35] I will fear no
[1:04:37] evil. Our adversary seeks to devour
[1:04:42] us. But you see, if you are a true
[1:04:45] genuine
[1:04:47] believer, you will always fear no
[1:04:50] evil. Does it mean evil will never
[1:04:53] come? Evil will come. Does it mean
[1:04:56] temptation will never come? Temptation
[1:04:59] will come every day. But you have no
[1:05:02] fear.
[1:05:03] You have no fear for those
[1:05:05] things. Why? Because you know where you
[1:05:07] are
[1:05:08] standing. I want you to see what uh
[1:05:11] Peter spoke in in 1 Peter 5. He says,
[1:05:14] "Humble yourselves there for the mighty
[1:05:16] hand of
[1:05:19] God that he may exalt you in due
[1:05:23] time, casting all your care upon
[1:05:28] him. For he carth for
[1:05:31] you. He carth for you. Be sober. Be
[1:05:37] vigilant because your adversary the
[1:05:41] devil as a roaring
[1:05:44] lion walketh
[1:05:47] about seeking whom he may
[1:05:50] devour whom resist steadfast steady in
[1:05:54] the
[1:05:56] faith. Brethren, we have to remain
[1:05:59] steady in the faith.
[1:06:02] You know what steady
[1:06:04] means? Steady means
[1:06:08] unshakable. Things come and just hit on
[1:06:11] you and go
[1:06:13] away, but you remain there like a rock
[1:06:15] of
[1:06:17] ages. Jesus is the rock of ages.
[1:06:21] He was hit by
[1:06:22] everything, but he remained
[1:06:25] there. We don't serve God when we happy
[1:06:28] because good things are happening in our
[1:06:30] lives.
[1:06:33] We are happy to serve the Lord because
[1:06:35] God is uh is our fountain of
[1:06:42] life and is our foundation where we
[1:06:46] stand. So the source of our
[1:06:50] life you
[1:06:51] know life or that life is unending.
[1:06:58] You know people in the world are happy
[1:07:00] because of
[1:07:03] situations and they are sad because of
[1:07:08] situations. If you think good things
[1:07:10] have happened that day, oh this day has
[1:07:12] been
[1:07:14] good. But if things have happened that
[1:07:17] have not been good for you, you you even
[1:07:19] don't want to
[1:07:22] pray. You don't even want to come to
[1:07:24] church. Even when you come, you look as
[1:07:27] if someone has slapped
[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:30] you. What is it, brother? Things have
[1:07:32] not been well. Let me hear and see if
[1:07:35] the preacher will say
[1:07:37] something me and I feel
[1:07:39] better. You don't know who you are. But
[1:07:42] if you know who you are, you are going
[1:07:44] to stand there as a rock of ages.
[1:07:48] things will just knock on you and fall
[1:07:50] aside because you know who you are. It
[1:07:54] is because of who I
[1:07:56] am that has made me to remain
[1:08:01] standing. Needs will
[1:08:04] come and they
[1:08:07] go. Temptations will come and they will
[1:08:11] go. Time will come and it will go.
[1:08:16] People will come and they will go. Money
[1:08:19] will come and it will go. School will
[1:08:22] come and it will go. Things will come
[1:08:26] and they will go. Houses will come and
[1:08:29] they will go. I I'm telling you, things
[1:08:32] change. Time is filled with swift
[1:08:37] transition. And friends, you cannot rely
[1:08:39] on
[1:08:41] things. You cannot put your faith in
[1:08:43] things.
[1:08:46] You see whether you are blessed or not
[1:08:49] blessed, whether you are you have
[1:08:51] received your prayer or you have
[1:08:53] not, whether you are healed or you are
[1:08:56] not, you have to stand there as a solid
[1:08:59] rock of
[1:09:01] ages. The Bible says be
[1:09:04] sober, be
[1:09:06] vigilant. By the way, this is how you
[1:09:08] are able to know a true genuine
[1:09:12] believer. Amen. When you are going
[1:09:14] through the storms of
[1:09:16] life, you know, but you you are holding
[1:09:19] on, you are not holding on the
[1:09:22] boat. It is the anchor holding
[1:09:25] you. There is an anchor that every ship
[1:09:29] has. When the waves
[1:09:32] come to beat the
[1:09:34] ship, you know, they will throw that
[1:09:36] anchor and that anchor will
[1:09:39] hold. So the storms will beat the sheep.
[1:09:43] But the sheep will remain
[1:09:45] standing because of that anchor because
[1:09:49] of that anchor. If a sheep has no
[1:09:52] anchor, it will it will just drown. But
[1:09:55] you are not drowning because the anchor
[1:09:59] holds. It is of the Lord his
[1:10:02] mercies. We are not consumed. What are
[1:10:05] his mercies? His mercies are the anchor
[1:10:08] to our soul.
[1:10:12] Be vigilant because your adversary, the
[1:10:18] devil, your adversary is not your
[1:10:21] husband. He's not your wife. He's not
[1:10:24] your enemy. It's not your friend. Your
[1:10:27] adversary is the
[1:10:29] devil. We are contending with the
[1:10:32] devil. Don't leave the ring. Stay in the
[1:10:36] ring. Stay in the battle. And you see,
[1:10:39] you're not fighting with your brother,
[1:10:40] with your sisters, with your
[1:10:43] friends. You are fighting with the
[1:10:47] devil. Stay in the
[1:10:49] ring. You see, the Bible says your
[1:10:52] adversary is the what?
[1:10:55] The
[1:10:57] devil. He is as a roaring
[1:11:01] lion. He's not a lowering
[1:11:04] lion. He is as a roaring lion.
[1:11:09] He is not a roaring
[1:11:11] lion. Jesus is the roaring lion. The
[1:11:15] Bible calls him the lion of the tribe of
[1:11:17] Judah. And I said he has
[1:11:22] prevailed. Amen. But we see that the
[1:11:26] devil behaves as a roaring lion.
[1:11:32] He wants to scare you.
[1:11:34] He wants to threaten you.
[1:11:37] But do not accept to be
[1:11:39] threatened. Do not accept to be
[1:11:42] moved. Don't look at me as if I'm
[1:11:44] preaching to a
[1:11:46] rock. Say amen to the
[1:11:51] word. Amen. Praise the name of the
[1:11:55] Lord. He is as a roaring
[1:11:59] lion. He walketh
[1:12:02] about seeking whom he may devour.
[1:12:07] whom resist steadfast in the
[1:12:12] faith, steadfast in the
[1:12:15] faith, knowing that the same afflictions
[1:12:18] are accomplished in your brethren that
[1:12:21] are in the
[1:12:24] [Music]
[1:12:27] world. Praise the name of the Lord. The
[1:12:30] same
[1:12:31] afflictions that are afflicting your
[1:12:34] brothers that are in the
[1:12:36] world are the same afflictions
[1:12:39] afflicting. What is your
[1:12:41] affliction? Don't think it is only you
[1:12:44] going through what you're going
[1:12:45] through. Others in the world that are
[1:12:49] believers are going through the same
[1:12:52] thing. Some
[1:12:54] things what is your problem?
[1:12:58] Some some people want to always make
[1:13:00] others feel that they are the only one
[1:13:05] suffering. There is others going through
[1:13:08] the same suffering you're going
[1:13:10] through. The Bible said there are
[1:13:14] others other brethren in the world that
[1:13:17] are going through the same
[1:13:18] [Music]
[1:13:19] affliction. That's why he said resist
[1:13:21] the
[1:13:23] devil but be
[1:13:25] steady in the
[1:13:27] faith.
[1:13:33] Amen. Stand steady without
[1:13:37] wavering. Tell your neighbor
[1:13:40] not stand
[1:13:43] still. Hold on to the rock of ages.
[1:13:46] Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. I'm
[1:13:50] here to tell you, brethren, we are going
[1:13:53] to wither the
[1:13:54] storm. You are going to wither the
[1:13:57] storm. Amen. We we sang a song here.
[1:14:00] He's the master of the
[1:14:03] wind. We are going to weather this storm
[1:14:05] of
[1:14:07] life. Oh, I will be so happy, brother.
[1:14:11] when we are beyond a storm
[1:14:14] and I will meet you and you will meet me
[1:14:17] and we shall see each other and amen we
[1:14:21] shall have
[1:14:23] overcome. I will rejoice and you will
[1:14:25] rejoice. I will hug you and you will hug
[1:14:28] me including you sisters who shall hug
[1:14:31] one
[1:14:32] another because you would have overcome
[1:14:34] the storms of
[1:14:36] life. I am so glad I'm going to go over
[1:14:38] there.
[1:14:40] I cannot wait to go over there across
[1:14:43] the bridge.
[1:14:46] But for now, I have to resist the devil
[1:14:50] steadfast in the
[1:14:54] faith. But the God of all
[1:14:57] grace, who has called us unto his
[1:15:00] eternal glory by Christ
[1:15:04] Jesus, after that ye have suffered a
[1:15:07] while,
[1:15:09] After that you have suffered a
[1:15:12] while make you
[1:15:16] perfect. Amen.
[1:15:18] Amen. You accept to suffer a little
[1:15:22] while. Don't cuss
[1:15:25] Jesus. Love Jesus more in your
[1:15:29] trial. Love Jesus more in the storm.
[1:15:34] love Jesus more in the
[1:15:37] problems because I will tell you he's a
[1:15:39] compassionate
[1:15:42] friend. He understands where no one
[1:15:46] understands. He feels you more than
[1:15:48] anyone feels
[1:15:50] you. He's a compassionate
[1:15:54] friend. Amen. And after you have
[1:15:56] suffered a
[1:15:58] while, he is going to perfect you. He is
[1:16:01] going to establish you.
[1:16:04] He's going to strengthen you and he's
[1:16:06] going to settle you. He's going to
[1:16:09] settle you.
[1:16:10] Amen. Amen. Amen. He's going to settle
[1:16:14] you.
[1:16:16] To him be glory and dominion
[1:16:22] forever. That's why we should allow him
[1:16:24] to have dominion.
[1:16:28] Dominion in our life.
[1:16:30] Dominion in our life.
[1:16:33] You know until you get to that place
[1:16:36] where you understand you are the
[1:16:38] property of
[1:16:40] Jesus you will never have him to have
[1:16:44] dominion. I am his
[1:16:47] property. I am his. Let him do with me
[1:16:50] whatever he
[1:16:52] desires. I am willing to serve him. In
[1:16:56] suffering I will serve him in death. I
[1:16:59] will serve him in hell. I will serve
[1:17:01] him.
[1:17:03] If the devil scares me, I'll take you to
[1:17:06] hell. Even in hell, I would serve
[1:17:09] you. That's what brother Bam said that
[1:17:12] he would rather be found in
[1:17:15] heaven, you know, as a
[1:17:20] dat. It's not about self glory and
[1:17:23] lifting
[1:17:25] yourself. And wherever you
[1:17:27] go, you are going to serve him. If the
[1:17:31] devil scares you to take you to
[1:17:33] hell that should not threaten
[1:17:36] you. I am his
[1:17:38] property. If he has sinned, that's where
[1:17:40] he should take
[1:17:42] me that I should go and there for his
[1:17:46] glory. I'll go there for his glory. Then
[1:17:49] the devil will be out of
[1:17:54] ammunition. He cannot scare you with
[1:17:56] anything.
[1:17:59] He cannot scare you with
[1:18:01] anything. Meaning a believer is such a
[1:18:04] person that knows no
[1:18:08] fear. What is your fear? It is nothing
[1:18:12] before
[1:18:13] God. Amen. God said he will settle
[1:18:18] you. He will strengthen you. He will
[1:18:21] establish you. He will perfect you.
[1:18:24] Amen. And let him have dominion in your
[1:18:27] life.
[1:18:30] Hallelujah.
[1:18:32] Whatever he wants to do with you.
[1:18:35] And many times he takes us through hell
[1:18:36] on this
[1:18:39] earth and you feel like you're
[1:18:42] forsaken and you feel like no one
[1:18:44] understands what you're going
[1:18:45] through. Many times, many times
[1:18:49] believers think that a believer's
[1:18:50] journey is going to be very
[1:18:56] smooth. No, the Christian journey is the
[1:18:59] most rough
[1:19:02] journey. Because he is molding
[1:19:05] us for something
[1:19:08] better. I don't know about you, but he's
[1:19:10] molding
[1:19:12] me. I have a better home beyond the
[1:19:14] reason.
[1:19:17] our wealth is not supposed to be here on
[1:19:21] earth. Whatever we receive
[1:19:23] here down
[1:19:26] payment but what we are going to receive
[1:19:28] our payment our
[1:19:32] reward is beyond the
[1:19:37] reward and he says his compassions fail
[1:19:40] not.
[1:19:43] Now compassion in itself means
[1:19:45] sympathetic
[1:19:50] pity and and concern for the sufferings
[1:19:53] or misfortunes of
[1:19:56] [Music]
[1:19:58] others. Oh, when someone loses a loved
[1:20:02] one, oh
[1:20:05] sorry, you know, you're having
[1:20:06] compassion for
[1:20:09] them. Someone's house is burned. You
[1:20:11] know you, oh sorry. And then you bring
[1:20:15] money and oh sorry, oh sorry, sorry. If
[1:20:20] someone has been hurt by someone and you
[1:20:24] know you just come and maybe hug them or
[1:20:26] tap them on the shoulder, say sorry,
[1:20:28] sorry or maybe cry on for them. That is
[1:20:35] compassion. You feel for someone
[1:20:41] Now the Bible says
[1:20:44] here that his
[1:20:47] compassions they fail
[1:20:50] not.
[1:20:52] Now it is not exactly the way we think
[1:20:54] our human compassion is. But let's let's
[1:20:56] carry on.
[1:21:00] I want us to see the kind of compassion
[1:21:03] that he's talking
[1:21:05] about that does not
[1:21:07] fail because the compassion of Jesus
[1:21:10] does not
[1:21:12] fail. Whoever he has compassion
[1:21:15] on, he will settle them. He will
[1:21:18] establish them. He will strengthen them.
[1:21:21] He perfect
[1:21:22] them after they have suffered. He will
[1:21:26] have compassion upon them.
[1:21:28] And then he will make you know like on
[1:21:30] Sunday we're talking about
[1:21:32] Israel how they went through a tough
[1:21:35] time how they suffered how you know they
[1:21:38] had been taken away as
[1:21:41] captives from from you know to Babylon
[1:21:43] from
[1:21:44] Israel because of their sin. But then we
[1:21:48] see here in
[1:21:49] lamentation prophet Jeremiah
[1:21:52] crying and then we talked about God
[1:21:55] actually crying in Jeremiah.
[1:21:59] And then he begins to speak these
[1:22:01] words. And then he begins to say the
[1:22:03] Lord is
[1:22:05] mercies because of these mercies we are
[1:22:08] not consumed because his compassions
[1:22:10] fail
[1:22:12] not. So in other words, he knew because
[1:22:15] of the compassions of the
[1:22:17] Lord, Israel will not be utterly
[1:22:21] destroyed throughout their suffering.
[1:22:24] God will carry them and bring them back
[1:22:26] in their
[1:22:27] homeland. And in the same way, even as
[1:22:30] today in the New Testament church, the
[1:22:33] compassions of the Lord fail
[1:22:36] not. Now, to us as a church, but to you
[1:22:40] as an
[1:22:42] individual, what we are talking about
[1:22:44] today, it will help you in your
[1:22:47] Christian journey.
[1:22:50] I stopped years ago to preach sermons
[1:22:53] which will make you
[1:22:56] happy. I always wait upon
[1:22:59] God for something that will build your
[1:23:02] Christian
[1:23:05] life. So we just listen carefully. These
[1:23:08] these things are
[1:23:10] meant to build your your spiritual
[1:23:13] life for you to
[1:23:15] understand your personal by the
[1:23:17] Christianity.
[1:23:19] is
[1:23:20] not a collective kind of worship.
[1:23:28] Listen, it is a personal
[1:23:33] walk. If you in your personal walk with
[1:23:36] the
[1:23:38] Lord, you are not able to be a
[1:23:41] Christian, you will never be a
[1:23:44] Christian in your personal walk.
[1:23:49] the things you're suffering as an
[1:23:51] individual. Forget about jumping,
[1:23:53] clapping, and shouting and everything.
[1:23:56] I'm talking about when the heat comes on
[1:24:02] you. You are there in the world. You are
[1:24:05] there at home or you are you are there
[1:24:07] in the real things in the real
[1:24:09] life from the in about a few minutes
[1:24:12] you're going to leave this
[1:24:14] place. You know that's when you the heat
[1:24:17] is going to come on and then you realize
[1:24:19] that this is now your real
[1:24:24] life. These things that we hear
[1:24:27] here things supposed to take us through
[1:24:29] that
[1:24:31] life. I want you to look at John chapter
[1:24:35] 5. After this, there was a feast of the
[1:24:37] Jews. And Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
[1:24:40] And now and there is um at Jerusalem by
[1:24:43] the sheep market a pool which is called
[1:24:46] in the Hebrew tongue batha having five
[1:24:49] porches. In in these lay a great
[1:24:51] multitude of important folk of blind,
[1:24:54] hold withered, waiting for the moving of
[1:24:57] the water. For an angel went down at a
[1:25:00] certain season into the pool and
[1:25:02] troubled the water. Whosoever then fast
[1:25:05] after the troubling of the water stepped
[1:25:08] in was made whole of whatsoever disease
[1:25:11] he had. And a certain man was there
[1:25:13] which had an infirmity 30 and 80 years.
[1:25:18] This is real life. I'm talking about
[1:25:19] something really that someone
[1:25:21] experienced.
[1:25:23] When Jesus saw him lie and knew that he
[1:25:26] had been now a long time in that case,
[1:25:29] he saith unto him, W thou be made
[1:25:32] whole, the impotent man answered him,
[1:25:35] Sir, I have no man when the water is
[1:25:38] troubled to put me in the into the pool,
[1:25:40] but while I am coming, another stepeth
[1:25:42] down before me. Jesus said unto him,
[1:25:44] Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. And
[1:25:48] immediately the man was made whole and
[1:25:50] took up his bed and walked and on the
[1:25:52] same day was the Sabbath. Now I I have
[1:25:55] many things to say on that but I'll just
[1:25:56] right away because of time read this
[1:25:58] quote for you in the message Jesus
[1:25:59] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:26:01] forever. He says, "Now into this pool
[1:26:04] where where you go to the pool and great
[1:26:06] multitudes of the impotent folk laid
[1:26:11] there of lame, hot, blind, withered,
[1:26:14] waiting for the moving of the
[1:26:16] water, waiting for an angel to come down
[1:26:18] in a certain
[1:26:20] season and trembled and troubled the
[1:26:23] water. Whoever stepping in first was
[1:26:26] made
[1:26:27] whole of whosoever disease he had."
[1:26:32] Look here. Come Jesus. Let's dramatize
[1:26:36] this just a
[1:26:37] moment. Here is a woman standing there
[1:26:40] with a little baby with a water
[1:26:44] head about like like that. Here is a
[1:26:47] poor old daddy with
[1:26:50] arthritis standing there an old blind
[1:26:53] mother screaming
[1:26:55] there. And anyone that's ever read the
[1:26:58] Bible
[1:26:59] history, the book of of the matters, the
[1:27:02] foxes books of
[1:27:04] matters, Joseph was writing that they
[1:27:07] even stabbed one another trying to get
[1:27:09] into that pool
[1:27:11] [Music]
[1:27:12] fast. When the angel came in the water,
[1:27:16] they would even stab one another, try
[1:27:18] and pull and be the first to get
[1:27:21] healed. Are you hearing me? So, so they
[1:27:25] would get healed of whatever disease he
[1:27:28] had. Some of them laughed at it. Said
[1:27:30] the wind just changed around the wall
[1:27:33] trouble the
[1:27:34] [Music]
[1:27:35] water. But they believed it was an
[1:27:39] angel. I believe it was an
[1:27:41] angel and they stepped into the pool.
[1:27:45] God has always had some resource of
[1:27:47] healing for the people.
[1:27:51] Amen. Since he fell from
[1:27:55] sin, oh, and and and sickness came into
[1:27:58] the
[1:27:59] world, God is had some
[1:28:02] way. God has always had some way of
[1:28:05] healing the
[1:28:06] people in every
[1:28:10] generation. You know, he put up a a
[1:28:12] brass
[1:28:13] serpent. He put up a
[1:28:16] pawn, a prophet, something somewhere and
[1:28:20] the people got
[1:28:21] healed. And this great troubling of the
[1:28:25] pool, the waters moving
[1:28:28] around being troubled. Then Jesus comes
[1:28:31] by this audience of
[1:28:35] people. Here he come now. The
[1:28:39] very was in Christ recognizing the world
[1:28:42] to himself.
[1:28:45] Here is God
[1:28:47] Jehovah dwelling in his
[1:28:50] son Christ Jesus moving by this pool of
[1:28:55] water. And now he asks a question. Do
[1:28:58] you believe he was full of
[1:29:01] love? Do you believe he had compassion
[1:29:03] on the
[1:29:06] people? Watch him
[1:29:08] pass that only crippled up further
[1:29:11] there.
[1:29:14] We
[1:29:16] screaming and begging for
[1:29:19] help. He
[1:29:20] passed and him passing through there and
[1:29:24] his garments full of
[1:29:27] virtue but passed right by him by just
[1:29:32] touching that
[1:29:34] man. That man would have been healed.
[1:29:36] That man would have been healed. That
[1:29:38] problem would have been solved. But he
[1:29:40] passed one by one.
[1:29:43] And this is a man full of
[1:29:46] compassion. And the Bible says his
[1:29:48] compassion fail
[1:29:50] not. But now here we
[1:29:53] see in the middle of all these
[1:29:56] people
[1:29:58] thousands suffering
[1:30:01] people. He never delivered any of
[1:30:05] them. This mother with a baby with a
[1:30:08] water head.
[1:30:11] passed by
[1:30:13] right. This poor old man standing
[1:30:15] there blind crying for mercy pass right
[1:30:19] there. He went on his
[1:30:22] way among that multitude of people until
[1:30:25] he come to a man laying on a
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:31] pallet and watch now you will get say
[1:30:35] Jesus knew that he would been a long
[1:30:37] time in this case.
[1:30:42] If he had
[1:30:44] compassion, why did he catch some of
[1:30:47] those poor lame hold blind without
[1:30:49] waiting for the troubling of the
[1:30:54] water? And he moving right around every
[1:30:58] one of them. moving right among like
[1:31:01] that full of love, full of compassion,
[1:31:05] passing every one of
[1:31:08] them. I I got the Messiah looking like
[1:31:11] pretty dark before you now, haven't
[1:31:16] I? And then he
[1:31:19] says, look like if he was full of love,
[1:31:21] he would have had mercy.
[1:31:27] He would have healed some of those
[1:31:29] people. And that's what the critics of
[1:31:31] divine healing fail to see
[1:31:35] today. Their eyes are blind to the
[1:31:39] truth. Let's have a real
[1:31:41] talk. Why didn't Jesus heal those
[1:31:45] people? Yet he was full of
[1:31:48] mercy. Yet he was full of
[1:31:50] compassion. But he just passed. He just
[1:31:53] went through them.
[1:31:55] Maybe the problem is our definition of
[1:32:00] compassion. Maybe our problem is uh the
[1:32:02] definition of
[1:32:06] mercy. I wanted to hear what the prophet
[1:32:09] says and defines it in the message that
[1:32:11] this day this scriptures
[1:32:15] fulfilled. He was a man of
[1:32:18] compassion. But yet we fail sometime to
[1:32:21] understand what compassion is.
[1:32:26] and then you know God doesn't take you
[1:32:28] out of your
[1:32:30] situation after
[1:32:32] crying after praying after fasting and
[1:32:36] then you say God take me out of it and
[1:32:39] he doesn't take you out and then you get
[1:32:41] angry with God you say now I'm not
[1:32:44] even because he's not full of
[1:32:47] compassion the problem is your
[1:32:49] definition of compassion
[1:32:55] He left the blind. He left the the lame.
[1:32:59] He loved the widow. He loved the crying
[1:33:02] mother. He passed all of
[1:33:05] them. Yet he was so full of
[1:33:08] compassion. And then he went and when he
[1:33:10] reached this man lying on a
[1:33:15] palace,
[1:33:17] immediately he began speaking to him.
[1:33:21] Now, not human
[1:33:26] sympathy. It isn't
[1:33:29] compassion, but compassion is doing the
[1:33:32] will of
[1:33:34] God. Compassion is doing the will of
[1:33:40] God. The will of
[1:33:44] God. God, take me out of this fight. And
[1:33:49] he doesn't. Does it mean he does he
[1:33:52] doesn't mean he's not
[1:33:53] compassionate? Oh, he's still a
[1:33:55] compassionate
[1:33:56] friend. Even when you are in the
[1:33:59] fire in the fire, worship
[1:34:03] him. Amen. Because he's a compassionate
[1:34:09] friend. But then he will walk right out
[1:34:11] and then take someone out of the
[1:34:14] fire. Why? Because it is the will of
[1:34:18] God.
[1:34:20] The compassion of God is doing the will
[1:34:23] of
[1:34:26] God. When when Jeremiah was
[1:34:29] praying and speaking and he said,
[1:34:31] "God, his mercies are
[1:34:34] endless." What he says is the compassion
[1:34:38] failed not. But yet the children of
[1:34:41] Israel at the same time of
[1:34:44] lamenting they were in in in in in
[1:34:47] Babylon
[1:34:50] suffering. And it was the will of
[1:34:52] God for them to be there because they
[1:34:55] had disobeyed God. But it was not going
[1:34:58] to be
[1:34:59] forever. It was going to be for a
[1:35:02] season. The Bible says your
[1:35:05] suffering. which is for a season after
[1:35:08] it has finished.
[1:35:10] Then he will do what? He will establish
[1:35:13] you. He will settle you. He will grant
[1:35:16] you. You see, but there is a
[1:35:19] season. Why? Because he's molding
[1:35:22] something within
[1:35:23] you. And to them it was a season of 70
[1:35:27] years. And a man of God jumped up and
[1:35:30] down and began talking about the mercies
[1:35:32] of God, began talking about the
[1:35:35] compassions of God. But yet God did not
[1:35:38] take them
[1:35:39] out because the season was not
[1:35:44] complete. The season had to be
[1:35:47] complete for God to now manifest that
[1:35:50] same
[1:35:53] compassion. But now before that
[1:35:57] compassion is
[1:35:59] manifested, there is something that he
[1:36:01] has promised. He said you will not be
[1:36:05] consumed. He says because of his
[1:36:08] mercies, we are not
[1:36:10] consumed. Yes, he knows what we are
[1:36:12] going through. But before he takes us
[1:36:15] out and he shows us his
[1:36:18] compassion, he gives us the
[1:36:21] mercies to
[1:36:23] stand and go through it. He says, "Don't
[1:36:26] you worry, my son. Don't you worry, my
[1:36:28] daughter. I know you can make it. I know
[1:36:32] you can go through this. I did and you
[1:36:35] can because I did, you can
[1:36:38] too. I am in you. You can make it. You
[1:36:42] can make it. Day by day we are fighting
[1:36:46] the good fight of
[1:36:47] faith. And because of the mercies of
[1:36:50] God, we are not
[1:36:54] consumed. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And we
[1:36:58] see
[1:36:59] here. This man was lying on a
[1:37:02] pallet. He passed through the pool of
[1:37:04] based at the
[1:37:05] gate. There are laid people. Multitudes
[1:37:07] of them.
[1:37:09] Multitude is not just is not is not
[1:37:13] certain
[1:37:20] number. But there
[1:37:27] multit. And he had come, he had
[1:37:29] compassion on the people
[1:37:33] always. And he went to one
[1:37:35] person that was not lame.
[1:37:39] that was not blind, that was not whole,
[1:37:42] that was not
[1:37:44] withered. Maybe he had a prostate
[1:37:48] trouble. Maybe he had some little
[1:37:51] infirmity that was
[1:37:54] He had it for 38
[1:37:57] years. It wasn't going to bother him. It
[1:38:01] wasn't going to kill him anymore. He was
[1:38:03] laying on a pallet. And he said, "Will
[1:38:06] thou be made whole?
[1:38:09] And a man said, "I have nobody to put me
[1:38:11] in the
[1:38:13] water, but while I'm coming, someone
[1:38:16] steps down ahead of me." So he could
[1:38:18] walk. So he could
[1:38:20] walk. He could see, he could get
[1:38:24] around, but he was just feeble. And
[1:38:27] Jesus said unto him, "Rise up, take up
[1:38:30] your bed, and go to your house." And
[1:38:33] Jesus was questioned on that.
[1:38:36] For you remember the scripture said
[1:38:38] this. No wonder if he would come to
[1:38:40] Jeffersonville tonight and make an act
[1:38:42] like that, they would still talk about
[1:38:48] him. If Jesus would come to here and do
[1:38:51] the same
[1:38:52] thing, you would say if he has healed
[1:38:54] that one, why didn't he heal the other
[1:38:57] one? They will never
[1:38:59] understand. But remember he came to do
[1:39:02] one
[1:39:03] thing which that was the will of
[1:39:07] God. Now that's found in St. John
[1:39:12] 5:19 you will get the answer. He said
[1:39:14] very verily I say unto
[1:39:16] you. The son can do nothing in
[1:39:20] himself but what he sees the father
[1:39:24] doing that do with the
[1:39:27] son. The preacher cannot do anything for
[1:39:31] you except what God has shown
[1:39:35] him. Jesus could not do anything for
[1:39:38] you. Except what the father showed
[1:39:41] him. It's not because of the
[1:39:45] prayers. As much as we must
[1:39:47] pray, it is because of his
[1:39:50] will. Even when you pray something that
[1:39:52] is not in his
[1:39:55] will, it will not always be answered.
[1:39:59] We have to understand
[1:40:00] friends not all prayers are
[1:40:04] answered. I know one time I say that
[1:40:06] every prayer is
[1:40:08] answered and I'm not contradicting
[1:40:11] myself. Every prayer is answered but not
[1:40:15] all prayers are
[1:40:17] answered. Let me explain.
[1:40:20] Every prayer is
[1:40:21] answered because he can say
[1:40:25] no and he can say yes. But even when he
[1:40:28] says no to us it is not
[1:40:31] answered. To him it is
[1:40:34] answered. Not every answer will be a
[1:40:37] yes. Let us learn to believe in the will
[1:40:40] of
[1:40:42] God. Jesus himself had
[1:40:45] prayers which were never answered.
[1:40:49] The time he came and prayed, he said,
[1:40:52] "Father, if it is
[1:40:54] possible, take this cup away from
[1:40:57] me." But God simply looked at
[1:40:59] him and he
[1:41:02] said,"And then Jesus heard what God
[1:41:04] said." He said, "Okay, Father, not
[1:41:08] according to my will. According to your
[1:41:11] will, a believer
[1:41:13] understands. Not all prayers are
[1:41:16] answered the way we want." Hallelujah.
[1:41:21] Not every prayer is answered in our
[1:41:24] favor. Surely God answers all
[1:41:28] prayers. A believer must stay in a
[1:41:32] place of of being
[1:41:35] solid in Christ. Stand in Christ in
[1:41:39] Christ.
[1:41:41] Unmovable.
[1:41:43] Unmovable. where people will question
[1:41:46] the very thing you claim to
[1:41:48] believe and they will see your farm. If
[1:41:53] he kills me, he kills
[1:41:54] me. If I die, I die. But here I
[1:41:59] stand. Are you sure you want to go
[1:42:00] through the fire? I will go through the
[1:42:03] fire because that's the only
[1:42:05] way. If I die, I die. But I know he can
[1:42:08] save me. But if I die, I die.
[1:42:13] There are many men in the in the years
[1:42:16] past that prayed for many people and
[1:42:20] those people died and they kept on
[1:42:22] praying praying and praying. He never
[1:42:26] said that we should do it. He said he
[1:42:29] will do it. He said we should pray and
[1:42:32] believe.
[1:42:36] has come to a point whereby we don't
[1:42:39] even believe in exercising
[1:42:41] God. We no longer believe in divine
[1:42:45] healing. The the very first sign of
[1:42:48] sickness, we run to hospital. Why does
[1:42:52] the Bible say call for the
[1:42:55] elders, let them anoint you with oil and
[1:42:57] pray for you?
[1:42:59] Actually, I think was it on Sunday? My
[1:43:02] wife was just so
[1:43:04] badly after the service and and I was
[1:43:08] what what am I going to do? I had to go
[1:43:10] to the other brothers and so what what I
[1:43:14] did I I just knew cuz you know maybe I
[1:43:17] would have taken at
[1:43:18] hospital but I didn't have time. So I
[1:43:21] quickly picked up the anointing oil
[1:43:23] anointed hand prayed for her. She's 100%
[1:43:27] well
[1:43:29] now. The little boy was sick.
[1:43:32] I didn't have money and no money
[1:43:34] taking. So I said, "Dear, what you going
[1:43:37] to do? Don't allow the enemy to make you
[1:43:41] fast. Bring the baby here. I pray for
[1:43:44] the baby." So we prayed for the baby and
[1:43:46] him with oil and God healed him almost
[1:43:50] instantly. Now let me tell you friends,
[1:43:52] God is still
[1:43:54] faithful to keep his word. But it is us
[1:43:58] who lack faith in his
[1:44:00] word. But you see it has to be his
[1:44:05] will. His
[1:44:08] will shows his
[1:44:12] compassion. And here this man shouted,
[1:44:16] "Sir, I have no man." When the water is
[1:44:20] troubled, he put me into the pool.
[1:44:24] I am coming and I must die. He cried and
[1:44:27] shall I have no man.
[1:44:30] It was the will of God for him to be
[1:44:32] here for 38
[1:44:36] years so that God can show through him
[1:44:39] his
[1:44:41] glory. Sometime God allows your
[1:44:44] situation to
[1:44:47] persist. Even after going for
[1:44:50] prayer, even after praying yourself, the
[1:44:53] situation does not go. It is all right.
[1:44:57] God is
[1:44:58] preparing to show forth his
[1:45:01] glory. When God came down, he was that
[1:45:05] man.
[1:45:07] Amen. That he had waited for all
[1:45:10] this. At one point he said, "I have no
[1:45:14] man to take
[1:45:15] me." For the first year, I have no man.
[1:45:18] For the second year, 10 years, I have no
[1:45:21] man. 20 years, I have no man. 30 years,
[1:45:25] 38 years, I have no man. But now, I want
[1:45:30] you to see this image I'm trying to
[1:45:32] paint.
[1:45:35] Now when the man
[1:45:38] arrived, he did not arrive for
[1:45:41] everybody. He arrived for this man who
[1:45:45] cried out for 38 years. I have no man.
[1:45:51] How God had come to show that his
[1:45:55] compassion failed
[1:45:58] off that after 38
[1:46:01] years he can prove he's a compassionate
[1:46:06] friend. After 38 years he can prove he
[1:46:11] is still a
[1:46:13] healer. After 38 years he can prove he
[1:46:18] his mercies endureth forever.
[1:46:22] Maybe you are here also shouting within
[1:46:25] your heart and grumbling and mumbling. I
[1:46:29] have no man to take me out of my
[1:46:31] situation. I have no man to help me in
[1:46:34] my problem. I have no man. But I want to
[1:46:37] encourage you tonight. He is on his way.
[1:46:41] He is on his way because his compassion
[1:46:44] fell
[1:46:46] off. Hallelujah. Amen. The man is on his
[1:46:49] way.
[1:46:50] The man is on his way and when is his
[1:46:53] time to come, he will not allow anyone
[1:46:56] to delay
[1:46:57] him. That's why he says, "I come
[1:47:00] quickly." And even he says, "I come
[1:47:02] quickly." When he comes to take us in
[1:47:04] the rapture, no one will delay him. No
[1:47:08] delay. His eye is on the
[1:47:11] bride. His eye is on you. No one will
[1:47:15] delay him. That's why he will not touch
[1:47:17] this one.
[1:47:19] He will come straight to
[1:47:21] you, straight to your address, straight
[1:47:24] to your condition.
[1:47:26] Amen. He is a kind and compassionate
[1:47:32] friend. Hallelujah. Hebrews
[1:47:36] 4:14. Seeing that we have a high a great
[1:47:39] high
[1:47:40] priest that is passed into the heavens,
[1:47:43] Jesus the son of God.
[1:47:46] Let us hold fast our
[1:47:49] profession. For we have not an high
[1:47:51] priest which cannot be touched by the
[1:47:52] feeling of our
[1:47:55] infirmities. It was in all points
[1:47:57] tempted like as we
[1:47:59] are yet without sin. Let us that come
[1:48:02] boldly into the throne of
[1:48:05] grace that we may obtain
[1:48:09] mercy. Let us come
[1:48:11] boldly. Never fail to
[1:48:13] come. Let us find grace to help in time
[1:48:16] of need.
[1:48:19] In the amplified version, it says, "In
[1:48:22] as much as we believers have a great
[1:48:24] high priest,
[1:48:28] who has already ascended and passed
[1:48:30] through the heavens,
[1:48:33] Jesus, the son of
[1:48:35] God, let us hold fast our
[1:48:38] confession of faith, and cling
[1:48:41] tenaciously to our absolute trust in him
[1:48:44] as a savior.
[1:48:50] For we do not have a high priest who is
[1:48:52] unable to sympathize and understand our
[1:48:55] weaknesses and
[1:48:58] temptations. But one who has been
[1:49:06] tempted who has been temped knowing
[1:49:08] exactly how it feels to be
[1:49:14] human. Are you hearing
[1:49:17] Are you hearing me? He knows how it
[1:49:19] feels to be
[1:49:23] human in every respect as we
[1:49:27] are yet without committing any
[1:49:32] sin. Therefore, let us with
[1:49:37] privilege approach the throne of
[1:49:40] grace. That is the throne of God's
[1:49:43] gracious favor.
[1:49:49] Let us approach it with
[1:49:51] confidence, with confidence and without
[1:49:56] fear. So that we may receive
[1:50:00] mercy for our
[1:50:03] failures and find his amazing
[1:50:08] grace to help in the time of
[1:50:12] need. an appropriate
[1:50:17] blessing coming just at the right
[1:50:23] time. That's that's the compassion of
[1:50:28] God. Amen. Jesus said unto him, "Rise,
[1:50:33] take up thy bed, and walk." And
[1:50:36] immediately the man was made
[1:50:38] whole and took up his bed and walked.
[1:50:42] And on the same day was the Sabbath.
[1:50:47] Rise, take up thy bed, and
[1:50:53] walk. You see, friends, I want to show
[1:50:56] you something here. As I approach to
[1:50:58] finish in Acts
[1:51:01] 3:6, the Bible says, Peter said to the
[1:51:03] man, "Silver and gold have I none.
[1:51:08] But such as I have, I give unto
[1:51:10] thee, in the name of Jesus Christ of
[1:51:14] Nazareth, rise up and walk. And he took
[1:51:17] him by the right hand and lifted him up.
[1:51:21] And immediately his feet and ankle bones
[1:51:23] received
[1:51:26] strength. And he leaping up
[1:51:30] stood and walked and entered with them
[1:51:33] into the temple.
[1:51:36] walking and leaping and praising
[1:51:40] God. And all the people saw him
[1:51:43] walking and praising God, I'm showing
[1:51:47] you is the same yesterday and
[1:51:50] forever. But there's something that I
[1:51:52] want you to
[1:51:53] see. When Jesus told that
[1:51:56] man, rise up, take up your bed and walk.
[1:52:01] That was not an easy
[1:52:03] saying. But a man had to have faith for
[1:52:09] it. The time he had
[1:52:12] spent had built enough faith in
[1:52:15] him. You know what manner of man
[1:52:19] speaketh is more than the man I've been
[1:52:21] waiting
[1:52:23] for. This one has
[1:52:25] authority. He he stood up immediately
[1:52:28] and he was made whole. He took up his
[1:52:31] bed and he
[1:52:33] walked. And now the disciples are
[1:52:36] walking on the
[1:52:37] street and as they are going by the gate
[1:52:40] called
[1:52:42] beautiful. They find this beggar and
[1:52:46] this beggar was lame. But you see Peter
[1:52:49] said silver and gold we have
[1:52:52] none. But what we have we give unto you.
[1:52:55] In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
[1:52:59] rise up and walk. Now that is the
[1:53:04] word. That is the word. How many just
[1:53:08] believe the
[1:53:10] word? Many times is a
[1:53:13] few. But when you hear the word, it is
[1:53:16] creating something in
[1:53:19] you. And then see this
[1:53:22] man. It was no longer Peter.
[1:53:25] Now, it was no longer John. Now, he went
[1:53:29] to that man. You know, when he spoke the
[1:53:31] word, he had the word, but nothing
[1:53:34] happened. He was still lame. So, he went
[1:53:37] to him and gave up his
[1:53:41] hand, pulled him up. The moment he did
[1:53:44] that, the Bible says the man got
[1:53:47] strength in his legs. He got strength in
[1:53:50] his legs and he began walking, leaping
[1:53:55] and
[1:53:56] walking. Is it the same yesterday than
[1:53:58] forever?
[1:54:00] Hallelujah. That's why we preach the
[1:54:03] gospel because the gospel is trying to
[1:54:06] take you to your from your
[1:54:10] place. Amen. Telling you, you can
[1:54:14] walk. You can walk. You see that little
[1:54:17] push I gave you?
[1:54:20] is the word. What the word does, it's
[1:54:23] what the preachers
[1:54:24] do. It brings faith to
[1:54:27] you. You see, let me tell you, it brings
[1:54:31] faith into your
[1:54:33] heart. Many times we hear the
[1:54:36] word, we can read the word by
[1:54:39] ourself. But when a preacher preaches
[1:54:41] it, that's why brother Bam called it a
[1:54:47] spanking. It is meant
[1:54:49] to energize
[1:54:51] you. That's the word and then it pushes
[1:54:55] you into your
[1:54:58] promise. Amen. So whenever you are
[1:55:01] hearing the
[1:55:02] word this is
[1:55:06] happening and then let me read this
[1:55:09] quote as I finish from the wonders his
[1:55:11] wonders to
[1:55:13] perform. And then there was another
[1:55:16] danger. This little company, just a
[1:55:18] young man and his little newly married
[1:55:22] wife going along the road. Many robbers
[1:55:26] was in the land in those
[1:55:28] days like Barabas and so
[1:55:31] forth. He's talking about Mary and
[1:55:33] Joseph. And what a parade that would
[1:55:36] have been to them to see just a little
[1:55:38] man walking along with a little woman to
[1:55:39] be mother sitting on a little donkey.
[1:55:47] and with a little stick in his hand and
[1:55:48] for a group of
[1:55:51] wild mean men to write down and throw
[1:55:55] her off of there and do evil. But you
[1:55:57] know, if God is leading the way, what
[1:56:00] difference does it make?
[1:56:08] God will protect
[1:56:10] you to your
[1:56:14] destination. Amen. I say amen
[1:56:17] Lord. There is no dangers when you are
[1:56:19] walking with the
[1:56:22] Lord. Can you say amen to that?
[1:56:26] I would believe easily
[1:56:29] that there was a host of 10,000 angels
[1:56:31] walking along there with that man and
[1:56:33] that little
[1:56:37] donkey. She was just as safe as she
[1:56:40] could
[1:56:42] be. But perhaps little did she know
[1:56:45] these
[1:56:46] things and little did maybe Joseph know
[1:56:50] that all this was just about to
[1:56:52] happen. But we don't know. We don't have
[1:56:54] to know
[1:56:56] everything. We just believe by faith and
[1:56:59] walk
[1:57:01] on. God doesn't have to tell us all his
[1:57:07] plans. Just how he's going to make the
[1:57:09] morning stars shine in the
[1:57:12] morning. God will not tell you
[1:57:15] everything. Just move on.
[1:57:17] Anyhow, God takes care of his own.
[1:57:22] But I know his compassions fail
[1:57:26] not. And when you are prayed for being
[1:57:30] sick, you don't have to worry just how
[1:57:32] God is going to move that
[1:57:35] cancer. How God is going to make that
[1:57:37] crippled limb to come
[1:57:40] straight. Just go forward in
[1:57:43] faith. That's up to God to take care of
[1:57:45] that.
[1:57:47] You don't have to worry whether you will
[1:57:49] you will keep your job or if you will
[1:57:50] accept Christ as your
[1:57:56] savior. You don't have to worry whether
[1:57:58] the boss will be
[1:58:01] angry or your neighbor will turn you
[1:58:04] down or your mother will say that you've
[1:58:06] lost your
[1:58:08] mind or your dad turn you away from
[1:58:12] home. Just go forward.
[1:58:16] God will take care of the rest of
[1:58:20] it. There are many things we have no
[1:58:23] explanations
[1:58:25] for. Don't worry about it. His
[1:58:28] compassions fail
[1:58:30] now. Just keep
[1:58:33] moving. Just keep moving
[1:58:35] forward. God bless your
[1:58:38] heart. You may stand on your feet as we
[1:58:43] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:58:49] Great is thy
[1:58:54] faithfulness. Great is thy
[1:58:59] faithfulness. Morning by
[1:59:03] morning, new
[1:59:06] mercies I see.
[1:59:11] All I have
[1:59:14] needed, thy hand has
[1:59:20] proided. Great is thy
[1:59:26] faithfulness, Lord, unto
[1:59:30] me. One more time before we pray.
[1:59:33] Great is thy faithfulness.

[2:00:18] [Music]
[2:00:21] receive. Let us pray.
[2:00:25] Lord, great is your faithfulness.
[2:00:30] Many times we do not understand
[2:00:34] how you will take us to the promised
[2:00:35] land.
[2:00:37] But we say great is your faithfulness.
[2:00:40] Morning by morning, your mercies are
[2:00:42] new. And Lord, your compassion is fail,
[2:00:45] Lord. You have us in in your mind and
[2:00:48] you have our lives in your control.
[2:00:51] Continue leading us, Lord. We don't know
[2:00:54] everything. We don't know how to explain
[2:00:56] everything, Lord. But we believe in you,
[2:00:58] Lord. Knowing how you will take us
[2:01:00] through. Knowing how you'll give us
[2:01:02] grace to overcome. Father, give each of
[2:01:04] us, Lord, patience. Give each of us
[2:01:07] grace to
[2:01:08] understand that you are faithful, Lord.
[2:01:11] And your mercies are new every
[2:01:14] morning. Bless each one of us,
[2:01:16] Father. Bind us together with the cords
[2:01:19] of love that can never be broken.
[2:01:21] Bless those who have been streaming
[2:01:23] also. Give the grand desires of their
[2:01:25] heart. Lord, Father Lord, we remember
[2:01:28] also to pray for the offerings and the
[2:01:30] tithes that are going to be given now.
[2:01:33] Bless every gift. I
[2:01:34] pray as we we do this as a part of our
[2:01:37] worship Lord in Jesus
[2:01:40] name. Amen. Brother Shalom, God bless
[2:01:43] you. God bless you. See you Friday night
[2:01:45] 10
[2:01:48] p.m. Amen.
