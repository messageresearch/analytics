[7:00] us with someone who has sacrificed so

[7:05] [Music]
[7:07] here um I've known I've known Brother
[7:11] tazwell since uh
[7:15] Co and uh I
[7:19] think I'm trying to remember now uh I
[7:22] think we used to have some
[7:25] meetings they used to some of you might
[7:27] have seen that they used to
[7:30] organize International youth meetings
[7:34] [Music]
[7:37] during how many countries we
[7:38] participating in
[7:42] that he doesn't even have a number all
[7:45] over the
[7:46] world uh he will tell us I think it were
[7:49] called
[7:50] RFB something like that youth meting uh
[7:54] anybody here who participated on that
[7:57] online yeah I see a hand
[8:00] there well I see Uganda most of Uganda
[8:03] was left
[8:05] out but me and my family
[8:08] participated
[8:10] and and they really encouraged the young
[8:13] people during
[8:16] lockdown you remember how lock lockdown
[8:19] was difficult for all of
[8:21] us and now we are Beyond
[8:24] lockdown and these are one of the people
[8:27] that God used during that time to
[8:32] an IM for the young
[8:36] people and like I told you he streamed
[8:38] our services last
[8:43] year and this year he told me I'm not

[9:13] miles just to come and speak to you for
[9:15] one
[9:17] hour that means there is someone
[9:20] here that God has to speak
[9:25] to you remember when Jesus the Bible

[9:33] someone's way this

[23:08] best that we can give
[23:11] him hallelujah amen so like brother B
[23:16] said I have a genuine
[23:20] burden for young
[23:22] people I have young people in my
[23:26] home I've got a 23y old
[23:30] daughter an 18y old
[23:33] son a 15y old
[23:37] daughter and a 13y old
[23:40] son so I know what young people are
[23:45] experiencing and I want to I want to
[23:48] just express to you before we go into
[23:51] the
[23:53] word the burden that I
[23:55] have for you
[23:58] over this
[24:00] weekend so I wrote it down
[24:03] here to
[24:05] anybody that has not experienced the
[24:08] realities of
[24:12] God my prayer for
[24:15] you is that you will
[24:18] have a
[24:21] glorious Born Again experience this
[24:26] weekend
[24:32] there would be such a power in that
[24:38] experience that when you leave
[24:43] here the devil will
[24:46] know that you have been with
[24:51] Jesus your friends will
[24:55] know that you have been with Jesus
[24:59] J and you will
[25:02] know that you have been with
[25:08] Jesus now I say that this
[25:12] morning because many many years
[25:16] ago I was a young
[25:19] man that came into a meeting like
[25:25] this I was a young man
[25:29] I grew up in the
[25:32] message I knew the quotes of brother
[25:38] Brandon I could
[25:41] quote and I could win you with
[25:46] quotes that was what I
[25:49] knew but I did not
[25:52] know the god of William
[25:56] Bram
[25:59] all I knew was the dead
[26:03] letter but no
[26:07] experience until the 25th of
[26:11] December
[26:14] 1995 I walked into a meeting like
[26:19] this I thought I was kind of
[26:24] cool I had my hair slick back
[26:31] and I
[26:32] knew in that
[26:34] meeting the P will
[26:36] come he'll read a
[26:39] scripture he'll read some quotes of
[26:41] brother
[26:43] Brandon tell some good
[26:46] stories and the meeting would
[26:48] end a normal message
[26:52] meeting but what I did not
[26:55] know was that day
[26:58] was my day of the calendar of
[27:05] God that
[27:07] day 24th of
[27:11] December
[27:15] 1995 God swept into the
[27:20] meeting he came to my
[27:23] seat transformed my life
[27:30] then this
[27:33] Bible was no more dead
[27:36] letter but it was
[27:40] life and it is stole life
[27:43] [Music]
[27:49] today brother BOS
[27:52] said that there's someone here
[27:56] today that there's an
[27:59] appointment with the supernatural
[28:03] God as the word Goes
[28:06] Forth as the word is
[28:09] preached you sit in your
[28:12] seat and you say Lord I need
[28:15] it father I want
[28:18] you to
[28:20] transform my
[28:26] life and my
[28:29] God is a big
[28:33] God there is
[28:36] nothing that he cannot
[28:42] do
[28:44] so I don't
[28:47] care in what
[28:51] state you
[28:54] think you might be in this morning
[28:59] my God can take
[29:03] you from
[29:06] there and he can lift you up and he can
[29:09] put you
[29:11] there and then he can take you from
[29:13] there and he can take you up and he put
[29:17] you
[29:18] there but you and me we've got to cry
[29:25] out so let's cry out
[29:28] for more of
[29:34] Jesus you see brother brandham
[29:37] says as we receive the
[29:42] word we become the
[29:48] word that is what this
[29:52] message is
[29:55] producing in this generation
[30:02] let me read your
[30:04] quote God's provided a way of
[30:08] healing brother brandham
[30:10] says now you can preach the word you can
[30:14] preach the
[30:15] word you can explain the
[30:18] word but you have to receive the
[30:24] word if there's anything and everything
[30:27] that you
[30:29] forget after this
[30:32] meeting don't
[30:34] forget
[30:36] I must receive the
[30:39] word brother bam says that's what set
[30:42] the
[30:44] fire when you receive
[30:50] it he says you receive the
[30:54] revelation of this word
[30:58] and I'm
[30:59] grateful for this
[31:02] message which has opened this
[31:05] Bible to me
[31:09] personally brother Bram
[31:12] says as you receive the
[31:15] word something
[31:19] Supernatural
[31:21] happens you see you and
[31:24] I we are a supernatural
[31:29] we believe in a supernatural
[31:33] God so he says
[31:35] this he says as you receive the
[31:38] word something slips out of the Unseen
[31:46] World he says it comes rolling
[31:50] down through a mystical Channel
[31:55] somewhere into your
[31:58] soul and maybe you might not
[32:02] understand maybe you might not see what
[32:04] the Bible
[32:06] says but as you receive the
[32:10] word my God he comes your
[32:15] way and he opens you
[32:18] understanding he gives you
[32:21] Revelation but the says then you
[32:25] say now I see it
[32:31] and do you
[32:33] know the
[32:35] power of receiving the
[32:39] word it's not just something that
[32:41] happens on the
[32:44] inside brother Brandon
[32:47] says you see it on the
[32:50] outside I'll read you the
[32:52] quote he says as you receive the word
[32:57] and as God comes your
[33:00] way he says your
[33:03] eyes brighten
[33:08] up he says your
[33:10] LPS that was
[33:13] said that was
[33:16] said starts turning into a
[33:21] smile he says every muscle in your body
[33:29] [Music]
[33:31] rejoices that's the
[33:33] power of the
[33:36] word but you and me we need to receive
[33:41] the
[33:42] word so as the
[33:45] preachers are going to
[33:49] come behind the sacred desk behind this
[33:54] desk and as they going to preach
[33:59] the
[34:00] word my
[34:02] encouragement my encouragement to
[34:06] you receive
[34:10] it receive because when you receive the
[34:14] word you come to
[34:18] realize that we are a
[34:21] generation they cannot
[34:25] lose Satan lost the
[34:29] battle Satan lost the
[34:33] battle Satan lost the
[34:36] battle he didn't let the devil
[34:41] win so you a
[34:44] generation that cannot
[34:50] lose in the message Angel of the
[34:55] Covenant brother brandham
[34:58] says the
[35:00] Christian has doesn't have any worry in
[35:02] the

[36:28] you are an
[36:37] overcomer do you know
[36:39] what the fact the

[37:34] any
[37:36] lie that the devil tells
[37:40] you because whenever he opens his

[37:51] you that you a
[37:55] sinner the devil will tell

[39:10] future it's
[39:20] now young
[39:23] people appreciate what you have
[39:29] appreciate the
[39:31] word brother Brandon

[39:36] God will defeat
[39:39] Satan

[43:40] seated now brother brandham
[43:42] comes in the
[43:44] message the
[43:47] contest and he tells us a
[43:53] contest it's a strength sorry it's a
[43:57] test of
[43:59] strength a test of
[44:02] strength and he who
[44:05] say in those
[44:07] days the
[44:09] Indians would make a
[44:12] fire and a few of them would stand that
[44:17] side a few of them would stand the
[44:20] side and they'll have a rope in
[44:24] between and then the group the side the
[44:29] group the
[44:30] side and there's a group that
[44:33] side and they'll hold the
[44:35] rope and they'll
[44:38] pull and the objective
[44:42] is to get that
[44:45] group into the
[44:49] fire my brother BR
[44:51] says the greatest
[44:54] contest
[44:56] that there
[44:58] is is between the
[45:01] church that's
[45:03] you and
[45:07] Satan you know that
[45:10] right you experience
[45:14] it every
[45:18] day the devil is
[45:21] pulling and God is
[45:24] pulling
[45:26] the god in
[45:31] you so brother brandham
[45:33] says the great strength of Satan the
[45:37] great strength of
[45:40] Satan
[45:42] Satan is
[45:44] powerful but my God he's more
[45:50] powerful don't forget
[45:54] that my brother br says the great the
[45:57] great strength of
[46:00] Satan he says and we want to
[46:04] speak of the great
[46:07] strength of
[46:09] God in his
[46:13] church God in
[46:16] you God in
[46:19] Me and brother B would
[46:21] say this
[46:23] contest started in heaven
[46:27] we know the Bible
[46:30] right Satan was kicked
[46:32] out and since
[46:35] then he's used all his
[46:39] strength and his
[46:42] strategy to try to
[46:46] pull God's
[46:49] people into the
[46:52] fire but remember this remember
[46:57] this Satan lost the
[47:02] battle my
[47:04] God Jesus let the devil
[47:13] win he goes on in the
[47:17] contest and we
[47:19] know who has the most
[47:24] power
[47:27] do you
[47:28] know Satan is
[47:31] here my God is
[47:33] here you tell
[47:35] me who has got the most
[47:42] power my
[47:45] God he's got the most
[47:48] power so when the Devil
[47:51] comes and tries to mess you
[47:54] up
[47:56] because that's what he wants to
[48:00] do you
[48:02] see I said
[48:04] earlier this
[48:06] Bible tells you who you
[48:12] are the
[48:14] devil
[48:16] Satan does not want you to
[48:20] know who you
[48:24] are because when you get to
[48:27] know who you
[48:31] are the devil will
[48:35] run and that's
[48:38] why the devil wants to keep you down
[48:43] here but this
[48:46] weekend can be your
[48:50] [Music]
[48:52] weekend let that be your confession
[48:57] say after
[48:59] me say
[49:00] this this
[49:02] weekend is my
[49:05] weekend first
[49:08] weekend is my
[49:16] weekend you
[49:18] see
[49:20] Christianity being a
[49:24] Christian
[49:26] is not just about
[49:29] being a good
[49:32] person it's not about just
[49:36] obeying all the
[49:40] rules do you
[49:43] know before
[49:46] God transformed my
[49:50] life I
[49:52] thought that this message
[49:56] is just a bunch of
[49:59] difficult
[50:04] rules and do you know how hard it was
[50:07] for
[50:10] me as a young
[50:12] person to try to
[50:16] obey all these
[50:20] rules but you
[50:22] know when God came my way
[50:26] and he transformed my
[50:29] life I
[50:32] realize it's not just about a bunch of
[50:37] rules but young
[50:39] people it is a
[50:41] life that is
[50:45] love and because you love
[50:50] Jesus you want to
[50:53] do what the word says
[50:56] I must
[50:59] do you see this
[51:02] message is about
[51:06] Christ being
[51:09] formed in his young
[51:14] people Colossians
[51:18] 1:27 says
[51:20] Christ in
[51:24] you
[51:27] I want to read you a
[51:30] quote this quote I I just love
[51:34] it because this
[51:36] quote speaks of
[51:39] me in the Statue of a perfect
[51:43] man brother Brandon
[51:46] says now many
[51:49] times we
[51:52] question what is this message
[51:56] all
[51:59] about who is Brother
[52:02] BR why did he
[52:05] come I just want to read you a
[52:09] quote and there's many quotes out
[52:12] there but this
[52:14] quote is personal to brother
[52:19] T brother T brother
[52:22] T God bless you he's doing a good job
[52:25] right you're doing a good job God bless
[52:28] you to follow my South African
[52:33] accent statue of a perfect
[52:36] man we are not building an
[52:43] organization brother brandham
[52:45] says I'm not here this
[52:49] morning to bold an
[52:53] organization Christ never sent me
[52:55] me to build
[52:59] organization Christ sent me to build
[53:05] individuals you and you and you to the
[53:12] statue of Jesus
[53:15] Christ that
[53:17] you might be a Power
[53:23] House a house
[53:26] holding so much
[53:28] power that's
[53:30] word is
[53:33] power and this
[53:35] word is being
[53:38] formed in
[53:44] you so this
[53:47] message is
[53:49] Bolding a
[53:53] powerful young people
[53:58] people don't
[54:01] think because I am
[54:04] young I cannot do
[54:08] much there is an
[54:11] authority there is a
[54:14] power that lays within
[54:17] you God wants
[54:20] you to
[54:23] recognize and that is
[54:27] why you and
[54:29] I must
[54:32] receive the
[54:38] word so
[54:41] Christianity or being in the
[54:45] message it's not just about being a good
[54:53] person but there is something
[54:58] powerful
[55:00] happening in each one of
[55:05] you now if you will allow me just for a
[55:08] few
[55:10] minutes I want to just go over some
[55:12] quotes of brother
[55:16] Bram and I I titled this
[55:21] section that there is a
[55:24] secret
[55:26] to
[55:27] living a Victorious
[55:33] Life you
[55:35] see you
[55:37] can
[55:40] Victorious it's laying inside of
[55:44] you you might not recognize
[55:48] it but God he sees
[55:52] it he sees that there's a power
[55:56] within his young
[55:59] people but maybe his young
[56:03] people is's not see
[56:06] it brother Bron if you will allow me
[56:10] gives us
[56:12] some
[56:15] instruction he
[56:18] says
[56:19] now he says I'm up against
[56:23] something
[56:25] he says I'm not much of a
[56:28] Preacher but if I could get people to
[56:35] see that they have to absolutely come
[56:40] clean with
[56:46] God then I
[56:49] believe I've Had The
[56:53] Authority by Jesus
[56:56] Christ to break the
[57:00] power of any
[57:03] demon that there
[57:06] is because brother you know brother
[57:09] brand who tell
[57:11] us when he was 12 years old when he was
[57:15] 12 years
[57:17] old there was an evil spirit hanging
[57:20] over
[57:23] him trying to tell
[57:26] him wait a
[57:28] bit don't give yourself over to
[57:32] God and I've come to
[57:36] realize that with many of our young
[57:41] people they want to break
[57:48] free but they are
[57:51] afraid to come clean
[57:58] they are
[58:00] afraid to
[58:04] repent now that word
[58:07] repent am I allowed to say that in a
[58:10] message
[58:13] church I believe
[58:16] yes because we make
[58:19] mistakes right brother is about flesh
[58:26] T makes
[58:29] mistakes and what the devil wants to
[58:33] do he sees you make the
[58:37] mistake and then he keeps you
[58:41] there he makes you feel so
[58:46] guilty he makes you feel so
[58:52] embarrassed I cannot confess
[58:57] that but you
[58:59] know that when you
[59:03] repent and if you make the wrong
[59:09] right my
[59:11] God can take you
[59:15] [Music]
[59:20] higher
[59:22] so the says here in believing
[59:27] God talks about the young
[59:29] man he asked the young
[59:32] man do you want to be
[59:37] saved the young man tells brother
[59:41] brandham I don't
[59:45] know brother bham
[59:47] says the
[59:49] devil is keeping that
[59:53] boy brother Brandon
[59:56] says that
[59:58] boy he wants to do
[1:00:02] right but there's a
[1:00:05] spirit a
[1:00:07] demon a power that's holding that boy
[1:00:12] down now if I am speaking to anybody
[1:00:15] this
[1:00:17] morning I want you to
[1:00:20] know that you can go free
[1:00:30] if you look around
[1:00:32] you just look at your brother and your
[1:00:36] sister you are not looking at a
[1:00:42] loser

[1:19:09] Saints while we are meditating about
[1:19:11] what we have heard this early
[1:19:17] morning I have no
[1:19:20] doubt that God has spoken to us
[1:19:25] not only to start the day off in
[1:19:33] power but is leading you onto a
[1:19:39] Direction I want you to take a moment
[1:19:43] friends to
[1:19:47] meditate about the words that have been
[1:19:49] spoken this early
[1:19:51] morning
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:19:56] do you believe that God has spoken to
[1:20:00] you and you take it
[1:20:05] personally this is a
[1:20:07] generation that cannot
[1:20:13] lose I am that
[1:20:16] generation that cannot
[1:20:20] lose
[1:20:21] now
[1:20:23] we in a
[1:20:25] Warfare God has come here today through
[1:20:28] the lips of our brother
[1:20:32] Taz and he told you I know you in a
[1:20:37] battle between right and
[1:20:41] wrong I know you have
[1:20:44] pressure from the
[1:20:47] world I know what you're going
[1:20:49] through I know it is difficult for you
[1:20:53] he also said Satan has
[1:20:56] power he admitted it he said
[1:20:59] it it's the power he gave him so he
[1:21:02] knows he has
[1:21:05] it but then again he said to
[1:21:08] you you the
[1:21:10] generation that cannot
[1:21:16] lose because he that is in
[1:21:20] US is greater than the one that is in
[1:21:23] the
[1:21:25] world so fear
[1:21:27] not the battle you are

[1:22:21] win but I'm saying we are going to win
[1:22:23] in this

[1:30:45] win and we cannot
[1:30:48] lose thank you brother for coming
[1:30:53] thank you for speaking to us you can see
[1:30:56] that the words he was speaking was a
[1:30:57] burden in his
[1:31:00] heart and also out of an
[1:31:04] experience and my prayer for everyone
[1:31:07] that is camping here this
[1:31:11] weekend some I know we have some new
[1:31:13] people who are not like who are new to
[1:31:16] the
[1:31:18] message and they don't know what and he
[1:31:21] mentioned they don't know what it's all
[1:31:24] about and some think it's just a set of
[1:31:27] quotes
[1:31:30] and and a set of regulations and
[1:31:34] rules but the message is much more than
[1:31:38] that the message is a
[1:31:40] life it is God living in
[1:31:43] you and uh this weekend my prayer also
[1:31:47] is that those who have not yet come to
[1:31:50] that level to understand the message
[1:31:51] that way
[1:31:55] they will be able to come to that
[1:31:57] place the devil should not keep you in
[1:32:00] fear and if there is something that is
[1:32:02] wrong in your
[1:32:05] life God had to send someone from New
[1:32:09] Zealand to come and tell
[1:32:12] you just make it right just
[1:32:16] repent and it will be behind
[1:32:19] you and if you're struggling
[1:32:22] you can begin a new
[1:32:25] life I believe there is going to be many
[1:32:27] that will come to their place of
[1:32:32] victory in these
[1:32:35] meetings praise the
[1:32:38] Lord once again I'd like to appreciate
