whether brother Isaac you're ready [Music] God bless you I am not singing I think I should brother but I'm giving a testimony uh I got some people were asking me uh they were like after weddings we usually see uh people coming and be like hey brother this and this thank you for what you did for us and even thanking God but uh they were like brother we didn't see you I be like when you're thanking God you don't have to be to be in front of the church and for the people I don't think they give to be [Music] thanked that I sent messages to everyone and those that I didn't send messages to I'm sure they know that I was grateful and my actually I'm requesting if she can come so um yes we didn't come here to thank the people I think because it was not God's appointed time that could have been our season but it was not good season yeah so uh brother Andrew yeah if you could also [Music] come because he was my best man I don't know I had plan to give the testimony today and I was not sure if he was going to be here just me a few days ago so I was happy so um we remember Andre came here and testified he was like uh so when he got married he got a good job so was like uh yes that's also a fact but at the end of it it's good also that you need more so um before I got married I was okay I was single and life was not bad and I think I was satisfied with what I had so uh the only person I used to discuss issues Financial issues both being a parent and also a p so uh when I got married I found when I spending I used to spend 10K per day it's more than double so I was not prepared for that so things got kind of hard I thought it would be atast double but then it got more than dou people can understand so I discussed the issue with bu and he was like I think what whatever you've been doing I think this time you need more income so of course we had put it into prayer so in that way um I remember after the wedding I shared with some brothers there was a lot of Revival in the church there was a lot of prophecies a lot of things which came on I remember you all remember that day when Pastor talked about uh you receive what and then specifically talked about cloes don't but just give me some time you are in the group Church the WhatsApp church group how many peoplei about like there are many you so that same week I got contacted by brother epim and he was like hey I think certain there are certain new new kind of traditional way that I would want to give you as a gift for your wedding for and your wife this is what has been going on isn't that Supernatural so um from there uh I was searching for a job for a good job already had some but then I needed but brein I'm not trying to to to exaggerate I was looking for a job and I get contacted by someone but this happened I was home with my wife I remember I was in the living room I received a message someone from Gana contacts me just from the blue I discuss with the wife she was like oh everything will be okay he text me LinkedIn he be like on LinkedIn so he's like hey we see you have this kind of of experience BL we have a ugan office are for someone to do this this in the and gas sector the oil and gas industry I would like to know if you have the oil and gas experience so that you take over the job so I'm like uh I told my wife I don't have the oil and gas it's worth giving so I talked to him that even he was like do you have time because it was around 1 he was like can we have a call at around at 500 p.m. yeah was like yeah my was like give it a try so I talked to him I peached my profile to him was like okay fine I'll get back then uh the following week I get contacted by the country manager here for an interview I went there the following week everything was perfect uh the following week progression there I get the offer and I got the [Music] contract so I won't start from Brother Andrew but uh there's brother Andrew there's brother [Music] Joel uh there's another sister Rec gave a testimony so and other things that are spiritual that are not about jobs are about spiritual life and everything I would really love to to say that God is really doing a great work and most as young people the only thing we have to do is to submit to God and that's the only thing like the Supernaturals just just happen so I got the contract I was given two weeks uh uh two weeks uh uh time to be to be home to and I'm and the salary I don't want to talk about yeah because it's enough for us it's what we are looking for so I thank everyone who has been

Lord we come to you as your servants to bless uh this couple as our brother uh Alan today has done an engagement with our sister under expectation that soon they will have their marriage consumated you've kept them before and as they continued serving now they're going to continue serving as they finally wait for that day when they will be United as husband and therefore ask you to keep them Lord the Ang of the Lord to be around the enemy is not Happ with this but Lord you will do it any Lord as the brother said he wants to build together with her so that they together can serve God lord it's just promises they have met to each other behind those promises hearts that are surrendered to you matters you keep them away from the evil eye away from the plan of the enemy from every force of evil and preserve them Lord for your name glory in the name of our Lord Jes amen amen so we declare brother Alan and from today officially engaged amen amen you not yet married you are just engaged so this is what we believe this is how we do it I did not know that brother Alan has all those words I know him as a silent brother but I think love is just very strong pulled all the words out of and so for us we don't believe in um you know meeting out there and um you know as husband and wife before marriage and some people always put deons on them but for me I don't do that because I believe that's the work of the Holy Spirit and these are Christians if some young people go and mess up they will be accountable for that before the day of judgment but we have taugh these young people we have t you as a church and I believe this is the right way to go amen uh mlin has uh you know I think we took her in in our home since she was I don't remember the age but probably seven or eight 10 around there and so we stayed with her uh we were uh newly married with my wife and then uh we shortly after that went to Ethiopia so then that's when she went back to her parents so when we returned then she came back so she's our daughter and her mother is here uh she's who sang you can you stand so they can see yes God bless you amen and the rest of some of the rest of the family and by the way this young man is also this is so and then we I know some of the family of baka are here can you also stand so can recogize [Music] I said Rand I'm saying Al brother Alan yes thank thank you so much thank you for coming those are your chairs keep them we have given them to you don't take them but use them wherever you come here yeah so we are we are so honored by your presence trust that the Lord will uh uh bless you today we now go into the word amen I I think it's I usually let this happen because it's a good example to other young people show them look this is the way you don't just go out there and don't go out you get you call a girl you break no we don't do that here and you sister if you also accept it and you know boys begin using you out there and I really send out a warning a boy that will ask that will ask uh to meet you privately and say let us go sleep together before you're married to them that one is a fox he will never marry you some of you are here and you already heartbroken he will never he's just lying to you is using you so don't accept my daughter here whenever she received boys sending her messages she's one of the group team leaders what your group yeah yeah so she always um talks with these brothers on those matters but when a brother changes his idea love issues she will put the protective measure and many times she will tell us now look at this and we will find out one day I called one of them I told her are you interested in Maring my daughter said no no I was just so why if you're not interested why are youing you are not serious you are coming around to joke with her parents be protective of your children you are their Angels they don't have other Angels some people would say that's being overprotected it is better you you do it because God has placed you there as their angel if they get up if they get messed up under your roof no one else is accountable that boy is not accountable as a parent you are accountable amen for you

in in Tigra the family of our brother so we send you our greetings from here to amen and may the Lord also minister to you this morning we are reading out of the book of Philippians chapter 2 and then also we read in the Book of James being in the form of God thought it not Roby to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross wherefor God also has highly exalted him and given him a name above which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in Earth and things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the father for [Music] [Music] amen you may have your seats please I'm happy to see brother OS today God bless you and been here for a while maybe three or four weeks and brother Baka uh has he stepped out where is he ah okay you notice I was calling brother Alan and then I said brother Baka because I was thinking about you I was in my heart I was saying oh I'm happy to see brother and I know there are several from kja also streaming with us Works inja in Moro uh I I think you work in the same organization with him I don't know whether you know that so uh but anyway we are so happy that brother B is here this so this morning I just want to speak to you on the subject of Grace to submit to his will or to God's will amen that's what I'm speaking about and um uh I have a lot of things to deal with and many scriptures to read but if you pray if if you if you pray for us the Lord will use us for your benefit you know a preacher is not the one that does the talking it should be God and the preacher only has a gift that he has to submit and God to use it so just that's why we say pray for us so we can be able to submit ourselves just as the Deacon said avoid as movements as much as you can Grace to submit to his will I also said we are reading out of James 4 but he giveth more grace wherefor he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to God uh resist the devil and he will flee from you [Music] verse eight Draw N to God and He will draw n to you cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts ye double minded be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up [Music] [Music] amen shall we say Amen into that all right so now um when we talk about um humility uh maybe today mainly I'm going to deal with two things uh humility and pride those are the main themes really but I I just want to take that subject Grace God gives us Grace to submit to his will now the reason why we read in the book of Philippians he says that let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus now he says who meaning Christ Jesus was in the form of God but he thought it not to be equal with God meaning he never made himself equal with God so what does he mean it means he was God but when he came down on Earth he never even made himself equal with God what am I saying you need to understand first of all the mystery of godliness how many gods do we have how many gods we do we have ch we have one God can you count him he's uncountable you can't count him can you place him in a bottle and you cover it up you cannot do that because he is omnipresent he is everywhere at the same time he's in heaven he's on Earth he's in you he's in me that is God the Bible in the Book of John 4:24 he says God is is a spirit so God is not something you can see with your eyes because he's a spirit but that God has been changing forms in order to contact Mankind in order to deal with us to accomplish certain things there was a time to the children of Israel he came in a burning bush when Moses saw him he knew that was the god Abraham met all right it's the same God and again when the children of Israel were moving from Egypt to the promised land the Bible says that same God would appear to them during day time in a form of a pillar of clown who was it it was the same God Abraham it was the same God Moses and now he had come in another form cloud and then at night that same God who appeared to them in a cloud he came in another form he appeared to them in a pillar of fire so by day the cloud By Night the pillar of fire but he was the same God they did not say God the cloud God the fire god pill of fire god the burning bush they simply said the god of Israel but when that God of Israel came and visited the human race Israel did not have a revelation of who he was when he came to them he came to them as a son of God and to them they knew they had the understanding that Son of God means God because a son of a cat a child of a cat is a cat a child of a dog is a dog a child of a cow is a cow what about a child of God he's God so when he spoke to the Pharisees and he told them he was a Son of God they said what you are a man and you make yourself God he never said he was God he simply said he was a Son of God but they had the understanding they had the Revelation to be a Son of God it means to be God himself and the Jews they couldn't stomach that they said they wanted to Stone him and one time they came back to him he said but tell us uh you know you know he told them he said before Abraham was I am they said what did you just say I am you remember how God came to Moses and he said I am I am I am so now here Jesus is say before Abraham was I am some of you are not even getting it here he did not say before Abraham I was there but he said before Abraham was I am meaning I was the one Abraham saw it's in the Book of John he actually said that Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he was glad and before Abraham was I am they said what did you just say did you you a man who is not even 50 years old how can you say you were there in the days of our patri how can you claim to be Jehovah God but he said if you do not believe I am he you will surely perish in your sins so who was Jesus Jesus was God in flesh Jesus is the Jehovah of the Old Testament let me put it this way the Jehovah of the Old Testament became the Jesus of the New Testament amen the word Jesus or the name Jesus means Jehovah our Salvation God our Salvation so Jesus was not a second person he was not a third person he was the person he was God himself dwelling in in the human race he came down from glory in the Book of John something I'm trying to come to Saints just give me time and and then you will see it in the Book of John if you can turn there if you will in the Book of John chapter 1 quickly now chapter one verse one he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was [Music] God so in the beginning was what the word who is the word are you here Church ask your neighbor are you here who is the word God all right let's look at verse 14 and the Word was made flesh who is the word God now verse 14 and the word and God was made flesh so Jesus yes was not the second person of the trinity if you search the whole Bible from cover to cover you will never find the word Trinity it is a word which was coined by Theologian Roman Theologian but it it has never been in the Bible the Bible simply says the word is God and the word was made flesh meaning God became a man God was made flesh and he dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten begotten of the father begotten how does God beget by the word how was Jesus born by the word he was not born by the last of the flesh but he was born by the word of God he simply spoke and the body was formed and here is another thing here another nugget for you this body of Jesus did not come from Mary or Joseph it came from God it was not the Egg of Mary he came from God God himself condescended and he put on the body of Flesh and dwelt Among Us and his name was called Jesus what does Jesus mean he said he said he shall also be called Emmanuel what does Emmanuel mean he says God With Us not the second person of the with us and in the book of First John chter 5 verse 7 thereabout he says there are three you can put the scripture up that bear witness or record in heaven the Father the word which is the Son and the Holy Spirit and these three one now there is something here I want to teach you the Trinity says father son Holy Spirit but father is not the son the son is not the Holy Spirit but each of them is God so in other words if each of them is God and each of them is a distinct person it means you have three gods but they tell us no no no they're not three Gods the three persons agre in one two two people come come up here I want to demonstrate something for you yeah you're getting blessings by helping me to demonstrate this thank you okay just stand there right brother now you have the first one there second one here third one here and now when you said this these people cannot be one but they can agree in one how many understand that they can agree to make a circle a circle do you know a CLE not a cirle a CLE yes they can agree to build a house they can agree but there are three distinct persons and each of them is Rich and each of them is powerful and that's the idea of the Trinity but what does the word of God tell us the word of God debunks this teaching and he says there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word the Holy Ghost these three are one not three in one but they are one what does that mean it's all right you can go back so it means that you have God as a spirit but he has manifested himself in three major manifestations he manifested himself as a father amen God of the Old Testament he came in many forms he spoke to the prophets you know they knew him as God the Father above us God above us but that same God who was above us came down the Bible says he put on flesh and he dwelt among so then he became the son but what does the word son mean it means human God became human he put on flesh all right I told you today I'll give you many scriptures in the Book of Malachi and these have not prepared they're just coming to me now this will excite you behold verse one I sent my m messenger and he shall prepare the way before me so now this is the father speaking okay he says that I'm sending a messenger he's talking about John the Baptist and he's going to prepare the way before me and the Lord the father whom ye seek shall suddenly come into His Temple meaning the Lord the father God the creator of Heaven and Earth you are seeking for him you Israel You're praying in the temple you're waiting upon him that God will come in his Temple what is the temple the temple was the body of Jesus if you're not getting it just listen one time Jesus was speaking with the Pharisees and he said destroy this temple in one day I will raise it in three days and all of them wanted to St him how can you talk about the temple the temp because the temple had three places the sanctuary the holy place and the holy of holies and in the holy of holies was God the presence of God sh Glory he was the Cherub beims were there and so there was God and the Jews knew that is the sacred place where God himself dwells and only the high priest can go there once in a year now when Jesus came he said destroy this temple in one I will destroy it I bring it up in three days the Jews were looking at the other T where God was dwelling but they did not know God had shifted God had changed his form he was no longer in that Temple he had now built for himself a temple not made with hands a temple made by the spoken word of God and that Temple was Jesus the body so he said destroy this body in three day I will raise it up and they did and Jesus rose up in three days so he said the Lord himself you are seeking for will suddenly come into His Temple and when this messenger came his name was John when he came then the Messiah Jesus came and Jesus was this temple of God if you understand it say amen and so God condescended put on flesh and dwelt Among Us and the Jews could not understand they said how can God become a man how can God the spirit we know our fathers worshiped him that's why the the Jews rejected Jesus listen listen that's why the Jews reject Jesus until today they rejected him by the way do you know who crucified [Music] Jesus it was the Jews who took him to the Romans and and and and the Roman Emperor said the man is Innocent but you know you know the people the Jews they say don't worry let his blood be upon us and our children for you you are okay so who crucified Jesus the Jews they rejected him why did they reject him because they couldn't understand they said he's a man and he's making himself God and one of them said he he wants to take the Throne of the Romans he's making himself a king and that's why they put for on him a crown of thorns can you imagine they put on him a crown of thorns simply because they thought he's making himself a king but they did not know this is the king of glory the God who created heaven and earth he had come down in a body of a human being they did not know that's why when this man asked him say tell me about your kingdom have you come to take over me the man Jesus answered you don't know what you're talking about my kingdom is not of this world Amen Jesus is the king of kings when we say Jesus is Lord we mean he's God we mean is the creator of Heaven and Earth and the Bible here in the book of Philippians he said he made but he was God but he did not make himself even equal with God he took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in that fashion as a man he humbled himself there is a principle I want to share with you today and I hope you don't lose it you don't miss it and if you feel you are a bit dosy just say Amen so that you don't do but I see many of you are very sober but if you're sober and you're not saying amen I know you're about to do hallelujah amen hallelujah amen well in this church we love the word every believer loves the word and how do you know someone loves what they enjoy it whether it is a teaching or a preaching so now we see here that he he he was found in a fashion as a man and he humbled himself he became obedient to death the death of the Cross he became obedient to death itself and the death of the Cross and because of that God exalt as highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that are the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and the things in Earth and the things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus is Lord to the glory of the father so who is the father the father is God above us what is his name Lord who is the son the son is God With Us what is his name Jesus who is the Holy Spirit is God in us what is his name Christ so what is the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit Lord Jesus Christ he had the fullness of God but I want you to imagine that even Jesus even while he was God he never could ever attain what he attained on Earth if he had not humbled himself there is nothing you can attain on Earth without humbling yourself God himself had to stoop so long come to our level in order for his name to be lifted and it says because he humbled himself his name is the name above every if you humble yourself in your family God will make your name great if you humble yourself in your Society in your place of work wherever you come from God will make you great this is what God does and you know there is no way you can believe the word of God without humbling yourself and the Bible says he giveth more grace you know where he says God resist the proud but he gives grace to the humble he gives Grace oh God make me humble amen the only way you can be able to submit yourself to the word of God to the teachings of the Bible by humbling yourself but how can you humble yourself you humble yourself by the grace of God it says I'm going to read this scripture in the Amplified version just listen says but he gives us more and more grace through the power of the Holy Spirit to defy sin and live an obedient life that reflects both our faith and our gratitude for our Salvation therefore it says God is opposed to the proud and the haunty but continually gives the gift of Grace [Music] not one time but continually he gives the gift of grace to the humble Contin today tomorrow the day after that he continually gives the gift of grace to the humble who turn away from self-righteousness Brother you do not need to become self-righteous [Music] you need to humble yourself if you are a sinner say I am a sinner if you not right say I am not right let me tell you the problem with Christianity the biggest problem and you have heard many people say Christians are the worst people because they're Hypocrites how many have heard of that uhuh even some people those of you who have businesses I know you cannot you cannot give brothers and sisters jobs employing Believers don't give I don't I don't borrow to brothers because the brother will not pay the sister not pay why why is it like that the reason is many Christians are actually Hypocrites they are proud they can't humble themselves they can't accept that we need to learn we are sinners we need help many times you go on the streets you want to preach the gospel no just go and preach to those ones for me I'm saved everybody feels they already pass and maybe even right now some of you are saying but what Pastor is preaching I don't need it someone else need but me I'm fine you need to humble yourself and when the word of God comes you need to open your hearts so that the word of God can come and he says submit so submit to the authority of God resist the devil or stand firm against him and he will flee from you come close to God with a contr heart and he will come close to you wash your hands you Sinners and pufy your Unfaithful hearts you double minded people be miserable and grieve and weep over your sin you find in in the churches of Christians someone can actually commit sin and remain in church and never grieve about their and they sing and they they greet each other and everything is fine how are you I am all right but when they living a rotten life of what causes that you tell me this because they can't break out of it I want to ask you a question church is the blood of Jesus powerful enough to take you out of your sin is it powerful enough but why do people stay in the presence of God and become even worse many times you just continue in your life you just continue in your wrong lifestyle and you're not bothered the reason for that is one pride pride but the Bible says here be miserable and grieve and weep these days you no longer have people weeping people even laugh at each other when the presence of God comes down and someone cries under that presence after church you will hear some young people laughing at you you saw you really you were messed up today what how dare you do that do you know you are coming close to blaspheming the Holy Spirit be miserable and grieve and we over your sin if you open your heart today for the next one hour I want to show you something let your foolish laughter be turned to mour believers who are sinners who are unrepentant who are proud they always love comedy always they love comedy they like laugh you even find them on social media they just pulling comedy after comedy they just want to laugh and laugh and laugh and do you know the reason why because they sad on the inside and they want to cover it up and with comedy many of those people who are comedians after they make you laugh they go at home to a life of misery to a life of bitter addiction to a life of depression many people who look for laughter are people who are truly depressed they always laugh around but their life is full of Miser their life is full of regrets their life is full of depression full of anxiety let me tell you my brother you don't need to cover yourself up you don't need to pass yourself up there is one thing you need to do he says be miserable and grieve and weep over your sin let your foolish laughter turn to mour and he says and your Reckless [Music] Joy let it be turned to Gloom and then he say humble yourselves I am going to show you examples of what I'm talking about it says humble maybe I I'll get to eat but let me go ahead of myself a little bit and give you this example here is a man his name was sa and sa was a king that God himself chose but you remember I think I will read it but I don't know let me just talk talk about it now CU I feel talk about it and this man you know he gave the offering he wasn't supposed to give the offering at that time and so he gave the offering and Samuel was the one supposed to give the offering how many have read of that before how many have not read okay so um maybe I'll read it let me give you the story here and then Samu and then when Samuel came as soon as he arrived he found this man had already given the sacrifice this man was a king he was not supposed to give the offering the it was supposed to be the the Prophet The Prophet to give the sacrifice so when you saw the people going away he called everybody he come let me give the sacrifice because the enemies are coming and we have not given the sacrifice so he made a mistake and he gave the sacrifice and when the prophet arrived he said what that you have done he started laughing you know people were leaving and I said to myself let me do it I have done it and that grieved God there is two kings here that we're going to look at today David and Saul why did God love one and and not and and and and and leave the other and [Music] and removed even he stripped the other one off of all the power he he even removed the Kingdom from his it was one thing friends pride May the Holy Spirit help us for me to impress upon you what he spoke to me he says humble yourselves with an attitude of repentance and insignificance in the presence of the Lord and He will exalt you and he will lift you up and he will give you purpose Saints today I'm going to give you a principle which if you live in or you live by you will live a life that is above everyone you will live a Victorious Life you will live a prosperous life but if you don't take this principle you will desire to be big and to achieve great things and successes but nothing will happen of all the things you've dream God gives grace to the humble this is done through the power of the Holy Spirit it is this power that helps us to defy sin and to leave un obedient life actually the Bible says here we revenge or we punish Disobedience if you can open second Corinthians chapter 10 I'm going to to read it from the Amplified so you just listen he says for though we walk in the flesh as mortal men we are not carrying on our spiritual warfare according to the Flesh and we are not using the weapons of man I have someone who is like that this morning amen I am not caring my spiritual warfare according to the flesh I am not using the weapons of a man the weapons of our Ware are not physical they are not physical weapons of Flesh and Blood our weapons are divinely powerful divinely oh my God divinely powerful Hallelujah when you fighting your enemy amen could be anything that you are glued to it could be a listen listen it could be a life of sin and you are so glued to it you feel you cannot break out of it why do Christians live defeated lives because they fight it in the flesh and blood from today I'm not going to do this again and until some of them give up they say for me I've tried my best God will understand he will forgive those who he will forgive you see because they're in the flesh me I can't overcome this but I'm trying to introduce something to you here which will help you to overcome he says the weapons of our faar and not physical weapons of flesh and blood but our weapons every say my weapon just say it on your mouth my weapon are divinely powerful they are divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses it destroys every Fortress go it says we are destroying sophisticated arguments and very exalted and proud thing that sets itself up against the true knowledge of God we are taking every thought and every purpose we are taking it captive to The Obedience of Christ being ready to punish Every Act of Disobedience when your own obedience as a church is complete now I want you to know that God hats the proud God resists Pride just listen to these things may God give us but I want to speak them that they will be deeper enter into you in this today's service my aim if you're not very excited but I want you to listen that the words these words will come and be inside of you listen first Peter 5 verse 5 likewise ye Young submit yourself to the Elder yeah all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resist the proud tell your neighbor God resist the proud and giveth grace to the humble he resists the proud he gives grace to the humble but our generation is not we want to big things we want to be seen I did it I am the man I people don't know about giving credit to each other you know even when you know that the other person really did that than you or did it a little more than you when you get a chance to speak you want to show everybody how great a person you are what you have done praise the name of the Lord what you have done what you are the ability that you have the power that you have but the Bible says we should submit we should be subject one to another and we should be closed with humility for God resists the proud but he gives grace to the humble and I want you to listen to this scripture in the Book of Proverbs chapter 6 verse 16 he says these six things does the Lord hat yeah seven un Abomination unto him number one a proud L yes a proud L you got it a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood let us take one by one the Bible says these things God does what if God hurts something and you you are a part of it it means you're on the negative side of God a proud look there are some people who can never humble themselves even their eyes sh you know one time I never plann to to cut this but but I just remember it now brother bam was speaking about a man finding a woman to marry and you know you know he was in a ranch somewhere and um he saw this C this C cow that really looked so nice and um and um he said my this is a beautiful cow I think it is the best and the man told him no no no no that is not don't look at the meat and the look of it and be deceived by that let me read it let me read it from the man himself William preached this in 1965 he said I used to go with a Rancher that I worked with to buy CLE and I noticed the old fellow always looking right in the face of a haer before he went to beaing young people you will love this story just listen to it very well and so then he turned her head and looked back and forth I followed him along and watched him and he looked her up and down if she looked all right the then he turned and looked her in the face and sometime he would shake his head and walk away I said Jeff I want to ask you something he said say on be I said why do you always look that cow in the [Music] face I said she looks all right said I want to tell you boy you got a lot to learn and I realized it after he told me he said I don't care how she's made up she might be be PL but if she's got that wild stair in her face don't you never buy her I said why so Jeff he said well say the first thing is she will never step put and he said the next thing is she will never be a mommy to her C and say they put her in a pen now that's the reason she's fat you turn her loose that wild stair she will run to death I said you know I kind of learned something I believe that applies to women too that wild St look [Music] there are some women when you look at them and they look at you in the face you will she's cating you she's very groomy this one is not a simple woman now and don't know they look at you and turn the eyes what what is going on here greeting her God bless you better stay away from her boy all that they all that they Bluff stuff over at top [Music] eyes I wouldn't want that I don't think that's becoming to a Christian I don't care how much the television and paper says it's pretty it is the most horrible looking hideous side that I ever seen in my life praise the name of the Lord where the Believers ought to shout and so he continues up here and he talked about that so but you know says you plan to look you have to plan now he's talking about young men who are going to Mar you have to plan you have to look and you have to pray when you are choosing for see we see by this the Word of Promise she the bride that a man would choose is going to reflect his character it reflects what is in the man now could you imagine a man filled with the Holy Spirit taking something like that to be a wife I just don't see it brother now maybe I'm just an old CR but you know I just can't understand that notice for it's going to reflect what's in him she's going to help him make his future home praise the name of the Lord you go read that message it's called the choosing of a bride is very very wonderful and so he says you know when you get to marry a woman like that with that proud look she can't even stay at home and be a mother your babies she doesn't even want to have the babies even if she had she doesn't want to breastfeed them she wants to run around in the car go here and there women in our generation no longer want to be mothers that's why you brother you must find a Christian woman because a Christian woman is ways different from the worldly women a woman who has been CH a woman who is virtuous a woman knows where she stands can you say Amen to that but when you go to see that proud look and then you go for that the Bible says God hates that proud look he also hats a lying Tong a lying Tong brother if you have a lying and hands and hands that shed innocent blood you may say well I've never murdered anybody but what do we have in our generation you see you find Babies still in the stomach and someone would decide to kill that baby and they you know will do things and they until the child dies what is it it is hands that shed innocent blood God hurts it another thing he hurts a heart that devises Wicked imaginations when you your imaginations are always evil are always Wicked you always plan evil for people others are happy oh brother and sister you are like we shall see Wicked imagination another thing he HS feet that be Swift in running to [Music] mischief and you are first to pay a bribe something as simple as a bribe on the road you know a police officer stops you you find a Believer quickly off your newspapers and you a Believer sincerely if you a Believer and you do that God is not happy with that is Fe that [Music] iswift false witness that speaks lies he that sth Discord among Brethren God hats these things you find there are some people who are very good are taking bad news taking gossip from this person to this person all of a sudden you begin to see people in the church are not liking each other what is happening when you go down you realize there are some some people who are working around the to S this among and then those people who looked to that old fisherman I want to quote something for you here and you know what they did he would have uh had some great degree to go by and he would have had something to glory in but God took nothing and made something out of it am that's the way God does he just takes the nothing to make something and when you when when you being can become nothing in your own sight you are becoming something in God and always remember this and always remember this the way up is down he that exalts himself shall be a best that he that humbled himself shall be exalted so in order to receive the grace of God for our lives we need humility God loves humility and God loves lifting up the humble brother if you know actually you can even say I sense God is going to lift me when you feel you have humbled yourself when you know there is an opportunity you would have lifted yourself but you left the the people to CL for somebody else whenever people C for somebody else and they don't CL for you then God is about to lift you and when God lifts you no man can bring you down that that is this is a big principle friends he likes he likes ashaming the proud many times Believers become self-righteous do you know that self-righteousness is a sin whereby you feel me I'm perfect me I'm okay me I'm fine I don't need help I don't need to pray they going for prayers I let the Sinners go me I'm okay when we say it's not time for prayer others will say let the me I'm okay I don't now I have nothing to pray for it's a self-righteous in the Book of Luke if you can turn there now chapter 18 verse [Music] 9 and they spake this Parable unto certain unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous despised others two men went up into the temple to pray the one a Pharisee and the other a the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself God I thank thee that I am not as other men are extortioners unjust doubter or even as this public I fast twice in the week I give ties of all that I possess and the standing a far off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but SM upon his breast and he's saying Lord God be merciful to me a sinner I tell you this man went down to this to his house justifi rather than the other for everyone that exalted himself shall be a best and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted hallelujah amen for God to operate in your life you need to be humble for you to be able to acknowledge your sin you need to be humble you need humility to overcome even sin you need humility to receive correction I see some people when they correcting and they become so offended do do it do it do it for your do it for yourself I didn't Pian okay it's okay I will not play it anymore Pride made was something to say way BR it out it didn't treat me well because it seems you are talking [Music] about go and look for another person go and look for another person if I'm treating you bad pride pride your mother your father talks to you and tries to correct you why don't you always wash T children like PR you need humility to receive correction I'm speaking may not excite you but they will change you you need humility re cor whether you are a husband or whether you are a wife some men think because they are husbands NOS to them when your wife begins talking to you about something then you say how dare you I am your husband shut up some men they even fear them in their homes the moment they arrive everybody will take off others they will hide under the children it means you are beh Liv as Herod in your home you have a a wrong Spirit on you and it's called pride pride is not a good thing but when you are humble you will receive correction hallelujah amen I remember there was a day I had hosted by the Tim do and uh there was another brother from um Pastor his Da comes to this church she's brother Tim when he was preaching he mentioned the name of a certain man and then ascribed him to being somebody and then later on brother Char came to him he told Tim is from Canada don't know so both of them are old men so this one came to this one I told him when you were preaching you mentioned this man and ascribed him to being so but it is not true this man is actually somebody else and I was there standing watching and was like ah so oh thank you God bless you it took me all the way to come from Canada to come and learn this in Uganda thank you God but if it is a proud preacher like ah okay I already knew I just made was sleep of a tongue because you don't want to be brought down but brother Believers should break down believer should accept [Music] correction believer should accept to Lear but you see without humility you can never learn anything new you need humility even to understand the will of God for your life if you don't humble yourself you cannot learn anything new about your life from God praise the name of the Lord I remember I was in Ethiopia one day in many people at that time they couldn't speak English let alone understand it because they communicate the official language is Amar so there came up the sister brought me a certain preacher and I was um I was preaching to him I was I was supposed to like share the message with him and so um we sat together the three of us and um I asked this brother before I started through sister The Interpreter do you need interpretation or you okay with them I'm fine I understand everything so I preached to him for 1 hour and a half we were talking about certain things and um after that I think my wife was there too at that time and so after that I asked him the whole time he was yeah so after when hour house I asked him what do you say about this and he started talking about something completely different the whole one hour and a half was wasted never Le anything why Pride but if you humble yourself if you don't know say I don't know if you need something say I need God cannot use you if you are proud you can't be a good wife if you're proud you can't be a good husband if you're proud you can't be church member if you're proud you can't be a a good servant of God if you're proud you have to humble yourself let us look at a few verses about Pride look at Psalms 10:4 he says the wicked through the pride of his continence will not seek after God God is not in all his thoughts you just interpret this directly my brother the wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek after God God is not in all his thoughts proverbs 14:3 in the mouth of the foolish is a road of Pride but the lips of the wise shall preserve them meaning the wise are the humble proverb 16 Verse 18 Pride goth Before Destruction if you are always you know up there you know it all you cannot break down you cannot be told you think you're on top of your game destruction is coming to you Pride goes before destruction and hold spirit before a fall better it is to be an of an humble spirit with the low than to divide the spoil with the proud you can read that out of um Proverbs chapter 16 18 and 19 [Music] [Music] read that again verse [Music] 19 praise the name of the Lord look at look at proverbs 2923 listen it says a man's Pride shall bring him law but horor shall uphold the humble in spirit Proverbs 88:13 the fear of the Lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and and the evil way and a forward mouth do i h mouth no one knows that luganda word is very difficult for people to understand but out I say it's um somebody who is difficult to deal with some who is er like contradictory and and and talking and fasing and AR speing words I don't know how many of you have ever spoken to someone and you felt sick how many have spoken to such a person where are you that person you know sometimes you can speak to a person and you feel sick because of their words to you that's a someone with a frowed mouth someone just come up and abuse you you look like a pan stupid you are don't sense and those words when they come out of that mouth they make you sick you feel so bad but the Bible says the fear of the Lord is to Hur evil is to Hur pride is to Hur arrogance and the evil way and the forward mouth and God hats it and I want you now to give you this example which I showed you here in the book of 1 Samuel chapter 13 quickly we can read all of us there if you can turn there for Samuel 1 and he carried seven days according to the set time that Samuel had appointed but Samuel came to gilgal and the people were scattered from him and Saul said bring hether a burn offering to me and peace offerings and he offered the burn offering and it came to pass that as soon as he made an end of an of the offering of the burnt offering behold Samuel came and Samuel and Saul went out to meet him that he might salute him and Samuel said what hast thou done and Saul said because I saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou camest not with within the days appointed and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Mish there said I the Philistines will come down now upon me to gilgal and I have not made supplication unto the Lorden the words I forced myself and I offered a bur offering and Sam said to Saul thou has done foolishly thou Hast not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God which he commanded thee for now would the Lord have established th Kingdom upon Israel forever but now the kingdom shall not continue the Lord s him a man after his own heart and the Lord has commanded him to be Captain over his people because thou has not kept that which the Lord commanded now I want I want I want to examine this situation here executing a duty that does not belong to you is a pride I remember many times even when I was still in Miana many years ago I was assisting the pastor there as an associate and then some of the a few characters they would even come and visit my home my wife remembers that and you know they would sit down with you they would begin telling you you know brother when you preach I feel very happy I think you should even become our pastor and then after they say that they keep qu and look at you what are they waiting for they are waiting for you to St up with pride and say yes yes I've even been planning on it and then they will take the words brother said he wants to be and someone came up say the way I've heard you preaching I even want to give you my ti don't give it to the p and I I I whenever these cases would come to me i' rebuke them sharply is an opportunity for Pride Brethren pride is real and pride destroys Pride destroys I remember one time brother told me someone was streaming our services and they and they called him oh you a real man of God I even want to begin paying my ta you so so he came to me and said pastor there is some sheep in some country they have confidence in my Ministry what can I do brother it's a Temptation stay in your place know your calling do not overstep your boundary God uses all of us you may be young you may be old you may be big you may be small you may be rich you may be poor God uses all of us the same but you see Samuel was a prophet and sa was a king and so he waited how many days seven days and Samuel did not come samel did not come and the man felt like when the people when the enemies of Israel were coming he felt like oh they're going to come and attack us what don't I have don't I have the hand don't I have the feet don't I have the knowledge don't I know how they sacrifice he told the boys come bring me bring me those haers and he started sacrificing there were a priest would do and then the prophet arrived as soon as he had finished the job and when that happened when that happened I wanted to hear those words that the prophet of God said and Samuel said to Saul thou Hast done foolishly thou Hast not kept the Commandment of the Lord which he commanded thee for now would the Lord have established th Kingdom up upon Israel forever but now om shall not continue I want to tell you friends it is impossible to have obedience without humility Rebellion is a nasty sin before the Lord because you see he says you know as the Lord as does the Lord have great Delight in Bur offerings and sacrifices [Music] as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hecken than the fat of Rams for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubborness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou H has rejected the word of the Lord also rejected the from being I want to emphasize this God gives grace to the humble tell your neighbor God gives grace to the H he said here in the Book of James he gives more and more and more and more and more grace through the power of the Holy Spirit to defy sin and and to live an obedient life that reflects both our faith and our gratitude for our Salvation therefore it says God is opposed to the proud and halty but continually I underline this part continually continually gives grace to the humble did you know if you are humble in heart even when you go wrong he will redeem you out of that if your heart is cont if your spirit is humble in the Book of Matthew it says he he he he he he he those things from the wise and The Prudent of the world and he revealed it to babes such as would Lear God always reveals the deep secrets of his word to the humble those who can learn wait wait there's a principle here I'm trying to give if you are proud you can never learn anything of the Lord but if you are humble even when you go wrong he will always bring you if your spirit can be corrected did God take away the Kingdom from sa because sa was proud his heart was hurt he thought he knew everything he thought he was the king and he can do anything he wanted to do brother you always need to know your place and your calling and you humble yourself and and and before we finish I have a few offices I want to touch on but God has called I believe it takes each of us the Bible tells us to submit to the authority of God but how can we submit to God if we can't submit to ourselves let me first take the first office the office of children how many are children here if you're a parent don't I'm talking about the children raise up your hands I'm going to talk to youan 6 verse1 children obey your parents in the law for this is right honor thy father and mother is the first commandment with promise oh my father is difficult my mother no he said obey submit yourself hon your father hon your mother children can you shout Amen on that that it may be well with the and as a servant of God I can tell you it cannot be well with you if you do not honor your father and you will die young if you want to live long and if you want to be well with you submit yourself to your parents in the Amplified it says children obey your parents in the Lord that is accept their guidance and accept their discipline as God is representative is that right your parents are God's Representatives it doesn't matter what you think about it doesn't matter what you feel about it matters what God says you have to submit your parents you have to obey your parents for this is right for obedience teaches wisdom and self discipline he says honor esteem value as precious your father and your mother and be respectful to them this is the first commandment with a promise praise the name of the Lord and when we talk about the ministry you know they come preach to you the word of God and your pastors deacons and others listen it says Hebrews 13 obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give [Music] account and he says let them help them that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you one brother once said if your pastor is happy with you then God is happy with you but if your pastor is angry with you God is angry with you why he says submit yourselves to them that have the rule over why because they watch for your souls and they will give an account did you know pastors are going to give account to all those people that God brought into their [Music] hands now that shows you how should a pastor you know TW let me read this for you it says brother bam was explaining what Jack Mo told him one time and he said Jack Mo said to me one time I would to have to answer like like you will have two at the day of judgment said God has put these people into your hands and you're going to give an account for every one of them you are going to answer for your ministry praise praise the name of the Lord fathers parents you are going to answer for your children you're going to answer for your children you're going to give an account how you raised them husbands you are going to answer for your wives because she's a part of you the says you are the head and body like you know so you're going to answer for your wife and you know at one point he said these men who leave their wives to just go dress anyhow imag they leave their W to dress you know those mini SCS and those and they go on the road and they pollute our generation do you know it was wrong for a woman to dress a trouser how many knew that that was wrong it is wrong the Bible says a woman shall not wear that which pertain unto a man and one person told me one time no there is a trous of women and a trous of men and I and I also told them can you as a woman wearing a trouser go in a toilet which has a how do they call that thing sign and that which shows a man has limbs separated as a trouser and that of a woman it shows a scar so now you who is a woman wearing a trouser can you enter that place where you cannot even Common Sense will tell you that is a man but they have sin so far away that even their Common Sense cannot teach them that I have told you many times growing up not many years ago not many years ago I don't know how many here were part of that those who were part of that generation when women started wearing that trous you know we would go behind them and we small children some of us were not even wearing shirts and were clapping how many saw that some people they did in the societies until a girl would feel so sorry for she would have to go back and change it and put on a a skirt or a dress because the children have having been taught by nobody conscious told them that a woman doesn't dress like that but today they dress like that and they even come in church some of them are worship leaders and they come in the church and they begin throwing their around oh Jesus that is not the yes of the Bible the yes of the Bible is very orderly the yes of the Bible believes in women being decent decent men come out of the World when they are full of last they come in the church they go away moreful than they came why because of how women are dressed want to say thank God for this message that has given us sanity it has made our women cover their themselves hallelujah amen what told that the Holy Spirit you know they claim to have the Holy Spirit if you have the Holy Spirit he will teach you how to dress he teach you how to dress you remember that man who was in the tombs of GAD how he was naked what was wrong with him how many remember what was wrong with him he had demons in him demons make people [Music] naked not teaching demons it makes people naked and then this preachers who the Bible says they have become preachers of righteousness but they are not sent by God they tell them it is okay God doesn't care about your dresses he car about your soul what is in the inside of you will be showed on the outside and and this man was was naked but when Jesus came when Jesus come all the demons disappear the Bible says when he came he cast out those demons and as soon as they left the man started pulling clothes he said bring cloes shower him and dress him up hallelujah amen when you receive Jesus in your life you will shower you will you will you will remove all that kind of thing that the world has put on you and you will dress her and you will dress her you will dress up that is why when you look around all the churches of True Believers our precious sisters have showered make up away from their faces they have been cleaned up by the water of the world and they have dressed and covered their for the glory of God so men are responsible for their wives dressing like that the Bible says a man that shall look at a woman to last after her already committed just by seeing so she is and him both oh my but I thank God for this word friends because it has opened our eyes to see praise the name of the Lord and so the scripture would continue on I'll just skip a few things here and talk about wives the Bible speaks about in the book of Ephesians 5 wives submit yourselves unto your own [Music] husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let their wives be to their own husbands in everything now I want you to hear the the Amplified version it says wives be subject be submissive and adapt yourselves [Music] to your and adapt yourselves to your husbands as let it be as a service to the Lord for the husband is the head of the is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church himself the savior of his body as the church is subject to Christ so let wives also be in subjection in sorry let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands one one sister one time told me did you just saying everything and I also say it is not me that said it it is the Bible that said it let wives be subject in what oh that is so weak sisters in every word is that the Bible is that the Bible ask your neighbor is that the Bible that is the Bible in everything one time there came up a sister in in the meeting church service and spoke to brother and brother husband is a bad man is's not a Christian and he told me I should stop coming to the meeting the tacle what should I do if you're the pastor what you ADV sister go first but the prophet of God answered said sister dear honor your husband and respect him and submit you can be a better Christian at home than in the church stay where he wants you and be the best of a Christian that you know your life will present to him Jesus Christ your life and you know in a little time the man he began watching his wife began watching his wife and that life impacted his life and changed him and he gave his life to Jesus Christ and both of them started coming to church praise the name of the Lord so what is happening with our generation they will tell the women oh that one is a Believer leave him come and we will give you another one his brother his wife was disturbing and you have you have many cases like that you know the prophet gave me another husband me another wife when you make your vows whether whether you agree or disagree until praise the name of the Lord and what there a lot of wrangles is submission that you cannot find that you know uh the man doesn't know his place and the woman fails to understand her place but you see the power to submit comes from Grace or of being humble when you humble yourself then you can submit but if you can't H yourself subm is difficult I'm telling you the truth not only in marriage anywhere else submission without humility is impossible it is impossible why submit yourselves to your own husbands it is fit in the Lord husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them amen Brothers you find some men who are very bitter you know because you know the man is called a lion my children called me a lion at home because you think you are the king which of course you are and your wife is the queen so how can you now begin raising your voice and shouting at the queen even when the children are there watching I told you and all the children began be not bitter against them wives submit yourselves unto your own husband as unto the Lord and here in Brackets the Amplified says because he is your [Music] lord how many knows that that's right your husband is your lord sister this one is your lord if you disobey him and don't submit you have even if you pray your prayers are for n if you don't want to have another Lord apart from Jesus don't get married amen my sisters but if you want to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and go to heaven and you get married then that is your first La by submitting to him you are submitting unto the Lord that's why before you accept you must make sure that is submittable to he himself has submitted himself to his Lord who is Jesus Christ praise the Lord I read for you a quote here from the message we would see Jesus I'm approaching to finish now says just like why does a woman every time she gets married on her face because she's coming to her husband just like Rebecca did she put a veil over her face to meet Isaac she has no more head ISAC is head and the church ought to be so submissive to the word of God that it veils the church WIll Veil its own face it has no more head the nature of a woman is to submit to a man and that's what the church ought to be doing also submitting to Christ to his word to his Doctrine to his principles she takes no thought for herself she has no head of herself Christ is her head not some exell doal church bch denomination kind of teachings but Christ is our head Christ the word and the Word was made flesh and DT Among Us Jesus Christ is the same yester forever that same manifestation of the word praise the name of the Lord my my my in the Amplified Jam says come close to God with a contrite heart and he will come close to you wash your hands you Sinners and purify your Unfaithful Hearts you double minded people be miserable grieve weep over your sin let your foolish laugh be turned to morning and your Reckless joy to groom humble yourself with an attitude of repentance and insignificance I tell you a story here brother bam one time you know we preach to Believers like this had a gift of healing so and also Visions so you see a vision maybe the angel of the Lord would come over somebody and then a vision will break out but when was in believer's churches it was very difficult because he would struggle with people have faith fa but when he went to South Africa many people who even were Catholics when he came and they came in the presence of God they began opening and the angel of the Lord moved impa it is in history Cars and Cars of CR whe chair people who were healed some of them were transported from hospitals but they were healed so Believers are self right but Catholics and many of those people who we think are not believers they are sincere God operates upon sincerity upon humility and I want to finish with this Ahab Ahab story here and show you how God was able to come down we know many of us we know Ahab as a man who was a bad person who was not a good believer but let me when I was reading I was actually amazed I want you to open your Bible to the book of First Kings 21 verses 25 but there was none like unto Ahab which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord whom Jezebel his wife St up and he did very abominably in in following Idols according to all things as did as did the amorites whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel you can begin reading from verse 25 2125 friends I'm closing with this I want you to pay attention I want you to see man who is a backslid Believer and married an unbeliever now the Bible says that Ahab sold himself to work wickedness in the sight of God and then not as if that was not enough jeel his wife an nonbeliever was starting up things so you have a man who backl and a woman who is an nonbeliever and starting up and he did now this is Ahab he did very abominably in in following Idols according to all things as did the amorites whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel and it came to pass when Ahab had heard those words that he rent his clothes and put sa upon his flesh and fasted and lay in sackcloth and went softly when this man had the Judgment of God which was negative about his life what did he do he broke down I'm giving you a principle if there is anything you have been praying for wanting God and you're not receiving it maybe you are self rightous maybe you're proud and I'm giving you a principle breaking down in the presence of God this man no he was actually according to the scripture he was the worst sinner but when he heard the Judgment of God upon his life the Bible says he he fasted he put on sackcloth he rent his clothes you know he went softly he humed himself and the word of the Lord came to Elijah the ti by saying do you see how has humed himself before for me because he humbles himself before me that one word because he hum himself before me I will not bring evil in his days but you see the word of God had already gone forth and the kingdom you know was already divided and you know and God was already with this man but he told him because this man has humbled himself evil will not come in his days but I will bring it in in the future upon his house because the word of God does not fail once it has come out two things I want to finish with number one the children of Israel when God when they grieved God for being proud and for not humbling themselves to what Moses was telling them God became angry and he said Moses I'm going to kill all of them H Moses pleaded he said oh God what will the others think please forgive them now it appeared God had forgiven them but actually they all died in the [Music] desert all of them only two JHU and so still the word of God was accomplished so one thing I want you to learn today that before the wrath of God comes upon your life humble yourself let not God declare anything negative upon your life do not permit it to happen because if it happens okay and you humble yourself after that yes he will forgive you but you will suffer the consequences because the word that comes out of his mouth cannot return before it accomplishes what but number two this man humbled himself he said God have mercy he repented he he put on sack cloth he went softly before the Lord and God spoke this word because he has humbled himself because he has humbled himself because he has humbled himself now did you know humbling yourself will give you the favor of God in your life you may be the worst of Sinner but because you humble yourself in his presence that is all it takes for God to take from one level to another let us stand on our feet let us pray as the musicians come now I'd like to ask a question because the word of God does not return unto him void it accomplishes that which it has been sent to do maybe there is an area that you need to humble yourself in maybe you are a child and you need to humble yourself maybe you are a parent and you need to humble yourself before the Lord maybe you know you've been hearing the word many times you say well I've heard the word it's been talking about me it's been talking about me but your life doesn't change because you don't humble yourself to sincerely repent sincerely come before the Lord and make yourself right with him I wonder if we still have people who can break down in his presence and say Lord I'm wrong here I need help here I need you to help me on this area I need you to help me in this area that area maybe you are a wife and you need humility the way up is the way the Way Up Is Down you need to humble yourself order for the Holy Spirit to lift you God loves lifting The Humble that he specializes in that but he also brings down the proud in heart how many here maybe with all our heads bound we want to say Lord I've been proud here I've not been listening enough I need to humble myself forgive me help me to be a better man a better woman a better Christian a better believer I'd like to pray for you father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I'd like to thank you for your grace for your mercies which you have bestowed upon us today and for the people that have been under the sound of my voice these are words perhaps s that may sound like a rebuke but Lord you know for whom it has come and Lord if a child of God would hear the word of God they would desire to be like that I pray that you will help each one of us to H and submit ourself Before the Throne before the king of Lord Lord Jesus you know each one each life father the people that are here today Lord may you touch each life may you help each one may you draw us into your presence that we will
