[1:40:56] show me a scripture where the Bible says
[1:41:06] foreign
[1:41:41] this word
[1:41:44] this gospel if the Bible says that even
[1:41:49] the angels
[1:41:51] hold their places
[1:42:01] how about a pastor Adam
[1:42:07] the Bible says the blind leads the blind
[1:42:11] all of them will end up in that disha
[1:42:23] thank God foreign
[1:42:53] they are working within the framework of
[1:42:55] the church
[1:43:06] when the world became flesh
[1:43:09] in Jesus
[1:43:12] the other side also known that way the
[1:43:15] world became flesh in Judas
[1:43:24] and that's why it takes the Revelation
[1:43:28] blood and flesh did not reveal today
[1:43:32] so they are presuming because they have
[1:43:36] a big congregation
[1:43:38] that God is in their middies
[1:43:43] God is in his word
[1:43:47] amen God honors this word

[1:46:05] presented something looked away from
[1:46:08] nice
[1:46:11] presumed because
[1:46:24] it wasn't the word
[1:46:29] foreign

[1:49:23] son
[1:49:27] foreign
[1:50:09] that devil can never have pity on you if
[1:50:12] resumed yet it is
[1:50:18] because Saturn presented something nice

[1:52:15] foreign
[1:52:32] no matter if you stand and remember men
[1:52:35] that ever done anything for God stood
[1:52:38] alone with the Gods

[1:53:31] to this place where God in his mercy and
[1:53:33] in his grace and mercy are forgiven
[1:53:36] their sins of all Disobedience
[1:53:45] after Miracles and after Miracles God
[1:53:48] said I have showed Mighty sign among
[1:53:50] them
[1:53:51] again
[1:53:56] and in the preceding verses I have shown
[1:53:58] my design and they have ignored all
[1:54:01] these signs
[1:54:07] they just walk right on through anyhow
[1:54:11] Bob
[1:54:14] did what they wanted to do
[1:54:24] not what God Said to do
[1:54:28] foreign
[1:54:32] we are not supposed to do what we ought
[1:54:35] to do the truth but what God wants us
[1:54:41] amen we are somebody's life
[1:54:46] we are somebody's Prisoners
[1:54:49] the Lord Jesus
[1:54:52] we eat what Jesus want us to eat
[1:54:55] we go where he want us to go
[1:54:58] we do what you want us to do
[1:55:02] we don't presumed that today there is a
[1:55:06] and those who are don't think I will
[1:55:08] call your name
[1:55:12] blessed be the name of the Lord you are
[1:55:15] presuming that you have come for service
[1:55:20] don't presume
[1:55:25] amen Amina
[1:55:28] we have to pass beyond presuming
[1:55:33] we have to be sure

[1:55:41] Miracles will happen
[1:55:44] will it take place
[1:55:47] we will have Victory
[1:55:50] amen and that is what we want to
[1:55:57] so this man after God performed signs
[1:56:00] and wonders
[1:56:02] and they prayed from God they presumed
[1:56:07] that God was within them
[1:56:12] blessed be the name of the Lord no
[1:56:15] that's where the difference is
[1:56:17] we think and we ought to do and God says
[1:56:21] do it some other way fatula was
[1:56:28] must come back and do it God's way to
[1:56:31] come away
[1:56:33] if God's word says repent
[1:56:36] he baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:56:42] you must do it God's way
[1:56:47] not because
[1:56:52] sprinkling is the same
[1:56:54] um
[1:56:57] yeah
[1:56:57] presuming
[1:57:00] that is the end point of everything
[1:57:04] and that's what matters
[1:57:18] all those things are good
[1:57:21] what matters here is Walking with God
[1:57:26] that's living for God
[1:57:30] a full service

[2:01:28] for the kingdom of God is
[2:01:37] presumed that they had him

[2:07:46] preserve their paint on their lips
[2:07:53] because you don't want your lips
[2:08:01] they speak they sing as if they have no
[2:08:04] teeth that is not our God

[2:09:24] the children never went to police
[2:09:31] have you ever read anywhere in the Bible
[2:09:33] and say that Elijah was announced as a
[2:09:35] missing person
[2:09:51] because they were spiritual
[2:09:56] father will take him

[2:12:17] not sure whether you are walking with
[2:12:18] God
[2:12:37] and his grace just kept holding for them
[2:12:40] and holding for them
[2:12:43] and then he came to and then he came to

[2:13:56] alone but God knows how he does this
[2:13:59] God never called us to look at the
[2:14:01] situation around
[2:14:05] look at him
[2:14:08] and as long as our eyes are on the Lord
[2:14:11] we are winning

[2:14:16] the problem
[2:14:17] the battles we are fighting the problems

[2:34:50] between sympathy and compassion
[2:34:56] there are two different words all
[2:34:58] together and we use them the same
