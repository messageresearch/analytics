[1:16:30] of so this morning by the grace of
[1:16:36] God he has given us an opportunity to be
[1:16:41] here myself and team of Three
[1:16:47] Brothers really before because our
[1:16:49] brother Ed also joined
[1:16:53] us praise
[1:16:56] pra and also
[1:16:59] brother yeah brother danand Dan we
[1:17:03] started on our journey to uh
[1:17:06] to t
[1:17:10] region we we that was
[1:17:13] Monday and we arrived there Monday
[1:17:16] night so on Tuesday
[1:17:19] morning we we we were given an
[1:17:22] opportunity to meet uh more than 100
[1:17:28] pastors from all over
[1:17:33] T who had come to meet with
[1:17:37] us and um you know and also receed
[1:17:41] books so we were I was speaking to
[1:17:44] them about the importance of the
[1:17:48] message
[1:17:49] and um not only the importance of the
[1:17:52] message that we have received
[1:17:55] but also the importance of reading and
[1:17:57] listening to the
[1:18:00] message and um also we took with us um
[1:18:05] close to 2000 Church age
[1:18:11] books was translated by our translation
[1:18:17] team uh into ATO
[1:18:20] language so we now actually we've
[1:18:23] translated very many messages
[1:18:28] I remember when we were that team I
[1:18:31] [Music]
[1:18:32] was at that time he was working with me
[1:18:35] like brother
[1:18:37] Dan and they we had we made a team of
[1:18:42] about
[1:18:43] five so they've translated almost more
[1:18:46] than 200
[1:18:48] messages into a t but the church ede
[1:18:52] book this specific Church ede book was
[1:18:53] done many years ago
[1:18:57] [Music]
[1:18:59] but it was out of
[1:19:02] print so we just put it back again into
[1:19:06] print and and our brothers before that
[1:19:09] edited it actually Pastor is the one who
[1:19:15] edited so um so we we we met also the
[1:19:20] translators and um we we had a little
[1:19:23] talk with them
[1:19:26] uh clal Bible Way has been sponsoring
[1:19:29] the um uh the translation and the
[1:19:33] printing of the
[1:19:37] message but they only can translate only
[1:19:40] only only so
[1:19:44] many so but they've done a good
[1:19:48] work because they don't read the our
[1:19:50] languages but they they give the money
[1:19:52] for that
[1:19:57] amen we need to give them a CL
[1:20:01] for
[1:20:03] but so I spoke to the
[1:20:06] ministers the pastors the
[1:20:09] translators about the need of having to
[1:20:12] now bring the burden over to the local
[1:20:15] people
[1:20:19] now so that now everyone can contribute
[1:20:24] just you know came off with that idea it
[1:20:26] just came to me at that moment as we
[1:20:28] were
[1:20:30] discussing and I asked them how much can
[1:20:32] each contribute if we were to ask every
[1:20:34] individual to
[1:20:39] contribute and one brother said a
[1:20:42] figure when we multiplied it we noticed
[1:20:45] it can continue to sustain the
[1:20:49] translation so I will not speak much
[1:20:51] being that we have not brought it to the
[1:20:53] pastors yet and we also so the pastors
[1:20:55] need to bring it to their
[1:21:00] people theyed over about 2,000
[1:21:05] books they took around took to their
[1:21:08] churches also from
[1:21:11] there we before we continued to carja We
[1:21:14] visited a
[1:21:17] family been streaming our services
[1:21:21] here and uh if you remember there is a
[1:21:24] brother who contacted me through the
[1:21:25] contact of sister
[1:21:30] Stella this time around we were able to
[1:21:33] go and visit him his
[1:21:36] family he owns some I think it's like a
[1:21:39] dispensary or I don't I
[1:21:44] don't so we visited him and shared the
[1:21:48] message he's an
[1:21:51] Anglican and he decided to be baptized
[1:21:55] in the name of our Lord
[1:21:57] Jesus so um unfortunately we never had a
[1:22:03] moment to conduct the
[1:22:05] baptism but we trust that the Lord will
[1:22:08] continue following up that that brother
[1:22:10] will probably meet again with his
[1:22:14] family so from there we continued to
[1:22:19] kja now is a whole different
[1:22:23] story because the people there are
[1:22:26] more the pastors were
[1:22:28] more the needs were more we literally
[1:22:32] ran
[1:22:34] away because no one wanted us to
[1:22:37] leave but we had to be here this
[1:22:40] weekend and um also of course the many
[1:22:45] other
[1:22:47] factors that couldn't allow us to stay
[1:22:51] for
[1:22:53] longer uh but we we met in t we met I I
[1:22:57] was just estimating but probably I did
[1:22:59] not get a chance to look at the
[1:23:03] registration but I am certain it was
[1:23:05] more than 200
[1:23:08] pastors and these came from all the
[1:23:11] regions
[1:23:14] of uh one region that did not send
[1:23:16] someone is
[1:23:19] a um
[1:23:25] but also I spoke to the brother there
[1:23:27] who is planting a church
[1:23:30] there brother jrey has s Le for us in
[1:23:33] one of the youth
[1:23:36] meetings so we um we sent
[1:23:40] him do we remember how many books we
[1:23:42] sent
[1:23:44] him which is how many
[1:23:50] books do the math and let me know so we
[1:23:53] we we sent we sent him several
[1:23:54] um hundreds of
[1:23:57] books into we this translation was done
[1:24:01] from scratch by our team
[1:24:06] there the the team we made of about five
[1:24:09] people as
[1:24:12] well and they have been translating the
[1:24:15] message
[1:24:17] into yeah we sent him 168
[1:24:21] books but the the books we took in
[1:24:27] 5,000
[1:24:29] books wait all these 5,000
[1:24:32] books are going to be given to
[1:24:36] believers who can
[1:24:38] read so there other believers who cannot
[1:24:41] read so you can imagine how many
[1:24:44] Believers are
[1:24:46] in isn't it
[1:24:48] amazing it's
[1:24:50] amazing there quite very many believers
[1:24:54] from all regions we met we met pastors
[1:24:56] from all
[1:24:58] regions I don't have the districts on
[1:25:00] here but I can remember if
[1:25:03] few um is the T side
[1:25:07] UMO um you know napak nap Moro and um
[1:25:13] you remember some districts several
[1:25:15] other
[1:25:16] districts I have the list of them here
[1:25:18] so they all came and we had a very
[1:25:20] wonderful conversation with them
[1:25:24] we we diverted a little bit in our
[1:25:31] conversation because these pastors
[1:25:33] coming together some others did not want
[1:25:35] others to be in the
[1:25:40] meeting because they were saying those
[1:25:42] ones have a wrong
[1:25:45] Doctrine and they had excommunicated
[1:25:47] them and when you talk to them you also
[1:25:50] hear that there's a problem with the
[1:25:51] other people's understanding of the
[1:25:53] message
[1:25:57] so you found there are many
[1:26:00] issues uh but um these are people who
[1:26:04] truly love the
[1:26:06] message uh but by God's grace they were
[1:26:09] all able to stay in the
[1:26:12] meeting and one thing I told the
[1:26:14] ministers the pastors
[1:26:16] there is that the message correct the
[1:26:20] error you see it was good that all of
[1:26:23] them stayed
[1:26:25] all of them received the message let
[1:26:27] them go and read it the message will
[1:26:29] correct the wrong
[1:26:31] doc the more you read the message the
[1:26:33] more you understand the message
[1:26:37] properly there were some other ministers
[1:26:39] that wanted us to stay because they had
[1:26:41] issues also with the understanding of
[1:26:42] the
[1:26:46] message wanted us to discuss a little
[1:26:49] more with other
[1:26:52] pastors uh especially on the issue of
[1:26:56] hair it's a very big problem
[1:26:59] there and and marriage I think and
[1:27:05] divorce but um I wasn't constrained to
[1:27:08] stay I felt I needed to
[1:27:12] move God's grace we shall
[1:27:16] return this brother told me pointed at
[1:27:18] me
[1:27:19] said you have gone
[1:27:22] but I also failed I needed to stay
[1:27:25] but I wasn't constrained to
[1:27:29] stay so uh butth the brothers know what
[1:27:32] I'm talking
[1:27:34] about literally we
[1:27:37] escaped uh because the need there is
[1:27:41] great not the need for
[1:27:43] money or for water and food but the need
[1:27:47] for the
[1:27:49] one they need for the
[1:27:51] word so we need how many are going to
[1:27:53] pray for
[1:27:56] amen the pastors there have a big heart
[1:27:58] for
[1:28:01] god um actually I spoke to them
[1:28:05] also about now translating the message
[1:28:08] into their own language by
[1:28:11] themselves and they told me they let
[1:28:13] they will update me but they
[1:28:17] agreed imagine Believers there will
[1:28:19] begin contributing money
[1:28:24] to support their
[1:28:27] translators to translate the
[1:28:30] message I believe it will be a wonderful
[1:28:33] thing amen I believe it will surely be a
[1:28:37] wonderful so previously before we
[1:28:39] started translating in
[1:28:43] and we previously started translating in
[1:28:47] luganda and I remember there there some
[1:28:49] years
[1:28:51] ago uh when I had gone to minister spe
[1:28:56] Tabernacle there's a brother that came
[1:28:58] to
[1:28:59] me and told me brother I've heard you do
[1:29:03] translations in Ethiopia I would we have
[1:29:07] a burden of translating this
[1:29:09] Mage he told me I have been translating
[1:29:11] it
[1:29:13] before but I feel that we need to
[1:29:16] resume but we do not have
[1:29:18] support and you have brothers who can
[1:29:21] help us
[1:29:23] trans told him I don't I can't
[1:29:26] promise but later on I went on to
[1:29:29] discuss the matter with our brother
[1:29:33] Tim and he agreed and we constituted a
[1:29:36] team of five translators I believe it
[1:29:42] was that's the first time I think I also
[1:29:45] met with
[1:29:47] Brother who happened to be one of those
[1:29:50] on that
[1:29:51] team and another one and this actually
[1:29:54] brother who spoke to me at the church
[1:29:58] there his name is
[1:30:01] brother he was the brother he the
[1:30:04] brother who has just passed
[1:30:06] away the father to Sister
[1:30:10] es and so he really did a great work in
[1:30:14] Translation right until his last
[1:30:18] time so um we we have lost a soldier
[1:30:24] a man who had a burden for this
[1:30:27] message and today after the
[1:30:31] service at 4
[1:30:34] p.m. Brother Martin um are there any
[1:30:38] changes yeah 4 p.m. is the barrier
[1:30:41] time so um I'm told we need to go
[1:30:44] earlier yeah are there are there
[1:30:46] arrangements for
[1:30:48] transportation but we shall make them
[1:30:50] immediately after service after the
[1:30:51] service okay the announcements will be
[1:30:53] made after the service amen so um for
[1:30:56] for those who want to go for the
[1:31:00] barri to not only support our sister
[1:31:03] Esther also stand behind a soldier
[1:31:06] someone who really stood for this
[1:31:11] message
[1:31:14] amen you know the last time I saw
[1:31:17] brother
[1:31:19] mu visited his
[1:31:21] house myself and brother martin
[1:31:25] and he was in
[1:31:26] pain a lot of
[1:31:29] pain you know this is someone who had
[1:31:31] different you know ailments in the
[1:31:34] body and um lot of complicated things in
[1:31:39] his
[1:31:40] body uh but um the pain was too
[1:31:43] much um and so that's the but I got that
[1:31:48] moment I told him
[1:31:50] brother God
[1:31:52] is one thing I know
[1:31:55] it is God's will for you not to have
[1:31:59] pain I told him that I said whether he's
[1:32:03] going to take you or you're going to
[1:32:05] stay in
[1:32:06] this you must not suffer you must not
[1:32:10] have pain and I'm going to pray with you
[1:32:13] that God will take away the
[1:32:15] pain and I want to say stand before all
[1:32:18] of you sister eser kept on updating us
[1:32:24] from that time to the time of his
[1:32:26] passing he did not have
[1:32:30] pain actually there's a doctor who
[1:32:33] visited and when he checked he
[1:32:36] said how come he's not in
[1:32:39] pain God took away the
[1:32:42] pain amen and I believe that you know it
[1:32:46] doesn't matter how we live this
[1:32:49] world it might be sickness unto
[1:32:52] death it might an accident like brother
[1:32:55] bam went in an

[1:33:08] how we get out of
[1:33:09] this there is another life
[1:33:12] after and that's the hope of every

[1:41:28] told you last
[1:41:31] Sunday he was moved over to

[1:41:39] reported to duty
[1:41:42] there but we didn't have time to have a
[1:41:44] chat because we were really very
[1:41:47] busy but at least we had time to have
[1:41:50] supper together in one of the days with
[1:41:53] him
[1:41:55] and also to connect him with the
[1:41:57] Believers that
[1:42:00] side it was it was a very good
[1:42:03] thing God bless you those who were
[1:42:07] contributing to the land
[1:42:09] fund um I I I made a few remarks I think
[1:42:13] last
[1:42:15] Sunday about those
[1:42:17] online and I said don't just enjoy the

[1:42:27] online giving
[1:42:32] platform uh brother Isaac you can
[1:42:35] actually put that for the people
[1:42:39] onl we have video and links for
[1:42:47] people so there's somebody who gave more
[1:42:50] than 2.9 Million sh this
[1:42:56] we um I personally do not know the
[1:43:01] person I have never met them I don't
[1:43:04] know them they've
[1:43:06] not but they gave so maybe they've been
[1:43:10] following the services
[1:43:13] silently and they gave

[1:43:43] almost two but the problem is the
[1:43:44] charges on that
[1:43:49] plat but what I can say

[1:45:16] accomplished praise the name of the Lord
[1:45:19] and so um this morning I'm going to
[1:45:21] speak to you on a subject that I feel is
[1:45:26] special and I believe that it will be a
[1:45:29] blessing to uh to all of you this
[1:45:33] morning because of the funeral service
[1:45:35] in the afternoon I'm not going to be
[1:45:37] very
[1:45:39] long so it's almost
[1:45:43] 12 so I see I may not even speak for an
[1:45:46] hour and a
[1:45:47] half so just pray with me pray for
[1:45:51] me listen to the word prayerfully this
[1:45:55] morning amen you've had a long
[1:45:58] week but can we now
[1:46:01] concentrate and listen to what the Holy
[1:46:03] Spirit has for
[1:46:05] us I'm going to speak to you on the
[1:46:07] appointed
[1:46:10] time of your
[1:46:16] visitation tell your
[1:46:20] neighbor tell your neighbor the appoint
[1:46:23] time of your
[1:46:30] Vis praise the name of the Lord
[1:46:34] hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:46:37] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:46:39] hallelujah our god is not a
[1:46:44] theologian our God is a
[1:46:47] Believer a believer of his own
[1:46:50] word when he gives his word
[1:46:53] he can't go back against
[1:46:56] you I am the word of God made
[1:47:00] manifest I was
[1:47:02] appointed to live in this house so that
[1:47:06] I can
[1:47:07] overcome because he said in in every
[1:47:10] age there are
[1:47:12] Overcomers if you read the book of
[1:47:14] Revelation you will find it says to they
[1:47:17] that will
[1:47:18] overcome they will sit with me on my
[1:47:21] Throne this is
[1:47:23] generation so I am
[1:47:26] appointed in this generation to overcome
[1:47:30] so I am here not to be defeated but I am
[1:47:34] here to defeat every Power of
[1:47:37] darkness and every Spirit of this world
[1:47:40] every pride of life every lust of the
[1:47:44] eyes every lust of the flesh I am here
[1:47:48] to
[1:47:50] overcome now overcoming
[1:47:53] means I'm going to fight with
[1:47:55] it overcoming means I'm going to go
[1:47:58] through it but overcoming means I am
[1:48:04] predestinated I am
[1:48:06] appointed to live in this
[1:48:09] generation not to be
[1:48:11] overcome but to
[1:48:13] overcome there are those who were
[1:48:16] made for the purpose of being
[1:48:21] overcome like pharaoh for example
[1:48:24] Pharaoh was not meant to
[1:48:26] overcome Pharaoh was meant to be
[1:48:30] overcome even God hardened his
[1:48:34] heart so that he can be overcome very
[1:48:38] well you know sometimes that God hardens
[1:48:41] you know the hearts of
[1:48:44] people that were
[1:48:46] meant be your enemies so that you can
[1:48:50] then prepare a table
[1:48:52] for you in the midst of
[1:48:55] them otherwise if you did not have
[1:48:58] enemies how can the power of God be
[1:49:03] seen God allowed someone to be with
[1:49:06] you so that after you have overcome
[1:49:09] their
[1:49:10] witch your God can be
[1:49:13] seen many times when someone bees
[1:49:17] someone they and and their witchcraft
[1:49:19] doesn't work it was meant to kill you
[1:49:23] and then doesn't kill you then they will
[1:49:26] come to you and they will say you are a
[1:49:29] witch because they think every other
[1:49:33] power is the power of Witchcraft they
[1:49:36] don't know we have another
[1:49:38] power back at home we used to have a
[1:49:43] neighbor and this neighbor was a
[1:49:47] witch well it is not very rare to have a
[1:49:50] neighbor who is a witch
[1:49:56] how many have ever had a neighbor who
[1:50:02] a some of you have lived in London you
[1:50:04] have no
[1:50:08] wit but we had a neighbor who was a
[1:50:11] we but in our home we were very
[1:50:14] prayerful and we never feared witches
[1:50:18] Believers don't fear
[1:50:19] witches no no no we don't fear witches
[1:50:22] so would be and be and
[1:50:25] be and also she was a night
[1:50:28] dancer so at night she would
[1:50:31] dance and come and dance around the door
[1:50:33] of our
[1:50:35] house so you would hear that she's now
[1:50:39] outside you know she's beeing beeing
[1:50:43] beeing but you know the more she would
[1:50:46] be the more powerful we would
[1:50:49] become our mother told us to pray our
[1:50:53] father told us to believe the word so we
[1:50:56] remained firm and so she began to call
[1:50:59] us
[1:51:00] witches but she did not realize we had
[1:51:03] another God who was more powerful than
[1:51:05] her
[1:51:07] witchcraft praise the name of the Lord
[1:51:10] so if you are
[1:51:17] appoint
[1:51:20] age also he or she has a
[1:51:26] visitation that has been appointed to
[1:51:30] happen at an appointed
[1:51:35] time sometimes you can pray for
[1:51:38] things and even fast and those things
[1:51:42] don't get to
[1:51:43] happen and then you wonder what is wrong
[1:51:46] with
[1:51:46] me some of you even begin blaming
[1:51:50] God but let me tell you brother sister
[1:51:53] there is always an appointed
[1:51:57] time for
[1:51:59] everything every blessing of God is
[1:52:02] word I believe is mine every promise is
[1:52:07] mine and I believe for it I pray for it
[1:52:11] if I don't see it now I believe I will
[1:52:14] have it unapp

[2:01:56] Lord God is appointed
[2:01:59] time for your
[2:02:02] visitation I feel like amen this time is
[2:02:07] someone who
[2:02:09] time for their
[2:02:11] visitation otherwise God will not give
[2:02:14] me this message
[2:02:18] today amen why is he anointing me to
[2:02:21] speak today
[2:02:23] God is visiting
[2:02:25] somebody but you must have a
[2:02:28] revelation listen when God visits you
[2:02:32] and you refuse him and you refuse his
[2:02:35] time and you refuse his
[2:02:38] Vis let me tell you what will happen
[2:02:41] will be
[2:02:45] back we see there was Jesus as he was
[2:02:50] walking and then he found a tree was it
[2:02:53] a manga tree
[2:02:54] or and when he found it it was not
[2:02:58] having
[2:03:00] fruits let me ask you was it the
[2:03:04] season for the tree to have
[2:03:07] fruits Bible readers tell
[2:03:14] me the tree was big
[2:03:16] enough but was it it season
[2:03:23] yes or no yes or no yes or no yes or no
[2:03:25] all right the Bible says it was not the
[2:03:32] season for the tree to bring forth
[2:03:38] Freedom it was not
[2:03:41] what the Tre
[2:03:45] season amen I'm burning up with re it
[2:03:49] was not the Tre season
[2:03:53] but it was the season of the maker
[2:03:59] of so when he came he desired
[2:04:04] for and the tree was like it's not my
[2:04:08] season and he said no it is your I
[2:04:11] want what are you talking about telling
[2:04:14] me you could judge the
[2:04:16] tree he could judge the tree and yet it
[2:04:19] wasn't the tree
[2:04:22] yeah because he is the maker of the
[2:04:25] tree it is not the tree
[2:04:28] season it is his
[2:04:32] season the season of the make of the
[2:04:38] tree are you hearing
[2:04:40] me and he told it because you have no
[2:04:45] fruit from today from today because you
[2:04:50] have rejected me
[2:04:53] no man will ever eat of you
[2:04:57] again my God and the
[2:05:01] disciples thought he was
[2:05:03] joking and when they passed by that side
[2:05:06] again they found the tree was
[2:05:11] dry brother sister if you want to
[2:05:15] dry spiritually if you want to dve
[2:05:19] physically when God visits you
[2:05:22] reject
[2:05:24] it then you will dve you will no longer
[2:05:28] have
[2:05:29] progress you will pray and fast but you
[2:05:33] are dry nothing can come out of you but
[2:05:37] the Bible says blessed is the man that
[2:05:41] WTH not in the councel of the
[2:05:44] ungod nor standeth in the way of
[2:05:47] sinners sth in the seat of the

[2:06:04] night you don't meditate in what they
[2:06:07] say you don't meditate in what your

[2:06:49] correctly listen he did not say it
[2:06:53] bringeth forth its fruit in its
[2:06:58] season but he said oh my God oh my God

[2:09:03] higher I want to show you an example
[2:09:06] here of a vision that God
[2:09:10] WR before its appointed
[2:09:13] time from there I will show you when the
[2:09:16] appointed time had
[2:09:19] come my God people who are ready
[2:09:22] today to be ho
[2:09:25] rers there is no better
[2:09:29] service prepare your mind because this I
[2:09:31] tell you is
[2:09:33] finishing Isaiah 7:
[2:09:36] 10 verse to verse
[2:09:42] 14 moreover the Lord spake again unto a
[2:09:46] saying of course speaking by the mouth
[2:09:49] of Isaiah ask thee a sign of the Lord
[2:09:53] thy God ask it either in the depth or in
[2:09:56] the height above but I has said I will
[2:09:59] not ask neither will I tempt the Lord
[2:10:22] uhhuh now here ah refused to ask for a
[2:10:27] sign okay verse 13 and he said please
[2:10:33] listen to me he ye
[2:10:36] now oh House of David is it a small
[2:10:40] thing for you to warry man but will you
[2:10:43] warry my God also there the Lord himself
[2:10:47] shall give you a
[2:10:48] sign you can read up to there
[2:11:07] tell your neighbor the Lord himself
[2:11:09] shall give you a
[2:11:11] sign oh my if they're not hearing tap
[2:11:14] them again tell them the Lord himself
[2:11:15] shall give you a
[2:11:18] sign now listen what is the sign
[2:11:22] Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[2:11:25] a son and shall and and shall call his
[2:11:28] name
[2:11:39] emmanu what was this a sign what was
[2:11:44] this a sign who gave the
[2:11:48] sign God himself hey
[2:11:52] when God gives a
[2:11:54] sign he says it is a vision
[2:11:57] now write it down how many of you has
[2:12:00] God given a sign about their
[2:12:03] life how many have
[2:12:05] visions that you know must happen in
[2:12:07] your
[2:12:10] life hallelujah hallelujah when go when
[2:12:13] God shows
[2:12:14] you signs and
[2:12:17] vision when it shows you signs it
[2:12:20] becomes a vision
[2:12:23] I don't know how to explain
[2:12:25] it it becomes a
[2:12:28] vision and then you have to write it
[2:12:32] down many times when prophetic utterance
[2:12:37] comes it used in Ethiopia what we
[2:12:40] Believers used to do is to take it and
[2:12:43] write it
[2:12:45] down when sometimes even God here speaks
[2:12:49] through maybe a tongue or through
[2:12:50] prophet
[2:12:52] interpretation of don't just here and
[2:12:54] leave it
[2:12:55] there let us have spiritual women and
[2:12:58] men who will pick up their pen and write
[2:13:02] those those Visions Because by the time
[2:13:06] it is
[2:13:07] uttered as as out of the mouth of God it
[2:13:11] becomes a
[2:13:12] vision which is going to happen but it
[2:13:16] has not yet but it will happen so you
[2:13:19] have to write it down
[2:13:21] he said in the word that for the vision
[2:13:25] is yet for una appointed
[2:13:30] time but at the end it shall
[2:13:33] speak and not lie so when you write it
[2:13:37] down you believe it shall happen God is
[2:13:41] appointed
[2:13:43] time it may be something you want in the
[2:13:46] normal
[2:13:47] life maybe you want to buy a house don't
[2:13:50] fear
[2:13:51] if God has revealed it to you your faith
[2:13:56] has given it to you you have it already
[2:13:59] somebody else doesn't believe for it
[2:14:02] somebody else doesn't even believe they
[2:14:04] can buy land of their
[2:14:06] own but when God reveals it to you
[2:14:08] brother pick up a pen and paper write
[2:14:12] down the
[2:14:13] vision I will build a
[2:14:16] house I will do marage some people don't
[2:14:19] even feel like marriage
[2:14:22] but if God reveals it to you you are
[2:14:25] going to get married you're going to be
[2:14:26] a mother you're going to be a father

[2:14:36] the fear of the Lord I will I will I
[2:14:39] will what is it it is a
[2:14:43] vision it is a vision that God has made
[2:14:46] known to
[2:14:48] you amen and when you write it down your
[2:14:51] work then is to
[2:14:53] wait wait for God his appointed
[2:14:57] time so he
[2:14:59] told if you won't ask for a
[2:15:02] sign I will give you a sign the Lord
[2:15:06] himself shall give you a no man can give
[2:15:10] you a vision only God if your faith
[2:15:15] believes for
[2:15:16] it then it is

[2:15:24] be a rich woman a rich
[2:15:26] man it is
[2:15:28] yours there are some there is someone
[2:15:30] who will never believe
[2:15:32] it if your faith believes you going to
[2:15:37] excel in
[2:15:39] school it is yours if your faith
[2:15:42] believes I am getting married this
[2:15:46] year when it comes as an
[2:15:49] inspiration it is a sign
[2:15:51] it is a
[2:15:52] vision write it down write it down write
[2:15:57] it down write it
[2:15:59] down I was 19 years
[2:16:02] old and I was in
[2:16:04] university and as I went to zimb to
[2:16:08] Minister preach the gospel as a young
[2:16:11] boy who is in school when I was there
[2:16:16] serving God it came to me as a
[2:16:19] sign that I will be a
[2:16:22] preacher that I will travel the world
[2:16:25] for the purpose of this message it came
[2:16:28] to me as a vision I saw my future
[2:16:33] literally I saw today literally before
[2:16:36] it
[2:16:38] happened and I was so you know full with
[2:16:42] this Vision I wrote it down I began
[2:16:46] realigning my life I came back to my
[2:16:48] mother I told her mom
[2:16:51] I'm quitting
[2:16:53] school why because I'm getting married
[2:16:57] why are you getting married I said
[2:16:58] because God has revealed to me I'm going
[2:17:01] into Ministry and if it is true I need
[2:17:04] to realign my life I need to prepare
[2:17:08] myself for the vision which God
[2:17:11] has no one believed me at the time but
[2:17:15] it was a vision it was a sign that come
[2:17:19] from the supernatural
[2:17:24] now that's only my
[2:17:25] testimony but I'm showing you here
[2:17:27] another testimony in the
[2:17:28] word Behold a virgin shall
[2:17:33] conceive that was a sign therefore it
[2:17:36] was a
[2:17:37] vision and it was written
[2:17:39] down by prophet Isaiah
[2:17:43] Hallelujah when Isaiah saw it Isaiah

[2:18:50] had never seen
[2:18:52] before this man had seen a
[2:18:56] vision this man had been given a Sign by
[2:18:59] God and he began writing it
[2:19:02] down to us a child is
[2:19:04] born us a son is

[2:19:17] wonderful coun Mighty God the ever
[2:19:21] father the prince of peace and then
[2:19:24] listen he begins to talk about this
[2:19:27] man's
[2:19:29] government he
[2:19:31] says the increase of his
[2:19:34] government and peace there shall be no
[2:19:39] end in the first
[2:19:41] Vision he he said these
[2:19:44] words the government shall be
[2:19:48] upon his shoulder
[2:19:51] are you following me
[2:19:53] church he spoke his word by a
[2:19:57] prophet it looked like
[2:19:59] impossible when he said a Virg shall
[2:20:02] conceive the vision was
[2:20:05] appointed for a specific
[2:20:08] time and
[2:20:10] kept written down now there were many
[2:20:15] interpretations when you read through
[2:20:17] these
[2:20:18] Visions there are many interpretations
[2:20:21] I believe that men
[2:20:23] had but the scripture said the Zeal of
[2:20:26] the Lord of
[2:20:29] host read it read it continue There the
[2:20:32] Zeal of the Lord of host will perform
[2:20:38] [Music]
[2:20:43] this oh my God Hallelujah the Zeal of
[2:20:47] the Lord of hosts
[2:20:56] theal the
[2:21:00] of not just the Lord but the Lord of
[2:21:05] H the Zeal of the Lord
[2:21:09] of will accomplish the
[2:21:12] vision when God gives you any
[2:21:17] Vision do not disbelieve it
[2:21:22] write it down amen and for thus sayith
[2:21:25] the
[2:21:26] Lord the Seal of the Lord of
[2:21:29] H
[2:21:33] will that is how God
[2:21:36] works the Zeal of the Lord of
[2:21:39] host was going to perform
[2:21:42] this it was going to
[2:21:44] happen there many men who would have
[2:21:47] come and a virgin shall conceive
[2:21:51] maybe he means a girl who was a
[2:21:57] virgin and then she'll get a man and
[2:22:00] conceived by
[2:22:02] him and maybe they interpreted it said
[2:22:06] brother
[2:22:07] read he's not saying a woman who is a
[2:22:12] virgin he's saying a woman who is a
[2:22:16] virgin will lose our
[2:22:18] virginity and conceive
[2:22:21] you can interpret it that way maybe they
[2:22:23] interpreted it that
[2:22:25] way she'll get a man and conceive but
[2:22:30] God had said it and the prophet had
[2:22:34] written it down on a paper it was now a
[2:22:38] vision not subject to
[2:22:42] editing not subject to explaining not
[2:22:46] subject to doubting but subject to
[2:22:50] happening
[2:22:51] the only thing that they were now
[2:22:53] waiting for is to see the vision
[2:22:57] happening let us see how will God bring
[2:22:59] it to
[2:23:00] pass he will bring it to pass with the
[2:23:04] Zeal of the
[2:23:05] Lord the Lord of
[2:23:09] H now in the message proving his
[2:23:12] word people
[2:23:14] doubted people disbelieved it others
[2:23:17] preached it without understanding
[2:23:20] like a
[2:23:23] customary for people to read it the
[2:23:26] Virgin shall
[2:23:27] conceive and a child a
[2:23:32] virin maybe many Rose
[2:23:34] up oh someone came up and they began
[2:23:37] making comedy out of
[2:23:39] it
[2:23:41] said are you a
[2:23:43] virgin
[2:23:45] yes then go in a room then come out to
[2:23:48] the baby ah
[2:23:53] a
[2:23:54] virin and a baby
[2:23:56] is and they began ridiculing the
[2:23:59] prophecy they began
[2:24:01] ridiculing the vision but that did not
[2:24:05] stop
[2:24:06] God from accomplishing the
[2:24:09] vision listen when God says
[2:24:12] something he does not need a man's

[2:28:22] said master and will always
[2:28:26] happen praise the name of the Lord now I
[2:28:29] want to read for you for you from the
[2:28:31] Philadelphian Church
[2:28:34] age in it says here now it says in
[2:28:38] Isaiah 22:22
[2:28:42] 1222 oh excuse me
[2:28:45] 2222 it says and the key of the House of
[2:28:49] David
[2:28:52] will I lay upon his shoulder put the
[2:28:55] SC will I lay upon his
[2:28:58] shoulder amen can you put up the
[2:29:00] scripture right okay you put up the
[2:29:01] message it's in the Bible you can check
[2:29:03] it out okay and the key of the House of
[2:29:05] David I lay upon his
[2:29:07] shoulder so he shall
[2:29:10] open please listen be
[2:29:13] attentive and None Shall
[2:29:17] shut and he shall shut
[2:29:21] and None
[2:29:22] Shall
[2:29:25] open what does it the
[2:29:28] Key of
[2:29:31] David now the spirit of the spirit uses
[2:29:33] this Old Testament
[2:29:37] reference listen to these things
[2:29:39] friends it's going to mature you it's
[2:29:43] going to establish you they don't go out
[2:29:46] stay inside and
[2:29:48] listen it's just a small qut but it's
[2:29:51] going to
[2:29:53] establish it is power
[2:29:55] pack it has a powerful
[2:29:58] anointing listen as I was reading it I
[2:30:00] felt it the spirit uses this Old
[2:30:03] Testament reference concerning the Lord
[2:30:04] Jesus
[2:30:07] Christ and his ministry in the church
[2:30:10] what the Key of David signified at that
[2:30:12] time is m is mere shadow
[2:30:20] which is now fulfilled in Jesus standing
[2:30:22] in the midst of the lamp
[2:30:26] stand it has to do with our Lord after
[2:30:30] his
[2:30:33] resurrection and not his
[2:30:38] Earth fine thank you but what does this
[2:30:41] key
[2:30:43] signify ask your neighbor what does this
[2:30:47] key what is the Key of David
[2:30:51] the answer lies in the position of the
[2:30:54] key where the key
[2:30:58] is it is not on his
[2:31:01] hand it is not wor around his
[2:31:04] neck it's not placed in the hands of
[2:31:06] other
[2:31:08] men or the verse could not be saying
[2:31:11] that he he alone has the use of that key
[2:31:21] for he alone
[2:31:23] opens and he alone
[2:31:25] shuts and no man has the right but Jesus
[2:31:30] himself isn't that right but the
[2:31:34] question is where is the
[2:31:37] key it is on his
[2:31:40] shoulder now while I'm reading this I
[2:31:43] want you to remember where we
[2:31:45] read in Isaiah amen he say the
[2:31:49] government
[2:31:51] shall be upon his
[2:31:54] shoulder but what does this mean the
[2:31:58] answer is this the phrase government
[2:32:01] upon his
[2:32:03] shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony
[2:32:05] of the
[2:32:07] [Music]
[2:32:08] East when the bride has been committed
[2:32:11] to the
[2:32:13] groom she would take a
[2:32:18] veil which was is on her
[2:32:22] head and she would place it over the
[2:32:24] groom's
[2:32:28] shoulder
[2:32:30] signifying that not only is she under
[2:32:33] his
[2:32:36] Dominion but that she has transferred
[2:32:39] his rights her rights to
[2:32:47] him are you listening to me he the
[2:32:51] man is the
[2:32:53] head but also that
[2:32:56] he be the
[2:32:59] responsibility and the
[2:33:02] care are you hearing me he bear the
[2:33:05] responsibility care and that he and he
[2:33:13] alone no one else no other man no other
[2:33:18] power has any
[2:33:20] right and responsibility over this
[2:33:26] woman actually that's even what marriage
[2:33:30] means and that that beloved is the Key
[2:33:33] of
[2:33:36] David listen please listen God being
[2:33:41] Sovereign he for
[2:33:43] you by Divine
[2:33:47] decree exactly who would be in his
[2:33:54] Bri am he

[2:34:01] her he chose her she did not choose
[2:34:07] him Hallelujah

[2:34:27] her for
[2:34:30] her on her own for her she belongs to
[2:34:34] him and to him
[2:34:38] alone she is Holy
[2:34:41] committed to
[2:34:45] him listen to these next words and he
[2:34:51] accepts the
[2:34:55] obligation he is her
[2:35:00] head for Christ is the head of the
[2:35:04] church are you
[2:35:06] hearing some of you are not understand
[2:35:08] what I'm
[2:35:09] saying now this is going to be
[2:35:12] connected to the government being
[2:35:17] Aon Hallelujah Hallelujah and the
[2:35:20] prophet is telling us in the East when
[2:35:24] they would get married you know the
[2:35:27] woman would put a
[2:35:29] veil and put on the shoulders
[2:35:31] of to

[2:35:36] responsibility over
[2:35:39] her but him and him
[2:35:41] alone no one else no other power nothing
[2:35:45] else in the same way spiritually

[2:35:57] their lives to

[2:36:04] before you even

[2:36:08] but

[2:50:04] conceive and bear a
[2:50:07] son now let us
[2:50:09] see when the appointed time
[2:50:12] came Luke 1 ver
[2:50:16] 26 and in the sixth month
[2:50:19] the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto
[2:50:23] a city of Galilee named
[2:50:31] Nazareth did someone hear that come on
[2:50:35] Church you hear
[2:50:37] that you're so quiet on me at this
[2:50:42] moment when you when you hear people are
[2:50:44] quiet or becoming quiet it means the
[2:50:47] sisters are quiet s are
[2:50:50] you can we say
[2:50:53] Amen all right now I know you are
[2:50:56] there in the sixth month the angel
[2:51:01] Gabriel was sent from
[2:51:04] God under the city Nam
[2:51:07] Nazareth now we see here the angel of
[2:51:09] the Lord was
[2:51:11] what sent by
[2:51:15] who do you see any Scripture
[2:51:19] that Mary was waiting for
[2:51:23] the sister phib was Mar praying for this
[2:51:27] Angel to
[2:51:32] come what was she
[2:51:34] doing she was just going about her
[2:51:40] business and what was she she was a
[2:51:44] virgin someone should clap for that
[2:51:49] why a virgin shall
[2:51:53] conceive to a virgin espoused to a man
[2:51:57] whose name was Joseph of the House of
[2:51:58] David and the virgin's name was
[2:52:10] Mary talk about God coming to someone
[2:52:14] who is already potentially someone
[2:52:16] else's wife
[2:52:19] [Music]
[2:52:22] but she was a
[2:52:23] virgin there is a reason why God came to
[2:52:27] her there is a reason why
[2:52:29] Mary and not somebody else because oh my
[2:52:34] God had already predated
[2:52:37] this there was a
[2:52:39] connection there was a
[2:52:41] connection oh my God if you can t with
[2:52:45] me now for 20 more minutes
[2:52:49] I'll show you this thing how many want
[2:52:51] to see it all right let's go he says and
[2:52:55] Mary the virgin's name was
[2:52:58] Mary and the angel came unto her and
[2:53:01] said hail thou that highly
[2:53:07] favored the Lord is with thee blessed
[2:53:11] are thou among
[2:53:12] women and when she saw him she was
[2:53:14] troubled at his
[2:53:17] saying and C her mind what manner of
[2:53:19] citation this should
[2:53:22] be and the angel of the Lord and the
[2:53:24] angel said unto her fear not
[2:53:27] Mary oh my God those sweet
[2:53:32] words oh my
[2:53:34] God praise God until today my wife
[2:53:40] remembers the words that changed her
[2:53:43] life I forget but she always
[2:53:46] reminds you know when you came to me
[2:53:48] that day and he spoke those words it
[2:53:52] turned my life my heart
[2:53:57] changed words of a
[2:54:00] man are meant to naturally move a
[2:54:06] woman are you hearing
[2:54:09] me how much more the word of
[2:54:14] God notice the way the angel came was so
[2:54:17] so lovely
[2:54:20] Fe not
[2:54:23] married he didn't come to the way to her
[2:54:25] the way he came to
[2:54:28] others fear not I'm set from the Pres of
[2:54:33] God fear not
[2:54:36] Mary for
[2:54:38] thou Hast found favor with
[2:54:42] God was
[2:54:45] like those words change me
[2:54:50] and behold thou sh conceive in thy
[2:54:55] wom and bring forth a son and shall call
[2:54:59] his name Jesus he shall be great and
[2:55:02] shall be called the son of the
[2:55:04] highest and the Lord God shall give unto
[2:55:07] him the Throne of his
[2:55:09] father now you see where the K of of
[2:55:11] David
[2:55:13] comes we talk about the KY of David
[2:55:16] later and Reign Over The House of Jacob
[2:55:21] forever open no man shall oh my God and
[2:55:23] of his kingdom there shall be no
[2:55:26] end is this not the same prophets in the
[2:55:28] Old Testament which was in the vision of
[2:55:33] Isaiah oh my God then said Mary unto the
[2:55:38] angel how shall this
[2:55:41] be saying I know not a
[2:55:43] man and the angels answered and said
[2:55:46] unto
[2:55:46] her the ghost shall come upon
[2:55:50] thee and the power of the highest shall
[2:55:52] overshadow
[2:55:54] thee there also that ho
[2:55:57] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[2:56:01] be called a Son of
[2:56:04] God and behold thy
[2:56:07] cousin now I know why now I know why
[2:56:12] there is a reason why God came to
[2:56:15] Mary there was a connection
[2:56:19] amen oh my do you see it there was a
[2:56:23] connection Amen in the family of Mary
[2:56:26] amen God had a predestinated
[2:56:32] man in the family of Mary God had known
[2:56:36] Mary and God had known
[2:56:39] Elizabeth they were
[2:56:41] cousins and they were
[2:56:44] meant to live in a
[2:56:46] time when God's appointed
[2:56:50] Vision will
[2:56:53] happen it had to be
[2:56:57] married it had to be the
[2:56:59] time it could not be another
[2:57:02] time that was the
[2:57:05] time Mary either receives
[2:57:08] it or rejects it I don't
[2:57:12] believe that Elizabeth only had Mary as
[2:57:14] a
[2:57:16] cousin I believe Elizabeth had other
[2:57:21] cousins if Mary
[2:57:24] refused the angel would go to another
[2:57:27] cousin of
[2:57:29] Elizabeth even on the side of
[2:57:31] Elizabeth God was moving things and the
[2:57:35] things were
[2:57:36] planning to happen
[2:57:39] exactly at that
[2:57:41] moment the way God did
[2:57:44] his was that at this time on that
[2:57:49] at that houry was supposed to be
[2:57:53] pregnant that moment do you get it
[2:57:58] now the time had come for the vision
[2:58:03] that God showed Isaiah to be
[2:58:07] fulfilled there is much more than what
[2:58:09] I'm saying
[2:58:11] here as I'm preaching some of you look
[2:58:15] at your
[2:58:16] life I'm not just telling you
[2:58:19] history but these words are by
[2:58:22] inspiration God is speaking into your
[2:58:25] life see yourself when I'm talking about
[2:58:28] Mary don't see Mary see
[2:58:32] yourself hallelu and behold th cousin
[2:58:35] Mary
[2:58:37] Elizabeth she also has
[2:58:45] conceived the angel of God was
[2:58:56] which was going to bring
[2:58:57] results she has also
[2:59:00] conceived
[2:59:02] son in her old
[2:59:05] age and this is the six month with
[2:59:08] her why do you think the angel was
[2:59:10] telling Mary about
[2:59:14] this do you think Angels gossip
[2:59:18] there was a
[2:59:20] reason the angel was sent to bring this
[2:59:23] message he wasn't speaking his idea he
[2:59:27] was speaking the perfect will of
[2:59:33] God and Mary said and the angel said for
[2:59:36] with God nothing shall be
[2:59:40] impossible and Mary said behold the
[2:59:44] handmade of the Lord be it unto me
[2:59:49] according to Thy
[2:59:51] word the moment she said
[2:59:54] that it was
[2:59:58] done she's pregnant and the angel
[3:00:01] departed from her and Mary arose in
[3:00:05] those
[3:00:06] days and went into the
[3:00:08] hill with
[3:00:10] h into the city of
[3:00:12] Judah
[3:00:15] friends Jesus Christ something I want
[3:00:17] you to see
[3:00:19] I'm busting with this
[3:00:21] Revelation and I'm saying our time is
[3:00:24] fast but if you can give me more more
[3:00:26] moments now of your time and
[3:00:29] attention remember there was a
[3:00:32] promise for an
[3:00:35] Min in Malachi
[3:00:38] 3 that Elijah will come and shall
[3:00:42] prepare the way of the
[3:00:45] Lord who would be that man
[3:00:48] John
[3:00:51] the and
[3:00:53] Elizabeth was supposed to give birth
[3:00:59] John so that John the
[3:01:05] Baptist can lead the way of the
[3:01:10] Lord the vision had been
[3:01:15] given but here is something I want you
[3:01:18] to
[3:01:19] see God
[3:01:23] made God made
[3:01:29] Elizabeth for a long
[3:01:34] time until
[3:01:42] anointed some of you may take too
[3:01:46] long to find your lifetime
[3:01:52] partner don't be
[3:01:55] anxious be anxious for
[3:01:58] nothing there is an
[3:02:03] appointed and this goes to Sisters
[3:02:07] especially because you you have to
[3:02:10] wait marry her to wa Elizabeth
[3:02:15] to but the man makes the choice
[3:02:19] the man prays sees the vision of and
[3:02:22] moves into action but the woman has to
[3:02:27] waigh so Elizabeth was
[3:02:30] waiting maybe she pray that go
[3:02:33] TI and stopped even
[3:02:36] praying Elizabeth was no having no no
[3:02:40] child and everybody was calling a
[3:02:43] bar but it was the will of God because
[3:02:47] God appointed
[3:02:49] time had not come
[3:02:52] yet when the time had
[3:02:56] come nothing would
[3:02:58] stop Elizabeth from having a
[3:03:02] baby nothing stopped
[3:03:04] Elizabeth from becoming pregnant when
[3:03:08] the time
[3:03:09] came even when Elizabeth got the
[3:03:14] baby and the baby died in the womb
[3:03:19] God God is God he still made that life
[3:03:25] come back
[3:03:28] again God is God as long as you're
[3:03:31] walking right with
[3:03:33] him you may lose a child and you even
[3:03:36] feel like you are desperate you even
[3:03:39] feel like God is not with you let me
[3:03:42] tell you brother God makes no
[3:03:45] mistakes when it comes to children
[3:03:48] God if your life is right with him only
[3:03:52] look at
[3:03:53] Calvary he makes no mistakes in
[3:03:56] everything he does he has an appointed
[3:04:01] time you may be sick and you want him to
[3:04:04] heal you right there and then but he may
[3:04:07] wait to heal
[3:04:08] you because he's
[3:04:10] waiting for that appointed
[3:04:13] time there is something that has to
[3:04:16] connect with something
[3:04:19] for something to come out
[3:04:22] of hallelujah amen Elizabeth had to be
[3:04:27] Buren because maybe Mary was still
[3:04:32] young Mary was the one
[3:04:34] appointed to have the Messiah
[3:04:37] in Hallelujah and Elizabeth was already
[3:04:42] old
[3:04:43] grown you see God made a
[3:04:49] you cannot give birth to
[3:04:53] John before the mesiah is
[3:04:56] here John will only be born for one
[3:05:00] purpose to prepare the way of the
[3:05:03] Mah and before the woman who is going to
[3:05:06] give birth to the Messiah is
[3:05:10] born and before she grows I will lock up
[3:05:14] your stomach because your stomach is
[3:05:16] Holy supposed to bring forth my
[3:05:19] Prophet who will do a job no other
[3:05:22] Prophet has ever
[3:05:24] done Zarah was there praying Elizabeth
[3:05:29] was there
[3:05:31] praying God did not answer that
[3:05:34] prayer until the appointed
[3:05:40] time when Mary grew maybe her parents
[3:05:43] moved
[3:05:44] quickly to make her get married to J
[3:05:48] and God when he saw
[3:05:50] that my time has come let me Rush before
[3:05:53] corrup
[3:05:56] her he sent the Angel and the
[3:05:59] angel I am sent from the presence
[3:06:03] of to tell you you will have a child in
[3:06:08] your
[3:06:09] wom and you'll call his name
[3:06:12] Jesus Will these things be don't worry
[3:06:15] there's nothing impossible with power of
[3:06:17] the Holy Ghost
[3:06:20] will
[3:06:23] will I can't understand it but be
[3:06:28] me to your
[3:06:30] word
[3:06:34] moment Joseph never touched
[3:06:39] her because God spoke to
[3:06:43] him
[3:06:45] Hallelujah are you following me
[3:06:48] oh my God
[3:06:50] hallelujah I'll give this
[3:06:53] testimony it's not mine
[3:06:55] but brother Tim has given it
[3:06:57] before the man who wed me and my
[3:07:01] wife his name is brother Tim he's from
[3:07:04] Canada he was a pastor of a church in
[3:07:08] another region in the
[3:07:10] north married with eight
[3:07:14] children his wife died just like that
[3:07:18] his children are all
[3:07:20] big one of them was even at my
[3:07:23] wedding now there was meanwhile a
[3:07:28] sister in the church another church
[3:07:32] church of brother Eddie
[3:07:34] bis that time she was the
[3:07:37] secretary her name is I don't need to
[3:07:40] mention name and so this
[3:07:43] sister was not
[3:07:45] married for many years
[3:07:50] but
[3:07:51] faithful and Faithfully serving
[3:07:55] God not living a
[3:07:58] life not living in
[3:08:01] immorality but living
[3:08:04] virtuous
[3:08:06] waiting for the
[3:08:11] appointed brother Tim told
[3:08:14] me while his wife was dying
[3:08:19] that same day this sister sah I
[3:08:22] mentioned her
[3:08:24] name in their
[3:08:27] Church she was actually singing a
[3:08:29] special
[3:08:31] song now I don't remember but the song
[3:08:35] was talking about him and our future
[3:08:40] husband and at that
[3:08:42] moment the other sister was dying
[3:08:49] later on but the team moved to this
[3:08:53] church by
[3:08:55] invitation to lead
[3:08:59] missions in the
[3:09:01] church and he left the other Church to
[3:09:05] be and in this church where
[3:09:07] he he ends up Maring this
[3:09:12] sister the sister was I think even over
[3:09:14] 40 I
[3:09:16] think
[3:09:21] mhm God disappointed
[3:09:26] time sister
[3:09:28] m a sister in Ethiopia she was living in
[3:09:32] Kenya Faithfully serving

[3:09:39] years in a very good

[3:10:33] believed
[3:10:36] yet her husband didn't even know there
[3:10:38] is a
[3:10:42] message so God had to make Mery weight
[3:10:46] [Music]
[3:10:48] give her everything she
[3:10:51] needed but said on this
[3:10:54] issue so she also waited and left all
[3:10:58] other
[3:10:59] boys and waited for the
[3:11:04] perfect and when this moment
[3:11:08] came brother morgus wanted to to be
[3:11:12] married and all the sisters in the
[3:11:14] church he didn't choose any
[3:11:17] maybe tried to talk to a
[3:11:19] few but it wasn't his
[3:11:22] vision turn them
[3:11:24] down came to me and said my wife is not
[3:11:28] here but my wife is
[3:11:30] somewhere serving
[3:11:32] God in a church of the message
[3:11:38] somewhere it was not told
[3:11:41] him it came to
[3:11:43] him as a revelation as a sign
[3:11:48] during a preaching like
[3:11:50] this and he wrote it
[3:11:52] down he continued
[3:11:55] confessing and in the first wedding in
[3:11:57] the
[3:11:58] church this sister shows
[3:12:01] up and the brother said one day I turn
[3:12:06] my
[3:12:06] eyes and I will see
[3:12:10] her it was a revelation it was a vision
[3:12:14] to him had not seen it happen but he
[3:12:17] believed for it and here is the sister
[3:12:19] in the
[3:12:20] church she's crying on Sunday morning
[3:12:23] after the wedding the previous
[3:12:26] day they TR from Kenya a big group and
[3:12:31] she was one of
[3:12:32] them she was crying crying and I was on
[3:12:35] the pull
[3:12:36] pit and we were all crying and when when
[3:12:40] we started talking to the people we
[3:12:42] raised our heads and we cleaning our
[3:12:45] eyes andus was on my right
[3:12:48] side he lifted up his eyes turned his
[3:12:52] head and saw her and at that
[3:12:57] moment it was revealed to
[3:12:59] him that was his
[3:13:01] wife he came to the office later told I
[3:13:05] said are you sure he said yes I'm sure I
[3:13:09] gave him a book to read I told him read
[3:13:11] this book when you are done and you feel
[3:13:16] the same feeling
[3:13:17] then I'll tell you what
[3:13:19] next and the the rest is
[3:13:21] history they now married and is the
[3:13:24] pastor of the
[3:13:26] church and and this
[3:13:29] sister when it came to her
[3:13:31] job she didn't even have to
[3:13:34] hustle the way God did it was
[3:13:38] Supernatural to be able to go and be
[3:13:40] with
[3:13:43] ourand appointed time of God
[3:13:47] but the question is can we
[3:13:51] wait for the appointed
[3:13:55] time of our
[3:13:58] visitation and when that moment comes
[3:14:02] are we willing to
[3:14:08] receive that's how God
[3:14:11] works and before I I I I I bring it to a
[3:14:14] close I want us to go into our Bible
[3:14:21] in the Book of
[3:14:22] Luke we are going to read many verses
[3:14:24] from
[3:14:25] there and read on the side of zacharius
[3:14:28] and side of the birth of
[3:14:32] John and then I'll bring this to a close
[3:14:35] friends this is just so
[3:14:37] shocking moving I think is the right
[3:14:41] word but I would say it's the word of
[3:14:45] God it is is
[3:14:48] real it is
[3:14:51] real it is
[3:14:54] real there was in in the days we are
[3:14:56] beginning from verse 5 chapter one of
[3:15:01] Luke if you could please stand there
[3:15:03] with me and we read
[3:15:07] together there was in the days of hero
[3:15:10] the King of Judea a certain priest named
[3:15:11] Zacharias of the course of ABIA and his
[3:15:14] wife was of the daughters of Aaron and
[3:15:16] her name was Elizabeth and they were
[3:15:18] both righteous before God walking in all
[3:15:21] the Commandments and and ordinances of
[3:15:23] the Lord blameless and they had no child
[3:15:26] because that Elizabeth was Barren and
[3:15:28] they both were now well stricken in
[3:15:30] years and it came to pass that while he
[3:15:33] executed the priest's office before God
[3:15:35] in the order of his cause according to
[3:15:37] the custom of the priest's office his
[3:15:39] lot was to burn incense when he went
[3:15:41] into the Temple of the Lord and the
[3:15:43] whole multitude of the people were
[3:15:45] praying without at the time of the
[3:15:47] incense and there appeared unto him an
[3:15:49] angel of the Lord standing on the right
[3:15:51] side of the altar of incense and when
[3:15:53] Zacharias saw him he was troubled and
[3:15:55] fear fell upon them upon him but the
[3:15:57] angel said unto him fear not Zacharias
[3:16:00] for thy prayer is heard and thy wife
[3:16:02] Elizabeth shall bear the a son and I
[3:16:04] shall call his name John now this is the
[3:16:06] Angel of the Lord speaking to to to
[3:16:11] Zacharias he said he said thou shall you
[3:16:15] will bear a son God has heard your
[3:16:16] prayer
[3:16:18] and your wife now will finally have a
[3:16:20] son and you shall call his name
[3:16:23] John and you shall have joy and gladness
[3:16:25] and many shall rejoice at his
[3:16:28] birth for he shall be great in the sight
[3:16:31] of the Lord and shall drink neither wine
[3:16:32] no strong drink and he shall be filled
[3:16:34] with the Holy Ghost even from his
[3:16:35] mother's womb you can follow me if
[3:16:37] you're reading luganda just follow and
[3:16:39] many of the children of Israel shall he
[3:16:41] turn to the Lord their God and he shall
[3:16:43] go before him in the spirit and power of
[3:16:45] Elias to turn the hearts of of the
[3:16:47] fathers to the children are you
[3:16:48] listening and a disobedient to the
[3:16:50] wisdom of the just to make ready a
[3:16:51] people prepared for the Lord and
[3:16:53] Zacharia said unto the
[3:16:56] angel now you can interpret
[3:16:59] it when the angel
[3:17:01] came I know you're quiet but I know you
[3:17:04] listen and that's okay when the angel
[3:17:09] came at that moment he
[3:17:13] had he had not come to joke
[3:17:17] he had not come to waste
[3:17:19] time he didn't even have time to
[3:17:22] was because the the God that was going
[3:17:25] to bring forth the Messiah had already
[3:17:27] now come to full
[3:17:31] maturity and and and and and this
[3:17:34] zakariah he had the
[3:17:37] seed which was going to bring forth the
[3:17:40] man who would prepare the messiah's
[3:17:44] coming and Zariah had waited
[3:17:47] together with his wife elizabe they
[3:17:50] didn't have a baby so when the angel now
[3:17:53] came to Zarah he was not about to waste
[3:17:57] any
[3:17:59] moment and when he talked to
[3:18:01] Zechariah and zear instead of
[3:18:04] believing what did he say he said how
[3:18:06] shall I know this I am an old man and my
[3:18:10] wife is very old the angel was not
[3:18:14] happy when you time for your visitation
[3:18:19] come don't turn it
[3:18:23] down it Grieves the angel of the
[3:18:26] Lord and the angel answering said unto
[3:18:30] him what I believe this is what the
[3:18:33] angel
[3:18:34] felt said I am
[3:18:37] Gabriel that stand in the presence of
[3:18:40] God and I am sent to speak unto the and
[3:18:44] to show you this glad Tiding
[3:18:47] and behold thou shall be
[3:18:51] dumb and and not be able to speak until
[3:18:55] the day these things shall be
[3:18:59] performed because thou believest not my
[3:19:02] words we shall be fulfilled in their
[3:19:07] season in their
[3:19:09] season in their season not in the season
[3:19:12] of
[3:19:15] Zarah Zariah said I'm
[3:19:18] old listen to me brothers and sisters it
[3:19:21] doesn't matter your
[3:19:23] situation when God is appointed time has
[3:19:26] come he will accomplish his
[3:19:29] words in his
[3:19:32] season not your season whether you feel
[3:19:35] like it or not he will fulfill it
[3:19:39] whether you accept it or not he
[3:19:42] will
[3:19:44] Hallelujah and the angel
[3:19:47] Gabriel was very
[3:19:49] angry for Gabriel to be
[3:19:52] angry you must have anger
[3:19:56] him Gabriel always brings good
[3:19:59] news he said I am
[3:20:02] Gabriel I stand in the presence of God
[3:20:07] and I've come to give you this good news
[3:20:09] and you're wasting my
[3:20:12] time there is a part they don't tell us
[3:20:16] but I'll tell to you before I continue
[3:20:18] reading that moment the angel struck
[3:20:22] Gabriel
[3:20:24] dumb couldn't talk
[3:20:31] anymore and that
[3:20:33] moment he left listen why did he do that
[3:20:37] because this man was an
[3:20:39] unbeliever he did oh my God he did he
[3:20:43] did not
[3:20:44] want God is word
[3:20:47] to be gossiped about by
[3:20:50] believer he wanted only the
[3:20:54] believer to talk about it listen brother
[3:20:58] if you believe the word God will open
[3:21:01] your
[3:21:01] mouth to speak and the Bible says forbid
[3:21:04] him not that
[3:21:07] speak amen because he has something to
[3:21:09] say but if you you don't believe the
[3:21:12] word you can't speak God will render you
[3:21:15] dumb
[3:21:20] and immediately he left Gabriel he left
[3:21:24] Zar and he went to the wife
[3:21:27] of he went to
[3:21:31] Elizabeth if you not believe me somebody
[3:21:34] El Believe Me In other words the angel
[3:21:37] said
[3:21:38] that unel what
[3:21:42] go will accomplish his word
[3:21:48] and if if zaras won't
[3:21:51] believe Elizabeth will Sur
[3:21:54] believe that part is not there but we'll
[3:21:56] know it how somehow later
[3:21:58] on because he immediately goes to uh you
[3:22:01] know the
[3:22:02] woman and tells the same same
[3:22:06] message and the woman must have
[3:22:10] beli I don't know what she
[3:22:13] did because the man was an unbeliever
[3:22:18] women are very
[3:22:20] wise the angel must have told the woman
[3:22:23] what to
[3:22:25] do for her to become
[3:22:28] pregnant because I believe it must not
[3:22:31] have been by the
[3:22:33] word because the word was only
[3:22:37] Christ John was a sinner like us are you
[3:22:41] following
[3:22:42] me so with with with Elizabeth Elizabeth
[3:22:46] it must have been physical involvement
[3:22:48] of a
[3:22:51] husband I believe it might have even
[3:22:53] been like how it was with Jacob and a
[3:22:59] mother you remember how it
[3:23:02] was oh he wants to give food es to give
[3:23:07] food go hunt and bring food my son you
[3:23:11] have to snatch the
[3:23:13] blessing put this thing on yourself
[3:23:16] go take this I will make it for you
[3:23:20] go
[3:23:21] bless I believe the angel Gabriel came
[3:23:24] to her and said this is what you have to
[3:23:26] do because this is the appointed
[3:23:29] time and the son will be called
[3:23:34] Jo and and and and and Elizabeth must
[3:23:37] have said
[3:23:39] amen I
[3:23:42] believe she went out of our way to
[3:23:44] believe
[3:23:45] it the Bible tells us later on listen as
[3:23:49] I read here praise the name of the
[3:23:54] Lord and when he came out he could not
[3:23:57] speak and they perceived that he had
[3:23:59] seen a vision in the
[3:24:01] temple he had seen a vision but he not
[3:24:05] believe the
[3:24:06] vision made him
[3:24:08] dumb brother believe the vision about
[3:24:11] your
[3:24:13] life sister believe the vision go wants
[3:24:16] you to
[3:24:23] walk and it came to pass that as soon as
[3:24:25] the days of his ministration were
[3:24:27] accomplished he departed to his own
[3:24:29] house and now listen to these last words
[3:24:31] and after those days his wife Elizabeth
[3:24:37] con and he herself five
[3:24:42] months saying thus has the Lord dealt
[3:24:45] with me in the days wherein he looked on
[3:24:48] me to take away my reproach among
[3:24:51] men and now later on on verse 59 I want
[3:24:56] and it came to pass that on the eighth
[3:24:58] day that they came to circumcise the
[3:25:00] child and they they called his name they
[3:25:02] called him zacharius after the name of
[3:25:04] his
[3:25:05] [Music]
[3:25:10] father this is how I'm able to know that
[3:25:12] the angel also went to marye
[3:25:17] and his mother
[3:25:19] answered and said no his name is not
[3:25:24] zakar was Elizabeth in the room when the
[3:25:26] angel was speaking to to
[3:25:34] Zacharias was she answer me church if
[3:25:38] you've been following was she she
[3:25:41] wasn't where did she get the news the
[3:25:45] angel must have gone
[3:25:47] her he said you will not call him Zar
[3:25:50] no he shall be called
[3:25:54] John Hallelujah am Elizabeth Elizabeth
[3:25:58] do I have an Elizabeth
[3:26:02] here and they said unto her no there's
[3:26:05] no one in your none of th Kindred that
[3:26:08] is called by this
[3:26:10] name and they made signs to his father
[3:26:15] [Music]
[3:26:16] what should we call your
[3:26:21] son and at that
[3:26:24] moment the Bible says told them give me
[3:26:26] a
[3:26:32] pen give me a pen and paper so I can
[3:26:36] write you couldn't
[3:26:42] talk they brought it brother don't

[3:26:47] not accepting God's
[3:26:52] Vision believe the
[3:26:55] vision believe the vision when you
[3:26:58] believe the vision you will not
[3:27:01] suffer you will not
[3:27:03] suffer amen hallelujah amen hallelujah
[3:27:07] amen from today don't be
[3:27:11] dumb don't be

[3:27:31] vision of the Lord for your
[3:27:32] life pray out loud glorify his name
[3:27:38] because you have a mouth that is open
[3:27:39] and a
[3:27:43] mother and finally he wrote
[3:27:50] joh which means he has now accepted the
[3:27:53] vision after much
[3:27:59] suffering and at that moment the Bible
[3:28:02] says his mouth was open
[3:28:06] immediately hallelujah hallelujah I
[3:28:09] charge you in the name of Jesus Christ
[3:28:12] to accept the vision right now for your
[3:28:15] life if you accept it God will open your
[3:28:19] mouth you will begin to praise God you
[3:28:23] will begin to glorify God and he would

[3:29:01] heart don't let the devil steal it from
[3:29:04] you hallelujah amen the Bible says and
[3:29:08] his tongue
[3:29:10] lose and he spoke and he praised God and
[3:29:15] fear upon all those that were in the
[3:29:18] house and it was noised abroad and it
[3:29:21] was noised
[3:29:23] [Music]
[3:29:24] abroad in that moment he had accepted it
[3:29:29] amen he became she became pregnant well
[3:29:32] of course she had already given back and
[3:29:34] at that moment the boy grew when both
[3:29:37] father and mother had accepted he was of
[3:29:41] the Lord and he was a prophet of God
[3:29:47] and he went before him in the power and
[3:29:48] the spirit of
[3:29:50] elah to turn the hearts of the fathers
[3:29:53] the elah before the first coming of
[3:29:56] Jesus
[3:29:57] Christ so much that when he Mary went
[3:30:01] and met
[3:30:03] Elizabeth this child was
[3:30:07] dead but when
[3:30:11] Elizabeth
[3:30:13] Mary Jesus in the womb of
[3:30:17] Mary gave
[3:30:19] life to
[3:30:22] John in the womb of
[3:30:26] Elizabeth and Elizabeth and and John was
[3:30:30] filled with the Holy
[3:30:32] SP in the womb of of
[3:30:36] his so what am I trying to say the
[3:30:40] appointed
[3:30:42] time
[3:30:44] come for the Messiah
[3:30:47] to come to the
[3:30:48] world but they had one to introduce
[3:30:52] him and that was John the Baptist John
[3:30:55] the Baptist had to be
[3:30:58] born I want to ask you a
[3:31:01] question what do you think of the
[3:31:04] Lord concerning your
[3:31:07] life certain things God May permitted
[3:31:12] for when she was pregnant when she was
[3:31:15] bared
[3:31:17] God was
[3:31:18] quiet until the time
[3:31:21] appointed then a baby came in her
[3:31:25] home what do you think of the
[3:31:27] Lord concerning your
[3:31:32] bar may we all
[3:31:40] stand now this is the moment you don't
[3:31:42] want to lose
[3:31:52] and when the angel of the Lord would
[3:31:53] move brother bham would
[3:31:59] preach and at the end of the
[3:32:04] meeting the angel of the Lord would show
[3:32:07] up and make good the things he had
[3:32:11] spoken

[3:32:21] potentials of that same thing

[3:32:28] really consecrated now at this
[3:32:34] time because the angel of the
[3:32:39] Lord is going to show
