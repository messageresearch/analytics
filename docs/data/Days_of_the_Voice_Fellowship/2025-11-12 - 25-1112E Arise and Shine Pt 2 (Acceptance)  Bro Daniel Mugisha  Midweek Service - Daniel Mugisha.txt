Hallelujah. How many happy to be here? Hallelujah. Or to all be happy because there is something great for us this evening. &gt;&gt; Don't look at brother Dan Brother. &gt;&gt; Just look at what God has prepared for you. Aina. Amen. As I was studying uh today, there's a message uh that touched so much my heart. Conference with God. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe this evening we can have a conference with God. And we all know that when they call that when they call people for a conference, there's something crucial that they're going to talk about. Hallelujah. Amen. So if God called you this evening, he has something for you this evening. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He has something for us. Every one of you that is here, the ones online, &gt;&gt; he has something for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're just going to go in the reading of the word. &gt;&gt; Isaiah chapter 1 vers 14 I think 20. &gt;&gt; Let us read. Your new moons and your new your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth. They are a trouble unto me. I am very weary to bear them. And when ye spread forth thy hands, I'll hide mine I'll hide mine eyes from you. Yeah. When you make many prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of of blood. Wash your uh wash wash you make make you clean. Put away the evil of your of your doings from before mine eyes. See to do evil. Learn to do well. Seek judgment. Relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. [clears throat] Come now and let us reason together, uh sayith the Lord. Though your sins are though your sins be as scallet, they shall be as white as as snow. Though they may be though they be red like uh crimson, they will be as wool. They shall be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land. But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword. For the mouth of the Lord has spoke has spoken it. forgiven. Fore! Foreign! Foreign! Fore! Foreign! Foreign! way. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. May the word of the Lord be blessed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can have your seats. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Today uh I just uh when I was praying I was uh God inspired me to again talk about rise and shine. This is our part two. But my context is not the simple context like &gt;&gt; like a a simple context of of this the the the title is rise and and shine but okay my subtitle is acceptance. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Uh so we're just going to continue with rising of the sun. Rising and sh rise and shine. Hallelujah. You know, I've just been interrupted when my brother's gone off. So pray for me to deliver something for you this evening. Hallelujah. So like last time we were sharing about rise and shine. Hallelujah. We saw that our light we we get our light from the Lord that we also reflect shine. We are the stars that get the light from the sun and shine. Like the moon they get the light from the sun and shine. Hallelujah. So this evening I'm just uh going to talk about acceptance. Accepting you you accepting yourself to rise and shine. Hallelujah. I hope everyone will really accept to rise and shine this evening. The Lord here through Isaiah, he's really rebuking he was rebuking Judah and uh he was rebuking Judah and Juzarim because of of the coldness because of the situation they were in. I mean um he say if you if you read the whole verse you'll hear him saying that what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifice unto me sayith the Lord. I am full of the burnt I am full of the burnt offerings of of lambs and the fat of fed beasts and I I delight not in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of of heigots. Hallelujah. So the the Lord just wants us to accept sometimes we are in a we are in a certain condition but we fail to accept that we are in that condition. Hallelujah. Sometimes we we we we we tend to close our eyes and say, "No, I'm I'm like I'm not in this. I'm not in this. I'm not in this. I'm just going to serve God." Amen. But yet, we have some things that are really hindering us. Hallelujah. That are really bringing us down. Amen. So, we ought to accept in order to rise, in order to have a change, you have to accept first and say, "Truly, I've gone astray. truly this is not right. You have to first accept it. You have to say I I know this is wrong. I know this is not right. Amina, &gt;&gt; I know something is not in the right uh position. Hallelujah. For you to rise again and shine. Amina, we are the people that are supposed to rise and shine this uh in this age. Amina, I feel so nervous, but just pray for me. I don't know why I'm feeling so nervous, but just pray for me. Hallelujah. Uh may God just help us because many times we we we fail truly to accept that we have gone astray. And yet we all want to rise and shine in all our endeavors, in our Christian lives, in our businesses, in our schools. You want to rise and shine in our businesses. want to rise and shine in everything want to rise and shine. Hallelujah. Is there anyone that does not want to rise and shine? All of us here even the ones online everyone even the ones in the world want to rise and shine. They were also some some want to be even better Christians. Aina but have failed to accept the condition they are in so to for for them to change. Amina may God just help us accept the condition and then move on. Let me read you some quote here. Uh brother Bernham was uh talking about the the children of Israel when they were on the journey to the promised land. The burdens of the people and the cries was so great till God had to had to be forced to call a conference. When God makes a decision, it's not to be that way. So he had already before the foundations of the foundation of the world, he had put a man on the lamb's book of life for the purpose of delivering them people. All things was pre-planned by God. The man's name was Moses, his servant. Hallelujah. So before the foundation of the world, Moses was was chos. And Moses had failed. Many of us have failed to live maybe a Christian life. Many of us maybe have failed to to break through. But listen to this. That should give give us cou this that should give us confidence and courage. We who have failed God, we still have hopes. We fail him as a church. We fail him as people. But let but but let's call a conference. Talk it over with him. See what's he what what he will tell us and and uh see what the decision we will derive at. Hallelujah. Let us call a conference this evening. You can call a conference with God. Amina and make things right and say, "Oh God, I really if your word says I'm I'm I'm the one going to rise and shine. Lord, may you make me be in my position. Help me be in my position. Help me really be be in my position. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May God just help us be in our positions. When he calls for a conference, he calls it as as I had said, he calls it when there's a crucial thing that he wants to discuss about. Hallelujah. Where his children fell in the garden of Eden, he called a conference. Amina. &gt;&gt; And he told they told him this one. Oh, Adam Adam was saying, "Oh, Eve that persuaded me to eat this. Oh no, the the the serpent." Many times we we fail because we we we we try to put the blame on people. We try to say, "Oh, this, oh this, oh God, oh this, oh God." But may we call our conference this evening to make things right. Hallelujah. and rise and shine again. Amen. I believe we are going to rise and shine in this generation. I believe what God said through our prophet will come to pass. I mean, a bride as as we talked last time, a bride has a short quick work. Friends, we are the people I want to repeat. We are the people going to rise and shine IN THIS GENERATION. YOU ARE THE PEOPLE. YOU you you yourself. You're the people going to rise and shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, &gt;&gt; if you just believe it, the children of Israel were were in Egypt suffering. They didn't know that they were the people going to bring down the armies of Farah. They they didn't know that there were a people going to bring Farah down. Abina, &gt;&gt; the devil may have caused us to have a stop in our lives. He may have caused us to have a stop in our Christian lives. HE MAY HAVE CAUSED us to have a stop in worshiping God, in really desiring to be more close to God, but you can call a conference. When they reached at the the Red Sea, they got stuck. They were hearing the the the horses, the armies coming. There's a a Red Sea. The mountains that are high that they could not climb, they were around them. Moses just went in a place. Amina, I believe everyone here, you can have your own. You can have a place right now. You can have a place at your home. And so God, I want you to intervene in this matter. Aina, I want you to intervene in this. Moses had to call God and they had a conference and he came and told the people, "Go forward." Hallelujah. He told them go forward. This evening we are going forward. Just accept that whatever the devil has brought, yes you may have brought it. Yes, when we look in our lives, you may say, "Yeah, truly I've been down." But today, it's you to accept and say, "Yes, I was down, but I'm no longer down." &gt;&gt; Amina, tell him this is the last day. Amina, &gt;&gt; there was the last day when the children of Israel saw the armies of Faroh the last time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can also see our our troubles in life for the last time. It can happen this evening. &gt;&gt; Amina, you just have to believe. You just have to get into the presence of God that is here and reason with him. He's calling us to reason with him. Hallelujah. And tell him, "Oh God, ju just come and search my heart." I mean, last time we read in the in the book of Proverbs, we saw it is the glory of God to conceal a thing, to hide a thing, but for the kings to to search it. Hallelujah. They are precious. God says there's a there's a through brother Bernham, we said there some pressures God's God puts on his children. I mean, but if we put it to the world, they would not manage it. Yes, we may be under pressure. God sometimes puts us under pressure. so that to to get something from it. Aina don't worry of your pressures. Sometimes you say, "Oh God, what's this? Oh God, this and this. Oh God, this and this." But I want to tell you this evening, don't be worried. Hallelujah. Don't be worried. God is with you. God is here to address everything. Amen. just accept and say, "Oh, God, really things have not been good." I mean, we saw in the Old Testament when anything would go wrong, they would check themselves and they say, "Oh, what's wrong? What's wrong?" Everyone, they would call for a fast, they would do this and this, they so everything can be right with God. Amina, we can have a conference, Amina, this evening. Hallelujah. We see Samson when things turned around that he didn't expect. He called a conference with God. I mean, he called a conference with God. People may say that he didn't rise and shine because he died with his enemies, but to me I say he rise and shined. &gt;&gt; That's why we read we read about him. That's why we say once more Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because of of Samson I mean he accepted his condition he said oh God truly I'm sorry he accepted his condition friends I do not say this maybe to to be judgmental but this as we said last TIME TO IGNITE WHAT IS in you I mean this is not judgmental this is not all about judgmental to ANYONE BUT TO IGNITE [screaming] WHAT IS IN YOU the seed that is in YOU HALLELUJAH THIS WORD IS preached to water the seed that is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. This word is not to condemn any of God's Yes. It condemns us so that for a good purpose. Amen. Not to condemn us to bring death but to bring life. &gt;&gt; Amen. To help US RISE AND SHINE AGAIN AS CHILDREN of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I declare arise and shine in THIS CHURCH. I DECLARE RISE AND SHINE IN YOUR LIFE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT IS YOURS. [screaming] IT IS MINE. I mean there's no one going to shine. It is us going to shine in this generation. &gt;&gt; When we read about other people in in other church ages, they rose and show and had to shine. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is now our time. &gt;&gt; The devil cannot stop it. He's too late to stop it. Amina, it's just too late. Just call for a conference and accept. You'll see yourself rising and shining again. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is our time. Tell your neighbor, it is your time to shine. I I don't know how best I can bring it, but it is our time to shine. &gt;&gt; Amina, you are the bride. It is there's no more time, friends. This is the end time. This is the end time. It is the time for the bride. Amina, &gt;&gt; I don't believe that we we can just be dream. We are going to rise and shine. We are rising. There's an army rising. GOING TO SHINE GOING TO OUTSHINE THE ARMY OF THE DEVIL. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; There's an army rising. And there's there's no like it is not anywhere like last time I told you that there's no people going to come from another planet that are the peculiar people. You are the people friends. Sometimes we when uh uh when we preach these things tend to be to normalize you. But don't make it normal to you. MAKE IT A SPECIAL MESSAGE EVERY DAY WHEN YOU HEAR IT. WHEN YOU READ THE WORD OF GOD, MAKE IT A SPECIAL message to you. Hallelujah. FOR THE WORD OF GOD IS a love letter &gt;&gt; to the bride. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; May you never get used of of of hearing that GOD IS MY HEALER. GOD IS MY REDEEMER. NEVER GET USED OF IT EVERY DAY. LET IT BE NEW TO YOU. AMINA, &gt;&gt; may it be new to you. May it be new to me that WHEN YOU YOU HEAR OF IT, YOU GET IGNITED. YOU RISE and shine and tell the devil he has he has no way &gt;&gt; in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just don't want to listen to what the devil can say. Sometimes truly you are you're between the the a hard place and and a rock. You don't know what to do. BUT THERE'S A GOD THAT CAN MAKE A WAY. HALLELUJAH. THERE'S A GOD THAT CAN TURN ON the light. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Friends, I want to tell you God is real. Never get no like don't make it normal that when we say God is real, God is real. When we say God is here, he's truly here. We are now having a conference with God. He's checking your hearts right now. Amina, &gt;&gt; just let him in. Let him in. Hallelujah. If you could just let God in and accept and say, "Oh, God, may you just come in, you'll see a change in your life." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll see a move in your life. I mean uh it's only God that can make a difference. I mean uh many times like we we we we put our official lights we we make our own like our own way of praising God or our own way of doing things so that we can maybe like uh make God happy. But he has said here like when he hears the the the the in the incense, they stink in his nose. The first chapter of uh of of Isaiah, he said they stink when you go back home, read that chapter. Truly, it moves the child of God. It really moves when you when you see that may your own works, your own doings m to nothing. Let's just accept God and say, "Oh God, may you come in." Hallelujah. There's an offer being given to you this evening. Hallelujah. Has we started in business uh like uh there's an offer in essential things of a contract. There's an offer. There's a consideration and an acceptance. Aina. So God is giving us an offer to rise and shine. Amina the consideration is you rising. It is the word of God being like a uh like the way they say in the the the business world they say job security. This is the security of your consideration. The word of God is the security of your consideration. I mean, you consider it because the word of God is true. He never lies. He's not a man that can lie. I mean, he's not a man that can fail when he gives you an offer that when you look at it and say, "Ah, that cannot happen. He has given it to us." A mean is not a man that you should lie. Hallelujah. is telling us this evening, may we rise and shine. May we rise and shine. If you feel it is hard for it, rise and shine. Have a conference with God. Amen. Go tell him. Sometimes we pray and we think maybe God is not hearing. We pray and pray, you cry, you think he's not hearing. He's hearing every bit of your voice, every bit of your thought. &gt;&gt; Amina, &gt;&gt; whatever you're thinking now, you already he has already heard it. Amina. So when he promises in his word, it is true. Amen. Maybe we maybe some in critical moments like Samson some don't know what next some don't know what best thing they can do to persuade God to work on their issue maybe you have tried almost everything but he's calling for conference today amina is calling you through his word. You may say, "Where is God? Where is God? If he's calling me now, where is he?" He's here. Hallelujah. He's here to just have a conference with with you. You've not come here to meet a preacher. All these things that we are reading, we are not getting them from our heads. You can also go at home and read them. Everything that is here, whatever I'm reading, whatever verse I'm reading, whatever quote I may read, you can go back and read. BUT WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF COMING HERE? WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONFERENCE that the Lord is calling today? There is something he wants to talk about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is something he wants to address. May you just open up your heart and may you let him address your matters. Hallelujah. Many things may have stopped us truly. Like the children of Israel, they they they called for halt because of whatever was around, because of what what the devil had brought around to instill fear in them. The devil sometimes bring things to instill fear in you. But friends, I want to tell you, don't fear. Hallelujah. I was reading Psalms uh 23. Though in the valley of death, I shall not want. I shall not want the what the devil can give me. The devil may try to give you some uh painkillers. But there's A CURE OF ALL YOUR TROUBLE. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to take a painkiller. I want to take a cure. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want take a cure of all your problems. Amen. There's a God that can give cure. Amen. There's a God beyond a doctor. There's a God beyond a father that can provide. There's a a God beyond a business that you have. There's a GOD BEYOND A JOB that you have. &gt;&gt; Aina, &gt;&gt; we see the lady with the little oil. There's a God who can add more and more and more. Hallelujah. Is you are having to accept accept the offer that the Lord is giving you. Accept it with all your heart. Amina sometimes we accept and want God to act in a way that we want but God has his provided way in everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. God has a provided way in each one's lives. The way he provides me he may not provide you like that. The way he provides an he may not provide to to you like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everyone has a way God deals with them. Amina I do not say these things because they have been said. I do not talk about them that because other preachers have TALKED ABOUT THEM. I'VE SEEN them happening. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you've not seen them happening in your life, seeing God making a way where there's no way. You may have read about the children of Israel that God just split the sea so they can have a way. But God has split many seas in our lives. Amen. But we we just we just want to see it in our own ways. But God has splitted many. Amen. God has worked in our lives many times. But because we are blinded by what the world says by by what maybe what you think you fail to see what God is doing in your life. I mean we always see what God has done before and we are always hoping of what God is going to do but we FAIL TO SEE WHAT God is doing in our lives. &gt;&gt; I want to challenge you. God hasn't God been faithful today? I can despise that God has been faithful. &gt;&gt; You know the people that are not even dead, the ones that are bedridden now many last time I was sharing Sunday school when you watch news you see people suffering. Sometimes I look at myself I say I have not yet suffered. You look at people in Arab countries suffering. in wars every day of their lives. They don't have a house. They don't have food. Even if they have the money, it will not help them. But have you thought of what God has done in your life? Have you thought of the peace that God has given in your life? Amina may God just help us accept his provided way and rise and shine once again. Amina because we shall not shine the way the world may think that we are going to shine. That's the truth. Don't wait to to shine. Maybe some people think that uh having uh like property, having uh like uh these worldly things maybe land what those are the blessings. The best blessing that God can give you is salvation. &gt;&gt; All these things shall pass away. &gt;&gt; Amina if you HAVE THE SALVATION RISE AND SHINE. AINA PORTRAY THAT LIGHT THAT IS in you. It is not your light that is shining. It's God's light. Aina just accept God's provided way. Amen. And you'll see the light shining in your life. Hallelujah. We have seen God's children in different ways shining in their lives. The people, all the people we read about in the Bible, that is the shining I'm talking about. Hallelujah. Bringing out what you're supposed to bring out. Aina, the fruits of God in you. Hina, that's what is called shining. Aina when you see a a a a flower when it comes out and blossoms it is shining in its nature. What nature are we in? The nature of God. Amen. So we ought to shine like God. Sometimes we we come here and sing to be like Jesus. We always sing it and he jump, he danced. But have you ever thought of what Jesus was when he was a man? Have you ever thought about it? But in who like who is the greatest celebrity in this world that his name has been moving ages and ages and ages and ages? It is not the rich man that was there 2,000 years ago. It is Jesus that we are still talking about. That's what they call shining. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Accept God's provided way of shining. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And move on with with your life. The Jesus want to be like to be like to be like he didn't have a house. Have I lied &gt;&gt; yet? He has everything. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But we desire to be like him and is the light that we are drawing to be like him. Amen. May we just accept of God's provided way. Aina your light may be small but is what God has given you. Hallelujah. May we just uh giving ourselves just surrender everything and uh and call God if maybe you failed to see the light because of the things that have blinded you because of the things that are that are that are around you. I want you to just see the light uh this evening. The light of God that we always talk about is calling you to accept and rise and shine. He's giving you an offer. Let me read you this quotation uh here in the message. What think ye of Christ? It was preached in 1950 57. It says now a pardon is not a pardon unless it is accepted as a pardon. I I I I read I read an act I read an act some time ago where where that there was a man in the east eastern country. It had been many years ago since the incident happened. But the man was guilty and uh uh was guilty and was sentenced to death and a firing squad and some good man went to work and worked around the the governor of the state until finally they persuaded the governor to spare the life of the person. And when the guilty p the the guilty person who was really guilty was set free to get another chance to bring himself upon to bring himself up and make a and and make make a citizen. When the man uh come with the pardon, the man was was to die, refused to receive it. He did not want it. Yet the governor had his name signed pardoned. Amina, what makes what what made the difference was the governor's name and the pardon. It spelled pardon to the man. If he wanted to receive it, but if he did not want to receive it, he had to pay the penalty. Aina and the man refused it and said, "I do not believe it. I will not accept it. And the man was shot the following day. Then this pardon goes back to the governor and he had pardoned the man yet he had he was a corpse. Then it was it it was tried in the the Supreme Court of the land and it was declared that a pardon is not a pardon unless it is accepted. And salvation through Jesus Christ is not salvation unless it IS ACCEPTED AS SALVATION. OH, IF THE WORLD COULD ONLY LOOK ON God's greatest promises and believe them that they they are God's burden to the human race. AMEN. GOD IS BURDENING US. AINA FOR YOU TO RISE AND shine in your Christian life TO RISE AND SHINE IN YOUR all your endeavors. Amen. But we have failed to accept it. We have failed. He's saying the consideration was the name and the burden. He's giving us an a an offer. Aina &gt;&gt; and he's putting a consideration that consider this but your part is to accept that's why God created a man on free moral agency it's to accept I said I believe it I'll go with it all the way all the way I've drawn the line I will goina And when decide when you make such a decision, let me tell you friends, there's not always even your energy or your your by your own uh doing that you're going to rise and shine. It's just you making up a decision and say whatever comes I'm going to rise AND SHINE BECAUSE GOD HAS SAID IT, it is a finished work. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. is a finished work. Look at the thief at a cross. He accepted that I was a thief. He said, "But remember me. It's just a matter of accepting. Accept your condition. If don't try to play Christianity because you'll not play it forever, &gt;&gt; you're going to fail. You're going to fail if you play Christianity. You may hide. You may say, "Now I'm out of I'm now at school or I'm now at uh maybe I'm with my friends. They don't know that I'm a believer. So, I can do whatever I want." Some I will see you. Amina &gt;&gt; and and will be recorded and when the last conference comes everything will be brought out which is the judgment day. Friends I I do not preach this or I do not want to give you this message. I don't want you to take it as a judgmental message. It may seem so condemning but I I just want to take it as a message that can ignite your soul. Amina that will make you accept what God can do in your life. &gt;&gt; Amina, this message can do it. It has done it before. It is doing it now and is going to do it after. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Hallelujah. It only takes you to believe it. Amina, it is our season to believe God's word. There's no more other seasons coming. This is the season. If you're expecting another one, my brother, you'll be a preacher in the tribulation. If you can't do anything for God this moment, if you can't accept God, you'll try to accept him in tribulation when you cannot even because of the conditions that will be there. &gt;&gt; This is our time to rise and shine. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THE WORD OF GOD DECLARES THAT WE are rising and shining. An army is rising and shining. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. An army is rising and shining. You may think these are just words, but these are not my words. I have no even authority to tell you my words when I'm behind the desk. These are the what God has put on my heart. When God wants to give a message, he has a mouthpiece. Today he may use me. Tomorrow he may use Dixon. Next time he may use Aranius. Next time he may use Brother Martin. He may use Joel. He may use anyone. Hallelujah. It is as accepting. Aina. An offer is given to us. An offer is given to everyone. Hallelujah. Brother Abraham here in redemption by power. He said, "All right, put on your shock proof jackets." Now, this is uh not for for someone that uh still shaking shaking, but he's saying, "Put on shockproof jackets." Hallelujah. Here it comes. Look, every man that rejects lights, that rejects light, goes blind and walks in darkness. Because you do not accept light. Amen. God sends ministers that preach the gospel. He sends signs and wonders among men to vindicate it to be the truth. And men reject it. There is nothing left but DARKNESS FOR YOU. WALK in the light while the light is shining. &gt;&gt; My brother, receive the light. &gt;&gt; Christ is the light. &gt;&gt; He is coming to bring the light to you. &gt;&gt; But those who reject light re receive darkness. And every man and woman tonight who rejects light, walks in darkness, NOT KNOWING WHERE HE IS GOING, is staggering again. is staggering along pretty good popular with the people but wonder stands in the presence of God. We go around with people want to be attached with like popular people, famous people. You want to be some guy that will be talked about, but that is not the light that we are talking about. Amina, that's just darkness. You're just looking at darkness. Amina, may we accept the light. Because we do not light our own light. We reflect the light of Jesus Christ. I don't want to tell you that you're going to be talked about in this world that you like that nah that is the light. Ah some will even reject it. They say that can never be the light. Hallelujah. But the light Jesus Christ is shining today. He's shining today. May you accept him to shine in your life. &gt;&gt; Aina accept him today. &gt;&gt; Your light may be dim. Aina, but he's here to pardon us. Let us just accept the pattern that he has given us. May we accept it. It is not to say yeah my friends sometimes gets rough but when it gets rough what I I know and I believe that God always makes a way. He provides a way for your for for for for your safety for your survival. Amina you you think Stefan would just bear the death like stoning him as a man? There is something that enabled him to endure. Hallelujah. There is something that enabled Jesus Christ to endure the cross. He was a man, 100% a man and 100% God, a man dying for you. Amen. So that our light can shine. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May God just help us to make the light shine in our lives. There's an offer tonight. There's an offer for everyone to rise and shine. Rise and shine all the bride. Hallelujah. Here in the seven church ages, brother Bernham says, "Oh church of the living God, RISE AND SHINE." LOOK, you don't realize I wish I had some kind of a shock that I could give you somehow. I wish THE HOLY SPIRIT COULD COME IN HIS GREAT POWER and move you to a place THAT YOU WOULD GRAB THE BIBLE AND SAY, "Let me look into this." When you see nations are breaking, Israel awake are awakening the signs that that the Bible for told Gentile's day is numbered. Hallelujah. Return or despise or dispass to your own. Hallelujah. The redemption, the day of redemption is near. Hallelujah. But our hearts are failing for fear. We fear to li to to rise and shine. Aina, may we trim our lamps clear and rise and shine. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May God just help us rise and shine. Amina, may this word just be like a spank. Brother Bam talks about a a baby that was born and the baby seemed to be dead. They they hold the legs and they have to give him some slaps for the baby to again breathe and have life. I MEAN THIS WORD may be that spank in your life. You can apply it yourself right now by accepting that I want to rise and shine. I want to rise and shine in this generation. Just accept those banks. That's why they make they make a baby even to cry that somehow they're painful. The word sometimes comes when it is painful when it will let you live very many things. If you read the the history of the Bible, people gave in their lives to make this light shine. If you look at the way they killed people, they hung them upside down. They cut them. They divide them for this light to shine so we can have a testimony. Hallelujah. Let me tell you friends even the the riches of this world those are just uh God just adds them to us but it's not the main thing we see even brother Benham says uh 80% or 90% of Jesus's ministry they were like healing doing miracles but he had a message through them after they were used to attract other people so that he can deliver a message. Amen. Sometimes God gives us blessings in life but the same blessings that the the things that he has given us they sometimes the ones that hind us and you say oh I'm busy all this all this and instead of lighting for you you may think you're lighting but you're dimina But child of God, you can rise and shine. Hallelujah. It is our time to rise and shine friends. It's our time. There's no more time. I don't know how how many times I can speak it, but it's our time. If it is not your time, if you think this is not your, it is my time to rise and shine and reflect my God. Amina when I s me being my time to rise and shine. It's not that you're going to hear my name everywhere that D is this and oh Danny. No, sometimes even there are many stars that are shining. Many stars that are shining right now in glory that you didn't even hear of. Just you had their works. I mean, you had their works. Yes. Sometimes you can hear the names. Hallelujah. Which is not bad. A mean. May we not call for sometimes we we we we when we call for for help to a stop that when things are are heavy on us sometimes we stop for long. AINA BUT IN GOD there's no stopping for long. I not say that sometimes we don't stop in our journey as we see the children of Israel. Sometimes things get rough and you stop and you feel weary and it's all God what next can I do? But in a God gives you strength and you move again. Hallelujah. When you stop for long, the devil will give you his ideas. A mean he will give you the the ways that maybe may make you feel better, but I'm telling you, he's just giving you painkillers. But there's a cure of everything. Hallelujah. May we accept Amina and reflect the light of our God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the message, the great shining light. Brother Bam asked a question. What are we to do then to rise and shine? Amen. Rise and shine the light of God to to the to the dying in the darkness of this world. We are to reflect the to reflect the shine the shine and to reflect and shine the presence of the Lord Jesus in his uh resurrection power. Hallelujah. He is yesterday so he is today to reflect him. Hallelujah. But remember then the star again when it is it's it finished it finished its course. It takes no honor. Hallelujah. They start just brought the men to their destination. Aina and showed them the perfect light. And we as members of the body of Christ this even this morning he preached it in the morning but this evening friends we are God's light but we take no honor to ourselves. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When we have got out, when we have got our patient and our person that we are leading, when we have got them, we must disown ourselves and lead them to the great and perfect light which shine to light the way of every man that cometh in the world into the world. Hallelujah. The Lord Jesus Christ, not a myth called Santa uh Santa Claus, not some church by denomination, but the true and perfect light, Jesus Christ, the son of the living God. Hallelujah. We approaching even Christmas. You'll hear the Santa Santa Santa Claus, Father Christmas, what and what everyone will maybe want to to have him in the house. What and what? Hallelujah. But here, brother Bernham is telling us that our Jesus is not the Santa Claus. Hallelujah. that when we bring people when we are leading people Aina lead them to the great light the star does not bring honor to themselves I mean maybe when God has has given you a chance to have a testimony that you're going to give the bride some people may think that the ones that made it a testimony that God gives you it is to edify ify the body of Christ not to bring honor to you but to bring honor to God. Hallelujah. And then you the light shining. Hallelujah. When Jesus rises and shines in your life, when he rises because of you and he shines in someone's life, then all of you are doing what? A rising and shining. Hallelujah. Because we believe that we are the body and Jesus is the head. Aina May we enable may we pray so much that God can help us and let the light shine in our lives. Amenina may God just help us. May God just help everyone. Hallelujah. If you want, if you hunger for God, if you want God more close to you, he's here. He's giving you an offer, it is you to accept it. Hallelujah. For you to rise and shine. Hallelujah. I think my time is almost up. Let us read this quotation. And uh like uh for let me tell you I'm going to speak of the last conference will ever be held. Aina this is not the last conference. Even if Jesus has to come today or after this service, this is not the last conference. I want to tell you that there's another conference, the last one that will be held. Hallelujah. God be merciful. Only one thing will stand there reconciled. That's the judgment. And the only thing you will be reconciled by is when you are you you have accepted the blood of Jesus Christ as your pardon and been filled with his spirit. There's a conference where every man will meet, every woman will meet, every child will meet. Children you've had you'll also be there. There's a place selected where the conference will be held and there will be a great white throne judgment set. God has permitted his prophets to look in and say the the books were opened and another book which is the book of life 10,000 times 10 thou 10,000 of ministers and angels minister to him. Hallelujah. Then it was written, if the righteous be scarcely saved, where will the sinner and ungodly appear? What will be your stand at the conference? You'll have you will have bypassed all of them. This is one of the conference you may have bypassed. But I believe God has given us a chance. He has given us a chance to accept and have a conference with him. Aina and have a conference with him. Hallelujah. Huh? You might have bypassed all of them down through your life. You may walk out of this door this morning. He preached it in the morning. But you may walk out this evening and bypass this one. But my friend, you will never bypass that one. You are going to be there for it was once appointed onto men to die. But after that, the judgment there will be there will be the great conference where we will all stand together and we will all have an account for this morning for this evening of this earthly conference. that we have held. Hallelujah. We have had a conference. Friends, it is our duty as the bride to rise and shine. Amina, may we rise and shine. Amina, our fathers, the four believers had rise and shine. Our prophet had rise and shine. Hallelujah. When I say he had to rise and shine, it is not that his name is known all over that many people know him but he reflected Jesus Christ in his life. Amen. So it is our duty to rise and shine friends. Hallelujah. As the musicians are coming, I want to tell you it is my duty. It is your duty to rise and shine. Hallelujah. We have heard the word. Everything most of the things I've read so much today. Amina and most of what I've been saying the scriptures. We have heard that the word is is calling us rise and shine. Accept rise and shine. Amina, I want to remind you, you're not going to shine by yourself, but by the light, by the sun, Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Last time we heard that we are going to rise and shine because of we are ignited by the word of God. Amen. The word of God is again igniting us. You cannot you cannot even let this night pass that you can say ah ah enough is enough that you can say enough is Enough friends. This word calls us all of us to rise and shine. Aina to rise and reflect our God. We have had artificial lights in our lives. Maybe we have pretended enough to try to light. But there's a true light going to shine that is shining now that is going to shine after which is Jesus Christ. And if you're attached to him, I want to tell you, you're going to rise and shine also. Hallelujah. The devil thought that Jesus Christ was doomed when he he killed him at the cross, but he never knew that that was the moment that Jesus was going was rising to shine. Hallelujah. The devil may have stripped you thinking, "God, this one is done. He may have taken almost everything. But he has forgotten that there's a man that turns on the light. And that man is right here. If you want to turn on your light, if you want to rise and shine, the man that turns on the light is here. Friends, I do not speak these things because I've read the message or because I've heard the message. But is a conviction that I feel, it is an inspiration that I feel on my heart to tell you people, if you just accept it. There's no more time, friends. Do whatever you can. Do whatever you can. You can accept now and say, "Oh God, maybe things have these worldly things have made us so busy that have caused our light to dim." But I want to remind you, you are the people that are going to light here in Nongo. Hallelujah. You're the people that are lighting. Different churches are stationed in different places around the country. They're lighting, lighting, lighting. Amina and I believe we are going to come together as one light. Hallelujah. Time is no more friends. Don't feel judged. just feel as something that has tried to push you to be what you're supposed to be because this word that I may have talked about today when I pre when when we preachers come and speak about it is not that you're going to be a believer that moment or or maybe oh you're oh it is making you a child of God today I'm not I'm not making you and I will never and no preacher is going to make you a child of God. You're already a child of God. But this is to just awaken you. Amina, awaken you in such a moment. Say, "Hey, rise and shine." Because you're created to rise and shine. Amina, the sun rises from is it the west? From the east to the west every day since God created it. Amina since God created it. So we are the people that are reflecting God's light. Amina, may God bless you. Rash shalom. You can come. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, I want to thank you this moment, oh God. want to thank you Lord for this opportunity that you've given us oh Lord.
