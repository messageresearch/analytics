[29:56] we are reading chapter
[29:58] verse 4th was five to eleven
[30:04] foreign
[30:08] foreign
[30:47] this is a a big lengthy subject
[30:52] I've spoken on it before speaking on
[30:58] gideoni but today we're going to check
[31:00] another approach and maybe in the
[31:02] following Services we will see how the
[31:03] horses
[31:11] we begin with verse 5.
[31:17] but we preach not ourselves but Christ
[31:20] Jesus the Lord and ourselves your
[31:23] servants for Jesus is sake
[31:26] for God
[31:27] who commanded the light to shine out of
[31:31] Darkness has shined in our hearts to
[31:35] give the light of the knowledge of the
[31:37] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[31:41] but we have this treasure in Athen
[31:43] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[31:46] may be of God and not of us we are
[31:50] troubled on every side yet not
[31:52] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[31:56] despair
[31:57] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[32:01] but not destroyed
[32:04] always bearing about in the body the
[32:08] dying of the Lord Jesus that the life
[32:10] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[32:13] our body for we which leave are always
[32:18] delivered unto death for Jesus's sake
[32:21] and the life also of Jesus might be made
[32:25] manifest in our mortal flesh
[32:29] foreign
[32:59] foreign
[33:22] [Music]
[33:25] foreign
[33:37] [Music]
[33:46] foreign
[34:49] foreign
[35:50] [Music]
[35:57] Ministry has quite a nice a nice
[36:00] Ministry
[36:07] and also Pasta Pasta is a teacher
[36:12] yeah so
[36:14] come come ready come with a pen come
[36:17] with a pepper I'm sure you will learn
[36:18] many new things for the first time
[36:24] [Music]
[36:31] I'm sure his ministry will also be a
[36:33] blessing to us
[36:36] but tonight you are stuck with
[36:39] mysterious
[36:42] and I'm going to speak to you on uh
[36:46] treasure in other universities
[36:50] foreign
[37:03] who commanded the light to shine out of
[37:06] Darkness has shined in our hearts to
[37:09] give the light of the knowledge of the
[37:10] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[37:19] [Music]
[37:27] so first of all we need to understand
[37:30] what is this treasure it is
[37:33] [Music]
[37:35] he is saying that this treasure has been
[37:39] placed in an Athen vessels
[37:51] you know when you it is a bit weird you
[37:54] have a treasure you don't really keep it
[37:56] in something as as fragile as a poor and
[38:30] [Music]
[38:35] a little journey to find out what this
[38:37] treasure is
[38:41] so before I spoke about the treasure in
[38:44] this treasure in other investors
[38:53] and it says for God who commanded the
[38:56] light to shine out of Darkness
[39:04] [Music]
[39:10] [Applause]
[39:30] don't just hear the scripture I wanted
[39:32] to think about it
[39:41] out of Darkness
[39:45] how could the light shine out of
[39:47] Darkness
[39:49] because you know in the book of in the
[39:52] Book of Genesis it says in the beginning
[39:54] Genesis 1 1 in the beginning God created
[39:57] the Heaven and the Earth
[39:59] foreign
[40:25] so and the alpha was without form
[40:29] and void and darkness was upon the first
[40:32] of the day
[40:40] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[40:42] face of the waters
[40:46] and now listen to verse three
[40:50] if you can read it read it in your Bible
[40:53] and if you read that first person
[40:59] and God said
[41:10] now
[41:11] for God commanded
[41:14] katonda this is what he says in the book
[41:17] of Corinthians
[41:19] so God commanded
[41:23] the light to shine out of darkness
[41:28] in Genesis it says and God said
[41:37] right the same God who said let there be
[41:42] light
[41:44] um
[41:44] the one Paul is talking about in
[41:47] Corinthians
[41:52] for light to shine out of darkness
[41:58] and here in Genesis how they be
[42:00] commanded by simply saying let there be
[42:03] life
[42:06] was the light there is
[42:10] and there was like
[42:13] and God saw the light
[42:16] that it was good and God divided the
[42:18] light from the darkness
[42:24] so what is this treasure
[42:29] is the ability to command
[42:34] this treasure is the heaviness of the
[42:37] word of God
[42:38] [Music]
[42:41] is the word of God that is
[42:58] something out of nothing
[43:00] [Music]
[43:02] this is the treasure we're talking about
[43:06] and God said
[43:14] Hallelujah and this is a treasure
[43:18] for God who commanded the light to shine
[43:21] out of Darkness
[43:25] now he brings it from Genesis
[43:28] and he brings it down to us and he says
[43:32] he has shined in our hearts
[43:37] that same God
[43:40] who commanded the light to shine out of
[43:42] Darkness
[43:44] not a second person
[43:47] not a fat person
[43:50] let there be light
[43:54] he that God has shined in our heart all
[43:58] you can turn yourself
[44:01] Hallelujah I mean who is that God
[44:03] everybody said Jesus Christ
[44:09] and in Hebrews 11 3 says through faith
[44:13] we understand that the worlds were
[44:16] framed by the word of God
[44:24] so that things which are seen we are not
[44:26] made out of things which do appear yeah
[44:35] we understand that the words were
[44:37] affirmed by the word of God
[44:43] we understand that that same God has
[44:46] shined in our hearts
[44:51] through faith we understand with the
[44:54] things which are seen are not made of
[44:56] the things which do appear
[44:59] together
[45:04] by faith that's why as a Christian
[45:08] foreign
[45:26] [Music]
[46:08] that's why a Christian is able to
[46:10] profess what the word cannot professions
[46:53] now this is
[46:57] an everlasting treasure
[47:00] somebody tell somebody that the treasure
[47:03] is the word of God hallelujah
[47:29] the word of God will never pass away
[47:33] and we are Christians because we have
[47:36] been preached to uh
[47:39] we have faith to believe
[47:43] to believe
[47:46] it's all about the world
[47:50] is that's what makes a difference
[47:54] because
[47:57] we believe the world
[48:00] regardless of the situation but afraid
[48:03] you believe the world
[48:11] regardless of what the word brings out
[48:14] to you believe the world
[48:17] and on the word of God
[48:20] something within you build
[48:26] because of the word of God
[48:29] the things I see and into the end that's
[48:32] made out of things
[48:41] you know you begin to believe things
[48:44] that will be considered that you are
[48:46] crazy
[48:50] others will begin to have their own
[48:53] explanations to be to explain things
[48:56] away
[49:01] they will tell you no there is a big
[49:03] banger Theory
[49:15] and then you will want to believe that
[49:20] something within your souls
[49:30] I believe that there was something this
[49:33] is
[49:38] the same thing that has created me
[49:42] that is the same thing that put me in
[49:44] the womb of my mouth
[49:51] that's the same thing that has been
[49:53] carrying me through my life's journey
[50:03] that is my pleasure yeah
[50:41] my words shall never never now
[50:52] you know Heaven and Earth is
[50:58] hmm
[50:59] but the uh gambo how did heaven and not
[51:03] come into existence
[51:09] meaningless things that the world that
[51:13] the world has created
[51:16] could pass away
[51:19] but the world remains are constant now
[51:23] my words will never pass away
[51:29] and the prophet says in a message on
[51:32] report now my words is the words of a
[51:35] man
[51:39] that's like my words are words
[52:30] [Music]
[53:05] if Christ is in you it is
[53:15] I mean
[53:17] Colossians 1 27 says to whom God would
[53:20] make known what is the riches of the
[53:22] glory of this mystery among the Gentiles
[53:24] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[53:27] is
[53:40] other questions one
[53:43] is

[54:27] what did he say in the beginning
[54:34] for God who commands the light to shine
[54:36] out of Darkness

[54:42] to give the light you can just say
[54:44] whatever to give the light of knowledge
