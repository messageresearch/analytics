[1:14:24] you I think this is Brother CB's little
[1:14:27] brother
[1:14:29] yes yes uh brother calb told me about
[1:14:34] you a certain
[1:14:37] Institute the name of that
[1:14:43] Institute okay he just close he will be
[1:14:47] fellowshipping here while he's at
[1:14:53] the and uh he he was he was first of all
[1:14:57] you know greeting The church
[1:15:00] here his name is brother
[1:15:03] Joshua and uh he told me a lot of things
[1:15:06] but I just read a
[1:15:10] few he says um I've been following your
[1:15:16] preachings online and they have been a
[1:15:18] blessing to
[1:15:19] me both from the
[1:15:22] conventions and also the DV
[1:15:26] Uganda I really enjoy and get blessed by
[1:15:28] the
[1:15:32] meetings he he said also recently I
[1:15:35] listened to the sermon you preached
[1:15:37] about approach to
[1:15:42] marriage and it really was a big eye
[1:15:45] opener sermon to
[1:15:47] me and I have been sharing that link of
[1:15:50] of of that preaching to friends to
[1:15:52] listen to it
[1:15:57] even this evening actually but almost a
[1:15:59] month ago I I listened to
[1:16:05] it and uh he says I wrote many notes out
[1:16:09] of
[1:16:11] that and there are some things you were
[1:16:13] just saying like directly to
[1:16:17] me and he said I appreciate you for that
[1:16:20] someon so you also wrote a lot of other
[1:16:23] things here
[1:16:26] he's a graduate from uh I think Kenyata
[1:16:32] University and uh he in Nairobi at this
[1:16:35] at this
[1:16:36] time so this young man asked me to greet
[1:16:39] you and I thought it was wonderful to
[1:16:42] you know hear we usually from time to
[1:16:45] time hear from many uh especially the
[1:16:47] young
[1:16:49] people you know from sometimes from the
[1:16:53] usya South Africa Europe from many
[1:16:57] countries around the world and we are
[1:16:59] happy if we can be a blessing to you
[1:17:02] know even if it is one
[1:17:06] person and that is why we do stream our
[1:17:10] services because you know we were not
[1:17:13] told to uh Minister only to one
[1:17:19] locality Jesus told us to go all over
[1:17:21] the
[1:17:22] world and and nowadays even easier with
[1:17:27] internet and there's another young man
[1:17:29] who also I heard
[1:17:32] from take the time to read the messages
[1:17:34] but you know he gave me the testimony on
[1:17:37] how he received the
[1:17:39] H and it all started in the youth
[1:17:41] meetings
[1:17:43] year and you know how God is using him
[1:17:47] now there's a prophecy that was given to
[1:17:49] our brother at the end of the
[1:17:53] meetings but the brother said when I
[1:17:56] heard that as I was hearing that I knew
[1:17:57] that God was speaking to me
[1:18:03] directly and he said you know he did not
[1:18:07] even know but later on he realized that
[1:18:09] God had called him into the
[1:18:12] ministry if you're going to influence
[1:18:14] one person to to go into the
[1:18:20] ministry I believe that is a big
[1:18:23] deal why because
[1:18:26] you know one person is going to destroy
[1:18:27] many
[1:18:29] demons praise the name of so the Lord is
[1:18:33] good and many who also sent their
[1:18:35] greetings where I have
[1:18:38] been I was in
[1:18:42] Ethiopia we had one service with the
[1:18:44] Saints
[1:18:46] there pastoras sent his
[1:18:49] greetings in the name of Jesus
[1:18:51] Christ and also many other believers me
[1:18:55] to greet
[1:18:56] you also we were in a place called I
[1:19:00] don't know whether it is called or or
[1:19:02] whatever
[1:19:03] it in
[1:19:05] Switzerland and we had wonderful
[1:19:08] meetings
[1:19:09] there we were able to be in six
[1:19:13] meetings and uh we fellowshipped with
[1:19:16] about I don't know how many pastors
[1:19:18] could be about um more than 20 about
[1:19:23] 30
[1:19:26] you know from all over the
[1:19:27] world others Came From Italy other came
[1:19:31] from you know many many areas in you
[1:19:34] know in the
[1:19:36] UK others in
[1:19:38] Germany others in you know many many
[1:19:41] places in the in the Europe in Europe
[1:19:44] but also in in the
[1:19:47] US uh there is this
[1:19:49] brother I've actually never said it
[1:19:52] publicly but I think I would say
[1:19:56] here uh one time I was in
[1:20:00] Nairobi and I had gone there for the
[1:20:03] purpose of you know of course
[1:20:05] ministering but also uh meeting a few
[1:20:10] Brothers to speak to them regarding uh
[1:20:14] my burden for
[1:20:17] Ethiopia that we had served with them in
[1:20:21] Ethiopia and specifically I desired for
[1:20:24] them to stand with
[1:20:26] us because I had this burden to go in
[1:20:29] the Northern areas of
[1:20:33] Ethiopia where there is completely no
[1:20:35] church and it's very dangerous to go
[1:20:38] to because they had recently been
[1:20:42] war and I did not know how that was
[1:20:45] going to
[1:20:46] happen I did not know how we were going
[1:20:48] to translate those messages in that
[1:20:52] language but just as soon as I had you
[1:20:54] know stepped in my hotel
[1:20:58] room I received a
[1:21:01] communication from someone I did not
[1:21:03] know and he told me you do not know
[1:21:07] me but I'm brother so and
[1:21:10] so another brother so and so gave me a
[1:21:14] contact and I have a burden for
[1:21:18] Ethiopia and he told me that you are the
[1:21:20] man to talk
[1:21:23] to the person who gave you my contact is
[1:21:26] from
[1:21:28] Zimbabwe and the brother was from the
[1:21:31] USA said I'd like to support translation
[1:21:35] in in the in
[1:21:39] Ethiopia and so I told him you don't
[1:21:42] know but I'm I'm in a place right
[1:21:45] now where I've been praying and I'm even
[1:21:48] here to meet
[1:21:50] Brothers regarding
[1:21:52] Ethiopia at that very moment
[1:21:55] God was already moving on someone from
[1:21:58] far
[1:22:00] away so for the first time we had an
[1:22:03] opportunity to meet with this
[1:22:05] brother in
[1:22:07] Switzerland now for the first time we
[1:22:09] sat down and talked about how he got the
[1:22:13] burden and he told me you know um my
[1:22:17] senior
[1:22:18] pastor you know
[1:22:20] he I was having a burden for Ethiopia
[1:22:24] and I was praying about it and then when
[1:22:27] I went to meet him he much
[1:22:29] older but he asked me what are you doing
[1:22:31] what are we doing for
[1:22:33] ethopia so you can see that God was
[1:22:36] moving on many
[1:22:39] people I tell you what if the work is of
[1:22:43] God God
[1:22:45] provides and uh and so that brother we
[1:22:48] met with him he's a wonderful

[1:24:26] surprised you know some people you know

[1:24:43] be it will be wonderful it will be
[1:24:46] wonderful let us stand on our feet just
[1:24:48] read the word of God this
[1:24:50] morning I've heard the uh the land fund
[1:24:53] contrib
[1:24:57] like to say God bless you all that are
[1:25:01] contri andly after the
[1:25:03] service I want to hold you for a few
[1:25:08] minutes so I can talk to you about that
[1:25:10] a
[1:25:12] little for now let's just go I not be so
[1:25:15] long in the word this
[1:25:17] morning so I can give time to speak to
[1:25:20] you a little bit after the
[1:25:23] service Matthew 7:
[1:25:28] 13 we are reading up to verses 14 just
[1:25:32] 13 and
[1:25:34] 14
[1:25:36] M so I'm horse this morning but I trust
[1:25:38] that uh maybe brother Dixon you need to
[1:25:40] give me a little
[1:25:44] more I think you put it down you need to
[1:25:47] put it up a little bit so
[1:25:53] that
[1:25:56] enter ye in at the Straight Gate for
[1:25:59] wide is the gate and Broad is the
[1:26:03] way that leadth to destruction and many
[1:26:06] there be which uh go in there
[1:26:22] at okay now that sounds better
[1:26:26] because straight is the gate and narrow
[1:26:28] is the way which leadth unto life and
[1:26:30] few there be that find
[1:26:39] it you may be
[1:26:44] seated I'm speaking to you on a thought
[1:26:50] of what
[1:26:53] then
[1:26:57] straight is the
[1:26:59] gate but what
[1:27:02] then and um in the scripture
[1:27:05] here Jesus Christ
[1:27:09] speaks and he
[1:27:13] says enter ye in at the Straight
[1:27:18] Gate for wide is the
[1:27:21] G and Broad is the way
[1:27:25] that lead us to
[1:27:26] destruction now we have a
[1:27:29] tendency that many people believe in
[1:27:33] things because there are many people
[1:27:34] that follow
[1:27:38] you and because many people follow
[1:27:41] something then it kind of justifies it
[1:27:43] to be
[1:27:47] true so because in your church 5,000
[1:27:50] people 10,000 people come to your
[1:27:53] church
[1:27:55] because of that you feel
[1:27:57] comfortable that you are following the
[1:28:00] truth there is a a quote that one of our
[1:28:03] sisters I think sister phbe posted on
[1:28:05] her on her
[1:28:09] group yesterday and I it really moved me
[1:28:13] and it found me you know having this
[1:28:15] Evangelistic anointing on this
[1:28:18] weekend and I loved it she said when a
[1:28:22] preacher becomes a motivational speaker
[1:28:27] the congregation
[1:28:30] [Music]
[1:28:32] becomes and I think that is true today
[1:28:35] we have more motivational speakers than
[1:28:40] preachers are we hearing what I'm saying
[1:28:43] church is not a place where we come to
[1:28:45] feel
[1:28:47] good though when we hear the word of God
[1:28:49] it makes us to feel
[1:28:52] good church is not even a place where we
[1:28:54] come to make
[1:28:56] money you know some people think that
[1:28:59] they ought not to work but they have to
[1:29:01] just go to church and pray for miracles
[1:29:02] of money
[1:29:06] every we make money in the
[1:29:09] marketplace but we come to
[1:29:12] church to come closer to
[1:29:14] God you have come here this morning
[1:29:18] because you desire to come closer to God
[1:29:21] now if you have come here for any other
[1:29:23] reason I want you to know that you are
[1:29:25] in the wrong
[1:29:26] place we come to church so that we can
[1:29:29] see how closer we can get to
[1:29:32] God not how we can build our house how
[1:29:35] we
[1:29:36] canes or how we can get married or
[1:29:39] things like that all good and it has
[1:29:42] their place in the word of
[1:29:45] God we come to church not to hear a
[1:29:48] motivational
[1:29:49] speaker we do not come here to be
[1:29:52] encouraged even
[1:29:54] we come here to be
[1:29:56] rebuked we come here to be
[1:29:58] corrected we come here to be brought
[1:30:00] closer to
[1:30:01] God now the Bible says the word of God
[1:30:04] is a two-edged
[1:30:06] SW and when it is cutting it's not only
[1:30:09] cutting you it's the
[1:30:11] pre it is even possible for a preacher
[1:30:14] to
[1:30:15] preach and at the end of the day go to
[1:30:18] hell so it's not about whether someone
[1:30:20] can preach or
[1:30:22] not you know there are many the Bible
[1:30:24] even says that we'll come to him on that
[1:30:27] day and they say Lord Lord and we do you
[1:30:30] know bring many to you in your
[1:30:32] name we heal the sick in your
[1:30:35] name we prayed for the you know we
[1:30:37] brought many
[1:30:38] solders in your name and he he did not
[1:30:42] say you did not do those
[1:30:43] things but he said go away from
[1:30:46] me and he gave the reason he said you
[1:30:49] doers of
[1:30:52] iniquity Now what is iniquity iniquity
[1:30:55] is knowing the word of
[1:30:58] God you decide to despise
[1:31:01] it and decide to put it
[1:31:03] aside and you take your
[1:31:07] understanding and you lean on your
[1:31:09] wisdom rather than leaning on the word
[1:31:11] of
[1:31:12] God but there is a a seed of God on
[1:31:16] Earth that will always hear the word and
[1:31:19] receive the
[1:31:20] word will always hear the word and be
[1:31:25] and when you hear the word you don't you
[1:31:27] don't want to put a to
[1:31:30] it when you hear the word you want to
[1:31:32] receive it
[1:31:34] wrong amen you want to receive it the
[1:31:36] way it
[1:31:37] is amen you don't want to hear the word
[1:31:39] and say I don't want
[1:31:41] that and then he walk away from the word
[1:31:45] amen how many will hear the word and
[1:31:46] receive
[1:31:48] it one
[1:31:50] accept even when the preacher is
[1:31:52] preaching the word amen he too needs to
[1:31:55] align with that
[1:31:57] word every one of us need the word of
[1:32:00] God there's no one who will outgrow the
[1:32:05] word say that me I have been preaching
[1:32:07] for so
[1:32:09] long that have come to a place where the
[1:32:12] word of God is just under
[1:32:15] me the word of God is above
[1:32:18] everyone and that's why in all the enti
[1:32:20] message churches all over the
[1:32:22] world
[1:32:24] we prioritize the
[1:32:27] word the word more than the
[1:32:31] man amen can you say Amen to that amen
[1:32:35] we believe in the word more than the
[1:32:37] man but we know it is the by the man the
[1:32:40] word
[1:32:41] comes because God cannot bypass
[1:32:45] man and then bring the word he brings
[1:32:48] the word by the word or by the voice of
[1:32:51] the
[1:32:52] man now you as a human being you need to
[1:32:56] come to a place where you look or you
[1:32:59] hear beyond the voice of the
[1:33:02] man and you hear the voice of God for
[1:33:05] you this morning you will hear either
[1:33:07] the voice of God or the word of
[1:33:11] God my the word of
[1:33:15] God I don't know about you but I want to
[1:33:17] hear the
[1:33:20] voice and he says Jesus said enter ye in
[1:33:23] a the St
[1:33:26] for white is the gate and Broad is the
[1:33:29] way so many people always go where the
[1:33:32] majority
[1:33:34] go and you know but it is the opposite
[1:33:37] with
[1:33:38] God it is the opposite with God every
[1:33:42] time you have the
[1:33:44] majority more of them are
[1:33:49] nonbelievers no more of them most of
[1:33:52] them are
[1:33:52] usually
[1:33:54] and our Prophet told us that there are
[1:33:57] three kinds of
[1:33:59] believer the first category is the real
[1:34:03] Believers the second is the me
[1:34:07] Believers the third are the
[1:34:10] nonbeliever and they are all in the same
[1:34:12] Church of Jesus
[1:34:14] Christ they will always be
[1:34:16] there they will always be there the real
[1:34:20] believer and the make
[1:34:22] believer you see the difference is the
[1:34:25] real believer will hear the
[1:34:27] word and accept the word be convicted by
[1:34:31] the word be changed by the word before
[1:34:34] they get changed they will grown within
[1:34:37] themselves they will yearn to be like
[1:34:39] the
[1:34:40] wife the unbeliever the
[1:34:44] believer behave as if they
[1:34:47] believe we try to even leave like the
[1:34:51] word deep in their heart no seed of God
[1:34:55] in
[1:34:56] there take that word and believe that
[1:34:59] word and so we see like
[1:35:02] Kan did not have that se gen of God
[1:35:05] in you know he even tried to be to hear
[1:35:08] what God was
[1:35:09] saying but he did not really hear it he
[1:35:13] did not really accept it can you imagine
[1:35:16] God came down to
[1:35:17] hear and he said Kan if you do
[1:35:20] good you be accepted
[1:35:24] but what did Kan
[1:35:25] answer Kan behaved as if he
[1:35:29] answered but he turned around and he
[1:35:32] went and killed his that mother
[1:35:35] spirit that spirit that a kills your
[1:35:39] brother did you know that even to speak
[1:35:41] against your
[1:35:43] brother speak against your sister you
[1:35:46] are murdering them how many knew that
[1:35:50] how many knew that you did not know that
[1:35:53] you speak against somebody your brother
[1:35:57] you are killing that and we see that
[1:36:00] Cain mured his brother and he turned
[1:36:04] around and he came back in the
[1:36:06] church and he sat down and when God was
[1:36:09] preaching was saying
[1:36:10] amen but that day his godness had
[1:36:14] fallen he said where is your brother My
[1:36:17] Brother's
[1:36:19] Keeper my own man and I minding my own
[1:36:22] business let me tell you the way of God
[1:36:27] when you are walking in it you will have
[1:36:30] a Gentle
[1:36:31] Spirit you have a spirit that loves
[1:36:35] others so many people want to go where
[1:36:37] the majority
[1:36:39] go and it's not easy to follow after the
[1:36:41] narrow
[1:36:43] way usually the way that is
[1:36:46] right is followed by a
[1:36:49] few usually the truth is believed by a
[1:36:52] few
[1:36:54] usually the majority are always
[1:36:57] wrong I know sometimes there are certain
[1:36:59] times we make a vote in the
[1:37:01] church but I'll tell you something
[1:37:04] brother usually the majority are always
[1:37:08] wrong the minority are always
[1:37:11] right because why God works in the
[1:37:16] minority I prove that in just a moment
[1:37:19] we find that in the Bible when the 12
[1:37:22] disciple you you know Judas betro
[1:37:26] Jesus you know he he he told him you
[1:37:29] know when you know he died and the
[1:37:32] disciples came together and they said
[1:37:35] let us choose among
[1:37:38] ourselves another
[1:37:40] disciple I'm sure they must have looked
[1:37:42] for somebody who was closer to
[1:37:45] them closer to their
[1:37:47] [Music]
[1:37:48] thinking the understanding of closer to
[1:37:52] everything but what do you see that he
[1:37:54] did
[1:37:56] Maus did you even know that that was his
[1:38:01] name some of you didn't even know his
[1:38:04] but you know he did not do so
[1:38:06] much but what did God do chose
[1:38:10] Paul and Paul was amen could not be
[1:38:13] chosen
[1:38:15] by he could not even when God chose him
[1:38:19] and he sent him to go and be
[1:38:21] baptized you know he feared to go
[1:38:24] he said what if they kill me who was
[1:38:27] going to kill you who was he afraid of
[1:38:30] the soal
[1:38:32] believer the so people who are following
[1:38:35] God they were the ones who could not
[1:38:38] choose
[1:38:40] him and when you feel like you are the
[1:38:43] worst of the worst then you always the
[1:38:47] choice of
[1:38:48] God because God came for the
[1:38:51] work God came for the sinners
[1:38:54] praise the name of the Lord and so he
[1:38:56] went to the
[1:38:57] disciples and he feared even to go among
[1:39:00] them even went and stayed with them for
[1:39:02] just
[1:39:03] while and then he left and he went to
[1:39:07] the
[1:39:09] desert
[1:39:10] alone and he he swe it out CRI it out it
[1:39:15] out until God moved with there's
[1:39:18] something I'm trying to bring to you
[1:39:20] that if you're going to make a decision
[1:39:23] to follow Jesus Christ you have to
[1:39:25] accept to be in the
[1:39:28] minority it's not always easy to follow
[1:39:32] the narrow way it's necessar leaving
[1:39:34] things
[1:39:36] behind it makes you
[1:39:39] unud the will of God is always
[1:39:44] difficult everybody will disagree with
[1:39:47] you even in the decisions you make in
[1:39:49] your own private
[1:39:51] life you many times you realize when it
[1:39:54] is the will of
[1:39:56] God not many will agree with
[1:39:58] you but always this is the way of
[1:40:04] life a prophet in the message audible
[1:40:06] says I now see you become an
[1:40:10] audible sure enough to the world but I
[1:40:13] don't let that bother
[1:40:15] you don't let that bother you now you
[1:40:18] say how do I know I am threaded
[1:40:22] right the word now you know whether you
[1:40:25] are threaded
[1:40:27] right whether we are nuts for
[1:40:31] Christ or whether we are the nuts nuts
[1:40:33] for the
[1:40:34] world I don't know whether you want to
[1:40:36] call that nutty find better
[1:40:43] word
[1:40:46] yes okay fine whatever you want to say
[1:40:50] whether you are an old boy whether you a
[1:40:52] foolish man
[1:40:54] for Christ foolish man for the world you
[1:40:57] see friend you that is listening to me
[1:41:00] this morning I want you to understand
[1:41:03] that you cannot live in this
[1:41:06] world the way just you yourself being
[1:41:11] led by
[1:41:16] nothing that nobody leads
[1:41:19] them nobody guides them they still
[1:41:23] Guided by that
[1:41:25] spirit that makes them believe
[1:41:28] that you you are either led by
[1:41:32] Christ or you are led by the world
[1:41:36] spirit that is in the
[1:41:37] world and if you are led by the spirit
[1:41:40] of
[1:41:41] God you will bow to this
[1:41:44] world if you are led by the spirit of
[1:41:46] the
[1:41:48] world you will bow to the things of the
[1:41:51] world whose servant are you are you
[1:41:54] serving Christ the word or you are
[1:41:57] serving the
[1:41:58] world many people always want Mix
[1:42:03] us God always is looking for
[1:42:07] separator I realize when I believe the
[1:42:09] message in the
[1:42:11] beginning I had to make deliberate
[1:42:15] moves separate
[1:42:17] myself from some of the things that I
[1:42:19] love so
[1:42:22] dear there's one thing that I really
[1:42:25] love and that was my
[1:42:28] Bishop because you see he was a real
[1:42:30] good man and and you know he helped me
[1:42:33] in life and he did so much for me but
[1:42:36] you see the things he believed it was
[1:42:39] against the word of
[1:42:40] God Amen and the Bible says in the
[1:42:43] year that died I saw the
[1:42:49] Lord who is
[1:42:51] your mine was that but
[1:42:54] who what is it that is so big that you
[1:42:56] feel you cannot separate
[1:43:00] from what is it there is much more than
[1:43:04] you
[1:43:05] think you need to separate

[1:53:07] difficult especially when you are
[1:53:10] younger and having to live in a
[1:53:13] community where everybody doesn't see
[1:53:15] things the way you
[1:53:17] see and they begin to look you at you
[1:53:20] different they begin to look at you an
[1:53:23] audible they begin to look at you as a
[1:53:25] foolish person as somebody who is beside
[1:53:29] himself someone who who is
[1:53:32] brainwashed someone who has lost their
[1:53:35] mind but friend if you not ready to Amen
[1:53:38] to appear like that to
[1:53:41] them then you are ashamed of
[1:53:44] Christ amen but I want to be amen like
[1:53:48] what was written in the
[1:53:50] Bible said I am not ashamed I am not
[1:53:55] ashamed Paul wrot to
[1:53:58] Romans I am not ashamed of the Gospel I
[1:54:03] am not ashamed how many here can say the
[1:54:06] same I am not ashamed of the goel I am
[1:54:09] not ashamed of the Gospel tell two
[1:54:12] people I am not ashamed of the
[1:54:14] goel I am not ashamed of the
[1:54:17] gopel what is the gospel it is the power
[1:54:20] of God to
[1:54:23] Salvation amen amen the
[1:54:26] Greek Jew the UG and ethopians to all
[1:54:32] that believe the gopel the word is the
[1:54:37] power am not ashamed to identify myself
[1:54:41] with the
[1:54:42] believer Hallelujah if everyone at your
[1:54:46] workplace dress as a
[1:54:49] minister makes up and paints their lips
[1:54:53] put their earrings don't be ashamed to
[1:54:57] say I don't believe in
[1:54:59] that they ask you why don't you do that
[1:55:03] some of you you can't even
[1:55:05] testify that they will even bring you a
[1:55:09] gift makeup
[1:55:12] kit because they think you don't have
[1:55:14] the money to
[1:55:15] buy and that's why you're not using it
[1:55:19] oh what a shame let me tell you must be
[1:55:22] able to stand and this is what I
[1:55:26] believe so that everybody will know you
[1:55:30] have a
[1:55:31] stand let me tell you we in a
[1:55:33] generation that is losing the
[1:55:37] backbone whereby people are fearing to
[1:55:39] stand for what they
[1:55:44] believe don't fear to stand for what you
[1:55:48] believe everybody is
[1:55:50] fearful don't be
[1:55:53] careful if you don't believe in
[1:55:55] fornication you don't believe in
[1:55:57] for if they begin to talk about and
[1:56:00] laugh at
[1:56:03] people and they laugh at them and then I
[1:56:07] can't say any word here because if I
[1:56:10] do I will be an
[1:56:13] audible what a shame you have to be
[1:56:16] ready to be
[1:56:19] an you have to be ready then usually
[1:56:22] people who
[1:56:23] say I can't
[1:56:26] judge I can't be a
[1:56:28] judge such people are also
[1:56:34] victims are you hearing me they victims
[1:56:38] they are silent
[1:56:39] victims so they a part of what is going
[1:56:43] on that's why they can't judge but the
[1:56:46] Bible tells us we shall judge even the
[1:56:50] angels and how much more the small
[1:56:52] things and small matters in our
[1:56:55] M we cannot judge those who are
[1:56:59] without but we can judge those who are
[1:57:03] within the ones who are without we are
[1:57:06] sent to be
[1:57:09] Witnesses so why does God want why does
[1:57:11] God separate
[1:57:13] us so he can make us ready for the
[1:57:16] Rapture he is separating us so that he
[1:57:20] can prepare a church without spot
[1:57:22] without
[1:57:24] wrinkle so he can M his character in
[1:57:28] us oh friend amen God wants to make you
[1:57:33] special God wants to mold you God wants
[1:57:36] to work on you and he wants to remove
[1:57:39] you from the
[1:57:40] crowd and set you aside so he can begin
[1:57:44] to work on
[1:57:46] you accept being
[1:57:49] separated if you are not separated
[1:57:53] how then can he work
[1:57:56] on you know I have several
[1:57:59] children and so when I have something
[1:58:02] special I want to give to one of
[1:58:07] them tell to one of
[1:58:09] them I will not tell it to them when
[1:58:13] everybody else is
[1:58:16] there I'll just come and pick them out
[1:58:20] of The
[1:58:21] Crow
[1:58:23] and take them in the
[1:58:27] bedroom and now my other children are
[1:58:29] usually
[1:58:31] wife so when they realize one of them is
[1:58:34] missing they run to find where they
[1:58:37] are because they are
[1:58:40] suspicious might be
[1:58:43] [Music]
[1:58:45] giving and they always
[1:58:48] right so if for example I picked one
[1:58:54] and then came and she finds the things
[1:58:57] is already
[1:58:59] done she will
[1:59:01] tough and ask the sister what did he
[1:59:04] tell you what did
[1:59:07] tell because she didn't want to
[1:59:10] miss let me tell you friends this is how
[1:59:14] God does
[1:59:15] for he he he he wants to pick us from
[1:59:18] the
[1:59:19] crowd because we are special
[1:59:24] he picks us out of the
[1:59:26] crowd because he loves us and he takes
[1:59:29] us in a
[1:59:30] place he begin to tell us
[1:59:33] Secrets things thats know nothing
[1:59:36] about he went when he was on Earth and
[1:59:39] he spoke to the people and he told them
[1:59:42] things everybody had
[1:59:44] Parables he went to the own his own he
[1:59:48] picked them out he took them in the
[1:59:50] secret room and began telling them the
[1:59:53] explanation of the
[1:59:55] parable Hallelujah until one day Peter
[2:00:00] came realized Jesus had what we call
[2:00:04] here
[2:00:08] socialism God and he told Jesus today I
[2:00:12] want you to tell me why do you always
[2:00:16] separate and you separate us from the
[2:00:20] others tell us deeper
[2:00:24] things why do you always tell us why do
[2:00:27] you always tell us not
[2:00:31] themus I believe he was so happy
[2:00:34] with Hallelujah and he said to him
[2:00:37] because to them it is not
[2:00:41] given all the
[2:00:43] Mysteries all the
[2:00:45] Mysteries to you it is given to know the
[2:00:49] mysteries of the kingdom of God
[2:00:53] because we are the bride because we the
[2:00:55] seed of God us we are given to
[2:00:59] know Mysteries of the world but to the
[2:01:02] world they are not given to know don't
[2:01:06] Marvel God separates you
[2:01:11] [Music]
[2:01:13] from want to give you
[2:01:15] Revelation he wants to amen hallelujah
[2:01:18] hallelujah he wants to lift you in a
[2:01:20] place say I am seated with him in
[2:01:24] Heavenly places how can you be seated
[2:01:27] with him you are seated with the world
[2:01:30] it cannot be you have to be seated with
[2:01:33] him after separating
[2:01:36] yourself from the world when the world
[2:01:39] begin
[2:01:41] jokes walk away from that kind offf
[2:01:44] don't join them in
[2:01:46] their because you are
[2:01:49] different you are special you are not
[2:01:52] like the world you are a child of
[2:01:57] God hallelujah Ephesians 5 that he might
[2:02:03] sanctify and the washing of
[2:02:08] the that he might present it to
[2:02:12] himself a glorious
[2:02:14] Church Oh Glory God he wants you to be a

[2:02:30] not having
[2:02:31] sport not having wrinkles or any such
[2:02:36] thing that it should be
[2:02:38] holy and without
[2:02:40] blish us to be
[2:02:43] separated the Old Testament he separated
[2:02:46] two
[2:02:47] tribes two groups of people amen they
[2:02:51] were special
[2:02:52] they were called special they were
[2:02:55] anointed
[2:02:56] special one of them was Kings they were
[2:03:00] supposed to be
[2:03:01] rulers oh are you hearing me this
[2:03:04] morning and the other were are priests
[2:03:08] there were supposed to be servants in
[2:03:09] the temple
[2:03:12] to and now in the New Testament we have
[2:03:16] said for us Believers in Jesus Christ we
[2:03:20] are both Kings
[2:03:23] PR in other words we are supposed to be
[2:03:26] rulers supposed to rule over sin we
[2:03:30] supposed to rule over our
[2:03:32] Temptation we supposed to rule over the
[2:03:34] world the world is supposed to be below
[2:03:38] us and we are supposed to be on top of
[2:03:40] it we will be tempted like them but we
[2:03:44] shall rule over that
[2:03:46] temp we will be drawn into the things
[2:03:48] like
[2:03:49] them we shall overcome
[2:03:53] why because we are
[2:03:56] king and then he also says we are
[2:04:00] priest holy holy unto the Lord we going
[2:04:04] to manifest that
[2:04:06] Holiness the Holiness of the
[2:04:08] word it's not going to be a law it's
[2:04:12] going to be the life of Jesus
[2:04:14] Christ Living in us and so that's why he
[2:04:17] wants us to be
[2:04:19] separated and separated
[2:04:23] so Genesis 12 let me show you an example
[2:04:27] here verse 1 to
[2:04:32] 5 and I told you I won't be so long this
[2:04:35] morning so I'll finish in a few
[2:04:38] moments so you better enjoy the word
[2:04:40] while it
[2:04:42] lasts now the Lord had said unto Abraham
[2:04:45] get thee out of thy country and from thy
[2:04:47] Kindred and from thy Father's House unto
[2:04:50] a land that I will show thee
[2:04:52] this is verse
[2:04:55] [Music]
[2:05:01] [Music]
[2:05:04] 11 and I will make of thee a great
[2:05:07] nation and I bless thee and make thy
[2:05:09] name great and thou shalt be a
[2:05:18] blessing praise the name of the Lord and
[2:05:21] I bless them that bless
[2:05:24] thee and C him that c
[2:05:26] thee and in thee shall all the families
[2:05:29] of the earth be
[2:05:32] blessed so Abraham departed as the Lord
[2:05:35] had spoken unto
[2:05:37] him and went with him Abraham was 7
[2:05:42] years old when he departed out of
[2:05:46] her and Abraham took SAR his
[2:05:50] wife his brother's son and all their
[2:05:53] substance that they had
[2:05:56] gathered and saw that they had gotten in
[2:05:58] Haron and they went forth to go in the
[2:06:00] land of
[2:06:02] Canan the land of Canan they
[2:06:05] came now before we continue here to read
[2:06:08] this other qu that I have
[2:06:11] here let us go through a little bit of
[2:06:13] this scripture he says the Lord said un
[2:06:16] AB get thee out of thy
[2:06:19] country and out of
[2:06:22] kind and from thy Father's
[2:06:25] House praise God did you see those three
[2:06:29] things we all need to go through
[2:06:32] them one get out of your
[2:06:36] country all right which country are we
[2:06:39] from
[2:06:41] Uganda so we do things like
[2:06:45] Uganda get out of your
[2:06:47] country if your country is get out of
[2:06:49] your
[2:06:50] country
[2:06:52] it doesn't matter what your country is
[2:06:54] get out of your
[2:06:56] country and it's good to be to love your
[2:07:00] country Naturally Speaking humanly
[2:07:03] speaking I'm one person who really loves
[2:07:07] ug I even Marvel at people who live
[2:07:09] Uganda to go and live in other
[2:07:13] countries because when you go to those
[2:07:14] countries you don't see anything that
[2:07:17] they have that is better than Uganda in
[2:07:19] the sense that it will make you leave
[2:07:20] Uganda to stay
[2:07:25] [Music]
[2:07:29] people say
[2:07:30] money but then what is money you can
[2:07:33] make money anywhere
[2:07:35] you I believe if you are blessed by God
[2:07:39] doesn't matter where you are you can
[2:07:41] make
[2:07:42] money those who believe that say
[2:07:45] amen and quite frankly I will say I've
[2:07:48] not seen a country as beautiful as
[2:07:50] you
[2:07:52] and I'm
[2:07:54] honest you all the countries have been
[2:07:57] to so far Uganda is the
[2:08:01] most and you know by the time the
[2:08:03] prophet
[2:08:04] died wanted to come to
[2:08:07] Uganda and I know he spoke very well
[2:08:09] about
[2:08:10] Canada and you know about you know the
[2:08:13] the you know the mountains and green and
[2:08:17] you know the trees everything how he
[2:08:19] hunted there many times
[2:08:22] but I think he had not come to
[2:08:25] Uganda he had come to Uganda would have
[2:08:27] loved
[2:08:30] Uganda Uganda is beautiful I this
[2:08:33] weather is
[2:08:34] beautiful when when you are here it can
[2:08:37] be
[2:08:39] hot but not so
[2:08:41] hot it can be
[2:08:44] cold mean Uganda is the best you know
[2:08:47] has the best
[2:08:49] WEA that I have seen know debate with
[2:08:52] brother Prince on that you thought but
[2:08:55] but you know Uganda has the best
[2:08:59] weather and so you talk about UGA many
[2:09:03] things you can talk
[2:09:04] about you talk about the food you know
[2:09:08] we have organic
[2:09:09] food SP with all these you know
[2:09:12] artificial
[2:09:13] things you talk about the people I think
[2:09:16] there are good people here and land and
[2:09:19] everything you know but above all those
[2:09:23] things now he's saying you have to leave
[2:09:25] your
[2:09:26] country because the prophet said that
[2:09:28] every every country has its own
[2:09:31] spirit so you go to every country you'll
[2:09:34] see that they have a spirit
[2:09:36] about you know and and and you know if
[2:09:39] you don't if you
[2:09:41] misunderstand you think they mean to be
[2:09:44] bad but their nature their Spirit the
[2:09:46] spirit of their
[2:09:48] country you know people have come here
[2:09:50] and have committed about ug
[2:09:53] here you know it's because the speed of
[2:09:56] the
[2:09:56] country whenever Kenyans come here they
[2:10:00] have a tendency of saying ugand a little
[2:10:02] bit
[2:10:03] slow and when we go there we always say
[2:10:06] you're so fast Russ because in
[2:10:10] Kenya somebody lives in
[2:10:13] Nairobi you cannot get a of them they're
[2:10:17] just so
[2:10:20] busy very
[2:10:22] busy even when some of them are doing
[2:10:24] nothing they
[2:10:26] just and here in Uganda even when
[2:10:29] someone is supposed to be doing a
[2:10:32] lot they just take their
[2:10:35] time they always
[2:10:37] slowful sometimes I get sick
[2:10:40] of because why why is someone
[2:10:44] slow the spirit of the
[2:10:47] country when it rains in
[2:10:49] Uganda people don't go to
[2:10:52] church I can see didn't come here
[2:10:54] because it looked like it would
[2:10:58] rain just look like it would
[2:11:03] rain and they they didn't come to chch
[2:11:06] in the spe of the country you know but
[2:11:09] in Nairobi whether it RS or not you find
[2:11:13] people
[2:11:14] walking very early in the
[2:11:17] morning going to work Spirit of the
[2:11:20] country
[2:11:22] in
[2:11:23] China almost God is
[2:11:26] money you know many people have told me
[2:11:28] we believe I believe in
[2:11:31] myself you can talk with them if you're
[2:11:33] talking
[2:11:35] money if you're talking
[2:11:38] business
[2:11:41] things even then in that country and in
[2:11:45] this country and in Kenya and in every
[2:11:48] country there are
[2:11:50] believers
[2:11:52] have
[2:11:52] accepted to leave their
[2:11:55] country
[2:11:58] hallelujah praise God you find in in you
[2:12:03] know first you know like Canada
[2:12:06] Europe they don't believe in having a
[2:12:09] lot of
[2:12:11] children many die without even having a
[2:12:20] child have time
[2:12:22] for and then if they have maybe one
[2:12:26] child but you see the Believers of this
[2:12:30] message they have
[2:12:33] children some of them even pray for God
[2:12:36] to give them a child when they can't
[2:12:39] have a child and I actually met one
[2:12:42] brother
[2:12:43] name he told me have a child but he
[2:12:47] prayed it's a long story but very
[2:12:49] powerful testimony prayed and God gave
[2:12:52] him a child and he showed me that child
[2:12:55] she's a beautiful young lady and I tell
[2:12:58] you what God is into the business of
[2:13:02] providing
[2:13:03] Miracles if you in need of one you one
[2:13:07] this
[2:13:08] morning hallelujah amen amen so if you
[2:13:12] leave your
[2:13:13] country if in your country if they
[2:13:16] corrupt you don't have to be corrupt
[2:13:20] like know in
[2:13:23] Uganda well the Bible tells you to leave
[2:13:26] your
[2:13:28] country if someone says come on you
[2:13:30] don't know how they do it
[2:13:33] here I'm not from
[2:13:35] here I'm from
[2:13:37] above Hallelujah there are some
[2:13:41] institutions where they don't
[2:13:43] institutions
[2:13:45] organizations whereby they don't ask you
[2:13:47] for Bri
[2:13:49] directly they just tell you behave like
[2:13:52] a
[2:13:54] ug
[2:13:59] ug they trying to say things move
[2:14:04] with you know a police off stops you and
[2:14:07] he how are
[2:14:17] you and you know I always say no I'm
[2:14:20] sorry I'm not
[2:14:22] where are you from I'm from
[2:14:25] above
[2:14:28] Hallelujah you realize your language is
[2:14:31] different so if you're ugan you can't
[2:14:34] you will speak Ugandan
[2:14:36] language you from above you can't speak
[2:14:39] the same language with
[2:14:41] them and God told
[2:14:44] Abraham Abraham leave your
[2:14:46] country Hallelujah and he also told him
[2:14:49] leave your kind
[2:14:52] oh my God some people love their
[2:15:01] [Music]
[2:15:07] kind
[2:15:09] am don't play with me don't with
[2:15:17] me you they would speak me I'm a lure
[2:15:29] we are from
[2:15:31] above because we are been
[2:15:33] told leave your
[2:15:36] kind go beyond the
[2:15:39] C go beyond the C your desire should be
[2:15:43] different we are Christians we are
[2:15:46] children of God we are not of Our Own

[2:15:58] Hallelujah
[2:15:59] Hallelujah Hallelujah
[2:16:02] Hallelujah in
[2:16:04] Europe there is something I saw
[2:16:07] there I know this is public somebody
[2:16:09] could see no
[2:16:11] problem truth I saw a lot of racism
[2:16:16] there from a lot of you know restes
[2:16:19] different rest and things
[2:16:22] but among the Believers you could meet
[2:16:26] somebody and you just see there like a
[2:16:30] baby and then they just give you that
[2:16:33] big warm
[2:16:35] heart God bless
[2:16:37] you
[2:16:39] mean they have left their
[2:16:42] kind they have left their
[2:16:44] kind they have gone beyond the
[2:16:47] C we do need to go beyond the car we
[2:16:51] need to stop thinking like
[2:16:54] Thea and that's why we have a problem
[2:16:58] even in
[2:16:59] marriages we have a big problem people
[2:17:02] don't let go of their
[2:17:05] traditions and someone ask me past
[2:17:07] Traditions
[2:17:08] wrong I said Traditions are not
[2:17:11] wrong where they contradict with the
[2:17:15] word they become
[2:17:17] wrong because we must not bow to
[2:17:20] traditions of
[2:17:23] as long as they contradict with the
[2:17:24] tradition of
[2:17:26] the praise the name of the
[2:17:29] Lord my my my well I know there are
[2:17:32] people who go
[2:17:34] overboard I want
[2:17:37] we because I'm very
[2:17:43] spiritual praise God so we need to be
[2:17:46] balanced

[2:28:36] depart with your
[2:28:37] habit oh God help
[2:28:39] us listen to what he says down here then
[2:28:43] when
[2:28:45] Abraham's
[2:28:49] Lord
[2:28:50] with each
[2:28:51] other lot was already
[2:28:56] backing in his heart and he went toward
[2:29:00] Sodom and you know the end of
[2:29:02] him Abram as soon as he had done what
[2:29:06] God told him to
[2:29:08] do separate
[2:29:10] himself from his kind and
[2:29:13] everything now you say what about
[2:29:15] Sarah and sah are
[2:29:18] one you and your wife are one
[2:29:21] I don't want you to hear I don't want to
[2:29:22] hear people saying I departed
[2:29:27] Pastor from your
[2:29:28] wife don't depart from your wife don't
[2:29:32] depart from your husband you and your
[2:29:34] wife are one but now Sarah was in the
[2:29:37] Covenant with
[2:29:38] him because she was the wife but notice
[2:29:43] when he separated
[2:29:45] himself amen from Lord and Lord's
[2:29:48] wife I imagine Mrs
[2:29:50] Lord wanted to belong to all the
[2:29:54] lotteries and everything going along
[2:29:56] through the
[2:29:58] country so she was a Hance to
[2:30:02] [Music]
[2:30:03] him and the Bible said let us
[2:30:07] lay
[2:30:09] every
[2:30:12] that when we in this let us lay
[2:30:16] aside lay aside
[2:30:18] every
[2:30:20] lay aside every
[2:30:22] way don't accept to carry a w you're not
[2:30:25] supposed to
[2:30:27] car lay aside every way lay aside the
[2:30:31] malice lay aside the L lay
[2:30:35] aside L aside immorality aside
[2:30:40] everything and let us run with
[2:30:42] patience the that is set before
[2:30:45] [Music]
[2:30:46] us looking unto Jesus our
[2:30:52] notice when he got separated from
[2:30:55] Lord what did God appear to him then
[2:31:00] again after he separated
[2:31:03] himself and done what God told him to
[2:31:06] do then God come to
[2:31:08] him and when God tells you to do
[2:31:12] anything you would better go and do
[2:31:15] it or you might not see him no more for
[2:31:18] a
[2:31:18] while
[2:31:21] do what God tells you
[2:31:22] to that's your next move
[2:31:25] is it's your next
[2:31:28] move to obey
[2:31:32] goded is better than
[2:31:35] sacrifice then when he got himself
[2:31:37] separated from
[2:31:39] Lord then God appear to
[2:31:41] him and said Abraham you made a nice
[2:31:46] choice you you you told Lord to take his
[2:31:51] choice and Lord went down towards

[2:34:45] easy like you are going to live here
[2:34:48] forever
[2:34:50] you are not none of us is going to live

[2:36:00] brother your
[2:36:02] soul as it was with
[2:36:05] prayer and say Lord Jesus check up on me
[2:36:10] let me take inventory
[2:36:11] tonight before I go to bed and find out
[2:36:15] what's the matter with
[2:36:17] me I've been professing for years
[2:36:20] and I don't see these things that Jesus
[2:36:24] say that he would be with me and things
[2:36:28] would go on I don't
[2:36:30] say what's the matter Lord Jesus listen
[2:36:34] be
[2:36:37] honest come down and talk to
[2:36:42] him as face to face with a
[2:36:46] brother by the way the problem we have
[2:36:48] with this generation
[2:36:51] is people are no longer
[2:36:54] sincere and that's a big
[2:36:56] problem you see when in the Bible when
[2:37:00] men of God
[2:37:03] sinned they
[2:37:09] F they put that thing
[2:37:13] right they never came again before the
[2:37:16] presence
[2:37:18] of but we have
[2:37:20] generation that doesn't care we leave
[2:37:23] any
[2:37:25] do and they still call
[2:37:28] themselves but he says be sincere come
[2:37:30] down and talk to
[2:37:32] him face to face as face to face with
[2:37:36] a he will reveal to you he will tell you
[2:37:40] tear your soul
[2:37:42] apart and you will lay it out there say
[2:37:46] Lord Jesus if it cost me my f
[2:37:50] if it cost me my life if it cost me my
[2:37:53] job if it cost me my
[2:37:56] membership if it cost my prestig in the
[2:37:59] city I will take the way with the Lord
[2:38:04] is now remember Jesus said straight is
[2:38:07] the
[2:38:08] gate and narrow is the way and few there
[2:38:13] be for broad is the way that leads to
[2:38:17] destruction a Millions more now
[2:38:21] 2024 is the G that
[2:38:24] lead and many
[2:38:27] be find it that's right he that will
[2:38:31] lose his life for my
[2:38:33] sake shall find it he that loves his
[2:38:37] father mother father brother anything
[2:38:41] better than me is not worth
[2:38:45] it he will put his hand on a plow and
[2:38:47] start forward even turn to look back is
[2:38:50] not worthy of the

[2:42:11] is the prophet of God says it's up to
[2:42:18] you sometimes I've come up here and
[2:42:20] preached
[2:42:22] sermons and I've always tried to preach
[2:42:27] Inspirations and I never want to preach
[2:42:32] situations and sometimes I even ask
[2:42:35] myself Lord why did you inspire me to
[2:42:41] preach and there are times that I feel
[2:42:43] so bad after the
[2:42:45] [Music]
[2:42:46] service oh God I think i' read that
[2:42:48] service
[2:42:50] [Music]

[2:42:58] stram and that was for
[2:43:01] me I never forget one day when you know
