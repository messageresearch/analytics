[9:30] lo Sarah thou wife shall have a son and
[9:33] Sarah heard it in the tent door which

[11:46] strong for the message of the hour
[11:52] so the coming of the Lord Jesus there's
[11:54] some common to send Jesus months before
[11:57] breasts away and one night before Buddha

[12:14] seven times greetings and blessings
[12:18] I just read through your very Noble
[12:20] defense of the true message of the hour

[12:37] with you

[12:43] like
[12:44] I have cried out for the balance in the
[12:48] message
[12:55] he signed it off George Martin
[12:59] I believe that it was his testimony
[13:02] he loved the Lord Jesus
[13:05] and he served him with all his heart on
[13:08] him he was invited to be here today
[13:12] I wasn't able to come God had a greater
[13:16] plan for him
[13:18] amen but my son Timothy has been able to
[13:21] come to be with me elements on Timothy
[13:23] isn't to come with me and he's my hero
[13:26] and that's mine Health
[13:28] amen not for me this is 53 years of
[13:31] ministry
[13:35] I started preaching this message when I
[13:38] was 15 years old
[13:43] I was born again in this message
[13:47] never preached any other message
[13:50] if you wonder what I'm preaching now
[13:54] I still preach the same glorious message
[14:10] it's just wonderful to be with my
[14:12] Believers today
[14:15] amen I'd look over and see so many
[14:18] friends for the years that I've known
[14:20] foreign
[15:23] so good care of me she was like a mother
[15:26] to me inside of oh it's so good for me
[15:28] thank you thank God Amen God bless you
[15:31] let's see it's so great to be with you
[15:34] and so it is
[15:44] now in these Services
[15:47] I might refer to brother Brandon's book
[15:49] on the exposition of the seven churches
[15:56] you see I was there in 1965.
[16:01] when the first release of the books were
[16:04] brought to the Life Tabernacle in
[16:06] Shreveport that's the Aston house
[16:12] and brother Branham introduced the
[16:14] church age book in the Shreveport
[16:15] meetings
[16:20] he's saying my book is just out on the
[16:23] seven Church ages
[16:26] and I think we have a thousand copies
[16:29] here right now
[16:32] we were there at that meeting and we
[16:35] received the first copies of the
[16:37] churches book we have on daughter
[16:42] and he explained in the Shreveport
[16:44] meetings about his books
[16:48] he said you have all seen in my book
[16:51] well now I can say
[16:53] it'll all be drawn out in the seven
[16:55] churches
[17:00] which he told me which I stand by as a
[17:04] witness to God to be judged in the day
[17:06] of judgment for it
[17:13] um
[17:15] it come from God not my own thinking
[17:18] it's come from God
[17:20] amen amen so it's a book that should be
[17:23] accepted by all believers
[17:28] that's why we refer to it on this
[17:31] opportunity because we believe the
[17:34] truths that are established in that
[17:36] message
[17:39] now we have read it in the Book of
[17:41] Genesis
[17:44] of a prophecy or a type of the last day
[17:48] foreign
[17:50] tube of the legend talk where the word
[17:53] that God appeared unto Abraham and to
[17:56] Sarah as God as Sheen Abram and he asked
[17:59] the question where is Sarah thy wife on
[18:01] The Factory voice
[18:06] and I he said I will certainly return to
[18:10] you according to the time of life
[18:15] shall have a son
[18:18] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[18:21] which was behind him
[18:24] now hear him lies a prophecy of the last
[18:28] day so here in league and the prophetic
[18:30] as God would come to bring to her to her
[18:34] a message of restoration does God is
[18:39] what I want to speak on today is the
[18:42] message of restorations
[18:45] you see it was like it was in the days
[18:49] of lot is it
[19:03] it's a day when men don't want truth but
[19:07] they want to feel good religion they
[19:09] have disciples
[19:13] however they please and then live
[19:16] however they please
[19:19] but in a day like that
[19:22] Abraham and Sarah
[19:25] foreign
[19:30] and with that visitation comes an open
[19:34] book of inheritance
[19:39] that would identify Sarah in the promise
[19:44] [Music]
[19:46] you see the book is the title to
[19:49] everything that was lost
[19:54] it contains our entrance by a Rapture
[19:58] into the heavens where Adam wants ruled
[20:00] from you understand
[20:03] so foreign
[20:21] the Revelation chapter 10.
[20:27] of the mighty Angel where Christ himself
[20:31] comes down with the open books
[20:37] black bride in this last day so the
[20:39] hours of it brought him let's talk it is
[20:42] it is an open book identifying Us in the
[20:45] promise assistant
[20:48] and this is the crescendo
[20:52] it is the ultimate of all the
[20:54] outpourings of the god spirit this is
[20:59] in Abraham's day in Abraham's Park when
[21:02] the angel of the Lord showed upon the
[21:05] Earth at the end of the sound a Sheen of
[21:07] the earth it was a declaration that the
[21:10] promise of God was about to be fulfilled
[21:16] this sets us apart from the church at
[21:18] Pentecost in Acts 2.
[21:23] a deposit was given to the church
[21:28] but this time the spirit comes but Jesus
[21:32] Malcolm to a guy and is poured out to
[21:34] bring the bride into her full and
[21:36] complete inheritance
[21:44] but don't try to do away with the
[21:47] deposit about the Communist president
[21:52] hiding guys
[21:58] the book of the title deed is for you
[22:05] but without it
[22:06] about all of these the book is not yours
[22:09] is
[22:10] now brother Branham tells us I'm trying
[22:12] to do God of service the
[22:22] understand
[22:29] [Music]
[23:20] to an individual to do so Dennis
[23:26] it can't come to a group it never did
[23:33] that's what God promised in the shadows
[23:36] of the coming for his bride and Eliza
[23:39] and that's not God for heist and then
[23:41] shut in this comments for the brought
[23:43] and elieza so the message of restoration
[23:46] is not a return to Pentecost so as to
[23:50] perpetuate the church ages so this is
[24:00] the last day of harvesting
[24:12] because this is the calling out and the
[24:15] calling home of the bride and Jesus is
[24:16] the
[24:17] sister
[24:20] they were destined to be planted like a
[24:22] grain of wheat
[24:24] is
[24:26] and the early church would decline and
[24:29] go into the ground on the Azteca
[24:33] and come up as a blade
[24:37] but in this day abandoned this was when
[24:40] Seven Seals have been opened
[24:44] allowing us to receive the open books
[24:49] with this title and inheritance to what
[24:52] Adam lost
[24:56] like I said yeah this doctor this
[25:00] advances us to a day that is different
[25:02] from any other day
[25:06] but this is Rapture Day by Jesus talk
[25:10] this is the going home of the Bride
[25:12] about it is the long
[25:16] EST
[25:23] bridge
[25:24] and the mighty Angel is here domestic
[25:28] analyst here the fullness of Christ to
[25:30] usher in the fullness of what was
[25:32] promised to the United States
[25:36] this was a day when Jesus the promised
[25:39] son comes who does is the target
[25:42] but you can't
[25:51] to minimize its importance
[25:57] two thousand years of there was a sea
[25:59] church this is things for 45 hours
[26:02] it was the original Grace
[26:06] but it was planted so when it comes to
[26:10] harvest again
[26:12] I don't expect something different
[26:22] will harvest again with the wheat seeds
[26:29] without the holy ghosts without the
[26:33] Pentecostal experience
[26:35] you are not entitled to this book
[26:39] foreign
[27:27] foreign
[28:27] by Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ
[28:31] but the abstract is not coming
[28:35] it's the clearing of the day that is
[28:38] declare on this Palace but you see you
[28:40] have to get a clearing of that deed do
[28:42] most of us
[28:44] the clearances when everything against
[28:47] it has been strictly
[28:51] and you've got an abstract
[28:56] yeah it is yours as it's dying
[28:59] everything that belongs to you Allah and
[29:03] when we believed on Jesus Christ is our
[29:05] savior
[29:06] loudness Jesus Christ
[29:08] and we have repented and are baptized
[29:15] that God recognizes our repentance
[29:21] and our faith toward him
[29:24] sends down the absence
[29:56] foreign this is what God has done for
[29:59] the church God says
[30:00] he does it for the individuals
[30:03] that's it for the church to just feeding
[30:06] a mind the mystery truths that were lost
[30:08] during the past Seven Ages
[30:13] have been restored to us
[30:16] and the claims that Satan had against
[30:19] the church
[30:24] through the past Seven Ages
[30:27] church had to send that a false baptism
[30:36] and all kinds of misinterpreted Theology
[30:41] and the Book of title was closed and
[30:45] sealed up and Jesus
[31:42] and now we know what is our inheritance
[31:48] and it is not something different from
[31:51] the original Church
[31:55] it is
[31:57] Jesus Christ Evangelion from Jesus
[31:59] Christ whole did not come and bring
[32:01] another gospel Paul is
[32:03] Evangelion the gospel was brought by
[32:06] Jesus to his church
[32:08] Jesus and yes Paul expounded the gospel
[32:13] and talked God Powers these Evangelion
[32:15] invited but he did not originate it
[32:19] Peter preached it he said all the
[32:23] apostles
[32:24] and on the day of Pentecost I'm tired
[32:27] from Kingston now the gospel was coming
[32:30] into
[32:32] Mansion it was God writing on the tables
[32:36] of the heart that's why God tells sheep
[32:38] of the tough in his health the very law
[32:40] of
[32:42] goddess now there have been many types
[32:45] of Pentecost before
[33:09] [Music]
[33:15] are now have been pointing to this hour
[33:19] and this time
[33:23] man oh yes hallelujah hallelujah the
[33:28] first Pentecost that's the things came
[33:31] after the slaying of the Passover Lamb
[33:33] come
[33:35] and seven weeks later on Stephen
[33:39] on the 50th day I'm 56 and talk after
[33:43] leaving Egypt police they had the first
[33:47] Pentecost
[33:48] Fest amen Amen on that day on them Todd
[33:53] Moses went up into the Mountain King
[33:55] Moses and he received the law of
[34:01] goddess written on tables of storms
[34:05] that was the first Pentecost that's not
[34:08] let's ask the things amen it was there
[34:10] at Mount Sinai it's my daughter of
[34:12] Maxine the tattoos say that God married
[34:15] Israel Buddhism
[34:17] and took her as a wife
[34:20] because he had entered into Covenant
[34:23] when
[34:32] the people went horn not to other gods
[34:39] and Moses and anger on Moses himself
[34:43] threw down the tablet
[34:49] and this shows that a law that is
[34:53] written only on Stone um
[35:00] but that man would break it about the
[35:03] menstrual expression what doesn't change
[35:05] the heart but his friend at least this
[35:07] house but man's heart can still go
[35:09] whoring after other gods Abu Jesus
[35:14] and things three thousand people died
[35:17] starving dried thousand men because it
[35:20] was a law of death but gazette's taught
[35:23] us amen amen
[35:25] Israel was given Feast to keep the
[35:27] Passover
[35:29] and and and of Pentecost and the
[35:32] jubilees
[35:33] Israel games
[35:41] the 50th day after the Passover was
[35:45] Pentecost
[35:47] 50 years was a jubilee
[35:52] where slaves could go free
[35:55] Australian content but they were only
[35:57] typing I was even wanting to or
[36:00] foreshadowing the coming of the perfect
[36:02] lamb
[36:03] just comment is fully common in love but
[36:06] finally
[36:07] after thousands of passovers now
[36:11] you know they would come uh John who
[36:15] would introduce Jesus and say Behold the
[36:18] Lamb of God come Johannes there is
[36:21] the Lamb yes he will take away the sin
[36:25] of the world
[36:27] and not to pass over and Pastor he
[36:31] became the Supreme sacrifice evidence
[36:33] hurts to opt for for all the sins of man
[36:36] the only certain dimensions
[36:41] for he's the Supreme sacrifice the form
[36:45] for an up first 50 days later
[36:47] through Pentecost king that's why all
[36:50] things can come this was a jubilee of
[36:52] Jubilee that's fine
[36:54] but those who were slaves to sin and
[36:57] foreign
[37:07] [Music]
[37:57] in our day I don't know foreign
[38:06] [Music]
[38:18] but now and yet is when the day of
[38:21] Pentecost fully comes it's been a
[38:23] thoughtful things to fall into filters
[38:25] let me announce it to death
[38:27] this is the Jubilee of jubilees
[38:31] with those who are enslaved Rising sin
[38:35] and darkness
[39:00] to its original
[39:03] s
[39:05] you can take possession
[39:32] to the complete inheritance
[39:37] therefore anything in the book that's
[39:40] what Alice was eating Bugis is ours is
[39:44] is in the book
[39:46] healing is
[39:48] salvation
[39:54] [Music]
[39:57] disguises anymore
[40:05] [Music]
[40:19] amen amen race now don't try to give us
[40:24] a different land than that of Jesus
[40:26] Peter or Paul
[40:30] Jesus papers and Powers this Bible is
[40:33] the land of the Apostles known Jesus
[40:35] Bible is
[40:39] well Paul had something different he he
[40:42] wasn't in the upper room
[40:47] you know the upper room was a place
[40:51] Paul wasn't there when Paul is finally
[40:54] started but Paul received the same
[40:57] experience of Apollos in feet
[41:02] amen don't think we have something
[41:05] different
[41:07] listen hurt when we see Israel going
[41:10] back to their promised lands
[41:16] Israel when the world wanted a solution
[41:19] for the Jewish people
[41:33] but you see they didn't want Uganda
[41:37] Uganda it was a beautiful land that's
[41:39] fine it's the fruit basket of Africa
[41:42] yeah
[41:43] but it wasn't their land
[41:47] they had a land they had no land that
[41:50] was promised to them by God that's even
[41:53] for God for high school no other land
[41:55] would do on kindness
[41:57] and I want to say to you
[42:00] we have returned to the homeland of the
[42:03] Bible this is
[42:04] London
[42:06] Beach
[43:06] so it is the land that foreign
[44:24] don't you dismiss prayer lines
[44:30] we can't get ruptured faith in a prayer
[44:32] line
[44:34] you become well let me just tell you I
[44:38] happen to be and see prayer lines
[44:41] these are brother branhams
[44:45] I was in brother Brandon's meeting when
[44:48] people receive justification
[44:54] I was there when a sister in my church
[44:58] gave a personal witness because she was
[45:00] she was just three or four people away
[45:02] from this or in the prayer line and
[45:04] espressos
[45:21] and baby he said if you repent of those
[45:25] cigarettes
[45:27] God will give you a baby don't give God
[45:30] your own baby and right there when God
[45:33] adores that woman was justified in the
[45:35] presence of God
[45:36] again by goddess and this young sister
[45:40] but also it's a teenager slipping around
[45:42] and smoking at all some teenagers
[45:45] and she began to pray right there
[45:49] forgive me God forgive me I didn't know
[45:51] how wrong this was
[45:53] this and just three to five people away
[45:56] from Floyd week not 10 hours these
[46:00] things the weeks of fasting for fast but
[46:03] in a prayer line he steps up in the
[46:06] presence of the Angel of the Lord
[46:10] and her sins could not be called out
[46:12] only of a certainly because they're now
[46:16] under the blood verses in the absolutely
[46:18] blue
[46:20] I've seen people filled with the Holy
[46:22] Ghost Japanese
[46:25] demons cast out himself
[46:35] the Holy Ghost said we are justified by
[46:39] they're hiding you guys
[46:41] know that don't you yeah
[46:46] the Holy Ghost feels us
[46:49] the Holy Ghost gives us rapturing Faith
[46:52] the hiding you guys
[46:54] no you can't get rapturing Faith in a
[46:57] prayer line so it comes to organize
[47:01] you can get the ticket the tokenization
[47:05] become to the Rapture
[47:07] amen one moment time in the presence of
[47:11] God no I ain't a moment in the game
[47:13] about God your sins canceled that is
[47:17] dinosaurs token of the Holy Ghost
[47:20] because
[47:25] you can't get territory in a prayer life
[47:30] it only comes by suffering
[47:34] now let me tell you
[47:36] suffering will develop character
[47:41] but it doesn't give you character I must
[47:45] keep the kind character character is
[47:47] your nature yeah
[47:49] and your new nature comes by a new birth
[47:54] annoying guys and yes you can get born
[47:56] again in a prayer line
[47:59] if you can receive the nature the
[48:02] character of Christ in a prayer life
[48:13] he can come right to your seats
[48:20] foreign
[49:11] [Music]
[49:24] having no hair on her head
[49:28] because of alopecia a disease
[49:32] it's an autoimmune disease
[49:38] with three little bobby pins with dry
[49:41] cleaning hot water to put in her hair
[49:45] sister brother Timothy
[49:48] Timothy says Uncle Timothy I want to
[49:50] wear these
[49:51] things
[49:54] and she goes through that prayer linear
[49:57] and just months later when I find pamon
[50:00] he's got a full head up here
[50:02] the doctor
[50:06] amen
[50:26] I've seen it over and over again yeah
[50:29] except speed on Vita Gazette I've seen
[50:31] it in prayer line chops demon Spirits
[50:34] were cast out
[50:36] I am a witness it's been a tiger I've
[50:39] seen him while her on the floor he
[50:41] shoves I've seen him turn on the beach
[50:43] upstairs
[51:11] it said it wouldn't come out
[51:14] but in the name of Jesus Christ it had
[51:16] to come out
[51:20] why you say brother Tim
[51:23] you're just turning promotions
[51:26] foreign
[51:54] has tried to prove that this blessed
[51:57] thing that we have called the holy
[51:58] spirit
[51:59] is
[52:02] only emotions
[52:05] you see it don't stand up according to
[52:08] their scientific theory
[52:12] well I would like to ask him this what
[52:15] makes them change
[52:17] is
[52:19] what makes the drunkards
[52:22] the Drinker offered to think what makes
[52:25] a prostitute cease their evil life
[52:30] what makes the cancer and diseases
[52:33] depart from the people
[52:41] is
[52:46] he says is that emotion is
[52:50] he said it has a motion with it
[52:54] challenge
[52:57] for sure amen he said it has a motion
[53:01] with it certainly
[53:04] anything that's alive
[53:09] anything that that doesn't have emotion
[53:12] alism
[53:14] excuse the expression and surely it is
[53:17] now stroke but I think we ought to bury
[53:19] some of our emotionalist religions
[53:26] it has no emotion to it
[53:30] in a religion that has that emotion
[53:32] should be buried
[53:37] because it is emotional
[53:42] but we're in the third pole and the
[53:45] vision of the third poem
[53:48] brother Brandon said there was an altar
[53:51] culture
[53:53] somewhere and a prayer line had just
[53:55] been called
[53:59] so in the third pole the opening of the
[54:03] word
[54:07] prayer lines
[54:13] amen so you can't be preaching the third
[54:16] pull
[54:18] and the opening of the words
[54:21] and deny prayer lines and altar calls
[54:24] for life and debates
[54:25] and we cannot replace a true genuine
[54:29] experience with psychology
[54:38] foreign
[54:58] well how would you feel about a doctor
[55:00] Viva is the funeral and Doctor Who read
[55:03] a book on gallbladder surgery
[55:07] and then called himself a doctor
[55:10] and she steps the doctor who wants to
[55:13] take your gallbladder off
[55:17] I want him to go to school a long time
[55:22] and then he can tell me about
[55:25] gallbladders
[55:28] but don't try your psychology on me
[55:33] because you read a book on it amen
[55:38] let me tell you something
[55:41] and it's not psychology we receive this
[55:43] is
[55:44] not a mind change to received by
[55:47] managers
[55:52] so this is the land of the Bible so
[55:55] Jesus
[55:56] this is the land of faith and love and
[55:59] power because it is
[56:01] we are walking where Jesus Walks the
[56:04] abundance
[56:05] we are preaching what Peter preached
[56:09] we are preaching what Paul believes
[56:12] it is not a new gospel
[56:15] it is
[56:18] the land of our fathers
[56:21] and restoration is more than just
[56:24] restoring Doctrine
[56:26] is
[56:29] restoring sons of
[56:32] goddess back to their original position
[56:35] of sonship
[56:39] the land of Israel without his people is
[56:42] just a Barren land that's land Israel
[56:44] only the Lord
[56:46] Islam it was a wasteland in London full
[56:50] of swamps and Barren land full of food
[56:55] until the people of the book best
[56:58] came back to its lands
[57:01] and the Bible or the people without its
[57:05] people ordered is just another book it's
[57:09] Amen you must have the people of the
[57:12] books
[57:23] to their positions
[57:29] hallelujah hallelujah we can go to the
[57:32] land you couldn't get into them ancient
[57:35] landmarks
[57:37] here is Shiloh oh yes God moved in the
[57:42] past yes
[57:47] here's the brook yes these are gliders
[57:49] this is a very broke where David picked
[57:52] out five stones
[57:59] but without the people taking their
[58:02] possession about all the delighted he is
[58:05] the land still belongs to somebody else
[58:09] but in this last stage in this lesson
[58:13] title of allowed itself we receive a
[58:15] messenger and thinking behind it and
[58:17] found behind both angels that advances
[58:21] the church from the Azusa Street
[58:23] movement they are breaking the Mind upon
[58:25] these Azusa here to becoming the bride
[58:28] she was a Pentecost Dustin come to Zion
[58:31] and abroad the weak crop
[58:35] advancing the world of vital foreign
[1:00:00] foreign
[1:00:02] and then in verse 28 28 says
[1:00:06] come to pass afterwards
[1:00:09] my spirit does his mind guys
[1:00:13] and your sons and daughters shall
[1:00:16] prophesy
[1:00:18] your old men shall dreamed dreams
[1:00:26] and upon the handmaids in those days
[1:00:28] will I pour out my spirit connection
[1:00:34] now Peter picked up the same scripture
[1:00:37] to be his inauguration sermons
[1:00:46] and he said this is that which the
[1:00:48] prophet
[1:00:50] artists there's going to be a
[1:00:53] restoration
[1:00:55] come back to the same scripture one more
[1:00:58] time
[1:01:02] and it can't be so
[1:01:04] foreign
[1:01:19] [Music]
[1:01:28] foreign
[1:02:41] God damn
[1:03:13] manifested in diverse signs and wonders
[1:03:16] and Gifts of the Holy ghosts
[1:03:19] he returned to the same thing
[1:03:23] we have to have the same pure word of
[1:03:25] God
[1:03:27] the power of God
[1:03:30] signs and wonders foreign
[1:04:29] [Music]
[1:04:53] and others have reviewed and dissected
[1:04:56] the mechanic
[1:05:55] have every promise of God
[1:06:53] greater or more than these shall you do
[1:07:15] why because it was changing from a
[1:07:19] singular Ministry
[1:07:22] to a body Ministry so item Library I
[1:07:27] want to say to you is oh one man's
[1:07:30] scriptures have been fulfilled Allah
[1:07:33] we saw the manifestation of God
[1:07:37] just as it was in Jesus
[1:07:40] we saw the same Messiah sign yes
[1:07:44] that Jesus showed them through the
[1:07:47] prophetic office now thus Jesus
[1:07:51] yet what the son of man revealed himself
[1:07:54] as always mentioned these steps
[1:07:57] allowed and revealed the thoughts and
[1:07:59] intents of the heart
[1:08:05] when he said your name is Simon
[1:08:08] says
[1:08:23] where he discerned her life
[1:08:30] you've had five husbands
[1:08:33] if you're living with is not your
[1:08:35] husband
[1:08:37] this was the same sign he showed in the
[1:08:40] days of Abraham that's what the
[1:08:42] celebration
[1:08:43] when he deserves hard in the tent behind
[1:08:47] him so the sheets
[1:08:49] and discerned her heart and said why did
[1:08:51] Sarah laughed
[1:08:54] because it was the same son of man
[1:09:04] became and that sign was shown in that
[1:09:08] day
[1:09:09] but God indeed this day of a god undies
[1:09:13] and talk he did not have to gather up
[1:09:16] dusted
[1:09:18] himself for the body
[1:09:24] he had redeemed man he had a last
[1:09:28] Dimension and now he could step into a
[1:09:31] redeemed vessel
[1:09:33] and but see that when we could see the
[1:09:36] ministry of Jesus Christ repeat again
[1:09:42] amen all in a one-man Ministry
[1:09:46] and now all one man's scriptures are
[1:09:50] fulfilled Iron Man
[1:09:53] so we go back to John 14 12. so give me
[1:09:56] yes
[1:09:57] where that more than this shall you do
[1:10:00] and it goes into a body Ministry
[1:10:05] so it's not now just one man having a
[1:10:09] prayer line so this is
[1:10:11] Hysteria
[1:10:31] and you calm down you start in Uganda
[1:10:33] he's there in Belgium or France or they
[1:10:36] started in Belgium right here in Germany
[1:10:39] the same God the Savior God and there
[1:10:41] are to be healings or does it highlight
[1:10:43] and deliverance in every ministry as we
[1:10:48] are commissioned to fulfill Mark 16
[1:10:51] to a feeling in my name is
[1:11:03] the Great Commission it is ours to
[1:11:07] fulfill
[1:11:08] it Joshua was commission
[1:11:11] to take the land

[1:22:45] it is the last message of Jesus Christ
[1:22:49] to his church just elect the border from
[1:22:51] Jesus Christ
[1:22:52] everything else is a lie Allah
[1:23:01] I know always right we've had men arise
[1:23:05] as the eighth messenger the heart and
[1:23:07] Lord
[1:23:09] we've had our share of German Eagles
[1:23:15] that claim to be Aaron until I'm
[1:23:18] supposed to Ireland design to help Moses
[1:23:21] say what he couldn't say because he had
[1:23:23] Kentucky grammar
[1:23:25] versus
[1:23:27] Kentucky slang you know
[1:23:30] Apostles just set an order and bring
[1:23:33] Clarity to what the prophet said
[1:23:38] let me tell you the message of Jesus
[1:23:41] Christ
[1:23:46] he didn't need need a German eagle to
[1:23:49] explain it
[1:23:51] he didn't need some Aaron yeah
[1:24:07] we're beyond that today
[1:24:13] something that old Paul didn't have yeah
[1:24:16] we've got something else
[1:24:19] we got the opening of the seals
[1:24:22] the opening of the seals that's Earth
[1:24:25] from the seagulls only restored the book
[1:24:27] back to us
[1:24:36] the truth of serpentine wasn't lost upon
[1:24:39] the truth of serpentine was not lost to
[1:24:42] Paul does the divided foreign
[1:25:07] [Music]
[1:25:16] not an
[1:25:22] opportunity
[1:25:27] the lab book was not sealed to Paul the
[1:25:29] school foreign
[1:25:49] they are new to us so those doctrines
[1:25:53] are new to us
[1:25:59] he was an original landowner
[1:26:04] the two new birth was not a mystery to
[1:26:06] pause
[1:26:09] and he knew it was more than believing
[1:26:12] he said if you received the Holy Ghost
[1:26:15] sensually
[1:26:18] it was an experience
[1:26:20] where he was filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:26:25] is more than speaking in tongues
[1:26:28] because he knew that someone could speak
[1:26:31] with tongues of men and angels
[1:26:35] have the nature of God
[1:26:38] that wasn't a mystery
[1:26:41] the prophet of God in this day did not
[1:26:44] add truce to the Bible
[1:26:50] [Music]
[1:26:51] he brought us back to the land where
[1:26:54] Paul lived
[1:26:56] in the gospel Paul preached today
[1:27:03] brought light to the truth that Paul
[1:27:06] preached last of divine apologies
[1:27:10] he was a restorer
[1:27:13] to turn the hearts of the children back
[1:27:16] to the faith of the father um
[1:27:21] [Music]
[1:27:25] oil level
[1:27:29] listen when Elijah he was a restoring
[1:27:32] prophet

[1:27:43] of the old altar foreign
[1:27:52] God head back in his place
[1:27:56] the water baptism back in his face
[1:28:00] the truths of the Gospel back in his
[1:28:02] place
[1:28:04] and put Christ there on top of all those
[1:28:07] doctrines
[1:28:14] things are sacrifice
[1:28:16] and he turned the heights of the
[1:28:19] children back to the original faith on
[1:28:21] the event of the house and they've
[1:28:23] kidnaps
[1:28:24] and that's what the opening of the seals
[1:28:27] did
[1:28:28] it exposed the Antichrist spirit it's
[1:28:31] not his notary Christian guys and laugh
[1:28:33] who went forth to conquer and to conquer
[1:28:35] their King had fallen invited through it
[1:28:38] the church out of the land

[1:29:21] starting with the demon Spirit
[1:29:23] impersonating Christ thing Ahmed and
[1:29:26] emotions
[1:29:27] on a white horse and fear going forth to

[1:29:34] then that horse turned Blood Red
[1:29:37] foreign
[1:29:53] but now the cover
[1:29:58] and exposed his work through the ages
[1:30:04] it's been uncovered by the resurrected
[1:30:07] Christ as Lord
[1:30:09] lamb who was playing
[1:30:13] that was close
[1:30:17] I've sent it down by Revelation

[1:31:45] and prophecy
[1:31:47] foreign God will be in the midst of her
[1:31:50] but God will declare himself in the
[1:31:53] midst of her
[1:31:55] in the middle
[1:31:57] and every age he says he that had the
[1:32:01] spirit let him hear what the spirit says
[1:32:05] how tragic it is this first stage to not
[1:32:08] listen to the spirit

[1:34:40] don't hold back in his
[1:35:40] the Holy Ghost sanctification
[1:35:44] there's a deeper shadow of it and it was
[1:35:47] the Holy Ghost by the baptism of it
[1:35:51] deeper Shadows
[1:35:53] but now the Holy Ghost by the
[1:35:56] restoration of this very person being in

[1:37:06] Hitler warning him he would burn in fire
[1:37:09] yes
[1:37:13] if he kept persecuting Christians and
[1:37:15] Jews
[1:37:18] before he stands for the faith
[1:37:21] he was arrested and while in prison he
[1:37:24] wrote several books with the anger
[1:37:26] Sprouts
[1:37:28] he owned a beautiful home and it was
[1:37:31] confiscated taken away from him
[1:37:36] and when the war was over
[1:37:39] the round and preached
[1:37:42] he told everyone that after he completed
[1:37:45] his trip on the exactly Aiden does not
[1:37:47] amenities
[1:37:51] last foreign
[1:38:45] they were not

[1:38:53] today can possess the same Holy Ghost is
[1:38:56] that
[1:39:04] ought to make everyone of us rejoice
[1:39:05] that's all the influence you will love

[1:39:09] to hold it back why doesn't it
[1:39:13] the evening light is
[1:39:15] too common and it scattered the darkness
[1:39:19] upon the world
[1:39:22] the original life
[1:39:24] not just a gift of the spirit
[1:39:27] just to Justified life
[1:39:33] the original life
[1:39:36] amen the spirit of God himself just guys
[1:39:39] call himself the token today you can
[1:39:43] receive the fullness of the spirit of
[1:39:46] this guys
[1:39:51] himself
[1:40:00] let's understand something let us
[1:40:03] understand something
[1:40:04] there were many great prophets down to
[1:40:07] the age of Old Testament
[1:40:09] industry but we think we're filled with
[1:40:13] the spirit
[1:40:14] um
[1:40:15] in the Old Testament we think of Moses
[1:40:18] in my own Testament sealed with the
[1:40:20] spirit the fruit with him guys John
[1:40:23] filled with the spirit Johannes from his
[1:40:26] mother's womb that was a terminology of
[1:40:29] being filled was referring to in the
[1:40:33] anointing that's fine
[1:40:38] you see these men were working and
[1:40:41] prophesying under the anointing of the
[1:40:44] spirit
[1:40:48] for the Holy Ghost could not yet enter
[1:40:51] into humans but guys
[1:40:55] under the blood of bulls and goats or
[1:40:58] did in blood from birth
[1:41:00] because the nature of those innocent
[1:41:03] sacrifices while this is not too often
[1:41:05] for this could not come and dwell in a
[1:41:09] man Contin
[1:41:33] ues nature expelled and replaced sin
[1:41:37] nature
[1:41:42] and for the first time
[1:41:45] in all of history
[1:41:51] were possessed by the holy ghosts
[1:41:57] this is a new testament Doctrine this is
[1:42:02] that's why Jesus taught
[1:42:05] Jesus you must be born again the most
[1:42:08] following let's go to John 7 37 lessons
[1:42:15] in the last day of the great uh the
[1:42:17] great day of the feast
[1:42:19] um let's talk to The Ghost and talk is
[1:42:21] the special Jesus stood and cried and
[1:42:22] said If any man thirst let him come to
[1:42:24] me and drink stand Jesus off grievance
[1:42:26] Prophet yeah unjust that they're coming
[1:42:28] to me until he that believeth on me as
[1:42:30] the scripture has said
[1:42:33] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[1:42:36] Living Waters Hallelujah
[1:42:56] for the Holy Ghost was not yet
[1:42:59] guys
[1:43:05] you see the Old Testament Prophet so
[1:43:08] this is the Old Testament it will be
[1:43:10] anointed and in that sense be filled
[1:43:13] with the spirit
[1:43:15] not in the true sense of the spirit
[1:43:18] coming to dwell in man abandoned in
[1:43:20] advance
[1:43:23] this could not happen until the blood of
[1:43:25] Jesus Christ was shared business
[1:43:29] and then men and women could receive a
[1:43:32] new birth
[1:43:35] now Moses would get so anointed
[1:43:39] in the presence of God in the king about
[1:43:42] God even Revelation from God and things
[1:43:45] lip to ear to him
[1:43:49] and only a few days after that
[1:43:53] grieve the spirit of God I didn't guys
[1:43:55] do something that would keep him out of
[1:43:58] the promised land or advice
[1:44:02] but that's not so under the New
[1:44:05] Testament
[1:44:06] Hebrews 13 and 5. for he said I will
[1:44:10] never leave you
[1:44:12] I will never forsake his need for Simon
[1:44:16] so that we can boldly say so that's the
[1:44:18] kunzaga no it is
[1:44:22] fear what man can do to me
[1:44:36] [Music]
[1:45:06] [Music]
[1:45:12] he will never lose you
[1:45:16] hallelujah hallelujah so the anointing
[1:45:20] and the power of God would come upon men
[1:45:22] like Samson so it is
[1:45:27] he would slay thousands of God's enemies
[1:45:30] hundred thousand what God is fighting
[1:45:31] Islam only to be seduced by Delilah
[1:45:35] the spirit of God Came Upon him yeah but
[1:45:39] he could not abide in him
[1:45:41] you see every man comes into this world
[1:45:45] with some nature to these theater men's
[1:45:47] Community Development
[1:45:48] nature rules
[1:45:51] in your first birth
[1:45:53] and God will not dwell in a man until
[1:45:56] sin nature is destroyed when God was at
[1:45:59] least
[1:46:01] so you would see in the Old Testament
[1:46:05] man like the Prophet Elijah close the
[1:46:07] men of it the light just moved by the
[1:46:10] spirit
[1:46:11] great man of the spirit goes among the
