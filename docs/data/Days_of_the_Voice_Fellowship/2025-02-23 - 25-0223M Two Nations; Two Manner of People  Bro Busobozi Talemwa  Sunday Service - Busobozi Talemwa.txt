meetings ofam he would even put sockets in the eyes is there something God cannot do he can do all things if the nerves are dead you can put new nerves if the socket does not exist he can [Music] Pastor do you really actually believe that can happen yes sir without a shadow of doubt if I can't believe that and I can't believe God [Music] exists is more than able to do do you believe you canle up blood from cancer from [Music] ailments oh yes these things my God can do there is nothing he cannot do we fail but he [Music] cannot may it be unto you according to your faith amen Jesus we appreciate you and your presence this morning we thank you because of your grace and your faith your children your people are here this morning I know I've never done a thing unless you led me to do it before your children plan to come this morning to pray for the sick but as soon as I stood on the pit Lord you asked me to do it and I've just obeyed the leadership of the someone needed it Lord and that Lord you you're more than able to do but now we want to go and hear your word this morning and you said that you sent your word and you healed our disease that's exactly what you will do this morning Father Lord we are under expectation some are wary Lord from the wedding yesterday and from much work but may you give us strength in our body can be able to sit back and listen to you that you may do something in I pray strengthen us even the voice of my interpreter strengthen us Lord and may your word find place in our hearts in the name of Jesus amen amen [Music] may the Lord bless you church I just want to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen welcome back from the wedding yesterday was it not wonderful it was uh really a wonderful time uh seeing uh brother Alan and sister getting married it's a beautiful thing we still have um a few more that are ready uh that we are praying for and believing that they will also get married soon amen actually not a few more we have very many looking around I can see their faces and some of them even not here Sister Mary told me she went to Fellowship in another place uh for wanted to accomplish something there and um so uh and I know many are also tired from the wedding not able to come to the service I do not support that just for the record just for the record just for the record I'm saying that just for the [Music] we usually have things weddings this that but I believe when there is a church on Sunday morning and your church is gathering your place is at your post of Duty and especially on Sunday morning Wednesday evening these are our main church services you are not expected to be anywhere else if you want to visit another church that is all right 100% all right as long as it is not during when your church is having a church service that's what our Prophet told us and that's what we believe can I hear 100% amen your duty is at your post of Duty and your post of Duty is your home Church you don't only pay tith you have to come and be there maybe for only a few cases who are very far maybe out of the country nearby then they have to come and fellowship um by way of the internet but even those who go far there's a church close by I usually recommend them to first go to the church where they they to have to participate in in a physical church service and then they can stream our service afterwards there's no there's nothing that can replace physical Church attendance streaming is just an option it's an option yeah but you should never say I stay at home I'll stream it is not right you should always come to church always come to church being online cannot replace church service but if you are in a situation that you fixed and maybe you far or something very sick or you very sick then you can stream as an option why we put on the live stream so that after service we can go back and listen again that's the purpose and for those who are far in other countries especially that are a part of this ministry for them and they support the ministry here I don't believe in taking tithe from people and you're not feeding them with we make this available for them I remember the way we started actually streaming our services when the church in aasa did not have a pastor at the time and we had about 5 10 then they became about 20 needed to to listen to stream the services that's how we started streaming so it is for those purposes but for the church here we should not abuse that we should always come to live church service I see 50% is here this morning and that's not good you should always come to church service will understand this time around all of us are from no I can never understand why you don't come to church when I have come I can never understand um personally I've been very busy for uh a long time and my body is beaten down we had the wedding we slept past midnight but then I had to prepare myself to come and minister so imagine going through all that suffering that sacrifice and then I come inside and you you are not here so I'm doing it for who I'm doing it for the you my children so if you're not here it is a heartbreaking for me your pastor who is expecting you to come God has given me food for you sometimes when I'm studying God can tell me even this one is for fortunate this this one when I come sometimes I even do like this forunate I become so discouraged give me something for I'm not saying forunate I'm giving an example sometimes God gives me something specifically for a person and I can assure you that can't happen in the church you are visiting can only happen at home so you see that's why you must always come to church amen amen you must always come to church it is your duty it is a responsibility we can never overemphasize that we can never overemphasize that whenever I talk about it I feel I've not exhausted it the way I would have talked about it but the Bel understand those of you who regularly attend church there people I know that this one will be there that one will be there even when I don't see them I know there is a big issue even call them how but someone who misses 2 3 4 one is always like that so don't let your pastor say that one is always like that be among those that your pastor can even call when you miss or send a message that means he notices your absence and your presence um we have um um you know uh people that can even be coming to church for more than a year but your pastor doesn't know you that is a sign you are not regular you know pastors are responsible spiritually speaking before God they have to give accountability for the souls God gave them to sh and so you should always let them do their work with joy your mother cooks food and um then all all you boys and girls make yourself so busy with other things she will feel so bad I have a wife at home who is also my mother now and I'm her husband and I'm her father now so so when she cooks food and she brings it to me and it happens not to be my favorite and I don't eat it she always feels that broken and she always shows it to me and I feel bad about it and I believe that's how a pastor feels the same way a mother felds amen so you should always make your pastor happy if your pastor is happy your deons are happy I can assure you God is happy with amen amen I don't always say such words but I I realize as a pastor you I cannot run away from them [Music] that I'm going to give I hope brother have not thrown away your key ah right here okay so we have a testimony and a prayer request I think I'll give that last first I want to welcome sister Church where is she Bless yeah thank you for coming to fellowship with us and also uh sister Betty from badia where is she oh

amam is this going to continue going off and on Genesis 2521 we are going to read up to verses 24 to we are beginning from verses 25 although this sound was is not as good as that one was so you need to maybe increase it I do not know what you need to do uh vers 20 chter 25: 21 every everybody there if you're there say amen yeah I think that's good now and Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife because she was Barren and the Lord was inre of him and Rebecca his wife conceived and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am I thus and she went to inquire of the Lord and the Lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the Elder Shall Serve the younger [Music] [Music] [Music] amen praise the Lord and when her days were to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb two manner of people one shall be stronger than the other two Nations amen may God bless you you may uh there always has been something about child birth there has always been something about child birth and um you know that's why I it's not a Doctrine but I always prefer I told my wife I don't want twins because twins there's a lot of mystery about twins in you will never find both twins spiritual most of the time in the Bible one twin is bad and one amen one twin is bad and another twin is good I love that you know when you you you you come to church on Sunday morning I did it so I love that I love the couples that do praise God so I was talking about twins before I was rudely interrupted by the so um usually one is good and one is bad who will get into it culture they usually have Traditions around twins that they do that if you don't do them either both of them will die or one of them will die even the devil knows that something special and my mysterious about so person I told my wife I would not want to have I would like to have only children children children I don't you know when you have twins you can finish quickly but I don't want to have one B I don't want that chance I want to be sure that all our children of God praise the name of the Lord but anyways we want to thank God also I had forgotten to congratulate brother shame and sister f for the newborn amen they just had a baby boy uh I forgot the names but hear them the baby dedication so is not here she's being Nast by her mother home I'm sure she must be following this her sister is here where is she ah okay that's is a success God bless you so much amen we claim you also in Jesus name let the brother say Amen praise the Lord the Lord been good to you ask your neighbor the Lord been good to you some of you are just not even looking at your neighbor you have a problem with your neighbor has the Lord good been good what did your neighbor say your neighbor is very good praise the Lord amen two Nations man of now I want you to Bress yourself um because what we are about to get into is some good things for believers I don't I did not plan I did not come here planning to preach for Long by the way every time my target is to preach for 40 minutes to 1 hour but depending on how you pull sometimes I can preach longer by the way let me tell you when a congregation is cold and stretchy and they are not enjoying the word two things happen number one the preacher will always preach for longer that's the truth I don't want to explain it that's the truth and then another thing happens if they are receiving enjoying the two things one one thing happen the preacher will always preach [Music] short even if it is for three hours even if for hours understand what I'm saying you like you mean you've been here for 2 hours because you felt like it was 30 minutes because you were pulling getting drunk and enjoying a drunker does not get satisfied but if you are not drinking you will be so dry and stetchy and I will also preach for long if it is one hour it will look like I preached for five you'll be so sleepy and slugish and tired you understand church that's why I believe in a church on fire I believe in enjoying church I believe in enjoying a sermon when I go to church I don't like a preacher who preaches me to sleep that's why I left my denomination I have a preacher who preaches me to get drunk and I want to preach together with him and I assure you even if you you are tired if you enjoy the word tiredness will live you feel like again you are brand new you fresh again only that your amens are not there praise the Lord that's what happens so this morning let us be ready to fly together even if it is for 30 minutes even if for 40 minutes or 5 hours surely DF we can do that hallelujah amen but I don't believe in longer preachers even these brothers here Min the support Ministry when I ask them to preach and preach for two hours I usually have a big problem with them but if the people were drunk I have no problem with that if it is 5 hours are you hearing me let us get drunk this morning drunk not with alcohol with a spirit this hallelujah amen two Nations two man of people now remember I'm going to be doing a lot of quoting today as I do most of the times uh because I feel that my inspiration comes from the message and Bible so if I don't quote I don't feel comfortable but you love it when when we quote amen because it blesses our souls now this is the epas Church talking about the twins every Revival so here we started with the Book of Genesis where we see a woman the daughter of God married to a Son of God Isaac but you see she became pregnant and gave birth to twins but these twins were even fighting when they were still in their mother's womb these twins were actually two different [Music] seeds two different nations two manner of people but from the same womb so when you hear me saying womb I mean Church okay I mean Church the church called The Church of Jesus Christ not everyone that claims to be a Christian is the good twin no many times the majority are the evil twins matter of fact you will even see the older twin is usually the problem that's the truth it's what I see but like I said this this is not a Doctrine so if you're a twin you're the Elder twin don't get a problem with me I'm teaching something spiritual More Than Physical okay so you see and um you know these these twins were in the same womb same even from they came life came from the same father but there were two different seeds two different nations two different man of that's why the Bible says not everyone that says Lord Lord shall enter in but he that doth the will of my father and I believe these twins are in every Church well if you want many people would want to say all these twins are the message church and the denominations twins every church as we shall see says they are in every Revival even within the Revival of the end time message which is the last Revival you will find you know aspects of these twin so I want you to be very careful and listen today now remember each church has its formals and each church has its spirituals and I am the spiritual but they are the for they are Al I don't know who you are but I want to believe I am the spirit but they are also for thus the twins that's born in every Revival and lives every Church they started W in this age talking about that's where they started and it ends up can you see that former religion there is no difference between that and Catholicism you know in the days of Martin Luther Martin Luther was protesting against the Roman Catholic Church but you see his people became fanatic and they started breaking the churches the windows the mold and everything the miracle of his work and reformation and Revival if you want to call it that way the miracle of his work was not that he was a powerful man and that was not that the Revelation he had that they just shall live by faith alone it was actually the ability of staying under that fanatism or over that fanaticism he did not accept to be like to formalized like them he knew the pur of his message he stayed with his message he never came to bring division or to bring hatred of bring bitterness but he had a message they just shall live by faith and so we also have a message this message is not meant to divide churches bring bitterness among people but this is a Revival men to take us to Heaven he says every organization is butched right into it God never did organize his church that is exactly what they was trying to do here and you watch and see how now if that isn't right just show you how cast an organization [Music] is listen listen carefully God has never organized any religion God has never organized any church the Church of Jesus is built upon revelation of Jesus Christ that's the church in know when it comes to his church he doesn't know Roman Catholic he doesn't know angan do no PC he does born again he does he doesn't know you know all this UPC he doesn't even know ENT message doesn't know dvf he doesn't know spe doesn't know evening he doesn't know whatever those are just organizations those are systems of governing which the state needs Jesus doesn't need them his church is never organized and by the way this mess let me tell you something do you know that brother Bam's church he started here own churched which uh is in America in he bought the land and he built a physical building there at first it was called P Pentecostal Church CH but then told them no they they had to rename it to Bram Tabernacle tabac do you know the reason why God must have used them because every message Church in the world that believes his message would have been called pcal Church CH and that's another denomination would be in Jefferson so he said no I am not going to name it that so he named it he said in other words Bram Tabernacle who names this churcham Tabernacle it is weird imagine if we call ours to show you it is not about a man is about the message there are people all over the world that believe this message in every country oh did you see how many saw that video of those news okay a few I realize many people don't check their Church WhatsApp or they don't care go someone sent it to me and they said you were on on our TV brother get connected please quickly so that I was on their TV our church was on that TV so they they their French speakers so they put up you know this it's a channel and this channel they kind of listen to a lot of um uh you know news from all over the world and blah blah blah and I think the owners are believers of the message so they go Bringing news from all over the world I don't know them anyway so I just saw this video and um it is um you know they were giving new about our church days of the voice Fellowship the so and so and you know they were hosting a Vista you know and they were worshiping they were they Believers of the message and they are in millions and we have many like that all over the world and yet we don't have a headquarter any we are not organized into a system we are organized out of the [Music] systems every Revival on Earth has had two those twins the True Vine and the false Vine the true church the false church and I I wonder which church you personally are every organization has been out of the will of God that's why we cannot be an organization someone said one time why don't you gather all the churches of the message and you register yourselves it cannot work that way because we are not an organization we don't operate like one if you're going to get an organization it means you have to have a head and a headquarter and your arch Bishops soon you would see also people wearing robes and crosses and dog saying I'm the bishop of the message Church in ug in the Pentecostal Church they did not used to do that they used to preach the gospel after an experience they used to preach after they had an experience and God sent them out someone who doesn't even know how to read the Bible he would go out and read the Bible by faith and the Holy Spirit would give theming and they would go out start a church under a tree preach preach God heals people people begin coming mirac begin happening how Pentecostal churches started even in Uganda but as they became more and more they began to organize and when they organized now they felt like we can also be like them and now they have robes they've gone back to their mother but in the message we can never operate that way we operate by the leadership of the Holy Ghost they now started using Bible colleges but you know at first they never had even the first Bible colleges they started I'll tell you how it was they just spend their maybe like a week reading how to pray learning how to pray and how to heal the sick just a few things and then they go out but now they have to go and do study theology psychology a lot of unnecessary things and Apostle Paul said the words I speak unto you and not from the wisdom that man teaches and I believe the end time message church can never have a Bible call but you know as the people organiz but I know the church can never organize every Revival produces twins Isaac is well represented every time there is a Revival there is a es born and a Jacob born one religious man of the world gets tchy and take some Seminary experience and the other one wants the birthright regardless of how he has to get it if he has to be a Hool Lord anything he okay now listen church I want us to differentiate the two the twins the good one and a bad one okay the and ab the and if you want to know which one you are which one you are leaning to I want you to know how today we are told here every Revival are those two those twins in every Revival you we having a Revival those twins are still there one is religious he takes a seminary experience and the other one he wants something that thing is called the birth right tell your neighbor the bir right the bir right the bir right that is what Jacob is looking for how to get it he doesn't know but if he has to be anything he is ready she is ready if he wants to be a he watch the B you know there are many people who say and we know the holy spirit is not crying shouting running up and down and and and emotion it is the truth but many people who say it they say to say we don't need those things so that's where they are wrong the spirit is not those things yes the spirit is the person [Applause] when you a person let me break this down for you what a person you have your own characteristics your characters the things that make you up now when you come in someone else that someone else will live like you because they have received you so the Holy Ghost is the person of CHR living in an individual he becomes you and then he lives his life in you that is the evidence of the Holy Ghost but you know what when he comes and lives in you he he he he comes with a lot of things joy joy is not the Holy Ghost but it comes with joy you know sh and Fe just had a baby were you there when the baby was being born no this un feared but me have been there several times there is always noise but the noise is not the baby but the baby comes with noise when you hear the noise then you know the baby has come amen but also there can be noise and the baby is not there maybe someone else Shou maybe the mother is shouting because first is the noise of the mother so always wash those emotions he received it maybe not yet maybe that is you shouting the mother Begins by [Music] shouting and then when the baby is coming the mother keeps [Music] quiet and then and when the baby com then another so you see noise is part of the process before during and after the birth of a child noise is part of the whole [Applause] process and now jaob is the type that was is a twin that wanted something and that thing was the B he was determined to receive the bir no matter what the requirement was if took him rolling on the floor or to do anything else he wanted the B let me tell you you cannot overcome your lifestyle until you receive the bir it is the bir right that changes your nature the that you know changes everything about your life you need the birth you need the right of the firstborn that's what they matter with the people today they are afraid of that I heard somebody said that to get the Holy Spirit if I have to shout like that then I don't want it I'm put well I'm responsible and I began crying mucus coming out rolling down I don't want that kind of spirit he has his requirements the way he must get the Holy Spirit that is not God's way of doing things I'm going ahead of myself that's what the matter with the people today they afraid of the birri oh how that how they hate that and it produces twins every the men of the world they very religious incline they do good arms but just cares nothing about the birath those two great factions has been fighting since the world began the ones who don't care about the B and the one who are to do anything to get the B are you filled with the Holy Ghost if you are not which side are you which twin are you are you the one who is looking for the B are you the one who doesn't care I don't know about you me I want a b I'm ready to give up everything get the amen they are about ready to come to to ahead right now something that Jesus said they would be so close alike in this end time they would deceive the very elected if it was possible it is true you see what a deceiving hour that we living in stay with the word don't leave that word the word will speak for itself the Jacob line will R the birth but Jacob and Es were born in the same they are both having the same p and living in theob was different when I said we all living in the same atmosphere you know like we are all in church the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit we hear the same word and we all receive the Same Spirit coming upon us the same conviction but some will enter in others will despise it now let me say this you can never receive what you despise if you despise something you can never receive do not tell God how to feel you oh God you know how smart I am and you know I'm I'm different all these people are young people me I'm of age when you're feeling me don't make me behave like ashamed among I just want to lift up my hand I'm slowly by [Music] slowly something happened in me and then I don't want this mess I'm coming to you wait but Jacob was different he had a desire for the birth he valued it you know don't care how he comes be ready to do anything and everything he for you to do be ready and and ready for him to come anywhere he wants to come he you should value the birth right he knew he needed the bir more than everything else hearing receiving and acting in that message he says now Jacob it meant so much to him but the birth right me nothing to ES way the birthright is the holy spirit so frankly he despised it and I said this with all reference his children today but irans his children today are still despising the Holy Spirit he despises it and they despise it why do I have to do that for why should I receive the Holy Ghost I am as good as you are my religion is as good as you why should I go through all of that that praying seeking I'm just as good as you are I go to church I've got my name on the boo I am so and so that's what you are but what are you in the sight of God you got to be born again you have to be spiritually minded so it did not mean anything to heed it and they cannot believe today they still despise that birth and the bir is the holy spirit we know that he say and that cannot that cannot believe still despises the Holy Spirit and if you despise the Holy Spirit you can never be changed you will remain a last full woman or man you will remain a thief you will remain bad you will never be changed but you will be a religious someone can be in church for years very good Christians they even dress well but when they are rotten inside because they have never been chained they have never received an experience they don't want to to care about the birri all they care about is what can they get in this life they care about the Portage they care about the porage they care about the clothing they care about the school they care about the tution they care about women and men they care about you know their name they care about what they have accomplished their career their houses their land and all those things but all that to a child of God who is seeking the bath to them it is nonsense he says whether I get or I don't I need a I know I need a change I need something to come and change my life because the Lord I'm very last for I need a change by either way there is a power called the Holy Ghost which saves a sinner can deliver you you don't have to fake anything you don't have to pretend all you have to do is to seek amen remember he is seeking you more than you are seeking him and when you are ready and you are Desiring him then he will come and feel you and then you live in a community and you're different people can't understand why you can't do what they do they say it is nothing it is okay it for you you said no it is not the power for you young man or young woman say not your friends comes from the Holy Spirit it does oh my good Lord it does not come from knowing the word knowing the word comes as an addition if you know the word without the Holy Spirit you can never even be adopted fast things fast you have to be first filled with the a child has to First be born and when you are born now we can teach you the principles of the word and now you can grow full adoption the reason why people can't believe the word because they are not baptized into the Holy Ghost so they receive the word with intellectual Faith but not with faith the faith of the Son of God you need aen the experience with the Holy Ghost that's what you need and the B the holy spirit is oh he said the them but you see and I cannot believe despises that and he says them days are pass there is not such a thing as receiving the holy spirit that was in back in the apost is there someone like that here if you are here who thought that those days are passed I'm telling you that is a lie of the devil are still in those days these are the days of the apost these are the days of the of the book of us God is still saving God is still healing God still does Miracles God still changes he fills with the Holy Ghost he guides our lives he leadth us if you could lead a man in the Old Testament and a man would say the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he leadth me in the path of righteous for his name sake God still leads today God still speaks today God still cast out with my Naked Eyes I've seen many demons leave people crying and sing he still the same God [Applause] [Music] we are in the apostles days it has never ceased because it's the same yester forget about your religions and go back to what the Bible say this church is all about the Bible we have no other book by the everything else we read is point us to this the Bible is our absolute I heard a great man say one time in a church he said Pentecost was only the scaffold working to the building there are these things they build around the wall they use metal sometimes they use wood they scaffold you know they they go over it and they build they build they build there was a preacher who preached and he said was in that meeting P was only the scaffold walking the building and he said after the building is made we don't need any SC this is what the man was saying so at the end of the service brother came around to check this man's hand and he said I want to compliment your Su doctor doctor theology I said I agree with you that Pentecost was the scaffold work and as long as we are building on it we still have to have the scaffold the building is not yet over the scaffold is the last thing to take down amen I'm glad he says till you put the end of the Spy upon on top Tip Top you still have to have the scaffold I'm glad tonight to be working on the building I am standing on the scaffold then I'm standing on the Holy Ghost that's why we must be holy ghost we must be holy ghost Believers now we have we we have that we find that birth right is meant everything meant everything to jaob excuse me now he don't care for nothing else but that he didn't care what he C him if it was a mess of potage he was glad to give it back to Hallelujah Revelation just struck whatever you have to give up give up some of us oh my God may you receive it some of us are still holding on to some you are holding on potage don't look at me sad are you still holding on some page Jacob was ready when said I'm going to give you the pass but first give me that mess of mess of potage with gladness but some of you are holding on the mess of you are holding on your bitterness you are holding on your some of you are very good in English it is called whats you are a if you a gossiper you can't be filled I even saw some people

have to get it they are ready to get it but I cannot mind wants God to bring that down to their level you know God you know you love me even the other day Pastor said it's not what I've done it's what you have done to where I am you know how I am I I don't even know how to cry I don't know how to be touched and you know I am fornicat you know tried to [Music] leave come to my even this videos I you know I don't like even last time brother and he said you love the things you you know that's where so come and find me me stoping you're wasting you're wasting your time you have to come to a place where you say enough is enough enough is enough I've stopped this thing here I've drawn aine Satan you can't cross here you read your Bible this is what they all did before they had the power they all did that it is called decision read your Bible this is what Abraham did God told him leave your people I'll make you two Nations I'm talking about he said I'll make you a great nation Abraham said are you for sure yes Abraham took his friends his cousins nephews whatever they went together okay God has told me to go but he also knows I am weak and he even knows the love I have for this you know my Lord I've been with him since I don't know understand and then a brother come sings a song sister with a very beautiful voice sister and You Begin cry not because you are changing or you are deciding but because what you were already feeling that I can be with my you know how long I've been with you understand and then you remain and God will be quiet God feel [Music] me I know I called you but I not feel you until that is not with you who is to Lord don't you don't have to chase him that's the good part will chase [Music] himself everyone has an in them okay let's say your is your boyfriend don't CH him go back and tell the people the Pastor said don't CH your boyfriend go back and tell hallelujah amen yes this what I say here is what you should do come to a place where Abraham came and he drew a line he says Lord you know how much I love you you are my brother but today I'm giving you an option choose where you want if you go north I go south go sou I go me I will not choose you know how much I love you I have feelings for you so make the choice Abraham knew where he was going he knew he could not go in the city to go to the desert go to the desert where others will die only theant people die then you tell your Lord this is the line of drawn what I want you to know where I am going in case you want to know no sex before marriage are you understand what I'm saying not visting your home do you agree with me no I don't it's okay just hear what I'm saying not visiting you no you visiting me and just for your information I can't go to the club I can't also listen to you can't call me sweetheart I can't call you love until we married and also Lord I can't marry you unless you have the same calling I have you must hear the same voice of heard and then we can walk together so now Lord having known these details make your decision where do you want to go do you want to go my way if it is then come Lord together but first you must hear that voice and then you have to abide by but if not choose where you want to lot as lot [Music] is the city do you know what is in the city do you know in the city cigarettes Al when I find them in the desert beautiful girls useless boys me to go in the desert and I forsake the city you just you go in your desert go in your desert then you tell him thank you thank you you have made a good choice you're not the one who made a choice loot will make the choice Breen it is not to but a decision must be made when you make that decision when you draw that line and something is bound to happen amen am oh hallelujah hallelujah something is bound to happen a can of Mind wants God to bring the birth right down to the but for me this is brother I believe all two Born Again Christians we meet it on God's level I don't care what I have to do or what I have to say now I how I have to act the only thing I want that means more than popularity the only thing is I want it that means more than popularity that means more than my job it means more than my mother it means more than my wife more than my children every friend let me have that bir ride I don't care what I have to pay I don't care what I have to pay I want to meet God on his requirement whatever he requires if it is to fall in the dust if it is to speak with time if it is to run through the building and I act like a stand on my head I don't care what it is just so I get it that is the main thing that's the spiritual minded people they want the birth regardless they want it and as soon as they get it it sets up the same reaction it was in the family finally it will come to a place till there come a separation a man will have to obtain if he obtains his birth right he will have to separate himself from the world just as Jacob had my sometimes it means to walk along but if you really are sincere and you really receive the birth don't care to walk Al come walk with me the way is straight and come walk with me I cannot walk we are so happy when we say we are walking alone it means the rest of the world is not with us but when we say we walking Jesus shows up and he walks with us he walks with me he eats with me with me amen amen yes sir let me tell you friends I've been walking with him many have been walking with him you to can walk with him amen amen if the neighbors won't invite you anymore to come over to dinner if nobody will have anything to do with you what difference does it make to you where's brother oh he gave me a testimony some weeks ago how when he get began sinking into this thing his friends started that one don't even invite him what am I saying the world will no longer walk with you because you're walking with the word but if the word loves you is a problem with you I'm not the one they are the one who call me even you have a problem it is like me tell me I must have a problem you get aard you have something wrong an old girl who can say yes or no you can't say no he's the one who forc me the one who led me the way the way the serpent to Eve you mean I'm holier than Eve there's a problem with you you are not yet converted that's why when they look for whom to they come to you you are the one to Beed you are the one who is you are the one who they rob from because you need cheap things you are looking for free things a man has come to tell you do this and do that and you bring 5K you're going to get 50k okay you don't even care what does the message talk about what does the Bible talk about that we've been adved mess investment invest right invest in a a longstanding known company but you don't care as long as and then you put and then they take your for me they called me but because I'm a Believer I want to go to those people he will not he will have to work on you problem is you follow the beaten path two nations of people which man of person are you as I'm winding down I want you to ask yourself what manner of person are you long as I'm born again of the Holy Spirit what difference does it make if the this Fellowship from as long as you got a bir that is the main achievement of your life amen do you have the birth right no no say Amen have you received the Holy Spirit can you stand and say I've been born again the B of the Holy if you are not be sincere enough and begin longing for and do everything you can on your part for God to do his and don't rest until what difference does it make what the people say as long as we are walking in the [Music] spirit and all born of the spirit of God are led by the spirit of God Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of always walking in the beautiful light of the Holiness and clean that bir to him was he was kind like the world it did not make any difference to he thought he was religious and Papa and Mama was religious and that was good enough for you let me disappoint you you are not going to heaven because of your mother and father there may be Believers good ones doesn't matter you have to have your own decision that is the kind of person me in my Christian walk I've seen I've seen those people a lot of times but every time I see them a line I draw a line and I tell myself I don't tell those people I tell myself the decision they have made it is not their decision they are very good in influencing you you want to be a believer but you fear them how will they see me I remember my friend told me they also part of those stupid people now whenever remember that you don't want them to see you with the Bible when you see them working when he comes this side you come this side that is why some they don't car shame on you car your Bible to church not your iPad not your someone will find you you're going to church yes can I come with you but you are a girl very beautiful like so and so you are walking alone and you not yet very well saved you put on short things now there you still love worldly hair you have made all the world hairy you're going to where are you going I'm
