[29:56] christian i see quite many are not

[29:59] this morning
[30:04] but i only know of sister rose who

[30:11] grandmother
[30:16] and she went for barrio
[30:17] against them
[30:19] praise the lord come here we should
[30:21] remember her in prayers
[30:25] also i'm happy
[30:28] to see this young man i brother fred yes
[30:33] are you happy to see him coming
[30:57] he told me that he has a desire of
[31:00] coming to fellowship with us
[31:02] [Music]
[31:29] so this morning
[31:34] as you can see we have been disturbed by
[31:36] power government
[31:39] and
[31:40] we have not been able to
[31:44] run a hundred percent
[31:47] uh
[31:49] being trivial number two you know
[31:50] because the second because this uh
[31:52] can the projector work
[31:55] no okay
[31:56] i i had uh slides today that i wanted to
[31:59] show you already
[32:03] and then this is the day the devil
[32:04] decides to
[32:06] uh take the power
[32:10] and i never use slides when i'm
[32:12] preaching most of the time
[32:17] because i'm usually a preacher
[32:21] today i wanted to
[32:23] teach
[32:27] i wanted to teach on a subject which
[32:29] i've promised you many of you have asked
[32:32] me to deal with it
[32:37] it's a subject that many preachers
[32:40] especially in the message we do not want
[32:42] always to preach about it or to talk
[32:43] about it
[32:49] and uh it's been about a year and a half
[32:51] since this fellowship started and those
[32:54] are truly more congratulations
[33:11] we were still in the house fellowship
[33:12] between
[33:14] the catholics
[33:16] and a brother whom many of you know he
[33:18] came here also
[33:22] being part of the fellowship engaged in
[33:24] a woman of faith so how many
[33:27] uh how how many people were
[33:30] where were
[33:32] suffering in their financial lives
[33:35] [Music]
[33:52] and you see this brother came to me and
[33:55] told me
[33:57] he said you see you've been running this
[34:00] fellowship for about two years now
[34:04] you know
[34:18] so
[34:19] he told me i think you are
[34:21] robbing them of their blessings
[34:26] we need to teach them where to go
[34:28] because if people are well taught on the
[34:31] subject
[34:47] nate satan say i prepared myself then go
[34:51] nintendo and i spoke to the people on
[34:54] tithies and offerings
[34:58] 24 slides
[35:29] and have not never thought about it
[35:31] again but they sit down i'm good to me
[35:34] today is going to be the second time i'm
[35:36] going to do that in my entire life and
[35:38] career as a minister
[35:54] and actually most of you are almost
[35:57] many of you here will tell iran
[36:01] that i'm a giver since
[36:04] uh my life has been a giver from the
[36:05] very beginning
[36:09] not only giving money but giving time
[36:11] second gather centers of canada a good
[36:13] day but even with money he needs him i
[36:15] think most of you here have been
[36:17] beneficiaries banjo-kufai
[36:20] can you do it of money from me consumed
[36:24] many of you would know that whatever you
[36:26] give actually you received it back
[36:31] is that true
[36:33] those of you that attend this fellowship
[36:37] not a hundred percent that i'm not
[36:38] preaching this because i want to now
[36:40] begin collecting money from you
[36:48] but really it is uh my duty as a pastor
[36:51] to teach you women
[37:04] to go ahead and fulfill scripture
[37:19] i want to ask you to bear with us
[37:23] and i believe also this will be a
[37:25] blessing to you brother fred
[37:28] afraid you have attended the fellowship
[37:30] here many times
[37:33] you know i've not talked even about
[38:26] you can be able to if you want the notes
[38:28] and the scriptures again you can be able
[38:30] to
[38:43] okay so
[38:53] all right so uh let us stand on our feet
[39:05] and we are reading checking our bibles
[39:12] genesis chapter 14
[39:27] genesis is 14
[39:30] is
[39:45] and we are reading from verse 18.
[39:59] he says and melchizedek king of salem
[40:03] brought forth bread and wine
[40:05] and he was and he was the priest
[40:08] of the most high god
[40:11] and he blessed him
[40:13] and and said blessed be abraham of the
[40:16] most high god possessor of heaven and
[40:18] earth
[40:19] and blessed be the most high god which
[40:21] has delivered thine enemies into the in
[40:24] hand and he gave him taithers of all
[40:28] alvarez
[40:35] so
[40:54] praise the name of the lord come and
[40:56] give us the way
[40:57] amen let us pray
[41:00] preachers loving jesus we ask that you
[41:02] bless us and hear us today yes
[41:30] praise the lord
[41:35] now
[41:36] here we see of course we know who
[41:38] melchizedek is
[41:42] too many medicine
[41:44] and melchizedek he calls him a priest of
[41:46] the most high one
[42:00] abraham
[42:01] he was one of the three angels that came
[42:05] in
[42:08] and he was the one that remained with
[42:10] abraham while the two went to sodom and
[42:12] gomorrah
[42:33] so the bible also says on verse 20 and
[42:35] blessed and blessed be the most high god
[42:38] which has delivered thine enemies into
[42:40] the in hand into thy hand and he gave
[42:42] him tithes of all origin
[43:09] today as i just told you that we are
[43:10] really into a teaching already
[43:14] and uh
[43:15] for
[43:16] i i always cannot control myself because
[43:18] i'm a preacher that's my gift
[43:23] to enable myself to control myself so
[43:25] that i can be able to bring all the
[43:27] points that i need you to understand
[43:33] i have notes here on the slideshow
[43:36] to see what is saying and i will try
[44:06] and
[44:45] an offering
[44:47] it comes from a hebrew word called
[44:49] mention
[44:50] [Applause]
[44:53] that is offering h
[45:00] are you following me
[45:02] and that
[45:30] strike that is
[45:34] god has already determined
[45:37] and he has said it is a tenth part of
[45:39] all your possessions
[45:43] that is the type
[45:58] and then offering
[46:01] is a free will oh why am i saying
[46:05] it's a present
[46:07] you don't need to decide for me what to
[46:08] give if i want to gift you something
[46:13] so it's really your prerogative on what
[46:15] to give get it go away
[46:18] as an offering to god and get you
[46:20] everywhere erica praise the name of the
[46:22] lord amen so we see that abraham gave a
[46:24] tenth of allah
[46:37] is really the law of mothers they do not
[46:39] know their bibles
[46:49] that's why you know the bible says that
[46:50] the law which came many many years after
[46:52] it cannot remove that which was before
[47:02] praise the name of the lord amen
[47:04] hallelujah amen so the law was added
[47:08] because of transgression
[47:14] [Music]
[47:24] [Music]
[47:52] we might not necessarily need to follow
[47:54] now but after faith has been restored to
[47:57] us
[48:02] whatever was introduced by faith and
[48:05] because of faith and under faith we
[48:07] actually should still follow you now
[48:16] amen
[48:17] all right so now noticed that the titles
[48:20] were really given before the law
[48:22] everywhere
[48:27] all right so let us first get this out
[48:29] of the way genesis chapter four verse
[48:31] four today
[48:32] is
[48:47] of his flock and of the fact there wrote
[48:49] and the lord had respect unto abel unto
[48:51] his offering but unto cain and to his
[48:53] offering he had not respect and cain was
[48:56] very wrong and his countenance fell or
[48:58] whatever
[49:04] [Music]
[49:27] you know explanations on how the first
[49:30] feud should be given and how this but
[49:32] here we notice that our bell gives he
[49:34] brought off the fostering the first
[49:37] fruits of his flock
[49:42] why
[49:57] do you know why god was happy because of
[49:59] abel's sacrifice over his offerings
[50:04] because it was by revelation
[50:08] you see he had a revelation of giving
[50:10] the arena
[50:12] i've had some people who come to me and
[50:13] say well pastor i have got my first
[50:15] salary and i i pledge to the lord at my
[50:18] first salary i'll give it to the lord
[50:22] oh my god
[50:33] but i'm not going to stand here and tell
[50:34] you people you must bring all your
[50:37] salary to the lord first salary now yeah
[51:23] [Applause]
[52:02] how good
[52:17] you that you could be foolish you are
[52:19] doing it by faith
[52:22] without faith it is impossible to please
[52:24] god
[52:28] so the lord gives us a wonderful example
[52:30] in the lives of cain and abel uh in the
[52:32] area of bringing their offerings unto
[52:34] the lord
[52:40] everywhere even if both of them brought
[52:43] offerings unto the lord
[52:51] [Music]
[53:25] it's not the law it's the faith
[53:40] do you understand what i'm talking about
[53:42] hallelujah amen so notice that jesus
[53:45] well i'm talking about revelation here
[53:47] jesus talks about the giver who brought
[53:50] a a little dime yes
[53:54] center captivity
[54:02] and also there are other rich people who
[54:04] came
[54:06] back
[54:28] and then many church people have taken
[54:30] that exam and said oh yeah we should
[54:32] take coins to the lord
[55:05] into the lord god is able to bless you
[55:07] [Music]
[55:12] who uh you know the man of god elijah
[55:14] meth
[55:17] and you know she
[56:00] you will not
[56:57] also bring some food later i couldn't
[56:59] marry
[57:00] what are you talking about
[57:02] this is the only thing i'm remaining
[57:06] with for me and my son to to eat and die
[57:08] i'm gonna name anyone
[57:10] hallelujah amen
[57:12] but what changed your heart
[57:16] what what came to her teaching check the
[57:18] judge he made her give everything
[57:20] to the world
[57:22] it was a revelation
[57:24] it was the
[57:36] without even knowing that she will ever
[58:34] because you have plenty how are you
[58:36] going to be in chicago flowing already
[58:39] you you give because it is revealed to
[58:41] you you must kill oh wow
[58:46] and watch the blessing that follows

[1:00:15] be transformed by the renewing of your
[1:00:17] mind that he may prove

[1:02:02] you want to do it oh yeah
[1:02:19] sent someone to do something good

[1:02:28] of giving and surviving but together
[1:02:30] with you cry you know think oh when you

[1:10:54] here is your problem
[1:11:38] of all that come our way
[1:11:42] now all that come our way
[1:11:46] from your salary
[1:11:51] if you have inherited something from
[1:12:46] [Music]
[1:12:48] your tithe and then you don't give an
[1:12:51] offering
[1:12:56] it is a shame for a believer to go to
[1:12:58] church without an offering
[1:13:02] at all
[1:13:16] no one has ever gone to god without
[1:13:18] offering anybody again
[1:13:24] even those who got witchcraft now again
[1:13:26] don't go they go with an offering
[1:13:29] to a while they go with
[1:13:47] the only thing i promised myself i won't
[1:13:50] preach but you know the word of god is
[1:13:51] suffering
[1:13:53] the only thing a change that god has not
[1:13:56] and i have never demanded as a sacrifice
[1:14:13] sacrifice and giving has been a part of
[1:14:15] worship
[1:14:20] that the prophet said if a service has
[1:14:23] no offering collected it has not been
[1:14:26] full oh
[1:14:41] only natural to be your worship is not
[1:14:44] complete or causing the consequence so
[1:14:47] now that the offering is
[1:14:49] above the twice hey why are you cheating
[1:14:52] what guru is
[1:15:21] this is not there is no exception to
[1:15:24] this
[1:15:27] creature or no preacher you must keep
[1:15:29] tight and offended
[1:15:35] i have practice practiced this since i
[1:15:37] was 15 years old
[1:15:41] and in any accommodation of that
[1:15:44] given my death as an officer
[1:15:46] everybody are coming everywhere oh that
[1:15:48] i received an interview
[1:15:51] you see after the particular need all
[1:15:53] needs that are pressed presented to you
[1:15:55] through the your congregation a church
[1:15:58] or fellowship
[1:15:59] category
[1:16:00] the offering you give it to according to
[1:16:02] the need also sometimes that is
[1:16:04] presented to you
[1:16:05] through your church of fellowships
[1:16:15] just like here we are collecting funds
[1:16:17] for buying land for the church
[1:16:42] [Music]
[1:17:14] foreign
[1:17:16] praise the name of the lord come ahead
[1:17:18] now where do you pay your tithe as an
[1:17:20] offering
[1:17:24] if you're coming everywhere you give it
[1:17:25] to even a street preacher organizer
[1:18:39] you can fellowship and attend everywhere
[1:18:41] you feel like
[1:18:45] you have a duty
[1:18:48] and not do this to your home
[1:19:07] be meat in the house
[1:19:11] hallelujah right
[1:19:13] meat in the house
[1:19:15] what is the meat and medicine is the
[1:19:17] food admitted you made it they stored
[1:19:20] out food in that storehouse
[1:19:24] you know
[1:19:25] it needs to be there but it needs to be
[1:19:27] purchased
[1:19:31] things don't just happen everything
[1:19:45] [Applause]
[1:20:12] [Applause]
[1:20:23] for my flesh is made indeed and my blood
[1:20:25] is drinking deed he that eateth my flesh
[1:20:27] and bringeth my blood what it's in me
[1:20:30] and i in him
[1:20:48] so now you can see that the the flesh
[1:20:50] that the meat really is talking about
[1:20:52] here is the word
[1:20:55] so it says bring your diet
[1:20:58] [Music]
[1:21:06] hallelujah amen
[1:21:10] now preachers live
[1:21:12] of the
[1:21:22] the scripture says do you not know that
[1:21:24] they which minister about holy things
[1:21:26] believe of the things of the temple and
[1:21:28] they which wait at the altar i'll
[1:21:30] protect us
[1:21:39] a
[1:21:51] it is a shame for a minister here to
[1:21:54] come to you and tell your brother
[1:22:02] and i say to myself
[1:22:06] if i'm going to be serving god but
[1:22:07] abandoning the word is a catholic
[1:22:36] my wife and i were just so young and we
[1:22:37] were in ethiopia he's looking at the
[1:22:39] names
[1:22:41] we couldn't make ends meet
[1:22:48] and then
[1:22:49] god brought
[1:22:51] uh somebody
[1:22:54] that told me young number you see pastor

[1:23:17] and looked at our expenses
[1:23:23] we can't make it
[1:23:25] following man

[1:24:05] lord come here

[1:24:15] didn't get a 12 cent he was so poor yeah
[1:24:19] he removed his heart
[1:24:22] i went around the church
[1:24:24] and told them church today i want to
[1:24:26] take an offering
[1:24:42] this little
[1:24:55] [Music]
[1:25:12] actually many people benefited out of
[1:25:15] his ministry more than he adapted
[1:25:17] financially
[1:25:22] they would make meetings for him
[1:26:22] [Applause]
[1:26:33] you know they made enough money
[1:26:37] to buy a house
[1:26:41] and they were happy in it
[1:26:46] and god spoke to brother
[1:26:48] john you got a new organization
[1:26:52] this house is not yours and a new
[1:26:54] mercedes you are moving away from here
[1:26:57] and i want you to give it to that
[1:26:58] preacher

[1:28:00] [Music]
[1:28:15] and they gave away all the heart you're

[1:28:23] they gave away all their health
[1:28:25] why

[1:31:13] teach this today
[1:31:47] 18 21 says and behold i have given the
[1:31:49] children of life all the time in israel

[1:32:45] [Music]
[1:33:21] amen nina
[1:33:23] praise the name of the lord come here
[1:33:25] look at this
[1:33:27] in in in corinthians we go back he says
[1:33:29] even so has the lord ordained that
[1:33:32] they which preach of the gospel should
[1:33:34] leave of the gospel what do you want to
[1:33:35] assume
[1:33:42] but i have used none of these things
[1:33:44] neither have i written these things that
[1:33:46] it should be so and done unto me if it
[1:33:49] were better for me to die than that any
[1:33:51] man should make my glory void
[1:34:40] but he says for though i preach the
[1:34:42] gospel i have nothing to glory oh for
[1:34:45] necessities laid upon me yeah why is
[1:34:48] unto me if i preach not the gospel
[1:34:54] [Music]
[1:35:43] because we have a personal financial
[1:35:46] responsibility to our children
[1:35:53] [Music]
[1:35:54] area
[1:35:57] we have a pastor who is there for our
[1:35:59] spiritual needs food management of our
[1:36:01] church and he needs to live too
[1:36:03] much
[1:36:22] why unto him that buildeth his house by
[1:36:25] unrighteousness and his chambers by
[1:36:28] wrong
[1:36:29] that he uses his neighbor's service
[1:36:30] without wages and giveth him
[1:36:33] not for his wife again
[1:37:04] what do
[1:37:09] [Music]
[1:37:20] [Music]
[1:37:30] so if a preacher comes and preaches for
[1:37:31] us
[1:38:14] and that's the reason
[1:38:23] [Applause]
[1:38:35] there are several of us here who have
[1:38:37] different
[1:38:38] uh professional um
[1:38:41] you know work that they do
[1:38:56] can you
[1:39:24] oh
[1:39:39] of fact i must say man you should even
[1:39:40] pay him more than you better egyptians
[1:39:48] why do i love employing believers
[1:39:52] because i want to bless them
[1:39:55] that should be the attitude of every
[1:39:57] believer
[1:40:00] never let any brother serve you and you
[1:40:02] don't pay him

[1:58:47] you i would be the most
[1:58:48] the goodest hypocrite of a pastor in the

[2:15:26] is that okay
[2:15:28] from the message god being misunderstood
[2:15:30] [Music]

[2:15:35] because they did not pray
[2:15:40] and the prophet answers
[2:15:42] i would not say yes or no to that
[2:15:45] but yeah
[2:15:46] but i do believe
[2:15:47] that every christian
[2:15:56] because it is a commandment of the lord
[2:16:39] [Music]
[2:16:50] [Music]
[2:17:11] like some of you maybe from other
[2:17:12] churches
[2:17:15] you support your church
[2:17:17] that's your first duty to god
[2:17:21] bring your titles and offerings into the
[2:17:23] storehouse
[2:17:26] and the storehouse
[2:17:32] so that's where you get your spiritual
[2:17:34] food our generation
[2:17:36] and your obligation is through your
[2:17:38] church and not to an evangelist like
[2:17:40] foreign
[2:17:53] amen
[2:17:54] so
[2:18:22] they used to bring mature care
[2:18:25] or purpose and then they bring it up

[2:18:33] are you guys
[2:18:56] [Music]
[2:19:05] salt

[2:19:14] those kind of programs
[2:19:16] he says

[2:21:01] like that
[2:21:04] all the repairs and the buildings was
[2:21:05] taken care of of that fact
[2:21:24] that title and give them to a widowed
[2:21:26] woman
[2:21:30] that's wrong
[2:21:31] if you've got anything to give that to
[2:21:33] with a woman give her a name
[2:21:36] away but don't give her god his money
[2:21:40] that's not yours
[2:21:42] you're in the first place
[2:21:46] amen
[2:21:48] and that's what we are told
[2:21:50] and when i heard that for my first time
[2:22:05] god has kept all these promises
[2:22:10] you want to be blessed
[2:22:12] go for anointing oil somewhere
[2:22:14] don't go for a witch practice
[2:22:16] don't think you are cast
[2:22:19] in the solution
