[2:36] it says that in the year that King
[2:38] hoseah died I saw also the Lord sitting
[2:42] upon a throne High lifted up and his
[2:46] train filled the temple and two says
[2:49] above it stood Sims each one had six
[2:53] wings with the twin he covered his face

[4:49] precious name of the Lord Jesus we pray
[4:52] amen you may have your seats this uh
[4:54] evening
[4:55] amen we shall read also in Exodus
[4:58] chapter 33
[5:01] uh we begin from verses 13 14 and
[5:07] 15 Exodus chapter
[5:16] 33 vers
[5:26] 15 and he said unto him if th pray go
[5:30] not with me carry us not up
[5:35] than for wherein shall it be known here
[5:39] that I and thine people have found Grace
[5:42] in thy sight it is not it's not in that
[5:47] that thou goest with us so shall we be
[5:51] separated I and thine people from all
[5:54] the people that are upon the face of the
[5:58] Earth and the Lord said unto Moses I'll
[6:02] will do this thing also that thou H has
[6:04] spoken for thou Hast found Grace in my
[6:07] sight and I Know Thee by
[6:13] name blessed be the name of the Lord
[6:17] Jesus uh this evening I want us to I'll
[6:20] talk
[6:24] about I'll call it
[6:26] the the Vitality of
[6:30] God is presence
[6:33] amen I remember we've ever talked about
[6:36] uh being in his
[6:38] presence the prophet preached the
[6:40] message in his presence amen preachers
[6:43] have preached thousands and millions of
[6:46] Simmons about the presence of God
[6:49] blessed be the name of the
[6:51] Lord
[6:53] and in Christianity what keeps us moving
[6:56] on it is the presence of God
[7:00] without the presence of God this
[7:02] Christian walk becomes
[7:06] burdensome every time you find when you
[7:09] have to struggle with the Believers to
[7:11] come for fellowship or you are
[7:14] struggling with them to pray you just
[7:17] know there is something wrong somewhere
[7:20] amen but when the presence of God is
[7:23] there it
[7:26] act as Tabo
[7:30] blessed be the name of the Lord and for
[7:33] people who know how to drive or people
[7:36] who drive or who ride
[7:38] motorcycle even those who ride this
[7:40] sports
[7:42] bike when you are approaching the
[7:47] hill you'll have if if it is a motor
[7:50] kind of means you'll have to engage a
[7:53] heavy gear blessed be the name of the
[7:56] Lord and to me I may say that that heavy
[8:00] gear is that presence of
[8:02] God
[8:05] Amen even when you are riding the one
[8:07] they call
[8:08] M this local bike the hero Road master I
[8:13] even wonder whether
[8:17] Dan blessed be the name of the Lord
[8:20] those were the cars of of them days
[8:24] amen so even when you're riding a
[8:28] bicycle and you approaching the hill
[8:31] you'll have to add more
[8:33] strength and where we have read in
[8:35] Isaiah here we are seeing Moses speaking
[8:38] to God and telling God if you're not
[8:41] going with us so we are going nowhere
[8:43] because Moses knew or had a secret he
[8:47] knew what it means by the presence of
[8:50] God Amen so there is such a great
[8:54] importance of being in the presence of
[8:58] God what what is keeping us awake what
[9:02] keeps you moving up to today is that
[9:04] presence of God you can call it you can
[9:09] call it the pillar of fire because the
[9:11] Bible says that the pillar of fire led
[9:13] the children of Israel God LED them
[9:17] through the pillar of fire and God was
[9:21] hiding in the pillar of fire amen
[9:24] because God knew that these people would
[9:27] not go or reach anywhere without his
[9:31] presence blessed be the name of the Lord
[9:33] and that's why God put too much emphasis
[9:37] when comes to that because he knows that
[9:39] we as human being without God we already
[9:42] defeated beings but when God is in our
[9:45] midst amen and that's why Through the
[9:47] Bible you realize if you read the Book
[9:50] of Judges that each time these people
[9:53] entangled with the things of the world
[9:56] each time they stray they do things
[9:59] contrary to what God wanted them to do
[10:02] the presence of God departed away from
[10:05] them and every time the presence of God
[10:09] moves away you find chaos in their midst
[10:13] blessed be the name of the Lord you find
[10:16] them in battles you find them losing the
[10:18] battle and if there is one thing which
[10:20] the children of Israel were cautious of
[10:24] it was the presence of God in their
[10:28] midst but that's why they had strong
[10:31] laws whereby if you mess around
[10:35] amen if you play around brother I think
[10:39] I I think the voice was okay uh if you
[10:42] play around with that you were Stone to
[10:49] death that without God we cannot amount
[10:52] to anything blessed be the name of the
[10:55] Lord and here we are seeing uh prophet
[10:58] Isaiah in Isaiah chapter 6 is giving is
[11:02] saying something say that in the year
[11:04] that King oah King Uzziah hoseah died I
[11:10] also I saw sorry I saw also the
[11:16] Lord praise be to
[11:19] God remember Isaiah was a major
[11:23] prophet but the man is saying the day
[11:27] the king died he all so so the
[11:31] Lord sometime it brings a question to me
[11:34] because you say that I also meaning that
[11:37] others were seeing the Lord and Isaiah
[11:39] was not seeing
[11:40] him
[11:43] yes like he could hear
[11:46] testimony maybe about the Abraham about
[11:50] other prophets but here he says now he
[11:53] had personal testimony amen and that's
[11:57] why every Christian must have a personal
[12:01] experience with God we must know the God
[12:04] we are talking about we must know the
[12:07] God we are serving we must know the
[12:09] ground where we are standing this is not
[12:11] all about my father's God my mother's
[12:14] God my papa's God but identifying
[12:16] himself he said I am the god of Abraham
[12:20] I'm the god of Isaac and the god of
[12:22] Jacob he was identifying himself with
[12:26] individuals blessed be the name of the
[12:29] Lord and here Isaiah says that I also
[12:33] saw the
[12:34] Lord
[12:36] seated sitting upon a throne high and
[12:40] lifted up and his train filled the
[12:44] temple blessed be the name of the
[12:48] Lord so what happened to Isaiah here we
[12:52] are seeing this very
[12:53] chapter oah had to first die for the man
[12:59] of God to
[13:00] see God blessed be the name of the Lord
[13:05] you know one thing with this if you if
[13:07] you happen to have a visitation from God
[13:10] no matter what you're going through no
[13:13] matter the challenges you are facing
[13:15] what your neighbors are like they
[13:18] talking about you what you uh your
[13:20] friends are saying about you you will
[13:23] stand because you know where you are
[13:27] standing in this Christian work we are
[13:29] not men Pleasers but we are God Pleasers
[13:33] we are the children of God
[13:37] Amen and our duty on Earth is to serve
[13:41] God so when you encounter God you will
[13:45] know your position and your
[13:48] responsibility in the house of God Amen
[13:50] so but you come as a City of Refuge
[13:54] running for your soul blessed be the
[13:57] name of the Lord because we are living
[13:59] Liv in the time where the Bible says
[14:00] that we should not forsake assembling
[14:03] together of
[14:06] saints as we are seeing that day
[14:09] approaching when that day is approaching
[14:12] we all to be one amen because something
[14:17] is fixing to happen and the only way we
[14:20] can make it is when we are together
[14:24] Unity is strength blessed be the name of
[14:27] the Lord when we are one with are
[14:32] strong you bring your fire brother son
[14:35] so bring his fire and we make one big
[14:37] fire the devil cannot come near it
[14:41] blessed be the name of the
[14:43] Lord amen the prophet tells us about
[14:47] Isaiah I was blinded by the king all his
[14:51] Hope was on the
[14:54] King when he had needs maybe say how the
[14:58] king just after all the King was his
[15:01] friend he was
[15:04] there with a rich man who had everything
[15:10] Authority and all those things blessed
[15:14] be the name of the Lord but one day when
[15:18] the king
[15:19] died this man realized that he was
[15:25] alone many time we are blinded by the
[15:28] things and the people around
[15:31] us you know after all ah brotherus will
[15:38] H you don't want to struggle because ah
[15:41] enus is there he will help you don't
[15:44] want to do this uhuh I know he will
[15:46] stand in the Gap brother the time has
[15:49] come when we have to know that either
[15:53] you stand in the gap or no one is
[15:55] standing in the
[15:57] Gap blessed be the name of of the Lord
[16:00] let us carry the Lord's burden
[16:03] amen praise be to God when the king died
[16:07] Isaiah realized all along has been lying
[16:11] himself and that is what happened when
[16:14] we are living double standard life you
[16:17] sit in church for two days for one year
[16:20] 10 years 30 years in
[16:24] church attending all the three services
[16:27] in the week
[16:32] but my brother my sister there is that
[16:36] time when you have to meet God
[16:38] Alone that is what matters in
[16:42] Christianity
[16:44] amen that is what ought to make our
[16:47] hearts tremble to know that there is a
[16:50] time when we are meeting God alone when
[16:54] you are going to give account as you
[16:58] blessed be the name of the
[17:00] Lord I don't want to be disappointed at
[17:03] that last
[17:05] moment and I realize that I have run in
[17:08] vain I have battled in vain amen that's
[17:12] why the Bible says we should make our
[17:15] calling and election
[17:18] sure amen it did not say that so and so
[17:22] will make your calling an election sure
[17:24] this is all about an individual work you
[17:28] know where you are standing you know
[17:30] what you are doing you know whether you
[17:32] are Christian or not you know whether
[17:34] you are progressing spiritually or not
[17:37] amen that's why you have to make your
[17:41] calling and election
[17:43] sure blessed be the name of the Lord
[17:46] time came for Isaiah to meet the reality
[17:51] now
[17:53] amen and he was desperate you see
[17:57] desperation butam in the message
[17:59] desperation that God uses
[18:02] desperation to bring that which is in
[18:08] US amen So This Man became desperate
[18:12] because he knew now either God you help
[18:15] me or I die the same thing happened to
[18:21] Jacob you know as long
[18:26] as every time you move you feel it
[18:50] there blessed be the name of the Lord
[18:53] but there is that time when you have to
[18:56] meet the reality
[19:00] but thanks be to God that God always
[19:02] shows us how to
[19:04] escape the Bible it was for our
[19:09] examples that God's presence has been
[19:12] from the world in fact from day
[19:15] one amen God always want to walk with us
[19:21] he always want to lead us even when
[19:23] Jesus came and said that come unto me
[19:26] all those who are yoke with the heaven I
[19:28] day
[19:29] because when you are yoked with with a
[19:32] burden or with a ladden of anything you
[19:35] cannot walk it is a journey amen the day
[19:39] you were born on Earth you started
[19:41] walking and when you accepted Jesus
[19:43] Christ then you started now going the
[19:46] upward
[19:47] way and there are many things alongside
[19:51] this
[19:53] journey the devil has many obstacles on
[19:56] your way to make you not reach there why
[19:59] because he was there he know what is
[20:02] there
[20:03] amen you see nowadays like when you move
[20:06] around and
[20:14] people the place looks like heaven when
[20:17] the person has never even been in
[20:19] heaven but even in his conscience him
[20:22] being a sinner his conscience tells him
[20:25] that there is a better City a nice
[20:27] beautiful place somewhere amen now what
[20:31] the devil does he comes with a photocopy
[20:34] and try to make them comfortable for
[20:37] nothing blessed be the name of the Lord
[20:40] that's why the Bible tells us that our
[20:43] fathers they moved in ship skins they
[20:46] moved from town to town they moved in
[20:49] desert amen looking for City who he
[20:53] Builder and maker was God
[20:56] himself they never Ted brother they
[21:00] lived in
[21:01] tents they put like they wear sheep
[21:04] skins amen they were not comfortable
[21:08] because inside their heart there was
[21:10] something telling them there is
[21:12] somewhere where you came from blessed be
[21:15] the name of the
[21:16] Lord
[21:21] amen and then we are seeing the vision
[21:23] of Isaiah you saw the
[21:25] angels and what happened
[21:31] he realized that all along he has been
[21:33] wasting his
[21:35] time you know say yeah I've seen you
[21:37] angel I'm also perfect yes yes come on
[21:42] no he saw the glory of God he saw how
[21:46] belittle he was
[21:49] amen how merciful god has been to
[21:53] him because the Bible says that who is
[21:57] me even for him to see that
[22:00] presence he realized it was just the
[22:04] grace say what is me for man of unclean
[22:10] lips and he thought that dining with the
[22:12] King was such a great thing but here he
[22:15] says I even dwell among people with ugly
[22:20] lips that is what the presence of God
[22:24] brings
[22:27] amen it is the presence of God that
[22:30] makes you know what you are supposed to
[22:33] wear in the presence of God the only
[22:36] righteousness that can withstand the
[22:37] Presa of God is the righteousness of God
[22:41] that is the blood of Jesus Oh the
[22:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[22:47] amen that is the token that we
[22:53] need praise be to
[22:56] God Amen
[22:59] and he said the post of the the post of
[23:01] the door moved and the voice of him that
[23:03] cried and the house was filled with
[23:06] smoke then said I oh who is me for I am
[23:11] undone the presence of God will always
[23:14] bring us into
[23:17] repentance that's why the prophet tells
[23:19] us that Godly
[23:21] Soul brings us into
[23:25] repentance that is the grace of God we
[23:28] are seeing about the Amazing Grace that
[23:31] when that Amazing Grace is revealed to
[23:35] us with a Grace that teaches us to
[23:40] fear it is the grace of God that brought
[23:43] fear in his
[23:49] heart and the house was fill with SM
[23:52] then say I what is
[23:54] me because I am a man of UN
[23:59] first of all we have to know how
[24:02] insufficient we are we just man human
[24:05] being and I dwell in the midst of people
[24:08] of uning lips for mine eyes have seen
[24:11] the king the Lord of host then flew one
[24:14] of the Sims and to me you had to First
[24:19] repent Christian
[24:22] repent Amen to the to the to the prophet
[24:28] amen
[24:30] because God in fact God showed him all
[24:33] those things not to condemn him not to
[24:37] show how bad he is you are not even
[24:39] worthy you better go and die no but God
[24:44] wanted to show him something that uh
[24:47] there is something much better there is
[24:49] a place where I want you to be there's
[24:51] something that I want you to do for me
[24:54] but you cannot do it when you're in that
[24:57] state blessed be the name of the Lord
[25:01] and the angel
[25:04] coming he see that the angel and then
[25:07] flee one of the Sims unto me having the
[25:10] life called in his hand which are taken
[25:14] with the tongues from the of the
[25:17] altar amen it was taken off the
[25:24] altar blessed be the name of the Lord
[25:27] and what is this clothing tongue today
[25:29] brother sister this is the Holy
[25:33] Ghost God uses the Holy G he uses the H
[25:36] to cleanse the
[25:38] believer amen the Holy Ghost is the
[25:43] fire when he comes in our life he will
[25:47] cleanse all our
[25:50] Fields the fire we are talking about you
[25:53] see there's something uh there's
[25:55] something special with the fire of the
[25:57] Holy Spirit
[25:58] well the Bible says that when that fire
[26:01] came down even the stones
[26:05] melted and that is the fire of the Holy
[26:07] Ghost when he comes down he will melt
[26:11] each and everything in your life and
[26:14] that is what we need tonight amen the
[26:17] presence of God that will move Mountain
[26:20] the presence of God that will cleanse
[26:23] our hearts the presence of God that will
[26:25] set our hearts on fire the presence of
[26:28] God God that will bring Restoration in
[26:30] our soul the presence of God that will
[26:33] open our understanding the presence of
[26:35] God that will move our faith amen may
[26:40] God give us
[26:41] that there is abundance of being in the
[26:44] presence of God there was one man in the
[26:47] Bible his name is David one day he was
[26:50] Ring the Sheep of his father and the
[26:53] lion
[26:55] came
[26:57] David
[27:07] anywhere but David had an experience
[27:11] with God
[27:13] Amen David was already I was
[27:17] anointed yes sir and the bible say that
[27:20] anointing breaks the Yoke and anointing
[27:23] comes from the Holy Ghost
[27:27] amen
[27:30] he had encountered God where that
[27:35] presence came
[27:37] down it changed
[27:40] everything a young man slaying a bear a
[27:44] young man killing a
[27:46] lion brother that was not just an
[27:49] ordinary man but that was the presence
[27:52] of the Holy Ghost in that man
[27:56] amen talk of PSS
[28:00] that's why each time the presence of God
[28:02] moved from the of Israel they
[28:06] mour you find them pleading with God
[28:08] read the
[28:09] judges and God has always been faithful
[28:13] he always keeps his word and that's why
[28:16] he says those who are called by my name
[28:19] when they shall humble them themselves
[28:21] and pray amen I will hear their prayer
[28:24] from Heaven I will come down and amen
[28:29] and heal their
[28:32] land every time they drifted from the
[28:35] presence of God there are those few
[28:38] ruminant who remember say you know what
[28:40] we have sinen talk of Daniel in the
[28:42] Bible the Bible says in Daniel chapter
[28:46] 3 where he was praying he said God to us
[28:50] belong confusion of fces we have moved
[28:53] from the the words we have not taken
[28:55] heed to the words of your prophet amen
[28:59] and we are seeing this man repenting why
[29:01] was he repenting because the presence of
[29:05] God had moved from
[29:08] Israelite and the Bible tells us in
[29:10] Daniel's prayer that the very day
[29:12] started praying when Gabriel came down
[29:15] he told him the V started praying God
[29:18] send
[29:20] me amen but before Danel started to pray
[29:24] the Angels were at
[29:27] ease
[29:30] before the church starts to pray the
[29:33] angel they
[29:36] at before the Christians start to pray
[29:40] everything is at ease in fact even
[29:43] demons are at
[29:47] EAS but the moment the Christian start
[29:51] to pray
[29:53] hallelujah amen when the church starts
[29:57] to pray
[29:58] meetings starts in heaven conferen and
[30:02] conferences amen angels are called from
[30:06] different department because there are
[30:08] some few people in on Earth amen who are
[30:12] seeking for God's
[30:15] Direction blessed be the name of the
[30:19] Lord so you better start praying now
[30:23] amen you better keep on your knees
[30:27] blessed be the name name of the Lord
[30:29] when Anna was Barren she knew the only
[30:32] thing that could help her was the
[30:34] presence of God she never went start
[30:38] speaking
[30:43] around is after me
[30:48] no two three months without a baby you
[30:52] start you are scared one year I think my
[30:56] auntie I remember that very day even the
[30:58] words she spoke I still remember
[31:03] them I remember the uh my grandmother's
[31:08] uh children will not and who told you
[31:12] brother go in the presence of God start
[31:16] to pray and something is going to take
[31:19] place blessed be the name of the Lord
[31:23] these people they knew where the secret
[31:25] was it was because they were reading the
[31:31] word when a Christian is reading the
[31:34] word the word will always direct him to
[31:37] the right
[31:39] place even when trouble even when
[31:42] problem comes you will not have second
[31:45] alternative but as long as Plan B is
[31:48] there nothing will
[31:51] happen so she knew the only way I can
[31:54] con do you know that you can even
[31:56] convince God In Prayer
[31:59] yes
[32:01] sir bre let me tell you the God we are
[32:05] serving is God do you know that God has
[32:08] even listened to the prayers of
[32:10] demon have ever thought of
[32:13] that
[32:15] yes he has ever answered the prayers of
[32:19] demons they ask him oh Master why have
[32:22] you come this to us before our time
[32:24] please please do not chase us to at
[32:27] least allow us go in those Hogs then he
[32:30] answered that prayers then they went in
[32:32] Hogs and the Hogs all went into the sea
[32:37] if God could hear the prayer of demons
[32:40] how about a
[32:42] Believer who is under the blood of
[32:45] Jesus Amen if you could answer those the
[32:48] prayer of those who are under the blood
[32:50] of gods and Bs how much more those who
[32:54] are Redeemed by the blood of Jesus
[32:56] Christ
[32:58] so she went in the presence of God
[33:01] because that is where the answer
[33:06] was and then she started it was just
[33:09] like God you
[33:11] up she comes today Builders know
[33:16] this most time like I do work with
[33:22] Builders they go back tomorrow like
[33:25] seven coures that's how it happens even
[33:28] in spiritual
[33:29] real you come and you build the first
[33:32] one when God as long as God allows you
[33:35] to put the First Foundation brother you
[33:37] know the house is
[33:40] finished make sure that that ground the
[33:44] foundation is put on the right uh uh
[33:47] like you are building on the right
[33:48] foundation when he accepts you and you
[33:51] start just though it is a finished work
[33:54] she started praying interceding because
[33:57] she knew when the presence of God comes
[34:00] here the story will
[34:03] change and because she was building that
[34:06] one day I don't whether it was morning
[34:09] or
[34:10] evening she was there busy that day it
[34:13] was massive she
[34:16] prayed she cried until she ran out of
[34:22] words so the priest came and fall the
[34:27] Bible say her lips was
[34:30] just she could even she was groaning in
[34:34] spirit but the presence of God was there
[34:39] and that was her
[34:43] day I'm I'm not even sure whether the
[34:45] priest knew what he was talking about
[34:48] because this priest was already called
[34:51] priest L
[34:56] priest but to remember character is made
[35:01] in prayer and also through the things we
[35:03] are going through because if this sister
[35:07] if she not have that character make we
[35:09] say now see what kind of priest are you
[35:12] do I look to be drunk are you laughing
[35:14] at me no that was not so with
[35:19] Anna but God used the PRI and said next
[35:23] year in such and such a time you're
[35:26] going to have a baby and it was and
[35:29] Samuel was born because the mother was
[35:32] in the presence of God so there is such
[35:35] a great thing to be in the presence of
[35:38] God
[35:42] Amen praise be to
[35:45] God may God keep us in his
[35:49] presence and here where we read we are
[35:51] seeing Moses is saying something because
[35:54] with Isaiah after now look look here
[35:58] after had worked on
[36:00] Isaiah he not say that you go for us
[36:03] uhuh you must be willing to serve you
[36:06] must be willing to go even when after
[36:10] the angel worked on Isaiah with that
[36:13] fire that clothing tongue from the
[36:18] altar God did not tell I said now you
[36:21] have been working now okay you can go he
[36:23] still ask who will go for us blessed be
[36:27] the the name of the Lord but because
[36:29] there was a man who was tuned God was so
[36:32] sure that Isaiah was going to answer
[36:35] that call amen Lord speak my Lord and I
[36:40] will quick to answer the when the call
[36:44] of fire touched the lips of the
[36:47] Prophet
[36:50] amen before Isaiah was
[36:53] sent something had to be done in his
[36:56] life first
[36:58] before a Believer is sent you must first
[37:01] meet God face to face like
[37:05] Moses that is the true witness you have
[37:08] met God you have spoken to God Amen what
[37:12] we are talking about this is not
[37:15] feelings this is not just
[37:19] presuming you must be
[37:22] sure in our Christian work brother you
[37:25] must be sure of where you are standing
[37:28] standing you must have something
[37:31] tangible that you have apprehended and
[37:34] you know you are clinging that's what we
[37:37] call the
[37:38] anchor the Anor is not just a word no
[37:43] sir when the aner is cast and is holding
[37:47] in Christ there you know where you are
[37:52] going God will never ever trust us until
[37:56] our anchor is holding into him blessed
[38:00] be the name of the
[38:02] Lord that's the only thing the only
[38:05] thingin line that makes difference in
[38:07] Christianity is people who know they are
[38:11] God we are in pentecostes we used to
[38:14] hear about
[38:16] God we used to worship like the way we
[38:18] worship you clap your hands you sing you
[38:21] cry you shout was not
[38:26] it
[38:28] because some even after shouting they go
[38:31] and
[38:34] fornicate after struggling and breaking
[38:36] shairs in the church then you find them
[38:38] stealing neighbors
[38:45] goat after jumping and jumping and
[38:48] jumping and even until even the clothes
[38:50] are what you find them cutting neighbors
[38:55] banana so still that is not
[38:59] but there are people amen the one whom
[39:02] we sing whose heart are all a
[39:06] flame not that their heart are within
[39:09] the flame no it is that heart which is
[39:12] all a flame in other words that heart is
[39:15] a flame
[39:18] itself brother Adam talks about a stream
[39:22] one time he was somewhere and so uh a
[39:25] stream all of us we know as stre
[39:28] and like it the water like bubbling and
[39:31] and then he was he was asking it but
[39:34] what makes you bubble like that what
[39:37] makes you and he says if that spring
[39:40] could speak it would have told him that
[39:42] even me I don't know but there is
[39:44] something within me that makes me
[39:47] Bubble amen that is the life of a
[39:50] Christian who is in Christ Jesus the
[39:54] force comes within you even when you
[39:56] don't want to do something you just
[39:59] realize you cannot like forego it even
[40:03] when you feel like I don't want to go to
[40:05] church I'm
[40:07] tired by the time you realize the person
[40:10] who who had sat on the bed who was
[40:12] planning to sleep you approaching agenda
[40:16] say to one it's because there is
[40:19] something there is that presence in your
[40:22] life
[40:24] brother this presence does not come by
[40:26] ising eating portion and beans eating
[40:29] chicken eating liver it comes through
[40:32] prayer reading the word pray first
[40:40] amen when did you last dream like have a
[40:52] spiritual Joel tells us in the last days
[40:56] he will SP upon all all those as long as
[41:00] your flesh he will pour His Spirit upon
[41:03] you the young
[41:05] men they will see Visions the old men
[41:09] they will dream dreams even upon the
[41:12] don't that God I want to dream I want to
[41:14] dream no that's not it eat the word
[41:18] listen to the message
[41:21] sometime you listen to the message until
[41:24] you get it drunk and you find yourself
[41:29] seated yes sir it has happened to me
[41:32] several
[41:33] times it's not that I'm there like
[41:37] literally but it's because I have
[41:39] listened to it until it's like I'm I've
[41:42] become see the right thing read the word
[41:45] pray prepare yourself the reason as why
[41:49] we don't see these things is because we
[41:51] are not
[41:54] prepared
[41:56] amen
[41:59] sometime we think that preparation is
[42:01] supposed all to be done at church
[42:04] only was your
[42:07] clothes
[42:18] Brothers he told them wash your
[42:22] clothes wash your
[42:24] souls do not come close to your women
[42:29] because the holy God was
[42:32] coming but sometime you come the church
[42:35] without repentance you know have strayed
[42:37] there you've not put yourself right you
[42:40] just
[42:41] come it's because you are lacking that
[42:44] presence amen blessed be that Moses said
[42:48] in Exodus 3 3:13 I found Grace in thy
[42:51] sight show me now thy way that is a
[42:55] prayer for every believer
[42:58] you must reach that point where you are
[43:00] when you find you not sure whether you
[43:03] are saved whether you are serving God
[43:05] whether you are Christian even our
[43:07] prophet of this age he told God I want
[43:10] to see
[43:14] you Moses wanted confirmation you
[43:18] remember when brother bham uh when he he
[43:20] he when he spoke that lie where when
[43:24] they called him and then he ran out and
[43:26] told the word wife that received that
[43:28] and tell them that I'm not in the
[43:31] house and when he went to pray for that
[43:34] girl who was sick and God told God
[43:37] rebuked him and when the prophet went to
[43:40] put himself right with God he prayed and
[43:42] he told God please show me a sign that
[43:45] you are
[43:48] forgiven it is very very important in
[43:51] our
[43:55] life we have to reach that
[43:59] point where you are so
[44:02] sure the reason asked why we still lie
[44:06] you just Le it's okay we
[44:10] R we cheat we are lazy in prayer we
[44:15] don't even want to sing it's because we
[44:19] are not
[44:21] sure the other day I was reading the
[44:24] message the first message in the table
[44:27] which he
[44:29] says faith is the substance I had read
[44:32] it and read but this time
[44:34] round it's like I saw it in another
[44:38] version brother Bram when he started
[44:41] explaining those senses one by
[44:45] one he says that when the sense of
[44:49] smell it smells
[44:51] something even if when it's not
[44:56] there you will not you cannot convince
[44:58] that it's not
[45:00] there when you smell a
[45:04] ships you cannot convince yourself
[45:07] there's no they flying ships within him
[45:10] because your s and St it is there and
[45:12] indeed it is there
[45:15] somewhere when your eyes have seen
[45:17] something
[45:20] amen you cannot convince that you have
[45:23] not seen that you have seen nothing
[45:28] and that's what we Christian we
[45:30] need the message having the books the
[45:33] courot and the what no but we must be
[45:37] sure you see if you read that uh that
[45:41] message I I think the message the word
[45:43] became flesh the one which the prophet
[45:45] preached in India when he went there
[45:48] those Hindus told them they knew he had
[45:51] to prove to them that what is written
[45:55] here what I have you have the Bible I
[45:58] have yes but for me I have the life or
[46:02] what is written here I can display it
[46:06] and that's what made
[46:08] difference amen so we Believers brethren
[46:13] we must be
[46:15] sure about God at least he has spoken to
[46:19] you at
[46:21] least
[46:25] yes okay for example if uh let's say a
[46:30] wife is entirely leaning on the
[46:34] husband my husband is a preacher or is a
[46:39] minister or is a with
[46:41] that when the husband sings and she
[46:44] enters the spirit then she cry
[46:46] Hallelujah but here something happens
[46:49] and the husband is
[46:51] taken if that
[46:54] sister is not sure where she is
[46:59] standing has been for years you have
[47:03] taken so you have your have your faith
[47:07] go but if she knows where she's standing
[47:11] and she knows that all things work
[47:13] together for good she will still
[47:17] stand amen because she had
[47:21] that but bam tells us here let me read
[47:24] some quotes here
[47:30] uh that uh in the message in his
[47:32] presence he say that I think man
[47:34] recognizes themselves to be Sinners and
[47:36] we may feel prity pretty good when we
[47:39] are out different places and feel like
[47:43] that we are we are pretty good but we
[47:46] never come in the presence of God then
[47:48] we see how
[47:55] we it is the
[47:58] power until you are paralyzed in his
[48:02] presence you will always remember
[48:07] you in such a holy
[48:12] fear and you them away from there away
[48:17] from his
[48:19] presence he begin to St with them
[48:24] amen you see what the devil did
[48:27] the
[48:31] devil to
[48:33] them they were not with
[48:36] Jesus
[48:39] and the storm
[48:44] Rose they went off without him and that
[48:48] is the devil's opportunity to start on a
[48:52] man that's why Church the dev we need
[48:57] that presence always to be here and we
[49:00] have to be so cautious about that
[49:03] presence and we have to be so jealous
[49:06] not to drive that presence
[49:12] away we are to be so careful not working
[49:16] it out by ourself but us fulfilling our
[49:21] responsibility amen because the Bible
[49:24] tells us we should not grow geve the
[49:27] spirit of
[49:29] Christ for we are SE until the day of
[49:32] our
[49:33] Redemption
[49:35] te went off without him there there was
[49:39] toast about and they didn't know what
[49:42] way to
[49:44] go the OES were break the Sheep was
[49:48] water
[49:50] loed and they had nowhere to get away
[49:53] from the power of
[49:55] Saturn that
[49:57] was crashing in on them
[50:05] amen and when you come to the you are
[50:08] never the same anymore a man that is
[50:11] that is what we need let that come in
[50:14] our life that is going to change
[50:18] us amen where men will be real men women
[50:23] real women ministers real minister
[50:28] amen we need that
[50:32] presence in the old test they were ston
[50:35] to
[50:37] death you go lie with a beast you are
[50:40] gone case why you want to drive the Pres
[50:43] of God go commit adultery Stone to
[50:48] death and the prophet tells that
[50:50] physical death is even much better than
[50:52] spiritual
[50:55] death because when you you die
[50:57] spiritually you are disconnected forever
[50:59] from
[51:02] God blessed be the name of the Lord and
[51:05] somewh say that your
[51:08] action our
[51:11] action God kick us
[51:13] out and have that mentality for us those
[51:17] for new those but if he for near you you
[51:20] will be mindful about your
[51:24] behaviors PR this is does not mean
[51:27] wallowing in
[51:28] sin compromising with the word here and
[51:34] there the same
[51:38] God my husband loves me you are running
[51:40] with other men my husband loves me you
[51:43] are doing this and that you are deceived

[51:58] brother is
[52:01] crying be
[52:05] careful the presence of God it brings
[52:09] holy
[52:12] fear and that Holy fear will break a
[52:15] stub heart it will m a a stone heart
[52:21] when that presence moves
[52:24] amen it will break that stone your heart
[52:27] say God break me God melt me search me
[52:32] Lord help
[52:34] me amen when the word is preached the
[52:38] Holy Ghost move looking for who is
[52:44] ready you come to church put your phone
[52:47] on
[52:48] vibration every message that comes in
[52:51] you want to check you are not in the
[52:54] presence of God you are in the presence
[52:57] of
[53:03] Technology there are things which the
[53:05] Bible tells you that even nature itself
[53:08] teaches
[53:09] you so there are also things that we can
[53:11] say that a Believer a serious believer
[53:15] you know you don't need to be told that
[53:18] put off your
[53:21] phones I don't know whether they are
[53:23] here I'm just preaching because that's
[53:25] what God puts in my heart
[53:33] amen the presence of God will always
[53:36] tell you
[53:39] that and we are looking we are longing
[53:42] to be
[53:44] there but B I'm sometime in the meeting
[53:46] there where I read where he says that
[53:49] like as where that quietness where the
[53:51] presence of God was moving and he say
[53:54] that there was such a quietness that
[53:58] even if someone just drops a be behind
[54:04] hear
[54:05] Brethren let us ask for more of God when
[54:10] God will start not
[54:13] struggle church will be uncomfortable
[54:16] for some
[54:19] people
[54:24] amen people will find their places
[54:28] whether your plac is in the church or it
[54:30] is in the
[54:33] nightclub or in the church or in the
[54:35] Catholic
[54:39] ches so what we need is the presence of
[54:44] God it is such an important
[54:48] thing when that presence came to where
[54:51] Lazarus was in four days journey amen
[54:56] our presence called the man who was dead
[54:59] for 4 days and the man came back to
[55:03] life there was a man who died and his
[55:06] body was thrown where Elijah was bured
[55:09] was
[55:10] elishah and that presence
[55:13] broke the Bor of the of the Prophet oh
[55:18] God when you die when you anointed even
[55:21] your skeleton will be
[55:23] anointed blessed be the name of the Lord
[55:27] no in the day of Resurrection amen
[55:30] because already you have that
[55:35] that when they might M they will come
[55:38] there amen those elements that forms
[55:41] your body will start working on
[55:44] themselves blessed be the name of the
[55:46] Lord that's why we need the presence of
[55:51] God Moses knew that without the presence
[55:54] of God they cannot fight any battle they
[55:57] will be pray to their enemies so he told
[56:00] God unless you are going with us and
[56:03] when God said that that was not enough
[56:06] God told Moses okay now for you to be
[56:08] very to be so sure I'm going to walk you
[56:11] will see me you will see my
[56:14] back blessed be the name of the Lord
[56:17] that same God when when was coming to us
[56:21] he changed his dress wear and put on the
[56:24] body Jesus the very God said that heaven
[56:28] God it pleased him to dwell in your
[56:32] heart that is where he want to D
[56:36] well and that's why we are here we want
[56:39] God in our
[56:41] heart walking when we are sure that God
[56:45] is in the Throne of my
[56:47] heart that's when All Things become
[56:51] possible shall we stand on our
[56:54] feet amen
[56:58] he says in this message in this presence
[57:00] he says that then when comes in his
[57:03] presence when a man once comes the
[57:05] presence of God he's changed forever if
[57:09] there is any changing to him now there
[57:12] are at those who could walk in the
[57:14] presence of God and pay no attention to
[57:17] it it wasn't ordained to life but if he
[57:20] was predestinated of God as soon as that
[57:25] F that catches
[57:27] fire when you are predestinated to this
[57:31] blessed be the name of the
[57:33] Lord as soon as it is that thing that
[57:37] catches the
[57:39] fire blessed be the name of the
[57:42] Lord amen how many need this
[57:46] presence he is here amen because the
[57:50] Bible says it's God who follows his word
[57:53] to fulfill
[57:54] it when he say his word he must fulfill
[57:58] it Brethren there is something about the
[58:02] presence of God and the presence of God
[58:05] is nothing other than the New Birth the
[58:07] Holy Spirit look at the statch of the
[58:11] perfect man from Faith to love which is
[58:14] the cupstone how are you going to obtain
[58:16] those things without the presence of God
[58:19] but when you receive the Holy Ghost amen
[58:22] and you are baptized in that body you
[58:25] start to grow in that sture blessed be
[58:29] the name of the Lord and is that
[58:31] presence driving us that
[58:35] direction may God help us if you can
[58:38] make it a point this year and say God
[58:41] each one of us you must make a
[58:43] resolution God enough is enough I must
[58:47] be
[58:48] sure I remember one day I came here I
[58:51] had my body in my heart I said God today
[58:54] I need something at least
[58:57] that I I need something unusual or
[59:01] supernational I came here we
[59:04] prayed uh that day Pastor requested me
[59:06] to
[59:07] speak and after I was just kneeling here
[59:11] and I was praying I came
[59:13] and I had a very heavy hand on my head
[59:17] like this my head became so heavy I was
[59:21] trying to lift it up and I could not and
[59:24] I could feel like a human
[59:27] hand and I can't explain that but at
[59:31] least I say God I still need more of
[59:35] this so God is
[59:38] real God is true God keeps his
[59:43] word God
[59:46] speaks one day one brother was telling
[59:48] us how one day one brother was telling
[59:50] us how the angel visited him and he was
[59:52] like I told him brother let us keep
[59:55] pressing on
[59:57] own these things does not mean that we
[1:00:00] are special we are better no these are
[1:00:04] our daily daily food because he is our
[1:00:08] father when your father buys you a book
[1:00:11] it doesn't mean that you are better than
