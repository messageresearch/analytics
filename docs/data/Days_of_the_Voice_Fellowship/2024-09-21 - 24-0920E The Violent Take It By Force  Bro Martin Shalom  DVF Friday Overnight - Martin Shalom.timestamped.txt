[1:01:50] God so you must take a
[1:01:52] step because it is the violin that take
[1:01:56] it by force
[1:01:57] amen praise be to God uh as I was
[1:02:01] praying here this evening this thought
[1:02:04] came to
[1:02:06] me and I believe because I was wondering
[1:02:09] I said God what what are we going to
[1:02:11] share always I always tell it's my
[1:02:13] hardest time each time they tell me that
[1:02:16] brother you are standing today it
[1:02:18] becomes a Tagle for but as I was praying
[1:02:21] and waiting on
[1:02:23] God this scripture came to me blessed be
[1:02:26] the name of the Lord and when I went in
[1:02:30] uh reading it and
[1:02:33] also reading some
[1:02:36] quotes uh my heart was contented that
[1:02:39] God wanted me to speak about this and if
[1:02:43] you just give me your undivided
[1:02:45] attention I believe the Lord will speak
[1:02:47] to you blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:02:50] because we are living in the time we are
[1:02:53] living in perilous time we are living in
[1:02:56] challenging moments blessed be the name
[1:02:59] of the Lord amen if you read the message
[1:03:04] if you read uh the Bible you realize
[1:03:08] that the time we are living
[1:03:12] in and only what is going to keep us
[1:03:15] moving is to keep ourself closed in the
[1:03:20] word is to keep ourself on our knees
[1:03:24] blessed be the name of the Lord because
[1:03:26] we realize that even Christian we are
[1:03:28] losing our ground if we are not careful
[1:03:31] one time we shared here about be about
[1:03:35] uh being drifted without knowing praise
[1:03:38] be to God this thing comes little by
[1:03:42] little and by the time you
[1:03:45] realize you are behaving in a
[1:03:47] contradicting way but before you
[1:03:51] realize a Believer is abusing someone
[1:03:56] before you realize you have hot temper
[1:04:00] amen before you
[1:04:02] realize when time for sleeping come you
[1:04:05] just enter in your
[1:04:08] bed you come back when you are tired and
[1:04:10] you forget about family altar blessed be
[1:04:14] the name of the Lord but I'm here to
[1:04:16] remind my brothers and my
[1:04:19] sister that the kingdom of God is taken
[1:04:23] by force
[1:04:26] right way back from the patriarch amen
[1:04:29] there is nobody who received God's
[1:04:31] blessing on Silver
[1:04:33] Plate they had to fight for it they had
[1:04:37] to wrestle to get it
[1:04:40] amen it is through God promised look at
[1:04:44] the promised land when God brought them
[1:04:47] out of the bondage and he led them the
[1:04:50] promised land still they had to fight
[1:04:53] for that land blessed be the name of the
[1:04:56] Lord even when they were in Egypt there
[1:04:59] are those few who knew the promise of
[1:05:04] God and according to the message of the
[1:05:07] hour the prophet tells us that Moses's
[1:05:10] father every evening would go up in the
[1:05:13] upper chamber to pray because he knew
[1:05:15] the promise that God had given them the
[1:05:18] promise that one day he would bring them
[1:05:22] out of Egypt blessed be the name of the
[1:05:25] Lord
[1:05:27] amen and every time he used every
[1:05:30] evening and maybe every morning he would
[1:05:33] pray God remember your word god remember
[1:05:37] your promise God you say you spoke to
[1:05:40] our father amen that after this period
[1:05:44] you would bring us out blessed be the
[1:05:46] name of the Lord so I'm here to tell you
[1:05:49] that is the violent that take it by
[1:05:52] force
[1:05:57] some think that they are going to
[1:05:59] receive the Holy
[1:06:00] Spirit just on Silver
[1:06:03] Plate it is true God gave out the Holy
[1:06:06] Ghost but you must do
[1:06:11] something there is some little sacrifice
[1:06:13] you must
[1:06:16] do praise be to
[1:06:18] God you must live under expectation
[1:06:22] every
[1:06:23] time sometime we come to church just
[1:06:28] overnight overnight you come and sit you
[1:06:31] go back the same you come and little
[1:06:33] suay today is Sunday let us go you come
[1:06:36] sit you go back this today is Easter
[1:06:39] today is the Lord's
[1:06:41] Supper there is something Beyond just
[1:06:45] enjoying the Lord's
[1:06:48] Supper praise be to
[1:06:50] God we are Covenant
[1:06:53] people we have the promise of God for
[1:06:58] us amen and another thing we are in the
[1:07:02] battle blessed be the name of the
[1:07:05] Lord each time we come
[1:07:12] here praise the Lord every time you come
[1:07:15] in a service like this you have come to
[1:07:18] make your enemy you have come to chase
[1:07:21] your enemy you've come to command it off
[1:07:24] your territory praise be to God and you
[1:07:27] must take a stand of
[1:07:30] Faith because the Bible says whoever
[1:07:33] comes God Must Believe first and I
[1:07:36] believe I'm speaking to Believers
[1:07:37] tonight that God is that he is here amen
[1:07:42] because he say that there sever two or
[1:07:45] three gathers in his name he will come
[1:07:47] and be in our midst after knowing that
[1:07:50] God is in our
[1:07:52] midst then you come believing knowing
[1:07:56] that he's going to reward your sacrifice
[1:07:59] he's going to reward your
[1:08:02] effort blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:08:06] that encourages us to know that God is
[1:08:10] in our
[1:08:11] midst and God being in our midst is not
[1:08:14] enough you must provoke that God by your
[1:08:19] faith praise be to
[1:08:21] God he no longer want to be Emmanuel God
[1:08:24] With Us
[1:08:26] but now God want to be in
[1:08:30] us God will be much more effective when
[1:08:33] is in us than with us God was with Judah
[1:08:38] do you know
[1:08:39] that God walked with
[1:08:43] Judas he went with Judas they cast out
[1:08:47] demons with Judas but God was not in
[1:08:51] Judah blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:08:54] and what maketh difference
[1:08:56] is God being in us because when God is
[1:09:00] in us then we are sealed in the kingdom
[1:09:02] of God that's when we say that we are
[1:09:05] marked we are
[1:09:07] sealed and that's when we are not shaken
[1:09:11] that's when we can stand and say the
[1:09:13] anchor
[1:09:15] hold blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:09:18] Christ want to be in us because he knows
[1:09:22] that we cannot fight this battle alone
[1:09:25] praise be to
[1:09:27] God the reason asked why many are
[1:09:31] quitting it is because they have been
[1:09:33] walking with Jesus but Jesus want to be
[1:09:37] in US praise be to
[1:09:40] God someone believes the message for 30
[1:09:43] 40 years then he wakes up in the morning
[1:09:46] and say ah I didn't know that
[1:09:49] message then you wonder you've been
[1:09:51] preaching it for the last 40 years
[1:09:57] in fact if I reach that part say just
[1:09:59] God just take me
[1:10:00] home you become a bigger stumbling
[1:10:04] block praise be to God where is the
[1:10:07] problem it is because they have been
[1:10:10] walking with
[1:10:12] Christ but Christ want to be in US amen
[1:10:17] that's why Jesus told the disciple go t
[1:10:21] ye in the
[1:10:22] Jerusalem T in the upper room and till
[1:10:25] the day of
[1:10:27] Pentecost praise be to
[1:10:29] God
[1:10:31] Amen and for the 10 days these men were
[1:10:35] not eating chicken and
[1:10:37] chips no
[1:10:40] sir they are not on the football
[1:10:43] Beach because remember when they Walking
[1:10:46] With
[1:10:49] Jesus they looked at them as hopeless
[1:10:53] people as crazy
[1:10:55] as people who had nothing to
[1:10:58] do they were unlearned to begin with
[1:11:02] they were ignorant
[1:11:05] men praise be to
[1:11:08] God so there are people whom the world
[1:11:10] was not even worthy they are not even
[1:11:15] worthy and Jesus who was giving this
[1:11:18] man's Vibe he was taken away from
[1:11:22] them praise be to God
[1:11:26] and I
[1:11:27] believe even
[1:11:29] them what shall we do now after all the
[1:11:33] man who gave us hope is also
[1:11:36] taken he's killed blessed be the name of
[1:11:39] the Lord praise the Lord but because
[1:11:44] these people they had the seed of God in
[1:11:46] them there was something telling them
[1:11:49] amen there was a beace within their
[1:11:52] heart telling them that this man he was
[1:11:55] not an ordinary man
[1:11:58] amen maybe they reminded Peter and asked
[1:12:01] and told him do you remember when he
[1:12:03] said that blood and flesh did not reveal
[1:12:06] that to you but my father who is in
[1:12:09] heaven praise me to God that is
[1:12:13] something somebody has ever been with
[1:12:15] Jesus is much much different with
[1:12:17] someone who has never tested
[1:12:22] Jesus praise the Lord
[1:12:26] his conversation will be
[1:12:30] different his action will be different
[1:12:34] amen the way he talks the way he walks
[1:12:39] the way he approaches matters will be
[1:12:41] different why because he has been with
[1:12:44] Jesus who was the great counselor
[1:12:47] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:12:50] amen but this man somehow something
[1:12:54] pushed them
[1:12:55] and told but remember he
[1:12:59] said they were maybe pray in fact the
[1:13:02] Bible say they were praying amen they
[1:13:05] were waiting on God hallelujah they were
[1:13:09] waiting for the
[1:13:11] promise they knew that the violent shall
[1:13:14] take it's the violent who take it by
[1:13:20] force even Mary never say that for me
[1:13:22] I'm the mother of Jesus I produce you
[1:13:31] oh not with the Mary the mother of Jesus
[1:13:35] blessed be the name of the
[1:13:38] Lord maybe Mary had that you know the
[1:13:41] devil always come with such
[1:13:43] thought maybe sometimes mayy would see
[1:13:47] that Jesus was going
[1:13:49] overboard maybe the devil would whisper
[1:13:53] to her but you don't need to you don't
[1:13:55] need to fast so to restle so much after
[1:13:58] all you are the one who carried the baby
[1:14:00] in your womb if at all is the Lord is
[1:14:02] the savior yes he will he will redeem
[1:14:05] you anyhow not with Mary blessed be the
[1:14:08] name of the
[1:14:09] Lord amen she had to struggle to go and
[1:14:14] wait in the upper
[1:14:17] room and from that time until today
[1:14:21] remember that we are the ACT we are the
[1:14:24] uh the book of the continuation of the
[1:14:26] book of Acts the same same way the same
[1:14:30] same approach we must follow the same
[1:14:34] approach during the time of Daniel they
[1:14:37] had the promise of their Liberation
[1:14:40] blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:14:42] Daniel tells us that by the number of
[1:14:44] books he knew that 70 years was close
[1:14:48] and what did he do he went to seek God
[1:14:52] In Prayer fasting supp ation confession
[1:14:58] amen why because he knew that the
[1:15:00] promise which God gave them was about to
[1:15:03] come to
[1:15:05] pass I'm here to remind you my brothers
[1:15:07] that we must do something about this
[1:15:10] message we must do something about the
[1:15:13] promise of God In Our Last
[1:15:17] Days amen we must prepare
[1:15:21] ourself blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:15:26] the moment the engagement has been
[1:15:29] announced preparation
[1:15:35] begins brother
[1:15:37] Alan is that
[1:15:41] true
[1:15:46] amen
[1:15:48] Jesus the groom and the church the
[1:15:52] bride Jesus already started a
[1:15:54] preparation
[1:15:55] he said I'm going to the father I'm
[1:15:57] going to prepare for you a
[1:16:00] place amen way back when Jesus was on
[1:16:04] the cross when he was pierced on the
[1:16:07] side where we came
[1:16:10] out preparation
[1:16:12] started and from that time until today
[1:16:16] the preparation is going on Amen Jesus
[1:16:20] is ready to receive you and me are you
[1:16:24] ready to go
[1:16:26] are you prepared to
[1:16:28] go blessed be the name of the
[1:16:35] Lord preparing for us a place you must
[1:16:39] do
[1:16:42] something blessed be the name of the
[1:16:44] Lord because the Bible tells us there
[1:16:46] are those guys who never kept their
[1:16:49] places and they were cursed in outer
[1:16:52] Darkness you think they will just leave
[1:16:55] you to
[1:16:58] go those Fallen Angels who were once
[1:17:02] there who enjoyed what is there amen who
[1:17:06] enjoyed the presence of God who enjoyed
[1:17:09] that light
[1:17:10] there and because they never kept their
[1:17:14] places the bible say that they were cast
[1:17:17] in outer Darkness they in Chains and
[1:17:21] they will not allow you to just go
[1:17:25] because they know what is
[1:17:28] there and for them already they know
[1:17:31] what is there but for us by faith amen
[1:17:36] we know that what eyes have not seen
[1:17:39] what ears have not heard amen what even
[1:17:42] has not been perceived in human mind
[1:17:45] that is what God is preparing for us
[1:17:48] there and we are going there by
[1:17:51] faith praise be to God
[1:17:56] you must go there by
[1:17:59] faith and it must be violent
[1:18:02] faith it must be rugged faith not your
[1:18:06] faith but the faith of
[1:18:08] God where the Bible says impossible for
[1:18:11] God to lie amen and we get that same
[1:18:15] scripture amen when we pray for
[1:18:18] something today and we don't re and
[1:18:21] maybe you have not received it we don't
[1:18:23] stop there I pray in the morning I've
[1:18:26] not gotten it I will go in the afternoon
[1:18:29] and I will knock at God's store I pray
[1:18:31] in the afternoon and I not go any it I
[1:18:33] will go the following day that's what
[1:18:36] God want from
[1:18:37] us that is the violent Faith amen Jesus
[1:18:43] gave us an example of that unjust
[1:18:47] judge and the Widow had her case she
[1:18:51] went there the first day the judge never
[1:18:54] even gave
[1:18:57] attention I believe they are living in
[1:18:59] the time like the time we are living in
[1:19:02] today where the judges are
[1:19:06] corrupt where the whole system is
[1:19:15] corrupt she cannot even afford
[1:19:18] lawyers praise be to God she could not
[1:19:21] afford lawyers my brothers my sisters
[1:19:26] but she feared
[1:19:28] God Amen and she knew that God would
[1:19:32] move in the heart of this judge she went
[1:19:35] there in the morning and she was not
[1:19:38] attended to she went there the following
[1:19:40] day and she was not attending to she
[1:19:43] went she never gave
[1:19:46] up amen she never gave up my
[1:19:50] brothers because the violent they will
[1:19:52] take it by force
[1:20:01] until the judge said why in fact this
[1:20:04] man knew very well himself
[1:20:09] he but let me let me judge let me handle
[1:20:14] her
[1:20:15] case and Jesus that's what God expect us
[1:20:20] to do he has a lot for us but we must do
[1:20:23] something
[1:20:27] because the Bible tells us our
[1:20:28] anniversary the devil is moving like a
[1:20:31] hungry lion looking for somebody whom he
[1:20:35] may devour who he may
[1:20:38] finish but sometime you wonder a
[1:20:41] Christian we just live
[1:20:43] anyhow we talk anyhow you even sleep
[1:20:46] without
[1:20:47] prayer but the devil is on
[1:20:53] job when hell deploys his forces they
[1:20:57] don't
[1:21:01] Slumber they must be active
[1:21:06] 24/7 but Believers many times we just
[1:21:11] say
[1:21:13] prayers but the Bible never told us to
[1:21:16] say prayers amen it tells us to pray
[1:21:20] without
[1:21:21] ceasing amen we pray every time we pray
[1:21:25] every minute we pray every hour we pray
[1:21:28] in the night in the morning in the
[1:21:30] evening amen when things are good when
[1:21:33] things are bad when things are fair when
[1:21:36] it is raining when it is shining he told
[1:21:38] us to pray without
[1:21:41] season
[1:21:44] amen whether I have money I will pray
[1:21:47] whether I've eaten I will or not I will
[1:21:50] pray amen whether I have transport or
[1:21:52] not I will pray
[1:21:56] because it is the violent that take it
[1:21:59] by force the weapon of our Warfare is
[1:22:02] not caral amen but they are
[1:22:08] spiritual we are fighting against
[1:22:11] principalities we are fighting against
[1:22:14] dominions amen we are fighting against
[1:22:18] Spirits we are fighting against
[1:22:22] habits blessed be the name of the
[1:22:26] Lord amen he say that casting down every
[1:22:30] imagination and every High thing that
[1:22:32] exal s against the knowledge of God
[1:22:36] there is no imagination there is no I
[1:22:39] thing that can exal himself against God
[1:22:43] against you against our progress against
[1:22:48] our Sexes against our families against
[1:22:51] our children he tells us we are pulling
[1:22:54] down all those
[1:22:56] imaginations they are just
[1:22:59] imaginations blessed be the name of the
[1:23:03] Lord
[1:23:05] amen bringing them into
[1:23:08] captivity every thought The Obedience of
[1:23:13] Christ every
[1:23:22] thought praise be to God
[1:23:25] and having in Readiness to aveng to
[1:23:27] Revenge all Disobedience when your
[1:23:31] disobedience is fulf when your obedience
[1:23:33] is fulfilled do you look on things after
[1:23:36] the outward appearance If any man trust
[1:23:40] to himself that he is Christ let
[1:23:49] him blessed be the name of the
[1:23:59] to God against the
[1:24:02] principalities against the powers
[1:24:05] against the rulers of Darkness of this
[1:24:10] world they are rulers of Darkness of
[1:24:12] this
[1:24:14] world which doctors
[1:24:18] Sorcerers
[1:24:19] murderers thieves
[1:24:25] praise be to God those men they are
[1:24:28] possessed by evil
[1:24:32] spirits that's why they be wishing
[1:24:37] people that's why just because of your
[1:24:40] phone someone want to murder
[1:24:42] you it is because they yielded thems to
[1:24:46] be used by evil
[1:24:48] spirits praise be to
[1:24:51] God I remember when uh when speckled
[1:24:55] shifted to
[1:24:56] Z that place where the church
[1:24:59] is thieves used to hammer people
[1:25:08] there but as we are speaking
[1:25:12] today praise be to
[1:25:15] God that little
[1:25:17] light has covered almost the entire area
[1:25:21] and even there is development and I
[1:25:23] believe it's because of the presence of
[1:25:26] God in that
[1:25:30] place praise be to God we used to pray
[1:25:34] and just behind the church there were me
[1:25:37] Muslims who used to smoke pipes
[1:25:42] there they could even
[1:25:49] [Music]
[1:25:51] speak but as I'm speaking today
[1:25:55] the church has even bow that very place
[1:25:59] it is them who did
[1:26:01] what who
[1:26:06] left praise be to
[1:26:08] God they could the demons using them
[1:26:11] could not withstand the presence of God
[1:26:14] in that
[1:26:15] place praise be to God and because of
[1:26:19] the violent faith of men and women who
[1:26:23] stood and prayed every night every
[1:26:26] morning every evening every Wednesday
[1:26:29] something happened and today they are
[1:26:32] expanding and
[1:26:34] expanding blessed be the name of the
[1:26:37] Lord that same God is the God we are
[1:26:40] serving the same word is present in our
[1:26:44] midst and the same word is putting on
[1:26:47] flesh again because Jesus said as was in
[1:26:50] his first coming shall it be in his
[1:26:53] second coming
[1:26:54] this word in his first coming this word
[1:26:56] put on flesh this word went and visited
[1:26:59] Abraham blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:27:02] and gave Abram the promise the same word
[1:27:05] as put on flesh in our generation in
[1:27:08] Malachi 4 blessed be the name of the
[1:27:11] Lord and the same word is putting on
[1:27:13] flesh even

[1:27:18] God Amen
[1:27:24] let us not leave the devil at
[1:27:30] peace we have not reach that point where
[1:27:33] we disorganize the devil until he's even
[1:27:35] knocked by his fellow
[1:27:37] demons but we have to reach that
[1:27:40] level where we disorganize the area
[1:27:43] where we are no demon will
[1:27:46] operate amen because the Shak glory is
[1:27:50] in that area because there is a believer
[1:27:54] who knows his God and is standing in
[1:27:56] that
[1:28:00] area I remember at home when we used to
[1:28:04] pray the witch doctors would not play
[1:28:07] their drums
[1:28:10] anymore
[1:28:12] and I think
[1:28:14] like so when they
[1:28:18] start then we sing there is power power
[1:28:23] Wonder King Power before even you sing
[1:28:26] two
[1:28:27] choruses there is silence in the whole
[1:28:29] sub count this whole
[1:28:32] area demons cannot
[1:28:35] operate where our True Believers
[1:28:40] are blessed be the name of the
[1:28:43] Lord and as I'm speaking today all those
[1:28:47] tring they are no longer there

[1:40:04] this it was bubbling in them already
[1:40:07] amen praise be to
[1:40:13] God some have even started admiring the
[1:40:16] GC of
[1:40:18] Egypt they even
[1:40:22] admired the graves can you
[1:40:27] imagine I think because Egyptian were
[1:40:30] specialist specialist in building or in
[1:40:32] making
[1:40:34] Graves and they say that when they they
[1:40:36] die in the wilderness they'll just maybe
[1:40:38] gather Stone and break maybe a branch of
[1:40:41] tree and make a cross and then put it
[1:40:45] there and when they remember the Tas
[1:40:47] graves in Egypt they told
[1:40:51] Moses there were no graves in Egypt
[1:40:55] eypt blessed be the name of the Lord but
[1:40:59] God always look at that man with a
[1:41:01] different
[1:41:03] spirit and that's why even in Psalm said
[1:41:05] David was after his own
[1:41:10] heart that's why even when David sinned
[1:41:13] in Psalms 51 David he knew that by faith
[1:41:16] this God will receive me and we today we
[1:41:19] are even singing his prayer
[1:41:25] when the Spy went to Egypt sorry when
[1:41:28] they went to spy the
[1:41:30] land blessed be the name of the
[1:41:34] Lord the truth is even Joshua saw the
[1:41:40] Giants because Joshua was just human
[1:41:43] being like any of us here do you think
[1:41:47] they the the 10
[1:41:54] that they had cross
[1:41:56] eyes no they had normal
[1:41:59] eyes even this one saw the giant but the
[1:42:03] difference
[1:42:04] was they had the
[1:42:09] promise blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:42:12] and they knew that if they are to take
[1:42:14] that land they're going to take it by
[1:42:18] force and that force would be coming
[1:42:20] from
[1:42:22] God not from their military
[1:42:25] training
[1:42:31] amen this
[1:42:33] man John the
[1:42:35] Baptist look at the way he
[1:42:39] preached he was filled with the Holy
[1:42:42] Ghost when he was still in the womb what
[1:42:44] do you expect to come from come out of
[1:42:48] him already was flaming sword
[1:42:54] praise be to God this man preached say
[1:42:58] until one
[1:43:07] day praise be to
[1:43:11] God but because John
[1:43:14] knew the king of God they take it by
[1:43:18] force
[1:43:24] and I believe
[1:43:26] maybe the man came even with a bodyguard
[1:43:28] because already was a Renown
[1:43:31] person and guess what before even before
[1:43:34] sitting he said but it's not lawful for
[1:43:36] you to take your brother's wife and I
