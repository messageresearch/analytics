[1:13:31] so
[1:13:33] the young people in this church I would
[1:13:34] like you to
[1:13:36] be to Avail yourself
[1:13:42] from Thursday
[1:13:45] and try and ask around whatever you can
[1:13:48] do suppose
[1:14:02] many other brothers
[1:14:03] [Music]
[1:14:06] these brothers ask them where can I be
[1:14:09] of help
[1:14:12] meanwhile we need the fans
[1:14:16] against CB you know if I think we have
[1:14:19] prepared these meetings in just uh four
[1:14:21] weeks or three less than that
[1:14:26] and uh it it looks like it is going to
[1:14:32] be more than we expected so
[1:14:37] [Music]
[1:14:38] a little time for us to be able to raise
[1:14:40] funds
[1:14:42] but our God is a Jehovah
[1:14:45] [Music]
[1:14:51] you can actually provide through us
[1:14:56] if you don't give someone else
[1:15:00] and if someone else gives the blessing
[1:15:02] we'll go to them
[1:15:05] amen so we've only pledged two millions
[1:15:08] 99 000.
[1:15:12] and not all of it a little of that is a
[1:15:15] fraction of that is pain
[1:15:19] so uh we we believe that the Lord will
[1:15:22] provide
[1:15:25] uh why don't the brothers move the
[1:15:27] offering back if you want to give
[1:15:28] something towards those youth meetings
[1:15:37] [Music]
[1:15:50] [Music]
[1:15:53] foreign
[1:15:56] [Music]
[1:16:24] [Music]
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:47] oh how sweet to walk in this liquor

[1:17:53] [Music]
[1:17:56] with my love to me
[1:18:06] [Music]
[1:18:11] said
[1:18:16] oh yes
[1:18:20] [Music]
[1:18:35] while we are standing shall return to
[1:18:37] the Book of John image
[1:18:46] how many came expecting to hear the
[1:18:48] words
[1:18:52] amen that's the uh the main service
[1:18:57] you see whatever we do in the in a
[1:19:00] church
[1:19:01] is good but the most important thing
[1:19:05] when we go to church is the preaching of
[1:19:07] the words
[1:19:11] everything you know is to what's that
[1:19:16] so let us read uh chapter one of John
[1:19:20] yokana
[1:19:24] verses 10 to 13.
[1:19:41] everybody there if you're there say Amen
[1:19:43] foreign
[1:19:50] was made by him and the world knew him
[1:19:53] not
[1:19:54] he came unto his own
[1:19:57] and his own
[1:20:00] received him not
[1:20:02] but as many as received him to them gave
[1:20:05] him power to become the sons of God even
[1:20:09] to them that believe on his name
[1:20:12] which we are born not of blood nor of
[1:20:15] the will of the flesh nor of the will of
[1:20:18] man but of God
[1:20:22] foreign
[1:20:46] [Music]
[1:20:57] foreign Amen Let us speak to him
[1:21:00] Lord Jesus we want to give this service
[1:21:03] now back to you could
[1:21:08] not be seen But when you be seen at this
[1:21:10] moment
[1:21:13] we need you Lord
[1:21:15] just come and speak to us
[1:21:18] in Jesus name
[1:21:21] amen
[1:21:24] can I have a little more sound brothers
[1:21:29] so this morning I'm speaking on the
[1:21:31] generation of Overcomers
[1:21:37] the generation of overcast
[1:21:43] amen Mina
[1:21:46] I don't know whether you believe you are
[1:21:48] a part of that generation
[1:21:52] but I believe I am
[1:21:54] a part of that generation
[1:21:58] as a matter of fact this is going to be
[1:21:59] our theme for the Youth meetings
[1:22:05] and I am really looking forward to the
[1:22:08] youth meetings
[1:22:11] I believe we shall have a marvelous time
[1:22:16] amen amen now
[1:22:19] John says that Jesus or Christ was in
[1:22:22] the world
[1:22:24] but the world was made by him yes
[1:22:32] imagine he is the one that made the
[1:22:35] world
[1:22:37] and the world he came to the world that
[1:22:39] he met but the world knew him not
[1:22:41] whatever is
[1:22:44] [Music]
[1:22:46] so some people actually say they have
[1:22:49] failed to believe because of the church
[1:22:52] where they attended
[1:22:56] I've even found people in the message
[1:22:58] comparing preacher to preacher sounds
[1:23:04] comparing churches to churches
[1:23:07] where you can do that but I don't really
[1:23:10] believe in that
[1:23:13] because I believe that as long as the
[1:23:16] word of God is being preached
[1:23:20] if you don't change the problem is not
[1:23:24] the preacher's problem
[1:23:26] the problem is yours
[1:23:28] last time we talked about the pattern of
[1:23:32] every true Ministries
[1:23:37] and we noticed that I don't want to go
[1:23:40] back into that but if you want you can
[1:23:41] go back and listen to it
[1:23:44] so as long as you are safe
[1:23:47] a true God
[1:23:49] Living Ministries
[1:23:54] because a true Minister
[1:23:57] will be true to the world
[1:24:00] he will never deviate from the world
[1:24:03] he will never bring or bridge to you
[1:24:05] something else other than what the word
[1:24:07] says
[1:24:12] will always yield himself the spirit
[1:24:15] amen a true Minister will not be sent by
[1:24:19] man but he will be sent by God
[1:24:23] as long as you are sitting under a true
[1:24:25] Ministry
[1:24:28] it's not about the stature of a man
[1:24:31] it's not about the ability of the man
[1:24:36] it's not even about how many people
[1:24:38] attend at the church where you go
[1:24:43] how much things
[1:24:46] whether you have a full band or you have
[1:24:48] nothing foreign
[1:25:03] [Music]
[1:25:15] [Music]
[1:25:22] [Music]
[1:25:49] then we also had some brothers they
[1:25:53] tried to devise some means of getting
[1:25:54] some musical instruments
[1:25:58] so they went to this old uh metallic
[1:26:02] bottles
[1:26:04] put some holes in it
[1:26:06] put some Stones
[1:26:16] [Music]
[1:26:18] that's where we were changed
[1:26:22] in such Services that's where we met God
[1:26:25] [Music]
[1:26:26] and I want to encourage you tonight
[1:26:29] but as long as you are sitting under the
[1:26:32] true word of God
[1:26:35] God will always meet you there
[1:26:38] and you must always overcome
[1:26:41] regardless of what you're fighting since
[1:26:45] Jesus was God yes
[1:26:50] and God came in the world that he
[1:26:52] himself had created
[1:26:56] but the world did not know him
[1:26:59] the Bible says he came to his own Bible
[1:27:03] but his own received him
[1:27:06] so in other words whenever you come to a
[1:27:09] service
[1:27:10] you know the Lord is coming to speak to
[1:27:13] you
[1:27:14] listen this is not me that you know or
[1:27:17] the brother to know that is speaking to
[1:27:19] you from this time
[1:27:22] we give the service to him
[1:27:25] and we have asked him to come and speak
[1:27:27] to us
[1:27:29] so we believe is now at this time
[1:27:31] speaking to us through his words
[1:27:36] how many will receive him
[1:27:39] receive him in our generation
[1:28:28] [Music]
[1:28:41] foreign gone by God doesn't give birth
[1:28:44] but here the Bible says otherwise
[1:28:48] the Bible says as many as received Jesus
[1:28:51] Christ
[1:28:53] how many have received him here
[1:28:56] the Bible says
[1:29:03] he has given you the right
[1:29:06] be a Son of God
[1:29:11] someone says God has no children
[1:29:15] I will tell them your son left look at
[1:29:18] me
[1:29:22] even to them that believe in his name is
[1:29:42] are born by our mothers our fathers they
[1:29:44] never even ever said that was the that
[1:29:48] was a blood now
[1:29:51] because the will of a man
[1:29:54] tells according to the last of the flesh
[1:30:02] for us to be born again foreign
[1:30:42] foreign
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:31:13] because he died for all we know that he
[1:31:16] died for all but to those that he
[1:31:18] received that receive him he gave them a
[1:31:20] promise of adoption
[1:31:26] one of those who received him he gave
[1:31:29] them power to be the sons of God
[1:31:33] when he receive him you have promises
[1:31:35] from him listen to this when he receive
[1:31:38] him the moment he receive him
[1:31:41] he gives you promises
[1:31:44] that will never failure
[1:32:47] how can we fail to our
[1:33:03] a promise that he has given me because
[1:33:06] of receiving him
[1:33:10] then I know that I am going to be a part
[1:33:12] of the Overcomers
[1:33:21] I'm gonna take a quote here and then
[1:33:23] we'll we'll go to study a little bit of
[1:33:25] what happened in the desert
[1:33:32] I want us to look at this brother says
[1:33:34] and remember that
[1:33:36] the reproach of the word the word has
[1:33:38] always bore a reproach
[1:33:43] all through the edges
[1:33:46] God is Anointed words
[1:34:02] you are going to be reproached
[1:34:37] [Applause]
[1:35:05] what this is
[1:35:08] let me begin that way
[1:35:12] to live as a Christian
[1:35:15] if you don't understand what
[1:35:18] is
[1:35:20] but if you understand what is in here
[1:35:23] to be a Christian you will not be an
[1:35:26] effort on your part of Christ
[1:35:30] will not fight to overcome
[1:35:33] because you will know that is one that
[1:35:36] has overcome for you
[1:35:42] and say here is where I stand
[1:35:47] on the world
[1:35:48] then you will know that the promises of
[1:35:52] the word must always apply to a Believer
[1:35:55] who has taken his turn
[1:36:05] I'm going to show you example today so I
[1:36:08] wanted to follow me here
[1:36:12] would be very hard to live a Christian
[1:36:14] Life
[1:36:18] foreign
[1:37:25] foreign
[1:38:06] [Music]
[1:38:09] but a married woman
[1:38:12] she has no need to fear reproach
[1:38:16] because to why it is not reproached
[1:38:19] because
[1:38:23] the Bible says when they reproach you
[1:38:25] for the sake of Christ
[1:38:29] blessed are you
[1:38:31] hallelujah amen when you become pregnant
[1:38:34] and you are married
[1:38:43] you'll even take pictures
[1:39:01] and everybody will be happy and no one
[1:39:05] will look at you as a bad woman
[1:39:09] everybody will look at you as a blessed
[1:39:11] woman
[1:39:13] and the Bible says the fruit of the womb
[1:39:16] is your reward
[1:39:19] so in the sun somewhere
[1:39:22] why the people fear the reproach of
[1:39:25] Christ through our children
[1:39:27] because they don't understand
[1:39:31] Christ is to them but only if you can
[1:39:34] understand
[1:39:36] Christ is your life
[1:39:39] is
[1:39:44] the word of God is everything you need
[1:39:48] everything you need is in the word of
[1:39:51] God
[1:39:52] if you can understand that
[1:39:55] you want fear to be reproached
[1:39:58] because you believe the world
[1:40:04] will you stand for what the word says
[1:40:09] fight to your other friends about Christ
[1:40:14] and when they don't accept him
[1:40:16] you won't feel ashamed
[1:40:19] hallelujah amen because you know thank
[1:40:22] God man you are ready to take the
[1:40:23] reproach of Christ universe
[1:40:34] listen
[1:40:35] you always have to stand this reproach
[1:40:39] in order to give your testing
[1:40:45] every man that comes to Christ
[1:40:54] for the purpose that God has ordained
[1:40:58] you foreign
[1:41:07] there is a purpose God has ordained for
[1:41:09] you
[1:41:10] again
[1:41:12] praise the name of the Lord
[1:41:18] you know the husband just brought me to
[1:41:20] you right now do you think there is a
[1:41:22] purpose of God has ordained you foreign
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:42] sincerely if that is what life is to you
[1:41:44] you've lost it
[1:41:49] you don't have purpose
[1:41:56] every child of God
[1:42:02] has a purpose
[1:42:08] and remember if you can just keep quiet
[1:42:12] remember if he has called you for this
[1:42:15] foreign
[1:43:00] you know I was I was 13 about exactly 15
[1:43:04] when I found out
[1:43:07] when I found my life's purpose
[1:43:11] and when I found my life's purpose
[1:43:15] nothing mattered challenge whatever I
[1:43:18] decided to do
[1:43:20] was going to help me achieve my life's
[1:43:22] purpose
[1:43:26] we need to make in our life
[1:43:30] connections we need to cut off from
[1:43:32] ourselves
[1:43:42] because we have found our lives
[1:43:49] [Music]
[1:43:50] purpose
[1:43:53] needed to force him to leave his people
[1:43:55] because
[1:44:00] had found his life's purpose
[1:44:03] and when it dawned on him that he had to
[1:44:06] let Lord go and that was
[1:44:12] because he realized Lord was hindering
[1:44:15] him
[1:44:17] from achieving his life's purpose
[1:44:21] you see if you don't know your life
[1:44:25] you are as a cow without a driver
[1:44:30] you are you don't know where you are
[1:44:32] going
[1:44:33] you are playing that is like an
[1:44:37] autopilot
[1:44:38] and you don't know where you are going
[1:44:41] anytime you might you know might hit
[1:44:43] something
[1:44:44] anytime you might you know have an
[1:44:46] accident
[1:44:48] let me tell you
[1:44:50] especially the younger generation
[1:44:53] the younger people you know you need to
[1:44:57] realize your life's purpose
[1:45:56] because you know you're being reproached
[1:46:00] because of Christ or a crystal Christ
[1:46:02] will give you your life's purpose
[1:46:06] this word is meant to give us our lives
[1:46:12] hallelujah amen
[1:46:15] listen then He says
[1:46:18] every man that comes to Christopher
[1:46:23] is ordained for a purpose remember
[1:46:29] if he has called you for this
[1:46:32] there is nothing that can keep it from
[1:46:34] happening
[1:46:37] Hallelujah I mean there are things that
[1:46:40] God has purpose for us to achieve in
[1:46:41] this life
[1:46:45] but also there is a main purpose
[1:46:50] all of us
[1:46:54] the real purpose of this message
[1:47:05] that is my life's purpose
[1:47:11] that is it
[1:47:12] is
[1:47:21] people especially in politics and other
[1:47:23] rooms of Life
[1:47:27] they will do anything for their greater
[1:47:29] purpose
[1:47:32] and that's all right
[1:47:35] we as Believers
[1:47:37] we also have a greater purpose
[1:47:45] are you ready to do anything for that
[1:47:47] purpose
[1:47:59] [Music]
[1:48:03] but I'm talking about cutting them out
[1:48:05] of your life
[1:48:08] if if it will call you
[1:48:11] to to do some rational decisions
[1:48:20] if it will make you to be misunderstood
[1:48:24] [Music]
[1:48:27] because you must your purpose is only on
[1:48:30] one thing
[1:48:31] the coming of the Lord
[1:48:35] nothing is going to hinder
[1:48:38] there's one sister's brother who sang a
[1:48:40] song he says there I want nothing
[1:48:51] [Music]
[1:48:58] it makes no difference
[1:49:14] [Music]
[1:49:49] whether it means that you are going to
[1:49:51] be the poorest of the poor or that's it
[1:49:53] again
[1:49:56] and it will take that for you to go
[1:50:02] wherever it means you have to be the
[1:50:04] richest of the richest
[1:50:13] from everything else
[1:50:20] let us have that purpose
[1:50:24] of lives
[1:50:27] here I'm going to make it I'm going to
[1:50:31] go to the road

[1:53:35] learns to believe it

[1:53:42] my life
[1:53:44] you must say that it happens in your
[1:53:46] life

[1:53:57] to live above the pride of life

[1:58:36] were a generation of overcomes
[1:58:38] [Music]
[1:58:41] open with meaning in your Bible to the

[1:59:04] read from verses 17.
[1:59:12] this is where
[1:59:19] Moses
[1:59:21] Musa according to the instruction of God
[1:59:26] he sent out spies
[1:59:31] amen amen
[1:59:34] and let us read together
[1:59:40] let us read verse by verse I mean and
[1:59:43] Moses sent them to spy out the land of
[1:59:45] Canaan and say done to them get you up
[1:59:48] this way Southward and go up into the
[1:59:51] mountains
[2:00:04] and see the land what it is and the
[2:00:07] people that dwelleth therein whether
[2:00:10] they be strong or weak few or many
[2:00:12] foreign
[2:00:33] [Music]
[2:00:46] whether there be water in or not and be
[2:00:49] of good courage and bring of the fruit
[2:00:52] of the land now the time was the time of
[2:00:55] the first
[2:00:56] striped grips
[2:01:13] so they went up and searched the land
[2:01:16] from the Wilderness of sin until men
[2:01:19] come to hamath and they ascended by the
[2:01:21] south and came unto Hebron where are
[2:01:24] human and they tell Maya they should not
[2:01:27] wear now Hebron was built seven years
[2:01:30] before Zone in Egypt
[2:02:14] a branch with one cluster of grapes and
[2:02:17] they bear it between two two upon a
[2:02:20] staff and they brought of the
[2:02:21] pomegranates and of the figs
[2:02:33] [Music]
[2:02:43] the place was called The Brook of escort
[2:02:46] because of the cluster of grapes which
[2:02:49] the children of Israel cut from down
[2:02:51] from themselves
[2:03:00] for a Time
[2:03:03] Moses their prophet had given them the
[2:03:06] message
[2:03:10] and the message was
[2:03:13] God has sent me
[2:03:16] to take you to a land I'm going with
[2:03:19] milk and honey
[2:03:24] you will love it all you young men and
[2:03:27] young ladies and all the ones
[2:03:32] thanking all of you my name is
[2:03:59] you know how it was there and you know
[2:04:03] God stood with them
[2:04:05] because they were with the prophet and
[2:04:08] they reached a place called
[2:04:10] um
[2:04:11] this uh the the one that I just Kadesh
[2:04:14] never to come fetch it was
[2:04:20] and at this time
[2:04:23] God told Moses
[2:04:25] tell these people
[2:04:29] to choose among themselves
[2:04:30] [Music]
[2:04:37] America
[2:04:42] 12.
[2:04:44] let them send
[2:04:47] these people to Canada
[2:04:50] and let them spy out the land bucket
[2:04:53] take in Sea and so they went to Canaan
[2:04:55] never again and spied out the land the
[2:04:57] market and see and as they were going
[2:05:01] we found that now they reached and they
[2:05:04] they were able to get some because Moses
[2:05:06] had told them be of Guru College get
[2:05:08] something from some something from there
[2:05:10] a fruit or something
[2:05:15] go and come back and tell us
[2:05:18] because I know what God told me is true
[2:05:23] the land is good and synonyms
[2:05:29] and so when they went back in that verse
[2:05:32] 25 says and they returned from searching
[2:05:35] of the land after 40 days
[2:05:42] and they went and came to Moses and to
[2:05:46] iron and to all the congregation of the
[2:05:48] children of Israel and to the Wilderness
[2:05:49] apparent to parent unto kaddish and
[2:05:51] brought back word unto them and unto all
[2:05:54] the congregation and showed them the
[2:05:56] fruit of the land
[2:06:20] is always true
[2:06:24] always true
[2:06:27] but usually what God does
[2:06:30] he stands here at the beginning of your
[2:06:32] life
[2:06:38] here is where I'm taking you
[2:06:41] it's perfect
[2:06:47] that's what God does he doesn't tell you
[2:06:51] the process
[2:06:55] and many of us are excited
[2:06:59] become a Christian even they got a song
[2:07:07] I
[2:07:09] don't sing that song because
[2:07:14] you you don't just flow you are not just
[2:07:17] flowing to heaven then I'm good you are
[2:07:21] going through battles
[2:07:22] it's not easy
[2:07:26] since the Christian life is not easy
[2:07:30] you have to take a stand
[2:07:35] and here you promised them
[2:07:37] that you are going over to a land
[2:07:41] sit flowing with milk and honey
[2:07:47] please be of courage take some fruits
[2:07:51] and bring them to us
[2:07:54] I don't know how they went there
[2:07:56] because they were spies
[2:08:07] they have to make themselves look like
[2:08:10] spies
[2:08:13] they had to go
[2:08:16] in a very subtle way
[2:08:19] they will not be understood their
[2:08:21] mission
[2:08:23] but when they arrived they found the
[2:08:26] fruits
[2:08:28] everything God had said it was true
[2:08:32] but there was something
[2:09:36] foreign
