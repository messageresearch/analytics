42 I request someone with the English Bible you read for us today I have a look Bible brother shalom read amen says yeah they turned back and and tempt tempted God and limited the Holy One of Israel

come Lord and have your own way take the preeminence in Christ Jesus we pray amen you may have your seats amen uh where we have read brother you can read in luganda amen amen uh in verses 41 of the English Bible there is somewhere he mentioned that uh [Music] they limited God blessed be the name of the Lord amen you know when God C of Israelite when he called them and he told them he was taking the promised land remember that was after they cry in the wilderness H sorry in the sea of bondage blessed be the name of the Lord and the Lord heard their prayers and here Moses God sent Moses and after Moses met God in the wilderness and God gave him that commission amen remember we are in Third Exodus that was the first Exodus blessed be the name of the Lord amen they cried to God because God had given them the promise and after that time they supposed to go back to the Homeland blessed be the name of the Lord and here God sent them the prophet Moses met God and God gave him uh signs and wonders and told him Aaron will be a prophet and Moses Moses was God blessed be the name of the Lord and here in Psalms the Bible tells us we are seeing here that uh they limited God blessed be the name of the Lord and even in this thir Exodus let us be careful L we limit God also because the Bible tells us that whatever happened to them in the wilderness it was for our examples praise be to God Amen and remember he shall repeat himself blessed be the name of the Lord whatever happened the children of Israel if we say that we are in Third Exodus the same same thing will happen alongside the way but depends where you are putting your focus as long as you're looking at God you just know that we are defeating the enemy blessed be the name of the Lord that's why the Bible tells us that we should lay aside every weight and every sin that was easily set us that we run this race with patience amen you must run this race with patience we are in the race blessed be the name of the Lord we are not in picnic we are fighting the Lord's battle and Jesus himself is the ship captain and as long as Jesus is commanding the battle there's no way we can be defeated blessed be the name of the Lord and what we supposed to do is H to look at God he saying in Matthew 11 ver 28 come unto me all those who are y with heavy lad and I will give you rest take my my yoke for my yoke is light blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus is giving us a yoke light a y which is light praise be to God you canot run this race when you are caring a lot of WM in you you cannot run this race with mming you cannot run when you are complaining blessed be the name of the Lord we are running the rest it is the Lord's rest amen it's the rest to survive blessed be the name of the Lord we are fighting the battle it is the Lord's battle we are fighting a finished battle praise be to God I told you the other time each time I come I come charge to face the devil to undress the enemy blessed be the name of the Lord and tonight praise be to God amen amen I will talk about discouragement blessed be the name of the Lord I want us to attack that Spirit of discouragement we are living in the time where there's a lot of pressure praise be to God but our God is unlimited it is up to you to limit but our God is infinite is unlimited it's powerful it's wonderful praise be to God our God is a powerful God is a winning God praise be to God amen amen before he go for I want to take a quote here message leadership he said that and sometime sometimes Satan might come along and cause them to be discouraged but remember you went through the same thing discouragement forsaken by men of earth and people and sometime very dear of friends even relationships we are forsaken but there is one that we have chosen he will never leave us or forsake us blessed be the name of the Lord there is one and that one is Jesus amen Great Men come and go we have heard of Great Men who could speak on the world quick when he say that tomorrow you will not see the [Applause] sun used to happen blessed be the name of the Lord Great Men speaking with authority maybe like pop of Rome yes he's a great man even the president of Russia will bow down for that man don't you see that a communist state communist but when the pop speaks that man bows down but as you are speaking now just the other day I was reading uh uh I think I was reading the paper and say that pop is very sick the Vicor of Christ is very sick blessed be the name of the Lord we have unlimited God and that God has unlimited Sons amen praise be to God we are as good as our God are you sure brother me yes I am talking to you whoever is looking at me I you blessed be the name of the Lord when God was moving in this world Amen when God sent his servant he saw that you are the right person to be called you are the right person to be chosen that's why you are here tonight when he came to your home there he by pass your sh LC he your MPS he all those ministers blessed be the name of the Lord and went and big sister praise there amen praise be to God and he went to big sister here praise be to God hallelujah am praise the Lord amen amen I giv the media Department fail to give a blessed be the name of the Lord com amen so when these people unlimited God majority were destroyed in the wildness brother sister our God is unlimited our God is able no matter what is happening around us amen our God is not taken by surprise because the Bible says that we are in the palms of our God we are the apples of God's eye blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah he cares about us just like a man cares about his family if you spend just a whole day when you're not at home without speaking to them you feel there is a lot of burden in your heart praise be to God that's how it is with our God Amen he is a God who loves fellowship and when you come like you have come God is Happy amen he's happy angels are happen because the bride is gathering here because the bride has gathered blessed be the name of the Lord amen we are the children of the most high God before you came in this service Angels were here busying around because amen because the Commander in Shi was coming in this service when the command ship is coming he will send the intelligence group they will come and do inspection and I want to tell you tonight tonight the Angels came here before you came they inspected each and every corner they drive out every demon they kicked out every sickness amen don't limit God he has come and he is here there is no

Thunder Hallelujah that God in the beginning the Bible says the Earth was mixed up was messed up in the beginning blessed be the name of the Lord and the Bible tells us the spirit of God moved on the surface of the water Hallelujah and God spoke and he said let there be do you know how God speaks thed Hallelujah when the Same Spirit comes in you when the same holy goost comes and become incarnate in you we become the sons of of the Thunders we become Thunders to the devil blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah amen amen hard times will come sickness will attack discouragement will attack

the same yest is the same today and forever praise be to God the same same Jesus who died and rose again is living in the church tonight he living in the bride tonight and is speaking to you tonight blessed be the name of the Lord let us not limit him like they did in the wilderness the Bible say mured against God and against Moses and because of that muring very many were destroyed even in this Third Exodus blessed be the name of the Lord we just have to know what we are we are not ordinary people no we are not ordinary we are super humans yes sir we are not ordinary people no sir we are the children of God the people who kneels down and God listen to them the people who can convince God yes sir the Bible tells us that when the Three Angels Fe Abraham and the two went to Sodom Abraham started pleading with God just imagine he was conving God after God was happy with him he said how will I hide anything from my friend Abraham said do you know what my friend have you seen those guys have to Sodom they've gone to destroy Sodom they've gone to spy that is we've had an intelligence God always have an intelligence amen God has his mad blessed be the name of the Lord they always come to spy in every Fellowship they are there the devil also always have his intelligence that's why in job God asked him yes young man hey where are you from you know from just walking to and through just there was is just here moving here and there you know the devil has no has no permanent place sometime he dwells in R sometime it dwells in uh uh it dwells in cancer oh what a bity we should be very careful never to be cast by God because when God cast The Devil the devil became so useless so useless praise be to God that's why the Bible tells us in Isaiah that when we see him we say is this the guy made the nation to tremble [Applause] [Music] maybe a man with someity on the body someone who has been suffering of hunger has been starving that is the devil blessed be the name of the Lord amen so the word of God cares that power that's why when say that whatever you bind on us sometime you wonder Christian come for our night prayer like this and they start doing are you binding or you the one being bored you are given authority to squeeze the devil properly Amen to B him you're free to use any technique you want praise be to God the other side you ra the leg or maybe you put on you P from this side Authority blessed be the name of the Lord look at the traffic officer can stop you anywhere in the middle of the road the side of the road even from very far amen and you cannot Rebel

devil properly SED by next night prayer he will still be in ICU praise be to God squeeze fornication properly squeeze that guy strangle that guy CR him the one who knows but pray with understanding

Praise amen uh thank you brother martin in the message uh El Shai El Shai 1959 brother bam says a few things here I want to read for you it says I'm not here to be seen I'm here because I love you and I'm trying to shake you with the gospel out of that formal Mo mody condition that the people are in he says get back to God all night prayer meeting Revival in your home Revival in your soul get back to believing God acting on his word taking his word and believing it you the Seed of Abraham God has given you the promise God has shown you the sign watch the spirit amen he said get back to all night prayer prayer meeting and and something he says here in the message just once more time Lord it says Pentecost 1963 it says Pentecost a few years ago no more than 50 years ago stood out the people stood different they come out of different groups of world worldliness because of their worldliness and they stood out as an example and God has taken uh that church and today it's one of the most powerful churches in the world but the thing that she is doing she's turned right straight back around and went back into the same conglomeration that she was called out of and when she begins to do that her power is taken from her where do we get that all night pray pray meeting let a preacher preach till about 1 or 2:00 in the morning like he used to do what time is it now it's almost 1:00 in the morning he says he says Where do we get all that where do we get the all night prayer meeting let the preacher preach till about 1 or 2:00 in the morning like he used to do he would be preaching to empty seats they go they got to go home and see we love Susie or somebody on certain television cast you know this used to be a program at that time in the 60s or or 50s on who who loves Susie it used to be like a maybe a so per or something like that like I don't know what they have today I don't watch those things so I don't know if I hope there is no one Among Us who follows those so do they call soas they call it Sops and you know those things they put on on television you follow follow follow follow you know and it is endless it seems to be endless they can watch it throughout the year and another year and you find that someone can't wait they can even go almost being knocked by the car they want to go and watch that program you see Believers are really delivered from those things can you say Amen we are so glad that we are delivered from those things and if you still have have it in your house kick it out it has no place in a believer's home you see but he said that he would be preaching you know to empty seats if a preacher preached up to 1:00 in the morning you would be preaching to empty seats I'm so glad we still have a church where we can see up to 1:00 in the morning amen and the church is not empty Hallelujah he says you see be preaching to empty C people would get out and they go home be watching that those programs of who loves Susie or someone on the television cast now that's the truth why where is your treasure where your treasure is that's where your heart is also so our Treasures ought to be in the word amen praise God and we are so glad today that our Treasures are in the word and I noticed that you know brother bam spoke um you know you would call called it all night prayer meeting and many times he said all night prayer meeting and um um you know of course these were Services of the word the word was being preached and people you know would um have an atmosphere where they would speak to the Lord I believe we are privileged to still have such an opportunity to be able to do that there are many many churches that no longer have that opportunity not only in the Pentecostals even the Pentecostals of these days are becoming lukewarm cold stetchy um so it's a blessing if uh you they believe of this message because even many in the message they don't have time for these kind of things the field is um you know a little bit difficult and quite frankly many people are busy it's a busy Agee everybody is busy you know imagine you've been working the whole day and now Friday they tell you to go for an all night prayer meeting it it seems a bit unrealistic to the body doesn't it but we are not preparing for this body we are preparing for the other body and so when we have an opportunity like this to come and pray to come and be in prayer and and you know hear the word sit and hear the word up to 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning it's a blessing that we can still have that opportunity and then we have many needs in the body if we have an opportunity to come and present them before the Lord and you know have some time of prayer like I said we are busy you become busy at your place of work you become busy at home some of you students you become busy until you even seldom have time to sit down relax and pray but when we have this moment of course I believe that real prayer is in your prayer closet not in a church like this but uh when we are gathered like this we can also have some little opportunity to worship together pray for the collective needs even of the Saints and U it's a blessing you know um and it's okay if you you push your body it's okay amen your body is not going to like it but not everybody not everything your body likes is good so if your body doesn't like it it's okay to push it and let your soul benefit out of it and I'm sure that by the time we leave all of you will be refreshed tired in the body but refreshed in the spirit shall we stand on our on our feet we have a few needs that we want to remember as a church before the Lord in prayer and um I'll be calling shortly brother amram again to lead us in a few songs of worship man and um to lead us in prayer but we we need to remember our brother Emmanuel brother Emmanuel uh and and his wife have been coming to this church for a while now a short while um we I think the other week a week last week but one my myself and a few brothers and and I think one sister we went and had some good time at his house he welcomed us at his house and um that's when where he informed me that he was feeling LED of the Holy Spirit to come and join the ministry here and um uh so this yesterday the he he he was I think on a border border in an and and he they experienced an accident so we want to thank God that uh they has not been as I know of any major damage uh but um we went and saw him in the hospital today he has some kind of wound head injury and maybe on his shoulder on um his left shoulder and and the the left side of the head and maybe a little bit on the foot but uh he's generally okay uh the doctor say that it is a minor not a major one a minor head injury so they did not even need to do a CI can uh so we we want to thank God for that and um it's uh so he's still in the hospital he he supposed to be watched for maybe 48 hours so maybe they may might dismiss them tomorrow today today evening uh that is Saturday evening so we remember we should remember him in prayers his wife was uh very worried but I told her to relax the Lord is in control and uh some brothers came and you know they were really helping out we want to thank God for that also uh we remember Sister Esther Brother Martin mentioned on that sister Esther uh has had ulcers and you know she she was in pain a lot of pain but um she she was taken to moo and I think she came out of the hospital today uh but we still need to remember her that she the Lord will give her uh full recovery so these are the needs we have and of course many other needs as you know um uh in the church here we pray for the ministry we pray there are many things that we as a church have need of I believe when we are gathered like this it's good for us to pray for the collective needs of the church your personal needs and private needs you can always pray at home in your prayer closet we use this two hours three hours that we have to pray for those needs praise the Lord so I think we'll sing a song and then after that song I will invite the brother to come and continue leading us uh there's a song I had here I don't know whether I should have it
