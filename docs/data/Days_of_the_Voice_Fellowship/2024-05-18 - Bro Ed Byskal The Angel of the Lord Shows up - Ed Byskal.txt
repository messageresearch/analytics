========================================

Hallelujah and that was the first time and now I tell you my dear precious friends that is where my understanding of him was anchored there I gained such a Holiness and now you're being so nice I will I will relate a few wish one that I very seldom tell young man are you listening we were riding in the car and he was driving and I was sitting on the passenger side and he had that little white C Boy hat on kind of put it back he said brother Eddie what do you think of this ministry do you think it could be that of Elijah the prophet as it's foretold in the scripture and on down and then he went to Revelation and then his voice just trailed off and I had listened to tapes some of the old real tapes and I heard that when he was under uh a real heavy anointing very heavy in visions and I I would hear him say uh-huh uh-huh uh you come from a certain place you come from the East uhhuh uh-huh and your daughter wrote you a letter uh and the letters in your purse his voice would just Trail off and that's I had observed that you've seen and heard that now I hear his voice just Trail off do you believe this could be that of Elijah the prophet as is foretold in the scripture and then his voice began to Trail off and then the last word I heard was Revelation I felt completely completely incapable I felt that I was not to answer this kind of a question you brothers are listening very intently and I trust this will mean something to you and I I looked down at the glove box and I said well brother brandham for all I know it must be because it has every appearance of being and I kind of looked at him sideways and he put his head back we bit like this said often kind of wondered I kind of think so myself and at that instant at that instant just you talk about a wind you talk about a force nothing you could feel there was nothing you could feel there was nothing physical you could feel but there was a person there was a being that sat between he and I and he was just forward a wee bit just towards the dash I could actually tell you exactly how it was and I thought I thought if I breathe in or exhale I'm going into some other place I'm going to die I'm going into another another world if I breathe and I didn't want to move I was frozen I'm talking to you about him I'm talking to you about the Holiness of this one we call a pillar of Fire and I looked I just looked I cast my eyes sideways because I was afraid to move my head I cast my eyes sideways and looked at him and brother Brandon's beard we had about four days of beard and I know that when a person is under extreme trauma their beard will stick out prickly and his beard was prickly sticking out on his face and I saw his color had drained from his face and I thought he looks like he's near death brother Brandon rolled his head back slowly slowly just over to the side the eyes were the same as they were when I was on the log he looked at me he said brother Eddie and I was just thinking he looks like he's near death he said brother Eddie I guess he's come to me 10,000 times 10,000 and that's just every time like I could die and just at that moment I had been hunting for Moose for meat large animal I stand about 2 meters at the shoulders and brother Brandon was driving and he was just we're going around on the gravel Highway going around this curve and there's this large animal standing in the middle of the road and it shocked me I said oh oh brother brandom there's a moose I said you know it just stop I'll get him and his voice is still slow and thick and he says it's it's it's all right brother Eddie it's all right just get your gun and your shells I had my gun in my hand he said just get your gun and your shells it's all right and he just kept driving the same speed I said stop brother Brom I'll get him now we're just maybe a 100 m or less and he said it's all right he said something like it's yours he's yours he said just have your gun and he drove up the closest I've ever been to a wild animal about 90 M and stops and I get out and I have a scope on my rifle and I'm looking through the scope and all I see is hair I can't even see the animal and I have to lift the gun up to the sky and see the hump and the animal and bring it down it's the only time in my life I had that experience and I pulled the trigger and I saw the bullet actually now some of you people may not like this but this we live on meat and and the bullet just entered in and poof and then I thought oh I don't want him to stop I don't want him to stop on the highway someone will come over the hill and hit him and we'll have an accident I I thought and then there a wide area maybe like from here to the wall That's all clear just grass and then trees starting there and I thought I don't want him to fall there some we don't have room and somebody will come and steal him and take all this meat maybe five six 700 lbs of meat a large animal and and I needed that animal for food food for my family and and and the Moose he just walked down stepped off the highway and he started to walk slowly slowly and I know he's not going to go very far and I don't want him I need him hid because I don't need him out in this grass somebody will steal him and he walks into the trees and just as he walks into the trees I fire another shot another young brother was traveling with us catching a ride he fired a shot and a moose stepped over two big logs two big logs and was completely hidden and fell right there you say would God do that absolutely my father would do that and completely hid that animal and we dressed we dressed the animal and God's Prophet sat on a tree right beside us and he watched me and the other young man and we dressed this animal got it all ready got it dressed we finished wiped our knives walked back to the car brother Brown walked with me we got in a car he sat in his seat and I sat friends I'm not given over to special things but I was surrounded in an atmosphere it was it was so Divine it even had a color it was like emerald green there was nothing my eyes were registering I said this is the most beautiful place I thought oh God I'd like to just live here forever and the prophet laid his head back looked at me he said brother Eddie every time he comes something good happens brother colen brother you called this meeting and you precious people

deep but I want to tell you I'm a living witness there's one that knows the one that's got that in his hand and that was the prophet's Ministry is to put us in contact with him and I'm telling you
