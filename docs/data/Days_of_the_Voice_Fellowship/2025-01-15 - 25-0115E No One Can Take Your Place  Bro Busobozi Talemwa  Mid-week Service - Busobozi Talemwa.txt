chapter 27 10 ver 27 my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand amen My Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's [Music] hand amen amen you may be seated may God bless you brother Dixon I just think I have a lot of sound but I just need the quality but not because it is doing a Reverb uh God bless each of you God bless you amen how many enjoy the Youth Camp amen I uh I hope there is no one who missed the Youth Camp from this church sincerely if they missed I don't know what to say but God gave us a wonderful weekend and uh I know that many of us have rekindled the Fire Within amen am I talking about someone here amen the fire is Rec kindled brother Marvin do you have the pictures a moment I gave you much time so uh I was not um uh this afternoon I have been I was invited by Brother Baka and sister phbe that's why I'm actually dressed like this uh I had gone to eat food Al I didn't much time there to enjoy with them at least I was there briefly and you know most of her family was there she was celebrating her graduation just attained a master's degree amen and so they sent their greetings and that's why they not able to be here tonight if brother M was ready you could give us the pictures I gave him I know the ones online perhaps uh they already have the pictures you know we need to buy a new laptop here that's why usually delays if someone wants to help on that it's just about a million or a little less we need a new laptop someone wants to take that blessing amen I'm sure someone will come up and so that we can have a new laptop there and I also wanted to show you a a few pictures of the brothers they traveled back home safely I've actually heard from Pastor Shan and he he told me he arrived last night so um I also heard from uh Pastor Manda from Zimbabwe we also arrived well so the Lord has been good and he gave us good meetings and he has given us a good time there are many testimonies coming in from Believers uh there is um you know I had it's amazing I had many people giving testimonies or how they spoke in tongues for the first day the first time in these meetings you know this sister sent me this testimony let me read it out to you say may God richly bless you for the vision of the church and for allowing yourself to yield to the Holy Spirit God bless you so I'm texting for for two reasons but I'll read you only one is that on Saturday of the convention I spoke in tongues the whole way down the services every time I could open my mouth to start praying I end up speaking instead and when the service ended all I could do was laugh and laugh and I remember I remained laughing I remained laughing alone in church for some good time when my heart from the inside couldn't stop I just couldn't control and the spirit of the Lord kept telling me that the convention was to let us know that our prayers and petitions have been heard and he is manifesting them [Music] according so that was a different way I have ever had an experience with the Holy Spirit but it felt too joyous and I felt like all my prayers were answered and I F and I felt like I was so sure Beyond doubt that it is done there was love there was love and reassurance I got down in my soul that it is well and well amen amen this is testimony came from Sister Johan and many others as well so like last year we are going to put up a um a link probably tonight so that you can click there and then you put your you write your testimony there those testimonies encourage others praise the Lord okay you can give us the pictures if you have them okay these lights are making people not see properly are you seeing the picture some yes some no okay yes okay so you can see there all my teeth is outside I'm so happy for that's better brother Dixon and you can see sister phibe there and the husband on the right okay they invited me at a very expensive hotel by and he only had a family there so I'm the one who represented the church family give us another picture ah you can see us there we are very happy continue brother I hope you have them in order okay just continue just continue okay do we have another one okay okay I think there's one or two you skipped but uh it's all right that's brother Andrew and Pastor sha at the airport just continue and play them all because we don't have time and uh this is when we were seeing them off I have more pictures but uh because of the speed I might have to call that off yes that's all okay all right so if you want more I think you will stream the service I think the brother has put put up on right God bless you shall We Now go to the little sharing tonight someone still want more of God tonight amen how many appre all the young ministers who ministered on the amen I mean we had brother brother am brother J mention your name stand up uh you know let's clap for them we had brother Brian here brother shalom come on get up and I I see someone hiding there brother Steven stand up Steven [Music] me yes let us give them brother Dix Dix amen these were on the machines and music and anybody else who ministered in a different stand up stand up on your stand up for recognition God bless you look around look around look around God bless you so much we really appreciate all those who labored in different ways to make that success God bless you God has more for us amen amen so I just want I'm not going to speak for so long I'm trying to preserve my energy for and also I've been quite overworked past you know uh months so I really C your prayers and you know I'm just warming up to to travel to L will'll be there from I'm traveling there on on Friday morning and we will be there the whole weekend because the meetings they have Saturday Friday Saturday Sunday and then I travel back on Monday morning so uh just please keep us in prayer so today I just want to share on something small since I'm not preaching to you on Sunday I figed I should speak to you today I'm speaking on a little subject of no one can take your place turn to your neighbor and tell them no one can take your place Jesus said my sheep hear my voice and they know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand and another scripture says I've inscribed you in the palm of my hand it comes to show that every child of God that comes to God he's not misplaced I am not misplaced my sound is not really good this evening tell your neighbor I am not misplaced I cannot be misplaced tell them I will never be misplaced hallelujah amen we are in the palm of God's hand and we can never be misplaced and we can never perish amen he said no one can plock us out you know pling Out means like something is already embedded inside so you can't PL it out and you PL it out so now Jesus is saying his elect they are in the palm of his hands and no one can PL them out I cannot be pled out he has placed me I am there permanently amen you know why I'm sharing on this tonight there many people who when they see God using someone they feel that ah now someone has has replaced me one thing that has helped me in my life and uh in Ministry is I do not compete with anyone I never compete and I tell you this helps you it will help you in your dayto life you do NE never compete with anyone each of us is special each of us has a a a certain role a certain work that God has placed for us and you know when God places you in a a position he puts what we call maybe you can call it a gift and that gift says God's gifts will always find their place if it is a gift of God it will always find its place and you know this will help you not only in Ministry but also in your day-to-day life sometimes it is Siblings at home you know uh excuse me brother Dixon I wonder I think this is just off or something sorry sometimes it's hard to preach when you can't hear yourself you use a lot of strength and that's why we always have to tell this brother to tune uh you know we just came from the camp and some of these things are just getting tuned amen so um sometimes at home how many are here with their siblings raise up your hand oh how many have siblings raise up hand even me I have siblings you see many times when you're growing up at home you know there is jealousy jealousy that comes out if maybe a parent gives someone something you feel it should have been yours and you begin to cry so that you can also get it you know I've seen it among my children many times and you know you may even give them theirs and when you bring something else they begin crying they weren exactly the same and that's why you have seen many people sometimes especially younger children wearing the same color of [Music] clothes same type of of shoes same dress because there is competition somewhere they want to feel that they all equal they want to feel that they are all no one is above the other and the moment they even feel that they above someone is above them then they will not be happy you know so but I want to show you tonight that no one can take your place and you see that sometimes you even find in the work of the ministry when people begin competing you know say well I'm going to H so and so s a special song I I'm going to train I'm going to practice and I will when I begin singing everyone will know I'm the singer here so when I begin hearing oh so I'm sing so well no they don't know they don't know me when they hear about me that's when they know there is a sing competition did you know even preachers compete especially younger preachers they want to show that they better than somebody else singers same song leaders the same thing ministers same thing Believers same thing even sometimes churches compete and we want to make it like football teams you've had people say oh our church is the best chur there is nothing like that in Christ there's only one one who is better and that is Jesus Christ and when he is in your heart you will never compete with anyone there is a secret in finding your place in Christ there is a a very important uh what I would call an opportunity when you understand your calling and you understand last time I preach on your purpose in life and you understand why you are born you receive the revelation of your purpose the moment you receive that in life you do not care who does what you do not care who said what about you you don't mind what comes and what goes you focus on your calling amen it's just like a housewife who is not satisfied nothing can ever satisfy her if she feels you know there are women like that especially in the world even sometimes in the church you know when she she's always insecure thinking whenever the man goes out he's going to get another one when he's talking to a woman now now he's going to oh he has sent a message let me see let me see what's happening what did he say you know she's insecure she always feels someone will take her place you know that insecurity comes from a lack of understanding of who you are but the moment you receive a revelation that look I am married to this man he had all his chances he left all the others for me for me he came to my Village for me he paid my bright for me he publicly announced that he loves me for me you know he made my Village check for me he has we have a marriage certificate we had a wedding for me so therefore I don't care who these people are that even dress and walk around so that he can see them I know my place I am not a girl friend I am his wife praise the name of the Lord I am his wife and you know women like my wife knows her place sometimes I travel countries go away for weeks and weeks and you know should not ask me who did you talk to today I'm going to come to check your phone when you I mean my wife has has my password I have a password we can always see what each other is talking if we want we can do it for fun but not for checking is someone taking my place when you get that attitude lose focus on whatever you are doing so when I'm abroad she's just so you know comfortable in our home knowing I am hers and she is mine in the same way Jesus Christ wants us to understand whatever he designed us to be and whatever we are in his economy no man can take your place but the question is do you know your place and he said and they shall never perish I'll give them eternal life neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man can everyone say no man is able to PL them out of my father's hand and in Hebrews chapter 2 brother says think of it brother my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they won't follow oh how that our names are on the palm of his hands it is before him day and night his word is always before him his promise he cannot forget and he loves you now he will bear witness of his own you don't open your mouth and say a word the world will know something has happened to you praise the name of the Lord he knows his sheep I am the Sheep of his pastor uh can you open 1 Corinthians 12: 20 1 Corinthians 12: says but now are they many members yet one body and the eye cannot say unto the hand I have no need of [Music] thee nor again the hand to the feet I have no need of you vers2 much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncomely parts have more abundant cess for our parts have no need but God has tempered the body together having given more abant honor to that part which lacked that there should be no shm in the body but that members should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members Rejoice with [Music] it praise the name of the Lord in another part of the scripture the Bible speaks of vessels there are different vessels praise the name of the Lord I didn't plan to read that but let me find it out here uh first second Timothy Chapter 2 we read from vers 19 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of the Christ depart from [Music] iniquity but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of Earth and some to honor and some to dishonor if a man that Pur himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified and meat for the Master's use and prepared unto every good work flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness Faith charity peace with them that call on the name of the Lord of a pure heart the master wants to use all of us but for you to be a vessel of Honor you must have purified yourself you must have prepared yourself you remember brother bham was one of the actually is the vessel of hor in our generation from when he was a child you know when he was I think seven years old you know in that when he was going to bring water to go and give to his father to prepare moonshine you see you know the voice spoke to him out of a tree and you know he's born in a family of drunkards the father is a drunkard he makes alcohol and and he's going to fetch water so that he can you know serve his father the water and then they make the mo but God had a plan for him just like I believe God has a plan for many of you tonight just like God had a plan for me and a voice came out of that tree out of the wildwind and spoke to him and he said called his name so he was startled so you know when God calls you there is a purpose there is a purpose and a voice said let me tell you before I continue There are many who have heard this message but they simply walk away but you came you answered the call Now find the purpose of God for your life find the purpose of God what does God want you to do in the body what work does he want you to do in the body which Duty find it you cannot be in the body and you are not a useful part you know what he does to useless Parts you remember how what he did to that tree he cast it why because it did not produce FR but now remember this it was not the time for that tree to produce fruit it was the season of the tree to bear fruit was it it was not but he required fruit so in other words it was his season not the Tre season when God brings you the word it is God's season for that word which has been preached to you to be made manifest so you must always respond you must always design that this is God speaking to me and you accept that word for that moment because if you miss it you will miss your purpose in life and you see by the B you know the angel came out of the spoke to and called name and said never drink Never Smoke defile your body in way there is a work for you to do when you get older seven years seven years how old are you seven years he was God calls you and God calls you some of you have been turning down for years maybe in this little service you will accept that call seven years he work you know he had many times we preach and say oh it's not what we do it's what he does because he had to be a ver of hor he had to make a sacrifice and turn down things other young people were not turning down he to turn down girlfriends you had to turn down you had to turn down cigarettes you had to turn down everything because of the calling which was upon his life these are things when they enter into your life they frustrate the call of God and the purpose of God for your life amen and you know but when you answer the call like like Abraham answer the he stayed away from everything including his family things God called him to walk away and um brother bam when God called him he walked away and and and submitted his entire life to that calling of God and later on when he grew he realized God was using him in a special way he realized you know there were things he was understanding that you know the other denomination of people were are not understanding even his Pastor I don't remember his name someone if you remember his name tell he was in the Baptist Church and you know this pastor told him because he was a minister in the church he told him now you're going to ordain a woman preacher so you see he went to read the Bible but whatever you could find there was not allowing him to do it he read in second in first Timothy which says I forbid a woman to accept authority over a man to teach to accept authority over a man and when he read that it's like but now also he says here that a bishop must be hband of one wife ruling his own house well how then can I ordain a woman preacher he stayed with the word and you know the church could not stay with him when you stay with the word you will lose friendship sometimes when you answer the call there will always be a Separation by the way let me tell you that every man in the Bible who has answered the call had a separation somewhere tell me anyone that answered any call and never had a separation Abraham separated with his people John separated with his parents do you know John's father and mother were PRS but when he was called and he answered the call he had leave he left the temple he left the home and he went to the bush he began eating honey and and and honey and why because he answered the call talk about William brared with his family with his church you know you can give me another example talk about David David his entire life was all about separation he separated with the you know his family the moment he was anointed that anointing took him in the palace even when he reached the palace sa wanted to kill him that same anointing had to separate him again and took him somewhere until he became a king if God calls you and you accept that calling into the your God called position there must be a separation sometimes God is calling you to be a wife of someone you cannot be a wife of someone and remain with all the who and things he used to do the friends and you know there must be a separation but the problem is many people don't want to separate they want to separate so we see here I'm talking about your your place by the way there is nothing more beautiful in this life that knowing your place one of the man the men that mentored me Bishop the WR Dr Bishop you know they have many titles in the Anglican Church I loved it the way he spoke he called a SP a SP when you ask him his opinion about politics whether or not he can join politics you know he would answer you quickly oh no for us we are called into Ministry and minister is life of service like oh I love that but sometimes you find ministers who are to and fr he's standing for political position here is preaching is doing this he wants to be a businessman brother when God calls you to do something he will make a way for you to do it and accomplish it just stay in your God position many times when God calls a man he doesn't tell him how he will be able to accomplish the [Music] work but he simply calls you and he says go but he has not told you where you he told Elijah Elijah go you will find a brook and he will eat from there so he was Wonder I mean if if a man was supposed to ask questions would have had a million questions who will cook for me there will there be food from what will happen water alone will I drink that what if it dries but you see when you know God has called you and you have accepted the call you become crazy even when you have no answers you just say Amen Lord I will do just what you have told me to do and a man walked and he went to that Brook he walked and walked and walk God never gave him Direction God never told him the town where the BR is but he walked just keep walking with the word you will find your place of your calling and when he arrived there he found the water ah he rejoiced he was very thirsty he began drinking and then he just sat there God told me to stay here but I don't know what I will eat but I believe him and little by little Revelation began coming you know revelation manest himself I'm sure he must have believed come to a place where I was like but God is able to provide food from nowhere and maybe as soon as he said that a raven came and came with food R of all birs where did the food come from where did the food come from have you ever thought about I believe it must have been like where the mana come from it must have come from Heaven that was more than a ren that was an angel of the Lord but he hum himself amen you know God hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself in the same don't look for big things when you're looking for God look for simple things when you are looking for God that is how God moves that's how God speaks and that R came the angel of the Lord came he didn't come with a sword and Pur but he came just for a specific reason in a way he least expected but you know that is a flying bird praise the name of the Lord God will provide for you in a way you least expected just keep believing him and you know he drunk and drunk and drunk and Rens kept on coming but the same God who provides in a way he will provide in another God is Not limed tell your neighbor God is not limited when one door closes another door will always open because our God is all the all sufficient one Our God Amen cannot be quenched is unquenchable the flow will flow until his purpose has been accomplished in my life in your life you know he always teaches us to have faith and it came to a moment where the brook dried but Elijah kept trusting and another time when everything was dry now he told him now now my servant I love trusting God he's so sweet trust in Jesus and to depend upon his don't depend on man 2025 don't depend on man let us depend on Jesus it is so sweet to depend on him don't depend on your husband don't depend on your father don't depend on your uncle don't depend on your brother your sister your wife your father your mother come on let us depend on on God that same God will use anything he will use anyone however way he wants to use them and he tells him now my servant I have a woman I have commanded to take care of you did you know God can command someone to take care of you your needs you just see someone willing to do something for you don't refuse receive it with joy and don't worship them worship the god you prayed toen hallelujah amen and you know I've commanded a widow woman to take care of you I've commanded her how did you command her not with a voice because when Elijah arrived at this place this WD woman never knew anything God is not a liar amen like Pastor Manda said God is not a man God is God and when he speaks his word has to happen and so he said I've commanded her to take care of you but when he arrived there she did not even know him she didn't even know about the Commandment receive let me tell you this here some of you are finished school and are looking for jobs and some of you have not even done school but you want jobs God has commanded someone to give you a God is the is the same yester amen and that person who is commanded does not even know it but God will make them understand and here when this woman arrived with this man arrived there he was speaking with authority you know when you you are just asking for help you you beg but he was not begging don't be a beggar 2025 because God has commanded someone to help amen he came and spoke with authority he said give me a glass of water as she was going also bring me some food said but I don't have food I only have for me and myself just do what I say bring me food and water and you know she did not know she was under commandment she had to obey because she was under commandment and you know when she went something spoke to her why don't you just do it that was God speaking rather you move by faith not by sight help will come when God wants it to come your answer will arrive as long as you move by faith Elijah answered the call and God led him all the way but Elijah had to separate himself well in the message come let us reasen together our Prophet says we all have different parts God has put the furniture in the house now watch the television say I will just not be a television no more if I can't be the ice box television is out but if we all just find Our Calling in God and abide there abide there if you know me I'm an interpreter that is what I do and touches people there me I am a songer don't try and be a preacher unless you know God has call you to do that me I'm a preacher don't try and try to take that take this even in music you find sometimes people are fighting he wants to be the drama he wants to be The Pianist he wants to be the the he wants to be everything and his fighting for everything and also when you talk to him or her they begin to have attitude you know when you let me tell you how you know that someone is not in the right place that they can't take correction what okay do it for yourself I would never do anything again there is an attitude there is a wrong spirit this person doesn't know their calling you see abide in your calling you know like even a woman who doesn't know her calling married to a man you know they have a little misunderstanding these days it has changed but then okay let me go back to my and they their they don't know they calling right woman does not go back home where she came from sisters have refused to say Amen a right woman does not go even if things are sour you stay there if the man say go back you say where am I going you mared me when you are not seeing me the qu will come later but going home even what are you talking now where should I me alone this is my home hallelujah amen after you will later after a woman came out of the man's rib now if a man chases you go back to your home you just come and hold here where you came from said this is my home women who are going to if you're going to get married man you can sck on yes don't know God knows just when to use us and how to use us we don't want to be jumping here and there be where God put you be original be just what God wants you to be I say Amen don't try to be like somebody else oh you know that person when they sing they make their hair like this and they have something here and then they do like this and the hair goes in the back I want to do the same thing you just don't know who you are you don't know who you are when they sing I've heard the other brother sing when he sing he he dances like that and there is a way he throws his legs and there is a way he dances and people love that I want to do the be yourself you know there is something about plastic plastic surgery is very dangerous it's just like someone who smiles when they are sad on the on the heart you can see it it's a plastic SM so you find even in in this generation you have a lot of women who have become plastic plastic hair plastic eyelids plastic smile of course it is full of blood blood make makeup it's not their lips is plastic plastic the ear is not original there is something dling there what if God Made You with an ear dangling like this would you have loved it but why do they do it they don't want to be original find yourself your dark skin you want to become light people don't appreciate each themselves she wants to go and get something and look like somebody look like a woman who told you a woman look a woman looks like you we all a flower garden of [Music] God is a god of variety and the way he made you is the way he wants you and the way he made you is the way you will fit in the puzzle you are supposed to fit [Music] in if someone doesn't like you the way you are God has somebody who will like you the way you are someone right now as I'm talking they are looking for someone just like you but they have not found you yet but when they find you they will jump up this is exactly what I was looking for when I found my wife you could not convince me other way there is another one I had seen her I had known this is exactly what I was looking for now when you begin to tell me she's not good she's not beautiful she's not this I would just laugh at you this is what I've been looking let me tell you because there is a deep calling there is a deep response the way you are is the way God wants you be original some of you sisters stop making worldly hair andal to the public you see stay away from those be natural be the way God wants you to be be the way God you know my wife you know before we got married ah I've already said it she used to put you know how is that thing called H something to make the the hair darker okay so I told her we were just in courtship what is it called she said die I asked her do you want to die can you see you killing the hair and from that day she quickly came to herself she no longer used if God has made your hair a little brown brown it is beautiful that yes sir it's beautiful that way others have dark dark hair others have reddish hair others have a bit short others have longer but the way God has made you don't try to be like somebody else be yourself no one can take your place and you shouldn't try to take someone else's place don't be plastic original praise God my amens are not very many today am I stepping on some people's toys hallelujah hallelujah he C now this is in the message part perfect Faith he C me when I was nothing he C me when I was nothing I want to say even me he caught me when I was nothing you know when God is catching you he doesn't catch you for what you you will become he catches you for what you are because he wants to make you something you know God is always in a business of wanting to make something nothing something so he always comes to nothing show me has God ever come to something where was Jesus born naare what good thing can come from everybody despised the place he came to nothing he came to nothing he came for who the perfect the good he came to the Sinners you remember that woman prostitute when she was you know leaking his feet and you know they said we wish he knew what kind of man of woman but he had them as as the master he had them are you not happy you Ser a master he had them amen he said you've not washed my feet but since I came here this woman has not ceased to cry and wash my feet with our tears you know what you're talking about he comes to nothing he came to that woman she was nothing he came to Rahab RAB was nothing why did he not come to the best person in that he came to RAB a prostitute nothing because always when he builds he doesn't want someone to take the glory so God wants to build you and he wants to be the only one to take the glory God wants to look at you and say behold my work my finished work that's why when he died on the cross he said it is finished what is finished he has already built his church he has laid the foundation fin this church and the church only comes by faith through his blood and I am the reason of that death on the cross it's not my works that will make me make it when I say I know I can make it not by my works but I'm meaning I am going to make it by faith in the finished work of the CR so you see I have nothing to burst off but I burst in his love I burst in his blood I burst in his grace so you see he can he C me when I was nothing allow him to catch you when you are nothing because he wants to build you to become something and brother bam says I'm still nothing but listen this one oh my you better enjoy this one but I'm in his hands I am still nothing but I am in his hands I am in his hands that means I am not nothing if anything is in God's hand it means he wants to use it I am not nothing he called me and he loved me when I was unlovable he loved you when he was unlovable but he changed you just like the col sister said I am not what I ought to be and I am not what I want to be that I'm not what I used to be she know she had come somewhere something happened and that's the way it is if God when I was an alien from him so loved me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing he's seen something in me everybody say he saw something in me he seen something in you he had a reason to save you look at the people that that's unsaved today look at the millions you could have taken beside you but it took you amen no one can take your place amen you are in God's economy no one can do it that is his love to you praise God hallelujah hallelujah amen and I want to finish with this quote now he says Joseph another believer you couldn't help being what he was he was a prophet God made him a prophet he couldn't want to be different from his brothers but he was different God made him what he was nobody else could take his place nobody can take

all have a place some of us are evangelists some prophets some teachers some pastors whatever we are some Housewives some mechanics some Farmers Whatever It Is God has set you in your place Joseph was a prophet he couldn't help because he couldn't interpret dreams because he could interpret dreams he couldn't help because that he saw Visions watch how true he was no matter if it cost him his fellowship with his brother he was true because he believed those dreams he believed that that the dream that he had that they would all bow to him it came to pass because he believed he was a genuine
