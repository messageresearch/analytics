the Uganda Embassy and so they kind of gave them uh some kind of little holiday and so he's been with his bosses traveling around but there is no way he could be with his bosses during the weekend of

ethopia we love you all love you so much I want say something about Pastor when he Pastor came to he helped us to receive the message even though he didn't consider about the weather the country uh the language he didn't uh try to consider about that he just came by the leadership of God he came to the country uh with his wife uh and his family not uh thinking about what's going to meet him at at ahead he just uh believing trusting God that he'll protect him and he came with his family with his wife for us standing here it is the reason is Pastor [Applause] T he has done a wonderful thing in our country bringing the message the truth for us uh I really want to appreciate pastor we love him so much he still comes and visit us and help us also we love him and also I also love you all of you God bless him uh just to say something uh testimony I want to say a testimony uh uh yeah especially for young the young people yeah I want to say something for Young Generation God has a plan in his plan we need to wait we can enter into his plan when we are waiting for him after I received the message it was the plan of God for me to stop my work I used to drive a fuel truck big truck that I carry Fuel and transort transport it from many countries Sudan God spoke to me like I should stop this work it was the plan of God I heard God and I stopped and I sit and wait for him I sat uh wait Waiting for God for one whole year my life was staying at church all all for one whole year I was in the church Waiting for God I I pray I pray for for many things God also speaks I I I always pray on his appointed time God visited me God visited me in that one year there were things that would uh make that will make me to backslide that will make me to lose my hope but God helped me so I want to say trust in God yes wait for God when you wait for God God has a good thing for you yes wait for God after one year God has given me a job yeah I remember I remember also Pastor used to pray for me lot it's not like uh I was not like this today I'm not like this today back then God has made me like this today now [Applause] am we are not we don't look look handsome like this but then God is the one that made us look like [Applause] this God is good still the message the message has life yeah it's true it's true God gave me a job in the embassy God gave me a very peaceful job and also when you wait for God God has lots of in his store so wait for God for I I'm really surprised in what God did I I I was I don't speak English before God spoke to me that he'll teach me English he'll give me the language for in the embassy they don't speak Amharic they are foreigners they are ugandans so they speak English and need to communicate with them in English so I believe God in what he said to [Music] me God has taught me English so I am in a good position and I can communicate with them very well now amen amen we love you yeah [Applause] something he said you'll wait for his bride while she says something I also want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ uh we love you so much the whole church in Ethiopia loves you uh thinking that there is bride in Uganda it's just we are one big family one big body of Christ and we're are one and the same we're like brothers uh we don't feel strange when when we are here in Fellowship we're like one big family and we are are I see my sisters I see them my as my sisters and brothers they're like we're uh we are bloodly related with Christ Jesus uh so we love you all and uh I just want to give testimony saying um what what the message means to me uh at the beginning when I received the message I used I don't have many Kno how what the message is when people speaks about the seal the seven Church age all the things are like a mystery for me at the beginning but yet uh there's something a truth because when I just heard one word from the message something in me if you are a seed of God when you heard the truth a light will spark in your heart you it's like you heard your name is being calling and you'll jump Ah that's my name calling that is like when you catch the Revelation so it's in the beginning you might not see like you might not understand many big things like seals every Hidden Mysteries the 17 weeks of Daniels but when you like a seed when a seed is planted when a seed when a seed is planted when it's soed first it dies and then when you water it and the sun strikes it it will start to sprung out so uh it needs sunlight and also water for us we need to some to need we need to have some efforts for that seed to grow the seed of God in us to grow we need some efforts of ourselves we need to uh feed for the from the word of God from the message we need to look we need to search for God who he He Is We need to look for him we need to seek Him diligently we need to really know we need to we need to need him we need to seek him we need to look for him so he can reveal to us himself if you don't knock very well the door might not be open if you knock slightly like this no one will care who is this at the door or they will not think that there is someone urgent waiting for us but if you really know very well ah what's wrong let's see and we someone will open for us so we can knock at the gates of Kingdom of Heaven very well so God can open for us and reveal himself for us and I want to encourage sisters and brothers to know very well to seek God diligently so he can open for you and give you your desires of your heart and um for the for message for me is like it's my life I get to see who I am the purpose of God I get to see where I was how uh who I am and where I where my destiny is I'm not like a blind person I I'm not a person that doesn't know where he's going I know I know my destination I know I was in the mind of God before the foundation of the L the world I know what pred destination means everything has been revealed for me when the message came into my life and I praise the Lord for bringing the truth in my way because I I didn't go finding for the truth he the truth find me and I'm I'm I am so happy for the Lord God bless you H the church in Ethiopia greets you loves you may anyone who wants to visit to Ethiopia come to visit to Ethiopia we are most welcome to receive you God bless you just a moment uh there is something I want to say here uh brother DT uh there is a testimony that he gave when brother DT came to the message um I think it was brother giray who introduced you to to to us and then we shared with him the message Brother D did not have a Shadow of Doubt he he believed it immediately and he was baptized and after that brother dwit like he said he was driving long long Journeys but one day brother dwit uh something came to him he said what am I dying for you people you are coming here we were in the in the how is it called underground basement yes when the basement uh just like this is a basement I don't know what is about with basements with me so the church was in a basement and uh you know I believe that was the so seed sewing time and so brother DT felt that he was missing out when all the others including his wife at that time she was not married to him you know you know they were very busy fisting on the word and for him he was very busy driving going to jibou going to Sudan going to whever he even during that time he told me give me tracks I want to go and distribute I want to tell the people people about this message but still he was having hunger to come and sit in the in the church so he decided actually made a decision I was shocked he decided I'm no longer going to go back to that job I'm going to sit in the church I'm not going to miss Services H if God doesn't bless me that's up to him but for me I'm going to be in the church and when he made that decision he said one full year nothing happened but there is another brother I don't know whether you know him brother lisen you remember brother lis listen he was one of the first but I think he was not he did not stick around very much listen had come from another place in jibou I think he was working in jibuti as a driver so when he came to Adis he stayed around said Brothers Pastor can you help me find a job we said we cannot so he decided to leave the church and he went to do some other things uh not in the church but he was a very good driver so now when God came down God brought a sister she said I want a brother who is a very good driver we want to give him the job in the embassy and uh the only person that could come in my mind was brother dwit but brother DT did not know how to speak English so he did not have the requirements but you see it's not about the requirements that man knows it's about the requirements of God and and and brother D without the requirements of man God gave him that job amen many applicants had applied but all of them did not go through but the one that decided to serve God went through and when I go to Ethiopia these days I don't go like a commoner at the airport I'm taking a very huge car with a with a CD number plate and I'm taken all the way through by a man who is respected by the authorities and we are so glad for Brother D it praise the name of the Lord and uh sister faven um some of you and I'm saying this really to encourage our people here sister faven when um when sister y I think she was the first to come in the message and sister yodit how many know sister yodit a few here know sister yodit so this one is a sister to sister yodit a cousin sister to sister yodit so sister yodit brought her she said this sister will believe she will believe oh she loves God she will believe I love sister yodit is enthusiasm and so when we sat down with sister Fen she heard the message and she had and asked questions and you can see she she loves God with you can hear you and you can see that by what she was speaking here and she asked many questions but when all her questions were answered she said I believed I need to be baptized right away and from the time she was baptized listen her mother was not a believer of the message and her mother was not even accepting her to go and believe the message but two things I want to say about sister f which will bless some of you sisters two things number one sister Fe was at University but during the whole time when she was at University she never back sisters who at University are you hearing sister f Never Back le she in and it was very far away from home deborra Tabo I think it was 600 km from home like from here in Nairobi but she never back as sleep sisters who at University are you hearing this testimony say Amen she never back asleep but she instead invited us she would call me each time Pastor what about this this question I've been sharing with my friends this if you at univers and you're not sharing with your friends there's a problem with your faith and and finally she invited us we went there we traveled there I remember I traveled there with pastor morgus at the time and um and we encouraged her we traveled 600 kilomet just to encourage her and we traveled back again to Adis Saab number one number two but it was because of her Zeal that you know ministers or preachers are there God has placed them there but but your Zeal will make them will make God use them to benefit you but if you don't have Zeal like she was saying if you don't know seriously God will not use the preachers to bless your life so that's the first testimony I wanted to speak about the second one her mother I don't know whether you want this say but her mother went to the states and her brother went to the states and at that time she had even started friendship with brother DT and she said I and I'm not going to go to America because of two reasons one because I want to be in church because when I go start living with them they are not going to allow me even to go to church I am I want to be in church where this message is taught there she decided not to go to America H how many can make that decision I will not go to America because of going to church ah she made that decision decision number two she said I love the person God has given me I'm going to stay here I'm going to get get married to them and brother D and sister f got married and God has blessed them since uh with not only a baby but with great things in their life they are a pillar in the church there and supporting Pastor mgas in the ministry can we give a hand to the Lord for them amen God bless you God bless you so much we love you too like you said you love us we love you too very much praise the name of the Lord amen we we just so thankful to what the Lord can do and that uh he who called us called them and call is still calling there are many more that God is still calling you believe that with all your heart amen praise the lord it's just so touching let us uh let us stand on our feet we all right so I'd like us to sing Jehovah is your name brother Peter if you can give him a microphone let him help me sing that we just worship a little bit maybe for about 5 minutes and then we shall open in

because I cannot hear myself uh chapter 5: 6 now I'm going to read only in English and then you who are reading luganda you just follow along um it's we're going to read up to verses 21 I think that's much better now okay so reading verses from vers six and Pharaoh commanded the same day the task masters of the people and their officers saying ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick and here too for let them go and gather straw for themselves so I'm going to read from vers up to vers 21 so you just follow me closely and the tail of the bricks which they did make here to for ye shall lay upon them ye shall not diminish o thereof for they be Idol therefore they cry saying let us go and sacrifice to our God let there be let there more work be laid upon the men that they may labor therein and let them not regard vain work words and the task masters of the people went out and their officers and they spake to the people saying thus sayth Pharaoh I will not give you straw go ye get you straw where ye can find it yet not out of your work shall be diminished so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw and the taskmasters hasted them saying fulfill your Works your daily tasks as when there was straw and the officers of the children of Israel which Pharaoh's task Masters had set over them were beaten and demanded where far have ye not fulfilled your task in the in making brick both yesterday and today as here to four then the officer of the children of Israel came and Cried unto Pharaoh saying wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants there is no straw given unto thy servants and they said to us make brick and behold thy servants are beaten but the fault is in thine own people but he said ye are Idol ye are Idol there you say let us go and do sacrifice to the Lord go there now and work for there shall no stroke be given you yet shall ye deliver the tail of bricks and the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case after it was said ye shall not Minish out from your bricks of your daily task and they met Moses Aaron who stood in the way as they came from Pharaoh forth from pharaoh and they said unto them the Lord look upon you you and judge you because you have made our server to be abhold in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in in their hand to slay us I read up to 23 and Moses returned unto the Lord and said Lord wherefore hast thou go thou so evil inre these people why is it that thou Hast sent me for since I came to pharaoh to speak in thy name he has done evil to these people neither hast thou delivered thy people at all let us speak to the Lord for just a moment father we want to just say we are ready

action of faith that you will take and so uh just come expecting for what the Lord will do but in this service it's our end of your service but in my mind I have crossing over amen crossing over you know God has ordained times and Seasons it is all in his hands he knows what will happen and when nothing can take God by surprise everything God sees that is happening in your life it is happening by Design even sadness even Joy even when you're so happy even when you are so down it's all in the plan of God and so there are phases in our life that God takes us to and you know God does not give you everything at a goal did you know that because if God was to give you everything at a go then you would not trust him but God wants us to be in a place where we can always rely on him God wants us not to depend on our own selves but God wants us to depend on him that is why when when you ask things from him to some he will give to others he will not why because he is a designer of the heart God knows the status of your heart God knows if he gives you money to some of you you will abandon him you will not trust him again so you will pray for a full year God give me money and God will not give you money because he knows if he doesn't give you money you will trust him you will trust him you will depend on him you will keep coming to church you will be faithful so he will not give you something which will take you out of his presence you know one of them say Lord I think it was David he said give me enough that I don't beg but don't give me a lot that I leave your presence I believe that's where God wants us to be to some of you you will ask for something and you want it so bad but I tell you what if God knows the status of your heart is right if he knows it is right he will give you what you desire and I said everything you desire and this evening I'm saying God will give you everything you desire Hallelujah am whatever you desire as long as the status of your heart is right God will look at it and he will give it to you now he may not have given it to you this year but if your heart is is Right amen God works with you in phases in phases phas one phas 2 three but he planned all the phases before you were even born but he works with you in phes hallelujah amen glory to God and I was just thinking about Brother D the first phase God brought you the message the second phase you know God had to work on your heart amen for you to make the right decision to leave the job that was taking you away from his presence and you came in his presence with nothing that was a that God brought you to but then that was not the end God was still working and I want to say whatever God has done for you brothers and sisters it is not the end it is just the beginning of the working of God there are there is more God is going to we must be having expectation tell your neighbor have expectation have expectation tell your neighbor come on brother Dixon tell your neighbor sister es tell your neighbor Brother Sam tell your neighbor amen have expectation Sister Rose there is more God is going to do for you where the spirit of God is there is liberty and if you are free you will Sur tell your neighbor without being ashamed there is more God is going to do for us it is just the beginning and then from that phase came another phas God saw you are good you are depending on him he said now let me give you a good job a good job which will keep you in my presence that was another phase after that phase then he says Ah do I trust you now okay let me give you my daughter now and God gave you his daughter that was another phase brother can I prophesy to you this evening this morning that is just the beginning more is coming Hallelujah not only for Brother D but for every message believer today Hallelujah God works in phases God works in phases and now that we are going into another year we are on a we have been on a phase in our life and maybe waiting on the Lord to do certain things in our life but I want to uh have this inspiration as God gave it to me you know crossing over I just had those words crossing over everybody's talking about crossing over so I wondered why God brought it to my mind as well and then I felt crossing over not to another year but to the next phase hallelujah hallelujah amen praise God and so I want to take that so it and run it through with how God dealt with the Jews the Jews were a chosen people of God in Egypt however they were under bondage you may have been under bondage this year but I want to say you are a chosen people of God they were lost without God and undone you remember how you were lost and undone until when they were in Egypt for long for many years they were lost and done without God and God sent a prophet my God to those of you who have Revelation are already shouting amen because you are not hearing about Jews you are hearing about you I was lost in the denominations I was undone I was nothing until God sent a prophet in this generation and this Prophet that came he came with a message of restoration I say hallelujah amen we to have received a message of restoration we must be restored our hearts must be turned we cannot stop it and listen to this the devil cannot stop it see it this way when God met Moses and he told him I'm sending you to the Jews to my people God had already made up his mind and nothing can stop the mind of God the moment God made a decision to send Moses that moment when he made a decision to send Moses that moment God had seen that it will work out because Moses was from God and Moses had gone to only execute what God has decided now the Jews whether they accepted or refused they could not stop it the devil in this case it was Pharaoh he could not stop it now let me preach to you here here today at dvf here when God decided to send a prophet in our generation he had you in mind he had you in mind and not you yourself you cannot stop it you cannot stop the purpose of God I want you to receive this Revelation receive it personally in your soul you cannot stop it your bad behavior cannot stop it your unbelief cannot hinder God God will accomplish his plan and not only that even the Devil Himself cannot stop it because the message has come and the prophet has come with a message they must cross over they must cross over from Egypt they must cross over the Red Sea and they must go over into the promised land that was a phase in their life that they were in at first you know how they went to Egypt was through Joseph you remember how everybody was hungry at that time let me ask you a question who took the Israelites to Egypt answer me god so God took them to Egypt ah God took them to Egypt how many agree with me this morning you are not agree with me because you don't know how God works God took them to Egypt why because it was Hallelujah it was God who amen allowed the brothers of Joseph to sell him to Egypt and you remember brother bam says Joseph is the type of Jesus Christ and when they sold him and and and the Egyptians found him when they threw him down there and the Egyptians found him what happened they took him and he ended up into P I think P's house and while he was there you know the wife of Piper wanted to have him but he escaped her he said I'm not going to defile myself Joseph was pure just like Jesus Jesus was the pure he was the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world Hallelujah and then when he went to prison you know one prisoner was set free and another one was not that shows us Jesus when he was on the cross amen one prisoner was set free he told him you will be with me in Paradise in other words you have been set free you are saved but another one went to hell Joseph a type of Jesus Christ and then out of the Cross he came and what did he become amen he became a prince Joseph became a prince next to Pharaoh he was a prince among the people what has Jesus become Jesus is a prince Hallelujah to Joseph Egypt there were Gentiles they were uncalled people they were bad people to Jesus to us we are Gentiles we are bad people and called people but God in his Rich mes he called Jesus when he came down on Earth what did he do he came to the Gentiles where does he become a prince where did Joseph get a wife from Joseph got a wife from among the Gentile [Music] Egyptians how many receiving Revelation now he received a wife from the gentle Egyptians not from the Jews and Jesus is getting a bride not from Israel but from the Gentiles from me and you Hallelujah and he said there is something I'm going to do if you are my brothers indeed he said to them without telling them and revealing himself to them he said to them go and bring my brother Benjamin and when Benjamin is here I will tell you what next and let me tell you they went away and brought all the people including Benjamin Hallelujah there is a revelation but before Benjamin could arrive before Joseph would address himself to his brothers after Benjamin had arrived something happened Joseph told his wife his Egyptian wife go in the palace go in the palace take the children with you there is something I must do and Jesus is's going to do the same same thing the same thing he's going to tell you his wife go in the palace go in the Rapture I must go to my brothers the Jews and reveal myself to them when is he going to do that during the tribulation during the tribulation what is Jesus going to do he's going to reveal himself to the Jews but that will be after the Rapture so I am thinking of the Rapture I am thinking of the Rapture in a blessed home on Earth when the redeemed are gathering in the Saints will sing that answer they will be from all over they will not have church names on them they will have the name of Jesus Christ on them Hallelujah they'll be called a bride they'll be called a word bride are you in that number are you in that number sister I am glad I'll be in that number they will be from Ethiopia they'll be from Uganda they be from Kenya there be from America from all over the world members of the body of Jesus Christ Hallelujah am so it was in his plan he went to Egypt to find a wife so Jesus came among the Gentiles to find a bride and in the same way we can say that Jesus Took the Jews to Egypt it was all part of the plan hallelujah amen and now if God took them there it is up to God to remove them that's why he says when when he closes the door no man can open and when he opens the door no man can close now let me tell you while God works with you in phases when he opens the first phase no man can close and this reminds me when I was in the streets of Ethiopia one of the first trips I had there in 2013 we did not know where the Believers are but God knew it because they were in his mind before the foundation of the world I was just one sent there and I were walking on the streets and we had already been rejected by many people I was with brother Paul on that trip that was my second trip and we were walking on the street and then a man came and ped me on the back he said Hallelujah I said hallelujah hallelujah that's a good language so I said who are you who are you so we introduced one another so we went on the restaurant and sat down and the man the spirit of God Came Upon him and he began to prophesy I love prophecy friends true prophecy happens by the way did you know that that's why the Bible says we should CT those things despite not any prophesying I've seen people who are prophesied too but me I don't profess despise any prophecy because if you receive it it comes to pass and that man began to prophesy over me he said I see a light it's right here on your head I say it's a pure message God is saying I've opened Ethiopia for you and you are going to take that pure message in every corner of Ethiopia no man will close that door so I said amen after that I began preaching to him this pure message but that man never received it but God had the we in mind fa in mind God had many others in mind let me tell you this is a work of God it's not up to a man it is up to to God and God will call his own no man can stop it when the phase when the time for the next phase has come no man can stop that phase and by the time I left Ethiopia there were about maybe maximum 150 Believers but right now with all the testimonies I'm hearing I believe it is going almost to a thousand who called them not me not a man what is God doing God opens phases phases phes phes and even in your life who brought you where you were not you not an organization God brought you where you are now and I'm telling you it is time to cross over into the next phase Hallelujah and when the time came for Israel Pharaoh could not stop it the devil cannot stop this crossing over into the next pH your unbelief can't stop it hallelujah amen hallelujah my God amen I want to look at something here today in the message why are we not a denomination but bam says Moses sometime I look around and say you know that bunch of fanatic Pentecostals brother bham why would you ever go with that Bunch like that for you know what Moses looked upon the children of Israel he looked out of the same window that Pharaoh looked out of pharaoh looked at them as a bunch of mad dabbers but Moses looked out of the same window and he looked upon them as the chosen of God hallelujah oh glory to God you know when the devil looks at you the Bible says Satan is the accuser of the Brethren and you have people who are very good rumor mongers and they tell this they tell that and they break the hearts of people and some people become discouraged Let Me Tell those people are being used by Satan to to discourage people but let me tell you brother don't be used by Satan don't accuse any of your brother there's something I want you to get here the Bible says if any of you offended one of the little ones it is better for a milestone a stone a huge to be put in your in your in your neck and they throw you in the sea do you know what it means to God about his little one about his bride about his church to God they are precious far more than rubies far more than all the words put together oh I am so precious to God you are so precious to God and if you or anybody will offend one of those little ones that is the worst thing you can do and we see here Pharaoh was despising them he was looking at them as a bunch of M daers ah look at them look at the other look look but when the prophet of God came my don't don't don't close this open your heart to receive this when the prophet of God came he looked at through the same window what did he see what did he see the chosen people of God it's not about the the prophet it's about the message he has it's about the revelation God has given him let let me tell you Brethren this end time message is not William Bram no say what I said this entire message is not William Bram Bram this enti message is what William Bram spoke it was not his mind he has no copyright on it it is the mind of God and when it came it was the mind of God about his people and then through that message he said this if the people shall know who they are the bright shall know who she is and what she represents the devil cannot defeat her why did he say that because William bram's message did not come to tell us how bad we are we already know how bad we are are you hearing me each of you know how bad you are you know how bad you are you know how bad you are you know do I need to tell you you know you know how bad you are but this message come to tell you the mind of God about you regardless of how bad you are If the message says you are going to heaven you going to cross over from this world to another world it is th sayith the Lord and it cannot fail my God that is what the message is now the message gives us the mind of God and the mind of God cannot fail I see I see little Pharaoh little old Satan looking through the window amen that God is looking through and is looking through that window saying to you that you have been a failure this year that was just a phase they mad dabbers look at them look at them let someone tell Pharaoh that that is just another a [Music] phase you are a failure it's a phase what have you achieved this year it's a phase whether you have achieved nothing it's a pH look at you you have very many debts you are good for nothing it's a phase you've been in God allowed you to be in that face sistera don't the end it's just the beginning it's a phase tell the devil tell Pharaoh your Pharaoh your devil all of you know which demons are tormenting you and we have not come in a movie industry here today this is not a movie theater we have come in church allow me to bless those [Music] demons and help me to do it today we are believers are we not we are in church have the liberty and what happens let somebody tell that that little Pharaoh let someone tell that little demon that is you who look through the window that is you who look the window yes that is your way of looking you said I'm this because that's how you look but wait wait until my God we look through the same window what am I telling you this morning I am now you are Prophet this morning because when I ceas to speak my words I'm prophesying to you the word of God that's what a preacher is a prophet so when I say I'm preaching to you it means I'm Prophet sign to you hallelujah amen when Moses looked through the window he began prophesying those are chosen people of God allow me to tell you sister Grace you are going to cross over into the next phas that is what I've seen that is what God has inspired for me to tell you this morning the phas you have been on Hallelujah has come to an end this is an announcement this morning Hallelujah if you receive it you shall have [Music] it are you hearing me sister favor that phase has come to an end it's a new phase it's the next says now God is beginning and fixing to move there must be a crossover into the next phase of your life am yes you can receive it he looked out of the same window that Pharaoh looked out of pharaoh looked at them as a batch of mad do but Moses looked out upon them as the chosen people of God he know they had the promise why he knowed it by the word with a with a he says with this foot on the throne with his foot on the throne to be Pharaoh with all the world laying at his feet set there and power wine in his mouth and beautiful women to F [Music] him as the Emperor or the dictator or the king of the worldes at 40 years old had in his hand he looked out upon the that bunch of M daers but he know he was one of [Applause] them the world has a lot of offerings my sister my brother a lot of offerings the world had for most [Music] but Moses had Revelation for him he did not see himself on the throne of pharaoh I I don't see myself in the Throne of denomination I don't see myself in the Throne of the world and the joy the world gives but I see myself Hallelujah as one of the maders I am one of them and today I can say one of them one of them if you one of them you will sing with me I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them one of them one of I'm so glad Moses saw himself as one of them as one of them the prophet says hallelujah hallelujah he says that's it he knew he was one of them and by faith Moses he chose by faith he chose Hallelujah am but still phoh was saying no they M you cannot have them what phoh that phoh of demons of last of lack poverty I don't know how many are poor here today you may not raise up your hand but you know that fellow poverty is saying you're going nowhere M are you hearing me that pharaoh of of confusion of heartbreaks don't even talk to me I have a broken heart who is broken here I don't care how many pieces your heart is broken that is a pharaoh he will have to release you today that phow of sickness that phow of a problem may I have my problems don't even try it I'm preaching to you this morning you are either God's friend orer friend you either accept what I'm preaching to you as the word of God or you you don't and if you believe it Pharaoh must leave if you believe it you must cross over today your condition must release you today I have to have people here today who will say enough is enough whatever I've gone through through this year enough is enough I must cross over into the next phase let me tell you this is the end time message the end time message it's not just Mysteries which take you on the crowd you get a point the MTI message is not Mysteries which I'll preach here and you feel you can't understand anymore the end message is you knowing who you are is coming to that place where you realize enough is enough I must cross over into the next phase of my life why do we have believers who are very committed believers they are in church they pay their Ty they they they do their hair the right way they dress properly they never fornicate but they are bound you find them suffering why because they have intellectual Faith the any time message oh somebody must see today Moses took the entire message to Israelites who were in bondage that enti message had two things in it the first thing was to liberate them when they were still in Gan amen are you following me when they in gion they were supposed to be liberated time had to come when the Ang of death would come and they nothing would happen to meaning the calamities that fall upon the Egyptians God by the end message of Moses had to save them from it that is sickness that is poverty that is troubles that is your bad situations that's your tears that's your heart breaks that's all those things when the end time message comes that is the first thing the message does is to liberate you when the Ang of death comes he will pass over your house AIDS amen AIDS some of these sicknesses they are for Egyptians and if you have them today you are crossing over today the Ang of death must pass over you see this is a portion of the message many of us don't look at Hallelujah but there is another portion of the message we are crossing over into the promised land the promised land we must get there and to us our promised land is the rapture our Promised Land amen is the Holy Ghost which will be a requirement for the rapture so in other words I want all the aspects of the message be applied to me I I want when I'm still here on Earth to come out of bad situation amen but after I want to go to the rapure so I want both how many I want both here this morning hallelujah hallelujah amen and we noce here friends the devil thought he would keep them there all those situations thought they would keep you there but God today is taking you out by a mighty hand listen to this as I read it for you Exodus 6 you can put on the screen as the people will follow me then the Lord said unto Moses now shal thou see what I will do to Pharaoh my God just that portion is enough for me already let us read it together all of you read with me then the Lord said unto Moses now thou shallal see what I will do to pharaoh what is your Phar this year of 2023 maybe you want to encourage someone next to you speak on behalf of God and tell them now you will see what I would do to Pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land I am not going to stay in the land of the devil I am not going to still have a lying tongue I am not going to remain defeated this coming year I am not going to remain poor this year I am not going to amen be forsaken this year my heart is not going to remain broken this coming year I am not going to be depressed this Hallelujah am amen the devil will drive you out of his land he will beg you to leave that land he will drive you out of that land because you don't belong in that land Believers we have a land a land flowing with milk and honey a land of promises a land of that sayth the Lord a land of the message of the hour that's where we are going a land of the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen oh my there will come another phas we can no longer preach a phase when we are crossing over into eternity hallelujah hallelujah I am longing for that day P land I'm longing for you that time is coming where we shall just Rejoice where we shall just sing brother sister where we shall have one language that is not a mystery that is revelation it has been revealed already amen and God spoke to Moses and he said I am the Lord and I appeared unto Abraham and unto Isaac and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them and let me now let me now say it this way and God said to Moses I've appeared unto Abraham and unto Isaac and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty and unto Moses by Jehovah but unto you I'm appearing unto you by the name I've never appeared to any of them the name above all name the name Jesus Hallelujah am we are here we have come to a face where the final name of God has come [Applause] down it's no longer just Lord Jehovah Jesus do you know what Jesus means he will save you from all your s he must save you out of your trouble Jesus means savior I said he must save you out of your trouble come on preach with me this morning he must save you out of your trouble he must save you out of your problems because the name Jesus is a name above every name and every knee shall bow every time every tongue of condition shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord oh my good Lord amen you are you you can Rejoice Church hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord amen and he continues on to say and I have also established my my Covenant with them to give them the land of Canan the land of of their pilgrimage Where Were Strangers and I have also had the groaning of the children of Israel how many are groaning here this condition I want toship you see your great [Music] me bre groaning and the Lord comes down and he says I am the Lord hallelujah I've had the groaning of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians kept in bondage and I have remembered my Covenant God has remembered his Covenant where I for say unto the children of Israel I am the Lord and I will bring you out from under the burden of the Egyptians and I will read you I will read you out of their bondage and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm with great judgments and I will take you to me for our people come on come on receive it church and I'll be to you a God and he shall know that I am the Lord your God which bringe you out from the B of and I bring you into the land concerning the which I did swear to give to Abraham to isob to to I will give you the L I am the Lord I'll give it to you for an inheritage and Moses spake so unto the children of Israel they did not listen to him but listen to me this morning they didn't listen to him but still God fulfilled what he say whether you believe it or not it will happen and I cast that Spirit of unbelief out you must believe it the devil cannot release you willingly but when God sends a prophet with the message he declares the will of God even demons and situations bow to the will of God hallelujah amen Brother Joseph what is your situations what are your demons what are your failures and worries amen I say in the name of Jesus right now brother whether you feel it or not those situations as I prophesy to you they must bow to the name and the will of Jesus Christ God will take you with a mighty hand amen come on give him a clap of Praise this morning thank you Jesus you must take us out by a mighty hand and I said this message is the mighty hand of Jehovah God sent William Bram with a message it's a message of the mighty hand of God whenever you read the spoken whenever you listen to the text you are receiving the mighty hand of God is calling you out pulling you out he pulling you out pull us out Lord amen and God declared it and now it was time for the crossover to actually happen it was now time for the crossover to actually happen Exodus 14:1 I'm not too preaching to you my words I'm preaching to you the word of God hallelujah amen and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel that they turn and and come before between migd and the Sea over against Bon before just interpret here before it shall before it shall ye encamp by the sea for Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel they are entangled in the land the Wilderness has shut them [Music] in listen God is a very good strategist [Music] when God is about to give you Victory he puts you in a position to make your enemy think you are defeated yes sir he told Moses pass here if you and then between M and the Sea and over and you encamp around that area now when Pharaoh will see you he will say they are entangled in the [Applause] land they entangled in the land the Wilderness has shut them in that's the area that God wants Amen brother po that is what the devil wanted with your school right until you feel ah the land has shut me in have no way out I don't even want school anymore because my results are not very good yes you must read very well but sometimes even when you have tried things may not go as you are expected because the devil wanted you to get discouraged but I'm here to tell you today God saw it and he wanted you to be in that place so the devil can think that you have been shut in listen it is not for you to think it is not for you to think that you are shut up that you are you are being swallowed up God let this situation happen for the devil to think you are swallowed up for you don't think that how many are in that kind of place where the devil was telling you you are shut you swallowed up you are swallowed up you are swallowed up you are swallowed up no way out no way through the devil is telling you that because God wanted him to know that the devil listen the devil is telling you that because God wanted him to say that that's all the devil knows are you following me that's all the devil knows so he can only say what he knows the devil is saying we are swallowed up because that's what God wanted him to to see but that's not theend God is still moving God is still fixing don't believe the testimony of the devil don't believe it accept the testimony of Jesus Christ and I will harden Pharaoh's heart but he shall follow after them so now you were in a place I I pray you don't miss this church you are in a place where now the devil thinks you swallowed up and now because he thinks you're swallowed up he tells the generals let's [Music] attack in The Art of War in The Art of War the devil or or generally even not the devil generally when people are fighting usually you don't attack your enemy because you think you are powerful you go and read the Bible whenever an army fought with an army the one which won the Army were those who strategized very well are you following me you remember Gideon did you have many soldiers answer me Church how did you win how did we win God told him take away all the fearful I want the one who know they God they serving and remained with 300 men and when those men remained there God said it is now time he said remove all the others I don't want you Gideon to say that it was your power that some of you are crying about people who have left you this year yes yes people who have left you this year [Music] yes you're no longer even answering my message they were helping me don't cry sister don't cry brother God wanted you to be in that condition where you believe in in the people who where your faith is only and when you are in that place God is fixing to do something he told Gideon separate yourself from all the others remove all others I want you to know it is me who is fighting God wants you to know that it is him fighting this and he was left with 300 men and I think they were median ites they were all over the valley like cockroaches they had covered the whole place your enemy may be all around you brother sister but I'm saying don't you worry God is fixing to fight the battle Hallelujah and right there my brother my sister you know he told them put in the yeah in the ports and now in the pictures or poorts and I have a sword in the other hand and I want you to group yourself in three groups three groups and the first group will be by you Gideon and when you you do this they will all do what were they doing they were quiet everywhere lights were inside the pictures everything silent and the med were down there waiting to come and then Gideon gave the order start and then they started shouting the sword of gide the sword of God and of G the sword of the Lord and of Imagine 300 men saying that same words the word of the Lord immediately after that suppos b this the yes and when they bang it imagine 300 pictures breaking at the same time it was like thunder you one poort can break here and everybody say what is happening what is happening but 300 and being slapped by a [Laughter] sword Lord and as soon as they hear that sound from the mouth and from the pictures which are the light comes out the enemies of Isel began taking the man has very many soldiers the man has very many supps God wants your devil your demons to think that he has been overcome literally speaking you are alone no one to help you listen to me brother more with us than with them always God has fought with a battle that is not seen with which is not SE an army which no demon can see God will use that army of angels to fight for you you can read your Bible from cover to cover that is how it has been in every battle it was with Gideon even Joshua when they reach the promised land you remember in Jero he told them the only thing you have to do is run around imagine St St St seven days and people were laughing they started with laughing but by the time they they like but this is becoming serious they kept looking at the walls and as long as the walls were up they no problem we are fine when the devil thinks he has you that's the moment God comes down that's the moment how many feel like you are defeated I tell you if you feel like that if you feel this year has really dealt so badly with you I'm here to tell you brother sister it's time for crossing over because when they went over Jero around Jero the walls came down at a time nobody expected we can look at many other battles but because of time let come back here God told the Israelites go in that place where the devil and the Pharaoh will be begin to think the Wilderness has shut and when he thinks the wild shut you in then I will harden his and he will come to [Music] attack listen he had laid a TR for the devil he laid a trap for to and you have no strength to overcome he has laid the trap to make the devil thing you are not you don't understand you have no you have lost hope now you're going to give up the Devil comes to that is the biggest mistake the devil has made every time the Devil comes to we have no strength to overcome the Bible says the devil he comes he's like a roaring Li seeking whom he will and when he comes to you he thinks you you can easily be eaten can you imagine fortunate the devil making such a mistake thinking you you can easily be eaten and then he comes your way that's what he did and Pharaoh said ah the Wilderness has swallowed them let us go and get them can can we finish this chapter now follow me closely here and I will harden Pharaoh's heart that he shall follow after them and I'll will be honored upon pharaoh and upon all the his host I will be honored that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord and they did so and it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled and the Heart of the Pharaoh and the Heart of pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people and they said why have we done this that we have left Israel go from serving us and he made ready his Chariot and took his people with him and he took 600 chosen chariots and all the Chariots of Egypt and over every one of them and the captains and the Lord hardened the heart of pharaoh and he pursued after the children of Israel and the children of Israel went out with an high hand but the Egyptians pursued after them all the horses and Chariots of and his Horsemen and his army verse 10 and when Pharaoh Drew n the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were so afraid and the children of Israel cried out the Lord and they said unto Moses because there were no graves in Egypt you have taken us away to die in the wilderness where thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt whenever people begin looking at the shortcomings of their pastor there's a problem in their faith whenever people begin questioning their Authority there in their Fai you know those moments when the devil places you in a place where you begin finding fult with your pastor with the ministers even with the Bible with a prophet with a with with with the message with the scriptures I am in this condition because he's not good enough it is it means they have a problem in their faith and how many times people get to those places may we be pure Believers Brethren and Moses said unto the people fear you not stand still come on tell your neighbor stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which will show you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today he shall see them again no forever hallelujah amen the moment you cross over you will never see them again the Lord shall fight for you and he shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses where for Christ thou unto me speak to the children of Israel that they go forward the Lord will fight for you and you shall hold your [Music] peace ah hallelujah amen the Lord will fight for you Brother Martin amen tell your neighbor the Lord will fight you the Lord will fight come on encourage someone here at the end of this year tell somebody hallel amen the Lord will fight for you the Lord will fight for you brother Enoch hallelujah amen some over here the Lord will fight for you Hallelujah am sister peace the Lord will fight for you and you will hold your peace you will hold your are you sister over there I can't even see you clearly the Lord will fight for you don't you fear the Lord will fight for you I say Amen to that amen it is the word of God and the angel of the of God verse 19 which went before the camp of Israel now now I'm going to read up to verse 25 but I want to listen closely now we are coming to the end of the service here now and the climax of this preaching uhhuh listen carefully and the angel of God which was always going before the camp of Israel was removed and behind them now and the pillar of cloud went from before their face and stood behind them why do you think theill of fire is going behind us now why do you think we are not looking for the pill of fire the P of fire is here but the P of fire is now behind why because our enemy is pursuing after us and the pill of fire has gone behind us so that he can be between you and your enemy hallelujah amen that's where the victory is God cannot leave us to cross over we not protection behind us oh he's a marvelous God he's a wonderful godall amen the Peter went behind and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the Lord CA the sea to go back by wind all that night and made the sea dry l and the waters were divided let me prophesy to you now God will separate your Waters Hallelujah God will separate your water God will make a way for you where there was no way that is what he did for them in the first Exodus that is what he's doing for us in the Third Exodus he's making a way brother where there is no way listen to me dvf God is making a way for you to buy your church land God is making a way for your children School Feast this coming God is making a way and providing for the Youth meetings God is giving you knowledge in the school he's making a way where there was no way God is making a way for your business hallelujah amen where there was no way come on say amen I believe amen glory to God and the Egyptians pursue and went in after them to the midst of the sea even all Pharaoh's horses his chariots and his man I want you to say something here God made the way but the devil started walking on that way that is a big mistake for Saturn Satan if God has made a way for me you are not going to put your D Fe on this way if the devil does that it's a big mistake they thought we were swallowed they were swallowed but they will be swallowed by working on the way that God has made for us maybe Lord has made a way for some of you and you felt like the devil was interrupting you on your god-given way on your given god-given provision if God has provided something for you he says in his word the blessing of God it make Rich he does not add sorrow if there is sorrow in the blessing of God for you tell the devil this morning Satan you are on Holy Ground you are going to be swallowed up with all your horses with all your chariots with all your powers and it came to pass that in the morning Watch Remember here was Israel and here was the pill of fire and here was thep Egyptian and in the morning the Lord began watching looking the Egyptians through the pill of fire amen yes sir hallelujah amen that's what God must do today Jesus Christ same yesterday come on say Amen is the same yesterday is the same today if he look through the pill of fire he through even today he's doing the same he's behind you here and he looking at your Devils he's looking at Pharaoh through the pill of fire Pharaoh where do you think you are going these ones are mine you can't have them these ones are mine they must cross over they must cross over into the next phase they are leaving your Egypt they are leaving your sin they leaving your trouble they leaving your problems they leaving your lust they leaving all those demons they must cross over next pH he looks through the pill of fire and he says here and took and and and it says and troubled the host of the Egyptians by a simple look the eyes of the Lord are powerful let me tell you the prayer you should pray tonight God look at my enemies am hallelujah amen Lord Jesus look at my enemies and they began troubling what's happening what's happening and he took off their chariot wheels when God begins destroying your enemy Oh Glory God he does not destroy him once in a minute he beat Slowly by slowly oh my God he destroys one by one that's why the demons seem as if they not living because God is dealing with him by little little by little one by one will by Will Chariot by Chariot and they dve them heavily so the Egyptians said let us flee let us flee from the F of Israel for the Lord fights for them for the Lord fights for them in the realm of the spirit I can almost hear those demons say let us flee from them the Lord fights for them Hallelujah am

extending it over to the entire congregation may it be so for each brother each sister whatever they had left unattended to because of sacrificing for your work Lord may you take them to another let them cross over father it's you that will fight for us for we love you Lord with all our hearts have your way with us streng us father until we come back again in the name of Jesus Christ amen [Applause] am praise the Lord amen so you may be seated for just a moment so I just want to dismiss uh and reminding you that uh we are all coming back again at 7 p.m. forner at my home which is and then we shall be here at for the service so I'm going to request those who are going to come back I know all of us are coming back for the service but those who are going to be at the dinner to please register where is brother Jo stand stand up people some people don't know you some visitors who came for the first that's the brother over there so you just register with him at the so that we can know how many people to so otherwise um our youth meetings are [Music] here uh it's just 10 days 11 days to go 11 days uh I hope that each member here has registered now whether you've not yet paid the money or you are intending to pay the money just register we have a groupe group so if you're not part of it that's one of the reasons why you may not have registered yet because you don't know what is going on so you can see me after the service see brother martin many of Brothers they can help you join the group if you not part of it and show you how to register praise the Lord amen so uh the the our friends in Kenya several of them even from Western Kenya have already confirmed to come I see already about almost 40 confirming from there from Nairobi and and Western Kya as well as I have several who have confirmed from uh the um the the Eastern Uganda more than 15 I've already confirmed from where's the brother from where is he have you reged for the meetings no so 15 excluding you so you should register several Brothers we have is quite far but if you hear if you hear Brothers sacrificing to come it's a big sacrifice is almost at the bo of Ethiopia and Kenya sud you you know it's a sacrifice for them to come also we have our brothers that have already confirmed who will be ministering to the young people uh the brothers from uh New Zealand now brother Timothy also confirmed but a few days ago when I was in Kenya he asked me to pray mother in-law was sick and his wife and uh because if things don't go well then he will need to be with the family but yesterday night I believe it was when he told me that she is improving so you pray that the devil because I see the devil is fighting so much him from coming he already bought his ticket he's done his hotel and everything already taken the sh he has already taken the sh he's prepared but the devil is fighting from he told me these words the devil is fighting from all Corners to hind him before I had announced that these brothers were coming a brother from Mas sent a message that he had seen two brothers coming White Brothers so God had already planned it before is trying to hinder it it means that there is something going to happen so let's pray against as the plans of and sister f you remember the testimony I gave you of a sister that God used to speak to me when I was in trouble about how many remember that this is the sister right here this is the sister God used her and so sister God used you the devil is fighting this but he cannot Prevail God he cannot Prevail amen God is concerned speaking from people to people in Ethiopia Western Uganda many places told us what God is going to do my burden for these meetings is not really uh counseling is [Music] good celing is good and I believe pastors do a good job on that but the purpose I have for these meetings is not really counseling young people but it is uh to lead them to an experience with God because you see when you meet him everything else is solved and so we should pray and be in prayer for our children and other young people that come this is how God is leading us and we'll have service after service and with all the ministers who are coming men of God I believe God is going to them we have some young people coming from as far as South Africa Africa and uh and some from Zimbabwe so it's really going to be an international youth and the ones in ethopia have come early and are now going to go back ear but atast they will be represented by their pastor and his wife because you also take one of the meetings in the Mee amen amen so continue contributing there is a sister that streams our services on a regular basis and yesterday I showed it to one brother when she heard about um uh the uh our preparations she gave an offering towards the support of the young people a sum of about 1.8 Millions amen and that is in addition to what God had already provided previously so we still need a lot of money but our God is a provider friends these meetings are being organized 100% by faith most of the young people registering we have almost 200 now have registered but all these ones most of them are saying they will need F help to fully take care of one person at the meetings to rent the venue pay the food and the accommodation one person it will take a minimum of 120,000 and so we requested each young person to contribute 50,000 and then we as the church can bear the rest of the burden but even with the 50,000 many are saying when they that they will not be able to contribute all of it and others can't contribute anything at all but they desire to come so we are not going to hinder anyone from coming whoever wants to come tell them to come amen God is going to provide and we are not going to burden our visiting ministers like we did in the past meetings we did not burden them we took care of everything and we should do the same this time we should set that history having God provided for that not because of us but because of the vision that he has given to us God will support his own work and he will use people that are burdened for it so give and it shall be given to you amen amen so God bless you your all dismissed we shall meet at s take the name brother that where is he sister f please send ours to the church in Ethiopia our precious brother Pastor morus greet him tell all the saints we love them and we shall be with them soon God bless you you oh take it then wherever you go somebody help me sing it oh gracious name [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
