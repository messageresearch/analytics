[1:51:53] is it September okay we shall read the
[1:51:55] details for you when they
[1:51:58] get amen so this morning I just I got
[1:52:03] this
[1:52:05] inspiration uh when we were at
[1:52:09] home sharing with brother Joshua
[1:52:13] here and uh my wife and uh you remember
[1:52:17] Josh when I said I just got an
[1:52:21] inspiration something like that what I
[1:52:23] want to share with the church this
[1:52:26] morning and I want to title
[1:52:28] it go out
[1:52:31] quickly tell your neighbor go out
[1:52:35] quickly go out
[1:52:38] quickly now that's what I want to talk
[1:52:40] about I just took it out of the
[1:52:43] scripture and um it's not something I've
[1:52:47] made
[1:52:48] up go out
[1:52:50] quickly uh we were sharing about how God
[1:52:54] does his
[1:52:57] things and how God does a work that is
[1:53:00] short and
[1:53:02] quick and when God has you remember the
[1:53:05] other time we talked about the of
[1:53:09] visitation so really we still moving in
[1:53:12] the same
[1:53:14] inspiration when it is time for God to
[1:53:16] visit
[1:53:18] you he doesn't waste time he wants the
[1:53:22] to be done immediately quickly
[1:53:25] fast that's how God
[1:53:27] works God is not
[1:53:31] slow many times we feel that God is
[1:53:35] slow sometimes you pray and pray and
[1:53:38] pray for
[1:53:39] something and it doesn't happen and I
[1:53:42] know many of you are here and you have
[1:53:45] accused God of not answering your
[1:53:48] prayers and sometimes you you fast and
[1:53:52] it seems that your prayers are not being
[1:53:54] answered that God is not hearing your
[1:53:57] prayer because you prayed and God never
[1:54:00] answer according to you sometimes you
[1:54:03] want something so
[1:54:05] bad and after praying you don't get it
[1:54:10] and you feel this is the perfect time
[1:54:13] everything must happen now this way God
[1:54:16] is
[1:54:18] silent even when you are
[1:54:20] praying we saw last Sunday I think it
[1:54:24] was that God has a
[1:54:27] time God has a
[1:54:29] season of your
[1:54:32] visitation or of his visitation to
[1:54:35] you many times he will be
[1:54:37] silent but when the time has
[1:54:40] come amen he wants the thing to be done
[1:54:43] short
[1:54:45] fast immediately he's not a slothful
[1:54:50] god you remember I gave you an
[1:54:52] example how when God came down to
[1:54:56] Elizabeth you know whenever I think
[1:54:58] about that I
[1:55:00] Marvel I want you to imagine God
[1:55:02] allowing this woman Elizabeth to be
[1:55:04] baren for very many
[1:55:08] years she was a wife of a
[1:55:11] priest but she was baren without a child
[1:55:15] I'm sure she had a lot of people talking
[1:55:17] against
[1:55:19] her and she was praying Maybe
[1:55:23] but God watched over when all those
[1:55:24] things were going
[1:55:27] on and God did
[1:55:29] nothing God was silent God was
[1:55:33] quiet but at the same time there was a
[1:55:37] vision That was supposed to be
[1:55:39] fulfilled of a virgin conceiving and
[1:55:42] giving birth to a
[1:55:45] son and that was
[1:55:47] fulfilled when Mary came down now came
[1:55:51] to maturity
[1:55:53] I think Elizabeth was older than
[1:55:57] Mary much older than Mary but they were
[1:56:02] cousins so the whole time they knew each
[1:56:05] other so I want you to Imagine by the
[1:56:07] time Elizabeth got
[1:56:09] married God was quiet and Mary was
[1:56:13] growing God was quiet and and now even
[1:56:18] to the extent that now Mary got engaged
[1:56:23] and God was
[1:56:25] quiet and he waited at the perfect
[1:56:30] time when Elizabeth was
[1:56:34] available and Mary was available and
[1:56:38] everything was perfect
[1:56:41] aligned do you understand what I'm
[1:56:42] talking
[1:56:44] about first he visit
[1:56:48] Elizabeth of course the wife of the
[1:56:50] husband of Elizabeth
[1:56:53] and this man
[1:56:55] refused to believe the words of the
[1:56:59] Angel when he refused to believe that
[1:57:02] God said it's all
[1:57:04] right I will quickly pass over and go to
[1:57:06] another
[1:57:08] one and and this one while God was
[1:57:10] passing over this
[1:57:12] one remained
[1:57:16] dumb are you hearing me when God when
[1:57:19] the time of God has arrived
[1:57:23] amen you better have Revelation to see
[1:57:25] it because if you don't see it he he
[1:57:29] just leaves you he passes over you and
[1:57:32] when he passes over you he leaves you
[1:57:35] dumb he leaves you blind you can't see
[1:57:40] anymore and then he passed over this
[1:57:42] this one and he went over to his wife
[1:57:46] and told her all the
[1:57:48] secrets and later on we see that she's
[1:57:51] six months
[1:57:53] pregnant and of course we know how the
[1:57:56] story
[1:57:57] went that later on she gave birth to a
[1:58:01] boy and the man was still
[1:58:04] dumb until he wrote down on the paper
[1:58:07] the name the angel told
[1:58:10] him that's when God opened his
[1:58:14] M you see how it is
[1:58:16] important to discern the time you are
[1:58:19] living
[1:58:20] in to know what God is doing in that
[1:58:24] hour because if you don't you will be
[1:58:31] slothful yes and when you are
[1:58:33] slothful the angel will pass
[1:58:37] over and that's why many people have
[1:58:39] unanswered
[1:58:41] prayers because when God visited you
[1:58:44] were too
[1:58:45] busy you thought God should visit when
[1:58:47] you should
[1:58:49] want but God visits at the time list
[1:58:51] expect
[1:58:54] amen and and and this woman Elizabeth
[1:58:58] when a hard time came she was already
[1:59:01] engaged to a man she
[1:59:04] Lov but at that moment when the angel of
[1:59:06] the Lord came down and told her help
[1:59:09] Mary Mother help
[1:59:12] Mary they say mother of God but the
[1:59:15] angel did not say that said Hil Mary
[1:59:18] thou blessed among women
[1:59:22] and and then you know spoke to her and
[1:59:25] said she'll be pregnant with a child in
[1:59:27] a womb she said how will this things be
[1:59:31] she said the the the angel Gabriel said
[1:59:35] the holy spirit will overshadow you the
[1:59:38] spirit of God will overtake
[1:59:40] you now it was all
[1:59:42] confusing it had never happened before
[1:59:45] but this woman had a faith on Wednesday
[1:59:51] we talked about what faith
[1:59:54] this Faith was not half
[1:59:57] Faith amen go back and listen to
[2:00:00] the if you missed it it was not her
[2:00:04] faith we don't live by our
[2:00:07] faith we live by the faith of the Son of
[2:00:11] God you receive it as a gift of
[2:00:15] God Amen you know that's the same faith
[2:00:18] that um Peter received
[2:00:22] said Upon This
[2:00:23] Rock I will build my church and Byam
[2:00:27] told us this rock was
[2:00:31] Revelation and he said faith is a
[2:00:36] revelation I I know these things I'm
[2:00:39] going
[2:00:40] into somehow they are also deep
[2:00:43] Waters so I hope you are not expecting a
[2:00:46] a little Pentecostal message this
[2:00:50] morning God is maturing
[2:00:52] us we are stepping into those
[2:00:55] Waters where we should know what we
[2:00:57] believe and who we
[2:00:59] are and what we stand
[2:01:02] for praise the name of the Lord I'm
[2:01:04] happy to see you sister
[2:01:06] Angela so we see then that you know
[2:01:10] faith is a revelation of the will of
[2:01:15] God and without faith it is impossible
[2:01:19] to see
[2:01:20] God are you follow following me so then
[2:01:23] if without faith it is impossible to see
[2:01:27] God and faith is a revelation of the
[2:01:29] will of
[2:01:32] God it means Peter received that
[2:01:36] Revelation and there Peter had
[2:01:39] faith and upon that basis that
[2:01:43] faith God built his church on
[2:01:46] it and it is impossible to please
[2:01:50] God without that faith
[2:01:53] and that's the faith we're living
[2:01:56] by it is the faith of the Son of
[2:02:00] God it's not the faith that you walk up
[2:02:04] something and say now I feel
[2:02:08] Faith human Faith Can
[2:02:11] fail human faith will always fail
[2:02:14] actually but we are not living by our
[2:02:18] faith we are living by something that is
[2:02:21] gifted to
[2:02:23] us we did not even deserve it it is
[2:02:27] given to us by a Divine
[2:02:30] decree by Grace Grace oh Hallelujah
[2:02:34] Grace means unmerited
[2:02:38] favor we did not do something to Merit
[2:02:41] to Merit in ourselves or something to
[2:02:46] deserve but God looked upon
[2:02:49] me let me say it in personal
[2:02:52] God looked upon me and he had grace and
[2:02:56] grace upon me and he gave me that
[2:03:00] Faith simply that tell me what did
[2:03:03] Abraham
[2:03:04] do that made God call
[2:03:07] him Abraham was as bad as everybody else
[2:03:10] did you know
[2:03:11] that did you know that do you know did
[2:03:14] you even know that Abraham was
[2:03:18] drinking Abraham was as bad as the the
[2:03:21] rest
[2:03:22] he was not good at all but when God
[2:03:25] looked in the whole
[2:03:27] world he said I will go there and choose
[2:03:30] this
[2:03:32] man and I will call him out of there and
[2:03:35] I will set him on a I will set his life
[2:03:37] on a
[2:03:38] path and I will watch over him he will
[2:03:42] be mine and I will be his and we will
[2:03:45] walk
[2:03:46] together amen as long as he agrees so
[2:03:49] when he went down there he talked to him
[2:03:53] he gave him that Grace he gave him that
[2:03:56] Faith Abraham agreed Abraham accepted
[2:04:00] his time of his
[2:04:02] visitation and that was the beginning of
[2:04:05] great
[2:04:06] things a nation came
[2:04:09] out one who was
[2:04:12] burn amen gave birth to a child and a
[2:04:15] nation came out of it and the world has
[2:04:19] been
[2:04:20] blessed because of that One Nation I
[2:04:23] tell you it's the same with
[2:04:25] you amen God left others and he chose
[2:04:30] you he left another one he chose
[2:04:33] you let me first remove my
[2:04:37] thought Hallelujah hallu because when I
[2:04:40] talk about
[2:04:41] this amen I feel energized already amen
[2:04:46] God went
[2:04:47] around Amen in my
[2:04:49] family are you the only who was born in
[2:04:52] your
[2:04:53] family I ask you a question answer me
[2:04:56] are you the only member of your
[2:04:59] home Sister Rose were you the only one
[2:05:01] born of your
[2:05:04] father God mean in your family there
[2:05:06] were other
[2:05:08] children but God left this one and chose
[2:05:12] you left your big brothers and chose you
[2:05:15] left your small ones un chose you what
[2:05:18] am I trying to say Amen that you are
[2:05:20] unelect by according to
[2:05:25] Faith and if you are chosen by
[2:05:28] God how many believe they chosen of God
[2:05:32] if you are chosen of God God cannot
[2:05:35] choose you without a
[2:05:38] plan God chooses you when he has a
[2:05:41] plan God chose Abraham when he had a
[2:05:45] plan and Abraham accepted the moment
[2:05:49] Abraham accepted
[2:05:51] of God was
[2:05:54] activated amen people looked at
[2:05:57] Abraham they did not understand him but
[2:06:00] Abraham had a
[2:06:03] revelation not his own but a revelation
[2:06:06] from
[2:06:07] above Abraham saw something which others
[2:06:10] never
[2:06:11] saw Abraham saw a vision of his
[2:06:15] life Abraham saw where he was going
[2:06:18] Abraham changed his ways ABR his life
[2:06:23] Abraham walked in a different walk and
[2:06:26] from that moment God was leading him
[2:06:29] every step of the
[2:06:32] way I believe the same thing about my
[2:06:35] life I believe I am here because I am
[2:06:39] chosen of God Amen there is a path of
[2:06:42] life that I must
[2:06:44] walk and no man can close the door that
[2:06:48] God has opened for me no man can close
[2:06:52] the door that God has opened for
[2:06:55] you but how do you know it it is by
[2:06:59] faith and not by sight even if you don't
[2:07:02] see the
[2:07:04] door but you believe the door even if
[2:07:07] you don't feel the door but you see the
[2:07:10] door by
[2:07:12] faith Moses by faith Abraham by faith
[2:07:17] all the people that God talked
[2:07:20] about it was by by
[2:07:22] faith they they did great things by
[2:07:25] faith David by faith you know how what
[2:07:28] David did he killed a lion he killed a

[2:08:05] around them spoke to the
[2:08:09] opposite but amen but they were looking
[2:08:11] not to what they were
[2:08:14] seeing they were looking into what the
[2:08:16] word of God was saying for
[2:08:18] them there is something I'm trying to
[2:08:20] show you
[2:08:22] we are not just living
[2:08:24] beings that are born in the world to
[2:08:28] pass
[2:08:30] away the Bible actually says the works
[2:08:33] of the
[2:08:34] righteous they go ahead of them
[2:08:38] hallelujah amen we are here to live a
[2:08:41] life of a
[2:08:43] purpose we are here to represent what we
[2:08:46] were in the mind of
[2:08:49] God we are here and we leing by
[2:08:53] faith amen the many way many days the
[2:08:57] devil wanted to take
[2:08:59] us into
[2:09:01] accidents when we were coming from the
[2:09:04] East the car was parked and you know we
[2:09:07] were
[2:09:08] driving down a highway on a slop and
[2:09:13] then this man with a premium I think he
[2:09:16] just came driving and he turned and he
[2:09:20] stopped in the middle of Road
[2:09:22] and we were coming on that and there was
[2:09:25] another huge coming and there was just a
[2:09:28] small
[2:09:29] Gap friends if you would
[2:09:33] turn the car would
[2:09:36] flee our car would flee so we couldn't
[2:09:40] turn we just had to go head
[2:09:42] on and by going head on it means we
[2:09:46] would knock this man even if we turn and
[2:09:50] byass him the other one would would just
[2:09:54] hit
[2:09:55] a so why am I here all I know all I know
[2:10:01] the angel of the Lord was right
[2:10:03] there because I don't know how we
[2:10:05] negotiated that
[2:10:07] corner but I know he carried us we would
[2:10:10] have died we should have died but we
[2:10:13] cannot die until the purpose of God Amen

[2:14:02] supper then now from there you you go to
[2:14:07] the
[2:14:10] honeymoon the ones who are married

[2:14:15] processes the ones who are about to get
[2:14:18] married you going to go through it so
[2:14:21] but let us look at our
[2:14:23] spiritual now our
[2:14:26] wedding our marriage with Jesus Christ
[2:14:30] happens
[2:14:32] where at
[2:14:35] church while you hearing this words and
[2:14:38] you believing it you are getting married
[2:14:43] to we have passed the level of
[2:14:48] Engagement we are no longer just engag
[2:14:51] to Jesus
[2:14:53] Christ we are now married to
[2:14:57] him when someone just comes in
[2:15:00] church they get
[2:15:03] engaged so we have others who still at
[2:15:07] some other
[2:15:08] levels they are still in courtship with
[2:15:12] Jesus others have not even known him
[2:15:15] yet there are different levels we call
[2:15:18] it
[2:15:19] maturity but then you find that there
[2:15:22] are others who are
[2:15:24] engaged by being filled with the Holy
[2:15:26] Ghost but then you find there others who
[2:15:29] are even at another level amen of
[2:15:32] adoption now amen whereby they now are
[2:15:36] no longer called just

[2:16:00] the marriage
[2:16:02] supper as individuals others at
[2:16:05] different
[2:16:06] levels but generally speaking as a

[2:19:54] been come for all things are now
[2:19:58] ready and they all with one conent began
[2:20:00] to make
[2:20:05] excuses they began making
[2:20:08] excuses and one said I bought a piece of
[2:20:12] ground I must go and see it and another
[2:20:15] one said I have about five yoke of oxen
[2:20:20] must go and prove
[2:20:22] them and another said I have married a
[2:20:25] wife and there I cannot come all these
[2:20:30] excuses for people who don't want to
[2:20:32] serve
[2:20:33] God for people who don't want to come to
[2:20:36] the
[2:20:39] marriage but here is what the master
[2:20:42] said he said he was very angry he became
[2:20:46] very angry and he said go out quickly
[2:20:50] because his tables were
[2:20:52] set because his marriage supper was
[2:20:56] set right now we are eating a spiritual
[2:21:02] supper the revealed word of the
[2:21:05] hour we are eating a spiritual supper
[2:21:07] right
[2:21:08] now and he has invited everyone to
[2:21:12] come but very all the ones that have
[2:21:14] been invited to
[2:21:16] come have turned it down
[2:21:23] and then he turned to the servant and he
[2:21:26] said go out
[2:21:27] quickly into the streets and Lanes of
[2:21:30] the city and bring in hether the poor
[2:21:34] the maed the hold the Blind and the
[2:21:38] servant said Lord it is done as thou
[2:21:41] Hast
[2:21:42] commanded and yet there is
[2:21:45] room a prophet here in questions on the
[2:21:47] seals he
[2:21:49] says would the of Christ have a Ministry
[2:21:53] before the
[2:21:56] Rapture because we've had a people who
[2:21:59] actually now
[2:22:01] say and please I want you to be in the
[2:22:03] same spirit with me says that they are
[2:22:06] going to be you know after brother
[2:22:09] Branham there is no more
[2:22:12] preachers they are saying we should only
[2:22:14] put
[2:22:17] tis in church and there should be no
[2:22:20] preach
[2:22:22] how many have heard of
[2:22:24] that uhuh how many have not heard of
[2:22:27] it okay they are saying we should not go
[2:22:32] and listen to a
[2:22:34] preacher because brother Bram is the
[2:22:37] prophet of Our
[2:22:39] Generation how many believe brother bam
[2:22:41] is the prophet of Our
[2:22:43] Generation we sure all believe that
[2:22:46] William Marion Bram William Mar Bram is
[2:22:49] Malachi 4 fulfilled
[2:22:53] no one can replace
[2:22:55] that that scripture is already
[2:22:58] fulfilled but here he was asked the
[2:23:01] question would the bride of Christ have
[2:23:03] a Ministry before the
[2:23:05] Rapture and he said that's what is going
[2:23:08] on right
[2:23:10] now it is the message of the
[2:23:13] hour is the bride of Christ she is she
[2:23:17] consists of
[2:23:18] Apostles Prophets teachers evangelists
[2:23:22] pastors that's the bride of Christ she's
[2:23:26] got a
[2:23:28] Ministry a great
[2:23:30] ministry the ministry of the
[2:23:33] hour and then he says it will be so
[2:23:37] humble so now there is a
[2:23:39] Ministry amen that comes near or close
[2:23:42] to supper
[2:23:44] time but it's going to be a very humble
[2:23:48] Minister but also a very great minister
[2:23:51] I want you to imagine this it's going to
[2:23:53] be great but yet humble why because it's
[2:23:58] a Ministry of the
[2:24:00] Bride amen it consists of Apostles
[2:24:03] teachers Apostles
[2:24:05] evangelist prophet and he says here in
[2:24:08] the Philadelphian Church
[2:24:10] age it is to this age that Jesus
[2:24:13] says I come
[2:24:16] quickly that makes the last age a very
[2:24:19] short one
[2:24:22] laia is the age of the quick
[2:24:26] work it is cut
[2:24:28] short you know when God has reached a
[2:24:32] time of doing
[2:24:34] something God is always fast it comes to
[2:24:39] individuals is fast fast fast fast we
[2:24:42] have seen it we have tried to see it in
[2:24:43] several
[2:24:44] scriptures but now today in this service
[2:24:48] I want us to see in a way or in a
[2:24:52] perspective of a whole
[2:24:58] generation in the last
[2:25:02] age there is no other AG
[2:25:05] coming generation we are in
[2:25:09] now it
[2:25:12] is is the last

[2:26:14] F I wish we had time to talk about each
[2:26:17] of those but let me give it to you
[2:26:19] briefly
[2:26:21] just briefly I don't I'm not going to go
[2:26:23] into the whole
[2:26:25] details because I want us to get
[2:26:28] perspective the first church age well
[2:26:31] before the before the Jews before the
[2:26:35] Gentiles God was working with the
[2:26:38] Jews can you say Amen to
[2:26:41] that and the Jews were the ones that
[2:26:44] Jesus went
[2:26:46] to they were the ones that were waiting
[2:26:49] for him
[2:26:50] they were the ones that were waiting for
[2:26:52] the
[2:26:53] Messiah the Gentiles we did not
[2:26:56] know we were living in
[2:26:59] darkness but here in the Book of
[2:27:02] Romans chapter
[2:27:04] 11 let me just give you this background
[2:27:07] here for you to know what I'm talking
[2:27:16] about I want you to go to Romans chapter
[2:27:19] 11
[2:27:21] everybody open there if you can
[2:27:24] please and I want us to read
[2:27:30] um okay verses
[2:27:34] 20 I'm trying to
[2:27:36] see okay let me just read in English and
[2:27:39] then if you're reading luganda follow me
[2:27:40] because of time I want to read a few
[2:27:42] verses and I want to bring to bring it
[2:27:43] out all out so follow me closely from
[2:27:46] vers 13 for I speak I speak to you
[2:27:49] Gentiles in as much as I am the Apostle
[2:27:51] of the Gentiles I magnify mine office
[2:27:53] this is Apostle Paul speaking if by any
[2:27:56] means I may provoke to ulation them
[2:27:59] which are my flesh and might save some
[2:28:02] of them for if the casting away of them
[2:28:05] meaning the Jews be the reconciling of
[2:28:07] the world what shall the receiving of
[2:28:10] them be but life from the dead for if
[2:28:12] the first fruit be holy the lamp is also
[2:28:15] holy for if the root be holy so also are
[2:28:18] the branches and if some of the branches
[2:28:21] be broken off and thou being a wild
[2:28:24] Olive Tree W grafted in among them and
[2:28:27] with them partak of the root and the
[2:28:29] fatness of the Olive Tree burst not
[2:28:32] against the branches but if thou burst
[2:28:34] thou bearest not the root but the root
[2:28:37] uh but the root thee 19 thou will say
[2:28:40] then the branches were broken off that I
[2:28:43] might be Graft in well because of the of
[2:28:47] unbelief they were broken off the D test
[2:28:50] by faith be not highminded but fear for
[2:28:54] if God spare not the natural branches
[2:28:57] take heed lest he also spare not thee
[2:29:01] now verses
[2:29:03] 24 for if thou W cut out of the Olive
[2:29:07] Tree which is Wild by nature and were
[2:29:09] grafted contrary to the nature into a
[2:29:11] good Olive Tree how much more shall
[2:29:13] these which be the natural branches be
[2:29:15] grafted into their own olive tree for I
[2:29:19] would not bre that you should be
[2:29:21] ignorant of this
[2:29:23] mystery lest you should be wise in your
[2:29:26] own Concepts that blindness in part is
[2:29:29] happened to Israel until the fullness of
[2:29:32] the Gentiles become in now I want us to
[2:29:36] learn and
[2:29:38] understand we we should know what we
[2:29:42] believe all right can you now tell your
[2:29:44] neighbor I want you to know what you
[2:29:47] be I ask you to do that so you can
[2:29:49] activate your
[2:29:51] mind okay now listen closely Jesus
[2:29:56] Christ is is saying here is the Olive
[2:30:00] Tree and now the the the the Jews the
[2:30:05] Jewish
[2:30:06] Church were the the branches the
[2:30:09] original branches on that
[2:30:12] tree but because they stopped
[2:30:17] believing they you know when pet
[2:30:21] rather when Paul went to preach to
[2:30:23] them they refused to believe the word
[2:30:26] and they began you know confusing and
[2:30:28] refusing and all that and so Peter I
[2:30:32] mean Paul from that
[2:30:33] moment he told them seeing that you
[2:30:36] count yourselves Unworthy of eternal
[2:30:40] life it was good the gospel came among
[2:30:43] you
[2:30:45] first but you have counted yourself
[2:30:47] unworthy
[2:30:50] said L we turn to the
[2:30:52] Gentiles it was at that moment it would
[2:30:56] have been good if you put up that
[2:30:57] scripture can't read all the scriptures
[2:30:58] from that moment in the book of Acts the
[2:31:03] the the Jewish
[2:31:06] church was
[2:31:08] blinded as I speak to you
[2:31:10] today if you go to
[2:31:13] Israel the Jews don't believe in Jesus
[2:31:15] Christ as the
[2:31:18] Messiah they don't ah they don't believe
[2:31:21] it they
[2:31:23] believe in the Old Testament
[2:31:27] laws those who are
[2:31:29] religious the rest are
[2:31:33] atheists they're just
[2:31:36] there they don't believe in
[2:31:39] God they living in fields and all
[2:31:42] that what happened they living in
[2:31:47] blindness but while they are blind
[2:31:50] God
[2:31:52] decided by the ministry of apostle
[2:31:55] Paul to go to the
[2:31:58] Gentiles and now from the time of
[2:32:01] apostle Paul until today the gospel is
[2:32:06] among the
[2:32:09] Gentiles who are the Gentiles the
[2:32:12] Gentiles is everyone that is not
[2:32:17] Jew all the continents of the world
[2:32:21] they are Gentiles and we see we are
[2:32:23] Gentiles you are Gentiles your brother's
[2:32:26] sister Gentiles so what is it they were
[2:32:31] cut
[2:32:32] off they were the original
[2:32:35] Branch because of
[2:32:37] unbelief they were cut off and then God
[2:32:40] took went into the the
[2:32:44] forest he went into the
[2:32:48] bush and found another
[2:32:51] tree and cut off a branch from there and
[2:32:55] brought it and joined it to this one
[2:32:59] where the other one
[2:33:02] was Hallelujah and the other one was
[2:33:08] abandoned and now the one which is on
[2:33:11] the Olive
[2:33:13] Tree is the Gentile
[2:33:16] Branch who is that that is presenting
[2:33:20] the Gentile
[2:33:23] church but here has say you also the
[2:33:27] Gentiles don't begin
[2:33:30] boasting the root is not the one that
[2:33:33] you are not holding yourself
[2:33:35] rather it is the root holding
[2:33:38] you the life we have is not
[2:33:41] ours it is the Life of Christ is the one
[2:33:45] bearing us he's the one holding us he
[2:33:50] said don't
[2:33:51] boast don't boast because also you if he
[2:33:56] was not able to spare the
[2:34:00] original what about you who are not even
[2:34:04] original he will cut you
[2:34:07] off and then he will bring back the
[2:34:10] other
[2:34:11] one as long as they are not in
[2:34:14] unbelief but here he said when will that
[2:34:18] happen he has given us a
[2:34:21] timeline do you understand what I'm
[2:34:22] talking about he has given us a timeline
[2:34:25] and he said when he said when the times
[2:34:29] he says the the Gentile dispensation is
[2:34:35] over okay let let us read it together
[2:34:38] quickly he says vers
[2:34:41] 25 are you there if you're there brother
[2:34:44] give you to us on the screen I
[2:34:47] want this is now learning and I want all
[2:34:49] of to
[2:34:50] follow I don't want to be so fast and I
[2:34:53] Leave
[2:34:54] You verses 25 what did he
[2:34:57] say for I would not Brethren that ye
[2:35:00] should be ignorant of this mystery um
[2:35:03] lest you should be wise in your own
[2:35:04] conscience that blindness in part is
[2:35:06] happen to Israel until the fullness of
[2:35:08] the Gentiles be coming you can read it
[2:35:32] praise the name of the Lord so he's
[2:35:34] saying now here that the Jews are going
[2:35:38] to be
[2:35:39] blind blind blind
[2:35:44] until the fullness of the Gentiles come
[2:35:50] are you hearing me now most of the
[2:35:53] denominations are just they are
[2:35:56] Gentiles you know oh my there are many
[2:35:59] types here that are coming to me let me
[2:36:02] pull out one then I come back to we see
[2:36:04] Joseph Joseph was a type of
[2:36:08] Christ you know how he was
[2:36:11] rejected by his Brethren the Jews they
[2:36:15] rejected him they cast him away and then
[2:36:19] the
[2:36:20] Gentiles the Egyptians the
[2:36:22] Gentiles they embraced him and when they
[2:36:26] took him you know he became a great man
[2:36:29] among them do you know what he
[2:36:32] became he became almost an
[2:36:37] emperor he was a
[2:36:40] prince among the
[2:36:42] Gentiles he was
[2:36:44] respected he was even given you know the
[2:36:48] responsibility of taking care of
[2:36:51] corn in other words he was the master of
[2:36:55] the
[2:36:57] Harvest
[2:37:01] Hallelujah we are reading is deep I want
[2:37:03] you to follow me and understand take not
[2:37:05] if you
[2:37:06] can you know Joseph so he became the
[2:37:09] master of the
[2:37:11] Harvest he was no longer a
[2:37:14] common so when like like like like
[2:37:18] Joseph Jesus was
[2:37:20] rejected among the
[2:37:23] Jews they told him because pilot told
[2:37:26] them who should I
[2:37:29] kill
[2:37:31] Barabas oh Jesus who should I release
[2:37:35] everybody shouted baras
[2:37:38] baras they chose
[2:37:41] Barabas instead of Jesus and he said
[2:37:44] what about
[2:37:46] Jesus he said they said who the
[2:37:51] Jews let his blood be upon
[2:37:55] us and our children and the man washed
[2:37:59] his
[2:38:01] hands and he he gave them the
[2:38:04] license to go and crucify him so they
[2:38:08] began beating and then he went and they
[2:38:11] crucified him they rejected Christ in
[2:38:15] Broad
[2:38:17] de and by rejecting him
[2:38:20] you know what he did he also left them
[2:38:24] you know the
[2:38:26] Gentiles received
[2:38:28] him hallelujah amen when you go to
[2:38:32] America when you go to Canada when you
[2:38:35] go to Australia when you come in Africa
[2:38:38] when you go all over the world in India
[2:38:41] everywhere Jesus is on the
[2:38:44] top we have received him we have
[2:38:48] worshiped him we glorify his name we
[2:38:51] have even sung songs about him we have
[2:38:55] prayed to him we have done everything in
[2:38:58] his name because to us he is a
[2:39:03] Prest Hallelujah while in
[2:39:07] Israel is not revealed as we do
[2:39:11] here they are
[2:39:13] blind but Jesus has said here in his
[2:39:16] word they are not going to be blind
[2:39:18] forever
[2:39:20] there is coming a time when their
[2:39:23] blindness will come to an end but when
[2:39:27] will that time be when the fullness of
[2:39:30] the Gentiles has come
[2:39:34] in when that fullness comes
[2:39:37] in then he will
[2:39:39] come amen back to the
[2:39:41] Jews we see Joseph when his brothers
[2:39:46] came you remember when his brothers came
[2:39:48] and showed up
[2:39:49] he told them this is another good
[2:39:52] time he told
[2:39:55] them you go bring your my your last
[2:40:00] brother they they had to go and bring
[2:40:02] the little
[2:40:05] Joseph what sorry sorry little Benjamin
[2:40:10] I no I made a mistake there they they
[2:40:12] had to go for little
[2:40:14] benjam and and as little Benjamin what
[2:40:17] does it represent
[2:40:19] these things are prophetic by the way
[2:40:22] follow closely little
[2:40:24] Benjamin
[2:40:26] represents the
[2:40:28] elect from among the
[2:40:31] Jews just like we have an elect from
[2:40:33] among the
[2:40:35] Gentiles there is also an elect from
[2:40:37] among the
[2:40:40] Jews and they will be numbered
[2:40:44] even 144,000
[2:40:47] Jews and they are coming out of each
[2:40:50] tribe so he told them I will not reveal
[2:40:54] myself to you my
[2:40:56] brothers they never knew of course he
[2:40:58] was even their
[2:40:59] brother I will not reveal myself to you
[2:41:03] I will not give you food that's what he
[2:41:05] say until your little brothers come
[2:41:10] also what what does that
[2:41:13] type Jesus is not going to go back to
[2:41:15] the
[2:41:16] [Music]
[2:41:17] Jews until all the 144,000 Jews have
[2:41:22] been
[2:41:25] restored first physically the Jews have
[2:41:28] all have they were all over the
[2:41:31] world they had to come back in their
[2:41:40] Homeland physically living in Jerusalem
[2:41:43] in
[2:41:45] Israel that will be the time for him to
[2:41:48] reveal himself to the
[2:41:50] Jews oh the Bible says there will be a
[2:41:53] Prophet
[2:41:54] come and and their name is one is
[2:41:58] Moses another one is Elijah they will
[2:42:01] come to them they preach to them
[2:42:04] Christ but before he reveals himself to
[2:42:07] them do you remember what he did he did
[2:42:11] one thing that was very
[2:42:14] significant here is what it
[2:42:17] did he went to his
[2:42:20] wife and his children and told them
[2:42:24] there is something I'm going to do go in
[2:42:27] the
[2:42:28] palace
[2:42:30] the and then he came and revealed
[2:42:33] himself
[2:42:34] to said I am
[2:42:37] Joseph that's exactly what is going to
[2:42:40] happen Jesus Christ is our
[2:42:43] Joseph amen before he reveals himself to
[2:42:46] the
[2:42:47] Jews before he goes back to
[2:42:49] Israel he's going to Amen to take the
[2:42:52] the bride into the
[2:42:55] palace amen Joseph Married An Egyptian
[2:42:59] wife Jesus married a gentile
[2:43:02] wife we are the wife of
[2:43:05] Jesus we are not everyone
[2:43:08] hey we are
[2:43:10] royal we are married to
[2:43:13] him said you are Miss Jesus Christ
[2:43:20] and before he goes back to
[2:43:22] Israel amen there is a group you will
[2:43:25] have to account
[2:43:26] for that's the bride he will tell them
[2:43:29] come on go in the palace go in the
[2:43:33] palace to do up to the marriage sh of
[2:43:37] the
[2:43:37] Lamb Hallelujah we shall go there while
[2:43:42] he going
[2:43:43] now to Israel but during that time it
[2:43:48] will also be
[2:43:50] tribulation to the to the rest of the
[2:43:53] world there will be a Great Tribulation
[2:43:57] period we see that all the people will
[2:44:00] begin to receive the
[2:44:03] mark matter of fact they already receiv
[2:44:05] receiving it the mark of the
[2:44:08] beast and those who have
[2:44:11] it they will not be persecuted that
[2:44:14] much but those who don't have it will be
[2:44:18] persecuted
[2:44:21] killed some of them many of those will
[2:44:24] be the foolish
[2:44:27] virgins but now before all that
[2:44:30] happens he knows that is where it is
[2:44:33] going he says that until the fullness of
[2:44:36] the Gentiles be
[2:44:39] com how does it come in it comes in
[2:44:43] through seven
[2:44:45] ages seven
[2:44:47] ages seven ages es of the same
[2:44:51] church we call it seven Church
[2:44:55] ages seven Gentile Church
[2:45:00] ages amen we have the first one as
[2:45:05] e each of these age was signifying
[2:45:09] something and a matter of fact what I
[2:45:11] will tell you is that U these were
[2:45:16] cities in in Asia Minor over
[2:45:20] here and um each of them was very
[2:45:25] significant towards the future ages of
[2:45:29] the
[2:45:31] church and that's why God used these
[2:45:34] names of these
[2:45:36] cities or the churches in these
[2:45:39] cities to represent the fullness of the
[2:45:42] gentle
[2:45:44] church so when you look at
[2:45:47] Ephesus Ephesus meant aimed at and then
[2:45:53] laxed it was the first
[2:45:55] age you know full of the realities of
[2:45:58] the truth and the
[2:45:59] word and we see that these people really
[2:46:02] loved
[2:46:03] God they had the word was so
[2:46:06] pure but we see that that's also when
[2:46:09] the wrong seed was
[2:46:12] swn and like I said I'll just give you a
[2:46:15] tip of the iceberg I not go into the
[2:46:16] details
[2:46:20] and then Paul was the messenger but then
[2:46:23] camea as a matter of fact the word
[2:46:26] SMA comes from two
[2:46:29] [Music]
[2:46:31] words because
[2:46:34] m is a
[2:46:37] substance which was used to embalm the
[2:46:41] dead so this
[2:46:44] shows that uh uh it was also bitter
[2:46:49] so we we see that the church at that
[2:46:52] time started to experience that
[2:46:57] bitterness as as first Doctrine started
[2:46:59] taking
[2:47:00] root and um and and you know uh the uh
[2:47:04] the Bible actually speaks of you know
[2:47:06] this speed of the speed of nicolan we
[2:47:09] talked about it some
[2:47:11] back and uh
[2:47:13] also oh my sometimes I realize we don't
[2:47:16] get into these things
[2:47:20] there is a time in the lockdown we went
[2:47:22] through the church ede book page by
[2:47:27] Page and we were able to go through
[2:47:29] these Church ages one by one by
[2:47:33] one and so as I'm going through this I
[2:47:35] feel like I'm not doing it
[2:47:38] [Music]
[2:47:39] justice and I'm encouraging you if you
[2:47:44] can take the church ede
[2:47:47] book and read
[2:47:50] it but let me ask before we continue how
[2:47:53] many have read the church
[2:47:57] AG how many have not be raise up your
[2:48:03] hand you're going to see brother done
[2:48:05] here he going to make sure every one of
[2:48:08] you who doesn't have it gets
[2:48:12] it and read it because I don't have to
[2:48:15] rehearse these things
[2:48:19] soana was the second age and um and and
[2:48:23] then came
[2:48:25] pamos this is where the church got
[2:48:28] married to the
[2:48:30] state the false Doctrine is taking a
[2:48:33] hold the trity
[2:48:35] teaching and and you know and all these
[2:48:38] other false
[2:48:40] doctrines they started
[2:48:42] there wrong
[2:48:45] baptisms then
[2:48:47] camea speaking of the dominating
[2:48:52] female that is the spirit of the false
[2:48:55] Church dominating the whole
[2:48:58] world actually you know it already
[2:49:00] what's the biggest church in the
[2:49:02] world they are the ones who teach the
[2:49:04] wrong
[2:49:05] doctr the Bible speaks of it in the Book
[2:49:09] of Revelation
[2:49:10] 17 and says she's drunken with the blood
[2:49:13] of the Saints
[2:49:19] I'm all over the place today let's uh
[2:49:21] look at
[2:49:22] that it says and a woman was arrayed in
[2:49:25] purple and scarlet color and decked with
[2:49:27] gold and the precious stones and and
[2:49:29] Pearls having golden cup in her hand
[2:49:31] full of Abominations and fithness of her
[2:49:34] fornication
[2:49:49] [Music]
[2:49:53] the Bible says the filth of her
[2:49:56] fornication what is this
[2:49:58] filth what is this
[2:50:00] fornication the filth is the wrong
[2:50:04] teachings that are being given to
[2:50:07] people that's now they they're made to
[2:50:12] fornicate with those false
[2:50:14] doctrin this is spiritual
[2:50:17] fornication what they baptism of
[2:50:21] babies it's a filth of our fornication
[2:50:26] what are they baptism in the
[2:50:29] Trinity believing in three
[2:50:31] Gods what are they the FI of a
[2:50:35] forication and has made the whole
[2:50:37] world to drink from that
[2:50:40] cup filled with a fith of our
[2:50:45] fornication what are these teachings you
[2:50:47] know women preacher
[2:50:49] and they say it's all right and yet the
[2:50:52] Bible says it's not it's the fness of
[2:50:55] our
[2:50:56] fornication what are these teachings you
[2:50:59] know you have seen those
[2:51:01] scapular that they say if you wear this
[2:51:04] one even if you die after killing
[2:51:07] someone you go straight to
[2:51:12] Purgatory that is the filth of our
[2:51:15] fornication there is nothing like
[2:51:17] purgatory
[2:51:18] [Applause]
[2:51:20] our is here on
[2:51:23] Earth because the word comes from the
[2:51:25] world
[2:51:28] PGE means to cleanse to wash
[2:51:32] toy so they believe that when you die
[2:51:37] and you go to hell a priest will come
[2:51:40] after they have given him money he will
[2:51:43] light some
[2:51:44] candles he will pray some prayers and
[2:51:48] your soul
[2:51:49] will be taken from hell and will be
[2:51:52] brought to
[2:51:53] Purgatory not heaven but also not hell
[2:51:58] in the middle middle there there but
[2:52:00] that's false
[2:52:01] teachings is the fithness of our
[2:52:05] fornication Hallelujah we believe our
[2:52:08] patory is here where we are being washed
[2:52:12] where we are being cleansed where we are
[2:52:15] being
[2:52:16] purified and after we die we know we are
[2:52:19] where we are going we are going in the
[2:52:22] presence of
[2:52:23] God praise the name of the Lord and and
[2:52:26] we see that they have told those
[2:52:28] things and and people are thirsty and
[2:52:31] hungering for the
[2:52:33] word but that Spirit you know fill the
[2:52:37] whole
[2:52:38] world during it filled the whole world
[2:52:40] during the age of
[2:52:43] 30 that is when they would even kill
[2:52:45] people physically for not being part of
[2:52:48] their
[2:52:50] assist praise the name of the Lord and
[2:52:52] then came
[2:52:54] sadis and after sadis came
[2:52:57] philadel a great missionary

[2:53:04] ages we have reached

[2:53:13] church and we are

[3:01:06] believe they will come in and there will
[3:01:09] be the shining stars in your
[3:01:12] [Music]
[3:01:15] crown it's an Urgent Message
[3:01:19] he says all things are now
[3:01:22] ready do we believe all things are now
[3:01:26] ready ah Malachi 45 says behold I'll
[3:01:30] send you Elijah the
[3:01:32] prophet before the coming of the Great
[3:01:34] and the Dreadful day of the
[3:01:36] Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the
[3:01:38] fathers to the children and the hearts
[3:01:41] of the children to their
[3:01:42] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[3:01:48] this prophecy is
[3:01:52] fulfilled John the
[3:01:54] Baptist fulfill the first
[3:01:57] portion which says he shall turn the
[3:01:59] hearts of the fathers to the
[3:02:02] children what does that
[3:02:04] mean the fathers here is talking of the
[3:02:09] the the fathers of the
[3:02:12] law the ones who believed in the Lord
[3:02:16] the ones who submitted themselves to the
[3:02:18] Lord the phes and
[3:02:21] sedes John's Ministry turned their
[3:02:25] hearts to
[3:02:28] Children meaning
[3:02:30] Christ because Jesus was just a child
[3:02:34] and his faith was like that that he said
[3:02:36] is like that of Little
[3:02:39] Children he said that the kingdom of God
[3:02:42] is like an little
[3:02:44] child and if you do not be like a child
[3:02:47] you will never inherit the kingdom of
[3:02:49] God so he came like that in
[3:02:53] humility and this
[3:02:56] Pharisees John preached to them
[3:03:00] repent the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[3:03:03] hand and by so doing he turned the
[3:03:05] hearts of the
[3:03:07] fathers to Christ and then we see from
[3:03:11] the law to
[3:03:13] Grace but then the Bible continues on
[3:03:17] when he says and also the heart of the
[3:03:19] children to their
[3:03:22] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[3:03:24] to
[3:03:25] the if this doesn't
[3:03:28] happen the whole world would be
[3:03:31] cast don't listen to
[3:03:34] someone who tells you Elijah Ministry is
[3:03:36] not
[3:03:40] important because the Bible is saying if
[3:03:43] Elijah does not
[3:03:45] come and turn the children the hearts of
[3:03:47] the children to the
[3:03:49] Father the whole world will be
[3:03:53] cast
[3:03:56] imagine do you remember someone else who
[3:03:58] gave a
[3:04:00] cur it was Paul he said if anyone teach
[3:04:03] another
[3:04:04] gospel then what we have preached to you
[3:04:08] let him be Cur so there are many
[3:04:10] preachers today who are under a
[3:04:12] curse for preaching
[3:04:15] teachings that Paul never preached
[3:04:19] if they support women
[3:04:20] preachers if they baptize
[3:04:23] wrong if they don't believe in the
[3:04:25] things
[3:04:26] that they don't believe in one God they
[3:04:30] literally under that
[3:04:32] c and so you see why this Prophet had to
[3:04:37] come is to hinder people from going
[3:04:39] under that
[3:04:41] Cur because the ministry of
[3:04:45] Elijah will restore all things
[3:04:49] he says here he shall turn the hearts of
[3:04:51] the children to their
[3:04:53] fathers so today we are the children of
[3:04:56] God we are the children of God our
[3:05:00] hearts have been
[3:05:02] turned to our fathers our fathers are
[3:05:07] those ones who were once who children
[3:05:12] now and they grew and became our fathers
[3:05:17] the
[3:05:18] apostles so we are
[3:05:20] turned back to the faith of the
[3:05:23] Apostles back to the teachings of Peter
[3:05:26] back to the teachings of Paul back to
[3:05:28] all the original
[3:05:30] faith and and the Elijah
[3:05:33] Ministry is coming to turn our hearts
[3:05:37] back in Matthew
[3:05:41] 17:10 and his disciples asked him
[3:05:44] saying why then say the scribes that
[3:05:46] Elias must
[3:05:52] and Jesus answered and said unto
[3:05:54] them's truly shall first
[3:05:57] come and restore all things and I also
[3:06:01] want to say Eliah truly has come
[3:06:04] already tell your neighbor Elias has
[3:06:06] come
[3:06:08] already amen Elijah is come already all
[3:06:12] things are ready
[3:06:14] now someone didn't get it because Jesus
[3:06:17] said go out
[3:06:19] quickly because all things are ready now
[3:06:23] the time for the marriage supper
[3:06:25] said go out quickly call them and when
[3:06:29] they didn't come you know he told okay
[3:06:32] go to the streets call the name call the
[3:06:34] poor call everybody and he said we have
[3:06:37] done it and here they are and I can say
[3:06:41] here they are we have come but then he
[3:06:44] said and yet there is
[3:06:50] room there's a song we used to
[3:06:52] sing if you know it you can sing it with
[3:06:54] me room
[3:06:57] room yes there's room there's room found
[3:07:04] for thee Oh
[3:07:08] room
[3:07:10] room yes there is room there's a room at
[3:07:14] the fountain for thee
[3:07:20] there is room for everyone that can come
[3:07:24] in hallelujah amen and while I want to
[3:07:27] conclude not the sermon but just the
[3:07:30] service
[3:07:31] today you know he says here Elijah elah
[3:07:35] truly shall first
[3:07:37] come and restore all things and I said
[3:07:40] to you today that Elijah Ministry was
[3:07:45] fulfilled in the ministry of William
[3:07:49] Elijah has
[3:07:52] come if you believe it your amens would
[3:07:55] have been much better than
[3:07:58] that hallelujah amen we are a bunch of
[3:08:01] people who believe
[3:08:04] that Elijah has
[3:08:06] come amen and all things are now
[3:08:09] ready because when he comes he will
[3:08:12] restore all
[3:08:14] things he set the church in order
[3:08:18] the right teaching on the
[3:08:19] godhead the right teaching on Holiness
[3:08:22] the right teaching on the church
[3:08:25] ages on the ministry the order the
[3:08:29] gifts everything the everything is now
[3:08:32] ready the ground has been
[3:08:35] set amen I'm thinking of the
[3:08:38] Rapture in
[3:08:40] blessed the only thing remaining is for
[3:08:44] the bride to go to the marriage supper
[3:08:48] but just before we go there is just a
[3:08:51] little more
[3:08:53] room I just pray that someone will catch
[3:08:55] a burden
[3:08:57] today I'd like us at this moment to
[3:09:00] stand on our
[3:09:01] feet just change position a little
[3:09:06] bit if you can just
[3:09:09] stand the musicians could come
[3:09:23] the scripture in Revelation 19
[3:09:26] says let us be glad and
[3:09:29] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[3:09:32] marriage of the Lamb is
[3:09:34] come and his wife has made
[3:09:39] herself I don't know whether his wife is
[3:09:41] ready
[3:09:43] tonight and to her was granted that she
[3:09:45] should be arrayed in finally
[3:09:51] clean and
[3:09:53] white for the fin L is the righteousness
[3:09:56] of the
[3:09:59] saint and he saith unto me right blessed
[3:10:02] are they which are called unto the
[3:10:04] marriage supper
[3:10:10] of blessed are they are you called to
[3:10:13] the marriage
[3:10:15] of the Bible says blessed are
[3:10:18] you blessed are
[3:10:20] you if you called to the marriage supper
[3:10:22] of the
[3:10:25] land while we close our eyes for a
[3:10:34] moment I'd like each of us to
[3:10:39] meditate about our life about your life
[3:10:47] you know when the
[3:10:50] master when he called the servant to for
[3:10:54] him to go and bring in those who were
[3:11:00] invited they all give
