Shall we turn to our Bible in the book of Matthew chapter 28? Amen. [Music] We are reading from verse one say that in the end of Sabbath as it began to down toward the first day of the week came Mary Magdalene and other Mary to see uh the supplicer and behold there was a great earthquake for uh and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon on it. His godness was like lightening and his remnant white as snow. And the fear of him, the fear of him the keeper did shake and became as dead men. And the angel answered and said unto the woman, "Fear not ye, for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified." And he said, "Not here, for he is risen." And he said, "Come see the place where uh see the place where the Lord lay and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead. And behold, he goeth before you into Galilee. There shall ye see him. Lo, I have told you." And they departed quickly from the supplicer word. And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet and worshiped him. Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid. Go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there they shall see me. And now when they were going, behold, some of them watched, came into the city, and showed unto and showed unto the chief priest all the things that were done. And then they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, and they gave large money unto the soldiers, saying, Say ye his disciple, came by night, and stole him away while we slept. Ginger. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign [Music] speech. foreign. [Music] [Music] for neverchee. [Music] [Music] for speech. You may have your seats. Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. You can see where corruption started. You can see where bribe started. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Are you happy this morning? I am glad to tell you that Jesus rose from the dead. Amen. The other day on Good Friday near my place there. There is a Pentecostal church there. And I was so shocked. I thought maybe uh they turn it into a a video hall. Then I came to realize uh that they were they had put I think the movie called Passion of Christ. Praise be to God. But I thank God that we know much better than that. Praise be to God. Amen. And people were holding on their cheek. Others were even crying. They beating him. God does not want us sympathize with him. Amen. Praise be to God. He never sent us to play those movies on Good Friday. But he told us to go and preach the gospel. guide therefore into the world preach the gospel. Whosoever believes and baptiz shall be saved. Amen. And this morning I want to talk about resurrection. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Thousands and millions of sermon have been preached about resurrection. And you know in such a day there are many things which comes in our mind. Praise be to God. The brother preached many sermons on this day like the Easter Seals the resurrection of Jesus among others. Blessed be the name of the Lord. But if you go reading through those messages it's like you speak about one thing. Amen. Praise the Lord. Talk of the mighty conqueror. Praise be to God. Amen. But say that resurrection uh you see that resurrection means to bring you back to what you were. When Jesus resurrected from the [Music] dead, he did not become another human being, but was the same Jesus in in another form or in a real real form because remember where Jesus came. Jesus was the temple where God dwelt. and to cover the sins of the world. Amen. Remember the Bible tells us in John 4:24 that God is a spirit. Amen. God is a what? But when man sinned, we needed a kinsman's redeemer. [Music] So that God put on flesh came and dwelt among us. The only we could pay for our sins was through him putting on flesh. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. So Jesus carried our sins upon him. And he was rejected by God. And even the world itself rejected. And he was in he was crucified in between uh in between the heavens and the earth. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And that's why you are seated here this morning because that's where our hope lies. If Jesus was not resurrected, ah that would be bad news. We not be here today. But when Jesus rose from the dead, he told them one time destroy this temple just in three days. I will bring it up again. And here. Amen. And today it was like today when Jesus proved that. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. That Jesus was killed. He died on Good Friday. He was Saturday and on Sunday morning. Hallelujah. We are seeing these ladies Mary. They went to the tomb and when they reached there they found a young man. Amen. Seated on the tomb on that stone. The stone was rolled away and they asked him. No, he rather told them what they are do what they are seeking. He's not here. He said, "The Lord is risen." Praise be to God. And I'm here this morning to tell you that the Lord is risen. And that Jesus is not in heaven. He's dwelling in our hearts tonight because that's where God want to be. Blessed be the name of the Lord. One time David wanted to build uh God a house and the Lord told him, "Praise be to God." The Lord told him, "Heaven is my foottool, heaven is my throne and the earth is my foottool, which house will you build?" But thanks be to God, that same God whose earth is bestowed and heaven is strong. Amen. He has decided to dwell in our hearts. Amen. Oh, how mysterious is the heart of man that great God will come and dwell in our soul. Praise be to God. Amen. Amen. Resurrection means bring you back to what you are or what you was at birth. What was at birth? Not this physical birth, but there's what we were before the foundation of the world. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And that's why Jesus said, you must be born again because you bypassed your birth. And through new birth, we are restored back to the original birth. Blessed be the name of the Lord. says that what is it? There's been a sentence claim and Easter claim the flower claims. It has a right to rise again. And God's law of nature pulls the earth around and make that law of God. in nature bring forth an Easter resurrection. It is beautifully. It's beautifully the return of the sun to restore what winter killed. what it was from. Oh, sorry. While it was from the earth, blessed be the name of God. That is the message, the resurrection of the bridegroom that during the winter. We know that uh trees will shed off their leaves because it's approaching winter time. The life will go back to the root. Blessed be the name of the Lord and that tree will die. But after the winter, Amen. praise be to God. During the spring time, now that tree will grow back again. Blessed be the name of God. You see, nature teaches us But say that when you look at the tree, the way the tree is toiling, the tree we are seeing today is the negative of the original tree. Amen. Do you know that there is a land whose tree does not shed in his leaves? There is a line where there is no son. It is son is the son of God. Praise be to God. And that is the land we are longing for. That is the city praying for. The Bible tells us that Abraham, Amen, the Bracks, they moved. They lived in ships came in the desert looking for a city builder and maker was God himself. Amen. Amen. When God called Abraham and gave a promise, a promise of of a promised land, praise be to God, inside Abraham, there was something longing. Amen. And that's why the Bible say they lived in sheep skin. They never mind about themselves. about that city whose builder and maker is God. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And here comes the Lord Jesus. And he says, I am the way. I am the truth and the life. Nobody goes the father but by me. Praise be to God. When Jesus went to the grave, and rose again. When Jesus comes and preach resurrection there we know it is a sure deal he has tested he has shown us even when we die we shall rise again. Amen. Amen. And we are believers of resurrection. We are the candidates of resurrection because our Jesus died and rose again. Blessed be the name of amen. We have a better hope. Even that's why even when we are sick we pray and quote God in this word. what you say by your strength. I am and we believe in the word and I profess it. We walk by it. Our body respond because inside us we have a law of resurrection. Yes sir. Praise be to God. God has put that law in us. The law which defy the gravity Praise be to God. Amen. I read somewhere the prophet say that when God heals you from a certain disease, you cannot die of that same disease again. That is our God. You cannot be healed of cancer. And you believe God and God heals of cancer. That can happen. Praise be to God. The God we are serving. My my my praise be to God. Talk of that great [Applause] warrior. If you can just believe, if you can just look back, we are not here to sympathize. Start crying. He died. He even prayed and cried. [Music] Do you know why he cried? Do you know why he cried? Let me tell you why Jesus cried. Praise be to God. When Jesus prayed in God's name until his sweat turn into blood and say, "Father, if it is possible, pass this cup away from me. It was in pain. You know why he cried? When he looked back and looked inongo and saw brother Matthew they struggling with sin struggling to do life and when he look back before the foundation of the world. Amen. Anywhere in the in the lamb's book of life, he realized my name was praise be to God. Amen. He was in between that decision either he he quit the cross or he take the but when he looked at you how you are struggling down there and saw where you are you are with him. of the world. Father will be done. Praise be to God. You are the will of God. Your will be the will of God. Praise be to God. Amen. Amen. Is for us to be restored back. God is happy to see us. We are like Adam. Remember when God created creation, he never named them. We know their name. Praise be to God. But God had adopted who was just like him. Praise be to God. I believe before Adam before Adam looked at Adam's nose was like God's nose was his praise be to God and maybe that day he came with a challenge they said what are you seeing here I'm seeing the beauty of your creation what we little today I'm going to give you a task you are going to give them names he said glory glory hallelujah amen maybe Adam before that time the lion moving and he saw the way it is the way he was waiting for the right time and when that right time came What is that? You say that word. Hallelujah. Amen. That will be called a lion said, "Amen." Hallelujah. Praise be to God. [Music] Elephant. This is not a cow. Still huge with a trunk with a big ears. You be called elephant and it was perfect. Try to call cow elephant and see there's not even much. Praise be to God. So we're in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and we found ourselves chained in sin and we had no way out. from the prophets. They hold them in prison. Hallelujah. Amen. We needed a redeemer. We needed a savior. We need a champion of the champion. Hallelujah. They search through the earth. There was not even one. that Adam fertain point Adam had to fail. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise be to God. Talk of the prophets. Amen. Even the prophets they fa. Amen. There are giants on earth. God never picked one. God had his giant and that giant called the lamb. He's the lion of the tribe of the pillar of fire and the morning star of the valley. Hallelujah. He was wrapped with everything. Amen. Amen. And when he was called out, it was the perfect match. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let the devil not lie. Yesterday uh one preacher was telling us how stinking the devil is. I I I felt the guy smelling but sometime is so really so hurting to see a believer in church like this in a service like this is if you know that the devil is smelling near brother or sister. You see that person ate that person. Oh, it's on WhatsApp. WhatsApp. So, you better wash. Praise be to God. Amen. Where we are right now, the devil has no right because we are having [Music] delegates. Amen. And God is speaking to us right now. He's giving assignment. He's something to accept. He's imunizing the sick. He's setting the captive free. You can already believe. I'm here just to remind you of this in your mind. Jesus all your sin is no longer stressing us. Amen. Amen. Are you battling with sin? Are you troubled by demons? I'm here to tell you I have a prescription for you. Amen. Amen. Amen. I have a prescription this morning. Jesus was on us. He was still he was he was carrying the test. Praise be to God. Amen. He was in his lab. He was carrying different test in the lab. How does hunger come? Really, you can get hungry. Praise be to God. Until one day, the devil saw Jesus was hungry. You know, hungry man cannot hide. Even if he use a bucket of Vaseline, you will look pale. Even when he's talking, it's like the breath is coming from the legs. God bless you. Brother, are you sick? I'll be fine. So the devil knew that. He came to Jesus. Say if you're the son of God, turn the stone into bread. You see that is the same mistake that ever even is doing today. The devil has no mandate to tell you if you are son of God. You mean you don't know your father. Brother Julius, you know your dad. It's like going and tell Joseph my son that if you are the son of your dad, you go and ask him for for ice cream. He will not even come and I say, "Daddy, daddy, I want ice cream. ice cream. Okay, let's go. Let's But because the devil is a doubter from the beginning, every time he come with if if he's not sure our God predestinated us before the foundation of the world, he tried all the test. He tried each and everything. before the foundation of the world. But the devil's stuff is not tried at all. Is a quack professor. Even simple formula is not sure. When you tell him 1 plus one, this can't be two. are mature enough to ask me that. Okay, let me just put 2211. Praise be to God. But when faith comes to my brother Julian and tells my brother here one, he will stand by. That's why the Bible says this gospel is it looks like a foolishness to the world to them that perish. How can you tell them that they just come and lay hands on you and then cancer is gone, TB is gone, is gone. That cannot happen. Praise be to God. Even when that miracle happens, the devil will still overload his guys in his lap. It is impossible impossible. Praise be to God. But when God comes, Hallelujah. Amen. He told Jeremiah before you were forming your mother's womb, I knew you. I your prophets. Amen. Before we came on this world, God renew us. He knows how many steps you're going to take until the rapture. Not until the grave, until the rapture. Because this generation that has seen the Jews back their homeland, it will not pass away. Amen. Amen. Praise be to God. So when you are hungry, Jesus knows what hunger means. Yes sir. One time certain lady saw Jesus. They say blessed are the blessed are the breast which thou s. Then I tried to look around there where the sermon had anything to do with a breast. the same devil. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. Amen. So Jesus tells us he passed through all the test. He was tested with women with anger with strictness because he was totally human. He was 100% man and 100% God. Yes sir. That's why the devil cannot understand the logic. How can you become a saint? How can you be a child of God? How can Jesus be a God? And at the same time, 100% God, 100% man. How can you be saint? 100% sinner, 100% sane. He doesn't understand that. And thanks be to God, he will never understand that until rapture. Praise be to God. And when the rapture will take place, the devil will be surprised. I thought this brother was not going. He will look for you. He will not find you anywhere because the grace of God for you. Hallelujah. Amen. He predestinated us before. He made the conclusion from the end. God already made a conclusion. the name of the Lord. So this resurrection is restore us back to what we were before birth. Amen. Praise be to God. That's why the Bible say those who have believed in him. He has given you power to become sons and daughters of God. Amen. And when you read these things, you realize it's us who are letting the devil plays with your feelings. One time I preached a sermon here. And I told you that Christian, we don't rely on our feelings. Amen. No sir. Amen. But we lie on faith. As long as faith is there, the anchor hold and that ship cannot move. The ship is battered. Faith holds on the word. Amen. Amen. Yes sir. Without faith is impossible to believe. Praise God. That's why even get me the get me the saintest person here. Let him start to to confess. I'm a sinner. I'm a thief. I'm a fornicator. I'm a robber. A week will not end. You find him in prison because that's what you are confessing. But let us confess positive. Amen. We are eag. And in the eyes of the storm, that's why the eagle pass through that storm. There's calmness behind the storm. Yes, sir. Don't allow the devil to play with your feelings. We are fighting with the devil every day. Brother been fighting him for I don't know for how many years now? 40 years is fighting the devil. The devil is not ready to give up. Amen. Know your opponent. Know how he operates. Know how he works. Be aware of his of his leaks. Yes, sir. Jesus showed us the devil's. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. Amen. And that's why he came from the grave. He came out of the grave. And he not just stopped there. It was never for him to go there. And when he went there in the corridors of hell before those chain saints say that maybe saw him say this is the one who visited us. He's the one who gave us the promise. Blessed be the name of the Lord. and say may be also saw him. This is the ash of days. The one I saw in the wills of the wind. Praise be to God. The Bible say when we see him shall know him. Amen. Yes. Have you ever seen Jesus? No. I have seen his children. Yes. Praise be to God. When we look at their character, the way they love one another, the way they love God, the way they share one another, the way they are in the world, the way they live with one another, they associate when Jesus will appear. You will look at that from Jesus and you will know. Pastor to tell you Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen. Because you already have a portion of Jesus in you. That magnet, the small magnet in your soul, the seed of God in your soul, chaos in your soul. When the bigger one will come. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Yes sir. This magnet is a special one. Is a spiritual magnet because when will appear the dead in Christ will rise. Hallelujah. Amen. Talk about those graves with Amen. My God. My God. They dig there. They will dig the the soil. After digging, they put your coffin there. They put Amen. They put Have you seen where they burning someone? They even put iron sheet. Then they bring water. way back to there. Praise be to God. And if I was a Catholic and I paid for for my and my people pay for my purgatory, I would come and strike back. Look at how you treating me. And yet you even bribe the priest. That's being unfair. Please, my people have bribed the what? They have paid the money. Treat this body with care. At least bury me with money, some nice mattress, some fumes. Put a glass. Put some nice light. say that when Jesus comes it will not take it not be hard for him he will also look at the way the things praise be to God but that God when he comes after putting the cement others they put amen but when the trouble of God. The Bible tells us the very Christ shall rise. Amen. Oh, hallelujah. Grace will be bursting like popcorns. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Yes, sir. That same earthquake which took place where Jesus gave up the ghost. That same earthquake will again thunder when Jesus comes one day the children of Israel told him they called Moses we want to see that God of you going there to talk to him this time around. We want to see that God. And Moses told them, "Prepare yourself." Oh yes. If you want to see him, he's going to come. Amen. I mean, they were there busy, rejoicing, waiting, God is coming. Hallelujah. Glory be to God. Today we are going to see that he has noted us what he did for us. How dare him before the red sea? What if the water had failed to separate? So let him come. He's going to explain. And again when we ask for quails, he gave us a lot and even wanted us maybe to commit sin. They were there waiting. Amen. When they are still waiting, they are thundering flashing. And maybe to Moses, what is going on? As you wanted to talk to him, let him go back. We no longer want. Praise be to God. When God comes in our life, there's still nothing that can hold us. Yes. Yes. Sometime we sing my chains are gone and yet we allow oursel to be in shame. My chains are gone. And some deacons sometimes even want maybe to give you water and even the song leader will wonder. Brother, I have a project in Buuku. The other day that friend of mine is raring Fian [Music] cows and they're in the house that day on Friday. So they wanted to slash outside the gate. They have some bigger land outside the gate and they said before we bring the slasher man this animal to go and feed on the fresh ground. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. Amen. That day I saw what freedom means. My good Lord. Amen. These are not [Music] calant cows. The moment they open the gate within the coat just the they remove those stick which she amen. The thing jumped. I nearly say that some assaulted like 100 times. It jumped and ran going to knock the wall. Two double kick and more brother. I saw revival. Praise be to God.

There is something about liberty. If your animal can recognize their liberty, oh God, when I looked at that, I remembered way back when I was still in sin. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And when Jesus came to me, I realized I did not express enough joy. And what I did, I start I joined the party. I said, Hallelujah. Glory to God. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. And then my friends, what's going on? I told them I I feel like preaching you are someone here. Hallelujah. I was charged. And when they opened those animals and they went outside the gate, my brother, 30 minutes of revival, praising and worshiping, dancing and singing, Praise be to God. Amen. Amen. When God sets you free, that is not enough. Amen. Amen. Because you have been in shame. For a long time, for many years, for many months. Hallelujah. Amen.

There is something which that eyes have not is what your ears have not seen. That is what God is preparing. Hallelujah. Glory be to God. That is what God is preparing for us.

We never cut it like it is say that if not bear you cut in a throat in the fire. Jack fruit had to bear fruit. The next season fruits were there. Who did that? The master of the nature.

I already gave you the example if I not give it to you. Jesus gave us authority and his resurrection was a proof that our guy is now binding. Amen. Praise be to God. You need to be free. Walk like a free man. Every time you walk, you will never find me walking like no. Walk like a soldier because I'm a soldier. A soldier of the cross. Jesus sets me free. He gave my liberty. My freedom. The devil has no right. Stumble with my freedom. I am free man. Yes sir. One day I was preaching somewhere on the roadside and a certain guy came threatening because I told the police when I engage another gear I said even the government of Uganda cannot arrest me at this moment. Yes. There's whether you under anointing they have to wait for you. Let me tell you never dare to touch exop pipe when the motorbike is running. Even when they have just stopped will burn you. Praise be to God. No one can dare touch the exop. Amen. Amen. The minister is preaching. The anointing is boiling and then your car you come shouting shouting abusing and abusing. When I fall, when I I felt it was summer, it was too much. I made a prayer and say, "Oh God of heaven, have merc upon this guy's family. Do not put this upon them. I also pray for them. Forgive them." When I was still in the middle of prayer, I felt some cold thing touching my hand. That same guy was convicted. and bought a bott of water. He was he was saying like Simon the sorcerer. When he saw Peter preaching, the Holy Ghost falling anointing upon people, he was a sorcerer, he came and he also pretended to be saved. Ah, no. When he saw Philip in Samaria, Philip was my fellow deacon. Praise be to God. And I thank God that um yeah I'm not very far from Philip. He was a preacher that so when Philip preached and people were unan signs and wonders performed this man used to to life with with witchcraft. He came and repented and then he got saved but he did not he never departed or deviated from his what? I said you know you follow you must have something just back up even computers have back up. So he resolved this witchcraft in his back. When Philip preached they had to call she apostle the one Jesus gave the king. who got the revelation. He came and performed more and then this man came. Oh my brother Peter, God bless you. I'm also the same when we used to go. I'm now set free. Are you sure brother? Hallelujah. Amen. Then maybe Peter say was jumping. Glory to God. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Yes. Yes. I believe I receive glory. Hallelujah. I feel it. I think there they had already dealt with an Safia. That's right. Peter had tested that spirit before. Sister Safia maybe she came around 11 there. You know when sisters delays they come around 11. 11 there find out with the baby at the back in the back and sometime they also know that they late see her where he's facing this side let me go the other side I pass behind the flowers I come as if I was dropping So sister came remember they had sold a plot. Yeah. Cash was there. She had bought uh new shoes maybe and a nice bag. She had worked on herself. I know when she said everybody has to know that because if you look at the spirit they had it was not a good spirit. So maybe she bought tinkling shoes and that day brother had sat in she's spiritual even because by the way sometime when money comes become more spiritual. Yes Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God bless you, saints. I have a special song. There is a roof up above us. Have a good place. You stay. Can you remind me that song? Remind me that song. My brother and fridge was packed. That woman was prepared earlier. I need to ask our sister, you used to come early. Those days I used to come early. I could pray. But now I'm just thanking God, sister, why have you come late? You know what? You know, as you people say, we are selling our properties. We share it equally. So we have the reason why I have come late money was too much. We counted money after 4 hours. So I just play for 2 hours. I have to pray for my husband and brother was a very nice suit like this one of mine. Isn't it a nice suit? Praise be to God. Now she did not know. She thought the brother had gone for a short call. It was they had even they were even done with no the body. Ah, there's no wasting that money. We want money for the ministry. Sister, is this the only thing you [Music] pastor? You know, God does God always give you two to three some good number of chances. My sister. Yes, [Music] brother. Brotherh. She didn't know that was her death. She died at the pulpit. Hallelujah. Amen. So the man was standointed and he told him, "Suffer, you have not lied to me. You have lied the Holy Ghost. The bare feet which has taken your husband where the strong young men's the brother, the brother, where is my brother? My brother counled there and You will never read anywhere that they went to CPS and shifters of military intelligence came for investigation. Even the government feared. Remember the story of Elijah. Amen. I sent him 50. He told them, "If I'm a man of God, let fire come and consume you." And they were consumed. And then the last one cried for his life. Praise be to God. Peter had dealt with this spirit before. So when he saw the same in Simeon, he was not moved after jumping. Hallelujah. And everything like that. Praise be to God. So this man told him, so after he started praying for them and receiving the Holy Ghost, they received the Holy Ghost. So he came with the money, he said, my brother, you also give me this power that when I I will be able to impart anointing upon you. Oh, he pressed the wrong button. Peter told him, "You have no part things of God. You are very perish with your money. Please let those things have not fall." Praise be to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Jesus gave us what no one else will ever give. He has blessed us so high in heavenly places. That's where men fed with angels. Heavenly places in Christ. We are in Christ Jesus. That is where you are seated. No matter what you are going through, you in Christ Jesus. You are in his palms. He cannot lose you. It is just for a season. But your time is coming, read your Bible, see men of old, prophets of old, men of God, what they went through, but in the right time. One day Goliath roared in the wrong season revival had taken place in the camp of Amen. Something had happened. So he thought as usual that is how the devil operates. Don't become the devil's usual business. Mind you, the devil is weak when it's not in the body. You'll never be there. Then you hear a voice from the air saying do this. No, you first give him room in your heart. And the devil is very good in playing with your feelings. In the message demonology, the prophet say that when you prayed for for the first is it 48 hours that situation will be multiplied. I don't know how many times if you had just a minor headache, it will become terrible headache. If the eyes want to come out, the teeth are paining. If you ever had a tooth ache, there's when when you when a teeth will pain and will go crazy. One man told that he went to the dentist remove a tooth. And when they ask him because every every teeth they hit, he said, "Remove that one. Remove that one. Remove that one." And then the doctor said, "Now," he said, "Now remove everything." He felt all the teeth were paining. I've ever had that pain. I thought I was running mad. Blessed be the name of God. But the prophet says after 40 48 hours when you keep believing keep confessing I am healed. I am healed. I am fine. Hallelujah. I'm okay. Praise be to God. Finally the devil will go. The devil will go. Not until you denounce the devil, I will never be a breeding ground for the devil. Amen. If I was to be the devil's spice, spices in the devil's food. I would be sulfuric acid. Praise be to God. Don't give the devil ground. Brother, sister, look at Jesus carrying the sins of the world on his shoulder. He's struggling. He's going with a cross. woman of sin has come. He's opening. He was beaten. Hallelujah. He was tortured. He was mocked. Yet he knew no sin. Because he wanted to have liberty, to be free, to be anything. Nobody could pay our price. Sin was so cruel. In the message that on Calvary, the prophec fell, it was like a black sheet covering the earth and the earth was paralyzed. Because of sin, trees developed thorns because of sin. B started eating each other because of sin. Animal became prayerful to one another. We also became a prey because of sin. That is the cruality of sin. Oh, in the message of sin and what it take to ride sin out of our life. He said our sin was so cruel. It had to take God himself to come and carry our sin. And here he comes paid for everything. I just tell you to believe and say it is impossible. God will never come to our understanding. We have to understand God. Praise be to God. God has a standard. He has a principle which every Christian must follow. Your mother will never give you that. Your father will never give you that. Your grandpappa will know. It's only God. And where is the principle? Whosoever comes to God must believe. Brother, you must believe. Sister, you must believe. But frustration is not greater than our God. our faith. Amen. The moment you limit God to your problem, you limit him, he will get angry with you. Praise be to God. He takes the glory alone. He does not share with you anything. Not even your husband, not even your wife, not even your children, not even your bishop, not even not even soal overseers. God takes the glory alone. One day there is a man who spoke in the Bible and people shouted and said, "He has spoken like God. Before he finished the statement, the angel of the Lord strike him and he wrote, he started rotting from there. He was a king. Another time the king went to the altar to burn the incense and the prophet warned him and when he wanted to slap the prophet the hand got stuck. That is the God we talking about. One day the ark of the covenant was taken out from Israel. The priest and took it and they brought their soal get dagen. They placed it before the ar of the covenant. In the morning the guy was bowing down his stubborn stubborn servants. They brought him back. The following day the head was chopped off. Amen. Thanks be to God. But I have a God who will show off the head of every demon in your life. The head is when the head is not there. The body cannot work. When God show the head of Dagon, they gain some senses. Let us take this God back. Praise be to God. Are you stressed this morning? Are you troubled this morning? Your problem this morning? Let the ark of the covenant enter there. Is going to take away every situation is powing now. He has exalted his word above his name. There is nothing that can challenge the word of God. When I was young, I used to have a stomach trouble. It troubled me a lot. I went to everywhere and the problem was not there. But the the the pain was too was tense. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. Amen. But when Jesus found me, when I saw the light, Amen. that thing was still there. But as I was moving on, reading the Bible, I started exercising my faith. I forget my first Bible which I lost. I had read almost everything. Brethren, I just remembered maybe like I just remember like 10 years later that I used to have a very terrible traumatic I had a pimple. I don't know how they call it but that's thing. Do we have medical somebody? Brother Ivan. What? I had a what? Had a what? That's those are not the doctors. There were two here. That thing stay there for long. And I'm one person I hate seeing something on my body. I will battle with it. I could pierce it, pull it and the thing would come back. I bleed endure the pain. But when Jesus came, not even a trace. But brother Martin, that is something small. Our God does not use a fist to cast the devil. If he just does that, the devil can fall in. Hallelujah. God has no energy to waste to the devil. But believers if they allow to accommodate him Jesus leaves you until you get tired. You know the guy of Gada. That was his day. Praise be to God. I'm finishing brethren. That was his day. They saw Jesus from very fast. What have you come to do with us? Before our time, Jesus told the devil to keep his peace because they know that they are weak. They asked Jesus, "Have mercy on us. Let us go and occupy the [Music] pace." Those were those pigs. They had some common sense. They said to to hell with the devil. We rather go choke. If it means just imagine those businessmen the losses they made. But to God it was again because her soul was saved. If you save your soul will cause God to destroy all your enemies, he will do it. Our prophet tells us that soul is worth a thousand words. Just imagine that's why say no performed against each other. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm finishing with this quote in the message uh it's the rising of the sun 650418 65 in him we became part of him the Easter reveal they reveal sacred of God like it was then. Amen. Of life after death. That's when this secret was revealed. We are now alive. We were once dead in sins and trespasses. The true Easter Seal has broke from around me. True Easter Seal has broke death from around Hallelujah. That's why you find believer walking at night. Maybe the night dancer is following [Music] me. You feel some moving you run. Jesus takes away that fear. Fear creates what's not there. One minister one day was preaching and and he told us of a brother who feared electricity so much he knew electricity one day I'm not remembering it very well but it's like either the power was awful for some several days. So the brother came and grabbed that accidentally. I don't remember whether he even fainted but the power was not there but fear shocked the brother to death. Almost the heart was getting out. Don't fear. [Music] Don't fear. You see this witch, this uh witch doctors or sorcerers who come and preach you with a with a chicken head. They sprinkle some blood there with maybe some feathers of what? I always say, I wish they could leave their whole coke and you make a nice meal. rather than you've slaughtered a sheep. You have wasted it and you've come to waste also. Brother God, we don't we don't expect sister to call us. God bless you brother. Today in the morning I found the heart of a snake and a tail of lizard. They had mixed it in Vaseline. I even fear to open my shop. Sister, let me give you a prescription. Get a cane, a good one. Don't even waste your paraffin. Just give it in the name of Jesus. Kick it away. Open your business. And a few days down the road, someone will come and they come. Where do you walk now? For me, every Wednesday I go to church. That's not what I'm talking about. The other time I saw you kicking something here and there people said they were waiting for something whom I just know is the very person. That is the God we serve. The champion of the champion, the great warrior. Amen. He has fought our battles. We are walking above demon. Yes sir. We fear no evil. Shall we rise on our feet? We fear no evil. Jesus is risen from the dead. Praise be to God. I told you when the devil is to overcome you. He has to come. He has to come to church. Sit here. Hear the word. Ask the preacher. What shall we do? the preacher to command him. The devil repent beaptized in the name of Jesus Christ. But will the devil even believe to begin with the seed is not even there? That is too hard. How can I drop my tinkling [Music] shoes 21st century? Janet is not your role model. No sir is the fountain of honor. Janet is the fountain of honor's wife. Mr. He is the president. [Music] This is true. Sweetheart, Jesus is our role model. Yes, right now the tomb is empty. He never said us to vis. [Music] Catholics are keeping them because they are used every Sunday. I don't know what who has bewitched them. How come the nails are [Music] 13? When Jesus was going to heaven, he never told them to keep the nail. He never told brother Peter, "Therefore go into the well, photocopy the mail and give them the rosaries. [Music] He also believe and baptized shall be saved and this shall follow them that believe in my name. You shall cast out demon not in Mary's name. Mary never told them to cast demon in his name. She's our sister. For them, they are mother. Mary knows her children. James and others. Those are Mary's children and Joseph is their father. But we are the sons of God. Amen. Amen. We are the children of God and Mary is our sister because she's a daughter of God. She believed the word and the word became a womb in her and that word was Jesus. Praise be to God. I just wonder what do Catholics think when Mary was struggling on the day of she was filled with the Holy [Music] Ghost. May God have mercy. We praise the Lord. We thank God for the light he has given and we are glad to know that he is living. We walk with him every day. He's the one leading our path, guiding us every single day. And as long as the word is guiding us, we shall not stumble. We shall not fail. That is the true resurrection. Blessed be the name of the Lord. The Easter Seal at the beginning broke the seal of Roman seals. the Easter seal that was sealed up and men when they died was gone. But he broke the seal and revealed the secret. And now by the Holy Ghost has broke the seal from around our lives. And Christ is revealed as he lives in me. For now we are quickened with him. Hallelujah. Christ is now living. And if it's not there yet, this is your time. God bless [Applause] [Music] you. Oh, I will serve him because I love him. He has given life to me. Oh, I was nothing until he found me. He has given life to you. Join me and sing together. I will. You deserve it this morning this afternoon. brother. Glorious kid me life to me and I was we were nothing [Music] for life. Oh I will love him. Hallelujah. [Music] Oh yes, he has gi life to me. Oh, I was nothing. We were nothing. [Music] Oh, even Oh, I will trust him. I will trust him because he loves me. [Music] Yes.

Oh, I will believe because that God to me. I was I was [Music] nothing. [Music] Hallelujah. Just go before the Lord and speak to him. I want to tell that Jesus paid it all. He rose from the dead for yourself. You are the perfect will of God. That is the purpose why Jesus came. He came to set the captive free. He came to heal the brokenhearted. He came to give sight to the blind. With his twice we are healed. Precious father in the name of Jesus. Father we thank you for this moment. Oh God we are here before thy throne of grace.
