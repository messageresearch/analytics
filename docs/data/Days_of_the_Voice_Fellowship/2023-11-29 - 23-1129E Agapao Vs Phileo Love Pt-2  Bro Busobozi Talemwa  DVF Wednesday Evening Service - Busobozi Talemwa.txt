tonight amen Our Redeemer is wonderful isn't it wonderful amen it's been wonderful to us amen just want to turn to the scriptures now I greet you all in the name of Jesus uh this past Sunday we were visiting at inil Ministries in ginger minri with James and Ste and we had a very wonderful time in the word thank you for praying for us I also saw that you had a wonderful time on Sunday here God visited all of us the Saints they have sent their greetings amen praise God so this evening um we are also the audio for uh the fellow they stream this on their Zoom so we send our regards to all the saints that are going to be listening to this their home tonight so we are continuing with the thought we shared on last Wednesday and I'm asking you to turn to the book of First Corinthians usually when we stream on the zoom we don't go more than one hour so I just trust that uh today we'll be able to conclude this thought on agap and vers so we read 1 Corinthians chapter 13 we'll just go back to that amen so I'll read in English because of time from verse one though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and I have not charity I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though I have the gifts of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and and though I have all Faith so that I I could remove mountains and have not love love is Charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profits me nothing love suffereth long and is kind love envieth not love vth not itself and is not P does not behave itself unsing unseemly seeketh not our own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things and doth all things Love Never Fails but whether there be prophecies they shall fail where there be tongues they shall seize whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away i' would like the brother to read from Verses 4 to vers [Music] 8 praise God Amen you may be seated let's pray father Lord we ask that you'll come come and make yourself known to US Open this word to us Lord anoint us we are nothing without you lord we just need you to come overwhelm Us by the Revelation and inspiration of your word which will be a blessing to your people today different needs Lord in the fellowship the believer that are streaming on Zoom others that will hear this may you meet each need I pray I just take myself out of the way now said you will use me Lord as you will in Jesus name amen so this evening Saints we want to talk about AAP love now I understand that the word of the the word love is used many times and uh we really use it a lot but often times the word love has been misunderstood and he been only placed on feelings and imagine if you see something you say oh I love it what about if you could not see would you love it still well you say yeah I would love it because I would touch it so then then what about if you could not touch or you don't have the sense of feeling then how would you love it I would smell it smells nice I love it what about if you could not smell how well would you love it well you would say I hear the voice oh I love that sound how about if you could not hear so then you realize that love true love is not bound to the five senses true love is well over and Beyond the five senses and many times people when they talk about love they talk about it in connection to the five [Music] senses you know and that's where usually the problem comes from then we we devalue love and not able to truly understand the true meaning of love and yet we need love to be a part of our Lives to be able to be really really genuine without love we cannot be genuine in marriage you need love family you need love in the community you need love in the school in associations of your life we need love but as we saw in the first service and I'm not going to repeat it if you missed it please go and and and listen to it we were able to talk extensively about F love and we found that many of these things that is really F love many people think it is the real love but yet here we see in the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 13 he explains and expounds what love is he explains it really in in terms and in in the language that we can be able to understand for instance it says love suffereth long love is kind love enth not love V not itself love is not pu up it does not behave itself UNS seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoices not in iniquity but re rejoices in the truth truth oh my that is a a very big thing right there love rejoices in the truth what is truth he says Thy word is truth his word is truth love beareth all things believeth all things hopes all things endureth all things love is really over and Beyond many many and then he says Love Never Fails tell your neighbor Love Never Fails many things will fail he says if there are big gifts gifts like for instance prophecies they shall fail Tong shall fail you know uh knowledge shall fail all these things shall vanish away but love cannot fail what is it that cannot fail so in other words here is's trying to say that love has no expired debt love does not expire and yet let me ask you a question what is the main thing in a marriage relationship is it not love amen love is the main thing but here it says love does not expire why then do we see divorce why do we see two people loving each other so crazy about each other and then after a while they want to separate and then friends two great friends after a while they want to separate because what they had was another form of love it was not the real genuine love and we found that that the two different kinds of Love human love and which is fow love and love which is the Divine love that's a higher love a bigger higher level and so we found that pH love will fail many times and you know we read a scripture in the book of Isaiah where he where the Lord asks whether a woman can forget a hering child or whether she can forget her child from her womb and that he would not have compassion over that child and then you know you may almost say no it is not possible mothers truly love their children but also many times mothers have forgotten and forsaken their [Music] children now the love of a mother to the child is human love but that love too fails and and the love a woman usually has with with a husband and ver Versa is fellow love and that to fails the love between people who like each other and make confidence with one another even between countries between nations between people you know this all fail they have an expired de it is best under circumstances we found out also that the love that Jesus had rather Peter had for Jesus it seemed to be a real huge big love but that to failed it reached a place where it expired Peter even spoke to Jesus and said when all others forsake you I will never forsake you I will be by your side I will follow you until death but before death could come Peter had already forsaken Jesus and then you would still really know that Peter had love and Peter was genuinely in love with Jesus but he was genuinely in love humanly and that two fails and I also showed you that the Bible says that cast be a man that trusts in another and that our trust shall be in the Lord the problem of it is we trust in people and many times we say why did you disappoint me when I trusted you if you trusted man let me assure you that man will forsake [Music] you at one point that man will fail you because his love for you and vice versa has an expired day but there is a love that has no expiring that is divine love per love love that's the love of God the love of God can never expire the love of God made God put on flesh that he came down here on Earth To Die For Us who were nothing who gave him nothing who did nothing to attract his life everything we did pushed him away because he loved us he was willing to lay down his life so that we may attain life we who were dead in sins in our trespasses he loved us before he we knew him what a wonderful love we sing about such love such wondrous love that God should love a sin such as how wonderful a love like this so let me announce to you this evening God does not love you because you have done something to attract his love God loves you because he loves you and God knew you before you knew him God chose you in before the foundation of the world and you are manifested here and you believed him because you were attracted to his love not because you loved him so much that he decided to love you no you didn't even love him you were even running away like Adam and Eve were running away but because God loved them he came down and said Adam where are you in other words I'm here love see I am not going to let you die I am not going to let you fall away because I love you so much you are bound in my arms that's why he said all the father has given me will come they all inscribed in the palm of my hands none of them will be lost and I'm here because of his love you are here because of his love not because of your actions and you leave the bad actions because of his love praise the name of the Lord and so he found out that then love regresses regresses they find out that the perfect love is divine love which is the love of God and then from there we find another level which is called and we read that from the message he must be born again and then from there we find let me just read that portion for you because that's what we ended with after that comes from the love that you you have for your wife someone would insult her you will shoot his brains out because it creates a jealousy but that is that is secondary love then comes last for another man's wife you see now from a it regresses to regresses now to last you find someone saying I love you but to someone else's [Music] wife is that truly love that's not even pH love that is last praise God you're saying love I love you to a woman that you're never going to [Music] marry that is last and then after last then comes fil right then it just becomes perverted after [Music] that F perversion that's how the devil brings down and you know regresses love and then he says pH love would make you shoot a man for insulting your [Music] wife would make you pray for his L soul that is the difference so you must be born again now listen now when the Bible says husbands love your wives is that amen husbands love your wives what kind of love is he talking about husbands love your wife talking about last answer me is it talking about filth is it talking about perion is talking about love he is talking about what many times you want to say well well says a woman a man has for his wife love so then that means that between a marriage should be on the basis of if you understand it that way then you've not understood anything that is only the beginning love will make you attract get attracted to [Music] her but love will take you in another real which is a supernatural real whereby you do not see how she looks what she has what she has done what she has not done whereby you will go into another realm where it is Supernatural naturally Supernatural let's continue with the verse husbands love your wives even as Christ love the child Hallelujah when Christ love the child he did not love us with he us with and then he continues on even as Christ loved the church and he gave himself for it he was willing to die he was willing to sacrifice him he was Will to do everything and anything for the sake of the lover that he had now you might say well yeah a man can love a woman with that he will do anything and everything but you know what the moment that man finds that woman cheating he will not even think twice he will say enough is enough enough is enough we are going to have this no more why because the only connection that they have but if their connection is it never fails never fails when Jesus came down he found us flatting with sin he found us living Immortal he didn't say enough is enough but he said I love you still I want to save you I want to redeem you even now he's speaking to you no matter what kind of life you think you are no matter how bad you think you are he still says I love you I love you I still love you I love you I will love you I continue to love you because I love you I want to save you and that's why I died for you on the cross condition no condition absolutely no condition that God should seen such praise the name of the Lord and then we continue on with a few more moments I want us to now look at now 1 John 4:7 behold let us love one another for the for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God is that amen and know with God let us read it again let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that that love is born of God and let me ask you a question we've seen many people say I love you and they in prostitution they in filth they're in l can we really say that they are born of God also because they said I love you and they feel love feelings that's not the kind of love he's talking about he's talking about another kind of Love's talking every that Bor of God he's born again he's filled with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah if you have it means you filled with the Holy Ghost he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love tell your neighbor God is love God is love God is love and this is a seal that message Believers have loving one another loving one another hallelujah hallelujah you must love one another when you find someone with bitterness fting themselves proud you know you know wanting seeking for something you know for themselves you know when you it means that person has no Holy Spirit it means that person has no love you know when they do something to them they walk away from the church when something happens they will call you all sorts of names and then at first you thought they were Believers but now they remove their true colors let me tell you if you're a True Believer filled with the Holy Ghost you will have love to an extent if you are wrong you still have love for the people that have wronged you you will still pray for them you will still love them and you still want them to go to heaven but then you will find Believers when someone does something to them they will immediately send those people to hell that one will never go interrupt that one is not a believer that one is not whatever it shows that you are filled with bitterness and the love of God is not even in you it means you are also not going to heaven that if you have the love of God no matter what anyone does no matter what anyone says against you you will still love them you will still call them brother you will still call them sister and they would think you are a fool but you can't help it because you have the love of God in your soul you know no bitterness Hallelujah you don't know Revenge to a Son of God who is filled with the Holy Ghost we don't know any Revenge we know his love help me shout love all we know his love we should love one another I don't love that brother they did this and this to me I will never you don't have the Holy Spirit if you have the Holy Spirit you will forget what somebody did to you immediately as soon as they do it forgetting means forgiving in your in your mind you know they did it but you don't hold them against you forgive them and you love them any if you f it is impossible it means you don't have the holy spirit yet and you should ask God to fill you with the Holy Spirit when it fills you with the Holy Ghost you will soon realize it is possible in the message that the works that I do bear witness of me when God wants sign signs His Name Across something like that signs your name or the name of Christ and on a notary takes the seal and puts on [Music] there he the name and the seal that puts on there presses that thing down rather it is there to stay what I mean you know what I'm speaking of now listen usually when you write they write a letter and then it is signed then you can take it to the notary public they call them not public those people they are legal they the legal representative of the government prove that this letter and the the person who has signed is all authentic so they it with a seal and they put a seal from the not Republic now he's saying when Jesus Christ signs on a letter A SE is put that thing is there to stay now your life when it is signed by Jesus when he accepted by Jesus what does he do he puts a seal heises you that you are authentic Hallelujah Hallelujah by filling you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he says now I'm preaching it I'm not preaching iternal [Music] security that's not what I'm talking about I am it's just more easy thing to rub away from the Holy Ghost when God once seals that love into your [Music] heart when God seals that love your heart did you hear what I just read to you what does it seal you with fills you with lovees that in there the moment that comes in your heart is a b of perfection once you receive that seal of the Holy Ghost it is not easy to rra that thing away once it happens to you you are sealed until the day of the Rapture you can never go to hell you can never be this because you have the life of God in you don't you want it friends f with the power the baptism of the Holy Ghost you cannot rub it away sin cannot R it away your thoughts cannot R it the devil canot R it away it will remain there sealed until the day of your Redemption the thing becomes so dead the things of the world if you got the real genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit if you still have last for that last for money last for women last for pleasure last for the world last for you know Immortal things rather all you need is the baptism of the Holy the day you get it is the day of your Victory you will still be tempted but you have a power a power sealed with seal with Sealed With whereby the Devil cannot rub it away hallelujah hallelujah amen amen that is the power that overcomes the world and he said it is Love in Your Heart oh hallelujah hallelujah somebody shout hallelujah hallu and in the in the questions and answers 1964 there's a question here that was asked to brother Bram dear brother Bram do you believe that signs should follow all who have the Holy Spirit you know some people say well we don't need science we only need the word but listen to what our Prophet say Jesus said so Mark 16 hallelujah hallelujah he said if so the question goes what about the people who believe the message with all that is in them yet they have not the signs are they unbelievers or do they need the Holy Spirit if so please instruct us today how to receive the Holy Ghost we believe you are God's mouthpiece for our day and here is the answer say thank you my brother for regarding me as your brother and I think that that's a very good question friends yes it is a little slack I would like to deal a little bit longer on that if I could it is slack it is slack it is slack slack is like sleeping it's like sluggish it is like on that area Slack [Music] some of you when you cannot receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost without having an experience when it happens now if you believe every aspect of the word you say you believe every word every spec of it then the word is laying in there are you hearing me you believe all the word you believe every word so the word as long as you believe it is laying in there in your heart listen waai everybody say waiting for the ho Spirit to put it to work meaning if you don't have the Holy Spirit you are a dead believer you a believe of the word but dead in your life you how will you know you will not have love love is one of the fruits we will see it later how will you know because the fruits will not come out you will bear nothing you'll be unfruitful amen the the gifts will not manifest the fruit will be dry if the tree does not bear fruit and the tree does not you know have flowers no fruit no flowers only leaves showing it has it has life but it shows no further life of the real tree by bringing the fruits how is that tree that tree is baren that tree is dead and Jesus one time he found it and he cast it he said how can I not find the fruit he cast it no one will ever eat of you so he says if you believe the word the word is laying in there waiting for the Holy Spirit to put it to work amen but it takes the lighting of the candle it takes an experience amen isise God that life will be there of the word the word is a power the word is a seed but the seed cannot come to life without the water without the sun without an experience but wait when that seed re the sunlight and receives the water the seed will have a jubile amen the seed will have an experience the seed will begin to go to work in that seed is many other fruits in that seed is many other plants that seed will die until never come back up again until life comes on until water comes on until the power comes on and we have received the word you have believed the word but you need the Holy Ghost to come upon that word and watch Life begin to come you who has not able to sing a special song you eventually begin singing you who was coming late to church eventually be on fire for God you who could not run away from Immortal things you will eventually be dead to those Immortal you that was a liar your tongue cannot lie against because the seed the word in you is now going to work I'm continuing here it takes the lighting of the candle here is the candle with the weak in it and with the the T and everything it has to have that candle but until the fire comes on it will not shine any light somebody say Lord send a fire now hallelujah hallelujah until the fire comes on that week it will not shine any light are you following me now no matter how perfect the candle is and perfect it will burn and everything it has got to be written and then it burns and when you believe and are made up of the instructions of what the holy spirit is what is that Hallelujah love he says love he says what you made up the instruction for what the holy spirit is what is it what is the holy spirit love joy peace long suffering goodness the fruits that it Bears out until the holy spirit with a fe fiery experience comes [Music] down and lights that candle then you haven't received the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit must come down with an experience with a sluggish experience with a doing experience with a very silent experience right are you following with a whaty experience with the moment you receive that fire experience you cannot say I did not know that I received it you will know you will be like fire it will burn up in your soul bur up in your life you will be bubbling with joy you'll be bubbling with peace love you feel like you love everybody you feel like you so joyful like you so happy feel like you a millionaire because you received God in your soul oh God am let fill you with the power of the holy God you've got to have the experience to have the Holy Ghost that experience come to those that desire it amen you cannot have love without that experience what you have can be f or last but you can never have a power experience because love is the fruit of the spirit love is the fruit of the spirit Joy is a fruit long suffering is a fruit peace is the fruit whether you have money or not if you have the you have peace you have joy you have love joy and speak full of how do you know you have joy you'll be so happy when we are singing amen you will be so happy you feel a song coming from your soul amen when the word comes you you will receive it with so much joy Hallelujah but if you don't have it you'll be so dark so cold why so heavy because you are not you have not had the experience here friends get the experience get the experience and then you will know the love of God in the message a trumpet gives an uncertain sound praise God let me now via off you here amen any woman that's going to marry a man and she's not certain of that man she would better leave him alone and any man that's going to marry a woman and not certain you better leave her alone you'd better pray through on it until God gives you the answer until God gives you the answer and then when God joins together let no man put a what but we must first pray through on that who joins not the preacher who joins God joins now listen church he says he you must pray through if you're going to marry someone and you're not sure leave them alone pray through until God gives an answer why because God knows amen there is no trust and confidence in your that one will disappoint you did you know you cannot even trust yourself I can't even trust myself sometimes the things I think can do I surprise myself why because I'm a human being but listen when I receive that AG in my [Applause] soul then I begin to hear from God because I have the life of God in Me amen and God is leading me God is telling me what to do God is driving me so I will pray until I'm sure about anything and when I'm sure I would go and do it I remember when I was going to marry my wife I reached a place when I felt I wasn't sure I packed up my bags I packed up my bags and went to the village for a few days there praying and waiting for God to Spirit and God speak and confir it to me and I have an experience marriage should be an experience it shouldn't be something arranged marriage is not arranged by parents is not arranged by pastors marriage is not arranged by your feelings marriage is arranged by God and how do you know that she will deal with you and deal with her and it will all be lining towards one thing you bre through why do you pray because you can't trust your you can only trust in the of if we would stud what we are doing when we are going to get married when we choose our wife our husband if you would study it over a man should pray earnestly for he could ruin his entire life the reason why it is difficult for young people to find wives and husbands is because they're not filled with the Holy Spirit they don't have an experience with God they trying to find them oh she has beautiful eyes oh my God look at and then eventually no I'm not sure now what did she do I cannot I cannot I cannot if you if it is a and you find out they have HIV you can't turn [Music] away to them never fail when you Mar that person ifap that connected you you'll live together for forever until you die we won't even talk about divorce why AAP never fails [Music] why do young people fear to marry they say women are not easy men women are saying men are not easy because they all trusting in F never fails that's why a man must pray honestly but he should not even pray for a woman to marry or a man to marry before you receive the Holy Spirit find an experience with God [Music] first on the outer fast it's only and only then if you filled with the Holy Ghost that you can have before you get the Holy Spirit what you have is only and I can tell it will fail it's only a matter of time but love never fails praise God I'm continuing Remember The Vow is until death to and he could ruin his life by making the wrong choice but if he knows what he is making the wrong choice and he's Maring a woman that isn't fit to be his wife and he does it anyhow then it is his fault if the woman Tes a husband and knows that he is not fit to be a husband then you that's your own fault and after you know what is right and wrong so you shouldn't do it until you you've thoroughly pray through praise God praise God because of time I just continue down here now the St of a perfect man I might say something here The reason I believe now someone got me all wrong yeah not long ago I got a letter from a Ministry Association said that I believed that we were Soul mated and we must leave our companions if we are not Soul mated to to marry one another that we were Soul mated to I said I'm not guilty of a like that I've always been against that I don't believe in that that you are soul to someone no that's not true if there are people who are believing it here I want to tell you that's not true that it is you are compatible only to this one no that's not true he says certainly not I don't believe in that I believe that God gives us a med somebody tell somebody God gives us a hallelujah hallelujah God gives you a m like brother Andre God is giving you a m God give you sister f who is she she's from God she was just right close you to you and you didn't even know her but you remember I told you brother going prayer ask God and then guess what God gave you God gives you a man that's true and when we become part of each [Music] other and then we become part of each other after God brings her then you become part of each other but remember God gives you don't choose with your [Music] it's not it's if you choose someone [Music] using and that one cannot fail and before a man gets married you should think these things over and study it a young man asked me the other day he said you think I could ow to get married brother Bram to such and such a girl can I Mar sister this one I said how much do you think of her now this quot has been misrepresented many times I wanted to hear cler and I said how much do you think of her he said oh I just love her and I said well if you are not going to live without her you better Mar her then but if you can live without her you better not here is someone coming to a prophet of God he says look I love this [Music] person so you want me to tell you whether you should marry or not he says if you can't live without her then marry her there is something I want you to see do you know we can live with without anyone but we can't live without Jesus without God is onlyy to say if you then love Mar her but if it's just a feeling like I see you then you better not so but it's going to kill you you better you better go ahead and get married if he going to kill you the only thing that would kill me is if you take Jesus out of me but if you take anything and everything and give me Jesus then I will be alive and Jesus is that's a fruit that shows is in my soul was not saying you like you flying then marry her no we've seen them like that and then they Chang their mind even on the just before the of the wedding and others mared one year are no longer love but you you said you can't without I can what was wrong at first I did not see properly it was it was just feelings in your emotions but it wasn't a choice of God through and so what I was trying to get to him what brother bam is saying what I was trying to get to the younger man that if you love her so much he he was trying to tell is saying he was trying to bring to the young man to make him understand if you love her so much then but again I ask which love the love which does not fail now right now before you are married and everything is just fine and Dy you seeing her beauty you're seeing his his good looks and um then now but after you get married the toils of Life Tri that's when you've got to be so in love that you understand one another when you are disappointed in her she disappointed in you you still understand one another if you you are dis if you disappoint one another you still understand what is it it is not your natural love it's not human love it Tak love Beyond [Music] mistakes the Bible says love covers a multitude of [Music] sins amen praise God even when she does this he does this you understand that's the way it is with Christ we've got to be so in love with him till when we ask for something and he doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake us a Hallelujah don't love Jesus with ph love love him with his own love whether he loves you rather whether he doesn't give you what you want or whether you say whether oh If It Makes You Happy take me to hell I will love you whether it makes you happy to make me poor I will love you now that is love this kind of love of give me I give you see me I see you it fails soon whe whether it doesn't give it we still love him why and the only way you can do that the only way you can do that is to become [Music] partakers of his divine nature by receiving the Holy Ghost then you will understand the reason he canot give it to you take of his divine nature that is why for those that have this nature tells them ask whatever you want why because he knows you are not going to ask for you're not going to ask for fornication but he knows you going to ask for what is in him your nature is his your life is his life and you are him Colossians 3:14 as we finish and above all these things things put on love which is the bond of [Music] perfectness and let the peace of God rule in your to be which also you are called the which also you are called in one body and be you thankful now that's why he says under no circumstances believe I love her with what kind of I fear you what kind of love to the ex that you marry her God bless you may stand when you get these things you will realize many things are not as difficult as you think it [Music] is he in the New Testament he wants to do everything for you why do you just stand there and watch and think about his love can we sing think about his love think about his goodness let us pray loving Jesus
