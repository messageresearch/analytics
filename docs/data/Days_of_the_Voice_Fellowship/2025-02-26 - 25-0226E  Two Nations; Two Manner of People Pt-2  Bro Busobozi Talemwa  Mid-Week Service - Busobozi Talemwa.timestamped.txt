[40:02] away of the

[44:22] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[44:27] uh shall we turn to our
[44:35] Bibles um we will read again Genesis
[44:38] chapter
[44:45] 25 um so this evening I'm also speaking
[44:49] to evening light bright Tabernacle
[44:57] they streaming this on
[45:01] Zoom so um I want to greet the Saints at
[45:05] evening
[45:09] light uh so our service this service
[45:12] that I'm preaching on Zoom is also being
[45:15] preached to the Saints here at
[45:20] dvf and also those who will be listening
[45:23] to this on on YouTube
[45:27] so to to those of you who are here there
[45:29] are more here than than than a part of
[45:33] than I
[45:38] here so are we ready for the Lord to
[45:41] speak to
[45:43] us we are reading out of the Book of
[45:46] Genesis chapter
[45:49] 25 and uh we shall read the verses we
[45:52] read on Sunday this is supposed to be
[45:54] like part two of of the thought I
[45:57] ministered on on
[46:01] Sunday um so brother just asked me to
[46:04] minister to the
[46:08] Saints I thought it is fine it
[46:14] can yeah so let us begin from vers 21 to
[46:24] 24 if you there say Amen
[46:27] [Music]
[46:29] and Isaac entreated the Lord for his
[46:32] wife because she was Barren and the Lord
[46:34] was in intreated of him and Rebecca his
[46:38] wife conceived and the children
[46:40] struggled together within her and she
[46:42] said if it be so why am I thus and she
[46:45] went to inquire of the Lord and the Lord
[46:47] said unto her two nations are in thy
[46:49] womb and two man of people shall be
[46:51] separated from the Bo and the one of the
[46:54] people shall be stronger than the other
[46:56] people and Elder Shall Serve the
[46:58] younger and when her days to to be
[47:02] delivered were fulfilled behold there
[47:04] were twins in a womb and the
[47:07] first okay I think we just end
[47:25] it for
[48:06] amen you may be
[48:08] seated so usually when I'm speaking to
[48:11] the Saints on Zoom I take not more than
[48:14] one
[48:18] hour so uh this service is not going to
[48:22] be a long
[48:24] service how many are happy to be in the
[48:26] house of the
[48:29] Lord
[48:31] amen uh I don't know why you would want
[48:34] to sit behind the pillar
[48:42] when so two Nations two manner of
[48:47] people so we begin with this verse 21
[48:52] which says Isaac entreated the Lord for
[48:54] his wife because she was barren
[49:03] you know we have many examples in the
[49:05] Bible of women that were
[49:09] [Music]
[49:10] baren but all those women who were
[49:14] baren they eventually gave
[49:18] birth so I believe that if someone is
[49:23] baren it is because the Lord wants to
[49:26] manifest his
[49:29] glory but the Bible says ask and you
[49:32] shall
[49:33] receive so if you're listening to me and
[49:37] you are baren there have been instances
[49:40] where husbands intreated the Lord for
[49:43] their
[49:46] wives and there have also been times
[49:49] when the women themselves went before
[49:51] the
[49:54] Lord like we know of scario where Hannah
[49:57] went before the
[50:00] Lord she cried out to the Lord she said
[50:03] no Lord enough is enough I need a son
[50:07] and if you give me a son I'll give
[50:10] her and the lord gave him a son you
[50:13] remember how the prophet the man of God
[50:15] came and spoke to
[50:17] her and I say that whatsoever you you
[50:20] desire God has given to
[50:22] you and there have been another scenario
[50:25] of manoa's wife
[50:29] who did not also have a child who later
[50:32] on gave birth to
[50:34] Sam Hannah gave birth to
[50:36] Samuel the the prophet and manoah's wife
[50:40] gave birth to
[50:41] Samson a great man in
[50:44] Israel and now we we see many other
[50:47] examples also
[50:49] Elizabeth Elizabeth also gave birth to
[50:52] John remember elizabe Elizabeth was also
[50:55] baren
[50:58] Elizabeth was a wife of a priest
[51:02] even
[51:04] bar so and and then Elizabeth gave birth
[51:08] to
[51:10] John after the encounter with the angel
[51:13] of the
[51:15] Lord so you see women in the Bible who
[51:17] were
[51:19] baren it is because they were going to
[51:22] bring forth someone great into this life
[51:28] that's why you should always watch women
[51:29] who are
[51:31] Buren and they give birth
[51:34] later those children they give birth
[51:37] too are usually something in this
[51:41] life having a very big work to do in
[51:44] this
[51:45] life so if you're
[51:47] married and you are baren or it has been
[51:50] difficult for you to have a child over a
[51:52] period of years
[51:56] and you were a true child of
[51:58] God you're standing right with the word
[52:01] and you are listening to me right now I
[52:04] want you to just know it is because God
[52:07] has a great
[52:09] plan and if you know of someone who is
[52:12] in that
[52:13] condition tell them God has a great
[52:17] plan and so we find here there's another
[52:20] person who was
[52:22] bur and that is
[52:25] Rebecca Rebecca was the wife of
[52:29] Isaac and you remember how Isaac was
[52:31] able to get Rebecca as a
[52:36] wife it's a long story but you Bible
[52:39] readers know it how God spoke I mean how
[52:43] the the father of Isaac
[52:46] Abraham spoke to
[52:49] elzar and told him go among my
[52:52] people and among my
[52:54] Kindred and and find a wife for my
[52:58] son he told him touch my son he said
[53:02] swear that you will go among my
[53:05] people because the man was about to
[53:08] die so he said
[53:10] swear that in other words even if he's
[53:13] dead
[53:15] not will carry out the instructions he
[53:18] has been
[53:20] given said swear that you'll get a
[53:23] wife from my son among from among
[53:28] you know this is before the New
[53:31] Testament before the New Testament God
[53:34] has always desired that you marry from
[53:36] among your
[53:40] people and our people as Believers are
[53:45] believers God wants you brother to marry
[53:48] from among
[53:50] people and your people are
[53:53] believers your people are not Thea
[54:04] some people you you know they they like
[54:06] lifting up their
[54:08] tribes and some people think that their
[54:11] tribes sometimes or their tribes are
[54:13] superior to other
[54:17] tribes there there are no tribes among
[54:20] the Gentiles that are superior to other
[54:25] tribes we all
[54:28] PE we
[54:31] dos before God you remember what Jesus
[54:35] told that
[54:36] woman he said that how can I take the
[54:38] food of
[54:40] children and give it to dogs in this
[54:43] sense he was meaning the Jews are the
[54:45] children the
[54:47] Israelites and the Gentiles are the
[54:50] dogs you understand so in other words
[54:53] before God we are all the same
[54:56] and we were all
[54:58] rejected but by grace and by for
[55:02] knowledge he predestinated us unto
[55:06] Sons so we are children of God we are no
[55:10] longer dogs we are children can you say
[55:14] I'm a child of
[55:16] God and so among us we have different
[55:19] tribes and different you know tribes
[55:21] around the world and around even in this
[55:22] country
[55:27] humble
[55:28] yourself there is not tribe speedier
[55:31] than another
[55:33] one and and in every culture of of all
[55:37] these
[55:39] tribes there are real
[55:43] issues that Believers need to be
[55:45] delivered out
[55:47] of and if you very careful you look at
[55:50] each
[55:51] tribe and when I look at you here I see
[55:54] several tribes
[55:56] Naturally Speaking if you look
[55:59] carefully you had people saying that oh
[56:02] this tribe they are good adulterers oh
[56:05] this tribe they are
[56:06] good witches oh this tribe they are this
[56:09] or that tribe they are
[56:18] this if you look at what they
[56:21] saying
[56:23] is really true because they say those
[56:28] words after many
[56:31] years of
[56:33] observing and and you will
[56:36] find that this tribe they're very good
[56:38] with with
[56:41] bewitching this Tri they very good with
[56:44] with
[56:46] adulter others
[56:48] are others you understand and and if I
[56:52] mentioned these
[56:54] Tripes some of you will be offended at
[56:57] you but that's the reality it is the
[57:01] truth if you look at it in the natural
[57:04] sense that is why as children of God we
[57:09] are delivered from being a part of those
[57:14] tribes we should never have those kind
[57:16] of tribal sentiments Among
[57:21] Us when it comes to
[57:23] marriage you as a believer number one
[57:28] priority is first to seek a brother or a
[57:32] sister that is Holy
[57:36] Feld that has the
[57:39] birth that is chain that is a citizen of
[57:43] another
[57:45] country that is filled with the Holy
[57:48] Ghost that is exactly like you
[57:51] are but if you don't do that you are
[57:54] risking your entire life with someone
[57:57] who is from one of the
[58:02] tribes and that is very
[58:04] dangerous so so you know this man told I
[58:08] think it was Abraham Abraham
[58:11] told go from among my
[58:15] people and find a bride for
[58:18] myself my people our people are the
[58:23] Believers the Believers of the world not
[58:26] just the Believers because we have many
[58:29] intellectual
[58:32] Believers the Believers that are filled
[58:34] with the Holy
[58:35] Ghost the Believers that have the birth
[58:39] right those are the manner of
[58:42] people Believers should Mar for can I
[58:46] hear on
[58:48] that now SOA went and he found a
[58:53] wife you know the story on how he found
[58:56] her and her name is
[58:59] Rebecca so now Rebecca came you know
[59:02] they asked her whether she wanted to go
[59:04] she said yes I wanted to
[59:07] go and she came and met
[59:11] Isaac in the
[59:13] field not at home but in the
[59:17] field
[59:18] Midway and the Bible talks about us
[59:22] meeting Christ in the air
[59:27] oh my so the marriage of
[59:30] Isaac and Rebecca is also a type of the
[59:33] marriage of Christ and his
[59:37] church we are going to meet Christ not
[59:39] in
[59:40] heaven not on us we are meeting
[59:45] him we are meeting him in the
[59:47] air the Saints of all
[59:50] ages the Bible says they shall
[59:53] resurrect amen and then we who are
[59:56] remaining and
[59:57] alive I don't know whether you are going
[59:59] to die but for me I will be alive and
[1:00:04] remain I believe I actually believe the
[1:00:08] Rapture will find
[1:00:09] me I'm not preparing to die anytime
[1:00:13] soon then I and you who are alive and
[1:00:17] remain shall be changed in a moment in
[1:00:20] the tling of an eye and the Bible says
[1:00:24] we shall meet the Lord in the air
[1:00:26] how we will go in the air I don't know
[1:00:29] but the Bible says we shall meet him in
[1:00:31] the
[1:00:32] air and then we will go with him and
[1:00:36] ever be with the
[1:00:37] Lord so that is a type here of the
[1:00:41] marriage between Isaac and
[1:00:43] Rebecca so Rebecca is the type of a
[1:00:47] bride and Isaac is the type of the
[1:00:51] Bride praise the Lord so rebecc is the
[1:00:55] type of the church
[1:00:57] see I'm trying to progress something to
[1:00:59] you
[1:01:00] here then we see that
[1:01:03] Isaac had a wife but his wife was
[1:01:09] Buren his wife did not have a
[1:01:13] child and Isaac went before the Lord and
[1:01:17] prayed he said my wife is
[1:01:20] B he intreated I don't not know which
[1:01:23] words he used
[1:01:26] but he must have talked to the Lord
[1:01:29] about it if you have a matter disturbing
[1:01:33] you if you are the manner of people that
[1:01:35] is on the side of
[1:01:37] God you can always talk to to God
[1:01:41] about talk to God about it God answers
[1:01:45] prayer tell your neighbor God answers
[1:01:49] prayer
[1:01:50] Rebecca the Bible says his wife
[1:01:54] conceived and the children struggle
[1:01:56] together within
[1:01:59] her that's now where we are going to get
[1:02:02] into
[1:02:04] our praise the name of the
[1:02:08] Lord excuse me now see it says that the
[1:02:12] children
[1:02:15] fought and they struggled together
[1:02:17] within
[1:02:18] her and she said if it be
[1:02:21] so why am I
[1:02:24] thus and she went to also inquire of the
[1:02:30] Lord glory to God I'm excited because
[1:02:33] I'm seeing many things
[1:02:35] here I'm reading about Rebecca but I'm
[1:02:38] seeing the Church of
[1:02:40] Jesus I'm also seeing myself as an
[1:02:44] individual you know Rebecca was a Church
[1:02:46] of
[1:02:47] Christ but in wom was two
[1:02:51] children and these children were
[1:02:53] fighting and and she Al went to inquire
[1:02:57] over and the Lord said unto her two
[1:02:59] nations are in
[1:03:01] th two of people shall be separated from
[1:03:04] th
[1:03:06] B and the one people shall be stronger
[1:03:09] than the
[1:03:10] other and the Shall Serve the
[1:03:13] younger and when our days came to be
[1:03:15] delivered were
[1:03:18] fulfilled there were twins in our
[1:03:21] wom and on Sunday I talked about twins
[1:03:25] and I said this was just a personal
[1:03:28] opinion I said I would never desire to
[1:03:31] deliver
[1:03:33] twin why because you every time you find
[1:03:37] twins in the
[1:03:39] Bible well there is a problem with one
[1:03:41] of the
[1:03:43] twins you look at Kan and Abel there was
[1:03:46] a problem with
[1:03:48] Kan you look at now es and
[1:03:52] Jacob had a problem you look at every
[1:03:56] time they are
[1:03:57] twins there is
[1:03:59] issues but we notice here that when she
[1:04:03] had twins in our
[1:04:05] wom and and I maybe read this again to
[1:04:09] give the pr especially for
[1:04:11] the now remember each church has its
[1:04:14] formal and each church has its
[1:04:19] spirituals that's the twins that's born
[1:04:21] in every Revival and lives and sorry and
[1:04:23] lives in every church right
[1:04:29] they started right in this
[1:04:33] age talking about the Ephesian
[1:04:36] Church see that former
[1:04:39] religion there is no difference between
[1:04:41] that and
[1:04:43] Catholicism it's all the same thing
[1:04:46] every organization is butchered right
[1:04:48] into
[1:04:49] it and God never did organize his church
[1:04:55] that is exactly what they was trying to
[1:04:57] do
[1:04:58] here and you watch and see now if that's
[1:05:01] isn't
[1:05:02] right it just shows you how cast an
[1:05:05] organization
[1:05:08] is it was foreign to the new
[1:05:11] church so brother here is talking about
[1:05:14] every
[1:05:17] Revival on Earth every
[1:05:20] Revival has had
[1:05:22] twins and these twins here is a True
[1:05:25] Vine and
[1:05:28] the true church and the false
[1:05:29] Church in the beginning of the church
[1:05:32] the first church
[1:05:34] AG when by the way when you see in the
[1:05:37] Book of
[1:05:39] Revelation every time he speaks to the
[1:05:43] church I'll just give you a little
[1:05:45] example
[1:05:47] here in the Book of
[1:05:49] Revelation
[1:05:51] chapter two chapter chapter two yes
[1:05:56] and vers one it says under the Ang of
[1:05:57] the Church of
[1:06:00] Ephesus these things there's something I
[1:06:03] want to show you here these things say
[1:06:05] he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his
[1:06:07] right
[1:06:09] hand who WTH in the midst of the seven
[1:06:11] golden
[1:06:13] cand I Know Thy works and thy
[1:06:16] labor and th patience and how can and
[1:06:19] how thou canot cannot bear them which
[1:06:21] are
[1:06:24] evil and thou tried them which say that
[1:06:26] they are
[1:06:28] Apostles and are not but you have found
[1:06:32] them
[1:06:33] Liars so this is the very first the
[1:06:36] beginning of the gentle
[1:06:39] church but right at the
[1:06:41] beginning there was the false Vine and
[1:06:44] the True
[1:06:46] Vine in the framework of the Christian
[1:06:51] church we are not talking about Muslims
[1:06:54] and and and and and and
[1:06:58] Christians and
[1:07:00] Christians are talking about the
[1:07:02] Christian
[1:07:05] church the church has a
[1:07:08] womb oh I should say the church is the
[1:07:12] womb and the church has always had those
[1:07:15] twins
[1:07:18] in within the framework of the Christian
[1:07:23] faith so here these we are calling
[1:07:25] themselves
[1:07:27] Apostles and yet they were
[1:07:30] Liars if you go in the second actually
[1:07:33] that very first
[1:07:35] church he talked about those that had
[1:07:38] the Deeds of the
[1:07:41] nians and he talked about the Saints who
[1:07:43] hated
[1:07:45] them and God said I also hate
[1:07:50] those so you see there was two
[1:07:53] churches growing parallel to each
[1:07:57] working
[1:07:58] together doing almost if you you don't
[1:08:01] have an
[1:08:02] understanding you will confus to you
[1:08:05] will confus to mean that all of them are
[1:08:07] the
[1:08:09] same in the Church of Jesus there are
[1:08:13] two
[1:08:13] seeds there are two twins and they are
[1:08:17] growing side by
[1:08:20] side you know if you look at the parable
[1:08:23] of the s
[1:08:25] The Good The Master of the field sold
[1:08:27] good
[1:08:28] seed and later on you know this bad one
[1:08:31] came and sold another SE
[1:08:34] night when men
[1:08:37] slept we can talk about that
[1:08:40] also look at how when the apostles
[1:08:43] died how you know the false this this
[1:08:46] false seed
[1:08:49] was by men who crept in
[1:08:52] Una and then before before you knew it
[1:08:56] there were two
[1:08:58] seeds growing side by side and then you
[1:09:02] know the servant say to the master
[1:09:05] should we go and and remove the Bad
[1:09:08] Seed he said leave it let it grow
[1:09:12] together because you may go to app The
[1:09:16] Good The Bad
[1:09:18] Seed and you may end up approaching the
[1:09:21] good one also let them grow
[1:09:24] together the time of the
[1:09:27] Harvest amen then The Bad Seed shall be
[1:09:30] removed and The Good Seed shall be taken
[1:09:33] into
[1:09:34] the let me tell you friends we we have
[1:09:37] arrived at that
[1:09:39] time we are at Harvest
[1:09:42] time we are in the end time that's why
[1:09:44] we called end time Message
[1:09:47] Church a time when the seed has
[1:09:50] mature when God is getting ready to send
[1:09:52] the angels
[1:09:55] harest The Good
[1:09:57] Seed there others will die in their
[1:10:00] organizations and in their
[1:10:03] systems because he said every
[1:10:04] organization is butchered right into
[1:10:09] it God never did organiz his
[1:10:13] church you know before I forget I'll
[1:10:16] tell you there's something going on
[1:10:17] right
[1:10:19] now you know there's a bill that has
[1:10:21] been uh you
[1:10:23] know debated in the parliament
[1:10:28] a marage the marriage bill the new
[1:10:30] marriage
[1:10:32] bill and so there have been men that
[1:10:36] have come
[1:10:37] up from different
[1:10:40] denominations and they have gone into
[1:10:42] the
[1:10:43] parliament to give their
[1:10:46] ideas on how um you know they their view
[1:10:51] of marriage according to the Bible
[1:10:55] and they have wanted some of those
[1:10:56] things to be
[1:11:01] legislated different denominations went
[1:11:04] there and there came up a man who claims
[1:11:08] to believe this
[1:11:09] message actually he went there and he
[1:11:12] and it was read that he's is
[1:11:14] representing the enti message
[1:11:19] church and his idea
[1:11:21] was that polygamy is also part of the
[1:11:24] scriptures
[1:11:29] should be also
[1:11:33] legalized and these men started
[1:11:36] speaking and one of the men from the
[1:11:38] inter religious
[1:11:40] Council you know made a comment talking
[1:11:43] about the message
[1:11:44] church as
[1:11:46] Rebels but you see does this man
[1:11:48] represent
[1:11:49] us does he represent us
[1:11:52] church he doesn't represent us but he's
[1:11:55] a
[1:11:57] twin we can't reject him to be our
[1:12:00] brother he's our brother he's our twin
[1:12:04] brother they claim to believe the
[1:12:06] message of brother
[1:12:07] brother they waving around the message
[1:12:09] of marriage and
[1:12:13] divorce and they claiming to believe
[1:12:15] things which the prophet never
[1:12:19] propagated it is a Revival this message
[1:12:23] is it's the Bri
[1:12:25] Ral but within this
[1:12:28] revival there must be
[1:12:32] another the one who is the bad one but
[1:12:36] I'm so glad I'm the one who is the good
[1:12:39] one Hallelujah the world will see her
[1:12:44] another twin and they will B us together
[1:12:48] but they don't know that is a Jacob
[1:12:50] somewhere there may be
[1:12:53] an yes we are all from the
[1:12:57] but I tell you what there isob in
[1:13:02] the hallelujah amen and pray for us
[1:13:06] because we are planning together with
[1:13:09] other
[1:13:10] pastors to go and make a
[1:13:14] statement and and also do a press
[1:13:18] conference do a press release go to the
[1:13:21] parliament I've already spoken to the
[1:13:24] the head of that committee
[1:13:27] who happens to be the uncle of brother
[1:13:29] Andrew and he has told he told us they
[1:13:32] close but he said we'll give you a
[1:13:33] moment give a
[1:13:35] chance when the other inter religious
[1:13:37] Council comes you will all
[1:13:40] come so by God's grace the Lord willing
[1:13:44] we are going to go there and we are
[1:13:46] going to show them no there is another
[1:13:48] twin in this
[1:13:52] revival two Nations
[1:13:55] people we are the other
[1:13:58] side the devil might try to project
[1:14:02] himself and I don't know why but usually
[1:14:05] the problem is with the older
[1:14:10] twins the one who comes
[1:14:13] first that is always a problem with him
[1:14:17] there was a problem with
[1:14:18] K he was the Elder there was a problem
[1:14:22] with with is he was the Elder
[1:14:25] and there was a problem with with Judas
[1:14:28] he was the Elder and Jesus said all
[1:14:31] those who came before me theves and
[1:14:36] robbers and and you know who went to the
[1:14:38] parliament
[1:14:43] first and if you want to see
[1:14:46] polygamy it started on the line of
[1:14:55] but I'm so glad there is a right kind of
[1:15:00] twin in every
[1:15:02] Revival there has been those
[1:15:04] twins every Revival produces twins the
[1:15:09] prop Hallelujah and and Isaac is well
[1:15:14] represented every time there's a Revival
[1:15:16] there is an es born and a Jacob
[1:15:20] born I was Wonder these people don't
[1:15:22] even have an idea
[1:15:26] they they have no
[1:15:29] idea of how many message Believers are
[1:15:32] in this
[1:15:34] country even we have no
[1:15:36] idea did you know that in the Christian
[1:15:41] faith the Believers of this ENT
[1:15:44] message in this country have a very huge
[1:15:53] percentage I believe we more than
[1:15:55] 200,000
[1:15:59] Believers that's a huge
[1:16:02] number from among the Born Again
[1:16:04] [Music]
[1:16:06] Believers if we were to be an
[1:16:10] organization we would have been
[1:16:12] controlling some of the events in the
[1:16:16] government I see some of these ones who
[1:16:17] have only
[1:16:21] 100,50 because they have an
[1:16:23] organization system govern they have
[1:16:26] their headquarters they have
[1:16:29] bishop
[1:16:32] and think they have a
[1:16:34] big but the Believers are many many many
[1:16:37] more in this
[1:16:39] country and they came up a
[1:16:41] brother it was just an opinion and I
[1:16:45] just want to say this because I want to
[1:16:47] make a
[1:16:48] comment why don't we make a
[1:16:51] document an overall document
[1:16:56] and we list what we
[1:16:59] believe our
[1:17:02] there I gave a
[1:17:04] comment and I said I don't believe in
[1:17:07] that I said this is where our doctr
[1:17:12] are we don't need because if you the
[1:17:14] moment you begin to
[1:17:17] organize the first thing is going to be
[1:17:19] the a document which states our beliefs
[1:17:26] then the second thing is going to be let
[1:17:28] us elect our
[1:17:31] leaders then the
[1:17:33] third let us also be recognized by the
[1:17:38] government let us wear
[1:17:41] robes
[1:17:42] callers let us also ask for cars from
[1:17:45] the
[1:17:47] president the way other as I
[1:17:49] receiv and before you know it we have
[1:17:53] organized as prophet when they
[1:17:56] organized they die we may look
[1:18:00] disorganized but we are the most
[1:18:02] organized body in the whole
[1:18:05] world because the body of Christ is not
[1:18:10] disorganized the body of Christ knows
[1:18:13] where she's standing she's standing on
[1:18:15] the Solid Rock of
[1:18:17] Ages Rock of the world believe all over
[1:18:21] the world they believe in Malachi 4 they
[1:18:25] believe in baptism in Jesus name they
[1:18:27] believe in one God we don't need to
[1:18:29] debate about
[1:18:31] it but you know
[1:18:33] what he knows those who are
[1:18:38] his you remember God never even wanted
[1:18:41] the Jews to be
[1:18:44] counted we don't need to count the
[1:18:47] believer we don't need it the government
[1:18:50] may need it at some
[1:18:53] point we don't need it God doesn't need
[1:18:57] it because he knows those who are
[1:19:02] his hallelujah hallelujah every Revival
[1:19:05] produces
[1:19:07] Twins and we talked about uh the
[1:19:10] difference and we looked at the lon of
[1:19:13] es and we saw that es hated the
[1:19:18] B he was afraid of it he hated it but we
[1:19:24] see that
[1:19:25] Jacob Jacob
[1:19:27] loved Jacob like es were born in a
[1:19:32] family and both of them had bad elements
[1:19:35] in
[1:19:37] them we were born in this world like
[1:19:41] them we have bad elements in
[1:19:43] us but you know because we are the good
[1:19:46] twin there is something that we are
[1:19:49] hungry
[1:19:51] for a child of God no matter which
[1:19:53] family or tribe born in you are
[1:19:55] hungering for the
[1:20:01] bir you are not happy when you don't
[1:20:05] live
[1:20:06] right you cannot comfortable in
[1:20:10] sin you cannot continue in in a fallen
[1:20:13] Fallen back
[1:20:16] condition you cannot
[1:20:19] rest until something has
[1:20:22] happened now I want I I I I I I'm not
[1:20:25] going to read again what I
[1:20:28] read but I I want to read a portion of
[1:20:33] it he says so it didn't mean anything to
[1:20:39] es he despised it and the can believer
[1:20:43] today still despises that
[1:20:46] bir and the bir right is the holy
[1:20:50] spirit they canot believe a despises
[1:20:53] that
[1:20:55] or you would say them days are
[1:20:57] pass there's no such a thing as
[1:20:59] receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:21:02] anymore that was back in the apostles
[1:21:05] times you know say you have have you
[1:21:08] ever received the
[1:21:09] Holy I don't think a big
[1:21:13] deal I believe the message brother
[1:21:17] sister there is the true baptism of the
[1:21:19] Holy
[1:21:21] Spirit and if you are not sure then you
[1:21:24] need to be sure
[1:21:27] you need to be sure that you
[1:21:31] have it was then it is still
[1:21:34] now I had a great man say one time and I
[1:21:37] would read this he says he said
[1:21:39] Pentecost was only a scaffold work to
[1:21:40] the
[1:21:45] building and he said then after the
[1:21:47] building is made why we don't need those
[1:21:50] scaffold
[1:21:53] anymore at the end of the service I came
[1:21:55] and shook his
[1:21:57] hand and I I I made a
[1:22:00] compliment and I told him doctor I said
[1:22:03] I will agree with you that Pentecost was
[1:22:05] a scaffold
[1:22:08] one as long as we are building on
[1:22:12] it we still have to have the
[1:22:15] scaffold amen as long as we are still
[1:22:17] building is the building
[1:22:19] finished answer me Church the building
[1:22:22] is still being built
[1:22:24] that means we still need a
[1:22:27] scff and he says until you put the end
[1:22:30] of the spire on the tip top
[1:22:33] there you still have to have
[1:22:36] the and I'm glad tonight to be working
[1:22:40] on the
[1:22:41] building standing on the scaffold then
[1:22:44] we amen we still need the Holy Ghost we
[1:22:48] still need a
[1:22:49] bathro because we are still building the
[1:22:52] building
[1:22:54] have not concluded yet and the prophet
[1:22:57] said you know you can call them Holy
[1:23:01] Rollers you can call them anything you
[1:23:04] want
[1:23:05] to but you know they will not care for
[1:23:08] anything
[1:23:09] else but that
[1:23:12] b you know Jacob didn't care what it
[1:23:15] cost
[1:23:16] him if it was a mess
[1:23:19] Portage he was glad to give it
[1:23:22] to so it is with so is it with any man
[1:23:24] or woman that has been ordained to
[1:23:27] eternal
[1:23:31] life man that God has called to eternal
[1:23:34] life he's willing to sell out
[1:23:38] anything anything of the world to obtain
[1:23:41] that
[1:23:43] bir listen to me if you still desire
[1:23:46] certain things in the
[1:23:48] world you cannot have the
[1:23:51] birth if you still love that boyfriend
[1:23:55] or that girlfriend and you are not
[1:23:58] willing to
[1:23:59] release or let go you can never receive
[1:24:02] the if you're not willing to give up you
[1:24:06] know those bad
[1:24:09] videos bad music and going out bad
[1:24:14] places your heart doesn't like
[1:24:16] it but you want it but you don't want it
[1:24:21] but you're holding on you are still
[1:24:23] holding on the moment you continue to be
[1:24:26] like that you can never receive the
[1:24:29] bir it is so easy to receive the
[1:24:32] birath by the
[1:24:34] way the man said
[1:24:36] es give me the Portage and I'll give you
[1:24:40] the said will he give me the B he said
[1:24:43] yes just just
[1:24:47] exchange what he had was physical but
[1:24:51] the bir was not physical
[1:24:54] the B was spiritual the holy spirit is
[1:24:59] spiritual you know you you give up
[1:25:01] something you
[1:25:02] see you give up a physical thing to
[1:25:06] receive something
[1:25:09] spiritual that's
[1:25:11] why es despised
[1:25:14] it because he felt it is not of
[1:25:17] value but things of value are not seen
[1:25:20] with
[1:25:22] eyes there is something right now now
[1:25:24] that you are
[1:25:26] receiving but you are not seeing it with
[1:25:28] naked
[1:25:29] eyes but don't you worry the world may
[1:25:33] despise it the world may despise you
[1:25:35] even for coming to sit and
[1:25:38] listen but there is something you are
[1:25:42] receiving and it is not seen with Naked
[1:25:44] Eyes there is something
[1:25:47] spiritual there is a land we are going
[1:25:49] to it's not seen with physical you have
[1:25:53] to be in the
[1:25:55] to see it by eyes
[1:25:57] of Amen we are walking a walk of what
[1:26:02] fa this is not money it is more than
[1:26:07] money this is not you know Prestige is
[1:26:10] more than houses is more than anything
[1:26:12] the world can
[1:26:14] give the word will give you something
[1:26:17] the world will never be able to give
[1:26:24] God will give you
[1:26:26] things that God has already given
[1:26:30] you my my mind that's why
[1:26:34] Christians we decide to let
[1:26:37] go to release the world to leave the
[1:26:41] world and follow
[1:26:44] Jesus you can say I've
[1:26:47] decided to follow
[1:26:50] Jesus and that's you have to be ready to
[1:26:53] let go
[1:26:56] you have to meet God on his
[1:26:59] requirement and then looked at walking
[1:27:01] alone after receiving the
[1:27:04] B but tonight in the next 30 minutes or
[1:27:09] so I want us to look at a quot in in the
[1:27:12] Ephesian
[1:27:15] church about the twins
[1:27:18] there in Genesis 4
[1:27:21] 41 brother bam says
[1:27:24] notice the exact way the the record of
[1:27:27] God sets forth the account of the births
[1:27:29] of Cain Abel and
[1:27:37] S
[1:27:40] and in Genesis
[1:27:43] 412 it says and Adam knew Eve his
[1:27:48] wife and she conceived and bear
[1:27:51] can and said I have got a man from the
[1:27:57] Lord and she again bear his brother
[1:28:01] Abel and then now vers
[1:28:07] 25 and Adam knew his wife
[1:28:10] again and she bear a
[1:28:14] son and called his
[1:28:19] name now I want you I'm going slow here
[1:28:22] because I want you to catch it
[1:28:25] there are three sons born from two acts
[1:28:28] of can knowledge by
[1:28:37] Adam how many
[1:28:39] times how many signs out of
[1:28:42] it three since the Bible is the exact
[1:28:46] and perfect word of
[1:28:49] God this is not mistake but a record of
[1:28:51] our illumination for our illumination
[1:28:57] since three sons were born from two acts
[1:29:00] by
[1:29:04] Adam you know positively that one of
[1:29:07] those three was not the son of
[1:29:12] Adam God has recorded this in the exact
[1:29:15] manner to show us
[1:29:19] something the truth of the matter is
[1:29:23] that had in her womb two sons
[1:29:29] twins from separate
[1:29:34] impregnations she was calling
[1:29:37] twins with K's conception sometime
[1:29:41] previous to that of
[1:29:46] ab see those twins
[1:29:49] again now now don't miss this
[1:29:53] please we have looked at the scenario of
[1:29:58] Rea and two
[1:30:00] sons is and are you following
[1:30:04] me es and
[1:30:07] Jacob and Jacob we both seeds from one
[1:30:12] man
[1:30:15] Isaac natural
[1:30:18] seed there's something I want to show
[1:30:20] you the children of God
[1:30:22] today are not born from from the natural
[1:30:24] seed of your
[1:30:28] father you are born from the spiritual
[1:30:31] seed of your
[1:30:37] father you have a
[1:30:40] [Music]
[1:30:44] father that one will never give birth to
[1:30:47] a seed of
[1:30:49] God but there is also your father
[1:30:52] spiritual
[1:30:54] who is God and he also has a
[1:30:58] seed and that seed is the
[1:31:01] word that one will always give birth to
[1:31:04] sons of
[1:31:06] God so there was K and there was but
[1:31:11] here we see in the
[1:31:12] beginning at first they were supposed to
[1:31:16] be seeds from a natural
[1:31:20] father are you following me
[1:31:24] okay I I just hope that you get the
[1:31:28] revation let's carry on she was now we
[1:31:32] see you know the
[1:31:35] woman Eve is carrying twins
[1:31:40] in of separate
[1:31:44] impregnations she was calling
[1:31:46] twins with can's conception sometime
[1:31:49] meaning she conceived
[1:31:53] first she conceived
[1:31:56] Abel and the father of
[1:31:58] Cain was not the father of
[1:32:02] Abel the father of was the
[1:32:06] serent the father of
[1:32:09] was if you following
[1:32:12] say perfect type
[1:32:16] always to those who think that that is
[1:32:18] not
[1:32:20] possible because I mean it's like
[1:32:22] mindboggling
[1:32:25] how one
[1:32:27] woman have twins in a
[1:32:29] womb from two different
[1:32:32] fathers at the same time is it possible
[1:32:37] yes let it be known that medical
[1:32:43] records are rep with cases where women
[1:32:46] have cared
[1:32:51] twins who were of separate over and
[1:32:54] separate insemination with the
[1:32:55] fertilization of the egg being days
[1:33:04] apart and not only so but some of the
[1:33:08] records
[1:33:09] show that the twins were fed by separate
[1:33:15] males
[1:33:17] recently worldwide coverage was given to
[1:33:20] a Norwegian mother who was suing her
[1:33:22] husband for support for herself and her
[1:33:29] [Music]
[1:33:32] twins one of which was
[1:33:35] White and the other Twi was black she
[1:33:39] admitted that she had a negro
[1:33:44] lover the two
[1:33:46] conceptions were about three weeks
[1:33:52] apart hey
[1:33:55] three weeks
[1:33:57] apart hband and then
[1:34:00] a two different
[1:34:02] children Black and
[1:34:05] White born at the same time twin black
[1:34:10] and white two different fathers same
[1:34:14] mother same wom is it possible yes it
[1:34:19] happened in
[1:34:20] America even at the time of
[1:34:22] brother happened in e
[1:34:25] happened in Uganda some of you read the
[1:34:27] news some years ago it has now since
[1:34:30] happened many many
[1:34:31] times and medically
[1:34:34] proven but by the time brother preached
[1:34:38] this it was medically not yet
[1:34:42] proven you are looking for
[1:34:48] vations that is the true prophet of
[1:34:50] Malachi
[1:34:51] 4 Elijah the prophet of
[1:34:54] our this is one of
[1:34:57] them he told
[1:35:00] something before even science
[1:35:03] discovered and when science discovered
[1:35:07] it only confirmed what God had
[1:35:11] said oh my
[1:35:14] God can you imagine it because brother
[1:35:18] bam say Kan was not a son of
[1:35:21] Adam he was a TW
[1:35:24] in the wom
[1:35:27] ofy
[1:35:30] the they were noted by the
[1:35:33] same in the same way I want you to know
[1:35:38] that is why
[1:35:39] Eve means mother of all
[1:35:43] [Music]
[1:35:46] living
[1:35:48] but means Son of God
[1:35:53] and when did Eve become
[1:35:55] Eve she became Eve after having the
[1:35:59] twin what does it
[1:36:02] mean Adam was a father of only the
[1:36:05] children of
[1:36:10] God mother the good and the
[1:36:14] bad all that are living on Earth but
[1:36:19] Adam did not
[1:36:22] F that's why when you search your
[1:36:25] scriptures you will never find in the
[1:36:27] genealogies of
[1:36:30] Adam you will never find there and the B
[1:36:34] says Enoch was the s from
[1:36:37] Adam and when you count those seven
[1:36:41] generations Kan is
[1:36:44] nonexistent yet the lineage of Cain
[1:36:48] continued contined
[1:36:51] and so what am I trying to say
[1:36:54] that Cain has never been a son of
[1:36:56] Adam C was mothered by
[1:37:00] Eve and remember Eve is a type of the
[1:37:05] church a woman according to the
[1:37:07] scripture she's always the type of the
[1:37:11] church so she mothered the
[1:37:14] twins oh praise the name of the
[1:37:18] Lord and these
[1:37:20] twins today in the Church of Jesus
[1:37:24] you know we are supposed to be the wife
[1:37:25] of
[1:37:26] Jesus the first wife of
[1:37:29] Adam had
[1:37:31] twins but these twins we are from two
[1:37:34] different
[1:37:35] father the second
[1:37:37] Church of Adam the second the church
[1:37:42] today also has
[1:37:44] twins but those twins are also from two
[1:37:47] different
[1:37:49] father not all those
[1:37:51] twins are from Jesus
[1:37:55] they have the name of Jesus they call
[1:37:58] themselves fathered by
[1:38:00] Jesus but Jesus rejects them he says I
[1:38:04] am not your father and what reason does
[1:38:07] he give he said because you reject my
[1:38:11] word I cannot be your father and he he
[1:38:15] looked at them and he said you of your
[1:38:18] father the devil and they said what we
[1:38:22] are children of Abraham
[1:38:24] he said If Abraham was your father you
[1:38:27] would have listened to me because
[1:38:29] Abraham listened to me in other words
[1:38:33] today we have people in the framework of
[1:38:36] the Christian
[1:38:38] faith but when they are not truly sons
[1:38:41] of
[1:38:43] God when they are not truly the children
[1:38:46] of
[1:38:47] God but they call themselves by the name
[1:38:50] of
[1:38:51] Christ and they in every Church
[1:38:59] Ral the womb let's look at the wom
[1:39:03] little in the message the
[1:39:06] pain and Jacob I don't care what he is
[1:39:10] he wants that b he is the spiritual one
[1:39:14] and them two
[1:39:16] today is in the womb of the
[1:39:19] church and ab jaob and in the wom of the
[1:39:24] church there is a great big system
[1:39:26] trying to be
[1:39:28] formed called The World Council of
[1:39:32] churches and from the womb of the
[1:39:35] church is coming forth two
[1:39:37] children he said you just mark my
[1:39:42] word brother bam talked about the coming
[1:39:45] of the world C of churches before it
[1:39:51] came and he said all this Nations will
[1:39:55] join but only the bride will
[1:39:58] not that's another Vindication for
[1:40:03] you and it has formed
[1:40:07] now and people will join
[1:40:10] it but the bride will never
[1:40:13] join the word must deliver the word
[1:40:16] bride
[1:40:19] church the church has got to be
[1:40:22] delivered out of her
[1:40:25] a bride for Christ them that fell asleep
[1:40:28] in all ages will make up that bride that
[1:40:30] come out on the word that they came out
[1:40:39] on like from your
[1:40:42] feet coming to your
[1:40:45] head she gets
[1:40:47] greater and more you have to have and so
[1:40:50] forth
[1:40:53] the body grows
[1:40:54] up so does the body of Christ grow
[1:40:59] up and then
[1:41:01] finally the head will
[1:41:03] come to it the head of it will now if we
[1:41:08] know because it's all linked to the
[1:41:13] head but these systems will not grow out
[1:41:16] of
[1:41:18] that because it's a
[1:41:21] system and it can bring
[1:41:24] forth a CO cannot bring forth a bunch of
[1:41:31] wheat but they are both in the same
[1:41:34] field watered by the same water and the
[1:41:38] same
[1:41:39] sunlight one is the word one is not the
[1:41:43] word and them two are
[1:41:46] fighting they've been fighting since the
[1:41:48] first
[1:41:50] reformation and they are still fighting
[1:41:54] and even in in the church today those
[1:41:57] two Spirits are still
[1:41:59] fighting the spiritual
[1:42:01] belever and the canot
[1:42:04] believer the spiritual believer will
[1:42:07] always be interested in the
[1:42:11] B the
[1:42:13] believer is not
[1:42:15] interested as long as he goes to church
[1:42:19] he pays his TI he's a good Christian but
[1:42:22] a spiritual belie will not rest until
[1:42:26] she has the
[1:42:27] B the spiritual believer is not out of
[1:42:31] the
[1:42:32] systems but she is linked to the
[1:42:37] Head Christ the word she comes out of
[1:42:41] the word amen and he says these are very
[1:42:45] important
[1:42:47] things a CO cannot bring forth we
[1:42:53] but they both in the same
[1:42:57] field we have the same
[1:43:00] church but this
[1:43:04] church it has two different
[1:43:07] crops it has two different
[1:43:11] seeds but they in the same
[1:43:14] ground they take the same water they
[1:43:17] take the same spirit is the same word
[1:43:21] the atmosphere is the same
[1:43:23] the one
[1:43:25] seed one seed cannot bear the word the
[1:43:28] other one Whatever thing you do no
[1:43:32] matter what you do it will bear the word
[1:43:35] there is something I want you to see he
[1:43:37] says when you have a
[1:43:39] CO and you have the wheat they in the
[1:43:42] same field they receiving the same water
[1:43:46] they receiving the same
[1:43:48] Sun Even in our
[1:43:50] churches not all of us are the bride
[1:43:55] this message listen get two two two
[1:44:00] seeds them in the
[1:44:02] church begin to water them by the word
[1:44:07] the more preachers
[1:44:09] preach the more some people are becoming
[1:44:11] great
[1:44:17] Sinners and you wonder
[1:44:21] why in the
[1:44:23] church that's why I tell you never blame
[1:44:27] any
[1:44:30] Pastor if he preaching the true
[1:44:33] word if a pastor is preaching the
[1:44:36] word and people are becoming
[1:44:39] worse it is only because there is a
[1:44:42] problem in the seed
[1:44:47] area
[1:44:48] but because if you plant maze
[1:44:53] and you water it and you give it
[1:44:56] sunshine because the water has been too
[1:44:58] much and sunshine has been too
[1:45:02] much now we are going to get
[1:45:08] whe is it possible you can only have
[1:45:13] maze you can only have
[1:45:16] maze because it is the original City
[1:45:19] planted you can only Avest the original
[1:45:22] that you
[1:45:26] planted the word has been preached for
[1:45:28] 2000
[1:45:31] years
[1:45:32] generation it has been vesting the
[1:45:35] original
[1:45:37] SE when was I
[1:45:40] planted I was planted before the
[1:45:43] foundation of the
[1:45:45] world that's why I
[1:45:47] believe there are people that are living
[1:45:51] on Earth to today and the generations
[1:45:55] before and those to come that can never
[1:45:59] test
[1:46:00] hell that can never be
[1:46:03] lost no matter what the devil does to
[1:46:06] say no matter what they go
[1:46:09] through no matter even which SCS they
[1:46:12] were a part
[1:46:14] of are you getting my point why because
[1:46:18] they were the original
[1:46:21] SE planted by God in the
[1:46:25] beginning when you power the word out it
[1:46:28] will just make them recognize who they
[1:46:32] are amen amen amen amen when you preach
[1:46:36] the same word and you preach Grace the
[1:46:40] other seed which is bad will just become
[1:46:44] worse they will use
[1:46:47] grace sin but the original
[1:46:51] sin when they hear
[1:46:53] Grace they will use Grace to be
[1:46:57] deliver and to come out of
[1:47:00] sin amen the problem is in the
[1:47:05] seed which kind of seed are
[1:47:08] you which twin are
[1:47:11] you are you the spiritual
[1:47:14] one or the the kind
[1:47:18] one that's why there is no Pastor who
[1:47:21] can save anyone
[1:47:25] sometimes I I when I make that
[1:47:28] statement I make it out of a lot of
[1:47:32] pain because an
[1:47:34] experience I am
[1:47:36] one person I did not know I was like
[1:47:40] that but I discovered I had a heart for
[1:47:45] people I believed everyone can be
[1:47:49] saved I've been
[1:47:57] you put your hand on someone and I pray
[1:47:59] for them I will preach to them I will
[1:48:03] teach them I will instruct them and then
[1:48:06] eventually the more you do it looks like
[1:48:09] you driving them
[1:48:13] to I learned the hard
[1:48:16] way there are some people who can never
[1:48:18] be
[1:48:20] saved no matter what you do
[1:48:25] so because I learned
[1:48:27] that I
[1:48:31] reduced I now decided to S the seed of
[1:48:35] the
[1:48:36] word if you are a seed you
[1:48:40] will when you hear it you will
[1:48:45] it I don't want to
[1:48:48] myself if you are not to get saved you
[1:48:51] never get saved but if you are to
[1:48:54] get and is a seed of God let me tell
[1:48:59] you even if you here one
[1:49:02] service I want come to your home and
[1:49:11] pleas it is not to be
[1:49:13] bed it knows what it
[1:49:16] is it is the word which proves
[1:49:19] it say Amen that is me
[1:49:24] the womb is the
[1:49:25] church which is Christianity many will
[1:49:28] claim to be that
[1:49:30] church but watch their
[1:49:32] life does it align with the
[1:49:35] word if you don't want it you don't want
[1:49:37] it and let me tell you if you don't want
[1:49:40] it don't force yourself go and enjoy the
[1:49:44] world because you are wasting much
[1:49:49] time you would have enjoyed the world a
[1:49:51] lot
[1:49:56] than being in church and under
[1:50:00] rules if you take a
[1:50:02] pig and you you wash it and you clean it
[1:50:06] and you tell it now baby pig let me even
[1:50:10] perfume from today you see that M out
[1:50:14] there never go to
[1:50:17] [Music]
[1:50:19] eat and then you lock
[1:50:22] will be there when it rains it will
[1:50:26] start
[1:50:27] singing
[1:50:29] thiss rules there are too much these
[1:50:34] laws rules I am locked up here because
[1:50:38] it a pig when ites mad
[1:50:42] out I can't
[1:50:44] wait I just want to
[1:50:47] go myself
[1:50:52] they M oh my God they
[1:50:56] enjoying look at the to
[1:51:08] enjoy laws the big will always see
[1:51:13] laws rules but a child of God even
[1:51:17] listen listen even before you
[1:51:19] change even before you change
[1:51:22] moment you get contacted by the
[1:51:25] word you'll be
[1:51:28] convicted and you'll be like the
[1:51:30] prodal I don't belong
[1:51:33] here how did I get myself into this
[1:51:37] mess I'm not supposed to be here what
[1:51:41] happened to me how did I begin to eat
[1:51:44] with
[1:51:45] pigs what's wrong with me my heart is
[1:51:49] yearning for Holiness my heart is for
[1:51:53] right I want to be like what they
[1:51:56] want why because you a child of you have
[1:52:01] always been a child of God there is
[1:52:03] something in you
[1:52:05] calling for that
[1:52:07] righteousness that Holiness listen what
[1:52:11] makes the difference is not what you do
[1:52:15] what makes the difference what your
[1:52:17] desire
[1:52:19] is it shows you who you are
[1:52:23] you cannot fake
[1:52:26] that it is
[1:52:29] original you you can only have the
[1:52:32] appetite for who you
[1:52:39] are so as I'm finishing Matthew
[1:52:44] 244 says there shall arise forse
[1:52:47] Christ and false prophets and they shall
[1:52:50] show great signs and wonders
[1:52:53] in so much that if it were
[1:52:55] possible they shall receive the very
[1:52:58] El and the prophet message leadership is
[1:53:01] say false prophets the Bible say in the
[1:53:04] last days there would be false
[1:53:06] prophets Jesus said there shall rise
[1:53:08] forse
[1:53:09] Christ not false Jesus now nobody stands
[1:53:14] still for
[1:53:15] that but false Christ Christ means the
[1:53:18] anointed
[1:53:19] one fely anointed
[1:53:22] they are
[1:53:24] anointed but they are FSE at the bottom
[1:53:27] of and they do good signs and
[1:53:29] wonders they speak in tongu they dance
[1:53:32] in the spirit they preach the gospel
[1:53:36] Judas isar did
[1:53:37] it I mean
[1:53:40] prophesied the
[1:53:42] hypocrite they done all signs
[1:53:44] everything all the religious
[1:53:47] moves but you see you put a CO seed
[1:53:53] and a we SE in the same bed and power
[1:53:55] the water down upon
[1:53:58] them and anoint them they will both
[1:54:02] Rejoice they will both grow by it in the
[1:54:05] same water The Sun Shines on the just
[1:54:08] and the
[1:54:09] unjust and the rain falls on the unjust
[1:54:12] and the
[1:54:13] unjust by their fruits you shall know
[1:54:16] them how can you keep from lining up
[1:54:18] with the
[1:54:20] word see what I mean the water falls on
[1:54:23] the just and the
[1:54:25] unjust anointed Jesus said they will
[1:54:29] come to me in that day they say Lord
[1:54:31] Lord I have
[1:54:33] not I have not done
[1:54:36] prophesy done good things in your name
[1:54:39] he would say you workers of
[1:54:40] iniquity depart from me I don't even
[1:54:43] know you go into eternal
[1:54:46] hell that's been prepared for the devil
[1:54:48] and his
[1:54:50] angels you see what a word
[1:54:52] fely Worship in vain striving in vain
[1:54:57] why do you do what when you don't have
[1:55:00] to do
[1:55:02] it why take a substitute when the
[1:55:04] heavens is full of the
[1:55:09] Gen you don't have to do
[1:55:12] that
[1:55:15] using let us stop pretending if you have
[1:55:19] not changed you have not yet
[1:55:21] changed your
[1:55:23] desire work on
[1:55:25] that satisfy your
[1:55:28] desire whoever you are satisfy your
[1:55:33] desire of course the
[1:55:36] flesh is the other twin
[1:55:39] also will never age with
[1:55:44] you but your heart in your
[1:55:48] soul another twin that's the real you
[1:55:52] I'm talking about that one what do you
[1:55:54] desire in
[1:55:56] there the reason why you come to
[1:55:59] church because you have a
[1:56:02] desire that's why you said let me go to
[1:56:05] church even when the flesh your
[1:56:10] brother
[1:56:12] says
[1:56:14] tired you don't need to go to
[1:56:18] church always you be
[1:56:21] Church what's wrong with you and you
[1:56:25] like and then you hear Jacob
[1:56:29] speak I'm
[1:56:31] hungry give up that
[1:56:35] page just go and get a birath right and
[1:56:39] say I can't wait I can't wait something
[1:56:41] comes all over you I have to go to
[1:56:44] church and that's why you are here and
[1:56:47] that's why you're Turing in on zo and
[1:56:48] that's why you're here in the word why
[1:56:50] because you have something calling for
[1:56:54] that proves my friends that you are a
[1:56:58] child of
[1:57:01] God the man of a
[1:57:04] person that desires the
[1:57:06] word you can't you can't you know try
[1:57:10] and
[1:57:12] pretend even when brother
[1:57:15] es you scared of him all the
[1:57:18] time you're trying to run away from
[1:57:21] him but I tell you this don't fear
[1:57:25] anymore the moment you get a
[1:57:27] bir let me tell you what the bir does to

[1:57:59] all fear the
[1:58:01] flesh they always
[1:58:03] afraid they even themselves fear
[1:58:07] themselves ever since I got the ho
[1:58:09] spirit I stopped fearing
[1:58:11] myself I stopped fearing what the devil
[1:58:14] can do because I
[1:58:16] know there are certain things that devil
[1:58:18] cannot use
[1:58:20] me when when
[1:58:22] when Jacob fought with the
[1:58:24] angel he said now he was running away
[1:58:28] you remember
[1:58:31] from sending gifts to appease him he
[1:58:35] stopped sending gifts he stopped
[1:58:38] appeasing the flesh he said let me go
[1:58:42] f I am more than
[1:58:44] able to face him if he kills me he kills
[1:58:48] me if I die I die but let me go first
