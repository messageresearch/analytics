[1:19:18] and of course we all know on sunday was
[1:19:20] speaking on redemption of our souls
[1:19:25] the lion of the tribe of judah became
[1:19:27] the lamb
[1:19:31] to see the lions
[1:19:33] employees
[1:20:28] i saw another mighty angel come down
[1:20:30] from heaven close to the clouds
[1:20:35] and a rainbow was upon his head
[1:20:40] and his face was actually where the sun
[1:20:41] and his uh his feet are spirits of fire
[1:20:44] namaste
[1:20:54] and he
[1:20:55] had in his hand a little book open
[1:20:59] and he said
[1:21:03] and his left foot
[1:21:06] and
[1:21:08] verse 3 and cried with a loud voice come
[1:21:12] on you can preach with me as when
[1:21:15] a lion roared
[1:21:17] and when he had cried
[1:21:19] seven thunders uttered their voices
[1:21:23] all right
[1:21:24] now look at verse four
[1:21:26] when the seven thunders uttered their
[1:21:29] voices
[1:21:30] i was about to write
[1:21:33] so the thunders had contents everyone
[1:21:36] had to come beyond him the thunders were
[1:21:39] not the sounds
[1:22:02] but the voice spoke to him and said
[1:22:04] there was a name auntie listen carefully
[1:22:07] brunch i was about to write i didn't
[1:22:09] understand i heard a voice from heaven
[1:22:11] saying unto me
[1:22:15] love those things
[1:22:18] the seven thought has happened
[1:22:19] everywhere to come somewhere you'll get
[1:22:21] rid of
[1:22:21] them not so to be wondering because john
[1:22:25] was not permitted you cannot yeah
[1:22:27] danielle in the book of uh
[1:22:29] daniel was not permitted too
[1:22:32] you know
[1:22:33] the anger told him find them up
[1:22:36] history
[1:22:50] and that would be the
[1:23:03] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:23:05] seventh angel
[1:23:09] sound
[1:23:10] the mystery of god should be finished
[1:23:17] as he has declared to his servants the
[1:23:18] prophets
[1:23:21] now do you see why it is important for
[1:23:23] us to receive the message of the seventh
[1:23:25] angels
[1:23:30] because the messengers the angels
[1:23:32] message
[1:23:54] [Applause]
[1:24:15] remained sealed
[1:24:18] it will remain safe
[1:24:20] until when took at the until when church
[1:24:26] until
[1:24:28] are you following me this morning
[1:24:31] this is for you
[1:24:33] tell somebody this is for you guys
[1:24:36] this is for you this morning
[1:24:41] the seventh angel malaya
[1:25:01] it's like a bible class this morning
[1:25:04] who is the revelation of who is the age
[1:25:06] of revelation 10 1 malaya
[1:25:10] yes
[1:25:12] jesus christ yes to christ the angel the
[1:25:15] mighty angel
[1:25:18] he comes down with what yak janaci
[1:25:21] an open book
[1:25:24] and it says naganba john do not write
[1:25:27] them you can't randy kevin you cannot
[1:25:29] write the contents
[1:25:31] but in the days
[1:25:33] of the voice is that
[1:25:34] the seventh ending
[1:25:37] this is a mystery
[1:25:47] [Applause]
[1:25:55] but without the messenger's message
[1:25:58] without the message of the seventh angel
[1:26:04] they are preaching half truth
[1:26:35] in the in the word of god that will
[1:26:37] remain filled forever
[1:26:44] his message
[1:26:46] when he comes
[1:26:47] to finish the mystery of god good job
[1:26:52] and the word of god is god
[1:26:56] someone will say he will finish the
[1:26:58] mystery of god
[1:27:01] he's going to finish all the mysteries
[1:27:03] of the bible
[1:27:07] the bible becomes a new book
[1:27:10] yeah and i think it was peter would say
[1:27:12] it now let us leave the doctrines of
[1:27:14] baptisms of of repentance of laying one
[1:27:17] of hands of peace of god let us go on
[1:27:20] unto perfection there was a petroleum
[1:27:22] again
[1:27:28] all the denominations just are laying
[1:27:30] the
[1:27:56] it is
[1:28:10] that's why some people get me get this
[1:28:12] message
[1:28:53] you are not going to be raptured talking
[1:28:56] you need to be capped off whether
[1:28:58] or not you need to be the omega bride
[1:29:01] wait a go room glory ascend by you
[1:29:04] praise the name of the lord come here
[1:29:06] and so now here in the book of
[1:29:07] revelation chapter six
[1:29:23] saying come and see.
[1:29:27] and i saw and behold a white horse
[1:29:32] and he that sat on him had a bow and had
[1:29:35] a crown
[1:29:36] and a crown was given out to him and he
[1:29:38] went for conquering unto conquer no yeah
[1:29:40] i took the congratulations
[1:29:46] you know the bible speaks of beasts
[1:29:50] could um
[1:30:05] beasts and the beasts
[1:30:09] sorrow
[1:30:11] all right
[1:30:12] now there are four living creatures what
[1:30:14] will a return the video which the bible
[1:30:17] also refers to as forbidden
[1:30:31] and this is the devil saturn
[1:30:36] and how people in the tribulation will
[1:30:38] get the mark of the beast
[1:30:44] actually they already get in the mark of
[1:30:45] the beast today by rejecting the
[1:30:46] revealed word
[1:31:01] and
[1:31:02] the things i'm speaking to you is
[1:31:04] because i have had the seventh angel's
[1:31:05] message
[1:31:09] so it's not my it's not i'm not the
[1:31:11] sauce
[1:31:14] the things we preach in this chat an
[1:31:15] introductory mechanism is because we
[1:31:17] have heard the message of the last days
[1:31:22] we have had the end-time message
[1:31:25] we have received the messenger of the
[1:31:26] end times
[1:31:42] to stand before you and i tell you i
[1:31:44] have heard the message of the hour
[1:31:46] bully
[1:31:50] i'm not ashamed to quote it for you i'll
[1:31:52] just see what you are saying
[1:31:55] preach i will claim to believe
[1:32:08] is
[1:32:19] now i was listening there is a very
[1:32:21] wonderful message that brother eddie
[1:32:22] biscuit preached some years ago
[1:32:36] and i found this this phrase very
[1:32:38] wonderful uh from that verb i quoted it
[1:32:41] and i thought i should read it for you
[1:32:46] uh coming from the from the north from
[1:32:49] northern canada and being a hunter yeah
[1:33:03] to be able to rest a while and then he
[1:33:05] would go hunting with brothers
[1:33:35] strong enough for the animal you intend
[1:33:38] to smell wabalang
[1:33:45] you lay it up on you lay it on its part
[1:33:48] where it usually passes for its food or
[1:33:52] for day-to-day life
[1:34:00] the snail is camouflaged
[1:34:10] you see the purpose of laying a snail is
[1:34:12] to cause death
[1:34:16] man is made with an instinct to worship
[1:34:24] and this beast
[1:34:26] has laid its snare on that path of man
[1:34:30] in sereno
[1:34:44] let me tell you every human being
[1:34:46] every month is created with any instinct
[1:34:49] to worship
[1:34:54] just loves worship
[1:34:56] within man to worship
[1:35:12] they have a tree called nakaima
[1:35:16] and people you know one day i went there
[1:35:18] roman again i wanted to see what the
[1:35:20] people do
[1:35:24] some people even forsake their homes
[1:35:40] and they begin praying to the tree
[1:35:43] because they believe this tree was a
[1:35:44] certain kind of spirit
[1:35:48] that formed itself into a tree guarding
[1:35:52] and so it's been there for ages and ages
[1:35:54] and edges
[1:36:08] people worship rivers catch up on
[1:36:10] questions and enemies people worship
[1:36:12] things around russian saving people
[1:36:14] because if they don't worship the living
[1:36:16] gods
[1:36:19] they will have to do something else to
[1:36:21] fulfill the instinct
[1:36:50] but i want to tell you that thing is
[1:36:51] jesus christ
[1:36:53] hallelujah amen and people need to
[1:36:55] realize that when you're taking that i
[1:36:57] have replaced jesus
[1:37:02] never take away
[1:37:32] listen i'm the devil yes
[1:37:36] worship me
[1:37:38] people are not gonna do that i'm gonna
[1:37:39] try to get your color how many of you
[1:37:40] are going to worship the devil when it
[1:37:41] tells you i'm in the devil
[1:37:46] there
[1:37:54] they don't worship in the churches they
[1:37:56] go to or in the worship classes they go
[1:37:58] to
[1:37:59] while in their
[1:38:14] they actually got to worship what are
[1:38:16] they necessary thinking they're
[1:38:18] worshipping god
[1:38:21] but i want to tell you
[1:38:23] that millions today are deceived
[1:38:28] the devil has ensnared them satania have
[1:38:31] a kissing on that path
[1:38:33] of worship
[1:38:35] the devil has trapped them standing at
[1:38:37] attention they never come out flagged as
[1:38:39] himself
[1:38:41] the trap is not in a in a glare for
[1:38:44] everybody to see ah category
[1:38:48] this is hidden
[1:38:50] and people get deceived
[1:38:54] but one thing i want to tell you this
[1:38:56] morning
[1:39:09] and you see
[1:39:11] uh this beast that i was speaking of
[1:39:15] the devil satan he comes in four in
[1:39:18] forms
[1:39:21] when the seals were broken
[1:39:24] brother
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:50] he says i say that a true church would
[1:39:52] always try to be like it was in the book
[1:39:54] of acts
[1:40:01] is that right
[1:40:03] but we have discovered that the word
[1:40:05] also teaches an invasion of error until
[1:40:07] there is a complete black out of truth
[1:40:20] and
[1:40:21] in the last day when the lord is about
[1:40:23] to appear there will be a total black
[1:40:26] out of truth
[1:40:43] that let them fall into a state of
[1:40:46] concrete deception catholic
[1:41:16] for there shall be he says in the
[1:41:17] scripture for there shall be shall arise
[1:41:20] false christ
[1:41:25] and the false prophet never christ
[1:41:28] shall show great signs
[1:41:30] and wonders
[1:41:52] there is a true church and a false
[1:41:54] church ow
[1:41:55] can you send two fools
[1:41:57] there is a true vine and a
[1:41:59] must have people seem to believe but of
[1:42:02] course that false church can you say
[1:42:05] that uh first fine buddy
[1:42:09] always strive to assert the position of
[1:42:12] the true church oh
[1:42:29] and of course they are able to do that
[1:42:30] because they have their fashion
[1:42:32] denominations
[1:42:37] and they will tell you that our
[1:42:38] denomination is actually the one with
[1:42:40] the truth
[1:42:43] that's why we do not do that here
[1:42:47] because we believe that when we baptize
[1:42:49] you
[1:42:50] we don't baptize you to be a member of
[1:42:52] the church that
[1:42:53] is
[1:42:54] working when you receive the holocaust
[1:42:58] you are baptized into the body of jesus
[1:43:02] christ is worldwide
[1:43:04] why is christopher what you didn't see
[1:43:06] or not is that right
[1:43:07] it's a worldwide body
[1:43:15] so i cannot be able to say that if you
[1:43:16] don't come to my church you are going to
[1:43:18] hell that is
[1:43:34] but there is one thing that will take
[1:43:36] people to heaven
[1:43:38] that is the word of god
[1:43:42] we need to separate
[1:43:45] the churches and denominations on the
[1:43:46] system
[1:43:50] your
[1:43:58] what will set us free is the truth and
[1:44:00] you could say that you shall know the
[1:44:03] truth
[1:44:12] have developed some kind of issue within
[1:44:14] themselves but you know the women call
[1:44:16] them they kind of figure because we are
[1:44:19] the believers of the message
[1:44:24] in our confines
[1:44:29] that is the deception
[1:44:31] they are making and forming themselves a
[1:44:34] religion within the message
[1:44:37] but let me tell you the message is not a
[1:44:40] religion
[1:44:43] there are many people that come to our
[1:44:45] message chat and will never make it to
[1:44:47] the rapture
[1:44:52] there are many people who are preaching
[1:44:54] this message and they themselves will
[1:44:56] not go in the rapture
[1:45:14] we have to become the members of the
[1:45:16] body of christ
[1:45:19] [Music]
[1:45:21] and that begins by the belief of the
[1:45:23] truth
[1:45:26] and by the receiving of the holy ghost
[1:46:25] god is not respect of persons
[1:46:29] hallelujah amen god looks at all of us
[1:46:35] in the same way
[1:46:37] and he has one measurement
[1:47:20] are making their churches as though it
[1:47:23] is the one that giving is giving them
[1:47:24] the certificate to the rapture but
[1:47:26] foreign
[1:48:07] so are you a member
[1:48:09] of an organization or you are a member
[1:48:12] of the body oh remember watching
[1:48:14] or remember
[1:48:16] sometimes i wonder what building the
[1:48:18] body or whether we are building our
[1:48:20] organizations
[1:48:24] so church we are building a body
[1:48:25] canister
[1:48:27] mobility not organization
[1:48:30] organizations will take people to hell
[1:48:35] if they are deceived
[1:48:37] but there is a group of people called
[1:48:38] the island why would i want to wait
[1:48:42] about the organization
[1:48:44] we
[1:49:23] but of course that first church the
[1:49:25] first fine body will always try to
[1:49:28] assert the position of the true church
[1:49:31] and contend that she another elect are
[1:49:34] they real and authentic
[1:49:40] with your
[1:50:19] you know it used to be many people when
[1:50:21] they come to the message
[1:50:24] for me
[1:50:27] they thought oh we are going to a
[1:50:29] perfect group of people
[1:50:34] oh we are going to a perfect church okay
[1:52:54] because god has told us
[1:53:24] i want to show you a few slightly and
[1:53:26] brother uh brother isaac if you can put
[1:53:27] it open but i'm having projected for us
[1:53:29] on the screen
[1:53:34] the trail of saturn and getting saturn
[1:53:36] through the edges engaged
[1:53:46] all right i want you to look at uh
[1:53:50] let me get it here
[1:53:52] okay
[1:53:57] you will need to touch up this project
[1:53:58] about a little bit so that the black can
[1:54:00] get out
[1:54:01] but the people will see
[1:54:04] what i'm trying to show
[1:54:06] the little
[1:54:11] okay just give me the next line
[1:54:17] okay
[1:54:18] so i wanted to look at i don't know
[1:54:20] whether it would be very clear for you
[1:54:21] but give me the next statement either
[1:54:24] all right uh i think
[1:54:25] it's clear for you to see though
[1:54:28] so the four horse riders are revelation
[1:54:30] six
[1:54:48] rider
[1:54:52] was
[1:54:53] actually the therefore yeah
[1:54:57] now i know denominations think it was
[1:54:59] christ
[1:55:02] because
[1:55:29] [Music]
[1:55:34] [Music]
[1:55:45] are you the one going to crown here
[1:55:46] again
[1:55:49] and i said
[1:55:50] that preacher had no revelation
[1:55:54] the bride oh my god he's actually going
[1:55:57] to ground him okay
[1:55:59] to take it
[1:56:01] yes sir i mean he has no crowns now yes
[1:56:03] you can
[1:56:04] go the bible later oh hallelujah i love
[1:56:07] the word
[1:56:09] speaks of christ
[1:56:11] after the tribulation
[1:56:38] and where we shall we be going
[1:57:47] but then that's not even the the one
[1:57:50] that really passes
[1:58:05] if you find someone guiding somewhere
[1:58:10] with no arrows
[1:58:16] would you fear to go there oh
[1:58:45] it's not about you coming to a message
[1:59:27] he's going to conquer the whole world
[1:59:48] but listen to me
[1:59:50] he is not faith christ see a preacher
[1:59:53] only but he is christ whoever that
[1:59:56] christian i mean i
[2:00:25] he can manifest the miracles
[2:00:29] but not the words
[2:00:34] listen to me don't put it is it
[2:00:36] the bible says bibliogram with all lying
[2:00:51] to do miracles and signs and wonders
[2:01:16] [Music]
[2:01:22] but here i'm giving you a mystery in my
[2:01:24] way chairman
[2:01:26] he is a deceiver murima he's claiming to
[2:01:29] be the right one again
[2:01:30] but he's a deceiver
[2:01:32] not because there is no abundance of
[2:01:34] miracles
[2:01:37] and wonders
[2:01:38] but because there is no true word of god
[2:01:46] let me ask you a question
[2:01:48] you know the biggest denominational
[2:01:50] church in the world
[2:01:57] i will tell you
[2:01:59] that church
[2:02:01] is the same church that prays
[2:02:15] that claims their leader
[2:02:29] and even the leader of the free world
[2:02:31] noble korean business
[2:02:35] goes and prostrates beforehand again
[2:02:40] he is recognized
[2:02:43] by all around
[2:02:58] you will find
[2:03:01] [Music]
[2:03:23] but it is supposed to be the church of
[2:03:25] christ
[2:03:40] i am the real catholic
[2:03:42] catholic
[2:03:43] you the elect of god
[2:03:45] i don't know
[2:03:46] you are the real catholic catholic
[2:03:49] church
[2:03:50] we are the church of christ
[2:03:53] in every nation
[2:04:07] to be the real one
[2:04:10] and the proof they have
[2:04:12] foreign
[2:04:50] was the same one the devil yeah you
[2:04:53] mushy turn changing colors now choose
[2:04:56] his challenge when he realized that he's
[2:04:57] the one who he is trying to deceive
[2:04:59] cannot be deceived
[2:05:04] so let me kill them now come on come
[2:05:05] back so he came
[2:05:08] through
[2:05:09] i will show you the next slides he came
[2:05:11] in the next
[2:05:12] following church agents yesterday
[2:06:11] is

[2:07:03] he now came in
[2:07:06] as uh
[2:07:07] a black horse right now

[2:07:38] because they did it in latin
[2:07:41] for themselves and also the latin was
[2:07:42] also not perfect
[2:07:50] but then we find that a man came like
[2:07:53] william chinder what a second about

[2:10:26] some of you even reading the bible in
[2:10:28] your home is something of the past
[2:10:34] tv and movies have replaced the reading
[2:10:37] of the word

[2:12:05] calling of a pastor
[2:12:09] don't marry

[2:15:07] anywhere oh my you cannot deceive this
[2:15:12] you wanted to suffocate them with famine
[2:15:16] but they realized
[2:15:18] i can't suffocate them with feminine
[2:15:19] teachers
[2:15:33] [Music]
[2:16:04] hallelujah amen and this man went from
[2:16:07] place to place from a certain attempt
[2:16:11] all over germany germany or now all over
[2:16:14] england england

[2:19:03] financially fusing yeah
[2:19:18] i don't have time to go through it all
[2:19:20] but seeing about the beat ambient the
[2:19:22] seven seals everybody's gonna have a
[2:19:25] timeline by the banh wood
[2:19:27] and uh we noticed that the first seal
[2:19:30] which is what we read today and boom
[2:19:32] based okay
[2:20:02] the spirit of god always raises the
[2:20:04] standards
[2:20:06] again is the devil open understand right
[2:20:09] amen
[2:20:11] and so in the first
[2:20:13] first ages

[2:20:43] symbolize emperor
[2:20:45] we see that that lion was symbolizing
[2:20:47] the boldness of preaching and follow

[2:21:00] to your students
[2:21:01] though we are an angel from heaven
[2:21:03] preach any other gospel unto you than
[2:21:05] that which we have preached unto you let
[2:21:07] him be your cast
[2:21:21] and we know apostle paul was the one who
[2:21:23] started the church at ephesus
[2:21:38] it was paul
[2:21:40] who taught against women preachers
[2:21:45] it was poor very powerful who said women
[2:21:47] should not cut their hair
[2:21:49] back
[2:21:51] because it is
[2:23:03] all right i mean
[2:23:05] and then when god revealed something to
[2:23:07] another caton
[2:23:11] maybe to interpret that time oh my
[2:23:13] goodness
[2:23:14] let this one also all this

[2:42:10] and then you know when they're speaking
[2:42:11] to someone
[2:42:12] someone can't see it
