[4:27] heard the voice of the lord god walking
[4:29] in the garden in the cool of the day and
[4:31] adam and his wife heed themselves from
[4:34] the presence of the lord god among us
[4:36] the trees of the garden
[4:55] and the lord god called adam and said
[4:56] unto him
[5:05] lord jesus may you give us inspiration

[11:19] your father
[11:23] there is a gene in you why do you win
[11:25] secret movie that only constrains
[12:20] according to those
[12:23] you characteristics
[12:23] them that is
[12:25] it may take centuries
