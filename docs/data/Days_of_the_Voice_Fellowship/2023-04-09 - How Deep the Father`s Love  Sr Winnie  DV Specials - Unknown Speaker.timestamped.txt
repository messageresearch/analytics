[0:00] keep the Father's Love For Us
[0:06] to be on domination
[0:11] that he should give his only son
[0:16] to me
[0:19] courageous treasure
[0:23] how great the pain of searing glows
[0:29] the father turns his face away
[0:35] as wounds which mother chosen ones
[0:41] bring me Nissans to Glory behold
[0:50] [Music]
[0:53] my sins a pony shoulders
[1:05] [Music]
[1:11] it was my sins that held him down
[1:17] until
[1:23] he's dying breath has brought me
[1:29] [Music]
[1:31] but it is
[1:42] [Music]
[1:50] Jesus Christ
[1:52] [Music]
[1:58] why should I gain from his reward
[2:10] but this I know with oh my God
[2:15] he's a woman I've paid in my right
[2:20] wrestle
[2:22] how great the love that God did span
[2:28] to come where I live
[2:34] fruit yes I see is outstretched hands
[2:39] as he declares me beautifully
[2:45] how great a love that sold me out
[2:51] how we find
[2:55] [Music]
[2:57] Mercy blood has washed my every part
[3:02] [Music]
[3:04] patches
[3:05] [Music]
[3:20] these Father's Love will go with me
[3:24] until
[3:27] the work is feeling
[3:31] snails
[3:39] my sheep break
[3:43] forward
[3:48] [Music]
[3:50] enough glories
[3:53] waiting
[3:55] I will not read the tempt us
[4:00] no fear to face my sheep break
[4:06] forward
[4:11] [Music]
[4:13] no glories waiting
[4:17] snails
[4:21] [Music]
[4:25] my sheep break
[4:29] forward
[4:34] [Music]
[4:35] of glories waiting
[4:39] [Music]
