the word i believe the lord has something for us [Music] let us sing the chorus of only belief as you are welcoming the word the prophet used to call it the angel song each time they sang it god moved and we are the carriers of this message so let us sing that song will come in the world with our hands lifted up oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] all [Music] oh [Music] [Music] he [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] lord jesus we believe we're coming yesterday that's the reason we have come into your house today yes because [Music] aside and every chapter which take up a bite we ask that you will come let's have a change and speak to us tonight are you getting to give all our hearts to you jesus [Music] going to read from [Music] the book of revelation chapter 19. 7 of revelation 19. let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is calm and his wife has made herself ready to was granted that she should be arrayed in the in fine linen clean and white for the final name is the righteousness of the saints about i want to take this uh opportunity to greet you in jesus name and so i'm continuing with um a woman of virtue that i spoke on on sunday amen amina how many were blessed on sunday sunday praise the lord coming that's the way i'm glad that i'm a woman of virtue and they sent me for command and democracy and uh on sunday everybody was a woman spiritually speaking we are all the bride of jesus christ when the bible says for the marriage of the lamb is come everywhere talking about the marriage of jesus christ christian but you see jesus christ is only the male but there is also a part which is the female yes that female part is you know just like we say and we have believed that jesus is the chief he's the head of the church to come and he took his aunties called jesus the head of the church bible yesterday [Music] is the one who leads and guides us and is the one who marries us and we are the body category just like the wife is subject to the word to the husband the church also must be subject to christ and uh just like in a family like the bible says that the man is the head of the wife the church no longer wants the headship of christ like the scripture also says that you see in the end time that women will want to heap themselves upon a man we don't really want anything from you neither to religion we don't want you to take care of us never want that we have everything we need to attack you we have our own house we have our own [Music] [Applause] to its core you see when you call me protestant it means i'm supposed to be protesting the wrong teachings and you know but they instead do not protest the wrong teachings but they protest the world they are called pentecostals they are supposed to be following the bible they have taken god they have to handle the word but in unrighteousness they have worshipped the creature more than the creators you see also the scripture says that they have taken the form of god in each fight and check out what they have denied the power they are wrong let me tell you church never come to that place where you have a form of god in its financial criticism of the world let me tell you what the power is [Music] but you see when you come to [Music] [Applause] is they [Music] it means you cannot change your situation are you hallelujah amen many people in this generation they have loved god because of something they have a form of god because of money because of healing because they want a miracle really they do not have interest when you hear the word of god [Music] from when we and it makes where do you find that in the but like i said you know they you know make up and then you know dress like man let me tell you something about our generation the women started by dressing like man to change their orientation they shoot them with hormones sexual orientation but [Music] it that way at least in our country they will say you as being segregated but if you you you go in this some of these developed countries and you say that a woman is not a man no government and a man is not a woman no more psychiatrists i will also say you are a bigot or something you see you you're not being considerate you are giving head speech [Applause] one of the justices of the of the supreme court that they were trying to interview what was the best [Music] you know my one of the uh lawmakers asked him this is the question that even my four year can so you don't know who a woman is that's thomas yeah and you are apparently supposed to be a woman and i will take it and you want to be the one to judge that you cannot even charge the very smallest things that god made the man in his image and then he took a rib out of his name and out of that he made a woman a woman adam is the one who called her a woman there there's nothing i have wrong about that woman i am saying this to you this is the reflection of our generation the mind of the people they know whether or not i've been slowly slowly going away from god see that damn problem and we've come to a place because what do we want to say when they cannot actually recognize who they are and that's the same spirit oh come on they could wear our trousers and still be a christian christian of god church for years and years because they were always religious and christians but they were never really changed god is going to marry a woman of virtue he says his wife has made herself ready his wife reads herself by the word oh [Music] and i will just talk about her but let me read the quote as i talk about it from the message the prophet says now here she had to take on the disgraceful part should path to lay down be called anything she wanted he and she was following exactly the rules that was laid down to her you know this the book of esther is a very wonderful book of study i don't think i need to go back to the story because i know that this is uh most of you because they had left their first estate they had left bethlehem and gone to uh more than the uh the land of more mirage and so that is where the boys of eddie mentioned now my were that's also a good story to show you brother my sister my brother your marriage can never prosper if it is out of the world your relationship with your wife cannot see the light of day if there is no christ in the middle of your name [Applause] even if god gives me a child now that's on the neighbor and poor man would you wait for that little boy to grow and then he marries you surely there is no hope don't worry even to be honest things have gone by zach go back to go back your people yeah yeah thank you you know those days when the pastor comes and the word you know it's like as if it is chasing you away from the church where everybody wronged as we need to make a choice is because of my sons was actually not telling them how to be keepers at home [Music] she was telling them i don't need you anymore you don't need to be keepers let us look at these things to be a kind in a realistic way let us not be spiritual for a moment forever yes i love you but surely even if you are to have a boy now i can't help but remember the day that jesus met his disciples they asked them do you also want to go but they let me tell you the only reason why we are following this message is because of the word of eternal life [Applause] your eyes on the price a month to go i didn't believe this message because of my wife all because of the husband that kid is but because of eternal life but whether you are sick yes [Music] the bible says he that finds himself will lose him but he that loses himself all these things are in the scriptures what the word calls foolishness change of sickness god called wisdom am i preaching to someone hallelujah amen and so ruth lucy followed her now go she told noah you're gonna know me i don't care see fine what my people will think of me what how others will sleep take me let me tell you when you receive that revelation could be pretty wrong because there is a higher goal of your tribe and the god of your nature my back is it was a secret nearly chance because this was a part of the of the culture of the tribe of israel there was a lot of redemption [Music] hallelujah is the roots right there my enemy i think we shall glean here no one wants to know and you know what he was just a rich man but and [Music] was [Music] but anyways i'm not talking about that today i wanted to look at this this woman oh my name tells ruth yeah ruth lucy i want to play hallelujah and she was following exactly the rules that was laid down to her yeah every move so she goes down and covers herself again when i swear to be getting elizabeth can you imagine how she she went and this man is sleeping and she goes on the feet and pulls the blankets and [Music] to the top where did she go to the tomb where did she go what yeah she was resting and by the bottom says that's where i found
