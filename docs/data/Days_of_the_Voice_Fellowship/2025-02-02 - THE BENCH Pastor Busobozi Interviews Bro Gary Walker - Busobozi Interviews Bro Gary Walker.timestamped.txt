[0:28] h for
[1:23] well greetings to you our viewers we are
[1:25] so happy to be back again with you here
[1:28] at the bench uh uh many years ago God
[1:32] gave me the grace of meeting with a man
[1:35] of God a precious Brother Gary Walker in
[1:38] Ethiopia at the time I was a pastor
[1:41] there with my wife and U God gave us the
[1:44] opportunity to meet with them and since
[1:48] then uh We've get we've got to know him
[1:51] and we are so blessed today to host him
[1:53] here at the bench Brother Gary Walker is
[1:56] a brother of course in Christ is a
[1:58] father to several children he will tell
[2:01] us how many and he's a grandfather as
[2:03] well of several children and he's a
[2:05] pastor of Living Word Tabernacle in
[2:07] brisban
[2:08] Australia uh join me today to welcome
[2:11] him and uh I think we'll just start
[2:13] right away and I have you brother Gary
[2:16] greet the people you welcome to the
[2:18] bench with pastori we've been doing this
[2:21] for quite a while now and I think this
[2:23] is the seventh episode okay would you
[2:25] please uh greet the people well God
[2:27] bless you uh it's a privilege to be here
[2:29] with the buzz greetings from Australia
[2:32] and uh we're this is very new to me so
[2:35] we're uh we're looking forward to see
[2:36] how this goes amen well we believe it
[2:39] will go very well uh we just feel
[2:42] relaxed we just want to have a little
[2:44] conversation um and just around the word
[2:47] and share the grace and the uh you know
[2:50] your life testimony is very touching to
[2:52] me and I believe it will be very
[2:54] touching and a blessing to uh many of
[2:56] our generation I told Brother Gary that
[2:59] we we do this bench because I feel that
[3:02] there is a lot that God has done in the
[3:04] past in the years past among these
[3:07] brothers that really have had a real
[3:09] walk with the Lord and many of our
[3:12] younger generation have missed out
[3:13] because not many have got an opportunity
[3:15] to hear or to know what God has done in
[3:16] the past but if we can be able to know
[3:19] what God has done in the past then we
[3:21] can be able to know and understand what
[3:24] God is doing in our time because Jesus
[3:26] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[3:29] forever
[3:30] so um I think I'd like us to just maybe
[3:34] for the people to get to know a little
[3:35] bit about you um this message that we
[3:39] preach that God sent a prophet in our
[3:41] generation to restore our faith back to
[3:43] the faith of the apostolic fathers how
[3:46] did you come to this message I think
[3:48] that's a good place to start yeah that's
[3:50] a good question uh we were living in
[3:52] Western Australia at the time and my mom
[3:55] and dad uh got to know a brother who
[3:59] introduced a message to my my parents
[4:01] and uh my parents never really got along
[4:03] too well uh growing up there was always
[4:06] a little bit of friction in the family
[4:08] and uh my mom and dad uh got baptized in
[4:11] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ gave
[4:12] their hearts to the Lord they were
[4:13] Storch Catholics and I remember one day
[4:17] uh them coming home and the pope was no
[4:20] longer God he was now the devil which
[4:21] was amazing to us you know and uh were
[4:25] they Catholics they were Catholics stor
[4:27] Catholics yeah okay and uh I remember
[4:29] walking into the kitchen at home when I
[4:31] was a young fellow and uh seeing my mom
[4:35] and dad uh hugging each other and this
[4:37] this was new you know this is working
[4:40] for them so uh I didn't really know I
[4:43] didn't understand really what they had
[4:45] got themselves into but my brother came
[4:48] back and he was in the Army in Australia
[4:50] and he went along to church as well and
[4:52] he came back baptized as well then my
[4:54] younger brother went and he came back
[4:57] baptized and I thought they were all har
[4:59] Krush or uh some cult you know so they
[5:03] invited me to come and talk to this
[5:04] brother Steve
[5:06] Allison and I thought well I'll go
[5:08] rescue the family and so I went to
[5:11] Brother Steve's house and we were there
[5:13] at about 10:00 in the morning and 10:00
[5:15] in the evening I was in the water I
[5:17] surrendered my life Jesus Christ and I
[5:20] was baptized as well so uh that's that's
[5:22] how it all started uhuh and uh were you
[5:26] ministering were you into Ministry at
[5:27] the time or you just freshh no I was a
[5:30] worldly just an Angry Young Man uh this
[5:33] was all very new to me uh
[5:37] I just speaking to uh brother Steve
[5:40] Allison who introduced the message to me
[5:42] he had answers you know which was which
[5:44] was strange the Catholic priests didn't
[5:46] have answers and religious people didn't
[5:48] have a lot of answers and serpent seed
[5:51] really struck my heart this was just
[5:53] seemed to be common sense uh anointed
[5:56] ones at the end time and various
[5:58] different things that we spoke about
[5:59] just seemed it just resignated and uh
[6:03] what could I
[6:06] do it was amazing and and you just
[6:10] answered another question right there I
[6:11] was going to ask you what really struck
[6:12] you most that really made you to receive
[6:15] the revelation of this word yeah so I
[6:17] remember uh because we were dragged up
[6:19] Catholics the last time I went to uh the
[6:22] Catholic church I asked the priest if
[6:24] Adam and Eve were the only two people on
[6:26] Earth where does everybody come from and
[6:28] he said well you don't have to believe
[6:30] that story and and I thought well what
[6:33] do you believe you know and so that was
[6:35] the last time I went to church and I was
[6:37] about maybe 15 I suppose and I just
[6:40] wandered off into the world and I was
[6:41] just doing very worldly things at that
[6:43] time and by the time I was about 20
[6:46] years old I think it was 1989 actually
[6:49] summer of
[6:50] 1989 that's where I seemed to stumble
[6:53] across the message but we know that it
[6:54] was predestination yes and uh that's
[6:57] where I I got the answers to the
[6:59] questions and uh what could you do when
[7:02] you're presented with the truth but just
[7:04] humble yourself to it and uh that's how
[7:07] it's up but but no I wasn't a preacher
[7:08] or anything like that and that's 1999
[7:10] 19889 89 sorry yeah uh so uh you of
[7:15] course speaking to you I I learned that
[7:17] uh you are an originally an African yes
[7:21] I was born in South Africa so where
[7:23] we're brothers yeah amen I just thought
[7:26] I should say that being that you're in
[7:28] Africa I mean you would feel very happy
[7:29] to know that you are African yeah yeah
[7:32] I'm so glad so you you live South Africa
[7:35] not in the Catholic church at the time
[7:37] oh yes yes my mom and died were
[7:39] Catholics yeah from the beginning yeah
[7:40] from the beginning so in 1989 the light
[7:44] uh strikes your heart and then you get
[7:46] to know the revelation of this message
[7:48] and so um how then did you um get into
[7:52] the ministry well uh there was the last
[7:55] thing I was looking for um the absolute
[7:58] last thing I was looking for but uh one
[8:01] day I remember I sister Deborah was my
[8:05] my wife she since passed away but I
[8:07] remember she was fixing her hair in the
[8:09] mirror as as the sisters do and I walked
[8:12] behind her and it was that point the
[8:14] Lord called me to the ministry I don't I
[8:17] can't give you an accurate description
[8:20] of what took place but right there at
[8:22] that very instant I knew that God had
[8:23] called me to the ministry and my heart
[8:26] broke and uh because that's not what I
[8:28] wanted I wasn't a public person I wasn't
[8:30] a public speaker I was quite shy I
[8:32] didn't like crowds but I knew that God
[8:35] had called me to the ministry and I
[8:37] collapsed back onto the bed and Deborah
[8:40] this my wife said to me what what what's
[8:42] wrong and I said to I remember saying to
[8:44] her uh the Lord just called me to the
[8:47] ministry and she laughed and I really I
[8:50] don't blame her because she knew my
[8:51] background and uh my my personality type
[8:55] you know and it I just seemed to be the
[8:57] last person that you would pick to to be
[8:59] a public speaker M and I was very
[9:01] disappointed with the Lord I really was
[9:05] uh I thought the Lord had made a mistake
[9:08] I remember honestly I remember I said to
[9:10] the Lord I said this is must be your
[9:11] first mistake yeah uh I won't tell
[9:13] anybody you won't tell anybody nobody
[9:15] will find out and we'll leave it at that
[9:18] but it just uh things evolved now uh
[9:21] being that we are addressing a younger
[9:24] like I said I keep saying that younger
[9:27] generation there are two pertinent
[9:28] questions that I would like to put to
[9:30] you
[9:34] one and while you tell us your life
[9:37] story and you know what you have gone
[9:40] through this is not something you're
[9:41] preaching because you
[9:43] see uh young people here preachers they
[9:45] get to hear preachers and they hear
[9:47] someone after someone and sometimes it
[9:49] doesn't really make sense to them in a
[9:51] way that of relating directly to them
[9:54] and in understanding that this is
[9:56] someone's life is really telling this
[9:58] life but what this bench does is you get
[10:01] to speak you get to speak to us by your
[10:04] life and so um talking about Ministry
[10:08] and we get to the one of marriage
[10:09] afterward talking about Ministry because
[10:12] there are very many even now listening
[10:14] to you wondering how do I know that the
[10:16] has called me Min and then how do I get
[10:20] respond to that so what was it that
[10:23] actually happened to you at that moment
[10:27] that press your but the know that's very
[10:33] good question and I would have to say
[10:35] that it's Case by
[10:44] Cas so I don't think there's a rule of
[10:47] thumb or a measuring stick that we can
[10:50] use
[10:52] uh if you have a if you have a personal
[10:58] relationship with Jesus Christ uh I
[11:01] would suggest to you because it's not an
[11:03] absolute because like I say everybody's
[11:05] different uh it will be uncomfortable it
[11:09] will be confusing uh and don't think
[11:12] that you're alone and don't think it's
[11:13] strange it's just that being called to
[11:17] the ministry is a very Supernatural
[11:18] thing it it it would be nice if the Lord
[11:20] would send you a text first to prepare
[11:22] you or uh but you know it's just an
[11:25] uncomfortable place to be in fact it's
[11:27] quite a horrifying place to be because
[11:30] normally God uses uh people that are the
[11:32] least equipped for the job amen so don't
[11:36] feel that there's some magic measuring
[11:38] Rod or that there's some formula or some
[11:41] silver bullet um you just have to relax
[11:45] and just go with the flow and right
[11:48] there you say that uh you felt that God
[11:51] had made a very big mistake I knew it
[11:54] yes it's not something you thought you
[11:56] really knew it it appears that every man
[11:59] that God calls into the life of service
[12:02] actually thinks that God has made a
[12:03] mistake Moses did Paul did brother bham
[12:06] did and what is this that made you feel
[12:10] well we know what made brother bam feel
[12:12] that way brother Paul and you know Moses
[12:15] what is it that made you feel that you
[12:17] were not the right Peak okay that's a
[12:20] good question as well brother buz uh
[12:22] when I was too shy to get up in church
[12:25] just to give a
[12:26] testimony just to give a testimony just
[12:28] to give a testimony I wouldn't do it uh
[12:31] I didn't like crowds I was quite a
[12:33] backward person I was a loner uh it's
[12:37] just just I'm amazed that the Lord
[12:40] picked me so are you saying Brother Gary
[12:42] are you trying to suggest to us today
[12:44] that God can actually call a shy person
[12:46] into the absolutely and he use them
[12:48] absolutely amazing and so well you
[12:52] mentioned uh earlier about sister
[12:55] Deborah and and when it Dawn on you that
[12:58] God had called you to the ministry you
[12:59] were with her and you told her she left
[13:01] well God gave me the opportunity to meet
[13:03] her then I do not remember the year but
[13:06] about seven or eight years ago when you
[13:07] came to Ethiopia and with her and I was
[13:11] able to interact with her and talk a
[13:13] little bit I found that she was a true
[13:15] Christian and so how then did you get to
[13:19] know her in the very beginning were you
[13:21] in the message then or were you not yet
[13:23] in the message no uh so like I said I
[13:25] gave my heart to the Lord in about
[13:27] 1989 yes I went to church and that's
[13:30] where I met sister Deborah and I
[13:32] remember uh the first time we met uh I I
[13:36] CU I was I was the type of uh guy that
[13:41] would go sit at the back you know that
[13:44] type of a guy I didn't want to be
[13:45] sitting at the front I didn't want to be
[13:46] seen I just want to be leave me alone I
[13:48] just want to do my thing and I remember
[13:50] walking past sister Deborah and there
[13:52] was an empty seat next to her and she
[13:53] had her Bible like this and she saw me
[13:56] coming with my my leather jack cuz we
[13:58] used to ride bikes
[13:59] my leather jacket and my boots and uh
[14:01] she got her Bible and put her Bible on
[14:03] the seat next to
[14:06] her and uh I thought to myself don't
[14:09] worry girl I'm not sitting there and
[14:11] that was the first time we met yeah it
[14:12] was in church yeah and then quickly uh
[14:15] things changed and uh things things
[14:18] changed and we were married uh December
[14:20] 1991 praise the Lord did this track you
[14:23] right there at that moment no came much
[14:26] later yeah now uh there's something else
[14:29] this might look a little silly but um uh
[14:33] being in the mission field especially in
[14:35] my country I've seen this kind has been
[14:38] quite a
[14:38] thing um you say that you were seated
[14:41] almost next to her and all that uh is is
[14:46] that um sitting like the sitting
[14:49] arrangement in the church because I I I
[14:52] know Muslims women sit on one side and
[14:55] Men sit on on the other yeah uh what do
[14:59] you say about that uh it's all about
[15:01] modesty um I've been to churches where
[15:04] they have the brothers on one side like
[15:06] Eastern Eastern Europe yeah uh some
[15:08] Churches even in Africa uh I do not know
[15:11] that in Europe it's that way I've seen
[15:12] it here in some Churches not not not
[15:14] every not not all but every church is
[15:16] Sovereign yeah and it's only an issue if
[15:19] you want it to be an issue yeah uh we
[15:21] come to church to hear the word you know
[15:23] and if people are comfortable with men
[15:25] on one side and women on the other side
[15:27] it's not a problem but uh
[15:29] uh so yeah every church is Sovereign and
[15:31] every church has a right to worship God
[15:34] the way the way they want yeah yeah so
[15:36] really it's not a shame it's not it's
[15:39] not a Doctrine exactly so now uh you
[15:42] mentioned about how you met then you
[15:45] eventually got married and I'm sorry to
[15:48] you know keep going back to that you're
[15:49] dealing with the younger people here how
[15:52] would a young man know that she is
[15:55] absolutely the right one mhm
[15:59] okay Case by case remember yeah I
[16:02] remember uh for myself so I'm speaking
[16:05] for myself the Lord told me uh and when
[16:09] the Lord speaks to you it's not
[16:10] necessarily words uh even brother Bram
[16:12] said it could be Impressions it was
[16:13] probably going to be Impressions So when
[16:15] you say the Lord spoke to me uh I said
[16:18] the Lord impressed upon me that sister
[16:19] Deborah was the one for me I cannot say
[16:22] I was madly in love with her and I
[16:24] cannot say that she was madly in love
[16:26] with me and I would uh strong suggest to
[16:29] you uh don't marry for love yeah because
[16:33] when Love Runs Out what are you going to
[16:35] do if you marry by Revelation When the
[16:37] Love Runs Out uh then instead of falling
[16:41] back on commitment you can fall back on
[16:43] on the Lord's plan exactly yeah so uh if
[16:46] you are born again you must be born
[16:48] again before you uh before you get
[16:50] married yes because if you're born again
[16:52] you have agape love yes now if you're
[16:54] married just with fio love when fio Love
[16:58] Runs Out you have to fall back on
[16:59] commitment yeah gape love never runs out
[17:03] yeah so so so I can say I can say I was
[17:06] happily married for 29 years yes we
[17:08] never had an argument praise the lord we
[17:11] we disagreed because we're human beings
[17:13] yes uh but we never had a screaming
[17:15] match we never had uh something that the
[17:17] neighbors could hear uh you must be born
[17:20] again before you get married just make
[17:22] sure you're born again and don't marry
[17:23] for love yeah yeah yeah marry by
[17:27] Revelation you of course of course
[17:30] you'll be in love yes you're be in love
[17:31] but don't but don't do it just for that
[17:33] because love will run out you know
[17:35] Pastor Gary have found that what many
[17:37] young people call love is actually just
[17:40] I don't know if I would be right to say
[17:42] last last fulfilling which can quickly
[17:45] wear off and but you see love covers a
[17:48] multitude of sins not not feel love not
[17:51] feel love perfect love yes God is own
[17:53] love and and you know um so they need to
[17:57] have agap love God is own
[17:59] love you know you what's the difference
[18:01] you know brother Buzz uh
[18:04] Jesus was with Judas for three and a
[18:08] half years and never
[18:12] fuss if love can tame a wolf what about
[18:15] a wife or a
[18:17] husband yeah so if you are truly born
[18:20] again with a gap love with the love of
[18:21] God I'm talking about Corinthians 13
[18:23] love which is not easily offended yes if
[18:26] you have that in your heart you are able
[18:29] to step back and humble yourself rather
[18:31] than feeding your own ego that makes the
[18:34] marriage
[18:35] work uh many things are going through my
[18:37] head right now I don't know which
[18:38] direction we should take but I'll just
[18:40] be led by the holy spirit because you
[18:42] see talking about that this is really
[18:43] helping many talking about that because
[18:46] we've had an issue uh with the basis of
[18:49] marriage and many think or say it is
[18:52] love love love love but just say love
[18:54] blindly without exactly knowing what
[18:55] kind of love we talking about but you
[18:57] brought in something there where you
[18:59] said uh if someone is not born again
[19:03] they cannot have that agap love so
[19:07] should we then encourage young people
[19:09] not even to enter into marriage
[19:11] relationships until they're born again
[19:14] absolutely
[19:16] absolutely yeah that like there's no
[19:18] long answer to that it's just yes amen
[19:21] yeah so you heard it right there young
[19:24] person if you are not born again do not
[19:28] start relationship because you're
[19:30] starting the relationship on the wrong
[19:32] basis and then you eventually find out
[19:34] later on it doesn't actually work the
[19:37] man yep because if if you get married
[19:39] say if the brother gets married because
[19:42] uh the sister has a lovely figure what
[19:45] happens when the lovely figure is no
[19:46] longer no longer a lovely figure if uh
[19:50] if he uh brought you chocolate and Roses
[19:54] uh he better make sure the chocolate and
[19:56] the Roses keep coming and keep coming
[19:57] and keep coming
[19:59] uh the moment they stop the love stop
[20:01] yeah that's
[20:04] right that's a good one right that you
[20:06] want to add something on
[20:07] that I'll get myself in
[20:10] trouble well what I can say on this in
[20:13] on this bench interview do not hold
[20:15] yourself Pastor Gary there's quite a lot
[20:17] in you I must warn you young people
[20:18] Brother Gary is a a teacher of the word
[20:21] and he has not told me that I I could
[20:23] tell that by are sitting under his
[20:25] ministry for these past several days we
[20:27] have had him in the country
[20:29] and just uh sit your tie your seat belt
[20:32] and and get ready for what the Lord has
[20:34] for you on this bench interview this is
[20:36] one of the kind I believe we will have
[20:39] or will have we have ever had now uh I
[20:42] think it's the right basis to get into
[20:44] your testimony right there when you
[20:46] talked about your wife and how you had
[20:50] you've never had you never had an
[20:52] argument for the 29 years you were
[20:54] married that's right and I could tell
[20:56] because I have a book in my hands
[20:59] uh and the title is three times
[21:03] dead but still alive three times dead
[21:06] but still alive brothers and sisters we
[21:09] are seated on the bench today with a man
[21:12] who died three times but still alive and
[21:15] this book was written by none
[21:17] other than but by the woman that he
[21:20] loved and married and became the mother
[21:21] of his children and a grandmother of his
[21:23] children and um I've not read it all
[21:27] because I we had very short of a time
[21:30] I've I've listened to your testimony on
[21:31] video but I've not read this book before
[21:34] and now that I have it I've read a few
[21:36] chapters and part of what I read here is
[21:39] because this was written by
[21:40] her and and you know they had um and you
[21:44] will tell us the whole story but uh this
[21:47] is a story or a testimony of the power
[21:51] of God what God can do uh because we
[21:55] believe that Jesus Christ is the same
[21:56] yesterday today and forever but Gary all
[21:59] over the world has been known by this
[22:01] testimony mostly what God did for them
[22:04] what God did for him and his family and
[22:06] it's not been easy and today we want to
[22:08] sit back relax and hear it all if you
[22:10] can tell it all from the beginning to
[22:11] the end Brother Gary feel free to do
[22:13] that but you see they had they had a
[22:16] terrible accident and the the
[22:18] circumstances upon which they had the
[22:20] accident maybe he will tell that but
[22:22] there is this part that really moved me
[22:24] that the sister wrote in this book as
[22:27] she said I can only
[22:29] describe what happened and this is now
[22:32] in the in the during the the accident
[22:35] when they were having that accident
[22:37] because she was in the car with him and
[22:38] their daughter one of their daughters I
[22:40] can only describe what happened next as
[22:42] being a thought that spoke to me and
[22:44] said brother bham laid his hand on
[22:46] sister Meda because at that moment it
[22:49] appears that Brother Gary had already
[22:51] passed out or actually died so she says
[22:54] I tried to do this but my arm refused to
[22:56] move you remember how brother B in the
[22:58] accident you know tried to lay his hand
[23:01] upon his wife and you know she she came
[23:03] back to life and so she tried to also
[23:06] push her hand to lay it upon brother gar
[23:08] uh but she could not move the hand cuz
[23:11] she was also in pain and of course maybe
[23:12] the hand had an injury I do not know
[23:14] we'll hear more about that yeah and she
[23:17] says I I tried to reach over with my
[23:19] left hand but I couldn't reach I gained
[23:22] this thought said it doesn't matter I
[23:24] began to pray loudly with no hysteria or
[23:26] fear that life and healing would flow
[23:29] through Gary and you know I imagine what
[23:34] love what would be that that would cause
[23:38] her to do that in such a circumstance I
[23:41] believe it was the love of God I believe
[23:43] it was the same thing that moved by the
[23:44] bham it was more than a gift it was you
[23:46] know the love of God in his heart that
[23:48] prayed over brother uh sister Meda and
[23:51] you know she came back to life and the
[23:54] same thing happened here sister Deborah
[23:56] prayed you know out loud ly for Brother
[23:59] Gary and he came back to life I think
[24:01] this was the very first moment that you
[24:02] came back to life and maybe you can tell
[24:04] us what happened before this and then
[24:07] also the other three two times and maybe
[24:10] just speak and tell us your testimony
[24:11] whatever so uh uh so I'm married to this
[24:15] uh sister Deborah right uh we never had
[24:18] a contract uh of a marriage and I say a
[24:21] contract in that we weren't married uh
[24:24] 5050 you do your 50% I'll do my 50%
[24:27] that's a contract
[24:28] uh a a true marriage is 100% 100% uh you
[24:32] take a vow for better for worse um so
[24:36] you can uh you can pick up you can pick
[24:39] up where and sister de was a perfect
[24:41] example of that uh we we were driving
[24:45] home driving home from church actually
[24:47] i' I'd been preaching for a brother up
[24:49] north and um as we were as we were
[24:53] driving I looked behind me and I saw my
[24:55] daughter had taken the diagonal part of
[24:57] the seat Bel off and put behind her just
[24:59] still wearing the lap and I said to
[25:01] Hannah I said Hannah put the seat belt
[25:03] on properly and I remember watching her
[25:05] put the seat belt on properly and that's
[25:07] the last thing I
[25:09] remember uh what had happened was a
[25:12] truck had come around the corner a
[25:13] logging truck uh was overloaded going
[25:15] too fast and his back trailers rolled
[25:18] into our lane and we were doing 100 kilm
[25:20] an hour one way he was doing 110 the
[25:22] other and uh we we collided and uh my
[25:26] car rolled and rolled uh I've seen the
[25:29] police reports uh and I don't know if
[25:31] you seen a picture of the car it looks
[25:33] like a bomb's gone off yeah in inside it
[25:36] uh I was dead uh sister Deborah being a
[25:39] nurse she she recognized that her and
[25:41] Hannah started to pray fervently um uh I
[25:46] mentioned the seat belt because the only
[25:48] the only uh uh injury that my daughter
[25:52] sustained was the lap diagonal left a a
[25:55] bruise on her on her body it caught her
[25:58] and I just said put the thing on Prop
[26:00] you so I than the Lord
[26:05] you so we we uh we hit the
[26:09] truck I died the car was ack sister
[26:13] deborra receiv injuries de prayed
[26:16] somebody arrived first person on the
[26:18] scene was a paramedic the Lord's got
[26:21] everything under control and they put a
[26:24] uh a thing down my throat to keep the
[26:28] open um and by the ambulance had arrived
[26:32] I died again and the paramedics had
[26:35] written out on and I have the piece of
[26:37] paper at home at at 10 minutes to 5 uh
[26:41] in the afternoon I six and they put ACR
[26:56] myp Hospital bring me back so that was
[27:00] three times in one day I died yeah and
[27:04] uh so I I was left in a
[27:07] coma and the doctor's report to my wife
[27:09] which by the way sister de was an ex
[27:12] nurse the report to my wife was uh he's
[27:15] not going to make it he's going to he's
[27:16] going to die it's just it's just the
[27:18] injuries he sustained were too Grievous
[27:22] and uh when I didn't die they said to
[27:25] they said to my wife well it looks like
[27:27] he's going to live
[27:28] but he's going to be a vegetable he
[27:30] won't be able to think he won't be able
[27:32] to talk he won't be able to move he'll
[27:34] be sitting in a wheelchair for the rest
[27:35] of his life and that is the very best
[27:38] diagnosis we can give but as you can see
[27:41] the grace of God uh said something
[27:44] else and I see right here in the book uh
[27:48] it says later when going through a bag
[27:50] containing Gary's blooded clothes that
[27:52] had been cut off him and a few other
[27:55] items my sister found a piece of paper
[27:57] and on piece of paper was written these
[27:59] words Gary Walker
[28:02] 25969 that is his birthday 63 P drive
[28:06] that's the the address where they were
[28:07] living and uh 1646 1650 is this the time
[28:12] yes 1655 and then
[28:15] 1712 l meaning loss of consciousness
[28:19] 1748 deceased 1805 so they actually this
[28:24] is actually a medical report yes that
[28:28] had announced you deceased deceased what
[28:30] was cuz I mean like I've had this before
[28:34] but I've always waited to meet you so I
[28:35] can ask
[28:37] you what did the doctor explain after
[28:41] giving a report that you were deceased
[28:43] and it turned out that you came back to
[28:44] life like what did they say about that
[28:47] uh they say nothing that they're very
[28:48] careful uh they have to maintain a
[28:51] professional uh appearance and uh their
[28:55] reputation is at risk so they're very
[28:56] very careful like a good politician uh
[28:58] they can say a lot of stuff without
[29:00] saying stuff uh I asked the doctor after
[29:02] I'd come out of the coma and I because I
[29:05] spent nine months in a hospital I asked
[29:07] the doctor I said hey uh you've seen
[29:09] what happened and you know the all the
[29:11] diagnosis and you know I'm not supposed
[29:12] to be able to talk you know I'm
[29:14] paralyzed on the left hand side you you
[29:16] know all the diagnosis but now you see
[29:18] what you see I said to the doctor if you
[29:20] haven't got it in you to say the Lord
[29:22] Jesus Christ can't you at least admit
[29:25] intelligent design I tried to ran off as
[29:28] nicely as I could for him and he said no
[29:32] so they they yeah they didn't want to to
[29:34] say anything after that but you see I
[29:38] think that they also recognized the
[29:41] miracle some some did some did some did
[29:43] some yes some wouldn't some wouldn't but
[29:46] but anyways what God has done cannot be
[29:49] undone what God has has done I I mean um
[29:54] during that time I I wouldn't know I I
[29:57] don't know whether this is the right
[29:58] great question to ask
[29:59] but do you remember anything no no no I
[30:04] remember uh being in a coma and I could
[30:06] hear every now and again something I
[30:08] remember my daughter Hannah saying to
[30:10] the nurse why has the Machine gone to
[30:12] green and another voice said that's
[30:14] because your dad is breathing for
[30:16] himself and now remember the last thing
[30:18] I remember is driving my car and now I'm
[30:20] unable to move I'm unable to open my
[30:23] eyes uh I'm in a coma and I'm hearing
[30:26] somebody say that's because dad's
[30:28] breathing for himself now and I thought
[30:30] Lord what has gone
[30:33] on yeah so um when I came out of the
[30:37] coma I did not remember my wife I did
[30:40] not remember my children I didn't
[30:42] remember anything but I could remember
[30:45] the message of the hour my God because
[30:48] the message is in the
[30:50] subconscious my God the mind was so
[30:53] damaged they said I would be unable to
[30:55] think for the rest of my life that the
[30:57] head injury I sustained was so
[30:59] impressive that the every doctor said no
[31:02] he will not live so when I came out of
[31:04] the coma I couldn't remember anything I
[31:06] I just I had Amnesia but I could
[31:08] remember 1963 the cloud I could remember
[31:11] 1933 the pillar of fire I could remember
[31:13] the quotes I could remember the
[31:14] paragraph numbers I could remember I
[31:16] could remember because these things are
[31:18] in the
[31:19] subconscious
[31:21] yeah you know in thean church age uh
[31:25] brother banam says a few things about
[31:26] suffering
[31:28] and um uh there's even uh some kind of
[31:31] gospel uh these days well of course it's
[31:34] been a while among the Pentecostal group
[31:36] that if you are suffering it means that
[31:39] God is not with you and if everything is
[31:42] going well it means that uh you are
[31:45] blessed and God is with you uh I I
[31:49] believe that you are the best man that
[31:51] can talk about
[31:52] suffering um as much as brother bham
[31:55] says here and I I'll quote Maybe before
[31:58] you answer that he says for I Rec that I
[32:00] think it's a scripture that the
[32:01] sufferings of this present time are not
[32:03] worthy to be compared with the glory
[32:04] which shall be revealed in US unless we
[32:07] suffer with him we cannot reign with him
[32:11] you have to suffer to Reign the reason
[32:12] for this is that character simply is
[32:15] never made without suffering character
[32:17] is a victory not a gift a man without
[32:20] character can't reain because power
[32:23] apart from character is satanic but
[32:25] Power with character is fit to
[32:28] now I believe that you you attained a
[32:30] certain uh magnitude and level of
[32:33] character through these things that you
[32:34] suffered through the pain through all
[32:36] all of that what would you have to say
[32:38] about these things
[32:41] uh I can say I love you you can say you
[32:44] love me those are just words but love
[32:47] can only be proven in unlovable
[32:51] circumstances you can only prove your
[32:53] love to God when it seems like he's
[32:56] turned his back on you there's no that
[32:58] is pure worship when God has gone silent
[33:02] on you when life turns itself upside
[33:04] down when you feel like you're up
[33:06] against the wall and God has forgotten
[33:08] you because I was convinced that uh
[33:12] God's the Supreme anger of God and the
[33:14] Supreme perfect Judgment of God was upon
[33:17] me because of the pain that I was going
[33:19] through uh I I couldn't talk sometimes
[33:22] because of the pain if somebody walked
[33:23] past me and the hair on my feet move I
[33:26] would scream uh the pain was
[33:29] so well I just can't describe it but
[33:33] that was my opportunity to prove to God
[33:36] I love them if you look at a hill far
[33:39] away
[33:41] Calvary God proved his love to us the
[33:44] only way you can prove your love is in
[33:47] unlovable circumstances so if
[33:49] everything's going
[33:50] good okay but if everything's going bad
[33:53] and you still maintain your testimony
[33:55] and you still Worship the Lord okay now
[33:57] you prove something to the Lord and
[34:00] that's rich to God that's worth
[34:02] something to God if I had a computer and
[34:05] uh I programmed it to say I love
[34:08] you
[34:10] it's somebody uh who in their own free
[34:15] will says to me I love you in an
[34:18] unlovable circumstance it's worth
[34:21] something to me and if you can love God
[34:24] in unlovable circumstance that's rich to
[34:27] God
[34:29] and we cannot love God without loving
[34:32] our neighbor our brother and um you know
[34:35] many Believers think that uh they can
[34:38] love God but hate those who hate them
[34:41] well they Believers but as long as they
[34:43] hate them they don't like them very much
[34:44] they can also dislike them or Hur them
[34:47] um I believe you are the man that can
[34:49] answer that because you've gone through
[34:50] it those people just wear the veneer of
[34:53] religion uh faith is based on
[34:56] forgiveness that's what the prophet
[34:57] tells us
[34:58] uh if you have unforgiveness in your
[34:59] heart you are wasting time coming to
[35:01] church you are wasting your time you're
[35:03] wasting everybody's time wasting God's
[35:04] time uh if you have unforgiveness in
[35:07] your heart you cannot work with faith
[35:10] because faith is based on
[35:13] forgiveness God God is love I'd like you
[35:15] to teach us more about
[35:17] forgiveness people have come up to me
[35:19] and I've preached to someone here on
[35:20] forgiveness but you see people keep keep
[35:23] on asking Pastor how can I forgive
[35:25] someone who has done something tangible
[35:27] something that has ruined my life
[35:29] something that has how can I really take
[35:31] it in my heart to genuinely say I
[35:32] forgive them I can't I just can't do
[35:34] that how do you advise such a person be
[35:36] born
[35:39] again yep if you are born again so a lot
[35:42] of people we the veneer of religion they
[35:45] they they wear a mask of you know
[35:47] they're nice people when everything is
[35:49] nice but when everything is not nice
[35:51] they are not nice it's religion it's
[35:54] just religion uh there is a reality in
[35:57] the new birth that's what it's called
[35:59] the New and Living Way It Is it is real
[36:02] it changes your character three nurses
[36:05] came into my room when I was in the
[36:06] hospital and they said Mr Walker okay we
[36:09] want to know what is the difference and
[36:11] I said I said ladies what are you
[36:13] talking about and they said you have
[36:15] been in so much pain and you have never
[36:17] sworn you have never hit anybody you
[36:20] have always been a gentleman what's the
[36:22] difference and I thought here we go
[36:24] three baptisms coming up M and I said
[36:27] that's because I'm born again and that's
[36:29] where they didn't want to know about it
[36:30] but they could identify something
[36:33] different you know so if you can't
[36:35] forgive you have to get on your knees
[36:38] and ask for the reality of the Gospel uh
[36:41] if you have the spirit of Jesus Christ
[36:42] in you remember Jesus lived with the
[36:44] devil for three and a half years and
[36:46] never fast it's only an issue if you
[36:49] want to feed your
[36:52] ego you know when you spoke about that I
[36:55] I'm trying to uh locate the portion cuz
[36:58] I had not yet highlighted it where uh
[37:00] you know when the paramedics I think
[37:02] they were when they came to carry you
[37:05] carry you away and your wife shouted
[37:08] said okay said that you're going to get
[37:10] an ambulance she shouted no get get a
[37:12] helicopter because she had seen how you
[37:14] were and then you know she was praying
[37:17] the whole time and as she was praying
[37:19] this man came and I think was cursing or
[37:21] speaking some bad words um and she was
[37:24] in pain you know she could have said
[37:25] anything in that moment being a child of
[37:27] God but she shouted back God forgive you
[37:30] yeah yeah so I wasn't there obviously I
[37:33] was uh I was either dead or in a
[37:36] coma but um yeah she had broken her arm
[37:41] and I see I saw the x-rays the humorous
[37:45] was the broken in half and the ball the
[37:47] socket had turned upside down so the
[37:50] ball was down and a broken the spiky
[37:52] part was up in the
[37:53] socket the pain that that must have put
[37:56] sister DEA through
[37:58] and she was laying on the side of the
[38:00] road in that much pain praying for me
[38:03] yeah yeah I noticed that yeah and then
[38:05] the partic was an atheist and he said to
[38:07] her oh that's not going to do anything
[38:09] yeah and uh that's when she asked the
[38:11] Lord to forgive him yeah yeah that's
[38:14] called the real deal
[38:16] yeah the only way we can be able to test
[38:20] our faith that we really are believers
[38:23] is when we are in such
[38:24] circumstances and many Christians are
[38:26] good Christians in church as long as
[38:29] everything is going well but when things
[38:31] be go begin to go south then they forget
[38:33] that they Christians you have to suffer
[38:37] that's just pain and simple uh because
[38:40] character is a victory it's not a lot
[38:43] lot like you just wrot uh you just read
[38:46] out if you're are truly born again it's
[38:49] automatic all the Sheep knows is e grass
[38:52] and the wol will take care of itself so
[38:54] I'm not trying to be nice I'm not trying
[38:57] to be
[38:58] forgiving I'm not trying to be
[39:00] religious I
[39:03] am it takes care of itself you have an
[39:05] instinct and Things become what quite
[39:08] the Propet automatically so forgiving is
[39:10] not a struggle when you're born again no
[39:14] no so in fact brother B said if somebody
[39:17] has offended you and they are in the
[39:20] wrong definitely in the wrong and you
[39:22] know you're in the right you still have
[39:24] to take that person uh before the Lord
[39:27] presence of the Lord and brother
[39:29] brandham said it might be your attitude
[39:32] that determines that person's Eternal
[39:37] destination he said they're absolutely
[39:39] wrong you are absolutely right but it's
[39:42] your attitude towards them in prayer may
[39:45] determine their Eternal so God God is
[39:49] depending on us to get to God for them
[39:52] before God gets to them for us because
[39:55] God said vengeance is mine sayth the
[39:57] Lord
[39:58] so God God's got a mercy seat on the
[40:00] Earth today called the blood of Jesus
[40:02] Christ so God is God is depending on us
[40:05] to get to him and ask for their
[40:07] forgiveness before he gets to them for
[40:11] us yeah my man that that sounds uh
[40:15] speaks volumes and uh with many having a
[40:18] form of Christianity a form of religion
[40:21] but not have in the life exactly so I
[40:24] believe that every Christian um who
[40:26] finds very hard to forgive others has a
[40:29] problem in the area of the new would I
[40:31] be right if I absolutely
[40:34] yes no long answer yes yes period if you
[40:39] have the spirit of Jesus Christ I tell
[40:41] you on a hill far away there's your
[40:43] example he said father forgive me in all
[40:47] that pain all that suffering knowing he
[40:50] had not done one thing
[40:51] wrong he and in know it's the same thing
[40:54] that also Steven did when they were
[40:57] storing him yeah and you know you said
[40:59] something when we were in carja on that
[41:02] as you're preaching can you please say
[41:03] that again uh that when when Steven was
[41:06] so full of the Holy Ghost that when he
[41:08] was taking the hard blows he was being
[41:10] stoned he he looked up uh and he said I
[41:13] see the son of man standing the Bible
[41:16] says that when Jesus rose from the dead
[41:18] he ascended up on high and sat down on
[41:20] the right hand of majesty when Peter
[41:23] when Steven said father forgive them for
[41:26] being stoned he he had done nothing
[41:28] wrong uh and he was taken the hard blows
[41:30] and I'm talking about you can you take
[41:32] the hard blows in life uh you should
[41:34] still be able to say father forgive me
[41:36] and Steven said I behold the son of a
[41:39] man standing he was sitting but he was
[41:43] giving step a standing ovation because
[41:45] Steven was doing exactly what Jesus had
[41:49] done so the master was saying that's
[41:52] exactly what I would have done or that's
[41:54] exactly how I played it or that's
[41:55] exactly like me they gave him a standing
[41:58] Evas because now he had a reflection of
[42:01] himself on the Earth where for doing
[42:03] nothing wrong for doing nothing wrong
[42:06] taking the hard blows in life he could
[42:08] have the attitude just to say father
[42:10] it's not an issue please forgive
[42:13] me remember it's only an issue if you
[42:15] wanted to be an issue yeah amen I I
[42:18] don't know whether you people got that
[42:20] or you missed that imagine that Steven
[42:23] is being stoned and you know you know
[42:25] they're kicking with with all Stones all
[42:27] over his face and flying all over his
[42:29] face and his body but you know uh he
[42:32] just says father forgive them and you
[42:35] know by saying that he looks and he sees
[42:40] the creator of Heaven and Earth standing
[42:43] he was not seated he was standing and
[42:45] the way brother brother Gary brought it
[42:47] is that that the creator of Heaven and
[42:49] Earth was giving him a standing OAS yes
[42:52] this is what I I I I I would have done
[42:54] this is what I did amen so it means it
[42:57] this the same thing that Jesus did when
[42:59] he was on Earth is the same same thing
[43:01] Steven did when when he was on Earth so
[43:04] it's the same thing we should do also
[43:05] forgive those who have hurt us and we
[43:08] have many in in Christianity people
[43:10] having bitterness you know holding
[43:13] bitterness you find even sometimes
[43:14] preachers have bitterness whereby when
[43:17] he comes to preach he really preaching
[43:19] the bitterness to the people and the
[43:21] people themselves become bitter because
[43:22] the minister has bitterness but when you
[43:25] release that I mean I've suffered this
[43:27] before and God delivered me you know
[43:29] when when you release that in your heart
[43:31] and you Minister you find that uh you
[43:33] know you Minister love you Minister
[43:36] forgiveness you Minister grace to the
[43:38] people and that impacts their life so I
[43:41] I I think you know uh when someone is
[43:43] born again they need to come to that
[43:45] place where they they are they love
[43:48] everybody if you're born again you will
[43:50] come to their place it will be automatic
[43:52] yeah uh yeah where they love everybody
[43:56] and no enemies does it my relationship
[43:59] with God is indicative to my
[44:02] relationship with the
[44:03] Brethren how can I love God and hate the
[44:07] you can say I love God but you have hate
[44:09] for somebody in your heart it's a lie
[44:12] you read you know it's a lie it's just
[44:15] the veneer of religion so my
[44:17] relationship with God is indicative of
[44:20] my relationship with the Brethren if I
[44:21] don't love the Brethren from a clean
[44:23] honest
[44:24] heart I do not love God
[44:28] and if you love your brother and your
[44:29] brother has offended you you're not
[44:30] going to keep it in your heart you're
[44:32] going to go over to them and say I'm
[44:34] offended here brother and I forgive you
[44:37] yeah you know you've released your heart
[44:40] how amazing offense Jesus said offense
[44:43] must come because uh this is the
[44:46] character this is the measure of the
[44:48] character of a man of a Christian you
[44:51] know that when offense comes I'm not
[44:54] going to feed my ego I don't need to
[44:55] protect my reput I don't need to uh
[44:59] fight back I don't need to bark back I
[45:01] don't need to protect anything I'm just
[45:03] more interested in their relationship
[45:05] with God so God is relying on me to get
[45:08] to him for them before he gets to them
[45:10] for me amen amen well that was a
[45:15] blessing to us so let's talk about this
[45:18] truck driver uhuh was it hard for you to
[45:21] forgive him no no it wasn't uh Roy his
[45:26] name is Roy Wilson what exactly happened
[45:28] like how did you get R over so Roy had
[45:31] rung up uh his his boss and said boss
[45:35] I'm not going to make it back to the
[45:36] depot in time uh because we've had
[45:39] issues at the loading B and his boss
[45:42] said Roy if you don't get back to this
[45:44] Depot on time you don't have a job so he
[45:47] was under pressure and everybody has at
[45:51] some stage broken the speed in
[45:54] there everybody has done stupid things
[45:57] everybody has done irresponsible things
[45:59] and unfortunately for
[46:01] Roy uh he was going a little bit too
[46:05] fast he was a little bit too
[46:08] overloaded and uh coming around the
[46:11] corner his trailers just rolled over
[46:14] yeah so a counselor said to me Mr Walker
[46:18] we need to do a psychiatric assessment
[46:20] on you and I said why is that and they
[46:23] said because you're too happy
[46:27] you're supposed to be sad they said they
[46:28] said we're concerned that there's some
[46:30] uh serious head injury there that is
[46:32] gone by misdiagnosed because you have a
[46:35] right to be angry and under normal
[46:38] circumstances you would be bitter and I
[46:40] said no no no I said look I fored all my
[46:43] rights when I became a Christian oh my
[46:45] praise so they said definitely now
[46:47] psychiatric
[46:49] assessment but we have something that
[46:51] the world knows nothing about you know
[46:53] uh I I met Roy my arm was in a brace
[46:56] because tenden to be torn off my
[46:57] shoulder my tricep the back of my arm
[47:00] had been torn off uh my ribs had been
[47:02] broken my shoulder blad had snapped in
[47:04] half so I was in a brace for three
[47:07] months and we met we we met Roy and he
[47:11] was genuinely sorry he was he was I
[47:15] consider his eyes you know he was tear
[47:17] he was teared up so I asked Deborah to
[47:20] take uh undo the straps of my arm and
[47:22] gently put my arm CU I couldn't move it
[47:24] put my arm on the table and I said Roy
[47:26] take my hand please I said I forgive you
[47:29] I said God forgave me I said as far as
[47:32] I'm concerned it's as if you never did
[47:34] it and everybody in the room broke them
[47:37] my God my God so we we uh we shook hands
[47:41] gently and sister de put my hand back in
[47:44] the brace and then I gave Roy
[47:48] P yeah is is is that man still living I
[47:51] don't know he went to jail uh he got
[47:54] sentenced to jail for 15 years uh cuz I
[47:57] I had I had uh officially died it was a
[48:00] man sort of touch uh but I wrote the
[48:02] judge a letter before the senten
[48:05] sentencing and I said I've met with Roy
[48:08] and I am convinced it was a genuine
[48:10] mistake we all make mistakes I said I
[48:12] don't hold anything against Roy I
[48:14] completely forgive him and I ask you to
[48:17] reflect that in your G so instead of
[48:20] getting seven years he got five 15 years
[48:22] he got five years okay okay so you could
[48:26] not be able to put him off the even the
[48:28] five years legally no yeah oh I said I
[48:32] forgive him I said I don't want him to
[48:33] go down it was just a mistake it was
[48:35] just an unfortunate mistake and they
[48:37] said but uh if you had have left home
[48:40] five minutes later this wouldn't have
[48:42] happened I said no I'm a Christian if I
[48:45] had left home five minutes later Roy
[48:48] would have left the depot five minutes
[48:50] later because brother Ram talks about
[48:53] predestinated Trial yeah did you hear
[48:56] that so so rather than being bitter just
[49:00] accept that all things work together for
[49:01] the good amen amen praise the lord well
[49:06] that's that's a blessing to me now being
[49:09] that U uh especially here in Africa many
[49:13] uh Christians suffer
[49:15] hardship and then they attribute it to
[49:18] many things um do you think that certain
[49:22] types of people maybe according to uh
[49:24] the place where they live or according
[49:26] to ethnicity or according to race or
[49:29] according to what do you think that
[49:30] certain groups of people are meant to
[49:33] suffer certain certain uh trials and and
[49:36] tests okay again that's Case by case uh
[49:40] it's no mistake it's nothing strange
[49:43] that you find yourself where you are
[49:45] you're not a mistake uh it's
[49:47] predestinated of God you're in the place
[49:49] where God predestinated you to be and
[49:52] all you need to do is take your
[49:53] circumstance and work it for your
[49:55] character whatever your circumstance is
[49:58] just work it for your character like God
[50:00] said to to Adam till the soil but he was
[50:03] living in Paradise why would want to
[50:04] till the soil it's it's just take your
[50:07] trial and work it just work it to your
[50:09] benefit uh if you are living in a first
[50:12] world country and you have all the first
[50:14] world blessings there's always somebody
[50:16] better off than you in the first world
[50:18] if you're in a third world there's
[50:19] always somebody off better than you and
[50:21] it just doesn't matter where you find
[50:23] yourself in don't compare yourself with
[50:25] somebody else just relax be comfortable
[50:28] in your own skin and know that God
[50:30] actually designed you to be where you
[50:32] are and you will reserved for a Time
[50:34] such as this and for a place such as
[50:36] this just work it to your benefit and
[50:39] it's all about developing character so
[50:41] that will be ready on WRA today amen so
[50:45] every everyone is the way God designed
[50:47] them to be yes sir um because because
[50:51] some young people have not accepted that
[50:53] you find uh that others will even do I
[50:56] mean how do they call it uh like
[50:58] changing the color of their skin you
[51:00] know using some kind of chemicals and
[51:03] others trying to um run away from their
[51:06] home or run away from their country I'm
[51:09] known I'm known as a great part because
[51:11] I believe that ugand is the best country
[51:13] you know I agree with it you agree with
[51:16] it I'm glad I got you on board so so you
[51:21] find that some people can't even work
[51:24] can't even think of what to do where God
[51:26] has placed them because they want to run
[51:28] up you know somewhere some other country
[51:30] uh the psychological statistics are that
[51:34] people that chase happiness end up being
[51:36] the most oppressed the only happiness
[51:39] that there is is in Jesus Christ people
[51:42] that try to better themselves and and
[51:44] I'm not say I'm not saying by no means
[51:46] am I suggesting that you don't try to
[51:48] better yourself I think you should but
[51:50] if you're trying to chase happiness
[51:52] brother Ram said life was not meant for
[51:54] being easy so if you find yourself in
[51:56] the first world or when I was in New
[51:59] Zealand uh and there was an economic
[52:03] crash a man got down to his last $5
[52:07] million couldn't handle and committed
[52:10] suicide oh my God so it doesn't matter
[52:12] where you are is the grass is always
[52:14] greener on the other side of the fence
[52:16] it's uh people that chase happiness will
[52:19] never find it and they are statistically
[52:22] proven to be the most unhappy people at
[52:24] the end of their life they are the
[52:26] bitter ones that were chasing chasing a
[52:27] rainbow never finding what they were
[52:29] looking for your only true happiness is
[52:32] in Jesus Christ amen no matter where you
[52:35] are no matter what in the middle of the
[52:37] storm if you have the Holy Ghost yeah
[52:40] the true happiness is in Christ yes and
[52:43] so um these are nuggets Brother Gary and
[52:47] I know it's getting to my heart I hope
[52:49] it's getting to the hearts of the people
[52:50] who are here and those who are online um
[52:53] I I think these are very important words
[52:55] that we get to hear them sometimes I
[52:57] think even we as preachers have a
[52:59] temptation of preaching uh joy as uh the
[53:04] absence of suffering and test and hard
[53:07] life uh health wealth and prosperity is
[53:11] a devil's Doctrine uh the Bible says
[53:13] that God knows all our needs we know all
[53:16] our wants so I want I want everything
[53:18] that's going to make life better for me
[53:21] but God knows I need character so that
[53:24] means that I need hard times
[53:27] I need tests I need trials that's what I
[53:30] need so God said I know your needs and
[53:32] God said I will supply your needs I
[53:35] that's I am not going to supply my
[53:38] trials because I'm trying to make life
[53:40] comfortable so God said well because I
[53:43] know what's going to get you ready for a
[53:44] Rapture I know your needs so you uh you
[53:47] will never be able to dodge hard times
[53:51] you cannot Escape offense and trials
[53:55] will always be there there until The
[53:57] Bitter End but in the middle of the
[54:00] trial you can smile and really for
[54:02] worship to be something tangible to God
[54:06] is that when life itself turns itself
[54:08] against you just say hallelujah anyway
[54:12] Hallelujah anyway everybody say
[54:13] hallelujah
[54:14] anyway amen now uh I understand that the
[54:19] doctors say that you will never be able
[54:21] to uh see because you had issues with
[54:23] your eyes you couldn't see anymore uh
[54:26] you could hear what else couldn't you do
[54:28] couldn't speak you couldn't speak oh you
[54:30] couldn't speak even couldn't close my
[54:32] eyes you couldn't close your eyes um uh
[54:35] you couldn't walk couldn't walk uh
[54:36] couldn't roll over you couldn't roll
[54:38] over I couldn't use my left hand side
[54:39] completely completely you couldn't bend
[54:42] over no and the doctor said these things
[54:45] will never be restored against they were
[54:47] amazed that I had made it uh they were
[54:50] just amazed of the alive and they said
[54:52] these things are feminal absolutely
[54:54] feminal and uh I can walk I can talk I
[54:58] can close my eyes I can drive a car I
[55:01] can think I can remember you can drive a
[55:03] car yeah think about and and brother
[55:05] Buzz brother Buzz uh I took an IQ three
[55:08] IQ tests uh several years ago and I had
[55:12] a higher IQ Point than before the
[55:15] accident my God my God so this it's the
[55:20] grace of God it's a grace of God Amen so
[55:23] you can do everything the daughter said
[55:24] you will never be able to do again
[55:27] so what do you think that the situation
[55:29] and you know the devil has told you that
[55:30] you cannot be able to achieve or to do
[55:33] you know it's all a lie from the devil
[55:35] it doesn't matter what the devil says
[55:36] that you can't be able to achieve or
[55:38] can't be able to do if God says yes no
[55:40] one can say no if God opens the door no
[55:42] man can shut it here we have a testimony
[55:45] before us so we don't want to listen to
[55:47] what the devil has to say we already
[55:49] have seen what God has to
[55:50] say so throughout this process uh
[55:53] Brother Gary did you ever ask yourself
[55:55] why me because while you are answering
[55:58] that I want you to know that there are
[56:00] people going through other situations of
[56:01] life and they have that question oh God
[56:04] why be why me some others I w't even go
[56:06] to church again if God is good why
[56:08] didn't he take me through out of this
[56:09] situation okay if you have the attitude
[56:11] and God bless your hearts you know I'm
[56:13] your brother uh I'm not UNC
[56:15] christianizing you I'm not demonizing
[56:17] you but if you have the attitude for me
[56:19] why me I suggest you
[56:22] gra just just grab uh I was convinced
[56:26] that uh God's pure Divine hatred was
[56:30] upon me but I never felt sorry for
[56:33] myself I just thought I wonder what I've
[56:35] done wrong I just I wonder what I've
[56:37] done wrong and then one night on my
[56:40] right hand side the pillar of fire came
[56:41] into the into the bedroom the uh I was
[56:44] there by myself and they have even what
[56:46] they called uh even unbelievers experien
[56:49] what they call the pain Monster uh it's
[56:51] like the Yates gate Theory where the the
[56:54] uh nervous system can only take so much
[56:55] information
[56:57] and uh what what what seems to happen in
[57:00] the mind is that it it rolls out of the
[57:02] body and stands next to you even
[57:04] unbeliev testify it stands on your left
[57:07] hand side and it just waits for you to
[57:10] consume all this pain and then there's
[57:13] more coming so it's like sheep trying to
[57:15] get through a little gate thousands of
[57:17] sheep you can only get so many sheep
[57:18] through the gate at one time what the Y
[57:20] C and anyway that was happening to me at
[57:22] the time I was uh I was crying I was
[57:24] shaking I was uh in a a lot of pain the
[57:28] doctor said if we give you any morphine
[57:30] any more morphine it's going to turn
[57:31] your brain off so I was in that
[57:34] condition and then the P fire came in on
[57:36] the right hand side and I can't explain
[57:39] how it happens because uh the Unseen is
[57:43] more real uh I can't explain I I'll just
[57:47] tell you how it was okay uh it was a
[57:51] purifier but he had his arms folded but
[57:54] he had no arms and he leaned forward but
[57:57] it wasn't a body it was a pillar of fire
[58:00] uh and he said without saying it was uh
[58:04] he said will you worship me and I'm in
[58:07] this pain I am in pain that I can't
[58:09] describe and I couldn't talk and I
[58:11] thought in my mind I thought of course I
[58:15] worship you of course you know though he
[58:18] slame me joke though he slame me you all
[58:20] trust me regardless of what you find
[58:24] yourself in don't feel sorry for
[58:26] yourself if you do feel sorry for
[58:27] yourself uh read the scripture where
[58:29] Paul says when I was a child I did jish
[58:32] things yeah there's a growing up time so
[58:35] I said to the Lord of course I will and
[58:38] as soon as I thought those words the
[58:41] pain from the top of my head to the so
[58:43] of my foot flushed out completely no
[58:45] pain and when you've been in that much
[58:48] pain and then you're not in any pain it
[58:51] is sweet it is so sweet and then the
[58:54] pufi disappeared and two or three
[58:56] seconds later a nurse walked into my
[58:58] room she took three or four steps into
[59:00] the room and stopped and she said what
[59:03] has been going on in here because you
[59:05] get the
[59:06] anointing and I I was just lying there
[59:09] just smiling no pain just in such peace
[59:13] you know um just I say that not to Pat
[59:16] myself on the back or to give you some
[59:18] sort of spiritual resume I'm just saying
[59:21] don't feel sorry for yourself nothing
[59:23] good and comfortable yeah just
[59:26] all things work together for the good
[59:29] and he is always there yeah and just
[59:32] because he's silent doesn't mean he's
[59:36] absent praise the name of the Lord this
[59:39] is very encouraging you know uh instead
[59:42] of pitting yourself and you know feeling
[59:44] like uh you are in the worst situation
[59:48] because people have a tendency of
[59:50] thinking that look I'm the worst if you
[59:53] if you were where I was if you knew what
[59:55] I knew if you felt what I felt you would
[59:57] not have said that I feel I am very
[59:59] qualified to say the things that I do uh
[1:00:02] if uh if you've been through what I've
[1:00:04] been through then maybe you can do those
[1:00:06] yourself but until then don't do
[1:00:09] it yeah honestly nothing good can come
[1:00:13] from it you wear your own faith down uh
[1:00:16] it's just the veneer of religion if
[1:00:18] you've really been born again I mean I'm
[1:00:20] talking you've had a a real Encounter
[1:00:23] With Jesus Christ remember the woman at
[1:00:25] the well
[1:00:26] M she she went to fetch water from a
[1:00:29] well and found a well sitting on a well
[1:00:33] and Jesus was The Well of life he said
[1:00:34] if you drink of this water you'll never
[1:00:36] thirst again yes and when she knew that
[1:00:38] this was the promise the Bible says she
[1:00:41] dropped her water pots and ran into the
[1:00:43] town if you've really had an encounter
[1:00:46] with Jesus Christ there's going to be
[1:00:47] some stuff you're going to have to drop
[1:00:50] and the biggest one is going to be your
[1:00:51] pride in the amen praise God now now uh
[1:00:56] brother bham in the same court this
[1:00:58] Manan Church age uh he says he may
[1:01:02] commit you to death as he did Paul which
[1:01:05] he did to you for just a few moments and
[1:01:08] he says he may commit you to suffering
[1:01:10] as he did job which actually happened to
[1:01:12] you I think in talking to you I realized
[1:01:14] that you lost all the things you were
[1:01:16] doing you lost your job you lost your
[1:01:18] businesses and everything he says that
[1:01:20] he it is his prerogative he is Sovereign
[1:01:24] but it is all with a purpose yes if he
[1:01:27] did not have a purpose that then he
[1:01:29] would be the author of frustration and
[1:01:31] not of Peace his purpose is that after
[1:01:33] we have suffered a while we would be
[1:01:36] made perfect be established strengthened
[1:01:38] and settled it took you two two years to
[1:01:41] get to get
[1:01:42] well uh I was in the hospital for nine
[1:01:46] months and uh I would say it took uh
[1:01:50] another five years another five years to
[1:01:53] uh become functional
[1:01:56] so you can lay in the corner and feel
[1:01:57] sorry for
[1:01:58] yourself it's nothing's going to happen
[1:02:00] you
[1:02:01] know pet Peter and John they said uh
[1:02:03] silver and God will be none but in the
[1:02:05] name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk
[1:02:07] brother BR said nothing happened nothing
[1:02:10] happened so they grabbed him by the arm
[1:02:12] and as they were lifting him then the
[1:02:14] strength came back amen yeah yeah so
[1:02:17] there's something for us to do yeah not
[1:02:20] only to believe it but to act as we
[1:02:23] believe it so God has a purpose
[1:02:25] throughout those five years five six
[1:02:28] seven years about seven years or so and
[1:02:31] the pain you went through the loss you
[1:02:33] went through the frustrations you went
[1:02:34] through uh did you ever figure out the
[1:02:37] big picture that God had yes when I was
[1:02:40] H room uh I said to the Lord I said Lord
[1:02:44] what do you want from me in this
[1:02:46] condition because remember I couldn't
[1:02:47] remember my wife and my children and but
[1:02:50] I I I I still remembered having a
[1:02:53] relationship with the Lord that's when
[1:02:54] you're born again it's in the sub
[1:02:56] conscience so I was praying I said Lord
[1:02:58] what do you want from me in this
[1:03:01] condition and the Lord said to me if you
[1:03:04] knew the big picture you would have
[1:03:07] volunteered for it amen and I thought
[1:03:10] Within Myself
[1:03:12] no no uh but now uh years down the track
[1:03:17] and seeing how it has encouraged other
[1:03:19] people uh even people listening to the
[1:03:22] testimony receive a healing while
[1:03:24] they're listening to the testimony yes I
[1:03:27] yeah okay okay yes Lord uh now I can see
[1:03:31] the big picture and for the body for
[1:03:34] your people if I have to yep I'll do it
[1:03:37] again you told me maybe you can tell us
[1:03:40] a few testimonies this that you told me
[1:03:42] about of the man I think from the US and
[1:03:45] you know and how God spoke to him if you
[1:03:48] could you could oh okay the Tes yes I
[1:03:51] received maybe a few others I received a
[1:03:53] phone call about five years ago from a
[1:03:55] gentleman in in America he's not a
[1:03:56] Believer he's a Christian of some sort
[1:03:58] but not a believer in the message and he
[1:04:01] asked me he saidis this the Gary Walker
[1:04:04] uh that has the testimony of being dead
[1:04:07] three times and I said yes it is and he
[1:04:10] said uh I just want to phone you and
[1:04:13] thank you for uh what happened and he
[1:04:17] gave me uh his testimony that his father
[1:04:21] had died and his brother had died of uh
[1:04:25] a drug
[1:04:26] over and he was so such in a bad way
[1:04:30] that he was
[1:04:31] suicidal and uh he went to sleep one
[1:04:33] night and in his dream he had a dream a
[1:04:35] spiritual dream in his dream uh his dad
[1:04:39] his father his brother and himself were
[1:04:41] on the boat the three of them on the
[1:04:43] boat and he knew in the dream that his
[1:04:45] dad and his brother were dead and his
[1:04:48] dad stood up on the boat walked to the
[1:04:51] son the man that I'm talking to on the
[1:04:53] phone grabbed him by the collar and and
[1:04:55] said you have to go online and watch
[1:04:58] Gary Walker's
[1:05:00] testimony so he woke up and he went
[1:05:03] straight to the computer and he found
[1:05:05] out Gary Walker three times year was
[1:05:06] still alive watched the testimony and at
[1:05:09] the end of the testimony uh that Spirit
[1:05:11] of uh suicide had left him and
[1:05:16] uh yes so we we just I just thank the
[1:05:21] Lord that uh the Lord was able to use me
[1:05:24] to uh bless other people
[1:05:27] amen now you can see the big picture
[1:05:29] yeah do you think were you in Ministry
[1:05:32] before the accident of course yes and
[1:05:34] after did you see a
[1:05:36] change uh in your approach to the word I
[1:05:39] could identify with suffering like never
[1:05:42] before I could identify with other
[1:05:44] people suffering and I I never
[1:05:46] understood because because before the
[1:05:48] accident I was very Steely I I owned
[1:05:50] several businesses uh I was a
[1:05:52] non-nonsense sort of a person black was
[1:05:54] black white was white I I was I was
[1:05:57] quite stealing you know uh but after the
[1:05:59] accident I think I'm a lot more pliable
[1:06:02] I understand other people's sufferings
[1:06:05] uh I think I think I'm a better person
[1:06:07] for I actually I know I'm a better
[1:06:10] person for having gone through what I
[1:06:12] went through yeah and that's just the
[1:06:14] that's the plan of God and I've seen
[1:06:16] that you know we were in carja uh we've
[1:06:19] been in carja two three days
[1:06:22] ago and we had about a
[1:06:26] 2,000 people or 2,500 people in one of
[1:06:29] those meetings and we were all tired the
[1:06:33] previous night we had almost slept spent
[1:06:35] on the road uh with Brother Gary brother
[1:06:38] Timothy and the two brothers that we
[1:06:39] went with from church and um very tired
[1:06:44] weary of course if I was tired to that
[1:06:47] magnitude I believe Brother Gary was
[1:06:48] more tired than I was and and so uh that
[1:06:54] following day um
[1:06:56] an idea came up you know to have a
[1:06:58] prayer line for the people
[1:07:02] orices
[1:07:05] and after that just
[1:07:10] go so I I was so impressed when you know
[1:07:14] of course myself and the other brother
[1:07:16] was like okay you have a prayer line you
[1:07:18] know it can take six hours which can
[1:07:20] take quite a number of
[1:07:22] hours uh but especially
[1:07:25] that you had a
[1:07:27] heart would understand you know what
[1:07:29] going I think I remember saying Max you
[1:07:34] know and you know no wonder many times
[1:07:38] Brother people to check the spe of their
[1:07:41] P which is not entirely especially if
[1:07:44] you have a good pastor like I've noticed
[1:07:47] that kind of character that I've SE
[1:07:50] also you
[1:07:53] know I got it I got it from
[1:07:56] you
[1:07:57] got okay you know having a heart for the
[1:08:00] people feeling for the people and I
[1:08:02] think also you canot minister to the
[1:08:04] people without having heart for them you
[1:08:05] have to love them you have to feel for
[1:08:07] them absolutely yeah or it's just a
[1:08:09] religious act you know you have to love
[1:08:12] that person you have to feel for them
[1:08:13] you have to enter into their suffering
[1:08:15] and then you can expect something
[1:08:17] brother you need to say more about this
[1:08:19] because there are many young people who
[1:08:21] are going into Ministry and they need to
[1:08:23] understand yeah so there's more there's
[1:08:26] more to Ministry than just uh trying to
[1:08:29] be a
[1:08:30] celebrity uh a minister should be a
[1:08:34] servant if you are trying to build a
[1:08:36] kingdom or build a name please go and
[1:08:39] try
[1:08:41] golf don't enter into the ministry until
[1:08:44] you can you're willing to spend yourself
[1:08:46] sacrifice yourself because uh for all
[1:08:49] you young brothers that want to go into
[1:08:50] the ministry it's all about the people
[1:08:54] it's not about building calling a name
[1:08:56] or a kingdom it's about serving God's
[1:08:58] people and if you don't have that
[1:09:00] attitude for goodness sake stay off the
[1:09:01] field please
[1:09:03] please well right there I think we just
[1:09:06] go for a a short break of
[1:09:08] about you know just take a sip of
[1:09:12] water
[1:09:24] again
[1:09:54] for
[1:10:24] e
[1:10:54] e
[1:11:24] e
[1:11:54] e
[1:12:24] e
[1:12:54] e
[1:13:24] e
[1:13:54] e
[1:14:24] e
[1:14:54] e
[1:15:23] e
[1:15:53] e
[1:16:23] e
[1:16:53] e
[1:17:23] e e
[1:18:19] the
[1:18:53] l for
[1:19:12] [Music]
[1:19:53] e
[1:20:23] e
[1:20:53] e
[1:21:23] e
[1:21:53] e
[1:22:23] e
[1:22:53] e
[1:23:23] e e
[1:24:24] for
[1:25:07] well I'm told we're
[1:25:09] back um I'd like to welcome you once
[1:25:11] again to uh to uh the bench with uh uh
[1:25:16] Brother Gary Walker once again we're
[1:25:19] just concluding and making a few final
[1:25:22] touches uh on this wonderful test there
[1:25:24] quite a lot of things to talk about
[1:25:25] Brother Gary a lot of things to learn a
[1:25:28] lot of things to go through if we we we
[1:25:30] continue uh I think we cannot uh fit in
[1:25:34] within the program but um we have this
[1:25:37] book I don't know if someone wants this
[1:25:40] book where how where can they find
[1:25:46] it is there brother M brother Gary's
[1:25:49] microphone on
[1:25:59] is it on Amazon
[1:26:02] so uh if you just go on Amazon and you
[1:26:05] search three times dead but still alive
[1:26:09] that's how it looks and I promise that I
[1:26:12] would give out some I don't know if
[1:26:13] they're here yet uh I promise that I
[1:26:16] would give out a few books to uh some
[1:26:18] people who would ask outstanding
[1:26:20] questions that would be a blessing to
[1:26:23] others so I have a three books with me
[1:26:26] that I'll give out as a gift before we
[1:26:28] end this program so uh it's it's quite a
[1:26:31] good thing I think many of us don't like
[1:26:34] reading yeah but if we can teach
[1:26:36] ourselves to read we can really be
[1:26:38] blessed reading is very good and very
[1:26:40] important for us uh you know books like
[1:26:43] this uh I I always want to
[1:26:46] say it's a product of the message of the
[1:26:48] hour you know someone who has met God
[1:26:51] been impacted by God been impacted by
[1:26:54] the the ministry of Malachi 4 and you
[1:26:57] know has a testimony like this it's
[1:26:59] worth our time worth for us to go and
[1:27:02] read it uh so I think we ended it there
[1:27:06] brother Gary when you were talking about
[1:27:08] how the big picture and how this
[1:27:11] impacted your life going forward in the
[1:27:12] ministry afterwards right yes uh it it
[1:27:17] helped me just to understand uh the
[1:27:20] sufferings of others it helped me to
[1:27:22] understand that uh uh because at that
[1:27:25] stage of my life really everything I
[1:27:28] enjoyed the challenge I was the type of
[1:27:30] guy that uh I just I would take the ball
[1:27:33] by the horns you know uh but then I
[1:27:35] found myself in a place where I was
[1:27:37] completely helpless and I had to depend
[1:27:40] on the help of others and I hadn't been
[1:27:42] there before so I I can uh I
[1:27:46] can understand how people feel bit
[1:27:51] Yeah so if you are going through
[1:27:55] something in your life as an individual
[1:27:58] that sometimes you feel or you think
[1:28:00] that um God has forgotten you sometimes
[1:28:03] it is because God is trying to mold your
[1:28:05] character for you to be um to have a
[1:28:09] life that impacts others in a better way
[1:28:11] and I just gave you that testimony in
[1:28:13] carja I could I could tell uh that uh I
[1:28:18] was I had gone there with Christians uh
[1:28:21] you know having a heart for the people
[1:28:24] and you know the desire to serve and
[1:28:26] minister to the people of God knowing
[1:28:28] that and I think this is something also
[1:28:30] you have to talk about Brother Gary
[1:28:32] because I know it is scriptural knowing
[1:28:34] that a pastor or minister of the Gospel
[1:28:37] is not the the law is not like Lord over
[1:28:41] the people but he is a
[1:28:44] servant and can you talk a little bit
[1:28:46] about servant leadership as far as the
[1:28:49] message is concerned okay so God God
[1:28:51] gave us uh fivefold Ministry God gave us
[1:28:54] uh helps God gave us uh those things for
[1:28:57] the benefit of the body uh so the body
[1:29:00] could edify itself so really the
[1:29:02] fivefold ministry should be trying to
[1:29:03] put themselves out of a job by getting
[1:29:05] the people to a place where they can
[1:29:08] understand who and what they are because
[1:29:09] really if you if you understand or you
[1:29:12] know who you are then it doesn't matter
[1:29:14] what people say that you're not uh you
[1:29:16] don't need accolades you don't need
[1:29:18] slaps on the back you don't need anybody
[1:29:20] holding your hand you're able to stand
[1:29:21] by yourself and that's what the
[1:29:23] ministry's job is for is to uh is to get
[1:29:28] the people to a place where they
[1:29:30] understand who and what they are in
[1:29:32] Christ so uh I always say a preacher is
[1:29:37] not a celebrity a preacher is a servant
[1:29:42] uh outside of
[1:29:43] that you've got the wrong idea you know
[1:29:46] uh the preachers are for the people they
[1:29:49] they're for the people uh to serve the
[1:29:51] people to get the people to a position
[1:29:53] where they can stand by themselves and
[1:29:55] where we go to church but finally we
[1:29:57] don't need
[1:29:59] church so the preacher is for the people
[1:30:03] absolutely a preacher is a servant a not
[1:30:05] someone supposed to be served
[1:30:07] necessarily but someone supposed to
[1:30:09] serve and I think this is what uh many
[1:30:13] ministers lack and many young people
[1:30:16] going into the ministry they go into the
[1:30:18] ministry of the wrong attitude thinking
[1:30:20] they're going to be served instead of
[1:30:21] them serving Jesus is your example so
[1:30:24] anything uh you need as a Christian just
[1:30:26] look at Jesus So speaking about ministry
[1:30:29] here we have a servant King uh deity and
[1:30:33] service to die gold frankincense and Mir
[1:30:36] uh an attitude every preacher's attitude
[1:30:39] should be we are here to be spent for
[1:30:42] the people not for the people to serve
[1:30:44] us yeah now brother Gary would you uh be
[1:30:48] able to ascribe your ability to go
[1:30:52] through this trial success sucessfully
[1:30:55] because of
[1:30:56] this of the revelation of the message of
[1:30:59] the hour yes uh you can do anything
[1:31:03] successfully if you're born again uh all
[1:31:07] the answers are in the New Birth uh
[1:31:11] there's no Magic Carpet there's no magic
[1:31:14] wand it's all in the New Birth if you
[1:31:18] have Jesus you have it all
[1:31:22] yeah um let's let's talk about the enti
[1:31:25] message
[1:31:26] mhm uh how do you understand the enti
[1:31:30] message uh the the message was sent to
[1:31:33] us to identify who we are that the
[1:31:36] message is not about a prophet that we
[1:31:38] thank God for a prophet the message is
[1:31:41] not uh for us to idolize the message the
[1:31:45] message is a tool uh given to us to help
[1:31:49] us to identify who we are in Christ even
[1:31:53] a lot the Bible says behold I send unto
[1:31:56] you Elijah so it wasn't for us to lift
[1:31:59] brother brandham up on a pedestal uh it
[1:32:01] was for us to acknowledge that this is
[1:32:03] son of man this is the absolute this is
[1:32:06] the voice of God this is thus sayith the
[1:32:08] Lord uh and then to move on to the real
[1:32:13] purpose of the message and that is are
[1:32:16] in Christ so in other words the message
[1:32:19] is not about the messenger it's about
[1:32:21] the recipients of the messenger yes
[1:32:23] absolutely behold I send you Elijah yes
[1:32:27] praise the name of the Lord so so in
[1:32:29] other words um what would you have to
[1:32:32] say to the people the Brethren some of
[1:32:34] them also who then now get sentiments
[1:32:38] that we don't even need to quot we don't
[1:32:40] even need to quot brother bham we don't
[1:32:42] need to uh quot you know read it like
[1:32:46] public to the people okay I would say
[1:32:48] first uh love you we love you we
[1:32:51] appreciate you uh but uh brother Brandon
[1:32:55] was first fruits anything more ripe than
[1:32:58] first fruits is
[1:33:02] rotten uh you cannot go beyond the
[1:33:05] prophet you can come up to where he
[1:33:09] was that's I just love some of the
[1:33:13] phrases you make I I I hope I hope you
[1:33:15] heard that you say brother Bram was the
[1:33:18] first fruits in this hour and anything
[1:33:20] more ripe than the first fruit is rotten
[1:33:23] the truth by the way if you look at it
[1:33:26] even in the in the real life life you
[1:33:28] know uh perspective you know so
[1:33:33] uh I I don't know I think there's more
[1:33:35] you can say to that okay so uh brother
[1:33:38] bam said I'm going to hit the high spots
[1:33:40] and I want you to go home and dig down
[1:33:42] deep so there's only so much that you
[1:33:45] can explain uh about logos or the
[1:33:48] thought of God with words so brother
[1:33:51] Benham did his best to describe
[1:33:54] something with words in this Dimension
[1:33:57] uh but there is a higher reality than
[1:33:59] words all we can do with words is paint
[1:34:03] fragmented pictures so if you take the
[1:34:06] message of the hour take what the
[1:34:08] prophet said and dig down deep then
[1:34:10] you'll catch the thought behind it so
[1:34:12] you're not adding to you're not taking
[1:34:14] away you're just entering into that
[1:34:16] Supernatural element because brother bam
[1:34:18] said something can be revealed to you
[1:34:20] but still the supernatural element is
[1:34:22] missing so you can listen listen to the
[1:34:24] tapes and they do no good unless you get
[1:34:26] into the spirit of Revelation dig down
[1:34:28] deep and then you'll catch the logos or
[1:34:30] the thought behind it which can't be
[1:34:32] explained with words so we're not adding
[1:34:35] to we're not taking away we're just
[1:34:37] getting into the place of what the
[1:34:39] prophet was trying to paint with
[1:34:41] words because then you have you're going
[1:34:44] to have two extremes some saying well
[1:34:47] you have only to read or listen to what
[1:34:50] he said no preaching and then you'll
[1:34:52] have others say well you you you know
[1:34:56] it's um it's only the preacher you don't
[1:34:59] need to uh quot anything you don't need
[1:35:02] to refer to brother bham and things like
[1:35:05] that I think the problem is still the
[1:35:07] same they need to get into the spirit of
[1:35:09] the of the message AB absolutely uh or
[1:35:12] else they're just forming another
[1:35:13] religion and it's like a dog going back
[1:35:15] to its vomit the very thing that that
[1:35:17] God sent a prophet for was to drag us
[1:35:19] out of organized religion uh to pull us
[1:35:22] out of being churchy and to get to a
[1:35:25] place where we understand who and what
[1:35:26] we are that's the big picture and uh
[1:35:29] brother bam said if you want to miss the
[1:35:31] rap if you want if you want to miss the
[1:35:32] tribulation period you better dig deep
[1:35:36] yeah and the prophet said God will never
[1:35:38] use a coward so we're not adding to
[1:35:40] we're not taking away we're just
[1:35:42] catching that Spirit of Revelation that
[1:35:45] we can Now understand spiritually what
[1:35:48] cannot be said with
[1:35:50] words you know I I I when when you start
[1:35:54] speaking I I'm I'm I'm just beginning to
[1:35:56] listen in and then you stop I think I
[1:35:59] think you you are also feeling the same
[1:36:00] way right yeah yeah you should you
[1:36:02] should continue because this is sweet I
[1:36:04] mean you know the revelation of the word
[1:36:07] is sweet friends especially when someone
[1:36:09] is speaking not his ideas but speaking
[1:36:12] the message because it's not this
[1:36:14] message is not about us about people
[1:36:16] about um rather ministers it's about the
[1:36:19] people that have been called to know who
[1:36:22] they are this is what this is all about
[1:36:24] this is why we even having this bench so
[1:36:27] that this is why we have church so that
[1:36:29] we can come and get to know who we are
[1:36:31] because when you know who you are then
[1:36:33] you cannot be defeated by Satan no
[1:36:35] matter what you know when you go through
[1:36:37] a lot of things in your life but the
[1:36:39] devil cannot defeat you because you
[1:36:41] realize you you've come to the
[1:36:42] realization of who you are I think this
[1:36:45] is what this this message is all about
[1:36:47] um even when you go through tough times
[1:36:50] like I cannot help to think that I would
[1:36:53] not want to go through what you went
[1:36:55] through um uh because I don't know
[1:36:59] whether I have the strength in me to
[1:37:01] sail
[1:37:02] through but if God would be able to take
[1:37:05] one brother one man through it so that
[1:37:08] he can come back afterwards and see and
[1:37:10] say to us look I see the big picture if
[1:37:13] I'm able to go I I I see the big picture
[1:37:15] I went through it because of this we too
[1:37:18] are going through our own it may not be
[1:37:20] an accident it might be it might not be
[1:37:23] loss of this lot loss of that but we we
[1:37:25] are also going through our own our own
[1:37:27] hardships our own trials and um uh I I
[1:37:31] trust that we can borrow a Lea from this
[1:37:33] and say well we have to face it we have
[1:37:36] to face it you said a statement and he
[1:37:39] said it's not always going to be easy no
[1:37:42] no uh it cannot be God God will make
[1:37:45] sure that it's not uh because if you
[1:37:48] just go through Easy Street you're not
[1:37:51] going to have the character for a
[1:37:53] Rapture so the crown that we wear is
[1:37:57] weighty uh and it's too weighty for a
[1:38:00] light head for a weak head you have to
[1:38:02] have the character to wear that crown of
[1:38:05] course that's a metaphor for a new body
[1:38:07] you know but if you're going to if
[1:38:09] you're going to be in Rapture you're
[1:38:11] going to have to have the character of
[1:38:12] Jesus Christ and the only way to do that
[1:38:14] is suffering if there was a better way
[1:38:16] God would use it and then we would
[1:38:18] complain about that yeah if there was a
[1:38:21] better way God would use it but that's
[1:38:23] the only way that's the only way and it
[1:38:26] is in the message brother Bas actually
[1:38:28] he is saying what brother Bama said
[1:38:29] these are not new things but it what
[1:38:32] makes it new for us is that he has
[1:38:34] experienced it he can speak what he has
[1:38:37] experienced by the way before you
[1:38:39] experience something you can never
[1:38:40] preach it I realize that many many
[1:38:43] sermons that I preach that really get to
[1:38:45] impact people is something I've gone
[1:38:47] through overcome it or experienced it
[1:38:49] and God has given me the grace to
[1:38:50] overcome it and then I can come and
[1:38:52] preach it by experience with the
[1:38:53] experience and then the spirit takes
[1:38:56] after that and then impacts the people
[1:38:58] and that's why I thought is very
[1:38:59] important for us to hear this testimony
[1:39:01] how many are being blessed by this
[1:39:03] testimony praise the name of the Lord so
[1:39:05] I I I don't know before we get into the
[1:39:07] other things Brother Gary whatever is
[1:39:09] left over or that we've not talked about
[1:39:12] about this accident and um you know and
[1:39:16] in connection to your life and Ministry
[1:39:18] that you think that the people would
[1:39:20] need to hear I think uh very uh
[1:39:23] important thing for the young people to
[1:39:24] hear for those that are watching online
[1:39:26] or archives uh is the question of sin
[1:39:29] because uh we need to we need to finally
[1:39:31] come to a conclusion and settle the sin
[1:39:34] question because too often the devil
[1:39:36] gets the advantage over you and you'll
[1:39:38] always think you're not good enough to
[1:39:40] be used by God uh somebody asked brother
[1:39:43] bam a question can a Christian sin and
[1:39:46] the prophet said absolutely no he said
[1:39:50] there's no scripture for that it's
[1:39:52] completely impossible for a Son of God
[1:39:54] to sin yeah so so then we say well what
[1:39:58] what what about all the stuff that you
[1:40:00] know the what we would classify as Sin
[1:40:02] is not really sin it's just obstacles to
[1:40:05] overcome to prove your appreciation for
[1:40:08] god making you
[1:40:11] sinless if you if you don't see it like
[1:40:13] that you'll always be condemned and
[1:40:15] you'll always think you're not good
[1:40:17] enough uh to enter into the field that
[1:40:19] God has called you to so you need to
[1:40:21] settle the sin question in your your
[1:40:23] heart God knows exactly God knows
[1:40:25] exactly that you you hate that thing
[1:40:28] that you love remember if it's a
[1:40:30] legitimate Temptation you've got to want
[1:40:32] it and it's got to be available
[1:40:34] everybody that's honest uh knows that
[1:40:37] there is the lust of the eye the lust of
[1:40:39] the Flesh and the pride of life and uh
[1:40:42] before you were born again uh there was
[1:40:45] no fight you just did what you wanted to
[1:40:46] do because it was your life and you just
[1:40:48] did it but when you receive the Holy
[1:40:50] Ghost that's when the fight starts and
[1:40:52] that's when when you start feeling like
[1:40:54] a walking Civil War because there's two
[1:40:56] dogs on the inside a white one and a
[1:40:58] black one brother brand said I found two
[1:41:00] William Brams in here now one wants the
[1:41:03] things of the word and the other wants
[1:41:05] the things of the world so that old
[1:41:07] nature didn't go anywhere it's just
[1:41:09] standing very very close to you and it
[1:41:11] wants the things that you know now you
[1:41:14] shouldn't have so God knows that you
[1:41:17] hate the things you love like Paul said
[1:41:19] in Romans seven he said the things that
[1:41:21] I should do I don't do and the things
[1:41:23] that I shouldn't do well oh riched man
[1:41:26] that I am so God God God knows that
[1:41:27] there's a war on the inside but don't
[1:41:29] let that get the better of you because
[1:41:31] if you do you'll be useless in the
[1:41:33] kingdom of God you need to be functional
[1:41:36] and to be functional you need to settle
[1:41:38] the sin question that there is no sin
[1:41:41] there's just obstacles to overcome amen
[1:41:44] amen Ah that's a very powerful
[1:41:48] utterance uh is for something to be a
[1:41:51] legitimate temptation it has to be say
[1:41:54] can you say that again you got to want
[1:41:56] it and got it be available okay now I
[1:41:59] speak it in in Uganda and English okay
[1:42:02] for something to be a
[1:42:04] legitimate uh Temptation you have to
[1:42:07] want it and it has to be available like
[1:42:10] Jesus with the with the bread Satan said
[1:42:13] if that be the Son of God turn the this
[1:42:16] this rock into yeah into bread yeah
[1:42:18] brother B said Satan made that rock
[1:42:20] smell like freshly baked bread straight
[1:42:23] out of the oven after a 40-day fast it
[1:42:26] was there he wanted it yeah it was
[1:42:29] available yeah but he said it's written
[1:42:32] yeah yeah so for it to be a legitimate
[1:42:34] Temptation you've got to want it yeah
[1:42:37] it's got to be available but the new
[1:42:39] birth empowers us to overcome it so just
[1:42:42] because you wanted doesn't mean you're
[1:42:44] not a son of God yeah so you love it you
[1:42:47] love the things you H but the new birth
[1:42:50] gives you power to overcome
[1:42:53] that's why it is important for each of
[1:42:55] us by the way to be born again truly
[1:42:57] Born Again must yeah it's a must it's
[1:43:00] not a may be it's a
[1:43:02] must and when you when you meet a man a
[1:43:05] woman that is born again you don't need
[1:43:07] to ask them whether they are because you
[1:43:09] will see it by the life it's just like
[1:43:11] what you're preaching to us today that's
[1:43:13] what faith is as well you know because
[1:43:16] you you get to see that the the life of
[1:43:19] the man itself will speak it's not uh so
[1:43:22] much of of the words but it's so much of
[1:43:24] the life because they're truly born
[1:43:26] again and I have a few questions for you
[1:43:28] here brother Gary and if there's anybody
[1:43:30] here who has also questions I think um
[1:43:34] uh as your pastor would approve of you
[1:43:36] to ask because uh I I've found Brother
[1:43:40] Gary to be someone who is deep in the
[1:43:42] word and he loves this message of the
[1:43:43] hour and I think it is a good thing for
[1:43:46] you to ask uh so that uh he can share
[1:43:50] with us his
[1:43:51] experiences and it would be a blessing
[1:43:53] to our generation is that
[1:43:55] amen all right so I have a few a few for
[1:43:58] you here but before I do I I feel also
[1:44:00] inclin to ask you a little more
[1:44:03] about um what would you say to the
[1:44:08] critics of this message that would say
[1:44:10] brother bham is not the Fulfillment of
[1:44:13] Malachi 4 and some have even believed
[1:44:16] him to be the Fulfillment of Malachi 4
[1:44:18] for quite a few years and then they back
[1:44:20] away what would you say to that kind of
[1:44:23] thing nothing I was I would say nothing
[1:44:25] I'd mind my own business uh you have to
[1:44:28] have people like that you have to have
[1:44:29] the critics uh before you can hang in
[1:44:32] the Hall of Fame you first have to be
[1:44:34] crucified to the wall of critics so you
[1:44:37] need those people you need those people
[1:44:39] in your life we don't like it but you
[1:44:41] need it for your own character so before
[1:44:43] you can hang in the Hall of Fame you
[1:44:45] have to first be criticized yeah so in
[1:44:49] Australia you also have Believers of
[1:44:51] this message yes and you are one of them
[1:44:53] them yes amen and you're a pastor in
[1:44:54] this message yes sir so we are not alone
[1:44:57] the Believers are all over the world
[1:45:00] doesn't it bring a smile to your face I
[1:45:02] mean to me it always encourages me by
[1:45:04] the way I mean let's come to think of it
[1:45:07] that brother bham never went to every
[1:45:09] one of these countries but in every one
[1:45:12] of these countries all over the Earth
[1:45:14] there are
[1:45:15] witnesses witnesses that this message is
[1:45:18] true witnesses that Jesus Christ is
[1:45:20] alive witnesses that is that God changes
[1:45:23] that is the same yesterday today and
[1:45:24] forever that is a living God so we here
[1:45:27] interviewing a witness praise the Lord
[1:45:31] and so I have three questions from
[1:45:32] someone here as I wait for the others
[1:45:34] before we close he says what is the
[1:45:37] origin of the this is a a racial issue
[1:45:40] and he was wondering what's the origin
[1:45:42] of of the different I think we have I
[1:45:44] don't know how many races we have we
[1:45:45] have white we have black I don't really
[1:45:47] know whether it's black black cuz I'm
[1:45:49] not black but people call it black I
[1:45:51] think it's chocolate or or something
[1:45:52] like like that I'm pink you are pink
[1:45:54] you're not really white as well but
[1:45:56] people say white but anyways they say
[1:45:58] black and white and then I think there
[1:45:59] are also other resses so want what's the
[1:46:02] origin okay first thing I like to say is
[1:46:05] that if you're born again you're color
[1:46:06] blind you know you're we're all Brothers
[1:46:11] if we have a racial issue uh Adam was
[1:46:14] created an image of God and then God
[1:46:16] formed the body Out of the Dust and put
[1:46:19] that image of God into a body made of
[1:46:21] dust so if we got a racial issue is just
[1:46:24] a dust fight that's all it is yeah so uh
[1:46:28] I think if we're born again we're
[1:46:29] colorblind we're just brothers and
[1:46:31] sisters uh now the origin is ham sham
[1:46:34] and japeth they uh they were so I
[1:46:38] suggest to you to get myself out of
[1:46:40] trouble uh brother R said you are the
[1:46:43] color or you are what you are because of
[1:46:47] the the chemicals that are on the ground
[1:46:50] we the food grows so if we were to uh
[1:46:53] wrap a fence around Africa and no one
[1:46:55] could come and no one could go we would
[1:46:57] all end up
[1:46:58] black because of the soil if we were to
[1:47:01] go to uh Eastern Europe or if we were to
[1:47:05] go to Europe put a fence up that you
[1:47:07] can't come you can't go we would all
[1:47:09] look like Eskimos we would all look like
[1:47:12] European if we were to go to America
[1:47:15] wrap a fence around America then no one
[1:47:17] could come or no one could go we would
[1:47:18] all eventually end up looking like
[1:47:20] American Indians
[1:47:22] so it's the it's because of the location
[1:47:25] that that you live in now in the 20th
[1:47:27] century we we travel and we we uh inter
[1:47:30] marry and uh it doesn't work like that
[1:47:32] anymore we've hybrid the human race but
[1:47:35] uh the origin was hamam and japeth one
[1:47:38] went to a place called Africa one went
[1:47:40] to a place called uh Eastern a Asia and
[1:47:43] the other one went to Europe and even
[1:47:46] the Jews that went from because a Jew is
[1:47:50] a dark darker skinned person the ones
[1:47:53] that went to Europe after the second
[1:47:55] world war ended up White and the ones
[1:47:58] that came to Africa ended up black so
[1:48:01] it's just to prove not that we need
[1:48:03] proof but that's what the prophet said
[1:48:05] so as far as race is concerned it's just
[1:48:07] location location location yeah praise
[1:48:11] the Lord and then there's another
[1:48:13] question which says where where is the
[1:48:15] resurrected body of Jesus right now okay
[1:48:19] uh so I suggest to you
[1:48:24] brother randam said look brother R said
[1:48:25] returned back to being the pillar of
[1:48:27] fire so we we need metaphors we need
[1:48:31] words we need simuls to paint a mental
[1:48:34] picture so brother brandom said the body
[1:48:37] of Jesus Christ lays on an altar as a
[1:48:41] memorial that sin has been paid for so
[1:48:43] before you get too excited about that
[1:48:45] it's a metaphor and because in another
[1:48:48] place brother bam said it went back to
[1:48:50] being the pillar of fire in fact many
[1:48:52] places brother B said he went back to
[1:48:53] being the pillar of fire it's just that
[1:48:55] he knows now what it was to be a man so
[1:48:58] metaphorically he knows he's laying on
[1:49:01] the Altar interceding for us so the body
[1:49:04] of Jesus Christ one day you you are
[1:49:06] going to shake hands with Jesus because
[1:49:08] the Tabernacle of God will be with men
[1:49:11] but where is the body now honestly uh
[1:49:14] when there is a higher reality than this
[1:49:17] one there's a higher Dimension than this
[1:49:19] and you can't get your understanding
[1:49:23] even close to that other dimension so
[1:49:27] before we form clicks and groups and
[1:49:30] have church splits over where the body
[1:49:32] is it really doesn't matter as long as
[1:49:34] you're born again be born again it's
[1:49:36] it's not an issue unless you want it to
[1:49:39] be so if you think it's on an altar well
[1:49:41] okay it's on an altar if you think went
[1:49:43] back to being the P fire went back to
[1:49:44] being the P fire but let's let's forg
[1:49:46] good the sake let's not let's not fight
[1:49:48] about it yeah personally myself he went
[1:49:51] back to being the purifier
[1:49:54] because he said he said to Saul on the
[1:49:56] road to Damascus I am Jesus of Nazareth
[1:50:01] whom they are persecuted yeah thank you
[1:50:05] now number three when people die the
[1:50:09] body goes to the
[1:50:10] Grave where does the soul and the spirit
[1:50:13] go oh are they having a different
[1:50:16] destination and how I don't know these
[1:50:18] are several questions uh but I think you
[1:50:20] I hope you remember all of them so are
[1:50:22] they having different destinations and
[1:50:24] how will they gather together at the
[1:50:27] general Resurrection for the white
[1:50:29] Throne judgment will they go back to the
[1:50:32] real bodies from once they came okay uh
[1:50:36] no they won't go back to the real bodies
[1:50:38] because we have another body waiting for
[1:50:39] us I want to hand this body in slap one
[1:50:42] out and when I go to Rapture I don't
[1:50:44] want to see the thing again yeah I've
[1:50:47] got a new one waiting for me brother
[1:50:49] Bron went beyond the K of time and he
[1:50:50] saw people that were real that were
[1:50:52] tangible he put their hands around them
[1:50:54] uh your body and your soul uh without
[1:50:56] getting too uh philosophical about it
[1:50:59] because we have a proclivity to
[1:51:01] complicate things your body your soul
[1:51:04] and your spirit is the same
[1:51:06] thing uh the tent in the wilderness
[1:51:09] there was an outer tent then there was
[1:51:11] an inner tent and that one inner tent
[1:51:13] was divided into two so your spirit and
[1:51:16] your soul is is the same thing without
[1:51:19] getting too philosophical uh it goes to
[1:51:21] the same place M okay brother B said
[1:51:24] when Jesus died his body went to the
[1:51:25] Grave his soul went to God and His
[1:51:27] Spirit went to hell
[1:51:30] don't cause a church issue over that it
[1:51:33] makes perfect sense when you have a
[1:51:34] revelation of it uh if you don't have a
[1:51:36] revelation of it leave it alone put it
[1:51:39] on the shelf and God will show you yeah
[1:51:42] yeah because it has to be easy yeah it
[1:51:45] has to be simple it spiritual Revelation
[1:51:48] is like the transfer of spiritual common
[1:51:51] sense when God actually shows you you're
[1:51:54] like Oh I thought I already knew that
[1:51:57] you know brother BR says you have you
[1:51:59] will think oh I think I already knew
[1:52:01] that that's because you
[1:52:03] did because you know all things so if
[1:52:06] you're complicated and you can't put all
[1:52:07] the jigs or puzzles together leave it
[1:52:09] alone yeah you're going to cause a mess
[1:52:12] yeah yeah well uh I I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:52:17] going to close in a bit so if you have
[1:52:19] your question you'll come and take the
[1:52:21] microphone just come and stand there
[1:52:23] take the microphone ask your question um
[1:52:25] yes brother would you come yeah you can
[1:52:29] come up here feel free take the
[1:52:32] microphone and and ask you
[1:52:36] question yes God bless you God bless you
[1:52:38] my name is Moses m well I have a
[1:52:43] question but personally I got over it
[1:52:46] it's uh it's it's kind of a complex for
[1:52:50] the young ministers
[1:52:52] sometimes you go through a lot of things
[1:52:55] and personally the quote I had was that
[1:52:58] if you're a preacher and you come to the
[1:53:00] pulpit with a certain spirit it's the
[1:53:03] same Spirit you cast onto the people so
[1:53:06] there's a tendency of you looking at
[1:53:08] yourself and where you've been and you
[1:53:10] feel you're not worthy to preach like I
[1:53:13] I would like to ask you have you ever
[1:53:15] had such a time in your life when you
[1:53:19] felt so and how would you advise someone
[1:53:22] to overcome that thank you okay break
[1:53:25] that break that question down for me
[1:53:26] brother sorry okay um the question
[1:53:32] is what whatever preacher is he casts on
[1:53:35] to the people somehow the spirit that
[1:53:38] the preacher has okay okay like it will
[1:53:40] be projected to the people yeah so I
[1:53:43] think the first first of all can I stop
[1:53:45] there that shouldn't happen yeah if he's
[1:53:47] going to cast anything on the people it
[1:53:49] should be the word yeah yeah brother bam
[1:53:51] says sometimes we we pick up uh each
[1:53:53] other's spirit and that's not what we
[1:53:55] want we want the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:53:57] we we want we want the word yeah and so
[1:54:00] what was the other
[1:54:07] question aha aha oh yeah yeah yeah okay
[1:54:11] so uh complexes are every every young
[1:54:14] Minister has one to a thousand complexes
[1:54:16] it's it's normal yeah uh and the only
[1:54:19] way to overcome a complex is to do the
[1:54:21] opposite in uh Clinical Psychology it's
[1:54:24] called Uh voluntarily facing your own
[1:54:27] fears uh if if you have repented of your
[1:54:31] sins you have a Christian has no history
[1:54:36] a Christian only has a future a sinner
[1:54:39] has history a sinner has no future okay
[1:54:42] uh outside of specific things that
[1:54:46] brother brandham says like a pastor must
[1:54:48] marry a virgin okay so those things are
[1:54:51] specific the things that
[1:54:53] mentions specifically it's our privilege
[1:54:55] to be obedient to outside of that don't
[1:54:58] complicate it uh it just know that a
[1:55:01] Christian only has a future uh and to
[1:55:04] overcome a complex is you're going to
[1:55:05] have to do the opposite yeah so uh uh
[1:55:09] you can be preaching against something
[1:55:12] that you know you're struggling with
[1:55:14] well I don't care all I want is the
[1:55:17] word it's the word I could be sucking on
[1:55:20] a cigarette right now and saying don't
[1:55:25] smoke what are you going to believe the
[1:55:27] word the word says don't smoke so if
[1:55:29] you're going through an issue at the
[1:55:30] moment still preach the word because the
[1:55:32] word is the word don't compromise the
[1:55:34] word because of your complex I'm I'm
[1:55:36] being a gentleman right I'm not I'm
[1:55:38] saying if you have a complex about
[1:55:40] something in your past don't let that uh
[1:55:43] affect your future you never you'll
[1:55:45] never successfully move into your future
[1:55:48] trying to drag your past behind you uh
[1:55:51] uh the word is the word just preach the
[1:55:52] word Don't Preach your complex just
[1:55:54] preach the word yeah a Christian has no
[1:55:58] past but a Christian has only the future
[1:56:02] AA has no future he only has the history
[1:56:07] H those are powerful
[1:56:10] words
[1:56:11] amen and thank you brother Gary for
[1:56:14] answering that question and also did did
[1:56:16] it did it satisfy you brother okay and
[1:56:20] thank you brother MOSI for us asking
[1:56:22] that
[1:56:23] uh I think you get yourself a book
[1:56:25] brother M yeah so brother Josh I
[1:56:29] expected you by now to have brought
[1:56:31] those books so that brother M can get
[1:56:34] his copy right away I don't know how
[1:56:35] many I have so I think I'm remaining
[1:56:37] with two okay what advice do you have
[1:56:40] for someone struggling with faith uh uh
[1:56:44] and then the other question the other
[1:56:46] follow up question on that is how can I
[1:56:47] reconcile faith and
[1:56:50] reason and how do you you handle doubts
[1:56:53] and questions about faith okay uh if you
[1:56:57] are born again remember you must be born
[1:57:00] again if you're born again you
[1:57:02] automatically have
[1:57:04] faith doubt is always in the background
[1:57:07] because it has to be there to challenge
[1:57:11] Faith uh as I say uh uh
[1:57:15] Faith uh and uh
[1:57:18] confusion uh or trust and confusion have
[1:57:21] a symbiotic relation relationship you
[1:57:23] can only trust God when you are
[1:57:25] perfectly
[1:57:26] confused if you are confused it doesn't
[1:57:28] make you not a Christian it just means
[1:57:30] you don't understand you can only really
[1:57:33] have trust when you just don't know what
[1:57:35] to do it just does it doesn't mean that
[1:57:37] you're not a Christian and if you doubt
[1:57:40] it just means that old nature is having
[1:57:41] a voice just because it has something to
[1:57:43] say doesn't mean it needs an audience it
[1:57:46] it's our responsibility to silence the
[1:57:48] negative voices in our own heads uh
[1:57:51] doubt will always be there until the
[1:57:53] Rapture uh just because you doubt
[1:57:56] doesn't mean that you're not a Christian
[1:57:57] it just means you're in a
[1:57:59] battle it's it's a fight to The Bitter
[1:58:01] End and you make mistakes every day
[1:58:04] brother BR said you make mistakes every
[1:58:05] day until the Rapture you'll make
[1:58:06] mistakes just get used to it they're
[1:58:08] just obstacles to overcome
[1:58:14] yeah um I have another question here uh
[1:58:17] what would you say about a man who longs
[1:58:21] to hear God Speak speak directly to them
[1:58:23] let me say away from the church services
[1:58:27] I mean speaking through dreams and the
[1:58:30] many different ways God speaks and this
[1:58:33] condition is really lasting and this
[1:58:35] life is accompanied with
[1:58:37] prayer uh that is a that is something
[1:58:40] that every honest Christian wants yeah
[1:58:44] uh but what if you're the person that
[1:58:46] brother Braham says God will only use
[1:58:48] once in life and that's it what if what
[1:58:51] if what if that
[1:58:52] you uh every honest Christian wants a
[1:58:57] closer relationship with God in fact
[1:58:59] there would be a problem with your
[1:59:00] experience if you didn't want a closer
[1:59:02] relationship with God but don't let that
[1:59:04] drive you
[1:59:05] insane you've got to be comfortable in
[1:59:08] your own skin remember you must be born
[1:59:09] again I'm talking to people that are
[1:59:10] born again if you're born again you've
[1:59:12] got to be comfortable in your own skin
[1:59:13] and realize that God's going to use you
[1:59:15] the way that he designed you to be used
[1:59:18] uh not every vessel in the King's house
[1:59:19] is the same so maybe there's one brother
[1:59:22] that God is using all the time and he
[1:59:23] has all the gifts and he's got all the
[1:59:25] Supernatural and he's Dreaming Dreams
[1:59:27] every night and then you got this poor
[1:59:28] brother over here it seems like a piece
[1:59:30] of
[1:59:31] Driftwood uh and God only uses them once
[1:59:33] in his whole life well God designed them
[1:59:35] like that your job is not to beat
[1:59:38] yourself up over uh uh over thinking
[1:59:42] that you're lacking if you have a
[1:59:45] burning desire for more of God that's
[1:59:47] all you need because brother bam said
[1:59:50] God is not going to judge you by what
[1:59:51] you do God is going to judge you by what
[1:59:53] you want what you desire God will only
[1:59:55] judge you by your desire and everybody
[1:59:57] everybody everybody that's born again
[1:59:59] has a desire for more of God so uh I I
[2:00:03] know some brothers are more gifted than
[2:00:05] others and if you are a little bit
[2:00:06] jealous of that he you got an issue do
[2:00:08] you need to deal with you need to be
[2:00:11] comfortable in your own skin just make
[2:00:13] sure you're born again that's what just
[2:00:14] be born again because if you have Jesus
[2:00:17] you've got it all amen
[2:00:20] amen how do you you know you have the
[2:00:22] Holy
[2:00:23] Spirit Ah that's a beautiful question
[2:00:26] that is always asked especially at a
[2:00:27] youth camp yeah yeah okay so sometimes
[2:00:32] some people tick all the boxes and five
[2:00:35] years they turn their back on the
[2:00:36] message it's Case by case it's a very
[2:00:39] personal thing but we can uh a basic
[2:00:42] checklist one you believe the message of
[2:00:44] the hour is a very good indication you
[2:00:47] believe the message of the hour two you
[2:00:49] have the fruits of the spirit because if
[2:00:51] you have the spirit you have the fruits
[2:00:52] of the spirit and three is you have a
[2:00:54] burning desire to see Souls saved those
[2:00:56] are the three things because the man
[2:00:59] when a mark those that sigh and cry for
[2:01:00] the Abomination done in the city so you
[2:01:02] should have a desire uh you should not
[2:01:04] be happy that people are going to go to
[2:01:06] hell yeah knowing that people are going
[2:01:08] to go to hell but you have a desire that
[2:01:10] everybody be saved two you have the
[2:01:12] fruits of the spirit three you believe
[2:01:14] the message of the hour now if you got
[2:01:17] all those those three boxes ticked it's
[2:01:19] a good indication that you have what you
[2:01:22] say you've got that's a perfect answer
[2:01:24] as a pastor can say that is 100% perfect
[2:01:27] God bless you do I get a
[2:01:32] book I think you'll get a
[2:01:35] book well then I have another one here
[2:01:37] that says how do you get the Holy
[2:01:41] Spirit uh that is a good question listen
[2:01:45] uh
[2:01:46] friends God wants to give you the Holy
[2:01:50] Ghost more than you want to receive it
[2:01:53] that's what the prophet said so the
[2:01:55] quick answer is it's
[2:01:57] easy you got to make yourself available
[2:02:00] now a lot of people have the Holy Ghost
[2:02:03] and don't know they have that's what the
[2:02:04] prophet said a lot of people think they
[2:02:06] have the Holy Ghost and and they don't
[2:02:08] they don't so how do I know what's my
[2:02:10] life
[2:02:11] producing uh Eve had the right womb but
[2:02:16] she received the wrong seed and she
[2:02:18] brought forth a hybrid human hagga had
[2:02:22] the wrong womb received the right seed
[2:02:24] brought forth a wild man Sarah had the
[2:02:27] right womb she received the right seed
[2:02:29] but she had a bad attitude and she
[2:02:31] brought forth a natural man but Mary had
[2:02:34] the right womb the right seed the right
[2:02:36] attitude and she brought forth the
[2:02:39] word if if you're bride and you have the
[2:02:42] right attitude God wants to give you the
[2:02:44] Holy Ghost more than you want now Eve
[2:02:47] had a sensation hagga had a sensation
[2:02:50] Sarah had a sensation ation but Mary had
[2:02:53] no sensation when Jesus rose from the
[2:02:56] dead it was a silent Resurrection so if
[2:02:59] you haven't had a sensation it's got
[2:03:01] nothing to do with it it's what is your
[2:03:03] life producing don't forget God wants to
[2:03:06] give you the Holy Ghost more then you
[2:03:08] want to receive it so all you have to do
[2:03:10] is make yourself available have the
[2:03:12] right attitude and I tell you there's
[2:03:14] that's the winning formula and then
[2:03:16] don't go questioning yourself or judging
[2:03:18] Yourself by what you do right or what
[2:03:20] you do wrong because these things don't
[2:03:21] Define you what defines you is the word
[2:03:24] so you're going to make mistakes and if
[2:03:26] you if you have a sensation
[2:03:29] well I'm not impressed it it's just nice
[2:03:32] it's what does your life produce yeah so
[2:03:36] had you received the Holy Ghost my
[2:03:37] goodness you just got to ask for
[2:03:40] it you just got to want it yeah yeah
[2:03:43] yeah yeah you have to ask if you need
[2:03:45] God to fill you with the Holy Spirit you
[2:03:47] have to ask the Bible says ask and ye
[2:03:50] shall receive shall receive
[2:03:53] I think that's that's really the better
[2:03:54] way of answering that God bless you
[2:03:57] brother Gary and whoever asked that
[2:03:58] question you didn't put your name so no
[2:04:00] book for you if you had put your name
[2:04:02] then I would give have given you a book
[2:04:05] and so it says God bless you are there
[2:04:07] any specific scriptures or themes or
[2:04:10] principles that you emphasize in your
[2:04:11] ministry you didn't also put your names
[2:04:13] I don't know who you
[2:04:15] are uh well we don't want to we don't
[2:04:19] want to stop on a certain point you know
[2:04:22] the name of a denomination tells you
[2:04:24] where they stop believing uh the name of
[2:04:26] a camp in the message tells you where
[2:04:28] they stop believing yes so we want to
[2:04:30] believe the whole message uh if there's
[2:04:33] anything that I would emphasize is our
[2:04:36] position in Christ amen who we are
[2:04:39] because when she knows what it is that's
[2:04:41] when the ruption will take place so we
[2:04:43] we want to be careful to preach the
[2:04:44] whole word we want to be careful even to
[2:04:47] uh preach Divine Healing we want to uh
[2:04:50] when I was a child I did child things
[2:04:52] but then I grew up to be a man but if I
[2:04:54] drop something and I say if I drop a
[2:04:55] ball and it rolls under the table I get
[2:04:58] on my hands and knees like a little
[2:04:59] child and I go and get it yeah you know
[2:05:02] so there there's there's times where we
[2:05:04] preach the simple things there's times
[2:05:06] where we preach the Deep things but if
[2:05:08] there was an emphasis it would be who we
[2:05:11] are yeah but be very careful to preach
[2:05:14] the whole context of the message or else
[2:05:16] you end up with a click or a club and as
[2:05:19] soon as it happens uh it no longer
[2:05:21] becomes movement it becomes a monument
[2:05:23] and if it stagnates it's dead and that's
[2:05:26] the problem by the way that um every
[2:05:29] every Revival has had when people you
[2:05:33] know come in and they Camp they camp
[2:05:36] camping meaning the no more Revelations
[2:05:38] no no more God no more move movement of
[2:05:40] the spirit what we have received is what
[2:05:42] we have received no more and then by the
[2:05:45] BAM says when they denominate they die
[2:05:48] when they organize they die so uh in the
[2:05:51] message we we do not have any zeroing on
[2:05:53] on this on this idea that idea we eat
[2:05:56] the whole book so thank you so much for
[2:05:58] that Brother Gary and then this question
[2:06:00] says in case you come to church you hear
[2:06:03] your heart discerned from a to zed you
[2:06:06] call it Zed or
[2:06:08] Z either way uhhuh and and this happens
[2:06:13] from time to time and it's you perfectly
[2:06:16] how do you react to this in order not to
[2:06:18] miss it I don't understand the question
[2:06:21] I'm sorry so you come to church and you
[2:06:24] you hear your heart being discerned I
[2:06:25] would presume by the preaching of the
[2:06:27] word right and this happens from time to
[2:06:30] time but you kind of maybe she kind of
[2:06:32] feels she's missing it so what do you
[2:06:35] have to do say how do you react to this
[2:06:39] in order not to miss ah okay you need to
[2:06:43] come to church on a right frame of mind
[2:06:45] brother BR said you can't go home the
[2:06:47] same so you're either going to go home
[2:06:49] better or you're going to go home worse
[2:06:51] the devil heard that and said excellent
[2:06:53] I'll make sure they're in the bad frame
[2:06:55] of mind and if I can get them in a bad
[2:06:57] mood or bad frame of mind the devil said
[2:06:59] I will make sure they get to church
[2:07:01] because when they get to church with the
[2:07:03] right with the wrong frame of mind I
[2:07:04] know they're going to go home l a
[2:07:07] Christian so if you want to come to
[2:07:09] church and hear uh your life open up if
[2:07:14] you want to stand transparent before the
[2:07:16] Lord by the preaching of the word you
[2:07:18] just have to come to church in the right
[2:07:20] frame of mind you you have to come
[2:07:22] expecting to hear a personal message
[2:07:26] from the preacher not just in uh
[2:07:28] interesting information but a personal
[2:07:31] message from the preacher and then you
[2:07:32] can go home better but make no mistake
[2:07:35] about it you're not going to go home the
[2:07:36] same you're either going to be better or
[2:07:37] you're going to be worse and the devil
[2:07:38] heard the worst part and that's why
[2:07:40] brother Ram said the devil has he has a
[2:07:42] subtle instrument called the church so
[2:07:44] if the devil can get you in a bad mood
[2:07:46] he'll make sure you come to
[2:07:49] church because he knows you going to go
[2:07:52] home
[2:07:53] less than what you came so if you if you
[2:07:57] really want to hear uh your life being
[2:08:00] discerned by the preacher or Not by the
[2:08:02] preacher by the spirit of God but by the
[2:08:04] preaching of the word then you have to
[2:08:05] come to church expecting
[2:08:08] that and the question is when you have
[2:08:11] come you have come in the right attitude
[2:08:14] you've had your name being called you've
[2:08:15] been designed by the word what do you do
[2:08:18] in order not to miss your visitation
[2:08:21] relax
[2:08:22] don't try to be something uh don't try
[2:08:25] to be more spiritual than
[2:08:27] God just relax and be yourself uh you're
[2:08:31] going to get along with God a whole lot
[2:08:32] better just relax don't try to be
[2:08:34] spiritual don't go buing the biggest
[2:08:36] Bible just be comfortable in your own
[2:08:39] skin uh you hear the Lord speak to you
[2:08:41] say thank you Jesus and just be normal
[2:08:45] just be normal amen and brother bam said
[2:08:48] it will take care of itself amen amen
[2:08:52] and you know uh talking about that being
[2:08:55] normal and being yourself I think this
[2:08:57] is better to be said also at this moment
[2:09:00] you find that you know the Holy Spirit
[2:09:02] can move in a service and someone can be
[2:09:05] touched in a real special way you find
[2:09:07] someone maybe jumping up and shouting
[2:09:09] you find another one just crying you
[2:09:11] find another one you know some some
[2:09:14] people can even roll on the floor I mean
[2:09:16] we've seen these things happen and it's
[2:09:18] okay but then you who also you've you
[2:09:21] had your name being called you've had
[2:09:22] yourself being designed and you feel
[2:09:25] like you are less spiritual because
[2:09:26] you're not reacting the way the other
[2:09:28] person is
[2:09:29] reacting I think you have something to
[2:09:31] say about that yes uh brother R said
[2:09:33] when the Same Spirit hits me I jump and
[2:09:37] I shout when the Same Spirit hits sister
[2:09:39] MAA she sits down and she thinks about
[2:09:42] it yeah we are not here to conform to
[2:09:46] each other yeah yeah I know people that
[2:09:49] have come from noisy loud and animated
[2:09:51] churches and they have relocated to a
[2:09:54] quiet church and they through a process
[2:09:57] of time become quiet so that was not
[2:10:00] spiritual that was Conformity yeah it
[2:10:05] proved it because if that if that was
[2:10:07] real in the quiet Church they'd be
[2:10:09] jumping and
[2:10:10] chatting yeah I've seen people go from a
[2:10:12] quiet church and they go to a noisy
[2:10:15] church and through a process of time
[2:10:17] they end up noisy jumping animated
[2:10:19] people and I'm not impressed and I don't
[2:10:22] think it's spiritual I just think it's
[2:10:24] Conformity this a good healthy church
[2:10:26] will be a mix of loud and quiet yes if
[2:10:29] we all quiet we're conforming if we're
[2:10:32] all noisy we're conforming but if you
[2:10:34] can just relax and be comfortable and be
[2:10:36] who God designed you to be just be the
[2:10:38] man that God designed you to be don't
[2:10:40] worry about what other people are doing
[2:10:42] just worship God the way God designed
[2:10:44] you to worship that'll be a healthy
[2:10:45] Church you'll have some people shouting
[2:10:47] you'll have some people sitting you'll
[2:10:48] have some people running you'll have
[2:10:49] some people standing it just be
[2:10:51] everybody will just be comfortable in
[2:10:53] their own skin I tell you and that's a
[2:10:55] church that is alive
[2:10:58] amen oh your amens would have been
[2:11:00] louder than
[2:11:01] that we just love that answer God bless
[2:11:04] you and also it also goes to Ministry
[2:11:07] you know every Ministry is different and
[2:11:09] every Ministry is special I've had
[2:11:12] people comparing you know Minister
[2:11:14] ministers you know saying oh this one is
[2:11:16] the best preacher or the other one is
[2:11:18] the best or uh or or this and when
[2:11:20] ministers here that sometimes it gets to
[2:11:22] them and maybe you find especially
[2:11:23] younger ministers they want to try and
[2:11:26] act the way another Minister preaches if
[2:11:30] he's a favorite of the many so you find
[2:11:33] that there competition there MH you know
[2:11:35] uh if I could say something on that
[2:11:37] please uh the bride is not
[2:11:40] stupid uh the bride is Discerning as I
[2:11:43] said this morning both Prophet priest
[2:11:45] and King some preachers are just dead
[2:11:47] boring because they weren't called and
[2:11:50] the bride knows
[2:11:51] uh some preachers are very very
[2:11:53] interesting and they can preach for two
[2:11:55] hours and it only seem like one hour uh
[2:11:58] and you know it's spiritual because you
[2:12:01] were affected uh some preachers are is
[2:12:03] dead boring and nothing happens and you
[2:12:06] can't wait the whole congregation just
[2:12:08] knows that please this is just a public
[2:12:11] speech this is just uh this is this is
[2:12:14] not spiritual this is not Church the
[2:12:16] bride is not stupid so just because a
[2:12:18] brother says he's a preacher it's the
[2:12:20] bride will know if he is or
[2:12:22] not
[2:12:27] I just because a man has something to
[2:12:29] say doesn't mean it deserves an audience
[2:12:31] we're talking about the Bride of Jesus
[2:12:33] Christ you've got to handle her
[2:12:35] carefully yeah you can't manhandle her
[2:12:38] and just because you think I'm the man
[2:12:40] of the a well she's going to know
[2:12:42] whether you are or not yeah so yeah
[2:12:46] thank you thank you how many are being
[2:12:49] blessed I have the last question unless
[2:12:51] I have more it says and uh ah sister I'm
[2:12:55] going to give you a book and I know you
[2:12:58] like reading where are
[2:12:59] you uhuh you're get you're getting a
[2:13:02] book how can you summarize the message
[2:13:04] of the hour it's a good question yeah
[2:13:07] can I summarize the message of the hour
[2:13:10] it is Jesus Christ in bright
[2:13:13] form
[2:13:15] amen God had a purpose and that was to
[2:13:18] bring forth a people liken unto himself
[2:13:21] God sent us a prophet so that God could
[2:13:23] bring forth the people likened unto
[2:13:26] himself and I think this is what you
[2:13:27] preached also this Sunday morning amen
[2:13:29] that was really lovely really lovely God
[2:13:32] bless you uh so the the summary of the
[2:13:35] message of the hour is Jesus Christ in
[2:13:37] bright form and you notice brother bam
[2:13:39] said never at time do I bring a message
[2:13:41] so that I can have a following or some
[2:13:43] organization or some church but that
[2:13:45] people should have a personal
[2:13:46] relationship with Jesus Christ amen so
[2:13:49] it is uh a people that are transformed
[2:13:52] into the image of Christ Jesus Christ in
[2:13:54] bright form that's the summary for you
[2:13:57] sister Rachel uh I have three more
[2:14:00] papers and and I think uh I'm about to
[2:14:02] close if you have any question you
[2:14:03] better bring it now else I would say no
[2:14:05] more questions because I want to close
[2:14:07] is it proper for me as a Believer to go
[2:14:11] and preach in any Pentecostal church
[2:14:13] when given a privilege to do so by
[2:14:16] themselves like when you are invited in
[2:14:18] their fellowship and what do you need to
[2:14:20] bear in mind before you go ah lovely
[2:14:24] question yes go and preach yes yes yes
[2:14:28] uh be a gentlemen uh don't compromise
[2:14:31] the word we can accommodate without
[2:14:33] compromise uh uh if you've been invited
[2:14:36] to go and preach go preach yeah yeah
[2:14:40] preach uh baptism in jesus' name don't
[2:14:42] go don't go throwing in the seven
[2:14:44] everything because they don't understand
[2:14:46] it anyway i' I'd introduce serpent seed
[2:14:49] or uh baptism in jesus' name or
[2:14:51] something you know whatever the Spirit
[2:14:53] uh uh guides you or leads you but if
[2:14:55] you've got an invitation to go preach at
[2:14:57] a Pentecostal Church run for it yeah
[2:15:00] especially if you're called to preach
[2:15:02] and and be a gentleman
[2:15:04] yes um that's a good one uh how do you
[2:15:09] get
[2:15:11] Faith be born
[2:15:14] again I think that answer is just
[2:15:19] enough and I think
[2:15:21] Whoever has asked this question can can
[2:15:23] I say something you go back to the
[2:15:24] morning service yes please are you
[2:15:26] probably if you're are born again and
[2:15:28] you feel like you don't have faith you
[2:15:30] probably have misunderstood yourself
[2:15:33] you're probably trying to reach out
[2:15:35] where you shouldn't be uh brother Bram
[2:15:37] said sir in the audience I see you're
[2:15:39] battling with cigarettes you've been
[2:15:40] trying to give up cigarettes he said
[2:15:42] that's because you're trying too
[2:15:45] hard faith is so close to you it's a
[2:15:48] part of you if you've been born again
[2:15:51] it's a part of your spirit uh it's like
[2:15:54] I don't have to go put a shirt on
[2:15:56] brother R said I'm already wearing a
[2:15:57] shirt so it's not is no is no should be
[2:16:00] no question how do I get Faith if you're
[2:16:02] born again you got it it's just now the
[2:16:06] hard part is simplifying it and what we
[2:16:09] say in Australia dumbing down to to to
[2:16:12] grab something because it's God hiding
[2:16:14] in Simplicity it's not faith is not
[2:16:16] intellectual faith is not something it's
[2:16:18] not an emotional leap into the dark
[2:16:22] faith is not an emotional leap into the
[2:16:24] dark faith is tangible it's it's part of
[2:16:26] you you you you have it if you if you
[2:16:29] just knew that it was so simple and so
[2:16:31] close you'd probably be more successful
[2:16:34] with it amen and
[2:16:39] um any more with any questions cuz after
[2:16:42] this no more
[2:16:44] questions I think uh these young people
[2:16:47] are impressed with the way you answering
[2:16:48] those questions because these are the
[2:16:51] most questions we have ever answered on
[2:16:52] an
[2:16:53] interview so it says how do you
[2:16:56] interpret scripture and what roles does
[2:16:58] it play in shaping our
[2:17:01] faith okay uh we have no right to
[2:17:04] interpret
[2:17:05] scripture uh we we have the message
[2:17:09] which gives us a template do you know
[2:17:10] what a template is a template yeah and
[2:17:13] then we can take that template and we
[2:17:15] can put that over other scriptures like
[2:17:17] brother R said a tree represents a man
[2:17:20] uh green is a new beginning blue is the
[2:17:23] color of Fellowship uh he gives us he
[2:17:25] gives us a lot of details uh on what
[2:17:28] things are which we can transfer to
[2:17:30] another place as long as we remember
[2:17:32] that context is King so we're not
[2:17:35] interpreting scripture brother Bram has
[2:17:37] already done that uh all we're doing is
[2:17:39] we are taking the template of what the
[2:17:41] prophet said and applying it to uh
[2:17:43] places where brother bam never spoke of
[2:17:46] uh uh and as far as interpreting the
[2:17:48] word it's been interpreted yeah
[2:17:51] yeah so we are interpreting nothing we
[2:17:54] are only taking the template and
[2:17:55] applying it on situations yes so so that
[2:17:58] we can so that we
[2:18:00] can so that we can uh get to the place
[2:18:05] where we have it in our spirit that
[2:18:09] can't be explained with words I tell you
[2:18:12] that this message and I've been speaking
[2:18:13] to preachers around the world this
[2:18:15] message has got to a place where you
[2:18:18] cannot a preacher cannot fully paint
[2:18:20] that picture in the minds of the people
[2:18:21] like he used to because the word is so
[2:18:23] rich we really don't have those words so
[2:18:26] that's why the if the congregation comes
[2:18:28] to church and a right frame of mind you
[2:18:30] you you can hear in the
[2:18:32] silence you you you can you can uh you
[2:18:37] can go where words can't take you amen
[2:18:40] yeah
[2:18:41] amen how do you be delivered when the
[2:18:45] devil has a claim on
[2:18:47] you what how do you get delivered
[2:18:51] if the devil has a claim on you okay so
[2:18:53] if you don't have the faith to do it
[2:18:55] yourself see your pastor and get him to
[2:18:58] pray for you amen cuz we cast out Devils
[2:19:02] amen
[2:19:04] amen and if you are here and you as you
[2:19:08] as that question you might as well come
[2:19:11] here uh while we are finishing we will
[2:19:14] cast out those demons which are
[2:19:16] bothering
[2:19:17] you can you be filled with the Holy
[2:19:19] Ghost and you are still still struggling
[2:19:21] with weakness is like prayerlessness
[2:19:23] yes yes full of the Holy Ghost and
[2:19:26] struggling with personal desire full of
[2:19:28] the Holy Ghost Paul said oh Wretched Man
[2:19:31] that I am full of the Holy Ghost and
[2:19:33] still doing the wrong thing yes yes yes
[2:19:38] yes yeah but it should get better as you
[2:19:41] mature in the Lord those things should
[2:19:43] start dropping off and I think that
[2:19:46] brings us to the last question the last
[2:19:48] last last one the last last last last
[2:19:50] one
[2:19:51] so how do you uh uh connect or reconcile
[2:19:58] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[2:20:01] adoption I think it would be a good
[2:20:04] thing if you can be able to uh paint a
[2:20:06] little picture for the people to
[2:20:08] understand uh the baptism of the Holy
[2:20:10] Ghost is the gift the gift adoption is
[2:20:13] the giver uh the baptism of the Holy
[2:20:16] Ghost so if I give brother Buzz a gift
[2:20:18] of mine he hasn't got me but if I become
[2:20:21] brother Buzz that's adoption so if I
[2:20:24] have the Holy Ghost I'm now I'm now a
[2:20:26] new creature I've been birthed I'm here
[2:20:29] you can't get rid of me I'm here here's
[2:20:32] the baby but the baby grows it can't
[2:20:34] stay in Pediatrics there's something in
[2:20:37] the body that will just continue to grow
[2:20:40] it continues to grow until finally God
[2:20:42] can see that he can trust you with
[2:20:44] anything he can throw at you and when
[2:20:46] God can trust you with that the adoption
[2:20:48] is because you see a baby is elective
[2:20:51] but adoption is
[2:20:54] chosen you you choose who you adopt so
[2:20:58] when the father can see you're at a
[2:21:00] position where you can run the family
[2:21:01] business yourself he says hey don't talk
[2:21:04] to me no more he you him so your the
[2:21:07] Born Again experience and the adoption
[2:21:09] brother B said is two different things
[2:21:12] two different things so when you are
[2:21:13] born again you have entered into a
[2:21:16] spiritual life the real you is now on
[2:21:18] the scene but in in a baby form and now
[2:21:21] it's a matter of growing in the Holy
[2:21:23] Ghost where those things that used to
[2:21:25] trouble you don't trouble you anymore
[2:21:27] and you're getting that those things are
[2:21:29] just dropping away and then when finally
[2:21:31] the father can see that he can trust you
[2:21:33] with anything he can throw at
[2:21:35] you it's here ye him that that's the
[2:21:38] adoption and you an adopted child still
[2:21:43] coping with personal issues but God can
[2:21:47] see that he can trust you with it and
[2:21:48] you're not you're not going to use that
[2:21:50] as an excuse use you're going to
[2:21:52] overcome
[2:21:53] it
[2:21:55] amen to those of you who have been
[2:21:57] listening to the ministry of Brother
[2:21:59] Gary Walker this weekend I would advise
[2:22:01] you to go listen to these messages the
[2:22:05] adoption baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:22:07] brother bham preached that I think two
[2:22:09] two messages in that uh it is the rising
[2:22:13] of the sun these are titles I'm throwing
[2:22:16] out to you go and listen to
[2:22:18] them um the seed shall not be here with
[2:22:21] a shark Christ the mystery Christ is the
[2:22:23] mystery of God revealed go listen to
[2:22:25] these messages and you will not remain
[2:22:27] the same how many have been blessed by
[2:22:30] the minister Brother Gary this weekend

[2:22:52] make something that will bless everyone

[2:22:57] be hard not because of anything but
[2:23:00] because you stand with this message the
[2:23:02] way brother bham presented it praise
[2:23:04] Lord and uh would you please pray over

[2:23:09] remarks okay so if I could do the
[2:23:12] benediction uh uh so been a privilege

[2:24:35] privilege to be here privilege to be
[2:24:37] amongst the uh the people of God who
[2:24:40] have uh been numbered in this late hour
[2:24:44] it's the uh Pinnacle time to be alive
[2:24:48] it's the hardest season to be in but
[2:24:49] it's the most wonderful to see and to be
[2:24:51] in and it's just a privilege to come
[2:24:53] with Brother Gary and to meet the people
[2:24:57] of this place and I have said it a few
[2:25:01] times but I say it because I mean it I
[2:25:03] believe you are a very rich people rich
[2:25:06] in character rich in in uh I would say
[2:25:10] rich in uh spiritual wealth as well and
[2:25:14] I mean that and it's a it's a it's an
[2:25:17] honor to to be supporting anything that
[2:25:20] is serving God in his body at this time
[2:25:24] I think we are well taught and we know
[2:25:28] that the only way we can tangibly serve
[2:25:32] our
[2:25:33] wonderful gracious heavenly father is to
[2:25:37] serve his wife which is present on this
[2:25:40] Earth at this time we all have our ups
[2:25:44] we all have our downs but in our heart
[2:25:47] of hearts in our soul of souls we
[2:25:49] identify
[2:25:51] with the word of Truth and it is life to
[2:25:55] us and we don't just believe it but we
[2:26:02] love it and as Pastor Gary has said many
[2:26:08] times uh you are you're not going to go
[2:26:11] to Heaven by believing this message
[2:26:15] you're going to go to glory and be in
[2:26:18] the Rapture by being this
[2:26:22] message amen so I'm thankful to be
[2:26:26] numbered with Brothers like Pastor Gary
[2:26:29] Pastor buzz and all the Brethren out
[2:26:32] there amen just being a pastor doesn't
[2:26:35] put you on a Pinal it doesn't elate you
[2:26:39] I'm I'm a firm believer if we all take
[2:26:41] our position then the whole system works
[2:26:45] well y like a clock with many different
[2:26:48] parts it is
[2:26:51] effective and functional when everybody
[2:26:56] uh understands their position which I
[2:26:58] will confess is something that evolves
[2:27:01] over time and is happy to support the
[2:27:05] body in that manner amen because I I'm
[2:27:11] I'm a believer that
[2:27:14] uh that if we could really see into the
[2:27:17] Unseen knowing that the Unseen FM is
[2:27:22] more real than the scene
[2:27:25] then Brother Gary said the Lord said to
[2:27:28] him you would volunteer for this and uh
[2:27:32] we have a privilege to have breath in
[2:27:34] our bodies and pulsation in our hearts
[2:27:38] Amen to serve the body knowing as it's
[2:27:43] been said recently that very soon we we
[2:27:47] believe the raptures very soon or we
[2:27:50] believe the going of the Bride which is
[2:27:52] the rapture is very
[2:27:54] soon culminates or closes in our
[2:27:59] opportunity to serve him in the richness
[2:28:03] of worship that we have in the season
[2:28:06] that we are living amen so thank you for
[2:28:10] the opportunity to be here to support
[2:28:12] Brother Gary amen I believe he's a true
[2:28:15] man of God I don't lift him up but I
[2:28:17] believe God has given him the Grace to
[2:28:20] go through the things that he has gone
[2:28:23] through for the benefit of the body of
[2:28:26] Christ not just locally but worldwide
[2:28:30] I've had the privilege to sit under his
[2:28:33] ministry for many years now amen and we
[2:28:38] don't lift up a man but I do believe we
[2:28:42] should acknowledge what God has got in
[2:28:44] place and the prophet of God said that
[2:28:48] the ministry the Pastor the ministers
[2:28:51] the ministry demands
[2:28:54] respect amen and as we put these little
[2:28:57] things in place and we we we fall into
[2:29:04] the the picture as Jesus wants us to
[2:29:07] fall into the picture then everything
[2:29:10] works everything works so I don't know
[2:29:13] why I said all that but just to say that
[2:29:15] it's a privilege to be part of this
[2:29:18] little opportunity knowing that God puts
[2:29:21] us through things and as the pastor has
[2:29:25] preached uh very firmly at times he said
[2:29:28] remember God will put you through things
[2:29:32] for the benefit of someone
[2:29:34] else which I think is a very amazing
[2:29:37] thing to think of in our lives because
[2:29:40] sometimes things don't kind of work out
[2:29:44] in a way that we kind of plan and maybe
[2:29:49] we kind of think maybe we should chew to
[2:29:51] our Lord a little bit in a couple of
[2:29:53] areas but knowing that God puts us
[2:29:55] through things that somehow the body is
[2:29:58] going to need at some
[2:30:01] time and so I I thank the Lord to be
[2:30:06] part of the uh the ministry in this end
[2:30:10] time amen knowing that it is most
[2:30:16] definite that before we open our mouth
[2:30:20] to preach a
[2:30:22] message we need to live a
[2:30:25] message amen because
[2:30:28] then it will carry weight and the life
[2:30:34] that you carry can transfer because it
[2:30:37] has a reality behind it so in saying all
[2:30:40] that uh I'll just give over to Pastor
[2:30:43] Gary now but I'll just say it's a lot
[2:30:46] more thing God bless you all it's a
[2:30:48] privilege to be serving the lord and the
[2:30:52] body in this hour at whatever time and
[2:30:55] in whatever capacity
[2:30:59] and brother Gary is guilty of saying
[2:31:03] many times I've encouraged him to rest
[2:31:06] at certain times and brother Gary is
[2:31:09] just determined to serve the body he
[2:31:11] said I will rest in the
[2:31:14] Millennium so it just it's
[2:31:17] uh I think there's time for rest too I I
[2:31:20] think that's healthy but his
[2:31:22] determination is to God has given him
[2:31:26] what he's given him and it's for the
[2:31:27] benefit of the body of Christ and I I
[2:31:30] believe as brother said before anyone
[2:31:34] needs to uh before he can say that it's
[2:31:37] witnessed in his life and and in your
[2:31:39] lives too amen and may we be a blessing
[2:31:42] to each other and encourage each other
[2:31:45] right up until the final moment amen so
[2:31:48] I'll give over to Pastor God bless
[2:31:51] you God bless you don't don't don't
[2:31:53] don't uh forget that not everything that
[2:31:55] you go through is for you like Tim said
[2:31:57] eh Somebody's Watching You someone's
[2:31:59] watching to see what your reaction to an
[2:32:02] action is and it might be uh that God is
[2:32:05] using you as a as an advertisement to
[2:32:08] what Christianity is so not everything
[2:32:11] that you go through is for you don't
[2:32:14] feel sorry for yourself everything works
[2:32:16] together for the good amen amen
[2:32:20] so love each other and pray for one
[2:32:21] another don't forget uh your
[2:32:23] relationship with God is indicative of
[2:32:25] your relationship with each other so
[2:32:27] love one another genuinely love one
[2:32:29] another appreciate one another pray for
[2:32:31] one another say nice things about one
[2:32:33] another uh brother bam said and then God
