[41:53] now of whom the whole family in heaven
[41:55] and earth is
[42:02] named that he would Grant you according
[42:04] to the riches of his glory to be
[42:06] strengthened with might by his spirit in
[42:08] the inner
[42:18] man that Christ May dwell in your hearts
[42:21] by faith that ye being rooted and
[42:23] grounded in
[42:25] love
[42:34] be able to comprehend with All Saints
[42:36] what is the breadth and length and depth
[42:39] and
[42:52] height and to know the love of Christ
[42:55] which passes knowledge that you may be
[42:57] filled with all the fullness of
[43:10] God Amen let's bow our heads
[43:13] together precious Heavenly

[43:25] faith to GA to gather around the word of
[43:30] God to encourage one another in the
[43:35] faith to dig deeper in this word than
[43:37] ever
[43:38] [Music]
[43:41] before that we might know the depths of
[43:43] Your
[43:46] Love Lord I just commit myself unto
[43:50] you I pray that you would have the
[43:52] preeminence in the
[43:55] service Lord help me to get myself out
[43:57] of the
[43:59] way and help the hearer to get
[44:01] themselves out of the
[44:04] way that we might be lifted in Heavenly
[44:06] places in Christ
[44:10] Jesus that we might hear what the spirit
[44:12] is speaking to the
[44:15] church bless the reading of the word
[44:19] Lord bless the hearing of
[44:22] it we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ
[44:29] amen amen you can have your
[44:34] seats you might feel like a small group
[44:36] here
[44:39] tonight but this feels Just Like Home to
[44:43] me this is about the size of our church
[44:46] back at
[44:48] home so I'll preach to you just like I'm
[44:51] preaching at
[44:54] home
[44:56] so I want to speak tonight on the love
[44:58] of
[45:01] God but I I won't be able to express it
[45:04] in the way that I want
[45:07] to and let me tell you
[45:11] why it started about a year before I was
[45:16] [Music]
[45:17] born my father and mother received the
[45:20] message about a year before I was
[45:24] born
[45:28] and both of them received it and
[45:29] believed it with their whole
[45:33] Hearts so I was born into a home where
[45:36] my parents belied this
[45:40] message so I grew up as a young boy
[45:43] knowing the power of
[45:47] God knowing that God was a
[45:50] Healer knowing that God was a
[45:54] provider and when I was was about 9
[45:56] years
[45:57] old I gave my heart to the
[46:01] Lord was baptized in the name of Jesus
[46:04] Christ and he filled me with his Holy
[46:08] Spirit and when I was about 24 years
[46:12] old I began to preach the
[46:15] gospel and now I'm 38 years
[46:20] old so that was almost 30 years ago when
[46:23] I was
[46:24] baptized
[46:27] and I've read my Bible from the
[46:28] beginning to
[46:31] end many books I've read many many
[46:36] times and I've listened to every message
[46:38] that brother brandham
[46:41] preached many of the messages I've
[46:43] listened to many many
[46:47] times but in all of
[46:49] that living a my whole life Desiring to
[46:53] know more of
[46:54] God
[46:58] in all of those
[47:00] years I have never yet found How deep
[47:03] the love of God
[47:06] goes I have never yet found how wide it
[47:11] is I have never yet found how high it
[47:15] is as the songwriter
[47:18] said if we with ink were to fill the
[47:24] ocean and what the SK of parchment
[47:29] made if every stock on Earth was a
[47:36] quill and every man was a scribed by
[47:40] [Music]
[47:41] trade to write the love of God
[47:46] above it would drain the oceans
[47:48] [Music]
[47:50] dry nor could the scroll contain the
[47:53] whole of
[47:54] it
[47:57] though it was stretched from Sky to
[48:02] Sky so all that I can do
[48:06] tonight is just share a little bit of
[48:08] the love of God that I
[48:12] know even though I feel like I barely
[48:14] scratch the surface of
[48:18] it let me share with you what God's love
[48:22] means to
[48:24] me amen the Bible says in Hebrews
[48:27] chapter
[48:30] 6 in verse one it says therefore leaving
[48:33] the principles of the doctrine of God
[48:35] you can turn there if you want BR okay
[48:37] Hebrews chapter 6 and verse
[48:54] one
[48:58] let us go on to Perfection did you read
[49:00] the whole verse yes okay praise the
[49:04] Lorden not laying again the foundation
[49:07] of repentance from dead works and of
[49:08] Faith towards god of the doctrine of
[49:10] baptisms and of the laying on of hands
[49:12] and of the resurrection of the dead and
[49:14] of Eternal judgment and verse three says
[49:17] and this will we do if God permits read
[49:19] all the way to verse
[49:24] three
[49:49] so the Bible says let us go on to
[49:54] Perfection we have laid the
[49:57] foundation we' received the word of
[50:00] God we believed
[50:02] it we were baptized in the name of Jesus
[50:06] Christ we've been filled with the Holy
[50:08] Ghost now let us go on to
[50:12] Perfection and Perfection means
[50:16] completion let us press into the
[50:19] completion of God's desire for our
[50:24] lives
[50:26] in order to go on to
[50:28] Perfection we had to receive the
[50:30] Perfection of the
[50:33] word in order to go into
[50:36] completion we needed a complete word of
[50:41] God and that's why God said he would
[50:43] ReStore in this
[50:46] day and he has truly
[50:49] restored in 1 Corinthians 13 and verse
[50:54] 8
[50:56] we're going to read verse 8 to
[51:00] 10 the Bible says charity never faileth
[51:03] but whether there be prophecies they
[51:06] shall fail whether there be tongues they
[51:09] shall cease whether there be knowledge
[51:11] it shall vanish away for we know in part
[51:14] and we prophesy in part but when that
[51:17] which is perfect is come then that which
[51:19] is in part shall be done
[51:24] away
[51:41] [Music]
[51:45] so when that which is perfect is
[51:48] come or when that which is complete is
[51:53] come then that which is in part shall be
[51:55] done away
[51:58] with God the Bible says God once winked
[52:01] at the ignorance of
[52:06] man because the perfect word had not yet
[52:10] come but now that the fullness of the
[52:13] word is
[52:15] here it is our responsibility to walk in
[52:20] it when you're building a
[52:23] building you need many
[52:27] supports you need many scaffold
[52:31] systems you need many
[52:34] ladders you need many temporary
[52:39] structures but when the completion of
[52:41] the building is
[52:44] come all that is temporary must be
[52:46] pulled
[52:49] away so that the beauty of the complete
[52:54] work can be
[52:57] revealed and that is what God is doing
[52:59] in this
[53:01] age he's revealing the Perfection of his
[53:05] work he's revealing his complete
[53:09] work he's revealing his
[53:14] Masterpiece the the word com the word
[53:17] perfection in the
[53:19] Bible means
[53:22] complete of full age like a man com to
[53:26] full
[53:28] age it means brought to its end and
[53:33] finished it means wanting nothing
[53:36] necessary to be
[53:38] [Music]
[53:41] complete and that's what we want to
[53:42] enter
[53:44] into because that's what God has given
[53:47] us in this
[53:49] day when that which is perfect is
[53:52] come then that which is in part shall be
[53:54] done away
[53:57] so the building of the Lord is what
[53:58] we're talking
[54:00] about and the building of the Lord is
[54:03] like a
[54:06] pyramid the py pyramid has many
[54:09] [Music]
[54:11] corners at the bottom there's many
[54:16] cornerstones but there is only one Chief
[54:22] Cornerstone that is the one that goes on
[54:24] the top
[54:27] the one that holds everything
[54:30] together and the building cannot be
[54:34] complete and the building cannot be
[54:37] strong until that Chief Cornerstone is
[54:39] in
[54:42] place in Ephesians chapter 2 and verse
[54:46] 20 it says we are built upon the
[54:48] foundation of the Apostles and
[54:54] Prophets Jesus Christ
[54:57] himself being the Chief
[55:01] Cornerstone so this message coming down
[55:03] in this
[55:06] hour this Capstone message of God's
[55:10] [Music]
[55:12] work had to be Jesus Christ
[55:16] himself and it was Christ revealed in
[55:22] his in Daniel chapter 2 in verse
[55:27] 44 speaking about the dream that
[55:30] Nebuchadnezzar
[55:32] had there was a great
[55:35] image it had a head of
[55:37] gold and shoulders of
[55:41] silver and a torso of
[55:43] [Music]
[55:45] brass and legs of
[55:48] iron and Toes of iron mixed with
[55:54] clay
[55:56] and and and we know that the Bible
[55:59] says when Daniel interpreted the
[56:02] vision that these were the kingdoms of
[56:05] the
[56:07] Gentiles and we've come down to the time
[56:09] of the iron mixed with
[56:13] Clay but when the kingdoms of the
[56:15] Gentiles came to their
[56:18] end the Bible says that in the days of
[56:22] these
[56:23] Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a
[56:28] kingdom which shall never be
[56:32] destroyed and the kingdom shall not be
[56:34] left to other
[56:36] people but it shall break in pieces and
[56:39] consume all of these
[56:44] Kingdom and it shall stand
[56:47] forever and that kingdom was the stone
[56:50] that was heun out without
[56:53] hand
[56:55] and it came down and crashed into the
[56:59] image but then it grew into a great
[57:03] mountain and that great mountain is the
[57:05] kingdom of
[57:08] God and the Capstone of that
[57:11] mountain is Jesus
[57:14] Christ the Bible says it filled the
[57:16] whole
[57:19] world that's the city whose Builder and
[57:21] maker is
[57:23] God that's the place we're going
[57:27] to and the Bible says the Kingdom of
[57:29] Heaven is within
[57:32] you so that Kingdom begins from the
[57:37] inside that kingdom is perfect
[57:40] love and the Holy Ghost is perfect
[57:44] love and that which is inside of you is
[57:46] perfect
[57:48] love and you can't get there without
[57:51] perfect
[57:53] love all perfect
[57:57] love in Revelations 21 and verse
[58:01] 2 it says I John saw the holy
[58:06] city the New
[58:09] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[58:12] Heaven it was prepared as a bride
[58:15] adorned for her
[58:19] husand what was it it was
[58:23] love it's speaking about love
[58:26] relationship this kingdom is a kingdom
[58:28] of the love of
[58:30] God it's the kingdom of the word made
[58:33] flesh in the
[58:36] people a kingdom where God and man has
[58:38] become
[58:40] one and God is
[58:43] love we know that because that's what
[58:46] the Bible
[58:47] says and we've experienced
[58:52] it so it came down from God out of
[58:54] heaven
[58:55] [Music]
[58:57] prepare it as a bride Adorn for
[59:01] husband and in verse n it says and there
[59:05] came unto me one of the Seven
[59:08] Angels saying come hither I will show
[59:11] Thee the bride the Lamb's
[59:16] wife and where did the angel take
[59:19] him he carried him away in the spirit to
[59:22] a great high
[59:23] mountain
[59:26] and he showed me that great
[59:29] City the holy
[59:32] Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from
[59:36] God and I saw no Temple therein I saw no
[59:41] Temple therein inside of
[59:46] it the city had no need of the
[59:50] sun neither of the moon to shine in
[59:53] it for the glory of God did lighten
[59:59] him and the lamb is the light
[1:00:04] thereof
[1:00:07] amen Luke
[1:00:09] 17 Luke chapter 12 and verse
[1:00:13] 32 this is the Chief Cornerstone
[1:00:19] speaking we might we might feel like the
[1:00:21] kingdom of God is so far away sometimes
[1:00:27] we might feel like it's such a great
[1:00:31] thing like how could we ever attain
[1:00:35] it but Jesus
[1:00:37] said fear not little
[1:00:41] flock for it is your father's good
[1:00:46] pleasure to give you the
[1:00:48] Kingdom so fear not because it's his
[1:00:52] good
[1:00:53] pleasure it speaks of a a
[1:00:57] relationship it speaks of a love that
[1:00:59] God had for
[1:01:01] you he wasn't giving you the kingdom
[1:01:03] because he had
[1:01:06] to he wasn't giving you the kingdom
[1:01:08] because you bought
[1:01:11] it he's given you the kingdom because
[1:01:13] it's his good
[1:01:16] pleasure he came down and paid the
[1:01:19] price because it was his good
[1:01:23] pleasure the Bible is according to the
[1:01:25] pleasure of his
[1:01:28] will it's the pleasure of his
[1:01:33] will Jesus said again in Matthew chapter
[1:01:40] 22 speaking to the man who asked him
[1:01:43] Lord which is the greatest
[1:01:48] commandment and Jesus said unto him Thou
[1:01:51] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[1:01:54] heart with all th soul with all th
[1:02:01] mind so the greatest commandment was
[1:02:05] love this is the first and great
[1:02:11] commandment and the second is like unto
[1:02:15] it oh I like how he added in the second
[1:02:18] greatest
[1:02:20] command lest we should be
[1:02:23] deceived
[1:02:25] and think that we can pretend to have
[1:02:26] the Holy
[1:02:30] Ghost and then turn away from our
[1:02:36] neighbor but he was reminding
[1:02:39] us like he said to his
[1:02:42] disciples by this shall all men know
[1:02:45] that you are my
[1:02:49] disciples that you have love one for
[1:02:53] another so says the second is like unto
[1:02:57] him Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:03:02] thyself so on these two
[1:03:06] Commandments hang all the law and the
[1:03:12] prophets the
[1:03:15] foundation amen so so the the this the
[1:03:19] building of
[1:03:21] God is built upon the foundation
[1:03:25] of
[1:03:27] love and it's capped
[1:03:30] off with
[1:03:35] love so though we are at the
[1:03:39] top living in the day when that which is
[1:03:41] perfect has
[1:03:44] come the foundation must be
[1:03:48] sure the only way we can reach the
[1:03:52] Perfection of
[1:03:53] Christ
[1:03:56] the only way we can reach all that God
[1:03:58] has for
[1:04:01] us is if we start with the sure
[1:04:06] Foundation otherwise the building will
[1:04:11] collapse and Jesus spoke to this leodan
[1:04:16] church and and and he reminded Us of
[1:04:19] three
[1:04:20] things he said buy of me these three
[1:04:23] things
[1:04:26] and the first one was gold tried in the
[1:04:31] fire which we know is a Christlike
[1:04:36] character as the Bible says in Romans 8
[1:04:38] verse
[1:04:41] 29 whom he did Forno them he did
[1:04:45] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:04:47] image of his
[1:04:50] son that he might be the firstborn among
[1:04:53] many brethren
[1:04:57] so the same character that was in
[1:05:00] Christ God wants to mold in
[1:05:04] you and it's something that you must
[1:05:06] purchase from
[1:05:09] him so it's something that's going to
[1:05:11] cost you
[1:05:14] something and white rment that thou
[1:05:16] mayest be
[1:05:18] clothed which we know white rapen is the
[1:05:23] righteousness
[1:05:24] the righteousness of the word
[1:05:27] himself Bible says in Revelations
[1:05:32] 1978 let us be glad and
[1:05:36] rejoice and let's give honor to
[1:05:39] him for the marriage of the Lamb has
[1:05:43] come and his wife has made herself
[1:05:47] ready she made herself
[1:05:50] ready there were some
[1:05:53] preparations there was some
[1:05:56] labors and to her was
[1:06:00] granted that she should be arrayed in
[1:06:03] fine
[1:06:05] linen clean and
[1:06:08] white for the fine linen is the
[1:06:11] righteousness of the
[1:06:14] Saints and our righteousness is not our
[1:06:18] own but he took on sin for
[1:06:21] [Music]
[1:06:23] us that we might take on his
[1:06:28] righteousness it was given to her that
[1:06:30] she could put it
[1:06:33] on it was granted to
[1:06:36] her and and we know that the well
[1:06:40] brother brandom says in in present stage
[1:06:41] of my
[1:06:46] Ministry he says I hope he will Crown my
[1:06:49] Ministry with
[1:06:53] this
[1:06:54] of letting me take the clothes of the
[1:06:59] word and dress his bride in the cloth of
[1:07:03] the
[1:07:05] word and for his
[1:07:08] righteousness in the message of shamed
[1:07:10] in
[1:07:15] 1965 he said just the perfect
[1:07:19] message back to the
[1:07:22] word this was the Angel speaking to
[1:07:24] brother
[1:07:25] Branham when he was searching for a
[1:07:29] scripture Lord where does my Ministry
[1:07:33] fit show me where I am in the
[1:07:36] word and God showed him this
[1:07:39] scripture he was the
[1:07:42] elaser sent to find a bride for
[1:07:46] Isaac and he had been sent to find a
[1:07:48] bride for
[1:07:50] Christ to lay out the cloth of the word
[1:07:55] that she might be clothed
[1:07:58] in he says that's a Duty or he says go
[1:08:01] get that
[1:08:05] bride that's a
[1:08:07] duty that's what I'm here
[1:08:10] for that's what I'm trying to
[1:08:12] do is call out a
[1:08:15] bride so when you heard this
[1:08:19] message and you were able to receive
[1:08:22] it and you able to believe
[1:08:25] it it's because God was calling
[1:08:28] [Music]
[1:08:29] you because you were a part of the
[1:08:33] Bride you heard his love calling
[1:08:36] you and there was something in you to
[1:08:38] respond to
[1:08:40] that the Bible says we love
[1:08:44] him because he first loved
[1:08:47] us we could only answer the
[1:08:51] call because he was calling us
[1:08:54] he was calling our
[1:08:56] name he was speaking our
[1:08:59] language there was something about it
[1:09:01] that gripped
[1:09:03] us there was something about it that we
[1:09:05] couldn't turn
[1:09:07] away there was something about it that
[1:09:09] it just rang true with the word of
[1:09:13] God something that you've been searching
[1:09:15] for your whole
[1:09:18] life and now here it
[1:09:20] was the love of God to you
[1:09:26] in the Bible also says by eyes have that
[1:09:28] you may
[1:09:32] see so that so we had to have a
[1:09:35] different Vision in order to
[1:09:40] see and we know that God sent this end
[1:09:42] time
[1:09:45] message under the anointing of an
[1:09:49] eagle it wasn't the anointing of a
[1:09:52] lion it was wasn't the anointing of an
[1:09:55] ox it wasn't the anointing of a
[1:09:58] man all of those anointings were
[1:10:03] Earthbound they could only see so
[1:10:06] far they could only see to the next
[1:10:10] Corner they could only see to the trees
[1:10:12] up
[1:10:14] ahead they could only see up to the
[1:10:16] buildings that were in front of
[1:10:19] them but God sent this message under an
[1:10:21] eagle anointing
[1:10:25] an anointing that would lift us up above
[1:10:29] everything that not only could we see
[1:10:32] where we are
[1:10:34] today but we could see where we came
[1:10:38] from and we could see all the way to the
[1:10:41] end we could see the
[1:10:44] destination we could see what it was
[1:10:46] going to take to get
[1:10:49] there we could see where all the food
[1:10:51] was
[1:10:52] laying
[1:10:54] and we could just come down and get a
[1:10:55] hold of whatever we had need
[1:10:59] of that's the anointing we're living
[1:11:01] under
[1:11:03] today where wherever whatever we have
[1:11:05] need
[1:11:07] of whatever PR promise we need to lay a
[1:11:10] hold of
[1:11:11] today we can see it's laying in the word
[1:11:14] for
[1:11:15] us why because it's God's love to his
[1:11:20] bride he doesn't ever want his bride to
[1:11:22] be lacking
[1:11:25] he doesn't ever want her to go
[1:11:28] without whatever the trial may
[1:11:32] be whatever circumstances might look
[1:11:36] like yet you're not looking at what's
[1:11:38] right around
[1:11:40] you but you can already see the Finish
[1:11:44] Line you know he's taking you home to
[1:11:48] Glory you know he's clothing you in his
[1:11:51] word you know he's bringing you to
[1:11:55] completion so it doesn't matter what the
[1:11:57] storm is like around
[1:12:00] you you're just going to SAR right
[1:12:02] through
[1:12:02] [Music]
[1:12:04] it because that's the promise of
[1:12:08] God he said I will never leave
[1:12:11] you nor forsake you right to the end of
[1:12:15] the
[1:12:17] world and you can see
[1:12:19] it because he's given you the eyes of an
[1:12:22] evil
[1:12:24] so we know that this is the Capstone
[1:12:28] message that the message is
[1:12:31] Christ because he's the Chief
[1:12:34] Cornerstone and we know that when that
[1:12:36] which is perfect is
[1:12:39] come that it had to be
[1:12:42] Christ so we know he's the one that
[1:12:44] holds everything
[1:12:46] together we know he's the one in the
[1:12:48] midst of his
[1:12:51] church we know the opening of the seals
[1:12:53] was the revealing of
[1:12:57] Christ the Capstone coming
[1:13:00] down Christ The Mystery of God
[1:13:05] revealed and he's come down to complete
[1:13:07] his
[1:13:09] work he's come down to perfect his
[1:13:13] bride so let us go on to
[1:13:17] Perfection this with this Capstone
[1:13:22] message if we just keep on feeding on
[1:13:24] the word of
[1:13:27] God it will take us all the way
[1:13:30] there because that's the purpose it was
[1:13:35] sent Zechariah
[1:13:38] 4:7 who art thou oh great
[1:13:42] [Music]
[1:13:43] Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt
[1:13:46] become a
[1:13:49] plain and he shall bring forth The
[1:13:51] Headstone thereof
[1:13:55] with shoutings crying Grace Grace
[1:14:01] unto so this message came down for his
[1:14:06] bride he sends the message to his bride
[1:14:09] with
[1:14:12] Grace he doesn't come down with
[1:14:17] judgment he doesn't come down to yell at
[1:14:21] her he doesn't come down to push her
[1:14:26] around he doesn't come down to say woman
[1:14:28] get in your
[1:14:32] place but he comes down with crying of
[1:14:34] Grace
[1:14:38] Grace because she is in
[1:14:42] position she knows her
[1:14:45] place she knows that she is called to
[1:14:48] take the
[1:14:50] book and to eat the book
[1:14:54] she knows she's called to receive the
[1:14:56] fullness of the
[1:14:58] word that the word might have the
[1:15:03] pinces and because she is a
[1:15:06] wife she recognizes the headship of
[1:15:09] Christ
[1:15:12] Lord and she gives him the
[1:15:17] prominences so when he brings down his
[1:15:19] perfect message his
[1:15:22] Capstone
[1:15:25] it comes down with crys of Grace
[1:15:29] Grace because it's a love
[1:15:33] relationship because there's a love that
[1:15:35] he loves his
[1:15:38] bride and she loves
[1:15:41] him the Bible says that that day ye
[1:15:44] shall
[1:15:47] know that I am in the father and the
[1:15:49] father in
[1:15:52] me but that's not
[1:15:54] all you won't just know who the father
[1:15:58] is you won't just know who the son
[1:16:02] is you won't just know that there are
[1:16:04] one in the
[1:16:06] same but you also know that he is in
[1:16:11] you and not only will you know that he
[1:16:14] is in
[1:16:16] you not only will you know that the Holy
[1:16:18] Ghost is Christ in
[1:16:22] you but you will also know your
[1:16:26] place you will also know that you are in
[1:16:30] him for he said that day you'll know
[1:16:33] that I am in
[1:16:36] you and you are in
[1:16:39] me so we've come to that
[1:16:42] hour where we can see who we
[1:16:45] are we recognize our
[1:16:48] place we know we are the bride of
[1:16:51] Christ and and brother brandham
[1:16:54] said he said the whole thing is God and
[1:16:57] man
[1:17:00] one God's
[1:17:03] plan was God in man
[1:17:06] one that he might have his prominences
[1:17:09] in a
[1:17:12] people the first
[1:17:15] place the
[1:17:17] headship like a bridegroom and his
[1:17:22] bride amen are you thankful to be living
[1:17:25] in that
[1:17:28] day in the message what is the Holy
[1:17:31] Ghost given
[1:17:34] for don't you want to know why God gave
[1:17:36] you the Holy
[1:17:40] Ghost says what is the Holy
[1:17:43] Ghost it's God in
[1:17:47] you what's it
[1:17:49] for to continue his work among his
[1:17:57] so he's saying God wants to work through
[1:18:00] you just like it's a husband working
[1:18:03] through the
[1:18:04] wife that when they've truly become
[1:18:08] one they've been
[1:18:11] married but that's not all of
[1:18:13] it the the wife gets to know the
[1:18:17] husband and the husband the
[1:18:20] wife until these two become one
[1:18:23] the Bible
[1:18:25] says that's Ephesians chapter
[1:18:29] 5 or might be chapter 4 I'm not for sure
[1:18:32] so read
[1:18:35] both but but the Bible
[1:18:38] says it it it says these two shall
[1:18:40] become one
[1:18:43] flesh the man and the woman when they
[1:18:46] are truly
[1:18:47] one when they've truly been
[1:18:51] wed when they truly enter into that
[1:18:55] Union but Paul says I'm speaking a
[1:19:01] mystery I'm really speaking about Christ
[1:19:03] in the
[1:19:05] church these two shall be one
[1:19:09] flesh Paul says I'm speaking about
[1:19:11] Christ in the
[1:19:14] church that these two would be
[1:19:18] one so the whole plan of
[1:19:21] God rate from Genesis to
[1:19:26] Revelation R from the fall of
[1:19:29] Man to the Redemption of the
[1:19:33] Cross to the Rapture of the
[1:19:36] bride all of it God's
[1:19:39] plan and the whole plan was that God and
[1:19:42] man might become
[1:19:44] [Music]
[1:19:46] one the word United with
[1:19:50] man the bride and the bridegroom become
[1:19:54] one that's the completion of
[1:19:58] it brother BR says to bring his church
[1:20:03] together we're still talking about what
[1:20:05] the Holy Ghost was given
[1:20:08] for to bring the church to a place in
[1:20:11] this
[1:20:13] day this
[1:20:16] day are
[1:20:19] they Beyond far beyond the Lutheran meth
[1:20:22] me and
[1:20:26] Pentecostal whatever denomination you
[1:20:29] might have come out
[1:20:31] of it could have been one even of our
[1:20:33] own
[1:20:36] making but God called you out of
[1:20:39] that he's called you to somewhere
[1:20:42] higher he's called you to go
[1:20:45] further and you heard his
[1:20:48] call because you are the
[1:20:51] bride he says called you out of there
[1:20:54] into a
[1:20:56] place to a place of
[1:20:59] adoption and the rapturing
[1:21:04] grace Ephesians 1 and verse
[1:21:08] 10 that in the dispensation of the
[1:21:10] fullness of
[1:21:14] times are we living in the fullness of
[1:21:18] times are we're living in the end
[1:21:21] times that he might gather together in
[1:21:24] one all things in
[1:21:30] Christ both which are in heaven and
[1:21:32] which are on
[1:21:34] earth even in
[1:21:38] him amen didn't he
[1:21:41] say that at that day you shall
[1:21:44] know that I'm in the father and the
[1:21:48] father and I am in you and you are in me
[1:21:54] so the message to his people is a
[1:21:56] message of
[1:21:59] Grace it was a message of rapture and
[1:22:05] Grace he doesn't want us to
[1:22:08] fear he doesn't want us to be
[1:22:11] afraid because we are his
[1:22:15] bride so he wants to take all of the
[1:22:17] fear out of
[1:22:19] us in Romans 8 verse1 15
[1:22:35] Bible says you have not received the
[1:22:37] spirit of bondage again to
[1:22:44] fear but you have received the spirit of
[1:22:47] adoption whereby we cry ABA
[1:22:51] father
[1:22:54] [Music]
[1:22:58] so if you are still afraid of that which
[1:23:00] is around
[1:23:03] you you you came to
[1:23:07] God and you believed his
[1:23:10] word and you were baptized in the name
[1:23:12] of Jesus
[1:23:14] Christ and he filled you with his holy
[1:23:19] ghost but maybe you're still worried
[1:23:21] about how you're going to make enough
[1:23:27] money maybe you're still worried about
[1:23:30] if sickness might
[1:23:33] come don't
[1:23:35] worry just keep pressing into the word
[1:23:38] of
[1:23:40] God because the spirit that he has sent
[1:23:45] us will not bring you to
[1:23:48] fear it will bring you out of
[1:23:51] fear it will bring you to a place where
[1:23:53] you are united with the
[1:23:57] word and when you become one with the
[1:24:01] word our all fear will
[1:24:05] vanish Hallelujah because God's Capstone
[1:24:09] in your
[1:24:11] life is
[1:24:14] Christ is perfect
[1:24:17] love and perfect love casts out all
[1:24:21] fear
[1:24:24] so just keep trusting in
[1:24:26] Him say Lord I I don't know what is
[1:24:29] going to happen
[1:24:32] tomorrow but I know that you are in
[1:24:35] control
[1:24:36] [Music]
[1:24:40] tomorrow brother Bram says in the first
[1:24:46] seal he says and when John started to
[1:24:49] write those other seven
[1:24:51] Thunders
[1:24:53] he said don't write
[1:24:55] it he had been commissioned to write
[1:24:58] everything he
[1:25:01] seen But when these seven Thunders over
[1:25:04] in Revelations 10
[1:25:09] uttered he said don't write them at
[1:25:13] all they are
[1:25:16] Mysteries we don't know what they are
[1:25:19] yet this was in the first seal
[1:25:23] but my opinion they'll be revealed right
[1:25:28] away and they
[1:25:30] were because we know in the days of the
[1:25:32] voice of the seventh
[1:25:35] angel when he began to
[1:25:37] sound all the mysteries of God were
[1:25:42] finished and he says and when it do when
[1:25:45] it
[1:25:46] does it'll give faith for that rapturing
[1:25:51] Grace
[1:25:53] for that church to move
[1:25:57] out so that message that was revealed
[1:25:59] under those seven
[1:26:03] Thunders was a message of
[1:26:07] completion there couldn't be anything
[1:26:08] else after
[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:11] that because all the Mysteries were
[1:26:14] finished so what was given under those
[1:26:19] seals had to be the Capstone message
[1:26:25] had to be
[1:26:27] Christ to bring the church into
[1:26:32] Christ to make known his full attention
[1:26:35] in his full intentions and his
[1:26:41] love all things must come up into
[1:26:47] Christ Ephesians
[1:26:51] 4:15 it says but speaking the truth in
[1:26:57] love may grow up into him in all
[1:27:03] things which is the
[1:27:05] head even
[1:27:08] Christ so where is he bringing us
[1:27:11] to he's bringing us to
[1:27:15] Christ so we have a sure
[1:27:19] Foundation 2 Timothy 2:19
[1:27:24] says nevertheless the foundation of God
[1:27:27] standeth
[1:27:31] sure having this
[1:27:34] seal the Lord knoweth them that are
[1:27:38] his hallelujah amen and let everyone
[1:27:42] that nameth the name of Christ depart
[1:27:45] from
[1:27:49] iniquity Ephesians 28 and9
[1:27:53] for by Grace you are saved through
[1:27:57] faith and not of
[1:28:01] yourselves it is the gift of
[1:28:04] God not of Works lest any man should
[1:28:09] boast so so this love that we speaking
[1:28:12] of entering
[1:28:15] into when Jesus when when in Revelations
[1:28:18] it says buy of me gold try in the
[1:28:21] fire
[1:28:23] in white rment that thou mayest be
[1:28:27] clothed and isab that thou mayest
[1:28:31] see we're not speaking about works that
[1:28:33] we have to
[1:28:36] do it's not going to cost you
[1:28:40] works but it's going to cost you
[1:28:41] surrender to
[1:28:44] him because he is your
[1:28:47] headship so we must give all
[1:28:51] diligence to make our calling and
[1:28:53] election
[1:28:55] sure to let the word wash
[1:28:59] us that's the
[1:29:02] labor is to stay under that washing of
[1:29:05] the
[1:29:07] word to let it continually bring us into
[1:29:12] line because it's him doing the
[1:29:17] work he can only work as long as you
[1:29:19] allow
[1:29:20] him
[1:29:23] it's just like a husband and a
[1:29:26] wife he can only bring her into His
[1:29:32] Image just as much as she'll
[1:29:36] allow if she wants to live her own
[1:29:40] life she wants to have her own
[1:29:43] career and she wants to chase her own
[1:29:47] dreams then these two shall never become
[1:29:49] one
[1:29:50] flesh
[1:29:52] that's right and if you want to chase
[1:29:54] after the things of the
[1:29:57] world when the Holy Spirit is trying to
[1:29:59] wash
[1:30:01] you and God is saying don't do
[1:30:04] that God is trying to wash something out
[1:30:07] of your
[1:30:08] life but because of the lust of the
[1:30:11] flesh the lust of the
[1:30:14] eyes because of the deceitfulness of
[1:30:17] riches it keeps attracting our
[1:30:20] attention
[1:30:22] we can never come into His
[1:30:25] Image we can never become one with
[1:30:28] him so we have to labor to be under his
[1:30:32] head we have to say Amen to every
[1:30:36] word when we say Amen to the
[1:30:39] word we're not just saying it with our
[1:30:43] lips but we say it with our
[1:30:46] lives because it's not what you
[1:30:49] say it's how you live
[1:30:52] and we can say whatever we
[1:30:55] want we can profess whatever we
[1:30:58] want but it's our life that proves out
[1:31:01] who we
[1:31:03] are so if you say you believe
[1:31:07] something say it with your
[1:31:10] life say it with all that you
[1:31:13] are say it in every decision that you
[1:31:18] make always put Christ
[1:31:20] first
[1:31:23] but don't do it just out of
[1:31:26] works it must be done out of
[1:31:30] love and you can only do it out of
[1:31:33] love when you've been born again by the
[1:31:36] holy
[1:31:38] spirit because then it's Jesus on the
[1:31:43] inside working towards the
[1:31:47] outside changing us from glory to
[1:31:50] glory
[1:31:53] clothing you in the word of
[1:31:57] God
[1:31:59] hallelujah second Corinthians or second
[1:32:01] Timothy 1
[1:32:04] ver9 who has saved
[1:32:07] us and called us with a holy
[1:32:10] calling not according to our
[1:32:14] works but according to his own purpose
[1:32:17] and
[1:32:20] Grace which was was given us in Jesus
[1:32:23] Christ before the world
[1:32:26] began so you've been called with a
[1:32:31] purpose God didn't just fill you with
[1:32:33] the Holy Ghost for no
[1:32:37] reason he didn't fill you and say that's
[1:32:39] the end of
[1:32:42] it but he filled you so that he might be
[1:32:44] your
[1:32:47] guide he filled you that he might lead
[1:32:49] you to the fullness of the word
[1:32:54] Bible says if that the spirit that same
[1:32:57] spirit that raised up Christ Jesus from
[1:32:59] the
[1:33:03] dead if it dwells in
[1:33:05] you it shall also Quicken your mortal
[1:33:10] body so the only way that God can
[1:33:12] Quicken
[1:33:14] you is from the inside
[1:33:18] out and the quickening of the word
[1:33:23] the
[1:33:24] quickening it means to bring us in line
[1:33:27] with the word of
[1:33:32] God to Quicken your mortal
[1:33:36] body means to bring it in line with the
[1:33:38] word of
[1:33:41] God to bring it in line day after
[1:33:46] day to wash you day by
[1:33:50] day until you're a bride without spot or
[1:33:56] wrinkle the Holy Ghost is the quickening
[1:33:58] power of
[1:34:01] God and it keeps quickening and
[1:34:06] quickening until one day the very fiber
[1:34:08] of this Mortal body is
[1:34:13] changed because the Bible says that this
[1:34:15] Mortal must put on
[1:34:20] immortality in this corruption must put
[1:34:22] on
[1:34:25] incorruption why does it have to do
[1:34:29] that because the word said it
[1:34:32] well because you're his
[1:34:34] [Applause]
[1:34:35] bride and he is
[1:34:39] perfect he is not
[1:34:43] mortal but he is
[1:34:45] Immortal he is
[1:34:48] eternal so if the husband is immortal
[1:34:52] and the husband is
[1:34:54] eternal and the husband is
[1:34:57] perfect he would never leave his bride
[1:35:00] in
[1:35:03] imperfection he would never leave his
[1:35:05] bride in
[1:35:07] corruption so he says fear not little
[1:35:12] FL fear not my
[1:35:15] bride for it's the father's Good
[1:35:19] Will to give you the kingdom
[1:35:22] to give you the fullness of his
[1:35:26] word amen hallelujah so we are called
[1:35:30] according to his
[1:35:33] purpose Ephesians 1 verse
[1:35:37] 9 it says having made known unto us the
[1:35:39] mystery of his
[1:35:42] will according to his good
[1:35:46] pleasure he made known his mystery to
[1:35:50] us he he didn't do it because he had
[1:35:53] to he didn't sit back with his arms
[1:35:58] folded say oh my they're just not
[1:36:00] getting
[1:36:01] it oh if they just try a little bit
[1:36:04] harder oh if they just work a little
[1:36:08] harder but no it was his good
[1:36:12] pleasure it was always his desire to
[1:36:15] reveal his
[1:36:17] will it was always his will to reveal
[1:36:19] the
[1:36:20] Mysteries
[1:36:22] he knew you would need the
[1:36:25] mysteries in order to receive a body
[1:36:30] change the only reason he didn't give
[1:36:32] the Mysteries
[1:36:35] before was because the word that was
[1:36:38] hidden underneath
[1:36:40] there it would have produced a
[1:36:45] Rapture but it wasn't time for a Rapture
[1:36:50] yet because you weren't here
[1:36:53] yet and before the foundation of the
[1:36:57] world you were called according to his
[1:37:01] purpose so it had to wait until you were
[1:37:06] here it had to wait till the last one
[1:37:08] was
[1:37:10] here that he might reveal his
[1:37:14] Mysteries so that then the time that it
[1:37:16] would take to produce a
[1:37:20] rapture
[1:37:21] would be just the right amount of
[1:37:25] time so that the last
[1:37:28] one the last member of the
[1:37:32] Bride the last one that he knew would
[1:37:34] receive
[1:37:36] it be here on the
[1:37:38] earth because he's not leaving one
[1:37:43] behind he told us the parable of the 100
[1:37:48] Chief how that if he counted them
[1:37:51] and there was only
[1:37:53] 99 and one was
[1:37:56] missing he would leave the
[1:37:59] 99 and he would go and find the
[1:38:01] one so God had to wait till the last one
[1:38:04] was
[1:38:07] here because he's not leaving one
[1:38:11] behind said don't worry
[1:38:13] tonight he's not leaving you
[1:38:16] behind but he gave you his
[1:38:18] [Applause]
[1:38:19] word because you are coming
[1:38:22] home you're a part of his
[1:38:25] bride you're here
[1:38:28] tonight because you're a part of
[1:38:31] him you're receiving this
[1:38:34] message because you're a part of
[1:38:37] him you receive this
[1:38:40] message because you could receive
[1:38:43] it and only his bride can
[1:38:48] receive so you've got it tonight
[1:38:52] so don't worry little
[1:38:54] FL it's the father's Good Will to give
[1:38:57] you the
[1:38:59] kingd so just keep feeding on the word
[1:39:01] of
[1:39:03] God keep laying a hold on the
[1:39:06] promis keep pressing through every
[1:39:10] trial because he's building a faith
[1:39:13] within
[1:39:15] you as you patiently
[1:39:18] endure he doesn't just want you to know
[1:39:21] him as
[1:39:23] God but he wants you to know him as
[1:39:27] husband he wants a close relationship
[1:39:29] with
[1:39:31] you he wants to he wants you to know
[1:39:34] him he he allows sickness into your
[1:39:39] life because he wants you to know that
[1:39:42] he's
[1:39:44] a sometimes it can look so
[1:39:48] bad sometimes it looks impossible
[1:39:52] but he wants it to look
[1:39:55] impossible he wants you to know
[1:39:58] that that the only one that could
[1:40:00] possibly get you
[1:40:02] out is God
[1:40:05] himself because he wants you to know
[1:40:07] that he did
[1:40:10] it he wants you to know that he is the
[1:40:12] one that
[1:40:14] came he wants you to know that he's the
[1:40:17] one revealing
[1:40:19] to w oh it's a personal
[1:40:25] relationship it's not just God in his
[1:40:28] church it's not just God in
[1:40:31] heaven it's not just God in
[1:40:34] Christ but it's God in
[1:40:37] you oh he wants to be so real in every
[1:40:40] one of our
[1:40:42] Lives until we're just walking with him
[1:40:46] every till every thought is the is a
[1:40:49] word thought
[1:40:52] tell every decision that we
[1:40:54] make it's a word
[1:40:57] decision oh every time we get up in the
[1:41:01] morning he wants us to walk according to
[1:41:03] his
[1:41:04] will until these two become one
[1:41:09] flesh all the union of Christ in his
[1:41:14] blood God and man
[1:41:18] becoming praise the Lord
[1:41:21] how are we doing for time
[1:41:23] Brothers all right praise the
[1:41:26] Lord hallelujah we've laid a good
[1:41:32] foundation and he's made known unto us
[1:41:34] the mystery of his
[1:41:38] will according to his good pleasure that
[1:41:41] he
[1:41:45] purp he made this decision
[1:41:49] himself he didn't come to us and say
[1:41:51] what do you
[1:41:54] think would you like to be a part of the
[1:41:58] Bride in ourselves we would say oh we're
[1:42:01] not
[1:42:03] worthy how could we possibly be a part
[1:42:06] of the of
[1:42:08] Christ but he already made this decision
[1:42:14] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:42:16] fullness of
[1:42:19] times as we are he
[1:42:21] read that he might gather together in
[1:42:24] one all things in
[1:42:28] Christ both which are in heaven and
[1:42:30] which are on
[1:42:31] earth even in
[1:42:34] him in whom we have obtained an
[1:42:39] inheritance so in Christ Jesus you will
[1:42:42] find your
[1:42:45] inheritance in Christ Jesus you will
[1:42:47] find all that belongs to
[1:42:49] you
[1:42:51] when you are married to
[1:42:54] him when you are united with
[1:42:57] him you will find that everything that
[1:42:59] belongs to
[1:43:01] him it also belongs to
[1:43:04] you the Bible says we are more than
[1:43:09] conquerors through Christ who loved
[1:43:12] us because he already
[1:43:16] conquered and he brought it home to his
[1:43:19] wife and he says this now belongs to
[1:43:23] you oh you need
[1:43:26] healing he brings it home he says this
[1:43:28] belongs to you you need
[1:43:32] Deliverance he says this now belongs to
[1:43:35] you you need
[1:43:37] provision he brings it home and he says
[1:43:40] this now belongs to
[1:43:42] you because you are his
[1:43:45] bride and he loves
[1:43:47] you so everything that he did it was for
[1:43:50] you
[1:43:53] just like everything that a man does is
[1:43:54] for his
[1:43:57] wife when a young man sees a young
[1:44:01] woman and he falls in love with
[1:44:04] her no other girl means anything to
[1:44:09] him it doesn't matter how beautiful the
[1:44:11] other ones might
[1:44:12] be there's something that's happen
[1:44:15] between him and this
[1:44:16] [Applause]
[1:44:19] special oh you might look at other
[1:44:21] churches and say they're so
[1:44:25] beautiful you might look at other ones
[1:44:27] and say Lord it looks like they have so
[1:44:31] much they have so much
[1:44:34] money they have so much
[1:44:36] education they are just this big
[1:44:38] International
[1:44:41] group that even the governments have
[1:44:45] recognized like in Ethiopia our
[1:44:48] brother they said oh if you don't have
[1:44:50] this certain Paper you can't preach
[1:44:54] here even even the world has recognized
[1:44:57] these certain
[1:45:00] churches and we look at them say oh
[1:45:02] they're so
[1:45:04] great but God says what does that
[1:45:08] matter I'm not looking at
[1:45:10] them I don't got no eyes for
[1:45:14] them how do you know that God doesn't
[1:45:17] have eyes for
[1:45:19] that because he didn't give his word to
[1:45:22] them he gave his word to
[1:45:27] you Hallelujah glory to God
[1:45:31] Amen GL Glory
[1:45:34] Glory sorry my screen just keeps jumping
[1:45:37] around maybe it's getting excited
[1:45:41] too hallelujah hallelujah all of
[1:45:44] creation's
[1:45:46] groaning waiting for the manifestation
[1:45:49] of sons of God
[1:45:53] there's a little bit of creation
[1:45:55] somewhere in here there's a little bit
[1:45:57] of God's creation somewhere in
[1:46:00] [Music]
[1:46:01] here so it must be jumping around
[1:46:19] too
[1:46:21] where are
[1:46:24] we we in him we obtained an
[1:46:27] [Music]
[1:46:29] inheritance
[1:46:32] predestinated that means God made sure
[1:46:34] it would
[1:46:37] happen because he forew
[1:46:40] you he could predestinate because of his
[1:46:43] forn
[1:46:47] knowledge because he knew you would
[1:46:49] receive it
[1:46:52] so he could work out
[1:46:56] events so that his word would come by
[1:46:58] your
[1:47:03] way predestinated according to the
[1:47:05] purpose of
[1:47:10] him him who worketh all things after the
[1:47:13] counsel of his own
[1:47:19] will brother brandham said in the
[1:47:21] message
[1:47:23] adoption he said God's will is a
[1:47:28] mystery and if we stop
[1:47:31] there we think oh I guess I'll never
[1:47:33] know the will of
[1:47:36] God but he says each man has to seek out
[1:47:39] the will of God his
[1:47:47] herself God's mystery
[1:47:51] so it's mysterious to you who you
[1:47:56] are but it's not God's will for it to
[1:47:59] stay
[1:48:02] a so dig into the word of
[1:48:07] God find out who you
[1:48:10] are if you're wondering about whether or
[1:48:12] not God loves
[1:48:16] you take into the word of
[1:48:18] God so can find out how much he loves
[1:48:25] you Colossians 2 and verse
[1:48:29] 6 you have therefore received Christ
[1:48:32] Jesus the
[1:48:35] Lord so walk ye in
[1:48:40] him oh we got the message brother
[1:48:44] Sten so walk in
[1:48:47] him walk with him every day
[1:48:52] rooted and built up in
[1:48:57] him and established in the
[1:49:03] faith as you have been
[1:49:05] taught abounding therein with
[1:49:10] Thanksgiving so rooted and built up in
[1:49:15] him if something is rooted it's been
[1:49:18] through some hard work
[1:49:23] Jesus talked about the the wheat that
[1:49:25] was
[1:49:28] sewn and some of it fell on Stony
[1:49:31] ground and it just sprung up really
[1:49:35] fast and when the sun came and beat down
[1:49:38] upon
[1:49:39] it it just withered and
[1:49:44] died so we can't have Stony
[1:49:49] ground but we've got to have good
[1:49:52] ground and when we have good
[1:49:54] ground the ground of our hearts has been
[1:49:59] prepared now we can be rooted in
[1:50:03] Christ and to be
[1:50:07] rooted it means to push down
[1:50:11] deep as Paul said I want you to know the
[1:50:14] depths of the love of
[1:50:17] God so a tree when it grows
[1:50:21] they say that the roots of a
[1:50:24] tree are two or three times bigger than
[1:50:27] the
[1:50:31] top so what you see on the
[1:50:35] top is small compared to what is on the
[1:50:39] bottom so we always want to be
[1:50:43] seen and we want people to see what we
[1:50:46] do for
[1:50:48] God and we want people to see our
[1:50:51] works and we wonder why we're always
[1:50:53] falling
[1:50:55] down if you want to do something for
[1:50:59] God then you got to put your roots down
[1:51:01] in the
[1:51:03] word you got to feed on the
[1:51:06] word so that the roots go down
[1:51:10] deep you want you want to do something
[1:51:13] big for
[1:51:14] God then put the roots
[1:51:18] down the bigger you want to be for
[1:51:22] Christ the more you got to feed on the
[1:51:25] word oh it's easy to sit in the presence
[1:51:28] of the
[1:51:30] Sun and grow and grow and
[1:51:33] grow when the sun comes on the
[1:51:37] tree it just it it just grows
[1:51:42] leaves and it just produces
[1:51:45] fruit and the sun pulls everything out
[1:51:48] of
[1:51:48] it
[1:51:50] everything it possibly
[1:51:52] can and if there's not enough moisture
[1:51:55] down
[1:51:57] underneath if there's not enough
[1:52:00] Roots then it can't come to a place
[1:52:03] where it gives
[1:52:07] fruit it will wither and die before it
[1:52:09] get
[1:52:11] there but we want to be fruitful in
[1:52:14] Christ we want to find our purpose in
[1:52:18] Christ so we got to dig in
[1:52:21] deep we got to have a lot to draw
[1:52:26] from we got to have a lot on the
[1:52:29] inside feeding the holy spirit of
[1:52:33] God so that when God starts using our
[1:52:37] life then we have a lot to
[1:52:43] give for in him dwelleth all the
[1:52:46] fullness of the godhead
[1:52:48] body
[1:52:52] and you are complete in
[1:52:56] him and besides this Peter
[1:53:00] says giving all
[1:53:04] diligence besides
[1:53:07] what besides the
[1:53:10] foundation besides the holy spirit that
[1:53:12] has given you the potentials of
[1:53:16] everything besides
[1:53:18] that now you must give
[1:53:22] diligence to press into all that God has
[1:53:25] for
[1:53:26] you that's the
[1:53:29] work that's the labor you must
[1:53:32] give that's the price you must
[1:53:35] pay is your
[1:53:38] diligence to lay in the word of
[1:53:43] God because when Peter says add to your
[1:53:46] faith
[1:53:48] virtue
[1:53:51] knowled to knowledge
[1:53:53] Temperance to Temperance
[1:53:56] patience patience
[1:53:59] godliness to Godliness brotherly
[1:54:02] kindness to brotherly kindness
[1:54:06] love he's he's speaking about a
[1:54:11] relationship he's not speaking about
[1:54:14] Works he's speaking about your
[1:54:16] relationship with
[1:54:17] Christ he speaking about walking with
[1:54:21] him speaking about this is how your
[1:54:23] relationship will
[1:54:26] grow faith is your
[1:54:29] foundation and you have a good
[1:54:32] foundation so we want to go on to
[1:54:36] Perfection and we want to
[1:54:38] add we want to add virtue which is
[1:54:42] strength so as you get to know him and
[1:54:44] you feed on the
[1:54:47] word it adds strength to your
[1:54:49] relationship
[1:54:52] we're speaking about these two becoming
[1:54:55] one and they can only become one if you
[1:54:58] really get to know one
[1:55:02] another so your relationship must be
[1:55:06] strengthened and it comes by the word of
[1:55:10] God your virtue
[1:55:13] knowledge as you begin to know
[1:55:16] someone your knowledge of them grows
[1:55:21] when you know Jesus
[1:55:23] Christ when you walk with him day by
[1:55:26] day not
[1:55:29] theology not
[1:55:31] intelligence but
[1:55:34] experience this is a relationship with a
[1:55:37] person with the person of
[1:55:40] Christ so you are walking with
[1:55:43] him you're getting to know
[1:55:46] him your relationship is strengthening
[1:55:50] because as you begin to know
[1:55:52] him you begin to find out that he loves
[1:55:56] you just like that young man and young
[1:56:00] woman she he's got his eyes on
[1:56:04] her but now he begins to spend time with
[1:56:09] her and after a
[1:56:11] while she begins to
[1:56:14] recognize that he's spending a lot more
[1:56:16] time with me than he's spending with
[1:56:18] anybody else
[1:56:22] there's something different Happening
[1:56:25] Here I think that he might love
[1:56:28] me it's a deeper
[1:56:32] relationship so as you begin to know
[1:56:36] Christ you can only know him when his
[1:56:38] holy spirit dwells within
[1:56:41] you Jesus said except you be born
[1:56:45] again you cannot see the kingdom of God
[1:56:49] but you when you are birthed by the word
[1:56:51] of
[1:56:52] God and what did Brother brandham say
[1:56:54] the new birth
[1:56:56] was it was the revelation of Jesus
[1:56:59] Christ personally to
[1:57:03] you so you recognize who he
[1:57:07] is you never paid no attention
[1:57:12] before but now that you recognize that
[1:57:14] he has an interest in
[1:57:17] you now all of a sudden you're looking
[1:57:19] to
[1:57:20] him as the Bible says in Hebrews
[1:57:24] 12 laying aside every weight and the sin
[1:57:27] that be easily besets
[1:57:30] us let's look to Jesus the author and
[1:57:33] finish of
[1:57:35] our pressing towards that
[1:57:38] Mark so as we see that he has an
[1:57:40] interest in
[1:57:42] us now we need to lay aside all the
[1:57:47] distractions and we need to begin focus
[1:57:49] our eyes on
[1:57:52] him because there's something special
[1:57:56] happening and you don't want to miss
[1:57:59] it you don't want to miss what God has
[1:58:01] for
[1:58:03] you you don't want to miss your
[1:58:06] healing you don't want to miss your
[1:58:10] provision and you don't want to miss a
[1:58:11] body
[1:58:13] change so we got to keep our eyes on
[1:58:17] him because there's something special
[1:58:20] that's happening
[1:58:21] here this is a love relationship going
[1:58:25] on and you recognize that he loves
[1:58:29] you and you recognize that you love
[1:58:33] him that you came to this word because
[1:58:35] you fell in love with
[1:58:38] it you said I believe
[1:58:41] Lord you said I want to I want to be
[1:58:43] identified with
[1:58:45] you I want to be baptized in the name of
[1:58:47] Jesus Christ I want your Holy
[1:58:51] Ghost why was it that you wanted those
[1:58:54] things you look back to
[1:58:57] there and you recognize it was because
[1:58:59] you loved
[1:59:01] him and then you found out in the
[1:59:04] word you found out that you loved
[1:59:08] him because he first loved
[1:59:11] you so now you recognizing that this is
[1:59:13] a
[1:59:17] relationship and there's something
[1:59:18] inside you that says Lord I love
[1:59:22] you and now Temperance begins to come in
[1:59:25] your
[1:59:28] life Temperance is your desires being
[1:59:33] changed in the Holy Spirit transforms
[1:59:36] your
[1:59:39] desires you realize that you no longer
[1:59:42] desire the things of the
[1:59:44] world you no longer desire the things of
[1:59:47] the old man
[1:59:50] you look back and you say all of those
[1:59:52] things have been washed away from
[1:59:55] me you say ever more Lord give me this
[2:00:00] word like the disciples
[2:00:03] said to whom should we
[2:00:06] go for thou alone has the words of
[2:00:09] eternal
[2:00:10] life said Lord just keep feeding me
[2:00:14] this Lord I just can't get enough of
[2:00:17] it it's it's not because I'm trying to
[2:00:20] escape
[2:00:22] hell it's not because I'm trying to be
[2:00:24] better than the next
[2:00:26] person it's not because I want to look
[2:00:28] down on my
[2:00:29] neighbor it's only because I love you
[2:00:35] Lord because there's a relationship
[2:00:38] going
[2:00:39] on and it's a love
[2:00:43] relationship just like just like a a
[2:00:46] husband and a
[2:00:47] wife oh she just begins to look to
[2:00:52] him and she begins to to to try to
[2:00:55] understand what he
[2:00:58] likes because she wants to wear the
[2:01:00] things that he
[2:01:02] likes she wants to learn how to cook the
[2:01:05] things that he
[2:01:07] likes she wants to know everything that
[2:01:10] he
[2:01:11] likes she doesn't want to miss
[2:01:14] anything because she wants to please
[2:01:18] him she recognizes that he loves
[2:01:22] her and she loves
[2:01:25] him and she doesn't want to miss this
[2:01:30] opportunity oh my that relationship gets
[2:01:35] closer oh into Temperance comes
[2:01:39] patience as you walk with Jesus
[2:01:43] Christ you get to know
[2:01:45] him and you know his
[2:01:48] word and you know what he
[2:01:50] likes and you know how he
[2:01:52] works you know how he
[2:01:55] comes you know how he
[2:01:57] heals you know how he
[2:02:00] delivers because you've experienced it
[2:02:03] because you've been walking with
[2:02:05] him so now as you walk through
[2:02:08] life now you have
[2:02:11] patience because you know he's
[2:02:13] working because you know his word
[2:02:17] says all things work together for
[2:02:21] good what good to them who love
[2:02:25] him those who have been called according
[2:02:27] to his
[2:02:29] purpose so now you are just walking with
[2:02:34] him and you have patience with
[2:02:37] him because whatever the trial might
[2:02:40] be whatever the hardship might
[2:02:43] be you know he's working it for your
[2:02:47] good you know everything is in his
[2:02:51] hands oh you're just resting in
[2:02:55] him glory to
[2:02:58] God into patience comes
[2:03:02] godliness because you're walking with
[2:03:04] the Lord you just can't help but have
[2:03:07] all of the world washed off of
[2:03:10] you you don't want the things of the
[2:03:13] world you don't desire the things of the
[2:03:16] world not cuz you're trying to be a good
[2:03:20] you just can't help it
[2:03:22] anymore you're just in a love
[2:03:24] relationship with the
[2:03:26] word you're not trying to put it
[2:03:29] on it's the Holy Ghost doing
[2:03:32] it the Holy Ghost is working for me
[2:03:35] ins oh he washing
[2:03:38] you like as the Bible says that Christ
[2:03:42] would wash his
[2:03:44] bride that he might present her to
[2:03:47] himself as a Chase
[2:03:49] virgin not having spot or wrinkle or any
[2:03:54] such oh and from from from godliness to
[2:03:57] brotherly
[2:04:00] kindness oh the holy spirit of
[2:04:04] God working in our
[2:04:07] lives notice what kind of a bride that
[2:04:09] he's looking
[2:04:12] for not looking for one that just
[2:04:14] forgets about everybody around
[2:04:17] her but no Jesus
[2:04:20] said that by this shall all men know
[2:04:23] your my
[2:04:26] disciples nether shall all men know that
[2:04:28] you're part of my
[2:04:31] bride you have a love one for
[2:04:35] another the closer you get to
[2:04:38] Christ the more that you just want to
[2:04:41] bring everybody else in with
[2:04:44] you the more you get burdened for those
[2:04:46] lost
[2:04:47] souls the more you get burdened for your
[2:04:52] neighbor oh praise the
[2:04:55] Lord oh he doesn't forget
[2:05:00] anyone but he knows the burden of our
[2:05:04] hearts and he adds brotherly kindness to
[2:05:07] our
[2:05:10] godliness oh he bre there's such a love
[2:05:13] one for
[2:05:17] another such a burden one for
[2:05:21] another till we if we see somebody
[2:05:26] stumble if we see somebody
[2:05:29] backslide we don't say ah they never had
[2:05:32] it in the first
[2:05:34] place but we just want them to come
[2:05:40] back just come
[2:05:42] back just repent of what you
[2:05:45] done the Bible says if we repent of our
[2:05:48] sins
[2:05:50] if we confess our
[2:05:53] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[2:05:56] us of
[2:05:58] our oh no matter how far someone slides
[2:06:04] back we don't know whether they're seed
[2:06:06] or
[2:06:08] not so we just do everything we can to
[2:06:10] bring them
[2:06:12] back CU in our hearts we just hope that
[2:06:15] they're a Believer
[2:06:17] too you don't want anybody to miss
[2:06:21] it when you've experienced the love of
[2:06:25] God you just don't want anyone to miss
[2:06:28] it and brother Bram said when he went to
[2:06:30] the other
[2:06:32] side he said it was perfect
[2:06:36] love and he said thus sayth the
[2:06:39] Lord you can only get there with perfect
[2:06:45] love the Bible says the brotherly
[2:06:47] kindness he adds
[2:06:51] charity as you give diligence to heed to
[2:06:54] the word of
[2:06:57] God as you press into the word of
[2:07:01] God as you feed on it day and
[2:07:05] night holding by faith to the promises
[2:07:07] of
[2:07:10] God he's building you up building you up
[2:07:16] building you up Bible says line upon
[2:07:20] line precept upon
[2:07:22] precept here a little there a
[2:07:25] little we might feel like we got so far
[2:07:28] to
[2:07:30] go but just look back and see how far
[2:07:32] he's already brought
[2:07:40] you oh there's the quote right
[2:07:43] there in the the message adoption number
[2:07:47] four
[2:07:50] thus sayith the
[2:07:51] Lord it'll take perfect love to put you
[2:07:54] in that
[2:07:57] place for that's all that was
[2:08:02] there no matter what
[2:08:05] money how much religious
[2:08:10] demonstrations how many Good Deeds you
[2:08:12] done whatever you've
[2:08:15] done that won't count nothing on that
[2:08:17] day
[2:08:20] it'll take perfect
[2:08:22] love so whatever you
[2:08:27] do you lay aside everything
[2:08:32] else until you're just so filled with
[2:08:35] the love of
[2:08:39] God till you can love those who hate
[2:08:45] you glory to God
[2:08:49] in the message thy
[2:08:51] house brother Bram says when you go to
[2:08:55] church you say well I'm going to join
[2:08:59] church I'm going to be
[2:09:02] baptized if that doesn't come from a
[2:09:04] heart of love to
[2:09:10] God it'll never go
[2:09:13] nowhere all you'll do is just join
[2:09:16] church and be baptized
[2:09:20] but when you are converted to
[2:09:23] Christ a love to
[2:09:26] Christ then you accumulate a faith in
[2:09:31] Christ just like you would to your wife
[2:09:33] or your
[2:09:36] hus you accumulate a faith that you walk
[2:09:39] in that
[2:09:41] Faith just something about
[2:09:45] you you just got something that anchors
[2:09:48] you
[2:09:52] in the message Christ is the mystery of
[2:09:53] God
[2:09:57] revealed this is God's great mystery of
[2:10:00] Love
[2:10:03] expressed that God and man became
[2:10:07] one the whole thing is God and man
[2:10:13] [Music]
[2:10:15] one and the Bible says in 1 John 4
[2:10:20] and there is no fear in
[2:10:24] love but perfect love cast out
[2:10:30] fear because fear has
[2:10:34] torment and we're talking about a
[2:10:36] marriage
[2:10:39] relationship and what kind of a marriage
[2:10:41] would it be if there was torment
[2:10:44] there what kind of a a marriage would it
[2:10:46] be if the wife was always terrified of
[2:10:49] doing something
[2:10:52] wrong but that's not how God expressed
[2:10:55] his
[2:10:58] love perfect love cast out all
[2:11:03] fear as you walk with
[2:11:06] Christ you walk with him in
[2:11:09] love he casts out all
[2:11:12] fear he cast out all
[2:11:15] doubts until you know that you can never
[2:11:17] be lost
[2:11:20] until you know it's just him and
[2:11:23] you do you know that youve met him in
[2:11:26] that secret
[2:11:29] place something is
[2:11:31] different that you never be the
[2:11:34] same you look at the Bible in a new
[2:11:38] way a way that you never looked at it
[2:11:42] before anytime you open the pages of
[2:11:44] God's
[2:11:46] word all you see is God's love to
[2:11:50] you Romans
[2:11:53] 8:35 it says who shall separate us from
[2:11:56] the love of
[2:11:58] God shall
[2:12:01] tribulation or
[2:12:04] distress or
[2:12:06] persecution or
[2:12:08] famine or
[2:12:10] nakedness
[2:12:17] or or
[2:12:19] sword as it is
[2:12:21] written for thy sake we are killed all
[2:12:24] the day
[2:12:26] long we are counted as sheep for the
[2:12:31] slaughter oh what kind of love is
[2:12:34] that but when you are in love with
[2:12:37] God when you come to a place where he's
[2:12:39] open his capsule message to
[2:12:43] you so you not just see that the message
[2:12:46] is true
[2:12:49] but now the message is in
[2:12:52] you now you have become the
[2:12:56] message and when you become the
[2:12:59] message you know it's not about these
[2:13:01] Natural Things
[2:13:04] anymore but you are just so in love with
[2:13:07] God you know you're part of his
[2:13:11] kingdom you know when John saw that New
[2:13:13] Jerusalem coming
[2:13:16] down that you were
[2:13:19] there that when brother Bram saw them on
[2:13:22] the other
[2:13:24] side that you were
[2:13:26] there because you are in Jesus
[2:13:30] Christ not only have you recognized that
[2:13:32] he is in
[2:13:34] you but you'll recognize that you are in
[2:13:38] him and death doesn't matter
[2:13:42] anymore we are counted as sheep for the
[2:13:46] slaughter all these things we are more
[2:13:49] than
[2:13:53] conquerors not by
[2:13:58] ourselves but through him that loved
[2:14:03] us for I am persuaded Paul
[2:14:08] says that neither
[2:14:10] death nor
[2:14:12] life nor
[2:14:14] angels nor
[2:14:16] principalities nor
[2:14:19] powers nor things
[2:14:22] present it doesn't matter what the
[2:14:24] circumstance is right
[2:14:26] now no things to
[2:14:28] come we might think that there's trouble
[2:14:31] coming down the
[2:14:33] road when you are in love with
[2:14:36] God it doesn't matter
[2:14:39] anymore it's just you and
[2:14:42] [Applause]
[2:14:43] Christ nor
[2:14:45] height nor depth
[2:14:48] nor any other
[2:14:51] creature shall be able to separate
[2:14:55] us from the love of
[2:14:58] God and where do we find that
[2:15:02] love is in Jesus Christ Our
[2:15:06] Lord
