[13:52] and every one of us be blessed, Father.
[13:55] And we live and say, "Oh, God answered
[13:58] our prayer. God did this. God did the
[14:00] other." Lord, when you remember in the
[14:02] Bible, they on their way on to Emma's
[14:05] father, and you appeared and you talked
[14:07] to them. May you talk to each and every
[14:09] one of us. May you answer each and every
[14:12] prayer that has not been answered. Lord,
[14:14] you want to live here victorious. We
[14:16] pray. We believe we dedicate the service

[1:19:51] Jesus.

[1:24:15] Oh

[1:24:35] We

[1:24:40] [Music]
[1:24:43] we might
[1:24:51] see
[1:24:54] one
[1:24:57] preserve for
[1:24:59] [Music]
[1:25:08] Every God
[1:25:12] for
[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:19] every
[1:25:22] [Music]
[1:25:26] patient changing.
[1:25:31] I'm changing you.
[1:25:35] We
[1:25:37] are
[1:25:41] we all
[1:25:45] [Music]
[1:25:50] I've
[1:25:52] come
[1:25:54] [Music]
[1:25:59] with
[1:26:05] Christ. Amen.
[1:26:08] Shall we bow our heads in our prayer?
[1:26:13] As the song I said,
[1:26:16] these words are ancient.
[1:26:18] [Music]
[1:26:20] But they are ever true
[1:26:23] and their purpose is to change
[1:26:27] you as to change me.
[1:26:31] Then he say we have
[1:26:33] come with open
[1:26:36] heart and let the ancient
[1:26:39] word
[1:26:41] impart because sound from God's own
[1:26:45] [Music]
[1:26:47] heart. Nothing can change a
[1:26:51] man save the word of God.
[1:26:55] That's why we have come this
[1:26:57] morning in the quietness of the Holy
[1:27:01] Spirit to have a talk with
[1:27:04] God. Talk to him. He talks back
[1:27:08] to our prophet told
[1:27:10] [Music]
[1:27:12] us. Our prophet told
[1:27:15] us and he
[1:27:17] say we come to this place.
[1:27:22] It has been ordained.
[1:27:25] to worship
[1:27:27] God, not to see each
[1:27:30] other. We can do it that
[1:27:33] outside or go to our
[1:27:36] home. We have to come
[1:27:38] here. Be
[1:27:40] quiet. Talk to God and he talks to
[1:27:44] us. Open our hearts to
[1:27:46] him. The Lord work on me.
[1:27:50] Touch
[1:27:51] me down. I'm heavy, Lord. Take off this
[1:27:57] Lord
[1:27:58] of this
[1:28:01] place where we
[1:28:03] come to be
[1:28:06] comforted as
[1:28:08] believers, as children of
[1:28:11] God. Father, we are thankful.
[1:28:14] David said, "I will enter his
[1:28:18] gates with thanksgiving in my
[1:28:21] heart." Lord, we are not
[1:28:24] worthy, but we
[1:28:26] believe that our sins have
[1:28:30] been all washed
[1:28:33] away, cast in the sea of God's
[1:28:37] forgiveness. Wash me in the blood of the
[1:28:40] lamb, the Lord God Almighty.
[1:28:44] You can minister to
[1:28:46] us. Take the flesh
[1:28:49] aside. Anoint and inspire
[1:28:52] us. Father, we are
[1:28:55] insufficient. We don't know how to
[1:28:57] breathe this
[1:28:59] word. Ourselves. We are men and women
[1:29:03] [Music]
[1:29:09] of wrongs here and
[1:29:11] there. But like David
[1:29:16] say
[1:29:18] heart
[1:29:21] right. May our inner
[1:29:24] mind may the inner
[1:29:26] mind be
[1:29:28] renewed and
[1:29:31] refreshed this morning in the name of
[1:29:34] the Lord
[1:29:36] Jesus our Lord and
[1:29:38] Savior. The Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:29:42] We have done
[1:29:44] it. We bless your
[1:29:46] name. We commit a service into your
[1:29:48] hand.
[1:29:50] Amen.
[1:29:53] [Music]
[1:29:56] Amen. Amen. God richly bless you.
[1:30:02] We thank God that we are
[1:30:06] again the Lord fell fell.
[1:30:10] [Music]
[1:30:13] It fell that way
[1:30:16] and
[1:30:19] uh you can't be used to standing
[1:30:24] here. You'll never get
[1:30:27] used if you really want to be
[1:30:33] sincere. Amen. Let us read from the book
[1:30:37] of Philippians chapter 4.
[1:30:41] Verse 413.
[1:30:46] Just open your hearts.
[1:30:49] We are just going to have a little
[1:30:51] talk. It is 11:30.
[1:30:56] Right. Yes. Um Philippians 4 chapter
[1:31:01] Philippians 4:43.
[1:31:05] We have a visitor
[1:31:07] here who hasn't
[1:31:11] mentioned fromala.
[1:31:14] [Music]
[1:31:16] Please wave to
[1:31:17] us. God rich bless you
[1:31:20] sir. You're most
[1:31:22] welcome feel at
[1:31:24] home. May you be blessed by the
[1:31:26] words and we look forward to seeing
[1:31:29] again and again and again and again and
[1:31:32] again. Amen.
[1:31:34] The Bible says,
[1:31:38] "Rejoice in the Lord always." And again,
[1:31:41] I say,
[1:31:45] "Rejoice." Let us move
[1:31:48] together.
[1:31:54] Yeah. Rejoice in the Lord only. And
[1:31:57] again, I say rejoice.
[1:31:59] [Music]
[1:32:03] Let your moderation be known unto all
[1:32:05] men. The Lord is at
[1:32:12] hand. Be careful for nothing, but in
[1:32:15] everything by prayer and supplication
[1:32:17] with thanksgiving, let your requests be
[1:32:19] made known unto God.
[1:32:32] And the peace of God which passes all
[1:32:35] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:32:37] minds through Christ Jesus.
[1:32:50] Finally, brethren, whatever things are
[1:32:53] true, whatsoever things are honest,
[1:32:56] whatever things are just, whatever
[1:32:58] things are pure, whatever things are
[1:33:00] lovely, whatever things are of good
[1:33:03] report, if there be any virtue, and if
[1:33:07] there be any praise, think on these
[1:33:11] things.
[1:33:33] Those things which you have both learned
[1:33:36] and
[1:33:37] received. Listen carefully. Those things
[1:33:40] which ye have both learned and received
[1:33:43] and heard and seen in me, do and the God
[1:33:47] of peace shall be with you.
[1:33:59] But I rejoice in the Lord greatly that
[1:34:02] now at last your care of me has
[1:34:05] flourished again wherein were also
[1:34:08] careful but lacked the opportunity.
[1:34:27] [Music]
[1:34:28] Not that I speak in respect of
[1:34:32] want. Not that I speak in respect of
[1:34:35] want. For I have learned in whatever
[1:34:39] state I am, therewith to be
[1:34:49] [Music]
[1:34:53] content, I know both how to be a best
[1:34:56] and I know how to abound. Everywhere and
[1:35:00] in all things I am instructed both to be
[1:35:04] full and to be hungry, both to abound
[1:35:06] and to suffer.
[1:35:09] [Music]
[1:35:17] [Music]
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:30] I can do all things through Christ which
[1:35:34] strengthens
[1:35:39] me. Amen.
[1:35:42] Father, add a blessing to the reading of
[1:35:44] your word.
[1:35:47] Send thy spirit of
[1:35:49] wisdom. Divide it to your
[1:35:52] people. Let it give them the life of
[1:35:56] Christ. Have your way. We know you are
[1:35:59] here. May we be cautious of
[1:36:02] that. We pray
[1:36:04] father
[1:36:07] humbly
[1:36:10] weak in the name of our lord Jesus
[1:36:13] Christ. Amen. Amen. Carefully take your
[1:36:16] seats.
[1:36:19] Amen.
[1:36:21] Before I go for further
[1:36:24] uh I want to read this again in the New
[1:36:27] Living Translation
[1:36:30] also. Brother, you may not interpret.
[1:36:33] Amen. Always be full of joy in the Lord.
[1:36:36] I say it again. Rejoice. Let everyone
[1:36:39] see that you are considerate in all you
[1:36:41] do. Remember the Lord is coming soon.
[1:36:44] Don't worry about anything. Instead,
[1:36:47] pray about everything. Tell God what you
[1:36:49] need and thank him for all he has done.
[1:36:53] Then you will experience God's peace
[1:36:56] which exceeds anything you can
[1:36:58] understand. His peace will guard your
[1:37:00] hearts and minds as you live in Christ
[1:37:03] Jesus. And now, dear brothers and
[1:37:05] sisters, one final thing. Fix your
[1:37:09] thoughts on what is true and honorable
[1:37:12] and right and pure and lovely and
[1:37:15] admirable. Think about the things that
[1:37:18] are excellent and worthy of
[1:37:21] praise. Keep putting into practice all
[1:37:24] you learned and received from me.
[1:37:28] Everything you heard from me and saw me
[1:37:30] doing. Then the God of peace will be
[1:37:33] with
[1:37:36] you. How I praise the Lord that you are
[1:37:39] concerned about me again. I know you
[1:37:42] have always been concerned for me, but
[1:37:44] you didn't have the chance to help me.
[1:37:46] Not that I was ever in need, for I have
[1:37:50] learned how to be content with whatever
[1:37:53] I have. I know how to live on almost
[1:37:56] nothing or with everything. I have
[1:38:00] learned the secret of living in every
[1:38:04] situation, whether it is with a full
[1:38:06] stomach or empty, with plenty or little,
[1:38:10] for I can do everything through Christ
[1:38:13] who gives me strength. Amen. I want to
[1:38:16] talk about
[1:38:21] contentment just to talk about
[1:38:26] contentment.
[1:38:27] Amen.
[1:38:30] Contentment is a freedom from
[1:38:34] worry and
[1:38:37] frustrations about unfulfilled desires
[1:38:40] in
[1:38:45] life. You are stable. You are not
[1:38:49] shaken. You are not
[1:38:51] moved. No
[1:38:54] heartaches. Not pressured up.
[1:38:58] But in this neurotic age that
[1:39:01] we in any times that we are living
[1:39:04] in the end time
[1:39:06] conditions the Bible says perplexity of
[1:39:12] times men's heart failing for fear.
[1:39:17] We said be filled with the
[1:39:19] spirit. Your alarm streamed and
[1:39:22] clear the end time
[1:39:25] conditions and conditions of
[1:39:27] trouble, the conditions of
[1:39:30] perplexity, hardiness in
[1:39:33] life, a lot of
[1:39:35] struggles. It is hard to
[1:39:38] live. It is hard for a man to catch
[1:39:41] something and live by it and freely
[1:39:45] possess
[1:39:47] something. So the condition that we're
[1:39:49] living in today, it says the love of
[1:39:52] many shall grow
[1:39:55] cold, there shall be no
[1:39:58] contentment, no freedom, no liberty.
[1:40:02] and coming to
[1:40:04] Christ, coming to the church,
[1:40:07] confessing, thank God I am
[1:40:09] free from this world of
[1:40:12] sin but seriously not
[1:40:15] free because you lack
[1:40:19] something. We are talking about
[1:40:22] contentment in this age that you are
[1:40:26] living in. It's a lukewarm
[1:40:29] generation. Part in the world in
[1:40:33] Christ believe not a
[1:40:35] believer but we don't want to be
[1:40:38] that we want to be real solid
[1:40:42] Christian Lord prepare me to be a
[1:40:46] sanctuary pure and holy tried and
[1:40:50] true. We do not want to
[1:40:54] be a step in the
[1:40:56] Lord a step
[1:40:59] outside. We want to be
[1:41:01] Christians, genuine
[1:41:03] Christians. That's what we are longing
[1:41:06] for.
[1:41:08] Contentment. You find people are not
[1:41:12] contented in this age about their
[1:41:18] gender. Men want to be
[1:41:21] women. They would have a plastic
[1:41:24] surgery and become a woman. But you will
[1:41:28] still remain a
[1:41:30] man by the
[1:41:34] hormones. Try to change that because
[1:41:37] they are not contacted with their
[1:41:41] gender. Women want to be
[1:41:43] men because they lack
[1:41:46] contentment for who they are, what God
[1:41:50] made them to
[1:41:51] be. But you have got a
[1:41:55] commission. And the only way to fulfill
[1:41:57] that
[1:41:59] commission love what you
[1:42:02] are in this age. We have got the
[1:42:06] people and not
[1:42:08] contented about their
[1:42:12] nationality. They do not feel
[1:42:14] proud to be called a
[1:42:17] Uganda pleased God.
[1:42:22] So they would rather run
[1:42:24] away got some other country. They
[1:42:27] changed their national
[1:42:29] authority. Not because they are sent by
[1:42:32] God, but because they were not
[1:42:35] contained to be what God made to be
[1:42:40] Ugandans or whatever
[1:42:43] nationality that God gave
[1:42:46] them. The people not
[1:42:48] content about their race.
[1:42:53] Well, we
[1:42:54] say the the black
[1:42:57] people want to be
[1:43:00] white. They are not
[1:43:02] content. Something was planted in their
[1:43:06] heart. Make them
[1:43:08] believe that being black is
[1:43:17] undeserving. And
[1:43:18] now that same thing
[1:43:22] If it is a spirit, it deceives the white
[1:43:25] man
[1:43:30] too. It is a spirit. So the people not
[1:43:34] contented about their
[1:43:37] [Music]
[1:43:41] race. They would rather
[1:43:44] preach and become brown.
[1:43:51] But they become
[1:43:56] ugly. They look terrible.
[1:44:11] The knees are
[1:44:15] black. The lips are
[1:44:18] black. You are destroying your
[1:44:21] soul. There is no
[1:44:23] contentment about their body
[1:44:27] size. I've seen twice of
[1:44:29] these. One was
[1:44:32] thin. She was a
[1:44:34] sister. Ever not contented.
[1:44:38] I'm too thin. I should eat pork of
[1:44:40] fats. The fats of
[1:44:44] pork
[1:44:46] [Music]
[1:44:51] at I'm not happy
[1:44:53] happy. I'm not
[1:44:55] pleased. I've had
[1:44:58] brothers. I've heard
[1:45:00] brothers not like
[1:45:04] sisters. There is a brother for you.
[1:45:08] that likes many
[1:45:11] sisters. There is that
[1:45:13] brother. There is a sister
[1:45:16] also naturally
[1:45:20] fat young girl naturally fat in high
[1:45:23] school.
[1:45:26] is a big
[1:45:27] brother. Big
[1:45:29] brother, I'm so
[1:45:31] faded. I want to cut
[1:45:33] you every day
[1:45:38] troubled me at school. But you are
[1:45:41] beautiful
[1:45:44] and
[1:45:45] you say brothers don't like
[1:45:50] that brothers like that.
[1:45:59] But the people are not
[1:46:01] content. They will go for plastic
[1:46:05] surgery, put on fake
[1:46:08] bombs
[1:46:11] whatsoever to look what they are
[1:46:14] not because they
[1:46:17] content. You find the people are not
[1:46:20] content about their stature.
[1:46:24] Because they are
[1:46:25] short. They feel no
[1:46:28] sister. The shorty brother. There is a
[1:46:31] sister here. He loves a shorty
[1:46:35] brother.
[1:46:38] Brother said this is too
[1:46:42] tall. I don't want a
[1:46:45] tower. Brother,
[1:46:48] there is a sister here. What I'm trying
[1:46:52] to get you
[1:46:53] conviction, what you are truly is the
[1:46:57] perfect what you ought to
[1:47:01] be. They are not
[1:47:04] contented about their
[1:47:07] tribe. You a Christian now. But God
[1:47:10] chose you a certain
[1:47:13] tribe. Every tribe those people have got
[1:47:18] a certain way they look.
[1:47:21] different from
[1:47:22] others. Their
[1:47:24] accent, some of them is too
[1:47:28] bad. Are
[1:47:32] you that word is not
[1:47:35] like you're speaking it badly, but it is
[1:47:38] the
[1:47:41] accent. Don't make him
[1:47:45] uncomfort. Don't start to feel
[1:47:47] discontented.
[1:47:50] Just be proud of
[1:47:52] that. We find children. They're not
[1:47:56] contented about their
[1:48:00] parents, they reach an
[1:48:02] extent. When the parents, pick them and
[1:48:06] take them to schools of rich people a
[1:48:10] bit, the parent
[1:48:13] struggles, give them the best. When they
[1:48:17] reach there now the video
[1:48:20] comes with other
[1:48:22] parents we come
[1:48:26] driving and and now they see
[1:48:31] her. Mommy's going to come
[1:48:34] walking. I'm
[1:48:36] finished. I'm going to be
[1:48:39] ashamed. She's coming with a
[1:48:42] basket with a food flask.
[1:48:46] with flight that
[1:48:48] easy. She's not even going to give me
[1:48:50] pocket money and they feel
[1:48:54] ashamed. They tend to shine
[1:48:57] away. They come but they don't feel
[1:49:01] comforted. You are not
[1:49:04] that you accept what you
[1:49:07] are. There was a little
[1:49:10] girl talked about this.
[1:49:13] The mother took her to school.
[1:49:18] But when she reached that
[1:49:21] school, she got
[1:49:24] influenced by the
[1:49:26] friend. You know the friend talking
[1:49:29] about what they talk, what they
[1:49:31] share. The time
[1:49:33] came they had to go back home. While
[1:49:37] they were in the
[1:49:38] bus going home towards the
[1:49:43] station, this other friend of
[1:49:45] hers looked and saw an ugly looking
[1:49:50] woman. She said,
[1:49:53] "Oh, isn't she awful?
[1:49:59] Ugly. She looks terrible.
[1:50:03] My my
[1:50:05] my but that was the
[1:50:08] mother of the
[1:50:12] friend reaching the
[1:50:15] station. This young
[1:50:17] lady because of the words of the
[1:50:21] friend. She felt so
[1:50:25] discouraged, so
[1:50:27] discontented,
[1:50:29] uncomfortable. And when she came
[1:50:31] out, she was passing the mother. The
[1:50:35] mother came out. He said, "Leave me
[1:50:38] alone. I don't
[1:50:42] know." There was a tax conductor
[1:50:45] there. He said, "I know this
[1:50:48] girl and I know the mother and I know
[1:50:52] the story.
[1:50:54] Someday the mother was washing
[1:50:57] clothes and she went out from the top of
[1:51:00] the floor
[1:51:01] there. No. She came down
[1:51:05] to hang the crosses. To hang the
[1:51:08] crosses. While she was
[1:51:10] down, fire got up the other
[1:51:13] side where the baby was. The mother took
[1:51:17] a
[1:51:18] veil herself and entered through the
[1:51:22] fire and picked the baby. But now to
[1:51:26] come out, one of them had to lose
[1:51:31] the
[1:51:35] other and she got the
[1:51:38] ve it around the baby and went through
[1:51:41] the fire and it build off a beautiful
[1:51:44] face.
[1:51:47] He said, "You girl, you don't
[1:51:50] know. It's not so beautiful for you to
[1:51:52] look
[1:51:53] beautiful." And the prophet
[1:51:56] says, "That's how we
[1:51:58] look." And the Lord
[1:52:00] Jesus, we get ashamed of
[1:52:03] him, despised,
[1:52:07] afflicted. But he was
[1:52:09] despised for your sake.
[1:52:12] He was
[1:52:13] ashamed for your
[1:52:16] sake. Don't be discouraged about that.
[1:52:22] So the people they get to that
[1:52:26] point is
[1:52:28] contented troubled about useless
[1:52:34] things very
[1:52:38] useless.
[1:52:41] Discontentment draws many people into
[1:52:44] covetousness.
[1:52:48] In Exodus
[1:52:51] 27, the Bible says, "Covert not thy
[1:52:55] neighbor's
[1:52:57] house, Covert not thy neighbor's
[1:53:02] house or your neighbor's
[1:53:05] ass, all the man's
[1:53:09] servants, all his possessions.
[1:53:14] not but
[1:53:17] discontentment brings
[1:53:19] about and some people they think that
[1:53:23] having
[1:53:25] plenty takes
[1:53:29] away they think that having
[1:53:32] plenty brings
[1:53:34] contentment but it cannot do
[1:53:38] it. The king
[1:53:40] deputy had many
[1:53:42] wives all over the
[1:53:45] palace. He could get any
[1:53:48] virgin that he desired and he wasn't
[1:53:55] guilty.
[1:53:56] But he
[1:54:00] took one that
[1:54:04] had only
[1:54:06] one king had many.
[1:54:09] I expect him to be
[1:54:11] contented. I expect him to be
[1:54:17] contented. But he was not
[1:54:21] contented. He converted his neighbor's
[1:54:23] wife.
[1:54:28] And God sent him a
[1:54:30] prophet and he gave him a
[1:54:33] proverb and he realized that he had
[1:54:37] sinned. Lack of
[1:54:39] contentment leads many to
[1:54:45] sin. See look how this
[1:54:48] king looks over at that
[1:54:53] woman. Who is this woman?
[1:55:01] He didn't
[1:55:04] care to
[1:55:06] me and he took
[1:55:09] her
[1:55:11] discontented,
[1:55:14] dissatisfaction leading into
[1:55:17] sin. The
[1:55:19] king was a king in Israel.
[1:55:23] He had a
[1:55:24] lot riches and
[1:55:26] honor, wealth. He could get the money
[1:55:30] that
[1:55:31] he land that he
[1:55:33] wanted. But he saw his
[1:55:38] vineard and he desired him and refused
[1:55:42] to give it to him because it was his
[1:55:46] inheritance. The king was so troubled.
[1:55:49] He got so
[1:55:51] displeased. He
[1:55:55] converted. He murdered the
[1:55:57] man and he took his
[1:56:00] fight. He was
[1:56:04] discontented.
[1:56:06] Contentment. The devil was the first
[1:56:09] creature without
[1:56:12] contentment. Perfect in beauty.
[1:56:16] Shall be that
[1:56:19] covers above all
[1:56:22] angels full of
[1:56:24] wisdom. If the
[1:56:26] tumbles are saying well but he was not
[1:56:33] content that led him to
[1:56:37] disobey. He was not
[1:56:39] contented with what God had
[1:56:42] made. He instead wanted to be like God.
[1:56:53] discontentment. Brother,
[1:56:55] sister, a lot of
[1:56:57] people live a worldly
[1:57:01] life, worldly
[1:57:03] life, full of
[1:57:06] frustrations. They have
[1:57:09] ambitions. They have set
[1:57:12] goals that gets them into
[1:57:14] disappointment.
[1:57:18] because they have not been
[1:57:22] fruitful. You have got to have
[1:57:26] desires like any other human
[1:57:28] being. And any wise thinking
[1:57:32] man has got to have
[1:57:35] ambitions. You set your
[1:57:37] ambitions when you are young. But yet in
[1:57:42] the midst of all these
[1:57:44] things, we must never forget in Proverbs
[1:57:49] 16:9, the Bible says, "A man's
[1:57:52] heart devises his
[1:57:55] way, but the Lord directs his
[1:58:00] step.
[1:58:02] Contentment is
[1:58:05] positivity. It is positivity.
[1:58:10] appreciating what you
[1:58:13] have rather than focusing on what you
[1:58:16] don't
[1:58:20] have. Contentment is
[1:58:24] positivity. Appreciating what you
[1:58:28] have rather than focusing on what you
[1:58:31] don't
[1:58:35] have and to worry about it.
[1:58:39] Don't you ever be too
[1:58:42] blinded by
[1:58:44] worry to the extent that you can't
[1:58:49] see what God has
[1:58:54] done and what he is doing for
[1:58:58] you. There is what he has
[1:59:00] done. But there is what he's
[1:59:03] doing. Brother Bram says whenever
[1:59:07] something is happening down
[1:59:09] here, there is something happening up in
[1:59:13] heaven. Count your
[1:59:15] blessings. Name them one by one. Count
[1:59:19] your
[1:59:20] blessings. See what God has
[1:59:23] done. Hallelujah. God wants you to
[1:59:27] see and give him
[1:59:29] glory and give him
[1:59:32] praise.
[1:59:34] Contentment doesn't take away
[1:59:42] ambition. It doesn't take away
[1:59:49] desperation. It is simply an inner
[1:59:56] sufficiency that keeps us at
[1:59:59] [Music]
[2:00:02] peace in spite of outward
[2:00:08] [Music]
[2:00:11] circumstances.
[2:00:13] Contentment isn't
[2:00:18] complency.
[2:00:20] Contentment can exist
[2:00:24] together with
[2:00:30] ambition.
[2:00:32] Exactly. Contentment can exist with
[2:00:35] growth.
[2:00:39] with
[2:00:42] growth. As long as you are
[2:00:46] satisfied with your current
[2:00:48] [Music]
[2:00:50] state while
[2:00:53] striving for
[2:00:58] more
[2:00:59] contentment is not complacency.
[2:01:06] Complency implies a lack of
[2:01:09] [Music]
[2:01:12] effort.
[2:01:13] [Music]
[2:01:15] Exactly. A lack of
[2:01:18] effort on desire to
[2:01:21] improve. You are not
[2:01:24] contented. You are complacent.
[2:01:29] Compulsive
[2:01:31] people not
[2:01:33] awareness. They are resistant to
[2:01:37] [Music]
[2:01:41] change. They lack
[2:01:44] motivation. They lack
[2:01:46] inspiration. They lack
[2:01:48] wisdom. Come to the Lord. He gives you
[2:01:52] wisdom.
[2:01:54] Contentment is not complacency.
[2:02:06] complacent
[2:02:07] people become
[2:02:11] stagnant miss opportunities.
[2:02:19] Never deceive
[2:02:21] yourself and you you are in
[2:02:44] complenced but in
[2:02:46] sin in sin.
[2:02:49] You are just
[2:02:52] complacent in
[2:02:54] poverty or you are there in
[2:02:57] need or in
[2:03:00] sickness.
[2:03:05] Contentment as can't doesn't take away
[2:03:09] desire for
[2:03:15] growth of
[2:03:19] change. Complacent
[2:03:23] people are not
[2:03:25] contented. They are actually
[2:03:29] defeated and
[2:03:35] selfentered.
[2:03:37] Contentment isn't a natural
[2:03:43] virtue. The people have a
[2:03:47] saying that I was created because they
[2:03:51] can be
[2:03:53] patient, a little quiet and silent.
[2:03:58] They humble like
[2:03:59] that but
[2:04:03] like it is my
[2:04:06] nature nature given
[2:04:11] virtues cannot stand the test of time.
[2:04:18] Wait. When the test
[2:04:20] comes, God will bring a
[2:04:23] test to prove to you that your nature
[2:04:26] given
[2:04:29] virtues can not stand the test of
[2:04:34] time. It is a self
[2:04:38] righteousness. And God doesn't like
[2:04:41] us. Self
[2:04:43] integrity. I know myself. I know myself.
[2:04:45] I know myself.
[2:04:47] God will prove to
[2:04:49] you
[2:04:51] weak
[2:04:53] contentment isn't natural
[2:05:00] [Music]
[2:05:02] virtue like
[2:05:04] that. You are lying to us. You have to
[2:05:08] learn
[2:05:11] it. Contentment is learned.
[2:05:16] And learning is by
[2:05:20] experience. Philippians chapter 4 verse
[2:05:23] 11 he
[2:05:24] says not that I speak in respect of
[2:05:29] want for I have
[2:05:33] learned in whatever state I
[2:05:36] am with to be
[2:05:40] content. I have learned
[2:05:43] it. It is
[2:05:46] experiences. It says I know how to
[2:05:48] appear
[2:05:50] best. I know how to
[2:05:52] abound everywhere and in all
[2:05:55] things. I am
[2:05:58] instructed. I am
[2:06:00] instructed. I am
[2:06:02] instructed. Who is this instructing him?
[2:06:06] It is the Lord both to be full and to be
[2:06:10] hungry, both to abound and suffer.
[2:06:20] [Music]
[2:06:27] So you see here it is a
[2:06:31] thought it is only
[2:06:34] thought it is
[2:06:36] experience and look what he says he
[2:06:40] doesn't say and I'm like
[2:06:43] that he says I can do
[2:06:45] it only through
[2:06:54] If your
[2:06:57] contentment is controlled by earthly
[2:07:00] outward material
[2:07:06] things, you will never be
[2:07:09] contented all the days of your
[2:07:13] life. You will always be miserable.
[2:07:20] Sorrowful contentment comes from
[2:07:25] within and it is a virtue of the Holy
[2:07:29] Ghost. 1 Timothy chapter
[2:07:33] 6 verse three
[2:07:40] says if any man teach other otherwise
[2:07:44] and consent not to follow some words
[2:07:47] even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:07:49] unto the doctrine which is according to
[2:07:52] godliness he is proud
[2:08:07] Okay. Knowing
[2:08:10] nothing but doubting about questions and
[2:08:13] stripes of words. Where of cometh
[2:08:15] envings?
[2:08:22] [Music]
[2:08:38] disputings of men of corrupt minds and
[2:08:41] destitute of the truth. Supposing that
[2:08:44] gain is godliness, from such withdraw
[2:08:48] thyself.
[2:08:58] [Music]
[2:09:04] But godliness with contentment is a
[2:09:08] great gain.
[2:09:15] We brought nothing into this
[2:09:18] world and it is certain we can we can
[2:09:22] carry nothing
[2:09:25] out and having food and
[2:09:30] raignment. Let us be there with
[2:09:34] content. But they that will be
[2:09:38] rich fall into
[2:09:40] temptation and a snare and into many
[2:09:44] foolish and hurtful
[2:09:47] lusts which drown men in destruction and
[2:09:53] pition. Now listen, money is not
[2:09:57] bad. Riches is not bad. what he says for
[2:10:01] the love of
[2:10:04] money. Money is not
[2:10:07] bad. It is only bad in the hands of a
[2:10:09] bad
[2:10:11] man. For the love of
[2:10:14] money, is the root of all
[2:10:18] evil which some converted
[2:10:21] after. They have errored from the
[2:10:25] faith and pierced
[2:10:28] themselves through with many
[2:10:31] [Music]
[2:10:36] sorrows. But thou, oh man of
[2:10:40] God, the things
[2:10:42] If you follow after
[2:10:45] righteous,
[2:10:47] godliness, faith, love, patience,
[2:10:52] sickness, fight the good fight
[2:10:55] of hold on eternal
[2:10:58] life until thou also called.
[2:11:04] Brother,
[2:11:05] contentment does not come from outward
[2:11:10] things or how much you
[2:11:13] have. Believest thou this
[2:11:17] 1951, the prophet says when he called
[2:11:20] his
[2:11:21] disciples, he never went and got the
[2:11:24] educated priest out of the
[2:11:29] seminary. He went down on the river.
[2:11:34] and go
[2:11:35] fishermen and go
[2:11:38] business, poor
[2:11:40] people that they would have
[2:11:43] nothing. They would have nothing that
[2:11:46] the world would
[2:11:49] say. Why? Yes, they became great men
[2:11:52] because they had a great
[2:11:53] [Music]
[2:11:56] background. They had no background at
[2:12:00] all. And he just picked them out like a
[2:12:05] jewels out of the
[2:12:08] dirt and he made their names
[2:12:12] [Music]
[2:12:15] immortal. God picks the
[2:12:18] people and he makes them
[2:12:21] immortal. He picks little
[2:12:24] Joel and turns them to
[2:12:27] beauty. Peter, James, John and so
[2:12:31] forth. Fishermen of lowly pant type
[2:12:38] people. I'm so glad that God still deals
[2:12:43] with poor
[2:12:45] people and common
[2:12:47] people. The scripture
[2:12:50] says to the
[2:12:52] poor that is in the heart.
[2:12:57] The gospel is
[2:12:59] preached. But again he's saying the
[2:13:02] common
[2:13:03] people had him
[2:13:06] gladly. The gospel is simple.
[2:13:13] God in
[2:13:16] simplicity, hiding himself in
[2:13:19] simplicity, revealing himself in the
[2:13:22] same. Brother,
[2:13:25] every time we get to think that God is
[2:13:30] is something great like
[2:13:40] mysterious search and search and search
[2:13:42] and pass
[2:13:46] him. It is in
[2:13:49] simplicity that we know God.
[2:13:54] For we don't have much of this world is
[2:13:58] good. We don't desire this world is
[2:14:03] good. Put your soul on things
[2:14:06] [Music]
[2:14:08] eternal. Hold God's unchanging
[2:14:12] [Applause]
[2:14:13] hand. If there is
[2:14:16] anything that we ought not to
[2:14:19] desire, is it too much of this thing?
[2:14:24] I aim
[2:14:26] higher each day. I work hard to go
[2:14:31] higher and I love to become
[2:14:34] great and rich. But I am
[2:14:42] content just enough to live
[2:14:46] by. That's
[2:14:48] all the prophet says.
[2:14:53] what you
[2:14:55] have. It may look too
[2:14:58] much, but it matches
[2:15:03] exactly. Look, look, look. What you have
[2:15:07] may look too much or too little, but it
[2:15:11] matches
[2:15:12] exactly with your current
[2:15:17] responsibilities.
[2:15:19] [Music]
[2:15:24] Sure.
[2:15:27] Sufficiency. Someone may have 100
[2:15:31] million. And it is
[2:15:34] sufficient. Have 1
[2:15:36] million and it is
[2:15:38] sufficient. It depends on the
[2:15:42] responsibility that the Lord has
[2:15:46] given. But The poorest of
[2:15:51] Christians must at least have food and
[2:15:56] clothing because having food
[2:16:00] enjoyment let us be
[2:16:03] content. So without food in the
[2:16:06] house, without clothing, I may God give
[2:16:10] you
[2:16:11] that poor you
[2:16:13] are ought to have
[2:16:17] that and God can provide
[2:16:20] it. The prophet says, "If I would
[2:16:24] probably taken the money that had been
[2:16:26] offered
[2:16:28] [Music]
[2:16:30] me, I would be an independent rich man.
[2:16:36] But today, as far as I know, I own this
[2:16:42] already
[2:16:47] truck out here about six
[2:16:55] years
[2:17:00] old, but for me it works for
[2:17:04] What am I trying to show you
[2:17:07] here? He
[2:17:12] needed not that he was rich. It was just
[2:17:16] sufficient. He said out here about six
[2:17:19] years old.
[2:17:24] Then listen and
[2:17:34] ach. Now listen what it is
[2:17:37] for. What he uses it
[2:17:41] for that I take my wife along in when I
[2:17:45] take her.
[2:17:58] this he had it for three
[2:18:01] years. He says that if I want to move
[2:18:03] with my wife to just drive her around, I
[2:18:07] bring the
[2:18:09] Pontia. But for you, even the you don't
[2:18:12] have it. Me, it works. It
[2:18:16] means if you need a certain to drive
[2:18:19] your wife
[2:18:26] around, God can give
[2:18:29] it. It is a
[2:18:32] need, not
[2:18:35] luxury, a need to
[2:18:48] him. I love the
[2:18:51] message. The prophet says, "I was born
[2:18:54] in a poor
[2:18:57] little but but by and
[2:19:01] by it was not in a little cabin
[2:19:06] anymore. It was now a nice
[2:19:10] house. Then he says, "I drive this
[2:19:14] old maybe my sons will drive
[2:19:20] some
[2:19:23] maybe." You see, he was
[2:19:26] contented but with
[2:19:28] ambitious. Contented but aiming higher.
[2:19:33] Contented but believingly
[2:19:35] promised. Oh,
[2:19:37] hallelujah. He
[2:19:39] says and the crosses that we
[2:19:43] have, what we have at
[2:19:45] home, that's all we
[2:19:48] own. That's right. Everything that we
[2:19:52] have.
[2:19:54] But I would rather live like that and
[2:19:56] have favor with
[2:20:01] God than the best than to have the best
[2:20:04] movie star home
[2:20:10] there. That's
[2:20:12] right. rather feel in my
[2:20:17] heart feeling the presence of
[2:20:20] Christ that I feel
[2:20:25] now than to have the riches of this
[2:20:29] world. I love
[2:20:31] him. He is
[2:20:34] wonderful. And he came to this
[2:20:37] world as my
[2:20:40] example as your
[2:20:43] example to just be
[2:20:47] content with such as we
[2:20:51] have. I would rather have
[2:20:55] Jesus than all these worldly
[2:21:01] things. True
[2:21:04] happiness comes from
[2:21:08] contentment because here we have no
[2:21:13] continuence. But we seek one to
[2:21:15] come. We are pilgrims and
[2:21:19] strangers wandering through this world
[2:21:21] of sin.
[2:21:24] The prophet says 1950
[2:21:27] 1950 here we have no
[2:21:30] continuing and
[2:21:32] listen
[2:21:33] happiness does not consist of how much
[2:21:36] of the world's goods you
[2:21:38] [Music]
[2:21:42] own but how contented you
[2:21:47] are with the portion allotted to
[2:21:53] Who all lots that
[2:21:55] portion? God allots that
[2:21:58] portion. I remember the prophet of God
[2:22:01] looked over and he
[2:22:03] saw the riches of Oral
[2:22:08] Roberts all that they had and say Lord
[2:22:13] you can't trust
[2:22:15] me things. I have a little small office.
[2:22:21] just
[2:22:23] there as he was still
[2:22:26] there. The Lord said, "I am your
[2:22:29] portion."
[2:22:33] Hallelujah. The heart the the the art of
[2:22:36] being
[2:22:39] happy. It lies in the power of
[2:22:42] extracting happiness.
[2:22:48] You extract happiness from common
[2:22:55] things within your
[2:23:00] [Music]
[2:23:02] means. Extract happiness from
[2:23:07] them. After all, it is the Lord that has
[2:23:10] given
[2:23:11] you even the little that you have.
[2:23:18] Contentment makes rich men
[2:23:24] poor.
[2:23:26] Discontentment makes rich men
[2:23:32] poor. Contentment makes poor
[2:23:38] content. It is the condition of the
[2:23:41] heart. That's all that matters.
[2:23:46] Discontented
[2:23:48] people are always trying to be something
[2:23:51] they are
[2:23:52] [Music]
[2:23:58] [Music]
[2:24:01] not. The wife lays burdens upon the
[2:24:05] husband. Husband lays burdens upon the
[2:24:08] wife.
[2:24:11] sure they
[2:24:12] know it's beyond their
[2:24:15] means. If you fail to trust
[2:24:19] God and pull and push each
[2:24:26] other don't do
[2:24:32] [Music]
[2:24:33] sedent to
[2:24:35] say I think this sister was not meant
[2:24:38] for me.
[2:24:41] I think I made a
[2:24:45] mistake. He doesn't want to go back
[2:24:51] home. You find him eating meat on the
[2:24:54] road. I can buy meat on the road and eat
[2:24:58] and eat my meat on the road.
[2:25:05] brother to buy and you walking
[2:25:10] it and my wife has not tasted it.
[2:25:14] It's not good.
[2:25:17] So she will say I think this is my
[2:25:23] husband the sister will start to say
[2:25:30] I wish God gave me a man like
[2:25:33] He's a beautiful man. He
[2:25:42] speak his voice is
[2:25:49] bad. Things
[2:25:52] happen when someone is not
[2:25:55] contented contented about their
[2:25:58] marriage. Contented about their
[2:26:00] marriage.
[2:26:03] I
[2:26:04] heard the sister was complaining about
[2:26:06] the
[2:26:08] brother complain about this and
[2:26:13] that until they
[2:26:16] separated not
[2:26:25] contented. The Bible
[2:26:29] says when I became a
[2:26:33] man
[2:26:36] things but when children get
[2:26:39] married they do childish
[2:26:44] things be
[2:26:46] mature. Be
[2:26:50] contented. Not contented.
[2:26:56] in the church. Not
[2:26:58] contented, not
[2:27:00] contented about the pastor, about the
[2:27:04] minister, about the brothers and
[2:27:06] sisters in the church, not
[2:27:10] comfortable, with the company of
[2:27:13] believers. You are not
[2:27:16] contented. Something is wrong.
[2:27:21] Brother,
[2:27:22] sister, be contented to be a
[2:27:26] wife and remain in your
[2:27:29] place. Husband,
[2:27:31] brother, be contented to be a
[2:27:34] father. Keep the
[2:27:37] children, no matter how many they
[2:27:40] are, listen. children. Many
[2:27:44] children don't make a money
[2:27:48] poor. They make a money
[2:27:51] rich. Listen, you can win your child to
[2:27:57] Christ. But you won't take the
[2:27:59] possessions of the world.
[2:28:02] That's far greater than the riches of
[2:28:10] man. Children don't make a money
[2:28:15] poor. They don't make a family
[2:28:18] crippled. They are a blessing.
[2:28:22] David says,
[2:28:24] [Applause]
[2:28:25] David says, "He that has
[2:28:29] many, they are like
[2:28:34] crowns."
[2:28:36] Amen. Brother, sister, be contented with
[2:28:40] your
[2:28:41] calling, knowing this that each one of
[2:28:46] us has been
[2:28:48] called with a higher calling.
[2:28:52] Simply aim
[2:28:55] higher to be the best version of
[2:29:02] yourself. Aim higher to be the best
[2:29:05] wife, your best husband, the best
[2:29:08] preacher, leader.
[2:29:11] Whenever of
[2:29:17] yourself, compete with yourself.
[2:29:20] [Music]
[2:29:23] compete with yourself
[2:29:32] until you get to the higher
[2:29:35] calling the mark of the high
[2:29:37] calling in your
[2:29:40] calling. A
[2:29:42] Christian we can worry we can complain
[2:29:46] as human beings but there is no just
[2:29:49] reason.
[2:29:51] to worry and
[2:29:53] complain though we know
[2:30:00] it
[2:30:01] is not just reason simply put God
[2:30:07] first seek God
[2:30:09] first and his righteousness then all
[2:30:12] these other
[2:30:14] things shall be added to
[2:30:16] you listen brother the Bible says says
[2:30:21] that the the
[2:30:23] Gentiles or people were not in
[2:30:26] Christ seek after these
[2:30:29] things. But behold the flowers of the
[2:30:33] field. Solomon was
[2:30:35] rich. Yet he was not dressed like one of
[2:30:41] them. The Lord trusted them. I remember
[2:30:45] my first
[2:30:46] preaching on a church par
[2:30:51] on a Sunday I was a poor boy
[2:30:56] then those days when I was young also
[2:31:00] I'm just a student like that I had just
[2:31:05] reason but it does not
[2:31:08] matter make any
[2:31:09] sense so I had no shirt to put
[2:31:15] on
[2:31:16] shirt long sleeve I didn't
[2:31:20] I didn't have any
[2:31:22] tie. You know, I went down and I prayed.
[2:31:25] I said, "God, I read it somewhere in the
[2:31:28] Bible where you told Moses, make
[2:31:32] garments for Aaron, for glory and for
[2:31:38] beauty." I said, "Lord, I need a
[2:31:44] sh for glory and for beauty.
[2:31:49] That night at
[2:31:51] 11, that night at
[2:31:55] 11, there's a neighbor came, a
[2:31:58] woman, help me, come help me do
[2:32:01] something, I went and he did that
[2:32:04] work. Brother, she paid
[2:32:07] me with money. The next time I got a job
[2:32:12] construction cuz I did those things,
[2:32:14] water engineering.
[2:32:18] So I did that. I got my money. I went
[2:32:22] and I bought a nice
[2:32:23] shirt. The brother gave me a
[2:32:26] [Music]
[2:32:33] nice look. Now look, it is common, very
[2:32:38] simple. It is simple. But it gave me
[2:32:41] happiness.
[2:32:46] Brother, he says the flowers the Lord
[2:32:50] dresses
[2:32:52] them of the field do not
[2:32:55] s but they are
[2:32:58] vested. It says, "Are you not much
[2:33:01] better than
[2:33:07] Let me tell
[2:33:09] you, it says Hebrews 13:5-6,
[2:33:15] let your conversation be without
[2:33:19] covetousness, and be content with such
[2:33:22] things as ye have, for he has said, I
[2:33:25] will never leave thee, nor forsake
[2:33:27] thee." Hebrews 13:5
[2:33:37] [Music]
[2:33:51] withh for he has said, "I will never
[2:33:54] leave thee, nor forsake thee."
[2:33:56] [Music]
[2:33:59] So that we may boldly say, "The Lord is
[2:34:02] my helper, and I will not fear what man
[2:34:05] shall do unto me.
[2:34:10] [Music]
[2:34:15] Just being
[2:34:19] content. God has made a
[2:34:23] promise. I'll never be norain.
[2:34:31] The cure of sin and
[2:34:35] envy is to find our contentment in
[2:34:39] [Music]
[2:34:42] God. Rejoice with those that
[2:34:46] rejoice but we don't do
[2:34:48] it because we
[2:34:51] feel what they have got or we we ought
[2:34:54] to have it
[2:34:57] too. But the scripture
[2:34:59] says in his
[2:35:02] time he has made all things
[2:35:12] beautiful in his
[2:35:15] time. Just be
[2:35:21] contented. If a man is going to be a
[2:35:24] street sweeper,
[2:35:28] He should sweep streets even as Michael
[2:35:31] Angel
[2:35:32] [Music]
[2:35:36] painted as Michael
[2:35:46] [Music]
[2:35:48] Angel as Shakespeare wrote a
[2:35:51] [Music]
[2:35:53] poet. He should sweep streets so
[2:35:57] well that all the hosts of
[2:36:02] heaven and
[2:36:08] earth will pause and
[2:36:12] say here lived a great street
[2:36:17] sweeper who did his job so well.
[2:36:25] I don't know what is your
[2:36:27] [Music]
[2:36:29] job. I don't know what is your job. But
[2:36:33] perhaps you can't do what I
[2:36:35] do. I can't do what you
[2:36:38] do. Do your job. So
[2:36:42] well you are the only one that can do
[2:36:44] it.
[2:36:46] So don't struggle to be like someone
[2:36:49] else.
[2:36:51] struggle to be the best version
[2:36:55] of Christian
[2:36:59] contentment. Christian
[2:37:03] contentment is having no higher
[2:37:07] [Music]
[2:37:08] ambition than it to belong to the
[2:37:11] [Music]
[2:37:13] Lord and to be entirely at his disposal.
[2:37:20] just exposed to the
[2:37:22] Lord entirely at the disposal of the
[2:37:26] Lord. What would thou have me
[2:37:29] do? Here I am. Spread out your
[2:37:35] petition before God. And then say, "Thy
[2:37:40] will not mind."
[2:37:48] The sweetest lesson I've
[2:37:51] learned is God is a
[2:37:54] school to let the Lord choose for
[2:38:03] me. Look,
[2:38:06] brother, Philippians 4:6
[2:38:08] says, "Be careful for
[2:38:11] nothing, but in everything by prayer and
[2:38:14] supplication,
[2:38:17] with
[2:38:19] thanksgiving. Let your
[2:38:22] requests be made known unto
[2:38:27] God with
[2:38:29] prayer and
[2:38:31] supplication, with
[2:38:34] thanksgiving. Let your request be made
[2:38:37] known unto God.
[2:38:42] There's a song we
[2:38:43] sing
[2:38:47] says all because we do not
[2:38:55] [Music]
[2:38:57] carry. We don't take all things to God
[2:39:01] in
[2:39:03] prayer. Then he says, "And the peace of
[2:39:08] God which passes all
[2:39:11] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[2:39:13] mind through
[2:39:15] Christ." God God wants you to
[2:39:19] walk moment by
[2:39:23] moment, moment by moment, depending on
[2:39:26] the Holy Spirit.
[2:39:32] That's why we sing that
[2:39:34] song one day at a time. Sweet
[2:39:39] Jesus. That's all I'm asking
[2:39:43] for. Help me today to do every day. What
[2:39:48] you love me to one day at a time.
[2:39:51] Yesterday's gone. Tomorrow may never be
[2:39:53] mine.
[2:39:56] Sufficient unto the day is the evil
[2:40:02] thereof. For the moral will take care of
[2:40:05] [Music]
[2:40:07] itself. We need
[2:40:10] it. The people say, if I had a little
[2:40:14] more,
[2:40:16] brother, I should be very
[2:40:19] satisfied. And you make a mistake with
[2:40:22] us. If you're not content,
[2:40:25] with what you have. You would not be
[2:40:29] satisfied if it was
[2:40:32] doubled. Remember, he that is
[2:40:35] faithful in little things shall be given
[2:40:40] over big
[2:40:41] [Music]
[2:40:43] things. We need it.
[2:40:48] If I had some
[2:40:50] more of this, of that, I will be
[2:40:54] satisfied. I'll be
[2:40:57] content. You have got to do it
[2:40:59] [Music]
[2:41:01] now. Show
[2:41:04] proof that you are glad
[2:41:09] to the Lord.
[2:41:12] I remember
[2:41:15] Napoleon the great Alexander
[2:41:19] Napoleon was such a great
[2:41:23] conqueror. He conquered the world. He
[2:41:26] conquered many
[2:41:28] nations the prophet says he reached a
[2:41:33] point conquered the entire
[2:41:35] world and he looked there was no more
[2:41:39] place to conquer.
[2:41:41] and he wept because there was no more
[2:41:45] place to
[2:41:49] conquer. No matter how great a conqueror
[2:41:52] he
[2:41:54] was, he still was not
[2:41:57] content because
[2:42:00] contentment is a Christian
[2:42:04] virtue. Alex is under the great how
[2:42:08] great a rich man he was.
[2:42:10] How great a conqueror he
[2:42:13] was. But the territory is
[2:42:16] hard. He died
[2:42:19] miserable because of
[2:42:22] discontentment. But he learned a
[2:42:25] lesson that I can carry nothing out of
[2:42:27] this
[2:42:29] world. Neither does there anything that
[2:42:31] can save a
[2:42:33] man from the chains of death.
[2:42:37] But I'm so glad this
[2:42:39] morning that the sting of
[2:42:42] death, the Lord Jesus Christ set us
[2:42:44] free.
[2:42:46] And we are glad
[2:42:48] today. I am
[2:42:50] contented. Let death
[2:42:52] come. I am
[2:42:54] contented. Because he lives. I confess
[2:42:58] tomorrow.
[2:43:00] And because I know he holds the
[2:43:04] future in the message Africa trip
[2:43:09] report the prophet was there. Remember
[2:43:12] he had gone out of the will of
[2:43:14] God willfully
[2:43:17] knowing he was drove into
[2:43:21] it. He got into a
[2:43:24] fix and God gave him a permissive
[2:43:27] will. But God said you will
[2:43:30] suffer and he got an amba from
[2:43:34] there. Went back home for over six
[2:43:38] months sick and down and
[2:43:41] crawling because he went out of the will
[2:43:45] of
[2:43:46] God and praying and
[2:43:49] repenting weeping and calling upon the
[2:43:51] Lord.
[2:43:53] Then he started to think about the
[2:43:55] future.
[2:43:57] He said, "I wonder what is the future
[2:43:59] holding for
[2:44:01] me? Is this my
[2:44:03] end? I don't know. I'm so He was
[2:44:08] meditating. I don't know what really the
[2:44:11] future
[2:44:13] holds as he was still
[2:44:15] meditating. You know, it's good to
[2:44:17] meditate upon the things of God.
[2:44:26] Then the angel of the Lord
[2:44:28] came in a vision
[2:44:31] and he
[2:44:32] said, "In as much as you are meditating
[2:44:36] about your
[2:44:40] future, the future is
[2:44:43] clear.
[2:44:45] Hallelujah. The future is
[2:44:48] clear. The waters are clear.
[2:44:52] about how far we go, how long we stay
[2:44:57] here, everything is
[2:45:02] clear. The children of Israel when they
[2:45:05] were in the wilderness, they really
[2:45:07] failed to see
[2:45:10] God what he was doing. They failed to
[2:45:13] see it. They were not contented with the
[2:45:17] mana. They were not contented with the
[2:45:19] water from the rock.
[2:45:22] And that blinded
[2:45:24] them to see what God was
[2:45:27] doing. It happens to people
[2:45:34] today. This
[2:45:37] contentment in most of the things of
[2:45:41] life, we don't have to be that
[2:45:44] way. We ought to learn to be
[2:45:47] contented. Discontented about spiritual
[2:45:49] gifts.
[2:45:52] discontented about
[2:45:54] ministries you but just have to be
[2:45:58] contented about the
[2:46:01] portion that God has allotted to
[2:46:03] you because God knows what exactly fits
[2:46:11] you I'm done now we can stand on our
[2:46:15] feet that the
[2:46:17] people don't enjoy to be
[2:46:21] contented because they
[2:46:24] think being
[2:46:26] contented is being
[2:46:31] weak. But it is
[2:46:35] strength. Brothers and sisters, in this
[2:46:39] simplicity, learn to trust
[2:46:41] God. Depend upon his
[2:46:44] word. Always be thankful.
[2:46:48] I come to God with
[2:46:51] thanksgiving knowing and
[2:46:54] believing that your life is in God's
[2:46:58] hand and nothing will ever get out of
[2:47:03] place. Whatever God has prepared for
[2:47:07] you, you will have
[2:47:10] it. You will have
[2:47:12] it.
[2:47:13] Amen. I'm done with this.
[2:47:17] You know
[2:47:21] the word of God,
[2:47:26] just something small from the word of
[2:47:30] God is enough.
[2:47:48] [Music]
[2:47:59] [Music]
[2:48:07] Mess is a yes.
[2:48:12] This holy

[2:53:40] Thanksgiving this
[2:53:43] afternoon. If you have a
[2:53:45] need, maybe you are
[2:53:47] sick. It has given you this
[2:53:51] comfort. It is true. It's really
[2:53:55] troubles. I know what it is to be
[2:53:58] sick in the body and something for
[2:54:03] long. I know what it is.
[2:54:07] But the Bible says it's only Jesus that
[2:54:11] is the charge of the
[2:54:14] fear. He knows to help those who are
[2:54:16] tempted.
[2:54:19] made me
[2:54:21] temptations down in the Lord
[2:54:25] of you have come in the presence of
[2:54:28] God. You have come in the house of

[2:54:37] Jesus. Here I am. Help me father. Give
[2:54:42] me
[2:54:43] contentment. Teach me Lord to wait down
[2:54:47] on my knees.
[2:54:49] in your own good time. You answer my

[2:54:58] others wait in
[2:55:00] prayer for an answer from
[2:55:03] you. Lord Jesus
[2:55:07] Christ of the

[2:56:24] timeless need of the Holy Spirit.
[2:56:28] They are so
[2:56:33] uncomfortable. Maybe it is a

[2:56:38] school. Whatever it may be, thou
[2:56:41] knowest.
[2:56:43] You promised to supply all our

[3:01:30] officially
[3:01:34] tomorrow. So, we have the little ones
[3:01:36] and those in high
[3:01:42] schools. I've also learned of others who
[3:01:44] have already
[3:01:45] [Music]
[3:01:48] reported. Yeah.
[3:01:50] Shall we pray? Precious Lord Jesus,
[3:01:54] Father, we thank you for your love that
[3:01:56] you have bestow toward us
[3:02:00] Lord. We are here Lord Jesus just as
[3:02:03] attributes of your
[3:02:07] love. And Lord, we know how that love
[3:02:10] compelled you in the beginning and you
[3:02:12] came down and redeemed us.
[3:02:19] Father God, we're remembering our
[3:02:20] children who have gone back to school
[3:02:21] and those will be going or others are
[3:02:24] leaving today and others
[3:02:29] tomorrow. We dedicate them at your
[3:02:32] hands.
[3:02:34] We know we are sending them father amid
[3:02:37] billions of
[3:02:41] demons. We've seen others battling with
[3:02:44] uh battling with
[3:02:48] habits and we know there a lot of things
[3:02:50] happening in school
[3:02:53] today and here we are bringing our
[3:02:57] children. We ask you that Lord you cover
[3:02:59] them with the blood of Jesus.
[3:03:02] It's our prayer that you blind them from
[3:03:04] the things of the
[3:03:07] world and you'll always capture their
[3:03:10] hearts
[3:03:12] Lord and every day will prepare their
[3:03:15] heart to receive from you.
[3:03:19] Pray for each father, for all the
[3:03:20] parents who are
[3:03:22] here that God you'll meet their needs.
[3:03:26] Lord, you provide us with fees for our
[3:03:29] children and other needs. Lord
[3:03:33] Jesus, precious father, king of
[3:03:36] kings. We thank you for the vessel you
[3:03:39] have used this
[3:03:40] day. We ask you that you refresh him,
[3:03:43] Lord. You continue anointing him, Lord.
[3:03:48] Bless our interpreting brother.
[3:03:51] We ask that Lord the Holy Spirit will
[3:03:53] refresh him.
[3:03:54] Lord, you told us not only be the
[3:03:57] hearers of the
[3:03:59] word, the doers of the
[3:04:02] word and one thing we know Lord
[3:04:05] Jesus. We cannot do without you
[3:04:08] Lord. But you gave us a promise in your
[3:04:11] word that when he the Holy Ghost is
[3:04:14] come, you will quicken father our mortal
[3:04:17] bodies.
[3:04:19] Precious father, you will teach us, will
[3:04:21] lead us to all
[3:04:23] things. May that spirit quicken each one
[3:04:26] of
[3:04:27] us to believe every
[3:04:30] word and to act upon it Lord
[3:04:33] Jesus that father all our children will
[3:04:36] be concerned about what they have heard.
[3:04:41] Lord, may you help us to be contented
[3:04:43] with what you have given
[3:04:45] us, putting you as our
[3:04:49] example because we know that thou, Lord
[3:04:53] Jesus, you are the mark of the holy
[3:04:57] calling. As we believe in this place,
[3:05:00] Lord
[3:05:01] Jesus, may you go with each one of us,
[3:05:03] Lord.
[3:05:05] May the pillar of fire divide himself
[3:05:07] among us as
[3:05:09] Lord. We pray for our pastor where he is
[3:05:13] Lord that your grace will continue using
[3:05:17] him. May you lead him
[3:05:20] father. Use him in the mighty
[3:05:23] way and we believe that Lord you are
[3:05:25] using him
[3:05:26] [Music]
[3:05:28] already. Remember his family Lord Jesus.
[3:05:32] May you bless them. King of
[3:05:34] glory. You bless each one of us.
[3:05:37] Lord, the ministers of this
[3:05:40] church, the late Lord
[3:05:43] Jesus, our families, Jehovah
[3:05:46] God. May you fight our
[3:05:49] battles. Father, we bless your loving
[3:05:53] name. We turn the glory and honor to
[3:05:56] you in the most precious name of the
[3:05:58] Lord Jesus Christ.
[3:06:01] remember our overnight Lord Jesus.
[3:06:05] May you prepare us
[3:06:06] Lord in Christ Jesus we pray.
[3:06:11] Amen.
[3:06:16] May the Lord bless you so
[3:06:17] much. We've come to the end of our
[3:06:21] service. Just want to bring to your
[3:06:22] attention our Friday
[3:06:27] overnight. kindly let us come in big
[3:06:32] number. I remember the first overnight
[3:06:34] the whole church was
[3:06:39] packed. And just imagine we have one in
[3:06:43] a
[3:06:46] month. So let's sacrifice and
[3:06:51] come. Uh the word of God tells
[3:06:55] us that you should seek him while he's
[3:06:57] still
[3:06:59] near. And somewhere he
[3:07:01] says because I called
[3:07:03] you and did it not answer
[3:07:08] me. You'll also call
[3:07:11] me and I will not
[3:07:14] answer. So
[3:07:17] brethren, it's later than we
[3:07:20] think. The rapture is just
[3:07:24] here. So we need
[3:07:26] to try our
[3:07:29] best to serve God while we are still
[3:07:35] strong. A few days ago, I was reading
[3:07:37] the
[3:07:40] message resurrection and
[3:07:43] life and the prophet was
[3:07:45] saying that when you
[3:07:49] die the only
[3:07:51] thing that will make you
[3:07:53] resurrect is what you did for God when
[3:07:56] you are still
[3:07:59] alive. But if you have nothing you can
[3:08:01] point
[3:08:05] onto forget about
[3:08:09] resurrection.
[3:08:12] So we
[3:08:17] are that we do our best
[3:08:21] while in this
[3:08:23] life. So Friday,
[3:08:26] let's come
[3:08:27] early time with the Lord.
[3:08:31] And also I want
[3:08:33] to bring this to you also,
[3:08:37] brethren. Yeah. Let us try to always
[3:08:40] manage
[3:08:45] time. is not a must that you must come
[3:08:48] at
[3:08:49] 10, come a little bit
[3:08:56] earlier. All of us at least have gone
[3:08:58] through schools. Even others are still
[3:09:00] in
[3:09:04] school. Nobody enters class when the
[3:09:07] teachers already teaching unless they
[3:09:13] disobedient. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[3:09:16] But here the God, the creator of heaven
[3:09:18] and earth, he has called us. God bless
[3:09:22] you.
[3:09:26] I didn't speak those words to hurt you,
[3:09:30] but I've spoken them
[3:09:32] enough. You come and you dismissed
[3:09:43] Godless. Because he
