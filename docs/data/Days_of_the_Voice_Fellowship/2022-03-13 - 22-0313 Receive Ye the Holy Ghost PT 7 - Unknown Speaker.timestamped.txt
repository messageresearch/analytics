[1:10:32] so the
[1:10:33] brother marvin preached a very good
[1:10:35] summon
[1:10:38] very good summoner
[1:10:40] amen
[1:10:56] he spoke about the promises that god has
[1:10:58] given to us
[1:11:02] they say that god has given the promises
[1:11:05] that whatever it is up to us
[1:11:08] today to claim those promises
[1:11:25] you have to claim your promises
[1:11:28] of you if i tell you this is yours
[1:11:32] then you should claim it
[1:11:35] if i tell you it is yours
[1:11:37] brother this phone is all going to see
[1:11:40] when you're you and i put it in my
[1:11:41] pocket 90 day come on so
[1:11:43] is it yours
[1:11:47] can you answer me church
[1:11:50] is it yourself
[1:12:07] and that's how many of us are where do
[1:12:10] you have a singer when god gives us his
[1:12:12] promises
[1:12:14] we we just look at them
[1:12:17] and we say we believe in it
[1:12:19] to be kidding we accept it
[1:12:23] amen but we don't claim it need it to be
[1:12:25] banned
[1:12:26] and so god has promised to us
[1:12:29] give us the desires of our hearts
[1:12:31] [Music]
[1:12:33] someone told me that why do you collect
[1:12:36] maybe the rapture will happen
[1:12:42] will happen
[1:12:44] but if the rapture happens
[1:12:46] i do not want to be found folding my
[1:13:02] i think to me that is a good thing
[1:13:08] because
[1:13:10] the rapture will still happen
[1:13:13] whether or not you collect money
[1:13:45] and god will give to us according to our
[1:13:47] faith cartoon that that took a video
[1:13:49] with two kids
[1:13:50] you grow old okay you have children
[1:13:54] get married
[1:13:56] you're still renting in a school
[1:13:58] bank
[1:14:31] it is not
[1:14:33] your work as an individual
[1:14:36] it is the work of god
[1:14:39] and if you give to the lord
[1:14:42] you have learned
[1:14:43] the lord you have left the lord
[1:14:46] and you can never let him take the
[1:14:48] sabbath
[1:14:49] and he can that you can never pay back
[1:14:54] i want to challenge you as a church
[1:14:56] jagarabbas
[1:14:58] that do all you can to sacrifice collect
[1:15:00] your natural suburbs
[1:15:02] and give towards this cause
[1:15:06] if you have to sacrifice
[1:15:23] of us here have children bandicoot
[1:15:26] um i see several families with children
[1:15:27] and others are getting married
[1:15:31] we have two weddings in may alone
[1:15:35] hallelujah
[1:15:53] i believe we shall be dedicated in the
[1:15:55] other one very soon
[1:15:58] tomorrow
[1:15:59] and soon he will have three maybe as i
[1:16:01] don't know
[1:16:02] and maybe i don't know obama
[1:16:15] this place cannot be enough for us
[1:16:18] we
[1:16:32] behind that
[1:16:46] and
[1:17:00] praise the lord
[1:17:03] so these are things that we don't speak
[1:17:04] about much you know they have
[1:17:06] intervention
[1:17:08] but i thought i should really bring down
[1:17:10] my burden to you
[1:17:14] because the lord has already proved to
[1:17:15] us
[1:17:17] it's going to work
[1:17:19] we are standing in his word 20 minutes
[1:17:22] so those of you who raised up your hands
[1:17:26] and have not given anything oh
[1:17:37] you may have promised two hundred
[1:17:38] thousand a month of course
[1:17:41] and maybe you didn't get it in lump sum
[1:17:44] and you kept on saying i will give you i
[1:17:47] will give you i will give you
[1:17:49] how long has it taken
[1:17:51] if you've been abandoned
[1:17:54] and you've given maybe nothing
[1:18:07] last time you you spoke in the church
[1:18:09] publicly you said every day can collect
[1:18:11] this much sister
[1:18:16] i was going to ask you whether how much
[1:18:17] you are living
[1:18:21] praise the lord come here
[1:18:45] um
[1:18:46] and i i think there's somebody who told
[1:18:48] me they gave last time and they were
[1:18:49] never raped
[1:18:57] we have collected eight million and four
[1:19:00] hundred forty nine thousand
[1:19:03] zero
[1:19:05] [Music]
[1:19:43] hallelujah
[1:19:45] many believers don't want to hear things
[1:19:48] about money
[1:19:52] but the more they do not want to hear
[1:19:54] about them
[1:19:57] the more they do not progress
[1:20:01] you see what i love about god he's a
[1:20:03] changer
[1:20:04] his word has principles
[1:20:07] you stand by his principles
[1:20:10] and he blesses you
[1:20:13] there's a principle in giving what went
[1:20:15] on
[1:20:27] and so we are progressing to vienna
[1:20:30] there are now many ways
[1:21:07] hallelujah
[1:21:09] is that laughter meaning you have faith
[1:21:11] oh it means you are doubting it
[1:21:50] we can be able to move in a place where
[1:21:53] whether we are finished or not
[1:22:07] dreaming i'm not dreaming i'm speaking
[1:22:08] reality
[1:22:21] oh yeah god bless you amen stand with me
[1:22:25] on your feet
