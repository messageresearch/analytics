========================================

[Applause] [Music] we may [Music] [Music] i [Music] oh [Music] lift up your voice and worship all of this [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] i know [Music] [Laughter] [Music] foreign [Music] yes [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] let him come [Music] thank you jesus [Music] bless you [Music] i you jesus oh hallelujah [Music] yes [Music] yes my jesus [Music] [Music] my [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh lift up your hands and tell him one more time [Music] [Music] let the words of my mouth [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] loving jesus yes i pray as we come before you this evening the meditation [Music] are our strengths and we believe that when we come before him you are able to strengthen our mind father may you take the service [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and we are reading once again from is and jesus walking by the sea of galilee saw true brethren simon called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers and is he saith unto them follow me and i will make you fishers of men and they straight away left their nets and followed him and and going on from thence he saw other two brethren james the son of zebedee and john his brother in a ship with zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them and they immediately left the ship and their father and followed him mangua ago nevada i'm speaking on the sobering experience of the upper room and this is going to be a part 2. and we talked about a little bit of it on sunday and it's good to see those who have uh were here tonight amen that's what joy is and i thought that this is a good subject to speak about after we had spent a few weeks talking about the calling forever [Music] [Music] is one thing but to stay and to abide in your coding is another [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] others the bible says that this so and so found grace in the sight of god [Music] for so long we can be in the church for so long but you see that does not mean that you have become super naive and this by the way is their greatest hindrance to christianity [Music] and then you also come driving with your alcohol smelling all over your mouth with you everyone and now they simply put a tester and they tell you breathe and then if you have alcohol in your system the machine catches [Music] they may be speaking in tongues they may be shouting in the holy grail but as long as they cannot pass the word test now these three these men the disciples of jesus christ they they sat under the ministry of jesus christ of three years and a half but at the end of it all he can be a greater they forgot the purpose for why they were called jesus called them from being fishers of men to being from being fishers of fish to being fishers of men and like i told you on sunday jesus question was not to disappoint [Applause] jesus is not that you wanted to be amen you are not cheap holy allies hallelujah amina i am not cheap this is the city where i see you are not cheap every seed of god is not cheap yeah [Applause] come and follow i'm going to make it brighter nature praise the name of the lord there is no loss [Music] i said there is no loss [Music] there's someone here who believes that in a while wearing those big robes i thought it was the best thing to do to be closer to god he told amina praise the name of the lord come here hallelujah amina the then the bible tells us here when the bible that these is have said i know one day of course after the death of jesus they were no longer with him and one day peter was there repeatedly and he felt like going to fish he felt like going back in his old life in church that's the worst decision you will ever not to live your you are going to be worse than you were when you were there in the first place and jesus came and asked them yes give me a little feedback they said no i got my name we didn't catch nothing we went through that on sunday told them to cast on the right side that they shall find but i want to skip all that because we talked about on when is on sunday [Music] basement the mushy taker once which is him and the only fire you have got left is in the basement you see what we need what we need is an old upper room experience this is exactly what this disciples needed [Applause] this man had jesus is the best teacher that the world has ever seen i don't know jesus went in again and they remained alone some of them have even sweared we will never leave you where are you going we will go nothing some of them and on that day when he was going to be taken away by the scribes and the pharisees told them to bring whatever they had again everybody knowing their hearts listen to this brother don't say it i wanted to preach it they had simply received the encounter with the man by the performances they had received an encounter with the man jesus with the ministry of jesus the word they had not yet received an encounter with the life that was in jesus name i can actually even show you know sometimes there are those that want to show that there are more believers than others and peter was one of them and when the man cut off his ears jesus looked at peter yesterday take a look at jesus jesus pick the ear yes and he put it back is not to be taken lightly it's a spiritual thing being to be among you it's to be taken spiritually you the only way we are going to abide in our calling is to receive the holy spirit of the upper room encounters if god requires sincerity and then if god requires a sacrifice to god what do you want [Music] beautiful the beauty of holiness is where god dwells in cattle we are the power of the holy spirit [Music] hallelujah praise the name of allah coming and by the way that is from honestly contending for the faith [Music] people don't walk and people don't walk anyhow as crippled as the church is around he says your faith is your crush there will never be an organization ever substitute the upper room experience [Music] friends i'm sorry you may come and attend the church they give you offerings you but the moment he came back to his senses he said he noticed he had gone there together that at that moment he would have lost his life and then what matters there will never be a school will never will ever take place at pentecost not by power not by might but my by my spiritual ethos that's what we need today [Music] twice born i say amen lord give it to me this is what the world needs today is a revival an all-time revival imagine the disciples were always here and today they never found sure purpose before the upper room encountered [Music] an upper room encounter whatever it is you are even worse than the unbelievers [Music] help me understand what i'm talking about and he says literally like in our language you would say word go when the word remember we can say i will die for you peter said that prayer did he mean it directed this do you love me i will not leave you is [Applause] [Music] faithfully fire by denying him away god why what he had not yet received that encounter hallelujah that's a man before they receive the holocaust i wanted to paint a picture for you that a man before they received the holocaust they can do anything can do anything and what we need is the holy ghost you need to receive an encounter with our goal for insisting and a little old sellers of purple women and those gathered themselves in an upper room do you think i really want to come well i want to preach to you and shout and move on to your name then get back and be very wary it's out of duty if i don't do it i i am bound to do it and there are many many hundreds of millions like me in the world [Applause] but these were sent to men in a reality to me to everyone to why watch it because it is the only man that can receive an emperor encounters our guru it's only men they will be headed for the tribulation the tribulation is as real as we are here right now i was just hearing news today i think they don't know and nobody will make taiwan uh uh away from them or like is it [Music] bath pain and you see the walls and rumors of walls everywhere and uh you know very well that this actually will be leading towards what the bible promise would be moment of bible diseases in what day many of these are caused even by men but somewhere in the upper room somewhere amen and then fill them with the holy ghost all right and then send them back again in the world ah the sin became a demon you go and be fishers of men how about you too i said no god bless you no i'm coming amen no i've decided no one from what the lord has done for me that i'm going to be a part of this question no no you are true man of god you are a true prophet your message is correct it is from name is food so come here and from today this will be my home channel [Applause] another brother [Music] but in this case i want us to look at noah and his ark as he is where he heard the message of the hour when the world was so civilized the world until today has not yet reached the civilization [Applause] pyramid of giza pyramid in egypt mystery you know we can talk about that pyramid one day actually according to history no one knows who built that pyramid ariana and these pyramids are all built almost in the same fashion but these other pyramids will be able to put the pharaohs that are that were dead and uh you know they had they made they made the mummies and they put them in there but you see this great pyramid that is kinds it stands in the true north of the world when you see all the characteristics that make up that pyramid is so heavy to your neighbor pyramiding you will find that it so much directs people to nature with so much shows and points to uh to to to what already god blessed in the skies and no one knows who built that pyramid all these archaeologists and science and uh historians they don't know how [Music] there's a lot to talk about that pyramid one day i'll take time and you know when is the service and talk about it but here we receive a prophet in this end time who gave us an answer that the world does not know where that even the great scientists and historians don't have a crisis i was the one that he uses well then he says he build that pyramid that pyramid was built it had to be a prospect [Music] [Music] they came civilization with all the civilizations we have to turn the technology they cannot even rebuild the pyramid of visa organization which means the technology and the science and the civilization that was there in the days of law by now the one we have that was greater than ours this one ain't no not even god himself can sink naked and on its first foreign was having a different message just like the message we have today is so different and it makes sometimes the believers feel as if oh how will the world look at us doing makeup is beautiful making up yourself to beautify yourself and we know that the life of the devil i think that to my neighbor was turned it is not beautifying yourself secretly if you do makeup attack on the way actually it's not a new thing do you know that makeup has not come because of technology technology yes yes makeup was here even before technology make up technology all the heathens in europe europe all these native tribes you know in ireland maryland before they all received christ they were painting themselves they were in karamoja recently american cow trolley calamari you can even see the believers who were who believed uh brotherhood believed after having thrown to a certain degree with the purana ethiopia and and even as you go into those remote remote areas you find they will paint themselves like cops they will pierce themselves pieces of their bodies they will put things on their ears to and i don't care whether you call yourself a christian or a child of god see foreign there [Music] do with all the demons and spirits over here the devil has made himself the angel of life satan here foreign spirits and demons have come even in chuckles and these days even men are as it were as if they were full of demons saying they are giving praise to the lord over 10 years putting their lips up never when you kill me full of blood and i'm sure you know that part of the ingredients that make those makeup is some parts of human beings cannibals [Music] you see the shock the seat somehow needs the shock sometimes uh on that day [Applause] that's why let me tell you even if you are only one in a nation standing for the truth standing for the word of god never be ashamed to declare the word of truth foreign the world had the rumors forgetting about my children i've been coming around to see how to rescue no one is falling that noah has lost his mind family in danger of trying [Music] [Music] coming you see it was already seen in science years ago that the weather could change because of global warming [Music] they had predicted very bad babies that might drop a little bit after all never it's not a really new thing let's see how things will go hello [Music] the story [Music] and so now oh [Music] [Music] why are you about in your knee i'm sure water levels reached kakasam but even those in their airplanes with the technology of that technology they themselves did not survive went hallelujah event like that finances is coming yet now and god is preparing his people take attention hallelujah amen this time not water will not [Music] oh i know where i am standing money watching you i know in human beings experience is not an option for me which are corrupt this is not an option for me he gives you a supernatural power aquaman you live beyond yourself oh yeah there are things you can no longer do you want to wear it together because [Music] they heresy was by the lord of god this is a very important time for us to be here and hear the word time comes again and soon it will be it actually complete when we can't hear the word acts chapter 2 verse 1. and when the day of pentecost was fully calm now then you know the soul they were all in with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clubbing trunks like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterances [Music] [Music] without this you are headed straight for the tribulation don't you ever think that it's going to be a light moment because it will not be better but even the tribulation is not the worst praise the name of the lord name come and there be some who say well thank god even if i don't make it for the rapture i might be the tribulation saints the worst now and when you lose your sloth trouble watching your calling it's gone it's done for you chickens [Music] some of you people walking along saying well i just can't quit drinking well i just can't quit please i felt as a young man [Applause] you dishonor your husband if you cut away you see why the holy ghost will make you stop cutting your hair i'm going to talk about ejaculating oh come here to make you quit wearing shorts and slacks your sister i just put your combat over you know they wear those [Applause] that oh yes [Music] you will follow the instructions of the bible every [Music] foreign but there is no excuses with the holy ghost it is there to make it so oh my god it will follow the word just exactly it will make your man turn your head away from those half-naked women i generated we begin to bubble up [Music] in my heart and all these other things that you do around the corner of your nervous side of your korean waste you make you quit carrying on the way you are doing something living untrue to your wife that's what you will do to check your colleagues make you quit wanting to marry somebody else's wife and but when you look b he went back to fishing that doesn't have a religion
