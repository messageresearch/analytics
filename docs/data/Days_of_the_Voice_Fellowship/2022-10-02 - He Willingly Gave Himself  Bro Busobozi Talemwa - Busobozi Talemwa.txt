sparking down we are not slowing down revive yourselves God bless you come back home survive yourselves amen and God will bless you chapter 2 verse 11. and uh I have something that the Lord laid on my heart to share with you today and uh we are reading from 11 to 25. Summer is for the grace of God that bringeth salvation has appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lasts we should leave somebody righteously and godly in the in this present world looking for that blessed hope and glory and glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify excuse me and purify unto himself are peculiar people Silas of good words this thing speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise thee foreign [Music] praise the name of the Lord so while I was waiting on the Lord on what to speak on whenever I heard those words God loved us so much that he willingly gave himself and so this morning I'd like to speak to you on that he willingly gave himself he willingly gave himself he willingly gave himself praise the name of the Lord I need a little more voice from you amen I trust that you have left all your problems on the door this morning and uh uh who is going to put me this morning who is going to preach with me this morning you're gonna say amen [Music] and let the Lord speak to us this morning I believe in the Lord that's why I left the denomination because I don't believe in that coldness coldness is usually in the mortuary grace of God he says for the grace of God that bringeth salvation has appeared to all men for the grace of God bring a Salvation not you that brings salvation to yourself it is the grace of God that brings salvation think about it for a moment you can't save yourself you are as bad as they can get you see you you are seen as anybody can be the grace of God don't you salvation amen it has appeared to all men the grace of God foreign [Applause] Jesus Christ teaches us to leave somebody and she said you know to live righteously in this present world and what are we doing we are doing all these things looking unto that blessed hope you love your neck to be called yo the Glorious appearing of our great God and our savior the Lord Jesus Christ who is our God our God is not something we cannot see for something which we have never seen praise the name of the Lord our God is somebody who came down from Glory I believe in a human flesh just like we're living and his name is Jesus yes Jesus was God yes Jesus Is God Jesus will always be gone Hallelujah Amina so Jesus when he came down on Earth 30 years it was not working in that body yeah Jesus was not just somebody's son yes Jesus was the god the great God Of Heaven yes God himself came and put on flesh and that flesh was called his son Jesus when Jesus was walking that yes his death remove death permanently oh God foreign [Music] Hallelujah [Applause] husbands love your wives [Music] giving us Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it Christ loved the church he gave himself for the church you know when when a man loves his wife or massage he gives himself especially a boy or a man before they uh they finalize their agreements with the girl um [Applause] because he wants to make his desire known the God is going on another way but the boy is around himself he can do anything to win her life [Applause] he loved her yeah [Music] what's up foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] you know [Applause] as if the sin was theirselves they eat themselves foreign [Applause] he wants to give himself to you wait why he wants to make himself known to you God loved us so much that he willingly gave himself and I will not be long this morning I always say that and sometimes I'm wrong but I hope I will not be wrong so if it wasn't for his actions we would still be Sinners we would still be lost we would be unloved we would be hopeless but I want to tell you this morning and love song you have no reason of feeling lost foreign that you said we are we all come to the world speaking lies saved by grace and that's why church this morning I want us to appreciate they're gonna have to see me what the word Jesus Christ yes Christian has done for us in this house he has willingly given himself to us you know you're willingly he willingly without being forced come up here come come right yes you're wondering I'm not brother Adam but your brother Adam now Adam was in sin and he hid himself somewhere and Adam was there really was hiding his face okay and he was having his wife with him the brother's wife is still with him and he was hiding right there but I want to show you what love is what Grace is and that's why sometimes we preach things you think you don't need it is [Applause] only crying and hiding himself but when God came he began from wherever he was standing yeah foreign you can only seek after a God who has already sought after him hallelujah amen he sold for us give us that stand he says he loved me before I knew him and all my love is due here he plunged me to Victory the cleansing flowers it is his action not ours because when I look at myself he said we need to know leader I seek insufficient I say helplessness because never sitting up your army I have broken heart um but when I look at him I can now say I know he truly loves me he willingly gave himself to become a ransom for all yeah and the church sometimes has become a hindrance to receive Christ when God came down and he looked so everybody was pointing at somebody and sometimes when the Lord comes down to reach down your hands you begin quitting at some others and others Point At You they sometimes others behave as if they're holier than others look at somebody as if they are seen as a new you are better than them but here today who is spiritual praise the name of the Lord well nobody said I'm spiritual but yet during the week you will be pointing at somebody that is the Cardinal Brothers that brother is not even saved that brother should even be fired because it's not good so this morning I want to approach you if you have that attitude that God gave himself we're insufficient priority all of us were helpless we are sinners all of us couldn't we are hell-bounds but when he came and he gave himself he for us we did not force him ask him but why are we here we are not here by asking 41. yeah you are not here by accident sister 31 you are not here you are here by Design [Applause] you are here because God gave himself for you [Applause] and you realized it again oh God has given himself for me I am a part of him you also gave him your heart and I'd like you today to give your hand to the Lord Jesus because he already has given his hand to him of the two five he says for there is one God and one mediator between God and man the man in Christ Jesus who gave himself for a random for all you could say if he was speaking from the grave or Moon he would say I am the first and the last foreign and is alive so this is not a man speaking oh now you get a Simon too that's your your proof that Jesus is God he was not a man speaking I didn't even try again yes Jesus was a hundred percent man after he died and rose again but now I am alive so this is not a man speaking this is God this is deity man Adam took life and turned it into death but this man Jesus and turned it into life yet most of you feel guilty many times I'll speak to you right now some of you might be feeling guilty about something can we sing it for a moment yes our Lord is coming back to us our Lord is coming back the other words [Music] A Thousand Years we'll have no tempted in after Jesus shall come back to earth one more time our Lord our Lord is coming back party in our Lord is coming back to Earth was certain now Saturn will be bound a thousand years we have no time today after Jesus shall come back to earth again when is he coming back again the Bible says he will come with the ten thousands of his saints that is after the Rapture then we will be coming down with him he will be on a horse and we will also be on horses to the Earth again which type of art we are not coming back to an earth which is uh back Sweden Eden together we are not coming back to suddenly don't tell me that Jesus can be in control of governments with a lot of corruption yes with a lot of things our Jesus yes we cannot be controlling of governments who are killing others and now you are seeing what is happening in Russia I say you know going and it's bombing Ukraine last year Ukraine and Ukraine is a neighbor Ukrainian why is Russia bombing Ukraine actually because the government of Russia wants to take over the land of Ukraine the government [Music] and now you you're hearing you know when NATO went on to Libya and also they bombed Iraq at some point let me tell you the governments of this world government is insane apparently not the government of our God government is insane this is not the art we have always envisioned to live in and a CNC group when Jesus came on Earth yes they never met him one day Young only you can Bow Down foreign you will not see them again [Applause] each part [Applause] because the dream was from God and this people can you imagine and also God gave him the interpretations a representing the four kingdoms four great kingdoms and Empires that will rule this world and at that time said it was the time of the head the church that kingdom was the kingdom of nebuchadnezzarella at the head of God the Great Mighty Kingdom and yours is another was very happy you can even raise that statute it's all the people when you hear the sound of music listen the devil wants us to worship His music he wants us to dance to

[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] when the Angels wanted to come down foreign we are not only for the spirit and soul and truly me anymore amen he's keeping us alive hallelujah amen the devil doesn't know that one of these days [Applause] [Music] that image you had a statues there is and they start to remain as nothing the statue was reduced to soil nuts and then he said what's the meaning of this check the Bible in the Book of Revelation says the kingdoms of the world have become the kingdom of our God and of his Christ protestantism and religious you know denominations which was the meaning of the crane denominations foreign foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] all the kingdoms of the world now and what shall we be doing foreign [Applause] Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord willingly gave himself in order to bring us into a millennium I'd be able to rule with us and he will pretend this Earth I get you sensing done this Saturn is Aiden adjectives Hallelujah he

king of David he is a king and what about you you'll be in there with him what about the others but hey where will they be on the earth you will be in the city foreign I run to meet the heavenly father Guru praise the name of the Lord he kissed me on the neck she kissed away all my sins he put the Rope the Holy Spirit on me he put the wedding ring on my finger I'm going somewhere one of these days foreign I'm going somewhere one of these days put me Among Us these people here where we can rejoice and live together and be happy he has put me here with my brother [Music] why what I was dead like Jesus yes I was paying I removed and now I am alive I cannot say that I was I am alive now I will be the no I was dead now I am alive I was lost and now I am fine and there's many prodigals in the world today there is political men prodigal women and God calls for all to come to repentance he wants us to come he wants you to come I got an hour too all prodigals everywhere it says I am crucified with Christo nevertheless I leave yet not I think are you hearing that I live but Christ leave it and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of this I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain if what you do gives you the righteousness of God then Christ is dead in vain but listen it's not what you do that gives you righteousness it is he is giving himself God gives us righteousness do we understand that church Colossians 1 4 who gave himself for our sins that he might Deliver Us from his from this present evil world Acts chapter 20 verse 27 for I have not shown to declare unto you all the cancer of God take either affront yourselves and draw the flock over the wish the Holy Ghost has made you overseas to be the Church of God which he has purchased with his own blood foreign cubangas they foreign put that on the cross so who paid the price Jesus Christ yes Christ so who is the owner of the church okay so who purchased the church with his blood according to accident Ally who knows about the church if we say that is and the son died the son purchased the church and God is also claiming no they touch his mind you say the sun and the father are fighting for the church in heaven so the father and the son are very busy fighting the church is mine that is that's why the Trinity is a first Doctrine it's a Doctrine from hell to confuse the church there is one God of Israelites yes [Applause] all right yourselves it's talking to the preachers here to feed the Church of God that is come on the blood of Jesus the blood of God God even saying look at Jesus what do you see whatever yes you see a boy who was born in Bethlehem says God failed in this flesh I am Jesus Christ from the same people Jesus [Applause] [Applause] foreign that you know behold I'll send my message you he will suddenly come to history for the god to come in his Temple foreign and they say what are you talking about remember do you know that it took more than 40 years hallelujah amen the Bible says he was talking of his own body of Jesus what's the temple of God the word Son of God means temple of God is that a man second Corinthians 5 20. then we are ambassadors of Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ instead be reconciled to God for he has made himself to be seen for us who knew no sin that we might be be made a righteousness of God in him self [Music] foreign so you are the righteousness I am the righteousness praise the name of the Lord second Corinthians 5 18 it says and all things are of God who was reconciled as to himself by Jesus Christ and has given us and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation community listen our church to we that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their sin or trespasses unto them but has committed unto us a word of reconciliation um foreign [Music] [Music] what has he given to us the word of what how to add the sugar of reconciliation so now that Jesus has given his blood yesterday his blood has become the world in every generation he sends a portion of that revelation of the world that's a portion of his blood oh the prophet with a message is actually the blood for the people of that generation the revelation of that portion of the words oh my goodness the remaining portion of the blocks will you receive it foreign amen so Jesus was God yes nobody forced him to die and nobody could kill him do you think the Romans killed him then you don't know the Bible nobody could kill Jesus foreign no one nobody no one can kill God the Romans did not he let them yeah and I'll proved that to you when they were the Jews were taking him going to throw him on a cliff all right he looked at them they looked at him and he disappeared huh yeah that was the way it was supposed to Brethren be happy because you're not the son of perdition but you are chosen hallelujah amen to be the righteousness of God Judas was to be the righteousness of God John chapter 10 verse 17 communities but that's my father love me because I laid down my life that I might take it again [Music] um who gave out the light was it God who gave out Jesus that is why read the Bible Understanding when you read the John 3 for God fill up the world and die for my children yes that he loved you more than he loves confusion don't be in confusion foreign it was God himself why does my father love me so who is talking the sun is talking who is the Stars sometimes Jesus as the man could talk yes [Music] come foreign foreign oh goodness Verse 18 it says no man take a seat from me the righty no Roman can kill me anymore no Spirit can kill him anymore I myself I lay it down by myself Jesus where do you get that power yes hmm why didn't you say Jesus yeah to take it again this commandment I have received my father so which part are you talking about God the spirit Memorial you understand foreign and the Jews had a division he's mad more do you hear him these are not the words of him um but we know he's not God but we are confused but you know he's not The Devil Himself Jesus was not mad yes and he willingly laid down his life and he took it back again now we can stand and say I am he that was dead amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I said hallelujah hallelujah oh my can we give it one more time to the devil Hallelujah he could let down his life yeah but I'm away I'll take it back again why why because he was caught under body can lay down his life and take it back again I am the resurrection and the lies [Music] and that is why friends we baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if you are not baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because that's the right name Jesus was God yes Father Son Holy Spirit Lord Jesus Christ that's the name we will say Jesus is the name Jesus is the name Jesus is the name of the Lord Jesus is the name Jesus is the name yes we might identify the name come on oh we imagine imagine [Music] he submitted himself today yes but he laid down his life praise the name of the Lord and I want to read you a question about abandon who speaks of what the story is that message it says God knew God knew what he was doing when he looked through the blood of the innocent to the guilty that's bloody red and he sees him White interpreter let us take it line by line God knew what he was doing when he looked through the blood of the illness or to the guilty that's blood red this is I want two people to come here all right now let one stand right there um both of you say no no it's all right yeah both of you look this side look at me okay now here is Jesus oh no yes the Innocence and right there is he looks at the scene the the Innocence and he sees the sinner but he sees him as without kids for you to be the righteousness if Jesus is out of the picture yes you see and who is Jesus yes you will see your sins and everything I've ever done without him but when Christ comes in the beginning Christopher James and then he sees you through him yes [Music] amen what did Jesus do yes he gave himself not because you are righteous but because you have accepted the righteousness of God through Christ not because of something that you do situation not because of some good deeds you do the thing you do the Good Deeds because you are a Believer trousers because you're a Believers [Applause] your earrings because you're a Believers you no longer do the balance things and work as if they'll put something in your no you are not together so when somebody is trying to know Christ [Music] some of you approach it wrong way [Music] you approach it the wrong way you approach them the wrong way can you imagine see what you are doing no even you've got to come to our church why watch why what because when you have no Revelation yourself foreign but when they have never believed our brothers who have no Holy Spirit [Music] both of you have no Holy Spirit but if you had the Holy Spirit you would look beyond what you see one is do they have these things what makes them happy movies of the words what makes them happy songs so it's not the words that save you at all some good things that make you righteous you do the good things because you are a Believers that doesn't do sorry but that isn't what it does and that isn't what does it but that doesn't do it by Good Deeds joining church is all right and that isn't what does it that has it that isn't what does it it's when you recognize that you are a sinner you are lost the only way that God can see you righteous is through the blood of Jesus and when it sees you through the blood of Jesus is you as innocent as his own son that's the gospel story friends
