Come to your neighbor, tell them welcome to the house. I see many are not here this morning but we are happy that he has given us life us to be in the house of God and among those who are not here. I just have a testimony &gt;&gt; for one of the families. &gt;&gt; You know this morning somehow I just called uh brother Peter and he didn't pick up. Let let me tell you friend whenever your pastor called to pick up you do not know why he's calling. I also do not know why I was calling but I just called. and um he didn't pick up but then after about 30 minutes he called me back and um I was actually with brother when he called me and you know they they were packed up and ready to come to church and and um they they all was like going into the car. They put the children in you know, so he he he wanted to I think do something decided to step out and then um you know he also the sister you know sisters usually forget things. So she went to pick what she wanted leaving the children in. So one of the child disengaged the &gt;&gt; disengaged the uh underbreak &gt;&gt; and you know this is a huge gun and this I think is a slope I presume so because I'm I'm hearing where they live and so then off the car went with the children all the children inside and so you can imagine what can come out of such a huge catastrophe. So you couldn't talk. I called him. He couldn't talk. So the first thing I thought the children are gone. So I called him again. He couldn't talk. I was nervous. I called again. So the sister picked up the phone and um they told me, "Well, um the children all survived." And I think to me that's a huge testimony, before we talk about um before we begin passing judgments, let us thank God for what he has done. And uh I understand the car I mean like you know the car it's um almost the whole front is gone [Music] but the children the door was open survived with only a few scratches on all glasses shattering that can only be God. And so when you do not see somebody in church, don't judge. Pray. Amen. We I'm so happy with that testimony. Amen. We have brother Simon from Chhati who's also visiting with us this morning. I have you by the show of heart right over here. God bless you. Also yesterday we were in Mitana. And um we were at a wedding, a brother called Eager. I had to go. I those of you who know me, I rarely go to weddings and and so but this one I had to go. I just I remember there was a time when myself, brother Martin and brother we are all sharing one bed. Not because we wanted because we didn't have. And here is the part the bed was not ours. &gt;&gt; It was of a brother who was a teacher &gt;&gt; who was a teacher in a secondary school. A very nice brother called Grace and and so we were he was hosting us in his house so that we can be able to attend church. I mean like talk about talking about the love of the brethren. And so I mean I I remember those old memories. I was like no I have to go to this wedding. I was the youngest at the time. This I think brother was our senior right. So but it's not that he's the last two marries. I was like no. So sister ma I'm so sorry. I I I forgot about the appointment you know. We had an appointment to minister to his to her family. This wedding put everything out of my hand. So I'm really so sorry, sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so this morning we have a very very special people in our midst. Very special to me and my wife. And uh I hope they will be special to you as well. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um and I'd like to uh welcome them. &gt;&gt; One of them is not new to us. Sister um Emma Ephraim &gt;&gt; from Awasa. Some people don't know you. If you don't mind to start God bless you. God bless you so much. We are happy to be with you and the little one with you as well. but within Uganda. Uganda, &gt;&gt; we're just so happy to have you this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I heard from our husband told me that the family will be in Uganda. We are always happy to be with you. Amen. Um also this is the first time this sister comes here in the church. And uh we are going to have you speak. I hope you don't mind. Is that okay? Yeah. Yeah. It's okay. Should be okay. &gt;&gt; So her name is Sister Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; Sister Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; Uh would you mind coming? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's her first time in Uganda, her first time in the church here. And I'd like her to greet us. Can you get me get a another microphone? Any microphone. All right. Just greet us and tell us whatever you want to say. &gt;&gt; My name is Betty. I come from Ethiopia. &gt;&gt; And this is my daughter husband. It's my first time in this church. I'm happy to see you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, one thing before she goes back, &gt;&gt; you've heard me tell this the testimony over and over and over. This these people are sincere believers of the messenger. How many know brother Ephraim? Oh, how many don't know brother Ira? Okay, so there are some people don't know brother. Brother Ephra is is is the husband of sister Emma and he has preached for us here before and brother Ephraim is uh one of really I should say my lovely son and um he's the one that I said when I when I we saw him first with my wife he will believe the message and he will be a preacher of it. And it turned out to be true after a few years. She's now a pastor of the message. And um so this sister Betty did not immediately believe the message despite the fact that the brother had believed. He just didn't want to follow anybody. He wanted to know and be sure it is the one. And this is typical of many Ethiopian brethren. And I think this is wonderful where you don't just follow blindly where you just believe after seeing that it is the word of God and you know she she finally received the message gave up many things and sacrificed many things. Sister Betty. &gt;&gt; Sister Betty. &gt;&gt; Of course, at the time when you gave up things, you did not know what God will give you in life. But later on, of course, he gave you a wonderful husband. Uh, so she's married. Please, please. So God later on gave you a wonderful husband, brother. And you know who later on also believed and finally they got married, wonderful children. Tell us. We always talk about you. Some people here already know about your name and know your testimony. What moved you to believe the message? And I'm sorry I never told you I will ask you this question. It's a wonderful testimony for Okay, it's a sudden question. hadn't prepared but I used to know the message when my father was alive. I I have seen the picture of Branam on some books. Yes. And uh another brother from another country used to even preach in the house but we were not as big. So after a long period of time, my brother meet with the pastor tal. So he believed the message. He usually tell us to go to the church to read. So I I started coming on and off because I thought at first it was too serious. &gt;&gt; So I I go sometimes I get offended and I stay but deep down I know that's true. So even when I go to the other church I I try to dress modestly because because something tells me it's not my place. I have been a lot of many church but I know something is wrong with me. [Music] &gt;&gt; So when I come to this place I didn't like lift all my things like I didn't lift them suddenly but day by day just God took away some some things that I don't want in my life. May maybe some things I I was holding them like and God has put me in some like we call it desert and he has take taken all part of the things that he doesn't want from I'm still trying but he Yes. Now he has trained me through a lot. So I personally know him. So whatever is passing through your life, God is not letting you down. He's not He's not against you. But he puts you through some some life situation to get the best out of you. [Applause] Now I'm happy with my life. I am happy through whatever I went for for I know for sure God is like with me. Thank you Lord. [Music] The sister, sister Betty is one of the very first that believe the message in the country. My wife and I were there and uh I can say there's something about um about her family [Music] that uh their homes was one of the very first in the entire country of Ethiopia to hear of this message of God that before I my wife and I even traveled uh there's a brother who had already traveled there was working with the father of sister uh of sister Betty and you know after he died, you know, somehow the message had not yet become personally known to them as a family. But God is God. God is God. There is no seed of God can be lost. No seed of God can. It was proved to me. I knew of your father, sister Betty. I had tried to get to approach to get to see him because she was in translating the message, but somehow we were not allowed to meet him. And then after his passing, I did not know of any possible way of reaching out. But then God sent someone all the way from South Africa, a brother, pastor, preach of this message. contacts me and says there is a family that I have on my heart. I would like to come and look for them. When he mentioned the name of the man I knew, I said, "But there is no way I can possibly find them. Do you know of any way?" So I said, "Anyway, come we'll see what and talk about the leadership of the Holy Spirit. God led us from road to road, from block to block until we got to their house and the rest is history. This is not lifting any man, it is lifting God. So if God is not done with you, you cannot be destroyed. You cannot be lost. We appreciate God for this message. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Shall we stand on our feet as we are now going to go into the word just want to sing worthy is your name Jesus. Brother Shalom and then we'll read from the book of Colossians.

And if you open your heart, the Holy Spirit will will help me to continue and add on something. If you notice how much I preach determines depends on you and maybe my interpreter. So you pray for him that God will help him and also that pray for yourself that God will help all of us that we will be able to see what the Holy Spirit wants to see. Amen. Maybe brother Isaac you can call this part part three we're dealing on God having preeminence in his bride. Beware lest any man spool you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. And I think I'm going to read the rest alone, but you read that first part as well. All right. Now, I'll read up to verses 15. Just follow me. For in him dwelleth in dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily, and ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power, in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision, made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ, buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye arisen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead. And you being dead in your trust sins and and um and the and and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven all you uh forgiven you all your trespasses, blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to the to his cross. And having spilled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated, please. &gt;&gt; I think S you sang a very appropriate song and about him bridging the want to thank God for that. So, are you ready for the word this morning? That's 10% of you. &gt;&gt; Are you ready for the word this morning? Amen. And before I I we go into the word this morning, I wanted to remind you that I'll be away on Friday to see the Bible and I'll be away for um I had originally planned to be away for one weekend, but uh one of our friends there, pastor that I'm going to be around specifically requested that if I could be able to extend for another Sunday. So the Lord willing, we'll let you know. The Lord willing might be there for two Sundays and then we all right. So now we're speaking on very very important uh things on this subject and I'm really uh and sincerely asking for your undivided attention. Um, please let us try to avoid movements as much as we can. Let's get into this, shall we? This morning. Amen. God having preeminence in his bride. He wants to be seen. He wants to be worshiped. He wants to be known. This is not about a religion. This is not about a church. This is not about a preacher. This is not about a system. It's not about anybody. It's all about Christ. And that's why he said, "Beware lest any man spoil you, through philosophy, through vain deceit, through tradition of men and rudiments of the world, but not after Christ. And so we talked about philosophy, philosophy and we found out philosophy philosophy is a a set of beliefs or a certain thinking or ideas in in Latin it's called set of ideas. a set of beliefs. If you have ever heard of anything called a church manual, that is a set of beliefs and every denomination has a church manual. Of course, you know, we do not. And that's why we are not a denomination. Listen, we when I say we, I am not meaning this fellowship. Days of the voice fellowship days of the voice. &gt;&gt; We are only representative of the church of Christ. Christ has a church. It is one church. It is not divided and that church is all over the world. That's why it is actually supposed to be the Catholic church. The word Catholic means worldwide. The Roman Catholic Church claims to be the one world church of Christ but they are wrong. The bride of Christ all through the ages two Catholic church because it is worldwide. People almost everywhere whose hearts are all on fire. They are baptized in Jesus name. They are all believers of in other words is the church of Christ. But philosophy draw you away from the belief system of the world and it it will it will uh tie you to a belief system of a denominational church. Praise the Lord. Move my because I'm determined to pound this this morning. So they will tie you to a system. They will tie you to their denomination and when you leave it they will tell you you are lost. You see I and I pray that we as message believers never come to that place. Amen. Amen. Our churches are not churches are fellowships of one church and that church is all over the world. No one knows how many members are in it. So we don't know our membership but I can tell you they are all over the world but philosophy will simply take you to a set of doctrines and the bottom says well they say we believe A B C D F G Z full stop but he said that's a denomination but we are not a denomination. A B C D E F G and as much as God shall reveal. So we have no end to what our belief system is. As long as God has no end to him, we believe everything that he has revealed and everything he will reveal. Our revelation is not closed. Tell your neighbor our revelation is coming. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. And then he said be aware of philosophy. Be aware of vain deceit. You know tradition of men and we talked so much about tradition so I may not dwell on it so much this morning. many many traditions and you know it takes people away from the word we have even heard of many things. Oh, if so and if if a couple does this and this, they can't wear a gown. If they wear a gown on their wedding day, they can't cover their face, you know. I mean, these are just tradition. It's nowhere in the Bible. You can get married with or without a gown. Am I preaching to believers? You understand? But if you want to go, it's a honorable thing. It's a honorable thing. It's a tradition of the church. We are not bound to that or any other tradition. Pride is bound to the word. &gt;&gt; And you know, you have you have things I I've gave you a few a few examples. or someone immediately they they found they have done something wrong they have to come and confess before they come and everybody will ask him as if we are confessors we are not Catholic priests are you understand what I'm saying you know that's not how holiness or righteousness comes you know the holiness that Christ that is in Christ does not come by the works of the flesh. Let me put it this way does not come by your own human ability. And and so the that that kind of system those kind of tradition will not help but they will destroy and you have many traditions. Oh, if you leave this church I was in Nairobi and you know this was a message church. and we were having communion. And then this sister comes up. She can't have communion with us. And I asked her, "Sister, what's wrong?" She said, "Well, I'm from another church." I said, "Is it not a message?" She said, "Oh, yes it is, but it's not my local church. I cannot have I cannot have the Lord's supper in another home." That's a simple tradition. You don't find that in the world. And I'm afraid many believers who have subscribed to traditions instead of Christ. Let me say something this morning. The message actually came to set us free from traditions of men. The message came through. So this morning I can say I am liberator. This message come to cut our connection with men and us with Christ. We are in a uniting time. Is being united to the groom. all about you and Christ redemptive promise is your right is your right no man can take it no system how can they say when you leave our fellowship you are lost until they even say you can't marry from this church from the other church if you're not a member of this It's a tradition. If you want to marry in our church, come join our church. Sometimes even younger ladies get married. And they refuse to leave their churches simply because they feel heaven is here. I join the other church, I will go to hell. Why you get then marrying a brother from another church? God bless you. But I tell you, brother, you are free to marry anywhere as long as they are believers of the message of the hour. And if you love DVF so much and you don't want to leave, men don't and you you you you get married with from a a brother who lives in Ethiopia. &gt;&gt; I will tell you you are going to Ethiopia. &gt;&gt; By the way, we have a I'm sorry. I didn't even think about you when I said that. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a sister here, my daughter who went to That's the That's the way of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you get a sister, if you get a brother from another church, follow the brother. Unless of course you have a mutual agreement. We have we had one of my best singers here. She got married. And she left. I still feel bad. [Applause] But I blessed her. I said, "Go upon her husband. Praise the name of the Lord. That's the way of God. The way of the world this message, the reason why we have come men are not preaching Christ. They are preaching themselves. They are preaching their philosophy their own tradition. If you're preaching Christ, it doesn't matter where your people will go. We don't have a camp. We have no heaven to take it to you to be united with Christ. He wants to have the preeminence in his own body. He wants to have the control over his own people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. For Christ to have preeminence in his church is by the word. Two things by the word and the Holy Spirit. Amen. The word and the spirit are one. Amen. If someone claim to believe a word and then they reject the Holy Spirit, he sure they did not believe to begin with. But if someone claims to have the spirit, I will tell you what, they will always receive the word. So anything short of that it only creates philosophy traditions and these things listen are the breeding grounds to cults [Applause] tradition of man philosophy rudments of the world, the things that bring about cult. What is a cult? &gt;&gt; And I and I had a definition here that I got from, you know, uh from the dictionary. I'll read it to you again. Cult &gt;&gt; can refer to a group with an unusual often extreme religious, spiritual or philosophical belief system. often with a charismatic leader who exerts a certain significant control over the members. Alternatively, a cult can also it can also signify intense devotion to a person. [Music] all your devotion to that man to an idea or to a lifestyle. You see now you know these are the people who will be our man has spoken whe it is not true I don't care you accept it there is a problem their alleiance is with a man or a system and not the Of course, as I'm preaching, you are now wondering, am I in account? Of course, you have to check yourself. It doesn't matter what as long as they are gluing all their legions and you know to a man be aware. a man spoil you through philosophy and deceit tradition of men and rudess of the world [Music] after Christ. When you talk about their man, they can almost maybe kill you if they have diabist movement. They will follow the man as long as he has spoken, they will follow him. Where they speak lies, they will follow him. Whe they speak the truth, they will follow. I don't want to hear anything. But let me tell you, the message of Yahweh came to cut that nonsense. He came to cut that. Amen. He came to bring us to Christ. even say if it's not the word leave it alone if I say anything leave it alone that's what our prophet say is my and then you have people saying what brother said is my don't understand the message was a human being he was a man of God he was a prophet of God but even me as your not everything I say is the absolute I say you check it with a word Now our prophet told us whatever he says we check it with the world it believed this message for 19 years. I have some news for you churching the things with the Bible. I have always seen it is straight with the word straight with the word straight with the word and that's why I'm following brother I'm not following brother I'm following him because he's following Christ and when I say him I'm not meaning a man the man died more than 50 years ago I am his message, his teaching teaching. [Applause] So where is my allegiance? I pledge alce to the lamb. He alone was worthy to take the book and reveal the mystery to us. Amen. Apostle Paul said follow me as I follow Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Brother, come up here. This is the problem we have in our generation. Come up here. And so when your leader is following Christ, follow him. But the problem, even when he veers off, we veer off. That's the problem. We should never leave the word. God is not a respector of God. God respects one thing that is his word. And as long as a man is respecting the word, follow the man. &gt;&gt; It's all about Christ. Praise the Lord. Friends, it's only in the message church we can preach this. If you preach this in some denomination, they will think you attacking their mind. But I'm so glad in this message we have no big somebody. We have no small. We only have one big Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. We have one big word, the Holy Ghost. And that's what we are following. Oh, I am so glad to announce this morning we are not but be aware. There will be men who will try to drive you following a man of following Christ. &gt;&gt; You know in the days of brother Bam There are people who came up and they said go it has been revealed to us no one should preach but you you were Jesus Christ he said what that's blasphemy I am your brother we have preachers everybody should preach everybody that is called to preach should preach that's what our prophet said even today you have some believers who will tell you that still only brother Bam should preach tradition of men philosophy and you know it's a certain spirit because it comes using the word but you have to have a spirit of desire to know like Paul said, some say we have aos. Did I die for you? Were you baptized in my name? Did I give my blood for you? But friends, we have someone who gave his blood for us. Who died for us? &gt;&gt; The one that was worthy. And that is Jesus Christ. And brother said the message is Christ. Now we have no headquarter and we should not have a headquarter because we do not have to pay allegiance to any man. The highest authority in the church is the pastor. But what does the pastor use? He uses the word and the Holy Spirit. Did you know in this generation we have men who will tell you they go cry? My husband my husband your husband. God already spoke to me. Leave that man. He's stabbing you. I'll give you brother Julius because he knows brother Julius &gt;&gt; is a die hard. He knows he's an follower. He would die for his leader. the same brother and they have many who are caught into those kind of they don't even check anything with the word but a prophet taught us always check it with the word give everything a word test if you pass the test of the word then believe it. &gt;&gt; If it doesn't, regardless of who has spoken it, walk away from me. All right. Now, I'm going to do a lot of quoting and brother, if you can put up the voice. So, while I'm quoting, I'm preaching. Don't wait for me to quote and then preach. I preach quote. Ephesian church agent says in other words take all the sacredness and all the power from the church and put it on the priests. Let the congregation live the way it wants to, but the priest is the holy one. Taking the Holy Ghost away from the people with signs and wonders following them and take that away and give them a holy power. Are you not so glad that you are believing a message that still believes in signs and wonders in the supernatural? &gt;&gt; Amen. Every denomination is led by elders. And I I gave you example the Roman Catholic Church. That's what they call a Roman curer. Curia is a is a it's a it's um a council of of of uh how do they call them? Cardinals inside the big things. And when you go to the Anglican church, when you you have to go to Baptist, they sit down and they are the ones who make the big decisions. So they're the ones when someone goes rogue or direct them. But you see that is not the order of God. God has his own way of ruling over his own church. Am I preaching to someone this morning? What does God use? God uses the Holy Spirit and the word. And here is the most interesting. Every member of the body has access to those two. That should make you excited. You have access to the word. You have access to the Holy Spirit. You can deep in by yourself. So what then do pastors do the the teacher the the apostle ministry? Their job is not to introduce something new. Their job is not to give you their opinion. Their job is to edify you so that you can mature. And how do they do that? Preaching and teaching. But they also do it power of the Holy Spirit. You realize a man without the Holy Ghost preaching this gospel take many people to hell. You don't only need a gift. Gift is one thing. And the Bible says gifts and callings are without repentance. But you need Holy Ghost filled men who will take the word. the Holy Ghost and they preach this message and they preach the word and can I inform you we have these ones very many around the world. Amen. We have so many you can't finish them. Even right here in the church we have so many. I am just one little bit of but God will use them and then also he will use the nine spiritual gifts. Praise the name of the Lord. And that's the order of God. But this system they will take all those things and throw it out of the window. They are allergic to tongues. They are allergic to speaking in tongues and interpretation of afford in so many me churches brother. Do you know they speak about tongues in a negative way? Do you know why? Because they don't see them operating in their midst. They think it is Pentecost. It is not Pentecostal. It is open. Open your Bible. Open your Bible. Mark chapter 16. I want you to read vers 16. Not my Bible. In your Bible. Can we give you a microphone? You read it. Let's try to be fast. Brother Calb, quickly. Where's the microphone? Somebody come up. Stand up if you have you have seen it. &gt;&gt; No good Bible reader here. All right, read it quickly. And he said unto them, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel creature. He that believeth and baptized shall be saved. But he that believeth not shall be done. And these signs shall follow them that in my name they shall cast out. They will speak with new tongues. Read that again. In my name they shall cast out devils. &gt;&gt; They shall do what? &gt;&gt; Cast out devils. &gt;&gt; Everybody say they shall do what? Do we still believe that? They're casting out devils. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And they shall speak with new tong. &gt;&gt; They shall speak with new tongues. Did you hear that? &gt;&gt; Someone said, "Oh, those new tongues have to be only languages of men." No. No. The Apostle Paul taught it can be tongue of angels or Yes sir. Yes. Yes. But as long as this coming from all by inspiration of the word. Can someone speak tong and interpret on their own? Yes. But then it has to be judged by those who are spiritual. You know these things are told well in the message but we just dismiss them and we go back to our foundations again. Because you see if we let anybody remove that from us what are we remaining with we are going to remain with philosophies. We are going to remain with tradition and Christ will not have his church like that come out of them. He wants to lead his church. He wants to be the one to instruct. It finally became in this church here. It was deeds and this place became a doctrine in the age of it took over and when Luther came out he couldn't stay that way. It went right back again and took over again. bishops, cardinal who in the world is the head of the church of God's church but he himself the Holy Ghost was sent to rule the church every believer not just the preacher the whole congregation the preacher is holy but all the congregation all the church must must have the Holy Ghost. So we are all holy. That's why he says to the saints at that's why I said God bless you saints. So you have been made holy and we have already been dealing with that our identity is not in our mistakes. Listen, for you not to accept what he has made you is to be proud. So he said you are holy. Do you believe it? You are holy. You are without blemish. No spot. No wrinkle washed in the blood. And then he says glorious child. That's what he sees when he [Applause] hallelujah. Do I have mistakes? &gt;&gt; A whole lot of them. Have I done wrong things? A whole lot of them. But it doesn't look at those. He said, "As long as you have confessed and repented of them, the bleach of the blood of them." &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he bridges the curs on the other side. What is on the other side? The mystery becomes unveiled. What is the mystery? Follow me church. This mystery is a mystery which has been hid in all age generation. He says but now it has been made manifest to his saints. He says what is the mystery? It is Christ in you. the hope of glory. So that's why Paul said if there is any glory it is in Christ I have nothing to glory in my glory in Christ and in the work of redemption but he has done for me. So what is it? He is the preeminent one. I'm so afraid that the church has wanted to take that glory or a few members of it called bishops, apostles, pastors or some gifted people and you'll find that they will become something what God intended. Let's continue studying. Um and we are in the church Ephesian church now. Please just stay with me now. We only have one Sunday morning. It's it's 12:12. Give me some time. If you love the word, you won't be bored. You won't even be tired. You won't even do. Praise the Lord. Listen now. What was the spiritual climate of that church? It had left its first love, leaving his first love of the word of God was revealed to us as having fallen from its origin. Remember, we talking about our true origin. The church is fallen. because they have left of the blood again to where we came from. We come from God. We go back. That's why the origin was because the outpouring of the Holy Ghost In a plain English that means this church was in danger of be being taken away from the leading of the being taken away from the control of the spirit. This was exactly what took place after Moses led Israel out of Egypt. The way of God was to lead them by the cloud of fire by prophetic utterance by miracles and signs God given wonders. This is the way of God. He wants to lead us. Sisters, brothers, can we allow him to lead us? We believe is the same today. Miracles still happen. Wonder still happen. Sign still happen. Prophetic. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Can you imagine? People despise these things and they call it Pentecost. No, it is ours. This was to be accomplished. Oh, listen now. How was God going to lead the church using those things? Prophetic utterance, signs and wonders and and all these things. How was he going to do that? He says this was to be accomplished by God selected. by God selected. He has more. All right. You want me to finish it? God selected, God ordained, and God equipped. And God sent men, God ordained. Do you believe that? That Oh my. May God open this to you now. Do you believe God can call and select a man, ordain the man, equip the man, and send the man out. How many believe that? Well, we believe it. But today, that has been replaced. You go to theology seminary. &gt;&gt; You stud degree or or some doctorate, PhD, whatever it is. And then you have those titles by your name, bishop, doctor, PhD, then the world can open their eyes. But who sent him? Philosophy. Philosophy. said, "Brethren, when I came among you, I did not come with excellency of spirit. I did not come with man's wisdom. The things I know, I did not learn it from the wisdom of man." It was revealed to me. Oh, may God send us more preacher. Those are the ones we want because then we know we shall hear from God. And then he says the whole church also will be dominated by the Holy Ghost move. But you see they rebelled and they wanted a set of rules and creeds to Brother said when they denominate they die. You know they come to say well we are not so many let us make rules. Some people want to run church as an NGO. Others want to run church as a company. Others want to run church. as their backyard business. Friends, we have to understand God is God and God does his business the way he wants to do it. Whether you agree with him or not, he will run. Amen. The church came together selected a man called Mafia. Many of you even don't know. He never accomplish anything. But God is good. He goes behind them and he looks for a man who was persecuting the church. A bad man, a bad boy, a gangster. And he tells him to feel I have selected you. When God selects you does not matter. Someone did not hear me. Hallelujah. and he selected him and he said I don't care what they think about you what you have done I have selected you are going to you are going to go bless to the preach I am the truth I am the way I am the Can you imagine God selected him? Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. And he sent him out. He was equipped by the power of the Holy Ghost. He said everything I knew might so that I may win the excellency. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Can I say this? Christ. We are selected. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Many are called chosen. We are the chosen people in this generation. We are the overcome to over. Hallelujah. In every age there were those overcame every age. Don't cry because there's a spirit training you doesn't matter. I must overcome. I must overcome. I must overcome. Don't just look at me. Preach with me this morning. I must overcome. Amen. You believe that you wrestle with it and you will prevail. Let me tell you, we have a prophecy. And the prophecy says, let me tell you what he say. He says, Amen. All hell, all hell shall not prevail. Shall not prevail. over you. Why? Why? Because you are God. You are God. You are God. You are equipped. Listen. Think about those words. Think about the words. You know what it means? &gt;&gt; Listen to them again. You are God selected. Think about it. You are God. You are God. You know what it means? It means you cannot fail. Now tell me how can God select you? No. No. Think about it. How can God select you today when he knows he will lose you tomorrow? [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory [Applause] me. Amen. I shall prevail. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Who am I? I am chosen by God. I am known before the foundation of the world. I was ninjal to overcome all the demon. Hallelujah. [Applause] That is why he gives us of the spirit. He knew we cannot overcome being a human. &gt;&gt; So what did he do? Oh my, I feel twice my size right now. What did he do? He decided to overcome as a human being. So that we will not have to overcome a human being. Stop looking at your humanity. Look at your divinity. Because he has obtained you [Applause] Christ. Christ in you. the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Wait, sit down. Listen to this. &gt;&gt; Listen. The Bible says, "All have sinned and have come short of the glory of God." So, we all came short. All I've seen and I've come short of the glory. But then he says, hey, here is a mystery. It has been hid from ages and generation but now it has been made manifest to every Tom Deacon Harry to his which is Christ in me. And then he say the hallelujah. So when he says all have seen and come short of the glory I am not one of them. Hallelujah. Do you get it? I am not. If you have not understood it, you are remaining jump. Put on your spiritual thinking. I am not one of them. We all have seen and have come short of the glory. Well, I used to be. I am no longer one of them. Why? I am on the other side. I have been liberated. I have been redeemed. To the glory. So where am I? I am walking in power. I am walking in. I am walking in the word of the Lord. That's the bright place. I'll give you some more. You know, he says that you know you have already passed from death into life. So where are you? You are where are you? You are in the life. Hallelujah. Stop yourself. Hallelujah. Where are we now? We are in heavenly place in Christ Jesus. So I I'm going to refuse to believe I am not a loser. I am not a sinner. I am not [Applause] a son of God. Hallelujah. I am rich. Not just in money. Amen. Not just in money. I am rich. Glory. His power in his grace. Hallelujah. Christ is being the preeminent one. Come on, give him a clap of praise. But you see these men, &gt;&gt; they try to remove that power from us &gt;&gt; and try to show you as one little sorry human being who is at the mercies of a certain so-called bishop, man of God, apostle, prophet, teacher, pastor, church, denomination, great organization. If you leave our church I'm Christ. You're gone. &gt;&gt; Gone where? &gt;&gt; Yes, of course I'm gone in Christ. &gt;&gt; You need to understand when I say these things. It's also bringing me in problem because I'm a pastor with the church. You understand? But I'm not trying to point you to the church. No, I'm pointing you to Christ. &gt;&gt; Sing a song. He said, "If you kill my body, my spirit, but my spirit is in Christ." That's where the bride is in. This message has come to separate us from the dogmas of men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you you say but these people they not wanted they rebelled they wanted rules and greeds. Oh my so many rules. Let me tell you, I used to. I'll be honest with you. I used to, but I no longer see this message as rules. That's true. It used to be I couldn't even baptize somebody with a bracelet on their hand. Think about it. It was a revelation I had. You understand? I have to tell them. Remove your trousers because it worked, but in the realms of legalism. [Music] So, I don't know. I'm not too sure how many genuine ones I had. But I can tell you I heard but I'm not sure whether they were all genuine. Are you genuine? &gt;&gt; You can only be genuine when you are set free from the rules and then Christ in you does the good work without the rules. He that is in Christ has gone beyond the law. You not kick away the law is beyond the law. The law doesn't control you. How many understand this? It is all about Christ. It's not about rules. Ah, &gt;&gt; it's not about rules. When a child is young, you raise them with rules. Like most of my children are now going by rules. It is a must for you as a parent to raise your children with rules. They are young. They're taking milk. They don't know what is good and wrong. wrong. So they need to be told you see but not forever when they you know maybe make 17 or 18 then you realize if your rules have not worked on them to see the right thing at that time it cannot after 18 quit because by that time to be mature enough to understand the what will please the father. If your children love you, they want to please you. Are you following me? They want to please you, but they don't know what to do to please you. When they are so young, so you need to tell them, "I don't want you to dress that. I don't want you to speak like that. I don't want you know sometimes when we are married we tell our children shut up and then you hear them telling each other shut up. You're like, "Oh, okay. I'll wash my tongue also." Cuz you need to tell them. You don't talk that way. Be kind. Don't tell your siblings, "Shut up. Shut up." But training is a process. But you need to really seriously train because you only have a short time. After that time, Then they are on their own. They will realize what is good, accept and pleasing to the father [Music] because they have grown. So they expected to know they expected to do. So when you see them doing something wrong, you may not even speak as much. We just wink at them and oh that happened change. That's the same thing with God. You know, we don't have to keep feeding on milk. There's a time when you came to Christ, you had to be told how to make your hair, how what to put on your skin, what not to put. You understand, what to dress, how not to dress and I'm afraid we want to teach these things for 40 years. The church needs to grow. When I say the church, I mean you as [Music] You cannot be in the message for 20 years for 5 years being told how to dress, how to make your hair, how to there's a problem with go and make inventory. Am I following rules or am I am I genuine? Do I have the Holy Ghost? Am I converted? Is there something wrong? Am I just following? Have I found Christ? Let me tell you, when you find Christ, oh, the Lord sees, you don't need them anymore because you want to do that which is good and acceptable to God. [Applause] You want to do that which is pleasing to the Father. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How can you know what is pleasing? By reading the word. By listening to the message. If when you believe, you don't read the message. You don't read the Bible. You will never know what is pleasing. You need to keep coming so we can tell you the Lord. But when you mature, we no longer talk about the rules. We have to get into the deep stuff. &gt;&gt; The deep the bone marrow. Pull it out. How many have you ever eaten bone marrow? Some of you don't know about maybe you are so rich and when you are eating meat just throw the body. But some of us the best part of the meat is the bone marrow after eating the meat then you take the bone begin to ah nothing like the bone marrow and I tell you friends we need to do that with the word you see we need to get into the deep stuff pull it out of the And when you do that, when you come to church, you will enjoy them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to be longer than usual today. Give me 30 minutes. And then I'll be quit. Now let let us follow on closely. He said, see how it started out in the early church. It was called deeds. Then it became a doctrine. It became the standard. It became the the unbending way. It finally took over and God was pushed aside. Oh, it sounded so small, so quietly, so in offensive even right now. Let me warn you. You know me, I encourage you here every day to go and listen to the message. But I want to know how many are listening to the message now. No, wait, wait, wait. Be sincere now. How many are listening to the message in their homes or privately on their phones or whatever? How many have started either listening or reading? Lift up your hand up high. Others are being like this. I want to see your hand. Okay. God bless you. Still it's a small number. There is a big number that is not listening. And that's a bad thing. But I want to encourage you. Stop pushing it ahead. Begin today. Begin today. It's a challenge I'm giving you. I encourage you to listen to the message. But I want I want to warn you of a certain spirit that is creeping in. [Music] Um I don't know if I'll find it on my phone. I saw a certain picture that was posted and um I know these things somehow you come across them and it's good as your pastor for me to address them from the front and this was a question from one of the preachers and when you listen to it I want you to think for a moment. He said this. Do you believe what the prophet said on the tape is your absolute or do you believe it is the Holy Spirit through you or your pastor? Are you thinking? You want me to read it again? Do you believe what the prophet said on the tape is your answer or do you believe it is the Holy Spirit through you or your pastor? Why? Why this question? For what purpose? What is the intention? You know, I I realize we just post everything. We see everything and post everything. Everything we post. So what is this trying to achieve? It's trying to shake you up and tell you you do not need you what you have to say. You do not need your pastor what he has to say. All you need is what the prophet had to say. Because the prophet is words. But not only is this wrong, it removes this principle of the preeminence. of God in his body. [Music] And listen to me carefully here because we understand according to Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever, right? Brother Banham said, "I preach what?" &gt;&gt; Say it louder. &gt;&gt; I preach what Paul did. He read only the letters and say, "Amen." And he read what Paul read and the Holy Spirit would come upon him. and he would expound it for the [Music] all the teachings we teach in the message are not new is the same old teachings that Paul preached what did he preach one God it's in the Bible baptism in Jesus name in the Bible no women preach Tongs must be interpreted. Women shouldn't cut their head. I don't even need to quote one to any of those to teach any of those things. It's right here. Tell me what I'm told. It's already in here. He didn't bring a new teacher. You already saw it. He came to finish this. So now that's why he say that the Bible is his absolute. The Bible is our absolute. Now brother is not our prophet. He died long ago. &gt;&gt; Follow me closely here. I don't want you to miss anything here. &gt;&gt; But he as a prophet of the age, his interpretation of the Bible is the absolute interpretation. And I'll explain. There have been many today that explain the Bible. God has a way of expounding the scriptures. Are you following now? Amos 3:7. God will surely do nothing. He will reveal his secrets. his servers. Revelation 10:3 say, "But in the days of the fourth seventh when he begins to the mystery will be finished or is finished." So now it the seventh angel has to come a prophet of God and then he would open. Now let me put it this way. He would reveal the mystery. Are you following? Remember the book was already he revealed their what did he reveal? He revealed what was already there. So what was the problem? The problem was not this. The problem was this. Our eyes of understanding. But now after he has come, we can say our eyes of understanding the Lord has opened. So by hearing the message of the hour, our eyes open to the now we can understand this mystery. So you cannot remove the prophet of the age. He is the one to whom revelation comes. But remember after revelation has come to him, it's not all about him. Are you following church? He is not the groom. Who is more important? Right. Are you following? Who was more important? Please follow me closing here. Very sensitive subject. Was it [Music] already? Why chapter 4 said, "Behold, I send you." Can you imagine someone said behold I send the prophet because they don't have the revelation the scripture says I send you. So who is being sent? Jesus. Your servant, your messenger, who is more important, the one receiving the message. Why? Because the preeminence of the one sending the message must stand within the one who has received the message. The messenger is a mighty man because God has used him was a mighty man. We don't read about him anymore because he finishes the story of and Isaac begin. Where is the church now? The church is within the story of Rebecca and [Music] [Applause] follow the Who is the bride? The bride is the bride of the bridegroom and the bridegroom wants to have preeminence in the bride. Imagine after Isaac and Rebecca saw each other, &gt;&gt; the importance of diminish what? Not even not even told Rebecca there. He's the one the one with the heart on the moment they saw each other. You know love is strong is very strong. Love is strong. &gt;&gt; Didn't look at this. I didn't look at this. Look somewhere. And then she also looked. If you notice, not everybody here is smiling. There is one person smiling. because we know each other. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's how it was. &gt;&gt; Then she ran to him. He received her and the love story began. Now after Revelation 10:7, it begins. Take the book out of the angel. Eat it. said, "I took the book and I ate it. It became in my mouth sweet as honey and then he said, "Thou shall prophesy again." That's the place where we are now. Hallelujah. Is prophesying again. saying what the prophet said message. Hallelujah. What is the message? Hallelujah. Not a church system. A man, a man or something like that. The message is not William. We are noting people and we areing them to cry and why is the church built and that's where we are built. I am I am built on who Jesus Christ when I know who Jesus Christ I know who I am. I know who I am. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know that old song was holy all hail me. You know it's a very old song. Hallelujah. You cannot defeat the church of God. That's who we are. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. I have five minutes I see. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I I I try to bring these things and finish it in a go. But are you enjoying this church? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so they came out and they you know friends to close what I started. I said what is more important is that Christ will be seen. [Music] We are not here to introduce a man to people. We are here to introduce Christ. The one that can change our life. &gt;&gt; The one that died for us. &gt;&gt; The one that has made a difference. Amen. Amen. You know, in the last five years or so, whenever the Holy Spirit tells me stop, cuz I realized if I don't, then I am out of his will. So, I just stop here. Let us stand on our feet. Amen. Amen. I just wish that uh we can get deeper into this. Thank you for being so listening. And as you close your eyes, as musicians come, could you please think about what you have heard? Think about yourself. Is Christ being the preeminent one in your life? We need to come to that place. [Music] where it's not about you. It's about him because he's the one that made a way where there was no way. Many times our back hits the wall and we do not know what to do next. Sometimes don't even know what and who to trust. But I want to encourage you, friend. We have someone we can trust. &gt;&gt; Someone that died for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And his name is Jesus Christ. And he's here this morning to make a way for you. Remember, he wants to be seen. He wants to be magnified. He wants to be glorified. Would you say, "Lord, come and make a way in me. Make a way for me. &gt;&gt; What if brother Shalom can come and help me sing? This is a moment where you talk to him silently. [Music] You [Music] made you take away with our backs against the [Music] You made it our way. [Music] And we are standing here only because you [Music] [Applause] listen church. If you can close your eyes about what we are singing now, I'll tell you why we sing this song. John cried and he wept. said, "Who is worthy?" And John found there was no one. No one was worthy. That means you &gt;&gt; and I would be lost forever with no redeemer. But Jesus, Jesus Christ made a way. And we are standing here today being called a bride only because of him. &gt;&gt; He moved mountains for us. He makes words to fall by his power. He performs miracles. Even today the work of redemption was like a miracle. Even he does many many in need of a miracle. Do not look at man. Look at him. The one that died and gave his life. Let it be the preeminent one in. Let us sing it. Brother Shalom. You made a way. Oh, just lift up your hands if you can sing. Sing it together now.

[Music] [Music] Listen friends, sing it slowly, brother. &gt;&gt; We're not here to just have a religious meeting. The King of Kings, the Lord of Lords is here in our ministry. That does not call for shouting and noise. It calls for sincerity. He calls for you to just be sincere before him and say, "Lord, I I I lay I lay my crown down for you. I lay my life down for you. I lay everything down for you. All my prestige. All my plans and my future, everything, I lay down for you. so that you may be saved. &gt;&gt; He wants to be seen in your life. &gt;&gt; He will heal you. &gt;&gt; He will do a miracle for you just now if you worship him in spirit and in truth. For he said the father loves such to worship him. that will worship him in spirit and in you think about it. Nothing else you could do. But only the lamb. Only the lamb is worthy. If you have energy to lift up your hand, close your eyes. Let us echo that chorus one more time.

As we begin this week, Lord, [Music] I ask the Lord, the spirit of God will be with each and every one of us lead and guide us through this life's journey. Lord, we would like to appreciate you &gt;&gt; also for the families visiting us &gt;&gt; today from Ethiopia. &gt;&gt; We bless them Lord. We bless them Lord for standing for you and you through it all. No matter what the devil's thrown at them in many ways, they have stood for you. We thank you Lord for the family of our brother Ephra, his wife sister Emma. Lord, the family bless them. I pray make yourself be the one to be the preeminent one [Music] in their life and in their ministry. Brother Salama and his wife here with us, Sister Petty, Lord, do the same for them, Father. Lord, even speaking to brother Salam a few days ago and knowing that he seeks your will and many things in his life, leadership and direction. I pray that you'll be seen. You'll be the preeminent one. Lord, we pray for everyone that has come today. May you be sin. May you be the preeminent. [Music] Let it be your prayer friends before you cry. Well, lift your hands to him. Tell him in your heart, Lord. Be seen in my life. Be the preeminent one. think is a good day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Grant it father in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless your saints. You may just want to dismiss you. Turn to your neighbor, tell them thank you for coming to the house of God. It seems the service is just starting. Amen. God bless you. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Isn't it lovely to be in his presence? Amen. Amen. Give me some background musicians, please. I just wanted to uh make a few remarks. &gt;&gt; Brother Joel, can we have can I have the report for this week, please? [Music] as that is coming. &gt;&gt; I wanted to let you know that we were at PDN uh this past week [Music] I don't remember how many of us went but I think brother [Music] and uh and who else? Who else went with us? These ones are the ones that usually work on the budget [Music] for the youth meetings. [Music] &gt;&gt; So uh we have got already a bill build to us um an invoice &gt;&gt; but I think PDN will be much cheaper for us. uh than what we spent last year, much lesser. &gt;&gt; So the hall is smaller than Chamogo University. But uh overall when you rate them on like most of the other amenities that we want, [Music] they are much better because um we we have a hall with all the equipment the the the sound but we take our our instruments And um then um so we get to spend on a few uh but they just give us a oneoff for the hall [Music] and then they um also remember the our friends in Nairobi they've always been finding a hotel renting outside. Uh, brother Joseph, I don't know where you are going to get this information. So, but these people have um an entire building furnished, &gt;&gt; beautiful uh beds and everything that the brethren in Kenya or here you have money and you want to pay so you can sleep comfortably. [Music] there those uh um that accommodation is there &gt;&gt; uh each room I think goes for about 130 a night yeah for two nights many of you can afford really especially those of you with families if you want to be with your wife and children it would be advisable come and let us know &gt;&gt; so that we can be able to um to book a room for you. &gt;&gt; So we we see that all the Kenyans will sleep there. Those that will be able to come usually have 30 representatives or more. I don't know how many will come this time. Then also um we have they have also more rooms they constructed. I think they also have other cheaper ones. The ones who don't want luxury, who just need a bed, &gt;&gt; they can als you can also find they are very limited. So you need to inform us ahead of time for booking. You cannot come in the week of the meetings and say I want a room. the other people will use the holes like we did last time. So if you want to sleep comfortably in a family group or something like that, let us know so that we can make that means you must be able to pay separately. Separately listen separately from the camp fee. You understand that? &gt;&gt; So, but um the rest of the people when they pay fee, of course, we'll get them those holes where they can sleep. So, um and also we we have areas where we can make our guests sleep. So, it's a good place overall when you consider all those things. Last year, we missed it because we were late. Someone else booked it. So we are not going to miss it this time. I told you we already have two confirmed guests from Australia Australia going to come and be our speakers and then we also expect um another one. I'll let you know. I just still working on that. That's why we have delayed to send out our announcements. But also this land fund, it's been our priority. [Music] So we wanted to first get it out of the way. Amen. So we will I think in the following weeks we will let you know the budget. Um the brother I think he's still working on it. Now um I want to first of all appreciate &gt;&gt; the givers, the ones who are consistent. May God bless you so much. [Applause] Amen. Um, Martin Luther gave 729 [Music] and that is because we had a brother, a friend of ours uh from from Kenya &gt;&gt; who gave 510 52 something. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and contributed towards our land fund. And this is not his first time. People love DVF &gt;&gt; and much of these funds we've not raised alone because much of this congregation is young people really, a few employed and uh so it is the grace of God and it will be the grace of God all through and It is by faith. Let me tell you without faith you cannot do such things like a church four years old 80% young people raising 99 million in four years. Isn't that a miracle? It's a miracle. It's a miracle. Not because we have a lot, but because God is helping us. Is that a man? So as a as for as a our target the brother already announced we need 166,000 [Music] to fill up um uh the 100 million. I need that now so that you leave when you know on Wednesday we are making that transaction. [Music] Yeah. [Music] I I don't need two or three. I need one person. One person. No, not like that. What I'm saying, I need one brother or one sister. From a manga. I don't know whether we are streaming. This should not be from this should be from among us. [Music] 60,000. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you so much. [Music] family. May God bless you. May God bless you. We're going to pray blessing for you. This money we are giving for buying land. This is how we sow our seeds. Others you don't even have a box to break. This is your now you are saving because whatever you pay to the work of God. You are lending he must pay you back. You have swn in God's work. He has to return. Do we believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you so much sister. So I want to announce brother where the treasurers please stand up quickly. [Music] Those are the treasurers. You meet them. We need that money either today or tomorrow &gt;&gt; so that we round off the 100 million shillings. Then &gt;&gt; there is another money which we used in the youth camp. &gt;&gt; It is too much. It is more than 30 million. &gt;&gt; Some of the money we have paid. [Music] There is still another lumpsum which is remaining. But I want to appreciate sister Esther. Sister Esther [Music] Sister to talk about it. &gt;&gt; But Sister Esther, she's one of the brethren in the church said, "Pastor, I'm going to help you carry." And she gave money that is not small. I want us to clap for her. Sister God bless you, Sister Esther. &gt;&gt; And Amen. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Sister Mary, she's not around. She gave me an amount and said, "This is the match. I believe I will support on that." &gt;&gt; There was another brother Ken. He gave an million and 50,000 to help on the 30 million. There was still some big money remaining. I don't want to tell it to you to discourage you or to make you starting [Music] But we are failing. We have failed. If you want to know the total ask with an intention of giving something, come and meet me, pastor, how much barre meet the treasurers. You ask them, they'll tell you. Then you make a pledge on what you want to this Wednesday. God gives us the grace and love all the money to pay 100 million Uganda money [Applause] [Music] and there will be a balance of 120 millions Uganda money. &gt;&gt; I'm requesting you for two things. So &gt;&gt; the first thing &gt;&gt; let us double our weekly contributions. [Music] We are more than able to buy this land but with unity there is no money that is too small. [Music] whatever you have. I've heard people saying, "Oh, they say, "Brother Brian, $5,000, but then you give nothing." It is also equally ashamed. If it is 5,000, you can in that week, give it. If it is 2,000, brother, count for me. If someone gives 2,000 share every week, how much is that in a month? Quick math. 8,000. How much is that in a year? [Music] 720 [Music] Brother, are you right? Are you sure? &gt;&gt; Let me count again. Someone has given 2,000 in four weeks. That's one month. 8,000 &gt;&gt; in 12 months. &gt;&gt; 96,000,000. &gt;&gt; Okay, brother. [Music] Okay. [Music] There is an example I want to give you. How old are you, brother? Come. There's something I'm trying to impress on you. Come, come here, brother. [Music] Okay. Okay. Which class are you in? He's also in P7. Oh, so all the students we have here in P7. Okay, no problem. Let me use him as an example. Um, if you is it possible for you to work while you're going at school to find something to do maybe for mommy in her project or daddy or somewhere or the village or whatever and make some money? Is it possible? &gt;&gt; Okay. How much can you make in a week, in a day or in a week? [Music] You can make in in one week. &gt;&gt; Being a generous man that you are, &gt;&gt; how much can you give towards the church? [Music] Now brother, let us count for you. In a week 4,500 in a week times 4 you would have given 18,000 shillings in one in one month time 12. Do you see how much you would have given in one year? Have you ever given towards the land fund? &gt;&gt; Yes. You've not yet given anything? You have not yet had &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, okay. Am I speaking like a French man? Have you ever given anything towards the land fund?
