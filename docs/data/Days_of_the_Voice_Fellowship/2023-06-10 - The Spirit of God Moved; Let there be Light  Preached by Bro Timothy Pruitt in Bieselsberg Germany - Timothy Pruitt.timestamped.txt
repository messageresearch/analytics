[9:03] opportunity
[9:06] as he said I came here almost 30 years
[9:09] ago yes
[9:13] I remember that trip quite well
[9:17] that actually went to Africa for a few
[9:19] weeks and then came here

[9:26] forever
[9:29] I was about 18 years old
[9:33] you know as a teenager you think you got
[9:36] it all figured out as teenagers
[9:39] but I realized I didn't have anything
[9:41] figured out
[9:44] but God rich in Mercy on our lives
[9:49] but he watched over us and brought us
[9:52] back to this place
[9:55] amen I wasn't ministering at that time
[9:59] but it was from that moment I would feel
[10:01] a call
[10:04] and I would actually run from it for
[10:07] many years
[10:09] for about six or seven years
[10:12] and become a very miserable person
[10:16] God knows how to get a hold of you when

[10:24] mercy

[11:17] probably upset at me right now amen
[11:24] Genesis chapter 1 and verse one eins
[11:28] amen it says in the beginning God
[11:31] created the Heaven and the Earth
[11:35] and the Earth was without form and void
[11:38] and darknesses upon the face of the deep
[11:41] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[11:43] face of the waters
[11:52] and God said let there be light and
[11:55] there was light
[11:58] and God saw the light and it was good
[12:01] and God divided the light from the
[12:03] darkness
[12:09] and God called the light day and the
[12:11] Darkness he called night in the evening
[12:14] and the morning were the first day um

[12:53] I can't be anybody else and
[12:57] amen I just want to speak to you this

[13:03] supposed
[13:06] to be like
[13:08] just as I lift amen you know we're
[13:11] living in a very dark World
[13:15] darkness is coming greater and greater
[13:17] every day
[13:20] so I'm very thankful though in this dark
[13:23] time that we live in
[13:26] site in deviant
[13:27] lead but we have
[13:32] ever think but reading in our scripture
[13:34] about the Earth
[13:37] said it was without void
[13:41] without form
[13:43] it was empty it was desolate
[13:48] it was Barren it's about and foreign
[14:45] improved it was greater than the
[14:47] coldness that was upon the Earth it's
[14:49] about gloryside
[14:52] and light began to Dawn upon the Earth
[14:55] Unleashed began ourselves
[14:58] no doubt the Gloom in the darkness tried
[15:01] to hold his position kind of frogs
[15:05] but it could not stay because the spirit
[15:09] was greater
[15:11] guys
[15:12] amen then when you got up this morning
[15:16] the sun was in the sky
[15:20] that's the spoken word of God that's
[15:23] still hanging there today
[15:28] amen you felt this warmth as it begin to
[15:31] warm the Earth
[15:34] it stands there as a sign
[15:38] that the spirit of God is still greater
[15:41] than any darkness that
[15:52] it's greater than any lukewarmness
[15:56] it's greater than any Spirit of the
[15:59] enemy of course I see the geisters amen
[16:02] if we can let the spirit of God move the
[16:04] light will shine remember then guys God
[16:07] is least amen and when the light begins
[16:10] to shine
[16:14] take place
[16:16] the change of lives begin to happen
[16:21] when the spirit of God begins to move
[16:24] and the guys
[16:25] Amen brother Brandon would say it like

[16:42] it

[43:26] not in tables of stone but in fleshly
[43:29] tables of the heart as is
[43:45] and such trust have we through Christ to
[43:48] godwardness
[43:51] to God not that we are sufficient of
[43:54] ourselves to think anything of ourselves
[43:56] but our sufficiency is of God
[44:09] who also has made us able Ministers of
[44:13] the New Testament not of the letter but
[44:15] of the spirit for the letter killeth but
[44:17] the spirit giveth life is
[44:34] so it's not just the word
[44:37] but you also have this have to have the
[44:40] spirit of the word

[46:07] doctor said oh not that Divine Healing
[46:09] preach the word yeah
[46:12] he said the word is what I preach
[46:16] he said brother Brandon the gospel is
[46:19] the word of
[46:22] goddess I said not all together brother
[46:26] the Bible said the gospel came not in
[46:29] this word only but through Power and
[46:32] demonstration of the Holy ghosts
[46:39] Amen to preach the word the letter
[46:42] killeth but the spirit giveth life
[46:50] Jesus said go into all the world and
[46:52] preach the gospel Jesus doctor
[46:56] he said to interpret that that's
[47:00] the Bible means go into all the world
[47:03] and demonstrate the power of the word by
[47:07] the holy ghosts are getting out of the
[47:09] village on psyched the class the
[47:11] smartest house Hallelujah and when it's
[47:14] demonstrated by the power of the Holy
[47:16] Ghost I was convinced this demonstrated
[47:21] since signs and wonders will follow them
[47:26] will take place
[47:28] Deliverance doesn't take place
[47:31] salvation will take place
[47:34] the Holy Ghost will come
[47:37] and feel the vessels of God Amen
[47:42] but he said go preach
[47:45] today we say what signs

[47:56] our neighbors right

[48:03] Jesus says
[48:05] Jesus said these signs shall follow them
[48:07] that belief Jesus talked to dissertation
[48:09] foreign
[48:21] I don't care what anybody else says

[48:50] recover and off the cotton league with a
[48:53] soliden that's the signs that Jesus said
[48:56] thus indications
[49:01] brother Brandon was saying like this in
[49:02] the trial

[49:10] because he's he's the uh uh uh the

[49:16] Holy Spirit should know how to get guys
[49:18] to be able to visit for here's the life

[1:06:14] of a new grandson each
[1:06:16] schizophrenheit we hug and congratulate
[1:06:19] each other
[1:06:21] because my wife had to have a C-section

[1:06:33] he's now turned purple and blue
[1:06:36] and violet he couldn't breathe Kansas
[1:06:39] and they said we got to get him to to
[1:06:42] Extra
[1:07:00] you must have done
[1:07:05] some kind of sin or something
[1:07:08] I started searching my life and I was
[1:07:11] like Lord there be anything
[1:07:15] so in very short moments I had to run
[1:07:18] they had to I believe airlift him to
[1:07:19] another hospital
[1:07:23] so I had my wife in one hospital my baby
[1:07:26] in another hospital about 30 minutes
[1:07:28] away only Flow by an island house with
[1:07:30] my baby
[1:07:32] and I never forget
[1:07:35] them talking with my father especially
[1:07:37] my father he said this has happened for
[1:07:40] a testimony
[1:07:42] God will have a testimony
[1:07:46] and so I I took that in my heart
[1:07:49] yes the devil was still talking in my
[1:07:52] ears
[1:07:54] and so I go one morning to uh get some
[1:07:58] things from my wife when I had a small
[1:07:59] engage

[1:08:10] Bible
[1:08:11] and I heard these words
[1:08:14] you just said Abraham believed in God
[1:08:19] and I turned it off
[1:08:21] instead of Abraham can believe you
[1:08:25] I'm a son of Abraham

[1:28:28] the world foreign
[1:28:56] it's my imagination because they had
[1:29:00] recognized by the harmful

[1:38:05] shouting
[1:38:07] the message given an unknown time
[1:38:11] it brings the spirit of God Among the
[1:38:14] people a splinting guys goddess he said
[1:38:18] you've heard your pastor preach many
[1:38:19] times
[1:38:22] and he would preach unto the spirit God
[1:38:25] Among the people
[1:38:27] they would just scream out well see our
[1:38:30] minds couldn't hold their peace
[1:38:35] the spirit of God takes the word of God
[1:38:38] what does the guys God has lived us vote
[1:38:40] goddess to the congregations
[1:38:43] and it feeds them on this spicy so they
[1:38:47] can grow spiritually on the world
[1:38:53] so if we don't have the spirit of God so
[1:38:55] if anything guys God is least no matter
[1:38:57] how much word you got a god he's been
[1:39:00] vulnerable you cannot grow

[1:39:14] to the people that's lost with
[1:39:16] enlightened so they can live so does
[1:39:19] this live in Canon if it isn't the
[1:39:21] spirit of God it is
[1:39:23] it's man's own intellectual ability and
[1:39:26] this is
[1:39:32] he said in First Corinthians 2 and verse
[1:39:36] my speech and my preaching mine
[1:39:40] was not with enticing words of man's
[1:39:43] Wisdom vanished
[1:39:45] that is mentioned but in demonstration
[1:39:48] of the spirit and the power so I
[1:39:51] couldn't bear them disguises on their
[1:39:53] craft that your faith would not stand in
[1:39:55] the wisdom of men that's the advice
[1:40:03] [Music]
[1:40:06] he said see that's the thing that
[1:40:08] delivers the word he's like
[1:40:11] the word goes out that's what the Holy
[1:40:15] Spirit follows the world hiding a guy's
[1:40:17] positive vote he said your preacher or
[1:40:19] your pastor will preach it it's like the
[1:40:21] Imposter will just prayed again first
[1:40:23] thing you know goes hmm
[1:40:25] across the building goes the Holy Ghost
[1:40:29] it's the conductor of the word it's the
[1:40:33] food
[1:40:37] he said the word is the conductor of the
[1:40:39] spirit is
[1:40:42] where the word is preached
[1:40:45] the spirit will follow
[1:40:48] again wherever it goes with the spirit
[1:40:52] goes he said oh I love sound Bible
[1:40:55] teaching
[1:40:57] but the Holy Ghost has to come back and
[1:41:00] confirm it is
[1:41:06] he said if the Holy Ghost doesn't
[1:41:08] confirm it says then your wires are
[1:41:12] crossed
[1:41:16] but if you can get hooked up the right
[1:41:18] way
[1:41:20] to advise them there's two wires do I
[1:41:24] strike positive and negative positive
[1:41:27] for negative mechanics and Dynamics
[1:41:29] word and spirit forgotten guys
[1:41:34] spirit and Truth
[1:41:36] both as well Fighters
[1:41:40] if you've got them hooked up
[1:41:43] there is something that will move
[1:41:48] hey believe me I used to work with
[1:41:50] electricity
[1:41:52] when you got the when you get a hold a
[1:41:54] whole positive and the negative feather
[1:41:56] than positive
[1:41:58] something's gonna happen
[1:42:01] oh yeah you can be the quietest person
[1:42:04] on the earth
[1:42:10] finger becomes oh you can touch one of
[1:42:12] them
[1:42:13] did not happen nothing happens
[1:42:17] and nothing happens but if you touch
[1:42:20] both of
[1:42:22] them's gonna move
[1:42:26] [Applause]
[1:42:29] listen it's not just mechanics it's
[1:42:32] these numbers but if Brandon would say
[1:42:34] this he said I'm afraid we don't have
[1:42:36] well too long on the mechanics
[1:42:49] we must have both of them working
[1:42:51] together
[1:42:56] [Music]
[1:42:58] amen amen otherwise it's just a good
[1:43:01] intellectual speech this is
[1:43:03] I don't care if he screamed and hollered
[1:43:06] because
[1:43:09] I don't care if you talk real songs
[1:43:11] comes
[1:43:21] I mean you know we built a church
[1:43:25] about just a few years ago from payal
[1:43:28] moved into it in 2017. when since 2010
[1:43:32] and I happen to be chosen to kind of be
[1:43:35] over the projects
[1:43:38] so everything went very good
[1:43:41] till we got to the Sound business
[1:43:46] audio system there's something about
[1:43:48] sound the iceberg
[1:43:52] some people love it some people hate it
[1:43:55] even you in this room right now some is
[1:43:58] too loud some of them yes
[1:44:03] but anyway we we had got bows bows had
[1:44:06] come and designed a specific unit for
[1:44:09] our building oh if you're happy Jesus
[1:44:12] um
[1:44:15] and they gave us a uh a diagram where
[1:44:19] exactly to hang the speakers
[1:44:24] we had to give them every detail
[1:44:27] wherever Pew was how high the platform
[1:44:29] everything
[1:44:34] and they designed their specific unit
[1:44:37] for our building
[1:44:41] and they said to hang it at a certain
[1:44:43] place
[1:44:47] a certain degree
[1:44:49] to point it a certain way
[1:44:52] and
[1:45:01] it's Undead with Afghanistan
[1:45:03] I had to I had to make a
[1:45:07] standard look I'm not calling your
[1:45:10] idiots
[1:45:14] but Bose did not become a multi-billion
[1:45:18] billion company being stupid about these
[1:45:21] lawyers
[1:45:23] they know what they're doing
[1:45:26] so we're going to install it where they
[1:45:28] said install it
[1:45:32] that way if it don't work it's their
[1:45:34] fault
[1:45:36] so we did it was the worst sound ever
[1:45:40] that's why this limpsticks
[1:45:43] see I told you you should hung them here
[1:45:50] finally we got the man
[1:45:52] become that designed it yeah
[1:45:56] they flew all the way from the West
[1:45:58] Coast over to Louisiana
[1:46:00] Business Louisiana
[1:46:03] foreign
[1:46:07] about five of us brothers

[1:46:15] wires and things
