streaming will be streaming this service on their [Music] zoom and so I greet all the Saints at evening light God bless each and every one of you I just have something that the Lord laid on my heart to share with you this evening [Music] and I trust and pray that you give me your undivided [Music] attention uh God bless you musicians that's all the singing We Shall do so we are sing We are reading out of uh First Corinthians 1 Corinthians chapter 13 we are beginning to read from verse one and we shall read up to verse 8 amen though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity and wherever they've written charity please replace it with love it's the same thing so then I will use the word love love suffereth long and is kind love envieth not love vth not itself it is is not P up do not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things Love Never Fails but where where whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall seize whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away love never fails praise God come amen you may be seated may the Lord bless the reading of the word and may he speak to us this evening so I just want to speak to you on and being that we also ministering on Zoom it is always go can only go for one hour so I just want you attention so we can just go right quick through amen and uh I just want to speak on AAP versus F love so all right so we will maybe get to explain that a little later but AAP AAP is divine love yeah love or or the love of God yeah and F love is uh the human love amen do you if you are close to somebody ask them do you love me do you love me brother of course I love you my pastor praise God Amen so now each of you what were you told probably somebody say that they do it they love you but tonight I want us to find out whether that person truly loves you what is love you see we have a wrong conception many times a wrong conception of love and I know that we are in a generation whereby this word is used so many times until it has come to a place where even it has devalued or lost its real meaning whereby we are not able to know or to understand whether truly somebody loves you or not some somebody will find a girl out there that maybe she's a chorus girl or a street girl and then they would say to them that I love you and and I don't know whether there's somebody here who has ever suffered or who has been victim of what I'm going to say now you go on your phone you never met the person you do not know them and because you've been exchanging back and forth texts and uh you you just develop feelings for them and then you kind of feel that you really love them and then you begin speaking as if it were that you were cting and there many times we've seen and heard that many girls have been heartbroken the by boys that spoke to them for a long time and then eventually said I'm sorry I'm not going to marry you oh then of course maybe sometimes even they would not tell them that I'm going to marry someone else they'll just hear when the person is already married and many would even tell you that I love you and then marry you and then leave you and then they have words they use like I will love you until let Victoria dries I will love you until East Meets West I will love you until it is no longer raining I will love you with my whole heart and words that are so so powerful they will try to Define love by their words but even those that try to use those words many times still it failed and and sometimes we think it's only among the young people but I want to tell you no it's not even among the older ones you find marriages failing at uh 50 60 years someone 50 years old filing for divorce 70 60 but but then yet if you go back 50 or 40 years ago and you asked them one of them or both of them whether or they loved each other they will tell you that truly we love one another we shall grow all together and nothing will be able to separate us and nothing can come between us and then again you find that it fails maybe after 10 or 20 years after 30 years 40 years sometimes 50 50th year you find others divorcing and so then you wonder was it love to begin with because according to what we have read in the Bible in the book of First Corinthians the Bible says that love in verse 8 chapter 13:8 Love Never Fails tell your neighbor Love Never Fails if you love that love cannot fail so if truly those people loved each other they cannot divorce because that love that binds them is so strong that it cannot fail find that it is not really love what we really call many times love is not really love but it is human love and human love is not really love True Love Never Fails true love is not selfish true love will be patient true love will not envy it will not be P it will think no evil it will not bust itself it will bear all things and believe all things true love will endure all things everything else can fail a prophecy can fail tongues can fail knowledge can fail and everything can vanish away but there is one thing that cannot fail and that is love [Music] and so I'm going to talk to you tonight about [Music] love but then of course speak about the two types of love are you following me tonight the message do you now believe he says now there is two different kinds of Love there is human love which is in Greek which in a Greek word is f love and then love which is high love or Divine love everybody say so those are the two kinds of love now you take like the pH love when we have that love a mother for her baby will drive her right straight to a flaming fire to save that baby's life it will make a man for his sweet heart laid down his life any time what I mean is that is just human love but yet that love is also powerful in a way that kind of love can actually make a woman it can make a mother desire to go uh Through Fire to be able to save her child you know brother Solomon if you have that kind of love and you you have a woman you want to marry or a woman that you Mar you will have you have feelings that make you want to do anything any time for her to the extent that you can actually give your own life because these are to you more than feelings it's like a definition of what you have in your heart it is so powerful that you are willing to lay down your life and yet is just a human feeling and that too can fail that two can fail that two is not permanent that has failed many times over we can never rely on that and the problem is many Christians have relied on this human love andam says that I believe in somewhere in the Bible it say and we read it shortly could a mother forget her little suckling baby but maybe make but I can never forget you for for you are engraved in the palms of my [Music] hand let us read it out of Isaiah 49 verse 14 but Zion said the Lord has forsaken me and my Lord has forgotten me can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yeah they may forget yet will I not forget the behold I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy words are continually before me allow me to tell you something tonight that here is God speaking to his children and he's saying the Lord Zion is saying the Lord has forsaken me you know wherever he's saying Zion put your name there amen hallelujah is saying just put your name there put your name there Andrew is saying someone is saying who is saying tonight maybe you are saying my sister praise God somebody is saying Solomon is saying is saying John is saying you are saying that the Lord has forsaken me my Lord has forgotten me how many times have you felt that way that your prayers are not being answered that God has forgotten you that God has not heard your prayer that God is not hearing your cry many times we feel that way but he he asks a question can a woman forget her sucking child can a woman really do that just told us that a woman with a baby in fire she will do everything even if it means to go she will go in that fire to die while saving her child in some of the things and the news that came up out of out of Israel it is said that when the when the Hamas came you know they bur down some Israelis and to the to the point that they could not recognize who is who but then they found something like a a mother who was hugging her child so the mother was trying to protect the child so that the child will not burn but then both of them burned and Di but then here he asks a question can a mother forget her scking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her Wom everywhere has failed you know we have a proverb here that says gives birth to something bad will always be pity to eat whether your child is bad or whether your child is good or done good things or done bad things the father may even dis own the child but a mother a mother's compassion will go so far always defend that child be there for that child regardless of the age of that child because the mother's compassion is usually very strong towards the child and now God asks a question can a mother with a sucking child forget that child you might say no but here is what God is saying even with all the compassion she has for her child she can forget she can forget and we have many mothers like that who forget maybe you are one of those have been forgotten by your natural parents maybe abandoned by your natural parents May abandoned by your father maybe abandoned by your mother and you feel lonely and you feel alone you've not got that compassion you don't know what it means to have a mother's love you don't know what it means to have a Father's Love and yet it is something wonderful God is saying here through the word even with that compassion of a parental they can forget yes they can forget are you hearing me tonight yeah they can forget but he says but I will not forget you amen I rejoice in that amen tell somebody I rejoice in that I rejoice in that I rejoice in that he says I will not forget you this is not just logos written down here it is coming out of the pages of the Bible and I want come down to your heart amen this evening it is not just written here God is saying I will not forget you I will not forget you the world can forget you the can forget you I cannot forget you and he says behold why can't you forget you he says I've Graven you upon the palm of my hand Hallelujah am thy words are continually before me whenever God just does like this he sees you because you are in the palm of his you are in his hands he cannot forget Others May forsake you God cannot forget you because his love is permanent his love is genuine his love is original Hallelujah Hallelujah God praise God a woman will forget her second child a husband will forget his wife a wife will forget her husband a child forget his parents parents will forget the child God cannot forget if God ever loved you once he will love you always if God chose you once he will choose you always if you are an elect of God no matter what sin you have done in your life it cannot separate you from the God will always choose you always love you because you are in him and he's in you he Chen you before the found he has loved you before you knew it the of God it can go even to the deepest hell Hallelujah God is love is so powerful that's the kind of love I want but pH love a woman with a sucking child will forget a father will forget a mother will forget a sister will forget husband will forget a wife will forget but God will not forget so if you've been forgotten by somebody that you thought loved you don't be surprised don't feel unloved amen that love is bound to Faith there is only one kind of love that never fails that is agap love every other love will fil it will all break into pieces always remains in the book of Jeremiah 17: 5 the scripture says thus sayth the Lord C be the man that trusts in man mhm and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart depart from the Lord for he shall be like the heath in the desert and shall not see when good cometh but shall inhabit the patched places in the wilderness in a so land and not inhabited hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Church the Bible is saying to us something here very powerful that a man or a human being that trust in another human being is not blessed that is cast if you make flesh your arm know we have a saying that I need arm to lean on need a heart to confide in let me tell you among a human being there is no arm you can lean on there is no heart you can conf even if your wife or husband mother or daughter whatever it doesn't matter the B did not say be a man in a man except when they are married no he said it doesn't matter who you are what relationship you have says cast be the man that trust in a man you cannot trust in a man you cannot put your trust and confidence in a human being no wonder brother bham told us no circumstance unbeliever there is a reason why it's about love love between a Believer and unbeliever is nonexistent it is does not exist let us bring it to another level even in the church if you want to marry somebody or get married to somebody both of you don't have the Holy Spirit there is no love between you there is no pure love between you what you have is is human love love it is powerful in its own [Music] ranks but it is not that holding it's not that powerful it will fail sometime that's why a Believer is a woman or man who is filled with the power of the Holy Ghost and if you're filled with the Holy Ghost and somebody else is filled with the Holy Ghost you will love one another forever why because it's not about you it's not about your feelings it's not about what you feel what you think it's about that which is in you it's about he that is in [Music] you can never fa God is love but a man that trusts in a man is cast where he lives praise God praise God his heart has already departed from the Lord praise God he will be in a Wilderness in PCH places my God and that's how many human beings live but the scripture goes ahead to tell us but blessed is the man that trust in the Lord and whose hope is in the Lord my hope is in the Lord my hope is in the LA my hope is not in science my hope is not in my job my hope is not in the people my hope is not in my pastor my hope is not in my friend my wife my husband my hope is in the Lord Brother sister put your hope in the Lord put your confidence in the Lord he can never disappoint you he can never fail he is only faithful he alone is faithful he cannot fail we trust in the Lord put your confidence in the Lord trust in the Lord always no matter what you you you you put in in man it is just waiting for judgment because it shall fail how many words even today even right now as I'm speaking how many people have are speaking these words but I trusted you but I trusted you how could you do this how could you disappoint friends trusted the wrong person never trust a man trust God in the man trust God in the man if you want to get married don't trust the woman don't trust the man trust God in that man TR God in the woman that is the thing of God that will never for that is wo hallelujah how many times have they said feel I love you love love for you is all over my body I can't even understand anymore I'm just feeling crazy I'm feeling like crazy because I love yeah it is true but it is not genuine don't trust that and if you trust it the Bible says you are C because the Cur will follow in John 13 let me show you example of what I'm talking about4 here comes Peter script says and a new new commandment I give unto you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another this is Jesus speaking praise God Jesus did not listen listen Jesus did not tell them love one another as you feel according to your feeling it says don't love one another according to your feeling love one another as I have loved [Music] you what love did he have he was a he was divine he was God and he was telling us to love one another with by this by love shall all men know that ye are my disciples if he have love one to another Simon Peter said unto him Lord thou goest or go thou Jesus answered demon whether I go thou cannot follow me now why can't you follow me because the road I'm going is only for those with AAP if you don't have you cannot stand the test you cannot stand the tribulation of the journey I am taking you cannot stand this right now but later you will right now Peter you have no you will be offended you will walk away you cannot go through with this but thou shall follow me afterwards let me tell you if you do not have pure love if you don't have real love genuine love perfect love you cannot follow Jesus somewhere and it fails and many Believers are believers with ph love they don't have they believe the word in its log form but they don't go an extra mile to get agap power in their [Music] hearts so then they can't follow Jesus Christ when tribulations come when problems come they fall away they walk away they just can't follow Christ it becomes difficult for them but even at that time Peter said unto him Lord why can I not follow you now do you know what is in me my heart do you know how I feel about how can you say I can't follow you this is Peter telling Jesus that your judgment is wrong you don't know what I feel for you how can you say I can't follow you now my love for you is full my feeling for you is top how can you say that that means you don't know me how can you say I can follow you now I in will lay down my life for your sake let me tell you the truth I love you so much I'm ready to die for you men have told women and brother bam actually to and he said a girl that loves a woman will do anything and everything for her why because he loves her will will die for her give himself for Herer had the same for Jesus he said do you know me I will give myself my very life for you but at this time Peter did not have a even in that he testif even if I have all I know I love you so much I believe in you so much and I'm ready to die for you this is the love the people have for their kings fall I will follow the same thing where you will die is where I will die had the same you die I will die ready let me ask a question do you think Peter was faking it answer me if I say he was genuine do you believe [Music] me he was genuine as far as is concerned he needed power Jesus answered him will you lay down your life for my S lay your life for me let me tell you the co shall not craw till you have denied if you if you were Peter how would you have looked it's just like a a brother who Wants to Marry a little sister say I love you I'm ready to do anything for you my Romeo I'm ready to die for you if they don't want me to marry you I will leave all my clan and and then here Juliet say you lay your life for me before tomorrow you will deny me and reject me three times how that man look do you know what you're talking about I mean this what do you want me to do now to prove that's how Peter was that's how he felt it was F of love and later on bring a child only little girl and Peter would say no I don't know him I've never seen him in my life said no with him what are you talking about the man rejected Jesus like he had never been with him but Jesus knows who are he knows who are he he knows who I is praise God praise God that's why you do not know the heart of a man you don't know the heart of a woman but God knows every heart that's even to you who want to go and get married before anything pray seek for the will of God for the mind of God God will reveal to you what you did not know you you are seeing a brother jumping up and down in the church and saying hallelujah amen but God is saying something else when you go to prayer God will show you that one is a beast and you say no God please at least speak to me one more time God will show you it is a beast no at least speak to me one more time God will show you it is a CR oh no oh no oh no God show me something nice is a pig you say oh no God you have finished me because my feelings are dying for this person let me tell you God knows each heart the Bible says the word of God is a design the thoughts and intents of a man that's why when you are going to look for a wife or a husband do it within that context of the word you will never be deceived praise God praise God chch so now we'll see at John in John 21:15 later on after after Jesus's resurrection he comes back to Peter so when they had died Jesus said unto Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me more than this still at this time Peter did not have a Jesus comes back again to him do you love me more than this he said unto him yeah Lord yeah Lord th knowest that I love you now you are seeing two you you are seeing two different two you are seeing the same words love but let me break it down for you Jesus said unto Simon Peter Simon son of [Music] Jonas do you have agap love for me more than this and Peter answered him yeah Lord you know that I love you with [Music] ph he said unto him all right feed my LS he said to him again the second time but Simon son of Jon th me he said unto him Lord you know that I have a lot of feelings for you you know I'm ready to die for you you know I have a lot in my heart I will follow you until I die he said him feed my sheep Jesus is trying to say something if you have Divine love you have read it he said that charity not her own is not selfish Peter is saying Jesus I love you I want you I want to follow you say no I'm saying something else if you truly love me my sh it's not about you Peter when you receive it will no longer be about you Peter it will be about my not your [Music] selfishness my desire he said again if you don't get it yet you will get it soon he says feed my sheep and he said unto him the third time Simon son of Jonas do you have power Peter was grieved loveed not not gri what talking about Peter you just showed yourself not someone that's please members that is not was GRE because Jesus said it the thir time but he said Lord you know all things you know that I love you Jesus said unto him if then you love me myip did Peter understand no he did not understand until came in his heart when came in his Peter didn't understood fully Jesus my sheep are you following me at first with thought it was all about him and Jesus it is just a selfish kind of thing but later on when did he receive when the of Pentecost was fully they were all together in one place and then there came tongues like a fire Hallelujah and divided itself among the disciples each of them received a leak of fire a leak of fire a leak of fire a Le of fire a Le of fire and they began speaking in they began speaking in Tong dancing around like and czy like drunk and propes and when people came and say you are drunk these early hours of the morning sister Juliet jul that's what they thought but do you know who these people were they were the Sheep Jesus was talking about if you receive the Revelation now say Amen those were the Sheep you drunk this early hours of the morning and Jesus said brother Peter said Peter was s just like the rest of them speaking in Tong and prophesying but then he came out it now made sense feed my sheep feed my sheep oh get now it's not about me man of Juda hear me hear me these are not drunk with wine as you suppos with the power of the Holy Ghost this is that that was spoken by the prophet John oh hallelujah oh h hallelujah hallelujah and Peter spoke according to the power of the Holy Ghost by demonstration of the power of the Holy Ghost and the Bible says at the end of his speaking they began bleeding as Sheep amen am men and Brethren what shall we do and Peter said hallelujah praise God every one of you baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and he shall be forgiven your sins for receiving the power of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and when he said that one by one am am that's one Sheep amen that's another sheep am how many sheep one day 3,000 sheep were well by somebody who truly LED Jesus when you receive you love Jesus truly and if you love Jesus truly you are going to be concerned about the truth you can't keep it yourself the reason why you do not tell others about this message is because you do not have AG but if you receive you will tell others about this ENT message you will tell others the end is is sooner you will tell others that the rapt is coming soon you will tell others it's almost time over you'll be on fire for this message why because you have AG what is Philadelphia pH brotherly kindness an age of Brotherly Love what happened it was a missionary Edge because they loved one another they took the message all over the world if you understand that say wait until the Holy Ghost comes but before that you'll be selfish praise God many young men tell ladies I love you but because they want to defile them I love you when you get what you want you know why because it is f of love fth is not true love Romans 9 let's see something else here as it is written Jacob have I loved but es have I hated praise God everybody say praise God so you see Jacob have I loved but have I hated can you imagine who love Jacob who love Jacob Sorry God loved Jacob who hated God hated praise God but let us go to genes 25 vers 27 and the boys grew and Esau was a canning Hunter a man of the field and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents and Isaac loved is because he did eat of his venon Rea Lov Jacob hallelujah hallelujah so God hated who but apparently loved him Isaac LED remember why did Isaac love please read your Bible properly Isaac was a man of God he had a promise that God gave Abraham there is no way he had a wrong Spirit but he loved a man that God hated how can that happen is it possible what kind of love do we have are they loving with the same kind of love it is impossible if God loved if God hated he did not love him and the love of God was with Jacob not es and if Isaac was to love with he was supposed to love Jacob but apparently Isaac did not love Jacob but he loved is don't forget he did eat of his ven so you see will be connected to what you are getting in it I love you because you're Beau [Music] I love you because you're the best of the best if you have a reason why you love them and that's not the love God is telling us to God had no reason abely no reason no reason that God should love a sinner such as I what did I have what did I do what did I give you nothing but he yet loved me before I knew him and he chose me before the foundation of the world he loved you before you knew him nothing you do nothing you did that will separate that love of God you that love is not based on actions that love is bested on his desire bested on his will Hallelujah God loved you God loved me because he loved me he didn't love me because I was good he L me because he loved me oh how he love me I know not why I only [Music] cry he loved me his love will even go for me when I'm in hell his Love Will Find me everywhere his love found me in sin found me in that fil his love picked me out brought me here hallelujah he cannot forsake he canot fa me he is faithful every promise he me was UN condition he gave it to me because he led me and that's the love of God and if you love somebody if it's with the love of God it is unconditional do this and I will love you I love you because you I love you because you have cash I love you because you know you're beautiful from a rich family because your feet looks nice eyes are so beautiful and everything and I kind of feel if I marry you I'm going to have children not that's not that's feel it's not and that one will fail you can love even a sinner and want to marry them the F love but will not allow you to love a sinner to have them as a wife or praise God make you want to share the gospel of Salvation with so they can know what you know and have what you have God's love is UN conditional it is perfect love and I want to finish with this quot praise God in the message he must be born again God the Great Master rainbow SK we would say like that with the seven spirits of God perfect love now after perfect love comes from that's the love that you have for your wife if some man would insult her you would shoot his brains because it creates a jealousy but that's secondary love not important water done love then comes after there is a here then comes down here then he says then comes last for another man's wife you say when I love you but she's somebody's you don't want to marry her but you want to go with her that is last call it what it is it is last when I see you I feel Elric going through that is last it's not last it is last that's what they have out there in the world every human being has that until they receive the power of the Holy Ghost it silences [Music] it then comes last after that comes fil it just becomes perverted what is f prostitution you find them they have nothing for one another but they just want to relax let off the pressure just go buy a PR here know because you want money not because you have lost that Ms and inject themselves so they can behave like maniacs or animals why it is the filth and some people call it love but it's all filth perverted but all of this kind of love had a beginning but when that real genuine love of God that I've been talking about oh hallelujah hallelujah church when that genuine love of God been talking about when it comes into the human being by the New Birth by being born again it has no beginning it will have no end you are the Son of God then a daughter of God then and your affections are on things about love will make you shoot a man for insulting your wife will make you pray for his that is the difference so you must be born again on our I'll continue with that later
