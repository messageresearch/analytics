this sister was also is part of our fellowship there on Mondays um and I heard that you came ready for water baptism is that so ready for water baptism praise God Amen God is doing a wonderful work in amst those young people amen so vers [Music] 14 and we shall read up to 16 and unto the angel of the Church of the Lans write this things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of [Music] God turn Brother Martin can you come up and [Music] help okay so we read verse 15 I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I spew thee out of my [Music] mouth [Music] [Music] praise God shall we ask speak to the Lord for just a moment father we have just read a portion of your holy word we now ask you to come and help us to step out of the way Lord you know I I have nothing of my own they just the gift that you've given to me to bless your people and I realize it's not mine it is for your people Lord and Lord as we've been told that a gift is just a man taking himself out of the way and letting God use that gift and Lord I know that these people also have the power to to to uh make it work by receiving and saying Amen to the may you speak to each one of them in Jesus name amen please be seated praise God so I'm speaking to you today on the subject of the lukewarm church the lukew church on vers 16 he said because you are Lam and neither cold nor hot I will speak the out of my mouth we are at a time when history is being fulfilled we are at a time that we call the end and it is surely the end and you see the Bible says there is no new thing under the Earth whatever has whatever is has been and whatever will be shall be again there was once a time on Earth that was called the end time and there were men of God like for instance Noah that God sent to preach an end time message but if it was the end God Was preparing to destroy the world with water and water would come from above and water would come from below the Earth and and the people did not hear Noah but the word of God that he had given to Noah came to pass 100% but I want to show you something here that we have arrived at another end time in the days of Noah he destroyed the world with water but in these days our days he has promised to destroy the world with fire if you you you check with me in the Book of Malachi chapter chapter 4 is just one of those many scriptures that's the first verse for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yeah and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of host that it shall leave them neither [Music] rootch that day is coming and that day is going to be hot the Bible says as we have read it shall burn as an oven if you continue reading the Bible says that the righteous shall St over the ashes of the wicked that is going to happen there is going to be a time that the wicked shall be ashes under the the feet of the righteous the wicked are those that do not accept the end time message the wicked are those when God sends his message they it they don't receive it just carry on in their own denominations in their own beliefs in their own systems so they don't give honor to the word of God and and the righteous are those that accept the message of the hour when I say the message of the hour I mean the message that God sends in that given time in every time God sends is a special message for that generation and those who receive that message they will be considered righteous and they will be taken in the Rapture and the rest of the people shall go in a tribulation and all the elements will burn up end of the tribulation part of the burning will come from the Armageddon we third world war and part of the elements that will burn the Earth will come out of that why do you think that America has um uh you know weapons that can actually literally destroy the whole world Russia has weapons that can actually wipe out America from the and all I always on tension why do you think America did not just go to fight Russia because Russia has nuclear weapons and and America will go and Destroy Libya because they have to fear Libya does did not have nuclear weapons and why is America trying to fight Iran from receiving or or making nuclear weapons because if Iran gets nuclear weapon they will also become Untouchable any nation that has nuclear weapons is considered a great nation why because nuclear war can literally destroy the world you see our Prophet brother bham said something down there in Russia maybe someone who is drunk or someone who is you know a little off and start a new war and we see that those things are bound to happen and the fire all this fire power that all these nations have you know it has to be put to use one day it has to be put to use one day the all way to the people who shall be on Earth at that time it will be a great time of Destruction pain and suffering it is bound to happen it is going to happen are you hearing me Church America will fight with Russia and Russia and America and then other countries combined together and we notice here that when this happens it will cause a third world war this is the war that the Bible calls Armageddon I'm glad I will not be here during that time I'm glad I'll will be taken up in the Rapture I'll be out of here it should be your goal too it should be your goal too and we notice that when this happens it will destroy everything thing on earth it will destroy the civilization as we know it today will destroy America that people crave to literally go to it will destroy Canada it will destroy New Zealand it will destroy the UK as we know it will destroy Australia AAL there will not be first world second world and third world countries it will be all turned to us it will all be turned to us are you hearing me that's why your goal should not be to go to America your goal should be to go to the Rapture it doesn't matter which country you'll be in at time the Judgment of God will strike and it will strike everybody and then the Bible says they that fear the name of the Lord shall step over those the wicked they will be because the wicked shall be like ashes under their feet those fires will destroy even all the religions and the churches it will even destroy Vatican destroy all the systems of man there will be no system of government that shall remain are you hearing me it will all be wiped out all everything will be wiped removed why because God will be preparing to bring down his kingdom Marin spoke on let thy kingdom come and part of what I'm speaking is really inspired by here someone the whole kingdoms of the world will be wiped up God shall have another kingdom and this Kingdom will not be his alone it will be his together with his [Applause] bride the one that was vict torious the one the Bible speaks of and he says to him that shall overcome there is going to be one that will overcome in every generation I don't know about you but I believe I am one of those in my generation I'm one of the over you must step on sin now in order for you to step on the Wicked then praise God yes sir and then they that you shall overcome shall be together with him and the Bible says we shall re with him for 1,000 years one day with the Lord is like a thousand years 1,00 years is like one day so if he says we shall re with him for 1,000 years how many years do you think it will be it's going to be a really long time and we will re with him the wicked will be ases under our there will be people that will survive areon and they will remain here on Earth but we the bride will rule over them the Bible says they shall multiply like the sons of the sea they will amen they will be having children and multiplying quickly but they will not live in the city with us they will be the commoners we shall be the Lords we shall be in the palace with the king in the palace here on Earth not Heaven Millennium is going to be down here we shall have bodies bodies that can walk is amen we shall be almost like we are now only that we shall be superhumans whereby the people who are out of the city they cannot even try to understand what we are made of that's why they have even even acted movies out of those and then they there's a movie they acted I think it was called 2012 and they said the whole world was destroyed with nuclear power and then aliens came from heaven and they came and when the people came out of their bankers billat and others who having bankers when they came out they realized that you know the world is taken over by aliens let me bring understanding to you these Bill Gates and the rich people of the world they the only ones with the power to hide under Bankers these great people of the world today in that next World there will be the common Hallelujah and then the Bride of Jesus will come from heaven will come from Heaven together with Jesus Christ and we shall come down here on Earth and a city will be created down here and this will be a holy city we shall live in there no sin will go in there listen to me we will not be aliens but to the others we shall be like aliens because we will not grow old we will not die we will be perfect we can appear and disappear we have superow we shall be like God and we shall dwell in the land of the living here on Earth and we shall rule with him for a space of 1,000 years hallelu God amen he will give us domain you is the America you your is this one is Uganda I don't know which one you want to R during that time oh my God oh my God some of you you will be how many continents do we have how many do we have seven continents do you know which how many generations of the Bride is going to be there seven generations seven Church ages out of each Church age each bride single bride will have a amen we will rule this world and the others will be below us now this is going to happen we may not even have an idea on how it will be but it must happen for him to be God for him to keep his word for him to keep his appointments I said I will re on Earth what about the devil there is no way the devil can be on earth when we are here you know what happens before we come down amen the Bible says the devil was bound in Chains and he was thrown into the bottomless pit and the lead was covered but right now the bottomless pit is open and all the demons are here on Earth but there is coming a Time When sin will not rain over bodies that there will be no temptation there will be no sorrow there will be pain there will be no poverty there will not be any problem because the devil will be in the bottomless I can't wait for that time because I will then laugh over the devil because this will be my time of rejoicing that's why the Bible says Rejoice not against me my en when I fall I shall rise right now I am here falling in this body but one day I'm going to arise I will arise out of this body these B of B will open up and my soul will come out and I will have another body Rejoice not against me or my enemy I sit in darkness the Lord shall be my light and then he continues on and he says then he that was my enemy shall see it and shame shall cover her him that said where is your god that time of the Millen will be our time ashame the devil completely and because it is our time to prove we are in charge Hallelujah right now we are potentially in charge in Heavenly places and when we come out of Heaven places and we come here in noral daylight we get tempted and tried and then we sing a song why it should be the but wait a moment time is coming when that song will be completely gone the Bible say and they will sing a new song hallelujah hallelujah amen we shall have a new song we will no longer sing tempted and TR we will sing We are in charge we we will sing We are the and we are here we are here to stay we are here to rule we are here there will be nothing like humility at that time let me not speak big things no we will say it because that's how we shall be we are that's why even the Bible says right now we are Royals we are Kings and Priests with God at that time we shall exercise it physically and spiritually and everything I'm saying it is already here potentially praise God and if a child of God born again knows their place they can exercise that power even right now hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah I can't wait for that time I will be there these days when they making events they make small videos and some I will be there I will be there oh my I'm making mine today I will be there what about you better say I will be there too be there come on let's go there that's our plan that's our purpose nothing here should will hinder us I won't let nothing here in the me for somay there's a blessed crown that I must wear I will not let nothing here in the me I will not let sin hind me I will not let feelings hinder me I not let heart breaks hinder me I not let nothing hinder me no friends friends will not hinder me the love of the world will not hinder me everything you can love today in the Millennium you will have it 100 your joy shall be full brother sister prepare for that place and now we see that there is Seven Ages and from Ephesus SEL all these ages but the last one is going to be that one is going to be the last last and when the saints that shall be at they would say we are in the end time that when that age of comes nothing left but the Rapture after the rupture millenum you understand me so where are we now we are we have arrived at the last one but the Bible has this to say about because the devil knows this is the last chance he has he has to capture as many as possible he has to hind as many as possible he's trying his best to hind them and he says to the Church of the Lans this is verse 14 now Revelation 3 right this thing say the amen the faithful and true [Music] witness the beginning of the creation of God he speaking to the church now is a combination of the true church and the church just like every other Church age has been but the condition of the time of [Applause] church is this way let me give you a little bit of background here was a city in Asia Minor in present day Turkey and there was a river that came down [Music] through it came in h but by the time it would arrive at the temperatures would [Music] change it would not be cold it would not be and then was used as a symbol of the last age which we are now leaving it was a symb of the last church last gentle dispensation the church is not cold the church is not hot the church is in the middle inop we the middle so that because he says because you are you are not hot how many have ever drunk or put in the mouth [Music] you feel like vomiting the church isuk it's not hot not C you have people that are both Sinners and Believers at the same time people that live kinds of life people who are in church but they practice witcraft people that are called by the name of a Believer but they are fornicators people who are in the church they are called Christians but they are very good liars did you know Liars have their place in the in Hell Fire Liars are going to go to hell there's no better way about that and has Believers in the church but they tell lies tell lies and a person tells a lie and is not moved a bit he just moves on right on it's all right a church people who come to church and they are thieves and there is no small thief or Big Thief if you are a thief you a thief the Bible did not say big and smallen a little you are a thief no matter what you have stolen I hope you like me after this you have people who are in the church and they just go they're not mared but they are living like husband and wife and they come to church and they begin singing the grace of God and because the pastor preached with their long painted nails they begin touching their eyes because they are crying the pastor preach about if it wasn't for Grace with this fornication I'm living I would have died after after that they go back to why because they are not convicted it is a lukewarm Church they are not cold they are not hot this is a generation where Christian girls will dress like prostitutes you know we used to differentiate between a Christian and prostitute by the way they dress are you hearing me a Christian woman like a Christian but they pastors they L pastors they have said to them don't worry sister God sees your heart I believe that but why do I call them L because they did not tell them the next thing God sees your heart but what you do on the outside shows what is in your heart it means you are not changed it means you not convicted of sin it means you have not yet found a savior but when you find a savior you will throw away those trouser sisters you will throw away the Min you will away the Mak jeel you will throw it away you will know there is one thing to be a Christian and another to be World there must be a distinction between the church and the world but today the Believers the ones who are professing the name of Jesus they are not hot they are not cold they are lukew they in the middle and maybe you are one of them today if you're one of them today my prayer for you today is that you will not walk out of that door until you found salvation because you can find it you may walk out and that may be your last time to come to church and the Rapture will happen and you will not know it has happened even when you know you will have no nothing completely to do oh God help you the lukew [Music] church God help this generation where Christians stay at home and they they don't go to church during a service look one Church where Believers are now worshipers of Television it's not okay for you to smoke but it's okay for you to watch somebody who is smoking and enjoy it and you call it entertainment how can a Believer let a sinner entertain him how can that happen you are a Christian you don't enjoy alcohol when someone brings it to you I'm a Believer but on your phone on the videos you watch the movies you watch the telion you watch it's all about drun and drinking and those are your favorite movies let me tell you you are lukew you yourself you're a drunker and you don't know when God comes down to judge he doesn't judge only Sinners he judges even those who have pleasure in those that do those things needs to be a distinction between Holiness and sin between the world and the church you need to take a stand and say here I stand I'm a Christian and that is what I am I am going to be known by what I feed on I am going to be known by what I am doing my life is a testimony there are people who cannot read the Bible I am there working Bible I want them to look at me even if they have never read the Bible I want them to know Jesus but what is happening the church is lukew you look at a Christian today is not in church you will not know they Christian second second Timothy chapter 3 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own [Music] selves you cannot do anything even for God if you don't have AIT you'll be asking a question what is he need for me Pastor is very busy telling you let collect for money for land fund said no what do he need for me Brothers Andre is going to I don't have money and then now when you go out there they tell you your your aunt is dead raise two millions in one day lovers of their own selves you need to understand what I'm preaching is biblical when you read your Bible the first church do you know how they were the Bible says they had all things in common the rich and the poor were all the same you know why if we do what they did then they will call us a cult today the pastor gave them an instruction that every one of you should sell all your your things everything sell it and bring your money we are going to sit down and we going to divide that money equally among ourselves some of you already are planning to leave the church that is how the first church did and when they did that one brother and his wife they they were look they said we worked for many years and we know very how can we divide our riches with him they said now my wife Let Us sell after we sell we take some piece for ourselves and then they remainder can give to them to they even came later at church if you come later church let me hope it's not being lukewarm these unever came later says if you have the Holy Ghost you cannot wait for the doors of the church to you want to go you want to be the first you want even to come and clean you want to find what can I do how can I make myself useful in the house of if I don't have money to give to the land fund what can I do what can I do let me encourage others to give let me pray let me go and pray in other words you'll be on fire for the things of God but the church is look and this couple an and saf it was the brother that walked in first and he took his seat Pastor Peter said brother first come here said yes Pastor he said is this old money that you sold brother yes what was that a li Gody a Believer telling a lie no you don't and you wonder why you don't Prosper you wonder why everything you dig someone buries

Kingdom you are not obeying the rules you have to do according to the rules you don't pay TI and you expect to have increase that can never happen you are dreaming if you are in this Kingdom you have to be hot if you are lukew it is going to be very difficult and you wonder why things are not going well is this all that you sold his he was like after all it is my land no one for me so yes this is all we've and a pastor stood before him and he said you did not lie to me but you lied the Holy Spirit and that moment that second the man fell down and died yes you heard me right he died he was not Resurrected he Di and the pastor called some stronger deons come and carry him away they buried him away and they took him anded him yes sir we are talking about what is written here if that happened today would close down our church because he would be considered to be a c but it happened here and the brother was buried and his wife came I believe she was having those high heels with with her painted lips and she had cut off all this and she had painted it with those long earrings and the painted nails and then start walking in the CH that kind of sister is not here you you are good sister

husband before he said let it take you and They carried her to and theyed we always say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday done forever do you think he's not the same today if he's the same today he must do the same things not only the good ones but also the bad ones am so if you plan to be l i want you to know there is a cost there is a cost of being L that's why he even said it is better for you to be cold if you can't be hot be cold if you can't be a genuine believer and go to the world do the things of the world World be a good worldly person be a good sinner it is better than being in the church and you lukew because the cost is so de and he said why it is better you be C hot because you are larm he says I will SP you out of my mouth vom them agitated God you realize your wrong behaviors your lies your un living itates the Holy [Music] Ghost and he says men are lovers of their own selves men are vious you just want what belongs to another if you are at a level in your life where you have not attained things that others have attained follow the process you shall attain it too and this is not only on individual level find the level of churches churches compete teachers are competing pastors are competing musicians are competing leaders are compe they conversions of one another it's a wrong spirit it's a spirit of is a spirit CH you have to help me to I have to do this because we need to go in the rapture the only way is to be born again filled with the power of the Holy Ghost to be on fire for God that's the only way Busters you find them boasting they believe they better than the other one it's a wrong spirit it's a l Spirit a Believer should never burst they think you're better than others be yourself be humble they are proud they are blasphemers blasphemers disobedient to parents and thankful and holy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers [Music] in Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors traitors everybody said traitors this is what this generation is you do something with someone and you plan properly and they are traitors they sell you over to your enemy is a spirit of thee Spirit of preach to somebody don't like me I see it in another way that other way is demonic the only right way is the way of word is what God is saying a Believer is supposed to say to every word of God Amen but they are he praise God they LS of Pleasures more than lovers of God when you bring pleasure everybody is in it if I said here today church we we are organizing a party everybody should bring 200,000 before the

business is what God's business and if you do God's business God will do your business if you do God's business God will take care of your education if you do God's business will take care of your job he will take care of your business are you hearing me at 15 years when I started preaching in this message later on I think I was about 19 or something that I decided to go into full-time Ministry and I I made up my mind to drop out of school I was in university and I dropped out I told my mother I'm going to drop out because I have to take care of the calling of God upon my [Music] I made it my business and I told her because of this I'm even intending to be married she didn't quite see it she didn't quite understand it but later on she did and I than God she stood with me they stood with me but listen to me I've since taken care of God's business God sent us over to Ethiopia there are now many churches there I received the text yesterday I posted it on the group group you know the Believers are even going in other areas now they are taking over churches into the message of the hour into the Full Gospel they just baptized the pastor and his and his entire Ministry team theity and and and and you know all these people that are doing these outreaches were directly out of our ministry and my wife my my wife and I and brother Paul in Kenya some other brothers that sacrific

business then I couldn't afford a degree but this time I had not I did not ask anybody to help me I paid it myself I hope you people are catching some re make God his business your business and he will also take care of yours but the people are so much lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God the things of the world make them happy but the things of God bore them and he continues on to say having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof did you hear that or you didn't they are not completely unreligious we are talking about people here who have a form of godl but they don't have the power there power of God is the Holy Spirit the power of God is the word the power of God brings Holiness the power of God makes you submit to the word but these people in our they have a form of godliness but they don't have the power of and he says these are the same kind of people who are like J and jamb they with Moses they resisted the truth they are men of corrupt mind they concerning the [Music] faith let me bring it down here now Jon is UN jumped brother you may not know this let me tell and J were people that we Callos oh the kings men and these men they were serving Pharaoh in Egypt when God told Moses go and do a sign with his Ro he went to Egypt but jice and J could do the same Moses threw down his stick became a snake and they also through their they said that's all you're talking about let us show you two snakes Moses was one there were two so tell me what's the difference but the Bible says these men are over reprobate mind concerning The Truth Listen church it's not about the Miracles it's not about signs and wonders it's about the truth the Bible says you will know the truth and the truth shall the truth at that time was Israel is going out going out of Egypt Jan and jamb was doing signs but they had no truth but here is the news The Serpent of Moses opened its mouth open this mouth and the serpent of J and J were swallowed swallowed swallowed are you hearing me if you believe the truth God is going to vindicate you if you stand for the word don't fear any plan of the enemy against you God will stand with you will fight for you if you are hot and you're not lukewarm the situation may not be very good for you but don't you worry what you have is so powerful what you have is so mighty it will swallow all the poers of Egypt all the Winds of Egypt Hallelujah they were swallow by one of mes and Moses touched it again became a road and he was walking he now did not only have the power of God but all the Winds of Egypt were under him God wants you to to control all the Winds of your family God wants you to control all the Winds of your clown some Believers even fear witchcraft God wants you to go in whereby when you arrive all those sorceries of your family and Clan they begin to vibrate they begin to shake because of your presence why because you have the power of God let me tell you the Bible says there is no divination upon Israel no wish upon why it is all under your faith it is all under your faith they use it to protect them but you have a protector they use it to amen guide them you have a guide the guide is the Holy Ghost they use it to show them what their enemies are doing let me tell you this Holy Ghost he says when he comes he will show you things to come hallelujah it's a power it's a mighty power more Mighty than what the devil has praise God praise God Amen praise God for the first time in all my life I stood before my my uncle the elder brother to my father he's the head of all the Winds of our not only our cran almost the entire region of where I come from and there a great power in this country he is a great power stood before him and I didn't fear I questioned him I looked at him in my eyes and I asked him a question about what he believes so I said so you you you this thing that you you Ser powerful he said oh yes it is powerful there even many pastors who have come here and they have have served them even singers even politicians have been serving them do you also want me to serve and I told him I said look here I don't want you to serve me because I have a higher power and when I said that his eyes began blazing I know then I disorganized these demons and and from that from that time I I saw one of my cousins said an educated young man so I decided to kind of take him to myself I wanted to kind of introduce to him the gospel and I invited him to my home and uh he at first he was forth coming and I told him so do you also serve he said yes I serve I said oh even when you educated he said yeah education does not know these things this is a power I told my brother but I want to meet you because I want to introduce you to my power my power is more mightier than yours and if you meet me you will know what I'm talking about that's the last time I talked to him he never wanted to come near my his powers misled him away but let anybody I don't care what they are involved in let them come under this power let them come under this power I hear some people who say that maybe someone Beed me you is a believer how can you say someone bech as a Believer do you know what they talking about this power we have is higher than witchcraft is stronger than witchcraft the power of Witchcraft can stand before a child of God that is on fire but if you look one you can be praise God it's a revelation it's an understanding look Church praise God J Spirit they all over making Crusades signs and wonders and people are saying this is the truth because there signs that wers there women on the pulpit show me anywhere in the Bible in the Church of the of Pentecost where a woman was a preacher or a Bible teacher nowhere in the Bible that's a larm church I don't care about the signs and wonders J and J could do them even more than what Moses had di they are very busy baptizing babies some of them they have even come to a level where they saying water baptism is not necessary you only need Holy Ghost baptism they are liars they are L they are not according to the Bible but a true church will say what the Bible says what does the Bible say in the book of Acts chapter 2 right there quickly now I want to show you that it says then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost can you say Amen if you believe it how does the Holy Spirit Come I ask again how does the Holy Ghost come what is the first thing repentance what is the second thing water baptism this is the foundation this is the foundation hallelujah amen and when the found is Lay he is going to put a whole plate what is a whole plate the remission of your sins he will wash away all your sin he doesn't matter whether he feel it or not his word says so he will was away all your and then he will put the roofing will put a roofing what is the roofing the Holy Ghost he says you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit but the Liars of today the members and ministers in the lam church what do they say they say you don't need water baptism you don't need repentance all you need is to accept that Jesus died for you what have they done they have simply told you you accept and then they said you don't need to accept if you accept that Jesus died for you then you have to repent of your sins and if you repent of your sins you have to show your faith by your works by being baptized in much water in the name of Jesus Christ what is that it is the foundation of the church the church is a building but what have they done they have taken their foundation and they have kicked it away and then they are still preaching let me ask you a question if they're preaching and they not preaching what the Bible says who sent them who called them where do they get their Authority can can we find out can we find out let me quick pick the scripture right quick here now the Bible says the Devil Himself has made himself the angel of Light second Corinthians chapter 2 11 praise God quickly now this is just an addition for such are false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ chapter read verse 13 [Music] chap those are the false Apostles it doesn't matter whether I call myself apost but if I tell you you don't need water baptism it means I am a false apost if I tell you you don't need to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ then I'm a false Apostle and we have many of them today and they have transformed themselves into the Apostles of Christ and he says no Marvel for sat himself is transformed into the Ang of light therefore if no great thing it is no good thing if his ministers also be transformed as the Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works are you hearing church I wonder whether you are hearing in Jude 1 verse4 for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of God into Las and denying the only Lord God and and our Lord Jesus Christ are you following me Church ask your neighbor are you following praise God these are men how did they come in please listen how did they come onto the pulpit do you not creeping in they came in slowly and then before you knew it praise God praise God who gave you the authority God sent me sent me let us everybody pray pray where are those things in the Bible the Bible says in W people say you're mad but if you speak in Tong let it be interpreted and let it be done in order so they have missed it from the beginning and then they said please join your hands together to welcome our first lady L come Bishop Rebeca is coming Hallelujah God is good let us prepare to pray and in just a second we giving our seed now God is going to bless you Bishop Rea called you to the pit let me tell you your church is not the Church of the Apostles your church the luk Church of we don't have those kind of things in the Bible friends I am not against this church the people I love them I was among them I'm against these wrong systems the systems that are wrong they coming to take people to hell and they don't know as long long as we have a chance we have to say these things time is coming when they will arrest you for saying this but let me tell you we now have a chance to say when I was in Germany brother Pastor told me and I was we with brother Tim the Brut and brother garden and then he said this well he knew I was from Uganda UGA and he wanted me to speak a service so he told me I heard about your uh your law your new law in Uganda I said yes yes so we discussed about it how Uganda hits homosexuality and and how we made a law against it and they all agreed that homosexuality is not right it is a VI Society ra Our Generation with the fear of God and then after we we had our discussion but the God told me but when you take the pulpit don't say anything about this he told me if you do they can close down our church the government we talking about Germany Germany Germany a country that saw the Reformation of the church a country that had a Luther who started the Protestant movement because of Luther we are here God could not have sent the seventh angel messenger without Martin Luther and now in Germany you can't speak against such certain things even if it is in the scriptures to the people publicly that's why I'm saying this we still have a golden opportunity let us preach the way it is let us say the way it is whether people like it or not is the word is the word if is helping us is helping us if I'm speaking about a lukewarm church I cannot be gentle I am performing an operation I have to use sharp objects find yourself pierced maybe I'm piercing something which has to come out Let It Go and accept the right one and then the word of God myself as a spiritual doctor don't you worry after cutting and putting everything I'm going to show you together put you together by the power of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah that's why we have the word praise God and Friends turn away from your ways of just being a high Christian there is no half Christian you just fooling yourself you are either a Christian or a sinner amen as I said you never you never see a drunk sober man you are either drunk or

you don't have to ask anyone for permission to be on fire for God it is your choice if you want to shout in the church it is your choice if you want to clap your hands it is your choice if you want to amen amen roll on the FL your choice and some people would call you a Holy Roller will call you a fanatic are you ashamed of Jesus if Jesus will make you shout then I am not ashamed if Jesus will make

the Holy Spirit and you don't expect to be both you have to choose and the only way you can be right with God Is by being born again tell someone how to be born again Jesus said except a man is born again see the kingdom of no matter what he's done how many Good Deeds he's done to be born again you have to be born again you cannot go in by your good works your works and nothing before you have to

now me the Holy Spirit comes into your heart [Music] and when when he comes he starts a certain work in your life he begins to convince you while he's brooding over you and he convicts your heart and shows you every sin in your and you begin to feel how sinful you are oh God oh God I'm a sinner I don't deserve your grace that's a conviction and do you know what it does it brings hatred in your heart to that sin if you're telling lies if you're living immorally stealing if you are you know into these things of the world he begins to conv you to brood over you and reveal these things to I've seen people literally in the church removing earrings never wearing them again yet I did not talk about it at all what was that was the Holy Spirit making it real to them bringing them from the level of coldness putting a fire within their hearts for God and you begin to H sin you get a new mind you get a new resolve you get you know a power and and that is the power that overcomes the world if you are tied up with these things in this sinful life you don't need to be told to leave it if I tell you to leave it you will leave it but you are not saved salvation I wish you comes by ation a conviction comes by hearing the word when you hear the and the Holy Spirit comes down he begins to brood over you and you feel a that's where many people you see they begin to cry you know helplessly helplessly they don't care about anything they in that presence the Holy Spirit shows them the the brutal nature of the sin is capturing them the holy spirit makes it real to you you don't need any more to walk as a l one believer he reveals to you what that sin is going to do to you he creates in you a hatred for that sin you begin to have you know you begin to Lo it to despise it and then you are left helpless you're like oh what am I going to do one time happened to Isaiah said God I'm a man of uncan he did not say God if I have unle lips me he knew by a conviction of the when he came before God God told him what nature of man he was like that man that saw you know was he went before God and when he reached there that milky presence of the Holy Ghost he says even the little sin he had done lie he had told it was all big and magnified in the presence of that light that light can come here right now and when it does that's the conviction you need you will not cry because of emotion you will not weep because of emotion but it will be out of a conviction say oh God I'm a sinner I'm a man of unclean lips he says I am undone when that happens to you it's like God giving you judgment it's like as if youve already gone to hell I'm my Cas is already judged you know what the feeling it is to be before a judge of the highest court and that after him there is no other court that's how you will feel you feel like I've sin I'm undone I'm finished and when the prophet felt that way prophet Isaiah cried out he said I'm oh God and he was helpless he became completely helpless but in that presence that's where God wants all of us to go you see no matter what you you're doing in your life God wants you to come to that conv many people when they caught doing something wrong they begin to apologize I'm sorry but after that they continue doing because they did not have a conviction and if you don't have a conviction you canot be saved even if you do the good things what we need church is a conviction when you receive that conviction in it's a genuine repentance the Holy Spirit reveals to you everything you have done you don't come to him and say Lord if I have done Lord here is what I've done I'm a liar I'm a thief forgive me wash me me make me and you it will bring through repentance repentance means you turn away from your sin you cannot go back to it why because when you truly repent you receive the Holy Spirit your soul now that Holy Spirit is a power that controls you and pulls you away from sin each time you want to tell a lie he will zip your mouth uh selfcontrol comes from the Holy Spirit see this is what we need because because we do not have a a genuine conviction we have a lot of loc Believers can we please stand on our feet God when you are saved God gives you Faith to rise from The Mark of the earth your faith overcomes the things of the world what is your faith your faith in that act that God has did in you in you in you what God to make you a Son of God listen you quit your lying you quit your stealing you quit your drinking because your faith Rises up above it if you don't do it you you don't have anything if you don't quit these things you don't have anything and by faith you are saved through [Music] Grace brother Peter we're going to sing a song which says let the washers arise and I'll read this last portion listen as much as your faith will be released as much as your faith will be released released that's how much power you can [Music] have because in you dwells the power to make heavens and earth my wife told
