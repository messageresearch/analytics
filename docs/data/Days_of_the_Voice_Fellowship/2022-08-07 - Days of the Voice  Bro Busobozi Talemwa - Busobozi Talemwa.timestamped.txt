[50:19] there was a request no brother you have
[50:21] to put the wallpaper
[50:37] i want to say we appreciate all these
[50:39] brothers
[50:42] could not even
[50:43] walk very well last night
[50:49] was always finding time to come through
[51:07] and there are many others
[51:09] who also had something that they did
[51:13] you know by the shame who kind of shame
[51:16] but the shame was always around to make
[51:18] sure people have eaten some time
[51:20] organization
[51:34] uh
[51:36] you know and i don't know who i have
[51:38] forgotten that was really here all
[51:40] throughout
[51:41] everything
[51:45] rather brilliant
[51:46] oh yeah all right brother also
[51:50] [Music]
[52:01] so god has been so good to us
[52:05] um i do not have all the details i would
[52:07] have wanted to give you this morning
[52:13] so i will need to maybe save that for
[52:15] next sunday
[52:26] we felt
[52:28] we felt that we have to do it this way
[52:30] why would it take
[52:32] in song
[52:34] so we've spent money
[52:38] a lot of money ninja no teller which we
[52:41] all including you are yet to pay
[52:43] seniors
[52:49] and uh
[52:50] like i said i don't have all the details
[52:52] and i would not want to give you the
[52:53] half details
[53:10] maybe what i can say is i want to
[53:11] appreciate those who have
[53:13] cleared off their pledges that they made
[53:15] what's the rental for this place
[53:23] a total of 1.5
[53:25] million was paid uh
[53:30] of the 2.5 which was uh
[53:33] pledged
[53:36] and one million is due for payments
[53:57] i believe in worshipping god in spirit
[53:59] and in truth
[54:02] but i also believe in worshiping him in
[54:04] a good environment
[54:06] [Music]
[54:21] and i have a little heaven down here
[54:26] is one it should be portraying where i
[54:29] am going when the one you know
[54:33] so if someone can't if i bring someone
[54:35] to church
[54:49] they wouldn't really believe they would
[54:52] i believe they would not understand that
[54:54] the place i'm taking them to or that i'm
[54:56] promising them that the bible the word
[54:58] of god is promising them is really real
[55:01] to watch
[55:04] this
[55:14] you know you found there was a a a
[55:16] another young man preaching
[55:57] [Music]
[55:58] that prosperity is not a sign that god
[56:01] has favored you
[56:05] but i believe that children of god must
[56:07] not live in this in a sort of state
[56:15] because we worship a god who is more
[56:17] than enough for sins
[56:19] every single one how many believe that
[56:22] you see what he has given you is not
[56:24] enough he's going to give you more
[56:28] and what he has done for us is not
[56:29] enough he's going to bring more
[56:32] towards it
[56:34] i want to say this is just the beginning
[56:35] they're going to come back to academy in
[56:37] dc
[56:38] are there going to be battles whenever i
[56:40] went yes of course
[56:55] we are not blind
[56:57] we are not blind the truth is
[56:59] i can see
[57:01] and i know for sure
[57:03] the lord will call that on their tree is
[57:05] more than faithful
[57:08] i will lead us all the
[57:10] way the only thing he's requesting us to
[57:13] do to catch up
[57:15] is to trust him
[57:19] praise the lord
[57:21] coming out before i go into the
[57:22] preaching
[57:23] again i would like us to stand
[57:37] your spiritual thermometer might be low
[57:39] now
[57:44] i'd like you to stand
[57:45] again and i would like us to sing a
[57:47] worship song brother
[57:50] brother brilliant to him
[57:52] and i'd like us to enter into a little
[57:54] worship to english
[57:56] for just a moment
[58:00] hallelujah hallelujah and i'd like you
[58:02] to do it with all your hearts

[1:30:43] yeah let me tell you when he asked a
[1:30:46] question
[1:30:48] and the question
[1:30:49] took us to revelation 10.
[1:30:54] and
[1:30:55] i was still
[1:30:57] busy speaking with the brothers
[1:31:01] and so
[1:31:02] i asked her brother isaac to take him
[1:31:04] through revelation 10.
[1:31:10] so you're missing the whole story now
[1:31:13] i asked by the isaac to check
[1:31:15] through the other young man through
[1:31:17] revelation 10.
[1:31:24] and i was amazed at how much he knew of
[1:31:26] the scriptures
[1:31:30] and so as i heard them talk i i got an
[1:31:34] inspiration to speak on this this
[1:31:35] morning
[1:31:50] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:31:51] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:31:54] sound the mystery of god should be
[1:31:56] finished as he has declared unto his
[1:31:59] servants the prophets
[1:32:10] foreign
[1:32:21] praise the lord
[1:32:39] before i forget on thursday the lord
[1:32:41] willing i will be traveling to karamoja
[1:32:49] sadly we lost one of the translators
[1:33:18] so he was brought to malaga for
[1:33:25] when i understood that he was in a
[1:33:28] critical condition i asked i was trying
[1:33:30] to find out if another brother could be
[1:33:32] able to take up his responsibility and
[1:33:34] complete those
[1:33:48] underwent the operation but
[1:33:50] while he was on the hospital bed
[1:33:55] i talked to him
[1:33:57] after his operation
[1:34:00] he told me please do not give those
[1:34:02] chapters to anyone
[1:34:04] i want to translate them myself
[1:34:10] and uh
[1:34:12] i said okay but you have strength enough
[1:34:30] several messages which others have done
[1:34:36] a work that he has never done before the
[1:34:38] quantity of work he did i was actually
[1:34:40] even impressed i was about to call him
[1:34:42] and ask him how did you do all this
[1:34:44] yakuza
[1:35:01] so he asked one of the people uh
[1:35:03] brothers to take him to the hospital
[1:35:07] um and
[1:35:09] while there that very morning he passed
[1:35:11] away
[1:35:26] give those two last chapters to someone
[1:35:28] else
[1:35:29] in front yes sooner says the same by
[1:35:31] your side

[1:36:04] uh
[1:36:04] next week which will be on thursday
[1:36:08] [Music]
[1:36:35] [Music]

[1:37:41] moreover teaching
[1:37:46] i'm not a good teacher
[1:37:49] although some think i am yeah
[1:37:53] but my uh
[1:37:55] gift usually runs into preaching
[1:38:00] but i pray that things will be said
[1:38:02] today which will help you and help all
[1:38:03] of us to get deeper into the knowledge
[1:38:05] of the world
[1:38:07] [Music]
[1:38:12] so that you can be at the fight
[1:38:51] you know sometimes i realize when the
[1:38:53] preacher is not preaching and but
[1:38:54] teaching getting into
[1:38:56] people
[1:39:02] [Music]
[1:39:25] what i'm speaking on our church is
[1:39:27] called days of the voice fellowship hey
[1:39:28] can you say that
[1:39:30] what days of the voice fellowship and
[1:39:33] i think the verse we have read today is
[1:39:35] the reason why
[1:39:38] you know
[1:39:51] the days of the voice
[1:39:56] now
[1:39:57] we have read the verse
[1:40:00] it says but in the days of the voice
[1:40:04] that doubles
[1:41:01] we need to hear the voice
[1:41:04] because without that it doesn't matter
[1:41:07] we are blind
[1:41:09] but we do not know
[1:41:10] man
[1:41:12] praise the name of the lord how many of
[1:41:13] us
[1:41:14] the worst situation that has ever
[1:41:45] bible disciple which we call the torah
[1:41:47] the twitter torah the old testament in
[1:41:49] the name and they would read out of the
[1:41:51] book of isaiah and others
[1:41:58] a son is
[1:43:08] because they were not
[1:43:10] sensitive to the spiritual things
[1:43:13] [Music]
[1:43:16] they were blind but they did not know
[1:43:22] and he told
[1:43:50] and the promise was given to the seed of
[1:43:53] abraham next tuesday when saturday i
[1:43:55] believe and we are the seed of abraham
[1:43:58] you can't curse us
[1:44:01] whoever you counted that is blessed
[1:44:04] you're not calling
[1:44:13] the promise was not to the natural seed
[1:44:16] of abraham only
[1:44:46] the seed of the woman
[1:44:49] and when he appeared on earth
[1:44:51] he was the one supposed to possess the
[1:44:53] gate of his enemies
[1:44:57] and that is why
[1:45:00] jesus the head of the serpent yes we are
[1:45:03] written into mutual minister but no
[1:45:05] other could tell him
[1:45:07] how could jesus even do that yes yes
[1:45:10] because it was the sea that was promised
[1:45:12] to come
[1:45:16] [Music]
[1:46:07] there is a group of people that you will
[1:46:09] never be blinded why do achieving
[1:46:35] comes by the voice

[1:47:02] the picture because i want you to
[1:47:04] prepare to show it

[1:57:55] little by little
[1:57:58] people
[1:58:02] we can understand the mystery of god
[1:58:10] and at that time shall michael stand up
[1:58:13] the great priests which stand for the
[1:58:15] children of thy people and there shall
[1:58:17] be a time of trouble such as never worse
[1:58:19] since there was a nation even to that
[1:58:21] same time and at that time thy people
[1:58:23] shall be delivered every one that shall
[1:58:25] be found written in the book
[1:58:32] of
[1:58:35] [Music]
[1:58:44] okay
[1:59:01] church daniel was a prophet of god then
[1:59:03] he'd be hearing that you are catholic
[1:59:05] one of the great and major prophets
[1:59:07] in the world
[1:59:11] and daniel at the time when they were
[1:59:14] not in their
[1:59:23] during i think the reign of uh
[1:59:26] um
[1:59:27] of uh
[1:59:29] i don't remember the king probably the
[1:59:30] king of kazakhstan wherever he was
[1:59:34] daniel daniel
[1:59:36] was so much constrained in his heart
[1:59:41] to pray
[2:00:36] but it would only be for 70 years
[2:01:07] nothing could see now praying
[2:01:10] for the sins of his people
[2:01:12] repenting for them
[2:01:15] god remember themselves
[2:02:29] that you can be there listen to
[2:02:43] the revelation and
[2:04:22] gave him a timeline
[2:04:25] from the beginning
[2:04:27] to the end
[2:04:32] and now here in chapter 12
[2:04:36] he received a a revelation
[2:04:41] about
[2:04:42] what would happen in the future
[2:04:46] now you need to understand that israel
[2:04:49] god deals with israel as a country
[2:04:56] [Music]
[2:05:09] [Music]
[2:05:46] israel
[2:05:47] is
[2:05:48] given an allotment of time yes
[2:05:55] and that time was 70 weeks of yes
[2:06:03] right now seven years
[2:06:05] a one week weekend is uh uh equal to
[2:06:09] seven years
[2:06:14] yes seven years here comes sam so we
[2:06:17] noticed that
[2:06:20] excuse me now
[2:06:21] we noticed that that time of the jewels
[2:06:27] was to
[2:06:35] [Music]
[2:06:39] but the messiah jesus christ
[2:06:42] by the time he came we had cheetah and
[2:06:45] he started this ministry
[2:06:48] he's
[2:06:49] the weak because remember god was still
[2:06:50] with the jews
[2:06:54] are you following me
[2:06:55] and the time of the dude was still
[2:06:57] counting
[2:07:01] continuing ending finishing
[2:07:05] but there was also a prophecy
[2:07:08] will not be that the messiah would be
[2:07:10] cut off
[2:07:25] and when the messiah
[2:07:27] is cut off
[2:07:30] then the times of the jews would be put
[2:07:32] to a point
[2:07:35] where you die at this occasion
[2:07:38] at a time of the gentiles would come in
[2:07:43] they turn the kid out also for a space
[2:07:45] of time
[2:07:49] until
[2:07:51] fulfillment has come
[2:07:57] when the time of the gentiles has been
[2:07:59] fulfilled
[2:08:02] god would go back to israel
[2:08:22] when jesus came on earth and he preached
[2:08:24] his ministry for three hours and a half
[2:08:25] and she said yes
[2:08:29] that was the first part of the last week
[2:08:33] of the jewish time
[2:08:42] and it was a half of the last week
[2:08:47] a week a symbiote
[2:09:10] so if you do not like math in school oh
[2:09:12] today is not going to get a good service
[2:09:16] [Music]
[2:09:44] the week of the of the gregorian and all
[2:09:47] that kind of things
[2:09:50] so now i'm teaching a different man
[2:09:54] those who are doing math in school don't
[2:09:56] go and say one week in seven years
[2:10:11] but here i mean i'm talking about
[2:10:13] something else
[2:10:15] to tell your neighbor one week is seven
[2:10:17] years
[2:10:20] now jesus yes his ministry was for how
[2:10:24] long but where is
[2:10:41] right
[2:10:42] mean and when jesus was cut off cut yes
[2:10:46] when you said he were by the death by
[2:10:48] them the truth killing him on the cross
[2:10:52] he denied him
[2:10:54] they
[2:11:21] [Applause]
[2:11:38] amen that's why we say we are children
[2:11:40] of abraham by promise
[2:11:46] whatever israel can claim we too can
[2:11:48] claim
[2:12:14] and now you see that brought in the
[2:12:16] gentle charge
[2:12:18] give me a child
[2:13:41] well of course they were churches in
[2:15:06] the time of the end
[2:15:08] at the time of the end
[2:15:11] and we are here and after tuesday we are
[2:15:13] the time of the end of church i'm coming
[2:15:15] end of the ceiling of the mystery and
[2:15:18] comedy
[2:15:28] [Music]

[2:15:52] you want
[2:15:52] to face for the jews
[2:15:57] no rachel that's that time
[2:16:00] will start counting again
[2:16:57] i don't think they're going to hold it
[2:16:58] forever

[2:18:02] [Applause]
[2:18:22] that is going to be a really fierce time
[2:18:28] it's going to be the time when the
[2:18:29] angels will let go

[2:24:26] beginning of the creation which god
[2:24:28] created unto this time
