[32:15] you.
[32:19] As long as
[32:21] [singing and music]
[32:24] I
[32:26] [music]
[32:26] brea,
[32:29] I will
[32:32] [singing] always
[32:35] [music]
[32:39] [singing]
[32:40] beside you.
[32:44] I [singing]
[32:45] will
[32:46] [music]
[32:47] be silence.
[32:50] [singing]
[32:52] I will [music]
[32:54] always
[32:57] worship
[33:00] you. [music]
[33:02] How long are you
[33:05] as long [singing]
[33:06] as I am? [music]
[33:14] I will
[33:16] always
[33:19] worship [singing and music]
[33:21] you.
[33:24] [music]
[33:27] Hallelujah.
[33:29] Thank you.
[33:37] Worship him
[33:39] with your lifted up hand and [music]
[33:41] speak to him tonight.
[33:44] It's a night of worship. It's a night
[33:49] of prayer.
[33:51] How many just need the Lord to just come
[33:53] and minister to them tonight?
[33:55] [music]
[33:58] Would you please
[34:00] just now begin to enter into my
[34:02] presence?
[34:06] Nothing else matters
[34:09] but his presence.
[34:12] If only we can be able to enter into
[34:14] that presence,
[34:17] then all things become possible.
[34:22] Our desires committing them to him.
[34:27] Our needs committing them to him.
[34:33] You know, the most dangerous thing is to
[34:36] to have religion but have no Christ.
[34:44] You can be able to go to church.
[34:47] The devil can let you do that.
[34:50] You can be able to sing.
[34:53] The devil may not hinder you.
[34:56] But entering into his presence
[35:00] is one thing. the devil would try his
[35:02] best
[35:05] to hinder you
[35:08] to stop you.
[35:11] So whenever you have a moment like this
[35:15] when you are not at your home,
[35:18] you've not come, we've not come here to
[35:19] see one another.
[35:22] We have come because we have a hunger
[35:25] and a thirst for
[35:28] to hear from a living God.
[35:31] have contact with him
[35:34] that he may speak to us and we may hear
[35:37] from him and we may tell him our hearts
[35:40] and
[35:42] so when you come in his presence
[35:46] walk into that shakina glor [snorts]
[35:50] and the reason why we sing
[35:53] is to draw his presence
[35:58] that he may come.
[36:01] See when his presence [music] comes down
[36:05] then we are bound to hear from him.
[36:09] When the word comes in such a presence
[36:13] in such an atmosphere
[36:16] there's nothing that is impossible
[36:20] because he has come down.
[36:23] Would you now close your eyes
[36:27] for just a moment
[36:30] and begin to connect with him,
[36:33] the Holy Spirit,
[36:37] let him draw nigh unto thee
[36:40] as you draw nigh unto him.
[36:44] Brother Shalom, I wonder if you can help
[36:45] us sing that song, draw me, Lord. Draw
[36:47] me, Lord.
[36:51] There's a run after thee.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Draw
[36:58] me
[37:00] Lord.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Let us sing this song from our hearts if
[37:03] we can.

[46:21] Lord, we have no other desire. But Lord,
[46:24] our desire is that you may come into our
[46:26] heart. Father, you may not only come to
[46:29] visit us, but you will come to stay. You
[46:31] come to accomplish your work which you
[46:33] have started in our lives. We are not
[46:35] here by accident, but we are here by
[46:37] design. You knew us and chose us in you
[46:40] before the foundation of the world. And
[46:42] Lord, we are here to be made manifest.
[46:44] We are here, Lord, to be unveiled to the
[46:46] world and to overcome whatsoever the
[46:49] enemy brings our way. Now Lord as we
[46:51] yield ourselves to you tonight Lord yet
[46:53] again for another moment another session
[46:55] where you'll come and bring your word of
[46:57] life father Lord may you touch each and
[47:00] every part of our lives tonight. May
[47:03] your word oh God of glory be a revival

[47:10] within us as he ministered as he spoke

[47:14] prayer in the precious name of our Lord
[47:16] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[47:21] The Lord bless you saints good evening.

[47:28] evening.
[47:32] Nice to see those of you who uh have
[47:34] finally made it tonight.
[47:38] It's usually a blessing to be in his
[47:39] presence.
[47:43] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[47:47] Praise the Lord.
[47:49] I don't want you to be absent minded.
[47:53] When I'm speaking, I'm speaking to you
[47:57] each of you, not you as a group. The
[48:01] Lord is speaking to you.
[48:04] Praise the Lord.
[48:06] Amen. Amen. Let us turn to the book of
[48:09] Numbers, chapter 13.
[48:24] We'll read from verses 26.
[48:36] To those in the media department, this
[48:37] is just a continuation of what we've
[48:39] been talking about.
[48:45] Just pay attention to the verses.
[48:51] We're reading from 26 to 33.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Uh brother, maybe we'll try to read
[48:57] verse by verse. We see how it will go.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they went and came to Moses
[49:01] and to Aaron, and to all the
[49:02] congregation of the children of Israel,
[49:04] unto the wilderness of Peron, to Kadesh,
[49:07] and brought back word unto them, and
[49:10] unto all the congregation, and showed
[49:11] them the fruit of the land.
[49:28] And they told him and said, "We we came
[49:32] unto the land whether thou sentest
[49:35] sentest us, and surely it flowth with
[49:38] milk and honey, and this is the fruit of
[49:41] it.
[49:53] Nevertheless, the people be strong that
[49:56] dwell in the land, and the cities are w
[49:59] and very great. And moreover, we saw the
[50:01] children of Anak there. The Amalachites
[50:04] dwell in the land of the south, and the
[50:06] Hittites, and the Jebsites, and the
[50:08] Amorites dwell in the mountains, and the
[50:10] Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the
[50:13] coast of Jordan.
[50:38] And steal the people before Moses and
[50:40] said, "Let us go up at once and possess
[50:43] it, for we are able to overcome it.
[50:58] But the men that went up with him said,
[51:00] "We be not able to go up against the
[51:02] people, for they are stronger than we."
[51:04] And they brought up an evil report of
[51:06] the land which they had searched unto
[51:09] the children of Israel, saying, "The
[51:10] land through which we have been uh we
[51:13] have gone to search it is a land that
[51:15] eatth up the inhabitants thereof, and
[51:17] all the people that we saw in it, a man
[51:19] of a great stature.
[51:32] Baby,
[52:02] And there we saw giants, the son of an
[52:04] sons of Anch which come of the giants
[52:07] and were in our own sight as
[52:10] grasshoppers. And so we were in their
[52:13] sight.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Father, we have read a
[52:16] portion of your word tonight. We ask
[52:17] your grace once again
[52:22] as we take a few moments to speak Lord
[52:24] on this word.
[52:28] reveal it to us. May your Holy Spirit
[52:30] come and help us that these will not
[52:33] just be words written
[52:37] but your spirit will be applied upon
[52:39] them
[52:40] and that you will accomplish your work
[52:42] in our lives
[52:44] for myself to everyone here Lord
[52:48] and the interpreter as well. Help each
[52:51] of us Lord that are streaming by the way
[52:54] of the internet.
[52:56] May you just minister to each one Lord
[52:58] in Jesus mighty name. Amen. Amen.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. You may be seated.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Um
[53:08] to those of you streaming and you're
[53:10] supposed to be here.
[53:16] Just want to always encourage you to
[53:17] come to church
[53:20] whenever you can. And those of you who
[53:23] are here, tell your neighbor, God bless
[53:26] you.
[53:27] Thank you for coming to church.
[53:30] Amen. Some people are not hearing what
[53:33] I'm saying.
[53:35] Touch your neighbor and just tell them,
[53:40] you know, don't be timid.
[53:42] Where the spirit of God is, there is
[53:44] liberty.
[53:47] Yes.
[53:50] So uh before we go into the word
[53:52] tonight, I just wanted to say pastor
[53:53] Simon Cay is arriving tonight.
[54:00] Um he he he must be still flying as I
[54:02] I'm speaking to you now.
[54:05] And uh you know this is someone who has
[54:08] really sacrificed a lot to come
[54:13] all the way from New York.
[54:15] He's a pastor there.
[54:18] And so he's mainly coming for Karamoj as
[54:21] I told you on Sunday.
[54:26] So he's arriving tonight
[54:29] and then tomorrow early in the morning.
[54:33] We will be uh starting the the road trip
[54:38] for
[54:41] this convention is in Cot this year.
[54:44] And so uh we are trying to make it try
[54:50] to see if we will make it possible to
[54:52] stream the service.
[54:59] So brother is is going with us as well
[55:05] and you so pray it will be possible.
[55:06] Sometimes you want to do it but it
[55:08] depends on the equipment that they have
[55:10] there and all that.
[55:15] But uh those of you who if we if it is
[55:18] possible to stream
[55:21] then you will you try to tune in because
[55:24] I want you to hear for yourself because
[55:26] I told you oh brother sister has a good
[55:28] ministry.
[55:33] So when if you hear then you will know
[55:36] what I was saying.
[55:38] So after we're going to be there
[55:40] throughout the weekend.
[55:44] Um, and then we'll be here. So before he
[55:47] flies away, I think on could be on the
[55:49] same day we'll try to have him on on a
[55:50] Wednesday,
[55:55] the Lord willing. So would you remember
[55:57] that in prayer?
[55:59] Amen. And there are many traveling as
[56:00] well and many traveling back and others
[56:02] traveling back.
[56:04] So we should also remember brother
[56:07] uh
[56:10] brother Brian
[56:11] Sometimes the names keep my mind.
[56:14] Brother Brian is going to be traveling
[56:16] to his in-laws. Brian,
[56:20] &gt;&gt; I just thought I should I should make
[56:21] that public.
[56:24] So, as a church, I'd like us to remember
[56:25] him in prayer
[56:27] that God will give him traveling masses
[56:30] and also give him favor before their
[56:31] eyes.
[56:34] Amen. And also we we have this
[56:37] convention that has been always
[56:38] organized in the in in the uh Buganda
[56:45] Masaka sub region
[56:53] and I um I don't so they called me up
[56:57] and wanted us to send one of our
[57:00] ministers here
[57:03] and they specifically wanted brother
[57:05] brother Julius to go and and help.
[57:09] You know they usually just invite young
[57:12] ministers to minister to young people.
[57:17] They thought that brother brother Julius
[57:19] would bless them.
[57:22] So we as a church want to stand behind
[57:24] that and
[57:28] send him down there
[57:30] willing he might go with brother shalom.
[57:34] Shalom.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; So it will be on the
[57:38] 18th. Uh no I think is it 29th
[57:43] through the new year.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So that is going to be uh 29,
[57:51] 30th, 31st
[57:54] through the new year fast.
[57:57] They'll be back on on the second
[58:01] and then of course that following Sunday
[58:02] we have brother Michael here.
[58:07] It's a busy season
[58:09] but we are going to be enjoying a lot of
[58:11] ministry.
[58:13] Let us try to not miss any service.
[58:18] Amen.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; So tonight we are just going to continue
[58:22] and I I promised that I would speak a
[58:24] little bit on Kadesh Beradesh.
[58:29] How many know what Kadesh ban is?
[58:34] All right. So now we've been following
[58:36] the story.
[58:39] Very interesting story.
[58:41] For a while now we've been talking about
[58:43] the journey of of the Israelites.
[58:47] as you know going to the promised land
[58:51] and mainly our subject has been talking
[58:53] about vision
[58:57] and when we talk about vision
[59:00] you know we've been trying to take
[59:02] vision and connect it to the will of God
[59:09] season and the time because when God
[59:12] wants to you know do something
[59:16] I remember when we first talked about
[59:17] this subject,
[59:19] we read Amos 3:7
[59:22] that surely the Lord will do nothing
[59:25] but he reveals his secrets to his
[59:26] servants, the prophets.
[59:29] If God wants to do something in any age
[59:32] or season,
[59:35] what he does is he picks a man
[59:38] and then he gives him a mission.
[59:42] He sends him out. But this man is only
[59:45] going to carry out the vision.
[59:50] His mission or his assignment
[59:53] would be to accomplish the vision.
[59:56] So in other words, we can call him the
[59:58] vision bearer.
[1:00:01] So the vision bearer
[1:00:04] is the one that has the understanding of
[1:00:07] the will of God for that season.
[1:00:12] Not meaning that the spirit of God
[1:00:13] cannot come upon others.
[1:00:17] He can, but in a specific way.
[1:00:21] He gives this man that he has chosen or
[1:00:23] picked up
[1:00:25] the woman or whatever it is. And then he
[1:00:27] anoints them with the word of the hour.
[1:00:32] He anoints them with the word of the
[1:00:35] season.
[1:00:37] And he this man or this woman would be
[1:00:39] would then be the vision bearer.
[1:00:43] OF THE VISION OF God for that season for
[1:00:47] that group of people and if anyone comes
[1:00:50] against them
[1:00:53] they will be out of the will of God
[1:00:56] and so we've taken it in different
[1:00:58] directions
[1:01:00] and we talked about a church a local
[1:01:03] church like this one how God lifts up a
[1:01:06] man called a pastor and you know we've
[1:01:09] talked about you know as each of us as
[1:01:12] individuals how we must choose which
[1:01:14] church we attend.
[1:01:18] We are given the liberty to do that.
[1:01:21] And how when you have chosen a church
[1:01:23] where you're going to be uh um uh as
[1:01:26] your home church,
[1:01:29] then you must 100%,
[1:01:32] let me put it this way, 200%
[1:01:36] believe in the vision of that pastor OF
[1:01:38] THAT CHURCH.
[1:01:41] AND WE SAID IF you don't it's time to
[1:01:44] find another church
[1:01:46] because that pastor if you don't believe
[1:01:49] in him he cannot do anything for you
[1:01:51] spiritually
[1:01:54] and also you cannot be helped.
[1:01:58] So then you must have confidence
[1:02:01] in that man and then God will use him
[1:02:05] for your spiritual life. And I read you
[1:02:08] a quote where brother Bham said he is
[1:02:11] ordained of God
[1:02:13] to lead you through.
[1:02:17] Now it does not mean that that man will
[1:02:18] be perfect.
[1:02:21] But you still leave his imperfections to
[1:02:23] God.
[1:02:25] And if you believe he's a man of God for
[1:02:27] you
[1:02:29] then you believe in his leadership.
[1:02:32] You believe in his guidance. You believe
[1:02:34] in his teaching.
[1:02:36] And in this life, God will use him to
[1:02:38] lead you.
[1:02:41] Praise the name of the Lord. This is the
[1:02:44] message of the hour. And now we also
[1:02:47] talked about the man of God for a
[1:02:49] generation.
[1:02:52] Because you see a pastor, we have many
[1:02:54] pastors.
[1:02:56] And every pastor is sent to a local
[1:02:57] assembly.
[1:03:00] And every pastor must have an
[1:03:01] assignment.
[1:03:03] You must have a vision for that local
[1:03:06] work,
[1:03:08] for that local vision, for that local
[1:03:09] area,
[1:03:11] you know. And and and and so God does
[1:03:14] that.
[1:03:15] You know you cannot assign somebody.
[1:03:19] God cannot assign somebody
[1:03:21] to go out without giving him a vision.
[1:03:26] But in the same way we also realize
[1:03:30] thank you brother Enoch. So we also
[1:03:32] realize that God will send a prophet in
[1:03:36] a generation.
[1:03:39] In the same way you know you cannot
[1:03:42] raise up two people three or four
[1:03:47] in the church and he gives them the
[1:03:49] vision for the church.
[1:03:52] That's why brother Bham completely
[1:03:54] asserts
[1:03:56] that the church is not led by a board of
[1:03:59] directors
[1:04:02] or it's not even led by a board of
[1:04:03] deacons
[1:04:06] but it is led
[1:04:08] by the Holy Spirit and the word and God
[1:04:13] places that man there
[1:04:17] and he inspires him. He he he guides him
[1:04:22] using the word and the Holy Spirit and
[1:04:26] then he uses that
[1:04:28] lead us as a congregation.
[1:04:31] I'm not amazed how God does things.
[1:04:35] But then also in a generation,
[1:04:38] God has not raised up a a a A A BOARD OF
[1:04:42] pastors
[1:04:44] or a school of prophets
[1:04:47] that each of them will bring their
[1:04:49] opinion
[1:04:51] and the body of Christ will be led.
[1:04:55] The vision OF A GENERATION,
[1:04:58] GOD GIVES it to one man
[1:05:01] called a prophet,
[1:05:03] the prophet. of the age. And the prophet
[1:05:07] of the age is a vision bearer.
[1:05:11] Listen, you need to understand this and
[1:05:13] I I'll continue with this subject until
[1:05:15] we all catch it.
[1:05:19] Just like IN THE LOCAL CHURCH
[1:05:21] WHERE the pastor is the vision bearer,
[1:05:25] BUT HE'S NOT the only minister.
[1:05:28] You see, in the local church, YOU WILL
[1:05:31] HAVE THE five-fold ministry.
[1:05:34] All of it may not be in one local church
[1:05:36] but it's in the body of Christ anyway.
[1:05:39] What I'm saying in a local church you
[1:05:42] have teachers you have you know apostles
[1:05:45] you have you know evangelists you have
[1:05:47] but also you have the nine spiritual
[1:05:49] gifts
[1:05:51] and all these are ministering to the
[1:05:53] body.
[1:05:56] But in a local body like here like DVA
[1:05:58] for example,
[1:06:00] you have one pastor that God has chosen
[1:06:04] and given the vision
[1:06:07] for that local body
[1:06:10] and and and and you know but there are
[1:06:12] also other ministers.
[1:06:15] But you see those ministers
[1:06:18] should not come in another spirit
[1:06:22] or in another vision.
[1:06:25] Do you understand? They have to MINISTER
[1:06:27] IN THE SAME SAME VISION.
[1:06:30] That's why you must never if you're a
[1:06:32] preacher,
[1:06:33] you must never submit yourself to a
[1:06:35] ministry,
[1:06:38] to a local MINISTRY
[1:06:40] WHERE YOU DON'T understand the vision of
[1:06:42] that man.
[1:06:45] You see, that's why we have a lot of
[1:06:47] political maneuvers
[1:06:49] IN CHURCHES.
[1:06:51] YOU FIND THEM, YOU KNOW, FIGHTING AND
[1:06:53] one will come and put will say this,
[1:06:56] another one will come and say this,
[1:06:58] ANOTHER ONE WILL SAY THIS. So they
[1:07:00] leading the church INTO LIKE 10
[1:07:02] DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.
[1:07:06] And that kind OF CHURCH WILL ALWAYS BE
[1:07:07] CONFUSED.
[1:07:11] PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS FIGHT. THERE WILL
[1:07:14] ALWAYS BE DISAGREEMENTS.
[1:07:16] THERE WILL ALWAYS BE GOSSIP. THERE WILL
[1:07:18] ALWAYS BE MISUNDERSTANDINGS.
[1:07:20] BUT THEN THE VISION IS LOST.
[1:07:24] BUT YOU SEE A CHURCH THAT IS GROWING
[1:07:27] that is proceeding
[1:07:29] in the vision OF THE AGE
[1:07:32] OR IN THE VISION THAT God has given
[1:07:33] them. YOU WILL FIND THAT THEY WILL ALL
[1:07:36] DESIRE TO KNOW WHAT IS the vision that
[1:07:39] God has given to our pastor.
[1:07:44] WHAT IS HE TEACHING?
[1:07:47] WHAT YOU MUST KNOW WHAT your pastor
[1:07:48] believes on every subject.
[1:07:53] What does he believe on women hair?
[1:07:57] Does he is he okay with women cutting
[1:07:59] THEIR HAIR?
[1:08:01] WHAT DOES he believe on dressing? WHAT
[1:08:04] DOES HE BELIEVE ON WATER BAPTISM? WHAT
[1:08:07] DOES HE BELIEVE ON THE GOHEAD? WHAT does
[1:08:09] he believe ON THE SEVEN? WHAT DOES HE
[1:08:11] BELIEVE? YOU MUST KNOW. YOU MUST KNOW.
[1:08:14] DON'T FOLLOW BLINDLY.
[1:08:17] THE PROBLEM PEOPLE ARE ARE replacing the
[1:08:20] word with religion, the spirit with
[1:08:22] RELIGION
[1:08:25] AND THEY GET STUCK. THAT'S WHY PEOPLE
[1:08:27] CAN FOLLOW ANYTHING.
[1:08:30] DON'T FOLLOW ANYTHING.
[1:08:32] KNOW WHAT YOU BELIEVE. KNOW WHAT YOU ARE
[1:08:35] YOU ARE STANDING WITH. KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
[1:08:38] STANDING BEHIND.
[1:08:39] Because if he that is leading you IS
[1:08:42] BLIND.
[1:08:45] Even you even if you think you are
[1:08:47] seeing you are blind.
[1:08:50] The Bible says the BLIND LEADING THE
[1:08:52] BLIND THEY ALL BOTH fall where? Into the
[1:08:54] deep.
[1:08:58] And then you have a problem in our
[1:09:00] generation.
[1:09:01] The people who don't want to be led.
[1:09:05] You find they don't HAVE A HOME CHURCH.
[1:09:08] believers but they don't have a home
[1:09:10] church. They keep brother says they keep
[1:09:12] floating from pillar to post
[1:09:17] every Sunday IN ANOTHER CHURCH. YOU ASK
[1:09:20] HIM WHAT IS YOUR CHURCH? WHERE DO YOU
[1:09:22] PAY YOUR TITHE? WHERE DO YOU SUPPORT THE
[1:09:25] CAUSE? THE CAUSE, THE VISION
[1:09:29] WHERE THEY DON'T KNOW BUT YOU KNOW THEY
[1:09:31] ARE BELIEVERS. SUCH PEOPLE ARE VERY
[1:09:34] DANGEROUS.
[1:09:35] YOU SEE AND you can you should never
[1:09:37] marry SOMEONE LIKE THAT.
[1:09:40] GETTING MARRIED to someone, YOU MUST
[1:09:42] KNOW WHERE THEIR CHURCH, they must have
[1:09:44] a local body of believers, where they
[1:09:46] call their home.
[1:09:51] Because let me tell you, I'VE SEEN IT,
[1:09:54] YOUNG PEOPLE GETTING MARRIED. AND AFTER
[1:09:56] A WHILE, they have problems,
[1:09:59] but there is no one you can go to talk
[1:10:01] to about that person.
[1:10:05] HE WILL LISTEN TO NOBODY ANYMORE.
[1:10:08] HE WILL ONLY SAY, "WELL, I LISTEN ONLY
[1:10:10] TO GOD."
[1:10:12] So then what are you going to do? YOU'RE
[1:10:15] GOING TO BE CONFUSED.
[1:10:17] YOU MUST have a pastor.
[1:10:19] You must be led.
[1:10:22] You must submit to authority.
[1:10:25] Amen. That's what we believe. You have a
[1:10:27] believer, you should say, "Amen."
[1:10:30] BUT THEN IN A GENERATION,
[1:10:33] we also HAVE A PASTOR.
[1:10:35] I CALL HIM A PASTOR. BECAUSE IT'S A
[1:10:38] VISION bearer
[1:10:40] for the entire AGE
[1:10:43] ALL OVER THE WORLD.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; THAT you know these things are very hard
[1:10:47] to swallow for some
[1:10:50] but it is Bible order.
[1:10:54] You see God calls one man
[1:10:57] AND HE INSPIRES HIM AND HE GIVES HIM A
[1:11:00] THE VISION FOR THE ENTIRE GENERATION.
[1:11:05] WHAT IS IT IS THE WILL OF GOD
[1:11:08] FOR THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THAT AGE.
[1:11:11] We have seven ages. Amen. The last one
[1:11:14] is Ladyia.
[1:11:16] NOW THIS ONE GOD SENT A PROPHET
[1:11:19] AND HIS NAME IS WILLIAM BRAN. NOW HIS
[1:11:22] MESSAGE amen reveals THE VISION
[1:11:27] OUR VISION IN THIS AGE.
[1:11:30] WHAT IS THE VISION of our age? IS THE
[1:11:33] COMING OF THE LORD. WHAT'S THE VISION OF
[1:11:36] THIS AGE? IS VAIN IN THE BRIDE.
[1:11:39] BUT YOU SEE, YOU CANNOT KNOW THIS
[1:11:41] MESSAGE FROM ANYWHERE ELSE.
[1:11:45] OR ROBERT WAS A SERVANT OF GOD. BILLY
[1:11:48] GRAHAM IS A SERVANT OF GOD. BUT THEY CAN
[1:11:50] NEVER SHOW YOU THE VISION OF THIS AGE.
[1:11:55] is only with a vision BEARER
[1:11:59] of the age.
[1:12:02] So you should KNOW WHO YOU ARE
[1:12:03] FOLLOWING.
[1:12:05] AMEN. And thank God we have received the
[1:12:08] message of this age.
[1:12:11] Amen. To say brother Bam is the prophet
[1:12:13] OF THIS AGE
[1:12:16] DOES NOT MEAN THERE ARE NO OTHER
[1:12:18] PREACHERS.
[1:12:21] THAT'S A MISUNDERSTANDING.
[1:12:23] THERE ARE ALSO OTHER PREACHERS.
[1:12:26] I am one of them.
[1:12:29] There are many others. There have been
[1:12:31] many others.
[1:12:34] You know, for for now 50 years.
[1:12:37] And if the Lord tries, WE HAVE MANY
[1:12:39] MORE. GOD IS STILL CALLING. HE'S STILL
[1:12:42] ANOINTING. HE'S STILL SENDING OUT MEN TO
[1:12:46] TAKE THIS MESSAGE. But you see, if God
[1:12:49] calls you in this dispersion,
[1:12:53] amen, to preach this message,
[1:12:56] you will not preach another message.
[1:12:59] You will stay in the vision.
[1:13:03] That's what brother Bam said meant WHEN
[1:13:06] HE SAID STAY IN THE LINE. STAY IN THE
[1:13:09] LINE. MEANING STAY WITH THE VISION OF
[1:13:12] THIS AGE.
[1:13:15] What is the VISION OF THIS AGE? IT'S NOT
[1:13:17] ONLY HEALINGS of the people.
[1:13:20] No, NO, IT'S NOT ONLY MIRACLES AND
[1:13:23] SEVEN.
[1:13:26] NO, the vision of this age
[1:13:29] IS THE RAPTURE
[1:13:31] IS THE CALLING OF A BRIDE,
[1:13:34] IS THE UNVEILING OF THE BRIDE,
[1:13:38] IS THE UNVEILING OF THE BRIDEGROOM AND
[1:13:41] THE BRIDE,
[1:13:43] YOU KNOW. SO, WHAT IT WHAT IS IT DOING?
[1:13:46] IT IS GATHERING THE BRIDE UNTO THE
[1:13:48] BRIDEGROOM.
[1:13:51] IT'S A UNITING TIME.
[1:13:53] THE PURPOSE OF THIS MESSAGE IS FOR OUR
[1:13:56] BODIES TO BE CHANGED.
[1:13:58] IS FOR US TO BE REDEEMED
[1:14:01] TO WHERE WE CAME FROM. THAT IS THE
[1:14:04] PURPOSE OF THE MESSAGE. IN OTHER WORDS,
[1:14:06] THAT'S THE VISION of our generation.
[1:14:09] The rest is all details.
[1:14:13] So if you are a preacher and you are
[1:14:16] called to preach in this dispensation,
[1:14:20] if you are staying in the vision,
[1:14:23] you will stay, you'll preach that.
[1:14:26] Now we see Israel
[1:14:30] for the next few moments we can try to
[1:14:31] use it and go through it a little bit.
[1:14:35] Moses sent them to spy out the land of
[1:14:38] Canaan.
[1:14:40] And they said unto them, "Get you up
[1:14:43] this way, southward, and go up to the
[1:14:45] mountain."
[1:14:48] You see, he's the man with a vision.
[1:14:50] Now he's telling them, you know, you
[1:14:51] cannot just walk into the promised land.
[1:14:55] I want to send 12 men.
[1:14:58] They didn't sit down as a committee to
[1:15:00] decide.
[1:15:02] Moses was led of the Lord
[1:15:05] and he said, "You know what? I'm sending
[1:15:07] 12 men."
[1:15:09] and and Moses sent him out. He said,
[1:15:11] "Now go." AND AND HE EVEN TOLD HIM WHERE
[1:15:13] TO GO.
[1:15:15] HOW DID HE KNOW? GOD WAS SHOWING HIM.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU KNOW, YOUR PASTOR always has
[1:15:21] hidden manner.
[1:15:25] Amen. THE PROPHET OF THE AGE HAS HIDDEN
[1:15:28] [screaming] MANNER FOR OUR GENERATION.
[1:15:32] HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:15:34] You see, and see the land,
[1:15:38] AND SEE WHAT IT IS, AND THE PEOPLE THAT
[1:15:40] DWELLETH THERE IN, WHETHER THEY BE
[1:15:43] STRONG OR WEAK,
[1:15:45] FEW OR MANY, AND WHAT THE LAND is that
[1:15:49] they dwell in, whether it be good or
[1:15:52] bad, and what cities they beh
[1:15:56] that they dwell in, whether in tents
[1:16:00] or in strongholds.
[1:16:03] Amen. Brother Calib, I I I don't want my
[1:16:05] voice to get bad again. I'm going to a
[1:16:06] conversion. Praise God.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; And so then now what what is he trying
[1:16:10] to say?
[1:16:12] Someone who has issues
[1:16:16] may come and begin quoting Moses
[1:16:20] and we saw them. You see, BECAUSE MOSES
[1:16:23] TOLD THEM, GOD HAS TOLD ME THAT I'M
[1:16:26] TAKING ALL OF YOU TO A LAND THAT IS GOOD
[1:16:30] FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY. AND AT THE
[1:16:32] SAME TIME HE SAYS GO SEARCH OUT THE
[1:16:35] LAND. See if it is good or bad. If it is
[1:16:38] evil or good
[1:16:40] WHETHER PEOPLE ARE GIANTS or they are
[1:16:42] many or they SMALLER THAN YOU. SO
[1:16:45] SOMEONE CAN QUOTE HIM AND SAY
[1:16:47] YOU EVEN SEE MOSES WAS NOT [screaming]
[1:16:49] SURE.
[1:16:51] MOSES WAS THINKING MAYBE THEY THE LAND
[1:16:54] IS BAD. [screaming]
[1:16:56] AND THAT'S WHY WHEN THE 10 SPIES CAME
[1:16:58] BACK,
[1:17:00] THEY ALL HAD BAD TESTIMONY.
[1:17:04] They might even have called Moses.
[1:17:08] So God ALLOWS THE MESSENGER
[1:17:11] TO SAY SOMETHING
[1:17:13] TO [screaming] KNOCK OFF SOME PEOPLE.
[1:17:17] AMEN. SO EVERYTHING IN THE MESSAGE
[1:17:20] IS SAID [screaming] OF THE LORD FOR OUR
[1:17:23] GENERATION.
[1:17:25] AMEN. AND SOME THINGS WHICH WERE SAID,
[1:17:28] THEY WERE SAY FOR SOME OTHERS TO
[1:17:30] STUMBLE.
[1:17:33] AMEN. BUT BLESSED ARE YE. IF YOU CANNOT
[1:17:36] STUMBLE,
[1:17:38] BLESSED ARE YE WHO WILL RECEIVE EVERY
[1:17:41] WORD OF GOD
[1:17:43] FOR your generation.
[1:17:46] And he will receive it as thus sayith
[1:17:47] THE LORD.
[1:17:50] And what the land is, whether it be fat
[1:17:52] or clean,
[1:17:55] where there be wood there in
[1:17:59] be of good courage and bring of the
[1:18:02] fruit of the land.
[1:18:04] Now the time was the time of the first
[1:18:06] uh first first ripe grapes.
[1:18:12] And so they go there and as they went
[1:18:15] they you know they come back and the
[1:18:18] Bible says and uh they went and came to
[1:18:21] Moses
[1:18:24] and to Aaron at all the congregation of
[1:18:26] the children of Israel.
[1:18:28] Amen. into the wilderness of par
[1:18:31] to Kadesh
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; and brought back word unto them and unto
[1:18:36] the congregation and showed them the
[1:18:38] FRUIT OF THE LAND. THIS IS CHURCH
[1:18:40] REMEMBER WHERE ARE THEY NOW?
[1:18:45] They are very few meters or kilometers
[1:18:51] to enter canon.
[1:18:54] They just
[1:19:06] You can call the gate of can.
[1:19:10] This is where Kadesh was,
[1:19:13] you know, and and they were JUST ABOUT
[1:19:14] TO ENTER.
[1:19:16] BUT YOU SEE, THEY JUST WANTED TO BE SURE
[1:19:19] WHERE THEY WERE GOING. How was it? And
[1:19:22] Moses sent the spies. And the spies came
[1:19:25] back and they told him with all the
[1:19:29] people there,
[1:19:30] you know, we have always we have very
[1:19:32] many people like this.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Anything. LISTEN CHURCH PASTOR.
[1:19:39] WHAT IS WHAT do you mean by political
[1:19:41] maneuver?
[1:19:45] ANYTHING
[1:19:47] ANYWHERE [screaming]
[1:19:50] ANY ACTION THAT IS DONE OR SAID
[1:19:55] BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE vision
[1:20:00] is a political maneuver
[1:20:04] BECAUSE IT DID NOT COME FROM GOD.
[1:20:07] IT originated from men.
[1:20:12] That's why CHURCH WE MUST NEVER ALLOW
[1:20:15] ourselves to be led by our own feelings,
[1:20:21] BY OUR OWN IDEAS.
[1:20:24] BY OUR OWN THOUGHTS. THE CHURCH IS NOT
[1:20:27] LED BY MEN.
[1:20:30] THE CHURCH IS LED BY THE HOLY GHOST
[1:20:33] AND BY THE WORD. EVERY MAN. THE PASTOR
[1:20:36] MUST HEAR FROM GOD. THE PEOPLE MUST HEAR
[1:20:39] FROM GOD. ALL OF US TOGETHER AS A
[1:20:41] CONGREGATION. WE MUST BE LED BY GOD.
[1:20:45] GOD HAS A WAY. HE LEADS. GOD HAS A
[1:20:48] CHANNEL.
[1:20:50] HE USES A MAN WHO CARRIES THE VISION.
[1:20:54] HE USES A PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE THE VISION
[1:20:58] AND THEN THEY RUN WITH IT.
[1:21:01] So you see here
[1:21:04] these people they came back. They were
[1:21:07] trusted. They were sent and then they
[1:21:11] went into this promised land and they
[1:21:14] came back and they said we came to the
[1:21:17] land where you sent us.
[1:21:20] And surely it flows flowth with milk and
[1:21:22] honey.
[1:21:24] AND THIS IS THE FRUIT.
[1:21:26] NEVERTHELESS,
[1:21:28] whenever you see that thing,
[1:21:31] just know now political maneuvers are
[1:21:33] beginning.
[1:21:36] Yes, I know the WORD SAYS THIS,
[1:21:39] but always run away from that kind of
[1:21:41] spirit.
[1:21:44] I KNOW THE BIBLE SAYS THIS, BUT CLOSE
[1:21:47] YOUR EARS.
[1:21:49] I KNOW BROTHER BAM THE PROPHET SAID THIS
[1:21:52] BUT [screaming]
[1:21:53] CLOSE YOUR EARS. AM I PREACHING TO
[1:21:56] SOMEONE TONIGHT? I KNOW THE PASTOR
[1:21:58] PREACHED LIKE THIS. [screaming] BUT WHAT
[1:22:01] ARE YOU SAYING?
[1:22:04] JUST SAY AMEN.
[1:22:06] THE PASTOR SAID THIS IN THE WORD. AMEN.
[1:22:10] THE WORD SAY THIS. AMEN. THE PROPHET SAY
[1:22:12] THIS. AMEN. DON'T DOUBT. DON'T QUESTION.
[1:22:20] AMEN.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; But these ones they said, "Yes,
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; we have seen the land. It is strong with
[1:22:27] me.
[1:22:30] Here's the fruit to prove it.
[1:22:32] Nevertheless,
[1:22:35] the people
[1:22:37] they are strong
[1:22:39] and the [clears throat] cities world
[1:22:43] and the very great.
[1:22:46] MOREOVER, WE SAW the children of Anarch,
[1:22:50] the Amalachites,
[1:22:52] they dwell in the land of the south. The
[1:22:55] Hittites, THE THE JEBITES, THE AMORITES,
[1:22:59] THEY DWELL IN THE MOUNTAINS. AND THE
[1:23:02] CANONITES,
[1:23:03] THEY DWELL BY the sea and by the coast
[1:23:05] of Jordan.
[1:23:07] They were still talking about this
[1:23:08] gibberish, gibberish, gibberish.
[1:23:12] Let me tell you, brothers and sisters,
[1:23:13] when God SPEAKS TO YOU,
[1:23:16] AMEN. IT MEANS he's ready and he is able
[1:23:20] to accomplish the promise he has given.
[1:23:25] Amen. If God says through through the
[1:23:29] prophet messenger under no circumstance
[1:23:32] should I BELIEVE.
[1:23:34] DON'T say it is impossible. BUT I KNOW
[1:23:37] BROTHER SAID THIS.
[1:23:39] WHY ARE YOU SAYING B?
[1:23:41] LEAVE THE B. SAY IT IS HARD.
[1:23:45] I SAY AMEN TO YOU.
[1:23:49] THERE IS NO B. AMEN. But these people
[1:23:53] here, they are saying but a LOT OF BATS.
[1:23:56] THE LAND IS GOOD. BUT THE AMERICAN
[1:24:00] LAND IS GOOD. But the LAND IS GOOD.
[1:24:05] THE LAND IS GOOD. BUT THE AMORITES, THE
[1:24:07] LAND IS GOOD. AND LASTING. THE LAND IS
[1:24:10] GOOD, BUT HATRED. THE LAND IS GOOD. BUT
[1:24:13] MY DESIRES, THE LAND IS GOOD. BUT MY
[1:24:16] NEIGHBORS, THE LAND IS GOOD. DON'T YOU
[1:24:19] THINK BEFORE [screaming] GOD TOLD YOU
[1:24:22] ABOUT THE LAND,
[1:24:25] HE KNEW ABOUT THE JEBUSITES, THE
[1:24:27] AMERICANS, THE AMORITES. HE KNEW ALL OF
[1:24:30] THEM, BUT HE NEVER TALKED ABOUT THEM
[1:24:34] BECAUSE THEY SO INSIGNIFICANT.
[1:24:38] AMEN.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; GOD KNEW YOUR WEAKNESSES.
[1:24:41] GOD KNEW THE SINS THAT EASILY BESET YOU.
[1:24:46] [screaming] BUT HE NEVER TALKED ABOUT
[1:24:47] IT. HE TALKED ABOUT THE LIE. HE TALKED
[1:24:50] ABOUT THE PROMISE. WHY? [screaming]
[1:24:53] BECAUSE HE KNEW ALL THESE OTHER THINGS
[1:24:56] ARE REALLY INSIGNIFICANT.
[1:24:59] THE PROMISE MUST ALWAYS COME TO PASS.
[1:25:04] WHAT [screaming] GOD SAYS MUST HAPPEN.
[1:25:07] WHAT GOD PROMISES MUST BE FULFILLED.
[1:25:11] [screaming] STOP LOOKING
[1:25:13] AT YOUR GENOCIDES,
[1:25:16] AT YOUR RIGHT. AMEN. BECAUSE THEY ARE SO
[1:25:19] INSIGNIFICANT.
[1:25:21] THEY DON'T MATTER.
[1:25:25] HALLELUJAH. LET ME HAVE SOMEONE SHOUT.
[1:25:27] AMEN. [screaming]
[1:25:29] YES, SIR.
[1:25:31] the Anakites,
[1:25:33] the Hittites, THE CANONITES,
[1:25:36] IT DOESN'T MEAN a thing. And here is a
[1:25:39] man that had caught the vision.
[1:25:42] Amen. Tell your neighbor, catch the
[1:25:43] vision, brother. Catch the vision,
[1:25:46] brother. Catch the vision, BROTHER.
[1:25:49] [screaming]
[1:25:51] OH, God bless you, brother.
[1:25:54] Amen. We have over here and over there.
[1:25:58] Praise God. AND STILL THE PEOPLE
[1:26:03] before Moses and said, "Oh, let us go
[1:26:08] together
[1:26:12] and possess it."
[1:26:14] I love
[1:26:25] said, "Let us go up at once.
[1:26:27] Let us go up at once.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; I don't know whether I'm talking to
[1:26:31] Calbs
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; or I'm talking to the 10 spies.
[1:26:36] [laughter]
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, brother.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Let us go up at once.
[1:26:42] Amen. You people, you better BE ON FIRE.
[1:26:45] STOP BEING COLD.
[1:26:47] CATCH THE VISION.
[1:26:49] LET US GO UP AT ONCE. [screaming] LET US
[1:26:52] GO UP AT ONCE. AMEN. But they said we
[1:26:56] CAN'T TAKE THE LAND. THE LAND IS OURS.
[1:26:59] THE PROMISE CAME THROUGH OUR PROPHET
[1:27:02] MESSENGER.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; OH MY.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL ANOINTED to say
[1:27:07] right now?
[1:27:09] GOD PROMISED US LAND
[1:27:11] EVEN AS A CHURCH. AMEN. AMEN. YOU
[1:27:14] REMEMBER THE VISION I CAME AND TOLD YOU
[1:27:16] HERE SAID WE SHALL GET IT. LET ME TELL
[1:27:19] YOU BROTHERS AND SISTERS, WE ARE HALFWAY
[1:27:21] THERE.
[1:27:23] WE ARE GETTING THE LAND.
[1:27:25] LET THOSE WHO DOUBT DOUBT.
[1:27:28] BUT GOD SAID IT, GOD WILL ACCOMPLISH IT.
[1:27:33] THERE IS ANOTHER PART. I SAID THERE'S
[1:27:35] ANOTHER PART. THOSE ONES WHO HAD THE
[1:27:38] REVELATION
[1:27:40] AND THEY BEGAN POWERING HIM,
[1:27:43] POWERING IT LITTLE
[1:27:45] BY LITTLE. ARE YOU HERE? LITTLE BY
[1:27:48] LITTLE. I SAY THIS AS YOUR PASTOR NOW.
[1:27:53] AS YOUR PASTOR
[1:27:54] I AM ANOINTED TO TELL YOU PREPARE FOR
[1:27:57] YOUR OWN BLESSING.
[1:28:01] AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; I AM NOT JUST EXCITED. I AM STANDING IN
[1:28:05] [screaming] THE WORLD. I KNOW WHAT I'M
[1:28:07] TALKING ABOUT. PREPARE FOR YOUR OWN WAY.
[1:28:11] AMEN. HALLELUJAH. YOU CAN'T FAKE THIS.
[1:28:14] YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS. YOU DON'T PRAY FOR
[1:28:16] A BLESSING. YOU [screaming] DO WHAT GOD
[1:28:19] SAID DO
[1:28:21] AND THEN WATCH WHAT WHETHER HE WAS
[1:28:22] FULFILLED OR NOT.
[1:28:27] CALB STEAL THE PEOPLE BEFORE MOSES AND
[1:28:30] HE SAID, "LET US GO UP AT ONCE
[1:28:34] AND POSSESS HIM,
[1:28:37] FOR WE ARE WELL AABLE,
[1:28:40] WE ARE WELL ABLE TO OVERCOME."
[1:28:45] HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:47] BUT THE MEN THAT WENT UP WITH HIM,
[1:28:50] they said, "We be not able
[1:28:54] to go against the people for they are
[1:28:57] stronger than we. Don't you think KNEW
[1:29:00] THAT?
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU THINK JOSHUA KNEW THAT?
[1:29:05] BUT THE BIBLE SAYS THEY BROUGHT UP AN
[1:29:08] EVIL REPORT
[1:29:10] of the land which THEY HAD SEARCHED
[1:29:13] UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, SAYING,
[1:29:16] "The land through which we HAVE GONE TO
[1:29:18] SEARCH, IT IS THE land that Edth in
[1:29:22] Pharaoh
[1:29:24] and all the people THAT THAT WE SAW IN
[1:29:26] IT ARE MEN OF GOD. AND THERE WE SAW
[1:29:30] GIANTS AS SONS OF ANARCH WHICH COME OF
[1:29:33] THE giants and were in our we WERE AS
[1:29:36] GRASSHOPPERS IN THE SIGHT.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Let me TELL YOU DON'T DESPISE YOURSELF.
[1:29:45] HALLELUJAH. They were thinking THEY WERE
[1:29:47] TOO SMALL.
[1:29:49] THEY WERE THINKING THEY CANNOT ACHIEVE
[1:29:51] THIS PURPOSE.
[1:29:53] THEY WERE THINKING THE VISION IS TOO
[1:29:54] GREAT FOR THEM.
[1:29:56] BUT REMEMBER, IT WAS NOT THEIR VISION.
[1:30:01] IT WAS GOD'S VISION.
[1:30:04] MAN HAS A VISION. GOD HAS A VISION. MAN
[1:30:08] HAS A PROGRAM. BUT ALSO [screaming] GOD
[1:30:10] HAS A PROBLEM. AND THE PROGRAM OF MAN
[1:30:14] WILL ALWAYS FAIL. BUT [screaming] GOD IS
[1:30:16] PROGRAM NEVER FAIL. LET ME TELL SOME OF
[1:30:20] YOU. I AM A PROJECT OF GOD.
[1:30:24] YOU ARE A PROJECT [screaming] OF GOD.
[1:30:27] GOD IS BUILDING YOU. GOD IS MAKING A
[1:30:30] GIANT OUT OF YOU. YOU MAY NOT SEE IT
[1:30:33] NOW, BUT RATHER YOU ARE BIGGER THAN YOU
[1:30:36] KNOW.
[1:30:38] GOD HAS GIVEN YOU A VISION THAT IS MUCH
[1:30:40] BIGGER THAN YOU ARE BECAUSE HE THAT IS
[1:30:44] IN YOU IS GREATER THAN HE [screaming]
[1:30:46] THAT IS IN THE WORLD.
[1:30:49] HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY THIS ALSO.
[1:30:54] GOD DOES NOT WORK WITH MONEY.
[1:30:58] GOD COMMANDS MONEY TO WORK FOR YOU
[1:31:02] WHEN HE NEEDS IT. BUT GOD DOES NOT NEED
[1:31:05] MONEY TO WORK.
[1:31:07] THAT'S WHY I TOLD YOU ON SUNDAY AND I
[1:31:09] MEANT IT AS FAR AS THE MINISTRY is
[1:31:12] concerned.
[1:31:14] AMEN. WHATEVER GOD INSPIRES ME TO DO, I
[1:31:18] START ON IT.
[1:31:20] I ANNOUNCE IT. I I PLAN ON IT WHETHER I
[1:31:24] HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT OR NOT.
[1:31:26] AND LOOKING BACK YEARS,
[1:31:29] NONE OF IT HAS EVER FAILED.
[1:31:33] As long as I did it by inspiration
[1:31:37] IN THE MIDDLE, MANY TIMES I HAVE
[1:31:39] QUESTIONS MYSELF. WAS THAT GOD? IS IT
[1:31:43] THE WILL OF GOD? SHOULD I STOP? SHOULD I
[1:31:47] QUIT? YOU SEE, WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS, YOU
[1:31:50] KNOW. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, BROTHER. IF
[1:31:53] GOD INSPIRES YOU, GOD SPEAKS TO YOU,
[1:31:57] NEVER DOUBT HIM. BECAUSE IT'S A GOD THAT
[1:32:01] NEVER FAILS.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. HE TOLD THEM, "GO AND TAKE
[1:32:09] THE LAND." BUT THESE OTHER 10 SPIES,
[1:32:13] THEY SAID, "THESE men are so greater
[1:32:15] than we are.
[1:32:17] WE ARE SMALL AND THEY'RE BIG.
[1:32:20] WE WERE LIKE GRASSHOPPERS.
[1:32:22] IT DOES NOT MATTER. You may be like a
[1:32:25] grasshopper.
[1:32:26] Amen. When you compare yourself on THE
[1:32:28] VISION,
[1:32:30] BUT BROTHER, SISTER, BROTHER, SISTER,
[1:32:33] HAVE FAITH IN GOD.
[1:32:35] HAVE FAITH IN GOD.
[1:32:37] DO NOT let anything
[1:32:40] obscure the vision from yourself.
[1:32:44] DON'T LET PEOPLE TALK YOU OUT OF THE
[1:32:46] VISION.
[1:32:49] AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I TELL YOU WHAT, THERE ARE MANY
[1:32:55] PEOPLE THAT LIKE TALKING
[1:32:58] AND TALKING AND TALKING AND THEY TALK
[1:33:01] AGAINST YOU. BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT? THE
[1:33:04] MORE THEY TALK ABOUT YOU, THE MORE GOD
[1:33:07] LIFTS YOU.
[1:33:09] I HAVE SEEN THAT IN MY OWN LIFE.
[1:33:12] PEOPLE WHO LIKE TALKING.
[1:33:14] YOU REMEMBER HOW THEY TALKED AGAINST
[1:33:17] JOB.
[1:33:18] PEOPLE CAN TALK BROTHER BUT DON'T LET
[1:33:21] THE PEOPLE'S words
[1:33:24] to make YOUR THE VISION BEFORE YOU
[1:33:26] BLIND.
[1:33:32] THEY MAY SEE US HERE SITTING MAXIMUM
[1:33:35] MAYBE 200 PEOPLE 150
[1:33:38] AND THEY THINK IT'S A SMALL MESSAGE WE
[1:33:40] ARE CARRYING.
[1:33:42] THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE CARRYING.
[1:33:46] BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. CALB AND
[1:33:49] JOSHUA THAT TIME
[1:33:51] THE FIRE THEY WERE FEELING
[1:33:54] MAYBE THEY WERE SAYING IT'S ONLY A
[1:33:56] MATTER OF TIME.
[1:33:59] EVERYBODY WILL SEE [screaming] EVERYBODY
[1:34:02] WILL KNOW IT WAS NOT OUR VISION. IT WAS
[1:34:06] THE VISION OF THE LORD. HE ANOINTED US
[1:34:10] UNDER THE MESSAGE OF A OF A VISION
[1:34:13] BEARER
[1:34:15] MOSES OUR PROPHET AND HE SENT US TO GO
[1:34:19] INTO the promised land.
[1:34:22] The denominations may think
[1:34:25] that we are some little little toms and
[1:34:28] some little susies on the
[1:34:32] on the back side.
[1:34:34] Brother, sister, we need to arise
[1:34:38] and catch the video
[1:34:41] and know what we are trying to do.
[1:34:44] We have a message, brothers.
[1:34:46] We're not just running aimlessly.
[1:34:51] We not even building an organization.
[1:34:54] Forget about that. We are not even
[1:34:57] trying TO BUILD A CHURCH.
[1:34:59] FORGET ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE A VISION.
[1:35:04] MY voice I feel right now is so small.
[1:35:08] I WISH THE HOLY GHOST CAN MAGNIFY IN
[1:35:11] YOUR HEART.
[1:35:13] WE HAVE A VISION AND WE ARE RUNNING
[1:35:16] BEHIND THAT VISION.
[1:35:18] DO YOU KNOW THE VISION WE HAVE?
[1:35:21] GOD HAS SENT US A MESSAGE.
[1:35:24] IT IS A THUS SAYETH THE [screaming]
[1:35:25] LORD. IT'S A MESSAGE TO RUN AWAY FROM
[1:35:29] NATIONS. AMEN. TO WHERE TO TO WHERE TO
[1:35:33] THE RAPTURE.
[1:35:35] I TELL YOU WHAT, REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE
[1:35:37] DEVIL TRIES TO DO
[1:35:39] TO HINDER US, HE CANNOT STOP US. BROTHER
[1:35:44] SAMUEL, WE [screaming] ARE THE
[1:35:45] UNSTOPPABLE BRIDE.
[1:35:49] I SAID HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:35:50] HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW WHERE WE ARE GOING. WE ARE GOING
[1:35:53] IN A RAPTURE. WE ARE NOT HERE FOR
[1:35:57] POLITICAL MANEUVERS TO FIGHT POLITICS.
[1:36:04] THAT'S ALL NONSENSE.
[1:36:07] WE HAVE A MESSAGE. WE ARE RUNNING AWAY.
[1:36:11] WE HAVE A VISION
[1:36:13] THAT WE ARE CARRYING IN THIS end time.
[1:36:18] I just pray and and wish everybody could
[1:36:20] could get that.
[1:36:23] Let me tell you, if we understand that
[1:36:28] EVF,
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; we are going to begin sponsoring
[1:36:31] missionaries
[1:36:34] to go all over the world.
[1:36:37] Hallelujah.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; At this point, you may think now I'm
[1:36:39] running crazy.
[1:36:42] I know what I'm talking about.
[1:36:45] We are going to begin financially
[1:36:47] supporting missionaries,
[1:36:50] sending preachers into the field,
[1:36:54] This church we're trying to build, IT
[1:36:56] WILL BE SOMETHING VERY SMALL.
[1:36:59] IF YOU CAN CATCH THE VISION, YOU WILL
[1:37:01] REALIZE THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE PASTOR.
[1:37:04] THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE CHURCH. IT'S ABOUT
[1:37:06] THE WORD. GOD HAS GIVEN TO US IN OUR
[1:37:10] GENERATION
[1:37:12] AND then you will RISE ABOVE
[1:37:15] your small little ideas
[1:37:17] and say we let us stand behind you.
[1:37:21] Yesterday on our family altar,
[1:37:25] I I just uh was speaking with my
[1:37:28] children and we read a scripture which
[1:37:32] Jesus was saying, you know, because the
[1:37:33] disciples were saying stay with us.
[1:37:37] He said, "No, for this reason I was born
[1:37:40] and I will go and preach the gospel to
[1:37:41] all over the world." And I told him
[1:37:43] that's why I go all over the world.
[1:37:45] That's why I travel and leave you. And I
[1:37:48] got to preach because I have a calling.
[1:37:51] This is the purpose reason why I was
[1:37:52] born.
[1:37:54] And then I asked each of them if you
[1:37:56] were to die right now
[1:37:59] and you reach in the presence of God and
[1:38:02] you are asked
[1:38:04] what did you do with the life God gave
[1:38:08] you?
[1:38:10] What will you answer?
[1:38:12] What did you do?
[1:38:15] What what will you say? Would you say I
[1:38:18] lived
[1:38:20] ate a lot of food, slept, worked for my
[1:38:24] boss?
[1:38:26] What would you say? What would you do?
[1:38:31] You see? Each of them began taking
[1:38:34] inventory.
[1:38:36] You know, the only thing that will
[1:38:38] matter
[1:38:40] is what you have done for the Lord.
[1:38:46] All the other things you did will not
[1:38:48] matter that I was a businessman
[1:38:53] running up and down and selling my
[1:38:54] products
[1:38:58] that you know I was educated.
[1:39:00] So I I was just going around and trying
[1:39:03] to to study and and work and
[1:39:07] and make some money.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; So what did you do with the money?
[1:39:12] You know I had to eat
[1:39:14] I had to buy clothes.
[1:39:17] You know, I also got children and so I
[1:39:18] had to take care of them.
[1:39:21] You can't even say that in his presence.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; You remember the man. I think it was
[1:39:29] Hezekiah
[1:39:31] that you know the king and you know he
[1:39:34] had to ask God
[1:39:36] please remember the good things I did
[1:39:40] for your work, for your kingdom.
[1:39:43] He began listing them. And then God was
[1:39:46] touched
[1:39:47] and he said, "Okay, 15 more years."
[1:39:53] Now if it was you,
[1:39:57] what would you tell the Lord that you
[1:39:58] have done
[1:40:01] even coming to church? You can't even
[1:40:03] come to church.
[1:40:05] I can't say that because that was
[1:40:06] helping myself.
[1:40:10] You will think what did I do?
[1:40:13] They play church instrument.
[1:40:16] But then the pastor forced me that day.
[1:40:19] It was not from my heart.
[1:40:22] So what did I do? I remember they begged
[1:40:25] me to go and no no. They begged me to
[1:40:28] sweep the ch.
[1:40:31] So I did not do it for my
[1:40:33] So what what did I do?
[1:40:37] Nothing.
[1:40:41] Ask yourselves,
[1:40:43] what have you done for the Lord?
[1:40:47] If you haven't,
[1:40:49] then you've not caught the vision.
[1:40:52] We need to catch the vision. We need to
[1:40:54] catch the vision, saints.
[1:40:58] Now,
[1:41:00] uh this is um a point that uh I want to
[1:41:04] talk about redemption by judgment.
[1:41:08] Brother Bam says, "Now Israel come up to
[1:41:10] Kadesh Banana."
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; And here they come come back and Joshua
[1:41:16] and Calb, they were really all fired up.
[1:41:21] They must have had a prayer meeting over
[1:41:23] there.
[1:41:26] A real revival of some sort among
[1:41:28] themselves.
[1:41:31] AND WHEN THEY COME BACK, THEY SAID,
[1:41:34] "YES,
[1:41:35] WE CAN TAKE HER.
[1:41:38] HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; BUT THE other 10 said
[1:41:42] no, we can't do that. Is that too much
[1:41:45] for us?
[1:41:47] Lack of faith.
[1:41:50] NOW LISTEN, CHRISTIANS, EVERYTHING IS
[1:41:52] BASED ON FAITH.
[1:41:55] AND FAITH CANNOT be right
[1:41:58] UNLESS IT'S GOT SOMETHING TO BE BASED
[1:42:01] ON.
[1:42:06] YOU CAN'T HAVE FAITH.
[1:42:10] SAY WELL I BELIEVE THAT I BELIEVE THIS
[1:42:11] IS MY BELIEF. MY BELIEF IS NO good
[1:42:17] if it is contrary to God's belief.
[1:42:21] You see WHY WE NEED VISION?
[1:42:24] BECAUSE YOU SEE
[1:42:26] WHEN GOD SENDS A MAN,
[1:42:29] ANOINTS HIM AND HE TELLS YOU GOD IS
[1:42:32] BELIEF.
[1:42:35] GOD HIS BELIEF WAS
[1:42:37] YOU WILL TAKE THE LAND
[1:42:40] FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY THAT WAS
[1:42:42] SPOKEN BY A GOD VINDICATED MAN.
[1:42:48] SO THEY HAD TO BASE THEIR FAITH ON THAT.
[1:42:55] AMEN. Do you know you can be sick in
[1:42:59] your body? You you walk right here at
[1:43:01] THE ALTAR
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; AND I JUST TELL YOU YOU ARE HEALED and
[1:43:05] you say amen AND YOU GET HEALED. WHY?
[1:43:10] HOW? WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT CHEMISTRY?
[1:43:13] IT WAS FAITH BASED ON WHAT THE MAN OF
[1:43:16] GOD SAYING. HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:20] THAT'S why when YOU'RE HEARING THE WORD,
[1:43:23] DON'T JUST BE QUIET. SAY AMEN.
[1:43:25] WHY? BECAUSE YOUR FAITH IS BASED ON
[1:43:28] HEARING AND RECEIVING AND BELIEVING.
[1:43:34] But my belief is no good if it's
[1:43:35] contrary to God's belief.
[1:43:39] But if my belief with his ties with his
[1:43:45] then I GOT A FOUNDATION SONG.
[1:43:49] NO MATTER WHAT TAKES PLACE.
[1:43:52] WE ARE JUST GOING TO GO ANY
[1:43:56] because God said so.
[1:43:59] Amen. Now, that's the type of faith
[1:44:03] that Calb and Joshua have.
[1:44:06] Amen. That's the kind of faith I want to
[1:44:09] have
[1:44:10] because God said something.
[1:44:13] I believe it. That settles it.
[1:44:18] Amen. In a message presuming 1962,
[1:44:22] now Israel had sinned
[1:44:24] and had been grumbling and complaining
[1:44:27] and they come to a place called Kadesh
[1:44:31] and that was really the judgment seat.
[1:44:35] For out of there where went judgment
[1:44:38] and the days where Israel was judged
[1:44:40] KADESH BAN.
[1:44:44] WE ARE TOLD IT'S A LITTLE PLACE IN THE
[1:44:46] DESERT THE OTHER SIDE of Jordan
[1:44:51] that's got a few palm trees
[1:44:54] and in there there is one great spring
[1:44:56] of water
[1:44:59] and several small springs
[1:45:01] which MEANS A BEAUTIFUL TYPE WE COULD
[1:45:03] get
[1:45:06] of God's throne
[1:45:08] being the HOUSE OF JUDGMENT.
[1:45:12] AND THE LITTLE JUDGMENT PLACES COMING up
[1:45:16] because kadesh ban means judgment.
[1:45:20] This is a little judgment place where we
[1:45:21] are right now.
[1:45:24] And there is where Israel was judged
[1:45:27] because of their chiding,
[1:45:30] you know, like like uh uh resisting the
[1:45:34] word
[1:45:37] and and disobedience [clears throat]
[1:45:39] and interruption of the program of God.
[1:45:43] Are you hearing that?
[1:45:45] They are chiding. They are disobedience.
[1:45:48] They interruption
[1:45:50] of THE PROGRAM OF GOD.
[1:45:54] GOD HAS a program
[1:45:57] for every individual.
[1:46:03] God has a program
[1:46:05] for every local church.
[1:46:09] GOD HAS A PROGRAM
[1:46:12] FOR every generation.
[1:46:15] GOD HAS A PROGRAM
[1:46:18] FOR EVERY SEASON.
[1:46:21] You see never interrupt
[1:46:25] the program of God.
[1:46:28] A very TYPE OF TODAY
[1:46:30] THE CHURCH IN ITS DIFFERENCE differences
[1:46:34] interrupts the program OF GOD.
[1:46:38] GOD WANTS US TO GATHER AS ONE HEART,
[1:46:42] ONE SOUL, ONE MIND, [screaming]
[1:46:46] A RE repeat of Pentecost.
[1:46:51] Praise God.
[1:46:54] Now in the Smanian church age, he says
[1:46:57] only two were true believers, true
[1:46:59] believers.
[1:47:01] That is correct because the word tells
[1:47:02] us that the rest died because of
[1:47:04] unbelief.
[1:47:08] And because of unbelief they could not
[1:47:10] enter in.
[1:47:13] Then since that is so
[1:47:16] and only two entered
[1:47:19] then the rest were not true believers.
[1:47:23] Can you imagine that? What made the
[1:47:25] difference?
[1:47:28] It's a question.
[1:47:32] two stayed with the one
[1:47:35] when the hearts of the 10 spies failed
[1:47:37] at Kadesh.
[1:47:42] JOSHUA AND KAB DID NOT STAGGER FOR THEY
[1:47:44] BELIEVED THE WORD [screaming]
[1:47:48] and they SAID WE ARE MORE THAN ABLE
[1:47:52] TO TAKE THE LAND.
[1:47:54] THEY KNEW THAT they could be they could
[1:47:56] because God had said I have given you
[1:47:59] the land.
[1:48:03] After all those Israelites saw of the
[1:48:06] power and goodness and the deliverance
[1:48:07] of God, THEY DID NOT ENTER INTO REST.
[1:48:16] AND BROTHER BANHAM GOES AHEAD. ARE YOU
[1:48:18] LISTENING? Can you say amen? Brother
[1:48:22] Bham GOES AHEAD TO TELL US WHAT THIS
[1:48:25] REST WAS.
[1:48:27] He says they didn't they they didn't
[1:48:29] enter into THE REST
[1:48:32] WHICH IS A TYPE OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:48:36] SO YOU CAN SEE RIGHT NOW THAT VERY FEW
[1:48:40] WILL BELIEVE ALL THE WAY [screaming]
[1:48:43] TO RECEIVE IN THE SPIRIT OF GOD.
[1:48:51] HELLO.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; This is shocking. Imagine
[1:48:59] these people had come all the way.
[1:49:04] Oh my.
[1:49:06] I just quit around here and then I
[1:49:07] finish later. But listen,
[1:49:11] talking of their journey
[1:49:13] came a long way. Talk about their
[1:49:16] departure
[1:49:18] from Egypt. Talk about their crossing of
[1:49:20] the Red Sea. Talk about the wideness of
[1:49:23] shoe
[1:49:24] and the days they had WITHOUT WITHOUT
[1:49:26] WATER.
[1:49:28] HOW WHAT Moses did for them
[1:49:30] turn the bitter water into sweet
[1:49:33] the wilderness of sin the quills and the
[1:49:37] the meat that was provided there
[1:49:41] Mount Si
[1:49:42] and then all the THINGS THEY WENT
[1:49:44] THROUGH. NOW THEY HAVE ARRIVED AT KADESH
[1:49:48] WHICH IS THE LAST LAST STOP.
[1:49:53] THE LAST [screaming] PLACE
[1:49:56] THEY HAVE COME THROUGH ALL THE STAGES.
[1:50:01] THEY HAVE RECEIVED THE WORD. THEY HAVE
[1:50:03] BEEN JUSTIFIED.
[1:50:06] THEY HAVE BEEN SANCTIFIED. [screaming]
[1:50:09] AMEN. BUT THEN THEY REACH KADESH AND
[1:50:12] THEY SAID WE WILL NOT ENTER IN.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; [gasps]
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE LAND WE HAVE HEARD,
[1:50:20] WE HAVE HEARD BY OUR OWN EARS.
[1:50:22] THE LAND IS EVIL. THE LAND SWALLOWS its
[1:50:26] own inhabitants.
[1:50:28] THE LAND HAS GIANTS.
[1:50:30] THE LAND IS TERRIBLE. WE WILL NOT ENTER.
[1:50:34] ARE YOU HEARING ME, CHURCH? WHAT IS THIS
[1:50:36] [screaming] LAND?
[1:50:38] WELL, IT WAS a land for them physically.
[1:50:41] THEY FAILED TO ENTER IT. BAM SAYS TODAY
[1:50:46] IS A TYPE OF THE [screaming] HOLY GHOST
[1:50:49] AND THE BRIDE THE CHURCH HAS REACHED
[1:50:52] KADESH
[1:50:54] YOU KNOW BELIEVED ALL THE MYSTERIES
[1:50:57] ACCEPTED ALL THE WORD AND DID YOU KNOW
[1:51:00] MANY SO-CALLED BELIEVERS
[1:51:03] MANY OF THEM THINK BY RECEIVING THE WORD
[1:51:05] THEY HAVE THE HOLY Ghost
[1:51:09] and MANY OF THEM REJECT THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:51:12] DID YOU KNOW THAT
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; THEY REFUSE TO ENTER THE REST.
[1:51:17] THEY REFUSE TO ENTER THE LAND. AND THEY
[1:51:20] ONLY STOP AT KADESH.
[1:51:22] BUT LET ME TELL YOU CHURCH, WE HAVE A
[1:51:24] PEOPLE IN THIS GENERATION THAT ARE NOT
[1:51:27] GOING TO STOP AT NOTHING. IT MAY NOT BE
[1:51:30] EASY FOR YOU TO CROSS OVER, AMEN, AND
[1:51:33] OVERCOME AND RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST. BUT
[1:51:36] I TELL YOU WHAT, BROTHER, IF YOU
[1:51:38] BELIEVE, BELIEVE WHAT I'M TELLING YOU
[1:51:41] RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE GOD PROMISED ME, GOD
[1:51:45] SAID IT, I MUST RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:51:49] I MUST ENTER INTO THE LAND. I MUST BE
[1:51:52] BORN AGAIN.
[1:51:54] SOMETHING MUST HAPPEN.
[1:51:56] WHY? BECAUSE GOD SAID SO. [screaming]
[1:52:00] REPENT AND BE BAPTIZED EVERY ONE OF YOU
[1:52:03] AND RECEIVE REMISSION OF SINS AND THEN
[1:52:07] RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:52:10] IT IS A PROMISE.
[1:52:12] TELL YOUR NEIGHBOR, IT IS A PROMISE.
[1:52:15] IT IS A PROMISE. HE SAID HE SHALL THE
[1:52:18] PROMISE IS UNTO YOU
[1:52:20] AND YOUR CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDREN AND
[1:52:23] THEIR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN.
[1:52:26] AMEN. IT'S A PROMISE GIVEN. IT MUST BE A
[1:52:30] PROMISE kept
[1:52:33] in our generation.
[1:52:36] Hallelujah.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; But there are some who refuse it. They
[1:52:40] would say we will not enter.
[1:52:43] We will not enter. We are okay here at
[1:52:45] Kadesh.
[1:52:46] We'd rather go back to Egypt. But here
[1:52:49] at Kadesh is a very good
[1:52:53] let us stay here.
[1:52:56] We have our prophet.
[1:52:58] We have the message. THAT'S ENOUGH. IT'S
[1:53:01] NOT [screaming] ENOUGH.
[1:53:05] YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL, ME AS AN
[1:53:07] INDIVIDUAL, YOU MUST BE FILLED WITH THE
[1:53:10] HOLY [screaming] GHOST.
[1:53:14] HALLELUJAH.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Whether you like me or you don't like
[1:53:16] me, what I'm saying is the truth.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Pastor, you are now taking us deeper. I
[1:53:27] said, pastor, YOU'RE NOW CONFUSING US. I
[1:53:29] THOUGHT YOU HAVE ALREADY COME OUT OF
[1:53:31] EGYPT.
[1:53:32] YES, THAT [screaming] WAS THE FIRST
[1:53:34] STAGE.
[1:53:38] I THOUGHT I WAS EXCITED AND THINGS
[1:53:40] HAPPENED.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; YES, THAT WAS ANOTHER STAGE.
[1:53:45] HE SAID, I GIVE THEM A NEW HEART. I GIVE
[1:53:47] THEM A NEW SPIRIT. AND I PUT MY
[1:53:50] [screaming] SPIRIT ON THEM.
[1:53:53] GOD IS RAISING A CHURCH IN HIS LAST
[1:53:54] NAME.
[1:53:56] CAN YOU IMAGINE? I HAD A BELIEVE OF THE
[1:53:59] MESSAGE.
[1:54:02] TALKING uh about people WHO SPEAK IN
[1:54:05] TONGUES,
[1:54:07] CALLING IT GIBBERISH.
[1:54:10] LET ME TELL YOU BROTHERS, THEY ARE
[1:54:13] REJECTING ENTERING IN.
[1:54:15] BUT WE MUST ENTER IN.
[1:54:18] WE MUST ACCEPT TO ENTER IN. WHY? BECAUSE
[1:54:22] CANON LAND IS OURS.
[1:54:24] I SAID THE LAND IS OURS.
[1:54:27] SHOUTING IS OURS. REJOICING IS OURS. THE
[1:54:30] HOLY GHOST IS OURS. ALL THE PROMISES OF
[1:54:33] GOD, OVERCOMING POWER IS OURS.
[1:54:38] HALLELUJAH.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:54:43] THIS WAS THE border
[1:54:46] of the promised land. And they refused
[1:54:48] to enter in. And until today, they
[1:54:52] refused to enter in.
[1:54:54] Now, when we come next,
[1:54:57] I'm going to tell you what happened
[1:54:58] next.
[1:55:00] If they refuse,
[1:55:02] anyone who refuses
[1:55:05] to enter in is terrible.
[1:55:11] We'll talk about it next time. God bless
[1:55:13] you.
[1:55:18] [applause]
[1:55:22] Holy Spirit just come before you right
[1:55:25] now.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Father Lord, we are crying Forgive
[1:55:30] us Lord if we have rejected you many
[1:55:35] times maybe in our ignorance.
[1:55:38] Lord have mercy on us. Let your let let
[1:55:41] your living water flow in our hearts.
[1:55:45] Fill us every day. Fill us every time.
[1:55:49] May we know you in the power of your
[1:55:50] resurrection.
[1:55:53] Many struggling with this and that. May
[1:55:55] you come Lord and Amen. Burn out ALL THE
[1:55:58] DRAWS. BAN OUT ALL THE DRAWS. BURN OUT
[1:56:01] ALL THE DRAWS. BURN OUT ALL THE DRAWS.
[1:56:04] LET THERE BE A new living
[1:56:07] life going out of each of us that we may
[1:56:11] know you, Lord
[1:56:13] only, but in the power and demonstration
[1:56:15] of the word.
[1:56:18] Father,
[1:56:19] there's many things that will come up
[1:56:22] and try to obscure other.
[1:56:25] But Lord Jesus, help us to stay focused
[1:56:30] on the vision in this last
[1:56:34] us
[1:56:36] to change us that we might be in the
[1:56:39] stature
[1:56:42] of Christ.
[1:56:44] Oh grant it, Lord.
[1:56:46] Why don't you speak to him, sir? [music]

[2:04:54] as we are going to close the service.
[2:05:03] Lord, I want to say that I surrender my
[2:05:04] life to you.
[2:05:10] Let the holy flame
[2:05:13] of the Holy Spirit
[2:05:17] come and burn in my heart.
[2:05:21] Lord, I pray that each one here
[2:05:25] may accept
[2:05:27] to enter in.
[2:05:31] Let us not stay at Kadesh.
[2:05:34] Let us go all the way
[2:05:38] where you are leading us
[2:05:41] through this message of our
[2:05:45] Lord Jesus.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; How we saw hunger and thirst.
[2:05:52] I pray your blessing Lord upon the
[2:05:54] people.
[2:05:57] May you continue to deal with us
[2:06:00] even as you're preparing us Lord for the
[2:06:02] youth conference.
[2:06:06] Lord, may you prepare our hearts,
[2:06:09] prepare our mind and even of all those
[2:06:12] that are preparing, Lord, for this time
[2:06:16] that you'll come, Lord, and do the
[2:06:18] marvelous work.
[2:06:21] Establish your people, Father,
[2:06:25] in the present truth.
[2:06:28] Lead them, Lord, that they may be able
[2:06:29] to focus on the vision.
[2:06:33] Lord, I pray even as we are going to
[2:06:35] take the trip, the long trip to
[2:06:37] Karamoja,
[2:06:40] may your holy angel watch over us, lead
[2:06:43] us,
[2:06:45] guide us, Lord,
[2:06:47] Lord. Even the meetings, may you bless
[2:06:49] them, Lord,
[2:06:51] all the thousands of people that are
[2:06:53] going to be gathered.
[2:06:56] Lord, you know their hearts.
[2:06:58] Some seek and need help here.
[2:07:02] Others just need to Lord be grounded
[2:07:04] more in the present truth
[2:07:07] that could be there.
[2:07:09] May you meet them before we
[2:07:12] and Lord we pray for our brother that is
[2:07:14] arriving mass [music]
[2:07:17] traveling masses.

[2:07:22] And as we are going to give before we

[2:09:17] grew up under ministry
[2:09:21] as
[2:09:26] you can go
[2:09:28] that would be wonderful. I know you may

[2:09:35] hear it
[2:09:38] then you can prepare to go if you can.
[2:09:42] God [music] bless you. We have
[2:09:48] Can you come up brother and explain
[2:09:50] this?
[2:10:08] God bless you saints.
[2:10:10] I greet you all in the name of our Lord
[2:10:13] Jesus Christ.
[2:10:16] I stand here
[2:10:18] uh I'm very happy because
[2:10:23] God has been good. Uh what is here is
[2:10:28] one of our supply products.
[2:10:32] Uh we made some partnership with Mahhati
[2:10:36] Medical Industries
[2:10:38] though we are still in negotiation but
[2:10:41] they already started giving [music] us
[2:10:42] supplies to our company Marinate Medical
[2:10:46] and Dental Supplies. So we decided
[2:10:50] we bring a sample for dedication
[2:10:53] before we start doing our supplies. God
[2:10:57] bless you.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; Hospitals.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; So uh these medical supplies goes to
[2:11:04] hospitals.
[2:11:07] Yeah. So yeah and clinics.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; No not pharmacies.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; Okay. So I think uh it's this is an
[2:11:16] indication that uh the brother and you
[2:11:21] know his company believe that the
[2:11:23] blessing does not come from knowing how
[2:11:25] to make money but it comes from the
[2:11:26] Lord.
[2:11:31] And I am a strong believer in that.
[2:11:34] So let us all go to the Lord in prayer.
[2:11:38] our loving Jesus.
[2:11:40] We know that this is not just something
[2:11:42] we are doing. [music]
[2:11:45] But Lord, we are doing it because we
[2:11:47] believe
[2:11:49] that the Bible says whosoever cometh to
[2:11:51] God
[2:11:52] must believe that he is
[2:11:55] a rewarder of those diligent.
[2:11:58] Father, whatever we need of you, you
[2:12:02] promise to give us. It's not only
[2:12:04] spiritual blessings but also physical
[2:12:06] blessings and Lord one of ours here
[2:12:09] brother Joseph
[2:12:11] and his company Lord has got this sample
[2:12:14] of the product
[2:12:16] supplying in different hospitals clinics
[2:12:21] Lord he needs your grace if you do not
[2:12:24] go with him he knows he cannot prosper
[2:12:28] father we are asking and sanctioning
[2:12:29] your favor
[2:12:31] upon these products
[2:12:33] Lord that you will go before him and
[2:12:35] you'll make a way for him and you'll
[2:12:37] give him favor before men that your name
[2:12:40] shall be glorified. May you make this
[2:12:42] prosperous for him and Lord after it it
[2:12:46] [music] is prosperous. Then you'll come
[2:12:48] back here and give a testimony before
[2:12:51] the congregation of
[2:12:53] what you have done. Lord we give you
[2:12:55] praise because we believe it is done in
[2:12:58] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen.
