we are able to meet and fellowship with many Believers from across Europe and the [Music] US Australia and other countries Australia so this evening we are just going to read from the book of Genesis chapter 19 uh vers 15 amen we reading from vers 15 and when the morning arose and the angels Hast hastened Lord saying arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city and while he lingered the man laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the Lord being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him without the [Music] city and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said Escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed and Lord said unto them oh not so my Lord behold now thy servant has found Grace in thy sight and thou Hast uh magnify thy mercy which thou Hast showed unto me in saving my life and I cannot escape to the mountain lest some evil take me and I die behold now this city is near to flee unto and it is is a little one or let me escape th it is not a little one and my soul shall [Music] leave [Music] and he said unto him see I have accepted thee concerning this thing also that I will not overthrow the city for the which thou H has spoken H thee escap thether for I cannot do anything till thou become th therefore the name of the city was called Z [Music] amen may God bless the reading of the word you may be seated amen I heard the song leader asking the people who were behind to come in front I notice many are either hiding behind the pillars or standing sitting really behind some you see me you come and occy the chair this side over over in front here amen and you you are even a minister we don't need to always sit in front here amen praise God I'm happy to see different ones tonight I know brother Dixon went back to do his third is

Amen brother Solomon do you love me I love you I love everyone praise the name of the Lord amen and all those of you who are hiding behind the camera we also love you we love you you know sometimes we hear from you it's always nice when we hear from you and you know we know that you are there I was impressed when I was in uh Switzerland uh how many people came to me and uh mentioned how you know our services are a blessing to them there I I was surprised you know sometimes there are more that listen to to to you know the services that are on the internet than we actually thought that they were I did not I I thought I did not have difficulty or even I did not have the trouble of introducing myself to anyone there yeah so because I noticed that there are many people who maybe from time to time get to to you know check in in our Channel and follow us and hear what the Lord is doing on this side amen amen praise the name of the Lord the Lord is good more I would say on that but time is fast just to go to the word but uh greetings from everyone amen is that you brother Ian God bless you God bless you am I whose name have I not mentioned oh I said all the young men praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah don't mind me I'm just happy to be back home am so I'm going to speak on the message Escape for your life hopefully it will be short and then we will go to prayer I just feel to for spend some time in prayer the Lord willing tonight so um I I love the scripture that we ended with the verses that we ended with here where he says uh when the angel of course we know that it began with the god meeting the the Abraham when the Three Angels went to meet Abraham and of course one of them we know was the Lord and the two went to Sodom and gomorra now lot was Abra Abraham's uh brother brother and you remember time came when God when God called Abraham Abraham went with Lord and because Abraham went with lot God did not appear again to Abraham and many times in our life we take many Lots with us you know the Lord here is talking about the excesses in life that God did not need to get you from the place where you were to the place where he wants and many times we hold on them because of our relationship and time that we've spent with it and we kind of things that we cannot do without those things sometimes it is even people in our life that we want to hold on and tie ourself on and we think that we cannot do without them let me begin right there and tell you that you can you can do without anyone you did not hear that I said you can do without anyone but you cannot do without God so we notice that you see Abraham tied himself with Lord and Abraham had a good reason for that because lot lot was his cousin he was a son of his uncle and uh and uh you know he noticed that uh you know he was a son of um his uncle his brother brother his brother yes yes and and so um we notice that the father of Lord had died and I want you to imagine you have your cousin and his father is dead and and your father is also dead and now now you you God tells you to move from one place to go to a far country it is difficult for you to just abandon your family so you would feel it is only fair to go with them so there are certain things that when God called you you thought you felt pity for some of those things and you wanted to go with them and you wanted to carry them with you maybe it is a little bit heavier maybe it is a little habit maybe it is something small not so big and you felt P for that thing and he wanted it to go with you and you were right here complaining a lot that God is not speaking to you you are not going to the next level you're struggling with you want to hear the voice of God you are hearing people you know giving testimonies how God visits them and how God has spoken to them but when it comes to you you've not experienced that well I tell you it is because of that La that you have kept in your life and sometimes it comes to that moment where we need to let go of Lord when you let go of Lord then you are ready to from God but if you hold on to Lord the longer you hold on to him the longer you will wait to hear from the from you see you know you know time came when Abraham had to make a decision and Abraham said to Lord you know now my brother you are going to choose the place where you are going to go you are going to either choose to go north and if you choose North I will go south if you choose if you choose East I go looked around everywhere was Village and when he looked the other side I think it was south or something like that he saw a beautiful city he told his brother let me go to that City lot loved cities but you know many times cities are synonymous with sin that is true City C is usually and civilization is synonymous with sin because this is not God is civilization God civilization is coming in the millennium ciz calls it saten all the construction projects the money the aircraft you know the big farmer Industries and schools and you know brother bam says it's all of the devil so really what we what we know as good life most of it or all of it today is controlled by Satan where are the big monies you're going to find it in politics you're going to find it in big Industries I've had I've had many believers who have had to quit certain jobs because they felt they were being compromised some of them were threatened you cannot stay here and you don't do what I tell you to do sometimes you know even their bosses they top bosses they will tell them you know you have to do it this way yes I know it is supposed to be 10,000 but I want you to sign for 50,000 and if you don't then it's going to be difficult with you here and and this is the systems that we have the whole thing is red to the you know that life and the world as we know it let me tell it is going to come to a time where it will be very difficult for a true genuine believer comfortably live in this world I believe this is where it is hied you know um you know the world as we see it as you know we know it is setting us up for a trap our home is not here our home is above and the real true Sons and Daughters of God not be seeing how you know to build and stay here how to accumulate and stay here they should be trying to look to see how we should work him in our salvation with fear and trembling that we will get out of here there are people who are ready to do anything and everything to attain this world the world's riches the money in the world the good life as they call it the good life what is good life is it eating four meals a day or three meals a day is it traveling the world what is your definition of good life you know is it having you know many girlfriends many boyfriends you know doing the things that the world the people in the world do the world has its own definition of what good life is but I will tell you good life is receiving the word of God in its entirety accepting the word of God and submitting yourself to it l when we submit ourself to the word it means we are ready to change everything and anything in our life to align ourself with the word of God the heart that God loves the heart that is willing to escape the heart that is willing to run whenever God comes down God isg God has never God is urgent urgent whenever God comes down isent get it you didn't get it you didn't get it Argent is like he's is not [Music] slothful exactly he is always urgent you know he doesn't come you know slowly and you know somewhere I want you to come and I want you I want to take you to heaven you bring you bring your and then God and then God takes SL is taking to Heaven whenever God comes down to any of us he comes to snatch us out he comes to snatch us out that's why the Rapture is going to be a snatching away the is going to be a catching away it's not a SL taking away it's not a SL of a change of the body the Bible tells us the Rapture is a you know a change of the body in the twinkling of an eye in the twinkling of ey if you are not changed if you not escaped if you have not been making yourself ready you will not go in the Rapture you will find that you left behind let me tell you it's all about running for your life it's not about escaping for your life amen going in Rapture is the greatest Escape there has ever been why Escape because where you are the devil wants you to stay there where you are the world wants you to stay there the people wants you to stay there life wants you to stay there wants you to stay there where you are but serving God inture is escap is an escape let me tell you each of us is struggling to escape are you hearing me now praise the name of the Lord amen I'm struggling to escape you are struggling to escape amen if you you play around with your demons if you play around with the spirits that are you every day you will be left behind the reason why we leave our beds and come in the church at night we escaping for our Liv it's not a joke Christianity is not a joke it's not a joking matter and a you it's not playing Church meing business I'm going to show you something here amen that amen salvation and serving God is escaping for your life Escape is not something you just do Escape you have to plan it Escape you have to know what you're doing esape you have to know where you are going esape you have to know what you're losing you have to know what you're running away from you have to know what your heart desires you also have to know the consequences there are many consequences but you are ready for whatever will come how many are ready for whatever will come you to escape for your life am I preaching to Believers this night and so when God told Abraham go away from your people God meant it and Abraham is and but he went with Lord and when we reached somewhere with Lord and they decided to to separate it was painful for Abraham sometimes you have to painfully separate from people and from things because if you do not you cannot Escape can I have somebody saying Amen to it is it has to be painful not you have to make up your mind you have to agree with yourself and agree with the word of God to separate yourself and he told he told he told he told uh you know his brother his cousin go whever and he chose the city and later on we see you know this man loved City so much but let's let's follow it along here so after after Abraham you know met rather met with the angel he made a deal you know Abraham was telling God you know you cannot destroy that City you know Abraham rather God revealed everything he was planning to do to Abraham Abraham is the type of the bride and let me tell you there is nothing that God can do and will do to the world without fast revealing it to the bride we are his beloved and everything major that will happen he has revealed to the bride first so the Rapture is not going to happen when I'm still here I will know when it is happening and I will go why because I'm his bride and we see that Lord Abraham got a chance to know everything it was Abraham that was interceding for the people in Sodom we are the people that must intercede for the people inia that is why we are here we must intercede for our Des maybe the someone why did God destroy Sodom because there was someone why is the rapture not happening today because there is someone out there what are you doing about it the is not happening because God knows there is someone there and when someone is still there that is supposed to be in here the Rapture will not happen it doesn't matter how much you are ready the rapor will not happen until everyone that was predestinated will come out and who is to intercede for them the bride us we intered by prayer amen that's why the prayer of Believers must always include interceding and praying for the unbelievers praying for the sinners praying for those who have rejected the word praying for the people in the denominations praying for those who canot accept the word let me tell you we are in a final it is real friends I can even say that because I've been in Europe this he said that the son came from the East and on to the west and from the west back to the east again are you hearing me and that's how salvation was came from the East went to the West North America Europe and all we talk we read about missionaries here how many studed about missionar you did not brother you missed school that day you know that did you hear any Manda missionary all Europe these Europeans were the first receive the Gospel they received the Gospel Light but and then on to America and then from there you know came back down here again the East again you can now see the message you know from Israel who was the first Angel messenger Paul Israel from the east on to Europe you remember all the other Messengers you know Iranians you know Martin Luther and Martin all the way from there who was the last Angel messenger William Bram the US you know and the Far West and then from down there the message began to spread all over the world and it's going back to Israel that's the last point and Ethiopia is one of those last points the utmost parts of the earth you know that's you know and message let me tell you Ethiopia is one of the countries on Earth since the days of our last Angel message years they did not know this message this one of the last countries on Earth that is receiving this message and where is it it is going back to East going back to East and what happens in the to the West our Prophet said that the Revival was over there over finished People Are Hard Hearted they can no longer receive the message they can no longer receive Christ I asked a few Brothers do you rece I asked one brother said do you receive people like coming straight from the world into theage he say not as I know I know some backslider who and they came they do not have time even these big churches they closing down you know they don't have time for God anymore they don't have the hunger The Thirst it's not because they are so bad it is because the window there is closing closed almost and what about this side we having many coming into but let me tell you we are also seeing the last ones coming in brother bam said the last one would be from the colored people the Africans let me tell you we are seeing the last of it the last of it salvation is closing door to to Grace is closing is only a little Grace left whereby the door is about to close we don't have time for playing anymore if we are going to be Believers let us me because the Bible says when the door is closed you see what happens that is filthy be filthy still let him that Holy is ho be holy there is no more salvation no more Grace but now there is only a little Grace the door and the window is closing closing fast but who is interceding for the the bride is supposed to intercede for the S the Believers those who know God know Christ was prophesied to be called you know blind naked and they don't know this our generation was prophesied that there would be the most confused generation I want you to check yourself and I want you to examine your life and answer this question are you lukewarm or you are not and if you're lukewarm then you realize you have found yourself in but listen we have received a message to call us out of the loop of we have received message run for your life for your life it's not a very sluggish message it is a message on fire it is a message calling for life out of Darkness out of death if we believe this message we should keep the standard of the message we should show the world we are different if we need we believe this message no matter how the devil presses on us we should not give up on the word we not give up on God let fight you when you are fighting back don't accept defeat don't accept to surrender Escape for your life this moment of your life Escape don't allow the devil to put in a depression don't allow the devil to put you in fear don't allow the devil to BU you in sin don't allow theil to make you cold if you feel you have cold and you can't PR then it is time to go for fasting and prayer get on fire with God don't accept yourself to a stoop so long where the devil will play with you CH he will play with you hide and seek and you comfortable let me tell you I have a plan for you and the plan tonight is escape don't stay there don't stay there the bride amen like Abraham he was not at peace he was not about to settle for less his heart was going to the Sinners your heart must go to the Sinners even when you see a brother sister in the church he can't get it he's confused he's Bound by sin don't don't accept that situation for you go on your knees for them begin praying for them let me tell you God wants us to go into that situation where we can intercede for others [Music] Abraham said what if there is 50 if there is not destroy I want you to imagine a city city with all the money and all the and everything but even then there was not 50 believers do you think there were no churches there there were not 50 believer there were not believer almost nobody even those that came out because of the mercy of God praise the name of the Lord let me tell you is the same the Bible says that it was it was in the days of Lord so shall it be so shall it in the days of the coming of the let me tell you we are back again in those days is coming to a place where there is almost no Believers coming to a place almost where there is nobody willing to stand for the purity of the word coming to a place whereby churches are dead the people are called they such and indifference when they meet they don't talk about God anymore when they meet they don't talk about salvation anymore they are not excited by the word anymore when they come to church they're waiting for the time when the preacher will stop preaching so they can go and use their social media when they come to church their mind is outside church when they come to church think about God Amen what what is happening the B say they would be head they would be high minded be lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God listen to me brother You Must Escape for your life are you hearing me you must escape for your life we must not be part of we must not be a part of it fire is coming down are you hearing me fire is coming down whether you believe it or not coming because there is a prophecy Amen in this Bible that I believe that is going to burn the world with fire again and the people's ears are closed their hearts are dead they can't hear and that's why says blessed are you if you hear and if you believe and do the things that are it's not easy you have to escape f are you hearing me young man are you hearing me young lady you have to escape you have to escape it's a battle it's a fight you have to escape amen if you don't escape there is no other way praise God and so when the morning arose the Angels hasted Lord are you hearing me I am an angel to you tonight the prophet of God says what is an angel he says he a messenger get the dictionary and find out what an angel means some of them is Heavenly Messengers some of them is Earthly Messengers that God dwells in to bring his Earthly message and The Messengers of the Lord Messengers to you and they're standing there with their hands out to obey what God says they lay hands on the sick and they shall recover it has to happen doesn't it do you believe that every one of you coming through now listen when the angel of the Lord comes he is a messenger he's only there to fulfill and Obey What God Says and there is time to preach salvation there time to preach healing time to preach Miracles I'm obeying God if I do but also it is time Amen to preach Escape that is part of the message when these angels went down to Sodom oh hear me tonight they also did some Miracles but they did not only do Miracles they also had a message to Lord said Lord Escape for your life when they went down there to Sodom you know these men were all PS and they came to them and he said we want those men we want those we want those men the Angels the men of Sodom wanted the men the angels that came and do you know there was no female angel there is no female angel that's what the Bible says well that's a subject for another day so they said we want those we want those men and they said well you can't have them my daughters they are virgins they were not willing to know whether they are virgins or not it's just like our generation that's not longer a big deal but to God and to the word it is a big deal are you hearing me tonight amen it used to be that a girl was sacred and she always was living in fear and respect of her own body to preserve it for her husband but these days they no longer living in fear about those things because it's no longer a big deal but God is not old fashioned the Bible tells me it's the same yesterday yesterday today he never changes are you hearing me tonight and so when the Angels Came Down the man said give us them and he said I can't but maybe you can have my daughters said no we want this man and then the Angels came out they said if you want us here we are so as they came out the Bible says they struck those men blind God is into the business of sending angels God still sends angels still sends Angels the same angels that will make you escape the same angels that will show you the way of ese there a message we blind some people on this Earth thank God for the seventh angel thank God for William bram's message because his message it has opened our eyes he has showed us the way of ES way it has blinded other people's eyes those living in Sodom he and read the message the more blind they get but I thank God for this message that has opened my eyes to see to know what God is doing in my day hallelujah praise God praise God praise the name of the Lord this message has show us the way of and and this angel came down and he said arise take your wife take your two daughters which are here oh let me tell you I don't know about you but like Joshua said as for me and my house we shall serve the Lord serve god with your wife to you that are married serve god with your wife if you're going to a prayer meeting go with your wife escape with her escape with your children escape with everybody that's why even at night you know when we try to come to church we can't leave any of them we carry them to church let's go because I mean if you don't do it the devil will do it for you praise God the angel said hasten you your wife your two daughters God knows even how many children you have Hallelujah think about Where Your Children Are is it the perfect will of God for them to be out of the presence escape with them escape with them escape with them pray for them intercede for them preach to them bring them in the house of God minister to them even when you have to take them to school I always thought think about their soul always think about their soul especially to you young people that are getting into family getting into marriage and having children of course you will have to take them to school think about their soul doesn't the Bible say so doesn't the say so think about him first and his righteous and the rest you will think about their soul will they be able to attend church at least once a week will they be able to you know how is the environment where I'm taking how are they going to be spiritually think about your children because you have to escape with them brother B told us we are going to be there with all that we love and all that ever loved us we're going to be there hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my God we're going to be there with everything so certainly if you're a child of God you have loved what God Lov but if you love what God doesn't love you will be somewhere with what you love where will that be ask yourself that question got you thinking he says come with all your wife your daughters and everything let St be consumed in the iniquity of the there is Iniquity in the city there is Iniquity in the country there is Iniquity in the world there is Iniquity everywhere and while he lingered the man laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters oh may God lay his hand upon every one of our family members amen amen God send the angel of the Lord they don't come for joking they come to a snatch you they come to snatch you out that's why sometimes preachers have to bring a spanking to shake you up a little bit and snatch you out of your life out of your backsliding life where it will bring you to sobriety and they brought him forth and set him without City and it came to pass when they had brought him forth abroad and then he said Escape for your life turn your neighbor and tell them escap for your tell them loudly Escape for your life oh one more time if you have no neighbor walk to them and tell them for your life come on come on everybody now Escape for your life that is the message I have for everyone tonight Escape for your life fire is coming down fire is coming down this may be the last message you will ever hear after tonight the Rapture may happen if you are there still joking saying I'll come back on Sunday this may be the last message Noah preached the last message and then the rains came down and then the the doors were closed and then mercy was over let me tell you we shall not preach forever time will come and the last message shall be preed if you're still lingering saying I will make myself right tomorrow I I'll be okay maybe next week maybe on Sunday let me tell you this may be your last message even if the Rapture may not happen tomorrow or tonight you may die before then how many hearing me tonight so it comes to a place where you have to be on your on the edge of your seat saying I must make my life right I must be ready for his coming do we do we believe in the Rapture how many believe in the Rapture tonight if you believe in the Rapture friends let me tell you it is happening anytime soon and when a Rapture happens those you have been playing Church Jing around you will realize this too late and then you will cry and then you will wa the Bible says song a what a

heart well then cry and Shout repent of your sins let me tell you if you know this Bible very well anybody and everyone walked into the presence of God they felt so little they felt like they were Sinners they began crying and shouting they fell down some of them they bow down you know they rose up their hand because they were before the and this man in hell he cried that was the right thing to

prayers now like you are dying now [Music] pray your prayers now pray your prayers now and he said I pray thee I beg you I pray thee father that you would send him to my father's tell him to go to my father's house because I have five brothers there how many brothers do you have how many sisters do you have do they know the message are they Believers are they going to heaven with you if not there's a problem with your experience don't rest until they all know let them refuse by their own not a preacher bring them to church if they can't come to church come call us we shall go to that's why God called us come call us we will go to them and we shall preach the message to them if they refuse it's up to them we've done our part you have done your part but before you do your part you cannot sit comfortably you see I have five brothers I want you know if you can send someone my father's that he will testify to them because I don't want them to come Abraham said unto him they have Moses they have William Bram and the prophets and the preachers and their pastors let them hear them if you don't hear what I'm preaching to you God will not send an angel to you I am to you now there's no other angel coming from heaven I'm speaking to you sister no if God wants to speak to you sends a man your brother the question is will you hear say he's preaching that because he knows me that's up to you it's up to you God has his way of working he sends a man from your people from among your people and he says if he said and he said n Father Abraham but if one went out unto them from the dead they will repent this man is saying my brother's hearts are very hard but if they see someone coming from the [Music] dead who if the ground would open and Moses comes out even the one who was doing you be the first to see the that's what Lazarus that's what the man was saying those people are hard Hearts send someone from hell if you can't hear me if an angel came from Heaven you can't if your heart is so hard that preachers will preach and you can't change even if Jesus himself came here you can never change losing your heart if they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will they be pers through the one that Rose from thead I love to continue but at this moment I want us to think about those words it's time for us to escape for our life it's time for us to be more prayer more dedicated to God and the work of God how many would say Lord remember me let us stand on our feet oh you have to escape for your life or you know Escape for your life it's time of prayer if you
