[1:51:19] you nice to see you also there's a
[1:51:22] brother where is
[1:51:25] IRAs you can
[1:51:26] stand brother IRAs has been in
[1:51:31] masa for for I don't know how many
[1:51:34] years but he's now joined here as at
[1:51:41] DF receive
[1:51:45] him amen amen so this morning I'm
[1:51:49] speaking on a
[1:51:51] subject God still has a
[1:51:57] plan if you are spiritual you already
[1:51:59] know God is going to
[1:52:02] speak them God still has a
[1:52:06] plan God still has a
[1:52:09] plan all right turn to your left again
[1:52:11] and tell another
[1:52:12] one God still has a
[1:52:15] plan Hallelujah God still has a plan
[1:52:18] this
[1:52:20] morning praise the Lord God called
[1:52:23] Jonah God does not regret of his
[1:52:27] decisions that's a fact God does not
[1:52:31] regret of his
[1:52:33] decisions he always knows the end from
[1:52:36] the
[1:52:38] beginning he knew what Jonah's reactions
[1:52:41] and actions would
[1:52:43] be but he still called and
[1:52:47] said his
[1:52:49] confidence was in the seed
[1:52:53] that he had placed in
[1:52:55] Jon God knew me before I was even born
[1:53:00] he knew all the mistakes I would make in
[1:53:01] my
[1:53:02] life he knew my good and
[1:53:05] bad but he still called
[1:53:08] me so when we will see here when God
[1:53:13] calls he doesn't just call he calls on a
[1:53:18] certain
[1:53:21] basis
[1:53:23] God still had a plan for
[1:53:25] Jonah Jonah thought he could
[1:53:28] run he leaned upon his own
[1:53:31] understanding he went the opposite
[1:53:35] way him and S him to
[1:53:38] n but Jonah took the the Sheep to
[1:53:42] T but God still had a
[1:53:46] plan God is God a
[1:53:49] plan some of you are maybe not
[1:53:51] fulfilling the the purpose of God for
[1:53:53] your life
[1:53:56] yet you are not even in a place that God
[1:53:59] wants you to
[1:54:02] be but I have a message for you this
[1:54:04] morning God still has a plan for
[1:54:08] you God has a plan for me God has a plan
[1:54:12] for each and every one of
[1:54:14] us amen and nothing is going
[1:54:17] wrong praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:54:21] he is God somebody tell someone God is
[1:54:25] God God and he's God by
[1:54:28] himself amen he cannot share his glory
[1:54:31] with
[1:54:32] anyone God is God on the
[1:54:35] mountain God is God in the valley God is
[1:54:38] God in loss God is God when you have
[1:54:42] gain he's God when you are in sin he's
[1:54:45] God when you are in righteous he God
[1:54:48] when you are in
[1:54:49] weakness God when you are strong God
[1:54:52] when you are rich is God when you are
[1:54:56] poor God is
[1:54:58] God God is God all the
[1:55:01] time and the god that we know is a good
[1:55:05] god so this message I'm preaching about
[1:55:09] that God is God all the
[1:55:12] time and God has a plan for each and
[1:55:14] every one of
[1:55:16] us this morning you may say well I feel
[1:55:18] that I'm a
[1:55:20] sinner I feel I am worthy or I feel I do
[1:55:24] not have I can't I can't really be a Son
[1:55:27] of
[1:55:28] God I don't feel like the Rapture will
[1:55:31] come it has nothing to do with your
[1:55:34] feelings it doesn't have anything to do
[1:55:36] with the purpose of
[1:55:38] God the word of God and the promises of
[1:55:41] God is never about our
[1:55:45] feelings it has everything to do with
[1:55:47] his
[1:55:48] promises all things work together for
[1:55:51] good
[1:55:53] in the Book of Romans chter 8 verse
[1:55:56] 28 one time I was inis ABA and I read
[1:56:01] this scripture for sister
[1:56:03] yodit and if she wasn't if I wasn't who
[1:56:07] I was to her she would have slapped
[1:56:10] me because she was going through a very
[1:56:12] tough
[1:56:14] time and then I told her about sister
[1:56:16] the Bible
[1:56:17] says for all things work together
[1:56:21] for could you say
[1:56:23] that are you saying this is also for
[1:56:26] good amen and I'm smiling this morning
[1:56:30] because I believe that nothing is going
[1:56:32] wrong in each of Our
[1:56:36] Lives all works for
[1:56:40] good where is Sister
[1:56:42] Esther we thank God for
[1:56:46] preserving amen but all that was for
[1:56:49] good and we know that all things work
[1:56:51] together for good to them that love
[1:56:55] God to them who are the C according to
[1:56:58] his
[1:57:00] purpose whom he did for
[1:57:03] know he also did
[1:57:05] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:57:07] image of his
[1:57:08] son that he might be the first born
[1:57:11] among many
[1:57:12] Breen over whom he did
[1:57:15] predestinate they he also called and
[1:57:18] whom he called they also
[1:57:21] Justified because he justified they also
[1:57:24] glorify now I want you to understand
[1:57:27] today we are called according to his
[1:57:32] purpose we are here on a
[1:57:34] mission his mission cannot
[1:57:37] fail it is not my mission it is his
[1:57:42] mission through me and in me and that
[1:57:45] mission cannot
[1:57:47] fa even when bad and wicked things touch
[1:57:50] my life
[1:57:53] even when bad and wicked things touch
[1:57:55] your
[1:57:57] life his will his will always you know
[1:58:01] he through his
[1:58:03] will he will take those things that have
[1:58:05] happened in your
[1:58:07] life he will bring it to be
[1:58:11] good and he will make it good for your
[1:58:14] life and for others around
[1:58:18] you in the life of the
[1:58:20] C nothing is going
[1:58:23] wrong am I preaching to someone here
[1:58:25] this morning am I preaching to someone
[1:58:28] here this morning will if God is
[1:58:30] speaking to you don't say well you spoke
[1:58:31] to me say
[1:58:34] amen God always had a
[1:58:37] plan Those whom he did for
[1:58:40] no he
[1:58:43] predestinated so when we say that God
[1:58:45] called
[1:58:46] you there is something I want you to see
[1:58:48] this morning when we said that God
[1:58:50] called you
[1:58:52] he didn't just go around in the
[1:58:55] market and he saw and he said this one
[1:58:58] looks
[1:58:59] good and he picked you among the rest
[1:59:03] that's not how God
[1:59:05] calls his calling is not that
[1:59:09] way his calling is far
[1:59:13] reaching it is far
[1:59:15] deeper than just going in a market and
[1:59:19] picking let me show you the procedure of
[1:59:22] God to call
[1:59:25] some after you have known your mind is
[1:59:28] going to
[1:59:29] open you're going to see God in
[1:59:31] everything that
[1:59:33] happens those who he for
[1:59:37] knew so it begins with forign
[1:59:41] knowledge he knew them before they came
[1:59:43] into
[1:59:45] existence he knew them before they were
[1:59:48] born he knew them before they were in
[1:59:50] their mother's room he knew before their
[1:59:53] father and mother
[1:59:55] married knew before they did good or
[2:00:00] bad those who he
[2:00:03] for he
[2:00:06] predestinated hallelujah amen un
[2:00:10] confirmation now those he for knew he
[2:00:16] predestinated to be
[2:00:18] conformed to the image of Jesus Christ
[2:00:22] so in other words
[2:00:25] predestination means pre pre is
[2:00:30] before and
[2:00:33] destination is the
[2:00:35] end so predestination predes means he
[2:00:40] knew what would happen to them in the
[2:00:45] end and what will
[2:00:47] happen in knew it would be confirmation
[2:00:51] to the image of his
[2:00:57] son all those
[2:00:59] for he predestinated them to be into the
[2:01:03] image of
[2:01:04] Jesus so if God for me he he
[2:01:08] predestinated me to be in the perfect
[2:01:12] image of
[2:01:14] Christ nothing can stop me no disease
[2:01:17] can stop me no unfortune can
[2:01:20] stop no bad woman can
[2:01:23] stop no sin can stop nothing that
[2:01:27] happened can stop nothing in my life can
[2:01:30] stop why because God forew me and he
[2:01:35] predestinated me to be
[2:01:38] conform to the image of Jesus
[2:01:43] Christ and those he
[2:01:46] predestinated hallelujah amen those he
[2:01:50] predestinated
[2:01:52] then he calls
[2:01:55] them Hallelujah so for God to call you
[2:01:59] he had to know you
[2:02:02] before after knowing you then he
[2:02:05] predestinated you after
[2:02:08] predestin then he called you God doesn't
[2:02:11] call
[2:02:13] anybody God doesn't call
[2:02:15] everybody if I'm called I was known and
[2:02:20] he predestinated me therefore I cannot
[2:02:23] be
[2:02:24] defeated everything in my life is
[2:02:28] working
[2:02:29] out for the
[2:02:32] good and those he
[2:02:35] called the Bible says he
[2:02:40] [Music]
[2:02:41] justif hallelujah amen
[2:02:45] he he knew amen there would be Sinners
[2:02:49] he knew they would not be perfect
[2:02:52] because he for them and he predestinated
[2:02:56] them so what did he do he called them he
[2:03:00] knew they're not
[2:03:01] perfect so he said you are
[2:03:06] Justified
[2:03:09] justification
[2:03:11] means you have been
[2:03:14] condemned it is true you are a
[2:03:16] sinner but
[2:03:18] justification means you have been
[2:03:22] rendered
[2:03:25] sinless now remember this is before you
[2:03:29] were even
[2:03:32] born it's not your
[2:03:34] action it is his
[2:03:37] work when you talk about salvation and
[2:03:40] Redemption we need to look to him not to
[2:03:44] us so when he justified
[2:03:47] you it is as though you have never
[2:03:50] seen
[2:03:52] in the first
[2:03:57] place and those
[2:04:02] justifi then he
[2:04:05] glorified he
[2:04:07] glorified he
[2:04:10] glorified the world no matter what the
[2:04:12] word
[2:04:13] brings your way or my
[2:04:15] way as long as this is the process I've
[2:04:18] gone
[2:04:19] through and I believe I'm the
[2:04:24] nothing can stop me to accompl my
[2:04:26] purpose
[2:04:28] Earth and friends this has been my
[2:04:30] strength in this
[2:04:32] life many people give up and they give
[2:04:36] up so fast because they don't know how
[2:04:38] God
[2:04:39] works many of them beat themselves
[2:04:43] because they have so many imperfections
[2:04:46] in people concentrate on things that are
[2:04:49] nothing to
[2:04:50] God
[2:04:52] people concentrate on their
[2:04:54] worries they concentrate on their
[2:04:58] insufficient people concentrate on their
[2:05:02] heartbreaks people concentrate on what
[2:05:04] people did to
[2:05:06] them and when God looks at you doing
[2:05:09] that then he is so surprised why you
[2:05:13] cannot understand is not about all those
[2:05:16] things it's about his
[2:05:19] love is about his for
[2:05:22] it's about those he
[2:05:24] call about his ability to
[2:05:28] justify to
[2:05:31] glorify God has glorified you no man can
[2:05:35] put you
[2:05:36] down God Has Lifted you up not demon not
[2:05:40] Spirit
[2:05:41] not wied force can bring you down
[2:05:46] nothing you can do to somebody somebody
[2:05:48] can do to you that will bring you
[2:05:50] down
[2:05:53] why because there is a greater
[2:05:55] power we are not
[2:05:57] alone there is a greater power that
[2:06:01] determines our Liv that determines our
[2:06:04] destiny and our Destin is
[2:06:07] clear it is fashioned in the hands of
[2:06:10] God he even said father all those you
[2:06:14] have given me they are mine and I will
[2:06:18] lose none of
[2:06:19] them Hallelujah am you need to
[2:06:22] understand it is not about you it is
[2:06:25] about him and he said they all in the
[2:06:29] pal my hand Oh Glory to God if you in
[2:06:34] the palm of the of God you cannot be
[2:06:37] lost you cannot go to hell you cannot be
[2:06:41] destroyed your soul is
[2:06:45] eternal just like God is
[2:06:48] eternal you are born to leave live
[2:06:52] eternally nothing
[2:06:54] happen can
[2:06:56] determine your
[2:06:58] destiny because God has already
[2:07:01] determined
[2:07:02] your from
[2:07:05] eternity you came from
[2:07:07] God go back to
[2:07:11] God
[2:07:13] Amen we need to understand
[2:07:18] this when you understand
[2:07:20] this you are going to
[2:07:23] stop being so defeated in your
[2:07:28] mind and many
[2:07:30] people don't actually
[2:07:33] overcome because they live in a life
[2:07:35] that is
[2:07:37] defeated a life that is
[2:07:40] sorry they can't even pray because of
[2:07:44] what I did they can't even do anything
[2:07:47] they can't even serve God I am
[2:07:50] nothing whenever God looks at you
[2:07:53] that what's WR with
[2:07:55] this
[2:07:57] understand understand that have called
[2:08:00] him that have predestinated him that
[2:08:03] have loved him that have Justified him
[2:08:06] glorified him it's not about him it's
[2:08:08] about me I have a plan it is not his
[2:08:12] plan it is my plan it is not your plan
[2:08:16] God his plan about your
[2:08:20] life
[2:08:22] I wanted to preach on something
[2:08:24] else but this
[2:08:26] morning these words came to me so strong
[2:08:29] in
[2:08:30] my I believe it is an inspiration which
[2:08:32] will bless
[2:08:35] someone no matter what you're going
[2:08:37] through in your
[2:08:38] life good or bad listen to me
[2:08:42] carefully Hallelujah now when God called
[2:08:46] somebody he says I'll be with you now
[2:08:49] one time God Called Moses
[2:08:52] and mes was so sorry he didn't want to
[2:08:54] go because of many reasons but God
[2:08:57] called him and God used him time came
[2:09:02] when Moses died and there was another
[2:09:04] one that God called his name was
[2:09:09] Joshua now Joshua was a person that
[2:09:13] believed in God but even when Moses
[2:09:17] died God still had a
[2:09:20] plan
[2:09:22] I want you to
[2:09:23] see you may dwell on blaming
[2:09:27] Moses for heting the The
[2:09:32] Rock and was
[2:09:34] wrong scripturally and all this was
[2:09:38] supposed
[2:09:40] to but all worked for
[2:09:43] good God had it in
[2:09:46] plan had it in mind I not going to
[2:09:49] justify any wrong doing
[2:09:53] but I want to justify this
[2:09:55] morning the plan and purpose of God for
[2:09:57] your
[2:09:59] life even in
[2:10:02] wrongdoing even in
[2:10:05] wrongdoing he uses them to glorify and
[2:10:09] lift his purpose in your
[2:10:11] life so we should not
[2:10:14] dwell on what has
[2:10:17] happened
[2:10:19] us ahead of us
[2:10:22] around us to defeat the purpose of
[2:10:26] God we should dwell on him that called
[2:10:31] us if God called me then he knew I am
[2:10:35] perfect he knew I'm the man for
[2:10:38] the he knew even the demons of Hell
[2:10:41] cannot
[2:10:42] defeat because I am not here on my own I
[2:10:46] am here on Earth on Divine
[2:10:49] assignment the devil can K me
[2:10:53] even my Divine assignment has been
[2:10:58] accomplished when John was
[2:11:01] born the devil wanted to kill him but no
[2:11:05] one could touch
[2:11:07] him until the assignment that God gave
[2:11:11] him was completed now God allowed them
[2:11:15] to
[2:11:16] kill I don't care how I die I don't you
[2:11:19] shouldn't care how we die
[2:11:22] whether is through an accident or
[2:11:24] through sickness or through pain and
[2:11:26] suffering it doesn't matter what matters
[2:11:30] is I cannot die until my assignment on
[2:11:34] Earth has been
[2:11:37] accomplished I do not live in
[2:11:39] fear of death each time because I know
[2:11:44] death can hear death can hear and when
[2:11:50] God speaks
[2:11:52] death can
[2:11:53] flee because death cannot stand before a
[2:11:56] child
[2:11:58] of finished his Divine
[2:12:02] ass Hallelujah I have a Divine
[2:12:06] ass I have souls to redeem I have souls
[2:12:10] to preach I have wherever God wanted me
[2:12:13] to
[2:12:13] go that's why I don't fear
[2:12:16] flying I don't fear driving long
[2:12:18] Journeys I don't fear walking long
[2:12:20] Journeys
[2:12:21] if I know God sent me
[2:12:23] somewhere I go anyhow because I know I
[2:12:26] am on Divine
[2:12:28] assignment same thing with you do not
[2:12:31] fear what man can do don't look at man
[2:12:35] don't look at what the devil can
[2:12:37] do look at your Divine
[2:12:41] assignment let me tell you some men who
[2:12:45] can walk so close to
[2:12:47] God God will reveal to you your divine
[2:12:52] assignment that is what we call
[2:12:56] purpose when men walk on this
[2:12:59] Earth without a sense of
[2:13:02] purpose without knowing their assignment
[2:13:05] on
[2:13:06] Earth they will always live defeated
[2:13:10] life but when you know your
[2:13:13] purpose you do not fear but those men
[2:13:18] women they go be wiing others because of
[2:13:24] fear they hate others because of fear
[2:13:29] they Envy others because of
[2:13:32] fear all those things are because of
[2:13:36] fear but when you know your

[2:13:58] you in the palm of the and you must
[2:14:01] accomplish a
[2:14:02] purpose if God speaks to you and he
[2:14:05] says like he spoke to Abraham leave this
[2:14:09] place and go to that
[2:14:10] place when you arrive at that when you
[2:14:13] start out your journey you have no
[2:14:16] fear about the night or the day or the
[2:14:20] darkness because you know you trust in
[2:14:23] him who called you he has a purpose and
[2:14:28] his purpose shall be
[2:14:30] accomplished the good work he has
[2:14:32] started in
[2:14:33] me will be
[2:14:35] accomplished and nothing can
[2:14:46] hinder and Moses
[2:14:49] died and then he came to Joshua and he
[2:14:51] said I'll be with
[2:14:53] you I want you to look at Joshua 1
[2:14:58] ver4 you could open that in the in vers
[2:15:01] vers
[2:15:04] four from the Wilderness and this
[2:15:07] Lebanon even unto the Great River the
[2:15:09] river ephes all the land of the he
[2:15:12] titites and unto the great sea toward
[2:15:14] the going down of the sun shall be your
[2:15:19] cost
[2:15:24] [Music]
[2:15:35] friends I wanted to hear me
[2:15:38] clearly open your spiritual
[2:15:40] ears sit on the edge of your seat this
[2:15:44] morning except
[2:15:46] do to feel tired because I'm about to
[2:15:49] give you utterances
[2:15:51] through the word of
[2:15:53] God which will make you see your future
[2:15:59] clear I want you to see this when God
[2:16:02] came down
[2:16:04] to he spoke to him and he said you know
[2:16:08] from this Great
[2:16:10] River to the
[2:16:12] Sea will be your
[2:16:14] cost now
[2:16:17] today um the the Palestinians
[2:16:21] they even have a chant they usually
[2:16:23] chant when they are you know mobilizing
[2:16:24] people to come and fight against
[2:16:28] Israel that free
[2:16:31] Palestine from the
[2:16:34] river to the sea free Palestine because
[2:16:38] according to them and that's why it is
[2:16:40] not possible to solve the Israel
[2:16:44] Palestine question by
[2:16:47] politics this is a Divine thing
[2:16:51] you know God gave to Israel the son the
[2:16:56] son the children of Isaac through
[2:16:58] Ibraham he gave them we see it done here
[2:17:02] in the Book of
[2:17:03] Joshua from The
[2:17:05] River To The Sea he said that is your C
[2:17:10] that is your portion that is your land
[2:17:13] now Palestine also says that is all our
[2:17:17] land and so each of the cannot be
[2:17:22] satisfied with a
[2:17:24] portion and Israel cannot also be
[2:17:26] satisfied with a
[2:17:28] portion they want it
[2:17:32] all but I'm not going to speak about it
[2:17:34] politically I'm going to speak the
[2:17:37] scripture God gave it to
[2:17:40] Israel it is their promise that's why at
[2:17:43] this current time you notice God has
[2:17:46] given those men a
[2:17:49] resolve presid uh prime minister
[2:17:52] netan you know he said no matter what

[2:18:03] Mas and we are going to to restore piece
[2:18:07] or whatever it is but you see these
[2:18:10] people are behind
[2:18:12] prophecy you know if God promised it to
[2:18:15] isra it is for Israel even if the whole
[2:18:19] of Africa all of Europe all of Americans
[2:18:23] come against Israel Israel cannot be

[2:33:19] people don't keep
[2:33:21] walking when they slide a
[2:33:24] bit they give
[2:33:26] up and then God gives up
[2:33:30] because Jonah was in the will of
[2:33:33] God let us look this quot in the
[2:33:36] messenger greater than Solomon is
[2:33:40] here now look at Jonah many people think
[2:33:43] that Jonah was a terrible
[2:33:46] person Jonah was a prophet of the Lord
[2:33:50] walking in all the will of the
[2:33:53] Lord you say why did he not do what he
[2:33:56] did why did he do what he
[2:33:59] did he never done anything contrary to
[2:34:02] God's
[2:34:08] will you know God told Jonah go n
[2:34:13] he and the prophet is saying Jonah was
[2:34:17] in the will of God
[2:34:21] you say why did he do what he
[2:34:23] did he never did anything contr to God's
[2:34:28] way you can't if you are in
[2:34:33] Christ you cannot do anything contrary
[2:34:36] if you're walking
[2:34:39] humbly it may seem like you
[2:34:43] do but you don't do
[2:34:46] it nothing happens
[2:34:48] providential
[2:34:50] the footsteps of a righteous man is
[2:34:51] ordered of the
[2:34:53] LA and all things work together for the
[2:34:56] good to them that love
[2:34:58] him how can you take those
[2:35:01] scriptures and compare them with any
[2:35:05] other and then break
[2:35:08] them the scriptures cannot be
[2:35:12] broken nothing going wrong in my
[2:35:15] life think about your life as long as
[2:35:19] you the the Lord of
[2:35:22] course are you called of the Lord right
[2:35:26] everybody nothing going
[2:35:31] wrong everything is going in the perfect
[2:35:34] way of
[2:35:37] God or you say he took a sheep and went
[2:35:40] to touch
[2:35:43] it instead of
[2:35:45] n when God sent him to
[2:35:48] Neve and want to tou let's just look at
[2:35:52] it a few
[2:35:53] minutes find out it's the way you look
[2:35:56] at
[2:35:58] it it's the way you look at
[2:36:02] it you run over the top of them and say
[2:36:05] oh you are
[2:36:08] a I would like to be
[2:36:10] one i' like to be a
[2:36:13] j suddenly he was a man of
[2:36:17] God what is the prophet saying
[2:36:20] that Jonah was a man of God and he says
[2:36:23] he would like to be a
[2:36:25] Jonah why because Jonah was walking in
[2:36:28] the perfect will
[2:36:31] of why Jonah was
[2:36:35] assigned learn something here
[2:36:38] today in the of the sign of this
[2:36:40] time many people condemn
[2:36:43] Jonah I do not
[2:36:46] condemn you know they say well he's a j
[2:36:51] you you've you've had that
[2:36:54] expression but you must not do
[2:36:57] that
[2:36:59] Christians you shouldn't condemn God's
[2:37:06] servants I remember when I I first
[2:37:08] believe this
[2:37:10] message I was a very hot
[2:37:13] head I you know I I I of course I
[2:37:17] believe in Holiness and righteousness so
[2:37:19] when I see someone doing
[2:37:22] something I quickly go to them and I
[2:37:24] condemn
[2:37:25] them bring them down and
[2:37:27] I write emails I do this that one time
[2:37:32] there was a pastor and his name is um
[2:37:35] the late Pastor

[2:37:41] time so I heard that he had done

[2:37:44] wrong in some of the things he told or
[2:37:47] whatever some minister told me that oh I
[2:37:51] became you know so
[2:37:53] angry I quickly wrote him an email after
[2:37:56] I called him I got his number and I
[2:37:58] called him and I I began rebuking him

[2:38:58] was ding a Land
[2:39:00] Cruiser very nice car and he drove
[2:39:04] toana I was living in one little small
[2:39:08] room and when he came and I saw him and
[2:39:12] the guy was coming out I almost hid
[2:39:17] myself but he was so gracious
[2:39:20] he came in the house and he sat down and
[2:39:23] and you know he was very
[2:39:27] lovely I didn't even talk about those
[2:39:29] things

[2:39:35] he was very good and he said you can
[2:39:38] even come and visit
[2:39:40] us you're a preacher said yes so I
[2:39:43] called my P I
[2:39:46] told let me tell you friends from that
[2:39:49] day I made up my mind to respect all
[2:39:55] servants so when you see some of us do
[2:39:57] things in a certain
[2:39:59] way because you have gone through a
[2:40:02] school of
[2:40:05] experience and I have learned also other
[2:40:08] things have
[2:40:09] happened that I've learned to never be
[2:40:16] judgmental you hear
[2:40:18] words over
[2:40:20] the do you
[2:40:25] know you are going to be the
[2:40:30] devil's did you hear that is calling
[2:40:46] himself a lot of
[2:40:48] money they talked and
[2:40:51] talked were the things
[2:40:54] true
[2:40:56] yes but these people were
[2:41:00] misguided they did not know that Jonah
[2:41:02] was a prophet of
[2:41:05] God and Jonah was still working in the
[2:41:08] will of
[2:41:11] God one thing that I know
[2:41:13] friends the will of God will never take
[2:41:17] you to a place
[2:41:20] where his grace will not protect
[2:41:24] you
[2:41:25] amen sometimes the will of God will take
[2:41:29] you into
[2:41:30] pres you never want anyone to
[2:41:33] go but as long as you're walking in the
[2:41:36] word of God and you're working in his
[2:41:39] will for your
[2:41:40] life in Good Times in bad he is still
[2:41:46] God
[2:41:48] hallelujah and here he says Jonah was I
[2:41:52] do not condemn
[2:41:53] Jonah you know they say where is the
[2:41:57] Jonah you've heard that
[2:41:59] expression but he must not do that
[2:42:02] Christians you shouldn't condemn God's
[2:42:06] people Jonah was a prophet he was not
[2:42:10] out of the will of
[2:42:12] God he did just exactly he must do for
[2:42:16] for a
[2:42:18] sign
[2:42:21] everything
[2:42:23] happens not by Just
[2:42:25] [Music]
[2:42:27] Happening open your spiritual ear listen
[2:42:30] to what I'm saying this
[2:42:32] morning everything
[2:42:34] happens not by Just
[2:42:39] Happening it happens for
[2:42:43] a one time a prophet had to marry a
[2:42:48] prostitute
[2:42:50] have children by
[2:42:52] her one laid on his side for 340
[2:43:01] days then turned over on the other
[2:43:05] side one stripped his
[2:43:08] cloes and just everything did for
[2:43:13] signs God is God and God does what he
[2:43:17] wants to do
[2:43:19] God doesn't answer to no
[2:43:22] man and Jonah had to do it for a
[2:43:26] son remember Abraham had to
[2:43:31] marry against his own will when sah give
[2:43:35] the
[2:43:36] handmade but he refused it but God
[2:43:39] appeared to him and he said listen
[2:43:43] to because the free woman will not be
[2:43:46] with a B
[2:43:48] woman
[2:43:50] she had to have a child she had to had
[2:43:53] she had to have the child be cast
[2:43:57] out what was it a sign all of it is
[2:44:03] signs God does those things for
[2:44:06] sign and Jonah was a
[2:44:09] sign now if you notice Jesus refers to
[2:44:13] eat
[2:44:14] here a weak and a wicked and a dous
[2:44:18] generation
[2:44:20] will seek after a sign that they will
[2:44:23] get it for as the prophet Jonah was in
[2:44:26] the belly of the well for three days and
[2:44:28] for three days and three
[2:44:33] nights what was Jonah then a sign
[2:44:36] of he was a sign of the
[2:44:40] Resurrection hallelujah amen hallelujah
[2:44:43] am J had to
[2:44:46] disobey when God called him he knew he
[2:44:49] was going to
[2:44:51] disobey and he knew it would work for
[2:44:55] God because he wanted it to be for a
[2:44:58] sign and then he called him and the man
[2:45:01] went to touch him and in the middle of
[2:45:03] the
[2:45:04] way the
[2:45:06] boat you know gets a lot of
[2:45:09] winds and people began to throw
[2:45:12] their they didn't want to
[2:45:15] drown and then they found
[2:45:17] Jonah sleeping
[2:45:22] [Music]
[2:45:26] brother we are
[2:45:28] praying you are
[2:45:32] doing now the brothers who do in the
[2:45:35] church feel
[2:45:39] comfortable even even those in churches
[2:45:43] assigned don't divert my
[2:45:46] sermons and why the brother was do
[2:45:50] they work say
[2:45:53] brother he said me I'm going for what I
[2:45:57] know what I
[2:45:59] did the man knew
[2:46:06] what and it was God's
[2:46:11] will you know the bad things that have
[2:46:13] happened in your
[2:46:15] life things that you're not proud
[2:46:17] of
[2:46:20] this morning I will tell you God
[2:46:23] permitted it to
[2:46:26] [Applause]
[2:46:28] happen because if you are a called of
[2:46:32] God if you were the called of
[2:46:35] God you have been called for a
[2:46:39] purpose and if Jonah
[2:46:42] wanted wouldn't stop himself from going
[2:46:44] to that
[2:46:47] ship to
[2:46:50] tarish because God
[2:46:52] knew God knew that he would
[2:46:55] goish and then he knew that they would
[2:46:58] throw him
[2:47:00] into where did that fish come
[2:47:04] from think about
[2:47:07] it do we still have them today that can
[2:47:09] swallow human
[2:47:12] beings do we and a human being can live
[2:47:16] life in
[2:47:17] there
[2:47:20] three days three
[2:47:23] nights do we have
[2:47:28] such that
[2:47:30] fish was
[2:47:32] created just for that
[2:47:37] moment so God was in
[2:47:42] this and when the man went into
[2:47:45] that he started
[2:47:47] praying oh God
[2:47:52] days let me ask you as he was in the
[2:47:56] deepest
[2:47:58] H
[2:48:00] days it was a sign of the coming of the
[2:48:06] Messiah when the Messiah comes you be in
[2:48:10] the
[2:48:12] deepest days and
[2:48:17] night and when he came
[2:48:20] he
[2:48:21] resurrected and Jonah was a
[2:48:25] sign when they asked Jesus for a
[2:48:28] sign gave the sign of prophet
[2:48:31] Jon Hallelujah are you following me
[2:48:36] verse 15 of Jonah
[2:48:38] 1 so they took up Jonah and cast him
[2:48:41] forth into the sea and the seed from her
[2:48:45] raging then the man feared the Lord
[2:48:47] exceedingly
[2:48:49] and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord
[2:48:51] and made
[2:48:52] vows now the Lord had prepared a great
[2:48:54] fish to swallow up
[2:48:57] Jonah right there God prepared
[2:49:01] it imagine God preparing
[2:49:07] your and Jonah was now in the belly of
[2:49:10] the fish three days and three
[2:49:14] nights theil thought he had
[2:49:16] won but God still had a
[2:49:20] plan in the middle of the bell of the
[2:49:22] great
[2:49:24] fish was still
[2:49:27] God and he still had a
[2:49:29] plan it was not over until God said it
[2:49:35] was and I want to speak to some of you
[2:49:37] here
[2:49:38] today praise the name of the Lord you
[2:49:41] know you may also be in the middle of
[2:49:43] your
[2:49:45] fish now some of you may be in the
[2:49:47] middle of your fish
[2:49:50] I want to say God is still
[2:49:53] God still has a
[2:49:55] plan it is not over until he says it is
[2:50:00] over he's the director of this
[2:50:03] movie not over until he
[2:50:06] says never accept defeat
[2:50:10] friend even when they laugh at you don't
[2:50:13] you worry because God is in
[2:50:16] this and God still a
[2:50:20] plan praise the name of the Lord and as
[2:50:22] Jonah was right there in that deepest of
[2:50:24] the
[2:50:27] sea Jonah prayed unto the
[2:50:30] Lord and out of the fish's belly he
[2:50:34] cried because of his Affliction unto the
[2:50:37] Lord and the Bible
[2:50:40] says he was he said for thou has cast me
[2:50:43] into the
[2:50:44] deep in the midst of the
[2:50:47] Seas and they and the floods Compass me
[2:50:52] about Billows and th waves pass over
[2:50:57] me then I said I am cast out of th
[2:51:01] side I will look again
[2:51:06] Temple no matter what situation you go
[2:51:09] through in your
[2:51:10] life always look to the
[2:51:13] Lord the waters Compass me
[2:51:16] about even to the soul
[2:51:19] the depth closed around about
[2:51:21] me the weeds were wrapped about my
[2:51:26] head I went down to the bottoms of the
[2:51:30] mountains the Earth with her BS was
[2:51:32] about me
[2:51:36] forever yet hast thou brought up my life
[2:51:38] from the
[2:51:41] corruption oh Lord my God when my soul
[2:51:45] fainted within me I remember the Lord
[2:51:50] and my prayer came in unto
[2:51:52] the th Holy
[2:51:54] Temple now imagine if Jonah had decided
[2:51:57] to shut up and not
[2:52:01] pray and many of us when we are going
[2:52:03] through trials and
[2:52:06] situations we never
[2:52:09] pray many of us say I don't even feel
[2:52:11] like
[2:52:13] praying I don't feel like
[2:52:15] praying why why did God allow it I come
[2:52:18] in this
[2:52:21] situation listen I want you to
[2:52:23] understand
[2:52:24] today that God still has a
[2:52:27] plan and all things work together for
[2:52:30] the
[2:52:31] good those are called of
[2:52:34] God and and and Jonah
[2:52:36] prayed and Jonah prayed and we can pray
[2:52:40] like M prayed as
[2:52:42] well says therefore will I look unto the
[2:52:45] Lord I will wait for the god of my
[2:52:47] salvation
[2:52:49] my God will hear me Rejoice not against
[2:52:53] me or my
[2:52:54] enemy when I fall I shall
[2:52:56] AR when I sit in darkness the Lord shall
[2:53:00] be a light me I will bear the
[2:53:03] indignation of the
[2:53:05] Lord because I have sinned against him
[2:53:08] until he plead my CA and ex judgment for
[2:53:12] me he will bring me forth to the
[2:53:15] light and I Shall Behold his
[2:53:17] righteousness
[2:53:19] then she I always love this part then
[2:53:23] she that was my
[2:53:26] enemy shall see it let me pause there
[2:53:30] right a
[2:53:32] moment listen do you know your enemies
[2:53:37] play a very big role in your
[2:53:41] life how many knew
[2:53:45] that your enemies are very important
[2:53:50] that's why the says you should love
[2:53:54] them if someone threatens you or
[2:53:56] intimidates
[2:53:58] you that person is very important in
[2:54:00] your
[2:54:02] life love
[2:54:04] them because they there to to fulfill a
[2:54:06] purpose in your
[2:54:08] life let me prove that imagine God has
[2:54:13] blessed
[2:54:14] you everything you want in
[2:54:17] life but you alone in the
[2:54:21] world will you enjoy
[2:54:25] it sincerely even if you have a very
[2:54:27] good
[2:54:28] suit you won't enjoy it because no one
[2:54:31] will see
[2:54:33] it let's be
[2:54:36] realistic I'm dressed this
[2:54:39] way and I know you are seeing me and I'm
[2:54:42] happy because
[2:54:44] you because if I was in my bedroom I was
[2:54:47] not dress like this
[2:54:50] is that not
[2:54:51] true even you think it's only even you
[2:54:55] you address that way because we are
[2:54:56] seeing
[2:54:59] you and so you enjoy things when others
[2:55:04] are
[2:55:05] watching God knows that and that's why
[2:55:08] he also say I will prepare a table for
[2:55:14] you but it will have to be in the
[2:55:16] presence of your enemies
[2:55:20] because God wants
[2:55:22] it for you to love your enemies so that
[2:55:26] they can see when God lifts
[2:55:29] you your enemies will see and they will
[2:55:33] say m God Has Lifted him so love your
[2:55:37] enemies they are there for a
[2:55:40] purpose if someone never said you will
[2:55:43] never
[2:55:45] marry how would you be so happy
[2:55:48] when you're
[2:55:52] getting if someone
[2:55:55] said you will never give birth and you
[2:55:58] become pregnant even when you
[2:56:02] praying give me this
[2:56:04] pregnan so that my enemies will know I
[2:56:08] have a living
[2:56:09] God that's the prayer and then you
[2:56:13] remember even when when Moses was in the
[2:56:17] desert God was very angry with the
[2:56:20] isites he wanted to kill all of
[2:56:23] them he told Moses
[2:56:25] move
[2:56:27] K why did Moses pray oh please God don't
[2:56:31] kill them because those enemies of our
[2:56:34] they will see
[2:56:36] what and they will say they God not
[2:56:40] deliver them not fulfill his promise so
[2:56:43] leave the people for the sake of our
[2:56:47] enemies
[2:56:49] sometimes God protects you because of
[2:56:52] your enemies so your enemies are very
[2:56:57] very and that's why you should love
[2:57:01] them let God ha
[2:57:03] them by proving to them with your with
[2:57:11] blessing there are many scriptures about
[2:57:14] that there many scriptures about that
[2:57:18] how God can only bless
[2:57:20] you lift you to show your
[2:57:25] enemies the enemies play a very big
[2:57:29] role if you are if you are hting your
[2:57:32] enemies you are spending your energy
[2:57:36] bad love your
[2:57:39] enemies and sometimes it's not because
[2:57:41] you Hur
[2:57:42] them sometimes because they don't love
[2:57:45] you or like you have you ever there when
[2:57:48] you are just hated by someone for no
[2:57:52] reason someone doesn't just like
[2:57:56] you no matter what you do they just
[2:57:59] don't like you you can't change it so
[2:58:02] I'll tell you what you should do says
[2:58:04] love them by so doing putting CES of
[2:58:08] fire on
[2:58:11] their but when you fear someone to the
[2:58:15] extent that you can't even greet them
[2:58:18] when you see them you are
[2:58:21] smiling just
[2:58:23] change she has come she
[2:58:26] has I don't like that person then you
[2:58:29] are
[2:58:32] greeting God will make
[2:58:34] sure that those enemies of yours will
[2:58:36] love
[2:58:37] you and it is a very bad thing for your
[2:58:39] enemies to love
[2:58:42] you because God will LIF them
[2:58:47] in
[2:58:49] now the Bible here
[2:58:51] says when this man was
[2:58:53] praying then he that was my
[2:58:57] enemy shall see it and shame shall cover
[2:59:02] her said unto me where is the Lord thy
[2:59:07] God my eyes Shall Behold
[2:59:10] her now shall she be thren
[2:59:13] down of the
[2:59:16] streets oh my God
[2:59:18] may God give us more
[2:59:20] enemies so that he will lift us more and
[2:59:23] more the more enemies you have the more
[2:59:27] things God will do for you to prove your
[2:59:29] enemies
[2:59:32] wrong but love your
[2:59:34] enemies praise the name of the Lord so
[2:59:37] if you are seated in
[2:59:38] darkness I want to tell you today God
[2:59:40] still has a
[2:59:42] plan if you have sinned God still has a
[2:59:47] plan Hallelujah if your heart
[2:59:50] broken God still has a
[2:59:52] plan if you are discouraged this
[2:59:55] morning someone God still has a
[2:59:59] plan Hallelujah if you're confused about
[3:00:02] something in your
[3:00:04] life God still has a
[3:00:07] plan maybe you are
[3:00:10] stranded stranded know someone who get
[3:00:14] stranded God still
[3:00:16] has
[3:00:18] when God begins to Fashion your
[3:00:23] life there's one thing that God
[3:00:26] does he makes your
[3:00:29] life a
[3:00:33] mystery to your
[3:00:35] enemies so they your enemies who
[3:00:38] actually fear things they don't actually
[3:00:42] know to the extent they can even
[3:00:46] dream one time there was a man called
[3:00:50] Gideon and he was going to fight his
[3:00:52] enemy and when one brother went in the
[3:00:55] camp of his
[3:00:57] enemies he had over overheard one saying
[3:01:02] to how he
[3:01:05] dreamed coming down with a great mighty
[3:01:08] sword and
[3:01:11] Army and everybody was in fear you
[3:01:14] remember Jero how that woman you know
[3:01:18] told the spies everybody in Jero is
[3:01:22] shaken because they fear the god of
[3:01:25] Israel they know the god of Israel J Let
[3:01:29] Me Tell the kind of God I want whereby I
[3:01:32] will love my
[3:01:33] enemies but my enemies will be
[3:01:36] shaken because of my
[3:01:39] God I always know in my
[3:01:41] life no matter what happens no matter
[3:01:45] what happens God still has
[3:01:50] and as I'm finishing just right now the
[3:01:53] Holy Spirit dropped in something to in
[3:01:55] my heart for the Believers in the
[3:02:00] north of
[3:02:02] Ethiopia and and and B and others you
[3:02:05] know they've had War
[3:02:07] there and many people have
[3:02:10] died many people have died literally
[3:02:13] brother told me that there was um he
[3:02:18] Nally
[3:02:22] survived you know he had gone to to the
[3:02:25] office and they began
[3:02:27] shooting and you know and and the
[3:02:30] bullets just passed
[3:02:33] him and it was a very devastating
[3:02:36] thing and and his sons brother Jonathan
[3:02:39] listening in and
[3:02:41] brother they were supposed to go and
[3:02:43] join the
[3:02:44] Army and of course they would have died
[3:02:48] but God did not permit it and but many
[3:02:51] in that region have died many friends
[3:02:54] and relatives
[3:02:55] and so I have a word for them God still
[3:02:59] has a plan for
[3:03:01] that and I remember one time when I was
[3:03:04] were just still in the other small
[3:03:07] place um I just came on the pulpit just
[3:03:10] like now I was feeling like I'm feeling
[3:03:13] now I don't know how many were there at
[3:03:16] that
[3:03:16] time at that time God had laid aasa on
[3:03:19] my
[3:03:20] hand I said I don't know about what it
[3:03:23] will be but I
[3:03:25] feel God has a plan for
[3:03:28] our there is going to be a work in our
[3:03:31] there will be a church in
[3:03:32] our took a trip
[3:03:35] there in one visit
[3:03:38] during 30 people were
[3:03:41] baptized that had never happened before
[3:03:44] in and the church is still there and
[3:03:47] many are coming up in that
[3:03:49] area under the ministry of our brother
[3:03:51] Ephraim and so I I just feel to say even
[3:03:54] for the
[3:03:56] region of Northern
[3:03:58] Ethiopia I'm not a prophet don't
[3:04:01] make but it's a prophetic word praise
[3:04:04] the name of the Lord God is going to
[3:04:06] raise a great work in that
[3:04:08] Reg in that whole region
[3:04:11] of let me tell you God is going to use
[3:04:15] many people there to take this message
[3:04:18] and spread it all
[3:04:20] over and wherever this message
[3:04:23] goes Prosperity
[3:04:25] follows have you watched it in your
[3:04:28] life that's what God is going to
[3:04:31] do in the name of Jesus Christ and let
[3:04:34] us our

[3:04:38] plan no matter what has happened God
