[1:23] we are going to
[1:24] literally continue with what we've been
[1:26] talking about
[1:31] the gentle dispensation
[1:34] and we talked a lot about the church
[1:38] ages and the messengers of the gentile
[1:40] churches
[1:42] [Music]
[1:45] the day we are living in babies
[1:49] what god has done today
[1:51] you know
[1:52] how he has sent us a message
[1:56] through a man who
[1:58] would have the spirit of elijah
[2:01] [Music]
[2:04] now remember the spirit
[2:06] of elijah
[2:09] does not come on a group of people a
[2:11] group of men
[2:13] or preachers
[2:18] the spirit of elijah comes on a man
[2:21] [Music]
[2:52] and after he had passed off the scene
[2:55] then jesus vindicated him to be
[2:58] then the people accepted that he was
[3:00] elijah
[3:26] in his ministry where is that with
[3:28] brother william branham was so much used
[3:30] of god organ william branham yeah
[3:34] until today 15 years
[3:36] later
[3:40] his ministry still has an impact
[3:43] all over the world where is
[3:56] the man died more than 50 years ago
[3:58] considering
[4:15] [Music]
[4:21] [Music]
[4:41] it's not just somebody who's just coming
[4:44] up because he's doing miracles signs and
[4:46] wonders and then we just call him a
[4:47] prophet no the things he does must align
[4:50] with the promises of scripture when
[4:52] elijah would come soon
[5:08] you know who it is
[5:09] [Music]
[5:12] and here's one thing i want to say on
[5:14] camera hey that one
[5:17] this is important
[5:20] many
[5:21] mega church creatures
[5:59] [Music]
[6:18] we are not
[6:26] there's no way you can talk about
[6:29] the message and ignore the message
[6:41] [Music]
[6:45] remember that this message would not
[6:47] only restore us
[6:53] but it would not only restore us but it
[6:55] would also
[6:57] reveal and finish the mysteries
[7:09] [Music]
[7:31] [Music]
[7:33] and scientists are trying to research
[7:36] the link between man and beast
[7:39] science
[7:42] [Music]
[7:59] [Music]
[8:11] chapter 10 verse 7
[8:16] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[8:19] [Music]
[8:20] begins to sound
[8:22] the mystery of god
[8:46] remember he reveals his secrets to the
[8:48] babes such as woodland
[8:50] [Music]
[8:55] any teaching that is taught must be able
[8:58] to
[8:59] go take us back to the cross indicators
[9:01] [Music]
[9:05] i do not believe there is anything that
[9:06] is revealed to us just for knowledge
[9:10] to be creative
[9:11] [Music]
[9:12] whatever is revealed to us is for us to
[9:14] get deeper into christ
[9:19] so the purpose of this
[9:21] teaching on this episode
[9:23] is to
[9:24] help you
[9:25] get deeper into christ
[9:33] the bible says
[9:53] [Music]
[9:56] why did jesus have to die on the cross
[9:59] right here
[10:00] you know
[10:02] do you know that when the purpose of the
[10:05] cross is revealed to you you will love
[10:07] jesus christ even more
[10:11] [Music]
[10:15] and so i might not go into the real
[10:18] depth of this teaching but the little
[10:20] things that i'm going to speak that are
[10:22] on my heart
[10:24] are meant to make you love jesus christ
[10:30] [Music]
[10:36] and so
[10:37] do you realize as i said earlier that on
[10:40] this earth today we have two different
[10:43] kind of seeds
[10:54] [Music]
[11:11] that cannot get lost no matter
[11:22] [Music]
[11:37] [Music]
[11:57] uh we're going to read quite several
[12:00] scriptures on this topic
[12:04] and i think i'll begin with genesis 3
[12:06] 15.
[12:15] between thee and the woman and between
[12:17] thy seed
[12:19] the serpent you the serpent i will put
[12:21] an enmity between thee and the woman and
[12:24] between thy seed the serpent seed and
[12:26] her seed it shall bring thy head and
[12:28] that shall breathe
[12:48] so when the scripture here speaks of the
[12:50] seed of the
[12:53] [Music]
[13:11] of course many of you by now know
[13:15] that jesus christ came through the
[13:17] bloodline it is
[13:29] [Music]
[13:46] that's the
[13:48] [Music]
[14:15] in the beginning
[14:18] and i want you to look at a few things
[14:20] here
[14:22] before anything happens
[14:26] in genesis chapter 2 already
[14:33] [Music]
[14:43] made the lord god to grow every tree
[14:45] that is pleasing to the sight and good
[14:47] for food the tree of life also in the
[14:49] midst of their garden and the tree of
[14:51] knowledge of good and evil
[15:02] [Music]
[15:09] [Music]
[15:10] foreign
[15:12] [Music]
[15:19] [Music]
[15:31] [Music]
[15:39] now last night is what i want to
[15:40] emphasize on and out of the ground made
[15:43] the lord go to grow every tree
[15:49] [Music]
[15:51] now that is every tree that is good and
[15:53] please and to the side
[15:58] of course this even continues to say
[16:01] that the trees that are good for food
[16:06] gamba
[16:09] so those kind of trees we are talking
[16:10] about are the trees that you know
[16:14] the physical trees that all of us know
[16:16] every tiffany but then there are also
[16:20] other types of trees
[16:22] [Music]
[16:29] [Music]
[16:53] [Music]
[17:12] [Music]
[17:30] was he there yeah when this is the
[17:32] things were happening
[17:36] so then how were they written
[17:39] he had to see a vision about this
[17:43] he had to have a prophetic uh prophetic
[17:46] insight
[17:50] about these things
[17:52] to be able to write them down
[17:54] in the same way
[17:56] god would reveal it the same way
[17:58] nicotine
[18:16] like he has in our time to reveal to us
[18:20] these secrets that are embedded here in
[18:22] the description
[18:25] below
[18:32] [Music]
[18:38] [Music]
[18:50] blessed is the man that worketh not in
[18:52] the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
[18:55] in the way of the sinners nor cities in
[18:57] the seat of this country but his delight
[18:59] is in the law of the lord and in his law
[19:02] does he meditate day and night
[19:05] and it shall be like a tree blocked by
[19:07] the rivers of water that he bringeth
[19:09] forth his fruit in his season
[19:11] his life also shall not wither and
[19:13] whatsoever he do it shall prosper
[19:21] at the time
[19:35] [Music]
[19:57] [Music]
[20:00] so in other words the bible says tree
[20:03] means a man or
[20:07] [Music]
[20:14] [Music]
[20:35] jesus saith unto him i am the way
[20:38] the truth
[20:39] and
[20:40] the life yes
[20:42] [Music]
[20:46] jesus
[21:05] [Music]
[21:11] so jesus
[21:13] yes is the dream of life
[21:16] we have found it
[21:18] is the tree of life
[21:19] bible in the book of revelation says he
[21:21] that shall overcome
[21:23] he will give of him to eat of the tree
[21:25] of life
[21:34] [Music]
[21:48] [Music]
[21:56] the bible states i believe
[21:59] son of man
[22:01] take up our lamentation upon the king of
[22:03] terrorists and say unto him thus saith
[22:05] the lord god
[22:06] thou sensed up the sun full of wisdom
[22:09] and beauty and perfect in beauty thou
[22:12] hast been in head in the garden of god
[22:14] every precious stone was thy covering
[22:16] the sabias the toppers and the diamond
[22:19] the burial the oams the jasper the
[22:21] suffer the emerald days cabal and gold
[22:24] the workmanship of thy tablets and thy
[22:26] pipes were was prepared in the
[22:29] in the day that thou was created thou
[22:31] art the anointed cherry that covered i
[22:34] have said this soul
[22:36] thou was upon the only mountain of god
[22:39] thou hast walked up and down the in the
[22:41] midst of the stones of fire that was
[22:43] perfect in thy ways from the day that
[22:46] that was created till iniquity was found
[22:49] in the ezekiel
[22:58] [Music]
[23:13] [Music]
[23:43] [Music]
[23:53] [Music]
[24:06] [Music]
[24:16] so this is
[24:17] the so this is a created creature
[24:22] was on the mount of god charity
[24:25] in the end of the game
[24:29] was perfect
[24:58] he was cast down he he was cast down
[25:01] yeah
[25:03] he fought with the michael yeah
[25:06] and and he was defeated now when he was
[25:08] cast down now
[25:11] and
[25:12] we say that
[25:24] [Music]
[25:43] [Music]
[25:51] [Music]
[25:55] then when the evil spirit oh your movie
[25:57] that old circle
[25:59] whatever you want to call it
[26:01] now
[26:02] so when you see the tree of life
[26:06] [Music]
[26:08] the bible says
[26:16] [Music]
[26:32] now before we get into the details of
[26:34] what was actually done
[26:44] because we've had bible teachers by
[26:46] potatoes telling us that adam and eve
[26:49] ate an apple come on
[27:00] [Music]
[27:18] unto the woman you shall not surely die
[27:21] for god for god does know that in the
[27:23] day that you eat thereof then your eyes
[27:26] shall be opened and he shall be as gods
[27:28] knowing good and evil almost
[27:47] that the tree
[27:48] was good for food and that it was
[27:51] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[27:53] desired to make one wise she took of the
[27:55] fruit thereof and didn't eat
[27:58] and gave also unto her husband with her
[28:20] so now we realize here that the bible
[28:23] says
[28:24] before
[28:25] if you add this
[28:28] f from this tree
[28:30] she
[28:31] ate fast without her husband
[28:40] [Music]
[28:42] then that's when she came to her husband
[28:44] i will not generated anybody and
[28:47] together the bible says they did it
[28:52] so now what is it that they eat
[29:10] have it written down here it says then
[29:12] jesus said unto them verily verily i say
[29:15] unto you except you eat the flesh of the
[29:18] son of man and drink his blood you have
[29:21] no life in you
[29:22] who saw eateth my flesh and drink it my
[29:25] plan and as eternal life and i will
[29:28] raise him up at the last day for my
[29:30] flesh is meet indeed and my blood is
[29:32] drinking deep he that eateth my flesh
[29:34] and bringeth my blood dwelleth in me and
[29:37] i in him
[29:41] [Music]
[30:10] [Music]
[30:21] that everybody that believes in him must
[30:23] eat him
[30:25] yes
[30:31] so the people were offended of course
[30:33] and they left him in the japanese
[30:37] they never understood that the eating
[30:39] was not the physical eating as a
[30:43] vampires
[30:46] [Music]
[31:06] and that we know that there is going to
[31:09] be a brown and there's going to be a
[31:11] wedding supper served in the sky that's
[31:14] just as sure to be as god is because
[31:18] it's his word
[31:21] come out over my people said the lord
[31:23] yeah come on
[31:25] continue
[31:26] call your creeds and your self-style
[31:29] things i will receive yourself lord
