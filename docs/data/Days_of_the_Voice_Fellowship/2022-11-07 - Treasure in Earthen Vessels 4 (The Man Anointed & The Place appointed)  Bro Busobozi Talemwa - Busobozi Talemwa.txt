========================================

foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] camping we're discussing with the brothers students so so if you cannot raise in the morning but I think it's something we should have a discussion on the service is very early in the morning and you know we our concentration is still up before the sun comes [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he is [Music] keeping me Jesus keeping me he is keeping me he is the Holy Ghost on Fire [Music] Jesus is keeping me alive or praise this morning hallelujah thank you Jesus you are keeping us alive this morning oh thank you Jesus Lord we are happy this morning [Music] chapter 7. [Music] Judges chapter seven is just right after Joshua but okay what is how we are going to read a people read only one verse and then we you know to the currency versus uh 21. and they stood every man in his place round about the camp and all the host rain and cried and fled foreign foreign [Music] uh keep his treasures in a vessel of of of of metal or in a vessel of something like like aluminum or something like that yeah because his confidence is not in the first so where he is keeping the treasure because his confidence is in the Treasure itself so The Treasure of God is not the flesh your flesh The Treasure of God is what he has deposited and what he has deposited in you is the word of God of God is a light that is shining in your life and the more it shines it goes on growing bigger and bigger and bigger the more you hear the word the more light just strikes you don't come away it becomes bigger and bigger and you know that when the light strikes there is one thing that happened without Darkness please Darkness and Light cannot be in the same place at the same time when when life comes Darkness please rather God said in the beginning and I want to say that when we hear the word of God in our life you believe that church praise the name of the Lord amen so you have to get out what is out of me this morning by saying amen about me now you helped me preach this morning so we can see what the Holy Spirit has for us now whenever God sends a light Captain there is a man anointed to received there is a place what I'm saying is you have your place in the body of Christ and that blessed Rich French cannot be replaced by another woman alive that cheat them you know people sometimes around why do we have a lot of fights and a lot of battles because people are afraid of others taking their pictures you know you find that if a Man Loves a Woman especially in Africa here where we have polygamy you find that uh you know a man has more than one woman and you know polygamy is almost legally accepted in our country so you will find that all these women will be fighting for their place and in the same way even when a man is married [Music] [Music] that he can represent foreign and there is a place anointed our place appointed I told which friendship for God to bless you he wants to bless you there so that he can anoint you come after and use you in my dreams praise the name of the Lord I want to look at verse Psalms 105 13. when they went from one nation to another from one Kingdom to another he suffered no man to do them wrong yeah he reproved the Kings for their sex saying that's not my anointed and do my prophets know how to foreign 105 13. 105 13 yes [Music] praise the name of the Lord saying that's not my anointed foreign okay I'm so glad that I can say um God always wants to correct his own cartoon just like children parents who are here how many of you would like somebody to spank your child many of you would not want that even when your child has done something wrong you don't want anybody we want to be the one to spank your child because you can't hurt him somebody else is Anointed God never wants his prophets you'll be touched by anyone amen you notice in the Bible there was a Man Called Moses and Moses had given one of the laws no Israelite was supposed to marry out of Israelites Moses went and married an Ethiopians and he was supposed to be the prophet of God and when his sister and the other prophets and other brothers he said who are you to do that how come you do that and and you know the sister of Moses became sick and and and you know they could not get any remedies unless the man of God prayed and we've seen that over and over you know even at one place one of the men of God lied and you know this man took the woman in his in the Integrity of his heart without knowing what happened when God came down he was going to kill the kids he said how can you take the wife of my Prophet how dare you do that and he said now restore the man his wife and we find it over and over in scripture Elisha was walking on the road you know these little children who were not told well by their parents and they came scorning and laughing maybe they were laughing at his boat children can be on the villages you know he was seated you know you know he was signing all these papers which were declaring him as a king and giving middle authorities but maybe he was frustrated you know he was just on the table Yeah he was you know cigaretting some of his people to come on so these people went on the news they put it all over you know you know I think is this I think I mean this is a human being because he is not a normal human beings if you speak glasses on yourself finished foreign sometimes you can even reach a moment yeah when you are not going to pray but you just think and things will happen amenities we need to recognize our places [Music] the day you come to that realization that God is not going to give you breakthroughs because of your ability then my brother you will achievement and and really this subject that I'm speaking on is something about our day today living I'm talking again lives because of what we think of ourselves you know you always think law of yourself because people can't even stop God because I think law of themselves of Herod so that the horse of the midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of Murray in the valley and the Lord said unto Gideon the people that are with thee are too far many for me to give the midianites into their hands lest Israel want themselves against me saying mine owner understand and accept me Nicola [Music] maybe it wasn't the place appointed Charlie she said and they were not yet anointed so here Israel was suffering at the hand of the media night for years when he is let me tell you sometimes God but sometimes it doesn't get to do it because of the place where we are already poetry because if he does it at that place you will think it was your own strength you will think it was your own energy it was your ability and now God blesses you in a place for weakness it is at the place of weakness that God wants to anoint that much raise the name of the Lord and so we see here that these people 32 number one around to one the middle were always fighting against the Lord came to him he told him look I want you to go take a look and I've given the Middle East there are very many actually there were 22 000 people he said God these people are so many countries for me to give the immediates into their house the moment you think we can store the walls that you were so holy God will make sure you don't defeat your enemies the moment you think we can store the words you are so rich God Will Make sure you do not attain your goals the moment you think we cast all the words you have accumulated a lot of wisdom and knowledge and if you read this Bible very well it has happened over and over again God always confounds the wisdom of the wise am I preaching to someone God always confounds the wisdom of the world thank you for the amen those people sought for two minutes God is not in big crowds have you ever thought about it God is never in a big crowded and then someone will say hey Jesus had five thousand years wait a moment those five thousand were there for as long as they prayed and the fish was dead but even when the fish and the bread was there now you were at the middle name they could not stand the word when Jesus began to open the scroll yes we are single room is single they said these things are so hard for us how can he tell us to eat him and drink his blood we have to leave again and the Bible says the end shall not come until there is a falling away fast so don't fear if you hear some who said they have left a message that has to happen foreign [Applause] hallelujah amen those who hate me they go again and those who love me and they don't love me because they love me but I love me because they love the world those are the ones amen and every Pastor that preaches the word that conviction you know you don't want people to love you because you're a superstar foreign Jesus yes remained only with a few yes one of them was still uh the Devil Himself Jesus Christ let me tell you we don't cut down our army by chasing our people um by giving people wrong and bad attitude foreign in the ears of the people saying whatsoever is fearful and Afraid let him return and depart Ali from the ma from Mount Gilead and they returned of the people 20 and 2000 and there remain ten thousand foreign [Music] that's why you sit in churches every Church but people will keep coming whatever and people will keep going again and then you ask yourself who chased them and who kept those ones who stayed out at any time I think we have something wrong people who love to do that you know make you know puts them in that kind of uh spiral oh I think there's something wrong you know maybe our music has a problem let me tell you these things could all be true but the true seed of God now he is that is being preached and here 22 000 people left in between and over the years that I've been preaching this message on average 15 years but I've noticed that and you know God has also allowed me to be in the beginning assemblies I've never in all my life uh uh been or attended uh a mega church I've preached to some of them but on occasions all my life I've dealt with small groups but you know you watch a church grow from 50 people by the time you get 10 people but why is it coming you have in and out you have had about 50 people um and all those take a piece of your life as a minister you pray with each of them preach to them you pray with them and only for them to leave again foreign foreign hallelujah amen there is always a chance until the chance is not there what happened let me tell you that the very last person that was saved when Jesus was on earth when Jesus died on the cross yesterday he died on the very last minute it was seven last minute imagine there were many people who were in Paradise for years and years and years and they were all waiting for the Messiah to come and redeem because there was a prophecya and he will take them all out of the grace just like we have a promise also our Christ Jesus is going to come the crystal again and it will take us out of the grace my brother died with Jesus foreign what if he was sad I don't even want to preach anymore how can the father let me suffer like this how can I go through this time for them I am sad now I am hungry that Soul would have been lost even at that better moment remember to say it ain't true these were two Pips that one of them [Music] Serve Yourself not foreign you never say that there you'll get it but Jesus he was full of grace and full of Truth oh Hallelujah some Believers are so full of truth that they have no Grace at all right hey Jesus was full of grace and truth he saw this man he did not comment but because Jesus was full of grace this man was touched thank you [Music] what about the man who has died for no reason foreign [Applause] that light in your soul hallelujah hallelujah and that moment you will be in Paradise hallelujah amen in less than 24 hours don't you love the message hallelujah amen and Jesus yes you kept his appointment yes amen don't you think you're a holy brother want to even think you're better than others I think some people have had a wrong approach to this message foreign hahaha Gideon okay you had so much [Applause] amen where is Isaac to recruitment hallelujah amen you know Isaac is in recruitment you know he went out yeah hallelujah amen and you know what my name he was so much you will think it was by yourself amen sometimes you say God when he serves us because sometimes and then at the end of the days [Music] I want to use you Hallelujah without your weakness yes yes with all your insufficience that's why you have all those weaknesses and then at the end of the day and then the Army becomes very small the Lesser you become the more happy God is the money praise the Lord come and give us the way so we go to verse 4. tell all the fearful to go away you tell others who are afraid to go away and how many people left why do people sometimes leave the message how can I leave a Christian Life as a younger man how can I live without fornication that is how can I live without cheating when I am City dip How can I cannot live like that um they are afraid but yeah because they think they can't do it the plastic is so great that's when God says let them go away so I ask you are you afraid easy okay [Music] [Music] is not in yourself it is in the light it is you know I always sing that song Victory belongs to Jesus [Music] foreign she said without you mortally God can accomplish Allah praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen without you without you um we have a a proverb in Uganda which says those that are together they can bite the meat foreign [Music] God looks at the weakness and the ability to accept that weakness if you can accept your weakness you can accept history and so they remained only 20 only 10 000. as if that is not enough foreign the people are yet too many bring them down onto the water and I will try them for thee there and it shall be that of whom I say unto thee this shall go with thee the same shall go with this unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not okay so he brought down the people onto the water and the Lord everyone set by himself likewise everyone that powers down upon his knees to drink to their mouth where 300 men [Music] but all the rest of the people bow down upon their knees to drink water [Music] and the Lord said unto Gideon by 300 men that loved I will save you now in hand and let all the people the other people go every other man every man unto his place the second phase God told them take these men down to the brook I'm going to tell you what to do praise the Lord now I want you to see what they call elections being elected it's interesting Gideon there was no Gideon's mentality of the challenge there was no gideonic strength it is prepared by a god even before the foundations of the world because he told him take these people and to the Brooks I will tell you what is next then they went to the Brooks the charge is still Big Ten though even the Cockroaches ran away it is beautiful tell your neighbor it is good it is true foreign weak things Hallelujah man see my business yo it is not the power of your business that the frame of your business is it good will be a good will you go to the business in your business because somebody was working from them I'm going to sell it to you Goodwill in five minutes foreign [Applause] does anybody understand it as long as we are preaching the true message is able to take weak men and women make powerful men and women hallelujah amen both spiritually and physical I don't believe in my God make me spiritually powerful and physically and financially securities foreign foreign that's why we believe in Divine Healing Miracle science foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] and if you can accept that you will serve yourself a lot of problems humble yourself and accept okay to use you for something and ten thousand people which apparently was a very huge Church [Music] fell down 300 people again the 970 are good but the kids are you an evangelist you know you've got to preach in the church or maybe the past accept it and it presents it to the people foreign [Music] am I for God to serve the world currency he had to become weakness and that made him like one of them foreign but he was weak I'm ready hope that you're taking something to your house and only 300 remain and these people election how were they chosen it wasn't the pastor saying you leave my church you live now from I don't believe in excommunicating Justice I believe
