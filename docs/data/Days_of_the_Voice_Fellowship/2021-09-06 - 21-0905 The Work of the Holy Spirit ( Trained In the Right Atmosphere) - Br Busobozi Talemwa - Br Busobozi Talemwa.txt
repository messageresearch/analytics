all right sister you can have your seats we are going to be speaking on the work of the holy spirit this subject is not a small subject and so i i'm going to be speaking on this in several services to come on but today we are going to be speaking on trained in the right atmosphere [Music] atmosphere [Music] in the sorority we had a meeting with us about where there was a five ministers yeah something like that you know the brothers were able to come and we inaugurated the translation of this message into the artisan language wonderful the message is [Music] is uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] where we were born because we have had this letter being read to us because we have had a different sound quality [Music] [Music] [Music] you know here foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come you can [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] okay [Music] oh shall he speak [Music] hallelujah yo [Music] [Applause] a group of [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign loser [Music] holy spirit foreign [Music] manifestation [Music] because amen hallelujah i mean if you receive the holy spirit you must receive if you receive you believe the one you must receive that we might be justified by faith but after that faith is come we are no longer under a school master verse 26 for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus can you read that brother where for the lord was our school master to bring us unto christ can you just interpret directly [Music] amen that we might be justified by faith but after that faith has come we are no longer under a school master [Music] you know who a school master is a teacher someone who trains you up someone who tells you what to do someone who tells you what not to do [Music] someone who guides you someone who prepares you someone who rebukes you [Music] are you following me all this is the work of a teacher but now we realize when all this is the work of the holy spirit [Music] the holy spirit is supposed to teach you the holy spirit is supposed to guide you the holy spirit is to show you things to come to protect you you should do all that work but before you receive the holy ghost that is the work of the school master and who is the holy spirit your holy spirit is jesus christ himself [Music] before he came there was the law why do you want me to take her and today in your individual life as a christian but everyone come to christ before you receive the holy ghost you must come here and sit under the word and be trained in the kingdom and be told what you ought before you receive him i don't know i must train you you're not quitting because the work of the holy spirit is for you to be trained is for you to be told what to do now after you receive the holy spirit and you hear me tell you what to do that's obvious people who usually have a problem with preachers or what the bible says is are those people who do not have the holy spirit [Music] but if you have the holy spirit and they bring a hammer at the helm of the world as long as this is the world you will accept it that's why if someone is doing something wrong java whatever [Music] hallelujah do not have choices before the age of accountability parents are fully responsible for god [Music] mothers and fathers i'm talking to you now you are fully responsible before god overnight you'll just have to sit them down and and teach them oh world inaudible [Music] i realized my daughter listened to the service very well [Music] we have the power to decide what we want [Music] [Applause] [Music] the bible says if if you accept him without the knowledge of your father and if your father gets to know about it but he has a god-given [Applause] [Music] and some people say well you know let them be the way they want to be you know you for us we just give birth to the flesh then yeah [Applause] amen i mean that man must have his house his family under subjection [Music] [Music] [Applause] the way a man has control over the house mama said there were a number to train up their children in the ways of god so that's the ministers of the world [Music] when someone is doing something wrong they just let it pass [Music] the holy spirit if someone is doing something wrong [Music] oh if you are given an opportunity by god to speak to his people and you're like let me talk things which will make them happy so they can love me i can be able to teach again [Music] will tell you that they are telling you to do things because they are led by the spirit of faith and they don't find what they are telling you to do in the bible run away from such preachers those are the ones you know you know you know bringing divorces those are the ones telling you to you know bring a gallons of oil they just power power power on you when you're not repenting [Music] that is [Music] [Music] you don't come here for me to entertain you can we tell a number you say i am not a comedian i am a servant of god i am a preacher and what i preach i must preach it from the bible just like a mother like a father should not fear the children you train them but then they can you rebuke them you position them but they come with you yes i know hallelujah amen the choices before the holy spirit are all that the children make are always cannot [Music] a woman a woman who looks like this american height and uh also maybe if she's from a rich family and she's educated you see his mind is that gathered by the holy spirit oh yeah it's a call of mine before they receive the holy spirit according to the last of the eyes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] guidance [Music] [Applause] because the [Music] where is that what do you call yourself where you touching if you don't believe i am healed you will die in your sins this man no man has ever spoken like this man who was jesus christ yes he was god himself yes yes but the bible says he humbled himself hallelujah [Music] do you know what it means for the god who created the heavens and the earth on the cross almost naked he would play in the shame [Applause] the lights the moon shut down and you always watch the sun shut down shut down we cannot see our creator in shape maybe some of them [Music] if you have him in your life a parent is a school master before faith has come oh [Music] so you mummies cut him with a mama well i should have said mamas [Music] that is and i know this generation which we are living in do you know that the holy spirit has his own laws if you can't even obey the laws of your mother and your father do you think you can obey the laws of you of the holy spirit the work of the father and the mom [Music] israel to train you what when you are training someone come on you are preparing them for something to come [Music] [Music] you know what i think everybody has his own opinion but one of the greatest and to my opinion the greatest president that we ever had in this nation in the usa he says was abraham lincoln oh my god [Music] not because he was a republican but he says let me go down here because he was a godly man he was raised to serve god yes did you hear that this man abraham lincoln was raised somebody had raised the hebrews if there is anything that i want to praise uh to give praise to he said my life was influenced by a godly mother who told me to pray and to know jesus as my savior agamanti what anger why do we do you realize many of you here mochimani kumawano many of the things that you do right you attribute them to your mothers [Music] i still remember when my wife many times tells me that she's going to fast and pray i know if she's going to pray for her children she reminds me that my mother told them [Music] [Music] no wonder she's doing the same thing with her children but one [Music] somehow i do not know why she liked me among all the others but she would always tell me come we go to the convention [Music] and i was very young seven years yeah [Music] and i think i saw a man you know in the neighborhood from the convention center and this man had put i think they either had cut a uh a goat or a ship i'm saying so they had that plate of the head of that animal on the on the plates and i remember what my mom told me it has been in my life all these years listen to me you mothers why don't you teach your children you will speak with them all their life [Music] of never will because of that what you have given them the other one will be with them forever now that you will shape their lives they will represent christ but electricity [Music] [Applause] she was a true mother all of them were influenced by their mothers and the prophet of god tells us how moses's mother was there always with a boy telling him remember these don't give that opportunity to someone else if you can't teach your children but whatever somebody said someone else will teach them and that someone will always be the devil already take your place say that support your father take your place hear [Music] it's an opportunity to bring forth a [Music] you don't have to just marry a woman a beautiful woman [Music] [Music] [Music] oh by how her father has [Music] are you listening to me now my name is and and but the banham says that uh that president abraham wrinkling in america was the greatest president that he has ever known why because that her mother his mother told him to pray and also to know jesus [Music] christ your family is what you are your family is what you are your family yes if you are drunk and your family will be drunk sometimes people think that you know this thing has been going through the blood [Music] formula [Music] i refuse to sing everything began to break this line oh i know if they were back in my father's father's father by the authority of this message [Music] is that [Music] [Music] it is in you [Music] you pass it on down to another generation [Music] [Applause] oh the reason why you last watch because your father lasted the reason why you commit fornication [Music] because your dad used to do it you have a child with this one you have a child with another one he knows that because your father did it the reason why you tell lies because your father did it gohan's check okay the very messiah those things you grew seeing them and you thought that that is a part of you it is not in the blood not even witchcraft it is what you grew up seeing [Music] and it has influenced you you grew in that atmosphere why do you think oh people help me preach this you know why do you think that but when you are when someone is born from a poor family they will most likely be poor if someone is born from a family oh my gosh where their father has never driven and their father's father is never driven and [Music] no [Music] you begin to think that is you your [Music] now come on why is it right that they you know when they grow up seeing mommy's suffering that is suffering they think i

know back whether you you don't have to do things like that the way that the color being you will have jesus said all things are possible to them that we believe yes you have not because you asked me

commander family and jesus hallelujah amen most of us in this church don't have homes for our families we should ask in abundance some of you don't even think about it [Music] leave them what are you talking [Music] i challenge you each of you to believe it is whatsoever that you need to naturally don't ask small if you want capital but i can understand ask god for one million [Music] because next

now hallelujah amen yes sir don't let your mind be cast down though the bible says cast note your what bibliogram no no there's a way he puts it here confidence i think hey [Music] brother give me that scripture hallelujah cast note your confidence yes that's what i want to read did you get it brother hallelujah's confidence in you in uganda confidence which has great recompense of reward hallelujah if you have amen he can make you to run when you think not even worse he can give you what man thought impossible he can provide [Music] but you find mothers this child i wish you to get a better word for that this this is be the child your confidence should be in christ train that child come on i'm attending hallelujah amen and by the way by the end of the day of this series you will see where i am going in our tournament [Music] [Laughter] said something very important i want to quote organ he said no man can go higher and go higher than their pastor [Music] i'm assuming i kind of feel i'm about to finish by the way i'll just finish complete this subject later but i want i just feel to address this a little bit because brother can you find me the quote right quick in the message in the message pegaman church age you can either preach your brother you can get it it says the hidden manner emmanuel and a little something special what is special i can't trust you the blessings of the holy ghost the blessings of the holy ghost no that is for the whole congregation but the hidden manner name was a little more knowledge of the scripture that [Music] could teach others i suppose he's supposed to be are you know that way then he says this you will never leave no higher than your pastor joshua foreign to interpret this literally but i want you to see it in another way the pasta is the one with the hidden manner in a congregation why right because it's meant to be a teacher it's meant to be a guide no sheep can claim to be higher than the shepherds now what does the prophet mean here now together even in the message name of aka god blesses your pastor of that special revelation to be able to bless you you can't is not having it you won't have it either now it doesn't actually fall that's what it means church together that's why the shepherd will lead them to where are you they're blind leading they're blind they are in the denomination yes in our church there is women and preachers our pastors but it's okay for me i don't believe it but i don't believe it it's not right it is up to the church [Music] you cannot be higher than that if your leaders are going to hell you are going to help too on [Music] [Laughter] if you call me on the rapture morning and i'm still here just know we are all doomed [Laughter] you're [Music] [Applause] of the power of god will follow [Music] is universe prophecies must be there but also god must manifest himself in our lives and change us take us from glory to glory then i can know my eyes i've seen that come in the glory of the lord even when i'm here never a man do you know you can you must be in a position whereby you can say last year i was like this but this year i'm not like this if i'm pastoring someone you know for the first year second year third year fourth year every year foreign it over too then it must bring forth a change there must be a change in your life for five years ten years you've been the same find another church brother [Music] praise the name of aloha come here and just to give a testimony come up with jesus over brother brother and i did not i'd not ask you brother come right here and tell us the testament of how you receive the holy spirit i'm about to finish and i said by the marvin he came brother joel you know uh brought him around and uh he's been around he was always a very quiet brother like that no smile nothing but you know something happened all of a sudden and it's just one example yesterday [Music] every sunday yeah i was baptized the first time uh but uh they did not lay hands on me and uh one day i was reading the bible [Music] peter those first apostles when they were after baptizing people they laid their hands on them [Music] maybe i thought they are the reason why they did it for me i i couldn't understand but i had to believe uh now i think uh a few a few weeks ago weak international same other god yeah i was baptized the second time nevertheless after being baptized we we pray together they lay hands on me after the prayer marisa after i stood up i felt something [Music] young men who have been a part of our bible study but the matter was giving me the testimony the other day he's been coming here every friday you know what time do they start in the morning every friday morning and and they they finish in the afternoon they are always here in prayer the world is having an impact on them always here in prayer in prayer in prayer and he was telling me that it's not like a prayer they use your prayers there's been a part of them he usually comes and ministers to them sometimes i was i was given a testament i've not been a part of it yet but i've been given a testimony now from jerusalem you know that god moves in in that prayer you know you you must get to that level well you're not talking about that where about you you should say yes i've been trained to [Music] [Music] we must train the children truly not in the cabin if we don't train them yes down the road will not have believers [Music] you must be able to give a testimony you must be able to give a testimony if you have no testimony with you ever since you believed the message then you are going backwards and that testimony must reflect in your spiritual and physical life you don't want to be among those who are giving a testimony that is bad i used to be this but nowadays are you still like that your child will hurt you so you are also joking we want to see that god that you had then let him be manifested now [Music] some of you who used to come in the church [Music] [Music] use phones if you in the message and you use a phone in the chat you have a very big problem [Music] i know that some of those sisters they started changing slowly [Music] [Music] every one of us hallelujah i've barely gone only halfway the first page and i had about five pages see how the holy spirit will lead us but mothers i hope you have got your dose for today [Music] children all of you together that the holy spirit may do his work in us [Music] changing me and changing [Music] the word of god [Music] changing me so [Music] amen as i invite brother martin to come [Music] anyone who has had the word and maybe you feel condemned god [Music] [Music] you don't want to be like that very difficult donkey to train undergoing people you want to accept training [Music] holy spirit can be able to take you into higher heights you can be able to design your life even as he's been designing your life now by the way so he can mold you know [Music] [Music] to lift up this before you that have come desiring that they might be changed desiring that they may be what they have had today rush them the desire of their [Music] may they not just
