amen I greet you all in the precious name of Jesus Christ I'm rejoicing tonight because I have great friends with with us here tonight hey man uh a few weeks ago I think about two weeks ago we had a wonderful time in Nairobi with the Saints there is and it looks like they loved us because they are very busy following us up so uh brother Paul and brother brother Amos have been on a mission trip to uh Rwanda I said because of you but we call it so and I think brother Paul was also in some parts of Congo and on some of his other I usually call them diplomatic missions but I thank God that they have come our way as they are on their way back home amen I mean so uh it was very difficult for me because I love both brothers and I know but that you know I've been over the pool for a very long time but in all kind of poles I know there is if I begin to give the whole history we will not have a service seeing because I remember as far it goes as far as when we were you know on motorbikes and we were riding motorbikes as we are singing going for mission trips in the streets of uh Ethiopia especially to do evangelism and now it's been years it's been you know the Lord Has Done many wonderful things over the years and the most great the greatest thing that he has done by the poor area both of us are still standing in the messages amen The Anchor Holds and so uh I've had a long history about the Paul but I've known him for years but recently Nairobi we mean it's at a bit close they close for the first time travel is brother Paul was there uh to some of you who might have watched that um how do you call it TV yeah the panel discussion available several ministers are lined up and they are discussing on the message with it that's not on TV universe and so brother Paul was uh the the main panelist I don't know if that's the word and he I remember he told Brother Amos asked him a question was the one who started the discussion um and I was thinking oh brother almost has the lion anointing because you know when you start a discussion when you've not when the heat has not yet come up and you you are the one who is opening the door for everybody um I thought that was nice brother Amos and he had quite a wonderful insights of the world itself [Music] this is [Music] Uganda I'm jumbo I'm Jambo I have been given a very easy task to come and greet you good job so I'm doing what the pastor said I should do it but you're not responding well so I'll stand here until you respond [Music] I think my work is done now okay yeah but I would say I'm very very happy to be here this evening foreign [Music] it's really a wonderful moment for me to be standing on this wonderful you know red carpet here capite because the last time I was with you there was no carpet but now there is a carpet there was a tent outside now the building has covered so really I can say I'm really blessed [Music] he gave us quite some good stuff in Kenya yeah so when when they left we said we just want to go and Touch the Hem once again so we are here to receive an impartation and we are really getting it we are so happy even for this wonderful time and uh yes the Lord was gracious we had a service on Friday night service both of us who are taking the service at the end of it all nine people believed in that service and then on Sunday another five or four were added because [Music] we've been through much together the laws and the highs of life he has really shaped my Ministries that's why today we can still meet after over 10 years you know supposed to be the best man in his wedding and that was just one year I think after we met each other and I pushed him to the fire why have you not why have you not uh I asked him why have you noted then he told me I'm going to tell you then after a Shotwell he told me now it's all going to happen but he deliberately chose a day when my firstborn was coming but 22nd of March was my first born [Music] so I don't know if he did deliberately now as the brother said I'm not going to take the service that is one of the reasons I'm very happy amen because I can sit and listen so my work is just to welcome the minister whom the Lord has prepared brother yeah he believed way before me [Music] I got confidence that a young man can stand in their message foreign [Music] [Music] I have a good surprise I see brother Peter here that's quite some good surprise and all of you are a good surprise to me may the Lord bless you can leave my brother Lee oh look to Jesus recorded in Hallelujah it is [Music] Hallelujah [Music] it is [Music] Hallelujah [Music] friendly when I looked to Jesus [Music] recorded [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] if there is any other introduction we can do when we are seated The Book of Numbers 14. we shall read from verse 21 to 25. and then you shall go to the Book of Joshua chapter 15. to [Music] [Music] and we thank you Father because it is this carcass that has United us foreign the pastor here Brothers we wouldn't have known each other I did nothing for the message but we thank you Father because you know where your electric we are so glad father to see that we have a part of your body here that we can Fellowship we bless your Holy Name bless this church every family in this church we thank you Father for the word even that we are going to read and the Holy Spirit ministering on it we are depending on your father even those who are streaming the service of God foreign [Music] [Music] it starts from number 13. but we are going to take a portion because of time but as truly as I live all the Earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord because all those men which have been my glory and my miracles uh sorry because all those men which have sin my glory and my Miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these men these 10 times have not hearkened to my voice surely they shall not see the land which I swear unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoked me seed but my servant call him because he had another spirit with him and had followed me fully him will I bring into the land where into he went and his seed shall possess it now the amalekites and the canonites dwelt in the Valley tomorrow turn you and get you into the Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea okay boys [Music] [Music] community [Music] verse 13 to 15. and Joshua blessed him and gave and to call up the son of Jeff name Hebron for an inheritance and Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb's son of jephune the Kelly side and to this day because that he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel and the name of Hebron before was kijaba which Abba was a great man among the anakims the land had rest from war Yeshua is yes Hallelujah once again I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's my first time to preach ERS but I believe God according to his plan before the foundation of the world he preplanned about this day foreign [Music] some people say that that name is [Music] greetings from Nairobi because we were not sure if we were going to preach we have to use the shortest time possible I want to use a Titan call it Guided by the supersense [Music] to possess our god-given inheritance my inspiration is coming from the message that was preached by the prophet in 1959. it should be evening yeah he says God gave those senses but they are given you as a gift and it depends on how you what you yield you yield this sense is true [Music] will be the way that your wife your life is controlled [Applause] [Music] was these five senses given foreign they were not given to guide you they were away but there was given you the sixth sense and that sixth sense it belongs to only the Christian you and you cannot have this Sixth Sense until you become a Christian is the only way that you can ever have any more than five natural senses this is where I got my title but the Sixth Sense is better known to the Christian as faith is the one that governs and guides you and it is superior to all the other senses it's Superior to all the senses [Music] the other five senses super sense is the holy spirit Faith Of God that dwells in you Hallelujah you will wonder why we read from the scripture from the book of uh numbers and in the Book of Joshua to her and you you wonder what's the connection here remember the prophet said he was a typologist [Music] I love typology it makes the Bible reality [Applause] and the prophet told us [Music] that if he had time he could have preached even since from Genesis because the message is the key that opens the Bible we no longer read the Bible as denominations the Bible became the new a new books it is The Book of Life when we read it you see Jesus Christ you see yourself wherever and don't see yourself foreign [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] she brought forth a generation of bastards everybody that's why you need to be born again Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Music] man he was just an introducer of you to Jesus yes yes you can sail I came again when I realized when I discover he's a descendant of Esau he's found in Israel yes because there is a Gentiles could get into Israel through laws of redemption is [Applause] someone in Leviticus hallelujah praise be to Jesus and we see God had commanded Moses to send them spies [Music] get things but I want you to realize something here God had a plan it's not that God didn't know that he told Moses to send uh 12th wife [Music] Israel had come from because the land that God had given to Abraham Isaac and Jacobs [Applause] it is not another Holy Ghost it is the same holy ghosts arises because it is the same Holy Ghost Jesus Christ God I am God I am God I change you know Hallelujah man we are not receiving another Spirit throughout the church yes God is very precise [Music] [Applause] they were children of Joseph foreign [Applause] [Applause] his daughter-in-law [Music] [Applause] another gentle woman [Music] the woman in the game David had many wives he had many ships hallelujah amen he says the husband of this woman must have died your first husband I mean Romans must be possible are we together [Music] in my throne Andy foreign Hallelujah [Applause] foreign Hallelujah are you seeing Perfection as something difficult or are you seeing a promise amen that is not your work not your efforts you are his workmanship way yeah [Music] God had confidence this is foreign [Music] Hallelujah [Music] whatever that is inside of us or whoever that is inside of you if it is Jesus Christ so the ten spies and I want to show you here spies in your own individual life spies are the five senses of the flesh are the five senses of the spirit they were given you they were gifts but they were not given to guide you Hallelujah was so much close to Joshua foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] are you following me oh hallelujah hallelujah I'm trying to keep my time so these guys when they saw it yeah because he knew his God he remembered he looked at his experiences he remembered the pledge in Egypt remember God took you from times when the Devil comes and preaches to you and he tells you you're not a Christian remind him oh I was a sinner and I could not save myself Hallelujah I did not save myself I did not deliver myself this is all about Jesus was all about Jesus everything in my life he's the principles and that's why the message but this was the first Exodus which is just a type we are in the reality um it came to our time and then had to come he had come to cross over to take the landsc he reminded Joshua what Moses and you need to remind Joshua to remind the Holy Ghost what the message says the message cause you an eagle amen the message that does not call you a failure and more than a conqueror that's what the message it's not [Music] foreign foreign [Applause] chocolate [Music] yes sir wow it is in our family twice you will not be the first person to go in the room one of our great great grandfathers hallelujah amen he changed dimensions we are not talking about something that has never happened before there's nothing new Under the Sun when you talk about the Rapture it's not a mythical no it has happened [Music] you will see our families we are not patients what what family are you talking about foreign because you're not Guided by anybody else you're not Guided by anybody else but the super sense the Holy Spirit Joshua don't listen to The Times wise for what it is after all Paul tells us Flesh and Blood are not inherit the Kingdom the five senses [Music] Musa the land is [Music] but remember [Applause] he has hmm [Music] the message is that's why the Bible says it doesn't say as it was in the days it doesn't say but in the days of the Seven Angels he doesn't say like that go and read the Bible it doesn't say in the days of the 70s the Bible says but in the days of the voice but in the days the angel may not be here but his voice the book of summer the book of someone is someone died in first somewhere yes foreign bring another message uh-huh merry because every person who brings another message what you need to possess this language for you to overcome the animals came back again with other nations they were Seven Nations comes back to the old house but they did not move colors foreign he saw the promise look the Bible says he fully followed the word bible the government in other words he took the full word we have the full world the message opened the book we are going in by every word man fell because he failed to obey one word for us he followed the whole world that cloud is is rocket fuel foreign foreign [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] have you ever known something whatever in that image of Daniel H Furniture danieri where did that that stone hit a ginger yeah that was cut without the hand of a man where did that the temples the five senses of the flesh with five senses of the spirit that stone was the Holy Ghost brother you need to die Paul says I died in them and you die means the five senses of the flesh five senses they are not in control of you but the super senses foreign Hallelujah I hope I get it quickly amen I mean I hope I'll get it quickly wing we are grateful to God that we have the five senses to see my new cartoon but by no means there was these Five Sisters given you to guide you name they were given you for ethnic contacts to contact the three dimensions but this was given you but there was giving you the sixth sense and that Sixth Sense belongs to uh let me jump hallelujah hallelujah and the super sense of the holy spirit of God that dwells in you if you let the five senses build them singing it will guide you and bring you all up and bring all the other five senses under control for it's as far as high as the heavens is [Music] so they have done something for it as so far above the natural sense as the spiritual man is above the Natural Woman it's as far as high as the heavens is it makes you act where you don't think the five senses would ever think about it is he says here the devil can get into these five senses but he cannot touch that Superstar so every people every person category Moon too that is deceived by false doctrines it means they don't have the super sense because if you have the super sentence that's far beyond is Rich that come from God Cafe it's called faith is that great thing you know hallelujah praise be to Jesus to find a place where is the Holy Spirit by that same sense God spoke when there was nothing [Music] God created the heavens by the super sensors Hallelujah hallelujah oh when you have the Super Saiyan you have the
