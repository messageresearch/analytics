been spoken other unoken the one here to you come and speak to us come IND maying on The [Music] Zo end Jesus amen even I'm to see I take brothers are to because they today we reading out the book [Music] of ask me to minister on the zoom yes [Music] I have say myk so I have a lot of scriptures read specifically out of the message three kinds of believers and that is the I speak on this so for the first time I'm going to not for the first time but maybe one of those first I'm going to faithful one message say that PR is preing only one message also say that he should not give his own by should from [Music] so we are taking the reading from the book of johnes when they this say this is this ising he it when Jesus knew himself M he said them off you quick speakto you are and they are some of you not Jesus knew from the beginning who they that not and who should betray him and he you that can come unto me except were given unto him of my father [Music] [Applause] [Music] spe [Music] [Music] and we will also read from 66 to vers 71 from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then J then said Jesus unto the twel would you also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life and we believe and assure that thou art that Christ the son of the Living God Jesus answered them have I have not I chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil he spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon for he it is for he it was that should betray him being one of the 12 amen you may be seated may the Lord bless the reading of his word tonight amen amen praise the name of the Lord so this evening I'm speaking on the three kinds of Believers and I'm re-echoing it so that it can get to your heart three kinds of Believers now you would imagine that there's only one type of a Believer butam text this title three kinds because there are three kinds of people called Believers and as we shall see it in details one is a make believer and one is a nonbeliever or an nonbeliever and one is a u um um a real believer I begin with the introduction here reading out of of a portion I'm going like I said I'm going to read out of this message quite a lot please give me your undivided attention because these things are very very important the time uh the season where we have reached or arrived in time this message is very important and after today if you can go back and and uh listen to it our Prophet brother bam preached this in 1963 I'm sure it will be a blessing to you amen he says the first is Believers make Believers and unbelievers now that is quite a subject but ass sure as we sit here tonight that group always is gathered [Music] together when I first heard this I was shocked I had left my Anglican church and I was in a believer's church people who believed the end time message and then when I heard brother bam say these words confused me I like I thought I came to real powerful like real genuine believers [Music] mean that even among the churches or even the group of Believers of the message of the hour these three groups are still there the answer is yes he says as sure as we sit here tonight that group is always always gathered together wherever the people gather we find this group and always have found them and we probably will always find them until the coming of the Lord and I want us tonight to picture ourselves as I speak of these three groups I want you to picture yourself as one of those three groups so listen carefully and as you are listening try to picture yourself as one of the three group now remember he says I'm speaking here to maybe this church and he says but I'm also speaking to the world around while I also speak to the church here physically I'm speaking to those on the YouTube I'm speaking to the Saints at evening light on the on the zoom so this is it cuts across and as our Prophet says in all different parts of the world these step culate through Ministries now I want to speak of the three different types of Believers now now remember Believers my subject is Believers one of them is a True Believer and the next is a make believer and the next is a unbeliever and I have a few comments here he says you know we live in evil times you know it's darker I want to tell you it is darker now than it was 60 years actually it is 61 years ago when this message was first preached by brother 61 years ago when people come to church they often many times have a mindset you know that everyone is a real believer I look over there our sister who is recently baptized you know when you come to church many times you think oh I've joined a group of people who are all real Believers because they look like one but I want to say that is not true so I'm giving a disclaimer tonight our church is not a church of only real Believers well if you want if you want you can say Amen if you want you may leave it but the truth look at the church as a hospital where you have different categories of patients and these patients are suffering from different and various diseases some patients will eventually die these are the nonbelievers some may never get well but they will linger and stay for a long time these are the make Believers and others will certainly recover and they will get quickened they will get energized they will get revived they will get restored and these are the real genuine Believers now when you come to church look at Christ the word as your example don't look at your fellow patients many people have done that mistake they look at their fellow patience as examples we are all patience you should not look at one another as example we should look at our healer Jesus Christ the word that is our example Jesus Christ the word is our healer in this Hospital Jesus Christ is our healer and he uses doctors the preachers to treat us so these doctors the preachers are not healers they only treat but God the word the Holy Ghost he is the Healer now many get offended and they leave the fellowship because another person offended them it is like a patient running away from the hospital before their fellow patient has why are they running away because their fellow patient has a smelly wound you don't know what you're doing you are running away from a place of Refuge you running away from where you will be healed now whether your fellow patient has a smelly wound let him mind his business mind your own business amen as long as you are in the right place where the Healer does his work where he has sent his doctors the preachers then he will accomplish the work in your life others ask help guidance and councel from their own fellow Believers it is like a patient asking another patient how much injections how much tablets it's like a patient asking a fellow patient how much injections and tablets they should take [Music] according to my condition how much injection do you think I should take how much taet do you think I should swallow you can imagine what will happen this other patient will give you poison you know it is right medication but it is given wrong proportions you need a doctor to prescribe that medication the doctor is the only one authorized to treat us you Believers are patient go to the right office when you are faced with a spiritual or physical challenge go to the right office to seek for cel seek for help not everyone is Anointed qualified to help you they may be looking good they may be in the same church as you are but not everyone is Anointed and qualified to help you that's why the Bible says God has sent pastors teachers prophets amen evangelist you know pastors what are they for they are here to edify the body they are here to help the church they are the doctors you know brother bam talks about Peter as the Doctor Who prescribed the right medication for the church in Acts chapter 2 he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ and your sin shall be forgiven and you will receive the gift of the ho ghost so you see was Dr Peter giving a prescription as as according to the Healer so you see if you go and ask counsel from anyone because they look good some people when they are poor and they squeezed to the world they go to a brother who is Rich they got a sister who is Rich guide me what can I do they may be rich they may not know how to make you rich but you see you have to go to the Lord and the Lord has set in the church they write office for that many times people have problems in their marriages they are calling friends they are calling friends they're calling mother-in-laws they're calling you know you know so and so that's a wrong thing to do go to the right office God is God God is able God cannot fail but you see you have to follow his principles if you don't follow his principle he is not responsible for your condition but if you follow God's principle he will always be responsible for your situation and he will always prove himself to be a living God and a God who answers prayer and a God who is fful praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen and so see the first group is the Believers amen and we see Peter and the disciples was the was was the type of the real believer and we find them here in John 6 67 where he says then said Jesus unto the 12 will you also go away then Simon answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life and we believe and assure that you are the Christ the son of the living and I want to say the believer will always believe the word the believer will always say to whom shall we go the believer Noh else to go when you have a problem you have nowhere else to go when you are sick you have nowhere else to go when you have confusion you have nowhere else to go but to the Lord amen you because why he has words of eternal life and he said we believe and we assure how many believe and assure the Bible says that he that comes to God must believe that he is and he's a rewarder of those who diligently seek we believe and we are sure we do not believe just for just we believe with all our heart and we are sure that this Bible works that our God works he's a living God he can never fail the Bible says all those who trust in him shall never be confounded we believe and we are sure amen and in paragraph six it says for not only did he have the words of life he was the words of life he was the words of life and Simon thoroughly recognized this how many recognize this tonight amen and when he recognized it that that was the that was what that kept his hold recognizing that that Jesus that he is the word of life it will keep your hold of him because it was revealed to him that he was the Living Word I have a testimony this evening it is revealed to me he is the Living World I cannot find life anywhere else I cannot find life in denominations I cannot find life in Creeds in dogmas in organizations but my life is in the living world amen amen now that is a genuine believer let me tell you you believe if you believe the word you will know one thing the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere in any situation at any time the word of God can never fail if you a Believer if you're a genuine believer you will believe that to be the truth hallelujah amen when the Holy Spirit not some someone persuading some other person I'm not here because I was persuaded persuaded me to be here hallelujah hallelujah amen that is why sometimes preachers get anointed when they get into the world and they tell you if you don't want go away and you think he doesn't like people no it's only because God loves genuine believers who will have a backbone to stand and believe every word of God praise the Lord but when the Holy Spirit has revealed to you the word itself let me tell you Brethren the Holy Spirit reveals the word to you we don't believe this by some persuasion or whatever the Holy Spirit has revealed it and you see the word made plain you see the word Vindicated then the spirit of God come getting to that agge for the word of that age and he makes it manifested Oh Glory to God how can a man kept from believing Luther how can a man be kept from believing Luther if he had known that Luther was a reformer the spirit the man's Spirit went forth there for information you know there are four living creatures anointings amen the face of man the ox and and um what else the the the flying ego and what else the lion and so we Noti that in the first age the anointing of a lion and then after that came the ox then after that came the the the the face of man the intelligence knowledge wisdom and then after that comes the flying ego anointed now we are living in the age of the flying ego anointing we are the church going to go in the Rapture when the enemy comes in like a flly the spirit of God raises a standard the standard is going to raise for our generation is not to die no more than our anointing is to fly away that is the standard God is going to raise for Our Generation soon and very soon we are going to see the king we shall have no more suffering no more pain we will see the king we will be perfect even as he is but in the days of Luther anointing that they had of reformation no man could be kept away from it after the Lord had made it manifest Before Their Eyes even in the days of Wiz the same way the people at that time had to believe it that was the message to that church age that was exactly what was to happen was to take place you had to believe it and here we are now down in the laudation church age and we are taugh in the Lan age that Christ was put out of his church and was even knocking on the door trying to get back in this is the situation Our Generation so when we see that happening we know what age we are living in churches who claim to believe in Jesus but they have kicked the word out of their churches Christ is out of the Church Believers who claim to believe in Jesus but they don't leave their lives according to the word have kicked out Jesus out of their life and he says he's out of the church he's outside and he's knocking on the door and then we see what time we are living in and then we are at the closing of the history of the world take a moment and think about it we are at a time of the closing of the world the history of the world the book is now being finished the last line will be root across it some and she will be closed up then the time shall be no more and there is a great drama being set amen and angels are standing over the sky I don't believe brother bam was just saying this he's a prophet a someone who was seeing things and he said flying sers are investigative [Music] Angels until today you go go on and Google eat flying sers people see things and they they don't even know even Pentagon sometimes can't explain they don't they just see things it just comes and disappears and our Prophet says it is investigating Angels they can't even their rather can't determine what it is exactly let me tell you our Prophet was able to see these things and he say the drama is being said and he says angels are standing over the skies they are watching you know what a drama is the actors are ready you can see them acting you can see the evil one acting you can see the villain of the play you know the villain you know that is the one who is the antagonist and then the protagonist and you know the villain is the bad guy the bad guy of the movie yes that's the right word and you know brother bam says you can see the villain of the play the evil one he also acting how he's come on the SE and he has come with his kindness to deceive but you know what the El cannot be deceived hallelujah hallelujah but you can see also the raptured church making herself ready it is a great SE angels are waiting the devil is fighting coming to the SE and you see also on another side the church is going to be ruptured amen the Bible in the Book of Revelation 197 says the bride has made herself ready the church is also making herself ready are you part of that church you are making yourself ready that's why we come to church Wednesday night Friday night morning what are we doing we are making ourself ready ready for the flight soon and very soon sister you are coming here will pay off those who were laughing at you saying are they going to church to eat food will they receive their sat from church that is when they will know are coming here for a reason hallelujah amen and then we shall enter in and he shall say come in good and faithful s enter ye into the Jo of the Lord Brother sister I cannot wait for that when that moment comes I will rejoice I might as well begin rejoicing right now that time is coming for oh Hallelujah am and when we get over there oh Glory we shall rejoice am glory and the prophet continues on here and he says you can see the church making herself ready and it's a great [Music] scene amen you can see the presence of God and we see it here every service vindicating and making the great drama is for here in this Bible act itself out what a time to leave the most glorious time the man of all ages has longed for this time the prophets of old they long to see this but they were not privileged you are privileged to be in this time to be in this hour Oh Glory Hallelujah now there was a Believer because he seen it he believed it we are fully persuaded that thou the Christ the Messiah the word of God for this day we believe that that is a real believer we believe in one God that is a real believer we believe in water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ that is a real believer we don't believe in women wearing trousers that is a real believer we don't believe in me come on church that is the real believer we don't believe Amen in fornication Amen in immorality that is a real believer we don't believe in adultery come on church that is a real believer we believe in the Holy Ghost that is a real believer we believe in a changed Life free in the holy ghost that is a real believer we believe in the power of God power to heal the sick to deliver the B to Open the Eyes of the blind to make the lamb work again that is a real Bel we believe in the power that makes Habit St that is a real Bel and a real believer is a good patient in this Hospital Hallelujah don't you worry if you see some symptoms on me I am eating the medicine I am e what does he say in the word come come gold tried in the fire and also take for your what is this message it is what is the message it is gold in the fire as long as we are under the word the real believer will be Chas it doesn't matter our current situation brother sister ifine believer the word of God comes you say Amen say amen and day by day you are changing something is happening the life of Jesus is coming in your life you are being changed and you can be able to say the things I used to do I do them no more I am born again what is that that is a real believer Hallelujah woo yes sir oh come on on you can Rejoice Church the real Believers can Rejoice the real Believers can sh the real Believers can clap their hands and say glory to God why the word is settling in and then we have another group the unbeliever and we see those as says the 7 praise the Lord and I'll continue reading 139 it says then secondly there comes now the unbeliever let's speak of the unbeliever next what does the unbeliever do we see the believer what accepts the word every rest every generation from all the way from Noah the way all the way up we could take six months of of Revival on on that right bringing up the characters they believe amen the believer doesn't question the believer believes it regardless of what it sounds like or what anybody else has got to say about it how impossible it seems to be the believer believes it believes what the word not the Creed the word not the denomination the word not that some not what somebody else says what the word says now remember that is the believer the believer doesn't question the believer doesn't say how can it be it can get can it be explained [Music] that's the unbeliever it is the believer that no matter what it is if it is the word it is the word that is true that is the believer amen now the unbeliever now we see we will take up the unbelievers now we find out that they did all right as long as they get parted on the back and called Disciples as long as you you you encourage them it is all right it will be all right even if you are doing it is not wor the belever the unbelievers love inspirational preachers those ones who make them comfortable in their sin those on who don't condemn them those who don't judge them but you see the nonbelievers as long as everything went fine they were all right but when this Prophet that they believe to be a prophet that know was that could SEC excuse me what did he do when the real truth and the re come contrary to what the unbeliever believes they cannot take the word those are the ones who get offended when you preach the truth of the word if they are fornicating and you tell them fornication is a sin and fornicators are going to hell I don't want that that pass judgmental that is the nonbeliever but the believer if he was fornicating he the word God because to him the word is the word and he believes it and takes it the way it is are you hearing me church so the nonbeliever they can take miracles they can even perform them that no problem that they they went and cast out Devils they preached even the word and they were still unbelievers n Believers can even preach n Believers can even do Miracles but still non how do you know them by their life I don't care whether you preach Hell Fire or miracles happen your life shows who you really are an unbeliever cannot live the life of the word you see he sent them out two by two the servant and they cast out and he said I seen seven falling like like in from heaven and then they casted Devils but as soon as you know Judas was right with them and here comes the unbelievers as soon as Jesus begin to say he was something then he was the resurrection he was the life what would you say if you seen the son of man Ascend up from from where he come from now this man is trying to say he comes from Heaven that's too much for us we can't believe that he said what is it the flesh that you are talking about profit nothing it's the spirit that quickens there you are the spirit quickens the word it is the spirit not the the spirit of the Holy Ghost quickens the word to you and the nonbeliever cannot receive that Spirit of Truth and then when he comes he quickens and you become alive and there you are you see it by faith you see it you know it is so because the word said so and the spirit quickens the word to you now he said and as soon as we did this we find out the unbelievers when you say something that they don't agree with they walk right out on you I just want oh that's getting so dense it's getting so in the world today excuse me in the world it is getting so dense now they gather in I notice at meetings they gather in great crowds and you stand up and start saying something they just sit there just watching just waiting then as soon as you say now Jesus Christ identified himself as Messiah because he was a prophet that is done away it goes and where they go what is it unbelievers you say something it is in the word but instead of them receiving it they are offended have you not seen some of those people they just get offended off I'm offended you have offended me I'm speak about me it is impossible even these churches have left them I say will never come back he abused me unbeliever the unbeliever doesn't even wait around when the word is preached he is condemned and he walks out sometimes they even physically they walk away you even see them many times in services and this happens in every Church in the world during services when it begins to become so hot you see some people walking up those are unbelievers them when the you want the word is begin to get sweet this is where we enjoying and someone is walking out they're making themselves busy non believers why they are condemned by the word and they feel uncomfortable oh God and this message of the hour that we are now enjoying the presence of God the latter day the evening time when the lights are shining and the things that been open to us and the word Vindicated and the word Pro Pro to be the truth both prophesied comes to pass all through scientific and everything it proved it is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and a man walk out on that he is an unbeliever and the prophet continues he is beyond [Applause] hopes he is numed by the power of Satan so there is no hopes for he is beyond hopes there is no more grace because the revelation of the world in our generation is the highest form of Grace if anyone was to walk away from it no more hopes for them they are nonbelievers they unarmed by the power of Satan and there's no more hopes for oh God make me a and then we'll close it down with a make believer now what is that the believer now the true sorry now the unbeliever now the third class we are speaking about the third class that we speaking about is the make believer listen that is the boy I love the way brother make believer now remember in there stood all three now we find now they do just exactly like their father does Judas there was Peter and the rest of the Apostles Believers there was the 70 unbelievers and there was Judas he hung right on he was a make a believer what do they do this is the kind that holds on until they can find something a fa to e they are looking every time to find a loophole see how it's done see if it is a trick see if it's a gimmick they are waiting to be sold out they are looking for that the unbeliever he doesn't even wait around he's condemned and he walks out they believer no matter what happens he beli it it is the word there is your three classes the old unbeliever will walk out on the first thing that is said he don't like about it brother he's going to throw his colors right then he's an unbeliever Paul say they went out from us because they weren't a part of us in the beginning those are the ones who get saved they come to church hang around for a while why they offended by the word they started with us oh you did run well what hindered you they went out because they wer of us now the mega believer hangs around and acts just as Pious as he can and and brothers on the media when it is 1 hour let me know so I can praise the name of the Lord and ask just as Pious because I I lost track of my time here they are Pious as he can be but down in his he's trying to find what how you do it or if the country isn't full of that part of Hypocrites those are hypocrites that's a Judas he hangs around becomes part of the group and he says he was the treasurer he stands around he's always got his his hand out for money there are money lovers you can tell that one thing he's always fishing for M and he got his hand out for this he is a make a Believer but he acts like a believer you remember he wasn't fooling Jesus after the Sant left and the Believers made their stand he turned around to the Believers and he said there is still something in you he said I've chose 12 and one of you is a devil Jesus know from the beginning for he was the word he know the secret of the heart praise the name of the Lord how hard it was stop a minute think deep listen straight how hard it must have been on him excuse me walking right there and a man calling him brother and he knowed all the time that he was a deceiver that he was going to try to upset him and sell him for 40 pieces you think Judas didn't know himself he knew himself the make beli he is not a make Believer by accident he knows [Music] himself praise the name of the Lord how hard it was to hold it on his bosom and his friend walking along there and even he said friend called Judas his friend and you would think that Jesus was fooled have not I been with you all this time knowing in his heart and he couldn't say and this old hypocrite Jesus did not know Jesus knows each and every one of let me tell you church he is not about to kick out any make believer no he won't he never does the make believer is there for a purpose where they make saying they have not found me interpretation pring of the they never found me he knows you are there and he's even calling you friend don't think God is powerless God knows each and every one of you he knew it in his heart and yet he didn't say it he knowed from the [Music] beginning who it was that would betray there is that make believer that's just waiting is waiting he will sing that and say oh I believe this oh I believe this I believe this but you know I heard somebody say it is so and he says see just long with [Music] ears the mega Believers have long ears they are the ones who knows what is happening in everyone's [Music] marriage they know what is happening in everyone's home they are not deacons they are not Pastors make [Music] believers they ears Al they hear what everyone says they know who is bad and who is worse [Music] everything they have long ears oh God have mercy I believer doesn't hear anything but the word that is all God I am not in charge to hear stories I am not in charge to hear who did I am in charge to hear the word of God I come to church to be changed to be liberated I don't care what who did I care what Jesus did for me that's all he watches the word he ain't looking for no loopholes Believers will be the first to say I'm telling you the church is about to fall this church is I know I tell you you see that sister bad news look at brother now he's singing he's cry I tell you make a Believer he's looking for Loop he's always the one talking to others about people if you are here and you are like that make a Believer but you know what it may be a spirit of make on you God can change you repent genuinely he you know the real believer is not looking for gimmicks he believes God and that settles him he just keeps going on there is the believer Hallelujah the unbeliever fills up in a minute and he can't stay to listen 10 minutes of the message he goes out to get and walk out it's against his greed and he just want have no more to do with it so he goes out then they make a beli hangs right on that Judas see that's the deceiver that's rasco if I have to say such a word Judas he hangs around this is the time sometime these me Believers are very popular with people are you not wondering you know things that the prophet talked about them they are very po with the people that's right these make believer some of them are Mighty Men educated doctor's degree big pay everything some of them are good man shrew just like sons of sat and I'm going to close it on Zoom here tonight and then we we conclude here at the church so if you give me a moment I pray for the Saints who are listening in on Zoom there many Saints who have been listening Lord perhaps someone is a makeever but I pray that you help them wherever it is Lord Jesus may you give them your grace may they find you Lord and perhaps even here Lord we know that all things are possible you can change even the V of sin Grant it father I pray in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah hallelujah will you just give me about 10 10 more minutes and I I'll be done praise the name of the Lord some of them are Mighty Men educated doctor's degrees big pay everything some of them are great men they're shrew just like sons of Saturn would be look how Satan come right there and agree with every bit of that [Music] word he's just waiting to find that weak spot in Eve to where he could show his power to deceive her to betray her that was Satan and here Satan is is in the form of Judas in that age that was certain in the first age what was he agreeing with the word not believing it the word agreeing with the word with a word not believing agreeing with the word just one little thing he's trying to find a place where he can get a weakness you are saying you are believers but when I see this one his marriage I see this one I see thisen we are not here to see people we are here to see the word hallelujah amen and that's exactly what Judas finds right now he will come right along with the meeting and watch right around until he can find that little spot oh there it is that's it that's the way it is done just exactly and I want to finish tonight with a story that gives of make believer you are going to be amazed but the BAM says many of you remember up there at that night when that man came out on the platform and you know brother bam had a gift of designment where he would tell people their names their address their problem and he would pronounce them heal if they had any problem and so you would be able to detect each and every sickness by the power of the Holy Spirit but here is a story of a me believer who came in church he thought that there was a mental telepathy of reading the prayer [Music] card brother bam campaign he had little prayer cards where in the ear days they would write the sicknesses of the people that is before he started to have the the designment when he was just using the gift of the hand and so in the middle there so sometimes they would still write the needs and so you thought that there was a so this man came and you know he thought brother bam was reading the prayer card and so brother he was sure he had it and he come around he belonged to a church that don't even believe in this in the gospel the Full Gospel and he came up on the platform I was tired they was fixing to take me away that was at winds Ontario in Canada in there come right across from the United States this man he came right from Detroit in wind at he came in America and this man come up there with a gray suit on and a red tie intelligent looking man smart as a tack he come to the platform and he walked up and I said well just let me have your hand I said I'm tired I've seen so many Visions just let me have your hand and I never noticed the man and he put his hand over on M and I said sir there is nothing wrong with you go ahead go go he said there is two and I said well let me see there I said no sir there is not one sign no sir you are a healthy man he said go look at my prayer card I said I don't care what you put on your prayer card I don't have nothing to do with the prayer card you know not you know I was tired and wore out but by the grace of God you see still there the grace of God was still there you remember if he sends you if God sends you it is his obligation to take care of you it ain't mine it is him he sent it I'm just supposed to stand on what's true when Moses threw his sck down it turned into a serpent The Magicians did the same thing what could Moses do but stand there and wait for the grace of God that is all same thing and that's what we do as preachers we preach the word and we stand there and we wait for the grace of God if the bible promises healing I preach healing and then I wait for the grace of God Amen I preach Miracles and then I wait for the of you know it's not my obligation to do it it is God who gave the word and he says and you know what happened don't you this man said now he said there he is look at my prayer card I said well you might have had a lot of faith and might have done it not thinking you know I was saying that and I wasn't even paying attention then he un buttons his coat and he pushed out his chest and he said to the audience and I thought what's going on there he looked around he said there you are see the gimick that is your Judas religious man a preacher of a great denomination he said there you are I had so much Faith now he's got so weak he can't read the telepathy he didn't even come to him no more and there he said it's not my faith was so great it is not my faith was so great said I put that on my prayer card and now he can't catch you see that's the and brother is standing all embarrassed you know what that means to an international evangelist someone who is believed to have a gift of God and someone comes and embarrasses him like this to prove that he's not a genuine you know brother if you're genuine believer stand with the word God will always give you the grace he can never let those who trust in him to be [Music] confounded never and I thought what is going on and then the grace of God came and I said sir why has the devil put in your heart [Music] to try to deceive God a Judas I said and then began to design him let those who say was a first preacher they are playing with fire and they says you are of the Church of Christ and said oh excuse me well I've already said it he didn't want to say the name but he said you of the Church of Christ preacher he was even a preacher you belong to the Church of Christ and you from the United States and that man sitting up there with that blue suit on and your wife sitting there you sat together that man and your wife at the table last night that man that has a green thing over it I spread you know it says around where you sat there was like a spread a green sheet and you made up that this was telepathy and you were coming tonight and that man raised up he said that's the Havey on me I said sir now this is the real designment now the man wrote things on the paper even look at but he begins to read what is there what this man was calling telepathy don't despise the supernatural whether it is a prophecy T interpretation the word God is God despise not the supernatural always believe the super and I said sir you put TB and cancer on that c and now you have it it is your now T and canc remember the man didn't have it he wrote it to confuse he thought brother bam was reading the mind and he grabbed me by the pants and he said I said I and I said I can't help you you go right ahead that's up between you and God you wrote your doom right on your [Music] car and that got him that was all of it see make believers trying to find fault with God and His word that is the Judas that's the ones you see how Judas come out Judas you see how he come out how that guy come out that's the way the make Believers happen make believers they highly educated sometimes and a good shown come between the word and their Creed when it does they sell out to their denomination like Jud Jud sold out to his denomination so Jesus he sold the word to his denomination he betrayed Jesus Christ after he claimed to be a part of the word ministers sometimes claiming to be Servants of Christ and when the word and we have seen them sometimes they have come even in this message 30 years and above and then they say why I left the message then they begin to find errors with the message then they begin to find questions with the message I have always said this whatever they claim that they know from the it is because of the message of William Bram we are not followers of William Bram we are followers of Jesus Christ the message of brother Bram pointed us to the word there is no way we can reject that message and claim to believe in Jesus and the word and reject the message of we are make Believers if we try to do that and brother Bram never preached anything new all the teachings all the revelations that from the Bible remember he was Elijah the one that was supposed to Resto all Resto doesn't mean to bring something new it means to bring what was already there but was lost and this message restores the fullness of the world so we are real Bible Believers because of the message and I am not ashamed to say I believe the message of William Bram because it has pointed me to Christ that the denominations had taken away from me and I finish with this quote now it's the same quote I'm just finishing and he said and when these ministers they come claiming to be the Servants of Christ and when the word is Thoroughly identified to be Vindicated for that day that it is the message of the hour and they would sell out for [Music] popularity to their denomination they go back to their denomination that's exactly like Judas did they betrayed Jesus to the phes and that Spirit don't die so there that's Among Us Believers make a Believers and unbeliever see that's exactly they come right down and sold Jesus for 30 pieces of silver and many men will do it today for a meal ticket for an extra $100 a week they deny the word that's standing in the midst of them and B that that b their life this word our with a full word but they reject it they turn back to their denominations some of them go back right they go back to believe in the Trinity they go back to believing women preachers believing all these things that the Bible is against why because they make believer and then you like huh someone who was preaching this message for 30 40 years what happened don't be surprised it happened in the days of Jesus someone who you can say Jesus trusted more than anybody else you don't tell someone to keep the P if they not trustworthy Judas was a trustworthy he was a good man he hanged on when the S left he was around he was among them who said when Peter said where can we go to whom has the words of etal life was saying he was a me believer later on he showed where his true heart was his heart was on the money and when he got someone to give him 30 pieces of silver he said I collect it I'll collect it and then he went to Jesus and he said my Lord I love you very much he could not betray him by cutting off his head he still loved him so these people confusing are they Believers or not they make themselves believers and they around us and they they keep there they patients who never get well but they they around all the they never get well brother Des s to be a mega believer someone in church 2 years 5 10 their weakness which they had when they came to church they still have it you know me Pastor I have a weakness on this issue same weakness 10 years you're not changing you're not progressing you make a Believer for sure for sure until you truly repent and you say God I believe your word can change me you ought to believe that because believer believes what the word can do and then the word will accomplish cannot return unto God voice shall accomplish what let us start on our Fe the musicians can come God bless you hallelujah hallelujah i' would like I would like to pray for you if you can bow your heads you know sometimes the word is preached like it has been preached tonight and can even feel like oh that was about me the make believer would say is just targeting me hypocrite he's preaching that because he knows what I'm going through but a real believer will say oh God have mercy on me change me your word is able to change the real believer will break down he will not fear even to cry if he has to because he wants God to come down in their heart and bring the character of Jesus Christ the holy spirit is real he changes he he he molds he can M your character into his own character so if you You' like to say God I want I want you to remember me today Lord you know my weakness you know I want to change I don't want to be the Way I Am Lord I mer your name I don't want to
