[8:47] Jesus Christ and the Philippines

[10:08] and the Lord willing will have a part
[10:10] for on Sunday
[10:17] amen and so this evening I'm going to
[10:20] speak on the author and the finished
[10:26] you remember in second Corinthians it
[10:29] says for God who commanded the light to
[10:30] shine out of Darkness
[10:41] forgive the light of the knowledge of
[10:44] the glory of God
[10:48] in the face of Jesus Christ
[10:50] and then he says but we have this
[10:53] treasure in Athen vessels
[10:57] by the Excellency of the power may be of
[11:00] God and not of us
[11:06] we are troubled on every side yet not
[11:09] distressed
[11:11] we are perplexed but not in despair two
[11:15] times
[11:19] persecuted but not for seconds
[11:23] passed down but not destroyed
[11:27] and here Apostle Paul writes again the
[11:30] same one who had written the first words
[11:32] to the Corinthians who he writes again
[11:34] to the Philippians
[11:41] and here he says I thank God I thank my
[11:45] God upon every remembrance of you
[11:52] always in
[11:54] prayer of mind for you
[11:58] or a knuckles
[12:02] for your fellowship the gospel from the
[12:07] first day until now
[12:14] being confident
[12:18] now here is where Paul's confidence was
[12:23] being confident of this very thing
[12:29] which has begun a good work in you will
[12:33] perform it until the day of Jesus Christ
[12:43] you see the greatest fear that the human
[12:47] race has is failure
[12:53] you know man usually fears failure
[12:57] some of you who are at school and are
[13:00] pursuing certain degrees or diplomas
[13:04] or certificates
[13:11] you know the devil the best thing he can
[13:14] bring to you is to bring you fear that
[13:17] you will fail at it
[13:23] and you see the devil will tell you you
[13:26] know you might not pass
[13:30] and the devil might tell you well you
[13:33] know you will not get the full amount of
[13:35] your tuition
[13:39] and maybe in the middle somewhere you
[13:42] may not make it
[13:43] [Music]
[13:45] and you know if you are having a job
[13:50] you know the devil may bring you fear
[13:53] that you see his job of yours foreign
[14:55] but if you don't make Google
[15:12] because this gospel you keep hearing
[15:15] everything
[15:19] we keep hearing that kind of gospel
[15:21] every day
[15:23] and you know the devil likes preaching
[15:26] the gospel of what if so
[15:30] yeah you know that's what it used to
[15:33] preach to Jesus
[15:35] you tell him if you are the son of
[16:17] and you know one thing that is not about
[16:20] the devil is
[16:23] that he does not know
[16:39] he wasn't too sure about who Jesus was
[17:00] killing but what if you failure
[17:05] what if that happens
[17:16] and I've come here today to preach to
[17:19] the true ghosts
[17:22] I've come here this evening to just
[17:25] simply tell you that Jesus Christ is the
[17:27] author and the finisher
[17:34] amen he's the author of my life

[17:42] it has all foreign
[17:47] [Music]
[18:11] [Music]
[18:28] do you really see him as somebody who is
[18:32] worried about his treasure
[18:38] he's not worried if he was worried he
[18:41] would have put some metallic something
[18:47] and then he would put his treasure in
[18:50] there
[18:51] lock it up with steel now
[18:54] and then he would you know put it
[18:56] somewhere where you cannot reach
[19:00] but you see do not do that because he is
[19:04] confidence
[19:05] it's not in the in the vessel
[19:09] his confidence
[19:14] confidence he's in the light pretty much
[19:18] as we saw is the treasure
[19:22] the light is the world
[19:25] the light is gone
[19:28] and that is actually Jesus Christ
[19:32] and he is the author and the finisher
[19:40] I am confident of this very thing
[19:44] that he which has begun a good work in
[19:47] you
[19:49] were performing
[19:51] everybody say he will perform it
[19:56] he will perform it

[31:36] when he says in the in the Ephesians

[31:50] now this is talking about uh Revelation
[31:53] chapter one two and three

[32:16] those two things are similar but they're
[32:18] different and internet

[33:10] Hallelujah I mean
[33:12] power our entire mind is to make things
[33:15] happen amen

[33:23] of God
[33:26] Jesus being on the right hand of the
[33:28] Throne of God yes
[33:31] it means he's on the right hand it means
[33:34] he has the power and he has the
[33:38] authority
[33:41] [Music]
[33:42] for Jesus to be on the right hand of the
[33:45] Throne of God yes

[34:22] possession by their own sword yeah
[34:24] neither did neither did their own arms

[34:51] and you remember a lot of something we
[34:53] read in Corinthians
[34:57] which said
[34:59] we are okay says that
[35:03] to give the light of the knowledge of
[35:05] the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[35:07] Christ
[35:11] and here he says
[35:16] [Music]
[35:21] because thou has had a favor unto them
[35:28] so now the truth of Israel he did not go
[35:32] into the Promised Land by their own
[35:33] swords
[35:36] they didn't get out of Egypt because of
[35:39] how they how well they knew how to fight
[35:44] they didn't receive a breakthrough
[35:46] because of how strong their hand was
[35:53] listen to me the children of Israel

[40:10] the revelation of the world
[40:19] when we say the word of God because
[40:29] theater
[40:34] there is a revelation
[40:41] and in our days
[40:57] that shines
[41:00] and we can be able to see clearly
[41:20] there is nothing in the Bible such as
[41:22] women preachers
[41:27] those who do not know that they are in
[41:29] darkness
[41:31] but those who knows they are those who
[41:34] have had the message of the messenger
[41:39] so they are not working in darkness
[41:44] they are working in their life
[41:51] and we are able to know what the
[41:53] original sin was that is
[42:09] and that was the beginning of Sorrow
[42:18] and we were able to know
[42:21] the the the horse riders
[42:29] [Music]

[44:16] in Our Generation all these Messengers
[44:21] they didn't have their own life
[44:24] that's why they did not start their own
[44:26] churches or denominations
[44:37] reflected light from Jesus Christ
[44:50] that made me walk in the light of their
[44:53] spots
[44:57] it is night for that is when the stars
[45:01] come out or whatever
[45:04] it is the night of the Blackness of sin
[45:07] we're able to awake
[45:09] today for all even the whole world
[45:13] the Bible says the whole world all have
[45:16] sinned and are constantly falling short
[45:18] of the glory again
