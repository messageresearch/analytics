want his presence we want his word to come he cannot speak to you unless you're prepared are you prepared this even remember it is for you he died it is for you he gave himself to die on the cross of and that's why we have come to worship him we have come in this service to be brought closer to him we believe in the Rapture the catching away of the Bride so we have come in his house in his presence today to be prepared for that moment so cast every imagination every thought aside and let him draw you in welcome him receive him in your heart [Music] for my sake you became a curse and you

are so grateful Lord for what you have done for us even to call us your beloved even to bring us closer and now Lord as we have gathered around your word this evening B our hearts together around this holy word Lord Jesus that you come and speak to us come and use us Lord we are just a Vel father but may you take this vessel and use it to speak to your children those who are thirsty may you feel them Lord the hungry may you feed them Lord Jesus may we get out of this place today uh give thanks in our hearts saying our hearts were burning within us the Lord spoke to us you speak to us Lord out of your word I commit the service into your hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen the Lord bless you Saints amen I'd like to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ uh shall we turn to our Bibles um we will read again Genesis chapter 25 um so this evening I'm also speaking to evening light bright Tabernacle they streaming this on Zoom so um I want to greet the Saints at evening light uh so our service this service that I'm preaching on Zoom is also being preached to the Saints here at dvf and also those who will be listening to this on on YouTube so to to those of you who are here there are more here than than than a part of than I here so are we ready for the Lord to speak to us we are reading out of the Book of Genesis chapter 25 and uh we shall read the verses we read on Sunday this is supposed to be like part two of of the thought I ministered on on Sunday um so brother just asked me to minister to the Saints I thought it is fine it can yeah so let us begin from vers 21 to 24 if you there say Amen [Music] and Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife because she was Barren and the Lord was in intreated of him and Rebecca his wife conceived and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am I thus and she went to inquire of the Lord and the Lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two man of people shall be separated from the Bo and the one of the people shall be stronger than the other people and Elder Shall Serve the younger and when her days to to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in a womb and the first okay I think we just end it for amen you may be seated so usually when I'm speaking to the Saints on Zoom I take not more than one hour so uh this service is not going to be a long service how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord amen uh I don't know why you would want to sit behind the pillar when so two Nations two manner of people so we begin with this verse 21 which says Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife because she was barren you know we have many examples in the Bible of women that were [Music] baren but all those women who were baren they eventually gave birth so I believe that if someone is baren it is because the Lord wants to manifest his glory but the Bible says ask and you shall receive so if you're listening to me and you are baren there have been instances where husbands intreated the Lord for their wives and there have also been times when the women themselves went before the Lord like we know of scario where Hannah went before the Lord she cried out to the Lord she said no Lord enough is enough I need a son and if you give me a son I'll give her and the lord gave him a son you remember how the prophet the man of God came and spoke to her and I say that whatsoever you you desire God has given to you and there have been another scenario of manoa's wife who did not also have a child who later on gave birth to Sam Hannah gave birth to Samuel the the prophet and manoah's wife gave birth to Samson a great man in Israel and now we we see many other examples also Elizabeth Elizabeth also gave birth to John remember elizabe Elizabeth was also baren Elizabeth was a wife of a priest even bar so and and then Elizabeth gave birth to John after the encounter with the angel of the Lord so you see women in the Bible who were baren it is because they were going to bring forth someone great into this life that's why you should always watch women who are Buren and they give birth later those children they give birth too are usually something in this life having a very big work to do in this life so if you're married and you are baren or it has been difficult for you to have a child over a period of years and you were a true child of God you're standing right with the word and you are listening to me right now I want you to just know it is because God has a great plan and if you know of someone who is in that condition tell them God has a great plan and so we find here there's another person who was bur and that is Rebecca Rebecca was the wife of Isaac and you remember how Isaac was able to get Rebecca as a wife it's a long story but you Bible readers know it how God spoke I mean how the the father of Isaac Abraham spoke to elzar and told him go among my people and among my Kindred and and find a wife for my son he told him touch my son he said swear that you will go among my people because the man was about to die so he said swear that in other words even if he's dead not will carry out the instructions he has been given said swear that you'll get a wife from my son among from among you know this is before the New Testament before the New Testament God has always desired that you marry from among your people and our people as Believers are believers God wants you brother to marry from among people and your people are believers your people are not Thea some people you you know they they like lifting up their tribes and some people think that their tribes sometimes or their tribes are superior to other tribes there there are no tribes among the Gentiles that are superior to other tribes we all PE we dos before God you remember what Jesus told that woman he said that how can I take the food of children and give it to dogs in this sense he was meaning the Jews are the children the Israelites and the Gentiles are the dogs you understand so in other words before God we are all the same and we were all rejected but by grace and by for knowledge he predestinated us unto Sons so we are children of God we are no longer dogs we are children can you say I'm a child of God and so among us we have different tribes and different you know tribes around the world and around even in this country humble yourself there is not tribe speedier than another one and and in every culture of of all these tribes there are real issues that Believers need to be delivered out of and if you very careful you look at each tribe and when I look at you here I see several tribes Naturally Speaking if you look carefully you had people saying that oh this tribe they are good adulterers oh this tribe they are good witches oh this tribe they are this or that tribe they are this if you look at what they saying is really true because they say those words after many years of observing and and you will find that this tribe they're very good with with bewitching this Tri they very good with with adulter others are others you understand and and if I mentioned these Tripes some of you will be offended at you but that's the reality it is the truth if you look at it in the natural sense that is why as children of God we are delivered from being a part of those tribes we should never have those kind of tribal sentiments Among Us when it comes to marriage you as a believer number one priority is first to seek a brother or a sister that is Holy Feld that has the birth that is chain that is a citizen of another country that is filled with the Holy Ghost that is exactly like you are but if you don't do that you are risking your entire life with someone who is from one of the tribes and that is very dangerous so so you know this man told I think it was Abraham Abraham told go from among my people and find a bride for myself my people our people are the Believers the Believers of the world not just the Believers because we have many intellectual Believers the Believers that are filled with the Holy Ghost the Believers that have the birth right those are the manner of people Believers should Mar for can I hear on that now SOA went and he found a wife you know the story on how he found her and her name is Rebecca so now Rebecca came you know they asked her whether she wanted to go she said yes I wanted to go and she came and met Isaac in the field not at home but in the field Midway and the Bible talks about us meeting Christ in the air oh my so the marriage of Isaac and Rebecca is also a type of the marriage of Christ and his church we are going to meet Christ not in heaven not on us we are meeting him we are meeting him in the air the Saints of all ages the Bible says they shall resurrect amen and then we who are remaining and alive I don't know whether you are going to die but for me I will be alive and remain I believe I actually believe the Rapture will find me I'm not preparing to die anytime soon then I and you who are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment in the tling of an eye and the Bible says we shall meet the Lord in the air how we will go in the air I don't know but the Bible says we shall meet him in the air and then we will go with him and ever be with the Lord so that is a type here of the marriage between Isaac and Rebecca so Rebecca is the type of a bride and Isaac is the type of the Bride praise the Lord so rebecc is the type of the church see I'm trying to progress something to you here then we see that Isaac had a wife but his wife was Buren his wife did not have a child and Isaac went before the Lord and prayed he said my wife is B he intreated I don't not know which words he used but he must have talked to the Lord about it if you have a matter disturbing you if you are the manner of people that is on the side of God you can always talk to to God about talk to God about it God answers prayer tell your neighbor God answers prayer Rebecca the Bible says his wife conceived and the children struggle together within her that's now where we are going to get into our praise the name of the Lord excuse me now see it says that the children fought and they struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am I thus and she went to also inquire of the Lord glory to God I'm excited because I'm seeing many things here I'm reading about Rebecca but I'm seeing the Church of Jesus I'm also seeing myself as an individual you know Rebecca was a Church of Christ but in wom was two children and these children were fighting and and she Al went to inquire over and the Lord said unto her two nations are in th two of people shall be separated from th B and the one people shall be stronger than the other and the Shall Serve the younger and when our days came to be delivered were fulfilled there were twins in our wom and on Sunday I talked about twins and I said this was just a personal opinion I said I would never desire to deliver twin why because you every time you find twins in the Bible well there is a problem with one of the twins you look at Kan and Abel there was a problem with Kan you look at now es and Jacob had a problem you look at every time they are twins there is issues but we notice here that when she had twins in our wom and and I maybe read this again to give the pr especially for the now remember each church has its formal and each church has its spirituals that's the twins that's born in every Revival and lives and sorry and lives in every church right they started right in this age talking about the Ephesian Church see that former religion there is no difference between that and Catholicism it's all the same thing every organization is butchered right into it and God never did organize his church that is exactly what they was trying to do here and you watch and see now if that's isn't right it just shows you how cast an organization is it was foreign to the new church so brother here is talking about every Revival on Earth every Revival has had twins and these twins here is a True Vine and the true church and the false Church in the beginning of the church the first church AG when by the way when you see in the Book of Revelation every time he speaks to the church I'll just give you a little example here in the Book of Revelation chapter two chapter chapter two yes and vers one it says under the Ang of the Church of Ephesus these things there's something I want to show you here these things say he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who WTH in the midst of the seven golden cand I Know Thy works and thy labor and th patience and how can and how thou canot cannot bear them which are evil and thou tried them which say that they are Apostles and are not but you have found them Liars so this is the very first the beginning of the gentle church but right at the beginning there was the false Vine and the True Vine in the framework of the Christian church we are not talking about Muslims and and and and and and Christians and Christians are talking about the Christian church the church has a womb oh I should say the church is the womb and the church has always had those twins in within the framework of the Christian faith so here these we are calling themselves Apostles and yet they were Liars if you go in the second actually that very first church he talked about those that had the Deeds of the nians and he talked about the Saints who hated them and God said I also hate those so you see there was two churches growing parallel to each working together doing almost if you you don't have an understanding you will confus to you will confus to mean that all of them are the same in the Church of Jesus there are two seeds there are two twins and they are growing side by side you know if you look at the parable of the s The Good The Master of the field sold good seed and later on you know this bad one came and sold another SE night when men slept we can talk about that also look at how when the apostles died how you know the false this this false seed was by men who crept in Una and then before before you knew it there were two seeds growing side by side and then you know the servant say to the master should we go and and remove the Bad Seed he said leave it let it grow together because you may go to app The Good The Bad Seed and you may end up approaching the good one also let them grow together the time of the Harvest amen then The Bad Seed shall be removed and The Good Seed shall be taken into the let me tell you friends we we have arrived at that time we are at Harvest time we are in the end time that's why we called end time Message Church a time when the seed has mature when God is getting ready to send the angels harest The Good Seed there others will die in their organizations and in their systems because he said every organization is butchered right into it God never did organiz his church you know before I forget I'll tell you there's something going on right now you know there's a bill that has been uh you know debated in the parliament a marage the marriage bill the new marriage bill and so there have been men that have come up from different denominations and they have gone into the parliament to give their ideas on how um you know they their view of marriage according to the Bible and they have wanted some of those things to be legislated different denominations went there and there came up a man who claims to believe this message actually he went there and he and it was read that he's is representing the enti message church and his idea was that polygamy is also part of the scriptures should be also legalized and these men started speaking and one of the men from the inter religious Council you know made a comment talking about the message church as Rebels but you see does this man represent us does he represent us church he doesn't represent us but he's a twin we can't reject him to be our brother he's our brother he's our twin brother they claim to believe the message of brother brother they waving around the message of marriage and divorce and they claiming to believe things which the prophet never propagated it is a Revival this message is it's the Bri Ral but within this revival there must be another the one who is the bad one but I'm so glad I'm the one who is the good one Hallelujah the world will see her another twin and they will B us together but they don't know that is a Jacob somewhere there may be an yes we are all from the but I tell you what there isob in the hallelujah amen and pray for us because we are planning together with other pastors to go and make a statement and and also do a press conference do a press release go to the parliament I've already spoken to the the head of that committee who happens to be the uncle of brother Andrew and he has told he told us they close but he said we'll give you a moment give a chance when the other inter religious Council comes you will all come so by God's grace the Lord willing we are going to go there and we are going to show them no there is another twin in this revival two Nations people we are the other side the devil might try to project himself and I don't know why but usually the problem is with the older twins the one who comes first that is always a problem with him there was a problem with K he was the Elder there was a problem with with is he was the Elder and there was a problem with with Judas he was the Elder and Jesus said all those who came before me theves and robbers and and you know who went to the parliament first and if you want to see polygamy it started on the line of but I'm so glad there is a right kind of twin in every Revival there has been those twins every Revival produces twins the prop Hallelujah and and Isaac is well represented every time there's a Revival there is an es born and a Jacob born I was Wonder these people don't even have an idea they they have no idea of how many message Believers are in this country even we have no idea did you know that in the Christian faith the Believers of this ENT message in this country have a very huge percentage I believe we more than 200,000 Believers that's a huge number from among the Born Again [Music] Believers if we were to be an organization we would have been controlling some of the events in the government I see some of these ones who have only 100,50 because they have an organization system govern they have their headquarters they have bishop and think they have a big but the Believers are many many many more in this country and they came up a brother it was just an opinion and I just want to say this because I want to make a comment why don't we make a document an overall document and we list what we believe our there I gave a comment and I said I don't believe in that I said this is where our doctr are we don't need because if you the moment you begin to organize the first thing is going to be the a document which states our beliefs then the second thing is going to be let us elect our leaders then the third let us also be recognized by the government let us wear robes callers let us also ask for cars from the president the way other as I receiv and before you know it we have organized as prophet when they organized they die we may look disorganized but we are the most organized body in the whole world because the body of Christ is not disorganized the body of Christ knows where she's standing she's standing on the Solid Rock of Ages Rock of the world believe all over the world they believe in Malachi 4 they believe in baptism in Jesus name they believe in one God we don't need to debate about it but you know what he knows those who are his you remember God never even wanted the Jews to be counted we don't need to count the believer we don't need it the government may need it at some point we don't need it God doesn't need it because he knows those who are his hallelujah hallelujah every Revival produces Twins and we talked about uh the difference and we looked at the lon of es and we saw that es hated the B he was afraid of it he hated it but we see that Jacob Jacob loved Jacob like es were born in a family and both of them had bad elements in them we were born in this world like them we have bad elements in us but you know because we are the good twin there is something that we are hungry for a child of God no matter which family or tribe born in you are hungering for the bir you are not happy when you don't live right you cannot comfortable in sin you cannot continue in in a fallen Fallen back condition you cannot rest until something has happened now I want I I I I I I'm not going to read again what I read but I I want to read a portion of it he says so it didn't mean anything to es he despised it and the can believer today still despises that bir and the bir right is the holy spirit they canot believe a despises that or you would say them days are pass there's no such a thing as receiving the Holy Ghost anymore that was back in the apostles times you know say you have have you ever received the Holy I don't think a big deal I believe the message brother sister there is the true baptism of the Holy Spirit and if you are not sure then you need to be sure you need to be sure that you have it was then it is still now I had a great man say one time and I would read this he says he said Pentecost was only a scaffold work to the building and he said then after the building is made why we don't need those scaffold anymore at the end of the service I came and shook his hand and I I I made a compliment and I told him doctor I said I will agree with you that Pentecost was a scaffold one as long as we are building on it we still have to have the scaffold amen as long as we are still building is the building finished answer me Church the building is still being built that means we still need a scff and he says until you put the end of the spire on the tip top there you still have to have the and I'm glad tonight to be working on the building standing on the scaffold then we amen we still need the Holy Ghost we still need a bathro because we are still building the building have not concluded yet and the prophet said you know you can call them Holy Rollers you can call them anything you want to but you know they will not care for anything else but that b you know Jacob didn't care what it cost him if it was a mess Portage he was glad to give it to so it is with so is it with any man or woman that has been ordained to eternal life man that God has called to eternal life he's willing to sell out anything anything of the world to obtain that bir listen to me if you still desire certain things in the world you cannot have the birth if you still love that boyfriend or that girlfriend and you are not willing to release or let go you can never receive the if you're not willing to give up you know those bad videos bad music and going out bad places your heart doesn't like it but you want it but you don't want it but you're holding on you are still holding on the moment you continue to be like that you can never receive the bir it is so easy to receive the birath by the way the man said es give me the Portage and I'll give you the said will he give me the B he said yes just just exchange what he had was physical but the bir was not physical the B was spiritual the holy spirit is spiritual you know you you give up something you see you give up a physical thing to receive something spiritual that's why es despised it because he felt it is not of value but things of value are not seen with eyes there is something right now now that you are receiving but you are not seeing it with naked eyes but don't you worry the world may despise it the world may despise you even for coming to sit and listen but there is something you are receiving and it is not seen with Naked Eyes there is something spiritual there is a land we are going to it's not seen with physical you have to be in the to see it by eyes of Amen we are walking a walk of what fa this is not money it is more than money this is not you know Prestige is more than houses is more than anything the world can give the word will give you something the world will never be able to give God will give you things that God has already given you my my mind that's why Christians we decide to let go to release the world to leave the world and follow Jesus you can say I've decided to follow Jesus and that's you have to be ready to let go you have to meet God on his requirement and then looked at walking alone after receiving the B but tonight in the next 30 minutes or so I want us to look at a quot in in the Ephesian church about the twins there in Genesis 4 41 brother bam says notice the exact way the the record of God sets forth the account of the births of Cain Abel and S and in Genesis 412 it says and Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bear can and said I have got a man from the Lord and she again bear his brother Abel and then now vers 25 and Adam knew his wife again and she bear a son and called his name now I want you I'm going slow here because I want you to catch it there are three sons born from two acts of can knowledge by Adam how many times how many signs out of it three since the Bible is the exact and perfect word of God this is not mistake but a record of our illumination for our illumination since three sons were born from two acts by Adam you know positively that one of those three was not the son of Adam God has recorded this in the exact manner to show us something the truth of the matter is that had in her womb two sons twins from separate impregnations she was calling twins with K's conception sometime previous to that of ab see those twins again now now don't miss this please we have looked at the scenario of Rea and two sons is and are you following me es and Jacob and Jacob we both seeds from one man Isaac natural seed there's something I want to show you the children of God today are not born from from the natural seed of your father you are born from the spiritual seed of your father you have a [Music] father that one will never give birth to a seed of God but there is also your father spiritual who is God and he also has a seed and that seed is the word that one will always give birth to sons of God so there was K and there was but here we see in the beginning at first they were supposed to be seeds from a natural father are you following me okay I I just hope that you get the revation let's carry on she was now we see you know the woman Eve is carrying twins in of separate impregnations she was calling twins with can's conception sometime meaning she conceived first she conceived Abel and the father of Cain was not the father of Abel the father of was the serent the father of was if you following say perfect type always to those who think that that is not possible because I mean it's like mindboggling how one woman have twins in a womb from two different fathers at the same time is it possible yes let it be known that medical records are rep with cases where women have cared twins who were of separate over and separate insemination with the fertilization of the egg being days apart and not only so but some of the records show that the twins were fed by separate males recently worldwide coverage was given to a Norwegian mother who was suing her husband for support for herself and her [Music] twins one of which was White and the other Twi was black she admitted that she had a negro lover the two conceptions were about three weeks apart hey three weeks apart hband and then a two different children Black and White born at the same time twin black and white two different fathers same mother same wom is it possible yes it happened in America even at the time of brother happened in e happened in Uganda some of you read the news some years ago it has now since happened many many times and medically proven but by the time brother preached this it was medically not yet proven you are looking for vations that is the true prophet of Malachi 4 Elijah the prophet of our this is one of them he told something before even science discovered and when science discovered it only confirmed what God had said oh my God can you imagine it because brother bam say Kan was not a son of Adam he was a TW in the wom ofy the they were noted by the same in the same way I want you to know that is why Eve means mother of all [Music] living but means Son of God and when did Eve become Eve she became Eve after having the twin what does it mean Adam was a father of only the children of God mother the good and the bad all that are living on Earth but Adam did not F that's why when you search your scriptures you will never find in the genealogies of Adam you will never find there and the B says Enoch was the s from Adam and when you count those seven generations Kan is nonexistent yet the lineage of Cain continued contined and so what am I trying to say that Cain has never been a son of Adam C was mothered by Eve and remember Eve is a type of the church a woman according to the scripture she's always the type of the church so she mothered the twins oh praise the name of the Lord and these twins today in the Church of Jesus you know we are supposed to be the wife of Jesus the first wife of Adam had twins but these twins we are from two different father the second Church of Adam the second the church today also has twins but those twins are also from two different father not all those twins are from Jesus they have the name of Jesus they call themselves fathered by Jesus but Jesus rejects them he says I am not your father and what reason does he give he said because you reject my word I cannot be your father and he he looked at them and he said you of your father the devil and they said what we are children of Abraham he said If Abraham was your father you would have listened to me because Abraham listened to me in other words today we have people in the framework of the Christian faith but when they are not truly sons of God when they are not truly the children of God but they call themselves by the name of Christ and they in every Church Ral the womb let's look at the wom little in the message the pain and Jacob I don't care what he is he wants that b he is the spiritual one and them two today is in the womb of the church and ab jaob and in the wom of the church there is a great big system trying to be formed called The World Council of churches and from the womb of the church is coming forth two children he said you just mark my word brother bam talked about the coming of the world C of churches before it came and he said all this Nations will join but only the bride will not that's another Vindication for you and it has formed now and people will join it but the bride will never join the word must deliver the word bride church the church has got to be delivered out of her a bride for Christ them that fell asleep in all ages will make up that bride that come out on the word that they came out on like from your feet coming to your head she gets greater and more you have to have and so forth the body grows up so does the body of Christ grow up and then finally the head will come to it the head of it will now if we know because it's all linked to the head but these systems will not grow out of that because it's a system and it can bring forth a CO cannot bring forth a bunch of wheat but they are both in the same field watered by the same water and the same sunlight one is the word one is not the word and them two are fighting they've been fighting since the first reformation and they are still fighting and even in in the church today those two Spirits are still fighting the spiritual belever and the canot believer the spiritual believer will always be interested in the B the believer is not interested as long as he goes to church he pays his TI he's a good Christian but a spiritual belie will not rest until she has the B the spiritual believer is not out of the systems but she is linked to the Head Christ the word she comes out of the word amen and he says these are very important things a CO cannot bring forth we but they both in the same field we have the same church but this church it has two different crops it has two different seeds but they in the same ground they take the same water they take the same spirit is the same word the atmosphere is the same the one seed one seed cannot bear the word the other one Whatever thing you do no matter what you do it will bear the word there is something I want you to see he says when you have a CO and you have the wheat they in the same field they receiving the same water they receiving the same Sun Even in our churches not all of us are the bride this message listen get two two two seeds them in the church begin to water them by the word the more preachers preach the more some people are becoming great Sinners and you wonder why in the church that's why I tell you never blame any Pastor if he preaching the true word if a pastor is preaching the word and people are becoming worse it is only because there is a problem in the seed area but because if you plant maze and you water it and you give it sunshine because the water has been too much and sunshine has been too much now we are going to get whe is it possible you can only have maze you can only have maze because it is the original City planted you can only Avest the original that you planted the word has been preached for 2000 years generation it has been vesting the original SE when was I planted I was planted before the foundation of the world that's why I believe there are people that are living on Earth to today and the generations before and those to come that can never test hell that can never be lost no matter what the devil does to say no matter what they go through no matter even which SCS they were a part of are you getting my point why because they were the original SE planted by God in the beginning when you power the word out it will just make them recognize who they are amen amen amen amen when you preach the same word and you preach Grace the other seed which is bad will just become worse they will use grace sin but the original sin when they hear Grace they will use Grace to be deliver and to come out of sin amen the problem is in the seed which kind of seed are you which twin are you are you the spiritual one or the the kind one that's why there is no Pastor who can save anyone sometimes I I when I make that statement I make it out of a lot of pain because an experience I am one person I did not know I was like that but I discovered I had a heart for people I believed everyone can be saved I've been you put your hand on someone and I pray for them I will preach to them I will teach them I will instruct them and then eventually the more you do it looks like you driving them to I learned the hard way there are some people who can never be saved no matter what you do so because I learned that I reduced I now decided to S the seed of the word if you are a seed you will when you hear it you will it I don't want to myself if you are not to get saved you never get saved but if you are to get and is a seed of God let me tell you even if you here one service I want come to your home and pleas it is not to be bed it knows what it is it is the word which proves it say Amen that is me the womb is the church which is Christianity many will claim to be that church but watch their life does it align with the word if you don't want it you don't want it and let me tell you if you don't want it don't force yourself go and enjoy the world because you are wasting much time you would have enjoyed the world a lot than being in church and under rules if you take a pig and you you wash it and you clean it and you tell it now baby pig let me even perfume from today you see that M out there never go to [Music] eat and then you lock will be there when it rains it will start singing thiss rules there are too much these laws rules I am locked up here because it a pig when ites mad out I can't wait I just want to go myself they M oh my God they enjoying look at the to enjoy laws the big will always see laws rules but a child of God even listen listen even before you change even before you change moment you get contacted by the word you'll be convicted and you'll be like the prodal I don't belong here how did I get myself into this mess I'm not supposed to be here what happened to me how did I begin to eat with pigs what's wrong with me my heart is yearning for Holiness my heart is for right I want to be like what they want why because you a child of you have always been a child of God there is something in you calling for that righteousness that Holiness listen what makes the difference is not what you do what makes the difference what your desire is it shows you who you are you cannot fake that it is original you you can only have the appetite for who you are so as I'm finishing Matthew 244 says there shall arise forse Christ and false prophets and they shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall receive the very El and the prophet message leadership is say false prophets the Bible say in the last days there would be false prophets Jesus said there shall rise forse Christ not false Jesus now nobody stands still for that but false Christ Christ means the anointed one fely anointed they are anointed but they are FSE at the bottom of and they do good signs and wonders they speak in tongu they dance in the spirit they preach the gospel Judas isar did it I mean prophesied the hypocrite they done all signs everything all the religious moves but you see you put a CO seed and a we SE in the same bed and power the water down upon them and anoint them they will both Rejoice they will both grow by it in the same water The Sun Shines on the just and the unjust and the rain falls on the unjust and the unjust by their fruits you shall know them how can you keep from lining up with the word see what I mean the water falls on the just and the unjust anointed Jesus said they will come to me in that day they say Lord Lord I have not I have not done prophesy done good things in your name he would say you workers of iniquity depart from me I don't even know you go into eternal hell that's been prepared for the devil and his angels you see what a word fely Worship in vain striving in vain why do you do what when you don't have to do it why take a substitute when the heavens is full of the Gen you don't have to do that using let us stop pretending if you have not changed you have not yet changed your desire work on that satisfy your desire whoever you are satisfy your desire of course the flesh is the other twin also will never age with you but your heart in your soul another twin that's the real you I'm talking about that one what do you desire in there the reason why you come to church because you have a desire that's why you said let me go to church even when the flesh your brother says tired you don't need to go to church always you be Church what's wrong with you and you like and then you hear Jacob speak I'm hungry give up that page just go and get a birath right and say I can't wait I can't wait something comes all over you I have to go to church and that's why you are here and that's why you're Turing in on zo and that's why you're here in the word why because you have something calling for that proves my friends that you are a child of God the man of a person that desires the word you can't you can't you know try and pretend even when brother es you scared of him all the time you're trying to run away from him but I tell you this don't fear anymore the moment you get a bir let me tell you what the bir does to you will make you stop fearing es this is when you get the B on the inside you'll begin to stop fearing you will no longer run away you said let me this once and for all fear the flesh they always afraid they even themselves fear themselves ever since I got the ho spirit I stopped fearing myself I stopped fearing what the devil can do because I know there are certain things that devil cannot use me when when when Jacob fought with the angel he said now he was running away you remember from sending gifts to appease him he stopped sending gifts he stopped appeasing the flesh he said let me go f I am more than able to face him if he kills me he kills me if I die I die but let me go first brother when you receive the birth right you will now stand Fearless if I die I die but let me f the flesh let me f the world let me f what the devil is doing if I die I die but one thing I know he that is in me is greater than he that is in hallelujah amen God bless you let us stand up on our feet [Applause] amen don't let Kan kill AB oh my my but I tell you what AB can never be killed if is killed you think AB will again rise up through am what I'm saying the seed of God can never be destroyed I am the seed of God tell your neighbor I am and the Bible say they that are born of God not born of your father of God canot sin I cannot even sin I am above sin brother
