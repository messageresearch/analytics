tells us and grieve not the holy spirit of God let us begin from 20 29 it says that let not not no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying agamante burichima blessed with the name of the Lord this shows us every word we speak every word that comes out of our mouth if it's not edifying we better not speak it out that's why the scripture tells us that when we meet when we come together let the Lord come with some this one with testimony this amen Nina blessed with the name of the Lord because when one comes with sounds another one with the testimony we are edifying one another blessed with the name of the Lord Jesus because God has done this to me the other one comes with a song [Music] [Applause] I have been singing this song

about it preachers have preached about the Holy Spirit until the lady has just used to it but brother let me tell you God is summarizing with a Gentiles in the grace of God is soon going back to the Jews very soon the gentle door will shut and there will be no more Holy Ghost the property the message says that oh that we all know we are living in the laude foreign I do not look for the American
