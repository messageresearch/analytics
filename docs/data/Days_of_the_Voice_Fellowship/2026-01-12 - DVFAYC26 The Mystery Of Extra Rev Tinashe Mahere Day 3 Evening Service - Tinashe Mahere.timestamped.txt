[0:00] Amen.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints.
[0:15] Um the song that I am about to sing is
[0:19] talking about the blood
[0:22] which I believe as we have heard that as
[0:26] long as we have the blood as long as we
[0:28] have the token upon us Satan has nothing
[0:31] over us. That is what I believe and that
[0:34] is my testimony and my confession today
[0:38] because
[0:40] many will be our afflictions but we
[0:43] believe that he will deliver us
[0:46] whenever
[0:50] your spirit is low.
[0:54] Just remember the blood
[0:58] &gt;&gt; that speaks for you.
[1:05] Please brother, put it on the screen.
[1:08] You can't cross the bloodline.
[1:14] So that you may look at the lyrics
[1:18] and may the song go deep in your heart
[1:20] as it has gone to me.
[1:35] Even though my spirit's low
[1:39] and it seems
[1:43] but still
[1:46] I see
[1:48] victory
[1:52] many times. times I'm walking by faith.
[1:56] Can see what lies before me, but still
[2:02] I see
[2:04] victory.
[2:08] And I just got to tell you, Satan,
[2:13] you can't cross the bloodline
[2:18] because I'm covered by his blood.
[2:25] And you may stare and you may fight, but
[2:29] you're going to lose this battle
[2:32] tonight. Cuz remember,
[2:36] you can't cross the bloodline.
[2:42] Sometimes our battles get hot and it
[2:47] seems we fighting a lot. Oh, I remember
[2:53] I'm standing on the rock.
[2:58] So, Satan, if I were you, I'd turn
[3:03] around and give up to cause. I do
[3:08] believe
[3:09] you're bound to lose.
[3:13] Oh,
[3:15] and I just got to tell you, Satan,
[3:20] you can't cross the bloodline
[3:24] because I'm covered by his.
[3:31] Oh, and you may stare and you may fight,
[3:36] but you're going to lose this battle
[3:39] tonight. So remember,
[3:42] you can't cross the bloodline.
[3:49] I've been sealed by predestination,
[3:53] by the lamb's great revelation
[3:57] chosen before
[4:00] the world began.
[4:05] So devil, don't try to shake me. For the
[4:10] word that lives inside me is the same
[4:16] that conquered death and hell.
[4:22] And I just got to tell you, Satan,
[4:26] you can't cross the bloodline
[4:31] because I'm covered by his blood.
[4:38] And you may stare and you may fight, but
[4:42] you're going to lose this battle
[4:45] tonight. goes remember
[4:49] you can't cross the bloodline
[4:55] I remind you anient serpent
[4:59] this word made flesh and present and the
[5:04] blood
[5:05] still speaks for me.
[5:11] You may roar and bring your treasure,
[5:15] but the token is my shelter.
[5:20] And you'll never cross the blood, you
[5:23] see.
[5:26] Oh,
[5:28] and I just got to tell you, Satan,
[5:32] you can't cross the bloodline
[5:37] because I'm covered by his blood.
[5:44] And you may stare and you may fight, but
[5:48] you're going to lose this battle
[5:51] tonight. Cuz remember,
[5:55] you can't cross the bloodline.
[6:00] Oh, and I just got to tell you, Satan,
[6:05] you can't cross the bloodline
[6:09] because I'm covered by his blood.
[6:16] And you may stare and you may fight, but
[6:20] you're going to lose this battle
[6:23] tonight. Go. Remember,
[6:27] you can't cross the bloodline.
[6:32] Oh, you may stir and you may fight, but
[6:37] you're going to lose this battle
[6:39] tonight. Cuz remember,
[6:43] you can't cross the bloodline.

[36:40] Goliath is dead.
[36:43] So we need to have pastor Maher come AND
[36:46] CUT OFF THE
[36:52] BUT BEFORE THAT HAPPENS,
[36:56] brother Isaac should prepare
[37:01] for that event.
[37:05] How many agree to that?
[37:08] Listen,
[37:10] brother Isaac was our first come
[37:12] speaker.
[37:15] And I said, I've seen him preach before.
[37:19] I always thought
[37:21] he has not given us his best
[37:25] I still believe the same.
[37:28] So but meanwhile I just want him to come
[37:30] and greet us
[37:32] and maybe you know a word or two
[37:36] and then we will take it up from there.
[37:41] God bless you man of God.
[37:53] Praise the Lord.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; I say praise the Lord.
[38:00] I say hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[38:04] Are we happy to be young people?
[38:08] Touch on somebody. Tell him I'm happy to
[38:10] be. ARE YOU
[38:16] AMEN.
[38:18] AMEN. Touch another one. Tell him I'm
[38:20] happy to be a young person.
[38:26] Amen. Amen.
[38:31] This is my greeting to the camp
[38:35] and the Nairobi team. I want to know I
[38:37] appreciate you for coming.
[38:41] Um I would have been very lonesome if I
[38:45] came alone
[38:49] &gt;&gt; and I request that the support we have
[38:51] given pastor TMO from DVF camp
[38:55] first to fourth we continue that way
[39:03] but because of of the constant of time I
[39:05] want to just greet with a scripture
[39:09] that is in proverbs chapter 29
[39:13] chapter 20 and verse 29
[39:18] we can read while seated so that I don't
[39:20] get
[39:23] that is proverbs chapter
[39:26] 20 and verse 29 only
[39:32] and I think the brothers that came from
[39:33] Nairobi who are not necessarily young
[39:35] people
[39:38] they and bear me witness. I told them
[39:40] our DVF meetings are not all only about
[39:43] youth.
[39:48] Is that true?
[39:51] It's I told them our DF meetings is like
[39:54] a convention for everyone.
[39:58] So be sure if you call for another one
[40:00] on time, we
[40:04] proverbs chapter 20 verse 29.
[40:08] Are we there?
[40:10] &gt;&gt; The glory of young men is their strength
[40:14] and the beauty of the old man is the
[40:17] gray head.
[40:26] Can we read together
[40:28] one to go?
[40:30] The glory of the young men is their
[40:34] strength and the beauty of old men is
[40:39] the gray hair. Hallelujah.
[40:48] So,
[40:50] so I see in Nairobi
[40:54] old men
[40:56] and old women
[40:59] when they develop gray hair,
[41:01] they try to paint it black
[41:05] because they want to remain young.
[41:09] And this is an inspiration
[41:13] because WHERE WE ARE GOING
[41:15] THERE WILL BE NO GRAY HAIR
[41:18] BECAUSE WE SHALL BE 19.
[41:21] COME ON SOMEBODY SAY PRAISE THE LORD
[41:24] WHERE WE ARE GOING THERE WILL BE NO OLD
[41:27] MEN.
[41:29] WE WE ARE PREPARING OURSELVES
[41:32] FOR A YOUTH CAMP
[41:36] and and old MEN ARE NOT INVITED.
[41:41] SO MAY THE OLD MAN
[41:44] START turning young.
[41:48] If you FEEL OLD
[41:51] EXERCISE
[41:54] TO BE YOUNG
[41:56] BECAUSE WE ARE GOING

[47:34] That's right.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; But we SHALL WIN THE WORLD
[47:38] WHEN THIS WORD
[47:40] BECOMES FLESH.
[47:43] HALLELUJAH.

[49:10] THE POWER
[49:12] to become what God wanted you TO
[49:17] is not WITH PASTOR MAH
[49:19] AND NOT WITH BROTHER ISA
[49:22] AND NOT WITH PASTOR
[49:24] MICHAEL. THE POWER IS WITHIN YOU.
[49:32] THEY DIDN'T GET THAT.
[49:34] THE POWER TO become what GOD WANTS YOU
[49:37] TO BE.
[49:39] IS NOT WITHIN THE PREACHER.
[49:44] What we do as MINISTRY
[49:50] to bring THE

[50:00] Hallelujah.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; OH HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. SO THE BIBLE
[50:06] MUST BECOME FLESH.
[50:09] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR
[50:11] MUST WALK IN
[50:14] WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU
[50:17] THAT IS MY
[50:25] GLORY.

[51:11] pit.
[51:18] GLORY.
[51:23] Praise the Lord.

[51:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Isaac.
[51:34] That was tremendous.
[51:37] Amen. You know what? We are not part of
[51:40] any camp.
[51:43] When you are you are about to think
[51:46] that we are of the WORD GROUP.
[51:50] THEN YOU will find out. We are also the
[51:52] Holy Ghost group.
[51:55] When you when you thinking we are ONLY
[51:57] OF THE WORD, THEN YOU BEGIN TO FIND OUT
[52:00] we are also BELIEVING THE THUNDER.
[52:04] SO THEN THEN YOU GET CONFUSED.
[52:06] THE REASON IS ALL THESE THINGS ARE IN
[52:09] THE MESSAGE
[52:12] AND WHEN YOU ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN THINKING
[52:15] THAT IS ONLY this you know teachings
[52:17] that we believe
[52:19] then you begin to realize we are
[52:21] different CLASS OF PEOPLE.
[52:24] WE are here to manifest the life of the
[52:27] message.
[52:30] BY THE WAY, THE MESSAGE, THE PURPOSE OF
[52:33] THE MESSAGE
[52:34] THAT WE MIGHT BECOME,
[52:38] not that we might believe,
[52:42] we might become.

[52:47] I'VE just been preaching that. I hope
[52:50] you'll carry it with you TO

[53:09] &gt;&gt; This is for you, Pastor Maher,
[53:12] &gt;&gt; because you're just going to take the
[53:13] platform short.

[53:18] There's a sister called Jamaima.
[53:21] She requests prayer for her auntie.
[53:24] She's suffering from breast cancer.
[53:27] They have tried every doctor, every
[53:29] hospital, but the sickness could not. I
[53:32] trust in the Lord that he can set her
[53:34] free
[53:35] because he's the Lord that he heals all
[53:37] manner of diseases.
[53:40] There is nothing to hurt.
[53:42] Amen.
[53:44] Could you pass it on to him?

[55:37] difficult to please

[55:59] and for fear of forgetting anybody
[56:02] I'm not going to mention names
[56:04] uh you know those who have been doing
[56:06] the music
[56:08] we have a lot of brothers and sisters
[56:11] and sisters singing all of you God bless
[56:13] you
[56:15] if you appreciate whatever they have
[56:16] done it's
[56:20] there are those that have been doing the
[56:22] logistics
[56:26] moving and
[56:28] especially the two brothers.
[56:31] I'll set true to my commitment. I will

[56:37] will forget some names but I appreciate
[56:40] you those and God sees your

[56:50] you know and to make sure that you know
[56:52] everything they're comfortable and
[56:55] and of course there are also those who
[56:57] uh gave us cars
[57:01] uh you know parents of the young people
[57:04] in our church some of them are here I
[57:08] think um I saw brother wonder where is
[57:11] he
[57:14] outside.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Okay, that's the because he's not part
[57:18] of your group. That's why I was
[57:18] mentioning him.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; And his wife, is she here?
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Okay. Is he the one? No.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; No. Okay. So, well, tell him I
[57:32] appreciate him. I know he's out. We
[57:35] appreciate him. Let us give him a clap.
[57:38] And uh also, Pastor and Mrs.
[57:42] We appreciate
[57:45] these two gave us cars
[57:47] and I know there are other brothers who
[57:48] have been using you know their own cars.
[57:52] We appreciate all
[57:54] the media team.
[57:57] We appreciate you. They had issues with
[58:00] the internet
[58:02] in the beginning but I think it is now
[58:04] sorted. We appreciate you very much.
[58:08] reception team.
[58:11] They told me they had some issues with
[58:13] some brethren.
[58:15] People are coming and say we still pay
[58:18] fee
[58:21] and the brother told me I I almost
[58:23] became angry.
[58:25] But I humbled myself
[58:28] and I told myself
[58:30] explain to the brother I don't know
[58:32] whether it was a sister
[58:34] &gt;&gt; but you know why? because to him it was
[58:36] a shock that this person did not know
[58:38] that he's supposed to support where he
[58:42] is coming for a camp.
[58:49] I hope there is going to come a time
[58:52] when all you young people will
[58:54] appreciate that fact
[58:57] that uh you have to support the work of
[58:59] God.
[59:02] Don't never want anything for free.
[59:05] The word is not for free,
[59:08] but you receive it freely.
[59:12] When you eat food,
[59:14] it's going to be bought.
[59:17] This place is rented. It's not
[59:20] the accommodations you sleep at are
[59:21] paid.
[59:23] So, if you don't want to contribute,
[59:26] who will pay that?
[59:28] So we have to be co-workers
[59:31] in the body.
[59:33] Amen. Uh the interpreters
[59:37] some of them their voices died.
[59:41] I thought I have a very good
[59:42] interpreter.
[59:45] Pastor Maher just busted his voice.
[59:50] But we appreciate all the interpreters
[59:54] the deacons and the ashers. God bless
[59:57] you. Uh the medical team, we have some
[59:59] doctors but
[1:00:01] I'll not mention names the brother and
[1:00:03] the nurses
[1:00:06] those who have been working in the
[1:00:07] sanitation
[1:00:09] technical and
[1:00:11] also taking care of the visitors in
[1:00:13] terms of food.
[1:00:15] Let us give these brothers and sisters.
[1:00:21] Amen. Now the team that put up all this,
[1:00:26] this was designed by a brother in our
[1:00:27] church.
[1:00:31] It's not from outside
[1:00:33] and it was printed by a brother in our
[1:00:35] church.
[1:00:37] We appreciate all the the
[1:00:41] God bless you.
[1:00:43] And now allow me that uh we will now go
[1:00:47] for the last for the last lap.
[1:00:54] Are we ready for it?
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; You know
[1:00:59] when pastor Maher is preaching,
[1:01:04] it is okay for you.
[1:01:07] But for those of us preachers,
[1:01:10] you start wondering,
[1:01:12] am I a preacher?
[1:01:16] What am I going to preach at?
[1:01:20] you know, he's a the preaching machine.
[1:01:26] And you know, what one thing I love
[1:01:28] about his ministry
[1:01:30] is that he's deep ON THE WORD.
[1:01:34] HE doesn't go on the surface.
[1:01:36] He's deep on the word and uh we we
[1:01:39] appreciate the gift of God in you
[1:01:42] and uh pray that uh as we close these
[1:01:45] meetings,
[1:01:47] you will receive your last portion.
[1:01:50] after this service we are going to go uh
[1:01:54] we we will try to see if the Dick Gideon
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; let me also join me to appreciate this
[1:02:00] young man
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; very wonderful young man he works for
[1:02:07] this facility
[1:02:10] but he's pretty much been part of us
[1:02:12] through the meetings
[1:02:14] and I've seen him enjoying everyone
[1:02:17] and so he will be together with our team
[1:02:19] setting
[1:02:21] at the at the at the campfire.
[1:02:24] What we're going to do there is
[1:02:26] testimonies. If you have something God
[1:02:29] has done for you, come share it. Um if
[1:02:32] you have a song you do not sing,
[1:02:35] you know, fellowship, that's what we
[1:02:38] going to do. We'll do it until we are
[1:02:40] tired.
[1:02:42] You go sleep and then in the morning we
[1:02:46] will have a little breakfast for those
[1:02:47] who are coming.
[1:02:49] so that we can dismiss you. So the Lord
[1:02:52] bless you. Sister Joel, the floor is
[1:02:56] yours. As the pastor prepares to come,
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Pastor Maher,
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; please come again.
[1:03:06] How many want him to come again?
[1:03:08] Amen.
[1:03:10] This was just a little tour.

[1:03:18] I hope you can go back and tell them the
[1:03:21] land is
[1:03:23] flow with milk and honey.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; God bless you, sister Joe.
[1:03:55] God
[1:03:57] saw himself in flesh
[1:04:02] even before creation.
[1:04:07] His purpose was redemption.
[1:04:12] God
[1:04:13] always saw himself in flesh.
[1:04:19] Even before creation,
[1:04:24] the lamb was lame before the foundation
[1:04:28] of the world.
[1:04:33] as Elohim.
[1:04:35] He thought it all. Mechis
[1:04:39] created the world but in Jesus
[1:04:44] he expressed it love to us.
[1:04:50] Oh, I follow him. He thoughts it all. Me
[1:04:56] created the world. But in Jesus,
[1:05:01] he expressed love to us.
[1:05:08] We're on a journey
[1:05:11] that started in the mind of God
[1:05:15] and we land in a glorified body. Keep on
[1:05:20] descending so we can ascend.

[1:06:08] even before creation
[1:06:13] to be expressed in another body before
[1:06:18] redemption.
[1:06:22] And now the word herself takes the word
[1:06:25] itself and reveals the self in itself.
[1:06:30] quickening the scriptures
[1:06:33] that's been written about her.
[1:06:39] In other word herself, it's the word

[1:08:36] weakening the scriptures
[1:08:40] that's been written about her.

[1:10:16] itself and reveals herself in itself.
[1:10:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:39] That sister is the jewel.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Let's put our hands together.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; You see
[1:10:53] when they are coming to South Africa,
[1:10:58] she might not go back to Kenya.
[1:11:04] She is too good a singer.
[1:11:14] I don't tell the young men in my church
[1:11:17] who to marry and who not to marry.
[1:11:22] But on this one,
[1:11:25] I will have to break my oath.
[1:11:31] She is just a gift.
[1:11:35] God bless you.
[1:11:36] Amen.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; I was a little disappointed.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; The bass was too loud.
[1:11:47] You know, you know, even in Benoni, we
[1:11:49] struggle with bass players
[1:11:55] and sometimes the bass drowns the voice.
[1:12:01] I'm a music person myself.
[1:12:05] So you must always balance the sound to
[1:12:09] the voice
[1:12:14] so we don't lose the message in
[1:12:16] entertainment.
[1:12:22] But we forgot to acknowledge our
[1:12:24] musicians.
[1:12:26] Let's put our hands together for them.
[1:12:33] I would like to give special
[1:12:34] acknowledgement to the sister
[1:12:38] who was playing bass in previous
[1:12:40] services.
[1:12:44] In the past two services I heard you
[1:12:47] playing leadh
[1:12:52] where is that sister city?
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; She she she plays
[1:13:02] Oh, is it? Yeah, I saw she switched.
[1:13:06] She is really gifted
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; and we appreciate God for her.
[1:13:13] Uh
[1:13:15] it's been an absolute pleasure to be
[1:13:17] here.
[1:13:20] I have thoroughly enjoyed myself.
[1:13:24] I would like to appreciate
[1:13:29] for the invitation,
[1:13:31] for the confidence
[1:13:34] and for arranging such a successful
[1:13:36] youth meeting.
[1:13:41] I see that uh the people are even more
[1:13:43] and more coming.
[1:13:47] I'm sure if there was tomorrow again,
[1:13:51] the place will be more packed than it
[1:13:53] is.
[1:13:55] It shows that uh God is honoring the
[1:13:58] vision by vindicating it.
[1:14:04] May you be blessed with your family,
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; with your children,
[1:14:09] with your ministry.
[1:14:11] He He was a blessing when he came to
[1:14:13] South Africa.
[1:14:16] There's a reason why God opens doors for
[1:14:19] a man.
[1:14:23] It is because the favor of God is upon
[1:14:25] his life.
[1:14:28] And when you have such a man in your
[1:14:30] midst,
[1:14:33] don't try to stand in his way.
[1:14:36] If you are opposed to him, stand aside.
[1:14:40] But you would do better if you put your
[1:14:42] shoulders together with him.
[1:14:46] Brother Brham says, "Don't mock the man
[1:14:48] with don't try to tackle the man with
[1:14:50] the ball."
[1:14:55] If you're playing for the same team,
[1:14:58] support the man with the ball
[1:15:01] and God bless you. You might be the
[1:15:04] youngest pastor in Kala,
[1:15:08] but your heart is in the right place.
[1:15:12] Amen.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:14] We wouldn't have come if he was a
[1:15:17] scandalous man.
[1:15:22] But we also have a bit of discernment
[1:15:24] about us
[1:15:28] to know a man that is standing for the
[1:15:30] right.
[1:15:34] God bless you. Thank you for connecting
[1:15:36] me to a lot of friends
[1:15:40] here in Uganda.
[1:15:42] Ugandan friends
[1:15:45] and friends from Ethiopia,
[1:15:48] friends from Australia,
[1:15:50] Australia, Ethiopia, all because of
[1:15:52] brother Bas.
[1:15:55] We appreciate God so much.
[1:15:59] And uh you know when he preached in in
[1:16:01] Perth,
[1:16:04] he he called me
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; to ask me do you know a pastor called
[1:16:10] Pastor Michael?
[1:16:14] I said from where? I already knew where
[1:16:16] he's going.
[1:16:19] He says from Australia.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; I said what about him?
[1:16:26] He says he's just like you.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; I said you are not the first person to
[1:16:31] say that.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; No, he was 20 years late.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; That call was 20 years late
[1:16:41] and we appreciate God
[1:16:44] and uh appreciate uh you know pastor
[1:16:47] Michael's ministration in the morning.
[1:16:52] Amen. That was sobering.
[1:16:57] Uh you see you need that
[1:17:00] when you have a meeting.
[1:17:03] You must have every aspect of our
[1:17:05] Christian life addressed.
[1:17:10] Introspection is one of those things.
[1:17:16] He was showing us how to get to perfect
[1:17:18] realization.
[1:17:22] The pathway to purpose.
[1:17:26] How you have to know yourself
[1:17:30] that even by knowing yourself,
[1:17:33] death becomes a pleasure.
[1:17:38] Amen.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; That when Christ knew his purpose,
[1:17:45] death became a pleasure.
[1:17:48] The Bible says,
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; and brother Josh came and picked it up
[1:17:54] in Matthew 17,
[1:17:57] the adoption of Christ
[1:18:00] in on Matthew in in John chapter 4,
[1:18:04] in John chapter one actually
[1:18:06] when he's baptized,
[1:18:09] it's actually his birth,
[1:18:12] he receives the Holy Ghost. The lamp is
[1:18:15] being washed.
[1:18:18] And he just say this is my beloved son
[1:18:20] in whom I'm pleased to dwell in
[1:18:26] full stop. And brother Brennham says
[1:18:28] your birth is not your adoption.
[1:18:35] The new birth is the earnest.
[1:18:40] In other words, it's the down payment.
[1:18:44] But when he comes to Matthew 17,
[1:18:47] He is moving into the full stature
[1:18:52] of the ministry of who he was
[1:18:55] because remember there was the man part
[1:18:57] and the God part.
[1:19:01] So the man part had to go through
[1:19:03] everything that you and me go through.
[1:19:08] He says he learned obedience
[1:19:12] through the things that he suffered.
[1:19:16] So he was suffering even through his
[1:19:18] life growing up
[1:19:20] to come to Matthew 17
[1:19:24] where he is no longer saying I'm pleased
[1:19:25] to dwell in him
[1:19:31] but there was a voice transfer
[1:19:34] to say ye him.
[1:19:40] And the Bible says from that time,
[1:19:44] he began TO SPEAK ABOUT HOW THE son of
[1:19:47] man must suffer
[1:19:51] and how he's supposed to be killed,
[1:19:55] which was the purpose of his coming.
[1:19:59] It was to die on the cross,
[1:20:02] but he could not preach it
[1:20:05] until he comes to the maturity.
[1:20:08] So maturity
[1:20:10] is understanding
[1:20:12] that suffering is part of the package.
[1:20:19] That's why Paul would be told if you go
[1:20:21] to Jerusalem you will die.
[1:20:25] The prophecy by Agabas
[1:20:30] but he says to leave is Christ
[1:20:34] is to die IS GAIN
[1:20:36] RUN THE RACE.
[1:20:39] I FINISHED MY COURSE AND THEY AWAIT ME A
[1:20:42] CLOUD
[1:20:44] AND reward for the life I HAVE LIVED.
[1:20:49] IF HE SLAYS ME,
[1:20:52] I'LL still praise him. That level of
[1:20:55] maturity
[1:20:58] comes with the correct teaching.
[1:21:02] That's what pastor Michael was talking
[1:21:03] about.
[1:21:05] The reason why
[1:21:08] sometimes we have got the lake of the
[1:21:10] new birth
[1:21:14] says it is because of wrong teaching.
[1:21:19] Your teaching about the matter is wrong.
[1:21:25] That's why you also have an airship of
[1:21:27] ministers that fall along the way.
[1:21:32] It's because of the lack of the new
[1:21:34] birth.
[1:21:36] And the lack of the new birth
[1:21:39] is also because of the lack of correct
[1:21:41] teeth.
[1:21:44] Because when you are born, you are a
[1:21:46] baby.
[1:21:50] If you preach the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:52] Ghost as if it's the climax,
[1:21:56] you
[1:21:59] will end up into Nikolitism
[1:22:03] where you as the pastor
[1:22:06] will want to do the work of the Holy
[1:22:09] Ghost
[1:22:11] because you'll be disappointed with the
[1:22:13] PEOPLE
[1:22:16] not knowing that WHEN THEY ARE BORN THEY
[1:22:18] ARE BABIES.
[1:22:22] AND THEY ARE UNDER TTORS AND GOVERNORS
[1:22:25] UNTIL
[1:22:29] brother Brandham says you see that boy
[1:22:33] he DIDN'T GET FAR
[1:22:35] BECAUSE HE DIDN'T grow in the Holy
[1:22:37] Ghost.
[1:22:40] So with the HOLY GHOST
[1:22:42] YOU STILL STUMBLE. You still fall.
[1:22:47] WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST, YOU STUMBLE AND
[1:22:50] YOU FALL.
[1:22:52] BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THE HOLY GHOST
[1:22:56] BRINGS YOU UP every time.
[1:23:03] IT CHECKS YOUR LIFE.
[1:23:05] IT TEACHES YOU. THE REASON WHY IT'S A
[1:23:08] TEACHER
[1:23:10] IS BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING.
[1:23:13] FOR RECEIVING THE HOLY GHOST
[1:23:16] DOES NOT MAKE YOU AN ELDER
[1:23:19] MAKES YOU A BABY.
[1:23:21] AMEN.
[1:23:23] We are not preaching it.
[1:23:29] So that was pastor Michael. Thank you
[1:23:31] Michael.
[1:23:34] MY FRIEND
[1:23:35] HE WAS CHARGING ME THERE WHILE I'M
[1:23:37] SITTING THERE.
[1:23:40] We appreciate God.
[1:23:43] We appreciate God,
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; brother Josh.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; If ever you stole my heart,
[1:23:53] this afternoon
[1:23:56] I was sitting there,
[1:23:58] you stole my heart.
[1:24:02] You know you have preached well.
[1:24:05] When a pastor forgets about the people
[1:24:07] that are being preached to
[1:24:11] and he starts thinking about his church
[1:24:13] back home,
[1:24:15] he say, "I wish the people in Benoni
[1:24:21] can hear what this man is preaching."
[1:24:26] That's a message up my street.
[1:24:31] 100% the word.
[1:24:35] You were in your elements.
[1:24:39] And I can tell you, brother Josh,
[1:24:42] say this is your first trip to Africa.
[1:24:46] There's going to be many trips like
[1:24:47] this.
[1:24:50] I'm telling you, brother Josh.
[1:24:53] It is unlimited what God can do with a
[1:24:55] man.
[1:24:57] He can surrender himself
[1:25:00] the way you have surrendered.
[1:25:03] No man is able to put things together
[1:25:05] the way you did.
[1:25:08] Bless God be with you.
[1:25:10] God bless you. Bless your family.
[1:25:15] We really appreciate God.
[1:25:18] Amen.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; My friend, brother,
[1:25:23] he wanted to take over.
[1:25:27] I've never seen such a small man with
[1:25:29] such energy.
[1:25:33] I preached, pastor Michael preached,
[1:25:37] BIG BROTHER JOSH PREACHED.
[1:25:40] Platform never vibrated LIKE
[1:25:53] AND EVEN THE ATMOSPHERE WAS VIBRATING.
[1:25:59] There's no demon here now.
[1:26:05] I'm telling you, THERE'S NO DEMON. IF
[1:26:09] THE DEMON OF SLEEPING
[1:26:12] IS NOT HERE,
[1:26:14] IF YOU THINK I'M LYING, try to sleep
[1:26:16] right now and see.
[1:26:19] TRY IT. TRY IT RIGHT NOW. SLEEPING AND
[1:26:21] SEE
[1:26:28] OUT.
[1:26:30] SICKNESS HAVE BEEN CAST OUT.
[1:26:33] BIG THING HAS BEEN PASSED.
[1:26:37] HALLELUJAH. I have enjoyed being here
[1:26:41] and we really appreciate God.
[1:26:44] Appreciate all of you for all you have
[1:26:45] done.
[1:26:48] Taking us from the airport
[1:26:52] feeding us up until this hour.
[1:26:56] Everything you have done, we appreciate
[1:26:58] it with my fellow ministers here at the
[1:27:03] bottom of our hearts.
[1:27:05] We appreciate you.
[1:27:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you so
[1:27:10] much.
[1:27:12] I think I want to reiterate
[1:27:17] where where is sister shalom
[1:27:21] and sister Mary
[1:27:24] are they here?
[1:27:27] Sister Shalom and Sister Mary. They're
[1:27:29] not here.
[1:27:31] Okay, they will get it on the stream.
[1:27:35] These sisters have been special.
[1:27:39] The the reason why they are not here
[1:27:41] most probably
[1:27:44] they're busy preparing what we are going
[1:27:46] to eat
[1:27:49] and they have been serving us so well
[1:27:53] and very persuasive.
[1:27:57] Do you know that persuasion is a gift?
[1:28:02] Uh one day I'll preach a message called
[1:28:05] the power of persuasion.
[1:28:08] You see, if you look at Paul,
[1:28:11] he speaks like an apostle, a chief
[1:28:14] apostle.
[1:28:17] And you you you you need a certain
[1:28:19] temperament to speak in that tone.
[1:28:25] It's direct.
[1:28:28] It's deep.
[1:28:30] It's bold.
[1:28:32] It's fearless
[1:28:34] when you are in that position.
[1:28:36] And he he says I boast in the profession
[1:28:38] of my calling.
[1:28:41] He says I'm here not for the fellowship
[1:28:43] of flesh and blood
[1:28:46] fellowship of the mystery.
[1:28:49] He says I went to a certain place.
[1:28:52] I met some brothers who had received the
[1:28:54] faith before me.
[1:28:57] I with them for 14 days.
[1:29:00] I thought I would learn something from
[1:29:02] them
[1:29:04] but I learned nothing.
[1:29:06] and I shook their hands
[1:29:10] and I departed from that place.
[1:29:13] THAT is Paul
[1:29:15] SPEAKING IN THE BOLDNESS of his
[1:29:18] ministry.
[1:29:20] But when he was in prison,
[1:29:22] there was a man that he was imprisoned
[1:29:24] with.
[1:29:26] His name was called Onismas
[1:29:30] and he started fellowshipping with
[1:29:31] Onismas
[1:29:33] and converted Onismas.
[1:29:36] But Onismas was in prison
[1:29:39] because he had stolen from a brother
[1:29:41] from Jesus.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; And the brother he had stolen from was
[1:29:46] called Filimon.
[1:29:49] AND THEN PAUL WRITES TO FILIMON
[1:29:53] AND HE DOESN'T WRITE AS PAUL an apostle.
[1:30:00] HE CHANGES HIS TONE.
[1:30:03] HE SAYS, "PAUL,
[1:30:07] I write as Paul the aged."
[1:30:12] HE'S NO LONGER WRITING AS PAUL THE FIRE
[1:30:14] BRAND.
[1:30:17] I REBUKE OF SAYING BEFORE I ARRIVED IN
[1:30:19] CORINTH, I HAVE ALREADY JUDGED THE
[1:30:21] MATTER AND I'M TELLING YOU, I DON'T WANT
[1:30:23] TO FIND THAT BROTHER THERE. SUCH A ONE
[1:30:26] MUST BE PUT IN THE HANDS OF THE KING.
[1:30:34] THE LANGUAGE CHANGES.
[1:30:36] HE IS writing persuading filimony
[1:30:41] TO SAY I THOUGHT I WAS SAVING A SENTENCE
[1:30:48] BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
[1:30:50] THAT THIS WAS A CAUSE AND OCCASION for
[1:30:52] the bringing in of Jesus.
[1:30:58] My brother, he has ruined you,
[1:31:03] BUT LAY NOT HIS CHARGE UPON HIMSELF.
[1:31:08] BUT IF EVER I MEANT ANYTHING TO YOU,
[1:31:12] PUT THE CREDIT IN MY BANK ACCOUNT
[1:31:17] AND RECEIVE SUCH A ONE AS A BROTHER, NOT
[1:31:19] A CHRISTIAN
[1:31:24] of persuasion.
[1:31:27] These sisters were coming with all sorts
[1:31:29] of Ugandan food.
[1:31:34] The way they persuaded us to eat.
[1:31:39] I was on a video call with my wife just
[1:31:41] now.
[1:31:44] She said, "You have gained weight.
[1:31:48] I tried to put a the phone at an angle
[1:31:51] to try to make myself slim.
[1:31:58] She said that angle is not helping
[1:32:03] our sisters.
[1:32:07] Amen. Amen. Let us stand up on our feet.
[1:32:13] And uh
[1:32:15] we appreciate
[1:32:18] yesterday. He was now preaching
[1:32:22] but it was all for a good cause.
[1:32:26] And I believe God will give us a good
[1:32:27] time today.
[1:32:30] Everything has been done.
[1:32:33] Everything has been preached.
[1:32:35] So I'm just going to preach a little
[1:32:36] extra.
[1:32:38] You know, when we talk about extra,
[1:32:41] it means we're finished already.
[1:32:44] So my title is the mystery of extra.
[1:32:51] We just doing the little extra.
[1:32:54] Genesis.
[1:32:57] Uh Genesis is my favorite book.
[1:33:02] My second favorite is the book of
[1:33:04] Revelation.
[1:33:07] And when Pastor Michael kept going into
[1:33:10] the book of Luke
[1:33:14] of the Gospels, I love Luke so much.
[1:33:18] You know, Luke was different
[1:33:21] because Luke never walked with Jesus.
[1:33:26] I know when when people are told to name
[1:33:27] the 12 disciples, they include Luke
[1:33:29] there.
[1:33:34] If ever we have an examined, you put
[1:33:35] Luke, I'll give you a zero.
[1:33:41] Luke was a convert of Paul,
[1:33:46] not a Jew.
[1:33:48] He was a Samaritan.
[1:33:50] His perspective of Jesus
[1:33:54] of all of them.
[1:33:58] He looked at Jesus
[1:34:01] as a different man.
[1:34:04] He had the men anointing.
[1:34:07] He was a gentile like you and me.
[1:34:11] Okay, let me not talk about that. We'll
[1:34:13] talk about it some other time.
[1:34:15] When I come back to Ukraine,
[1:34:20] No, I really love this place. I enjoy
[1:34:22] it.
[1:34:24] But uh let me not promise. You see, if
[1:34:27] you want to be loved, you must discuss.
[1:34:33] If you are too available,
[1:34:36] even in a relationship,
[1:34:39] too much availability
[1:34:42] breathes contempt.
[1:34:48] Sisters, are you CATCHING THE MYSTERY?
[1:34:51] WHEN YOU ARE AVAILABLE for everything,
[1:34:56] appear and disappear,
[1:35:00] you will be lovable.
[1:35:03] Genesis 24 1
[1:35:08] and Abraham was old and well stricken in
[1:35:11] age.
[1:35:13] Sorry.
[1:35:18] Sorry.
[1:35:34] When Abraham was old and well stricken
[1:35:36] in age, and the Lord had blessed him in
[1:35:38] all things. Verse verses one.
[1:35:47] And Abraham said unto his elder servants
[1:35:50] of his house that ruled over all that he
[1:35:52] had, put I pray thee, thy hand under my
[1:35:55] thigh.
[1:36:09] And I will make this whereby the Lord,
[1:36:12] the God of heaven, and the God of earth,
[1:36:14] that thou shalt not take a wife unto my
[1:36:18] son of the daughters of the Canaanites
[1:36:20] among whom I dwell.
[1:36:38] Let's bow our heads. Father, we thank
[1:36:40] you. We've read what we believe to be
[1:36:42] your scripture.
[1:36:46] Anointed that it may be spiritfilled
[1:36:47] spoken words.
[1:36:51] Hide me in the shadow of the cross.
[1:36:54] Make me narrow in the wisdom of men.
[1:37:00] Let Christ and him alone be the one
[1:37:02] projected.
[1:37:05] In Jesus mighty name.
[1:37:08] Amen. And amen. And you may be seated.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; I wanted to say
[1:37:13] anytime these two brothers are invited,
[1:37:19] if you want me to be a third speaker,
[1:37:22] I agree.
[1:37:24] Uh it's it's not everyone you can share
[1:37:29] a convention and it goes well.
[1:37:35] It takes men of kindred spirit
[1:37:41] and I've been honored to share the
[1:37:43] convention.
[1:37:47] Amen.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:52] Let's go to verses six of the same
[1:37:54] chapter.
[1:37:59] I didn't want to read everything while
[1:38:00] you are standing.
[1:38:04] And Abraham said unto him,
[1:38:07] "Beware that thou bring not my son
[1:38:11] fither again.
[1:38:22] Uh, it said that again
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; again for the second time.
[1:38:35] And the Lord God of heaven, which took
[1:38:37] me from my father's house, and from the
[1:38:40] land of my kindred, and which spake unto
[1:38:43] me, and swear unto me, saying, Unto thy
[1:38:46] seed will I give this land, he shall
[1:38:49] send his angel before thee, and thou
[1:38:51] shalt take a wife unto my son from then.
[1:38:54] Amen.
[1:39:16] And if the woman will not be willing to
[1:39:18] follow thee, then thou shalt be clear
[1:39:22] from this my oath.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; We're back to the statement again. Only
[1:39:26] bring not my son thither again.
[1:39:44] again means for the second time
[1:39:50] means in the mystery of life
[1:39:54] at some point Isaac was in Mesopotamia
[1:40:01] ABRAHAM
[1:40:03] DOESN'T want Isaac TO GO BACK THERE
[1:40:05] AGAIN
[1:40:08] SAYING, "Just bring the bride.
[1:40:13] Don't take my son again."
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; And the servant put his hand under the
[1:40:21] thigh of Abraham his master and swear to
[1:40:25] him concerning that matter.
[1:40:37] Okay, maybe let's read a bit faster. The
[1:40:39] servant took 10 camels of the camels of
[1:40:42] his master and departed for all the
[1:40:44] goods of his master were in his hand.
[1:40:47] And he rose and went to Moses unto the
[1:40:50] city of N.
[1:41:08] demand his camels to kneel down without
[1:41:10] the city by the well of water at the
[1:41:13] time of the evening even the time that
[1:41:15] women go out to draw water.
[1:41:30] He said, "Oh Lord, God of my master
[1:41:33] Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed
[1:41:36] this day and show kindness unto my
[1:41:38] master Abraham.
[1:41:48] Behold, I stand here by the well of
[1:41:50] water, and the daughters of men of the
[1:41:53] city come out to draw water.
[1:42:03] Let it come to pass that the danszel to
[1:42:05] whom I shall say, let down thy pitch, I
[1:42:08] pray thee, that I may drink, and she
[1:42:09] shall say, drink. Now I will give thy
[1:42:12] camels drink also. Let the same be be
[1:42:16] she that thou has appointed unto thy
[1:42:18] servant Isaac. And thereby shall I know
[1:42:21] that thou has showed kindness unto my
[1:42:24] master.
[1:42:50] IT CAME TO PASS BEFORE HE HAD DONE
[1:42:53] speaking that behold Rebecca came out
[1:42:57] who was born to Bethuuel son of Mila the
[1:43:01] wife of Nahol Abraham's brother with her
[1:43:04] picture upon his shoulder and the damsel
[1:43:07] was fair to look upon. A virgin neither
[1:43:09] had any men known her. She went down to
[1:43:12] the well, filled her picture and came
[1:43:14] out.
[1:43:43] The servant ran to meet her and said,
[1:43:45] "Let me I pray thee a little water of
[1:43:47] thy picture." And she said, "Drink, my
[1:43:50] lord." And she hasted and let down a
[1:43:52] pitch upon hand and gave him drink.
[1:43:58] USA.
[1:44:11] And when she had done giving him drink,
[1:44:13] she said, I'll draw water for thy camels
[1:44:15] also until they have done drinking. She
[1:44:18] emptied and she hasted and emptied her
[1:44:21] picture into the trough and ran again
[1:44:23] unto the well to draw water and drew for
[1:44:26] all his camels. Amen.
[1:44:41] Nangua.
[1:44:53] Now,
[1:44:55] Genesis chapter 24
[1:44:59] is a special scripture.
[1:45:03] I think all the preachers have touched
[1:45:04] on it.
[1:45:07] This scripture
[1:45:09] is an end time scripture.
[1:45:14] IT IS A TIMELESS PARABLE.
[1:45:20] The way it is written,
[1:45:24] IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE MOSES TAKES THE
[1:45:28] PERSONALITY OF THE PERSON IN the play
[1:45:31] when he's writing it.
[1:45:39] You know, Moses wrote the pentat
[1:45:44] or the Torah,
[1:45:46] the first five books of the Bible.
[1:45:50] BUT THERE IS CERTAIN THINGS THAT MOSES
[1:45:53] WOULD DO AS HE'S WRITING.
[1:45:57] HE WOULD TAKE THE PERSONALITIES
[1:46:01] OF THE INDIVIDUALS IN HIS NARRATION
[1:46:06] UNTIL IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT WAS
[1:46:08] SOMEBODY WHO WAS NOT LIVING IN THAT DAY
[1:46:11] WHO WROTE THE PART.
[1:46:17] HE WILL SAY, "AND MOSES THE SERVANT OF
[1:46:20] THE LORD
[1:46:22] WENT up Mount Nebo
[1:46:26] AND GOD SHOWED HIM THE CITY
[1:46:29] AND THEN HE FOUND A ROCK ON THE MOUNTAIN
[1:46:32] AND HE GAVE UP THE GHOST
[1:46:36] AND HE died
[1:46:42] is Moses. WRITING
[1:46:45] ABOUT THE DEATH OF MOSES
[1:46:52] IN YOUR BIBLE
[1:46:55] IN GENESIS 24.
[1:46:58] FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THIS SCRIPTURE,
[1:47:02] WE MUST UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXTUAL
[1:47:04] TYPOLOGY OF THEIR PLACE.
[1:47:10] WE HAVE ABRAHAM
[1:47:12] AND FOR OUR SERMON TODAY,
[1:47:16] WE KNOW ABRAHAM TYPES A FRIEND OF GOD.
[1:47:21] MANY TIMES, BROTHER BRHAM TYPIFIES
[1:47:23] HIMSELF TO ABRAHAM
[1:47:28] saying he had seven LETTERS
[1:47:32] ending with Ham.
[1:47:37] I KNOW THAT.
[1:47:39] BUT FOR TODAY, ABRAHAM IS NOT A PROPHET.
[1:47:44] ABRAHAM
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; IS A TYPE OF ELOHIM.
[1:47:49] HE'S A TYPE OF GOD IN THIS EQUATION.
[1:47:53] THE BIBLE SAYS HE WAS WELL STRICKEN IN
[1:47:55] AGE.
[1:47:57] In Genesis 24
[1:48:00] is a parallel
[1:48:03] OF REVELATION 10.
[1:48:06] AND IN REVELATION 10,
[1:48:09] IT SAYS, "I SAW A MIGHTY ANGEL COMING UP
[1:48:14] CLOTHED WITH A CLOUD."
[1:48:16] IN OTHER WORDS, THE HAIR WAS WHITE AS
[1:48:19] WOOL.
[1:48:22] AND ONE SIGN OF OLD AGE
[1:48:27] IS WHITE HAIR.
[1:48:30] IN THIS EQUATION,
[1:48:33] ABRAHAM IS THE ANCIENT OF DAYS.
[1:48:39] GOD WHO IS BLESSED IN ALL THINGS.
[1:48:43] AND ABRAHAM,
[1:48:45] HE HAS A PLAN OF REDEMPTION
[1:48:48] TO REDEEM A BRIDE
[1:48:52] FOR HIS SON ISAAC.
[1:48:55] SO ABRAHAM
[1:48:57] REPRESENTS GOD.
[1:49:00] WHO HOLDS THE SECRET
[1:49:03] OF THE REDEMPTION OF THE BRIDE
[1:49:06] AND THE BRIDE IS TO BE REDEEMED.
[1:49:10] SO ONE CALLED ISAAC
[1:49:14] AND HE SAYS I DON'T WANT A FOREIGN BRIDE
[1:49:22] BECAUSE I'M LIVING IN A FOREIGN LAND.
[1:49:26] I live in THE LAND OF CANAAN.
[1:49:29] WHERE THEY ARE CANAANITES,
[1:49:32] A cursed people,
[1:49:37] A PEOPLE IN THE LAND.
[1:49:40] HE SAYS, "I WANT YOU TO GO TO MESOPOTAM
[1:49:44] in a land OF
[1:49:48] THE PEOPLE THAT I DWELL WITH
[1:49:52] AND FIND A BRIDE FOR MY SON.
[1:50:00] ISAAC
[1:50:02] REPRESENTS THE SON OF GOD
[1:50:05] WHO IS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[1:50:09] NOW ISAAC
[1:50:11] WAS THE ONLY SON
[1:50:14] OF ABRA.
[1:50:16] CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:50:18] ISAAC
[1:50:20] WAS THE ONLY SON
[1:50:23] OF ABRAHAM.
[1:50:24] AND SOME THEOLOGIAN WILL ASK ME
[1:50:28] AND SAY, "NO,
[1:50:30] ISAAC
[1:50:32] WAS THE SECOND BORN
[1:50:34] BECAUSE THE FIRST BORN
[1:50:37] WAS ISHMAEL."
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; ISHMAEL
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; WAS NOT THE SON
[1:50:43] OF ABRA.
[1:50:45] BUT ISHMAEL
[1:50:47] WAS THE SON OF ABRA.
[1:50:52] HEY.
[1:50:54] AMEN.
[1:50:57] IS
[1:50:59] A SON OF ABRAHAM.
[1:51:02] ABRAHAM SON OF ABRAHAM.
[1:51:07] THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAYS
[1:51:10] GENESIS 24
[1:51:12] AFTER
[1:51:15] a three days JOURNEY
[1:51:19] TO GO AND SACRIFICE ISAAC.
[1:51:22] GOD COMES BACK TO ABRA.
[1:51:24] HE SAYS, "BECAUSE
[1:51:27] YOU HAVE LISTENED TO ME AND YOU HAVE NOT
[1:51:30] REFUSED
[1:51:32] TO SACRIFICE THY SON
[1:51:36] ONLY."
[1:51:40] IN OTHER WORDS,
[1:51:42] GOD
[1:51:45] IS NOT REGARDED
[1:51:48] BECAUSE THE NAME OF ABRA.
[1:51:55] I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THERE ARE THINGS
[1:51:58] THAT YOU DID IN YOUR LIFE
[1:52:01] BEFORE YOUR NAME WAS CHANGED
[1:52:05] IN YOUR LIFE BEFORE YOU RECEIVED THE
[1:52:08] HOLY GHOST
[1:52:09] WAS NOT THE CHILD OF ABRAHAM'S
[1:52:15] BEHAVIOR
[1:52:19] does not recognize it.
[1:52:22] THAT'S WHY
[1:52:24] WHEN THEY WERE WRITING A COMMENTARY
[1:52:30] and Paul was WRITING
[1:52:33] BY FAITH
[1:52:36] NOT
[1:52:38] UNBELIEF
[1:52:42] till the very END
[1:52:46] WITH YOUR MISTAKES
[1:52:48] DOES NOT RECOGNIZE
[1:52:51] THE PLAN OF
[1:52:53] HOW I WISH
[1:52:55] ONE DAY IS BEING WRITTEN
[1:53:00] THAT THEY WILL NOT FIND FAULT WITH ME.
[1:53:04] I HAVE to take off this jacket.
[1:53:09] Amen.
[1:53:12] BROTHER, BROTHER,
[1:53:14] I WISH ONE DAY WHEN THEY WRITE ABOUT ME
[1:53:18] NOT FIND WITH ME
[1:53:21] BROTHER
[1:53:23] GOD CAN ALLOW HIM
[1:53:26] THROUGH TIME
[1:53:29] WHAT I'M PREACHING
[1:53:31] PEOPLE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH
[1:53:34] AND FINDS NO MISTAKE
[1:53:40] with your SAID
[1:53:45] WHEN THE TEXTMAN CAME,
[1:53:49] I lied.
[1:53:52] Who told you that?
[1:53:54] WHO TOLD YOU THAT? BROTHER LI
[1:53:59] IT WAS BROTHER
[1:54:01] WHO TOLD YOU THAT I LIKE. HOW DO YOU USE
[1:54:05] something that I tell you?
[1:54:14] BECAUSE HE SAID HE LIED.
[1:54:16] MY QUESTION IS WHEN I WAS TELLING YOU
[1:54:18] THAT I LIED, WAS I LYING OR WAS I
[1:54:34] ARE YOU HEARING WHAT I'M SAYING? HOW DO
[1:54:37] YOU SAY SUCH A MAN LIE?
[1:54:40] EVEN THE BEST LIGHTERS THAT ARE LIVING
[1:54:42] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR,
[1:54:46] THEY HAVE ZERO CONTENT.
[1:54:50] THEY HAVE TO USE THE MESSAGE
[1:54:53] TO CRITICIZE THE MESSAGE BECAUSE ON
[1:54:56] THEIR OWN THEY CANNOT STAND.
[1:55:02] AGAIN
[1:55:10] OF REDEMPTION.
[1:55:12] HE was the ONLY
[1:55:18] SON
[1:55:25] WAS A PRODUCT OF IMPATIENCE.
[1:55:30] IT WAS A WORD THAT WAS BELIEVED BY
[1:55:32] SARAH.
[1:55:35] IT WAS NOT ENTIRELY UNBELIEF.
[1:55:40] SARAH BELIEVED THE PROMISE.
[1:55:43] BUT SHE JUST DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT IT
[1:55:44] could be fulfilled in her flesh.
[1:55:48] THAT'S WHY SHE SAID THIS GOSPEL I
[1:55:49] BELIEVE
[1:55:52] IT WITH HER.
[1:55:54] SO WAS MENTAL CONCEPTION.
[1:56:00] BUT PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION,
[1:56:06] SHE WAS A MISTAKE IN GENESIS 16
[1:56:11] which was corrected in Genesis 16.
[1:56:18] IT IT MEANS IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE,
[1:56:21] YOU MUST CORRECT YOUR MISTAKE IN THE
[1:56:23] SAME CHAPTER.
[1:56:33] WAS A PRODUCT OF IMPATIENCE.
[1:56:38] ISAAC
[1:56:42] WAS A PRODUCT OF IMPATIENCE.
[1:56:47] NOW I WANT TO DROP a bomb.
[1:56:50] So I'm preparing you
[1:56:52] brother say now you can put your
[1:56:54] spiritual
[1:56:59] CABIN CREW
[1:57:01] FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELS for take OFF
[1:57:06] WAS A PRODUCT OF DOUBT.
[1:57:13] That's why I said you need to put ON A
[1:57:15] SHIRT.
[1:57:17] ISAAC WAS A PRODUCT OF DOUBT
[1:57:23] BECAUSE SARAH WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BRING
[1:57:26] FORTH ISAAC
[1:57:30] son of ABRAHAM
[1:57:33] WHO WAS NOT ISAAC.
[1:57:36] IT WAS JESUS CHRIST. YES. CRYSTAL. AMEN.
[1:57:41] AH. AMEN. YES. AH. AND NOW WE ARE
[1:57:45] TOGETHER. WE ARE TOGETHER. WATCH THIS.
[1:57:48] WHEN GENESIS 18 HAPPENS
[1:57:52] WHEN ELOHIM COMES OUTSIDE THE TENT,
[1:57:57] HE SAYS THE VISIT WAS NOT ABRAHAM.
[1:58:03] That visit WAS
[1:58:06] BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS HAPPENING
[1:58:09] WAS ALL ABOUT SARAH. THAT'S WHY THE
[1:58:12] FIRST THING HE ASKED
[1:58:15] HE DOESN'T ASK.
[1:58:19] HE SAYS
[1:58:21] THY WIFE.
[1:58:27] He says, "I AM HERE
[1:58:30] TO PERFORM THAT WHICH I PROMISE
[1:58:34] IN THE PROCESS OF TIME
[1:58:37] THY WIFE SHALL HAVE A SONNESS
[1:58:43] of the women of the Bible.
[1:58:47] It's not a sickness.
[1:58:51] of barren women in THE BIBLE
[1:58:56] because they WERE SICK.
[1:58:59] GOD NEVER PROTECTED THE MAN,
[1:59:02] BUT GOD PROTECTED THE WOMAN.
[1:59:05] THAT'S WHY
[1:59:08] NO MATTER HOW MUCH PROSTITUTION SHE
[1:59:10] COMMITTED,
[1:59:12] SHE SLEPT WITH ALL THE MEN IN JERICHO,
[1:59:16] SHE NEVER FELL PREGNANT.
[1:59:19] WHY? BECAUSE ONE DAY
[1:59:23] WOULD COME
[1:59:25] OUT OF THE WOMB OF A GENTILE
[1:59:31] will be brought.
[1:59:35] LISTEN TO ME. SHE WAS PROTECTED.
[1:59:39] GOD WAS PROTECTING THE WOMAN
[1:59:44] BECAUSE SHE WAS MARRIED TO ME. WHAT?
[1:59:47] BECAUSE SHE WAS MARRIED TO MY
[1:59:50] NEVER HAD A CHILD.
[1:59:54] They never had a child.
[2:00:03] That's the SAME
[2:00:09] TIME
[2:00:13] of God.
[2:00:18] ISAAC CAME.
[2:00:19] THE PROMISE WAS HANGING AROUND LOOKING
[2:00:28] BECAUSE JESUS CHRIST IS NOT THE SEAT OF
[2:00:31] A MAN
[2:00:35] is not the SEAT OF A MAN BECAUSE THE
[2:00:38] SCRIPTURE PROPHESIED
[2:00:43] that the SEED OF THE WOMAN
[2:00:46] SHALL BRUISE. AT THE HEAD OF THE
[2:00:49] SERPENT.
[2:00:51] SO WHILE THE DEVIL
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; WAS LOOKING AT THE LINEAGE OF JUDAH
[2:00:57] PROMISE
[2:00:59] ANGRY
[2:01:07] AND SAID
[2:01:10] you are CHOSEN
[2:01:16] TO RECEIVE THE MESSAGE
[2:01:18] HOW CAN IT EXPLAIN
[2:01:25] TO ME
[2:01:39] MYSTERY
[2:01:47] NAME. JESUS.
[2:01:50] YES.
[2:02:06] HE'S WAITING FOR THE PEOPLE.
[2:02:12] ACCORDING
[2:02:20] TO THE
[2:02:26] HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE JESUS CHRIST.
[2:02:31] The Holy GHOST SAYS STAY ON THIS POINT.
[2:02:33] The Holy Ghost SAYS STAY ON THIS.
[2:02:36] THAT'S WHY ABRAHAM TAKES HIM ON A THREE
[2:02:41] DAYS JOURNEY.
[2:02:43] TO MOUNT MARIAH
[2:02:46] SACRIFICING.
[2:02:48] WHY WAS HE supposed to be sacrificed?
[2:02:51] HOW CAN
[2:02:54] ISAAC BE SACRIFICED?
[2:02:56] WHAT IS
[2:02:58] A FIGURE OF WHAT CHRIST WAS SUPPOSED TO
[2:03:10] SAY?
[2:03:12] THAT'S NOT JESUS NAME.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE JESUS.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT JESUS NAME.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; WAIT A MINUTE.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT SIDE.
[2:03:22] TO THE RIGHT.
[2:03:24] THERE WAS A WAY.
[2:03:29] WHAT IS
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY. DON'T WORRY. THE SITUATION
[2:03:39] IS UNDER CONTROL.
[2:03:41] HERE. I'M IN CONTROL
[2:03:44] OF THAT FOLLOWING
[2:03:51] the ticket.
[2:03:56] A male ship.
[2:04:01] IT WAS HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY FROM
[2:04:03] CIVILIZATION.
[2:04:07] No way.
[2:04:15] SEE THIS
[2:04:17] WAS NOT BORN.
[2:04:20] IT WAS CREATED.
[2:04:22] IT WAS A SPOKEN
[2:04:33] FATHER
[2:04:37] BEGINNING.
[2:04:52] WHY? WHY? BECAUSE WHEN JESUS COMES,
[2:04:56] YOU WILL BE GIVEN A CROWN.
[2:05:02] HOW MANY DAYS?
[2:05:06] WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK? HE SAYS, I GO
[2:05:09] TO SACRIFICE WITH THE LORD.
[2:05:15] WE WILL BE BACK. AND CHRIST WAS
[2:05:18] CRUCIFIED.
[2:05:26] OH,
[2:05:30] bring it up again.
[2:05:43] I didn't want to go there. I didn't want
[2:05:46] TO GO THERE.
[2:05:48] BUT I thought someone is doubting it.
[2:05:51] IT ENDED UP BENEFITING US.
[2:05:54] THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAYS IN THE BOOK OF
[2:05:57] HEBREWS
[2:05:59] ISAAC
[2:06:01] RECEIVED LIKE ONE UNTO THE DEAD.
[2:06:10] IN OTHER WORDS, ISAAC DIED AND
[2:06:12] RESURRECTED ON THE MOUNTAIN. HALLELUJAH.
[2:06:18] BECAUSE HE WAS A FIGURE OF CHRIST
[2:06:22] only begotten OF THE FATHER.
[2:06:26] THAT'S character number two.
[2:06:29] NOW CHARACTER NUMBER THREE. THE NAME IS
[2:06:32] NOT GIVEN IN THIS SCRIPT.
[2:06:35] IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE HE'S THE ONE THAT
[2:06:38] IS WRITING the scripture.
[2:06:42] HE'S THE SERVANT OF ABRAHAM.
[2:06:46] THAT RULED THE GREATER PORTION OF THE
[2:06:49] KINGDOM OF ABRAHAM.
[2:06:53] THOUGH HIS NAME IS NOT HERE,
[2:06:56] THOUGH HIS NAME IS NOT HERE,
[2:06:59] IT IS WRITTEN SOMEWHERE. WE KNOW HIS
[2:07:02] NAME.
[2:07:03] HIS NAME IS ELAZA.
[2:07:07] ELAZAR
[2:07:09] WAS A PROPHET.
[2:07:13] AMEN. BECAUSE WHEN YOU SAY ABRAHAM IS
[2:07:16] GOD
[2:07:18] AND IS THE FRIEND OF
[2:07:22] ABRAHAM,
[2:07:24] IT PUTS ELAZA TO BE A PROPHET.
[2:07:29] ELAZA WAS OF DAMASCUS
[2:07:32] AND DAMASCUS WAS LOCATED IN THE NORTH.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And brother Brham is preaching in
[2:07:43] another place.
[2:07:45] And while HE WAS PREACHING THERE,
[2:07:47] THERE CAME a note
[2:07:50] that was written.
[2:07:52] THUS SAY THE LORD, I will send a prophet
[2:07:57] and you preach IN THIS TABERNACLE
[2:08:00] and is a prophet from the north.
[2:08:03] And I'm glad that though we are in East
[2:08:05] Africa,
[2:08:08] America is still in THE NORTH TO US.
[2:08:17] OF DAMASCUS.
[2:08:19] WHEN WHEN ABRAHAM LOOKED
[2:08:22] WHO COULD CARRY THE MISSION
[2:08:24] ONLY QUALIFIED
[2:08:28] HE RULED THE GREATER PORTION OF THE
[2:08:30] KINGDOM OF GOD.
[2:08:34] ONE DAY BROTHER BRANA WAS PREACHING
[2:08:38] WAS saying certain things IN A CERTAIN
[2:08:39] WAY.
[2:08:41] THE BROTHER THOUGHT THIS IS REVELATION
[2:08:43] 23.
[2:08:46] Just like I preached on Genesis 0
[2:08:48] yesterday
[2:08:51] also revelation 23
[2:08:54] the seals AT THE BACK SIDE OF THE BOOK.
[2:08:57] AND THE BROTHER WANTED TO SAY THAT
[2:09:00] AND HIS NAME WAS DENNY HENRY
[2:09:03] HENRY AND HE FIND HIMSELF SPEAKING IN
[2:09:05] FRENCH.
[2:09:07] AND THERE WAS A THERE WAS A BROTHER
[2:09:13] WHO WAS A FRENCH SPEAKING BROTHER.
[2:09:16] AND HE SAID THAT IS PURE FRENCH.
[2:09:20] AND THERE WAS A UN INTERPRETER
[2:09:23] WHO INTERPRETED FRENCH
[2:09:26] AND THEY WROTE THEIR INTERPRETATION
[2:09:30] OF WHAT THEN HENRY SPOKE
[2:09:34] AND THE INTERPRETATION WAS
[2:09:37] BECAUSE YOU HAVE CHOSEN
[2:09:40] THE NARROW PATHWAY.
[2:09:44] IT IS NOT YOUR CHOOSING
[2:09:46] BUT MY CHOOSING
[2:09:49] AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS
[2:09:52] THAT BUT A GREAT PORTION
[2:09:55] HEAVEN IS AWAITING YOU
[2:09:59] WHO HAS A GREAT PORTION
[2:10:02] IN HEAVEN
[2:10:06] AND THE HEART OF ABRAHAM.
[2:10:10] AMEN. I'm not going to simplify this
[2:10:12] one.
[2:10:14] I will LEAVE IT LIKE THAT.
[2:10:17] AND ABRAHAM SAYS,
[2:10:20] "COME
[2:10:21] PUT YOUR HANDS UNDER MY THIGH."
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; NOW THE THIGH IS A SECRET PLACE FOR THE
[2:10:28] WIFE.
[2:10:31] ONLY THE WIFE OF A MAN SHOULD SEE THE
[2:10:34] THIGH.
[2:10:38] Can you say amen? Can't be going around
[2:10:41] seeing people's eyes here.
[2:10:45] It's reserved FOR THE WIFE
[2:10:48] AND THE THIGH
[2:10:50] IS A euphemism
[2:10:53] is a euphemism for the loins
[2:10:57] a soft word. Okay.
[2:11:05] SO THE BIBLE USES EUPHEMISM
[2:11:11] TO EXPLAIN COMPLEX THINGS.
[2:11:16] It will say they ate a fruit in the
[2:11:19] garden.
[2:11:23] But the eating of the fruit is the
[2:11:24] committing of adulter.
[2:11:28] THE THE BIBLE WILL SAY URIAH SHOULD COME
[2:11:31] BACK FROM WAR AND GO AND WASH HIS WIFE
[2:11:34] WIFE'S FEET.
[2:11:41] THE WASHING OF THE WIFE'S FEET
[2:11:45] IS a euphemism of the intimacy of your
[2:11:47] husband IN
[2:11:52] IT SAYS AND SO WENT INTO THE CAVE TO
[2:11:55] COVER HIS FEET.
[2:11:59] THE COVERING OF THE FEET
[2:12:02] FOR DEFECATION.
[2:12:09] So you see even that I'm saying I'm
[2:12:11] using defecation. I'm using a euphemism
[2:12:13] to explain another euphemism.
[2:12:18] SO WHEN HE SAYS THE LOINS THE WHEN HE
[2:12:20] SAYS THAT THIGHS IS A EUPHEMISM FOR THE
[2:12:22] LOINS OF a man.
[2:12:31] BUT NOW
[2:12:33] THE LOINS OF GOD ARE NOT IN HIS
[2:12:35] WAISTLINE.
[2:12:40] HIS LOINS ARE IN HIS MIND.
[2:12:43] HIS
[2:12:45] SEED IS IN THE MIND.
[2:12:48] IT MEANS
[2:12:51] IS A MAN THAT GOD GIVES ACCESS
[2:12:58] to his LOINS
[2:13:01] WHICH IS THE MIND OF
[2:13:08] THAT'S WHY WHEN SEVEN ANGELS COME DOWN
[2:13:14] WHEN THE PICTURE IS TAKEN,
[2:13:17] WHEN THE PICTURE IS TAKEN,
[2:13:21] IT IS A PICTURE OF THE HEAD OF CHRIST.
[2:13:27] IT IS ALSO THE COMING DOWN OF OUR
[2:13:29] HEADSHIP.
[2:13:34] AND IT IS IN THE HEAD WHERE YOU FIND THE
[2:13:36] LOINS OF GOD.
[2:13:42] THE SEED OF GOD IS
[2:13:45] THAT'S WHY WILLIAM BRHAM IS TAKEN INTO
[2:13:48] THE MIND
[2:13:51] INTO THE HEAD OF GOD
[2:13:55] the seed OF GOD
[2:13:58] supposed to claim another.
[2:14:02] THAT'S WHY HE SAYS THY NAME IN THE BOOK
[2:14:06] IS NOT LIKE LEVI
[2:14:09] OR NEVI.
[2:14:12] BUT IT IS THE MYSTERY NAME
[2:14:17] WHO YOU ARE WHO WILL PREACH THE MESSAGE.
[2:14:21] WE DON'T ASK FOR A LIST OF NAMES.
[2:14:27] THE PREACHING IS IN A MYSTERY.
[2:14:31] WHEN I MEET YOU OUTSIDE THERE,
[2:14:34] YOU SAY, "PASTOR,
[2:14:36] YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT ME.
[2:14:39] HOW DID I KNOW?
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME.
[2:14:45] NO ONE that is PREACHING
[2:14:48] YOUR NAME.
[2:14:50] YOUR NAME
[2:14:52] IS NOT
[2:14:56] MY NAME.
[2:14:58] WILLIAM
[2:15:00] WAS NOT WILLIAM
[2:15:03] FOR A LONG TIME. HE WAS CALLED WILLIAM
[2:15:06] BR.
[2:15:08] BUT IN THE MESSAGE COMMUNION,
[2:15:11] HE SAYS, "I HAVE COME TO REALIZE
[2:15:15] I'M NOT a son.
[2:15:27] ANOTHER
[2:15:36] KENYA AUSTRALIAN
[2:15:39] A WHITE BROTHER
[2:15:42] FELLOWSHIP WITH A BLACK BROTHER
[2:15:47] GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION
[2:15:54] WHEN WE WERE IN HEAVEN WE WERE THE
[2:15:58] OH SON OF GOD
[2:16:04] YOU
[2:16:05] NO DIFFERENCE
[2:16:08] YOU AND YOUR SISTERALE
[2:16:21] WE ARE THE SAME
[2:16:23] THE WORLD IS WAITING
[2:16:27] FOR THE MANIFESTATION OF DEMONS.
[2:16:31] NO, NO, NO. THE WORLD IS WAITING.
[2:16:43] When I SAY
[2:16:50] son of GOD
[2:16:53] is the son of
[2:17:03] time.
[2:17:13] WE WERE IN PREVIEW
[2:17:16] WHEN BROTHER WAS SEEING THE
[2:17:21] PREVIEW
[2:17:23] BUT NOW IT'S NO LONGER A PREVIEW.
[2:17:28] BROTHER, BROTHER
[2:17:39] by the prophet OF
[2:17:53] MANIFESTATION.
[2:18:03] THE SON OF A DOG
[2:18:05] IS A DOG. THE SON OF A PIG IS A PIG. THE
[2:18:10] SON OF A LION IS A LION.
[2:18:14] OF GOD.
[2:18:24] AMEN.
[2:18:25] YOU SEE A DOG OUT THERE. THE REASON WHY
[2:18:28] YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND A DOG IS BECAUSE
[2:18:31] YOU ARE NOT A DOG. YOU CAN NEVER
[2:18:34] UNDERSTAND DOG BEHAVIOR.
[2:18:37] The reason WHY YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE
[2:18:39] COWS.
[2:18:40] YOU ARE NOT A COW.
[2:18:42] THAT'S WHY YOU CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND
[2:18:45] THINGS.
[2:18:47] THE REASON WHY THE WORLD DOES NOT
[2:18:49] UNDERSTAND US
[2:18:52] HUMAN BEINGS
[2:18:54] ARE A MUCH
[2:19:08] WAKING THEIR
[2:19:17] GOD
[2:19:20] is the GATHERING
[2:19:23] OF MY
[2:19:25] ONE OF FIRE. ANOTHER LIQU
[2:19:32] FROM EVERY DISTRICT
[2:19:38] of fire.
[2:19:45] HALLELUJAH.
[2:19:47] AMEN.
[2:19:52] FORCH.
[2:20:29] GOD GIVES BIRTH TO GOD.
[2:20:36] GOD IS BEST TO GOD.
[2:20:51] DON'T LET THE WORLD
[2:20:54] DON'T LET THE WORLD TELL YOU OTHERWISE.
[2:20:57] YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT YOU.
[2:21:03] YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT YOU.
[2:21:05] CERTIFICATE.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS NOT YOU.
[2:21:11] YOUR FAMILY BACKGROUND IS NOT YOU.
[2:21:14] WHO ARE YOU?
[2:21:16] I AM GOD.
[2:21:22] CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[2:21:25] WHEN LUCIFER FELL
[2:21:28] WHEN LUCIFER FELL,
[2:21:30] GOD NEVER CAME DOWN. THERE'S NOTHING TO
[2:21:33] DO WITH HIM.
[2:21:35] ADAM FELL DOWN.
[2:21:40] ANGELS NEVER
[2:21:46] MIND.
[2:21:59] WHEN GOD SAID ADAM,
[2:22:01] HE WAS NOT REPEATING HIMSELF. NO, NO,
[2:22:04] NO, NO, NO. HE SAID MALE AND FEMALE
[2:22:08] CREATED HE THEM AND HE CALLED THEIR
[2:22:12] NAME.
[2:22:15] THE WOMAN WAS ADAM. THE MAN WAS ADAM.
[2:22:21] EVE COMES AFTER THE FALL.
[2:22:25] I SAY I'M NOT TALKING TO EVE. I'M
[2:22:28] TALKING TO ADAM. ADAM,
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU?
[2:22:34] ADAM,
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU?
[2:22:39] STARTED TALKING ABOUT THINGS SURROUNDING
[2:22:41] HIM.
[2:22:43] MY WIFE DID THIS.
[2:22:47] GOD WAS NOT LOOKING FOR ADAM
[2:22:51] FOR his condition.
[2:22:54] NO,
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS LOOKING FOR ADAM FROM HIS
[2:22:59] POSITION.
[2:23:01] WHERE ARE YOU IS A CONSULTATION OF
[2:23:03] POSITION, NOT CONDITION.
[2:23:09] HE DIDN'T SAY WHAT.
[2:23:12] HE SAYS, "WHERE ARE YOU
[2:23:15] TONIGHT?
[2:23:17] TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE DONE."
[2:23:20] MY QUESTION IS, "WHY HAVE YOU LEFT YOUR
[2:23:22] POSITION?
[2:23:25] Why have you left?
[2:23:30] WHY HAVE YOU LEFT YOUR SPOKEN WORD
[2:23:33] POSITION?
[2:23:34] WHY HAVE YOU LEFT YOUR AUTHORITY? YOU
[2:23:38] ARE NOT A SON BECAUSE OF CONDITIONS.
[2:23:42] YOU ARE A SON BECAUSE OF POSITION.
[2:23:45] THAT'S WHY TEACHING IS IMPORTANT IN THE
[2:23:47] MINISTRY
[2:23:49] BECAUSE THIS SHOWS THE BELIEVER.
[2:24:00] AND IF YOU READ EPHESIANS 4
[2:24:04] 11, IF YOU CAN DISPLAY IT, HE SAYS, "AND
[2:24:07] HE GAVE SOME
[2:24:10] APOSTLES,
[2:24:12] SOME
[2:24:13] TEACHERS, SOME EVANGELISTS,
[2:24:19] PASTORS,
[2:24:20] and
[2:24:24] there's no NOW
[2:24:28] TEACHERS DOESN'T COME WITH
[2:24:31] BECAUSE IT'S SPECIAL.
[2:24:34] SAME.
[2:24:37] Sit a little.
[2:24:41] Sit a little.
[2:24:56] So we see Elaza,
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; his brother Brham,
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; the eagle from the north,
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; the prophet to carry out a mission
[2:25:11] to get a bride for Isaac.
[2:25:15] Are you seeing that? And the Bible says
[2:25:18] he arrives at the well in the evening
[2:25:20] time.
[2:25:23] He doesn't go alone.
[2:25:25] He goes with the angel OF GOD.
[2:25:29] Says he sends his angel to go WITH HIM.
[2:25:33] You want to know today
[2:25:36] LOOK FOR A MAN WITH THE angel of THE
[2:25:39] LORD.
[2:25:41] HE GOES WITH THE ANGEL OF THE LORD.
[2:25:45] HE DOES NOTHING.
[2:25:47] BUT HE SAYS, "I AM WAITING
[2:25:49] FOR THAT ANGEL."
[2:25:52] ARE YOU seeing that?
[2:25:57] HE'S WAITING FOR THAT ANGEL.
[2:26:00] HE DOESN'T GO ALONE. HE HAS GOT
[2:26:03] SERVANTS.
[2:26:06] OTHER SERVANTS THAT HE GOES WITH MEANING
[2:26:09] THE MINISTRY OF BROTHER BRAN
[2:26:13] IS ACCOMPANIED BY THE FIVE-FOLD
[2:26:15] MINISTRY.
[2:26:18] AMEN. REBECCA WAS NOT REDEEMED BY ELAZA
[2:26:23] ALONE.
[2:26:27] ELAZA HAD SERVANTS THAT HE WAS WITH
[2:26:32] AND THEY WERE NOT ALONE. ALL OF THEM.
[2:26:36] THEY HAD THE ANGEL OF THE LORD.
[2:26:39] THEY HAD 10 CAMELS.
[2:26:44] BROTHER SAY A CAMEL IS A beast
[2:26:49] and a beast is a symbol of power.
[2:26:54] THEIR MINISTRIES go with the Holy GHOST
[2:26:59] FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE REDEMPTION OF
[2:27:01] THE BRIDE
[2:27:04] AND THEY ARRIVE AT THE WELL IN THE
[2:27:06] EVENING TIME.
[2:27:09] I'm rushing. I'M WINDING DOWN.
[2:27:12] Carin cruise fasten your seat belts for
[2:27:15] landing
[2:27:19] for take off. Now we must pass.
[2:27:24] NOW
[2:27:28] HE DOES NOT GET INTO THE CITY.
[2:27:33] HE DOESN'T START BY MIXING WITH THE
[2:27:35] DENOMINATIONS.
[2:27:37] THE BRIDE
[2:27:39] IS NOT CAUGHT IN THE CITY.
[2:27:43] SHE
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; IS CAUGHT OUTSIDE OF THE CITY.
[2:27:48] I wish I could preach about the city
[2:27:51] and show you how the city becomes a
[2:27:54] denominational place.
[2:27:58] Because even the wise men when they got
[2:28:00] into the city, the star disappeared.
[2:28:07] That's why if you want to achieve things
[2:28:08] with God,
[2:28:10] avoid camps,
[2:28:13] don't get into world cities.
[2:28:18] We believe it this way. No, no, no.
[2:28:22] Never put a full stop.
[2:28:26] Always put a comma.
[2:28:34] There are many people that have REJECTED
[2:28:35] THE TRUTH
[2:28:37] BECAUSE THEY PUT full stops where they
[2:28:38] wanted to put
[2:28:43] you dropped this in 2012.
[2:28:47] I was invited at a certain place in
[2:28:49] Zimbabwe
[2:28:51] and I preached there for 17 years.
[2:28:55] After preaching there, nine tumors
[2:28:58] disappeared.
[2:29:01] Blind eyes were open.
[2:29:04] We had a revolving prayer line.
[2:29:10] People would be struck by the Holy Ghost
[2:29:12] in their home.
[2:29:15] And be brought to the meeting 2012.
[2:29:21] I'm telling you this is a reality.
[2:29:23] And my ministry was characterized by
[2:29:25] that.
[2:29:27] everywhere I go preach.
[2:29:32] Then we went to sit
[2:29:34] uh you know for for for lunch and there
[2:29:37] was this elder
[2:29:40] and this elder was talking.
[2:29:43] I didn't understand what he was talking
[2:29:45] about
[2:29:47] whether he's criticizing or something.
[2:29:50] I knew my heart was right
[2:29:53] but he's just dropping things there
[2:29:58] right
[2:29:59] about the third book know about the
[2:30:02] opening of the word
[2:30:04] they were alien to me some of the things
[2:30:09] what is this elder talking about
[2:30:12] we have arrived
[2:30:14] this is it
[2:30:16] this is the manifestation
[2:30:19] but I didn't put
[2:30:24] It created a thirst in me
[2:30:28] to want to study this message MORE
[2:30:34] down the line.
[2:30:37] I STARTED SEEING
[2:30:40] ON MY OWN.
[2:30:43] This is what that ELDER
[2:30:46] WAS TRYING TO TELL US
[2:30:49] WITHOUT TELLING US,
[2:30:52] WITHOUT CRITICIZING.
[2:30:54] HE WAS JUST DROPPING SEED.
[2:30:58] IF we are TO BE FAITHFUL.
[2:31:01] THIS IS NOT THE CLIMAX
[2:31:04] OF THE HEALING OF THE S. THERE'S
[2:31:06] SOMETHING MORE. YOU DIDN'T SAY IT LIKE
[2:31:09] THAT,
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU ARE SAYING IT SOMEHOW.
[2:31:13] DROPPING IT AS
[2:31:15] THREE YEARS AGO INVITED INTO MY CHURCH.
[2:31:19] I SAID, "YOU MAY NOT KNOW WHAT YOU DID
[2:31:24] IN 2012
[2:31:26] AND HELP ME in my MINISTRY
[2:31:29] PREACHING HERE. SOME OF THE THINGS MIGHT
[2:31:32] SOUND LIKE
[2:31:36] might sound like but no, I don't think
[2:31:37] it's necessary.
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; IF GOD HAS A PURPOSE FOR YOU,
[2:31:43] TAKE THESE SEEDS. JUST LEAVE THEM THERE.
[2:31:47] ONE DAY
[2:31:49] THE INTEREST FOR THE HIDDEN PART OF THE
[2:31:51] MESSAGE
[2:31:54] WILL BE GENERATED IN YOU.
[2:31:58] DOES IT MEAN
[2:32:00] I AM NO LONGER HEALING THE SICK?
[2:32:03] THE SICK ARE TO BE HEALED.
[2:32:06] THE PACKAGE IS THERE IN THE TEMPLE.
[2:32:11] BUT THE HEALING OF THE BODY
[2:32:14] CANNOT BE COMPARED
[2:32:17] TO THE HEALING OF THE SOUL.
[2:32:20] CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[2:32:22] AND THE TREAD POOL
[2:32:25] OF THE SPEAKING THINGS INTO
[2:32:29] has been Pentecostalized.
[2:32:35] IT HAS NOW BECOME A I'LL SPEAK MY INTO
[2:32:37] EXISTENCE. I'LL SPEAK MY DRAMA. I'LL
[2:32:39] SPEAK MY IT HAS BECOME COALIZED. YOU ARE
[2:32:43] TAKING THE MESSAGE WITH THE DENOMINATION
[2:32:45] OF YOU.
[2:32:50] THAT'S WHY
[2:32:52] BROTHER BRANA HE SPEAKS OF THE 10 VISION
[2:32:58] and the fishing TECHNIQUES
[2:33:01] WHERE HE GENERATES THE CONCEPT OF POOLS.
[2:33:06] AND THE BLESSING OF THE LITTLE SHOE.
[2:33:11] In 1956,
[2:33:13] IN 1959,
[2:33:16] HE SPEAKS SQUIRRELS INTO
[2:33:18] HE SPEAKS MOSQUITOES OUT OF EXISTENCE.
[2:33:23] HE REPEATS IT AGAIN
[2:33:25] IN THE MESSAGE OF GRACES WHEN HE
[2:33:27] ANNOUNCES THE SECOND account
[2:33:31] of THE SPEAKING OF SPIRALS.
[2:33:36] HE HAS ALREADY SPOKEN BEFORE
[2:33:39] 61.
[2:33:41] THE PART OF THE THIRD POOL OF SPEAKING
[2:33:43] THINGS INTO AND OUT OF
[2:33:46] HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE TWICE
[2:33:49] ON THE ASPECT OF SPIRALS.
[2:33:54] HE GOES ON TO DEAL WITH THE STORM OF
[2:33:56] KOLERAT
[2:33:58] and that is the third boo
[2:34:01] that you hear being emphasized most of
[2:34:03] the times by ministers
[2:34:07] and it has been used to toel things
[2:34:12] but the the seals were not even
[2:34:14] revealed.
[2:34:17] WHEN THE SEALS ARE REVEALED,
[2:34:20] THEN HE SAYS THIS DEAD POOL
[2:34:24] IS THREE PARTS. THERE'S THE SPEAKING OF
[2:34:26] THINGS INTO AND OUT OF EXISTENCE.
[2:34:31] THERE'S THE OPENING OF THE WORD
[2:34:35] WHICH IS THE ONE
[2:34:38] THAT BRINGS ABOUT A BODY CHANGE.
[2:34:42] AND THERE'S THE ASPECT OF PREACHING TO
[2:34:44] THE TOTAL LORD.
[2:34:47] THE LAST TWO ASPECTS OF THE THIRD BOOK
[2:34:52] IS WHAT IS SCARCELY PREACHED ABOUT.
[2:34:56] AND YET IT IS THE ONE
[2:34:59] THAT BRINGS US INTO THE BODY CHAIN
[2:35:03] ON THE 28TH OF JULY
[2:35:08] 2807
[2:35:09] 1963
[2:35:12] IN THE MESSAGE CHRIST IS THE MYSTERY OF
[2:35:14] GOD WITH YOU.
[2:35:16] BROTHER SAYS IT'S 2:00.
[2:35:19] THE END OF THE SECOND POOL
[2:35:24] is at hand.
[2:35:28] Are you hearing what I'm saying?
[2:35:32] But you spoke spirals ALREADY
[2:35:35] AND YOU'RE not saying the POOL IS A
[2:35:38] WHICH IS HE TALKING ABOUT?
[2:35:42] IT'S THE OPENING OF THE WORD.
[2:35:46] THE BELIEVER RECOGNIZING WHO THEY ARE.
[2:35:50] AND IF EVER I HAVE A MINISTRY,
[2:35:54] I WOULD WANT MY MINISTRY
[2:35:57] TO BE A MINISTRY
[2:36:00] THAT BRINGS THE BRIDE
[2:36:03] INTO REALIZATION
[2:36:06] CONSCIOUSNESS.
[2:36:10] I've already told you a secret.
[2:36:13] I TOLD YOU A SECRET.
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE
[2:36:19] MUST KNOW WHO THEY ARE.
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; I DON'T DESPISE OTHER MINISTRIES
[2:36:25] BECAUSE THE Bible also SAYS PETER
[2:36:28] WHEN YOU ARE CONVERTED
[2:36:31] STRENGTHEN YOUR BRETHREN. THERE ARE
[2:36:33] PEOPLE WITH MINISTRIES TO STRENGTHEN.
[2:36:37] HE JUST COMES TO STRENGTHEN YOU. IT'S
[2:36:40] GOING TO BE WELL. YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE
[2:36:42] IT. YOU ARE AN OVERCOMER. YOU'RE GOING
[2:36:45] TO RECEIVE ANOTHER JOB.
[2:36:49] IT'S OKAY. IT'S A MINISTRY. IT'S IN THE
[2:36:52] BIBLE. IT'S NOT IN PLACE.
[2:36:55] THIS PART
[2:36:58] OF GETTING THE PERSON
[2:37:00] BY REVELATION TO COME TO A PLACE
[2:37:05] WHERE JESUS CAN RISE UP
[2:37:08] AND SAY THOU ART THE CHRIST.
[2:37:13] JESUS SAID SIMON
[2:37:17] FLESH AND BLOOD
[2:37:19] REVEAL THIS TO YOU FROM PASTOR
[2:37:23] FROM BROTHER GEORGE
[2:37:29] BUT MY FATHER
[2:37:32] WHICH IS IN HEAVEN HAS REVEALED IT TO
[2:37:35] YOU.
[2:37:37] YOUR NAME
[2:37:39] SHALL BE CHANGED.

[2:42:05] THE SIZE OF A MAN'S HEAD
[2:42:08] IS A SOUND THE RAIN BELLS IT'S GOING TO

[2:42:14] I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
[2:42:18] it's going TO RAIN

[2:42:54] IS NOT CHARIOTS. I'M NOT GOING TO BE
[2:42:56] MOVING
[2:42:58] USING A CHARIOT.
[2:43:02] What Adam USED
[2:43:06] TO TAKE THE WIND
[2:43:08] GET ON THE WIND. HE WILL TAKE THE
[2:43:11] THUNDERBOLT
[2:43:13] FROM THUNDER AND PUT IT AS THE ENGINE
[2:43:16] AND HE WILL FLASH LIKE LIGHT AND FROM
[2:43:19] ONE POINT FROM AFRICA.
[2:43:22] &gt;&gt; FROM AFRICA,
[2:43:22] &gt;&gt; YOU WOULD BE IN AUSTRALIA FROM
[2:43:24] AUSTRALIA.
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; FROM AUSTRALIA.
[2:43:26] &gt;&gt; FROM AUSTRALIA IN JAPAN.
[2:43:28] &gt;&gt; JAPAN.
[2:43:28] &gt;&gt; FROM JAPAN.
[2:43:30] HE WILL BE BACK IN SOUTH AMERICA
[2:43:32] AND WE SHALL TRAVEL.
[2:43:35] THE SPIRIT OF GOD.
[2:43:41] WE KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE ARE NOT CHEAP.
[2:43:44] YOU ARE NOT CHEAP. YOU ARE NOT CHEAP.
[2:43:50] YOU ARE NOT CHEAP. YOU ARE NOT CHEAP.
[2:43:54] YOU ARE NOT BROKE. YOU ARE NOT POOR. YOU
[2:43:58] ARE NOT BLIND. YOU ARE NOT.
[2:44:01] YOU ARE GOD. YOU ARE SON OF GOD. YOU
[2:44:05] ARE. YOU ARE. YOU ARE.
[2:44:08] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT WHAT MY MAMA SAYS I AM. I'M NOT
[2:44:11] WHAT MY TEACHER SAYS I AM. I AM WHAT MY
[2:44:14] BOSS SAYS I AM. I'M NOT THE PASTOR SAYS
[2:44:17] I AM. I AM WHAT GOD SAYS I AM.
[2:44:22] I KNOW WHO I AM. I'M WALKING IN POWER.
[2:44:26] I'M WALKING IN MIRACLE. I LIVE A LIFE OF
[2:44:29] FAITH.
[2:44:31] You are.
[2:44:36] WHO ARE YOU? YOU ARE GOD.
[2:44:42] WE ARE AT THE WELL NOW. WE ARE AT THE
[2:44:45] WELL NOW. I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU TO SIT A
[2:44:48] LITTLE BECAUSE IT'S UNFAIR.
[2:44:52] IT'S UNFAIR. WHEN YOU ARE AT THE WELL,
[2:44:55] IT'S ACTION TIME. WHAT IS THE WELL? THE
[2:44:59] MEETING PLACE FOR WOMEN.
[2:45:02] THE WELL IS THE MEETING PLACE.
[2:45:07] WHEN JESUS WAS AT THE WELL, WHAT
[2:45:10] HAPPENED? HE MET THE WOMAN OF SAMARIA.
[2:45:17] THIS IS THE WELL OF UGANDA.
[2:45:20] THE WORLD
[2:45:22] OF UGANDA
[2:45:25] EVENING TIME
[2:45:27] EVENING TIME.
[2:45:29] &gt;&gt; WHEN MOSES
[2:45:31] &gt;&gt; WENT TO THE LAND OF MIDORA
[2:45:36] AT THE WELL
[2:45:39] HE WAS AT THE WELL.
[2:45:41] THAT'S WHERE HE GOT
[2:45:45] AMEN.
[2:45:48] HE ARRIVED.
[2:45:50] AT THE WELL. AND HERE WE ARE AT THE
[2:45:54] WELL.
[2:45:56] AND THERE WAS a prayer.
[2:46:00] AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN 30 MINUTES?
[2:46:03] THE ANGEL WAS TELLING ME WHEN YOU
[2:46:05] ARRIVE, FEED THE CAMELS,
[2:46:09] FEED THE CAMELS.
[2:46:13] SOMETHING
[2:46:15] ABOUT THE 30 MINUTES.
[2:46:17] BROTHER SAYS MOSES AT THE BACK SIDE OF
[2:46:20] THE DESERT.
[2:46:22] HE SAYS THE BUSH THAT WAS BURNING
[2:46:25] HAD been there BURNING
[2:46:28] FOR A SPACE OF ABOUT HALF AN HOUR.
[2:46:32] THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAYS MOSES SAID
[2:46:35] I WILL now turn.
[2:46:39] IT WAS BURNING FOR HOW MANY MINUTES?
[2:46:42] &gt;&gt; 30 MINUTES. AND BROTHER SAID WHEN I WENT
[2:46:46] FISHING
[2:46:47] WITH THE WOOD BROTHERS AND I FISHED OUT
[2:46:50] THAT LITTLE FISH AND THE INSIDE WENT UP.
[2:46:55] HE SAYS IT HAD BEEN LYING THERE ON THE
[2:46:57] BANK
[2:46:59] FOR A SPACE OF ABOUT
[2:47:02] HALF AN HOUR.
[2:47:04] I HAVE BEEN HERE PREACHING
[2:47:07] FOR OVER 30 MINUTES.
[2:47:09] AND WHEN BROTHER
[2:47:12] WHEN THE 30 MINUTES WAS OVER,
[2:47:14] HE SAID LITTLE VISION,
[2:47:17] I GIVE YOU LIFE. AND I'M TELLING YOU,
[2:47:20] IT'S OVER 30 MINUTES. IT'S RESURRECTION
[2:47:23] TIME.
[2:47:25] LITTLE SISTER,
[2:47:27] I GIVE YOU LIFE. LITTLE BROTHER, I GIVE
[2:47:32] YOU LIFE. IT'S RESURRECTION TIME. AND
[2:47:36] SAYS, WHEN YOU WENT TO FINLAND,
[2:47:39] THE BOYS THAT HAD BEEN STRUCK BY GOD,
[2:47:43] HE SAYS THEY HAD BEEN DEAD
[2:47:46] FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES. BUT AFTER 30
[2:47:49] MINUTES, IT'S RESURRECTION TIME.
[2:47:54] WHEN YOU OPEN THE SEVENTH SEAL,
[2:48:05] SILENCE
[2:48:07] SILENCE IS NOT HERE.
[2:48:09] THE SILENCE IS IN HEAVEN. WHY? HE IS NO
[2:48:12] LONGER IN HEAVEN. WHERE IS HE?
[2:48:22] DIFFERENT FROM YOUR PASTOR.
[2:48:24] MY MINISTRY IS DIFFERENT FROM YOUR
[2:48:26] TEACHER. MY MINISTRY TO DECLARE HIM.
[2:48:39] IS
[2:48:40] &gt;&gt; WHERE IN UGANDA. HE IS HERE
[2:48:44] &gt;&gt; IN YOUR LIFE. HE IS IN THIS PLACE.
[2:48:50] I WANT TO MAKE A DECLARATION.
[2:48:52] WE ARE NO LONGER IN A SCHOOL HALL.
[2:48:58] So there's a 10 LITER REVELATION.
[2:49:02] THE 10 LIT REVELATION
[2:49:05] IS DOING what you have been asked TO DO.
[2:49:09] SO THERE'S A 10 LIT skate
[2:49:13] and there is a 2,000 liter scale.
[2:49:18] One camel
[2:49:20] drinks 200 lit.
[2:49:23] 10 CAMELS
[2:49:25] DRINK 2,000 lit.
[2:49:29] A REQUIREMENT TO QUALIFY TO BE BRIDE
[2:49:33] WAS A 2,000 LITER REVELATION.
[2:49:37] BUT THE BEGINNING IS JUST A 10 LITER
[2:49:39] REVELATION.
[2:49:43] SO YOU CAN WEAR A 10 LIT SK.
[2:49:48] IT'S JUST BELOW THE KNEES
[2:49:55] 10.
[2:49:59] It's not a mini skirt. It's not also a
[2:50:03] long skate.
[2:50:04] &gt;&gt; It's a 10 LIT REVELATION.
[2:50:08] YOU CAN WEAR A 10 LIT TROUSER.
[2:50:13] It's not a short
[2:50:15] but it's not a trouser. IT'S A 10 LIT
[2:50:18] REVELATION.
[2:50:19] YOU CAN HAIRSTYLE.
[2:50:23] YOU HAVE NOT CUT YOUR HAIR,
[2:50:26] BUT YOU ARE NOT also keeping it the
[2:50:27] correct way. IT'S A 10 REVELATION.
[2:50:31] AND WE HAVE 10 LIT PREACHERS,
[2:50:35] 2,000 liter preachers,
[2:50:38] 2,000 lit preachers,
[2:50:42] WHO WOULD GO INTO THE OLD TESTAMENT,
[2:50:46] the Bible says,
[2:50:50] AND HE MET THE KING OF SALEM.
[2:50:54] AND HE GAVE TITHE OF ALL.
[2:50:57] BUT WHEN WRITES, HE SAYS, "AND THIS
[2:51:02] KING OF
[2:51:04] PRIEST OF THE MOST HIGH GOD ALSO KNOWN
[2:51:06] KING AS THE RIGHTEOUS
[2:51:10] made like unto THE SON OF GOD
[2:51:12] WITHOUT
[2:51:18] you getting THE DATA.
[2:51:21] IT'S NOT THERE, BUT IT'S A 2,000 LIT
[2:51:24] REVELATION. WHEN THE BIBLE IS WRITTEN IN
[2:51:26] THE OLD TESTAMENT,
[2:51:29] IT SAYS, "AND MOSES APPEARED BEFORE
[2:51:32] PHARAOH AND PHARAOH, THE MAGICIANS, AND
[2:51:37] THEY TOOK THEIR SNAKES
[2:51:41] AND THE ROAD OF AARON."
[2:51:45] AMEN.
[2:51:49] &gt;&gt; IT WAS NO LONGER THE ROAD OF MOSES.
[2:51:52] THE BIBLE SAYS THE ROAD OF AARON
[2:51:56] SWALLOWED THE SNAKE OF THE SORCERERS.
[2:52:01] In other words, THE ROD OF MOSES
[2:52:04] MUST BECOME THE ROD OF AARON.
[2:52:07] THE ROD OF THE PROPHET MUST BECOME THE
[2:52:10] ROAD OF THE FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY.
[2:52:12] WE HAVE
[2:52:15] the snake of Jambbury.
[2:52:19] WE HAVE IT. THE SNAKE OF UGANDA. WE HAVE
[2:52:22] IT.
[2:52:24] THERE'S NO THERE'S NO WISH
[2:52:27] THAT CAN BE WITH YOU. THE MESSAGE OF THE
[2:52:30] HOUR HAS SWALLOWED THEIR POWERS.
[2:52:38] WE ARE SWALLOWING
[2:52:40] THE POWERS OF UKAN.
[2:52:46] COME, LET ME BLESS YOU. WE ARE
[2:52:49] SWALLOWING
[2:52:51] THE SNAKES of Uganda.
[2:52:56] ARE YOU HEARING WHAT I'M SAYING? IF YOU
[2:53:02] AS THE PRIEST,
[2:53:04] &gt;&gt; THE THINGS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE, WE HAVE
[2:53:07] SWALLOWED IT.
[2:53:09] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS.
[2:53:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT WHEN PAUL WRITES, HE SAYS AS
[2:53:14] JANICE AND JUMB
[2:53:17] WITH MOSES,
[2:53:19] WHERE DO YOU get the data
[2:53:21] of saying their names was Janice and
[2:53:23] JUMB
[2:53:29] IN THIS DAY AND IT SAYS AND REBECCA
[2:53:34] THE WIFE OF ZAKIUS
[2:53:36] WAS PRAYING FOR A HUSBAND.
[2:53:39] THIS SCRIPTURE
[2:53:41] SAID THE WIFE OF JESUS
[2:53:43] WAS CALLED REBECCA AND THEY WERE
[2:53:46] STANDING IN HALLELUJAH STREET
[2:53:50] AT amen corner.
[2:53:53] BROTHER
[2:53:54] WE WILL TELL YOU THE NAME OF THE WIFE OF
[2:53:58] ZAKIUS. BROTHER WE WILL TELL YOU THE
[2:54:02] NAME OF THE FRIEND CLEOPUS.
[2:54:06] HE SAYS CLEOPAS AND HIS FRIEND
[2:54:09] WE'RE GOING TO A MOUSE AND HE COMES IN
[2:54:12] ANOTHER SPOKEN WORD.
[2:54:16] NOW YOU KNOW THE FRIEND OF CLEOPUS
[2:54:19] ISOP
[2:54:21] WHERE ARE YOU GETTING THIS
[2:54:23] 2000 LITTLE REVELATION BROTHER WILL COME
[2:54:27] AND SAY IT WAS ON A TUESDAY MORNING
[2:54:30] AROUND 11:00
[2:54:33] ON UNDER THE HOT DESERT SUN
[2:54:36] THAT MEC
[2:54:39] CAME DOWN AND VISITED ABRAHAM.
[2:54:43] HOW ARE YOU GETTING THE TIME?
[2:54:46] HE'S SEEING IT FROM A 2,000 LITER
[2:54:50] REVELATION.
[2:54:51] SO WHAT DID REBECCA DO? SHE DID THE
[2:54:55] EXTRA
[2:54:57] WHICH WAS NOT REQUIRED. IT WAS NOT ASKED
[2:55:00] OF HER BUT IT IS WHAT QUALIFIED YOU
[2:55:04] QUALIFIES THE BRIDE. WHAT QUALIFIES YOU
[2:55:08] IS GOING AN EXTRA MILE. SO WHAT DO YOU
[2:55:11] NEED TO DO TONIGHT AS A
[2:55:13] FEED THE CAMELS.
[2:55:16] FEED THE CAMELS.
[2:55:18] THE WATERS OF REBECCA
[2:55:20] ARE DANGEROUS WATERS. WHEN SHE HAD DONE
[2:55:23] FEEDING THE CAMELS,
[2:55:27] THE CAMELS WERE NOW REBECCA'S COMING.
[2:55:34] WHEN YOU SAY AMEN,
[2:55:36] THE PROMISE
[2:55:38] BECOMES YOUR PROMISE.
[2:55:40] FEED THE CAMELS.
[2:55:44] REBECCA,
[2:55:46] &gt;&gt; WHEN SHE WENT TO THE WELL, SHE WAS
[2:55:49] WALKING.
[2:55:50] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN SHE CAME FROM THE WELL, SHE WAS
[2:55:53] NO LONGER WALKING. SHE WAS RIDING. SHE
[2:55:56] WAS WRITING. YOU MIGHT HAVE COME HERE.
[2:56:00] YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN HERE WALKING, BUT
[2:56:04] YOU ARE NO LONGER GOING BACK
[2:56:06] WALKING. YOU MIGHT HAVE COME HERE.
[2:56:09] WITHOUT A JOB. YOU'RE NO LONGER GOING
[2:56:11] BACK WITHOUT A JOB. YOU MIGHT HAVE COME
[2:56:15] HERE.
[2:56:17] YOU'RE NOT GOING BACK.
[2:56:21] WHY FEED THE CAMEL?
[2:56:24] FEED THE CAMEL.
[2:56:27] THE CAMEL'S
[2:56:29] MOM ASKED, "WHOSE CAMELS ARE THIS?"
[2:56:35] &gt;&gt; MY CAMELS.
[2:56:37] &gt;&gt; MY CAMELS.
[2:56:39] ONE OF THESE DAYS, YOU WILL SHOCK THE
[2:56:42] WHOLE VILLAGE.
[2:56:47] IF IT DOESN'T SHOCK THEM,
[2:56:50] IF IT DOESN'T SHOCK THEM, THEN GOD HAS
[2:56:53] NOT DONE IT. IF GOD DOES IT, YOU SHALL
[2:56:57] SHOCK THEM. YOU SAY, "IS THIS YOU?
[2:57:01] IS THIS YOU WITH A RANGE ROVER?"
[2:57:06] UH-HUH.
[2:57:09] IS THIS YOU THAT IS MARRIED NOW?
[2:57:15] IS THIS YOU WHO IS DEDICATING TWINS?
[2:57:22] &gt;&gt; THE BROTHER WHO COME HOLDING HIS OWN,
[2:57:25] THE SISTER WHO COME HOLDING HER OWN.
[2:57:28] TWINS
[2:57:30] FOR THE TIME THAT YOU WERE WAITING FOR.
[2:57:33] BLESSING MUST COME.
[2:57:37] HALLELUJAH.
[2:57:42] There was a man by the name of John
[2:57:44] Ryan. He was blind and he came in the
[2:57:47] prayer line. He was prayed for said, "Do
[2:57:51] you believe?" He says he believed. He
[2:57:54] says, "Receive your sight." He went
[2:57:56] back. HE WAS STILL BLIND. AND THEN his
[2:57:59] friend SAID, "YOU WERE LYING.
[2:58:02] HE LIED TO YOU OR BACK IN THE PRAYER
[2:58:04] LINE. HE CAME AGAIN. HE SAID, "BROTHER,
[2:58:08] BROTHER, I remember you. I prayed for
[2:58:10] you." He says, "They told me that you
[2:58:13] lied to me." My brother says, "Did you
[2:58:17] said you believe?
[2:58:19] Did you tell them when I did you have
[2:58:21] faith? You said you have." He says, "I
[2:58:25] believe it." My brother says, "Do you
[2:58:26] want new prayer or should you believe
[2:58:30] the old prayer?
[2:58:34] WHAT SHOULD I DO THEN? BROTHER SAYS, "GO
[2:58:37] BACK. GO TESTIFY.

[2:59:06] AND HE SAYS EXTRA EXTRA
[2:59:08] I AM HEALED
[2:59:10] AND I AM DELIVERED.
[2:59:16] I am many people.

[2:59:24] going in the rapture.
[2:59:34] WE I KNOW OUR TIME IS OVER.
[2:59:37] THIS IS EXTRA TIME.

[3:01:21] SO, SO HE HAD THE TOWEL.
[3:01:24] &gt;&gt; HE'S BEEN CUT. DON'T WORRY. ALL THINGS
[3:01:27] ARE UNDER CONTROL.
[3:01:29] HE'S BEING CUT.
[3:01:32] HE SAYS,
[3:01:34] "I CAN SEE.
[3:01:37] THE EYES OPEN." HE SAID, "I
[3:01:41] CAN SEE.

[3:02:26] LIKE IT UNTIL YOU BECOME IT.
[3:02:31] WAS NO LONGER ACTING.
[3:02:34] HE RAN WITH THE POWER.
[3:02:37] I
[3:02:40] SAID TO FOLLOW HIM, PLEASE
