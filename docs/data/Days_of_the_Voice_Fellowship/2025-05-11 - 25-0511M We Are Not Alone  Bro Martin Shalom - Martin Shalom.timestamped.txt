[1:48:25] disorganize me.
[1:48:29] I request the people those are working
[1:48:32] the sound to increase my
[1:48:35] sound. After I was done with the
[1:48:37] work and when I was coming I realized my
[1:48:41] iPad was
[1:48:45] missing and yet I was very
[1:48:48] far. So I thought of going
[1:48:51] back and coming.
[1:48:54] I needed to use it this morning.
[1:48:58] I was not sure where it
[1:48:59] was because I had it when I was leaving
[1:49:04] work and I happened to use like two
[1:49:06] borders.
[1:49:10] So I was not sure but at least the one
[1:49:12] uh the one the second
[1:49:15] one when I was coming my mind told that
[1:49:17] something was
[1:49:20] missing checked my phone I
[1:49:23] had other tools I use for I had
[1:49:27] them then after I had traveled some good
[1:49:32] kilometers maybe like
[1:49:35] 20 I realized it was not
[1:49:40] Praise be to God. But my heart was
[1:49:44] firm because my iPad has a lot of
[1:49:49] things. Has my
[1:49:51] quotation, my work and other things like
[1:49:53] that. My
[1:49:55] sermons and getting a single sermon is
[1:49:59] not
[1:50:01] easy. So I was telling God, what am I
[1:50:03] going
[1:50:05] through? But I just believed
[1:50:07] God said let me go back. I went to the
[1:50:11] mobile money point where I where where I
[1:50:13] carried some
[1:50:15] transaction and the told me I not the
[1:50:18] thing was not
[1:50:19] there. So what I went to the I went to
[1:50:22] police and I reported uh the I reported
[1:50:26] the case of losing my
[1:50:30] property because that's always the first
[1:50:33] step. So they asked me the
[1:50:37] suspect. Indeed, there was someone I was
[1:50:41] suspecting. That was the first border
[1:50:43] border
[1:50:45] guy. But I did not enclose the name to
[1:50:48] the
[1:50:50] police. I told them that I first want if
[1:50:53] it happened that he's the one with I
[1:50:54] want first give him a
[1:50:58] chance. So I went to the community radio
[1:51:00] near that place. They don't have
[1:51:04] I wanted to pay for an announcement.
[1:51:09] Yeah, that's how important my iPad is.
[1:51:13] So when I was still
[1:51:15] there, then I saw a missed
[1:51:18] call from the guy I was working, the one
[1:51:21] was helping
[1:51:23] me. Uh so I called back before I paid
[1:51:26] the money. He told me, "Hey, by the way,
[1:51:29] you forgot your thing here.
[1:51:33] It's really costed me a lot of money.
[1:51:37] Yeah, because I used board. I was trying
[1:51:39] to beat catch up with time and come have
[1:51:41] some
[1:51:42] time. But I thank God that I have
[1:51:47] it. Amen. Praise be to God. So this
[1:51:51] morning I spend a night here
[1:51:55] praying. I was waiting on God, asking
[1:51:58] God, what can I do?
[1:52:01] What can I speak
[1:52:02] about? Praise be to
[1:52:05] God. But as I was
[1:52:07] praying, I just heard like the Holy
[1:52:10] Spirit whispering to
[1:52:13] me that we are not
[1:52:16] alone. Praise be to
[1:52:19] God. And that was that settled
[1:52:23] it. Praise be to God. I don't know what
[1:52:26] you're going through. I don't know the
[1:52:28] challenges you're facing.
[1:52:30] We don't know what we are
[1:52:33] facing. Amen. But one thing I'm sure
[1:52:36] of, we are not alone. And I believe God
[1:52:42] has a
[1:52:43] reason why he brought that
[1:52:46] message. Praise be to God. Amen. Just
[1:52:51] give me your undivided
[1:52:53] attention and I trust the Lord will
[1:52:56] speak to
[1:52:57] you. And where we have read, we are
[1:53:00] seeing uh the birth of Moses.
[1:53:03] [Music]
[1:53:05] Praise be to God. Moses was a
[1:53:08] prophet. And we are seeing how we uh
[1:53:11] we've read many time how God used
[1:53:14] him. And we know the story how they went
[1:53:17] in
[1:53:19] bondage, how they suffered
[1:53:21] there. Praise be to God. And you know it
[1:53:25] goes way back. It started with Joseph.
[1:53:29] Amen. And we shall speak a little bit
[1:53:32] about
[1:53:33] Joseph and we and we shall see how God
[1:53:36] protected
[1:53:38] Joseph. Praise be to God. Remember there
[1:53:43] is a mark of high
[1:53:45] calling and that is so important to us
[1:53:47] as
[1:53:49] Christians. And when apostle Paul
[1:53:52] says that laying aside we are supposed
[1:53:55] to lay aside everywhere.
[1:53:58] Amen. Every sin that was easily be set
[1:54:02] up and let us run toward that
[1:54:07] mark. Praise be to God. There is a mark
[1:54:11] of our
[1:54:12] calling that we are aiming
[1:54:15] at and whatever we are
[1:54:17] doing, no matter what we are going
[1:54:20] through, the challenges we are
[1:54:22] facing, we should focus our eyes onto
[1:54:25] Jesus.
[1:54:27] Jesus is that man.
[1:54:30] And as long as we are looking unto
[1:54:33] Jesus, we will never go
[1:54:35] wrong because he's the one leading the
[1:54:39] way. Praise be to
[1:54:42] God. Amen. When God met
[1:54:46] Moses and gave him the gave him
[1:54:49] commission to go and liberate
[1:54:52] Israel, he gave Abraham the promise.
[1:54:56] of the promised
[1:54:57] land. And Moses went with that
[1:55:01] message. Praise be to God. He was to
[1:55:04] liberate them from
[1:55:06] Egypt and take them the promised
[1:55:08] land. And we can say the mark of calling
[1:55:12] that
[1:55:14] time. It was the promised
[1:55:17] land. It wasn't the
[1:55:19] wilderness. It wasn't the Red
[1:55:22] Sea. Amen. It wasn't the
[1:55:26] Amalachites. Praise be to
[1:55:28] God. Amen. So when God met
[1:55:32] them, he only gave them one
[1:55:35] promise and that is the promised
[1:55:39] land. Amen. God never spoke about the
[1:55:41] Red
[1:55:43] Sea. No sir. He never spoke about the
[1:55:47] mountain. He never spoke about the
[1:55:49] wilderness.
[1:55:51] They were not supposed even to suffer in
[1:55:53] the
[1:55:55] wilderness as long as they had focused
[1:55:58] their eyes on
[1:56:00] God. Suffering
[1:56:02] came after they med against
[1:56:05] God and against
[1:56:08] Moses. Praise be to God. That is the way
[1:56:11] it was in the
[1:56:13] beginning. The prophet tells us that in
[1:56:16] the beginning when God created the
[1:56:19] world,
[1:56:20] when he created
[1:56:22] everything, everything was perfect.
[1:56:26] Amen. And he goes ahead and tells us how
[1:56:29] Adam named the
[1:56:32] animals, how he could call the
[1:56:35] lion and maybe use it as a
[1:56:39] pillow. Praise be to
[1:56:41] God. Worms had know that that kind of
[1:56:46] things.
[1:56:50] Amen. Trees had no
[1:56:53] thorns. Amen. Animals were not
[1:56:58] violent, they were
[1:57:01] friendly because sin had not come into
[1:57:03] the
[1:57:04] world. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:57:07] But when man sinned against God, when
[1:57:10] man rebel against the word of
[1:57:13] God,
[1:57:16] sin, everything went into
[1:57:19] mess. Blessed be the name of the
[1:57:22] Lord. And from that time up to
[1:57:27] today, we are seeing
[1:57:32] anity. Animals are using their own for
[1:57:34] protection.
[1:57:38] And you realize man is the most
[1:57:40] dangerous
[1:57:43] animal. They fear
[1:57:46] you than even
[1:57:51] lion. We fear one another than even
[1:57:56] lion. Praise be to God. That's why
[1:57:59] someone will construct a
[1:58:01] house. He will put balance.
[1:58:04] He will put like three layers of
[1:58:07] windows. Then he will build a perimeter
[1:58:09] wall of
[1:58:11] 99. Then you put rest on top of it. You
[1:58:16] put electric on
[1:58:19] top. He'll put a
[1:58:21] camera. As if that is not enough, he
[1:58:24] will give a one of 360. The one which
[1:58:27] can rotate and monitor the whole
[1:58:31] place. Some put laser beam.
[1:58:34] motion
[1:58:35] sensors, alarms and security guards. And
[1:58:40] on top of that, they even have their
[1:58:45] guns. That is not to protect
[1:58:48] themselves against
[1:58:50] lion or buffalo, but against their
[1:58:54] fellow
[1:58:56] man. Praise be to God. There is the
[1:58:59] stress in the world.
[1:59:02] But there is a group of people in this
[1:59:04] earth, hallelujah, whose guns are
[1:59:08] invisible, whose weapons are
[1:59:11] invisible. And they are the most secured
[1:59:13] people on
[1:59:15] earth. Hallelujah. Men who are guarded
[1:59:18] by
[1:59:20] angels. Praise be to God. Hallelujah.
[1:59:23] Amen. Men who can turn the world upside
[1:59:27] down. One man called Elishah.
[1:59:31] Elijah one day when the king troubled
[1:59:35] Israel and he met the king he told him
[1:59:39] praise be to God from this day hence for
[1:59:43] we will never have even a drop of rain
[1:59:46] not even
[1:59:48] a mere
[1:59:51] word spoken
[1:59:54] word praise be to God and I believe that
[1:59:57] was the revealed word of that hour
[2:00:01] when he spoke the
[2:00:03] word maybe maybe the
[2:00:06] king he just laughed at
[2:00:08] him you saw
[2:00:11] Elijah sometime you're old so you go
[2:00:15] extreme how can that happen so now you
[2:00:19] becoming a
[2:00:21] god you're even commanding them not to
[2:00:27] rain be serious
[2:00:32] Praise be to
[2:00:33] God. Let me tell
[2:00:35] you, God always work in
[2:00:40] simplicity. That's why message
[2:00:43] believers, they don't box the
[2:00:46] demons. We've seen
[2:00:48] people praying for someone who's
[2:00:51] possessed. You find there's love on
[2:00:54] them, speak
[2:00:57] them for as we speak.
[2:01:00] [Music]
[2:01:02] Amen. We
[2:01:04] declare and we decree.
[2:01:07] Hallelujah. Amen. And it
[2:01:10] happens. Blessed be the name of the
[2:01:13] Lord.
[2:01:14] Amen. So I'm here to tell you this
[2:01:17] morning that brethren, we are not alone.
[2:01:22] We have God who created heavens and
[2:01:25] earth. But most times we remove our eyes
[2:01:29] from
[2:01:29] God and we look at the situation in
[2:01:32] front of
[2:01:33] us. We look at the condition around
[2:01:36] us. But this morning I want us to see
[2:01:40] things from different
[2:01:44] perspective. Amen. The way God want us
[2:01:47] to see it.
[2:01:50] Hallelujah.
[2:01:54] David one time says, "I was young, but
[2:01:58] now I'm old, but I have never seen a
[2:02:02] righteous
[2:02:05] forsaken." No, no. He said begging for
[2:02:09] bread. Amen. I believe David was
[2:02:12] speaking
[2:02:13] that when he was of
[2:02:16] age that God had never disappointed
[2:02:20] him all through his
[2:02:23] lifetime even when he sinned. God never
[2:02:28] disappointed. And here the man is giving
[2:02:30] a testimony. He say I was young but now
[2:02:35] I'm old but I have never
[2:02:37] seen righteous forsaken.
[2:02:42] Amen. God cannot forsake his
[2:02:45] own. We are part of God. And without
[2:02:50] you, God is not
[2:02:52] complete. Without you, brother, sister,
[2:02:55] Jesus is not
[2:02:58] complete. Let that sink in your heart.
[2:03:01] That without you, in your weak
[2:03:05] condition, in your need state, in your
[2:03:08] sick condition,
[2:03:10] God is not complete without you. For the
[2:03:14] Bible says we are the
[2:03:16] members of his
[2:03:19] body. Praise be to God. And remember God
[2:03:23] is
[2:03:26] perfect. So without
[2:03:28] you it means meeting is missing some
[2:03:35] part and we cannot believe in that God.
[2:03:39] when he comes and say now I'm God
[2:03:41] putting on
[2:03:42] flesh and is with one
[2:03:46] ears you will not accept
[2:03:49] that praise be to God but is a
[2:03:52] supernatural God.
[2:03:55] Praise be to
[2:03:56] God.
[2:03:58] Amen. Praise the
[2:04:01] Lord. Let us you go with me to Jeremiah
[2:04:04] chapter 29.
[2:04:05] [Music]
[2:04:08] vers
[2:04:16] 11. The longer I
[2:04:23] [Music]
[2:04:24] read, I know the thought I have toward
[2:04:28] you, says the
[2:04:30] Lord. The thought of
[2:04:33] peace, not bad thought.
[2:04:38] to give you
[2:04:41] hope to give unexpected hope. Blessed be
[2:04:45] the name of the Lord. Are you seeing the
[2:04:47] thought God has toward
[2:04:50] you that stamps the other
[2:04:54] one that we are not
[2:04:57] alone. God will bring
[2:05:00] us to an expected end.
[2:05:04] God has an image in his
[2:05:07] mind. He has a masterpiece in his mind
[2:05:10] and whatever he's doing is driving us
[2:05:14] toward
[2:05:15] that. Praise be to God. You will have
[2:05:19] hinderances alongside the
[2:05:21] way. Challenges will
[2:05:23] come. Sickness will strike your home.
[2:05:27] But all those things they are driving
[2:05:31] you toward unexpected
[2:05:35] end. Praise be to God. There is nothing
[2:05:39] that can stop
[2:05:41] that. There are not enough demons in
[2:05:43] hell that can stop that brother sister.
[2:05:47] Whatever comes our
[2:05:49] way it is a push toward
[2:05:54] that. Amen. How many have ever seen
[2:05:59] someone who knocks
[2:06:02] himself and falls
[2:06:06] behind? Praise be to
[2:06:10] God. When you're
[2:06:12] walking and knock
[2:06:15] away, you just go
[2:06:18] forward like three steps. Praise be to
[2:06:21] God.
[2:06:22] Amen. But most times when we hit on a
[2:06:25] stone,
[2:06:27] We complain about our
[2:06:33] toes and we forget the three steps
[2:06:37] ahead. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:06:40] Now whatever the devil is bringing our
[2:06:43] way. It is to push us
[2:06:46] forward, not to go
[2:06:48] backward. That is the working of
[2:06:51] God. Amen. God is a mathematician.
[2:06:56] There is no equation which God cannot
[2:07:00] solve. When the devil want to hurt our
[2:07:04] toys, God gives us three step ahead of
[2:07:07] the
[2:07:08] devil. Praise be to God. That's why
[2:07:11] Apostle Paul say all things work
[2:07:14] together for good for them who love God
[2:07:19] and for his purpose.
[2:07:22] Praise the Lord.
[2:07:25] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But many
[2:07:28] times we are looking at our
[2:07:31] failures. We are looking at the
[2:07:36] anarchs. Blessed be the name of the
[2:07:38] Lord. And he forget to look at the
[2:07:42] promise. We know that we are not
[2:07:45] alone. Hallelujah. Amen. That's why
[2:07:48] Jesus told us to pray every day. Pray
[2:07:52] without ceasing. Because when we pray,
[2:07:56] we shall know the will of God. When we
[2:07:58] pray, we shall get the direction of God.
[2:08:02] When we pray, the devil will give
[2:08:07] way. Amen. Blessed be the name of the
[2:08:10] Lord. He says, "Our Father in
[2:08:13] heaven, hallowed be thy name."
[2:08:16] First of all, here you have to recognize
[2:08:20] that you have a father in heaven. You
[2:08:23] don't have a father in state house. You
[2:08:25] don't have a father at home, brother.
[2:08:28] It's not a father in the
[2:08:29] supermarket. There is a father in
[2:08:32] heaven.
[2:08:34] Hallelujah. Where angels are, where
[2:08:37] holiness comes from, where the fountain
[2:08:40] of healing is, where is. And when you
[2:08:44] have recognized that, that my father
[2:08:46] sits in
[2:08:48] heaven and you are just like your
[2:08:51] father. Your father is holy. Your father
[2:08:54] is righteous. Your father is powerful.
[2:08:58] Your father is able. Your father is
[2:09:01] rich. Your father is mighty. He has
[2:09:04] control over the
[2:09:06] nature. Control over your
[2:09:08] body. Amen. And he sits in heaven.
[2:09:14] Hallowed be thy
[2:09:16] name. Thy kingdom
[2:09:18] come. And what is the kingdom? The
[2:09:22] prophet tells us, the kingdom of God is
[2:09:25] the Holy Ghost. Praise be to God. Let
[2:09:29] the Holy Ghost
[2:09:31] come. Amen. And when the Holy Ghost will
[2:09:34] come, his will be will be done because
[2:09:38] the Holy Ghost will do the will of the
[2:09:41] father.
[2:09:43] Praise be to God. So God is
[2:09:46] thing the way God works or the way he
[2:09:50] operates. Everything is
[2:09:54] citulated. Praise be to God. You cannot
[2:09:57] do the will of the
[2:09:58] father without the holy spirit in you.
[2:10:02] But when the holy ghost comes in you
[2:10:06] automatically he will do the will of the
[2:10:08] father.
[2:10:11] We always refer the Holy
[2:10:13] Ghost like as an example of a
[2:10:16] magnet. When the magnet is in you, he
[2:10:20] will only pull the things which has
[2:10:23] magnetism in
[2:10:25] them. He will never pull a
[2:10:27] plastic. So when the Holy Ghost is in
[2:10:30] you, he will only attract the things of
[2:10:32] God in you. He will never attract the
[2:10:35] things of the world.
[2:10:38] Praise be to God. That's why we need the
[2:10:40] Holy Ghost. That's why every believer
[2:10:43] need the Holy Ghost. Every mother need
[2:10:45] the Holy Ghost. Every minister need the
[2:10:48] Holy Ghost. Every believer need the Holy
[2:10:53] Ghost. Yes sir. When the Holy Ghost
[2:10:56] comes in us, blessed be the name of the
[2:10:59] Lord. There you can walk and say, "I am
[2:11:03] not alone." When the Holy Ghost comes in
[2:11:06] you, these are the things going to to
[2:11:10] attract. He will pull healing. He will
[2:11:13] attract deliverance. He will attract
[2:11:16] joy. The Holy Ghost brings you
[2:11:20] happiness,
[2:11:22] godliness, patience,
[2:11:25] deliverance, gifts, prophecy, tongues,
[2:11:30] interpretation.
[2:11:32] That's why we need the Holy
[2:11:35] Ghost. Yes sir. That is a sign that we
[2:11:40] are not alone.
[2:11:42] Praise be to God.
[2:11:45] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I will show I
[2:11:48] will give you an example as we
[2:11:50] move and we see men who had challenges
[2:11:52] in their
[2:11:53] life but they never walked alone and the
[2:11:57] challenges they had drove them.
[2:12:00] Hallelujah. Amen. It drove them to God
[2:12:03] toward God. We read about Moses.
[2:12:07] Hallelujah. When he was born,
[2:12:12] the mother never
[2:12:15] said. But I see this child is
[2:12:21] notorious. The way he looks the eyes, he
[2:12:24] looks the eyes, brother. The way
[2:12:29] the way he turns the eyes,
[2:12:33] it doesn't seem right.
[2:12:36] Probably you have not got any child. Not
[2:12:39] Moses's
[2:12:40] mother. Moses's mother
[2:12:43] knew. I prayed for this
[2:12:46] baby before he was conceived. I prayed
[2:12:50] for him when she was in the womb. And
[2:12:54] I'm praying for
[2:12:55] him at at the place of
[2:12:58] birth. Amen. The guy was already
[2:13:02] anointed.
[2:13:04] Praise be to God. He already attracted
[2:13:07] God. She attracted the Holy Ghost. And
[2:13:11] the Holy Spirit was with
[2:13:13] Moses. And when Moses was born, he was
[2:13:16] born a peculiar
[2:13:18] boy. Hallelujah. Those are the things
[2:13:22] done by the Holy
[2:13:23] Ghost. The Holy Ghost comes in your
[2:13:26] life, you will be a peculiar
[2:13:29] brother. You will be a peculiar
[2:13:32] sister. Hallelujah. That's what the Holy
[2:13:35] Ghost will
[2:13:38] do. Yes sir. You will not be the one who
[2:13:41] brings joke every time.
[2:13:44] Every time you you become a
[2:13:47] comedian, you find people you you've
[2:13:50] gathered the
[2:13:52] brethren and you find them
[2:13:54] laughing and maybe you think, "Hey,
[2:13:56] maybe uh maybe the P of God is moving
[2:14:01] their reach there, you see a brother
[2:14:04] showing them
[2:14:07] cartoon, receive the Holy Ghost.
[2:14:13] Praise be to
[2:14:14] God and you will never be
[2:14:17] alone. Either you love God or devil in
[2:14:21] your
[2:14:22] soul. You have to choose
[2:14:25] one. But this morning, I'm speaking to
[2:14:29] those who are walking with
[2:14:31] God.
[2:14:33] Hallelujah. There is one man in the
[2:14:35] Bible. This man walked with God. He
[2:14:39] lived for so many years.
[2:14:41] Hallelujah. Amen. The years of playing
[2:14:44] playing around.
[2:14:46] The Bible does not tell us that from
[2:14:49] Anoa's
[2:14:52] birth, he walked with
[2:14:55] God. But the Bible tells us. Hallelujah.
[2:14:59] After he reached a certain
[2:15:02] age, he gives us his
[2:15:04] geology. He was the seventh from Adam.
[2:15:08] Then he he begot sons and he begot
[2:15:11] sons and from there this one got this
[2:15:14] one and he live for this year.
[2:15:18] Hallelujah. And he walked with
[2:15:23] God. Praise be to God.
[2:15:26] Last Sunday we were told, we were told
[2:15:30] here, there are things which
[2:15:33] happen, things we go through when when
[2:15:36] we undergoing the
[2:15:38] growth it is
[2:15:40] natural. Praise be to God. But there
[2:15:43] must come a
[2:15:45] time where they say and brother Martin
[2:15:49] walked with
[2:15:50] God. Hallelujah. The man of 10 years ago
[2:15:55] is not the one of today. The one of
[2:15:58] today, he thinks
[2:16:01] different. He's
[2:16:03] careful. He knows where he's
[2:16:06] going. Hallelujah. Amen. But the one of
[2:16:09] 10 years
[2:16:10] ago, he used to play
[2:16:12] around, kiding around, kissing, teasing
[2:16:17] around. Praise be to God. But thanks be
[2:16:21] to
[2:16:21] God. Up to today, I'm still look at the
[2:16:25] mark of my
[2:16:26] God. Hallelujah. Amen. I have been
[2:16:29] beaten many
[2:16:31] times. I've been cast down many times,
[2:16:34] but I have never said, "God, I'm giving
[2:16:38] up. I have never cast God in my
[2:16:41] life. I've gone through
[2:16:44] challenges. I've gone through
[2:16:46] pain." Hallelujah. Amen. But despite the
[2:16:51] fact that all those things have
[2:16:54] happened, I am still moving on. It is
[2:16:58] not me moving on. Hallelujah. But there
[2:17:01] is someone walking with me. There is
[2:17:04] someone holding my
[2:17:06] hand. Praise be to God. I'm not walking
[2:17:09] alone. If if I was walking alone, I
[2:17:13] would have given up long time ago.
[2:17:18] Maybe at this time I would have been in
[2:17:19] a
[2:17:21] bar telling
[2:17:23] bartender had me
[2:17:29] on. Maybe I will not be married to a
[2:17:32] beautiful wife like my
[2:17:37] wife. Praise be to God. May we not be
[2:17:40] having beautiful flowers like I have.
[2:17:45] But all those are the
[2:17:47] benefit of not walking
[2:17:50] alone.
[2:17:52] Hallelujah. When God gives your
[2:17:55] wife, he gives you even
[2:17:59] [Music]
[2:18:01] overdose with all the
[2:18:04] nutrients. But don't forget, even when
[2:18:08] you're enjoying uh
[2:18:11] chicken, there is a bone somewhere.
[2:18:14] But even that bone is part of the
[2:18:19] chicken. Praise be to God. And what are
[2:18:22] those bones in
[2:18:25] sisters? There are some things that you
[2:18:27] just have to
[2:18:30] overlook and then you move
[2:18:33] on. Praise be to God. After all, if you
[2:18:37] get a
[2:18:39] chicken and you you remove all the bones
[2:18:41] from the all the bones from the what?
[2:18:44] How do they call it? From the
[2:18:48] meat, put them in the
[2:18:51] kilogram. Put them on a weighing
[2:18:53] scale and you you realize you have 10 kg
[2:18:58] of
[2:18:59] meat and a quart of bones.
[2:19:03] So those are not a big
[2:19:07] deal. Praise be to
[2:19:09] God. But when you are walking alone
[2:19:12] brother, the Bible says the way of
[2:19:16] transgressor is very
[2:19:19] hard. Yes
[2:19:23] sir. I remember one time uh one time
[2:19:26] pastoron was
[2:19:28] preaching and he was preaching about
[2:19:30] when someone is cast.
[2:19:33] Say when you are casting the
[2:19:35] city, Deuteronomy
[2:19:37] 28, they even cast in the village. But
[2:19:41] when you are cast in the village and
[2:19:43] maybe you are going to the city
[2:19:45] now, the c will enter the bus
[2:19:49] first and even the chicken they have
[2:19:51] given you in the
[2:19:53] village. But when you reach in the
[2:19:55] city,
[2:19:59] please let us cut and eat. That that
[2:20:02] chicken by the time you come out of the
[2:20:05] bus, you find when it was it was
[2:20:08] suffocated and even dead in the
[2:20:12] past because overtook
[2:20:16] you
[2:20:18] fast. Praise be to. Amen.
[2:20:23] And before you reach someone who's going
[2:20:24] to receive
[2:20:26] you, maybe you're like me who comes from
[2:20:28] the
[2:20:30] east and before you
[2:20:33] reach, the person gives you a
[2:20:37] call. Oh brother, I'm
[2:20:39] sorry. I've got a lot of
[2:20:42] problem. I will not be be able to have
[2:20:45] you at my place.
[2:20:47] I will let you know when
[2:20:51] things praise be to
[2:20:53] God. That's the danger of walking
[2:20:57] alone. That's why people hang
[2:21:01] themselves. The devil magnifies their
[2:21:04] problems and make them think that
[2:21:08] they're the only people suffering on
[2:21:10] earth. But before you think of your
[2:21:14] suffering, before you think of your
[2:21:17] trouble, I will offer you free
[2:21:21] transport and I will take you uh I'm
[2:21:24] talking of the person who thinks like
[2:21:28] that and we go visit the cancer
[2:21:31] institute.
[2:21:37] You'll
[2:21:38] realize you are the most health person
[2:21:40] on
[2:21:43] earth. One day I was very
[2:21:46] sick. I'm one person I think by the
[2:21:49] grace of
[2:21:52] God going to
[2:21:55] hospital maybe now that I think I'm now
[2:21:58] growing.
[2:22:01] I'm blessed the name of the Lord. And
[2:22:03] one day I went to the
[2:22:06] hospital and just something came in my
[2:22:10] mind to go and to some
[2:22:15] words. Brethren I want to tell
[2:22:19] you within just no
[2:22:23] minutes I was
[2:22:25] healed. I told
[2:22:27] God I am very
[2:22:29] fine. These are the
[2:22:33] sick just moved
[2:22:37] home. Praise be to
[2:22:39] God. We are not walking
[2:22:43] alone. We have a
[2:22:46] God. And this God is not just leading us
[2:22:51] anyhow. No sir. We are meandering in the
[2:22:55] wilderness. We are wandering in the
[2:22:57] wilderness.
[2:23:02] Because of our
[2:23:04] unbelief, this God knows where he's
[2:23:06] taking
[2:23:07] us. He has unexpected
[2:23:11] end. He has a thought of
[2:23:14] peace, not of
[2:23:16] suffering, not of pain. The pain we have
[2:23:20] today in our
[2:23:21] bodies. The trouble we are going in. The
[2:23:25] trouble sea we are sailing
[2:23:28] into it is just pushing us toward the
[2:23:31] the will of
[2:23:34] God. Praise be to God. You are not
[2:23:39] alone. You will never be
[2:23:41] alone. Even when you have trouble at
[2:23:44] work, you just you have a bad day.
[2:23:49] You have a friend. You have your big
[2:23:52] brother. You have your
[2:23:54] sister. You are
[2:23:59] undisputed.
[2:24:02] Amen. Praise be to God. Just keep
[2:24:06] pressing
[2:24:08] on. Tell the
[2:24:10] devil turn that
[2:24:13] circumstance into a
[2:24:15] blessing. Blessed be the name of the
[2:24:17] Lord.
[2:24:19] Hallelujah. Amen. Tells us in the
[2:24:23] message as the ego
[2:24:25] stareth that in the eyes of the
[2:24:28] storm that's where the ego
[2:24:34] go few days two days
[2:24:37] ago I was laying a drainage system.
[2:24:49] So and also I was doing some maintenance
[2:24:52] of others which had some
[2:24:56] damages. There is something that I saw
[2:24:59] and it was so
[2:25:01] amazing. I went on the one on the last
[2:25:04] money
[2:25:06] hall man. These are the these are where
[2:25:09] the the two pipe are joined.
[2:25:21] So when we poured water
[2:25:23] there, I know that there are some
[2:25:25] rats living in those
[2:25:30] pipes and water was going toward the
[2:25:34] west and the end game of that
[2:25:39] pipe, it goes into the septic tank.
[2:25:43] [Music]
[2:25:45] Amen.
[2:25:47] So this thing tried to
[2:25:50] run but I think it
[2:25:52] realized by
[2:25:55] instinct maybe it used to to when the
[2:25:58] pipe was
[2:26:00] dry up to the
[2:26:03] end and the pip reaches
[2:26:09] here and this is a very a deep kind of
[2:26:14] septic of over 14 ft.
[2:26:16] [Music]
[2:26:18] So when the thing saw that the water was
[2:26:21] much, I was so
[2:26:25] shocked it decided to run toward the
[2:26:28] side where the direction where the water
[2:26:29] is coming
[2:26:32] from and the thing
[2:26:38] maneuvered. Praise be to
[2:26:42] God. That's why there is a saying
[2:26:46] that when the when you see the rat
[2:26:47] running toward the
[2:26:50] fire, you know what is chasing it, it's
[2:26:54] more dangerous than the
[2:26:58] fire. Praise be to
[2:27:01] God. But now
[2:27:04] here God has an expected
[2:27:11] end. This animal
[2:27:16] It
[2:27:17] realized if I run
[2:27:21] backward because I've been touring this
[2:27:25] place, I'm going to
[2:27:28] survive. If I fall in the
[2:27:31] safety, I'm going to
[2:27:33] drown. And indeed, that was
[2:27:37] it. These are animals without
[2:27:41] soul. But it's so beautiful.
[2:27:45] to see a child of
[2:27:47] God going toward sin
[2:27:50] [Applause]
[2:27:55] instinct. Praise be to
[2:27:58] God. He comes to
[2:28:01] church. He hears the word. The Holy
[2:28:04] Spirit moves. He enjoys the blessings of
[2:28:07] God. He goes out. it goes back to
[2:28:13] sin. You better pinch your
[2:28:17] conscience. But I'm here to tell you,
[2:28:20] you are not walking
[2:28:23] alone. If you're being if you've been
[2:28:25] doing those
[2:28:26] things, thinking that you are walking
[2:28:29] alone, know that there is a
[2:28:32] partner. There is a friend whom you have
[2:28:35] been hurting for all.
[2:28:39] Hallelujah.
[2:28:42] Praise be to
[2:28:43] God. God has a good thoughts toward
[2:28:47] us. He has a good plan for
[2:28:50] us. Praise be to God. Some even even
[2:28:54] when our children seems like they're
[2:28:56] going
[2:28:58] astray. Let us keep on our
[2:29:01] knees, knowing that God has a good plan
[2:29:04] for
[2:29:05] us. Amen. It is not yet
[2:29:10] over. Don't make the final
[2:29:14] conclusion that maybe he gave birth to
[2:29:16] serpent sin.
[2:29:19] Hallelujah. Amen. Don't make that
[2:29:23] conclusion. Praise be to
[2:29:26] God. It's not a serpent
[2:29:29] se until the
[2:29:33] end. Praise be to God.
[2:29:36] Why are you closing the ark
[2:29:39] in the seven days of
[2:29:43] grace? Hallelujah.
[2:29:46] Don't be brother
[2:29:48] Jonah. When God sent Jonah to
[2:29:51] Navy to go and preach the gospel and
[2:29:54] Jonah rebelled against
[2:29:56] God. Oh my God. Praise be to God. Now
[2:30:00] look here. Jonah thought that he was
[2:30:03] running away from God.
[2:30:06] Amen. But his
[2:30:08] rebellion, his
[2:30:09] disobedience draws him back to
[2:30:13] God. He refused to go to
[2:30:16] Navy and he went to Talis thinking was
[2:30:19] running away from God. But when he was
[2:30:22] cast into the
[2:30:23] sea, it was perfect will of
[2:30:27] God.
[2:30:29] Hallelujah. God had a special way.
[2:30:33] Not a speedboat this time. Not a
[2:30:36] titanic.
[2:30:38] No sir. It was a national speedy boat.
[2:30:44] Praise be to
[2:30:46] God. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. The
[2:30:50] man
[2:30:52] thought now let me even die
[2:30:55] now. Oh God. Look here. Jonah when he
[2:31:00] was cast into the sea. I trust he
[2:31:03] thought that was his
[2:31:06] end. It is
[2:31:09] finished. Then in Jeremiah
[2:31:14] 29, I know the thought that I
[2:31:18] have church, are you seeing
[2:31:21] this? He thought it had
[2:31:24] ended. He thought he was finished. He
[2:31:27] thought he was going to drown and
[2:31:29] perish.
[2:31:31] Hallelujah. Amen. But God
[2:31:34] said that is not his son. It is not yet
[2:31:38] over. I know they thought that I have to
[2:31:41] worry. And when Jonah fell there,
[2:31:44] hallelujah.
[2:31:46] The well was
[2:31:48] waiting and swallowed the
[2:31:51] guy. And Jonah was deep
[2:31:54] there. He realized he was not swallowing
[2:31:56] water.
[2:31:59] He realized he was not in the bottom of
[2:32:01] the
[2:32:01] seat and again was not on the top of the
[2:32:05] seat. So he started touching
[2:32:09] around say that Jonah had the worst
[2:32:16] symptom.
[2:32:18] Yes. Before you think your symptom is
[2:32:22] nagging that my situation is so
[2:32:25] worse. He never even said that Job had
[2:32:28] worse. He said
[2:32:32] Jonah remember the word of God comes to
[2:32:34] the
[2:32:36] prophet surely sure the Lord God will do
[2:32:39] nothing. Blessed be his seven servants
[2:32:41] the
[2:32:42] prophet. He said when Jonah touched this
[2:32:46] time, he touched on the wells for
[2:32:49] it. When he touched this
[2:32:52] time, maybe
[2:32:55] we rotten fish and other things like
[2:32:59] that. Praise be to God. He had the worst
[2:33:04] symptom. You think that your stomach
[2:33:08] ache is the worst
[2:33:10] symptom compared to Jonah's symptom?
[2:33:16] Amen. Maybe you here and you are going
[2:33:18] undergoing
[2:33:20] pain and you have licked
[2:33:22] it. I want to speak to that
[2:33:25] problem and tell it
[2:33:28] now. It is not yet
[2:33:31] over. God has not finished with
[2:33:34] me. He has a good plan for this moment.
[2:33:38] is going to turn my stomach
[2:33:40] trouble into a
[2:33:43] testimony and one of his days. You are
[2:33:46] going to stand here and you tell the
[2:33:49] church, "God bless
[2:33:51] you. I've been battling with kidney
[2:33:54] problem for this years, but God has
[2:33:58] healed
[2:33:59] me. Praise be to God." and another
[2:34:02] sister at the
[2:34:04] corner will say, "Praise be to
[2:34:07] God." Maybe the one who is about to give
[2:34:10] up, he will be she will be encouraged by
[2:34:13] your
[2:34:15] testimony. And both of you will glorify
[2:34:19] God. What you have to know, God has a
[2:34:23] good plan for
[2:34:26] us. Yes, sir.
[2:34:29] Maybe you don't even have a plot, a
[2:34:32] piece of
[2:34:34] land. Yes, sir.
[2:34:38] Maybe you don't even have fears for next
[2:34:45] term. Maybe you are not even
[2:34:48] sure whether your mother will get
[2:34:52] healed. But I have a message for you.
[2:34:56] God has a good plan for
[2:34:58] you, not for only you, for your entire
[2:35:03] family. He's bringing you to unexpected
[2:35:08] end. And all those things happening
[2:35:10] around
[2:35:11] us is driving us toward
[2:35:16] that. Yes, sir.
[2:35:19] Praise be to
[2:35:22] God. Amen. Amen. So when Jonah was in
[2:35:26] the
[2:35:28] well, Jonah never had any stop
[2:35:34] over. Yeah. Yeah. The well never had any
[2:35:38] [Music]
[2:35:39] stopover. It was called well
[2:35:42] express.
[2:35:44] Express. Well
[2:35:47] express.
[2:35:48] Amen. He refused to go the good way.
[2:35:53] It means to use the sheep.
[2:35:58] God said, "I have Oh, hallelujah." Amen.
[2:36:01] Jesus says, "If you stop them from
[2:36:04] praising,
[2:36:06] I can command these stones."
[2:36:09] Amen.
[2:36:11] When Jonah refused to use the
[2:36:14] ship, God had well
[2:36:20] expressed
[2:36:23] express when he fell
[2:36:27] inside. eat. He remained a little on the
[2:36:32] stage because when a fish eat
[2:36:37] something, according to the aquatic
[2:36:43] professionals, they say if something
[2:36:46] from water eats
[2:36:48] something, it goes at the
[2:36:51] bottom, it will just be there as
[2:36:54] it even a big snake when it swallows the
[2:36:57] python. When the
[2:36:59] python if it swallows
[2:37:03] something and say let me go look for
[2:37:05] another one. It can even take months in
[2:37:08] one
[2:37:09] place because it might swallow a
[2:37:13] cuff. Even all the bones and
[2:37:16] everything. So it sleeps as digestion
[2:37:19] takes
[2:37:20] place. But when Jonah entered that that
[2:37:24] stage, it remained somewhere.
[2:37:29] And it released that that insulin which
[2:37:33] beats up the food which breaks down
[2:37:34] those food.
[2:37:38] The food is not becoming soft. Praise be
[2:37:40] to God. This time the the became
[2:37:49] the Amen. Amen. I try to rest.
[2:37:57] Try to maybe try to vomit
[2:38:00] it. The thing will not come
[2:38:03] out. May it be it went to the
[2:38:09] colleague. Something is disturbing
[2:38:12] me. Praise be to God. The master was
[2:38:15] still under
[2:38:17] control.
[2:38:19] Amen. How did that started?
[2:38:23] May be there is a part which I'm which I
[2:38:26] was missing
[2:38:28] here. When Jonah was there for three
[2:38:31] days and three nights,
[2:38:35] he realized he was he was not
[2:38:38] dead. There was the seed of God in
[2:38:41] Jonah.
[2:38:43] Hallelujah. Amen. Maybe when he was in
[2:38:46] the in in well
[2:38:50] belly he started moving in the walls
[2:38:54] of what was he doing? He was looking for
[2:38:58] a
[2:38:59] network. He was moving
[2:39:09] there. You
[2:39:11] can you can pray from here. Praise be to
[2:39:14] God. Amen. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. When he
[2:39:16] got connected.
[2:39:19] Hallelujah. Amen. When the Bluetooth was
[2:39:22] connected
[2:39:24] and maybe had that
[2:39:26] sound Bluetooth connected connection,
[2:39:30] brother,
[2:39:32] sister started praying. Hallelujah.
[2:39:35] Amen.
[2:39:36] said,
[2:39:37] "Lord, you
[2:39:44] spoke." When they leave their
[2:39:48] eyes, he was in the
[2:39:51] B under the
[2:39:53] ocean. How did he know he was facing
[2:39:56] Jerusalem? The man was connected.
[2:39:59] Hallelujah.
[2:40:01] The man was connected, brother.
[2:40:06] So the network was
[2:40:07] pulling. The Bible says it the angel of
[2:40:11] the Lord come round about those who
[2:40:14] fears the name of the Lord. When the
[2:40:17] presence of God comes in
[2:40:19] you feel
[2:40:21] it when the angel is moving in the camp
[2:40:25] rather you feel the
[2:40:28] B. But for three days for the first day
[2:40:32] the man was struggling.
[2:40:36] The prayer was not
[2:40:37] moving. Have you ever woken up and
[2:40:40] pray and the prayer is not moving and
[2:40:43] you give
[2:40:44] up and begin talking to
[2:40:48] yourself and you again you start again.
[2:40:51] Praise be to God. But something was
[2:40:55] happening the second day.
[2:40:59] Hallelujah. He started filling the
[2:41:02] pool. He engaged the prayer gear.
[2:41:06] Hallelujah.
[2:41:08] The third
[2:41:09] day he forgot that he was in the belly
[2:41:12] of the
[2:41:14] fish. He was seeing the power of God.
[2:41:17] The Holy Ghost revealed to him that he
[2:41:20] was
[2:41:21] wrong. He rebelled against God. They
[2:41:25] say, "Oh God
[2:41:26] Almighty, you spake through your
[2:41:29] servant.
[2:41:31] will fall in trouble. He knew he was in
[2:41:34] the trouble. When he lift his eyes and
[2:41:37] look at
[2:41:38] Jerusalem, Jerusalem
[2:41:40] temple and
[2:41:42] pray to hear his prayer in
[2:41:45] heaven. Then the world
[2:41:48] started stomach
[2:41:51] ache,
[2:41:54] fever, yet it was in the water. Praise
[2:41:57] be to God. Amen.
[2:42:01] Then the master commanded,
[2:42:04] "Amen." I believe the well got
[2:42:08] confused. But also remember that it had
[2:42:11] a
[2:42:13] maker. The maker signaled the
[2:42:17] well and
[2:42:21] started. Praise be to God. The people of
[2:42:25] Nenev, they were worshiping idols. They
[2:42:29] had an God had their unexpected
[2:42:34] endon was not the God they supposed to
[2:42:38] worship in their
[2:42:41] ignorance. God had a special plan for
[2:42:45] them. Amen. And maybe it was their maybe
[2:42:49] it was their
[2:42:51] Christmas and they were around the beach
[2:42:54] that they enjoying sisters naked
[2:42:58] brothers putting on
[2:42:59] box children bathing and
[2:43:02] this hallelujah men on their
[2:43:05] shorts with their
[2:43:08] bish and all of a sudden the water was
[2:43:11] come.
[2:43:13] Hallelujah. Before they realized they
[2:43:16] saw something coming. So it is a sign of
[2:43:19] a
[2:43:22] wave. Oh, blessed be the name
[2:43:26] of God had a special gift for
[2:43:29] them. The well came to the
[2:43:33] seashore
[2:43:40] and be there. They had never seen their
[2:43:43] God in that in that
[2:43:49] manner. It was thus says the Lord.
[2:43:54] Praise be to
[2:43:55] God. Amen. Amen. The man started to
[2:44:01] preach. Jonah realized he was not
[2:44:04] alone. He had a reason to preach.
[2:44:07] Now, if you're waiting for problem to
[2:44:10] come, you are
[2:44:13] Then you start
[2:44:14] evangelizing. Then you start preaching.
[2:44:17] I'm here to tell you it's just then at
[2:44:20] the neighbor's door
[2:44:24] coming. But don't wait for
[2:44:27] that. You better start
[2:44:30] now.
[2:44:31] Amen. Then Jonah preached like never
[2:44:35] before.
[2:44:37] Those people they
[2:44:39] believe. All of them
[2:44:42] believe. The king left the
[2:44:45] throne and he came down and covered
[2:44:49] himself with
[2:44:51] ashes and sack
[2:44:54] clothes. He commanded the entire
[2:44:58] kingdom with even animals.
[2:45:01] Yes. Animal fasted.
[2:45:07] Praise be to
[2:45:08] God. No food, no
[2:45:11] water. And God's word was removed from
[2:45:14] the
[2:45:15] people. And the will of God was
[2:45:18] performed
[2:45:20] in. And the Navian were brought to God's
[2:45:24] unexpected
[2:45:29] end. Rather, we have a
[2:45:31] God who has a plan for
[2:45:34] us before the foundation of the
[2:45:37] world. He designed
[2:45:39] us, created us, and worked on us. He
[2:45:44] shaped us according to his
[2:45:47] will. And that is where we are
[2:45:50] going. Nothing will stop
[2:45:53] us.
[2:45:56] Hallelujah. There's nothing that is
[2:45:58] going to stop us.
[2:46:00] Blessed be the name of the Lord. You see
[2:46:03] the plan God had for
[2:46:05] Jonah. Joseph was thrown in the dish
[2:46:10] by his
[2:46:11] brethren. And from there he was sold to
[2:46:15] Egypt. And when he was in
[2:46:17] Egypt he was in Porta's
[2:46:21] house serving there. report how her wife
[2:46:26] wanted to know
[2:46:28] Joseph. Joseph
[2:46:30] escape, he was
[2:46:32] imprisoned. All those things were
[2:46:35] driving
[2:46:36] Joseph to God's perfect
[2:46:41] will. Amen. When Joseph was in the
[2:46:46] dish, his brother said before
[2:46:50] that let us kill him.
[2:46:53] But is our brother you know shedding
[2:46:56] human blood is not
[2:46:58] easy. People who shed their friends
[2:47:01] blood their demon
[2:47:07] incarnate. Then one brought a
[2:47:09] suggestion. Let us throw him in
[2:47:13] the throw the guy
[2:47:15] there. And the guy was deep there
[2:47:17] crying.
[2:47:19] Baba brother Baba brother.
[2:47:24] Give me some water,
[2:47:26] brother.
[2:47:27] The whole night that was
[2:47:33] irritating. So they had to remove him.
[2:47:36] And the following was sold to those who
[2:47:38] buy
[2:47:40] slaves. But God had a plan for Joseph.
[2:47:46] Nothing could harm
[2:47:48] Joseph. No sir.
[2:47:52] But all those things were driving him
[2:47:55] toward his
[2:47:59] success. Hallelujah. Just imagine from
[2:48:03] the wilderness where he was with his
[2:48:06] brothers and from there Joseph went to
[2:48:09] Portifa's
[2:48:11] house he was a high ranking
[2:48:14] man. And from
[2:48:16] there he enjoyed those privileges from
[2:48:19] anyone.
[2:48:23] Then after
[2:48:24] that the man ended up in
[2:48:27] prison. Joseph never cast
[2:48:31] God. Sister, are you
[2:48:34] here? Did you cast God when you were
[2:48:42] there? Amen. He never
[2:48:45] cast. And even when he was in the
[2:48:48] prison, my brother, his brother had a
[2:48:52] gift in
[2:48:54] him. Amen. Amen. He started where he
[2:48:59] stopped. He was a son of
[2:49:02] prosperity. He had Jesus in him. And
[2:49:06] Jesus is the son of
[2:49:07] prosperity. When he was at Pifer's
[2:49:10] house, everything was
[2:49:13] organized. Everything was okay.
[2:49:16] Everything was
[2:49:18] flowing until the boss's wife
[2:49:20] say this man is even smarter than my
[2:49:27] husband. I wish I can get
[2:49:30] him. I believe he was looking
[2:49:35] good and behaving well with good
[2:49:39] discipline very very good putting on
[2:49:43] modestly.
[2:49:52] Anyhow, why do you put on those tight
[2:49:54] clothes? You look as if you're tied
[2:49:57] up. Not Joseph.
[2:50:00] I believe the man was
[2:50:03] organized and it was nice because he had
[2:50:08] the spirit of
[2:50:09] Christ and where the spirit of God is,
[2:50:12] there is liberty.
[2:50:14] There was liberty all over the man's
[2:50:17] home. All the chaos was kicked
[2:50:20] out until he was admired by
[2:50:24] Portfas. But God was driving
[2:50:27] him to his perfect
[2:50:31] will. When Joseph was in
[2:50:34] prison, he was there with those two
[2:50:37] guys. One was a
[2:50:41] butler. The other one have forgotten
[2:50:43] what he was
[2:50:44] doing.
[2:50:47] Yes. Amen. And then one came up with a
[2:50:51] dream. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I
[2:50:55] believe this guy even
[2:50:58] smiled. Say, "Hey God, you are even
[2:51:00] here. You have come." Because he knew
[2:51:04] this guys telling him the
[2:51:07] dream. God made them to speak their
[2:51:10] dream.
[2:51:12] because an interpreter was
[2:51:16] there.
[2:51:17] Amen. He interpreted the
[2:51:20] dream and it came to
[2:51:22] pass. God had a
[2:51:25] plan. He was not
[2:51:27] alone. Believers, we are not
[2:51:30] alone. We will never be alone.
[2:51:33] Even when Jesus
[2:51:36] died and we reached that death
[2:51:39] bed, when I come to the
[2:51:43] river at the ending of the
[2:51:47] day, when all the battle is
[2:51:50] won, there is somebody
[2:51:52] waiting to show us the
[2:51:55] way. Hallelujah. Amen. When we come to
[2:51:59] the end of the
[2:52:00] river, when the Lord
[2:52:03] brother and maybe we are going maybe we
[2:52:06] are we are dying of the whole
[2:52:09] earth. Oh God allowed us to be taken by
[2:52:13] sickness is still leading the
[2:52:16] way because the Lord God us all
[2:52:20] our but one thing we are sure of. Be
[2:52:24] sure that you are not alone. Be sure
[2:52:26] that you have the Holy Ghost. Visualize
[2:52:29] God leading your life. When you come to
[2:52:32] that
[2:52:34] time, you
[2:52:36] will give a
[2:52:40] smile. You'll tell them taking care of
[2:52:42] you at the
[2:52:45] hospital. And your
[2:52:49] relatives, this is my humble
[2:52:51] request. You've done your
[2:52:54] best. You've prayed, pastor. I've
[2:52:57] prayed.
[2:52:58] church. They are
[2:52:59] praying. You've done your
[2:53:02] best. Doctors have performed their
[2:53:06] part. Now
[2:53:09] relax. I'm going
[2:53:11] home. Hallelujah. Praise be to God. And
[2:53:15] if those people are believers
[2:53:18] enough, they will not go beyond
[2:53:23] that. I remember one time I told of a
[2:53:25] pastor
[2:53:27] He preached a sermon like
[2:53:29] this after when he had
[2:53:33] preached either night before I'm I'm
[2:53:35] forgetting either night
[2:53:38] before before he
[2:53:40] left he prayed for his family pray for
[2:53:43] the wife prayed for his children prayed
[2:53:46] for
[2:53:48] everything and then he left and that day
[2:53:52] he preached his last sermon.
[2:53:55] My wife don't be scared that my
[2:53:58] life. No, I'm here. I'm waiting for
[2:54:02] rapture. But if he calls me
[2:54:04] now, I'm still a winner either
[2:54:07] way. We are winner either
[2:54:11] way. Amen. Amen. When rapture takes
[2:54:15] us, the better. When God calls us
[2:54:19] now, we are
[2:54:21] winners. There is no losing in God.
[2:54:26] No
[2:54:26] loss because we are not alone. When we
[2:54:30] come at the end of the
[2:54:33] river, my angel
[2:54:37] will be
[2:54:38] there waiting for me. Your angel will be
[2:54:43] there waiting for you.
[2:54:46] Amen.
[2:54:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just know you
[2:54:50] are not
[2:54:51] alone. When you are
[2:54:53] sinning, know there is an eye washing
[2:54:56] you. When you are
[2:54:58] abusing, when you are
[2:55:00] arduing, mind you, there is an
[2:55:05] eye. Amen. Someone is watching at
[2:55:09] you. You are not
[2:55:11] alone. When you are
[2:55:14] sick, when you are
[2:55:16] hungry, don't steal because you are
[2:55:19] hungry.
[2:55:21] You are not alone.
[2:55:24] Amen. Amen. When there is no food,
[2:55:28] instead of
[2:55:30] stealing, use that tool as a
[2:55:34] blessing and tell the
[2:55:37] devil. Speak to hunger is not the
[2:55:41] devil. Stealing is the
[2:55:43] devil. The devil come and hide in the
[2:55:47] hunger. Speak to that hunger.
[2:55:50] and tell that hunger man shall not
[2:55:53] live by bread
[2:55:55] alone. Hallelujah.
[2:55:58] But by every word that comes from the
[2:56:01] mouth of
[2:56:03] God. Are you a
[2:56:05] student, you are school, you have run
[2:56:09] out
[2:56:10] of you have no
[2:56:13] sugar, no
[2:56:14] ginat, no pocket money. Your neighbor
[2:56:18] has forgotten his suitcase open. His
[2:56:20] suitcase is there
[2:56:23] open. And you seeing abundance of
[2:56:27] 200,000 5 kg of
[2:56:29] gut and your heart is pumping like like
[2:56:32] a heart.
[2:56:39] You are not alone.
[2:56:42] He's just washing at you.
[2:56:46] He won't see what are you going to
[2:56:48] do. Many time when I'm
[2:56:52] broke. When I go to the
[2:56:55] shop, you give the person
[2:56:59] 5,000 then they give a change of 40
[2:57:01] 48,000.
[2:57:06] What do you do?
[2:57:16] It always happens at
[2:57:20] night. You go to the mobile money, you
[2:57:24] withdraw
[2:57:25] 10,000 or 20, they give you
[2:57:29] 50. What do you
[2:57:32] do? You are not
[2:57:36] alone. Don't speak like our Muslim
[2:57:38] brothers.
[2:57:41] This
[2:57:47] is Allah has decided it but Jehovah's
[2:57:51] not
[2:57:52] decided and you are not a Moses. You are
[2:57:57] Christlike. We are
[2:58:00] Christians. Praise be to
[2:58:05] God. Just know you are not alone. But
[2:58:08] one thing I'm sure of
[2:58:10] When you overcome that
[2:58:11] temptation, two days will not
[2:58:14] elapse without a miracle. That is the
[2:58:17] God we are
[2:58:19] serving. Amen. That is the God we are
[2:58:22] serving.
[2:58:23] Brothers, we are not alone. There are
[2:58:26] many, many, many more
[2:58:28] examples. There are many people spoke
[2:58:32] about. Hallelujah.
[2:58:35] And as I'm
[2:58:38] finishing, my good
[2:58:42] lord, there is still a
[2:58:45] lot. But there are many
[2:58:49] examples people who thought they walking
[2:58:52] alone and Hannah was
[2:58:55] troubled. every penny is giving
[2:59:00] birth and I believe adding with even
[2:59:03] some bad
[2:59:07] words. I know my confused husband loves
[2:59:09] you so
[2:59:11] much. It's just because he's
[2:59:14] confused. I can give a wonderful woman
[2:59:17] like
[2:59:18] me. I'm giving birth, but I'm so
[2:59:21] beautiful. I look
[2:59:23] 20 yet I'm in my 40s.
[2:59:28] But
[2:59:29] you you look like a scrub
[2:59:33] man when he come he gives you a bigger
[2:59:37] portion that one of these days his eyes
[2:59:40] will be
[2:59:42] open and that's what the devil speaks to
[2:59:45] each one of us.
[2:59:50] Do you feel like a
[2:59:57] Christian? Are you
[2:59:59] bride of even
[3:00:02] Christ? You know
[3:00:07] Christ for I saw that I saw him there.
[3:00:10] You can't be his
[3:00:12] bride. And then you also accommodate the
[3:00:15] same
[3:00:18] thought. You did
[3:00:21] this. You're just from abusing your
[3:00:23] son. But you are
[3:00:27] praying. What are you praying? God is
[3:00:31] holy. And what you must be
[3:00:34] holy. And you listen to the guy's
[3:00:36] gospel.
[3:00:41] Brother, you already know what to
[3:00:44] do. When you hurt your
[3:00:48] husband, you know how to tune
[3:00:52] him. Praise be to
[3:00:54] God. Tell the
[3:00:56] devil. It is true. I've been abused
[3:01:03] accidentally. But that one does not take
[3:01:05] away my love for him.
[3:01:10] Amen. We made a
[3:01:14] vow. He made unconditioned
[3:01:18] covenant. Look the devil in his
[3:01:23] eyes. Tell him you blind but
[3:01:28] devil
[3:01:31] serpent. God have unconditional
[3:01:34] covenant.
[3:01:37] to begin with. I never chose
[3:01:39] him. He shows me the way I
[3:01:42] am with my
[3:01:44] life. He's working on
[3:01:51] me. I know what I'm going to be. He
[3:01:55] knows what he want me to
[3:01:57] be.
[3:01:58] Amen. And that is going to even improve
[3:02:01] your relation relationship with God.
[3:02:05] Lord, I've hurt you, Lord, but God, I'm
[3:02:08] sorry. Give me the grace not to do it
[3:02:13] again. And the devil will call in his
[3:02:17] tail. The devil has every bad
[3:02:25] description. The devil fell so
[3:02:28] deep. The
[3:02:30] Satan Satan fell so bad. He operates in
[3:02:35] B
[3:02:37] in sometime even in
[3:02:40] Iraq. He tried pigs but pigs were
[3:02:43] smarter than him.
[3:02:48] So the guy
[3:02:50] fell. He's in the
[3:02:52] drunkards in
[3:02:55] which
[3:02:56] adulterers,
[3:02:58] fornicators, how can you dare that guy
[3:03:01] is preaching to you a
[3:03:03] sermon. Don't even give him a
[3:03:07] second. The Bible say resist the devil
[3:03:10] and the devil will flee. Submit yourself
[3:03:13] to God. Throw near around to God. He
[3:03:17] will throw near to you. Resist the devil
[3:03:21] and the devil will flee. Shall we rise
[3:03:23] on our feet?
[3:03:25] Hallelujah. Amen. That is the God we
[3:03:28] shout. We are not
[3:03:30] alone. We have a God who moves the
[3:03:34] mountain. Do you have any mountain this
[3:03:37] morning? Are you troubled in your soul?
[3:03:41] I have brought you Jesus.
[3:03:44] And I and I challenge you this afternoon
[3:03:48] to open your hearts to Jesus Christ.
[3:03:52] I not got a sermon from the
[3:03:54] blue but God himself brought
[3:03:58] it and I trust you have a reason
[3:04:01] why he wanted to encourage us
[3:04:03] brother. My sister that we are not
[3:04:06] alone.
[3:04:08] Do not
[3:04:09] fear, do not
[3:04:11] worry. Musician, you give us that song
[3:04:14] of only
[3:04:16] belief. All things are
[3:04:18] possible because you have known that we
[3:04:20] are never
[3:04:22] alone. We are not alone. Brother,
[3:04:25] sister, Jesus is in our midst. He says
[3:04:29] two or three gathers in his name, he
[3:04:33] will come and be in their midst. That
[3:04:36] God who spoke in the beginning, the word
[3:04:40] into
[3:04:41] existence, who spoke your
[3:04:43] body, is here to correct you. He's here
[3:04:47] to heal
[3:04:48] it. Just lift up your hand this
[3:04:50] afternoon and believe
[3:04:53] Jesus that is here that is going to heal
[3:04:56] you. Maybe you are sick. You are
[3:05:00] troubled in your spirit. I challenge you
[3:05:02] this afternoon to believe the word of
[3:05:05] God to believe the message of the hour.
[3:05:09] I have quotes but I not even reached
[3:05:12] there. But my brother, my
[3:05:14] sister, I have preached you the full
[3:05:17] word of
[3:05:18] God because he told
[3:05:20] us he will never leave us
[3:05:23] again. A thousand will rise and 10,000
[3:05:27] but not come near.
[3:05:31] They will come in one
[3:05:33] way. He will scatter them in seven
[3:05:37] direction. That same God spoke to Moses
[3:05:41] and told him that I will be with
[3:05:43] you. I will never leave you. I will
[3:05:47] never forsake you. That God spoke to
[3:05:50] Moses. He spoke to
[3:05:53] Joshua. Be of good courage. God spoke to
[3:05:56] Joshua. He specializes in things
[3:05:58] impossible.
[3:06:00] And that God is speaking to you this
[3:06:02] afternoon that you are not alone in that
[3:06:06] condition. Hallelujah.
[3:06:09] Hallelujah. Amen. You are not alone in
[3:06:12] that physical
[3:06:14] condition. You are not alone in that
[3:06:16] financial
[3:06:18] condition. But God is working it out for
[3:06:21] you. Whatever you're going through this
[3:06:24] afternoon will bring you to an expected
[3:06:27] end because he knows the plan he has
[3:06:30] toward you. It's only him who knows.
[3:06:34] That's why when the devil thought that
[3:06:36] he had finished
[3:06:37] Jesus God had a
[3:06:39] plan. He told Job I know he spoke to he
[3:06:44] spoke to this
[3:06:47] church and told them I know you are
[3:06:50] suffering. I know what you're going
[3:06:52] through. I know you are
[3:06:55] troubled. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:06:59] Why don't you speak to him this
[3:07:01] afternoon? Why don't you surrender your
[3:07:04] hearts to
[3:07:05] him? Maybe you are sick and
[3:07:08] athletic. I want to assure you in the
[3:07:10] name
[3:07:11] of the name which is
[3:07:14] sanctioned the name above all other
[3:07:17] names when that name is
[3:07:19] mentioned sickness will have to go one
[3:07:22] day that name was
[3:07:24] mentioned
[3:07:25] hallelujah at the gate of beautiful and
[3:07:29] the lame man he
[3:07:31] lived and he
[3:07:34] walked that name put on
[3:07:36] flesh which is the pool of path
[3:07:39] tiger and the sick
[3:07:42] man who was there for 38 years.
[3:07:48] God is healing.
[3:07:50] Jesus Christ is the same. Yes,
[3:07:53] today and
[3:07:55] forever. Can you feel his presence just
[3:07:58] right
[3:07:59] now? The presence of the Lord moving in
[3:08:01] our
[3:08:03] lives. Lift up your
[3:08:05] faith and touch the Lord.

[3:08:22] here to provide. He's here to give you
[3:08:25] the holiness. He's here to fix your
[3:08:28] stress.

[3:08:47] power. Lord I pray Lord
[3:08:49] Jesus with my brothers and
[3:08:52] sisters that will stretch forth your
[3:08:54] healing
[3:08:56] heart. Yes Lord
[3:08:58] Jesus. For the Bible says that because
[3:09:00] of the
[3:09:01] anointing the yoke will be
[3:09:04] broken. You've never sinned your
[3:09:07] word in vain my
[3:09:09] master and the time you send
[3:09:14] it produce a
[3:09:17] result. Lord have spoken to your
[3:09:21] children. I pray that may the Holy
[3:09:24] Spirit water this
[3:09:26] morning. May you send the law enforce
[3:09:28] the Holy
[3:09:31] Ghost to enforce thy promise in our
[3:09:33] lives.
[3:09:36] because you have a promise in our
[3:09:39] life that will never leave us on the
[3:09:42] way. The Lord you will see us
[3:09:45] through and we want to thank you that
[3:09:48] Lord you are not leaving
[3:09:50] us but you are guiding us on the way. We
[3:09:54] are glad to know whatever is happening
[3:09:57] around us whatever happened in our
[3:10:00] life but is still part of your plan.
[3:10:05] is to bring us close to you. You are
[3:10:08] still the one leading the way. We thank
[3:10:11] you this afternoon, my master. Let
[3:10:13] nobody leave here
[3:10:15] untouched. Let no sick person go back
[3:10:18] with
[3:10:19] sickness. My brother, my
[3:10:22] sister who is sick and
[3:10:24] afflicted, I challenge you to believe
[3:10:26] the Lord Jesus Christ. For the Lord is
[3:10:29] here.
[3:10:31] Don't go back with that
[3:10:35] sickness. Let that shame drop.
[3:10:40] Yes
[3:10:42] Lord. You are breaking every shame.
[3:10:46] You are breaking every shackle this
[3:10:48] morning. Every sickness is leaving
[3:10:52] us. Every trouble.
[3:10:55] Every sick heart is being healed
[3:10:58] Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus.

[3:11:42] ascended on high, the one who went deep,
[3:11:45] Lord, he ascended on high and when he
[3:11:49] ascended on high, Lord Jesus, Lord, you

[3:12:08] of the Holy Ghost, you are healing that
[3:12:10] sick body in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:12:13] Christ. I remember my sister praise

[3:12:34] right to me our
[3:12:36] sister with things and
[3:12:38] go in the bottomless pit. Lord arise
[3:12:42] Lord Jesus and let our enemies be
[3:12:45] scattered. Stretch forth your healing
[3:12:47] arms and touch us from the crown of our
[3:12:50] head to the sole of our feet. We refuse

[3:14:26] plan. Maybe if we knew that plan
[3:14:30] Lord would have we would have closed it
[3:14:32] to the
[3:14:34] devil. But father because Lord Jesus is
[3:14:38] a sacred
[3:14:39] Lord that thou knowest it father but we
