[0:00] I mean so in the book of second Peter
[0:02] chapter 3 verse 9.
[0:05] the Lord is not luck concerning his
[0:08] promise
[0:09] as some men counts likeness but is
[0:13] long-suffering to us word not willing
[0:16] that any should perish but that all
[0:19] should come to repentance
[0:30] [Music]
[0:39] amen the Lord is
[0:45] but it's long-suffering
[0:49] and we want to talk about the patience
[0:51] of God
[0:56] amen amen so we find that uh Peter right
[1:00] here
[1:03] Christian
[1:08] [Music]
[1:11] because Peter represents a very let me
[1:14] say normal life of a human being
[1:18] and his life with with God
[1:22] remember Peter was out fishing sometimes
[1:26] Jesus never found him
[1:30] self he found him out there in the in
[1:31] the in the lake fishing
[1:34] just a common man like you and me
[1:37] doing his Daily Business
[1:39] Peter was married he had a wife and
[1:42] children
[1:43] amen so he was just a normal human being
[1:46] just living his business people knew him
[1:50] as a fisherman
[1:54] when they wanted good fish
[1:57] one man that was always mentioned
[2:03] amen so he was just a common man
[2:07] out there in his normal business
[2:34] [Music]
[3:08] foreign
[3:55] [Applause]
[4:07] and I know when fish can come
[5:02] [Applause]
[5:08] oh yeah
[5:15] [Applause]
[5:46] amen man
[5:49] so he's looked at Jesus yes another
[5:52] Common Man
[5:54] Jesus was just another company
[5:56] by the sight of man
[5:59] amen amen but Jesus even the evening
[6:04] before
[6:06] when Peter Was preparing
[6:09] to go and fish
[6:11] yesterday Joe wherever Jesus was
[6:15] maybe 15 miles away
[6:18] so far away but when Peter was washing
[6:23] the fish to go to that River
[6:26] Jesus was saying Peter yes
[6:33] that there's no single fish coming here
[6:37] amen amen that's the Jesus
[6:40] he knows what you are pursuing he even
[6:44] says that he knows your needs
[6:46] he knows every desire foreign
[7:36] [Applause]
[7:48] amen
[8:02] and he created that situation
[8:06] and Peter came and labored president he
[8:10] could have blamed the moon
[8:12] because he knows the moon controls the
[8:14] waters
[8:17] so he may have really pointed at the
[8:19] moon
[8:20] and say why did the clouds come today
[8:26] he may have turned to the brothers
[8:29] I told you Brothers
[8:35] you know that's normally what happens to
[8:38] a human being
[8:44] it is because of you it is because of
[8:48] something else even we blame ourselves
[8:51] because I was born in this family
[8:54] it is because I was born in this region
[8:58] because I was born in Africa
[9:00] it is because I
[9:58] [Applause]
[9:59] and when the man came out foreign
[10:10] amen I mean I need to please God he
[10:14] looks at it
[10:16] this is very good
[10:19] Hallelujah so now we blame everything
[10:24] we blame our situations
[10:39] [Music]
[10:46] [Music]
[11:15] that God knows everybody
[11:17] God loves everybody even provides food
[11:21] to the terrorists never
[11:24] foreign
[11:32] [Music]
[11:53] [Applause]
[12:39] foreign
[13:40] so Jesus came his way
[13:42] Peter are the most unexpected times
[13:45] maybe Peter's not dreaming about it
[13:47] he was dreaming about the fish maybe he
[13:51] had a good tender from somewhere
[13:54] to deliver fish worth 50 million in that
[13:58] Community but he was one more than Peter
[14:01] or more than there were 50 million
[14:05] he was God himself and he came his way
[14:09] God came his way
[14:11] he had to pass this way and tonight
[14:15] Jesus is passing this he has to pass
[14:19] this way and to tell you my brother I'll
[14:23] tell you my sisters God does not just
[14:25] want you to suffer
[14:27] God is not a regular sea he's not a
[14:31] Rastafarian it is the Rastafarians who
[14:35] says that I was born to suffer
[14:40] amen
[14:48] [Applause]
[14:57] [Applause]
[15:10] born to suffering
[15:14] that is for other people
[15:17] not for the children of God
[15:19] Jesus was not born to suffer yesterday
[15:21] he was born to go through suffering yes
[15:26] yes
[15:29] but his Destiny he was not suffering
[15:33] others he could still be in hell today
[15:38] but we know amen amen he was only for a
[15:43] short time
[15:44] and he never went to fight the devil
[15:47] he went to kick the devil he went to
[15:50] bring down the devil okay
[15:54] bring Deliverance to the captives to set
[15:59] us free
[16:00] amen so you are not born to suffice
[16:07] but because of your current situation
[16:10] because of the sickness
