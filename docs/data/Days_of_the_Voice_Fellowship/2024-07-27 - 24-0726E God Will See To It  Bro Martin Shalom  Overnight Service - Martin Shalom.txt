bread of life that come Father which come from heaven in Jesus name we pray amen you turn to me Genesis Genesis chapter 22 begin from vers 1 I welcome you all this evening the presence of the Lord thank you for coming our pastor you most welcome amen and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thy only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moriah and of and offer him there for a burand offering upon one of the mountain which I will tell thee of of and Abraham rose up early in the morning and S his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went up the place of God uh the place of which God had told him then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off and Abram said unto his unto his young man abide here with us and and I and the Lord will go under and worship and come again to you and Abraham took the word of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac's son and took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father and said my father and said he here I am my son and he said behold the fire behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for the for burnt offering and Abram said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here I am and said lay not thine hand upon the Lord neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing thou Hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me may the Lord add the blessing the reading of his word amen praise be to God yeah I just have something small that I want us to share tonight and I will call it uh the prophet preached the message Jehovah gy and uh I just want to call it it's the same thing but I want to call it God will see to it amen blessed be the name of the Lord praise be to God yeah that's the God we are serving praise the Lord is Jehovah JRA is God who provide he has always been our provider he will provide until the Rapture amen even the Rapture is his provision blessed be the name of the Lord and here where we have read in Genesis chapter 22 from vers 1 all Bible readers we have read this uh multiple times preachers have preached about it and all of us I believe we know this how when God called Abraham said it came to pass after these things that God tempt Abraham God gave Abraham a promise and that was of Isaac amen and when Isaac was born God tried Abraham amen by asking Abraham to offer his only son blessed be the name of the Lord and you know Abraham was uh Sarah was a baren woman and was she was of age and Abraham was of age but Abraham the Bible says that he did not stagger at the promise of God but he believed God Amen every single day he was thanking God for the promise blessed be the name of the Lord he had not seen the promise but he believed that God who promised it he will bring it to pass blessed be the name of the Lord and when we see the Heroes of Faith Abraham is mentioned there amen blessed be the name of the Lord and I will start by quoting this message God's providing healing for this generation the prophet say that God can do all things he is Jehovah CH amen he's God who can do all things amen that's why the bible say that to them to those who believe all things are possible and what makes it possible is when Christ is there when God is there all things are possible when God comes in our mids tonight all things are possible what makes it possible is the presence of of God in our midest amen when God is in a family all things are possible when God is in business all things are possible when God is in our plans all things are possible amen that is what maketh difference and that's why it's up to us to allow God to be in our lives amen it's upon us to allow God to be in our midst because when God is there he makes all things possible blessed be the name of the Lord that's why the prophet say that message when Jesus come and call that when Jesus goes the trouble is on the way because when he leaves things will be hard amen because he is not there blessed be the name of the Lord but I'm talking tonight about God who will provide amen blessed be the name of the Lord that God that's the God we are serving praise the Lord and here Abraham and Abraham rose up early in the morning and he said take now thy son the only son whom thou lovest blessed be the name of the Lord indeed Abraham loved Isaac and get thee in the land of Moriah out offer him there for bur offering praise be to God you know in the whole Bible there's nowhere where God where they have ever given a human being as a BN offering praise be to God but God had a way he was trying Abraham to see what he will do praise be to God so he is Jehovah jirra the very God who gave Abraham Isaac that same God had a plan B for for Abraham the same God who called Israel out of Egypt he only told them about the promised land he never talked about the mountain about the FR tribe or the strange tribe amen all the Hostile tribe but he told them he's taking them to the promised land land that same God who called us he only told us about the Rapture the promise amen the Holy Ghost amen so this other thing God will take care of that's why when God told Abraham to offer his son Abraham never even knew that God had Plan B but Abraham had faith in God because the Bible says that whosoever comes to God must believe that he is you have to first believe that God is God that God is not man when God promise he will make it to come to pass amen when he say that he will supply our needs according to his riches in glory he means that indeed God is our source of Supply when he say that he will heal your body he means that when he says we give you salvation that's what God means it amen it's up to you to believe what God says blessed be the name of the Lord when he tells us that he will see us through it's up to you to believe amen that God will see us through blessed be the name of the Lord so when he told Abraham to go off for his son he knew that Abraham loved his son God knows that you love your bed so much that's why it tells to come in the overnight and thanks be to God that you have obeyed and you have come amen praise be to God so because you have taken the first step blessed be the name of the Lord sometime we come and the devil want try to make us do but brother sister you are here because God has called you to come overnight we have come for the overnight praise be to God because every time God gathers us he has something for us each time time we come to meet God every time the president calls for a meeting I'm telling you there will be exchange of envelopes amen so this is our pra be to God and each time we come here God has something for us amen and we should not miss that every time we come he want to heal us he want to revive us amen he want to restore us he want to strengthen us he want to renew us amen praise be to God because the coming of the Lord is near the way is getting narrow every day amen we approaching the peak of the pyramid praise be to God the way is getting narrow every single minute so we need more of him we need more of his anointing in fact we need God has to Triple his anointing blessed be the name of the Lord amen and he came to pass this it says here that no matter what the doctor says no matter what the people say he is Jehovah G the Lord will provide in an instant time the sacrifice is needed blessed be the name of the Lord that is in the message faith of Abraham the Lord will provide in that instant time because Lazarus was there for 4 days that it was too late but it was not too late it was the right right time amen and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's still working the same way praise be to God most time we think it is too late for him amen say but Pastor now it is too late but my brother my sister God comes on time blessed be the name of the Lord Abraham moved for good number of days amen he was going to sacrifice his son and God was seeing all these things amen God already prepar prepared a lamb to be sacrificed blessed be the name of the Lord so the God I'm talking about tonight is that God will see it whatever you've been praying for whatever you're asking from God Amen just have faith and be sure that God is going to make it come to pass blessed be the name of the Lord because when God spoke to Abraham he had already a solution for himam say that God want to see how he react God liked trying his children amen he made them to pass through the Wilderness because he wanted to see what was in their heart not in a bad way praise be to God that's why the bible say that all things work together for good he is still Jehovah Gyra he still our provider that God still provide amen he still heals we are living in the time where healing you will even hardly hear people testify about the healing amen but doesn't mean that healing is not there healing is there amen it's in our midst blessed be the name of the Lord sometime we just don't want to testify few days ago uh my daughter got uh she was attacked by chicken pox and I was so close to her being that the mother has a little baby so I had to take the risk amen and just two I think two days down the road I realized I had the same thing blessed be the name of the Lord and those who have ever suffered from it it's not something by the simple but just imagine I'm much person like me it looks so awkward so funny amen so I asked myself God really I started itching itching and we're busy here working but thanks be to God Amen I never even pray that God I resist this demon what no I just said let me work for God God will work for me blessed be the name of the Lord I want to tell you that even the drugs I bought I think I only took three capsules 3 days down the road I realized the thing was not there blessed be the name of the Lord amen so Jesus is still a Healer amen so my labor was not in vain I surrendered my life regardless of the fatigue the pain in the body and the what God healed me instantly blessed be the name of the Lord and that same Spirit still buzzing at home there I realize my two my other two kids also they are showing the sign but the same Jesus will heal them blessed be the name of the Lord just when he tried me he realized that he was he was he tampered with the wrong button Jesus gave him a good slap blessed be the name of the Lord so that same Jesus the Same God you know sometime the B say the same the same God who heals flu is the the same power that heals flu is the same power that heals cancer so God has no weaker point and stronger Point amen so that same same power is the still the same power that can raise the dead so that God will bring it to pass amen if you have a need tonight I'm here to tell you that Jesus will bring that to pass if you can only believe amen so our God is Jehovah Gyra Our God will bring it to pass amen he will answer all your prayers tonight he will set you free he will meet your needs he will restore you amen he will revive you blessed be the name of the Lord amen it came to pass these things that God did tempt Abraham and said un him Abraham he said behold here I am and say take now thy son and thy only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee in the land of morai and offer him for a burnt offering upon one of this mountain which I will tell thee not only G but even I will tell you where to offer the boy blessed be the name of the Lord he was not supposed to offer him anywhere but this man was following the leadership of God when God is trying us his trial always comes with the leadership blessed be the name of the Lord we cannot say that we are tried time after time there there even no voice of God because the bible say that God is not the author of confusion amen and this man rose up very early in the morning and went with a boy and his servant blessed be the name of the Lord for the Bible tells us in Isaiah 1: 19 that if you be willing and obedient you shall eat the good of the land this comes with willingness and obedience Abraham first of all he was willing to offer his son amen and another thing he had to obey the voice of God and that's why the scripture say that if we be willing and obedient amen we shall eat the good of the land if we be willing if we be willing and be obedient to the word of God we shall eat the fruit of the land we shall receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost if we be willing and obedient to the word amen there is a promise as long as there is willingness and obedience blessed be the name of the Lord and God want us to be willing God want us to be obedient to the word to follow his voice to listen to his voice Amen to follow the word to walk according to his word blessed be the name of the Lord there is a promise amen he has given us the promise if we be willing and obedient we shall eat the fruit of the the Land There is healing there is Deliverance there is Victory there is Revival there is Vision amen all those are the fruits of obedience as long as you are willing to obey praise be to God we shall enjoy all those things the Bible tells us should not quench the spirit of God we should never quench the Revival in our midst amen when we see the glimpse of Revival in our midst in fact we should even seek God more say God send us more out of this amen we should never allow to have cold Services cold worship form worship amen where your hands are heavy as if they're not yours we should never allow that amen because when the presence of God comes down he change even the setup of worship the worship has become Swift in worship amen people would jump like like so we should reach that point where it's not us doing it but it is God in us doing it blessed be the name of the Lord but bam said that when a man catches the vision of the invisible God in the message looking at Unseen and know that he is all always present there is something that stabilizes that man is thinking it stabilizes his actions amen knowing that God is present in our midst knowing that God is in our midst he said there is something that stabilizes that man is thinking the reason that's why we don't have stabilized mind is because we are not sure that God is in our midst but says the prophet that when God is in our midst it stabilizes not only your thinking even your action you will not just worship anyhow loudly you just sing anyhow praise be to God let me walk bless Lord in the way thou Hast gone leading straight to the you're not sure whether you're in that way and that way is the way of the word it is the way of the Cross so when you are singing it amen let me walk blessed because you know what we talking about so that's why I see that when we are certain when man catches the vision of the invisible God that that invisible God is Incarnate in you that stabilizes your mind amen it stabilizes even your heart because you know that you are the incet of the invisible God blessed be the name of the Lord and that makes sure that he's always present with you he always works with us blessed be the name of the Lord and it says simpol ases the action and in the time of distress and trouble it is still making him look upward above things that are happening around him praise be to God do you think Abraham was scared of what was happening around him this man had caught the vision he saw the age at which God gave him that boy and the same God has asked for the boy and I believe here that Abraham was looking upward above the things that was happening around him because he is looking at his he is looking at the Unseen blessed be the name of the Lord amen so may God help us catch that Vision may God stabilizes our mind may God symbolizes our faith amen but what I'm saying that a Christian is not tossed around from Pillar To Post when we accept Jesus Christ and he comes and dwell in us that stabilizes us amen oh what blessings for us to be stabilized in Christ there is stability in Christ Jesus amen when we in denomination we were tossed by Winds of every Doctrine but when Jesus revealed himself to us and we accepted him he revealed this message to us this all stabilizes us blessed be the name of the Lord psalms 27 20 ver 7 say that some trust in Chariot and some in horses but we will remember the name of our Lord we will remember the name of our Lord because the name of the Lord is strong and mighty tower that's where righteous are secured amen our security is in the Lord that's why we says that Jesus at a mention of your names flowers grow that days are Blossom again our stability is in the Lord his name is our Strong Tower it's our security it's our defense it's our shelter amen Jesus is a rock in a we land he's a shelter in time of the storm amen not only the name but when Jesus in is in our soul our Soul Is Anchored In The Lord some in charot because from state house in the name of the president blessed be the name of the Lord how about Christians if we have Jesus everything will have to give away because he is our anchor he's our and that's why we speak with authority not only to the Devil by the way but both the devil and even to our fellow men blessed be the name of the Lord [Music] amen but when I'm say this message the uncertain sound that he is Jehovah J and he can provide himself anything that his word say anything that the word says God can provide it so talk of anything do you have anything you want as long as his word say the prophet say that God can provide Peace of Mind healing Deliverance Victory wife husband talk of anything Church land church building Rapture Holy Ghost as long as his words say he can provide I believe that do you believe that amen so let us approach him in his word Lord you said this you said this you did this to Abra because the Bible tells us what we are reading here what we are seeing here this was for our examples so if he did for them amen he can do it for you if he did for Isaac if he did for shame even single you God has your husband if God into sister favor even sister you God as you are brand new blessed be the name of the Lord his word has said [Applause] so blessed be the name of the Lord amen and amen he can provide for himself anything praise be to God so let us trust in God let's trust in him is more than able to provide is still Jehovah Gyra he still our peace he still our fighter church let us rise let us keep ourself on our knees let us fight our battle the proper way let let us fight on our [Music] knees Amen Let us be on fire for God let us seek him while still near amen pray to the maximum amen prop pray amen praise be to God you've been sleeping for the last 30 years 20 years 15 years so let us pray we have slept enough amen so you say time to rise blessed be the name of the Lord the promises of God is still the same God has not changed but is waiting for man and woman amen those men and women who are going to ride R and meet the challenge let us challenge ourselves Amen Let us be desperate for god without desperation we cannot get anything from God when a Christian is not desperate there's something wrong because we all to be desperate Daniel was desperate when he was in Babylon Abraham was desperate when he was looking for a child praise be to God Sarah was desperate Anna was desperate it is only a Christian when they're seeing things when things are not moving right you find when they settle but nowhere in the Bible nowhere sir a pregnant mother when the baby is not moving when there's nothing like any movement in the womb the mother will become concern blessed be the name of the Lord and we believe that we have the seed of God in us and you you was laying dant and you are just okay blessed be the name of the Lord Believers let us be desperate May God give us desperation in our heart it is my prayer that God should never leave us to rest until each and every member is desperate for him amen when someone is convicted and knows that he's condemned and is waiting for the day of execution blessed be the name of the Lord he will not sleep Believers have forgotten their responsibility we don't know what we supposed to do some are suffering from Amnesia spiritual Amia you are not fine you are not okay amen the Believers of long ago they were more serious than us who are living in the end time Daniel said by the number of books when he saw that the 70 years was expiring what did he see he went to see God In Prayer fasting supplication confessing repenting blessed be the name of the Lord because he knew that the time for going back was at hand amen 50 years ago God sending the prophet with a message of his coming as John the Baptist was said for him your message Believers are relaxing we are so busy say mothers blessed be the name of the Lord but God is still calling Amen Let Us tithe our time to God young people there's what we call prayer walk that time in prayer amen it is possible the Bible say the kingdom of God suffer violence and violent they take take it by force you have to press yourself in praise be to God [Applause] Amen Let Us rise and meet the challenge like there are people who have very serious but they very serious praying how will I stand with those people because the criteria is one amen through the same door there's no way the other person will get something through prayer and for you will bypass no way there is no option in this if New Birth is at the altar you must be at the altar either here or in the bush at your home praise be to God so there's no option There's No Escape there's nothing you can swap with fasting this is not like Muslims where you I can fast for brother Dixon no sir you fast for yourself take your burden to the Lord and leave it there carry your burden take them to the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord may God help us but one thing you have to know that God will bring it to pass God is just waiting for us to rise it's up to us where we live him that's where we find him blessed be the name of the Lord shall We rise on our feet in the message expectation as I'm finishing the prophet says that uh uh he fully obeyed and when he came to full obedience then God brought the blessings Abraham had to obey each and every instruction which God gave him he reached somewh where he told his servants stop here I am the Lord we are going up to worship and then after we shall come back not I will come back because he already knew the secret blessed be the name of the Lord but he believed that God will provide and would come back with his son and here the prophet tells us that he fully obeyed when when he came to full when he come to full obedience then God brought the blessings when he reached there tied the boy's hand got the knife he was he obeyed God fully then the angel of the Lord called him and showed him the sacrifice blessed be the name of the Lord so unless we obey fully there's no way amen the only way to go is obeying God fully and when we reach there then God will bring his blessings in our midst so we have a task to obey God to walk in full obedience God will give us that Grace amen God knows knows our insufficiency he knows that we are weak he knows that we are not able amen but in our weakness he called us regardless of our wickedness amen and we are working together with him is working his righteousness in us and God is very sure that by the end of the day we are going to be we are going to obey him fully blessed be the name of the Lord amen precious Lord Jesus we thank you for the few words we have shared Lord we know that you're Jehovah Gyra and Jesus were the same yesterday today and forever [Music] we are very sure that Lord you will see it tonight Lord father with those few words I pray that may the Holy Spirit give that word and direct it into our hearts Lord teach us to [Music] obey for the bible say that we sin and fell short of the Glory father we a bunch of rebels but Jesus you came down
