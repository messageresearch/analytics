[10:37] rude
[10:39] is that not so you see my children
[10:43] you know sometimes when preachers when
[10:44] we are preaching some sometimes you can
[10:47] give a wrong quote and
[10:49] speak a wrong name and place things
[10:51] wrongly but
[10:53] i believe each person who is spiritual
[10:55] they are able to read between the lines
[11:13] to me
[11:16] praise the name of the lord
[11:18] so
[11:20] it is
[11:21] the person who wrote this thank you for
[11:22] your correction
[11:26] um
[11:28] actually it was ruth
[11:30] that
[11:41] if you go to the book of ruth
[11:43] mitchell
[11:46] you'll notice in chapter four
[11:51] verse 21.
[11:53] salmon begat boys
[12:31] okay so
[12:36] now i have a question here the nature of
[12:38] the i know he says can i pay my time
[12:45] by helping the needy
[12:51] praise the lord
[12:53] i don't have a name
[12:56] according yeah
[12:58] to the person that uh asked this
[13:00] question
[13:03] but i want to say no you cannot
[13:06] know
[13:09] we as believers should help the need
[13:15] i should help the orphans
[13:18] and the widows
[13:31] i will give more details in the little
[13:33] videos i told you that i would be able
[13:35] to get along
[13:40] but if you go to malachi chapter 3
[13:46] are you there what you say yo
[13:49] malacca is the last book in the old
[13:51] testament
[13:54] says
[14:01] [Music]
[14:16] and he says in taipei's an offering
[14:19] baby
[14:21] where are you and then he says here cast
[14:22] with the cast for ye have robbed me even
[14:25] this whole nation naga mama called me
[14:42] that
[14:52] if i will not open your you the windows
[14:54] of heaven and pour you out a blessing
[14:56] that there shall not be room enough to
[14:58] receive it
[15:10] according to this verse
[15:12] he says bring all your tithes
[15:17] where are you supposed to bring it
[15:21] where why
[15:23] store house
[15:25] what is kept in the storehouse
[15:29] food meri not so super chilly
[15:34] so food is kept in the store cutting
[15:38] in this case
[15:48] so the word is
[15:50] the one that you receive from goddess
[15:52] storehouse
[15:56] whenever you come to church and you hear
[15:57] the word
[16:00] you are receiving food from the stores
[16:04] so then and now after receiving that
[16:06] food and medicine you are required as a
[16:09] believer to now pay your time
[16:15] so about two two things i'll talk about
[16:17] what are you interviewing you know
[16:19] i will not go into the details of
[16:21] tagging i'll give the details on the
[16:23] videos
[16:25] but for now i just want to
[16:27] and if you have another question out of
[16:28] this
[16:29] uh what i would say you again send it to
[16:31] me i will still address it on the video
[16:34] program
[17:29] you know but everyone receives income
[17:33] you see when you receive income maybe
[17:35] someone has given you a gift
[17:39] maybe you kept money on the bank and you
[17:41] accrued some interest
[17:45] and so this interest or whatever it is
[17:47] that you receive
[17:49] you give back to god
[17:52] as acknowledgement that the blessing has
[17:54] come from him
[18:01] i spoke i think about uh a few weeks ago
[18:03] i spoke on taithes and offerings
[18:08] the person that has asked this
[18:11] please go and listen to that
[18:16] now your tithe you pay your tithers to
[18:19] your church
[18:25] you see
[18:26] god had um levites in the old testament
[18:31] and these levites were men that did not
[18:34] get any inheritance
[18:39] god said don't do not worry you you you
[18:41] are mine
[18:45] and so you see your tribe the tribe of
[18:46] levi you you are mine
[18:49] and all the other tribes
[18:52] they were given inheritance
[19:36] other 10 to the high priest
[19:41] and of course the high priest now was
[19:42] standing in also for the lord
[19:46] to the levites
[19:48] and to the people
[19:50] of the delivered to in for the lord
[20:00] in other words we do not give our tithes
[20:03] to people
[20:04] it
[20:08] so when you for instance
[20:10] if you pay your tithe to me
[20:13] you don't give it to me
[20:15] as
[20:16] a gift over to chimpanzee you give it to
[20:19] me as though you've given it unto the
[20:21] lord
[20:24] recognition
[20:26] that you're recognizing me as a
[20:28] as your pastor
[20:32] and someone that god has placed there
[20:34] for you
[20:36] are you spiritual
[20:38] so now
[20:39] if i take that type money cutting entire
[20:42] sentence and i use it the wrong way
[20:45] that's none of your business
[21:14] from the very beginning we have been
[21:15] giving accountability of your funds
[21:22] that's how we've used it to get
[21:24] requested
[21:25] but
[21:25] there is no obligation for any person to
[21:27] account to you how we use
[21:54] [Music]
[21:55] if you want the details on this subject
[21:57] please go and listen to the someone i
[21:59] preached on tithes and offerings it's on
[22:01] youtube and also on the podcast
[22:09] to an evangelist
[22:10] [Music]
[22:12] someone is preaching on the road and
[22:14] you're like oh you're preaching so well
[22:16] and then you take your title
[22:23] if you have something to give him give
[22:24] him away if you have something to give
[22:27] the need to give them
[22:29] away but if you pay it to your church
[22:38] praise the name of the lord
[22:41] and um
[22:47] i wish i could go in detail and read you
[22:49] a few quotes here
[22:51] okay
[22:52] okay
[23:07] so that's why it's good for you to write
[23:08] your name so whatever you do
[23:13] but
[23:14] still i'll i'll give more details
[23:17] okay now i have another question here
[23:19] from brother sam oregon
[23:27] how can a person control his or her
[23:29] feelings maybe
[23:31] when tempted or
[23:33] maybe not
[23:34] oh
[23:49] how can a person control i think they
[23:50] mean if how can a person control
[23:53] his or her feelings
[23:58] when tempted or not
[24:02] why is that
[24:16] i think they are asking how can you have
[24:19] self-control
[24:25] you see self-control is not a gift
[24:30] self-control
[24:32] you can only attain it if you have the
[24:34] holocaust
[24:37] if you don't have the holy spirit
[24:39] you cannot have self-confidence
[24:46] uh i'll ask you a question
[24:48] many times
[24:50] you can do
[24:51] what's wrong with you
[24:52] and then
[24:53] you you say well from today
[24:57] i will never do this again
[25:13] [Music]
[25:27] okay
[25:28] and you will overcome what
[25:30] no one would why
[25:32] because you do not have self-control
[25:36] but you see in your control tower
[25:52] [Music]
[25:55] now it is
[25:56] what is on your soul a children
[25:58] is what is controlling you
[26:01] if it's the devil
[26:03] satan is controlling you
[26:06] if it's god
[26:08] is controlling
[26:09] now what is in your soul
[26:12] of us
[26:13] we are born with a mad soul twas
[26:22] we are born in a perverted
[26:34] i'm speaking about the seed of god
[26:43] [Music]
[27:04] we you can pick that from genesis
[27:08] we have the seed of god truly
[27:10] and the seed of the sabbath
[27:13] the seed of the serpent
[27:15] no matter what you do never walk all
[27:17] right no matter how you preach to them
[27:20] no matter how powerful a preacher is
[27:26] but they will be like a duck
[27:29] when it rains
[27:32] it will suck and soak in water
[27:36] and then after it finishes the rain
[27:38] just shake itself
[27:40] on it and then it will be dry again
[27:43] you see
[27:44] that is how it is very strong
[28:57] there are three stages of you of grace
[29:00] that god will take you through the way
[29:04] first thing you will do
[29:06] you will justify you
[29:09] when it justifies you
[29:28] [Music]
[29:38] will not
[30:00] [Music]
[30:59] people who are
[31:01] addicted to alcohol i ran to ramaniro
[31:05] you know they can say i will leave it
[31:07] because of some conviction
[31:10] so you will leave it for a while
[31:12] and after some time
[31:13] you go back again
[31:15] you leave it
[31:30] there is
[31:41] for the rest of your life
[31:43] but the only thing that changes you
[31:45] mentioned
[31:47] is what is on your control tower
[31:52] as you stay under the altar but it was
[31:55] hearing the word
[31:58] baptism after baptism nobody what would
[32:01] you say god working on you
[32:04] the word every time
[32:05] you say that coming to fellowship and
[32:07] hearing the word
[32:09] listen to the word
[32:12] hallelujah
[32:24] how does faith come
[32:38] to receive the holy ghost you only need
[32:40] to have faith
[32:52] [Music]
[33:08] so
[33:08] we continue living between desires
[33:36] we live
[34:05] questions would you be tempted
[34:08] oh yes
[34:10] but you can control it
[34:12] it's not you
[34:13] it is christ in europe
[34:16] the problem the reason why it is so hard
[34:17] for young people to live a christian
[34:19] life
[34:24] that's because they are trying to do it
[34:25] themselves
[34:28] you cannot do it by yourself
[34:31] you can't overcome anything by yourself
[34:35] the only thing you have to do is to
[34:36] yield to you
[34:38] where will you receive the holy ghost
[34:41] from that moment
[34:43] hallelujah he's on the control tower
[34:46] the one guiding you and leading you yeah
[34:50] when you are tempted never he's your
[34:52] strength
[34:53] and he gives you victory in every
[34:55] temptation
[34:58] hallelujah
[35:00] the answer to this the only way you can
[35:02] control receive the holy ghost
[35:10] praise the name of the lord
[35:15] and then
[35:16] and then
[35:18] one person asked for one person talked
[35:20] about the banner
[35:22] again
[35:23] said how have you been
[35:26] um
[35:27] how are
[35:28] you yeah i've been fine
[35:31] since i got saved
[35:34] and i was filled with the holocaust not
[35:35] just my mom took i've been you know
[35:37] fighting with two dogs in me
[35:42] the black
[35:51] [Music]
[35:56] adult naga my worry same when zeruko it
[35:59] will overcome the white house
[36:01] but if you feed the white one
[36:03] neighborhood
[36:04] it will defeat the black people
[36:07] so if you feed on the world category
[36:10] and prayer no server you receive
[36:12] strength of a man
[36:14] to overcome the flesh
[36:16] but if you are
[36:17] listening to what let me use whatever it
[36:19] is
[36:21] i'm going toward the parties
[36:24] all your friends are not
[36:38] then
[37:02] [Music]
[37:15] [Music]
[37:20] foreign
[37:51] please the question is
[37:53] drugs is it bad to use drugs
[37:58] in the case it is for a good reason
[38:02] so my question
[38:17] so now anything drugs
[38:21] we have a doctor here a medical doctor
[38:23] when a truly name is
[38:25] i believe if any drug
[38:30] was prescribed to you or for you in the
[38:33] hospital
[38:38] it is not bad to use it
[38:41] most of the drugs
[38:43] many of the drugs we use in the hospital
[38:48] you know actually most of them
[38:50] are gonna really come from herbs
[38:54] nancy's that's true doctor peter what's
[38:56] your chili
[39:25] so
[39:26] who made weed katyani according to god
[39:29] made with casual korean jagger
[39:32] right chili is that true
[39:34] god made with cattle
[39:37] but what happens to people
[39:40] the devil
[39:55] montgomery didn't know where again there
[39:56] is that but it is the devil satani that
[39:59] perverts what god has created
[40:06] is it satanic and evil have sex
[40:22] young people you
[41:07] how can something be holy in one context
[41:09] and be evil in another chin
[41:18] because it did not or was not done
[41:20] according to the rules
[41:21] [Music]
[41:25] so now when you ask me is it bad to use
[41:27] drugs
[41:31] in case it's for a good reason
[41:36] if
[41:38] the first question i'll ask is what type
[41:39] of drug cambodia that are going to
[41:41] charge if it's medical drugs
[41:44] if it's for medical reasons
[41:48] then i don't even think it's a question
[41:50] because it's prescribed by a doctor and
[41:52] it's going to be in limits
[42:00] whereby it will not become addictive
[42:08] but if you are going to take
[42:10] a drug like weed for example
[42:20] or something like that already
[42:23] and someone has convinced you that you
[42:24] see this
[42:28] when you take it you will
[42:40] no please answer me you're honest with
[42:42] yourself
[42:54] don't go deep into the thing just
[42:56] understand my
[43:06] yes
[43:07] it's a good reason
[43:09] so the person asked
[43:50] the scripture says that we should not um
[43:53] we should not fashion ourselves after
[43:55] the world a challenge
[44:00] if it's not a healthy reason
[44:02] to simultaneously if it's a healthy
[44:04] reason
[44:05] then the doctor will have to prescribe
[44:06] them
[44:09] but if it's not a healthy reason
[44:11] oh yeah there's a healthy reason
[44:13] i don't believe you should go and begin
[44:15] taking with securities
[44:19] according to your own
[44:21] prescription cutting gorgeous saliva
[44:24] until january that is not right
[44:27] because it's going to end up in
[44:30] um
[44:32] in getting addicted to the drug
[44:43] and sometimes you're going to be really
[44:45] low oh don't know what to everyone say
[44:47] don't take it
[44:48] take
[45:16] i don't know it's mixed with his blood
[45:18] or something yeah two guys say that
[45:21] he got the name
[45:22] so the doctor told him
[45:25] you should never leave it
[45:30] because if you leave it you will die
[45:35] now if that uncle was a member of my
[45:37] child
[45:40] i would pray for them
[45:42] for them
[45:43] to leave it and be alive
[45:47] so the doctor can as well prescribe
[45:49] something that is not really good for
[45:50] you as a christian a christian must have
[45:52] a spiritual thinking filter um
[46:13] i'm not sure i'm not a medical person
[46:15] but i think it has a lot of weed in it
[46:16] or something
[46:17] some of those
[46:19] elements
[46:20] and it's very addictive
[46:25] so um
[46:26] as a believer
[46:28] if you're taking something like that but
[46:30] when you achieve towards you even by the
[46:32] fact that you are taking it no comments
[46:35] it shows that you are not believing that
[46:36] god can heal you
[46:39] why would you take something with such a
[46:40] side effect and then you're like oh no
[46:42] it's okay as long as the doctor is
[46:44] prescribed
[46:51] it's the devil that perverts what god
[46:53] has made is
[47:06] what god has made to make it look like
[47:20] [Music]
[47:23] parents of evil
[47:31] it may not appear to be evil
[47:35] it may not be evil
[47:36] but as
[47:50] once
[48:11] [Music]
[48:19] how many understand that but still get
[48:21] this so i believe
[48:24] it's um
[48:26] not right for believers to take
[48:32] drugs if i was the one and i was
[48:35] prescribed to take weeds
[48:42] to get out of a problem
[48:46] i would have to put food to our test
[48:50] i would say god if you do not heal me
[48:53] i'm pregnant but if i take weed when you
[48:56] and you're going to get out of my
[48:57] problem
[49:01] then you would have to prove to me
[49:02] whether you are living
[49:07] i don't know how many would do that
[49:12] i believe our god is not
[49:14] so little
[49:17] that you would have to stoop so low
[49:19] um
[49:29] in order to go according to the systems
[49:30] of the world
[49:34] so brother i believe when you said drugs
[49:36] i meant believe you said weed because
[49:38] what we they talked about
[49:40] and those uh
[49:56] the name
[50:08] foreign
[50:16] what can i do
[50:18] when in school
[50:20] and people are praying the rosary while
[50:23] kneeling
[50:24] am i supposed to kneel like them um
[50:38] i would say congratulations you cannot
[50:41] worship idols
[50:44] to be politically correct
[50:47] [Music]
[50:50] you cannot
[50:52] as a child of god women don't have your
[50:54] own standards
[50:57] you can do anything
[50:59] but you cannot bow before idols
[51:04] if they let them kneel all the people
[51:33] praise the name of the lord
[51:35] you cannot knew before i don't have
[51:37] amelia you cannot kneel before the gods
[51:40] of rome
[51:43] if it's in your home
[51:45] you have to respectfully make it clear
[51:48] orinochito
[52:01] [Music]
[52:16] where i come from geneva most of my
[52:18] family members are not believers
[52:23] so if they invite me
[52:25] peter they make sure there is no alcohol
[52:59] if anything stands between me and god
[53:02] shall never see me
[53:04] i take god as my prayer
[53:08] is number one in my life
[53:11] everything else is
[53:27] [Music]
[53:40] god bless you church i'm about mexican
[53:43] sir i have a lot of because i want to
[53:44] read for each question but
[53:46] i'm just going to go through as much as
[53:48] i can and and then now i will go through
[53:50] each of them with them you know whatever
[53:52] you can understand
[54:06] [Music]
[54:08] i don't understand the question why
[54:12] it's people
[54:14] oh this this one needed to have some
[54:15] more grammar
[54:18] why
[54:19] it's people company about the
[54:22] believers to stay with unbelievers
[54:27] they understand the question
[54:32] why
[54:33] people
[54:36] why is it people company
[54:41] about the believers
[54:46] why is it that people complain about the
[54:48] believers is that the question
[54:50] about
[55:01] it's easy to stay with unbelievers
[55:24] why did the world
[55:27] act
[55:28] reject why the world
[55:30] believers
[55:33] is it good when you marry
[55:36] an unbeliever
[55:39] before getting
[55:41] this message
[55:42] of the hour
[55:54] okay
[55:55] now maybe you're asking why
[55:58] do
[55:58] the the what does the word reject
[56:00] believers russians
[56:03] it is simple christ was rejected so they
[56:05] will reject us
[56:09] one thing about the world and see you
[56:11] engage
[56:12] if
[56:13] you do what they want
[56:17] you are their friends
[56:24] no other thing to say
[56:28] you see you cannot if everybody is going
[56:30] to
[56:31] academy for example if everybody is
[56:34] going for a disco
[56:36] i mean
[56:39] and they are going to go down ok
[56:42] ok and they are
[56:45] and you
[56:47] are also going with them now
[56:50] do you think you are going to dress
[56:52] as you dress when you are coming to
[56:54] church and go with them
[57:10] but for you to fit in them
[57:14] you would have to dress like them or you
[57:15] know
[57:18] you would have to dress a trouser oh
[57:19] yeah
[57:20] or a meniscus
[57:22] if you're a young man
[57:24] you would have
[57:27] you would have to um
[57:29] you know these days even younger men are
[57:31] using makeup
[57:35] they are putting pins in their ears
[57:37] you must have to stress what the world
[57:50] but if you stand on your ground as a
[57:52] child of god
[58:13] rejects
[58:14] the devils and the demons in the world
[58:16] again satan the name is the demons in
[58:18] the world let me imagine fear
[58:27] [Music]
[58:49] the most curses
[58:51] being influenced
[58:56] hallelujah
[58:57] how can if you are not a cockroach well
[58:59] that will change how can you accompany
[59:02] with
[59:02] cockroaches oh he's not your beta navy
[59:04] angel is it possible
[59:07] to love darkness
[59:09] [Music]
[59:10] they hate lights
[59:12] and then you find yourself with them
[59:15] i'm changing them
[59:34] your friend that you love so much
[59:37] sure he loves you so much
[59:39] let them hear the word and change
[59:42] you okay that therefore in them has to
[59:44] die or you're standing i'm really mad
[59:45] you know but if it cannot
[59:47] food then there is a problem sorry
[59:50] if you continue to accompany with them
[59:54] and then is it good
[59:57] when you marry an unbeliever before
[1:00:00] getting the message of the hour
[1:00:09] i think the question should be
[1:00:41] now if you divorce one it will become
[1:00:43] his wife
[1:00:47] i hope the brother will say that amen
[1:00:48] doesn't want to matter too
[1:00:57] [Music]
[1:01:36] and so god puts that under the blood of
[1:01:38] her
[1:01:39] baby
[1:01:42] whatever you did in the past
[1:01:46] god does not remember that
[1:01:48] in in the in the years when you did not
[1:01:50] know the truth
[1:01:53] and so there are some scars
[1:01:54] [Music]
[1:01:59] for instance if a girl believes the
[1:02:01] message um
[1:02:03] and she hears what i preach
[1:02:05] in the morning
[1:02:08] that she has to be a virtuous woman
[1:02:11] to repent my husband before marriage
[1:02:13] is for not to be no queen and yes
[1:02:17] and oh what can i do now got incorrect
[1:02:19] yeah i was i did not know that noticed
[1:02:22] without knowing now because but now i've
[1:02:25] believed that the indicator is there the
[1:02:26] scout will remain it can cover it just
[1:02:29] signal because you have repented away
[1:02:32] do not make you a virgin
[1:02:54] [Music]
[1:03:04] if someone was you know moving around in
[1:03:06] the world and they get hiv
[1:03:11] and they believe
[1:03:13] this can remain in couples can god heal
[1:03:17] them
[1:03:18] oh yes
[1:03:20] we have testimonies of people that god
[1:03:21] has healed
[1:03:22] jesus
[1:03:24] on principle i'm saying this
[1:03:30] when someone has several wives and
[1:03:32] believes that scar will remain with them
[1:03:34] they will remain with the wives but it's
[1:03:35] a scar in their lives
[1:03:43] and they can't be beacons are they
[1:03:45] in koni they can't be passed
[1:03:49] why
[1:03:51] because
[1:03:52] of that in their life
[1:03:56] says
[1:04:25] neighborhood
[1:04:26] and you had a girlfriend
[1:04:29] you repent of that
[1:04:32] and leave them ah

[1:06:18] and marry an unbeliever
[1:06:28] attacker

[1:06:35] word

[1:11:10] i would rather why can't
[1:11:13] you preach to them
[1:11:15] let god convert them again
[1:11:18] and then wait
[1:11:21] if they are really converted
[1:11:36] [Music]
[1:11:43] in many circumstances
[1:11:45] they do not have an idea to marry them
[1:11:48] when they were preaching to them
[1:12:03] [Music]
[1:12:17] maybe one of them may be your wife
[1:12:49] when he went
[1:12:51] after one month
[1:12:53] he had read it
[1:12:54] he realized it was the truth
[1:12:57] he came back now come out and he told he
[1:12:59] was around for some time
[1:13:01] not serious but he was around
[1:13:28] and this brother organ is now a preacher
[1:13:30] of the message
[1:13:34] and he's married to this sister yeah
[1:13:36] what's up
[1:13:37] and they have about i think three
[1:13:38] children now no zakatibadi mobile now
[1:13:40] and they are both having gone they never
[1:13:42] never went to zacato under so sister did
[1:13:44] not do pcm
[1:13:53] [Music]
[1:13:59] there is no circumstance my brother
[1:14:02] why do you want better yet
[1:14:04] with examples
[1:14:07] no this is another question
[1:14:09] with examples
[1:14:10] from the bible what punishment has god
[1:14:12] ever given to a church or a pastor or a
[1:14:16] prophet
[1:14:17] who misuses all mismanages the tithe and
[1:14:20] offerings of the church musumba go to
[1:14:23] what everywhere where are you
[1:14:25] go to what they've you know
[1:14:41] who misuses all mismanagers the tithe
[1:14:43] and offering for the church
[1:14:47] now i believe my brother and i have your
[1:14:48] name here but i'll not mention it
[1:14:51] and you really have guts to put your
[1:14:53] name on on such questions
[1:14:59] you see
[1:15:00] i believe you've got to ask that because
[1:15:03] you found that we are mismanaging funds
[1:15:05] here
[1:15:32] uh servants of god who mismanaged the
[1:15:34] fact
[1:15:36] that
[1:16:00] [Music]
[1:16:18] and as
[1:16:33] know executed one and
[1:16:35] when he gives his word well you'll get a
[1:16:37] chicken but it holds you accountable
[1:16:42] he holds you accountable
[1:16:45] now some people think what um
[1:16:48] that's pastors who preach this message
[1:16:51] and the people will not be judged
[1:16:54] but i tell you what
[1:16:56] every money you receive for descendants
[1:16:59] of foreign
[1:17:16] and we shall give accountability
[1:17:19] now those of you in my family know me
[1:17:21] very well
[1:17:23] i believe in accountability
[1:17:26] ask for budgets
[1:17:34] but i believe all the members of my
[1:17:35] family have come to learn and appreciate
[1:17:37] it is there a member of the family
[1:17:40] you must learn
[1:17:42] accountability
[1:17:58] [Music]
[1:18:05] [Music]
[1:18:19] [Music]
[1:18:22] praise the name of the lord
[1:18:30] some of these questions i'll spend some
[1:18:31] good time on them and give more
[1:18:33] prescriptions
[1:18:37] brother used to say the statement read
[1:18:39] between the lines
[1:18:45] what does it mean
[1:18:47] now that means that not everything he
[1:18:49] says is the way he says it
[1:18:51] is
[1:18:52] saint if you're never
[1:19:06] if we speak on
[1:19:08] on if i can preach on the serpent seed
[1:19:13] without mentioning the act that was done
[1:19:17] but then again you have to read between
[1:19:19] the lines now you got to go you're not
[1:19:20] taking
[1:19:26] [Music]
[1:19:28] many times i've been preaching and i
[1:19:29] said
[1:19:32] the scripture says
[1:19:49] then we go back again to genesis
[1:19:57] how many have read between the lines
[1:20:01] so according to you what did you do
[1:20:07] did you read between the lines
[1:20:10] and what did you see
[1:20:14] kawaii
[1:20:18] who else has another answer
[1:20:21] yes

[1:24:07] yes
[1:24:17] yes
[1:24:19] so
[1:24:19] you've been in a situation
[1:24:23] where you are in a place
[1:24:43] to be actually in your mind be removing
[1:24:45] the words that you now our mind and
[1:24:47] those are yours not sleep
[1:24:49] our spirit homeopathy is our mind oh
[1:24:52] you've got faith in those are your faith
[1:24:54] and
[1:24:56] some people dream other stones
[1:25:02] the subconscious and the consciousness
[1:25:09] and each of us have those
[1:25:25] one of them i know that i know in my
[1:25:27] life is my wife
[1:25:31] you can be there talking
[1:25:34] and then in a moment
[1:25:36] she explains to you what you will see
[1:25:38] now
[1:25:53] in her subconscious
[1:26:21] which take it now that's the same thing
[1:26:24] a vision is the same thing that happens
[1:26:26] when you are dreaming
[1:26:30] that here your conscious has to go to
[1:26:33] sleep and you already want
[1:27:03] mechanisms worshiping never sins they
[1:27:06] see things which come to pass
[1:27:08] others you know there are many different
[1:27:10] things
[1:27:11] that we see in our subconscious
[1:27:14] and others don't really dream
[1:27:28] there is something here that the bible
[1:27:29] says what do i achieve on a bible check
[1:27:32] i want to read it quickly for you
[1:27:36] in the book of uh
[1:27:38] 12 romans 12.
[1:27:43] and be not conformed to this world but
[1:27:46] be you transformed by the renewing of
[1:27:48] your mind
[1:27:49] that he may prove
[1:27:51] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:27:53] perfect will of god
[1:27:56] is
[1:28:02] [Music]
[1:28:24] and the only thing that can renew our
[1:28:25] mind is the word
[1:28:41] our mind begins to think on the things
[1:28:43] of god cutting then the words that you
[1:28:45] know what's that means
[1:28:46] to show you what i'm saying
[1:28:48] and how it is connected to dreams
[1:28:51] is
[1:28:52] um
[1:28:53] put music take a call or a nimba and go
[1:28:57] to bed way back
[1:28:59] when you sleep welcome you will begin to
[1:29:02] dream those things as if you were
[1:29:03] actually it is actually in real reality
[1:29:08] um
[1:29:50] your mind
[1:30:32] root of yamun is god communicating to me
[1:30:39] it's just to show you the same thing
[1:30:42] says when you die
[1:30:44] you don't
[1:30:47] you remain the change same person that
[1:30:49] was it
[1:30:50] to you
[1:30:51] so now if you were a roper or a thief
[1:30:55] when you die and walk out of this body
[1:30:57] oh nobody will be good you're not
[1:30:59] going to become a good man don't get the
[1:31:01] out tomorrow
[1:31:02] remain at fifa rover
[1:31:05] and he will go to hell as a thief
[1:31:08] and even your mind in hell will be a
[1:31:10] seat
[1:31:13] until you come before the white
[1:31:28] something
[1:31:38] [Music]
[1:31:44] [Music]
[1:32:03] [Music]
[1:32:11] in your life and wash your consciousness
[1:32:17] the moment you receive the holy ghost
[1:32:21] you hear the word of god
[1:32:37] [Music]
[1:33:21] did they nowhere get up and when you eat
[1:33:23] too much
[1:33:25] you dream things
[1:33:26] and in an emergency of dreams then
[1:33:28] there's also a lot of um
[1:33:29] a lot of discrepancies
[1:33:34] okay
[1:33:43] but until someone's conscious is washed
[1:33:46] and cleansed by the word of god and
[1:33:47] their mind renewed or
[1:34:03] katya i'm not gonna go call a baby into
[1:34:04] every night yeah he says when he the
[1:34:06] holocaust comes
[1:34:08] he will do what he's called show you
[1:34:11] things together
[1:34:12] gave him to every kingdom i believe he
[1:34:14] can do that in dreams
[1:34:16] so
[1:34:21] these dreams are only showing you the
[1:34:24] status of your spiritual life now
[1:34:27] embedded
[1:34:58] time
[1:35:00] that these dreams
[1:35:01] have changed
[1:35:04] praise the lord come here my question is
[1:35:06] about marriage
[1:35:10] and you don't have a name
[1:35:14] as far as seeking god's kingdom and his
[1:35:16] righteousness
[1:35:17] first are concerned his marriage also
[1:35:20] god is righteousness
[1:36:25] there are many things that married
[1:36:27] people do what would have been to know
[1:36:29] india but from baby baby that are not
[1:36:30] expected of them to do
[1:36:32] this
[1:36:34] why right it's because they need to
[1:36:37] overcome them
[1:36:40] will you overcome them
[1:36:42] i need a special relationship with god
[1:36:47] so i believe before you get married
[1:37:05] when you don't have a head coach
[1:37:10] you don't come to church
[1:37:12] you don't pay your tithe no
[1:37:14] you're not a serious christian tell him
[1:37:16] i just uh
[1:37:18] you know up and down oh yeah i was doing
[1:37:19] what you were unstable

[1:37:25] and now how would you have a a a a a a
[1:37:27] family
[1:37:30] and guide your wife
[1:37:32] be
[1:37:46] if you cannot receive a
[1:37:49] breakthrough in prayer now before you
[1:37:50] get married
[1:37:56] so you have to break through before you
[1:37:57] get married

[1:38:13] is the correct way of marrying that god

[1:44:36] don't
[1:44:38] after everything has been done now
[1:44:39] you're not told me
[1:44:41] sisters are coming you're coming to
[1:44:42] church
[1:44:44] in a youth meeting like this
[1:45:09] hallelujah amen opening your eyes
[1:45:13] does not mean lasting africa
[1:45:27] for a younger lady
[1:45:40] some of you don't get worse because
[1:45:42] you're looking for the wrong thing
[1:46:13] you are looking for the character of
[1:46:15] christ in a woman
[1:46:20] you know what to look for
[1:46:23] in balancing does she
[1:46:34] does she have sacredness around her yeah
[1:46:37] as a woman
[1:46:44] [Music]
[1:46:50] because i don't want to dress a woman
[1:46:52] who will dress like this and then
[1:46:53] attract other men
[1:46:59] i want to marry someone who dresses like
[1:47:01] a believer
[1:47:05] if you see a boy a girl with all the
[1:47:08] americans and everything and yeah i
[1:47:09] don't know the meaning is just not that
[1:47:11] man is not also saved
[1:47:20] yes never god said god and saved himself
[1:47:24] he's just lying to us
[1:47:26] you show who you are by what you married
[1:47:32] you see then
[1:47:34] then so you begin looking out for
[1:47:36] christians
[1:47:39] if she's beautiful
[1:47:41] praise god how can i hear myself
[1:47:43] but if she's not oh that's simulanji
[1:47:46] that's okay
[1:47:48] as long as the character
[1:48:07] sometimes some people marry some people
[1:48:09] and they they begin splashing them all
[1:48:12] over what's happened you youtube oh my
[1:48:14] queen oh my beauty and then when you
[1:48:16] look at
[1:49:55] right because many of the times
[1:49:58] if a young man came to me
[1:50:02] the next part i would tell them
[1:50:04] go ahead and talk to us
[1:50:07] you know
[1:50:08] if they have not yet spoken well that
[1:50:10] time now you'll get her you know i
[1:50:11] always find out when they come to me
[1:50:13] after speaking together out there
[1:50:15] usually it doesn't end where i have
[1:50:16] found that in minecraft
[1:50:19] [Music]
[1:50:36] who came to me one time
[1:50:40] no one can know who they are
[1:50:42] so and this has happened on several
[1:50:44] occasions
[1:50:46] and he spoke to me
[1:50:49] i'm interested in sisterhood
[1:50:51] [Music]
[1:50:59] [Music]
[1:51:03] but when the brother was talking with
[1:51:05] the sister
[1:51:08] sister was behaving as if she was
[1:51:09] singing
[1:51:13] and that's where the problem
[1:51:14] was
[1:51:15] so usually come to the pastor for cancer
[1:51:18] or
[1:51:32] can you help me can you talk to her on
[1:51:33] my behalf
[1:51:37] you know someone asked me to talk to him
[1:51:42] said brother if you cannot talk to it
[1:51:44] means you're not ready for marriage
[1:52:00] if they refuse you
[1:52:02] now
[1:52:03] just gather yourself up
[1:52:05] away
[1:52:07] and wait for another opportunity
[1:52:11] but if they are the right ones for you
[1:52:14] they can never
[1:52:21] and of course when you start talking
[1:52:23] then you go into courtship
[1:52:27] at some point the pastor gets to know
[1:52:29] him
[1:52:32] then uh
[1:52:33] you announce your engagement
[1:52:37] when agreements are met
[1:52:40] again and
[1:52:41] then ultimately that will end up into
[1:52:43] our wedding
[1:52:47] i think i've answered that
[1:52:50] question number three i need to know
[1:52:53] and to do the rightful way of attaining
[1:52:55] a sister
[1:52:57] [Music]
[1:53:01] because i wish to pursue one come on
[1:53:06] [Laughter]
[1:53:13] i i love this
[1:53:15] i wish to pursue one i will get there
[1:53:21] rather go and pursue
[1:53:22] naked
[1:53:35] i have heard that it is allowed for
[1:53:37] sisters to to do makeups
[1:53:39] it
[1:53:52] themselves on their weddings
[1:53:58] by wearing whatever they want
[1:54:01] and painting themselves
[1:54:03] is it true or false
[1:54:06] my wife never did that
[1:54:08] and we had a beautiful word
[1:54:14] and that's all i can say
[1:54:17] can you forgive someone who tries to
[1:54:19] fail your life pastor
[1:54:29] [Music]
[1:54:59] so
[1:55:00] uh
[1:55:02] yeah the bible tells us to forgive
[1:55:03] everybody together to certainly win but
[1:55:05] i need to understand they need to go
[1:55:07] together what circumstances
[1:55:10] that are surrounding this case i i don't
[1:55:12] know what to say i don't know what
[1:55:13] you're going through cementing my
[1:55:15] childhood
[1:55:16] please come and see me
[1:55:19] okay now there is another question here
[1:55:21] okay our time is up can i can i continue
[1:55:23] a little bit more
[1:55:26] how many say but
[1:55:27] i can just close now and we'll do this
[1:55:29] on video but if you want me to continue
[1:55:33] [Music]
[1:55:44] be
[1:55:47] okay how many said 30 minutes
[1:55:51] all right so let us continue for 30
[1:55:52] minutes
[1:55:55] um
[1:55:57] this is another brother okay here's
[1:55:59] another question here
[1:56:01] the bible talks about a time for
[1:56:03] everything
[1:56:07] and it is said that when you jump a
[1:56:09] stage that child would and that you can
[1:56:12] be one to go back
[1:56:21] don't you think one needs to involve
[1:56:24] himself or herself in what she or he is
[1:56:26] supposed to do at the time
[1:56:30] don't you think you know
[1:56:32] you know
[1:56:34] how do we know that it is time for this
[1:56:36] and that to together
[1:56:39] you know but you
[1:56:40] know and he was quoting ecclesiastes
[1:56:43] chapter three verse one you ever done
[1:56:45] um
[1:56:47] i do not know on the on what perspective
[1:56:53] but it is true there is time for
[1:56:55] everything
[1:56:59] there are times whatever you say that
[1:57:01] and i regret that i can
[1:57:03] these days i've tried my best i'm still
[1:57:05] trying to find those times but it's
[1:57:08] becoming increasingly hard
[1:57:14] i would go in um
[1:57:16] a bush somewhere what would he say that
[1:57:18] when again
[1:57:20] and just get into those thickets
[1:57:44] there are many things that have come
[1:57:44] into my life that have made it
[1:57:46] increasingly hard for me to be the way i
[1:57:48] was then
[1:58:04] parked somewhere on the roadside and i
[1:58:07] entered into a bush
[1:58:13] they would be even they may bring the
[1:58:14] news people to investigate
[1:58:18] they may think that i'm going to maybe
[1:58:20] kill someone
[1:58:23] you understand what i'm saying
[1:58:26] there are things that you can do
[1:58:27] sometimes
[1:58:29] [Music]
[1:58:30] at some levels in your life
[1:58:48] you will notice that you do not have the
[1:58:50] opportunities you had then
[1:58:56] if i say i'm going away for several days
[1:58:58] my wife will say but we need you in
[1:58:59] gangnam
[1:59:56] hi
[2:00:08] the person asking this question
[2:00:10] she was a child
[2:00:12] he said something that that when you
[2:00:15] skip something it comes back again to
[2:00:16] you that one turns into another corner
[2:00:24] as if
[2:00:25] to say that
[2:00:26] if
[2:00:27] you don't play football now you'll play
[2:00:30] it when you get older
[2:00:36] something will come that you didn't
[2:00:51] i believe as a christian ticket is
[2:01:21] so i gave up
[2:01:22] and so i lost interest in the shower and
[2:01:25] i've never been a footballer
[2:01:27] i've never been a football fan
[2:01:30] i did some games but when i got saved i
[2:01:32] left
[2:02:03] why
[2:02:09] believers
[2:02:13] believers are not supposed to gamble
[2:02:16] gambling or
[2:02:17] is a sign
[2:02:19] and symbol of listeners
[2:02:24] when you go to america now
[2:02:26] america the god of america catholic
[2:02:28] america
[2:02:30] is a woman
[2:02:51] [Music]
[2:02:58] and we should even collect money like
[2:02:59] that
[2:03:03] they are doing it now
[2:03:05] but even then
[2:03:06] in america america they used to preach
[2:03:08] against
[2:03:10] the bible says
[2:03:12] we should not fashion ourselves after
[2:03:14] the world baby but it would not find a
[2:03:16] gangnam game so most of these things are
[2:03:19] really entertainment
[2:03:22] entertainment you do now
[2:03:24] you must make sure you know that you're
[2:03:26] not being overtaken
[2:03:31] praise the name of the lord remember
[2:03:33] and maybe i'll be giving more details on
[2:03:35] that and all the histories of some of
[2:03:37] these things
[2:03:40] we're
[2:03:43] there's some
[2:03:44] games and entertainment that is not
[2:03:47] not bad
[2:03:52] and i'm not saying that believers should
[2:03:53] not have any sort of entertainment
[2:04:02] but you must watch
[2:04:05] what type of entertainment do you engage
[2:04:06] in
[2:04:08] yourself
[2:04:14] right so
[2:04:16] i have another question here
[2:04:20] is ruth still here lucy
[2:04:30] why god loves people but he wants people
[2:04:32] to save
[2:04:35] really i'll need her to
[2:04:36] clarify to save him or to serve them i
[2:04:39] don't really understand i need ask
[2:04:44] okay
[2:04:47] i was asked this question
[2:04:49] by one of the my denominational friends
[2:04:55] i need clarification on this verse
[2:05:17] at the hand of every beast will i
[2:05:19] require it and at the hand of man and at
[2:05:22] the hand of every man's brother will i
[2:05:23] require the life of man
[2:05:36] [Music]
[2:06:25] [Music]
[2:06:45] [Music]
[2:06:56] study of this scripture i don't
[2:06:58] understand the context
[2:07:01] but
[2:07:02] the scripture that comes to my mind
[2:07:04] right now
[2:07:08] is that if there is somebody
[2:07:13] talking about requiring
[2:07:15] blood on your head
[2:07:20] someone who helped me remind me that
[2:07:22] scripture
[2:07:23] got
[2:07:28] yes that might as well be
[2:07:30] by itself
[2:07:32] verse 5 might mean something else i'll
[2:07:34] need to have a deeper set on that but
[2:07:36] now there is another scripture
[2:07:39] that i wanted to look at
[2:07:41] already
[2:07:46] okay i also don't see it quickly here
[2:07:47] but it says if
[2:07:49] you see someone doing wrong chicken
[2:07:52] [Music]
[2:07:56] their blood will be required upon your
[2:07:58] head
[2:08:02] so that's the scripture that is coming
[2:08:03] close to this but i need to study um
[2:08:06] i'll surely deal with this on the video
[2:08:14] the question was why
[2:08:16] god
[2:08:17] needs
[2:08:18] blood of human lives this is not
[2:08:20] interpret your interpretation of this
[2:08:22] verse
[2:08:23] the person he is asking the question was
[2:08:25] why does god need blood of human lives
[2:08:34] i do not believe that god is demanding
[2:08:37] for human life
[2:08:41] i remember one day i was preaching and i
[2:08:42] said god requires blood
[2:08:47] yet
[2:08:48] the only
[2:08:49] he sacrifices never
[2:08:51] asked for is human life
[2:08:55] of christ
[2:08:57] so i don't think that's the
[2:08:58] interpretation but i need to
[2:09:00] if you are it would have done me well
[2:09:02] who asked this question i never said she
[2:09:04] was a chin are you here for anyone
[2:09:07] okay so
[2:09:09] uh i will need your name can you put
[2:09:10] your name on take a kid
[2:09:13] i will need to be sure to send you the
[2:09:15] answer yeah
[2:09:20] all right so there's another question
[2:09:21] here
[2:09:30] no i don't believe they are lost okay i
[2:09:33] i will not just justice to this one
[2:09:35] again because i want to deal with them a
[2:09:37] little more
[2:09:38] but let's go a little over it okay
[2:09:41] and i love the questions you asked by
[2:09:43] the gideon they're quite deep as well
[2:09:44] says what did jesus mean when he said
[2:09:47] that
[2:09:49] why did what did jesus mean when he say
[2:09:51] that the last the last shall come
[2:09:54] fast and the first last
[2:10:10] [Music]
[2:10:19] another place in scripture where he
[2:10:20] speaks of
[2:10:22] those that we are fast
[2:10:23] and those that were lost but they all
[2:10:26] received the same reward result
[2:10:34] and speaking of this we can look at the
[2:10:35] church edges
[2:10:38] from the very first church
[2:10:44] [Music]
[2:10:52] but the question is he was a teacher
[2:10:54] would they receive the reward yes
[2:10:58] they will receive the right name
[2:11:00] but
[2:11:01] we which are alive father and remain
[2:11:05] we are the last one father
[2:11:08] to come in we are the 11th hour workers
[2:11:11] father because
[2:11:13] they are the last bride to enter
[2:11:15] my opinion
[2:11:18] we complete everything
[2:11:20] the full revelation of the word
[2:11:32] here's what the scripture says we shall
[2:11:34] not hinder them that are asleep yakuza
[2:11:50] and remain
[2:11:53] we shall be caught up to the equality
[2:11:55] one to meet
[2:11:56] with the lord together with them in the
[2:11:58] end
[2:12:02] so
[2:12:03] but i know there is another aspect of
[2:12:05] that question and i'll get to it
[2:12:07] uh later
[2:12:12] how about if you
[2:12:16] you vow
[2:12:17] to the girl friend
[2:12:57] it's just like the many vowels we make
[2:13:58] i want to tell you
[2:14:00] christ sets you free from all those vows
[2:14:03] that you put in there
[2:14:07] is that a man
[2:14:09] so if you vote
[2:14:39] organa gideon
[2:14:41] vows to my sister receiver
[2:14:46] coming from your
[2:14:49] village
[2:14:52] and for her to yeah
[2:14:56] her father he has a v
[2:15:00] and he is displeased
[2:15:03] the bible says
[2:15:05] he has a right i know you tell her you
[2:15:08] will not marry
[2:15:09] me
[2:15:11] now
[2:15:12] according to the bible bible
[2:15:15] she is set free from that
[2:15:20] because the father refused
[2:15:24] you understand which target now if the
[2:15:26] father physical father can do that
[2:15:31] how much more god i'll take her to one
[2:15:33] that is singing and they set you free
[2:15:35] from vowels that you made
[2:15:38] before you came to the knowledge of the
[2:15:40] truth
[2:15:41] are you going to remain with your ears
[2:15:42] because you had made a vow
[2:15:46] you were actually set free from
[2:15:48] faith
[2:15:52] amen
[2:15:55] pastor is it possible for a person
[2:15:57] filled with the holy ghost to get a
[2:15:59] demon in him
[2:16:13] just like somebody asking me children
[2:16:16] can you get
[2:16:29] possessing demons in you
[2:16:44] so if you think you have demons in you
[2:16:47] you don't have the holy ghost
[2:16:50] and you need to
[2:16:51] be delivered
[2:16:53] and receive the holy ghost
[2:16:56] right
[2:16:57] what if i like an unbeliever who is well
[2:17:00] corrected
[2:17:08] well
[2:17:09] and i sent another brother to preach to
[2:17:11] her cathy marco organized
[2:17:16] [Music]
[2:18:16] [Music]
[2:18:22] is the brother
[2:18:37] and for him to even be wise enough
[2:18:41] not to express it at all
[2:18:44] and preach to her now what do you think
[2:18:46] she believes
[2:18:48] and because they are already friends
[2:19:01] if you ever have feelings for a girl who
[2:19:04] isn't a believer
[2:19:30] because you are you are
[2:19:32] if you are alive
[2:19:34] and you are normal
[2:19:37] even if you have the holy ghost
[2:19:40] but you still have blood in your in your
[2:19:41] body
[2:19:42] moving
[2:19:43] a human being
[2:19:46] right
[2:19:47] so you will see
[2:19:49] and you will like oh yeah got it and i
[2:19:50] remember when i was in school there were
[2:19:52] nothing more submarines
[2:19:54] before and after i believed the message
[2:19:56] rather
[2:19:57] i was in a high school narrative
[2:20:00] i
[2:20:25] oh
[2:20:27] [Music]
[2:20:42] [Music]
[2:21:11] please do not do that do not mix it up
[2:21:15] attraction
[2:21:19] is a natural thing that happens
[2:21:23] but it is not at all connected to
[2:21:25] marriage
[2:21:27] let me tell you that attraction fades
[2:21:29] away with time
[2:21:35] so if you're attracted can you work
[2:21:37] sinners
[2:21:38] and then you marry her no
[2:21:53] about securitism it's only a sign of
[2:21:55] weakness
[2:21:57] as a man
[2:21:59] and a human being
[2:22:01] don't even think about marriage
[2:22:05] you can't be
[2:22:06] you can't think about marriage because
[2:22:07] you are attracted to people
[2:22:11] by the way you cannot even plan marriage
[2:22:12] because of a strong feeling
[2:22:19] of marriage
[2:22:25] that should attract you to that woman
[2:22:29] so there is no character in a woman who
[2:22:31] is not a believer
[2:22:48] like
[2:23:02] oh
[2:23:58] moment
[2:24:00] angry
[2:24:01] that's when you realize she has no
[2:24:02] character
[2:24:06] right
[2:24:07] and so is it brother says the man
[2:24:08] without the holy ghost is like a beast
[2:24:12] yeah
[2:24:54] you know the behaviors of children of
[2:24:56] god what about requires us to do this
[2:25:00] you know and when you begin to
[2:25:02] especially when you you can talk about
[2:25:03] trousers
[2:25:07] about women
[2:25:48] please please i'd like to be your friend
[2:25:52] you are gone
[2:25:54] you are gone oh
[2:25:56] wait
[2:25:58] get the brother says everything give it
[2:26:00] away
[2:26:04] you said she has
[2:26:33] when you know it
[2:26:34] because
[2:26:36] if you cannot witness to somebody well
[2:26:38] what a similar buddhism to because
[2:26:42] they are attracting you
[2:26:43] [Music]
[2:26:45] it means even the spirit you were in
[2:26:47] general
[2:26:47] your word is not the right spirit
[2:26:51] you are already overtaken
[2:26:53] and you need to come to the pastors
[2:27:00] am i preaching to someone
[2:27:02] otherwise if you love somebody
[2:27:05] and love them somewhere
[2:27:08] hallelujah
[2:27:10] you are going to really pray for them
[2:27:14] and you're going to preach to them
[2:27:17] not not have feelings for them
[2:27:21] praise the lord come here
[2:27:24] all right
[2:27:26] properly
[2:27:39] is it a must
[2:27:41] that a black should not marry a white
[2:27:43] chapter
[2:27:49] oh it was just an advice
[2:27:56] and behind here america one no he wrote
[2:27:59] something and he crossed it i mentioned
[2:28:01] about that one there's an extra time did
[2:28:02] the prophet advise us not
[2:28:05] and they changed his mind
[2:28:10] is it a mask
[2:28:12] so you already know what the prophet
[2:28:14] says
[2:28:16] what the prophet says
[2:28:20] hallelujah i mean
[2:28:23] i think i've answered that no other
[2:28:24] giant
[2:28:32] all right
[2:28:33] i i i i uh if you want my opinion i'll
[2:28:37] give you my opinion
[2:28:51] right i mean
[2:28:52] you
[2:29:05] because god doesn't like me god is not a
[2:29:06] mixer and he doesn't like mexican
[2:29:08] attack
[2:29:11] black and white and yes
[2:29:15] and then you give back to children who
[2:29:16] do not have descent
[2:29:20] and he calls them
[2:29:23] yes
[2:29:24] you know they are not white they are not
[2:29:26] black
[2:29:29] so when you you as a black man you give
[2:29:30] birth you don't give back to a white and
[2:29:32] you don't give back
[2:29:48] itself
[2:30:05] [Music]
[2:30:19] [Music]
[2:30:45] dream to my whites
[2:30:51] but that's
[2:30:53] the
[2:30:54] the spirit of our
[2:30:56] of our continent oh god
[2:31:10] all right so
[2:31:11] i think that answers that
[2:31:16] but on on those on on that
[2:31:19] uh i answered again by answering you
[2:31:22] that we have one race and that is at the
[2:31:24] christian race
[2:31:48] [Music]
[2:31:54] is
[2:32:40] [Music]
[2:33:18] oh
[2:34:00] and then you
[2:34:11] [Music]
[2:34:22] [Music]
[2:35:07] is
[2:35:11] [Music]
[2:35:38] if you love somebody but when i got home
[2:35:40] too or if you have met
[2:35:41] for the first time even if you have met
[2:35:43] for the first time
[2:35:45] you love them
[2:35:47] with the bad feelings
[2:35:51] you can feed them
[2:36:06] and then afterwards
[2:36:17] no more theopia
[2:36:20] there's a sister i don't wanna thank god
[2:36:22] i was with my wife nevertheless
[2:36:24] you know she we had preached to her she
[2:36:26] loved the message
[2:36:29] she accepted it
[2:36:31] so what went from here
[2:36:34] and she started
[2:37:17] to go there yeah it means you don't
[2:37:18] appreciate us in ethiopia
[2:37:19] ethiopia
[2:37:21] i said how come that you say that uh
[2:37:23] you connect this food with ethiopia
[2:37:25] i tell you to get such an ethiopia
[2:37:28] you should ethiopia
[2:37:30] it means
[2:37:44] you want to know what happened
[2:37:47] don't worry my wife was there
[2:37:51] and so
[2:37:52] she fed my wife my wife also named
[2:37:59] and i was there too in hungary
[2:38:02] it was really weird
[2:38:05] but after a few years
[2:38:08] i preached to the believers
[2:38:11] about culture
[2:39:08] oh
[2:39:23] the bible says that a woman should not
[2:39:25] put on anything oh i mean a cloth that
[2:39:27] is for a man does it mean
[2:39:31] that a woman cannot put on a man's
[2:39:33] jacket
[2:39:45] [Music]
[2:40:11] he's not saying husband wife or
[2:40:13] something or like me putting on my
[2:40:15] wife's car for something no no
[2:40:18] no
[2:40:58] or exchange formats of clothing
[2:41:41] [Music]
[2:42:21] [Music]
[2:42:23] if i was a woman
[2:42:37] and you know so really that is
[2:42:40] impossible for a woman to dress a
[2:42:42] trouser and she doesn't show the form
[2:42:44] out of her body
[2:42:51] of a woman
[2:42:58] it actually
[2:42:59] i'll not use the what i was going to use
[2:43:01] in the middle there but i would say it
[2:43:02] attracts naturally attracts
[2:43:05] the eyes of a man oh movie
[2:43:48] the bible
[2:43:54] [Music]
[2:44:02] the bible
[2:44:31] you'll take care of your christian even
[2:44:32] the old testament
[2:44:34] and that's why women should dress
[2:44:36] clothes that cover their bodies
[2:44:41] how long is wrong
[2:45:05] so
[2:45:06] so you see
[2:45:08] sometimes we say as long as it is below
[2:45:10] the knee to come back
[2:45:26] so i hope i've answered that if a sister
[2:45:29] wants to jog for health issues
[2:45:35] what should she wear i am
[2:45:38] not yet
[2:45:45] [Music]
[2:45:53] what should she wear
[2:45:56] just like saying if a sister is going
[2:45:58] for swimming
[2:46:01] what should she wear
[2:46:04] you are a christian when you're swimming
[2:46:06] you were a christian when you were
[2:46:07] jogging you were a christian in the
[2:46:08] everywhere you are
[2:46:12] [Music]
[2:46:17] how about if you
[2:46:19] vow to the girlfriend after believing
[2:46:21] the message what is the way forward
[2:46:25] i believe in the message what is the
[2:46:26] word for what would i answer this
[2:46:28] there was a chance
[2:46:30] i think i i answered this
[2:46:32] there are many vows that can be made
[2:46:34] one way
[2:46:49] all right let us read um this one i'm
[2:46:52] about to finish i'm just closing up i
[2:46:53] have about five papers i think i should
[2:46:55] just finish them right quickly
[2:46:59] how can one come to get a close
[2:47:01] connection with god because most of the
[2:47:03] youth try their best but in most cases
[2:47:06] things fail i personally i get
[2:47:08] challenges which i cannot be open to
[2:47:10] anyone so i'm kindly requesting for both
[2:47:13] advice and health
[2:47:19] [Music]
[2:47:25] okay
[2:47:26] now you get close to god through prayer
[2:47:29] through reading the word and
[2:47:31] um
[2:47:42] what does it take to be like you a
[2:47:45] messenger of god
[2:47:56] and you don't have to be a preacher if
[2:47:58] you're a god
[2:48:14] sing in church
[2:48:18] departments here there's a video
[2:48:19] department on my video this
[2:48:21] was you know music and everything here's
[2:48:23] the key interventions
[2:48:27] cleaning the church
[2:48:30] [Music]
[2:48:44] how does one prove that a specific
[2:48:45] pastor is a true prophet of god
[2:48:52] jesus said you would know them by their
[2:48:53] fruits yes
[2:48:56] which
[2:49:13] [Music]
[2:49:35] if worldly things are taking control of
[2:49:37] you how do you always fight
[2:49:44] [Music]
[2:50:07] and in a book courtship character and
[2:50:09] conduct the prophet says one should
[2:50:11] marry one whom she or he can't live
[2:50:15] without
[2:50:16] now question what if she or he is an
[2:50:19] unbeliever but when all his or her
[2:50:21] conduct and all characteristics show
[2:50:23] that he or she can believe
[2:50:26] can one hurry huh
[2:50:40] [Music]
[2:51:01] and all characteristics show that
[2:51:16] did
[2:52:13] [Music]
[2:52:40] oh
[2:52:44] and forever
[2:52:48] again
[2:52:51] you can make it well
[2:52:57] i understand that what marries one is
[2:53:00] the acceptance of a proposal for
[2:53:02] marriage
[2:53:05] [Music]
[2:53:09] under what circumstances does this
[2:53:11] proposal become null and void
[2:53:13] [Music]
[2:53:20] it can only become null and void in
[2:53:22] several circumstances
[2:53:26] if it's been announced by the parents
[2:53:29] that they believe
[2:53:30] is especially the father of the god
[2:53:34] if the vow was not made in good faith
[2:53:50] doesn't have a vow that you've made with
[2:53:52] anybody
[2:53:55] i want you to know
[2:53:56] when you make it
[2:53:58] all move it's not turning back
[2:54:03] so
[2:54:04] be careful with your vows
[2:54:08] don't bow if you're not ready to keep it
[2:54:12] you don't know
[2:54:14] is it adultery if a lady has something
[2:54:16] like like six children from different
[2:54:19] men whereby she's not married of to any
[2:54:21] of them
[2:54:31] of course she's an adulteress woman
[2:54:37] because banger
[2:54:40] she's lived with many men but they never
[2:54:43] said
[2:54:44] it's just like that woman who met jesus
[2:54:46] with the prostitute
[2:54:51] and she
[2:54:52] um
[2:54:53] she had she had had six five and then
[2:54:56] was living with the sixth yeah
[2:54:59] [Music]
[2:55:24] [Music]
[2:55:32] [Music]
[2:56:14] all right i have one more here oh
[2:56:16] it says the elect believers on their
[2:56:21] death
[2:56:24] food
[2:56:25] go to the 16th dimension
[2:56:28] and the non-believers
[2:56:31] are
[2:56:32] uh goes to the fifth dimension
[2:56:36] on the second resurrection
[2:56:50] [Music]
[2:56:52] no
[2:56:54] the ones who are separated like sheep
[2:56:56] from god
[2:57:00] who gets salvation opportunity
[2:57:02] thereafter judgment
[2:57:05] before this
[2:57:06] when their faith is not yet decided
[2:57:09] which dimension are they the sixth
[2:57:12] or the fifth
[2:57:14] i mean
[2:57:16] so the brother is asking
[2:57:21] i don't know if all of you know what i
[2:57:22] mentioned
[2:57:25] fourth dimension in science
[2:57:28] science fifth dimension
[2:57:31] um it speaks of um
[2:57:34] uh the the souls that are
[2:57:39] uh are sleeping this one is saying that
[2:57:41] they mentioned and the non-believers
[2:57:44] well the fifth dimension which is hell
[2:57:51] okay so he says that the unbelievers
[2:57:53] they go to the fifth dimension
[2:57:57] and the believers go to the sixth
[2:57:59] dimension
[2:58:02] so
[2:58:02] cathy the goddess and the seventh
[2:58:05] dimension
[2:58:07] and so the question is
[2:58:09] there are people who are abandoned that
[2:58:11] when
[2:58:14] they on the on the white throne judgment
[2:58:29] the millennium
[2:58:57] that life the eternal life that there's
[2:58:59] nobody going together in life on the
[2:59:01] white front judge
[2:59:07] whoever will be given it
[2:59:10] already possessed
[2:59:11] [Music]
[2:59:24] but those souls that will receive grace
[2:59:28] whatever the name is the finish sir when
[2:59:30] the white front judgment
[2:59:32] in general is because they had already
[2:59:34] received it
[2:59:38] this way
[2:59:39] right now now now catch
[2:59:48] but they may not come in the rapture
[2:59:52] that's true is that true it's the truth
[2:59:54] so they
[3:00:03] [Music]
[3:00:04] because all those who believe in christ
[3:00:06] got one place
[3:00:08] i'm christopher
[3:00:51] i do not exactly know if they were with
[3:00:53] with the others with the the others who
[3:00:56] were under 60 dimension
[3:00:59] i don't exactly know if they were with
[3:01:01] the
[3:01:02] others who were waiting to get
[3:01:05] resurrection
[3:01:10] this is one that i want to uh look at
[3:01:13] more carefully
[3:01:16] who shall be these kings
[3:01:18] of the earth bringing
[3:01:20] uh
[3:01:22] glory into this okay i don't understand
[3:01:25] this into this city okay can you read
[3:01:27] for me revelation twenty one twenty
[3:01:31] uh could be cool
[3:02:00] can you read that in english for me
[3:02:06] i think he's talking about the city
[3:02:08] when i okay
[3:02:15] then you have an underneath okay verses
[3:02:18] um 21 verses 24
[3:02:23] and the nations of them which are saved
[3:02:25] shall walk in the light of it
[3:02:28] and the kings of the earth
[3:02:32] do bring their glory
[3:02:35] and horner into it
[3:02:37] and the gates of it shall not be shut at
[3:02:39] all by day for there shall be no night
[3:02:42] there
[3:02:43] now i believe
[3:02:44] that the bible says we the bride
[3:02:47] are the kings and the priests
[3:02:54] by the way do you know that you were
[3:02:55] king and priest over deutsche main jury
[3:02:56] cover
[3:03:02] the moment you believe christ and
[3:03:03] receive the holy ghost is that christian
[3:03:05] of name you you come into arroyo
[3:03:09] into royals oh yeah
[3:03:21] [Music]
[3:03:23] and we will also have glory because it
[3:03:25] says
[3:03:27] which part is that
[3:03:28] and they shall walk okay they shall walk
[3:03:30] in the light okay of course we always
[3:03:31] sing the song we will walk in the light
[3:03:32] the beautiful light okay then it says
[3:03:35] uh which verse is that again please
[3:03:37] 20
[3:03:40] and the nations of them which are saved
[3:03:42] shall walk in the light of it and the
[3:03:44] kings of the earth shall bring their
[3:03:46] glory into it
[3:03:50] yes
[3:04:01] god almighty and the lamb are the temple
[3:04:04] of it
[3:04:05] and i believe that all those people
[3:04:06] because there are those that are saved
[3:04:08] but not kings not in royalty not not not
[3:04:11] the bride
[3:04:17] so i for now believe that these kings
[3:04:19] will be the bride when you get it
[3:04:26] we will bring our glory into the city
[3:04:33] okay there's another one here but all
[3:04:34] these questions that brother you've
[3:04:36] asked i need to go through them again
[3:04:38] when i'm not tired
[3:04:48] they're deep and they need deeper
[3:04:49] studies
[3:04:52] because at this youthful age it's when
[3:04:55] boys and girls are attracted to each
[3:04:57] other
[3:04:58] and they
[3:04:59] and they jump
[3:05:01] pitch it can come back
[3:05:03] in the future when one is old
[3:05:06] for the notion of the first
[3:05:08] time for everything okay
[3:05:16] now
[3:05:18] [Music]
[3:05:44] you don't indulge in what the world does
[3:05:46] say when you are moving
[3:05:48] and you live as a different man
[3:05:52] praise the name of the lord
[3:05:54] so we are done with all the questions
[3:05:56] we've gone through with most of them i
[3:05:58] see i have i am not the one who asked
[3:06:01] that question i would
[3:06:03] like you pastor to talk about
[3:06:05] forgiveness be bilically
[3:06:12] i irrespective
[3:06:14] of what it is
[3:06:17] oh okay you're saying you're not the one
[3:06:18] who asked the question about forgiveness
[3:06:20] but you want to admit about forgiveness
[3:06:41] clarify your discussion
[3:07:02] that's why i said i'll go in detail in
[3:07:04] need but
[3:07:06] i just say that believers forgive
[3:07:12] i don't think you can explain
[3:07:13] forgiveness i don't know
[3:07:15] some people have hearts that they can't
[3:07:17] forgive somebody even when someone asked
[3:07:20] for forgiveness
[3:07:26] but the scripture teaches us if you're
[3:07:29] only going to say if someone has done
[3:07:31] something against your mother nature
[3:07:33] because they listen
[3:07:35] go to them gain the charity
[3:07:39] don't wait for them to come to you
[3:07:42] yes maybe they don't know that they did
[3:07:44] that
[3:07:46] you go to them
[3:07:48] tell them you have been offended
[3:08:11] [Music]
[3:08:32] they do is contrary you'll never become
[3:08:35] done without them
[3:08:37] you are alone
[3:08:41] what do you do
[3:08:43] praise the lord come here i said praise
