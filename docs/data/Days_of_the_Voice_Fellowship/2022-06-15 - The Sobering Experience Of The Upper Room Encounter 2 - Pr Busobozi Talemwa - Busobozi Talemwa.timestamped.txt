[9:23] [Music]
[9:30] [Music]
[9:39] [Music]
[9:46] [Music]
[9:53] [Music]
[10:13] and we are reading
[10:15] once again from
[10:34] is
[10:52] and jesus
[10:53] walking by the sea of galilee
[10:56] saw true brethren simon called peter and
[11:00] andrew his brother
[11:02] casting a net into the sea for they were
[11:04] fishers
[11:06] and is
[11:07] he saith unto them
[11:09] follow me and i will make you fishers of
[11:11] men
[11:12] and they straight away left their nets
[11:14] and followed him
[11:26] and
[11:38] and going on from thence he saw other
[11:41] two brethren james the son of zebedee
[11:44] and john his brother in a ship with
[11:46] zebedee their father mending their nets
[11:48] and he called them and they immediately
[11:50] left the ship and their father and
[11:52] followed him mangua ago nevada
[12:34] i'm speaking on the sobering experience
[12:36] of the upper room
[12:50] and this is going to be a part 2.
[12:54] and we talked about a little bit of it
[12:56] on
[12:57] sunday
[13:00] and it's good to see those who have uh
[13:02] were here tonight
[13:17] amen that's what joy is
[13:36] and
[13:36] i thought that this is a good subject to
[13:38] speak about after we had spent a few
[13:41] weeks talking about the calling
[13:46] forever
[14:08] [Music]
[14:20] [Music]
[14:25] is one thing but to stay and to abide in
[14:28] your coding is another
[15:01] [Music]
[15:12] [Music]
[16:05] yes
[16:07] [Music]
[16:14] [Applause]
[16:17] [Music]
[16:27] [Applause]
[16:49] others
[16:54] the bible says that
[16:56] this so and so found grace in the sight
[16:58] of god
[17:03] [Music]
[18:26] for so long we can be in the church for
[18:28] so long
[18:30] but you see that does not mean that you
[18:32] have become super naive
[18:36] and this by the way is their greatest
[18:38] hindrance to christianity
[20:14] [Music]
[20:30] and then you also come driving with your
[20:32] alcohol smelling all over your mouth
[20:39] with you everyone and now they simply
[20:41] put a tester
[20:44] and they tell you breathe
[20:47] and then
[20:50] if you
[20:51] have alcohol in your system
[20:56] the machine catches
[21:18] [Music]
[21:41] they may be speaking in tongues
[21:44] they may be shouting in the holy grail
[21:46] but as long as they cannot pass the word
[21:49] test
[21:56] now these three these men the disciples
[22:00] of jesus christ
[22:03] they they sat under the ministry of
[22:05] jesus christ
[22:08] of three years and a half
[22:25] but at the end of it all he can be a
[22:27] greater they forgot
[22:30] the purpose for why they were called
[22:38] jesus called them from being fishers of
[22:40] men
[22:41] to being from being fishers of fish to
[22:43] being fishers of men
[22:49] and like i told you on sunday jesus
[22:51] question was not to disappoint
[23:03] [Applause]
[23:20] jesus is not that
[23:34] you wanted to be
[24:46] amen you are not cheap holy allies
[24:50] hallelujah amina
[24:52] i am not cheap this is the city where i
[24:54] see you are not cheap
[24:56] every seed of god is not cheap
[24:58] yeah
[25:35] [Applause]
[25:40] come and follow
[26:06] i'm going to make it brighter
[27:06] nature
[27:07] praise the name of the lord
[27:10] there is no loss
[27:12] [Music]
[27:14] i said there is no loss
[27:15] [Music]
[27:16] there's someone here who believes that
[27:18] in a while
[27:31] wearing those big robes
[27:44] i thought it was the best thing to do to
[27:46] be closer to god
[28:00] he told
[28:14] amina
[28:17] praise the name of the lord come here
[28:20] hallelujah amina
[28:24] the
[28:24] then the bible tells us here when the
[28:26] bible
[28:29] that these is
[28:30] have said i know
[28:34] one day of course after the death of
[28:36] jesus
[28:39] they were no longer with him
[28:42] and one day peter was there repeatedly
[28:45] and he felt like going to fish
[28:48] he felt like going back in his old life
[28:54] in church
[28:55] that's the worst decision you will ever
[29:09] not to live your
[29:35] you are going to be worse than you were
[29:37] when you were there in the first place
[29:53] and jesus came and asked them yes
[29:56] give me a little feedback
[29:59] they said no i got my name we didn't
[30:01] catch nothing
[30:05] we went through that on sunday
[30:07] told them to cast on the right side
[30:12] that they shall find
[30:16] but i want to skip all that because we
[30:18] talked about on when is on sunday
[30:25] [Music]
[30:49] basement the mushy taker once which is
[30:50] him and the only fire you have got left
[30:52] is in the basement
[30:56] you see what we need
[30:57] what we need is an old upper room
[30:59] experience
[31:12] this is exactly what this disciples
[31:13] needed
[31:56] [Applause]
[32:12] this man had
[32:38] jesus is the best teacher that the world
[32:39] has ever seen i don't know
[32:54] jesus went in again
[32:57] and they remained alone
[33:00] some of them have even sweared
[33:03] we will never leave you
[33:06] where are you going we will go
[33:08] nothing
[33:22] some of them
[33:36] and on that day when he was going to be
[33:38] taken away by the
[33:40] scribes and the pharisees
[33:45] told them to bring whatever they had
[33:47] again
[33:48] everybody
[33:50] knowing their hearts
[34:06] listen to this brother don't say it i
[34:08] wanted to preach it they had simply
[34:10] received the encounter with the man
[34:13] by the performances
[34:16] they had received an encounter with the
[34:18] man jesus
[34:21] with the ministry of jesus
[34:24] the word
[34:26] they had not yet received an encounter
[34:28] with the life that was in jesus name
[34:45] i can actually even show
[35:17] you know sometimes there are those that
[35:18] want to show that there are more
[35:19] believers than others
[35:25] and peter was one of them
[35:28] and when the man cut off his ears
[35:33] jesus looked at peter yesterday take a
[35:35] look at jesus
[35:39] jesus pick the ear yes
[35:42] and he put it back
[36:00] is not to be taken lightly
[36:04] it's a spiritual thing being to be among
[36:06] you it's to be taken spiritually
[36:09] you
[36:12] the only way we are going to
[36:14] abide in our calling is to receive the
[36:16] holy spirit
[36:21] of the upper room encounters
[37:06] if god requires sincerity
[37:13] and then if god requires a sacrifice
[37:20] to god what do you want
[37:21] [Music]
[39:26] beautiful
[39:39] the beauty of holiness is where god
[39:41] dwells in cattle
[39:44] we are the power of the holy spirit
[39:46] [Music]
[39:48] hallelujah
[39:50] praise the name of allah coming
[39:52] and by the way that is from honestly
[39:53] contending for the faith
[40:31] [Music]
[40:36] people don't walk and people don't walk
[40:40] anyhow as crippled as the church is
[40:42] around
[40:46] he says your faith is your crush
[41:01] there will never be an organization ever
[41:04] substitute the upper room experience
[41:07] [Music]
[41:11] friends i'm sorry
[41:13] you may come and attend the church
[41:16] they give you offerings
[41:18] you
[41:45] but the moment he came back to his
[41:47] senses
[41:49] he said he noticed he had gone there
[41:51] together that at that moment he would
[41:53] have lost his life
[41:56] and then what matters
[43:09] there will never be a school will never
[43:11] will ever take place at pentecost
[43:16] not by power not by might but my by my
[43:19] spiritual ethos
[43:23] that's what we need today
[43:35] [Music]
[43:39] twice born
[43:43] i say amen lord give it to me
[43:46] this is what the world needs today
[43:50] is a revival an all-time revival
[43:57] imagine the disciples were always here
[43:59] and today
[44:02] they never found sure purpose before the
[44:04] upper room encountered
[44:20] [Music]
[44:48] an upper room encounter whatever it is
[44:52] you are even worse than the unbelievers
[44:56] [Music]
[44:59] help me understand what i'm talking
[45:00] about
[45:15] and he says
[45:18] literally like in our language you would
[45:20] say
[45:21] word go when the word remember we can
[45:23] say i will die for you
[45:26] peter said that prayer
[45:29] did he mean it directed
[45:44] this
[45:57] do you love me
[46:39] i will not leave you
[46:53] is
[47:00] [Applause]
[47:44] [Music]
[49:42] faithfully
[50:25] fire by denying him away god
[50:28] why what he had not yet received that
[50:30] encounter
[50:34] hallelujah
[50:40] that's a man before they receive the
[50:41] holocaust
[50:45] i wanted to paint a picture for you
[50:50] that a man before they received the
[50:52] holocaust
[50:55] they can do anything
[50:59] can do anything
[51:03] and what we need
[51:05] is the holy ghost
[51:17] you need to receive an encounter with
[51:20] our goal for insisting
[52:06] and a little old sellers of purple women
[52:13] and those gathered themselves in an
[52:14] upper room
[53:40] do you think i really want to come well
[53:43] i want to preach to you and shout and
[53:45] move
[53:46] on
[53:48] to your name then get back and
[53:50] be very wary
[53:54] it's out of duty
[53:57] if i don't do it i i am bound to do it
[54:05] and there are many many hundreds of
[54:06] millions like me in the world
[54:22] [Applause]
[55:17] but these were sent to men in a reality
[55:20] to me to everyone to why watch it
[55:23] because it is the only man
[55:26] that can receive an emperor encounters
[55:30] our guru it's only men
[56:00] they will be headed for the tribulation
[56:04] the tribulation is as real as we are
[56:06] here right now
[56:10] i was just hearing news today i think
[56:12] they don't know
[56:14] and
[56:22] nobody will make taiwan
[56:25] uh
[56:26] uh away from them or like
[56:28] is it
[56:38] [Music]
[56:42] bath pain
[56:46] and you see the walls and rumors of
[56:48] walls everywhere
[56:51] and uh you know very well that this
[56:53] actually will be leading towards what
[56:56] the bible promise would be moment
[57:00] of bible
[57:03] diseases in what day
[57:06] many of these are caused even by men
[57:09] but
[57:37] somewhere in the upper room somewhere
[57:43] amen and then fill them with the holy
[57:45] ghost all right
[57:47] and then send them back again in the
[57:49] world ah the sin became a demon you go
[57:51] and be fishers of men
[58:07] how about you too
[58:09] i said no god bless you no i'm coming
[58:12] amen
[58:13] no i've decided no one
[58:16] from what the lord has done for me
[58:19] that i'm going to be a part of this
[58:22] question
[58:26] no no you are true man of god
[58:29] you are a true prophet
[58:32] your message is correct
[58:34] it is from
[59:03] name is food
[59:04] so come here
[59:06] and from today
[59:08] this will be my home channel
[59:12] [Applause]
[59:15] another brother
[59:28] [Music]
[59:39] but in this case i want us to look at
[59:40] noah and his ark as he is where he heard
[59:43] the message of the hour
[59:57] when the world was so civilized
[1:00:04] the world until today has not yet
[1:00:06] reached the civilization
[1:00:14] [Applause]
[1:00:27] pyramid of giza pyramid
[1:00:29] in egypt
[1:00:31] mystery you know we can talk about that
[1:00:32] pyramid one day
[1:00:34] actually according to history
[1:00:37] no one knows who built that pyramid
[1:00:40] ariana
[1:00:46] and these pyramids are all built almost
[1:00:48] in the same fashion
[1:00:51] but these other pyramids will be able to
[1:00:54] put the pharaohs that are that were dead
[1:00:56] and uh you know they had they made they
[1:00:58] made the mummies and they put them in
[1:01:00] there
[1:01:05] but you see this great pyramid that is
[1:01:22] kinds
[1:01:24] it stands in the true north of the world
[1:01:30] when you see all the characteristics
[1:01:32] that make up that pyramid
[1:01:34] is so heavy to your neighbor pyramiding
[1:01:36] you will find that it so much directs
[1:01:40] people to nature
[1:01:46] with so much shows and points to uh to
[1:01:49] to to what already god blessed in the
[1:01:52] skies
[1:01:55] and no one knows who built that pyramid
[1:02:00] all these archaeologists and science and
[1:02:02] uh historians they don't know
[1:02:04] how
[1:02:17] [Music]
[1:02:29] there's a lot to talk about that pyramid
[1:02:31] one day i'll take time and you know when
[1:02:33] is the service and talk about it
[1:02:37] but here we receive a prophet in this
[1:02:39] end time
[1:02:42] who gave us an answer that the world
[1:02:44] does not know
[1:02:46] where
[1:03:00] that even the great scientists and
[1:03:02] historians don't have
[1:03:03] a crisis
[1:03:14] i was the one that he uses well then he
[1:03:16] says he build that pyramid
[1:03:20] that pyramid was built it had to be a
[1:03:23] prospect
[1:03:27] [Music]
[1:03:49] [Music]
[1:04:38] they came
[1:05:06] civilization
[1:05:10] with all the civilizations we have to
[1:05:13] turn the technology they cannot even
[1:05:15] rebuild the pyramid of visa organization
[1:05:24] which means the technology and the
[1:05:25] science and the civilization that was
[1:05:28] there in the days of law
[1:05:30] by now the one we have that was greater
[1:05:34] than ours
[1:07:12] this one ain't no not even god himself
[1:07:15] can sink naked
[1:07:19] and on its first foreign
[1:07:40] was having a different message
[1:07:43] just like the message we have today
[1:07:46] is so different
[1:07:49] and it makes sometimes the believers
[1:07:51] feel as if oh
[1:07:52] how will the world look at us
[1:08:08] doing makeup is beautiful
[1:08:16] making up yourself to beautify yourself
[1:08:21] and we know that the life of the devil i
[1:08:23] think that to my neighbor was turned
[1:08:25] it is not beautifying yourself secretly
[1:08:29] if you do makeup
[1:08:31] attack on the way
[1:08:33] actually it's not a new thing
[1:08:35] do you know that makeup has not come
[1:08:37] because of technology
[1:08:39] technology yes yes
[1:08:41] makeup was here even before technology
[1:08:43] make up
[1:08:44] technology
[1:08:48] all the heathens

[1:09:11] you know in ireland maryland before they
[1:09:14] all received christ
[1:09:17] they were painting themselves
[1:09:22] they were in karamoja recently american
[1:09:25] cow trolley calamari you can even see
[1:09:26] the believers who were who believed uh
[1:09:29] brotherhood believed after having thrown
[1:09:31] to a certain degree
[1:09:47] with the purana ethiopia
[1:09:50] and and even
[1:09:51] as you go into those remote remote areas
[1:09:59] you find they will paint themselves like
[1:10:01] cops
[1:10:05] they will pierce themselves
[1:10:09] pieces of their bodies
[1:10:12] they will put things on their ears to
[1:11:02] and i don't care whether you call
[1:11:04] yourself a christian or a child of god
[1:11:06] see foreign
[1:11:24] there
[1:11:29] [Music]
[1:11:52] do
[1:13:13] with all the demons and spirits over
[1:13:15] here
[1:13:28] the devil has made himself the angel of
[1:13:30] life satan here
[1:13:32] foreign spirits and demons have come
[1:13:35] even in chuckles
[1:13:41] and these days even men
[1:13:44] are
[1:13:56] as it were as if they were full of
[1:13:59] demons
[1:14:02] saying they are giving praise to the
[1:14:04] lord
[1:14:05] over 10 years
[1:14:07] putting their lips up never when you
[1:14:09] kill me full of blood
[1:14:13] and i'm sure you know that part of the
[1:14:14] ingredients that make those makeup is
[1:14:17] some parts of human beings
[1:14:25] cannibals
[1:15:07] [Music]
[1:15:33] you see the shock the seat somehow needs
[1:15:35] the shock sometimes uh
[1:16:03] on that day
[1:16:15] [Applause]
[1:16:31] that's why let me tell you even if you
[1:16:33] are only one in a nation standing for
[1:16:35] the truth standing for the word of god
