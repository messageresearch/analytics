I hope he's in you this morning Lord Jesus we do not hope in what we have or what we can attainment yes we do not open our plans Lord Jesus in our thoughts in our ways and father Lord we ask that we shall find you this morning as you speak to us and even myself and my brother Lord we take ourselves out of the ways nothing good that we can say but if you would just come and anoint us that you have chosen and you have loved foreign [Music] [Music] a CE God bless you sir I'd like to greet each of you in the name of Jesus Christ it's a blessing to have you and to be in the presence of God together all the vistas for the first time I want to say you're welcome but now you are you are almost one of us and if you want to know why I said almost amen but the the word there is one of us my brother here God bless you Charles I'm happy to see you God bless you and now may we open our Bibles of faith we are going to in the book of Hebrews chapter 10. we are reading out of that verse 35 is foreign this is like a continuation of what we have been talking about but our title is different yeah because I've been speaking on the power of Revelation today our title is different under the same Inspirations this morning and she said they had taken a trip and they were not able to make it but I think it will be streaming the service so um because not away there are for your confidence which which has great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of God he might receive the promise for yet a little while and and he that shall come will come and will not Tarry now they just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall not have my my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto Perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul is [Music] [Music] praise the Lord I'm requesting that you as usual you give me your undivided attention and avoid moving out as much as you can if you really must go out this is that moment and then you come back and we hear This Together from foreign foreign [Music] foreign you see that's why without faith the Bible says it is impossible to please because if you have no faith you cannot know the will of God for your life when you don't know for sure what God requires for you and so faith is an ingredient which every Christian should have gone in order to please God down even to what we dress you know how we work even the little things you can do something little and then displeases God then faith is is the knowledge of what God wants you to do it may not even sometimes be written in the Holy Bible questions you see but because you were a child of God with the Holy Spirit you know you will you will you receive faith and then you will know what exactly God wants you to do in so this is the reason why Christians go to attend fellowships the reason we attend Fellowship every time is because we want to receive faith we want to have faith for our strength tough strength to know exactly what to do all the situations you know sometimes when you are down and you you you know you're down cast foreign foreign [Applause] for ye of need of patience after you have done the will of God you now might receive the promise there are many promises in the Bible and here I'm here this morning speaking to you how to attain your promises this is how you attain your promises after you have done the will of God Revelations Jesus will not tell you yes by the way lest we forget Jesus is coming back again soon I wish you can tell your neighbor that is Jesus is coming back at you yes now the just shall live by faith he says they're just they Justified what is justification justification is when you have sinned the Bible says you are just foreign [Music] praise the name of the Lord follow me here now verses shall live by faitha praise the name of the Lord they just shall live by faith but if any man draw backwards everybody read with me my soul shall have no place if you've been Justified but then he says if any man myself amen say friends I was reading in the Book of Genesis you know I read the Bible before but I want to read it all through again and I'd like to challenge you to do the same name and see I saw something that I had never seen before whenever you go to read through the Bible you see something new because we here in this church now that Cain was serpent seeds who was later replaced with Sith was the seed of God says foreign oh yeah yeah and then when you know when he's down you find all the sons after them they had hell on them body code on their names that means L really is a word for God is you see that that that implies God there right there that means the house of God is great that is if you find out later on there was a someone born praise the name of the Lord let me see if I can pick it right quick for you here I'm going to get my points was born uh um he took uh and of course this was the first civilization by the way this first civilization was made under a king that's according to the Bible is the first civilization Revelation I mean Genesis 4 you will know what I'm talking about the Bible says took two wives and then that's the first time it is recorded that somebody took two wives and then of course as you go down you know this father and father away they went from so they drew back but if you notice now speaks of uh safe who comes who came on much later and now the generations of God or the seed of God began to call upon the name of the Lord foreign [Music] we are not of them that draw back they suffering foreign [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] I will not mention the name I called one of my friends and I asked him preach to me for a minute I told him I'm going to speak on this subject this morning but I need someone to preach to me I said preach to me yeah immediately the Holy Spirit came upon him for a minute and then he shared the scripture I was really encouraged to preach what I'm preaching to you and one of the things he shared with me and he read only one scripture out of just his memory and he said Jesus said unto him again all things are possible that is [Applause] some kind of army and they would go out to fight their enemies and you know then this little boy was trained War drums and you see like here we know in Uganda and other cultures we have different types of drum sounds you know when they're calling people to come maybe for a meeting they will beat a certain type of dance as their men went foreign I want you now to foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] sometimes the Devil Comes almost going nowhere he tells you you're going nowhere there is no hope for you it is just a feeling now you can have another idea and listen the Bible says he said I'm not pleased who is feeling like me this morning makes you so poor now you feel you have no hope maybe comes not gentle to even the church even the church is falling what do you see he will speak to you the devil speaks through the mind and I'm not following my mind I'm following my heart because God is right in there and I'm determined not to give up one time I spoke to my wife and I told her I said something that she has never heard I said do I have to be a pastor do I have to be a preacher can't I have do this and listen this is successful and do other things foreign but you have to go to church each time do you have to sing do you do you have to to preach brother martin again the devil's never told you that do you have to preach anymore do you have to go on the streets to you the devil has never told you do you have to be a Christian what is good about it you are just straining yourself but those are the voices and I've come to you this morning with the voice of God [Music] [Applause] always around my friends foreign and the devil will tell us to surrender to retreat today America and we are not going to accept it in this journey you know I want to show you something even the devil spoke to Jesus you are now discouraged that the devil spoke to me that way what about if I told you spoke to Jesus I hope you still love Jesus looked on the 239 and he came out and went And he as he was want to the Mount of Olives and his disciples also followed him this was the moment when Jesus was about to die and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that he entered not into temptation and he was withdrawn from them about aston's cast and kneel down and prayed if you foreign and I'm telling you what I've experienced same you you when you were a pastor to the people you were Superman to the people you never have Trials of your own for the people you are this give of solutions to the people you never have any heart attack but do you know how much pain we go through to eat them when you preach to somebody don't know what you preach to people and they don't change or when you preach to somebody and they walk away from the truth as a matter of fact Maxima somebody shared with me a verse of what Jesus told the disciples he said if you you preach and they don't accept if they reject you shake off the doubt of you could be worse do you think it is easy for a preacher to cuss somebody foreign until some have decided to go and do some magic so that we can show the people it works even if I prayed I don't know how many people they died and so what do we do we have nobody to talk to encourage us so what do we do we encourage ourselves in the Lord and look at what God has done look at the success he can do more he said this is difficult and he went to God in prayers foreign [Music] [Music] Christian Lord not my way Jesus if he was to use his own wheels the Son of God he was not going to die for you he himself hated the cross he didn't like it he didn't answer it came from Glory um [Music] it was a very difficult time it was very painful it was a bad time it wasn't easy but Lord let's not consider my way even you now in your life you're also giving a cup away I will not give up I will not Retreat surrender foreign if it took an angel to come from him Guru to strengthen the Lord you need to be strengthened my mind I am goddess your preachers the messages don't go away because you have trouble hear the encouragement and the strings when you get strengthened then you will carry on of course that's what I I have to make one hour so now listen in this journey but When You Reach verses he says and they appeared an angel unto him from Heaven strengthening him and being an Agony he prayed more honestly and the situation where great drops of blood falling from down to the ground yes and he realized that he was going to die together being God he knew what was coming and he was in agony says [Applause] I don't know what else but he says he prayed in our goodness he prayed to the extent the tears were Tears like blood yes he got thoughts foreign the devil tried to tempt him convincing him please surrender if he had made those stones bread you would have surrendered the only one is it would mean surrender don't do what the devil wants you to do it may not even be wrong but if the devil wants you to do it don't do it don't do it do what God tells you to do the devil tried to convince Jesus to surrender by giving him Victory without fighting by giving him the kingdom without the cross the devil attack Jesus the last of the flesh turn these stones into bread that's the last of the flesh you are dying oh you need to eat hey imagine imagine the joy you will have there is and remember you are promised there will be no stone to to cut your feet one Russian friend of mine brother wanted to take me to skydive from the place but I told him uh later next time but you see it's but I came to Germany foreign you know it's enjoyable Oh you mean one that's how the world is the devil offers you things on a platter silver platter you did work for it you didn't suffer for it just get it for free yeah that's what the Devil comes to each of you today every day we eat and just sit Anybody Everybody the pride of life and some people that's why they go to bed what I have so I can get a lot without suffering and fighting foreign [Music] that is the no one in the Bible got anything good without laboring foreign to give me money for my children images [Music] [Music] get the whole foreign it is [Music] I'm going to suffer for it I'm ready the devil wants you to do to surrender by getting the pride of life the last of the eyes that's another thing you tempted Jesus and accumulation of wealth without God he will take you to Hell whatever you see foreign foreign you are smart when no new year and my brother you know Herbert I was always you know dressed in those times and I dress properly and with white yeah I'm going to church with my Bible the Bible in the morning and then you of course when it's coming so you talk in general is really great or whatever color according to the soil [Music] [Music] foreign and collect her foreign see praise the name of the Lord the last of the eyes see you come down don't be like this so-called Pentecostals who tell their people if I find your mind foreign without him working foreign what if the president would say I come to take you and and I have authority to do so and make you the president of the United States you have to give it up you have to give it up you will become it but you have to give it up sometimes sometimes you will give it up that's what it is you you would have to give it up but Jesus gives you a crown of life that we will never give up an Incorruptible crown of his glory we don't have to give it up we don't have to give it he gives it to us it is a blessing it's the holy spirit that he wants to Crown our life hallelujah amen and I have 10 minutes left and I want in this 10 minutes to talk to you about Arnold Arnold the man of heat Switzerland um we spoke on this I'll just talk to you about it by reading this quote I hope it is a blessing to you praise the name of the Lord amen here no longer go in Switzerland standing up here in a big high out Mountain I was thinking about Arnold Von winkry difficult many of you know that the story hero he was many years ago in Switzerland and how that the Swiss nation was being invaded by a mighty Army and the cities were being taken Blood Of The Swiss people congregated from the mountains into the valley with such little weapons as they could defend themselves and he says and when they stood there on the field and they landed approaching them when they were approaching this great army they were outnumbered 51. and they wasn't soldiers so they weren't trained they didn't know what to do but this Army that was invading was well trained every man like a brick wall coming right and when they were standing there with their Spears moving up one great man stepped out and his name and as he stepped out there in the presence they were hopeless everything they could think of was lost they would simply have to go down their homes be lost your situation stepped out and said yeah I'll give my life for Switzerland and the homelands he said what will you do he said down in the he's a lovely little home where my wife and the little children are waiting for me to come back but they will never see me again for this day I shall give my life he didn't go to fight so that he can leave he went to fight so that he can die for a right course hey again said if you decided to take me to hell yes if going there because and so this man was ready to die or impressing upon you is you should be ready to die bad for a right course dying is not a thing because you died and so he was ready to die for his country and as he said that they said what will you do and he said now every one of you that's got weapons and do the best you can fight with what you've gone one is foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] the sons of Adam [Music] redeem the foreign fell out of the heavens above and armored every man with a weapon hallelujah hallelujah I saw you have a report we are weaponizing children of God we are not here to surrender we are not here to give up we are here with weapons let me finish up the court Hallelujah man and I say today my brethren every man too I said every man to anyone every man if you are here you might as well respond I said to you my brothers [Applause] let's do the best with God let us fight to the last month we got the enemies line bro anger Christ defeated Saturn Christian dripped him of everything is nothing today but a bluff when he tells you we can't have another old-fashioned holy ghosts we have it today because the lines of the enemy is [Music] our time to run behind our heroes foreign [Music] who you don't know okay to you he was a year I didn't know okay give me more give me more Malcolm X so Malcolm X is your hero okay I've lived in the world and quite frankly I don't refuse they have been men in many ranks of Life unto whom it is it's just like political parties and that's okay no problem he doesn't take me or you to Hell listen to me those heroes are wildly Heroes feet and they are heroism are you hearing me it ends here that's not the kind of superhero I want this is just like voting it's just like voting you can vote forever and listen Church yeah it is not a sin banana CTV voting is all right and you can vote for whoever stand for the values the reason we have a lot of things that are not going well in our society is because of the mind of the people not the minds of the people they vote if they see someone because he has dreadlocks it shows what kind of law mind they have once and this person goes in power and they delivers nothing we begin to blame up people that's why pastors
