especially for our online people they are getting issues with the [Music] sound but we will trying to toy that praise the Lord how many Happ to be the house of your neighbor and tell them you're welcome to the house of the Lord God bless you amen so uh we how many have had a chance to to watch that testimony ofor ones who have not I don't know which world you are living in there are many actually more than a thousand people who have watched that already heard from hundreds of [Music] them Tony so we had some kind of uh some kind of uh Studio here and they were we were having an interview morus and his wife and with my wife as well and those who have heard especially the young people have said is a blessing have you had a chance to no okay you see so all young people who are here if you have not had a chance to listen you either busy or not serious so go and listen to it if you're not married because mainly it was uh their marriage testimony and so I trust it will be a blessing it will help you to know at least on the approach of marriage also heard from a few ministers pastors just appreciated it they say as it is a blessing it's going to be a blessing to their amen and so uh this is our first Wednesday service after the meetings second our first it is brother prince who preached and we are really blessed and uh so I said I don't want to rest so I have to minister this evening I've been trying to dodge Minister because of being tired in the body and even after the meetings we've been having you know Pastor morus left yesterday so I still think I will still need to go for rest for a while but I could not go before the wedding of brother Andrew tomorrow many of you or some are going to go to where there will be the the I think we call it introduction but I think it is the traditional [Music] ceremony and then on Saturday we shall have the wedding here the wedding ceremony here and then I think they will have the reception some other place so great times ahead I hope you've been praying I know there's a prayer chain Brother Martin has formed me of that so whoever is part of that prayer chain you are the life of this church and God bless you so much so remember to pray for Brother Martin brother brother Andrew's wedding that it will be successful amen praise the Lord sister winred God bless you I don't know why you sitting behind you should or you have a child by God's grace by God's grace have also been requested to speak to evening light bright Tabernacle so while we are here at dvf also we ministering to the Saints at evening light they'll be streaming this on their Zoom service tonight so weend all ours just going to read one verse and out of 1 Corinthians chapter 11 the first verse shall we pray Our Kind heavenly father as I'm approaching your holy word my request Lord is that you will come and make it alive to us we can do nothing of ourselves we have no abilities of our own we submit whatever little we have to you tonight I ask that you will come and bless everyone that is here everyone that is here in this may it be a blessing to them in Jesus name amen so whenever I'm doing Zoom I also usually we just usually go strictly for 1 hour so by 656 we'll be finishing the so uh let's read in Jesus name be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ amen may be seated so I'm preaching on pointing people to Christ pointing people to Christ now we have a lot of churches we have a lot of people preaching we have a lot of Pastors in the world we have a lot of denominations and religions and a lot of systems as well and the biggest of which is actually the Roman Catholic Church um and you see everyone that comes up can almost get a following you know they will you know get a following it's not it's not hard to get a following and these days people love getting a following not only physically but also on social media people are happy to get a following on Tik Tok if you have following on WhatsApp you have a following and you are very excited because of those things on on LinkedIn on Twitter and someone will say I have 10,000 followers and he will be very excited and you will feel that is something but you see it's nothing to have a following because I will tell you one one there is one person in the world has the biggest following and that is Saturn not even Jesus Satan sat has the biggest following so having a following is not a big deal you know the Bible says the way that leads to hell and many there be that but the WEA leads to Heaven is narrow is straight and few there that but you know many people always they desire to have a big following or they desire to follow where there are many people following I remember one time an airport in Nairobi and we were we were driving you know through a to in order for us to enter the airport and so the brother that was was driving you know there were about three or four lenses so he decided to take the Lan that was crowded I told him brother why did you make that decision he said where everybody's going there that means there is something ahead that is hindering others to go on the other land which has no Cs and when we reached ahead we found there was actually no problem on the other land but the only reason why people took the other crowded land was that everybody thought as long as people are going on this landan it means that is the right and that's the problem we have in the world today people want to take popular [Music] opinion people want to decide what others have decided before it's very difficult for people to take personal decision it's very difficult for people to have personal choices but I said you it pays off to have a personal choice to have a personal decision and this year I want to have a personal decision to follow Jesus Christ even if all others are not following him I want to follow him and so Paul said be you followers of me amen can I have more voice more sound even as even I even as I also am of Christ follow me as I follow Christ now the thing here Paul was pointing people to Christ he was listen he was not pointing people to himself or to his church or to his organization are you listening to me he was pointing people to Jesus Christ can we say Amen to that there's some things I want to deal with tonight and so now I'd like I want you to hear this from the message my commission he says can I say something from my heart if it is all right there are some people went forth and and had strange feelings in their hand afterwards the prophet of God is speaking about the gift he had the gift he had in his hand that he would if he would sleep his hand in the in the hand of the other person then the other person would begin listen to feel a few things in their hand and so what would happen would be that this person would feel different and uh then they would feel strange feelings after they touched the hand of the prophet and they got the wrong impression they got thinking you heal people by some feeling that you had in your hand many would come to me and say brother bham feel and see if I got healing power brother Solomon are you following me here feel and see if if if I if I have healing power because they begin to feel some strange feeling no he says no I will tell you now you haven't the only healing power there is lays in Christ Jesus do you know there are many people today many many uh so-called prophets that feel that they anointed differently than others and people pay money to meet them they feel they are so anointed and they are so much on demand that they need to be rewarded for their anointing and so here was a man that was really anointed in our generation and he told these people who kind of felt that they had a feeling in their [Music] hand he says do I have power brother touch me and what as a prophet tell me do I have healing power because I feel different in my he says I will tell you now you don't have it the only healing power that there is it relays in Jesus Christ that's right that is all the only thing that you can do is to point people to that and that's all I can do all anyone else can do is to point people to Jesus Christ who has already healed them listen listen Church in other words that there is no person on the world today that has different powers or strong powers or healing powers are you following me whether it's a pastor a prophet a preacher prophetes there is no one with special powers you did not say Amen do you believe that no man no woman has special power there is only one special power and that is in Jesus Christ he's the only one with power so in another if we don't if any religion listen if any religion if any worship If any man of God any church does not Point people to Jesus Christ it is not worth following we should only follow that which points us to Jesus Christ we should follow a church that points out to Jesus Christ we should follow a move or a movement that points out to Jesus Christ and let me tell you anything that does not point to to Christ pointing to a man somewhere he to a man in America poting to a man in Congo poting to a man in camon to a man in Uganda but let me tell you we in this message by the grace of God we have been removed from such system amen we have been brought in a place amen let me tell you about our religion let me tell you about our religion what we believe in is that this message is pointing us to one thing and that is Jesus Christ and anything without Christ is dead but I'm so glad they have been pointed to Jesus Christ I'm so glad I've been pointed to Christ listen from the message God has has a provided way a minister couldn't save no one you may say well what about an anointed man of what about what about somebody who has an anointing someone who has a you know a powerful preaching Ministry it says a minister couldn't save no one even our Prophet cannot save you brother bam cannot serve no are you following me he's a man of God but he cannot save you he's a prophet of Our Generation he cannot save you what about me your pastor I cannot save you we've seen churches that follow their pastors as a Creed as a as a Dogma they follow them that that they will do everything they doing say everything they saying that is good in the part but let me tell you if you are Pastor even if it is myself if I'm teaching you something that is not pointing to Christ then I'm leading you to myself a minister cannot save no one he could only preach the gospel if he's anointed of the Holy Spirit and he will Point people to the place where they were saved a place where they were saved where they were saved listen to me me a minister an anointed ministry will point you to a place where you were saved not he is not to save you he comes to show you that is the place where you were saved do you know the place where you were saved 2,000 years ago on Calvary when Jesus shed his blood for us that is the place where we were saved I am not saved yesterday I am not saved today I was saved amen 2,000 years ago when Jesus died for me and he paid the price and the and the anointed Ministry point you to that a place where they were sa at Calvary have listen listen you have to accept it as your personal savior now in order to have benefits dividence of of his death and enjoy the attributes of what he died for Hallelujah that's why you know Paul said follow me as I follow Christ even because he was pointing them to Christ he was pointing them to Christ but what we have today we have places that they call holy places we have water they call Holy Water we have oil they call Holy oil holy person can you imagine there is a man here they call his holiness his Holiness the that is a fallacy that's not truth come on brother prach it's not the truth fallacy thank God for the message of because we have been redeemed out of lives no man is Holy in such a way that Holiness is in them there is only one that is Holy and that is God there is no Holy Mountain there is no holy water there is no holy place there is noly person there is only a holy God and anything that God is in that is a holy thing amen and why do they call themselves holy because they want to take the place of God how do you know God is in something when Christ is in it when they receive the word Christ where is Christ Christ is in his own word amen but they deny the word and they claim to have Christ in them they deny the word and the women become preachers the Bible is very clear a woman is not supposed to be a preacher or a pastor but they make themselves pastors and they claim to be holy that is a lie because the word is not in them and when Jesus Christ came on the earth he looked at them and he said you are not holy you are not even of Moses you not even of Abraham and they were offended but listen what did he tell them he said because you reject me the word is not in you they had to accept him this generation has to accept god listen brother sister if what you are doing if your life does not show Christ Christ is not in you if you the life you're living the thoughts you are thinking the works you are doing whether you are seen or you are not seen if it cannot be identified by the word Christ is not in you and if Christ is not in you you will not go to the Rapture I want to go to the Rapture I want to go to the Rapture I don't want to remain here I want to be holy even as he is Holy that's why he said be ye holy even as I am Holy God is the only holy and he wants us to be holy even as he is Holy how can we be holy receiving the Holy Ghost when you receive a holy ghost you you become holy praise the name of the Lord and in the message ConEd and then concerned he says there is no holy people there is no Holy Mountain there is no holy church there are churches here today that tell us if you are not a member of the Catholic church if you're not a member the church why do you think that we have many churches and each of these churches claim to be the ones that are right but each of those churches teach the Bible differ the Catholic Church will tell you you know what you need to do is to believe there is one holy man on Earth and his name is the pope he represent Jesus Christ and also you have to believe that you can actually tell the priests your sins and they will actually forgive you and they are saying we are the only church we are the only true church even Catholic means Universal they the only they The Universal Church of Jesus where do you find that where do you find in the Bible that priests cannot marry but the Bible says in the book of First Timothy that these people have doctrines of devils where they forbid people to marry do of devils in hypocrisy because they forbid people to marry and again they have children what is that Christ is not in that and then they other come they say no we are the only right ones and they say but you know what we believe you cannot eat pork you cannot eat this you canot eat that but what does Jesus say his word he says those people who have do of devils they also forbid people to eat some meat so what is that it's also not correct can be in and then comes the anglicans where they will say well we the only right Church they the ones who protested but what do they do they baptize babies where do you find that in the Bible and then another will come P I am the right one all the others are wrong and what will they do they would say well we baptizing much father holy show me one person in the Bible that was baptized in much water in father son Holy Spirit everyone that was baptized was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and so that is not the only the church but yet each of them claim to be the right church and the holy church but let me tell you God Has Lifted up a stand and showed what his Holiness Jesus is not in a church not a denomination when any church denominates that church dies God does not walk behind a denomination God is Not led by a denomination where is God he is in Christ where is Christ Christ is in his word and whever his word is preached that is where Christ is and we have the message of the hour what is the message the message is Christ coming down in the end time calling people out of the systems of out of the denominations Hallelujah are you one of them he has called us out where are we we are out of the denominations we are higher than the nominations we have the eego anointing we we are flying higher come on church we are flying higher we are not down low we are up higher where are we going are going in Rapture soon we are going to meet the Lord in and what about others even in the message they are trying to denominate even in the message they try to bring those attitudes our church is the only CH our church is the only CH when you see that Spirit I'm telling you run from that spirit in the message we have no denomination in the message we have one Church The Universal Church of Jesus Christ where is it it is not a physical Church it is a mystical body come on Church it can be seen everywhere oh glory to God come and preach with me tonight there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all afame their hearts are on fire you cannot find them in one place where scattered near and everywhere in the world in Uganda Zimbabwe they are in Tanzania in Ethiopia they everywhere they have one Pastor their Pastor Jesus Jesus Christ they all Bap in Jesus name glory to God we are no longer under a denomination we are no longer under system of we have been pointed to Jesus Christ your neighbor been pointed to Jesus Christ enough of those religious demons we are under the system of the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah praise God we are not under a system of man and that's why I always say in the message what do we have we have one church but many fellowships every where they are they our brothers they part of the body some are 50 here others 100 others 500 2,000 other 10,000 all of us together all over the world we are the body of Jesus Christ so there is no holy people no Holy Mountain holy God in the people a holy God in the people that is why friends we don't need to find God on a mountain somewhere it's okay to go to a Prayer Mountain we don't need to find God on a mountain somewhere that God is no longer just on the mountain the god of the mountain is the god of the valley The God Who is on the mountain he's a God who can come down in a valley where you are and he will meet you at the place of your he's a God as long as he's in a place then it's a holy place we don't find him in a four W building called a church we don't find him only in one religion one church or one sect or one group we have denom we have churches Church names days of the voice Fellowship days of the voice fellowship and we think that is great spoken word tacle spoken word Tabernacle Holy Spirit fire Holy Spirit evening light that's powerful Nam but it's nothing we have very many remind me the names ex Church give me the names that's a powerful name right give me come on SN white oh my God powerful come on give oh my God there is even one who had another Touch come on give me name restor Faith oh my God rest and all these names are power are you hearing me and it is getting into the heads of people until you think if someone is not a member of dvf is not a Believer if you have that attitude that is a spirit from Hell On You any believer that has been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and has the Holy Ghost amen is a child of God a Son of God no matter where they go for fellow and that's what we believe that's what we stand for this message has pointed us not to one man not to one p not to One Church appointed us to Jesus Christ if whatever you are eating whatever youting after eating it it makes you feel your group is the only right one you have eaten poison whatever you eat will make you believe you are one little p on a beach but there are many other PES it will make you feel you are not the only body but you are part of the body that's what we believe the body of Christ is a a mystical body and because some of us because in our fellowship we see it better whatever better we see it it is only a good God that has allowed us to see that way don't forget there another fellowship that also sees it better and another one that sees it better but all these fellowships before Jesus Christ are really on the same level if we are going to have a Rapture there is no good Rapture and better Rapture come on bride we have one Rapture for all the believer if you filled with the Holy Ghost you are going to go in the Rapture no matter where you Fellowship you don't need to join dvf to goap you don't need to leave your church to go inap wherever you are you may be a member of evening life you will go Rapture that way you may be me of rapt that you may be in Zim brother you don't need to come to whever you are the Raptor is going to come to you why because the Holy Ghost is in you hallelujah hallelujah that's what we believe we don't find one man we don't find him in one man he is in a many membered body and that's why you feel you find men that God has used so powerfully over when they begin to feel that they are the best the ones with the better Revelation than others and they begin to look down on other preachers what happens they form a cult they kind of begin to feel indifferent when another brother comes from another fellowship they can't even say God bless you because this one is not am on lower than me and me that attitude is not from Heaven it is from Lucifer the attitude we should have should be this we are all children of God we are hairs with the father we are joint ha with the son and soon and very soon we are going to see the king Hallelujah and every man's labors will be rewarded there should be no divisions in the body as human beings we have different opinions we have different ways we see different things one Pastor will see one thing differently another will something differ doesn't make one holier than the other it just makes us human and that's why a prophet would say that every human being should find a church that you will call a home church where you comfortable where you are fed where your spirit is at peace where you you know you are eating something which is going to prepare for and then he also said then you dis Fellowship all the other churches you just Fellowship them did he that then he said but don't dis Fellowship the other man visit them when you when you can they're your brothers but we but have a church homeall a place where you pay your ti a place where you support the cause a place where you attend physically service that's a church home Hallelujah but that doesn't make you special it makes you special just like the other brother is speci what what how did denominations form denominations formed by putting a full stop on the Revelation the prophet of God would say here in thean church age if God didn't write a handbook of Creeds and formulas andas to start it to start the church then what right did they have to do to do to do that God powered out his Spirit upon Baptists Methodist Nazar advian Church of God sever so named all these Brethren were brought up on different doctrines by laws Church mans Etc God swept it all onto one side God found all these denominations having their Church manuals by laws and constitutions God took it all he swept it all to one side and he destroyed their dispensational theories and He restored the gift of the spirit proing is the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah but did those Pentecostal learn their lesson about Organization no sir they organiz right back again and they have their written they have written their own textbooks byw and church manual fellowship with one idea in mind which is to prove that they now have all the truth know all the answers for theight of God who know the way show itto us as God is appointed guides if you felt that way you are on the wrong PA there is no one who has all the answers there is no church who have all the answers there is no Pastor who has all the answers there is no organization who has all the answers only christes every dispens message every Prophet every messenger every true God people to one see that is Christ and why is the message true because the message has no full stop our Prophet told us we believe everything God has revealed plus everything he will reveal our God is unquenchable our God has more in him there is no Full Stop on this message and this message does not point us to William this message does not point us to Jefferson this message points us to Christ that is why it is true that's why I believe it that's why I press it because it is life because is a living God but they haven't got the people they have hybridized themselves like the very groups they came out of if they want to be in the bride they are going to have to come out exactly as their their father did they are like the rest the Revival is over they are trying to leave a name and are dead they took organization all the while talking about the spirit of God they talk about the evidence of the of the Holy Spirit but they forget that the devil can talk T too the confusion of B is in their M and they call it the spirit of now here brother was addressing the pentec by denomination because because they speak in Tong then they felt they are the only right ones but God always has more now even now let us leave even the Pentecost not even in the message oh because God filled people with the Holy Ghost in our church the only right ones but because we cry and Shout the only right because the spirit of God moves in our fellow we are the only right ones everywhere else God is Not There is dead that's the spirit of organization it's not the spirit of the message God does what he wants to do when he want you want to do it I saw the disciples when they saw people casting out demons they ran to Jesus and they said Jesus do you see what happened we found people casting out demons in your name should we stop them Jesus said come on why do you have to stop them are not against us they are for us and let me tell you Church any brother sister who believes what we believe is our brother is our sister when you meet them on the road when you meet them at the airport when you meet them in another country tell them God bless you Hallelujah where do we find Christ brother bam says in what is in what is that in your hand he says and that's the reason that I try to get people before the person nothing in the individual nothing in the individual [Music] thee yes it is in Christ and Christ is in his word do you believe that everybody say Christ is in his work he is identified by his own characteristics praise the name of the Lord but what happens we we have preachers and people and especially preachers who preach to point people to themselves you find it even in local churches thank God for preachers we have here we thank God for the preachers we have here we just point to Christ but if imagine if Brother Martin came to preach and the impression he left after preaching that it is brother martin you have to follow if if brother Prince came here and it's now brother prince who is the real deal brother Marin m is the man if after you preach that's the impression then you never preached you point people to yourself I don't care how powerful you are I don't care how much work you've done for God if after you preach the impression is people must follow you then there's a problem with your ministry what should be the impression impression should be Christ when Paul preached Paul made us fall in love with Jesus Christ when William BR pra he made us to fall in love with Jesus Christ I pray that whenever I preach I should make you to fall in love with Christ out there in the denominations you need to hear the testimonies you know I was this I was that but the man of [Music] what kind of man of God that you're talking about that you can't even remember his La tell us Jesus Christ through the man of God not the man of God not my pastor my Bishop what God did this is the attitude I want us to have here in second let me show you let me show you one preacher who was always pointing to himself samel 15 from verse one because of time I only read in English in luganda and it came to pass after this that absolum prepared his chariots and horses and 50 men to run before him and absolum Rose up early and Stood Beside the way of the Gat and it was so that when en man had that had that that had a controversy came to the king for judgment then Absalom came unto him and said of what city are at thou and he said thy servant is is of one of the tribes of Israel and absum said unto him see thy matters are good and right but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee so absam said moreover oh that I were made judge in the land that every man who which which has any suit or cause might come unto me and I would do him Justice and it was so that when any man came n to him to do obeses he put forth his hand and took him and kissed him and on this manner did absolum to all Israel that came to the king for judgment so absolum stole the hearts of the men of Israel and we have a lot of pastors my goodness let one person make a mistake to attend their Fellowship don't never see again any other man as a man of [Music] God people were coming to see the king and abs positioned himself at the gate when you would see someone coming what can how can I help and the person would talk about and then he would say you are good and you are right but he said there's no one to hear you the king is busy I wish I was the one who was you know helping you you know if I was the one in your case it would have been different pastors that make you feel that if it is not them you are going to hell some of them actually you come to me and tell me Pastor I feel led of the Lord to to go join lifebo Church what did you say brother did you know that I'm anointed for you did you know if you live here actually going on your way to did you know you under C that's a wrong Spirit of ab it doesn't point to Christ it points to himself says if it was me in your would have been better but I I have that opportunity and man did a mistake to put forth his hand to do he give him respect AB would take pull it to himself and kiss in other words he would imprint himself so that by the time the person leaves the only thing he's thinking about is ABS I wish he was the king and the King absum thought the king would lose popularity and we s we find that because of that absolom sto the hearts of the we have a lot of preachers who want to steal men's when they have an opportunity to minister they want to prove a point the best preacher there is one preacher I found I have told you of him before he mounted the pulpit saying I'm when whenever I go great things happen Wherever I Go miracles happen whenever I preach the devil is I'm telling you today you're going to be because I am here I was there in the chair I almost asked the grand to swallow me but I held on I said God maybe the man of God is a little PR but maybe you're going to use I am ready Lord and I open my heart and by the time he left the he came in so powerfully he left so defe let me tell you say the Way Up Is Down Down is up you want God to use you for humble yourself don't try to Ste people's hearts it is me when I'm done with you everything will be okay as long as you are here know these Pentecostals people go to their churches and and they will tell them hallelujah hallelujah I'm seeing the real of the spirit that someone was bewitching there is even a c Aunt here person begins fear thank God you are here if you if you had not come you are going to die tomorrow now God is telling the is broken now from today always come here and that's how they get members people join them because of fear if you are here because of fear go we want people to come here who are interested of the word of the of the word of the hour we want people who to come interested in Jesus Christ interested in the Rapture hallelujah amen that's why we preach Don't Preach to show you we are great men we are nothing we just preachers of the Gospel we are just his loud speaker to magnify his voice to you other than that we are nothing if the greatest pre in the world said without him I'm nothing how much more us and he sto the people's hearts so now that you come to DF evening I make sure that you do not go to another church church wrong Spirit may come because every church has come on Sir spirit let the people come because it is in their heart to come if everybody comes to church because they want to come the Holy Ghost is bound to fall has to come if you come because you want to come God will visit you if you come because you desire God you receive God because the only thing we give amen and a prophet would say here is our Prophet now of this generation his name is William BR God used this man more than any other man in this generation but here is what he said I'm quoting not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization I have never done that and I will not do that now I have no interest in those things but these days one one fellow another Mage will fall you are fishing from my bucket begin blows but our Prophet said I never brought this message a for people to join my church follow me I am going to fight with all that is in me if one brother backslides to the [Music] world but even if all of you left me today and joined evening I'm talking to you and all of you streaming members of here I'll be happy I'll continue preaching and others will come and if God I'll just say if God you have allowed me bring to fish them out of the world so they can go somewhere else to grow Pastor do you mean it yes I do I have another heaven to take it do I have a special heav to take you to there's only one Heaven that you are taking people to and every preacher who is preaching the truth is taking them to that same heav but we believe to stay in the fellowship as a member of that Fellowship it is going to be your personal decision and when you do that decision stay right with this be confident be in one place listen to the voice of God with all your heart don't be too UNF there some Believers like that brother what is your fellow I'm everywhere not believe in fls if you float you will not grow because every Ministry has its Grace and when you submit yourself under a Ministry do that with all your heart and then God will mature you under that Ministry because he says he has sent that Shepherd praise the name of the Lord I have no interest in those things but I do have interest in the things of God and people I have interest in people also and in the things of God and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and man wherein men become New Creations in Christ filled with his spirit and living according to his word and I would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to even as I trust in my heart I have given my all to him God bless you and may his coming rejoice and that's the reason why we organize youth meetings they coming from everywhere we estimated about 450 because the registrations had issues but we had much more than from more than n countries and streaming from all over the world what is the it is not to draw crowds to D see a generation a generation that is having a spiritual encounter with God since the youth meetings I've been receiving testimonies after testimon great things God has done many count all over the world maybe I'll read a few for you along the way but I tell you God is God and when he raises a Ministry any man is Raising you by the princess any man he will raise you had a testim pastor any man he will raise raing for one purpose not to have a following but to bring people into a spiritual Encounter With Jesus Christ Hallelujah God bless you may stand on your Fe hallelujah hallelujah pointing people to Christ Gody Lord Jesus that's our desire Point people to Christ bless every listener tonight that they will feel enriched in their soul feel closer to Jesus Christ oh God that we will know this message is greater than us is more than us it is Christ revealed to us in this house this is not a

that opportunity if you want to come here and us in one minute hallelujah praise God um actually I just felt the need to be rebap tized my name is Aisha I spent um most of my life um away from Uganda so I I got born again in the UK in my formative years in my fortive years okay so I also served in Ministry for three years but then along the way I had some tragic events and I've not been back to serving the lord but here in Uganda I bless God for the for the reward of the day know yeah because I had um a problem with finding okay I I fellowshipped at uh Christian Life Ministry I had a problem of finding the right church because of some of the words that is it Pastor tamale you know we tend to be following the men of God uh that are pointing to themselves an old reference is to them like he preached and he said for example you hear people say the god of the man I don't want to say name of names names I don't think it's right because the Bible says that we overcome the um by the testimony so when we're giving testimon we have to give glory to God but we just uh we just thank for the vess that's being used we appreciate the V that's used I find um certain phrases Al Born Again In the Pentecostal Church I'll testify when God I'll testify if God does this so we just depended on him because he gives us visas he he heals us he delivers us but we're supposed to follow him in good and in bad and that our identity Jesus Christ but not what we have or who we follow so bless you for the word today amen amen we appreciate this sister Aisha it was certainly God who led you to meet our brother Andrew and I know he has more in store for you amen I also have my father-in-law here if you can to the people God bless amen so uh we'll just sing one song as we give our offerings and as
