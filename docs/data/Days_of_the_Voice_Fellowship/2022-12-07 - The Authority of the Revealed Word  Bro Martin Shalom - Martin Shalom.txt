precious Lord Jesus Lord how we love you tonight we thank you for your master your grace [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] example amen amen are we in Luke chapter 7 Lucas we're reading from buses from bus one we have enough time to go from us amen you're in the name of the Lord Jesus no way in the old oh now when he had ended all his way in the audience of the people in England now understand some Curious who was there unto him was sorry now when he had already attended all this way in the audience of the people the end of the new governor [Music] and when he and when the Heart of Jesus he said unto him the Elders of the Jews he's setting him that he will come and help his father and when they came to Jesus they saw 10 years not to say that he was one me for a whole issue to do this for he loving our nation and he had built us a circle that Jesus went with them and when he was now not far from the house as a shield sent friend to him saying unto him Lord trouble not thyself for I am not worthy that thou should thou should enter under my roof wherefore neither thou I myself wanted to come unto thee but saying inwards and my servant shall be healed for uh for I also am a man said other authority under me soldiers and I say unto one go and he go and another account has been coming and myself and do this and he do and he do everything when Jesus had to say and turn him above and say unto the people that follow him I said unto you I have not found so connecting no not in Israel together in your garage correlation [Music] foreign uh yesterday I already gave you um blessed Jesus Lord we thank you once again I pray that Lord May the Holy Spirit come and give us inspiration because [Music] foreign amen amen and they were astonished at his Doctrine for he taught them as one that had Authority and not as the slaves I mean amen thank you now my uh my sharing tonight [Music] [Music] [Music] was dear unto him was sick and ready to death by the time the Bible says that it was seen that ready to die of old names [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord [Music] [Applause] in balance [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] when Jesus was preaching yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and come on come on Amen and where they came to Jesus saying that he was wealthy or whom he should do this [Music] this man was a good man he had killed the temples the Bible says I believe that amen so he was a good man he was full of good work but Mindy was not a Jew praise be to God but this man believed in Jesus so when his servant was sick and he heard about Jesus he knew that if we come into an encounter with that man and they sent him and for he loveth our nation they were still giving that Testament about this man and he has peeled our Senegal then Jesus went with them when you call Jesus Jesus will not hesitate he is to take their questions he will go with you praise the Lord amen I mean every time you call on him Jesus as long as you trust him as long as you believe in him he will respond so fast so Jesus followed him praise be to God and then Jesus went with him and when he was now not far from uh from the house the security sent a friend to him saying unto him Lord trouble not thyself remember you had sent for him for I'm not worry that thou should thou shouldest enter under my roof how many like this man tonight Jesus I'm not worrying perfect weakness when we think that we are able when we think that we are somebody that's when we are nothing but when we reach in such a point wherever you call for Jesus you send for Jesus and when it comes you should come under my room that's the only time when God will do something for us foreign that when Jesus had this saying yes he marveled at him but we know and turned him about it and say that other people that followed him I say unto you I have not found so great faith foreign [Applause] foreign for he told them as one that had Authority foreign but the truth is Jesus had Authority yes amen and not as the scribes praise you to God yes sir not as the intellectuals me now praise you to God amen praise the Lord praise the Lord so Jesus had Authority yesterday because I believe he was that he was not revealed it was the word manifested the word became flesh the very one which was spoken in the beginning amen the one which which created in the beginning and that's why Jesus did not played with the demons because he was the word in flesh he just spoke with authorities amen he no speak like the Pharisees they speak about his history foreign [Music] Philip he asked he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man I am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist and some Elias and others Jeremiahs or one of the prophets that is and it says unto them but whom say ye that I am Peter answered and said Thou Art Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed thou Simon by Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will peel my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it [Music] amen and I will give us the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven foreign shall be born in heaven is shall be loosed in heaven remember we are speaking about the authority of the revealed when the world is revealed to us when the world is revealed to you you have that Authority nothing can hinder you amen because you have known what you are praise me to God when God when it was revealed to Peter Jesus told him that blood and flesh did not reveal that to you yes but my father rather we are living in that time when the world is swallowing in darkness when there is a group of people God himself has revealed himself to them that group is saying that in the last few days [Applause] golden was your fortune amen Mina what will put the pride in her place Spirit and the words because she will recognize her position in the world then she is in Christ will put her in her place praise be to God when we recognize the message of our days when this world is revealed to us this word is spirit and life amen and this world will put us in our rightful place we are the pride of Christ be to God Amen is like the policeman standing out here in the street police the message is greater than someone is here little fellow with a cup pulled down over his ears foreign but I pray that God gives us the grace amen you pray for we pray for both both of us amen it says like a little it's like a little policeman standing out here in the street police down over his ears we are about a hundred pounds by sticking on him and here comes a bunch of cars down the road doing a hundred miles an hour each one of them four or five hundred horsepower and he couldn't stop one of them but let him hold up the hands amen man and he has got Authority [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign busy but by Jesus Christ that is the reason devil screams images but because we have a story time amen I just want us to know tonight there are many things happening around us we are in December 21 December the year is ending is there many things you have not accomplished probably this year has been so bad for you until you feel like quitting but remember when I told you when we join this Army amen there is no quitting there's no retreating praise you to God amen praise the Lord he said this Authority is that we have authority given to us by Jesus Christ amen even this evening we have opened to reverse the situation around us we can still change things if we know who we are between truly praise be to God Amen because we have a message do you believe that it is who is on the Lord's Side here he says let him come under this world come under this world the church the word pray his ministry in this in his pride of where is which is his birthday rather than we have authority is sometimes look at your weaknesses I request brother Deacon to move around amen there are times we say that when we come to church we come to worship we come to pray we come to serve God the prophet says this minister is in his pride which is his body praise be to God amen amen the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God that's his own mouthpiece so God is turning God is standing on her America found her through the prophet and the prize for the voice of God will be anyhow the voice of God will be in the prize amen God uses your eyes to that um just pick the world Amen foreign [Music] foreign [Music] he will stand foreign but our fathers when they knew that they live in tense Amen in a message from that time we say that I'm stepping in a higher Ministry of speaking the world are you stepping there now the highness of speaking the word I will not call Pastor when your a pastor pray for me I'm dying but we realize I'm stepping into a higher Ministry I believe there is a church on it is [Music] I just feel like shouting he says man will speak the word praise be to God amen Amina I'm on my road we are on our way we are that church be to God Jesus paid for everything yes you told him I've given you the keys there is no bad luck that can repel when Jesus gives you that key there is no situation whatever you lose I don't care what you're losing tonight because you are given that King whatever you lose whatever you are binding tonight God is find everything that you don't want every table whatever the bride will ask [Music] [Music] because when you realize omnipotence speaks guess what happened in a message when the eyes were open [Music] and by the time she realizes oh but I want to tell you for God it will save you from one hand it is also a Miracles praise be to God there is no Miracle like a sinful Soul filled with the Holy Ghost that is the greatest Miracle ever say that you may be healed by disease after some time forever [Music] she is flesh of his flesh when part of response life of his life she is [Music] you are born of Christ born of Christ to watch amen you are power of his power holyman life of his life and you are him [Music] and if you are him what does Christ do Christians pray for the sake amen love unlovable pray all the night praise in the mountains speaks the words of encouragement raising the dead making the lamb walk anytime we don't see those things because we have not known whom we are and we don't mean when you come praise be to God amen remember when he spoke to them in the temple speaks like the one with authority is that God does not speak Laos the words every time he speaks he means what he says that's why he speaks with authorities that's why he comes there sick for 28 years 38 years he asked him what are you doing here you know you see when the angel comes we are preparing to magnetically Goku and it was in bad State he does not come and sympathize with her yes [Music] you will be a rich man in the city but now look at your soul now look at you all the sickness the sickness so bad do you know why he had made a provided way for them praise be to God so that's why it was a rebuke what are you doing here amen Jesus never wanted to express foreign he says that now God is depending on you as a member of his body yes it's depending on you yes let us let us open up our channels and let the Holy Spirit come in tonight and energizes us you just open your channels because God is depending in his church so let us open our channels the Holy Spirit comes tonight amen and energizes us and free us from our uh free us from all these fears and doubts revivals praise be to God we are fears and doubts you fear to receive the Holy Spirit

when a tropical Pizza could order you to park us on the roadside whether you like it or not you will park praise be to God just because you fear penalty when you impose law upon the Devil he will have to obey I did not go under he will have to give it back and he has to do it because we can take God's Edge and the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit go right down on our knees and say that says he has got to give it up and that is all praise be to God God has a law enforce the Holy Spirit when we go on our knees it means this law is only applicable that's where the Holy Ghost is [Applause] when

Christ Crystal will have to be operating in his church to make them concise together at the rapture praise be to God this world has Authority that's what makes difference it's not just a book of History the domination they refused to read the word to believe the word because the world will make them drop their ideas but when it comes the bride of Christ the word puts us back to our rightful position amen amen if you read Philippians chapter 4 verses 19 we're not going to read There is this word has Authority we stand in this world and we claim for that Authority praise be to God first

Lord amen we've been told a lot of things today about our Authority a traffic a traffic of officer has Authority but has no power necessarily the power of the tropical Feast I cannot stop the car if a trailer comes and if he or she tries to use her power they'll just knock her down but she uses the authority that she has so you may be weak the Bible says let the weak say let the week say so if you are weak it's not your strength remember that it's not your strength that is going to do it it is the authority that you have been given each of us has Authority as a a living daughter and son of God

of Christ Lord maybe this has been an encouragement to someone here who has been feeling low and feeling defeated and maybe sick in the body and weak and feeling that within them they can accomplish nothing father we've been reminded it's not about our strength it's about the authority which we have received because of who we are we are Sons and Daughters of God we are adopted into your kingdom and by virtue of that fact Lord we possess a lot of authority whereby we can claim and enforce all our god-given promises the devil has no right to keep any promise of God it never has no right to keep healing away from us the devil has no right to keep provision away from us the devil has no right to keep all our desires that we have because we have a right to claim every one of them and father maybe someone has been tormented by the devil in our midst Lord father we destroy the work of the devil in the name of Jesus and Saturn we command you to leave the people and may everyone be set free Lord may not want people be in our midst tonight because of your word which you have sent to us may it be a battle to each of us father Lord we remember to pray for our sisters teller who us
