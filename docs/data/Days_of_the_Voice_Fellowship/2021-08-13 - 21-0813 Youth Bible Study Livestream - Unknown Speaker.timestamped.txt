[9:23] tonight yes
[9:27] so uh
[9:28] i just uh wanted to
[9:31] say i appreciate
[9:33] the the brothers that uh
[9:37] have
[9:37] been
[9:39] uh
[9:40] at the church
[9:42] praying
[9:45] and then and then sharing the word
[9:48] i think about the mafia indeed share the
[9:49] word today
[9:50] uh that was quite impressive i i did not
[9:52] hear that listen to the role of it but i
[9:54] listen to a question i will complete it
[9:57] uh but i think if people need to start
[9:58] me studying for us sir
[10:00] this is really good
[10:02] so
[10:03] have been missing those meetings please
[10:05] go there go there
[10:07] uh when when you usually meet brother
[10:10] on friday yeah it is not streamed at all
[10:12] but uh so those who want to be a part of
[10:15] it on friday what time
[10:18] nine a.m
[10:20] yeah nine a.m up to what time
[10:23] what when is the sharing
[10:27] 11 11 a.m in the morning
[10:29] and then
[10:30] you are they're always there praying and
[10:33] and uh trying to avoid food so that they
[10:36] can be in the presence of god
[10:38] and they pray and they wait upon god and
[10:41] they share the word encourage one
[10:42] another that's really good
[10:45] so only that those who want to be a part
[10:48] of it you have to let me know what they
[10:50] said but they don't know don't just go
[10:52] because the chances are not yet open
[10:54] so we don't want to have everybody going
[10:56] and then we have issues uh later on so
[10:59] we don't want to have that
[11:01] if you want to go and be a part of it
[11:03] let us know so we can be sure to include
[11:05] you on the list
[11:06] to know that you are going to go so that
[11:08] you can see how to do it
[11:10] but i want to appreciate you brothers
[11:11] who have been making that happen and
[11:13] praying and also i believe you pray for
[11:15] this program that's usually very very
[11:17] good
[11:19] you know
[11:19] this without prayer cannot get us
[11:22] anywhere
[11:23] and
[11:24] i also thank god that we have a few who
[11:26] have gathered here uh you know the words
[11:29] i speak sometimes they speak it
[11:31] intentionally to prune out those who are
[11:33] not willing to come
[11:35] and then those who are willing to come
[11:37] i'm sure they will always come
[11:39] and when they when you come like this
[11:41] and you're willing and you're ready and
[11:43] you have the desire then i'm sure that
[11:45] god has to bless you amen
[11:48] uh i also
[11:50] see sister
[11:52] uh peace here and there's suffolk
[11:58] why are they not here again
[12:01] why are you streaming why not here
[12:08] sorry we are not yelling
[12:13] you know before you you talk you have to
[12:18] yes you cannot talk
[12:27] ah did anyone hear what they say
[12:30] no nothing so
[12:32] we're not here i don't know why but uh
[12:34] maybe your volume or something is
[12:37] you know not connected well
[12:39] so we wanted to know why why did they
[12:41] come
[12:43] this is unfortunate do you do you know
[12:45] the reason
[12:47] um
[12:56] at this time so
[12:58] well like i said i'm happy if two people
[13:01] come here when they are in for reach
[13:04] where they are brave i'm beginning to
[13:06] think that those ones who are trying to
[13:07] skip reading are going to be trying to
[13:10] use the strategy of streaming
[13:12] and then we shall also if you try if you
[13:14] try to stream unless you go on um
[13:18] on youtube if you try to stream and you
[13:20] are part of this discussion we will
[13:22] always start with you and have you talk
[13:24] and have you tell us where you have
[13:25] reached and tell us what you have read
[13:27] if you are not reading then maybe also
[13:29] resume your escape and then you will go
[13:31] to the youtube
[13:32] and then maybe if you are there and then
[13:34] you get more then you disappear
[13:36] completely
[13:37] the purpose is not to chase you out but
[13:39] the purpose is to really have you be
[13:41] serious if you're serious for this we
[13:43] want you to be a part of this but if you
[13:45] do not want to be a part of it we don't
[13:47] want to force you we don't want to force
[13:49] anybody to be a part of this please put
[13:50] that off
[13:51] so uh
[13:53] since i uh
[13:55] i want to begin with those who are
[13:56] online please can you ensure that it
[13:58] works out because we cannot hear what

[14:05] breached from what you've been reading
[14:06] so that you can we can start from there

[20:21] my leading angel
[20:24] okay reads start reading right now
[20:28] salutation
[20:31] revelation 2 verse 8. you see these
[20:34] things say the lord
[20:37] says the first
[20:38] and the last which was dead and is alive
[20:42] the first and the last witch
[20:45] was dead and is alive
[20:47] now these are not the words of a man a
[20:50] mere man
[20:51] could he speak from the grave
[20:54] would say i am the first and the last
[20:58] which was alive and is dead
[21:01] the first thing that happens to a man
[21:03] is that he's born
[21:05] he's alive
[21:06] and the last thing that happens
[21:08] is that he dies
[21:10] so this is not a man speaking this is
[21:12] deity
[21:14] man adam took life and turned it into
[21:18] death
[21:19] but this man
[21:23] jesus
[21:25] took death and turned it
[21:28] and turned it into life adam took
[21:31] innocence
[21:32] and turned it into guilt
[21:34] this one took guilt and turned it into
[21:36] righteousness
[21:38] adam took a paradise and turned it into
[21:40] a waste holding a waste
[21:43] holy wilderness but this one
[21:47] is coming back to turn and earth rocking
[21:51] and reeling with destruction into
[21:53] another
[21:55] adam took a life of fellowship and joy
[21:57] with god and turned it into a desert in
[22:00] the spiritual darkness that brought
[22:02] forth all sin
[22:04] more decay pain suffering delusion and
[22:06] corruption
[22:08] that was within the souls of men
[22:11] but this one
[22:12] from all that tragic death and
[22:15] degradation
[22:16] that filled mankind brought forth a life
[22:19] of righteousness and beauty
[22:22] so that as sin once reigned unto death
[22:26] even so might men now reign in
[22:28] righteousness the one christ jesus
[22:32] and not as the offence was
[22:34] not terrible indeed it was but now much
[22:38] more is his gift
[22:39] and to eternal life
[22:42] and here and here he is
[22:44] walking in the midst of those
[22:47] whom he has redeemed
[22:48] even his church
[22:50] and what were those who are redeemed
[22:54] were not many like paul mothers and
[22:56] corrupters
[22:58] or not many like the dying thief rather
[23:00] than main killers
[23:03] all trophies of his grace
[23:05] all brought back from the dead all made
[23:08] alive in christ jesus the lord i wonder
[23:11] if you noted the salutation to the first
[23:14] edge and they noted that i want to this
[23:16] age just put them together
[23:19] these things say three that holds the
[23:22] seven stars in the in his right hand and
[23:25] walks in the midst
[23:28] of the churches
[23:29] these things
[23:31] say
[23:31] the first and the last which was dead
[23:33] and is alive
[23:35] this is one and the same person
[23:38] and he is letting us know that the
[23:40] church is his
[23:42] as the seed of the fruit
[23:44] is in the midst of the fruit so
[23:47] is he
[23:48] the royal seed in the midst of the
[23:50] church
[23:51] and the seed
[23:59] as the seed alone has life in it
[24:01] so is he the author of life to the
[24:05] church
[24:06] his working signifies his and tearing
[24:09] care of it
[24:10] he is the chief shepherd watching over
[24:13] his own
[24:14] that is his right
[24:17] for he bought that church with his own
[24:19] blood
[24:20] that blood is the blood of god the one
[24:23] who owns
[24:25] that church is good very good he is the
[24:28] first and the last
[24:30] that title spills eternity he was dead
[24:33] and is alive he paid the price so he has
[24:36] sold ownership of the temp of gold
[24:38] he rules it
[24:39] he's worshiping it
[24:41] he resents anyone taking over his
[24:43] lordship and authority no doubt the
[24:45] reason he introduces himself to each age
[24:47] as deity
[24:49] is to warn and confront the people he
[24:52] wants the false wife and he confronts
[24:55] the truth
[24:56] this is the one to almighty god
[25:00] live amen now three things or four
[25:02] things that i really wanted to look at
[25:04] and if there's anyone who also has a
[25:05] question or something you want to
[25:07] discuss from this you feel free
[25:09] now in the first part or the opening
[25:11] part there he says would i would um say
[25:15] i am the first and the last which was
[25:16] alive and his dead the first thing that
[25:18] happens to a man is that he is born
[25:21] and the last thing that happens to him
[25:23] is he does what
[25:25] he dies so he says this is not a man
[25:27] that is speaking yes because for him
[25:29] he's speaking reverse
[25:31] i was there
[25:33] and now
[25:35] i'm alive
[25:36] so meaning for him and before remember
[25:39] before he died he was alive
[25:41] he was alive he died and he's alive so
[25:44] in other words he is more than
[25:47] man this is deed speaking this is not
[25:49] the man
[25:51] you know like you and me but his god
[25:53] himself was dead and is alive he's
[25:56] speaking of jesus christ
[25:59] then he begins he brings another point
[26:01] here of the man jesus
[26:03] and the man adam
[26:06] he says that
[26:07] adam took a paradise and turned it into
[26:09] a wasting holding wilderness but this
[26:11] one is coming back to a time and earth
[26:14] rocking and reading with the destruction
[26:16] into another eden
[26:18] adam took a life of fellowship and joy
[26:19] with god and turned it into a desert of
[26:21] spiritual darkness that brought forth
[26:23] all sin moral decay pain suffering
[26:25] delusion and corruption that was within
[26:28] the souls of men until today but he says
[26:31] but this one
[26:32] from all the tragic death and
[26:34] degradation that filled mankind brought
[26:36] forth a life of righteousness and beauty
[26:38] so that has seen once reigned unto death
[26:40] even so my men now reign in
[26:42] righteousness by one that is
[26:45] christ jesus
[26:47] and not as the offense was
[26:50] look
[26:51] you need to understand one thing here
[26:53] that
[26:54] the bible calls jesus the second adam
[26:57] did you know that
[26:58] and it also calls jesus
[27:01] rather adam
[27:03] the one of genesis according to the
[27:04] first adam
[27:06] so in one one person one day ask me so
[27:09] you mean that jesus is your brother
[27:11] in one sense yes jesus is my brother
[27:14] jesus is our brother
[27:17] but also he is more than a brother
[27:20] he is our goal
[27:22] did you know we sing a song that is
[27:24] everything to me yes
[27:27] do you check if you see from that song
[27:29] there it's a very very good chorus just
[27:31] put everything perhaps you'll get it
[27:34] you know jesus is he's a doctor
[27:38] he's a friend he's a father
[27:42] he's a mother
[27:43] a brother
[27:44] he's a sister he's god he's a teacher
[27:50] is the husband your husband
[27:52] don't call him your wife that's the only
[27:54] thing he is not
[27:55] what else
[27:56] [Music]
[28:00] is he's a keeper he's a protector he's a

[30:18] jesus is everything to me and here we
[30:20] know that he is also our brother as a
[30:23] second adam he is our brother you know
[30:26] there was a law in the old testament and
[30:28] that was the law
[30:30] of um
[30:32] the kinsmen
[30:34] redeemer you know when when you lost
[30:37] your property
[30:39] your kinsman was the one supposed to
[30:41] redeem everything
[30:43] or when if you died also in this in the
[30:45] case like the case of uh
[30:47] of what was his name is it an admiration
[30:51] the husband of naomi
[30:53] you know
[30:54] his brother was the one supposed to
[30:56] redeem he's a kids man he's next of kin
[30:59] you know when you open up
[31:01] they ask who is the next of kin the next
[31:04] of kin is like your kinsman
[31:06] but
[31:07] what happened is
[31:09] that the king's man that was the
[31:11] kingsman of elementary refused when he
[31:14] heard about
[31:15] ruth
[31:16] but somehow
[31:18] there is another one who was in the next
[31:22] line the next of kin after him
[31:25] and that was born
[31:27] for him he accepted to redeem
[31:29] hallelujah
[31:31] now if you have not if you don't know
[31:33] what i'm talking about read the book of
[31:34] rules
[31:36] it will be a blessing
[31:38] now
[31:39] also there is another one
[31:44] to us who is our next of kin
[31:47] our next of kin is not your mother your
[31:49] father your brother your sister your
[31:51] friend your relatives our next of kin
[31:56] do you have the word king
[31:58] kin means blood relative
[32:02] he must be from with the same lineage
[32:04] like you
[32:06] he must be born
[32:08] in the same way you are born
[32:11] now who was our first one
[32:14] who were we at first we were adam
[32:17] but we sinned adam sinned
[32:20] and when he said
[32:22] he wasn't supposed no one else can
[32:24] redeem him
[32:26] but he's next of kin
[32:29] even an angel could not that's why we
[32:31] sing a song that even the angels cannot
[32:33] sing angels don't know any song about
[32:35] redemption
[32:36] because angels have never been redeemed
[32:38] angels have sinned before but angels
[32:39] cannot be redeemed when they sinned it
[32:42] was done for them
[32:44] but for us
[32:45] in adam when we sinned
[32:47] god decided because remember god adam
[32:50] was a spoken word of god and adam was a
[32:54] son of god because it was a spoken word
[32:55] of god so there was no one to die for
[32:57] adam or to do to be there for to die for
[33:00] him
[33:00] the only
[33:02] person that can be able to die for him
[33:04] is his blood brother
[33:06] but do you know who your blood brother
[33:08] is
[33:10] what does it mean billy paul when i say
[33:12] your blood breath
[33:17] what does it mean
[33:18] yes same
[33:20] parent
[33:21] you are you
[33:22] you are fathered by the same father
[33:25] so adam had
[33:27] to have
[33:29] his blood brother
[33:31] to be able to die
[33:33] for him
[33:36] are you following me yes but did the
[33:38] adam have a blood brother
[33:41] i'd have never had a blood brother right
[33:43] so what could god do because remember
[33:46] adam was a part of god
[33:48] and adam did not have a blood brother
[33:51] and yet god wanted to be a redeemer
[33:54] he wanted to to be called a redeemer he
[33:57] had that attribute within him and he
[33:59] wanted that attribute to be made
[34:01] manifest
[34:03] and in order for that to happen
[34:06] i will tell you what god did right here
[34:09] okay yo um but i'm going to ask you for
[34:12] scripture now
[34:13] in corinthians i believe it is
[34:17] hallelujah
[34:25] okay
[34:28] first corinthians chapter 15.
[34:34] versus a
[34:38] it's a it is it's all a good chapter
[34:41] but you can begin
[34:48] just read for the 4 45. just give me
[34:50] those ones
[34:56] there is a natural body and there is a
[34:58] spiritual body
[34:59] and so it is written the first man adam
[35:01] was made a living soul
[35:03] the last adam was made
[35:05] a quickening spirit
[35:11] have you got it brother
[35:14] chapter 15 yes
[35:16] yeah 45
[35:20] how bait that was not
[35:22] fast which is spiritual but that which
[35:23] is natural and afterward that which is
[35:26] spiritual
[35:28] the first man is of the earth
[35:30] i love verse 46 which says that uh
[35:34] fast
[35:36] that which is natural
[35:38] just like you were born as a natural
[35:40] being
[35:41] but then you must also be born
[35:43] spiritually
[35:44] first you were born physically like adam
[35:47] now you must be born spiritually
[35:50] you must be born of the spirit at first
[35:52] you were born carnally like in the flesh
[35:54] but now you must be born again
[35:56] but also adam was created first
[35:59] then
[36:01] that was the first man he was natural
[36:03] and then comes the spiritual man which
[36:05] was jesus the second adam are you
[36:08] following
[36:09] okay
[36:10] excuse me verse 47
[36:13] the first man is of the earth
[36:15] earthy
[36:16] the second man is the lord
[36:20] from
[36:21] that's a very good one for the people
[36:23] who doubt that jesus is god the first
[36:26] man was of the earth athe the second man
[36:30] is the lord
[36:32] from heaven
[36:34] not
[36:34] the second person
[36:36] of the trinity but the lord
[36:39] from
[36:40] heaven
[36:41] now there is your second adam the first
[36:44] adam was adam who sinned and then the
[36:46] second adam is jesus christ himself
[36:49] now here is my point jesus was a second
[36:54] second
[36:56] second adam
[36:57] you what is your name
[37:01] what is your full name
[37:04] what is your name
[37:07] that's your full name
[37:09] my friend yes
[37:11] all right what is your name brother
[37:15] say that again loudly
[37:18] all right somewhere
[37:26] the same thing right
[37:28] because you
[37:29] do you know what it means it means you
[37:31] are a son of a peru
[37:35] you also it means your son or you you
[37:37] come from the same root
[37:39] yes
[37:40] you know
[37:41] so
[37:42] to say that
[37:45] jesus is the second adam and the other
[37:47] was the first adam is to mean they all
[37:50] come from the same root
[37:53] they all come from the same origin
[37:56] they all share the same blood
[38:00] adam the first one was a manifestation
[38:05] of
[38:06] uh
[38:07] an attribute of god
[38:09] can i also say that jesus was also a
[38:12] manifestation of the attribute of god
[38:15] yes i can say that
[38:17] because jesus
[38:19] is at uh an attribute of god manifested
[38:23] because god
[38:24] in him he wanted to be a savior to be a
[38:27] savior he had to manifest his attribute
[38:29] as a son
[38:31] are you following me
[38:32] so we now see
[38:35] jesus
[38:37] being the second adam it means he was a
[38:39] brother of
[38:40] adam
[38:42] for him to be a brother of adam it
[38:44] remains according to the law
[38:46] of the kinsman redeemer the law
[38:49] of salvation
[38:52] it remains
[38:53] that
[38:54] the second man adam
[38:57] that is jesus
[38:58] now qualified to be able to save his
[39:02] brother adam hallelujah
[39:04] so which means jesus was not only a
[39:08] kinis man
[39:10] but he was a kinisman
[39:12] redeemer meaning he was qualifying
[39:15] to redeem
[39:17] he redeemed and he was qualifying just
[39:19] like that man went that boaz he went on
[39:23] a gate he removed his shoe he put it up
[39:25] he said to everybody you see
[39:28] let this be a testament or testimony
[39:30] today that i have decided to redeem all
[39:33] that which was eddie manages and also
[39:37] a take now on me here and i've bought
[39:39] her to be i mean not now me but ruth and
[39:42] i've bought her to be my wife
[39:46] jesus did the same thing
[39:48] amen when he went on the cross
[39:50] hallelujah he was lifted up and he said
[39:53] everybody see me that was a testament a
[39:56] testimony he was leaving behind i have
[39:58] decided today
[40:00] to redeem all that which was my brothers
[40:04] and also take
[40:07] karemua
[40:09] and also take
[40:11] part
[40:12] and also pray
[40:14] whoever you are another day
[40:17] son so to be my wife
[40:20] hallelujah that is how and why he
[40:22] becomes both our brother and wife and
[40:25] husband rather he becomes both our
[40:28] brother
[40:29] and our husband how come because he was
[40:33] wearing all the shoes
[40:35] at first for him oh hallelujah feel so
[40:37] nice for him in order to save us he had
[40:39] to take off the shoes of a father he had
[40:42] to take off the shoes of of god he took
[40:45] it off he said that oh in philippians he
[40:47] says for god
[40:48] amen let this mind be in you which was
[40:51] also in the philippians 2 which was also
[40:53] in christ jesus who being in the form of
[40:56] god thought it not robert to be equal
[40:58] with the god but he took upon himself
[41:00] the form of a man
[41:03] being found in a fashion as a man
[41:06] or as a servant he took upon himself the
[41:09] death even the death of the cross
[41:12] because he was found in a fashion as a
[41:15] servant as a man you understand he took
[41:17] off the shoes from him of being god the
[41:21] father so that he can be able to wear
[41:23] the shoes of our brother that's why he
[41:24] can be our brother and also he can be
[41:26] our god hallelujah
[41:29] so friends that's why here we now go
[41:32] back to our church edge book brother
[41:34] he says that
[41:36] this first man
[41:38] adam took a world which was so beautiful
[41:41] and he turned it in wasted it
[41:44] you know
[41:45] he brought
[41:47] what did he bring he mentions those
[41:49] things that are down there
[41:51] adam took a paradise and turned it into
[41:53] a west
[41:54] holding wilderness
[41:57] but this one is coming back to an earth
[42:01] rocking and reeling with destruction
[42:02] into another aiden
[42:05] friends we are going into another aiden
[42:09] hallelujah
[42:10] adam took a life of fellowship and joy
[42:12] with god and turned it into a desert of
[42:15] spiritual darkness
[42:16] that brought forth all sin
[42:19] moral decay
[42:22] pain
[42:23] suffering
[42:25] delusion
[42:26] delusion the delusions of the world the
[42:29] the the delusive dream of the world
[42:32] the devil took it
[42:34] rather the devil has turned this world
[42:36] into that by this
[42:38] fallen adam
[42:39] by this fallen adam
[42:41] it is people who are creating the world
[42:43] i mean making the world be
[42:45] the way it is now they're talking of
[42:47] global warming they're talking of many
[42:49] things that are going wrong earthquakes
[42:50] and stuff like that
[42:52] guns it is caused by what
[42:54] by man
[42:56] um so
[42:59] corruption

[43:03] coming
[43:04] and for him he is going to turn it
[43:06] righteous he's going to turn everything
[43:08] into the right way
[43:10] hallelujah that's the one we are waiting
[43:12] for
[43:14] hallelujah
[43:17] okay
[43:18] go down there
[43:19] at the beat he says and here he is
[43:21] working in the midst of those whom he
[43:23] has redeemed even his church and what
[43:26] where are those who were redeemed
[43:28] we are not many like paul mothers and
[43:30] corrupters where we also don't like
[43:32] those things
[43:34] yes we are not many like the dying thief
[43:36] robbers and men killers
[43:39] all trophies of his grace and all
[43:41] brought back from the dead all made
[43:43] alive in christ jesus the lord
[43:45] hallelujah
[43:46] i wonder if you're not at the salutation
[43:48] of the first age and they're not not the
[43:50] one to this age

[43:55] he said
[44:03] okay
[44:04] these things he says
[44:06] the first and the last which was and is
[44:09] and
[44:09] which was dead and is alive this one
[44:12] and the same person this one
[44:14] this sorry this is one and the same
[44:16] person
[44:17] and uh he is letting us know
[44:20] that the church is
[44:24] that the church is his and then one last
[44:25] thing here in the last paragraph which
[44:27] he says he is the chief shepherd
[44:29] watching over his own
[44:31] that is his right it is the right of
[44:33] jesus to watch over you
[44:36] don't ever at any time
[44:39] refuse his lordship over you
[44:43] it is the right it is his right to watch
[44:45] over you
[44:48] huh you people you are not getting it it
[44:52] is
[44:52] right it is jesus's right to watch over
[44:55] you
[44:55] it is his right to tell you stop that
[44:58] it is his right to do that it is right
[45:01] it is his right meaning he must do it if
[45:05] you are his
[45:06] own
[45:08] if you matter your wife it is
[45:10] your right
[45:12] to tell her what you want
[45:14] it is your right to rule over her
[45:16] it is you all right you got a point
[45:18] if i come and try to tell you what to
[45:20] what
[45:22] if i come and i try to tell your wife
[45:24] what to do
[45:25] even if i'm your pastor you will dismiss
[45:27] me immediately
[45:30] why because it is you are right
[45:32] amen to subdue her it is your right to
[45:35] rule over it is your right to tell her
[45:38] what to do it is your right as a husband
[45:41] therefore if the church is the church of
[45:43] jesus christ if you are a member of that
[45:46] church it is jesus's right
[45:48] to lead your life
[45:50] therefore you don't have any rights
[45:54] you do not have any rights all the
[45:56] rights are easy patent right it is a he
[46:01] is a copy he has a copyright on those
[46:03] rights
[46:04] no man even if they are pastors bishops
[46:08] parents friends they have no right to
[46:12] tell you to disobey christ yes
[46:15] it is his singular right
[46:18] to watch
[46:20] over he has a right over that church
[46:22] for he has bought that church with his
[46:24] own blood
[46:26] hallelujah
[46:28] if you go to a market huh yes sister is
[46:32] that pain in yours
[46:33] are you sure that pain is yours
[46:35] why are you saying it is yours
[46:38] you bought it
[46:39] now
[46:40] what if someone comes and claims
[46:42] ownership over that pain
[46:47] you let them have a habit
[46:52] if you have another option but now you
[46:54] have another option so what would you do
[47:00] you tell them you are using it if they
[47:02] say ah give me what you do
[47:06] why would you do that
[47:09] because it is your yes
[47:11] you got a point yes it is you are right
[47:15] sometimes when i'm at the airport i meet
[47:18] people and uh
[47:20] you know sometimes
[47:22] when we pause for a long time you can
[47:23] always pause it so
[47:26] when uh you just click pause you know so
[47:29] sometimes
[47:31] when i'm at the airport and i meet
[47:32] people
[47:34] uh
[47:35] you know having pains and maybe i lost
[47:37] my pen or i did not i forgot to carry
[47:39] one and they're filling up certain
[47:41] things in the on the form at the airport
[47:43] i usually want to reach out and tell
[47:45] them please can you help me with your
[47:47] pen if someone is rude and they say no
[47:50] thank you there is nothing you can do
[47:54] whether or not you think they are not
[47:56] needing it and you need it there is
[47:58] nothing you can do
[47:59] they have
[48:01] rights over that pain because it is
[48:03] theirs
[48:04] in the same way
[48:05] but the panamera says that jesus bought
[48:07] the church with his own blood
[48:10] there is no pastor who has brought the
[48:11] church with his blood there is no pastor
[48:13] was bowed to you with his blood there is
[48:15] no church which has bowed you with his
[48:17] blood there is no man or woman who has
[48:18] bored you with his blood it is the blood
[48:21] of god himself is the blood of jesus
[48:23] christ himself
[48:25] and therefore what does it mean it means
[48:28] he has a right of ownership to you amen
[48:31] and he has a right over you than anyone
[48:33] else in the world
[48:34] even if it is somebody who has a right
[48:37] over you here in the world
[48:39] when it comes to jesus he supersedes all
[48:42] of them
[48:43] you see he was dead and he's alive and
[48:45] he paid the price for so he has soul
[48:47] ownership of the temple of god
[48:50] can you imagine you don't own yourself
[48:51] and also no no one nobody owns you you
[48:54] don't own yourself and also nobody owns
[48:56] you it is a christ who owns you
[49:00] did you ever think of that
[49:03] did you ever think of that that you're
[49:04] so important that like that
[49:07] did you ever think of that
[49:12] that
[49:12] you are a property
[49:18] a property of somebody
[49:20] and that somebody is not a human being
[49:22] that's somebody's good yes
[49:24] hey
[49:25] how should you live now
[49:27] how should you walk in this world how
[49:30] should you behave the moment you know
[49:33] you are not only
[49:35] loved by god but you are owned by him
[49:39] that comes with responsibility
[49:42] if some if you say if i said that is my
[49:44] car
[49:45] it comes with the responsibility
[49:47] you understand i must fuel it i must
[49:50] wash it i must
[49:52] service it i must do everything that i
[49:55] ought to do why
[49:57] because it is my cat therefore it comes
[49:59] with
[50:01] responsibility
[50:03] if god says he owns you
[50:06] it means he's responsible for you yes
[50:08] why then should you worry about anything
[50:10] in this life hallelujah
[50:13] that means that he owns you he is
[50:17] you people that's so happy right now it
[50:20] remains your aiming is fully responsible
[50:24] for your life fully
[50:28] i said
[50:29] fully
[50:31] he is responsible for your life fully
[50:32] therefore do not fear what the devil can
[50:35] do or whatever plans you know there were
[50:37] plans for each of us every day but no
[50:39] matter what the devil plans i know god
[50:41] is responsible for my life
[50:43] hallelujah
[50:45] because he owns me i do not own him he
[50:48] owns me hallelujah
[50:51] he desense anyone taking over his
[50:53] lordship and authority he doesn't like
[50:54] it
[50:57] no doubt the reason he introduces
[50:59] himself to each agent's deity is to warn
[51:01] and comfort the people
[51:03] he wants the first vine
[51:05] he comforts the true vine
[51:07] this is the one true
[51:10] almighty god
[51:12] hallelujah amen
[51:15] you are god
[51:17] from beginning
[51:19] to the end

[51:25] you are good all by yourself
[51:31] oh you are god
[51:34] from beginning to the end there's no
[51:39] cause for argument

[51:52] from beginning
[51:54] to the end
[51:56] there's no
[51:58] cause for argument

[52:08] hallelujah
[52:09] he is all god
[52:11] he is god by himself he doesn't need
[52:13] anyone to help him be god
[52:16] he doesn't need anyone to help him rule
[52:18] therefore he is the ruler of the church
[52:20] he's the controller of the church
[52:22] hallelujah

[52:56] minor something he was good everything
[53:00] that makes up god
[53:02] all right give us the next
[53:09] okay
[53:12] verse nine
[53:14] the conditions to the edge
[53:17] so i need someone else to read
[53:23] who is going to read
[53:25] but you're a bit faster you'll need to
[53:26] come a bit closer here so that people
[53:28] can be able to hear
[53:30] maybe get us
[53:32] get another chair you just sit a little
[53:35] bit closer
[53:44] conditions of the age
[53:46] relation chapter 2 verse 9
[53:49] any time of sunday tribulation and
[53:52] poverty
[53:53] but thou art
[53:55] and i know the blasphemy of them which
[53:57] say they are jews
[53:59] and are not but are the synagogues
[54:02] of saturn
[54:03] the key in this age is most evidently
[54:06] tribulation
[54:08] if there stipulation in the first age
[54:10] there is now predicted an intensified
[54:13] tribulation throughout the second age
[54:16] there is no doubt about what
[54:18] the following words of course apply to
[54:20] the muscle cushions
[54:23] [Music]
[54:26] hebrews chapter 10 verse 32 to 38
[54:29] but court remembers the former days in
[54:32] which after he was eliminated
[54:35] he endured a great fight of afflictions
[54:39] partly wheels tier or made a gazing stop
[54:43] both by reproaches and afflictions
[54:51] yeah and partly with tmb became
[54:55] companion
[54:59] companions of them that were so used
[55:02] we had compassion
[55:05] of me in my bones and took the fully the
[55:08] spoiling of your
[55:09] goods
[55:10] knowing in yourself that he have a
[55:13] heaven a better
[55:15] and unenduring
[55:18] substance that's not a way there are for
[55:20] your confidence which are great
[55:23] recoveries everywhere
[55:25] for you have need of patience that after
[55:29] you have done the will of god you might
[55:32] receive the promise create a little
[55:35] while and he that shall come will come
[55:38] and you know
[55:40] now
[55:41] they just shall live by faith
[55:43] but if any man grow back
[55:46] my my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[55:49] the mere association of king kind
[55:51] hearted people with a true believer my
[55:54] dream bring death in return for their
[55:57] kindness
[55:59] now the lord god almighty says i know
[56:02] there he is walking in the middle of his
[56:04] report
[56:05] there he is the chief shepherd of the
[56:07] floor
[56:09] but does he hold back the persecution
[56:12] does he stem the tribulation
[56:14] no he does not he simply says i know
[56:17] your tribulation
[56:18] i am not at all
[56:21] unmindful of your suffering
[56:24] what a stumbling block this is to me
[56:28] what is something below this is to so
[56:31] many people
[56:32] like israel they wonder if god really
[56:35] loves them
[56:37] how can god be just unloving if he
[56:40] stands by and watches these people
[56:42] suffer that is what they asked in
[56:45] malachi chapter 1 verse 3 verse 1-3
[56:50] the burden of the word of the lord of
[56:52] israel by malachi i have loved you saith
[56:56] the lord
[57:07] [Music]
[57:11] waste for the dragons and the regulars
[57:14] you see
[57:15] they could not figure out god's love
[57:18] they thought that love meant no
[57:19] suffering he thought that love made a
[57:22] baby
[57:23] with parental care but would said that
[57:26] islam was elected now
[57:28] the proof the proof of his love is
[57:30] election
[57:31] that no matter that no matter what
[57:33] happened his love was proven truly by
[57:36] the fact that
[57:37] by the fact they were chosen and to
[57:40] salvation
[57:42] because god has chosen you
[57:44] to salvation
[57:47] through sanctification of the spirit and
[57:49] belief of the truth
[57:51] he may commit you to date as he did paul
[57:55] may commit you to suffering as he did
[57:58] yoga
[58:00] that is his pre pre
[58:02] period prerogative
[58:05] he is suffering
[58:07] but it is born with a purpose
[58:09] if he did not have a purpose then he
[58:12] would be the author of frustration or
[58:13] not of peace
[58:16] his purpose is that after we have
[58:18] suffered a while he will be made perfect
[58:21] be established strengthened and settled
[58:24] as you've said he put strength in us
[58:28] chapter 23 verse 6
[58:32] you see
[58:34] you see
[58:35] himself suffered
[58:37] he learned obedience by the things that
[58:38] he suffered he was actually made perfect
[58:41] by the things that he suffered
[58:43] hebrews chapter five verse eight to nine
[58:47] though he was a son
[58:49] yet learned he obedies by a thing which
[58:51] he suffered and being made perfect he
[58:54] became the author of eternal salvation
[58:57] and to all them that obey him
[58:59] in plain language the very character of
[59:02] jesus was corrected by suffering and
[59:05] according to paul she was made
[59:07] he has left his church a measure of
[59:10] suffering that day
[59:12] to by their faith in god while suffering
[59:15] for him would come to a place of
[59:18] perfection why did he want this
[59:21] james chapter one verse two to four my
[59:25] brethren
[59:26] count it on joy when you fall into
[59:28] diverse temptations knowing this that
[59:30] the trying of your faith working
[59:33] patience but let pushes have had perfect
[59:36] work
[59:37] that he may interpret an entire point in
[59:40] happiness
[59:42] and by the reason is in
[59:44] romans 8 verse 17-18
[59:47] and his children
[59:49] then he has heard of god and joint
[59:52] prayers with christ if so be that we
[59:54] suffer with him that we will be also
[59:57] glorified together for i recall that the
[1:00:00] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:00:03] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:00:05] which shall be revealed in us
[1:00:08] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:00:10] train with him we have to suffer to
[1:00:12] reign
[1:00:14] the reason for this is that character
[1:00:16] simply is never made without suffering
[1:00:19] character is a victory not a gift
[1:00:22] a man without character can train
[1:00:24] because power apart from character is
[1:00:26] satanic
[1:00:30] and since he wants us to share even his
[1:00:32] throne on the
[1:00:34] on the same basis that he overcame and
[1:00:37] he sat down in his father's throne then
[1:00:40] we have to overcome to sit with him
[1:00:43] and the little temporary suffering will
[1:00:45] go through now is not what he should be
[1:00:48] compared to the tremendous glory that
[1:00:50] will be revealed in us when he comes
[1:00:54] oh what treasures are laid up for those
[1:00:57] who are willing to enter into his
[1:00:59] kingdom through much tribulation
[1:01:02] make it not strange concerning a theory
[1:01:04] triangles that
[1:01:06] to try
[1:01:07] that is what peter said is each strength
[1:01:10] that god wants us to develop with
[1:01:13] christ like character that comes through
[1:01:15] suffering
[1:01:17] no sir
[1:01:19] and we
[1:01:20] all have trials we are all tried and
[1:01:22] justin as sons
[1:01:24] not one but
[1:01:28] not one but goes through uh through that
[1:01:33] the child that is not suffering and is
[1:01:35] not being trained
[1:01:42] [Music]
[1:01:50] six and
[1:02:04] estimate
[1:02:06] [Music]
[1:02:10] now the special conditioning standards
[1:02:12] must be applied to every age there is no
[1:02:15] edge for me there is no true delivery
[1:02:22] [Music]
[1:02:47] you and persecute you and shall say all
[1:02:50] manner of evil against you falsely for
[1:02:52] my sake rejoice and be exceedingly glad
[1:02:56] for what is your own one
[1:02:57] name
[1:02:59] for so persecuted by the
[1:03:17] [Music]
[1:03:43] us of history
[1:03:44] facing us as sons and how shall i prove
[1:03:47] my love to him
[1:03:49] by believing what he said and by
[1:03:51] connecting myself with joy amidst the
[1:03:54] trials that he
[1:03:55] actually
[1:04:11] is looking down
[1:04:13] upon his family he is the head of his
[1:04:16] household he is the provider he is the
[1:04:18] protector yet he looks
[1:04:21] at their poverty or how
[1:04:24] how
[1:04:31] [Music]
[1:04:36] meaning the believer
[1:04:37] is so-called believer but when he's not
[1:04:39] told
[1:04:40] he stumbles at this
[1:04:43] how can god bear to look upon his own in
[1:04:46] a time of nature not
[1:04:48] just so before just giving and nourish
[1:04:51] everything material upon them here is
[1:04:54] where you have to believe again
[1:04:57] in the love and goodness and wisdom of
[1:04:59] god
[1:05:00] these two is needful remember
[1:05:03] we admonished
[1:05:05] take nothing for the moral
[1:05:20] these physical things are not the true
[1:05:22] basic necessities of life
[1:05:25] for a man's life
[1:05:27] consistent with the things he possesses
[1:05:30] but rather seek here trust the kingdom
[1:05:32] of god and his righteousness and all
[1:05:34] material necessities will be added
[1:05:37] the people of god are not machiavellian
[1:05:40] they are just they are christ-minded
[1:05:43] they do not seek the treasures that are
[1:05:46] below they seek those above
[1:05:48] which is absolutely
[1:05:50] true
[1:05:51] the majority of christians are not
[1:05:53] working rather they are on the poor side
[1:05:57] because so in jesus day
[1:06:00] it was too imposed
[1:06:02] and it should
[1:06:15] an abundance of earthly goods
[1:06:20] my how richly churches and goods that
[1:06:22] have worked in spirit
[1:06:24] they said be a poor
[1:06:26] for yours is the kingdom of god the
[1:06:29] kingdom of god is not meat and drink it
[1:06:31] is not what you
[1:06:33] which is
[1:06:35] within us eventually
[1:06:43] a rich man is rich in god not in worldly
[1:06:46] things hallelujah brother you have two
[1:06:49] more paragraphs
[1:06:52] don't put down the fire
[1:06:54] oh christ the spirit i see
[1:06:57] poverty
[1:06:58] i see your needs you have it very much
[1:07:02] if anything to do so
[1:07:05] what you did you have
[1:07:07] what you didn't have has been taken from
[1:07:09] me
[1:07:10] you gladly gave us
[1:07:19] [Music]
[1:07:27] and exceeding
[1:07:28] great rewards your kingdom is yet to
[1:07:31] come but it will come and it will be an
[1:07:34] everlasting one yes i am mindful of your
[1:07:37] trials and wars i know how hard it is to
[1:07:41] get along
[1:07:42] but i will remember all this
[1:07:46] when i began to play with my own
[1:07:49] and then i will reward you
[1:07:52] now this is nothing because rich people
[1:07:57] now this is nothing against rich people
[1:07:59] because god can save a rich man you
[1:08:02] believe that
[1:08:05] some of both children are rich but money
[1:08:07] can be such a snail
[1:08:16] we are not trying to preach a gospel of
[1:08:18] being poor
[1:08:19] but yes money can be
[1:08:21] as name not to the only ones that have
[1:08:24] it but even to those who don't have it
[1:08:27] hey someone can be without money and
[1:08:29] they feel so uncomfortable that they
[1:08:31] live good
[1:08:32] and others can have so much
[1:08:34] that they feel so big and they leave god
[1:08:37] so
[1:08:38] it all calls for somebody that really
[1:08:41] loves the lord and knowing whether i
[1:08:42] have the money or i do not have the
[1:08:44] money whether i have the needs that i
[1:08:46] want or i do not have the needs
[1:08:49] praise be to the name of the lord
[1:08:51] you say in this verse here verse nine
[1:08:54] it teaches us that uh the these people
[1:08:57] suffered
[1:08:58] and yes they suffered
[1:09:00] but like they suffered we also are going
[1:09:04] to suffer amen
[1:09:06] every believer must come to this every
[1:09:09] child of god must come to this
[1:09:11] every one of us must suffer
[1:09:14] there is a portion of suffering that was
[1:09:16] left for the children of god
[1:09:19] you may say how come yes it is so
[1:09:22] because jesus
[1:09:23] you remember when he was going to the
[1:09:25] cross carrying the cross did he carry it
[1:09:27] alone
[1:09:29] there was a another man who went up to
[1:09:31] him
[1:09:32] which was indicative to the fact that
[1:09:34] even us the ones he is dying for we have
[1:09:38] to carry
[1:09:39] a bit of our cross with him
[1:09:42] we have to cut it the cross for him
[1:09:46] because of him we have a cross also to
[1:09:49] carry just like a current we also have a
[1:09:51] cross to come
[1:09:53] sometimes we may go through a period of
[1:09:55] suffering you know we don't all go
[1:09:57] through the same situations in life
[1:09:59] some may lack what to eat others may
[1:10:02] lack
[1:10:05] school fees
[1:10:07] others may lack friends
[1:10:10] i don't believe that as a child of god
[1:10:12] you should even lack friends by the way
[1:10:14] because there are many christians
[1:10:17] in the world
[1:10:18] and all those are your friends
[1:10:20] but some may not have parents some may
[1:10:22] be orphans
[1:10:23] others you know may lack many things you
[1:10:25] know in life
[1:10:26] but we know one thing that we all might
[1:10:28] go through different sufferings but we
[1:10:31] all go through the blood
[1:10:32] you know that song yes brother if you
[1:10:35] can find it for me
[1:10:37] we all have gone through certain things
[1:10:39] in life
[1:10:40] you know situation some may even suffer
[1:10:44] because of the name of jesus to be
[1:10:46] your friends can reject you and talk bad
[1:10:49] about you if you stand for christ
[1:10:52] let me tell you if this world doesn't
[1:10:55] reject you for christ it means that the
[1:10:58] world has accepted you for them
[1:11:01] you either get rejected by the world for
[1:11:04] christ
[1:11:05] and loved by god
[1:11:08] or you get loved by the world and you
[1:11:10] you'll be rejected by god
[1:11:12] you cannot have both
[1:11:14] you cannot have both
[1:11:16] and we all go
[1:11:17] each of us go through
[1:11:19] a certain degree of suffering never at
[1:11:22] any time say oh look at that one i wish
[1:11:24] i was like that one oh look at that one
[1:11:27] at least for him is like this
[1:11:29] whichever situation you are in
[1:11:32] someone else is in a
[1:11:34] one which they think is bitter than
[1:11:36] yours
[1:11:40] every christian has
[1:11:42] something they go through
[1:11:44] that becomes
[1:11:47] a problem to them
[1:11:49] that
[1:11:50] and they go through it not because
[1:11:52] they are human beings but they go
[1:11:54] through it because they are christians
[1:11:55] please
[1:11:56] don't
[1:11:57] and misunderstand this
[1:12:00] of course you every human being has the
[1:12:02] way they leave blah blah blah but many
[1:12:04] many
[1:12:06] of the things they go through in the
[1:12:08] wild is because of their choices
[1:12:10] but
[1:12:11] what i'm saying here is that the things
[1:12:13] that you suffer
[1:12:15] because of your choice to be a christian
[1:12:18] that
[1:12:19] you you you can pray but certain times
[1:12:22] certain times it might seem as if god is
[1:12:24] blocking his ears
[1:12:26] that your prayers are not being heard by
[1:12:28] god
[1:12:30] but if you're a christian you receive
[1:12:32] another attitude
[1:12:35] of believing all is well if this
[1:12:38] mountain is not moving
[1:12:40] one thing that i know that my god can
[1:12:42] move the mountain
[1:12:44] but whether or not he moves it i will
[1:12:46] still worship him
[1:12:48] whether or not the mountain moves i will
[1:12:50] still praise him
[1:12:51] hallelujah because i believe in my god i
[1:12:54] trust in my god hallelujah
[1:12:58] what's the song saying
[1:13:00] it says
[1:13:01] some through
[1:13:03] [Music]
[1:13:10] [Music]
[1:13:22] is
[1:13:23] [Music]
[1:13:35] [Music]
[1:13:45] but all through
[1:13:47] the blind
[1:13:49] sign through
[1:13:51] great sorrow
[1:13:54] but god gave the song
[1:14:13] green pastures so rich and so sweet
[1:14:19] god this is the children
[1:14:23] alone
[1:14:34] [Music]
[1:14:40] oh
[1:14:53] through the fire
[1:15:05] god
[1:15:08] [Applause]
[1:15:11] [Music]
[1:15:22] i
[1:15:34] oh
[1:15:37] [Music]
[1:15:50] oh
[1:16:14] god
[1:16:28] in the night season
[1:16:32] and all the day long
[1:16:38] and when the problems come
[1:16:42] when the problems come
[1:16:44] you pray you pray it doesn't go away you
[1:16:48] should just worship him
[1:16:50] you know you should sing a song which
[1:16:51] says
[1:16:52] let everything within me
[1:16:55] cry
[1:16:57] jesus
[1:16:59] because you believe it without your
[1:17:00] heart and say let
[1:17:02] everything within me
[1:17:05] cry
[1:17:07] jesus
[1:17:10] [Music]
[1:17:12] jesus
[1:17:13] [Music]
[1:17:19] jesus jesus
[1:17:21] jesus
[1:17:23] is the lamb
[1:17:26] that was
[1:17:31] you know you worship him because not
[1:17:34] because everything is okay
[1:17:36] you worship him because you believe in
[1:17:39] him
[1:17:40] and you know that he wants the best for
[1:17:42] you
[1:17:43] he'll give you the best
[1:17:45] and because you know
[1:17:47] that there is nothing you can ask him
[1:17:49] and he cannot give it to you meaning
[1:17:51] there is nothing you can ask him and
[1:17:52] he's not able to give it to you but
[1:17:54] certain times you can ask for some
[1:17:56] things and he may not give it to you he
[1:17:58] doesn't mean he has failed
[1:18:00] do you understand
[1:18:02] let us take this from verse 9 and from
[1:18:04] this portion of the smile and church
[1:18:07] to believe that believer
[1:18:11] whatever you ask god
[1:18:13] he is able to do
[1:18:15] [Music]
[1:18:17] whatever you ask god is able to do what
[1:18:20] but it doesn't mean that whatever you
[1:18:23] ask him he will do it
[1:18:26] but even when he doesn't do it you still
[1:18:28] believe he is able to do it
[1:18:31] hallelujah
[1:18:33] and
[1:18:34] that does not mean you are immune to
[1:18:36] suffering actually it only means that
[1:18:38] you may suffer because you are his
[1:18:40] property he can commit you to suffering
[1:18:42] but he doesn't do it without a purpose
[1:18:44] [Music]
[1:18:48] hallelujah
[1:18:49] do you believe that
[1:18:51] say i
[1:18:52] believe he doesn't commit you to
[1:18:55] suffering without
[1:18:59] if i believe i'm a son of god brother oh
[1:19:02] and i suffer
[1:19:04] i believe i'm suffering for a
[1:19:07] as long as i know like job the only
[1:19:10] thing job needed to do was to check his
[1:19:11] life
[1:19:12] is my life right with god
[1:19:14] we know when a problem comes to you
[1:19:15] that's the first thing you should do
[1:19:16] always check your life
[1:19:18] is my life right with god
[1:19:21] is there any sacred sin is that
[1:19:22] something is there whatever i've done or
[1:19:24] photo
[1:19:25] you cleanse yourself you say oh god i
[1:19:26] mentioned me forgive me even if sickness
[1:19:28] comes to you you know you must not get
[1:19:30] sick
[1:19:33] as a child of god
[1:19:36] yes
[1:19:38] so when it comes you go in prayer many
[1:19:41] times my wife gives a testimony when flu
[1:19:43] wanted to come to her or something
[1:19:45] wanted to come to her
[1:19:46] you know
[1:19:48] she rebukes it immediately before it
[1:19:49] comes
[1:19:51] and it goes
[1:19:54] that's right
[1:19:55] if you believe a son of god even if
[1:19:58] sickness comes you have authority over
[1:20:00] it yes
[1:20:01] do you understand you must not be sick
[1:20:07] i said you must not be sick
[1:20:10] you must not suffer
[1:20:13] are you hearing me
[1:20:14] as a son of god you're supposed to live
[1:20:17] a life
[1:20:18] of victory
[1:20:22] you must overcome your problems
[1:20:24] you must have overcome your fears
[1:20:26] [Music]
[1:20:27] are you following me
[1:20:29] now that does it doesn't mean you cannot
[1:20:32] you should you will never suffer in your
[1:20:33] life
[1:20:35] when problems come when a sickness come
[1:20:38] when troubles come when suffering comes
[1:20:41] it's like you work and then whatever you
[1:20:44] worked for is lost
[1:20:46] you put in this pocket it goes through
[1:20:48] the other pocket you need to put in this
[1:20:50] hand to go through the other hand you
[1:20:51] don't you are not ever blessed
[1:20:55] all the blessing that comes it goes
[1:20:57] you should stop a moment
[1:20:59] and go before the lord and say what is
[1:21:01] wrong
[1:21:02] search is mine search your life
[1:21:05] and then maybe you may you realize you
[1:21:07] were even a robber
[1:21:09] you were never paying your tithe
[1:21:11] because if you don't pay your tithe you
[1:21:13] cannot see the blessing of god in your
[1:21:14] life
[1:21:16] you see then when you realize that's the
[1:21:17] problem even if you pray
[1:21:20] and you don't
[1:21:21] resolve it you can never prosper
[1:21:24] therefore you have to sort that out once
[1:21:27] you sort out probably money will come
[1:21:31] and even if it comes it doesn't mean now
[1:21:32] because you saw that you're tight and
[1:21:34] everything you will not get issues still
[1:21:35] you'll get issues but when you do check
[1:21:37] yourself again
[1:21:39] are you right with god
[1:21:41] when you realize i am right with god now
[1:21:43] why did i suffer this loss
[1:21:45] i don't know
[1:21:46] but i've been right with god even this
[1:21:48] check don't immediately say i'm okay i'm
[1:21:51] right with god check yourself
[1:21:53] if maybe you you realize you are right
[1:21:55] with god and you don't see anything
[1:21:56] wrong but if you you know maybe you
[1:21:58] can't go to the pastor asking pastor you
[1:22:00] know i've been going through certain
[1:22:01] issues i don't know what is wrong with
[1:22:03] me is there something maybe the pastor
[1:22:05] the holy spirit may help him to help you
[1:22:08] realize what is going wrong in your life
[1:22:11] and then sometimes there is nothing
[1:22:12] wrong you have done
[1:22:14] if there is nothing wrong you've done
[1:22:15] and then pray and even the pastor prayed
[1:22:17] for you you will pray also for the
[1:22:18] problem to go away that's true you
[1:22:21] believe
[1:22:22] that god can
[1:22:23] is able to take out that problem
[1:22:25] always be a believer let me tell you
[1:22:27] always be a believer no matter how big
[1:22:29] the problem is
[1:22:30] always believe god can take it away
[1:22:34] whatever it is i don't care what it is
[1:22:37] always believe god can what
[1:22:39] because he has the ability
[1:22:42] when you pray
[1:22:43] believe you have received
[1:22:45] hallelujah
[1:22:47] but if you are prayed and you believe
[1:22:49] you have received and the problem
[1:22:50] remains
[1:22:51] keep believing the problem has gone
[1:22:53] hallelujah
[1:22:55] even when you see it
[1:22:57] even when the symptoms are still there
[1:22:59] keep believing
[1:23:01] the problem has gone that's the attitude
[1:23:03] of a child of god
[1:23:05] in a problem
[1:23:07] hallelujah
[1:23:08] you are hospitalized because you are
[1:23:10] sick
[1:23:12] what do you do as the child of god you
[1:23:13] check your life
[1:23:15] are you right with god yes
[1:23:17] then what is wrong
[1:23:19] you don't know
[1:23:20] then quote for the elders of the church
[1:23:22] let them come anoint you with oil and
[1:23:24] pray for you
[1:23:26] you must be healed okay
[1:23:28] you believe you must what
[1:23:30] be healed now what if you are not healed
[1:23:32] someone may say no problem there is
[1:23:35] nothing like what if as long as you
[1:23:37] apply the word you must believe
[1:23:39] that's right hallelujah but sometimes
[1:23:41] you can pray and the problem
[1:23:44] the symptoms don't go actually you're
[1:23:45] already healed because
[1:23:46] that's when god says do this and then
[1:23:49] this will happen god is not a liar
[1:23:52] is he alive
[1:23:54] there are for what he said must happen
[1:23:56] and indeed it will happen but sometimes
[1:23:58] the same terms may remain
[1:24:02] many people have died of covet 19
[1:24:05] but not because of copy 19
[1:24:07] but because of the symptoms of covet 19.
[1:24:10] you know when covered 19 comes in your
[1:24:12] body like me i got covered 19.
[1:24:14] but when you get covered 19 there is two
[1:24:17] things cover 19 and the symptoms of it
[1:24:20] the demon itself and the damage it
[1:24:22] causes in your body
[1:24:24] now the demon comes and it continues
[1:24:27] reproducing in your lungs
[1:24:29] and it blocks you and you're not able to
[1:24:31] breathe anymore
[1:24:32] but sometimes when that demon is is
[1:24:34] inside you and is on the throat you can
[1:24:36] even
[1:24:37] cough it out or you can drink something
[1:24:39] hot it dies or you cannot you know or
[1:24:42] you can simply pray and it dies you
[1:24:44] understand yes and then you are healed
[1:24:45] before it even goes to the lungs like it
[1:24:48] was with my case
[1:24:49] when i prayed when they prayed for me
[1:24:51] and when i prayed the demon was in me in
[1:24:54] the throat i did not know but god took
[1:24:57] it out
[1:24:58] but it had caused the damage also on my
[1:25:01] body and everything those symptoms were
[1:25:03] there but i continue to believe that i
[1:25:05] am healed
[1:25:06] i continued preaching i continued
[1:25:08] baptizing and god made sure because the
[1:25:10] demon had left no one was contacted by
[1:25:11] copper 19.
[1:25:14] are you hearing me
[1:25:16] and then
[1:25:17] the symptoms may remain there and some
[1:25:19] people die from those symptoms
[1:25:22] you see
[1:25:23] some people do it they die from the
[1:25:25] symptoms so many times i believe as a
[1:25:27] believer when you pray you believe god
[1:25:28] has done something and then you still
[1:25:30] see the symptoms you're like it has not
[1:25:32] yet happened
[1:25:33] ah
[1:25:34] believe it has happened
[1:25:37] if you prayed for healing believe
[1:25:39] healing has come
[1:25:40] if someone has prayed for you for you
[1:25:42] believe if you pray because you're poor
[1:25:44] and they pray for you believe you are
[1:25:45] rich
[1:25:46] you understand and begin working towards
[1:25:48] that begin
[1:25:49] planning talking behaving
[1:25:52] conducting yourself with the attitude of
[1:25:55] a rich man because you believe you are
[1:25:57] rich even when you do not have anything
[1:25:59] hallelujah but when you are there every
[1:26:01] time begging begging
[1:26:04] talking like someone who is defeated
[1:26:08] talking like someone who
[1:26:09] who needs it you will always remain in
[1:26:12] the in the things you confess
[1:26:15] whatever you confess you shall be
[1:26:17] if you confess you are you are defeated
[1:26:19] if you confess you are a failure if you
[1:26:21] confess that
[1:26:23] you are any problems how are you dear
[1:26:25] brother oh for us brother we have a lot
[1:26:26] of problems you will always be like that
[1:26:31] let us take something out of verse 9 of
[1:26:33] chapter 2 of revelation
[1:26:37] god looks at you sometimes and says i
[1:26:39] know what you are going through i know
[1:26:40] you have prayed for riches i know you
[1:26:42] are praying not even for riches as such
[1:26:44] but you are prayed to be well to have
[1:26:46] the needs for your needs to be provided
[1:26:48] you are praying for this to happen you
[1:26:49] are praying for this problem to go away
[1:26:51] i know you are praying i know i have
[1:26:52] already granted it to you but here is
[1:26:55] the deal i want you to still remain with
[1:26:58] those symptoms so that it can come to a
[1:27:00] point where my character is already
[1:27:02] built out from you so that i can be able
[1:27:05] to use you to do the greater things you
[1:27:07] understand so sometimes god can say like
[1:27:09] that
[1:27:12] the problem can remain
[1:27:14] the symptoms of it i mean the problem
[1:27:15] will always go out of course when you
[1:27:16] pray
[1:27:17] but now the issue is we'll go check out
[1:27:19] the symptoms
[1:27:20] brother son
[1:27:21] stand up we'll go take out the symptoms
[1:27:24] the symptoms god may take it away or god
[1:27:26] may not
[1:27:27] whether all of the symptoms go away
[1:27:30] you must believe that it has gone
[1:27:32] a believer doesn't look at the symptoms
[1:27:34] the believer looks at watch
[1:27:37] god bless you
[1:27:38] the believer looks at the promise
[1:27:41] what did god say when they pray for you
[1:27:44] you will be healed
[1:27:46] so when they pray for you
[1:27:48] you believe
[1:27:50] you are healed
[1:27:51] now if the symptoms remain
[1:27:53] keep praising god
[1:27:55] keep praising keep washing
[1:27:57] hallelujah
[1:27:59] hallelujah don't begin doubting
[1:28:02] huh if you are taking your medicine keep
[1:28:04] taking your medicine
[1:28:06] while believing you are
[1:28:07] healed remember it's not the medicine
[1:28:09] that heals this god that heals
[1:28:11] all right so
[1:28:13] if you take that medicine it will help
[1:28:15] your body boost your immunity and then
[1:28:18] uh god is able to uh to be able to
[1:28:21] create a new life because these are
[1:28:23] cells you know cells can die and other
[1:28:25] cells are born and others are dying but
[1:28:27] it is a god who is able to use all that
[1:28:29] mechanism to bring forth life in your
[1:28:31] body and you can also do it without even
[1:28:33] medicine at all
[1:28:35] it all depends on your faith
[1:28:37] but faith doesn't mean lack of music
[1:28:39] medicine
[1:28:40] so we don't want you to have a wrong
[1:28:42] idea here
[1:28:44] god uses hearts and hubs is medicine
[1:28:47] okay so he said he has created need for
[1:28:49] medicine than for medicine so even some
[1:28:52] of these hubs which are misused like in
[1:28:54] jagger it is god who created did you
[1:28:56] think it was those people who created it
[1:28:58] there are safari people
[1:28:59] it was god who created it for what
[1:29:01] purpose for medicine
[1:29:05] and this man was saying that he he found
[1:29:07] something which can treat covet
[1:29:10] confidence and he called it confidence
[1:29:13] yes
[1:29:21] look
[1:29:22] these friends of yours first of all they
[1:29:24] are not they are not believers
[1:29:28] not so
[1:29:30] usually
[1:29:31] even alcohol they say we are using it
[1:29:33] for medicine so you don't want to be
[1:29:35] inspired by a wrong from a wrong
[1:29:37] inspiration
[1:29:39] you need to be inspired
[1:29:40] from the world
[1:29:42] whatever it is that you do you might you
[1:29:44] need to be inspired that's why we need
[1:29:45] the holy spirit in our life because you
[1:29:47] cannot be able to design and certainly
[1:29:49] this guy is using weed and claiming it
[1:29:51] is medicine but actually they are taking
[1:29:54] it directly like this and it hits them
[1:29:57] because weed if you take it
[1:29:59] not in the right portion you can even
[1:30:01] die
[1:30:03] so they abuse it generally speaking
[1:30:07] if we is used for medicine you cannot
[1:30:09] even know you've taken it and it will
[1:30:11] even be in very small portions and those
[1:30:13] questions that's why science now has
[1:30:15] come you know they can be able to know
[1:30:17] which portion
[1:30:18] has how much and it can be you know most
[1:30:21] of these
[1:30:22] i i don't know how the antidepressants
[1:30:24] or whatever they the weight is inside
[1:30:26] there
[1:30:27] yes what is inside there there's
[1:30:29] medicine for pain and the sedation
[1:30:31] sedations and all that kind of thing
[1:30:32] with this inside there did you know that
[1:30:34] that's right what is inside there you
[1:30:37] see that's why they they say don't use
[1:30:39] it when you're like this don't use it
[1:30:40] because when you use it those things
[1:30:42] will happen to you you know so some of
[1:30:45] those medicines are even like diazepam
[1:30:48] don't go by but there's a pump because
[1:30:50] if you buy the azepam and you take it
[1:30:52] you know you'll become addicted
[1:30:54] and when you become addicted you're like
[1:30:56] someone who is taking weed
[1:30:59] so
[1:31:00] indeed this medicine is taken from those
[1:31:02] habs
[1:31:03] but even at that time god knew god had
[1:31:05] people that had the wisdom to do those
[1:31:08] habs in a way that would help the people
[1:31:10] even today we still have them
[1:31:12] so perhaps taking habits is not a scene
[1:31:14] as long as it is taken by someone who
[1:31:17] has the right inspiration who is
[1:31:19] inspiring them you know i don't want to
[1:31:21] take habs from a witch doctor
[1:31:24] okay i don't want to check herbs from
[1:31:26] you know so who is inspired what is
[1:31:27] their inspiration you understand yes so
[1:31:30] even the medications you know we don't
[1:31:32] have sometimes there are certain
[1:31:33] medicines me i cannot take what was the
[1:31:35] inspiration so usually you have to look
[1:31:37] at that but the issue is god uses all
[1:31:40] these things but certain times you can
[1:31:42] even take medicine and you don't get get
[1:31:44] well but as a child of god where the
[1:31:47] honor to get well the point here is one
[1:31:50] always you must believe
[1:31:53] that when you pray god answers your
[1:31:56] prayer
[1:31:57] now whether or not it materializes
[1:31:59] that's really up to god
[1:32:01] believe it has happened
[1:32:03] believe it has happened
[1:32:05] and keep believing it has happened
[1:32:08] if god wants it to be on you for very
[1:32:10] long
[1:32:11] it will be for a purpose
[1:32:14] it will be for a purpose there is no
[1:32:16] problem that comes to me without a
[1:32:17] purpose
[1:32:19] hallelujah
[1:32:20] i told you about cover 19 then give you
[1:32:22] the testimony yes that was a purpose
[1:32:25] hallelujah
[1:32:26] yes
[1:32:29] so friends
[1:32:31] let us continue because we may
[1:32:35] can you open that book
[1:32:41] the synagogue of saturn
[1:32:47] it is all right
[1:32:49] he says money isn't everything money
[1:32:50] isn't the answer and today it's not the
[1:32:53] answer either we have more wealth than
[1:32:55] we have ever had and yet less is being
[1:32:57] accomplished spiritually so it's not
[1:32:59] with money that god works god moves by
[1:33:01] his spirit
[1:33:04] you believe that
[1:33:05] and the moving of the of spirit comes
[1:33:07] only to a life consecrated to the wise
[1:33:11] amen amen
[1:33:14] all right
[1:33:19] [Music]
[1:33:21] i knew they blessed many of them which
[1:33:23] say they are jews and are not
[1:33:26] but at the synagogue of saturn
[1:33:28] here is a verse that will they have
[1:33:30] considerable
[1:33:32] not only because it is most
[1:33:48] i
[1:34:01] to begin with the word
[1:34:04] juice does not describe the religion
[1:34:09] [Music]
[1:34:11] same precise meaning
[1:34:13] if i want to say i
[1:34:15] am irish born
[1:34:17] people were saying that they were
[1:34:20] actually used
[1:34:21] real juice by birth
[1:34:26] just like that
[1:34:28] they were like as they were not used by
[1:34:30] birth and they
[1:34:40] [Music]
[1:34:44] they belong to the phones by him
[1:34:46] they were not of the true church but of
[1:34:49] the false church because god said they
[1:34:52] were the sinner book of satan
[1:34:54] now the word for synagogue is not the
[1:34:56] same word we use for church
[1:34:58] in the bible church means the quran ones
[1:35:02] or the summoned ones
[1:35:04] the sermons say
[1:35:06] about these elected people
[1:35:08] blessed is the man whom
[1:35:11] now chooses and causes should
[1:35:14] approach and to do it
[1:35:18] that he may join in then quotes
[1:35:22] some such as uh
[1:35:25] but the meaning of is assembly
[1:35:29] this can be good or bad
[1:35:31] but in this case it is bad for these are
[1:35:34] they whose assembling is not of good but
[1:35:36] of their own sales
[1:35:38] as i said
[1:35:40] isaiah
[1:35:42] behold they shall surely gather together
[1:35:45] but not by me whosoever shall gather
[1:35:47] together against thee shall fall for thy
[1:35:49] sin
[1:35:50] isaiah chapter 54 hallelujah
[1:35:54] since these were surely against the
[1:35:57] trumpet
[1:35:58] god will one day deal with them in
[1:36:00] destruction
[1:36:01] now why do we have a people mixed in the
[1:36:04] framework of the church and calling
[1:36:06] themselves jews the reason is this
[1:36:09] since they were like as they would make
[1:36:11] any claim they wished they would say
[1:36:14] that what they wanted as though it was a
[1:36:17] fact and then stick to it and in this
[1:36:20] case they would be lying with a very
[1:36:22] powerful thought in mind
[1:36:24] was it not so that the early church was
[1:36:27] almost
[1:36:28] if not entire entirely composed of jews
[1:36:32] making them the original members of his
[1:36:34] body the chain of apostles were jews and
[1:36:38] later apostles were a abuse of first
[1:36:40] lives
[1:36:41] that's for men to swear they were used
[1:36:44] to give them a
[1:36:46] preeminence and a claim of originality
[1:36:56] [Music]
[1:37:02] of originality
[1:37:04] tell a
[1:37:07] [Music]
[1:37:21] [Music]
[1:37:23] and that salvation is found only in
[1:37:25] health
[1:37:26] when they claim that they have the keys
[1:37:29] of the kingdom which they receive from
[1:37:31] peter
[1:37:32] and they claim that peter was their
[1:37:34] first pope and that he
[1:37:36] resided in rome
[1:37:38] when there is absolutely no historical
[1:37:40] fact for it
[1:37:42] and even her most educated annoying
[1:37:44] inheritance
[1:37:47] synagogue
[1:37:48] and if saturn be her father and he the
[1:37:51] father of liars of lies
[1:37:54] then it is not strange that those in his
[1:37:56] synagogue are liars also
[1:37:59] consider the thought of blasphemy
[1:38:01] these of certain syllables were not
[1:38:03] bloodstream including these instances
[1:38:06] though that go
[1:38:07] into brackets
[1:38:09] though that
[1:38:10] though that goes without saying
[1:38:14] but why but they were blaspheming their
[1:38:16] true church
[1:38:18] suddenly as kane participated and killed
[1:38:20] abram because he
[1:38:22] came was
[1:38:24] that we came
[1:38:26] and as they did for
[1:38:28] good good followers
[1:38:30] these are say they were of their father
[1:38:33] they were
[1:38:34] trying to destroy the equations in the
[1:38:36] first few years of the first age
[1:38:39] now the same group
[1:38:41] which is the false fine is even more
[1:38:44] strongly attempting to destroy the
[1:38:46] true believer in the second age
[1:38:49] that antichrist spirit is growing
[1:38:51] the group that inched its way ever so
[1:38:54] slowly into the church by its kids
[1:38:57] nikolai
[1:38:58] nikolai
[1:39:00] nikolai tenism
[1:39:02] no longer fears exposure but is openly
[1:39:05] organized in a group of its own
[1:39:07] ascending and is coming against the true
[1:39:10] church in this
[1:39:11] hostility
[1:39:13] now when i say this was unorganized and
[1:39:15] christchurch i am giving you the truth
[1:39:19] from an authenticated history
[1:39:22] the first church of the rome
[1:39:25] will address his history in the paganian
[1:39:28] age
[1:39:33] but
[1:39:34] the first the first
[1:39:35] church found in rome had already turned
[1:39:38] the truth of god into a lie by
[1:39:40] introducing a pagan religion with
[1:39:43] christian names and meaning
[1:39:45] by a second age it was a
[1:39:48] pagan
[1:39:49] so claiming to be the true church that
[1:39:52] polycarp came about
[1:39:54] 1500 miles at a very old age they played
[1:39:58] with them to turn back they would not do
[1:40:01] it
[1:40:01] they had a solid hierarchy and a solid
[1:40:04] organization and a complete departure
[1:40:06] from the world
[1:40:08] this then a certain synagogue full of
[1:40:10] blasphemy
[1:40:12] in which were already the seeds of the
[1:40:15] doctrine of the politician
[1:40:17] and which would shortly be the absolute
[1:40:20] power or satanic religion
[1:40:23] and this is exactly right for revelation
[1:40:25] chapter 2 verse 9
[1:40:27] does not say these people
[1:40:30] does not say these people
[1:40:34] are of certain synagogue but it says
[1:40:36] they are certain synagogue
[1:40:38] this spirit of antichrist is not new
[1:40:40] this is not something that just came in
[1:40:43] the churches
[1:40:44] just been here all alone
[1:40:47] to get a clear understanding of how it
[1:40:49] works
[1:40:50] okay can someone help him
[1:40:59] can you switch
[1:41:17] how it goes against god
[1:41:19] and takes over in the church
[1:41:22] look at the old testament and see be
[1:41:25] there
[1:41:26] let us examine this spirit as
[1:41:29] it was manifested in israel
[1:41:31] as she came out of egypt to be a church
[1:41:34] in the wilderness
[1:41:37] just as the early church started out
[1:41:40] under the pure ministry of the holy
[1:41:42] spirit
[1:41:43] with signs and wonders and
[1:41:45] manifestations such as prophecy
[1:41:47] dance and interpretation
[1:41:50] wisdom knowledge and healing
[1:41:53] so in the days of israel
[1:41:55] when they left egypt
[1:41:57] they were under the leadership of the
[1:41:59] quality
[1:42:00] they were under the leadership of the
[1:42:02] spirit of god
[1:42:03] manifesting in gifts
[1:42:06] god was the leader of the people
[1:42:08] actually he was their king
[1:42:11] he was the father king
[1:42:13] he took care of israel like a man cares
[1:42:17] for his family
[1:42:18] he fed them fought their battles
[1:42:21] smoothed away their difficulties and
[1:42:24] settled their problems
[1:42:27] he just
[1:42:28] he just
[1:42:30] boosted himself over them
[1:42:33] they were
[1:42:34] the only nation
[1:42:36] to which he was truly
[1:42:39] god
[1:42:40] but
[1:42:41] one day they got to looking around
[1:42:44] and they saw
[1:42:46] the philistines and their nations with
[1:42:49] kings over over them
[1:42:53] and other
[1:42:54] nations but but but one day they got to
[1:42:58] looking around
[1:42:59] and they saw the philistines and other
[1:43:01] nations with kings over them
[1:43:04] they caught their eyes and they decided
[1:43:06] that they they called
[1:43:09] humanize their leadership
[1:43:12] so they wanted a king
[1:43:15] now god was going to humanize the
[1:43:17] leadership himself
[1:43:19] in the person of the lord jesus christ
[1:43:23] but they got ahead of him
[1:43:26] saturn knew
[1:43:27] the plan of god so he put it in the
[1:43:31] hearts of the people to get ahead of god
[1:43:35] the world
[1:43:37] when they approached someone and asked
[1:43:39] for a king
[1:43:41] someone was
[1:43:42] this
[1:43:43] dismantled
[1:43:45] that his
[1:43:46] this one
[1:43:48] he smiled
[1:43:50] that his heart almost failed him
[1:43:52] god had had been leading his people
[1:43:56] through his consecrated scripture
[1:43:58] scripture vindicated prophet
[1:44:01] and he he felt
[1:44:03] that he had been rejected
[1:44:06] he gathered the people
[1:44:08] and pleaded with them
[1:44:10] not to turn away from god
[1:44:13] okay
[1:44:13] so uh
[1:44:15] you see
[1:44:17] from down here it talks about the
[1:44:19] nicolan
[1:44:20] nicolantinism
[1:44:22] he talks about the seed the saturn is
[1:44:24] synagogue
[1:44:26] and we know that the nicole the seed
[1:44:28] which was planted
[1:44:30] in the first age
[1:44:32] the ephesian age the seed of nicolas
[1:44:34] remember what it was being
[1:44:38] what was it doing
[1:44:43] what is nuclear antenna someone
[1:44:47] you have to speak up so that the the
[1:44:49] speaker can capture your
[1:44:51] uh a microphone can capture your voice
[1:44:57] yes conquering of this
[1:45:00] have you heard that yes
[1:45:02] the people being put under the control
[1:45:04] and leadership of a man
[1:45:07] what man says is fine
[1:45:10] so that was the seed of nickelodeonism
[1:45:14] which was at that time a deep something
[1:45:17] which was being done by a group of
[1:45:19] people
[1:45:20] that were anointed by that wrong spirit
[1:45:23] but that spirit was growing growing
[1:45:25] growing
[1:45:26] now we're in the second age
[1:45:28] and the bible talks about
[1:45:30] the synagogue
[1:45:32] of saturn not those ones who are of the
[1:45:35] synagogue of saturn but the very
[1:45:37] synagogue of saturn
[1:45:39] and synagogue is a gathering
[1:45:41] so he says it is a bad gathering
[1:45:44] these people who are gathering together
[1:45:47] and remember they were calling
[1:45:49] themselves the church
[1:45:51] but by this time they have not yet
[1:45:52] nominated
[1:45:54] but they wanted kind of like israel how
[1:45:57] the israel wanted to have a man
[1:45:59] to rule
[1:46:00] over them
[1:46:01] instead of
[1:46:03] god
[1:46:04] but but the man here says that
[1:46:06] you see
[1:46:07] god wanted to give them a man that was
[1:46:09] jesus christ
[1:46:10] but for them they want a head of god
[1:46:12] always don't go ahead of god
[1:46:14] when you want something and you pray for
[1:46:16] it and you don't get it don't push god
[1:46:18] wait on him
[1:46:21] wait
[1:46:23] sometimes you may be like ah me i'm
[1:46:25] giving up things are not happening
[1:46:26] either way what
[1:46:28] don't do that
[1:46:30] always wait on god
[1:46:32] because they that wait
[1:46:35] upon the lord join me now
[1:46:39] shall renew
[1:46:42] their
[1:46:42] strength
[1:46:44] they shall mount up
[1:46:48] with wings
[1:46:50] as any
[1:46:55] they shall run
[1:46:58] and not be wary
[1:47:01] they shall work
[1:47:04] unknown faith imagine
[1:47:19] they that wait
[1:47:29] oh
[1:47:30] they shall mount up
[1:47:33] [Music]
[1:47:34] with
[1:47:36] as he
[1:47:38] goes
[1:47:42] they shall
[1:47:43] run and not be wary
[1:47:48] they shall
[1:47:54] [Music]
[1:48:02] one more time oh
[1:48:05] now
[1:48:06] they that way
[1:48:08] my sister my brother wait on him
[1:48:12] shall renew
[1:48:15] their strength
[1:48:20] [Music]
[1:48:24] as he
[1:48:26] goes
[1:48:29] they shall rise
[1:48:32] and not be wary
[1:48:35] they shall walk
[1:48:38] and not faith
[1:48:41] teach me lord
[1:48:44] teach me
[1:48:46] lord to
[1:48:48] wait
[1:48:51] teach me lord
[1:48:54] tease me lord
[1:48:57] teach me lord
[1:49:06] you know sometimes the blessing is just
[1:49:08] about to come
[1:49:10] and then someone gives up
[1:49:14] you know some people the devil deceives
[1:49:16] them
[1:49:17] and then they kind of say let me go on
[1:49:20] back a slide
[1:49:22] oh
[1:49:24] as god is living and in heaven let none
[1:49:27] of you ever do that
[1:49:29] hallelujah
[1:49:30] ask yourself
[1:49:32] because whoever is telling you let me go
[1:49:33] and be back asleep is not you it is a
[1:49:35] spirit a wrong spirit so ask talk back
[1:49:38] to it and say
[1:49:39] why are you going to back a slide
[1:49:41] or why do you want me to backslide and
[1:49:43] listen to those reasons they are all
[1:49:45] nothing
[1:49:47] you know the reason is usually never
[1:49:49] gives
[1:49:50] it is taking too long
[1:49:51] it will never happen
[1:49:53] you know look at this look at that look
[1:49:55] at this
[1:49:56] israel wanted a king but god was
[1:49:59] preparing for a king a befitting king
[1:50:02] for them
[1:50:03] but they landed on their own kings you
[1:50:06] know who they they got so
[1:50:09] david
[1:50:10] i saw that was not even willing to obey
[1:50:13] the voice of god i saw that you know
[1:50:16] made them suffer
[1:50:17] you know a david that you know was able
[1:50:20] to commit adultery and kill them
[1:50:22] you know a solomon you know all these
[1:50:25] kings had good parts on them but also
[1:50:27] they had a bad person on them
[1:50:30] and he said that you have hundred kings
[1:50:32] they will rule over they will because
[1:50:34] king here was
[1:50:36] a king is someone who has a domain and
[1:50:38] rules over as he wishes
[1:50:40] but god did not want israel to be
[1:50:42] subjected to an earthly king for man to
[1:50:45] rule over them because man will put his
[1:50:47] will on them
[1:50:48] god has always wanted to put his will on
[1:50:50] his children but the people have always
[1:50:53] desired to rush into receiving lordship
[1:50:57] don't rush to receive leadership in your
[1:50:59] life let god himself give you lordship
[1:51:01] so you see then they ended up indeed
[1:51:04] they ended up just like physical israel
[1:51:06] did the church also did the same thing
[1:51:08] they erected a man to become the head of
[1:51:11] the church and that materialized in the
[1:51:13] second in the third age which is coming
[1:51:15] pegamos
[1:51:16] but here we see the seeds of that
[1:51:18] growing maturing being watered
[1:51:21] are you following
[1:51:23] yet god had always wanted to be
[1:51:26] their own father you see
[1:51:28] and god has told us to come out of them
[1:51:30] like these denominations which our first
[1:51:32] denominations inspired by a wrong spirit
[1:51:34] to come out of them those churches that
[1:51:36] are having men ruling over the people to
[1:51:39] come out of them because god that's why
[1:51:41] this message is not anymore a man ruling
[1:51:44] over yeah this message is now the holy
[1:51:46] spirit again taking over rulership and
[1:51:49] headship of the church
[1:51:51] hallelujah
[1:51:52] you see god has always desired to have
[1:51:55] headship
[1:51:57] hallelujah all right you see so when
[1:51:59] samson cut off cut off his hair he was
[1:52:01] like any other man put the leadership of
[1:52:03] the holy ghost aside and the church is
[1:52:05] nothing but the world with god's name
[1:52:07] attached to it when they put the holy
[1:52:09] ghost or the holy spirit aside they
[1:52:12] become like samson
[1:52:14] but when he has no more strength on him
[1:52:17] you see the leadership of the holy
[1:52:19] spirit is the most important thing
[1:52:28] did you understand what i say
[1:52:30] some of you didn't understand oh this is
[1:52:32] an english
[1:52:34] fellowship i tell you this is for most
[1:52:35] of them don't understand uganda
[1:52:38] when you take the holy spirit out of the
[1:52:40] church
[1:52:41] the church has become simply a husk
[1:52:45] without life in it
[1:52:48] without anything you know
[1:52:50] completely not no life
[1:52:52] you see so it doesn't matter if you call
[1:52:54] yourself a christian anyone can do that
[1:52:56] the point is whether or not you have the
[1:52:58] spirit of god in you
[1:53:00] for without the spirit you are a
[1:53:02] reprobate you are none of yes
[1:53:05] you know when you read this church edge
[1:53:07] book and finish it by the time you are
[1:53:08] done
[1:53:09] you realize the major point that
[1:53:11] abandonment was emphasizing all
[1:53:12] throughout
[1:53:13] is to
[1:53:14] have the holy spirit and be led of him
[1:53:16] yes and number two
[1:53:18] to believe the word
[1:53:20] the inspiration of the holy spirit of
[1:53:22] the world in every age
[1:53:25] those two things
[1:53:26] because they are the same thing you know
[1:53:28] you cannot separate the holy spirit from
[1:53:30] the word and you cannot separate the
[1:53:32] word from the holy spirit it has always
[1:53:34] gone hand in hand
[1:53:37] if you believe that true teaching of the
[1:53:38] word but without the life of it
[1:53:40] you still do not have
[1:53:42] anything so i wonder why in the message
[1:53:45] some people say that the holy spirit is
[1:53:47] adultery you know as if that someone has
[1:53:50] a doctrine of the holy spirit i don't
[1:53:51] believe that
[1:53:52] it shouldn't even be treated as such
[1:53:56] if you treat it as such it's like these
[1:53:59] people today who have made oblocally
[1:54:02] to be saved they've made a denomination
[1:54:06] how can you make born again the
[1:54:07] denomination
[1:54:08] my national fellowship born again
[1:54:10] churches how can you even make a
[1:54:12] denomination and call it born again
[1:54:14] churches
[1:54:15] one again is not a denomination
[1:54:17] it's not a church
[1:54:19] it is a people who have had an
[1:54:21] experience with god
[1:54:23] people who have believed the word and
[1:54:24] have been filled with the holy ghost
[1:54:25] that's what it means to be born again
[1:54:27] but this people made denomination out of
[1:54:29] it
[1:54:31] so
[1:54:31] even in the message we should learn that
[1:54:34] we should never never accept
[1:54:37] for you to be
[1:54:39] put to a certain group
[1:54:41] because you you have emphasized the holy
[1:54:44] spirit or you have emphasized the word
[1:54:46] you must emphasize the word and you must
[1:54:48] emphasize the holy spirit if people
[1:54:50] think you are of the other group or the
[1:54:52] other it is their problem you are doing
[1:54:53] what is right
[1:54:55] this is what the message says i will do
[1:54:56] it you see that's why for for me i've
[1:54:59] always had this group that group this
[1:55:01] group many of thunders man your holy
[1:55:02] spirit this money that i don't care
[1:55:04] those are just the nomenclatures of
[1:55:06] people
[1:55:07] me where is my side my side is on the
[1:55:09] word of god
[1:55:11] and the manifestation of the spirit
[1:55:14] those two things is what we have seen
[1:55:16] in the bible in this message
[1:55:18] this message teaches us two things the
[1:55:20] true word of god
[1:55:22] and the manifestation of the spirit
[1:55:24] which gave that word yes
[1:55:27] and brother banamiya says that point the
[1:55:29] point is whether or not you have the
[1:55:31] spirit of god in you for without that
[1:55:33] spirit you are i reprobate i don't care
[1:55:35] whether you know but without that spirit
[1:55:37] you are what
[1:55:39] you are none of his
[1:55:42] so my dear
[1:55:43] my dear friends
[1:55:45] please get the spirit of god
[1:55:47] that you see how bad how serious it is
[1:55:50] for you to get the spirit of god
[1:55:52] how serious it is
[1:55:55] even if it needs you to go
[1:55:57] lock yourself up in your bedroom and
[1:55:59] pray until you receive the holy spirit
[1:56:01] do that
[1:56:03] you know
[1:56:04] it's not about the action of locking
[1:56:06] yourself and you know praying it's about
[1:56:09] the hunger and the desire for him
[1:56:11] you know it can happen anytime on you
[1:56:13] you know wherever you are you know you
[1:56:16] want to buy best in his presence and you
[1:56:18] know allow him to feel you alive from it
[1:56:21] through your heart to the exit whereby
[1:56:23] you know when he comes you are one of us
[1:56:26] going to go in the rapture because you
[1:56:27] have received a life
[1:56:29] his life in you
[1:56:31] you see so do not allow anyone to
[1:56:34] say that this is a pentecostal thing no
[1:56:37] she's not too long ago i asked a lady if
[1:56:39] she were a christian she said to me i'll
[1:56:41] have you know sir that i ban a candle
[1:56:43] every night
[1:56:45] what in the world has that got got to do
[1:56:47] with it i'm a methodist i'm a baptist
[1:56:49] i'm a pentecostal that has nothing to do
[1:56:51] with it
[1:56:53] i am a days of the voice fellowship
[1:56:55] ayama shakaina whatever i am uh
[1:57:02] i am a speckled bird ayama
[1:57:05] ayama come on give me those names
[1:57:08] revealed whatever
[1:57:14] please
[1:57:14] these are the voices leave these things
[1:57:16] aside
[1:57:18] as a matter of fact you as younger
[1:57:20] people huh yes you must not go out there
[1:57:22] to publicize the name of our
[1:57:25] denomination let me call it that way
[1:57:27] we are not said to
[1:57:29] publicize the name of the denomination
[1:57:32] well it's not a sin if you talk we
[1:57:34] church you fellowship in it's not a sin
[1:57:36] okay but
[1:57:38] people
[1:57:39] i fear even it is coming in the message
[1:57:41] whereby
[1:57:42] the names of their churches are so
[1:57:44] highly lifted up
[1:57:47] than even christ himself
[1:57:49] but the panel says i don't care what you
[1:57:51] say you are that has nothing to do with
[1:57:53] it it is the holy ghost or perish
[1:57:57] hallelujah it is the holy ghost or
[1:58:00] perish whatever you claim you are it is
[1:58:03] nothing
[1:58:04] receive the holy ghost or perish that's
[1:58:06] true
[1:58:07] and of course by the time he says
[1:58:08] receive the holy ghost
[1:58:10] means you've already received the word
[1:58:12] see starting where back there in the
[1:58:14] first church that people go to thinking
[1:58:16] and reasoning how to improve on god you
[1:58:18] know the deeds of the nicolas began
[1:58:20] showing themselves then a group formed
[1:58:23] they drifted away from the pattern of
[1:58:24] the one
[1:58:25] all it takes is is just one word changed
[1:58:28] under and a little even then leaving the
[1:58:30] whole lamp he that offends in one point
[1:58:33] of the law is guilty of all even just
[1:58:37] if just change the one word
[1:58:39] that will do
[1:58:42] that will do it and when someone centred
[1:58:44] the group
[1:58:45] and when that southern centered group
[1:58:46] was formed it began to hate and to fight
[1:58:49] the true believers insisting that they
[1:58:52] they the aliens were the church of god
[1:58:55] imagine the catholic church it says here
[1:58:57] they they but we know it is the
[1:58:58] catholics of course the catholicism they
[1:59:00] were saying that they are the true
[1:59:02] church of god
[1:59:03] notice how organization breeds hatred
[1:59:06] organization raise that rate i tell you
[1:59:08] take it from the prophet here
[1:59:11] organization breeds what
[1:59:14] you are your which church
[1:59:17] you ever please those things they bring
[1:59:19] hatred
[1:59:20] they make you see someone as if they are
[1:59:22] not believers
[1:59:24] please if you're going to be the
[1:59:26] standard business standard in this
[1:59:28] country
[1:59:31] god is looking for people who are going
[1:59:32] to be the standard everywhere
[1:59:35] whereby your standard is the word and if
[1:59:38] your word is your standard then you're
[1:59:40] going to be the standard everywhere you
[1:59:41] go because you will be a product of the
[1:59:43] world
[1:59:44] are you following yes
[1:59:46] do not lift up the name of your
[1:59:48] organization
[1:59:50] and do not agree with anyone who does
[1:59:54] it is not the church fellowship in these
[1:59:56] are fellowships please
[1:59:58] please can you hear me
[2:00:01] these are what
[2:00:04] but what is important
[2:00:09] he says notice how organization breeds
[2:00:12] hatred
[2:00:13] it destroys what
[2:00:15] yes
[2:00:18] it makes bitterness
[2:00:20] that is what
[2:00:22] this is what mana was full of
[2:00:25] bitterness
[2:00:28] a root off
[2:00:30] defies many
[2:00:32] so more and more defilement was coming
[2:00:34] in
[2:00:37] every age would feel its scars
[2:00:41] bitterness
[2:00:43] do not allow
[2:00:45] yourself to be organized organization
[2:00:47] the one he's talking about is not
[2:00:48] talking about he's not saying that you
[2:00:50] as a person must not be disorganized
[2:00:53] because we are not an organization does
[2:00:54] not mean we are disorganized
[2:00:57] no
[2:00:58] he is meaning
[2:00:59] you lifting up the name of your
[2:01:02] organization now the name of our
[2:01:04] organization
[2:01:05] is
[2:01:07] these are the rich ministries
[2:01:09] that's the our organization okay
[2:01:13] it's an organization because it is
[2:01:15] independent it is self-existent
[2:01:18] it doesn't need another one to exist
[2:01:20] we don't need little local charge to
[2:01:23] exist
[2:01:24] we are independent
[2:01:26] but
[2:01:27] that is nothing
[2:01:29] don't leave don't begin lifting it up
[2:01:33] slapping people with it everywhere
[2:01:37] what is important is christ
[2:01:40] these are names
[2:01:42] that we we have because of the laws of
[2:01:44] the country
[2:01:45] you cannot operate at a shop without a
[2:01:48] name but whether your name is the
[2:01:52] have it all goods or have nothing all
[2:01:55] goods all i care is whether inside there
[2:01:58] there are things that i am looking for
[2:02:00] so if i enter there and i find you have
[2:02:02] glucose i find you have water
[2:02:06] i find you have a nano
[2:02:08] i find you have a dukket
[2:02:10] oh that's the rich language now
[2:02:12] i find whether you have you understand
[2:02:15] yes
[2:02:16] if you have what i need then i will
[2:02:17] enter in
[2:02:19] and i'll buy from you
[2:02:21] you understand yes
[2:02:23] but you find people these days fighting
[2:02:24] over show up names
[2:02:26] is there is a issue the shop names
[2:02:32] it's just shops
[2:02:33] how does as well said it's just shops
[2:02:37] enter the shop because it is selling
[2:02:38] what you need
[2:02:40] what do you need water
[2:02:42] what do you need the word the water of
[2:02:45] the word so is this organization giving
[2:02:48] it to you yes then stick there but also
[2:02:51] do not again begin praising the
[2:02:53] organization right thank god for my
[2:02:55] organization
[2:02:58] and they begin to say if you don't come
[2:03:00] to this church you are lost are they the
[2:03:02] owners of heaven
[2:03:05] are they the ones with the kids of
[2:03:06] heaven
[2:03:08] please let us never come to that level
[2:03:10] when you listen to the by the way let me
[2:03:12] tell you people listen to the prophet
[2:03:14] when you listen to that message you
[2:03:16] begin to hear
[2:03:17] you begin to hear him emphasizing that
[2:03:20] when you begin to hear an
[2:03:23] organization belong here you are lost it
[2:03:25] is the first one
[2:03:26] it's the first one
[2:03:28] it means they have already become a
[2:03:30] denomination
[2:03:31] [Music]
[2:03:35] whether you attend any fellowship i
[2:03:37] don't care the issue is are you
[2:03:38] receiving the word do you believe the
[2:03:40] word true
[2:03:42] you have you received the holy ghost
[2:03:44] are you baptizing the holy ghost
[2:03:46] those are the two things that care the
[2:03:48] rest is
[2:03:49] not
[2:03:50] non-issues
[2:03:54] do you believe what i'm saying yes
[2:03:55] because it's here
[2:03:57] you see organization breeds hatred
[2:04:00] it destroys fellowship
[2:04:03] we're really supposed to be one big
[2:04:04] fellowship that's true
[2:04:06] when you hear someone just believe why
[2:04:08] you believe the message
[2:04:10] god bless you but these days it is
[2:04:12] changing brother the video of the
[2:04:14] message yes which group
[2:04:17] which group of the message
[2:04:21] when you tell them
[2:04:22] sometimes they even
[2:04:23] you know ask you which church are you
[2:04:25] from
[2:04:26] i don't care brother we just give me now
[2:04:29] i am from i'm coming from the church of
[2:04:30] the first born i am from the church of
[2:04:32] the believers i am a believer i am a son
[2:04:35] of god hallelujah i am filled with the
[2:04:36] holy
[2:04:40] you know it is destroying fellowship
[2:04:43] the moment you tell them i am from
[2:04:45] little flock i am from days of the voice
[2:04:47] fellowship this is a number ah okay
[2:05:04] ah
[2:05:19] that should you should not allow it to
[2:05:21] come among us yes
[2:05:22] you should not allow with friends you
[2:05:24] should not it is a bad thing and i say
[2:05:27] it with bitterness in my heart also
[2:05:29] that's true
[2:05:30] not the bitterness of the bad one the
[2:05:31] good one
[2:05:34] it is bad
[2:05:36] don't allow yourself to this fellowship
[2:05:38] other brethren because they are not from
[2:05:39] your church
[2:05:42] we are one members of the same
[2:05:44] fellowship
[2:05:46] the fellowship of believers
[2:05:48] and we must not allow ourselves to be
[2:05:50] segregated to be divided to be broken
[2:05:52] into pieces
[2:05:53] the other church if they preach the
[2:05:55] message they are my brothers if they
[2:05:56] they are
[2:05:58] my brothers if they think they have a
[2:05:59] special revelation that is their issue
[2:06:02] that's right all i know is i have a
[2:06:04] special revelation also and i will not
[2:06:06] just fellowship someone as long as they
[2:06:08] believe the message to the excellent one
[2:06:10] play by the banham had a brother and his
[2:06:12] name was gina jackson
[2:06:15] junior jackson believed the message was
[2:06:17] a preacher in america
[2:06:19] and by the bottom preached church order
[2:06:21] and junior jackson never applied it in
[2:06:23] his church
[2:06:25] and and by the ban i'm preaching that uh
[2:06:27] you know in you know when when people
[2:06:29] are speaking in tanks you know they
[2:06:31] should be able to interpret it uh and it
[2:06:33] should be done before the staff so you
[2:06:34] know what about the balance says and uh
[2:06:37] gina jackson said no that's okay but
[2:06:39] it's for brother branham turbina for us
[2:06:41] here we apply we do it the way we feel
[2:06:43] led
[2:06:44] and how are they doing it is that if you
[2:06:46] you're speaking things you can speak at
[2:06:48] any time
[2:06:49] and you can all pray you know let us all
[2:06:51] pray in times
[2:06:52] and this was a belief of the message
[2:06:55] and the believers in madame tabanaco
[2:06:57] started calling those believers in that
[2:06:58] other church
[2:07:00] uh
[2:07:01] black birds what were they calling them
[2:07:04] someone gave me that name i think black
[2:07:06] a birds or something like that
[2:07:09] black about and then by the bottom when
[2:07:10] you had everything they said what did i
[2:07:12] hear
[2:07:13] he said never do that again amen what
[2:07:15] were they calling them
[2:07:16] he said never do that again
[2:07:19] but the junior jackson is my brother
[2:07:22] he's my brother he's a believer of this
[2:07:24] message as far as i know this is what
[2:07:25] the prophet is saying
[2:07:28] he says if he wants to teach his church
[2:07:30] that it's up to him
[2:07:31] he will answer for that on the day of
[2:07:33] judgment but as far as i am concerned
[2:07:35] he's my brother
[2:07:36] the believers they are my brothers
[2:07:39] hallelujah amen so friends never ever
[2:07:41] disfellowship anyone as long as they are
[2:07:43] believers of the message
[2:07:46] whether they say they believe that seven
[2:07:47] thunders or the eighth hundreds of the
[2:07:49] ten thunders as long as they believe the
[2:07:50] message that's right okay the more
[2:07:54] revelation they have that's up to them
[2:07:56] leave them with those revelations if
[2:07:58] they say brother do you have something
[2:08:00] say well i don't
[2:08:01] as long as there's a message brother if
[2:08:03] they show you a quote you say yeah i
[2:08:05] mean i believe that
[2:08:06] they show another quote oh man i believe
[2:08:08] that so what are you fighting about
[2:08:12] but brother you are
[2:08:13] believing in the wrong way you believe
[2:08:15] brother please please brother you can
[2:08:16] remember the explanations but i believe
[2:08:18] this message i'm reading here i believe
[2:08:20] what i am seeing here for your
[2:08:22] explanations you can remain with them
[2:08:24] brother but you are my brother that's
[2:08:26] all that matters hallelujah
[2:08:28] that's the attitude that we ought to
[2:08:30] have as believers of this precious
[2:08:31] message
[2:08:33] don't divide yourselves and separate
[2:08:35] yourselves and get groups and hear you
[2:08:37] know
[2:08:37] you know
[2:08:40] this money and church had drifted far
[2:08:42] from the original it had become a hybrid
[2:08:45] it had hybridized itself in the way of
[2:08:47] eve
[2:08:48] you know that a hybrid is what comes
[2:08:50] over the two species mixing the result
[2:08:53] is no longer pure like the original it
[2:08:55] is mongrel where when he allowed the
[2:08:58] beast to mingle his seed with us she
[2:09:00] produced a creature called cane that
[2:09:02] wasn't pure human he was of the wicked
[2:09:05] one notice how different he was from
[2:09:08] aber notice how different he was from
[2:09:10] seth he hated god and would not obey the
[2:09:13] word and persecuted and killed the
[2:09:14] writers he set himself up
[2:09:18] above the word of god you see what it
[2:09:20] happens when you mix up yourself with
[2:09:22] the things that are not the word
[2:09:24] don't hybridize yourself
[2:09:26] now then i
[2:09:27] you know you know i believe that each of
[2:09:29] you have read line by line okay so i'm
[2:09:32] only taking a few highlights that i
[2:09:34] thought that it could be highlighted for
[2:09:35] us here and brother in the rest of the
[2:09:38] paragraph that talks about high breeding
[2:09:39] hybridizing hybridizing and you know
[2:09:41] what hybridizing is is a mixture to mix
[2:09:44] the wrong and right don't mix when you
[2:09:46] mix you get something which seems as if
[2:09:48] it is strong but when it is really mixed
[2:09:50] up some people are mixing the message
[2:09:51] with their own ideas don't mix this
[2:09:53] message with your ideas if someone is
[2:09:56] doing that leave them alone leave that
[2:09:57] thing alone always have sweetness around
[2:10:00] you
[2:10:01] welcome everybody be receptive if
[2:10:03] you know they kind of try to say
[2:10:05] something that you feel is wrong listen
[2:10:07] to them a little more listen to them if
[2:10:08] it's not really right it's not clicking
[2:10:10] with you leave it alone and still love
[2:10:12] the person you see that's the attitude
[2:10:14] and the nature of jesus christ
[2:10:17] see the ass can be read okay fine
[2:10:20] um
[2:10:22] he talks about hybrid ready john
[2:10:25] eve hybrid ready john and
[2:10:30] it was money and age was dying when it
[2:10:32] died it never came back
[2:10:35] no age ever comes back no revival ever
[2:10:37] comes back it can't have the life of god
[2:10:40] in it by natural generation it takes a
[2:10:42] regeneration from above the last edge
[2:10:44] started with the fires over pentecostal
[2:10:46] revival and they organized it right back
[2:10:48] instead of taking the word they took
[2:10:50] their own ideas and did just what every
[2:10:52] age has done
[2:10:54] sabji substituted the manual
[2:10:57] for the word you know
[2:10:59] they they substituted the manual
[2:11:02] for the word
[2:11:03] meaning they have their own church
[2:11:04] manuals
[2:11:06] you know
[2:11:07] uh their own church manuals which they
[2:11:09] now have instead of the word of god
[2:11:12] don't substitute the word of god the
[2:11:14] bible this message for anything else
[2:11:18] this last age started with the fires of
[2:11:20] a pentecostal okay where was i
[2:11:28] then he says
[2:11:32] excuse me
[2:11:36] he says
[2:11:37] instead of taking the word they took
[2:11:39] their own ideas
[2:11:40] and they did just
[2:11:42] whatever age has done
[2:11:44] substitute the money for the word just
[2:11:46] you step outside the manual
[2:11:48] just you step outside that manual and
[2:11:50] see what happens you are out brother and
[2:11:53] they will persecute you and blame it on
[2:11:55] god
[2:11:57] hallelujah he says step out of that
[2:11:59] money and see what will happen
[2:12:01] hallelujah
[2:12:02] oh my that's why you should give this
[2:12:04] book to other those that have wanted to
[2:12:06] believe this message if they read this
[2:12:08] statement you'll hit them
[2:12:10] step out of that money meaning the
[2:12:12] church money step out of it and see what
[2:12:13] will happen they will persecute you and
[2:12:15] then they blame it on god
[2:12:17] and they love the organization no wonder
[2:12:19] they are they are second generation
[2:12:21] pentecostals they are second generation
[2:12:23] pentecostals and since god doesn't have
[2:12:25] grandchildren but you put it off it was
[2:12:27] just down there you know we're still on
[2:12:28] the same line i don't know why you are
[2:12:30] putting it up just keep rolling down
[2:12:33] um
[2:12:34] they are second generation pentecostals
[2:12:36] and since god doesn't have grandchildren
[2:12:38] they are just
[2:12:39] children of their fathers known by their
[2:12:41] creeds and and and form of fellowship
[2:12:44] they can talk about what used to be but
[2:12:46] they can't produce it oh my jesus christ
[2:12:49] can someone explain this point for me i
[2:12:51] need someone to talk about this what i
[2:12:53] just read
[2:12:56] yes
[2:12:59] what i've understood from this point is
[2:13:00] that these people they created their own
[2:13:04] crates
[2:13:05] obviously they were not a board
[2:13:08] and they are following they are fathers
[2:13:12] so
[2:13:15] here it says that
[2:13:16] women have grandchildren
[2:13:19] so they are following their fathers so
[2:13:21] it's like they are grandchildren
[2:13:23] you can say that they have got them
[2:13:25] maybe like grandchildren
[2:13:27] well my god
[2:13:32] you see they are following their fathers
[2:13:35] they are following their mothers they
[2:13:37] are following their family members
[2:13:39] they are following their brothers and
[2:13:41] sisters
[2:13:42] you know
[2:13:43] the all they know is by their creeds and
[2:13:45] form of worship
[2:13:47] they can talk about what used to be
[2:13:50] who are these people these are the ones
[2:13:52] who can do what
[2:13:53] talk about what
[2:13:55] what used to be
[2:13:57] but they
[2:13:58] can't produce it but they
[2:14:01] thank you are you with me
[2:14:05] but they cannot work
[2:14:09] but somebody has to go together

[2:14:20] you see
[2:14:21] you can stand surely you can stand and
[2:14:23] fall

[2:14:29] but they cannot produce it
[2:14:32] they cannot
[2:14:34] but
[2:14:35] these people can talk about what used to
[2:14:36] be
[2:14:37] but they cannot produce it what they
[2:14:40] used to hear but they cannot
[2:14:43] what about the venom deep but they

[2:17:28] sometimes we preach it like this and
[2:17:30] then people look for other ways of
[2:17:33] talking to you why do you want me to
[2:17:34] talk to you in another way than this
[2:17:36] well this is the best way of talking
[2:17:37] friends
[2:17:38] [Music]
[2:17:39] yes by the way we can talk to one
[2:17:41] another if i've already told you leave
[2:17:43] your talk and you were here listening to
[2:17:44] me and again you wanted me to deprive it
[2:17:46] what is wrong with you
[2:17:50] you know one time paul told the the
[2:17:52] russians what is wrong with who
[2:17:53] bewitched you
[2:17:55] because paul was telling them the truth
[2:17:57] and they hear it and then they go there
[2:17:58] someone tells them something else they
[2:18:00] also do it
[2:18:01] sometimes we come here we preach we
[2:18:03] preach don't dress shut things me up
[2:18:05] what what you find someone still
[2:18:07] dressing them what is wrong with you
[2:18:09] can't you understand or you have a
[2:18:10] problem

[2:18:14] father is not my father
[2:18:17] amen yes
[2:18:18] we need to talk like that now sometimes
[2:18:21] not say about republican do you agree
[2:18:22] with me yes yes
[2:18:25] the world should change
[2:18:26] changing powers in the world it is not
[2:18:28] in the in in the private talks
[2:18:32] private counseling wasting a lot of time
[2:18:34] for nothing
[2:18:35] counseling should be you should seek for
[2:18:38] counseling only when you have been
[2:18:40] dealing with things and trying to
[2:18:42] struggle and to leave you that you can't
[2:18:43] and you need counseling you really need
[2:18:44] help
[2:18:46] you have to understand not just wasting
[2:18:48] time over preacher it comes to you you
[2:18:49] ask
[2:18:50] things which are answered in the
[2:18:52] preaching
[2:18:53] wasting a lot of valuable time
[2:18:56] then you also become like a talker talk
[2:18:58] you see
[2:18:59] they they can talk about it what used to
[2:19:02] be but they can't produce it
[2:19:05] they can't let us produce that life
[2:19:09] oh
[2:19:10] god help us
[2:19:12] brothers sisters
[2:19:14] let us produce that life
[2:19:17] let us produce it it must be the salt of
[2:19:19] the earth
[2:19:20] be the poor don't just come here and
[2:19:22] hear about it and then talk about it but
[2:19:25] your life is dry nothing there
[2:19:28] we heard about the life of god
[2:19:30] manifestation of the spirit what's the
[2:19:31] manifestation of the spirit speaking
[2:19:33] entire times praying in the spirit and
[2:19:36] the interpretation of that and you can
[2:19:37] be able to say everything but when you
[2:19:39] see your life you are right
[2:19:43] you don't dream you don't see visions
[2:19:45] you you you don't talk tongues you don't
[2:19:48] need to freak thanks you don't pray
[2:19:51] you don't sing you don't do nothing but
[2:19:54] you're talking talking talking about it
[2:19:56] wasting people's time
[2:19:59] oh
[2:20:00] [Music]
[2:20:03] i'm sorry you know something just came
[2:20:05] and took me over i hope it was the holy
[2:20:06] spirit i believe it was the holy spirit
[2:20:08] friends
[2:20:09] we should manifest these things we
[2:20:11] should allow we should produce not
[2:20:13] manifest because it is not as we
[2:20:14] manifest
[2:20:15] it's not the orange that manifests the
[2:20:17] orange it is the life in it that brings
[2:20:19] it out if you do not have the these
[2:20:21] things ask god to give you the holy
[2:20:23] ghost because if you don't have the holy
[2:20:25] ghost and you try to manifest it you
[2:20:27] will only try to
[2:20:28] do what the pentecostals are doing
[2:20:30] they're impersonating it because they
[2:20:32] have no life
[2:20:33] but one time when the world always fills
[2:20:36] your life
[2:20:37] oh i tell you you will get into realms
[2:20:40] that you have never gotten into ever
[2:20:41] before amen when you go into prayer
[2:20:45] get closed in with god and you know
[2:20:47] listen to the spirit of god you know
[2:20:50] and all your soul body and spirit and
[2:20:52] allow him to permit through your body
[2:20:54] and soul and spirit to the extent
[2:20:57] whereby you can come and take over your
[2:20:59] mind brother
[2:21:00] your mind brother whereby you go to so
[2:21:03] and so brother who has been also praying
[2:21:05] with you in the same room and you don't
[2:21:06] even know what he has been on his heart
[2:21:08] about him there you've got to even tell
[2:21:10] him brother hear the word of the lord
[2:21:12] that says the holy spirit blah blah blah
[2:21:14] blah and everything is what has been
[2:21:16] praying for that's what we are looking
[2:21:17] for
[2:21:18] the manifestation of that spirit because
[2:21:21] we don't want to talk talk talk talk but
[2:21:23] there is no production
[2:21:25] we must produce the life
[2:21:28] not only those manifestations but we
[2:21:29] must also produce
[2:21:32] the the the the the the right feuds
[2:21:36] we must show that we are changed
[2:21:38] we must produce that kind of life
[2:21:40] if you were wearing a miniskirt scrap it
[2:21:42] straight away
[2:21:44] if you were you know having girlfriends
[2:21:46] boyfriends kind of separate yourself
[2:21:49] do it don't just you know hear about it
[2:21:51] do it brother you get a point let me
[2:21:54] tell you a true child of god how they
[2:21:55] behave the moment they hear about the
[2:21:57] word they are convicted and i didn't
[2:21:59] know they go and do it immediately amen
[2:22:02] this is how i was when i came to this
[2:22:04] message i was not born in the message
[2:22:05] when i came
[2:22:06] into this message i did not know what
[2:22:08] was right and what was wrong
[2:22:11] some of the things which i knew was
[2:22:12] wrong i found out
[2:22:14] it was wrong some of the things which i
[2:22:16] did not know that they were wrong i
[2:22:18] found out it was wrong so whenever i
[2:22:19] would hear a picture preaching it i
[2:22:21] would not reason with him
[2:22:22] i would go oh no i didn't know really i
[2:22:25] said oh god forgive me i go change it i
[2:22:27] will change it i will change it the
[2:22:28] moment the day i had it i believe and
[2:22:30] under no circumstances i'm unbeliever
[2:22:32] hey i said i didn't know
[2:22:34] me i thought that as long as you can
[2:22:36] preach them they believe you can bring
[2:22:37] them or you can talk to them and they
[2:22:39] they just come to church and then marry
[2:22:41] them and then they can believe any time
[2:22:43] at first i thought like that you know so
[2:22:45] i had my friends who were girls at at
[2:22:47] school and i told you that there are no
[2:22:48] friends who are girls if their friends
[2:22:50] are they're girls they're girlfriends
[2:22:52] okay don't deceive us you don't come and
[2:22:54] talk in languages which you don't
[2:22:56] understand
[2:22:58] i have
[2:22:59] friends which are your friends
[2:23:01] you know boys there are boys there but a
[2:23:03] very close friend of mine
[2:23:04] so are they your boyfriends no don't
[2:23:06] deceive us
[2:23:08] they're just obvious why what kind of
[2:23:10] thing is that
[2:23:12] what what extent okay fine it's okay to
[2:23:14] have a hobbies with you and all this but
[2:23:16] how long do you talk with them you find
[2:23:18] a brother talking with an old gift for
[2:23:20] almost six hours a day and then she says
[2:23:23] just a friend but not a girlfriend but
[2:23:25] just a friend that brother needs god
[2:23:29] you know when i had this thing for the
[2:23:30] first time i did not i had all those
[2:23:33] girlfriends of mine you know and uh
[2:23:36] i did not defile myself with them no i
[2:23:38] didn't do that but you see i was their
[2:23:41] friends you know would do hung up
[2:23:43] together
[2:23:44] on on phone you know i i was rich at
[2:23:46] that time even i had my i had my nokia
[2:23:49] father today

[2:23:52] ten yeah i had a thousand two ten years

[2:23:56] whatever so i would hang out with them
[2:23:58] sometimes you would go how are you
[2:24:00] saying i'm fine yeah i was the crazy
[2:24:03] yeah you know

[2:24:06] out
[2:24:07] you know you think it is a not harmless
[2:24:10] i'm full at all but when the preacher
[2:24:12] preached it in the church
[2:24:14] hey
[2:24:16] hey
[2:24:17] my heart was like why
[2:24:19] that is wrong i didn't know oh god

[2:24:23] i surrendered i went and scrapped off
[2:24:26] that
[2:24:27] phones it from my phone i cut off the
[2:24:29] communication i cleared up my myself and
[2:24:33] whenever i would meet them share the
[2:24:34] word that's no no further stories into
[2:24:36] their lives into my life
[2:24:38] i had already had you cannot marry and
[2:24:40] believe
[2:24:45] you see i already knew that the moment
[2:24:48] you know something don't fight with god
[2:24:50] if you begin fighting it means you're
[2:24:51] listening with god
[2:24:53] you're trying to say you are trying to
[2:24:54] make first god accept you the way you
[2:24:56] are
[2:24:58] don't be like okay be like abby when god
[2:25:01] tells him something he does it but cain
[2:25:03] he wants to go to accept him the way he
[2:25:05] is
[2:25:06] don't do that
[2:25:07] let god change you when you hear
[2:25:09] something for your first time even if
[2:25:11] you had never heard of it now you have
[2:25:12] heard it and god will judge you if you
[2:25:14] don't do it
[2:25:15] you see
[2:25:16] so even these things i'm talking about
[2:25:18] the manifestation of the life of jesus
[2:25:20] christ in you you know through the
[2:25:22] theme the the the feast of the spirit
[2:25:26] the manifestation of the of the gifts of
[2:25:28] the holy spirit in your life i'm not
[2:25:29] just talking about it for us to hear a
[2:25:31] very good story that's you know the true
[2:25:34] church always has a manifestation of the
[2:25:37] gifts of the spirit ah they talk tongues
[2:25:40] and they you know shout and sing yeah
[2:25:43] and then just leave it there and then we
[2:25:44] go to another chapter
[2:25:46] then i should close my books and then i
[2:25:48] say i will never go into this bible
[2:25:49] study again
[2:25:50] if i'm not going to see those things
[2:25:52] happening then we don't even need to do
[2:25:54] what we are doing
[2:25:55] if i'm not going to see people feeling
[2:25:57] god with the holy spirit then i don't
[2:25:58] need to continue being what i'm doing
[2:26:00] because it means god has not blessed it
[2:26:02] let me see those things happening let me
[2:26:05] see that life of jesus christ god wants
[2:26:07] to see it in our life yes or else what
[2:26:10] we're doing we're just bluffing we're
[2:26:11] just playing around

[2:28:16] amen
[2:28:18] i tell you can i read it again yes
[2:28:21] the only way i know the only watch
[2:28:36] in the church
[2:28:38] when a little noise gets started
[2:28:39] somewhere
[2:28:42] you know just a little amen
[2:28:45] once in a while or a little something
[2:28:46] you know make a little noise
[2:28:50] this is something you can choose to do
[2:28:51] you know no one is trusting you you know
[2:28:53] you hear the word that you choose to
[2:28:55] shout amen or just to be there
[2:29:01] you know
[2:29:02] the prophet tells you make a what
[2:29:06] some of them said well by the ban i mean
[2:29:07] it is emotional
[2:29:10] well i can't scientifically prove to you
[2:29:12] anything without emotion is dead that's
[2:29:14] true
[2:29:15] so if your religion hasn't got any
[2:29:17] emotion
[2:29:19] by the thing
[2:29:20] [Laughter]
[2:29:21] if your religion has not got what
[2:29:24] any emotion body
[2:29:27] but i eat it is dead my dear
[2:29:29] by that thing
[2:29:31] because it is no good
[2:29:33] it is dead
[2:29:35] how many believe that
[2:29:38] what i'm saying you people
[2:29:41] do not ever fear that when i do this way
[2:29:44] when the holy spirit moves on you you
[2:29:45] know sometimes you know i remember when
[2:29:48] i was still young
[2:29:50] in the church
[2:29:51] i didn't
[2:29:52] there were there were no people in the
[2:29:54] church at that time you know shouting
[2:29:56] and
[2:29:57] you know saying a man and running around
[2:30:00] so
[2:30:00] many times when the word would be
[2:30:02] preached but let me tell you the truth
[2:30:04] of the matter is if you are a seed of
[2:30:06] god and the word of god is being
[2:30:07] preached to you
[2:30:10] even if you are dead you will come alive
[2:30:12] because at that time i had not known all
[2:30:14] the things i know today
[2:30:16] i had not known you know most of the
[2:30:18] mysteries even though the message but
[2:30:20] simple preachings you know pastor would
[2:30:22] preach and ministers would come and
[2:30:23] preach but whenever they're preaching
[2:30:25] you know people many of them were new in
[2:30:26] the message so but we'll just sit and
[2:30:28] listen to the word and say amen you know
[2:30:30] what's the word but sometimes you know
[2:30:33] i would be preaching until i feel like
[2:30:35] shouting i just feel like maybe standing
[2:30:38] up and you're shouting or crying but
[2:30:40] then i look around
[2:30:41] you know and then i see no one is
[2:30:43] feeling the way i'm feeling i'm like oh
[2:30:45] god and then i leave it i need to you
[2:30:47] know go there inside and then something
[2:30:50] i want to pick up
[2:30:51] and push and pressure then i would be
[2:30:52] like
[2:30:53] look around
[2:30:55] no one is being hit and then i'll be
[2:30:56] ashamed
[2:30:59] sometimes i would literally groan um
[2:31:02] you know let me tell you don't do that i
[2:31:04] did it but don't do it
[2:31:07] i did it but the moment god set me free
[2:31:10] and god gave us more revelations i never
[2:31:12] thought from that time i never
[2:31:15] close that
[2:31:16] a feeling you know right
[2:31:19] don't close it in
[2:31:21] when the word of god is going in and
[2:31:23] you're feeling to shout the feeling to
[2:31:25] jump your feelings run around you're
[2:31:26] feeling to clap your hands your feelings
[2:31:28] to prophesy
[2:31:29] don't resist
[2:31:32] the holy spirit
[2:31:34] don't
[2:31:35] resist the holy spirit
[2:31:38] you know what i'm talking about yes i'm
[2:31:39] not preaching emotions to you i am i am
[2:31:42] teaching to you that you must arrive
[2:31:44] because you see it it's all about you
[2:31:47] your choices
[2:31:49] if the holy spirit comes down
[2:31:51] and and you do not do anything you don't
[2:31:53] you know you ask what do you have in the
[2:31:54] hands if you remain like that
[2:31:57] what do you have in the earth moses
[2:32:01] i'm just here god i said i have a stick
[2:32:05] you understand
[2:32:06] so what you have is your child what you
[2:32:08] have is your club so god can move on you
[2:32:10] i don't know i'm not saying he will tell
[2:32:12] you to clap but he might tell you to
[2:32:13] clap
[2:32:14] i'm not saying he will tell you i don't
[2:32:16] have to be the one to tell you to do
[2:32:18] that right
[2:32:19] the holy spirit
[2:32:21] knows what is right at that moment maybe
[2:32:22] when you do that very thing that you
[2:32:24] have told you to do like you told us
[2:32:25] people to run around that city seven
[2:32:28] times of jericho
[2:32:30] you know when you tell them to do that
[2:32:31] yes something happened so it tells you
[2:32:34] to do something whatever it is that he
[2:32:35] has told you and you refuse to do it
[2:32:37] maybe that one or is it going to be the
[2:32:38] source of your deliverance
[2:32:40] and just be there
[2:32:42] when you refuse to do it
[2:32:44] and you'll be there
[2:32:45] nothing will happen for sure i'll tell
[2:32:47] you that nothing will happen you will
[2:32:49] have you are the religion you will come
[2:32:51] in the church with that religion you
[2:32:52] will walk out with it
[2:32:54] and some people they be busy for god you
[2:32:56] know they are on the phone when the what
[2:32:58] is going on or they're thinking about
[2:32:59] still god cannot walk through you or
[2:33:01] what i'm saying that for him to speak to
[2:33:03] he can't speak to you you need to open
[2:33:05] your mind
[2:33:07] you want to avail yourself for him when
[2:33:09] he comes down and when he comes down and
[2:33:11] you are available you avail yourself
[2:33:14] things are bound to happen i tell you
[2:33:16] things are going to happen you know he's
[2:33:18] bound to move when you are he's about to
[2:33:19] feel you the holy ghost is bad maybe he
[2:33:21] can tell you you know run around shout
[2:33:23] do this
[2:33:24] you know
[2:33:25] kneel down
[2:33:26] simple simple things
[2:33:28] and you're like
[2:33:30] some people are like that
[2:33:31] god tells you to do
[2:33:32] something
[2:33:34] well even there is no time the pastor
[2:33:36] was saying we have only one minute
[2:33:38] you know don't ever do that
[2:33:40] you know
[2:33:41] yeah i'll do it when we have a longer
[2:33:43] service ah whatever i tell you god is
[2:33:45] not a god of time
[2:33:47] he's the god of eternity
[2:33:49] and therefore when he it shows up
[2:33:51] everything else we were going to do
[2:33:53] stops
[2:33:54] ah it is now almost six sunday when i
[2:33:56] begin shouting right now it may take a
[2:33:58] bit longer hey
[2:34:07] [Music]
[2:34:13] things begin to happen when you free
[2:34:14] yourself when you lose yourself
[2:34:17] when you lose yourself
[2:34:20] when chat begins i kind of feel that
[2:34:21] there's something what is going to do
[2:34:24] right here we're in the preparation of
[2:34:25] it
[2:34:26] when that's resumed something is going
[2:34:27] to happen in some people
[2:34:30] i really feel that struggle in my heart
[2:34:33] now he says but let them talk to you you
[2:34:35] can give it to me again and then we see
[2:34:37] where to stop because we have 30 minutes
[2:34:38] and we want to close now
[2:34:40] let them talk to you about the glories
[2:34:42] of their movement they will say yes sir
[2:34:44] i want you to know that this is a move
[2:34:46] that no man started it came
[2:34:48] spontaneously the spirit fell all over
[2:34:51] the world yes sir we got that we got
[2:34:53] what they had at pentecost this was not
[2:34:56] of men but of god then why didn't you
[2:34:58] why did they keep it that way if god
[2:35:01] started it how come god couldn't keep it
[2:35:03] and finish it and if they said they
[2:35:05] started when god was moving in when i
[2:35:07] believed the message oh i tell you i was
[2:35:09] praying like this i was doing this i was
[2:35:11] doing it now why are you not doing it
[2:35:12] anymore
[2:35:13] what what happened
[2:35:16] if god didn't write a handbook of grids
[2:35:17] and formulas and documents to start it
[2:35:19] then why
[2:35:21] what right did they have to do that yeah
[2:35:24] now they are he's talking about the
[2:35:25] denominations now yeah
[2:35:27] they have all those things now
[2:35:30] [Music]
[2:35:34] someone read for me that paragraph that
[2:35:36] next paragraph
[2:35:38] polycarp bridge
[2:35:40] an experiment yes god power
[2:35:46] word pod out history according baptist
[2:35:49] methodist netherlands
[2:35:51] adventists
[2:35:53] brethren of god
[2:35:56] several surnames etc all these brethren
[2:35:58] were brought up on different doctrines
[2:36:00] bylaws church manners etc
[2:36:03] what sucked it all to one side destroyed
[2:36:06] their dispensation of theories and
[2:36:08] restore the gifts of the spirit
[2:36:11] proving is the same yesterday and today
[2:36:14] and forever
[2:36:15] but did those pentecostals learn their
[2:36:18] lesson about organization no sir
[2:36:20] they organized right right back
[2:36:23] and have written their own textbooks
[2:36:26] bylaws and church menu fellowship book
[2:36:28] as a terror with one idea in mind which
[2:36:31] is to prove that they
[2:36:33] now have all the truth know the answers
[2:36:36] and therefore the allies of god
[2:36:39] who know the way and can show it and to
[2:36:42] others as god's appointed guides but
[2:36:44] they haven't got it they have they have
[2:36:46] hybridized
[2:36:48] themselves like the very groups they
[2:36:50] came out of if they want to be in their
[2:36:52] brain they are going to have to come out
[2:36:54] exactly as did their fathers hallelujah
[2:36:59] that is why in this message we don't
[2:37:01] have church menus
[2:37:03] that's why this message we don't have a
[2:37:05] church man doctrine man dr no money
[2:37:07] that if you want to know
[2:37:09] the doctrine of this church read this
[2:37:11] book
[2:37:12] i don't think i don't even know of nmsu
[2:37:14] church which has that
[2:37:16] hallelujah
[2:37:17] that's why this message cannot
[2:37:18] denominate this message you cannot
[2:37:21] denominate you see what we have in the
[2:37:24] message
[2:37:25] is god the leadership of there
[2:37:28] holy spirit
[2:37:29] we have the message
[2:37:31] we read our bible
[2:37:33] and that is it
[2:37:34] we i read it i can read a verse i can
[2:37:37] read our quote and then the next is the
[2:37:39] holy spirit interpreted for us
[2:37:42] through our preaching like how do you
[2:37:43] brothers preach what do you do when you
[2:37:45] go there before you even go there by the
[2:37:46] way what did you do before you started
[2:37:48] preaching you see you were led by the
[2:37:50] holy spirit you did not um
[2:37:53] uh god read from such money or what you
[2:37:56] say our such money is the word of god
[2:37:57] hallelujah we don't write my pastor
[2:38:00] wrote this and that every doctrine that
[2:38:02] should be taught whatever the word
[2:38:03] should be told it should be taught
[2:38:04] according to this book and you know
[2:38:07] you should read it like that
[2:38:09] you say that this one is like this you
[2:38:11] see even in this message that's why
[2:38:14] that when people read the message each
[2:38:16] of them comes out with their own opinion
[2:38:18] because it's not a manual a manual is a
[2:38:21] clear cut
[2:38:23] this is this and this is that and this
[2:38:25] is that period
[2:38:27] but this message
[2:38:28] has many rooms
[2:38:30] and many
[2:38:31] uh uh uh channels that people can be
[2:38:34] able to read and the holy spirit can be
[2:38:36] able to channel them the way he wants to
[2:38:37] channel those people at that time
[2:38:39] it's not like
[2:38:41] ammonia what's burning docker sweats
[2:38:43] bunny so
[2:38:45] it's it's not like in a menu yeah you
[2:38:47] know we are we are at home so i i i
[2:38:50] don't know you need to maybe check
[2:38:51] something
[2:38:52] so
[2:38:53] saints we are not in any denominational
[2:38:56] setup whereby uh
[2:38:59] we have a manual and things are have to
[2:39:01] be this way and things have to be that
[2:39:03] way no things have to be the way god
[2:39:06] wants it we we have the message and but
[2:39:08] abandonment was led by the spirit while
[2:39:10] he was preaching he didn't
[2:39:12] wasn't reading from a textbook he read
[2:39:14] and preached from the bible we read and
[2:39:17] preached from the bible hallelujah
[2:39:19] that's why sometimes i can quote there
[2:39:21] is no formula some now you are beginning
[2:39:23] to see do you by the way let me tell you
[2:39:25] now while we are still here hey sister
[2:39:27] doctors
[2:39:28] you need to come back and hear this also
[2:39:31] and all of you who are online
[2:39:33] please i wanted to hear this very very
[2:39:35] very very important
[2:39:38] there are some people that have come up
[2:39:40] with a very very bad idea
[2:39:43] i call it a bad idea because it is not a
[2:39:45] lead of god
[2:39:46] it's a wrong adultery it's a wrong
[2:39:48] spirit
[2:39:50] and they're saying that
[2:39:53] preachers must be silent
[2:39:55] and they must only read
[2:39:58] the message of brother banner
[2:40:03] so
[2:40:04] you get a message book do i have one
[2:40:06] here
[2:40:09] this one is a
[2:40:11] demonology
[2:40:13] so you take a demonology
[2:40:16] and begin reading
[2:40:18] for the believers
[2:40:22] so friends
[2:40:24] there
[2:40:25] we are going to preach about
[2:40:27] demonology
[2:40:28] the physical realm
[2:40:31] help of the lord we could carry the
[2:40:32] meeting right on through ourselves
[2:40:34] that's the reason i am glad to see it go
[2:40:36] over a little bit for that one reason i
[2:40:38] believe the lord will help us to do it
[2:40:41] congregation says amen now you know
[2:40:43] there is i love my management i have
[2:40:46] some lovely brethren
[2:40:47] bosworth baxter lindsay moore
[2:40:52] all those has got five of them brother
[2:40:54] back brother von braun back there
[2:40:57] what are you trying to do
[2:40:59] what's the point
[2:41:01] and after finishing the book
[2:41:02] they then you say ah man
[2:41:05] we shall we shall continue from there
[2:41:07] next sunday
[2:41:09] then you tell them bye
[2:41:11] now as i'm demonstrating this for you
[2:41:13] some of them are saying but reading the
[2:41:15] message is not bad
[2:41:17] and
[2:41:18] now that's not also right so it kind
[2:41:20] it's a wrong spirit
[2:41:21] which comes in a way
[2:41:23] it comes in a trail that we always go
[2:41:27] you know
[2:41:28] the holy spirit hated me right now
[2:41:32] the serpent
[2:41:33] this one we are talking of that woman
[2:41:34] jezebel
[2:41:36] they never they never knew how people
[2:41:38] can be trapped
[2:41:42] when you want to drop
[2:41:44] a certain animal in a forest
[2:41:47] you first of all should know the road it
[2:41:50] always
[2:41:51] takes
[2:41:53] if you want to drop a rat in your house
[2:41:56] you must know where it passes
[2:41:59] you will lay that snare in that very
[2:42:01] road where it passes
[2:42:04] the devil therefore knows that the only
[2:42:06] way he can drop people
[2:42:09] is through worship because people human
[2:42:12] beings are created with a desire to
[2:42:14] worship
[2:42:16] [Music]
[2:42:17] and therefore he has desired to ensnare
[2:42:21] and trap them through worship
[2:42:25] of the beast
[2:42:27] through worship
[2:42:29] in first denominations and religions
[2:42:32] you know that is how
[2:42:35] he will give them the mark of the beast
[2:42:36] through
[2:42:37] worship
[2:42:39] but also through worship
[2:42:41] worshipping the right to god
[2:42:43] you will get the true holy spirit
[2:42:46] so worship is it bad
[2:42:49] no
[2:42:50] but in this case it is worshiping the
[2:42:51] wrong thing
[2:42:53] they never know that's how you will trap
[2:42:54] them
[2:42:55] in the same way the same cunning devil
[2:42:58] he knows the only way he can get message
[2:43:00] believers
[2:43:02] is by attacking them through their
[2:43:04] message books
[2:43:06] one
[2:43:07] he has tried for very many years for
[2:43:09] more than 50 years now to make a message
[2:43:12] a believer stop listening to the depths
[2:43:14] to make them stop reading or not read at
[2:43:17] all and he has failed because the more
[2:43:19] he makes them to stop the more they read
[2:43:23] now he has devised
[2:43:25] another thing what he's going to do
[2:43:27] i'll make them get by a statute how
[2:43:30] he will inspire and anoint some certain
[2:43:32] men to come and bring first doctrines
[2:43:36] by the message how
[2:43:39] you know for us
[2:43:40] we are the believe the true believers of
[2:43:42] the message
[2:43:44] and if you are true believer of the
[2:43:45] message
[2:43:46] in your church you must do two things
[2:43:49] one you must play the table by the
[2:43:50] bottom only no preaching of any preacher
[2:43:53] or
[2:43:54] you must
[2:43:56] read only the message for the people and
[2:43:58] even if you're preaching you're
[2:43:59] preaching only from one message don't
[2:44:01] say now i'm preaching but let me all
[2:44:03] support from the church educate yourself
[2:44:04] from seven seas don't do that if you do
[2:44:07] that you are back as leading preachers
[2:44:10] that doctrine is ready
[2:44:13] they say if you do that your back is
[2:44:14] reading
[2:44:15] you must only read from one message you
[2:44:17] must only read the message you must only
[2:44:19] play tips for the people now what does
[2:44:21] it make other preachers
[2:44:22] who know that that's the wrong spirit
[2:44:24] they will say ah that's a wrong doctrine
[2:44:27] and the devil thinks he's going to make
[2:44:29] us now let us say we shall not read the
[2:44:30] messages anymore we shall now say we
[2:44:33] only read the bible because those ones
[2:44:35] are preaching the wrong doctrine
[2:44:37] the devil says ah i have not got them
[2:44:40] i have not got them they can no longer
[2:44:42] read the message they can no longer play
[2:44:44] the traps because i knew when i do like
[2:44:46] this they will now not play it they'll
[2:44:48] never read it let me tell you now i'm
[2:44:50] telling you because you're younger
[2:44:51] people this spirit is already out in the
[2:44:52] country it's read all over the world
[2:44:54] even here in uganda it's already here if
[2:44:56] you have not heard it of it yet
[2:44:58] and now you will face it one time
[2:45:00] let me tell you god is perfect will for
[2:45:03] this generation god this perfect will
[2:45:05] for this generation is the
[2:45:07] word yes and what is the word for this
[2:45:10] generation is the revelation of this
[2:45:13] bible by the prophet he has said in our
[2:45:15] generation
[2:45:16] no man can claim to know the message
[2:45:18] without reading the message books
[2:45:19] without listening to the tricks you
[2:45:21] understand but who told him that the
[2:45:22] banana is the only preacher in our
[2:45:24] generation there are many other
[2:45:25] preachers and they are going to be
[2:45:26] preaching from the inspiration of the
[2:45:28] prophet of the day
[2:45:31] hallelujah
[2:45:32] so see
[2:45:33] brother balaam said i preached what
[2:45:36] paul
[2:45:38] preached
[2:45:39] brother said that
[2:45:41] i preached what
[2:45:42] paul
[2:45:43] preached
[2:45:45] that's what he said
[2:45:45] [Music]
[2:45:47] what did the paul preach can we go there
[2:45:51] there are very many
[2:45:53] now
[2:45:54] first episode of paul
[2:45:56] the apostle to
[2:45:58] timothy who wrote this
[2:46:01] who wrote this answer me
[2:46:03] apostle paul
[2:46:04] but abandoned he preached what paul
[2:46:07] do you find him doing this
[2:46:09] paul
[2:46:10] an apostle of jesus christ by the
[2:46:12] commandment of god our savior and the
[2:46:13] lord jesus christ which is in our hope
[2:46:15] and to dream of fame my own son in the
[2:46:18] faith grace being mercy and from god i
[2:46:20] found in the lord jesus christ and i bet
[2:46:22] amen god bless you we shall meet and
[2:46:25] read from their next service
[2:46:27] do you find him doing that
[2:46:29] why
[2:46:30] yet he said he preached what paul
[2:46:31] preached
[2:46:33] to preach what by the bottom preaches
[2:46:34] does not mean i am going to become a
[2:46:36] parrot
[2:46:38] a parrot only reads nonstop
[2:46:43] doesn't have any more revelation doesn't
[2:46:46] have any more
[2:46:48] inspiration
[2:46:49] but the same oh
[2:46:51] it is burning in my heart i think i need
[2:46:53] to preach a message on this
[2:46:54] the same inspiration the same revelation
[2:46:58] that
[2:46:59] of the message is what we have received
[2:47:01] by reading his message
[2:47:03] the same spirit which he had the same
[2:47:05] holy ghost which he had is the same one
[2:47:07] of god which we have now
[2:47:09] hallelujah and therefore we can also
[2:47:11] preach from his message and quoting his
[2:47:14] message quoting the bible
[2:47:16] and even sometimes you can preach
[2:47:17] without quoting anything and we preach
[2:47:19] the same same thing which by the banana
[2:47:21] preached hallelujah because it is the
[2:47:23] same inspiration
[2:47:25] and now you find another group which is
[2:47:27] saying you know we have the same holy
[2:47:30] spirit here so it is the same revelation
[2:47:32] the same inspiration we don't need by
[2:47:34] the bottom at all because we can
[2:47:35] continue from where he stopped the rafa
[2:47:37] whatever he did full stop now let us
[2:47:39] continue from where he stopped then you
[2:47:41] will find them interpreting the things
[2:47:42] even but i'm already talked about in
[2:47:44] their own way
[2:47:46] you see those spirits are both ways
[2:47:48] that's right
[2:47:50] they will now say as if they are the
[2:47:52] only ones who believe in the holy spirit
[2:47:53] now those of you who are quoting by the
[2:47:55] banham for the people you are parrots
[2:47:58] we don't touch those because that's the
[2:48:00] demand that they said it's that demand
[2:48:02] what is life now now now is for me
[2:48:04] you're a person now right now what i'm
[2:48:06] saying is the one which is afresh
[2:48:09] that is also wrong with spirit it's also
[2:48:11] spirit from hell yes the true spirit or
[2:48:14] messenger of god when he comes yes he
[2:48:17] will speak like the other messenger
[2:48:19] spoke but he will also quote him
[2:48:23] read your bible very well jesus quoted
[2:48:26] the prophets
[2:48:28] paul it peter
[2:48:32] each of them were quoting each other the
[2:48:34] one who came later was putting the one
[2:48:36] who came in before he
[2:48:37] this is how the holy spirit works
[2:48:39] hallelujah
[2:48:41] why would peter paul even tell us
[2:48:43] believers in the uh ephesus to be
[2:48:45] baptized again
[2:48:47] because of what peter said in acts
[2:48:49] chapter two
[2:48:50] paul was quoting peter
[2:48:52] jesus we would say many times he was
[2:48:53] reading over me in the old of the old
[2:48:55] time john was quoting isaiah what are
[2:48:57] you talking about
[2:48:59] the true messenger will preach the same
[2:49:02] message but they will also quote
[2:49:05] they will record that message and they
[2:49:07] will now preach it in the power and in
[2:49:10] the demonstration of the spirit
[2:49:13] you understand whereby even when you are
[2:49:15] that's the purpose by the way of
[2:49:17] preaching so that when you are yeah
[2:49:18] there may be another letter what the
[2:49:20] preacher comes he has prayed after them
[2:49:22] by the mountain comes and it stands in
[2:49:24] the book and begins
[2:49:29] [Applause]
[2:49:31] what happened to you it is because the
[2:49:33] world was coming with such power the
[2:49:35] world was coming with such anointing
[2:49:37] which was fresh for your time but that
[2:49:40] brother was preaching by inspiration
[2:49:42] from the same message and the bible
[2:49:43] which you have
[2:49:44] you see so these two spirits we should
[2:49:46] watch them very very carefully
[2:49:48] they have come to destroy the church
[2:49:51] and we must know how to balance
[2:49:54] and stand in the right way what's the
[2:49:56] right way we believe the message we
[2:49:58] believe the bible we should listen to
[2:50:00] the message you should read the bible we
[2:50:01] should read the message you understand
[2:50:04] but also we must preach it
[2:50:06] let no man silence you if you're a
[2:50:08] preacher and you're going to be let no
[2:50:09] man tell you to keep quiet that's true
[2:50:11] the devil has always desired to do that
[2:50:13] let no man tell you to keep quiet let me
[2:50:15] tell you even if they tell me to keep
[2:50:16] going i cannot keep going even if i so
[2:50:18] wish to keep quiet i cannot find a stop
[2:50:20] button of keeping white
[2:50:22] hallelujah i can't
[2:50:24] because i am pressed already amen it's
[2:50:26] not me who press myself play preach it
[2:50:29] is god who put it in me and he who put
[2:50:31] it to me amen he keeps on even
[2:50:34] you know
[2:50:35] refiring it refining it every time
[2:50:37] putting more fire more fire more fire
[2:50:40] and even when i want to stop i can't
[2:50:41] stop
[2:50:42] even when i'm sick like that and i'm
[2:50:45] tired and i'm wearing when i begin
[2:50:46] preaching and waiting comes how dare you
[2:50:48] tell me that the holy spirit is not here
[2:50:49] because you know they will tell you they
[2:50:51] have many ways of channeling their ideas
[2:50:53] one of them came to me said
[2:50:55] the inspiration comes to you in a
[2:50:57] generation
[2:50:59] they did the deliberation of the word i
[2:51:01] said it by the bomb said the word
[2:51:05] are you a prophet
[2:51:07] in other words to say
[2:51:09] the word comes the inspiration comes to
[2:51:10] a prophet and you cannot receive
[2:51:12] inspiration
[2:51:13] i looked at him like that
[2:51:16] so in other words they are saying there
[2:51:18] is no more manifestation of
[2:51:20] the spirit what have we been reading
[2:51:21] from the very message they are saying
[2:51:23] they believe
[2:51:24] what have we been reading
[2:51:26] what are the two characteristics of the
[2:51:29] true church of the living god number one
[2:51:32] preaching the pure word of god don't
[2:51:34] don't skip don't skip number one
[2:51:36] preaching that viewer word of god
[2:51:39] hallelujah
[2:51:40] what is that what the apostles preached
[2:51:42] what the message speaks and number two
[2:51:47] the manifestation of the power of god
[2:51:51] hallelujah the manifestation through
[2:51:53] gifts of the spirit
[2:51:56] so then if how can you how can how can i
[2:51:59] prophesy unless i'm inspired
[2:52:02] how can i preach unless i am inspired
[2:52:04] how can i talk tongues unless i'm
[2:52:06] inspired so in other words you are
[2:52:07] shouting off all the inspiration you are
[2:52:08] saying that ended with the prophet you
[2:52:11] are now an unbeliever we have seen you
[2:52:12] we now know who you are because the
[2:52:14] message says you are an unbeliever if
[2:52:16] you don't be left in inspiration in our
[2:52:18] generation
[2:52:19] [Music]
[2:52:20] hallelujah
[2:52:22] oh i need to preach on this seriously
[2:52:24] because now i feel really anointed on
[2:52:26] this matter
[2:52:28] hallelujah
[2:52:29] god help us
[2:52:32] ah
[2:52:36] our time is done right so can we finish
[2:52:38] until we reach the 10 years of
[2:52:42] brother why did i feel that we will
[2:52:44] finish the discharge chapter
[2:52:46] today
[2:52:48] was i mistaken
[2:52:50] oh yeah i wasn't mistaken but what is it
[2:52:53] that we have done we have been taking it
[2:52:55] slowly in reading questions questions
[2:52:58] and questions which we were not doing at
[2:53:01] first we're just hovering over but i
[2:53:03] think what we're doing is good also
[2:53:06] amen so
[2:53:08] can someone read they are like all the
[2:53:10] rest
[2:53:14] they are like all the rest
[2:53:16] by the political can they proceed they
[2:53:18] are like all the rest the revival is
[2:53:20] over
[2:53:21] they are trying to leave a name and a
[2:53:23] dead
[2:53:24] they took organization and they took
[2:53:27] organization all the while talking about
[2:53:29] the spirit of god they talk about the
[2:53:31] evidence of the holy spirit but they
[2:53:33] forget that
[2:53:35] they forget that the devil can talk in
[2:53:37] terms to the utterance of confu of
[2:53:40] confusion of babel is in their midst and
[2:53:43] they call it the spirit of god once
[2:53:45] again
[2:53:46] we see man telling god instead of god
[2:53:49] telling man
[2:53:51] now you might deserve to scold me right
[2:53:54] here
[2:53:54] what i have said all right they call
[2:53:57] themselves in the boston and full gospel
[2:53:59] let me prove it at pentecost the fire
[2:54:02] came in a cloud and separated over each
[2:54:04] of them like at times and fell on each
[2:54:07] one why is the fire
[2:54:09] these tongues and pentacles and
[2:54:11] the whole people who listen understood
[2:54:13] why is that
[2:54:14] the whole multitude of believers acted
[2:54:17] like one family pentecostal as
[2:54:20] pentecostals are as badly divided as any
[2:54:23] group in history no man just joined
[2:54:26] himself to the early church but only god
[2:54:29] had it
[2:54:30] they have as many gods among them as any
[2:54:33] they claim to be full gospel
[2:54:36] but they can't prove it
[2:54:38] they are charged their touches as empty
[2:54:41] of power
[2:54:42] as any of them
[2:54:43] empty of power no power where is the
[2:54:46] power even in the message oh
[2:54:48] don't let me speak these things continue
[2:54:50] if they are full if they're full gospel
[2:54:53] then better admit the bible made a
[2:54:55] mistake when it describes the four goals
[2:54:57] for men and spectacles
[2:54:59] they seem
[2:55:00] there's been a great change in me
[2:55:02] they're right
[2:55:04] but the change has not been for the
[2:55:06] better
[2:55:07] it is time to get back to god it is time
[2:55:09] to get back to god
[2:55:11] they have a name that they live but a
[2:55:14] dead
[2:55:15] tongue isn't evidence the evidence of
[2:55:17] revival
[2:55:18] it is the evidence of death
[2:55:20] that's true
[2:55:22] that has proclaimed the evidence that
[2:55:25] the
[2:55:26] ceremonial
[2:55:27] religion of the jews was over that's
[2:55:30] that's a new era had begun tongues today
[2:55:33] is bringing down the cutting of the
[2:55:35] gentile church legends and the gospel is
[2:55:38] going back to the jews people are
[2:55:40] talking about terms erupting in a great
[2:55:42] spiritual move they have missed the
[2:55:44] words
[2:55:45] the truth is that it is writing
[2:55:48] is writing the finish to all man's ideas
[2:55:51] programs and kingdoms and the kingdom of
[2:55:53] god is being ushered in wake up people
[2:55:56] of god
[2:55:57] go back a little bit where are we
[2:56:00] now you might you might want to score me
[2:56:02] right here
[2:56:09] no no no
[2:56:10] it's time to get back to god okay
[2:56:12] yeah
[2:56:14] uh where he starts talking about tanks
[2:56:23] oh yeah right there right there it's uh
[2:56:26] time to get back to god begin there
[2:56:35] it is time to get back to good they have
[2:56:38] a name that they live but are dead
[2:56:41] tongues isn't the evidence of revival it
[2:56:44] is the evidence of death
[2:56:46] tons proclaimed the evidence that the
[2:56:49] ceremonial religion of the jews was over
[2:56:52] that a new era had begun
[2:56:55] tanks today is ringing down the cutting
[2:56:57] of the
[2:56:58] church ages and the gospel is going back
[2:57:00] to the jews people are talking about
[2:57:02] guns heroin herod
[2:57:04] in a great spiritual move they have
[2:57:06] missed a boat the truth is that
[2:57:09] it is writing
[2:57:11] writing the finish to all of
[2:57:13] man's ideas programs and kingdoms and
[2:57:16] the kingdom of god is being ushered in
[2:57:19] wake up people of god wake up if you
[2:57:22] don't think this is true just listen to
[2:57:25] this
[2:57:26] all over the world in both pentacles go
[2:57:28] back a little bit up
[2:57:34] the truth is that it is writing
[2:57:36] it is writing the finish to all of
[2:57:39] manny's just right there man's ideas
[2:57:42] problem don't go up brother
[2:57:45] uh just go down a little bit
[2:57:48] yes is that it is writing they finish
[2:57:51] the finish to all of man's ideas
[2:57:54] programs and kingdoms and the kingdom of
[2:57:57] god is being ushered in you see
[2:57:59] well it's not like saying that tongues
[2:58:02] are satanic and not good but he's saying
[2:58:04] that times god has always used times
[2:58:07] you check in the old testament he used
[2:58:09] time
[2:58:10] you know when the kingdom of was it
[2:58:11] never canada was ending yes he used
[2:58:14] times
[2:58:15] to show him it was a sign that your
[2:58:17] kingdom is coming to an end
[2:58:20] so even now
[2:58:22] trunks are being used
[2:58:24] the other pentecostals think oh it is a
[2:58:26] sign that it's a great revival and a
[2:58:27] great move of god no actually it is a
[2:58:30] great sign but what sign
[2:58:33] it is a sign that god is closing and
[2:58:36] finishing with the general dispensation
[2:58:38] and going going in over
[2:58:40] to bring his kingdom down hallelujah we
[2:58:43] know that's what's happening the kingdom
[2:58:45] of god is now about to come
[2:58:47] continue reading brother
[2:58:50] wake up people
[2:58:52] wake up
[2:58:53] if you don't think this is true just
[2:58:55] listen to this all over the world in
[2:58:58] both pentacles
[2:59:00] in those pentecostal and fundamental
[2:59:02] groups they are organizing a businessman
[2:59:05] they have invented the pulpit without a
[2:59:08] call from god they have styled
[2:59:10] themselves they
[2:59:12] they have still themselves
[2:59:16] the officials of men and the founders of
[2:59:18] a move of good and they accept the
[2:59:21] gifted ministry of ephesians chapter 4
[2:59:24] verse 10 to 13 that god gave the
[2:59:27] churches
[2:59:28] god gave the church
[2:59:30] has failed
[2:59:33] so they are taking over here we are
[2:59:36] right in the midst of the fulfillment of
[2:59:38] profession called the against saying or
[2:59:41] quora
[2:59:43] and they don't even know that they have
[2:59:46] fulfilled it they are blindly going on
[2:59:48] preaching experience for clothes
[2:59:51] may god have pity on them may their eyes
[2:59:53] be opened before it is too late all
[2:59:57] listen to me when did the prestige of
[2:59:59] money social leadership business ability
[3:00:03] or sheer mental prowess ever qualify a
[3:00:07] man for spiritual leadership or give any
[3:00:09] way to the one word and when in any way
[3:00:14] material maturity or human values begin
[3:00:17] to show as the media
[3:00:20] by which god works instead of the holy
[3:00:22] spirit alone then we are fighting
[3:00:24] against god not for him
[3:00:26] now i want this one report right here i
[3:00:29] am not speaking against elders in the
[3:00:31] church no sir
[3:00:33] and that elder can and that elder can be
[3:00:36] as poor as any man who has given up
[3:00:40] or be the richest man in the world
[3:00:43] as long as he is an elder in heart and
[3:00:47] i would not expect to
[3:00:49] ordain any man that has the real
[3:00:51] spiritual
[3:00:52] qualification as an elder what he called
[3:00:54] regardless of his finances or social
[3:00:57] position
[3:00:58] but when you see a social or financial
[3:01:00] structure come into the church
[3:01:03] that divides
[3:01:04] the folks in any way that is not of god
[3:01:08] it is another sign of the time
[3:01:10] it is physically rich
[3:01:14] but spiritually improved in overwatch or
[3:01:18] impoverished now nation age in which we
[3:01:22] are now living i know they provide did
[3:01:25] you notice that their property is linked
[3:01:27] up with the synagogue of saturn in the
[3:01:30] same bus yes
[3:01:32] it is the rich powerful organization
[3:01:34] that has the world and always pushes out
[3:01:37] the little people
[3:01:43] moves in the hearts of men
[3:01:45] who is it that leaves the building
[3:01:49] and equality
[3:01:51] the life the little flock
[3:01:54] always loses out to the big organization
[3:01:56] and where do the people then go they
[3:01:59] worship in homes old stock buildings and
[3:02:01] basements just as they did when they
[3:02:04] went today
[3:02:06] cutting homes
[3:02:09] these people were poor in this world's
[3:02:11] goods
[3:02:13] suddenly but they were rich in spirit i
[3:02:16] know they are blaspheming
[3:02:17] now it isn't the thought here that these
[3:02:21] liars are blaspheming good
[3:02:23] though that goes without saying
[3:02:26] but they are blaspheming the true church
[3:02:28] it is always thus
[3:02:31] the jews of jerusalem plus film the
[3:02:33] church at the beginning
[3:02:35] the gentile politic
[3:02:37] politics
[3:02:39] did likewise if anyone is going to be
[3:02:43] spoken of
[3:02:44] it will always be the true seed in
[3:02:47] narrows day
[3:02:48] the christians were blamed for every
[3:02:51] calamity even for the burning of rome
[3:02:55] in communist
[3:02:56] countries a little flock is always the
[3:03:00] first to be examinated though actually
[3:03:05] insignificant in size
[3:03:07] the other questions are fine lawyer
[3:03:08] people who do only good they will always
[3:03:11] be persecuted to the end
[3:03:13] that they might be physically destroyed
[3:03:16] right now they have opened up everything
[3:03:19] but the churches
[3:03:22] and someone was telling me come to think
[3:03:24] of it
[3:03:25] is it that because the churches are bad
[3:03:27] or that the churches they
[3:03:29] will will spread the coroner very fast
[3:03:32] yet in in the people who go to churches
[3:03:35] are more disciplined than the ones who
[3:03:37] are going to the market
[3:03:38] but they kind of feel that our churches
[3:03:40] should be closed
[3:03:42] you see it's always a target group
[3:03:44] anyhow
[3:03:45] the reason this is so is because they
[3:03:47] are a rebuke to the god the godless
[3:03:50] like i saw thumb they stand out before
[3:03:52] the wicked
[3:03:54] and though the writers intend no harm to
[3:03:57] the wicked but want to do all the good
[3:03:59] invariably they find that they are
[3:04:01] embroiled as was john the baptist with
[3:04:04] herod for john did not want to harm
[3:04:07] either herod or his wife but to save
[3:04:10] them from his rock from the wrath of god
[3:04:13] this was not only thoroughly
[3:04:15] misunderstood and absolutely with the
[3:04:17] stood but john was put to death because
[3:04:19] of which can imagine
[3:04:21] and for all the good the people of god
[3:04:23] do they are still put to public shame
[3:04:25] unto death can you imagine
[3:04:27] [Music]
[3:04:28] so please this is what we know always
[3:04:30] happens
[3:04:32] so to believe jesus doesn't come without
[3:04:33] a price
[3:04:34] surely there must be some sinister force
[3:04:37] behind a people who would be so void of
[3:04:40] conscience that they would return evil
[3:04:43] to those who did them good yes there's
[3:04:45] such a force it is
[3:04:48] saturn the answer lies in the next verse
[3:04:52] which is revelation 10 which says for
[3:04:54] none of those things which thou shalt
[3:04:56] suffer
[3:04:58] behold the devil shall cast some of you
[3:05:01] that fear none of those things the devil
[3:05:02] shall cast some of you in prison that he
[3:05:05] may be tried
[3:05:06] and
[3:05:07] he shall have tribulation ten days
[3:05:10] be thy faithful unto death and i'll give
[3:05:12] thee a crown
[3:05:14] of life and we'll start from there
[3:05:17] next tuesday
[3:05:21] my my god bless you
[3:05:23] and uh there's quite much quite much
[3:05:26] quite much for us to cover
[3:05:27] i'm sure that
[3:05:29] you will continually be blessed as we
[3:05:31] cover this
[3:05:33] amen just continue piling little by
[3:05:35] little by little soon you realize it's
[3:05:38] quite much in your heart
