Uh this evening I have a a small text that I want us to share and I will call it sorry I call it uh I refuse to back down. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; I don't know how it is on your side. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. I'm sorry that I refuse to back down. And that should be our confession tonight. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And if you go back to the scripture we have just read, &gt;&gt; he said that it shall come to pass. Amen. If thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to do all his commandments, which I command thee this day, that the Lord thy God will set thee on high. Amen. Praise be to God above all nations. This is the Lord giving the promise. If we shall obey, if we shall hearken unto the Lord our God, &gt;&gt; blessed be the name of the Lord and hearken unto him. Praise be to God. The Lord gave us his word. He gave us his promise. Praise be to God. I've never read anywhere where we are encouraged to back down. &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. BUT EVERY SINGLE SCRIPTURE we read, the Lord encourages us. He tells US TO FEAR NOT. HE TELLS US to press on. Amen. So we don't have any other excuse. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And tonight that ought to be our confession. No matter what is happening around, I know the year is ending. All of us when the beginning, we had a list of things we blessed before the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. And now since you're approaching the end of the year, there are many voices speaking to us. And you find these voices. Most of them, they are negative voices. Trying to discourage us. Praise be TO GOD. BUT TONIGHT, I WANT you to look unto the Lord. Let us look at WHAT GOD HAS DONE FOR US. BLESSED BE THE NAME OF the Lord because that's what he promised us. He told us to look unto Jesus who is our who is the author. Amen. THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA OF our faith. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Amen. I remember one time a pastor preached a message. No retreat, no surrender. Praise be to God. We are not ready to retreat. We are not ready to step down. We are not ready to give up. Praise be to God. Amen. But we ARE HERE TO FIGHT EVERY DAY, FIGHTING the Lord's battle, PRESSING ON TO THE MARK OF high calling. Praise be to God. Amen. And we are not going to retreat. We are marching on. Blessed be the name of the Lord. The Lord gave us a promise. He never say that our enemy will not attack us. He say THEY WILL COME AND THEY COMING ONE WAY. PRAISE BE to God. BUT GUESS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? He will strike them and they will scatter in seven. Praise be to God. When God called Israel out of Egypt, he only mentioned the promised land and that was the main main reason why he called them. He was taking them TO THE PROMISED LAND BECAUSE GOD had given Abraham a promise. Praise be to God. God knew that the Red Sea WAS THERE. HE knew that the challenges are on the way. Praise be TO GOD. BUT THEIR INTENTION, they are supposed to believe the word of God. BECAUSE WHEN GOD SPEAKS, WHEN GOD CALLS US, AMEN. It is him who called us. It is his calling. He's the one leading the way. PRAISE BE TO GOD. THIS other business alongside the way. That is God's business. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember the prophet preached the message third exodus. Jesus said as it was in HIS FIRST COMING SHALL it be in his second coming just the way they had challenges in their first excuse the same things. Hallelujah. WE ARE GOING TO FACE them in this excerpt. Praise be to God. But remember there are key people in that exodus that is Joshua and Caleb who knew their promise who were not willing to see it. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. Amen. Who were updated with the message of their day. There's no we are not WE ARE GOING TO KNOW THE TIME WE are living in without recognizing the message of our day. The message of OUR DAY IS WHAT'S POINTING US TO THE promises of God. Amen. THAT'S WHAT IS SHOWING US THE DAYS WE ARE LIVING IN. How close we ARE TO THE COMING OF THE LORD. MANY TIME WE ARE not we are not in fire for God because we have forgotten about the days we are living in. Praise be to God. We are THE PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO BE ON FIRE FOR God because we KNOW THAT THE BRIDE HAS A MINISTRY. Praise be to God. way. &gt;&gt; But many time we we back down things nowadays. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. But there are men and women WHO ARE LIKE THE OTHER bunch whom Paul met who are serving unknown god. You find them on prayer mountain in the bushes. praying, seeking God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the bride in THIS GENERATION, WE KNOW WHERE GOD HAS CHOSEN PLACE OF WORSHIP IS. AMEN. BUT MANY TIME WE FORGET. BUT I PERSONALLY LIKE JOSHUA OF ALL S AND MY HOUSE, WE SHALL SERVE THE LORD. PRAISE BE TO GOD. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU tonight that you also choose ye this day. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I would have say that we refuse to surrender or to back down. That's why I would have said we refuse to back down to surrender to step down to go back. But I said I so it's up to you. Amen. We have not GOT TO HAVE OUR MIND MADE UP. We have not got to have our mind make made up like to made up our mind. But let us decide IN OUR HEART PRAISE BE TO GOD. AMEN. IT IS OUR HEARTS THAT SERVE GOD, &gt;&gt; NOT OUR MIND. &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. AMEN. BUT WE SERVE GOD WITH OUR HEART. PRAISE BE TO GOD. SO THAT'S WHY TONIGHT, LET US MAKE UP OUR MIND. LET US TELL THE DEVIL THAT TODAY I CHOSE [screaming] NOT TO STEP BACK. AMEN. NO MATTER WHAT IS COMING OUR WAY, WE ARE MOVING FORWARD. BECAUSE IN OUR DNA, HALLELUJAH. In the MIND OF GOD, BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, HALLELUJAH, GOD SAW US MAKING IT. HE SAW US GOING THROUGH TODAY. AND THAT IS WHO WE ARE. THAT IS WHAT identified us. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Even our LORD JESUS CHRIST WHEN HE WAS CARRYING THE CROSS, HE REACHED A CERTAIN POINT AND HE WAS FALLING with the cross. Blessed be the name of the Lord. WHEN SIMON THE SER CAME JESUS, Jesus never told him now have the cross. He would have said but since you have come now carry the cross. Praise be to God. But no matter what happened, Jesus was giving us an example. HE WAS CARRYING IT, FALLING DOWN AND RISING UP. THAT IS OUR CHRISTIAN JOURNEY, OUR CHRISTIAN WALK. HALLELUJAH. THINGS WILL NOT BE OKAY ALL THE TIME. BUT THE GOD OF THE MOUNTAIN IS THE GOD OF THE VALLEY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE GOD OF THE SEA IS THE GOD [screaming] OF THE LAND. THE GOD OF THE STORM IS THE GOD OF STABILITY. HE IS STILL THE SAME GOD. AS LONG AS OUR ANCHOR, &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; He never gave up. &gt;&gt; But Jesus continued, "Blessed be the name of the Lord, EVEN UP TO THE LAST MOMENT. You have no reason for giving up. I don't care how broke you are, HOW SICKLY YOU ARE, HOW YOU HOW MANY YEARS YOU SPEND IN THAT SITUATION? Blessed be the name of the Lord. YOU HAVE NO REASON to give up. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHETS OF ALL THEY GAVE PROPHECY. AND THIS PROPHECY CAME TO PASS EVEN WHEN MAJORITY HAD DIED. BUT THEY DIED BELIEVING THAT IT WILL COME TO PASS. BLESSED be the NAME OF THE LORD. HALLELUJAH. The gospel HAS BEEN PREACHED FOR 2,000 YEARS. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. They started preaching when they were young. and they grew UP AND 30 YEARS WENT BY, 40 YEARS, 50 YEARS. You go in the middle and you see GRAY HAIR COMING. THEY NEVER GAVE UP. &gt;&gt; THEY KEPT ON BELIEVING. AMEN. THEY REFUSED TO BACK DOWN BECAUSE THE LORD HAD SPOKEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We have no reason. &gt;&gt; We all go through certain situations. &gt;&gt; There are times when you find yourself on the wall. Amen. But a prophet tells that there is no man that has ever had any situation like that of Jonah. Jonah was in the belly OF THE TIME. HE WOULD TOUCH HE WOULD TOUCH VOMIT. HE WOULD TOUCH. HE WOULD TOUCH ROTTEN THINGS. BUT HE REFUSED TO GIVE UP. HE REMEMBERED THE PROMISE of God. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you who doesn't read the word, &gt;&gt; what will he remember? He who doesn't listen to the message, &gt;&gt; where is your anchor? Praise be to God. When he was in that situation, he never remembered Romeo and Julius. He never remember this other novels. If you shall if you shall harken diligent the voice of the Lord thy God, not only that to observe and do all his commandments which I command thee this day. Blessed be the name of the Lord. The Lord shall cause my enemies. Amen. He shall cause MY ENEMIES. ALL THE years we have been on earth is what God has always been doing. WHEN WE ARE SAVED BY OUR enemy and YOU CRY UNTO GOD, HE COMES DOWN and make a way. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Praise be to God. WE HAVE COME TOO FAR TO LOOK BACK.

BUT ONE THING I KNOW, THE BIBLE TELLS ME THAT THE LORD HE HAS MAGNIFIED HIS WORD. AT THE NAME OF JESUS, EVERY KNEE PASS, EVERY TONGUE CONFESS THAT JESUS IS LORD IF AT THE NAME OF JESUS. But he SAYS IN SOME HE HAS MAGNIFIED HIS WORD ABOVE [screaming] HIS NAME. WHEN THE WORD OF GOD IS PREACHED, IS BEING PREACHED, THERE IS NO DEMON AS MANDATE OVER YOU.

This is the TIME FOR YOU AND ME TO GO BACK AND RECLAIM YOUR GROUND. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let the Lord come. David say, "Lay the Lord arise and his enemies." When Jesus rose on the Amen, the storms were peace be still. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the sea obeyed. That same Jesus is speaking tonight. Bless Jesus speaking his word.

He said that in last days power must be upon all sons and daughters vision all men with dreams and upon my handmade they shall prophesy. Amen. AMEN. BROTHER, SISTER, THAT IS OUR PROMISE. and the same word you cannot go back to God because the Lord promised you he will fulfill it. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have no reason to retreat back.

Everything you're just forced to do. Other sing I am bound for the promise. Others are singing and even when you look at them body language telling that they bound to the promised land. Praise be to God. DO YOU KNOW WHY THEY ARE LIKE THAT? IT'S BECAUSE THEY THEOPHONY BOUND ALREADY THERE. THEN YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER GROUP. There is something wrong somewhere. Give the LORD A BIGGER HAND CLAP. For you that is the bigger hand clap. But to those when he reach down [screaming] for me and he reach DOWN HIS SON FOR ME. I WAS LOST [screaming] AND UNTOUCHED without God. Then he reached for me. You find them in tears. She remember when she was in the world. Maybe she was in witchcraft. Maybe she had no consciousness. MAYBE WAS IN THE PROSTITUTE HOUSE. ONE DAY AN EVANGELIST PREACHED THE ONCOMING STORM AND SHE RECEIVED the word. Oh, he received the world. Amen. Amen. And then the Lord pulled him over. So when the song sings such a flashback, AMEN. AMEN. AND SHE'S WHERE SHE WAS. Those are the people you find who are worshiping God since because indeed they were lost and undone, brother, sister, no man could buy our salvation. Praise be to God. Let me read a scripture here.

Maybe it is a forget day. I'm seeing mirage on my way. But one thing I'm sure of the pillar of fire is leading the way. That pillar of fire is leading THE WAY. I DON'T NEED TO SEE IT WITH MY FINGER. I DON'T NEED TO TOUCH IT. I DON'T NEED TO FEEL IT. BUT I NEED TO BELIEVE that he is leading THE WAY. BECAUSE THE BIBLE TELLS US WHOEVER COMES TO GOD MUST RECEIVE that reward. PRAISE BE TO GOD. SOMETIME I tell God I am not a diligent seeker. I AM TRYING EITHER WAY. Even in this weakness, Lord, I'm trying. I am believing that you are. PRAISE BE TO GOD.

RECOGNIZE YOUR POSITION. AMEN. THE DEVIL WILL NOT BE OUR MATCH. BECAUSE THE DEVIL TO DEFEAT US HE HAS TO FIRST GO IN THE MIND OF God because our plan of defeat, our plan of victory was planned WAY BACK IN THE MIND OF GOD of our victory. Way back in the mind of God. And in that ROOM WHERE GOD SAT WITH HIS ATTRIBUTE BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, THAT'S WHERE THE PLAN WAS MADE. THE DEVIL WAS not there. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THE DEVIL WAS NOT THERE IN THAT PLAN. PRAISE BE TO GOD. I CHOSE &gt;&gt; NOT to back down. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; MANY TIME WE want to fast feel. I feel like I don't have faith. He never told us to feel faith. He told us to believe. Amen. Amen. I feel like not praying. He never told you to feel like praying. He told you to pray. I don't feel like reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; You don't need to feel like reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; You have to read and pray that read the Bible and pray every day. AMEN. [screaming] AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE SAID THAT LET US PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOR of God. Put on your armor. There's no time to waste, brother. PRAISE BE TO GOD. AND I'M TELLING YOU, IF YOU ARE DOUBTING YOURSELF, you are going to make it in the rapture blood. &gt;&gt; Yes. If you are not, I will make it. Because he said so. He promised, I'm going to pray your place. Where I am, you come and be there. In my father's place, I'm a man. He never said that when I said for only brother. He never say I say that for brother so I'm going to make you. You see how gracious our GOD IS. IT'S UP TO you to put that you there. And when I READ THE SCRIPTURE I READ IT THIS WAY. I'M GOING TO HE'S going to make for me. Praise be to God. That's where we are going. We don't have time to waste here. Let us do our duties here, but knowing that we are going somewhere. I know we're living in a time when things are not like they used to be. But the Bible tells us Jesus Christ is the same yesterday is the same today in the same form. He will never change. His provision will NEVER CHANGE. HIS GLORY WILL NEVER CHANGE. AMEN. AMEN. THAT GOD WILL NEVER CHANGE. IS THE SAME ALPHA THE SAME JOHN SAY I AM ALPHA &gt;&gt; AND I'M OMEGA I'M THE BEGINNING I'M THE ENDING THE ONE WHO WAS DEAD AND I AM ALIVE THAT [screaming] SAME JESUS &gt;&gt; IS MOVING THE SEVEN CANDLES AMEN THE SAME GOD OPEN THE EYES THE SAME GOD WHO HEAL CANCER. The same God WHO HEAL THE SICK. THAT SAME GOD IS HERE. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] AMEN. WHO MADE THE DEMON OF GADA. A MAN WHO HAD MORE THAN 2,000 DEMONS. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that Jesus never wrestled with a man of God. That's what I told you that God is presence alone, demons will faint for. Praise be to God. And that's why THE DEVIL FIGHTS SO HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ATMOSPHERE AROUND YOU is weird atmosphere. You listen to King of your heart things like that. That's what the devil want because there you are going to bleach your hedge. He want to get access over you and from there he will show you that pastor has been preaching these sermons. Brother Luang and all other ministers but it's not working for you because your head is bleached. Praise be to God. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Your fortress has been bleached. &gt;&gt; That the enemy made a hole and entered into your fortress. Praise be to God. That's why you have clear atmosphere. You feel very weak all the time. You just get up. You just speak words and even wonder. has not changed brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. I always say that before rapture COMES I WILL HAVE TO overcome every demon and even step my leg on his their heads. We are not just running for a narrow escape to the rapture that we are counting each day. If the day comes to an end, we say, "Oh my God, &gt;&gt; NO SIR, GET YOUR BIBLE &gt;&gt; AND GO READ WHERE THE Bible says, WE SHALL LAY OUR HANDS ON THE SICK AND THEY SHALL RECOVER. WE SHALL CAST OUT DEMONS IN HIS NAME." YOU HAVE NOT EVEN CAST THE devil and you are running away. You are obscing from your duty. You've not even visited even the nearby clinic to go see whether they are the sick. It is a promise here. Oh, let rapture come. BROTHER, SISTER. AMEN. WE are here TO STEP ON THE DEVIL'S HEAD. [cheering] [applause] You have no reason to step down. Praise be to God. The Bible tells us, "Hidden things belong to the Lord, but those which are revealed, they are ours and for our children. Brother, these things is revealed to us and this is our heritage. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of &gt;&gt; shall we rise on our feet? &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; I'll just end with this after the Israelite crossed the Red Seas. Praise the Lord. And sister Miriam looked back and saw their oppressor. How are they drowning in the sea? Their task masters who had BEATEN THEM FOR SO MANY YEARS, their commanders drowning. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. They never had reason to. back down. The Bible say that she got her tongue and she le of Israel and they danced. Praise be to God. The reason as why many times you feel like you you feel like not even clapping or singing. It's because you're still under your task. And then you're going to shout amen. Uh as you're going to shout, you look back now. I'm waiting for you. You shout I'm waiting for you outside physical type spiritual sometime when my son is disorganizing when causing case where I sitting I just looked at him like this. and he knows what will follow. So when you're still under the devil's yoke when you WANT TO SAY AMEN THEN REMEMBER what what so I'm so say when you want to clap your hands I said but my hands are it will pain me you look at your task masters because they are still praise be to Amen. &gt;&gt; But when YOU SEE BROTHER BRIAN JUMPING AND dancing shout when he looks BACK HE SEES THE taskmasters drowning. That is the difference. PRAISE BE TO GOD. NOT WITH MARIAM. OH GOD, LET ME BE LIKE HER. BUT WHEN I SEE MY TASK MASTER, I will rejoice in the Lord. I WILL DANCE LIKE DAVID.

There is your there is your name tacked on on the box. Your name is just written on the box and and you're being told these are yours. Are they? In one sense they are yours because your name is on it. In another sense they are not. Now you say I don't want them. Well he will say they are yours. Your name is on them. Well that's one way it is yours because your name is on it. but it isn't yours till you sign for it. And if you don't sign for it, you will have to take it back. &gt;&gt; You might see all your symptoms. The devil says, "Here it is. You here is your cancer. Here is your heart trouble. Here is your crippled condition. Here is your sickness. HERE IS YOUR POVERTY. HERE is your this. Here is your that." And our prophet says, "Refuse to sign for anything the devil brings." [screaming] Amen. He will have to take it back. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "I REFUSE TO SIGN FOR IT. I REFUSE TO HAVE IT. I JUST WON'T HAVE IT." NO, SIR. He will have to take it back.

[music] I refuse to be immoral. You refuse your problem. [cheering] Amen. I just won't take it. He will have to take it back in the name of the Lord. If you believe it and you confess it and say, "I've accepted Jesus as my healer." THERE IS NO AFFLICTION OR DISEASE CAN STAY ON YOU. [music] STAY RIGHT with him. Amen. Hallelujah. But the first time you say, "Well, Mr. Devil, I will have it back." Oh, brother. You stand right there. As long as you breathe in your body, say, "I refuse to have it. I refuse to have it." &gt;&gt; How do you How are you feeling? You say, "Wonderful." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; EVEN IF YOU'RE FEELING BAD, SAY, "I'M FEELING WONDERFUL. YOU SHOW, LISTEN, he says, you show the devil WHAT YOU ARE MADE OUT OF. [screaming] You are born again by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; And you DON'T HAVE TO BOW DOWN TO HIS IMAGES. &gt;&gt; YOU STAY RIGHT THERE. AND I AND YOU SAY, "I DON'T WANT YOUR [screaming] STUFF, DEVIL." AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, I don't know. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I know that each of us, the devil, many times brings us packages with our names on it. &gt;&gt; We have to learn to refuse those packages. &gt;&gt; Whatever your trouble is, &gt;&gt; the problem you are going through is a package from the devil with your name on it. &gt;&gt; But you have to learn to refuse it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if YOU REFUSE TO SIGN FOR IT, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT. &gt;&gt; THE BRINGER WILL HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK. [music] I REFUSE TO TURN BACK. I [screaming] REFUSE TO BACK DOWN. AMEN. I REFUSE TO BE LUKEWARM. I REFUSE TO BE CALLED. AMEN. I refuse to be sick. I refuse TO BE A SINNER. COME ON, CHURCH. I'M A CHRISTIAN OR I'M A BORN AGAIN CHILD OF GOD. [music] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Come on, GIVE THE LORD SOME praise tonight. Glory, glory, glory. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Amen. Glory to your name, Lord. You know what? I'll tell you a testimony right here, brother Polycup. You know, sometimes you do not know what the word does in you until until you are in a in a squeeze, in pressure. This morning, he just called me. He was the first person. He said, "Pastor, I want to talk to you. I have a I said, "Well, what is it?" He said, "Um, [music] I have a testimony to share with you." And then he begins to tell me the testimony. There's this friend of his, he's the only black fellow in the school where they are, in the university where they are in Pakistan. He came from a country called Togo. And so this young man is uh younger than he is and but you know they they go to the same class. And so he he came to him he was having a lot of uh stomach trouble and he was squeezing his stomach and he was he you know he he he made his way into his dometry. And he said please pray rather he said take me to the hospital try to help me. And you know he looked around all his friends the Pakistanis that he lives with were out of the dometry and he he never knew where our hospital was. He did not know what to do for his friend. And so he was there confused. But he remembered in that moment he remembered he has a God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, glory to God. And you know what he told him? You know what? Let me pray for you. So he laid his hands on on that f friend of his and he prayed for him in the name of the Lord. He rebuked that sickness and the young man was instantly healed. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] And Polyap told me, he said he thought maybe the [music] young man was not sick, but you know when the young man left, he sent him a testimony and it was a long testimony. He read it for me. I I don't have a copy of it, but he said it. He read it for me. And and that boy was so touched and he said he now from that moment on, he will never [music] doubt that God is real. He's not even a message believer yet, but I can assure you he will receive the message because he has tested the God of the messages alive. &gt;&gt; Amen.
