[23:38] before we see the first stanza again
[23:40] you know i'd like to share something
[23:41] with you
[23:43] if indeed
[23:45] you have traveled for a long time
[23:48] down on a road that probably was lonely
[23:51] in your life
[23:53] without somebody to comfort you without
[23:55] jesus who would be your comfort
[23:58] that your heart was heavy you sat you
[24:01] sunk low in sin
[24:03] and then if you need it is through your
[24:05] heart of jesus you heard of this message
[24:08] if indeed it is true these things happen
[24:10] to you
[24:11] i'm talking to you
[24:13] each of you that is here
[24:16] you cannot sing it the way you're seeing
[24:19] it
[24:21] if indeed these things are true
[24:24] even if you are hearing this song for
[24:26] your first time
[24:27] you can't sing it the way you're singing
[24:29] something is definitely wrong
[24:33] i'm in a room which seems as if
[24:36] we have old people here
[24:38] this is a room of young people
[24:40] you're all young
[24:42] all of you are young and strong and

[26:05] hands together like this
[26:08] as if you are someone who is tired and
[26:10] shackled
[26:11] let me tell you god cannot work in your
[26:13] life if you remain bound
[26:16] those things that are binding your life
[26:17] and putting you down it can't go if you
[26:20] remain bound

[26:25] when the crowd moves when the kind of
[26:26] glory moves what do you do brother

[26:50] it is good that if there is a sinner
[26:52] among us or sinners let them come god
[26:55] loves them
[26:57] then
[26:58] you can deliver
[26:59] you can one can usually deliver
[27:01] everybody who is bound in this place

[27:04] yourself there is no freedom anywhere

[45:11] just stay
[45:12] in the chat
[45:14] because you can't see
[45:15] what i'm saying a sound is distorted
[45:18] because of your connection
[45:20] i don't know why these days your
[45:22] connection is not good so
[45:24] you need to
[45:27] let me mute you here
[45:28] you need to simply chat
[45:31] send a text on the chat there
[45:34] let me know which chapter you are on
[45:36] by the time
[45:37] you started we started asking people to
[45:40] read
[45:41] so we can know whether you qualify or
[45:43] not and also i have more questions for
[45:44] those who say that they completed okay
[45:46] apart from her and sister sarah and
[45:49] brother who else
[45:58] west you
[46:01] which chapter were you on
[46:05] huh
[46:08] who's raising the hand
[46:11] oh sister peace
[46:14] it's a beast
[46:16] which sister peace is this one
[46:20] ranum
[46:24] oh
[46:25] but
[46:26] what did she know what we're talking
[46:28] about at that time was she in the
[46:30] meeting
[46:32] mr peace you need to type also and let
[46:34] me know which chapter you are on when i
[46:35] ask people to finish
[46:37] uh
[46:38] i see that
[46:42] john says she was in chapter six
[46:48] so
[46:49] chapter six we are now on chapter four
[46:51] right
[46:53] so if it is chapter six that must have
[46:56] been the
[47:00] 31 church age
[47:02] so she reads saturn sadis philadelphia
[47:06] rhodesia and the regime of ages
[47:09] so how long did that take you sister
[47:11] john can you please send him into the
[47:13] chat and say how long it took you to
[47:14] read those four chapters
[47:17] and then also just a piece let us know
[47:18] okay who else brother brother solomon
[47:21] how long did it take you
[47:27] from which chapter
[47:31] uh chapter five
[47:34] okay so you were in the fragrance
[47:35] strategy do you understand what you were
[47:37] reading
[47:39] so what did you read in the other four
[47:40] pages
[47:46] in the 4a yeah no the one after
[47:50] what did you read that you you can tell
[47:52] these people that they should really
[47:55] ah i see sister john you say it took you
[47:57] four days okay
[47:59] that's good
[48:00] uh so you took a day for each chapter
[48:04] that sounds pretty possible
[48:07] a day for each chapter
[48:09] so that's a standard a very good
[48:10] standard
[48:11] huh
[48:13] brother you don't know what you read
[48:16] you're checking again so which means you
[48:18] never understood but just straight
[48:19] through
[48:22] you made your notes that's very good who
[48:24] else
[48:27] okay so only two people
[48:29] brother
[48:30] solomon
[48:32] sister joanne
[48:34] and sister peace
[48:36] is that peace i think you will have to
[48:39] invite her on one of our
[48:40] physical meetings here
[48:42] so you can come for a price
[48:45] right
[48:46] just a piece you have to come for your
[48:47] prize
[48:49] and then the others are also going to
[48:51] get theirs
[48:52] hallelujah
[48:54] you you want me you want to see it when
[48:56] i'm giving to them
[48:57] okay that's fine
[48:59] i can then prepare each one of our
[49:01] meetings
[49:02] and they will receive it
[49:04] with two hands
[49:05] hallelujah
[49:08] then i i see sister pieces saying she
[49:10] was on chapter seven
[49:12] uh she was on chapter seven
[49:14] so that means how long did it take you
[49:16] to read the remaining chapters the
[49:19] remaining three chapters
[49:24] uh
[49:25] peace you need to answer those questions
[49:27] do not first know whether you qualify or
[49:30] not
[49:30] all right
[49:32] i think we are now set to continue as
[49:34] she took her one week okay she's a slow
[49:36] reader
[49:37] but uh three chapters took her one week
[49:40] how many days seven days
[49:43] hmm and you people you have not
[49:45] completed even in those days
[49:48] so the question is what is wrong
[49:53] i think among all of us here locus is
[49:56] the most busy
[49:59] even those of you are working in the
[50:00] office you don't work her
[50:02] okay the work you want you're working
[50:04] with more left you know smaller more
[50:06] tasking on the body but it doesn't take
[50:08] a long time like
[50:10] the one she does you know but
[50:13] how far be ready
[50:16] chapter five which chapter were you on
[50:18] them
[50:23] by the time i told people to read
[50:31] okay let's do this whoever is on chapter
[50:35] five and below
[50:37] you are not serious
[50:40] why
[50:41] our standard is this is about us now for
[50:43] those who are very very slow

[56:50] yeah you see it is good it is a
[56:52] sacrifice
[56:54] yeah but i might call it a sacrifice
[56:57] have you ever seen you know i watched
[56:59] one day i watched a video there was a
[57:01] small boy very very small
[57:03] listen to the story please and he was
[57:06] cutting he was carrying firewood big you
[57:08] know he was carrying some firewood from
[57:11] a timber team it was timber it was
[57:13] firewood from one place to the house
[57:16] and i'm not doing this
[57:20] so as he was carrying as he was carrying
[57:23] you know he would fall down and then it
[57:25] would appear sure he cannot pass here
[57:26] he's a small boy the thing is big but he
[57:29] will get up again and carry and fall
[57:31] down again and carry and forward and
[57:33] again and carry until he reaches the
[57:35] house
[57:36] after falling and crying and falling and
[57:38] crying sometimes he would fall and even
[57:40] the legs would go up he would come back
[57:42] again and carry while crying
[57:44] i call that great
[57:48] preach
[57:52] but did the boy take the dream by all
[57:55] the wood in the house
[57:56] did they deliver it
[57:58] did he not suffer
[58:00] that is called sacrifice
[58:01] it's called greed it's called not giving
[58:04] god brother don't discourage these
[58:05] people saying that they're not
[58:06] understanding someone has told me that
[58:08] three times the first time
[58:10] he was just reading through the second
[58:11] time he was trying to understand and
[58:14] let's do it like that
[58:16] like you remember we used to do a
[58:18] summaries
[58:20] simply because you can't do something it
[58:22] doesn't mean that someone else cannot
[58:24] and you too can do it if you really want
[58:26] to
[58:27] all who say that well i can't you you're
[58:30] really kind how many hours you sleep
[58:33] some of you being as mature as you are
[58:35] still sleep for 10 hours
[58:37] even more than 10 hours
[58:41] the longest i sleep myself is six hours
[58:43] these days
[58:44] because there's so much to do
[58:46] but you guys will sleep maybe 10 hours
[58:49] in the night and again you add you drop
[58:51] up
[58:52] two to three hours during the daytime
[58:54] because i'm i mean lock down not reading
[58:55] books
[58:56] and then you are saying i didn't have
[58:58] enough time please read
[59:00] read
[59:01] so you can be able to get something for
[59:03] your heart for your soul
[59:05] amen
[59:06] all right we have now taken one hour
[59:09] already of our time
[59:11] and i know it is not in vain
[59:14] that was also very important
[59:16] now here is what we are going to do
[59:19] because of the interest of time since
[59:21] that joanne has typed here what she was
[59:23] reading that people don't know nothing
[59:24] about
[59:25] about the twelve tribes of the sons of
[59:27] jackal
[59:31] do you know about it brother
[59:42] so you know them
[59:48] [Music]
[59:55] uh
[1:00:06] and what does it mean my brother we are
[1:00:08] speaking mysteries
[1:00:17] is
[1:00:52] it comes
[1:00:53] in seven different
[1:00:57] different
[1:00:59] periods
[1:01:00] but it's one spirit
[1:01:04] so the seven spirits are the
[1:01:06] him
[1:01:07] but now in different
[1:01:16] now some of you are wondering what is he
[1:01:18] talking about
[1:01:19] because he has ahead of you
[1:01:22] huh yes
[1:01:23] you just pray her that we get even there
[1:01:25] by the time you look down this down
[1:01:28] before you go back to studying your
[1:01:30] moral shoes and stuff like that
[1:01:33] uh so by the shave now you can agree
[1:01:35] that he has the manners ahead of me
[1:01:43] can you give him credit
[1:01:47] but you can your friends
[1:02:03] was the best known messenger of all ages
[1:02:05] we don't know whether she read that but
[1:02:07] we'll get to that all right
[1:02:09] now
[1:02:10] um
[1:02:11] i'd like us to
[1:02:13] today the way i'm going to do it i'm
[1:02:16] going to let brother
[1:02:20] brother our brothers and brother read
[1:02:21] for us
[1:02:23] as we are listening
[1:02:25] when you have something you want to ask
[1:02:26] about
[1:02:27] you you stop him or you you you raise up
[1:02:30] your hand
[1:02:31] and then we shall be able to uh pause
[1:02:35] and explain a bit if there's something
[1:02:36] i'd like to explain we'll as well do
[1:02:38] that
[1:02:42] can you put the screen so that people
[1:02:44] can follow or you can as well fall in
[1:02:47] your book for the new book
[1:03:04] why did we stop
[1:03:13] right here
[1:03:16] animal life and it could not come back
[1:03:18] upon the sinner making him clean
[1:03:23] revelation 2 10
[1:03:26] fear none of those things which thou
[1:03:28] shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast
[1:03:31] some of you into prison that you may be
[1:03:33] tried and you shall have tribulation ten
[1:03:36] days
[1:03:37] be thou faithful unto death
[1:03:39] and i will give thee a crown of life
[1:03:42] every time the lord uses those words
[1:03:44] fear not there is an engagement at hand
[1:03:47] which will involve great danger and
[1:03:49] suffering and deprivation
[1:03:51] now he does not say in a blonde curt
[1:03:53] manner
[1:03:54] tribulation is coming that would
[1:03:56] frighten one
[1:03:57] but like a mother who was about to turn
[1:03:59] out the light says gently to her child
[1:04:01] lest he be frightened now don't be
[1:04:03] afraid for the light will go out and it
[1:04:05] will be dark
[1:04:07] but remember that i am here with you
[1:04:09] so he says
[1:04:11] don't be afraid of man or what he can do
[1:04:13] to you i am with you and my grace is
[1:04:15] sufficient for you
[1:04:17] when you pass through the waters they
[1:04:19] will not overflow you not even in death
[1:04:21] are you defeated
[1:04:22] you are more than conquerors
[1:04:26] the greater part
[1:04:28] did you hear that
[1:04:29] not even what
[1:04:32] we sing a song lord even in death
[1:04:36] he
[1:04:38] is
[1:04:47] [Music]
[1:04:52] [Music]
[1:05:05] oh
[1:05:06] even death
[1:05:09] could not
[1:05:11] conquer him
[1:05:14] even in the grave
[1:05:18] he's the
[1:05:20] law
[1:05:32] [Music]
[1:05:32] [Applause]
[1:05:34] even in
[1:05:36] [Music]
[1:05:43] [Music]
[1:05:49] [Music]
[1:05:57] [Music]
[1:06:07] you see you say even death
[1:06:10] could not defeat you
[1:06:14] you are more than conquerors
[1:06:17] that doesn't mean that death won't come
[1:06:19] it doesn't also mean problems won't come
[1:06:22] you are christian you must always know
[1:06:24] that you are more than a conqueror why
[1:06:27] because jesus conquered everything you
[1:06:29] go through you're going to suffer many
[1:06:30] many things as a christian
[1:06:33] this manner teaches us
[1:06:35] in this chapter we learn many many
[1:06:36] things about suffering
[1:06:39] that
[1:06:40] suffering because of who you are
[1:06:43] will
[1:06:44] be
[1:06:45] a necessity
[1:06:46] for you
[1:06:47] to
[1:06:48] attain correct
[1:06:51] healing
[1:06:52] and so it will come
[1:06:54] let us proceed would we have a problem
[1:06:57] with that
[1:07:01] what is happening
[1:07:04] okay well you have books follow
[1:07:06] following your books as brothers are
[1:07:07] trying to
[1:07:08] put it up so paul knew from experience
[1:07:11] the reality of those words and he wrote
[1:07:13] in romans 8 35-59
[1:07:16] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:07:18] christ
[1:07:20] shall tribulation or distress or
[1:07:22] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:07:25] peril or sword
[1:07:27] as it is written
[1:07:28] for thy sake we are killed all the day
[1:07:30] long we are accounted as sheep for the
[1:07:33] slaughter
[1:07:34] may in all these things we are more than
[1:07:36] conquerors through him that loved us
[1:07:38] for i am persuaded that neither death
[1:07:41] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[1:07:44] nor powers nor things present nor things
[1:07:47] to come nor height nor depth nor any
[1:07:50] other creature shall be able to separate
[1:07:52] us from the love of god
[1:07:54] which is in christ jesus our lord
[1:07:57] no we are not to fear
[1:07:59] his love casts out all fear
[1:08:02] now notice what he says
[1:08:05] the devil will cast some of you into
[1:08:06] prison that you may be tried
[1:08:09] the jews were doing that right then
[1:08:11] the pagan priests were doing that right
[1:08:13] then
[1:08:14] the governors who tried to curry favor
[1:08:16] with the public because the people liked
[1:08:18] the arena hurled the christians by the
[1:08:20] thousands to their death destroying them
[1:08:22] by lions and gladiators
[1:08:24] what has the devil to do with this
[1:08:27] why blame him
[1:08:28] ah yes but it is the devil's hatred
[1:08:30] behind it all
[1:08:32] he is behind it all for he hates god
[1:08:35] what god has set his heart on satan is
[1:08:37] bound to try to destroy
[1:08:39] but watch
[1:08:40] here is some illumination
[1:08:42] if satan is behind the jews who are
[1:08:44] hailing the christians into court
[1:08:46] then the jews are not of god's religion
[1:08:48] but the devils
[1:08:50] their gathering is also of the synagogue
[1:08:52] of satan
[1:08:53] and if the roman catholic church killed
[1:08:55] the multitudes of believers in the dark
[1:08:57] ages yes and in all ages then they are
[1:09:00] of the devil and belong to satan also
[1:09:04] and if you think this is shocking
[1:09:06] now before we continue that part
[1:09:09] i would have you
[1:09:10] look at somebody up there
[1:09:13] where he says
[1:09:15] are you following please yes
[1:09:17] uh where he says that uh
[1:09:20] the devil is behind it all
[1:09:24] and at this time there was
[1:09:27] a time when christians
[1:09:29] for 10 years as we shall see down there
[1:09:32] they were persecuted they would be
[1:09:34] imagined women with children
[1:09:37] they would be thrown in in a
[1:09:39] an arena with women with uh
[1:09:42] who were pregnant they would be throwing
[1:09:44] an arena
[1:09:46] where
[1:09:46] lions would be ready to eat them up
[1:09:50] and they eat them
[1:09:51] they were using them just to spot on
[1:09:53] them to play again
[1:09:55] it was a game to make people happy and
[1:09:57] to
[1:09:58] you know relax their nerves
[1:10:01] the romans
[1:10:02] and so they did that and these romans
[1:10:04] were calling themselves jews
[1:10:07] by calling themselves jews they were
[1:10:08] trying to claim their originality to say
[1:10:11] they were the ones because you see
[1:10:13] christianity it's like it appears it
[1:10:15] came from the jews from the jewish
[1:10:17] culture
[1:10:18] so they said we are the jews we are
[1:10:20] we're the right jews
[1:10:22] in other words we are there by this time
[1:10:24] our denomination had not formed yet
[1:10:26] but it was imminent it was about to form
[1:10:28] it would form in the in the following
[1:10:31] age
[1:10:32] so we can now see
[1:10:34] that uh they were behind it and that it
[1:10:36] wasn't them those romans it was really
[1:10:38] the devil was behind he has believers
[1:10:41] let me tell you the devil hates you if
[1:10:42] you are a true believer
[1:10:44] he hates you he helps you
[1:10:47] and he will do all he can to bring you
[1:10:49] down he never plans for every true
[1:10:51] believer every day you don't know how
[1:10:53] many meetings sit in hell simply because
[1:10:55] of you
[1:10:57] so then if the devil is planning for you
[1:10:59] that way how much more do you think god
[1:11:01] is planning for you
[1:11:03] hallelujah but remember that these
[1:11:05] people were persecuted
[1:11:07] but god said i know he never
[1:11:10] he never let those things not happen but
[1:11:12] that didn't mean that god was not a
[1:11:14] miracle working god but at this time
[1:11:16] this was the anointing he was moving
[1:11:19] here which i began to say this at this
[1:11:21] time it was uh the
[1:11:24] ox anointing you know whereby it's a a
[1:11:27] beast of sacrifice a beast of burden
[1:11:30] they had a lot of body on their heart
[1:11:32] you know such persecution and suffering
[1:11:34] and
[1:11:35] you know they were being sacrificed like
[1:11:37] that and then they would be annoyed they
[1:11:38] would kill this woman because she has
[1:11:40] refused to be counter religion or
[1:11:41] whatever and they would bring another
[1:11:43] one also and the the other one would
[1:11:45] also be given a chance to recount but he
[1:11:47] would refuse but today the only choices
[1:11:50] you need to make is between christ and
[1:11:52] the world and if you are it's so hard oh
[1:11:55] i need my trousers if you're a god oh i
[1:11:58] need my lipstick oh i need these things
[1:12:00] okay go and take them and go to hell
[1:12:04] but if you
[1:12:05] love jesus you do not play with jesus
[1:12:07] and still go to that vomit you see you
[1:12:10] don't wallow in your vomit
[1:12:12] you leave it then come back to christ he
[1:12:15] will he he can't have you can't take him
[1:12:18] because if how would you stand on the
[1:12:20] day on that day in the rapture with such
[1:12:23] people who get their lives
[1:12:25] for these calls which same cause we are
[1:12:27] standing for also how can you stand with
[1:12:30] them when you in your generation you are
[1:12:32] not able to overcome those things which
[1:12:34] are before
[1:12:38] wait until the prophecy of revelation 13
[1:12:41] is fulfilled
[1:12:42] it is strikingly true that the united
[1:12:44] states of america is in that chapter the
[1:12:47] very number 13 is a symbol of this
[1:12:49] nation
[1:12:50] it started with thirteen colonies its
[1:12:53] flag has thirteen stars and thirteen
[1:12:55] stripes
[1:12:56] and there is her destiny in the
[1:12:58] thirteenth chapter
[1:12:59] in this image that is mentioned in this
[1:13:01] chapter will be found all the wickedness
[1:13:03] of the beast that was before it
[1:13:06] as the beast rose at the nicene council
[1:13:08] so the image will come out of the world
[1:13:10] council of churches with all ungodly and
[1:13:12] satanic power to vent the anger of the
[1:13:14] devil upon the true vine of god
[1:13:17] it will be a repeat performance of all
[1:13:19] diabolical cunning and cruelty
[1:13:22] those who fight the humble of god and
[1:13:24] scoff and destroy
[1:13:26] let them do it and do it they will
[1:13:29] and all in the name of god and religion
[1:13:32] but they lie
[1:13:33] they are not of god
[1:13:35] they are of
[1:13:37] the this is this part
[1:13:38] i want i want to go back up here
[1:13:41] it says
[1:13:44] as the beast rose at the nicene council
[1:13:46] so the image will come out of the world
[1:13:48] council of churches with all ungodly and
[1:13:50] satanic power to vent the anger of the
[1:13:52] devil upon the true vine of god
[1:13:56] do you hear that
[1:13:57] what will happen
[1:13:58] the image
[1:14:00] will do what
[1:14:03] it will come out
[1:14:06] that image
[1:14:08] okay i'm looking for the
[1:14:10] the path that part see right here
[1:14:15] as the viscerals are the missing cancer
[1:14:17] so the image will come out of the wild
[1:14:19] cancer of churches
[1:14:21] with all ungodly and satanic power to
[1:14:24] reinvent the anger of the devil upon the
[1:14:27] true vine of god
[1:14:28] do you know that this thing is
[1:14:30] information now did you know that
[1:14:33] actually it has already the image is
[1:14:35] already now clear
[1:14:36] that it is going to be made out of the
[1:14:38] america out of the u.s out of the why
[1:14:41] the kinds of churches is head what are
[1:14:42] there
[1:14:44] this is the image which will exercise
[1:14:47] the same power the same demonic satanic
[1:14:49] power like unto the first beast
[1:14:53] remember that the other beast was wrong
[1:14:56] it was that the the power which was
[1:14:57] persecuting the believers even this
[1:14:59] generation
[1:15:00] but now in any time it's going to be the
[1:15:03] world because they're religious they
[1:15:04] will
[1:15:05] also call themselves religious but this
[1:15:07] one will also be a religious movement
[1:15:09] claiming to wipe out those ones who are
[1:15:11] bad but actually they will be the one
[1:15:13] wiping out the true vine of god but of
[1:15:15] course they'll persecute but we know
[1:15:16] that persecution through persecution by
[1:15:18] the time
[1:15:19] it materializes
[1:15:21] that
[1:15:22] much the bride of christ will be out of
[1:15:24] here
[1:15:25] during the time when the
[1:15:27] the beast system will take over the
[1:15:29] world well i hope and believe that you
[1:15:31] would be ready to get out of here
[1:15:33] you know we sang something that they're
[1:15:35] ready to leave in a twinkling of an
[1:15:39] it will be a repeat performance of all
[1:15:40] diabolical cunning and cruelty
[1:15:44] those who fight the humble of god and
[1:15:46] scoff and destroy
[1:15:47] let them do it and do what they will
[1:15:50] and all in you hear that you are humble
[1:15:53] you are the humble of god a child of god
[1:15:55] right yes no big large rich you just
[1:15:59] humble someone who will laugh at you
[1:16:01] will scoff at you or you are a fool oh
[1:16:03] look at you the things you're doing the
[1:16:05] way you're addressing ah
[1:16:07] sister peace if you decide to do those
[1:16:09] things they will laugh at you don't
[1:16:10] scorn until they
[1:16:12] and he says sure they will they will
[1:16:15] don't ever think oh no me i'm praying
[1:16:16] that they want at least for me they win
[1:16:18] they must if they don't then you are one
[1:16:21] of them
[1:16:22] they should and they will
[1:16:24] right yes
[1:16:28] but they lie
[1:16:29] they are not of god
[1:16:31] they are of their father the devil they
[1:16:34] by their deeds against any people expose
[1:16:36] themselves for what they are
[1:16:38] let them organize and repudiate the
[1:16:40] little flock
[1:16:41] they but further reveal to all that they
[1:16:43] are of the devil
[1:16:45] they are the false vine
[1:16:47] the vine that murders
[1:16:49] their hatred proves who they are the
[1:16:51] nicolaitan antichrist church is who they
[1:16:53] are
[1:16:55] they shall be cast into prison
[1:16:58] yes they are hailed into court and
[1:16:59] falsely accused and tried and imprisoned
[1:17:02] and of course it is all done in the name
[1:17:04] of religion and decency and outraged
[1:17:06] innocency
[1:17:07] all done for a good cause
[1:17:09] that makes me think of the supreme
[1:17:11] court's ruling on prayer and bible
[1:17:13] reading in the schools who is behind it
[1:17:16] satan is
[1:17:17] it is just another angry outburst
[1:17:19] against god
[1:17:21] thou shalt have tribulation ten days
[1:17:24] i hope you know that uh there was a
[1:17:27] ruling
[1:17:28] i don't know i did not know that it
[1:17:30] happened even much earlier than
[1:17:32] in the days of rajabana but it was even
[1:17:34] recently that there wouldn't be bibles
[1:17:38] to be read in the churches in the u.s
[1:17:41] now you know
[1:17:42] when president trump came he tried to
[1:17:45] you know change that
[1:17:48] but
[1:17:50] even here in uganda and all countries
[1:17:52] this thing is coming
[1:17:55] yes
[1:17:56] they will not allow bibles to be read in
[1:17:58] schools
[1:18:00] they will not allow prayers to be made
[1:18:02] in schools
[1:18:05] they will also introduce new curriculums
[1:18:08] which
[1:18:09] are
[1:18:11] they've also they're one of the tribes
[1:18:13] even to do it already in other countries
[1:18:15] where they teach that
[1:18:17] in uh
[1:18:20] they teach types of families
[1:18:22] you know all of you the directive types
[1:18:24] of families in school
[1:18:26] there is how many types of families
[1:18:29] two types of families the first family
[1:18:33] the nuclear family and then there
[1:18:36] what's the nuclear family
[1:18:41] father mother biological children but
[1:18:44] they knew the extended family is
[1:18:49] the uncle's grandfather man they are all
[1:18:51] living together
[1:18:53] now
[1:18:54] that's all of us know this because we
[1:18:56] have been taught in school not in church
[1:18:57] did you know that yes
[1:18:59] now
[1:19:01] this new age this this devil is going to
[1:19:05] inspire these world leaders to introduce
[1:19:07] new curriculums that are
[1:19:09] adding another type of fun
[1:19:13] right and other types of family not even
[1:19:15] type
[1:19:16] where you have father father and
[1:19:18] children
[1:19:19] mother mother and children
[1:19:21] then the children will ask you see
[1:19:23] today we have two types of sex
[1:19:26] we have
[1:19:27] male
[1:19:28] and female
[1:19:30] in the new curriculum there will be more
[1:19:33] more not even two only or three only or
[1:19:36] four only there will be types of of
[1:19:38] sexes
[1:19:40] you know that'll be male
[1:19:42] female
[1:19:45] transgender
[1:19:49] gay lesbian and
[1:19:51] you know
[1:19:53] it is etc some of you don't even know
[1:19:55] what those things mean
[1:19:57] but this is what they're going to teach
[1:19:58] our children
[1:20:00] and children will ask
[1:20:01] teacher what does transgender mean
[1:20:04] and the teacher will have to explain
[1:20:06] that
[1:20:08] to explain directly things that are
[1:20:11] anti-word
[1:20:13] things that are antichrist
[1:20:16] they'll have to brainwash the children
[1:20:18] is mine
[1:20:19] so that
[1:20:21] actually the bride will not have to be
[1:20:23] here
[1:20:24] that bride will be squeezed out
[1:20:26] and this is where we are headed this has
[1:20:28] already started to work in some
[1:20:29] countries don't think it is
[1:20:31] like uh
[1:20:32] you know something that is not going to
[1:20:34] happen
[1:20:36] it's a new age it's a it's a devil's
[1:20:38] agenda
[1:20:39] the devil has an agenda but also god has
[1:20:41] an agenda if you do not submit to the
[1:20:43] agenda of god you will suddenly submit
[1:20:45] to the agenda of the devil
[1:20:47] and my my prayer for you each of you is
[1:20:49] that please submit to the agenda of god
[1:20:53] let him
[1:20:54] give you his word so that you can now
[1:20:56] transfer it to your children and their
[1:20:58] children will
[1:20:59] they should if the road turrets
[1:21:01] but if you yourself are not serious with
[1:21:03] god
[1:21:04] now ask yourself what generation is
[1:21:06] coming after you
[1:21:08] huh
[1:21:10] that's why you find even churches be
[1:21:12] that as big old churches in this message
[1:21:16] it can be on fire that when you know the
[1:21:18] other generation dies out this other
[1:21:20] generation is very lazy
[1:21:23] the others used to go the street and
[1:21:25] preach
[1:21:26] these ones even tell me to pretend the
[1:21:27] street huh
[1:21:28] takes off
[1:21:30] you know
[1:21:31] the other generation used to pray for
[1:21:33] the sick this one doesn't even know what
[1:21:34] prayer it means
[1:21:36] the other you know she used to speak in
[1:21:37] tongues these ones even they thought
[1:21:39] that tongues are no longer for believers
[1:21:42] the other generation used to you know
[1:21:44] be on fire sing and jump this generation
[1:21:47] you have to tell them hey come on clap
[1:21:49] your hands
[1:21:50] now tell me what generation is coming
[1:21:52] after this generation
[1:21:54] if a generation is this way is this what
[1:21:56] you want to pass on to another
[1:21:57] generation
[1:22:00] then how would your children be if you
[1:22:01] yourself are like this how will it be
[1:22:04] my desire is oh god let not only my
[1:22:08] generation but also the generation that
[1:22:09] you i will leave behind let it be a
[1:22:11] generation for you
[1:22:14] but if you don't don't even like
[1:22:15] yourself that your generation can be
[1:22:17] like this and then the other one
[1:22:20] will be good on fire from god forget
[1:22:22] about it it has to be passed down
[1:22:25] you see so you it has to begin with you
[1:22:28] the move begins with you the power of
[1:22:30] god begins with you the realities of the
[1:22:33] word begins with you because this god we
[1:22:35] are serving is not a god of history or
[1:22:36] god of stories is a god that is present
[1:22:40] every time when people seek him
[1:22:43] you will see these people how they
[1:22:44] suffer and say that that shall have
[1:22:45] tribulation 10 days here is a prophecy
[1:22:48] and with it is a means of determining
[1:22:50] the lifespan of the smyrnian age
[1:22:52] diocletian the cruelest of all emperors
[1:22:54] launched a terror campaign against the
[1:22:56] saints of god
[1:22:58] but except for the mercy of god would
[1:23:00] have wiped out all believers
[1:23:02] it was the bloodiest in history and
[1:23:04] lasted ten years the 10 days of
[1:23:06] revelation 2
[1:23:08] 10 be
[1:23:09] from 302 to 312
[1:23:13] be thou faithful unto death
[1:23:15] he does not say be faithful until
[1:23:19] no one stopped me there but then i want
[1:23:21] to ask do you understand that yes
[1:23:23] brother billy paul
[1:23:26] what are the 10 days that the bible is
[1:23:27] speaking of
[1:23:28] in this
[1:23:30] uh
[1:23:31] thou shalt have tribulation 10 days
[1:23:36] it's going to come
[1:23:39] it's going to come
[1:23:45] when
[1:23:48] whatever tribulation
[1:23:53] okay
[1:23:54] so what was that brother be reported
[1:23:56] rather
[1:23:59] where people are fed to animals
[1:24:06] yes
[1:24:08] all right so this was the time when the
[1:24:09] christians were really persecuted for a
[1:24:11] special period
[1:24:13] especially ten years from three to three
[1:24:15] or two to three
[1:24:17] one two
[1:24:18] and uh
[1:24:20] this was uh the the time of this uh
[1:24:23] emperor
[1:24:24] called darcian
[1:24:26] who was a roman emperor and he
[1:24:28] persecuted the christians of course
[1:24:30] christians have been persecuted for very
[1:24:32] many years
[1:24:33] and it's not a new it's not like it's a
[1:24:35] new thing
[1:24:36] you know
[1:24:37] it's
[1:24:38] true if they're if the christians were
[1:24:40] persecuted then
[1:24:41] they're passing they are also they
[1:24:43] should be oh there must be persecution
[1:24:46] today also
[1:24:47] and that there will be persecution also
[1:24:49] so it's not like uh it happened then it
[1:24:51] will not happen now and do not happen in
[1:24:53] the future it happened then it's it's
[1:24:55] gonna happen in the future and it should
[1:24:57] happen now if god moved then
[1:25:00] and he's going to move in the future
[1:25:02] should he move now
[1:25:04] so you see it it has to be the same way
[1:25:07] so that's why we cannot put god in the
[1:25:09] past and put him in the future
[1:25:11] and do not put him in our today
[1:25:14] if god moved
[1:25:15] now
[1:25:17] and he will move
[1:25:19] if we move go with god move in the past
[1:25:21] and he will move in the future he must
[1:25:24] move now
[1:25:25] or the one who moved in the past was not
[1:25:27] good
[1:25:29] and if the devil moved then and he's
[1:25:32] gonna move in the future is moving now
[1:25:35] then god must move yes people are saying
[1:25:37] that you know they're chasing out demons
[1:25:39] they're casting out demons but they
[1:25:40] don't believe in the power of godly
[1:25:43] unless you are saying the devil does not
[1:25:45] is not in existence today
[1:25:47] then i cannot agree to what you are
[1:25:49] saying that uh
[1:25:51] god is not
[1:25:52] here today miracles don't exist today do
[1:25:55] you believe in miracles yes how many
[1:25:58] believe in miracles here
[1:25:59] amen just shout amen
[1:26:01] yeah we believe in miracles and if
[1:26:04] miracles still exist then that means god
[1:26:07] is still here because it is god who does
[1:26:09] miracles it's good who moves it's good
[1:26:11] who speaks it's god who sets free
[1:26:14] all right let us proceed but unto death
[1:26:17] you may have to seal your testimony with
[1:26:19] your blood
[1:26:20] thousands yay millions have died during
[1:26:22] all the ages they died in the faith
[1:26:26] like antipas the faithful martyr they
[1:26:28] held not their lives dear unto death
[1:26:31] often we think that it would be almost
[1:26:32] impossible to be a martyr
[1:26:34] but dare to recall that the faith we
[1:26:36] daily use to triumph in christ jesus is
[1:26:39] the same faith that upholds the
[1:26:40] polycarps and all martyrs the supreme
[1:26:43] faith will give supreme grace for the
[1:26:45] supreme hour blessed be god forever
[1:26:49] and i will give the
[1:26:50] supreme
[1:26:52] faith will give supreme christ bring
[1:26:55] grace for
[1:26:57] hallelujah isn't that wonderful
[1:27:00] hey man of life
[1:27:02] since not even a cup of cold water given
[1:27:05] in the name of the lord fails to receive
[1:27:06] a reward
[1:27:08] how great shall be the reward to him who
[1:27:10] gives his life as a martyr for the name
[1:27:12] of the lord jesus
[1:27:13] perhaps we can get a small idea if we
[1:27:15] compare this crown with the crown one in
[1:27:17] a race
[1:27:19] in first corinthians 9 24 paul says
[1:27:22] know ye not that they which run in a
[1:27:25] race run all but one receiveth the prize
[1:27:28] so run that ye may obtain
[1:27:31] a crown given to the winner of the
[1:27:32] olympic race was a garland of olive
[1:27:34] branches
[1:27:35] but the crown spoken of here in the
[1:27:37] revelation given to a martyr is the
[1:27:39] crown of royalty
[1:27:41] jesus calls it the crown of life
[1:27:43] the one crown is for those who have
[1:27:45] striven
[1:27:46] the other is for those who have given
[1:27:48] both crowns are incorruptable they will
[1:27:51] not perish
[1:27:52] the winners of the worldly race of life
[1:27:54] will soon lose the joy of the plaudits
[1:27:56] of the world their glory will fail but
[1:28:00] those who give their lives for god
[1:28:02] either by daily striving or shedding
[1:28:04] their blood as the crowning sacrifice of
[1:28:06] their lives will be given the crown of
[1:28:08] life
[1:28:10] all too little time is spent on laboring
[1:28:12] for the eternal rewards of god
[1:28:14] the recompense of god is too lightly
[1:28:16] esteemed
[1:28:18] if we believe in the reality of the
[1:28:19] resurrection of the body and an eternal
[1:28:22] kingdom of substance
[1:28:23] then we ought to lay up in heaven those
[1:28:25] good treasures that are available to the
[1:28:27] faithful saints
[1:28:30] the reward for overcoming
[1:28:33] revelation 2 11
[1:28:35] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:28:37] the spirit sayeth unto the churches he
[1:28:40] that overcometh shall not be hurt of the
[1:28:42] second death
[1:28:44] now once again the spirit is talking to
[1:28:46] all the ages
[1:28:47] this message is to comfort us today even
[1:28:49] as it has comforted our brethren of all
[1:28:51] the other ages
[1:28:53] and he says to us that the second death
[1:28:55] will not hurt us
[1:28:57] we all know that the second death is the
[1:28:59] lake of fire
[1:29:00] revelation 20 14
[1:29:03] and death and hell were cast into the
[1:29:05] lake of fire
[1:29:07] this is the second
[1:29:08] death what's the second date
[1:29:14] okay so
[1:29:15] what's the first the first one
[1:29:22] huh according to you what is the first
[1:29:25] day
[1:29:30] please people when we are hearing okay
[1:29:32] ask questions
[1:29:35] this is something that you raise up your
[1:29:37] hand we will talk about it don't just
[1:29:39] we are not coming here to be entertained
[1:29:42] huh
[1:29:43] be active
[1:29:44] ask questions yes brother
[1:29:48] huh
[1:29:49] see
[1:29:50] where did you see that
[1:30:00] is saying that when we die from here
[1:30:02] that is
[1:30:03] the first day
[1:30:05] exactly hallelujah
[1:30:07] the first date is when we die from here
[1:30:11] yeah the death the death of the flesh
[1:30:14] and then the second death is the real
[1:30:16] serious issue
[1:30:18] you know whoever goes into the first
[1:30:19] death will resurrect
[1:30:22] boom did you hear that yes
[1:30:25] whoever goes into the first death will

[1:35:00] himself to come down from him and
[1:35:02] in that place
[1:35:04] that's where the bride will be
[1:35:06] with the bread room
[1:35:08] for some time what
[1:35:10] how long will that time
[1:35:14] what what's what does the iranian mean

[1:35:28] rejoicing hallelujah
[1:35:31] one day is equal to one thousand look at
[1:35:33] me if you don't understand
[1:35:39] three and a half years
[1:35:41] that is that's now the time for eating
[1:35:43] is the time for the marriage supper
[1:35:45] of the lamb in heaven
[1:35:49] you will know when you get there just
[1:35:51] get there you know yes
[1:35:54] after they come down
[1:35:57] for 1000 years
[1:36:02] three and a half years
[1:36:04] remember the three and a half years
[1:36:07] not days yes
[1:36:16] it is just three and a half years
[1:36:18] real real like
[1:36:20] generally
[1:36:21] okay
[1:36:23] that's that's a good question
[1:36:26] if you have been following the series
[1:36:27] that i was teaching you shouldn't have
[1:36:29] asked that
[1:36:30] because
[1:36:32] for every wednesday we are teaching on
[1:36:34] the dispensation of the gentiles
[1:36:37] and before i touched on this perception
[1:36:39] of the gentiles i did speak a little bit
[1:36:42] about uh
[1:36:44] let me first stop this for a minute here
[1:36:46] you know i i i i touched on the
[1:36:49] uh under what 70 weeks of
[1:36:53] daniel and i told you that the 70 weeks
[1:36:55] of daniel was weeks of years
[1:36:58] and and and that time
[1:37:02] that time
[1:37:03] line or the time span
[1:37:05] of the 70 weeks of the jews
[1:37:08] started at a time when the instruction
[1:37:10] was given to rebuke jerusalem
[1:37:13] and it
[1:37:14] goes all through until the millennium
[1:37:17] you understand
[1:37:18] so it's the time of god working with the
[1:37:20] jews not the gentiles but the what the
[1:37:23] jews but that time was cut off when the
[1:37:25] messiah was cut off
[1:37:27] and that time when it was cut off it was
[1:37:30] cut off
[1:37:31] in the last seven years because remember
[1:37:33] there was one week which when the
[1:37:35] messiah came that week started and the
[1:37:38] messiah ministered for a three
[1:37:40] the messiah christ ministered for a
[1:37:42] special three years and a half
[1:37:44] and that special three years and a half
[1:37:47] was
[1:37:49] then he was cut off and from that time
[1:37:52] the jews were cut off because remember
[1:37:55] the time was paused the moment the
[1:37:58] messiah was cut off but he was no longer
[1:38:00] working with them according to romans
[1:38:02] chapter 11
[1:38:03] this is what we are discussing every
[1:38:05] wednesday we have been discussing that
[1:38:06] every wednesday so you have to go back
[1:38:08] to those videos if you didn't understand
[1:38:09] you watch it again you will get it very
[1:38:11] well so
[1:38:13] so then the messiah was cut off now
[1:38:15] their time was paused you're going to
[1:38:16] put a pose on it so that you can do what
[1:38:18] do something do what
[1:38:21] what is that something that you used to
[1:38:22] do
[1:38:27] both of those answers are correct but
[1:38:30] the one i love more is the other one he
[1:38:32] was looking for a bride hallelujah
[1:38:35] he his intention was to have a wife
[1:38:38] even you brother when you grow up a
[1:38:40] little bit
[1:38:41] your intention will not be money
[1:38:47] just like joseph he was sold among the
[1:38:49] egyptians but when he reached there he
[1:38:50] said i have to find a bride for myself
[1:38:52] even christ
[1:38:54] he was thrown among the gentiles he said
[1:38:55] okay fine i will use this to
[1:38:57] find a bride for myself
[1:38:59] and he became lord over us as a god said
[1:39:01] lord
[1:39:02] we call him lord jesus because he has
[1:39:04] become a prince among us he has become a
[1:39:07] beloved among us and so he is now
[1:39:10] seeking for a bride for a space of how
[1:39:13] long
[1:39:14] we do not know how many years but what
[1:39:16] we know is that it's going to be a space
[1:39:18] of seven gentile dispensations
[1:39:21] and those seven gender dispensations is
[1:39:24] actually seven edges
[1:39:26] which we call the seven church edges
[1:39:28] seven churches which god is in each
[1:39:30] church calling out a bride calling out a
[1:39:32] bride and then after this first of these
[1:39:34] seven church edges what will happen uh i
[1:39:37] think i'll have to get you a picture
[1:39:39] here for you to see what i'm explaining
[1:39:41] uh after the specifics
[1:39:44] after the space of the seven church ages
[1:39:47] then it is going to go back again to the
[1:39:49] jews all right then that would be the
[1:39:53] last remaining remember it was seven
[1:39:55] years it was cut into two how much was
[1:39:57] remaining
[1:39:59] come on somebody have you been following
[1:40:01] me
[1:40:02] yeah three and a half years okay so the
[1:40:05] three and a half years which was
[1:40:07] remaining is going to be completed this
[1:40:09] is remember which was the time of the
[1:40:10] jews it's going to be completed at a
[1:40:13] time when the messiah goes back to
[1:40:18] the jews where would you be at that time
[1:40:23] because you will be in heaven
[1:40:26] on the marriage sucker
[1:40:27] then now from there
[1:40:29] on down
[1:40:32] when we come back
[1:40:34] we are going to come back at the end of
[1:40:36] the three years and a half
[1:40:38] not only that but also at the end of the
[1:40:41] third world war because remember the
[1:40:43] third world war the one
[1:40:44] to put a stop on it would be the messiah
[1:40:47] himself christ himself he will come down
[1:40:50] with ten thousands of his saints you
[1:40:52] come riding on a cloud hallelujah behold
[1:40:56] he comes riding on the clouds shining
[1:40:59] like the sun had a trumpet call so lift
[1:41:03] your voice it's the ear of jubilee out
[1:41:06] of zion's his salvation calm there's
[1:41:09] nobody like jehovah there's no god like
[1:41:12] jehovah there's nobody come on now
[1:41:16] there's
[1:41:28] [Music]
[1:41:29] oh
[1:41:38] [Music]
[1:41:40] salvation
[1:41:43] [Music]
[1:41:46] see that is happening when we are coming
[1:41:49] down with him
[1:41:50] we are going to come with him and we are
[1:41:52] coming to take over this world hey
[1:41:55] that is when that scripture will be
[1:41:56] fulfilled which says the kingdoms of the
[1:41:58] world have become the kingdom
[1:42:01] remember the stone which was held down
[1:42:03] from a big rock without a hand
[1:42:06] and it hit that image
[1:42:08] that uh the because i saw that stone
[1:42:11] it means the kingdom of god it will come
[1:42:13] and hit the kingdoms of the world and
[1:42:15] finish it completely because remember by
[1:42:17] the time it comes it will be during the
[1:42:18] war of armageddon and them
[1:42:21] and then there will be there will be
[1:42:23] targeting to an electorate wipe out
[1:42:26] israel at that time but you remember
[1:42:28] when he comes down he
[1:42:31] the bible says that they all saw him and
[1:42:34] when they saw him they brought all their
[1:42:36] nuclear whatever warheads and everything
[1:42:38] to shoot him down because like what is
[1:42:41] this so they turned it towards the event
[1:42:43] but the bible says that
[1:42:45] then you know he he he
[1:42:48] he consumed them with a sword out of his
[1:42:51] mouth
[1:42:52] hallelujah
[1:42:54] so he's not going to you know you know
[1:42:56] have artilleries like a nuclear warhead
[1:42:59] what he will have from his mouth will be
[1:43:01] stronger than that he'll only speak a
[1:43:03] word and they will all just be nothing
[1:43:05] you know hallelujah it will be
[1:43:06] smothering greens and debris and that
[1:43:09] will bring
[1:43:10] into this world a new era a new phase
[1:43:14] whereby the kingdoms of the world
[1:43:17] meaning america russia
[1:43:21] come on all those kingdoms you know it
[1:43:23] will no longer hold
[1:43:25] because remember for a space of three
[1:43:27] years and a half there was a world here
[1:43:29] there was things happening here you know
[1:43:32] russia was still there america was still
[1:43:33] here and all this was still here
[1:43:35] but they think they are super powers and
[1:43:37] of course they connect with raw excuse
[1:43:39] me wrong
[1:43:40] and vatican but you see by the time the
[1:43:43] lord jesus comes down
[1:43:46] we sing that song the lord is coming
[1:43:48] back to earth again
[1:43:49] the lord is coming back to us again
[1:43:53] a thousand years will have no temper
[1:43:55] then
[1:43:56] after jesus shall come back to us again
[1:43:59] one more time oh the lord is
[1:44:13] jesus shall come back to us again
[1:44:18] suddenly
[1:44:20] he will be bound with chains of
[1:44:22] circumstance
[1:44:24] what circumstance he will have no one to
[1:44:26] take
[1:44:27] that's why he will be bound for a space
[1:44:30] of a thousand years
[1:44:32] and of course we notice and understand
[1:44:33] that it is at the same time when he
[1:44:35] comes down he will finish the other
[1:44:38] phase and start another phase
[1:44:40] the first he will start he will be the
[1:44:42] king
[1:44:43] he will be the superpower
[1:44:46] and that someone tell me and then the
[1:44:49] bride will be in there with him to rule
[1:44:52] with him
[1:44:53] to rule what in his kingdom through the
[1:44:55] whole world
[1:44:56] don't think that the whole world will be
[1:44:57] just soil and things you know there it
[1:45:00] is ruined you know
[1:45:03] everything gets ringed
[1:45:04] but there will be a few men that will be
[1:45:06] left the bible says it
[1:45:08] and those remnants
[1:45:10] will multiply like the sons of the sea
[1:45:14] of course we don't know how they survive
[1:45:16] but
[1:45:17] i presume some of them would you know in
[1:45:19] the north pole and in the south pole
[1:45:20] they will survive they will hide
[1:45:22] themselves and from the wrath of god and
[1:45:25] others you know these days they have
[1:45:26] bankers they call them nuclear bankers
[1:45:29] they hide the die you know those big
[1:45:30] guests and those big kind of
[1:45:32] those
[1:45:34] leaders
[1:45:35] you know they would hide there and they
[1:45:37] would come out afterwards you know they
[1:45:38] even acted movies out of that was this
[1:45:40] is their movie called credit or
[1:45:42] something like that
[1:45:43] and so they they come out after the
[1:45:46] world is new
[1:45:48] you know you know these people who
[1:45:50] played who wrote the scripts probably
[1:45:52] they read the bible so they will come
[1:45:53] out
[1:45:55] everything is new
[1:45:58] they don't know what is in the world now
[1:45:59] they have to hunt for life and they will
[1:46:01] not find that but actually the truth of
[1:46:03] the matter is when they come out they
[1:46:05] will reunite work with whoever has been
[1:46:07] left and they will multiply quickly they
[1:46:09] will reproduce quickly and they will
[1:46:10] fill the world out again
[1:46:13] but guess what there won't be devil
[1:46:15] attempt them because you'll be bound at
[1:46:16] that time
[1:46:18] but guess what there will be another
[1:46:19] kingdom ruling on this world at that
[1:46:21] time
[1:46:22] and who will be the king
[1:46:24] he'll be the king of kings king jesus
[1:46:26] will have taken over he'll be ruling
[1:46:28] with who within me oh
[1:46:32] oh my
[1:46:33] god
[1:46:34] when you say
[1:46:36] when you say that where the kingdom of
[1:46:38] uh of uk the the kingdom of the of great
[1:46:41] britain you know the the the the way it
[1:46:44] acts
[1:46:45] the way it does things you know some of
[1:46:46] these things take only what is going to
[1:46:48] happen
[1:46:48] when you see them you know they call
[1:46:50] this on the duke of
[1:46:52] a somewhere the duke of
[1:46:54] whatever the duke or whatever that's how
[1:46:56] we shall be you know maybe you you will
[1:46:58] be the duke of america
[1:47:00] duke of africa you better you understand
[1:47:03] remember it's going to be the bride out
[1:47:05] of seven
[1:47:07] churches hallelujah so i'm sure that
[1:47:09] every bride of one generation will
[1:47:11] probably be given to be the duke of of
[1:47:14] one of the continents
[1:47:16] amen we will rule this one amen and
[1:47:20] all
[1:47:23] bowing down to us
[1:47:24] so don't bow down to the world now if
[1:47:26] you bow down to the world now you would
[1:47:28] that you you they will
[1:47:29] you you will not be in that time
[1:47:32] but if you if you you you bow to jesus
[1:47:35] christ now and he is why
[1:47:38] during that time they will bow down to
[1:47:40] you also
[1:47:41] your time is coming
[1:47:44] now it is their time but yours is coming
[1:47:46] wait hallelujah
[1:47:48] [Applause]
[1:47:58] because you will be appointed by the
[1:48:00] king of kings that's right
[1:48:02] with him
[1:48:14] listen to this he will be the director
[1:48:16] speaking
[1:48:25] speak when he has spoken
[1:48:28] and we will be there to rule with him
[1:48:31] imagine then after one thousand years
[1:48:34] now we can now comfortably judge
[1:48:36] everyone who was there the bible says
[1:48:38] everyone who has ever lived with rights
[1:48:41] that is the mass resurrection system
[1:48:44] the second now
[1:48:46] the
[1:48:47] the resurrection now
[1:48:49] the first one was for the bride now this
[1:48:50] is the second floor everyone else they
[1:48:53] will resurrect
[1:48:54] for judgment
[1:48:57] that's why the bride is not going to be
[1:48:59] in the judgment
[1:49:00] because for us we don't resurrect a long
[1:49:02] long time ago we have been here for a
[1:49:04] long time so we just mean we won't be in
[1:49:06] the before the white throne judgment but
[1:49:08] we will be on it
[1:49:09] why because we will be judging together
[1:49:11] with him
[1:49:13] imagine
[1:49:14] don't lose this don't miss this
[1:49:17] don't miss this for cheap cheap things
[1:49:18] here for cheap things of the world
[1:49:20] imagine how can you miss this how can
[1:49:23] you miss because of anything compare can
[1:49:25] you compare these things over the world
[1:49:27] right now

[1:49:32] what does the scripture say

[1:49:36] we cannot compare these things at all
[1:49:39] what we shall get if we are patient if
[1:49:42] we overcome we cannot compare
[1:49:47] the bible says in the book of roman book

[1:59:08] took care but abandoned was able to
[1:59:11] speak like someone who has been in hell
[1:59:13] and someone was bringing heaven at the
[1:59:14] same time he came back and he said when
[1:59:16] i was there
[1:59:18] i looked on down i saw all those muggles

[1:59:56] but i'm saying when you see a woman
[1:59:57] wearing lipstick call him mrs dog's meat
[2:00:01] it might sound hard but that's the truth

[2:01:23] give up don't give it don't surrender
[2:01:25] don't be great don't bow down to the
[2:01:27] door
[2:01:28] hallelujah
[2:01:29] oh my wish you can make that result
[2:01:32] myself i made it i made it
[2:01:34] i made it about 16 years ago now i
[2:01:36] married man and ever since i've never
[2:01:39] never turned down
[2:01:41] i've never let down the mass
[2:01:44] by grace of god
[2:01:45] you two can do it
[2:01:48] there is nothing can hinder you
[2:01:51] there is no enemy that can defeat you
[2:01:54] there is no nothing can make you not do
[2:01:56] it if you so desire to have it
[2:02:00] then
[2:02:01] they don't know what is taking place
[2:02:05] they may not be committing right now in
[2:02:06] nam gong but you are the greatest group
[2:02:08] that there is
[2:02:12] because you know what it's going to be
[2:02:14] like
[2:02:15] the rest of the people they're just
[2:02:16] fantasizing maybe this will happen maybe
[2:02:19] they don't know maybe oh i didn't even
[2:02:21] know where i came from so where would i
[2:02:22] go
[2:02:24] they don't know nothing but you know
[2:02:26] if they want answers you are the answer
[2:02:29] hallelujah
[2:02:31] i mean you can't do this you can't do
[2:02:32] this anymore
[2:02:34] i can't why
[2:02:35] what's wrong with you because i found
[2:02:38] something i found something that
[2:02:41] it's much more valuable than these
[2:02:42] things of the world i know you're a fool
[2:02:45] well if i'm a fool i better be a fool
[2:02:47] then
[2:02:48] than to perish i better be a fool and
[2:02:51] and receive that glory then
[2:02:53] than to be wise now
[2:02:56] and be a fool then
[2:02:59] think about those things
[2:03:02] shall we proceed
[2:03:17] of course that means all those who were
[2:03:19] therein were cast into the lake of fire
[2:03:22] now then i want to bring out something
[2:03:24] here for you
[2:03:25] it no doubt will cause people to comment
[2:03:27] on my strange doctrine
[2:03:29] but i stand here on the authority of the
[2:03:31] word of god and deny that the unbeliever
[2:03:33] goes to an eternal hell and burns their
[2:03:35] eternally
[2:03:36] in the first place hell or the lake of
[2:03:38] fire or whatever you want to call it is
[2:03:41] not eternal
[2:03:42] how can it be if it had a beginning
[2:03:45] in matthew 25 41 it says that
[2:03:48] everlasting fire was prepared for the
[2:03:50] devil and his angels
[2:03:52] now if it was prepared then it wasn't
[2:03:54] without a beginning if it had a
[2:03:56] beginning then it can't be eternal
[2:03:59] of course you might stumble over the
[2:04:00] idea of the word everlasting
[2:04:03] but that word means from the ages to the
[2:04:05] ages
[2:04:06] and has different meanings attached to
[2:04:08] it
[2:04:09] in first samuel 3 13-14
[2:04:12] god told samuel that he was going to
[2:04:13] judge the house of eli forever
[2:04:16] and that they would offer no more
[2:04:17] sacrifices forever as his priests
[2:04:21] and in second kings 2 27 solomon thrust
[2:04:24] out the last descendants of eli from the
[2:04:26] priesthood
[2:04:28] that was four generations or so later
[2:04:31] now you can see that everlasting does
[2:04:33] not compare with what is eternal or that
[2:04:36] which had no beginning or end
[2:04:38] here in this case the word everlasting
[2:04:40] means to the vanishing point
[2:04:43] that is what happened
[2:04:44] they vanished
[2:04:46] look at the word destruction over in
[2:04:49] second thessalonians 1 9. who shall be
[2:04:52] punished with everlasting destruction
[2:04:54] in the greek destruction positively
[2:04:57] means annihilation
[2:04:58] and the word destruction does not mean
[2:05:01] destroying
[2:05:03] now destroying means something going on
[2:05:05] and on in decay
[2:05:06] so what can everlasting annihilation
[2:05:08] mean
[2:05:09] it doesn't mean to keep on annihilating
[2:05:11] or that would make the word destroying
[2:05:14] instead of destruction
[2:05:16] it means to destroy to the ending point
[2:05:19] end it
[2:05:21] you might wonder now when you can use
[2:05:22] that word eternal and not use it the way
[2:05:25] we have been taught
[2:05:26] that is easy
[2:05:28] when it applies to god it means to be
[2:05:30] without beginning or end and ever
[2:05:32] enduring and never ceasing
[2:05:34] and when you talk of eternal life you
[2:05:36] have that in mind which is the life of
[2:05:38] god
[2:05:39] this is the record that god has given us
[2:05:41] eternal life
[2:05:43] and that life is in the sun
[2:05:45] he that hath the son hath life
[2:05:48] now then only sons of god have life
[2:05:50] eternal the kind that never had a
[2:05:53] beginning but always was
[2:05:55] that is right
[2:05:56] you have something in you right now that
[2:05:58] is eternal without beginning or end
[2:06:01] it is the spirit of god
[2:06:03] it is a part of god himself it is the
[2:06:06] life of god
[2:06:08] now if a sinner is going to go to hell
[2:06:10] and then suffer the same as you are
[2:06:12] going to heaven and enjoy heaven
[2:06:14] then he has the same kind of life you
[2:06:16] have already
[2:06:18] well then there might be those who say
[2:06:19] eternal life signifies the welfare of
[2:06:21] the children of god
[2:06:23] it is their welfare and enjoyment that
[2:06:25] is at stake
[2:06:27] on the other hand the sinner goes to his
[2:06:29] punishment
[2:06:30] so that we can reduce the second death
[2:06:32] to a matter of punishment and place
[2:06:34] eternal life means heaven and eternal
[2:06:36] punishment means hell
[2:06:38] you would be surprised at the men who
[2:06:40] have been exalted as theologians that
[2:06:41] believed that
[2:06:43] but do you know what that does
[2:06:45] it makes eternal life a matter of
[2:06:47] geography instead of a person
[2:06:49] eternal life is god the lord jesus
[2:06:52] christ
[2:06:53] how anyone could believe such a thing
[2:06:55] that eternal life is a matter of place
[2:06:57] is more than i know
[2:07:01] okay some another question
[2:07:04] um
[2:07:16] yes
[2:07:18] and then right now when we stop she was
[2:07:20] explaining the point saying that
[2:07:23] when we talk about eternal life
[2:07:25] it's not a place it's not a geographical
[2:07:28] place
[2:07:29] that you are thrown in in some place and
[2:07:32] you're going to be there for eternity
[2:07:34] eternal destruction means it's going to
[2:07:36] do our with you and highlight you
[2:07:39] how long does it take for you to be in
[2:07:40] that geographical fire that place where
[2:07:43] you're going to be
[2:07:44] for how long frontiers wants to do over
[2:07:46] with you
[2:07:48] but
[2:07:49] but
[2:07:50] eternal life in itself
[2:07:53] is not a place
[2:07:55] eternal life
[2:07:58] is a person
[2:08:00] it is god himself there's only one
[2:08:02] source of eternal life and that is zoey
[2:08:04] god is own life
[2:08:05] there are fire that's why we cannot say
[2:08:07] that hell is eternal because if you say
[2:08:10] that hell is eternal
[2:08:12] it means
[2:08:13] in the people's understanding when you
[2:08:15] say that hell is eternal to them they
[2:08:18] kind of feel that uh
[2:08:20] you actually mean that uh
[2:08:22] the people are going to be there
[2:08:24] like you are going to be in heaven
[2:08:27] you're going to be in hell for eternity
[2:08:30] and i'm going to be in heaven for
[2:08:31] eternity
[2:08:32] if that were to be true
[2:08:34] it means we all have the same kind of
[2:08:36] eternity
[2:08:37] do you understand
[2:08:39] eternity is life without end
[2:08:42] eternal means without end
[2:08:44] so if you're going to be in hell without
[2:08:47] end you already have eternal life
[2:08:50] you gotta pray how many get the point
[2:08:52] that's right if you say you're going to
[2:08:53] be in hell
[2:08:55] which will have no end
[2:08:57] it certainly means
[2:08:58] you have another life it is some sort of
[2:09:01] some kind of eternal life
[2:09:03] but again there is only one source of
[2:09:05] life that is god
[2:09:06] and how can i who is in christ had
[2:09:09] eternal life and then you who is in here
[2:09:10] having no life impossible
[2:09:13] so hell
[2:09:15] is a place where they will go
[2:09:18] and they will ban for years and years
[2:09:21] and years they will be punished there
[2:09:24] for years and years and years and years
[2:09:26] and decades and decades and millenniums
[2:09:28] until when he wants to grow with it
[2:09:33] okay
[2:09:34] in the new heaven and a new in the new
[2:09:35] art there's not going to be a hair
[2:09:38] that's one that that one's for you
[2:09:40] revelation 21. so there's no hair there
[2:09:43] because
[2:09:44] there's only going to be life and
[2:09:46] there's only one life that is joy god
[2:09:48] himself so those who are a part of him
[2:09:50] those who have a life like that of his
[2:09:52] will be there then
[2:09:54] praise the lord
[2:09:55] okay
[2:09:57] someone gets
[2:10:05] it makes me stagger to think of it
[2:10:08] no sir there is only one kind of eternal
[2:10:11] life
[2:10:12] god has it
[2:10:13] if we have god we have eternal life in
[2:10:15] and through him
[2:10:17] so you see that word eternal or
[2:10:19] everlasting can be applied in various
[2:10:21] ways
[2:10:22] but when it applies to god
[2:10:24] he being what he is it has one meaning
[2:10:27] it is the duration of god
[2:10:29] you can't apply it like that to any
[2:10:31] other thing
[2:10:32] god alone is eternal and because he
[2:10:35] lives we live with him
[2:10:38] now don't let anyone say that i don't
[2:10:40] believe in a lake of fire and in
[2:10:41] punishment
[2:10:42] i do
[2:10:44] i don't know how long it will last but
[2:10:45] it will eventually be removed
[2:10:48] in revelation 21 8 it says that those
[2:10:51] sinners mentioned will have their part
[2:10:53] in the lake of fire
[2:10:54] but the true interpretation of the word
[2:10:56] is not part but it is time
[2:10:59] see there you have it
[2:11:02] so the wicked shall be cast into hell
[2:11:04] hades or the grave and hell into the
[2:11:06] lake of fire
[2:11:08] separated from god what a terrible thing
[2:11:11] that will be
[2:11:12] but with the righteous it shall not be
[2:11:14] so
[2:11:15] they don't have to fear
[2:11:17] they have been redeemed by god they are
[2:11:19] in his bosom they are the overcomers
[2:11:22] and who is he that overcometh
[2:11:25] he that believeth that jesus is the
[2:11:27] christ
[2:11:28] why will this overcomer this believer
[2:11:31] escape and go into realms of eternal
[2:11:33] life and bliss
[2:11:34] because jesus paid a price to ransom us
[2:11:36] from sin he filled the gap of separation
[2:11:40] and we who were afar off are now made
[2:11:42] nigh by the blood
[2:11:44] and they will never come into
[2:11:46] condemnation
[2:11:47] they will never be in that lake of fire
[2:11:50] they can never be lost for he will lose
[2:11:52] none of them not one of the redeemed
[2:11:54] will be anywhere except where jesus is
[2:11:58] do you know why that is
[2:12:00] i'll illustrate it for you
[2:12:02] i have a little boy joseph
[2:12:04] he is a part of me no matter what
[2:12:05] happens
[2:12:07] if i were a rich man the worst i could
[2:12:08] do would be to disinherit him but there
[2:12:11] is nothing that i can ever do to deny
[2:12:13] him
[2:12:14] i can't because he is a part of me
[2:12:16] here let's take a blood test let's match
[2:12:19] his blood with mine it'll prove that
[2:12:21] joseph is my son he is mine
[2:12:24] it's the blood test that shows whether
[2:12:26] you belong to god or not
[2:12:29] i can't help thinking of the time that i
[2:12:31] used to ride heard on purebred herefords
[2:12:32] out in colorado
[2:12:34] we used to have to bring in those cattle
[2:12:36] for government inspection if we wanted
[2:12:38] them to feed on government range
[2:12:40] but they would not allow one single
[2:12:42] animal that did not have the blood tag
[2:12:43] on the ear
[2:12:45] the tag signified that it was purebred
[2:12:47] the rangers that looked them over did
[2:12:49] not once look at the brand they just
[2:12:51] looked at the tag to see that the blood
[2:12:53] was the right blood
[2:12:54] hallelujah if it's the right blood it's
[2:12:57] got to be right
[2:12:59] amen you know god looked down and
[2:13:01] declared
[2:13:02] the soul that sinneth it shall die
[2:13:05] it is separated from me
[2:13:07] it can't approach unto me
[2:13:09] we know that all have sinned and fallen
[2:13:12] short of the glory of god
[2:13:13] that meant that all died all were
[2:13:15] separated
[2:13:16] and one day a time would come when even
[2:13:19] that bit of life would be snuffed out
[2:13:21] and it would be all over
[2:13:23] but god in love took an animal and took
[2:13:25] its life in the place of the sinner's
[2:13:27] life
[2:13:28] in the old testament the sinner brought
[2:13:30] a lamb
[2:13:31] he placed his hand on the lamb while the
[2:13:33] priest cut the lamb's throat
[2:13:35] he felt the bleeding and heard the
[2:13:37] bleeding
[2:13:38] he felt the body stiffen in death he saw
[2:13:40] the smoke of the sprinkled blood ascend
[2:13:42] to god he knew that the lamb had taken
[2:13:45] his place
[2:13:46] he knew that the lamb's life had been
[2:13:48] forfeited for his
[2:13:50] but the life of that lamb was animal
[2:13:52] life and it could not come back upon the
[2:13:53] sinner making him clean
[2:13:56] so he left with the same desire to sin
[2:13:58] he would go out with sin in his mind and
[2:14:00] come back and offer a sacrifice for the
[2:14:02] same thing a year later
[2:14:05] but in the new testament it is not so
[2:14:08] our dying lamb is the son of god
[2:14:10] who gave his blood a ransom for many
[2:14:14] by faith we walk up and place our hands
[2:14:16] upon that lamb
[2:14:17] we see him with the bloody wounds the
[2:14:19] lacerated back the cruel thorns tearing
[2:14:22] his brow
[2:14:23] we feel his pain and hear him cry my god
[2:14:26] my god why hast thou forsaken me
[2:14:29] and what happened
[2:14:31] the life that left that broken blood
[2:14:33] cell came back upon the repentant one
[2:14:36] the life that was in him came back upon
[2:14:38] us
[2:14:39] we go back with no more desire to sin
[2:14:42] and we now possess a hatred for the
[2:14:44] works and lusts of the flesh
[2:14:46] look at us
[2:14:47] what is our life
[2:14:49] just one little cell that came from our
[2:14:51] father
[2:14:52] the female does not have the hemoglobin
[2:14:54] she produces the egg she is the
[2:14:56] incubator
[2:14:58] but the blood comes from the male
[2:15:00] that is why the woman takes the man's
[2:15:02] name the children take his name
[2:15:04] the mother is the incubator for the
[2:15:06] children she bears him
[2:15:08] that is what happened for our redemption
[2:15:11] the holy ghost came upon mary and she
[2:15:13] bore a son and called him jesus
[2:15:15] the great creator came down and became a
[2:15:17] sacrifice for our sin
[2:15:20] his blood was the blood of god
[2:15:22] that is exactly what it was
[2:15:24] that blood of god was shed and the
[2:15:26] spirit left him as he died in agony
[2:15:29] then the same life spirit came back to
[2:15:32] indwell the repentant sinner and set him
[2:15:34] free
[2:15:35] that sinner did not come back year after
[2:15:37] year sacrifice after sacrifice for there
[2:15:40] was no need
[2:15:42] by one sacrifice
[2:15:43] once and for all he has been set free
[2:15:46] from the dominion of sin
[2:15:47] and has received the life of christ
[2:15:49] whereby he reigns in victory over sin
[2:15:51] the world the flesh and the devil
[2:15:55] god did it
[2:15:56] he did it all
[2:15:58] how many things that you are reading
[2:16:00] over one the world
[2:16:12] [Music]
[2:16:14] the scene
[2:16:16] what is the scene that you're running
[2:16:18] over
[2:16:20] the world
[2:16:25] the world
[2:16:28] the flesh
[2:16:31] the devil
[2:16:33] and unbelief
[2:16:39] are you following
[2:16:44] mr peace
[2:16:46] what things
[2:16:47] must you reign
[2:16:49] over
[2:16:52] see what is see
[2:16:54] and believe of the word
[2:16:57] of the world when you hear the word you
[2:17:00] have seen this in the bible you have
[2:17:01] seen it is the word of god but you
[2:17:03] refuse to do to do it you do something
[2:17:05] else that is it
[2:17:06] ah the second one
[2:17:09] that
[2:17:10] that the devil
[2:17:12] the third one
[2:17:14] the devil comes to you how
[2:17:19] i preached on that on sunday how does
[2:17:21] the devil come to you
[2:17:25] can someone help her how does the devil
[2:17:27] come to you
[2:17:30] in your mind
[2:17:32] he talks to you every day
[2:17:35] even now he may be talking every time he
[2:17:37] talks in your mind
[2:17:40] that's how the devil comes so you must
[2:17:41] overcome that as well
[2:17:43] number three
[2:17:47] you just saw with me the wire the the
[2:17:49] sin then the devil then
[2:17:54] the world
[2:17:56] are you hearing this
[2:17:58] the world
[2:18:00] that one
[2:18:01] has taken very many young people
[2:18:03] they you know
[2:18:09] do not
[2:18:10] it says do not
[2:18:12] be
[2:18:13] conformed to this world
[2:18:16] but be renewed
[2:18:18] be transformed by the renewing of your
[2:18:21] mind
[2:18:22] you see
[2:18:23] so the world will want you to do certain
[2:18:25] things in a in a way but you must renew
[2:18:28] your mind to do it in another way
[2:18:31] you see they want you to dress this way
[2:18:33] renew your mind to dress another way
[2:18:35] they want you to talk this way even
[2:18:36] language your language must change you
[2:18:38] if your mouth can't change
[2:18:42] some of those things you were speaking
[2:18:43] there
[2:18:44] in those drunkards
[2:18:46] in those
[2:18:49] unbelievers
[2:18:50] your friends out there that kind of
[2:18:52] language it should change also
[2:18:55] it is amazing the the charges of today
[2:18:58] the pastors are saying it is therefore
[2:18:59] meeting even outreach
[2:19:01] by doing what they are not doing so that
[2:19:03] they can reach them out
[2:19:05] he comes a man he's a he looks to be a
[2:19:08] mature man but actually he he wears you
[2:19:11] know he wears like a shirt which is
[2:19:13] almost harmless and then
[2:19:16] he has all kanyama
[2:19:18] so and then he wears a chain and then
[2:19:20] you know he wears that evenly some of
[2:19:23] them bumble even
[2:19:25] at church
[2:19:26] and then he comes yo yo man yeah you
[2:19:29] know to these younger people so that you
[2:19:30] can get them in the church
[2:19:32] and then they bring the worldly singers
[2:19:33] in the church yeah yeah yeah yeah man
[2:19:35] yeah go in they might represent here
[2:19:37] they have their language
[2:19:39] they think
[2:19:41] that by behaving like the world they
[2:19:43] will win the world
[2:19:44] you can never win the world by behaving
[2:19:46] like the world
[2:19:48] that's not what paul meant to the romans
[2:19:50] i am a roman that's not what he meant
[2:19:53] okay
[2:19:55] that's not exactly what he meant
[2:19:59] when you are going to win the world you
[2:20:01] have to overcome it fast in order to win
[2:20:03] the world to christ
[2:20:06] you know one person told me was it
[2:20:08] brother wrong he was innovating to me
[2:20:09] some of these people when they when they
[2:20:11] do crusades
[2:20:13] they bring a busy they rent singers
[2:20:18] from africa band from whatever you know
[2:20:22] does he you know changing
[2:20:24] those kind of by having a boy they bring
[2:20:27] them then they begin singing
[2:20:43] some kind of show but uh

[2:20:59] the bread then afterwards they will pay
[2:21:02] him his money he will go and the pastor
[2:21:04] will come hallelujah
[2:21:06] yeah we have come to give you the word
[2:21:08] of life jesus says john 3 16 for god
[2:21:10] shall love the world and then now they
[2:21:12] have come rubbish
[2:21:16] how can i like be the forerunner of the
[2:21:20] world
[2:21:24] so they think that by at the meeting
[2:21:27] through the things the young people are
[2:21:28] doing that you will win them to you you
[2:21:30] will win them to christ no wonder when
[2:21:33] they come to quest they still don't get
[2:21:34] converted
[2:21:35] they remain in their miniskirts they're
[2:21:37] in their shorts the younger men they
[2:21:39] remain with their chains they remain
[2:21:40] with all those things they remain with
[2:21:42] that data language
[2:21:43] you know those kind of things you should
[2:21:45] not do that kind of thing you should let
[2:21:47] your mouth be washed by the blood of
[2:21:49] jesus christ
[2:21:50] hallelujah
[2:21:52] when you meet a brother
[2:22:01] if someone is doing it correct them
[2:22:04] don't also get caught up with that kind
[2:22:05] of language let your mouth be cleaned
[2:22:08] and washed amen
[2:22:10] not only your action on dressing and
[2:22:12] everything let everything about you
[2:22:13] decrease the bible says what i'm saying
[2:22:16] is the scripture it's the word it's not
[2:22:17] my thoughts he said
[2:22:19] considering the end of our conversation
[2:22:22] what do we talk what do we behave how do
[2:22:24] we behave how do we talk
[2:22:26] how do we behave you understand
[2:22:28] those things are possible said what i've
[2:22:30] been to you be to others
[2:22:34] who is your inspiration
[2:22:36] huh
[2:22:37] so why do we call ourselves brother so
[2:22:38] and so
[2:22:40] when when i meet you why do i say oh
[2:22:42] brother god bless you even if i am in
[2:22:44] any strange country may have traveled
[2:22:46] many countries but wherever i go i meet
[2:22:48] somebody they may know me because you
[2:22:50] i've been well on the internet blah blah
[2:22:52] blah publicized so someone may meet me
[2:22:54] say oh brother god bless you you know i
[2:22:56] was in zimbabwe i had never been there
[2:22:58] before and my first time killing life
[2:23:00] when i met somebody and this person said
[2:23:02] oh
[2:23:15] who are
[2:23:16] you because i did not know him but
[2:23:20] incidentally he had known me you know he
[2:23:22] had recognized me
[2:23:23] this is how it should be whereby we have
[2:23:25] codes that we can be able to know
[2:23:27] you know
[2:23:28] we also have a mark of christ that's the
[2:23:31] the mark of because whereby wherever you
[2:23:32] are you can be recognized by the way you
[2:23:35] dress the way you act you understand
[2:23:38] yeah they were asked there are men rasta
[2:23:40] men who worship the man rastafari in
[2:23:42] ethiopia they can recognize themselves
[2:23:44] they have said quote
[2:23:46] they have a chain
[2:23:49] they they smoke weed they do those
[2:23:52] things they yeah
[2:23:53] so
[2:23:54] when you when when when when you meet
[2:23:57] when you see those things
[2:23:59] and you meet him you recognize him yeah
[2:24:01] yeah
[2:24:02] my brother
[2:24:04] just been there because i know these
[2:24:05] things you know
[2:24:07] in a in a session it's called the money
[2:24:09] in ethiopia you know and they took me to
[2:24:11] their houses mind the house when you
[2:24:17] you know
[2:24:18] it's all deception of course
[2:24:20] you see it's like giving an option to
[2:24:22] christ
[2:24:23] and so
[2:24:24] it's all deception but you find them
[2:24:26] there they have their own code we as
[2:24:28] believers we also have our own code
[2:24:30] hallelujah
[2:24:31] one day i have been to nigeria my first
[2:24:33] time i did not know the the brother who
[2:24:36] i was going to see at the airport but i
[2:24:38] had a message book so i went with a
[2:24:40] message book
[2:24:41] with me here you know
[2:24:43] so you didn't see me he didn't know me
[2:24:44] but when he saw the message
[2:24:47] because he knew my name but he didn't
[2:24:48] know how i looked
[2:24:50] to me
[2:24:52] also hallelujah you say
[2:24:54] one day i was at the airport in a in a
[2:24:56] in um um what is this
[2:24:59] uh no no no ethiopia
[2:25:01] while at
[2:25:02] the ethiopian airport
[2:25:04] this brother comes to me and he had a
[2:25:06] book i do not know he's a believer but
[2:25:08] he's a congress i think he was a
[2:25:09] congressman maybe coming from china and
[2:25:11] then
[2:25:12] i said
[2:25:13] are you a believer
[2:25:17] god bless you immediately
[2:25:20] this is the code of believers world over
[2:25:24] hallelujah
[2:25:25] because we
[2:25:27] believe
[2:25:28] in the blessing of god
[2:25:30] and it makes rich and he adds no sorrow
[2:25:33] to it only so
[2:25:34] that is our code as believers therefore
[2:25:37] put that on so there are for brethren
[2:25:40] what i'm encouraging you let your mouth
[2:25:42] be washed let your life be washed let
[2:25:45] your behaviors be worse everything about
[2:25:47] you hallelujah
[2:25:48] and when someone is the opposite of what
[2:25:50] i'm preaching do not hate them but
[2:25:52] simply love them and teach them to do
[2:25:54] right by your actions not by simply
[2:25:57] talking sometimes
[2:25:59] even the bible says avoid unnecessary
[2:26:01] and stupid debates
[2:26:03] never debate the word when someone is
[2:26:05] debating they want to leave them alone
[2:26:06] don't debate the word never debate the
[2:26:08] word under no circumstance should you
[2:26:10] ever debate the word if someone is
[2:26:12] asking to know something tell them if
[2:26:14] they're debating leave them alone this
[2:26:16] is what brother banham said he was even
[2:26:17] refusing to go
[2:26:19] some also in collusion
[2:26:22] because he said i don't want to be
[2:26:23] better to those people and then brother
[2:26:25] who was which brother was it yeah
[2:26:27] i'm not going to debate these people
[2:26:29] they
[2:26:29] they want to hear you know
[2:26:32] you know i'm only going to take the
[2:26:34] scriptures and i will just give the
[2:26:35] people the scriptures i will not debate
[2:26:37] so when he confused by the parliament
[2:26:38] that he wasn't going to debate he was
[2:26:39] only going to give them the scriptures
[2:26:41] what the bible says and then leave
[2:26:43] him allowed him to go and then
[2:26:44] came covered you know
[2:26:46] and then he sat behind there until the
[2:26:48] period of fire came the holy spirit the
[2:26:49] prince of god came and told him go and
[2:26:52] led him to the pulpit and that's where
[2:26:54] when they took that picture i said
[2:26:55] purify was there but he did not go there
[2:26:58] to debate he went there to speak about
[2:27:00] his god period he wouldn't just be
[2:27:03] yeah
[2:27:05] you can even find them there the muslims
[2:27:06] are the seventh days
[2:27:10] [Applause]
[2:27:12] never go in those fruits don't waste
[2:27:14] your time with all these kind of things
[2:27:16] even when you think you're preaching to
[2:27:17] someone and they go into debating close
[2:27:19] the topic immediately because it will it
[2:27:21] will grip the spirit of god and the
[2:27:23] bible says grieve not there holy spirit
[2:27:25] of god which you were given until when
[2:27:27] the day of your redemption
[2:27:29] so we are not meant to debate with the
[2:27:31] people but we are simply meant to
[2:27:32] witness to them and show them love
[2:27:35] hallelujah
[2:27:36] show them what
[2:27:38] show them what how do you show up
[2:27:43] how do you show love somebody help me
[2:27:48] huh
[2:27:52] you have a point
[2:27:53] if someone can't see the word yet or is
[2:27:56] not yet revealed what is revealed to you
[2:27:58] even among each of you
[2:28:00] if i begin to take one point i'll ask
[2:28:03] each of you some things are revealed to
[2:28:04] you some are not each of us
[2:28:07] they have different levels of revelation
[2:28:11] now brother when something is revealed
[2:28:12] to you and it's not revealed to another
[2:28:14] you don't make them the devil because
[2:28:16] they simply didn't understand you
[2:28:18] but what you do as a child of god you
[2:28:21] bear with them
[2:28:23] love will bring forbearance love is kind
[2:28:26] love is wrong suffering
[2:28:28] love is you know what the voice is about
[2:28:30] challenge you don't read those things
[2:28:32] love never fails
[2:28:34] love
[2:28:35] covers the masterpiece love
[2:28:38] is corrective you can't see somebody and
[2:28:41] you love them doing something wrong and
[2:28:42] you'll be like god will correct them you
[2:28:44] don't love them
[2:28:47] because you review them you don't love
[2:28:48] them
[2:28:49] if you love them and they are doing
[2:28:51] something wrong meet them face them tell
[2:28:53] them what you're doing is wrong
[2:28:55] if they don't hear you you bring another
[2:28:57] brother don't just say if they don't
[2:28:58] hear you what the idiom period if they
[2:29:01] don't hear you you bring another brother
[2:29:03] to probably be a minister if they don't
[2:29:05] hear them they will bring you to the
[2:29:06] church to the church if they don't hear
[2:29:08] them they always communicate them out of
[2:29:09] you because it means they're not
[2:29:11] believers you understand
[2:29:13] this is how the scripture teaches us if
[2:29:15] you love somebody you correct them you
[2:29:17] tell them the love of god will draw you
[2:29:20] to draw them to christ we have a few
[2:29:22] moments let's just proceed again
[2:29:24] he cried out to the world cursed in sin
[2:29:27] i will give you a sign
[2:29:29] a virgin shall be with child
[2:29:31] a virgin shall conceive and bear a son
[2:29:34] that will be your sign it will be an
[2:29:36] everlasting sign
[2:29:38] what she brings forth will be emmanuel
[2:29:40] god with us
[2:29:43] god came down in a blood cell not
[2:29:45] through a man but by the holy ghost
[2:29:47] and in that virgin womb a tabernacle for
[2:29:49] the purpose of death was built
[2:29:51] the seed of the woman came in order that
[2:29:53] he be bruised to bring us our salvation
[2:29:56] when the holy ghost came upon mary he
[2:29:59] created within her womb the cell that
[2:30:00] would multiply and become the body of
[2:30:02] our lord that cell was created
[2:30:05] it was the beginning of the creation of
[2:30:07] god
[2:30:08] that is who jesus is
[2:30:11] and that holy one was filled with holy
[2:30:13] blood even the blood of god
[2:30:15] that tabernacle came to birth he grew to
[2:30:18] be a man
[2:30:19] he went to jordan and there that
[2:30:20] sacrifice was washed of john in the
[2:30:22] river called jordan
[2:30:24] when that acceptable sacrifice rose out
[2:30:27] of the water
[2:30:28] god came and indwelt him
[2:30:30] filling him with the spirit without
[2:30:31] measure
[2:30:32] and when he died and shed his blood
[2:30:35] the perfect life of god was liberated to
[2:30:37] come back upon the sinner who would
[2:30:39] accept the christ as his savior
[2:30:41] oh how striking it is
[2:30:43] jehovah born crying over a manure pile
[2:30:46] jehovah born in a manger of straw
[2:30:49] there is your everlasting sign to the
[2:30:51] proud and puffed up pseudo-intellectuals
[2:30:53] that have evolved their own theology and
[2:30:55] denied the truth of god
[2:30:57] jehovah god a crying baby in a stinking
[2:31:00] barn
[2:31:01] then we think we have a right to be
[2:31:03] proud holding up our noses criticizing
[2:31:06] and acting as though we were somebody
[2:31:08] here's your real sign
[2:31:10] this is the right one
[2:31:12] jehovah playing as a boy jehovah working
[2:31:14] in a carpenter's shop
[2:31:16] jehovah washing the feet of fishermen
[2:31:19] i'll give you a sign said god
[2:31:22] not the sign of a white-collared
[2:31:24] priesthood not the sign of wealth and
[2:31:26] power
[2:31:27] there's nothing in this sign that you
[2:31:28] will want or think suitable
[2:31:31] but it is an everlasting sign
[2:31:33] it is the greatest sign of all
[2:31:36] jehovah's standing in the courtyard
[2:31:38] bruised and bleeding with thorns on his
[2:31:40] brow and spit on his face
[2:31:42] mocked and set out not
[2:31:45] jehovah despised and rejected hanging
[2:31:47] naked upon the cross while the
[2:31:49] hypocrites jeered and dared him to come
[2:31:51] down off the cross
[2:31:52] jehovah dying
[2:31:54] jehovah praying and nothing happening
[2:31:57] then jehovah died
[2:31:59] that is the sign for all men now
[2:32:02] there isn't another like it
[2:32:03] it is the great one
[2:32:06] then darkness came upon the earth
[2:32:09] they put him in a tomb
[2:32:11] there he lay those three days and nights
[2:32:13] until an earthquake shattered the gloom
[2:32:15] of night and he came forth
[2:32:17] jehovah came forth jehovah ascended on
[2:32:20] high
[2:32:21] then jehovah returned to indwell his
[2:32:23] church jehovah came back with a mighty
[2:32:25] rushing wind and flames of fire
[2:32:28] jehovah came back to walk in the midst
[2:32:30] of his church and empower his people
[2:32:33] once more jehovah came
[2:32:35] and this time to stay in his people and
[2:32:38] again jehovah heals the sick raises the
[2:32:40] dead and manifests himself by the spirit
[2:32:43] jehovah came back speaking in tongues
[2:32:46] and giving the answer back in
[2:32:47] interpretation
[2:32:50] jehovah came down and he raised the
[2:32:52] prostitute to sin no more he came down
[2:32:54] to the drunkard with fly blows on his
[2:32:56] face as he lay unconscious in the gutter
[2:32:59] yes jehovah came to manifest in flesh
[2:33:01] and manifest through flesh jehovah came
[2:33:05] in us the hope of glory
[2:33:08] yes jesus came and shed his blood and
[2:33:11] set the captive free
[2:33:13] he came and redeemed his lost sheep
[2:33:15] he gave them eternal life and they shall
[2:33:17] never perish
[2:33:18] he won't lose one of them but raise them
[2:33:21] up at the last day
[2:33:23] hallelujah the second death cannot hurt
[2:33:25] them it has no power over them
[2:33:28] for they are the lambs and they follow
[2:33:30] him wherever he goes
[2:33:34] the holy spirit in every age
[2:33:37] revelation 2 11.
[2:33:39] okay there's a question here yes go
[2:33:41] ahead brother
[2:33:46] what is your question
[2:34:03] can you be a bit more vocal
[2:34:08] um
[2:34:26] okay
[2:34:38] um
[2:35:09] those are traditions
[2:35:11] those traditions were even here during
[2:35:14] the time of jesus
[2:35:16] but yet they would not believe him
[2:35:19] you remember
[2:35:21] they were doing those traditions
[2:35:23] even when jesus was here in flesh and
[2:35:26] they did believe
[2:35:27] him for who he was
[2:35:30] and they were continuing with their
[2:35:31] trade with the traditions
[2:35:33] so yes they do continue with the
[2:35:35] traditions
[2:35:36] but
[2:35:37] it holds nothing really
[2:35:40] because that tradition was only a shadow
[2:35:44] at a time
[2:35:46] of what of
[2:35:47] christ coming himself
[2:35:49] and when he came with the fulfillment of
[2:35:51] that type and shadow
[2:35:55] you know when when the holy spirit moves
[2:35:57] many people stay behind
[2:35:59] and they are like
[2:36:00] i am
[2:36:01] here
[2:36:03] because i'm doing what the world says
[2:36:06] do you notice the same word that told
[2:36:07] the people to put the blood on their
[2:36:09] door
[2:36:11] nose or whatever that's right
[2:36:13] and the same holy spirit that told them
[2:36:15] to move and go out
[2:36:19] but there are some
[2:36:20] who would say we're supposed to remain
[2:36:23] here this is where our protection is
[2:36:25] they even have proof
[2:36:27] brother when the death engine came we
[2:36:29] never died no none of us died
[2:36:32] here is our security we should remain
[2:36:34] here under the blood
[2:36:36] but
[2:36:37] there was more revelation
[2:36:40] move now under the cloud
[2:36:42] move now
[2:36:43] god is taking you to a higher level of
[2:36:45] revelation but basically if you would
[2:36:48] stay back still you would die
[2:36:50] so you see in the same same way we
[2:36:52] realized that these jews do not receive
[2:36:55] the revelation of
[2:36:57] the reality of their shadows and types
[2:37:00] and they they stay you know you always
[2:37:03] can receive the revelation that you have
[2:37:05] you have you can stay under that
[2:37:07] revolution you cannot go more than that
[2:37:09] if you believe you're poor for example
[2:37:10] you always believe you're poor you're
[2:37:12] not you're under that
[2:37:14] you know you cannot be more than what
[2:37:16] you believe you cannot be more than what
[2:37:19] is living new to you
[2:37:21] but
[2:37:22] when the messiah comes through the
[2:37:25] ministry of moses and elijah
[2:37:28] there are going to be jews 144 of then
[2:37:32] that will recognize the messiah
[2:37:35] to be
[2:37:36] the one that was the pastor of allah
[2:37:38] they will recognize him to be the lamb
[2:37:41] which was given in the in the temple
[2:37:43] they will recognize him to be the one
[2:37:46] that died
[2:37:48] to be the one who was the brazen serpent
[2:37:50] you remember that moses told them to put
[2:37:51] up they would recognize him to be all
[2:37:53] these things
[2:37:55] those 144 thousand jews and actually
[2:37:57] they would be the elect from among the
[2:37:58] jews
[2:37:59] so
[2:38:01] as regard the tradition yeah they
[2:38:02] continue with it but it doesn't hold any
[2:38:04] anyway they missed it they missed it
[2:38:07] many people even in our generation they
[2:38:09] continue worshiping the god they don't
[2:38:11] know because they missed it imagine they
[2:38:13] preach something that they missed like
[2:38:15] a thousand miles
[2:38:17] and they're enthused with that
[2:38:19] as if it were to be the truth
[2:38:21] you know if you you see them ah i'm
[2:38:23] going to baptize my baby i mean she's so
[2:38:25] happy and he's so happy baptize your
[2:38:27] baby
[2:38:29] wasting a lot of time for nothing and
[2:38:31] then after that you come and cook and
[2:38:33] hey
[2:38:34] baby baptism
[2:38:35] completely wasting time you know
[2:38:38] and
[2:38:39] someone comes and says i've been
[2:38:40] baptized
[2:38:41] they just use the titles on them and
[2:38:43] they're like ah yeah
[2:38:45] oh we have baptized them they even teach
[2:38:48] them how to speak tongues and they tell
[2:38:49] them you're baptizer now you have the
[2:38:50] holy spirit
[2:38:52] complete waste of time
[2:38:54] so
[2:38:55] but you can only be to the level of your
[2:38:58] revelation
[2:39:02] did you get the answer to your question
[2:39:08] hallelujah
[2:39:10] let's proceed
[2:39:12] he that hath an ear
[2:39:14] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[2:39:16] the churches
[2:39:17] there is not one church age where this
[2:39:19] verse is not mentioned
[2:39:21] every single age has the same admonition
[2:39:23] to the people of every age
[2:39:26] he that hath an ear
[2:39:27] let him hear what the spirit saith
[2:39:30] but it is absolutely impossible for all
[2:39:32] men to hear what the spirit says to the
[2:39:34] different ages
[2:39:36] first corinthians 2 6-16
[2:39:39] how be it we speak wisdom among them
[2:39:41] that are perfect
[2:39:43] yet not the wisdom of this world nor of
[2:39:45] the princes of this world that come to
[2:39:47] naught
[2:39:48] but we speak the wisdom of god in a
[2:39:50] mystery even the hidden wisdom which god
[2:39:53] ordained before the world unto our glory
[2:39:56] which none of the princes of this world
[2:39:58] knew
[2:39:58] for had they known it they would not
[2:40:00] have crucified the lord of glory
[2:40:03] but as it is written
[2:40:05] i hath not seen nor ear heard neither
[2:40:08] have entered into the heart of man
[2:40:10] the things which god hath prepared for
[2:40:12] them that love him
[2:40:13] but god hath revealed them unto us by
[2:40:16] his spirit
[2:40:17] for the spirit searcheth all things yea
[2:40:19] the deep things of god
[2:40:21] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[2:40:23] save the spirit of man which is in him
[2:40:26] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[2:40:29] but the spirit of god
[2:40:31] now we have received not the spirit of
[2:40:33] the world but the spirit which is of god
[2:40:36] that we might know the things that are
[2:40:38] freely given to us of god
[2:40:40] which things also we speak not in the
[2:40:42] words which man's wisdom teacheth
[2:40:45] but which the holy ghost teacheth
[2:40:47] comparing spiritual things with
[2:40:49] spiritual
[2:40:50] but the natural man receiveth not the
[2:40:52] things of the spirit of god
[2:40:54] for they are foolishness unto him
[2:40:56] neither can he know them because they
[2:40:58] are spiritually discerned
[2:41:00] but he that is spiritual judgeth all
[2:41:02] things yet he himself is judged of no
[2:41:05] man
[2:41:06] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[2:41:08] but he may instruct him
[2:41:10] but we have the mind of christ
[2:41:13] matthew 13 13-16
[2:41:17] therefore speak i to them in parables
[2:41:20] because they seeing see not and hearing
[2:41:22] they hear not
[2:41:23] neither do they understand
[2:41:25] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[2:41:27] isaias which saith by hearing ye shall
[2:41:30] hear and shall not understand
[2:41:33] and seeing ye shall see and shall not
[2:41:35] perceive
[2:41:36] for this people's heart is waxed gross
[2:41:39] and their ears are dull of hearing and
[2:41:41] their eyes they have closed
[2:41:43] lest at any time they should see with
[2:41:45] their eyes and hear with their ears and
[2:41:47] should understand with their heart and
[2:41:49] should be converted and i should heal
[2:41:51] them
[2:41:53] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[2:41:55] and your ears for they hear john 8 42-44
[2:42:01] jesus said unto them
[2:42:02] if god were your father you would love
[2:42:04] me
[2:42:05] for i proceeded forth and came from god
[2:42:08] neither came i of myself but he sent me
[2:42:11] why do you not understand my speech
[2:42:14] even because he cannot hear my word
[2:42:17] ye are of your father the devil and the
[2:42:20] lusts of your father you will do
[2:42:22] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[2:42:24] abode not in the truth because there is
[2:42:26] no truth in him
[2:42:28] when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of
[2:42:30] his own
[2:42:31] for he is a liar and the father of it
[2:42:34] it is most evident from these scriptures
[2:42:36] that no man of himself can hear god
[2:42:39] that ability has to be given him of god
[2:42:42] matthew 16
[2:42:44] 17
[2:42:46] and jesus answered and said unto him
[2:42:48] blessed art thou simon barjona
[2:42:51] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[2:42:53] unto thee but my father which is in
[2:42:55] heaven
[2:42:56] putting these verses together we see
[2:42:59] that there is only one group of people
[2:43:01] and that a very special group of people
[2:43:03] who are able to hear what the spirit
[2:43:05] says in each age
[2:43:06] it is one special group that receives
[2:43:08] the revelation for each age
[2:43:11] that is of god
[2:43:13] because the group that cannot hear is
[2:43:15] not of god
[2:43:16] john 8 42-44
[2:43:20] the group that can and does hear what
[2:43:21] the spirit is saying and receives the
[2:43:23] revelation thereof
[2:43:25] is that group described in first
[2:43:26] corinthians two six through sixteen
[2:43:30] they are the ones who have the spirit of
[2:43:31] god
[2:43:32] they are the ones that are born of god
[2:43:35] they are baptized into the body of the
[2:43:37] lord jesus christ by his spirit they are
[2:43:39] baptized with the holy ghost
[2:43:43] to further bring out what we have just
[2:43:45] said
[2:43:45] and to also use a scripture that should
[2:43:47] be born in mind as we talk about who it
[2:43:49] is that is baptized with the holy ghost
[2:43:52] see what jesus says in john 6 45
[2:43:56] it is written in the prophets
[2:43:58] and they shall all be taught of god
[2:44:01] but turn to isaiah 54 13 whence this is
[2:44:04] taken and it reads
[2:44:06] and all thy children shall be taught of
[2:44:08] the lord the all of god are the children
[2:44:11] of god
[2:44:13] thus it is that the evidence of being a
[2:44:15] true child of god he whom the spirit has
[2:44:19] come upon and indwells
[2:44:21] is again set forth as one taught the
[2:44:23] word by the holy ghost
[2:44:25] now you can begin to see why tongues is
[2:44:28] not the evidence of being baptized with
[2:44:29] the holy ghost
[2:44:31] it doesn't say in any age that
[2:44:34] he that hath a tongue let him say what
[2:44:36] the spirit is saying
[2:44:38] that puts tongues interpretation thereof
[2:44:41] and prophecy etc aside as in evidence
[2:44:44] the evidence is hearing what the spirit
[2:44:46] says
[2:44:47] the spirit is talking
[2:44:49] yes the spirit is teaching
[2:44:51] that is exactly what jesus said he would
[2:44:53] do when he came
[2:44:55] john 14 26
[2:44:58] he will teach you all things and bring
[2:45:00] all things to your remembrance
[2:45:01] whatsoever i have said unto you
[2:45:05] now
[2:45:06] some people misinterpret this
[2:45:09] but the banham never said that those who
[2:45:11] have received the holy spirit should not
[2:45:15] have the manifestation thereof
[2:45:17] you understand yes but he is simply
[2:45:19] giving a disclaimer because the wrong
[2:45:22] teaching
[2:45:23] given the foster realms they say
[2:45:25] the evidence the initial evidence
[2:45:28] that someone is feeling the holy spirit
[2:45:30] is
[2:45:30] science
[2:45:32] and diverse manifestation
[2:45:34] but then he says no manifestation cannot
[2:45:36] be the initial evidence that someone has
[2:45:39] been indeed filled with the holy spirit
[2:45:43] when you receive
[2:45:45] the
[2:45:46] holy spirit
[2:45:47] he will teach you all things and bring
[2:45:50] all things to your remembrance
[2:45:51] whatsoever jesus taught
[2:45:54] so in other words he will remind you
[2:45:57] the word of god whereby your life will
[2:46:00] be a written episode
[2:46:01] your writing will be a written episode
[2:46:04] read of all men why because you have
[2:46:06] heard the word you have believed the
[2:46:08] word and then when you you receive the
[2:46:11] baptism of the holy spirit the holy
[2:46:13] spirit positions your life into
[2:46:16] obedience of every one of god that
[2:46:19] that's the proof you see that's the
[2:46:22] proof that you have him and then
[2:46:24] indeed if you have him you must manifest
[2:46:27] him
[2:46:28] if you have him you must manifest the
[2:46:30] life okay so the manifestations must be
[2:46:34] there but you must also remember that
[2:46:36] the manifestations can be there for he
[2:46:39] that is um
[2:46:41] um
[2:46:43] one who is
[2:46:45] what's the word
[2:46:48] not a genuine believer
[2:46:50] you know he can also show manifestation
[2:46:54] i'm failing to get the word i was
[2:46:55] looking for
[2:46:56] you know
[2:46:58] huh
[2:47:00] not really a mac believer but uh
[2:47:02] somebody who pretends to be a believer
[2:47:04] when they are not you know they can try
[2:47:07] to mimic these gifts and the
[2:47:09] manifestation
[2:47:10] impersonators that's what i was looking
[2:47:12] for they can impersonate these gifts
[2:47:15] all the gifts that god has in his bank
[2:47:19] the devil can impersonate it
[2:47:22] healing
[2:47:23] prophecies
[2:47:24] miracles
[2:47:26] signs
[2:47:27] wonders
[2:47:28] tongues interpretation of tongues all
[2:47:30] these the devil can imagine it
[2:47:33] okay
[2:47:34] but it doesn't take away the fact that
[2:47:37] there is also the genuine one
[2:47:40] the real one
[2:47:41] and therefore that's what we want to see
[2:47:43] in the creatures of the living god
[2:47:46] um and that is just what happened
[2:47:50] that is how the gospels were written
[2:47:52] behind by the holy ghost the very words
[2:47:55] that jesus spake
[2:47:56] that is why the gospels are accurate
[2:47:59] they are perfect
[2:48:00] but the spirit did not only bring all
[2:48:02] things to their minds but he taught them
[2:48:04] further on the truth they already had
[2:48:07] that is how paul received his
[2:48:08] revelations
[2:48:10] he said concerning it
[2:48:12] but i certify you brethren that the
[2:48:14] gospel which was preached of me is not
[2:48:16] after man
[2:48:17] for i neither received it of man neither
[2:48:19] was i taught it of man
[2:48:21] but by the revelation of jesus christ
[2:48:24] galatians 1
[2:48:26] 11-12
[2:48:28] he was taught by the holy ghost
[2:48:31] one day when jesus was upon earth a
[2:48:34] certain important man came to visit him
[2:48:36] this man said
[2:48:38] rabbi we know you are a teacher sent
[2:48:40] from god
[2:48:41] but you will notice that jesus cut him
[2:48:43] short he turned to nicodemus and the
[2:48:45] words he spoke may well be paraphrased
[2:48:47] thusly
[2:48:48] i am not a teacher
[2:48:50] i am the sacrificial lamb for sin i am
[2:48:53] making possible the new birth by my
[2:48:55] spirit
[2:48:56] but there is a coming one who is the
[2:48:58] teacher
[2:48:59] he is the holy spirit
[2:49:01] when jesus was upon the earth he came as
[2:49:04] the lamb and as the prophet
[2:49:06] but when he came back upon the church by
[2:49:08] his spirit he became the teacher
[2:49:11] and to every age we hear the same truth
[2:49:14] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[2:49:16] the spirit sayeth to the churches
[2:49:18] but only a spirit-filled man can hear
[2:49:20] the revelation for that age
[2:49:22] none other can
[2:49:24] no sir
[2:49:25] they cannot because that is exactly what
[2:49:27] paul said in 1st corinthians 2 6 through
[2:49:29] 16.
[2:49:31] now this ought to make you rejoice
[2:49:34] there is a most peculiar doctrine in the
[2:49:35] air that is causing much
[2:49:36] misunderstanding and hard feelings
[2:49:39] for when the pentecostals say you must
[2:49:41] speak in tongues or you haven't been
[2:49:43] baptized with the holy ghost they are
[2:49:45] either denying that great men like knox
[2:49:47] moody taylor go forth and others
[2:49:50] did not receive the holy ghost
[2:49:52] or saying that they all secretly spoke
[2:49:54] in tongues and were not aware of what
[2:49:56] was going on
[2:49:57] now that is not true no sir
[2:50:00] that is gross error
[2:50:02] tongues are not the evidence of being
[2:50:03] spirit-filled
[2:50:05] it is simply one of the nine
[2:50:06] manifestations mentioned in first
[2:50:08] corinthians 12
[2:50:10] there is no scripture that says you
[2:50:11] receive the holy spirit speaking in
[2:50:13] tongues or that you receive the holy
[2:50:15] spirit by speaking in tongues
[2:50:17] but it does say that
[2:50:19] after they were all filled with the holy
[2:50:21] ghost they spake in tongues
[2:50:23] and later on it says that they
[2:50:25] prophesied
[2:50:27] today amongst many folks it is taken
[2:50:30] now before we continue on this
[2:50:33] uh i thank god that this question is put
[2:50:35] in here
[2:50:37] this in here is not written for you
[2:50:42] it's written
[2:50:43] for the others
[2:50:45] that think
[2:50:47] the manifestation
[2:50:49] is an evidence of the holy spirit
[2:50:53] they
[2:50:54] the accent when you give them the truth
[2:50:56] they reject it and they claim but i have
[2:50:58] the holy spirit already
[2:51:00] why because i speak tongues because i
[2:51:03] prophesy because i preach because i have
[2:51:05] the anointing because i i i have the
[2:51:08] gift of healing you understand
[2:51:09] in this message we have been told
[2:51:12] and we know from the scripture
[2:51:15] that the manifestation of the gifts
[2:51:19] can
[2:51:20] be hard
[2:51:23] can be held by the true vine and also
[2:51:26] the force divine
[2:51:28] because in the book of jehovah he says
[2:51:30] i'll pour my spirit upon
[2:51:32] all flesh
[2:51:34] now forgetting about the impersonators
[2:51:36] there is also this aspect whereby god
[2:51:39] anoints all flesh to manifest those
[2:51:42] gifts of the spirit
[2:51:44] they might receive the gifts but it is
[2:51:46] not the sign that they are indeed
[2:51:48] baptized into the holocaust
[2:51:50] they can be
[2:51:51] they have the it's the spirit of god yes
[2:51:54] but it's it is only simply anointing
[2:51:57] their spirit but not
[2:51:59] feeling their soul that's why someone
[2:52:02] the bible says that they come to him at
[2:52:04] that day and they will say lord lord did
[2:52:06] we do this in your name lord lord didn't
[2:52:08] we
[2:52:09] heal in your name between the liver
[2:52:10] didn't because of demons did he say you
[2:52:13] did
[2:52:14] did he say you didn't
[2:52:16] what did he say instead
[2:52:19] he said go away you do as of iniquity i
[2:52:21] never knew you
[2:52:23] in other words you do iniquity meaning
[2:52:25] you know the truth of my word but you
[2:52:27] rejected it
[2:52:28] you continued being women and preachers
[2:52:30] when you know the truth
[2:52:31] you continue to refuse to bypass in my
[2:52:33] name when you saw it people have been
[2:52:35] telling you the word is telling you
[2:52:37] you refused it so you refuse the word
[2:52:39] therefore i don't want anything with you
[2:52:41] yeah i know i manifested myself through
[2:52:43] you but that doesn't mean that you are
[2:52:44] mine i do not know you i don't own you
[2:52:47] you are not i'm not in you you
[2:52:49] understand but you had my gifts but i'm
[2:52:52] not in you it's like you young man if
[2:52:53] you want to marry somebody and you give
[2:52:55] gift here you give gift there give that
[2:52:57] it's not necessarily that whatever you
[2:52:58] give a gift to your money you know
[2:53:01] so usually you will choose one among all
[2:53:04] of them you know
[2:53:05] you know so it's also a story of esther
[2:53:08] you know it's a very good story how the
[2:53:09] others receive gifts but one of them
[2:53:12] becomes the wife only you know so but
[2:53:15] for you believers you know better for us
[2:53:17] believers we know better that
[2:53:19] manifestation must be a part of a true
[2:53:21] church
[2:53:22] incidentally and sadly
[2:53:25] some believers take portions like this
[2:53:27] and they must teach the people
[2:53:29] as if by the battle was against the
[2:53:30] manifestation of the spirit
[2:53:32] as if it was against the manifestation
[2:53:35] of the
[2:53:36] gifts of the holy spirit and using
[2:53:38] quotes like this but now you know
[2:53:42] granted that all who claim to receive
[2:53:44] the holy ghost by speaking in tongues
[2:53:46] speak in a genuine spiritual tongue
[2:53:49] but this is not so for many people speak
[2:53:51] in a known tongue but under the
[2:53:52] influence of a wrong spirit
[2:53:55] now let's say we are in a meeting and
[2:53:56] people are all speaking in tongues
[2:53:59] how can you know which tongue is from
[2:54:01] the spirit and which is from the devil
[2:54:03] i have been amongst the heathen where
[2:54:05] their wizards drank blood out of a skull
[2:54:07] spoke in tongues and interpreted and
[2:54:09] prophesied
[2:54:10] they can even write in tongues
[2:54:13] now if tongues is the evidence of
[2:54:15] receiving the holy ghost then every
[2:54:17] tongue would have to be of god
[2:54:19] but it has been admitted by tongues
[2:54:21] evidence people that there are false and
[2:54:23] true tongues for god has the genuine and
[2:54:25] satan has the false
[2:54:27] so my question is who knows what is real
[2:54:31] who understood the language to know what
[2:54:33] was spoken who has the gift of
[2:54:35] discernment to know
[2:54:37] now when we get those answers we will
[2:54:39] have something to go on but until then
[2:54:42] we have to wonder about the source of
[2:54:43] the tongues
[2:54:45] you can see right now that if you back
[2:54:47] up a tongue's evidence and don't know
[2:54:48] what is being said
[2:54:50] you have to finally come to the place
[2:54:52] where all tongues have to be of god
[2:54:55] that would lead us then to believe that
[2:54:56] the devil cannot speak in tongues
[2:54:58] that is not so no not for a minute any
[2:55:02] true missionary on a foreign field knows
[2:55:04] only too well that devils speak in other
[2:55:06] tongues the same as i know it by
[2:55:08] experience
[2:55:10] pentecostal theologians admit that they
[2:55:12] have no scripture setting forth that
[2:55:14] people speak with tongues when baptized
[2:55:16] by the holy ghost
[2:55:17] they admit that they infer it from the
[2:55:19] experiences set forth in the book of
[2:55:21] acts
[2:55:22] wherein three out of five times the
[2:55:24] people spoke with tongues
[2:55:26] and they also say without any scripture
[2:55:28] that there are two kinds
[2:55:34] the tongue you speak in while receiving
[2:55:36] the holy ghost and it is the evidence
[2:55:37] while later on if you believe you can
[2:55:39] receive the gift of tongues whereby you
[2:55:40] may speak often
[2:55:42] however they say once having spoken in
[2:55:44] tongues as the evidence of receiving you
[2:55:46] may never speak again
[2:55:48] once more we are anxious to know where
[2:55:50] this is found in the word
[2:55:52] if it isn't there then god hath not
[2:55:54] spoken it and woe unto him who would add
[2:55:56] to that word
[2:55:58] but there is something in the word about
[2:56:00] this very subject that they ignore
[2:56:02] completely
[2:56:03] first corinthians 13
[2:56:06] it mentions tongues of men and angels
[2:56:09] these would be known and unknown tongues
[2:56:11] modern pentecostals say that they can
[2:56:13] receive the holy ghost speaking in
[2:56:15] unknown or angelic tongues
[2:56:17] they have the card before the horse for
[2:56:19] in acts 2 the people spoke in a perfect
[2:56:26] [Music]
[2:56:33] now when god is silent we had better be
[2:56:35] silent
[2:56:36] but where he has spoken we had better
[2:56:38] speak too
[2:56:39] and say what he has already said
[2:56:42] he told us the evidence or what would
[2:56:44] happen after being baptized with the
[2:56:45] holy ghost was that we would have the
[2:56:48] teacher come and teach all truth
[2:56:50] but that teacher was an inside teacher
[2:56:52] not an outside teacher
[2:56:54] if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't
[2:56:56] hear the truth and receive it by
[2:56:58] revelation if you heard it every moment
[2:57:00] of the day
[2:57:01] that was the sign of the indwelling
[2:57:03] spirit in the days of paul
[2:57:05] those who were filled with the holy
[2:57:06] ghost heard the word
[2:57:08] received it and lived by it
[2:57:10] those who did not have the spirit heard
[2:57:12] it only as carnal men put a wrong
[2:57:15] interpretation on it and went into sin
[2:57:18] in every age and every age is the age of
[2:57:21] the holy ghost for the true believer
[2:57:23] i say in every age the evidence was the
[2:57:25] same
[2:57:27] those who had the spirit the teacher
[2:57:29] heard the word and that spirit in them
[2:57:31] took the word and taught it revealed it
[2:57:33] to them
[2:57:35] and they were of the group that heard
[2:57:36] the messenger and his message and took
[2:57:38] it and lived it
[2:57:40] i know it is a great temptation to refer
[2:57:42] back to the day of pentecost and also to
[2:57:45] the day when the holy ghost fell in the
[2:57:46] house of cornelius and then set those
[2:57:49] two identical experiences as the
[2:57:50] evidence of the baptism with the holy
[2:57:52] ghost
[2:57:54] but on each occasion the tongues were
[2:57:56] understood by the listeners
[2:57:58] this is a far cry from the modern battle
[2:58:00] of confusion of pentecostal meetings
[2:58:03] and if this were not enough to persuade
[2:58:05] us to leave off such reasoning
[2:58:08] what will we do when we are con
[2:58:11] fronted with the fact that people who
[2:58:13] have never spoken in tongues have some
[2:58:14] of the other eight manifestations in
[2:58:16] their lives such as word of wisdom the
[2:58:19] discerning of spirits a word of
[2:58:21] knowledge faith healing and even
[2:58:23] miracles
[2:58:24] and this observation is even more
[2:58:26] you cannot at least
[2:58:29] manifest
[2:58:31] if you're filled with the holy ghost
[2:58:33] i told you the other day
[2:58:35] you must manifest one of the
[2:58:37] manifestations
[2:58:40] you cannot just say you have the holy
[2:58:42] spirit and you are dry
[2:58:45] you he came to you when you are just dry
[2:58:48] you don't even know when you received
[2:58:49] him
[2:58:50] and you are just there no but you have
[2:58:52] it
[2:58:53] it is not true
[2:58:58] he said that people that never spoke in
[2:59:01] tongues
[2:59:02] they have some other eight
[2:59:03] manifestations in their lives but
[2:59:05] abandonment is trying to insist
[2:59:07] that yeah
[2:59:08] it's not true to say that the
[2:59:11] only evidence that someone has the holy
[2:59:13] spirit he's speaking in tongues
[2:59:16] you might as well not speak in tongues
[2:59:17] but you can have another
[2:59:19] manifestation he gives examples
[2:59:22] with word of wisdom designing of spirits
[2:59:26] word of knowledge faith
[2:59:28] healing
[2:59:29] miracles you know prophecies and stuff
[2:59:31] like that
[2:59:32] so
[2:59:34] the manifestation is many
[2:59:37] and when you receive the holy spirit
[2:59:41] he surely surely must manifest himself
[2:59:46] he's not a silent
[2:59:48] person if he comes in you
[2:59:50] he's not a silent person
[2:59:52] he comes to you like he's a quiet quiet
[2:59:55] person no he's not
[2:59:56] he speaks
[2:59:58] just like you
[2:59:59] you speak also even if you're silent you
[3:00:00] still speak
[3:00:02] so how come you tell me that christ
[3:00:05] comes in you and is silent from
[3:00:06] beginning to the end
[3:00:08] nothing happens
[3:00:10] there is nothing nothing but you have
[3:00:12] the holy spirit
[3:00:14] yeah the holy spirit
[3:00:19] the holy spirit
[3:00:21] these things are shouting these things
[3:00:22] of
[3:00:24] word of faith knowledge miracles
[3:00:27] speaking in tongues designing of spirits
[3:00:29] all these kind of manifestations because
[3:00:31] i for pentecostals but i have their
[3:00:33] spirit
[3:00:35] brother and sister
[3:00:37] that holy spirit of yours
[3:00:39] i don't
[3:00:40] identify anyone in the bible with it
[3:00:43] so you need to find out your roots
[3:00:45] what type of spirit is
[3:00:48] do you understand what i'm saying
[3:00:50] and by the banana continues to explain
[3:00:52] this part as he continues on down we our
[3:00:54] time is done but let us
[3:00:56] add a button to see what he says
[3:00:59] interesting in the light that tongues is
[3:01:01] the least of the nine gifts
[3:01:03] so when we see people who do not nor
[3:01:05] ever have spoken entire gifts than those
[3:01:08] who do speak in tongues
[3:01:09] we must discount such a doctrine even
[3:01:11] more completely than before
[3:01:14] so you can see now that we cannot afford
[3:01:17] to say what the bible has not said
[3:01:19] when scripture teaches us that the work
[3:01:21] of the holy spirit and the manifestation
[3:01:23] of that blessed person is to bring the
[3:01:25] truth of each age to the true seed of
[3:01:27] that age
[3:01:28] then we know that the spirit has to be
[3:01:30] abiding in the person or he cannot
[3:01:32] receive the truth for that time amen
[3:01:36] that is exactly correct
[3:01:38] and if these ages bring out anything
[3:01:40] they surely bring and bear out this
[3:01:41] truth
[3:01:43] now before we leave this subject i want
[3:01:45] to make myself very clear on what the
[3:01:47] baptism with the holy ghost is according
[3:01:49] to the word
[3:01:50] it is not according to me and it is not
[3:01:53] according to you
[3:01:54] it has to be according to thus saith the
[3:01:57] lord or we are falsely led
[3:02:00] amen
[3:02:01] to begin with you will notice that in my
[3:02:03] meetings when i have finished preaching
[3:02:05] an evangelistic service or some teaching
[3:02:07] message i cast the net and invite a
[3:02:09] response from the people
[3:02:11] i ask them to come forward and receive
[3:02:13] the holy spirit
[3:02:15] my pentecostal friends upon hearing me
[3:02:17] say this believe that i am inviting
[3:02:19] people to come forward to be baptized
[3:02:21] with the holy ghost because they are
[3:02:22] already born again
[3:02:24] so when i invite those who are
[3:02:26] spirit-filled to come and deal with
[3:02:27] those who have answered the invitation
[3:02:29] to receive the spirit
[3:02:31] these dear ones surge forward and deal
[3:02:33] with the people in such manner as to
[3:02:34] encourage them to yield to god and
[3:02:37] believe to speak in tongues
[3:02:39] this has caused a great deal of
[3:02:41] confusion
[3:02:42] and i want to tell you exactly what i
[3:02:44] mean
[3:02:45] i mean for the sinner to come forward
[3:02:47] and be born again
[3:02:48] which is to be baptized into the body of
[3:02:50] christ by the holy ghost which is
[3:02:52] exactly what took place at pentecost
[3:02:54] when the church was launched
[3:02:56] in other words to be born of the spirit
[3:02:58] is to be truly baptized with the holy
[3:03:00] ghost
[3:03:02] it is one and the same
[3:03:04] now i realize that it is going to be
[3:03:06] confusing for a moment here as most
[3:03:08] people know that i was ordained a
[3:03:10] baptist preacher and i have steadfastly
[3:03:12] declared that the baptists have missed
[3:03:14] it for saying you receive the holy ghost
[3:03:16] when you believe for that is not so
[3:03:19] you receive him since you believed acts
[3:03:22] 19
[3:03:24] 2-6 which says that when you receive the
[3:03:27] holy spirit you when you believe you
[3:03:29] have received the holy spirit already
[3:03:30] this is the first teaching
[3:03:33] i didn't hear anyone amen
[3:03:35] some of you believe me
[3:03:40] that kind of doctrine will say that you
[3:03:43] receive the holy spirit when you believe
[3:03:45] the message is a false doctrine
[3:03:48] it's a false teaching
[3:03:50] but a solomon
[3:03:51] have you not read
[3:03:53] you want to read with your own mouth
[3:03:55] please go ahead
[3:03:59] read it
[3:04:01] yes that question now i realize
[3:04:21] that the baptists have
[3:04:25] for say what did they say
[3:04:28] that you
[3:04:30] receive
[3:04:31] the word goes when
[3:04:33] for that is not
[3:04:39] since you believe meaning there must be
[3:04:41] a time after believing yes you receive
[3:04:44] him
[3:04:44] hallelujah not when he doesn't come as a
[3:04:47] full package when you believe that when
[3:04:49] you accept the message
[3:04:50] you have also received the holy spirit
[3:04:52] no
[3:04:53] after believing then you must receive
[3:04:56] the holy spirit hallelujah
[3:04:59] that's the right teaching of the word
[3:05:01] okay
[3:05:03] have you received the holy ghost since
[3:05:05] he believed
[3:05:07] and they said unto him
[3:05:08] we have not so much as heard whether
[3:05:10] there be any holy ghost
[3:05:12] and he said unto them unto what then
[3:05:15] were ye baptized
[3:05:16] and they said unto john's baptism
[3:05:19] then said paul
[3:05:21] john verily baptized with the baptism of
[3:05:23] repentance saying unto the people that
[3:05:25] they should believe on him which should
[3:05:27] come after him that is on christ jesus
[3:05:31] when they heard this they were baptized
[3:05:32] in the name of the lord jesus
[3:05:35] and when paul had laid his hands upon
[3:05:37] them the holy ghost came upon them
[3:05:39] and they spake with tongues and
[3:05:41] prophesied
[3:05:42] there it is
[3:05:44] paul asked
[3:05:45] have you received since not when you
[3:05:48] believed
[3:05:49] and there is a great difference there
[3:05:50] for it is after we believe that we
[3:05:52] receive
[3:05:54] ephesians 1 13
[3:05:56] is an exact word repeat of what happened
[3:05:58] in ephesus according to acts 19
[3:06:00] in whom ye also trusted
[3:06:03] after that ye heard the word of truth
[3:06:05] the gospel of your salvation
[3:06:07] in whom also after that ye believed not
[3:06:11] when ye believed ye were sealed with
[3:06:13] that holy spirit of promise
[3:06:16] now here is my point
[3:06:18] too many of our modernists and even our
[3:06:20] fundamentalists so-called
[3:06:23] believe unto salvation at a certain
[3:06:24] specific time which in many cases is
[3:06:27] called making a decision
[3:06:29] and that has been called receiving
[3:06:31] christ or being born again
[3:06:33] now to receive christ is to receive his
[3:06:35] spirit
[3:06:36] to receive his spirit is to be born
[3:06:38] again
[3:06:39] to receive his spirit is to be baptized
[3:06:41] with the holy ghost
[3:06:43] amen these folks believe
[3:06:46] that is wonderful
[3:06:47] but they stop there
[3:06:49] you receive the holy ghost after you
[3:06:51] believe
[3:06:52] it has always been that way and always
[3:06:54] will be the very first word of direction
[3:06:57] to the people was by peter at pentecost
[3:06:59] and he said
[3:07:01] repent and be baptized every one of you
[3:07:03] in the name of jesus christ for the
[3:07:05] remission of sins and you shall receive
[3:07:07] the gift of the holy ghost for the
[3:07:10] promise is unto you and to your children
[3:07:12] and to all that are afar off
[3:07:15] even as many as the lord our god shall
[3:07:17] call
[3:07:19] these directions came as a direct answer
[3:07:21] from peter relative to what had actually
[3:07:23] happened at pentecost
[3:07:25] what came to pass was that god according
[3:07:27] to joel was pouring out the promised
[3:07:29] holy spirit upon all flesh
[3:07:32] he was not poured out before that time
[3:07:34] or given before that time
[3:07:36] this was it
[3:07:37] but this was to come from now on by
[3:07:39] repenting being baptized in the name of
[3:07:42] the lord jesus christ
[3:07:44] and then god was duty bound to fill the
[3:07:46] ones who came
[3:07:48] peter or any of the apostles never said
[3:07:51] you must be born again and then filled
[3:07:53] with the spirit
[3:07:55] that this is the pattern of experience
[3:07:57] relative to receiving the holy spirit
[3:07:59] note carefully the very next time that
[3:08:01] the spirit fell upon a people
[3:08:03] acts 8
[3:08:04] 5-17
[3:08:06] then philip went down to the city of
[3:08:08] samaria and preached christ unto them
[3:08:11] and the people with one accord gave heed
[3:08:13] unto those things which philip spake
[3:08:15] hearing and seeing the miracles which he
[3:08:17] did
[3:08:18] for unclean spirits crying with loud
[3:08:20] voice came out of many that were
[3:08:22] possessed with them
[3:08:23] and many taken with palsies and that
[3:08:26] were lame were healed
[3:08:28] and there was great joy in that city
[3:08:30] but there was a certain man called simon
[3:08:32] which before time in the same city used
[3:08:34] sorcery and bewitched the people of
[3:08:36] samaria giving out that himself was some
[3:08:39] great one
[3:08:40] to whom they all gave heed from the
[3:08:42] least to the greatest saying
[3:08:44] this man is the great power of god
[3:08:47] and to him they had regard because that
[3:08:49] of long time he had bewitched them with
[3:08:51] sorceries
[3:08:53] but when they believed philip preaching
[3:08:54] the things concerning the kingdom of god
[3:08:56] and the name of jesus christ they were
[3:08:58] baptized both men and
[3:09:00] women then simon himself believed also
[3:09:04] and when he was baptized he continued
[3:09:06] with philip
[3:09:07] and wandered beholding the miracles and
[3:09:10] signs which were done
[3:09:11] now when the apostles which were at
[3:09:13] jerusalem heard that samaria had
[3:09:14] received the word of god
[3:09:16] they said unto them peter and john
[3:09:18] who when they were come down prayed for
[3:09:20] them that they might receive the holy
[3:09:22] ghost
[3:09:23] for as yet he was fallen upon none of
[3:09:25] them only they were baptized in the name
[3:09:27] of the lord jesus
[3:09:29] then laid they their hands on them and
[3:09:31] they received the holy ghost
[3:09:34] according to verse 12 they believed the
[3:09:36] word
[3:09:37] they were then baptized in the name of
[3:09:39] the lord jesus
[3:09:40] but according to verse 16 in spite of
[3:09:43] all that they had still not received the
[3:09:45] holy spirit
[3:09:47] it was only after believing and being
[3:09:48] baptized correctly but they received the
[3:09:51] holy ghost
[3:09:52] that is the exact pattern is set forth
[3:09:54] by peter in acts 2
[3:09:56] 38-39
[3:09:58] another scripture that casts wondrous
[3:10:00] light on this is found in galatians 3
[3:10:02] 13-14
[3:10:05] cursed is everyone that hangeth on a
[3:10:07] tree
[3:10:08] that the blessing of abraham might come
[3:10:09] on the gentiles through jesus christ
[3:10:12] that in order that we might receive the
[3:10:14] promise of the spirit through faith
[3:10:17] now by no means can it be said that the
[3:10:19] blessing of abraham is the rebirth and
[3:10:21] that the promise of the spirit is the
[3:10:24] baptism with the holy ghost as two
[3:10:26] separate events
[3:10:27] for the scripture reads thus
[3:10:30] jesus died on the cross and by means of
[3:10:32] that death and resurrection the blessing
[3:10:34] of abraham came on the gentiles leaving
[3:10:37] the jews
[3:10:38] this transpired in order that the spirit
[3:10:40] might become available to the gentiles
[3:10:44] to understand what i have just said is
[3:10:46] to clear up why students have never ever
[3:10:48] found paul saying at any time
[3:10:51] be born again and then be
[3:10:53] filled
[3:10:54] they have inferred it is there and they
[3:10:56] have put their own meanings to make it
[3:10:58] say it but scripture does not say that
[3:11:02] jesus never said it either
[3:11:04] look at john 7 37-39
[3:11:07] and read it now with understanding
[3:11:10] in the last day that great day of the
[3:11:12] feast jesus stood and cried saying if
[3:11:15] any man thirst let him come unto me and
[3:11:18] drink
[3:11:19] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[3:11:21] hath said
[3:11:22] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[3:11:24] living water
[3:11:26] but this spake he of the spirit
[3:11:28] which they that believe on him should
[3:11:30] receive for the holy ghost was not yet
[3:11:32] given
[3:11:33] because that jesus was not yet glorified
[3:11:36] now it says here distinctly and
[3:11:38] emphatically that the believer upon
[3:11:40] drinking by coming unto jesus in faith
[3:11:42] would have rivers of living waters
[3:11:44] pouring out of him
[3:11:46] and it places this experience at
[3:11:47] pentecost
[3:11:49] now keeping this thought in mind we read
[3:11:51] john 4 10 and 14
[3:11:54] if thou knewest the gift of god and who
[3:11:57] it is that saith to thee give me to
[3:11:58] drink thou wouldst have asked of him and
[3:12:01] he would have given thee living water
[3:12:04] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[3:12:06] i shall give him shall never thirst
[3:12:08] but the water that i shall give him
[3:12:10] shall be in him a well of water
[3:12:12] springing up into everlasting life
[3:12:15] this same living water is mentioned but
[3:12:17] this time it is not called a river it is
[3:12:20] called an artesian well
[3:12:22] there is where the people make their
[3:12:24] mistake
[3:12:25] because it is called a well and a river
[3:12:27] they think that in one place it is
[3:12:29] eternal life given by the spirit and in
[3:12:32] the next place where it is called a
[3:12:33] river implying a great dynamism
[3:12:36] it has to be the spirit now given as an
[3:12:38] endowment of power
[3:12:40] not so
[3:12:41] it is one and the same
[3:12:43] it is the spirit that gives life and
[3:12:45] power and that came at pentecost
[3:12:48] what is it that caused this
[3:12:50] misunderstanding
[3:12:51] the answer is
[3:12:53] experience
[3:12:55] we have gone by experience and not the
[3:12:57] word
[3:12:58] away with experience as your measuring
[3:13:00] line
[3:13:01] there is only one plumb line only one
[3:13:03] rod and that is the word
[3:13:05] now watch carefully and get this
[3:13:08] peter said
[3:13:09] repent and be baptized in the name of
[3:13:11] jesus christ for the remission of sin
[3:13:13] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[3:13:15] holy ghost
[3:13:16] paul said
[3:13:18] have you received the holy ghost since
[3:13:20] he believed
[3:13:21] this is the whole of our problem right
[3:13:23] here
[3:13:24] people repent of their sins they get
[3:13:26] baptized in water but they don't go on
[3:13:28] and receive the holy ghost
[3:13:30] you believe unto receiving the spirit
[3:13:33] believing on jesus is the step in the
[3:13:35] right direction which is toward the holy
[3:13:37] ghost
[3:13:38] but the people stop there they go as far
[3:13:41] as water and then stop
[3:13:43] they believe and then stop
[3:13:45] the bible does not say that you receive
[3:13:47] when you believe it is
[3:13:49] have you received the holy ghost since
[3:13:51] you believed
[3:13:53] the exact and literal translation is
[3:13:55] did ye having previously believed
[3:13:57] receive the holy ghost
[3:13:59] the people believe and then stop
[3:14:02] you don't receive the holy ghost when
[3:14:03] you believe unto him having repented
[3:14:06] you go on and receive the holy ghost
[3:14:08] do you see it that is what is wrong with
[3:14:11] our fundamentalists they have no power
[3:14:13] for they stop short of pentecost
[3:14:16] they are like the children of israel who
[3:14:18] came out of egypt and stopped short of
[3:14:19] the promised land
[3:14:21] hallelujah
[3:14:23] that's why you know all things are by
[3:14:25] faith
[3:14:26] everything is by faith
[3:14:28] even what we are doing years by day
[3:14:31] when you go to pray you pray and believe
[3:14:33] that you will receive
[3:14:35] you know so just like let me ask a
[3:14:38] question sometimes we are closing
[3:14:40] this
[3:14:43] how many believe that their sins are
[3:14:44] forgiven
[3:14:47] how many are not sure
[3:14:53] how many are going to heaven
[3:14:56] how many are not sure
[3:15:00] what if someone was to confirm to you
[3:15:04] and tell you for sure
[3:15:06] they know you very well they know what
[3:15:08] you did and therefore you are still a
[3:15:09] sinner
[3:15:11] and all your sins are still on you
[3:15:13] what would you tell them
[3:15:21] they would say when did it happen where
[3:15:23] are you there
[3:15:27] at calvary
[3:15:28] how did it happen
[3:15:39] so he died because of your sins so if he
[3:15:41] died because of your sins were you there
[3:15:43] now how come that you say that you
[3:15:44] forgive your sins
[3:15:59] you believe it by faith period
[3:16:03] otherwise whatever you are saying
[3:16:04] someone will reason you out
[3:16:07] someone will risen you out
[3:16:09] therefore you believe by faith and you
[3:16:11] strongly believe by faith that you are
[3:16:14] forgiven
[3:16:15] your sins are washed away
[3:16:17] and when you repented you believed
[3:16:20] it has happened and it will happen yes
[3:16:23] not so yes in the same way you should
[3:16:25] master this in the holy spirit
[3:16:28] when you pray to receive the words
[3:16:30] believe you receive him
[3:16:32] not you might or may that you will
[3:16:34] receive him yes hallelujah remember
[3:16:37] before you got baptized and believed
[3:16:40] there was an atmosphere for you to
[3:16:42] believe
[3:16:44] and that atmosphere you created it
[3:16:47] you avail the time
[3:16:49] the willingness and the desire
[3:16:52] and the readiness to receive
[3:16:54] and you received the same way it has to
[3:16:57] be with the holy spirit
[3:16:59] the desire the readiness the
[3:17:01] availability that you you are
[3:17:02] availability your willingness to
[3:17:04] surrender everything else and live and
[3:17:06] forsake it
[3:17:07] and yield yourself to god then he
[3:17:10] must feed you with the holy spirit that
[3:17:12] is part of the change
[3:17:13] hallelujah
[3:17:16] can i have someone to close
[3:17:19] someone come on
[3:17:21] we are ready 19 minutes within our time
[3:17:25] past our time so
