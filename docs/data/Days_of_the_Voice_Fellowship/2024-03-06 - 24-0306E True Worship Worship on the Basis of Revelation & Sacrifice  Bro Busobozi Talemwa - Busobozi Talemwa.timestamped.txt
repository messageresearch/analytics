[47:01] tonight amen I'm also happy
[47:04] tonight our fathers woried in this
[47:06] mountain and he said that in Jerusalem
[47:08] is the place where men ought to worship
[47:11] Jesus said unto her woman believe me the
[47:14] hour cometh when you shall neither in
[47:16] this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem
[47:18] worship the father ye worship ye know
[47:21] not what we know what we worship for
[47:23] salvation is of the Jews but how cometh
[47:26] and now is when the two worshippers
[47:28] shall worship the father in spirit and
[47:29] in truth for the father seeketh such to
[47:31] worship him God is a spirit and they
[47:34] that worship Him must worship Him in
[47:36] spirit and in
[47:54] truth
[48:24] for
[48:30] amen you may be
[48:32] seated so I'm speaking to you today on
[48:35] the subject of true
[48:41] worship and um uh my inspiration is
[48:44] worship upon the basis of Revelation and
[48:49] [Music]
[48:54] sacrifice I've taken this uh scripture
[48:59] from the
[49:02] middle but most of us of course we've
[49:04] read the scriptures many times so we
[49:05] know how it
[49:09] starts it's a very familiar
[49:13] scripture this is the time when Jesus
[49:15] sends his disciples to go and buy
[49:20] meat as if to say 11 12 men cannot I
[49:24] mean have to buy a Kil two kilog of
[49:30] meat but Jesus the Bible says he must
[49:32] needs pass through
[49:38] Samaria you know God does not do
[49:40] anything by
[49:42] accident everything that God does is by
[49:47] Design none of us is a Believer by
[49:51] accident a Believer by
[49:54] Design we are a Believer by
[49:58] predestination God knew us before the
[50:00] foundation of the
[50:02] world and he knew that we would be here
[50:06] today he knew what type of cloth you
[50:08] would wear
[50:10] today he knew what type of color of the
[50:13] hair you would
[50:15] have how much hair you would
[50:18] have even knows the number of the hair
[50:20] on your
[50:22] head he even knows how many eyelids you
[50:25] have
[50:27] he even knows what you are currently
[50:30] thinking in your
[50:32] heart he knows he knew you would be here
[50:35] he knew You' be called a Believer
[50:38] today and he has set everything for
[50:41] you to follow according to his forign
[50:45] knowledge and so we are not here by
[50:48] accident but we are here to fulfill the
[50:50] purpose of
[50:52] God and that the devil cannot Hinder
[50:57] there's one more there's one important
[50:58] thing is for a human being to be in the
[51:00] will of
[51:05] God you will always accomplish the
[51:07] purpose of
[51:10] God whether it be good or whether it be
[51:13] bad that happens to you you will realize
[51:17] it will all work for
[51:20] good so the only thing you have to do
[51:22] that I have to do is to make sure that
[51:24] I'm in the will of God
[51:29] so if I know I am in the will of
[51:31] God then I am
[51:34] rested because I know that all is going
[51:36] to work for
[51:37] my and being in
[51:39] church I am in the whe of God so I know
[51:43] all is going to work for good
[51:44] today and I know I am working right
[51:47] where I am supposed to
[51:49] be so hearing what I'm hearing this
[51:53] evening God knew would hear the sound of
[51:55] my
[51:57] voice it is not me but God knew he would
[52:00] use my voice
[52:03] today that you would hear what he has to
[52:05] say to
[52:07] you and so God also knew you would open
[52:09] your
[52:11] heart and even going to hard it he knew
[52:14] you would Harden
[52:17] it but I know he knows that I would open
[52:20] my heart
[52:22] this praise the name of the Lord so he
[52:25] knew that he had to go through
[52:29] Samaria at such a time as that because
[52:32] there was a
[52:33] woman that was in trouble a woman that
[52:37] thought she was a
[52:40] worshiper but she was not a true
[52:43] worshiper and so God knew her before the
[52:46] foundation of the
[52:48] world and he knew how to find
[52:51] her isn't it wonderful to know that God
[52:53] knows how to find his own
[52:58] and so as a
[52:59] Jew Jesus wasn't supposed to meet this
[53:01] Samaritan
[53:04] woman but you see he he he told you know
[53:08] there was a bad blood between the
[53:10] Samaritans and the
[53:15] Jews because Samaritans were not
[53:17] considered to be pure
[53:22] Jews because during the time when Israel
[53:25] was under Babylon you know the king of
[53:27] Assyria sent a lot of U A lot of people
[53:30] to
[53:37] Samaria and so many of these uh people
[53:40] who came to Samaria then they
[53:42] intermarried with the
[53:46] Jews and then out of it came the tribe
[53:49] of the
[53:52] Samaritans so now these were not pure
[53:54] Jews
[53:56] and they were also not pure
[54:00] Gentiles and so the Jews did not like
[54:03] them because they were like the uh they
[54:07] were mul they were they were
[54:09] [Music]
[54:11] mixed they were not
[54:14] genuine so they had other false
[54:18] gods but they also worshiped the god of
[54:21] Israel so you can see that they were
[54:23] mixed up because and many other reasons
[54:26] the Jews didn't like
[54:29] them and so Jesus had 11 12
[54:34] disciples and all of them did not like
[54:36] the
[54:38] Samaritans and so he knew I cannot meet
[54:41] this Samaritan
[54:44] woman if I have all my disciples with
[54:47] me and in case God has a
[54:51] rule God has a rule that he does not
[54:54] meet a Jew and a gentile at the same
[54:59] time if you read in the Book of
[55:02] Romans chapter 11 he explains the whole
[55:06] thing how he he has to Blind the
[55:10] Jews in order to Open the Eyes of the
[55:14] Gentiles and and right now the eyes of
[55:18] the Jews are
[55:19] blinded they were the the branch which
[55:22] was cut
[55:24] off
[55:26] and we were grafted
[55:28] on and the Bible says we should not also
[55:32] Bast because they were the original
[55:35] Branch if they were cut off because of
[55:39] unbelief then how much more the one
[55:41] which is not the
[55:44] original that is why there is only one
[55:46] thing which can save
[55:48] us from being cut off of that Olive
[55:52] Tree and that is faith we should keep
[55:55] believing the
[55:57] word and so Jesus laid away all the
[56:02] Jews why because Jesus was not a Jew and
[56:07] Jesus was not a gentile so in many ways
[56:11] he was like this Samaritan woman but he
[56:15] was also not
[56:16] Samaritan so you know Jesus was gone he
[56:21] was not Jew he was not
[56:22] gen he was not white he was not
[56:25] black actually it is say that even Jesus
[56:28] at that time he had a darker
[56:34] skin like the people of that time they
[56:38] were not white so Jesus was not a white
[56:42] man if anything he looked close to to to
[56:45] my
[56:49] skin but he was not black
[56:51] either but one thing that I know his
[56:55] Gene was a gene of
[56:58] God Jesus was God and he came down to
[57:02] the world to save the perishing he came
[57:06] to redeem the Sinners amen he came to
[57:09] bring
[57:10] Salvation he came to restore through
[57:14] worship because only God can be
[57:18] worship and so he now had to let aside
[57:21] all the all the
[57:23] Jews
[57:25] and then after he laid them
[57:27] off he could now meet the Samaritan
[57:31] woman and you know this Samaritan woman
[57:35] she went to the well at
[57:37] midday and that was a bad
[57:41] time considered for
[57:44] prostitutes because good women usually
[57:47] went in the in Dawn in the dawn the
[57:52] morning and and so a protitute would not
[57:55] mix up with
[57:57] them so she would they would always go
[58:00] much
[58:02] later so we don't know for sure whether
[58:04] she was a
[58:06] prostitute but one thing we can tell
[58:08] that by the time she went to the
[58:12] well she must have been one of
[58:15] them most likely a
[58:18] prostitute I want you to see something
[58:20] here Jesus knew what he was going for
[58:25] are you hearing me so when Jesus called
[58:28] you out of the
[58:30] world he knew what he was going
[58:33] for don't ever let the devil tell you
[58:36] that you are not good
[58:39] enough don't let the devil tell you that
[58:42] God cannot appreciate you well
[58:45] enough because he called me he knew what
[58:48] he
[58:50] called because he called me he loved me
[58:54] before he called me amen he he crossed
[58:58] all
[59:00] boundaries to get where the woman
[59:03] was oh come on church amenu I they feel
[59:07] good about this Jesus cross all
[59:10] boundaries to get to where I
[59:13] was amen and he called me out and here I
[59:17] am today and so when the Bible says I am
[59:21] spotless I believe it when the Bible
[59:25] says I'm a true
[59:26] worshiper I believe it no matter what
[59:29] the devil
[59:30] think why because when he called me he
[59:34] cross all
[59:36] boundaries to get to where I
[59:38] was and Jesus
[59:41] declared that they the
[59:43] Samaritans did not actually know what
[59:45] they
[59:48] worshiped so every you know you need to
[59:51] understand that they were mixed up in
[59:55] their worship they had a mountain that
[59:57] they thought that they were meeting
[59:58] their
[1:00:01] God but yet they retained other gods
[1:00:03] that
[1:00:06] they and every one of
[1:00:08] us before we came to a place of
[1:00:11] Revelation and
[1:00:15] sacrifice we actually did not
[1:00:18] know what we
[1:00:21] worship the how for two
[1:00:23] worshippers
[1:00:26] cometh and now
[1:00:29] is I pray that the holy spirit will make
[1:00:31] this real to
[1:00:32] us and so Jesus looks at the woman and
[1:00:36] of course this was after he had told her
[1:00:37] all the secrets of our
[1:00:40] heart he had told her how she he said go
[1:00:43] bring me he said fetch me a
[1:00:46] drink and the woman said how can you
[1:00:50] speak to me being you being a gentile
[1:00:52] and you being a Jew and me being
[1:00:57] and then Jesus said if you knew who was
[1:00:59] speaking to
[1:01:01] you you would know that I would give you
[1:01:03] the the water that I would give
[1:01:06] you you will never thir again if you
[1:01:10] drink of it I wish the whole world
[1:01:13] knew what Jesus brought to the
[1:01:16] world the moment you drink of
[1:01:19] it you can never
[1:01:22] thir let me tell you if you're still
[1:01:25] thirsting after the things of the world
[1:01:29] are you hearing me if you're still
[1:01:31] thirsting after those old
[1:01:34] movies if you're still thirsting after
[1:01:37] you
[1:01:38] know you know the games of the
[1:01:41] world your heart is still
[1:01:44] thirsting after
[1:01:46] alcohol after Birds after fornication
[1:01:50] after you know all the the sins and the
[1:01:52] things that are in the world if you
[1:01:55] still thirsting after
[1:01:58] makeup
[1:01:59] makeup if you still some believers they
[1:02:02] saying that Believers they're still
[1:02:03] thirsting after
[1:02:07] makeup some
[1:02:10] sisters even very good
[1:02:12] sisters they will say they will not use
[1:02:15] red red
[1:02:17] lipstick because that is like a painted
[1:02:19] face
[1:02:21] Jezebel but they get that kind of other
[1:02:23] lipstick
[1:02:26] and you find each
[1:02:27] time they
[1:02:29] applying in church they applying the
[1:02:32] preer is preaching and they
[1:02:34] applying you you are still
[1:02:37] thirsting did you not know that the more
[1:02:39] you use that stuff the more your body
[1:02:41] will thirst after
[1:02:45] it you even find men you doing that kind
[1:02:48] of
[1:02:49] things I'm telling you these are
[1:02:52] spirits one time when I was was in
[1:02:55] school in the hostel I noticed that boys
[1:02:59] would get
[1:03:00] Vaseline and they would put it on their
[1:03:03] lips because it was
[1:03:05] dry and so I notic yeah even my mouth
[1:03:08] dries so
[1:03:10] much so I said I also begin putting so I
[1:03:14] took I took my jelly and I put on my
[1:03:17] lips I was like yeah now it is
[1:03:19] better I realized soon it dried
[1:03:23] up so I applied again I applied again
[1:03:27] and I was like after a few days what has
[1:03:30] come over
[1:03:31] me am I becoming a
[1:03:34] s and I'm telling you that these are
[1:03:40] spirits the devil will make you thirst
[1:03:42] after
[1:03:44] things that you are never supposed to
[1:03:46] thirst
[1:03:47] after to after worldly music to and
[1:03:52] these things you thir after you are
[1:03:53] actually worshiping them without

[1:04:19] games your hand is even even when you

[1:04:23] itching

[1:04:28] you where is the
[1:04:30] game sometimes even when you are in the
[1:04:33] church your hands begin itching you and
[1:04:37] then you take your phone until the
[1:04:39] pastor says listen to
[1:04:41] me like he what was happening to me

[1:05:02] them but you don't even know that you
[1:05:05] are actually worshiping those
[1:05:08] things but what does God
[1:05:10] desire God is looking for true
[1:05:14] worshipers worshippers that will not
[1:05:16] worship
[1:05:18] religion you know many we have many
[1:05:20] believers who are not actually
[1:05:23] believers we have many believers who are
[1:05:25] formal

[1:05:31] religiously not not Believers
[1:05:36] indeed they they keep this
[1:05:40] thir you thirst after

[1:05:54] come to that
[1:05:55] hour youve not come to that
[1:05:58] place amen whereby you become a true
[1:06:03] worship the woman thought she was
[1:06:09] a you know the
[1:06:12] moment started speaking with
[1:06:16] Jesus I want you to see
[1:06:19] this
[1:06:20] Jesus began to tell her about her life
[1:06:25] said go call your
[1:06:27] husband she said I have no husband she
[1:06:30] said okay you've said well because you
[1:06:33] have five and the one you're living with
[1:06:36] now is also not your
[1:06:38] husband then the woman said sir I
[1:06:42] perceive you are a
[1:06:44] prophet and the moment you know because
[1:06:46] her life was
[1:06:49] designed Jesus is the word of God and
[1:06:53] when Jesus speak
[1:06:55] he designs your
[1:06:58] life do you realize that if a preacher
[1:07:01] stands before
[1:07:03] you and he preaches under
[1:07:06] inspiration he will actually amen open
[1:07:09] your life and put it
[1:07:12] there it is not him it is the word of
[1:07:16] God the Jesus because Jesus Christ is
[1:07:21] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:07:25] if Jesus was to be
[1:07:26] here you would do the same
[1:07:29] thing he only spoke a few
[1:07:32] words but the woman said he has said
[1:07:35] everything I have
[1:07:39] done because whatever Jesus said amen
[1:07:45] had exposed the
[1:07:48] woman the things she has she leave the
[1:07:52] things she has done she had done all her
[1:07:53] life
[1:07:55] the things she thought she was keeping
[1:07:57] as a
[1:07:59] secret let me tell you all of you here
[1:08:02] today whatever secrets you think you
[1:08:05] [Applause]
[1:08:06] have amen God it takes him a
[1:08:10] moment to expose all of
[1:08:13] them but because God is
[1:08:16] gracious he doesn't expose
[1:08:19] you but what does he do are you hearing
[1:08:22] me CH he brings a preacher to talk about
[1:08:26] the things you have been
[1:08:28] doing to talk about your secret
[1:08:31] life things that you
[1:08:33] know things you cannot
[1:08:36] deny and you know the preacher doesn't
[1:08:39] know and what is that speaking to you
[1:08:43] that is God that is the same Jesus the
[1:08:46] one that made the woman at the
[1:08:48] world is the same one here
[1:08:51] today that comes veing
[1:08:55] and then he exposes your
[1:08:57] life but why does he expose your
[1:09:00] life many people just get
[1:09:03] offended and they walk away they say
[1:09:06] maybe so and so spoke about maybe so and
[1:09:09] so told him and he came to preach
[1:09:12] against me but let me tell you no one
[1:09:16] amen will inspire a
[1:09:19] preacher but God Only God only inspires
[1:09:22] a PR to talk about your secret
[1:09:26] life and when you hear those things it
[1:09:29] is because
[1:09:31] God he wants you to be a true
[1:09:35] worshiper he's exposing you so that he
[1:09:39] can bring you to
[1:09:40] himself he's exposing you so you can
[1:09:44] repent so you can come to a place you
[1:09:48] realize I have been a wrong
[1:09:51] worshiper I thought I was a
[1:09:54] but I not a worshiper oh God make me a
[1:10:00] true no we are also
[1:10:03] Believers we worship on the other
[1:10:05] Mountain our fathers have beening
[1:10:08] on so you're talking about the things of
[1:10:12] God yeah yeah
[1:10:14] yeah maybe she might have thought that
[1:10:17] maybe someone told Jesus about her
[1:10:21] life and so she was not moved
[1:10:25] and so she started speaking those
[1:10:27] words and the woman said unto her
[1:10:30] perceive that thou a
[1:10:32] prophet I can see you a prophet because
[1:10:36] the things you're
[1:10:37] speaking no man
[1:10:39] knew therefore you were a
[1:10:42] prophet all
[1:10:44] right our fathers worshiped in this
[1:10:47] mountain and he said that in Jerusalem
[1:10:50] is the place where men ought to
[1:10:52] worship
[1:10:56] the woman had to receive
[1:10:58] revelation of who this Jesus
[1:11:03] was she was speaking on two
[1:11:07] places the mountain of the I forget its
[1:11:10] name but the mountain of the of the
[1:11:13] Samaritans and that mountain was near
[1:11:18] she and and and the
[1:11:21] Jerusalem and so the Samaritans were
[1:11:23] always worshiping at that
[1:11:26] mountain but the Jews were always
[1:11:28] worshiping in
[1:11:30] Jerusalem because that's where the
[1:11:32] Temple of Solomon
[1:11:34] was and so the woman looking at Jesus
[1:11:37] being a Jew she thought to
[1:11:40] herself you Jews you say that we should
[1:11:43] go to Jerusalem to
[1:11:46] worship but for us we have this mountain
[1:11:49] where we've been worshiping the whole
[1:11:52] time and and so she did not
[1:11:56] realize Jesus was not introducing to her
[1:11:59] any
[1:12:01] place are you hearing me Jesus was not
[1:12:04] introducing to her any
[1:12:07] religion Jesus was introducing to her
[1:12:11] [Music]
[1:12:12] himself but the woman was about to miss
[1:12:16] it because she's talking about a place
[1:12:19] this place that
[1:12:22] place praise the name of the
[1:12:24] Lord and and and and then she says well
[1:12:29] uh Jesus says well what you worship you
[1:12:31] do not
[1:12:34] know but for us
[1:12:36] Jews we know what we
[1:12:39] worship because of course the the
[1:12:41] promise
[1:12:43] was that the Messiah would come out of
[1:12:49] David and that's why he said that
[1:12:51] salvation is of the
[1:12:52] Jews
[1:12:55] but the hour
[1:12:56] cometh and now Jesus now goes beyond
[1:13:02] Judaism and he tells this woman the
[1:13:06] cometh the
[1:13:09] cometh tell someone the
[1:13:12] coming the
[1:13:14] com
[1:13:16] Hallelujah and now
[1:13:18] is when the two
[1:13:21] worshipers shall worship the
[1:13:24] father in spirit and in
[1:13:26] truth oh mighty father seeketh such to
[1:13:30] worship
[1:13:32] Him are you hearing me Church the woman
[1:13:35] had a lot of preconceived
[1:13:42] ideologies what worship
[1:13:46] is like many of us have our preconceived
[1:13:51] ideas as long as I go to
[1:13:54] church and they will sing and maybe sing
[1:13:57] another
[1:13:58] special and the P speak a few words and
[1:14:02] then he pray for a few people and then
[1:14:04] we go home that's your preconceived idea
[1:14:07] about
[1:14:09] worship as long as I am seated in church
[1:14:13] and I go home then I've worshiped God
[1:14:17] and as long as I sing I pray I do this
[1:14:20] worship and you know I will go and when
[1:14:23] I lift up my hands God the holy spirit
[1:14:25] will come on me and I will sing and I
[1:14:26] will
[1:14:28] dance now let me tell you through
[1:14:32] Worship in one sense it is
[1:14:37] spontaneous and you cannot arrange
[1:14:42] yourself that I will do this and that
[1:14:45] and there is some a requirement we'll
[1:14:48] get into
[1:14:49] that many times when people say well I'm
[1:14:51] going to go and do this
[1:14:53] and the ho spirit will come that's not
[1:14:56] how usually it
[1:14:58] happens you do not have to have your
[1:15:00] preconceived
[1:15:04] ideas she had to come to a
[1:15:07] place of
[1:15:09] Revelation a place of
[1:15:11] sacrifice to become a true
[1:15:15] worshiper she had you know to break
[1:15:18] through the barriers of the
[1:15:22] history the history of the
[1:15:25] Samaritans they and and the Jews and
[1:15:28] Jerusalem and the mountain and this
[1:15:30] place and that place she had to break
[1:15:33] through all those
[1:15:36] barriers in the same way we also have to
[1:15:38] break through the barriers of of
[1:15:41] [Music]
[1:15:44] History many times we let our past lay
[1:15:48] Siege on
[1:15:51] us and then the Holy Spirit is not able
[1:15:53] oh I I hope you can follow me now on the
[1:15:56] holy spirit is not able to take us
[1:15:58] through to a
[1:16:02] place because we are so glued on our
[1:16:06] path if you want to be a true
[1:16:10] worshiper you must let your P
[1:16:14] go you must come to a place where you
[1:16:16] believe in in in the Jesus of
[1:16:22] today had to be set
[1:16:25] free she had to be
[1:16:27] liberated from all tribal
[1:16:31] Prejudice she had to come to a place
[1:16:34] where she's
[1:16:36] free
[1:16:38] openminded to accept God to come
[1:16:42] down I see it even a lot of
[1:16:45] times even in our services
[1:16:47] some where maybe God will lead a
[1:16:50] minister to sing a few
[1:16:52] songs
[1:16:54] people don't seem to walk into the
[1:16:56] anointing and they worship and because
[1:16:59] they're used in their
[1:17:03] mind all right the pastor will sing one
[1:17:06] song and then we shall go to the
[1:17:10] word so now when it becomes
[1:17:13] two four many switch
[1:17:17] off instead of entering into
[1:17:22] the
[1:17:24] if he says let us repeat the chorus five
[1:17:27] times that is too
[1:17:30] much why don't we be
[1:17:33] openminded and allow the Holy Spirit to
[1:17:35] come and overtake
[1:17:37] us all the Holy Spirit to come and
[1:17:40] overshadow
[1:17:41] us to the place whereby we become a true
[1:17:52] worship even the
[1:17:54] musicians if you used to play in a
[1:17:58] way that's not the only
[1:18:01] way be
[1:18:05] openmed be
[1:18:08] openhearted be ready for
[1:18:11] anything be ready for any drastic move
[1:18:13] by the Holy
[1:18:16] Ghost are you hearing me can we say Amen
[1:18:19] to that when we come to
[1:18:21] worship we must be ready for anything
[1:18:27] unplanned we must be ready for anything
[1:18:30] we do not know may
[1:18:32] happen if you feel like shouting don't
[1:18:35] say I did not plan to
[1:18:37] shout why am I feeling like this let me
[1:18:40] even go
[1:18:41] outside I feel like speaking in
[1:18:44] Tong and I didn't plan
[1:18:46] it oh no no I
[1:18:49] cannot come on Worship You You Lose
[1:18:52] Yourself
[1:18:54] you lose
[1:18:55] yourself if you feel like
[1:18:57] shouting there is a day here I had to
[1:19:00] say because I did not plan
[1:19:03] it but when I found it I said I have to
[1:19:06] do
[1:19:07] it because I'm not doing for myself or
[1:19:10] for the people I'm doing it for
[1:19:14] Jesus we must come to a place of being
[1:19:19] liberated our preconceived ideas about
[1:19:22] worship
[1:19:25] God will only accept the true
[1:19:29] worshiper God will accept someone who is
[1:19:31] ready to move when the spirit
[1:19:35] moves are you following me Hallelujah
[1:19:39] God is ready to accept somebody who will
[1:19:43] move when the Holy Ghost
[1:19:46] moves somebody who will run when the
[1:19:49] Holy Ghost
[1:19:50] runs amen somebody who will stand when
[1:19:54] the ghost stands how do you know because
[1:19:58] you'll be
[1:20:00] overshadow by the power of the Holy
[1:20:02] Ghost and you can feel

[1:20:10] gave you feelings in your
[1:20:12] body if he gave you emotions in your

[1:20:20] things of the
[1:20:21] world you be afraid to use it with the
[1:20:24] things of
[1:20:26] God someone gives you 1
[1:20:29] million and you all over the
[1:20:33] place but when you come in church and

[1:20:55] we are Pentecostal
[1:20:57] people and we have to worship God even
[1:20:59] with our
[1:21:03] emotional the Holy Ghost is not
[1:21:06] emotional but the Holy Ghost is
[1:21:09] emotional Hallelujah whatever the Holy
[1:21:11] Ghost was whatever his anointing was
[1:21:15] people were
[1:21:17] emotional one time there was a man
[1:21:19] called David and David was anointed
[1:21:23] Amen to worship God Amen with a dance
[1:21:27] and when he began
[1:21:28] dancing when he began dancing the more
[1:21:31] he danced the more he felt like
[1:21:34] dancing the more he danced the more he
[1:21:37] danced lose himself that even his SCS
[1:21:43] fell what a
[1:21:46] king his clo is falling
[1:21:49] off while dancing for
[1:21:51] God and his wife looked at him and said
[1:21:55] look at this man how could heic himself
[1:21:59] like this before the
[1:22:02] people and God struck her
[1:22:06] bar don't ever laugh at a
[1:22:12] worshiper you may become bar in whatever
[1:22:14] you are
[1:22:16] doing don't ever despise a
[1:22:19] worshiper let me tell you chains break
[1:22:22] off
[1:22:22] [Music]
[1:22:25] worship worship is such a big
[1:22:28] subject but today maybe we'll begin a
[1:22:31] little bit and then we can see if we
[1:22:32] take it on we'll see how the Holy
[1:22:35] Ghost and so friends I want you to
[1:22:38] understand that never despise a
[1:22:41] worshiper it is in worship that the
[1:22:43] power of God
[1:22:46] moves and this woman she had
[1:22:49] preconceived
[1:22:51] ideas on what worship
[1:22:55] was come on say Amen somebody she
[1:22:59] thought that when when
[1:23:02] she when she goes on the mountain she's
[1:23:06] worshiping she thought she's a
[1:23:09] Samaritan she thought she listen to me
[1:23:12] when Jesus came to her he told her
[1:23:15] forget about
[1:23:17] jism forget about
[1:23:19] samaritanism forget about me and you
[1:23:23] I have something to tell you here I have
[1:23:26] something to tell you here you don't
[1:23:28] know what you are are worshiping you
[1:23:31] don't know what you're worshiping but
[1:23:33] I'm coming to tell you I know and we
[1:23:36] Jews we know what we
[1:23:38] worship but then he he went ahead and he
[1:23:41] went beyond Judaism and he said the
[1:23:46] cometh oh God send that now the coming
[1:23:51] and now
[1:23:53] is Jesus is always the Jesus of the
[1:23:57] now God is always the god of the
[1:24:01] now don't say I felt like
[1:24:03] worshiping I felt like jumping I felt
[1:24:07] like cing you f like it then you do it
[1:24:09] then
[1:24:11] there the hour cometh and now is when
[1:24:16] the two
[1:24:18] worshippers do I have some two
[1:24:19] worshippers here today when worshipers
[1:24:23] shall worship the
[1:24:25] father in spirit and in truth for the
[1:24:30] father
[1:24:33] SEC now
[1:24:35] worship you cannot
[1:24:39] worship without
[1:24:41] Revelation and you cannot
[1:24:44] worship without
[1:24:46] sacrifice those two things if they lack
[1:24:49] in your
[1:24:51] worship is not a true
[1:24:55] worship let us examine this woman a
[1:24:58] little bit
[1:25:00] more verse
[1:25:02] 24 God is a spirit and they that worship
[1:25:06] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[1:25:09] truth the woman said unto him I know
[1:25:13] that the mesiah
[1:25:15] cometh which is called
[1:25:17] Christ oh you didn't say Amen because
[1:25:20] you didn't get it
[1:25:23] Jesus just told the
[1:25:24] woman the things about her and she said
[1:25:28] I perceive you a
[1:25:29] prophet and then after that Jesus knew
[1:25:33] she had not realized who he
[1:25:35] was they were talking about Judaism and
[1:25:38] worship of the Jews and things and the
[1:25:39] mountain and
[1:25:41] Jerusalem and then later on follow
[1:25:44] closely here later on oh my God may you
[1:25:48] may God reveal this to you now it is
[1:25:51] becoming sweeter and S
[1:25:53] and then later on he says you don't know
[1:25:56] what you worshiping but the cometh the
[1:26:00] cometh and now is that was the
[1:26:04] mystery which had just been
[1:26:07] revealed but our eyes were still
[1:26:10] closed the come now
[1:26:14] is when the true
[1:26:16] worshipers shall worship
[1:26:20] God trth the father seeks such to
[1:26:24] worship and and God continued God is a
[1:26:27] spirit and they that worship Him must
[1:26:30] worship Him in spirit and in
[1:26:32] truth and then then the woman now
[1:26:34] started coming closer
[1:26:36] now she said I
[1:26:39] know that the Messiah
[1:26:42] cometh which is called
[1:26:46] Christ when he is
[1:26:49] come he will tell us also
[1:26:54] so she knew that but she had no
[1:26:57] experience about
[1:26:59] it so you may know something but having
[1:27:02] an experience about what you know is
[1:27:04] something
[1:27:05] [Applause]
[1:27:08] else many people are Christians and they
[1:27:10] read the Bible but they don't have the
[1:27:12] experience of what is written in the
[1:27:18] Bible but the hour cometh and now is
[1:27:22] when people will realize that the god of
[1:27:25] the Bible is a living
[1:27:28] God by the time when you come to
[1:27:31] church and you have a problem and you
[1:27:34] are you are coming expecting a
[1:27:38] solution then you know God
[1:27:40] is the Bible says they that come to
[1:27:44] God must realize that he is and is a
[1:27:48] rewarder of all dently seek him you must
[1:27:53] realize that God is present you must
[1:27:56] realize that God is not a
[1:27:59] secret Amen to a Believer it is not
[1:28:03] secret what God can do what he has done
[1:28:06] for others he can do for you With Arms
[1:28:10] Wide
[1:28:11] Open God is a miracle working God what
[1:28:15] he has done in the past he can do today
[1:28:18] I'm telling you we must realize that God
[1:28:21] is
[1:28:22] we must believe in the Supernatural
[1:28:26] God we must believe in
[1:28:28] things we have not seen you call me a
[1:28:32] fool to do
[1:28:34] that well then you a fool not to do
[1:28:38] it because it is only a fool who does
[1:28:43] not believe in the existence of
[1:28:46] God but those who are
[1:28:49] believers they are wise they wise tell
[1:28:53] your neighbor you are
[1:28:55] wise you are wise because you believe
[1:28:59] that God
[1:29:00] is that God is come on say with me God
[1:29:04] is God
[1:29:06] is where I'm waiting for 10% of you to
[1:29:09] say God
[1:29:10] is
[1:29:12] is we are not called
[1:29:15] worshippers we are worship because we
[1:29:18] believe in the existence of
[1:29:20] God someone shout and Clap Your Hands
[1:29:23] for
[1:29:25] Jesus
[1:29:27] amen and we find
[1:29:31] here well I don't have to apologize for
[1:29:34] my
[1:29:36] excitement because the word of
[1:29:39] God is supposed to make me
[1:29:41] excited you will see what will happen to
[1:29:44] this woman
[1:29:45] shortly the woman she now said something
[1:29:50] and J was saying you are coming closer
[1:29:52] you coming
[1:29:53] closer I know that the Messiah cometh
[1:29:56] which is called
[1:29:58] [Music]
[1:30:20] Christ
[1:30:25] there is something I want you to see
[1:30:29] here the woman
[1:30:32] knew that the Messiah is
[1:30:35] coming it was head
[1:30:38] knowledge intellectual
[1:30:42] faith when he is come he will tell us
[1:30:45] all things it was intellectual
[1:30:48] Faith Jesus said unto her when Jesus
[1:30:53] comes the temp's power is
[1:30:56] brok when Jesus comes everything becomes
[1:31:00] clear let me tell it to
[1:31:03] you when Jesus once comes in your life
[1:31:07] you will realize it is him that matters
[1:31:09] and him
[1:31:12] alone not him and your
[1:31:15] effort not him and your situation not
[1:31:19] him and your mother not him and your
[1:31:21] friend not him and your father but him
[1:31:25] alone he alone
[1:31:28] matters my
[1:31:31] God praise
[1:31:33] God Jesus said unto
[1:31:35] her I that speak
[1:31:39] unto I'm
[1:31:43] he I'm he I want you to
[1:31:47] imagine what must have happened to that
[1:31:49] woman at that moment
[1:31:55] Hallelujah and the moment Jesus said
[1:31:57] those
[1:31:59] words as the woman was
[1:32:03] reacting as the woman was reacting to
[1:32:05] those
[1:32:07] words then the disciples
[1:32:10] came and
[1:32:11] mared that he was talking to the woman
[1:32:15] and yet no man said what what do you
[1:32:16] what are you looking
[1:32:18] for and what are you talking with her
[1:32:21] the woman then then that
[1:32:24] moment the woman left her
[1:32:28] water and went her way into the City and
[1:32:32] said unto the man come and see a man
[1:32:37] which told me all things that I have
[1:32:39] ever
[1:32:40] did is not this the
[1:32:42] Christ then they went out to the
[1:32:45] city and came unto him I wanted you to
[1:32:49] see how Revelation comes
[1:32:52] Jesus did not straight away say I am
[1:32:58] he he first spoke to her for a
[1:33:04] while he first designed her
[1:33:08] life now when if God wants to deal
[1:33:11] listen to me if God wants to deal with
[1:33:15] you if God has anything to do with any
[1:33:18] of
[1:33:20] you is going to do for
[1:33:23] you he will bring you he will drag you
[1:33:26] if he has
[1:33:28] to and se you set you down under the
[1:33:31] preaching of his
[1:33:36] word because that's the only way he has
[1:33:39] ordained for
[1:33:42] mankind to be
[1:33:44] restored
[1:33:48] red so he came to this woman
[1:33:52] why because the word of
[1:33:54] God the Bible says the word of God is a
[1:33:59] designer of the thoughts and intents of
[1:34:03] the of the
[1:34:04] earth it can even
[1:34:07] divide it is sharper than
[1:34:11] any can divide Soul and
[1:34:14] Spirit the word of God is
[1:34:17] powerful and let me tell you as always
[1:34:20] believe and I've believed
[1:34:23] give me any
[1:34:25] man give me any
[1:34:27] woman who has a
[1:34:31] soul who has a seed J of God
[1:34:35] in bring I don't care what he's
[1:34:38] doing he may be a drunken he may be a
[1:34:42] prostitute he may be so opposite and G
[1:34:48] Wayward bring him in the church
[1:34:52] sit him down under the preaching of this
[1:34:56] message if that man or woman is a seed
[1:34:59] of
[1:35:00] God he will sit under that
[1:35:03] word and that word will Design his
[1:35:07] life little by little little by little
[1:35:12] and one of these days that man that
[1:35:15] woman will be totally
[1:35:19] changed the only thing that can
[1:35:23] do to a seed of God is to remove them
[1:35:27] from hearing the
[1:35:29] word but brother don't worry about what
[1:35:32] you're going through in your
[1:35:34] life just make sure you do not leave the
[1:35:37] presence of the
[1:35:40] word hallelujah come under the word
[1:35:45] listen to the word every day listen to
[1:35:47] the word every evening when you at home
[1:35:50] listen to the word
[1:35:52] no matter what your life how it
[1:35:56] is and what will happen you will tell me
[1:36:00] you will be totally changed and even now
[1:36:03] as I'm speaking there are many who have
[1:36:06] changed already how many can
[1:36:09] Testify the word is
[1:36:12] powerful tell your neighbor the word is
[1:36:17] powerful the woman became
[1:36:20] naked
[1:36:21] before the
[1:36:23] word the word will make you
[1:36:26] naked your life will be before
[1:36:33] you how do you receive
[1:36:36] Revelation Revelation comes that
[1:36:39] way you sit under the
[1:36:42] word hear the
[1:36:44] word says faith is a
[1:36:47] revelation something that is revealed to
[1:36:50] you
[1:36:52] that is not
[1:36:53] yet but you believe it will
[1:36:58] be faith is a revelation of the will of
[1:37:03] God so by
[1:37:06] Revelation Romans
[1:37:09] 10:17 excuse me the Amplified
[1:37:12] version so faith comes by
[1:37:16] hearing what is
[1:37:19] told and what is
[1:37:22] heard comes by the preaching of the
[1:37:25] message that came from the
[1:37:29] lips of Christ the Messiah
[1:37:33] himself if I speak to you my
[1:37:36] words you can't receive
[1:37:39] Faith but if I speak to you the word of
[1:37:42] God you will receive
[1:37:44] Faith because the word of God is
[1:37:47] powerful no matter how hard your heart
[1:37:50] is the word of God will break
[1:37:54] you the word of God will break
[1:37:57] you the word of God is
[1:37:59] powerful but the devil is
[1:38:02] s that little
[1:38:04] guy he will try to take you out of the
[1:38:07] Pres of
[1:38:08] the so you don't get to hear so you
[1:38:11] don't get to change but as long as you
[1:38:14] stay under the
[1:38:15] word you will receive faith and if you
[1:38:18] do not have faith you do not have a Bas
[1:38:21] for true
[1:38:23] worship because faith is revelation and
[1:38:25] Revelation is
[1:38:28] Faith and you cannot worship without
[1:38:32] faith without true
[1:38:36] Revelation the woman
[1:38:38] said you know she waited under the
[1:38:40] preaching of the
[1:38:42] word and the mesiah SP of of faith
[1:38:48] in by the word which is spoken
[1:38:52] and then she
[1:38:53] ran and she said come see a man which
[1:38:57] told me all the things I've ever
[1:38:59] did is not this the
[1:39:03] Christ and the prophet says the great
[1:39:06] Shepherd is
[1:39:08] calling he's calling his seed his Sheep
[1:39:11] by
[1:39:12] name the creative voice of God is
[1:39:15] calling them from the
[1:39:20] Dust or changing their atoms even though
[1:39:23] they had not fallen
[1:39:29] asleep even even if they have not fallen
[1:39:32] asleep you know he those who have not
[1:39:35] died he will change their
[1:39:39] atoms those who have who have died and
[1:39:42] burried they will they will
[1:39:45] resurrect it is the rapture it is the
[1:39:48] great marriage supp of the lamb and his
[1:39:50] bride
[1:39:53] but the Rapture is not only uh uh the
[1:39:56] roll
[1:39:59] call no but the Rapture is not the only
[1:40:02] Ro
[1:40:04] call there at the second there at the
[1:40:08] second Resurrection at the white Throne
[1:40:10] judgment also will names be confessed
[1:40:13] before the father and his
[1:40:19] angels show you a roll
[1:40:23] call the first roll call is when we are
[1:40:26] alive here on
[1:40:28] Earth when we when we the word is
[1:40:32] preached to you you hear it you believe
[1:40:36] it you say Amen you accept it you've
[1:40:40] heard your name being
[1:40:41] called now it doesn't matter you may die
[1:40:44] but you will hear another Ro
[1:40:47] call and you will answer
[1:40:49] again even if you are you are
[1:40:53] dead and your bones have become
[1:40:58] soil you will not die
[1:41:03] forever I can become radical with
[1:41:07] this because it is worth
[1:41:09] it people become radical with all sorts
[1:41:12] of
[1:41:14] things only for this
[1:41:16] Earth but this is beyond the
[1:41:19] earth I believe in there
[1:41:22] Resurrection no matter what you call me
[1:41:26] I believe it will happen my name shall
[1:41:28] be called and again my name shall be
[1:41:31] called he says on the white Throne
[1:41:33] another names other name shall be
[1:41:37] called but I tell you friends I want my
[1:41:40] name to be called in the first
[1:41:42] resurrection because then I will know
[1:41:44] I'm
[1:41:47] safe and this woman as Jesus was
[1:41:50] speaking speaking to
[1:41:52] her she had a name and she ran to the
[1:41:56] city she said come see a man who has
[1:42:00] told me everything I have
[1:42:01] done isn't this the very
[1:42:04] Messiah and I believe he's here once
[1:42:07] again calling all our
[1:42:10] names and we are
[1:42:13] responding because we have believe this
[1:42:15] message and we have not believed this
[1:42:17] message to remain the way we are we have
[1:42:20] believed this message for us to be
[1:42:23] changed for us to be
[1:42:27] reborn we cannot claim to be Believers
[1:42:30] of this
[1:42:31] m and we still live like
[1:42:34] [Music]
[1:42:37] Sinners if we are inde
[1:42:40] believers this life has to be
[1:42:43] changed your desires have to be
[1:42:46] Chang hallelujah
[1:42:49] amen you you got to to receive another
[1:42:51] kind of
[1:42:55] life and my time is up but in a few
[1:42:59] moments I'll just summarize a little bit
[1:43:00] about
[1:43:03] Abel Abel and
[1:43:06] Cain they had to
[1:43:09] sacrifice now that that's where you see
[1:43:12] sacrifice without
[1:43:15] Revelation that's where you see
[1:43:16] sacrifice with Revelation and sacrifice
[1:43:18] without
[1:43:19] revelation
[1:43:24] in the message the invisible un brother
[1:43:26] says
[1:43:28] re and Revelation is only is the only
[1:43:32] thing the revelation of the
[1:43:36] word the revelation of the
[1:43:39] word Jesus
[1:43:41] said Upon This
[1:43:44] Rock I will build my
[1:43:46] church and the Gate of Hell shall not
[1:43:48] Prevail
[1:43:49] against faith is a
[1:43:52] revelation because faith has been
[1:43:53] revealed to
[1:43:55] you Abel by faith offered by
[1:44:02] Revelation meaning by
[1:44:04] faith to God a more excellent
[1:44:09] sacrifice than that
[1:44:12] of now sacrifice means giving to the
[1:44:15] Lord whatever he requires of our
[1:44:19] time
[1:44:21] our Earthly
[1:44:23] positions you can say money Goods lands
[1:44:26] whatever it is and our
[1:44:28] energies to further his
[1:44:30] work so when I talk about
[1:44:33] sacrifice that's what I'm talking about
[1:44:36] you canot truly worship
[1:44:39] god without
[1:44:42] sacrificing but you can your
[1:44:44] sacrifice without
[1:44:48] Revelation cannot please God
[1:44:51] so two worshippers are those that are
[1:44:53] going to
[1:44:56] sacrifice but also with
[1:45:00] Revelation in in Matthew 6:33 says
[1:45:04] but seek first the kingdom of
[1:45:07] God and his righteousness and all these
[1:45:11] things shall be added unto
[1:45:13] you so to seek the kingdom you need to
[1:45:16] sacrifice other things
[1:45:19] first willingness to sacrifice shows our
[1:45:22] devotion to
[1:45:27] God the woman had to sacrifice her water
[1:45:32] pot you know you cannot claim that you
[1:45:34] are serving God when you're not ready to
[1:45:36] sacrifice that thing which you call so
[1:45:42] precious forget about it you might as
[1:45:45] well forget about serving
[1:45:47] God if you are not ready to sacrifice
[1:45:52] your Isaac you might as well forget
[1:45:54] about serving
[1:45:56] God if you are not
[1:45:58] willing to sacrifice the people and the
[1:46:01] land where you came
[1:46:03] from you might as well forget following
[1:46:07] God he was told God Abraham was told for
[1:46:10] leave your people leave your land and go
[1:46:12] to a land I'll show
[1:46:16] you so you ask me a question can I serve
[1:46:19] God
[1:46:21] can I truly worship
[1:46:23] God and still keep my
[1:46:26] things and still keep the desires of the
[1:46:30] world can I truly worship God and still
[1:46:34] go to a
[1:46:37] nightclub can I still serve God and I
[1:46:41] still do some little
[1:46:43] witchcraft can I serve God and I keep
[1:46:47] friendship with the
[1:46:49] world is impossible it is like east east
[1:46:53] from the
[1:46:54] West you simply have to choose you have
[1:46:58] to choose to
[1:46:59] lose in order to gain the woman had to
[1:47:04] choose the moment Revelation
[1:47:07] struck and that's why I said you may
[1:47:09] choose to live and forsake
[1:47:12] things but if you choose to do it
[1:47:15] mechanically without
[1:47:17] Revelation it will fail and we have seen
[1:47:21] so many people who have been soall
[1:47:25] Believers for many years even and after
[1:47:29] some years they
[1:47:31] say why I left the
[1:47:34] message why I'm no longer a Believer
[1:47:36] they were not a Believer to begin
[1:47:38] with what they had was intellectual
[1:47:43] Faith intellectual Faith
[1:47:47] fails but you have to have the faith
[1:47:49] like that of this Samaritan
[1:47:53] woman when when Revelation When Faith
[1:47:56] struck
[1:47:58] her she had come to FH water and she had
[1:48:02] this picture in her
[1:48:04] hand she forgot about it she said I will
[1:48:08] no longer care about
[1:48:10] it the Bible says she left it
[1:48:13] aside she let it break and she fall and
[1:48:18] rain with another pap
[1:48:21] let us have a new
[1:48:23] purpose let us be
[1:48:26] inspired by a new
[1:48:28] purpose listen Church it is an
[1:48:37] overhaul
[1:48:40] trajectory totally from the inside
[1:48:44] out that is what it means to have true
[1:48:49] worship
[1:48:51] and sacrifice has two things in
[1:48:53] it what you
[1:48:56] forego and what you give amen she left
[1:49:00] her
[1:49:01] picture Hallelujah and then she gave her
[1:49:05] time to hear the word and then she gave
[1:49:09] her time to testify and her strength and
[1:49:13] her heart to tell others about what God
[1:49:17] has done for you cannot sacrifice
[1:49:22] with that
[1:49:23] Revelation and you please
[1:49:26] God you must have
[1:49:28] faith in order to please God if you do
[1:49:32] not have faith you cannot please God and
[1:49:36] my time is up but I wanted to go to
[1:49:39] Abel that's what happened with Abel
[1:49:42] and both of them
[1:49:44] sacrificed but God rejected one and he
[1:49:48] accepted another because one
[1:49:50] sacrifice had
[1:49:55] Revelation it's not because you've given
[1:49:57] a
[1:49:58] million and has given
[1:50:01] 5,000 it is how much Revelation do you
[1:50:05] have what you're doing is is it by
[1:50:08] Revelation when you hear the word and
[1:50:11] God
[1:50:12] inspires do this for my
[1:50:15] kingdom and you don't do it whatever you
[1:50:18] bringing for the offering is nothing
[1:50:22] because you failed to obey and submit
[1:50:28] Revelation
[1:50:30] submit to the
[1:50:33] Revelation that you
[1:50:35] receive after hearing the
[1:50:37] word we'll talk more about it later God
