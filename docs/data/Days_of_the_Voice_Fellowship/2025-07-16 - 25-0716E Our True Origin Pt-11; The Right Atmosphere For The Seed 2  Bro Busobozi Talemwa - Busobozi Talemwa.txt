And by the end of this service, Lord, may we all say our hearts burn within us as he minister to us. Minister to each of our hearts, Lord. And may may we may our hunger be quiet. May our thirst be satisfied. Lord, we commit this service into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Well, God bless you saints. Good evening. Are you please turn to your neighbor ask them good evening. See you in the house of the Lord today. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to request the those of you this side to please come this side. Um, I just want to before we go to the preaching of the word today, &gt;&gt; I just wanted to give you a little bit of an update, especially those who missed who didn't give a get a chance to go with us. Brother Marvin, do we have the photos ready? Brother Isaac, if you can also show those who Uh you can see that we had maybe we had a good representation from the church. I think about 40 or 50 we were able to make it and as you can see we had we we stormed the whole place and I'm sure that the neighbors did not expect after people coming out you know uh and and we just seized the whole place and we went there and had some good time of prayer. You have more pictures, brother. You only had one picture. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Just give us as many as you have. Come on. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, that's brother Dan there. And you can see everybody smiling. You know, footstep is possession. We stepped in that place and we claimed it. We believe it is ours. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. Come on. Give me more pictures. Ah. Oh, you're done. All right. I don't know how many brother Isaac had and how many I did not prepare them earlier, but I told them on the last minute that they should make some some photos ready to show us. So um those of you who went to that place, I know you already happy and um we had already done some initial due diligence. I don't know how you would want to say that in Uganda due diligence is what you do to ensure that what you are buying is legitimate. I'm glad that uh we we have brother Neville here, a lawyer. I'm sorry, brother Neville. I never meant to give you away today. You know, he went an extra mile of doing um searches. We we did searches in the land in the lands and also um you know whatever is required to ensure that we are the land we are we are embarking on buying is legitimate and I'm glad to inform you that we found that the land is legitimate. Amen. and u you know whoever reaches there is just excited. So um as as as I informed you on Sunday, it still stands. Um only that the the good news that I have after the announcement on on of Sunday, we had two among us. [Music] One one brother said, "Well, before the end of the week, he's going to get two million views." and uh and uh one sister she spoke when everybody was there listening but because we are streaming I don't know whether she wants me to mention her name she said she she's going to you know what do you call the old people's savings take 500,000 shillings out of it [Music] give it towards the land fund I think uh those uh those are real sacrifices and God is pleased with sacrifices like that and so that reduces the the the because we needed about 6 how much data 6 something that we are remaining with to be able to hit 100 million And uh that's what we need to give as a down payment. I know there are many questions how we going to do that how you know we are doing things by faith not by sight. What I know that we ought to do, if we are moving by faith, just keep moving. Don't stay in one place. &gt;&gt; And the way you do that is by giving what you have. The Lord will multiply. Every one of you has something. And even those of you following us online, this ministry is a blessing to you. Don't just take the spiritual benefits. You also tap in the physical benefits by giving you receive. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I know that we have groups and maybe brother Isaac can also put up those groups the contact for the if you want to join a group. Please join and let's do this together. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are going to the book of Luke today and we are reading out of Luke chapter 8 is what we read on Sunday. So this is a continuation the right atmosphere part two [Music] still dealing with the our true origin. How many are being blessed on this series? Amen. We are reading out of Luke chapter 8. I'm going to read from verses 4 to to 8 and then we'll be seated. We can read the rest afterwards. And when much people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable. A saw went out to sow his seed, and he as he sowed, some fell by the wayside, and it was trotten down, and the fowls of the air devoured, and some fell upon a rock, and as And as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away because it lacked moisture. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprung up with it, and choked it. And others fell on good ground, and sprung up, and bear fruit and hundfold. And when he had said these things, he cried. He And he that has ears, uh, excuse me. And when he had said these things, he cried. He that has ears to hear, let him hear. Foreign [Music] [Music] speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. [Music] Amen. You may be seated, please. Amen. Happy to see uh Mrs. Allan here today. God bless you. Alan to see you brother Peter. Some of these faces are very rare in church on such a day. So when I see you here God bless you all. Amen. Amen. Uh how many have come tired? How many have come hungry? How many are ready to feast on the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Amram, I'm happy to see you. I thought you wouldn't make it tonight. Wonderful. Amen. Now, um I'm I'm we're dealing with part two on this on this sub subtopic, the right atmosphere. Friends, we are dealing with a very important subject and uh it has personally blessed my heart really really so much and as you know you get deeper in you know studying the message you realize indeed it is honey in the rock. It is honey in the rock. Um but sadly very few so-called Bible believers read the Bible. Very few. Very few message believers read the message. And that is the problem. That is the problem. But if we were able to read the Bible like feast on it, study it and put it on our daily um you know menu able to study the message. I can assure you we would be different quality of believers. Many of the things that we are struggling with in our in this life, we would overcome them without even praying. And that is the truth. That's the truth. Because you see, a child being a child can only survive by begging his father and mother. That is how a child can survive. Because he's a child, he knows no better. He doesn't have a backbone to live on by himself. He can only depend on the good graces of the mother or the father because he's a child. That's all he knows how to do is to ask. Okay. And many and depending on their age, sometimes if they're younger, they don't even know how to talk, so they just cry. Brother Bham says the only way a child can know can demand for what she or they want is to cry for it. You see, because he's a child. But as this child grows, there are different seasons and stages of growth, maturity, The child one time will learn to know that not everything that they want they will get from the father. At a certain age, this child will understand. There are certain things I have to ask my father and there are certain things I have to you know find means to acquire. Then you know as this child grows this child becomes an adult. That's what you now call reaching maturity. And now when a child has reached maturity, he's no longer going to be asking anything from the father because it's no longer now about the father. It's about him. Because whatever the father is, when this child has reached maturity, they have gained, they have learned how to acquire things the way the father acquires things. And so then they will acquire those things. They will know how does the father acquire it. Then they have read the land because they have come to maturity. And you see that's why you know adoption is being blessed as a son not a young son or child son daughter of God. So it's no longer here ye God. Now hear ye him the son. You remember that voice which was which happened when Jesus was being baptized. This is my beloved son in in whom I am pleased. So now where was the father? The father was now embodied in the son. The authority of the father was now in the son. The ability of the father was now in the son. So now the voice did not say here ye me but he said hear ye because he now was speaking on behalf of the father. And that's why he he looked at the Pharisees and he told them that the father is in me and I am in him. And he said, I do only the will of my father. What I have learned of him, you know, what I I see of him. So because he has come into that place [Music] as a as a as an adopted son. And we as believers, we many times we we live like babies, we live like children and many times we are overcome by certain things in our Christian walk because we are still babies. We are still children. We are still young and everything everything we have to run to the father. We cry like babies. But you see we we don't grow. Why we don't grow? You find that there something same same thing you were praying about 5 years ago. You are praying about it 5 years later. Same thing. The same demons which were defeating you 5 years ago are the same even now. It means there is a problem somewhere. There is a problem somewhere and I can tell you that problem is not God because everything that God had to do for us he has already done. Hallelujah. There is no more coming for you. He has done it all. And he said it is finished. So now what is remaining is for you, for me to grow to such a stature of a man that is perfect, thoroughly furnished, wanting nothing. You cannot grow into that place of position without attaining uh what God has intentionally intended for you to attain and that is it comes by none other thing but by the word. It comes only by the word. So I want to challenge you. I want to challenge us and I'll keep challenging you brethren. Let us learn to feed on the word as individuals, not as a church. This this is something that you have to do as an individual if you believe your rapture material. That is why the rapture of the Gentiles is not going to be a group thing. Maybe this may disappoint some of you but we are not going to be raptured as a church that now DVF is your church. No, the Bible says two will be in bed, one shall be taken, one will remain. Two will be in the field, one shall be taken, one will remain. Two shall be, you know, different times. In Australia, it's a different time. Australia, in America, it's a different time. You know, in Canada, different Africa different, Europe different. He's showing you that this is going to be something that will happen all over the world. The translation of the saints, it will happen at the same time. in different time zones and it will not be a group taken at a go. It will be an individual experience. So we are going to you are going to be translated as an individual. If if you you you came to that to maturity, you cannot harvest a seed which is still eh green. young. &gt;&gt; You can only harvest a a riapen seed of fruit. It has to ripen first and then you harvest it and you take it into the the bank. So he is coming back for a church that has ripened, not a younger church, a church which is young and still feeding on me. is coming for a a a grown church. Let me put it this way. An adult church, a church that is no longer feeding on the miracle of the world, but a church that is feeding on the meat of the world. Praise the name of the Lord. There are many things that I would want to say, but because we have limited time, allow me to stick with my notes today. And so, we've been talking about the seed. And how you are the seed, you are the seed of God. Of course, you remember we started with with speaking of those that he forneew. He also predestinated. But you see, when did he know them? They were in his mind before the foundation of the world. And you see, those are the what we call the seed of God. The ones that were in him. They were always a part of God. But you see, they bypassed their theophony. They came into this body of sin and they've been groaning like all nature is groaning waiting for them to be redeemed. And we talked about the book in the book of Revelation chapter 5, how there was no one worthy to take in heaven and on earth. No man was worthy. And then as John was still weeping, the voice told him, "Weep not John for the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David has prevailed to take the book and to lose the seals thereby." And then we talked about the book and we found out that this book is the book of redemption. We found out it is the abstract title deed of everything that Adam had in the beginning. Everything he lost, everything he was, his true identity, his true title did to everything that is on earth was in that book. Here was the title deed and he lost it. But we saw that it could not go back to it could not go to the hands of Satan because his hands were filthy. Amen. Amen. And are you not so glad that your identity even when you were lost even when you were in sin? It cannot go to Satan. Amen. So it had to go back to the original owner God. Amen. And he had it in his right hand. And then who said, "Who is worthy to take the book and lose the seal?" No one was worthy. No man is worthy. And we found out that no none of us is worthy to do the work of redemption. And then we found out redeem is not to forgive. To redeem is to bring back what was lost. back to its original nature and state. To forgive is to see some some sinful thing or or person and removing sin from them. But so it's different. We were not sinners made children of God. We were sons of God. Listen, perfect, sinless in the image of God. But we came, we bypassed our theony coming into this world. And we came through sin. The Bible says in sin did my mother conceive me. But then we found that is not our true identity. This is not our true origin. This earth is not our true origin. We came from God. We go back to God. And when we say we came from God, it means we came from perfection. We go back to perfection. We came from that sinless image of God. And that's what we are going back to. So redemption bypasses Adam. It bypasses even Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Are you following me now? Because Pentecost is the baptism of the Holy Spirit. And we found I there are some comments I wanted to make but let me pause them for now. But you see when we talk about redemption, it passes Pentecost. trustes Adam and goes way back into the mind of God. So now when you say I am redeemed, you are not just made a Pentecostal. More than that, you've not just been taken back to Genesis after the fall. More than that, you are taken way back in the mind of God. where your true origin is. So because you are seed and a seed of God cannot be lost. Praise the name of the Lord. So now we've been talking about many things, many, many things. And I trust that you've been, you know, going over them and, you know, reading the message and getting deeper. We also see tonight speaking of the right atmosphere of birthing the seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, you are sick. Yes, you can be lost. But there is a problem. Even if you are a sin, if you are in a wrong atmosphere, nothing will happen. &gt;&gt; So you remain the way you are. you won't be changed. Praise the name of the Lord. But now here in in vers 11, he says, "Now the parable is this because you are speaking of the ser who went out to sew and how he swed seed in different types of places. He spoke about sewing seeds. uh some the first ones they fell by the west and he talked about the ones that fell upon a rock. He talked about the others that fell upon the throne and and and the others that fell on good ground. So now he gives the interpretation and says now the parable is this the seed is the word of God. Are you following me now? &gt;&gt; The seed is the word of God. So, and you know I talked about you being seed and on Sunday I tried to show you the connection between you and the word. Amen. Amen. The word of God is a seed. You are a seed. The son of God is a seed. What spoke you into existence? The word of God. Where were you before the the foundation of the world? You were in God. What does that make you? It makes you a part of God, a part of his nature. And that means there is a part of God in me that no matter what the devil does, that part of of God in me can never be destroyed. That part of God in me is a table. That part of God in me can be buried but never forever. No matter where you place it, cannot die because it is eternal. That's why Jesus said, "Ye are gods." And and he says that it doesn't appear now what we shall be. But when he appears, we shall be like him because we are born of his bones, flesh of his flesh. But now here he's speaking of the seed being the word of God. And he begins by talking about those that were on that were the seed which was thrown on the west side. The devil comes and he takes away the word out of those hearts unless they should believe and be saved. Now the only the elect will not be deceived. The shark or the tears cannot be here with a sea. overcoming power the of the seed. &gt;&gt; Follow me. Just just follow me closely. The power that overcomes the world. &gt;&gt; I told you and I said in you in the sea. Remember that eternal part which cannot be destroyed. That part, that part is what I call the seed. &gt;&gt; And the power to overcome the world is in that part of it. Hallelujah. Not only in the written word, not only in the spoken word. And I told you I used to think that as long as the spoken word is preached, as long as the written word is read, people will believe. And I used to say the word can change anything and everything. Whereas an evangelist, you can you can preach that, but it's not entirely true. Follow me closely. When I say it can change. Yes. Because the word matures. The word matures but matures what you are. Are you following? Whatever you are, the word does not change it, but the word matures. So the overcoming power is not in the word itself but is in the seed of God in you that is being quickened by that word. The word quickens the seed. Only the seed can be quickened. Only the seed can be quickened and dramatized and it will come to life. If you bury a stone and you bury a seedinger and you put them in the right atmosphere, no matter what you do, this stone will never go. It will never be quickened. But that seed will be quickened because that seed has life. I'm going to begin this today with a little story &gt;&gt; and I told um a little story that I told some brothers recently and um and you know I read it somewhere said that this boss was you know starting his company was um you know in in the evening years of his company of his life and he wanted to retire but he wanted to find a new CEO. He called he calls all the employees. He gives all of them seed and he told them this seed. I'm looking for a new CEO, but I'm going to give each of you one of these seed, the one that will take good care of the seed and ensure it grows and grows well be the one to replace it. So long story short, all of them took the seat and I think I don't know how many men there were, maybe seven of them or something like that, you know, all of them came back with beautiful uh uh plants, goodlooking plants in the pot and oh my, they were just so happy. Everybody was proud of their plant, how healthy it was looking. But then there came another one. who did not have anything. His port was empty. There was no plant but only a dead seed. So the the the CEO looked at all of them and told them congratulations and everybody was like and then he shook the hand of the one that did not have any plan. Congratulations you are the new CEO. &gt;&gt; Nobody could understand that. But only the CEO knows what he had done. He had boiled those seeds. They had no life in them. They took the seeds. You know they had tried their best. to water them and bring them in the sun and make the atmosphere try them and they did not succeed. So each of them because they were not honest. They were not sincere. They went and brought other seeds and they planted them in the but who was sincere He thought he had failed. And he said, "No, even if I failed, let me go and tell my boss, I tried my best. I did what I could." And you know, he did not know that his boss had played a trick on them. The problem was not the atmosphere. The problem was the type of scene. You can have a wonderful atmosphere, but you can never create seed in that atmosphere. That atmosphere will only bring forth the seed which already has life in it. Praise the name of the Lord. So the seed needs a certain atmosphere. for it to be quickened, for it to come to maturity. Remember, it has to be quickened grow and come to maturity. And a normal seed will need good ground. We'll need water. We'll need a sun. And these are the things we're talking about. Brother Bam says, you know, well, someone may say, well, we are having our youth for Christ. Our church is having a meeting. We want so many members. Nothing against that. That's all right. But that is only the atmosphere. That might be an old hen's feathers. But if you get in the right atmosphere there, it will hatch eagle. If you are an eagle egg and if you were for ordained of God to see, you can't help from seeing it. You are coming forth in a resurrection. Amen. What does an atmosphere do? An atmosphere cannot bring forth a seed that was never meant to see it. [Music] A preacher may preach, a preacher may dance, a preacher may shout, the preacher may preach until you say, but it is not the preacher. It's the nature of seed in you. That is why friends we we are preachers should never try to convince people to change force people to change. May God help me so I can bring it to you today. If I put up a tough face and I force you sisters to dress cut and I force you brothers to cut your hair in a certain way. Are you understanding me? And I force you dress certain way. You will do it because you're fearing me. Every time you think about doing what you want, you will remember my tough face and you remember when I said you will go to hell. So you will say ah I don't want and then you you will do what I I want you to do. You get a point and that is the problem with legalistic sermons. You get a point. So people will not show who they are. You will have a full church full of hypocrites full of people who are what they are not. So what do we need to do? There is only one solution to create the right atmosphere for the right seed to be born. and the right atmosphere. We find out it is in three forms. The first form is a good ground. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. And then he talked about the nature of the ground and this is now you going to do it. How is your ground? How is your heart? How receptive are you whether you are seed of God or you are not. If you don't love the word if you don't open for the word. If you are not ready to be corrected. If you're not ready to learn. You can never change. And that's why the devil would try his best to make sure you don't come to church to make sure you don't get give time to God because you cannot know whether your heart is good or bad. You don't know whether your ground is good or bad. Praise the name of the Lord. So the reason why we have church services is to create the right atmosphere for that is why we organize youth council. That's why we we listen to the message and we pray. We sing, we do all these things. But all these things will not and cannot change the Nancy. It can only make them realize who they are. When you come to church, you only realize who you are. As you are hearing the word, it places you in your place. I I love the word of God. Amen. That's why we should always go to a Bible church. Bible church, nothing less, nothing more. Because then how can you know who you are even if you were good ground? If the seed being sown there is wrong, how can you know who what what kind of ground you are? We need a Bible church. Praise the name of the Lord. Now, but the Bam says something. You see no pumping up in broken systems. The sermon title is broken system. And so here it says, well, of course I'm beginning in the middle of the quote, but it says no pumping up. It's the power. The power is within itself. It needs no priming. It own life is in itself. The that's the way the seed of God is in a man's heart. The life of God is within the individual, not in the church. In you, it is in you. You are the one that has the jam of life in you. So I don't need to pump you up. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I don't need to do that. I don't need to do that. I only need to give you the word. I may give you the word slowly. I may give you the word fast. I I may give you the word shouting. I may give you the word, you know, with a little voice. Depends on how I am made. But the bride loves the word. You don't need to pump them up. &gt;&gt; The bride is not supposed to be pumped. Just give them the word. And the the seed there is a jam of life in you. Whenever you hear something that is like the word of life in you will be somehow quickened. Amen. In the message original is the original seed. How can you tell them? Give them the word. Test. How can you know it? Speak the word. See what they say about it. You cannot differentiate who is who. That's why in a church when people come to church, you cannot use your physical eyes to tell who is who. You know when when king when prophet Samuel went in the house of Jesse you know he saw this good young man and you can say hallelujah he is this one behold the anointed of the Lord said God said watch all right I will look at her this one has a beautiful tongue This is a prophet and he was wrong each time. The only way you can know who the Lord has chosen. The only way you can know who who is the seed is give them the word. See what they say about you. If they don't believe the word, they have no seed jam in each. Amen. You see why we should tell our friends about don't fear to tell anybody about this or they will refuse. If they refuse, no problem. They are not seed but seed will hear the word and their seed in them will be quickened. They are of the evil one and and deceive you. As the first bride was deceived and the second bride was deceived, they are deceivers of the third bride by hibering the word or trying to. God never placed signs ahead of his work. Amen. God never placed signs ahead of his word. The signs were added for proof of the word. But the word is fast. To prove it, Elijah say to the woman, "Bake me a cake first. Then watch the miracle happen. Come to the word first and then watch the miracle happen. The seed word itself is what the Holy Spirit energizes. Amen. Hallelujah. Brother, sister, feed the on the word. Receive the word fast and wash when the Holy Spirit come. He will energize. &gt;&gt; He will energize that seed word in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In a messenger trial. And the defense witness also wants to call your attention here. Amen. That the word of God is said by Jesus Christ to be a seed. And a seed can only grow when it falls into the fatile enough ground to quicken the seed. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. This message. You may say, I see it. I see it. Baptism in Jesus name is correct. Women are not supposed to wear trousers. Women are not supposed to be changed. Are you following me? Men are supposed to be men. Women are supposed to be men. And and and and you know, you begin to talk about all these mysteries of of the end time and the seventh seed and seven church ages and the seven seals and all these the operation of the gifts in the church and how the church must operate and tongues and interpretations and you know all these things you said. Someone if they are a seed, they are good ground. [Music] If they themselves are a seed of God, they are a good ground for the word of God to be quickened. And if this seed falls into that kind of ground, it is fatile with faith. it has got to be quickened. Amen. But if there is nothing in there, I can say you're just wasting your time. Do you have a friend that you have ever spent time preaching the message to for a long time and nothing happened and you felt you had done your best? It's not about your best. God himself came and preached to Cain. God himself. He preached an evangelistic sermon. And it was not even a sermon to cut cut him. It was not a sermon to cut him. It was a sermon. Hope. You get the point. If you do well, won't you be accepted? But what happened to K? He never did well. He never believed the word because there was no jam of life there to be dramatized. There is nothing in there. So brother, sister, you have to believe that there are people on this earth who have nothing in there to believe with. No matter what you do, no matter what you say, you can never move them to believe the word. But there also some people who no matter what you do to them, no matter how much sin you bring into their life, no matter how far away they fall from the world, you can never take them to hell. Now those are the seed of God. They can never be lost. Those are the ones that we saw in the in the bridge. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The bleach of the blood of Jes. They can never be lost. Jesus said, "All you have given me are mine and I will lose none of them. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I don't need to tell you what to do and what not to do. I need to keep preaching to you the word. I need to give you the word. If you have a seed of God in your soul, it doesn't matter what you are going through. Amen. That seed of God in your in your life, as long as it is receiving the word, it gets quickened. is getting it gets changed and you realize the things you were doing you no longer can do that. Why? Because you have been you have been made alive. Amen. If that same spirit amen that raised Christ from the dead in you, he shall do what we even body. That is the very last thing that is going to be quickened. But I can tell you friends right now our soul is quickened. Our spirit is quickened. We are waiting for our body. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; One of this morning our body is going to be quick. We shall be translated into another body. Amen. Mortality. mortality shall be swallowed up of life and we shall have another body. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Never more to perish. Never more to to feel things that are not right. Never be touched anymore by bad feelings. Why? Because you will be changed. Just like if you wanted a blood transfusion, you went to a turnip, like a tube in yourself and in a turn. How are you going to get any blood? There is no blood there. No more can the word of God ever be quickened in an unbeliever's heart. or a skeptic. It is got to fall into the genuine faith that believes the heavens and earth will pass away. But that word shall never fail. Like Abraham that called things which was not as though they were, he hoped against hope in God. Amen. Friends, it is by faith we are going to overcome the world. That faith is not coming. That faith is not in heaven. That faith is right in us. Now we find that this defense witness wants to call this to attention. that the word is a seed that a s. It is written in the scripture that the word is a seed and a seed must fall. And the scripture says, some did fall on the stony ground and the birds of the air taken it away. Some fell just long enough to get enough roots to spring up and the thorns and thus choke it out. But some did go in good ground and it brought forth 100fold. He wants to call your attention to that. He wants to say that if this word in this Holy Ghost meeting where people were having hands laid on, it only applies to believers. Hallelujah. Are you a believer? It only applies to believers. There is no promise in here. But eternal separation from God to unbelievers. This promise is only to believers. Someone said to me not long ago said I don't care how much I don't believe. I said certainly not this is not for unbeliever. is for believer. &gt;&gt; They that believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The things we preach presently, they are not for everybody. Don't fear when everybody doesn't believe. It is for believers. Hallelujah. Don't hate them when they don't believe. They just have nothing to believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; God is covenant with Abraham and his seed in that. Listen to me. The right mental attitude towards any divine promise of God will bring it to pass. Are you a good ground? Amen. If you're a good ground, you will have a right mental attitude to the promise of God and that will bring it to to pass. I don't care what it is. I don't care what it is. If you can get a right mental attitude towards the promise for his promise, every word of God is his promise. Jesus said the word is a seed and every seed is a promise in there. And if you can if you can just take them seeds into your heart, no matter what it is for, God will honor it and it will bring forth just exactly what it promised. Oh my brother, sister, let us learn to take every word of God as a seed or promise in our hearts. He said it will never fail to bring forth what it promised it will bring. Amen. If he said you are going to be ahead, and not a tale. It is a promise in the word. It's not for unbeliever. For believers that will come to pass. If he said the eyes of the blind will come on, that's not for unbeliever. It is for believer. If he said the lamb shall walk, that promise is for believers. This son shall follow them. These are for believers. If he said our body shall be changed, our body shall be healed. These are promises for believers. If he said, "Whatsoever two shall agree about anything and they ask the father, it shall be granted." That is for believers. and whatever promise he gives. Amen. The right mental attitude. The right mental attitude towards every promise. So when you take the word, you receive it as a seed and you put it into your heart. You receive it as a seed. You put it into your heart and you say, "Amen, I believe it. Amen. I believe it. Amen. I believe it. It shall surely come to pass. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God will honor it. &gt;&gt; It will bring exactly what it promised. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. I have a few minutes. Let's let's talk a little bit about the water, the rain, which is another condition for the for the sea to grow. Water and rain is the same thing. You know, it talks about latter rain and former rain. [Music] If you read in the book of Joel chapter 2 vers 17, he says, "Be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice ye in the Lord your God. He has given you the former rain moderate and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain in the first month." and in the message anointed ones at the end time. A very good message for you to read. I want to quite a few things out of there. And after being in there a couple days, the Holy Spirit brought this scripture back to me. For the rain cometh off upon the earth to dress it with herbs. I believe this is somewhere in Hebrews. But ths and thistles live by that same rain. and whose end is to be burned and thorns living by the same lifegiving resource of God, the same that keep the wheat up. Then I understood that by Jesus said by their fruits they are known. You do not know them by the manifestation. [Music] Even the Pentecostals receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. That's for sure. Taught it. Said it and we believe it. But but you see we cannot know them because the baptism of the Holy Ghost baptizes you into the gifts into the man into gifts into the manifestation of the gifts. But by that we cannot know them. We are going to know them by the fruits. By the fruits they are known. Okay. Let me just read on so you can understand. Therefore, the rain dropping down upon the natural vegetation of the earth is a type of the spiritual rain which gives eternal life. Brother said, "You can be baptized, you know, with the Holy Spirit every day of your life and still go to hell." So you can see that brings the manifestation of the gifts and the the the the signs and the wonders. But that's just the anointing. It's just the anointing of it and and and both the seed and the tear we receive it. Okay? Follow me closely now. Dropping down upon the church for we call it the former rain and the latter rain. Let me go back a little bit now. For the rain dropping down upon the natural vegetation of the earth is a type of the spiritual rain which gives eternal life dropping down upon the church. For we call it the former rain and the latter rain. He'll explain it later for. It's a rain pouring out of God's spirit upon his church. Notice it's a very strange thing here. When them seeds went into the ground, however they got there, they were there were thorns to begin with, but there were the wheat that went into the ground also, and the herbs were herbs to begin with. And each hub was producing itself again showing that it was in the original beginning. And they were they will deceive the elected if it were possible because they getting the same reign, the same blessing, showing the same signs and the same wonders. They will deceive or shall deceive the elected if it were possible. Now a thorn cannot help being a thorn &gt;&gt; and neither can whe help being a witch. It is what the creator of each one determined at the beginning but it is the same rain. Now follow me closely. When the rain falls, it falls on the good and the bad on the wheat and the tears. And the manifestation of the rain will happen to both of them. But what shows who they are? I for you here a vision where brother Bam s said that he saw um you know uh you know the the wheat and he also saw the other tears both of them you know dry and they were praying for oh God send the rain and then the rain came and they were all happy they were all rejoicing they were all speaking in tong they were all doing signs and miracles rejoicing under the same ring. [Music] So how can you know now which one is which? You cannot know by the manifestation. You have to wait until the harvest time cuz that's when they are ripe. That's when they have matured now. That's when you can tell what is where. He said leave them. Let them go together. But in the end, at the time of the end, amen, what will he do? You know, he he will cause a harvest and he will take the tears, bundle them for the burning. How is he bundling them? We have seen in this end time bundling them by the kinds of churches. Those are the denominations. They have the same sense one as manifestation. They look like the true church but they are not the true church. So they are being bound in bundles of their denominations for the burning but the bride. Amen. Will be done what the wheat will be cut and taken into the b. Amen. Which is the rapture. Now the translation of the saints. Now I want to close this portion here for you of the of the of the latter and the former reign so you can get it clearly and I want to quote it for you out of the the regime of the ages. This age started just after the turn of the 20th century and as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost. We know that there must of necessity be a return of the dynamic power. The believers sensed this in their spirits and began crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century. [Music] That seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the spirit. It was then it was then that it was then uh it was then believed that this was indeed the long awaited restoration. And here he's speaking of Ausa. And now he says, "Oh, this the restoration we were waiting for the It was not for the latter rain for the latter because there's a former rain and a latter rain. But it says for the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain. The latter rain is the outpouring of the spirit, the manifesting of God in a mighty way. But the former reign, the teaching reign. Are you following? Maybe we'll get into these things a little deeper. We'll talk about it on its own. But here now, he says, "When Asusa came, It was they said, "Oh, this is the latter rain. Oh, this is the the restoration that God promised. Power of God has come. Signs and wonders. Oh, it's the resurrection of Pentecost." And that began the Pentecostal movement. And he said, "This is it. This is it." But says, "No, it was not the promised restoration. Why? Because the promised restoration of the latter rain will only come after the former rain has come and the former rain is a teaching rain. Are you following me now? How could this be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come? The prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turned the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal Father had not yet come. Thus, what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the quickening and the rapture had not yet come because they thought this is it. is the return of Pentecost. The only thing left is the rapture. But they did not understand that was not it because Malachi 4 prophet had not yet come. He was the one going to come with the former with a teaching reign which will restore the children. at the Pentecostal fire. So before the power of God will come before the quickening power comes finally translate us. Amen. Before that comes, we have to be restored fast. The altar had to be built again fast. There was a lot of mess. It needed to be cleaned up. by the ministry of Elijah the prophet. &gt;&gt; You see now he says in in it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of the spiritual blessing. is talking about that revival and the manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we have kept pointing out to you. I've talked about this for a few weeks now. How you see both of them manifest in the same power but some genuine and some false. You see, praise the name of the Lord. In it also was the devil power as men were under the control of devils. Yet no one seemed to realize it. Then to prove that it was not the real people even before a second generation had appeared. They organized and they wrote their unscriptural doctrines. and they built their own fences as every other group ahead of them did. And that's one proof. By the way, listen church, that's one proof of knowing the false vine. The first vine will always denominate. They will bring a ring around them. and circle everybody out and they will say we are the ones who are we are the only right ones everybody out of our denomination &gt;&gt; is wrong and lost we are the only ones we are the right ones spirit of denomination I wonder if it is not encroaching on the message believers now but let me tell you the true believer will never denominate. Brother said if they draw a circle and they circle you out, draw a bigger circle and circle everybody in. That is why we are not a denomination. We are interdenomination. We are interdenomination. Everybody is welcome here. This is not a denomination. The Catholics are welcome. The Muslim have come. The Anglicans have come. The Pentecostals have come. Every denomination is here because we are not a denomination. We are preaching a message of restoration. Amen. So this I will tell you church the latter and the former reign together. Amen. He said the restoration of the world with it with it brother listen with it will come the restoration of power the former and the reign together I believe we have truth I'm satisfied on that I believe the wheat is absolutely the shark is pulling away from This is what brother is saying. I may give a little preload on that tomorrow night. How the shark is putting away from the wheat. But the wheat has to lay in the presence of the sun light to ripen. This is atmosphere friend. We have to be in we are the way but we have to be in the presence of the earth light. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the light of the world. I I he says and that's what we are here for friends to stay in the presence of the sun till our little group of people here till it becomes so ripe to Christ it become bread on his table that's what I wanted to do think how long this has been going on and this was 1965 in the message things that are to be and he's asking think about how long this message has been going on but I can also ask you now think how long has the message been going on then he said 20 something years now I say more than 50 years and no organization [Music] Why? Here's the prophet asking of why it is the seed is the seed coming forming under the husk like this laying out. Now it's got to lay in the presence of the sun to ripen into the glorious grain like the one that went out into the fast. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. The real church that went down fast is coming right back through. Right through the stalk to come out. Another church. When the combine comes to pick it up, the life that went down in Luther, the life that went down in the Methodist, the life that went down in the Pentecost will come into the grain. It will go right into the grain and go out forming the perfect body of Jesus Christ. Just like the sun comes up in the morning, you can't look at no nature unless God testifies unless it testifies of God. Meaning all nature testifies of God. You don't even need a Bible to know there is a God. Just like the sun comes out in the morning. So will it be? No wonder the message. Shalom. The sun is up. It's a new day. What's happening? The seed which went down in all these church ages is now finally coming up. It's a new day. In this new day, it's going to ripen and be harvested. Which is that seed? You &gt;&gt; and me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; The the word is the sunlight. That is going to mature. the musicians can come that he's going to mature the seed. &gt;&gt; May God help us that we will stay in that atmosphere and as you stand on your feet I'll read something here. Now church we are we are teaching now but remember when you leave here start moving out of the shack now you are going into the grain but lay in the presence of the son and he says don't add what I've said don't take away what I've said because I speak the truth as far as I know it as the father has given it to Don't add to it. Just say what I say. The thing of it is just tell the people to come seek the Lord Jesus. That's what we should tell our friends, our neighbors, everybody. And then you yourself as a believer now, brother Joseph, he says, "Lay right in his presence. Just make love to him. Oh, help me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, son of God, I love you. Tender my heart, Lord. Take away all the filth and the love of the world and let me live holy in this present world. Shall we bow our heads for prayer? Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; it's my prayer too. [Music] &gt;&gt; Take away all the filth. Take away all the love of the world that I'll be totally dead to the world. That I'll be totally surrendered to you. that Lord we will have we will lay in the presence of the son. This is where we want to be. Help my brother my sister &gt;&gt; to lay in that praise. Oh Jesus Jesus in a place where we can hear the word a place where we can read a place where we can be in a place of prayer. Lord that you build within us a kingdom that cannot be destroyed. Bless each and every one of us. Pray that Lord you will give grant us the desire of your heart. The Lord will be changed to be like you. of [Music] Lord prepare to be a [Music] pure [Music] tried and true with thanksgiving. I'll be a living [Music] sanctuary for you. Oh Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary, true, dry, and holy, tried and true. With thanksgiving, [Music] I'll be a living sanuary. Oh. Oh, let us sing one more time. &gt;&gt; Lord, prepare me to be a sanua. [Music] You are holy, tried and true with thanksgiving. I'll be a living [Music] sanctuary. Oh.

Father Lord, as we are going to dismiss from this place today, we ask you that you'll help us [Music] a sanctuary for you, Lord, that you that we will lay in the presence of the sun. Then we will ripen up, Lord. Bless everybody, Father, who has been a part of this service. even bless us now as we're going to give. &gt;&gt; Bless every giver, Lord. And Lord, may you take what they have given and multiply it &gt;&gt; that it might serve your kingdom. We give you praise as we commit this into your hands in Jesus mighty name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Mother, if you can come and help us sing as the deacons bring the bags. We walk in the light. Beautiful light. &gt;&gt; We walk in the light. Oh, beautiful light. Oh, come the de.
