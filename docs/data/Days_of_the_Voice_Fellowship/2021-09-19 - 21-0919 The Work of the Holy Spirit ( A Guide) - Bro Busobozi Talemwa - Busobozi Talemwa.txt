there babu leader 2016 and i should say that the church there is now strong iraq amber government the pastor there was formerly from the pentecostals and is a man who loves god sergio aguero catherine and uh we also held a crusade trillionaire they were meeting at a tree under a tree and [Applause] we went and evangelized around the area chicken and it took he didn't get him a cartoon i don't remember how many people do we baptize i go to others about ten someone said to me about ten between five and ten yes so i don't remember the number but i think we need to stand with them because now they need to do their church construction donated he donated land yeah and uh this land was his but he donated it to the church and so uh ever since they are believing the lord to provide for the construction of the church and there has not been a message in that area i would like us to remember that so we can be able to stand with them in prayer and also i would like um to say brother joel i don't know if you have sorted it out i'd like to have pastor mugisa for you to greet us brother you would have to unmute i think you can use the micro the camera sound the camera sound can be able to the camera audio can be able to do that so you can greet us and then by the joel you'll be interpreting for him to english i think i think you would need to mute to first remove the audio your source of the speaker so that it doesn't give an echo can you try now [Music] you can see him you just have to do it on youtube okay can it right now i yes we can now hear you go ahead there is an echo i don't know can you mute your speaker can you mute your speaker can you first remove the speaker okay can you speak now okay can you speak now oh my god praise god resilience i'm marvel and pastor the

already all right amen we are trying out all this technology here god bless you so much have become a child you know we do not know when the rapture is happening [Music] we don't want to look at our situation now or our condition and say we cannot do anything for the lord i mean amen amen we don't believe in just sitting back and letting others do something whether you are small you are big do something for the lord whether we are two hundred over two db for just ten over coming whether we are one family or two families over family remember let's do something for the lord let us not say when i grow up i will serve the lord program until nicolas when our church amen amen we are not building our kingdom so you may need to so i would like to tell you what happened yesterday uh we had a wonderful meeting i see that some of you are not a part of that meeting because that you were caught up like dr peter you wrote back and told me that you were caught up at work i'd like to appreciate you for doing that wherever you could to let us know you are with us and no matter what is going on um we we we had several people come over and we were a total of 19 people who attended trabajan two hours and most of them were young people but the bible says the bibliogram is despised small beginnings so we therefore believe that it's just the beginning if the lord the program for our church construction has started in texas and just started in a very very strong way attending attendance uh with young people navajo pledging to do all they can [Music] we had even a young child i think the youngest that was able to play something was a five five year old [Music] and she pledged 1 000 every month [Music] [Music] get food tomorrow no one forced her to ready but she pledged by herself one thousand children sitting every month towards i think should be about 15 13 12. 11 12 11 12 and she has been having her books he has been uh putting her savings there come over here but she decided when she had on what what was going on she decided that she would break that box [Music] she gave away everything she has yeah what day have you never had enough everything towards the church construction mechanism you don't know what that means someone has been collecting money is one coin by one [Music] for us we shall we shall go and worship up on the mountain whether some remain to to be with their donkeys some are not moving tell them to stay with their donkeys you remember like when god told abraham [Music] whether i am going to give my son the only son that i have nina it is a very big offer oh who are you but i have to do it he didn't tell anyone he walked in this he went with his donkeys and when he reached where he was going to go up on the mountain where he will go and offer his son to the lord away he told the servants sacrificing his only son was to worship the lord and for the others which the lord willing we can use that for attaining land commander is that jessica that is our target we do not get there but to water to cayo then we shall get somewhere cut it back about 2.3 are uh around there [Music] was pledged yes so that's the total of all the pledges every month even the pastor from where he said i will give something [Music] this is an opportunity for you to be blessed i tell you to all those who have pledged something it is an opportunity and a rare one to serve the lord ukraine [Music] so if brother martin calls you and says please can you remit that money is the mobilizer is mobilizing you organize you remind you and then the others he's already been working as a treasurer so we'll continue with that others may be laughing of course not you i'm talking about the ones out there when they get to hear this they will laugh a second we are not dreaming [Music] god amen hallelujah amen it's not excitement it is faith in his word hallelujah amen amen shall we now stand katrina so that we can now prepare ourselves for the world amen i know i've already taken about 47 minutes for the announcement angle but it was worth it what would that be and uh it's the day of the lord still not quran i want you to now not limit god give him your time just put all the plants aside for now and take a kazoo let's take a come up back and concentrate on the sun with all your heart for your mind no more god will speak to you next time you are coming around so you can prepare to have you to take azeroth family and brother martin's family there everybody and uh my family and the saints family rose i noticed that our church is already we cannot feel this place anymore anymore we need to pray that god will let this project run so fast that we may be john 16 verse 13 yokan is like coming to all right i believe everybody is there exactly to say yo the name of jesus christ when he the spirit of truth is calm he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of his of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come in amen i mean god bless you you may have your seats come along let's speak to him a moment jesus we consecrate ourselves to you this moment father i am nothing without you that has a signature in the water my brothers are nothing without you and my sisters also never engineers them coming lord they cannot be able to know what it is that you are saying unless you revealed it to them come this morning i'm speaking i'm continuing on our subject we have had on the work of the holy spirit and my subject this morning will be a guide the first two or three services on this topic of the work of the holy spirit i spoke on training of a child now you may realize that training a child some of you may think well what does it have to do with the holy spirit and you will notice that actually a parent a parent physically speaking represents god in the life of a child [Music] and respecting your father and your mother is the first commandment with promise okay that if you respect your parents you are going to receive blessings in it you are going to live long and you will not suffer many people actually physically suffer because they do not respect represent the holy spirit in a childish life when the child's ability to exercise their free moral agency has not matured well the parent is there is there to you [Applause] and now we notice that a parent only even nurtures his child until only a certain time in life every one at one point in your life to sow spiritual seeds in your life but then come the time to say that you have outgrown their leadership and you have outgrown their control over your life and you reach a time whereby you are now going to exercise your own spiritual [Music] he was independent i want hallelujah amen then we shall not have so much trouble in the churches mechanisms i don't even have so much trouble on the pulpit that's why i'm saying that no man has a right to stand on the pulpit to preach the gospel before they are baptized into the holocaust because they still need to sit and beat up sometimes we can make notes of 10 pages five pages six pages and when i come on the pulpit i only cover a quarter of the first page what is it we have been studying it in the weekly bible studies and we have really been blessed hey that's where they doing the young people have been blessed all the meetings are on youtube and go through the phone every meeting is like three hours but while we are studying that book you see something was written in there one way i wanted one and he said that there are two identifications of the true church in every generation that is the first church it will always have the true word of god will also have the manifestation of the power of the holy ghost just talk about the holy ghost there will be manifestations [Applause] the thing and how can they be guided by the holy ghost when they don't have evidence god keeps his word in the brain he looked at me a little bit and said again god sent the holy ghost to lead the church now of course we have pastors we have a minister to another awareness and the prophet says that the pastor is the highest authority in the church how does he exercise that authority i'm [Applause] [Music] everybody make sure you mute your sound right so when sometimes you come to a meeting like this they said service again some people you know we just want to have a we don't want to have a good meal just want to have a snack for a real good meal today just make present yourself as if you're going to interpret for the whole day yes i mean hallelujah amen don't worry i'll not take you for the whole day just a few minutes amen probably 60 or so but i wanted to yield your time so you see that the holy ghost will teach the word of god again and he will stay with the word eras of things to come what does the holy ghost do remember i told you if you're a child of god you recommend your problem and you don't have the holy ghost you must receive the holy ghost and if you say what i have not and i can't remember your masks and [Music] [Music] you cannot the trouble we have today you know believers are in the realms of their teachers and tutors some of them have refused to graduate is no he said don't worry my boss the guy talk again don't go to the bishop talking to him go to the guy don't go to the air to anyone when you reach this railway amen he is the one that was even he is the one that will do it god has provided you a guide and he says god is provided with [Music] hallelujah jesus said i am the way yesterday i am the way i am the word he said i am the way you are and that way that person that way which was closed out of the human race hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah what does it say here i want to show you here in the in a quote here in the court uh leadership leadership please please bear with me and follow follow us [Music] education is fine are you hearing that education is fine you should go to school and learn more your parents should teach you your mama should teach you never mind actually in america america many schools do home school whereby a child goes through home school from grade one from kindergarten to grade 12. and then they just go and to journey university if they wish or they can do it online and then someone has graduated and has never gone across the classroom university kids [Music] is we want to see jesus hallelujah amen jesus yes hallelujah amen jesus christ oh [Applause] [Music] don't we sing it every day is the old time holy spirit and that devil won't go near it that's the reason people fear it is good enough for me i mean what is it it's that old time holy ghost if you teach a child for one year two years three years and they never go to another class what's wrong is something wrong your teacher can give you an education she can teach you something you have to learn it oh you know you can be assuming this is important you have to learn it where are we brother where are we truly hallelujah amen your mother can teach you to walk mama somebody quickly you are comfortable to walk you know you go your father can teach you how to be a businessman for what you have to learn that oh or not be gay you're not only jesus can give you eternal god to accept the person to jesus christ yes christians now but sometimes other leadership gets so much influence on us still we don't know what to do then that time that the teacher don't know what to do when that time comes whereby you are [Applause] or the next much future christian they say sometimes our leaders have so much influence on us about helping me if i should ever influence to reject the leadership foreign [Applause] [Applause] amen that's what we are believing that's why we believe this message hallelujah amen but sometimes maybe hallelujah amen he said but then we've got to accept jesus christ now he hadn't really know there is christian jesus alone can do that yes hallelujah i mean he says and though see this young man had achieved all these things in school he lost he says and by his parents and everything they are given the opportunity to choose do you want him to lead you where can i put him but it's your choice they made you do you want to be baptized in the holy ghost it is not his choice foreign for the church building projects [Music] that that one is very it's not ridiculous if you are going to mind about his business [Music] god help us that we will get into the realms where the holy ghost can lead us there's a woman in a prayer line and a child was sick what would okay you know bring out whatever was in her because she was just for justice a woman hallelujah amen he's bear with me now bear with me he says now and that one that's one thing that we have in life is to choose you know papa and mama they chose to have a nice little boy and girl like you are my mama [Music] just won't land card cardio no no i got very important mother say now you have to study [Music] but you have a choice no question you can do it or not do it you can say i don't want to see it you have a choice after a while you will have a choice of what girl you are going to marry what paul you're going to marry me you have a choice everywhere in life the consequences are someone told me my wife is a son to me my wife is a friend i laughed and kept quiet but i was almost saying but that was your choice [Music] this is your choice [Music] is do your planting way simply to whether you want to live after this life or just be a good popular person or a movie star or a dancer [Music] is give me a few more minutes i'm sharing only are very very important you need to sit and listen have interviewed some people say so well you just you may even sit there and then all of a sudden you realize you had the holy spirit [Music] yes christopher for me talk about the performer cathy he can't perform while she goes sleeping that's so good i survived the phone while moving of you to listen what did he say please bambi and i was standing by the mountain now i think i'm organizing and the ministers another way is that that i've started to embark on is 1962. this is where the message lies down to 48. [Music] [Music] i look i don't have time to go through this i probably i will in the coming services but here he was speaking of that which is in the book of revelation chapter 10. where by the it says that when the seven fathers add up their voices the time shall be no more you open your bible quickly okay let's read verse five and six because of time and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created the heaven and the things that are there in our and the earth and the things that they're in are and the sea [Music] does it mean [Applause] the time of [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] which is the mysteries contained in to cup of the pyramid or gujarat to cup off the pyramids to put the
