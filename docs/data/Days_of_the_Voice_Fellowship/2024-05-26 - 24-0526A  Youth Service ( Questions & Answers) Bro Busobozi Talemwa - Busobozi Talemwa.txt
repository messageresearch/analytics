========================================

praise God but we just thought for the interest of others who are waiting we don't take long to wait on that then to will take another 30 minutes so we have because we have several questions here some of which I think are very important and we need to deal with praise God Amen uh brother you looking at me very very sad are you okay you can see Deon if you're not okay and they can sort you yes you Brother Joseph he's saying me so we should smile right some of you are hungry but you know I I remember when we were still when I was still young as many of you we used to go CA from morning up to late in the evening no food and you have two services and no food so it shouldn't be a problem that uh if someone is saying me I'm fainting it means you never fast it means you never fast but I think we should have people who are resilient young people who here in Africa we are very strong you can even fast for you know for longer uh but for me I'm very tired I feel tired because of not only preaching but also yesterday we busy and driving and tomorrow we are traveling so just pray for me that God will give me strength so now um I'm not going to take a lot a lot of time my target is to spend here one hour so here is how we are going to do it it's not really a preaching it's not really a service of preaching uh I we just I just wanted us to have an interaction with a young people with a youth uh this one is also youth this one is 3 years old he should not have been here and the other one and the other one but uh it is all right I don't think will they will hear what we saying anyhow but uh you never know they can hear something which will be a blessing to them so now usually we have been having this youth service how many remembers how many times we've had it so far how many times have we had it so far I don't want to look this side I wanted to look only one side Brothers come this side kindly there chair here this sisters are very spirit filled Brethren don't fear to sit near them you don't have any issues there is even a chair in the middle there brother you can sit right there in the middle if you want or behind there whatever uh brother okay all right okay so now I can see everyone which uh is this the third time we are having this youth meeting oh okay so this is the third time and um I I always think it is very good for us to have this meeting a place where we can come and discuss and share and talk even when I'm talking and you feel you have a burning question or a burning comment we have a microphone here which we shall give you okay so this is like an interaction uh because sometimes we we preachers come they preach you go home they preach you go home they preach you go home and sometimes I feel that we need to have a moment like this where we can come you ask questions things things that you are thinking and also things that are serious and things that are are helping us to grow maybe you can ask something not for you only but for somebody else and you never know how it can impact their lives before I go into the questions the three things I wanted to remind you of I've spoken about it before uh that is killing Our Generation today not only today but really from time IM memorial three things number one and I want you to take this microphone I want someone a brother or a sister volunteer come quickly okay so you'll be giving this microphone to whoever ises up their hand you can stand there or stand this side there are three things um that I want you to help me explain or expound because I've Tau on it here before one is the pride of life two is the lust of the eyes and three is the last of the flesh I'd like us to begin the pride of life what what to you is the pride of life anyone with an answer please just show up raise your hand and then we shall give you the microphone so you can share on that did we understand each other sister fortunate you can give her the microphone she wants to answer I saw her wanting to put up the hand what is the pride of life God bless you amen for me in I was just trying to understand what your question has actually meaning but what do you understand by the pride of life when okay pride of life I'm seeing it in two ways there's the spiritual one and the life on Earth so I don't know what your meaning here on Earth maybe my pride of life be being rich yes attaining a better level of education and a good position thank you then spiritually oh my pride of life would be maybe know my spiritual life growing more and more and having a better interaction with God okay now you had your own definition of that but um uh thank you thank you can we please give our hand and now if you remember in the Book of Genesis there are three things that Jesus Christ did speak about rather Jesus Christ that uh um the Bible in the Book of Genesis it speaks about three things that Adam and Eve had to overcome and these are the three things you remember what the devil said the tree was was what do you remember the description of the tree the tree of knowledge it was what it was having those three things it was good for food what is that what is that last of the flesh uhuh it was what else it could make someone wise what is that pride of life right uh what else sorry are we together huh you can open the Bible and get there or give the microphone to someone so pleas to the eyes thank you God bless you give my daughter here another hand oh this is wonderful if every one of you were like would have been having a very good interaction so listen the tree could was pleasant to the eyes that is what the last of the eyes and also the tree was good for food meaning the last of the flesh what your body what desires what your eyes desire and also it could make one wise so you see this is the excuse the devil gave to to Adam and Eve enticing them with those things that they should eat the tree ahuh now do we remember the three temptations that Jesus uh suffered by the hand of the devil when he was taken up uh when he was coming down from fasting 40 days and um three things there were three things how many remember and can you take us through them yes yes Sister Mary God bless you amen I think the first Temptation was that Jesus was hungry yes he was hungry he told him to change the stones into bread into bread the last of the flesh yes what your flesh desires number two then the second one was he took him up on the mountain yes and showed him the beautiful things and he said if you Bow Down and Worship me I will give you everything what is that friends sorry the last of the eyes number three I'm trying to remember the third word to worship him yes he said if you if you if you can jump on from up to down the angels will be able to they will carry you you will not fall down you see you can go like woohoo you like you just not fall down and then that's the pride of life God bless you Sister Mary let us give her a hand please now friends do you see the trend that Adam and Eve had to overcome that they failed and Jesus also had to overcome that did he fail he overcame so Jesus overcame what Satan failed to overcome and that's why what I was preaching is we can only overcome in him in Christ we can only boast in him because he's the one who overcame everything we in our natural uh uh in our natural life could not overcome K today we are still fighting those three things H by the way each of you each of us here is fighting those three things there is no other battle we are fighting there is no other demon we are fighting it's only those three things that's why bam said the greatest enemy that I have is myself it isoss to live a Christian life but you see those are the three things you have to overcome everything else whatever you might said this one that one it is all bound up in there if you can overcome the pride of life against you overcome the lust of the flesh you overcome the last of the eyes the the pride of life did I say the pride of life the last of the eyes is theala you know I mean the last of the eyes you know you can see you can be passing a road and you see someone who has a very nice building and you're like oh I wish this was mine and then the devil begins telling you you can do this and this and this to go and get it you see someone you know uh achieving something good in life instead of supporting them and praying with them and being happy for them you feel like I wish it was mine because you have seen it and you desire it for yourself you see the the the the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pr we are have we are having such battles and we never seek for help one of the things that I always want to tell you when we have meetings like this is that the office of a pastor is not there as a picture or as an image for you to look at or as someone who just comes and preaches and he goes away take advantage you know some of you who go to school when you in a holiday others who are not in a holiday you know doesn't matter what uh kind of things you are doing in your life maybe you are working or maybe you you know you you go to school but you not in Holiday find time if you're going through things it could be one of these and you you need help you need help one thing that I realized is that that here in Africa even adults it is very difficult to hear someone saying that they need help you be there needing help but you cannot humble yourself to to go and say you know what I need help I'm going through this I need help how are you I'm fine is everything fine oh everything is all right God is giving us Grace but you know you are going through hell and you know the devil is squeezing you in a corner if you can't come to seek for help the devil will overcome you we should humble ourself and always seek help when we when we can get it people backer slide and others um you know find themselves trapped by the devil because they never sought help so one of these meetings some of these meetings is to give help by force to give you help by force because you don't come to seek for it so I'm bringing you here to give it to you by force ask your questions because I need to hear how are you how are you are you growing there are certain questions I've seen and I was like this person is very either young in the young physically or or they very young in the spirit some questions I was looking at so it questions show me how are the people are they growing people are not growing are we getting somewhere so and some questions are very mature and we'll begin right away to go into these questions if you have any question right there you just raise up your hand and we will uh give you the chance so the plan is to go until 4 um uh around 4:20 that will be 1 hour from now so that that will be as much as we will be able to go and then uh we shall release you now I have a few questions here asked by you um we are going to go one by one someone asked a question Kane went to the town of no he says no but it is nod and married and gave birth with her he says with her who was Kane's wife praise the name of the Lord ah sincerely I would like to know who asked this question because this one is a mature believer who asked this question ah brother Solomon let us give him a hand very good question now straight away let's go to the scripture and we answer this question right away and then we go to others um uh we will we can read many scriptures but uh I think I was I wanted to read this scripture in Genesis but I think all of us know where it is uh I'll just um uh read for you a quote here okay in the message questions and answers thank God we have a prophet who already had questions and answers and we can copy from there Hal Hallelujah so uh questions and answers on Genesis 53 0729 the question is who was Cain's wife and brother bam says so Cain married his sister then they went over there in the Land of Nod now we get into a deep subject if we went a little farther and I'm glad you you never asked any further than that like where was those giants that was in the land of that day because we can also go and talk about those giants how did did the Giants come into view but of course we know that the Giants came as a as a a result of the mixture of the two of the people from the land from the Lage of Cain and the Lage of Seth inter Maring and then the Giants came out as a result so some people are thinking that Giants were Angels no no no they were not Angels it was just the Bible says sons of God saw the daughters of men and they married who are the sons of God those from the line of Adam which is the line of Seth and the daughters of men were those out from the linage of Cain so when they intermarried with these ones then they brought forth Giants at that time so we see here brother bam says okay we not go deeper into those things but uh he says Cain's wife was his sister K married his sister and they went to the Land of Nod he didn't go to the Land of Nod and then found he a a wife to marry he actually made the land of no he and his wife were the ones who went there and they called the land of no um then you would say how do you uh end up with that answer now if you read in the Bible usually in the Bible they do not record the birth of girls they usually only record the birth of boys um how many people did Jesus Christ feed sorry 9,000 5,000 but do you actually know it was much more than that it might have been like 15,000 that number 5,000 does not include women and it does not include children because in the Jewish tradition women were never counted when they were counting anything and even the the uh when they they were announcing B so now like the Bible announces the birth of Adam's children like Abel and then Seth and then others but do you ever see the Bible announcing any daughter of Adam there is no record of any daughter of Adam are you saying Adam gave birth only to Sons So Adam also had daughters but we never know who they were we never knew not only did Cain marry his sister but also we believe Seth married his sister because there was no other people on earth at the time praise the Lord so that is answered that way are you satisfied brother you are not satisfied oh okay you're satisfied all right uh how many are blessed by that question you see if you had not come to the youth service you would not have got that answer and someone else will ask you out there and you will be looking around you don't know the answer but when you come to a service like this you can quickly get that answer from the message now someone says God bless you fellow youth why do I always get disappointed in God I always believe for something but it does not happen and it hurts me a lot and I think this question I'll answer it together with this because the handwriting is the same and it looks like it is the same person that uh asked the question says God bless you fellow youth why am I still in this bad way of living my parents don't earn enough we are poor yet I have been praying my whole life and believing Pastor why okay very good question now the other first question says I think she's a sister the way she's writing or he I don't know some younger men write very well so he says I always get disappointed in God now we shall begin there right there that's where your problem is you get disappoint appointed in God now I could read a ton of scriptures but I'll read whatever will come into my mind uh the scripture says we shall read um here in the Bible in the book of um I Isiah wait a moment let me see okay um we'll read Isaiah chapter 40:31 but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint now sister or brother whoever ask this question the first thing that I want you to know is God is not a man and God does not lie whatever God says in his word which we we call today the Bible he fulfills it because he says he's faithful man is not faithful but God is faithful now today I was preaching faith and I said the only thing we need to have is faith the Bible says without faith can you finish the scripture remember if you're hungry you go see the Deon there so that you are all Lively if you are very hungry and you can't talk you're about to faint go see Deon Mond out there he will fix you you will fix you so uhhuh I believe brother Marin has just been fixed right now so the scripture says without faith it is impossible to do what to please God and they that come to God God they that come to God must believe what that he is and is's a rewarder of them that diligently remember diligently seek him when you are seeking after God you must be diligent you must you must be honest you must be sincere you must do it with all your heart you you you you must not do it because of your mother because of your father because of how others I saw so and so praying and they they gave a testimony like this let me also do like them no you come to God on your own that's why I said today it's not about you praying in the church no you have to have a personal devotion a personal time with God so when you say you prayed and your prayer was not answered how did you pray because the Bible says that they pray and they don't receive what they pray for because they pray am Miss how do you pray am Miss by praying out of the will of God it's just like me right now saying oh God may you provide me a wife that prayer will not be answered cuz God has already provided me a wife I'm married you understand brother so if I'm praying such a prayer it is a miss and we you have heard people who come and say oh God spoke to me and he showed me in the in the vision even a number of a of a a woman he told me to marry and this man who is saying this is married and then you find that he's getting a second wife because that they found in the dream or one person gave them a vision or one person spoke to them a prophecy that so and so is not your wife so and so is your wife so I mean how do you know the will of God is in his word the will of God will always be in his word so as long as your prayer is according to the will of God oh my there's much I can say about this but I will not be prolonging things but I would say this there are many things you can even do and God will not be pleased if you don't do it out of faith for example you can come and give money to the basket and you know you put your money but God will not be pleased with your offering did you know that why how come that you can give money and God will not be pleased with your offering it is not what you give or how much you give or it's not even about the giving it's about the Revelation and the prophet told us Revelation is faith faith is a revelation of the will of God you understand so if God has revealed himself to you then you go to prayer and I'll give you my testimony you said here that you pray and things don't happen your whole life and and and and you you have been a Christian your whole life you have been praying your whole life and you have been believing your whole life and you say that you always believe for something but it doesn't happen and it hurts you a lot and I'll tell you this sister oh brother the very first thing you need to do is to understand is that you have to develop you yourself a personal relationship with God I want you to imagine if I was your friend but every time you meet me you ask me for things will that relationship continue for so long will it come on answer me if you're not so so hungry and you're not about to faint you will not that relationship will stop it will not go so long because our relationship is based on me giving you and you receiving but I believe as it is in every healthy relationship it should not be whenever you go before God you're praying oh God there is no day you will ever come before him to worship His Majesty to tell him how great he is how about changing your strategy instead of coming to ask for things come to worship him develop a relationship with him first get to know him get to know him because the Bible says to know him is life and peace if you get to know him you get you develop a relationship with Jesus Christ now it is easier to ask a friend for something than to ask a stranger for something because when you ask a friend a friend will not not disappoint you because he's concerned about your relationship that you have with him or with her so in this way sister or brother you need to develop a relationship with Jesus Christ first be filled with the Holy Ghost if you you are not and if you believe you are then you need to change the way you approach God don't approach him by asking for things some sometimes you just even need to just simply worship him and then you realize he will give you whatever you have desired without even as opening your mouth to ask for anything many of the big things in my life it was not because I prayed so much or I fasted so much it was because I yielded my heart and and and I focused on serving God with all my life like I gave him my life and then he also decided to bless me with a few things in my life now you say that you have been you are poor I want you to change that you are not poor because you see this is what the devil has made you to believe there is no person who can be in Christ and be poor by the way it is impossible it is impossible if you are in Christ you cannot be poor you cannot what is poverty can someone Define for me what poverty is you all cannot Define it because you're all poor or what switch it on it's a permanent state of Lu okay that's a an interesting definition poverty is a permanent state of lack and it's a very good one now who is the richest man on earth can somebody answer that yes who is it sorry helon h ah Elon Musk Aon musk Aon musk ah okay Aon musk according to you is the richest man on earth now maybe I will tell you the richest man on earth the the richest man on earth is a Christian do you know why because God is the creator not only the owner but also the creator of Heaven and Earth and everything that is in there by the way he's the owner of the whole universe whatever you look at it is God who created it do we believe that we believe in the existence of God and if we do then he is the creator of the earth and the fullness thereof now if that God was in you think about it would you be poor it is impossible that's why the only only rich person on earth is a Christian a man or woman who has known God and who has had a personal relationship with Jesus Christ the problem that we have people believe things about God but they don't believe God they they receive things from God but they don't receive God but if you can receive God you will never ever call yourself poor again in fact don't even said these words because the moment you begin to say it you prophesying poverty over your life never accept poor I will tell you a little bit of my story I was born in a village and uh I I saw when we were sleeping do you know um what is this uh I am I'm sorry forgive me for dwelling on on these two questions for a while because I feel this person needs to hear this get is it called a poly sack a sack and then inside they put grass which has dried up they dry it and then you put it inside there and then they tie it and that's a mattress and you don't have bed sheets you are sleeping on it and maybe your mother can give you his gas her gas and then you put on it and and cover yourself how many have ever slept in that here uhuh I would have said those are my fellow poor people but but let me tell you we don't call ourselves poor now to you I I even believe whoever asked this I believe whoever asked this has never slept on a sack with grass in it as a mattress but you call yourself poor it's an insult of God that's how we we where I was born in a grass touched house and um later on when we went to the city our city was mende mende is here we call it a village but at that time it was a city for us and I would walk I don't remember how many kilometers but several of them because we would walk all the way from downtown mend to the other side near the barracks where there is the school H we used to I used to go to aname school because my parents couldn't afford private school so all my um uh primary we went to an army school where we were paying public I mean we're paying nothing almost but it was also still a lot for us and uh we went there and and you would walk you would not say thatth it is too long I will not my father I remember he took me to school one time when he was taking me for registration in P1 and and and the following day I took myself God have mercy how many here in P1 I'm see I'm trying to look around oh that one is n p one come come here he goodness I was very young but I think how old are you five ah no some of us were starting P when we were big I was not your age who is seven years here you are seven come here I was this young boy's age and I started taking myself to school walking about 5 to 10 kilomet to school and Crossing roads some of them highways and then you go and you walk to school and every single day and sometimes they chest you for school fees you go back and then again you go back and I'm telling you God bless you and I'm telling you we me from growing up I never believed I was poor because even our parents never told us we were poor so we don't we do not believe we were poor we believed we were Rich because we had God because at that time we were still in the Anglican church and um we were believing in that to a Revival so they always told us if you have God you are rich if you have God you are rich and um we never behaved poor we never thought we were poor and because of that all of us with all my other siblings you see we've made it in life we've got families and you know moving on with life I cannot say really I'm poor I I'm not poor many times these days even when I say I am rich people think that I am proud because I'm saying I'm rich but me I keep saying it I am rich and if you call me poor I am your enemy from that day I am not poor now poverty is permanent lack is that the definition is when you lack and you lack permanently from year to year you lack now you cannot have permanent lack when you have the provider of everything and the creator of everything in your life you can never do that and I think to me it is a mindset change you begin you begin by changing your mindset refuse poverty to begin with refuse that mindset that you are poor refuse to accept that you are poor you know I used to we used to walk on feet even until got married I was walking on foot we did not even have a bicycle and someone would bring a car and then all the dust goes in your eyes and on your good clothes and I'll be like oh don't worry my dear we shall also buy a car now we have a car and and we are the ones now taking them s so so in other words friends it is what you have in your head if your head is telling you are poor you will be poor if your head is saying you are rich then you will indeed make it sometimes it is the mentality the mentality that you have that's why I encourage you to keep coming to hear the word to read the Bible because no one person can read the word feed on the word and accept what the devil has told them about themselves you will accept what God has spoken about yourself it won't be about your feeling it will be about the word of God and what you believe uh for it to be in your life and some of you that's how you going to break poverty you may have you may have come from a home which didn't even ever drive or didn't ever have a bicycle but you can break the cycle God does not only give us spiritual blessings he gives us also physical blessings you see so sister or brother please don't say that ever again in your life you that your parents don't ear enough and we are poor you are not poor they may not have be they not be earning enough but you are not poor and you are saying you have been praying all your life and believing now that's why I read you that scripture keep believing but change your strategy on how you're praying on how you're approaching God h and then uh do not confess poverty but what you do is the Bible says they that wait upon God shall do what renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles when I reached Senor to there about um uh I did not have tution again and I I couldn't go to school so I went cuz I believed I had a rich God so I went I I told God I said God if this message is true if this message is true supernaturally open a channel for me to have tution without begging anyone that I always added that one whenever I needed money I always told god without begging without begging cuz i' never believed in begging from that time I mean since that time I never believed in it don't believe in begging whenever you you lack something you run to someone please borrow me and when you borrow you don't pay them and that's why you remain in poverty because even when you borrow a lot and God provides for you you will not even remember to pay tithe because you see you have a lot of debts you will always be in debts you will always so in other words don't don't believe in those kind of things if you don't believe in something God will be God will make us sure he will not allow you to go that that that Journey but if you believe in it well of course it will happen to you so which story was I telling you senior two I didn't have tution and then I prayed I said God if this message is the truth I usually wanted to put God to a challenge if this message is the truth provide for me without begging and let me have my tution and I would pray and pray and then after I pray that I thank him I begin to appreciate him and believe it is done I begin singing songs it is done the good transaction is done say it is it is already done it is finished oh my Higher Ground I feel I'm on Higher Ground I feel is already done even before you rece you receive anything even before you see something tangible by the way those are the things younger people be should be doing in prayer because you see these things I'm imagine whoever ask this you in a tough situation but how are you dealing with a tough situation when situation gets tough you also should get tough in prayer in prayer you challenge God you go to God In Prayer you challenge him you know you you you come to church you fast you pray you you know that's what you do you you step up your game as well and I did and I waited I I I challenged God and it's a very long story I don't have time to go to eat but I'll tell you what from that time from that very time my my tution was always paid at school without me paying a before we even start the time until I finished school my dear God gave me a lifetime B if we go in the details we shall not finished but I would have loved to explain to you how I got the B and how my tution was being paid but supernaturally God showed me who will pay how they will pay and what they will tell me and those people for sure they wrote me they told me how they will pay how when they will pay exactly as God had showed me already in the Vision By Night God speaks God provides is Jehovah Gyra so if you believe in him always even before you go to Mommy or to Daddy to ask them I need this I need that don't rely on anyone I never accept to rely on anyone if you rely on some people they will forsake you I mean they will abandon you sometime or they may fail you and then you will you your faith was upon a person and a person disappoints you and then you you you are grieved with God isn't that unfair it is unfair if you hope the Bible says cast be a man who trusts in another man but you you are trusting in a man and when a man fails you then you again you you angry with God but trust God God cannot fail you you not even saying any amens is it because I said we having an interaction but I'm speaking the word of God okay if you trust on God God cannot fail you you you come to him you tell him I don't even believe my parents have money but Lord may you provide give them provide pray for them before you go to ask them and then see if God won't provide all right so don't be disappointed with God be disappointed in yourself that you do not have enough Faith to approach God in the in the in the right way but don't be disappointed also in yourself anymore because I've taught you on how to approach God and this problem will be over all right so we have another question here um how can I know God's Good Will and his permissive I he says perversive but I think it means pervis permissive will so that I cannot walk or do his permissive will very simple you can only know the will of God I think I answered that in the beginning you can know the will of God if it is the word of God if whatever you are going to do does not break scripture okay whatever whatever you are going to do when someone says H uh I've got you a job ah he paying you 2 million a month Hallelujah God has done it um but that job you are going to be working Monday to Sunday or rather Sunday to Sunday and um up to 88 to up to 6:00 p.m. and uh it's paying you very well though but you won't get any time to come to church throughout the whole week you only appear when you are sick when you deceive them that you are sick let me ask you is that the will of God for you to do that job why why someone give them a microphone let them answer why raise up your hand somebody and articulate it properly for the people God bless you amen uh the reason is one you will not have time to come for Fellowship yes but also too you will not have time to pray or read the word of God yes so but how can you now know it cuz someone can say it's all right if I don't go for Fellowship it's all right I can go once in a while after all I I send my tithe so how can you can you convince them it's not the will of God yeah because if you do not attend Fellowship it becomes very easier for the enemy to help you backslide yeah yeah I I agree with you if if if you come to church at least because we come to church to hear the word of God to correct us and to rebuke us so if that is not happening with time you will and and what does the word of God say about a believer not attending church or attending church he said we should not forsake Fellowship thank you as simple as that the word of God says forsake not the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is if you want the scripture raise up your hand I'll show you the scripture by the way if I I mention some scriptures and you want to know where they are you raise up your hand and ask me I'll give you to you right quick so you see forsake not you want it you have a question yes yeah I've already answered ah okay give her a microphone okay my question is if I'm a Christian and maybe I'm I'm going to get married and there are two people brother a brother B all of them are in all of them love God all of them are Christians what they do is in the will of God but maybe God's maybe God has planned for brother B then for me I look at that two all of I within the will of God and I go for it to still be a permissive won't it still be a permissive sorry why would it be a permissive will when if you're going for brother a because if God has said it's maybe if God wanted brother B oh but all of them are within the the will of God they all good then for me they're all believers yes yes they are all believers and you just decide to choose the other one that you like better than the one that God told you God has not told you it is B but it is your choice so how do you know is the will of God all right that is a very good one as well okay if that the question is in that perspective then I will answer it this way I read you a quote right quick here let me find it it says that um [Music] okay all right let me find uh uh the answer for you here where it says the will of God in important it do anybody know the quot I'm looking for all right I've got it uh questions and answers 1961 uh question 163 brother bam was asked how do you feel is the best way to find the Lord how do you feel is the best way to find the Lord's will in some important matters and by the way this is a very good question for the young people because there are many things you you you you are you feel to do should I do this or I should do that should I do this or should do that both of them are good but you don't know what God wants you to do right how many have experienced that no one uhhuh yes now we are talking now you have to respond to me we we we are brother de if you see someone fainting call them outside give them something and then they come back because we want to finish 1 hour okay the answer I tell you dear friend the best way to find the will of God in some important matter matters is prayer okay now prayer and then he goes ahead to explain now here's a wonderful little thing here if you have a matter that's very important now here is a way I do it now he gives his own example I take it before the Lord and it's always been my strength I wait wait upon the Lord and see what he says because for him God deals or was dealing with him through Visions he would see a vision and he would know ah God wants me to to do that and I just let myself neutral to itat but many of you go to prayer when you already know God me I love brothers so and so may I love sister so and so oh God may you may you may you speak to me about her about him no God will never speak to you like that because you are not neutral you see he says I just let myself neutral to eat I I don't care I don't take either side and say now heavenly father now because now in my case most of the time if it's very important I wait on a vision but many people God doesn't deal with with Invision so there I wouldn't advise you to do that I wouldn't advise you to always wait on a vision or always wait on a dream I've not seen any dream I've not seen any Vision it may never come because if God is not dealing with you in visions and dreams and on other things you are doing in your life why will he deal with you in a vision and in a dream in this issue you get the point every one of of us has a way God deals with what with them so therefore I wouldn't advise you to do that because it's just some people that has visions and some does have something else okay where you do something else that I couldn't do or maybe your way of serving the lord I do something that you couldn't do see God deals with us different and so I would I would if I was in your place I didn't have visions from before the Lord I would just wait upon the Lord and say Lord now you show me you show me which decision to make show me and then you you feel the way you feel led to do it let me just go this way then wait just a little bit pray a little more then wait a little longer and see which way which side you lean towards which way the spirit now the father in my heart you you know father in my heart you know it doesn't matter I I just want you to know to I just want to know what you want me to do about it now that's the way I do about meeting sometimes I feel kind of led to go this way or that way then I feel I would follow that way that's the way to do it because it's in prayer then you are doing the best you what you can and I believe this my friends as Paul was in the New Testament in the days going by he was between two Straits two road which way he should go and he started on the wrong road and he got a Macedonian call he was walking on on another road but God called him to go to where to another road and I believe if you are making a decision for God and do it the best that you can I believe God will correct you and you will see that you don't go wrong I believe God will do it how many believe that amen so that's the answer the matter put it in prayer wait upon God and if you don't have to wait on a vision or a dream or whatever some people God deals with them in visions and in dreams really but it's not a standard the prophet is saying it's not the standard which God has a special way you can know surely God has spoken to me or I feel to go this direction But whichever direction you feel you want to take just take it and uh after prayer as long as you have been praying neutrally now let me emphasize on this no those ones which have been down have answered them you are going to mix them up okay now if you've been praying and there is a this come come here stand here and you stand there stand there and stand there okay come come come quickly we don't have time now you are seeing this sister you your brother no problem you're seeing this sister you are seeing the other sister now you want to choose but you don't know the will of God you are saying but deep in your heart you feel you you want this sister but this one also you want but this one also like oh God which one now should I choose ah and then you go God you know I want sister B you know I want this sister so much but show me your will so you already choosing for God you get you're already choosing for God it could be a job also it could be something else you are not neutral so what you do don't come this side oh God show me about this sister speak to me about her say you have already made up your mind so don't do that come and be neutral you want to know cuz you don't know whichever side God chooses you what you are happy with it so you see God will not speak to you about this one will not speak to you about the other one but you'll be in the midd you'll pray oh God I'm I've left the other I've left the other but I just I'm here I want to know your will I want to know your will Lord speak to me I mean you press sincerely before God and what God does is he may show you a vision if he deals with you in Visions or a dream or whatever but sometimes you you may never see a vision or nothing which is actually many times you don't have two wait to see one H Believers these days they don't want to do anything without a dream who told you that's how God works you don't you need to wait for a dream many of those dreams come because you are you you are full in the stomach they are not even from God by the way sincerely many of those dreams are not spiritual dreams or maybe it is something you are thinking so much about and then you think then when you go to pray and then you sleep and then that sister comes when she's your wife or your brother when she's your husband ah God has spoken to me it is not God it is because your thoughts were all about that person and then you think it was God it wasn't okay so don't think about it that way be neutral pray wait upon God after prayer wait a little longer okay after you've waited you feel like sincerely God is pushing you this way you wouldn't have wanted but God is pushing you this way it's all right start it let us see how it will go start it cautiously prayerfully every step prayerfully don't just go prayerfully you move and then along the way God may tell you and I've heard many examples like that God may tell you no it is not this one it is actually the other one ah and then now you are wondering I thought it is this one God said no but it is the other one you see and then you will go with what God tells you cuz what God always speaks that's what one thing that I know God speaks God speaks if you're sincere God bless you if you're sincere and you're neutral in your prayer God always speaks and that's how brother bamas told us to find the will of God and the permissive will of God is when number one it's against the word number two God speaks against it and you still go continue um so that is usually a problem okay have I answered that one well how do you understand that you have seen the right person to go with in marriage someone ask this one I think it's the same question do I need to answer that it is the same right if we agree say Amen all right it's the same way you know the right person first of all the matter you take it in prayer and uh uh maybe one thing I can add is you cannot find the right person among the gods if you are sheep you get you can't find the right person person among the Gods when you are sheep I've pray that God showed me the other one can't God can't do that right it is just your desires and lasts but if God is going to show you somebody the right person he will show you the right person among his children amen that is one thing I needed to add and then the rest is what I just said okay what will happen to the body of Jesus after the a thousand years of Reign on Earth will it vanish away I do not know I do not know but uh I'll give you a scripture here in the book of um says then cometh the end uh let me just find it for you here first Corinthians uh um uh just a moment uh 1 Corinthians 15 25 uh okay we'll begin from 24 then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God he's talking about Jesus the son even the father father when he shall have put down all Rule and authority and power where is that going to be of course certainly I believe that will be at the end of the Millennium uh for he must Reign till he has put all enemies under his feet The Last Enemy shall that shall be destroyed is death for he has put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under him it is Manifest that he is expected which did put all things under him that is accepted for him he has not been put under him in other words then verse 28 and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that putteth all things under him that God may be all in all I think that that one answers all of it right okay if you feel it was not sufficient or you did not understand the scripture you can come meet me for further explanations okay uh this question says where does a person pay his or her tithe in case they are not settled in one Church due to job transfer in different places um number one do you have a church home do you have a home Church no matter where you go to work cuz you can be going to work in many places like you have said here it doesn't mean that your father and your your mother has changed because you are now going to many places does it mean that if you have a home you have a what a home east and west but home is what home is best so it doesn't matter where you go for work cuz you're going here you are going there you going here you going there but you know that I have a home and I'm still going to go back to my home church then you still continue paying tithe to your home church I believe that but in some instances where for example you might find that uh you you now shift and uh you go to a place and uh you are going to be there indefinitely Or you have a permanent job in a a location that uh uh you're going to stay there for a few years and maybe you don't know even if you'll ever go back home you no longer attend church in your home Church you no longer uh get spiritual nourishment from your home church but you have found another church where you are you are now fellowshipping at I I would think it is right for you to pay tithe where you're fellowshipping at because you find people and this happens a lot especially in the churches here in the city you find people they are coming from Caba Mido they are working here in campala but um uh you know then they go back they come they go back they come but because they think that they are part of the church in campala they no longer send their tith back home and yet they go back home every 6 months or everyone but if someone has moved permanently here and you know starting life here and you are deceiving yourself to be sending money every time home because it is your church no you've really changed the fellowship because you pay tithe in the storehouse that's the clue there you pay tithe where Malachi chapter 3 you pay tie in the storehouse what's the storehouse where you get what food where you get food you know so that's where you pay your tithe from where you get your spiritual nourishment uh that's where you pay your tithe from I think there's nothing much to add on that one uh I hope that you young people that are moving moving you are going to to the Deacon if not please stay so you can get the answers brother Deon I think that brother is really dying he's about to faint you better take care of him okay now um someone asks what do these Bible verses say please quickly um read for me Psalms 127 2-3 somebody Whoever has a Bible open up open up and read it and then we shall explain it uh he says what do they mean Psalms 127 2-3 and Proverbs 24 another person open Proverbs 2433 to 34 Psalms 127 to 2 to 3 Proverbs 24 33-34 and we are getting late because the students now must go to school it is already 4 so I have about 20 more minutes yes okay put switch it on it says is it vain for you to rise up early to sit up late to eat the bread of Sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep yes L children are an inheritance of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward I I believe the question is on verse two not vers on vers three uh it's about sleep because the other Proverbs must also be about sleep I also believe God gives his beloved sleep there are people who never sleep by the way when they go at night they have sleep problems if you are here and you have sleep problem problems you cannot sleep you need prayer and I'll pray for you and God will deliver you it's very simple God should give you sleep if you his beloved whereby you sleep and you don't even yes you are the one who asked this question but what I try to mean is uh there's a video I watched yesterday and it was saying that uh God provides to his children while they asleep and then that Guy brought another verse he said but another another Bible verse saying that when you sleep poverty will come like a thief yes so that's what I was trying to mean yeah Proverbs talks about that poverty will come like a thief not lacking sleep not not lacking sleep yes no you have to understand uh the first verse in Psalms is talking about rest God gives his beloved rest really remove the word sleep to rest they are not anxious for anything they they can rest okay at night God the Bible says he created night for what for for sleeping and day for work but you find people they are busy during day they also they can't also sleep during night they have to take sleep medication that's I always approach that verse that way to mean that we God has not given us a portion to suffer at night if you want sleep you get sleep you see for me I I believed that I've I always applied that upon my life even if I am not tired like some people when they are tired they can't sleep others when they not tired and they're Disturbed they can't sleep me if I want sleep I just go and put my head on the pillow and I sleep simple so the Bible says God gives his beloved sleep now uh Proverbs talks about resonance sleep there is talking about less not resting okay don't mix it up in Proverbs it saying when you are lazy you you are not wanting to work poverty will come and strike you so in other words don't be work when at night during daytime okay time is for what day time is for work night is for sleep so you cannot tell me oh doesn't mean now we shall be awake all the time we are working I'm working during night and day because I don't want to be poor no but of course rich people don't sleep much that one know so if you want to be rich you should not sleep a lot some people who enjoy sleep they become very poor don't abuse sleep sleep reasonably okay sleep don't now some people sleep 10 hours imagine at your age and you're sleeping 10 hours and you expect to be rich when Pastor comes and yeah I receive it I'm receiving and I'm going to be rich you will be poor if you're sleeping you are sleeping too much reduce on your sleep you find someone sleeping during daytime and you ask them why are you sleeping I've seen some of these younger men why are you sleeping you know the Bible says God gives his beloved sleep and is's Ying during that time other young people are very busy going there to find what to do you you are Ying at during the time that God gives his beloved sleep that kind of sleep will make you poor you will be poor in fact read that scripture read read Al Proverbs because you want to see how the Bible talks about how poverty will come to you read it somebody you have it yes Proverbs 23 I believe it is 24 33 ah no one okay yet a little sleep a little Slumber a little folding of hands to sleep so shall thy poverty come as one of one of that Trav and th no let me read it again th what continue th what and an armed armed man let me read again poverty it is understandable poverty will come to you like a thief he saying it will come to you like someone who travels it will just come and snatch you a little Slumber a little whatever of folding hands you see he's explaining this kind of sleep is the one of what folding hands that's why me I'm I'm telling you and I'm encouraging young people to work when you go break off from school don't just go there and be sleeping at school studying the time let us just sleep don't sleep like that find something you can do if you have nothing to do come ask us for trucks and begin Distributing them in the neighborhood let people here and come to church then you working also okay but don't just be there sleeping they call it winter oh I've been waking up in Winter and then you sleep the whole time you know you just wake up you go for football then you come back and sleep you're going to be poor until you learn how to work so I believe that you should work always be focused and find yourself busy don't be lazy and I think about the tithe I also answered it correctly you PTI where you Fellowship regularly okay not where you visit for Fellowship but where you Fellowship regularly okay um why are sisters always misunderstood okay when we are friendly to Brothers some that they are dating aren't we supposed to have brotherly love when we talk it's all right let us hear Let Us hear this argument this sister is serious aren we supposed to have brotherly love when we talk allative the they say we are looking for attention from Brothers yet this is how we are like you say today about talking taking some of your father's characters why are women given so many rules so in other words she's saying for us we have taken our father's characters we talk a lot and now you you are here telling us we are we are what we are dating or we are seeking for attention now um this question is um brother are you the one who was telling sisters they seeking for attention you about to faint okay so um sisters are misunderstood now I want to agree with this sister but also I want to disagree with her number one I want to agree with this sister that not every younger man yes sister I'm going to take up for you now Brothers not every sister that smiles to you talks nicely means that they are seeking for attention by the way these days these brothers are also becoming something a sister smiles and then he goes to all the other brothers do you know the other sister so and so has interest in me who told you because the sister smiled she think you think that they have interest in you come on be respectful I I I shouldn't think so a sister can smile I also believe I always teach my daughters to be kind and loving and you know greet people with respect and you know it doesn't mean because you don't want to show interest someone good to say I'm fine I'm fine you're just running away because you don't want someone to to think that you you are showing yourself to and then you you greet people when you are running away no I don't think I don't believe that I believe that a woman should be confident but also with shamefacedness these days sisters open their eyes wide sincerely even if it was me and you open your eyes white to me I would think this sister has a problem the Bible talks about shamefacedness with and sobriety it is in the Bible you see brother brother and the sister is greeting you these days God bless you this is how Brothers do and sisters are like that brothers are looking down it is sincere it is the other way around there is something wrong going on by the way in the spiritual real there is a shift I don't know if you have observed it sisters are more sober and brothers are more shy yet it is sisters supposed to be shy and brothers sober there is a problem here brothers are losing their sobriety so so that's why you know the sisters are becoming like that but also there is this aspect of equality and U you know we can do what men can do and things like that and this has also spoiled our our women in our generation but I believe believe a sister a sister a believer of the message she should know her place okay as much as you are being talkative and friendly to a brother don't overstep your bounds or your boundary H you should do uh for example there is um uh a brother who came and was talk Talking being talkative to my daughter one of my daughters not the small ones the big ones so and um this brother was talking over talking uh and this sister realized there is a problem here there is a problem here this sister was spiritual but some of you sisters even when you realize there's a problem you're like no no problem we just being friends God has already spoken to you by instinct or by discernment and you are refusing to believe because you have a wrong Spirit on you and is called the spirit of last simple but if you are of God if you have the spirit of God and you're talking to a brother you can know that the brother has crossed the line or you can know the sister has crossed the line and then there you just withdraw you withdraw yourself you don't even need to tell them a brother you're crossing the line no just withdraw yourself and keep yourself and then I've preached here on the pull pit many times that uh Brothers don't give uh don't ask for sisters contacts and I mean it by the way and I've stood by that and I'll preach that until God reveals to me something else whether you do it or not that's up to you me I'll keep preaching it why and someone the other day asked me he said now there are some sisters who are group team leaders sister gud sister f sister kugon and others you know fib and others now they were saying what about the sisters who are team leaders are they not allowed to contact brothers please it's not the rules these rules it is not these rules you have to understand what I was saying read between the lines don't take the words otherwise you will shoot yourself in the foot I'm not saying that it is a taboo for a brother to contact a sister sister to contact her brother you've already heard it brother and sister if indeed you're brother and what is wrong with it is it demonic is it Satanic but where a brother or a sister whichever is contact you every morning and every evening how are you my sister how was the night how are you my sister how is the morning how are you how are you how are you how are you becomes how are you you realize there is a problem here there is something going on is a problem with this brother and then when you said the brother says no me I was just being very friendly to the brother or to the sister no you are lying you know there is something going on here even if me I'm a pastor now you are my daughters if I begin contacting you you that have phones oh sister I don't know sisters which are here oh sister how are you today morning oh that morning you tell me I'm fine Pastor God bless you and then when I do it tomorrow you say when I do the thir you when I do it the fourth time you even show your friend by the way Pastor has been contacting me every morning at the same time what is wrong you get the point because you know I'm married but these younger men you don't care because you know maybe they're interested in me say you behave as if you don't know but you know you see you know you know there is something going on and then at the end of the day they break your heart you say but me I was not aware you were aware from the beginning and he didn't come to inform the pastor you say so it's not rules it is to just know the boundary and not pass the boundary because if you pass the boundary you will end up in trouble and if you end up in trouble you'll be blaming the brother you'll be blaming the sister you be blaming me when people pass the boundaries on their own and then they break each other's heart I usually don't don't feel so sorry for them because they we Tau them if I had not taught them I I I will feel sorry but if they are well taught like people you are well taught I don't expect any of you daughters here to come here and say someone broke your heart how come how come they even accessed your heart mhm tell us how did they access it someone wants to break your heart for someone to break your heart they must find it and then they will break it so you are the one who made it too easy for them to break it keep yourself protect yourself guard your heart all right is that amen so I I I I also think that that there should be a balance to that it's not always that whoever contacts whoever it is a a bad thing okay just don't cross cross that the line God bless you Pastor is this war going on in Israel with Palestine just for a Biblical right and is it okay for me to be on the side of Palestine because all of the Palestines are not terrorists Hallelujah now whoever wrote this thing needs to be taught okay it's all don't laugh whoever wrote this they need to be taught okay and I don't have time to do the teaching here please come see me but I'm going to make a few comments now actually incidentally this question is coming at the right time there's a pastor who made me said I've seen you do these interviews I have he has a burden to do an interview he would like me to do an interview with him on the war of Israel and Palestine I hope I will be able to do itth if the Lord moves on my heart for that and see CU I can see there is a need for that I will even contact him today and I tell I'll tell him you see there is a need for it and we'll see how God will guide us on it um the the war between Palestine and Israel yes it is biblical okay okay anything that goes around Israel is biblical right from the first world war to the second world war to the third world war all the world wars are involving or they are going or surrounding Israel it's all about Israel it has always been about Israel and Christians are always supposed to stand with Israel because Israel is a nation of God regard regardless of whether they are believers or not okay they are the nation of God God blesses those who bless uh because the promise of God does not grow old or Decay or rot he says I'll bless them that bless you I'll Cur them that Cur you now we do not support the the killing of children and the killing on either side it's a brutal thing because not all are terrorists we understand but when it comes to Nations cuz you see let me let me show you something here Palestine is saying even when you see all those people in in Europe uh they have these placards and going around do you know what they chanting they saying from the river to the sea from The River To The Sea it is for Palestine do you know what they meaning the river they're talking about is at the end of Israel and the sea is at the end of Israel so they are saying Israel must be wiped out okay that's what they're saying that Israel has no right to exist Palestine in their chter actually they say Palestine has no right to exist as a nation I mean Israel has no right to exist as a nation in the mid in the Middle East for them they are saying it is the Europeans that brought them there and therefore they saying they should be wiped out they should be killed that's why recently they attacked and were killing they killed more than a thousand people just killing killing killing burning children you find a mother and a father you know a mother catching the child and and and the father catching the mother and the child and you know and then you find they have burnt them these Palestinians they came and burnt them and and then you find that they they rap the women and then after that they kill them they find I mean like things you don't even want to think of why because they for them their number one rule their number one idea is destroy Israel doesn't matter how you do it but destroy it so they believe that's why if you go back to the history I wish I had the time man this is this uh thing is interesting if if you go back to the history you realize that at one time Israel fought a war against all the Arab states all of them they combined together to fight against Israel but still Israel won Israel has fought Wars when they were even on their own when no one was fighting for them but they still won because God has always been on their side and then the other thing which I should also tell you is that uh you find that most of these terrorists are really hiding in Islam um but um they uh orig they are true origin by the way both Palestinians and um the Israelites are all descendants of Abraham how many knew that they all came from Abraham okay and it all started with Hagar who gave birth to Ishmael and Sarah who gave birth to Abraham and Abraham was a son of the promise and God promised them that land where they currently are and then the others the Palestinians they they came out from the Arabs like could say even they came out from uh from from hagga and Ishmael so you see and we uh the Believers of the Bible actually believe in the god of Israel so how can you believe in the god of the Israelites and you do not support Israel you would be a liar support Israel because there is a blessing for supporting Israel there is no blessing for supporting Palestine though because God told ishma your your son will live but he will live by the sword and that's why it is only those Nations that butcher people by cutting their necks off because it is in the Bible God spoke about it um so it's not about Nations it's about the word of God I would say so whoever ask this question if you want more details in history in the Bible and all that you can meet me and we go through the details okay I'm about to finish I have about three questions only my question is that is it okay to sing some songs that are entertainment gospel I mean that in some cases these new songs are gospel there is CH for you for yes is it aak what does she mean religious song ah s this is a new language you people you have this LS uh mhm I'm currently in a high school where it is compulsory for us to wear trousers because our casual wears are knee length we have to put trousers and Saturday is trousers and it is compulsory I have done punishments and next thing is an expansion expulsion what should I do uh simple uh the Bible did not say we should not wear that which pertaineth unto a man only with an exception if you are in school so whoever ask this this question there is no exception to the word of God he did not say if you're in school it's all right it's understandable no if you want me to say that I won't say it okay I will only tell you stand with the word and God will stand with you where necessary you can even change the school or you can begin by the parents talking to the administration sometimes you have even they have even involved us as pastors we come talk to the admin if they refuse then the only option is to change schools I had one of my daughters she was at this school and they were refusing her to keep her hair we have to change her take her to another school you see so the word of God we don't take it lightly we take it seriously uh and uh regarding these songs um you yourself you asking because you have a question about those songs to begin with and uh you know you see you hear the word CH I don't even know this song who knows this song CH for years How does it go you see you're even ashamed to sing it in church because I believe it has a wrong Spirit behind it I don't know the song for sure but um I know those like that song I was mimicking here they played it so much what is it what does it say sing sing [Music] it for Jesus okay now I will say this usually it's not about the lyrics that when you talk about by the way listen listen carefully when we talk about other people going to do weddings here you need to know which music is acceptable as a matter of fact I'm even intending that we shall have our own Brothers working on that music because you're going to have spirits come in our children pick pick them and they begin you know and those P when someone picks it they have it for life now you are hearing little children beginning Che you see they already picking those Spirits now listen with songs it is three things number one the lyrics okay what makes a song a gospel song number one the lyrics what do I mean by lyrics some people don't understand do you know what I mean by lyrics the other brother is looking down yet I was asking him which means he did not understand so lyrics means words the words of the song okay what does it say that is the first thing that makes it gospel but it's not the only thing the other thing is the the beat the beat there are Beats you can hear even on some for example like yesterday I was with my boy Ed where is Ed he was SE here comfortably as if he was hearing and he asked me is he I wanted you to see him he's very small but he asked me uh you know when they put on the song He was going to begin singing I saw him was going to begin and then he stopped asked daddy is that a good song and and and the sisters the sister also told the DJ to remove it so I had the MC telling the DJ ah that one they have refused to remove it what was it Jerusalem okay you have heard that song and many of you think it is a gospel song it is not it is not did you know that it is not it is a a secular song you go and make your research okay because you're here in Jerusalem it doesn't mean it is what a gospel song It's a secular song even the Believers refus it the spirit in the boy of three years had already refused it and he was like this already had started and I told him me I had not even realized the song so I was presuming that every song they playing is a good song so I told him it is good so he doed again but he said dadd are you sure it is a good song I said wait when I heard it said no it is not a good song my boy it is not so what am I saying that uh the other thing is the is the the tune of the song The Spirit of the song the people who sang the song also It Matters by the way even if they are not Believers of the message what Spirit were they in you understand now because like a du or because um who do we have here Chon because cedon now sings a gospel song We Don't so- called gospel it doesn't become gospel and we sing it in church you understand who is he he's not even born again you understand so someone who is not born again I wouldn't think that you know God would take them God would bring my food through them we have better sources so I would say we sing songs of Judith here she's not a believer of the message but you can see sincerely that she was being moved by the spirit and she was at the time also still in the spirit when she came out of the spirit don't you see the song she's singing have you not seen them they are completely secular you know and you can't even sing them even if they are so- called gospel they secular we can't sing them at all so you can see that some of those songs are not uh spiritual songs for conception of Believers I hope I don't find you on your own party in your own home on your own whatever playing some of those songs and then you are dancing CU you're saying it is religious songs we should do there we have real good dancing songs for believers do you know that real good dancing songs you don't even have to sing hymns you have many songs you see and whoever whatever anybody sings or writes as long as it is spiritual it is from my God the words are perfectly agreeing with the word some even some religious songs are not ours by the way you hear the words they're not connecting you leave that one as long as the words are right the spirit behind it is right the person singing it is in the spirit then that one is my song so songs are very very cautious we have to really be cautious about those things all right uh God bless you I have been having vision of a clock that shows me some minutes before midnight and some minutes after midnight kindly advise me on the vision I do not know how to advise you on that Vision but what I can say is H because you see now when you say Vision I also don't know the details was it a vision or it was a dream number one number two when the things why is very sensitive is When someone tells you what they have been seeing and they leave out some details you cannot know the entire meaning of the whole thing so uh it's difficult to interpret them but if I take this in the scripture I can only tell you that the the Bible talks about the cry that went out in the middle of the night you remember that that that is in the Book of Matthew it is talking about uh the coming of the bridegroom in the middle of the night that was midnight actually so what was it it was the coming of the bridegroom so I would say perhaps this this question is connected to Israel showing that our time as Gentiles is really coming to an end and the Rapture is very soon okay so is it okay for a Believer to use hble medicines for showering nothing wrong with it as far as I know nothing wrong with it as far as I know but if that those H medicines are coming from aist that is putting huh it may not even be a problem that is a hble right yeah it's not um it's not about the Hub you take cuz I mean these hubs are all created for us it is ours whether you are drinking it or showering it there's no problem but what I'm saying is you know those things they add on it is it Traditions you know when you are showering you know say those words speak these words and look in one side don't look on the other side and also do like that make sure you do it at this time of the hour tie this on your mouth that one is the Believers don't use it's like a m how many know a M I don't know how to also say it in English these are traditional things Believers don't use a MBA by the way if you have been using a MBA or planning to use one may God deliver you in Jesus name a mum is not for believers because those things if you want soil you can it means that your body lacks vitamins and that's why you just go to the pharmacy take some multivitamins or take some um how do they call that uh there are some good things especially for mothers who are pregnant you know you take that and uh you're fine you're fine uh but uh those kind of things they take them in the shrines and then they begin making it with witchcraft adding witchcraft by the way there's a difference between HS that are not witchcraft and HS that are connected with witchcraft there's a difference and I believe that using hubs or Hub medicine or hubs that are not connected to Witchcraft there is no problem with it as a matter of fact all medicine is HS doctor are you there is it correct yes all medicines is HS so it is not a sin to use HS for uh because the Bible says they were created for food in the Book of Genesis and if you want to shower itat different there is one they drink there is one they can just put there they boil in water and then you cover yourself and uh how do they call it huh you steam yeah you steam yourself you begin steaming there and then all fever goes now you find a Believer saying that is a sin a sin according to what I wouldn't think that is a problem but if you add your witchcraft there some words then it becomes a problem there is one likea for for malaria we had all that medicine before advancement in science I believe also Adam was using it like that animals use it did you know that animals when an animal has a problem it knows which which H to eat so it can get well you know because they in the wild no one treats them these ones which are in the zoos they give them our medicine which is a you know from science but those ones in the wild they know how to treat each other so it is not bad in my own way of looking at it to use hubs to drink for medicine for showering for whatever as long as it is not connected too yes please give them the microphone then there are these people who show our HS like to get blessings M that blessings come seeking for yes that blessings come looking for that is witchcraft to begin with okay that's what I said if it's connected to Witchcraft you don't do it okay I did not know know that you shower a h and someone just comes running literally running after you Believers don't use such kind of things there are some who sell tea leaves and they said that it heals like 20 sicknesses well if you have the sicknesses and you want to take the te leaves what's wrong with it but H to me I would think that that is a a sales language but most of the hubs are medicine most hubs by the way are medicine and others are poison so you know some people they are born with a natural ability of knowing which Hub is what medicine some people know those things uh but um I think where you begin to take the hubs and twist it it's just like a Jaga how many know Jaga how is it called in English CU huh Cannabis weed huh sorry marijana yeah marijana Marana marijana Marana now that thing do you know that most medication comes from that a lot of pain medication has ner in it okay in doses so um most most of the HS are created for medication but you see it is this people who abuse it now when you take a Jag and You Begin smoking it sincerely you are you are a smoker okay you cannot tell us I'm I'm I'm smoking a h I'm fine no you are a smoker and that thing is going to hit your head and brains and it will change your orientation you will think in the in the wrong way and when you think in the wrong way you will do wrong things and when you do wrong things it will make you drunk and when you are drunk you will not be your own self it's just like someone who uses that Hub to say let people follow me you are just trying to be a and uh Believers should not Believers just should drink Christ Jesus and people will just follow you you'll get favor it's favor you can get favor if you drink Christ yes give the sister Diana God bless you yes ask the question about the the the vision but maybe I'll come to you because it just comes without any word it just tell me the time and then I also wanted to ask a question since it is in line um I we know that I I been listening to someone with a prophet and he says uh God doesn't deal with time because he's internal but uh in the dreams I'm given particular months and days but then they because me I know there's a part in Genesis where they said that uh that they I think the say that you will have the child according to the time of men and also there's those scriptures that say that seasons and times I think are for us but for me when I come I don't know whether they yeah continue okay so I I cannot be knowing whether it is according to the time of men or it is that spiritual time so I find that by the time when I see it maybe it's a dream and there's an instruction or something when I count according to this time of of men it's overlaps and I don't get it so I don't uh okay so I think we will uh we can take that up in person to find out because I would need to ask you a few more questions on that vision to know exactly if it fits in with SC the prophecy of scripture uh uh or not and what it could imply but I that it is connected to Israel and um the spiritual timeline of the of the Gentiles this is what we were just speaking about here during the the service last Sunday okay is it okay for a Believer okay now this person I would like to know who wrote this because she says or he says why does Rachel hate me now I do not know who said this is a personal issue and I'd like to know who wrote this uh you could tell us now or come to me later are you the one who wrote it why would you write something like this huh you were talking about it and then you wrote it no but you do not support football I mean um just to own a a football club and support you cannot own a football club because you don't own it you can't own it you lying yourself it is owned by whoever owns it and whoever gets the money those people make money out of this thing it's not just a game they make money and billions of money by the way out of it um but to us our source of entertainment is not football let me tell you this as Believers our source of entertainment is not football when you begin to see yourself going into that direction you just like movies you like football you know you like to go in what is this you know these days they watch football in bars you go in a bar you begin watching football the next thing you're going to be doing is what betting not so those those things come together it comes as a package love for football love for watching it betting and then poverty it is all entertain together and then back sliding before you know it you're drinking beer so and of course it also comes with groups and clubs and friendships and connections you meet someone you say oh this one is my brother we all of money you when you come to the word you are as cold as ice when you come to the church you are as cold as ice but when you are out there with watching football you are as hot as a a what as a call eh so there is a problem when you find a Believers and by the way this thing spirit is taking over some Believers we should shine those things because is we are not a part of it in the church edge book somewhere our Prophet says that U they are happy when they have their ball games but they they don't want us to be happy because of Revelation but for us we are excited by Revelation it excites us but when they see us excited they don't like us and they call us hola they call us bad words OD Ball but for them when they happy with their ball games so are you among them are you among them who are happy with their ball games me I am not I am among those who are happy because of Revelation I am starred up when I am hearing the word of God when I'm studying the word or when I begin to worship sometimes when I'm driving in the car and I'm worshiping or putting worship music oh begin shouting and rejoicing sometimes if you ever see us driving by you never that's why even I don't hear or see anyone on the road because we are always drunk when we are driving we we drink when we are singing and shouting and rejoicing and wo like like that you know the other day my wife said ah maybe those people are hearing what is inside here they are looking at us I said maybe but I don't want to know because I was drunk you know Believers are drunk by the by the word of God right by by by the songs of Zion these are the things which should excite us if something else excites you there's a problem with your experience for sure explain The Saga of Prophecy now I will not read this because this is not a saga number one now she says that uh I don't even know where you got this from young lady say that brother bam had prophesied that Billy Paul would go would be that that the Rapture would happen before Billy Paul brother bam did not prophesy that the Rapture would happen before B Paul dies that did not happen I don't know where you got it from probably among those people who fight against the message but brother bam never did prophesy that that this thing he never did prophesy it number one number two it is um the comments which were given about Billy Paul was Billy Paul telling his experiences with his father and that has nothing to do with the message or with us uh and unless you have another question on that I don't feel it should take our time there's someone having a head there a hand rather I had a question on the past past view uh which was about sports uh like in on our places at schools even at home like you know we have Leisure Time like you go and run run around to make the body flexible not to grow very fast um even like at school they can bring Sports time and you go maybe for football is it okay now uh food um games are not bad and neither are they a sinen if they done for the right purpose um running for for one is a very good physical exercise so I believe in being physically fit it's all right walking running but again you're not going to walk with only your pajamas because you are what you you like these people they go almost half naked so some of those things as brothers we don't even do them because of the spirit around them now like you go to play football everybody's having a short mij now you are also going there like that so that's why we don't what but I would imagine if I would call brother M and yourself and Brother Martin and a few other brothers here who are very good at football with say let us buy our ball we go there we do some physical exercises and we begin playing it what is wrong with it I would not think that it is it's a problem but where we are talking about commercial football um whereby it's for entertainment purposes for betting uh that I believe is wrong I believe is wrong uh you find yourself as a brother going to uh the football pitch uh uh with a gang of of people who are not even Christians at all what Spirit are you getting from there it's not the spirit of Christ certainly so it will be another kind of spirit so that those are the kind of things you would need to watch but football in itself or netball or volleyball in itself I wouldn't think it is a sin because if we had a school and we we would have those kind of uh uh activities I wouldn't think it is uh it is a sin uh so I think that's how I look at that I know there are some believers who when they hear anything football they think that is a sin out right you're going to hell but not that way not that way you need to have to strike a balance and to know what is wrong and what is not wrong because now I even see a question here is it bad to play phone games like matatu football Etc you see it goes back to what I was teaching here today if the moment you receive the Holy Spirit you won't be woring worried about the rules what can I do what can I not do what does the church accept what it's not about the church it's not about the preachers it's not about anything it's about the will of God in your life and when the Holy Spirit is in you he gives you a new appetite now I would wonder if the holy spirit is in me what would he make me do would he make me go to play games or like football on my phone would the Holy Spirit inspire me to play mat sincerely and is the holy spirit inspiring me ah Pastor come on are you saying that we should always be in the speed 24/7 someone asked me that question one time are you saying we should never have any games at all are you used to play matter by I don't even remember how they play it matter to is cards I don't remember how they play cards I would ask how many he remember oh no anyway you wouldn't even raise up your hands because you think they would think you are not spiritual but I remember I used to play cards I used to play dulu and a few other those things now what is wrong with d how many even know D here a few people here no D no that's not that is rud my dear that's rudo D is something else you just do like that on whatever some people don't even know it yeah I see sister Diana knows it very well so so dulu and other things we used to playay but you see the moment I received the Holy Spirit the desire just died if you ask me is it wrong I don't even know what to tell you I just tell you I don't have the desire for those things and if you can receive what I received you are desire for those things will die permanently that's what I will tell you you see so it has nothing to do with rules of dos and don'ts you see it is about the spirit of God coming in your life but the problem is when many people get an experience with God they want to uh Force other people who have not got that experience to act uh on what they do also as as a rule okay that is where it gets messy uh but I believe that you being now younger people you are here if I'm teaching you I'll tell you outrightly those Spirits are those things rather are not inspired by the spirit of God it is basically entertainment okay some entertainment is outrightly wrong and believer should not be engaged in it for example betting going out to watch football going in the vi vi do they do you still have B to watch movies these days they even have improved B they call it what theaters Cinema HH you find a Believer going there you are not a Believer you just joking no no no no no going there to watch oh why are you quiet do you do those things you would be cheering me saying amen say it preach it you're very quiet no believers wouldn't do such things you see H where you find them they're going out you know to to play football here watch football here go here in the world mix up with the World by the way me I even believe and this is how I raise my children I don't believe in mixing my children who are believers with the neighbor children who are not Believers I don't believe that you know mix them up go play together I don't do that and I believe it if it it applies to the younger ones it also applies to you the older ones they come with their own wrong Spirits they watch wrong stuff they they hear wrong words they they raised by parents who don't even know God and you who is raised under the word you go and mix up that's what happened to Ahab when he mixed up he ended up Maring somebody wrong or picking feelings for a wrong person same thing that happened to Samson you see those mixing and brother brother says God doesn't like mixers God likees separators so that's what I really stand for I believe we should be different in everything and you your phone if you cannot surely uh uh the other thing I would tell you about these phone games is it is very addictive I've seen people who play these games they even begin to detate in their way of thinking I don't know if you you understand what I mean someone is always thinking about the game even when they in church they are not in church their hand is playing you think they're sharing the word but when they seeing now they passing the game as and then he remembers he's in church he keeps quiet you see let me tell you this thing is so addictive I I'll tell you why I say that God by the way I thank God he took me almost through all these things so I can be able to tell you one day I was in Ethiopia and I wanted to uh we were always lining up for a very long time we get tired usually when we go to immigration to renew our residence IDs and permits so you would stand until you get one day I was there on the Queue and I saw another man cuz for us we would stand you do like this you do like that you squat you stand ah but one day I saw a man having a smartphone he was playing a game you know these bubbles these things you point and then you you fire at and then they fall down how many know know that kind of game yeah so I saw it so I didn't want to ask him what game is that because I did not even know at that time I mean I'd not been accustomed to playing those things I I wouldn't think I wanted to introduce myself to that man on that basis CU I was a minister of the Gospel so I just I just looked at him to see what kind of game is it and then how they call it when he was closing I saw the name okay I'll download it so now when I got the CH I began downloading it immediately and so fast to download by the way don't you don't even pay anything I have it I also started ah I enjoyed it I'm telling you even I did not even realize when the woman was saying yeah next please sorry sorry I didn't even realize that that I was the next one for a longer time until the person behind me had they had to all like shout hey please he I took my phone I put it in the pocket ah but I enjoyed that day because I did not feel the tness I was very happy so I said this thing will always be playing it in my free time so I continued playing it in my what in my free time when for example I am tired at home and um I am free then I pull it out I play when I'm on Long cues I'm standing waiting that was no longer a problem I was I had started myself I would just remove it and play now it reached a point whereby this thing went and embedded in my brains I'm I'm confessing these things publicly because it's the truth it reach a time when it was really on my brains I could literally dream it you see I could see myself playing it each time when I'm doing even other important matters you see sometimes this is very funny friends even you would be in church singing and then that game comes in your head I'm telling you yes when that thing happened one day to me by the way it's aad game why don't you play you know came as a voice why don't you play in church I said what I went back home I confessed to my wife I told her I feel that the devil is attack said this game I said because she was also tired of it she was always coming talk to me when I am wait wait you see so it was killing my family it was killing my marriage it was now beginning to kill the ministry H immediately I repented I told I confessed everything she prayed with me thank God my wife has been my pastor by the way so she prayed with me and then I deleted the game from that time I've been free I've been free so to some of you who have who are bound by these games you can also be set free in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ it is a spirit which is Cap capturing you don't say anything else you are captured by a wrong spirit and you should be delivered I can only tell you my experience I can't tell you anything else I don't know all right you raising up your hand is it about the same thing okay there's a sister here right go ahead say it God bless you s uh me this question I think it was like a meeting like this when I was in Nairobi it was the youth meeting then they told us to write the questions then after I wrote so it was about church order in a young youth young people we then I asked Pastor that is it good for a brother and a sister to walk together in okay I brought it like in different sex to walk when he's a brother and a sister then the pastor me that as long as where they are going and where they're coming from so I was like H so it means I can walk with brother n when I'm from church like we are staying like in Chala I can walk with brother n and Chala cuz we coming from church cuz he brought it up like that as long as where you are going I'm where you're coming from so I was confused about that question so I need answer you you saying something on that thing after her favor I saw you raising up your hand okay so is it you are not con convinced I'm still perplexed about that why you didn't like the answer uh thing for you and the pastor looks at it that way we all have our own own opinions but must agree with the word so I would think I agree with the pastor walking with someone is it a sin it's not even for example going in a a car with someone uh you in public transport are you going to be seated only next to men are you have even learned that even in churches you find you can MI up what's wrong with it you see it's a good thing to me I don't find it as a problem I would not find it as a problem at all uh if someone listen the Bible says to the pure all things are pure if you are pure in your heart and you are going home and you find a sister on the road she's also going home you're simply going to walk talk what are you going to talk about the word of God and maybe other things in life or education or whatever it's your intention you don't have a negative intention say it's a thing what about so to me I would think that even if someone wanted to see they would not see in the open it goes to the motive that someone has if someone has a wrong motive they would always end up wrongly in what they do actually you will even restrict them from walking together talking together meeting together sitting together in church but they will find each other together somewhere you get so it's about the motive that they have restrictions in some scenarios they are good but H when they are overboard they they are not scripturally founded unless you have a scripture that thou shalt not walk with a brother alone on the road then I will agree with you but where I have no scripture to bind me on that I think I would agree with that Pastor that it depends on where you are coming from and where you are going yes um but generally speaking we we we we would we we advise against younger people even even if they're adults by the way find finding a woman and a man unmarried together alone in a private space and that private space is not only physical it can also be on phone you see I think that is wrong you find a man who is always married is the one writing younger ladies oh how are you my sweetheart oh my dear oh because he's older you think there is no problem and you as a a younger girl you are also very busy oh I'm fine and these days you call them daddy oh I'm fine Daddy ah you have no speed which is telling you this is wrong you're not answering are you doing these things it is wrong you understand so even physically me you can never find me in the in a private space with a sister being alone even I have these daughters at home my home my own home children that I can say they are my children you know girls you can't find me m they are they alone together in a room I don't do those things you see why is it mean does it mean something wrong is going to happen no it's just right way to behave so keep yourself guard yourself guard your heart not the right way so go I thought it was a very good thing to bring up it has helped me to bring up out these things but um so to me it's all about the private space keep that private space clear okay but if it's a public space and you're walking or going some other place or or you know I wouldn't think it's a problem at all okay it's a public space and you're walking or going some other place or or you know I wouldn't think it's a problem at all okay um and but again it goes back to your intention uh that's what God looks at why do women love money that's a question uh I will answer the question because in Genesis uh after the fall God told the man that the the woman that your desire shall be upon him okay so a man is meant to provide for the woman and a woman is meant to receive from the man so it's not a scene that women love money I have a lot of women in my home so I know that's why I'm protecting them so Brothers younger men work if you don't have money don't worry you will not keep that marriage I'm telling you brother Iranians work get money and build yourself a what a home if you don't have money she will stay there but she will not be happy H so don't think it is a sin you you wanted me to say it is a sin and I rebuke them I will not rebuke them you see it is natural thing for them to be provided and cared for and you as a man you have to work and feed them and provide for them and nourish them and then the other thing you sisters don't receive money from people that are not your mats or your parents it is evil it is wrong it is satanic it will bring wrong Spirits in your life one way to enter a man's heart or rather a woman's heart is to give them a gift if you read in the Book of Esther you will find in the Book of Esther that the Bible says uh the king would give after he sees them he doesn't like them he sends them away but how does he keep them entertained with what with gifts they even forgot all about the king as long as they had the gifts so sister if you receive that gift you will never know what it will end up doing in your life you can end up in a situation you never expected to ever be in simply because you accepted money from a brother and you saying it is okay because women love money even Pastor the other time said it is all right it is not all right for you to receive money from a man who is not your father from a man who is not your husband from a man who is not intending to Mar you it will cause you trouble don't say I never told you all right why do most Brothers love women who don't overt talk it leaves them the ones who are free sad I think the one who is writing this thing a sister uh if you feel that Brothers love the ones who don't over talk you stop talking also why why are you talking why are you over talking you know some women are very good with gossip it's it's not we don't like it I'll tell you that the truth men don't like it but also women are meant to talk you can't stop them but some others over talk really sister don't worry if you over talk God will bring you someone who likes it there used to be a sister I don't know brother are we still live okay I will withhold some information but I'll tell you this in Ethiopia we used to have a sister who was having a lot of words and all of us were concerned about it and uh I mean like very difficult for uh any brother to get to a brother wrote me he said ah this one you have to T her she has to be tamed she's very good but she has to be tamed I mean like she was having a lot of words I've not seen any of you have words like those so but God gave her a very good brother who Ted her very well you see but he loved her for her words and they mingled together
