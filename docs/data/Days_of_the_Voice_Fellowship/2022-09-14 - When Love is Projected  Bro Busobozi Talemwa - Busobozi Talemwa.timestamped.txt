[33:53] amen
[33:55] [Music]
[33:57] amen why don't you turn with me to your
[33:59] Bibles
[34:00] [Music]
[34:03] I want to welcome everyone of you in the
[34:05] name of our Lord Jesus may God bless you
[34:09] amen
[34:12] so today I just want to speak on the
[34:15] subject of When Love is projected
[34:18] Sovereign Grace steps in
[34:21] and we will take first John chapter 4
[34:25] verses 16.
[34:32] first John is near the Book of
[34:34] Revelation
[34:42] you are there we say Amen
[34:46] so we are reading uh chapter 4 of 1st
[34:50] John
[34:51] verses 16 to 19.
[35:01] and we have known
[35:04] and believed the love that God has to us
[35:09] God is love
[35:11] and he has and he that dwelleth in love
[35:15] dwareth in God
[35:17] and God
[35:20] in him
[35:21] herein is our love made perfect that we
[35:26] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[35:29] because as he is
[35:32] so are we in this world
[35:36] there is no fear in love
[35:38] but perfect love casts out fear
[35:42] because fear has torment
[35:45] he that feareth is not made perfect in
[35:48] love
[35:49] we love him because he first loved us
[35:54] amen you may be seated
[35:57] I see everyone here tonight learn the
[36:01] English
[36:02] that a man
[36:04] so
[36:05] we will do without interpretation for
[36:07] tonight
[36:09] um I have this more subject on my heart
[36:11] share with you all and I pray that you
[36:13] give me your undivided attention and we
[36:16] as we see what the holy spirit will
[36:18] speak to us according to the desire of
[36:21] our heart you have something you need
[36:23] from the Lord tonight
[36:24] amen you just open your heart and see
[36:27] what the Lord will speak to you now
[36:30] those of you who have been in the
[36:32] message and have read uh the message
[36:36] when love is projected I I think you
[36:39] know where we are headed tonight it's a
[36:41] wonderful message it's one of those
[36:43] first messages I read years ago and the
[36:46] some brothers who printed it and on the
[36:49] on the cover of the message they put the
[36:52] 11th commandment I forgot to bring a
[36:54] copy for you
[36:55] uh the 11th commandment so I I was so
[36:58] curious I wanted to find out what is
[37:00] this 11th commandment because the Bible
[37:02] speaks of 10.
[37:03] then I found that you you brother Barnum
[37:06] was speaking of love
[37:08] and of course this is one of the Jesus
[37:10] he he told us to love one another so
[37:13] it's the Commandment from God to us to
[37:16] love one another amen
[37:19] and so uh in first John it says that we
[37:22] have known and believed the love that
[37:24] God has to us
[37:26] God is love and he that dwelleth in love
[37:30] dwelleth in God and God in him so now if
[37:32] you dwell in love you are in God and God
[37:35] is in you why because you dwell in love
[37:38] herein is our love made perfect that we
[37:41] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[37:45] so we do not have boldness
[37:48] to stand on the day of judgment
[37:51] if we are not in love but if we are in
[37:54] love and our love is made perfect then
[37:57] we have boldness in the day of judgment
[37:59] because as he is so are we in the war in
[38:02] this world there is no fear in love
[38:05] but perfect love that's what
[38:09] perfect love
[38:11] everybody
[38:12] cuts out fear
[38:15] because fear has torment he that feareth
[38:18] is not made perfect in love for we love
[38:21] him
[38:22] because he first loved us
[38:26] and in the message when love is
[38:27] projected uh just begin with this little
[38:30] line sentence that I I that really
[38:33] struck me in that whole message when the
[38:35] prophet said and when love has been
[38:38] projected
[38:39] then it's time for Sovereign Grace to
[38:43] step in
[38:45] it will do it every time are you
[38:48] following me when love has been
[38:51] projected when you manifest love is
[39:02] when you manifest love when you project
[39:04] love in your life then it is time for
[39:07] Sovereign Grace to step in and here he
[39:09] says it will do it every time
[39:13] so in other words there is no time that
[39:15] this is going to fail whenever you
[39:17] manifest love in your life through your
[39:19] life to someone Sovereign Grace must
[39:23] always step in
[39:25] Sovereign Grace is always around where
[39:28] love is
[39:29] Sovereign Grace always loves or likes
[39:32] the smell of Love whenever love is
[39:35] filled there is Grace and I should say
[39:38] where there is no love there is no Grace
[39:41] Hallelujah and now when we talk about
[39:44] love we can talk about several minutes
[39:47] different types of love
[39:50] there is what people call family love
[39:53] for the love you have for your family
[39:54] members for your mother for your father
[39:56] for your brothers and sisters but also
[39:59] there is two especially two types of
[40:01] love that brother talks about and one of
[40:04] them he calls it Agape or agape love
[40:08] that's the love of God and then Pharaoh
[40:10] love which is the love that you have for
[40:12] your wife or the love that you have for
[40:14] your friend
[40:15] now in this old uh these types of Love
[40:19] really most of them all of them are a
[40:23] perversion of the real love now there is
[40:26] only one real love are you following me
[40:28] there is only one real love and that is
[40:32] agape love all the other is really a
[40:35] perversion of agape love but really the
[40:38] pure perfect love that we know that the
[40:40] Bible is speaking over here in the book
[40:42] of First John is not Philo he's not
[40:45] family love
