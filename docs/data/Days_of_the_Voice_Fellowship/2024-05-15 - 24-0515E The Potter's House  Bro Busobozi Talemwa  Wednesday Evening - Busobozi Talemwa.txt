your blessings Lord upon each of us speak to us Lord in Jesus name we pray amen amen I'd like to greet you all in the precious name of our Lord Jesus excuse me today I'm also ministering to evening light and that means we shall go for an hour the Lord willing while you are still standing please turn to the Book of Jeremiah 18 vers 1 to 4 [Music] the word which which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise and go down to the Porter's house and there I will cause thee to hear my words then I went down to the Porter's house and behold he wrote a work on the vessels on on the wheels and the vessel that he made of clay uh that he made of clay was mad in the hand of the poter so he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the porter to make it then the word of the Lord came to me saying oh House of Israel canot cannot I do with you as this Porter sayith the Lord behold as the clay is in The Potter's hand so are ye in my hand oh House of Israel your name B for [Music] Isaiah 49:15 says can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of a womb yeah they may forget yet will I not forget thee behold I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me [Music] [Music] amen you may be seated may the Lord bless you so this evening I'm speaking on the Porter's house praise the name of the Lord amen I wanted to call you the Porter's hand or the Porter's house whichever you you want you see God dealt with Jeremiah in several ways and many of those were giving him signs he he he would give him a sign and then he would tell tell him this sign means this and this and this so when he wanted to tell him or to show him the condition of the House of Israel he took him he told him now Jeremiah I'd like you to arise and go down to the Porter's house and there I will cause you to hear my words God always wants to demonstrate things and the reason for that is because the way man works the way the brains of man works man works when he sees that is why the eyes are the doors to your heart what you see is very important a lot what you see DET Mees what you do because what you what you see goes directly to your heart and so he takes Jeremiah into the Porter's house and there he says I'll cause you to hear my [Music] words and he says then I went to the Porter's house and behold the porter wrote a work on the wheels you know I don't know if some of you have ever seen you know that that kind of e forget this is not God speaking they may forget yet will I not forget you behold I have Graven thee upon the palm of Palms of my hands thy walls are continually I believe it is as a pter now God here also takes another picture that he draws before our eyes and he draws a picture of a sucking mother and he says but can a sucking mother forget her child well of course some many of you may say no but you do not know that there are mothers who have forgotten their sucking children it has happened many times and so God says yes they may forget but he says but I have Graven thee upon the palm of my hands thy words are continually before me they may forget but I will not forget a mother can forget a child but I will not forget amen you know the pter Can Forget The Cay but our great Porter cannot forget his clay We Are The Clay in his hands he's the pter and we are the clay tell your neighbor I Am The Clay I Am The Clay and and um while I was reading this I thought cuz you see it just came to to me as a voice and I was like what does the Lord want me to talk about and so I took to study a little bit about it and found as I was taken as if to say as if Jeremiah as if I was Jeremiah and uh um you know I I was in my bedroom and um you know the revelation just struck me and I and I quickly called Edie I mean Ellie was everybody was outside they know whenever I'm studying I don't want any child to disturb so I shouted so highly amen hallelujah when the Revelation struck me it was a personal revelation this was for me and then Ed just quickly rushed in to see what was happening I don't see him here here and oh right there so and then I I I called him I said come here and I started preaching to him the inspiration I had received for our family out of this scripture I believe may God give you an inspiration for you for your family Hallelujah maybe I'll not be I not I'll tell you a little bit about what God revealed to us for my family the whole of last week I think before I think there's a sister who had received a a vision or I don't know what it was and she not I don't know why she didn't come to me but she went to Brother Martin told him Pastor is under attack and his and so she started praying for us and um and but she did not tell me but I had known I had also known about it that would be under attack and so but I do not know how and I had sent to a certain believer very far away and I told them we I am under attack and I need prayer I couldn't even tell tell them what kind of attack and and shortly after that and after the vision of the sister you know the Sunday that Pastor Gideon was here in the church uh you know he uh preached to us a very good you know sermon and but after the service my wife was very ill and uh you know she couldn't even go walk back home we had to drive her back home and after shortly after that then you know several of my children also you know took sick very terrible sickness and I was fine the whole time then on Friday is when I was attacked after very many years I remember when I was last sick that way if you ask me what I was sick from I do not know but I was terribly sick terribly sick and I did not want to scare my wife but I I was terribly see the way I felt and so um I knew I was under attack but I I I told the devil I am not going to accept this if the Lord has permitted it to come to me the Lord will take it away from me and um on on Sunday that is the second day of my being very sick I didn't even go to hospital although I encourage you to go to hospital I knew I was under attack and God showed it and everybody was praying I took I think my wife to hospital so don't say I don't believe in going to hospital and so I was afflicted and uh and I do not know why the whole time so when the Holy Spirit led me to this scripture I I got a big revelation and that's when I shouted here I saw myself go to this room as Jeremiah the Porter's house you know the Holy Spirit called it the porter said go to the Porter's house and Jeremiah walked he obeyed the voice of the Holy Spirit and he walked to the P's house and when he reached the Porter's house he saw the porter working on this vessel working on the wheels and the vessel that he made of clay was m in the hand of the pter it was mad but where in the hands of the porter it was spoiled but where in the hands of the porter brother sister let me tell you we are that vessel the Holy Spirit right there revealed to he said you are now that vessel and you are m in the hands of the pter but the pter after after the it was m in the hand of the porter the pter did not throw it away the made it again he made another vessel I believe it was a better vessel I believe it was a higher vessel be real now how many enjoy it how many don't enjoy it yet I wonder how many can put up their hands sister you put up to the middle how many don't enjoy it I don't know how many but why does that happen your heart's hanging on the weeping willow tree because your sins are separated you from the blessing he says I remember long ago when we used to come in here they would be playing down at the cross on a piano when the bail was being told there would hardly be a dry eye in the Church of course when they would when they would uh ring the bell many people would go to church they not time to go into church this is before the service would begin before the preacher would preach before the the song leer would sing there you would hardly find a dry eye in the CH everybody would be weeping slowly I just like that oldfashioned way that mellow that sweet the power of the Holy Spirit people broke up before we can ever make any Headway we have got to be broke up first that's why the Holy Spirit told me personally I'm breaking you to take you to another level and here I found he says before we can go to another level we have prophet of this generation and prophet of this generation and you still don't make it your yes now Lord hallelujah we need to talk more about that I feel this one hour will not be sufficient we will be able to talk about that again how God sometimes can break the human Spirit I'll show you many examples in the Bible That's why to some of you that keep hearing the and you you remain proud you you remain you remain unchanged you remain unwilling to to change to do what God wants you to do God has many ways and one of the ways he will tell you go to The Potter's House and when you reach in the Porter's house his intention is to break you into many pieces so that you can be able to humble yourself and hear his [Music] voice I want to follow me closely and now and how that just like the ground if you're going to have a crop a crop you have to break your ground up te eat all to pieces and then plant your seed and it will come depends on what kind of seed you plant then while it has broken up so then while the ground is all broken it is time to plant a seed can you imagine many people have thought that they have seed well we have the message of Y oh we we have we have the Seven Seals we have Church ages oh we have this we have that yes they have all that but did you know you can have all the books and still don't make it to and you remain in the tribulation did you know how many knew that by way did you know that you did not some of you did not you can actually not only have them you can even study them listen to all the TS read all the messages you can read the whole Bible from cover to cover and still you may remain in the Rapture how come it is the ground in which you have put that word what what what pleases God what pleases God is a contrary Spirit whates God is is a broken heart not someone who is very hard not someone who is very proud whenever God sees something like that he just moves away but he will look upon a man who has a broken heart who has a contrite spirit someone who is teachable when amen when the seed of the word comes to such a heart what it does is it just begins to germinate then this Brethren who was going away from the promised land down into Babylon they were carried away because their sins had separated them from God and I'm just oldfashioned enough to believe tonight that when the church or any organization begins to play and flat with the world you are going to have the same experience getting away from God getting away from the truth I know it's the truth that's why we don't believe in playing and flatting with the world are you hearing me young people even older ones are like I believe Christians are not supposed to play and flat with the world if you believe that say a big amen Christians must never flat with the world we must never play with the world because when if we do that then we shall get away from God one brother one of our brothers did it brother Samson he began to Flat with the world I want you to imagine a woman would come to him and and and you know this and and the whole time like you if you're a Catholic a Believer is a Catholic Hallelujah if you believe in the Trinity your fellow believer is a traran if you believe in drinking alcohol your fellow believer is the one who drinks but as far as I'm concerned I don't believe in drinking I believe the one who believes like me I don't believe in adultery I is the one who believes like I I don't believe in child baptisms I believe is the one who believes like me I don't believe in makeup I believe is the one who believes like me I don't believe in women wearing trousers I believe the one who believes like me I don't believe in wearing almost half naked and you are putting on the high heels and going around meing around I don't believe that I believe the Bible teaches against that and fellow believer believes like me and you ask me who is a Believer it show that spiritual Amnesia somewhere we find that that's the same thing Samson suffered Sams had spiritual Amnesia let me tell you we have to separate and nonbelievers there is a very strong line praise the name of the Lord yes of course we want to love the whole world just like Jesus loved the whole world and he died for the whole world we will also love the whole world and die for the whole world by giving to them the the Jesus that died and resurrected but not by flatting with not by going to the Beer joints with them not going going to this kind of place filthy places with them not by playing cards with them not by you know Jing with them throwing dat jokes with them not by enjoying worldly music with them do I have a Believer here today by the way we will not do that we are Christians and we principles we stand for let me tell you as long as God is alive in heaven amen sin shall remain here but righteousness shall also remain because the word will remain preachers may choose to scale down on the word preachers may choose to reduce the power of the word by compromising on the word but I have news for you this evening God will have preachers that will never compromise on the word but will preach it the way it is the reason why they are compromising is because they compromised themselves but let me tell you brother sister we still have preachers and people who are fighting against sin who are fighting against unbelief and they are not willing to sett up for Less the only will to stand for what the word of God says we may not be the best but I believe we are one of them are you one of them tonight praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah well if you're saying a weak amen it means you're already compromised hallelujah amen praise God hallelujah yeah you say well brother amen I'm fighting and I'm overcoming and I will say Amen I'm going to be on the side of the right I'm going to be on the side of the oldfashioned Believers but what is the problem that we have today that Believers have refused to go to the P's house where are they they in the palace where are they they in the marketplace but they have refused to go to the P's house but God himself would come and tell a prophet go to the Porter's house so I will cause you to hear my voice and let me tell you we have come in the Porter's house tonight what do we see in the pter house you have to be broken up I've been in a Ministry now 20 years he says myself 17 years now and I've seen all different sorts and kinds of around the world but I tell you friends you may be looked down upon but I like an oldfashioned broke up meeting some of you people may not understand what I'm talking but what I'm talking about is singing and You Begin crying praying and You Begin soing hearing the word and You Begin crying that's what I'm talking about have you ever seen it in your life if you have never seen it in your life you have never been to The Potter's House you have never been and you need to I am not judging you tonight but I'm telling you you need to go into the Porter's house we have a lot of believers who know a lot of the message but they have never been to the P's house they don't know what Brokenness means they don't know what crying means they think it is just emotion that's why they talk against it but let me tell you it is more than emotion I know what it is because I've experienced it before and when you experience it you can never be the same again when you experience it something takes place on the inside of you Hallelujah someone come by one day and he said what I was preaching here and I'm quoting here William Bram 1960 1953 rather some of you who don't know what I'm reading I can I can read these things because this is a man that God Vindicated in our generation and that's why we quote his how many believe his messages I I I I confess I'm not a very good quarter but when I do I really do so listen hallelujah huj praise the name of the Lord someone come by and one day and he said while I was preaching here he said Billy how could you preach and that woman sitting back there sing crying [Applause] saying I said maybe that was a whole lot of the reason why I was preaching that that thing made me preach and he said well what would just almost kill me that would just almost kill me if I was trying to talk if I was trying to talk and somebody carting on like that that would almost kill me I said it didn't hurt me brother it was encouraging me he said was she a horrible sin or something why was that woman was she a horrible sinner and we see we have the same churches today I'm imagining in in the denomination chur where I was a preacher come preach I'm imagining if a person would would stand up and say Amen everybody would be sh is that and this is what this person thank God delivered us from such churches we are here where there is life we are here where there is the word we are here where we are preaching about righteousness H going to heaven of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah is she a horrible sin or something I said no she was a Christian filled with the Holy Spirit and and the other person said and weeping I said yes the Bible said he that he that goth forth weeping shall doubtless return again bringing up with the him precious Shi hallelujah hallelujah am amen we you go sewing with weeping amen but when we come back again we shall bring precious Shields brother where is the Weeping in the church where is the breaking in the church whereby you sit like an officer in the church whereby you sit like a religious man woman why you see like somebody who is so holy oh let me tell you brother let us go back again to that oldfashioned religion where we break where when we hear the word say oh God I'm that sinner talking about have mercy on me and you are not ashamed to cry to break down you are not ashamed why because it is something to you it is a real reality you are not just faking Christianity we come here because we are bad and we want to be made good and if we are bad indeed when we hear the word of God it will send us into tears it will send us into saying amen it will make us emotional it will make us tional emotion doesn't change us but we are emotional because we are being changed hallelujah hallelujah he say that's right let me tell you if you don't have those people who say Amen if we don't have the people who are crying then we can't have church let us not go back where we came from we came from dead places and that's the truth where you can even hear a need of falling I don't know let me tell you these things that I'm talking about some of you don't know because all you have known is Pentecostalism and even the Pentecostalism you have known is the c one but some of us we were very reserved Christians myself I was I was in an Anglican Church I was very foral when they sing when they sing a song do you know how to play like them brother sh do you know how they play get oh you don't know I was asking you to get on the piano now I show you how who knows how to play like that just go there and begin stand up stand up for Jesus can you get do something for me I want to show you Church and and we were in bondage we were in bondage and you know they would begin stand up stand up for [Music] Jus now when you feel that the song is touching you feel like tapping the best you can do is to tap the the feet but even when you do that someone looks at you and and you stop and you keep it all inside and that's why I'm saying we were liberated we did not come here to be like that we came here to be free we are a free people why because we have entered into The Potter's House we have come here to be broken to be broken into many pieces whereby all our pride Di and we are born again amen amen by in the Porter's hands he takes us into his hand and he molds another man he molds another character oh my hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen put the first things first so [Music] breaking up making over then just come rejoicing praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah and here in The Book of Mark 14:34 and Jesus said unto them my soul is exceedingly sorrowful unto death you here and watch and he went forward a little and fell on the ground if it were possible the hour might pass from him I wanted to see and he said father all things are possible unto you take away this cup from me this was Jesus this was Jesus our savior Our Redeemer and he says his soul was exceeding sorrowful un death and he went forward a little he left the disciples behind and when he reached there I would demonstrate for you but you won't see me fell down he didn't go down slowly like a religious man he fell down and as soon as he fell down he didn't behave as if he was praying in the house where is praying in the heart he was speaking words of desperation he fell to the ground and he prayed AB father all things are possible unto you take away this cup from me he didn't want to die he was trying to run away from dying but he says nevertheless not what I will but what you will let me show you something here Jesus feared the hour of death he had to come to The Potter's House Jesus entered into the Porter's house and that hour of fear and he fell down how do you enter in by prayer in here he had to have his own human will broken the way you can do do this is only through prayer and consecration not where everybody is personal private devotional prayer forget about the prayers we do in the church that's not what I'm talking about Jesus went with his disciples but when it reached that point of entering into the P's house he left them he left them behind and he went to another place alone he went to fight it out his will was I cannot die so you f it I canot take I I cannot no no no no no no no your word tells me that I cannot fornicate I want to he fought his flesh he fought his will he fought his desire he fought against it he he he was wrestling it together with God your will versus the word his will versus God word and he had to accept at the end of it all when he was walking out of The Potter's House he had to accept to die he says nevertheless not according to my will but according to your will we do we have to accept to die we have to accept to die to our self righteousness we have to accept to die to our pride drop and throw away your pride brother accept what the word is telling you accept to D your flesh accept to D your own understanding even that your own cultures that our wear accept and throw it away accept die to your cultures accept die to your tempers except it's a battle friends it's not it is easier said than done but we have to accept to die if you a liar accept to die to that demon of Lies accept that that Spirit of fornication and except to die you know to don't I tell a little Li and doesn't God doesn't mind fight it through prayer let your will die accept his word if the Bible says be baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ accept that your [Music] unbelief and be born again and accept him as your savior and be baptized in his name if you don't accept then you have ran away from the Porter's house and you will remain with your pride and the Bible tells us that Pride precedes the fall and when you fall there will be no restoration for but when you accept to be broken you'll be ridiculed you'll be called a lot of things by your friends by your Associates sometimes by your family but you have to be willing to carry the cross of Jesus you have to be willing to take to to to to die to self he says forgive our many weakness Lord we don't we do many mistakes so in order to stay alive in Christ we have to die to our own thoughts so keep us [Applause] dead to ourselves and alive in him is that your prayer tonight let our body be soul and our soul so submissive to him to him that people will see the reflection of Christ as we go oh come or whatever we do Colossians 3:1 it says if he then be reason with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on things on the earth for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our life shall appear then ye also appear with him in I believe that with all my heart we shall appear with him in how many believe that we shall appear with him in glory and that was only 1% of what I had you may stand for because our time is done hallelujah I just want to be broken we have to accept to be broken because if you don't break you cannot be accepted in his presence his word cannot have any effect upon you how many would say Lord break me and make me let us pray for you Lord Jesus there are some on zoom and others here and maybe others on YouTube praying Lord break me so that you can be able to make me again Lord here I am in the pter house I'm the clay you are the porter mold me mold your people father bring them to that place of sacrifice whereby they're not moving according to their will but according to your will not according to their thoughts but according to your thought and your word is your thought and your word is perfect it is forever settled in Heaven Help Us Lord
