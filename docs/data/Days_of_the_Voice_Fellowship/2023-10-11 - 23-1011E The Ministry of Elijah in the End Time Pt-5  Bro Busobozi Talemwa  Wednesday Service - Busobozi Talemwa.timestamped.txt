[3:13] speak in the name of Jesus
[3:16] Christ amen
[3:20] amen God bless
[3:24] you and also to you the Saints on Zoom
[3:26] I'm speaking to evening light by
[3:28] tabernac as well
[3:33] praise
[3:34] God so we would like to continue with
[3:37] Malachi
[3:44] 4
[3:48] 5 so maybe today we can begin from vers
[3:54] one if you do not know where Malachi is
[3:57] it is the last book in the Old Testament
[4:00] [Music]
[4:06] we will begin from verse one of chapter
[4:11] 4 for behold the day cometh that shall
[4:15] burn as an oven and all the proud year
[4:18] and all that do wickedly shall be
[4:20] stubble and the day that cometh shall
[4:23] burn them up sayith the Lord of HS that
[4:26] it shall leave them neither root nor
[4:28] branch
[4:48] but unto you that fear my name shall the
[4:50] son of
[4:51] righteousness rise arise with healing in
[4:55] in his wings and he shall go forth and
[4:58] grow up as sces of the
[5:13] stall and he shall tread down the wicked
[5:16] for they shall be ashes Under The Souls
[5:18] of your feet in the day that I shall do
[5:21] this sayith the Lord of
[5:28] hosts
[5:32] remember ye the Lord Moses my servant
[5:34] which I commanded him in horb for all
[5:37] Israel with the statutes and
[5:48] judgments behold I'll send you Elijah
[5:51] the prophet before the coming of the
[5:53] Great and the Dreadful day of the Lord
[5:55] and it shall turn the heart of the
[5:56] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[5:58] the children to the their fathers lest I
[6:00] come and smite the Earth with a
[6:20] curse amen you may be
[6:23] seated so this evening by God's grace
[6:26] I'm speaking to you on again the
[6:29] Ministry of elah in the end
[6:37] time this scripture which we have read
[6:40] tonight it is a
[6:42] prophecy and you know one thing about
[6:46] prophecy whether people know it or
[6:49] not it comes to
[6:51] pass whether you believe it or
[6:54] not it comes to
[6:56] pass prophecy is prophecy
[7:00] and prophecy happens regardless of what
[7:02] anybody thinks about
[7:05] it so the prophet that is spoken of here
[7:08] in the Book of
[7:11] Malachi is the one that the Bible speaks
[7:13] of that it would come before the day of
[7:17] the
[7:21] Lord in Mali here it says the day that
[7:24] shall burn as an
[7:26] [Music]
[7:28] oven is coming a day a day that will
[7:32] burn as an
[7:34] oven and the Bible says all the
[7:37] proud and all that do wickedly shall be
[7:42] stubble and that day that comes shall
[7:45] bur them
[7:49] up it shall leave them neither root nor
[7:54] Branch now we know that that day has not
[7:57] yet come
[8:00] and that day is
[8:02] coming and how does it
[8:04] begin it begins with the
[8:08] tribulation you see it will be the day
[8:10] of Vengeance of our
[8:13] God whereby those who refuse to
[8:16] believe those who refuse to believe the
[8:18] message of Elijah in the end
[8:22] time will have to
[8:25] pay with with their own
[8:28] blood and uh we thank God because Jesus
[8:33] Christ has a way for those that fear his
[8:37] name and those amen that Shall Believe
[8:41] on
[8:42] him it says the son of righteousness
[8:45] shall
[8:47] arise with healing in his
[8:51] wings and I believe that in this end
[8:54] time the son of God's
[8:58] righteousness Rison as as rose up
[9:01] brother to us with healing in his
[9:05] wings this enti message that we have
[9:08] received is healing in God's
[9:12] Wings in the Book of Revelation chapter
[9:16] three it talks
[9:19] about for the
[9:22] eyes if you were blind that you would be
[9:24] able to
[9:26] see so it comes with healing
[9:30] when God brings his
[9:32] word his word comes with
[9:34] healing healing not only for your
[9:37] body but healing for your
[9:40] soul how many appreciate God's healing
[9:42] for their souls
[9:44] tonight and now there are many people
[9:47] who will not actually see that God has
[9:49] has a promise for our end
[9:55] time and they think things are just
[9:58] happening but we know that things are
[10:00] not just
[10:02] happening we are walking in
[10:05] Prophecy even here we are walking in
[10:08] Prophecy even tonight we are walking in
[10:11] Prophecy did you know that the Bible say
[10:13] there is nothing new on
[10:16] Earth everything that
[10:19] is has been and everything that has
[10:23] been shall be so there's nothing
[10:26] new that's why God can never be
[10:31] surprised you know whatever
[10:33] happens God knew it before the
[10:36] foundation of the
[10:37] world and he knew that the world in the
[10:40] end time would be in the condition it is
[10:42] in
[10:45] today and that it would leave the
[10:47] principles of the
[10:50] word and that's why he promised a
[10:53] Ministry of to come and restore them
[10:55] back
[10:58] again
[11:00] now before we go into studying the
[11:03] ministry of Elijah in the end time
[11:05] because that is also a part on its
[11:08] [Music]
[11:11] own a while now I've been dealing with
[11:14] the ministry of Elijah in the
[11:21] beginning uh because if we get to know
[11:24] or to understand perfectly how the
[11:27] ministry of Elijah worked in the
[11:28] beginning
[11:33] then we will surely understand without a
[11:35] doubt the ministry of elah in the end
[11:41] time is that aen church so now we
[11:44] understand
[11:45] here that when God sent Elijah in the
[11:49] beginning we' gone through it over and
[11:52] over that it was a
[11:55] time when Israel had
[11:57] Backle
[11:59] when Israel had left the principles of
[12:01] the
[12:03] word and so God sent
[12:07] Elijah bring back the things in
[12:13] order and we have read a few accounts on
[12:16] Elijah and today we shall read one
[12:21] more but before we read
[12:24] that in the book of First Kings
[12:27] 17
[12:30] I'd like us to look at what brother bam
[12:31] has to say a little bit about
[12:37] Jezebel because at the time when Elijah
[12:42] came you
[12:44] know the king Ahab had decided to marry
[12:47] a woman from among the
[12:50] [Music]
[12:52] unbelievers and really from this we
[12:53] should
[12:55] learn that Believers always Mar
[12:57] believers
[13:01] praise God because when the king decided
[13:04] to marry an
[13:06] unbeliever he also with
[13:09] her and he left the glory of
[13:12] God and Jezebel took up the place which
[13:16] was not supposed to take
[13:19] up the listen the earliest place you can
[13:22] see in the Bible of a woman
[13:27] preacher
[13:30] is
[13:31] Eve when Eve was
[13:34] preaching you remember what
[13:36] happened you remember what happened when
[13:38] Eve preached because when the serpent
[13:42] came Eve started preaching to The
[13:46] Serpent and the Bible says the serpent
[13:49] was more subtle than any other
[13:52] Beast that the Lord God had
[13:55] met but Eve started preaching to the
[13:58] serpent
[14:01] and she was overly
[14:04] excited and she decided to add more
[14:08] words and she said that he said that we
[14:11] should not even touch
[14:14] it and when the woman added on the
[14:18] word the serpent took away from the
[14:22] word because the serpent said You shall
[14:25] surely not
[14:27] die and that was taking away from the
[14:31] world but you see the serpent could not
[14:34] defeat the
[14:36] woman unless the woman had first left
[14:39] her place in the
[14:42] word so she had to First leave her
[14:45] place for the serent to be able to
[14:47] penetrate her her
[14:51] faith as long as the Bride of Jesus in
[14:54] this end time can stay with the
[14:57] word devil will try to
[15:00] fight but he cannot
[15:02] Prevail that's why Jesus in The Book of
[15:05] Matthew says that Upon This Rock I'll
[15:08] build my
[15:09] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[15:14] Prevail why do you think they will not
[15:17] Prevail is it because you are so
[15:20] powerful or because you are so solid on
[15:22] your
[15:23] faith remember now we are living in a
[15:26] generation or time of
[15:27] sin
[15:29] but at the time of Eve there was no
[15:32] sin you know Eve was the first one to
[15:36] sin in the book of First Timothy chapter
[15:39] chapter
[15:40] 3 the Bible says the woman was in the
[15:45] transgression not the man but the woman
[15:48] she was the very first one to
[15:51] see so in other words she was as
[15:54] perfect almost as Adam
[15:57] was were
[15:59] holy so how come that they could
[16:04] fall how come that Eve could fall
[16:08] away from that
[16:10] Perfection yet she was that perfect and
[16:13] that
[16:15] powerful solid on the
[16:17] face the only thing that made he
[16:21] fall was that she she went away from her
[16:25] place she was removed from her place
[16:29] and what was her place her place was
[16:32] absolute faith in the word of
[16:37] God and what is the original sin the
[16:41] original sin is
[16:46] unbelief stopped believing the
[16:49] word and when she stopped believing the
[16:52] word she added on the word and then what
[16:56] came out of it as a result
[17:00] the
[17:00] adultery was a result of
[17:04] sin was the fruit of
[17:07] sin and so if that way she lost her
[17:10] first
[17:13] estate Adam too lost his first
[17:17] estate and now the Bible says for all
[17:20] have
[17:22] sinned but yet we see again the Bible
[17:26] saying you know speaking of Jesus
[17:29] and he said that Jesus was the uh you
[17:31] know was the new creation of
[17:35] God now listen through through
[17:38] Adam the first Adam all men
[17:42] sin through Adam the
[17:45] second all
[17:47] men receive the new
[17:51] birth because you are born in your first
[17:56] nature you are born with the nature of
[18:00] sin you did not choose it it chose
[18:05] you so you are not you are not a sinner
[18:08] by by choice that
[18:12] much you are a sinner by
[18:17] Nature Apostle Paul said it this
[18:20] way you were you were children of
[18:24] Wrath by
[18:26] Nature children of WRA Born to Die born
[18:32] in sin but there is another
[18:35] birth whoever hears the message whoever
[18:39] hear has the gospel she will be like
[18:41] Mary
[18:42] now amen when when the angel of the Lord
[18:45] came and Mary heard the words of the
[18:50] Angel Mary accepted she said be it unto
[18:54] me according to your
[18:56] word she accepted all the word and
[18:59] because she accepted all the word she
[19:02] stayed in her
[19:03] place her place of
[19:06] Faith the place of the church is the
[19:10] place of
[19:14] Faith your place is to believe every
[19:17] word but the moment you move away from
[19:20] that you are no longer a
[19:23] Believer you are
[19:26] backing and that's why you see all the
[19:28] teachings we have in our
[19:32] generation because the church has
[19:36] Backle through their denominational
[19:40] doctrines people will stop will not
[19:42] believe what you telling
[19:44] them not because they are using the
[19:47] filter of the
[19:50] word but because they're using the
[19:52] filter of their Church
[19:57] doctrines so these things are very
[19:59] important that I'm speaking in in this
[20:01] series
[20:04] really and I'm going to hammer it
[20:09] continually until the Lord will reveal
[20:12] them personally to each of
[20:15] us we need to understand the ministry of
[20:18] Elijah in the end
[20:21] time praise the name of the Lord and
[20:24] then there is a second
[20:26] Eve the first Eve fell
[20:29] hallelujah hallelujah through the first
[20:31] Adam all received
[20:34] death but through the second Eve rather
[20:37] through the second
[20:39] Adam all attained eternal
[20:41] life who is the second Adam Jesus Christ
[20:46] and who is the second Eve the church we
[20:49] are the second
[20:51] Eve but what has
[20:53] happened the second
[20:55] Eve she has
[21:00] back the church has
[21:03] back but God promised a
[21:07] restoration within the
[21:10] church within the the church God calls
[21:14] out a
[21:16] bride who cannot
[21:18] fall cannot
[21:21] backslide regardless of all that she
[21:23] goes
[21:24] through it has already been written in
[21:27] glory that she will
[21:29] overcome I believe I am part of that
[21:33] bride who will hear every word of
[21:36] God and then after
[21:38] Eve the second woman preacher we
[21:42] see
[21:45] wasel Jezebel was one of the women that
[21:49] actually thought that she would teach
[21:50] the prophets of
[21:53] God and before I continue I'll tell you
[21:56] right away that Jezebel is a type of of
[21:58] the religious order of Our
[22:04] Generation because spiritually
[22:07] speaking the
[22:08] church is a
[22:11] woman a woman is a type of the
[22:15] church so when you hear
[22:18] Jezebel we are talking about the
[22:21] church and and what the church when
[22:24] Jezebel came with her wrong doctrines
[22:29] making the king and Israel to
[22:34] backslide
[22:36] God had a had a way out for his
[22:41] children and last time we talked about
[22:44] constantin's
[22:47] idea you know the first when the first
[22:49] denomination was
[22:52] formed and we talked about how Jezebel
[22:55] married
[22:56] Ahab
[22:59] and this
[23:00] Union was was against the scripture the
[23:04] word it was aop political
[23:10] union was not based on the
[23:14] word and the union listen the union of
[23:17] Jezebel
[23:20] and spiritually
[23:22] speaking is like the union that took
[23:25] place in the third century
[23:31] between
[23:33] Constantin and the
[23:36] church
[23:38] Constantine was a
[23:41] politician who actually United the
[23:44] church with
[23:47] politics and and and if you
[23:50] notice brother says it was Constantine's
[23:54] idea to get everyone
[23:56] together
[24:02] the pagans the nominal
[24:06] Christians and the true
[24:08] Christians because we had those ones who
[24:10] were calling themselves
[24:12] Christians but not the true ones and we
[24:16] had the pagans and we had the true
[24:18] Christians but it was the idea of
[24:21] Emperor
[24:24] constan bring all of them
[24:26] together
[24:28] and for a while it looked as if he would
[24:32] succeed for the real Believers came
[24:34] along to see if they could bring back
[24:36] the ones that had drifted away from the
[24:43] word let me tell you this many times
[24:47] when you tell someone the
[24:49] truth and some of you have tried to
[24:51] testify can also testify to
[24:55] this when you tell someone the truth
[24:59] usually the first thing some people will
[25:01] say oh this is the truth I am going to
[25:05] go and change my
[25:07] denomination I'm going to go and and I
[25:09] will not come out but I will remain
[25:13] change them you know you cannot change a
[25:17] dead
[25:19] system but says when they denominate
[25:22] they
[25:24] die if they decid to baptize younger
[25:26] babies
[25:28] you cannot change that there is only
[25:31] always one
[25:33] solution
[25:35] separation always the word of God listen
[25:38] the word of God calls for a total
[25:43] separation total separation from
[25:47] unbelief you cannot you cannot stay
[25:50] United with
[25:53] unbelief and then you think that God
[25:55] will use
[25:56] you you know just like people who want
[25:59] to keep friendship with the
[26:02] world the Bible says friendship with the
[26:06] world is enity with
[26:10] God we the word of God calls us to come
[26:14] to a place of total
[26:20] separation not some
[26:22] separation total separation from
[26:26] unbelief separation from the
[26:29] world toal separation from
[26:32] denominations listen that's why the
[26:34] Church of of Jesus
[26:36] Christ should never come into any
[26:41] Unity with any
[26:44] denomination that's why we can never be
[26:46] under any
[26:49] umbrella any
[26:52] denomination that's why brother bam told
[26:56] that every Church every local
[26:59] church is
[27:02] Sovereign and the past of that
[27:05] church is the final
[27:08] Authority the past of that
[27:11] church he also uses the
[27:14] word and the Holy Spirit so really every
[27:18] member of the
[27:20] church is under one
[27:23] thing the word and the Holy
[27:25] Ghost that's the final authority of
[27:28] every
[27:30] Fellowship but we see here they try to
[27:35] unite and to be under to be
[27:40] together and the Believers thought H let
[27:43] us go we shall bring them back again to
[27:44] the
[27:47] truth but when they saw that they
[27:49] couldn't bring them back into the
[27:53] truth they were forced to break away
[27:55] from the body
[27:56] political
[28:00] then when they did they were called
[28:03] Heretics and
[28:09] persecuted some people when they believe
[28:11] this
[28:12] message they don't want to be
[28:15] persecuted they don't want to be called
[28:19] Heretics but the True Church of Jesus
[28:23] Christ has always called been persecuted
[28:26] and always called
[28:29] let me tell you if the world or the
[28:32] friends in the
[28:34] world love you the same way before you
[28:39] believed there is something wrong
[28:43] somewhere if your
[28:45] friends don't find fault with
[28:47] you if they can't call you
[28:50] names they can't persecute you in any
[28:53] way it simply means they your
[28:56] friends and how can you be a
[29:00] friend with an idea that you don't stand
[29:05] for let me give you an
[29:07] example if you used to dress a certain
[29:11] way before you believe the
[29:13] message and in the
[29:16] world and you still be dressed the same
[29:19] way and you know you you have no problem
[29:23] with you you have no problem with
[29:24] them so it means you are still friends
[29:28] you are having
[29:29] Fellowship two fellows in a
[29:32] ship but when you believe Jesus
[29:37] Christ you should change he should
[29:40] change everywhere about
[29:43] you the way you dress they must be able
[29:46] to see it and they must be able to
[29:49] notice that there has been a
[29:51] change there is a song we used we sing
[29:53] that I've been changed I've been reborn
[29:55] all my life has been rearranged
[30:01] what a difference it
[30:04] made when Jesus came my way can can you
[30:07] be able to give that
[30:10] testimony when you come to Christ you
[30:13] must have a testimony of a
[30:17] change the world should not see you the
[30:20] same
[30:21] way you should not see things the same
[30:24] way there must be a permanent a
[30:27] permanent
[30:29] change and he continues on to say let me
[30:32] say right
[30:34] here that we have the very same thing
[30:36] going on right
[30:39] now the people are all coming
[30:42] together they are writing a Bible that
[30:45] will suit everyone whether it be a Jew
[30:47] Catholic or
[30:54] Protestant they have their only Council
[30:57] but they call it the ecumenical
[31:03] council and do you know whom all these
[31:05] organizations
[31:07] [Music]
[31:08] fight they fight listen they fight the
[31:12] true
[31:15] Pentecostal they don't fight
[31:17] Pentecostal they fight the true
[31:21] Pentecostals who are the true
[31:25] Pentecost who are the true pentec
[31:28] I want to say I am the true
[31:30] Pentecost the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[31:32] the true
[31:33] Pentecost the believer are the true
[31:36] Pentecostal and the whole agenda of
[31:39] Satan is against those true
[31:42] Pentecostal in the Days of Elijah Elijah
[31:46] was the true
[31:48] Pentecost a man that could pray and fire
[31:50] comes
[31:52] down that was a true
[31:54] Pentecostal a man that would go and R
[31:56] would feed
[31:58] him a man that would see Visions a man
[32:02] that would hear the voice of God a man
[32:05] that would you know be in the presence
[32:06] of God a man that would give a prophecy
[32:09] and it comes to
[32:11] pass I said that is a true
[32:14] Pentecostal and that is what the church
[32:17] needs that's why the Bride of Jesus
[32:21] should always not be far from
[32:24] that the true church of the end times
[32:28] will not be far from Acts chapter
[32:32] 2 they will be right there through Bible
[32:36] bestas
[32:39] Pentecostal having the same word having
[32:42] the same power having the same SS and
[32:45] wonders having the same
[32:47] manifestations having the same
[32:49] way that is how you know the true
[32:53] church when they have the same God of
[32:56] Elijah when when when when Elijah
[33:00] left the power never
[33:02] left the spirit of Elijah stay or the
[33:06] spirit which was on
[33:07] Elijah which is the spirit of Jesus
[33:10] Christ which is the spirit of God
[33:13] himself and I am so happy that I'm a
[33:16] true
[33:20] Pentecostal praise
[33:22] God and he continues on to
[33:25] say they fight the through
[33:29] Pentecostals I don't mean the
[33:31] organization called
[33:33] Pentecostal I mean the ones who are
[33:36] Pentecostal because they are filled with
[33:37] the Holy
[33:40] Ghost because they are filled with the
[33:42] Holy
[33:43] Ghost oh hallelujah hallelujah and they
[33:46] have the
[33:48] signs and the gifts in their
[33:52] Med because they walk in
[33:55] truth oh God bless you my brothers and
[34:00] sisters this should we should hunger for
[34:03] this if you're not seeing it in your
[34:06] mid don't say it is no longer
[34:10] here it is still here if you don't have
[34:14] it hunger for
[34:16] it if you don't have it you know desire
[34:20] it let me say this we we still believe
[34:24] in signs and
[34:25] gifts we believe in the Holy Ghost we
[34:29] believe in we believe in being filled
[34:31] with the Holy
[34:32] Ghost we believe in Walking In
[34:36] Truth says here those are the true
[34:42] Pentecostals praise
[34:46] God when I have married
[34:49] Jezebel for political
[34:52] reasons he sold his birth
[34:55] right you join up with organization and
[34:57] you sell your
[35:00] birth brother whether you want to
[35:02] believe it or
[35:04] not every Protestant group that ever
[35:07] came out and then went back sold their
[35:10] birth
[35:11] [Music]
[35:17] right and when you sell your birth R you
[35:19] are just
[35:22] like you can cry and repent all you want
[35:25] but it won't do you any good
[35:29] there is only one thing you can
[35:32] do and that is come out of her my
[35:36] people and stop taking over
[35:40] sin now if you don't think I am
[35:43] right just answer this one question can
[35:46] any man living tell me what church or
[35:49] what move of God ever had Revival and
[35:51] came back after she went into an
[35:55] organization
[36:02] and became a
[36:04] denomination read your histories you
[36:06] can't find not even
[36:08] one it was the Midnight Hour for Israel
[36:12] when she joined with the world and left
[36:14] the spiritual for the
[36:17] [Music]
[36:22] political it was the Midnight Hour of
[36:25] atesia when the church did the same
[36:29] thing it is the Midnight Hour now that
[36:32] the church are coming together the
[36:34] churches are coming
[36:38] together have you not heard about the
[36:40] world ccil of
[36:42] churches even he what you seeing
[36:44] happening in our
[36:46] country church is coming
[36:49] together ask
[36:51] yourself how can they be
[36:54] United when they don't believe the same
[36:58] thing how Unity is the unity of the
[37:05] faith we must have Unity of the
[37:08] faith but what they are having is unity
[37:12] of
[37:13] denominations Unity of
[37:15] denominations can never bring Unity of
[37:18] the
[37:19] faith and that's why all of them put
[37:23] together they cannot even believe in
[37:25] baptism in the the name of our Lord
[37:27] Jesus
[37:29] Christ they cannot believe things that
[37:31] are spoken in the
[37:32] Bible each of them has their
[37:36] Doctrine and brother bam says it is the
[37:39] Midnight
[37:41] Hour end time now when married
[37:46] Jezebel he he allowed that to take the
[37:49] money and erect two huge houses of
[37:51] worship of and
[37:55] B
[37:57] the one that was erected for Bal was big
[37:59] enough for all Israel to come and
[38:01] worship there
[38:06] at and when Constantine and the church
[38:11] married gave the church
[38:14] buildings and set up altars and
[38:18] images and organized the hierarchy that
[38:21] had already been shaping
[38:25] up
[38:32] when Jezebel got the power of the
[38:36] state behind her she forced her religion
[38:40] on the people that killed the prophets
[38:42] and the priests of
[38:48] God listen Church what we call the what
[38:53] we call the one world
[38:55] order
[38:58] it is
[38:59] coming one world
[39:02] religion One World
[39:05] Government these things are
[39:09] not it is going to
[39:12] happen be
[39:14] prepared get ready for the
[39:16] Rapture because if you are not ready it
[39:20] will happen and you will not because
[39:22] you're hearing it
[39:25] now just preaching to impress you I'm
[39:29] giving you prophetic utterances
[39:32] here these things are going to
[39:36] happen get ready that's why the message
[39:39] of
[39:40] Elijah is to make us
[39:43] ready to prepare us for the coming of
[39:46] the
[39:49] Lord and so he says here the moment
[39:54] jeel had you know the state behind
[40:00] her she now began to force her religion
[40:03] on
[40:06] everybody she now kill the priests and
[40:08] the prophets of
[40:10] God and this
[40:12] Jezebel is here again in our
[40:16] generation this religious
[40:19] spirit
[40:21] Jezebel wrong Church wrong de
[40:25] religion
[40:27] which is going to form a a worldwide
[40:31] wrong
[40:34] church one worldwide
[40:37] religion and everyone will be listen
[40:40] will right now is just
[40:43] forming but the moment
[40:46] Rome has political
[40:51] power after all the worlders
[40:54] United they will have to
[40:58] enforce their religious
[41:00] systems on
[41:03] everyone the Bible talks about the mark
[41:05] of the
[41:06] beast and the Bible says you know if you
[41:10] don't have that
[41:11] Mark on your forehead or on your right
[41:15] hand you won't be allowed to
[41:18] sell or to buy you won't be allowed
[41:22] unless if you have the
[41:24] mark but let me tell you we have been
[41:27] told by the prophet of Mali
[41:29] 4 how are they going to receive that
[41:32] Mark they going to receive the mark of
[41:35] on the on the
[41:36] forehead by wrong
[41:39] doctrines by accepting wrong
[41:42] teachings like infant
[41:44] baptism accepting women preachers in
[41:47] their churches you know and and and the
[41:50] you know the this denominational
[41:52] spirits that is sweeping all over the
[41:55] world by accepting those
[41:58] spirits and doctrines which are just
[42:01] traditions of
[42:04] men not in the
[42:06] Bible doctrines like
[42:09] penitence doctrines like you know you
[42:14] know doctrines like you know all those
[42:17] teachings the worship of of a
[42:20] woman you know replacing
[42:24] Faith with the Lord
[42:28] and a whole combination of
[42:32] things by accepting those wrong
[42:35] teachings the Trinity by accepting those
[42:39] doctrines teachings which are not in the
[42:42] Bible by accepting those wrong
[42:45] teachings They will receive the mark of
[42:47] the
[42:49] beast in their
[42:52] forehead by accepting to believe those
[42:55] things and if you are hearing me and you
[42:57] have already accepted
[42:59] them you still have a
[43:02] chance the Bible says the only chance is
[43:06] come out of her my
[43:08] people be not partakers of our
[43:11] sin come out of her be ye separate that
[43:15] is the only hope the time is coming when
[43:19] there will be no hope
[43:22] anymore and then by the right hand
[43:26] that is by the
[43:28] fellowship fellowshipping with those
[43:30] that don't believe the right
[43:33] doctrines how is that Fellowship going
[43:35] to
[43:37] be by accepting to come under one Union
[43:40] with
[43:41] them okay we don't believe the same
[43:44] thing but let us be brothers and then
[43:48] you shake hands and then you make an
[43:51] organization CC of churches and we are
[43:54] all under that being under that even if
[43:58] you don't believe what they believe you
[44:00] have received the mark of the
[44:02] beast by your by by your right
[44:05] hand of
[44:07] Fellowship thank God for the end time
[44:09] message thank God for the Elijah in the
[44:12] end time because now we know and we came
[44:16] out of that
[44:18] nonsense Hallelujah we are being
[44:20] restored back again to the foundations
[44:23] of the
[44:24] world praise God God and wait for
[44:27] Jezebel to receive that power behind
[44:30] her she began persecuting and killing
[44:33] the
[44:34] Propet but where was
[44:36] Elijah Elijah never went out that
[44:40] Union Elijah never believed what Jezebel
[44:44] said elah refused to go under
[44:48] that elah was not was opposing all those
[44:51] other
[44:52] prophets one man versus all the other
[44:57] let me tell you one man in the hands of
[45:00] God will defeat all the demons in
[45:04] Hell thank God for the Elijah in our
[45:08] time because one man has opposed all the
[45:12] religious denomination of
[45:15] Doctrine and called him all sorts of
[45:19] Nam but that has helped the bride in
[45:23] our so it is so bad
[45:27] that Elijah the messenger of to his
[45:30] day thought he was the only one
[45:34] left but God had 7,000
[45:38] more need
[45:41] to oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[45:45] even if God used Elijah in that
[45:48] generation God had more
[45:52] 7,000 more
[45:54] 7,000 in every nation I believe I am
[45:58] among them Hallelujah who will not bow
[46:04] and God of
[46:06] Jezebel and right now out there among
[46:09] among this those denominations of
[46:11] Baptist
[46:15] Methodist there are some that will come
[46:18] out and come back to God this message
[46:23] let me declare this to you now this
[46:25] message is going to call them from every
[46:29] denomination on
[46:31] Earth from Baptist they will come out
[46:34] from methodists will come out from
[46:37] larians Catholics from angc from Muslims
[46:42] from everywhere they will come out from
[46:45] Adventist they will come
[46:47] out what is this this is not another
[46:51] religion we have not been called from
[46:53] our religion to our religion
[46:57] we are being called from a
[46:59] religion to Jesus
[47:01] Christ we are non
[47:04] denominational we are believers of the
[47:07] message of elah in
[47:09] theend we have accepted the end time
[47:13] message which has turned our
[47:16] hearts back again to the original
[47:19] Faith praise God I want you to know I am
[47:24] not and brother bam here is saying
[47:27] something I want you to know I am
[47:31] not now and never have ever been against
[47:34] the
[47:35] [Music]
[47:40] people it is the
[47:42] denomination when we say
[47:45] Catholicism we don't mean the people
[47:47] there when we say
[47:50] Baptist we don't mean the people there
[47:53] we mean the systems that are lying to
[47:56] the
[47:58] people the bride will come out of
[48:01] them it is the
[48:03] denomination the systems of
[48:05] organization that I am against I have to
[48:08] be against it for God hats
[48:11] it so you see the bride where is the
[48:15] bride going to come
[48:16] from the bride is going to be
[48:20] raptured out of all those
[48:24] denominations
[48:26] out of
[48:27] theel out of the Miracle
[48:30] Center the bride is going to come out of
[48:34] everywhere but God is not the author of
[48:37] confusion he doesn't come when they are
[48:40] there he comes he he removes them
[48:44] first he prepares them he fills them
[48:47] with the Holy Ghost and he sets them and
[48:50] makes them
[48:52] ready and then off they go to the
[48:54] Rapture when he comes
[48:56] that's what this message is all
[48:59] about it's a preparation
[49:01] message hallelujah we're being
[49:05] prepared for the coming of the
[49:07] Lord Jezebel became the power that
[49:09] controlled the
[49:11] king she controlled the king but you
[49:16] see there was a
[49:19] time and that was the
[49:21] time that was appropriate for God to
[49:23] send
[49:24] Elijah
[49:27] and Elijah came on the
[49:30] scene to restore back the
[49:33] truth our Jezebel
[49:37] religion is already here trying to
[49:40] control the
[49:41] king to control the world to control the
[49:44] peop of the world but this is the
[49:47] time that God should send
[49:50] Elijah this is the time that Elijah
[49:53] should come to restore us
[49:56] amen while I finish let us read First
[49:58] Kings
[50:02] 17:17 and it came to pass after these
[50:05] things that the son of the woman the
[50:07] Mistress of the house fell sick and his
[50:09] sickness was so sore that there was no
[50:12] breath left in
[50:21] him okay because of time let me read it
[50:23] only in English and she said unto Elijah
[50:25] what have I to do with thee Oh thou man
[50:27] of God at Thou come unto me to call my
[50:30] sin to remembrance and to slay my son
[50:33] and he said unto her give me thy son and
[50:36] he took him out of her bossom and
[50:39] carried him up into a loft where he
[50:41] aboard and laid him upon his own bed and
[50:44] he cried unto the Lord and said oh Lord
[50:46] my God hast thou also brought evil upon
[50:49] the Widow with whom i s John by slaying
[50:52] his son her son and uh and he stretched
[50:55] himself upon the child three times and
[50:58] Cried unto the Lord and said oh Lord my
[51:00] God I pray thee let this childish Soul
[51:03] come into him again and the Lord heard
[51:05] the voice of Elijah and the soul of the
[51:08] child came into him again and he
[51:10] revived he was restored amen and Elijah
[51:14] took the child and brought him down out
[51:16] of the chamber into the house and
[51:18] delivered him unto his mother and Elijah
[51:20] said see thy son liveth and the woman
[51:23] said unto Elijah now by this I know that
[51:27] thou art a man of God and that the word
[51:29] of the Lord is in thy mou that is in thy
[51:32] mouth is
[51:33] truth this is the god of Elijah amen
[51:39] hallelujah you know when this child
[51:42] died you know you need to understand
[51:44] this miracle was repeated under Elijah's
[51:49] Ministry in The Next Step I'll be able
[51:51] to show you how the ministry of Elijah
[51:54] actually is in continuation even after
[51:56] Elijah was
[52:02] taken continued with
[52:04] elishah and from elishah it continued on
[52:08] to John the
[52:10] Baptist and from John the Baptist it
[52:12] continues on to William
[52:14] Bram from William Bram it continues on
[52:17] to another man who goes to
[52:22] Israel and that's how the ministry of
[52:24] Elijah ends
[52:27] so now we will talk about that
[52:29] later but now I want you to look at the
[52:31] beginning of it
[52:33] here when Elijah came when he came to
[52:36] this woman only having a little thing
[52:40] for her to
[52:42] die but you know uh you know you know
[52:45] how what God did
[52:47] then and then this this man of
[52:50] God was um just around when the the
[52:54] woman come
[52:56] comes and says you see the child gets
[53:00] sick and then
[53:02] dies there was no breath in
[53:05] him and said unto Elijah what do I have
[53:08] to do with
[53:09] you now listen when the ministry of
[53:13] Elijah
[53:14] comes it doesn't matter the
[53:18] situation this child died after the
[53:21] woman had received
[53:24] Elijah
[53:27] and the child died let me ask you a
[53:30] question why why did God allow
[53:33] it God allowed it so that this can
[53:37] happen and the woman said to
[53:40] Elijah now by this I know that thou a
[53:45] man of
[53:47] God and the word of the Lord in thy
[53:50] mouth is
[53:54] truth God allows bad situations to come
[53:57] to
[53:58] us so that we we can
[54:02] recognize the ministry he has sent to us
[54:05] in our
[54:07] time we have if we have the ministry of
[54:11] Elijah then the god of
[54:14] Elijah must do the same thing he did at
[54:17] this
[54:19] time if you are in a bad
[54:22] condition in your life you must be able
[54:25] to
[54:26] go to the god of
[54:29] el and tell him if you are of
[54:32] God here is my
[54:34] situation here is my problem if you are
[54:37] the same God of
[54:39] el tell me what should I do don't fear
[54:43] to challenge
[54:45] God challenge God over any
[54:49] condition Hallelujah if you meet the
[54:52] same
[54:53] conditions that this woman
[54:56] made she accepted the word but she
[54:59] needed Vindication of that word in her
[55:04] life the message is
[55:07] Vindicated elah was Vindicated by God
[55:11] but this woman needed that
[55:15] Vindication in her personal
[55:19] life when the god of Elijah came
[55:22] down Hallelujah
[55:25] oh hallelujah hallelujah he took that
[55:28] child he said what your child is dead
[55:32] give me the child Hallelujah he went
[55:35] right back to God again and he said God
[55:38] what about this situation and then God
[55:41] revealed to him what to do he stretched
[55:44] himself on the
[55:45] child three times
[55:48] justification sanctification baptism of
[55:51] the Holy Ghost when Elijah comes he
[55:55] comes with a full
[55:57] package his message Hallelujah justifies
[56:01] those need to justifi he sanctifies you
[56:04] when you need to be
[56:05] Sanctified amen amen if you believe it
[56:07] with all your heart it's the best for
[56:10] you to receive the B of the Holy
[56:12] Ghost that's why the proof that you have
[56:16] the Holy Ghost is by receiving the
[56:18] message of Elijah
[56:20] hey that is the proof by receiving the
[56:24] word of your
