[22:50] even this king
[23:07] esther chapter one from verse one and
[23:09] the two pretty much double ch it says
[23:12] how much powerful this king is
[23:16] now it came to pass in the days of
[23:19] asuras
[23:22] are surahs
[23:24] which reigned from india even unto
[23:27] ethiopia
[23:29] over 170
[23:32] provinces
[23:35] that in those days when the king asuras
[23:39] sat on the throne of his kingdom which
[23:43] was in
[23:45] the place the palace the palace
[23:57] [Music]
[24:13] [Music]
[24:17] mean

[24:24] over 120.
[24:27] [Music]
[24:30] starting
[24:41] we're counted as much as 120
[24:58] he was
[25:26] having all these kingdoms
[25:32] being a kindness of this
[25:34] being
[25:35] of this all provinces
[25:40] you
[26:06] when he requested her to come and to
[26:08] show her beauty for the people
[26:15] instead she stayed there and she had her
[26:18] own ceremony
[26:22] and she refused for the king that she
[26:24] will not come because she has her own
[26:26] ceremony here
[26:28] with other women
[26:36] she has forgotten who she is how she
[26:38] becomes yeah
[26:41] how she becomes even a king
[26:45] you do not want to recall she don't want
[26:47] to recognize the powers of the king
[27:04] he was very upset
[27:08] so
[27:09] they were about seven servants he
[27:12] servants
[27:31] so they bring a solution for the king
[27:36] and the uh and these servants
[27:39] they they propose him a good proposal
[27:44] for the king amina
[27:47] what did they propose
[27:55] we are also very upset for what is what
[27:58] she has done for you
[28:42] [Applause]
[29:32] when we are saying
[29:33] even when the cervantes propose this
[29:36] issue for the king
[29:48] [Applause]
[30:04] therefore
[30:05] they propose this uh good proposal
[30:11] so he was very pleased by the idea
[30:17] he comes
[30:18] you know
[30:48] so
[31:03] asuras was appeased
[31:06] he remembered vashti and what she had
[31:10] done
[31:11] and what was decreed against her
[31:15] then said the king cervantes that
[31:18] ministered unto him
[31:20] let there be fair
[31:22] young virgins sought for the king
[31:26] and let the king appoint officers in all
[31:28] the prophecies of his kingdom that they
[31:31] may gather together all the fair young
[31:34] virgins anto shushan the pla the place
[31:39] the palace to the houses of the women
[31:42] unto the custody of hege the king's
[31:46] chamberlain keeper of the women and let
[31:49] their things for purification be given
[31:52] them uh
[32:55] which pleases the king be killed instead
[32:57] of vashti
[32:59] and the thing pleased the king and he
[33:01] did so
[33:03] ah
[33:08] ah
[33:22] god is now requiring or god is now
[33:27] waiting for that uh marriage the love's
[33:31] marriage
[33:34] until he finds
[33:36] someone instead of vashti
[33:42] hallelujah amen
[33:45] so
[33:46] based on these uh
[33:48] points
[33:51] the king announces
[33:53] for every province or from every
[33:55] provinces
[33:57] these young men young uh young ladies
[34:00] young virgins starts to come
[34:46] for

[37:10] and the maiden verse 9 and the maiden
[37:13] pleased him and she obtained the
[37:15] kindness of him and he speedily gave her
[37:19] her things
[37:21] for purification with such things as
[37:24] belonger to her
[37:25] and seven medals which were meant to be
[37:29] given her out of the king's house and he
