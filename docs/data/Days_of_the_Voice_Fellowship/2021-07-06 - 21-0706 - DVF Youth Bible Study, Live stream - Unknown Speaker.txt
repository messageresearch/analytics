believe that you have had a wonderful time a wonderful uh beginning of the week amen now i see that i'm not here today which uh foreign what the devil will do is try to heal the young people to serve the lord but i just love it when young people say no i will serve a lot sister sarah i don't i don't know if she's on youtube is she a part of this meeting okay i am wondering how people can be alleged even for online meetings where the meetings are where the other changes are where they are but they're still late for reach it is really absurd you know it's always good for us as soon as young people to always be punctual it's always good to be punctual those who have come a bit early god bless god bless each of you and we have a wonderful time so we have questions and also we have a chapter to cover today we may not of course finish the whole chapter but at least we will uh we will be able to cover as much as we can be able to come for today praise the lord so how many have finished the batman's vision but you've not finished yet who hasn't finished the partner's vision where's your almost finishing okay only two are bad things why are you not proof okay but have you finished why are we not finished did you find a problem what happened really if you've not finished the fast motivation then it should happen [Music] [Music] um [Music] uh um [Music] uh [Music] uh they say that jesus is [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] brother [Music] okay is better now maybe somebody can try to get it is that better it will continue growing that's being produced apples instead but if the vine was a branch for his own it will produce oranges meaning that it was like jesus is defined and many other other patients have come and have been grafted and they think [Music] but if that that way produces a branch of its own it will produce we can produce oranges that is that with jesus if jesus can produce you can produce the original you can be an original christian like the christians and also i learned about the lonely day i like that the last day is the day of the day of okay so the first question where is your book do you want to show us where you read the first question that you've been trying to explain about the vines and the original branches and all that when those other branches were grafted in all they would do all they would do was bear their own food for they were not born of that veil they don't know about that original life and origin they don't know about that original life and original fruit they cannot know for they were not born in it but if they have been born in it the same life that was in the original stem jesus would have come to them and manifested through them john 14 john 14 12 says very literally i say and he has been [Music] the works that i do shall keep also and greater works than his shall he do because i go unto my father denominations which are man directed cannot be born of god for it is the spirit not man that gives life feeling is how clearly it is between all those seven livestreams let's see so i think uh i've been trying to look for my earphones so i can be able to monitor the sound but for some reason i'm not seeing them but from what the brother has been reading it is i don't know if others understand what he was trying to explain that he understands do you understand is there someone who doesn't understand why the brother was reading yes okay brother brother before what do you understand from what he was reading [Music] that the foreign but if another tree matches up we're talking about the original life you know there's a song we're seeing the original line the only genesis can you give us that song the original what is what i believe the son of man is revealed the seventh scene is unveiled the original the original sea that original life which was in the beginning it is the same life that we have today and it's the attributes of god manifested over time you know it's the same you know we last night we were trying to share with the on the video on the recording uh we we were recording those videos which we shall be sharing in the coming uh few days and we were talking on the about the original life coming from the very first age to the last age so we see that even today that original life of jesus christ can still be dressed and found how do you trust it by the attributes give me the first stanza by the by the attributes can you minimize that by the attributes it says that the attributes of god which were manifested to the bride in this day when you catch the diversion of this message then you know who you are and what you raised up for then you you know indeed that you have that right that original life that original world which is the original life not just accepting it but then you begin to see the life of jesus christ actually you know coming through your life so that's that was a very good highlight brother brother sam and god bless you for that uh we want brother you you want to say something okay 24 24 10 hours and still would not die they sent him he gave him as someone who was which was a witch because because why when was he naughty when was he not attacked when he was [Music] born silicone [Music] that's what i imagined so yes the yeah can you read that question you'll notice that jonas has addressed their christians as a brother in the foundation who's understood but the people themselves and the testimony of jesus christ when arrested they tried to prove to kill him by boiling him in oil for 24 hours and powerless officials they sentenced him in the button was that's a witch but god was with him and and he was scared to leave the island and until this time until until until until the time of this death so mainly what's the lessons large here uh what i learned in this in this small question and ready that as a christian loving just started and even when when jesus was going back he told his disciples they would be persecuted but they shouldn't give up so i also see that john was they tried him in well and failed certainly that god they're very good who said john still capable of taking us through all this and then also him going to the island of patmos that actually forgot to use him so i also learned that even in our hardest trials everything works for the goods for and also really to know that uh god yes when we become uh when we become a child of god or become believers persecution is going to come yes persecution must come to a believer if you are a believer if you're a child of god if you're a christian you will always be persecuted in one way or the other so you just have to know who you are and what you stand for and then also god stands for you but if you don't know who you are and what you stand before when persecution comes you just require giving up well give up but to a child of god they will never give up come on you say that very slowly you can't give up no matter what persecution comes to you you stay you keep keeping on until you overcome praise the lord amen that was quite a very outstanding another outstanding highlight now brother marvin i know that you have also learned a lot and there's quite a lot that you would love to share with us please would you uh go ahead and share with us what it is that you learned that you can highlight for us and uh you can use uganda no problem you can read in uganda okay fine if you want to read english you're reading why you're reading this are we going to church okay but uh you can highlight it for us in english i think for the purposes of those who can't understand is um is they don't go into the spirit [Music] [Music] um [Music] um [Music] um [Music] i'm [Music] uh [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] uh [Music] you know [Music] i [Music] [Applause] uh uh [Music] is [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] the music [Music] [Music] respect [Music] foreign [Music] so if you're a friend of mine [Music] is [Music] m [Music] all right [Music] [Applause] uh [Music] because uh [Music] [Applause] um [Music] oh [Music] [Music] um [Music] hello [Music] oh oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] up [Music] [Music] that is hidden from him that the lord did not know so i understand that now because john for him he went into the lord's day [Music] but now the lord is still masterful he's still masterful do you mind reading for us that portion which person are you looking for maybe someone can help you get it says that those very flaming eyes of that of the judge are even now recording the lives of all the flesh running to and from throughout the earth there is nothing he does not know he knows the desires of the heart and what each one intends to do there is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed for all things are naked before hearing with whom we have to do with whom we have to think of it he knows even now what you are thinking yes there he stands as a judge with a flaming eyes made out the judgment the day of the mercy is over all that men may bend and seek his face in his radius where there is yet time that they may make his bosom their pillar the world dissolves in the fire praise the lord so here it shows us that when we are seeing the days of man but after the days of man we are going to get into the lord's day and in that lord's day our god will not be will not be having any mercy or any compassion to the sinners praise the lord will be judging the heart he'll be judging us i'm not me judging the sinners praise the lord so here the prophet tells us that we should repent when there is when they still must we should seek him when he still when he can be found praise the lord because the time is coming when his eyes will ideally the flames of fire will not be had any compassion on each one of us if we we don't take the warning of the lord so we should do whatever it is needed when we are still having pain amen praise the lord now uh i appreciate you brother we have brought a very good point a point that uh we all need to look at actually you know when you excuse me in the seventh grade for glory of the person of christ we see yes he comes his air as well as snow his eyes has fire and the brother is trying to highlight his eyes as fire do you know that jesus the same jesus that came down on this earth and died and saved man from sin is the same one going to judge yes so but right now he is not yet a judge he is seated on the master seat oh you want to call the throne of mass whatever happens in your life now all you need to do is to go before him and repent so ask him for forgiveness ask his blood to wash your sins away and your sins will just disappear just like that did you hear it's like that to the extent that you won't remember them anymore for it will make us in the sea of forgetfulness but that same god his eyes now we see are shown as the eyes of fire yes this is now as a judge and uh on friday we are going to go through the seven-fold glory of his person and one by one and we'll be able to because it's very important for us to get to know but we will be able to find out he he is the same he was the savior man who came on earth and today he is the son of god we always pray to him to forgive ourselves but he's going to also come as a judge but may god have mercy so that by the time he comes he will come when we are ready and when we have accepted the benefit of his blood you know not because you are worthy but because you have accepted the benefit of this blood that makes you holy even as he is all right god bless you brother and please try to use uh a kind of [Music] a bigger voice so that everybody can be able to get in god bless you what's what's really touched me also in this chapter that atmosphere first of all uh his hair talks about his hair here he's as white as snow uh this all this was said by john when he had the voice and he looked again and you saw which is that watching thank you okay revelation chapter 1 verse 14 16 which which page page 53 okay now also you're speaking to some people near you you have to be at the cloud page 53 the second paragraph okay revelation chapter 1 verse 14 16. he said and his ears are white like wool as white as snow and his eyes are as a flame of fire and his feet like control the fires as if they burned in a furnace and his voice or the sound of many waters and he had that in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went that sharp great swag and he spoke and his conscience was as the sun shining mystery amen so now uh this chapter helped me to understand what actually this has this what it has mean this is the white hair means wisdom just as even as the human nature when many people believe that when you grow old you become weights and you get white hair so what will come in all wisdom uh it says the brilliant the white hair does not signify age but experience maturity and wisdom the eternal one does not age i mean so what is happening all wisdom of everything to judge the world then it also talks about his either the flame unfair as well explained uh there will no longer be any mercy it will just be judgment of the sinners his feet like to find like a two fine brush as if they burned in a furnace uh when we look at at his feet here it says in page 55 the fourth paragraph i say its brush is knotted for its remarkable hardness there's nothing that is known that you can put it in to temper it and also down here it says fine brush signifies divine judgments a judgment that god will decree and grow to pass i mean so we'll be coming with divine judgment [Music] then he talked about his voice his voice will be like like like the waters what it means actually that voice will be like the voice of the many prophets and the people jesus used the inside so there will be nothing to control yourself with [Music] you'll be judged by that god bless you for that and like i said we are going to speak more about the seven-fold glory of his person when we meet again on friday but here is one thing that i also wanted to speak on from what you just said by the follicle you know envy whatever singular gray hair is seen as a sign of age yes so now someone will say oh yeah what do you say that this one is the hd one the the very old one that's why some of them have the idea but there is god the father who is there with a lot of beers and then there who is a bit young again but by now if it is this if that is the case by now even the son is very old and maybe the father is about to die because for him at all now and then the son who is enough for him everywhere that's not right why because they go god according to john chapter 1 4 verse what 24 he says what john 4 24 what does it say got to worship he must watch him in the spirit and eat truth so god is not a man that ages with the time with a god there is no time how can something that happens we didn't be constrained by time god is the eternal one what is the word who is the eternal one what does it mean no beginning end that's why when we get into the spirit sometimes you worship and worship and feel like you don't want to leave that place you know what is happening around that same time you are you are entering into uh what i will call like eternity you are entering a little bit into eternity you are testing a little bit of eternity you feel like worshiping i don't know if you have ever prayed if you have never been in that um in that time or in that atmosphere then you've missed out much wherever you've been in a moment in a time where you worship and feel so straight you just say you know like that's that man what the song oh it is so sweet to trust in jesus you know you worship and pray and pray and if you're like oh i'm constrained by time i have to stop and then as you want to stop another inspiration comes you pray and pray and pray and pray when you are about to stop you do what you pray and pray and you understand if it has never happened to you seek for it you will enjoy it i tell you you know is when you are entering a little bit into living living time you know i would go outside supersonic speed leaving time and entering a little bit into eternity when you reach that you know when this man reached there hey john and i think peter they said you know what let us remain here please let us be on three days one for you one for your agent and one for moses and let us dwell here when you reach into the presence of god don't want to live you don't want to get out of it the other day all of us slept over why what happened did it wasn't planned what happened we entered in when you enter into the kind of glory into the presence of god into the holy of holies you feel like you are closing with god you are chatting with god you don't want to leave and now here we notice that white was not a symbol of age but it was a symbol which is a symbol of wisdom it's a symbol because it's remember it's coming as a judge now you know the right the judges wear the right wig what does it show it shows wisdom it shows that this is a you know even yeah you're gonna be where are they yeah yes there is a portion it says it's just experience maturity and wisdom it's just they know what they're doing they're not guessing at it they know what they're what they are doing so that's what it means you know and we will get deeper into that one man on friday okay brother okay god bless you all right please can you take it up now your sound your sound your sound sister blessings i don't know who is his blessings god bless you i see you are here on zoom if you put on your video that is nice i learned something from this vision this first you can know someone who has gotten distressed how can you know this person first of all specific [Music] subjects a little bit you will portray the nature of what people want then if you come out of that face you're also going to portray an age of someone who's interested is but one was arrested when provoking slow you will be strong just be you know take things easy then you can know that this person is understood to me that it's something that you need to live not only for a day or two [Music] this is what i learned from this scripture there are so many things i learned because of time i can read that why then back up by reading it pages let's see what the bible teaches us about this about first for he that is entered into his restaurant he is not only entering in but remaining in we don't get out yes it's not like a day that you would do every into a day and saturday suffer now i've got out of this down in another day now tomorrow will be seven when you enter of course you know it has to be your sin yes you're seen by the holy spirit so it's i cannot say it's a ceiling i can say it is a well you may use that i don't know how someone will understand it but well if you're still it means that you've been you know you've been sheltered from other things yes so which means you're putting rest at that yes you're in there so you're sealed you are sealed away from some things yes so i can say that the sabbath is really a place you enter in and you are still away from the rest of the world that's right praise the lord that's about powerful revelation ages okay is completion eight is the first day again jesus resurrection was in the first day of the week giving us his eternal life and eternal service thus we see why god could not give us any one certain day which israel would not do having only a shadow of the true substance which we enjoy why go back to the shadow then you have reality so before you continue because these are very important points and these are some of the things i wanted to talk about also so in other words when you enter into this sum of rest you have entered in and you are sealed away from the world right you agreed on that now there is something that you read there can you read that token again from here that last bit this isn't the last paragraph for page four we have entered into and do remaining which israel could not do having only a shadow of the true substance in other words israel could not be able to enter in and remain in that rest because to them the rest was not the rest was not what was not entering in like we are entering in the rest to them was a specific day of the week a time but for us now he said we do what can you read that question again says that we have entered into and we remain having only a shadow of the true substance which we enjoy you see what they had was not false do not say that uh what the jews were teaching was wrong no it was the commandment of the lord right but remember that it was a shackle everybody said it was a shadow so that was a shadow of the good things to come so it was a good shadow because it pointed to our rest which we are going to enter in and remain [Applause] is the first day of the week today is the summer now tomorrow again we go you understand yes in and out in and out just like there are high priests hallelujah he will enter into the holy one once a year meaning everywhere this year you will end the evening he entered in once and is jesus christ amen why did he enter inward and throw into the holy bodies because he had now brought the real sabbath the other was a shadow of the real servant but jesus christ brought a real sabbath and he said come unto me all year that neighbor and i have been and i will give you servers and what is that rest what is that rest what is it being closed out from the world and being closed in with god and what is it is receiving the whole dogs you receive the holy spirit you are sealed away from the world you are corrupted with jesus christ and you are no longer out there struggling with sin and fighting with sin those are your words you are not crushed in with jesus christ and you are receiving you are arrest you have received your what rest you have received from the world that's what the bible says now even when you die you cannot die if anyone has been in the christ is a new creature of course being is receiving the holy ghost all the things those are the works that you used to do are passed away behold all things are new and uh that's why they put on the lord jesus christ so now he continues on to say here and this is there oh oh yeah come complete that part thank you speak out your book we are all studying together don't uh yes i'm glad to see you sister uh what's the name of this sister blessings is yes sister please thank you for having your books there and following god bless you for that okay so all of you are here please i want you to have your book have your bible and follow okay yes so there's that part where are you ready where is it wait wait for the sixth paragraph too paragraph two right what does it say so let us not go back to work let's because we now have reality another lot reality reality has come what is reality reality is here but the shadow is the day saturn the seventh day of the week so ourselves are trying to tell us to go back to there but the question is why do we go back to us what do we have to add do you want a supper of god's reality and the light is here is the hospital receive the holy spirit the ministry oh wow i don't want to be listening now but the minister of jesus christ was to bring us back into the reality which the devil had strayed away from us and he needed to brought it back and we are glad to be back into the reality brother but the things you read it really put me on god bless you you can feel shy [Music] how we receive this rest of continuing sabbath is at the invitation of jesus he said in march 11 28 come unto me and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and man and you shall find rest because that's the keeping of the sabbath not a day amen thank matter how long you have been laboring under your lord of sin whether it is 10 years 30 years or 50 years or longer come with your tired weary life and you will find his wrist and that's the truth ah amen oh my word ought to say our man that's the truth what's the truth about you rest from your words because the word spirit now begins to work in you you're no longer working you think really good is concerned about you're going to dig or you're going to do this and that those are those who are shadows of the old testament so iraq's is not a he's not digging watching cookie you know our what is sins the words for the flesh the bible says the rights of the flesh are manifest and they are given to me now you don't know them kardashians bring it up brother put it up quickly you are there for a reason man the works of the flesh quickly quickly let's get to that let's get to that and then as brotherhood you're planning to prepare yourself yes i now see indeed you say that you do not have enough time to get out of your police father because i see they're quite very nice okay i garage see that name's very nice okay brush yes i could search the web for it oh you're not sitting here trying to give us something okay where is it here i can't see okay why are you beginning here it says no that's not the pattern this is the works of the village are manifest now what is this okay let me just look at myself yes no no no wait whenever you read one we continue we are we will start counting okay fornication and uncleanness less beast yes [Music] mothers these works of the threats you are breaking the law of the sabbath because the law of the south now is receiving race receiving rest from these works of the flesh which are drunkenness revealing you find them they have a cleaners they fornicate they have adultery they know about it as viciousness and all these things among them and yet they claim because they are keeping along the sabbath we should start a day they are going to heaven that is canality we thank god through jesus christ who has revealed to us but now the works that god minds about that we should drop from our lives and we should drop them not like you know like every step where after somebody i will run back to my my works that i've been doing you know it used to be in israel you live the works that you are doing you rest right and then you come back again and do them after suffer after when somebody is is come you drop them when you go back to start to rest then after somebody is over you go back to your racks right but now it's not like that anymore amen you rest one time hallelujah how do you respond will you receive the holy spirit when you receive the holy spirit you rest from all your works of the flesh once and for all just like jesus christ entered into the holy of holies once and for all now these words of the flesh you completely take them out of your life actually apostle paul said let you forget fornication not even be named among you just once for the question and if you're living about you because you're not being left among you these are what's in the flesh if one among you does these things they should repent and if they don't repent they should be cast out from among you you see why because god wants his purposes for us to be holy even as he amen praise the lord okay now let us give also to brother bully brother buddy please are you ready sister peace if you have something to share also we shall come to you god bless your church amen yeah brotherhood [Music] just move on spread god of god and obviously persecutions and acceptance but have faith because what will never leave you i want it from page 58 [Music] age each messenger brought the message like that house in the days they were serving his care for nothing to plug them out of his hand and made up for anything separate from the love of god burial nakedness feminine sword life or death they were truly concerned about persecution that came their pain and derision once but caused but cause to give glory to god that they were counted never to suffer for him these messengers last paragraph and this conference is not for the seven thousand eight messages only every true believer is in the hand of god and can grow from his love and power and receive the full benefit of all but what is to be that god obviously there will be persecutions him they put him in prison but he had the faith he never gave up when he was put in prison the angel was voting out and when he was then when he came out he went to preach god of god game so it was just continuous there is still you have faith and never give up then again in this same page where we read they are strength that's back to the world their strength was from the lord one never or they never would have stepped their time they were serving this care for nothing to pluck them out of his hand [Music] yes you you say that indeed uh we as children of god are going to suffer persecution we are going to suffer temptation we are also some of you might become sick some of us might become sick parents nakedness feminine sword life or death you know we are soldiers and as soldiers we are ready for anything whatever comes we are standing you know that song standing on the promises of christ thy lord through it are no edges let his praises ring o glory in the eyes [Music] i am standing on the promises now standing on the promises so [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] oh lift your voices is [Applause] together one more time [Music] [Applause] amen praise the lord we are standing on that promises no matter what comes and no matter what doesn't come we are still standing on the promises of god that's what children of god do praise the lord amen sister peace you have something that you have learned now we are moving on to the sisters uh if there is something that you have learned that you would like to share with us uh if there is just with your hands so i cannot mute you and then you can be able to okay i i i don't think she was ready to speak okay yes okay can you hold your phone i think it's the phone let me hold it so you can be able to see your face very well okay you can now speak [Music] look at um uh okay for some reason we cannot we cannot here use this stuff and so i'm requesting that uh you can type in what you wanted uh to share with us just type it in here on zoom or just send it by whatsapp i think you were adding the group and uh we shall be able to get that i think she's having a network challenge okay we'll get to the sisters who are here i think we begin in system all right please where are we started okay we start from there all right so this is unfortunate sister peace your network was a challenge please type in what you uh what is it that you wanted to share with us either here on chat

enter it you need forever yes self-driving has faced our lives certainly beatrice forever then i also learned about when when god was speaking to jordan john was here and that's how he works that's how german works then which portion is that well you can wear them very fast tonight isosceles involved in fantastics john does not feel that intent to see the one whose voice he had but but he turns to see the voice oh i like that he turned to see the voice the voice and the person are one and the same jesus is the words john chapter one one two three things and the beginning was the word and the word was report and the word if you can ever get to really see the words you will be seeing jesus the judgment is on june 10th he saw several golden candlesticks actually they were lampstands the churches possess a lasting quality and thanks [Music] what this is know my words then the answer is this is the word of the lord saying not by might not by power but my students save their notes meaning we can't do anything here i see we have the long stance where the canvas and the candles and the lampstands okay that's why you got the confusion yes okay so the issue is we have the candlesticks in the book of relation the bible calls them are you really sure are you really sure in the book of revelation the number calls them okay i did a series on this uh okay so um look at revelation chapter one um relation chapter one verses i think you can just be twenty are you tired no no no okay so vasquez says the mystery of the seven stars which that service in my right hand and the seven important candlesticks the seven stars are the engines of the seventh chart and the seven candlesticks which are serviced are okay so now the candlesticks here is what the bible calls it but then goes ahead and says well it's not really candlesticks it's lampstand because the candlesticks and lampstands are the same thing really okay the same thing in the perspective of what it does it gives light but it says if you want to see a clear picture of what this spirit is trying to project here go to the book of zechariah in zechariah that's the way it gives it up more clearly and he calls them lamp stands now those of us were in uganda may not know what a lampstand means or eats because we have not seen that much but in ethiopia they know them because many of them have been the orthodox churches and they use them even in catholic churches they use landscapes you know it is something like this with the culture here here's where it stands and then it has seven uh pipes like pipes where within it there is weak there is a weeks you know weeks and those weeks are the ones that stop are supposed to be suffering what are supposed to be sapping the oil so that the fire can be leaked on top of it so it is really supposed to be holding a light it is supposed to be meant to hold light but in there this last stand was in the right hand of him jesus christ the son of man then there was also what there was also stars now these stars are the seven angels the bible says messengers which means each star was going to each cut with to each lamp stand these seven lap stands made seven church churches they gentle seven charges of the same church of jesus christ okay yes quickly give me zachariah chapter four verse one to six seconds be able to identify this with you and be able to give you a clear picture to try to identify with their uh revelation zechariah four one to six uh here he says and the angel sorry is it no an angel that talked with me came again and walked with me as a man that went out of his sleep and say that to me come on and say that to me what that says now and i said i have looked and behold a candlestick or all of god with a bowel upon the top of it and he is seven lambs their own and seven pipes today seven lamps which are upon the top they are off and two olive trees by eight upon the right side of the barrel and upon the left side of the bow let me get a picture here of zechariah and be able as you keep that scripture there and i'll be able to show you what he is talking about okay just a moment and you see why you call them lampstands and what exactly it it means okay just give me a second i'll just get a picture for you okay so uh hopefully i will be able to demonstrate what i want to demonstrate okay okay can you put that one okay now these new series what does the scripture say can somebody please open it up quickly and read it and then you have talked with me came and again somebody wants you to help me are you there are you ready came again and what now this is the candlestick that is talking about here right here or what oh god okay it's a lampstand it's not a candlestick you know candle is the one that we know okay the modern candle but this is what it means by a candlestick okay it means a lampstand like this one okay continue you're gonna stick do you see the lamps yes you see the lamps right here yes okay and seven pipes the seven lamps seven pipes do you see the seven pipes coming out of the power going to the seven lamps which are upon the top there and two olive trees do all the trees you see them right there yes one upon upon the right side of the ball one on the right and the other upon the left side and the other on the left uh-huh now so i answered spark to the end to the angel that talked with me don't you know what these are come this is the word of the lord of allah but by my spirit hallelujah amen amen not my mind not my power but by my spirit and we see here he said i'm not that power not about my but by my spirit now the temple of the lord today is not the temple of solomon but it's it is you just said it's me you want a temple now you want the temple of what of the lord now let us go back here you saw this vision seven lap stands seven lamps on it then the two only trees that are bowed on top of it and then oh hallelujah it means god himself all right so we see one only three on the left another only three on the right one other three on the left symbolizing the old testament symbolizing the wrath of god that he has given through the prophets the bible says we are building the foundation of who the apostles are and the prophets the old testament prophets the ultimate messengers the old testament and then the new testament right so this is the jesus christ oh my my my man you look at this jesus christ is the one that the prophet spoke about the bible says so whatever prophets of the old testament ezekiel daniel mentioned them all of them off the bible says this is of whom all the prophets they speak about now the old testament is christ that's why brother bottom said if you read any fact in the bible you don't see jesus christ read again all right the only three the whole summit is the old tree uh sorry it's the only tree on the left the new testament is the only tree on the right on the right it is all the same thing it brings out the same trail remember all in the camera or the olive tree is meant to use to do what to light fire to bring forth light so when when he was bringing forth the prophets of the orchestra man he in other words they were coming to say bring forth life the preaching of our giving was a horrible speech it was my inspiration it was the fire and the power of god that attached them to bring forth that one the leaders comment apostles something is the same honor as fire it's the holy ghost and what and fire is the same word now when this word comes it doesn't come directly to what it doesn't come directly well come on now it hasn't come from the orange tree to the candlestick does it it doesn't why god is a god of honor he says true and the one god will do nothing but your word he will reveal his secrets to his servants he will do nothing the light will not shine what this candlestick needs in order to shine this light is the oil and when if there is no oil it means it will not work shine so it needs to receive the oil but the oil is not coming direct from the olive trees to the candlestick the oil is coming directly from the olive tree tower to where now to the power the bowel here i would say that it symbolizes it it symbolizes the uh the the the the the uh the spirit of god through the messengers as you would say and in every generation to to be able to bring forth the world of life today churches to their church ages the one comes from god comes on down to a prophet from the prophet is delivered to the church it has been so in the first chapter second chapter third fourth fifth until the seventh now when this one comes down the oil comes down from the bowel to where repetition comes to where from where the prophet from god to the prophet from regression 21 to regression 10 7 to revelation 10 8 to 11. what does the russian chain one say i come on now revelation 21 says what raise up your hands can you bring the bibles gifts i have for them give them the bibles i don't want to see anybody with a phone where is your bible where oh now we are going to take it from you and give it to another one okay so can you give those the bibles the purpose of this bible whenever we come here we have the bibles and we can be able to study with our bibles not with your forms so i can't understand if someone says they receive the bible and then i left that home it's quite not understandable and his face was as it was a sun and his feet as fillers of fire so this is the one that we read about already okay and we have been able to see who is he jesus it is jesus christ so say it [Music] of revelation 21 why is it jesus christ did you read about it so you've not finished the batman's vision so you never saw it but that's what we'll be talking about here the seventh glory of this of his passion okay look revelation 21 it is who jesus christ who is regression 27 what does it say but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin the mystery of god should be finished as he go up here oh no okay now i hope everybody's there okay one two three start when you shall begin the [Applause] [Music] okay so what does it say there yes verse 8. so who opened 5 the lamb yes now the lamb it comes here in the form of an angel a mighty angel who is the same jesus christ and after he brings down this open book he came with a little book open now the seventh angel sounding is the prophetic ministry on art of a man and we know that is barabana in our generation then now after a prophet comes with that message what happens we just begin right now watching the prophet no hallelujah the prophet goes out on the scene you know hallelujah so the oil comes from there all increased so let's say that the oil comes from revelation 10 1 the open mood all right the revelation of jesus christ it comes from revelation 10 1 then on it goes to right there it's a pretty picture it goes where do that to the candlesticks or whatever the lampstand what the lampstand the lampstand is the church is the bride god bless you hallelujah so the oil comes from the olive trees goes to the power and on them there's a lot of stuff so the oil comes from revelation to anyone who's jesus christ one down to the prophet that's the the the seventh angel's messenger on down to the bride he said that the things i do you shall do also the seven power of the holy tree amen the centre of jesus christ with the center of the prophet is the center of the bride the seven of those that they fade on they sell history they receive is the same that we must receive today you see now and also there's another thing that you are about to see here there how many candlesticks so the same one hallelujah that was in the first church age will be in the second [Applause] you see jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever so you see the seven holy spirit the same teachings that paul taught in the beginning is the same teachings we must teach today because [Applause] i think now you see it clearly you see that same holy ghost is still here you know we sing that song is the holy ghost on fire and it's keeping me alive it's keeping me alive is keeping me alive is the holy ghost on fire it's keeping me alive jesus is keeping me alive [Music] is the holy ghost on fire oh he's giving me a lot he is keeping me alive he is is he's all over me [Music] is [Applause] oh [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] we have today oh my so you can see why why john had to go to patmos because he had to see this revelation the same revelations that zechariah saw the same references that daniel saw you know god always even showing himself through his prophets praise the name of the lord and then have two more sisters and then i think i will speak a few things with rose all right sister rachel god bless [Music] if [Music] i come here do you mind elaborating more on that someone might wonder what you mean if you are this kind i keep okay which one did you read that from yes you so in other words you know we are all mixed up it doesn't matter we go back to you who is your mother who is your father we are all mixed up you cannot say this is the seed of god but the only thing that will show you who you are is the voice that you're following and if it's the voice of god then indeed you're gonna do it you'll recognize [Music] yes it was not feeling like it's right like it just has to scratch then push the turn when the mom came and said that you can't fly [Music] [Music] you see when mother eagle comes to the to the hand and the chicken and all the small ones that's danger that's what so when you are in your denomination or when you are among some people and then they tell you i don't believe those things that you ruin your life today it is danger but when you hear the sound you hear a sound which you kind of know isn't not the sound of my mama it's another song you know you are he's favors i'm not made like them you know you're made different you know you begin to realize you know late at first you were told that you were something you were told you were ahead you were told you were one of them you are told that soon enough you begin to realize no no hallelujah themselves under the thickest somewhere because they are trying to protect themselves from mother ego but mother ego knows you and you know them and you know you are not going to be endangered and as as she is calling you are answering as she's going you're responding as he's going you are even picking and picking up and all of a sudden you fly hallelujah my my i can hallelujah i wonder if you can say i can fly we need to hear that we are ignorant that's right we are not chickens we are ignorant yeah the chickens are the ones which scratch from the ground yes do you know the four living creatures what's the fascinating creature the first the first one lying that's what god said in the first generations right what was it symbolizing not only brethren but also not but also that they were purity right they are true to themselves i mean evil is always true to itself i mean i mean a liar okay number one then the second living question yes okay oh okay let me bring a picture also here about the four living creatures that's not the second one okay let me get it for you here our project is for you as well okay i'm not getting a good picture but i just predict the one i'm saying here before you just pick out what you want anyhow okay just give me a second i'll have it it's not a perfect one i would have wanted to project but it will do enough okay so i'm just getting before myself here okay do you see that yes they are not in order no problem the first the the first living creature to come was what a liar the second living creature to come was was [Music] and i'll show you to you later on how they came through generations the third living creature to come was what face of a man face of a man hallelujah and the last living creature to come was praise the name of the lord let me get a better picture here that i would that would depict the exact thing that i'm talking about i woke up i'm able to get it very fast for you so you can be blessed by it okay just give me a second here all right praise the lord okay just give me a moment i'll get it for you i don't know if you if i get a good resolution here i cannot find on my laptop but i'm going to try and get you the proper picture of okay this the one i'm looking for okay there you go okay that's the mess again okay can everybody see that do you see that now okay so uh i'll try to make this a bit bigger for you to be able to clear do you see the the line yes the lion came in that was the first living picture to come out revelation 4 7 and the lion was the anointing by all these four living creatures are the anointings of god that he powers out to human beings that are holding onto his word in the different generations over time so when we see the first church ephedras what powers out the first anointing which is the lion and this time they it symbolizes stands for purity and the power of the manifestation of the word of god at that time and god used saint paul as the messenger of that generation okay so you can see that very clearly now ephesians then comes mana pekomos and these three ages are the eight generations that were really uh which were persecuted because of their faith the faith they believed in and god gave them the anointing of a flying uh rather of a cow for the orcs now also represents the anointing spirit to sacrifice and to accept death you know rather than to accept doctrines of men they refuse to accept false doctrines and we you know remember that whenever the spirit of god comes down whenever the spirit of the devil comes in like a flood the spirit of jesus christ raises a lot a standard we see also the devil comes in with the anointings of the horse riders okay so the first horse rider was a white horse rider that was a deceiver coming into the first church aid to receive some denominations i feel like the sda speech that uh this was the jesus christ coming in you know kind of to conquer the world with righteousness but no because it is the white horse does not mean it is righteousness this is a deceiver because the prophet said he has a bow but he has no arrow so that's the devil the deceiver all right and uh then comes in the devil comes again of course when the devil came in as a deceiver you know through a white horse that the spirit of lord came upon the believers the devil came to deceive them the spirit of the campaign with the anointing of an ego uh we are not a meeting of a lion brother i'm [Applause] symbolize persecution you know the red horse rider has given the was given power to take peace from the earth he came in to kill he came in to destroy he came into possession we understand yes but the spirit of the lord through all these three churches amen he god began the believers they upon the believers of that generation do you know what the spirit of adults is yes to accept sacrifice rather than accepting we will not die we will stand for the truth regardless of what you do to us they gave themselves they would reap a woman is stomach and an adam gives a heart stomach wants to be ripped they will kill they will cut up their necks as if they are cutting off the necks of pigs they will kill them they will destroy them and persecute them but the more oh hallelujah the more they persecuted the church the more they are willing to give themselves to be persecuted can you imagine these people were as if they were bewitched but i'm glad they were wished by the power of the holy ghost hallelujah for the sake of the gospel you know when you are under the power of the holy ghost you are as if you are under a spell you don't care what nobody does to you you don't care what nobody does to you i preach this message i'm ready to die for it i tell you did you hear what i say i am ready and i'm not saying it because i don't believe it i believe i am ready to be imprisoned for it whatever they want to do they can't take it out of me the the faith i have they never never gave it to me so they never can't do one take it away so they they never could not take it away he persecuted them the more he persecuted the more they believed that was the second energy that got power down they never said oh okay you can also accept to die no problem no problem if you can accept that i will come again in another way the devil came in writing a black horse a black horse which imagines what framing fading of what not something of food and water the bible says saying it off the word of god so how in those generations during the days of martin luther with the wizarding 15 20 to around 1906 you know the devil was taken out you know that the people were refused to read the bibles they don't like to refuse people to ask to read their bibles not reading the bible it is only for the priest if you read it your whole entire house will be filled with blood and many things like that if you are found reading the bible interpreting the bible or translating it in another language you'll be killed the man who translated this bible into into the common man's language which at that time was english was burnt on the stake his name is william kinder and many others were were killed john wickliffe and many others i tell you this gospel is dripping with black that's why we see that that song is dripping with blood oh yes it is bleeping with blood the blood of the people who died for the truth what about you who just has to walk a little bit and you know what's going on and just overcome a few temptations really really should you play around with this gospel never believe this gospel if you're going to play with it believe it if you're ready to stand for it the devil came in to do that to bring confusion and bring feminine feminine nowhere no people you know this man would translate the bible send it to people and the catholic church would buy those bibles after they buy them they would take them and abandon them it is said that the catholic church was the biggest customer of william jr but they would buy to burn but it is saying that young children would take that same money which they have paid him to to to buy those bibles to produce more bibles hallelujah and notice that same god gave another anointing to overcome that he said ah you are going to overcome many people with they bring them the family no no problem i will also use the face of man i will use man this space of mine represents the anointing amen and the american spirit who is smart cunning to defend the word of god right william jenner was one of them there was jerusalem all right there was a a martin luther there was this many were intelligent they could reason with bishops and one of them was a priest actually why because they were anointed by god to do those things do you know why william kinder it is said that he knew how malaria it is german english even italian target and many other languages how can one man know all those languages it was the indirect that god had given them where is the law now the devil said hey you can be able to be smart and coming no problem i will they are attacking us all together correctly so it means that whatever spirit of god is going to give us must be a higher spirit a higher anointing and of course this anointing of this uh uh perhaps right there of course the devil is going to use all avenues all up your spirituality he's going to use the religions he's going to use the economy he's going to use that or you know the three things that they never used in the name of jesus he used the religious leaders the political influence and use the economy to persecute the one the church to persecute jesus to do the same thing today but you see one thing that god is going to do for us the devil we know he's going to try and want to control the world completely with the economy with it right now look we are on lock or down they say you can't do this you can't buy you can't do god he has given us the anointing of the flying evil evil the ego represents the highest anointing the spirit that we have received is the anointing is the highest revelation from god and brought out what does it bring out back to the faith which god uses during the church ages amen in our time in our generation wealth is using that even all through but we know we see today in our time right now he's using that of the flying uses even the politicians that use it but look because when you see in the scripture it belongs to us when you say in the scripture it is the last anointing that god says the anointing of the ego praise the name of the lord amen amen i thought i should share that sister god bless you so much for that amen praise the lord hallelujah before we finish up sister peace and brother isaac those two are contributed and then we shall close it [Music] the bible okay it says in acts 2 chapter 2 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit and just pass right on they shouldn't see it they don't see it if they certainly by getting the spirit they know that is regulations is amen can someone be baptized except they are prevented all right so uh here i want to ask a question is there someone here you know this or some people here that have been my place before the painting [Music] yes i don't want you to say no when you're singing for somebody i'll send them for you no okay all right you want to ask me then that means you are not baptized because if you have been baptized but you never believe fast is that baptism just like if i find a person there on the road and i'm like oh my friend come on let's go for what for baptism he says baptism i said yes and then he said what did you get for you praise me you will go to heaven okay let's go is that the opposite no you need to believe fast you need the mother did not say how old you should be no that's not the problem the problem is you must believe fast now can you believe unless you are what you have to hear who is who is speaking there you have to hear the gospel you have to believe the gospel then you confess it with your mouth then after that you get baptized in water and as the sisters say you should repent and you are pleasing the name of our lord jesus in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive a gift of there and just pass right some people just read and they pass or write on they don't say if they saw it by getting in the spirit they would know that if they want to receive the other girls they need to repent and be baptized in the name of their lord jesus and then what what will happen read with me god would be duty-bound to fulfill his wife by what so if you have believed and now you will not be baptized it's a very good opportunity for you right now right amen so how many have believed and i've never believed them before but right now they say now from what i've had really really in these meetings i have believed this message and now i want to give up your hallelujah uh uh somewhere here we have uh uh oh right there it's unfortunate oh stop oh god bless you then uh where else is there i don't see it oh situation is right there my my my mind and uh now why are you raising up your hand you want to be baptized yes why give me two reasons why you want to be baptized sorry because this told you how did they tell you oh did he tell you why okay now ask him why the day you know why you want to do that then we shall go baptizing so we have four is it for people four people one you got five i tell you four or five that's a wonderful thing amen we need to talk to the lord amen now uh can we have the last person to speak you all right can you put a camera right here so that he can also tell us what he learned and something that he'd like others to be blessed with most obviously they've shared it but also they shot most of the videos around so um [Music] [Music] um [Music] you see i think we have also discussed something like that which one are you reading [Music] um [Music] you will do better than both that you are going to do what god what jesus never did yes but he rather means you're going to do the things he did but in a multiplied way you're going to do more of it amen and so we see that uh actually how many did you just read from the day how many how many headed by the banana range from the day how many six my good lord how many five five people by the bottom of the day so you can see that in our generation you have had even a man raised more at a time so but that is not meant to say that is greater than jesus it was the promise of jesus more than one of them would work for faith hallelujah denominations which a man died cannot be born of god for it is the spirit not man that gives life and so we see that this word which we receive you can't fake it and like he said if you fake it surely you will manifest what you ask like uh when rain when the holocaust comes down and uh uh if it comes you know and kind of stick on you you know but those are weeds but when it when the rain comes down it feeds both the cocoa bars and also they look like the maize and the other syrians you understand so that the rain will not say ah i will only go to the maze also the coconuts same way but here is already what happens in the end everything we bring for the beads so whatever you have keep under the reign of the horrible skip under the world keep out of there the world is going to bring out who you are if you're a son of god then why will bring forth the best out of you amen you will grow and be nurtured in the knowledge of jesus christ and the power of his mind did you receive your bible and if indeed he received your bible were you blessed by it all right after that then do you have you been reading have you finished the practice vision can you unmute yourself so you can be able to speak to us we want to know what is it that you have read and uh we want to know uh how blessed it has been for you all right over to you uh sister jovanita god bless you all i received my bible and i'm very happy thank you pastor thank you all but i i finished doing the second chapter i i finished yesterday i mean now what part within the second chapter the fat most vision it really touched you and you would like you'd like to share with us yes pasta okay my question is what part did you read in the patmos vision that really touched you and you thought you should share it with us just like we have been doing here but it is on the questions it is on page 47 you say that the whole [Music] took charge of their lives they entered interest there is your arrest that is your sabbath it is not a death naraya but the eternity of being filled and blessed in the holy spirit it is seizing and god doing and god doing it is good in you willing and doing of his good pleasure for me on my side i was thinking that saturday was the sabbath and it is that the one god rested but when i read i i got to know that every that sunday and saturday all these days we can pray there's no any day that all those days asked but sunday and saturday that's all i can even i don't want to be baptized but for me on my side i am already baptized that soul god bless you so much for that yeah we are good place yes you say and i want to also re-emphasize on the on this point of the summer like we would rather share it if you missed that part you can find on youtube but like what i was sharing with the believers this matters well and we really were did have a good time on it now we also found out from this variable you see that saturday sunday neither of these is our sabbath our sabbath is the holy ghost is the holy spirit where you enter in and you are sealed away from all your works we also read in the book of galatians chapter 5 and we found out what our works are our works is not our day-to-day life our day-to-day things we do our work is the works of the flesh the scenes that so easily beset us those things is our work so we have to lay it aside and we enter into our rest which is christ the holy spirit then also the other thing we found out was that in the old testament they had a physical day which was saturday which was their summer but this was only a shovel a good shadow of the real sabbath which was to come by jesus christ now in the old testament they had their sabbath they had their their high priest who would enter into the earlier one is every year one time every year one time he kept on going into the holy bodies but with us we received our high priest which is jesus christ and he entered into the holy ghost one time one time everybody said one time one time he entered into the holy of holies one time and the moment he did that what happened with us we received the rest hallelujah also one time when he said rest how many times one time and so today we have rested from our rats the moment you are baptized you'll never follow up jesus christ you receive the forgiveness of sins you receive the holy cross when you receive all the ghosts you have entered your sabbath you can now say you are in the lord is that when the lord is you are in the spirit you are right god bless you so much everybody we've had a wonderful and productive day we have had five souls that are ready for baptism and also we have a uh apart from the soccer ready for baptism we've covered and it started quite much and i also understand there are many many questions here but you are going to forgive me it's already six because i wanted to go home i will not cover the questions i'm going to compile them with the others and on friday i'll try to let you do a little talking and i will do more talking on answering these questions as well as covering up the rest giving my comments on the on the on the path vision and i think we shall conclude that patmos vision on friday so the lord bless you so much and i would want to ask brother o'kello to pray for us across the world of prayer as we close our meeting for tonight and as we prepare ourselves for frankly please brother can you um [Music] and even in other ways that you just ask peacefully so much will come here we pray for our brothers who have come and made decisions signifying and then offered in the altar we still were washed with water as the baptism in water yes by immersion and then presented in the altar but still these substances had unwanted substances just sacrifices so they will be banned with fire that will produce goodness to you yes now lord jesus we pray that as the brothers go as they are repented so they have to repent of jesus because they have known you may they be washed in water and then offered in your altar to be baptized in the baptism of the holy spirit to burn our holy and what happens from the other side lord jesus we also pray for this service lord please continue with us thanks jesus praise the lord hallelujah he's a lot good the lord has been good all the time amen when we sing that song and can you give us the rewards of the song as we dismiss go father in the name of jesus christ together with my brothers and sisters here lord we believe in you as the healer of all our sicknesses our brother lord has a uh uh ailment in the body we uh lay our hands upon him with your father and apply the token of the blood of our lord jesus christ and i ask that you heal him you deliver him and be your father with your mighty hand and that he will leave this place when he's completely free set free for your name's glory and we command every power of sickness every part of saturn to flee from him in the name of jesus christ we are giving that such authority to go proclaim it in the name of our lord jesus father we thank you for healing him in the name of jesus christ where is the song brother god is [Music] [Applause] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] is
