Yeshua foreign at that time the Lord said unto Joshua make the sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time and Joshua made him sharp knives and circumcisation of Israel at the hill of our skin and this is the cause and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise that all the people that came out of Egypt that were a man that were male even all the men of War died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt now all these people that were that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt they them they had not circumcised for the chair of Israel walked 40 years in the wilderness till all the people that were Men of War which came out of Egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord and to whom the Lord swear that he would not show them the land which the Lord swear unto their father that he would give us a land that fought with milk and honey and verses 7 and the children whom he raised up in in their state then Joshua circumcised for they were circumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people that they bought that they Abode in their place in the camp till they were a whole and the Lord said and the Lord said unto Joshua this day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from all few where from off you wherever the name of the place is called gilgal unto this day amen Yeshua is foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] Matthew chapter 5 verses 29. 30 29 and 30. and if and if they write I offend they block it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that the whole body should be cast into hell and If thy right hand offended thee cut it off and cast it and cast it from thee and it comes from thee for it is profitable for thee that that one of thy members should perish and not that the whole body should be cast into hell is [Music] [Music] amen blessed Jesus Christ we thank you for this holy word we have read from your lips you are telling us you are giving us a simple advice that is better for us not to enter in heaven with one eye than to have both in Hell [Music] Lord Jesus I don't know which way to turn increase our faith hope each one of us pick something tonight in the name of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord yeah my sharing tonight my text uh I'm getting the title from The Book of Matthew where we have read and I'm going to call it it's time to cut it off blessed with the name of the Lord amen yeah if you see where we have read whatever already we know what we are supposed to cut it off don't chop off your brother's head amen Amina but you know what you owe to shop it off there are things that we have what do we need to get to dinner which are not necessary for us to have them in our lives and unless we cut it off we will never see God blessed be the name of the Lord because for these things God has put the power in our hands blessed me the name of the Lord and where we read in Joshua chapter five from verses these people who are on their channel to the promised lands and all of us Bible reader we know that every Jew must be circumcised and that was the Covenant which God gave Abraham foreign praise be to God Amen and here we are seeing some bunch of Brothers who are not circumcised remember where we have read the Bible says this was the generation which uh which was born in the wilderness out of the two million people which came out of Egypt it's only to whom it is and we know the reason as to why only two blessed be the name of the Lord because we're here where we are from reading the Bible says because they did not obey the voice of the Lord they perish in the wilderness and all of us who are born in the wilderness they are the one who married the promised land blessed be the name of the Lord and whether in the wilderness God was washing them he knew that this generation was not circumcised [Music] amen but God never destroyed them Musa [Applause] [Applause] God wants to destroy it was a must for them to be circumcision and Israel types the church you must be circumcised amen there is another circumcision going on today when the man was circumcised even the woman was counted on his mind blessed be the name of the Lord what is circumcision is the move is the removal of excess skin over Surplus tell me the name of the Lord and for them each one of them was supposed to be circumcised but today when it comes to spiritual circumcision when you receive the Holy Ghost it is the holy spirit which will remove that excess flesh praise the Lord you are moving with many things which God does not want from you and however much you want you cannot get rid of them and this generation was not circumcised then time for circumcision and do circumcise all of them and all of them were circumcised blessed be the name of the Lord and here the Bible says you have rolled away the reproach of Egypt out of from them [Music] amen Nina and they tell it until they healed that's necessary to cut it off now amen and the message Covenant confirmed the prophet said that and and and that is how the church is got to come so much like Christ and look what we do what we got to do then they cut away and circumcise and Shop off and form and molded into the image of Christ until that church and the and the cup comes right smacked together blessed with the name of the Lord in this Christian channel that we are in again every time we count for a service every time we dedicate ourselves we are chopping off some things amen we are growing into the statue of the perfect man and that's why every Christian must attend Fellowship every time you pray something happens in your life amen and God wants all those things to be shoved because the Bible says the bride has made herself ready if God wants will come and take this bad habit away from God will not now yeah foreign remember this Bible is there the red letter is Jesus word himself yes he did not say if your eyes he not say that uh if you are right I offended take it to the neighbor and he blocks it out for me but he said do it yourself amen Amina it is better you enter in heaven with one eye [Music] than to have two eyes bless every name of the Lord but remember this Paul is not going to inherit the kingdom of God you have another body amen if you plug this eye out to enter into the kingdom eyes you are going to be blind forever that's not right blessed in the name of the Lord so God told them he told Joshua circumcised them amen everybody was supposed to be circumcised ran away from circumcision you can never amen Amina they run away circumcision has never been a simple thing amen Amina and fun enough even if you run away and they will not go to police to report to them [Music] even when you have three stars here Nina [Music] [Applause] solo says the prophet Gamba amen you have not even started in the Christian Journey God has not even recognized your worship cartoon there no commissions that's why Jesus told Nicodemus you must be born again if you are to see the kingdom of God Amen Nina message Believers if you are to see the kingdom of God must be born again amen because a person is not filled with the Holy Ghost forget about Rapture video foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] In The Name Of The Lord amen but those who are going for the Rapture they purify themselves amen they cut it off the things of the world the pleasures of sins you know why you are called you have not cut it off but I'm here to tell you this evening now is the time to cut it off amen break that bridge behind you cross it and break it that was the beginning the first interest was gone and when I reached somewhere God knows how to do his work amen God had to cause commotion between our Lord is he handsmen and Abraham's head [Music] [Music] [Applause] blessed with the name of the Lord God knew what he was doing that's why the Bible says all things work together for God blessed with the name of the Lord if you don't want to cut it off God will make you cut it off foreign [Music] you come to the overnight you already satisfied satisfied [Music] and you forget [Music] but I know God knows how to do things that is breakfast is ready it's okay I will say that I will see when I'm back don't fire because you know you are on time everything is not working out and you realize you need God in your life blessed with the name of the Lord in the message desperation [Music] they wait until that time that is when they think of seeking God but brother sister amen pull those things aside my body the things of the world the pleasures of sins the girls of the world blessed be the name of the Lord amen and amen Amina he says better get your alarm trimmed yes it needs trimming arguments some lamps amen get lot of this world cut away from you and say no amen Nina unless we cut it off we are not going to see the move of God in our meetings many times the Holy Ghost comes find some of us we are still holding some things that we don't want to part with them but if all of us we cut it off all of us will lay aside Singapore not to be taken by all our weight all our sins the things we think they are so precious than the word of God and we come here with openly Hearts say that we have come with Open Hearts tell the word of God in part each one of us should open your heart is imparted in our souls come down oh brother sister it will be another Pentecost amen that's why the Bible says they were in one Accord foreign it was one Accord my brother we can be in one Accord until the song leader sings the song which is one of you has been singing in your mind amen until special song singers [Music] will have nothing to say when four of them ask for special song or six of them when three of them sing their specials oh that was the song I was going to say Amen we ought to be in one Accord we must be coming expecting something great from God but sometimes Believers come to Fellowship not even expecting a miracle from God Amen but every time you come nobody won't jump put a challenge before God today this mountain must be rolled away this question must be answered live when you prayed when you are praying blessed with the name of the Lord and when you come here the first step inside the church the song that will start with your songs foreign go through that when we lived up our house to Worship the Lord there is nothing standing between us and God okay why did she means let us allow the Holy Ghost to have Liberty in our meetings amen that when the Holy Spirit comes down he will strip the whole congregation he will slay this complications everybody will be drunk in the Lord the Bible says oh how I long to see that when a brother is blessed with the name of the Lord that is where we are heading to that's where God is preparing us amen the prophet says this message the bride will write another book of Acts that is not far it is if we can decide and walk with the Lord the Lord want us to write another book amen where Sinners will not hide where the holy spirit will call us out you better cut it off I wonder it was in a church when that says the Lord started when they call this one and the other one it has never been an easy experience [Music] but God does not want to assure us God has never been God's intention God wants us to line with the word amen because that is children's food when God comes in the Sandman that is our food brother when it comes in tongues interpretation that is the language we understand better that is our language when Miracle happens it is not a miracle to a Believers but the world is a miracle aliens but for us when we see that happening foreign the prophet never explained the word he manifested the Christ know anything that is demonstration of the Holy Ghost amen we also explain this word enough problem now is the time message this message speaks for his soul amen amen whatever we shall ask generation tonight is the name of the Lord the father will do it you will be manifested in his child and this thing is very simple things concerning faith we don't expect brother Isaac that is to pray for the sake I will show you today foreign foreign um in later days amen and that's why I remember one day the brother told us but the devil Satan even when uh when this is the shouting and what that does not move him [Music] but he said the day when they impossible amen man as long as you're a good message you believe a church member whoever will come remember where can you show me ah it's not even shaking you have message play I listen to message every day um whatever is just okay foreign foreign he puts conviction in our hearts we know for the world when we are right with God or not you know what hinders you oh man united from reaching where the Lord and most times like before it for another day for to be to be to be seen the camera now when I receive the Holy Spirit he will condemn me not to speak to that girlfriend when I enter in spirit how will they see me crying but let me tell you crying is everywhere if you don't cry for God you will cry for the devil if you don't shout for God in charge you will shout for the devil if you don't lift your hands for God in the church if you don't run for God in church you can understand this you have your dry eye in church or you better cry now blessed in the name of the Lord you see physical things they type spirituals [Music] one thing one good thing with Jesus Christ that when we love him even when we are we stress sometimes and you come back he still receives you fully foreign even gives you a nickname depending on the relationship you wear with him if all the time you were working together we can call you blessed in the name of the Lord and sometimes if you get their phones you will wonder the name they put on there I'm embarrassing you parrot and guinea flow number is all chocolates blessed in the name of the Lord Let Us carry it off Brothers now the
