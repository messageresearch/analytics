to be in his presence um I know you still standing that's okay you will see long time so God has given us a good week those who are not enjoying it I think you've not been anywhere around Believers the scripture tells us whatsoever they cus is that's where the e [Music] and so we have been gathered around Believers amen we've many of you have been in and I know God is blessing you those who are

you will be blessed I was there myself On th on Friday and then yesterday myself brother who else who else I think brother Josh brother who else yes brother Alan yeah right here and then brother and sister with all those we were inang we represented you well amen we had about 350 400 people there Samson is hosting a convention he invited and asked us to speak to services and it was a wonderful time shall we turn to our Bibles John 4:4 thank you musicians we are going to John 4:4 I love it when the musicians take the front seats yes that's beautiful instead of going way back there okay wonderful you know some some Churches after musicians play then they when the preachers is going to preach they they even leave the [Music] church and they keep checking online are they about to finish oh then I can now run and go and play I Believe musicians should also be actually in the presence or they should never even touch the musical you people need to support me by saying amen if you agree with what I just said amen John 4 ver we've read this many many times and I know that uh it um it can never become ordinary scripture is always new to us and he must needs go through Samaria this is about Jesus he left Judea and departed again into Galilee and he must need to go through Samaria then then cometh he to the city of Samaria which is called SAA near the pel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph and now Jacob's Well was there Jesus there being worried with his journey excuse me sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus said unto her give me to drink for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat then sayth the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew askest drink of me which am which I'm a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knowest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have been given the Living Water the woman said unto him sir thou Hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from when then hast thou that Living Water art thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle Jesus answered and said unto her whato whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up of springing up into everlasting life the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come thither to draw you [Music] for for for amen amen you may be seated please I'd like to first of all uh appreciate you and thank you for your consistence in giving towards the land [Music] fund uh God bless you so much we are making positive stries uh we are progressing as much as we we have had certain things to um a little bit decline our efforts like from the time of the moving to this place it kind of declined our efforts a bit and uh you know the making of the floor here uh the rent but nevertheless we are making positive eorts towards the land fund project and those of you who are streaming and following us online maybe you do not know but we are currently raising funds to buy our own church L and we have ways that actually you can give online uh brother those on the media they can be able to put [Music] that and you can also tell your friends you know you can give by mobile money we are actually working on getting M pay and air pay because um we we had another way to pay directly to the church account but it was stopped but if we have M it can also benefit us in our service collections because we are in a age where you find many people can come to church forgetting to bring cash on you realize ah I forgot to carry my offer but when you have it on your phone so M then just helps you you just see the code and then you just make so it will also help us on the land fund and the offerings going to we're trying to work on that with the treasury uh then also we have other ways of of sending donations like PayPal and Visa mile the Lord is good and we are going to attain this Vision it is not unattainable it is attainable if a church a small Church like this of the majority young people can raise this much money that you had and by the way most of it is raised in the past 12 months by the way so if we had started like this some two years ago we would have been very fun now someone when we started this weekly collections told me it is difficult people will give up so but you've proved them otherwise we have been consistent this is week I think 31 31 right and it is consistent amen for yourselves for that amen so uh and those who have not yet come on board you are you are making us to L behind please come on board and let us do this together it is always much better when we do something together it it works faster and then we are able to attain our goals faster also Sister Rose was in in what's the name of the place I what's yes that's the one but God gave her traveling mes and Amen brother Steven told me uh there's a Sister Irene that would come here today I don't know whether she's here yet is she not yet okay so with those few words maybe we can just go to the word now this morning I want I'd like to speak to you on the subject The Thirst quencher The Thirst quen tell your neighbor the th qu amen the quen now there is a natural thir that we are born with everybody here ask your neighbor you here yes of course they can be here physically but not here so as usual I request your undivided attention uh avoid moving out if you can for most of you adults I'm sure you can stay in one place for 1 hour 1 hour and a half so please stay in one place avoid movements because it disrupts the flow of the Holy Spirit I think we've been doing good for the past several weeks and we've seen God honor us with his presence when you hon the Holy Spirit he also honors you but if you dishonor him he's very timid he's very timid he just moves away [Music] and so do not grieve him do not grieve him when you are in a fellowship like this add on it don't take away if you do something that Grieves the spirit you are taking away even if you feel like you want to tell someone something it surely Can Wait It surely can wait until after the service is that an amen so there is a natural thirst that we are born with and every human being thirsts and we are all human being so we all thir and we are born to thir for God animals don't have a desire for God but humans uh or human beings desire God you have never seen animals making a statue or an idol to worship they have never built houses of worship there is no form of worship in [Applause] animals you know that is you know trying to actively worship something but man always wants to worship you know even if they don't know God you find that they trying to worship is humans that are building worship houses you know here in Africa we have heard like um uh in M where I grew up from for the past for the first 1 years of my life I know there is a tree called tree how many know and that tree is a large tree with Bess leaves Bess roots and so people believe that that tree was a a woman godess and and so she was moving and traversing the land and then she camped in that why because it is a a big large tree with big butress uh uh uh um you know uh branches or whatever it is so you can enter into it and you it appears as if you have entered a house and so you find many people entering there and they believe that whatever you pray there is answered and so they go with money they go with pipes they begin smoking there they begin you know doing their enchantments there and you know you find them there some of them it is as if they want to lose their mind but they're just basically worshiping a tree as a I don't know whether you are ready with those pictures by the so and so in the book of Jeremiah 10:2 the Bible says thus sayth the Lord learn not the way of the Heen and be not dismayed at the signs of Heaven for the Heen are dismayed at them for the customs of the people are vain for one cuts a tree out of the forest the work of the hands of the Workman with an axe they deck it with silver and with gold they fasten it with nails and with hammers that it move not they are upright as the palm tree but they speak not they must needs be born because they cannot go and so they have to carry it not afraid of them be not afraid of them for they cannot do evil neither also is it in them to do good you find in countries like um uh you know um India you know especially when they have floods you find these people you know very busy caring their gods on their back running you know they're trying to save their goats from the floods they trying to save their gods from the fires so we have heard those Gods also here in Africa amen I wish my sound quality can be improved we have too much noise and so we have had many of those gods in Africa and um also we have you know in India they have them in Europe they have them right now recently when they were starting um uh this how do they call it you know um somebody throw the the word to me the Olympics yes you know Christianity came from the East and went to the west and from the West it came here in Africa but we see now they are going back into their idolatries they going back into their ancient idolatry find now before the Olympics know the things they put there is just those gos the ancient Idols they've gone back again to them and it's what they are literally worshiping you know you have I have a few pictures for you here that I want you to see if you can just play those pictures you know many people have many gods that they worship this is um one of some of the Heathen Gods now you see this is um you know woried in China you know dragons they believe it's some kind of God and you know you find in America they have this goddess come on give me the next SC okay maybe they are not in order this is Buddha okay this is this is Buddha okay I I I'll speak looking at you then so this is America the goddess of America and then this is so this is the goddess of America okay just if can you follow my pets okay yeah continue on continue on just keep them playing it's all right and then this is I think somewhere in China China somewhere in China you know this is z these are just Idols this is some go in in in ch in um in in India this is Buddha laughing oh give us that picture again and this is someone who God you know Buddha and you know they have those pictures and the sculptors and the images and the idols go back go back a little bit yes this is uh you remember how it was in the in in Egypt when they when they left Egypt the of isra free that you know and and Moses was up in the mountain you know the children of Israel they decid they kind of because Moses was not coming and they felt like they had a thirst for worshiping and so what they did they decided to collect whatever gold they had they removed all the earrings they removed all the nose Jewels they removed all the the the bracelets the Rings and whatever more they had and all the gold was brought together and they molten or they made they melted this molten C and they kind of felt now they wanted to appease that F they had their because you see they wanted to worship and so they began now they put it up there oh everybody was happy they began dancing now we have our go this car imagine people who had heard the voice of God but you see because they did not see God because they had not found that God and you know even the Bible tells us even when they went to the promised land they still did not find the rest for their soul their first was not yet qued there was still someone else that was to come that would quench their thoughts and that is Jesus and so they began worshiping come on and so we have many others you know the the the the Indians I think this is IND and and you know it's just some kind of funny looking you know mold but they kind of believe that that is their God if they had me talk about it that way they would say you blaspheming our God but you see this is just an idol continue on this is z the ancient god of Greek of the Greeks it's just an idol continue on yeah yeah just let it play Let It play give us more of that yes this is China somewhere they have many gods in China many gods in China continue yeah you remember this image of Nebuchadnezzar you know how he put it up there you know it was having a message speaking of what God would do talking about the gentle kingdoms out of the dream he had but the man decided to make an image out of it and he told everybody to bow to it but only three refused to Bow that's why the Bible says learn not the way of the Heathen we may be in the world where you know we we are surrounded by heavens and everybody is worshiping certain things everybody is worshiping certain Spirits everybody is worshiping certain images and Idol but we should be like these three brothers we will not we should not bow we should not B because for us we have only one God and his name is Jesus Christ that is the only God we shall worship that is the only God We Shall Serve amen the Bible told us not to learn the way of the Heen all right so he was you know why does man do all these things because man was made a living Soul he has always desired to know the Creator man has always looked for ways to enjoy life to its fullest you always feel like you want to enjoy life you want to fly you want to go higher you know you want to enjoy you want to discover life and you know it's it's a thirst that God has placed within our heart each of us have it in the message in for life and I would read many quotes out of that the prophet would say and as I stood back you know he had come from preaching and he was very tired and so he you know was retiring to go in a hotel room and rest and so now he narrates what he saw what he experienced there at that hotel and and you know many of us like you know preachers that travel we see a lot of these things we are really living in this kind of world where are many people are worshiping Idols other gods spirits and we are surrounded by them but we should never allow the world to influence us into worshiping the gods they worship the Bible says we are royal priesthood a holy nation we should be different because we are made to be different because we have found the one that can quench our thoughts and soam narrates and he says you listen to this story he says and as I stood back in the shadow they were most you know these people were coming running up and down they were most too drunk they were so they were too drunk to recognize me standing there they came by lovely looking women and men pulling them to the rooms and the other men fasting about them I noticed as one passed by she stopped and she taken a big drink from the bottle you know as they were just moving around and you know they were carrying on as usual so she stopped and pulled a drink and took a big seep a woman and handed it over to the other one and and and they made some kind of a real dirty smarty remark and she said [Music] who this is you know I don't know whether some of you have been there but those people who are there they think that is life they think they have joy they think they happy but you see this oh my God these people are thirsty listen listen to what the prophet of God says about this and so she said o this is life I thought how mistaken you already that is death the Bible say the woman that lives in pleasure is dead while she ising how the devil has made people believe that that was like some people think they smoking gambling drinking reveiling his life by the way I was just trying to look up the meaning of the word reveiling or ring I don't know if that's the right pronunciation and listen to what it means because the Bible also speaks of it it means to celebrate to enjoy the action of participating in Lively and noisy festivities especially involving drinking and dancing you know those kind of things that make people excited you know enjoying they think they're enjoying they are celebrating that's why you never find people drinking alcohol having a party when they are sad they think they're so happy and so they are always shouting and all Party enjy come on God come on begin drinking they sh oh you want some that's Ring says that is death a perverted life it is not life it cannot be life that kind of a life becomes so miserable to many times people take a gun or something and read themselves of that life so that could not be the kind of life that the psalmist was speaking of when he was saying that loving kindness is better than life to me but this is not the kind of life that David was speaking about but this is the kind of Life the world is offering our younger generation and they think it is life but it is not life my brother it is death because in the end they end up becoming depressed they end up becoming so sad they end up getting a hangover and they go into drugs and they begin they many of them shoot themselves and take themselves out of that kind of life and they go straight to hell and says and I thought then what makes people do that how come that men and women will do those things then I thought this God created man to thirst for life these people do these things because they're thirsting for life can you imagine a prophet would tell us these people are doing these things because they're thirsting for life and any of you before you get life you can actually also have these thir that thir that is in you is a creation of God you see you find these women pulling these men pulling them into their rooms living in immorality thinking and part and think they enjoying life smoking and gambling you know why do they have these Appetit it is because they have a thirst a thirst for life but they've not yet been quenched they still have that s and they will have it until they find the amen the th quen and so the prophet said why do they do that how come that men and women will do these things then I S this God created man to thirst for life that that is in you is a creation of God tell your neighbor that th is the creation of God and right and wrong is said before for you as a tree of life and death in the garden of aen and God Made You to thirst and how dare you take that blessed thirst that God has put in you thir after him and you try to quench it with the things of the world the devil is trying to make men and women run run the night clubs they are running the night clubs parties and live immorally because they are thirsting and that thirst is in you is of god and it will never be satisfied until Christ that Fountain the fountain of Life fills your soul until you receive him by the way of the Holy Spirit your thir will never be it is totally impossible the devil will make you believe that you are living but you are dead in sin and in trespasses God is the only thirster that will satisfy that longing in you I told you there's a time I I I I had a thirst I didn't even know I was a child and made for myself a cigarette and I put fire on it and I started you know smoking it and you know it's the closest I ever came to smoking I began coughing and coughing and coughing and then I realized the thing was not good but you see that thirst what made me smoke that paper it was because I had a f in me I did not know who would quench that fast but when I Found Jesus amen the when I found him the Fountain of Life he quenched my thirst in my soul you can't give me a cigarette now because I don't have a thir for it there is no one that will quench your thirst and everything you are doing can't quench your thirst until you find him Christ the Fountain of Life last night he says when I was going into the hotel I know this two nice young ladies as wife and I were walking in beautiful young girl somebody's daring some mother and father maybe maybe little old dad had sweated hard to feed them and they were dressed very and as they went into the door they entered to the right to a little bar dingy [Music] dark with cigarette smoke and whisky fumes coming from that I thought oh you walking into the Jo of hell into the Jo of death you may defer with me you may say that's just an old F and I've seen also many young people who when you tell them these things they tell you you just from another generation they don't even realize it is not about the generation you are coming from it's about the S you have theen of matter which generation people have been thirsting from the very beginning years and years before you were Bor but each person that found the thiren was satisfied and they never went back again into those things and so you might say well you are just an old foggy but my friend in the end of this life you find out that that is the truth it is death to enter into that it is death to enter into that bur to go into and begin taking whiskey it is D to begin taking cigarettes it is you are trying to satisfy a hunger you are trying to satisfy a thirst with the things of the world and thus th was not was not given to you to be quenched by the things of the world it was given to you by God to be satisfied and quenched by Christ the inexhaustable Fountain of Life when you try to satisfy that with with with that perverted tomorrow you wake up with a headache with a heart and you live immorally you've got to face the world with a scar on you for the rest of your life you only get death by doing so by trying something else out of Christ y that craving in your heart you will only get death and the prophet says let me invite you to a fountain that's open in the house of God a smitten rock that lifegiving water came out of it Jesus invites everyone he says whoever will come let him come and quench their fast they will never fast again what a promise that is sometimes we have a religious th you know you end up with as much hypocrisy in your life sometimes worse than even going to the barroom you are in church people sometimes will come so close to the Fountain they will be in church in a message church but they will refuse to drink from that F right in the middle of God changing lives people will come up give testimonies I was an immortal person God changed my life I was a drunk God Chang my life was lustful God changed my life but right in the middle of God doing this things people will sit right there and they will refuse to drink from that Fountain when God is very busy doing wonders and the Miracles right under the fountain and they die and rot we have many of those in our churches in church that's why even the people of the world sometimes they would tell you I am better off an [Music] unbeliever than being a hypocrite because they have thought that every Church person is a hypocrite but I tell you brother not every Church person is a hypocrite if you a hypocrite don't think everybody is you are a hypocrite because you couldn't or you have refused to drink from that but whoever drinks from that Fountain God changes them and he quenches that fast for the things of the world that they used to do in a message how can I overcome he says I was crossing an Old Log the other day down I wash or what is called a hollow and I jumped up on this log on the outside it looked good it looked like a big old beach log but when I jumped on it oh a great chunk of it fell off it was real rotten and dirty I say that's the way the Christians are becoming they've been dead in sin and trespasses so long till they become dirty dirty means to be socked and soft and [Music] spongy yes yes that's the right they can hold no weight at all they don't know what what even overcoming means I begin to think of this text then overcome keep life in you when life went out that's what brought that log to that condition and it made it so worse than ever when it laid in the branch where the water was [Music] and then there you take a Christian that is supposed to be a Christian let the life of God go from him and the experience the joy of serving Christ and living in a church where such is going on he Rens twice as quick living in the church but what happens because that Joy of serving Christ that experience has left them the life is no longer in but they in church but they will R fast than even the ones who are in the B so if we are trying to follow the message of the hour or at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the Life of Christ because if you don't you lay around and know that these things that you are supposed to do and you don't do it the Bible said he that knoweth to do good and do it not to him it is sin then you become dirty you become rotten when you are separated from the life of God so you strive with all that is in you to stay in the Life of Christ every one of us should strive with everything in us with everything in us to live in the Life of Christ whatever the word says within your soul that you may be fit bearing in John 46 the Bible says Jacob's Well was there Jesus being worried with his journey sat on the well and it was about the 60th house there come a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus said unto her give me to drink Jesus engages this woman in a conversation he wants to engage you in a conversation this morning all the other men that she had met they had engaged her in a conversation for the wrong reasons and the reasons they had in was to perpetuate that fast that was in her to try and pet it to try and satisfy and gratify but Jesus the thiren was the only man who could offer her something something that could qu that once and for [Music] all verse 10 says Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knowest the gift of God and who it is that sayth to thee give me to drink thou would would have asked of him and he would have given the Living Water Jesus told this woman you just don't know who he's talking to but if you knew who he was you would have asked him give me to drink if you knew who you were talking to whenever you come in [Music] church oh if you could only come to the house of God and we realize who is here if you could only realize for just one moment who is talking to us who is trying to reveal himself as he ascended up on high and he sent gifts to men Amen to the Earth men on Earth and he equipped those men that those men pastors preachers prophets teachers those men could come equipped by the power of God and they would come under the anointing and they can become the voice of God to you to bring you a message which will Design Your Heart which will reveal your needs many times you come and say Pastor you talking about me it wasn't me friends it was the Messiah the first quen who was designing your life and revealing your life because he has anointed me to come and talk about what you are going through like that woman at the so that her heart can be designed and and then at the end of the service for her to realize Jes told her if only you could know who is he that is speaking to you if you could only recognize it is him Among Us and you could know the gift of God then you would say like that woman would oh God give me a drink let me get something that will quench this down inside of me but what we do we don't do that and matter of fact I would tell you how do you know God is speaking to you in a service if what the preacher is talking about is about your life then you know the first has passed your way oh hallelujah hallelujah when he passed the way of this woman he didn't come to leave her the way she was he had come to quench her thirst if only she could drink from the water Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again you drink the from The Thirst of the denomination you drink from the thir of those addictions she was drinking from The Thirst of adultery you know drinking from The Thirst of the lust of the eyes and Bre of Life them carrying on that we see in the world you know you would again but whoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thir again but the water that I shall give him shall be in him shall be in me in my soul in my heart a well of water springing up into everlasting life this is what God wants to give you brother this is what God wants to give you my sister he wants to give you a well a well within you amen one that is satisfying everywhere you go everywhere you live you might be at school you might be on the road you might be at home you might be somewhere work know where I believer is anywhere that well will be in you you might be at school that well oh Hall you don't need to come in church for that well to be there the moment you receive it wherever you are he keeps you he satisfies you amen that Holy Spirit is on the inside of you what is it what is this well of water it is the holy spirit amen it will be inside of you bubbling up washing all the wild away from you washing all the trash away from washing every stain of s washing every desire giving you the quenching water taking away that desire that thirst for the things of the world Amen it will be a satisfying a satisfying portion the woman said unto him sir give me this water oh God give me this water I wonder how many can say that today that I thir not neither come to draw the woman after her being designed she realized she needed what this man had Jesus began to work on her problem Hallelujah when she opened up in her heart Jesus began to work on her problem but the problem many of you people you don't open up when he designs your life you just cover up say I don't need it I don't want to drink from this water I won't have it and when you do that you remain the where you are and then you become a hypocrite you rot even much worse you stay in church but you living in sin because you are the you have no whe of water why because you refuse to drink you came right at the fountain but you would refuse it and remain in fornication and remain in the seat and you remain in adultery you remain as living a Rowdy life a drunked smoker using drugs you said pastor we are believers why are you saying those things let me tell you it doesn't matter what you know if you don't have this whe of water in you I know these things will be there and that's why we have them in church not only this church many churches where they rot to the C it doesn't matter who you are you may be even a pastor or a preacher if you don't have this ho if you do not have this Fountain you will be rotten and this woman after being designed said sir give me this water that I thir not neither come to Hallelujah Jesus began to work on her he began not to look deeper into her soul and find where the thirst Jesus said unto her go call me your husband it sounded random because she had opened her heart Jesus went straight to where the problem was he says call your husband and come here the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou hased well I have no husband has five husbands and he whom thou Hast now is not your husband in that thou say This truly so Jesus goes right to her problem her problem was this she was thirsty but she had tried one man after another one man he didn't satisfy so she tried another one he didn't satisfy her she tried another one then she tried another one and another one until her life was so scar scar she was so disgraced she was so asham she was in this condition because she was thir imagine she was in that condition because she was you know what the devil didn't know about this woman hallelujah hallelujah the devil did not know that she was a predestinated seed of and that seed in her was calling for expression was calling for expression every time it would go the devil would hand her another man but it wouldn't satisfy her and neither will the world neither will sin and evil satisfy you my brother it can never satisfy because you are a PR destinated seed of there is a longing in your heart that can only be satisfied by God she had even tried religion it couldn't satisfy you say I have tried to go to church I am i' paid my tith my brother I'm a good believer I attend DV I'm a good sister but it has not worked for me I'm still thirsty I'm still you know one person asked a question during our youth service can you be filled with the Holy Ghost and have those dark Addictions on you no if you are still a prisoner of addictions you don't have the go and so you are in church and you are still under those addictions and you're saying but I've tried everything but I'm still thir why the answer is that is because you did not drink you can lead a horse to the water but you cannot make him drink hallelujah hallelujah what good is it to have the fountains moving and you know Ministry preaching and bounding the word you come here Wednesday you come here Friday you come here Sunday word after word preaching after preaching and then you're not changed what good is it there is a b in Gilead that's why the ministry say there is a Healer here there is aiver there is a deliverer in our but you won't take the medicine you have refused you won't drink the water then he began to deal with her first here is what you have you have been doing you have been trying to satisfy that Godly and what you tried hasn't helped you or satisfied [Music] you you have had five husbands and the one you are living with is not you have tried religion and you are thinking you know something you know it's some form of you know thing that can help you I try this and you know turn a new Lea for many of you say I'll make a promise I'll be a good it has not worked that is not what you need you need the he had first he tried satisfied with money even money can't satisfy there's only one thing that will work my sisters and brothers that is to repent and come to the repent turn come to the Fountain there is a fountain in the House of David if I were you or you or you I would plunge push everything I had within me I would run I would immer myself into this Fountain Hallelujah tting for life he says the first test that she got of that when recognized him and confessed him to be the Messiah he told her she was living an adult she said thou must be a prophet and we know when the Messiah cometh he will tell us this things and Jesus looked at her and said I am he that speaks to you I wonder how many would be able to receive that she dropped her old water pot she had tested something so much better Hallelujah when you oh glory to God when you test of the Holy Spirit friends you realize it tastes so much better so much better than betting so much better than gambling so much better than pornography so much better than fornication so much better than perversion and immorality so much better than deception so much better than witchcraft than hatred than malice than anger much better than all the revealings and the things of the world the problem we don't want to drink but sister my brother you can drink when you drink of this and you taste of it whatever you had you realize it's nothing she threw her water pot everything I have everything I ever was I want to throw it down tell him Lord you can quench my thirst you throw it down in his presence she dropped her old water pot she run into the city with a message on her heart come see a man hallelujah hallelujah come see a man who has told me everything I did and many times you come in the church and he tells you everything you did and you refuse to drink and you walk away and you come again and you walk away but in the process you become worse and worse you become more rotten you don't have to do that friends because you can drink from this world it says if you've never tested nothing the water from Jacob's cold former well been only testing that cold for well you come to the Messiah I wonder how many are willing to come come to that Fountain of Life it will be different from then on it is life it gives you the hope that nothing else can is the only way of life I'd like each of us to [Music] stand Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah did he design your life did he speak of your situation now I have a question

but I would have disobeyed the Holy Spirit you are struggling you're trying this and that you want to be good for sure you really deserve but you're locked up whenever you try and you make a vow and you make a promise I'll be good I'll try my best become wise because you're not drinking from this well of water what is it it is the holy spirit he says whomsoever I give it will never thir it is him who gives it to you he wants to give you his life the baptism of the Holy Spirit doesn't matter your fast leave leave that alone he designed your life now are you willing to open your heart and say Lord I thirst I've tried almost everything but I failed but I'm here in your presence Lord Jesus give me to drink give me to drink is that all it takes yes that's all it takes takes you to repent of
