[2:39:14] this is the warning of the Holy Ghost to
[2:39:16] each one of us never cross the
[2:39:20] separating
[2:39:22] line Lord give us the
[2:39:28] grace it may be from tonight on that you
[2:39:32] will turn down the message of God for
[2:39:35] the last time then you'll be in that
[2:39:38] sight of God marked off in
[2:39:42] apostasy there is only there is only
[2:39:46] only going to be two glasses of people
[2:39:48] in the last days of which we are in the
[2:39:51] last days because we have received
[2:39:54] Malachi 4 the sign that we are in the
[2:39:56] last days the mark of God is the B of
[2:40:00] the Holy Spirit without without a Shadow
[2:40:04] of Doubt I have preached that not long
[2:40:07] ago right here by the Holy Spirit help
[2:40:11] and the word of God provided it that the
[2:40:14] Seal of God is the baptism of the Holy
[2:40:16] Ghost
[2:40:19] without the Holy Spirit you are not
[2:40:22] sealed but the holy spirit is God's
[2:40:26] seal and then that all that was not
[2:40:29] sealed by the Holy Spirit was uh was
[2:40:33] okay they took on the mark of the beast
[2:40:36] and the mark of the beast is the mark of
[2:40:38] apostasy which is the which is the the
[2:40:41] the which is rejecting the Holy
[2:40:45] Spirit what is the holy spirit the word
[2:40:49] you reject the word you reject the holy
[2:40:52] spirit amen and he said that is the mark
[2:40:56] of Apostles rejecting the Holy
[2:40:59] Spirit the word not only in written form
[2:41:03] amen but the Bible says when the spirit
[2:41:06] that raise Christ from the dwelleth in
[2:41:07] us he Quicken our mortal bodies we shall
[2:41:11] not struggle with things when that
[2:41:13] Spirit comes and dwell in our
[2:41:18] soul blessed be the name of the
[2:41:21] Lord but you see then when the Year of
[2:41:24] Jubilee all the blast comes and the

[2:41:44] type of the Old Testament that is the
[2:41:46] type and the shadow of the new to reject
[2:41:50] Christ and to turn him down that he that
[2:41:54] he's kicked at your door you are on
[2:41:57] Danger on a danger life of being
[2:42:02] bored bored the ear faith comes by

[2:43:24] terrible
[2:43:26] thing you will just be a message
[2:43:28] believer putting on long dresses and

[2:44:06] time while the Jubilee time while the
[2:44:09] doors are still open do you realize that
[2:44:12] the same B of the Holy Ghost have been
[2:44:15] oh
[2:44:16] Hallelujah the same B of the Holy ghost

[2:44:30] seal me Lord help me Lord Hold Me Lord
[2:44:36] forgive me
[2:44:42] Lord the first thing I had to do with
[2:44:45] Divine gift was within the heart of the
[2:44:47] people the B of the Holy Spirit fell the
[2:44:52] first time since Pentecost in Russia so
[2:44:55] it tells us what happened in Russia they
[2:44:57] turned down the Holy Spirit and they
[2:45:00] were sealed to Doom they Embrace
[2:45:02] communist up to
[2:45:04] today says the prophet in this
[2:45:10] message if you want listen to God he
[2:45:13] will give you over to to Spirit that
[2:45:16] condemns
