Gareth from Zimbabwe brother juston asked me to speak I said we have this young man going to minister for us this evening he said he should also come and Minister for [Music] us I just invite you right away our clock is [Applause] ticking God bless you amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord your amens are important to me because the way that you respond to the preaching of the word is what says the tone of the service you me down I'll will just remain down but if we are about to fly make sure that your seat belts are fastened because the destinations is in Heavenly places not the First Dimension not the second dimension we are headed straight for the seventh dimmension right to the throne of God hallelujah so if I say Amen you better respond to the word or else you might miss it Hallelujah I want to thank the pastor for the opportunity that he has given me and also the Saints of evening light it's such a blessing to be standing before you I always and usually say that it's not hard to preach to a message believer because the message believer knows exactly what you're talking about so if you make a simple mistake don't worry they will be in your inbox in the evening they're telling you brother you misquoted the scripture there brother you misquoted the prophet when he was say hallelujah but we believe that the Lord will give us Grace and the Lord will anoint our lips without further wasting your time let us open in the book of Exodus 12:7 Exodus the book of Exodus 12:7 chter 12: 11 how many know that we are in an exodus we are right in the Third Exodus coming out of denominationalism getting into the word of the hour coming out of the ludan church age getting into the bright age praise God hallelujah hallelujah praise God hallelujah now the Bible says in the book of Exodus 12:7 and they shall take the of the blood and strike it on the same uh they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two sides of the post and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it after that we go to the Book of Leviticus The Book of Leviticus chapter 7 verse 24 verse 27 26 to 27 lus chapter 7 Leviticus The Book of Leviticus chapter 7 vers 26 to 27 it says here moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood whether it be of foul or of beasts in any of the in any of your dwellings whatsoever Soul it be that eateth any manner of blood even that Soul shall be cut off from his people hallelujah then we go to the book of Hebrews chapter 9 Hebrews chapter 9:22 it says here and almost all things are by the law preed with blood and without the shedding of blood is no remission of sins again in the book of Hebrews 12 verse 24 it says here and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel Hallelujah let us close our eyes and just commit the word of the Lord precious gracious Heavenly Father come th presence thank you for the anointing and the opportunity I am just but an unpr profitable servant I know not the right words to say or to speak to your people but you have the food already stored in your storehouses may you just help your humble servant in hiding behind the cross may never be seen but that you speak to your children may this word Heavenly Father bring about the breaking of all the chains and ask to return back to the fellowship in the mighty name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray hallelujah praise God you may be seated now we have read here a portion of scripture in the book of Exodus 12:7 when God spake unto the prophet Moses and told the prophet that you shall kill an a lamp without spot or blemish a lamp without wrinkle now our Prophet when he comes to the sin he explains to us that the Old Testament is just by The Shadow a shadow of the things that were to be it was all pointing to the Lord Jesus Christ why when you read the Bible you do not see the Lord Jesus Christ go back and read it again now we all know that Christ was the Lamb of God the one was without SP or wrink the one without blemish he was the one that was being represented by this lamb that was being spoken here as you better reading the scripture in verse in verse 7 here you hear the Lord was telling Moses that when you shall kill that lamb before you eat it Thou shalt take off the blood and you you you sprinkle it on the post of the door on the lanter you see now this is just but a representation of the Cross because you have something like this and another another sprink of blood which is vertical and another one is diagonal that just brings about the cross it was all pointing back to the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah praise God now there is something that is important about the blood in the Bible the blood is spoken of 392 times and we only have 66 books in the Bible which is enough for the blood to be spoken twice in every book it shows you the importance of the blood now when you read further in the book of levius the Lord is giving an a direct to the people that you are not supposed to consume of any blood any animal now my question is why are we not supposed to consume the blood the prophet tells us that in the blood that is where the Gin of life is for the blood of every animal is the life of every animal the the blood that is in you is the life that is in you praise God hallelujah now even science sence science tells you that in your blood is where the DNA is found what is the DNA the DNA is the blueprint or it is the recipe of the composition of your body in that DNA is a peculiar fingerprint that is different from each and every person God does not duplicate a DNA your blood is different somehow from the person next to you because is the blueprint of who you are also discovered that what causes these diseases to be hereditary because there is something that is in the blood hallah the Bible tells us that Levi paid tithe in the Lo of Abraham did that get transferred to him it was an issue of the blood that's why generational Spirits from where you come from are able to you not because you in Uganda because even if you travel to the United States of America those Spirits would still find why because they follow a certain pattern they follow a certain fingerprint that is found in the blood Hallelujah so the matter of the blood is very important the Bible in the prophet tells us that the devil hates the Book of Genesis why does he hate the Book of Genesis it is the where are the Gen found are found in the blood that is where all things started and originated from in the Book of Genesis that is why whenever I get an opportunity to preach I try to bring my message all the way back to Genesis because that's the beginning of all things Hallelujah now in Genesis you realize and you find out that when when Eve was beged by the fell to sin not being deceived CH to partake of the same sin hallelujah praise godu when he fell into sin God did not come down God was not bothered because he fall but God was bothered when fell into s why because the G the Propet explains to us hallelujah in the message God perfecting his church that the sh of life is found in the male SE is found in the saw the losing of Abraham Adam when he lost his position brought all the blood of humanity and it was stained why the very moment that Adam of the had to come down right there to make a way because he knew that if he would not make a way all atace was going to be lost because the DNA was in the the same way if I P TI in the of Abraham the same way you and I to sin when we were in the Lo of Hallelujah praise God hallelujah are you following me tonight Hallelujah do not miss this because it is important now that is why when we go down further in the Book of Genesis a prophet AB under the anointing knew that this was not a matter of anything else but because it took the blood to throw into being lost it was going to take the blood to bring men back that is why by that same Revelation AB had to offer a lamp of sacrifice pointing again back to the cross of calvary it was a revelation it was not in Beauty so as thought Hallelujah this message of the hour is dripping with blood it is a matter of the blood it's the blood that th that th being lost it is the blood that will bring them back hallelujah praise God hallelujah how many believe and are grateful for the blood the blood that was shed upon the cross of Calvary my I want to tell you that is why we apply the blood what is the blood the blood is the token the prophet goes on to explain as we shall find out in the potations that in that blood God chose to Veil himself in what is called a blood cell because when the prophecy came that a virgin shall conceive the prophet at one time thought that it was an egg God created in evil then he came back and said no it was not an egg but because it were an egg it would have something to do with a woman but God did not want anything to do with a woman that is why he took a blood cell and failed himself the life of God in that blood cell and put blood cell in the woman Mary and that blood cell because it had a life in it it was going to bring forth life because the law of life that life bring forth its own kind now the life that was right there was not the life of Mary was not the life of a Jew nor was it the life of a gentile but it was the life of God himself it was the set o e o n o e z o e the Zoe life of God hallelujah praise God now the blood of Jesus Christ was not of a Jew of a gentile hallelujah praise God so what brought us back into Fellowship was not the blood of a man that is why we read in the book of Hebrews that there is a blood that speaketh better things than the blood of Abel hallelujah hallelujah I did not know that the blood voice the blood speaks because when God whenw God came to Kan and said I hear the blood of your young brother it is calling out to me so there is something that is important there is something that is mysterious that is hidden in the blood hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah that is why my precious brother you cannot have life without the blood there are three things that are there present before life is there is there is the water which is why we are baptized by water there is the blood and after the blood there comes out alive so it is the blood of Jesus Christ that brings about New Birth hallelujah praise God hallelujah that's why you see when Abraham after he took Isaac up the mountain and was about to kill him and God said no stop because it was never a matter of anybody else's blood the blood of the Lamb when God St Abraham anded him to a that c in the ticket hallelujah hallelujah and he took that lamb and he offered it for a sacrifice right after doing that came down to Abra and said Abraham I've seen that you love me and you have not withheld thy son from me and because of this Blood I am now giving you an unconditional Covenant hallelujah praise God that is why without dis spilling of blood there is no remission of sin the blood is what activates the Covenant hallelujah praise God now because you have the blood of Christ in you the Covenant of God and man is forever present and is forever alive and it is hidden in you hallelujah praise God what happened when men what happens when men is born again there is a blood transfusion your blood is done away with and the blood of Christ is what gets in you in other words there is no Spirit from your generation of fathers that can trace after you because what is in you is not your blood but it is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah that is why cancer there no power because it is not your blood but it is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and the blood of the Lamb shall never lose its power the blood of Jesus shall never shall never his power oh praise God I'm reminded of a story Hallelujah after the children of Israel and Paul and other prisoners were shrecked and they were gathering to put in the fire and a very vicious snake that was known on that continent if it were in Africa it would have been a black m because they say the black m is the most dangerous snake but all praise God because we have been given the power to B and to un that Hallelujah glory to God so when was by the they thought that he was going to die 5 Seconds they waited they thought he was going to have problem breathing they waited they thought that he was going to swell and die but Paul did not die and they looked at him and they say this one must be a god they were wrong but they were not so far from the truth because Paul in Paul was the life the life of Christ Christ the literal life that was in him so in other words the blood that was in po was richer than the poison s that is why when greater power comes lesser power must power oh Hallelujah and there is power in the blood precious wonderful power Hallelujah in the blood of the Lamb praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah there something special about the blood Hallelujah but in the book of in the Old Testament remember the Old Testament was a shadow things that to come now was the blood of bulls ands the blood of bus and gos excuse me I'm just laying a foundation so that when we get to the reading of the qu you might know exactly where we are coming from Hallelujah remember we are coming from the Earthly going to the heaven Le and what is it that guarantees us a place in the heavens is the spilling of the blood remember without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin hallelujah praise God now blood of bulls and goats bu and goats could not save you from sin blood and God could not save you from harits that is why they would come every year and offer a lamb of sacrifice for the same things that they did last year why because in the blood of BR and there was no power to change a life remember the life of an animal cannot replace the life of a human being so to take the life of a human being to replace the life that was in a man you can take the blood of an animal and put it in a dying man because the DNA does not mat hallelujah hallelujah but he took the blood of God he came down and became a k redemer and was like you and me so that his blood could transferable so that his blood could get in your body and Quicken your weak body hallelujah praise God hallelujah if you're following say Amen you know the power of the blood say amen hallelujah praise God the blood of bulls and goats could not change your life but it could only cover praise God for the Lamb of God that was slain before the foundation of the world Hallelujah he is dripping with blood oh yes is dripping with blood there still place on the atonement seat because the blood is still wet the blood is still flesh hallelujah hallelujah but let me tell you something it's not the chemistry of the blood no say because blood is corruptible Hallelujah if you start bleeding now and your shed gets stained in a few hours that shed will be smelling why because blood is corruptible that's why the prophet explains and says that it was not the blood not just the literal blood or the chemistry of the blood but it was the life the life that was in the blood and that life is what is hidden is what is veiled is veiled by the blood hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God isn't he wonderful isn't wonderful Oh Glory to God now we are going to read from the quotations to hear what the prophet say in the message the unfailing realities of the Living God 60626 6626 from paragraph 26 hallelujah hallelujah it was a matter of the blood was the blood that is why we sing that song I know it was the blood I know it was the blood hallelujah praise God it says here paragraph 96 it says now every born again Christian has a ro set before you you got to follow that road God marks it out what marks the road that's the question now the prophet is explaining now and is saying the blood it is marked by the blood and the spirit always lives in the blood Hallelujah but through the blood comes life blood cell is the Life Cell Hallelujah praise God hallelujah that is why we apply the blood and he say the Lord says when I see the blood I will pass over you what is it that he's looking at God is looking at his own spirit because the spirit's Dwelling Place the prophet says it always dwells it always dwells in the blood what is life the Holy Ghost is life that is why the Bible says he that believed on me and received of this Blood shall from Death un life hallelujah praise God once You' have had a blood transfusion you now have life the spirit of God that is why you cannot have a born again experience outside of the blood because the blood that's where that's where in in the blood that's where the life is in other words when the Bible says by one Spirit we Bap into one body Hallelujah is actually saying by one blood the blood of God himself because that's where the spirit is found it is found in the blood that is why Jesus Christ at the cross had to shed that blood oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God glory to God oh Hallelujah go again and read in the message the witnesses preach 1954 Witnesses preached 1954 the thir of March the third of March it says here he wasn't no man's blood yes he wasn't no man's blood it means Christ Christ he wasn't no man's blood Christ was not any man's blood blood he was the creative blood of Jehovah who created the blood cell he was neither Jew nor Gentile by Blood he was God God's blood God's blood saved us we were not saved by the blood of Israelite nor blood of an Israelite once is spilled it is corruptible once the blood of an Israelite it has got bitterness the blood of an Israelite has got double mindedness the blood of an Israelite Hallelujah has got hate that is why you have got Wars right now in Palestine because of the blood that they carry in the blood did you you know that temper is found in your blood that is why when you get temper you have high blood pressure why do you think that when you are troubled your blood pressure Rises it's because all those things they have found their an imprint in the blood that is why it was not the blood of an Israelite that was able to save us but it was the blood of God himself hallelujah hallelujah it was the creative power of God himself now when that blood comes in the life of a Believer oh praise God he can stand and say father I give you rain I give you rain and rain comes because he is the creative power this is why when you have cancer I stand and say you evil spirit iure you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ live and go and demons will live and demons will obey because in me it's not about the word it's not about the state of the body it is about the blood composition of the blood that is flowing in me hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah in questions and answers we are going to be reading a lot Hallelujah because I don't have any words that I can say don't have a new revelation Mal 4 has given us all the Revelation because shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be and the Mysteries are finished and we as the fivefold ministry our job is just to Echo back just to read from the books of the prophets like Daniel was reading from the books of the Prophet Jeremiah like Mah could not come and prophesy anything outside of what Elijah prophesied Hallelujah praise God now when we go and reading the questions of questions and answers of the series the LA having a shadow that was preached 1954 so that I can read fast in safe time wonderful it says from paragraph 156 there he goes I hear his old cross dragging down the streets making a roaring bumpy noise as it goes down his poor little bodies moving and they are walking along weeping him with a whep go on you Holy Roller you got we got our organizations we got our churches we don't need you to come around and ball us out of out and about our church you making yourself the god of the Sabbath why don't you do something about it now oh you Holy Roller and the Very Creator listen to this and the Very Creator moving along in the flesh there is that blood cell moving up and just bathing down his back as he moves a little further paragraph 157 now let's look I notice over his back there he's got a rope throw across his shoulder and his wolf through out without a SIM and now all over the little Rob now a little white uh Little Rob now a little white Rob there becomes a little red spot look at how it started it was a little red spot it's the blood coming through back where he was by his stripes were are healed oh could I deny that God keeping me mentally right I don't care if it costs me my blood what would my old dirty adulterated blood be at at the side of his hallelujah praise God what would be my blood my dirty blood what would be at the side of his that's why I don't care of my own blood in other words that's why I don't care of my own life because in my blood that's where my life is but the Bible says he that preserves his life the same shall lose it but he that loses his the same shall gain it that is why the prophet here is saying I would I want to keep my blood I don't care if they persecute me that's the problem we have with Christians today they are afraid of persecution they are afraid of losing their lives but your blood does not matter what matter is the blood of the lambed a small spot Hallelujah there I see moving moving as them watch as he goes on up them spots getting bigger and bigger and bigger as he moves on I see him fall I see a colored man come along and help him this is our forefather the prophet says this black man is our forefather here how many believe that how many believe that how many believe that praise God I see a black man colored man come along helping him bear with the cross put it upon his shoulder he moves on he can hardly move now look at him as he goes as he moving on all them little spots run into one big spot hallelujah amen it was the spot of Blood on the cross of Calvary but the prophet tells us that on the cross of Calvary that blood cell remember it failed life but for the life that was in the blood cell to be released the blood cell had to be broken in other words the blood cell had to be split when the blood cell was broken remember it started as one spot but those spots were becoming more and more and becoming bigger and bigger transferred from one life of a Believer into the other believer One believer into the other one believer into the other one beli into the other that's why there's not stopping the gospel because this blood cannot be stopped if it was a small spot if it was a small spot and it grew bigger that's the same with this message it's began in a long cabin but now it is around the face of the Earth and there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all of flame with the fire fill on P hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah that's that blood spot hallelujah hallelujah and after while I hear something now going brother bham slowly claps his hand what is it it's that old bloody garment beating against his legs what is animal blood finish there is the second Adam remember it took the first Adam and his blood to throw human race into chaos it also had to take another Adam and his blood to redeem him back and bring back into Fellowship that is why the blood cell is the secret of the access back to fellowship fellowship with the Creator Hallelujah because when you have his blood you become kle folks when you have his blood you do not just become a servant but you become an a of what God has but you become in a of who God is hallelujah you did not get that when you become an a of the things that the pastor has it means you can have his car it means you can have his house but there are certain things that you cannot have you cannot have the pastor's wife even if you in air there are certain things that you cannot have meaning that if you're in air to the things that he has you are limited but because of the blood we have become a of who exactly God is that is in the message the anointed the end the prophet says we are Messi we are Messi are say the young one of cow is a cow the young one of a snake is a snake what about the young one of God he is a God hallelujah hallelujah it's all because of the blood cell it's all because of the blood transfusion prise God there is the god of Heaven that's not animal blood that's God's blood Bea against second after I'm going to die for the human race God made Adam himself and living here on the earth I'm going to jump some things here paragraph 59 and the blood of BU and gods could not take away sin but in due season Jesus Christ comes and makes the the worshipper perfected by the baptism of the Holy Ghost who Jesus Christ died in his place at Calvary you see now the prophet is is continuously comparing and explaining and that's the Holy Ghost is the blood the Holy Ghost is the life in the blood Hallelujah in another message the Lord having a Shad this one was questions and ANW the having a shadow let me look for it here hallelujah and after we are done reading these things then we'll really get into the message and we just finish off I have a very small message all right um let me skip that let me go to uh says uh hold on Hallelujah it seems as though this just some little white Dre of hair he was walking through the the place looking around and there at once he stopped looked over again and started weep okay can you hold on let me just read through he wept for a few moments then I I see him bow his head and begin offering prayer wased him for a little while on the blood of 127 Hallelujah if the blood of Abra slaves brother generational spirit Power hallelujah hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God this is my last quotation CL this one I'm not going to read it I'm just going to paraphrase for you and I'll just read just a few portions now the prophet one day he went into a restaurant in that restaurant he saw an old woman this old woman was had a painted face she was all that you can call Jezebel have perfume it SM like Jezebel if you have noticed if you have noticed these women of the night they use the same perfume do you know why do you know why they use the same perfume right when you smoke a cigarette you are taking in it's air but that air when they want to taste to test to see if you have taken drugs what do they do they take Temple of your blood that is why these women they use the same perfume they the Revelation that smell it goes in and confuses the blood because that's what happens your blood gets confused then you see them very beautiful but if you see her in the morning you yourself why was she was because at that very moment the smell it confused your blood because it Go and confuses the blood that is why even Solomon says This Woman This harot she buys an expensive perfume and goes and puts on a linen because the moment that you enter there you are confused this is not where my message is but I just thought I should tell you so this woman had a perfume of some certain that was confusing the blood of many people were there there was a c down there red around the young woman and they were kissing anding each other and making love in the restaurant what a sight what a sight now the prophet says here and then when the prophet saw him saw he started condemning him God can you just wipe the face of the we tired of such things spoil our children that's the attitude of many Believers tonight is not converted and if you have not met Christ that's why you are so quick to judge another Pastor that's why you are so quick to persecute El because you have not yet the experience that the prophet after was doing all that he says now and the Lord called me behind the door and I saw a vision I saw the world and it's turning and I saw that my sins hold on and I saw that my sins and other sins was going I thought God why don't you just blow the place up I I how can you stand it but it but then I seen around the world was a crimson stream I seen the Lord Jesus Christ standing there in all all of his beity as he was looking down upon the Earth and I seen my sins as they went up to him but his blood act like a bumper before God they could not come to him I sin every time I do anything wrong his blood would stand between me and the judgments of God and I walked up to him and I said Lord in the vision is my sins doing that I said then forgive me God I didn't mean to do it he stuck his hand in my side and reached and reached over and got a little book uh in the side and reached over and got a little book and that name was and my name was written on all full of the sin and wrot and he wrot pardoned across it and throw it back behind him in the sea of forgetfulness he said I now forgive you for your sins but what are you saying about that woman when that Vision came out I went down and sat with her and I said lady was you ever a Christian she said why are you asking me for that and I begin to speak to her and she told me had broken story of how some things come up in the church you see the prophet was quick to judge he did not know what to put that woman in that condition but talking to him he realized what happened I hope I'm still on time I'm left with 10 minutes I'm about to finish now I'm going to jump she had taken the wrong road she had two daughters and they were nice ladies and now and how she was uh this is paragraph 24 that I'm reading in the message Jubilee 56 09:16 you will go and read it back at home and now and how there was with those two drunken men that afternoon I told her what the Lord Jesus had showed me and he still loved and I reached across the table caught her by the hands I said lady I don't care what you have done Christ still loves you right out of from behind that table she went in the middle of the floor the cop took off his hat and the all the rest of them and when they and we had an oldfashioned prayer meeting there and she was liberated and brought back to Christ it's a jubilee friends the jubilees on it's time for men and and women to come back to Christ hallelujah hallelujah amen praise God the prophet saw his sins he thought that he was so holy he thought he was holier than thou but he see the smallest of sins that he had done

was there making intercession hallelujah hallelujah when God wanted to see his he could not see them sin was blood the prophet explains when you take red your red is crimson blood of Jesus Christ that
