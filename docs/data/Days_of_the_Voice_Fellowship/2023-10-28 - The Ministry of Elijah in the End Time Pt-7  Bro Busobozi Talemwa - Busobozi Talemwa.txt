TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so I would like to greet the Saints at evening on zoom in the name of our Lord Jesus so if you can all turn with me to Second Kings chapter 4 and we have already uh spoken on the ministry of Elijah in the end time and we've been speaking on this subject for quite a while now but to the Saints on Zoom I left up uh I left on somewhere I just it will just be a continuation and for all of us even here at the the church it will be a continuation and uh just I have a few things that I have on my heart to speak to you may the Lord just you know give us inspiration to speak we are reading from vers 32 and we shall read up to vers 36 I'll read verse by verse with my brother and when Elisha was come into the house behold the child was dead and laid upon his [Music] bed and went in there and shut the door upon um and he went in there and shut the door upon them Twain and prayed unto the the [Music] Lord and he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hand upon his hand and he stretched himself upon the child and the Flesh of the child Works warm [Music] then he returned and walked in the house to and fr and went up and stretched himself upon the child upon him and the child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyes and he called gazi and he called gazi this is verse 36 and said call this shunamite so he called her and when he was come in unto him he and when she was come in unto him he said take up thy son amen let us pray father we commit ourselves to you at this moment Lord may you give me utterance may you just give Grace to us tonight for we do not know how to speak but may you give us utterance Lord give us inspiration father people that are listening to us oh God for these are the purches of your blood I pray that you reveal yourself to them that amen for your purpose that they will hear tonight you open their eyes of understanding and may they see the deeper things of God in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated I'm speaking to you today on the ministry of Elijah in the end time part seven and maybe for a little inspiration tonight a little at the seventh time sneeze amen at the seventh time sneeze so I want to say that we have established from all these things we've been looking at so we have established that the Bible teaches on the five comings of Elijah the first time Elijah came that was elah the and and and we've seen everything that Elijah the did he was anointed he was a prophet of restoration he rose the a child from the dead you know his ministry brought restored food restored life restored you know the power of God brought down rain you know went against the false prophets that was the first coming of Elijah and and the second time we see Elijah's Ministry in elishah because Elisha received a double portion of the spirit which was upon Elijah so now I want to say it this way when we say the spirit of Elijah we do not really mean Elijah incarnating other people we are meaning that the spirit of God which was working upon Elijah in the nature that he worked he continued working again on other other Generations the second time It Came Upon elishah and when you see the ministry of Elisha listen the ministry of Elisha is really I can say a duplicate of the ministry of [Music] Elijah everything Elijah did is what Elijah had done but in a double portion so that's the second time we see Elijah's Ministry the third time we see Elijah's Ministry is through the ministry of John the Baptist now when John the Baptist came they did not know who who uh who he represented they asked him who he was and he said I'm the voice from the Wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his path straight so John the Baptist again when Jesus came he said he was the Elijah which was for to [Music] come in many denominational circles they believe that John the Baptist was the one to finish the ministry of Elijah they understand listen they understand that John had the spirit of Elijah on him and they actually think that that Ministry ends with John but I want to tell you tonight the ministry of Elijah continues on after John because John only fulfilled his portion of preparing the coming of the Lord turning the hearts of the fathers to the children which were the Jews previously not knowing Jesus Christ so the ministry of John prepared their hearts to receive the Messiah but you see the Bible says he was in the his ministry was in the power and spirit of Elijah but the people never understood at the time before the coming of the Messiah the people never understood that the ministry of John was actually in the power and spirit of Elijah they missed it and because they missed it they also missed the coming of the Messiah when the Messiah came they never understood who he was why because they missed John when you miss the coming of Elijah you will miss the coming of the Messiah Elijah's Ministry only comes to prepare the people's hearts to receive the Messiah and so we found that John the Baptist was that Elijah his name was John but his ministry was in the nature and in the spirit and in the power of Elijah if you understand that say amen and then we see Elijah comes the fourth time you see the fourth time now is is coming to the Gentiles and we notice that this was William Bram now I trust that all of you believe that some of you don't believe that William Bram was the fourth Elijah we can have another service to prove that to you but today we want to to also go on that line a little bit to prove to you why William Branham why this age has received William Branham who is actually the fourth El and why in the end time so I say that unequivocally without any doubt was the fourth Elijah that is without any debate and if you agree with me you can say Amen praise God but that is to the Gentiles we are coming back to that just hold that for a moment and then we notice that the fifth time Elijah comes he comes now to the Jews and in Revelation 11 the Bible speaks of two witnesses it says that one of them had the power to turn water into blood that is Moses and then the other one he had power to call fire from heaven so that is the the ministry of Elijah so we notice that the Jews will also receive the ministry of Elijah again but that will be after the Rapture and therefore that is not our ministry that Ministry is not really about the Gentiles is coming after the Rapture for the Salvation of the 44,000 Jews but for now where are we we are right here at the coming of the fourth Elijah now listen to me oh the five comings of Elijah really benefit the Jews except for the fourth one William Bram went from America and he was going to go to Israel but do you know what the Holy Spirit stopped him God spoke to him when he was up in the air and told him don't you do that don't you go there why don't you understand that William BR you know you have to go and find that video they interviewed him and they asked him whether he thinks that he his ministry will be received in Israel he believed yes he said yes I believe he said because the Bible says the the Greeks seek after wisdom and the Jews seek after signs and the ministry of William Bram was that Anointed with the Min with with the spirit of Elijah to do signs and wonders to call fire from heaven to show the sign of the Messiah if if he went to Israel their eyes would have opened they would have understood the Messiah and it was not yet time for them to receive the Messiah the time of the Gentiles was not yet finished so God did not allow him to go there there would come another man who have the same anointing like Elijah like and he would go to the Jews but that would be after the Rapture of the Gentiles so God stopped him he told him you cannot go there it is not yet time praise God so only the fourth Elijah came to the Jew the Gentiles everything about the Jews is known everything about the Jews is numbered so much that we even know how many will be saved among the Jews but for the Gentiles it is totally by Grace by grace and grace alone God is dealing with us as individuals Ephesians 2:8 it says for by grace are ye saved through faith amen tell somebody we are saved by grace we are saved by grace in Romans 11: 24 amen I'm sorry I have a limited time here and so I'm going a little faster so you have to think quick and follow follow these details now so Romans 11:24 it says for if thou were cut out of the Olive Tree which is Wild by nature and you graft contr to Nature into a good olive tree contr to Nature how much more shall this which be the natural branches he crafted into their own Olive Tree follow me closely here God intends to cut off the Gentiles God intends to do it God intends to cut off the Gentiles and return to the Jews but first the times of the Gentiles must be fulfilled for he said you were saved by grace you the Gentiles you came in by grace and he said you were the Wild Olive Branch you were removed from the wild and you were you know brought onto this Olive Tree and the original branch of the Olive Tree was cut off and then you you were grafted he says he asks a question then if God can take a wild branch and C it onto the Olive Tree how much more those who were the original how easy will it be for him bring it back and graft them again let me tell you the Israel is original Church the gospel came to them first but because they rejected it they were blinded for your sake that you may receive the Gospel you were grafted on by Grace not of your works that you can boast of it hallelujah hallelujah that is why I cannot understand anyone who preaches the gospel of works because the gospel among the Gentiles is a message of Grace amen we have been grafted on by Grace but remember not permanently up to some time when the full of the Gentiles has come then we shall be cut off again and then Jesus will go back to the original Branch Israel and graft them back on again okay let me interpret it what he is saying that the Jews right now don't believe Jesus because their eyes were blinded so that can now call the Gentile bride when the last Gentile bride has come here it is time for Jesus now to go back again to the Jews the Gentiles will be left in their denominations in theirs and dogmas and he will go to the Jews so he says now I want you to follow me closely here Romans 11:25 for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own Concepts that blind bless in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become [Music] in praise God praise God so there is a Time coming and here it is when the fullness of the Gentiles has coming how long or when will it come in please listen to me the fullness of the Gentiles com in by seven Church ages from EP to the time of the Gentiles from Ephesus Jesus is beginning to call his bride he continues calling his bride up to Revelation 1 verse 10 I was in the spirit on the Lord day and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou see us write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia now this is John seeing these visions and the Bible says he actually gives a testimon that he was in the spirit on the Lord the Lord's day I told you is the day of the Holy Ghost when you receive the Holy Ghost you are in the Lord in the Lord's day when you receive the Holy Spirit you have received your Sabbath if you understand it say Amen so now he says here you know I am Alpha and Omega what you see right in a book and send it to the seven churches he says these churches arew in Asia Asia is the Gentile land not Israel so these are GLE churches the first one is epes the second one is thir is and and he continues on on verse 13 where where he speaks of the mystery of the candlesticks and the Mystery of the stars please follow me Clos verse 12 he says and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and now this is John turning and he wanted to see the voice that spoke with him and he saw seven golden candlesticks and in the M of the of the seven candlesticks one like un the son of man closed with a gar down to the and the with a golden G all right now his head as his head and his ears were white like wo as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like the fine like fine brass and if they bur in a furnace as if they bur in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand [Music] Seven Stars tell your neighb Seven Stars and out of his mouth went that sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength so when he turned he saw seven golden candles and he also sawen one that was in the middle of the seven golden cand like a son of man and then he also saw in his right hand there was seven stars all right so we we are seeing 777 we began with elishah elishah prayed stretched himself over the the child and the child sneezed how many times seven times so we're coming down to find the seven Gentile dispensation which is the time of the Gentiles and it comes in its fullness after the seventh church but we cannot understand that until we see the vision of John saw the Gentile Church John saw the the Gentile church as a seven Candlestick so the seven candlesticks was the fullness of the Gentiles listen after the candlesticks then comes Israel again right before the candlesticks is Israel after the Candlestick is Israel so now we are seeing the candlesticks in the middle there so in your mind you can draw the the Star of David here and the Star of David here and the candlesticks in the middle are you following me now but yet in the middle of the candle there were seven there was one who was like the son of man and in his hand were Seven Stars what does it mean every Church age had a star every Church age had a star but those stars were in the hands of God it was in the hands of Jesus Amen they weren't on their on their own they were in the hands of him him that is Alpha and Omega that is the beginning and the end these Stars don't have their own message these Stars don't have their own life remember the Sun that was in the middle of the of the candlesticks is the one who has the light the stars reflect the light of the sun are you following me the Stars don't have their own light the stars reflect the sign the light of the sun well here is talking of the s o n but we know it can it might as well be the S praise God because they they were reflecting the s o n [Music] light the son of God so what does the candlesticks mean what does the stars mean Revelation 1:17 and when I saw him I fell at his feet as death and he and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and I am the last I am he that liveth and was dead Hallelujah oh I'm so glad to serve he that is alive he does not say I am he that is dead who was alive but he's saying I am he that live I am he that was dead and he's alive I want to say Jesus is alive today he's alive in his church he's alive in his bride churches out there are praying for Revival but we are in the Bright's Revival we are waiting for the CH our Revival is here amen our Revival amen is the message of the hour amen that comes by the power of the Holy Ghost change our bodies one of these morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we will wake up to the resurrection [Music] I'm he that was dead and behold I am alive forever amen and I have the keys of hell and of death he has the keys Hallelujah tell your neighbor he has the keys he has the keys he has the K oh my good Lord write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be here the mystery of the Seven Stars which you have seen in my right hand seven The Seven Stars are the Angels tell your neighbor the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and the Seven Candlestick which you have seen at the seven churches how many churches that Jesus have he has only one Church which is said upon this revelation of the world upon this revelation of who I am I will build my church and the GS of Hell shall not Prevail against the Church of Jesus Christ is built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ and and and this is the same church that has been in all the chur all the Seven Ages when he say seven churches it is just symbolic to Seven Ages so the GLE Church there is's alloted in a period of Seven Ages 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven how many times remember did the child sneeze seven times we are coming back to that what was it meaning they were aimed and then relax you know you know ephus was the beginning they had the anointing of a lion and they had the truth the purity of the word and then somewhere they began to relax SM is simply you know it simply talks about two things death and bitterness you know and you know as the church started now to receive persecution and you know means married the church now married state they became one the the church and politics married and there that was the beginning of the Roman Catholic Church movement but remember in each of these ages had a star that kept the light shining it might have been a little light but it was shining in it kept life in and then come after p means a dominating female that is when the do of the trity covered the whole and almost the truth was lost complet but God had a little life a little light inise God hallelujah hallelujah oh my I wish I go in the details there comes sadis s you know sadis means the escap on why because this was the era or the edge of Martin Lu protestantism started when there was gross Darkness covering the Earth amen God had his little star Martin Luther he came and he began to Shine the Light of the World by preaching just shall live by alone you know he escaped the false Church system began the Reformation movement which we call the Protestant movement and then comes the 60th Church age Philadelphia Philadelphia means brotherly kindness this was a generation where the gospel went all over the world and the star of that age being a man called John Wiley a man who preached love a man who preached sanctification amen man who preached that if you have love for your brother you are going to go and give him the gospel amen a man who preached if you you have amen Christ in you if you're truly justified by faith you must truly be sanctified by the word of God you know and then after Philadelphia then comesa the Street Revival which amen brought a new era of Pentecostalism also this was the beginning of the last age the last Candlestick are you following me now the last praise God and then you know means people's rights that's why I say we are here we are in we people's rights Women rights children rights homosexual rights everybody's right this is the time this is the last AG the seventh age then where is the seventh star the seventh star must be here oh we are not in each Church age have a St messenger by the grace of God the last one would actually be the Elijah to the Gentiles Hallelujah amen I want to say this is not a coincidence some people like Alexander they thought they were Elijah but their Ministry did not fulfill Elijah's ministry as prescribed in the Bible thought he was going to restore righteousness and Holiness by ining cities that are holy physically started what they call Zion city in America and he was planning to buy a great big piece of land in Israel to buy a to build a big Zion City there for the Lord we found that that's not the way that Elijah's Ministry would be Elijah's Ministry in the end time would restore all SE Hallelujah not start some religion not start some denomination not some or something or some M I want to say that's why we believe William BR his ministry was that of Elijah because it fulfills everything the Bible said El God spoke to to William BR in 1933 when he was baptizing the 17th person seven again Hallelujah and he spoke to him and say out of the pill of fire thousands of people were there and the voice John the Baptist was sent for on my first your message will for on my second God himself declared who Elijah was in the end time just like Jesus himself he came and declared John Was Elijah Even in our generation Jesus himself through the pill of fire declare that William BR was the Elijah in theend praise God then he returned we are back to Kings now he returned and walked in the house to and fr and he stretched himself upon the child and a child sneez seven times and the child opened his the child Snee one two three four five six times but he still was blind he still was dead awake but dead not yet fully restor but wait until the seven hallelujah hallelujah when the child sneez the seventh time hallelujah hallelujah his eyes open then it rose from the dead then it was full restoration full restoration the Bible says in the days Revelation 10:7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel seventh angel when it shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his Revelation 3:18 can thee to buy of me gold DED in the fire that you may be rich white that you may be closed that the shame of your nakedness do not appear and anoint your eyes with eyes you may see Hallelujah I'm just burning up with re when the child sneeze seven times under whose Ministry the Min of el who had the spirit of Elijah on him and the Bible is telling us in there are going to be Seven Ages seven gentle ages but remember each age has one St messeng are you following me and we are finding out that the last Star Messenger to the seven church will be El he's a man with a Ministry that has the anointing and the power of the life and the Bible has declared that amen the sounding of the voice of the seventh prophet of the seventh Star Messenger the seventh Star Messenger when he sound the Myster is finished no more silence amen no more Darkness the mystery is finished the seals are going to be open the word is going to be open amen Revelation is going to open up why because the seventh Star Messenger is the Elijah which the Bible says when elah comes he will restore all and now the Bible tells us hallelujah hallelujah under the church of God is celing us to buy gold toen fire the message of the seventh messenger is God DED in the fire the message of the seventh messenger is white rment the message of the seventh messenger the eyes s for our eyes when the child sne the seventh time his eyes were open when he Reed the message of Elijah in your day your eyes of understanding will open up hallelujah hallelujah you can no longer be blind Hallelujah all the Mysteries will be opened up to you the message of the Gentile Elijah finishes the mystery the church amen the church would be blind no more tell your neighbor the

Bible says that the would be blind and they would not know than God for Elijah Ministry our time because we will not be blind God has opened the eyes of praise God and I finish up with's case Second Kings 59 so came with horses and with his Chariot and stood at the door of the House of elishah and elishah sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash in Jordan seven times and they and thy flesh shall be shall come again to thee and thou sh be clean but was rough very many people today they don't want to believe the message of they very angry when you talk about it I'm sorry to say they will remain dir they will remain dir they have to receive message of the seventh angel messenger which is coming at the seventh time genti churches Hallelujah and N the Bible says was Ro and went away and said behold I thought we have had a messenger that has come to us and he says lean not on your own understanding God wants to do everything I have shown you that the ministry of Elijah [Music] does if you want food God wants to give you food Prosperity God wants to give you Prosperity if you want healing God wants to give you healing whatever you want if you want a wife God wants to give you a wife if you want a husband same thing but listen not on your own understanding you must hear what the messenger says You must do what the messenger says if he says pray you pray if he says fast you fast if he says seek the holy ghost seek the Holy Ghost if he says don't miss chch don't miss chch he says pay your T pay your T whatever the messenger says you do whatever he saying and watch your need being provided behold he says I thought surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord and strike his hand over the place and recover the liap and not and rivers of Damascus better than all the Waters of Israel may I not washing them and so he turned and went away in r but his servants came near and SP unto him saying my father if the prophet had bid thee do some great [Music] things thou not have done it how much rather than when he saith thee wash and be clean then went he down and dipped himself seven times in Jordan according to the saying of the man of God and his flesh came again like unto the Flesh of a little child and he was clean I want to say this message is for the simple in heart if you think you are educated if you think you are so knowledgeable if you think you are so rich and you have need of nothing I am sorry the message will not help you you will be in the message but you remain sick you remain bound and chained you need to humble yourself Amen to the
