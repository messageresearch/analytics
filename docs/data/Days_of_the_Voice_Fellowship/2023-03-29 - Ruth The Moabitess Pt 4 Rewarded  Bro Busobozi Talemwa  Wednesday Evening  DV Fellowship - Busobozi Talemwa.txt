amen we're just uh get into the world this evening [Music] oh The Book of Ruth together okay we're seeing there there is none like you together and then we're reading the book of Ruth chapter 3 verse 16. uh 16 to 18. now so today we are speaking on Ruth the more biters fourth part and we'll be talking about Ruth being rewarded [Music] amen Amina I believe Ruth would sing this song so there is none

Lucy is amen we're reading the three verses out of that and then we will continue on on chapter four together is and when she came to her mother in law she said who at thou my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her and she said these six measures of Bali gave him me for he said to me go not empty unto thy mother-in-law then said she sit still my daughter until now know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this day [Music] foreign are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this evening so we are speaking on Ruth getting rewarded I was thinking that the Book of Ruth is a very uh good book for believers to study because it actually has the whole Bible I'm just you know through these Services I'm just touching a few bits and pieces if I was attacked by vas we can actually start the whole Bible out of the Book of Ruth [Music] so I can decide that we take the Book of Ruth for an entire year having Services twice a year a week to my records because as I was studying it you you kind of feel that you are getting almost to every part every Doctrine every part in the in the scriptures [Music] you will find out that Ruth was not just the more about us but Ruth was more than that she was she came it appears as if where she came somebody was already waiting for her because she wasn't a strange person coming into a Strange Land again she was a person that was coming back into a place where she was supposed to be foreign [Music] why we have some people who don't believe in Jesus Christ is because they think they can't understand the force that brought them into this world I think I was speaking to one young man a few days ago [Applause] amen amen that's why the Bible says that in deep Sleep When when sleep falleth on man one man is in deep Sleep God brings him Vision God brings them dreams believe us dream and have visions in the night let me tell you we dream and see things of the future I don't know whether it has ever happened to you whereby you find yourself in a place and you see as if you had been there before we are in the past God has made for his own and let me tell you we might not realize who we are today but the more we hear the word serious finish the thing this day and I say our Jesus our borrowers could not rest until he had finished it at the cross yes you are February and I want to say remember how he grown remember how he cried even blood the whole night remember how he was under pressure and Restless when he went to the Cross he said it is finished Jesus could not rest until he was on the cross to finish it yesterday what was he going to finish he was going to conclude the Redemption process all the deciding queries Ruth went through time of decision Jesus Christ by living the life of a Believer or of a Christian two words receiving the Holy Ghost and then he leaves his life through us our yes for all this let me know your name is nothing without the Rapture that is the reward coming friends praise the name of the Lord and I want us to see now after that little Preamble I want us to go through now the book of chapter Ruth chapter four and since on Wednesday I usually want to do one hour so I want us to uh you know stick our minds together and put everything aside and let us delve right into this foreign [Music] I might have started this I might have waited upon the Lord I might have little Inspirations for you but you have to receive it in order for the Lord to use me for you um just put everything aside and let your minds be here just you know respond to the word and let God speaks verse 1 then went for us up to the gate we shall first read up to verses 9 and then we We Carry On from there and we'll read the rest of the portions as we go on then when was up to the gate so we're not going to interpret it just listen and read through your Bible as well then went for us up to the gate and sat him down there and before the king's man of wumba was spec came by unto whom he said ho such a one turn aside sit down here and it understood and sat down and he took 10 men of the Elders of the city and said great City down here and they sat down and he said unto the Kinsmen Naomi and he said unto the king's man Naomi that has come again out of the country of Moab seleth Apostle of land which was our brother El merichis and I thought to advertise thee saying buy it before the inhabitants and before the Elders of my people if thou will redeem it redeem it but if thou will not redeem it then tell me that I may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and I am after thee and he said I will redeem it then Boaz then said was what day thou bias the field of the hand of Naomi thou must buy it also of Ruth the moabitus the wife of the Dead to raise up the name of the Dead upon his inheritance and the King's man say they cannot redeem it for myself lest I MA my own inheritance redeem thou my right to thyself for I cannot redeem it now this was the manner in in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing for to confirm all things a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor and this was a testimony in Israel therefore the king's man said unto the world buy it for thee so he drew off his shoe and Bawa said unto the elders and unto all the people you are witnesses this day that I have both all that was early marriages and all that was Chileans and macarons of the hand of Naomi now as you remember when Ruth was resting at the feet of boas told her but you see there is another one and closer Kinsmen who can redeem and redeem all that was early marriage but as for me yes I'm in the lineage of redemption but I am not the very one supposed to redeem there is another one and so now but what's called a meeting and he brought he brought this man at the gate and he told him that is a wife of our brother and she has a pastor of land foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign foreign [Applause] Hallelujah man let me tell you Jesus Christ yes Christmas of the root of David and as you will see here in the Book of Rules this is where David comes from this is where you know you know this lineage of Ruth as we shall see here by the end of the services to be able to die on the cross because the Bible says there is Uganda foreign himself foreign exactly and he would remove issue and put it up as a sign now I'm redeeming all of you see me I'm ready that's what Jesus did that's what God did the Bible says in the book of Philippians chapter 2 so we create this mind be in here being in the form of God he was taught himself because he found himself in a fashion as a man yes so that he even died on the death of the Cross what was he doing he removed his shoes for you and me in order to do the work of them are you not grateful for him the bridge between the seven Church edges and the seals then pray to Mary as much as you want to there was no man in heaven there was no money no being nowhere else John even wept about it oh Catholic friend can you see that don't pray to some dead person the lamb is the only mediator can you say amen he was the one that came forth what did he do now he's been back here in the city he has been up here in the city until his blood has a torn for every Pastor who could do something foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] foreign Hallelujah [Applause] foreign [Applause] foreign moreover Ruth the more abide is the wife of Marco now of course you're just following me in your Bible please if you can or you're on the screen or just listen to me moreover Ruth the more but is the wife of Marlon have viper chest to be my wife to raise up the name of the Dead upon his inheritance that the name of the Dead be not cut off from among his Brethren and from the Gate of his place ye a Witnesses this day and all the people that were in the gate and in and the elders said we Are Witnesses the Lord make the woman that has come into the house like Richard like Leah which too did build the house of Israel and do thou worthily in Ephrata and be famous in Bethlehem and let the house be like the house of fairies whom Tamar bear unto Judah of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman so bawas took Ruth and she was his wife and when he went in unto her the lord gave her conception and she bear a son now listen to this and the women said unto Naomi blessed be the Lord which has not left thee this day without a king's man that his name may be famous in Israel and it shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life and a nourisher of thine old age for thy daughter-in-law which life is thee which is better to thee than seven sons has borne him and Naomi took the child and laid it in a bosom and became nurse unto it and the woman her neighbors give each a name saying there is a sun born to Naomi and they called his name Obed he is the father of Jesse the father of David amen this is the line where Jesus came from our own Lord Jesus did the Bible say he would be the root of David Bible and here rules gave birth to a son or a bit um and yes I get back to David yes and the Bible said that David would have an everlasting Kingdom even when Jesus Christ comes in the Millennium foreign Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] we call it the Throne of David but guess what right there when he's ruling other kingdoms we fit the bride will be right by history oh my this is amazing praise the name of the Lord we are going to read Psalm from the Revelation chapter 5. from the message in the year 61 it says Ruth Ruth making her decision many times of course you know I read without quoting at all I really preach without quoting them but on some messages I really feel like I should tell you what the prophet says directly and this is one of it so follow me here it says Ruth Lucy making her decision a type of the church a gentle Church she decided crossed over into the land now a lot of times we methodists uh Baptists we think that's all you have to do a message she had just got started she hadn't got nowhere yet she just got over into the line now the next thing she had to do she had to work she becomes a legalist she had to work out her own salvation with fear and Temperance when you become a Christian the first time you even feel like oh this is so hard this is so bad why is it so difficult why is it so hard because you've not got to the place of resting foreign looks like a whole thing of legalism and you see Ruth had to walk out her salvation with fears the methodists and the Baptists arrived at and stopped it's never Baptist because the methodists and the Baptists really their religion is all about works really really that's much but you see we have to go on we think that's all you have to do but you see she become a legalist she went out into the field and put her clothes upon her again and went out into the field and green behind the maidens in order to get sustaining food for the day again what was she doing she was trying to find amen [Applause] to the point of working together you collects and everything we have to leave that on God bless the place of Grace we are just resting at his feet and we are doing everything he's telling us the point of receiving the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is not the end the holy spirit is the honest you're the only payment yes still that's not the end game some Believers I think when you decide to follow Jesus yes [Music] that's just the beginning there are many people who get baptized and will go to hell yeah that's the truth is baptism does not take you to heaven and yet you must do it you must make the decision you must do the works but the works will not make it for you it's not because you did this but because you dressed a certain way or you cut your hair grow up because you need to use makeup Oh Heaven is sure that's not all of it wax is a must for a Believer um you are foreign [Applause] alone doesn't take it to the Rapture Hallelujah as the bride of Christ to the stage of resting the moment you receive the holy ghosts you don't care about nothing it is nothing is hard for you anymore you heard the wrong things and then God gives you that as the honest of your salvation you have not arrived foreign ah am I preaching to someone speaking in tongues dancing the spirit Hallelujah committed until Parker the work is finished it is him [Music] you know it might not be that all that will go through the process will be those oh Jesus but it is all those will be part of those that went through the process so much you get it [Music] we're okay if the rest to me Hallelujah man he's going to finish this tell your neighbor he's going to finish yeah Hallelujah man and so friends because I was still reading that quote that is exactly what the church did the Lord has believed it by faith is told sanctification which was the legalist standpoint you've got to do something I got to quit I got to let my hair grow out say the women of course they don't do it no more they don't they didn't do it they did do it they did do it at first but they had to quit wearing the pants they didn't wear their skirts wrong not at first they did not wear this classrooms shorts like the others did they had to do something that's what she says don't go in the fields no more time comes am I preaching to believe us today time comes when the field was no longer bothering ruth hey she said Hallelujah you have to go back to digging when it comes to the search of wrestling it is now more of his work and he called it Masterpiece it is he is the one who sculpt doing the sculptor yes when you come to the stage of resting and rewards and this is where the bride of Christ is amen we are no longer now preaching like the lutherans and the methodists we are now I'm speaking collectively as a bride we are now at the place of resting God is here [Applause] it is that is the way you need to get to the Holy Spirit foreign in this message and when Ruth was resting it was a type of the church resting promises the church is not resting on the Promises we are not worried whether we are going over there or not again and he says Amen brother that must excite you again are you going or you're remaining I said praise the name of the Lord you he says we are not worried whether we are going together

amen getting a husband or being redeemed yeah Hallelujah she was sure about it I am now sure about it because I have found my king is born my boys that's right God says because it is has accepted us Crystal nowhere to get away from it we are there amen all we have to do is just to wait Factory waiting for the time that we that when he comes back and then when the next thing Ruth was Ruth was
