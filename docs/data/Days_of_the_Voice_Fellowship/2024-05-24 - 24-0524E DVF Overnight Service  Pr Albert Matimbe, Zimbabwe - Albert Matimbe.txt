that when you have a vis that everybody be a partaker of that blessing uh we have brother alexana God bless you amen and um so today we have a minister uh pastor Albert matim Al all the way from Zimbabwe Allelujah amen specifically from a place called concession concession uh I've been there I think he was the first person to invite me uh out of East Africa uh he I don't know how he got to know me but I think he saw my website which I had put up at that time I was a very young boy it's um I'm trying to see how many years ago it was let me try to do some math here uh okay so that was 13 years ago and uh he I was very young at the time uh but somehow he invited me and we had I remember it was they were holding a convention there I think I don't remember the number of people maybe close to 600 were attending that youth youth youth camp and so I was the youngest of the preachers and I think I was 19 or 20 around that time and um if you remember brother how many remember brother K sing the South African brother he came here brother kin sing kin oh sing yes yes so brother kin was one of the speakers at that youth comp and that's where we met so Pastor mtim had invited him invited me and that's why met so uh it was a very a very wonderful time that we had at the time I I had planned to I was at campus at University at the time and I had planned [Music] to just go away for about a week or two and but I ended up when I preached on that youth conference uh they uh there were many pastors and so we got many invitations out from that and God gave us more more open doors in so I went planning to spend there a week but I ended up spending there more than one month and it was a very lifechanging time for us we went to many places I remember that that is when we also ministered for the late Pastor Chessa took me toess and then I had a conference with Pastor Chessa a talk I met him for the first time there and uh afterwards when we talked he liked me very much and then he said I'd like you to come on Wednesday and we are going to have a youth meeting I thought we are going to have maybe 100 or 200 young people so when I moved from the office very large building so when I moved from the back side of the office and came in the auditorium the I almost fell down almost 3,000 people it was my first time time so many uh Believers parked in one place at the same time and not only that that I was supposed to preach to them I lost strength in my knees and I was like H the pastor told me to the youth he should have told me is a service of everyone so I was uh so disappointed in myself that I thought I was not ready for speaking to these people but by God's grace uh I remember I sang a song I still remember that brother M very well I theong um uh I love him I love him because he first loved me and then God gave me Grace felt the anointing of God upon me and I started preaching I preached on desperation it was a wonderful moment together with Pastor matim would then go on to move to other rural areas of zimb remember we went to a place called guu very cold um you know you could feel the coldness through your bones that it was a very rural area we didn't even have a car so we went by public means and when we were coming when we came out of the of the car go to where we were going it was many kilometers I don't remember how many but it was many kilometers and we I I we had blankets and our bags and so I they gave me mine I carried a very huge blanket and put on the head and we began walking I still have that picture and I I was walking and walking he was older than I but I was getting tired and I was wondering that this man is not getting tired he very strong and he really challenged me that I felt I have not done anything for the Lord and I can go on and on relating what what happened on that tree I remember when I was going there on that same trip in Tanzania that is where I also had a few experiences which I've shared with many of you uh I will not go in the details again but several so I mean God used Pastor mtim in the early years of our life and Min I thought that that trip that I had in Zimbabwe at that time was a very good time for for us as we were entering into Ministry Pastor matim is a pastor there in concession but also he a missionary many countries around Africa and uh I just trust whatever he will have to say sing We just have a few moments with him um he will uh shortly after he preaches he's going to go on a bus or on a taxi to uh what's the name of the place to where he will be in the morning ministering for pastorate so you can see he's a very committed man so we should value the time that we have with him and to those of you that have been able to come thank you for coming you've not come in vain Jesus has a table SP amen and uh his sons he has two sons very close friend of mine they're currently in the UK but we keep in touch each so we just pray just commit ourselves the Holy Spirit asking that the Lord will minister to us is that a prayer that you have amen so he's ministered for many years very simple man but a very great man in the in the things of God pray that you just commit yourself to the Lord and that he will minister to you tday let us on our feet as we welcome Pastor m let us give a clap of Praise as Pastor BEC God bless you you're welcome thank you God bless you uh we want to appreciate God tonight uh can you enjoy your seats briefly uh you know when you are being given your roses or flour when you are life at least it makes you smile and when the servant of God here tells you that in one way or the other God helped helped us to at least contribute to What the Lord Has bestowed upon him yes some way back as he said when he was just a young boy I invited him to Zimbabwe and of course the recommendation came through Pastor bang church church he pass on he was a friend of mine and uh 2001 I came to Uganda then I I met Pastor Leo during that time and Pastor Le from who happens also to be close um minister to to Pastor today praise God so I've been around in East Africa been to Bui I've been to D talk of Randa talk of Kenya Tanzania Tania uh I've have seen the hand of God well to give you I mean overview uh what carried me to this day I want to appreciate God that he called me to save him I got into the message at the age of 13 when I was just a young boy in the primary grade six that's when I got hold or the Lord got hold of me and uh by his grace I've never tasted beer neither have I tasted cigarettes praise God and the lord gave me Grace that I only know one woman who is my wife and after the wedding praise God I'm also grateful that I I when this young man is now old now when he came to Zimbabwe yes we moved around name them all where our sister Chase is scatter she's a very good friend of mine the time came when he was about when he was to redeem somebody the sister here can I see your [Applause] face you recall that I came to your wedding to be identified with the joy that you had so when your pastor was graduating I also came yes sir yeah to say to to Rejoice together with him that party has not been mentioned but I I must say with you that we've come a long way together so I'm not ashamed to be in front of you tonight by God's grace hallelujah amen in in the pilgrim walk God has allowed us I have to share with you that I'm not ashamed to stand before you as a minister of the Gospel uh he has told you that I've been to many countries maybe 30 or so in Africa in Asia and also in Europe well one Minister I met recently he said he said you have not yet fulfilled the Great Commission if you have not preached in America so he say come over to America and preach the gospel so I by God's grace one of the days I'll be there to fulfill the Great Commission praise God as I was moving in different countries h i i i i i i got an experience or experiences where there were some prophetic utterances from within the churches in 1995 when I was in Mala uh there was some some utterances uh with some ministers there they told me uh the Lord is saying you are going to have a Ministry I will share with you on that part I got a dream and in that dream I was in the center of har and it was a well that was so deep and I was told by The Voice you got to go down and build the wall of that well not crumble in so I said no I can't do that I have no experience my father is the one who had experienced when I was resisting there came from Heaven a tied onto a Rob from heaven and then I found myself I was I was thrown into that and the te was rolled the down of the world and I was resisting pushing the Wolves why are you sending me down I told you already but I couldn't overcome the the Rob went down when the te reached the bottom I saw a rock underneath I felt there was a rock underneath the bucket that rock surface pushed that me up to the level ground or the ground level that when I was in that well I could see people outside then when that happened I had some confidence I can build those walls were brothers I saw gathered around and they were giving me ground nuts when I was in that building that and then the interpretation was you have got a work to do you shouldn't resist praise God that was in 1995 in 2006 I went to uh 2006 I went to AA Nigeria after preaching there some a sister came with this a pastor and he said uh when you were preaching the voice from the Lord said I will send you to many nations preaching my gospel you have not done any work yet that was 2006 I come back to 2001 my first experience inala Uganda just after ministering conven there was some prophetic utterances the conation yes and 2002 when brother was alive when I was about to finish preaching he started prophesying speaking Tong he said it's not brother M who speaking it's I the Lord who has spoken and when we were there we went on the floor down on our knees in the convention we were praying pastor Pastor Bas was there Pastor Michael there was also Pastor Chris from I'm mentioning those names for Witnesses this is what transpired in the pilgrim or PR walk in my journey as a minister of the Gospel praise God I'm also reminded when we were in Moos the Lord said some prophetic my children don't worry even though you are in this Zone which is politically volatile I am with you in 2013 when we were in groombridge there was some prophet don't worry my children you are going to have a successful convention and you shall have a convention we had a successful I take you to 2016 when I was in I was SE there and I I was being I'd be informed that I would take a service for me I was wondering what is it that I would say before many people people had come from America others from Australia Philippines nor itself and other countries I look it myself said what good can come out of nazare I say to you know English is a second language to us that's not my mother it's a bored language so sometimes you you wonder what grammar would you put for what expressions of prophets you can put across that people can understand you in that dilemma one man in the congregation started speaking in t those of you who know brother strowman brother strowman was in one corner he started to interpret he said my son my son don't worry about what you are going to I've put a thought in you and that thought preach don't get puffed up just humble yourself I will use you knew that I I was the one going to preach so then I I saw tears coming down my my my my I had my handkerchief I started wiping and when I went to the podium the Lord did prom God speaks he encourages us praise God I'm just sharing with you some of these testimonies among others that we've been called and you know William Bram said in this end time God is putting his army together composed of women and men oh brothers and sisters to fight the last battle this end time that says Mali 4 and I'm not ashamed to declare before you that I've been cted in that very Army in that army that will fight the last battle in this enti some few months back by God's grace uh they made me to be trained as a Chaplain so that I can also be of good use the uniformed forces in my country so when you see me I'm part of the police force as a in my own country by God's grace when I was I mean um finding my way in the afternoon to get to where we are coming from from I I saw on my phone the provincial chaplain is saying are you back in Zimbabwe there's a work for you to do we are waiting for you here so I'm saying Breen in as much as you need me here there are others somewhere who are also saying where is he we need him we need him here we need him there praise God and according to the Book of John chap 9:4 I must work or do the work of my father when it is still daylight because night shall come when we shall not be able to do this work however why do you see me Crossing continents and Nations the reason is I'm living on a borrowed time I'm living on a borrow time Hallelujah I'm bringing this testimony to you that in October 2006 I fell I felt very sick I got ill I vomited a lot of blood on the 2 of October 2006 and when I vomited blood I passed on I died those of you who would die when I don't know when I don't know let me give you an experience of how death is so that you don't get surprised that day when you are dying is not painful but sickness is yes so hear from us who has experienced death so that when you die you won't be surprised we' have told you when you are dying you just feel as if you are getting asleep and you will be going but you you will be conscious that something is happening now I living planet earth that is what I experiened and of course my wife was there and the place where this happen Pastor reached that by that time I was staying in so I share with youen that during that night when I passed on when I died being in the dimension of the Dead I remember talking to God I said Lord I know I am dead but if you can be gracious to me and allow me to live to go back to I'll do your your work and I had an audible voice God saying will you do my work upon that conversation those words I came back to life now you read you read Bible you hear that Hezekiah when he was told by prophet that you must sh your inheritance because you are going to die of course that was what the prophet had said but heah he looked at the world to God lord remember what I did remember what I have done remember my contribution cried sincerely before the prophet left the court voice said go back go back and tell King that I've his give him 15 more years and he was given 15 more years but by the grace of God me have passed 15 years good mathematicians here if you say 2024 us6 you get 18 years 18 years living on a borrowed time when I said Lord allow me to go back to so that I can do your so when you see me don't feel sorry for me I am on a b just rather pray for me that we can work together in encourage me to work for the Lord praise God now before we open our scriptures I want take you to Zimbabwe in in a song sung in my mother Tong praise God so that you have the feeling of Zimbabwe we speak sh let's hope in in heaven be speaking sh however we are going to speak the heaven language but the Heavenly language praise God but let me just let me sing sha song for you understand what theim how they sing praise God God bless my brother I want to sing a song which says I need that tree I need that tree that Zak has climed I need water which went in I need that c Elijah put on so I want to sing that yes yes go by [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] know that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] Z [Music] [Music] f know know [Music] praise [Music] God on God I need that tree Z I also need that GH that filled up the disciples praise God I request you to stand on your F by God's grace and we go to Second Kings very good uh 2 Kings chapter 6 second second Kings chapter 6 verse one read read and the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha behold now the place where we dwell with thee is too straight for us let us go we pray thee unto Jordan and take then every man a beam and let us make us a place there where we may dwell and he answered go ye and one said be content I pray thee and go with thy servants and he answered I will go so so he went with them and when they came to Jordan they cut down wood but as one was F failing a beam the ax had fell into the water and he cried and said Allah Master for it was borrowed and the man of God said where f it and he showed him the place and he cut down a stick and cast it in thether and the iron did swim the therefore said he take it up to thee and he put out his hand and took it yes for may the Lord bless the reading of his word enjoy your seats praise Goden as Christians we are glad uh to know and to realize that our faith comes second it is high above all other ReliOn don't be ashamed to be identified with Christian faith because the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ rose from the dead yes sir this is the only religion that is managed to put people together which break breaks geographical boundaries real Christianity knows no politics real Christianity knows no racial discrimination real real Christian denominationalism not churchism real there is no geographical boundary there's no separation of Brotherhood there's no doal differences no wonder why Messenger to the ludan church we have no other text book but the Bible we know other other Jesus Christ he said we are change without love but love no boundary the world is my Parish I'm saying tonight real Christianity there's no differences discrimination people are closely bonded to one another in 2008 I made a trip to Israel and I went to find out whether this preachers he preached the truth they he from the death so I had to go there to prove I tell you Brothers his faith been graphically proven to be you go to geography they will tell you exist if you want to go through archology you still prove that the Bible is truth I passed through Egypt on my way to to to I mean to Israel yes and in Egypt there is a museum [Music] there that tormented the children of Israel is there in the glass the museum you see the body is dried up that that body is there so that when we tell you that there was a who commended the children of Israel historically archeologically you can prove that when the Bible tells you that there were pyramids or pyramids in Egypt those pyramids are still there even today you can go there I went there and the pyramids it is true the Israel built pyamid and what not if they tell you that there was M Elijah the prophet one man in the hands of God challenged the prophets of God my brothers there's m in isra and your brother by God's grace stepped on those of the Tomb I went into the tomb and I stood there is this way my master so so I also resurrect even if you bury me I will just follow the example of my master I will resurrect I have all reason to believe that because I gave you a testimony that in 2006 I died but I asked the author of Life bring me back to life and I lived again and you see me today I'm a living testimony yes sir in case the doubting Thomas is here who don't believe that I mean Christianity is something that is real when you are looking at me I'm a living testimony I rose from the dead just like Lazarus just like and many others in yes that came back to life we have proved proven these things we are really convinced that this is a true faith my brothers one day well I got I felt compassion the Muslims and I went to a mosque I went there and I I wanted to find out if I can get one from the MOs so I went there MOS you have to know how they do so I asked how do you go about you take off your shoes and I took off my shoes say you took off everything you wash their feet and wash your head put water three times you your Shir and then you you enter the so I did that yes but however in Theos they don't sit on comfortable chairs and I wonder why you don't hear the word of God why don't you understand the word of God and why you don't believe because the Muslims they don't sit on CH they sit on FL FL like this then they start worshiping Arabic in Arabic and me I joined them I join the Muslims they sit in RS been to ethopia he knows that that's what they do I had to do that and when they were praying Arabic language me I was praying in Jonah they will not hear or understand what I was talking but I was saying Lord all these people are lost because the founder of their religion Muhammad is still in the grave but the founder our religion Christian faith and I'm a witness to that Lord give me one person here so that at least I'm consulted come to this MOS and God had my prayer as I was as we we finished the proceeding I stopped someone and I said my friend wait wait for me so is we putting on shoes because you don't you don't Ender with your shoes you have got to leave them by the door going out I stopped him and then he he complained accepted my request I took him away from the m and I bought him some bananas just just to buy some time see what I'm saying buy I bought some bananas and we started eating I told him my friend there's something which worries me about our church where we are coming from says what what about it my friend I didn't experience to go to Israel I saw the grave of the found of Christian he he he rose from the dead I saw an empty tomb but this church of our whose founder is Mohammad still in the gra they keep on changing hes after the other so that when he resurrect he will ride on one of them but it is what happened now Frankly Speaking my friend which of the two religions this Muslim found has noten Christian which one surpasses the other and this man told me of course the Christian found is already the Muslim is still to rise then I opened up I said that man don't forget about that I'm not a Mim I'm happy to find people like you speak positive about Christian that is where I Bel and that man was happy he said you know what I'm glad to hear what you are saying may I come to this church because my boss is a member of this church my heart is not here hallelujah oh God I saw him coming the next Sunday to yes sir these are some of the things that we would do so when I told you I'm also counted amongst chap so you know what it means praise God very good so we know by God's grace given us uh the opportunity and the ability to stand for him to proclaim the goodness of his name praise God now not to divert you so much scripture reading we have heard about Elijah Elijah and the sons of the Prophet the sons of the prophets they said this area or this place where we are we are it does not Sur it it has become narrow it cannot accommodate us we want to go where we can cut the land clear trees so that we can get enough land to accommodate us yes sir and the prophet said that's a good that's a no thing clear the for yourself my brother you know in the Bible there was ja was born in a poor family 1 Chronicles 4:9 and 10 his his mother was very poor was very poor he did not have anything know what he did he prayed unto the Lord he said Lord if you can enlarge my yes sir and make me to overcome my enemies the Lord answer this don't be comfortable shallow condition of life that you are when you have got a better idea idea and a decision go and clear more land for yourself make exploit don't just live in a corner your life is being shallow narrow going get more benefits and the prophet answered that's a good idea the good work young Brothers when you in your heart you feel that you must go out preaching there you go go and clear more land take more land yes sir but the good thing is one of the young the sons of the prophet he says we cannot go alone you go with us yes sir you go with us and El he said oh yes I can go with you
