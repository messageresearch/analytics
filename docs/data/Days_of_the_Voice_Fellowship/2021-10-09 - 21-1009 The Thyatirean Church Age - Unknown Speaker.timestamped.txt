[15:58] going into our study on the church ages
[16:01] about the henry we're happy to have you
[16:02] today
[16:04] with us and um
[16:06] those were with us also by way of zooms
[16:09] uh
[16:11] uh john god bless you there saquero god

[16:15] and uh
[16:17] my wife usually attends in the

[16:20] children she's always in the cry room
[16:22] so she always attends
[16:26] via the zoo here so god bless you also
[16:29] uh you know if you could have a fist
[16:32] surprise
[16:46] are they
[16:58] okay what about the sister that brother
[17:01] martin is one
[17:05] okay fine so we want to utilize our time
[17:09] and straight away go to the theater and
[17:11] chat and we we started the temple church
[17:14] age
[17:15] um
[17:16] last week friday
[17:18] and uh
[17:19] some of you missed that because we
[17:21] didn't stream it we had the
[17:23] internet uh we had power problem our
[17:26] power was off here so we did not stream
[17:29] uh for obvious reasons but then also we
[17:32] covered until
[17:34] uh
[17:35] page 221
[17:37] which was european
[17:39] the
[17:41] people of tatira or the believers of
[17:43] batteries
[17:58] meaning to uh
[18:00] near the end of
[18:02] the age
[18:03] as much as we shall be able to cover
[18:05] today usually i don't want to plan
[18:07] things because
[18:09] i want you know this bible study i
[18:11] wonder what spiritually they want to
[18:12] drive us on everything if the speed
[18:15] drives you then uh
[18:18] you can always encourage just a bus or a
[18:20] live or something like that and then you
[18:22] will accomplish this purpose just just
[18:24] through that so you don't want to find
[18:26] yourself possibly finish the chapter
[18:28] when you form what nothing you know you
[18:31] want to find yourself
[18:33] following his leadership amen
[18:36] and so i'm going to put this that can
[18:38] can you try to connect that speaker so i
[18:40] can try to see if you can
[18:42] get audio here
[19:19] okay so we're just trying to get our
[19:21] orders here
[19:23] in order for us to
[19:26] before
[19:41] first
[20:04] okay
[20:06] all right
[20:18] [Music]
[20:29] first
[20:50] yes
[21:09] oh
[22:13] me
[22:14] [Music]
[22:29] [Music]
[22:34] me
[22:38] [Music]
[22:46] [Music]
[22:54] [Music]
[22:58] oh
[23:07] [Music]
[23:32] but we are filled with a spirit
[23:40] [Music]
[23:44] oh yes that's the old time saving and
[23:47] you know that the thing said oh
[23:57] oh
[23:58] i like the old time singing preaching
[24:01] shouting praying
[24:16] [Music]
[24:30] i
[24:42] i
[25:02] [Music]
[25:06] is
[25:08] [Music]
[26:49] okay so we seem to be having issues with
[26:52] our audio but
[26:53] we can connect and hear from
[27:11] revelation 2 19
[27:14] i know thy works
[27:17] and i patience and thy works and the
[27:20] last to be
[27:23] here again
[27:26] three remarks
[27:28] it works
[27:29] the son of god himself said
[27:32] believe me for the very work's sake
[27:34] he put an emphasis on his own works
[27:37] while on earth
[27:38] the works that he did were ordained of
[27:40] god to inspire faith in him
[27:42] it was a great part of his ministry
[27:45] his holy spirit and the apostle paul
[27:47] said
[27:48] for we are his workmanship created in
[27:50] christ jesus unto good works which god
[27:53] hath ordained that we should walk in
[27:54] them
[27:56] ephesians 2 10
[27:58] these works were to inspire faith in him
[28:00] as they would show forth that
[28:01] relationship to him that paul described
[28:03] as created in him
[28:07] now works will never take the place of
[28:09] faith in god for our salvation
[28:11] but works will show forth our faith
[28:13] already placed in him
[28:15] good works won't save you but they will
[28:18] come forth out of a saved life as fruit
[28:20] unto the lord
[28:22] amen
[28:23] it is now what
[28:26] will take the place of faith in god for
[28:29] our salvation
[28:32] in other words
[28:35] it says now what will never take the
[28:37] place of faith in god
[28:39] for our salvation in other words
[28:42] words cannot replace faith
[28:45] you cannot say
[28:47] that you are saved by your words
[28:50] that because you dress well that means
[28:52] you are saved
[28:53] because you speak well that means you
[28:54] are because you baptize yourself you
[28:56] understand yes that's why some people
[28:59] believe that it is what about this that
[29:00] saves them it is not a trudeau dream
[29:04] there is no thing that you do in this
[29:06] life
[29:07] that gives you salvation that's right
[29:09] nothing
[29:10] tell
[29:22] but there is no one that can see
[29:24] salvation without christ every work that
[29:27] we do all the works which we do it only
[29:30] shows our faith which we have already
[29:32] blessed in him very nice what do you get
[29:34] for whatever place in the name of all of
[29:36] jesus christ you are showing your faith
[29:38] with you you already pressed in christ
[29:41] while you dress well you are showing
[29:43] your faith with your brother possessed
[29:45] in christ why do you stop you know
[29:47] fornication you are showing your faith
[29:49] which you have read a place in christ so
[29:52] the things that you do only shows your
[29:54] faith with your brothers here right come
[29:57] on somebody are you following this
[29:59] so good words won't save you but they
[30:01] will come forth out
[30:03] of a safe life as fruit unto
[30:06] the lord sister fortunately just missed
[30:08] something wonderful here you know
[30:10] you say
[30:12] the good works cannot save a man yes
[30:15] what you do will not save you but if you
[30:17] don't do it
[30:18] you're not saved that's right
[30:30] that's right
[30:31] because he said that he shall know them
[30:33] by their
[30:34] wax it is by their works by your watch
[30:36] the people will know you the bible says
[30:38] if you love one another jesus said if
[30:40] you love one another they shall not they
[30:42] who the people of the world
[30:44] believe that they
[30:46] shall know that you are my disciples in
[30:49] other words what you do shows who you
[30:52] are tells people
[30:55] your words tell people
[30:57] who you are in me in christ
[31:00] your words show
[31:02] tell the people who you are let me bring
[31:05] israel your words show that people your
[31:07] position in christ whether it is in
[31:09] christ or in the devil that's right amen
[31:12] so he says that once we show forth our
[31:14] faith which you have rather placed in
[31:15] him good works won't save you but they
[31:17] will come forth i would say other uh of
[31:20] a saved life as real and you know oh my
[31:24] isn't that wonderful
[31:26] and then he said i believe in good works
[31:30] so someone said what's what said you
[31:32] therefore don't worry my sister bless
[31:34] the way you want god doesn't see your
[31:36] wax he sees your heart amen
[31:41] you know you know what you do it doesn't
[31:43] matter it doesn't really matter what you
[31:45] dress what you do it all matters you
[31:48] know what you believe you know this is
[31:49] what some of our people here are
[31:51] preaching you know what your faith is
[31:53] you know
[31:54] you can see how they can miss their life
[31:55] the line is still now
[31:57] very now
[31:58] yes we believe what's going to save you
[32:00] right yes we believe i do believe that
[32:02] there's nothing we do that will ever
[32:03] give you salvation
[32:05] right yes whether good or bad doesn't
[32:07] give you some question
[32:10] but
[32:12] your words show
[32:14] who you are
[32:17] there is no
[32:18] look
[32:19] friends let give me a moment here i just
[32:21] i wanted to leave this by the way speed
[32:23] was saying you know stay there for a
[32:25] while all right for somebody here look
[32:28] we have a mango tree right here
[32:33] i've got in our in our little garden
[32:35] here in the compound
[32:36] but what good is this that
[32:38] feels
[32:39] now let me ask you a question
[32:41] for
[32:42] two three years we've been here for
[32:44] three years that number three has been
[32:46] there right yes
[32:48] did it have a mango for us please
[32:50] no no
[32:52] it seems to be a mango tree no no
[32:55] it's been a manga tree
[32:58] even without fears
[33:01] that's why we say
[33:03] we do not know who the children of god
[33:04] are
[33:05] we do not know who the seed of god are
[33:07] but here's the secret oh father he
[33:10] pushed the veteran
[33:13] he said that he will make sure that he
[33:15] sees that
[33:18] whatever the city must produce his kind
[33:21] yes the seat must produce his kind and
[33:23] the seed of god he will make sure that
[33:25] he will ensure that his sin doesn't you
[33:27] know
[33:28] depart he
[33:29] he trusts he has confidence in his seat
[33:32] you know god has confidence in his
[33:34] sister and he is what i'm trying to say
[33:39] now that mango tree
[33:41] is a mango tree even without the fruits
[33:45] a child of bone is the child of god even
[33:47] without that truth
[33:49] whether they address trousers when they
[33:51] are women whether they use makeup or not
[33:53] whether they go for fornication or not
[33:55] before they know christ if their
[33:57] children know their children oh god
[33:59] there's somebody right now doing those
[34:01] things but when they are the bread of
[34:03] christ and they don't even have an idea
[34:05] about it right
[34:07] because they have not yet found who they
[34:09] are they don't know who they are
[34:12] but i'm saying he was never you know
[34:14] slamming the denominations the people in
[34:17] the illumination but he was slamming the
[34:19] systems
[34:20] it's a systems which get those people
[34:22] you know imprisoned in that kind of uh
[34:24] understanding but the people are people
[34:27] of god in there there is a bride of
[34:29] christ
[34:30] but here is
[34:31] the important thing here the secret is
[34:34] god
[34:35] who is the husband man
[34:37] god who is the owner of the seed god
[34:40] knows who
[34:42] they are where are you
[34:44] he knew you even before you knew him
[34:46] that's why we
[35:12] [Music]
[35:27] you must do
[35:29] who has got to join me like i have
[35:32] god bless you my sister after you have
[35:35] come to the realization of the season of
[35:38] who you are you must bring forth fruit
[35:41] amen
[35:42] that mango tree has been there for two
[35:45] years since it was planted
[35:48] and
[35:49] never
[35:50] did we ever see a freedom
[35:52] but it did not become a proper tree it's
[35:55] going to be the mango tree
[35:57] but now
[35:59] it just flowers and it's doing important
[36:02] so how pretty why is it it's just the
[36:04] right season for you to bring forth us
[36:07] if he doesn't bring the mangoes in this
[36:10] season that actually must be cut off it
[36:12] is of no use
[36:14] it's not because
[36:16] it is not it it's a clear sign it's not
[36:18] the right
[36:19] type of tree or the red sea
[36:23] now those who claim to be christians
[36:26] those who came to be followers of christ
[36:28] and their words are evil satanic wildly
[36:32] when they are claiming to be of christ
[36:34] one year three years fear is a clear
[36:36] sign they are not treatment of christ
[36:38] amen because it's the truth of christ
[36:40] their words will matter
[36:43] when they come to christ
[36:44] hallelujah
[36:46] so you see what it says here
[36:48] oh man i just forgot that that is so
[36:50] wonderful yes so wonderful i i wanted to
[36:53] see what he says here he says
[36:55] no watch will never now rush will never
[36:58] take a place of the faith in god for our
[37:00] salvation
[37:02] but
[37:03] what
[37:05] will show for
[37:06] our faith
[37:10] already blessed in
[37:12] hallelujah
[37:14] because i'm a christian i'm going to
[37:15] stop wearing many
[37:17] scars because i'm a christian i'm going
[37:18] to stop wearing trousers if i'm a woman
[37:25] because i'm a christian i'm going to
[37:26] stop drinking why simply because i
[37:29] realize
[37:31] i've come in the season of realization
[37:34] of who
[37:43] [Music]
[37:47] show me your faith without your wrath
[38:03] show for the works you must be changed
[38:07] let us continue i believe in good works
[38:10] even if a man is not saved he ought to
[38:12] do good works and do the best he can
[38:15] what is horrible in the sight of god is
[38:17] for men to do evil works and then say
[38:20] that they are doing the will of the lord
[38:22] that is what the bishops and popes and
[38:24] the hierarchy of rome were doing
[38:26] they were killing maiming and doing all
[38:28] manner of evil in the name of the lord
[38:31] they lived out lives exactly opposite to
[38:33] what the word teaches
[38:35] in that evil day those true believers
[38:37] shone like a light in a dark place as
[38:39] they continually did good for they
[38:42] returned cursing with blessing
[38:44] and did the truth to honor god even
[38:46] though many died for it
[38:49] in this verse he is commending his
[38:51] children because they were living
[38:52] changed lives
[38:56] testified to a new spirit within men saw
[39:00] their good works and glorified god
[39:03] yes sir if you are a christian you are
[39:04] going to do what is right
[39:06] your works will show that your heart is
[39:08] right
[39:09] and it won't be something that you put
[39:11] on for you will do his will when no one
[39:13] but god sees you and you will do his
[39:15] will even if it costs you your life
[39:19] i know your love service faith and
[39:22] patience
[39:23] you will note that their love is placed
[39:25] between works and service and that is
[39:28] the right place for it because without
[39:30] love our works are not accepted before
[39:32] god and neither is our service
[39:34] paul speaking to the corinthians said
[39:37] without love i am nothing and whatever i
[39:40] do is without profit unless it is done
[39:42] in love
[39:43] now you can see right here that these
[39:45] believers weren't in that nicolaitan
[39:47] class that did works as a means of
[39:49] salvation or to be admired by men
[39:52] they did their works out of the love of
[39:54] god that was shed abroad in their hearts
[39:55] by the holy ghost
[39:57] that love in their hearts was god's love
[39:59] for his own
[40:01] jesus said
[40:02] by this shall all men know that you are
[40:05] my disciples that you have love for one
[40:07] another
[40:08] the pagans who saw the lives of the
[40:10] early christians said
[40:12] behold how they love each other
[40:14] john said
[40:16] everyone that loveth is born of god
[40:18] what you are doing are you doing it out
[40:20] of love or are you doing it out of
[40:28] you know
[40:31] don't pretend as if you've never
[40:33] understood what i'm saying even if it is
[40:36] sure right
[40:46] that is why
[40:47] i don't really
[40:49] i'm not so much inclined on
[40:52] these public offertories you know
[40:57] it seems to have kind of uh
[41:00] lost meaning that that teaching that
[41:02] jesus was teaching
[41:04] was that he told when he was a man
[41:06] how
[41:07] a woman came to live
[41:10] and uh
[41:12] she gave her a few and a rich man
[41:14] came and he also gave much
[41:17] but you know the way he was busting and
[41:19] moving and how yeah woman just put in a
[41:21] little you know what she had but jesus
[41:24] said yep they both gave but when jesus
[41:27] was
[41:28] trying to talk about their giving he
[41:30] said that uh who gave the most
[41:34] why
[41:35] because the woman did that with love
[41:38] with all her heart she made what she did
[41:40] she did not do it for let them know that
[41:43] i am the one who is the kind
[41:45] let them also realize that i can you
[41:48] understand everybody gives one thousand
[41:50] two thousand one thousand two thousand
[41:51] and then you bring fifty thousand let
[41:53] them know that i'm the one who cares but
[41:55] some people have again used that to say
[41:57] where you should give a point and now
[41:59] they take a point because jesus you know
[42:01] for many that man who gave a point so
[42:03] they also bring your calling because
[42:04] they want to be like they are a woman
[42:06] you are like the other rich man also you
[42:08] see you're not like a woman because
[42:10] if you are like the old woman you you
[42:12] will business here that old man was
[42:14] sincere she gave everything she had
[42:17] are you giving everything you have when
[42:18] you give a point
[42:19] you see
[42:22] that's what i'm saying
[42:24] and it does also it does not also mean
[42:27] that you should give all that you have
[42:29] to be pleased by god
[42:31] i mean to please god right
[42:33] it's not like saying you should give all
[42:35] you have to please god if he has rebuilt
[42:37] you should give all your heart to peace
[42:39] but then do it
[42:41] and giving should be out of your heart
[42:44] not out of what others
[42:47] out of what you want others to see
[42:49] about you to know about you
[42:51] then
[42:52] uh it's also trying to give a coin
[42:55] to be like the other woman when you have
[42:58] to the color yes
[43:00] you leave it there in your pocket and
[43:01] then you take a coincidence
[43:04] you know you are just lying yourself you
[43:06] are eco friend you know you are like the
[43:08] other rich man you know
[43:10] you see
[43:11] so
[43:12] if you have much give much
[43:14] if you have little give it in others
[43:16] give whatever that you have it's not
[43:18] only in giving it's
[43:19] also in doing do all that you can for
[43:22] the glory of god not for your own growth
[43:25] not for your vein glory i would say you
[43:27] should not do something out of vague
[43:28] glory but we should do whatever we do
[43:30] out of the will of god
[43:33] for the
[43:34] for the glory of god not for our being
[43:36] glory not for them to see me to know me
[43:39] to love me to praise me but i want to do
[43:41] everything i do for the glory of the
[43:44] name of my god hallelujah so when you're
[43:47] coming here even in bible study or
[43:49] church or going anywhere for the sake of
[43:51] the work of the lord are you doing it
[43:53] because others have told you or because
[43:55] you want others to see you you must do
[43:57] it out of a true heart not out of uh men
[44:00] that are kindness
[44:02] you see this
[44:05] first john 4 seven
[44:08] i want to give a warning right here
[44:11] it says concerning the last days that
[44:13] because of abounding iniquity the love
[44:15] of many will wax cold
[44:17] in the laodicean or last age
[44:20] self love and love for material things
[44:22] will take the place of the true love of
[44:24] god
[44:25] we need to guard against the power of
[44:27] sin in these last days
[44:29] so many are getting so hard because they
[44:31] haven't realized the effect of this last
[44:33] day spirit
[44:34] it is time to draw an eye to god and let
[44:37] him fill our lives with his love
[44:39] or we will feel the coldness of the last
[44:41] day church and reject the truth of god
[44:43] which alone is able to help us
[44:47] in those dark and dreadful years the
[44:49] true vine held its love for god and love
[44:51] of the brethren
[44:53] god commanded them for it
[44:55] i know your service
[44:58] jesus said
[44:59] he that is greatest of all is servant to
[45:01] all
[45:02] a wise man commented on that saying
[45:05] here is what he said
[45:07] only history will prove the truth of
[45:09] that dictum
[45:10] that man was right
[45:12] all the truly great men of history have
[45:14] been servants they who demanded to be
[45:16] served they who oppressed they who
[45:19] sought to always be at the head have
[45:21] gone down in shame
[45:23] even the very rich are condemned by god
[45:25] when they have not used their wealth
[45:27] right
[45:30] all through the great men of history
[45:32] have been
[45:33] asked
[45:35] was jesus uh a servant
[45:40] jesus you said that they would they
[45:42] would be managed to be served they will
[45:44] oppress they were so to always be at the
[45:46] head i've always gone down here
[45:50] my brother even you at your home when
[45:52] you're with your siblings yeah
[45:55] i'm your i'm the biggest in this house
[45:57] you should do all of them
[45:59] you know that type of
[46:01] idea is always bad
[46:03] you remember how they used to oppress
[46:05] joseph
[46:07] but they all worshipped joseph
[46:10] but they used to oppress you
[46:12] so god can bring the littlest the humble
[46:15] yes the smallest among us
[46:17] and lift him up to serve us
[46:20] that's right
[46:22] and make
[46:23] him roar over us
[46:26] what i'm saying is
[46:27] if you want to be
[46:29] uplifted by god and best yourself humble
[46:32] yourself
[46:32] but if you want to be at best then you
[46:34] live to yourself
[46:36] the way up is
[46:38] down if you want to go up humble
[46:40] yourself
[46:43] do not at any time try to oppress others
[46:46] or control them
[46:47] do not at any time want to become lord
[46:50] over others you are not meant to be a
[46:53] lord of another god wants to be the one
[46:55] take that position yes even when you are
[46:58] someone's husband
[47:00] you
[47:01] you should not intend to just
[47:03] be a lord yes you are you could develop
[47:05] that you are our lord but don't try to
[47:08] show it
[47:09] be a servant
[47:10] christ was our lord
[47:13] but he was our servant
[47:15] imagine that kind of humility
[47:17] by the panel of preachers
[47:19] god hiding himself in the simplicity and
[47:22] revealing himself in the sense what is
[47:25] killing people
[47:26] why are people killing each other
[47:28] because each person wants to be on top
[47:30] of the other and to oppress and control
[47:33] their
[47:35] do not do that we should always see each
[47:37] other as though the other one is higher
[47:39] than me
[47:41] you see
[47:42] because you are the oldest or because
[47:44] you are the youngest because you are the
[47:45] richest or because you are one it
[47:47] doesn't make you any better you are the
[47:49] same
[47:50] you must have and don't don't try to
[47:52] make it out
[47:53] let it flow through you let it be
[47:56] a part of your life whereby christ will
[47:58] come and take over your life whereby
[48:00] your humble yourself you are
[48:02] really humble from your heart
[48:04] you
[48:17] you know this and that you know you kind
[48:19] of feel that others should be on below
[48:21] you and you should be up there brother
[48:23] and sister
[48:24] you go to prayer and ask god to feed you
[48:26] the horribles because it's a clear sign
[48:28] you have nothing to do
[48:30] you see
[48:31] jesus
[48:33] says i know your servants
[48:35] he wants us to be servants he doesn't
[48:37] want us to be loads over the others she
[48:39] wants us to be servants of one another
[48:42] oh my god
[48:48] but look into history and you will find
[48:50] that the truly great were those who
[48:52] served others
[48:53] history can never acclaim those for whom
[48:55] much was done
[48:57] but it will forever praise those who did
[48:59] much for others
[49:00] now let us apply that to ourselves
[49:03] even as the son of man came not to be
[49:05] ministered unto but to minister
[49:07] so we are to follow that example
[49:10] see him as he bows himself over the feet
[49:12] of the apostles and washes their tired
[49:14] and dirty feet
[49:15] he said
[49:16] you don't know now what i am doing but
[49:18] you will know him
[49:21] hereafter but what you see me doing you
[49:23] ought also to do
[49:25] he became a servant in order that god
[49:26] could elevate him to the highest heights
[49:28] and one day in the judgment of the
[49:30] saints we are going to hear him say
[49:32] well done good and faithful servant
[49:34] enter thou into the joy of the lord
[49:36] it is hard to be always a servant
[49:39] but those who spend and are spent for
[49:40] others will one day be seated with him
[49:42] in his throne
[49:44] it will be worth it all then
[49:47] let us labor for the master from the
[49:49] dawn till setting sun
[49:51] let us talk of all his wondrous love and
[49:53] care and when all of life is over and
[49:55] our work on earth is done
[49:57] and the role is called up yonder
[50:20] is
[50:34] is

[50:43] [Music]
[50:48] [Applause]
[50:55] [Music]
[51:03] [Music]
[51:05] and when all of life is over
[51:08] because one day it's going to be over
[51:11] and our work on earth is that
[51:14] and the role is called up yon
[51:17] who will be there
[51:29] and one day the judgment of the saints
[51:31] we are going to hear him say well done

[51:42] not wrong
[51:44] good pastor
[51:45] oh well what a grateful person some
[51:47] people don't call them
[52:04] [Music]
[52:17] a brother because he wanted to be a
[52:18] servant he wanted us to feel like for us
[52:21] to feel like he is one of us and he was
[52:23] one of us it's not our own suffering
[52:26] that we are worshiping
[52:28] your brother
[52:29] you know so well that would have
[52:31] faithful also
[52:34] nothing like that
[52:35] whether that would have faithful prophet
[52:38] whoever done as good as grateful stop
[52:41] entertaining the joker it is hard to
[52:44] always be a servant is it easy
[52:47] whereby everyone is the one who always

[57:05] [Music]
[57:16] [Music]

[59:39] one more time
[59:41] [Applause]
[59:50] [Applause]
[59:53] i give
[59:54] myself to you
[1:00:00] hallelujah amen amen you give yourself a
[1:00:03] way to do all right
[1:00:05] you know when you realize that to be a
[1:00:07] servant
[1:00:08] is the most precious thing
[1:00:11] to him
[1:00:13] for you
[1:00:14] then you would indeed say i give myself
[1:00:17] let my life be a living sacrifice
[1:00:20] amen but those who spend understand for
[1:00:24] others will one day be seated hallelujah
[1:00:27] and one day be sitting with him in his
[1:00:30] throne it will be one with all this
[1:00:34] hallelujah
[1:00:35] you don't really want it all
[1:00:37] it will be what is it all to be a son
[1:00:39] yes hallelujah
[1:00:44] it's just wonderful and then you also
[1:00:46] tell them i know your faith let's follow
[1:00:48] that i know your faith
[1:00:50] now he does not say here as he did to
[1:00:52] the church in pergamos you hold my faith
[1:00:56] he is not talking about his faith now
[1:00:57] but he is commanding them for their
[1:00:59] faithfulness
[1:01:01] and as he does he also mentions their
[1:01:03] patience
[1:01:05] now faithfulness and patience go
[1:01:07] together
[1:01:08] in fact patience is the outcome of
[1:01:10] faithfulness for it says in james 1 3
[1:01:14] the trying of your faith worketh
[1:01:16] patience
[1:01:17] there is absolutely no other way in
[1:01:19] which to gain patience it has to come by
[1:01:22] the trial of our faith romans 5 3
[1:01:26] tribulation worketh patience
[1:01:28] how highly god regards this outworking
[1:01:30] of our patients is seen in james one
[1:01:33] four
[1:01:34] but let patience have her perfect work
[1:01:36] that you may be perfect and entire
[1:01:38] lacking nothing
[1:01:40] god's will for us is perfection
[1:01:43] and that perfection is patience waiting
[1:01:45] on god and waiting for god
[1:01:48] this is the process of character
[1:01:49] development
[1:01:51] how highly god has commanded these
[1:01:52] saints of the dark ages
[1:01:54] patient as lambs led to the slaughter
[1:01:56] lovingly faithfully they served god
[1:01:59] that is all they wanted out of life just
[1:02:01] service to their lord
[1:02:03] how great was to be their reward
[1:02:06] i know
[1:02:07] i cannot pass this without talking about
[1:02:10] this he says
[1:02:12] right there
[1:02:13] okay right here
[1:02:15] he says now
[1:02:17] he does not say here
[1:02:18] as he did to the church in vegamos
[1:02:21] you hold my faith but he tells them he's
[1:02:24] not taking talking about his faith now
[1:02:28] his faith but he is commanding them
[1:02:31] for their
[1:02:32] faithfulness and as he does he also
[1:02:35] mentions their past
[1:02:39] things
[1:02:41] now faithfulness patients go together in
[1:02:43] fact patience is the outcome
[1:02:48] here
[1:02:49] patience is the outcome of faithfulness
[1:02:52] for instance in john james 1 3 the
[1:02:55] trying of your faith works
[1:02:57] patience
[1:02:59] you see so
[1:03:01] if you cannot say you have faith that
[1:03:04] you've been
[1:03:06] faithful without being uh a
[1:03:10] patient
[1:03:12] patience is the outcome
[1:03:15] of faithfulness
[1:03:17] because you've been faithful
[1:03:21] because you you you've been faithful to
[1:03:24] the death because you've been faithful
[1:03:29] because you've been faithful to his wife
[1:03:31] because because of your faithfulness
[1:03:34] we cannot say you have
[1:03:36] patience
[1:03:39] so that is how you get that
[1:03:42] you get to that level
[1:03:44] of
[1:03:45] patience
[1:03:47] by being faithful to his wife
[1:03:49] and of course will not be faithful
[1:03:51] without suffering certain things so you
[1:03:53] have to suffer those things and overcome
[1:03:55] them
[1:04:03] i know thy works and the last to be more
[1:04:06] than the first
[1:04:08] this is certainly remarkable
[1:04:10] as the darkness of the age increased as
[1:04:12] the honor roll of the martyrs grew
[1:04:14] lengthier day by day they worked all the
[1:04:16] harder they served all the more and
[1:04:18] their faith increased
[1:04:21] how tragic it was that in the ephesian
[1:04:23] age love waned
[1:04:25] and truly nothing is said of the
[1:04:26] increased labor of love in the other
[1:04:28] ages
[1:04:29] but in this age and the darkest of all
[1:04:31] ages they served him even more
[1:04:34] what a lesson that is
[1:04:36] there is no ceasing of this gracious
[1:04:38] service of love unto the lord but rather
[1:04:40] an increasing of it
[1:04:42] that is the secret
[1:04:43] let the enemy attempt to thwart our
[1:04:45] service to the lord our reply is
[1:04:47] increased service
[1:04:49] when the faint are crying in fear that
[1:04:51] is the time to shout them
[1:05:07] let me try to do that
[1:05:08] our employees increase the services amen
[1:05:12] when the faith are climbed in fear
[1:05:14] that's the time to shout the victory
[1:05:17] hallelujah
[1:05:19] you remember that time when gideon was
[1:05:21] taken meant for war what i told him to
[1:05:24] tell all the fearful to go back at home
[1:05:27] so now right now when the enemy is
[1:05:29] trying to remove people from going to
[1:05:31] churches
[1:05:33] look our service has even increased the
[1:05:35] more
[1:05:36] however yeah we are going to have more
[1:05:38] services that we usually do
[1:05:41] how are they supposed to be
[1:05:43] to the living god hallelujah
[1:05:45] yes
[1:05:46] let them cry in fear but for us it's our
[1:05:48] time to
[1:05:59] i know thy works
[1:06:01] and the last to be more than the first
[1:06:04] now as we have already said
[1:06:06] this age is called the dark ages because
[1:06:09] it was indeed the darkest period of all
[1:06:11] history
[1:06:12] it was the age of pope innocent iii
[1:06:15] who claimed that he was the vicar of
[1:06:17] christ
[1:06:18] supreme sovereign over the church and
[1:06:20] the world
[1:06:21] who instituted the inquisition
[1:06:23] which under his direction shed more
[1:06:25] blood than at any other time except in
[1:06:27] the reformation
[1:06:28] it was the age of pornocracy the rule of
[1:06:31] harlots
[1:06:32] sargarius iii had a mistress and filled
[1:06:35] the papal choir with paramours and
[1:06:37] bastard sons and turned the papal palace
[1:06:39] into a den of robbers
[1:06:41] anastasius the third was smothered to
[1:06:43] death by morogia who was mistress to
[1:06:45] sargeras
[1:06:47] john the eleventh was morocia's
[1:06:48] illegitimate son
[1:06:50] john the twelfth was the grandson of
[1:06:51] morocia and he
[1:06:53] violated widows and virgins and was
[1:06:55] killed while in the act of adultery by
[1:06:57] the woman's enraged husband
[1:07:00] it was the age of papal schism for two
[1:07:02] lines of popes one ruling from avignon
[1:07:05] and the other from rome cursed and
[1:07:07] fought each other
[1:07:08] these popes were not only guilty of
[1:07:10] immoral sex acts fathering scores of
[1:07:12] illegitimate children committing sodomy
[1:07:14] etc but were guilty of selling priestly
[1:07:17] offices to the highest bidders
[1:07:20] it was the age when the light glowed
[1:07:21] ever so faintly yet the few believers
[1:07:24] labored more fervently as the darkness
[1:07:26] increased until toward the end of the
[1:07:28] age many arose attempting reforms
[1:07:31] their labors were so fervent but they
[1:07:33] paved the way for the oncoming
[1:07:35] reformation
[1:07:36] therefore as the word says concerning
[1:07:38] that age
[1:07:39] your
[1:07:40] last end of the age works are more than
[1:07:44] the first
[1:07:45] the word thyatira has various meanings
[1:07:47] amongst which is continual sacrifice
[1:07:50] by many this is believed to be a
[1:07:51] prophecy concerning the use of the mass
[1:07:53] which is a continual presentation of the
[1:07:55] sacrifice of christ
[1:07:57] that is an excellent thought
[1:07:59] but it might also mean the continual
[1:08:01] sacrifice in lives and labors of the
[1:08:02] true believers of the lord
[1:08:05] surely these styetarian saints were the
[1:08:07] cream of the crop full of the holy ghost
[1:08:10] and faith created unto good works
[1:08:12] showing forth his praise holding not
[1:08:14] their lives dear unto themselves but
[1:08:17] gladly giving their all as a sweet
[1:08:19] sacrifice unto the lord
[1:08:22] the rebuke
[1:08:24] revelation 2 20
[1:08:27] notwithstanding i have a few things
[1:08:29] against thee because thou sufferest
[1:08:31] tolerate that woman jezebel which
[1:08:34] calleth herself a prophetess to teach
[1:08:36] and to seduce my servants to commit
[1:08:38] fornication and to eat things sacrificed
[1:08:40] to idols
[1:08:42] now with this verse i want you to drop
[1:08:44] down to verse 23 and see the proof of a
[1:08:46] great truth i have been bringing to your
[1:08:48] attention all along
[1:08:50] and i will kill her children with death
[1:08:53] and all the churches shall know that i
[1:08:55] am he which searcheth the reigns and
[1:08:56] hearts
[1:08:58] i have been saying right along that
[1:09:00] there are actually two churches though
[1:09:03] the spirit speaks to both of them in
[1:09:04] each age as though they were but one
[1:09:07] here it is plainly stated that there are
[1:09:09] churches and it states just as plainly
[1:09:12] that some of these churches most
[1:09:13] evidently do not know that he is the one
[1:09:15] who searcheth the reigns and the hearts
[1:09:18] he is going to prove to them that is so
[1:09:21] now then what churches will be those
[1:09:23] that do not know this truth
[1:09:25] of course it is the false vine group
[1:09:28] because the true believers certainly
[1:09:29] know that judgment begins at the house
[1:09:31] of god and they being god fearing judge
[1:09:34] themselves that they be not judged
[1:09:37] now why does god call these churches his
[1:09:40] have you seen that yes
[1:09:42] he says now
[1:09:44] then
[1:09:46] yesterday
[1:09:52] okay
[1:09:55] it says he's going to prove to them
[1:09:58] now then
[1:10:00] what churches will be
[1:10:03] those that do not know this truth
[1:10:05] because it is the first fine group
[1:10:07] because the true believers certainly
[1:10:09] know
[1:10:11] that judgment
[1:10:13] begins
[1:10:17] [Music]
[1:10:23] they judge themselves
[1:10:25] that they've been object
[1:10:27] so you judge yourself now so that when
[1:10:31] he comes you are not jacked
[1:10:34] you see that's what we are as believers
[1:10:37] we know judgment is coming even those
[1:10:38] who are refusing to judge themselves now
[1:10:40] there is a day coming
[1:10:42] we've seen that sometimes there's a sad
[1:10:45] day coming a saturday coming there's a
[1:10:49] saturday coming by and by do you have
[1:10:52] the ones with the sunrise
[1:10:54] where all those ones who rejected the
[1:10:56] lord you know when they are going to
[1:10:58] their reward when they are going to the
[1:11:01] judgment at that time
[1:11:02] oh there's a saturday coming by and by
[1:11:08] you know
[1:11:09] but also it is a happy day for us
[1:11:12] it's a it's a happy day
[1:11:15] saturday for them happy day for those
[1:11:16] who would have already judged themselves
[1:11:18] today you preach something and someone
[1:11:21] says don't judge me don't judge me and
[1:11:24] then you know they say don't judge me
[1:11:26] now
[1:11:27] but don't worry if you don't want
[1:11:28] judgment now you will get another time
[1:11:30] that's right me when someone say don't
[1:11:31] judge me leave them alone i don't say
[1:11:33] anything else after that
[1:11:35] since that you're wearing a mini skirt
[1:11:36] don't judge me
[1:11:38] okay fine because you can buy it will
[1:11:40] give me this car no problem
[1:11:42] but there is a day where you will be
[1:11:45] judged if you have refused this judgment
[1:11:47] now that day you will not be able to
[1:11:50] escape
[1:11:51] that judgment how did
[1:11:55] what are we encouraging our people what
[1:11:57] are we encouraging you sisters and
[1:11:59] brothers
[1:12:00] we are encouraging you to overcome
[1:12:04] this kind of feeling that don't judge me
[1:12:19] allow christ to put you in order i allow
[1:12:21] the world to shape you you know you are
[1:12:23] just the great you know he is the porter
[1:12:26] you are the great hallelujah so i am the
[1:12:29] porter i am the clay you are the porter
[1:12:32] you know the song
[1:12:33] how does it go
[1:12:37] [Music]
[1:13:06] me
[1:13:15] [Applause]
[1:13:19] [Music]
[1:13:26] one more time
[1:13:47] i
[1:13:49] am
[1:13:59] [Music]
[1:14:06] oh
[1:14:07] [Applause]
[1:14:22] you should allow him to mold you the way
[1:14:24] he wants to mold you do not dare say
[1:14:27] that he's judging me don't judge me you
[1:14:28] know it's a religion of old people blah
[1:14:30] blah blah blah okay go ahead but don't
[1:14:33] worry there is a day coming did you hear
[1:14:35] that chorus of the uh they said they
[1:14:37] coming
[1:14:39] there's a day coming something like that
[1:14:40] did you get a first yes or no no all
[1:14:42] right
[1:14:44] you you can see if you can get it's a
[1:14:45] very very good one for some people
[1:14:47] really yeah i wish you you'll get those
[1:14:50] words it's very very good for us to sing
[1:14:52] it or for us to see the ones so that
[1:14:54] know how serious this thing is you know
[1:14:56] that day is coming and it is coming but
[1:14:59] you will you have the chance now
[1:15:01] when we have the chance now let us get
[1:15:03] yielded to him
[1:15:05] fully so that you can judge us now
[1:15:07] that judgment begins at the house of god
[1:15:10] and they being good fearing they judge
[1:15:12] themselves that they've been object and
[1:15:14] you know when you let yourself you don't
[1:15:16] need anyone to judge you because you're
[1:15:18] already standing right
[1:15:19] hard anyways
[1:15:21] amen shall we now continue
[1:15:23] [Music]
[1:15:32] okay
[1:15:33] i think we're just transferring now
[1:15:37] now why does god call these churches his
[1:15:39] churches even though they are the false
[1:15:41] vine
[1:15:42] the truth of the matter is that they are
[1:15:44] christians
[1:15:45] but they are not christians of the
[1:15:46] spirit
[1:15:48] they are christians of the flesh
[1:15:50] they are bearing the name in vain
[1:15:52] mark 7 7.
[1:15:54] how be it in vain do they worship me
[1:15:56] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[1:15:58] of men
[1:16:00] but indeed they are christians for what
[1:16:01] else could they be
[1:16:03] a is a
[1:16:05] that is his religion no matter how he
[1:16:07] lives it because he subscribes in theory
[1:16:09] to what the quran teaches
[1:16:11] in the same way a christian is a
[1:16:13] christian as long as he subscribes to
[1:16:15] the fact that jesus is the son of god
[1:16:18] born of a virgin was crucified and died
[1:16:20] and rose again
[1:16:22] that he is the savior of mankind etc
[1:16:25] in fact in the laodicean age there will
[1:16:28] be those who call themselves christians
[1:16:30] because they subscribe to the fine
[1:16:31] qualities of jesus while reserving to
[1:16:33] themselves the right to deny his deity
[1:16:36] christian scientists have done that
[1:16:38] already as well as multitudes who preach
[1:16:40] a social gospel
[1:16:42] he is a nominal christian and belongs to
[1:16:44] the church
[1:16:46] but he is not a true or spiritual
[1:16:48] believer
[1:16:49] that kind of a believer is one who has
[1:16:50] been baptized into the body of christ
[1:16:52] and is a member of him
[1:16:54] but nonetheless
[1:16:56] it is in god's order that the tears grow
[1:16:58] up with the weed and they are not to be
[1:17:00] uprooted
[1:17:01] that is the command of god
[1:17:03] their day for binding and burning is
[1:17:05] coming but not yet
[1:17:08] so the spirit is speaking to this mixed
[1:17:10] group
[1:17:10] on the one hand he is praising and on
[1:17:12] the other he is rebuking
[1:17:14] he has told what is right with the true
[1:17:16] believer
[1:17:17] now he warns what the false vine must do
[1:17:19] if it is to stand justified before the
[1:17:21] lord
[1:17:24] that woman jezebel
[1:17:27] the apostle james showed us the course
[1:17:29] that sin takes
[1:17:31] james 1 14-15
[1:17:34] but every man is tempted when he is
[1:17:35] drawn away of his own lust and enticed
[1:17:39] then when lust hath conceived it
[1:17:41] bringeth forth sin and sin when it is
[1:17:43] finished bringeth forth death
[1:17:46] now that is a picture of exactly what is
[1:17:48] happening in the church ages
[1:17:50] as sin started in nothing but a feeling
[1:17:53] so the death to the church started with
[1:17:54] the simple little notice deeds of the
[1:17:56] nicolaitans
[1:17:58] from the deeds it went to a doctrine
[1:18:00] from the doctrine it embraced the power
[1:18:02] of the state and the introduction of
[1:18:04] paganism
[1:18:05] now in this age it goes to its own
[1:18:07] prophetess teacher and so it travels on
[1:18:10] until it will find itself in the lake of
[1:18:12] fire for that is exactly where it is
[1:18:14] going to end up in the second death
[1:18:18] now the whole cry of god against this
[1:18:20] fourth age is found in his denunciation
[1:18:22] of this prophetess jezebel and to
[1:18:25] understand exactly why he denounces her
[1:18:27] so we will have to look up her history
[1:18:29] in the bible and when we find what she
[1:18:32] did back there we will know what is
[1:18:33] going on at this time
[1:18:36] the first and very important thing that
[1:18:38] we learn about jezebel is that she is
[1:18:40] not a daughter of abraham nor is her
[1:18:43] induction into the tribes of israel one
[1:18:45] of spiritual admission as was that of
[1:18:47] ruth the moabitess
[1:18:49] no sir
[1:18:50] this woman was the daughter of ethbail
[1:18:54] first kings 1631
[1:18:57] who was the priest unto astarte
[1:19:00] he had gained the throne by murdering
[1:19:01] his predecessor feliz
[1:19:03] so we see right away that she was the
[1:19:05] daughter of a murderer this certainly
[1:19:08] reminds us of kane
[1:19:10] and the way she became a part of israel
[1:19:12] was not through the spiritual channels
[1:19:13] that god had ordained for gentile
[1:19:15] admission
[1:19:16] but she came in by marriage to ahab the
[1:19:19] king of the ten tribes of israel
[1:19:22] now this union as we have seen was not
[1:19:24] spiritual it was political
[1:19:27] and so this woman who was steeped in
[1:19:28] idolatry did not have the least desire
[1:19:30] to become a worshiper of the one true
[1:19:32] god
[1:19:33] but rather she came with the avowed
[1:19:35] intentions of turning israel away from
[1:19:37] the lord
[1:19:39] now israel the ten tribes had already
[1:19:41] known what it was to worship the golden
[1:19:44] calves but as yet they were not sold out
[1:19:46] to idolatry for god was worshiped and
[1:19:49] the law of moses was acknowledged
[1:19:51] but from the time of ahab's marriage to
[1:19:53] jezebel idolatry progressed in a deadly
[1:19:56] fashion
[1:19:57] it was when this woman became a
[1:19:59] priestess in the temples that she
[1:20:01] erected to astarte
[1:20:02] venus and baal
[1:20:04] sun god that israel came to the crisis
[1:20:07] point of her life
[1:20:09] with this in mind we can now begin to
[1:20:11] see what the spirit of god is setting
[1:20:13] forth in this dietary and age
[1:20:15] here it is
[1:20:17] ahab married jezebel and he did it as a
[1:20:19] political maneuver to strengthen his
[1:20:21] kingdom and secure it
[1:20:23] that is exactly what the church did when
[1:20:25] it married under constantine
[1:20:27] they both got together for political
[1:20:29] reasons though they put a spiritual heir
[1:20:31] to it
[1:20:33] now no one can convince me that
[1:20:34] constantine was a christian
[1:20:36] he was a pagan with what looked like
[1:20:38] christian trappings he painted white
[1:20:40] crosses on the soldiers shields
[1:20:43] he was the originator of the knights of
[1:20:44] columbus he put a cross on the steeple
[1:20:47] of saint sophia's thereby starting a
[1:20:49] tradition
[1:20:51] it was constantine's idea to get
[1:20:53] everyone together the pagans nominal
[1:20:55] christians and true christians
[1:20:57] and for a while it looked as if he would
[1:20:59] succeed for the real believers came
[1:21:01] along to see if they could bring back
[1:21:02] the ones that had drifted away from the
[1:21:04] word
[1:21:05] when they saw that they couldn't bring
[1:21:07] them back into the truth
[1:21:09] they were forced to break away from the
[1:21:10] body political
[1:21:12] then when they did they were called
[1:21:13] heretics and persecuted
[1:21:16] let me say right here that we have the
[1:21:18] very same thing going on right now
[1:21:21] the people are all coming together
[1:21:23] they are writing a bible that will suit
[1:21:25] everyone whether it be a jew catholic or
[1:21:27] protestant
[1:21:28] they have their own nicene council but
[1:21:31] they call it the ecumenical council
[1:21:34] and do you know whom all these
[1:21:36] organizations fight they fight the true
[1:21:38] pentecostals i don't mean the
[1:21:40] organization called pentecostal
[1:21:42] i mean the ones who are pentecostal
[1:21:44] because they are filled with the holy
[1:21:46] ghost and have the signs and gifts in
[1:21:48] their midst because they walk in truth
[1:21:51] when ahab married jezebel for political
[1:21:53] reasons he sold his birthright you join
[1:21:56] up with an organization and you sell
[1:21:58] your birthright brother whether you want
[1:22:00] to believe it or not
[1:22:01] every protestant group that ever came
[1:22:03] out and then went back sold their
[1:22:05] birthright
[1:22:06] and when you sell your birthright you're
[1:22:08] just like esau you can cry and repent
[1:22:11] all you want but it won't do you any
[1:22:13] good
[1:22:14] there is only one thing you can do and
[1:22:16] that is
[1:22:17] come out of her my people and stop
[1:22:19] partaking of her sins
[1:22:21] now if you don't think i am right just
[1:22:23] answer this one question
[1:22:25] can any man living tell me what church
[1:22:27] or what move of god ever had revival and
[1:22:30] came back after she went into
[1:22:32] organization and became a denomination
[1:22:34] read your histories
[1:22:36] you can't find one
[1:22:37] not even one
[1:22:40] it was the midnight hour for israel when
[1:22:42] she joined with the world and left the
[1:22:44] spiritual for the political
[1:22:46] it was the midnight hour at nicea when
[1:22:48] the church did the same thing
[1:22:50] it is the midnight hour now that the
[1:22:52] churches are coming together
[1:22:55] now when they have married jezebel he
[1:22:57] allowed her to take the state money and
[1:22:58] erect two huge houses of worship of
[1:23:00] astarte and baal
[1:23:02] the one that was erected for baal was
[1:23:04] big enough for all israel to come and
[1:23:06] worship there at
[1:23:08] and when constantine and the church
[1:23:09] married he gave the church buildings and
[1:23:12] set up altars and images and organized
[1:23:14] the hierarchy that had already been
[1:23:16] shaping up
[1:23:18] when jezebel got the power of the state
[1:23:20] behind her she forced her religion on
[1:23:22] the people and killed the prophets and
[1:23:24] priests of god
[1:23:26] it got so bad that elijah the messenger
[1:23:28] to his day
[1:23:30] thought he was the only one left
[1:23:32] but god had seven thousand more that
[1:23:34] hadn't bowed the knee to baal
[1:23:36] and right now out there amongst those
[1:23:38] denominations of baptists methodists
[1:23:41] presbyterians etc
[1:23:43] there are some that will come out and
[1:23:44] come back to god
[1:23:46] i want you to know i am not now and
[1:23:49] never have been against the people it is
[1:23:51] the denomination
[1:23:53] the system of organization that i am
[1:23:55] against
[1:23:56] i have to be against it for god hates it
[1:24:00] now just let us stop a minute here and
[1:24:01] rehearse what we brought out about the
[1:24:03] worship in thyatira
[1:24:05] i said that they worshipped apollo who
[1:24:07] was the sun god along with the emperor
[1:24:11] now this apollo was called the averter
[1:24:13] of evil he turned evil away from people
[1:24:16] he blessed them and was a real god to
[1:24:18] them
[1:24:19] he was supposed to teach the people he
[1:24:21] explained about worship and temple
[1:24:23] rights services to gods about sacrifices
[1:24:26] and death and life after death
[1:24:29] the way he did this was through a
[1:24:30] prophetess who sat entranced upon a
[1:24:32] tripod chair
[1:24:34] my
[1:24:34] do you see it here is that prophetess
[1:24:37] called jezebel and she is teaching the
[1:24:38] people
[1:24:40] and her teaching is seducing the
[1:24:41] servants of god and causing them to
[1:24:43] commit fornication
[1:24:45] now fornication means idol worship
[1:24:48] that is what its spiritual meaning is
[1:24:50] it is an illegal union ahab's union and
[1:24:53] constantine's union were both illegal
[1:24:56] both committed spiritual fornication
[1:24:58] every fornicator will wind up in the
[1:25:00] lake of fire god said so
[1:25:04] now
[1:25:24] you did not follow that
[1:25:27] what is your fortification
[1:25:31] what is that
[1:25:52] okay
[1:26:06] it is
[1:26:20] instead of the word of god that is very
[1:26:22] true that is spiritual for education an
[1:26:25] illegal union
[1:26:27] where the church united
[1:26:30] in the wrong way
[1:26:31] you know like he's showing you that
[1:26:34] i was the king yeah yes
[1:26:36] i
[1:26:37] went into a wrong union
[1:26:40] uh with a jezebel
[1:26:42] and jezebel caused the people to commit
[1:26:45] spiritual fornication
[1:26:47] by killing all the prophets of god and
[1:26:48] bringing the foreign gods of
[1:26:52] the rest from his people
[1:26:54] and from heart from our people from the
[1:26:56] people that where she came from
[1:26:58] and we also find that the same thing
[1:27:00] that uh constantine did constantine was
[1:27:03] an emperor an emperor in rome
[1:27:06] you remember in a pegamon
[1:27:09] he called a
[1:27:10] the he convinced a council called the
[1:27:13] city council
[1:27:14] and in the silicon so emperor
[1:27:16] constantine was able to gather the
[1:27:18] people together bring them together and
[1:27:21] uh cause them to believe
[1:27:24] in the one god one world ago
[1:27:26] and
[1:27:27] that kind of union
[1:27:29] was
[1:27:30] was spiritual fornication because they
[1:27:32] left the way of god and they went into
[1:27:34] the way of man because sooner or later
[1:27:36] of course we see that in this particular
[1:27:38] church age where the man speaks of
[1:27:41] this foe
[1:27:42] that uh
[1:27:43] rose up and at this time you know he
[1:27:45] said well he is the one who is the vicar
[1:27:48] of christ
[1:27:49] he actually talked about him what's the
[1:27:51] name of that pope if you've been
[1:27:52] following
[1:27:54] has someone noted that somewhere
[1:27:58] yes
[1:28:00] which pen is that
[1:28:03] two to five
[1:28:05] okay what what does it say
[1:28:12] okay
[1:28:13] i think uh you can look at it from uh
[1:28:16] two to four way
[1:28:18] where he says that uh now as we have
[1:28:20] already said this age is called the dark
[1:28:22] ages because it was indeed a darkest
[1:28:25] period of all history all right and then
[1:28:29] he says that
[1:28:30] it was the age of the pope
[1:28:32] uh
[1:28:34] who claimed that he was the vicar of
[1:28:37] christ macaulay is fairly gay
[1:28:40] so-called supreme suffering over the
[1:28:43] church and the world
[1:28:44] who instituted the inquisition which
[1:28:46] under his direction shed more blood than
[1:28:49] at any other time except in the
[1:28:51] reformation it was the age of the
[1:28:54] prophecy the rule of alex
[1:28:57] sargarius the third had a mysteries and
[1:29:00] filled the purple choir with the
[1:29:02] paramores and bastard sons and turned
[1:29:04] the purple palace into a dead robot
[1:29:07] and actually much later on you know of
[1:29:09] course it became a team of robbers that
[1:29:11] uh martin luther himself does speak
[1:29:13] about it actually i have a a little bit
[1:29:16] a few books of mathematica here a few
[1:29:18] letters that matter wrote to
[1:29:21] uh for player okay much later on after
[1:29:24] the uh this pop
[1:29:27] uh what's the name of the sport
[1:29:30] you know probably okay much later but
[1:29:33] also uh
[1:29:34] you know
[1:29:36] in the same way
[1:29:37] they were not different they were not
[1:29:38] different at all and i i want to see if
[1:29:41] i can be able to get
[1:29:42] some of these
[1:29:44] books here that i have
[1:29:47] and i read for you some of the letters
[1:29:49] that uh martin luther wrote and he sent
[1:29:53] to pope leo you know matt luna was uh
[1:29:55] the messenger that comes as a fifth
[1:29:58] church eight messenger you know what's
[1:30:00] the fifth church age called
[1:30:03] what is it
[1:30:11] [Music]
[1:30:14] is
[1:30:31] can someone tell me something
[1:30:37] oh after this after they said i'm going
[1:30:39] to ask serious questions
[1:30:41] serious questions yes
[1:30:59] felt very sick
[1:31:15] is that true
[1:31:22] who says it is true
[1:31:26] [Music]
[1:31:28] so some of you don't even know whether
[1:31:29] it is true or not
[1:31:31] and your business having this together
[1:31:32] guys
[1:31:36] so where have you been
[1:31:38] do you have your first exams in glass
[1:31:39] don't you
[1:31:41] this is a study
[1:31:45] you read that
[1:31:46] but you have been reading here seriously
[1:31:49] okay can someone tell you something
[1:31:50] about martin
[1:31:53] and who was wanted to begin with brother
[1:32:21] is
[1:32:24] [Music]
[1:32:38] [Music]
[1:33:03] [Music]
[1:33:05] they get
[1:33:42] [Music]
[1:33:48] you
[1:33:52] he could not try to avoid him anymore
[1:33:54] yes such men of god who have the power
[1:33:57] of god moving in them hallelujah that's
[1:33:59] the kind of man we are looking up to you
[1:34:01] know even in this house where are those
[1:34:03] men and women
[1:34:04] that will remove the heart of god
[1:34:05] hallelujah
[1:34:07] amen even when your enemy is against you
[1:34:09] and you need to talk to them and they
[1:34:11] try to lock their doors
[1:34:13] in those doors
[1:34:14] amen
[1:34:27] all right and then again now we see here
[1:34:30] i wanted to share something with you
[1:34:31] that is really very very special special
[1:34:34] uh the letters one of the letters of uh
[1:34:37] rudolph maturuta was the age of
[1:34:39] messenger that comes much later in the
[1:34:42] uh in the church
[1:34:53] so we see that in in studies
[1:34:56] god continues we see that the things are
[1:34:58] really starting down here in that era
[1:35:00] when when uh innocent that poor the
[1:35:04] third
[1:35:05] the pop of rome at that time you know he
[1:35:07] kind of
[1:35:08] advances here he feel the purple choir
[1:35:11] these sagaris the third the purple choir
[1:35:14] with barometers and powerful sons and
[1:35:16] turn their palace a paper palace into a
[1:35:18] hell of robots but we see
[1:35:21] even the catholic church itself did not
[1:35:23] become the way it were it is today
[1:35:26] immediately nothing went on windowing by
[1:35:30] little small by small over the years so
[1:35:32] by the time of martin luther
[1:35:35] they were decaying rotten
[1:35:37] rotted
[1:35:38] okay rotten
[1:35:40] initially they thought they were doing
[1:35:40] something for the lord but of course the
[1:35:42] way inspired by the devil that's why we
[1:35:44] always have to look out for things which
[1:35:45] seem to be wrong as much as the people
[1:35:48] might have the right or the best of
[1:35:50] intentions
[1:35:51] you may have the best of an injection
[1:35:53] that's organized let's do something else
[1:35:56] is god in that way it's not moving you
[1:35:58] that way is it in the word of god or is
[1:36:01] it uh your desire you might have the
[1:36:04] best intentions to suffer but if
[1:36:06] something is anti-war then it is that
[1:36:08] the christ yes so these people organized
[1:36:10] and he was under the word what they were
[1:36:12] doing to put a man there to lead the
[1:36:14] whole church to the satisfaction of
[1:36:15] christ
[1:36:16] and by the way they only organized the
[1:36:18] bishops which were the two bishops
[1:36:20] they lost their organized
[1:36:22] and of course the others rejected that
[1:36:24] idea but others continue with that idea
[1:36:26] and of course the ones which rejected
[1:36:28] the idea we read of them here how he is
[1:36:30] talking about their works
[1:36:32] those believers
[1:36:34] but we see in this age there are those
[1:36:36] that
[1:36:40] and
[1:36:41] once the prophecy was formed then there
[1:36:43] is one man who is speaking on behalf of
[1:36:45] god apparently imagine one might speak
[1:36:48] on behalf of god everybody else has to
[1:36:50] listen
[1:36:56] of christ this is what it means to be
[1:36:57] the league of press
[1:36:59] the vicar is instead of his day twice he
[1:37:03] is there
[1:37:04] a sister is the
[1:37:07] vice president he is the
[1:37:09] next in command you understand when the
[1:37:11] other is not around you will you finish
[1:37:13] up everything so in other words he made
[1:37:15] and he called himself the device of
[1:37:17] christ the assistant of christ what a
[1:37:20] blessed feeling
[1:37:24] and i want you to see
[1:37:26] what this man is saying
[1:37:29] who was a priest in this very system
[1:37:32] much later on of course
[1:37:33] he was raised in that system and he
[1:37:35] became a priest but here are some of
[1:37:36] these words there are very many words
[1:37:38] that he speaks but uh
[1:37:41] i'll wait for you just a little bit
[1:37:44] i have a very big book here
[1:37:46] okay says
[1:37:48] i don't even know i don't i don't even
[1:37:50] know what to begin
[1:37:53] to begin from but let me begin
[1:37:55] even though a miracle were to be done in
[1:37:57] the pope's behalf against the temple
[1:37:59] powers or though someone were mistreated
[1:38:03] with a blade which they must have
[1:38:05] sometimes happened it should be
[1:38:07] considered only the work of the devil
[1:38:10] because of the weakness of faith of our
[1:38:12] faith in god he is a priest
[1:38:15] psychotherapist writing today before
[1:38:18] writing to apollo
[1:38:19] and he's telling him there is no
[1:38:21] miracles there is no power of god here
[1:38:23] even if america was gonna happen it is
[1:38:25] done by them
[1:38:28] because of the weakness of our faith in
[1:38:30] god christ himself prophesied in matthew
[1:38:33] there shall come in my name first christ
[1:38:35] and first prophets
[1:38:37] and blue citizens and so this is the
[1:38:39] better here and paul says in the second
[1:38:41] thessalonians the
[1:38:43] truth that articles
[1:38:46] through the power of saturn being mighty
[1:38:48] in lying wonders
[1:38:50] there instead of hold first to this no
[1:38:52] christian authority can do anything
[1:38:54] against christ as saint paul says we can
[1:38:56] do that against christ but for christ
[1:38:59] whatever that's called against christ is
[1:39:01] the power of antichrist and of the devil
[1:39:04] and even though it were to reign and
[1:39:05] again one doesn't play one thousand
[1:39:08] plagues broke nothing
[1:39:09] especially in these last evil times
[1:39:12] through which all the scriptures
[1:39:13] prophesy first wonders therefore we must
[1:39:15] live with the firm faith to the words of
[1:39:18] god and then the devil sees from the
[1:39:21] from wonders can you imagine that this
[1:39:22] is a man that actually was a was able to
[1:39:26] preach his faith his message was the
[1:39:28] gesture live
[1:39:29] so when i read these messages oh he's
[1:39:31] late i'm actually reading the message
[1:39:35] because this is one of the messengers of
[1:39:37] the chat agent
[1:39:38] and
[1:39:42] actually if you really want to
[1:39:43] understand faith
[1:39:45] read the words of the leaders of the the
[1:39:47] the preachings of muslim rule
[1:39:49] you can fight for the internet find it
[1:39:51] read it
[1:39:52] he
[1:39:57] faith in christ faith in christ that was
[1:40:00] the revelation of the hour
[1:40:02] not in the church but in christ i wait
[1:40:04] for you to do more thus i hope he's
[1:40:07] writing to the top remember i hope that
[1:40:09] the fourth line terror with which the
[1:40:11] romans have this long time made our
[1:40:13] course just timid and stupid
[1:40:15] has been elected
[1:40:17] they like all of us are subject to the
[1:40:19] temple sword they have no power to
[1:40:21] interpret the scriptures by mere
[1:40:23] authority without learning they have no
[1:40:25] authority to prevent a cancer
[1:40:27] or a sheer woundedness to pledge it and
[1:40:30] bind it or take away slavery but if they
[1:40:32] do this they are in the truth of the
[1:40:34] communion of the antichrist and the
[1:40:36] devil
[1:40:37] and have nothing at all of course except
[1:40:40] the name
[1:40:42] and then he continues on
[1:40:44] our views to be discussing consciousness
[1:40:45] we shall now look at the matters which
[1:40:47] should be discussed in the councils and
[1:40:49] we wish popes cardinals bishops
[1:40:53] and all the scholars ought properly to
[1:40:55] be occupied day and night if they love
[1:40:57] christ and his church but if they
[1:40:59] neglect this duty then let the lighting
[1:41:02] the people the believers
[1:41:17] he was a german remember
[1:41:19] and fear god brothers and men that we
[1:41:21] may not share the faith of all the
[1:41:23] people so of the other apostles who are
[1:41:26] solamentably lordship through the
[1:41:29] shameful and involved rules
[1:41:45] grow is
[1:41:46] meaning that the rule that the rule of
[1:41:49] pop of wrong
[1:41:51] the rule of uh
[1:41:53] of wrong was hell bound health taking
[1:41:55] people to hell and he's saying it cannot
[1:41:57] grow but meaning it has already seen
[1:41:59] highest level of the u.s
[1:42:01] and this was a priest in this system
[1:42:05] i think that he can never
[1:42:07] conceive no not believe
[1:42:09] and then he says it is a horrible and
[1:42:11] frightful thing that the ruler of the
[1:42:13] christendom who boasts himself as the
[1:42:15] vicar of christ
[1:42:17] and successor of saint peter lives in
[1:42:19] such a worldly splendor in his regard no
[1:42:22] king no ever can people or approach him
[1:42:24] and that he who claims the title of most
[1:42:27] horror and my spiritual is more worldly
[1:42:30] than the world itself
[1:42:33] he wears a triple crown when the
[1:42:36] greatest kings wear about a single crown
[1:42:40] if that is a likely property of christ
[1:42:42] and of saved peter then it is a if
[1:42:45] if that is like the prophet of christ
[1:42:48] and of saint peter then it is a new kind
[1:42:50] of likeness when a word is saved against
[1:42:53] it
[1:42:54] they cry out jealousy
[1:42:56] meaning when you say something against
[1:42:57] the catholic church they will say it is
[1:43:00] a harass that man is healthy let us back
[1:43:02] him
[1:43:03] so
[1:43:04] when i was they said i guess you're
[1:43:06] saying
[1:43:07] whatever they cry out firstly
[1:43:09] but that is because they do not wish to
[1:43:11] hear how unchristian and how ungodly
[1:43:15] such a practice is
[1:43:17] oh man talk about a man who is standing
[1:43:20] for god faith in christ
[1:43:23] i think however that if the pope were
[1:43:26] with the king with the tears to pray to
[1:43:29] god
[1:43:30] killing the pope doesn't even have he's
[1:43:32] not even halfway up he has the prayer of
[1:43:34] god i'm telling you this man
[1:43:36] whoever you have never heard of them i
[1:43:38] think however that if the pope were with
[1:43:41] the three has to pray to god he would
[1:43:42] have to lay aside these crowns
[1:43:45] for our god can suffer no praying and
[1:43:47] using office is nothing else at least
[1:43:50] they need to week and pray for
[1:43:52] christendom
[1:43:53] meaning
[1:43:54] the office of the prophet should be over
[1:43:56] such a man who says that is on behalf of
[1:43:58] god
[1:43:59] on god of christ his office should be
[1:44:01] there to always cry for the sins of the
[1:44:04] people right before god right like jesus
[1:44:06] was doing right
[1:44:08] but he's saying he if he would do that
[1:44:10] if he hadn't even idea to play fast he
[1:44:12] would have to first put down his triple
[1:44:13] crown he had a one of the with
[1:44:16] with his people you know a triple crown
[1:44:18] with three
[1:44:28] this is a man
[1:44:30] who
[1:44:31] there are many many words he spoke here
[1:44:33] i wish i had the time to read for that
[1:44:35] review there more
[1:44:37] and he spoke very very interesting
[1:44:39] things and uh i really always find it uh
[1:44:43] quite uh
[1:44:46] quite amazing the way he
[1:44:49] uh relays these words
[1:44:51] uh
[1:44:53] all right let me read for you this
[1:44:55] for my part i will openly confess that i
[1:44:58] know i have only good and
[1:44:59] vulnerable things of thee whenever i
[1:45:02] have made mention of thy name meaning
[1:45:03] problem and if i have done otherwise i
[1:45:06] myself meaning meaningless
[1:45:09] by no means approve of it but would
[1:45:11] entirely approve the judgment
[1:45:13] others are fond of me and do nothing
[1:45:15] more gladly than we can't search
[1:45:17] russians and the empire children on my
[1:45:19] part i have but i'm saying that this man
[1:45:22] was considered to be the messenger and
[1:45:25] so not because he was able to stand for
[1:45:27] the truth but he was also able to stop
[1:45:29] to be sober
[1:45:31] among us the fanatics you know they
[1:45:32] found that he's the ones who went
[1:45:34] overboard with what he was teaching you
[1:45:36] can hear you can see how he's
[1:45:37] disclaiming that some people were
[1:45:40] writing things
[1:45:42] and doing things which he never told
[1:45:43] them to do apparently but i hate to talk
[1:45:46] about the pope and the roman reigns
[1:45:51] itself by this by thy sea
[1:45:54] which is called the roman career and
[1:45:56] which neither thou nor any man can deny
[1:45:59] that it is more corrupt than any babylon
[1:46:02] or sodom ever was and which is as far as
[1:46:05] i can see characterized by our totally
[1:46:08] brave
[1:46:09] hopeless and notorious weekends
[1:46:13] he's writing to the pope
[1:46:16] and he's a priest
[1:46:18] and by this side they were
[1:46:20] but they were buying them with fight
[1:46:22] but for him he's not he's not feeling
[1:46:25] what they will do to him
[1:46:27] let's see i have truly despised that see
[1:46:29] i appreciate and i have been in sense to
[1:46:32] think that in my thy name and under the
[1:46:35] guise of the roman church the people of
[1:46:37] christ are mocked and so i am resisting
[1:46:40] and will resist that seed
[1:46:43] meaning the vatican as long as the
[1:46:45] spirit of faith shall believe in me
[1:46:47] hallelujah how may i really resist the
[1:46:50] anti-christ doctrine as long as the
[1:46:52] spirit of faith lives in you hallelujah
[1:46:55] you know that's what we ought to do
[1:46:56] there are many many things here that i
[1:46:58] can read for you but let us now go to
[1:46:59] the message of our day
[1:47:02] amen i can see we have a few more
[1:47:05] minutes left
[1:47:06] you can make use
[1:47:14] the teaching of the catholic church the
[1:47:17] church is female it is a woman denies
[1:47:19] the word of god
[1:47:21] the pope who is literally apollo in a
[1:47:23] modern version has taught the people to
[1:47:25] join themselves to idols
[1:47:27] the roman church has now become a false
[1:47:29] prophetess to the people because she has
[1:47:31] taken away the word of the lord from the
[1:47:33] people and given her own ideas as to
[1:47:36] what constitutes forgiveness of sins
[1:47:38] what brings the blessings of god
[1:47:41] and the priests have gone so far as to
[1:47:43] stay categorically but they have power
[1:47:45] not only in life but in death
[1:47:48] they teach on their own that there is a
[1:47:49] purgatory but you can't find that in the
[1:47:52] word
[1:47:53] they teach that prayers and masses and
[1:47:55] money will get you out of purgatory and
[1:47:57] into heaven
[1:47:58] the whole system that is based upon its
[1:48:00] teaching is
[1:48:01] false
[1:48:03] it does not lie on the sure foundation
[1:48:05] of the revelation of god in his word
[1:48:07] but lies on the shifting sinking sands
[1:48:09] of its own diabolical untruths
[1:48:13] the church went right from organization
[1:48:15] to denomination and hence to false
[1:48:17] teaching
[1:48:18] that is right
[1:48:20] the roman catholics don't believe that
[1:48:22] god is in his word
[1:48:24] no sir
[1:48:25] if they did they would have to repent
[1:48:27] and back up but they say god is in his
[1:48:29] church
[1:48:31] that would make the bible the history of
[1:48:32] the catholic church
[1:48:34] that isn't so
[1:48:36] look what they did to water baptism
[1:48:38] alone
[1:48:39] they took it away from being christian
[1:48:40] baptism and made it a pagan one of
[1:48:42] titles
[1:48:43] let me tell you about an experience i
[1:48:45] had with a catholic priest
[1:48:48] a girl that i had baptized at one time
[1:48:50] turned catholic so the priest wanted to
[1:48:52] interview me about her
[1:48:54] he asked what kind of baptism she had
[1:48:57] i told him i baptized her in christian
[1:48:59] baptism which is the only kind there was
[1:49:01] to my knowledge
[1:49:02] i had buried her in water in the name of
[1:49:04] the lord jesus christ
[1:49:06] the priest remarked to me that at one
[1:49:08] time the catholic church did that
[1:49:11] right away i asked him when the catholic
[1:49:13] church did that
[1:49:14] for i have read their histories and i
[1:49:16] could not find what he said
[1:49:18] he told me that it was found in the
[1:49:20] bible and that jesus had organized the
[1:49:22] catholic church
[1:49:24] i asked him if he thought peter was
[1:49:26] really the first pope
[1:49:27] he emphatically said that peter was
[1:49:30] i asked him if the masses were said in
[1:49:32] latin in order to ensure that they were
[1:49:33] correct and would never change
[1:49:36] he said that was true
[1:49:38] i told him that i thought they had
[1:49:39] wandered a long way from what they had
[1:49:41] in the beginning
[1:49:42] i let him know that if the catholic
[1:49:44] church really believed the book of acts
[1:49:46] then i was an old-fashioned catholic
[1:49:49] he told me that the bible was the record
[1:49:51] of the catholic church and that god was
[1:49:53] in the church
[1:49:54] i disagreed with him for god is in his
[1:49:57] word
[1:49:58] let god be true but every man a liar
[1:50:01] if you take away or add to that book god
[1:50:04] has promised that he will add plagues to
[1:50:06] those who add and take away their part
[1:50:08] from the book of life if they dare to
[1:50:10] subtract from it
[1:50:11] revelation 22 18-19
[1:50:15] let me just show how the roman catholic
[1:50:17] church believes that god is in the
[1:50:19] church instead of the word
[1:50:21] here is an excerpt from the diary of
[1:50:22] pope john the twenty third
[1:50:24] my experience during these three years
[1:50:27] as pope since in fear and trembling i
[1:50:29] accepted this service in pure obedience
[1:50:31] to the lord's will conveyed to me
[1:50:33] through the sacred college of cardinals
[1:50:35] and conclave
[1:50:37] bears witness to this maxim and is a
[1:50:39] moving and lasting reason for me to be
[1:50:41] true to it
[1:50:43] absolute trust in god in all that
[1:50:45] concerns the present and perfect
[1:50:46] tranquility as regards the future
[1:50:49] this pope states that god spoke through
[1:50:51] the church revealing his will
[1:50:53] how false
[1:50:55] god is in his word and speaks by the
[1:50:57] word revealing his will
[1:50:59] he also stated that he placed absolute
[1:51:01] trust in the word of men and thereby
[1:51:03] obeyed it with tranquility
[1:51:05] it sounds so beautiful but it is so
[1:51:07] false
[1:51:08] just like the perversion in the garden
[1:51:10] of eden
[1:51:12] now let us get over here in revelation
[1:51:14] 17 and see this woman the church who was
[1:51:16] living on false prophecies and not the
[1:51:18] word of god
[1:51:20] in verse one god calls her the great
[1:51:23] why is she a
[1:51:25] because she is in idolatry
[1:51:27] she has caught the people up into the
[1:51:28] same thing
[1:51:30] what's the cure for idolatry
[1:51:32] the word of god so this woman is a
[1:51:35] because she has left the word
[1:51:37] there she is sitting upon many waters
[1:51:39] which means multitudes of people
[1:51:42] this surely has to be the false church
[1:51:44] because the church of god is small few
[1:51:46] there be that find it
[1:51:49] notice what she is like in the eyes of
[1:51:51] god no matter how wonderful she looks to
[1:51:53] people and how philosophical she sounds
[1:51:55] she is filthy drunk on her fornications
[1:51:59] now she was drunk with the blood of the
[1:52:00] martyrs just like jezebel who killed the
[1:52:03] prophets and priests and destroyed the
[1:52:05] people of god who would not bow down and
[1:52:07] worship baal
[1:52:08] and that is exactly what the catholic
[1:52:10] church did
[1:52:11] they killed those that would not bow
[1:52:13] down to the popish rule
[1:52:15] those who wanted the word of god instead
[1:52:17] of the words of men were put to death
[1:52:19] usually by cruel methods
[1:52:21] but this church that dealt in death was
[1:52:23] dead herself and didn't know it there
[1:52:26] was no life in her and no signs ever
[1:52:28] followed her
[1:52:30] space to repent
[1:52:32] revelation 2 21
[1:52:35] and i gave her space to repent of her
[1:52:37] fornications and she repented not
[1:52:41] do you know that this church was
[1:52:42] actually more wicked than ahab
[1:52:44] do you know that he repented for a while
[1:52:46] and walked softly before god
[1:52:49] you can't say that of the roman catholic
[1:52:51] church no sir
[1:52:52] she has never repented but has
[1:52:54] stubbornly destroyed any and all who
[1:52:56] tried to help her repent that is history
[1:52:59] now god kept raising up not only the
[1:53:01] messengers to each age but he raised up
[1:53:04] some wonderful helpers for those
[1:53:05] messengers
[1:53:07] he gave every age some wonderful men of
[1:53:09] god and they did everything they could
[1:53:11] to bring the church back to god
[1:53:13] god certainly gave her opportunity and
[1:53:15] helped to repent
[1:53:17] did she ever repent and show she did by
[1:53:19] her fruits
[1:53:20] no sir
[1:53:21] she never has and she never will
[1:53:24] she is drunk she has lost her senses in
[1:53:27] spiritual things
[1:53:29] now don't be confused and start thinking
[1:53:31] that the church of rome has repented of
[1:53:33] her slaughter of the saints because she
[1:53:34] is attempting to unite with the
[1:53:36] protestants by making her creeds to line
[1:53:38] up with protestant creeds
[1:53:40] not once has she ever apologized and
[1:53:43] said she was wrong for her mass murders
[1:53:45] and she won't either
[1:53:47] and no matter how mellow and sweet she
[1:53:49] appears at this particular time
[1:53:51] she will yet rise up to kill for murder
[1:53:53] lies in her evil and unrepentant heart
[1:53:58] sentence against the harlot past
[1:54:01] revelation 2 22-23
[1:54:05] behold i will cast her into a bed and
[1:54:07] them that commit adultery with her into
[1:54:09] great tribulation except they repent of
[1:54:11] their deeds
[1:54:12] and i will kill her children with death
[1:54:15] and all the churches shall know that i
[1:54:17] am he which searcheth the reigns and
[1:54:19] hearts and i will give unto every one of
[1:54:21] you according to your works
[1:54:23] what
[1:54:24] this woman has children
[1:54:26] and she a
[1:54:28] if that is the case that she had
[1:54:30] children by her whoredoms then she must
[1:54:31] be burnt with fire as the word has said
[1:54:34] that is exactly true
[1:54:36] that is her end for she will burn with
[1:54:38] fire
[1:54:39] her end is the lake of fire
[1:54:42] but stop and think about these children
[1:54:44] for a moment
[1:54:45] a woman is the one out of whom the
[1:54:47] children come
[1:54:48] it is evident that this woman had
[1:54:50] children that came out of her but they
[1:54:52] did the same thing she did
[1:54:54] show me one church that ever came out of
[1:54:56] organization that didn't go right back
[1:54:58] into it there isn't one not one
[1:55:01] the lutherans came out and then
[1:55:03] organized right back and today they are
[1:55:05] hand in glove with this ecumenical move
[1:55:08] the methodists came out and they
[1:55:10] organized right back the pentecostals
[1:55:12] came out and they organized right back
[1:55:15] there is going to be another coming out
[1:55:16] and praise god they won't organize back
[1:55:18] because they know the truth
[1:55:20] that group will be the bride of the last
[1:55:22] day
[1:55:24] now it said here that this had
[1:55:26] children
[1:55:27] now what were they
[1:55:29] they were daughters for they were
[1:55:31] churches just like her
[1:55:33] now here is a very interesting point
[1:55:35] jezebel and ahab had a daughter
[1:55:38] that daughter married jehoram the son of
[1:55:40] jehoshaphat and in second kings 8 16 it
[1:55:43] says that
[1:55:44] jehoram walked in the ways of his
[1:55:46] father-in-law
[1:55:48] he went right into idolatry by this
[1:55:49] marriage
[1:55:50] he brought god fearing and god
[1:55:52] worshiping judah into idolatry
[1:55:54] that is exactly what all these daughter
[1:55:56] churches have done even as i have
[1:55:58] pointed out to you they start in the
[1:56:00] truth and marry into organization and
[1:56:03] leave the word for tradition creeds etc
[1:56:06] now let me get this across
[1:56:09] in hebrews 13 7 it says
[1:56:12] obey them which have rule over you who
[1:56:14] have spoken to you the word of god
[1:56:17] it is the word that rules us not men
[1:56:19] now a man as a husband is head of the
[1:56:22] woman he rules her
[1:56:24] but the church is a woman too and her
[1:56:26] ruler is the word jesus is the word
[1:56:30] if she rejects the word and takes any
[1:56:32] other headship she is an adulteress
[1:56:35] now you name me one church that hasn't
[1:56:36] given up the word for traditions and
[1:56:38] creeds they are all adulterouses
[1:56:41] like mother like daughter
[1:56:44] what will be the punishment of the
[1:56:45] harlot and her children
[1:56:47] well it is going to be twofold
[1:56:50] first he said
[1:56:51] i will cast her into a bed
[1:56:54] according to the last part of verse 22
[1:56:56] it will be a bed of tribulation or the
[1:56:58] great tribulation
[1:56:59] that is exactly what jesus said in
[1:57:01] matthew 25 1-13
[1:57:05] there were ten virgins
[1:57:06] five were wise and five were foolish the
[1:57:09] five wise had oil the holy spirit
[1:57:12] but the other five did not
[1:57:14] when the cry went up
[1:57:16] behold the bridegroom cometh the five
[1:57:19] foolish had to run seeking oil while the
[1:57:21] five wise virgins went into the marriage
[1:57:24] the five that remained outside were left
[1:57:25] to the great tribulation
[1:57:28] that is what will happen to all who do
[1:57:30] not go up in the rapture
[1:57:32] that is what will come upon the harlot
[1:57:33] and her daughters
[1:57:35] secondly it says that he will kill them
[1:57:37] with death or as a literal translation
[1:57:39] says
[1:57:40] let them be put to death with death
[1:57:43] this is a strange saying
[1:57:45] we might say
[1:57:46] let a man be put to death by hanging or
[1:57:48] by electrocution or some other way
[1:57:51] but this says
[1:57:52] let them be put to death by death
[1:57:55] death itself is the cause of their death
[1:57:59] now i want you to see this clearly so i
[1:58:00] will take our illustration again of the
[1:58:02] daughter of jezebel marrying into the
[1:58:04] house of judah and thereby bringing it
[1:58:06] right into idolatry and causing god to
[1:58:09] deliver judah to death
[1:58:11] that is what balaam did too
[1:58:13] so here was jezebel with her paganism
[1:58:16] over there is judah properly worshiping
[1:58:18] god and living under the word
[1:58:20] so jezebel marries her daughter to
[1:58:22] jehoram the minute that happens jehoram
[1:58:25] causes the people to become idolaters
[1:58:27] the minute that marriage took place
[1:58:29] judah was dead
[1:58:30] spiritual death came in
[1:58:33] the minute the first church of rome
[1:58:34] organized it died
[1:58:36] the minute that the lutherans organized
[1:58:39] death came in and they died
[1:58:41] the pentecostals came along last and
[1:58:43] they organized the spirit left though
[1:58:45] they don't believe it but he did that
[1:58:48] marriage brought death
[1:58:50] then the light of oneness of the godhead
[1:58:52] came
[1:58:53] they organized and they died too
[1:58:56] then after the fire of god fell on the
[1:58:58] ohio river in 1933
[1:59:00] a healing revival swept the world but it
[1:59:03] never came through any organization
[1:59:05] god went outside the pentecostal groups
[1:59:07] outside of organization
[1:59:09] and what he is going to do in the future
[1:59:11] is going to be outside organization too
[1:59:14] god can't work through the dead
[1:59:16] he can only work through the living
[1:59:18] members
[1:59:19] those living members are outside of
[1:59:21] babylon
[1:59:23] so you see death or organization came
[1:59:26] and the church died or to make it
[1:59:28] plainer death became a resident wherein
[1:59:30] shortly before only life reigned
[1:59:33] as the original eve brought death to
[1:59:35] mankind so now organization has brought
[1:59:38] death for organization is the product of
[1:59:41] the double corrupters nicolaitanism
[1:59:44] propagated by the prophetess jezebel
[1:59:47] now eve should have been burned along
[1:59:49] with the serpent for their awful deed
[1:59:51] but adam intervened taking her quickly
[1:59:53] to himself so that she was saved
[1:59:56] but when this satanic religion has gone
[1:59:58] the full course of the ages there will
[2:00:00] be no one to intervene
[2:00:02] and she will be burned with her seducer
[2:00:05] for the and her children and the
[2:00:06] antichrist and satan will all find their
[2:00:08] places in the lake of fire
[2:00:12] right here i will be getting ahead of
[2:00:13] myself and maybe i ought to reserve this
[2:00:15] for the message on the last age
[2:00:18] but it seems just right to put it in now
[2:00:20] because it deals so clearly with
[2:00:21] organization and what is going to happen
[2:00:23] through it
[2:00:25] and i want to warn you
[2:00:26] revelation 13 1-18
[2:00:30] and i stood upon the sand of the sea
[2:00:32] and saw a beast rise up out of the sea
[2:00:35] having seven heads and ten horns and
[2:00:38] upon his horns ten crowns and upon his
[2:00:41] heads the name of blasphemy
[2:00:43] and the beast which i saw was like unto
[2:00:45] a leopard and his feet were as the feet
[2:00:47] of a bear
[2:00:48] and his mouth as the mouth of a lion
[2:00:51] and the dragon gave him his power and
[2:00:53] his seat and great authority
[2:00:55] and i saw one of his heads as it were
[2:00:57] wounded to death
[2:00:58] and his deadly wound was healed and all
[2:01:01] the world wandered after the beast
[2:01:04] and they worshiped the dragon which gave
[2:01:05] power unto the beast and they worship
[2:01:07] the beast saying who is like unto the
[2:01:10] beast who is able to make war with him
[2:01:13] and there was given unto him a mouth
[2:01:15] speaking great things and blasphemies
[2:01:17] and power was given unto him to continue
[2:01:19] forty and two months
[2:01:21] and he opened his mouth in blasphemy
[2:01:23] against god to blaspheme his name and
[2:01:25] his tabernacle and them that dwell in
[2:01:27] heaven
[2:01:28] and it was given unto him to make war
[2:01:30] with the saints and to overcome them
[2:01:33] and power was given him over all
[2:01:35] kindreds and tongues and nations
[2:01:38] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[2:01:40] worship him whose names are not written
[2:01:42] in the book of life of the lamb slain
[2:01:44] from the foundation of the world
[2:01:46] if any man have an ear let him hear
[2:01:49] he that bleedeth into captivity shall go
[2:01:51] into captivity he that killeth with the
[2:01:54] sword must be killed with the sword
[2:01:57] here is the patience and the faith of
[2:01:58] the saints
[2:02:00] and i beheld another beast coming up out
[2:02:02] of the earth and he had two horns like a
[2:02:04] lamb and he spake as a dragon
[2:02:06] and he exerciseth all the power of the
[2:02:08] first beast before him and causeth the
[2:02:11] earth and them which dwelt therein to
[2:02:13] worship the first beast whose deadly
[2:02:15] wound was healed
[2:02:17] and he doeth great wonders so that he
[2:02:19] maketh fire come down from heaven on the
[2:02:21] earth in the sight of men
[2:02:23] and he deceiveth them that dwell on the
[2:02:25] earth by the means of those miracles
[2:02:27] which he had power to do in the sight of
[2:02:29] the beast
[2:02:30] saying to them that dwell on the earth
[2:02:32] that they should make an image to the
[2:02:34] beast which had the wound by a sword and
[2:02:36] did live
[2:02:38] and he had power to give life under the
[2:02:40] image of the beast that the image of the
[2:02:42] beast should both speak and caused that
[2:02:44] as many as would not worship the image
[2:02:46] of the beast should be killed
[2:02:49] and he causeth all
[2:02:50] both small and great rich and poor free
[2:02:53] and bond to receive a mark in their
[2:02:55] right hand or in their foreheads
[2:02:58] and that no man might buy or sell save
[2:03:01] he that had the mark or the name of the
[2:03:03] beast or the number of his name
[2:03:06] here is wisdom
[2:03:07] let him that hath understanding count
[2:03:09] the number of the beast
[2:03:11] for it is the number of a man and his
[2:03:14] number is six hundred threescore and six
[2:03:18] this chapter shows the power of the
[2:03:20] roman catholic church and what she will
[2:03:22] do through organization
[2:03:24] remember this is the false vine
[2:03:26] let it name the name of the lord it does
[2:03:28] so only in a lie
[2:03:30] its headship is not of the lord but of
[2:03:32] satan it finally ends up completely
[2:03:35] identified with the beast
[2:03:37] the riding on the scarlet beast
[2:03:39] distinctly shows her power is the god of
[2:03:41] force satan and not our god the lord
[2:03:44] jesus christ
[2:03:46] in verse 17 it emphatically shows that
[2:03:49] she will gain absolute control of the
[2:03:51] commerce of the earth for no man can buy
[2:03:53] or sell apart from her this is born out
[2:03:56] in revelation 18 9-17
[2:04:00] which shows her involvement with kings
[2:04:02] princes merchants all of whom have to do
[2:04:04] with rome and commerce
[2:04:07] in revelation 13 14 we learned that the
[2:04:10] beast spreads his influence through the
[2:04:12] image which was built for him
[2:04:14] the image that is made is a worldwide
[2:04:16] ecumenical council
[2:04:18] wherein all the organized churches will
[2:04:19] get together with the roman catholics
[2:04:22] they are doing it even now it is quite
[2:04:24] possible this union will come in order
[2:04:26] to stop the power of communism
[2:04:28] but since communism like nebuchadnezzar
[2:04:30] has been raised up to burn the flesh of
[2:04:32] the harlot rome will be overcome and
[2:04:34] destroyed
[2:04:36] take note that everywhere the romish
[2:04:38] church went communism followed it has to
[2:04:41] be that way
[2:04:42] and let me warn you now don't get
[2:04:44] thinking communism is your only enemy no
[2:04:46] sir it is the catholic church also and
[2:04:49] even more so
[2:04:51] now let us read revelation 13 1-4
[2:04:55] and compare this with revelation 12 1-5
[2:04:58] revelation 13 1-4
[2:05:02] and i stood upon the sand of the sea
[2:05:04] and saw a beast rise up out of the sea
[2:05:07] having seven heads and ten horns and
[2:05:09] upon his horns ten crowns
[2:05:12] and upon his heads the name of blasphemy
[2:05:15] and the beast which i saw was like unto
[2:05:17] a leopard and his feet were as the feet
[2:05:19] of a bear and his
[2:05:21] mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him
[2:05:24] his power and his seat and great
[2:05:25] authority
[2:05:26] and i saw one of his heads as it were
[2:05:28] wounded to death
[2:05:30] and his deadly wound was healed
[2:05:32] and all the world wandered after the
[2:05:34] beast
[2:05:35] and they worshipped the dragon which
[2:05:36] gave power unto the beast and they
[2:05:39] worshiped the beast saying who is like
[2:05:41] unto the beast who is able to make war
[2:05:43] with him
[2:05:45] revelation 12
[2:05:46] 1-5 and there appeared a great wonder in
[2:05:49] heaven a woman clothed with the sun and
[2:05:52] the moon under her feet and upon her
[2:05:54] head a crown of twelve stars
[2:05:56] and she being with child cried
[2:05:58] travailing in birth and pain to be
[2:06:00] delivered
[2:06:01] and there appeared another wonder in
[2:06:03] heaven
[2:06:04] and behold a great red dragon having
[2:06:06] seven heads and ten horns and seven
[2:06:08] crowns upon his heads
[2:06:10] and his tail drew the third part of the
[2:06:12] stars of heaven and it cast them to the
[2:06:14] earth
[2:06:15] and the dragon stood before the woman
[2:06:17] which was ready to be delivered for to
[2:06:19] devour her child as soon as it was born
[2:06:22] and she brought forth a man-child who
[2:06:24] was to rule all nations with a rod of
[2:06:26] iron
[2:06:27] and her child was caught up unto god and
[2:06:29] to his throne
[2:06:31] satan and his satanic religion are in
[2:06:33] both of these beasts
[2:06:35] in revelation 14 the beast that was
[2:06:38] wounded unto death but lived again is
[2:06:40] imperial pagan rome that fell to the
[2:06:42] onslaught of the barbarians and thereby
[2:06:43] lost her temporal power
[2:06:46] but she regained it in papal rome
[2:06:48] do you see it
[2:06:49] the nation that ruled by crushing all in
[2:06:51] which became the strongest empire ever
[2:06:54] known was finally wounded to death
[2:06:56] her power was gone physically as to
[2:06:58] control by armies etc
[2:07:01] but under constantine she came back to
[2:07:03] life
[2:07:03] for papal rome has infiltrated the whole
[2:07:06] world and her power is absolute
[2:07:08] she uses kings and merchants and in her
[2:07:11] deadly religious and financial strength
[2:07:13] she is governing as the goddess of this
[2:07:14] present age
[2:07:16] she is also the dragon that stood
[2:07:17] waiting to devour the man-child
[2:07:20] herod tried to kill the lord jesus and
[2:07:22] failed
[2:07:23] later jesus was crucified by roman
[2:07:25] soldiers but now is caught up to the
[2:07:27] throne
[2:07:32] where he says that
[2:07:34] of course
[2:07:35] in revelation where he's fixed of the
[2:07:37] dragon who will be fought to devour the
[2:07:40] man child
[2:07:41] and
[2:07:42] then
[2:07:43] the mother ran into the desert and all
[2:07:45] that
[2:07:46] so that can be looked at both
[2:07:49] spiritually and also physically
[2:07:59] tried to kill the lord jesus and faith
[2:08:02] later yes was specified by the roman
[2:08:04] soldiers but now
[2:08:05] he's caught up to the throne so we see
[2:08:08] that it already happened physically
[2:08:10] but also it is going to happen
[2:08:13] spiritually okay
[2:08:15] the therefore that same beast that same
[2:08:18] uh
[2:08:19] god the dragon
[2:08:21] of the world of the world the dragon
[2:08:23] wants to do far to be rather manchester
[2:08:26] remember you remember when when paul was
[2:08:28] going and uh
[2:08:30] and uh the the the voice of the lord
[2:08:32] believed
[2:08:33] uh
[2:08:34] that paul why do you persecute me he
[2:08:36] said that how am i prosecuted
[2:08:40] he don't even know how he persecuted him
[2:08:42] but he was appealing him by prosecuting
[2:08:44] the church
[2:08:45] so the judge of jesus christ is that
[2:08:49] man child
[2:08:52] you know and and the devil would want to
[2:08:54] to still attack and devour that same
[2:08:58] christ in us
[2:09:00] you see at this how
[2:09:02] but like like like jesus was able to
[2:09:05] overcome
[2:09:07] like he was able to die and rise again
[2:09:10] in the same way today
[2:09:12] in our generation in this generation
[2:09:14] that we are going to contend with this
[2:09:16] same power electrical actually already
[2:09:18] containing recent problems in many many
[2:09:20] ways in many many ways but we know that
[2:09:23] its power is going to come into full
[2:09:25] force
[2:09:26] during the tribulation
[2:09:29] who will be here to see that
[2:09:31] raise up your hand
[2:09:33] well i hope no one will be here to see
[2:09:35] that because in the tribulation we will
[2:09:38] not be here
[2:09:39] i will not be here to say that
[2:09:41] hallelujah because i know that the
[2:09:44] chariot is coming and i i and and i'll
[2:09:47] go i'll go away i i will not be here
[2:09:49] i'll fly away all right that's what i'm
[2:09:51] waiting for i'm waiting for the
[2:09:53] challenge and i'm waiting for the
[2:09:56] chariot to swing glory
[2:10:01] [Music]
[2:10:07] [Applause]
[2:10:12] well
[2:10:13] i want to be in that number when the
[2:10:15] saints go marching in i'm waiting for
[2:10:17] that cherry the stream low and i'll step
[2:10:19] in but we know that this this system
[2:10:23] this dragon is the same as um
[2:10:26] the dragon that was
[2:10:29] is
[2:10:30] same she is also the drummer that's true
[2:10:32] waiting to divide in manchester but we
[2:10:34] know that the devil comes in many ways
[2:10:36] of course he used wrong but he also uses
[2:10:38] many other things but we noticed that
[2:10:40] when he talked about uh wrong uh up
[2:10:44] there he says that uh
[2:10:46] there was there was an image made like
[2:10:49] after the beast and he said what's that
[2:10:51] image someone who was following me on to
[2:10:53] see who would follow the reading what
[2:10:55] was that image
[2:10:57] come on now
[2:10:59] what was the image which was made like
[2:11:01] under the the beast
[2:11:07] so sorry again
[2:11:12] the ecumenical council
[2:11:14] some people miss that i want to see if i
[2:11:15] can get it up here
[2:11:17] now i thought that you're following and
[2:11:19] i don't need to explain every line every
[2:11:21] bus
[2:11:23] okay uh where is it are we right here
[2:11:26] is it up or if i let it down
[2:11:30] okay down here it talks about the
[2:11:33] ecumenical cancer um
[2:11:36] how it was um
[2:11:37] that power
[2:11:40] that raises up as the image like unto
[2:11:43] the beast
[2:11:44] and uh
[2:11:46] we talk about people who are going to
[2:11:48] persecute the the freak body you think
[2:11:51] it's going to be the catholic church
[2:11:54] it's going to be this very
[2:11:56] image which is like after the district
[2:11:57] castle they're all they are coming
[2:11:59] together those denominations they're all
[2:12:01] coming together thinking they're coming
[2:12:03] together for a good cause
[2:12:05] but we have found out they are the
[2:12:08] daughter of this house
[2:12:10] because this hallow had a watch
[2:12:14] our children had daughters
[2:12:16] and these daughters were like andra oh i
[2:12:18] used
[2:12:51] and i stood up upon the sand and and the
[2:12:54] sea and so the
[2:12:56] beast raised up out of the sea having
[2:12:58] seven heads and ten horns and upon his
[2:13:01] horns still grounds and upon his heads
[2:13:03] they never blasted
[2:13:05] and the piece which i saw was like onto
[2:13:07] a notepad and his feet were like the
[2:13:10] feet of a bear and his mouth as the
[2:13:13] mouth of a lion and the drama gave him
[2:13:15] power
[2:13:17] gave him his power and his seats are in
[2:13:20] great authority and i saw one of his
[2:13:22] great pains as doing one day today and
[2:13:25] if that the wound was huge
[2:13:41] yes
[2:13:44] it's quite possible
[2:13:46] this union will come in order to stop
[2:13:48] the power of colleges
[2:13:51] but since communism like nebuchadnezzar
[2:13:53] has been raised up to ban the pleasure
[2:13:55] of the others
[2:13:57] wrong will be overcome and destroyed
[2:13:59] take note that
[2:14:01] that everywhere the rummage will charge
[2:14:03] went
[2:14:04] uh you don't know what i'm looking
[2:14:10] for down
[2:14:27] all right
[2:14:28] okay yes
[2:14:29] okay the image is made
[2:14:32] is our is made
[2:14:34] that is made is a wild way ecumenical
[2:14:44] you know today to be in an organization
[2:14:47] or part of it
[2:14:49] is almost to be dead
[2:14:52] and i'm
[2:14:53] when they organize they die when you
[2:14:56] listen to the church i don't know how
[2:14:58] many are listening to the message
[2:15:00] how many listen to the message of your
[2:15:01] hand
[2:15:03] okay you don't usually listen to the
[2:15:05] message
[2:15:07] to listen to it is
[2:15:09] it's good
[2:15:10] let me tell you whenever i listen to my
[2:15:11] message i feel refreshed
[2:15:13] and by the bottom says you like saying
[2:15:15] that when they organize
[2:15:17] they die
[2:15:19] whenever they organize they died
[2:15:22] so that's why
[2:15:24] we are not an organization
[2:15:26] that's why we are not a denomination
[2:15:27] hallelujah
[2:15:29] where of course to be organized does not
[2:15:31] mean that we should be disorganized
[2:15:33] because we are not organized he is
[2:15:35] saying when they nominate okay where you
[2:15:38] know they organize the chapters you see
[2:15:40] that again there will go again together
[2:15:42] with the roman catholics they have
[2:15:44] already
[2:15:45] the last group to join them has done it
[2:15:47] about three years ago they pentecostals
[2:15:49] don't change the same roman catholic
[2:15:51] system of course they are not gendered
[2:15:53] roman catholic church but they have come
[2:15:55] in connection and in agreement with them
[2:15:58] by so doing they have joined this image
[2:16:01] that is
[2:16:13] it is quite possible this union will
[2:16:15] come in order to stop the power of the
[2:16:17] comments well that unit has already come
[2:16:19] and i'm telling you that's the greatest
[2:16:21] threat
[2:16:22] that is there
[2:16:24] to the believer and we found out the
[2:16:26] only way they can survive it to do what
[2:16:30] who
[2:16:36] that is the only way they can survive
[2:16:38] the wrath of god is to come out of
[2:16:40] hawaii people be not partakers of our
[2:16:42] sin some of you who are born in
[2:16:44] what you're the messiah
[2:16:47] you know what it means brother you

[2:16:50] to miss it

[2:16:55] you'll see i understand yes you
[2:16:57] understand brother
[2:16:58] some of these people maybe you you you
[2:17:01] you don't know what you are mean
[2:17:03] you know
[2:17:04] when you you you're building those
[2:17:06] denominations and then you come out and
[2:17:08] you see this like this message
