[21:15] [Music]
[21:20] Jesus
[21:23] this morning we are thinking about the
[21:26] grace that has saved us and the grace
[21:27] that has made us who we are enjoy
[21:30] [Music]
[21:36] to hide your people and I'm talking
[21:38] about it you had your people that are
[21:41] people that we are called by your name
[21:43] [Music]
[21:45] but by Grace we have been grafted are
[21:49] you rich
[21:54] [Music]
[22:01] Israel was the original yesterday

[22:30] and now we can stand and say boldly
[22:35] we are children foreign
[23:01] [Music]
[23:18] [Music]
[23:32] and bind us with the courts of the Holy
[23:34] Ghost this morning
[23:37] thank you for the song service
[23:40] thank you Lord foreign
[23:48] [Music]
[24:06] foreign
[24:09] [Music]
[24:47] for this I could not exactly remember
[24:49] the book that it's in and I'm sure that
[24:52] um one of the books I read on Mr Moody
[24:54] do I eat moody in Chicago
[25:05] and he says that Modi that Mr Modi after
[25:08] reading Romans 7 again
[25:12] he ran into the streets
[25:15] he ran into the streets
[25:18] and the first man he met
[25:20] he said to him
[25:24] do you know Grace
[25:28] and the man replied
[25:31] Grace who integration me
[25:35] and so Mr Modi said the grace of God
[25:43] so it's really him when he's seen that
[25:46] how Grace had separated us from the Lord
[25:55] praise the name of the Lord
[25:57] Amazing Grace
[26:00] how sweet that sounds
[26:03] and we will take a reading from The Book
[26:05] of Genesis chapter 22 verse 15.
[26:12] and the angel of the Lord called unto
[26:14] Abraham Out of Heaven the second time
[26:16] and said by myself have I sworn saith
[26:20] the Lord for because thou has done this
[26:22] thing and has not withheld thy son thy
[26:25] only son that in blessing I'll blessed
[26:27] thee and in multiplying I will multiply
[26:30] thy seed as the stars of the heaven and
[26:33] as the sand which is upon the sea shore
[26:35] and the seed shall possess the Gate of
[26:37] his enemies and indeed shall all the
[26:40] nations of the earth be blessed because
[26:42] thou Hast obeyed my voice
[26:52] foreign
[27:06] [Music]
[27:24] praise the Lord you may be seated
[27:30] amen
[27:34] so
[27:36] um in Genesis
[27:40] and and you know these words that um
[27:42] Dwight Moody we've read about what Modi
[27:46] said to somebody
[27:50] he had read in the Bible
[27:58] and after reading that then he came to
[28:01] somebody on the street randomly
[28:05] and they asked them
[28:09] they don't interpret number
[28:11] so he said do you know Grace
[28:16] do you know Grace Gracie
[28:19] foreign
[28:42] and so this man asked
[28:45] somebody do you know Grace
[28:49] do you mean grace
[28:52] [Music]
[28:59] and so um we've been able to find that
[29:02] this man was not meaning Grace as in
[29:04] Grace somebody
[29:09] he was speaking of the grace of God
[29:14] and so I ask you do you know Grace
[29:17] of money can you ask somebody do you
[29:20] know Grace
[29:23] do you know Grace Grace have you ever
[29:26] met Grace
[29:28] do you know Grace Grace of money praise
[29:31] the name of the Lord
[29:32] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[29:35] hallelujah so the blood on the sound you
[29:37] really have to give me good sound so
[29:39] that we can uh bring forth the word and
[29:43] if you need somebody to help you then
[29:45] call them up
[29:46] so I would like to uh dwell much on the
[29:51] promise that God gave uh Ibrahim
[30:01] Abraham being being a man that God chose
[30:08] in a country that was not perfect
[30:12] at the time that the whole world was in
[30:16] sin against
[30:18] the wrath of God
[30:20] had come up to destroy the world
[30:23] can you remember it was at this same
[30:26] time that God came down and um with you
[30:29] know with two angels
[30:33] and they visited
[30:36] Abraham in the plains of mamrix
[30:42] some place
[30:45] and his wife was inside
[30:51] and so one of the Angels Came and spoke
[30:55] to him and of course we know that this
[30:58] was America
[31:00] and so it was God himself
[31:02] can you imagine God walking into your
[31:05] attention
[31:07] can you imagine that and so God walked
[31:10] to Abraham's 10.
[31:14] recognized who God was
[31:20] spoke I mean God spoke to Abraham
[31:23] and told him that he would have uh the
[31:26] promise that God that he had given him
[31:30] and so Abraham did not doubt Ibrahimovic
[31:36] this Angel spoke to Abraham
[31:40] and Sarah did not agree
[31:43] and you know Sarah said Sarah laughed in
[31:47] her heart
[31:48] with me at my age
[31:59] [Music]
[32:03] I want you to see that Abraham was as a
[32:06] sinner just like the rest of them
[32:12] initially
[32:15] and he and his father and his cousins
[32:18] and everybody else was a sinner yes
[32:28] I promise just like the rest of them
[32:32] but God by his election
[32:36] by his love and grace
[32:39] he came to Abram and it and you know
[32:43] Abraham was unlike his brothers
[32:48] he was born
[32:51] but still God came to him
[33:00] [Music]
[33:05] so there is nothing that is going to
[33:07] keep God in your life
[33:12] and that's why I wanted you to ask
[33:14] yourself that question this morning do
[33:16] you know Grace
[33:23] he told him leave your people
[33:28] believe everything that you have here
[33:31] I want you to go to our land
[33:34] which I will show you and there I will
[33:37] make you a great nation
[33:43] so God gave Abraham promises
[33:47] a God he had never seen
[33:50] your body
[34:22] [Music]
[34:52] that is why is God our father in the
[34:55] face
[34:56] because for him yeah he believed god
[35:06] without even sensing anything
[35:09] he believed God it was counted to him
[35:15] praise the name of the Lord and the age
[35:19] of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of
[35:20] Heaven the second time
[35:26] foreign
[35:28] by myself
[35:31] have I sworn saith the Lord
[35:34] for because thou has done this thing
[35:39] and that's not withheld thy son
[35:44] only son
[35:46] of course this is many uh years
[35:49] afterwards
[35:51] because when God called Abraham
[35:54] Abraham fought the voice because we know
[35:58] the journey how Abraham brought lot with
[36:01] him
[36:03] and you know until that Lord dies in
[36:06] your life sometimes you may not receive
[36:08] the blessings that God has planned for
[36:09] you
[36:16] sometimes people come to the Lord
[36:19] and they answer the call
[36:21] but they come with Lords
[36:24] Lord is certain things that you are not
[36:27] give up
[36:31] what are some of those things that you
[36:33] love and cherish so much that you are
[36:35] you can do anything to retain them
[36:41] and I'm telling you you cannot walk into
[36:44] your full promise until you let the Lord
[36:46] God
[36:52] Amen maybe your neighbor is losing slap
[36:54] them and tell them let Lord go now
[36:59] come on come on tell your neighbor
[37:03] Amen Let let's go again praise the name
[37:07] of the Lord amen hallelujah amen and
[37:10] Lord luti was an encumbrance
[37:16] for God to be able to meet
[37:51] but you see when it reached some place
[37:55] Abraham came back to his mind
[37:59] and he realized he needed to let Lord go
[38:02] not again
[38:03] and Lord was his cousin
[38:06] the Lord was related to Abrams
[38:10] and the father of Lord had died
[38:15] was just being a good man
[38:19] to bring a long Lord
[38:22] so that Lord can may be for adventure be
[38:26] a part of his Blessing
[38:30] but I'm speaking to you this morning
[38:33] what I'm saying to you Lord cannot be a
[38:37] part of your blessings
[38:44] never walk in the fullness of the
[38:47] blessing of God for your life
[38:50] and this one morning
[38:53] foreign
[38:59] [Music]
[39:45] [Applause]
[39:52] so that day when Lord decided to make a
[39:56] decision
[39:58] Lord did not decide to go to the desert
[40:01] with Abram
[40:02] again
[40:04] Abraham was destined destined for the
[40:07] desert
[40:10] but Lord did not love the desert
[40:14] Lord did not love hardships
[40:17] Lord did not love to go through the you
[40:20] know the the straight not away
[40:39] that was only happy when he went to
[40:42] sodomy
[40:44] but at least if he did not go to Sodom
[40:46] he would go to government
[40:50] but you see with Abraham
[41:51] was already developed
[41:59] big big
[42:02] they had all the pumps
[42:05] they had all the
[42:12] they had all the clubs they had all
[42:16] everything you would want to have
[42:19] they had all the betting houses
[42:29] you know that would dress bikinis and go
[42:31] out on the streets
[42:34] they had everything that you would think
[42:37] of in the world
[42:40] they had even the powerful universities
[42:44] they had you know great big buildings
[42:48] beautiful streets even big churches
[42:52] where they will come and sing and dance
[43:01] developed and civilized
[43:05] and Lord his heart was connected to that
[43:10] you know there are some people who are
[43:12] connected to some you know powerful
[43:14] things
[43:17] whereby when you see something beginning
[43:20] and young and you know not looking so
[43:22] nice oh you are not attracted
[43:28] some people are connected to what we
[43:31] call
[43:32] classes
[43:41] you know this is how Cain was
[43:45] in a beautiful things
[43:49] you know you know fruits things that
[43:53] don't have blood
[43:55] things which are not you know like you
[43:58] know shopping
[44:00] you know things gets gets you into get
[44:03] you involved I got to win you get him
[44:06] you know but you see up there on the
[44:08] country like Abraham
[44:10] Ibrahim he was he was ready in his heart
[44:14] to go for hardships
[44:17] listen to me we have to see seeds in the
[44:20] world
[44:21] the seed of God and the seed of the
[44:24] devil anyway
[44:31] the seed of God is ready to suffer from
[44:33] the sake of Christ
[44:37] they say the seed of God is rather to be
[44:39] trained by God
[44:43] they can get the blessing of God
[44:46] and the blessing of God women will
[44:50] always make them Rich
[44:53] whereby no matter what you try to give
[44:55] them they can never be satisfied
[44:58] what satisfies them is the pure
[45:22] [Music]
[45:36] because I were decided to choose that
[45:39] narrow and straight away
[45:43] I can say I know Grace
[45:48] is the ability
[45:51] Amen to to for you to understand
[45:54] that God has loved you so much
[45:57] and has called you for a greater purpose
[46:01] foreign
[46:41] [Music]
[46:51] [Music]
[47:00] straight is the gate and narrows away
[47:03] can you go listen to righteousness
[47:14] whatever you do no problem
[47:17] do what you do no problems
[47:22] [Music]
[47:28] is straight and narrow
[47:31] can you go this one is hard
[47:34] but whoever goes through that way
[47:48] hallelujah amen and here is now what I
[47:51] wanted to say
[47:53] you don't even have to worry
[47:56] the moment you choose to walk into the
[47:59] narrow way
[48:01] you are not on your own
[48:04] [Music]
[48:06] that is what usually consoles me
[48:09] you are not on your own because when God
[48:13] called Abraham
[48:14] he told him this by myself
[48:19] I have sworn
[48:23] hallelujah amen God put his word
[48:28] amen on the line here
[48:30] God put his reputation
[48:43] Hallelujah God did not swear by the
[48:47] Vatican cartoon
[48:56] he did not swear by the pope or the
[48:59] Catholic church
[49:01] God swore by himself
[49:05] his reputation is at stage
[49:11] meaning if he does not fulfill his
[49:13] promise
[49:23] because you have done this thing
[49:28] amen because Abraham decided to take the
[49:31] narrow away Ibrahim is
[49:32] not always
[49:38] full of suffering and tears
[49:45] it is full of sad things
[49:49] let me tell you something
[49:54] you have a promise
[49:56] God has sworn by himself
[49:59] that is
[51:04] what do you see
[51:41] [Music]
[52:00] hallelujah amen it might be difficult
[52:03] even in your marriage
[52:13] you have a promise foreign
[52:34] [Music]
[53:09] [Music]
[53:35] [Music]
[53:45] I'd like you to stay here
[53:48] foreign
[54:57] [Music]
[55:11] foreign
[55:39] it must have been tough
[55:41] it must have been difficult
[55:46] he bow on the hands of the boys
[55:54] I'm sorry
[55:57] the boy was well taught
[56:00] that moment I am the sacrifice
[56:05] he said to God if you're going to
[56:07] sacrifice me
[56:08] I Give Myself Away
[56:13] hallelujah amen
[56:15] sometimes you may think God has wiped
[56:19] all your dreams away
[56:23] no he has not can never beat you no he
[56:26] cannot that's all the picture God is Not
[56:29] ruthless
[56:39] hallelujah amen he can never wipe your
[56:42] future
[56:58] [Music]
[57:15] because he didn't want the boys

[1:15:44] pay attention
[1:15:46] here is the news
[1:15:48] all those promises
[1:15:51] where to the Natural seeds all those we
[1:15:56] have seen we are only the natural seeds
[1:15:59] and was only a shadow
[1:16:02] the reality was yet to come
[1:16:09] there is always
[1:16:18] amen
[1:16:19] he does not share blood with abrahamas
[1:16:22] but it says
[1:16:27] amen hallelujah
[1:16:32] and the prophet of God here says
[1:16:33] something says when we know this
[1:16:36] the only thing we have to do is
[1:16:41] promises
[1:16:43] is to stay put on God's word
[1:16:53] he perfectly taped Abraham and his seed
[1:16:57] after him
[1:17:01] and I'm going to follow the Junctions of
[1:17:04] Abraham's life and then follow the
[1:17:05] Junctions of Abraham
[1:17:11] and you will see if God kept his word
[1:17:13] letter by letter
[1:17:17] and it says you can follow me as I'm
[1:17:20] reading here he says we know he says we
[1:17:24] know that there is only one way that we
[1:17:26] can be saved
[1:17:29] and that is
[1:17:32] Hallelujah
[1:17:55] I want you to see this here is something
[1:17:58] that happened
[1:18:13] was Jesus Christ

[1:18:25] Abraham yesterday
[1:18:27] out of Abraham come is
[1:18:33] Israel as we know
[1:18:38] Joseph and so forth
[1:18:40] [Music]
[1:18:45] finally the Royal seed was born which is
[1:18:49] was Christ
[1:18:55] I mean made Abraham the father of all
[1:18:58] Nations
[1:18:58] [Music]
[1:19:07] and listen this is my favorite part that
[1:19:11] is given to the people unconditionally
[1:19:16] he said
[1:19:18] Abraham Ibrahim absent to you by myself
[1:19:23] by myself
[1:19:27] what did Abraham do nothing what was the
[1:19:32] sacred Grace
[1:19:36] then unto Isaac what did Abraham do how
[1:19:40] did Isaac do nothing what was the
[1:19:43] secretary Grace
[1:19:46] because he was a Seed of Abraham
[1:19:49] by foreign
[1:20:11] now Jesus yes was the royal Seed of
[1:20:14] Abraham
[1:20:16] who would possess the Gate of the
[1:20:19] enemies
[1:20:22] Hallelujah
[1:20:24] brother Fred did he possess the guests
[1:20:34] do we say nothing oh yes we do
[1:20:37] he came from Heaven to us
[1:20:41] to show the way
[1:20:45] from the Earth to the cross
[1:20:49] [Music]
[1:20:51] from the cross to the ground
[1:20:55] from the grave to the sky
[1:20:58] Lord I Lift Your Name
[1:21:03] when he came from Heaven he came because
[1:21:07] when he came to Africa he was beaten he
[1:21:11] was smitten he was laughed
[1:21:17] and the Bible says he was full of grace
[1:21:19] and truth
[1:21:21] and Jesus
[1:21:30] he said if you be the son of God
[1:21:34] do this connection
[1:21:38] make this transferred foreign
[1:22:22] you'll be the Son of God
[1:22:28] I'm checking one two one
[1:22:32] in every answer of Jesus
[1:22:40] hallelujah amen and the devil was
[1:22:43] confused on Earth
[1:22:45] because Jesus
[1:22:47] was beaten and he did not beat them back
[1:22:52] he possessed
[1:22:56] Jesus yes was sent to God before Pontius
[1:23:01] spoiler pirate
[1:23:03] spirit and before the others
[1:23:08] they put a crown of phones
[1:23:11] think about it a crown of thorns
[1:23:17] on his bro and he did nothing he
[1:23:21] possessed
[1:23:24] and then when he went to the cross
[1:23:27] the devil thought you would have him one
[1:23:30] last time
[1:23:32] the devil came in this man
[1:23:35] and the man told Jesus
[1:23:38] if you be the Son of God
[1:23:40] do you think this was the man speaking
[1:23:43] this was the same devil speaking
[1:23:47] serve us and save yourself
[1:23:50] protesters but he did not realize that
[1:23:53] again that Jesus was on the cross yes to
[1:23:56] possess the Gate of death
[1:23:59] he possessed
[1:24:03] it he saved the one who was supposed to
[1:24:06] be saved
[1:24:09] you will be with me in paradise
[1:24:12] and when Jesus gave up the ghost yes
[1:24:16] and he died he went straight to hell
[1:24:20] yeah
[1:24:22] and when he went to hell we had to come
[1:24:24] again the very first stop where a circle
[1:24:31] was hell itself
[1:24:35] he did not go as a gentleman this time
[1:24:41] listen church but if you want the seed
[1:24:44] or is it of Abraham what is that in
[1:24:47] Abraham he was the city
[1:24:49] and was supposed to possess the Gate of
[1:24:52] Hell and he already know Korea
[1:24:57] this was going to hell to be captured
[1:25:01] he went to hell to possession
[1:25:07] and Jesus yes went to hell
[1:25:10] that's a good summer oh yeah
[1:25:13] Jesus went to heaven yes
[1:25:16] I said Jesus
[1:25:20] Amen Let The Devil hear it because
[1:25:24] whenever he hears it he remembers the
[1:25:26] experience
[1:25:28] and the Jesus went to yesterday
[1:25:33] foreign
[1:25:48] he was used to those who were crying and
[1:25:50] screaming
[1:25:53] but this time it was someone who was
[1:25:56] knocking
[1:26:00] not knocking as though he was begging to
[1:26:02] be up and fall
[1:26:05] but he was knocking as though to
[1:26:07] surprise them
[1:26:09] and then they realized it was somebody
[1:26:13] strange
[1:26:35] freely foreign
[1:26:42] [Music]
[1:27:49] I'm sure that all these demons
[1:28:00] the devil had met Jesus a few days ago
[1:28:06] matter of fact how was ago hey that is
[1:28:15] standing at them again and he called all
[1:28:18] the demons
[1:28:20] I don't know how he called them
[1:28:23] maybe they have their own vocabulary
[1:28:26] all you in here
[1:28:31] [Music]
[1:28:35] I have been there on the cross
[1:28:38] and I saw him
[1:28:41] I even lost at him and I told him if you
[1:28:46] be the Son of God
[1:28:47] save yourself on us
[1:28:50] [Laughter]
[1:28:54] do not save himself
[1:28:59] but I was scanning enough
[1:29:06] today I even made a man to be as his
[1:29:09] side
[1:29:11] he did not know the devil was oh my
[1:29:15] goodness Hallelujah I never did not know
[1:29:17] he was helping God to fulfill prophecy
[1:29:22] by piercing the sight of Jesus
[1:29:26] what came out
[1:29:30] [Applause]
[1:29:57] because of the sight of Jesus
[1:30:05] foreign
[1:30:15] [Music]
[1:30:50] random
[1:30:58] [Applause]
[1:31:00] they must have jumped
[1:31:02] you know all the kind of dancers
[1:31:17] [Applause]
[1:31:30] in front of his followers
[1:31:33] and he realized not again this is the
[1:31:37] same man on the cross
[1:32:00] and if the devil said
[1:32:19] yesterday
[1:32:23] because
[1:32:43] [Music]
[1:33:04] and Jesus yes to kick the devil massage
[1:33:25] and Jesus yes took the case
[1:33:31] Swagger
[1:33:40] amen that is our Jesus yes
[1:33:43] that is our Jesus
[1:33:46] and before you left here
[1:33:49] he brought into some little corner
[1:33:53] Paradise
[1:33:54] where there was some believers
[1:33:58] who had been kept there all right
[1:34:04] [Music]
[1:34:05] said I'm here
[1:34:08] he didn't even need to introduce himself
[1:34:12] when he comes down one day
[1:34:15] when it comes down one day we shall
[1:34:19] recognize
[1:34:20] because we will be like
[1:34:24] hallelujah amen because we have known
[1:34:28] Grace
[1:34:29] I tell you the moment you believed in
[1:34:31] Jesus Christ
[1:34:33] you have
[1:34:36] met Grace
[1:34:43] foreign
[1:35:06] [Applause]
[1:35:27] really for Israel they are Israeli look
[1:35:30] at Malachi chapter four
[1:35:32] verse 5-6
[1:35:38] who have to believe in this message for
[1:35:40] years
[1:35:46] after what we have seen
[1:35:50] after our private studies in the Bible
[1:35:53] we have realized that Elijah the prophet
[1:35:57] is only to Israel why is not the
[1:36:01] Gentiles
[1:36:02] no Rachel we the Gentiles
[1:36:07] they don't know Grace and I'll prove
[1:36:10] that to you in a moment before I
[1:36:12] conclude here
[1:36:18] when Elijah came the first time
[1:36:20] he was too
[1:36:23] yeah
[1:36:26] is that right when they come he came the
[1:36:29] second time
[1:36:30] in Elijah he was two yes
[1:36:35] when he came the third time
[1:36:43] now he is coming again
[1:36:47] hallelujah amen in Revelation 11 3.
[1:36:52] Elijah is coming again and he's coming
[1:36:55] to
[1:36:56] foreign
[1:38:15] before the last portion of the 70 weeks
[1:38:19] ends
[1:38:23] there is a you know after the death of
[1:38:26] Jesus
[1:38:28] from that time from there is a space
[1:38:33] that is not known at all
[1:38:36] to the Jews
[1:38:40] in Romans chapter 11. the Bible says the
[1:38:44] Jews are actually blinded
[1:38:48] and I've lived in Ethiopia
[1:38:50] and I've met Jews
[1:38:55] they don't know Jesus
[1:39:57] foreign foreign
[1:41:13] and everything that was of the Jews that
[1:41:16] was remaining for the Jews fast should
[1:41:19] first go to the Gentile Church
[1:41:29] Elijah to the judge to the Jews
[1:41:32] first so he must first come to the
[1:41:35] judgmental child
[1:41:40] again
[1:41:54] [Music]
[1:42:40] and God told him not to go to Israel
[1:42:44] because if he had gone to Israel he had
[1:42:48] everything that that Elijah will have
[1:42:50] for Israel
[1:42:54] and it was not yet the time for the Jews
[1:42:57] and so God told him no that's not your
[1:43:01] part
[1:43:02] he will stand around he only stopped in
[1:43:04] Egypt and he met King Arafat
[1:43:07] and he never went to Israel and God
[1:43:11] stopped him because it wasn't the time
[1:43:13] for the Israel again
[1:43:16] God had to complete with the Jew the
[1:43:18] Gentiles
[1:43:21] wouldn't then become an Elijah to the
[1:43:24] Gentiles
[1:43:30] by Grace we did not deserve it was not
[1:43:35] our portion was not meant to be the
[1:43:38] child
[1:43:40] foreign
[1:44:49] [Music]
[1:45:12] I agree
[1:45:16] yes
[1:45:57] we know our system too many employers
[1:46:00] cannot take us to Heaven
[1:46:02] our Doctrine cannot take us to Heaven
[1:46:05] only one thing that is the grace of God
[1:46:11] hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of
[1:46:13] the Lord what has happened to us we have
[1:46:17] been grafted in
[1:46:19] and now we can say we know Grace

[1:46:27] and if you have realized it just tell
[1:46:29] them
