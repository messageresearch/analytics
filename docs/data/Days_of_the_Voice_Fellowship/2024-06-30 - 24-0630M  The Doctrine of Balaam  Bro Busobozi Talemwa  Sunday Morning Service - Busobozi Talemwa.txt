education in Ireland irand so then she received the message and uh so she she now came back to Uganda for her holid as a Believer and so her pastor not actually in Ireland it is some some part in the in the other part of the UK so our pastor sent me greetings and he also sent you greetings his name is brother Oliver so let us um go to the Book of Revelation chapter two brother Marin You' have to be very steady because I'm going to do a lot of reading today and you have to show the people what I'm reading maybe for you to prepare you would have to go to the church edge book is where we're going to read a lot this morning so we are reading Revelation 2: [Music] 14 everybody there if you're there just say Amen if you do not have a Bible I would encourage you to kindly get a Bible it's very important for a Christian to have a Bible by the time I was I think I had I had had about two or three old Bibles that I had used and warned and was getting another another one now I don't know how many have used you should please find yourself a Bible so we are reading Revelation 2 14 but I have a few things okay we can begin from verse 12 so we can get the whole the whole portion and to the angel of the Church of in pegamos write these things sayth he which has the sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and has not denied my faith even in those days where in antipast was my faithful matter who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold doctrine of balam who taught balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication for [Music] okay so uh we can be seated may the Lord bless the reading of his word this morning amen uh I sister are not here but I know of Sister Rose who still in Tanzania traveling [Music] back and I'm happy to see my father there who just also came in amen now Saints uh today I'm going to speak on the I'm going to speak on the doctrine of balam doctr of bam um is a lot to speak about and um the best way for me to be able to give you what the prophet said is to quote it so today just like we did on Friday I will do a lot a lot of reading and I'm sorry for my hor voice I've been preaching quite a bit in the past several days so I'm going to be doing a lot of quoting and reading but we shall just see how the Lord will lead us and um we we see just uh pray pray for me and pray that God will be able to speak to you let us also read in Jude 1 who unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran gridly after the era of balam for the reward for reward and perished in gain saying of of of [Music] okay um we will also read we would have read this all while we were standing but uh uh I just wanted you to sit so we can read let us look at First Corinthians chapter 10s if you have you would want to not down a few things today if you have a pen and paper now these things were our ex examples to the intent we should not last after evil things as they also last vers seven neither be ye idolators or idolators as were some of them as it is written the the people sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play neither let us Comm commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day 3 and 20,000 that's verse seven and 8 [Music] praise the Lord ask your neighbor are you ready for the word this morning amen did they say they are ready I want to hear an amen okay that means everybody is ready there there are many things that God can tolerate but there is one thing that God cannot tolerate and that is immorality what he calls here fornication oh your wife is here this morning brother God bless you so much huh oh okay I did not receive any note here so I did not realize so this is you're so welcome was he received already H okay this is the new brother can we join our hands to welcome him amen uh he went to uh uh to console and and bu for a brother and in addition to that God gave him Grace hear the message on the funeral service and he believed it and was baptized amen so there is no loss to the Believers so we we should have consolation sister have consolation that you lost a son daughter but God gave you a son amen hallelujah and so we we we are we we feel sorry for what happened we are so thankful to the Lord that he knows how to make everything beautiful and he said in everything we should give thanks and I'm so happy that you are here with your wife this morning smiling happy because you in the Pres of that's what a Believer is no matter what happens you should always be thankful to the yeah of course it's not easy when you are in the valley but the god of the of the mountain the god of the V and we as Believers should always learn that and accept him and believe him and love him and serve him no matter which situation we are in praise the Lord amen if the deacons will want to help there I have some other like three or four seats here so maybe I see some people are struggling because of the pillars they can't see properly you can talk to them if they want to change [Music] their so this morning I just want to speak on the on the doctrine of balam and I was saying that there are many things that God can um you know be patient with um there are many things he can I don't wouldn't say compromise but I can say can be patient and um you know you can be a believer and going struggling this and that one thing that God is not patient fornication adultery immorality in fact I talked about it one time and I F forication and so and I showed you by the how fornication is very dangerous both physically and spiritually and how fornication can actually make you miss the Rapture and how fornication can actually cause you to be disfellowshipped from the fellow is the only thing that I know of that can actually make you be this Fellowship that is if you continue walking in that life having been corrected but you resist correction is the thing that I know that God HS is almost impossible for someone to be spiritually fine if they are physically working in immorality and it is Al impossible if somebody is working physically in immorality to be spiritually fine the physical types the spiritual what do you see in the physical in someone's life it shows what they are in the spiritual praise the name of the Lord and so we see the doctrine of balam balam is one man that we will we have a lot to read and a lot to cover but here he says I have a few things against you speaking to the Saints in um in in pamos because you have them there that hold the doctrine of balam so God was not happy with the church age of P because they had those people who had a doctrinal balance and he says balam taught balac how to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel he also told them to eat things sacrificed to idols and also he told them to commit fornication we we we will not because of time read there but you can actually have time later on and read in the Book of Numbers chapter 22 23 24 25 in these chapters in numbers he shows everything that bam did but I'll just go a little ahead of myself and tell you thisam tried everything to bring down the Church of the Church of Israel he could not Prevail he could not cast it he could not bring it down but the only thing that he used to bring it down was fornication was immorality and I'd like us to get into the doctr of balam today and see hoping that we shall learn a lot of things this morning so this may not be your kind of service where you are shouting and very happy but you you will learn a lot but every believer anywhere every word of God will make you shout brother I'm going to begin with a resume of Ages I believe every believer of the end time message should at least read the church age book and finish it I remember in we read it with the young people and went through it almost almost line by line word by word it was a very big blessing and so he says here now watch this doctrine of balam most carefully notice above all that it is the deliberate maneuver of a corrupt clery the clergy or the preachers who are corrupt [Music] to bind the people to them by Leading the People deliberately into the scene of unbelief before I continue I will tell you right here one ways we Believers of the message are very different from the other denominations is that in the message we do noty B people to ourselves as preachers no we bind people to the word you know you are not my people you are the people of God but in the denominations the people will be the pastors people when the man of God says anything you just have to B as long as the man as long as the word of God did not say no matter who says it it doesn't matter the nicolan doctrine was the corruption of the clergy as they sought political power amongst themselves while bism you know they were they were seeking for political power while Bamm the subjection of the people to their system of creed and worship in order to hold to them now watch this carefully what was it that bound the people to the nominal church and thereby destroyed them it was the Creeds and dogmas formed in their Church tenants it was the doctrine of of the Roman Catholic Church many of you were from those denominations whereby you know you were subjected to a set of doctrines you know so that they can bind you to that denomination they ask you what is your religion then you say well I'm a Protestant I an angc I am a Muslim I am you know a Baptist and you are bound to them some of them like the Adventists they even make you sign somewhere the moment they baptize you in their Church they make you sign somewhere you know their baptism is that what baptizes you into their denomination and so you are now their slave forever but this end time message came to set us free from all because that is the doctrine of the niol listen carefully now they were not given the True Food the word they were given the food that came from idol worship Babylonian paganism wrapped up in Christian [Music] terminology and they and and that very same spirit and Doctrine is Right amongst all Protestants and it is called denomination you find them doing certain things teaching certain doctrines having certain mannerism [Music] and and ways of behavor but when you search the scripture you don't find it nowhere and now the prophet here tells you you find that in all the Roman Catholic protest denomination and he says that spirit is called denomination and we Believers of this message are not a denomination nanism is organization humanizing the leadership of the church e e the leadership of the home Christ is supposed to be the head and and the head is the word the holy spirit so whereby you are leading your family by the word so you find that that same spirit in churches even some message churches whereby people will obey their pastor and their Bishop more than they were some of them will even go to to an extent of saying if you're not in group you are doomed forever because we are the ones who have the truth and ask them why is it you they will say because our man is the one that God sent let me tell you the message has taken us Beyond man the message has brought us to a place where it is no longer a humanized leadership is the Holy Ghost leadership we are not led by man we are led by the spirit we are led by the word but the spirit of NIS will always be disposing the spirit people just do what Their pastor wants listen to me I don't care what I want don't follow what I want follow what the word say follow what the Holy Ghost to do amen if a man is a man of God he will be sensitive to the leadership of the Holy Spirit from him and from the people bism is denominationalism which takes the church manual instead of the Bible everybody ismism it takes the church man this is what we believe we believe a d and that's all we believe if you bring some more they will tell you you have a false Doctrine I don't know some of you if you have ever gone to these churches you say something new that they don't know they don't care whether it is here or not all they care about is we don't know it here in our CH but in the message we have the anointing of a flying eagle amen hallelujah I've preached to you for three years here but there are more things I've never preached in the not that you shall have preachers who will come here and prach things which I've never preached and I don't think there is one single message preacher has preached everything I don't think there is they have not preached everything because there is more in God there is always more they they made themselves Catholic they said we believe this this this this we We Believe this this this this we are Pentecostal we believe this and you find some even message Believers making groups among themselves we believe this but let me tell you what makes us not to be a denomination is that we do not have an end to what we believe do you know why because we believe in God Amen and God you can never finish it there is more in God there is more in God Amen just keep digging keep digging into the word every day you will find there is more there is more you can never finish it hallelujah amen oh my there is more in God that's why even in one single service the more you say Amen the more God releases himself the more you say Amen the god releases preachers will agree with me sometimes you go in a place people are so D they are not receiving the word and you'll preach as someone and get closed down you go somewhere else people are receiving you preach the same suon and things will happen What is the difference amen it's the people that are drawing from God it's like if I give you a drink with a straw on it and I ask and I tell you pull pull and you just put your mouth and pull once and say this is enough there is no more well you will go thirsty but if you keep pulling if you keep pulling you can never finish what is inside amen is the well of water that never runs dry amen is's a River of Life Hallelujah that's why we say amen that's why we Rejoice at the because we are pulling on the how many to pull on Amen we don't we don't have a church manual here we do not have a church manual We are following every in the Bible everything we know everything we've been told whatever more God will reveal Hallelujah and right to this hour many of God's people are C in the snare of denominationalism and God is crying to them come out of her my people that you be not partakers of our sins and that he receive not her plagues you see they are ignorant but if the Rapture should take place at this moment ignorance would be no court of appeal from the Judgment of God for being in the wrong run I didn't know Lord I was in my religion I believe told me I didn't know let me tell you brother you want said that we have been given a message comfort zone we leave our comfort zones we read the message we listen to the message we listen we eat we pull we Lear we grow when learning comes when the comes you will not say I did not know I I mean I was just I was just a good believer being a good believer will not take in the Rapture amen you need to pull El you need to pull on him so that you can receive strength for the to organize themselves with one rank over another this one is a pastor this one is a bishop this one is this is General overseer and the other one is Chief superintendent and the other one is the president and the other one is whatever they give themselves one rank over another until they are finally headed by a president is and this is a manifestation of the Antichrist regardless of how wonderful and necessary it may seem let me tell you friends all Ministers of this precious message are the same God uses them different because God is a god of variety there is no one single Pastor or Minister there is above another some of you love me so much until you think I'm the best that is but I've always told you I'm one little on the [Music] beach God can to do away with me so his other minister but all of them are important in the hands of and so there is no one who has a rank above we are told to H elders that doesn't mean that they have a rank higher are you following me Church you know they all continue you know ranking and ranking until you have a president that is a presiding officer soal but let me tell you our presiding offic is Jesus Christ Hallelujah it is not nothing but human reasoning taking the place of the [Music] word and any person who is in the organized denomination is right in the midst of an antichrist system now let me say this and make it very plain I am not against the people I am against the system am when we talk about these things we are not talking about the people in those churches we talking about the system praise the name of the Lord and so we shall go um in another portion brother brother Marvin now in the P Church age and it begins by quoting Revelation 214 thou Hast there them that hold a doct of balam who told balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication and he says now you just can't have a nicolan set up in the church and not have the other [Music] you see if you take away the word of God and the moving of the spirit as a means of worship then you will have to give people another form of worship as a substitute and substitution spells bism God has set up his church on the day of Pentecost and he called it you know it was the church at Pentecost listen church and that church had two things that God was using to lead that church the first was the word they had the pure word they told today we have it here today the word the second was the spirit how many remember the holy ghost coming down on the only a few only a few remember right the Holy Ghost came down the Bible says they were all praying they were all waiting upon God and on that day they had a sound as a sound of a rushing mighty And Then There came pillars of fire a pillar of fire listen closely CH and this Pillar of Fire divided itself in different leaks leaks of fire and each leak of fire rested upon one person upon one person for one person how did they it make them feel now we've had people who say that we don't need emotion because the holy spirit is not emotional I agree with them in part that the Holy Ghost is not emotion because you can actually have emotion when it has nothing to do with the Holy Spirit many of you have been emotional this week maybe someone someone gave you money and you were so emotional or maybe someone you know did something for you and you so happy others just cry you know we emotional in different ways you find some someone just cries without saying a word when they've been overwhelmed you just tears another one they just shout just because they happy and others they just fall down pass out simply because they happy you know there are different ways depending on how God made you we are all not the same that not so Brethren so now in the same way when the Holy Ghost comes upon you you know he will have it is is not emotion but he will have an emotional experience and I I put it this way that the Holy Ghost is not emotional but he is emotional are you hearing me if I give you money do I have money here I don't know who is now thinking I'm going to give them M so I have money here you see if I give you money brother and I'm giving it to you for real by the way I'm not going to take it back so if I give you money are you happy or you're not no you don't know how to be happy I'm going to take it away from you if you're not happy I'll give you to someone else this is 10,000 it's not small money if I give you money this brother is he does not know how to be emotional who knows how to be happy who want this money come here one person quickly I'll give it to if you know how to if you know oh this is your money now my sister oh hallelujah hallelujah now you see Sister Sister fortunate received this money and she was smiling thank you thank you thank but now is that emotion the money I've given her are you following me but the money caus that to be emotional the emotion was there because something happened amen God bless you with your money s now in the same way I want you to understand this in the same way Amen brother I will also give you your listen listen in the same same way when the Holy Ghost comes upon you you know he is not emotional but has come upon you and you will become emotional you must have emotion because the Holy Ghost is life the Holy Ghost is power amen the Holy Ghost is the manifestation of the real power and the person of God hallelujah and when he comes upon you can you remind the same you cannot remain the same some people they say I receive the Holy Ghost while dreaming it is impossible no amen you would have to know you would have to desire it you have to ask for it you have to wait upon him and when you are filled with the power of the Holy Ghost you will have life with it are you following me now so you see the first church when the Holy Ghost came down just as a leak of fire Came Upon you see a woman called Mary the mother of Jesus Amen you know what happened you know the Catholics think she was always very you know that's why they go to he to her mother of God let me tell you when she received the Holy Ghost in the she must have and then shouted and began to speak in Tong Mary spoke in Tong how many beli say Amen Mary spoke in Tong and our religion was not formal her religion was not dead her religion had life on it and our Prophet said if you religion and is speaking to Believers by so if your religion is very dead and formal leave that one if it has no emotion it it is dead it is good for nothing and I will give you another one which has emotional which will make you shout which will make you clap your hands and hold which will make you be a real real P amen and that religion they received was the old time religion we believe in and the Holy Spirit when he came he began leading them to the truth you know he began leading them yeah they had Peter as the pastor but Peter was not the one leading them it was the Holy Spirit leading amen through the preachers and the others but the Holy Spirit and the word they all said and preached the same Doctrine and the Holy Spirit Led them and and you know heal the people signs wonders Miracles that is why if you are to believe does not have the power of God to vindicate it it is dead you should be like that brother who came and said if God his name was Gideon gide he said if God be with us where are his miracles you know the angel of the Lord came and talk to him and said Gideon you are a man of God God is with you he said no no don't deceive me don't deceive me and people are accepting to go in churches where they telling them God is with you God is with you wait a moment be like Gideon if God be with us where are his miracles you should hunger you should thirst to see the manifestation of the spirit and power of God where you go and pray and God moves and does a miracle amen where you come in a church and T go out an interpretation go out where you come in church and prophecy goes out by there are the supernatural signs amen I don't know how I can express tell True Religion the true gospel has always had the supernatural around it you cannot take out the supernatural from the true church and the moment we SE to see it it means the seed of bamis and the seed of has come among us we should always desire to see God moving in our midst whereby you have a habit you're trying to fight the habit but you pray you go in fting and prayer and God moves and gives you victory over that amen whereby God comes down and as you I don't know about you but me I don't want a religion where I am Bound in chain and I cannot be delivered and if it's the one you are having I'm telling you you can bu it we have a fresh one where you'll come and say I'm struggling with this and God will deliver you I've seen God deliver so many amen I'm one of them amen the Apostle Paul said even as we were in sins and trespasses delivered us the Kingdom of Light now let us study this Spirit of bism a little more okay brother rang you would have to have more voice because we are going for one hour more if we are going to understand what do ofam is in the New Testament Church we had better go back and see what it was in the Old Testament and then we apply it to that third third age and then bring it up to the present and so he says the the story is found in numbers chapters 22 through 2 [Music] so just so you can go and read it if we read it it will take 30 minutes now we know that Israel was the chosen people of God they were the pcal of their day do we have Pentecostals of today they had taken Refuge under the blood and they had all been baptized in the Red Sea and they came up out of the waters singing in the spirit and dancing under the energy of the Holy Ghost I love that when I he amen youi took a tambourine dancing oh praise God hallelujah and and and you know josu and others they began dancing but you know people of today they even fear to dance for Jesus it is a sign you are not yet delivered if you can't dance for Jesus it means you are dancing somewhere else for another but let me tell you I don't want the devil to take away my D Satan can take away anything but he can't take away my dance you can't take away my joy you can't take away my happiness my rejoicing for Jesus because my joy amen for Jesus is my strength amen the joy of a Believer is her strength your strength is not in money or in what the world will give you our strength is in our joy when you are joyful in the Lord there are many people in the Bible who encourage themselves in the Lord how do you encourage yourself in the Lord when you are going through tough time it is by Joy having joy in the Lord in the Holy Ghost you remember that woman a prophet spoke about how her husband was very tough on him and uh one time you know the the man said to have two drunken friends let's go at my home and I will show you who a genuine Christian is you know if you're married your husband or your wife really knows whether you are a genuine Christian right so then he came and brought them and told you know the woman the wife to make for them some food eggs and when she made the eggs uh the man just you know they came behaving as if they were drunk but they were not drunk that and the man just kicked it splashed everywhere and um he said this is not what I asked for make me a better one if you are the sister in that marriage what do you do these days they run away because they don't have the joy of the Lord but if you have the joy of the Lord you will know I cannot run away from my marriage I want run away from my family I'm going to encourage myself in the Lord and she started Jesus bear the cross alone the world go free there a cross for every andoss for me she was joyful inside and by singing the Bible says is there anyone mared let them sing so you can't sing unless you're happy so she was F ins even when she was going through trouble amen and so the joy of the Lord is our no matter what you are going through no matter the what where life is taking you always encourage yourself in the lord the devil can't understand that that's why the devil tries to frustrate take away your joy never agree with him never agree with his sadness never agree with his depression never agree with his frustration always agree with one thing word always be joyful always be joyful sister always be joyful my brother regardless of what life brings and [Music] always be joyful tell your neighbor always be joyful and you can't always be joyful unless you have the Holy Ghost so these ones were singing in the spirit they were dancing under the energy of the Holy Ghost while Miriam the prophet played her tambourin well after a certain time of Journey these children of Israel came to Moab so now they were coming from Egypt to the promised land and have cross the Red Sea and now they were going to Moab brother they were going through they going to go through the land of Moab you remember who Moab was he was the son of lot by one of his own daughters and Lord in turn was a nephew of Abraham so Israel and Moab were related I want you to see that the moabites knew the truth whether they lived up to it or not they knew it there are many people who are related to us as believers they know the truth but they don't believe it some of them they know it so much even more than some of let us first track a little bit of the genealogy of balam and B you know seeing here that bam was actually a son the B says the son of or whatever and B was a son of laan andan was um was a son of Bethel and whom he begot through milka and then you know who was a son of Haron and Har was a son of Tera and Tera was also the father of Abraham so in other words balam came from Tera and Abraham came from Terra these people were also related but now Bak as we have seen already by the prophet here he was a son he was a king of the moabites and the moabites were Moab came was a son one of the sons of lot you remember when God was you know destroying Sodom and gomorra and how say that now you know run don't look back and they were running you know lot and his two daughters and his [Music] wife but his wife looked back became a pillar of soul and so his daughters said to themselves look we are now left alone by ourselves what are we going to do we need to have children the whole city is gone and so they gave their father alcohol and he got drunk and then they had children with him and so the the each of the girls had children one was I believe Ammon and another one was Moab and so we see that Moab brother Moab was a son of lot but lot was also a son of of har did you get that and actually there is a part here that is so interesting which I might have confused a little bit but I'll correct it here for youon listen closely who was also a son of Terror gave birth to a girl called mil and now you know got married to a man called was a brother to Haron how many are following you're not confused right so and Har were brothers they were all sons of teror so now har the brother of God gave birth to a daughter called milka and so milka got married by how many got it so in other words got married there's a reason why I'm going through this got married to her uncle the brother to the father have you got it if you have got it say Amen good now now is the one who gave birth to Bethel with and now out of Beth comes laan comes and then comes Prophet you see the confusion he came out of Bal was also a relative to Abraham but he also came from another confusion he was he was a you know he was Mo a moabit which means he came from incest you get a point whereby lot with his daughter gave birth to Mo and balak was the king of the moabites the ones who came from [Music] incest but lot was also a son of har who was a brother of Abraham so both balam and and B were relatives to Abraham are you hearing me but the confusion of the prophecies and the desire of King Bal shows you why because the genealogy back there was out of Fusion but when you go in the Lage that God LED that God used that God was defending that God was fighting for you don't see any Corners like that straight from from ter God comes down he leaves he lives amen and he comes to a man called Abraham and he says Abraham your your brothers have children but you don't have but I've chosen you because I want to make a nation out of you let me tell you sometimes God can leave his own to be baren so that he can make a nation for himself don't hurry when everybody else is getting married and then you get under pressure oh can I get let me just go with this no brother no sister wait upon God be led by the Holy Ghost hear the voice of God and Abraham when he he had the voice of God his wife was bed God said Don't You Worry AB I'm going to raise a nation out of you out of you will come a great nation out of you whoever will bless you I will bless whoever will cast you I will cast I have made a covenant with you ab and Abraham listen to the voice of God and out of Abraham and Isaac amen and out of Isaac came Jacob and out of Jacob Moses and all the Israelites as we know glory to God this was a whole a ho Lage they were Royals they were special even today they are when you talk about Palestine you talk about these Arab Nations let me announce to you today all of them are sons of Abraham all of them have you not heard of the Abraham Accords the treaty which Israel was trying to sign USA was trying to make them sign an agreement between isra and the Arab Nations with this idea all of you are brothers you are all from Abraham unite you get a point all of them are sons of Abraham because even when you go to the other tribes the isites you know who came from ha that one came even from Abraham direct and they also had many many tribes and even those who did not come directly from abrah they came from the father of Abraham who was teror so you can clearly see they all the same people but there was a holy lineage a lineage God could not compromise he said these ones are mine and he heard them from the very beginning they were B and he made them fruitful said a blessing upon you no one can be able to Cur you and start your family I'll be with you you will have children they will have children wherever you go I'll go with you now I believe today we have that same rest among the Gentiles that is a Christian rest amen whereby God has said you are a holy priesthood royal priesthood you a holy nation amen why he said in blessing I'll bless you I I take that blessing as my own blessing he said I'll cast them that cast you no one can bring down this end time message the end time message we are talking about did not start today it started with a here in the Bible the teachings they taught is what we are teaching today the things they believed is what we are believing today it has been seven Church ages from the days of apostle Paul until the days of William Bram of teaching the same thing the same lineage the same line blessing how many believe they a part of that blessing and Israel blessed as they were they came through the land Moab we now know the land of Moab it was a l were relatives of Abraham now listen carefully because the prophet would say that balac actually feared Abraham meaning he feared the Israelites so Israel came up to the border of Moab are you listening church are you listening that's 10% of you are you listening all right the other brother did not answer me God bless you listen so Israel came up to the borders of Moab and S and sent Messengers to the king and they said this we are brothers let us pass through your land if our people our animals eat or drink anything we will gladly pay for [Music] it they just wanted to go through but one part cat caught my eye here they were not poor they could pay for all expens hallelu listen have you ever heard of this we are pilgrims and we are strangers we are just passing through Hallelujah but we are not poor while we are passing through so if you are poor find where your blessings have gone and we shall see here how Israel became po poor they became impoverished because of this Spirit of balam this doctr of bamis made them poor they said we willing to pay for everything but King B got very excited that head of that niol Bunch was not about to let the church come through with its signs and wonders and diverse manifestations of the Holy Ghost did you hear what I just read to you this Bunch the Israelites with them they had signs with them they had wonders with them they had D manifestation and balak King balak feared that you are going through my land with their faces shining with the glory of God it was too risky as he might lose some of his Crow my my you people missed it don't let the spirit of ofam catch you and then you miss what I'm preaching the of and the spirit of Jezebel and the spirit of n they work in coroporation so the spe of Jezebel can come and attack and make you not to hear the word the spirit of bam will catch you and make you not see what God is saying so please focus and listen to what the Holy Spirit speak the kind of things I'm speaking today are exposing spirits and demons and usually when that happens there is a battle some of you who are spiritual could even feel spiritual but it's a battle it's a fight and I didn't come here to play I came here to consume those demons I came here to do that and so I'm trying I even ask the the deacons you please help us and the people please don't do a lot of movements because you're disturbing the flow of the Holy Spirit and when that happens you notice that it begins to shift and you know people begin to miss what the holy spirit is [Music] saying just stay focused and avoid for Le a few more minutes just listen to what I'm saying here King balak got very excited that head of the nian buch was not about to let the church come through with his signs and wonders and diverse manifestations of the Holy G with their faces shining with the glory of God it was too risky as he might lose some of the the crowd in other words balak was afraid of the glory of God upon these people let me tell you when someone has a speed of on them they fear the supernatural when the supernatural comes say you are excited when a supernatural comes they say you are emotional but if you are on the side of the israelit to you the Supernatural is a part of you signs and wonders are a part of us amen the manifestation of the Holy Ghost they are a part of us the glory of God shining Upon Our let me tell you you cannot fail to see someone with the glory of when when Moses came from the mountains and they looked at him his V was shining the Bible says they could not even look on [Music] him where are you coming from what have you been doing this week what have you been into what are you putting your life into it is either taking away the glory putting the glory on and you can L see it when you're looking at a person you can see there something Shadow on them you can't understand what it is usually what I do I ask them how are you I'm fine but how are you because I'm seeing that sh there's no glory a child of God you must always be sh Glory do not let things take away that Glory failed it was so risky to let people come in with that Glory because they might influence his some of his crowd to go with them are you hearing me are you hearing me that's why as pastors we don't protect are people it is God who does it is God who does someone goes to I can't even direct them anywhere because I'm fearing if they go they might not come back and maybe they were giving me some good typ money let me tell you I don't fear such those things I don't own anyone no p no Pastor owns anyone and if God wanted you to be under my Ministry you will be under my Ministry why because I know what I'm preaching is the truth and let me tell you I have no Ministry amen the only Ministry that I have is the ministry of Malachi 4 in our generation amen the message of the hour calling us to come out come out of denomination come out from the spirit of balance and be set and liberated under the Holy Ghost the two teachings of the word had a false doctr and he fear to mingle he fear those people because they had a contagious spirit let me tell you evil spirits are contagious yes look around if you feel heavy in your eyes look around you someone is doing around and and change the SE yes the speed of heav can come on you because someone else has it the truth by the that is the truth these demons are contagious in the meeting sometimes brother would be Discerning and he would say there's a spirit there female trouble and I say oh someone else here oh they're trying to fight they're trying to coordinate and and resist the Holy Spirit and then what would he do he would expose them immediately that woman that woman you are all set free you are all healed and the moment that happens people are liberated fre so you see demons are contagious and they always call for support even while I'm preaching by the way while I'm preaching while preachers preach demons call for help so the holy spirit is contagious if you come inside the buch of people that are holy go people that love the world people that love God people that are joyful in their heart you cannot remain the same if you come you came here today today if you came here when you have a spirit of heav on you even while you are heing the world you are being set free sometimes amen it's not even what I'm saying you the brother saying amen or the sister that can set free someone so B refused to let Israel pass through in fact so great was his fear of them that he went to an hearing Prophet called remember bam was also a relative of his was a hiring because he was not from the linage of the Israelites are there prophets true prophets out there not in the message yes plenty but there many of them are of the likes of bam we are looking at the doctrine of balam and asked him to meditate between him and God Med between him and God and petition the almighty to C Israel and to render the Israelites import and Bam being eager to take part in political affairs and become a great man was only too glad to do so there might be people that will cooperate with Satan to try and make you importance they are eager to do so but they cannot Prevail they cannot that I knew many years ago when God revealed to me who I was a Son of God a royal lineage no matter what weapons will be F against they could not Prosper amen they went and and tried and but seeing that he had to approach to and receive an audience from God to get the people cast as he could not do it by himself he went to ask God if he could have his permission to go now isn't that just like the niol we have with us today they cast everyone that want go their way you living my church The Blessing is going with you as a matter of fact I'm cursing you some of you have been in such churches I'm the blessing of God for you and if you don't want to stay here you go you don't have my blessing in other words you going with a car my blessing is not with any my blessing is with the message of the hour my blessing is with God why because he called me because he elected me because he knew me even before the foundation of the world and he predestinated me to be his son I am un I am unable it is impossible amen hallelujah Hallelujah am as long as I'm still working with Jesus the of my soul I am uncastable put it on your lips I am unable that is the doctrine of of the nians they C everyone that W go their way h H listen when bam asked God for permission to go God turned him down God said no you can't C my that St it St like a be but Bak insisted promising him even greater B insisted and promising him even great rewards and horor so went back to God now one answer from God should have been enough but not for the selfed When you pray and God answers you and you still come back and pray and come it means you have your own will you want your own will to be done but brother when God speaks once God can't speak twice take what he says in his word God has already spoken the lion has already Ro the message has already G God can't change it in any area of our Liv be it marriage be it family be it and family and the church and Ministry and gifts and callings God has already spoken by his word you find a woman preacher going to God oh God did you call me confirm to me God has already spoken first Timothy Chapter 2 I forid a woman toach or to accept Authority it is the word of God God has already spoken now I agree you as a woman preacher you can go and ask God and God can tell you go there are many who have testimonies that is they are under the anointing of they have their self will God never said for them to go but God gave them a permissive way as we shall see here and so B continued insisting can I please go when God saw his pervers he told him to get up and go all right you can go oh I can go and go God Has Told spoken to me wait if God has spoken to you whatever he say you agree with the word if he doesn't agree with the word I don't care what voice you have you are not in the perfect way when God so go him stand up and go quickly he s the donkey and way he went he should have realized that this was simply God's permissive and he wouldn't be able to cast them if he went 20 times and 20 and 20 and tried 20 times how like balam are people today they believe in three Gods get baptized in three titles instead of the and yet God will send the spirit upon them as he did upon and they will go on believing they are exactly right and here they are actually perfect who told you that Pentecostals don't have the moving of the spirit there are some fake ones but there are some who truly have of the even healing happens they speak in true T some of them and interpret them and some mess Believers when they so you mean God is also here sister God is everywhere but the question is the will of God and yet you know God was not with them so they go on believing they they teach in three gods they don't baptize in the right name but God still gives them and when I said SP I mean the anointing go ahead anyway go ahead anyway go ahead anyway the of do it your way they say well God has blessed us it must be all right and what do they mean God has blessed us we now have built a mega church they tell if God is not with us if you're saying God did not send this woman how come she has built this big Tabernacle see see the church show you do you have a church like that and then you will look at the person and tell them no and then you will laugh and God has blessed them he has 10,000 congregation he hased the need she has done is it true it's all true so they say God has blessed us it must be all right I know he has blessed you I don't deny that but it is the same organization route thatal took it's defance to God is work it false teaching do you know of any denomination in the world that God has blessed like the Roman Catholic look at the buildings the most beautiful look at the people there is no church in the world that has big numbers like the Roman Cath look at the organizations they the systems they have bu but yet the Roman Catholic Church is right in the heart of Revelation 17 mystery Babylon the Bible says she has made the people of God and the kings of the world to commit spiritual fornication filled with the wine of forication and she goes giving them what is this it is the false Doctrine it's the false teaching which are against the word and yet God has blessed them more than everybody it's not what we are looking at it is the Defiance to God's word it's your first teaching the Church of God the Church of the elect has always been the Chosen Few never the majority by the way go back go back to church history you will see what I'm saying it has always been the minority never the majority the Bible even says blessed is the little flock is the kingdom of God the way that leads to Heaven is narrow and straight straight and narrow but the weather leads to hell and find it me that we are the few does not mean we are the F being that we are the few is a Vindication we are the ones the truth that is a bibical teaching but always people love the numbers the crowd and so this man was looking at the money was looking at the power and this was the anointing he was having to preach by the way many preachers today what you see think it is anointing it is indeed their God they they have they have the calling they even know the word but when they begin to preach the manifestations you see you think it is because of the anointing of the spirit but the energy they have is to get influence money a name and many of them also to lead the scripture said silly women cap scure and these things are in our generation so we need to have the spirit of designment we need to know what we stand for we need to know what we believe so balam went w widely down the road until angel from God stood in his way oh God has called me oh the anointing of God is me I already feel the anointing when I reach there I believe he was exising people [Music] say the Lord he sent me I met him behind the Rock and I told him God can I go and he told me you can go myself side was he saying the truth and so I'm here Divine oration I have come to Cur all of you it was in his head while he was on the donkey and on top of that he would see himself do that and he would see himself get all the money get all the power get all the clothes I'm going to be a great man all he had was a donkey now he was chariot you remember like n n was not having a donkey was having chariots because he was a great man so he was seeing himself in the Chariot boys let's go yeah I'm going to be blessed I'm going to be lifted oh I'm going to be powerful brother sister that's a spirit of bam the spirit of wanting to lift yourself above what God has made you the spirit of Pride wanting to be above everybody else humble yourself sister humble yourself if you humble yourself God will lift you but if you try to lift yourself I'm not I'm not cursing you I'm simply saying if you try to lift yourself God will bring you down so you better humble yourself but this man n he was seeing these things in his head he was counting you know when you know money is coming some of you have who have been very good with with striking deals you're looking at him but you know you're when you are counting and you see money the one who was even working humbly you become proud money is coming you even go to the B how much is this one it is 500 million but it's not very good what about this one 800 million yeah let me see can I can I do it but payment is can you pay don't wor leave that for me because he knows the deal is about to pass that's how was that's how was yes brethren we should not be like we should we should not go into that business of striking deals to beet no God does not work like can I say God does not work like humble yourself and accept to grow slowly Hallelujah if you don't have an education and you can still attain it go to school learn study pass your exams come out ask God for job she will give you a job go get a job don't be ly but because this generation is very they are just very busy looking for deals everywhere they are very busy on Google a searching how can I make one 100 million in one night and then will tell you you can go in Forex Trading you can do this and you find a man brother sister doesn't have a job doesn't have anything but they speak as if they're millionaire becausei is deceiving instead of going to the word they they have a speed of learn to go and work God never said he's going to give you Miracle money God said he will bless the work of your hands so you have to go and walk go and sweat if it means to sweep go and sweep if you have no job look for one you can find it so that you can have money to serve God but having a job does not mean you should not come to church and serve God [Music] I'm why to veryy I'm working no that again is the Same Spirit of trying to look for money that you forget the God who will bless you to find that money how can he bless the work of your hands if you are not going to serve him with your so you see the spirit of balam is real they very B striking deals looking for the the deal which will burst quickly the prophet told us that is against the get rich quick overnight schem you see them all over us if you give 50,000 and you recruit 10 people you will make this in just just one month two months and people have lost Millions some of them even borrow money and they put their small compy instead of bringing it to the land fund you are holding the money you are holding it and then you throw it in some of let me tell you if you have money and you don't know what to do with it give it to the Lord give it to the Lord he will mply it and when I say the Lord I'm not meaning myself I mean give it to the work of God bring it here we use it to buy the church land and there is nothing you can give God and God doesn't give back to you but you find them throwing their money schemes they think they will get money by reasoning and thinking those Pon schemes are demonic they satanic they are not of God why because it has the spirit of Bon getting rich overnight getting rich quickly without hustling and that's not right it's the same speed of B that makes the boys go behind the and begin contacting sisters and the sister also the spirit of comes I don't need to tell the P I will just finish this deal quickly and then we shall go to him when it is done and then when things bust always when those deals bust they bust the side the wrong side and then you begin blaming everyone blame the spirit ofam that caused you not to go God's provided way because we have blessed the word for you but if you don't follow it who is to be blamed if you can't blame yourself then blame the spirit you submitted to but I pray church that we be able to go God's provided way it will never cause you any heartbreak it will always give you unexpected end praise the name of the Lord if you want to invest in the prophet said invest in a company that is well proved over a period of time trusted and you were sure to get out your return there are many companies like those but I'll tell you one which is proved over and over and over over is the company of the word if you invest your time if you invest your money invest your resources in serving God always expect a return Hallelujah and the return will be more than you expected Now give me more a few more minutes like 20 normally I would be done by now it is one but just us continue for a few more minutes because I may not you don't come on Wednesday so I want to finish up this all right listen there he to block the Mad Prophet now okay I just go back a little bit here all right so balam went wildly down the road until an angel from God stood in his way but that Prophet Bishop that Cal that chairman that president that General overseer meaning they have the big titles but they are blind to the word that Prophet was so blinded to spiritual things the thought of honor and glory and money that he could not see the angel standing with a drone SW Brethren let us have spiritual you go back on the service I preached on Wednesday the danger of of tur down the word turn down the word and when you turn down the word God will blind your eyes you can't see and the angel was standing there with but was blind as a praise God there he stood there he stood to block the Mad Prophet the little donkey saw him and dodged back and forth finally crashed Bam's foot the ass stopped would not go on he could not soam jumped off and began be the donkey then began to talk God let that donkey speak in a tongue that donkey was no hybrid original if God could make an original breed seed donkey speak in [Applause] Tong how much more will he make the original Church speak in time he the same God this was not a mule it was a donkey original and it began speaking he said to the blinded Prophet am I not your donkey and I carried you Faithfully still blinded reply yes yes you are my donkey and you have cared me Faithfully until now and if I can't get you going I'm going to kill you what's that talking talking to a donkey that's funny I thought I had had the donkey talking and I was answering back God has always spoken in a tongue he spoke at baz's feast and then at Pentecost he is doing it today again hallelujah amen when a tongue is from God it is not to confuse is to bring Clarity forget about these Tong that they do in their and then you ask them what does it I'm just praying in the it's all right but do it in your private closet but in the church if you speak in a tongue it should be interpreted either by you or by another person it should be interpreted that's the T we see on the Pentecost that's the the T we see here when the donkey spoke at the Feast of the king and you know it's the same T if they do not need interpretation it was what people could hear if they couldn't hear needed interpretation nonetheless we believe in tongues some Churches of the message because was trying to straighten this thing out they they got a bias on tongues when you hear them preaching it's like they're preaching against them for us we believe in them as a matter of fact if they are not there in our church we need to have another touch but thank God we've seen it happen here many many many times and I say we want more of it Lord what is it is usually a message from God himself to the church it's a warning of sooncoming judgment then the was made a visible to balam he told balam that except for the donkey he would be dead even now but when balam promised to go back he was sent on with admonition to say only what God gave you listen to this next words so balam went down and set up oh my this this this really moved me set up seven altars for the clean Beast of sacrifice he killed the signy the coming of the Mah he knew what to do to approach unto God now listen he had the mechanics just right but not the Dynamics same as now can't you see it nans there was Israel down there in the valley offering the same sacrifice doing the same thing but only one had the signs following only one had God in their M it doesn't listen listen this message will be preached every but let me tell you Brethren not everywhere the message is preached God is in that come how do you know God is in the camp when the signs and wonders are following hallelujah amen brother come up here you know what is this amen this is a sign and a wonder I changed life you believe that you believe that I wish I was allowed I tell you about the young man and his secs but this is a changed life is a is a Wonder to the devil it's not the only one they are more their lives should change not only that Miracles should happen Tong should healing must happen jobs must be received where's the brother that did not have a job here I don't know is he now at work he came up here and gave a testimony he said oh I didn't have a job iay God give me a job that's what we believe God must manifest himself Amen in signs and wonders in miracles power the moving of the Holy Ghost when you see the message and you see the manifestation of the Holy Ghost then God is in that c hallelujah amen but the camp of balam they they had everything right they had form but they want get you anywhere can't take the place of the Spirit manifestation doctr only does not help us let me emphasize that you've seen people I don't want to talk about I'm not picking on people really there be some that would just say the mystery of this The Mystery of the Myster listen the message is not only the revelation of the mystery the message is to the manifestation of the life of God that is what happened at they put over's Doctrine not the doctr of God and they stumbled and they fell they became dead men and the sacrifice was made balam was ready to prophesy now he has come everything is ready you have those people prophesy Papa was to prophesy but God tied his Tong and he could not Cur them he blessed them hallelujah hallelujah glory to God just give me 10 was very angry but there was nothing that balam could do the prophecy it had been spoken by the Holy Ghost so told bam to go down below into the valley and look upon their back parts to see if there wasn't Vis possibly some way he could cast them he said turn around I'm showing you the of first it was trying to C no matter what just getting the things money and then you go C you see they are paid to preach what they preaching we are not preaching because we are pain we are preaching because we are cold are you hearing me and so now after that one failed he said okay now now and by the way when it comes to paying even our musicians are not paid even our interpreters even our ministers and deons no one is paid oh you're sorry for us if you're sorry for us then you should give your tithe because out of that we shall support the ministry but usually in a small Church like this you can hardly do anything so who then supports the minist God who sent the ministers so friends we don't believe even we don't believe our younger people going there in churches to go and pay so they can pay them that is a spirit of they hirings and you find a brother pring for them the AL is on that doesn't even believe the message there women throwing and you the brother yes brother pet aist he also there a believe of the message and he has to do it so well we don't believe that we believe you should take your gift and use it for the glory of God not for money or gain amen even if it is you people who go there and begin speaking on M and they call you come and speak for me on my wedding the person calling you he has makeup like and you are there and because you are the one speaking on of her you have also to make sure you speak very good about her and then you begin oh look at her she looks so beautiful and you believe of the message you you have a lying time the spirit of B has possessed you see this is what it happens and they they they begin to play their music and they put what music do they play come on some of you have gone party and they play worldly music and comfortable brother you need deliverer no you can't be comfortable you walk away Pastor what are you saying all I'm saying is we are a royal PRI we are a holy nation we are not supposed to mingle with them we are supposed to be different oh I wish I had time when you go down there he speaks about but that's what finish with so you see that spirit is real come in the church you find brother is there called MC master of ceremony Master ceremony and yeah DJ and then they put a song I don't have any word song in my somebody help me with one they put that song and if you're the MC you have toce you can clearly see Prophet balam right in the picture let me tell you brethren we have even brothers who are professional MCS and for them they hired to go and do it for the unbelievers those are Prophet bams we are supposed to be very different if we have a gift it is for the glory of God Pastor what about us are you saying we should not work in companies organizations that are worldly well of course that means we should leave the world go and work brother don't go go and work sister but don't compromise your standards they throw a p they beer they're drinking tell them I'm sorry I'm busy I have an appointment with my God in the church you find a brother not coming to church because on Sunday they have a place of work and they drinking alcohol they smoking they dancing they and for him is having his Coke believer but you in the wrong place at a wrong time you find them organizing trips hey there is a company regulation they organizing trips they going for a safari somewhere and they always ensure that everybody goes in a pair are not married people but they are going to have a good time oning all they dressing all the SK and my brother says me my brother I will go but I will not be in a couple that is the first time and then you will see everything the music moving around playful you I'm really missing out I'm really missing out on the next trip he will come Pastor for me again we are going for that trip a trip for Safari pray for me because things there are not easy I I need to stay in the spirit let me I will not pray for you because it's like bam seeking God for a blessing what is going to do you know it is wrong you are convicted is wrong but you still insist the spirit ofam has already over wanting things and money and and and life and there is no life without Christ today today I've promised you 10 minutes 20 minutes and I've gone overboard but please have mercy have mercy on me tonight I'm I'm about to finish today I've been a typical African you never know when he will finish every minut he say I'm about to but will he be patient with me for just a few moments praise the name of the Lord friends these are the things burning up the generation the spirit of balam is very [Music] tacal he knows how to destroy so now this time you know balak advised balam he said let us change the tactic don't go to cast them when facing with them go behind and see their behind [Music] Parts maybe you might find an an opportunity to they back aparts and the prophet says here the tactics that used at the same TX they use today the big denominations look down at the little groups and anything they find among them make out a scand anything they find out among them to make out a scand they bring it out and shout it if the moderns live in sin no one says anything about it but let one of the El get in trouble you will see the speed of B ring every peer blast across the Israel had a back but says the back parts are the parts you know whereby it says they had their side that wasn't praiseworthy but in spite of their imperfection by the purpose of God that works through election by grace and not by words they had their Cloud by day and P of Fire by night they had the smitten Rock The Serpent and they had signs and wonders they were Vindicated not in themselves but in godu and we see the same thing many times the spirit of bam begins to come and creep into the church how do you know it it will always before even the deons and the pastors andbody it will be able to find out people who are living wrong kind of life you find someone possessed with so TT every saying Believers everywh telling you what is it haven't we seen those Spirits we have seen them they know how to find the back of where they not praiseworthy let me tell you none of us is perfect from preacher to lady from the youngest we are all saved by grace none is perfect in himself but there's one thing that lifts up a believer when you fall you don't remain you rise upu but the devil will always what you did go back even years ago and begin picking things but who is that one telling us this this is the same person who they were saying was no don't tell me anything it's a spirit of balance to try to discredit and now they bring something which you know you did and you begin to feel heavy for sure what was the purpose did not want them to go through wanted them to be discouraged either die or they go back so this was to break them the devil will bring these things to break let me tell if you have done something wrong in your past and you have confessed it and you have repented it God no longer remember don't allow the devil to weaken you because of your parts that are not praised never allow it a spe it to weaken and then you feel like for sure I'm not even worthy what can I even do for god brother come maybe call the other brother you're now quiet because you are all having those parts but if God was to take a person and said this is the only one going to serve doesn't have the back none of us would serve we are all serving by grace and even with that he failed now I'm going to skip everything and go to the part I told you now in spite of the fact that bam knew the proper approach to God and could bring forth a revelation from the Lord by means of a special endur endur of power he was still for all of that a bishop in the first group for what he did do now in order to win favor with bar he now he for now this is the pl I want to finish he formulated a plan tell your neighbor he formul now in this plan wherein God would be forced to deal with Israel in death you can interpr the Satan knew that he could beg beg Eve her to fall in fleshly sin th causing God to pass his pronounced sentence of death against soam knew that if we could get Israel to God would have to deal with them so he planned a way to get them to come over and join in sin he now sent out [Music] invitations invitations to come to the Fe of come over and worship with us come in our church come and pray for us we give you money come and visit us also and then you just go among them but also not only that something that is happening have a a worldy friend and he says come just go to the Disco is only once and then you are very naive sister don't drink no problem it is only a small party a house part but you know all of them are unbeliever I tell you don't worry everything will be fine and then you just go it's all right sister you go part of nonbelievers you are finished brother you finished because you have believed the doctrine ofam when he saw he couldn't cast them he he couldn't find any back parts or whatever said all right I'm going to make them fall in sin and the sin they will fall in is the sin of fornication and how they will do it I will send out invitation so you find brother saying it is all right is just a small part of my friend and then you go there and they went there the younger people they began only for once I don't believe it in my heart but even the songs they not they playing they're not very bad like that not really bad it is like Jerusalem begin and then begin dancing dance they dance they dance and as they were dancing SS brothers from from the church they went over to the part of B worship of and they began dancing and before they could know it I'll read this portion for you as I finish but when those sexy motish women began to dance while they W around this is in the message I'm quoting William he was a man vated by and explaining to us what happened they unest those little sisters of the world they began whing around doing their Rock and rolls and twist The Last Rose [Applause] up the Israelites and they were drawn into adulter from that moment began dancing I've got them this time I've got them was like money has come money has come I can literally smell money what are they [Music] done they were all happy you do not know how demons are happy when you fall into a imal he cannot manage any of the elect has no access until they engage into imal there the demons planted remember they stand and how far is it have they gone in oh yeah he's going that's wa they begin singing songs in are you hearing young people they begin singing in which soon and very soon we are going to have the he is about to fall soon and when lufer joins Theo his sound is the best remember he was the best in heaven they all happy because the believer is going to a worldly part because the believer is going to church I believer what are you going to do there after all is just beautiful when I the man preaches his you go you go we don't have our portion [Music] there when you go among them before you know it you are going to come out with Spirits willor tell what you talking about because the girls that are there the boys that are there are not Sanctified they don't believe what you believe their gospel is different their inspiration is different you go among them you going to begin behaving like and you find those young people in the message the problem with our message preachers complicating Grace they don't understand what does it mean you have to dress something very long for you to be a believer because they went among and they saw someone but when he comes back in his church I hope it's not one of those dead message churches no life but my sisters in the church always dry but when I go there they are spiritual and then he begins making a walk they begin on these groups of does it mean if you a Believer you should wear a skirt which is reaching down no you can be spiritual sister even when you have a Min they have a speed of it has already begun and before you know it these same same people they are living in immorality why because the spirit of has eaten to a Believer you should never have a debate how long should your SC there should never be a why because the Holy Ghost will teach you hallelujah amen the Holy Ghost will tell you you don't need to undress you don't need to show your nakedness you need to cover yourself up why are you opening your body why to entice young men cause them to S have a spirit of you I'm not angry I don't know what is happening also but I I believe God loves all God loves you and that's why he's giving you the truth friends in finishing here I'm done I'm done we find out that these people they Sinn the younger men they went and shared beds of adultery of immorality with the women of Mor and they came out [Music] Brothers God bless you but when you look at them you don't see the glory I mean but how are you I'm fine but they know where they were let me tell you friend there was one young man when that was going on he had a Javin in his hand he was so filled with the Ang of the Holy Ghost when he went in one of the rooms and he saw this brother and this little Moab them and went through the other and he came out feeling a bit do you know how many people God killed that day 23000 all they wanted was to go through Mo refused and when he refused he hired balam to cast them but he couldn't cast them but the only way he could defeat them was the plan he devised to cause them to for now friends this is where we are again the spirit of bam is alive many message Believers are still holding true in the belief of the truth but their life does not measure up they're living in ad they're living in and you cannot live in ofation and you do not do it spiritually you cannot be a genuine belever what is physical will also be your reflection of the you cannot grow spirit and that will bring the wrath of God upon you and that's the of and the Bible says God hates it do you hate it and I pray that if there be anyone of you who has been captured by the the musicians can the spirit of bam I pray that while you we go to prayer now you'll be able to put your life right there are many many more things I would have said but because of time I can't continue let us stand on our feet the spirit of balam the spirit which will go into false Doctrine you will lay a stumbling block before the children of Israel give yourself to commit fornication this spirit and that's why we read in First Corinthians where he said neither be idolators and don't last after evil things the people that sat down to eat and drink rose up to play we saw them what happened in numbers neither let us commit for as some of them committed and fell in may God have mercy but if you're living that kind of life that's the only way the enemy but if you live right the enemy has no power over you Hallelujah that's something that we could talk more but let's just uh go in a little worship if you want to pray you can just come at the altar Pray by yourself and ask God his grace upon your life amen let us sing Holiness [Music] Holiness maybe the sisters if they can have microphones to sing along with me Hallelujah I would like you to sing this song from

I waited on you and this was your mind and gave it over to the people for whoever has been ordained to hear this and they've heard I pray that you will work on their lives and that you will let this word be aligned or they will be aligned according to your word that when your coming be that we shall all be found Gess we shall be found worthy of your coming keep us away from the spirit of balam keep us away from the doctrine of balam the doct of the ncol Lon that we will be pure before you that we will be acceptable that we will be the church spotless Church Without spot or wrinkle washed in the blood of the Lamb ready for your coming father we give you the praise honor and Glory as I commit the people now into your hands as they go to start over this week give them a prosperous week father and overcome for them in whatever scenario that they might be in that they might be able to serve you in spirit and in truth in Jesus name I pray amen [Applause] the Lord bless you so [Music] much uh [Music] we we' come close to the close of our service [Music] tonight but before we [Music] go before we go uh I just wanted to let you know that our carpet here is old need to let you know you already know and a few people have come and told us the carpet is on so it's compromising our quality I believe even before we go to our place I'm a person who believes in excellence I believe in the best or nothing so and that's I believe what children of God have to be we should not settle for less how many agree with me and so we either need to replace the carpet which will cost us about 1 million shs or we do something else as an option um so I spoke with together with one of the deacons I spoke to uh the owner of the hotel and we told him uh we we pay him rent [Music] but we are not satisfied we were talking about the washrooms and then the the the tiing inside here so we came to a conclusion on both issues um for the washrooms I think we Brother Martin will give us the report uh but for the for the inside here we agreed um that he would do he want he wanted to put something it's not t what is it called yes so and he said now the money you have given me I already had other programs you know we had just paid him how much brother [Music] Jo 4.8 million being for rent for how many months six months yes so now we needed to so he said okay I can put Tero if you pay me extra three months it's not for it's for your rent if you pay it to me then I will right away get the person and we begin on the so we we have two options we we pay for rent for extra three months that is 800 * 3 how much is that 2.4 or we buy the the caret of about 1 million how many say we should buy the caret how many say I only had one person how many say we should pay the three months extra rent and we they put ter here yeah if you're a member of the church lift up your hand up how many say okay thank you how many say we should do none of the above okay so I think even the one who had raised up their hand for carpet finally put it down so we are unanimously accepting rent of three extra months um that means we have two options now we we contribute the money now now now through ples or we still reduce on our land uh after all rent whether we we pay it now or later it is still rent expens we are going to make the other one we took it from the land fund I believe people should be able to pledge it and say me I'm going to give 300 I have some Savings of 500 give I have 1 million I'll give it and then we finish it we can do that so how many are ready to pledge some significant amount am of course if you want to be blessed big you have to have a big big b to carry it yes so if if God has trusted you with little they have served him well with it it means you have a heart for a bigger bless so I want those who are going to generously give so that we can raise the 2.4 million without digging on the land fund again actually brother brother Baka say that uh we we we had um we would have been around 6 we would have been more because we also when we were coming here we spent almost 10 million you remember have been going to close to but rent is eating up on us is not good so God should take us out of R and give us our own land the owner of the hotel told told us recently that he received news we have already purchased our land I told Brother Martin don't tell him no just say Amen because usually when God is about to bless you your enemy knows before you so if he said that he had already bought Church land it means it has already been hard in another already know we have read about it before we can even be able to purchase let us look at the Unseen those who are giving I encourage you to continue I'm heing groups who were gathering 200 300 150 I had given I don't think there is some significant change in your incomes in any case I believe your income is becoming no it is becoming better is it becoming better is it the same as last year yes so friends what I'm saying we should increase our giv not reduce it giving shows that we are pursuing the vision my precious brother put your friend in your group if you have friends invite them one of us called one of his brothers he gave one million let us give some where are the group team leaders we have friends that love us and they come to fellowship with us if you see some new talk to them don't force them but encourage them I believe most of our team leaders are good sales people they're doing a good job so with those words I'd like um to have hands up brother Andrew if you could get a pen and paper we col some substantial offerings you say I want to give this I want to give that they write you down and then you give us we need 2.4 million shs I think this is yours so are we moving around just raise up your hand the brother will come to you some of you are going to pledge by faith you'll get the money but you're going to give it there Breen who pledge and don't give we rather get one plge that will pay I don't want to Pastor people with cures we need people who promise God and fulfill their pledges the money we are pledging the the remaining will be got from the church land so those who don't want us to cut from the other side you can pledge up we were supposed even to have a meeting a financial meeting to show you the uh how your money that you're giving in offerings and other giving how it is being used but we did not last last year we did not so we should have it I think not so long after this I think there's another brother there we shall spend and then we will paid back yeah so you can just still pledge but at least within maximum a month yeah I think I'll let brother ranga give his announcements amen after we we do the pledges brother Baka will announce to us how much we have pledged and the remainder we shall pay it from the other side amen God bless bless you church God bless you church are you happy in the Lord yes we want to thank God for the word and uh
