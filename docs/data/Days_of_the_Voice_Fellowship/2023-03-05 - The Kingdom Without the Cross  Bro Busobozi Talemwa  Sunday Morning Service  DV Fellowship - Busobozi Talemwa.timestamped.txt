[6:31] the house of the Lord
[6:33] nice to see every one of you
[6:38] amen Amina we are going to open in the
[6:42] Book of Matthew chapter 16. together
[6:49] and while we open I have a few
[6:50] announcements for you
[6:55] I have an invitation letter here from
[6:57] restaurant Faith Tabernacles
[7:02] it says
[7:04] Freeman Joseph and Pastor biyanima
[7:06] Stephen
[7:10] invite you and you are charged to a
[7:13] three-day meeting that will start on
[7:15] 17th March up to 19th March
[7:31] the Lord has made it possible for Pastor
[7:33] Paul Baird from USA to come and be with
[7:36] us during this time
[7:41] I believe it will be a blessing and time
[7:43] of Awakening for the Bride of Jesus
[7:45] Christ
[7:59] we know all these pastors
[8:08] he had actually invited me to go and
[8:11] minister in his meetings but uh during
[8:14] that time we also had meetings here yeah
[8:20] is also not so far from us
[8:24] they have done um they are co-hosting I
[8:29] think Minister from the U.S and they
[8:31] would like us to go and participate in
[8:32] those meetings
[8:36] so this is
[8:38] and then down here they say days of the
[8:40] voice Fellowship so everybody's invited
[8:46] ever will be able to make it to those
[8:48] meetings
[8:51] that would be wonderful we shall
[8:54] maintain our Sunday service that day
[8:58] but I think there are other two days
[9:00] where you can be able to go and
[9:02] participate
[9:05] that is the weekend after next weekend
[9:07] weekend
[9:09] 17th to 19th if you want to write it
[9:15] and then uh next Sunday that is a Sunday
[9:19] our Sunday service Sunday Jam Services
[9:23] the Lord willing we shall have a friend
[9:25] Pastor Jesse Buddha to come and minister
[9:27] to us
[9:31] well I think it's from gayaza that's
[9:33] where their Fellowship is
[9:35] we're looking forward to another
[9:37] wonderful time
[9:40] I told you but suggested that I've had
[9:42] you interpret and it was wonderful I'm
[9:44] sure preaching will be something else
[9:55] amen and sister peace a pillow told me
[9:58] that she is in leader and should be
[10:00] there for a while
[10:05] and so she asked she said she's with us
[10:08] she streams most of the services and she
[10:10] asks for our prayers
[10:16] so with those announcements we can now
[10:18] go to the reading of the word
[10:24] uh Matthew chapter 16 Mateo is
[10:29] really most of the services my desire is
[10:33] to minister for one hour
[10:39] maybe because of the interpretation it
[10:40] can stretch up a little bit a few
[10:42] minutes after that
[10:46] so I usually request that you give me
[10:50] your undivided attention
[10:53] foreign
[10:55] not actually to me but to the word
[10:58] and I believe that the Lord will
[11:00] minister to your heart
[11:04] how men have come here expectant this
[11:06] morning
[11:09] amen I'm also expectant that the Lord
[11:11] will speak to you
[11:14] the musicians God bless you baby come
[11:18] and appreciate our musicians
[11:21] amen God bless you
[11:24] are most of them are learning but
[11:27] they're trying their best
[11:31] so we read now Matthew chapter 16 verses
[11:35] 24 to 26.
[11:42] and I'm reading in the name of the Lord
[11:46] then said
[11:48] then say Jesus unto his disciples If any
[11:52] man will come after me let him deny
[11:55] himself and take up his cross and follow
[11:58] me
[12:01] [Music]
[12:05] foreign
[12:16] will
[12:18] lose his life
[12:20] for my sake shall find it
[12:31] for what is a man for what is a man
[12:35] propheted if he shall gain the whole
[12:37] world and lose his own soul or what
[12:41] shall a man give in exchange for his
[12:44] soul
[12:54] [Music]
[12:57] amen Lord Jesus I'm going to speak to
[13:01] these people for a few minutes
[13:06] during this time I'm asking that you'll
[13:08] come and take me out of the way
[13:12] Lord I I have my abilities and I also
[13:16] have my insufficiencies
[13:20] can't help your people
[13:23] just ask that you'll come and use me
[13:25] this morning
[13:27] my dear brother Henry also because
[13:30] and father Lord may you help them also
[13:33] to yield themselves
[13:39] to find a place in their souls
[13:43] that only what you need for them to hear
[13:46] this morning will be spoken
[13:49] that's my desire this morning
[13:52] in Jesus name
[13:54] amen amen
[13:59] so
[14:01] this morning I I'd like once again to
[14:04] welcome you to church
[14:07] David said that I was happy when they
[14:10] said unto me let us go to the house of
[14:13] the Lord
[14:17] how many like David this morning
[14:19] are you happy to be in the house amen
[14:24] I am happy to be in the house
[14:39] well if you want me to preach to you
[14:41] this morning you have to respond
[14:44] then I will quickly go to the world and
[14:47] we will quickly hear from the Holy
[14:49] Spirit and and then we'll be out of here
[14:52] today
[14:55] this morning I'd like to speak on the
[14:57] kingdom without the cross
[15:02] once again the kingdom without the cross
[15:07] tell your neighbor the kingdom without
[15:10] the cross
[15:15] this is what we want to speak on this
[15:17] morning
[15:18] so now Jesus came to his disciples and
[15:21] said to them yes
[15:28] let him deny himself
[15:35] and follow me now in the commentary by
[15:39] Benson or Benson commentary mobile
[15:45] it's a Bible commentary
[15:47] commentary a YouTuber Benson you know he
[15:51] says if any man be willing to your moon
[15:55] so you know he says that if any man be
[15:59] willing
[16:00] meaning no one is forced
[16:04] it's just like a young man that wants to
[16:07] marry a young lady
[16:11] you cannot force marriage
[16:13] if you want to marry somebody you can
[16:16] force them tomorrow
[16:19] there has to be a willingness
[16:23] says that you see the young lady also
[16:26] makes her choice
[16:29] and decides to take on this young man
[16:33] and as a husband
[16:36] because it's only one decision that you
[16:38] make
[16:40] so in the same way
[16:43] Jesus said If any man will come after me
[16:46] yes
[17:09] it must be on the following terms
[17:14] it must be on the following times
[17:21] and I wanted to hear those times I'm
[17:23] going to list those terms for you
[17:25] so Jesus here in the Book of Matthew
[17:29] he lists for us times
[17:33] [Music]
[17:34] upon which if we want to follow him
[17:38] [Music]
[17:40] that we must adhere to journey
[17:45] following Jesus has times
[17:50] the repercussions to it
[17:53] and you don't just follow him
[17:57] if anybody could just follow Jesus
[18:02] Jesus would have been the greatest
[18:04] followed man on Earth today
[18:07] yes
[18:10] but there are many people who want to
[18:12] follow Jesus
[18:15] not so many people
[18:22] foreign
[19:11] [Music]
[19:20] [Music]
[19:28] are you hearing me this morning let him
[19:31] deny
[19:33] ing hurt him however we however pleasing
[19:37] it is
[19:42] and then you do the will of God the
[19:45] woman
[19:50] then you have to deny your will and do
[19:54] the will of God
[19:58] Amen Amina
[20:01] and then that brings the second the the
[20:04] second condition or the second term
[20:09] when he says and then the second one is
[20:12] you take up your cross
[20:21] praise the name of the Lord
[20:26] taking up your cross and carrying your
[20:28] cross
[20:30] is not easy
[20:33] jesus carried the cross yesterday but
[20:36] this cross was pointing to Calvary
[20:40] he was pointing to death because
[20:48] you know pointing to self-deniality
[20:52] but Jesus was willing to carry his cross
[20:55] foreign
[21:26] really carrying the cross and going
[21:28] through the pain Agony and suffering
[21:32] here on the dying yourself
[21:37] he's speaking on dying yourself
[21:40] in the message the water of Separation
[21:44] he says
[21:58] whether it is
[22:06] all other grounds is sinking Sun almost
[22:18] says it's an individual Affairs
[22:23] when you come to Jesus Christ
[22:26] if you want to be a follower of Jesus
[22:29] you must be willing to say on Christ
[22:33] alone I stand
[22:37] don't care when I lose this if I open I
[22:40] don't care whether I lose them I don't
[22:42] care whether I lose that I am willing
[22:45] and ready to carry my clothes
[22:47] and follow Jesus
[22:51] he says it's an individual Affair
[22:55] not of groups of people
[22:58] but it is
[23:07] a soul human being
[23:10] might notice might forsake your own
[23:13] thoughts
[23:16] in in witnessing this message to many
[23:19] people over the years
[23:22] I've often found that people find it
[23:25] easy to believe if others believe
[23:32] but when their friends are not believing
[23:34] the message
[23:36] it becomes very hard for them to believe
[23:39] it
[23:40] because they want that bandwagon effect
[23:45] and others believe because others
[23:57] I said let me open
[23:59] up if we can so we went to another one
[24:01] that we were not here because you're
[24:03] following somebody
[24:04] you are here because you are following
[24:07] Jesus Christ
[24:21] not you and some other people
[24:24] as long as you have your own thoughts
[24:28] as long as you have your own thoughts
[24:32] of you your own ways
[24:36] your ways
[24:38] a contrary to God this ways
[24:43] tell your neighbor you're always a
[24:45] country
[24:48] um
[24:54] foreign
[25:05] [Applause]
[25:15] for you've got to die at your own
[25:17] thoughts
[25:19] of you he says do you know that
[25:22] your thoughts as long as you look at it
[25:26] as long as you look at it materially in
[25:29] order
[25:30] yourself well that can't happen no game
[25:33] that's not reasonable
[25:37] think of such a thing as long as you do
[25:41] that
[25:42] then you will stay in your condition
[25:47] hello amen God wants you to change your
[25:50] condition
[25:52] God wants to change
[25:54] God wants to bless you God wants to give
[25:58] you the desires
[26:00] as long as you stay with your own Souls
[26:04] of you amen you think of it materially
[26:07] you see it is
[26:12] as long as you stay like that
[26:47] he says you get to a place
[26:50] where you cannot think your ways
[26:55] but come into Christ
[26:58] I think his way of thinking
[27:04] the things begin to shift different away
[27:07] means
[27:10] amen the things will begin
[27:14] at the moment you take God at his wife
[27:18] things will begin to shape different
[27:21] do you want to see a change
[27:36] if you want to follow Jesus
[27:44] you must be willing to drop your ideas
[27:58] foreign
[28:20] Jesus
[28:57] in Romans chapter 6 verse 6
[29:01] knowing this
[29:05] is crucified with him yeah
[29:10] hallelujah hallelujah
[29:22] they are crucified with Christ they are
[29:25] committed
[29:27] look here man
[29:30] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[29:34] [Music]
[29:36] we should not serve sin
[29:40] for he that is dead
[29:42] is freedom from sin
[29:49] walking on
[29:51] um
[29:55] it cannot succeed
[29:57] [Music]
[29:58] because
[30:00] we are dead to sini
[30:04] and he that is dead

[30:10] the scripture up here he that is dead oh

[30:17] freed from sin

[30:30] that we shall also live
[30:38] is that a man
[30:40] with him
[30:43] we shall live with him
[30:47] Christ died to his desires Must Die to
[30:51] his thoughts die to his ideas
[31:23] the way Jesus was crucified
[31:27] when I am sure I am going to have a new
[31:31] life
[31:32] Jesus rose again
[31:38] with a new purpose

[49:24] this Kingdom to him
[49:33] foreign
[49:46] [Music]
[49:57] but you remember
[49:59] he was trying to Forfeit them to him
[50:01] without the cross
[50:04] if he did we would be lost
[50:12] but he must come back
[50:14] so you see he was tempted to do it
[50:19] death is a hard thing
[50:22] none of us here want to die
[50:25] if they told you that you're going to
[50:26] die the next minute
[50:28] you would give up everything to live oh
[50:31] yes
[50:33] [Music]
[50:35] they told the king you're going to die
[50:37] immediately
[50:40] thank God give me more time
[50:43] death is a bad thing
[50:46] it's a hard thing
[50:48] he was tempted to take his Liberty
[50:53] and be the king of the earth
[50:55] without the cross
[51:01] subjects would have died
[51:04] Saturn would have gladly made that
[51:06] proposition with him
[51:09] [Applause]
[51:15] he did not do it
[51:17] he come and suffered
[51:20] and he took the hard rocket route Glory
[52:33] at the end of the time foreign
[52:44] let me hope that we are not thinking
[52:46] that following Jesus Christ is the bed
[52:48] of roses
[52:48] [Applause]
[52:52] are we this morning willing to do it
[52:56] to take that same rule that he taken
[52:59] that's the question are we willing
[53:03] to die
[53:05] are we willing to give ourselves up to
[53:08] God
[53:09] are we willing to fulfill the world and
[53:11] the things to serve him for questions
[53:16] [Music]
[53:18] I'll give you one more example
[53:21] in the book of First Samuel chapter 24
[53:23] summary
[53:25] from verses
[53:31] and it came to pass I'll read in English
[53:33] and then if you want to lugan you can
[53:35] follow your Bible and it came to pass
[53:37] when Saul was returned from following
[53:39] the Philistines that it was told him
[53:42] saying behold David is in the wilderness
[53:44] of engadine then Saul took three
[53:47] thousand chosen men out of all Israel
[53:49] and went to seek David
[53:51] and his men upon the rocks of the wild
[53:54] goats
[53:56] and he came to the ship courts by the
[53:59] way where was a cave and Saul went in to
[54:02] cover his feet
[54:05] and David and his men remained in the
[54:08] sides of the cave and the men of David
[54:10] said unto him
[54:12] behold the day of of which the Lord has
[54:16] said unto thee behold I will deliver
[54:18] thine enemy into thy hand that thou
[54:21] mayest do to him as it shall seem good
[54:23] unto thee
[54:24] then David arose and cut off the skirt
[54:27] of souls robe privily and it came to
[54:30] pass afterward that David's heart smote
[54:32] him because he had cut off swords cut
[54:34] and he said unto his men the Lord forbid
[54:37] that I should do this thing unto my
[54:39] master the Lord is Anointed to stretch
[54:42] forth my heart against him saying he is
[54:45] the anointed of the Lord
[54:46] so David stayed his servants with these
[54:49] words and suffered them not to Rise
[54:50] Against soul but Soul rose up out of the
[54:54] cave and went out his way
[54:56] now I want you to see that in here
[54:59] [Applause]
[55:00] [Music]
[55:02] David
[55:04] was anointed to be the next king
[55:10] are you following me
[55:12] he was anointed to be the next king yes
[55:18] and God had rejected soul
[55:21] but remember previously Saul was also an
[55:24] anointed king is
[55:31] Saul was hunting David
[55:34] to kill him
[55:37] but David knew
[55:39] the throne was his
[55:43] and one day as they went into those
[55:47] Mountain areas of energy
[55:52] and soul decided to go by the cave
[55:57] but he did not know
[55:59] that actually David was in the same
[56:01] caves
[56:07] was called unawares
[56:13] and
[56:14] David took out you know one one of the
[56:17] boys told him
[56:19] here my monster
[56:21] God has delivered your enemies into your
[56:24] heart
[56:27] and David took out a sword now the
[56:30] United champion and cut off a piece of
[56:32] the clothes
[56:41] yes the kingdom is mine
[56:44] but this is not how I should get it
[56:49] that was the wrong path
[56:51] I shouldn't take another man is
[56:57] [Applause]
[56:58] touch not my anointed
[57:02] my prophets
[57:08] the anointed of the Lord
[57:11] even if God had rejected him
[57:13] he still was the anointed of the Lord
[57:21] take him off of it the same God that
[57:25] told David he will get there
[57:29] without David doing anything about it
[57:32] all that you desire in your life God can
[57:36] bring you to eat
[57:38] without you doing anything about it
[57:49] right he was tempted the audio came here
[57:51] many times we are tempted and we didn't
[57:54] mean you took a member you see for
[57:55] example for you young people
[57:57] you're going to get a wife but it never
[58:00] tempts you stand your camera and gives
[58:02] you something less
[58:04] tries to kill your life
[58:11] [Applause]
[58:15] because he knows the things that God has
[58:18] prepared for you
[58:20] so he will want to bring you down
[58:26] you get a kingdom without the cross
[58:30] but God is looking for a people
[58:33] are willing to set their heart
[58:57] [Applause]
[59:06] and so he repented himself
[59:09] because that was a temptation
[59:12] but David
[59:15] did not come through with it
[59:19] he did not come he did not sin he did
[59:22] not come through with it he did not kill
[59:23] Saul
[59:26] you see as a child of God you might be
[59:28] tempted many times
[59:31] to get the kingdom
[59:34] without the cross Brothers
[1:00:15] while there are uh
[1:00:28] then again you remember like David
[1:00:38] let's continue further along
[1:00:43] we will understand
[1:00:48] cheer up my brother
[1:00:52] live in the sand come on
[1:00:58] we will understand it my brother my
[1:01:00] sister together
[1:01:06] why they live the better life it seemed
[1:01:09] watch
[1:01:11] a lot down life
[1:01:14] seem to be happier
[1:01:19] seem to have everything
[1:01:22] to have nothing
[1:01:35] amen
[1:02:06] all other roads are West
[1:02:08] um
[1:02:11] David decided to take that road
[1:02:20] don't take his life
[1:02:23] he is the anointed of the Lord
[1:02:26] in other words don't kill the man that
[1:02:30] is not my way of receiving and taking up
[1:02:33] the kingdom
[1:02:36] leave him and they left him
[1:02:40] and you know one time they were in
[1:02:43] battle
[1:02:44] somebody shot an arrow
[1:02:48] Hallelujah
[1:03:17] David instead of being excited down in
[1:03:20] Virginia Brethren don't be easily
[1:03:22] excitable
[1:03:25] see with things that people bring to you
[1:03:27] maybe in trouble what the world offers
[1:03:32] the offers of the world they did not
[1:03:35] excite you an interest
[1:03:37] David was so
[1:03:40] uh
[1:03:41] full of characters
[1:03:43] and he could not take that crown
[1:03:47] on the basis of rejoicing upon the death
[1:03:50] of God
[1:03:52] he told him don't you know he's a man of
[1:03:56] God and anointed
[1:04:00] and he killed him
[1:04:03] right there and then he took his crown
