[1:48:20] on friday 8 30
[1:48:22] and also i wanted to let you know

[1:48:28] brother
[1:48:30] brother
[1:48:33] [Music]
[1:48:37] and we have reached an agreement
[1:48:40] and we actually made the payment to him
[1:48:45] [Applause]
[1:48:49] we
[1:48:50] made the payment to him for
[1:48:52] for six months up front as we agreed
[1:48:59] and uh that would be
[1:49:01] although we
[1:49:04] i know he had asked for five hundred
[1:49:05] thousand a month so
[1:49:07] we're not able to reach that milestone
[1:49:09] here we collected
[1:49:10] for
[1:49:11] uh four hundred thousand but at least we
[1:49:15] reached a compromise
[1:49:16] he was able to accept 450 a month so
[1:49:20] that's what we paid for
[1:49:21] [Music]
[1:49:23] so that gives us a
[1:49:25] 300 000 more that we need from what we
[1:49:27] collected but also the brothers here
[1:49:30] not do good math
[1:49:32] there is some more money which we'll let
[1:49:34] you know on sunday which was not
[1:49:35] uh which was missing and what your
[1:49:37] brother has added up so either you will
[1:49:39] tell the brothers to pay it up or you
[1:49:40] will help them and
[1:49:44] we will be able to figure that out so
[1:49:46] please all those who did the pledges
[1:49:48] make sure
[1:49:49] you fulfill your pledges
[1:49:52] according to your commitment
[1:49:55] so uh the first sunday of august
