[3:15] that's what the holy spirit will have
[3:17] for us away
[3:30] now he says now Faith is the substance
[3:33] of things for the evidence of Things Not
[3:35] Seen
[3:48] obtained a good report
[3:54] through faith we understand that the
[3:57] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[3:59] that things which are seen we are not
[4:01] made of things which do
[4:03] appears
[4:05] [Music]
[4:13] so whatever was made was not made out of
[4:16] the things that we see
[4:20] it was made of things which do not
[4:22] appeared
[4:24] by faith offered unto God a more
[4:27] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[4:29] you obtained witness that he was
[4:31] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[4:33] and by it being dead yet speaking
[5:00] of God of things not not seen as yet
[5:05] moved with fear prepared an ark to the
[5:08] saving of his house by the which he
[5:10] condemned the world and became hair of
[5:13] the righteousness which is by faith
[5:17] is
[5:37] notice that all these people were able
[5:40] to please God by faith
[5:51] God warned him of things which had not
[5:54] yet come down
[6:03] to the saving of his heart
[6:24] [Music]
[6:56] by faith Abraham when he was called to
[6:59] go out into a place which he should
[7:00] after receive for an inheritance obeyed
[7:03] and he went out not knowing whether he
[7:06] went
[7:08] away foreign
[7:34] [Music]
[7:53] has foundations whose Builder and Mecca
[7:56] is God through faith also Sarah has
[7:59] self-received strength to conceive sin
[8:02] and was delivered of a child when she
[8:04] was past age because she judged him
[8:07] faithful who had promised there are for
[8:10] sprung sprung there even of one and him
[8:14] as good as dead so many as the stars of
[8:17] the sky in the in the in multitude and
[8:20] as the sand which is by the sea show
[8:22] innumerable these all died in faith not
[8:26] having received the promises but having
[8:28] seen them are far off and were persuaded
[8:31] of them and embraced them and confessed
[8:34] that they were strangers and pilgrims on
[8:37] the earth for they that say such things
[8:39] declare plainly that they seek a country
[8:42] and truly if they had been mindful of
[8:45] that country where from which they came
[8:47] out they might have had opportunity to
[8:50] have returned but now they desire that
[8:53] better country that is our Heavenly
[8:55] Hallelujah wherever God is not ashamed
[8:58] to be called their God for he has
[9:01] prepared for them a city by faith
[9:03] Abraham when he was tried offered up
[9:06] Isaac and he had received the promises
[9:09] um offered up he's only begotten son of
[9:13] whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy
[9:16] seed be called
[9:17] accounting that God was able to raise
[9:20] him up even from the dead from whence
[9:22] also he received him in a figure by
[9:26] faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau
[9:29] concerning things to come by faith Jacob
[9:31] when he was dying uh blessed both the
[9:34] sons of Joseph and worship and Jacob
[9:37] when he was dying blessed both the sons
[9:39] of Joseph and worship leaning upon the
[9:41] tops of his staff by faith Joseph when
[9:44] he died made mention of them at The
[9:47] Parting of the children of Israel and
[9:49] gave commandment concerning his bones
[9:51] Listen by faith Moses when he was born
[9:54] was hit three months of his parents
[9:57] because they saw he was a proper child
[10:00] and they were not afraid of the king's
[10:02] commandment by faith Moses when he was
[10:05] come to yes refused to be called the son
[10:07] of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[10:09] suffer Affliction with the people of God
[10:11] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[10:14] season esteeming the reproach of Christ
[10:16] great and riches and the treasures in
[10:19] Egypt for he had respect unto the
[10:23] recompense of the river
[10:25] are you listening Church
[10:27] by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing
[10:30] the Wrath of the king for he endure that
[10:33] seeing him who is invisible through
[10:35] faith he kept the past over and the
[10:38] sprinkling of blood lest he that
[10:40] destroyed the firstborn should touch
[10:41] them by faith they passed through the
[10:44] Red Sea as by dry land which the
[10:47] Egyptians are saying to do we're drawn
[10:51] by faith the words of Jericho fell down
[10:54] after they were compassed about seven
[10:56] days by faith they had Raha perished not
[10:59] with them that believed not when she had
[11:01] received the spies with peace
[11:03] and what shall I must say for the time
[11:06] would fail me to tell of Gideon and a
[11:08] Barack and of Samson and of Jefferson
[11:11] of David also and Samuel and all the
[11:14] prophets
[11:15] who through faith subdue kingdoms not
[11:19] righteousness obtained promises stop the
[11:22] mouths of lions quite the violence of
[11:24] fire escape the edge of the sword out of
[11:27] weakness
[11:29] we are met strong
[11:31] Works Valiant in fight time to flight
[11:35] the armies of the aliens women received
[11:39] their dead raised to life again and
[11:42] others were tortured not accepting
[11:43] Deliverance they might obtain a better
[11:46] resurrection and others had tried your
[11:49] cruel mockings and scoldings yeah
[11:51] moreover of Bones and imprisonment
[11:54] they were stoned they were sold asunder
[11:57] were attempted were slain with sword
[12:00] they were they wandered about in sheep's
[12:03] skin and got skin being destitute
[12:04] Afflicted tormented
[12:07] of whom the word was not worthy
[12:09] they wanted in deserts and in mountains
[12:12] and in dens and in caves of the earth
[12:14] and these all having obtained a good
[12:17] report through faith received not the
[12:20] promise
[12:21] God having provided some better thing
[12:23] for us that they without us should not
[12:26] be made perfect
[12:29] when you read this Hebrews 11 years
[12:34] see The Chronicles of Faith
[12:38] before who had faith
[12:40] and he even ended by saying that all of
[12:43] them died having not obtained a promise
[12:50] you know somewhere in the Bible it says
[12:53] that I think also is in the book of
[12:54] Hebrews it says that uh
[12:56] if Joshua had given them rest
[13:00] is
[13:05] that now there remaineth thereof arrest
[13:08] for the people of God
[13:12] and now the seventh day Adventists take
[13:15] that scripture to mean that that's
[13:18] rest that was remaining was the Sabbath
[13:21] race
[13:27] because actually in the book in the KJV
[13:29] says for if Jesus had given them rest
[13:34] then he wouldn't have talked of another
[13:36] day
[13:39] but but you see there he was meaning
[13:42] Joshua
[13:44] Joshua did not give these people rest
[13:46] yes
[13:48] when Moses brought them out of Egypt
[13:52] Joshua took them into the promised land
[13:54] yes
[13:55] and they believed on God
[13:59] through us to their souls
[14:03] after fighting for years and years
[14:11] we are going to finally go to our
[14:14] promised land and rest yeah Joshua
[14:51] [Music]
[15:14] by faith they did what they did
[15:18] Faith they never obtained a promise
[15:24] say today under the dispensation of
[15:28] faith in Christ
[15:36] amen we have obtained the true promise
[15:39] of the Holy ghosts
[15:41] of the change of our bodies
[15:45] and these men and women were men and
[15:48] women of Faith
[15:52] surely none of us has reached any of
[15:55] them
[15:57] talk about Moses
[16:13] they never let go they believed God
[16:18] foreign
[16:51] did you realize that Abraham was ready
[16:54] to give his son
[16:58] Abraham believed in the resurrection
[17:02] I believe it even if I give my son God
[17:05] is able to raise him up again
[17:12] had never requested for child sacrifice
[17:18] God had never requested for human
[17:20] sacrifice
[17:23] you read your Bible That's the only
[17:25] sacrifice God has never asked question
[17:27] my Bible yes
[17:36] not for you to die
[17:40] but because Jesus Christ died in your
[17:43] state yes the only human that has ever
[17:47] died
[17:51] we may be able to surrender ourselves
[17:56] not just die because he was a human like
[17:59] any of us
[18:01] died because he was the I am yeah and we
[18:06] are supposed to believe in him
[18:08] our faith must be built on something
[18:14] and today in the service I will take one
[18:17] example here
[18:23] they
[18:24] another in chapter 11 of John
[18:28] and I'd like you to look at it
[18:31] tonight
[18:43] our faith must have a basis
[18:55] notice that it is not I'm not saying he
[18:58] was
[19:04] Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[19:07] today and foreign
[19:43] [Music]
[19:56] [Music]
[20:17] remember when Peter was you know when he
[20:21] when they saw Jesus coming walking
[20:25] oh they realized I am is coming yeah
[20:32] but if you are the one
[20:34] let me also walk on the water like you
[20:37] now
[20:38] Jesus said you can come so I started
[20:42] walking but he was so happy yeah
[20:51] he removed his eyes on Jesus
[20:59] and he put his eyes on his brothers and
[21:02] sisters
[21:11] he started sinking
[22:09] the world will be around you
[22:13] prayers of the world and temptations of
[22:15] the world all Troubles of the world
[22:18] let me tell you what keeps a believer
[22:26] Hallelujah Amina now a certain man was
[22:29] sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town
[22:32] of Mary and her sister Martha
[22:36] um
[22:45] is the brother to marry and mother right
[22:50] you remember this Mary is the same woman
[22:53] that
[22:54] bowed to the feet of Jesus and washed
[22:57] Jesus's feet with your own kids
[23:06] so Jesus has a long connection with his
[23:09] with his family
[23:14] I love it when Jesus is not in
[23:16] connection with only me but with my
[23:19] family
[23:25] amen then he has a more reason to come
[23:28] to your rescue
[23:30] [Music]
[23:32] look at verse 3 says it was that Mary
[23:35] which anointed the Lord with ointment
[23:38] and wiped his feet with her hair whose
[23:42] brother Lazarus was sick
[23:55] remember we talked about this woman
[23:57] sometimes
[24:00] with Jesus Christ
[24:02] but from that experience has never been
[24:06] the same again
[24:13] his sister sent unto him saying
[24:17] Lord
[24:18] behold he whom thou lovest is sick
[24:23] now Jesus was not only friends with Mary
[24:28] and Martha but it was also a friend
[24:31] with Lazarus yes
[24:40] and when they were sending for Jesus
[24:43] listen
[24:45] friends of Jesus
[24:48] we are telling Jesus about his friends
[24:51] okay
[24:57] when you when you pray such a prayer
[25:00] foreign
[25:06] if you are a friend of Jesus
[25:09] telling Jesus
[25:12] about his friends
[25:16] oh Jesus yes your friend a baby
[25:21] is in trouble
[25:24] Jesus is your friend yes
[25:30] you must always show up take a joke
[25:35] Amina
[25:37] so the way they wrote the letter words
[25:49] when Jesus had that he said this
[25:52] sickness is not unto death yes
[25:55] [Applause]
[25:57] for the glory of God
[26:00] might be glorified thereby
[26:04] Jesus love
[26:20] that he was sick he Abode two days still
[26:24] in the same place where he was
[26:29] think about it
[26:41] [Music]
[26:47] he did not go to them
[26:51] he never sent
[26:54] anybody to them
[26:57] because he loved them
[27:03] isn't it amazing
[27:07] what do we believe it today
[27:09] oh that Jesus loved you so much yes but
[27:14] when you were in trouble
[27:20] oh what a love no
[27:25] we are talking about faith
[27:28] and we are talking about
[27:32] Let Me Tell Lazarus

[28:40] feeling like puking then you say okay
[28:46] because I feel the way I've seen
[28:49] that doesn't mean God disapproves of me

[35:14] because we were in him before foreign
[36:00] [Music]
[36:08] trials to come your way
[36:12] in his wisdom he saw that the Destroyer
[36:16] will be good for my daughter

[37:58] this stage
[38:02] I'm joyful from my house
[39:00] no matter what they go through
[39:04] a Believer is not expected at any time
[39:07] so
[39:17] brother what is it
[39:19] be quiet
[39:22] when I'm in this situation I can be
[39:25] dangerous
[39:30] do you understand Omani who you are
[39:34] sorry
[39:35] if only you knew who you were under my
[39:37] literally you would not behave that to a
[39:40] brother the one days
[39:41] that were sisters

[40:57] [Music]
[41:34] foreign foreign
[42:10] how about your day your mother body

[42:24] they wanted to kill you those Jews are
[42:28] not easy

[42:40] go cubanga
[42:42] foreign
[43:14] [Music]
[43:19] which will
[43:21] make the devil thing I didn't understand
[43:24] your clothes Jesus can never come back
[43:26] again
[43:32] so that he's coming
[43:36] will be a great Victory
[43:41] not only for you Amina
[43:47] even our God is wise
[43:50] he doesn't want to do anything which
[43:52] doesn't also give him glory
[43:58] so you want him to give you something
[44:00] quickly
[44:02] how does it benefit
[44:06] you see he allows things to happen
[44:10] for his glory
[44:13] okay so everybody's fearing to go back
[44:18] so Jesus answered yes
[44:28] because he sees the light of this world
[44:32] Jesus was trying to show them something
[44:34] yes
[44:48] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[44:51] and forever yes
[44:53] we need to understand
[44:56] things happened
[45:02] when we come to him we must believe he
[45:05] is
[45:07] we must believe he does not change
[45:13] hallelujah amen but if a man walk in the
[45:17] line in the night
[45:19] is tumbling yes if I walk without Christ
[45:22] you stumble
[45:24] because there is no light in him
[45:29] this thing said he and after that he
[45:32] says unto them I
[45:36] foreign
[45:45] [Music]
[45:58] [Music]
[46:00] he shall do well
[46:04] how about Jesus speak unto he of his
[46:06] death yes
[46:08] but they thought that he had spoken of
[46:11] taking rest inside
[46:15] then said Jesus unto them plainly yes
[46:19] Lazarus is dead
[46:23] you know many times God speaks to us but
[46:25] we don't understand
[46:28] because our mind is so narrowing into
[46:31] others
[46:35] we need to have faith
[46:41] is Revelations
[47:06] ye may believe
[47:08] already
[47:11] say nevertheless let us go unto him
[47:15] all these verses are so rich
[47:21] which is called
[47:24] this is the guy who doubts
[47:27] so some have said his fellow disciples
[47:39] laughs
[47:41] he knew that Jesus was hunted there
[47:46] yeah
[47:48] we knew if we go there we are gone we
[47:51] are finished
[47:55] so let's just go and die together
[48:00] you see sometimes we need to have the
[48:03] faith like that on someone
[48:07] we should be like we should be like that
[48:10] woman Esther
[48:11] they said I'm going before the king yeah
[48:17] hallelujah amen said let's go with him
[48:21] so that you can die with him
[48:25] [Applause]
[48:27] follow Jesus
[48:29] have faith in here
[48:33] everybody should die with him die with
[48:36] him
[48:39] if people call you a fanatic Republic
[48:42] Missouri
[48:44] then when Jesus came and he found that
[48:46] he had laid in the grave four days
[48:49] already yes we have to Karnataka come on
[48:52] now Bethany was night now unto Jerusalem
[48:56] Bethany uh
[48:59] off and many of the Jews came to Martha
[49:02] and married to comfort them concerning
[49:05] their brothers
[49:06] [Music]
[49:10] as soon as she had that Jesus was coming
[49:13] yesterday went and met him
[49:17] at Mary sat still in the house
[49:20] it doesn't matter whether you've run to
[49:23] go meet him or whether you're in the
[49:24] house he is since you don't know what to
[49:26] say
[49:32] this is quite amazing for me
[49:34] it doesn't matter where they were
[49:38] Jesus was yes
[49:41] he did not change
[49:47] praise the Lord
[49:50] praise the Lord
[49:56] let's follow still here now it's a very
[49:59] good story
[50:02] and many of the Jews all right now then
[50:04] said Master unto Jesus
[50:17] not even now
[50:20] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[50:26] if you hadn't been here
[50:29] that is
[50:32] all right it would have been good
[50:37] but now the woman I realize
[50:42] [Music]
[50:45] things will change
[50:49] then my brother was alive
[51:01] the difference
[51:13] things might have changed
[51:15] once he comes in the equation
[51:36] let me let me skip here so I can get to
[51:40] that quote for you
[51:42] and Matt around to find Jesus
[51:45] I'm reading from uh uh from the super
[51:49] sense
[51:52] praise the Lord when must I run to find
[51:55] Jesus
[52:38] Lord I wish you were here
[52:44] situations
[53:23] what people thought could not be changed
[53:30] Jesus put himself together
[53:37] this is the resurrection
[53:58] all right let's go back to our
[53:59] scriptures
[54:03] going to across
[54:06] all right Nina praise the Lord come help
[54:09] us away
[54:10] okay so brother says there is
[54:18] I know even now whatsoever that will ask
[54:20] of God God will give it to me
[54:26] thy Brothers
[54:39] now at that moment I would like to say
[54:41] that Martha actually believes in Jesus
[54:43] but
[54:48] her last words there foreign
[55:06] she lacked Faith she lacked a revelation
[55:08] yes
[55:11] of that moment
[55:21] promises that God has made to us
[55:25] but we always push them in the future
[55:31] we believe them you can believe
[55:34] something and not have faith about it
[55:42] okay let me let me prove that to you
[55:44] Mark chapter 9 verse 23.
[55:48] if thou can't believe all things are
[55:51] possible to him that believe yes
[55:54] and straight away the father of the
[55:57] child Cried Out say it with tears Lord I
[56:00] believe help thou my unbelief
[56:08] okay Lord I believe yeah
[56:17] foreign
[56:45] [Music]
[56:48] right yeah okay
[56:52] but the man says
[56:54] you are able to believe it is believing
[56:57] it is one thing
[57:01] but faith is something else
[57:11] but he realized
[57:17] now the Bible says
[57:21] that you don't need even much Faith
[57:24] some of these things
[57:26] you had Faith Like a seed of a mustard
[57:30] mustard
[57:32] you can tell a mountain to be removed
[57:35] from here
[57:39] so now we believe all these things
[58:03] I believe my brother
[58:08] but she lacked face
[58:12] how can it be possible
[58:20] but in the resurrection
[58:33] it will be but in the resurrection
[58:36] that's how we believe God many times
[58:44] but that's not what God is requiring
[58:48] God requires us to have faith
[58:51] foreign
[59:41] [Music]
[1:00:09] religious
[1:00:18] God expects you to have faith
[1:00:21] God wants to do amen he wants to give
[1:00:25] you that Revelation
[1:00:38] I remember one day I was going to uh I
[1:00:41] was going to go to God God gave me a
[1:00:44] vision
[1:00:46] a place where I was supposed to go I did
[1:00:48] not know the place but uh
[1:01:06] you know supposed to help me guide me to
[1:01:10] go there
[1:01:12] I did not have money enough to go now
[1:01:17] with the vision
[1:01:20] already I knew I had to go
[1:01:24] but now I didn't have money but God help
[1:01:28] me help me Vision built up my face
[1:01:34] I told my wife just helped me get back
[1:01:38] here
[1:01:49] I didn't even ask nobody
[1:02:51] she said
[1:03:03] not yourself
[1:03:15] you know exercise
[1:04:03] when you you become old 90 years
[1:04:12] promise in your life
[1:04:15] foreign
[1:05:15] yeah and said the resurrection
[1:05:19] I am in sexy life
[1:05:23] a life
[1:05:25] not a resurrection
[1:05:28] but I am the resurrection in the morning
[1:05:34] meaning without me there is no
[1:05:38] Resurrection there is
[1:05:41] no life anymore and if he was declaring
[1:05:46] I am the resurrection

[1:07:59] know who their friends are

[1:08:26] your friends to church

[1:11:06] was kissing the feet
[1:11:23] when Jesus saw how weeping yes and the
[1:11:28] Jews also weeping which came with us he
[1:11:31] grown in the spirit

[1:13:10] that's what Jesus wanted
[1:13:15] he wanted to get this man
