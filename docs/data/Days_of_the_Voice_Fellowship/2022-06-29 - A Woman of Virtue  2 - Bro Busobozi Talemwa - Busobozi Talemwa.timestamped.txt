[8:52] honor to him for the marriage of the
[8:54] lamb is calm and his wife has made
[8:56] herself ready

[10:21] sunday praise the lord coming that's the
[10:23] way i'm glad that i'm a woman of virtue
[10:26] and they sent me for command and
[10:27] democracy
[10:28] and uh on sunday everybody was a woman
[10:44] spiritually speaking we are all the
[10:45] bride of jesus
[10:49] christ when the bible says for the
[10:51] marriage
[10:52] of the lamb is come everywhere
[10:56] talking about the marriage of jesus
[10:58] christ
[11:00] christian but you see jesus christ is
[11:02] only the male but there is also a part
[11:04] which is the female
[11:05] yes
[11:10] that female part is you know
[11:14] just like we say and we have believed
[11:16] that jesus is the chief he's the head of
[11:19] the church to come and he took his
[11:21] aunties
[11:23] called jesus the head of the church
[11:25] bible yesterday
[11:30] [Music]
[11:41] is the one who leads and guides us
[11:46] and is the one who marries us
[11:48] and we are the body category just like
[11:52] the wife is subject to the word to the
[11:55] husband
[11:58] the church also must be subject to
[12:00] christ
[12:02] and uh just like in a family like the
[12:05] bible says that the man is the head of
[12:07] the wife
[12:23] the church no longer wants the headship
[12:25] of christ
[12:29] like the scripture also says that you
[12:31] see in the end time that women will want
[12:34] to heap themselves upon a man
[12:49] we don't really want anything from you
[12:51] neither to religion
[12:53] we don't want you to take care of us
[12:55] never want that
[12:56] we have everything we need to attack you
[12:59] we have our own house we have our own
[13:24] [Music]
[14:22] [Applause]
[14:29] to its core
[14:34] you see when you call me protestant
[14:37] it means i'm supposed to be protesting
[14:39] the wrong teachings
[14:40] and you know
[14:42] but they instead do not protest the
[14:44] wrong teachings but they protest the
[14:46] world
[14:50] they are called pentecostals
[14:54] they are supposed to be following the
[14:55] bible
[15:23] they have taken
[15:25] god they have to handle the word but in
[15:26] unrighteousness
[15:30] they have worshipped the creature more
[15:32] than the creators
[15:35] you see also the scripture says that
[15:37] they have taken the form of god
[15:40] in each fight and check out what they
[15:42] have denied the power they are wrong
[15:45] let me tell you church
[15:48] never come to that place
[15:52] where you have a form of god in its
[15:54] financial criticism
[15:56] of the world
[15:58] let me tell you what the power is
[16:45] [Music]
[17:15] but you see when you come to
[17:24] [Music]
[17:51] [Applause]
[19:22] is
[20:04] they
[20:29] [Music]
[20:30] it means you cannot change your
[20:32] situation
[20:34] are you
[20:36] hallelujah amen
[20:38] many people in this generation
[20:41] they have loved god because of something
[20:44] they have a form of god because of money
[20:50] because of healing
[20:54] because they want a miracle
[20:57] really they do not have interest
[22:07] when you hear the word of god
[22:10] [Music]
[22:24] from
[22:38] when we
[23:20] and it makes
[23:47] where do you find that in the
[24:00] but like i said you know they
[24:02] you know make up and then you know dress
[24:05] like man
[24:07] let me tell you something about our
[24:09] generation
[24:11] the women started by dressing like man
[24:32] to change their orientation
[24:36] they shoot them with hormones
[24:41] sexual orientation
[24:44] but
[25:28] [Music]
[25:41] it that way
[25:43] at least in our country they will say
[25:44] you as being segregated
[25:48] but if you you you go in this some of
[25:50] these developed countries
[25:54] and you say that a woman is not a man no
[25:56] government
[25:57] and a man is not a woman no more
[25:59] psychiatrists i will also say you are a
[26:01] bigot or something
[26:04] you see you you're not being considerate
[26:07] you are giving head speech
[26:09] [Applause]
[26:17] one of the justices of the of the
[26:18] supreme court that they were trying to
[26:20] interview what was
[26:22] the best
[26:30] [Music]
[26:31] you know my one of the uh lawmakers
[26:33] asked
[26:35] him
[26:48] this is the question that even my four
[26:50] year can
[27:18] so you don't know who a woman is that's
[27:20] thomas yeah and you are apparently
[27:23] supposed to be a woman
[27:24] and i will take it
[27:26] and you want to be the one to judge
[27:30] that you cannot even charge the very
[27:32] smallest things
[27:46] that god made the man in his image
[27:51] and then he took a rib out of his name
[27:54] and out of that he made a woman
[27:57] a woman adam is the one who called her a
[28:00] woman
[28:14] there
[28:29] there's nothing i have wrong about that
[28:30] woman
[28:33] i am saying this to you
[28:35] this is the reflection of our generation
[28:39] the mind of the people they know whether
[28:42] or not i've been slowly slowly going
[28:44] away from god see that damn problem
[28:48] and we've come to a place because what
[28:50] do we want to say when they cannot
[28:52] actually recognize who they are
[28:56] and that's the same spirit oh come on
[29:00] they could wear our trousers
[29:05] and still be a christian
[29:08] christian of god
[29:38] church
[29:40] for years and years
[29:44] because they were always religious and
[29:46] christians
[29:48] but they were never really changed
[29:54] god is going to marry a woman of virtue
[29:59] he says his wife has made herself ready
[30:03] his wife reads herself by
[30:05] the word oh
[31:12] [Music]
[31:29] and i will just talk about her but let
[31:31] me read the quote as i talk about it
[31:36] from the message
[31:41] the prophet says now here she had to
[31:42] take on the disgraceful part should path
[31:49] to lay down
[31:57] be called anything she wanted
[32:12] he and she was following exactly the
[32:15] rules that was laid down to her
[32:21] you know this the book of esther is a
[32:23] very wonderful book of study
[32:36] i don't think i need to go back to the
[32:38] story because i know that this is uh
[32:40] most of you
[33:21] because they had left their first estate
[33:23] they had left bethlehem
[33:27] and gone to uh more than the uh the land
[33:31] of more mirage
[33:33] and so that is where the boys of eddie
[33:35] mentioned now my were
[33:42] that's also a good story to show you
[33:44] brother my sister my brother your
[33:46] marriage can never prosper if it is out
[33:48] of the world
[33:56] your relationship with your wife cannot
[33:58] see the light of day if there is no
[34:00] christ in the middle of your name
[34:14] [Applause]
[34:45] even if god gives me a child now that's
[34:48] on the neighbor and poor man
[34:50] would you wait for that little boy to
[34:52] grow and then he marries you
[34:56] surely there is no hope don't worry
[35:00] even to be honest things have gone by
[35:02] zach
[35:03] go back
[35:05] to go back your people yeah yeah thank
[35:07] you you know those days when the pastor
[35:09] comes and the word you know it's like as
[35:10] if it is chasing you away from the
[35:12] church
[35:13] where everybody wronged
[35:28] as
[35:55] we need to make a choice
[36:23] is because of my sons
[37:05] was actually not telling them how to be
[37:07] keepers at home
[37:09] [Music]
[37:10] she was telling them
[37:14] i don't need you anymore
[37:16] you don't need to be keepers
[37:34] let us look at these things
[37:36] to be a kind in a realistic way
[37:38] let us not be spiritual for a moment
[37:40] forever
[37:42] yes i love you
[37:44] but surely
[37:47] even if you are to have a boy now
[39:30] i can't help but remember
[39:32] the day that jesus met his disciples
[39:37] they asked them
[39:38] do you also want to go
[39:40] but they
[39:48] let me tell you the only reason why we
[39:49] are following this message is because of
[39:51] the word of eternal life
[40:41] [Applause]
[41:04] your eyes on the price a month to go
[41:08] i didn't believe this message because of
[41:10] my wife all because of the husband that
[41:12] kid is
[41:16] but because of eternal life
[41:30] but whether you are sick
[42:00] yes
[42:18] [Music]
[42:28] the bible says he that finds himself
[42:29] will lose him
[42:32] but he that loses himself
[42:36] all these things are in the scriptures
[42:40] what the word calls
[42:42] foolishness change of sickness god
