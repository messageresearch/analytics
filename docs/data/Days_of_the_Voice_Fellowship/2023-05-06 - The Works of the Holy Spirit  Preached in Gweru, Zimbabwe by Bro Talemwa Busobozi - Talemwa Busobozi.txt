just I think about three four services so there was a preacher that was preached always preaching after me so there are so many ministers it was six services so it was 30 services so after I preached there was another preacher I think the church knows the testimony about Uganda Uganda amen amen and how how ugandans are different from Zimbabwe Uganda they just love the Lord so that time there was a

greet you all in the precious name of Jesus you sing so beautiful yeah I enjoyed all the music I say God bless you amen amen um I'd like to uh thank Pastor Syed for the invitation to come and be with you here he said very powerful words which I don't think but I I Pastor said has a powerful Ministry he shook us up when he came to Kampala we really enjoyed that and I tell you many people were filled with the Holy Spirit so I'm so glad to be identified with such a Ministry amen amen and so you see I've lost half of my voice I was just telling past aside you know he he gave me up and they squeezed all everything out of me you know like he said we came and we've been last weekend we were in South Africa and we had to uh two meetings there then we've been at Highlands and also at uh also and and so it seems like it's been two weeks of ministry in Zimbabwe [Music] [Music] blessed us myself and Rebecca together I've been preaching this message by God is great for 17 years now and I've been married for 10 years as you can see I'm just starting out in life and I'm glad that I'm starting out with the message there is no life anywhere else I thought I was going to be a reverend priest my father was a priest but somehow God you know caught me and pulled me out of that message you know anything else out of the message and he has brought us in this message so that we can be prepared for the Rapture so this is a holy ghost message do you believe that and so we are all being prepared I might be from Uganda but we are all children of the same family let us sing it's the all-time Holy Spirit and the devil won't go near it oh my this is our Anthem as Believers of the message amen I don't know where's the song leader can you help me start it all right amen Holy Spirit and the devil won't go near it that's the reasons [Music] [Music] oh it will make you stop your life give me release [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] just give me Hallelujah foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] makes me love everybody [Music] [Applause] where now it's all over me he is keeping me alive you know the song It's All Over Me he is keeping me [Music] alive my Jesus is keeping me amen well can you grab your hands and that's for Jesus if he's keeping you alive he is an all-time religion the whole time Holy Ghost is keeping me alive with Jesus is keeping me Hallelujah is the Holy Ghost and Fire is keeping me alive [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah she's keeping me Hallelujah amen where the Pastor said I can be free I just wanted to be free hey man I think we should just go to the word right away and we're going to read John chapter 14. 14. 7 it was very cold in Johannesburg but it is it is very hot yes it is at home so who knows so I feel at home now amen amen we are reading verses 7.7 we'll read up to verses 11.11 if he had known me you should have known my father also and and from henceforth you know him and have seen him and Philip said unto him Lord show us the father and it's sufficients Jesus said unto him have I been so long a time with you and yet has to thou not known me Philip he that has seen me has seen the father and how says Thou then show us the father Jesus thou know that I am in the father and the father in me the word that I speak unto you I speak not on myself but the father that dwareth in me he doeth the works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very wax sick let us pray kind Heavenly Father we want to commit ourselves now to you as we are going to sit down and listen in to what the Holy Spirit has for us father we are ready to hear from you we desire to hear from you we are expectant Lord for what you're going to do Lord we give ourselves to you now in Jesus name we pray amen you may be seated amen so you know while I was reading this uh portion of scripture I noticed there is one portion that Jesus never said because it wasn't the time yet I wanted to read it again where he says verse 11. believe me that I am in the father and the father in me there is another portion there that street the father is in me I am in the father and I am in you that person came later on right here as they were laboring to know who Jesus was speaking on a pre-rupture conditions the words of the Holy Spirit The Works of the holy spirit so he yeah they were trying to labor to find out who Jesus was and and you know Philip comes and asks him a direct question he said we are tired of this confusion sometimes you speak as the father and sometimes we speak as the sons I tell you this is one of the things before I came to the message and maybe there is somebody here that might be confused by the godhead that whatever you read in the Bible you see a war not like he there is a father there is a God in heaven and again there is another God here so how many gods do we have but I'm here to tell you we have one God and if you can't explain it is oh [Applause] um and he remembered in the Old Testament when the prophet of God prayed and he said oh God Open the Eyes of the young man that those that be with us and in a moments around them maybe Philip knew that scripture he respected Jesus but Jesus did not do that yes Jesus stand to feel it Hallelujah Philip Philip have I been with you Philip said show me show us the father [Applause] [Applause] you have seen the father [Music] [Music] and the father is in me [Music] the words I speak I speak not of myself hallelujah amen and then he says [Music] he realized it is still difficult for him to understand he said all right all right let me bring it down if you don't believe my word if it is how long have you been in the message for five years and you are still confused they have something that will take all your doubts away he says believe the very words Hallelujah if there is something the devil cannot describe Hallelujah because then it is not just a talk and it is not just words it is God coming down and you know the only way we can be able to recognize Christ Jesus was a man but the words he did the works of Jesus God was vindicating him through the works of the Holy Ghost [Music] very early in the morning and I saw that my father was poisoned he's a black man um you say he's a black man all right he's a black man but dark skinned okay but I saw that his skin was so dark because of the poison now if a black man was becoming dark I know it was really real so in that trance I saw that he was poisoned and that I needed to pray for him and that the place where that if he does not if he changes his mind that he does not go to the place where he was planning to go he would survive the poison I got my phone and called him very early in the morning and I told him father are you okay he said sure yes I am I told him now I'm speaking to you these are not my words of the Holy Spirit you know by the time I late evening [Music] I said what is happening [Music] [Applause] foreign and when I went to the church we had the service at the whole time I was praying that the pastor finish us to preach so I can pray dancing [Applause] let me tell you we should always come to church will come in that condition but God who can use that word and so as as uh you know we went into prayer I like prayed my heart out I won't cry to the Lord and then friends Hallelujah after two hours when I went outside it seemed as if he was waiting for me to get to get outside he called me and he said [Applause] foreign [Applause] Jesus Christ [Applause] and so here it is John also wanted to find vindications when John saw Jesus and he introduced Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God but after a moment [Music] and we tend to forget what our God can do but I want you to see here John in John Luke 7 19 Luke 7 7 Panama 19. oh my oh man let's be a little bit fast and I say John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus saying he that should come here all look we foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] foreign foreign [Applause] [Music] go and ask them PCM convert Mary to Paris you know some younger men want to do that you know in the message when I've been looking around I can't find anyone I think I should do PCM I should go out there and get get a ricketta a modern recater that way a beauty queen and I should preach to her converter you see I mean this is John you are now doubting what God can do maybe this will help some young people I was in Ethiopia Ethiopia and maybe some Believers some of the ones I'm going to talk about maybe are streaming or maybe we'll listen to this later and I was first with a challenge that this was the first as far as we knew at the time the first message Church in the country has 100 more than 120 million people Ethiopia universe 80 million 18 18 18 times smaller one oh my good Lord in Uganda we have 40 40 something 40 million 40 something and and so in ethical they have 120 Minutes 120 million and so there was no other message the message you went to Ethiopia just recently married about 10 years ago and we have our fellowship a few young boys maybe we had about 10 or less and they were all not married and now if they don't find a wife from among themselves what are they going to do so I was faced with a challenge I went back to the message and I was very busy feeling so bad about the circumstances maybe God will understand Believers from here for them to marry or choose so what are we going to do so when the young man kept on asking me what about marriage what does the prophet say about marriage I kept on saying what the prophet says hallelujah how [Music] [Music] [Applause] several people from [Applause] I've opened my eyes [Applause] hallelujah amen and that young lady is now supporting him uh and they're the pastors of the church and I'm here to encourage you that everything you need is in the message there is nothing more that we need out there Hallelujah no matter your situation no matter what you are going through everything is in the message and so John the Baptist said go and ask him should we wait for another yeah and in the same hour in the same hour Jesus cured many informities yes [Applause] now I'm imagining when Jesus came and met these people from a man who had received doubts about his ministry Jesus had many options to confirm his ministry to be regardless Ministry maybe he would have sat them down and he gave them a little gospel spanking and preach to them a sermon of one hour maybe he would have sat down with them and debated with them over back and forth maybe he would have told them something that would have opened their eyes maybe would have opened in the prophets the courts of Isaiah the courts of Jeremiah and he would tell them you see this quote here he's talking about me Jesus did not do that what did he do ah [Applause] imagine where God begins to manifest himself in the body of believers foreign when Jesus was upon the Earth he said know that I am in the father and the father in me in the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but a father that dwareth in me and notice these will not be the works we shall do you know you are not saved because of what you did and therefore nothing that you will do yeah it's going to be his Works notice I said the works of the holy spirit it's going to be the works of the Holy Spirit John 14 10 he says here it is most evident set forth you know this is that the perfect manifestation of God in the sun was by the indwelling spirit manifesting in word and works that is exactly what we have been teaching all along how many believe that when the bride will get back to being a white bride let me first post there and I want to ask you a question do we have a word Bride In Our Generation do we have a white bride or we don't know the bride that is made ready we have received the word in our generation [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] she will produce the very work foreign let me tell you we talk about the third pool we've had so many people say and indeed they quoted like brother Barnum says now it's manifested but not in fullness we're waiting for that moment Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you know that kind of gospel keeping us waiting wait wait it's coming it is coming I want to say this yeah this is the time we are the people must produce hallelujah amen we are the people that must produce those words this is the pre-rapture conditions maybe I'll go maybe I don't know I'm foreign [Applause] [Applause] and begin to do the works the spirit is God the word is God where the spirit is God the word is God they are all one they say one cannot walk apart from the other um we can't have the word and have not and don't have the spirit [Music] if if one truly has the spirit of God he will have the word of God that is how it was with the prophet they had the indwelling spirit of God and the word came to them praise the name of the Lord age he says now we are at the end of this time each man has looked at the end of his Junction for the coming of Christ [Music] but they had a look to the uh they had a lot to look forward to the returning of the Jews the flying saucers in the skies and all those things that we see today but we are at the end time we are here now by the way the reason why I love the message is the message reveals things at the world even the world doesn't know about it and he says those are investigating angels they know the church was to receive the the power that would work in the church the same works of Christ because as the shadow becomes deeper and deeper foreign [Applause] after a while the shed gets closer and closer and the shed is the same thing and that time is now when Christ and the bride must become one now the spirit of God has worked under justification sanctification [Music] because you know performing and doing the very same things what is it the church and Christ have become do you know what happened foreign [Applause] foreign [Applause] and the branch Bears record of the vine because it draws its energy and life from The Vines the first branch that came from this vinegar he says they wrote a book of Acts behind them we see the way the Holy Spirit acted in that first chapter and then we believe that if this original vine why because it's the same life it's not going to be a trial and error when we talk about speaking in tongues for instance it's not going to be the ministers teaching the people how to speak times like it was in the original you will have tanks and interpretation of times sickness has dropped writing a book of Acts behind it and when I say it's not us going to manufacture it this reminds me I'll give this testimony I'm in the church this sisters helped support the work of God ever since we went to Ethiopia and now things look like she's reached the end and she's not receiving a breakthrough people and she comes to the options she's crying Pastor what can I do now I looked at her and she was crying you know you cannot hug a sister you can't do that so I feel sorry for her and then right there and then the anointing of the Holy Spirit comes let me tell you church it's one thing to know the word [Applause] you know the Holy Spirit was revealing things about her life [Music] she handed it over to the boss and the boss went through it and he was so happy report I said you are the best she said she started bragging she said would you also like me to take over the one of the headquarters and this was a big company and this is I didn't even have a degree he didn't even have a diploma so I came out of the vision and I the anointing came on me and I said you are going to get a job in a big company if it doesn't happen then it is not the Lord spoke but it is he took exactly two weeks there was a big company like uh like Western Union that needed a representative in the country and then but they needed someone who had the credentials and somebody who also had good English but this sister did not have the credentials but she had a good English and she had always helped us and God used [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] today and forever that sister received a job and she did the best for several years and I'm telling you that same God he's with us here today if you have any doubt in your heart if you have any questions like John DeBarge there is only one solution The Works of the Holy Ghost of the Lord is always waiting he's on standby he's waiting for somebody as long as they are believers if the devil wants to bring him down the end of the Lord is waiting to just God forgot to tell him he is waiting to come the works of the Holy Ghost Musa [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] if you believe it repeat [Applause] begin to mention your condition tell him about your conditions and I'm telling you our God is never late he knows about your situation everybody stand on our feet stand on your feet it's not about what you can or cannot do it don't worry about your weakness don't worry about your insufficiency he is a living God he wants to prove himself he's looking for an opportunity well yes I believe that with all my heart Lord thank you Father pray without doubting [Music] lift up your voice tell him Lord I believe [Music] he wants to do for you thank you oh Jesus oh Jesus yes Lord Jesus yes Jesus [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] your Mountain may be big but remember this Jesus Christ is bigger he understands he knows even what
