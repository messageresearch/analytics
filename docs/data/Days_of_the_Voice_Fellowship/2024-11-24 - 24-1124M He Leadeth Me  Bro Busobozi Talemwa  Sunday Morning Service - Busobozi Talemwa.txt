send our greetings we certainly understand for for her situation to you younger people don't miss CH because you're not feeling well for only a few who have certain situations sister is expecting we just need to pray for her amen deons I see many young men standing behind 3723 3723 the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not utterly cast down for the Lord uphold him with his hand am I have been young and now I'm old yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread he is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed amen we say Amen [Music] amen amen you may be seated please um we were here those of you who did not come it was quite unfortunate because I gave some special announcements and it is difficult to speak such details online because it's meant only for the church so we met and prayed over those things perhaps after the service um I have a moment and um try to give it to you in brief amen but uh in the short time that we were here yesterday one of the things we were praying for was the youth meetings and then the next was the land our church land and as I was um still as we were still praying God started answering and there's a brother pastor friend of ours and sent me a text said I I heard about your land F I would like to support that's why you had the 1.7 million came from say our Our God you know answers it may not be at a go but little by by little amen and as I will share with you in details later on after the service I'm believing for us to be in our land um before our rent here which ends in August [Applause] expires I don't want us to pay any more R don't don't walk out before you know how service ling a little bit you know it all came from I got inspired from what pastor preached there's something you can do about so there's something we can do about amen praise the name of the Lord but this morning for a little while I want to speak to you on the message he leadth me tell your neighbor he Le me the steps of a good man are ordered by the [Applause] Lord I would like to speak about Jesus and what he does for those who believe in him Believers are not like the rest of the people in the world we are special we are a royal priesthood a president cannot come out from his um presidential Palace without a lead car will always be led a king cannot walk alone he will always be led how much more we who the Bible says we are Kings and we are priests we cannot walk alone we will always be L the the security Personnel always ensure the path is perfect and I want to say to you this morning if you're a child of God you know God will always ensure that your path is perfect he cannot lead you in the way of death he cannot lead us this far to leave us if it is God and it is him leading our lives he is leading Us in perfect path many times sometimes it looks like the path we headed by following Jesus is a path of loss it sounds sometimes and it looks like a path of impossibilities that's what God does to prove he is God God likes leading Us in path that man cannot even dare lead so that after he has taken us through he will not take the credit no man will take the credit God himself will be glorified God wants to be glorified in your life that is why he wants to lead you that is why he wants to guide you but many people don't want the leadership of God and the leadership of God can only be found in a place of prayer but I want to say this morning he leadth me and the Bible says the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord they are ordered by the Lord they are led by the Lord he didn't say even the journey he said the steps that's why he told Israel every footstep is possession every step he leadth you even sometimes when you have thought that you are in your deepest of Valley he will lead you we sing a song that the love of God go the highest star and even goes to the lowest hell His Eye Is on the spir listen God cannot I want to show you a principle this morning God cannot lose his child are you his child now personalize it God cannot lose you remember the years you thought he had lost you remember the situations you thought he had Forsaken and you thought you were lost but you know I have news this morning can never lose any of his own the the Bible says he has inscrib as in the palm of his hand amen wherever we go he's watching us wherever we go he knows where we are by the way let me say this also even when you are in sin there was a time when you were in sin there was a time when you in your weakness deepest of hell you know what our anchor holds because our anchor is in Christ by the way if the devil knew that he would stop tempting God's children because he cannot lose this amen there is no amount of sin there is no amount of weakness there is no amount of wor there is no amount of demons can destroy seed of God God is looking at his SE and none can get lost hallelujah amen none can get lost amen wow none can get lost not even you not even you not even you none can get lost no amount of denominations can swallow us let me tell you when you plant a seed or when you bu itat under the soil you would think it is lost but that seed because it is seed it has a gam of life it cannot die forever when it dies and it decay then it germinates what am I saying sometimes the devil has wanted to BU some of you in some sins and also in some denominations but do you know what amen we are seed tell someone I am a SE of God I am a seed of God I am a seed of God because we are SE and here we are we have germinated Hallelujah when we died the devil thought it was our end but that was our beginning praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah amen amen hallelujah my my my my the steps of a good man ordered by the Lord and He delighted in his way God Delight in the way of a good man amen oh my your amens are very small though he fall I feel like preaching this morning though the righteous man fall the good man fall he shall not be utterly cast down why for the Lord upold him with his [Music] hand Hallelujah I have been young and now I am old yet I've never seen the righteous for seconden I have never seen a wrers for second why are we rightous oh praise God why are we righteous listen to me this morning not because we are doing works of righteous although that is good but why are we righteous go back to Abraham the Bible says Abraham believed God he just believed God counted to him for righteousness so in other words a Believer is right he that believes the word by faith you are righteous now when you believe the word you know God puts the vitamin in you to become righteous by faith before you did a a work good or bad are you hearing me before you did any or good thing you became righteous by believing the word oh you are not understanding that's why the Bible say he that is born of God cannot see and listen and he explains it and he says why because his seed remains in him he cannot s it is impossible for the righteous to sin it is impossible for the righteous to fall utterly it is impossible now when you believe the word you receive the power of the world which is the power of the holy spirit that is the power that now makes you amen do the works of righteousness now those are not your works the Bible oh my good Lord the Bible says our works of righteousness as filthy rugs before God so you know so he doesn't want it but there are some other works he wants he wants his own works his works are perfect in US amen when we receive the power of the Holy Spirit then we begin doing his work we begin living his life that's why the Bible says amen I am dead I am dead and the life that I now live amen he says it is by the faith all the Son of God not the faith in the son oh my you people enjoying the word this morning not by faith in the Son of God but by can we read it now this morning my God let me just let me just get to the scripture because that's wonderful praise the name of the Lord hallelujah Galatians Chapter 2 vers 20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me are you there okay if you can't find it in your Bible look on the screen and I want you to follow me closely I am crucified everybody say I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live I live no no he says I live but yet not I I live yet not I are you getting it I live yet not I but Christ live in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God not by faith my faith in the son it is oh my good Lord I don't live by my faith the Bible says that just shall live by faith with faith not their faith your faith can do anything it is by the faith of the Son of God it's by the faith of Jesus so imagine you know he is in you and he's believing his word he is in you is doing his work it is the faith of the who loved me and gave himself for me that's why when you receive the Holy Spirit there are certain things you can no longer do because the because he is in you living his life in you and is leading you now can you be lost when he's leading you I ask you can you be lost we cannot be lost if he's leading us and he says I I've never seen the righteous for remember who is the righteous the believer in the word know his seed begging bread he is ever merciful and lth and his seed is blessed you will never beg for [Music] bread I have always believed that upon my life and don't tell me this is Pentecostal approach in anywhere we are Pentecostals we are the real genuine pente so you should always learn by the way let me tell you if you want to enjoy the word you should not you should always learn to take the remas take it personally hear the word of God for you don't just hear the Bible being read when I read that will never beg for bread am so that's why I speak to you that you will never beg for prayer now when you believe it it is applied upon your life amen praise the name of the Lord so now Saints the way of the Lord the righteous Delight in it but the way of the Lord is not easy the way of the Lord is not Dy often hard squeezed difficult not popular when you receive and accept the way of the Lord because the way of the Lord is the way of the word either way let me tell you you can never accept the way of the Lord and you fail to make enemies because the way of the word is not popular many don't believe it many don't believe it many refuse it so when you accept it they begin to separate themselves from you many people struggle with worldly friends I can't leave them you don't need to leave anyone the only thing you need to do is to walk in the way of the Lord if you live in the way of the Lord those worldly friends will automatically dis Fellowship you if you take your stand and you say this is what I believe I am a young person but I don't CL I don't drink alcohol I don't keep no girlfriend boyfri I don't go to automatically you will make enemies with one but the problem with our younger generation they cannot take their stand but you see if you make a stand brother you will always be in the way of the Lord and the way of the Lord is perfect when you are in the way of the Lord he will begin leading you how many want to be Leed of the then he will begin leading you he will begin leading you in your marriage some of you who are married you should also walk in the way of the Lord amen what is the way of the Lord the position of a man and a woman stay in your place stay the Bible says man love your wife even as Christ loved church and he died for it so the man should love his wife to the extent that he's ready to die for amen Brothers you should love your wife if you are close to a married person tell them love your wife yes love her let not don't be overly you know like many people are angered and then they want to slap them if I was not a Believer I would have showed you that is not love imagine if Jesus was treating us like that the way of the law his man don't beat your wife but so you may not beat up with your hand but many of you message Believers are beating them with your words stop that if you do that you are not loving your wife amen love her that is the way of the Lord cherish her that is the way of the Lord show her love that is the way of the Lord walk in the way of the Lord will lead you all through amen same thing to you woman submit yourself to your husband now submission does not mean when you agree or when things are going well or when you have understood each other submission is humility you cannot submit to someone you do not honor when you honor someone then you are able to submit when you honor someone you reverse them you respect them even when they say something which you do not agree with and you feel you can't take your idea first submit then discussion can come after but these days they find women when instead of submitting the nose the mouth will be in the nose they become very angry very Grievous to them everything the man says is Grievous now when I'm preach these things I don't mean my wife is is like that but what I'm saying is simple to the married couples are you hearing me submission means humility humble yourself when you don't humble yourself you cannot submit when you how do we submit to the word sometimes we don't agree with what he say but because we are believers we humble ourselves is it the word yes okay I believe it let him have his way now that is working in the way of the Lord to you young men younger ladies same thing to walk in the way of the Lord you have to submit and when you walk in the way of the Lord then the Lord will lead you every step of way some people believe the word for the church only that is religious spirit let me give you a little pastoral message this morning receiving the word and applying it only for church and in church is a religious spirit you have to believe the word and apply it in every situation in your [Applause] life to the extent it will even control where you are renting from yes it will control you cannot go and rent 40 km away from church simply because your friends are there that is not the leadership of God the word should control you ask yourself what does the word say that do not forsake the assembling of yourselves together as the man of some is now if you go in 40 km will you be able to Fellowship regularly if not then you better leave that place find another place find another place sometimes it even is even jobs there are some jobs Believers cannot take do you know that the world controls every aspect of your life and you find a Believer selling beer it is only business shame on you he cannot lead you because you're not walking in his way my message this morning is pastor and you better say Amen you must allow him to lead you the way of the Lord is not easy to work in it you have to allow submit yourself to the word praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah even what you dress even what you eat I mean basically in every aspect of our life even the course you decide to do at University the word should guide you even the university you are picking the word should guide you you find someone picking a very far University where there is even no Fellowship there and they are not even concerned and many of them of them go and back slide they back slide and then they get a in education what good is it to get all the world and you lose your soul Jesus should be number one in your life we are not going to be religious just we are going to be Believers we are going to walk in the way of Lord going to yield our to him so he can lead us I want him to lead my life I want him to lead my marriage I want him to lead my church I want him to lead my children in every decision I made I want him to lead me he leadth Us in the paths of righteousness and brother bam in the message birth pains he speaks about he speaks about the message which was given to him praise the Lord I think we have a problem with this monitor here and so this message was given to him and uh it was in a way of tongues and it was in French and someone came and um interpreted the French and uh I want to read these words to you this is the interpretation of those of that message because you have chosen the Narrow Path the hard way thou Hast walked of your own choosing thou has picked the correct and precise decision the correct and precise decision and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee what a glorious decision thou Hast made this in itself is what is that which will give and make to come to pass the tremendous victory in love [Music] divine I said praise the name of the Lord Brother bam made this decision this is 1965 I think this message was given to him around 1963 or there we know by this time the people had left him many had left him because you remember brother bam had three pools in his ministry as I spoke to you this morning I'm giving you a pastoral message so I want you to keep focused I don't want to preach like an evangelist this morning what because I'm going to give you more details amen so you can eat and your soul can be fed and I want you to follow closely are you hearing Brother Sam and so brother Bram had three pools in his Min the first pull and now when I said pool it means a phase something that pulled people to his ministry and the first pool of his ministry was the the the healing the gift of healing miracles signs and wonders now this happened in the first phase of and as an evangelist traveled wild over people received him churches accepted him old preachers started working with him people like Lind I think this there was another man there there several of them and so they started working with him and you know he was beloved by everyone churches we are telling him come join us oh we shall support you you have a powerful gift he never joined anyone but still they received him to an extent one time in Canada you know the Oneness Pentecostal and the tarian Pentecostal they called him in the message I think I don't remember the probably God explained and so they they called him and they sat down with him and they were pulling each of them because they wanted him for the gift he had but now they had seen he was working with the tarian and working with the p with the Oneness same time so now they were pulling to have him on one side and they told him brother Bram you a good preacher you have a good gift but we want you to make your decision which side are you on are you on the trinitarian side or are you on the Pentecostal on the on on the one side and they sat down and they began to talk to each of them and he told them you know you you believe in three Gods I believe there is nothing like [Music] that but you the Oneness you baptized in in Jesus name he said I also don't believe that because Jesus is not only Jesus he is both Lord and also Christ so his full name is the Lord Jesus Christ so he said I defer with both of you so both of you are wrong and I'm right praise the name of the Lord and so they were all perplexed so he never joined any of them he went around the world seven [Music] times and everywhere he went he was received by people in great numbers they believed and accepted his ministry many people like Oro Roberts um you know a and others they talked Billy Graham they talked positively about him they said he was a great man of God Torne even made a statement he said he saw Jesus walking in human flesh again that is St and many others spoke powerful they talked about brother bham as the most humble preacher they received him in the first pool of his ministry when it went to the second phase you know the designment of the people's hearts some started doubting they said it is mental telepathy on on Wednesday he talked about that he gave you a very good story about that and so many started walking away but because it was also having some Divine you know power and and all that you still had many following and then when his ministry reached the third pH or what we call the third pool that is now the opening of the word the preaching of the Mysteries the revelation of the seals the serpent seed teaching water baptism in Jesus name and and know women preachers and many of these things were now revealed and restored back to the church that's when you began to see people leaving him in great numbers he was secluded they divided themselves from him many did not give him a Pulpit to preach anymore because according to them the things he was teaching was against their churches and they refused to be with him anymore but you know what there was a group that believed everything he said because that group was also willing to follow the Bible Way the narrow way and that group was in Jefferson but not only in Jeffersonville that group is scattered all over the world God spoke to William Bram said record your messages it will be the food for my bride in the end time and see 50 something years later here we are believing the same message and I told you we are the fruit of his ministry the devil can debate with his message the devil cannot debate with the fruit of the message hallelujah hallelujah that is the third fold pattern over true Ministry we we looked at it the other time you know the you know the the man has to be true to the word speaking the word the truth that is how you know he's a true man of God number two his ministry has to have the manifestation and power of God signs wonders Mir Miracles happening the supernatural following his ministry that's the second fold pattern and the third fold pattern is the fruit of his ministry if someone says God has sent me to go and preach in um in in where and then brother Brian he comes here and gives us testimony and says God has sent me to go in it is all right brother we are going to support you and give you a right hand of Fellowship but when you go we we must S three things number one you must preach the true word you should not deviate from it number two God must come in your ministry with the signs and wonders and vindicate that he has called you and prove he is with through you know the supernatural manifestation and message Believers are living that out we believe in that that's why we believe in tongues we believe in in interpretation of times we believe in prophetic utterances we believe in superal Divine Healing we believe in these things because it comes behind the ministry God confirming I am behind this ministry we believe in it and we want to see it in our ministry a Ministry that does not have any of without missing my words is a false Ministry how can we be sure God is with you doesn't prove himself to be God praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah and so the third F pattern then we must also see if you come back after 5 Years brother and you been in preaching we are hearing things are happening and then you come back and then we tell you brother Brian now can we can you take us so we can see how much God has done and then by the time we reach there don't even find any soul and even the only soul that is there you made your wife we shall say brother Bri there is a problem here God never sent you so the fruit of a man is Ministry proves that is sent by God and I tell you what the devil canot debate with that proof and we are the fruit that God sent a prophet in our generation we here are not the only ones there are many others all over the world there are many in this City many churches that believe this message many all over the world every continent on Earth in every city in the world there are message Believers we have no headquarter but we have the headquarter of the world Amen we are all headed to heaven but we all preach the same is it not Supernatural people who do not have a headquarter they have no Archbishop but they say the same thing they believe the same way they have received the same Spirit oh I tell you what Brethren that is the Old Time Gospel and that's why you know we say there are people almost everywhere I I I should I think we should change that we should say there are people everywhere whose hearts are all on fire amen amen I said amen there are people everywhere we are the absolute Vindicated proof that this message is true [Music] we are not just anybody I will tell you who we are we are born again Sons and Daughters of God young people and old people who are living the life of the world who believe in baptism in Jesus name who believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost we don't only believe in it filled with the Holy Ghost we live holy Liv we marry one wife are you hearing me we don't commit adultery we don't live in fornication we have been changed we have been reborn who are we we are message Believers amen we are Christians been changed we are looking for a country for a city who build and we are on our way to canan's land who is our leader he leaded us Jesus Christ the bishop of our scho hallelujah amen and our Prophet came down and he chose that hard path when he told these things which we now believe many separated from him in his Baptist Church they separated from him in the Pentecostal they separated from him and he remained alone but he never gave up and then one one person speaking in French in tongues you know tongues can be in a human language or an Angelic [Music] language I've seen before someone who didn't even know how to say one word in English that was in Ethiopia and when the anointing came down he began speaking in English prophesying to us I asked he knowl everything he was being interpreted for he said that he doesn't know English then we knew it was times God gave him times in the English language I say so here brother bam was spoken to in the French language and so and the interpretation was because you have chosen the Narrow Path the path of the word amen you two have chosen the narrow because you have chosen the nrow part I remember when I left my Anglican church and my mother you know you know disowned me it was very hard very difficult very hard but I'm so glad this morning I can say my mother is here you to your mother will believe your father will Believe come on receive it your sister your brother your I give them to you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen because you have chosen an path hard way this message is not easy some Pentecostal preachers they say rown men here we know them they know this message by the way they know it but one of them said he's quoted saying this if you preach this message you will become a poor man I don't want to be poor because if you tell women to remove their makeup to stop wearing their long pants oh they will leave the church and you know who is in the church more than others women women are more in every Church including this church amen sisters women are usually more yes sir so the man said I don't want to be poor let me preach the go that will make meel is to make them Rich Brethren is not to enrich us this go to take us into the Kingdom of Heaven it is the gospel to change us if you do something wrong I will tell you you have done something I'll tell you sister stop putting on a long trouser I tell you brother stop drinking alcohol stop be in the right if you hear that and you have the seed of God you willake that and work with the world but for them for them they want the world they want money more than the word tell you brother all the leave me with the word because you have chosen an had way you have walked in your own [Applause] choosing you have picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way it was the word was in capital letters my way my way the way of the word is God's way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits there all of you people who have decided to choose the way of the world a huge portion of Heaven hallelujah amen you that have decided to throw away fornication throw away throw away stealing come on you that have decided throw F teaching walk away from denominations walk away from false ideas of huge portion of Heaven awaits you awaits me oh I cannot wait to get over there Hallelujah come on rejoice we have a reason to Rejoice Hallelujah am what a glorious decision you have made this in itself is that which will give and make come to pass the tremendous victory in love [Music] divine I think of you brother Julius God bless you amen am the way of the Lord has always been a narrow and hard way in anything in this life the easier path is not the one to take a decision should be made by every individual to take the narrow way I remember many times some years ago I don't know if the musicians can come or you know I had this inspiration after preaching a sermon and while I was studying these words came back to me and I started singing it by inspiration brother maybe you have to put this song on our song book I want you I don't know whether you we used to have the song I don't know whether you listen to this words all my life with truth everywh I need a change to walk in your [Music] way hallelujah amen give me truthy and Grace Lord to every day dear Lord give me [Music] give me [Music] TR so that I may dwell yes Lord in your praise give me truth Mercy sing with me the chorus if you can now give me truth mercy and love give me truth mercy and love so that I may dwell in your presence so that I may dwell in your [Music] prence give me Mery and love to give the Lord a clap of Praise this morning amen that's our prayer that he will help us to walk and dwell in his presence that he may help us to walk the narrow way every day amen that's where we can find Mercy and Grace and love the Bible in Matthew 7:14 speaks of the narrow way and says because straight is the gap and narrow is the way which leadth into life and few there be that find it many people want to come and walk in this way and they want squeeze in their world the way is narrow let me tell you Brethren you cannot believe this message and walk in the life of the world and still have the world on you if you do or if you can do it it simply means you have not opened your heart to believe you remember we talked about three kinds of believers Believers nonbelievers and real real Believers and we saw that you know uh nonbelievers they will come in church when they hear the preaching of the word they will be offended at it they will be offended and they will walk away but we find there's another problem a group another group which is the real problem these are the make believers they linger they stay around for a very long time they behave like believers they look like Believers but they are waiting for an opportunity to sell out Christ they are the Judas of the group they will always sell out the gospel they will always betray the word but we have the genuine believer that why will believe it as long as the word said it and I believe I am a real genuine amen you can say that also to yourself remembering the Lord 1963 says who walks the right life with God who takes the straight and narrow way but what knows what to be misunderstood [Music] means and the prophet says I am misunderstood every person all you Brethren that try to live right and you sisters you are misunderstood your neighbors think you are some old model and they tried to throw off on you who wrot the Bible are the first one to see we the first to be there [Music] is your as if you're the one who made heav misunderstood because you try to live [Music] right you behave as if you better than anybody there is someone who told me the other day they were debating with a a preacher Minister minister you know he told him you know me I'm a Christian I can't do that it was at a place of work and this man said even I'm a but me I've been doing this all along when you Tred to live right you will be misunderstood your neighbors will think you are some old model they will throw you off why don't you attend this societies and why don't you have these card parties why don't you come to club I'm a Christian M are you the only Christian I'm also a Christian I go to the club dance what is wrong hallelujah hallelujah young people hallelujah hallelujah they tell you they are Christians they are not they are make Believers are you younger person who is a real genuine believer will not go to them card parties will not go to them clubs no you it has no part with you that's why if you a real genuine believer and you at a place of work you know these you know you sisters these men coming around and they missing themselves and you are also there there is a problem with your experience there is a problem with your experien whether it is a friend at school or lecturer or is a boss no man has a right on your body but your husband every other man this is the only place he reaches I have daughters even big daughters I don't Huger them but I look at them and see them as my some them from young but because we are not biologically related I will not begin my daughter you find a man who does that he has a bad spirit in them a woman is body sa that is what our Prophet told us can you say Amen if you believe unless a man is biologically your father do not allow any man to hug you sister even say it doesn't matter even if the man is Holy it doesn't matter who he claims to be but no man if he is no more a woman and those breast Pier him and he Remains the Same you are now quiet is the truth there she say it doesn't matter who you CLA to so some of these areful men they already possessed and you younger sisters unsuspecting you C in such a spiral my God I thought I was not an evangelist today honest I didn't prepare for that that was God speaking to you praise the name of the Lord so when you decide to take a stand way man comes what is wrong with you which church do you attend I think you the one who going to the C they will say any sort of thing to you because you have taken your stand take your stand walk in another way hallelujah hallelujah the devil is stopping at nothing in our generation is trying all his best to take the best of our young people but also God is stopping at God is not going to leave you he will hold you he will redeem you out of the hands so when you shine those things you are misunderstood when you walk the nrow way you are misunderstood God leads us as long as we walk on that narrow way ready to to walk on our way with God is dis oh we used to sing those song My Our Song readers you should you know sing those songs sometimes how take the way with godp few I've started in Jesus going through sing with me I'm going through yes I'm going I'll pay the price whatever others do I'll take my way with God is despise few have started in Jesus and I'm going through am he leadth Us in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake Psalms 23 from verse one he says the Lord is my shepherd oh my God Amen I shall not want he he not a denomination not another man not my

Bible say there is a way that seeth right a but the end at the ways of death many be like what's wrong with it you are saying like that but your conscience is judging you the way the end is death come back in his way let him lead you we do not just rush into things we should always be laid by the Lord God will not lead you into a place where his grace will not prot hallelujah amen that's why I want him to lead me everywhere he leads me I have protection Hallelujah yes sir when this sfc they taking the president they don't take him on every path they have to scout that path properly and they ensure his safety how much more Our God our God leads us in the path of righteousness don't worry brother sister sometimes when he leads you into a place that seems so difficult don't worry he will protect you he will lead you he will never lead you into temptation he will never lead you into evil even in the Lord's Prayer said lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the power and the glory forever praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah I want to show you here in the in the message the Good Shepherd of the sheep hallelujah hallelujah amen listen to this quote and I noticed at a slaughter [Music] house someone was speaking to me about how they slaughtered the ship and when they want the Sheep to come out of the corner sorry of the coral and go up to the cute where they killed the Sheep leads them watch who is leading you who is who is your inspiration you find Believers having Wordly sing singer mod because a lot of money they are going to lead you to your Slaughter he a go they will follow the goat and this goat will lead them up to the place where the killing takes [Music] place this one is my brother he's like my brother I love him very much when you look the person you see a go and this one is saying you are a Believer you know he knows my he knows my problem whenever I see people like those speaking like that about I just know there is a red flag here this one is going to be slow the you see the gods will lead them to a place where [Music] the amen deons I want these younger people bring them back bring them back sometimes when the word begins to get hard and tough you begin to see some young people sneaking out praise the name of the Lord I said I have a pastoral message today yeah watch don't go out I you let the word go deeper into you if you have not yet changed change by force hallelujah amen so they will follow the goat and this goat will lead them up to a place where the killing takes place and then the God will jump over this side and let the Sheep go right over to the that is the nature of the god so you your God friend will begin leading you let us go now way we go it's just the dancing I've been there many times but me I'm a Believer look at this one now don't behave like a it is all right just go have f is no problem are you sure my parents are look at this one now don't have parents this one is a god he's used to this thing he knows how to survive in that atmosphere you you are by a sheep you are only being led and you always trust your Shepherd but in this case you're trusting a wrong she God Shepherd and then you go there and you following and when you reach there they dance dance dance and someone comes and you a younger sister before you know him you are in the hands of someone and then you look around for your friend is my friend your friend is a God she knows when to escape and then they leave you there before you know it I think my pastor was the problem this church is the problem the church has never been a problem the problem was your God friend and your un willingness to be led by the Lord prise the Lord so the nature of the goat he will jump out and then you you are TR you know brother bam gave that story of a sister who went to a party of nonbelievers and before she knew it she was I don't know how do they call dragged or what how do they call it people you know those words okay they refuse to tell me she was dragged and but the friend knew how to [Music] maneuver swallowing and before she knew it she was in the hands and the CLS of the enemy trapped when she wakes up what have you done but you see you accepted to be by the go and if a fellow doesn't know his Shepherd real well it is hard to tell the difference between the bleeding of God and over sheep they are whole lot alike nature of them proves what they are amen oh I'm so glad that David could say the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want that's the way with confessed Christians and real Christians the god represents the world they will lead you right down the wrong road to your Eternal separation from God oh friends don't be quiet on me now let me preach this please you listening to worldly music can I have them say Amen you who are listening to the worldly music even if you don't say amen God knows you you are being led by gods yes sir you know you listen to this watching this filthy movies and videos you are being led by gods and you know what they will do they will lead you right down to the wrong road of your Eternal separation from God they will lead you into trouble so if we are sheep we better watch what kind of Shepherd we have amen even your physical Pastor don't just say you know honor because he a pastor we don't honor a man for who you know he is no no no no we honor a man for the anointing God has placed on him in All my life I pastored people who are older than me been preaching since I was 13 years I've had people call me Pastor when they could give birth to me why they were not honoring me as a man I was simply a little boy but they were honoring the anointing of God upon my life what is that anointing the anointing that leads us to the world we are not men Pleasers we are not following blindly we are not following a system We are following the word he leadth me praise the name of the Lord and he says here you should watch also the kind of Shepherd we have sheep are funny little creatures in one way here is another thing we might learn of the ship tonight when the weather is real hot did you ever see sheep they won't separate they will not separate themselves when it's very hot and one be at one place and one at another no but Right In the Heat of the day the Sheep will stand together you know what they doing they are making shade one for the other they having Fellowship brother when things are hi don't stay out there come here for Fellowship amen and would it be good if all God she when the heat was on they would all stand together when the fire are real hard and the heat is on and everything going on everywhere if all of God's leaders ship would just stand together we would have the coolness of the shed of each other the Comfort to lean upon each other amen amen leadership amen amen oh my that's why we say Amen we bleeding we are Sheep amen we are sheep of his and he leadth Us beside the Still Waters most times when the Lord leads us now listen we're going to take a corner here as we the climax so when the Lord leads us list he leads us into impossible situations do you know why for him to perform seemingly impossible things that's why David said even though I walk through the valley of The Shadow I fear no evil for thou art with me when you accept to walk the nrow way the next task is to trust God sometimes when you follow the the right path let me warn you now Things become a little tough sometimes even the money you were getting easily when you were in the wrong path sometimes it disappears when you decide to walk in the right PA many many times I've had people get baptized the right what baptism and after that soon after that Things become tough and then they get surprised Pastor I thought things are going to be better you told me behold all things are new things are very very bad and the devil begins to come on you you believe the wrong you in the wrong church that's why things are tough but many times when you follow the leadership of God it becomes tough it is a narrow you are instead of walking in the way of immorality you get married and then the devil tightens the nuts I thought it is easier it is more difficult but let me tell you church when you walk in the right way of the lord it's the time now to also add another task trust in the Lord trust in him to lead you all the way do not figure it out are you hearing me do not try to figure out anything walk by faith as it is revealed to you trust him believe him and remember oh this is a very good one he has never failed anyone who has ever trusted in [Applause] him amen oh while we're praying here brother martin got an inspiration for us for Psalms 20 and I felt this was so appropriate and the Lord was speaking to us in you know referring to our land as a church and and these other things needs we have as a church and he said the Lord he the in the day of trouble the name of the god of Jacob defend thee send thee help from the sanctuary and strengthen thee out of Zion remember all thy offerings and accept bur sacrifice Grant thee according to th own heart all th cancer everyone giving some little little offering every week God is leading you brother and God will remember every offering you are giving and I speak that by faith and in the name of the Lord he will remember every little offering G amen we will rejoice in thy salvation and in the name of our God we will set up our burners the Lord fulfill all thy petitions all of them now know I that the Lord serth his anointed he will he will hear him from his holy heaven with the serving strength of his right hand some trust in chariots and some in all but we come on church we will remember the name of our Lord they are brought down and Fallen but we are Reon and stand ight save Lord let the king hear us when we call praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah come on Church praise the name of the Lord amen if you can give me 20 more minutes now please First Kings chapter 17 if you can turn there if you can just listen I want you to see this impossible instruction many times when God leads you he leads you into impossible things I don't know how many here have reached that place where you know you are following the Lord you are sure you're following the Lord but the situation before you is impossible that's one way to know God is leading you and see God leads Elijah vers two and he tells him and the word of the Lord came unto him saying get the hands and turn thee Eastward and hide Yourself by the Brook cherith that is before Jordan and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the Brook and I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there huh did you hear that did you hear that God has told the r let me ask you friends how many know Ravens can you eat food out of its mouth he said that creature it looks weird it is even fearful well all things said no R has ever given anyone food it looks very impossible oh God's instructions are impossible but that is because he's getting ready to do an impossible thing I've told the r to feed you so he went and did according unto the word of the Lord oh my friends don't miss this now simply because of time give me more time listen to this now so he went and dwelt by the Brook cherish that is before Jordan now the impossible instruction of God leads into impossible action of the Lord hallelujah if God tells you to do anything even if it is impossible brother it is because God is getting ready to do something impossible amen and God fulfilled it the Ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and the bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook hallelujah hallelujah I don't know how God is going to provide for us but God still has Raven somewhere if he's leading us let us keep trusting him brother Hallelujah he will provide for our need believe him for the impossible things amen then the value of the shadow of death comes after God leads him in the path of righteousness the Rens come feed him then the Valley of the shadow of death comes but what did David say even though I walk through the valley of the I will fear no evil for thou with me and so it came to pass after a [Music] while that the brook dried up did God lead us here but the brook dried up because there had been no in the land my brother others were seeing no rain even Elijah was seeing no rain but that was the mistake Elijah did don't see the situation that is around you amen am trust in the Lord amen and this morning and yesterday and this entire week I've had a burden for our church because I believe it's not God's will for us to rent if this message is true and this message is true and God wants us to preach it he wants us to preach it in in a place he owns it is God's will I don't presume I believe I know now how will it be we are going to trust God for the impossible things oh I want to have some people here with some rugged Faith people who have rged faith do rged things when they believe God for the impossible things hallelujah hallelujah and so they Brook dried up fear no evil because God is with you brother his grace did not lead you here to abandon you or to destroy you he will yet do more impossible things oh that's a r word for someone here tonight God has not LED you this far abandon you amen sister jul do you believe whatever whatever God has L you is because it's getting ready he getting ready he getting ready to do something impossible but many times we give up don't give up sister don't give up brother amen sister Diana don't give up believe for the impossible Our God can do all things there's nothing he can fail amen he specializes in things thought impossible he can do what no man can do hallelujah hallelujah and the word the Lord came unto him saying ar oh yes AR amen it may be dry now there may be no water but the angel of the Lord came down and he said arise arise God getting ready now to do something on a higher level Hallelujah arise get to Zas which belongs to sidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain Thee I want to say of all people of all people to take care of the man of God chose a widow are you hearing me church he chose a Widow do not worry or be dismayed God has better plans for you too a widow is not very much for a solution but he leadth you in the path of righteousness for his name hallelujah hallelujah am you may say God what you have given is not so much that is your Widow that's your widow woman but you must believe God is the one leading you even as a church God has given us maybe 70 Millions we want much more that is our old Widow there is much more Our God can do is leading us in the path of righteousness for his name sake Amen brother Henry God is leading you well I didn't just say that it just came to me brother so he arose and went to Zar and when he came to the gate of the city Behold a widow woman was there Gathering sticks El's provision was to come from a widow woman yours may not be a widow woman yours may be a small joke your may be some unconvenient J your may be a poor background may be a failing business that is your wi woman that is all you see the impossibility God hallelujah is fixing to lead you is fixing to lead us into greater Miracle hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah God is fixing to lead us into greater Miracles amen amen there was one fact the wi woman was there God said I will be a with woman and the prophet walked being led by God and when she reached there brother the widow woman was there tell your neighbor the widow woman was there the widow woman was there your little job will be there your little provision will be there whatever little God gives you he is preparing you for a greater Miracle hallelujah amen hallelujah amen come on receive your Miracle my receive your Miracle Hallelujah am yes sir that's what we believe and Elijah called her and he said fetch me I pray thee fetch me a little water that me drink and Hallelujah and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me I pray thee a also bread in your hand and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but I have a handma of meal in my and a little oil in the cruise and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go and dress it for me and my son that we may eat and die but let me tell you Brethren if God has said the widow woman will take care of you the widow woman has no choice she cannot refuse it is a small business it is a small job it is a small work you're doing it's a small qualification but if God has said with that he will bless you rather believe it when the man of God reached there you know what he said to the woman she heard what the woman said but he did not listen to what the woman said he was remembering what God Said brother don't listen to what your business is saying don't listen to what your job is saying don't listen to what the economy is saying are you hearing me today listen to what God has said and God has said that widow woman will take care of you now I speak to you right now in the name of Jesus Christ whatever your hand has found to do God is going to bless you by that whatever you doing with you God is going to prosper you by God is going to make you even a millionaire by thaton why because he a god of Miracles yes sir he a go of Miracles and Elijah say to the woman fear not fear not go and do as you have as as thou has said but make thee thereof a little cake and bring it to me and after make me make for yourself and your son we need to begin to enter into another phase to speak to our businesses to speak to our qualifications speak to our jobs

your expectation so th say the Lord God of is the batt of me shall not waste neither shall the Cru of oil fail until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon and she went and did according to the
