[26:13] otherwise uh i'm expecting i was
[26:15] expecting also
[26:17] this is brother martin's house to be a
[26:20] part of the
[26:21] fellowship this evening but i see that
[26:24] maybe they've got a challenge of the
[26:26] network
[26:27] well uh we've already prayed and uh
[26:31] how many are ready for the fellowship
[26:33] for the bible study this community
[26:36] amen i guess we are all ready
[26:39] so now uh brother carol i'd like
[26:42] i would like you to uh maybe begin by
[26:45] giving us a report on what is covered
[26:48] or what was supposed to be covered and
[26:49] how much uh
[26:52] you mind doing that would you like to
[26:55] come here
[26:56] or you can try to go over there and see
[27:00] if the
[27:00] sound is fine
[27:16] okay bye unless you judge
[27:20] it's a privilege to be talking to you
[27:22] this afternoon
[27:25] as the program was shared
[27:30] i hope each one got the program how
[27:35] the lesson plan was
[27:40] much about it just like to give you the
[27:43] objective of the plan
[27:46] the objective of this plan it's a daily
[27:49] study plan
[27:50] to keep us reading the message every day
[27:54] not even for single day are we going to
[27:56] be out of the program
[27:57] and daily and maybe we are going to do
[28:00] as it's saying that
[28:05] form that you received so
[28:09] we got started with the chapter one the
[28:11] revelation of jesus christ and um
[28:17] we're so happy to i may say we've
[28:20] covered
[28:22] one chapter and by this time
[28:26] i hope that everyone is ready
[28:41] but all in all i pray that god gives us
[28:43] the grace
[28:44] to study is what may give us that
[28:48] young let us
[28:51] to study the one
[28:55] i'm so happy to here
[29:11] means studying the world like when you
[29:13] go to church
[29:16] you go and have singing you have
[29:18] specials
[29:20] and then the word
[29:24] what introduces us to the widely the
[29:26] songs that we see
[29:28] so i'm here to discuss with pastor and
[29:31] how we can have that song
[29:32] practice also on that team and i believe
[29:38] my plan that will be on wednesday at
[29:41] least on wednesday we do come here
[29:43] for the service that starts around six
[29:46] seven
[29:47] so if we can come early enough
[29:50] round five we can have
[29:54] some practice also conducted that is
[29:57] what i'm coming up with but it's not yet
[30:00] approved
[30:04] why i'm coming up with this is because
[30:07] many of us don't know all the songs
[30:11] in the simple book that small book
[30:14] that's why we see
[30:15] you it's not having a special song on
[30:17] sunday
[30:19] we have become church ladies and
[30:22] therefore
[30:23] really we are not doing much
[30:26] that's what i can say because
[30:30] what i know about our generation is the
[30:32] youths
[30:33] is one that the devil is so much
[30:35] targeting
[30:37] because i don't believe that the devil
[30:39] can talk like my mom at this time
[30:42] because for her it's like she's in her
[30:43] 70s now
[30:45] so if i compare her life and mine
[30:49] it's quite challenging in that
[30:53] i so much have like so many temptations
[30:57] reasons when i leave faster states i
[30:59] slow down
[31:01] i see so many women around me have been
[31:03] trained
[31:05] you understand it by the time i get home
[31:09] i've seen what my mother has not seen
[31:12] why she's at home she's sitting
[31:15] she doesn't even if she has another
[31:17] phone she has less use of it
[31:20] but you and i who i use
[31:24] are so much excited
[31:29] to these things there are four that is
[31:31] why
[31:32] i so much appreciate our pastor for
[31:34] coming up with such a plan
[31:41] i'm also happy to bring attention that
[31:45] we shall be having youth meetings
[31:49] this youth meetings helps a lot
[31:52] like for instance when
[31:56] as students many of other students
[31:59] when you come back home from school
[32:02] we are not guided
[32:06] this is the youtube that i'm talking
[32:07] about before we go to school
[32:11] it's my suggestion that we'll be having
[32:13] a meeting
[32:15] as use guided by our pastor
[32:19] and some other who can be in our minds
[32:23] to discuss with us
[32:28] also the purpose for the youth meeting
[32:31] is to allow for correction
[32:34] remember the child of god loves to be
[32:40] collected
[32:42] and therefore in whatever way it comes
[32:44] to us as long as it's a correction
[32:47] it's my prayer that will receive it
[32:55] i don't have much to say since most of
[32:57] the things i have here
[32:59] have not been approved in the past
[33:02] but i promise the next meeting which
[33:04] will be on
[33:06] friday love all these things
[33:11] will give you how the program will run
[33:17] all right otherwise i'm so happy
[33:22] maybe bless you as we share
[33:26] amen
[33:31] well brother god bless you so much and
[33:34] really thank you so much for uh for that
[33:38] wonderful introduction uh
[33:41] you know when i was in ethiopia
[33:45] on one of the last trips actually one of
[33:48] the
[33:50] the last trip they election not one of
[33:52] the last trips but the last trip that i
[33:53] was
[33:54] in ethiopia brother o'kello and i spoke
[33:57] and i really saw something in him
[34:01] that he has a burden for the young
[34:04] people to be that close to the lord and
[34:07] i know that god will use him
[34:09] so being that we are in a lockdown uh
[34:12] here of course in uganda uh
[34:16] i see i see you now sister peace i think
[34:18] you are with your sisters
[34:20] and is that a brother uh i can't see him
[34:23] clearly
[34:24] uh well whoever you are we are happy to
[34:26] be with you i think this
[34:28] these are the only young people that are
[34:30] visiting us that we have
[34:31] but there is the rest of us are from
[34:33] here we know one another already
[34:36] i want to welcome each of you and uh
[34:40] my vision is we're in a lockdown now
[34:43] and uh what are you doing at home
[34:48] well of course you me you might be
[34:50] reading books uh
[34:52] but are you reading books every every
[34:53] moment
[34:55] how many read books for two hours during
[34:57] this lockdown raise up your hand
[35:00] books not bible not bible message
[35:04] not bible message your books at school
[35:06] for at least two hours
[35:07] at least two hours so we only have one
[35:10] person my my my my
[35:13] oh we have one more there okay you guys
[35:16] are doing well
[35:17] you're really trying huh because to read
[35:19] the three books in this locker room for
[35:21] at least
[35:21] two hours i know you might you must have
[35:24] struggled
[35:25] so it's not it's kind of tough you know
[35:28] and
[35:28] uh you know the first locker down the
[35:30] people came in and they said well
[35:33] uh they tried to read even i have shame
[35:35] here i try to read and read and read
[35:37] but after a short time ah he just gave
[35:39] up and he was like ah
[35:41] we shall even go back to school so soon
[35:43] so friends what i'm saying is
[35:45] uh lockdown kind of gets us disoriented
[35:49] and you you find many people going into
[35:52] many unnecessary things
[35:53] yet they could have used time to do
[35:55] valuable things like this now
[35:57] which i think we are doing this is the
[35:59] most valuable thing that you can ever do
[36:02] sometimes you don't have enough time to
[36:04] go to get into the message
[36:06] even read the message you know it's kind
[36:07] of too many kind of they say it's boring
[36:10] because
[36:11] you know you're just reading and you're
[36:12] not used to of course if you do
[36:14] something that you're not used to doing
[36:15] certainly it will be boring for you let
[36:16] me assure you of that
[36:18] if you're not used to reading the
[36:20] message and you start reading it you it
[36:22] will be boring for you
[36:23] if you've not been listening to the
[36:25] message and you start listening to it it
[36:27] will be boring for you
[36:28] but the question is can we
[36:32] take this time of the locker down and
[36:34] use it
[36:35] for the glory of god because we do not
[36:38] know how long it will be it might be
[36:40] how many more days now
[36:44] ah this is saying yeah but you're not
[36:47] entirely sure whether to say yeah
[36:48] uh you said i know how many days of the
[36:50] days we were given 42 days how many days
[36:52] are remaining
[36:55] they gave us how many so far
[36:59] we have covered one week so how many
[37:01] days remain how many
[37:03] weeks
[37:06] 31 days so it should be 31 days
[37:09] remaining
[37:11] so let's say it was going to exactly be
[37:13] 31 days
[37:14] which many of you i can see already
[37:16] doubting it
[37:17] let us say it's going to be 31 days
[37:19] remaining in this locker down
[37:21] what would you have become if you were
[37:23] reading the message
[37:26] in this 31 days and what would you not
[37:28] have become
[37:29] if you are not reading the message and
[37:30] certainly if you not become something
[37:32] spiritually speaking
[37:33] you will become something you know
[37:35] physically or cannot
[37:36] speak if one thing doesn't possess you
[37:41] another thing will possess you one day
[37:43] in ethiopia i preached at someone
[37:45] and i titled it uh you know
[37:48] uh you know yielding oh i can't remember
[37:51] the title but uh
[37:52] i was speaking on yielding your life and
[37:55] being purposed
[37:56] on a cause and uh there is no way you
[38:00] can say that in my life i don't look up
[38:02] to anybody i don't look up to anything
[38:04] there's nothing that controls me
[38:05] certainly in your life something
[38:07] controls you and if it is not
[38:09] christ then the world or the opposite of
[38:13] christ which is the devil is controlling
[38:15] you
[38:15] so we want to really focus on the world
[38:18] we want to focus
[38:19] like brother kelly was saying yes we
[38:20] should have time also
[38:22] you know for songs and you know whenever
[38:24] people talk about
[38:25] youth literate's youth meetings youth
[38:28] that they only
[38:29] think about singing and talking about
[38:31] marriage
[38:33] i think that's not the way it should be
[38:36] you know
[38:37] the the the reason why we are having
[38:39] problems in
[38:41] in young people's lives is not because
[38:44] they don't know about marriage or
[38:45] because they don't know how to see
[38:47] actually many of them sing very very
[38:49] well i tell you many young people sing
[38:51] very very well already
[38:52] so people already know how to sing and
[38:54] they even already talked about marriage
[38:57] but the reason they have problems even
[38:59] in those areas
[39:00] is because they do not know the word
[39:04] they don't know what they believe so
[39:08] but if we can be able to get into the
[39:10] word if we can be able to get
[39:12] into the message to know what we believe
[39:14] to know what we stand for
[39:15] then i tell you no matter what comes we
[39:18] shall be intact
[39:19] even if the lord comes at any time we
[39:21] shall be ready to go
[39:23] even if we go at school the lord will
[39:25] give us grace to go through you
[39:26] understand
[39:27] so what you feed on is what you become
[39:31] so during this time because we have a
[39:33] limited time and
[39:34] uh it's not like it's a uh
[39:39] an eternity that we have we gave out
[39:43] church edges discharged eight books
[39:47] if you have it raise it up so let us see
[39:49] it
[39:52] okay there are some people without
[39:55] anyone here without
[39:57] okay yes i can see your sister uh johan
[40:00] also
[40:01] uh sister peace messiah do you have a
[40:06] yes yes you have what about those
[40:08] friends of yours
[40:10] i can't see do they have
[40:13] look if you do not have and you want a
[40:15] church edge book because
[40:17] for you uh to continue on with this
[40:20] bible study
[40:21] it will be very good for you to be
[40:22] reading and to be on the same page with
[40:24] us
[40:25] so we can be able to follow along very
[40:26] well together
[40:28] okay so uh now i uh
[40:31] we gave out these books and we have been
[40:34] trying to
[40:36] uh we have been trying to get into it i
[40:40] uh we have a reading plan brother kevin
[40:43] but
[40:43] i think has given out a reading plan to
[40:46] each and every one of you

[41:34] uh what about sister a piece over there

[41:37] the the the first chapter of this book
[41:40] she never knew okay but i believe by now

[42:58] but i see there are many actually that
[42:59] have not finished it than the ones who
[43:01] have
[43:02] finished it but i'd like to encourage
[43:05] you please
[43:06] please should i kneel down
[43:10] let me request you kindly
[43:14] protect this series this is more serious
[43:17] than anything that you have ever done
[43:19] than any books that you have ever read
[43:21] why because it is connected
[43:25] to you're going in the rupture how can
[43:28] you go to the rapture when you don't
[43:29] know that you're supposed to go in the
[43:30] rupture
[43:32] it is this message that is going to let
[43:33] you know that you are supposed to go
[43:35] interruption
[43:36] that you're supposed to get that
[43:37] confidence that you're you're supposed
[43:38] to get
[43:39] that revelation that you're supposed to
[43:41] go and now that i received these
[43:43] questions from those that have been
[43:44] reading of course
[43:45] there are there are also those uh other
[43:48] chapters
[43:49] the reading plan you will have it so i
[43:50] will not go i will not read it through
[43:52] and the purpose is that uh we are able
[43:55] to finish this
[43:56] book we get into more books as well and
[44:00] uh before i i get into the questions
[44:03] there is something i noted here that
[44:06] brother banham says
[44:08] those of you who have read
[44:12] who have read this uh introduction i
[44:14] don't know if you took time to read the
[44:16] introduction
[44:18] you can look at it there he says
[44:23] he says this is necessary in order to
[44:26] study and understand the rest of the
[44:28] revelation talking about the church ages
[44:32] for out of the ages meaning the church
[44:34] edges
[44:36] calm the seals shame can you get me a
[44:38] silver
[44:40] and out of the seals come the trumpets
[44:44] and out of the trumpet calm the vials
[44:49] did you see that yeah
[44:52] we have the book of the revelation of
[44:55] the seals
[44:56] some of you maybe just look at it and
[44:58] see it in a distance
[45:00] and you have maybe never even touched it
[45:02] how many have read it
[45:06] all of it okay so one person only
[45:11] brother keller have you read this book
[45:14] all of it so we only have one person
[45:17] that has completed
[45:18] it two people and one has not completed
[45:21] it
[45:22] and uh if you have not if you do not
[45:24] know the relationship of the series
[45:26] let me put it to you today you don't
[45:29] know the message yet
[45:30] you don't know what you believe yet the
[45:33] the church edge book is like the
[45:34] foundations
[45:35] because because the the doctrines all
[45:37] the foundational doctrines you find
[45:39] it taught here on godhead on water
[45:42] baptism
[45:43] on a on on a you know the the coming
[45:47] of the lord on the serpent seed you know
[45:49] all these other major major
[45:50] teachings it is taught in this book of
[45:52] the church edible and actually i find
[45:54] more scriptures in here than the ones of
[45:56] batabana you know
[45:57] it puts most every idea he brings
[46:01] he accompanies it with the what with a
[46:05] scripture
[46:06] and by the way some of you may not know
[46:08] but this church edge book
[46:11] is the only book that we have in the
[46:14] message
[46:16] did you hear what i say what does that
[46:19] mean
[46:21] all these others are summons preached
[46:24] sermons
[46:26] even by the bottom preached on the
[46:28] charts seven church edges
[46:29] one by one by one by one but
[46:33] this one was the only edited one they
[46:35] took
[46:36] uh uh they i forget the name of the
[46:40] brother
[46:42] what's the name of the brother you used
[46:43] to call him doctor who brother carol can
[46:45] you help me some somebody help me
[46:47] the one who edited the church edge book
[46:52] anybody knows
[46:57] yes sorry
[47:00] no no no no no not didn't say his name
[47:02] is level dr
[47:04] dr liv vale is the brother that uh
[47:09] that uh edited this church this
[47:12] exposition the book on the exposition of
[47:15] the church agents
[47:16] there are things that brother banham had
[47:18] said
[47:19] in other summons that he had not
[47:22] preached within the series of the seven
[47:23] churches
[47:24] church ages so he also told him to
[47:27] incorporate them
[47:30] so and this book was edited perfectly
[47:34] it is it has proper grammar
[47:37] whereby even if someone is reading they
[47:39] have con it has continued
[47:41] are you following me uh you're not
[47:43] following me right
[47:45] you're following me so it has continued
[47:47] so that you can be able to study
[47:49] one by one by one by one and understand
[47:52] everything
[47:52] okay so uh they may the major basic
[47:56] teachings of the message really
[47:57] are in this book once you finish it and
[48:00] understand it we can say now you
[48:01] understand
[48:02] the message now the next thing would be
[48:04] for you to receive the what
[48:06] the spirit because the holy spirit and
[48:09] understanding
[48:10] are two different things you can
[48:12] understand but if you when you
[48:13] understand
[48:14] it does not necessarily mean that you
[48:16] are filled with the life of that word
[48:17] which you have read
[48:18] so but for for the understanding for the
[48:21] purpose of understanding
[48:24] it is this book once you read and finish
[48:25] it so i'm believing that
[48:27] when we study it and many of you who
[48:29] have who have thought
[48:30] you were believers we realized maybe you
[48:32] need to believe very well
[48:34] now after reading and finishing this
[48:36] book amen
[48:38] so uh how are we doing it we are not
[48:41] going to be coming here to read
[48:44] why because it will take much time and
[48:46] it will not yield
[48:48] much so the the arrangement
[48:51] is you read at your own pace at your own
[48:54] time
[48:55] according to the reading plan which is
[48:57] given
[48:58] then we just meet here for the
[49:00] liberating we're talking about
[49:02] those things which you have read you
[49:05] understand
[49:06] yes so then maybe if you have questions
[49:08] we take those questions
[49:10] if you you know you have a comment but
[49:12] for
[49:13] for us i have three people here who
[49:15] asked questions one is sister peace
[49:17] another one is unfortunate and sister
[49:19] rachel and i think i have
[49:21] more i saw on what's up and really those
[49:24] ones who came in much later i will not
[49:25] deal with them because
[49:26] brother carol was encouraging you please
[49:28] send in your questions much earlier
[49:29] please
[49:30] you know because since we have a limited
[49:32] time we want to cover everything in
[49:34] we have already covered already much
[49:36] time now and we have not covered much so
[49:39] you can still whenever we meet we have
[49:40] much to talk about and we have better
[49:42] little time
[49:44] but i'm going to first give in about the
[49:46] first 10 minutes
[49:47] to some three or four individuals to
[49:50] tell us to give us their highlights

[49:55] they read and got to know for the first
[49:57] time

[53:00] any mind
[53:01] yeah but it's revelation so giving us as

[54:12] these meetings i thank god that when i
[54:15] was reading chapter one
[54:18] i found out that this revelation is for
[54:22] a selected special group of people
[54:26] treat and understand that not all of us
[54:28] not all people
[54:30] that we really understand the revelation
[54:33] that is for a group of people
[54:39] [Music]
[54:45] this message is not for everyone to
[54:46] understand
[54:48] that's the truth they will try but only
[54:51] the bride
[54:52] will surely understand this message amen
[54:54] i think i'm
[54:55] waiting for one more sister who could
[54:58] that be
[55:01] [Music]
[55:04] yes who has not spoken can i bother
[55:07] through that please
[55:12] okay
[55:18] and god bless you brethren yeah for me i
[55:22] was very blessed
[55:23] and my name is
[55:27] my headlight was from the first
[55:30] revelation but which says that it is a
[55:33] very good
[55:34] a big blessing for us to hear
[55:37] the books and the words which are
[55:39] written in the
[55:40] revelation and and those who here and
[55:43] those who read
[55:45] so it is a very big blessing for us
[55:56] praise the name of the lord amen now i
[56:00] would like us to at this time get into
[56:03] the questions
[56:04] uh i'd like us to get into the questions
[56:07] i know that there could be some with
[56:09] questions that
[56:11] you've come with but i'll request you to
[56:15] bring them still
[56:16] and if we don't get to cover those
[56:18] questions we'll cover them
[56:20] later even the ones i already have here
[56:22] i don't think we're going to cover all
[56:23] of them
[56:24] uh but they are
[56:31] i'm going to begin with a scripture
[56:33] first of all
[56:35] that speaks of something that i feel
[56:38] that uh
[56:40] i did not prepare that scripture but let
[56:42] me get it for you here in just
[56:44] a moment
[56:56] okay
[57:02] i guess uh brother are you able to get
[57:06] me the verse it says whatsoever your
[57:07] hand
[57:09] finds to do do it
[57:12] or do it with all your heart
[57:16] i'm just trying to search it here
[57:20] where is it
[57:24] can you ready for us
[57:33] but the butter can protect it for us
[57:45] i think it's um
[57:50] chapter 9 verse 10
[57:56] okay can you give it to us brother
[58:02] ecclesiastes chapter 9 or anyone who has
[58:06] found it okay
[58:09] right there it says uh whatsoever they
[58:13] hand
[58:14] findeth to do do it
[58:17] with their minds for there is no work
[58:21] no device no knowledge
[58:25] nor wisdom in the grave
[58:28] where with a thou goest have you heard
[58:31] how many things are in the grave can we
[58:33] mention them
[58:36] no work
[58:40] knowledge wisdom can we mention them
[58:43] again
[58:43] one work device
[58:47] knowledge wisdom so
[58:50] these things you cannot find them in the
[58:52] grave
[58:53] they are here on earth and that's why it
[58:56] says
[58:57] do what you have to do when you're still
[58:59] alive and whatever whatsoever your
[59:02] hand if you find yourself in school and
[59:03] you are studying do it with all your
[59:05] might
[59:06] you know don't go and start coupling and
[59:08] you know boyfriend girlfriend and stuff
[59:09] like that like the way they are doing
[59:10] the young people are doing in a while
[59:12] today
[59:13] whatever your hand friends do now at
[59:15] this time god has given you this
[59:17] opportunity
[59:18] to be able to get into the message and
[59:20] to read it
[59:21] god expects you to do it with all
[59:24] your might so when i
[59:28] see that some young people without in
[59:29] the locker down
[59:31] without any work to do and you have not
[59:33] even finished one chapter
[59:36] i feel ashamed i feel ashamed
[59:40] one chapter how many pages rather
[59:44] 42 pages with how many days
[59:48] 32 pages 32 pages within how many days
[59:52] four five days
[59:54] three days but really how many days have
[59:56] they had the books
[59:57] like four days surely it is a shame
[1:00:01] so i'm encouraging you that let us take
[1:00:04] this serious
[1:00:06] maybe god has allowed it and permitted
[1:00:08] it that we have this local down
[1:00:10] so that maybe your relationship with
[1:00:11] jesus christ can be improved and use the
[1:00:14] chance where you have
[1:00:16] the chance now i'm going to start
[1:00:18] dealing with the questions that
[1:00:19] are coming from those that have been
[1:00:21] reading and if your question has been
[1:00:23] answered
[1:00:23] let us know if not then we can be able
[1:00:25] to get into more detail
[1:00:28] now i'll begin with this some questions
[1:00:30] that sister fortunate
[1:00:31] asked and i don't know
[1:00:34] i don't know if you you want me to
[1:00:35] mention that you are the one who asked
[1:00:37] or not but the question was did john
[1:00:40] write everything in the book of
[1:00:42] revelation
[1:00:43] and all that he saw including the seven
[1:00:45] church edges
[1:00:47] did john write everything in the book of
[1:00:50] revelation
[1:00:52] did john write everything what do you
[1:00:54] mean that do you mean that could there
[1:00:56] be someone else who helped him to write
[1:00:59] who is this unfortunate oh you are
[1:01:00] writing does that mean
[1:01:02] is that meant to mean or to ask
[1:01:05] could there have been someone else who
[1:01:07] helped him to write
[1:01:16] okay that's good actually you know
[1:01:19] in the church edge book can you give me
[1:01:21] that quote
[1:01:23] please give us this course that the
[1:01:24] others also can be able to follow
[1:01:26] uh but the banham says describe and then
[1:01:29] he puts in brackets
[1:01:30] not the author the scribe
[1:01:34] not the author of this book is saint
[1:01:37] john
[1:01:38] the divine the brother on the on the
[1:01:42] projector you're acting quite slow now
[1:01:45] i'm expecting you to use a bit
[1:01:46] more speed than that okay there you go
[1:01:51] historians it says historians agree
[1:01:54] that he lived the last part of his life
[1:01:57] in ephesians
[1:01:58] though at the time of the writing of
[1:02:00] this book he was on the isle of patmos
[1:02:03] it is not the life story of john but it
[1:02:06] is the revelation of
[1:02:09] in the future church ages
[1:02:13] in verse 3 it is called a prophecy and
[1:02:15] that is actually
[1:02:17] what it is now there is something of
[1:02:20] note
[1:02:21] that i wanted to mention here uh i might
[1:02:24] have just said it but let me read it
[1:02:25] also from another message queen of sheba
[1:02:27] it says there is one thing about it a
[1:02:30] true child of god
[1:02:32] you can't hide him from prayer
[1:02:35] you cannot hide that true shade of god
[1:02:36] from prayer they tried
[1:02:38] to scold it out of john and they put him
[1:02:42] on the isle of patamus
[1:02:43] after they had boiled him in greece for
[1:02:46] 24 hours
[1:02:48] you couldn't boil it out of him can you
[1:02:51] imagine
[1:02:52] this man the reason why the holy spirit
[1:02:55] came to visit him
[1:02:56] when he was at the isle of patmos was
[1:02:58] that he was alone
[1:03:01] and he was in a time when the holy
[1:03:03] spirit you know
[1:03:04] sometimes you need to be alone for the
[1:03:06] holy spirit to come and visit you
[1:03:08] how would you expect to be close to the
[1:03:10] lord when in your ear
[1:03:12] there are earphones you are tuned in to
[1:03:15] some kind of worldly music you are
[1:03:16] dancing also their music
[1:03:18] sometimes they say well i just want to
[1:03:19] see what they are doing but i'm not
[1:03:20] actually participating no you're feeding
[1:03:22] on them things
[1:03:23] and then whatever you feed on let me
[1:03:25] tell you is what will
[1:03:27] will capture your spirit
[1:03:30] even when you go to bed what you will
[1:03:32] dream
[1:03:33] will be from the things you fed on
[1:03:36] what you talk about is what will be in
[1:03:39] your life
[1:03:41] regardless regardless of
[1:03:44] uh yes regardless of what whatever it is
[1:03:48] that you do
[1:03:50] what you feed on what you see
[1:03:53] what you hear you know i was speaking to
[1:03:55] was it you brother polycarp the other
[1:03:56] day
[1:03:57] and i was telling him that we have
[1:04:01] this is unfortunate where sister peace i
[1:04:03] don't see her is she around
[1:04:07] okay maybe the father was removing that
[1:04:08] so you can be able to concentrate here
[1:04:10] and i think it's a good idea
[1:04:12] look we have five senses
[1:04:18] how many know them one
[1:04:20] [Music]
[1:04:22] okay one by one
[1:04:35] how many senses five senses and
[1:04:38] by the bottom also in some places it
[1:04:40] calls them gates
[1:04:44] you see these are gifts that you have
[1:04:48] uh to your spirit you know uh well
[1:04:51] their guests on your on your body but
[1:04:54] you see
[1:04:54] these are guests that you will welcome
[1:04:57] things to come into your
[1:04:59] in into you you know things that maybe
[1:05:02] you may not
[1:05:02] think that is gonna come in your life
[1:05:04] and control you but
[1:05:06] whatever you see if you feed on it by
[1:05:09] seeing it
[1:05:10] you are welcoming it into your life
[1:05:13] whatever you hear whatever you touch
[1:05:16] whatever you know you can you can smell
[1:05:18] something and it will ruin your life oh
[1:05:20] it will bring you closer to god they
[1:05:21] didn't know that
[1:05:23] yes you know they are these sadistic
[1:05:26] perfumes have you heard of them
[1:05:27] you know someone will wear it and you
[1:05:29] will think of them for a fortnight
[1:05:32] you know it's meant to entice you to
[1:05:35] pull you to them
[1:05:36] and because it's what the devil does you
[1:05:38] know he wants to captivate to captivate
[1:05:40] the people's minds
[1:05:42] away from the lord and he would use what
[1:05:44] we
[1:05:45] what god has given to us because the
[1:05:46] devil is not a creator the devil only
[1:05:48] perverts what god
[1:05:49] has created so it takes the same senses
[1:05:52] which you can use to glorify god
[1:05:54] for you to be able to use them for the
[1:05:55] one okay now what is
[1:05:57] my point my point is simple is that
[1:06:02] sometimes you need to be alone with god
[1:06:05] in order for the holy spirit to come and
[1:06:07] minister to you
[1:06:09] you know you need to cut off some people
[1:06:11] out of your life
[1:06:12] in order for the holy spirit to minister
[1:06:14] to you
[1:06:15] you remember what happened to john
[1:06:19] they boiled him in oil because this man
[1:06:22] was considered to be one of the uh how
[1:06:26] they used to call them
[1:06:27] the enemies of the state the enemies of
[1:06:30] the people
[1:06:31] because he was preaching christ he was
[1:06:33] preaching one god
[1:06:35] he was preaching what do you believe
[1:06:37] what i believe
[1:06:39] and he was captured and they they boiled
[1:06:42] him
[1:06:43] but abandoned calls it greece or oil
[1:06:46] in a drum of oil can you imagine for how
[1:06:49] many hours
[1:06:51] this is according to historians and
[1:06:53] maybe one of them is naturally
[1:06:55] and he said for 24 hours this man was
[1:06:59] boiled in oil
[1:07:01] and they expected him to die of course
[1:07:03] to beat to pieces by morning you would
[1:07:04] be in pieces
[1:07:06] hello by morning before the man they are
[1:07:10] jumping
[1:07:12] and i'm like what is happening this man
[1:07:14] must be a witch
[1:07:15] so they captured him and put him in
[1:07:17] chains and took him far away
[1:07:20] they like condemned him to death of
[1:07:21] course they had already condemned him to
[1:07:23] death by putting him in oil but
[1:07:24] it did never work so they said these
[1:07:26] people who cannot die they are witches
[1:07:28] we should take them to places where they
[1:07:30] cannot come out of them unless they have
[1:07:32] wings to fly
[1:07:33] so they took him in an island or an isle
[1:07:36] of patmos patmos was a very bad place
[1:07:38] whereby
[1:07:39] you would have a lot of dangerous
[1:07:41] substances that you know
[1:07:43] dangerous frogs dangerous scorpions
[1:07:45] dangerous snakes dangerous
[1:07:48] all that kind of stuff was there
[1:07:49] crocodiles and this is what they placed
[1:07:52] him
[1:07:52] but god wanted him to get there so he
[1:07:55] can come and visit him
[1:07:57] and now all the entire book of
[1:07:59] revelation
[1:08:01] that we have today is now taken out of
[1:08:04] the
[1:08:05] revelations that we are coming to john
[1:08:06] while he was there can you imagine
[1:08:09] and john would see and hear things and
[1:08:12] it would come immediately and begin what
[1:08:15] begin writing and this is what we have
[1:08:17] today is the book of revelation
[1:08:18] so yes john never authored the book
[1:08:21] actually but the banham says that it is
[1:08:23] the only book
[1:08:25] that jesus christ wrote by himself
[1:08:29] the only people the others
[1:08:32] you know the the gospels the first words
[1:08:35] according to peter
[1:08:36] john mark luke but then the others of
[1:08:38] course you know by inspiration but now
[1:08:39] he says revelation
[1:08:41] was the only one that jesus christ
[1:08:42] himself dictated a wonderful one
[1:08:45] and john was only writing what he was
[1:08:47] seeing and what he was
[1:08:48] hearing and so the book of revelation
[1:08:51] that's why the devil
[1:08:52] hates it and we shall come to that
[1:08:54] because it was also a question which was
[1:08:55] asked
[1:08:56] and someone asked a question also and he
[1:08:59] said only who it is
[1:09:00] let me see who it is do you want me to
[1:09:02] mention names
[1:09:04] no okay this person asked and said
[1:09:08] is god eternal
[1:09:12] someone wants to talk about that
[1:09:16] if i ask a question on mine you say i
[1:09:18] want to say something about that
[1:09:20] please you are allowed to do that
[1:09:21] immediately okay
[1:09:23] it's got a turn does one someone have a
[1:09:25] question in that
[1:09:27] rather an answer you want to say
[1:09:29] something for that
[1:09:30] okay but the polycarp wants to say
[1:09:34] something on this
[1:09:43] okay can you unmute him
[1:09:50] [Music]
[1:09:56] [Music]
[1:10:01] many places but i want to understood
[1:10:06] and what is the bible actually saying
[1:10:09] something eternal there's no beginning
[1:10:11] and no end
[1:10:13] so many people ask the question really
[1:10:15] good stuff from
[1:10:17] nothing else are good about it but
[1:10:19] there's no beginning
[1:10:20] and there is okay that's what i
[1:10:23] understand
[1:10:27] what do you understand by the way
[1:10:37] [Music]
[1:10:56] i always say that i do not know if i'm
[1:10:58] always able to answer questions spot on
[1:11:00] like how the brother did that was
[1:11:03] fabulous but i don't think that i
[1:11:04] am very good at answering questions
[1:11:06] spot-on but anyways i'll try
[1:11:08] i will try i'll try and i hope if your
[1:11:10] question is not answered well
[1:11:12] then let us know so we can be able to uh
[1:11:15] get into
[1:11:16] more detail okay now
[1:11:20] that answer that he gave is correct yes
[1:11:23] god is eternal
[1:11:25] but there is something i wanted to build
[1:11:26] on i wanted to build on it
[1:11:28] because the sister has asked this
[1:11:31] question
[1:11:32] taking it from uh
[1:11:39] page 21 can you please open
[1:11:42] page 21 page 21 paragraph
[1:11:47] 2. can you read can someone read
[1:11:57] okay maybe you might want to involve
[1:11:59] sister john sister john you want to read
[1:12:01] that for us
[1:12:03] something on page
[1:12:07] page 21 paragraph two
[1:12:16] [Music]
[1:12:20] um
[1:12:27] people talk about jesus being the
[1:12:29] international of god
[1:12:31] now isn't that a contradiction however
[1:12:39] [Music]
[1:12:47] [Music]
[1:12:48] is
[1:12:51] [Music]
[1:12:53] manifested in the flesh
[1:12:57] amen god bless you for that now
[1:13:01] it is true that god is eternal but i
[1:13:04] think
[1:13:04] that the question of the sister was uh
[1:13:08] is jesus christ because there is a there
[1:13:10] is a portion there
[1:13:12] do you have it opened up
[1:13:18] places that which one
[1:13:23] where first paragraph
[1:13:27] oh yes people talk about jesus being the
[1:13:29] eternal son of god
[1:13:30] now isn't that a contradiction whoever
[1:13:33] heard of us
[1:13:34] a son being eternal a son being eternal
[1:13:38] sons are beginnings okay so now the
[1:13:41] question is
[1:13:42] is jesus god so if jesus is good how
[1:13:46] come now that he's not eternal
[1:13:48] okay so i think that's the question that
[1:13:50] the point of the question
[1:13:52] is if jesus is god how come that then is
[1:13:55] not
[1:13:55] eternal and by the bottom he's trying to
[1:13:58] say it's a contradiction for you to say
[1:14:00] oh to talk about eternal son but truly
[1:14:03] don't signs have a beginning
[1:14:06] actually we recall that brother wang and
[1:14:08] i recorded some videos
[1:14:10] that we are going to play one of the
[1:14:11] first one tomorrow uh
[1:14:13] the lord reading in the service in the
[1:14:15] evening and
[1:14:16] one of the videos on this line so i will
[1:14:19] leave it to be
[1:14:20] answered to whoever i ask this question
[1:14:22] in that service
[1:14:23] but i'm going to give a little more
[1:14:25] explanation on this as well
[1:14:27] now indeed god is eternal
[1:14:32] but he can
[1:14:35] come in many forms because god is the
[1:14:38] spirit he comes in many
[1:14:39] forms and that we are not looking at the
[1:14:42] ethanol cloud
[1:14:44] we are not looking at the tunnel pillar
[1:14:46] of fire
[1:14:47] we are not looking at the eternal you
[1:14:48] understand burning bush
[1:14:50] we are not looking at the eternal
[1:14:52] manifestation of god there is nothing
[1:14:53] like an eternal manifestation of
[1:14:55] god because that is only for a space of
[1:14:57] time and once that time is done
[1:14:59] it ceases to be all right so now when
[1:15:02] you talk about
[1:15:02] god being eternal we are talking about
[1:15:04] the great spirit god because god is a
[1:15:06] spirit
[1:15:07] can you read it in john do you have your
[1:15:08] bibles or you only carry the church
[1:15:10] edges
[1:15:12] john you don't have a bible oh please
[1:15:15] those who don't have a bible and
[1:15:16] you you have only a little money to buy
[1:15:19] let brother okay or not by the time you
[1:15:21] leave so that you can be sure to take
[1:15:23] your number and how much
[1:15:24] to take your names and how much money
[1:15:26] that you you are left with
[1:15:28] and then you shall be able to contribute
[1:15:29] for you to have a bible so but okay i
[1:15:31] hope you will not forget to do that
[1:15:32] next time on friday i want each of us to
[1:15:34] have a vibe okay so
[1:15:36] uh can you read for me john 20 john 4 24
[1:15:44] and i see brother martin there god bless
[1:15:45] you brother martin
[1:15:47] welcome uh and the sister there as well
[1:15:51] yes god is the spirit
[1:15:55] and they that worship him in spirit
[1:16:00] yes god is a what so god is not flesh
[1:16:03] and blood
[1:16:04] so whenever we say that jesus is god we
[1:16:07] are not trying to say
[1:16:10] we are not referencing to the flesh
[1:16:13] we are not referencing to the uh
[1:16:14] referencing to the sun
[1:16:16] we are referencing to the god in
[1:16:20] no no we're refreshing to god who is the
[1:16:22] spirit but that god is in where
[1:16:25] in in jesus christ okay are you
[1:16:28] following me
[1:16:29] okay now let me read for you certain
[1:16:31] things and then i will explain
[1:16:33] uh uh some more points here okay give me
[1:16:36] this point
[1:16:37] and how we find out that we through his
[1:16:40] grace
[1:16:41] have eternal life now the word forever
[1:16:44] is for a distance for a space of time
[1:16:49] this is in line with what you were
[1:16:51] explaining brother
[1:16:53] pelican it said in the bible forever and
[1:16:55] forever
[1:16:57] a conjunction but forever only means at
[1:17:01] but eternal means forever
[1:17:06] oh now i know that might bring another
[1:17:08] question again
[1:17:09] okay i'm waiting for you to give me that
[1:17:11] quickly please and only everything
[1:17:14] that had a beginning hazard end
[1:17:17] are you looking at it there all right
[1:17:20] where was i
[1:17:20] highlighted please for me
[1:17:26] is that the message no no no no again
[1:17:28] another message i am in hebrews chapter
[1:17:30] five
[1:17:31] and six okay so he says only
[1:17:34] and only everything that has uh okay
[1:17:37] just a moment
[1:17:38] and only everything that has at the
[1:17:39] beginning has an end but things which
[1:17:41] had no beginning
[1:17:42] has no end so god had no beginning and
[1:17:45] he has no
[1:17:47] end are you following me god had no
[1:17:50] beginning and he has no
[1:17:51] that is what you can say is there a
[1:17:53] tunnel but
[1:17:54] the question here is but abandoned
[1:17:57] before i go to our question now but
[1:17:59] abandon also brings another
[1:18:00] new idea here which actually we dealt
[1:18:02] with in ethiopia
[1:18:03] when some people were asking me
[1:18:06] is hell a ton
[1:18:10] that's a good one is hell a tunnel
[1:18:15] please let us let my show of hands how
[1:18:17] many say hell is the turn
[1:18:21] okay good bye but how many say it's not
[1:18:24] eternal truth say it's the tunnel how
[1:18:26] many seconds
[1:18:27] okay how many are not sure okay well
[1:18:30] my my mind now but the banana leaves
[1:18:33] with this and
[1:18:34] i think we will use another another
[1:18:37] quote but let us use just this one okay
[1:18:39] and how we find what is that work a
[1:18:42] little bit
[1:18:42] up up up not down
[1:18:47] okay and how we find out that we
[1:18:51] through his grace have eternal life now
[1:18:53] the word forever
[1:18:55] is for a distance for a space of time
[1:18:57] you know the bible says that they will
[1:18:58] go away
[1:19:01] they will they will they will go in
[1:19:03] everlasting
[1:19:06] punishment or everlasting uh fire or
[1:19:09] some everlasting one
[1:19:11] how does this put it
[1:19:15] okay
[1:19:18] some are going to go into life and
[1:19:21] others will be
[1:19:23] will go to hell but the bible calls this
[1:19:27] hell
[1:19:28] they will how long will they be there
[1:19:34] even ii thessalonians 1 9 3 talks about
[1:19:36] it
[1:19:37] who shall be punished with everlasting
[1:19:38] destruction from the prince of the lord
[1:19:40] and from the glory of his power remain
[1:19:41] on that
[1:19:42] what i wanted then here he says
[1:19:50] all right
[1:19:58] okay he talks about how long someone was
[1:20:01] asking me
[1:20:02] how long will hell be
[1:20:06] how long forever and
[1:20:12] forever and ever right but but the
[1:20:14] balamia says
[1:20:16] forever and ever is only
[1:20:19] to mean a space of time
[1:20:23] some people say even evangelists we like
[1:20:26] preaching it that way
[1:20:27] you you get saved now and you will go to
[1:20:30] heaven and have eternal life
[1:20:32] oh you leave your eternity in hell you
[1:20:35] either leave your eternity in heaven or
[1:20:37] in hell
[1:20:38] but actually there is no eternity in
[1:20:40] here because
[1:20:43] uh let me first finish it with this
[1:20:45] squat then i give you more you're going
[1:20:47] to enjoy this
[1:20:48] and we find out that we through his
[1:20:50] grace have within life the word
[1:20:52] forever is for as a distance for a space
[1:20:55] of
[1:20:55] time it is said in the bible forever and
[1:20:58] forever a conjunction but forever only
[1:21:01] means
[1:21:02] a time but eternal had a beginning
[1:21:06] i mean ethanol was that
[1:21:09] but etano means forever and only
[1:21:12] everything that had a beginning has
[1:21:14] an end but things which have no
[1:21:15] beginnings and had no end now
[1:21:17] here is my question now of course this
[1:21:18] is another question but it just came in
[1:21:19] here
[1:21:20] about hell is does hell have a beginning
[1:21:25] yes was hell created therefore is it a
[1:21:29] tunnel
[1:21:30] because everything that had the
[1:21:32] beginning
[1:21:33] has an end but that which had no
[1:21:36] beginning
[1:21:37] does not have an end and therefore hell
[1:21:40] was created so it has a beginning
[1:21:43] and it will have an end because the
[1:21:45] bible says that you have an end now
[1:21:48] if that if you want to ask that you will
[1:21:49] ask it separately and you will deal with
[1:21:51] it separately because
[1:21:52] i don't prepare the scriptures for that
[1:21:53] for now but um let's carry on with our
[1:21:56] question now
[1:21:57] we're talking about the eternity of god
[1:21:58] okay but eternal means forever and
[1:22:01] the only thing that had a beginning i
[1:22:03] mean only everything that had the
[1:22:05] beginning has an end but
[1:22:06] things which have no beginning has no
[1:22:08] end so god has no beginning and he has
[1:22:10] no end but did jesus have a beginning
[1:22:14] was jesus born so therefore what does it
[1:22:17] mean
[1:22:18] if jesus as a son of god at the
[1:22:20] beginning you will certainly have an end
[1:22:22] but god who was in christ who was in
[1:22:25] jesus christ
[1:22:26] did not have a beginning and he will
[1:22:28] never have an
[1:22:30] end okay are you following me now
[1:22:32] because jesus was a son
[1:22:34] he was begotten and i want us to look at
[1:22:36] that as well
[1:22:38] okay so uh the word begotten okay let us
[1:22:41] first read
[1:22:43] genesis chapter five
[1:22:46] genesis chapter five verse three to four
[1:22:51] and adam lived 130 years and begot a son
[1:22:55] in
[1:22:55] his own likeness after his image and
[1:22:58] afghani
[1:22:59] and he called his name seth and the days
[1:23:01] of adam after
[1:23:02] and the days of adam after it began
[1:23:04] saith we are 800 years
[1:23:06] and and he began sons and daughters and
[1:23:09] the word was made
[1:23:11] all right now uh before we get into john
[1:23:13] 1
[1:23:14] let us look at that for just a moment
[1:23:16] okay
[1:23:17] verse 3 can you give me verse 3 brother
[1:23:20] yes
[1:23:20] up there all right now he says uh
[1:23:24] are you in genesis 3 i'm in genesis 5
[1:23:28] i do not know what is wrong with my

[1:25:46] jesus christ
[1:25:47] and where you would be like seeing
[1:25:49] you'll never see that he's the second
[1:25:50] god anymore
[1:25:51] you will only see that he's a son of god
[1:25:53] and the son of god means god in flesh
[1:25:55] not another god but the god the very god
[1:25:57] the jehovah god putting on flesh
[1:26:00] okay read that again for us verse 14
[1:26:03] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:26:06] among
[1:26:07] us and we beheld his glory remember who
[1:26:10] is the word
[1:26:12] jesus christ right you want to give us
[1:26:14] verse one
[1:26:15] verse one go quickly quickly quickly
[1:26:18] quickly to verse one
[1:26:20] okay verse one says
[1:26:23] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:26:26] word
[1:26:27] was with god and the word right there
[1:26:29] and the word was
[1:26:30] god the word in the beginning was the
[1:26:33] word and the word was with god and the
[1:26:34] word was
[1:26:35] god verse two the same was in the
[1:26:37] beginning with
[1:26:39] god now if we're able to just scroll
[1:26:42] quickly and let's go back to
[1:26:43] verse 14. it says that uh in the
[1:26:46] beginning
[1:26:47] was the word and the word was with god
[1:26:49] and the word was
[1:26:50] god the same was in the beginning with
[1:26:52] who okay but now verse 14 says
[1:26:55] remember the word who was what god so
[1:26:57] now this god
[1:26:59] are you following me sisters yes
[1:27:00] brothers everybody and
[1:27:02] and the word now can we not put god
[1:27:05] there can we read it together
[1:27:06] and god was made flesh
[1:27:10] you see now so we have here god and we
[1:27:13] have the flesh
[1:27:14] okay but it is the same person right
[1:27:18] but here he's changing a form and god
[1:27:21] was made flesh and he dwelt among us and
[1:27:24] we beheld his glory
[1:27:26] the glory as the only you see of the
[1:27:29] only begotten can you can you click for
[1:27:31] me the word begotten there
[1:27:33] begotten of the father so he was now a
[1:27:35] son he was now
[1:27:36] a begotten son uh a begotten
[1:27:39] son okay i do not know why sister peace
[1:27:42] is saying that uh
[1:27:45] she cannot hear can everybody else here
[1:27:50] sister can you hear me okay so sister
[1:27:52] peace
[1:27:53] it might be your connection that has a
[1:27:54] problem okay
[1:27:56] all right now uh the word begotten there
[1:28:00] takes us to it says only begotten click
[1:28:03] down
[1:28:03] only only child single of its kind only
[1:28:07] used of only sons
[1:28:08] or daughters so it still points to the
[1:28:11] the other word
[1:28:13] of bringing forth child
[1:28:16] okay let's read one last one here verse
[1:28:18] 18
[1:28:21] verse 18 no man
[1:28:24] has seen god at any time the only
[1:28:27] begotten
[1:28:28] son which is in the bosom of the father
[1:28:31] he has declared him and we can have
[1:28:33] very many verses for you which speaks of
[1:28:35] jesus as the begotten son
[1:28:37] begotten son a son which was brought
[1:28:39] forth okay
[1:28:40] a son which was born a sandwich but now
[1:28:43] in this case who is his father
[1:28:45] god now the question is when we say that
[1:28:48] abraham begot children how did he beget
[1:28:51] children
[1:28:52] the way abraham begets is not the way
[1:28:55] god begins
[1:28:57] the way abraham begets is through
[1:29:01] intercourse but the way god begins
[1:29:05] his first son that he begot was adam
[1:29:09] can you type in first adam second adam
[1:29:11] then you give us that quote as well
[1:29:13] the way that that uh god begets he
[1:29:16] doesn't beget
[1:29:17] should be got the the gay children he
[1:29:20] doesn't bring forth children
[1:29:22] like we do today that's why we are born
[1:29:24] in sin because of the way we were
[1:29:25] begotten
[1:29:26] okay but the way god begets children is
[1:29:29] through our
[1:29:30] spoken one and that's why when adam was
[1:29:34] brought forth adam was a
[1:29:35] son of god but what happened with adam
[1:29:38] he sinned and he died so therefore he
[1:29:39] needed to be kind of redeemed
[1:29:42] and for god to redeem him he had to come
[1:29:45] as as not
[1:29:49] no come on right first adam
[1:29:53] no no i just do not want you to go into
[1:29:55] the greek lexicon i just want you to go
[1:29:57] to the verse
[1:29:59] such a bible vasco and then you just
[1:30:00] type in for me first adam
[1:30:02] you'll get that quickly i think it's in
[1:30:03] 18 corinthians okay let me give you a
[1:30:06] bible verse
[1:30:11] first corinthians chapter 15 verse 45.
[1:30:15] quickly now it says
[1:30:18] can you get there if you have a pen and
[1:30:20] paper you can write it down
[1:30:22] i hope you're taking notes on on this
[1:30:24] subject
[1:30:25] and so it is written the first man adam
[1:30:29] was made a living soul and the last
[1:30:32] adam was made awakening
[1:30:35] spirit howbeit that we
[1:30:39] albeit that was not fast which is
[1:30:42] spiritual but that which is natural
[1:30:43] and afterward that which is spiritual
[1:30:46] the first man is of the art athe who is
[1:30:48] that
[1:30:49] adam right the second man you see
[1:30:52] the other one was the first man and now
[1:30:54] this one also is the second man where is
[1:30:55] it
[1:30:56] see the first man and this is the
[1:31:01] second man he is the lord
[1:31:05] from heaven oh you people are not
[1:31:09] following me are you
[1:31:12] verse 47 the first man is off
[1:31:16] the earth athe the second man
[1:31:20] is the lord from from heaven
[1:31:24] as is the atheist such as they also that
[1:31:27] are happy
[1:31:28] and as is the heavenly such are they
[1:31:30] also that are
[1:31:32] heavenly of course if you are born
[1:31:35] according to the
[1:31:36] nature of the natural man you will be
[1:31:40] natural or acting like the natural man
[1:31:41] adam if you are born in a sinful nation
[1:31:44] the way we are born you will be
[1:31:45] sinful that's why we have to be born
[1:31:47] again according to the nature of the one
[1:31:49] who
[1:31:49] is not sinful who is the lord of heaven
[1:31:52] he says the second man he calls him a
[1:31:54] man but he says the word
[1:31:56] the lord from heaven so he has this part
[1:31:58] of a man
[1:31:59] and he has the other part of the lord so
[1:32:02] he is a golden man that's why in a video
[1:32:04] we met there i called him a god man
[1:32:07] a prophet god a god prophet you
[1:32:09] understand
[1:32:10] he was both he was a man a hundred
[1:32:13] percent but he was god
[1:32:14] also a hundred percent he was adam
[1:32:18] and that's why the bible says he was
[1:32:19] this only begotten son because the first
[1:32:22] one sinned and never fought
[1:32:23] so jesus christ was the only begotten
[1:32:26] son
[1:32:26] begotten meaning he was brought forth
[1:32:29] how did god bring him forth can someone
[1:32:31] tell him
[1:32:34] god bless you by the spoken one you know
[1:32:37] god
[1:32:37] gets begets his children by uh by their
[1:32:41] spoken word and therefore i think i
[1:32:44] don't know how we can help
[1:32:46] uh sister uh there's a sister who is
[1:32:49] saying
[1:32:50] she cannot hear us and for some reason
[1:32:54] i do not know how to to to help her
[1:32:58] okay all right right here okay
[1:33:01] so now uh the
[1:33:06] what was my point
[1:33:10] yes adam how did you how did god beget
[1:33:12] adam
[1:33:15] do you even know how adam was born
[1:33:19] come on god more than he
[1:33:23] that's a good answer but that's genesis
[1:33:25] chapter
[1:33:26] chapter chapter 2
[1:33:30] but what happened in chapter 1.
[1:33:36] can do you have a bible can you go to
[1:33:39] genesis chapter one
[1:33:40] everybody
[1:33:44] genesis chapter one
[1:33:48] genesis chapter 1.
[1:33:55] verse 26 i'm waiting for the verse here
[1:33:59] for the
[1:33:59] for the scripture here can you read
[1:34:03] somebody
[1:34:06] let us make man in our images
[1:34:21] [Music]
[1:34:29] verse 27 so god created man
[1:34:32] in his own image in the image of both
[1:34:35] practice in him
[1:34:36] male and kingdom prejudice praise the
[1:34:39] name of the lord
[1:34:41] so god created man in whose image in
[1:34:46] in his image ah you just put it off
[1:34:49] come on i think you should let this
[1:34:51] thing be yeah so that
[1:34:53] where's the remote you can use the
[1:34:54] remote instead of just skipping on and
[1:34:56] off right
[1:34:57] now it says that uh and so
[1:35:00] god made money in his own image the
[1:35:03] image of god requested he he male
[1:35:04] and female created ye them brother
[1:35:09] buddy do you see anything like molding
[1:35:12] here
[1:35:14] so what happened go to verse 26
[1:35:17] and tell me what happened because you
[1:35:18] said god more than man so what happened
[1:35:20] verse 27
[1:35:21] and god and god
[1:35:26] no come on read it and god and god
[1:35:31] don't rush and god
[1:35:34] did you hear that that's all i wanted
[1:35:35] you to see and god
[1:35:37] said then verse 27
[1:35:42] after god's saying what happened so come
[1:35:45] on read with me
[1:35:46] god created
[1:35:49] man in his own image so now was this man
[1:35:53] created mode so what happened here
[1:36:00] god said god spoke man into existence
[1:36:04] and was this a man with bones and flesh
[1:36:09] no he was a spirit man
[1:36:12] like god is a spirit man so god created
[1:36:15] man before he ever molded him
[1:36:20] now when you go to verse 2 chapter 2
[1:36:22] rather sorry
[1:36:24] go to chapter two everybody and now you
[1:36:27] can read
[1:36:28] from verses um uh where is that
[1:36:36] okay yes verse 7
[1:36:41] and and the lord god read with me now
[1:36:45] formed man of the dust of the crown
[1:36:48] and breathed into his nostrils the
[1:36:49] breath of life and man became a leaving
[1:36:53] soul and when you come in second
[1:36:54] corinthians where we're reading he said
[1:36:56] that god made the first man happy but
[1:36:58] this the second man
[1:37:00] the lord from heaven the first man he
[1:37:02] made him a living soul
[1:37:03] but the second man he made him a
[1:37:05] quickening spirit you know what a
[1:37:06] preparing spirit is
[1:37:08] a quickening spirit is a spirit which
[1:37:10] gives life
[1:37:13] so the second man adam was a quickening
[1:37:16] spirit
[1:37:16] but the first man adam was a living
[1:37:20] soul so jesus you cannot call him a soul
[1:37:24] okay but jesus was god that's why we do
[1:37:27] not call him a man but we call him god
[1:37:29] because jesus was a quickening
[1:37:32] spirit but yet he was a man and that's
[1:37:35] what confuses the people
[1:37:36] how could he be a man and a quickening
[1:37:39] spirit at the same time
[1:37:41] that is the simplicity of god he
[1:37:45] reveals himself in humility or in
[1:37:48] simplicity
[1:37:49] he hides himself in simplicity and he
[1:37:51] reveals himself in simplicity now you
[1:37:53] may ask
[1:37:54] you may ask me how does genesis connect
[1:37:57] now with what we are looking at because
[1:37:58] in genesis
[1:37:59] it shows us that man was created fast
[1:38:03] by the words and then later he was
[1:38:06] molded
[1:38:06] okay so the molding was really the
[1:38:09] manifestation of that which was already
[1:38:11] created because he never did create
[1:38:13] again
[1:38:13] he only breathed into him into his
[1:38:16] nostrils
[1:38:17] and then he became a living soul so now
[1:38:19] buddy before god
[1:38:22] ever formed anything uh rather ever
[1:38:25] formed man
[1:38:26] molded him he created him and before god
[1:38:29] before
[1:38:30] anything happened before anything
[1:38:31] manifests
[1:38:33] god spoke it fast into existence
[1:38:36] god is one is equal to
[1:38:39] its fulfillment whatever he speaks he
[1:38:42] fulfills it before
[1:38:44] he fulfills it before it actually
[1:38:48] happens
[1:38:49] he speaks and his word is as good as
[1:38:53] done so now let's go back to our point
[1:38:57] we are looking at a god
[1:39:01] the creator of heaven and earth the
[1:39:03] eternal god
[1:39:05] and he spoke man into existence and man
[1:39:07] was adam
[1:39:08] and in the same way spoke man to into
[1:39:10] existence in john 1
[1:39:11] it says underworld remember the word
[1:39:13] which was not spoken right
[1:39:15] became this time
[1:39:18] it became flesh where where
[1:39:22] in the flesh of jesus in on earth in the
[1:39:26] body of a man
[1:39:27] called jesus that was the word
[1:39:30] that was god who had become
[1:39:33] flesh but now do not confuse do not say
[1:39:37] that oh
[1:39:38] jesus was the father and the son and the
[1:39:40] holy spirit
[1:39:42] jesus was the son of god a manifestation
[1:39:45] of god
[1:39:46] god has manifested himself as the father
[1:39:48] in the old testament and as a son
[1:39:50] in the new testament through jesus
[1:39:51] christ the son of god
[1:39:53] but he has also manifested himself today
[1:39:55] in us
[1:39:57] in the form of the holy spirit but the
[1:40:00] name of jesus christ is the name which
[1:40:01] is above every name
[1:40:03] and that name has manifested the name of
[1:40:05] the father the name of the son
[1:40:07] and the name of them the holy spirit so
[1:40:11] that's why when we say the lord jesus
[1:40:12] christ we mean father son and holy
[1:40:14] spirit
[1:40:15] but jesus as a man here on earth he
[1:40:19] was the only begotten do you have that
[1:40:21] one
[1:40:22] how was he begotten now can someone
[1:40:24] answer that
[1:40:28] how was he begotten to who
[1:40:33] to mary he told what mary says the peace
[1:40:37] what did god tell mary
[1:40:38] since you're a sister you may remember
[1:40:39] that very well what
[1:40:41] what did god tell mary when he came to
[1:40:43] mary through gabriel in judah
[1:40:45] do you remember that you have forgotten
[1:40:49] buddy can you help him can you help her
[1:40:58] yes it says you are blessed among
[1:41:01] women okay that you will be you'll bear
[1:41:05] a son and you shall call his name
[1:41:07] jesus so now you can see that word
[1:41:09] medicine
[1:41:11] how will these things be i am only a
[1:41:13] virgin and then what did she
[1:41:15] what did the angel answer
[1:41:18] you say
[1:41:21] he said that the holy spirit will over
[1:41:24] shadow thee and you will have a son
[1:41:27] now she said what did she say after that
[1:41:30] be it unto me
[1:41:32] come on now amen
[1:41:36] people get into yes yes she said amen
[1:41:38] but what what
[1:41:39] there's something i want from the bible
[1:41:40] there she said be it to me
[1:41:44] come on people yes
[1:41:50] come on get get the scripture don't
[1:41:52] don't get out your thoughts
[1:41:55] she said be it unto me because you see
[1:41:57] these are the things that
[1:41:58] you take for granted and then you
[1:42:00] realize you don't know them
[1:42:02] you know so once one scripture can
[1:42:04] change your entire thought of the bible
[1:42:09] it's in the book of matthew
[1:42:14] let me get it
[1:42:19] okay we can look look it up here in the
[1:42:22] gospels you can look it up but um
[1:42:25] at look just uh look at luke chapter 1
[1:42:29] verse 38
[1:42:32] okay can you read now but from verse 7
[1:42:35] for with god nothing shall be impossible
[1:42:37] and mary shall mary said behold the
[1:42:40] handmaid of the lord
[1:42:43] be it unto me according
[1:42:46] to according
[1:42:50] it is just right there yo come on
[1:42:54] can you go back up he says bear it unto
[1:42:57] me
[1:42:58] according to thy word and the angel
[1:43:00] departed
[1:43:02] did you see what she said can you read
[1:43:04] that do it again beat it unto me
[1:43:06] all of us together one two three go
[1:43:10] [Music]
[1:43:12] according to thy what i wanted to
[1:43:15] emphasize that thing
[1:43:17] according to thy word how was jesus a
[1:43:20] begotten son
[1:43:23] by the spoken word of god
[1:43:27] he spoke the word and the word created
[1:43:29] now here is the interesting part
[1:43:32] the word created both the egg
[1:43:35] and the seed did you ever know that no
[1:43:40] because mary naturally she would have to
[1:43:44] get a husband
[1:43:45] you know the husband provides seed and
[1:43:47] the woman provides egg
[1:43:49] most of you are in school you know that
[1:43:50] right but in this case god outer
[1:43:54] outer the way of man he outed it
[1:43:56] completely
[1:43:57] and therefore he doesn't need a seed for
[1:43:59] man he doesn't need
[1:44:01] egg from woman he only needs a womb
[1:44:05] from the woman because remember once the
[1:44:08] seed
[1:44:09] fertilizes the egg then on down it goes
[1:44:13] into
[1:44:13] the womb not so but in this case
[1:44:17] god canceled the other part of the
[1:44:19] fertilization
[1:44:21] of the of the seed of the man and there
[1:44:25] yeah he canceled all that kind of thing
[1:44:28] and what he instead did
[1:44:30] he came himself and created the egg
[1:44:34] and he created the seed are you
[1:44:36] following me
[1:44:37] and then he he
[1:44:40] used his word his word to create both
[1:44:44] put it together and then a life
[1:44:47] was formed in the womb of mary the next
[1:44:50] time
[1:44:50] mary realizes is a child is growing in a
[1:44:54] womb
[1:44:55] what was that it was the spoken word
[1:44:59] of god therefore jesus was the only
[1:45:03] begotten son of god
[1:45:07] because it means what brought forth
[1:45:10] begotten means what a child born or
[1:45:13] brought
[1:45:14] forth so jesus was brought forth by how
[1:45:16] how does god
[1:45:17] bring his father's children by the
[1:45:19] spoken one
[1:45:20] even today if you want to be born again
[1:45:23] you can only be born again by the way
[1:45:26] that's why we take this time to get into
[1:45:28] the bible into the message to learn it
[1:45:30] to know
[1:45:31] so that you can also be born again one
[1:45:32] day when you're here let me tell you
[1:45:34] don't worry if now it's not really
[1:45:35] making a lot of sense to you it's all
[1:45:36] right just keep on keeping on
[1:45:39] one day when you are hearing you'll just
[1:45:42] understand the older side
[1:45:44] what was wrong with me for all those
[1:45:45] years now i see you to clear it
[1:45:47] you see what has happened you have just
[1:45:48] been born into the kingdom you see
[1:45:51] we too can only be born by the watch you
[1:45:54] see we just have to keep under but the
[1:45:55] balance says that you keep under the
[1:45:57] altar
[1:45:57] uh revelation is striking after
[1:45:59] revelation striking after revelations
[1:46:01] right
[1:46:02] you see and then immediately without
[1:46:05] even
[1:46:05] you know preparing for it there it will
[1:46:07] be it will come
[1:46:08] the holy ghost the life of christ
[1:46:10] himself now you also be a begotten son
[1:46:12] how by the way you see by the way that's
[1:46:15] why
[1:46:16] let me tell you in this process in this
[1:46:17] i don't know if you have 31 days or more
[1:46:19] but
[1:46:20] something will happen someone will be
[1:46:21] devoted
[1:46:23] praise the name of the lord and so
[1:46:25] that's how jesus was a begotten son
[1:46:27] and when we said that jesus was not
[1:46:29] eternal son we mean he was begotten also
[1:46:32] like all of us have to god
[1:46:33] yeah he will have an end but listen he
[1:46:36] that was in him
[1:46:37] is god the almighty and he had no
[1:46:39] beginning and he will have no
[1:46:42] and and therefore he is
[1:46:45] god and he alone is god actually
[1:46:48] in the video which we recorded i took
[1:46:50] even time to explain
[1:46:52] the the three of the god is going to use
[1:46:55] this sun
[1:46:56] in three offices does anyone know them
[1:46:59] yes one
[1:47:03] father son holy spirit nope nope father
[1:47:06] son holy spirit is god right but now
[1:47:09] as a son god as a son
[1:47:13] he has manifested himself in three ways
[1:47:16] also
[1:47:18] in three times three officers three
[1:47:21] dispensations
[1:47:22] doing different things other son
[1:47:26] as a savior who is he son of a who
[1:47:30] son of man
[1:47:33] yes you are bringing something
[1:47:40] you see these are the things you need to
[1:47:42] know in the message
[1:47:43] son of man son of
[1:47:47] god son of david when does son of man
[1:47:51] start
[1:47:56] sorry
[1:47:59] his ministry when does the ministry of
[1:48:02] son of man take place
[1:48:05] no no no not years not years i mean what
[1:48:07] did he do
[1:48:08] in that ministry and son of man
[1:48:13] can you refer to jesus now the son of
[1:48:14] man oh to the son of man
[1:48:18] in prayer we always say son of god right
[1:48:22] oh son of god that mercy on me oh you
[1:48:25] know
[1:48:25] because now a son of god is a spirit
[1:48:27] right he says the holy spirit is son of
[1:48:29] god
[1:48:30] but son of man he was a prophet he was a
[1:48:32] man on earth
[1:48:34] even ezekiel was called son of man son
[1:48:36] of mine is a prophet usually
[1:48:37] so when we say son of man we mean a
[1:48:39] prophet and jesus was a prophet from the
[1:48:41] time he started his ministry to the time
[1:48:44] when he went on the cross
[1:48:46] he finished that minister of son of man
[1:48:48] and now he is continuing
[1:48:49] from pentecost until the rapture he is
[1:48:51] in the ministry of son of
[1:48:53] son of god and we are waiting for the
[1:48:55] ministry now of
[1:48:56] son of david but did you know
[1:49:00] according to the scripture in i think
[1:49:02] luke 17 30
[1:49:04] if i'm not mistaken the bible promises
[1:49:07] there will be
[1:49:07] another manifestation of the ministry of
[1:49:10] son of man again
[1:49:13] between son of god and son of david
[1:49:18] okay is that so deep can i can we go
[1:49:20] into that a little bit
[1:49:23] now someone wants to say something on it
[1:49:24] first before we go
[1:49:26] into come on now
[1:49:30] no one yes no
[1:49:35] son of god yes you want to say something
[1:49:36] all right you can
[1:49:41] sorry son of god yes we are now in the
[1:49:44] son of god this translation
[1:49:48] for the jews thank you son of man
[1:49:55] but he has already manifested himself as
[1:49:57] son of man for the jews
[1:49:59] yes he he he
[1:50:02] jesus when he was on earth he came in as
[1:50:06] as what did he do as a son of man you
[1:50:09] need to first understand
[1:50:10] the ministry of jesus as the son of man
[1:50:12] yes
[1:50:15] you want to take them so because that
[1:50:17] the others can also join you
[1:50:18] no you can't go come on go ahead go
[1:50:21] ahead
[1:50:25] no problem you can't even stay there all
[1:50:28] right
[1:50:28] yes you want to contribute something
[1:50:36] okay
[1:50:51] okay yes right and son of mine he was
[1:50:54] like after being born four years
[1:50:58] later of course they killed his father
[1:51:02] calling the disciples then
[1:51:19] read that okay now
[1:51:22] that's correct yes as the son of man he
[1:51:24] did all that
[1:51:26] but you also have to remember that
[1:51:30] jesus christ as a
[1:51:33] a son of man
[1:51:37] he had a particular work to do a
[1:51:40] particular work to do
[1:51:41] do you understand that
[1:51:45] his major purpose was to die on the
[1:51:47] cross as a son of man
[1:51:50] that was his major purpose but he also
[1:51:52] manifested himself
[1:51:55] in as a like you said as a healer
[1:51:59] as a deliverer as a savior you know did
[1:52:02] many things while he was on earth
[1:52:04] before his death but one of those
[1:52:07] that manifesto showed his ministry come
[1:52:10] on you should know this
[1:52:11] he manifested it one time to a woman and
[1:52:14] she ran to the city and said
[1:52:16] come see a man who has told me
[1:52:19] everything of that he said this the very
[1:52:21] messiah
[1:52:23] what told her that that's the messiah
[1:52:30] but who was that woman first of all let
[1:52:31] us remember how fast
[1:52:33] this is a marijuana woman and what did
[1:52:36] this
[1:52:36] woman do
[1:52:40] well of course she had she was a
[1:52:42] prostitute kind of okay she had many
[1:52:44] men and she lived her life and then and
[1:52:47] then eventually
[1:52:48] she she meets this man jesus christ
[1:52:52] that told her that she had lived with
[1:52:54] six uh
[1:52:55] six men rather six five men
[1:52:58] yes and that even the sixth that he was
[1:53:00] with was not
[1:53:02] uh a husband what was jesus trying to
[1:53:06] say he was saying you've been with five
[1:53:08] men
[1:53:09] even the six even the sixth right now is
[1:53:12] not yours
[1:53:13] in other words to mean i am the man now
[1:53:17] the seventh
[1:53:18] i am the one who has come to you
[1:53:21] indirectly jesus was trying to announce
[1:53:23] him
[1:53:24] his arrival i am the messiah i am the
[1:53:27] man who has promised to come
[1:53:28] i am he like it all those people if you
[1:53:30] do not believe
[1:53:31] that i am he you will do what die in
[1:53:34] your sins
[1:53:36] and here jesus begins to talk to that
[1:53:38] woman and the woman
[1:53:40] you know jesus did not announce himself
[1:53:42] of course like that but i'm telling you
[1:53:43] what he was trying to do by what he did
[1:53:45] you understand that
[1:53:46] so now after he you know asked her those
[1:53:49] questions and
[1:53:50] you know everything that the woman you
[1:53:53] know what when jesus said
[1:53:55] give me water she's she was like ah
[1:53:58] first we have some matters there's a
[1:53:59] question about somebody
[1:54:00] confused i will deal with that in our
[1:54:02] next meeting i say
[1:54:03] afros we are surmising what do we have
[1:54:05] to do with you you know we don't like
[1:54:06] you you don't like us so
[1:54:08] what what is it huh and you know of
[1:54:09] course even the time she had to come at
[1:54:11] the well it was not a good time
[1:54:12] certainly it shows you know in israel
[1:54:15] there are women that are
[1:54:16] unknown the good ones go in the morning
[1:54:19] and the bad ones go at the time when
[1:54:21] the sun is so hot right so this one was
[1:54:24] a bad one you just knew that she was
[1:54:25] going to beat her
[1:54:26] so now by the time that she just met her
[1:54:29] she was like
[1:54:31] you know like a kind of thing so by the
[1:54:34] end of the conversation jesus said
[1:54:37] if you knew she said if you knew
[1:54:42] what kind of a man was that was asking
[1:54:44] you to give him
[1:54:45] water you would know that the water i
[1:54:48] would
[1:54:49] give you if you drink it
[1:54:53] you will not fast again
[1:54:57] go fetch me your husband i have none i
[1:54:59] have none leave me alone
[1:55:01] say yes you spoke well you don't have
[1:55:03] any you have been having five and now
[1:55:04] you are even living with the sick but
[1:55:06] even this
[1:55:06] is not yours
[1:55:09] he said what he said what was in her
[1:55:12] heart her heart was cut to pieces
[1:55:14] and she remembered because samaritans
[1:55:16] and the jews
[1:55:18] knew the prophecy of the coming of the
[1:55:20] messiah and what the messiah would
[1:55:22] do because the messiah would be the son
[1:55:25] of man you understand
[1:55:26] so now when her heart was discerned you
[1:55:29] remember that the only one that was can
[1:55:31] be able to design your heart and tell
[1:55:33] your name
[1:55:33] what you have done and everything in
[1:55:35] your heart not in your mind but in your
[1:55:37] heart we are not talking about the gift
[1:55:40] let me
[1:55:40] let me bring this to the end now because
[1:55:42] i need you to understand this you will
[1:55:43] now
[1:55:44] eventually help you to understand this
[1:55:45] message in a better way look
[1:55:48] we are not talking about then one of the
[1:55:50] gifts in the nine
[1:55:51] spiritual gifts because there are nine
[1:55:53] spiritual gifts and one of them is
[1:55:55] the discernment of the spirit of the
[1:55:58] people right
[1:56:00] you you know you know you you see
[1:56:02] prophets many times you spend the
[1:56:03] pentecost
[1:56:04] i see in my spirit and i begin training
[1:56:06] it right
[1:56:07] so now we're not talking about that kind
[1:56:10] of gift
[1:56:10] we are talking about the sign of the
[1:56:13] messiah
[1:56:15] what is the sign of the messiah please
[1:56:17] follow here the sign of the messiah
[1:56:19] follow follow this thought now
[1:56:20] the sign of the messiah is that
[1:56:23] which shows the characteristics of the
[1:56:27] characters
[1:56:28] and the nature of god himself when do we
[1:56:31] see it first
[1:56:32] we see it with melchizedek you remember
[1:56:35] that
[1:56:37] you remember how mere kisses they came
[1:56:38] to abraham
[1:56:40] and he told him that you are going to
[1:56:42] get a son after according to the time of
[1:56:44] life you know next year
[1:56:45] and and and the sarah was in the tent
[1:56:50] and it was in our heart not outside
[1:56:54] but merry christmas the tent was behind
[1:56:57] him
[1:56:58] but he was able to hear that and he said
[1:57:00] hmm
[1:57:01] abraham said why did you sad your wife
[1:57:02] laugh
[1:57:04] and santa had that she said ah i did
[1:57:06] laugh did you hear me laughing
[1:57:08] but then she laughed she laughed in her
[1:57:10] heart so she expected no one would know
[1:57:11] that she laughed
[1:57:13] now who was that that would be able to
[1:57:15] tell
[1:57:16] or sarah what she has done in her heart
[1:57:18] who was that that would be able to call
[1:57:20] sarah by sarah no sarai
[1:57:22] abram by abraham not abraham who was
[1:57:25] that that knew their names their new
[1:57:27] names
[1:57:27] that knew what they had done and knew
[1:57:29] what they were expecting from the lord
[1:57:31] it was god himself right yes and that
[1:57:33] was the first time he manifested that
[1:57:36] sign that messianic sign but we don't
[1:57:38] see it again
[1:57:39] until jesus came and he was born and
[1:57:41] when he was born
[1:57:42] he manifest that among other jews
[1:57:46] he called nathanael he told him where he
[1:57:48] was you remember that
[1:57:49] he called who was who is the call a
[1:57:51] peter he told him that he was son of
[1:57:53] jonas
[1:57:54] he called you remember and then
[1:57:55] eventually he meets the samaritan woman
[1:57:58] and with the samaritan woman is very
[1:58:00] very clear he tells her everything
[1:58:02] this woman was like this is this messiah
[1:58:05] we were waiting for
[1:58:06] he's the one he must be the one children
[1:58:09] and
[1:58:09] she went to the city she's gonna say you
[1:58:11] people come and sit for your setups
[1:58:13] come and see and here was her statement
[1:58:15] she wasn't too sure but she was sure by
[1:58:17] herself but she wasn't she wouldn't
[1:58:19] judge for them right
[1:58:20] so she told them come and see this man
[1:58:23] who has told me
[1:58:24] everything i've done he said this
[1:58:27] the very messiah you understand
[1:58:32] why was she suspecting that this could
[1:58:34] be the messiah show of hands
[1:58:38] yes yes
[1:58:44] yes yes
[1:58:47] yes that's the same thing but everybody
[1:58:50] could speak that so what's special about
[1:58:52] it yes
[1:58:55] god bless you as the as i was waiting
[1:58:57] for she
[1:58:59] this woman rather this jesus
[1:59:02] did what was expected of the messiah to
[1:59:05] do when
[1:59:06] he should come
[1:59:09] so she went and told them come and say
[1:59:11] isn't this the messiah
[1:59:12] you know when someone tells you when
[1:59:14] when uh when ocaro comes
[1:59:16] he will be you know like this and he
[1:59:17] will tell you this way so when he comes
[1:59:19] and he tells exactly and he
[1:59:20] looks the same way you'll be like come
[1:59:22] and see this okay you understand you've
[1:59:24] never seen okay
[1:59:25] you don't know keller but because you
[1:59:26] know what a color would do and you know
[1:59:28] how it would look
[1:59:28] when it comes you will surely be able to
[1:59:31] tell you understand
[1:59:32] and these people came running and when
[1:59:35] they arrived
[1:59:36] there they saw the woman they saw jesus
[1:59:40] they looked at the woman they said you
[1:59:41] woman we have believed
[1:59:45] but not because you did what not because
[1:59:47] you told us but because we have seen
[1:59:49] with our very eyes and we have had by
[1:59:51] our
[1:59:52] own ears they saw also and they
[1:59:54] confirmed that he was the word
[1:59:57] now do you know that jesus revealed
[1:59:59] himself as the messiah among the jews
[2:00:01] and the gentiles
[2:00:03] but he never revealed himself as the
[2:00:04] messiah among the
[2:00:06] i mean among the jews and the samaritans
[2:00:08] but he never revealed himself as the
[2:00:09] messiah among the gentiles
[2:00:12] does anyone know why he never did reveal
[2:00:15] himself among the gentiles at that time
[2:00:17] show of hands yes
[2:00:23] but he did work with the samaritans he
[2:00:25] revealed himself to the samaritans
[2:00:28] so yes that's correct but not entirely
[2:00:30] correct yes
[2:00:34] look people the jews were expecting him
[2:00:37] not sir
[2:00:38] the generals were they the samaritans
[2:00:40] were expecting him not so
[2:00:42] not so did the genders even know about
[2:00:46] anything about the jesus the messiah
[2:00:49] did they so where are we expecting him
[2:00:52] no because our great great fathers were
[2:00:54] not expecting him they didn't even know
[2:00:55] anything about that
[2:00:57] they had never read the books so how
[2:00:59] could they expect someone they don't
[2:01:00] know
[2:01:01] so jesus had to wait for more than 2
[2:01:04] 000 years and the genders know him very
[2:01:07] well
[2:01:08] and then he will come and also reveal
[2:01:10] himself among them
[2:01:13] and there is a prophecy on that can we
[2:01:15] read it
[2:01:16] yes all right and then i will tell you
[2:01:19] what has happened now generation
[2:01:27] okay go to the book of
[2:01:31] luke give it to me here on the screen
[2:01:39] luke luke chapter
[2:01:52] chapter 17
[2:02:00] do you have it chapter 17 verse 24.
[2:02:14] okay it's right there
[2:02:21] okay for us the lightening that lightens
[2:02:23] out
[2:02:24] of the one part under heaven shines
[2:02:26] under the other part under heaven so
[2:02:28] shall also the son of man be in his dna
[2:02:30] he's talking about who
[2:02:32] the son of man are you following
[2:02:34] actually following yes he's talking
[2:02:36] about
[2:02:36] the son of man right okay verse 25
[2:02:39] please let us follow on we are about to
[2:02:40] finish okay
[2:02:41] but first master he suffer many things
[2:02:44] and be rejected of his
[2:02:45] generation of this generation and as it
[2:02:47] was
[2:02:48] and as it was in the days of who
[2:02:52] as it was aware
[2:02:55] so shall it be also
[2:03:01] in the days of the son
[2:03:04] of man continue
[2:03:07] what happened in days of noah
[2:03:13] they were given a marriage until the day
[2:03:15] that noah entered into the ark and the
[2:03:17] flood came and destroyed them all now
[2:03:19] hey
[2:03:22] please can you can you sit down
[2:03:25] now friends i want you to hear this
[2:03:29] can we can you agree with me if i say
[2:03:32] that
[2:03:32] the days of noah where was the end time
[2:03:37] of that generation and actually of the
[2:03:39] whole world
[2:03:40] can you agree with me come on some of
[2:03:44] you don't agree
[2:03:45] why do you agree that it was the end
[2:03:54] times
[2:03:59] only that because people even people die
[2:04:01] today
[2:04:04] everyone yes okay that's a significant
[2:04:06] point but here was the reason why it was
[2:04:08] the end time
[2:04:09] one there was a man that god sent
[2:04:12] with a message specifically to that
[2:04:15] generation
[2:04:15] and that they were supposed to accept
[2:04:17] that message of perish right
[2:04:19] that that qualifies it to be an end time
[2:04:21] because before
[2:04:22] god does anything in the world according
[2:04:24] to the book of amos
[2:04:26] chapter 3 verse 27
[2:04:29] surely the lord god will do nothing
[2:04:33] but but he revealed his secrets these
[2:04:36] scriptures you should
[2:04:37] read write and then read later but the
[2:04:39] reveal is seconds to who
[2:04:41] to his servants the prophets in other
[2:04:44] words
[2:04:44] before anything major happens in this
[2:04:46] world god first
[2:04:48] reveals it to his servants the prophets
[2:04:52] after he uh he reveals it then it
[2:04:56] happens
[2:04:56] you understand so we see also in the
[2:04:59] days
[2:05:00] of jesus uh
[2:05:03] in the in the days of noah rather he
[2:05:07] had said it would rain did it rain
[2:05:12] yes sister peace what happened the days
[2:05:15] of noah
[2:05:17] it rained and what happened after dre
[2:05:27] yes and those who did not enter what
[2:05:29] happened
[2:05:30] they died so in other words uh
[2:05:33] if if people today
[2:05:36] do not accept the message of today
[2:05:40] like in the days of noah they will
[2:05:43] perish
[2:05:43] like the people of noah perished but the
[2:05:46] only difference is
[2:05:47] the days of noah they perished with by
[2:05:50] water
[2:05:51] but today they are not perished by
[2:05:52] whether they will perish by fire
[2:05:54] can you imagine can you imagine people
[2:05:57] how serious must we be when we know that
[2:05:58] there is a message in our land
[2:06:00] like it was in the days of no
[2:06:03] you now see how serious this is getting
[2:06:06] so i want to come
[2:06:06] conclude with this and and i'll just
[2:06:09] summarize if
[2:06:10] someone wants to do something and the
[2:06:11] rest of the questions will deal with
[2:06:12] them the next time
[2:06:13] okay now for us the lightening okay we
[2:06:17] are continuing with that verse
[2:06:20] we are continuing with that verse
[2:06:23] we are continuing with that verse luke
[2:06:26] 17 24 you you must be following
[2:06:28] very very closely okay listen to this
[2:06:31] for us the lightening that lightens out
[2:06:33] of the
[2:06:34] one part under the heavens shining under
[2:06:37] the other part
[2:06:38] okay we were already down there on verse
[2:06:40] 28. likewise also as it was in the days
[2:06:43] of lord they did eat they drunk they
[2:06:45] bought they sold they planted they built
[2:06:47] it just like our generation
[2:06:50] people are doing all these things are
[2:06:51] they not
[2:06:54] but the same day that lord went out of
[2:06:56] sodom and of manner again
[2:06:59] the same day that lord what the same day
[2:07:02] that
[2:07:02] you the bride will go out of this ass
[2:07:06] the same thing which happened in sodom
[2:07:07] will happen again
[2:07:10] they did it they drank and they bought
[2:07:11] they saw they planted they built it
[2:07:14] but the same day the lord went out of
[2:07:16] sodom
[2:07:17] it rained what and
[2:07:20] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[2:07:24] now why is he trying to quote lord and
[2:07:26] noah because these were examples of the
[2:07:28] end time
[2:07:30] you understand he's trying to get to a
[2:07:32] point which i wanted to get to because
[2:07:34] remember he was talking about the sound
[2:07:35] of man you remember
[2:07:36] so let's go down but now i want i want
[2:07:40] even all of us to read this together one
[2:07:42] two three go for starting
[2:07:44] even that shall it be in the day
[2:07:47] when the son of man
[2:07:53] have you seen it there is a time
[2:07:56] when the son of man is the knockers when
[2:07:58] the son of man
[2:07:59] is going to be revealed again
[2:08:02] but remember he's not talking about the
[2:08:04] time when jesus was on earth
[2:08:06] because by the time he's talking about
[2:08:08] this this is when jesus now is on earth
[2:08:11] and actually jesus himself is talking
[2:08:13] these words and he's saying
[2:08:15] he's giving them examples example
[2:08:16] examples the son of man was already on
[2:08:18] earth at that time
[2:08:19] right but was it like those days when he
[2:08:23] was on earth
[2:08:25] the question is when the jesus was on
[2:08:27] earth was it like the days of lord on
[2:08:28] the days of no
[2:08:31] no the world had not come into the labor
[2:08:34] way
[2:10:04] praise the lord sorry we went off
[2:10:08] our network here had issues okay now i
[2:10:11] want to conclude
[2:10:12] on this the son of man
[2:10:15] was supposed to be revealed again in
[2:10:17] which conditions can now can you now
[2:10:19] tell me which
[2:10:20] condition the sound of my supposed to
[2:10:21] repeat himself which one is condition
[2:10:23] number one
[2:10:24] [Music]
[2:10:25] the condition the prevailing condition
[2:10:28] that would be
[2:10:28] during the time when the son of man is
[2:10:30] going to reveal himself again
[2:10:36] one people would be
[2:10:43] drinking eating giving in marriage
[2:10:46] marrying you know continuing on with the
[2:10:47] life and
[2:10:48] with everything about life and enjoying
[2:10:50] life you understand
[2:10:52] and they will reject you know the word
[2:10:54] and you know that kind of thing
[2:10:56] now he is trying to say i don't have it
[2:10:58] here if you don't mind now
[2:11:01] he was trying to say this and i wanted
[2:11:04] to hear this now
[2:11:06] jesus was on earth at that time he was
[2:11:09] the son of man do you agree
[2:11:11] yes but he is saying the condition of
[2:11:14] the world is going to be like this
[2:11:16] when the son of man must start when the
[2:11:18] son of man
[2:11:20] is revealed what does it mean
[2:11:27] when we are in the end time the son of
[2:11:30] man is going to reveal himself
[2:11:31] again now remember he's not he's not
[2:11:33] saying he's going to come again
[2:11:35] but he's saying he's going to reveal
[2:11:38] himself
[2:11:38] again is someone getting a revelation
[2:11:42] are you getting a revelation here the
[2:11:44] son of man is going to do that
[2:11:46] to be revealed again who is the son of
[2:11:50] man
[2:11:53] jesus christ himself yes remember he is
[2:11:56] not our
[2:11:56] son of man he is the son of man god
[2:11:59] himself in the flesh
[2:12:02] he revealed himself when he came i mean
[2:12:04] he manifested himself when he came on
[2:12:06] earth
[2:12:07] but he is going to reveal himself again
[2:12:09] in the end
[2:12:10] time and when is that time
[2:12:14] when is that time says isn't this the
[2:12:17] end time
[2:12:18] it is our generation so has the son of
[2:12:20] man remember oh hallelujah i don't want
[2:12:23] to preach but now i'm getting anointed
[2:12:24] to preach now listen
[2:12:26] when he reveals himself how shall we
[2:12:28] know that he
[2:12:29] is the son of man
[2:12:34] the spirit the same thing he did when he
[2:12:37] went
[2:12:38] to abraham and sarah when he went
[2:12:41] to the woman of the world when he went
[2:12:43] you understand when he went to nathan
[2:12:44] when he went to all those people the
[2:12:45] same things he did he will do again
[2:12:48] now you will know why brother panama's
[2:12:49] major theme of preaching was
[2:12:51] jesus christ they saved yesterday today
[2:12:53] and forever
[2:12:54] it was the major theme of both campaigns
[2:12:56] and meetings and entire ministry
[2:12:59] he was trying to say we are revealing
[2:13:00] just again today
[2:13:03] like he was revealed in the past
[2:13:06] you don't seem excited you do not seem
[2:13:07] to see this do you say it
[2:13:10] yes who sees it
[2:13:13] and of course if you sit i'll tell you
[2:13:14] to explain it
[2:13:16] look here before you ask
[2:13:19] let me finish this for inspiration now
[2:13:23] brother barnum don't make mistakes oh
[2:13:25] who you mean by the bottom was jesus we
[2:13:27] need to know oh come on
[2:13:29] put that trash down was not jesus
[2:13:33] like i told you he was it wasn't another
[2:13:35] coming of the son of man but he was
[2:13:37] revealing
[2:13:38] the son of man he would come to you and
[2:13:41] he would say
[2:13:42] he would preach the message right after
[2:13:44] preaching that the message
[2:13:45] then he would say if water preaches the
[2:13:47] truth
[2:13:48] then and let me tell you there is no
[2:13:51] preacher
[2:13:52] in our generation and
[2:13:55] since the time of jesus that has ever
[2:13:58] done that
[2:13:59] only by the banana has done today we
[2:14:03] have many prophets right
[2:14:04] listen to them on the youtube yeah i do
[2:14:06] you don't see me listening to them
[2:14:07] sometimes
[2:14:08] i will tell you none of them has ever
[2:14:10] said this and i will tell you who are
[2:14:11] listening to me
[2:14:13] none of them has been able to say what
[2:14:15] brother i'm saying
[2:14:17] after preaching someone then he would
[2:14:18] say if what i've preached is the truth
[2:14:22] then let the god of the bible come now
[2:14:25] and vindicated to be the truth and i'm
[2:14:27] not asking about feeling i'm not talking
[2:14:29] about feelings and excitement and people
[2:14:30] oh he's here no i'm not talking about
[2:14:32] those kind of things
[2:14:34] he tells everybody be quiet sit be down
[2:14:37] relax quiet everything is quite like
[2:14:40] here
[2:14:40] then he would say it's so deep it's
[2:14:42] recorded if you want you can listen
[2:14:44] then he would say if what i pushed you
[2:14:46] and what he was preaching he was it was
[2:14:48] so hard
[2:14:49] so tight and so cut into the heart and
[2:14:51] he would say if what a priest
[2:14:53] is true then let the god of the bible
[2:14:56] come and vindicate me and vindicate this
[2:14:59] truth
[2:15:00] to be the truth and he would keep quiet
[2:15:02] and wait for him to come
[2:15:04] hey you people what are you talking
[2:15:06] about
[2:15:08] we are talking about saint luke 17 30.
[2:15:11] it was in play it was in action
[2:15:15] and then after a moment he would say
[2:15:20] empty
[2:15:22] and then he would say he's here
[2:15:25] he's here now not that he's feeling
[2:15:29] not even excited or anything but he
[2:15:31] would be the way he was
[2:15:32] but then he would say he would announce
[2:15:34] he would make the announcement and he
[2:15:36] would say
[2:15:36] he is now here he is not two feet from
[2:15:39] where i am standing
[2:15:40] he did not say he's here because he felt
[2:15:43] nice but he would say it's here because
[2:15:44] you saw him
[2:15:46] that's how much it was he would see
[2:15:49] visions he would see in this financial
[2:15:51] world and see also in this world
[2:15:52] then he would say is he here he would
[2:15:55] call him the holy spirit
[2:15:56] he would call him the angel of the lord
[2:15:57] he would call him many things but he
[2:15:59] would say he's here the end of the
[2:16:00] covenant he's here at the end of the
[2:16:01] lord
[2:16:02] he's here not to feed from where i am
[2:16:04] standing now he would say
[2:16:05] the things now would change he the son
[2:16:08] of man christ jesus
[2:16:10] would take over this man's voice
[2:16:13] and he would now say i now put every
[2:16:16] spirit in here whether it is cancer what
[2:16:19] demons whatever it is
[2:16:20] you say now i put every spirit in this
[2:16:23] building i'm talking about thousands of
[2:16:24] people
[2:16:26] and all of them i put every spirit in
[2:16:29] here under my control
[2:16:32] for the glory of god
[2:16:35] quiet and then after that in our next
[2:16:37] meeting remind the mind machine i'll
[2:16:39] i'll put some of these clips for the
[2:16:41] people so they can feel the intense of
[2:16:43] the meetings
[2:16:44] and then be able to listen to it by
[2:16:45] themselves after that
[2:16:47] then listen i said after that moment
[2:16:50] then do you know what would happen what
[2:16:52] would follow under that annoying thing
[2:16:54] hallelujah i feel like talking times
[2:16:55] right now
[2:16:57] us under that anointing brother killer
[2:17:00] he would be able
[2:17:01] nothing would go unnoticed under that
[2:17:03] anointing
[2:17:04] nothing he can be able to call out any
[2:17:07] name
[2:17:08] he can be able to tell anybody any
[2:17:11] problem they have
[2:17:12] he can be able to tell them even what
[2:17:14] happened to them they got to call their
[2:17:16] names to tell them even their addresses
[2:17:18] and house numbers
[2:17:20] what are they talking about is there a
[2:17:22] man who can do that on earth
[2:17:23] it's not a man that was god himself the
[2:17:27] son of man
[2:17:28] revealing himself
[2:17:31] in our generation remember it was the
[2:17:34] revelation of jesus christ
[2:17:35] he was trying to show that he has money
[2:17:38] he has a calm
[2:17:40] of course every god called the prophet
[2:17:42] really reveals jesus christ right
[2:17:43] generally speaking but now in the
[2:17:46] ministry
[2:17:48] oh you people are you getting what i'm
[2:17:50] saying i want to finish with this but i
[2:17:51] want to get it also
[2:17:53] there are three groups of people and the
[2:17:56] categories of people in the world today
[2:17:57] even as it was before the first category
[2:18:00] do you know it
[2:18:02] the sodomites are you hearing that
[2:18:07] uh-huh the second category and the
[2:18:10] children
[2:18:10] hey elizabeth please can you tell the
[2:18:13] children to be silent
[2:18:15] okay now we have the first category the
[2:18:18] first category are the sodomites
[2:18:20] the second category are the low types
[2:18:25] if you follow what i'm saying
[2:18:30] and the first category and the third
[2:18:31] category
[2:18:35] abraham okay are you following me
[2:18:40] the lord tights the sodomites the
[2:18:43] abrahamides
[2:18:44] i'm good i'm making might mesmerize
[2:18:46] coming out of there
[2:18:48] sodom and meaning those sodomites are
[2:18:50] meaning the ones who are living in sodom
[2:18:52] the ones who were they the the ones who
[2:18:55] didn't care what whatever will happen
[2:18:57] let us
[2:18:58] live our life even don't we have them
[2:19:00] today
[2:19:01] don't we have the sodomites today they
[2:19:03] don't care what will happen or what god
[2:19:05] will say as long as they do what makes
[2:19:07] them happy
[2:19:07] they even call themselves the other name
[2:19:09] that they have made for themselves gays
[2:19:12] you know what they mean you don't know
[2:19:14] what game mean
[2:19:16] does anyone know what game mean it means
[2:19:18] what
[2:19:21] god bless you who said that yes
[2:19:24] some of you thought that gay is a bad
[2:19:25] word gay means happy i'm gay
[2:19:28] you are gay gay means happy you
[2:19:31] understand
[2:19:32] it means happy but the devil has
[2:19:35] received this sort of minds to think
[2:19:37] that they are happy
[2:19:39] yet they are not happy they are gloomy
[2:19:42] but they've called themselves
[2:19:43] gay in order for them to feel that they
[2:19:45] are what they are happy they are doing
[2:19:47] what makes them happy and therefore they
[2:19:48] are gay
[2:19:49] searched out a new dictionary it means
[2:19:51] happy
[2:19:52] right and so but they're not happy
[2:19:55] they're gloomy
[2:19:56] so they were going to die but i didn't
[2:19:58] care
[2:20:00] fire was coming but they didn't care you
[2:20:02] understand the angels of the lord came
[2:20:04] in their city but they didn't
[2:20:06] because they were thought they were gay
[2:20:10] so we have that category in our world
[2:20:11] today and they're the biggest of them
[2:20:13] they're the biggest
[2:20:14] right they're in governments and
[2:20:16] everywhere okay so even i'm talking t.b
[2:20:18] joshua
[2:20:19] before he is death he said something
[2:20:22] about
[2:20:23] healing such people and they they since
[2:20:25] he had the big following on youtube
[2:20:27] and of course this is on youtube now i
[2:20:28] hope they don't block me also since he
[2:20:30] had a huge following on youtube they
[2:20:32] blocked him
[2:20:33] they said he can no longer you know use
[2:20:36] youtube because
[2:20:38] how come he he he infringes on other
[2:20:41] human rights
[2:20:42] okay well they have a right to do what
[2:20:44] they want to do all right
[2:20:46] but we also have a right to do what we
[2:20:47] want to do are you following me
[2:20:50] and uh that is the first group and they
[2:20:53] are the biggest in the world
[2:20:55] my q we have another group
[2:20:58] you know that other group the royalties
[2:21:02] there are types those ones are religious
[2:21:07] those ones are the nomination of people
[2:21:09] those ones are so-called
[2:21:11] christians they they fear god
[2:21:15] they love god but they don't love him
[2:21:18] enough to run away
[2:21:19] from sin and worries
[2:21:22] they want a little bit of christ and
[2:21:24] they want a little bit of there well
[2:21:26] this man lord he was in the sort of
[2:21:28] imagine he was in sort of
[2:21:31] living there he had medicine in his home
[2:21:33] and then eventually
[2:21:35] these people when they came to him they
[2:21:37] say the angels
[2:21:39] come we go and they and then these men
[2:21:41] were coming no no we want those men who
[2:21:43] have just entered your house
[2:21:44] and then was like no tech please take my
[2:21:45] daughters they even still buy them they
[2:21:47] said ah
[2:21:47] whatever we want your daughters we want
[2:21:49] these men who have just
[2:21:50] entered in here and then and then he
[2:21:52] said brothers
[2:21:54] did you hear what you say he called them
[2:21:55] brothers he was among them
[2:21:58] these are the pastors even who they said
[2:22:00] well who am i to judge they have big
[2:22:01] followings
[2:22:02] the biggest churches can you hear that
[2:22:05] even the pope the other day
[2:22:06] he has the biggest chat in the world he
[2:22:08] said who am i to judge
[2:22:10] he can't judge the sodomites
[2:22:13] he will not do what they do but he says
[2:22:16] do not
[2:22:17] judge them all right
[2:22:21] see he will not judge them okay so
[2:22:24] friends what are we dealing with today
[2:22:28] that is the second category of the what
[2:22:32] low tides these people
[2:22:36] they oh please don't don't lose the
[2:22:38] devil is trying all
[2:22:39] right you can't make you not lose this
[2:22:41] point please stay focused here now
[2:22:44] the second category are there low types
[2:22:47] for them they are christians
[2:22:51] but they are not their bride because of
[2:22:53] many reasons
[2:22:54] and these ones they go through the
[2:22:55] tribulation they do what
[2:22:59] and the bride will not go through the
[2:23:00] tribulation but the church will
[2:23:02] the church will but the bride will not
[2:23:06] the true church of jesus christ won't of
[2:23:07] course but the church naturally
[2:23:08] nominated church will go
[2:23:10] through the tribulation now we find out
[2:23:12] that these
[2:23:13] law tites they even went to um
[2:23:18] how do i know that they go through the
[2:23:20] tribulation because you remember that
[2:23:21] fire
[2:23:22] the fire started falling when they were
[2:23:24] running so
[2:23:25] they suffered really you know even one
[2:23:27] of them the wife of lord became a what
[2:23:30] became a period of sword and many things
[2:23:32] happened then we can continue on even
[2:23:33] what happened to lord and
[2:23:35] his daughters and everything so you can
[2:23:37] see that they go through the tribulation
[2:23:38] they make it somehow but they go through
[2:23:40] the tribulation their life is not life
[2:23:42] like the life of abraham
[2:23:44] but then we have another group
[2:23:45] hallelujah that is the group of the
[2:23:47] abrahamites
[2:23:50] those ones who receive merica's neck
[2:23:54] those ones who receive
[2:23:56] the priest of the most high those ones
[2:23:58] who receive
[2:23:59] god himself the visitation of god
[2:24:01] himself in that generation
[2:24:03] in their camp so three camps are even
[2:24:06] today
[2:24:06] in the world we have the camp of the
[2:24:08] lord and of course
[2:24:09] what happened in the camp of abraham you
[2:24:11] know don't you know
[2:24:13] what was it
[2:24:18] the angel came and and he revealed the
[2:24:21] secrets of their heart
[2:24:23] and so now you can see that camp had
[2:24:26] those with who would reveal secrets of
[2:24:28] the heart but they couple
[2:24:29] the lotus had only those ones who could
[2:24:31] do miracles
[2:24:34] but the miracles they were doing they
[2:24:35] were blinding the people not so
[2:24:38] are you getting a revelation here the
[2:24:40] angels when the men we want them act
[2:24:42] they just escape
[2:24:44] and they slack at them blind by the
[2:24:45] miracles but just by power divine power
[2:24:47] right
[2:24:48] so we see that we have three cat camps
[2:24:50] even in the world today
[2:24:52] we have one camp which are the
[2:24:53] unbelievers they will not go anywhere
[2:24:55] they're just there
[2:24:56] they are they are not believing and then
[2:24:58] we have another camp
[2:25:00] that's the camp of the the the the
[2:25:02] denomination of
[2:25:03] the evangelicals they you know the you
[2:25:04] know spirit whatever they say their
[2:25:06] spiritual pentecostals what those kind
[2:25:08] of
[2:25:08] groups they will save gifts miracles
[2:25:11] signs and wonders
[2:25:11] you know prophets prophetic you know the
[2:25:13] prophetic they call the prophetic
[2:25:15] ministry
[2:25:16] they're running around with that but
[2:25:18] those miracles those sins and ones that
[2:25:20] god has given
[2:25:20] among them it is meant to blind them
[2:25:23] can i give you an example if we are if
[2:25:27] you you know how many knowledge are
[2:25:28] dismantling in the in the charismatic
[2:25:30] church
[2:25:33] you you know you are from the catholic
[2:25:35] church who knows the
[2:25:36] charismatics also here you don't know
[2:25:38] charismatics you don't have charismatics
[2:25:41] charismatic you don't know you just
[2:25:44] don't
[2:25:44] say i don't know you see the charismatic
[2:25:47] people
[2:25:47] are part of the catholic church but they
[2:25:50] worship
[2:25:51] they get in the spirit they speak
[2:25:52] tongues even did you know
[2:25:54] and after that then they begin praying
[2:25:56] hail mary mother of god
[2:25:58] now tell me is there any kind of
[2:26:00] deception bigger than that one
[2:26:04] it's the highest form of deception to
[2:26:07] make you feel
[2:26:08] you also have the spirit so why do you
[2:26:10] need to join the other group
[2:26:12] of the speakers and the the ones which
[2:26:15] were chasing demons and praying for the
[2:26:16] sick
[2:26:16] when you can do it also in the catholic
[2:26:18] church so they remain there
[2:26:20] so also god will send people in the
[2:26:22] world many people are anointed listen to
[2:26:24] this many people who are anointed to do
[2:26:26] science miracles and wonders
[2:26:28] but these signs are miracles that will
[2:26:30] be meant to do what to blind
[2:26:32] the eyes of those people because they
[2:26:34] rejected the life of the truth
[2:26:36] can you imagine then eventually we shall
[2:26:38] have another group that will be the
[2:26:40] group of the
[2:26:40] abrahamics they will receive the angel
[2:26:44] of
[2:26:44] the covenant the angel of the lord they
[2:26:47] will receive
[2:26:48] the son that they what would we call
[2:26:50] today the revelation of the son of man
[2:26:52] is ministry
[2:26:54] this message is the revelation of the
[2:26:56] son of man as you are reading this
[2:26:57] search edge book you notice he talks
[2:26:59] about revelation we didn't even cover
[2:27:00] that today
[2:27:01] but we'll talk about it next time when
[2:27:02] we meet he talks a
[2:27:04] revelation this message is all about the
[2:27:06] revelation of the son of man
[2:27:08] it's a minister of the revelation of the
[2:27:10] son of man christ himself revealing
[2:27:12] himself among us
[2:27:14] and brother banham's ministry was all
[2:27:17] about that
[2:27:18] you see the design between him he even
[2:27:21] talked about the three major
[2:27:22] messengers of the end time one he talked
[2:27:25] about billy graham
[2:27:27] two he talked about
[2:27:30] come on billy graham oral roberts
[2:27:34] and william branham that's where he
[2:27:38] talks about his name
[2:27:39] as abraham branham
[2:27:49] and you can talk about that much when
[2:27:51] you read the message you find all those
[2:27:52] things
[2:27:53] but what is the concept here god this
[2:27:56] number is what
[2:27:58] come on now if you don't shout it
[2:28:03] god is number seven
[2:28:06] god this number is seven and manny's
[2:28:09] number is six
[2:28:10] and god this number is seven
[2:28:13] uh seven is the number of god of
[2:28:17] completion right so we notice that uh
[2:28:21] god reveals himself god is this visits
[2:28:24] us
[2:28:25] in a man named in our generation a man
[2:28:28] named william
[2:28:29] how many letters
[2:28:32] mario now many letters brown hammer many
[2:28:36] letters
[2:28:37] with a h-a-m-h-a-m is god himself
[2:28:42] elohim abraham
[2:28:47] there's a lot of connotation on that
[2:28:48] anyway i'm i'm just giving it to you
[2:28:51] as uh something to inspire you is sort
[2:28:53] of like a doctrine
[2:28:54] but i wanted you to know that abraham
[2:28:58] after he hears and
[2:29:01] receives this marriage deck
[2:29:04] there is something that happened do you
[2:29:06] know what happened what was it
[2:29:11] god bless you his name was changed what
[2:29:15] what happened next
[2:29:19] sister john what happened
[2:29:23] when god visited abraham what happened
[2:29:30] yes
[2:29:33] abraham went to another land
[2:29:36] what which land was that
[2:29:41] abraham's name was changed and abraham
[2:29:44] received
[2:29:44] a child he gave birth to
[2:29:48] a child when the lord visits you in this
[2:29:50] generation with a message of the hour
[2:29:52] the purpose of the message listen to me
[2:29:54] now you'll use a different word here
[2:29:56] the purpose of the message is to
[2:29:58] impregnate you with the spirit of god
[2:30:00] so that you can bring forth
[2:30:03] a child who will be the child
[2:30:07] who will be the child
[2:30:12] with the child the child is christ god
[2:30:16] bless you
[2:30:17] the child is jesus christ he is the one
[2:30:20] we are bringing
[2:30:21] forth in this generation you are
[2:30:23] bringing forth christ out of your life
[2:30:25] you know it will be within you this word
[2:30:27] a world of springing
[2:30:29] living water a way of living water
[2:30:31] within you
[2:30:32] you can see now why you need to study
[2:30:34] the message because it is so much we can
[2:30:37] talk until
[2:30:38] now it is only me talking what about
[2:30:39] when you start
[2:30:41] and the other one starts and the other
[2:30:42] one starts you see why we need to study
[2:30:44] this message
[2:30:46] it is so broad it is so lovely
[2:30:49] it is if you believe this message you're
[2:30:51] not excited to study it and get into it
[2:30:53] then there is a problem
[2:30:55] for sure you either don't believe or you
[2:30:57] don't know
[2:30:58] you don't know what you believe you've
[2:30:59] not yet believed you see
[2:31:02] yes so friends you see
[2:31:05] today it was just an appetizer to
[2:31:07] appetize us
[2:31:09] but you have seen how much and how deep
[2:31:11] we have gone
[2:31:13] do you know how saint luke 17 is
[2:31:15] fulfilled if there is something you want
[2:31:16] to go you want to go out with today
[2:31:18] go out with this one do you know how
[2:31:21] said luke 17
[2:31:22] is fulfilled
[2:31:27] ministry can you add that through the
[2:31:30] ministry of brother branham
[2:31:32] because brother barnham's ministry
[2:31:34] introduced jesus christ
[2:31:37] to us again
[2:31:40] and that jesus christ is william today
[2:31:44] in the form of the word the revealed one
[2:31:47] the spoken word is the review what the
[2:31:49] review what is this in our generation
[2:31:51] today
[2:31:51] that's why we call these books the
[2:31:53] spoken word books
[2:31:54] why because christ has come down to us
[2:31:57] to
[2:31:58] be revealed he has revealed himself to
[2:32:00] us again in our generation
[2:32:03] saints you now see why we need to study
[2:32:05] this message
[2:32:07] we don't need only to be students of
[2:32:09] this message but we need to
[2:32:11] to love god to the exit whereby he will
[2:32:13] reveal himself to us
[2:32:14] those who have not attached the
[2:32:19] the first chapter please read it by the
[2:32:21] time we meet again
[2:32:22] we shall dwell on the first chapter also
[2:32:24] so you have an opportunity also to read
[2:32:26] again those who are finished you can
[2:32:27] read again or continue reading again
[2:32:29] praise the name of the lord i want to
[2:32:31] end the live stream it's been
[2:32:33] so long but um is there anybody who
[2:32:35] wanted something that's something that
[2:32:36] is burning them and they wanted to talk
[2:32:38] all right is it something that you want
[2:32:40] to okay you can go ahead and brother can
[2:32:43] we put a video for you
[2:32:47] yes come on go ahead
[2:32:50] you need some clarity
[2:32:56] okay what's that
[2:33:00] can you please go ahead yes
[2:33:08] [Music]
[2:33:18] where was the holy spirit when jesus was
[2:33:20] on earth and i'm repeating that for the
[2:33:22] one who is here because
[2:33:23] they can't hear you so
[2:33:26] we discussed and um this is how we
[2:33:29] concluded
[2:33:30] yes she requested me to give us so i say
[2:33:33] lord
[2:33:34] jesus and the holy spirit are one
[2:33:38] god was the father of jesus the holy
[2:33:41] spirit was the father jesus too
[2:33:43] as much during the declares
[2:33:46] but while
[2:33:55] [Music]
[2:34:05] [Music]
[2:34:18] and that's true that's true perfectly
[2:34:19] all right yes so i don't like this look
[2:34:22] at teaching the scriptures yes did i get
[2:34:25] by
[2:34:27] yes jesus
[2:34:34] [Music]
[2:34:40] that's the spirit
[2:34:44] [Music]
[2:34:56] so what is the question now because now
[2:34:59] i don't know what i gave at the right
[2:35:01] thing
[2:35:01] [Music]
[2:35:06] but from the line of thought that you
[2:35:07] were having that was perfect
[2:35:10] that was perfect you see there is no
[2:35:13] distinction between
[2:35:14] god and jesus but the only
[2:35:18] thing to understand there is that god is
[2:35:21] a spirit
[2:35:22] and that jesus was the begotten son of
[2:35:24] god
[2:35:25] and because inside we've gone through
[2:35:26] that now to understand that
[2:35:29] jesus was the body but god was the
[2:35:31] spirit in him
[2:35:34] and any scripture that you read will tie
[2:35:35] in together with that
[2:35:37] and of course you cannot separate the
[2:35:38] body and the spirit that's why jesus
[2:35:40] christ is going
[2:35:44] okay i'm sure you want you you still
[2:35:47] need more clarity go ahead
[2:35:57] yes and then one thing also i want to
[2:35:59] tell everybody
[2:36:01] is that the word is never
[2:36:05] something that you
[2:36:08] study or learn
[2:36:11] like you learn your books in school
[2:36:15] you understand yes when you go to school
[2:36:18] they will teach you something maybe
[2:36:19] the law of gravity and you you can even
[2:36:22] just cram it
[2:36:24] and then that it will be to remain what
[2:36:26] you quran
[2:36:27] no matter how many years it is but the
[2:36:30] word isn't that way
[2:36:31] the word is god and god is
[2:36:34] huge and he only allows us to understand
[2:36:38] what he has
[2:36:39] revealed to us next time we're going to
[2:36:41] talk much about
[2:36:42] revelation and revelation is progressive
[2:36:46] progressive progressive progressive
[2:36:49] the more you yield your heart and
[2:36:50] yourself to the word
[2:36:52] the more you understand and the more
[2:36:54] revelation you receive
[2:36:56] of the same verse that you had many
[2:36:58] years ago
[2:36:59] the revelation you had is not the same
[2:37:01] that you had even after our session
[2:37:03] today
[2:37:04] it is increasing increasing it is
[2:37:06] progressive according
[2:37:08] to what you hear and what because it is
[2:37:11] faith revelation is faith we talked
[2:37:13] about it the other time
[2:37:14] revelation is faith the more you hear
[2:37:16] the more you believe faith comes by what
[2:37:19] by hearing the word and so you get
[2:37:22] into the word and the more you get into
[2:37:24] the word the more
[2:37:25] revelation you receive and certainly the
[2:37:28] more faith you believe you receive
[2:37:31] to stand by what you believe praise the
[2:37:34] lord
[2:37:35] there is a song i want us to sing as we
[2:37:36] are concluding

[2:57:39] actually i've i've also been
[2:57:44] here within the service
[2:57:47] beyond my wife and sister joanne we
[2:57:50] we've really
[2:57:52] enjoyed the service and the
[2:57:56] idea precious pastor thank you so so
[2:57:59] much for
[2:58:00] for such an in-depth teaching of the
[2:58:02] word of god
[2:58:04] the only word i would like to to wish
[2:58:07] the youths
[2:58:08] today is one of the things which helped
[2:58:12] me overcome the temptations of the world
[2:58:15] was the word of god because i remember
[2:58:19] when i was still a young man
[2:58:22] there is a verse i read in the bible
[2:58:26] and that verse i i'm not very sure right
[2:58:28] now where it is but it says
[2:58:30] that whoever is joined himself to a
[2:58:33] harlot
[2:58:34] it is actually the scripture says they
[2:58:37] become the same
[2:58:39] spirit that like you share the
[2:58:42] spirit of any person you join
[2:58:47] so when i read that word all
[2:58:50] through my youth though i was still in
[2:58:53] the pentecostal world without the word
[2:58:55] but that word there is a way it kept me
[2:58:58] through
[2:59:01] so i just want to challenge you that let
[2:59:04] us
[2:59:04] not only be here as of this wonderful
[2:59:07] word but let us
[2:59:08] put it into practice shalom and may the
[2:59:11] lord god bless you all
[2:59:14] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[2:59:19] okay so god bless you so much that was
[2:59:21] uh wonderful
[2:59:22] we do appreciate that uh brother henry
[2:59:25] but i saw brother martin somewhere there
