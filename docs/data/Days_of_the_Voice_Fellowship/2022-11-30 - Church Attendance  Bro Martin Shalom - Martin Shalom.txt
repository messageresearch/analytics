I wonder straight there again Hebrews 10 25. 23 says let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering because he is faithful that promise let us hold fast the profession of our faith Amina without wavering for he is faithful that promised you are here because you know that God who gave the promise in this world is faithful to keep it you are clinging to this promise for all these years because you are very sure that God is faithful [Music] what has kept you coming to church it is what has kept you as you're still coming to church it's because of that promise and you are attending you attending church that's where you refuel or you refresh your soul to continue in the battle [Music] blessed in the name of the Lord so there are things which have to hold the past that you are wavy into between and here Apostle Paul said in the letters hold fast the profession of our faith it's not just our faith this is the Faith of Christ blessed be the name of the Lord let us consider one another to provoke and to provoke and to love and to Good Works amen consider one another foreign [Music] who will be in the church bless you the name of the Lord and let us consider one another 25 says not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together [Music] as the manner of some Isa it is Bad Manners not to come for Fellowship blessed with the name of the Lord because when here the Bible is clearly telling us not forsaking assembling to get assembling ourselves together as the manner of some is it is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the days approaching the name of the Lord when we come and We Gather in the presence of God we are encouraging one another amen Apostle Paul says that when I'm out there I'm in the body blessed with the name of the Lord but when We Gather like this God brings this word to encourage us to correct us amen that's why we should always not forsake to assemble together as we are seeing the days are approaching we know the Lord is coming soon amen anytime anything any moment Jesus is because the Bible says that the bride has made ourselves ready we know there is a wedding which is going to take place and God is preparing us for that wedding he's walking on our government he's saying we come for service this time we come for Fellowship God's praying comes with the water of the world to cleanse us why it is written though uh that's why the Bible tells us amen that because iniquity shall abound the command the love of men shall works we'll be having form of godliness if we see it willingfully I don't know that we are received the knowledge of the truth they remain not sacrifice for sin because suddenly fearful looking for looking for of judgment and fair indignation we shall defer the adversaries [Music] [Music] praise the Lord amen Amina and if you go back to the scripture we read also in uh a second you see the son of man speak to the children of thy people amen God is telling the prophet to speak to his people and say unto them when I bring the sword upon the land if the people of the land take a man of their costs him for their Watchmen if when he says the sword come upon the land and the brother trumpet and won the people now foreign [Music] Bible yeah John you listen to the world you find you realize where you are wrong I said hey I was astray I need to come to the right and God is saying he has set the Watchmen to wash over our souls that's why the prophet says God will not take any man to judge me before first warning that man amen and he goes ahead and says that man takes himself to Hell before you go to hell you will fight God blessed with the name of the Lord when the two things were at the cross amen man still the other evil man even after that last moment if you're a Son of God if you are listening after the last moment we will send warnings you will not find any of those warning outside there the warning is here because the time has come when the Judgment of God begins from his house blessed with the name of the Lord amen you can't stand in order foreign let's say the name of the Lord amen Mina and Aussie all to have taken heat up praise be to God Mina Amanda is born of the spirit of God loves to go to church today there is a service and somebody is taking you out for KFC and they are going to buy a full bucket of 60 000. brother what will you do sister what would you say you will call Deacons God bless you Brothers I have got an image it is an emergency they won't tell you the real thing but the world is telling us a man that is born of the spirit of God church when he is hungry the spirit of the spirit of man on the inside has God has has got to be fed to our moon if Batman isn't bad he will die he will die yeah [Music] that foreign all of us many times we get that feeling you have even 100 reasons and all of them are real yeah it's raining the Thunders are blowing [Music] I can't even say Jesus sometimes I ask my body I've been sleeping for the last 30 years what have I gained by the body you rather go back to bed sometimes you find Brothers go in the presence of God Amen praise the Lord foreign amen the other day I was working from agenda towards here I met women lying to each other they are these people go to church and they can be in church yesterday that she can be in church when she's the big time witches I almost interrupted their conversations [Music] a person who showers and one who doesn't there is a difference a person who show us five times a week or ten times a week and the one who show us two times a week there is a big difference foreign Church praise be to God brother when you have good the purpose of the Holy Ghost it separates you it delivers you from the things of the world and it makes you love God Amen you cannot remain home washing while the club when service is going on the Holy Ghost will make you love church it is [Music] not in the presence of God give yourself in worshiping even when you alone sing praise and worship when you're walking amen speak to God keep yourself in the presence of God blessed be the name of the Lord and there is no sacrifice but whatever there is not very much to the service but whatever amen Nina is the message when there is no sacrifice but whatever there is no very much to the service you have to really get down and do and do something that that really bad only not to come we had that first I cannot part with food people um I cannot part with that girl faster even the prophecy that when you love us so much until like when she's not there you can um [Music] don't be deceived foreign [Music] amen it's so painful for him but he had hope in God because the Bible says whoever comes to him he is [Music] the way amen Mina when God sees all of you are wet cartoon because you came during rainfalls when you begin clapping because yes did the rain rain on you because of pride even the brothers okay not been explaining it's like that Fountain bubbling time is probably and animals will come and drink from but when you ask it why it is sacrifice amen we must attend Fellowship we must sacrifice to take into a question no

to go to church and show God [Music] [Music] you are helping your husband to come to church you're helping your brother your mother your father to come to church amen now in the message spiritual adoption he said that when there is something happening down in your heart that makes you love God in such a way you can't stay from the church that is the revelation God revealing amen God wants you to go to church you want to manifest something to you [Music] let us know forsake assembling together as the man of others is [Music] that he is making yeah [Music] you will miss seeing something tell

earth because he has never been to Heaven yes sir wow we are in heaven places in Christ Jesus Christ nobody has ever seen your father foreign [Music] is where they even even in Pope Papa he has never

says excuse and say okay we are still uh we are following the same thought of looking warm and uh this message he says I'm so tired when I come in at night I can't go to church that is excuses today oh I'm tired I'm afraid yeah that husband wouldn't like it is [Music] she will wake you up praise be to God Amen and when I come in at night I can't go to church I'm afraid my uh my wife would kick me out of the house foreign that's why the Bible tells that Solomon says imagine the rain which fell the other day that at least a woman in the house she owed to if that is the kind of money you are you that is right the truth but you but there you are excuses made our no way we require so much my wife will chase me out of the house we stay home to watch this it is too hot to go to church or something like that I don't feel just good you are going to feel worse than that some of these days think about it is me yeah I need some jazz could put some reggaeton because I learned some things you are in the wrong place yeah I don't believe that angels dance reggae the secret is because when the sons of God are worshiping I'm telling you Heaven hospitals this place and they worship with us when you were jumping America stores yep think about it Shadow films before God I'm a singing Holy [Music] God can cast you like the Devils praise be to God and they break those glasses are in hell not in the church amen that's why Paul wrote the Saints who were in Ephesus amen praise you to God that is the God we served and that's why we have to come to church yes a preacher preaches the word which he even doesn't understand praise be to God but when we came besides oh brother sister in the morning at the five we have gone in Novena but you believe the message you want to come at immediately are you okay praise be to God tofu you just think of God when foreign [Music] [Music] am I just about finished amen Amina do this check this little ride okay I don't feel just good okay he says judgment says you don't go to church you don't go you don't go church for thinking it is decent thing to do together go to church to worship God because when you are ready to worship God wait against your sins this is me the good thing this is a midweek service now you have come let me give you a dose when you are coming to church come when you are ready to clap when you're ready to dance don't come here when you are foreign you know by the way is this now you want to see your first checklist oh my God oh my God oh God you find when that share is definitely killing it with your eyes praise be to God if you don't have Hank you sit on it and do like because Christianity is living for others they didn't ask why you are doing that and you're complaining because you are selling fish [Music] who do you want to clean that chair for you we thank the one who has done what they have done but if he has forgotten and done a mistake let us correct that message praise be to God man so when you come here okay I remember one brother one day says not from here but from another child that you come back with your problems peace amen leave your mission at the entrance the devil is like flies you see when you are in that when you're up country there is like here in Africa I don't know in Europe but wait when I get there I'll tell you people some people they move with bunch of Lies [Music] but when you come to the service here don't enter with them flies remain outside come and be charged with the Holy ghosts [Music] will die that is why we come to church we come to become a better Christians praise be to God there are many people who are there they say I will no longer go back to church there are many in this age praise God the Holy Ghost has come he is that picture oh my what a quote um when you get that idea you are just wrong you are wrong but why did the Holy Ghost said teachers in church if he was going to be that teacher yeah we don't need preachers are you listening to me you will meet them fellas you don't need to go to church here is the answer praise the Lord why did God put send the Holy Ghost yes for if he was going to be the teacher that is a question it is joy to go to church sisters again if Deborah tells me that my daughter she will stay home why right she doesn't know why she why she to come to church is supposed to be Joy but thank God if she has not come that is it is the judgment to me they will be the one to remind you to go to church it better happened preparing to go to church so whenever I don't see her here amen praise be to God so he says God said a teacher yatura you don't need to come to church I want to get that right okay he says we are just wrong why did the Holy Ghost set preachers in the church the Holy Ghost is the teacher said that teach us in the church do you think it's contradicting it's joy to go to church whether someone is dying amen whether you have lost somebody through his service come to church whether it's hot or cold whether people are fasting whatever they are doing it is hard for you to go to church and press yourself to come when the church is open there is something wrong the spirit of God will run you right straight to the church every time oh the door opens [Music] that message is will you come to church sisters they are they don't want to shout they say brother not only foreign do you love him I've not even finished my salmon but uh I believe the Lord has spoken to us if we do like that friends you know we don't know what it means by being condemned and you are Justified you were supposed to die story Memorial and he brought the Rope which was as strong as strong things just because we have not got a revelation of worshiping God people who attend all the three services to recharge those who attend one service a week yeah everything has to be different because we eat food every day we eat tomatoes you know the word of God is rich in all nutrients and eats popcorns
