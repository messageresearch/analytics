[21:39] one more thing I've forgotten
[21:43] in the morning my husband wanted me to
[21:47] go
[21:48] to our church
[21:52] service
[21:54] I told him in the morning the preacher
[21:58] told us yesterday
[22:02] so I told him I have to
[22:05] watch
[22:07] I finish it so foreign
[22:21] to display
[22:22] I want to thank God so much I've been
[22:26] receiving and feeling in every meeting
[22:32] I finished it
[22:37] [Applause]
[22:39] amen
[22:41] Glory Glory
[22:43] I believe you young men that are not yet
[22:46] married
[22:49] when I see the sister as young as she is
[22:53] and she still has such testimonies
[22:59] I cannot say as old you know but I'm
[23:02] saying as young as she is
[23:06] where is our daughters can you stand up
[23:10] actually can you come here
[23:13] I had your heart you have testimonies
[23:17] all of you come here
[23:25] yes
[23:27] and and she has such a testimony yeah I
[23:31] know with Jesus
[23:32] of having more and more experience
[23:36] even after having children this site
[23:41] [Applause]
[23:47] the boys who are the boys
[23:49] come on
[23:51] come on
[23:55] all right
[23:58] all right
[24:00] [Applause]
[24:01] oh my God
[24:03] now I think my wife will be your
[24:05] friend's sister Jesse because
[24:08] I say you to have something in common
[24:11] now I need you
[24:13] so what I was saying to you young man
[24:17] all right come on in after the fun this
[24:20] side system
[24:24] yeah those ones who are streaming they
[24:26] want to see you also
[24:27] [Applause]
[24:28] so what I was saying you young men who
[24:32] want to marry
[24:34] you should matter sisters that have
[24:36] received an experience
[24:39] why do you want to marry a girl because
[24:42] she's beautiful
[24:45] someone who has received the Holy Spirit
[24:48] [Music]
[24:52] praise the name of the Lord
[24:59] foreign
[25:05] the Holy Spirit
[25:08] anybody can receive the Holy Spirit if
[25:10] they saw desires
[25:14] haven't we seen God doing it in these
[25:16] meetings
[25:20] so some Believers think when you believe
[25:24] you have received the Holy Spirit
[25:27] that is an experience
[25:39] women or sisters that have not received
[25:43] the holy spirit yet
[25:45] they are spiritual before you marry them
[25:48] they are spiritual before you marry them
[25:53] that one ends they become something else
[26:00] become a monster in the house
[26:03] without the holy spirit so friends let
[26:08] us ensure to have the Holy Spirit
[26:10] so we have our Mama's here sister just
[26:13] say and the other sisters a good example
[26:19] let us emulate them now those ones who
[26:23] are testimonies can stay the others can
[26:25] go back okay
[26:27] the ones who have the testimony
[26:35] foreign
[27:05] I thank God while we were praying yeah
[27:14] [Music]
[27:25] Jesus
[27:30] but she pressed Stone
[27:32] to
[27:34] Jesus himself told him
[27:37] it is not good for me to give the food
[27:40] of the children to that doctor the
[27:42] situations
[28:02] that I have to leave when I when I've
[28:05] received my childhood
[28:07] um
[28:11] those conventions I want to receive the
[28:13] baptism of the Holy now again
[28:15] and I prayed in that Wednesday
[28:18] fellowships that
[28:22] is
[28:23] Jesus keeping his appointments
[28:35] and there she was forgiven her sins
[28:41] my prayer answered
[28:44] I give Gloria an honor back to his name
[28:49] [Applause]
[28:53] is
[28:56] now before the sister speaks let me ask
[29:00] how many here don't understand English
[29:10] anybody
[29:12] okay so we will just use English then
[29:16] God bless you
[29:19] enjoy
[29:21] I want to talk about that I didn't want
[29:24] to come for this meeting
[29:28] precisely because last year in December
[29:31] I attended so many youth meetings
[29:34] and I reached a poet and said
[29:37] now
[29:39] so the sisters of mine kept on calling
[29:42] me on Friday where are you where are you
[29:44] where are you wearing it's like what's
[29:46] up brother I was like I don't want to
[29:48] pack things they told me that you just
[29:51] come
[29:52] just we shall share that books after the
[29:55] size industry as you can see
[29:59] but I want to thank God
[30:01] I've got
[30:02] a fulfillment
[30:05] and there's something that was bothering
[30:08] me so much
[30:09] and I thank God that it was preached by
[30:11] Brother Isaac so actually I gave them
[30:13] that testimony
[30:15] so I want to thank God for that
[30:19] [Applause]
[30:25] it was preached it was bothering you
[30:27] what happened what did the Lord do has
[30:29] the Lord did something about
[30:33] oh yes the Lord has done something I
[30:36] think it was yesterday I
[30:38] I went to Pasta Lima and I told him that
[30:42] I'm having a kind of depression
[30:45] and I think but the reason that's why
[30:49] I've not come to you again it's because
[30:51] I don't have it again
[30:55] Hallelujah
[30:57] [Applause]
[31:00] praise God
[31:03] my name is Sister Miriam chirago
[31:06] I want to thank God for the experience I
[31:09] got
[31:12] it was
[31:14] I had a torment as something like a wall
[31:18] like when you pray you don't feel it
[31:21] okay you don't feel the Breakthrough
[31:24] so I had it before I came for these
[31:27] meetings and I told God I want to get a
[31:31] touch at least the church from you in
[31:34] these meetings
[31:35] so this thing I got it from when I was
[31:40] there's a there's a time which was on
[31:42] Sandy
[31:43] we went to speckled bed Church
[31:48] so the brother called one altar call
[31:51] was
[31:53] for those people who want to get sick
[31:55] so some people came that wanted
[31:59] to to restore their lives as in the
[32:01] backsliders maybe to be prayed for and
[32:06] maybe it was a spirit that told me go
[32:08] there and I refused
[32:11] from that time I felt a block like when
[32:14] I used to pray even when people are
[32:16] getting filled I was not getting a
[32:19] breakthrough
[32:20] so on Saturday when pastor called for
[32:23] the altar call he also said the same
[32:27] words rather give you and say he said
[32:30] that those people want to get saved
[32:34] and the devil came back to me telling
[32:37] don't go yeah those people want to get
[32:40] surgery
[32:42] he said the backsliders and we really
[32:45] mean the backsliders the people who have
[32:47] left us a message started wearing
[32:49] trousers and
[32:51] started cutting their hair and all that
[32:54] so
[32:57] I the devil kept on telling me don't go
[33:00] like you told me last time and I was
[33:03] even scared
[33:05] come in front
[33:07] so I looked and I looked no one was
[33:09] coming he said bow your heads
[33:12] and no one was coming in front
[33:15] but I see if today I'm finishing it
[33:20] so I said I moved in France it was not
[33:24] really easy
[33:25] I took a step and moved in front I said
[33:28] I want like whether it's like so like
[33:31] Jacob he was he wanted
[33:34] he wanted to get that blessing from the
[33:37] Lord
[33:38] he said no matter what comes I must be
[33:40] blessed so I left and came to say
[33:44] and I thank God that she really touched
[33:49] [Applause]
[33:52] before the sister speaks I I want to say
[33:57] that this sister has given a testimony
[33:59] let it impact also your life
[34:01] if God speaks I think you've had
[34:03] ministers saying I say it a lot
[34:05] especially when we're in a time of
[34:07] prayer that whatever he tells you to do
[34:08] you see so
[34:11] she was in a service
[34:13] God spoke to her and she disobeyed
[34:17] and when she disobeyed the devil then
[34:20] came and began to torment her so when
[34:23] you disobey the Holy Spirit the devil
[34:25] will get a room to come in your life
[34:27] it's always good to obey the voice of
[34:30] the Holy Spirit whatever he tells you
[34:32] you might be in a service and it tells
[34:34] you lift up your hands and Shout just as
[34:37] simple as that and you don't
[34:39] and then the Devil comes and commence
[34:40] you so but God is a god of second
[34:43] brother Michael second third fourth
[34:47] fifth sixth seventh chances
[34:49] God is a god of chances and he has given
[34:52] us this another chance and she received
[34:54] devastation
[34:55] we want to praise be to God
[34:58] amen
[34:59] [Applause]
[35:01] praise God
[35:03] my name is Sister patience
[35:07] I I want to thank God
[35:11] for these meetings specifically because
[35:17] last year there are so many things we we
[35:20] attended as they always speaking
[35:23] but there is something they did to me
[35:26] the anointing let me see
[35:30] held me throughout there
[35:33] so this time around I said I must not
[35:36] meet and if I get a chance to attend I
[35:39] must make it minute
[35:43] so I pray to God today in the morning we
[35:46] had morning devotion I prayed
[35:49] but I wasn't feeling a breakthrough
[35:52] but just as brother Michael was
[35:55] preaching and the power went off somehow
[35:57] something told me that's new down there
[36:00] and prayed and I don't know that I was
[36:03] just carried away I thank God for
[36:06] filling me the Holy Ghost again God
[36:08] bless you
[36:12] amen
[36:14] Hallelujah
[36:16] you know by the way nothing goes wrong
[36:19] when we are in the right place
[36:22] you see
[36:24] you know the the power was not supposed
[36:26] to go off we thought that maybe power it
[36:28] was Lord shedding it wasn't
[36:30] you see there was a scenario there the
[36:33] way it
[36:35] got finished in I don't have time to
[36:38] explain it but it was just God wanted it
[36:42] to be that way
[36:43] let me just leave it at that
[36:46] but power went off in the middle of a
[36:48] service
[36:49] but you see it went off at the exactly
[36:53] right moment
[36:56] when the Holy Spirit wanted to come and
[37:00] baptize people at that moment
[37:03] brother brother Michael would have
[37:05] continued
[37:07] so the Holy Spirit had to restrain him
[37:08] by force
[37:10] stop
[37:12] and at that moment the Holy Spirit took
[37:14] over
[37:16] and you can hear such a testimony
[37:18] the devil thought that he was giving us
[37:20] a blow but actually it was God doing his
[37:23] work just like when Jesus Christ went on
[37:26] the cross the devil was happy he was
[37:27] like oh man I'm done with him I'm
[37:30] finishing up with him but he did not
[37:32] know that God was just beginning
[37:33] actually God was climaxing his work for
[37:36] us that's exactly what happened here and
[37:39] we want to thank God for it and for the
[37:42] service that evening praise the name of
[37:43] the Lord
[37:45] amen do you thank God for those
[37:47] testimonies
[37:48] very powerful testimonies
[37:51] [Applause]
[37:53] I have some papers here from the same
[37:55] name so I do not know whether it is the
[37:57] same sister
[37:58] Faith who is this the faith
[38:01] did you write two cheats two papers
[38:04] so probably there is another sister
[38:06] Faith so I'll begin with this I don't
[38:08] know whether you are the one God bless
[38:10] you since I I thank God for the gift of
[38:12] life I have a short testimony is that
[38:14] you
[38:15] no who is this the faith
[38:18] are you still here
[38:23] she's not okay
[38:27] okay then you can come if you're the one
[38:28] I've not read this so but I think you
[38:30] have a testimony you can just come over
[38:35] [Applause]
[38:40] God bless these things
[38:43] I want to thank God for attending this
[38:45] meeting
[38:48] I heard about this meeting from seta
[38:51] convention last year
[38:54] I was yelling and praying to attend
[38:58] on Thursday last week
[39:01] I knew the meeting is starting on Friday
[39:03] I had a lot of morale in me I was
[39:06] telling a certain brother that I don't
[39:08] want to miss the pillar of fire that is
[39:10] going to fall on the Saints I wanted to
[39:13] start with me
[39:15] now on Thursday at night last Thursday I
[39:19] slept I had a dream
[39:23] a certain gentleman was showing me
[39:26] something which was blocking me not to
[39:29] attend this meeting immediately I woke
[39:32] up
[39:33] when I woke up I prayed I said God I
[39:37] have to attend this meeting no matter
[39:39] what to take
[39:41] so on Friday we came
[39:44] we came actually when they were almost
[39:47] starting by preaching
[39:50] and brother Michael preached
[39:53] that we should cut off the way and run
[39:58] it heated my heart I felt touched I felt
[40:02] delivered
[40:04] I felt so happy I felt that burden was
[40:07] in me was all carried immediately
[40:13] so when we were going back to the
[40:15] dormitories
[40:17] I think the devil was annoyed with me
[40:21] saying let me tell you I fell down in
[40:24] that friend I don't know how it happened
[40:27] I got injured my knees were all paining
[40:31] I had pain but I rejoiced I said this is
[40:34] a sign of victory
[40:39] I I talked to a certain brother they
[40:41] gave me first aid
[40:44] so
[40:46] I continued with everything
[40:49] this thing has delivered me I had hatred
[40:53] in my heart for two years
[40:57] I used to pray God how can I forgive
[41:01] these people but it was so hard for me
[41:04] to forgive them because I knew they know
[41:07] the truth they are believers what they
[41:10] have done to me was so painful the
[41:13] moment I think of forgiveness I feel
[41:15] like it is impossible
[41:18] so I thought I'm okay I'm
[41:22] fine
[41:23] glory be to God amen amen

[42:00] has given me
[42:01] through these meetings especially in the

[42:13] think the Morning Glory or the morning I
[42:14] do not know
[42:16] um really got touched on me in the in a
[42:18] different way and I appreciate him
[42:21] so much for that good work he has done
[42:24] in in my heart for it has been my prayer
[42:27] all along you see when you you pray a
[42:30] prayer to the Lord you do not know how
[42:32] or when but he will always answer those
[42:34] prayers
[42:36] and and then it's she says in capital
[42:38] letters thank you Lord
[42:41] amen then she also says I also
[42:43] appreciate the pastor of this church for
[42:44] this wonderful work and good Revelation
[42:46] come from God and you obeyed it thank
[42:49] you Pastor may God richly bless you
[42:51] Sister Mary
[42:53] amen
[42:55] then this is Sister Esther you also have
[42:57] a testimony can you come up
[43:10] bless your Saints
[43:12] I may testimony the devil has been
[43:16] tormenting my life
[43:18] ever since
[43:19] maybe I was nine years
[43:22] I was doing some things that are not
[43:25] good I have someone who can testify
[43:28] about that Sharon
[43:31] she used to tell me Batista why do you
[43:33] do that you're a young girl
[43:36] and I was like you know no one loves me
[43:39] I'm all alone in this world
[43:42] God has left me my mother is not here so
[43:46] I'm alone
[43:48] that had become my anthem
[43:51] every time no one loves me and Sharon
[43:55] used to say I'm tired of that word stop
[43:57] saying it
[43:59] but I don't know why
[44:02] so
[44:03] when the devil saw that one talk on me
[44:07] he brought something else
[44:10] try to kill me in my body
[44:12] I mean my spirit
[44:15] when he told her when it also did not
[44:17] work out
[44:18] I was going to have
[44:21] motor accidents race
[44:25] that also didn't work out
[44:28] and then he tried to bring out something
[44:30] else for everyone in my family to hate
[44:33] me
[44:35] but
[44:36] when brother America was preaching
[44:39] I don't even know how
[44:42] at the moment he said you know some
[44:44] people you say no one loves me everyone
[44:47] hates me I was like oh is this brother
[44:49] unknown because at that very moment I
[44:52] was thinking about that
[44:54] and they say God loves you and
[44:57] another time Pastor was also preaching
[44:59] and he said even if you don't care God
[45:02] cares even if you think no one cares God
[45:05] will still care for you
[45:07] when brother Michael said that and they
[45:10] remember the words Pastor said
[45:12] I thought that burden was off of my
[45:15] heart
[45:16] I was not going to come to the altar
[45:20] but I wanted to come but still something
[45:23] you told me don't bother going if you go
[45:27] no
[45:28] everyone will laugh at you don't go
[45:30] but I don't even know I just opened my
[45:33] eyes and found myself here kneeling down
[45:37] I thank God that he delivered me but
[45:40] bless you
[45:42] [Applause]
[45:46] and if you have that Spirit of Rejection
[45:48] on you
[45:49] even right now I cast it out in the name
[45:52] of Jesus Christ
[45:53] you know that's a bad Spirit it brings
[45:57] many many things and we thank God that
[45:59] he still delivers
[46:01] you believe that he still delivers Amen
[46:05] brother yes are you are you there
[46:08] are you ready
[46:10] this is an amazing testimony he shared
[46:12] it with me a little bit of wheat I don't
[46:14] know how far he will go in sharing it
[46:16] tonight but uh let us allow him to come
[46:19] this is our brother doing the streaming
[46:22] okay you can come up
[46:27] thank you
[46:36] sister hope from enter the church you
[46:38] can also prepare to come after brother
[46:44] amen
[46:45] God bless you all
[46:50] I don't have where to start from because
[46:54] a testimony
[46:57] it's all the same
[46:59] so I want to start with the scripture
[47:04] sing Galatians chapter 6 verse 8.
[47:32] all right I won't take long but
[47:35] spanning
[47:37] so chapter 8 says
[47:41] for he that soweth in his for he that
[47:45] sow it to his phrase
[47:48] shall of the fresh rip corruption
[47:51] but he that soweth to the spirit shall
[47:56] of the spirit
[47:57] reap everlasting life
[48:01] then another one is in Romans
[48:16] oh
[48:18] Romans chapter 8
[48:33] all right chapter 8 verse
[48:41] yeah versatile
[48:43] are therefore breathing
[48:45] we are datas not the phrase
[48:49] to live after the fresh
[48:52] get that word
[48:56] for if ye live after the flesh he shall
[49:00] die
[49:04] whatsoever kind of death
[49:06] but if you through the spirit do modify
[49:09] the Deeds of the body
[49:12] it shall live
[49:14] for as many as laid by the spirit of God
[49:18] they are the sons of God
[49:20] for ye have not received a spirit of
[49:23] bondage again to fear but ye have
[49:26] received the spirit of adoption where we
[49:29] cry Abba Father
[49:32] so
[49:33] I just realized from Friday
[49:38] through the meetings on Saturday
[49:40] on Sunday today
[49:44] some came out in me that I had never
[49:47] seen
[49:50] I realized I had
[49:53] it's coming to 10 years since I believed
[49:57] and
[49:59] brother Isaac when he was preaching this
[50:03] way he mentioned that there are some
[50:05] people
[50:07] who think like they say that hey for us
[50:10] even if when we were in our mother's
[50:12] wombs we were saying amen and they think
[50:16] that serves them
[50:19] and it's absurd
[50:22] so
[50:24] thought about myself I believed
[50:27] I were
[50:29] under the custody again
[50:33] under the guidance like under a pastor
[50:38] so I was a pastor's son
[50:43] from there
[50:45] I came
[50:47] to him still I became his son
[50:52] so I would have also been like one of
[50:55] those people
[50:57] who say maybe
[51:00] because it's like that
[51:03] stay with the pasta is near me Maybe
[51:06] his righteousness
[51:09] is okay
[51:11] so
[51:13] being too many places many conventions
[51:15] here and abroad
[51:19] but this was a life-changing situation
[51:24] I was there walking alone
[51:28] but sometimes the musician this is this
[51:31] the mission this goes to you sometimes
[51:33] we be you know they are praying that
[51:35] spirit is moving but because you're
[51:37] praying the piano
[51:39] you don't yield and at the end of the
[51:41] door it goes
[51:47] we end up getting nothing
[51:50] because we think we're working for the
[51:52] Lord by throwing that day comes I don't
[51:55] think that would be an excuse
[51:58] so
[52:00] ourselves was going on
[52:04] happens but
[52:05] but his name was
[52:07] something big
[52:09] saint
[52:10] putting that thing there
[52:14] and moving if it falls
[52:17] whatsoever happens Let It Be
[52:22] I came this was on Saturday uh
[52:26] after the
[52:28] morning service
[52:32] when I were here we were many I don't
[52:35] even remember I may wear like besides me
[52:38] so the ministers came and started
[52:40] praying you know
[52:42] and
[52:46] I had one prayer
[52:50] I want the this phrase to die
[52:59] and
[53:01] yeah it has been on my heart you know
[53:03] like everyone in this Christian Journey
[53:06] we are in fresh and
[53:08] we do many things
[53:10] that we think no one is seeing us you
[53:13] know at school at our workplaces
[53:16] we identify that we are born again say
[53:20] for me I'm born again
[53:23] that's how we we say
[53:28] but your words it could be the
[53:32] and uh
[53:37] the things that happen let's say you
[53:40] know your work we are having a party
[53:43] and
[53:46] yes you say I'm I'm born again but when
[53:49] there are those things that other those
[53:51] people do
[53:52] uh you also take part
[53:57] and I believe it's a reproach
[54:01] Christ right
[54:03] so
[54:05] I always say that yeah that was my
[54:06] prayer I didn't have anything else we
[54:08] have any other Pro we have other
[54:10] problems but then I had only one prayer
[54:13] and that was it so as I were needing
[54:15] here
[54:17] the ministers they they were praying and
[54:23] I don't know it was uh touched prayed I
[54:27] was also praying
[54:31] I was feeling one thing
[54:34] someone is going to come and touch my
[54:37] head and pray with me and that will be
[54:41] so I am touching my shoulders prayed
[54:45] like when you didn't pray
[54:47] and moment came
[54:50] one Minister came and
[54:53] before that one was judging me
[54:59] but I didn't do it
[55:01] so
[55:03] I were praying one Minister came and
[55:05] laid the hands on me
[55:08] and that was it
[55:12] felt it's really done
[55:19] rhythm I can't just fight you that
[55:25] I'm no longer a Slave To Fear
[55:28] slave to sin
[55:35] and all the services that had been
[55:38] preached it's been all about my life
[55:41] I don't know about you but me everything
[55:45] a hundred percent
[55:47] so
[55:50] I had never been saved
[55:54] since I was even the best I mentioned it
[55:59] I had never been saved
[56:03] unto you that moment
[56:19] I hope
[56:21] these
[56:28] finds you in a situation
[56:31] whichever situation you may be in
[56:35] it's the only way to go
[56:38] God bless you
[56:40] that's my testimony
[56:51] when that happens there is no better way
[56:53] to explain it
[56:55] by the way you can't explain it the
[56:58] words we are hearing here these people
[56:59] speaking it's just that at the tip of
[57:02] the iceberg that is there's much more
[57:04] that the Lord has done in their life but
[57:06] this is just a little to encourage you
[57:08] also if you've not attained
[57:11] amen uh we appreciate God you know the
[57:14] musicians you know the people that work
[57:17] in the church sometimes they we you miss
[57:20] a lot you I wonder I was in in Kenya I
[57:23] was in western western Kenya and and the
[57:27] Holy Spirit was so interesting the
[57:29] service and and then one young man was
[57:32] at the altar praying and everybody was
[57:34] praying everybody in the church was
[57:35] praying and then the Holy Spirit was
[57:37] just so intense in the service and then
[57:39] this young man started to speak in
[57:41] tongues out loud and so there was like a
[57:43] hush in the congregation and at that
[57:46] time as he was concluding to um
[57:50] to speak in the tongues the Holy Ghost
[57:53] Just Came Upon me and I was going to
[57:55] bust out in the interpretation of
[57:58] those tanks and I I had I had spoken
[58:03] like a one or two
[58:04] and then there was another brother
[58:07] who was incidentally a Pianist sorry a
[58:11] guitarist I don't know which kind of guy
[58:13] was playing and then he got up quickly
[58:16] on on his feet with his guitar in his
[58:19] hands and he put it up in this in in
[58:21] like in the air and he started
[58:23] interpreting the tongues that the other
[58:25] brother had spoken but you see the first
[58:28] two words he spoke was exactly what I
[58:30] had put out on my mouth so I held my
[58:32] peace but the Holocaust was just
[58:34] bubbling in my heart and he said
[58:35] everything that the leader that the
[58:38] first ones he said was exactly what was
[58:40] in my heart to say and then the rest of
[58:42] it that he interpreted but look this
[58:44] brother was a
[58:46] a guitarist
[58:48] if he had not yielded enough to the Holy
[58:50] Ghost you see God would not have used
[58:53] him and when that moment when that
[58:55] happened oh my God that was like you
[58:58] know someone had taken the Holy Spirit
[59:00] and powered it upon everybody there was
[59:02] like a very wonderful worship and so
[59:06] friends that's what we want to have in
[59:08] our fellowship in our fellowships where
[59:10] even the musicians and all the people
[59:11] that work there as people streaming and
[59:14] everybody is touched by the anointing of
[59:16] the holy spirit amen
[59:18] uh who did I call Sister Florence from
[59:21] interview
[59:23] are you here
[59:24] okay you have to be fast because we we
[59:27] have a few more and uh if you've not
[59:30] written I will not call you so you're
[59:31] going to miss out
[59:33] so uh if I call you come a little
[59:35] quickly so you can get to conclude
[59:38] bless your church
[59:44] ah okay and I'm here to testify
[59:50] I think I'm one of the last people that
[59:52] I sent in my testimony and then boom I
[59:56] had to say it I would love it
[59:58] when Pastor said he wanted us to give
[1:00:01] our testimonies it is not a question and
[1:00:03] answer session but it's a testimony
[1:00:06] session Something Told Me
[1:00:12] I didn't believe that I had to tell the
[1:00:16] testimony
[1:00:18] I trembled I was like I'm not doing this
[1:00:21] but then when I was sitting the sister
[1:00:24] Florence was like do you think it's
[1:00:26] worth keeping quiet
[1:00:28] I just returned my paper right now
[1:00:31] and I believe what I'm going to say
[1:00:34] someone else might have gone through it
[1:00:37] and I pray God will change you
[1:00:42] um this partner has called me on
[1:00:44] Wednesday she told me hope let's go for
[1:00:47] the convention I told her I don't have
[1:00:50] money but I had 70 000 on me I was like
[1:00:54] I don't have money I will not go
[1:00:58] then I sat down I looked at my two
[1:01:01] friends sleep my roommates
[1:01:04] but then I did not get sleep in me
[1:01:07] I sat on a stool and I listened to the
[1:01:10] song see what the Lord has done
[1:01:14] I listened to that song more than seven
[1:01:16] times
[1:01:18] then something told me
[1:01:20] you go there you'll get a piece of mine
[1:01:24] I was battling depression I felt I'm
[1:01:28] alone I felt I'm rejected I had hatred
[1:01:34] I had always prayed for God to pick a
[1:01:38] call like he picked for prophet Isaiah
[1:01:41] and passed it on his lips that they
[1:01:44] could no longer speak and clean
[1:01:47] and that was me today
[1:01:49] God did it for me I am no longer the
[1:01:53] same
[1:01:54] this morning
[1:01:56] when Pastor was concluding actually a
[1:02:00] pastor was
[1:02:02] finalizing the the morning devotion
[1:02:06] I felt the angel of the Lord stand right
[1:02:09] next to me and something was like if you
[1:02:12] don't hold on me now it is now or never
[1:02:17] I do not know but I felt electricity
[1:02:21] goes through me and I shouted oh my joy
[1:02:26] that trials my soul I now know that test
[1:02:30] of Freedom glory to Jesus I now know
[1:02:34] what it tastes like to be a true
[1:02:36] Christian when you're free from what the
[1:02:39] world holds you accountable for
[1:02:42] you could go and pray and something
[1:02:44] tells you um
[1:02:50] when new friends are not there you talk
[1:02:52] about about them and now are you wasting
[1:02:55] your time here praying
[1:02:57] yesterday in the morning Division I have
[1:02:59] my best friend she's brother Enoch's
[1:03:01] sister she's called memory
[1:03:04] my heart told me today you're not
[1:03:07] praying for yourself you are praying for
[1:03:10] memory
[1:03:12] it told me a Christian does not live for
[1:03:15] themselves a Christian lives for others
[1:03:18] I prayed for my sister and I don't know
[1:03:22] I now feel free to talk about her I feel
[1:03:26] the burden has been lifted
[1:03:28] I told God she is not here at this
[1:03:33] moment she might have missed it but Lord
[1:03:35] she will not miss my prayer
[1:03:38] I knew one thing that the Lord has been
[1:03:42] so good to me and the Lord will be so
[1:03:46] good to her
[1:03:48] I want to thank God for the ministers
[1:03:51] every time they preached I felt attached
[1:03:56] there is no moment it passed me
[1:03:59] there is no moment I felt I was not home
[1:04:04] this is my first time attending meetings
[1:04:09] but if history needs to be written I am
[1:04:12] writing it down
[1:04:15] I want to thank God today
[1:04:17] for I can sing I am no longer the same
[1:04:21] God bless you
[1:04:25] [Applause]
[1:04:29] that is the Hope
[1:04:31] God bless you so much is the Hope for
[1:04:33] that wonderful testimony
[1:04:35] amen sister Florence
[1:04:38] are you here also

[1:04:48] microphone
[1:04:52] God bless you Chad
[1:04:54] my name is can you can you come like
[1:04:57] this side
[1:04:58] I'm really too scared
[1:05:01] foreign
[1:05:07] speaking they told us to admit it like
[1:05:10] when you're scared you admit it before
[1:05:11] the people and you can't get the
[1:05:13] confidence I believe God has given it to
[1:05:16] me
[1:05:17] yes so I never wanted to give my
[1:05:21] testimony in the first place but then
[1:05:24] something touched me and I was like
[1:05:26] really I can't do this I fear standing
[1:05:30] before the people but now I feel like
[1:05:32] I'm not scared anymore
[1:05:34] yes one thing my dad disowned me
[1:05:40] after believing
[1:05:42] taught me you either be a Catholic or a
[1:05:45] Christian if you're a Christian may I
[1:05:47] don't give birth to Christians you watch
[1:05:50] out of my God
[1:05:52] so I just stood and I said God
[1:05:55] just help me this is too much on me I
[1:05:58] love my dad so much
[1:06:00] it was really too much for me to choose
[1:06:03] but I had to choose Christ I told my dad
[1:06:07] you know what I'm a born again I'm
[1:06:10] served
[1:06:11] I love your dad and I'm going with
[1:06:14] Christ he started slapping me and you
[1:06:18] got a stick and he started hitting me I
[1:06:21] went out of my father's home when he's
[1:06:23] throwing stones on me like oh you silly
[1:06:26] girl did I take you at campus to start
[1:06:28] being a Christian silly thing
[1:06:31] so I say to God
[1:06:33] this cross is too much on me now you
[1:06:36] told us to take our cross and follow you
[1:06:38] dead but I'm taking this one God please
[1:06:41] bear it with me I went out when I I was
[1:06:45] in a night because he did it early in
[1:06:47] the morning and Sanders
[1:06:50] I just stayed when I stepped out of the
[1:06:53] gate I said to God
[1:06:55] as long as I get a church or he's gonna
[1:06:58] be well some of you know me as Pastor
[1:07:02] like brother Michael's child but I'm not
[1:07:04] brother Michael's daughter
[1:07:06] he's just adopted me like after being
[1:07:09] thrown out
[1:07:11] yes that man is a good person and really
[1:07:15] Christians we need to show our works
[1:07:18] because me I had just come in so when I
[1:07:22] go to church
[1:07:24] until they charge they I talked to the
[1:07:28] pastor my dad never used like he never
[1:07:31] wanted me to pray whenever he could Pine
[1:07:33] he could find me praying he used to tell
[1:07:36] me I told you to pray millember Maria
[1:07:38] and Stephanie that's all why are you
[1:07:41] wasting time praying these Christian
[1:07:43] things in being saved what kind of silly
[1:07:46] thing is that
[1:07:48] so I say to God help me but I kept on
[1:07:52] believing me I had lost hope like I used
[1:07:55] to ask myself how am I going to leave my
[1:07:57] father's home because for us we used to
[1:07:59] just stay in that gate not going out not
[1:08:01] doing nothing used to take us at school
[1:08:04] and bring us back home we used to be so
[1:08:07] irritated and sometimes we could just
[1:08:10] sneak out and do certain silly things I
[1:08:13] could I won't talk about them now
[1:08:15] but I found God damn saved and I stood
[1:08:18] for Christ I'm encouraging you
[1:08:21] Christians please stand with the Lord
[1:08:24] so I was going through something this
[1:08:27] week actually not this week but through
[1:08:29] this holiday me and my journalist by
[1:08:32] profession
[1:08:33] but I ended up in teaching
[1:08:36] since I was by the time I left my
[1:08:39] father's my father's home I was a
[1:08:41] directories I was running my father's
[1:08:43] School
[1:08:44] brother Julius from interview Church
[1:08:46] some of you know him he's the one who
[1:08:48] witnessed to me this gospel he came he
[1:08:51] found me when I'm a Pentecostal I used
[1:08:54] to love the Lord I used to move with the
[1:08:56] radio around past that Thomas radio you
[1:08:58] know Pastor told me I used to listen to
[1:09:01] that man
[1:09:02] I could always love the word so
[1:09:06] my father used to always squirrel I
[1:09:08] don't want to listen to that thing
[1:09:09] switch it off what words but since there
[1:09:12] was a seed in me
[1:09:14] it kept me going that thing kept me
[1:09:16] going I wasn't stopped even if it took
[1:09:20] me choosing between my dad and
[1:09:24] and Jesus I say it Lord I'm choosing you
[1:09:28] I did not choose him my me myself I
[1:09:31] believe he's the one who chose me
[1:09:33] because I couldn't do that it's undoable
[1:09:36] it's really hard like leaving your
[1:09:39] father it's hard
[1:09:41] I remember the first day I sat with my
[1:09:43] dad
[1:09:44] I missed that there like always
[1:09:47] because I knew which when it was going
[1:09:50] to happen I knew it I prayed I felt a
[1:09:54] burden on my heart and I was like I'm
[1:09:56] leaving this home soon I used to tell my
[1:09:59] sisters do you know you guys I'm leaving
[1:10:01] this place soon they couldn't believe me
[1:10:03] they just kept on laughing they said
[1:10:06] please you're running mad with that
[1:10:08] Christianity of yours so when that day
[1:10:11] came the Lord Jesus gave me the
[1:10:13] scripture of Luke 1 37 when Pastor you
[1:10:18] preached about that word I was really
[1:10:20] blessed because that is my word I keep
[1:10:22] it I keep it I I keep it as my word
[1:10:26] because he told me the Holy Ghost shall
[1:10:29] overshadow there and you will be able to
[1:10:31] do it really the Holy Ghost overshadowed
[1:10:34] me and I was able to do it so when I
[1:10:37] lived with brother Michael for some like
[1:10:40] I live with him for one and a half yeah
[1:10:43] yes after this barrier I left his home
[1:10:48] around May and I got a job there was a
[1:10:53] certain woman had meters Pro you know
[1:10:55] it's Pro where we collect exams from I
[1:10:58] had going to collect exams for my school
[1:11:00] and she also had one there to get exams
[1:11:03] so we exchanged contacts as directors
[1:11:06] and she wanted to visit our school so we
[1:11:09] did all that and I came to know her so
[1:11:12] God doesn't do things accident tell that
[1:11:15] woman happened like she's the one who
[1:11:18] gave me that job after some time when I
[1:11:20] had left the other she did not give me
[1:11:23] the interview I remember I was not a
[1:11:24] teacher by profession but since I had
[1:11:26] that experience I was running the school
[1:11:28] that is how I was able to get that job
[1:11:31] so when I got that job
[1:11:33] I I've walked they're not giving me a
[1:11:37] lot of money but now the way the lady
[1:11:39] was acting she's she's this kind of a
[1:11:42] person who doesn't that she doesn't she
[1:11:46] doesn't have administrative skills she
[1:11:48] does she just runs her school as if
[1:11:51] she's managing kids and teachers she's
[1:11:54] treating teachers as children
[1:11:56] disrespecting them now me who whom she
[1:12:00] had helped she has always been telling
[1:12:02] people I just helped that one she
[1:12:04] doesn't even have papers I helped her so
[1:12:06] I was really fed up with that thing I
[1:12:08] said God I'm really tired of this
[1:12:11] hypocrisy this woman can come and laugh
[1:12:13] with me and then go to other people and
[1:12:14] tell her this and that I said Lord I'm
[1:12:17] leaving this place I'm not going to work
[1:12:19] for these people again
[1:12:21] so then I talked to mommy brother
[1:12:23] Michael's wife
[1:12:25] I told her mommy I really don't feel
[1:12:26] like going back to this place I'm crying
[1:12:29] every night for sure my pillow has been
[1:12:32] full of tears I've been crying every
[1:12:34] night that is what led me here to come
[1:12:37] for these conversions because I did not
[1:12:39] know it's hope that one where she's the
[1:12:41] one who told me on Wednesday that's when
[1:12:43] I came to know I had only 50 000 with me
[1:12:46] I said God even if I use it all I don't
[1:12:49] know what will happen after but let me
[1:12:51] go for these conversions I really felt
[1:12:54] depressed I had pain I was crying I said
[1:12:57] God please help me when I came here I
[1:13:01] thought that peace when the word was
[1:13:03] preached I felt encouraged Christians
[1:13:05] I'm telling you it is really hard to
[1:13:08] talk to people when you want them to
[1:13:10] encourage you like to to tell to what
[1:13:12] are you the other seat that is in you
[1:13:14] that you can even if you live you leave
[1:13:17] that job there is there is something God
[1:13:19] can do I told them I believe God can do
[1:13:22] something even if I leave this job I'm
[1:13:24] too stress I can't really money it was
[1:13:26] even if I go to that school I just my
[1:13:29] heart just
[1:13:30] like I just feels too stressed I really
[1:13:33] can't work in such an environment and
[1:13:36] apparently I've been sleeping in that
[1:13:38] lady's house she offered me a house so
[1:13:42] it is at your house I have to to to
[1:13:45] leave it so I was really stressed I said
[1:13:47] good now if I go away from this job I
[1:13:50] have no father he disowned me if I go
[1:13:53] whenever where am I going to go should I
[1:13:55] go back to brother Mike was home the man
[1:13:57] who has never to help me up to now
[1:13:59] should I really go back yet I don't want
[1:14:01] to work here everyone was telling me
[1:14:04] Florence one bad in your hand is better
[1:14:06] than 10 birds in the bush you don't know
[1:14:08] about I was really discouraged I said to
[1:14:11] God this is not your word Mark 11 22
[1:14:14] says have faith in God is that word in
[1:14:17] vain I said good you're a boyfriend if I
[1:14:21] leave this job you can still provide so
[1:14:23] when brother Mike who preached about
[1:14:25] faith stuff and he said God can
[1:14:28] strengthen those those ones who are weak
[1:14:30] I really felt strengthened so after
[1:14:34] talking to some brothers this evening I
[1:14:36] was I was there eating supper and then
[1:14:38] something touched me and told me like if
[1:14:40] the testimony to this brother I talked
[1:14:42] to a certain brother when they had my
[1:14:44] Testament they told me sister you can
[1:14:46] even if you leave that job you can but
[1:14:49] all people like my friends from my
[1:14:51] favorite imitating me Florence don't
[1:14:53] leave that job don't live and I'm a
[1:14:55] person who always want to listen to
[1:14:57] advice I said God if I felt I would say
[1:15:00] we're told I should not listen I said
[1:15:03] what you know me I'm just a red Seth by
[1:15:06] your grace I'm just alone here because
[1:15:08] it's really do you know the feeling of
[1:15:10] feeling alone when no one can help you
[1:15:13] you have not that life you can cry and
[1:15:16] tell him that I need this and he can
[1:15:18] provide you all alone providing for
[1:15:20] yourself so it was really hard I was too
[1:15:24] stressed I said now I'm done if I leave
[1:15:26] this job what is going to happen and
[1:15:28] then on the other side I heard faith I
[1:15:30] said good if I left my father's home and
[1:15:34] you've looked after me up to now will
[1:15:36] you really fail if I leave this job you
[1:15:39] will not fail isn't it Brethren I said
[1:15:43] what you can so those Brothers have
[1:15:45] really encouraged me they have told me
[1:15:47] you can't and the message has really
[1:15:49] also encouraged me I can I'm going to
[1:15:51] leave that job I won't get I won't die
[1:15:53] because of my job I know my God will not
[1:15:56] leave me alone
[1:16:00] God bless you thank you so much
[1:16:11] something about being rejected and
[1:16:13] suffering reports for Christ my mother
[1:16:15] told me if you're going to believe that
[1:16:17] stuff I'm disowning you you're no longer
[1:16:20] my son
[1:16:21] but you see God can turn things around
[1:16:24] in our favor if we decide to accept
[1:16:27] reproach for the sake of Christ I know
[1:16:29] that God will not disappoint you my
[1:16:32] sister
[1:16:34] uh there is a sister what's the name of
[1:16:35] the system where's the star begin you
[1:16:38] gave you I think I we lost your paper
[1:16:41] but God remembered you've come
[1:16:47] praise God Church
[1:16:50] um I want to sound good that I'm here
[1:16:54] because I know God doesn't do things by
[1:16:56] coincidence but I can literally say I'm
[1:16:59] here
[1:17:00] I think God had his own programs right
[1:17:04] now I think I would be at home having
[1:17:05] supper
[1:17:07] because
[1:17:09] it was actually rather Enoch who told me
[1:17:11] on Sunday that
[1:17:12] sister Abby we have this uh this this
[1:17:15] convention
[1:17:16] on Friday
[1:17:19] and like I'd not even heard anything
[1:17:20] about it
[1:17:22] but I had so many questions that I'd
[1:17:26] been asking that
[1:17:29] I listened to Pentecostal pastors a lot
[1:17:32] until I found that
[1:17:35] their messages to our preaching while
[1:17:37] being repeated over and over again and
[1:17:39] they were still not answering my
[1:17:40] questions
[1:17:41] because and that led me to read my Bible
[1:17:44] because there's a pastor who came to our
[1:17:46] church and I noticed every time he read
[1:17:49] a scripture and the scripture seemed to
[1:17:51] turn into our Paradox he would go to
[1:17:53] another scripture and that scripture
[1:17:55] would answer that question
[1:17:57] so I was like if we could find answers
[1:17:59] in this Bible
[1:18:01] I actually read my Bible every night but
[1:18:03] I would read as a religion you know how
[1:18:05] you read and you don't get anything
[1:18:09] that's how I was
[1:18:11] I started with the New Testament I
[1:18:14] started understanding Testament when I
[1:18:15] was about to finish
[1:18:19] I finished it and I went to some
[1:18:23] was very nice but I wasn't enjoying it
[1:18:25] because there are so many nice things
[1:18:26] and I was so busy trying to get a
[1:18:28] prescription in my head until I reached
[1:18:30] a point and I was like God
[1:18:32] I don't want scriptures to turn into a
[1:18:34] Bad Thing help me to understand the
[1:18:37] scripture and enjoy reading it until
[1:18:40] finally helped me and told me a big girl
[1:18:43] you want to enjoy because I was reading
[1:18:45] Psalms and Samuel at the same time first
[1:18:48] Samuel like the somewhere you read past
[1:18:50] Samuel is the same way I want you to
[1:18:51] read psalms because faster mode is a
[1:18:53] story so there's really not much to
[1:18:55] memorize
[1:18:56] so I started drinking sums and I really
[1:18:59] felt like everything was flowing it was
[1:19:01] like I was speaking with David
[1:19:03] and I started understanding so I I kept
[1:19:06] on looking for answers and at some point
[1:19:08] I was like I wanted to read a chapter
[1:19:10] from every book because
[1:19:12] I thought like there's still certain
[1:19:14] questions I want to answer and like I
[1:19:17] would read scriptures in the Bible and I
[1:19:20] sit on my bed for about 15 minutes
[1:19:22] trying to meditate on that scripture and
[1:19:24] find an answer but I'll feel God telling
[1:19:26] me you keep reading I'll answer that
[1:19:28] question
[1:19:28] and I I would I had so many answers I
[1:19:32] would even forget them
[1:19:34] even I had questions I feel like God
[1:19:37] would read my mind because like I'd I'd
[1:19:41] have questions in my mind that somehow I
[1:19:44] know God might tell me this one to wait
[1:19:47] so I don't ask him the question
[1:19:49] and I just keep it in my mind and I even
[1:19:52] don't know I asked it but I know I did
[1:19:56] but I came to this convention
[1:20:00] and I really felt like God was telling
[1:20:03] me
[1:20:04] listen to those pastors because I was
[1:20:07] beginning to question what you are
[1:20:08] telling me you know how we like start
[1:20:10] putting a filter in your head when the
[1:20:12] pastor is preaching to get only what you
[1:20:14] need you told me don't do that that is
[1:20:16] me speaking if you want to get the
[1:20:18] answers to those questions you have been
[1:20:19] asking it's going to be now
[1:20:21] so I put aside that filter and I decided
[1:20:24] to listen
[1:20:25] I thank God that he has answered all my
[1:20:29] questions
[1:20:34] and also another thing when Pastor Mike
[1:20:38] was preaching and Pastor Isaac they kept
[1:20:41] on talking about certain things
[1:20:43] he talked about Pride
[1:20:45] they talked about fear and something
[1:20:47] else that are forgotten
[1:20:49] but
[1:20:51] he talked about prayed and honestly I
[1:20:55] was proud and I didn't know it
[1:20:57] I was very proud and Nega sister who was
[1:20:59] next to me pointed at no I was like are
[1:21:01] you proud
[1:21:02] and I felt like for real I'm proud
[1:21:07] I looked at myself and like my mom told
[1:21:09] me there's certain blessings God did not
[1:21:12] give me because honestly if you gave me
[1:21:14] that blessing I was going to disgrace
[1:21:15] his name and then when she told me that
[1:21:17] I was like if I have because I talked
[1:21:20] about what she was talking about she was
[1:21:22] extremely confident to the point that
[1:21:23] she couldn't keep quiet
[1:21:25] and I felt like I had that same issue
[1:21:27] and man I was thinking I was being
[1:21:29] confident it was prayed
[1:21:31] it was real prayed and I told God about
[1:21:34] blessings that you're supposed to give
[1:21:36] me if this is the problem then take it
[1:21:39] away I left it at that but when I think
[1:21:42] it was Pastor Isaac he talked about
[1:21:44] Pride
[1:21:45] I felt like it's still there
[1:21:48] he talked about fear I thought I wasn't
[1:21:50] scared
[1:21:51] but in 2019 at school we had a Christmas
[1:21:55] production
[1:21:56] and they said that everyone is going to
[1:21:59] come in black jeans
[1:22:01] and for that as in the choir they say
[1:22:04] black jeans and a plain white T-shirt
[1:22:08] and by genes I'm not talking about jeans
[1:22:10] Cuts I mean Jean trousers
[1:22:13] and I don't wear trousers
[1:22:16] so in my mind I was thinking of Naman I
[1:22:18] was like what part of Norman so I told
[1:22:21] my mom they said changing trousers
[1:22:25] but maybe we can ask God for a pattern
[1:22:29] I I was the only one at school who did
[1:22:31] not wear trousers and I was the only
[1:22:33] believer you know at least you can just
[1:22:35] find a Pentecostal to identify with who
[1:22:37] doesn't wear trousers but as the only
[1:22:40] person
[1:22:43] so
[1:22:44] somehow my mom talks to the principal
[1:22:46] and they get me a long black skirt
[1:22:49] but let me tell you ever since that
[1:22:52] moment I felt mentally tortured I wanted
[1:22:55] to skip that that production I really
[1:22:58] wanted to skip it and then the principle
[1:23:00] comes and gives me a prayer role at the
[1:23:02] end
[1:23:03] as look like I'm not going to my mom so
[1:23:05] that I can stay at home and ask me why
[1:23:07] didn't you come and I give them some
[1:23:09] funny excuse
[1:23:11] but in the principle says oh we want you
[1:23:13] to pray at the end of the production
[1:23:15] because it was like a Christian School
[1:23:18] so I couldn't skip to make matters worse
[1:23:20] God made sure that the principal's
[1:23:22] daughter
[1:23:23] your man looked at me
[1:23:25] with this face and told me they say
[1:23:29] trousers
[1:23:32] and though she emphasizes
[1:23:35] I remember that time they say pants
[1:23:37] say trousers like I don't know what they
[1:23:40] are
[1:23:42] honestly look at my girlfriends they
[1:23:45] looked like they were they had so many
[1:23:46] questions that they didn't want to show
[1:23:48] at me they kept on complimenting my
[1:23:50] skirt but let me tell you I didn't enjoy
[1:23:51] that I didn't enjoy it at all
[1:23:54] to make matters worse what if it comes
[1:23:56] you go back to school and they said they
[1:23:58] are going to change their uniform
[1:23:59] security from doesn't fit you can come
[1:24:01] in casual wear until they fix the
[1:24:03] uniform so everyone is coming casual and
[1:24:05] you're the only one in trousers I know
[1:24:07] casual wear children want to show off I
[1:24:10] don't really think that was in their
[1:24:11] agenda but they were all in trousers who
[1:24:14] are extensive and a principal to say no
[1:24:16] trousers above your knees because there
[1:24:17] are kids who come in Petras
[1:24:19] their kids would come in crop tops and
[1:24:22] you really think how can children do
[1:24:24] this and you're the only one in skirts
[1:24:26] and to make matters whilst they would
[1:24:28] ask you why don't you wear trousers
[1:24:31] and I do know what to tell them because
[1:24:33] they're scared I do want to offend them
[1:24:34] I don't want to confuse them
[1:24:37] and I was mentally tortured
[1:24:41] I wear skirts all the time and like I
[1:24:43] only had two skirts that I knew I could
[1:24:45] wear to school
[1:24:47] and they're all going short
[1:24:50] and I remember time I stopped wearing my
[1:24:52] spots where I used to wear my sports
[1:24:53] were shot with mainly from Scott and
[1:24:55] they asked me why aren't you wearing
[1:24:56] your sports wear what your sports wear
[1:24:58] Skies like the short skirts a Canon
[1:25:02] primary way like you have shorts but
[1:25:03] they're skirts they asked me why aren't
[1:25:05] you wearing them and I say that they
[1:25:07] were short and asked me how short and I
[1:25:10] told them like yeah
[1:25:12] and they said ah
[1:25:14] what's happening yes in here or maybe
[1:25:16] even higher
[1:25:19] because they are like I can't walk out
[1:25:21] of the getting a Patra and I looked at
[1:25:24] them
[1:25:26] and
[1:25:27] but I want to thank God because later on
[1:25:30] the uniform turned out to be trousers
[1:25:35] but because they let the high schoolers
[1:25:38] like just what they wanted because I
[1:25:40] think the principal wanted them to be
[1:25:42] free or something of that sort
[1:25:44] and I was the only one of course who
[1:25:46] doesn't wear trousers the uniform
[1:25:48] it turned out to be trousers
[1:25:51] and my mom again had to talk to the
[1:25:54] principal and mine turned out to be
[1:25:56] scared and at that point I was I was
[1:25:59] beginning to recover
[1:26:01] from that torture
[1:26:03] and then they said they only from his
[1:26:05] cut so somehow I just take a deep breath
[1:26:07] and I'm like God we're going to go
[1:26:09] through this together
[1:26:10] like as they could if you squeeze hands
[1:26:13] I think I need to feel you squeezing
[1:26:14] mine
[1:26:15] to like hold me tight so that can go
[1:26:18] through this because I don't get pushed
[1:26:20] at this time let's do this together and
[1:26:24] so
[1:26:26] like they they talk to my mom and they
[1:26:29] first give me my my sweater
[1:26:31] they give me my sweater and my friends
[1:26:33] are like because at this point they're
[1:26:35] only I don't wear trousers and I think
[1:26:37] they gave up asking me because every
[1:26:38] time they ask me I'll give them
[1:26:40] different answers I don't do our
[1:26:42] trousers until this one something else
[1:26:44] and you told the add-ons I finally had
[1:26:46] upset would be that lie that it's my
[1:26:49] parents
[1:26:51] and I knew for real even if my parents
[1:26:53] were not around I wouldn't wear them so
[1:26:55] I I planned on blaming it on them
[1:26:59] but finally I knew that was wrong
[1:27:03] so if they would ask me if I don't know
[1:27:05] what to tell them I'd rather keep quiet
[1:27:07] or find a way to go around it but I
[1:27:09] wouldn't lie
[1:27:11] I decided to stand with it
[1:27:13] so I've been forgotten where I was
[1:27:16] yes that's the jumper part
[1:27:19] so I get I get my sweater and they come
[1:27:22] out oh you're kidding
[1:27:26] okay so like here I come with all these
[1:27:29] questions like I noticed I was still
[1:27:32] scared that experience there's a way it
[1:27:34] broke me that if I went back to school I
[1:27:37] would still hide my faith
[1:27:39] and he talked about fear I thought fear
[1:27:42] was not talking to me but I stood there
[1:27:45] I think it was maybe this morning I
[1:27:48] noticed that I'm actually scared
[1:27:50] I told God I'm scared I need you to make
[1:27:53] me bold
[1:27:54] and this morning I was talking to her
[1:27:56] sister she told me no Abigail you have
[1:27:58] to be strong you have to testify you
[1:28:01] have to tell them that truth like this
[1:28:03] time I'm going back to school
[1:28:05] I'm not going to hide my faith I'm meant
[1:28:08] to be bold
[1:28:09] even if they ask me questions
[1:28:12] I'll tell them the truth I won't hide
[1:28:15] why I don't wear trousers
[1:28:17] I won't hide why I don't wear short
[1:28:19] skirts
[1:28:21] I'll tell them the truth
[1:28:23] and I thank God that he has delivered me
[1:28:26] from Pride
[1:28:28] and thank God that I'm not scared
[1:28:31] anymore
[1:28:36] [Applause]
[1:28:39] God bless you
[1:28:42] these are all wonderful testimonies
[1:28:45] now
[1:28:46] I I understand and we really want to
[1:28:48] hear everything on the background that
[1:28:51] has led to what God has done for you but
[1:28:54] because of time and because of more
[1:28:56] people here that wants to testify I'm
[1:28:59] going to request you to just hit the
[1:29:01] point I came to the meetings the Lord
[1:29:04] has done this for me is that okay
[1:29:08] amen can I call Brother mukisha Dania
[1:29:20] God bless his Saints
[1:29:23] I thank God
[1:29:25] for I'm here
[1:29:27] and I thank God for the ministry
[1:29:30] yeah my my testimony is
[1:29:34] I didn't have money to come
[1:29:37] to this conversion
[1:29:39] by the Lord provided away
[1:29:42] and uh
[1:29:44] I was I was talking to our pastor
[1:29:48] in ginger so you told me that he's going
[1:29:51] to come I didn't plan it that I didn't
[1:29:54] know that he was coming to the youth
[1:29:55] convention but he told me he was coming
[1:29:58] so
[1:30:00] he said we can't go together in the
[1:30:02] morning
[1:30:04] he brought me up this place
[1:30:06] paid for me everything
[1:30:09] I thank God for that
[1:30:12] and another thing I thank God that he
[1:30:17] has delivered me out of I I don't know I
[1:30:21] can explain it
[1:30:22] but when pastor called that uh some used
[1:30:26] to come here
[1:30:28] the ones that really feel a burden of
[1:30:31] ministering
[1:30:32] I really fear talking to come to the
[1:30:35] congregation
[1:30:36] but I said Lord
[1:30:41] have my life
[1:30:44] even if I fear top people I I at times I
[1:30:48] fear talking to people like a big
[1:30:50] congregation like this one I really fear
[1:30:53] so I said how will I do it I feel the
[1:30:56] fear inside me
[1:30:58] I said but there's some things that came
[1:31:01] to my mind
[1:31:02] I said by the minister is not all about
[1:31:05] coming to the pulpit
[1:31:07] so you see our minister of God in any
[1:31:10] way
[1:31:11] yeah God bless amen
[1:31:15] Hallelujah
[1:31:17] that that sister what's your name sister
[1:31:19] Lydia
[1:31:21] are you Lydia
[1:31:22] Our Sister Abigail
[1:31:25] what your point
[1:31:28] you taught us a lot a lot that was
[1:31:30] building up to this
[1:31:32] but I trust that many got your point you
[1:31:36] see are you able to take a stand when
[1:31:38] you are at school
[1:31:40] because this is a very important thing
[1:31:42] do you know that you find yourself in a
[1:31:44] situation when you are the only believer
[1:31:46] when you are the only one that has to
[1:31:48] take a stand and say I do not wear
[1:31:50] trousers or I don't wear short skirts
[1:31:52] Believers these days I begin to wear a
[1:31:54] mini secrets
[1:31:56] foreign
[1:32:00] Believers of the message shame on you if
[1:32:02] you do that it means you do not know
[1:32:04] what you believe
[1:32:05] I believe you should be able to take a
[1:32:07] stand and tell your friends I don't do
[1:32:10] that
[1:32:11] why because I'm a Christian
[1:32:14] but I'm a Christian too no I'm a
[1:32:16] different kind of Christian
[1:32:19] they will want to know what type of
[1:32:21] Christian you are and then you will lead
[1:32:22] them to church
[1:32:24] that's what we have to do so sister that
[1:32:28] boldness you have received here today
[1:32:29] take it and it will spread like wildfire
[1:32:31] in your school
[1:32:34] brother Daniel I believe that fear has
[1:32:36] gone he just spoke
[1:32:38] you just spoke so that fear is gone
[1:32:40] amen God just gave you boldness too
[1:32:43] amen
[1:32:44] um brother Daniel I love the way you
[1:32:46] kept it so short and precise to the
[1:32:48] point everybody else you like that
[1:32:51] okay so uh sister fortunate
[1:33:01] [Applause]
[1:33:04] praise God Church
[1:33:06] I thought so much for these meetings and
[1:33:11] all the ministers and everyone who came
[1:33:15] I thank God so much who he has delivered
[1:33:18] me most of the times we pray and
[1:33:21] ask ourselves before we
[1:33:24] we fail to forgive ourselves
[1:33:26] you're praying and the devil is telling
[1:33:29] you your sin now you
[1:33:32] know I remember my brother Polly Cup who
[1:33:34] are praying sometime and he said
[1:33:36] sometimes the devil lies to you a sinner
[1:33:39] but today I prayed and I feel I'm free
[1:33:44] you pray and you feel your prayers are
[1:33:47] not going but I feel I'm free and I I
[1:33:50] believe it's finished
[1:33:52] whatever I've not got today my faith
[1:33:55] says it's finished and I'm going to get
[1:33:58] it
[1:33:59] as I end I urge all the youth to keep
[1:34:04] praying we it is finished it's finished
[1:34:08] but keep praying
[1:34:10] yes and the ministers should also keep
[1:34:13] praying for us when you are there out
[1:34:16] there and in here
[1:34:19] prayer prayer prayer is important
[1:34:24] amen

[1:34:39] yes I'm calling you
[1:34:54] thank you Pastor God bless you Church
[1:34:58] I thank God for all of you
[1:35:01] everything thank God for
[1:35:04] my life
[1:35:08] first of all I thank God for these
[1:35:11] meetings
[1:35:12] by the grace of the by the grace of God
[1:35:15] I've been on the organizing committee as
[1:35:18] a vice chairperson but I've seen the
[1:35:20] hand of God in this
[1:35:24] we prepared these meetings on a short
[1:35:26] note
[1:35:28] but
[1:35:30] I've seen goddess hand the first prayer
[1:35:33] for this meeting when I was in my room I
[1:35:36] prayed God
[1:35:38] because we we did not have enough food
[1:35:42] and the projection was was about 100
[1:35:45] people but we are overwhelmed by about
[1:35:48] 300 people so we did not have enough
[1:35:50] food I pray remember that prayer I told
[1:35:55] God that you who fed them altitude with
[1:35:58] the five bread and two fish you're going
[1:36:00] to feed our youth to our coming
[1:36:04] and I've been in the kitchen I've seen
[1:36:07] that God has blessed us we have faith
[1:36:10] our visitors and I'm happy for that I
[1:36:14] thank God so much
[1:36:15] [Applause]
[1:36:20] I so got this hand when I was speaking
[1:36:22] to service providers
[1:36:24] from from those who supplied as water
[1:36:27] the chairs the attained where we're
[1:36:31] buying meat where we were buying milk
[1:36:34] from they were just easy and simple and
[1:36:38] giving us no hardship
[1:36:42] so I thank God so much even the cooks
[1:36:44] they never had in our life so I thank
[1:36:47] God so much another testimony I have I
[1:36:51] work in a printing company where we I
[1:36:55] import I'm the procurement of this and I
[1:36:57] import uh substrates papers from from
[1:37:01] from from China and other other
[1:37:04] countries so when I went to my new job
[1:37:07] in agar in September I found an ongoing
[1:37:11] procurement of about 170 rolls of
[1:37:15] substrates
[1:37:16] but
[1:37:18] the supply and the shipping company told
[1:37:21] us that the expected time of arrival of
[1:37:24] those substrates will be 16th January
[1:37:27] and they were
[1:37:30] this procurement took a lot of time
[1:37:32] because our supplier
[1:37:34] did not have enough qualification to
[1:37:37] pass the pivot certificate
[1:37:40] so I'm not explain the payback
[1:37:42] certificate it do not take time but you
[1:37:44] need it so if to prove that those goods
[1:37:48] you're bringing into our country are on
[1:37:52] of standard
[1:37:53] so it played for about three months to
[1:37:56] get that certificate but the boss has
[1:37:59] been on my neck so much the paper has
[1:38:03] crossed around just buying them from the
[1:38:05] supplier was about 150 million Uganda
[1:38:08] Shillings that's just buying uh shipping
[1:38:12] them to our country the shipper about
[1:38:14] six about about uh
[1:38:17] uh six thousand dollars just to ship
[1:38:21] taxes about 60 million so my boss has
[1:38:25] been on my neck he thought he told me in
[1:38:29] Uganda
[1:38:30] foreign
[1:38:37] get lost you also get lost I'll look for
[1:38:41] you
[1:38:42] so I've been on pressure now the
[1:38:45] challenge came that the shipper
[1:38:48] told me that Basics teams the assignment
[1:38:51] will be in Uganda but on the 16th it was
[1:38:54] still at the border being held because
[1:38:57] our business didn't had a problem and I
[1:39:00] had planned that by 16 I would be done
[1:39:02] by this pressure so that 19 is the
[1:39:05] meeting time I can be able to do my work
[1:39:09] but Saturn came in by 16th had not
[1:39:13] received these Goods even on Fifth on
[1:39:16] that day when I was supposed to ask for
[1:39:19] my leave I'm the one under organizing
[1:39:22] committee I emphasized that every every
[1:39:24] member of the committee should ask for a
[1:39:26] leave so that to be able to serve very
[1:39:29] well but me when I went to ask they
[1:39:31] leave they didn't Grant it they said you
[1:39:33] cannot how do you leave this world and
[1:39:36] and how do you how can you dedicate it
[1:39:39] this maturity so I thank God
[1:39:44] on Friday when I was working there in
[1:39:46] the kitchen I received a call and they
[1:39:48] told me your things are coming you need
[1:39:52] to be at work
[1:39:55] I use like a motorcycle they nearly
[1:39:57] knocked me because of that Consignment
[1:39:59] but I thank God on Saturday I officially
[1:40:02] received that Consignment and put it in
[1:40:04] store
[1:40:06] [Applause]
[1:40:10] every thank God for the preaching that
[1:40:12] has been going on I missed many of them
[1:40:16] especially brother either as reaching I
[1:40:20] when I was behind there I nearly I
[1:40:23] nearly stopped what I was doing to come
[1:40:25] and attend the meeting but I said again
[1:40:27] how will I come and people not eat
[1:40:33] that that something told me you're going
[1:40:36] to stream and you're going to to to be
[1:40:38] placed in the same way like those who
[1:40:40] were on the source
[1:40:42] I thank God so much I managed to attend
[1:40:44] brother Mike was two meetings I could
[1:40:47] come and sneak and then go back and go
[1:40:50] about so may the Lord bless you all may
[1:40:53] God bless the vessels of whom he has
[1:40:56] used
[1:40:59] may God bless you all
[1:41:02] and on behalf of the organizing
[1:41:03] committee I would like to say that in
[1:41:06] case there is anything which went wrong
[1:41:08] please forgive us
[1:41:10] may God bless you so much
[1:41:15] so I allowed him more time because he
[1:41:18] was supposed to speak earlier in the
[1:41:19] past service but they were not around
[1:41:22] but for the rest 2-2 minutes
[1:41:25] so if it hits two minutes I don't be
[1:41:28] offended when I stop you I think I have

[1:48:44] brother Pastor Isaac when he was
[1:48:46] ministering yesterday he spoke of this
[1:48:50] second stanza over when the battle is
[1:48:53] over
[1:48:54] and he was like um
[1:48:57] it was like um
[1:49:00] it says um must I be courage to the
[1:49:03] skies on flowery bedok East While others
[1:49:06] fought to win the praise and sailed
[1:49:09] through blood disease so he mentioned
[1:49:11] that and I remember there is a dream I
[1:49:14] had last year and I was singing We were
[1:49:18] singing in a youth meeting and for me I
[1:49:20] don't like attending youth meetings as
[1:49:22] such even rather Pastor was asked me you
[1:49:25] did you attend the Guyana meetings I was
[1:49:28] like no he was like you should be
[1:49:29] attending these meetings
[1:49:31] so and then I dreamed that I was in a
[1:49:35] youth meeting and we were singing that
[1:49:38] very song that Sam Sam's tanza and we
[1:49:43] were with the brother
[1:49:45] Moses
[1:49:47] who played the keyboard yesterday here
[1:49:50] and we were singing so that morning I
[1:49:52] texted him that was last year I was like
[1:49:54] you know I dreamed about you
[1:49:57] that we were singing the second stanza
[1:50:00] even the the dream is still here in my
[1:50:02] phone
[1:50:03] was like I dreamed about you that we
[1:50:06] were serious in a youth meeting singing
[1:50:09] this song or this second stance that
[1:50:12] emphasized on the second stanza and when
[1:50:14] brother Michael came here he also showed
[1:50:17] us that same stanza he said I printed
[1:50:20] this thing
[1:50:21] at my place Brad Isaac also printed his
[1:50:25] in his place but it is the same thing so
[1:50:28] then when when he spoke that and I
[1:50:32] remembered this dream and I texted him
[1:50:35] this evening I was like do you remember
[1:50:38] the Dream I Dreamed that's you know when
[1:50:42] a youth meeting and we're singing this
[1:50:44] song A circumstance of when the battle
[1:50:47] is over we shall wear a crown it was
[1:50:49] like ah how is that even possible then I
[1:50:52] resent for him that dream was like oh I
[1:50:54] remember but hey it is rare for me to
[1:50:56] even attend youth meeting so it was
[1:50:58] almost impossible for me so I was like
[1:51:01] oh thank you Lord you made it possible
[1:51:03] for me to attend and you saw me in this
[1:51:06] day that I'll be attending these youth
[1:51:08] meetings he has confirmed it for me and
[1:51:10] I thank God for it
[1:51:12] God bless you
[1:51:18] praise the Lord
[1:51:19] you see no one is here by mistake
[1:51:23] let me repeat that no one came to these
[1:51:26] meetings by mistake
[1:51:28] you see so whatever you had
[1:51:30] even what you are doubting that God did
[1:51:32] not do I want to assure you God has done
[1:51:36] if he saw you here then he did not come
[1:51:39] here by mistake or for nothing his
[1:51:41] purpose has been achieved and
[1:51:43] accomplished in your life
[1:51:45] there is this one who the last one just
[1:51:47] told me I request to testify but you
[1:51:50] didn't post your name so
[1:51:52] I don't know who you are
[1:51:54] I think one of you young men gave me
[1:51:55] this paper is from who
[1:51:58] oh you just wanted me to
[1:52:03] God what's your name sister I'm Sir John
[1:52:09] um I wrote badshit but
[1:52:12] when you read that changed my mother
[1:52:14] like I'm not going to testify now like
[1:52:16] it's good I didn't put that name so now
[1:52:19] when I said we are going to investigate
[1:52:21] I'm like oh God I'll be a good half just
[1:52:23] come here
[1:52:25] meeting
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:31] I want to thank God for the Holy Ghost
[1:52:33] baptism he has granted unto me
[1:52:37] um
[1:52:38] and when we came in this service the
[1:52:41] pastor preached about hindrances
[1:52:47] something that okay like he talked about
[1:52:50] small things say that times we consider
[1:52:53] some things to be small so you overlook
[1:52:55] them saying it's a small one then he
[1:52:58] gave an example and said in case you are
[1:52:59] having he gave some weeds
[1:53:02] it is she gave down that was some small
[1:53:05] weights but then he said you keep moving
[1:53:07] you keep moving you're in Uganda by the
[1:53:09] time you reach Kenya
[1:53:11] for example there is a steep he gave an
[1:53:13] example of mountain
[1:53:16] s
[1:53:18] so was like however little that way it
[1:53:21] might be by the time you reach there it
[1:53:24] will be very hard for you to claim that
[1:53:26] step so I had a I I I thank God that the
[1:53:30] Lord saved me I had like some small
[1:53:34] hindrance
[1:53:36] the star first for me I started from a
[1:53:39] message School the pastor preaches
[1:53:41] you're not supposed to have boyfriends
[1:53:44] they're not supposed to to engage in a
[1:53:46] relationship so I I believe this as like
[1:53:49] yes you are not supposed but there is a
[1:53:51] way
[1:53:52] like
[1:53:53] and like the whole thing I don't involve
[1:53:55] I cannot fall into fornication let me
[1:53:58] keep it at that pace
[1:54:00] so the brother is a Brotherhood I don't
[1:54:03] know that it was brother brother Isaac
[1:54:05] he gave an exam there's a brother in his
[1:54:07] church no it was in the morning the
[1:54:10] brother said
[1:54:12] he told the brother the brother told him
[1:54:14] for me I attacked the devil slowly I
[1:54:18] don't I don't rush so I was like
[1:54:22] so now the brother said by the time
[1:54:24] right now that the brother left the
[1:54:25] church he fell into fornication so it
[1:54:28] had been a bad thing to me every time
[1:54:29] because every time they preach it but
[1:54:32] for me there's a way I don't I didn't I
[1:54:34] didn't open up myself to let it forsake
[1:54:38] everyone like to live all over them so
[1:54:43] every time you feel like you're going to
[1:54:44] leave this one
[1:54:46] you're like okay one deeper I'm not
[1:54:48] supposed to like for the world that for
[1:54:50] a second I've left but again they're
[1:54:52] like even Believers it's I'm still
[1:54:55] standing they're like you that stuff
[1:54:57] it's nonsense so
[1:54:59] really in this service the Lord has
[1:55:01] given me a great Victory he has
[1:55:05] delivered in my life I'm free I'm free
[1:55:08] from all that I'm not there's no bondage
[1:55:12] holding me
[1:55:14] that was a small Hindus but time came it
[1:55:17] was Heavy I was still living in british
[1:55:19] talking about it I thought I I thought I
[1:55:22] had left those things like I thought I
[1:55:24] don't involve I have no boyfriend but
[1:55:26] they start seeing
[1:55:28] you don't tell that person boldly Who
[1:55:31] You Are
[1:55:32] so anyway thank God for the delivery
[1:55:42] amen
[1:55:44] God bless you all I greet you in the
[1:55:47] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I request
[1:55:49] you to pray for my mother she called Ali
[1:55:52] this morning saying she feels uh burning
[1:55:55] under her feet and she feels a lot of
[1:55:58] body weakness and I believe by your
[1:56:00] prayers she
[1:56:02] uh can receive instant healing now this
[1:56:06] is Sister faith I don't know whether
[1:56:07] she's the one who came here
[1:56:10] okay is your mother still sick
[1:56:14] she she's now well
[1:56:18] I'm talking to another one
[1:56:20] she's now well yes
[1:56:24] amen
[1:56:30] um then this uh
[1:56:34] Oh Sister Irene saying she wrote a paper
[1:56:37] but it did not reach me so whatever you
[1:56:40] put it forgive them
[1:56:42] but God has remembered you so you come
[1:56:44] and be the last
[1:56:48] [Applause]
[1:56:50] praise God brethren
[1:56:53] I was really going to miss this chance
[1:56:55] uh my very first testimony
[1:56:59] it's about our lunch time
[1:57:02] as we were having lunch ahead
[1:57:05] people saying that oh God this food is
[1:57:08] not going to be enough
[1:57:10] uh people are so many already on the
[1:57:13] line and more are coming
[1:57:15] I think I shared this testimony with
[1:57:17] sister Judith yeah she's right there
[1:57:20] and I sat down and I told God please
[1:57:23] feed us like multiply this food
[1:57:27] and to my surprise and for you who are
[1:57:30] there you know we ate food
[1:57:32] to a moment that they call people to get
[1:57:35] more food
[1:57:37] yes
[1:57:41] yeah maybe the brother who said this
[1:57:44] didn't know that someone had him but I
[1:57:46] had had him
[1:57:48] and I had to pray to God I thank him
[1:57:50] that you really fed us we didn't know
[1:57:53] what you went through to give us the
[1:57:54] food but I thank God that
[1:57:56] we all got satisfied
[1:57:58] and my testimony for these meetings
[1:58:03] it is very very first time to attend
[1:58:06] youth meetings you know he is at him
[1:58:08] that certain meetings
[1:58:10] and all that but
[1:58:13] my testimony would be so long but I'm
[1:58:15] trying to figure out how to shorten it
[1:58:18] uh my testimony really started when
[1:58:22] Pastor Jose
[1:58:25] preached in the set of conventions about
[1:58:27] having an encounter with good
[1:58:30] but I understood that someone
[1:58:33] that I got patience in my mind that were
[1:58:36] not answered as they could what should I
[1:58:39] do I'm supposed to meet you but I don't
[1:58:42] know how I'm going to do this of course
[1:58:44] there are so many faults in my life it's
[1:58:47] me alone who knows
[1:58:50] the behind of the sins of my life I will
[1:58:54] not go to prove that
[1:58:55] but I really asked God to show me what
[1:58:58] to do
[1:59:00] uh of course I put up some things
[1:59:02] between that someone like between the
[1:59:06] moment of that sermon
[1:59:08] till Friday of this
[1:59:11] meeting
[1:59:13] but still I felt it was not
[1:59:16] finished
[1:59:18] I felt there was something that I was
[1:59:21] still lagging on to that I had to really
[1:59:24] put off
[1:59:27] um
[1:59:28] you know I was growing girls we go
[1:59:30] through so many things sometimes we even
[1:59:32] get so embarrassed to talk about them I
[1:59:36] know someone out there is also speaking
[1:59:39] the same thing as I'm saying but uh when
[1:59:42] I came to this meeting
[1:59:44] just to tell you shortly I was the one
[1:59:46] mobilizing the youths in my church that
[1:59:49] is evening light brighter
[1:59:51] is Judge but trust me I didn't have the
[1:59:54] money
[1:59:55] I was receiving people's money I didn't
[1:59:58] have any coin on me I only had 3 000
[2:00:01] Shillings in my bag
[2:00:03] and someone mocked me was like you're
[2:00:06] the one mobilizing for this but you've
[2:00:08] not yet paid I was like ah good thing
[2:00:09] I'm giving the money to me so I will
[2:00:11] just take it
[2:00:12] and then I remembered
[2:00:15] the timer was that there was a time I
[2:00:17] was to Nairobi I'd kept some Kenyan
[2:00:20] shillings on me
[2:00:23] it was almost 2 000 Kenyan shillings I
[2:00:27] remembered this money I have it in my
[2:00:30] drawer I got the money I exchanged it
[2:00:33] very very fast and that's how I ended up
[2:00:36] coming here with a p a feature faith and
[2:00:39] I'm grateful about that then with the
[2:00:41] questions that I had kept from the
[2:00:43] encounter with God
[2:00:45] I'm really grateful those questions have
[2:00:47] been answered
[2:00:49] I'm a person
[2:00:52] I met a child by a profession but at my
[2:00:55] person who likes keeping young I don't
[2:00:57] know I'm not so old
[2:01:00] uh but I was keeping young in the wrong
[2:01:03] way
[2:01:04] I'm not ashamed to say this
[2:01:07] I'm a person who is on tick tock
[2:01:10] you know when they were talking about
[2:01:12] this I looked at these people talking to
[2:01:14] me as if they were
[2:01:17] in my phone
[2:01:21] you know
[2:01:22] I sometimes sleep very late but on tick
[2:01:26] tock
[2:01:27] sometimes by this time me I'm awake you
[2:01:29] know but I'm on tick tock like
[2:01:34] it's really hard to say it out
[2:01:36] I'm either on tick tock
[2:01:39] or on a call with a very wrong
[2:01:42] individual
[2:01:44] yes
[2:01:46] so I really thank good for these
[2:01:48] meetings
[2:01:49] because there is a special way I feel
[2:01:52] right now like there is a way I feel
[2:01:55] like
[2:01:56] erasing everything in my phone of course
[2:01:59] there are no dirty things but I feel I
[2:02:02] should have a new phone like new
[2:02:05] contacts
[2:02:06] near everything and I know
[2:02:10] there is some other person that is going
[2:02:13] through the certain thing as I was
[2:02:15] mobilizing you it's in my church there
[2:02:18] is a gentleman I called he has daughters
[2:02:21] that I expected to be here but they
[2:02:23] didn't make it but before I even told
[2:02:26] you my reason for the call he was like
[2:02:28] Irene
[2:02:30] you're wasting a lot of time I was like
[2:02:33] how hey
[2:02:35] how why is this the first thing you're
[2:02:37] telling me
[2:02:38] so on my way to the convention is I was
[2:02:42] asking myself how am I wasting time like
[2:02:46] how am I wasting time he told me broadly
[2:02:48] you're supposed to be married by this
[2:02:50] time
[2:02:51] before before they got married they used
[2:02:54] to go to mountains and prayer I was like
[2:02:56] we don't have those things anymore how
[2:02:58] am I wasting time like what should I do
[2:03:01] but trust me Believers I now know who I
[2:03:06] am I now know what I'm supposed to do I
[2:03:09] now know how I've been wasting all this
[2:03:12] time I now know that I'm really sad and
[2:03:15] I've met my encounter with God it's a
[2:03:19] lengthy but let me stop it at that I
[2:03:22] really thank God for pasta and the
[2:03:24] ministers may God richly bless you uh my
[2:03:28] testimony when I told it was very long
[2:03:34] when he was telling us to write oh that
[2:03:38] we shall testify I was like uh-uh I
[2:03:41] don't have any testimony
[2:03:43] and I remember him saying it will be a
[2:03:45] testimony for some of you to testify and
[2:03:49] sincerely speaking it is a testimony
[2:03:52] that
[2:03:53] I got a testimony to testify unto the
[2:03:57] Lord may God richly bless you
[2:04:00] amen
[2:04:03] God bless you Sister Irene
[2:04:07] there are some
[2:04:09] how many here how many here
[2:04:12] don't worry I've asked you a lot of
[2:04:13] questions this is the last one how many
[2:04:15] here have smartphones
[2:04:18] smartphones
[2:04:19] no it's a SmartPhone looks like this to
[2:04:21] some of you who don't know
[2:04:23] a smartphone looks like this
[2:04:25] just raise up your hand if you have a
[2:04:27] smartphone how many don't
[2:04:31] okay but you have a phone now to those
[2:04:35] of you who have smartphones
[2:04:37] you you've had a testimony of Sister
[2:04:39] Irene
[2:04:40] now
[2:04:43] I thank God that I started these matters
[2:04:47] of relationship and Court courtship
[2:04:50] before
[2:04:52] WhatsApp was invented
[2:04:56] but I know we've not talked about these
[2:04:59] things and people came expecting us talk
[2:05:01] about them
[2:05:02] but what what you had was much more
[2:05:04] important than us talking about those
[2:05:06] things because you you've had the Holy
[2:05:09] Spirit was already doing the work
[2:05:11] and I believe also he has done in some
[2:05:13] of your lives
[2:05:14] so you see what I was saying is
[2:05:17] we used to write letters if you had the
[2:05:19] love of your life and you love them so
[2:05:21] much you write a letter and you know you
[2:05:23] make sure you use a very good
[2:05:24] handwriting and you know you draw some
[2:05:27] hearts on there and so you like make the
[2:05:30] letter very appealing to her eyes so
[2:05:32] that she can give you a response and you
[2:05:35] even put some tears maybe you say you
[2:05:37] see this
[2:05:38] now some of you don't know those things
[2:05:40] because you have WhatsApp now this was
[2:05:45] good but at that time for you to do that
[2:05:48] even to write a letter and send it
[2:05:50] it would be very difficult very
[2:05:53] difficult if you especially if you're a
[2:05:55] Believer it would be very difficult
[2:05:57] you you know there is a lot of process
[2:05:59] involved to write that to to get the
[2:06:02] paper to get the the good pain to write
[2:06:05] to put Power your heart sit down think
[2:06:07] about what you are going to write you
[2:06:09] know you know make sure you are your
[2:06:11] hands are dry and there's a lot of
[2:06:13] process and then you sit down and begin
[2:06:16] to put yourself in the mood of writing
[2:06:18] and then you begin writing and then you
[2:06:20] have to find someone to give that letter
[2:06:21] to check with the person you are sending
[2:06:23] it to and you have to make sure that
[2:06:24] person is faithful does not look at the
[2:06:26] letter you know the process was so long
[2:06:28] so that by the time by the time you
[2:06:31] think about the whole thing just change
[2:06:32] your mind I will not write the letter
[2:06:34] after all
[2:06:35] but nowadays with this Smartphone in
[2:06:38] just one minute
[2:06:39] you you have sent you have sent and
[2:06:42] received messages not only messages
[2:06:44] pictures not only pictures videos
[2:06:48] and you find the devil actually taking
[2:06:50] over your lives let me tell you these
[2:06:52] smartphones can actually take you to
[2:06:54] hell if you're not careful
[2:06:55] because the things that come on there if
[2:06:58] you don't filter it some of the groups
[2:06:59] that you are in actually some of you
[2:07:01] should make a decision to leave them
[2:07:02] before you leave this place
[2:07:04] before you leave your hostel in the
[2:07:06] morning make a decision to leave some of
[2:07:08] those groups you are in those groups you
[2:07:10] are like okay I'm a Believer but this
[2:07:11] one is a group of my friends and but the
[2:07:13] things they are posting there are
[2:07:15] influencing your life in a negative way
[2:07:16] why do you keep there okay sister why do
[2:07:19] you keep chatting you know with the 10
[2:07:21] Brothers at the same time are you going
[2:07:22] to marry all of them
[2:07:24] sincerely think about it
[2:07:26] so to me I think
[2:07:28] um that's why sisters brothers can
[2:07:30] propose to sisters and at the end of the
[2:07:32] day the sister is not accepting to
[2:07:35] accept any of them because she's not too
[2:07:37] sure who is the best among them but if
[2:07:39] you are if you are speaking to someone
[2:07:41] who has gone through the right channel
[2:07:42] your pastor your father you know and
[2:07:45] you're speaking to them then at least
[2:07:46] you get a chance to get to know them and
[2:07:49] them alone and then make a decision not
[2:07:52] based on influence so I don't think this
[2:07:55] thing of courting or it's not even
[2:07:56] cutting I think it is um what's the one
[2:07:59] dating I don't believe Believers that
[2:08:01] should debt believe I shouldn't debt
[2:08:05] you're not talking to me but I believe
[2:08:07] Believers shouldn't date but Believers
[2:08:09] should Court
[2:08:10] and courtship involves courtship is done
[2:08:13] in the light it's not done in the
[2:08:14] darkness under the butcher it's done in
[2:08:16] the light when you when your father
[2:08:18] knows if you especially if your father
[2:08:19] even if your father is not a Believer
[2:08:21] your father must know what is happening
[2:08:23] in your life sister especially if you're
[2:08:25] still living under his roof
[2:08:28] did you know that if you make a vow your
[2:08:30] father can allow that vow so it's very
[2:08:32] important for you to keep in to be in
[2:08:35] the light at least if you're not so
[2:08:36] close to your father and he's not a
[2:08:37] Believer unless you can confide in your
[2:08:39] pastor and make sure you are walking in
[2:08:41] the light that I think sister I read
[2:08:42] that Testament was very good some of you
[2:08:44] need to make decisions to wipe your
[2:08:46] phone or maybe do it a factory reset and
[2:08:49] start over again
[2:08:51] praise the name of the Lord well it's
[2:08:54] almost midnight I shouldn't preach as
[2:08:55] someone
[2:08:56] uh brother brother Enoch has a testimony
[2:08:59] and so I uh I'm going to no I'm not
[2:09:03] receiving any more papers
[2:09:05] it's almost midnight I I don't know how
[2:09:07] many papers are those
[2:09:12] I just said I'm not receiving but I just
[2:09:24] but I just remembered God is gracious
[2:09:29] okay let me read this it seems this is a
[2:09:31] testament which is written
[2:09:36] this pastor read for me
[2:09:50] I do not exactly understand when I read
[2:09:52] alone so let me read it out aloud and
[2:09:54] see
[2:09:55] please Pastor read for me I think he's
[2:09:57] trying to say read my testimony
[2:10:01] this is Sister John from YMCA I think
[2:10:04] evening light bright Tabernacle I lost
[2:10:07] my sister and mother and job
[2:10:10] sorry
[2:10:12] most of most importantly that I learned
[2:10:15] in the what I learned in this meeting
[2:10:17] the devil wants me to be with their weak
[2:10:20] and falling down
[2:10:22] but I'm going to trust in God and finish
[2:10:24] it in Jesus name
[2:10:27] amen
[2:10:31] sister Joanne may God give you Grace
[2:10:33] especially through this time of loss and
[2:10:36] give you strength indeed you finish it
[2:10:38] by his grace
[2:10:40] um this is uh or Kitty Richard has a
[2:10:43] testimony I'm going to give you exactly
[2:10:44] one minute I'll count it right here so
[2:10:46] come
[2:10:47] and please no more no more writing no
[2:10:49] more writing I think that's that's more
[2:10:51] than enough
[2:10:52] for a night
[2:10:55] okay the brothers can give you the
[2:10:57] microphone
[2:10:59] bless your Saints
[2:11:02] thank God for his grace and mercies that
[2:11:05] has brought me through
[2:11:10] thank him for bringing me all this far I
[2:11:13] did not know that I was going to be here
[2:11:15] this day
[2:11:18] I thank him so much for what he has done
[2:11:21] for me
[2:11:23] there is
[2:11:25] okay spirit that was disturbing me
[2:11:29] when I come like to church and I pray it
[2:11:32] leaves me but when I go back home
[2:11:36] and I
[2:11:38] stopped meditating upon the word of God
[2:11:42] it comes back again
[2:11:46] then now when I came to this place this
[2:11:48] when I realized the trick of the devil
[2:11:52] when I stopped meditating upon the word
[2:11:55] of God for it it comes back
[2:11:58] then after I just remembered what the
[2:12:01] pastor taught us some time back last
[2:12:04] year I think
[2:12:07] you don't remember very well but you say
[2:12:09] that
[2:12:11] when there is
[2:12:13] when you have seen in you when you have
[2:12:15] sinned
[2:12:18] you cannot receive now the Holy Spirit
[2:12:21] unless you first repent
[2:12:24] you cannot get a bottle full of juice
[2:12:26] and maybe full of something like that do
[2:12:30] it so what or what and you want to pour
[2:12:32] again another thing you have to fast
[2:12:34] forward that one in the bottle out and
[2:12:36] you empty the bottom they has got to be
[2:12:38] emptying out then after you fill in
[2:12:41] something there
[2:12:44] so I learned that it was the same to us
[2:12:46] when we want to receive the Holy Spirit
[2:12:50] that he was Spirit as God first get out
[2:12:52] of us then the Holy Spirit be replaced
[2:12:56] right there
[2:12:58] so that thing really touched me and I
[2:13:00] just remembered it
[2:13:03] and it was my prayer to the Lord
[2:13:07] and he had my prayer
[2:13:10] on
[2:13:15] believed it that though it was led even
[2:13:18] if I then I only one day the Lord will
[2:13:20] hear my prayer
[2:13:23] he will do
[2:13:25] what I am expecting him to do I will
[2:13:28] receive what I'm expecting to receive
[2:13:31] I really thank God so much that he had
[2:13:34] my prayer and he took that Spirit out of
[2:13:37] me
[2:13:38] and bless the Holy Spirit right with me
[2:13:41] I thank God the Lord bless you
[2:13:46] [Applause]
[2:13:48] God bless you
[2:13:50] amen I know where to start but I want to
[2:13:53] be so brief
[2:13:54] first of all I want to thank God for
[2:13:56] brother usowozzi amen he invited me to
[2:14:00] the convention and I've been so blessed
[2:14:03] to come and put my shoulder to the wheel
[2:14:06] and to see that the convention is so a
[2:14:08] success
[2:14:09] amen now my testimony is this uh like
[2:14:12] everybody of you have been praying like
[2:14:16] for many things I will not tell you
[2:14:19] uh many things
[2:14:22] like in my life so until uh actually
[2:14:25] there's someone you preaching said an
[2:14:27] encounter with God it is on YouTube if
[2:14:30] you could find it
[2:14:31] it was it was a blessing so uh
[2:14:35] he preached a message and also brother
[2:14:37] Arthur on your Pudu he was talking about
[2:14:41] Jacob and wrestling
[2:14:43] so brother Arthur was talking about
[2:14:46] Jacob
[2:14:48] drawing a line and telling God that God
[2:14:51] you're not crossing here until you bless
[2:14:53] me
[2:14:54] so and then his sermon I'll not go to
[2:14:58] the sermon now I've been
[2:14:59] praying for a long time for many things
[2:15:03] about the ministry about
[2:15:06] let me tell you marriage
[2:15:08] you get it
[2:15:11] and then don't laugh
[2:15:14] and
[2:15:15] yeah so blessings are at work and
[2:15:19] different things challenges you know so
[2:15:22] when I came to the convention
[2:15:25] I had some like a desire in my life that
[2:15:29] God should do something as this year
[2:15:31] starts actually I told God that this
[2:15:33] year is my year
[2:15:36] yeah so before the convention I came I
[2:15:39] met brother bass booster Jose okay that
[2:15:42] was a short form as and you know he has
[2:15:45] testimonies and he talks about this and
[2:15:47] that so one of the days when we're at
[2:15:51] his home having a meal as
[2:15:55] I'm lucky to sit with the ministers you
[2:15:57] know
[2:15:58] so he started talk about I think he
[2:16:02] talked about three testimonies and you
[2:16:04] know I was so touched by these
[2:16:07] testimonies he was talking about his
[2:16:09] wife I will got married and what and of
[2:16:12] course he's like uh I don't know that
[2:16:15] call it a challenge or what but he talks
[2:16:18] about real life he brings a testimony he
[2:16:21] shows you how God has done it for him so
[2:16:23] that night I went to bed and I was like
[2:16:25] oh my God he's so you know he talks
[2:16:29] about this and the thing is so real
[2:16:31] before you so I couldn't sleep Honestly
[2:16:34] though he came here for the service very
[2:16:37] early so I was like God in this service
[2:16:41] I need you so uh the brother I don't
[2:16:44] know I've forgotten his name the brother
[2:16:46] from Kenya who preached on Morning Glory
[2:16:48] all those sermons to the brother the
[2:16:51] main speakers now brother Michael and
[2:16:53] then brother Isaac you could see that
[2:16:55] God is here you could their preaching
[2:16:58] were so intertwined that you could
[2:17:00] actually realize that God is there but
[2:17:03] now I wanted that personal experience
[2:17:05] with God
[2:17:06] now after brother brothers
[2:17:09] spoke at the home
[2:17:12] I was like I need to ask Brian I'm
[2:17:15] supposed how do you pray
[2:17:17] because you know I pray
[2:17:19] ing for the ministry praying for your
[2:17:22] life praying for the young people those
[2:17:24] that are back sleeping those from
[2:17:26] Lifeboat can tell you that we've been
[2:17:27] praying for we have this prayer together
[2:17:30] fasting so I was like he has so many
[2:17:33] strong testimonies how does he pray
[2:17:36] so I at some point I failed to ask him
[2:17:39] but now you know the when you sitting
[2:17:41] here you look at the ministers what they
[2:17:43] are doing their quotes and everything
[2:17:46] around oh my God
[2:17:48] so after the preaching
[2:17:51] uh
[2:17:52] brother suppose he came and stood here
[2:17:55] and he was calling people to pray
[2:17:57] and I don't know how what it was about
[2:17:59] but he called people to pray and I was
[2:18:02] like
[2:18:03] I need to ask him how he prays but I
[2:18:06] fear to go back because the past I asked
[2:18:09] many questions I was asking how did this
[2:18:12] happen and he was explaining so I was
[2:18:14] like I think I'll bother him but I
[2:18:16] wanted to ask him how do you pray so as
[2:18:20] we are praying everybody is praying
[2:18:22] uh I think people were in The Altar
[2:18:26] brother
[2:18:28] suppose comes and I was seated there and
[2:18:31] he tells me I have a leadership of the
[2:18:33] Holy Spirit to pray for you to pray with
[2:18:36] you and then as he was praying
[2:18:38] I was like Am I Dreaming because I
[2:18:41] wanted to ask him how do you pray and
[2:18:43] then he's telling me the Holy Spirit has
[2:18:45] come here has told me to come and pray
[2:18:47] with you
[2:18:48] now if you don't believe that God was
[2:18:50] here in this confession I don't know
[2:18:53] amen so I want to thank God that in his
[2:18:57] prophecy okay he was speaking when he
[2:19:00] was praying he was telling me that uh
[2:19:03] I think he told me that because I went
[2:19:05] back to him he told me that day what is
[2:19:06] he spoke he wasn't he it wasn't him
[2:19:10] so he was telling me God has answered
[2:19:12] you God is going to bless you and I
[2:19:15] actually believe that that was the holy
[2:19:17] spirit because I wanted to go to ask him
[2:19:19] that I want to ask him why we praise but
[2:19:22] he came and just told me God has told me
[2:19:25] to come and pray with you
[2:19:27] amen so I actually started crying I
[2:19:31] don't cry any Holy by the way
[2:19:34] honestly I don't cry
[2:19:36] but I started crying I was like I was
[2:19:39] like I'm crying so I started cleaning
[2:19:42] myself and I had to come here and sing
[2:19:44] you know so honestly I've been blessed
[2:19:47] and I I actually believe that God has
[2:19:49] answered my prayers in this convention
[2:19:52] God bless you
[2:19:54] amen
[2:19:55] so uh just before I sing a song to call
[2:19:58] to finalize their lost and found
[2:20:01] properties there's this bug I didn't
[2:20:03] open it for saturated reasons uh this if
[2:20:08] it is yours you get it with the brother
[2:20:09] lumo and then this Kenyan coin
[2:20:13] uh please if it shows come for it
[2:20:16] amen

[2:20:21] not theirs it means I don't know that

[2:20:24] that
