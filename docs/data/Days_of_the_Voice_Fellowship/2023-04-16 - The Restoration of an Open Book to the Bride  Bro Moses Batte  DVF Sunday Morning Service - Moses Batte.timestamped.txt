[1:34:04] his feet as pillars of Fire and
[1:34:07] he had in his hand a little book open
[1:34:12] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[1:34:14] and his left foot on the earth and cried
[1:34:18] with a loud voice as when a lion roars
[1:34:21] and when he had cried seven Thunders
[1:34:25] uttered their voices and when the seven
[1:34:27] Thunders uttered their voices I was

[1:34:32] Heaven saying unto me seal up those
[1:34:35] things with the seven Thunders uttered
[1:34:37] and write them not
[1:34:40] and the angel which I saw stand upon the
[1:34:43] sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[1:34:46] hand to heaven and served by him
[1:34:50] who live forever more forever and ever

[1:35:13] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:35:17] finished as he has declared to his
[1:35:19] servants the prophets
[1:35:20] and the voice which I had from Heaven
[1:35:23] spoke unto me again and said go and take
[1:35:27] the little book which is open in the
[1:35:30] hand of the Angel and which standeth
[1:35:32] upon the sea and upon the Earth and I
[1:35:36] went unto the angel and said unto him
[1:35:39] give me the little book and said unto me
[1:35:42] take it and eat it up and it shall make
[1:35:46] thy Berry bitter but it shall be in thy
[1:35:50] mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[1:35:53] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[1:35:56] I ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[1:36:00] as honey and as soon as I had eaten it
[1:36:03] my belly was bitter and said unto me

[2:27:08] want to tell you Church someone is not
[2:27:11] happy
[2:27:12] when you have power around you
[2:27:15] it's not happy when you're anointed

[2:27:24] the Bible says
[2:27:28] the Yoke shall be broken
[2:27:31] so the devil is not happy
[2:27:34] Hallelujah you to be anointed
[2:27:37] that is why we shall bring funny things
[2:27:41] around you because you lose the

[2:28:48] prophets
[2:28:49] he spoke the word and the squeals were
[2:28:53] created
[2:28:55] that is
[2:28:58] so the devil does not want that brother
[2:29:03] praise God
[2:29:05] he shall cause you to have funny funny
[2:29:07] things instead of praying instead of
[2:29:10] reading the Bible instead of reading the

[2:29:16] things of God
[2:29:18] will be taken out
[2:29:21] Hallelujah because he acts the anointing
