Amen Let us give the Lord a c of Praise this evening amen praise God turn that is the Lord good is the Lord good your amen is down is the Lord good amen we are so happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen and this evening as I informed you we are having brother Ephraim from ethopia isn't it wonderful amen among all the people that believe the message in the beginning in Ethiopia as a matter of fact I was looking back all the first brothers that believe the message and now all ministers and ephra was the youngest among all of them but when you see what God has used him to do in the southern parts of the country he is just [Music] mindblowing you know he's um started a few churches there baptized quite many people and maybe brother you may want to take a moment tell us a little bit about what God is doing there before you go into the preaching you to do that but I'm telling you God is Not bankrupt of [Music] witnesses God is going to have witnesses in every place in every area in the world someone who will stand for this message someone who will stand for the truth are you a witness Ephraim is a witness amen and as we receive him we ask that the Lord will speak to you and uh he's here with his wife I don't know why you Mrs ifra you start all the way [Music] back I'm sure your husband may want to see you say Amen when you join me to welcome Mrs Ephraim to God bless you thank you for coming to Fellowship as well with us God bless [Music] you God bless you everyone you may have your [Music] seats I am quite amazed what the Lord is doing in Uganda I appr appreciate for God is using him God is Not Looking for your knowledge God is Not Looking which church you came from God is Not Looking your your energy God is looking on your heart and your heart will determine on how the Lord going to use you and I appreciate everyone of you may the Lord bless you I am very amazed to see brother shame and his wife with him they had such an amazing wedding on Saturday I still want to say may God bless you I appreciate for the blessing of the Lord upon your lives and you see the Lord is doing many things in Uganda and the same way that God is doing in Uganda God is starting his work also in ethopia we appreciate what God is doing in Ethiopia we had quite few numbers baptism that is very profound the way how they come to the baptism in their life after baptism is a very profound testimony and God is doing Mighty work in the southern part of and I appreciate the Lord for that amen [Applause] uh quite the few testimonies I'll be talking on Sunday in the morning but just to say something the brothers from Ethiopia the ministers they have passed their greetings to you they said pass the greeting the love Hallelujah they think about you they stream from you and they pray for you also hallelujah hallelujah I appreciate all of you if we can let us just stand in our feet and open our Bibles from Isaiah chapter 59 Isaiah chter 59 verse 19 I'll will be speaking on raising a standard raising a solid standard Hallelujah Isaiah 59 verse I'll read it in the name of the Lord so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him [Music] Hallelujah you may have your seats it is Isaiah 59 Isaiah 59 verse 19 it says the spirit of the Lord Lord a standard against him and I would like to take our attention in in in the beginning you see God wants to have a fellowship God loves to have a fellowship because he wants to have his own Fellowship his own church created an Eden and he placed Adam and Eve in that Eden but you see the devil will come and turns God's Eden Satan's Ed he comes and deceive Eve he comes and deceive the perfect Fellowship [Music] he comes and deceive the Divine [Music] love and after deceiving Eve Adam was also deceived and the church was deceived hallelujah hallelujah and Satan came in that Eden and turns God's Church Satan's and right now we are living in the most deceitful age more than that was in the beginning more than the days of Noah more than the days of Moses more than the days of Jeremiah more than the days of oiah we are living in the most deceitful age and the devil come with all power he has to deceive the very elect one as it was in the beginning so we see God wants to have a fellowship and he created an Eden every evening he comes to Adam and to Eve and he preaches someon and the sermon he preached it was life for them they don't know about sickness they don't think about tomorrow they don't think about any disase there is never accident they don't know they don't know anything about failure they don't know anything about Sin but you see the devil will come and insert his deception and turns the God's Eden to Satan Hallelujah hallu let us read a quote it says how can I overcome paragraph 44 it says we this age that we are living in it is one of the greatest this church is the greatest of all Church ages because it is the ending of time and blending of Eternity and then it is the greater sinful age it is more seen in this age than there ever been and the power of Satan is more times higher to fight against than it was in any age Hallelujah it is saying the most sinful age is not just Ephesus it is not just sermania it is the age that we are living in the devil is coming with all power he has to deceive you to deceive your identity to deceive your potential to deceive your faith in God this is the age and he's coming with all power he has Hallelujah and there is a battle we are facing my and when the scripture when the talks about Sin it is not talking about adultery it's not talking about lies it is more than adultery it is more than about Li it's more than about it it is about deception it deceives you it will take your identity you will not know who you are hallelujah hallelujah but the scripture we read when the Devil comes like a flesh also God is coming to raise up your standard Hallelujah he shall lift you up he shall increase your standard hallelujah amen I want us to go to the message called Satan's aen 69 and again it is a religious [Music] sin as it is in the beginning so [Music] deceitful as it was in the beginning as it was in the Eden it was so deceitful watch it now it's not just purely old everyday sin committing adultery getting drunk and using God's name in vain that is not it no that's not it it's telling us here it is not just committing adultery it is not just speaking lies it is not using God's name in vain there is something more than that that is very sinful that is going to deceive the bride Hallelujah and in paragraph 7 it says you remember years ago many of you here the old times remember that the sermon I preach on the disappointment at the Judgment the harot she ain't going to be disappointed she knows where she is going the drunkers ain't going to be disappointed there the both leers the compers the Liars the theves he is going to be they are not going to be disappointed but the man who thinks is right there is a disappointment Hallelujah the man who thinks they know Jesus Christ it is here telling us the sin that we are talking about is a religious sin because every time what they do they will tell you we know Jesus Christ they will tell you when you come and join our church now you have the right connection with God they will come with a religious dress the same thing that the devil did in the beginning he he didn't tell her that he's a devil he didn't tell her that he's going to deceive her he came quoting a scripture he came uh what the what God have said before to her he came quoting the scriptures to her but the things that he does he will take away a small word and take away the life from it so that's what they doing today they will tell you they know Jesus Christ they preached Jesus Christ but when he was passing through them they never recognize him why they were deceived they never recognized him they were calling him you B you are the devil but they go every Sunday to to the church and they preach the gospel and they will say a messiah will come through a virgin bu when he passing through they never recognize the life they live it out Hallelujah that is the dangerous deception we could ever and they will tell you we have the life and they will point you to themselves they don't point you to the to Christ they point you to their denomination they will point you to their to their faces they will point you to their intellect they will point you to their denomination but we thank the Lord Jesus Christ that he has lift our our standards he has increased our standards that we can see through it all Hallelujah so there is a battles we are facing and the battles we are facing is more than drinking alcohol is more than committing adulter is more than that it is more than what we think about Hallelujah it is the most deceitful age we are living and he has come with all power he can to deceive so these people they come to church they pay their tithe they preach Jesus Christ but they never know Jesus chist they claim they know Jesus Christ and they kill Jesus Christ yes Hallelujah they will claim they know Jesus Christ but they will take away the life from it and they will give you their identity they will preach to you their denominational sermons Hallelujah there is a battles we are facing so me coming to church only is not enough me attending every W day for me is not enough pay my ti only is not enough A good sermon to preach is not enough making the message looking beautiful is not enough worshiping only is not enough the ble is more than that the ble is more than coming to church the B is being decent looking dress dressed very well the battle is more than that the battle is more than looking a good man ble is more than being humble there is a battle we are facing this battle is deception hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so today I must increase my standard today I must lift my standard it is more than going to church is more than playing church more than playing your Hallelujah the message is not a joke the message is life himself Hallelujah we should not play with the message the message is not a joke being comfortable with it is not enough quoting the scripture is not enough Hallelujah there should be an increase there should be standard Hallelujah there should be standard in your life there should be standard in your fath hallelujah amen let's go and read paragraph 64 there is a God of this world that I preached to you about last Sunday here he is today in dece that tremendous how that tremendous time that we are living in is the most glorious time of all ages because we are facing the greatest Millum again we are facing the aen again but right at this age all the dece every tactic that he ever used and being able to deceive wh he is gathered all together and reforce himself came down like a god not as a devil he's not just coming he's reinforcing himself to come and deceive not like the devil but as a god he's coming preaching the word he's coming telling you all what he can do he has reforced himself and come to deceive the bride if it was possible he could even deceive the elect that is how much serious he was he's reinforcing himself down but right at this age all the dece and every tactic that he ever used and been able to deceive wi he has gathered all together and reforce himself and came down like God and has put himself in a place of God religious and can the scripture and can tell you the scripture just as Satan did to Eve the Garden of Eden but leave all live out one spot out it it's all has he do make that Gap where the poison doctrine of the devil can pull through like the thinking man filter was talking about the other night so he will come and he will leave out one spot out of it that is what he does he comes with the scripture but when the scripture tells you that you're going to live going to twist it and tell you that you're going to die yes dressed up with a religious dress coming to come to attack the elect one if it was possible to come and attack the one and deceive Hallelujah let's read 66 in the days of Noah he explained that impossible for it to rain from Heaven There is no rain up there he his great scientific gospel that he preached in the garden of Edy he could shoot the instrument to the [Music] moons and prove there is no moisture up there but God said there would be a rain but Satan succeeded and poisoned the minds of the People by a scientific research it could not be done that it was done God said it will be done and it was done I'm here to assure you when God said you have done it because he has seen it you over already done it that is how true the word of God is and he has told you that you have done it he has paid you price and he has sacrificed all the payment he has paid all the price and that is real ass sure as it is hallelujah the devil cannot take away that from you the denomination cannot take that away from you any person cannot take it out you because it is Assurance at it g is so personal with you and the God nothing comes between you and the word it is so personal for you it is your own life it is your own self Hallelujah when you are reading the word calling up your name it is calling up your name it is calling you to the word hallelujah it is speaking about you hallelujah hallelujah but the Devil comes he tried to take away some words and made you feel like you are not worthless you don't belong here hallelujah hallelujah we are here to prove the devil that he he came to a wrong person today he came to a wrong place today today is not his day today is my day that I'm going to increase my standard I'm going to increase my standard I'm going to rise up Hallelujah [Music] we thank God and in 67 paragraph 67 it says now in the days of Jesus he did the same thing he poisoned their minds Again by dece misinterpreting the word if thou be the Son of God now let me see you do something Hallelujah so we see the devil is quoting a scripture so that is telling me I should rise my standard up I should increase my standard than more than cting a scripture more than speaking in Tong more than prophecies there should be something that I should be looking for is more than cting the scripture it is more than quoting the message Hallelujah the standard should make a difference and that when the standard did make the difference the anointing will come and took ever Hallelujah when the anointing comes that will make a difference a difference between Pentecostal Church Mage Church the difference between a man God called man and a man called man Hallelujah there should be a difference between God called man and just man called the anointing comes that will make the difference Hallelujah when we read the scripture of Ephesians chapter 1 we that Apostle Paul he confidently said it I the Apostle of Jesus Christ he know for sure that title was not given by a man he know for sure the title he received was not by a man it was not by a peer it was not from some denomination because when the Devil comes at you he doesn't care about the purpose he doesn't care about your titles Hallelujah but there is something that touch poor he said the Apostle of Jesus Christ he knows for sure he called by God he's not called by a man he not sent by a man he is sent by God and God will take care of him [Applause] Hallelujah that's why when we see Elijah he got in a very hard time where there is no food where there is no people but there is something that he sure of he is called by God and when he was in the desert he didn't call for some denominational church he didn't look for a paper who have sent him there Hallelujah all he does is he looked above and he called upon God and God came down himself and sent his fire and send what he wanted because the ministry and the vision is not of a mind it is of God hallelujah so when you take full charge of God take care of you he will be with you because for sure you know you are called by God you are predestinated by God hallelujah amen when the anointing comes it makes the difference hallelujah hallelujah whether I'm a preacher whether you are a student there should be a difference between quoting a message and living the life of the message there should be a difference between TI preachers and God-fearing preachers Hallelujah theyy to please when the ti p when when they see there is someone is paying a good TI that personage that person whatever you are doing you are doing good keep it up we are with you we will support you yet they know they are going to hell Hallelujah when the anointing comes it makes the difference between a TI preacher goding preacher Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah because there is nothing that will stop Apostle Paul from preaching whether there is death whether there is persecution whether there is a soldiers going to arrest him he knows for sure who has called him he knows for sure whom he's working for he knows for sure Hallelujah you know for sure who called you you know for sure who who predestinated you [Applause] Hallelujah we thank the Lord for this that God has called me and God has called you those he called he elected and those he elected he justified those he justified he has already glorified he didn't say he will glorify he said he already glorified hallelujah hallelujah you are in his mind before appear to appear here you appeared in God's mind for sure you know where you're going to Hallelujah Hallelujah God has called you and that calling should be so precious for us hallelujah amen God is increasing our stand hallelujah hallelujah I want to talk about why did God came down why what makes God came down Hallelujah why are we preaching about the second coming of Jesus Christ and and why did God came down to earth Hallelujah I want us to think about that because for sure it will open many of our thoughts because many people they will come to you and they will tell you something that is not in the scripture we should know why God has to come down God didn't come down to give you a promotion to give you a car God didn't come down to give you better life that is what the church looks like now they will tell you that you're going to get these things you're going to get that things you're going to get your promotions yes for sure we know we you're we're going to get that promotion yes you're going to be healed if you're coming for that purpose to this church to this church you will miss a great point but if you're coming for the car promotion or a job promotion yes you'll get your promotion yes you'll get what you yes you will be healed but you will miss the point again what is the main purpose of you coming here what is the main purpose of God coming down Hallelujah that's why I said before the anointing should make a difference between curse breaking preacher the word open preacher Hallelujah there is a big difference there Hallelujah yes you're going to get your healings yes you're going to get your promotions but there is something bigger than that there is something bigger than that there is something your soul is lacking Hallelujah there is something your soul is thirsty Hallelujah hallu God comes because he cares he cares for his word he has made a promise already Hallelujah because of his what God cares made him come made him come because in the beginning the church was deceived he had created an Eden and he placed Adam in Eden in that and the devil will come and deceive this church Hallelujah and made it Satan's so now God is coming again in Satan's Hallelujah to have his own church so we are in Satan's aen but we are of God's Church Hallelujah God has come to open a church to tell the devil now I have a church and this church will not fall this church will never fail because this church is myself I have died for it and my blood has paid the price for it Hallelujah are you in that church are you in that church are you in that church Hallelujah yes you are in that church hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah God has come down in Satan Eden and open the church now you are fellowshipping with hallelujah hallelujah we thank the Lord I want us to uh open the God who is rich in Mercy Hallelujah paragraph 98 it says and the message that Martin Luther brought of justification was all right for Luther's age that's as far as it went sanctification was F in wile's age that's as far as it went then we come into Pentecostal AG it is a restoration of the gifts is very fine a very fine thing it was fine in that age but we are going beyond that now we are beyond that just as us there is a world we are going to become Beyond these things because we have done that same thing with it that they did before make an idol out of it I belong to this order of it I belong to that order of it I'm here to tell you we are more than justification we are more than sanctification we are more than the Pentecostal gift we are more than that the church I'm here to tell you Church it is time to play church it's not time to play the church because God is here raising the standard of his church and God is calling for for you to come in and he's increasing your standard he is going beyond that he's going beyond our thoughts is going beyond our ideology he going Beyond moral knowledge he's going more than the denomination of people and this church is not sued by any denomination the name is just attached to one thing only and that is the name of Jesus Christ this church the head is Jesus Christ himself the preacher is Jesus Christ himself the word is Jesus Christ himself hallelujah hallelujah and this church is raising the standard is increasing the standard when the Devil comes like a FL God increase the stand Hallelujah today it's increasing our standard standard is more than justification is more than sanctification is more than being a Pentecost [Applause] Hallelujah let's continue a title called what was the Holy Ghost given for Christ brought himself into the church therefore now watch at that day you will know that I am I am in the F and you are in me and I am in you and that day you will know it for it is the whole thing at one Plan of Redemption that you will know come down that God coming down to live in dwelt with and commun to his people in the beginning as it was in the beginning as it was in Eden he wanted to commune with people to commune with his own so God put himself in that church paragraph 15 what is the Holy Ghost God in you what is it for to continue his work among his people to bring his church together what the devil has deceived in the beginning what the devil has put in the beginning he is now trying to do it again he's trying to solve the problem he's trying to commune with the people trying to bring his church together to bring the church to one place to a place in this day far beyond the lutherans Methodist it is a place to adoption the Rapture Grace that with this part of the church when the spirit moves in the church it will just raise and will bring forth bring forth all the redeemed that is touched in that Spirit Hallelujah when he brought himself forth when he pours him Spirit forth whoever received that Spirit Hallelujah will be to him will come to him because those are the redeemable and he will bring forth all the redeemable that's touched by the spirit Hallelujah those lutherans who stood there with all the light they had in deification those Methodist they fell on that floor they thow the water in their [Music] face from the spirit sprinkle them through sanctification those Pentecostals they walked up and down in the street and called them Tong of L they called themselves Tong of L and in gospel language all that they say they will stand in the righteousness in the sight of God the day just as certain as in the Bible stands here if you believe me to be a servant you call me his Prophet I don't call myself that but you listen I'm telling you in the name of the Lord those that are in Christ will God bring forth with him at his coming the resurrection and one of that are in Christ you are in Christ you are in Christ you have his spirit so he is responsible to come for you and redeem you because in the Eden it came for fruit it came for sin and for that sin he's coming to redeem his own and take back to his church Hallelujah are you one of them are you one of them are you one of them hallelujah hallelujah that's why we we see pressure in this last age a pressure that was not there before in the battles we are facing is not like in the days of Noah it's more than that and there is a pressure in the bride that is that is attacking in the spirit of deception and you see this pressure when you see before a plane takes off you can see in the engine there is a lot of personalization going on there's a lot of pressure going on there is a lot of pressure going on Hallelujah for the plane to take off and until the plane takes off pressure will have to pressurize pressurize pressu until plane is above the clouds and now everything will become everything will be settled

how many have been blessed this amen we give the glory to the Lord we're just going to sing a few songs before we close but I tell you what but Ephraim is just a vessel in the hands of the Lord we should just keep praying for him uh what you had today is from a man that has really studied the message he loves the message with all his and you know he has been also a standard that God Has Lifted in this against the enemy amen the bride is that standard the message is that time and that message is in us and I remember you know God knows our life know we not here by accident none of us is here by accident tell your neighbor you're not here by accident God is Raising you for a purpose and that purpose is to put the devil where he belongs Hallelujah to put the devil where he belongs amen we are here to live a life that will be the standard when when when when God puts the holy spirit in US is a standard that God has amen raised the enemy cannot defeat amen no matter what he does around us God also has a standard you know God looks at the Devil and then he looks at his bride and then he say what about that if you've if you've wasted everybody what about thatu what do you say about that I am so glad I am one of them I'm so glad I'm one of them and when Ephraim was about 16 17 years old you know I was I I I always remember that whenever I see him preaching you know I was together with my wife and we saw him coming out of the house of his mother and that would be the first time for us to set our eyes on him and the Holy Spirit spoke through my lips told my wife that he's going to believe the message and he will be a preacher and at that time he was just playing how do you call that game brother ephra basketball yeah he's a very good B he used to be a very good basketb it was not into the religious things and preaching but I tell you what that was not me it was God seeing through the future and seeing that he's going to be one of the standard that God will raise you know the message is the standard the word is the standard the holy spirit is the stand but you see it has to work through a vessel and we are that vessel and today seeing our brother preached such a a powerful uh sermon I've just been impacted I've just been blessed maybe I will just he said he'll share some testimonies on Sunday but I'll share this on one of the services here we we on Wednesday I
