chapter 6 we begin with Isaiah chap from verses 1 to to 8 it says that in the year that King hoseah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne High lifted up and his train filled the temple and two says above it stood Sims each one had six wings with the twin he covered his face and with twin he covered his feet and with twin he did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of host the whole earth is full of his glory in the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I who is me for I am undone because I am a man of un lips and I dwell in the midst of the people of ankin lips for my eyes have seen the king the Lord of host and six say the then flee one of the Sims unto me having a life call in his hand which he had taken with the tongues from off the Altar and he and he laid it upon my mouth and said L this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here I am send me amen Lord Jesus we thank you for the portion of the scripture we have read this evening I just ask you Lord in these few moments we going to spend here that Lord you will come and take take this word Lord expound it to us Lord Jesus open our understanding and increase Lord our uh renew our Wings of Faith this evening that God you are helping us to fly higher Lord Jesus in the supernational this evening receive the glory Lord Jesus in the most precious name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen you may have your seats this uh evening amen we shall read also in Exodus chapter 33 uh we begin from verses 13 14 and 15 Exodus chapter 33 vers 15 and he said unto him if th pray go not with me carry us not up than for wherein shall it be known here that I and thine people have found Grace in thy sight it is not it's not in that that thou goest with us so shall we be separated I and thine people from all the people that are upon the face of the Earth and the Lord said unto Moses I'll will do this thing also that thou H has spoken for thou Hast found Grace in my sight and I Know Thee by name blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus uh this evening I want us to I'll talk about I'll call it the the Vitality of God is presence amen I remember we've ever talked about uh being in his presence the prophet preached the message in his presence amen preachers have preached thousands and millions of Simmons about the presence of God blessed be the name of the Lord and in Christianity what keeps us moving on it is the presence of God without the presence of God this Christian walk becomes burdensome every time you find when you have to struggle with the Believers to come for fellowship or you are struggling with them to pray you just know there is something wrong somewhere amen but when the presence of God is there it act as Tabo blessed be the name of the Lord and for people who know how to drive or people who drive or who ride motorcycle even those who ride this sports bike when you are approaching the hill you'll have if if it is a motor kind of means you'll have to engage a heavy gear blessed be the name of the Lord and to me I may say that that heavy gear is that presence of God Amen even when you are riding the one they call M this local bike the hero Road master I even wonder whether Dan blessed be the name of the Lord those were the cars of of them days amen so even when you're riding a bicycle and you approaching the hill you'll have to add more strength and where we have read in Isaiah here we are seeing Moses speaking to God and telling God if you're not going with us so we are going nowhere because Moses knew or had a secret he knew what it means by the presence of God Amen so there is such a great importance of being in the presence of God what what is keeping us awake what keeps you moving up to today is that presence of God you can call it you can call it the pillar of fire because the Bible says that the pillar of fire led the children of Israel God LED them through the pillar of fire and God was hiding in the pillar of fire amen because God knew that these people would not go or reach anywhere without his presence blessed be the name of the Lord and that's why God put too much emphasis when comes to that because he knows that we as human being without God we already defeated beings but when God is in our midst amen and that's why Through the Bible you realize if you read the Book of Judges that each time these people entangled with the things of the world each time they stray they do things contrary to what God wanted them to do the presence of God departed away from them and every time the presence of God moves away you find chaos in their midst blessed be the name of the Lord you find them in battles you find them losing the battle and if there is one thing which the children of Israel were cautious of it was the presence of God in their midst but that's why they had strong laws whereby if you mess around amen if you play around brother I think I I think the voice was okay uh if you play around with that you were Stone to death that without God we cannot amount to anything blessed be the name of the Lord and here we are seeing uh prophet Isaiah in Isaiah chapter 6 is giving is saying something say that in the year that King oah King Uzziah hoseah died I also I saw sorry I saw also the Lord praise be to God remember Isaiah was a major prophet but the man is saying the day the king died he all so so the Lord sometime it brings a question to me because you say that I also meaning that others were seeing the Lord and Isaiah was not seeing him yes like he could hear testimony maybe about the Abraham about other prophets but here he says now he had personal testimony amen and that's why every Christian must have a personal experience with God we must know the God we are talking about we must know the God we are serving we must know the ground where we are standing this is not all about my father's God my mother's God my papa's God but identifying himself he said I am the god of Abraham I'm the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob he was identifying himself with individuals blessed be the name of the Lord and here Isaiah says that I also saw the Lord seated sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple blessed be the name of the Lord so what happened to Isaiah here we are seeing this very chapter oah had to first die for the man of God to see God blessed be the name of the Lord you know one thing with this if you if you happen to have a visitation from God no matter what you're going through no matter the challenges you are facing what your neighbors are like they talking about you what you uh your friends are saying about you you will stand because you know where you are standing in this Christian work we are not men Pleasers but we are God Pleasers we are the children of God Amen and our duty on Earth is to serve God so when you encounter God you will know your position and your responsibility in the house of God Amen so but you come as a City of Refuge running for your soul blessed be the name of the Lord because we are living Liv in the time where the Bible says that we should not forsake assembling together of saints as we are seeing that day approaching when that day is approaching we all to be one amen because something is fixing to happen and the only way we can make it is when we are together Unity is strength blessed be the name of the Lord when we are one with are strong you bring your fire brother son so bring his fire and we make one big fire the devil cannot come near it blessed be the name of the Lord amen the prophet tells us about Isaiah I was blinded by the king all his Hope was on the King when he had needs maybe say how the king just after all the King was his friend he was there with a rich man who had everything Authority and all those things blessed be the name of the Lord but one day when the king died this man realized that he was alone many time we are blinded by the things and the people around us you know after all ah brotherus will H you don't want to struggle because ah enus is there he will help you don't want to do this uhuh I know he will stand in the Gap brother the time has come when we have to know that either you stand in the gap or no one is standing in the Gap blessed be the name of of the Lord let us carry the Lord's burden amen praise be to God when the king died Isaiah realized all along has been lying himself and that is what happened when we are living double standard life you sit in church for two days for one year 10 years 30 years in church attending all the three services in the week but my brother my sister there is that time when you have to meet God Alone that is what matters in Christianity amen that is what ought to make our hearts tremble to know that there is a time when we are meeting God alone when you are going to give account as you blessed be the name of the Lord I don't want to be disappointed at that last moment and I realize that I have run in vain I have battled in vain amen that's why the Bible says we should make our calling and election sure amen it did not say that so and so will make your calling an election sure this is all about an individual work you know where you are standing you know what you are doing you know whether you are Christian or not you know whether you are progressing spiritually or not amen that's why you have to make your calling and election sure blessed be the name of the Lord time came for Isaiah to meet the reality now amen and he was desperate you see desperation butam in the message desperation that God uses desperation to bring that which is in US amen So This Man became desperate because he knew now either God you help me or I die the same thing happened to Jacob you know as long as every time you move you feel it there blessed be the name of the Lord but there is that time when you have to meet the reality but thanks be to God that God always shows us how to escape the Bible it was for our examples that God's presence has been from the world in fact from day one amen God always want to walk with us he always want to lead us even when Jesus came and said that come unto me all those who are yoke with the heaven I day because when you are yoked with with a burden or with a ladden of anything you cannot walk it is a journey amen the day you were born on Earth you started walking and when you accepted Jesus Christ then you started now going the upward way and there are many things alongside this journey the devil has many obstacles on your way to make you not reach there why because he was there he know what is there amen you see nowadays like when you move around and people the place looks like heaven when the person has never even been in heaven but even in his conscience him being a sinner his conscience tells him that there is a better City a nice beautiful place somewhere amen now what the devil does he comes with a photocopy and try to make them comfortable for nothing blessed be the name of the Lord that's why the Bible tells us that our fathers they moved in ship skins they moved from town to town they moved in desert amen looking for City who he Builder and maker was God himself they never Ted brother they lived in tents they put like they wear sheep skins amen they were not comfortable because inside their heart there was something telling them there is somewhere where you came from blessed be the name of the Lord amen and then we are seeing the vision of Isaiah you saw the angels and what happened he realized that all along he has been wasting his time you know say yeah I've seen you angel I'm also perfect yes yes come on no he saw the glory of God he saw how belittle he was amen how merciful god has been to him because the Bible says that who is me even for him to see that presence he realized it was just the grace say what is me for man of unclean lips and he thought that dining with the King was such a great thing but here he says I even dwell among people with ugly lips that is what the presence of God brings amen it is the presence of God that makes you know what you are supposed to wear in the presence of God the only righteousness that can withstand the Presa of God is the righteousness of God that is the blood of Jesus Oh the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that is the token that we need praise be to God Amen and he said the post of the the post of the door moved and the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I oh who is me for I am undone the presence of God will always bring us into repentance that's why the prophet tells us that Godly Soul brings us into repentance that is the grace of God we are seeing about the Amazing Grace that when that Amazing Grace is revealed to us with a Grace that teaches us to fear it is the grace of God that brought fear in his heart and the house was fill with SM then say I what is me because I am a man of UN first of all we have to know how insufficient we are we just man human being and I dwell in the midst of people of uning lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of host then flew one of the Sims and to me you had to First repent Christian repent Amen to the to the to the prophet amen because God in fact God showed him all those things not to condemn him not to show how bad he is you are not even worthy you better go and die no but God wanted to show him something that uh there is something much better there is a place where I want you to be there's something that I want you to do for me but you cannot do it when you're in that state blessed be the name of the Lord and the angel coming he see that the angel and then flee one of the Sims unto me having the life called in his hand which are taken with the tongues from the of the altar amen it was taken off the altar blessed be the name of the Lord and what is this clothing tongue today brother sister this is the Holy Ghost God uses the Holy G he uses the H to cleanse the believer amen the Holy Ghost is the fire when he comes in our life he will cleanse all our Fields the fire we are talking about you see there's something uh there's something special with the fire of the Holy Spirit well the Bible says that when that fire came down even the stones melted and that is the fire of the Holy Ghost when he comes down he will melt each and everything in your life and that is what we need tonight amen the presence of God that will move Mountain the presence of God that will cleanse our hearts the presence of God that will set our hearts on fire the presence of God God that will bring Restoration in our soul the presence of God that will open our understanding the presence of God that will move our faith amen may God give us that there is abundance of being in the presence of God there was one man in the Bible his name is David one day he was Ring the Sheep of his father and the lion came David anywhere but David had an experience with God Amen David was already I was anointed yes sir and the bible say that anointing breaks the Yoke and anointing comes from the Holy Ghost amen he had encountered God where that presence came down it changed everything a young man slaying a bear a young man killing a lion brother that was not just an ordinary man but that was the presence of the Holy Ghost in that man amen talk of PSS that's why each time the presence of God moved from the of Israel they mour you find them pleading with God read the judges and God has always been faithful he always keeps his word and that's why he says those who are called by my name when they shall humble them themselves and pray amen I will hear their prayer from Heaven I will come down and amen and heal their land every time they drifted from the presence of God there are those few ruminant who remember say you know what we have sinen talk of Daniel in the Bible the Bible says in Daniel chapter 3 where he was praying he said God to us belong confusion of fces we have moved from the the words we have not taken heed to the words of your prophet amen and we are seeing this man repenting why was he repenting because the presence of God had moved from Israelite and the Bible tells us in Daniel's prayer that the very day started praying when Gabriel came down he told him the V started praying God send me amen but before Danel started to pray the Angels were at ease before the church starts to pray the angel they at before the Christians start to pray everything is at ease in fact even demons are at EAS but the moment the Christian start to pray hallelujah amen when the church starts to pray meetings starts in heaven conferen and conferences amen angels are called from different department because there are some few people in on Earth amen who are seeking for God's Direction blessed be the name of the Lord so you better start praying now amen you better keep on your knees blessed be the name name of the Lord when Anna was Barren she knew the only thing that could help her was the presence of God she never went start speaking around is after me no two three months without a baby you start you are scared one year I think my auntie I remember that very day even the words she spoke I still remember them I remember the uh my grandmother's uh children will not and who told you brother go in the presence of God start to pray and something is going to take place blessed be the name of the Lord these people they knew where the secret was it was because they were reading the word when a Christian is reading the word the word will always direct him to the right place even when trouble even when problem comes you will not have second alternative but as long as Plan B is there nothing will happen so she knew the only way I can con do you know that you can even convince God In Prayer yes sir bre let me tell you the God we are serving is God do you know that God has even listened to the prayers of demon have ever thought of that yes he has ever answered the prayers of demons they ask him oh Master why have you come this to us before our time please please do not chase us to at least allow us go in those Hogs then he answered that prayers then they went in Hogs and the Hogs all went into the sea if God could hear the prayer of demons how about a Believer who is under the blood of Jesus Amen if you could answer those the prayer of those who are under the blood of gods and Bs how much more those who are Redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ so she went in the presence of God because that is where the answer was and then she started it was just like God you up she comes today Builders know this most time like I do work with Builders they go back tomorrow like seven coures that's how it happens even in spiritual real you come and you build the first one when God as long as God allows you to put the First Foundation brother you know the house is finished make sure that that ground the foundation is put on the right uh uh like you are building on the right foundation when he accepts you and you start just though it is a finished work she started praying interceding because she knew when the presence of God comes here the story will change and because she was building that one day I don't whether it was morning or evening she was there busy that day it was massive she prayed she cried until she ran out of words so the priest came and fall the Bible say her lips was just she could even she was groaning in spirit but the presence of God was there and that was her day I'm I'm not even sure whether the priest knew what he was talking about because this priest was already called priest L priest but to remember character is made in prayer and also through the things we are going through because if this sister if she not have that character make we say now see what kind of priest are you do I look to be drunk are you laughing at me no that was not so with Anna but God used the PRI and said next year in such and such a time you're going to have a baby and it was and Samuel was born because the mother was in the presence of God so there is such a great thing to be in the presence of God Amen praise be to God may God keep us in his presence and here where we read we are seeing Moses is saying something because with Isaiah after now look look here after had worked on Isaiah he not say that you go for us uhuh you must be willing to serve you must be willing to go even when after the angel worked on Isaiah with that fire that clothing tongue from the altar God did not tell I said now you have been working now okay you can go he still ask who will go for us blessed be the the name of the Lord but because there was a man who was tuned God was so sure that Isaiah was going to answer that call amen Lord speak my Lord and I will quick to answer the when the call of fire touched the lips of the Prophet amen before Isaiah was sent something had to be done in his life first before a Believer is sent you must first meet God face to face like Moses that is the true witness you have met God you have spoken to God Amen what we are talking about this is not feelings this is not just presuming you must be sure in our Christian work brother you must be sure of where you are standing standing you must have something tangible that you have apprehended and you know you are clinging that's what we call the anchor the Anor is not just a word no sir when the aner is cast and is holding in Christ there you know where you are going God will never ever trust us until our anchor is holding into him blessed be the name of the Lord that's the only thing the only thingin line that makes difference in Christianity is people who know they are God we are in pentecostes we used to hear about God we used to worship like the way we worship you clap your hands you sing you cry you shout was not it because some even after shouting they go and fornicate after struggling and breaking shairs in the church then you find them stealing neighbors goat after jumping and jumping and jumping and even until even the clothes are what you find them cutting neighbors banana so still that is not but there are people amen the one whom we sing whose heart are all a flame not that their heart are within the flame no it is that heart which is all a flame in other words that heart is a flame itself brother Adam talks about a stream one time he was somewhere and so uh a stream all of us we know as stre and like it the water like bubbling and and then he was he was asking it but what makes you bubble like that what makes you and he says if that spring could speak it would have told him that even me I don't know but there is something within me that makes me Bubble amen that is the life of a Christian who is in Christ Jesus the force comes within you even when you don't want to do something you just realize you cannot like forego it even when you feel like I don't want to go to church I'm tired by the time you realize the person who who had sat on the bed who was planning to sleep you approaching agenda say to one it's because there is something there is that presence in your life brother this presence does not come by ising eating portion and beans eating chicken eating liver it comes through prayer reading the word pray first amen when did you last dream like have a spiritual Joel tells us in the last days he will SP upon all all those as long as your flesh he will pour His Spirit upon you the young men they will see Visions the old men they will dream dreams even upon the don't that God I want to dream I want to dream no that's not it eat the word listen to the message sometime you listen to the message until you get it drunk and you find yourself seated yes sir it has happened to me several times it's not that I'm there like literally but it's because I have listened to it until it's like I'm I've become see the right thing read the word pray prepare yourself the reason as why we don't see these things is because we are not prepared amen sometime we think that preparation is supposed all to be done at church only was your clothes Brothers he told them wash your clothes wash your souls do not come close to your women because the holy God was coming but sometime you come the church without repentance you know have strayed there you've not put yourself right you just come it's because you are lacking that presence amen blessed be that Moses said in Exodus 3 3:13 I found Grace in thy sight show me now thy way that is a prayer for every believer you must reach that point where you are when you find you not sure whether you are saved whether you are serving God whether you are Christian even our prophet of this age he told God I want to see you Moses wanted confirmation you remember when brother bham uh when he he he when he spoke that lie where when they called him and then he ran out and told the word wife that received that and tell them that I'm not in the house and when he went to pray for that girl who was sick and God told God rebuked him and when the prophet went to put himself right with God he prayed and he told God please show me a sign that you are forgiven it is very very important in our life we have to reach that point where you are so sure the reason asked why we still lie you just Le it's okay we R we cheat we are lazy in prayer we don't even want to sing it's because we are not sure the other day I was reading the message the first message in the table which he says faith is the substance I had read it and read but this time round it's like I saw it in another version brother Bram when he started explaining those senses one by one he says that when the sense of smell it smells something even if when it's not there you will not you cannot convince that it's not there when you smell a ships you cannot convince yourself there's no they flying ships within him because your s and St it is there and indeed it is there somewhere when your eyes have seen something amen you cannot convince that you have not seen that you have seen nothing and that's what we Christian we need the message having the books the courot and the what no but we must be sure you see if you read that uh that message I I think the message the word became flesh the one which the prophet preached in India when he went there those Hindus told them they knew he had to prove to them that what is written here what I have you have the Bible I have yes but for me I have the life or what is written here I can display it and that's what made difference amen so we Believers brethren we must be sure about God at least he has spoken to you at least yes okay for example if uh let's say a wife is entirely leaning on the husband my husband is a preacher or is a minister or is a with that when the husband sings and she enters the spirit then she cry Hallelujah but here something happens and the husband is taken if that sister is not sure where she is standing has been for years you have taken so you have your have your faith go but if she knows where she's standing and she knows that all things work together for good she will still stand amen because she had that but bam tells us here let me read some quotes here uh that uh in the message in his presence he say that I think man recognizes themselves to be Sinners and we may feel prity pretty good when we are out different places and feel like that we are we are pretty good but we never come in the presence of God then we see how we it is the power until you are paralyzed in his presence you will always remember you in such a holy fear and you them away from there away from his presence he begin to St with them amen you see what the devil did the devil to them they were not with Jesus and the storm Rose they went off without him and that is the devil's opportunity to start on a man that's why Church the dev we need that presence always to be here and we have to be so cautious about that presence and we have to be so jealous not to drive that presence away we are to be so careful not working it out by ourself but us fulfilling our responsibility amen because the Bible tells us we should not grow geve the spirit of Christ for we are SE until the day of our Redemption te went off without him there there was toast about and they didn't know what way to go the OES were break the Sheep was water loed and they had nowhere to get away from the power of Saturn that was crashing in on them amen and when you come to the you are never the same anymore a man that is that is what we need let that come in our life that is going to change us amen where men will be real men women real women ministers real minister amen we need that presence in the old test they were ston to death you go lie with a beast you are gone case why you want to drive the Pres of God go commit adultery Stone to death and the prophet tells that physical death is even much better than spiritual death because when you you die spiritually you are disconnected forever from God blessed be the name of the Lord and somewh say that your action our action God kick us out and have that mentality for us those for new those but if he for near you you will be mindful about your behaviors PR this is does not mean wallowing in sin compromising with the word here and there the same God my husband loves me you are running with other men my husband loves me you are doing this and that you are deceived you need a psychiatrist when you see God is touching somebody's Happening Here brother is crying be careful the presence of God it brings holy fear and that Holy fear will break a stub heart it will m a a stone heart when that presence moves amen it will break that stone your heart say God break me God melt me search me Lord help me amen when the word is preached the Holy Ghost move looking for who is ready you come to church put your phone on vibration every message that comes in you want to check you are not in the presence of God you are in the presence of Technology there are things which the Bible tells you that even nature itself teaches you so there are also things that we can say that a Believer a serious believer you know you don't need to be told that put off your phones I don't know whether they are here I'm just preaching because that's what God puts in my heart amen the presence of God will always tell you that and we are looking we are longing to be there but B I'm sometime in the meeting there where I read where he says that like as where that quietness where the presence of God was moving and he say that there was such a quietness that even if someone just drops a be behind hear Brethren let us ask for more of God when God will start not struggle church will be uncomfortable for some people amen people will find their places whether your plac is in the church or it is in the nightclub or in the church or in the Catholic ches so what we need is the presence of God it is such an important thing when that presence came to where Lazarus was in four days journey amen our presence called the man who was dead for 4 days and the man came back to life there was a man who died and his body was thrown where Elijah was bured was elishah and that presence broke the Bor of the of the Prophet oh God when you die when you anointed even your skeleton will be anointed blessed be the name of the Lord no in the day of Resurrection amen because already you have that that when they might M they will come there amen those elements that forms your body will start working on themselves blessed be the name of the Lord that's why we need the presence of God Moses knew that without the presence of God they cannot fight any battle they will be pray to their enemies so he told God unless you are going with us and when God said that that was not enough God told Moses okay now for you to be very to be so sure I'm going to walk you will see me you will see my back blessed be the name of the Lord that same God when when was coming to us he changed his dress wear and put on the body Jesus the very God said that heaven God it pleased him to dwell in your heart that is where he want to D well and that's why we are here we want God in our heart walking when we are sure that God is in the Throne of my heart that's when All Things become possible shall we stand on our feet amen he says in this message in this presence he says that then when comes in his presence when a man once comes the presence of God he's changed forever if there is any changing to him now there are at those who could walk in the presence of God and pay no attention to it it wasn't ordained to life but if he was predestinated of God as soon as that F that catches fire when you are predestinated to this blessed be the name of the Lord as soon as it is that thing that catches the fire blessed be the name of the Lord amen how many need this presence he is here amen because the Bible says it's God who follows his word to fulfill it when he say his word he must fulfill it Brethren there is something about the presence of God and the presence of God is nothing other than the New Birth the Holy Spirit look at the statch of the perfect man from Faith to love which is the cupstone how are you going to obtain those things without the presence of God but when you receive the Holy Ghost amen and you are baptized in that body you start to grow in that sture blessed be the name of the Lord and is that presence driving us that direction may God help us if you can make it a point this year and say God each one of us you must make a resolution God enough is enough I must be sure I remember one day I came here I had my body in my heart I said God today I need something at least that I I need something unusual or supernational I came here we prayed uh that day Pastor requested me to speak and after I was just kneeling here and I was praying I came and I had a very heavy hand on my head like this my head became so heavy I was trying to lift it up and I could not and I could feel like a human hand and I can't explain that but at least I say God I still need more of this so God is real God is true God keeps his word God speaks one day one brother was telling us how one day one brother
