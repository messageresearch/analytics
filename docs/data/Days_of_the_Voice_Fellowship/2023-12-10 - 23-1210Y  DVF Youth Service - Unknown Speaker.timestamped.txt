[6:14] we have a lot to deal with and we want

[7:22] uniformly together without stopping 1 2
[7:25] 3 go marriage is Honorable in all
[7:30] and the bed and the F but wers and
[7:35] adulterers God will judge amen you may
[7:38] be
[7:39] seated so I want to greet you all in the
[7:42] precious name of Jesus uh this is our
[7:45] youth meeting number two we've had the
[7:48] first one last year we were gathered
[7:50] about I think
[7:52] 30 uh we don't remember the number
[7:55] nobody recorded but maybe 36 37
[7:58] something like that and I'm told there
[8:00] are more than 40 others have just joined
[8:02] in so this meeting is very important
[8:07] because uh in schools they usually have
[8:11] uh what they call Senior teachers what
[8:16] else huh senior teachers and what
[8:20] else
[8:23] please I don't know why I'm not getting
[8:25] that
[8:27] counselors yeah senior teachers and
[8:29] counselors to be able to speak to the
[8:30] young people and then uh I don't know I
[8:33] don't um I think I attended one of those
[8:36] kind of meetings but usually in our
[8:38] school they used to separate girls and
[8:40] boys and then I don't know what they
[8:41] were telling girls that that the boys
[8:43] did not need to hear but in our meeting
[8:46] here at the church we we bring all of
[8:48] them together because we believe that
[8:50] the word of God can give us instruction
[8:52] that will help both of us
[8:56] together and uh really
[8:59] myself I do not although some especially
[9:02] when they hear me teaching they have
[9:04] considered me to I had one brother he
[9:07] called me he said ah brother I think you
[9:09] were a teacher I said uh you don't know
[9:12] what you're talking about I don't
[9:14] consider myself a teacher really uh so
[9:18] um there is a brother that really has a
[9:20] good teaching gift and he has Minister
[9:24] his ministry has really been a blessing
[9:26] to me in in that regard uh he's um
[9:31] from uh Ireland
[9:34] Ireland how many of you remember him
[9:38] brother uh what is his
[9:42] name
[9:45] yes I wanted to see that whether you
[9:48] remember or not his name is brother
[9:49] Andrew maray how many remember that in
[9:52] covid yes you remember how many remember
[9:56] him preaching to us
[9:57] teaching if you if you missed out you
[10:00] can go back on the I don't remember
[10:02] whether it is on this channel or on the
[10:04] first channel we are using but he is a
[10:06] very is a a very good teacher of the
[10:09] message and I think that uh him speaking
[10:13] to us can be a good blessing or you
[10:15] hearing him teach so I'm intending one
[10:18] of these days to invite him and I
[10:20] believe uh his ministry can be a
[10:21] blessing to us but
[10:23] meanwhile uh I'm your pastor and God has
[10:25] given me Grace to be able to uh be here
[10:29] and I I when I see something going wrong
[10:32] I need it to be corrected I want to
[10:34] guide you I want to make sure that
[10:35] things are done correctly and uh we know
[10:39] that we are a younger congregation
[10:40] starting out and there's a lot of
[10:43] marriages that are are going to come out
[10:45] but you see it has to come out to right
[10:49] most of your attention is now going to
[10:50] the other brothers why don't you keep
[10:52] your attention
[10:54] here brother Joel specifically
[10:57] yourself God God bless
[11:04] you
[11:06] because I I I want I have this bunch of
[11:10] questions part of it is talking about
[11:12] relationships and and marriage part of
[11:14] it is just doctrinal
[11:16] so because of time I will not go in
[11:20] details of bringing out every scripture
[11:22] on each some I'll just give an answer
[11:24] and if you feel not satisfied you can
[11:26] meet me and then I I I put more context
[11:28] to
[11:30] it but um I felt I needed to deal with
[11:33] this subject of
[11:35] marriage and a subject of
[11:38] fornication and I want to deal with it
[11:41] according to the message and that by the
[11:44] time we walk out of here each of us will
[11:46] know what we are expected of how we
[11:50] expected to do it even to some of you
[11:52] who are still younger and not ready for
[11:54] marriage you need to
[11:57] know so that you need to know how do we
[12:00] do
[12:01] it do we do it like everybody else or do
[12:05] we have a different way that we do
[12:07] it you understand what I'm saying so I I
[12:12] uh if you're going to keep quiet I would
[12:13] say nothing you need to answer me do you
[12:17] understand what I'm saying
[12:19] amen
[12:21] so we started out with Hebrews 13:4 it
[12:24] says marriage is Honorable in all now if
[12:28] you are married
[12:29] married you are going to be
[12:32] honored anybody who is married will be
[12:35] honored even marriage in itself is
[12:38] Honorable now I'm not going to talk
[12:41] about the subject of marriage in its
[12:45] deeper talk about relationships and all
[12:48] that how we are supposed to handle H as
[12:52] Believers but marriage in itself is
[12:55] Honorable um if in in some
[13:00] circles this thing needs to be
[13:04] reduced I don't know can someone help me
[13:07] come and uh reduce
[13:11] this ah I figured it out so um in some
[13:16] circles when people talk about
[13:19] marriage others I'll give you I'll begin
[13:23] with this example there's a younger man
[13:25] one time I think I was married but uh
[13:28] married maybe for about three years so I
[13:31] met this young man and I told him
[13:35] brother you are working he said yes I
[13:38] said brother you are of age you are now
[13:42] almost going to 30 years he said
[13:44] yes it is true why do you even mind I
[13:47] said brother I think you should think
[13:49] about marriage now he said look at this
[13:52] one we are thinking about we are praying
[13:54] about getting the Holy Spirit you are
[13:56] telling us about marriage what is wrong
[13:58] with you
[13:59] we should be talking about deeper things
[14:00] of God and you are bringing marriage why
[14:02] are you bring why are you people kindly
[14:04] minded what is wrong with you even you a
[14:06] minister I would have expected you to
[14:07] know better but you are telling me kind
[14:09] of
[14:11] things that
[14:13] brother was CAU
[14:16] red-handed in
[14:19] fornication you are now
[14:24] quiet so the question is was he
[14:26] spiritual or was he caral
[14:30] so sometimes when you don't think about
[14:32] marriage you are
[14:35] carel you find people growing especially
[14:40] boys growing 25 years 26 27 28 29 30 31
[14:49] 32
[14:51] 33 you know Jesus died at
[14:55] 33 so by the time you reach 33 you you
[14:58] getting expired
[15:01] almost but that's not the point the
[15:03] point is
[15:04] this by the time you are of
[15:07] age 18 years even the law of Uganda
[15:10] tells you by the time you become 18
[15:12] years and above you are fit to get
[15:15] married did you know the laws of Uganda
[15:17] allow you to get married at 18
[15:19] years did you know
[15:22] that how many is tired here today how
[15:26] many have eaten something and uh you are
[15:28] not so bad
[15:31] love so
[15:33] please respond to me I'm not preaching
[15:37] we are talking we having a conversation
[15:40] together so what was I
[15:45] saying someone reaches 18 years
[15:48] according to the government of Uganda
[15:50] you are fit to get married or to marri
[15:54] how many are 18 years and older here
[15:57] raise up your hand
[15:59] please if you are kindly I'm asking you
[16:01] to raise up your hand okay according to
[16:04] Uganda you can
[16:06] marry according to Uganda you are fit
[16:09] for marriage but not according to the
[16:11] laws of God the laws of God requires
[16:13] other things which we will look at but
[16:16] according to Uganda you are fit for
[16:17] marriage now how many are
[16:20] 17 17 and Below raise up your
[16:24] hand raise up up up up one two three now
[16:29] according to Uganda you cannot
[16:32] marry so according to our laws in this
[16:35] country it's not good for you to plan
[16:38] marriage now so if you are in any
[16:41] relationship you there is something
[16:43] wrong you understand so according to
[16:47] Uganda okay now when we come to the ways
[16:52] of God um marriage he says is
[16:57] Honorable
[16:59] marriage is Honorable in all and he says
[17:02] the bed
[17:05] undefiled meaning if you go to bed with
[17:09] someone that is not your
[17:12] wife or your husband that bed is defiled
[17:16] you yourself you are
[17:19] defiled we think that defilement what is
[17:22] defilement can someone explain to me

[17:56] defilement do you know what it is cuz I
[17:58] don't want to embarrass you you have
[18:00] heard of it so what is
[18:03] [Music]
[18:05] defilement okay for me
[18:08] defilement I understand it
[18:11] as
[18:16] like okay okay like I'm just going to
[18:20] give a
[18:22] scenario okay okay defilement is like
[18:26] destroying uh like let me say destroying
[18:29] your let me say your body with using
[18:33] Okay
[18:35] using okay by having these things of sex
[18:39] what to answer this
[18:43] question brother have you
[18:45] failed I have not failed you have not
[18:48] failed how many understood his
[18:51] explanation of
[18:52] defilement no one
[18:55] understood I want a sister who can help
[18:58] him
[18:59] a
[19:00] sister sister
[19:03] gift
[19:07] yes uhhuh Esther what is
[19:13] defilement
[19:19] yes H these are strong words but
[19:23] according to school this is true not so
[19:27] engaging into Affairs let me call it
[19:31] that way when you are below 18 years but
[19:36] according to
[19:37] God you have engaged in defilement if
[19:40] you are not
[19:42] married do you understand it's not
[19:46] according to God it's not age according
[19:47] to God it's when you are not married and
[19:50] you engage into such Affairs you have
[19:52] defiled yourself if you're 17 years and
[19:55] married according to God it's all right
[19:59] but if you are not married at
[20:02] 17 and you engag into such Affairs you
[20:05] are defiling yourself and defiling uh uh
[20:09] the bed but then he says war mongers and
[20:12] AD doubter us God will judge someone I
[20:15] said if you're 17 and said ah what what
[20:18] are you meaning that if you're 17 years
[20:20] according to the Bible you can't
[20:22] marry who says that you can't Mar if
[20:24] you're
[20:27] 17 well do you know that there are some
[20:30] countries who accept people to marry at
[20:33] 15
[20:35] so can they not marry in our country
[20:38] it's not accepted as a government rule
[20:41] but according to some other countries
[20:43] they can even put it higher or lower it
[20:46] depends on the country but according to
[20:48] the ways of God the laws of God it is
[20:51] when you are married when you're married
[20:53] if you're not married you are defiling
[20:55] yourself you are a warmonger and you are
[20:58] an adulterer or fornicator and he says
[21:01] God will
[21:03] judge so there is no good words I have
[21:06] about fornication today and I wanted to
[21:08] talk about it about fornication in
[21:10] itself and then we shall get into these
[21:13] questions because this is um one of the
[21:17] biggest
[21:18] Temptation that
[21:20] uh is with the young people me when I
[21:22] understood it when I was from the time I
[21:24] was young I decided myself to keep away
[21:28] from it now I'm going to read you a few
[21:31] scriptures together with you I'll tell
[21:34] you to open you open we read quickly we
[21:35] go to another one let's go to
[21:42] Matthew chapter 15:
[21:52] 19 are you there if you're there say
[21:56] amen for out of their heart proceed evil
[22:00] thoughts
[22:02] murders
[22:03] adulteries
[22:05] fornications thefts false witness
[22:09] blasphemies so where does fornication
[22:11] come
[22:13] from out out of
[22:16] where out of their heart not every type
[22:20] of heart a heart that has not been born
[22:22] again a heart that has not been filled
[22:24] with the Holy Spirit a heart that has
[22:26] not been changed
[22:28] now there are certain things you can do
[22:31] please give me attention kindly I'm
[22:34] requesting there are certain things you
[22:36] can do and you say it was a mistake I
[22:40] did not mean to do it for example like
[22:43] what like what
[22:47] yes something you will do and you say ha
[22:50] it was a mistake yes
[22:54] sister when you are seeing something
[22:57] stealing something you can steal
[22:59] something and say you did not mean to do
[23:01] it like for example like
[23:03] what stealing like what a
[23:08] car yes my
[23:11] sister when you lie H like which kind of
[23:18] lie
[23:21] hey yes you come home
[23:24] late mommy asks you
[23:26] yes
[23:30] yes you say that you are being at a
[23:33] responsible place so that you will fear
[23:35] to be
[23:36] punished H when do you think of doing
[23:39] that that moment or by the time you were
[23:42] coming you were planning it all
[23:44] along you plan it uhhuh you see so
[23:49] that's not a mistake okay so I want you
[23:51] to tell me something you can do that is
[23:53] bad by mistake
[23:56] yes throw down someone by mistake yes
[24:00] maybe you are walking and then you you
[24:02] you you know you you know you trip over
[24:05] something and then you push someone by
[24:06] mistake and ha they fall down and then
[24:08] you say I'm sorry I didn't mean it right
[24:12] that's a honest mistake yeah that is a
[24:15] very good example now you see it's a
[24:17] honest mistake but also there are
[24:19] certain sins you can do by mistake for
[24:22] example like
[24:23] what yes my sister huh like a abusing
[24:29] ahuh for example give us an
[24:34] example you know someone someone slaps
[24:39] you and then you slap back and then you
[24:42] say hey I'm sorry or maybe someone
[24:45] speaks at you and then yet they are
[24:47] bigger than you and you also want to
[24:48] speak back
[24:49] and what was I going to do see I'm sorry
[24:52] you see but even even if you've not done
[24:54] it but you almost did it so it is almost
[24:56] done it's a mistake
[24:58] now there are many things you can do
[25:00] even others which we have not mentioned
[25:01] really even in some some some
[25:04] circumstances fortunate even You Can
[25:06] Tell a Lie by mistake certain lies not
[25:08] every type of lie sincerely by
[25:11] mistake when you did not mean it or plan
[25:13] it but somehow you are caught in a in a
[25:16] rock and a hard place and you have no
[25:18] way to to come out of it then you end up
[25:19] saying ah then you realize her by the
[25:22] way like brother banam for example
[25:24] brother banam he was he had not paid tax
[25:27] so he was in a house and um the tax
[25:30] people called him and uh H he saw the
[25:33] call he knew I have not paid I'm not
[25:36] these people are going to ask me for
[25:37] money so he says he he quickly runs out
[25:40] of the house and he tells his wife pick
[25:42] it up and tell them I'm not at home I'm
[25:44] not in the house was he in the house no
[25:48] so it was a very honest lie
[25:52] right so the sister picked up the phone
[25:54] he said he's not
[25:56] in he's not in the house so now but the
[26:01] heart smot him within him he said I lied
[26:04] to that to that man he and then when
[26:06] they brought him a child or children a
[26:08] child who was sick to pray over at his
[26:11] home as he was going to pray the spirit
[26:14] of God spoke to him he said but you are
[26:15] a
[26:16] liar I cannot hear your prayers you are
[26:18] a
[26:19] liar he said he told the person the
[26:22] parent of the child I'm sorry I can't
[26:23] pray for your child now but later so he
[26:26] picked up his his car and drove to this
[26:28] place where to the man where he was and
[26:30] he said I'm sorry sir when you called at
[26:33] home I was actually in the house but I
[26:36] had to go out and I asked my wife to lie
[26:38] on my behalf I'm really sorry I
[26:41] lied and the man said Mr Bram I've
[26:43] trusted you all these years but what you
[26:46] have done has made me trust you more you
[26:50] see uh it was a lie but by mistake but
[26:53] it was a lie still you can even say he
[26:56] was not inside house house so it was not
[26:58] a lie how many times have we told such
[27:00] lies and then we thought God will cover
[27:02] it up no problem you see you have to be
[27:04] honest with God now why did I say that
[27:07] there are certain things you can do by
[27:09] mistake and you didn't mean to do them
[27:11] but you do it anyhow and then you repent
[27:13] later but there are certain sins you
[27:16] cannot do by mistake one of them is
[27:21] fornication are you following me you
[27:24] cannot fornicate by mistake by all means
[27:27] you it cannot happen by
[27:30] mistake you see he said it is a matter
[27:32] of what of the heart it proceedeth out
[27:37] of the
[27:38] heart you see in your heart you plan it
[27:41] in your heart you envision it in your
[27:44] heart you even plan the day the time the
[27:47] place
[27:49] everything it begins there you look at a
[27:52] person you you you you you last after
[27:53] them and yet the Bible says that the
[27:56] moment you last after someone you have
[27:58] already committed a doubted with them in
[28:00] your heart but for you you do it and
[28:03] you're not condemned when you come in
[28:04] the church the word is going on you you
[28:06] don't repent of it it means you are not
[28:10] ready to correct your way so you see sin
[28:15] please listen sin begins in the heart
[28:19] things like fornication sins like
[28:20] fornication begins in the heart it is a
[28:23] matter of the heart and the reason why
[28:26] I'm bringing this Foundation is because
[28:28] I don't want you to be surprised on the
[28:30] next scriptures we are going to read on
[28:32] fornication what the Bible say speaks of
[28:34] it mhm are you following are you
[28:39] following I hope there is no fornicator
[28:41] here because you're are
[28:42] quiet I'm not preaching because you're
[28:44] fornicating I'm preaching because I
[28:46] don't want you to fornicate so if you
[28:49] are so quiet you will surprise
[28:53] me are you listening church so things
[28:56] like fornication you don't do it by
[28:58] mistake you plan it
[29:01] brother I don't want to use an example
[29:03] because it may happen to you so brother
[29:06] so and so is there he begins looking at
[29:09] someone he begins imagining now I wish
[29:13] this and this and that would happen and
[29:15] this and that and then he puts all that
[29:17] thing in his head in his heart rather
[29:20] and he begins to fantasize about it when
[29:23] he's sleeping he thinks about it and
[29:25] eventually it happens as a
[29:28] dream and then you see that dream you
[29:31] know for the devil to overpower you he
[29:33] will come in that realm of dream he will
[29:34] first overpower your subconscious when
[29:37] you are sleeping and then when you wake
[29:40] up you are like H that girl I've seen
[29:42] her in my dreams you will even begin to
[29:44] spiritualize it it means God has given
[29:46] that to me and then you you begin to
[29:48] fantasize it you begin to fantasize the
[29:50] whole thing and then the next moment you
[29:52] begin asking can I have your contact
[29:56] there that is why I come to that point
[29:59] to tell you that any younger man asking
[30:03] for your
[30:06] contact is potentially a
[30:10] criminal is any younger man you brother
[30:13] you know yourself if you asking a girl
[30:16] for a contact before you talk to your
[30:18] pastor it is a sign that you on your way
[30:21] to
[30:22] fornication that spirit is hunting you
[30:25] why who knows we've SE many of them you
[30:28] ask for this one's contact this one is
[30:30] contact this one is contact you have
[30:32] like 10 sisters you are chatting with
[30:34] back and forth and each of them you are
[30:37] not making any substantial move the
[30:39] sister is there waiting patiently for
[30:41] her maybe she's honest she's thinking
[30:43] this brother could be the real deal that
[30:44] I was praying for but the brother has
[30:46] never been the real deal the brother has
[30:48] another spirit in him his heart is
[30:50] moving over him the moment and you see
[30:53] you even look at the time he's texting
[30:55] you it is in the weird hours of the
[30:56] night the brother other things are going
[30:58] over his mind he's fantasizing maybe he
[31:01] dreamed even about you he will tell you
[31:03] I dreamed of you and then you're like
[31:05] what did you dream of you yeah I saw
[31:06] this and that he will try to smear it
[31:08] around no one has a business of dreaming
[31:10] about you before they get the proper
[31:12] license to begin cting
[31:14] you now we talk these things after we
[31:18] talk it then you go and do it and then
[31:20] they say we don't teach you
[31:23] correctly let me tell you this is what
[31:26] is happening
[31:28] in this generation that we are living in
[31:30] it is very difficult by the way it is
[31:32] more difficult than it was 10 years ago
[31:34] it is be increasingly becoming more
[31:36] difficult because you see technology is
[31:39] bringing the world in one place in just
[31:41] a moment you can talk to anybody
[31:43] anywhere and there is even No Boundaries
[31:46] there is no boundaries of bedrooms there
[31:47] is no boundaries of because I mean you
[31:49] can just do a video call with somebody
[31:51] you know they see my bedroom no one will
[31:53] ever know it's just on the internet
[31:55] somewhere you see and and these things
[31:58] you see what is happening the devil is
[32:00] cooking you up for something you see the
[32:02] whole time this is going on you come in
[32:04] the church they preach against it and
[32:05] you you feel a bit of ner in you maybe
[32:08] that was wrong oh God forgive me you
[32:09] come here you repent and then you go
[32:11] back and begin from where you stopped
[32:14] because in your heart you are not right
[32:17] with God you know that song which says
[32:19] if my heart is right when he calls me if
[32:21] my heart is right I hear so you can't
[32:23] hear the voice of God because your heart
[32:25] within you there inside you you are not
[32:27] right with God you see there is
[32:29] something pushing you to do wrong you
[32:30] know it but you're not willing to
[32:32] correct it or to undo it and then from
[32:36] there your heart is pushing you and then
[32:38] you continue the conversation and
[32:40] eventually an opportunity presents
[32:42] itself there are some of you who have
[32:43] not even done this act simply because
[32:46] you have not found an
[32:48] opportunity but if an opportunity
[32:50] presented itself oh my God oh my God you
[32:53] yourself you know you would be in
[32:55] TS so but what causes it this is
[32:58] something which can easily be aborted
[33:01] the Bible speaks about Sin and he says
[33:03] you see sin is conceived like a pregnan
[33:05] like you conceive a pregnancy you know
[33:07] like a woman conceives a child in the
[33:09] womb sin is
[33:11] conceived it begins as a desire he says
[33:14] that God does not tempt any man but a
[33:17] man is tempted by his own what by his
[33:21] own L this scripture is in the Book of
[33:22] James if you want it brother you can put
[33:24] it up for us on the screen a man is
[33:26] tempted by his own last you last after
[33:30] you know the girl or the boy these days
[33:32] even girls are lasting after boys
[33:34] brother bam said in one of the quotes uh
[33:36] if a woman dresses you know half naked
[33:39] you know men will last after her but if
[33:41] a man dresses half naked meaning wearing
[33:43] a sh ah he has like e e legs are like
[33:49] how did he call it like iron BS or
[33:50] things like that he says no one will
[33:53] will last after it but I'm telling you
[33:55] things are changing that qut is old
[33:57] things are
[33:59] changing if you some brothers here came
[34:02] in in shorts you would find sisters
[34:04] uncomfortable because things are
[34:05] changing it did not used to be the case
[34:09] it it used to be that boys even
[34:11] secondary schools boys were going in
[34:13] shorts not so but things are changing
[34:15] now you see girls these days they also
[34:18] last after boys seriously and seriously
[34:20] I'm telling you they even ask for their
[34:22] contacts you find a sister asking you
[34:23] brother can I have your contact and you
[34:26] gladly give it and vice versa that is
[34:30] already already a wrong act the moment
[34:32] someone asks for your contact from the
[34:34] blue it is already a red flag it is
[34:37] already a red flag I'm telling you
[34:39] Brethren it is already a red flag if you
[34:42] are talking now all of you who have
[34:44] phones you know if you are talking to a
[34:46] sister or sister let me tell
[34:49] you if a brother is talking to you
[34:51] currently and you're not aware whether
[34:54] their father or their Pastor is aware
[34:56] that they are talking to you it is a red
[34:59] flag it is most likely that that young
[35:02] man is going to lead you into
[35:04] trouble so I'm telling you that's a red
[35:08] flag because this person all the things
[35:10] are happening secretly he may even lie
[35:12] to you my pastor is already aware I talk
[35:13] to him confirm yourself confirm go to
[35:17] that Pastor or go to your pastor and
[35:19] tell them by the way brother so and so
[35:21] brother Dixon from dvf contacted me and
[35:25] he said that his Pastor is aware are you
[35:27] aware your pastor would say no I'm not
[35:29] aware okay I'll talk to his pastor and
[35:32] he will talk to his Pastor said no I'm
[35:34] not aware hey you already know you are
[35:37] trapped but what do you do you don't
[35:40] contact your pastor because you think
[35:42] you are safe and then eventually when
[35:44] they play around with you and your heart
[35:46] is broken then you begin crying around
[35:48] brothers from that church they are very
[35:50] bad but you yourself you're also bad
[35:52] you're to blame you see your heart you
[35:55] did not protect your heart from evil
[35:57] you see whoever contacts you and you you
[35:59] don't do due diligence you begin
[36:01] responding you begin answering you begin
[36:03] doing this and then automatically you
[36:05] find yourself entrapped in that kind and
[36:07] you know you will be entrapped I'm
[36:08] telling you because your heart is soft
[36:10] sisters protect your hearts your hearts
[36:12] are very soft protect
[36:14] them put a gate on the padlock don't
[36:17] allow anyone to come in without proper
[36:20] license sisters should say Amen to that
[36:24] but then you find then this brother they
[36:27] begin contacting they begin talking you
[36:29] see these boys of this generation are
[36:32] I'm sorry to use this word on the pulpit
[36:34] but it's the truth many of them not all
[36:36] of them I hope there is none here but
[36:38] many of them are Crooks I'm telling you
[36:39] the truth many of them are Crooks they
[36:41] are not serious Christians many of them
[36:43] are not sincere you know you find them
[36:46] contacting more than one sister and they
[36:49] they're not even deciding over who to
[36:51] choose and if you are among them and you
[36:53] are here you need the Holy Spirit I'm
[36:55] telling you you need to fight find God
[36:58] until you do that you will never find a
[37:00] wife because you cannot find a wife by
[37:01] trying this one trying this one trying
[37:03] that you are the type that I saw on the
[37:06] social media they put a mango and they
[37:08] said you see these people are just
[37:09] trying on every mango and then
[37:10] eventually they trying to find the right
[37:12] one all mango they have eaten a piece
[37:14] out of them you see so you are the one
[37:16] who is trying every mango every mango
[37:18] you are the one who knows that sister is
[37:19] good that one is bad that one is this
[37:21] but you did not choose any of them and
[37:23] you these days even younger men are one
[37:26] passing the rumors you find passing Tes
[37:30] the rumor to this one even a brother who
[37:32] would have potentially married you they
[37:34] will ruin him and his heart he will lose
[37:37] interest because of the rumor boys are
[37:39] moving rumors what type of men do are we
[37:41] going to to raise in the Next Generation
[37:44] in my generation you could not find a
[37:46] boy or a man moving rumors that is a
[37:48] Taboo it's an Abomination a man moving
[37:51] rumors it is it is UNS serious Brethren
[37:55] younger men we should you should be men
[37:57] of purpose you should be men who have a
[37:59] future you should be men who are
[38:01] planning great and bigger things when
[38:03] you begin as a sister the very first
[38:07] spot before you even do that we are
[38:09] going to come to that but now
[38:12] fornication is is planned in the heart
[38:16] this is something that does not happen
[38:17] by mistake that's why I'm I'm here to
[38:20] encourage you if you think that
[38:21] fornication will catch you it cannot
[38:23] catch you it can there is no way it can
[38:25] catch you unless you you you you are
[38:26] backers lead you first back SL before
[38:29] fornication catches you you cannot you
[38:31] cannot believe and follow the word and
[38:33] do everything the Bible saying and then
[38:35] be caught by fornication you'll be
[38:36] tempted to to go and do it but you
[38:38] cannot do it if you don't go in its
[38:42] areas and Realms are you following
[38:46] me now I'm I'm speaking to you not
[38:50] according to knowledge but according to
[38:51] experience and testimony because I know
[38:54] I've gone through it I've I've gone
[38:57] through my own share of Temptations but
[38:59] God sailed me through and I did not have
[39:02] any
[39:03] breezes which means it is possible and
[39:06] uh whenever we talk about this I
[39:08] understand there are some of course not
[39:09] all we can say that have lived
[39:11] virtuously some of you may be in one uh
[39:14] area of your life when you are not
[39:15] serious with God you found yourself
[39:16] trapped and ENT trapped and have walked
[39:18] that kind of life but you see let that
[39:21] be your past don't let it come in your
[39:22] present and say well I did it before
[39:24] nothing happened ah after you have come
[39:26] to the Lord and you want to continue
[39:27] doing it you will see what will happen
[39:29] you can't be the same you see if the
[39:31] moment you come to Jesus Christ then the
[39:32] Bible says all those that mention oh
[39:35] mention the name of Jesus they should
[39:36] depart from Evil you cannot mention the
[39:39] name of Jesus and still walk in the same
[39:41] old evil you used to walk in before you
[39:43] came to Christ you cannot you see the
[39:46] conversations you used to walk in before
[39:48] you decide you make a decision you see
[39:50] by the Christianity is a choice
[39:52] Christianity is a choice it is not
[39:54] forced it is a choice I hope there is
[39:57] nobody here forced to follow the Bible
[40:00] right it's a choice that you make and
[40:03] once you make a choice to follow Christ
[40:05] then leave the principles of
[40:07] Christianity and you will you won't find
[40:09] it hard to live a Christian Life okay
[40:12] let us read a few more scriptures about
[40:14] fornication
[40:16] uhhuh vers
[40:22] John chapter sorry sorry not John Acts
[40:25] chapter 15 verse
[40:27] 20 but that but that we write unto them
[40:33] that they
[40:34] abstain from
[40:37] what from
[40:40] pollutions of
[40:42] idols and from from fornication and from
[40:48] things strangled and from
[40:50] blood now meaning all these things are
[40:53] Abominations to a Christian to a
[40:55] believer you should abstain who knows
[40:58] what abstaining
[41:04] means
[41:05] sorry brother poap your city was

[41:16] already married they have just come to
[41:18] watch and see what is happening you come

[41:24] what does abstaining mean brother poap
[41:26] tell
[41:28] us
[41:30] what's keep away keep away God bless you
[41:34] abstaining is to do what keep away keep
[41:37] away meaning abstaining is to decide you
[41:41] can can you keep away from something
[41:43] unless you have decided
[41:44] to you decide first to keep away from
[41:48] something and then you will keep away he
[41:50] says
[41:51] abstain from fornication I'm reading you
[41:54] a few more scriptures on this matter
[41:57] and then he continues on and he says
[42:00] here in the book of um 1 Corinthians
[42:04] chapter
[42:09] 5 vers
[42:12] uh can someone read that for us oh
[42:15] brother put it for me on the screen 1
[42:17] Corinthians chapter 5 verse1 quickly now
[42:19] I need it on the screen I'm going to ask
[42:21] you to be putting the scriptures on the
[42:22] screen so if you are first it will help
[42:25] me it it is reported commonly that there
[42:28] is fornication among
[42:31] you and such fornication as it is not so
[42:35] much as named among the Gentiles that
[42:38] one should have his father's
[42:41] wife what is the next
[42:44] verse what what does the next verse
[42:49] say yes read
[42:51] it get a
[42:53] microphone give him a microphone

[43:16] happening just

[43:22] [Music]
[43:25] okay
[43:26] and yet here pu up and have not rather
[43:29] moured that he that have done this deed
[43:31] might be taken away from among
[43:34] you what did he
[43:37] say ye that have done what and yet you
[43:40] are puffed up uhuh and have not rather
[43:44] mourned that he that had done this deed
[43:46] might be taken continue away from among
[43:49] you
[43:50] continue for I verily as absent in body
[43:54] but present in spirit have judged
[43:56] already
[43:59] mhm
[44:02] continue as
[44:04] though I was present concerning him that
[44:07] has so done this deed um let's go up a
[44:11] bit up a little
[44:13] bit uh that verse two and ye are paed up
[44:17] and have not rather mourned that ye that
[44:20] has done this deed might be taken away
[44:22] from among you I want to ask you a
[44:23] question do you know what they did for a
[44:26] person that fornicated in the Old
[44:28] Testament who
[44:30] knows what they do stoned killed
[44:36] physically murdered them H how bad would
[44:40] that would that have been before God God
[44:44] did not forgive people who had
[44:46] fornicated they were murdered they were
[44:48] killed done away with now it shows you
[44:52] how much God hated it defilement you see
[44:56] he hated it even more than he
[45:04] hated it is Li that they would separate
[45:07] somebody for a while until he is well
[45:10] right they would not kill aaper but they
[45:12] would kill a
[45:14] foror because God hated it and here in
[45:17] the New Testament Paul is saying you you
[45:19] have done fornication and you are still
[45:21] puffed up you you are still lifting
[45:25] yourself up you you are not having any
[45:27] remorse you're not you not apologetic
[45:28] you are not repentant instead of
[45:30] mourning and taking away these people
[45:32] from among you that have done this thing
[45:33] you've not done it you've not done it
[45:36] did you know that one fornicator in the
[45:39] church can bring in a thousand
[45:41] demons did you know that you literally
[45:45] walk into the church and many demons

[51:36] flee like brother Solomon you have to do
[51:40] it energetic you don't even think twice
[51:43] you don't look twice that's why
[51:44] Believers Brothers let me tell you how
[51:46] to flee when you are walking on the road
[51:48] it is all over us you not going to to
[51:50] people are walking naked every day right
[51:52] almost you find them wearing their
[51:54] pajamas on the road what are you going
[51:55] to do huh are you going to be burning
[51:58] the whole time because you saw them and
[51:59] you a Believer what are you going to
[52:03] do yes even for people as young as Billy
[52:06] Paul I know what I'm talking about I'm a
[52:09] pastor I meet these younger people and
[52:11] they tell you things and you get shocked
[52:14] surprised what are you going to do when
[52:15] you find them naked walking on the road
[52:19] the moment you were walking you see them
[52:22] of course the first seeing was by
[52:24] mistake go back to what we started with
[52:27] but if you go back and say what did I
[52:30] see you are
[52:32] gone actually when you reach home begin
[52:35] repenting asking God to wash you because
[52:38] you have already committed fornication
[52:39] in your heart you see that's what that's
[52:42] where the first you see if you're a
[52:44] child of God you will be judged in your
[52:46] heart to begin with before you even ever
[52:48] try to do the
[52:49] act now how do you flee if you look
[52:53] once go don't look twice
[52:56] if you feel that your your head is so
[52:58] heavy you are working with a brother
[53:01] come here brother you're walking with a
[53:03] brother and your head is so heavy you
[53:05] want to turn again tell the brother
[53:07] brother hold my head this side please
[53:10] hold it keep my head this side I'm
[53:12] trying to look turn turn The Other Side
[53:14] now you you are holding my
[53:17] shoulders hold my head I'm turning but
[53:19] brother hold it at least a brother
[53:22] should hold it you understand God bless
[53:24] you don't hold it forever my
[53:28] brother so that is the way my brethren
[53:31] of fleeing from fornication sisters how
[53:35] do you
[53:35] flee when you receive a text message you
[53:38] don't know the background of that text
[53:40] message I encourage you not to answer
[53:42] that text message hey Pastor are you
[53:45] putting not putting us in prison are you
[53:46] saying that our phones we are going to
[53:48] be talking to only our father mother and
[53:51] sisters Pastor you are making it very
[53:54] hard
[53:55] how many agree with me now on what I
[53:57] just said I'm making it very hard yeah
[54:00] you not raising up your hand but that's
[54:02] what you are thinking in your heart but
[54:04] let me tell you H it does not mean that
[54:08] because you've been walking right with
[54:11] god um you are going to be we call it
[54:15] friends if that was to be the fact how
[54:18] come that we've had so many that have
[54:20] fallen into mistake and error that
[54:23] otherwise they would have missed but but
[54:25] they found themselves trapped you will
[54:28] trap yourself because you did not
[54:31] flee I have a sister I I really like her
[54:33] she's in in Kenya when a brother
[54:36] contacts her and he doesn't know about
[54:42] him uh he will ask her he will ask him
[54:45] who are
[54:46] you I'm so are you not the ones who are
[54:49] passing through the
[54:51] ventilators meaning he's saying if you
[54:54] are me I don't know you and my pastor
[54:57] should tell me about it before you
[54:58] contact me so who are you why are you
[54:59] contacting me what are you saying are
[55:01] you not the ones who are passing through
[55:02] the ventilators because the past the
[55:04] door to the ship is who the shepherd so
[55:07] sincerely I think that that sister is
[55:09] right if a brother wants to contact you
[55:14] in well if he wants to greet you
[55:16] normally to as a friend no problem
[55:19] that's why we have church more right so
[55:22] we can meet one another and GRE one
[55:24] another not sister are you agreeing with
[55:27] me we meet each other at church we greet
[55:31] why do you ask for my number so I can
[55:33] keep greeting you you will keep greeting
[55:34] me just keep coming to church you will
[55:37] find me at church right but you want my
[55:41] number so you can begin passing through
[55:42] the ventilators go through the door if
[55:45] you really want to to know me more go
[55:48] through the door as we shall see it
[55:50] quickly now let let me read a few more
[55:52] on this and then I conclude this
[55:54] one
[56:01] Ephesians chapter
[56:03] 5 the by there are so many scriptures
[56:06] about fornication you'll be surprised
[56:08] and so many pre so few preachers talk
[56:11] about against it and yet it is so much
[56:14] talked about in the New Testament you'll
[56:16] be so surprised uh Ephesians chapter 5
[56:23] verse3 before we read that let us read
[56:25] Galatians 5:19 which says now the works
[56:28] of the flesh are
[56:31] manifest which are these number one
[56:35] adultery number two fornication number
[56:39] three uncleanness number four
[56:41] lasciviousness and others and he says we
[56:43] should avoid them and now in Ephesians
[56:45] 5:3 he says but
[56:48] fornication and all
[56:50] uncleanness or
[56:52] covetousness let it it be mentioned
[56:57] among you just a few times is that
[57:00] aen is that
[57:02] aen what did he
[57:05] say let it not be
[57:08] once
[57:11] once named among you as becometh
[57:17] Saints praise
[57:20] God neither fithness no foolish talking
[57:23] no jesting which are not convenient but
[57:25] rather giving of
[57:28] thanks praise God now if some of you who
[57:32] say I can do it once in a while and then
[57:34] I Repent he says let it not be mentioned
[57:37] this one should not even be he did not
[57:39] say lies he said
[57:40] fornication Li is as bad right but here
[57:44] he's talking about fornication it should
[57:45] not be mentioned among in your life not
[57:48] even one time not even one
[57:50] time so to those of you who was a guilty
[57:55] of that it is not you are no longer
[57:56] guilty as we had this morning it is in
[57:58] your past you've got a new chapter with
[58:01] Jesus Christ and that is how you should
[58:03] keep it it shouldn't be mentioned in
[58:05] your life once whatever was done in your
[58:08] past is under the sea of forgetfulness
[58:10] and God remembers it no more and
[58:12] repentance if you repented it means you
[58:13] will no longer and never go back to it
[58:17] again all right now there is a scripture
[58:21] that I wanted to read before I leave
[58:22] this uh subject here
[58:28] um Can someone uh point me to that
[58:32] scripture is it this one which I was
[58:34] reading that says if a brother is a
[58:36] fornicator you should not even eat with
[58:48] him okay as you are finding it for us
[58:50] let us read first Thessalonians chapter
[58:52] 4 vers um
[59:00] vers three someone find me the other
[59:02] scripture for this is the will of God
[59:04] even your sanctification that you should
[59:07] abstain from
[59:10] fornication that every one of you should
[59:12] know how to possess his vessel in
[59:16] sanctification and in honor where is
[59:18] Your
[59:20] Vessel where is Your Vessel
[59:23] Brethren you don't know Your
[59:26] Vessel your body your body is a vessel
[59:29] should be a vessel for
[59:32] honor and so you should know how to
[59:34] possess your vessel in sanctification
[59:35] and in honor not in the last of
[59:39] consu consience I don't know the
[59:42] pronunciation even as the
[59:45] Gentiles which know which he says even
[59:48] as the Gentiles which know not God
[59:51] because by that to the unbelievers this
[59:53] is a very small thing it's like we they
[59:55] even have words which they call a one
[59:57] night stand how many have heard such
[59:59] words you are so holy that you don't and
[1:00:02] have never heard that word they have
[1:00:04] them and because to them it's not a big
[1:00:07] deal you know it's a you know so but to
[1:00:10] us it should not be because our vessel
[1:00:12] should be a vels of horor now that word
[1:00:15] which I could not pronounce properly
[1:00:16] means strong sexual desire not in the
[1:00:19] last o of that even as the Gentiles
[1:00:22] which know not God because because
[1:00:24] that's how they are you see for them
[1:00:27] they live in lust they live in consience
[1:00:30] or strong sexual desire that no man go
[1:00:33] beyond and defoud his brother in any
[1:00:35] matter because that the Lord is the
[1:00:38] Avenger of all such as we also have for
[1:00:42] warned you and testified for God has not
[1:00:44] called us unto uncleanness but unto
[1:00:47] Holiness he there that despises despises
[1:00:50] not man but God who has also given unto
[1:00:53] us his Holy Spirit praise the Lord did
[1:00:58] you find that other
[1:01:01] scripture
[1:01:12] yes okay I think it 1 Corinthians chter
[1:01:15] 5:1
[1:01:20] um so if you could not find it means you
[1:01:22] don't know these things so it is good
[1:01:24] that you are hearing them
[1:01:25] now okay let let me begin reading from
[1:01:29] verse 7 Purge out there the old Liv that
[1:01:34] ye may be a new lamp as ye are
[1:01:38] unleavened for even Christ Our Passover
[1:01:41] is sacrificed for us therefore let us
[1:01:44] keep the feast not with the old living
[1:01:47] neither with the living of malice and
[1:01:49] wickedness but with the unli bread of
[1:01:51] sincerity and Truth
[1:01:55] I wrote unto you in an epistle not to
[1:01:59] company meaning not to associate are you
[1:02:03] hearing me church if you're hearing me
[1:02:04] say
[1:02:06] Amen if someone is a fornicator around
[1:02:08] you they will be shocked if you say Amen
[1:02:10] which means you are living that cohort
[1:02:12] you're going into another cohort so
[1:02:14] listen to me I wrote unto you in an epis
[1:02:17] not to company meaning not to associate
[1:02:19] with fornicators or sexual immoral
[1:02:22] people not to associate with fornicator
[1:02:24] can we say Amen to
[1:02:26] that now he says yet not all together
[1:02:29] with the fornicators of this world don't
[1:02:31] say oh your boss is a fornicator so you
[1:02:33] cannot associate with him you don't even
[1:02:34] want to take his instructions because
[1:02:37] he's a fornicator no he's saying not all
[1:02:40] together the fornicators of this world
[1:02:43] or the coers or the extortioners or with
[1:02:45] the idolators for then must ye needs to
[1:02:48] go out of the world but now I have
[1:02:51] written unto you not to keep Company If
[1:02:55] any man that is called a brother be a
[1:02:58] fornicator If any man that is called a
[1:03:01] brother be a fornicator that also means
[1:03:03] if any woman be called a sister be a
[1:03:07] fornicator is the same thing it goes the
[1:03:08] same way don't say sisters we have we
[1:03:10] are not involved here you are involved
[1:03:12] as well you see if any man that is
[1:03:15] called a brother be a fornicator or
[1:03:17] cesious or an idolator or a raer or a
[1:03:20] drunkard an extortioner with such an one
[1:03:23] no not to eat meaning if a brother is a
[1:03:28] fornicator we already know what these
[1:03:30] things mean I I'm I'm not going to go
[1:03:32] into the explanations if a brother is a
[1:03:34] fornicator according to the scripture we
[1:03:37] are not even allowed to associate with
[1:03:40] them to eat even together with them in
[1:03:42] the same
[1:03:43] table did you know
[1:03:46] that if we cannot eat with them in the
[1:03:48] same table in our homes how much more in
[1:03:52] the
[1:03:52] church that means means they are not
[1:03:55] even allowed in the
[1:03:57] fellowship that means according to this
[1:03:59] scripture they are
[1:04:02] excommunicated you mean is that serious
[1:04:04] yes it is that serious if someone is
[1:04:07] called a brother or a
[1:04:08] Believer a Christian and yet is living
[1:04:11] immorally doing this doing that going
[1:04:14] with this one going with that one or not
[1:04:16] only that or a drunker a drun this guy
[1:04:19] who is drinking and then you know he
[1:04:21] gets drunk or he also has here whatever
[1:04:24] an
[1:04:26] extortioner an do you know who an
[1:04:28] extortioner
[1:04:29] is
[1:04:31] huh an ex is somebody who takes money by
[1:04:35] force or someone who steals people's
[1:04:38] money I
[1:04:47] think and they don't pay borrow me and
[1:04:49] they don't pay borrow me and they don't
[1:04:51] borrow me and they don't pay borrow me I
[1:04:53] will pay tomorrow and they don't pay
[1:04:56] borrow me brother they don't pay he goes
[1:04:57] to this brother he goes to that brother
[1:04:59] he goes to that let me tell you once you
[1:05:00] find such someone like that it should be
[1:05:02] brought and that person should be
[1:05:04] corrected if he can't correct himself he
[1:05:06] should
[1:05:08] be
[1:05:10] disassociated why I don't know God said
[1:05:13] so why because if he's not disassociated
[1:05:16] he will also make others like
[1:05:20] him yes it is that serious don't keep
[1:05:24] company with such people for what have I
[1:05:26] to
[1:05:27] do judge them also that are without why
[1:05:30] do I judge those ones who are not
[1:05:31] Believers or who are not among us but I
[1:05:34] judge them that are within those ones
[1:05:36] who are in the house of God they are my
[1:05:38] brothers they are my I will judge them I
[1:05:40] will judge them that's what Paul is
[1:05:42] saying but them but them that are
[1:05:45] without God will judge those ones who
[1:05:47] are not in the church God will judge but
[1:05:49] those ones who are in the church I
[1:05:50] should judge
[1:05:51] them therefore put away from among
[1:05:54] yourself that Wicked person
[1:05:57] hey that Wicked person that brother who
[1:06:00] is very
[1:06:04] busy I've seen those kind of behaviors
[1:06:07] those people who are
[1:06:23] like
[1:06:45] so which means it is serious for someone
[1:06:47] to be a drun for someone to be a raer
[1:06:50] for someone do you know who a raer is AA
[1:06:53] is a rev you know an idolator aous
[1:06:59] person someone someone who complains or
[1:07:02] protest strongly and persistently about
[1:07:04] something me even the way I'm seeing
[1:07:07] things in the church even this one even
[1:07:09] that one there are people like that who
[1:07:10] complain even the music I don't like the
[1:07:12] way sh plays the
[1:07:15] ways I don't like I don't even enjoy
[1:07:17] everything I don't know there's a
[1:07:19] problem in the church have you never
[1:07:21] seen people like that those AR rers we
[1:07:23] should not associate with them don't
[1:07:25] make them your friends disassociate
[1:07:27] yourself with such people why because
[1:07:29] they will also make you like
[1:07:31] them we should be positiv minded in the
[1:07:34] work of God we we should not be
[1:07:37] idolators or cous do you know a cous
[1:07:39] person a person
[1:07:41] who showing us a great desire to possess
[1:07:44] something belonging to someone
[1:07:49] else look at that I wish I'd get it it
[1:07:52] is not yours calm down down H you should
[1:07:56] you see oh I wish I was married look at
[1:07:59] that sister for example for
[1:08:02] sure
[1:08:04] sincerely you are
[1:08:07] cous someone tells you that this is the
[1:08:09] sister
[1:08:10] brother Andrew is going to marry and You

[1:08:17] you see look for your sister look for
[1:08:20] your wife look for your own is Cal
[1:08:25] and people other people you you know
[1:08:27] that fornicators you also say
[1:08:29] fornicators now people like this
[1:08:31] according to the Bible the scripture has
[1:08:34] been very clear that we should not
[1:08:37] accompany with them we should take away
[1:08:41] such Wicked people from among our Mist
[1:08:44] now that is as far as not the very many
[1:08:46] scriptures I've not talked about but as
[1:08:48] far as this meeting is concerned that's
[1:08:50] as much as I can talk about fornication
[1:08:52] and I will tell you what God hates it
[1:08:54] you can see clearly through the
[1:08:55] scriptures God hates it but then again
[1:08:59] marriage the Bible says as I began is
[1:09:01] Honorable okay marriage is Honorable the
[1:09:04] feelings that God put in your body yes
[1:09:06] there's a deep calling there must be a
[1:09:08] deep to respond and um uh do not if you

[1:09:23] people because you're excited then you
[1:09:25] begin to you know some brothers some
[1:09:27] younger men when they overwhelmed by
[1:09:29] their

[1:09:38] youth there is someone who
[1:09:41] wrote a paper and he said you know I'm a
[1:09:43] youth and then he was asking a question
[1:09:45] you see it is true you a youth and when
[1:09:48] your body overwhelms you others no to be
[1:09:50] able to calm down I need to find someone
[1:09:52] I can always be calling and calm down
[1:09:54] myself sincerely that's how you're going

[1:09:58] it brother Patrick that's not the right
[1:10:01] way huh Brother

[1:10:28] B you have a
[1:10:30] phone okay so do you also call some
[1:10:33] people to calm yourself
[1:10:35] down you find you see these younger
[1:10:38] people do that you know said now let me
[1:10:40] call some even sisters now I feel I need
[1:10:43] to have a brother so I can always be
[1:10:45] talking to him I'm not intending to
[1:10:47] marry them but just to calm myself down
[1:10:49] you know to relax and it's a wrong
[1:10:51] spirit it's a spirit of fornication
[1:10:53] knocking on your
[1:10:54] door that's not the way to do it if you
[1:10:57] want to calm yourself down come to the
[1:10:59] Lord Jesus come and pray this is what we
[1:11:03] used to do you go and
[1:11:14] pray of course you will and you fast and
[1:11:17] you get energy you'll be now on fire
[1:11:19] after some time again you'll go
[1:11:22] down
[1:11:24] until you overcome you understand don't
[1:11:27] give up don't give up don't give up on
[1:11:30] on Holiness don't give up on the word of
[1:11:32] God don't give up on your future because
[1:11:34] fornication is one number one killer of
[1:11:36] Christians do you know why Christians
[1:11:38] don't Prosper Christians don't Prosper
[1:11:40] because they are the
[1:11:42] most they are the biggest
[1:11:46] Hypocrites do you know why the people in
[1:11:48] the world like Muslims Prosper
[1:11:50] financially because they don't live in
[1:11:52] hypocrisy
[1:11:56] so Pastor should we be Muslims well they
[1:11:58] don't have the blessing of God upon
[1:12:00] their life the blessing of God maketh
[1:12:02] rich and he adds no sorrow upon it they
[1:12:04] have a lot of sorrow in all the
[1:12:05] prosperity they have attained or have
[1:12:08] accumulated but if you have the blessing
[1:12:10] of God it will make you rich both
[1:12:11] spiritually and physically but here is a
[1:12:20] Muslim he will as many as he wishes and
[1:12:24] afford even Catholics do by the way and
[1:12:29] anglicans and some Pentecostal these
[1:12:31] days are also doing it including pastors
[1:12:35] right but the Believers should not you
[1:12:40] see you find your one and you stay with
[1:12:43] that one you stick with that one some of
[1:12:45] us decided long time ago by the way it
[1:12:47] has to be a decision if you don't make a
[1:12:49] decision it won't happen some of you
[1:12:50] even fear to talk about marriage you
[1:12:52] have to make a decision now now before
[1:12:54] that time so that when you've made up
[1:12:56] your mind God will give you your desire
[1:12:59] according to your heart's desire you
[1:13:00] make up your mind I'm going to marry and
[1:13:02] I'm going to marry one wife and I will
[1:13:04] stick with her and I will love her and I
[1:13:05] will give her everything and I will just
[1:13:07] be everything I can to her same thing to
[1:13:10] you sister you say I'm not going to
[1:13:12] defile myself with anybody with anything
[1:13:14] until I get married and when I get
[1:13:16] married I must marry a child of God a
[1:13:19] Son of God now you see these are
[1:13:21] decisions you make really early in life
[1:13:23] if you don't consider this as a value
[1:13:26] you don't take it as a value you're
[1:13:27] going to meet a lot of people in the
[1:13:28] world that don't see it as a value so
[1:13:31] what are you going to do are you going
[1:13:32] to devalue your value to their value we
[1:13:34] have a value and the value we have is a
[1:13:36] word of God this is a tunnel it's a
[1:13:38] tunnel what are you going to replace it
[1:13:40] with with a gibberish that is in the
[1:13:42] world with the other things that do not
[1:13:45] have value on
[1:13:47] them I say thank God for the word
[1:13:49] because it puts value on everything that
[1:13:51] we do and I find that believers who are
[1:13:53] married properly have a lot of Peace
[1:13:55] have a lot of um you know when you talk
[1:13:59] to people especially people who've been
[1:14:01] married and have had issues in their
[1:14:03] marriage you really get a burden for the
[1:14:06] Young Generation you say what are they
[1:14:08] going if you make one wrong decision you
[1:14:11] have made many wrong right decisions and
[1:14:12] many wrong ones as well but this one
[1:14:15] when you make it in your life it will
[1:14:17] affect your life forever if you marry
[1:14:19] wrong wrongly or if you enter into
[1:14:22] fornications adulteries even after
[1:14:24] marriage if you enter into adultery it's
[1:14:26] the same thing and the spirit of lust is
[1:14:30] not cured by marriage how many can say
[1:14:32] Amen to
[1:14:33] that if you have a spirit of last don't
[1:14:36] think that when you marry the Bible says
[1:14:39] if you burn
[1:14:40] marry marriage does not cure burning
[1:14:44] rather last marriage does not do it what
[1:14:48] does cure it is the holy spirit that's
[1:14:51] why you should be filled with the Holy
[1:14:53] Spirit before you begin looking for a
[1:14:54] wife because if you look for a wife
[1:14:56] based on the lust that you have in your
[1:14:58] body you will pick the wrong one and
[1:15:00] when you pick the wrong one again she
[1:15:02] will ruin your life and then again you
[1:15:04] will continue you'll continue so you
[1:15:05] will now continue living in adultery
[1:15:07] remember he says War mongers fornicate
[1:15:09] us an adulterers God will judge even
[1:15:11] after marriage when you continue living
[1:15:13] as an adulterer still there is Judgment
[1:15:16] that comes to that but we as Believers
[1:15:19] we know that marriage is not a sin
[1:15:20] marriage is one of the best thing
[1:15:22] brother bam said it the second best
[1:15:24] thing to Salvation how many are saved
[1:15:27] here if you're saved H God should give
[1:15:32] you a wife as the next best
[1:15:35] gift now me I have my next best gift
[1:15:38] brother back there has his next best
[1:15:44] gifton has his next best gift right who
[1:15:47] else is married
[1:15:49] here yeah even brother also your phone
[1:15:52] your next best gift right or are you
[1:15:54] changing your mind now you have found
[1:15:57] now some of you have not found that
[1:16:00] second next best gift so you are not
[1:16:03] very rich until you find that next best
[1:16:05] gift at the right time in the right way
[1:16:08] in the right approach now I'm not going
[1:16:10] to go through quotes through what I'm
[1:16:12] just going to read you um uh give you
[1:16:15] this as a statement we go to the
[1:16:17] questions maybe there's a quote I wanted
[1:16:20] to read may God help me because I don't
[1:16:22] want to keep you long now um there is
[1:16:26] this um number one people have asked me
[1:16:29] often times what then how should we
[1:16:33] approach marriage what are the best what
[1:16:35] are the right what is the right
[1:16:37] procedure for marriage the right
[1:16:39] procedure for marriage of course it is
[1:16:41] based on the Eastern people because this
[1:16:44] Bible is based on the Eastern or
[1:16:45] oriental people the approach the way
[1:16:48] they married and we find that we are
[1:16:50] following that number one the thing that
[1:16:52] is is going to happen is courtship now
[1:16:55] in courtship under courtship a lot of
[1:16:56] things happen of course a decision is
[1:16:59] made under or when you approaching
[1:17:02] marriage when you want to do courtship
[1:17:04] for example you you have loved my
[1:17:06] daughter and um you want to marry her
[1:17:09] what do you do I want a very sharp
[1:17:12] brother to tell me what you
[1:17:15] do yes brother
[1:17:19] Dixon
[1:17:21] huh you got your
[1:17:24] okay now when we talk about decisions
[1:17:27] and courtship of course brother bam in
[1:17:29] some other quot he says that a man must
[1:17:32] first pray of course a husband or a wife
[1:17:35] comes from prayer that one I just wanted
[1:17:37] to underline that as the very first step
[1:17:40] you don't find wives in matchmaking some
[1:17:42] people are very good matchmakers
[1:17:45] hi do you know a
[1:17:48] Matchmaker you don't
[1:17:50] know you come I tell you what a
[1:17:52] Matchmaker is a
[1:17:54] Matchmaker a
[1:17:56] matchmaker is someone who who comes and
[1:17:59] tells you brother Billy you're ready for
[1:18:01] marriage you come out tell you
[1:18:04] son is that sister there don't you see
[1:18:07] her
[1:18:08] eyes what do you
[1:18:11] think you
[1:18:13] see what do you
[1:18:16] think and then you yeah there are
[1:18:19] listening listening listening and then
[1:18:21] eventually he said by the way
[1:18:23] way so then he he leaves you there then
[1:18:26] he goes to the other
[1:18:28] sister when he comes to the sister he
[1:18:31] will tell
[1:18:33] her sister what do you think the other
[1:18:36] brother is of mine he has said that blah
[1:18:39] blah blah blah blah blah blah what do
[1:18:40] you
[1:18:41] think and then after he has talked to
[1:18:44] this one he has talked to this one then
[1:18:49] he he he he watches them while
[1:18:51] encouraging them
[1:18:56] and then eventually that they should
[1:18:57] marry one another God Bless you that's
[1:18:59] matchmaking now marriage is not made by
[1:19:03] matchmaking marriage it is God to do the
[1:19:06] match making there must be a matchmaking
[1:19:10] God matching the two people but it is
[1:19:12] God who matches them not a man right and
[1:19:16] it is done through
[1:19:18] prayer through prayer you don't pray
[1:19:23] after you have found your
[1:19:25] March you pray
[1:19:27] before there are chances that if you
[1:19:29] pray after what are you praying for you
[1:19:32] are going to make the wrong decision
[1:19:33] because you praying under the
[1:19:36] influence of the last of your heart or
[1:19:39] flesh or whatever it is there are
[1:19:42] chances that whatever advice and canel
[1:19:44] you will be given you will never accept
[1:19:46] it because you have already made up your
[1:19:48] mind but if you pray before you approach
[1:19:52] if you pray pray before you see anybody
[1:19:54] even before you see you have been you
[1:19:56] have been praying so how many here are

[1:20:15] asking you I I want to see do you know
[1:20:17] what I'm talking about because you see
[1:20:18] this thing it doesn't happen by mistake
[1:20:21] like fornication doesn't happen by
[1:20:22] mistake marriage doesn't also happen by
[1:20:24] mistake that e you have fallen in

[1:28:16] it is sweet it is nice and uh the whole
[1:28:20] time she was in me
[1:28:22] my
[1:28:27] mind when I saw I said but she is not
[1:28:30] exactly what I wanted God even her hair
[1:28:33] you have seen her hair now but if you
[1:28:35] see her hair
[1:28:37] then sincerely it was it was very
[1:28:40] horrible it's the truth even as she will
[1:28:42] tell you by by herself you
[1:28:45] know but when I was seeing it is not
[1:28:49] exactly what I what I wanted but but but
[1:28:53] God said is she's the one I wasn't sure
[1:28:56] even I had I had already told my pastor
[1:28:59] I was already talking with her but when
[1:29:00] I became unsure like this I told her I'm
[1:29:03] sorry let me first pray and be
[1:29:05] sure so I went I packed my bags I went I
[1:29:09] was I was desperate I prayed I said oh
[1:29:12] God prove to me oh God speak to me let
[1:29:14] me know your mind let me know your will
[1:29:17] but I had prayed before I found her but
[1:29:20] now that I was not sure even after
[1:29:22] finding I wanted to just be sure that it
[1:29:24] was the choice of God for me brother be
[1:29:26] sure that what God is saying don't marry
[1:29:28] someone when you are not sure you
[1:29:31] regret marry when you are sure and when
[1:29:34] I became sure God spoke to me in various
[1:29:36] ways I don't want to spend time on that
[1:29:37] but he spoke to me I came out very
[1:29:40] confident oh I had already broken her
[1:29:42] heart because I told her wait let me
[1:29:43] first confirm with God by the time I
[1:29:45] came back she was not on fire as she was
[1:29:47] on at first but SL by SL me I was
[1:29:50] sure
[1:29:56] so I I proposed to her and she looked on
[1:29:58] the roof she looked everywhere she
[1:30:00] looked on the right and the left but
[1:30:02] finally she had she could not run away
[1:30:04] from that word because she was meant for
[1:30:07] me and she accepted me and today I'm
[1:30:09] here very happy after 10 years I can't
[1:30:14] believe you 10 years brother Ian time
[1:30:15] runs like like nothing like wind and so
[1:30:18] you see friends your wife is in
[1:30:20] you
[1:30:27] God saw the end from the beginning and
[1:30:30] he knows what you want and he will lead
[1:30:31] you to the right one and when God leads
[1:30:34] you to the right one
[1:30:36] then it's time to come now to the pastor
[1:30:38] when you
[1:30:39] see of course you've seen
[1:30:46] them asking this and that sometimes it
[1:30:50] is not even very effective
[1:30:53] what is so effective is for God to
[1:30:55] confirm to you things and the testimony
[1:30:57] you hear from others I'll tell you that
[1:30:59] I'm telling you now real
[1:31:01] things and after you've make it is
[1:31:04] called due diligence do you know what
[1:31:05] due diligence is after you've made all
[1:31:08] your research and
[1:31:09] prayer after you've
[1:31:12] contacted you've done your due diligence
[1:31:15] then now you come to the pastor don't
[1:31:18] come to me when you are just is she the
[1:31:20] one is she not is she the one is she not
[1:31:23] it's not also good come to me only when
[1:31:26] you are 100% or at least 90%
[1:31:30] sure then when you come to me I will ask
[1:31:32] you are you sure she's the one if you
[1:31:35] say you are not I'll tell you okay go
[1:31:37] and confirm how are you going to confirm
[1:31:40] continue wrestling it in
[1:31:42] prayer and when you are sure that she's
[1:31:44] the one come back to me I'll tell you
[1:31:45] what next H now if I tell you like that
[1:31:48] and then you you go Pastor is just
[1:31:50] delaying me why must sister give me your
[1:31:53] contact you have already broken the
[1:31:55] whole thing you don't have the blessing
[1:31:56] of God you are on your own the moment
[1:31:58] you do that and God can't bless such a
[1:32:00] union I'm telling you I've seen it over
[1:32:02] and over and over and so um so you then
[1:32:07] courtship begins after your pastor is
[1:32:09] aware after the father of the girl is
[1:32:11] aware after if she's a most especially
[1:32:14] if they're Believers you know then you
[1:32:16] have approvals to court now I told you
[1:32:20] here before when I was preaching that
[1:32:21] believers do not
[1:32:24] de Believers
[1:32:26] CAU how many understand
[1:32:30] that H very few even the ones who
[1:32:33] understand it cannot understand it
[1:32:34] properly they putting their hand down
[1:32:38] like Believers what's the difference
[1:32:40] between cting and dating it's almost the
[1:32:42] same right but the difference here is
[1:32:44] dating is worldly
[1:32:47] whereby you you get a girl you see you
[1:32:50] say this is my girlfriend friend you you
[1:32:52] going everywhere together you are
[1:32:54] kissing you are hugging you are visiting
[1:32:57] each other you are sleeping together you
[1:32:59] are doing this and that do you
[1:33:00] understand what I'm talking about but we
[1:33:02] are only making sure that you don't
[1:33:04] become
[1:33:05] pregnant now that is dating and
[1:33:07] Believers don't date like that someone I
[1:33:10] saw a question here I'll answer it right
[1:33:12] here say that why is it that Believers
[1:33:14] in the West can do that and yet we
[1:33:16] cannot Believers in the west don't do
[1:33:18] that if you know anyone who do does it
[1:33:20] come and tell us no one do it among the
[1:33:22] Believers no one does it Believers
[1:33:24] caught and you CAU with the permission
[1:33:27] of the parents and especially your
[1:33:29] pastor should be aware and uh after that
[1:33:33] you know you've courted you've got to
[1:33:35] know one another you've agreed with one
[1:33:37] another agreements have been made
[1:33:38] decisions have made been made between
[1:33:40] the two then comes the
[1:33:43] next
[1:33:45] um
[1:33:47] Step then comes the engagement now
[1:33:50] engagement
[1:33:52] happens at the altar you've seen that
[1:33:54] happen before here engagement happens at
[1:33:56] the altar that's when you've now been
[1:33:58] sure the parents are sure you are sure
[1:34:00] the girl is sure the boy is sure the
[1:34:02] pastor is sure everybody is in unity
[1:34:05] together then now you do the engagement
[1:34:08] now what is the engagement who knows the
[1:34:20] engagement
[1:34:23] engagement in our culture
[1:34:26] but
[1:34:28] because usually we do it almost at the
[1:34:31] wedding time we aftera and you've known
[1:34:35] what you are going to uh the
[1:34:37] requirements of the parents and you have
[1:34:38] agreed with them to have your their
[1:34:40] daughter then you can give her an
[1:34:42] engagement ring as a sign you are mine
[1:34:44] and I'm Yours after the engagement you
[1:34:47] can't make up your mind to choose
[1:34:50] another
[1:34:52] you can't make up your mind to choose
[1:34:54] another it is done it is done then now
[1:34:57] you have to plan for your marriage
[1:34:58] ceremony and lastly you plan for your
[1:35:02] hmon but the problem usually is at the
[1:35:04] beginning there if you begin wrong I've
[1:35:05] seen many couples when you begin wrong
[1:35:08] you will always end wrong please I
[1:35:10] emphasize this when you begin wrong you
[1:35:13] will always end wrong and what is
[1:35:14] beginning wrong sorry my brother
[1:35:16] beginning wrong is the things that I've
[1:35:19] underlined and told you about beginning
[1:35:22] wrong is when you begin asking for
[1:35:24] contacts and I'm telling you here as
[1:35:25] your pastor if you take me to be a man
[1:35:27] of God we do not believe in exchanging
[1:35:31] numbers of people who are not married
[1:35:34] one with another and they begin talking
[1:35:36] without the knowledge of their pastors
[1:35:38] and their parents it is wrong it is
[1:35:41] wrong it is wrong and if you have
[1:35:44] understood it say
[1:35:45] Amen if a brother asks you your number
[1:35:48] sister and you give it you are also
[1:35:49] wrong and whatever ever happens don't
[1:35:53] say because I've heard rumors I'm
[1:35:55] telling you this on good authority I've
[1:35:57] heard rumors oh Brothers at
[1:36:01] dvf they they they they begin talking to
[1:36:04] sisters and then they withdraw they
[1:36:05] begin talking to sisters and then they
[1:36:07] disappoint them they begin talk they do
[1:36:09] this who has been guilty of that if you
[1:36:12] have been guilty of that you ought to
[1:36:14] repent you ought ask God to forgive you
[1:36:17] as a matter of fact when when when
[1:36:20] before before a a relationship reaches
[1:36:24] engagement before a relationship reaches
[1:36:27] engagement you you should it should even
[1:36:30] be secret it's a secret affair it should
[1:36:33] not even be known by many people really
[1:36:35] maybe the pastors and the parents and
[1:36:38] then your closest friend maybe you know
[1:36:41] not to be moved
[1:36:46] everywhere that thing is not right it
[1:36:48] shouldn't be done that way you know
[1:36:50] we've often seen people I was myself I
[1:36:53] was standing outside there and we've had
[1:36:56] many younger ladies visit this
[1:36:58] fellowship and then I was standing there
[1:37:01] I remember one day I never told anybody
[1:37:03] but it was like a dagger in my heart and
[1:37:06] then I saw young men running after this
[1:37:09] sister you know I don't know what they
[1:37:11] were telling the
[1:37:14] sister but I believe and I suspect they
[1:37:16] were saying sister sister sister sister
[1:37:20] sister
[1:37:21] to the extent that the girl will fear to
[1:37:23] come back
[1:37:30] again and when they leave like that they
[1:37:32] will go tell
[1:37:34] others it's a wrong spirit it's a wrong
[1:37:36] testimony it should never be heard Among
[1:37:39] Us never it's a wrong Spirit you should
[1:37:43] treat these sisters with dignity they
[1:37:45] daughters of God and you should also
[1:37:48] treat yourself honorable as a man of God
[1:37:51] friends if you want to marry the right
[1:37:54] place to go to is your
[1:37:56] pastor if you see someone go to your
[1:38:00] pastor now sisters let me talk to you a
[1:38:02] moment if someone comes and asks your
[1:38:05] number don't give
[1:38:07] it and if you've given some to some of
[1:38:10] those younger men you have a choice to
[1:38:14] make now are you going to continue in
[1:38:16] that relationship is it legal is it
[1:38:18] right is it holy is it accept
[1:38:22] what what are you trying to do what are
[1:38:23] you trying to talk about what are you
[1:38:24] building is it known or it is just
[1:38:27] something happening in the
[1:38:29] corridors if I were you I would begin
[1:38:32] again and say wait a moment what am I
[1:38:34] trying to do here and then if they say
[1:38:38] that the person NOS come and confirm or
[1:38:40] else there may be some of those wolves
[1:38:43] in ship's clothing lying to you to try
[1:38:46] and trap you don't be trapped don't
[1:38:48] accept anyone to trap you to their game
[1:38:51] be a real honorable person and God will
[1:38:53] bless you they are saying that it is
[1:38:55] difficult is to find a wife or a husband
[1:38:57] it is a lie of the devil it is easy as
[1:39:00] easy as it was 2,000 years ago because
[1:39:03] God is the same Jesus Christ is the same
[1:39:05] yesterday and forever if you follow the
[1:39:07] right principles as we teach them to you
[1:39:10] then it will not be difficult to you and
[1:39:12] if you want to confirm some of the
[1:39:14] things I've been saying please read the
[1:39:15] message the marriage of the lamb every
[1:39:17] one of you young people go and listen to
[1:39:19] it you have smartphones download it
[1:39:22] listen to all of it all of it brother
[1:39:24] bam says a very very good things in
[1:39:27] there the marriage of the Lamb
[1:39:29] 1962 praise the
[1:39:32] Lord now if you have any question out of
[1:39:34] what I said and you had not asked it
[1:39:36] feel free to ask and then I'll I'll now
[1:39:38] deal with these
[1:39:41] questions Pastor help me to understand
[1:39:43] what happens to sisters who give birth
[1:39:45] early will they two get Brothers on or
[1:39:50] it's
[1:39:51] difficult and let me ask a young men who
[1:39:54] are here how many would like to marry a
[1:39:56] sister that has children raise up your
[1:40:02] hand nobody rose up their hand so I'll
[1:40:05] tell you it is difficult so if you're
[1:40:08] planning to get a child it's difficult
[1:40:11] now if you already have one and you were
[1:40:13] not previously in any
[1:40:15] marriage that means you are not in any
[1:40:18] marriage it just happened and then you
[1:40:20] know you you got a child um but you not
[1:40:23] legally bound to any man for marriage it
[1:40:26] it is possible for you to marry it is
[1:40:29] legal scripturally legal for you to
[1:40:31] marry um a child is not necessarily a
[1:40:34] testimony of marriage it can happen when
[1:40:36] there is no confident of marriage I have
[1:40:39] also seen Grown sisters who
[1:40:43] are
[1:40:48] C I do not understand what she means by
[1:40:51] um I have seen Grown sisters who are is
[1:40:56] it corporate or trying to I don't know
[1:40:59] Finding difficulty to get
[1:41:02] married or maybe she meant I have also
[1:41:04] seen Grown sisters who are corporate
[1:41:07] finding difficulty to get married advise
[1:41:10] on this subject I I think when you mean
[1:41:12] sisters who are corporate you mean
[1:41:14] somebody who has a career someone who
[1:41:16] has a a good job or um I do not think it
[1:41:20] is difficult if you follow the due
[1:41:22] principles as we have presented them to
[1:41:23] you it's never difficult for both the
[1:41:25] sister and the brother I've given you
[1:41:28] many times an example of a brother
[1:41:30] morgas in Ethiopia who is now the pastor
[1:41:31] of the local church in Adis Ababa it
[1:41:33] wasn't difficult for him to find a wife
[1:41:36] um it was it's a long story but um when
[1:41:40] he saw this sister the sister was
[1:41:42] working in a a very big Bank earning a
[1:41:45] lot of money in dollars H she had
[1:41:48] property she was quite doing well
[1:41:51] financially speaking and she was
[1:41:52] corporate like you just asked the
[1:41:54] question and uh when this young man who
[1:41:57] was just newly from college uh came and
[1:42:00] you know saw how he he had always given
[1:42:04] a a testament or a testimony that U my
[1:42:07] wife is somewhere she's worshiping God
[1:42:09] one day I'll turn my eyes and I will see
[1:42:11] her you remember that testimony so she
[1:42:13] turned her he turned his eyes one day in
[1:42:15] the church and he saw her and he came to
[1:42:18] me he said she's my wife I said are you
[1:42:21] sure he said yes I'm sure I said are you
[1:42:24] really sure I said I gave him some of
[1:42:25] you have given you that booklet of 100
[1:42:28] pages I told him on courtship and
[1:42:29] marriage I said go read it when you have
[1:42:31] finished reading it come back to me if
[1:42:33] you're still sure he said I'm still sure
[1:42:35] after a few maybe two weeks I said well
[1:42:38] then pray a little more they contacting
[1:42:40] a sister I made it very difficult for
[1:42:42] him because I knew the sister he is
[1:42:44] trying to contact is
[1:42:46] Corporate and if you is not really sure
[1:42:50] and the say refuses it will demoralize
[1:42:52] him and he was my associate I did not
[1:42:54] want a demoralized associate I needed
[1:42:57] someone who is going to be St so I
[1:42:59] didn't want to allow him to go you see
[1:43:01] pastors have many different reasons so
[1:43:03] when he he guides you don't I'll just do
[1:43:06] the way please it means you have a
[1:43:07] problem of listening and
[1:43:09] submitting submit to
[1:43:11] leadership and so he did and he did not
[1:43:14] contact her until you know he kept on
[1:43:16] coming he said pastor I'm now sure I
[1:43:18] prayed and I'm sure I said well then if
[1:43:22] you sure my wife I think gave him the
[1:43:24] contact and uh then uh you know started
[1:43:27] talking to the sister and uh the sister
[1:43:29] God had already spoken to her the time
[1:43:31] when he was praying the time when he was
[1:43:34] praying God spoke to the
[1:43:36] sister but God had already spoken to the
[1:43:39] sister and God had already showed the
[1:43:41] brother what type of woman he will marry
[1:43:42] and God had already showed the sister
[1:43:44] before they even came in contact so you
[1:43:46] can see this whole thing is done by God
[1:43:47] Brethren matchmaking is done by God it's
[1:43:50] not about how much money you have or how
[1:43:51] little you have God can give you anybody
[1:43:53] the brother had nothing the sister had
[1:43:55] everything but guess what I I fed to
[1:43:58] nirobi met the pastor and we talked over
[1:44:00] read the pastor welcomed us and then we
[1:44:02] were able to um you know uh uh you know
[1:44:06] also speak to the family and and the and
[1:44:08] the girl when she came down to um
[1:44:12] Ethiopia before we even knew she was
[1:44:15] going to marry the brother my wife and I
[1:44:17] told her we claim you here she said
[1:44:19] amen h
[1:44:21] nothing happens by accident brother
[1:44:23] sister we claimed that in Ethiopia and
[1:44:25] God did it through marriage and a
[1:44:28] brother married her well long story
[1:44:29] short they got married in Nairobi it was
[1:44:31] a powerful wedding powerful wedding and
[1:44:35] um and uh how even God did it all to
[1:44:39] leave her job and to go everything was a
[1:44:41] testimony it's a long story I don't want
[1:44:43] to waste time on that maybe one time
[1:44:45] they will give they will come and give
[1:44:46] their own testimony uh it will encourage
[1:44:49] many young people so yes it is possible
[1:44:51] for someone who cooporate to marry uh
[1:44:54] very very well if they followed the
[1:44:55] right principles of the word the whole
[1:44:57] time the sister was single but waiting
[1:45:00] upon God she had the money to get a
[1:45:03] younger brother and you know convince
[1:45:04] him with money and support and stuff
[1:45:06] like that and make him close so that
[1:45:10] eventually the young man can pick
[1:45:11] interest but she did not you see so
[1:45:14] because when a sisters corporate there
[1:45:15] is also that temptation but you need to
[1:45:18] know your place that
[1:45:29] God bless you uh the saints of God I'm
[1:45:33] asking now I'm asking now women are not
[1:45:37] allowed to preach on the pulpit am I
[1:45:39] allowed to preach at the roadside or
[1:45:42] door to door or to a group of people
[1:45:44] sitting down together you are not
[1:45:47] allowed to preach on the pulpit it's
[1:45:50] it's not about the pulpit it's about the
[1:45:52] principle of preaching whereby there are
[1:45:55] two things as long as you do not go
[1:45:57] against them it's okay number one you're
[1:46:00] not allowed to rule over men rule over
[1:46:03] men number two you're not allowed to
[1:46:06] teach men all right teach men instruct
[1:46:08] them meaning instruct them so if you're
[1:46:12] preaching or you're sharing your
[1:46:13] testimony is not including that then I
[1:46:16] think that should be
[1:46:18] fine and I don't see you preaching on
[1:46:20] the rad side and not ruling over whoever
[1:46:24] you are preaching to I I I don't think
[1:46:26] that preaching is really for men for
[1:46:28] women but I believe that you can exhort
[1:46:31] uh people even men you can lead them to
[1:46:34] the Lord we have many testimonies in the
[1:46:36] Bible of women that led many men to the
[1:46:38] Lord and so it is possible without
[1:46:40] necessarily teaching them maybe giving
[1:46:42] them a track and telling them about what
[1:46:44] you believe like giving a testimony and
[1:46:46] bringing them to church that's the best
[1:46:47] way a sister can preach and another way
[1:46:50] living a life that is worthy of your
[1:46:53] testimony all right uh another question
[1:46:56] God bless
[1:46:57] you there is this guy who has admired my
[1:47:03] ways as a
[1:47:05] sister I don't know if this guy is a
[1:47:07] Believer because Believers he should
[1:47:10] have said a brother I don't
[1:47:12] know but he said a guy there is this guy
[1:47:16] who has admired my ways as a sister
[1:47:19] because at my uh because of my Christian
[1:47:22] ways and and he said I can only say yes
[1:47:26] to him if he comes to
[1:47:29] church because he is more than willing
[1:47:34] to come to
[1:47:36] church I am afraid he might come get
[1:47:42] saved and later propose to me is it even
[1:47:46] appropriate should I just chase him away
[1:47:50] because because I don't want to do
[1:47:52] PCM very good question now you're mixing
[1:47:56] up two things sister I think this is a
[1:47:57] sister you're mixing up two things
[1:47:58] number one you are mixing up salvation
[1:48:02] of a
[1:48:03] soul and marriage that one should never
[1:48:07] be found in one statement or one
[1:48:08] sentence it is the biggest mistake you
[1:48:11] can ever
[1:48:12] do I want to believe that this guy as
[1:48:15] you said has talked to you and talked
[1:48:19] about marriage with you which was the a
[1:48:21] mistake to begin with because from what
[1:48:24] you are saying it appears you have
[1:48:25] already told her for us I can't marry
[1:48:29] you unless you believe what I believe
[1:48:31] and now when you do that he will say
[1:48:33] it's all right I I'll will come to your
[1:48:34] church I I will accept you already know
[1:48:38] these things but you're asking as if you
[1:48:39] do not know so now if you make that deal
[1:48:43] it's a deal you have planned your
[1:48:45] marriage and your marriage has not come
[1:48:47] from God and you you are more likely to
[1:48:49] find issu ues but here is what I would
[1:48:52] do if I was you I would encourage that
[1:48:54] man or that guy as you said to come to
[1:48:58] church and leave him in the hands of the
[1:49:02] ministers you would have done your part
[1:49:04] forget about him you have no
[1:49:06] relationship with him don't accept him
[1:49:08] to get into your private inbox that
[1:49:11] means WhatsApp and stuff calls that's
[1:49:14] completely out consider him a soul that
[1:49:16] you have won to the Lord if indeed he
[1:49:19] comes and he scks in the church
[1:49:22] but if he's a seed of God he will indeed
[1:49:25] believe and he can truly be changed and
[1:49:28] your and your pastor if you come to
[1:49:30] church here I'll give you an opinion of
[1:49:31] him after a little while indeed we are
[1:49:34] able to know that but um if he not and
[1:49:39] intending to catch you and then snatch
[1:49:42] you away or leave the Lord we can also
[1:49:45] find out if he's meant for you he will
[1:49:47] be for you no need to worry right now
[1:49:49] what you should should be worried about
[1:49:51] is winning a soul to the Lord don't even
[1:49:53] think about marriage because you can't
[1:49:54] think about marriage with an
[1:49:56] nonbeliever have I answered that
[1:49:59] appropriately it is possible for you to
[1:50:02] lead someone to the Lord who will be
[1:50:03] your husband or wife by the way it is
[1:50:05] not that we are saying it is impossible
[1:50:06] it is very much possible but that person
[1:50:08] has to be genuine you see who knows that
[1:50:11] they are genuine ah don't tell me that
[1:50:14] spiritual men cannot design between a
[1:50:16] sheep and a God we can be able to see
[1:50:18] that and that's why a pastor is placed
[1:50:20] there for such things like that another
[1:50:22] question how do you know your future
[1:50:24] partner I've already answered that have
[1:50:25] I not have I not church if I haven't
[1:50:29] said no then I will answer it have I
[1:50:32] not if I have say Amen all right did
[1:50:37] someone said
[1:50:38] no I think I've answered that it's what
[1:50:41] we spent more of the time on God bless
[1:50:44] you Pastor is it right for a youth to
[1:50:48] have a girl
[1:50:53] uh this one is be the way he's asking he
[1:50:57] doesn't want me to know whether is a boy
[1:50:58] or a
[1:50:59] girl but uh by the handwriting I can
[1:51:03] think he's a
[1:51:05] boy is it right for a youth to have a
[1:51:07] girl or
[1:51:09] boyfriend I think I've also answered
[1:51:11] this but I will emphasize on this when
[1:51:13] you say a girlfriend or boyfriend in the
[1:51:16] world that means someone you can do
[1:51:19] private things together is that
[1:51:21] correct yes what are the private things
[1:51:24] hugging and kissing and spending time
[1:51:27] together right private time together
[1:51:29] that is almost like someone who is in
[1:51:30] your courtship or in courtship with you
[1:51:33] so that is out of bounds for believers
[1:51:35] we do not do such things that's dating
[1:51:38] and Believers don't date so I don't
[1:51:39] expect you to have a girlfriend he's my
[1:51:41] girlfriend he my boyfriend no no no no
[1:51:43] we don't do that if you do
[1:51:48] yes
[1:51:53] everybody has friends that are not the
[1:51:54] same gender even
[1:51:57] myself that you see that shouldn't even
[1:52:01] be a question it is human to have
[1:52:02] friends not of the same gender is it not
[1:52:05] human that's why I don't believe in
[1:52:06] these things
[1:52:08] of of single
[1:52:11] schools I think it's not
[1:52:14] good because it
[1:52:18] makes
[1:52:20] boys not express themselves properly and
[1:52:23] girls not express themselves properly I
[1:52:24] think it's good for them to go in a
[1:52:26] mixed school um but um whereby it
[1:52:31] becomes a question it means it is
[1:52:33] meaning something else you get the point
[1:52:36] so because if he a friend who is a girl
[1:52:39] I think limitation you know you must
[1:52:43] have something that connects you with
[1:52:44] anybody that you are friends with not so
[1:52:47] whether it's a boy or a girl you must
[1:52:49] have a connection so the question is
[1:52:50] what is your connection books ah no
[1:52:53] problem if it is a books it is no
[1:52:58] problem for example I'll give you an
[1:53:00] example here sham stand up stand up
[1:53:03] favor stand
[1:53:05] up here are two young people that go to
[1:53:09] the same school favor was ministered to
[1:53:11] by sham I've never heard that do you
[1:53:14] have a relationship going on are you
[1:53:16] planning to get
[1:53:18] married you get point I don't know of
[1:53:21] any relationship going on between them
[1:53:24] it is purely books and even when I go to
[1:53:26] school I will find them is studying
[1:53:29] together at school in public no Private
[1:53:33] Affairs you get a point others do it at
[1:53:35] school hey wait a moment I may be
[1:53:38] telling lies
[1:53:40] sister are you at the same school what I
[1:53:43] said is it true or there is something
[1:53:44] else there's
[1:53:47] nothing H go God has done
[1:53:53] some you get the point so it is possible
[1:53:56] to have a friend when there is no
[1:53:57] alterior motives but if you decide later
[1:54:00] on to marry your friend who is a
[1:54:02] Believer what is wrong with that but now
[1:54:04] when you make a friend who is not a
[1:54:05] Believer then there's a
[1:54:07] problem there a problem to have a friend
[1:54:09] who is not a Believer because what if
[1:54:10] you like them and then eventually you
[1:54:12] want to marry
[1:54:14] them I used to have a friend oh that
[1:54:17] girl was called Jen she was were we were
[1:54:21] having is there a journey
[1:54:24] here we were having normal friendship
[1:54:27] nothing attached but eventually I
[1:54:29] developed feelings and I thought I would
[1:54:30] marry her and I had already believed now
[1:54:32] about one or two years so I told my
[1:54:34] pastor is it possible to Mar an
[1:54:35] unbeliever he said no I felt so bad
[1:54:38] because we had received an attachment so
[1:54:40] you see you should be careful about
[1:54:42] those
[1:54:42] thingsa you a human being and you have
[1:54:44] feelings
[1:54:46] right okay um don't worry my wife knows
[1:54:50] about Jane she will not crucify
[1:54:57] me that is why it is good to tell them
[1:55:00] these things before you get married
[1:55:01] because after after they hear it you if
[1:55:03] she was hearing it for the first time I
[1:55:05] would have had a tough time at home
[1:55:09] today all right another question here is
[1:55:12] it right for a Believer girl and boy to
[1:55:16] be so close to one another no it is not
[1:55:20] under no circumstance should you be so
[1:55:23] close because so close means
[1:55:26] danger you cannot put
[1:55:29] fire and and and what is this butter
[1:55:33] together my dear you will cause problems
[1:55:36] butter and fire can coexist but not so
[1:55:40] close uhhuh another question since gifts
[1:55:42] like seeing visions prophesying are
[1:55:45] without repentance should we call um
[1:55:48] like some of the nonb leave us with
[1:55:50] these gifts to prophesy and see Visions
[1:55:52] for us for us I am the one who added
[1:55:54] that but I think she meant for us no I I
[1:55:57] believe like you said gifts and callings
[1:55:59] are without repentance a man can have a
[1:56:02] gift but he himself go to hell did you
[1:56:04] know that but also the Bible says that
[1:56:07] uh when the blind the blind lead the
[1:56:10] blind both of them fall into the ditch
[1:56:12] if I were you I would desire to have a
[1:56:14] real born again man of God to minister
[1:56:17] to me and if he had no gift at all I
[1:56:20] would just still trust in the word of
[1:56:22] inspiration that God will give him for
[1:56:24] my life I would not rely and direct and
[1:56:26] Lead my life on the basis of gifts and
[1:56:29] Visions because many times those things
[1:56:32] could be of God but also could be from
[1:56:34] the devil and another thing is these
[1:56:36] people when they are not born again it
[1:56:37] means they have no fear of God they can
[1:56:39] add anything I've seen people who are
[1:56:40] even drunkards but with these
[1:56:43] gifts yes it is true
[1:56:48] possible
[1:56:51] so don't trust those things because it
[1:56:53] can be wrong and sometimes it can be
[1:56:56] right and sometimes it could be right
[1:56:58] and then they add other things on top of
[1:56:59] it so you want to trust a real uh
[1:57:02] Ministry that will mature your life not
[1:57:06] gifts you want to trust gifts that are
[1:57:08] coming in the right channel of God uh
[1:57:11] are there no gifts in the house of God
[1:57:14] that's why we should desire for the
[1:57:16] things of God if there are gifts among
[1:57:18] us then uh
[1:57:20] uh God can speak through us and I
[1:57:22] believe in this church we have gifts we
[1:57:25] have people who see Visions we have
[1:57:26] people who dream dreams we have people
[1:57:28] who tell prophecies we have people who
[1:57:29] speak tongues we have people who
[1:57:30] interpret tongues so we are not La in
[1:57:33] lack of gifts and I don't see the
[1:57:35] relevance of this question and if you
[1:57:38] feel that um there are these people who
[1:57:41] go around selling gifts I saw them in
[1:57:43] Ethiopia you know a they pray with you
[1:57:46] they prophesy prophesy prophesy prophesy
[1:57:49] and then and then
[1:57:50] they some something and then you'll give
[1:57:53] them are they here in
[1:57:55] Uganda e you prophesy prophesy prophesy
[1:57:58] speak to you and the things will always
[1:58:00] be positive by the way and then after
[1:58:03] you'll give money it is a they call it
[1:58:06] what of prophet whatever but those
[1:58:08] things we should not be found in such um
[1:58:12] in such traps because it can easily
[1:58:14] mislead
[1:58:16] you all right why do I feel that God
[1:58:19] does doesn't answer my
[1:58:21] prayers uh you feel that God is not
[1:58:23] answering your prayers you should you
[1:58:25] might have a reason why you feel that
[1:58:27] way maybe because your prayers are not
[1:58:28] coming to pass I'll direct you to the
[1:58:31] scripture which says that um your
[1:58:34] prayers are not answered because maybe
[1:58:36] you pray a
[1:58:38] Miss how do you pray a miss you do not
[1:58:41] pray according to the will of God it's
[1:58:43] just like a married man praying God may
[1:58:45] you give me a
[1:58:47] wife God will not answer that prayer
[1:58:49] prayer but because you're praying am
[1:58:51] Miss but also you may pray wrongly you
[1:58:53] may not pray correctly what is praying
[1:58:55] correctly you must pray according to the
[1:58:56] heart of God according to the desire and
[1:58:58] the will of God and the will of God is
[1:59:00] found in the word of God the word is the
[1:59:02] basis for prayer if you do not know the
[1:59:04] word you cannot pray according to the
[1:59:05] will of God but if you know the will of
[1:59:07] God you know the word of God then you're
[1:59:08] going to pray according to the
[1:59:10] inspiration that you have received from
[1:59:11] the word of God and God will always
[1:59:13] answer such prayers I have the example
[1:59:16] of Daniel when Daniel read the book of
[1:59:18] the prophet and he found
[1:59:19] the will of God for Israel then he went
[1:59:21] to prayer and when he went to prayer God
[1:59:23] came by an Angel and spoke to him and
[1:59:25] guided him how he should pray so God
[1:59:27] should guide you how to pray and your
[1:59:28] prayers will always be answered okay can
[1:59:32] one have the Holy Ghost and be not sure
[1:59:34] no if you have the Holy Spirit you will
[1:59:37] be sure if you're not sure it's a clear
[1:59:39] sign either you are not well Tau or you
[1:59:41] do not have the Holy Spirit
[1:59:44] because another way of answering this
[1:59:46] question is uh how many he have ever had
[1:59:49] a
[1:59:51] child get the microphone pass it to
[1:59:53] Sister MAA I want to ask a
[1:59:55] question uh make sure it is
[2:00:00] on uh sister MAA how many children do
[2:00:03] you have Pastor I have four children
[2:00:06] four children
[2:00:08] um is it possible for you to have them
[2:00:10] and not no no it's not possible uh what
[2:00:14] about you know that you have them that
[2:00:16] they are yours but how sure uh uh is it
[2:00:18] possible for you that you delivered them
[2:00:20] by yourself and they were not given to
[2:00:22] you by adoption but you delivered them
[2:00:24] and then you forgot that you delivered
[2:00:25] is it possible it's not possible why
[2:00:27] because I know them and I was giving
[2:00:29] birth to them and they have grown in my
[2:00:31] hands and the labor word were you in the
[2:00:34] labor word yes I was in the lab of you
[2:00:36] remember how each child treated you yes
[2:00:38] sir you had an experience with each
[2:00:40] child yes God bless you so you see when
[2:00:44] you are having the Holy Ghost it's like
[2:00:46] child birth it's New Birth it's like
[2:00:48] child bir you will remember when you
[2:00:51] received him you remember how you
[2:00:53] remember what experience you had and you
[2:00:55] remember what happened to you afterwards
[2:00:57] so you see it is an experience I've Tau
[2:00:59] on this before but I can take it further
[2:01:02] in other teachings in the church if you
[2:01:04] you you will whoever ask this question
[2:01:07] if you're not satisfied come to me and
[2:01:08] then I can be able to guide you further
[2:01:10] okay another question
[2:01:11] here can someone okay on this question
[2:01:14] some people say brother bam say that you
[2:01:17] receive the Holy Spirit without
[2:01:18] sensation how many have read that
[2:01:20] quote uhuh so now it means that when the
[2:01:23] Holy Spirit comes he comes in quietly
[2:01:26] and you will never
[2:01:27] know I'll tell you this the holy spirit
[2:01:30] is not emotion but the holy spirit is
[2:01:34] emotional do you understand
[2:01:37] that okay a child is not
[2:01:41] emotion but a child will never be
[2:01:44] deceived without
[2:01:46] emotion when a child during child birth
[2:01:49] and
[2:01:50] labor there will be all sorts of things
[2:01:52] it will be a mess blood everywhere water
[2:01:56] this and that and some other stuff I
[2:01:57] don't want to talk about it will be a
[2:01:59] mess sometimes but then out of that
[2:02:02] comes the child himself you see some
[2:02:06] some people can even have all that mess
[2:02:07] and still they they deliver a stillborn
[2:02:10] child and the child will be dead they
[2:02:12] will come out with all the mess but
[2:02:14] without a child so it's a blessing when
[2:02:17] you go there you got the mess you get
[2:02:19] the mess and then you get your child but
[2:02:21] now people who are teaching us that we
[2:02:24] should not have a mess that one is not
[2:02:26] even in the script why because as much
[2:02:30] as whether your child is dead or
[2:02:33] not the mess will be there if indeed you
[2:02:35] were pregnant now when you receive the
[2:02:38] word of God it will impregnant your soul
[2:02:41] impregnant your soul you will stay under
[2:02:43] the altar revelation after Revelation
[2:02:45] striking your heart what what will
[2:02:47] happen after you will receive receive an
[2:02:50] experience there will be a mess sometime
[2:02:53] you know we've seen it here sometimes
[2:02:54] people you know shouting and falling
[2:02:56] down and you know having all sorts of
[2:02:58] tears and shouting and everything which
[2:03:00] they did not plan to do which they were
[2:03:02] not faking it was real now does it mean
[2:03:05] they have received the Holy Spirit
[2:03:06] sometimes yes sometimes no because it
[2:03:08] may be a mess but when they've just been
[2:03:10] anointed on their Spirit you know when
[2:03:12] you're not anointed on your spirit you
[2:03:13] can even speak in tongues and rejoice
[2:03:15] and Shout but how do we know you have
[2:03:17] received this Holy Spirit the life
[2:03:20] afterwards the fruit area if the that
[2:03:23] area of the fruit is missing then that
[2:03:25] means you don't have the Holy Spirit but
[2:03:27] when the fruit to those of you who want
[2:03:29] to know the fruit area put for them the
[2:03:30] scripture in the book of Galatians the
[2:03:32] fruit of the spirits
[2:03:34] are Joy love peace other things so when
[2:03:39] you see those things in your life after
[2:03:41] the experience not before after the
[2:03:43] experience then you will know indeed you
[2:03:46] have the Holy Spirit things that you did
[2:03:47] not used to do you now do them things
[2:03:49] you used not you used to do you no
[2:03:52] longer do them is the life of Jesus
[2:03:54] Christ in you but you cannot receive it
[2:03:56] quietly it comes in with emotion but
[2:03:59] itself it is quiet it is God who comes
[2:04:02] on your heart he comes in slowly and he
[2:04:05] comes
[2:04:06] in without a f he's gentle butam said
[2:04:10] the holy spirit is a gentleman you see
[2:04:12] he comes in so slowly just like that
[2:04:14] child when that child is born after all
[2:04:17] the hustle and the mess
[2:04:19] then he's born silently but then
[2:04:21] afterwards what happens what
[2:04:24] happens crying comes out if the child
[2:04:27] doesn't cry that child is still born is
[2:04:30] dead and there are many believers who
[2:04:32] are still born no experience at all not
[2:04:35] crying at
[2:04:41] all I don't like such a church I'm so
[2:04:44] thankful that our church is not so cold
[2:04:46] like that we must be on fire where you
[2:04:48] are here hearing hallelujah amen
[2:04:50] shouting here clapping hands here
[2:04:51] jumping here running around here no
[2:04:53] problem we want those things but some
[2:04:55] Churches when people do like that you
[2:04:57] will be what's
[2:04:59] happening when you hear some someone say
[2:05:01] hallelujah what is happening you see
[2:05:04] because you are not used to that
[2:05:05] Dynamics but you see when if you want to
[2:05:08] see there is life in the church there
[2:05:09] will be those Dynamics it will be in the
[2:05:11] church to show you that there is life
[2:05:13] the child will cry out and if they
[2:05:15] doesn't if he doesn't cries out
[2:05:17] sometimes they have to beat him a bit
[2:05:19] so that's why brother bam says that the
[2:05:21] church sometimes needs a gospel
[2:05:24] spanking you spun them with the gospel
[2:05:26] and it bring that cry out
[2:05:29] Hallelujah all right I think I've
[2:05:31] answered that one now can someone who
[2:05:33] has backer SLE be baptized again like
[2:05:37] someone who has been doing ungodly
[2:05:39] things like having boyfriends boy lovers
[2:05:42] like at school dancing
[2:05:44] daners ah this one is very tough
[2:05:50] ah what can that person do in order for
[2:05:53] him to for him or her live a perfect
[2:05:56] Godly life very good question I take
[2:05:59] this question with all seriousness and I
[2:06:02] understand that it means much to you but
[2:06:03] um to begin with uh I've talked about
[2:06:07] the matter of boyfriends I've talked
[2:06:08] about boy lovers now this matter of boy
[2:06:11] lovers and boyfriends I don't know if
[2:06:13] there is a
[2:06:13] difference but I hope you mean that the
[2:06:16] boyfriends and the boy lovers both fall
[2:06:19] in the same category otherwise you would
[2:06:20] not have mentioned boyfriends but now
[2:06:22] you are trying to say that you have
[2:06:24] boyfriends after that then you have boy
[2:06:26] lovers so you have them in phases and
[2:06:29] then you you go at danz danz I think you
[2:06:32] mean uh you mean dances at school in in
[2:06:36] Disco by the way those discos they
[2:06:38] arrange at school Believers should not
[2:06:39] be a part of them they used to make them
[2:06:42] but I never attended them one time I
[2:06:44] went to one and when I went and I
[2:06:46] arrived there like this I was going to
[2:06:49] enter and something came and hit
[2:06:53] me it was the Sten of all the people who
[2:06:56] are dancing I felt like vomiting I ran
[2:06:59] out I never went even close when they
[2:07:02] dancing I go very far in the dmetry
[2:07:05] there so let me tell you I don't know
[2:07:06] people who go to those dances how they
[2:07:08] are able to bear that Sten I really
[2:07:10] don't
[2:07:11] know I don't know I don't know you do
[2:07:15] you
[2:07:16] know so younger people don't go to those
[2:07:19] kind of
[2:07:20] dances it has wrong spirits that it puts
[2:07:22] in your spirit and then you you you you
[2:07:25] you begin to become starchy to the word
[2:07:26] of God and you know you you begin to
[2:07:29] feel cold and you no longer desire the
[2:07:31] things of God you know because
[2:07:34] it so you don't want to be close to
[2:07:36] those kind of things um so the question
[2:07:39] is do you need to be baptized again you
[2:07:43] don't you don't need to be baptized
[2:07:44] again if you are baptized already in the
[2:07:46] name of our Lord Jesus Christ because
[2:07:47] once Jesus G gives you salvation he
[2:07:49] gives it to you once and for all he
[2:07:51] doesn't take it away and if you receive
[2:07:54] the spirit of God still he doesn't take
[2:07:56] him him away but what happens is the joy
[2:07:59] of your salvation will go David uh uh
[2:08:03] speaks of that in the book of uh Psalms
[2:08:05] chapter 51 he
[2:08:07] says when he had sinned he had gone with
[2:08:10] a woman who was not has and killed a
[2:08:12] husband and uh he had committed murder
[2:08:14] and adultery and he wanted God to
[2:08:16] forgive him he prayed like this he said
[2:08:20] uh he said U create in me a clean heart
[2:08:23] oh
[2:08:24] God and renew a right Spirit within me
[2:08:28] and he says take not away your Holy
[2:08:30] Spirit from me meaning he still had the
[2:08:33] Holy Spirit when the Holy Spirit comes
[2:08:35] just like salvation he abides he doesn't
[2:08:37] ever go but the joy of Salvation will go
[2:08:41] so you need to restore that relationship
[2:08:43] with Jesus Christ in prayer in
[2:08:45] consecration in fasting and God will
[2:08:47] give it back to you all
[2:08:50] right uh we are advancing we advancing
[2:08:53] don't you worry are we
[2:08:55] tired okay we can push on can a Believer
[2:08:58] wear clothes having labels like de is
[2:09:02] that what is this did I pronounce that
[2:09:05] properly di Drew and many others di is
[2:09:11] it called
[2:09:12] di
[2:09:14] di
[2:09:16] Dior ah pronounce is pronunciations are
[2:09:20] different uh Drew let me ask you what
[2:09:22] does Dio
[2:09:24] mean
[2:09:27] huh
[2:09:29] H what does do mean
[2:09:34] yes it means that devil is our ruler
[2:09:37] devil is our
[2:09:39] [Music]
[2:09:42] ruler
[2:09:47] yes
[2:09:53] yeah I I agree with you but every brand
[2:09:55] has a meaning for
[2:09:58] example for example Toyota is a brand it
[2:10:01] is someone whose
[2:10:02] name that's behind Toyota we know is a
[2:10:05] person and that's why they call it
[2:10:07] Toyota and there are other brands that
[2:10:10] uh also having a meaning behind it
[2:10:15] either openly or secretly so now Dio is
[2:10:19] it someone's name or does it mean
[2:10:21] exactly what the sister said and is
[2:10:24] secret so most people concer here that
[2:10:27] it means devil is our Ruler all right
[2:10:30] and then uh Drew means
[2:10:33] what
[2:10:35] huh devil rules
[2:10:45] everywhere the young people are killing
[2:10:47] me today
[2:10:48] what what what are you saying
[2:11:06] brother it's their
[2:11:12] brands that
[2:11:14] is
[2:11:17] BAS such it means
[2:11:20] what
[2:11:24] huh I can't even understand those things
[2:11:28] uh here is what I want to say on this
[2:11:31] matter uh and pro probably someone who
[2:11:33] has asked this question it's a question
[2:11:35] in their minds maybe because of what we
[2:11:38] have heard here it is it may be true or
[2:11:41] it may be false that they have a bad
[2:11:44] meaning like we're hearing people may
[2:11:47] come up with the this words and they may
[2:11:49] be actually right or they may be wrong
[2:11:53] but the fact
[2:11:54] is uh the Bible says stay away or Shine
[2:12:00] from every appearance of evil it may not
[2:12:03] be evil but if it appears as evil stay
[2:12:05] away from it don't be anywhere close to
[2:12:07] it stay away from it um if it's a brand
[2:12:10] and and also receive the Holy Spirit if
[2:12:12] you have the Holy
[2:12:13] Spirit you know you see these people
[2:12:16] they now making everything for example
[2:12:19] even socks the other day I was you know
[2:12:22] somewhere and I I saw a man wearing a
[2:12:25] socks with a rainbow and someone told me
[2:12:29] um uh that you see that socks means that
[2:12:32] that that person is a homosexual I said
[2:12:34] what how do you know that I was about to
[2:12:37] tell you it's beautiful I would want to
[2:12:38] buy it so in other words you see but uh
[2:12:43] people know a lot of things that are
[2:12:45] secret or they are open or they are not
[2:12:47] known but when when you have the Holy
[2:12:49] Spirit he will lead you he will guide
[2:12:51] you to all truth and and in some of
[2:12:54] these things you may want to buy a dress
[2:12:56] but something in you tells you m leave
[2:12:58] that one or a shirt or a T-shirt and you
[2:13:00] just leave it you don't know even why
[2:13:02] always follow that leading of the spirit
[2:13:04] of God and if something has a question
[2:13:06] about it stay away from stay far from it
[2:13:10] okay what can a Believer do in order for
[2:13:12] him or her to live a Pure Life without
[2:13:15] listening to secular music though he or
[2:13:18] she is leaving where people listen to
[2:13:25] it the Bible says we are in the world
[2:13:28] but we are not of the world if you in a
[2:13:31] place maybe your neighbors are playing
[2:13:33] worldly music and uh you have power to
[2:13:36] tell them to reduce or stop you can do
[2:13:38] that but if I were you you a younger
[2:13:41] person I am sure if you don't want it
[2:13:43] you know how to for example you can get
[2:13:45] earphones that will blind or block your
[2:13:47] ears from hearing what others are
[2:13:48] hearing and you will hear something else
[2:13:50] is that not true you can devise means of
[2:13:53] keeping yourself s spiritually s in an
[2:13:56] insane situation I believe that that is
[2:13:59] what you would do otherwise you don't
[2:14:01] want to
[2:14:08] say don't do that you see and then you
[2:14:11] begin also dancing when I go to I will
[2:14:13] repent after all everybody is now you
[2:14:15] know my family what am I going to to to
[2:14:18] distance myself from my family let us
[2:14:20] dance and then when I go at church I
[2:14:21] will
[2:14:23] repent that is
[2:14:25] hypocrisy try to live your Christian
[2:14:28] life no matter where you are in
[2:14:29] whichever
[2:14:30] situation what can what can of friends
[2:14:34] can a Believer I think beli what kind of
[2:14:38] friends can a Believer have I think
[2:14:39] that's the
[2:14:40] question can someone answer this
[2:14:43] question what kind of believer can I
[2:14:46] what kind of friends can a believer have
[2:14:49] any young person there's a reason why I
[2:14:51] wanted to be answered this way who has
[2:14:53] an answer to this one raise up your hand
[2:14:55] so I can give you the microphone yes
[2:14:57] give it to the sister over there what
[2:15:00] kind of friends can I believe I
[2:15:11] have productive friends who who wait
[2:15:15] wait explain more who are productive
[2:15:16] friends
[2:15:18] both spiritually and physically God
[2:15:21] bless you friends that are helping you
[2:15:24] to progress in both spiritual things and
[2:15:28] physical life now you are going to have
[2:15:29] a friend who is going to tell you to try
[2:15:32] cigarettes or you going to have a friend
[2:15:34] who will tell you to do something that
[2:15:37] is against the word of God and you are
[2:15:39] saying after all is my friend some
[2:15:41] friends you have to disassociate
[2:15:42] yourself from them to cut that
[2:15:44] friendship to to to remove yourself from
[2:15:46] them or else when some certain things
[2:15:49] happen you don't say God will understand
[2:15:52] when you are the one who has caused them
[2:15:53] so make yourself friends of people who
[2:15:57] are going to add value on your life can
[2:15:59] you say Amen to that amen friends that
[2:16:01] will add value I think I was reading a
[2:16:03] quote here not long ago and brother bham
[2:16:06] said that um uh how many remember that
[2:16:08] uh he said something on the line of um I
[2:16:12] think associate yourself with people who
[2:16:15] believe who are believing like you are
[2:16:18] believing for example if you're
[2:16:19] believing to be a rich man don't
[2:16:23] associate yourself with poor
[2:16:25] people you will be poor I'm telling you
[2:16:28] because poor people talk poor things
[2:16:31] every time they are crying on how poor
[2:16:33] they are how bad the situation is how
[2:16:35] bad you know this happen so you will
[2:16:36] find yourself in the same talk that's
[2:16:39] why me when people talk like that I
[2:16:42] either keep quiet or move away because I
[2:16:43] don't want to be
[2:16:46] defiled you understand
[2:16:48] when people begin to talk about things
[2:16:50] that lift up Satan you know you see some
[2:16:53] people make the gospel hard they do this
[2:16:55] and uhuh I stay away from such people so
[2:16:58] it's right for you to associate yourself
[2:17:01] with people who are helping you to move
[2:17:03] in the right direction in your life can
[2:17:04] you say Amen to that am all right we
[2:17:08] have another question
[2:17:10] here why do white people why do white
[2:17:14] Believers de when they are still young
[2:17:17] yet is not okay to do it
[2:17:20] here I think this is the question I was
[2:17:23] meaning um I hope you meant courting to
[2:17:28] marry I hope you did not mean dating
[2:17:31] because no believer
[2:17:32] dats or I mean no believer goes in the
[2:17:35] way of the world of dating all believers
[2:17:38] caught in order for them to get into a
[2:17:40] marriage Union whether they are white or
[2:17:43] old but I think you're meaning why do
[2:17:45] white
[2:17:46] believers M young is that the
[2:17:51] question uh and yet we don't do it here
[2:17:54] I don't think that we don't do it here
[2:17:56] it's you who doesn't want to do it
[2:17:59] here H Brother Sam how old are you do
[2:18:02] you mind telling us your
[2:18:05] age 23 you are not married who refused
[2:18:09] you to get
[2:18:10] married is there anyone who refused you
[2:18:13] you see it is your
[2:18:14] choice me I'm 32 now
[2:18:18] at 21 I at 19 I decided to get married
[2:18:22] I'm in Uganda so don't say we don't do
[2:18:24] it here we do it
[2:18:25] here that is if you have purpose and a
[2:18:28] vision and you desire it you plan for it
[2:18:31] you pray for it you believe for it and
[2:18:33] you pursue it and you'll attain
[2:18:35] it so and I as your pastor will
[2:18:38] encourage you I don't want to encourage
[2:18:39] L people who don't want to work who
[2:18:41] don't want to go to school who are good
[2:18:43] for nothing and they they are saying
[2:18:44] they're going to get married how will
[2:18:45] you take care of someone's daughter but
[2:18:48] I should also say it is a bit difficult
[2:18:50] in Africa because uh of our livelihood
[2:18:53] and means of income and jobs and lack of
[2:18:55] them and but with the children of God we
[2:18:58] live in another economy if you are you
[2:19:00] desired something God will not remove it
[2:19:02] away from you he will give it to you if
[2:19:03] you desire it with all your heart so you
[2:19:05] see if you desire it God will grant it
[2:19:07] to you and he gave an example here for
[2:19:09] example going out with each other having
[2:19:12] meals together and
[2:19:14] more I think he's trying to say in some
[2:19:17] circles there is restrictions oh when
[2:19:19] you are you are you are courting you
[2:19:22] can't go out for a meal together you
[2:19:24] can't uhuh brother come here you are in
[2:19:28] courtship come and help us to understand
[2:19:31] this H yes you have finished courtship
[2:19:34] you are still in courtship you are the
[2:19:35] climax of it you you have now engaged
[2:19:39] have you ever taken her for a meal or
[2:19:42] for something nice or ice cream or just
[2:19:45] something nice have you ever had that
[2:19:47] moment with
[2:19:48] yes Pastor have you heard that so what
[2:19:51] who told you we don't do it
[2:19:54] here I don't know which Doctrine you are
[2:19:56] hearing from God bless you but as far as
[2:19:59] we are concerned here we do it we do it
[2:20:02] but ours should be in the light
[2:20:04] okay
[2:20:06] amen yeah so that one is
[2:20:09] answered okay can someone with the Holy
[2:20:12] Ghost watch a football match when he
[2:20:13] enjoys football
[2:20:16] Hallelujah
[2:20:21] I want
[2:20:23] to I I I want to uh to believe either
[2:20:26] you you don't have the Holy Ghost or you
[2:20:28] have the Holy Ghost one of the two but
[2:20:30] um let me say if you have the Holy Ghost
[2:20:33] he will lead you into all
[2:20:36] truth
[2:20:37] okay I've met brothers who say it's not
[2:20:40] wrong to watch
[2:20:42] football but it is wrong to watch
[2:20:45] movies and um
[2:20:47] I've met others I I asked the question
[2:20:50] why and I was told because movies are
[2:20:52] from Hollywood and brother bam condemned
[2:20:55] Hollywood but he never condemned
[2:20:58] football okay so then
[2:21:00] uh why is it wrong then to watch
[2:21:05] movies when it is acted by
[2:21:08] non-believers and then it is right to
[2:21:11] watch football that is acted by
[2:21:12] nonbelievers and they almost these days
[2:21:15] do the same thing you know things like
[2:21:18] it is in movies is it correct some of
[2:21:21] them even weird and even worse in
[2:21:23] football because there is a spirit
[2:21:25] behind every one of these activities and
[2:21:28] we don't want to be as saying that
[2:21:30] football is a scene I'm not one of those
[2:21:33] people that preach that football is a
[2:21:35] sin or watching videos is a sin I don't
[2:21:38] believe that either I believe that
[2:21:41] whatever we watch uh whether for
[2:21:44] entertainment or for nourishment or for
[2:21:47] relaxing or for free time should be uh
[2:21:51] not against our Christian principles if
[2:21:54] it is stay away from it if it is not
[2:21:57] then the holy spirit will lead you on
[2:21:59] one by one what you should do and not do
[2:22:02] myself I don't know about enjoying
[2:22:04] football I've never enjoyed football so
[2:22:06] I don't know really I can't talk about
[2:22:08] that I don't know I don't understand
[2:22:09] I've never enjoyed football so if
[2:22:11] someone enjoys football maybe they would
[2:22:13] want to answer that question anybody
[2:22:15] here who enjoys football come come and
[2:22:17] answer come and
[2:22:20] answer
[2:22:22] huh you enjoy playing you enjoy watching
[2:22:26] you enjoy watching come and tell us
[2:22:28] about that enjoyment I've never
[2:22:29] understood it
[2:22:34] come
[2:22:40] huh the brother is not ready to stand
[2:22:43] for his words so but as far as I'm
[2:22:46] concerned I I will say this on this
[2:22:48] statement what I can understand that uh
[2:22:51] when you are a
[2:22:53] Christian and you come to the Lord you
[2:22:55] will have a lot of things that you will
[2:22:57] be interested in before you come to the
[2:22:59] Lord a lot of desires you will have for
[2:23:02] instance others will love will have a as
[2:23:05] a passion to go for table
[2:23:08] tennis others football others volleyball
[2:23:12] others a lot of things of recreation
[2:23:16] like
[2:23:18] pool
[2:23:19] chess
[2:23:21] cards um there many many things you know
[2:23:24] watching Hollywood movies and things
[2:23:26] like that but when you come to Jesus
[2:23:28] Christ Slowly by slowly he begins that's
[2:23:31] why they call it h brainwashing because
[2:23:34] he begins to tune and F tune your mind
[2:23:37] and desires to something else there's a
[2:23:40] brother spoke to in um from the US a
[2:23:43] young man they were visiting here and
[2:23:47] and he told me he was a great lover of
[2:23:49] football great lover well of course not
[2:23:52] knowing knowing that football in itself
[2:23:54] is not a scene and there is no problem
[2:23:56] with watching football or playing
[2:23:58] football and so he was a great love of
[2:24:01] football and then you see he he realized
[2:24:04] that thing was getting a hold of him you
[2:24:07] know whenever the you know they scoring
[2:24:09] a goal ah he's getting crazy they
[2:24:11] banging the wall hes you know and then
[2:24:14] he was listening to the sermon of
[2:24:15] brother bham one time and he he had
[2:24:17] brother bam say if the thing is getting
[2:24:19] a hold of you get rid of it and then the
[2:24:22] Holy Spirit spoke to him isn't this
[2:24:24] getting really a hold of you and he from
[2:24:27] that moment he began distancing himself
[2:24:30] from it now it was an experience he had
[2:24:33] with the Holy Spirit and I believe
[2:24:34] whoever asked this question to begin
[2:24:37] with you need to receive the Holy Spirit
[2:24:40] and then he will guide you on some of
[2:24:41] these individual things especially
[2:24:44] things that are not written in the Bible
[2:24:45] or brother bam doesn't have an think
[2:24:47] about it because I know here in Africa
[2:24:50] many churches and preachers are opposed
[2:24:51] to football as if it is a sin I for one
[2:24:54] do not believe football is a sin but I
[2:24:57] believe that if you come to the Lord and
[2:24:59] you really are filled with the Holy
[2:25:01] Ghost your desires will not be on things
[2:25:04] below it will be on things above you
[2:25:07] know you will uh your appetites will
[2:25:09] change how how many have you ever seen a
[2:25:11] pregnant woman their appetite changes
[2:25:13] you see that's what I want to say on
[2:25:15] that you find people watching football
[2:25:17] walking at night going to watch football
[2:25:19] I believe that uh if you are a born
[2:25:21] again Son of God you'll have different
[2:25:23] appetites
[2:25:32] yes why didn't you give her a microphone
[2:25:35] there are some people streaming and they
[2:25:36] would want to hear the
[2:25:38] question CU me I used to watch those Z
[2:25:41] football matches and after I was used to
[2:25:45] bating I could could put that my mind
[2:25:48] and after thinking that I'm going to get
[2:25:49] more but they told they told me that
[2:25:52] brother told me that it is it is bad
[2:25:55] okay then comes these things connected
[2:25:58] to football cards and other things now
[2:26:02] that one is outrightly a sin cuz I
[2:26:05] believe betting is a sin Christians
[2:26:08] don't
[2:26:08] bet um it's scriptural it's biblical I
[2:26:12] don't have time to go into all the
[2:26:13] scriptures but if you want it you will
[2:26:14] come and and see me I'll give you the
[2:26:15] scriptures and so but football in itself
[2:26:18] is no sin but those things attached to
[2:26:21] it no you know you find you find uh a
[2:26:24] lot of things attached to these things
[2:26:26] um and in the church ede book brother
[2:26:28] bam also says the people of the world
[2:26:31] when they are watching football their
[2:26:33] football matches they are so what excit
[2:26:36] excited and enthused about it and they
[2:26:39] shout but for
[2:26:42] us but for us who are children of God
[2:26:46] when we we in church and hearing the
[2:26:48] word of God we also get excited and
[2:26:49] Shout like they do when they're watching
[2:26:52] their football matches and then they
[2:26:55] don't like
[2:26:56] us for shouting and yet they they want
[2:27:01] themselves to shout you get a point when
[2:27:03] I when I read that I felt like ah so
[2:27:06] theirs ours theirs ours what is our team
[2:27:10] our team is the scoring team and that is
[2:27:11] the team of our Lord Jesus Christ so I I
[2:27:14] believe that we should be focused on
[2:27:16] that and and not the not the latter all
[2:27:19] right could you please elaborate one
[2:27:21] brother Bam's
[2:27:23] prophecies who asked this question
[2:27:25] because I need you to elaborate on your
[2:27:28] question please it's a good question
[2:27:30] yeah give him a microphone let
[2:27:32] him let him uh keep that microphone on
[2:27:36] so that
[2:27:40] uh I meant I meant could you please what
[2:27:43] elaborate on R's prophecies that he had
[2:27:47] what do you mean you want me to tell you
[2:27:50] the prophecies he had he gave yes you
[2:27:53] don't know
[2:27:57] any I know I know but I'm not so uh you
[2:28:02] know I need to understand your question
[2:28:03] because I want to understand the
[2:28:05] magnitude of it do you want me to tell
[2:28:07] you all the prophecies brother bham gave
[2:28:09] or you've what's the background of your
[2:28:13] question okay let me give an example of
[2:28:15] a prophecy of this American woman e and
[2:28:19] who is on the on the camera can this
[2:28:20] camera
[2:28:22] turn
[2:28:24] yes giving an example of this American
[2:28:27] woman
[2:28:29] not I really I just see people talking
[2:28:32] but I don't really about
[2:28:34] it oh the vice president of the US yes
[2:28:39] oh okay so brother banam gave seven
[2:28:42] prophecies that 19 1933 and he say that
[2:28:46] these prophecies will come to pass
[2:28:49] before the end all of them seven
[2:28:51] prophecies and almost all of them have
[2:28:53] come to pass except for I think about
[2:28:55] one which is um the destruction of the
[2:28:57] US by
[2:28:59] Russia and uh also all the others I
[2:29:02] think have all come to pass one of them
[2:29:04] was that America will
[2:29:07] have a woman president or a vice
[2:29:10] president and remember this was
[2:29:13] before America allowed women to vote
[2:29:17] can you imagine that and he would see a
[2:29:19] woman being a vice president or a
[2:29:21] president meaning a woman of influence
[2:29:23] in America and he even for told how she
[2:29:26] would be
[2:29:27] dressed and it happened exactly and so
[2:29:30] this is that was just one of the
[2:29:32] prophecies he also for told about um
[2:29:34] musolini invading um uh Ethiopia and it
[2:29:39] also came to pass and many other
[2:29:40] prophecies I think if you come to me
[2:29:42] I'll give you a full list of them there
[2:29:44] are many other prophecies that he has
[2:29:45] told and uh they have all come to pass
[2:29:51] okay what is suffering and how do you
[2:29:54] know that you are a
[2:29:58] victim
[2:30:01] H this is a difficult one now for
[2:30:05] me
[2:30:09] because I can tell you what suffering is
[2:30:11] but again you cannot know what suffering
[2:30:13] is unless you experience
[2:30:14] it um
[2:30:17] who has who has ever gone through
[2:30:19] suffering and they defeated it and they
[2:30:22] have a testimony and can explain to us
[2:30:23] what suffering is please
[2:30:27] anybody ah all of you have never gone
[2:30:29] through
[2:30:31] suffering
[2:30:34] yes you
[2:30:38] have God bless
[2:30:40] you last time I went to school for those
[2:30:44] past months a few months I joined late
[2:30:47] so I had to
[2:30:52] suffer that you know when I was joining
[2:30:55] the director told me so Dixon you're
[2:30:57] going to suffer locally
[2:31:00] why why these people had already the C
[2:31:04] might did that the certificate had
[2:31:05] changed bch changes every five years so
[2:31:08] it has it had changed so what I did was
[2:31:12] meaning nothing so I had to do an extra
[2:31:15] a b a big
[2:31:18] work so I had to do like 10 units in
[2:31:22] that period of time and this people that
[2:31:25] I I was with they were doing only three
[2:31:28] units so you see now this teacher needs
[2:31:33] his assessment the other one like five
[2:31:35] teachers need their
[2:31:37] assessments you one
[2:31:39] person within a few time and I used to
[2:31:42] come here on
[2:31:44] weekends I don't have time to do so I us
[2:31:47] to suffer in that way but I thank
[2:31:50] God it it has all come to the end
[2:31:54] that I finished
[2:31:59] all so you were a victim of
[2:32:03] suffer and kind of uh look at
[2:32:15] that
[2:32:24] so uh this brother is um saying that he
[2:32:27] suffered at school and suffering can be
[2:32:30] I think to me like your was physical
[2:32:33] suffering or mental
[2:32:35] suffering you can have mental suffering
[2:32:37] physical suffering spiritual
[2:32:39] suffering when you being tormented or
[2:32:42] when you're going through a difficult
[2:32:43] time or when you are poor sometimes when
[2:32:46] you are poor you have no money you are
[2:32:47] going to suffer
[2:32:49] financially how many have suffered
[2:32:51] financially before you have no food you
[2:32:53] have no transport you have no money to
[2:32:55] pay bills some of you you have no money
[2:32:58] to pay rent and you are suffering
[2:32:59] terribly you don't have anyone to ask
[2:33:01] money from and you are suffering
[2:33:03] suffering comes in many forms sometimes
[2:33:06] you can be with someone who is abusing
[2:33:07] you mentally physically or spiritually
[2:33:09] in many ways and you see these things
[2:33:11] will make you suffer in many different
[2:33:12] ways so suffering you know when you a
[2:33:15] victim surely you know when you're a
[2:33:17] victim and I think uh that one answers
[2:33:20] that but God delivers from every
[2:33:23] suffering
[2:33:25] amen all right we continue on here you
[2:33:29] know I am a youth right ah this is the
[2:33:32] one I was telling you
[2:33:34] about you know I am a youth right there
[2:33:37] are some Temptations and sometimes you
[2:33:39] fall for them cuz you know no one's
[2:33:43] looking at you how can you resist
[2:33:48] receive the Holy Spirit when you receive
[2:33:50] the Holy Spirit he will be with you at
[2:33:52] all times he abides In You by the way
[2:33:54] the holy spirit is the only solution for
[2:33:56] this answer the by the way to some of
[2:33:59] you who have not Holy Spirit or who have
[2:34:00] never had an
[2:34:01] experience find it you you will get it
[2:34:04] find it when you receive the Holy Spirit
[2:34:07] you know and when it happens to you you
[2:34:10] realize you have a secret power to be
[2:34:13] able to overcome The Temptations you've
[2:34:15] been going through and you'll be able to
[2:34:18] resist because he gives you what we
[2:34:20] would call
[2:34:22] self-control I am
[2:34:25] someone can someone leave brother bham
[2:34:28] and go with the
[2:34:32] Bible
[2:34:34] hallelujah
[2:34:35] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:34:38] again that's a good question can someone
[2:34:41] leave by the banam and go with the Bible
[2:34:44] now I don't know what you meant but I
[2:34:48] don't believe that anybody is going with
[2:34:50] brother bam to begin
[2:34:52] with who is going with brother bam
[2:34:57] here some people are now shocked Pastor
[2:35:00] what do you mean who said I don't
[2:35:03] believe brother bam is Malachi 4 who
[2:35:06] said I don't believe by bam is the
[2:35:07] prophet who said I don't believe that
[2:35:09] brother bam has revealed all the
[2:35:10] mysteries of the Bible but let me ask
[2:35:13] you a question did Brother banam come to
[2:35:15] lead you to brother
[2:35:17] bham
[2:35:19] yes sister brother bham came to lead you
[2:35:21] to brother bham brother bham came to
[2:35:24] lead you to
[2:35:25] who actually I've never found any
[2:35:28] message of any other man you find every
[2:35:31] message the message of Billy Graham or
[2:35:33] Roberts even some of the our preachers
[2:35:35] here like kakan gra and others all their
[2:35:39] messages is pointing to
[2:35:41] themselves I'm the man I'm the man I'm
[2:35:43] the man but the message of brother bam
[2:35:46] has pointed people to Jesus Christ and
[2:35:48] that's why I follow it with all my heart
[2:35:51] and there is no way you can understand
[2:35:53] the Bible fully without believing the
[2:35:56] message of brother
[2:35:58] bam maybe if your question was can I
[2:36:01] leave the message of brother bam and go
[2:36:04] with the Bible how possible is
[2:36:07] it let me put it to a test come here
[2:36:11] brother stand right here with your
[2:36:14] microphone right there on the
[2:36:17] platform I I want to put this to a test
[2:36:20] can you leave by Bam by Bam's message
[2:36:23] and go with the
[2:36:25] Bible I don't care what your answer will
[2:36:27] be yes or no I want to ask you a
[2:36:29] question are you
[2:36:32] baptized can you speak through the
[2:36:34] microphone yes I'm baptized um in what
[2:36:38] name Lord Jesus Christ how did you know
[2:36:43] that before you heard about the message
[2:36:46] of by bam were you baptized like that no
[2:36:49] no ah do you believe in one God yes what
[2:36:54] is his
[2:36:56] name Lord Jesus Christ so did you know
[2:36:59] that before the message of brother
[2:37:01] bam no no oh so Adam and Eve in the
[2:37:07] Garden of Eden had an
[2:37:12] apple did they have an
[2:37:14] apple
[2:37:16] did they eat an apple yes or no no no
[2:37:20] uhhuh what actually was
[2:37:23] done do you had
[2:37:27] sex so typic can answer from a young man
[2:37:30] it was adultery
[2:37:32] right okay they had adultery she had
[2:37:36] adultery that was the original scene how
[2:37:39] did you know that did you know that
[2:37:40] before the message of brother
[2:37:41] banam no no ah what what else then do
[2:37:46] you know about the
[2:37:49] Bible you believe in the Rapture
[2:37:52] yes uh who is going to go in the Rapture
[2:37:56] me did you know that before the message
[2:37:59] of brother bam came to
[2:38:04] you I was in process you were in process
[2:38:09] you were not
[2:38:10] sure so can I say because of the message
[2:38:13] ofam you became sure yes and you sure
[2:38:16] you not going to be left yes you are
[2:38:17] 100% sure because of the message of
[2:38:19] brother bam yes so then tell me can you
[2:38:23] put the message of B ban side and still
[2:38:26] go to the Bible no now if you say you
[2:38:30] will you are lying because the message
[2:38:32] ofam has already brought you to the
[2:38:34] truth do you understand that
[2:38:36] illustration so anybody who will say
[2:38:39] they are leaving brother Bam's message
[2:38:41] they are lying if they're leaving
[2:38:43] brother Bam's message they should leave
[2:38:44] all the revelations behind
[2:38:46] and if you leave all the revelations
[2:38:47] behind you leaving the
[2:38:49] Bible the message and the Bible is one
[2:38:52] amen praise God let me now quickly try
[2:38:55] to sum up here how can a
[2:38:57] friend how can a gifted believer
[2:39:00] live for example if they are gifted with
[2:39:03] dancing
[2:39:06] H can they okay can they dance
[2:39:09] traditional dances
[2:39:12] [Music]
[2:39:14] EG
[2:39:21] raraka
[2:39:24] maganda
[2:39:27] TW TW dance TW what is
[2:39:33] TW what is twer
[2:39:39] dance okay we have known it is a dance
[2:39:42] if they are gifted in such a dancing and
[2:39:44] in message churches we do less dancing
[2:39:48] ah now let me tell you culture is not
[2:39:53] bad as long as it does not crash with
[2:39:55] the word but the moment culture crashes
[2:39:58] with the word then it becomes bad I've
[2:40:02] seen most of these people when they are
[2:40:03] going to dance they begin by painting
[2:40:05] themselves like
[2:40:08] um this how do they call
[2:40:13] them how do we call the
[2:40:18] whether they're dancing kadodi or they
[2:40:19] doing imalu or they doing whatever you
[2:40:21] know they they they paint themselves
[2:40:24] like um brother bam used the word what
[2:40:26] is it
[2:40:27] heathens now what we call heathens we
[2:40:30] Christians what we call heathens is our
[2:40:32] traditions did you know that did you
[2:40:34] know that heathenism is our
[2:40:38] Traditions I've been to kja in
[2:40:42] kja culturally they cut themselves
[2:40:45] culturally as a sign of beauty and
[2:40:47] maturity different kind of
[2:40:50] cuttings now when you were a Kong and
[2:40:53] you were a warrior you even do some
[2:40:55] paintings and you put some things to
[2:40:57] scare your you know to look like a
[2:40:59] warrior and you dress a certain way but
[2:41:02] the moment they believe those are the
[2:41:04] first things they change because they
[2:41:06] are
[2:41:06] believers but naturally Kong Dance by
[2:41:10] jumping you've seen some of is there any
[2:41:13] brother from Kong here k
[2:41:17] not today we have several of them in the
[2:41:19] church you see they jump they
[2:41:24] jump brother Solomon knows how they jump
[2:41:26] like how the Kong Brothers jump they
[2:41:29] jump so high until they almost hit the
[2:41:32] roof culturally they dance like that
[2:41:35] when they are when they dancing when
[2:41:37] they going to hunt or when they going to
[2:41:38] you know kill certain things or whatever
[2:41:41] now even Believers when they believed
[2:41:43] they left everything but they never left
[2:41:46] that kind of jumping because it doesn't
[2:41:48] clash with the message does
[2:41:50] it now you find some of the dances which
[2:41:53] are very sexual okay in some traditions
[2:41:57] you
[2:42:00] find you sincerely it is not calmly for
[2:42:05] a Believer to do that is it they they
[2:42:10] they act weird there are certain things
[2:42:13] Believers don't do because they act
[2:42:14] weird but if something does not clash
[2:42:17] with the when I went to Ethiopia
[2:42:19] Ethiopian people are very cultural
[2:42:21] people very cultural very cultural is
[2:42:23] the country in in Africa that is more
[2:42:26] cultural than any other because they
[2:42:27] were never colonized now in going to
[2:42:30] Ethiopia I found this Brothers they have
[2:42:32] many cultures they dancing they way of
[2:42:36] greeting you know they hug each other
[2:42:40] even boys and girls they hug and kiss
[2:42:42] you know so you find a sister kissing
[2:42:47] saying and then and then they also give
[2:42:50] gusa you know gusa feeding using the
[2:42:53] hands to your
[2:42:54] mouth you see if someone is close to you
[2:42:57] or your friend like these questions you
[2:42:59] have been asking if someone is my friend
[2:43:01] even if it's a boy or girl hey that's
[2:43:03] what they do they feed on the mouth they
[2:43:05] don't use a fork or a
[2:43:07] Spoon Hands bare hands feed you and then
[2:43:11] push it there so you see now when first
[2:43:14] the first time was being gred I had to
[2:43:18] sweat thank God my wife was there but it
[2:43:21] was a very tough time because these are
[2:43:24] people you want to preach to they have
[2:43:25] not yet understood the truth and if you
[2:43:27] refuse the grer it is almost like
[2:43:30] refusing them and how can they accept
[2:43:32] what you
[2:43:32] have that's why it is good to go on
[2:43:35] those mission trips with your wife or
[2:43:37] with a brother it's not good to go
[2:43:43] alone go with someone
[2:43:46] and so you see um but some but we had to
[2:43:49] bring it down to them and teach them
[2:43:51] some of the things of the cultures they
[2:43:53] had to leave them like you know hugging
[2:43:55] you know because we have been taught by
[2:43:57] the by our Prophet that you know hugging
[2:43:59] as long as you are a man as long as you
[2:44:01] are a man and you have blood in your in
[2:44:04] your body you cannot hug a woman and you
[2:44:07] remain the same is that a
[2:44:09] man that's the truth you cannot h a
[2:44:12] woman and remain the same because the
[2:44:14] blood that blood in you will begin going
[2:44:17] at a very first rate and before you know
[2:44:18] it something may happen you will not
[2:44:20] remain the same brother Dixon Don't Hug
[2:44:22] a sister you see that's why we don't hug
[2:44:25] sisters now for them they were hugging I
[2:44:27] had to show them that quote and I told
[2:44:28] them you see
[2:44:30] because
[2:44:32] theen and that's why our Prophet told us
[2:44:35] that and when you do it you you're fine
[2:44:38] I've seen some people who have told me
[2:44:40] Pastor I fail in sin because I was
[2:44:43] hugging sisters I was hugging them and
[2:44:45] then eventually yes it has happened and
[2:44:47] that's why we should follow what we are
[2:44:49] taught and uh we shall be fine so some
[2:44:52] of these cultural
[2:44:53] dances are not bad and others are bad
[2:44:58] how are you going to differentiate them
[2:45:00] if you have the spirit of God in you he
[2:45:02] will keep you away from some of those
[2:45:04] first of all the way they dress the
[2:45:06] costumes they use and uh you know other
[2:45:08] things they completely hiden and you
[2:45:10] want to stay away from those kind of
[2:45:12] things uh if you have a gift of dancing
[2:45:15] certainly it's a gift of dancing use it
[2:45:17] like David used it in the in the Church
[2:45:19] of the Living God I can tell whoever
[2:45:21] whoever asked this question you have not
[2:45:24] you have not expressed your gift here in
[2:45:26] the church yet and we need you whever
[2:45:28] you are come out come out not now don't
[2:45:31] worry I'm saying whoever you are come
[2:45:34] out see me we shall we shall encourage
[2:45:38] you to dance here in the church we
[2:45:39] believe in dancing do we we believe in
[2:45:42] dancing do we so we believe in dancing
[2:45:46] in the church don't say we don't dance
[2:45:47] so much we dance and we believe in
[2:45:49] dancing but not like the
[2:45:53] Pentecostal you know no you don't dance
[2:45:56] for God like that I don't believe David
[2:45:57] was even dancing like
[2:46:00] that and then they have all
[2:46:10] dressed no no no I don't believe that
[2:46:12] that you can dance like that for the
[2:46:14] Lord okay I have another question here
[2:46:17] is it okay to dance ah I didn't even
[2:46:20] know that this was uh
[2:46:22] connected is it okay to dance during
[2:46:26] family functions like graduations
[2:46:28] introductions and
[2:46:29] weddings how many say it is okay say
[2:46:33] yes how many say it is not say
[2:46:39] no ah is it okay to
[2:46:43] dance what is a what what is a
[2:46:46] wedding excuse me what is a wedding
[2:46:49] without
[2:46:50] Joy what is a wedding without dancing
[2:46:53] what is a wedding without singing what
[2:46:56] is a wedding without eating do you get
[2:46:58] the point but still the question is what
[2:47:02] kind of
[2:47:03] dancing you're not going to bring
[2:47:05] worldly dancing on a wedding because you
[2:47:08] are now having a wedding now you have
[2:47:09] even forgotten you a
[2:47:11] Believer you I be a believer on Sunday
[2:47:13] morning but for now I am on a I should
[2:47:16] dance how can you do that you a Believer
[2:47:21] and you should dance like a Believer so
[2:47:24] some difference between you and the
[2:47:26] world you need to come to weddings in
[2:47:30] Ethiopia oh those people they shook the
[2:47:34] whole uh religious fraternity there they
[2:47:38] dance but their dances are spiritual hey
[2:47:41] very good dancers
[2:47:43] Dance one day we were dancing on a
[2:47:47] wedding of one of the people
[2:47:49] dancing you know even they come together
[2:47:51] like that and they begin dancing they
[2:47:53] begin rejoicing you know like that and
[2:47:55] you know they dance like this they dance
[2:47:57] like this they dance like this then they
[2:47:59] begin jumping and now uh one person came
[2:48:02] in so sister sister yodit I love sister
[2:48:05] yodit she called me and said see see
[2:48:07] this one this one is bringing World
[2:48:09] dances here now if you are new in
[2:48:11] Ethiopia you would be like what is she
[2:48:12] talking about because both of them like
[2:48:14] are they not world but the difference
[2:48:16] they know the difference even among
[2:48:18] their own people cuz the other one we
[2:48:20] dancing kind of good dances that are
[2:48:34] not you coming to dance like that
[2:48:36] because you on a wedding you can't do
[2:48:38] that there a wrong spirit in you you
[2:48:39] have not yet receive the Holy Spirit you
[2:48:41] see and if you have the Holy Spirit you
[2:48:43] cannot do that whether it is on a family
[2:48:45] whether it is on your wedding or on a
[2:48:47] believer's wedding even the songs you
[2:48:49] listen to or you play on your wedding
[2:48:51] you people who are going to marry let me
[2:48:53] tell you you should show others the kind
[2:48:55] of things you believe bring God on your
[2:48:58] wedding when you lift God on your
[2:48:59] wedding God will lift you in your life
[2:49:02] and in your marriage but if you live the
[2:49:04] world and you please them God will leave
[2:49:06] you
[2:49:06] alone all right is it wrong for a black
[2:49:10] person to marry a white
[2:49:12] person H who is this one that want wants
[2:49:14] to marry a white person let me see
[2:49:17] you you see you are not wanting to be
[2:49:20] seen should I also say that you should
[2:49:22] come to me privately so I can first know
[2:49:24] who you are and your
[2:49:27] intentions so then I will answer you
[2:49:30] privately okay why was sin made why were
[2:49:36] why were we punished for Adam and Eve's
[2:49:38] mistake or
[2:49:40] crime
[2:49:42] no uh we are not being punished for
[2:49:45] Adam's mistake or crime in one way and
[2:49:48] in one way we are but um you need to
[2:49:50] understand that we were born in sin and
[2:49:52] of course why was sin made because
[2:49:55] because they believed not the word of
[2:49:57] God so they did not believe and because
[2:50:00] they not believe that became sin and
[2:50:01] because that became sin and they gave
[2:50:04] birth to Children according to the way
[2:50:06] of sin because you see we were not
[2:50:09] supposed to be born in the way we are
[2:50:12] born according to the lust of the flesh
[2:50:14] we were supposed to be born according to
[2:50:17] the will of God how by the word of God
[2:50:21] by the spoken word of God and God has
[2:50:23] now restarted the whole thing by Jesus
[2:50:26] Christ and he called Jesus Christ the
[2:50:28] firstborn of all creation Now Jesus when
[2:50:31] he was born he started a new
[2:50:33] creation which creation Now is born
[2:50:37] properly is born properly and anybody
[2:50:39] who is born according to the old birth
[2:50:42] they need to be born again
[2:50:45] when you are born again what happens
[2:50:48] when you are born
[2:50:50] again you are no longer bound by sin you
[2:50:53] are above sin and uh you cannot be
[2:50:56] punished for the sin of Adam because
[2:50:57] Jesus Christ removed it praise God how
[2:51:01] do you know your purpose in life that
[2:51:03] one is a very big one depending on who
[2:51:05] is asking and what they intending to
[2:51:07] know but I can tell you what I've been
[2:51:10] preaching on this many many times here
[2:51:13] the way to know the purp purp your
[2:51:15] purpose in life is to know the will of
[2:51:17] God for your life if the moment you know
[2:51:20] the will of God for your life you love
[2:51:22] God with all your heart you receive the
[2:51:24] Holy Spirit then the Holy Spirit Will
[2:51:26] begin to lead you direct your path show
[2:51:29] you things that you must do show you
[2:51:31] even what you must take as your purpose
[2:51:33] in life uh uh and some of you you know
[2:51:37] God will lead you into a career path he
[2:51:39] will lead you into what to do who to
[2:51:41] marry what to do and then you will
[2:51:43] focus
[2:51:46] if someone has purpose in life you will
[2:51:48] see them they will be
[2:51:50] different they'll be different they will
[2:51:52] do things differently I would call some
[2:51:55] young men here but I will not out of not
[2:51:58] others feeling that I'm not recognizing
[2:52:01] them but I know a few young men here who
[2:52:03] have purpose in life if you have purpose
[2:52:06] in
[2:52:07] life you are not going to be lazy you're
[2:52:10] not going to
[2:52:11] be found rumoring you know doing this
[2:52:14] and that in other busy in other men's
[2:52:17] matters you are going to be
[2:52:19] focused on what you want to pursue and I
[2:52:22] can tell you what you cannot have
[2:52:24] purpose in life until you receive the
[2:52:26] Holy Spirit until you truly receive God
[2:52:28] in your heart he will give you purpose
[2:52:30] in
[2:52:31] life um how does one resist I don't know

[2:53:29] oh this is a good
[2:53:32] one some of these questions I can really
[2:53:34] spend much time on them but because I'm
[2:53:36] tired and time is fast spent and I want
[2:53:38] to over delay I'm now beginning to

[2:54:06] this
[2:54:07] house ah okay who are you give someone a
[2:54:10] microphone for them tell us who they are
[2:54:12] there's a sister right behind there she
[2:54:13] has an
[2:54:15] answer on your
[2:54:17] left on your
[2:54:22] left brother on your
[2:54:27] left sister who is a Believer
[2:54:31] exactly a Believer is someone who is
[2:54:34] filled with the Holy Spirit God bless
[2:54:37] you and that answers the
[2:54:40] question do we believe
[2:54:43] that do we believe that and you can't be
[2:54:46] filled with the Holy Spirit unless you
[2:54:48] believe the
[2:54:49] word every word of God then of course
[2:54:52] you get to be filled with the Holy
[2:54:54] Spirit does it mean people from other
[2:54:57] churches are not
[2:54:59] Believers H these questions are all
[2:55:02] connected I thought it is not a church
[2:55:04] that makes you a
[2:55:06] Believer all right now listen carefully
[2:55:09] I'll spend a little time on this one it
[2:55:12] is true uh you people I thought you were
[2:55:15] tired you are not tired you keep
[2:55:17] bringing in more questions okay listen
[2:55:21] does it
[2:55:23] mean people from other churches are not
[2:55:26] Believers I thought it is not a church
[2:55:29] that makes a Believer it is true it is
[2:55:32] not a church that makes a Believer but a
[2:55:35] Believer belongs to a church are you
[2:55:38] following me a Believer belongs to a
[2:55:41] church a church that preaches the truth
[2:55:45] so is every Church a believer's
[2:55:48] church please answer
[2:55:52] me every Church where even in the
[2:55:54] Catholic Church a Bible is read in the
[2:55:57] Anglican only the mo in the MOs they
[2:56:00] don't read bibles but there are many
[2:56:02] Bible churches that read the Bible but
[2:56:05] they actually not Believers of it when
[2:56:07] Jesus Christ came he found the sades and
[2:56:10] phes and he told them he called them uh
[2:56:14] you children of snakes
[2:56:16] serpents said he said you are you of
[2:56:19] your father the
[2:56:20] devil and and the works of your father
[2:56:23] you do why because they did not believe
[2:56:26] him yet they believed in Moses and they
[2:56:29] thought they were following Moses so in
[2:56:30] other words a Believer is not a Believer
[2:56:32] because he's called a Believer you can
[2:56:35] call yourself Full Gospel Church but the
[2:56:37] question is do you believe the Full
[2:56:39] Gospel you may call yourself Full Gospel
[2:56:42] but even when you don't baptize in the
[2:56:44] name of our Lord Jesus Christ to begin
[2:56:46] with you're not a Believer because a
[2:56:49] Believer begins with accepting Christ as
[2:56:51] your personal savior not so what happens
[2:56:54] after
[2:56:55] accepting baptism not so Mark 16 go in
[2:57:00] the world preach the gospel to every one
[2:57:02] that believeth
[2:57:04] and is baptized everybody who believes
[2:57:07] and is baptized shall be so if you are
[2:57:10] not baptized correctly you are not a
[2:57:11] Believer to begin with so now you can go
[2:57:14] on narrowing it down uhhuh baptize like
[2:57:17] how according to how the apostles did it
[2:57:20] baptizing an adult who has heard who has
[2:57:23] accepted who has confessed and who has
[2:57:25] you know accepted Jesus as their savior
[2:57:27] then you baptize them in much water in
[2:57:29] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[2:57:33] then their sin your sins are washed away
[2:57:34] you receive the Holy Ghost now you can
[2:57:37] say you are a Believer so now it doesn't
[2:57:40] matter which church you go to if you
[2:57:42] don't have that basic it's the Bas B
[2:57:44] truth if you don't have that you not
[2:57:47] even having a right to call yourself a
[2:57:48] Believer you a believer of what now a
[2:57:51] believer of what a Believer is a
[2:57:52] believer of something not a Believer by
[2:57:55] name but a believer of something I hope
[2:57:58] that is answered
[2:58:00] appropriately why does God give us
[2:58:02] everything we need and always there is
[2:58:06] and always there for us and yet some
[2:58:08] people don't really believe and are not
[2:58:11] Christians I didn't even know that this
[2:58:13] question were going one after the other
[2:58:15] it's good for them to go that
[2:58:17] way some people will always not believe
[2:58:21] there is a a scripture which says what
[2:58:23] if some did not believe unbelief cannot
[2:58:26] hinder God the word of God is the word
[2:58:28] of God whether some don't believe or
[2:58:30] they believe still God is God and God
[2:58:33] will accomplish his will in his people
[2:58:35] and I'm happy that I
[2:58:38] believe so why does God give us
[2:58:40] everything we need and always there for
[2:58:42] us and yet some people don't really
[2:58:44] believe they are not going to believe
[2:58:46] some of them because they serpent seed
[2:58:49] and others may not believe because it's
[2:58:50] not your to reveal to them it may be
[2:58:52] revealed to them later so don't quickly
[2:58:54] say you are serpent seed I've seen
[2:58:56] people who do that you preach to someone
[2:58:59] another kid is your serent seed don't do
[2:59:02] that it's only God who knows those who
[2:59:05] are his you you don't know the person
[2:59:09] you're calling sereny today you may find
[2:59:11] them in Rapture when later on someone
[2:59:14] preach to them you see so and they
[2:59:17] believed without your knowledge God will
[2:59:19] bring his it may not be by you it may be
[2:59:22] by somebody else but his own will all
[2:59:25] come
[2:59:26] through and some will not believe
[2:59:28] because they seren SE
[2:59:29] period what will happen to babies of
[2:59:32] Believers in the
[2:59:35] Rapture
[2:59:37] wow what will happen to babies of
[2:59:39] Believers in the
[2:59:42] Rapture the babies of Believers what do
[2:59:45] you mean
[2:59:48] exactly
[2:59:51] huh the unborn
[2:59:53] babies or the babies who are already
[2:59:56] born or
[2:59:59] both ah
[3:00:03] [Music]
[3:00:06] yes a microphone who has the
[3:00:12] microphone that only those who will go
[3:00:16] to Rapture have the Holy Spirit but now
[3:00:19] the babies don't have like the Holy
[3:00:21] Spirit they be young I think that's I'm
[3:00:25] just thinking that's maybe what that
[3:00:26] person meant in this case your question
[3:00:29] should be what will happen to babies
[3:00:30] doesn't have to be of Believers because
[3:00:32] being a baby of believer doesn't make
[3:00:34] you a
[3:00:35] Believer right but I'll would say this
[3:00:39] the secret is this it's a scripture that
[3:00:42] God knoweth those that are his we don't
[3:00:46] go to heaven because of of believing or
[3:00:49] because of baptism or because of
[3:00:50] anything we do is that
[3:00:52] amen I just preached this morning we are
[3:00:56] accepted because we were chosen in him
[3:00:58] before the foundation of the world you
[3:01:00] see so whoever you were before the
[3:01:03] foundation of the world you will be
[3:01:05] nothing can stop it and in the rupture
[3:01:07] there's not going to be a baby it will
[3:01:09] all be young adults even there would not
[3:01:12] be an old man it will all be young
[3:01:15] adults 17 18 19 around there who is 19
[3:01:18] years we are all going to be your age
[3:01:21] Hallelujah yeah in your youth we all
[3:01:24] going to be youth even me I will be
[3:01:27] younger my God the Rapture is a
[3:01:29] wonderful thing so because we will all
[3:01:31] turn younger no old man no baby no young
[3:01:35] we will all be young forever youth in
[3:01:39] our good good age so you see the Rapture
[3:01:43] is a wonderful thing and all those who
[3:01:44] are meant to be there will be there but
[3:01:48] when you come to your age of
[3:01:49] accountability and you hear if you were
[3:01:52] meant to be there you will accept if you
[3:01:54] refuse it is a sign you will not be
[3:01:56] there all right another question
[3:02:00] here in the Book of Genesis why did God
[3:02:04] say let us create man in our image who
[3:02:07] was
[3:02:08] God
[3:02:11] and who was God with to mean the
[3:02:15] hour image now this is a very good
[3:02:19] theological question which might take me
[3:02:21] time to answer and I'm not going to take
[3:02:23] time to answer it I'm going to give a
[3:02:25] very short answer if
[3:02:27] you if you are not uh if you are
[3:02:32] not if you are not satisfied then you
[3:02:35] will see me afterwards then I will
[3:02:36] clarify anybody who has asked a question
[3:02:38] you're not satisfied please see me
[3:02:40] afterwards and then we can take it on
[3:02:41] from there okay
[3:02:44] in the Book of Genesis why did God say
[3:02:45] why did God say let us so who are the US
[3:02:48] brother bam says it many many times here
[3:02:51] and I I may want to read something but
[3:02:54] because of time uh but uh in one point
[3:02:58] he says that uh we were attributes with
[3:03:02] him uh
[3:03:06] uh God dwelling with his own attributes
[3:03:11] how many is God how many is God one but
[3:03:17] is he one like your
[3:03:19] finger one like your
[3:03:21] finger no so what does that mean God is
[3:03:25] plural God is more than enough God is
[3:03:29] much yet he's one he's one in his nature
[3:03:33] he's one in his Essence he's one but yet
[3:03:37] he's more than enough not more than one
[3:03:39] but more than
[3:03:42] enough So within him were attributes and
[3:03:45] you were in him even Jesus Christ was in
[3:03:49] him cuz it was the logos that went out
[3:03:51] of him so you see th this is god with
[3:03:55] his
[3:03:57] attributes so whoever answered asked
[3:04:00] this question you must be theological
[3:04:02] theologically proper and I'm sure you
[3:04:04] might you have CAU something out of that
[3:04:07] and if you want a longer answer please
[3:04:08] come meet me I'll I'll go there are some
[3:04:10] questions have not sufficiently answered
[3:04:12] and I'm putting them on this side uh
[3:04:15] believing that whoever has asked them
[3:04:16] will come and then we can go a little
[3:04:18] deeper with
[3:04:19] them
[3:04:22] okay all right
[3:04:26] so I'm I'm almost I'm almost through
[3:04:30] total obedience to
[3:04:32] the to the total word entitles you to
[3:04:36] the Token how different is receiving the
[3:04:40] Holy
[3:04:42] Ghost
[3:04:46] I I don't think I understand let me see
[3:04:48] how different is receiving the holy
[3:04:51] spirit in Services
[3:04:54] prayer and by the
[3:04:58] token does anybody understand that
[3:05:00] question and can you clarify for me
[3:05:03] please
[3:05:05] yes who asked this
[3:05:08] question um can you clarify can you give
[3:05:11] him a microphone
[3:05:20] what the
[3:05:21] question is's asking about
[3:05:24] is the prophet said total obedience to
[3:05:27] the word entit you to the Token that's
[3:05:30] true
[3:05:31] now uh what about the instance where
[3:05:35] somebody is praying and he receives
[3:05:37] maybe some where somebody does what
[3:05:40] maybe they are preaching the word and
[3:05:41] somebody receives the Holy Spirit yes
[3:05:44] maybe we are in worship somebody
[3:05:46] receives the Holy Spirit how different
[3:05:48] is that from receiving the token which
[3:05:52] the prophet was meaning in that which
[3:05:55] there is in my understanding there is no
[3:05:58] difference the token is the holy
[3:06:00] spirit is that not
[3:06:03] so because in the message the token then
[3:06:05] he says that this is a token he gives
[3:06:08] the example of um someone that has a
[3:06:12] token and like a bu a bus token like a
[3:06:14] bus receipt that uh you need to give in
[3:06:18] order to be accepted on the bus so he
[3:06:21] says that now for for you in order to go
[3:06:24] in the Rapture you need a token you need
[3:06:25] to have that token with you and the
[3:06:27] token is the Holy Spirit you know it is
[3:06:29] tied and typed together with the virgins
[3:06:32] The Virgins needed to have the Holy
[3:06:35] Spirit in order to go with the
[3:06:39] bridegroom because there is where he
[3:06:41] says you can receive
[3:06:44] the Holy Spirit and still you go to hell
[3:06:47] with it and and still and still you go
[3:06:50] to hell with it yes yes but that is in
[3:06:54] no way saying receiving the holy spirit
[3:06:57] in your soul
[3:06:59] now I I want you to understand this
[3:07:02] people there is a difference between
[3:07:04] receiving the holy spirit in your soul
[3:07:08] and I think I was dealing with you on
[3:07:09] that and being Anointed with the Holy
[3:07:12] Spirit it on your
[3:07:14] spirit there are two there are three
[3:07:16] things number one God creates a a a new
[3:07:20] heart in you number two he fills you
[3:07:24] with a I I wish I had time to explain on
[3:07:26] them let me just throw more light God
[3:07:29] the first thing that God does when you
[3:07:30] come to him and you hear the word and he
[3:07:32] he he gives you a new
[3:07:34] heart because we are born with the the
[3:07:37] kind of Rocky hard Hearts whereby when
[3:07:39] the word of God comes we are hard we
[3:07:41] don't want to believe it we like M so
[3:07:44] now when the word of God comes you don't
[3:07:45] accept it nothing happens but the first
[3:07:48] thing the Holy Spirit does when he he
[3:07:50] comes he gives you a new heart now it's
[3:07:53] not another body's heart it's not God's
[3:07:56] heart he just gives you a new heart he
[3:07:58] renews your heart he gives you a brand
[3:08:00] new heart are you following me now we
[3:08:03] might say you have received the Holy
[3:08:04] Spirit but actually you've just accepted
[3:08:06] Jesus as your savior and he gave you a
[3:08:08] new heart which will cause you to repent
[3:08:11] last time I talked about a conviction of
[3:08:13] heart conviction comes from H please
[3:08:15] follow me closely here now conviction
[3:08:17] comes from what conviction comes from um
[3:08:20] um from being hearing the word and when
[3:08:23] you hear the word then you are convinced
[3:08:25] by what by the spirit because it says
[3:08:27] when he the spirit of Truth when the
[3:08:29] spirit of truth shall come what does he
[3:08:30] do he will convince you of Truth what is
[3:08:33] convincing convicting you of Truth so
[3:08:35] now you will be pierced in your heart
[3:08:37] and like them on the day of Pentecost
[3:08:39] said men and Brethren what shall we do
[3:08:41] so what is it it's the working of the
[3:08:43] Holy Spirit he has convicted you to
[3:08:45] believe he will change your heart and
[3:08:47] you receive a new heart now what is that
[3:08:49] it is the holy spirit but does it mean
[3:08:51] you are sealed you have received the
[3:08:53] token you are ready for the no you can
[3:08:57] still go to hell with that as much as
[3:08:59] you have believed but it's the beginning
[3:09:02] and then after that now you receive
[3:09:04] every word of God he will bring more
[3:09:06] word more you receive all that word
[3:09:08] you'll accept all that word now when you
[3:09:12] T believe all that word what will happen
[3:09:15] there is the second work that God will
[3:09:17] do in You by the power of the Holy
[3:09:19] Spirit and that is he will give you a
[3:09:22] new spirit now what's a new spirit each
[3:09:25] of us has a spirit and each of our
[3:09:27] spirit has five Doors Five Doors just
[3:09:30] like our body has five doors what are
[3:09:32] the doors to the body number
[3:09:35] one to see on the Through The Eyes to
[3:09:38] smell through the nose to hear through
[3:09:40] the ears to test through the tongue and
[3:09:41] to touch by the hands now all those are
[3:09:45] gats or doors to the body but then there
[3:09:48] is also gates and doors to the spirit
[3:09:50] conscious memory you know and others
[3:09:54] imaginations affection now all these
[3:09:56] doors you see Naturally Speaking you are
[3:09:59] born with that animalistic nature you
[3:10:03] are born like an animal you don't have
[3:10:05] regard for God even for yourself as a
[3:10:07] matter of fact many people they feel
[3:10:09] anger jealousy what else what else
[3:10:12] palice what
[3:10:16] else hatred huh huh Pride yeah what is
[3:10:22] that it is not in your heart but it is
[3:10:25] in your spirit you don't like others you
[3:10:29] are proud you are you know those kind of
[3:10:31] things when you are in the church and
[3:10:32] the word of God comes down so heavy
[3:10:35] you're like uh let the others say Amen
[3:10:38] but as as far as I'm concerned you see
[3:10:40] you know because your spirit is so proud
[3:10:42] and you
[3:10:44] even when you believe it you you you
[3:10:45] will be like yeah yeah it's all right
[3:10:48] but now when God gives you a new spirit
[3:10:51] brother brother bam says the new spirit
[3:10:55] will easily connect with the Holy
[3:10:59] Spirit Brother Sam do you know that what
[3:11:01] that means when the spirit of God comes
[3:11:04] in a service notice people who have a
[3:11:08] new spirit will easily be
[3:11:11] excitable
[3:11:18] when they receive the new spirit and the
[3:11:20] word of God comes on that they will just
[3:11:23] you know be excitable they will shout
[3:11:25] they will you know speak in tongues
[3:11:26] easily the gifts of the Spirit will even
[3:11:29] operating in them if they have a gift
[3:11:31] naturally it will operate in them
[3:11:32] through easily they will easily sayen
[3:11:35] they will accept the word of God and
[3:11:37] they will move and they'll be moved by
[3:11:39] the spirit of God why because they have
[3:11:41] a new spirit now now many people receive
[3:11:45] that a new spirit and they think they
[3:11:47] have received the Holy Spirit and even
[3:11:49] with that you can still go to hell
[3:11:51] because you've not yet been sealed so
[3:11:54] that's what B meant but when you come to
[3:11:57] the third and last level this is all in
[3:11:59] the scriptures you receive now the holy
[3:12:02] spirit in your soul because he says I'll
[3:12:06] give you I'll give you a new heart I'll
[3:12:09] give you a new spirit and then I'll give
[3:12:11] you my
[3:12:13] Spirit
[3:12:15] now this when you before I go to the SP
[3:12:18] the Holy Spirit when you see someone who
[3:12:20] has a new spirit they so good have you
[3:12:24] ever spoken to
[3:12:27] someone oh you say is very friendly very
[3:12:32] calm very nice and then all of a sudden
[3:12:34] you find out they were Christians they
[3:12:37] may not be Believers of the message but
[3:12:38] they were Christians because they they
[3:12:39] had a very soft and kind and welcoming
[3:12:42] Spirit how many know what I'm talking
[3:12:43] about very few you know what I'm talking
[3:12:46] about right that kind of spirit so when
[3:12:50] God gives you a new spirit it is not the
[3:12:51] Holy Spirit it is your spirit but a new
[3:12:53] one cuz the old one was very difficult
[3:12:57] even for yourself now he gives you a new
[3:13:08] one now when you receive the holy spirit
[3:13:12] that one it is God himself coming into
[3:13:16] your heart to seal you and when he seals
[3:13:19] you he abides he remains there he stays
[3:13:21] there until when the day of your
[3:13:23] Redemption that one is now the token you
[3:13:26] go through with it it you cannot it
[3:13:29] cannot be removed from you until you go
[3:13:31] into the Rapture I hope I I've answered
[3:13:33] that
[3:13:34] properly is that
[3:13:37] answered is that answered or what part
[3:13:41] remained
[3:13:50] sorry all right um I know we can explain
[3:13:53] it more read more quotes but um if maybe
[3:13:56] I can take a service on it pro probably
[3:13:58] and uh if you feel that it's not
[3:14:00] sufficiently answered for you you can
[3:14:01] meet privately or I can take a service
[3:14:04] on it and then clarify more all right is
[3:14:07] it okay for a gifted believer in singing
[3:14:10] to sing in a
[3:14:13] school
[3:14:15] choir or educational songs I don't find
[3:14:19] a problem with that as long as what
[3:14:21] you're singing is not satanic or does
[3:14:24] not praise and worship the
[3:14:26] devil I know of a scenario God bless you
[3:14:29] I know of a scenario where a sister was
[3:14:32] called blindly to go and visit a boy who
[3:14:36] was an
[3:14:38] unbeliever and she did not know the
[3:14:40] intention of the visit
[3:14:43] when she reached there the boy wanted to
[3:14:45] be in affairs with
[3:14:47] her and because she was scared of what
[3:14:51] would happen in case she
[3:14:53] refused she decided to
[3:14:56] accept thank God it never happened
[3:14:58] because the boy immediately became
[3:15:02] impotent but my question is what if that
[3:15:05] it had happened was it going to be
[3:15:07] called a
[3:15:08] mistake or
[3:15:11] fornication
[3:15:14] now this last question is not necessary
[3:15:18] reason being if you are a sister and you
[3:15:21] are virtuous you've kept
[3:15:24] yourself and uh you don't have
[3:15:28] intentions of going into
[3:15:30] immorality and even a man wants to rap
[3:15:33] you God can't permit it to happen try it
[3:15:36] I know what I'm talking about I've had
[3:15:39] very many testimonies to know that this
[3:15:41] is true
[3:15:43] and you yourself who has asked this you
[3:15:45] have given given another example of this
[3:15:47] same thing I'm talking about who made
[3:15:49] that man
[3:15:51] important you think it was by
[3:15:53] coincidence or you think the man was
[3:15:56] important it was God that made it
[3:15:59] happen
[3:16:01] now how about in scenarios where
[3:16:03] Believers were
[3:16:05] raped you will find in many
[3:16:08] circumstances even those who tell you
[3:16:09] they were raped Brothers if you are
[3:16:11] going to get and the sister tell you
[3:16:13] they were raped think
[3:16:15] twice in many
[3:16:17] circumstances they wanted it to
[3:16:21] happen I've seen it in many
[3:16:24] circumstances that they were overpowered
[3:16:26] and they themselves wanted it to happen
[3:16:27] but if you indeed do not want it to
[3:16:29] happen God knows you are in a weak place
[3:16:31] and God will fight for you he cannot let
[3:16:35] it happen to you if you do not want it
[3:16:39] I've had of a scenario where in a bush
[3:16:41] somewhere a Boy comes and
[3:16:44] is he he comes and deceives this system
[3:16:47] gives her soda they drink soda they
[3:16:50] drink soda and they drink soda sister
[3:16:53] says I want to go I want to go brother
[3:16:55] is saying no take more soda and the
[3:16:57] brother is taking his very
[3:16:59] slowly very slow the sister finishes her
[3:17:02] in 10 minutes because she wants to go
[3:17:03] home quickly but the brother finishes
[3:17:05] his slda in 1
[3:17:07] hour so by the time the brother finishes
[3:17:10] his s says wait for me wait for me I
[3:17:11] finish he it is already night time and
[3:17:13] he says now it is time for us to go and
[3:17:16] um by the time he says it is time for us
[3:17:17] to
[3:17:20] go it is night and dark and the only
[3:17:24] person that she knows is this brother
[3:17:26] and this brother has to escort her first
[3:17:27] says let me take you so while they are
[3:17:30] going in the in the in the bush there in
[3:17:33] the thickets on the path where they were
[3:17:36] the walking you know the villages how
[3:17:38] they can be the brother turns into a
[3:17:40] monster say sister sister now I'm saying
[3:17:42] saying
[3:17:43] this the sister says brother what is
[3:17:45] wrong with you I thought you were a
[3:17:47] Believer what I talking about you know I
[3:17:51] want and right in in in that scenario
[3:17:54] you know in that place right at that
[3:17:56] place the sister they fight they fight
[3:17:58] knock each
[3:17:59] other the sister did not say after all
[3:18:01] there's no one to fight for me let me
[3:18:02] just accept
[3:18:04] because sister if she accepted it would
[3:18:07] happen but she said I will not accept
[3:18:10] she began calling God fight for me fight
[3:18:12] for me and then while she's also
[3:18:15] fighting then she hits the brother the
[3:18:17] brother gets knocked off and he falls to
[3:18:18] the ground and the place where he fell
[3:18:21] there was a snake
[3:18:24] waiting so the snake wraps itself in the
[3:18:27] brother and the Brother begin shouting
[3:18:29] oh help help help and while he's crying
[3:18:32] Help the sister takes
[3:18:35] off so that one did not was not stricken
[3:18:39] with a spirit of importance but God
[3:18:41] fought for her by sending a
[3:18:43] snake I've heard many stories of men
[3:18:47] coming to rap sisters and and they can't
[3:18:50] do anything we serve a living God so
[3:18:53] sister don't say I will tell this my
[3:18:56] husband I was raped no we don't believe
[3:18:58] in those stories unless he believes in
[3:19:00] it not not wor me I'm married
[3:19:03] already um but if it happen to you tell
[3:19:07] her tell him the truth if he he truly
[3:19:09] loves you he will believe it he will
[3:19:11] believe it
[3:19:14] amen all
[3:19:16] right um what do you say about this
[3:19:20] cultural thing of women
[3:19:23] pulling who who asked this
[3:19:27] one of women
[3:19:29] pulling the words continue but I'm going
[3:19:31] to stop
[3:19:33] there uh is it right for girls to do it
[3:19:36] now I do not believe that that is right
[3:19:38] to do it I think in English we call it
[3:19:42] genital mutilation or whatever it is I I
[3:19:45] I I I don't believe it is right for you
[3:19:48] to alter the way God has created you
[3:19:50] just like I don't believe makeup is good
[3:19:53] or earrings is good because all these
[3:19:56] things alter the way God has created you
[3:19:58] you know so just stay natural and that
[3:20:01] is Believers shouldn't be hard doing
[3:20:03] anything like that it is not
[3:20:05] spiritual it is against nature it is
[3:20:08] unnatural it is unnatural and it is
[3:20:12] meant to bring unnatural
[3:20:15] affection all right another question
[3:20:17] here God bless you Brothers in Jesus
[3:20:19] Christ name my question is is this
[3:20:24] teenage in this Teenage life when
[3:20:28] someone was still living in a worldly
[3:20:31] life and ends up receiving the the
[3:20:36] Revelation already having a child with
[3:20:39] an
[3:20:40] nonbeliever sometimes it affects me
[3:20:42] because I stand with the word but I try
[3:20:45] to tell her about the message but she
[3:20:48] continually
[3:20:52] pretends do we do we understand that
[3:20:56] portion what what does it
[3:21:00] mean in this Teenage life when someone
[3:21:04] was still living in in a word in a
[3:21:08] Wordly life and ends up receiving the
[3:21:10] Revelation already having a child with
[3:21:12] an
[3:21:13] unbeliever so is this a
[3:21:16] brother okay a brother having a child
[3:21:19] with an
[3:21:20] unbeliever okay sometimes it affects me
[3:21:23] because I stand uh with the word but I
[3:21:27] tried to tell her who is the
[3:21:31] her the mother of the girl about the
[3:21:35] message but she continually
[3:21:37] pretends
[3:21:39] and wants to have and what hurts me is
[3:21:43] I'm the mother and father because her
[3:21:47] mother died now I'm confused
[3:21:52] here I'm the mother and father because
[3:21:54] her mother
[3:21:57] died and she no longer stays with any of
[3:22:01] her
[3:22:02] relatives
[3:22:04] because oh the mother and father of this
[3:22:07] girl died so this boy is the mother and
[3:22:09] father of the of the girl
[3:22:12] with whom he has the
[3:22:14] child okay so says and um she no longer
[3:22:19] stays with any of her relatives
[3:22:22] because uh they are not financially well
[3:22:26] good
[3:22:27] enough I supported her and she went
[3:22:30] abroad for
[3:22:33] work but she
[3:22:36] changed she
[3:22:39] changed uh even Behavior more immorally
[3:22:43] than she was what HS is she takes the
[3:22:47] message for granted already my father
[3:22:50] has a question mark with her because of
[3:22:54] behaviors and my father is a Believer so
[3:22:57] now in my heart sometimes is is
[3:23:03] uh so in my
[3:23:06] heart
[3:23:08] sometimes uh you have to forgive me the
[3:23:11] handwriting is it's quite difficult to
[3:23:12] read uh sometimes is I hear a voice to
[3:23:16] me saying never marry an unbeliever
[3:23:20] as but you're married already as long as
[3:23:24] you have a child with her never Mar
[3:23:29] sometimes I hear a voice saying to me
[3:23:30] never Mar an unbeliever as long as you
[3:23:32] have a child with her or meaning even if
[3:23:35] you have a child with her does that mean
[3:23:37] that so I'm very confused whether I look
[3:23:41] at my child I be like I wish her
[3:23:45] mother knows where God brought
[3:23:49] her she would have let the world she
[3:23:52] would not have let the world the worldly
[3:23:54] things to go she would have let the
[3:23:57] worldly things to go so Pastor I've been
[3:24:01] mentally
[3:24:02] confused number one this is good that
[3:24:05] I've read it here to those of you who
[3:24:06] are planning to Mur an unbeliever you
[3:24:08] see where you can go you'll be confused
[3:24:13] this is a
[3:24:14] testimony and uh I've spoken to two
[3:24:16] people three people today like that so
[3:24:19] please don't go that area be very
[3:24:23] patient in finding a good Christian that
[3:24:27] you should marry once you do the mistake
[3:24:29] it's going to be a thorn that will
[3:24:32] unfortunately Pierce you all your life
[3:24:35] and uh there is nothing I as your pastor
[3:24:37] can do about it and for you who is
[3:24:40] asking this question question I'm asking
[3:24:42] that you meet me uh in private because I
[3:24:45] have questions to ask before I guide you
[3:24:48] on what to do so God bless you let us
[3:24:50] start on our
[3:24:57] feet
[3:24:59] hallelujah how many are
[3:25:02] happy
[3:25:04] amen and to those of you the one who
[3:25:07] asked is it wrong for a black person to
[3:25:08] marry a white person what I can speak
[3:25:11] publicly here is that uh Prophet has
[3:25:13] told us what would a black person want
[3:25:16] to marry a white person for for what why
[3:25:20] would you want to mix races you or we
[3:25:23] are a flower garden a flower garden of
[3:25:27] God God has black red yellow pink keep
[3:25:30] it the way it is keep it natural if you
[3:25:33] mix it then you don't get black you
[3:25:35] don't get white you get M children mixed
[3:25:38] no rest so your child will be white or
[3:25:41] black
[3:25:43] so you see it doesn't bother you but it
[3:25:46] will bother your children and you don't
[3:25:47] want that to happen to your children you
[3:25:50] find that uh there is also differences
[3:25:53] in culture if there are differences in
[3:25:55] culture here in our country how about
[3:25:57] when you are crossing even races so you
[3:25:59] need to be slow on those things and and
[3:26:02] focus on your race focus on your culture
[3:26:04] focus on your race that will save you a
[3:26:06] lot of trouble that is all I can say and
[3:26:08] to you who ask this question uh on the
[3:26:12] part of wrong on the part of wrong
[3:26:14] really I don't know whether I can take
[3:26:17] that biblically and say it is wrong
[3:26:18] there are many things that are not wrong
[3:26:20] biblically but everything that is not
[3:26:22] wrong does not mean that we should do it
[3:26:24] we have to think it through pray it
[3:26:25] through and find the will of God for
[3:26:28] what we ought to do praise
[3:26:31] God so I think it's been a fruitful time
[3:26:34] I said what is on my heart is there
[3:26:36] anybody else with something that you
[3:26:37] want to
[3:26:39] say nobody so it's it's a good it's a
[3:26:43] good let the musicians come we sing one
[3:26:45] song and then we we close we close with
[3:26:48] a word of prayer I would want a young
[3:26:50] man to to come here brother Samuel
