[41:48] hallelu hallelu
[41:51] [Music]
[42:04] [Music]
[42:15] I don't know whether brother Isaac
[42:17] you're ready
[42:20] [Music]
[42:54] God bless you
[42:57] I am not
[42:59] singing I think I
[43:03] should
[43:09] brother but
[43:12] I'm giving a
[43:16] testimony
[43:18] uh I got some people were asking
[43:24] me uh they were like after weddings we
[43:27] usually see uh people coming and be like
[43:31] hey brother this and this thank you for
[43:34] what you did for
[43:40] us and even thanking
[43:43] God but uh they were like brother we
[43:46] didn't see
[43:48] you I be like when you're thanking God
[43:51] you don't have to be to be in front of
[43:53] the church
[43:58] and for the people I don't think they
[44:01] give to be
[44:02] [Music]
[44:04] thanked that I sent messages to
[44:08] everyone and those that I didn't send
[44:10] messages
[44:12] to I'm sure they know that I was
[44:15] grateful and
[44:18] my actually I'm requesting if she can
[44:24] come so um
[44:29] yes we didn't come here to thank the
[44:31] people I think because it was not God's
[44:33] appointed
[44:37] time that could have been our
[44:41] season but it was not good
[44:45] season yeah
[44:48] so uh brother Andrew yeah if you could
[44:51] also
[44:53] [Music]
[44:55] come because
[44:57] he was my best
[45:06] man I don't know I had plan to give the
[45:09] testimony today and I was not sure if he
[45:11] was going to be
[45:14] here just me a few days ago so I was
[45:19] happy so
[45:22] um we remember Andre came here and
[45:24] testified
[45:27] he was like uh so when he got
[45:31] married he got a good
[45:35] job so was like uh yes that's also a
[45:41] fact but at the end of it it's
[45:44] good also that you need
[45:49] more so um before I got
[45:53] married I was okay I was single and life
[45:59] was not
[46:00] bad and I think I was satisfied with
[46:02] what I
[46:04] had so uh the only person I used to
[46:07] discuss issues Financial
[46:12] issues both being a parent and also a
[46:16] p so uh when I got
[46:21] married I found when I spending I used
[46:24] to spend 10K per day
[46:28] it's more than
[46:30] double so I was not prepared for
[46:36] that so things got kind of hard I
[46:41] thought it would be atast double but
[46:43] then it
[46:44] got more than
[46:49] dou people can
[46:52] understand so I discussed the issue with
[46:55] bu and he was like I
[46:58] think what whatever you've been
[47:01] doing I think this time you need more
[47:07] income so of course we had put it into
[47:11] prayer so in that way um I
[47:17] remember after the
[47:19] wedding I shared with some
[47:23] brothers there was a lot of Revival in
[47:25] the church
[47:27] there was a lot of
[47:29] prophecies a lot of things which came on
[47:32] I remember you all remember that day
[47:34] when Pastor talked about
[47:37] uh you receive what and then
[47:40] specifically talked about
[47:43] cloes don't but just give me some

[1:51:47] Lord the Ang of the Lord to be
[1:51:50] around the enemy is not Happ with
[1:51:53] this but Lord you will do it
[1:51:56] any Lord as the brother
[1:51:58] said he wants to build together with
[1:52:02] her so that they together can serve
[1:52:05] God lord it's just promises they have
[1:52:08] met to each
[1:52:10] other behind those
[1:52:12] promises hearts that are surrendered to
[1:52:15] you
[1:52:17] matters you keep them away from the evil
[1:52:20] eye away from the plan of the
[1:52:23] enemy from every force of evil and
[1:52:27] preserve them Lord for your name
[1:52:29] glory in the name of our Lord
[1:52:32] Jes amen
[1:52:34] amen
[1:52:36] so we
[1:52:38] declare brother
[1:52:39] Alan
[1:52:41] and from today officially
[1:52:49] engaged amen amen you not yet
[1:52:55] married you are just
[1:52:57] engaged so this is what we
[1:53:00] believe this is how we do
[1:53:02] it I did not know that brother Alan has
[1:53:05] all those
[1:53:08] words I know him as a silent
[1:53:11] brother but I think love is just very
[1:53:15] strong pulled all the words out
[1:53:19] of and so for us we don't believe in um
[1:53:22] you know meeting out there and um you
[1:53:24] know as husband and wife before
[1:53:30] marriage and some people always put
[1:53:33] deons on
[1:53:36] them but for me I don't do that because
[1:53:40] I believe that's the work of the Holy
[1:53:43] Spirit and these are
[1:53:45] Christians if some young people go and
[1:53:47] mess
[1:53:48] up they will be accountable for that
[1:53:52] before the day of
[1:53:54] judgment but we have
[1:53:57] taugh these young
[1:54:00] people we have t you as a
[1:54:03] church and I believe this is the right
[1:54:05] way to
[1:54:08] go
[1:54:10] amen uh mlin has uh you know I think we
[1:54:15] took her in in our home since she was I
[1:54:17] don't remember the age but probably
[1:54:18] seven or eight 10 around there
[1:54:24] and so we stayed with her uh we were uh
[1:54:28] newly married with my
[1:54:31] wife and then uh we shortly after that
[1:54:37] went to
[1:54:39] Ethiopia so then that's when she went
[1:54:41] back to her
[1:54:42] parents so when we
[1:54:44] returned then she came back so she's our
[1:54:48] daughter and her mother is
[1:54:50] here uh she's who
[1:54:53] sang you can you stand so they can
[1:54:58] see
[1:55:00] yes God bless you amen and the rest of
[1:55:04] some of the rest of the
[1:55:06] family and by the way this young man is
[1:55:10] also this
[1:55:13] is so and then we I know some of the
[1:55:16] family of baka are here can you also
[1:55:17] stand so can recogize
[1:55:20] [Music]
[1:55:22] I said Rand I'm saying
[1:55:29] Al brother Alan yes
[1:55:33] thank thank you so much thank you for
[1:55:37] coming those are your chairs keep
[1:55:40] them we have given them to you don't
[1:55:43] take them but use them wherever you come
[1:55:46] here yeah so we are we are so honored by
[1:55:49] your
[1:55:50] presence trust that the Lord will uh uh
[1:55:53] bless you
[1:55:55] today we now go into the
[1:55:58] word
[1:56:00] amen I I think it's I usually let this
[1:56:05] happen because it's a good example to
[1:56:07] other young
[1:56:09] people show them look this is the
[1:56:13] way you don't just go out there
[1:56:18] and don't go out you get you call a girl
[1:56:21] you
[1:56:23] break no we don't do that
[1:56:25] here and you sister if you also accept
[1:56:29] it and you know boys begin using you out
[1:56:33] there and I really send out a
[1:56:36] warning a boy that will ask that will
[1:56:40] ask uh to meet you
[1:56:46] privately and say let us go sleep
[1:56:50] together before you're married to
[1:56:54] them that one is a
[1:56:57] fox he will never marry
[1:57:00] you some of you are here and you already
[1:57:04] heartbroken he will never he's just
[1:57:06] lying to you is using you so don't
[1:57:12] accept my daughter here whenever she
[1:57:14] received boys sending her
[1:57:17] messages she's one of the group team
[1:57:20] leaders
[1:57:23] what your
[1:57:25] group yeah yeah so she always um talks
[1:57:29] with these
[1:57:30] brothers on those matters but when a
[1:57:34] brother changes his
[1:57:36] idea love
[1:57:39] issues she will put the protective
[1:57:43] measure and many times she will tell
[1:57:45] us now look at
[1:57:49] this and we will find out one day I

[1:58:20] Angels some people would say that's
[1:58:22] being
[1:58:25] overprotected it is better you you do it

[2:07:08] to you this
[2:07:11] morning we are reading out of the book
[2:07:13] of
[2:07:16] Philippians chapter 2
[2:07:21] and then also we read in the Book of
[2:07:33] James being in the form of God thought
[2:07:35] it not Roby to be equal with God but
[2:07:38] made himself of no reputation and took
[2:07:40] upon him the form of a servant and was
[2:07:43] made in the likeness of men and being
[2:07:46] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[2:07:48] himself and became obedient unto death
[2:07:51] even the death of the Cross wherefor God
[2:07:54] also has highly exalted him and given
[2:07:56] him a name above which is above every
[2:07:58] name that at the name of Jesus every
[2:08:00] knee should
[2:08:02] bow of things in heaven and things in
[2:08:05] Earth and things under the Earth and
[2:08:09] that every tongue should confess that
[2:08:11] Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the
[2:08:20] father for
[2:08:58] [Music]
[2:09:11] [Music]
[2:09:20] amen
[2:09:22] you may have your seats
[2:09:24] please I'm happy to see brother OS today
[2:09:28] God bless
[2:09:29] you and been here for a while maybe
[2:09:32] three or four
[2:09:35] weeks and brother
[2:09:38] Baka uh has he stepped
[2:09:42] out where is he ah okay you notice I was
[2:09:48] calling brother Alan and then I said
[2:09:50] brother Baka because I was thinking
[2:09:51] about you I was in my heart I was saying
[2:09:53] oh I'm happy to see
[2:09:58] brother and I know there are several
[2:10:01] from kja also streaming with
[2:10:04] us Works inja in
[2:10:08] Moro uh I I think you work in the same
[2:10:11] organization with him I don't know
[2:10:13] whether you know that so uh but anyway
[2:10:16] we are so happy that brother B is here
[2:10:19] this so this morning I just want to
[2:10:22] speak to you on the subject of Grace to
[2:10:24] submit to his will or to God's
[2:10:47] will amen that's what I'm speaking about
[2:10:52] and um uh I have a lot of things to deal
[2:10:56] with and many scriptures to
[2:11:00] read but if you pray if if you if you
[2:11:03] pray for
[2:11:04] us the Lord will use us for your
[2:11:08] benefit you know a preacher is not the
[2:11:10] one that does the
[2:11:13] talking it should be
[2:11:15] God and the preacher only has a
[2:11:18] gift that he has to submit
[2:11:21] and God to use
[2:11:23] it so just that's why we say pray for us
[2:11:25] so we can be able to submit
[2:11:29] ourselves just as the Deacon said avoid
[2:11:32] as movements as much as you
[2:11:35] can Grace to submit to his
[2:11:41] will I also said we are reading out of
[2:11:43] James
[2:11:45] 4 but he giveth more grace wherefor he
[2:11:49] saith God resisteth the proud
[2:11:51] but giveth Grace unto the humble submit
[2:11:55] yourselves therefore to God uh resist
[2:11:58] the devil and he will flee from you
[2:12:09] [Music]
[2:12:24] verse eight Draw N to God and He will
[2:12:26] draw n to you cleanse your hands ye
[2:12:29] Sinners and purify your hearts ye double
[2:12:32] minded be afflicted and mourn and weep
[2:12:35] let your laughter be turned to mourning
[2:12:36] and your joy to heaviness humble
[2:12:38] yourselves in the sight of the Lord and
[2:12:40] He Shall lift you up
[2:12:45] [Music]
[2:13:02] [Music]
[2:13:19] amen shall we say Amen into
[2:13:22] that all right so now um when we talk
[2:13:26] about um
[2:13:30] humility uh maybe today mainly I'm going
[2:13:32] to deal with two
[2:13:36] things uh
[2:13:38] humility and
[2:13:42] pride those are the main themes
[2:13:45] really but I I just want to take that
[2:13:47] subject Grace God gives us Grace to
[2:13:50] submit to his will
[2:13:56] now the reason why we read in the book
[2:13:58] of
[2:14:00] Philippians he says that let this mind
[2:14:03] be in
[2:14:05] you which was also in Christ
[2:14:09] Jesus now he says who meaning Christ
[2:14:13] Jesus was in the form of
[2:14:16] God but he thought it not to be equal
[2:14:19] with God meaning he never made himself
[2:14:20] equal with God
[2:14:23] so what does he mean it means he was
[2:14:26] God but when he came down on Earth he
[2:14:29] never even made himself equal with
[2:14:33] God what am I saying you need to
[2:14:36] understand first of all the mystery of
[2:14:40] godliness how many gods do we
[2:14:42] have how many gods we do we have
[2:14:45] ch we have one
[2:14:48] God can you count him he's
[2:14:51] uncountable you can't count him can you
[2:14:54] place him in a
[2:14:56] bottle and you cover it up you cannot do
[2:15:01] that because he is
[2:15:04] omnipresent he is everywhere at the same
[2:15:08] time he's in heaven he's on Earth he's
[2:15:12] in you he's in me that is God the Bible
[2:15:16] in the Book of John
[2:15:19] 4:24 he says God is is a
[2:15:22] spirit so God is not something you can
[2:15:25] see with your
[2:15:27] eyes because he's a
[2:15:29] spirit but that God has been changing
[2:15:35] forms in order to contact
[2:15:39] Mankind in order to deal with
[2:15:42] us to accomplish certain
[2:15:45] things there was a time to the children
[2:15:47] of
[2:15:48] Israel he came in a burning bush
[2:15:52] when Moses saw him he knew that was the
[2:15:55] god Abraham
[2:15:58] met all right it's the same God and
[2:16:01] again when the children of Israel were
[2:16:03] moving from Egypt to the promised
[2:16:06] land the Bible says that same
[2:16:09] God would appear to them during day
[2:16:12] time in a form of a pillar of
[2:16:17] clown who was it it was the same God
[2:16:21] Abraham it was the same God
[2:16:24] Moses and now he had come in another
[2:16:28] form
[2:16:30] cloud and then at night that same God
[2:16:33] who appeared to them in a
[2:16:36] cloud he came in another form he
[2:16:39] appeared to them in a pillar of
[2:16:42] fire so by day the cloud By Night the
[2:16:47] pillar of fire but he was the same God
[2:16:50] they did not say God the cloud God the
[2:16:53] fire god pill of
[2:16:56] fire god the burning
[2:16:58] bush they simply said the god of
[2:17:02] Israel but when that God of
[2:17:05] Israel came and visited the human
[2:17:09] race Israel did not have a revelation of
[2:17:13] who he
[2:17:15] was when he came to them he came to them
[2:17:19] as a son of God
[2:17:22] and to them they knew they had the
[2:17:25] understanding that Son of God means
[2:17:30] God because a son of a cat a child of a
[2:17:33] cat is a
[2:17:35] cat a child of a dog is a
[2:17:38] dog a child of a cow is a
[2:17:41] cow what about a child of
[2:17:44] God he's God so when he spoke to the
[2:17:49] Pharisees and he told them he was a Son
[2:17:51] of God they said what you are a man and
[2:17:56] you make yourself God he never said he
[2:18:00] was God he simply said he was a Son of
[2:18:03] God but they had the understanding they
[2:18:07] had the Revelation to be a Son of God it
[2:18:11] means to be God
[2:18:13] himself and the Jews they couldn't
[2:18:16] stomach
[2:18:17] that they said they wanted to Stone him
[2:18:21] and one time they came back to him he
[2:18:24] said but tell us uh you know you know he
[2:18:29] told them he said before
[2:18:31] Abraham was I am they said what did you
[2:18:35] just say I am you remember how God came
[2:18:38] to Moses and he said I am I am I am so
[2:18:44] now here Jesus is say before
[2:18:48] Abraham was I am
[2:18:51] some of you are not even getting it here
[2:18:54] he did not say before Abraham I was
[2:18:56] there but he said before
[2:18:59] Abraham was I am meaning I was the one
[2:19:04] Abraham
[2:19:06] saw it's in the Book of John he actually
[2:19:08] said that Abraham rejoiced to see my
[2:19:12] day and he was
[2:19:15] glad and before
[2:19:17] Abraham was I am they said what did you
[2:19:21] just say did you you a man who is not
[2:19:25] even 50 years
[2:19:26] old how can you say you were there in
[2:19:30] the days of our
[2:19:31] patri how can you claim to be Jehovah
[2:19:35] God but he said if you do not believe I
[2:19:38] am
[2:19:40] he you will surely perish in your
[2:19:44] sins so who was Jesus Jesus was God in
[2:19:49] flesh
[2:19:52] Jesus is the Jehovah of the Old
[2:19:56] Testament let me put it this way the
[2:19:59] Jehovah of the Old
[2:20:01] Testament became the Jesus of the New
[2:20:05] Testament amen the word Jesus or the
[2:20:09] name Jesus means Jehovah our
[2:20:14] Salvation God our
[2:20:17] Salvation so Jesus was not a second
[2:20:19] person
[2:20:21] he was not a third person he was the
[2:20:25] person he was God
[2:20:27] himself dwelling in in the human
[2:20:31] race he came down from
[2:20:34] glory in the Book of John something I'm
[2:20:37] trying to come to Saints just give me
[2:20:39] time and and then you will see it in the
[2:20:41] Book of
[2:20:42] John if you can turn there if you will
[2:20:45] in the Book of John chapter 1 quickly
[2:20:49] now chapter one verse
[2:20:52] one he says in the beginning was the
[2:20:55] word and the Word was with God and the
[2:20:57] Word was
[2:20:58] [Music]
[2:21:03] God so in the beginning was
[2:21:05] what the word who is the
[2:21:10] word are you here
[2:21:12] Church ask your neighbor are you
[2:21:15] here who is the
[2:21:17] word God all right let's look at verse
[2:21:22] 14 and the Word was made
[2:21:28] flesh who is the
[2:21:30] word God now verse
[2:21:34] 14
[2:21:35] and the word and
[2:21:39] God was made
[2:21:43] flesh so Jesus yes was not the second
[2:21:48] person of the trinity
[2:21:54] if you search the whole Bible from cover
[2:21:56] to
[2:21:58] cover you will never find the word
[2:22:02] Trinity it is a word which was coined by
[2:22:05] Theologian Roman
[2:22:09] Theologian but it it has never been in
[2:22:12] the
[2:22:13] Bible the Bible simply says the
[2:22:17] word is God and the word was made
[2:22:22] flesh meaning God became a
[2:22:26] man God was made
[2:22:28] flesh and he dwelt among us and we
[2:22:32] beheld his glory the glory of the only
[2:22:36] begotten begotten of the
[2:22:39] father begotten how does God
[2:22:43] beget by the word how was Jesus born by
[2:22:48] the word he was not born by the last of
[2:22:51] the flesh but he was born by the word of
[2:22:55] God he simply spoke and the body was
[2:23:00] formed and here is another thing here
[2:23:03] another nugget for you this body of
[2:23:05] Jesus did not come from Mary or
[2:23:10] Joseph it came from God it was not the
[2:23:14] Egg of
[2:23:15] Mary he came from
[2:23:17] God God himself condescended
[2:23:23] and he put on the
[2:23:26] body of Flesh and dwelt Among
[2:23:30] Us and his name was called
[2:23:33] Jesus what does Jesus mean he said he
[2:23:37] said he shall also be called
[2:23:40] Emmanuel what does Emmanuel mean he says
[2:23:45] God With Us not the second person of the
[2:23:52] with us and in the book of First
[2:23:55] John chter 5 verse 7 thereabout he says
[2:24:00] there are
[2:24:01] three you can put the scripture up that
[2:24:04] bear witness or record in
[2:24:06] heaven the Father the word which is the
[2:24:10] Son and the Holy Spirit and these
[2:24:16] three one now there is something here I
[2:24:19] want to teach you
[2:24:22] the Trinity
[2:24:24] says father son Holy Spirit but father
[2:24:30] is not the son the son is not the Holy
[2:24:34] Spirit but each of them is
[2:24:38] God so in other words if each of them is
[2:24:42] God and each of them is a distinct
[2:24:47] person it means you have three gods
[2:24:53] but they tell us no no no they're not
[2:24:55] three Gods the three
[2:24:57] persons agre in
[2:25:01] one two two people come come up
[2:25:04] here I want to demonstrate something for
[2:25:07] you yeah you're getting blessings by
[2:25:09] helping me to demonstrate this thank
[2:25:12] you okay just stand there right brother
[2:25:15] now you have the first one there second
[2:25:16] one here third one
[2:25:18] here and now when you said this these
[2:25:20] people cannot be
[2:25:22] one but they can agree in
[2:25:25] one how many understand
[2:25:28] that they can agree to make a
[2:25:34] circle a circle do you know a
[2:25:38] CLE not a cirle a
[2:25:43] CLE yes they can agree to build a house
[2:25:48] they can agree
[2:25:50] but there are three distinct
[2:25:52] persons and each of them is
[2:25:55] Rich and each of them is
[2:25:57] powerful and that's the idea of the
[2:26:00] Trinity but what does the word of God
[2:26:04] tell
[2:26:04] us the word of God debunks this
[2:26:09] teaching and he says there are three
[2:26:12] that bear record in
[2:26:15] heaven the Father the word the Holy
[2:26:19] Ghost these three are
[2:26:23] one not three in
[2:26:26] one but they are one what does that mean
[2:26:31] it's all right you can go back so it
[2:26:33] means that you have God as a
[2:26:37] spirit but he has manifested
[2:26:41] himself in three major manifestations
[2:26:50] he manifested himself as a
[2:26:53] father
[2:26:55] amen God of the Old
[2:26:58] Testament he came in many forms he spoke
[2:27:01] to the prophets you know they knew him
[2:27:04] as God the Father above us God above us
[2:27:09] but that same God who was above us came
[2:27:14] down the Bible says he put on
[2:27:18] flesh and he dwelt among
[2:27:21] so then he became the
[2:27:23] son but what does the word son
[2:27:26] mean it means
[2:27:28] human God became
[2:27:31] human he put on
[2:27:33] flesh all right I told you today I'll
[2:27:36] give you many
[2:27:38] scriptures in the Book of
[2:27:40] Malachi and these have not prepared
[2:27:42] they're just coming to me
[2:27:44] now this will excite you behold verse
[2:27:48] one I sent my m messenger and he shall
[2:27:51] prepare the way before
[2:27:57] me so now this is the father
[2:28:00] speaking okay he says that I'm sending a
[2:28:04] messenger he's talking about John the
[2:28:07] Baptist and he's going to prepare the
[2:28:09] way before
[2:28:12] me and the Lord the
[2:28:15] father whom ye
[2:28:18] seek shall suddenly come into His
[2:28:21] Temple meaning the Lord the father God
[2:28:27] the creator of Heaven and Earth you are
[2:28:29] seeking for him you Israel You're
[2:28:32] praying in the temple you're waiting
[2:28:34] upon him that God will come in his
[2:28:40] Temple what is the
[2:28:42] temple the temple was the body of
[2:28:47] Jesus if you're not getting it just
[2:28:49] listen
[2:28:51] one time Jesus was speaking with the
[2:28:54] Pharisees and he said destroy this
[2:28:57] temple in one day I will raise it in
[2:29:02] three days and all of them wanted to St
[2:29:05] him how can you talk about the temple
[2:29:09] the temp because the temple had three
[2:29:14] places the sanctuary the holy place and
[2:29:17] the holy of holies
[2:29:21] and in the holy of holies was God the
[2:29:24] presence of God sh
[2:29:28] Glory he was the Cherub beims were
[2:29:32] there and so there was
[2:29:35] God and the Jews knew that is the sacred
[2:29:40] place where God himself
[2:29:43] dwells and only the high priest can go
[2:29:46] there once in a year now when Jesus came
[2:29:50] he said destroy this
[2:29:53] temple in one I will destroy it I bring
[2:29:56] it up in three
[2:29:58] days the Jews were looking at the other
[2:30:01] T where God was
[2:30:03] dwelling but they did not know God had
[2:30:08] shifted God had changed his
[2:30:11] form he was no longer in that
[2:30:14] Temple he had now built for himself a
[2:30:18] temple
[2:30:20] not made with
[2:30:22] hands a temple made by the spoken word
[2:30:25] of
[2:30:26] God and that Temple was
[2:30:30] Jesus the body so he said destroy this
[2:30:34] body in three day I will raise it up and
[2:30:39] they did and Jesus rose up in three
[2:30:45] days so he said the Lord
[2:30:48] himself you are seeking for will
[2:30:52] suddenly come into His
[2:30:55] Temple and when this messenger
[2:30:58] came his name was
[2:31:00] John when he
[2:31:02] came then the Messiah Jesus
[2:31:06] came and
[2:31:08] Jesus was this
[2:31:11] temple of
[2:31:14] God if you understand it say
[2:31:17] amen and so God
[2:31:24] condescended put on
[2:31:26] flesh and dwelt Among
[2:31:29] Us and the Jews could not
[2:31:32] understand they said how can God become
[2:31:36] a
[2:31:37] man how can God the spirit we know our
[2:31:41] fathers worshiped him that's why the the
[2:31:44] Jews rejected Jesus listen
[2:31:47] listen that's why the Jews reject
[2:31:50] Jesus until
[2:31:53] today they rejected him by the way do
[2:31:56] you know who crucified
[2:31:57] [Music]
[2:31:59] Jesus it was the
[2:32:01] Jews who took him to the
[2:32:04] Romans and and and and the Roman Emperor
[2:32:07] said the man is
[2:32:09] Innocent but you know you know the
[2:32:12] people the Jews they say don't worry let
[2:32:17] his
[2:32:18] blood be upon us and our
[2:32:22] children for you you are okay so who
[2:32:25] crucified
[2:32:27] Jesus the
[2:32:29] Jews they rejected him why did they
[2:32:32] reject him because they couldn't
[2:32:35] understand they said he's a man and he's
[2:32:38] making himself
[2:32:41] God and one of them said he he wants to
[2:32:44] take the
[2:32:45] Throne of the Romans he's making himself
[2:32:48] a king and that's why they put for on
[2:32:51] him a crown of
[2:32:54] thorns can you imagine they put on him a
[2:32:56] crown of
[2:32:58] thorns simply because they thought he's
[2:33:00] making himself a
[2:33:01] king but they did not know this is the
[2:33:04] king of
[2:33:06] glory the God who created heaven and
[2:33:10] earth he had come down in a body of a
[2:33:14] human being they did not know that's why
[2:33:17] when this man asked him say tell me
[2:33:21] about your kingdom have you come to take
[2:33:24] over me the man Jesus answered you don't
[2:33:27] know what you're talking
[2:33:29] about my kingdom is not of this
[2:33:33] world Amen Jesus is the king of
[2:33:38] kings when we say Jesus is
[2:33:41] Lord we mean he's
[2:33:43] God we mean is the creator of Heaven and
[2:33:46] Earth and the Bible here in the book of
[2:33:49] Philippians
[2:33:51] he said he made but he was
[2:33:54] God but he did not make himself even
[2:33:57] equal with
[2:34:00] God he took upon
[2:34:03] him the form of a
[2:34:06] servant and was made in the likeness of
[2:34:11] men and being found in that fashion as a
[2:34:16] man he humbled himself
[2:34:21] there is a principle I want to share
[2:34:22] with you
[2:34:24] today and I hope you don't lose it you
[2:34:26] don't miss
[2:34:28] it and if you feel you are a bit dosy
[2:34:31] just say
[2:34:33] Amen so that you don't
[2:34:35] do but I see many of you are very
[2:34:39] sober but if you're sober and you're not
[2:34:41] saying amen I know you're about to
[2:34:45] do hallelujah amen hallelujah amen well
[2:34:49] in this church we love the
[2:34:52] word every believer loves the
[2:34:54] word and how do you know someone loves
[2:34:58] what they enjoy
[2:35:00] it whether it is a teaching or a
[2:35:04] preaching so now we see here that he he
[2:35:08] he was found in a fashion as a
[2:35:11] man and he humbled
[2:35:14] himself he became obedient to death
[2:35:20] the death of the
[2:35:22] Cross he became obedient to death
[2:35:27] itself and the death of the
[2:35:30] Cross and because of that God exalt as
[2:35:35] highly exalted
[2:35:37] him and given him a name which is above
[2:35:40] every
[2:35:42] name that are the name of
[2:35:45] Jesus every knee should bow of things in
[2:35:49] heaven
[2:35:50] and the things in Earth and the things
[2:35:52] under the Earth and that every tongue
[2:35:55] should confess that Jesus is Lord to the
[2:35:59] glory of the father so who is the father
[2:36:02] the father is God above
[2:36:04] us what is his name Lord who is the son
[2:36:10] the son is God With
[2:36:12] Us what is his name Jesus who is the
[2:36:16] Holy Spirit is God in us
[2:36:20] what is his name Christ so what is the
[2:36:23] name of the father and of the son and of
[2:36:25] the Holy
[2:36:29] Spirit Lord Jesus
[2:36:33] Christ he had the fullness of
[2:36:37] God but I want you to imagine that even
[2:36:41] Jesus even while he was
[2:36:44] God he never could ever attain what he
[2:36:49] attained on
[2:36:53] Earth if he had not humbled
[2:36:59] himself there is nothing you can attain
[2:37:01] on
[2:37:03] Earth without humbling
[2:37:07] yourself God
[2:37:08] himself had to stoop so
[2:37:12] long come to our
[2:37:15] level in order for his name to be lifted
[2:37:20] and it says because he humbled
[2:37:22] himself his name is the name above
[2:37:26] every if you humble
[2:37:28] yourself in your family God will make
[2:37:31] your name
[2:37:33] great if you humble yourself in your
[2:37:36] Society in your place of work wherever
[2:37:39] you come from God will make you
[2:37:42] great this is what God
[2:37:44] does and you know there is no way you
[2:37:47] can believe the word of God
[2:37:50] without humbling
[2:37:51] yourself and the Bible says he giveth
[2:37:54] more
[2:37:56] grace you know where he says God resist
[2:37:59] the
[2:38:01] proud but he gives grace to the
[2:38:06] humble he gives Grace oh God make me
[2:38:11] humble amen the only way you can be able
[2:38:15] to submit
[2:38:17] yourself to the word of God
[2:38:20] to the teachings of the
[2:38:22] Bible by humbling
[2:38:26] yourself but how can you humble
[2:38:30] yourself you humble yourself by the
[2:38:33] grace of
[2:38:35] God it says I'm going to read this
[2:38:38] scripture in the Amplified
[2:38:42] version just listen says but he gives us
[2:38:44] more and more
[2:38:47] grace through the power of the Holy
[2:38:51] Spirit to defy
[2:38:54] sin and live an obedient
[2:38:57] life that reflects both our
[2:39:01] faith and our gratitude for our
[2:39:05] Salvation therefore it says God is
[2:39:09] opposed to the proud and the
[2:39:14] haunty but
[2:39:16] continually gives the gift of Grace
[2:39:19] [Music]
[2:39:21] not one time but
[2:39:23] continually he gives the gift of
[2:39:26] grace to the humble Contin today
[2:39:30] tomorrow the day after that he
[2:39:33] continually gives the gift of
[2:39:36] grace to the humble who turn away from
[2:39:45] self-righteousness Brother you do not
[2:39:47] need to become self-righteous
[2:39:49] [Music]
[2:39:51] you need to humble
[2:39:52] yourself if you are a sinner say I am a
[2:39:56] sinner if you not right say I am not
[2:40:00] right let me tell you the problem with
[2:40:04] Christianity the biggest problem and you
[2:40:07] have heard many people say Christians
[2:40:11] are the worst
[2:40:14] people because they're
[2:40:16] Hypocrites how many have heard of that
[2:40:20] uhuh even some people those of you who
[2:40:22] have
[2:40:23] businesses I know you cannot you cannot
[2:40:25] give brothers and sisters
[2:40:34] jobs employing
[2:40:39] Believers don't
[2:40:42] give I don't I don't borrow to
[2:40:45] brothers because the brother will not
[2:40:47] pay the sister not
[2:40:50] pay why why is it like
[2:40:53] that the reason is many Christians are
[2:40:58] actually
[2:41:00] Hypocrites they are
[2:41:02] proud they can't humble
[2:41:05] themselves they can't accept that we
[2:41:08] need to
[2:41:10] learn we are sinners we need help many
[2:41:14] times you go on the
[2:41:15] streets you want to preach the gospel
[2:41:19] no just go and preach to those
[2:41:21] ones for me I'm
[2:41:23] saved everybody feels they already
[2:41:26] pass and maybe even right now some of
[2:41:29] you are
[2:41:30] saying but what Pastor is preaching I
[2:41:32] don't need
[2:41:33] it someone else need but me I'm fine you
[2:41:38] need to humble
[2:41:39] yourself and when the word of God comes
[2:41:42] you need to open your
[2:41:44] hearts so that the word of God can
[2:41:48] come and he says
[2:41:50] submit so submit to the authority of
[2:41:56] God resist the devil or stand firm
[2:42:00] against
[2:42:01] him and he will flee from you come close
[2:42:05] to God with a contr
[2:42:08] heart and he will come close to you wash
[2:42:12] your hands you
[2:42:15] Sinners and pufy your Unfaithful hearts
[2:42:21] you double minded
[2:42:25] people be
[2:42:27] miserable and
[2:42:30] grieve and weep over your
[2:42:33] sin you find in in the churches of
[2:42:37] Christians someone can actually commit
[2:42:41] sin and remain in
[2:42:44] church and never grieve about their
[2:42:49] and they
[2:42:50] sing and they they greet each other and
[2:42:54] everything is fine how are you I am all
[2:42:57] right but when they living a rotten life
[2:43:02] of what causes that you tell me this
[2:43:06] because they can't break out of
[2:43:07] it I want to ask you a question church
[2:43:11] is the blood of Jesus powerful enough to
[2:43:14] take you out of your
[2:43:17] sin is it powerful enough
[2:43:20] but why do people
[2:43:21] stay in the presence of God and become
[2:43:25] even worse many
[2:43:28] times you just
[2:43:31] continue in your life you just continue
[2:43:36] in your wrong
[2:43:39] lifestyle and you're not
[2:43:41] bothered the reason for that is
[2:43:44] one
[2:43:47] pride pride
[2:43:49] but the Bible says here be
[2:43:52] miserable and grieve and
[2:43:55] weep these days you no longer have
[2:43:57] people
[2:43:59] weeping people even laugh at each
[2:44:03] other when the presence of God comes
[2:44:05] down and someone cries under that
[2:44:08] presence after church you will hear some
[2:44:11] young people laughing at
[2:44:14] you you saw you really you were messed
[2:44:17] up today
[2:44:20] what how dare you do
[2:44:22] that do you know you are coming close to
[2:44:26] blaspheming the Holy
[2:44:30] Spirit be

[2:45:44] addiction to a life of
[2:45:46] depression many people who look for
[2:45:48] laughter
[2:45:50] are people who are truly
[2:45:53] depressed they always laugh around but
[2:45:57] their life is full of
[2:45:58] Miser their life is full of regrets
[2:46:02] their life is full of
[2:46:04] depression full of anxiety let me tell
[2:46:07] you my brother you don't need to cover
[2:46:09] yourself
[2:46:10] up you don't need to pass yourself
[2:46:13] up there is one thing you need to do he

[2:46:27] laughter turn to
[2:46:30] mour and he says and your Reckless
[2:46:33] [Music]
[2:46:36] Joy let it be turned to
[2:46:39] Gloom and then he say humble
[2:46:43] yourselves I am going to show you
[2:46:45] examples of what I'm talking
[2:46:46] about it says humble
[2:46:51] maybe I I'll get to eat but let me go
[2:46:52] ahead of myself a little bit and give
[2:46:54] you this
[2:46:55] example here is a man his name was sa
[2:47:00] and sa was a king that God himself
[2:47:04] chose but you remember I think I will
[2:47:06] read it but I don't know let me just
[2:47:07] talk talk about it now CU I feel talk
[2:47:09] about it and this man you know he gave
[2:47:12] the
[2:47:13] offering he wasn't supposed to give the
[2:47:15] offering at that
[2:47:17] time and so he gave the
[2:47:20] offering and Samuel was the one supposed
[2:47:22] to give the
[2:47:24] offering how many have read of that
[2:47:28] before how many have not
[2:47:31] read okay so um maybe I'll read it let
[2:47:34] me give you the story here and then Samu
[2:47:37] and then when Samuel
[2:47:39] came as soon as he
[2:47:42] arrived he found this man had already
[2:47:44] given the
[2:47:46] sacrifice this man was a king
[2:47:49] he was not supposed to give the offering
[2:47:53] the it was supposed to be the the
[2:47:55] Prophet The Prophet to give the
[2:47:58] sacrifice so when you saw the people
[2:48:00] going
[2:48:02] away he called everybody he
[2:48:05] come let me give the sacrifice because
[2:48:08] the enemies are coming and we have not
[2:48:10] given the sacrifice so he made a mistake
[2:48:14] and he gave the sacrifice and when the
[2:48:16] prophet arrived he said what that you
[2:48:19] have done he started
[2:48:22] laughing you know people were leaving
[2:48:26] and I said to myself let me do it I have
[2:48:30] done
[2:48:30] it and that grieved
[2:48:34] God there is two kings
[2:48:37] here that we're going to look at today
[2:48:40] David and
[2:48:41] Saul why did God love one and and not
[2:48:45] and and and and and leave the other and
[2:48:49] [Music]
[2:48:50] and removed even he stripped the other
[2:48:52] one off of all the power
[2:48:55] he he even removed the Kingdom from
[2:49:00] his it was one thing
[2:49:05] friends
[2:49:08] pride May the Holy Spirit help
[2:49:10] us for me to impress upon you what he
[2:49:13] spoke to
[2:49:15] me he says humble yourselves
[2:49:18] with an attitude of
[2:49:22] repentance and
[2:49:25] insignificance in the presence of the
[2:49:28] Lord and He will exalt you and he will
[2:49:33] lift you up and he will give you
[2:49:37] purpose Saints today I'm going to give
[2:49:39] you a
[2:49:41] principle which if you live in or you
[2:49:44] live
[2:49:45] by you will live a life that is above
[2:49:47] everyone
[2:49:50] you will live a Victorious Life you will
[2:49:53] live a prosperous
[2:49:55] life but if you don't take this
[2:49:59] principle you will desire to be big and
[2:50:01] to achieve great things and
[2:50:05] successes but nothing will
[2:50:07] happen of all the things you've
[2:50:10] dream God gives grace to the
[2:50:14] humble this is done through the power of
[2:50:17] the Holy Spirit
[2:50:20] it is this power that helps us to defy
[2:50:24] sin and to leave un obedient
[2:50:29] life actually the Bible says here we
[2:50:32] revenge or we punish
[2:50:36] Disobedience if you can open second
[2:50:40] Corinthians chapter
[2:50:42] 10 I'm going to to read it from the
[2:50:46] Amplified so you just listen he says for
[2:50:49] though we walk in the
[2:50:51] flesh as mortal
[2:50:53] men we are not carrying on our spiritual
[2:50:58] warfare according to the
[2:51:06] Flesh and we are not using the weapons
[2:51:09] of
[2:51:11] man I have someone who is like that this
[2:51:15] morning amen I am not caring my
[2:51:17] spiritual warfare according to the
[2:51:22] flesh I am not using the weapons of a
[2:51:25] man the weapons of our Ware are not
[2:51:30] physical they are not physical weapons
[2:51:32] of Flesh and
[2:51:34] Blood our weapons are divinely
[2:51:40] powerful divinely oh my God divinely
[2:51:46] powerful Hallelujah

[2:51:51] enemy amen could be anything that you
[2:51:53] are glued
[2:51:55] to it could be a listen listen it could
[2:51:59] be a life of
[2:52:01] sin and you are so glued to
[2:52:04] it you feel you cannot break out of
[2:52:08] it why do Christians live defeated
[2:52:12] lives because they fight it in the flesh
[2:52:14] and
[2:52:16] blood from today
[2:52:19] I'm not going to do this again and until
[2:52:22] some of them give up they say for me
[2:52:25] I've tried my
[2:52:27] best God will
[2:52:29] understand he will forgive those who he
[2:52:32] will
[2:52:33] forgive you see because they're in the
[2:52:36] flesh me I can't overcome this but I'm
[2:52:39] trying to introduce something to you
[2:52:41] here which will help you to
[2:52:45] overcome he says the weapons of our faar
[2:52:49] and not physical
[2:52:51] weapons of flesh and blood but our

[2:53:18] go it says we are
[2:53:21] destroying sophisticated
[2:53:26] arguments and very exalted and proud
[2:53:30] thing that sets itself up against the
[2:53:32] true knowledge of
[2:53:37] God we are taking every
[2:53:41] thought and every
[2:53:43] purpose we are taking it
[2:53:46] captive to The Obedience of
[2:53:49] Christ being ready to punish Every Act
[2:53:52] of
[2:53:55] Disobedience when your own obedience as
[2:53:59] a church is
[2:54:04] complete now I want you to know that God
[2:54:07] hats the
[2:54:10] proud God resists
[2:54:14] Pride just listen to these things
[2:54:19] may God give
[2:54:21] us but I want to speak them that they
[2:54:23] will be deeper enter into you
[2:54:27] in this today's service my
[2:54:31] aim if you're not very excited but I
[2:54:34] want you to
[2:54:35] listen that the
[2:54:37] words these words will come and be
[2:54:40] inside of you listen first Peter
[2:54:43] 5 verse 5 likewise ye Young submit
[2:54:49] yourself to the
[2:54:52] Elder yeah all of you be subject one to
[2:54:58] another and be clothed with
[2:55:02] humility for God resist the
[2:55:08] proud tell your neighbor God resist the
[2:55:12] proud and giveth grace to the humble
[2:55:18] he resists the
[2:55:20] proud he gives grace to the
[2:55:24] humble but our generation is
[2:55:27] not we want to big
[2:55:30] things we want to be
[2:55:32] seen I did it I am the man I people
[2:55:36] don't know about giving credit to each
[2:55:41] other you know even when you know that
[2:55:44] the other
[2:55:46] person really did that than
[2:55:49] you or did it a little more than you
[2:55:52] when you get a chance to speak you want
[2:55:55] to show
[2:55:56] everybody how great a person you
[2:55:59] are what you have
[2:56:01] done praise the name of the
[2:56:04] Lord what you have
[2:56:06] done what you are the ability that you
[2:56:10] have the power that you have but the
[2:56:12] Bible says we should submit we should be
[2:56:15] subject one to another
[2:56:19] and we should be closed with
[2:56:21] humility for God resists the
[2:56:24] proud but he gives grace to the
[2:56:27] humble and I want you to listen to this
[2:56:29] scripture in the Book of
[2:56:32] Proverbs chapter 6 verse
[2:56:34] 16 he says these six things does the
[2:56:37] Lord
[2:56:40] hat yeah seven un Abomination unto
[2:56:45] him number one
[2:56:48] a proud
[2:56:53] L yes a proud L you got
[2:56:57] it a lying
[2:57:02] tongue hands that shed innocent
[2:57:07] blood let us take one by one the Bible
[2:57:11] says these things God does
[2:57:14] what if God hurts
[2:57:16] something and you you are a part of
[2:57:19] it it means you're on the negative side
[2:57:22] of
[2:57:24] God a proud
[2:57:27] look there are some people who can never
[2:57:29] humble
[2:57:31] themselves even their eyes
[2:57:34] sh you know one time I never plann to to
[2:57:38] cut this but but I just remember it
[2:57:40] now brother bam was speaking about a man
[2:57:44] finding a woman to marry
[2:57:50] and you know you know he was in a ranch
[2:57:55] somewhere and um he saw this C this C
[2:58:00] cow that really looked so
[2:58:04] nice and um and um he said
[2:58:07] my this is a beautiful
[2:58:10] cow I think it is the best and the man
[2:58:14] told him no no no
[2:58:16] no that is not don't look at the
[2:58:19] meat and the look of it and be deceived
[2:58:24] by
[2:58:25] that let me read it let me read it from
[2:58:27] the man
[2:58:29] himself William preached this in
[2:58:32] 1965 he said I used to go with a Rancher
[2:58:35] that I worked
[2:58:38] with to buy CLE and I noticed the old
[2:58:41] fellow always looking right in the face
[2:58:43] of a
[2:58:46] haer before he went to
[2:58:49] beaing young people you will love this
[2:58:53] story just listen to it very
[2:58:57] well and so then he turned her
[2:59:02] head and looked back and
[2:59:05] forth I followed him along and watched
[2:59:08] him and he looked her up and
[2:59:15] down if she looked all right
[2:59:19] the then he turned and looked her in the
[2:59:23] face and sometime he would shake his
[2:59:26] head and walk
[2:59:27] away I said Jeff I want to ask you
[2:59:31] something he said say on be I said why
[2:59:35] do you always look that cow in the
[2:59:37] [Music]
[2:59:40] face I said she looks all
[2:59:45] right said I want to tell you boy
[2:59:48] you got a lot to
[2:59:50] learn and I realized it after he told
[2:59:54] me he said I don't care how she's made
[2:59:58] up she might be be
[3:00:03] PL but if she's got that wild stair in
[3:00:07] her
[3:00:11] face don't you never buy
[3:00:15] her I said why so Jeff he said well say
[3:00:19] the first thing is she will never step
[3:00:24] put and he said the next thing is she
[3:00:28] will never be a mommy to her
[3:00:32] C and say they put her in a pen
[3:00:37] now that's the reason she's
[3:00:42] fat you turn her
[3:00:45] loose that wild stair
[3:00:49] she will run to
[3:00:52] death I said you know I kind of learned
[3:00:55] something I believe that applies to
[3:00:58] women
[3:00:59] too that wild St look
[3:01:19] [Music]
[3:01:26] there are some
[3:01:29] women when you look at
[3:01:31] them and they look at you in the
[3:01:35] face you will she's cating
[3:01:39] you she's very
[3:01:43] groomy this one is not a simple
[3:01:46] woman now
[3:02:02] and don't
[3:02:07] know they look at you and turn the
[3:02:11] eyes what what is going on
[3:02:15] here greeting her
[3:02:19] God bless
[3:02:26] you better stay away from her
[3:02:30] boy all that they all that they Bluff
[3:02:34] stuff over at top
[3:02:36] [Music]
[3:02:39] eyes I wouldn't want that I don't think
[3:02:42] that's becoming to a
[3:02:44] Christian I don't care how much the
[3:02:47] television and paper says it's
[3:02:52] pretty it is the most horrible looking
[3:02:54] hideous
[3:02:57] side that I ever seen in my life praise
[3:03:01] the name of the Lord where the Believers
[3:03:03] ought to
[3:03:07] shout and so he continues up
[3:03:10] here and he talked about
[3:03:14] that so but you know
[3:03:17] says you plan to look you have to plan
[3:03:21] now he's talking about young men who are
[3:03:22] going to
[3:03:24] Mar you have to
[3:03:26] plan you have to look and you have to
[3:03:30] pray when you are choosing for see we
[3:03:33] see by this the Word of
[3:03:38] Promise she the bride that a man would
[3:03:40] choose is going to reflect his character
[3:03:49] it reflects what is in the
[3:03:54] man now could you imagine a man filled
[3:03:58] with the Holy
[3:04:00] Spirit taking something like that to be
[3:04:02] a
[3:04:05] wife I just don't see it
[3:04:07] brother now maybe I'm just an old
[3:04:11] CR but you know I just can't understand
[3:04:14] that notice for it's going to reflect
[3:04:17] what's in him
[3:04:19] she's going to help him make his future
[3:04:25] home praise the name of the
[3:04:27] Lord you go read that message it's
[3:04:29] called the choosing of a bride is very
[3:04:31] very
[3:04:34] wonderful and so he says you know when
[3:04:36] you get to marry a woman like
[3:04:39] that with that proud
[3:04:42] look she can't even stay at
[3:04:45] home and be a mother your
[3:04:48] babies she doesn't even want to have the
[3:04:51] babies even if she had she doesn't want
[3:04:54] to breastfeed them she wants to run
[3:04:57] around in the car go here and there
[3:05:00] women in our generation no longer want
[3:05:03] to be
[3:05:04] mothers that's why you brother you must
[3:05:07] find a Christian
[3:05:09] woman because a Christian woman is ways
[3:05:12] different from the worldly
[3:05:15] women a woman who has been
[3:05:18] CH a woman who is
[3:05:21] virtuous a woman knows where she
[3:05:24] stands can you say Amen to
[3:05:27] that but when you go to see that proud
[3:05:32] look and then you go for that the Bible
[3:05:36] says God hates that proud
[3:05:40] look he also hats a lying
[3:05:44] Tong a lying Tong
[3:05:49] brother if you have a
[3:05:54] lying and hands and hands that shed
[3:05:57] innocent
[3:05:59] blood you may say well I've never
[3:06:01] murdered anybody but what do we have in
[3:06:03] our
[3:06:04] generation you see you find Babies still
[3:06:06] in the
[3:06:07] stomach and someone would decide to kill
[3:06:11] that
[3:06:13] baby and they you know will do things
[3:06:15] and they
[3:06:17] until the child
[3:06:19] dies what is it it is hands that shed
[3:06:23] innocent
[3:06:24] blood God hurts it another thing he
[3:06:28] hurts a heart that devises Wicked
[3:06:36] imaginations when you your
[3:06:38] imaginations are always evil are always
[3:06:42] Wicked you always plan evil for people
[3:06:47] others are happy oh brother and
[3:06:51] sister you are
[3:06:53] like we shall
[3:06:57] see Wicked
[3:07:03] imagination another thing he HS feet
[3:07:07] that be Swift in running to
[3:07:10] [Music]
[3:07:12] mischief and you are first to pay a
[3:07:15] bribe
[3:07:17] something as simple as a bribe on the
[3:07:22] road you know a police officer stops you
[3:07:25] you find a Believer
[3:07:27] quickly
[3:07:29] off your
[3:07:32] newspapers and you a
[3:07:35] Believer sincerely if you a Believer and
[3:07:37] you do
[3:07:39] that God is not happy
[3:07:42] with that is Fe that
[3:07:45] [Music]
[3:07:46] iswift false
[3:07:49] witness that speaks
[3:07:52] lies he that sth Discord among
[3:07:57] Brethren God hats these
[3:07:59] things you find there are some people
[3:08:01] who are very
[3:08:03] good are taking bad
[3:08:06] news taking
[3:08:09] gossip from this person to this person
[3:08:12] all of a sudden you begin to see people
[3:08:14] in the church are not liking each other
[3:08:17] what is happening when you go down you
[3:08:21] realize there are some some people who
[3:08:24] are working around
[3:08:27] the to S
[3:08:30] this
[3:08:33] among and then those people who looked
[3:08:36] to that old fisherman I want to quote
[3:08:38] something for you here and you know what
[3:08:39] they did he would have uh had some great
[3:08:42] degree to go by and he would have had
[3:08:45] something to glory in but God took
[3:08:46] nothing and made something out of it am
[3:08:50] that's the way God
[3:08:55] does he just takes the nothing to make
[3:08:59] something and when you when when you
[3:09:02] being can become nothing in your own
[3:09:08] sight you are becoming something in
[3:09:14] God and always remember this
[3:09:19] and always remember
[3:09:21] this the way
[3:09:24] up is
[3:09:27] down he that exalts
[3:09:30] himself shall be a
[3:09:32] best that he that humbled
[3:09:36] himself shall be
[3:09:39] exalted so in order to receive the grace
[3:09:42] of God for our
[3:09:44] lives we need humility
[3:09:48] God loves
[3:09:49] humility and God loves lifting up the
[3:09:55] humble brother if you know actually you
[3:09:58] can even say I sense God is going to
[3:10:00] lift
[3:10:03] me when you feel you have humbled
[3:10:06] yourself when you know there is an
[3:10:09] opportunity you would have lifted
[3:10:12] yourself but you left the the people to
[3:10:15] CL for somebody else
[3:10:19] whenever people C for somebody
[3:10:22] else and they don't CL for you then God
[3:10:26] is about to lift

[3:16:32] thing but when you are humble you will
[3:16:35] receive
[3:16:38] correction hallelujah amen I remember
[3:16:41] there was a
[3:16:44] day I had hosted by the Tim do
[3:16:49] and uh there was another brother
[3:16:52] from um Pastor his Da comes to this
[3:16:56] church
[3:17:00] she's brother Tim when he was
[3:17:03] preaching he mentioned the name of a
[3:17:05] certain
[3:17:07] man and then ascribed him to being
[3:17:11] somebody and then later on brother Char
[3:17:15] came to him he told Tim is from Canada
[3:17:18] don't know so both of them are old men
[3:17:23] so this one came to this one I told him
[3:17:26] when you were preaching you mentioned
[3:17:29] this man and ascribed him to being
[3:17:32] so but it is not
[3:17:35] true this man is actually somebody
[3:17:40] else and I was there standing
[3:17:43] watching and was like ah
[3:17:47] so oh thank you God bless you it took me
[3:17:51] all the way to come from
[3:17:54] Canada to come and learn this in
[3:17:57] Uganda thank you
[3:17:59] God but if it is a proud
[3:18:02] preacher like ah okay I already knew I
[3:18:06] just made was sleep of a
[3:18:09] tongue because you don't want to be
[3:18:11] brought
[3:18:12] down but
[3:18:14] brother Believers should break down
[3:18:18] believer should accept
[3:18:20] [Music]
[3:18:21] correction believer should accept to
[3:18:25] Lear but you see without humility you
[3:18:27] can never learn anything
[3:18:30] new you need humility even to understand
[3:18:33] the will of God for your
[3:18:38] life if you don't humble
[3:18:41] yourself you cannot learn anything new
[3:18:44] about your life from God
[3:18:49] praise the name of the Lord I remember I
[3:18:51] was in Ethiopia one
[3:18:53] day
[3:18:54] in many people at that time they
[3:18:57] couldn't speak
[3:18:59] English let alone understand
[3:19:02] it because they communicate the official
[3:19:05] language is
[3:19:07] Amar so there came up the sister brought
[3:19:10] me a certain
[3:19:13] preacher and I was um I was preaching to
[3:19:16] him
[3:19:17] I was I was supposed to like share the
[3:19:19] message with
[3:19:20] him and so um we sat together the three
[3:19:24] of
[3:19:24] us and um I asked this brother before I
[3:19:29] started through sister The
[3:19:32] Interpreter do you need interpretation
[3:19:34] or you okay with
[3:19:38] them I'm fine I understand everything so
[3:19:43] I preached to him for 1 hour and a half
[3:19:47] we were talking about certain
[3:19:48] things and um after that I think my wife
[3:19:53] was there too at that time and so after
[3:19:55] that I asked him the whole time he was
[3:20:00] yeah so after when hour house I asked
[3:20:04] him what do you say about
[3:20:06] this and he started talking about
[3:20:08] something completely
[3:20:10] different the whole one hour and a half
[3:20:13] was
[3:20:15] wasted never Le anything why
[3:20:22] Pride but if you humble
[3:20:25] yourself if you don't know say I don't
[3:20:29] know if you need something say I
[3:20:35] need God cannot use you if you are
[3:20:39] proud you can't be a good wife if you're
[3:20:42] proud you can't be a good husband if
[3:20:44] you're proud you can't be church member
[3:20:47] if you're proud you can't be a a good
[3:20:50] servant of God if you're
[3:20:52] proud you have to humble
[3:20:55] yourself let us look at a few verses
[3:20:57] about
[3:20:59] Pride look at Psalms
[3:21:03] 10:4 he says the wicked through the
[3:21:06] pride of his continence will not seek
[3:21:08] after
[3:21:10] God God is not in all his thoughts
[3:21:28] you just interpret this directly my
[3:21:30] brother the wicked through the pride of
[3:21:33] his
[3:21:36] countenance will not seek after
[3:21:39] God God is not in all his
[3:21:44] thoughts proverbs 14:3
[3:21:47] in the mouth of the
[3:21:50] foolish is a road of
[3:21:54] Pride but the lips of the
[3:21:57] wise shall preserve
[3:21:59] them meaning the wise are the
[3:22:04] humble proverb
[3:22:06] 16 Verse 18 Pride goth Before
[3:22:13] Destruction if you are always you know
[3:22:16] up
[3:22:17] there you know it all you cannot break
[3:22:21] down you cannot be told you think you're
[3:22:25] on top of your
[3:22:26] game destruction is coming to
[3:22:29] you Pride goes before
[3:22:33] destruction and hold spirit before a
[3:22:39] fall better it is to be an of an humble
[3:22:44] spirit with the low
[3:22:47] than to divide the spoil with the
[3:22:52] proud you can read that out of um
[3:22:55] Proverbs chapter
[3:23:06] 16 18 and 19
[3:23:17] [Music]
[3:23:26] [Music]

[3:23:40] [Music]
[3:23:42] 19 praise the name of the Lord look at
[3:23:45] look at proverbs 2923 listen it says a
[3:23:48] man's Pride shall bring him law but
[3:23:51] horor shall uphold the humble in
[3:24:02] spirit Proverbs 88:13 the fear of the
[3:24:05] Lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy
[3:24:08] and and the evil way and a forward mouth
[3:24:11] do i h
[3:24:33] mouth no one knows that luganda word is
[3:24:37] very difficult for people to
[3:24:39] understand but out I say it's um
[3:24:41] somebody who is difficult to deal
[3:24:45] with some who is er like
[3:24:49] contradictory and and and talking and
[3:24:52] fasing
[3:24:53] and
[3:24:56] AR speing
[3:24:59] words I don't know how many of you have
[3:25:01] ever spoken to someone and you felt
[3:25:06] sick how many have spoken to such a
[3:25:10] person where are you that
[3:25:14] person you know sometimes you can speak

[3:25:33] you you look like a
[3:25:36] pan stupid you are don't
[3:25:40] sense and those words when they come out
[3:25:43] of that mouth they make you sick
[3:25:47] you feel so bad but the Bible
[3:25:50] says the fear of the Lord is to Hur
[3:25:55] evil is to Hur pride is to Hur
[3:25:59] arrogance and the evil way and the
[3:26:02] forward
[3:26:04] mouth and God hats
[3:26:07] it and I want you now to give you this
[3:26:09] example which I showed you here in the
[3:26:11] book of 1 Samuel chapter 13 quickly we
[3:26:12] can read all of us there if you can turn
[3:26:15] there for Samuel
[3:26:18] 1 and he carried seven days according to
[3:26:21] the set time that Samuel had appointed
[3:26:24] but Samuel came to gilgal and the people
[3:26:26] were scattered from him and Saul said
[3:26:29] bring hether a burn offering to me and
[3:26:31] peace offerings and he offered the burn
[3:26:34] offering and it came to pass that as
[3:26:36] soon as he made an end of an of the
[3:26:38] offering of the burnt offering behold
[3:26:41] Samuel came and Samuel and Saul went out
[3:26:44] to meet him that he might salute him and
[3:26:47] Samuel said what hast thou done and Saul
[3:26:51] said because I saw that the people were
[3:26:53] scattered from me and that thou camest
[3:26:56] not with within the days appointed and
[3:26:59] that the Philistines gathered themselves
[3:27:02] together at Mish there said I the
[3:27:05] Philistines will come down now upon me
[3:27:07] to gilgal and I have not made
[3:27:09] supplication unto the
[3:27:13] Lorden the words I forced myself
[3:27:19] and I offered a bur
[3:27:21] offering and Sam said to Saul thou has
[3:27:24] done foolishly thou Hast not kept the
[3:27:27] Commandment of the Lord thy
[3:27:31] God which he commanded thee for now
[3:27:35] would the Lord have established th
[3:27:36] Kingdom upon Israel
[3:27:40] forever but now the kingdom shall not
[3:27:44] continue the Lord s him a man after his
[3:27:47] own
[3:27:49] heart and the Lord has commanded him to
[3:27:51] be Captain over his
[3:27:53] people because thou has not kept that
[3:27:56] which the Lord
[3:27:57] commanded now I want I want I want to
[3:28:00] examine this situation
[3:28:02] here executing a duty that does not
[3:28:05] belong to
[3:28:07] you is a pride I remember many times
[3:28:11] even when I was still in Miana many
[3:28:12] years
[3:28:13] ago I was assisting the pastor there as
[3:28:16] an
[3:28:18] associate and then some of the a few
[3:28:22] characters they would even come and
[3:28:23] visit my home my wife remembers
[3:28:26] that and you know they would sit down
[3:28:28] with you they would begin telling you
[3:28:31] you know brother when you preach I feel
[3:28:33] very
[3:28:34] happy I think you should even become our
[3:28:37] pastor and then after they say that they
[3:28:40] keep qu and look at
[3:28:42] you what are they waiting for they are
[3:28:45] waiting for you to St up with
[3:28:48] pride and say yes yes I've even been
[3:28:51] planning on it and then they will take
[3:28:53] the
[3:28:55] words brother said he wants to
[3:28:59] be and someone came up say the way I've
[3:29:03] heard you preaching I even want to give
[3:29:05] you my
[3:29:07] ti don't give it to the
[3:29:11] p and I I I whenever these cases would
[3:29:13] come to me i' rebuke them
[3:29:17] sharply is an opportunity for
[3:29:21] Pride Brethren pride is
[3:29:24] real and pride
[3:29:27] destroys Pride
[3:29:29] destroys I remember one time brother
[3:29:32] told
[3:29:33] me someone was streaming our
[3:29:37] services and they and they called
[3:29:41] him oh you a real man of God I even want
[3:29:45] to begin paying my ta
[3:29:47] you so so he came to me and said
[3:29:52] pastor there is some sheep in some
[3:29:55] country they have confidence in my
[3:29:58] Ministry what can I do brother it's a
[3:30:03] Temptation stay in your
[3:30:06] place know your
[3:30:08] calling do not overstep your
[3:30:12] boundary God uses all of us
[3:30:16] you may be young you may be
[3:30:18] old you may be big you may be small you
[3:30:21] may be rich you may be poor God uses all
[3:30:24] of us the
[3:30:26] same but you see Samuel was a prophet
[3:30:31] and sa was a king and so he waited how
[3:30:35] many days seven
[3:30:36] days and Samuel did not come samel did
[3:30:40] not come and the man felt like when the
[3:30:43] people when the enemies of Israel were
[3:30:45] coming
[3:30:47] he felt like oh they're going to come
[3:30:49] and attack
[3:30:50] us what don't I have don't I have the
[3:30:54] hand don't I have the feet don't I have
[3:30:57] the knowledge don't I know how they
[3:31:00] sacrifice he told the boys come bring me
[3:31:04] bring me those
[3:31:05] haers and he started
[3:31:08] sacrificing there were a priest would
[3:31:11] do and then the prophet
[3:31:13] arrived as soon as he had finished
[3:31:17] the
[3:31:19] job and when that
[3:31:21] happened when that happened I wanted to
[3:31:24] hear those words that the prophet of God
[3:31:28] said and Samuel said to
[3:31:30] Saul thou Hast done
[3:31:33] foolishly thou Hast not kept the
[3:31:35] Commandment of the
[3:31:36] Lord which he commanded thee for now
[3:31:39] would the Lord have established th
[3:31:40] Kingdom up upon Israel
[3:31:44] forever but now om shall not
[3:31:48] continue I want to tell you friends it
[3:31:50] is impossible to have
[3:31:54] obedience without
[3:31:57] humility Rebellion is a nasty sin before
[3:32:00] the
[3:32:02] Lord because you see he says you
[3:32:06] know as the Lord as does the Lord have
[3:32:09] great Delight in Bur offerings and
[3:32:11] sacrifices
[3:32:15] [Music]
[3:32:16] as in obeying the voice of the
[3:32:19] Lord behold to obey is better than
[3:32:24] sacrifice and to hecken than the fat of
[3:32:28] Rams for Rebellion is as the sin of
[3:32:33] Witchcraft and stubborness is as
[3:32:35] iniquity and
[3:32:41] idolatry because thou H has rejected the
[3:32:43] word of the
[3:32:44] Lord also rejected the from
[3:32:48] being I want to emphasize this God gives
[3:32:51] grace to the
[3:32:53] humble tell your neighbor God gives
[3:32:55] grace to the
[3:32:57] H he said here in the Book of James he
[3:33:00] gives more and more and more and more
[3:33:02] and more
[3:33:05] grace through the power of the Holy
[3:33:08] Spirit to defy sin and and to live an
[3:33:12] obedient
[3:33:13] life that reflects both our faith
[3:33:16] and our gratitude for our
[3:33:19] Salvation therefore it says God is
[3:33:23] opposed to the proud and
[3:33:28] halty but
[3:33:29] continually I underline this part
[3:33:33] continually
[3:33:35] continually gives
[3:33:37] grace to the humble did you know if you
[3:33:42] are humble in
[3:33:43] heart even when you go wrong
[3:33:46] he will redeem you out of
[3:33:49] that if your heart is cont if your
[3:33:53] spirit is
[3:33:56] humble in the Book of Matthew it says he
[3:33:59] he he he he he he those things from the
[3:34:01] wise and The Prudent of the
[3:34:05] world and he revealed it to
[3:34:09] babes such as would
[3:34:12] Lear God always reveals the deep secrets
[3:34:16] of his
[3:34:18] word to the
[3:34:21] humble those who can learn wait wait
[3:34:24] there's a principle here I'm trying to
[3:34:26] give if you are
[3:34:28] proud you can never learn anything of
[3:34:31] the
[3:34:32] Lord but if you are
[3:34:34] humble even when you go
[3:34:37] wrong he will always bring
[3:34:40] you if your spirit can be corrected
[3:34:45] did God take away the Kingdom from
[3:34:48] sa because sa was proud his heart was
[3:34:53] hurt he thought he knew everything he
[3:34:56] thought he was the king and he can do
[3:34:58] anything he wanted to do brother you
[3:35:01] always need to know your place and your
[3:35:06] calling and you humble
[3:35:09] yourself and and and before we finish I
[3:35:11] have a few offices I want to touch on
[3:35:16] but God has called I believe it takes
[3:35:18] each of
[3:35:21] us the Bible tells us to submit to the
[3:35:24] authority of
[3:35:27] God but how can we submit to
[3:35:30] God if we can't submit to
[3:35:35] ourselves let me first take the first
[3:35:38] office the office of
[3:35:41] children how many are children
[3:35:44] here if you're a parent don't I'm
[3:35:46] talking about the children raise up your
[3:35:50] hands I'm going to talk to
[3:35:52] youan 6 verse1 children obey your

[3:36:08] promise oh my father is difficult my

[3:36:44] young if you want to live long and if
[3:36:48] you want to be well with
[3:36:50] you submit yourself to your

[3:36:56] children obey your parents in the
[3:37:00] Lord that is accept their
[3:37:04] guidance and accept their
[3:37:12] discipline as God is representative

[3:37:37] says you have to submit your parents you
[3:37:41] have to obey your parents for this is
[3:37:44] right

[3:37:52] discipline he says honor esteem value as
[3:37:59] precious your father and your
[3:38:02] mother and be respectful to
[3:38:06] them this is the first commandment with
[3:38:08] a

[3:38:46] that they may do it with
[3:38:50] joy and not with grief for that is
[3:38:53] unprofitable for
[3:38:55] you one brother once said if your pastor
[3:38:59] is happy with
[3:39:00] you then God is happy with you but if
[3:39:04] your pastor is angry with you God is
[3:39:07] angry with
[3:39:09] you why he says submit
[3:39:12] yourselves to them that have the rule
[3:39:14] over
[3:39:16] why because they watch for your
[3:39:19] souls and they will give an
[3:39:22] account did you know pastors are going
[3:39:25] to give
[3:39:27] account to all those people that God
[3:39:29] brought into their
[3:39:30] [Music]
[3:39:32] hands now that shows you how should a
[3:39:36] pastor you know TW let me read this for
[3:39:39] you it says brother bam was explaining
[3:39:42] what Jack Mo told him one time
[3:39:48] and he said Jack Mo said to me one
[3:39:50] time I would to have to answer like like
[3:39:53] you will have two at the day of
[3:39:57] judgment said God has put these people
[3:40:00] into your
[3:40:01] hands and you're going to give an
[3:40:04] account for every one of
[3:40:08] them you are going to answer for your
[3:40:14] ministry praise praise the name of the
[3:40:16] Lord fathers parents you are going to
[3:40:20] answer for your
[3:40:23] children you're going to answer for your
[3:40:25] children you're going to give an
[3:40:27] account how you raised
[3:40:29] them husbands you are going to answer
[3:40:33] for your
[3:40:35] wives because she's a part of you the
[3:40:39] says you are the head and
[3:40:41] body like you know so you're going to
[3:40:44] answer for your wife
[3:40:47] and you know at one point he said these
[3:40:49] men who leave their
[3:40:52] wives to just go dress
[3:40:55] anyhow imag they leave their W to dress
[3:40:58] you know those mini SCS and
[3:41:02] those and they go on the
[3:41:04] road and they pollute our
[3:41:07] generation do you know it was wrong for
[3:41:10] a woman to dress a trouser
[3:41:15] how many knew that that was
[3:41:17] wrong it is wrong the Bible says a woman
[3:41:20] shall not wear that which pertain unto a
[3:41:24] man and one person told me one time no
[3:41:27] there is a trous of women and a trous of
[3:41:30] men and I and I also told them can you
[3:41:34] as a woman wearing a
[3:41:37] trouser go in a toilet which has
[3:41:40] a how do they call that thing sign
[3:41:46] and that which shows a
[3:41:48] man has limbs
[3:41:51] separated as a
[3:41:53] trouser and that of a woman it shows a
[3:41:57] scar so now you who is a woman wearing a
[3:42:01] trouser can you
[3:42:04] enter that place where you cannot even
[3:42:09] Common Sense will tell
[3:42:10] you that is a
[3:42:13] man but they have sin so far
[3:42:18] away that even their Common Sense cannot
[3:42:22] teach them
[3:42:24] that I have told you many
[3:42:26] times growing up not many years
[3:42:29] ago not many years ago I don't know how
[3:42:33] many here were part of
[3:42:36] that those who were part of that
[3:42:38] generation when women started wearing
[3:42:40] that
[3:42:42] trous you know we would go behind them
[3:42:45] and we small children some of us were
[3:42:48] not even wearing
[3:42:49] shirts and were
[3:42:54] clapping how many saw
[3:42:57] that some people they did in the
[3:43:01] societies until a girl would feel so
[3:43:03] sorry for she would have to go back and
[3:43:06] change
[3:43:07] it and put on a a skirt or a
[3:43:12] dress because the children have having
[3:43:15] been taught by
[3:43:17] nobody
[3:43:19] conscious told them that a woman doesn't
[3:43:22] dress like that but today they dress
[3:43:26] like that and they even come in church
[3:43:29] some of them are worship
[3:43:32] leaders and they come in the church and
[3:43:34] they begin throwing their around
[3:43:40] oh
[3:43:42] Jesus that is not the yes of the
[3:43:46] Bible the yes of the Bible is very
[3:43:50] orderly the yes of the Bible believes in
[3:43:54] women being
[3:43:57] decent
[3:43:58] decent men come out of the
[3:44:02] World when they are full of
[3:44:04] last they come in the church they go
[3:44:07] away moreful than they
[3:44:10] came why because of how women are
[3:44:14] dressed want to say thank God for this
[3:44:17] message that has given us
[3:44:20] sanity it has made our women cover their
[3:44:25] themselves hallelujah amen what told
[3:44:28] that the Holy Spirit you know they claim
[3:44:31] to have the Holy
[3:44:32] Spirit if you have the Holy Spirit he
[3:44:36] will teach you how to
[3:44:39] dress he teach you how to dress you
[3:44:42] remember that man who was in the tombs
[3:44:44] of GAD
[3:44:46] how he was
[3:44:47] naked what was wrong with him how many
[3:44:51] remember what was wrong with him he had
[3:44:53] demons in
[3:44:55] him demons make people
[3:44:59] [Music]
[3:45:01] naked not teaching
[3:45:04] demons it makes people
[3:45:07] naked and then this preachers who the
[3:45:10] Bible says they have become preachers of
[3:45:13] righteousness
[3:45:16] but they are not sent by God they tell
[3:45:18] them it is okay God doesn't care about
[3:45:22] your dresses he car about your soul what
[3:45:25] is in the inside of you will be showed
[3:45:29] on the
[3:45:31] outside and and this man was was naked
[3:45:36] but when Jesus
[3:45:37] came when Jesus come all the demons
[3:45:42] disappear the Bible says when he came he
[3:45:45] cast out those demons and as soon as
[3:45:48] they left the man started pulling
[3:45:52] clothes he said bring cloes shower him
[3:45:55] and dress him up hallelujah amen when
[3:45:59] you receive Jesus in your life you will
[3:46:02] shower you will you will you will remove
[3:46:05] all that kind of thing that the world
[3:46:07] has put on
[3:46:09] you and you will dress
[3:46:12] her and you will dress her
[3:46:15] you will dress
[3:46:17] up that is why when you look around all
[3:46:21] the churches of True
[3:46:25] Believers our precious
[3:46:28] sisters have
[3:46:30] showered make up away from their
[3:46:35] faces they have been cleaned up by the
[3:46:39] water of the
[3:46:41] world and they have dressed and covered
[3:46:43] their
[3:46:45] for the glory of
[3:46:47] God so men are
[3:46:50] responsible for their wives dressing
[3:46:52] like
[3:46:53] that the Bible says a man that shall
[3:46:55] look at a woman to last after
[3:46:59] her already
[3:47:01] committed just by
[3:47:03] seeing so she is and him
[3:47:10] both oh my but I thank God for this word
[3:47:13] friends because it has opened our
[3:47:17] eyes to see praise the name of the
[3:47:21] Lord and so the scripture would continue
[3:47:23] on I'll just skip a few things here and
[3:47:25] talk about
[3:47:27] wives the Bible speaks about in the book
[3:47:30] of Ephesians
[3:47:32] 5 wives submit yourselves unto your own
[3:47:35] [Music]
[3:47:36] husbands as unto the Lord for the
[3:47:40] husband is the head of the
[3:47:42] wife even as Christ is the head of the
[3:47:44] church
[3:47:46] and he is the savior of the
[3:47:48] body therefore as the church is subject
[3:47:51] unto
[3:47:52] Christ so let their wives
[3:47:55] be to their own
[3:47:57] husbands in
[3:48:01] everything now I want you to hear the
[3:48:03] the Amplified version it says wives be
[3:48:07] subject be
[3:48:10] submissive and adapt yourselves
[3:48:15] [Music]
[3:48:16] to your and adapt yourselves to your
[3:48:22] husbands as let it be as a
[3:48:26] service to the
[3:48:28] Lord for the husband is the head of the
[3:48:32] is the head of the
[3:48:33] wife as Christ is the head of the
[3:48:37] church himself the savior of his
[3:48:42] body as the church is subject to Christ
[3:48:46] so let wives also be in subjection in
[3:48:50] sorry let wives also be subject in
[3:48:52] everything to their
[3:48:56] husbands one one sister one time told
[3:48:59] me did you just saying
[3:49:02] everything and I also say it is not me
[3:49:04] that said
[3:49:05] it it is the Bible that said it let
[3:49:09] wives be subject in
[3:49:12] what oh that is so weak
[3:49:16] sisters in every
[3:49:19] word is that the
[3:49:22] Bible is that the Bible ask your
[3:49:25] neighbor is that the
[3:49:26] Bible that is the Bible in
[3:49:30] everything one time there came up a
[3:49:33] sister in in the
[3:49:38] meeting church
[3:49:40] service and spoke to brother and brother
[3:49:44] husband is a bad
[3:49:46] man is's not a
[3:49:48] Christian and he told me I should stop
[3:49:52] coming to the meeting the
[3:49:54] tacle what should I do if you're the
[3:49:57] pastor what you
[3:49:59] ADV sister go
[3:50:03] first but the prophet of God answered
[3:50:07] said sister
[3:50:08] dear honor your
[3:50:10] husband and respect
[3:50:13] him and submit
[3:50:16] you can be a better
[3:50:20] Christian at home than in the
[3:50:24] church stay where he wants you and be
[3:50:28] the best of a Christian that you
[3:50:31] know your
[3:50:34] life will present to him Jesus
[3:50:37] Christ your life and you know in a
[3:50:40] little time the man he began watching
[3:50:45] his
[3:50:46] wife began watching his wife and that
[3:50:51] life impacted his
[3:50:53] life and changed him and he gave his
[3:50:56] life to Jesus Christ and both of them
[3:51:00] started coming to
[3:51:02] church praise the name of the Lord so
[3:51:04] what is happening with our generation
[3:51:07] they will tell the women oh that one is
[3:51:10] a Believer leave
[3:51:11] him come and we will give you another
[3:51:14] one
[3:51:18] his brother his wife was
[3:51:23] disturbing and you have you have many
[3:51:25] cases like
[3:51:26] that you know the prophet gave me
[3:51:28] another husband me another
[3:51:30] wife when you make your vows
[3:51:34] whether whether you agree or disagree
[3:51:40] until praise the name of the Lord and
[3:51:43] what there a lot of
[3:51:46] wrangles is
[3:51:48] submission that you cannot find that you
[3:51:51] know uh the man doesn't know his
[3:51:54] place and the woman fails to understand
[3:51:56] her
[3:51:57] place but you see the power to
[3:52:01] submit comes from Grace or of being
[3:52:06] humble when you humble
[3:52:08] yourself then you can submit but if you
[3:52:11] can't H
[3:52:13] yourself subm is
[3:52:16] difficult I'm telling you the truth not
[3:52:19] only in marriage anywhere else
[3:52:22] submission without humility is
[3:52:26] impossible it is
[3:52:28] impossible why submit yourselves to your
[3:52:30] own
[3:52:31] husbands it is fit in the Lord husbands
[3:52:34] love your
[3:52:36] wives and be not
[3:52:40] bitter against
[3:52:42] them amen Brothers
[3:52:45] you find some men who are very
[3:52:48] bitter you know because you know the man
[3:52:50] is called a lion my children called me a
[3:52:52] lion at
[3:52:54] home because you think you are the
[3:52:57] king which of course you are and your
[3:53:00] wife is the queen so how can you now
[3:53:03] begin raising your voice and shouting at
[3:53:05] the queen even when the children are
[3:53:06] there
[3:53:11] watching I told you and all the children
[3:53:14] began
[3:53:17] be not bitter against
[3:53:19] them wives submit yourselves unto your
[3:53:22] own
[3:53:23] husband as unto the
[3:53:26] Lord and here in Brackets the Amplified
[3:53:28] says because he is your
[3:53:35] [Music]
[3:53:36] lord how many knows
[3:53:39] that that's right your husband is your
[3:53:42] lord
[3:53:50] sister this one is your
[3:53:52] lord if you disobey him and don't
[3:53:56] submit you have even if you pray your
[3:54:00] prayers are for
[3:54:02] n if you don't want to have another Lord
[3:54:05] apart from
[3:54:07] Jesus don't get
[3:54:09] married amen my sisters but if you want
[3:54:12] to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:54:15] and go to heaven and you get married
[3:54:18] then that is your first
[3:54:20] La by submitting to him you are
[3:54:24] submitting unto the Lord that's why
[3:54:26] before you
[3:54:28] accept you must make sure that is
[3:54:30] submittable
[3:54:34] to he himself has submitted himself to
[3:54:37] his
[3:54:39] Lord who is Jesus Christ
[3:54:45] praise the
[3:54:47] Lord I read for you a quote here from
[3:54:49] the message we would see
[3:54:53] Jesus I'm approaching to finish now says
[3:54:57] just like why does a woman every time
[3:54:59] she gets
[3:55:01] married on her
[3:55:08] face because she's coming to her husband
[3:55:15] just like Rebecca did she put a veil
[3:55:18] over her
[3:55:19] face to meet Isaac she has no more head
[3:55:24] ISAC is head and the church ought to be
[3:55:27] so submissive to the word of
[3:55:31] God that it veils the church WIll Veil
[3:55:35] its own
[3:55:37] face it has no more
[3:55:39] head the nature of a woman is to submit
[3:55:42] to a man
[3:55:45] and that's what the church ought to be
[3:55:47] doing
[3:55:48] also submitting to Christ to his word to
[3:55:52] his Doctrine to his principles she takes
[3:55:56] no thought for
[3:55:57] herself she has no head of
[3:56:00] herself Christ is her
[3:56:03] head not some exell doal church
[3:56:07] bch denomination kind of teachings but
[3:56:11] Christ is our head Christ the word
[3:56:14] and the Word was made flesh and DT Among
[3:56:18] Us Jesus Christ is the same yester
[3:56:22] forever that same manifestation of the
[3:56:27] word praise the name of the
[3:56:31] Lord my my
[3:56:34] my in the
[3:56:37] Amplified Jam says come close to
[3:56:42] God with a contrite heart
[3:56:45] and he will come close to
[3:56:47] you wash your
[3:56:49] hands you Sinners and purify your
[3:56:53] Unfaithful
[3:56:56] Hearts you double minded
[3:56:59] people be
[3:57:01] miserable grieve weep over your sin let
[3:57:05] your foolish laugh be turned to
[3:57:08] morning and your Reckless joy to
[3:57:11] groom humble yourself with an attitude
[3:57:14] of
[3:57:15] repentance and
[3:57:20] insignificance I tell you a story
[3:57:23] here brother bam one time you know we
[3:57:27] preach to Believers like
[3:57:28] this had a gift of healing so and also
[3:57:34] Visions so you see a vision maybe the
[3:57:36] angel of the Lord would come over
[3:57:39] somebody and then a vision will break
[3:57:42] out but when was in believer's
[3:57:45] churches it was very
[3:57:48] difficult because he would struggle with
[3:57:50] people have faith
[3:57:52] fa but when he went to South
[3:57:55] Africa many people who even were
[3:57:59] Catholics when he came and they came in
[3:58:02] the presence of
[3:58:03] God they began
[3:58:05] opening and the angel of the Lord
[3:58:08] moved impa it is in
[3:58:10] history Cars and Cars of CR
[3:58:16] whe
[3:58:17] chair people who were
[3:58:20] healed some of them were transported
[3:58:22] from
[3:58:24] hospitals but they were
[3:58:27] healed so Believers are self
[3:58:31] right but Catholics and many of those
[3:58:34] people who we think are not
[3:58:37] believers they are
[3:58:39] sincere God operates upon sincerity
[3:58:44] upon
[3:58:47] humility and I want to finish with this
[3:58:50] Ahab Ahab story here and show you how
[3:58:54] God was able to come down we know many
[3:58:57] of us we know Ahab as a man who was a
[3:59:00] bad person who was not a good
[3:59:04] believer but let me when I was reading I
[3:59:07] was actually
[3:59:08] amazed I want you to open your Bible to
[3:59:10] the book of First Kings 21
[3:59:15] verses
[3:59:16] 25 but there was none like unto Ahab
[3:59:19] which did sell himself to work
[3:59:21] wickedness in the sight of the Lord whom
[3:59:23] Jezebel his wife St
[3:59:26] up and he did very abominably in in
[3:59:31] following Idols according to all things
[3:59:33] as did as did the amorites whom the Lord
[3:59:36] cast out before the children of Israel
[3:59:38] you can begin reading from verse 25
[4:00:07] 2125 friends I'm closing with this I
[4:00:10] want you to pay
[4:00:12] attention I want you to see
[4:00:15] man who is a backslid
[4:00:20] Believer and married an
[4:00:24] unbeliever now the Bible says that Ahab
[4:00:28] sold
[4:00:30] himself to work
[4:00:34] wickedness in the sight of
[4:00:36] God and then not as if that was not
[4:00:41] enough jeel his wife
[4:00:44] an
[4:00:45] nonbeliever was starting up
[4:00:49] things so you have a man who backl and a
[4:00:54] woman who is an nonbeliever and starting
[4:00:59] up and he did now this is Ahab he did
[4:01:02] very abominably in in following
[4:01:08] Idols according to all things as did the
[4:01:12] amorites whom the Lord cast out before
[4:01:14] the children of
[4:01:16] Israel and it came to pass when Ahab had
[4:01:20] heard those
[4:01:22] words that he rent his clothes and put
[4:01:26] sa upon his
[4:01:27] flesh and
[4:01:30] fasted and lay in
[4:01:33] sackcloth and went
[4:01:36] softly when this man had the Judgment of
[4:01:40] God which was
[4:01:41] negative about his life
[4:01:44] what did he do he broke
[4:01:47] down I'm giving you a principle if there
[4:01:50] is anything you have been praying for
[4:01:52] wanting
[4:01:54] God and you're not receiving it maybe
[4:01:57] you are self
[4:01:58] rightous maybe you're
[4:02:01] proud and I'm giving you a principle
[4:02:04] breaking down in the presence of
[4:02:07] God this
[4:02:10] man no he was actually according to the
[4:02:13] scripture he was the worst
[4:02:17] sinner but when he heard the Judgment of
[4:02:20] God upon his
[4:02:22] life the Bible says he he fasted he put
[4:02:26] on
[4:02:27] sackcloth he rent his
[4:02:30] clothes you know he went softly he humed
[4:02:34] himself and the word of the Lord came to
[4:02:36] Elijah the ti by
[4:02:39] saying do you see how has humed himself
[4:02:43] before for
[4:02:47] me
[4:02:49] because he humbles himself before
[4:02:52] me that one
[4:02:55] word because he hum himself before me I
[4:02:59] will not bring evil in his
[4:03:02] days but you see the word of God had
[4:03:04] already gone
[4:03:07] forth and the kingdom you know was
[4:03:09] already divided and you know and God was
[4:03:13] already with this
[4:03:15] man but he told him because this
[4:03:18] man has humbled
[4:03:21] himself evil will not come in his
[4:03:24] days but I will bring it in in the
[4:03:27] future upon his
[4:03:30] house because the word of God does not
[4:03:33] fail once it has come
[4:03:35] out two things I want to finish with
[4:03:39] number one the children of
[4:03:41] Israel when God when they grieved God
[4:03:44] for being proud and for not humbling
[4:03:47] themselves to what Moses was telling
[4:03:49] them God became angry and he said Moses
[4:03:53] I'm going to kill all of them H Moses
[4:03:56] pleaded he said oh God what will the
[4:03:58] others think please forgive them now it
[4:04:01] appeared God had forgiven
[4:04:04] them but actually they all died in the
[4:04:09] [Music]
[4:04:10] desert all of them only two
[4:04:14] JHU
[4:04:15] and so still the word of God was
[4:04:18] accomplished so one thing I want you to
[4:04:20] learn today that before the wrath of God
[4:04:23] comes upon your
[4:04:26] life humble
[4:04:28] yourself let not God declare anything
[4:04:32] negative upon your
[4:04:34] life do not permit it to
[4:04:37] happen because if it happens okay and
[4:04:41] you humble yourself after that
[4:04:44] yes he will forgive you but you will
[4:04:46] suffer the
[4:04:47] consequences because the word that comes
[4:04:49] out of his mouth cannot return before it
[4:04:54] accomplishes
[4:04:56] what but number two this man humbled
[4:05:00] himself he said God have mercy he
[4:05:03] repented he he put on sack
[4:05:06] cloth he went softly before the
[4:05:10] Lord and God spoke this word because
[4:05:15] he has humbled
[4:05:16] himself because he has humbled himself
[4:05:21] because he has humbled himself now did
[4:05:24] you know humbling yourself will give you
[4:05:27] the favor of God in your
[4:05:32] life you may be the worst of
[4:05:36] Sinner but because you humble yourself
[4:05:39] in his
[4:05:40] presence that is all it takes for God to
[4:05:43] take from one level to another let us
[4:05:46] stand on our
[4:05:54] feet let us
[4:05:56] pray as the musicians
[4:06:08] come now I'd like to ask a
[4:06:12] question because the word of
[4:06:15] God does not return unto him
[4:06:20] void it accomplishes that which it has
[4:06:23] been sent to
[4:06:28] do maybe there is an
[4:06:31] area that you need to humble yourself
[4:06:34] in maybe you are a
[4:06:37] child and you need to humble
[4:06:40] yourself maybe you are a parent
[4:06:44] and you need to humble
[4:06:46] yourself before the
[4:06:48] Lord maybe you know you've been hearing
[4:06:51] the word many times you say well I've
[4:06:53] heard the word it's been talking about
[4:06:55] me it's been talking about me but your
[4:06:58] life doesn't
[4:06:59] change because you don't humble yourself
[4:07:02] to sincerely
[4:07:04] repent sincerely come before the Lord
[4:07:07] and make yourself right with
[4:07:09] him I wonder if we still have people who
[4:07:12] can break down in his presence
[4:07:16] and say Lord I'm wrong
[4:07:18] here I need help here I need you to help
[4:07:22] me on this
[4:07:23] area I need you to help me in this area
[4:07:27] that area maybe you are a
[4:07:29] wife and you need
[4:07:34] humility the way up is the way the Way
[4:07:36] Up Is
[4:07:39] Down you need to humble
[4:07:42] yourself order for the Holy Spirit to
[4:07:45] lift you God loves lifting The
[4:07:49] Humble that he specializes in that but
[4:07:52] he also brings down the proud in
[4:07:57] heart how many here maybe with all our
[4:08:00] heads
[4:08:02] bound we want to say
[4:08:05] Lord I've been proud here I've not been
[4:08:08] listening
[4:08:10] enough I need to humble myself
[4:08:14] forgive
[4:08:16] me help me to be a better man a better
[4:08:19] woman a better Christian a better
[4:08:24] believer I'd like to pray for you father
[4:08:27] in the name of our Lord Jesus
[4:08:29] Christ I'd like to thank you for your
[4:08:33] grace for your mercies which you have
[4:08:35] bestowed upon us today and for the
[4:08:38] people that have been under the sound of
[4:08:40] my
[4:08:41] voice these are words perhaps s
[4:08:44] that may sound like a
[4:08:48] rebuke but Lord you know for whom it has
[4:08:53] come and Lord if a child of God would
[4:08:56] hear the word of God they would desire
[4:08:58] to be like
[4:09:02] that I pray that you will help each one
[4:09:04] of
[4:09:05] us to H and submit
[4:09:08] ourself Before the Throne before the
[4:09:10] king of
[4:09:12] Lord Lord Jesus you know each one each
