Uh this is the sister that some many of you did not know. Stand there and face the people. Uh that this is the sister that you helped and thank you so much for helping. and um you know because you know she was taken advantage of by those cornmen and uh she was in jail for is it three nights, three days. So um and um it was quite unfortunate and she works for you know how do they call it micro finance micro finance but I had a conversation with her and I advised her to always stay away from free things or from hot deals that you are going to benefit from and you never labored for them. And I wanted to say that because some of you might also fall pregnant. And I heard that even sister Esther, where is sister Esther? Is she here this morning? Her employee suffered the same problem. How much was she duped? One point 1.2 I heard I I couldn't call you because I did not know what to tell you. I pray and and so um you you know if you want to consult sister Esther because this is her capital doing business with this money you know someone called a worker and as if they were sent by sister [Music] Esther when Esther was here and by the time that she realized she was being cheated all the money was finished and they wanted more. So friends, we should be on the lookout. We the world we are living in. People are not good. It is only Jesus Christ who makes us good. So thank you for standing with this sister. She was in jail because of your help and she was able to leave the jail. And um sister we still have I don't remember how much but after the service you should see the treasurers so that they can hand over that. Amen. And um also sister Baka made me understand that she traveled to Karamoja because she still has a leave call it the maternal maternal And so she she figured she could use the time also go and be with her husband for a wedding. She told me one or two weeks, but she sent her greetings. Amen. Uh lastly, I also want to appreciate brother Martin and and the other ministers uh standing with him on Sunday. and also thank you for praying for us. We had a successful trip in Kenya um in the convention there in Kaos um with the brother Keith Raid from Jamaica. He preached about I think about three or two meetings and I took one and uh then we traveled back on on the Monday morning. Pastor and the believers in Kenya, Pastor Kith also was here in an interview. We had an interview with him on the bench. So if you missed it out, I'd like to encourage you to go and listen, especially especially the the youth. He had quite a lot of outstanding things to say. I mean, he's someone who is a pastor, full-time pastor, um, missionaries, travel all over the world. Um, you know, he is a businessman as well as he's a he works for a multinational [Music] company, but also he's a lecturer. He has a wealth of knowledge and information. So in my interaction with him as we were coming from Kenya we needed to um give that information to the to the youth. So please go and listen to it on the YouTube. It will be a blessing to you. Amen. Um shall we stand on our feet and we can now read the word. Thank you musicians. That's what we're singing for now. We are reading out of the book of Luke chapter 2. Uh when we are packed like this, sometimes there can be warmth and if you're not careful, you may find yourself dozing. So be on the lookout for sleep and uh if you see your neighbor sleeping as you tap on them especially those who have breakfast in the morning sleep can come easily. So make make sure you don't do praise God. Luke chapter 2 8 we are reading um up to verses 20 so I'm going to read in English and then when we see it the brother will read in and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord shone around about them and they were so afraid And the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David, as a savior, which is a savior rather, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you, ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger." And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the of the heavenly host praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest and on the earth, peace, good will toward men." And it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let us now go even unto um unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord has made known unto us." And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and a babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, and made known up and um they made known abroad the saying which was told them according uh concerning this child. And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart. And the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them. Let us first pray. Our loving Jesus, once again we come before you. I thank you for the people, the visitors visiting today for their first time, those coming again and the those who attend church here. Lord, we know also there are others streaming perhaps from many uh countries away long distances. Father, you know each heart. You know each need. Lord, I pray that you will use me today as a best uh unto your to minister to your children according to their needs. There's nothing good. I have no abilities within myself. But if you can help me Lord, I I know that you your children will be blessed. Father, we commit this service into Lord in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Please be seated. As the brother reads in Luganda, Fore speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. [Music] [Music] Juru Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. [Music] [Music] Amen. God bless you. Now, uh this text we have read today, we usually read it on days like maybe Christmas. But uh you see our Christmas is not a day our Christmas is the birth of Christ. And we believe he was not only born 2,000 years ago. We believe he's born today in our hearts. When you receive the Holy Spirit, you have received he is born in your heart. So, we are not really worshiping a Jesus that was here 2,000 years ago. We are worshiping a Jesus that is here today in our ministry. The Bible says in Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. So, if he was born then, he's born today. So, this is also appropriate today. And also when we talk about Easter, the resurrection, he's resurrected, not 2,000 years ago. Is resurrected today. So what I'm trying to say is the gospel we are preaching is a gospel of today. We are preaching the the gospel of the now because our God is the God of the now. So if you have a problem now, he is going to address your problem now because he brings spiritual food inducing. And I'm speaking on a subject deity tabernacled in man. Amen. So now the whole story started in heaven and then onto the garden. And you will know why I read this scripture. Stay with me. And please to avoid sleeping, keep saying amen to the word. Amen. The devil thought he had he would defeat God. And you know how he he wanted to ascend to the to the above the stars of God. He thought he would defeat God. But you know God cannot be defeated because he is the master strategy. God has seen the [Music] end right from the beginning. That is generally but also that is also about your life. God has seen your end right at the beginning. And where was the beginning? He is the beginning. So where were you before the beginning? You were in him before the beginning. And God saw you in him before the beginning. So he knows how you will end. He knows how you will end. We are not here living you know waiting just to see what will happen to us. We know what will happen to us. We know what is happening to us. We know where we are going because we know where we came from. I will tell you where I came from. I came from God. I go back to God. Amen. And I know where I am going. So I am not living in the world by mistake. I was not born by mistake. I was not born of the will of man. But I was born of the will of God. The Bible says man born of a woman is of a few days full of trouble. But I'm not born by a woman. I am not born by a woman. My body was not. Who am I? I am on the inside. I am I'm a soul. I'm a soul. Amen. And I was not born by a woman. I came in this body after it was born. I was with God from the foundation of God and that's where I am going. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. We should stop seeing things the way we see. It is beyond what you see. Amen. Amen. And so the devil thought he would defeat God. But God is a master strategy. You know, you always sees the end from the beginning. He had it all planned out. God has your life planned. There is actually, let me tell you this. There is nothing going wrong with you. Even when you think things are going, there is nothing going wrong. That's why we are believers. We believe in what the word says. We don't believe in what our situations are saying. We don't believe in what our friends are saying. We don't even believe in what we are feeling. Don't even believe in what has happened to us. That does not define us. Your feelings don't define you. Your circumstances don't define you. You may be jobless right now, but that doesn't define you. You may have lost a scholarship, but that doesn't define you. You don't know how you're going to eat food after church is over. You may not even have tr. I want you to see beyond you. I want you to know you have a say. I want you to know you have a redeemer. I want you to know you are defined by the word. The word defiles me. If you want to see my birth certificate. It is right here. This tells my father. It tells where I came from. I am not of this world. I come from God. I go back to God. And you know what? This is exactly what Jesus was. And when he said it, they didn't understand it. He looked at them. They knew he was born in a manger. They knew he was born without a father. They knew he was an illegitimate child. But he looked at them and he told them, "I come from God. I go back to God." Jesus saw beyond his circumstances. They knew he was a carpenter. His father is a carpenter. But when he opened his mouth to speak, he did not claim he was a father. He was a son of a carpenter. He actually said to Joseph and Mary. When they came saying, "Oh, we were looking for me and your father. We were looking for Jesus turned." And he said, "What? Don't you know I'm supposed to be about my father's business? Your father is not Sagico. Your father is not Henry. Your father is not Are you getting the point? Your father Who is your father? What's your tribe? That's the problem we have. We see things according to our birth, natural birth. But there is another spiritual birth. I don't want you to see things in the as according to the order of the natural birth. Because if you look at it that way, then you will be defeated before you even start. Many things about our natural birth are disgusting. the way we were born, the parents that b us right now I've had recently we've been having issues in our home. Even my uncle is here been assisting us and my mother is here and we've been going back there to try and help and you know uh issues in my family. My father having many other women and trying to you know but this was a priest a preacher of the gospel but you know he backsle I do not know what seed is in him but if it is a seed gene of God all those things will not matter that's what I'm trying to say but according to the natural birth if I look at myself as a son of my father the next thing I will say I am I better than my fathers then you also get other women just like my Am I better than them? You get the point? That's my natural birth. So if you want to know my history according to my natural birth, some of it is disgusting, so is yours. Even if you were born by a man and a woman who were married and in a good home, that does not mean anything. Why? Because you were born in sin. You are come to the world speaking lies. So everything about our natural birth is not pleasing, is not exciting because it is not promising anything. But the grave, that's the only thing it is promising. Born to die, be buried. and the person who was born. That's why clans and families and you know tribes some of them you find they have graveyards and they say this is where they bury those who came out of so and so. That's why when you die they will take you and bury you there. I'm talking about you. If you die in this flesh they will take you and bury you there. I hope I don't get get to ever bury any of you. But sometimes even when a sister or brother dies, the clan members may refuse the preacher who was preaching to him to come and marry them. No, for us here in our clan, we are Catholics. We are Anglicans. We are Mormons. So we have the way we do our own things. We don't know you. You see, we have claimed what belongs to them, the flesh. But where are you? You are not in that flesh. You are not even going to be buried in that land. Amen. Amen. A believer has their owner. Hallelujah. Amen. when all the Old Testament saints died from Abraham, even Job himself, you know, from right from Job, Abraham and all those patriots. They were buried in one place and that was called they all even even Joseph whose bones were in Egypt, it made them promise Promise me my children when I die. You will carry my bones. I will take them back and bury me at Mel. You remember it was Abraham that actually bought that piece of land. And he he he wanted they wanted to give it for him to him for free. He said, "No, I will buy it. I will because my God is rich." The place where they were buried was bought, was paid for by their great great great grandfather, the one who had the confidence called Abraham. Are you following me? But now we see that is the Old Testament. These things happen physically. But to the church, the gentile church, we all have a we have a place where we can be buried where all believers doesn't matter your doesn't matter your class. It doesn't matter your national origin. When you die, you are buried there. And when you when you die, you when you die, you die when you reject the word. You die when you accept Jesus Christ. And you are born again, not of flesh, and you're born again of the spirit. That which is born of flesh is flesh. And that which is born of spirit is Jesus told Nicodemus, not said unto you, you must be born again. Tell your neighbor, you must be born again. when you are born again in Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. Okay. Now, I did not plan to read this, but for a good foundation, let us read it. Romans quickly. Go to Romans. Praise the name of the Lord. Chapter 6. You will see it right there. Okay, listen. Know ye not vers three. Know ye not that so many of us as we are baptized into Jesus Christ, we are baptized into his death. Therefore, we are buried with him baptism into death. that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father, even so we also should walk in the newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection. Amen. Where is our old man that was born by nature? The old man was crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin. If we we be dead with Christ, we believe also we shall live with him. Praise in the name of the Lord, knowing that Christ being raised from the dead no more. Death has no more dominion over him. Amen. Amen. That's why someone who is born again, they cannot die. I cannot die. Amen. Amen. I shall live to declare the the praises and the goodness of the Lord in the life of the living. Amen. If we are born again, we cannot die. You see me here the way you are seeing me here. I cannot be killed. And I'm not the only one. You too. You cannot be. The Bible says fear him. Don't fear him who can kill the flesh but can't touch your soul. Fear him who can kill both your flesh and destroy your soul. What will you give for your soul if you live in this world and you don't care about the word? Your soul will be destroyed. But if you live in this world and you make the word the most important thing in your life, you will never die. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. And so that's our true origin. I came from God. I go back to God. God had my life planned out. The devil thought he had won. But God had everything planned. All right. I want us to look at the I want to paint a picture for you. The devil had a plan. But you see the devil cannot have one plan because the devil will always change ideas because he doesn't know what will work and what may fail. But God is God. His plan is the only plan and it will always work. So the plan he has for your life is the only plan. Now let me tell you the blood he had for your life before you were born the same blood he had there is nothing going to happen. You will make God say let me change the plan because this has failed which means you will fail. Many times you will be disappointed many times. But God has never been disappointed. God has never failed. Because the plan he had been given concerning my life, concerning your life is the same plan he had. Amen. Sometimes you feel like you are spiritual. Sometimes you feel you're very calm. Sometimes you feel like singing. Sometimes you feel like sometimes things are good, sometimes things are bad and then you say, "I have changed. I think the way I was doing this is not right. Let me change it." Then you'll go seek for counsel pastor what do you think mommy? What do you think? Adise me here because I'm doing like this but things didn't work out. Don't you think you have I been doing this wrong and then you will go change it. That's us human beings. But that's not God. God thought the very first thing he thought and he spoke cannot be changed. The word of God is forever in heaven. Now can I preach to you brothers? God has a word concerning you. You remember the time you when you first believe. You remember the enthusiasm you had the faith you had and what you believed God can do in your life. God never changed his mind. You have felt many times as if God changed his mind. But God never changed his mind. Even if you feel different. By the way, you have to understand the gospel and faith. It's not about how you feel. It is quite absurd. How many you know in our generation have turned and reduced the gospel down to [Music] feelings. Now I believe in emotions get my point properly and get the best words to use. Listen listen are you listening church. The the gospel of Jesus Christ is not about how you feel. It is beyond how you feel. That's why we are [Music] believers. It's not about how we feel. Sometimes you will feel like a believer. Sometimes you will feel like an unbeliever. But if you are a believer, it doesn't matter what you feel because God is first opinion perfect about. And that opinion does not change. Okay, let me first come to your level right now. Your address. Let me tell you this. If you don't, if you want to understand this, ask yourself, how many of you since you believed Jesus Christ have lived spotless lives? No hand. So you have all lived a messed up. I thought when you believe Jesus, old things are passable. All things have become new. You are supposed to be spotless. That's not what it is. You're going to have a lot of spots, a lot of falling, a lot of rising, but throughout the entire process. God is mine about your life and do not change. Amen. Now that is why it is important for a believer to know what God says about him. That is why when you realize who you are, you when you get a revelation of who you are, Never fail. No amount of demons can destroy your life. Things will come and things will your feet will remain on the word of God. You will sing a song. I shall not be moved. Just like a tree planted by the [Applause] river, I shall not be moved. Satan had many plans when he was coming down to the human race. He said, "I will ascend above the stars and I'll become God." That was Sony's plan. Plan A. And he says, "If this fails, I will go down and take over the human race." That was his plan B. He says, "If I can't take over the human race, I will confuse the human race, I will rule over them." That was plan C. And plan B was if I cannot rule over them. I will steal from them. I will kill them and I will destroy the earth. Satan has had all this planned out. But you see, God always also has a plan. That's why in the book of Genesis, he created the the land, the sea, the fish, the things in the in the in the garden, and then he created man. He created the waters and then he created the fish. God always plans things before he does. God had a plan. I want you to turn to the book of Genesis, chapter 3, vers 15. I want you to see the plan of God. And I will put an enemy between thee and a woman, between thy seed and her seed. It shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his [Music] heel. Now friends, let me say this slowly. Many do not understand. Listen, listen. Many do not understand what happened in Genesis. And I want to just spend a moment to rehearse a little bit for you. Many people don't have the understanding of what happened in Genesis. They think that Adam ate an apple. And you know, but says something. It says if Eve ate an apple and she realized she was naked, then they should pass apples to the women of this generation so that they can dress. Many of them are walking half naked. So we should pass apples to them and then they realize they need it because if the apple could do that day do it today. But you have to understand it was not apple. What did they do? God told them of all the trees you can eat but of this tree the tree of knowledge of good and evil that you should not eat. But you see what Eve did. He added on the word when the serpent came. This serpent was a crawling creature. We think it was a crawling creature. But it was not a crawling creature. You're a good interpreter. It was not a crawling creature. It was an upright m. believers who have the revelation for this say amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Brother Shalom, can you please come up here? You see, God bless you, brother Shalom. See how handsome he looks. That's how the serpent looks. It is funny, but I'm not abusing you, brother, because it was a creature of God. It's not only him. Even you, it looked like all of us with hands, feet, with a stomach, with a back, with a head, with a mouth. The Bible even says she was eating and talking. Does a snake talk? It was talking. But then when it began talking to Eve, did God say eat of every tree? Eve said yes. God said we eat of every tree. He says we should not eat of the okay rather she said that God said we should not eat of of only the tree that is in the middle of the garden and we should not even touch it. So when she added on the word we should not touch it the serpent was happy. It was not the serpent by the way. This serpent was a creature which looked like a human being which could talk which could reason. The difference between the this creature and man was he did not have a soul. But man had a sword. That's the only difference. But this serpent also had a seed. In fact, it was not a snake. He called it a beast. It had a seed. Just like a man has a seat. Can I have one of my children run up here? Any come up. Come up. run right quick. Come and preach with me this morning. Oh, I saw you singing in Lugana. That was beautiful. Amen. This is my seed. I have a seed and this is the fruit. My seed. You get a point. I'm trying to say it in out in a better way for you to understand without cuz we are in mixed congregation here. So now the serpent also that seed was in me but now it is manifest but this serpent also had se that seed if mixed with with a w with a woman's egg or seed could bring forth child that is the ability that only beast. No other animal in the garden had that ability. Serpent is only a word used to mean the evil one, the devil. So he the cunning one. And the Bible says this serpent was very cunning, very subtle. It was the wisest of all the other beasts. And now the Bible says, you know, uh it was a beast, not a snake. I wish I had time read all all but right here in the book of Genesis. So you see here The red dragon was cast out. That old serpent called the devil and Satan deceiveth the whole world and was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast. Follow me closely. Follow me now. In the book of Ezekiel, I believe it is where he says, "Thou has been in Eden. the garden of God. And then he begins describing the devil, how he was in the garden of angels, how he was created by God, how he was an angel. So we notice here, and let me say this, I'm trying to say this slowly because understand what I'm saying. So there is a connection between the serpent in heaven and the serpent on earth. Are you following me? Are you following me? The word serpent is not necessarily meaning [Music] snake. All right. Okay. Right. Right over there. Thank you, brother. So see here in Ezekiel that has been in the garden everyone was [Music] diamond and gold the workmanship of thy tablets and of thy pipes that thou was clean. So he could sing. He could sing. beautiful voice. He was created. He was in the garden of God. Verse 14. You have verse 14. Ah, praise the name of the Lord. Thou art at the anointed cherub that coverth. And I have set thee so thou was upon the holy mountain. th has walked up and down in the midst of the So he was in but also he was in heaven. He's a carob. So who is he talking about here? And he calls him serpent in revelation. He's talking about Satan. He's talking about Satan as a serpent. He was an angel. He was a singer. He was a head musician. He's talking about Lucifer. Somewhere else he gives his name. He says Lucifer. [Music] He he was in heaven. His name was Lucifer. But he came down. He was cast out from heaven because of trying to lift himself above the stars of God. And he came down on earth in the Garden of Eden. Now, can you still help me, brother? Thank you. Now when he came down in the garden of there was this brother also called serpent. But this was not the devil. This was a creature in the garden of Eden looking like this man but having no problem like a chimpanzeee has no problem. is a creature of God. So was this beast or but this beast was the closest to the human race. Everything same. The only difference was it never had a soul. And then what happened when the old serpent came? He always loves beautiful things. That's why when those demons enter into people, they try to beautify themselves more than what God meant. Now, I'm not saying we should look ugly, but we can naturally look beautiful. You see when they when an evil spirit come they try they they try to tell you guys are not beautiful them make them look long I don't even know how they do they work and then you find a woman her nails are painted the devil is really giving them a lot of trouble And then on top of that you tell them even your lips are ugly. Paint them paint even these ears. They are not supposed to be like that. put something on them and the devil puts them on a burden and they will continue on even your face, even your eyes, even your nose and you know the devil will change them until recently. whom a man shoot a man a woman for lying to him because they went and had a wedding after they came out in the morning of their honeymoon day. The man saw somebody in bed and wanted to run away. What is this dear? I'm the one. You are not the one. I mean hair change, nails change, eyes change, mouth removed, nose, it was also fake, everything was fake, plastic surgery. Is the devil making them suffer? Says you're fearful and wonderful man. do not desire to get those add-ons. You can look beautiful naturally. If you're naturally dark skin, brother, sister, that's beautiful in the sight of by the way if you are dark and you make yourself brown or whatever, you will look ugly. Hallelujah. Patience stand up. patience naturally dark. Look at her. Turn to the people. I'm sorry for putting you. I'm sorry. But she's not beautiful. You find a girl like this. God bless you. See, the devil deceiving. But we thank God for this. He has given us eyes to see. There are still people in this world who are happy the way God made her. Amen. Amen. If you're a black woman, you're a black woman, a black man for God, if you're short, if you're tall, brother, that's all right. That's how God. But we see this beast was there. It was beautiful. And then the devil saw that he saw the intellect in her that this one will help me accomplish my goal. And you remember Satan was a spirit. So he came. Don't tell me that's not true. We have seen it in the Bible. The devil has done it before. He did it at at Gada. He entered into pigs. It is something he has specialized in doing. Even today we always cast out demons. How do they enter them? Have you ever asked yourself how do demons enter human being? Because they forced themselves. They forced themselves there. You know, as long as the p they get a place, the Bible says when demons are cast out of a man, They go in dry places but you see they keep coming back to shape. How is my house? If it's empty, sorry, but stay in. If the house is empty, then they will come in and they will call their brothers and sisters. So you find a person more demon possessed than they were before they left church. They are in church and they are bad bad but not bad but very bad and when they backslide the demons you will find they are worse because the demons will come and bring their grandchildren and they will enter them. But you see the devil enters people the army of the Lord is commissioned to cast out devil Amen. And the best way I know that casts out demons is the word. Yes, sir. And so there was Mr. Serpent. A good creature in the garden. I don't know what it was doing. Then a serpent from heaven came into it. M what's happening? I'm seeing things different then started walking then you can go back my because you a son of God you're not a serpent then you see began walking and she looks different she looks different she's Beautiful. How come I've never seen her like that? What is it? Something entered into it is the eyes of a serpent but they influence the body of a serpent but is influenced. The mouth of a serpent but is influent. One time a demon entered Peter and Peter started speaking to Jesus, discouraging him to die. Jesus realized this is not Peter, it's a demon. He went out and now here it has entered this beast and no one was there to cast it out. When it came to Eve, Eve cooperated and the moment she accepted the devil proposed that was the sin. Understand me correctly. The original sin unbelief. When God gave the word, Adam believed it. Adam gave it to you. But when the woman heard the serpent of this word, then she believed the serpent. That was the sin. That was the original sin. Follow me close. You have to understand this part because it will it will open up the whole thing. You have to understand that when that happened, he believed the serpent. But the serpent was not on its own. The devil was in this house. I want you to remember. This was a tree of knowledge, good and evil. It was not a a physical tree. He was talking about the devil. And when the woman was hearing, she was eating of the tree and she accepted to take the fruit of it. Praise the name of the Lord. Oh, this is figurative [Applause] language. But what does it mean? You know, she accepted to partake of the truth by believing the false doctrine and she ended up in a doubt. Now that part is what the theologians don't understand. I had a prophet who has come and told me actually saw what happened in the garden of Eden. You tell me how possible who wrote the book of who that was there. Brother Emma can you imagine In the beginning, God who was there to tell us everything how he said, "Who was there?" It had to be a prophet and it was Moses. Moses saw what was there. He wasn't there, but he saw it and wrote it down. So William, he goes back to the same place in the same way Moses went there. He saw details of actually what happened and he came back and he explained how the serpent walked over to Eve and he explains it was not a snake. It was an upperate creature. How is he able to explain? He saw it. This the same man who was able to tell people their names, their address, what is wrong with them? What is the inside of them without even knowing? By what ability? Prophetic sight. And so you saw the thing. And he comes back and he says, "So the serpent had a seed, and the seed mingled with the seed of a woman. And then there comes out a child. And the child is cave." And then after he says that, everybody shocked how possible. You take your Bible, you will see it is a Bible doctrine. The Bible says Enoch was the seventh from Adam. And when you count is not there because he died. says replaced from Adam. It goes straight to stress and yet Cain lives and Kane had children. So tell me what happened why is Cain not in the genealogy because never a son of Adam. And in the book of first John, the Bible say love one another and it says not as not as Cain. Who was of that wicked one? Kane was of who? Of that wicked one. Kane was a son of the wicked one. Who is the wicked one? The wicked one was Satan. Now after sin happened, the devil thought he will corrupt mankind. The devil thought he will corrupt the human race. So when God came down, he said, "What have you done?" And Adam said, "It's not me. It's the woman you and the woman said, it's not me, it's the serpent." Now, I want you to see here now. Can you open your eyes? When God when a woman says the serpent, God turns the serpent, he doesn't even ask the serpent because animals do not have power over choice. That animal could not stop the serpent coming. But nevertheless, because of this serpent, God had to destroy it, all these abilities for it never to happen again. And he said, "Because of what you have done, you will crown on your belly." That was not the case before. you will eat the dust which means it was not eating the dust at all. So you see now and then eventually he goes on to to to to the woman I said because of what you have done in pain you'll bring forth and that is the same thing today and the serpent still crawling ring the snake it was not in the original creation [Music] It came as a result of cast. Isn't it amazing? But I want you to see here because you have done this. He is speaking to the to the to the um serpent. You are cast above all. You are cast above every beast of the field. Upon thy belly thou shalt thou shalt go, and thou shalt thou eat all the days of thy and I will put enity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed. So the serpent had a seed and God said, I'll put a limit between your seed and her seed. So the woman also would have a seat. What is this woman's seed? Are you following me, church? What is a woman seed? Anybody knows what a woman is? The woman's seed would be a child that is born without a [Music] man born by a woman. That is only one in the whole world that has ever been born without a man born by a woman and that is Jesus. So Jesus is the woman's seed. Now right here in the beginning, in the beginning of all things, God had a plan. God prophesied that a woman will have a seat. So that was sometimes when God speaks words. You think they are idol. You think they have no power. Let me tell you church, the word of God has power. Even now as I'm speaking, even now as I'm speaking, you may not feel it. Something I am I know and I'm sure something is being created. Why? Because the word of God has power. When God said there will be a woman in he was talking about his plan. His plan was a perfect even as God is perfect and he therefore has a winning plan also. No angel knew the plan. No man knew the plan. Can I say his plan was a top secret plan that God himself would be according to man. to uproot and to destroy the seed of Satan. Hallelujah. The devil thought he had won and he seed come into the human race. By the way, after the flood, we cannot know which race is certainly seed. Everything was mixed up. So we cannot know but we can know by one way the seed of God believe the word the seed of never believe that's why God himself had to come as the word whoever believes in him the seed of God whoever does not believe in him the seed Am I preaching to someone this morning? And then Jesus stood before the disciples. And the Pharisees and he told the Pharisees, "You are of your father, the devil." How can you call us of our we descendants of the Abraham was our father? He said, "No, if he was, he would have believed me. And because you have rejected me, your father is the devil. Even today, I can say if you know the word, reject the word, God is not your father. Go and look for your father. But I am preaching to a people here that know that God is their father. They love the word of God. They live the word. in the church any more than anything more than a boyfriend. God is more than anything. That means God is your father and you say God is my father. Hallelujah. So God had a plan to ruin the seed of s And his plan was alpha and omega plan. You know God is amazing. So his plan was alpha and omega plan. Alpha omega plan top secret. When the angel saw the devil attacking, people have asked this question many times. If God is loving when he saw Satan going to attack, why didn't he quickly and stop Satan? Do you have the same question? He didn't have to because he had a plan. Sometimes his plan things look like they are failing. If you are in a situation which looks like things are failing, God has a plan. Hallelujah. Because he likes to surprise the devil. If he works on you very quickly before things go bad, where will he get the glory from? But he wants your enemies. Let them talk. After they have spoken, he has the final word. Yes sir. Hallelujah. Amen. When when you know Job was in a situation crying and everything friends came and I began talking to you. Oh, you are a sinner. Maybe you s are you sure you have been living right? But you know in all the situation cried, Job pray to God. Job even was angered and he asked God why you he went through it all and then after all had spoken then prophet Hallelujah. Amen. Prophet came he said my friends you are all you have all spoken your words can you also permit me to speak for I am here to speak for God preachers speak on behalf of God when you believe them you're believing God and when he spoke his word was the final God has the final word. I don't want you to look at your situations. God has the final word. His plan alpha and omega means beginning and end. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. He was right there at your beginning and he's going to be right there at your end. You know, he says to you, he says to me, "Trust me. I've got [Music] this. He has a plan. Tell your neighbor, God has a plan." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And you know, they must have wanted to go, all the angels, let me go and save the day. Oh God, let me go. But God had a plan. And he told all the angels, all of you angels, step aside. Amen. Step aside. And you know those moments when it looks like Satan is winning. Amen. You know, you feel like Satan is winning all the angels. You can't feel them. You can't feel the presence of I want to say to you today has a plan. Amen. Amen. God's plan is always a win. Hold my brother. Hold. Stand still. I want to say stand still because we serve a living God. God who never fail. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Praise God. A God who never fails. He has a plan for my life. Run for your life. You want to buy a house. You want to go to school. He has a plan. You want to get married. He has a plan. He has a plan. Winning. If you trust him, he cannot disappoint. Let us learn to trust in him. Stand still and see the salvation of our Lord. Amen. All angels stopped them. He said wait was like baby go sweep the devil with floods says wait you know me whatever you send me to do I do say oh master let me send the good news and tell Adam and Eve you are coming down said no with a surprise visit I want to make. Amen. Alpha and Omega plan. Then we find when God found them standing behind a bush somewhere shivering with their fig leaves approns on. They always try to get to Geneva and have a citizen people try and have a conference to make you know something inspiring. So also God wanted to have a conference with his people make certain places and they call a conference together. But I guess God found Adam and Eve behind a bush over there. They couldn't come out. They said, "We can't come out, father. We are naked." And who told you you were naked? God looked around and he found a tree, a certain place, a place he thought would be beautiful. And he got some skins and he threw them back in the bushes. And he said, "Adam, if cover yourselves with this, come out before me." And they had a conference. They talked it over with God. God made a preparation for and I'm so glad there was an aiden conference because there was an is a conference today. Not let us go under the fig leaves and something we can show up [Applause] together. But God killed something to cover their sin. And he gave a promise that through the woman is seash telling what he himself would do for them. I'm so glad of the Aiden conference. He made a way of a way to he could come back again. be brought back into fellowship where he would lo be lost and standing out somewhere and done without God. He made a preparation at the Eden conference temporality until the real preparation would be given through the sacrificial. He spoke that it would do that. But between that time the lamb had to die until the time until the lamp. Now now listen when he came down he gave them courts of skin. That was a preparation for the what? The work he will do to the sacrificial lamb blood of him of himself. But between that time and the time he would fulfill the real thing, he told them that they should be killing the lambs and then until that time that God himself would come and breathe the serpent his head and his he will be bruised at Calvary. And that conference was success. It will beat Satan anywhere. God is what. Jesus was God's word. And he will beat Satan in any condition, any time, any place, [Music] anywhere. Friends, I want you to listen to this prayer. Amen. You know when you're reading a wheel, it's like I'm reading a wheel now. Eden was only a type of a greater. The devil must have laughed at what happened. He didn't know this was just the beginning to think that God would just kill some sheep and clothe Adam. This looks stupid to the devil must have sat there and was like, "Ah, That's the best you can do. Does he know what I've done? I've planted my seed in there. He doesn't know. It's all right. I've planted my seed in there. And the best he can do is to dress them with some bloody ship skin. Wait until my plan manifest. What was the devil seeing? He was seeing his seed killing the seed of God. Pain killing. Did God know? God knew. Did God do anything? No. Apparently, but God had a plan. So the devil was shaking his head. I know. Wait until my son grows. And this woman had twins. in the same womb. One son of Adam, one son of the son and gave birth to them both on the same day. Kane and Abel was not was a son of God. Kane was a son of God. He was Rudy. He he was a bushman. He did not have any mercy. He went to his brother, quizzed his man because God rejected his calling. His offering was without revelation. Kane offered, you know what? Kane offered apples. Because he thought God, you know, his father and mother, they ate apples. So he offered apples. God refused it. But Abel knew by revelation it was blood offered a lamb a blood lamb. The true church will have the true revelation. Hallelujah. Amen. And so right there in Aiden we see it was just the beginning. The devil thought he had won. It looked stupid what God had done. But someone right there should have told the devil. Satan, it's just the beginning. It's just the beginning. When you feel you are defeated, you need to learn to man up and say, "It's just the beginning." When you're bleeding, when you are in a serious issue, you tell Satan just the beginning. God is really already doing something in my life. Brother Julius, tell Satan, it's just the beginning. I've not lost anything. It's just the beginning. It's just the beginning. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How many here are going through something? Tell the devil it's just the beginning. Sister, that's what you can tell him. It's just the beginning. But many times we begin crying. [Applause] God doesn't like people who cry out of fear. Moses came and was crying. Oh, God. God told him, "Stop it. Become Hallelujah. There is something I'm trying to get you. Is in you. He doesn't expect you to cry. He expects you to speak when things not to speak when things are good, but speak when things are going south. Speak when your back is against the wall. I want you to know is just the beginning. God is already doing something. Every condition must bow. It doesn't matter what is poverty, sickness. Every body condition sometimes. Let me tell you, brother. Even when sin hits you down, learn to resist. You young men, learn to resist. until the devil he sees you and you see it that you are going and you're down to see what I'm going to do because you know who you are. You know who you are. You know who you are. Nothing puts you down. Yes, sir. Now, the plan was getting ready to be executed. Hallelujah. Amen. We are now about to land. We have been building. Now, I want us to land. God had a plan. And we've known the plan. It's a bit mysterious. But the plan is about to be executed. It ends up with you. By the way, Luke 1 verse 28. How many years after? I don't know. Thousands of years. And the angel came in unto her and said, "Hail, thou that highly favored The Lord is with thee. [Music] Blessed art thou among women. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Okay. In Eden, God did not send an angel. But now he's sending an angel. Thousands of years later, Satan is almost controlling the world. And Satan thinks he's the is the Lord. You remember when he told Jesus, "The word belongs to me. Just bow to me and I give it to you." He thought he was there. I want to say Jesus is Lord. Southern is not Lord. Jesus is Lord. But thousands of years later, when it was time for God to now execute this plan, who was the first to know? Mary. Miam. Who was the first to hear? Mary. Who was the first to know that the plan was being destroyed? Eve. Who was the first to know that about God's plan? Mary. Fear women. Women are a blessing. A man there sentiment I'm going to say right here a man without a woman cannot it let me put it this way it will be very difficult for him to realize his true godgiven ambition and execute all of them but when a man has a woman in his life. I'm not talking about a prostitute, a wayward woman. I'm talking about a woman of virtue. You realize that men tend to be clearheaded. Elizabeth, it was her that God spoke to. When he tried to speak to the man, it did not go well. So, if you don't have a mother, have a wife. You don't have a wife. Hey my brother, pray so hard. But I tell you all men who have become something in this life. They will always say I thank God for my mother. God will use a woman because the devil know the sick. That's why he came to a woman. Whatever you give to a woman. So if you give her a good thing, she multiplies it and gives you a better thing. Hallelujah. But if you give her hell, she will give you hell fire. You brothers who are married, you need to cherish those women. A woman that is a woman of virtue. Let me tell you something. She is the second best gift from salvation. Salvation is number one. Not your church father. Nothing in this life, not even your job, but you are woman. Oh my my my can the brothers who are married. Brothers who are married have a problem. Can I hear your amen? God bless you, brother. women, they are a blessing. They have a connection with God. God deals with them so easily. And in the same way, Satan loves them. One woman like this destroy the whole world. Women have power if they yield to an authority. That's why sister never yield to wrong authority, never yield to wrong spirits. One woman like this who yielded to the devil many men to hell, preachers to heaven. That's how it is. A woman, you must be very careful to know what are you submitting to. Are you submitting to the word? Even when you accepting a man to marry, don't accept everybody. A man who is submitted to God. Amen. The first one to know about the plan of God, not the pastors, not the priests, not the big men, the church people, the little woman. God Mary, the angel of God, the general in heaven. Oh my sister called Gabriel with all his glory. When he came down, he did not go to any man. He did not go to any priest. He did not go to the king. He go to the high priest. He came to little old Mary. a little teenager and he came to her and saluted her and said, "Hail Mary." Now you need to know why was Mary favor. Mary was in a place for privilege where a great mystery that have been hidden for ages was going to be revealed for the very first time to her. My sisters, you are in a better place. My sisters, you are in a place of deliverance. my sister to the Holy Ghost. God will use you in a much better way and he will use 10,000. I know we preach women are not supposed to teach. If God is frustrating you, if God is frustrating you, God has a better plan. He can't tell you when you can't preach if he has nothing better for you. He has something [Applause] better. Come on. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Can I begin? Can I begin? A woman brings forth life. A woman stands as a as a strength to the man. A woman builds the society. A woman strengthens the church. A woman is a type of family. What are you talking about? Everything powerful in the world. Yes sir. That's why the devil knows it. try to to to pollute the women and make the plan of God obscure. But brother, sister, let me tell you, a woman that is yielded to God has great enormous power in her hands in Let me say this. I feel to say this under the anointing while you sisters that are married. Oh my. I'm saying this anointing now. Listen to you sisters who are married. Sisters all you here that are married. This is the word of the Lord for you. You have power. You have enormous strength to make that man whatever you want him to be. As long as you are led by the Holy Ghost. Amen. If you want him to change career, he can. I'm not crazy. I know what I'm talking about. If you want him to get a better job, he can. If you want 10 children, he can give them to you. Do you know what I'm talking about? And I'm saying this by inspiration. Why? God has given you and you alone that power. But you do not know how to wield it. Your man is a drunkard. You want him to stop. He can stop. Your man is a womanizer. You want him to stop. Come on. The power is with you. But how are you going to use it? The problem you women, you use your power in a wrong way. The moment you go to your husband and you begin lecturing him, you have wasted your authority. Remember, humble yourself. Submit yourself to your mind. And what will come next? Go on your knees. Pray for him. Every prayer you pray will do it. God will do it. You don't have to go to witchcraft. Go on your knees. If your man is a drunk, you wait and see. You will control him. [Music] But the problem the women of this generation they use their own mouth me brings out the lion that he who are you talking to sister you have lost But if you are able to brother my husband told me I can't come to church he's a drunkard man but pastors these days don't worry sister leave that man I'll give you another one They are all they are they are blind leaders of the blind leading the blind. But a prophet of this generation prophet told this woman you meant to be in church your heart your husband stay at home and be the best of a Christian you can ever be. live the life before him to him and then you will soon realize what God will do about 6 months later was water baptized in [Music] church power of a woman is in submission fight for the feeble God fights for the weak. Never raise your voice at your heart. That's a woman of bank. Humble yourself. Speak gentle as a woman. Remember, he is your Lord. You're not equals. I'm sorry. I don't care how you feel. says called her husband and that's what we preach and we believe in all over the world and a woman that does that and knows her place then you're going to watch the kind of power that you will if you use it what's the power submission number one number two that has power that you don't I've realized many times my wife speaks to me over time and and I also reason and later later on I see myself doing what she wanted me to do and then she says I know when she says that I know what she She pressed the remote. She prayed. Praise the name of the Lord. I think I'm not going to finish this sermon. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When we come back on Wednesday, I'm going to take you through the execution of the plan. And I now stopped prematurely. But if I continue, I'll take you for one more hour. God bless you for that. Stand on your [Music] feet. Hallelujah. There's too much to say. And I realize you always have too little time. Try to always come in midweek services. God has more for you. [Music] Amen. Can I have the song leader come and help us worship in a few songs? And this is a question. Somebody just asked a question right here. If the serpent never had a soul, how come the serpent seed has a soul? Because the serpent seed is not only from the serpent is from the mixture of humanankind it's taken through the seed of [Music] humankind whatever goes through like Jesus I mean whatever goes through uh humankind is 100% % human. Just like Jesus, I was supposed to get there but I did not. Just like Jesus was 100% God, but also 100% man cuz he went through the man. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I have a father.
