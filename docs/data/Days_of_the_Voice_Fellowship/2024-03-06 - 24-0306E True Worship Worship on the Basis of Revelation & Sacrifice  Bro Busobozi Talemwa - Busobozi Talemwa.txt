know how to count on on a but uh I I I am just not used to those things I think I'll have to maybe get into Apple watch praise God okay so it's it's 2 minutes to 6 so I just want to speak to you for one hour and um uh maybe I'll begin by sending our greetings to the Saints at evening light evening light who are going to also be streaming and listening to this service on their Zoom so we taking John 4: 20 and I'll read from up to verse 24 we'll be seated we shall read more later amen you may be seated after a while but do not be seated preach with me today even if you're on Zoom or on YouTube whatever you are just keep saying Amen to the word yeah some of you people who attend online you you just there and they are saying 10 people 20 people live but you not saying amen you need to keep saying amen amen amen we should be in the service and those of you here say Amen so that God can speak to us today how many are happy tonight amen I'm also happy tonight our fathers woried in this mountain and he said that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but how cometh and now is when the two worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth for amen you may be seated so I'm speaking to you today on the subject of true worship and um uh my inspiration is worship upon the basis of Revelation and [Music] sacrifice I've taken this uh scripture from the middle but most of us of course we've read the scriptures many times so we know how it starts it's a very familiar scripture this is the time when Jesus sends his disciples to go and buy meat as if to say 11 12 men cannot I mean have to buy a Kil two kilog of meat but Jesus the Bible says he must needs pass through Samaria you know God does not do anything by accident everything that God does is by Design none of us is a Believer by accident a Believer by Design we are a Believer by predestination God knew us before the foundation of the world and he knew that we would be here today he knew what type of cloth you would wear today he knew what type of color of the hair you would have how much hair you would have even knows the number of the hair on your head he even knows how many eyelids you have he even knows what you are currently thinking in your heart he knows he knew you would be here he knew You' be called a Believer today and he has set everything for you to follow according to his forign knowledge and so we are not here by accident but we are here to fulfill the purpose of God and that the devil cannot Hinder there's one more there's one important thing is for a human being to be in the will of God you will always accomplish the purpose of God whether it be good or whether it be bad that happens to you you will realize it will all work for good so the only thing you have to do that I have to do is to make sure that I'm in the will of God so if I know I am in the will of God then I am rested because I know that all is going to work for my and being in church I am in the whe of God so I know all is going to work for good today and I know I am working right where I am supposed to be so hearing what I'm hearing this evening God knew would hear the sound of my voice it is not me but God knew he would use my voice today that you would hear what he has to say to you and so God also knew you would open your heart and even going to hard it he knew you would Harden it but I know he knows that I would open my heart this praise the name of the Lord so he knew that he had to go through Samaria at such a time as that because there was a woman that was in trouble a woman that thought she was a worshiper but she was not a true worshiper and so God knew her before the foundation of the world and he knew how to find her isn't it wonderful to know that God knows how to find his own and so as a Jew Jesus wasn't supposed to meet this Samaritan woman but you see he he he told you know there was a bad blood between the Samaritans and the Jews because Samaritans were not considered to be pure Jews because during the time when Israel was under Babylon you know the king of Assyria sent a lot of U A lot of people to Samaria and so many of these uh people who came to Samaria then they intermarried with the Jews and then out of it came the tribe of the Samaritans so now these were not pure Jews and they were also not pure Gentiles and so the Jews did not like them because they were like the uh they were mul they were they were [Music] mixed they were not genuine so they had other false gods but they also worshiped the god of Israel so you can see that they were mixed up because and many other reasons the Jews didn't like them and so Jesus had 11 12 disciples and all of them did not like the Samaritans and so he knew I cannot meet this Samaritan woman if I have all my disciples with me and in case God has a rule God has a rule that he does not meet a Jew and a gentile at the same time if you read in the Book of Romans chapter 11 he explains the whole thing how he he has to Blind the Jews in order to Open the Eyes of the Gentiles and and right now the eyes of the Jews are blinded they were the the branch which was cut off and we were grafted on and the Bible says we should not also Bast because they were the original Branch if they were cut off because of unbelief then how much more the one which is not the original that is why there is only one thing which can save us from being cut off of that Olive Tree and that is faith we should keep believing the word and so Jesus laid away all the Jews why because Jesus was not a Jew and Jesus was not a gentile so in many ways he was like this Samaritan woman but he was also not Samaritan so you know Jesus was gone he was not Jew he was not gen he was not white he was not black actually it is say that even Jesus at that time he had a darker skin like the people of that time they were not white so Jesus was not a white man if anything he looked close to to to my skin but he was not black either but one thing that I know his Gene was a gene of God Jesus was God and he came down to the world to save the perishing he came to redeem the Sinners amen he came to bring Salvation he came to restore through worship because only God can be worship and so he now had to let aside all the all the Jews and then after he laid them off he could now meet the Samaritan woman and you know this Samaritan woman she went to the well at midday and that was a bad time considered for prostitutes because good women usually went in the in Dawn in the dawn the morning and and so a protitute would not mix up with them so she would they would always go much later so we don't know for sure whether she was a prostitute but one thing we can tell that by the time she went to the well she must have been one of them most likely a prostitute I want you to see something here Jesus knew what he was going for are you hearing me so when Jesus called you out of the world he knew what he was going for don't ever let the devil tell you that you are not good enough don't let the devil tell you that God cannot appreciate you well enough because he called me he knew what he called because he called me he loved me before he called me amen he he crossed all boundaries to get where the woman was oh come on church amenu I they feel good about this Jesus cross all boundaries to get to where I was amen and he called me out and here I am today and so when the Bible says I am spotless I believe it when the Bible says I'm a true worshiper I believe it no matter what the devil think why because when he called me he cross all boundaries to get to where I was and Jesus declared that they the Samaritans did not actually know what they worshiped so every you know you need to understand that they were mixed up in their worship they had a mountain that they thought that they were meeting their God but yet they retained other gods that they and every one of us before we came to a place of Revelation and sacrifice we actually did not know what we worship the how for two worshippers cometh and now is I pray that the holy spirit will make this real to us and so Jesus looks at the woman and of course this was after he had told her all the secrets of our heart he had told her how she he said go bring me he said fetch me a drink and the woman said how can you speak to me being you being a gentile and you being a Jew and me being and then Jesus said if you knew who was speaking to you you would know that I would give you the the water that I would give you you will never thir again if you drink of it I wish the whole world knew what Jesus brought to the world the moment you drink of it you can never thir let me tell you if you're still thirsting after the things of the world are you hearing me if you're still thirsting after those old movies if you're still thirsting after you know you know the games of the world your heart is still thirsting after alcohol after Birds after fornication after you know all the the sins and the things that are in the world if you still thirsting after makeup makeup if you still some believers they saying that Believers they're still thirsting after makeup some sisters even very good sisters they will say they will not use red red lipstick because that is like a painted face Jezebel but they get that kind of other lipstick and you find each time they applying in church they applying the preer is preaching and they applying you you are still thirsting did you not know that the more you use that stuff the more your body will thirst after it you even find men you doing that kind of things I'm telling you these are spirits one time when I was was in school in the hostel I noticed that boys would get Vaseline and they would put it on their lips because it was dry and so I notic yeah even my mouth dries so much so I said I also begin putting so I took I took my jelly and I put on my lips I was like yeah now it is better I realized soon it dried up so I applied again I applied again and I was like after a few days what has come over me am I becoming a s and I'm telling you that these are spirits the devil will make you thirst after things that you are never supposed to thirst after to after worldly music to and these things you thir after you are actually worshiping them without knowing you find your glue to some kind of movies you watching those movies of the world you're watching Hollywood and your eyes are stuck on those kind of you are stuck on games your hand is even even when you don't have your phone your hand is itching because your your mind is telling you where is the game sometimes even when you are in the church your hands begin itching you and then you take your phone until the pastor says listen to me like he what was happening to me because you don't know you are actually a slave to that gate you are a slave to Whatsapp you are a slave to Tik Tok slave to this social media to these movies of the world what is happening you are fasting after them but you don't even know that you are actually worshiping those things but what does God desire God is looking for true worshipers worshippers that will not worship religion you know many we have many believers who are not actually believers we have many believers who are formal believers who are believers religiously not not Believers indeed they they keep this thir you thirst after women you thirst after men you thirst after that after this after why it shows oh hallelujah hallelujah it shows amen you''ve not come to that hour youve not come to that place amen whereby you become a true worship the woman thought she was a you know the moment started speaking with Jesus I want you to see this Jesus began to tell her about her life said go call your husband she said I have no husband she said okay you've said well because you have five and the one you're living with now is also not your husband then the woman said sir I perceive you are a prophet and the moment you know because her life was designed Jesus is the word of God and when Jesus speak he designs your life do you realize that if a preacher stands before you and he preaches under inspiration he will actually amen open your life and put it there it is not him it is the word of God the Jesus because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever if Jesus was to be here you would do the same thing he only spoke a few words but the woman said he has said everything I have done because whatever Jesus said amen had exposed the woman the things she has she leave the things she has done she had done all her life the things she thought she was keeping as a secret let me tell you all of you here today whatever secrets you think you [Applause] have amen God it takes him a moment to expose all of them but because God is gracious he doesn't expose you but what does he do are you hearing me CH he brings a preacher to talk about the things you have been doing to talk about your secret life things that you know things you cannot deny and you know the preacher doesn't know and what is that speaking to you that is God that is the same Jesus the one that made the woman at the world is the same one here today that comes veing and then he exposes your life but why does he expose your life many people just get offended and they walk away they say maybe so and so spoke about maybe so and so told him and he came to preach against me but let me tell you no one amen will inspire a preacher but God Only God only inspires a PR to talk about your secret life and when you hear those things it is because God he wants you to be a true worshiper he's exposing you so that he can bring you to himself he's exposing you so you can repent so you can come to a place you realize I have been a wrong worshiper I thought I was a but I not a worshiper oh God make me a true no we are also Believers we worship on the other Mountain our fathers have beening on so you're talking about the things of God yeah yeah yeah maybe she might have thought that maybe someone told Jesus about her life and so she was not moved and so she started speaking those words and the woman said unto her perceive that thou a prophet I can see you a prophet because the things you're speaking no man knew therefore you were a prophet all right our fathers worshiped in this mountain and he said that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship the woman had to receive revelation of who this Jesus was she was speaking on two places the mountain of the I forget its name but the mountain of the of the Samaritans and that mountain was near she and and and the Jerusalem and so the Samaritans were always worshiping at that mountain but the Jews were always worshiping in Jerusalem because that's where the Temple of Solomon was and so the woman looking at Jesus being a Jew she thought to herself you Jews you say that we should go to Jerusalem to worship but for us we have this mountain where we've been worshiping the whole time and and so she did not realize Jesus was not introducing to her any place are you hearing me Jesus was not introducing to her any religion Jesus was introducing to her [Music] himself but the woman was about to miss it because she's talking about a place this place that place praise the name of the Lord and and and and then she says well uh Jesus says well what you worship you do not know but for us Jews we know what we worship because of course the the promise was that the Messiah would come out of David and that's why he said that salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now Jesus now goes beyond Judaism and he tells this woman the cometh the cometh tell someone the coming the com Hallelujah and now is when the two worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth oh mighty father seeketh such to worship Him are you hearing me Church the woman had a lot of preconceived ideologies what worship is like many of us have our preconceived ideas as long as I go to church and they will sing and maybe sing another special and the P speak a few words and then he pray for a few people and then we go home that's your preconceived idea about worship as long as I am seated in church and I go home then I've worshiped God and as long as I sing I pray I do this worship and you know I will go and when I lift up my hands God the holy spirit will come on me and I will sing and I will dance now let me tell you through Worship in one sense it is spontaneous and you cannot arrange yourself that I will do this and that and there is some a requirement we'll get into that many times when people say well I'm going to go and do this and the ho spirit will come that's not how usually it happens you do not have to have your preconceived ideas she had to come to a place of Revelation a place of sacrifice to become a true worshiper she had you know to break through the barriers of the history the history of the Samaritans they and and the Jews and Jerusalem and the mountain and this place and that place she had to break through all those barriers in the same way we also have to break through the barriers of of [Music] History many times we let our past lay Siege on us and then the Holy Spirit is not able oh I I hope you can follow me now on the holy spirit is not able to take us through to a place because we are so glued on our path if you want to be a true worshiper you must let your P go you must come to a place where you believe in in in the Jesus of today had to be set free she had to be liberated from all tribal Prejudice she had to come to a place where she's free openminded to accept God to come down I see it even a lot of times even in our services some where maybe God will lead a minister to sing a few songs people don't seem to walk into the anointing and they worship and because they're used in their mind all right the pastor will sing one song and then we shall go to the word so now when it becomes two four many switch off instead of entering into the if he says let us repeat the chorus five times that is too much why don't we be openminded and allow the Holy Spirit to come and overtake us all the Holy Spirit to come and overshadow us to the place whereby we become a true worship even the musicians if you used to play in a way that's not the only way be openmed be openhearted be ready for anything be ready for any drastic move by the Holy Ghost are you hearing me can we say Amen to that when we come to worship we must be ready for anything unplanned we must be ready for anything we do not know may happen if you feel like shouting don't say I did not plan to shout why am I feeling like this let me even go outside I feel like speaking in Tong and I didn't plan it oh no no I cannot come on Worship You You Lose Yourself you lose yourself if you feel like shouting there is a day here I had to say because I did not plan it but when I found it I said I have to do it because I'm not doing for myself or for the people I'm doing it for Jesus we must come to a place of being liberated our preconceived ideas about worship God will only accept the true worshiper God will accept someone who is ready to move when the spirit moves are you following me Hallelujah God is ready to accept somebody who will move when the Holy Ghost moves somebody who will run when the Holy Ghost runs amen somebody who will stand when the ghost stands how do you know because you'll be overshadow by the power of the Holy Ghost and you can feel him you can feel him don't if if if he gave you feelings in your body if he gave you emotions in your body those emotions why would you use them for the things of the world you be afraid to use it with the things of God someone gives you 1 million and you all over the place but when you come in church and the Holy Ghost moves then you're like ah okay let me put myself together come on be a true worshiper worship God in the spirit Lose Yourself amen if it means to dance and to shout feel free to do that we are Pentecostal people and we have to worship God even with our emotional the Holy Ghost is not emotional but the Holy Ghost is emotional Hallelujah whatever the Holy Ghost was whatever his anointing was people were emotional one time there was a man called David and David was anointed Amen to worship God Amen with a dance and when he began dancing when he began dancing the more he danced the more he felt like dancing the more he danced the more he danced lose himself that even his SCS fell what a king his clo is falling off while dancing for God and his wife looked at him and said look at this man how could heic himself like this before the people and God struck her bar don't ever laugh at a worshiper you may become bar in whatever you are doing don't ever despise a worshiper let me tell you chains break off [Music] worship worship is such a big subject but today maybe we'll begin a little bit and then we can see if we take it on we'll see how the Holy Ghost and so friends I want you to understand that never despise a worshiper it is in worship that the power of God moves and this woman she had preconceived ideas on what worship was come on say Amen somebody she thought that when when she when she goes on the mountain she's worshiping she thought she's a Samaritan she thought she listen to me when Jesus came to her he told her forget about jism forget about samaritanism forget about me and you I have something to tell you here I have something to tell you here you don't know what you are are worshiping you don't know what you're worshiping but I'm coming to tell you I know and we Jews we know what we worship but then he he went ahead and he went beyond Judaism and he said the cometh oh God send that now the coming and now is Jesus is always the Jesus of the now God is always the god of the now don't say I felt like worshiping I felt like jumping I felt like cing you f like it then you do it then there the hour cometh and now is when the two worshippers do I have some two worshippers here today when worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father SEC now worship you cannot worship without Revelation and you cannot worship without sacrifice those two things if they lack in your worship is not a true worship let us examine this woman a little bit more verse 24 God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth the woman said unto him I know that the mesiah cometh which is called Christ oh you didn't say Amen because you didn't get it Jesus just told the woman the things about her and she said I perceive you a prophet and then after that Jesus knew she had not realized who he was they were talking about Judaism and worship of the Jews and things and the mountain and Jerusalem and then later on follow closely here later on oh my God may you may God reveal this to you now it is becoming sweeter and S and then later on he says you don't know what you worshiping but the cometh the cometh and now is that was the mystery which had just been revealed but our eyes were still closed the come now is when the true worshipers shall worship God trth the father seeks such to worship and and God continued God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth and then then the woman now started coming closer now she said I know that the Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he is come he will tell us also so she knew that but she had no experience about it so you may know something but having an experience about what you know is something [Applause] else many people are Christians and they read the Bible but they don't have the experience of what is written in the Bible but the hour cometh and now is when people will realize that the god of the Bible is a living God by the time when you come to church and you have a problem and you are you are coming expecting a solution then you know God is the Bible says they that come to God must realize that he is and is a rewarder of all dently seek him you must realize that God is present you must realize that God is not a secret Amen to a Believer it is not secret what God can do what he has done for others he can do for you With Arms Wide Open God is a miracle working God what he has done in the past he can do today I'm telling you we must realize that God is we must believe in the Supernatural God we must believe in things we have not seen you call me a fool to do that well then you a fool not to do it because it is only a fool who does not believe in the existence of God but those who are believers they are wise they wise tell your neighbor you are wise you are wise because you believe that God is that God is come on say with me God is God is where I'm waiting for 10% of you to say God is is we are not called worshippers we are worship because we believe in the existence of God someone shout and Clap Your Hands for Jesus amen and we find here well I don't have to apologize for my excitement because the word of God is supposed to make me excited you will see what will happen to this woman shortly the woman she now said something and J was saying you are coming closer you coming closer I know that the Messiah cometh which is called [Music] Christ there is something I want you to see here the woman knew that the Messiah is coming it was head knowledge intellectual faith when he is come he will tell us all things it was intellectual Faith Jesus said unto her when Jesus comes the temp's power is brok when Jesus comes everything becomes clear let me tell it to you when Jesus once comes in your life you will realize it is him that matters and him alone not him and your effort not him and your situation not him and your mother not him and your friend not him and your father but him alone he alone matters my God praise God Jesus said unto her I that speak unto I'm he I'm he I want you to imagine what must have happened to that woman at that moment Hallelujah and the moment Jesus said those words as the woman was reacting as the woman was reacting to those words then the disciples came and mared that he was talking to the woman and yet no man said what what do you what are you looking for and what are you talking with her the woman then then that moment the woman left her water and went her way into the City and said unto the man come and see a man which told me all things that I have ever did is not this the Christ then they went out to the city and came unto him I wanted you to see how Revelation comes Jesus did not straight away say I am he he first spoke to her for a while he first designed her life now when if God wants to deal listen to me if God wants to deal with you if God has anything to do with any of you is going to do for you he will bring you he will drag you if he has to and se you set you down under the preaching of his word because that's the only way he has ordained for mankind to be restored red so he came to this woman why because the word of God the Bible says the word of God is a designer of the thoughts and intents of the of the earth it can even divide it is sharper than any can divide Soul and Spirit the word of God is powerful and let me tell you as always believe and I've believed give me any man give me any woman who has a soul who has a seed J of God in bring I don't care what he's doing he may be a drunken he may be a prostitute he may be so opposite and G Wayward bring him in the church sit him down under the preaching of this message if that man or woman is a seed of God he will sit under that word and that word will Design his life little by little little by little and one of these days that man that woman will be totally changed the only thing that can do to a seed of God is to remove them from hearing the word but brother don't worry about what you're going through in your life just make sure you do not leave the presence of the word hallelujah come under the word listen to the word every day listen to the word every evening when you at home listen to the word no matter what your life how it is and what will happen you will tell me you will be totally changed and even now as I'm speaking there are many who have changed already how many can Testify the word is powerful tell your neighbor the word is powerful the woman became naked before the word the word will make you naked your life will be before you how do you receive Revelation Revelation comes that way you sit under the word hear the word says faith is a revelation something that is revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God so by Revelation Romans 10:17 excuse me the Amplified version so faith comes by hearing what is told and what is heard comes by the preaching of the message that came from the lips of Christ the Messiah himself if I speak to you my words you can't receive Faith but if I speak to you the word of God you will receive Faith because the word of God is powerful no matter how hard your heart is the word of God will break you the word of God will break you the word of God is powerful but the devil is s that little guy he will try to take you out of the Pres of the so you don't get to hear so you don't get to change but as long as you stay under the word you will receive faith and if you do not have faith you do not have a Bas for true worship because faith is revelation and Revelation is Faith and you cannot worship without faith without true Revelation the woman said you know she waited under the preaching of the word and the mesiah SP of of faith in by the word which is spoken and then she ran and she said come see a man which told me all the things I've ever did is not this the Christ and the prophet says the great Shepherd is calling he's calling his seed his Sheep by name the creative voice of God is calling them from the Dust or changing their atoms even though they had not fallen asleep even even if they have not fallen asleep you know he those who have not died he will change their atoms those who have who have died and burried they will they will resurrect it is the rapture it is the great marriage supp of the lamb and his bride but the Rapture is not only uh uh the roll call no but the Rapture is not the only Ro call there at the second there at the second Resurrection at the white Throne judgment also will names be confessed before the father and his angels show you a roll call the first roll call is when we are alive here on Earth when we when we the word is preached to you you hear it you believe it you say Amen you accept it you've heard your name being called now it doesn't matter you may die but you will hear another Ro call and you will answer again even if you are you are dead and your bones have become soil you will not die forever I can become radical with this because it is worth it people become radical with all sorts of things only for this Earth but this is beyond the earth I believe in there Resurrection no matter what you call me I believe it will happen my name shall be called and again my name shall be called he says on the white Throne another names other name shall be called but I tell you friends I want my name to be called in the first resurrection because then I will know I'm safe and this woman as Jesus was speaking speaking to her she had a name and she ran to the city she said come see a man who has told me everything I have done isn't this the very Messiah and I believe he's here once again calling all our names and we are responding because we have believe this message and we have not believed this message to remain the way we are we have believed this message for us to be changed for us to be reborn we cannot claim to be Believers of this m and we still live like [Music] Sinners if we are inde believers this life has to be changed your desires have to be Chang hallelujah amen you you got to to receive another kind of life and my time is up but in a few moments I'll just summarize a little bit about Abel Abel and Cain they had to sacrifice now that that's where you see sacrifice without Revelation that's where you see sacrifice with Revelation and sacrifice without revelation in the message the invisible un brother says re and Revelation is only is the only thing the revelation of the word the revelation of the word Jesus said Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gate of Hell shall not Prevail against faith is a revelation because faith has been revealed to you Abel by faith offered by Revelation meaning by faith to God a more excellent sacrifice than that of now sacrifice means giving to the Lord whatever he requires of our time our Earthly positions you can say money Goods lands whatever it is and our energies to further his work so when I talk about sacrifice that's what I'm talking about you canot truly worship god without sacrificing but you can your sacrifice without Revelation cannot please God so two worshippers are those that are going to sacrifice but also with Revelation in in Matthew 6:33 says but seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you so to seek the kingdom you need to sacrifice other things first willingness to sacrifice shows our devotion to God the woman had to sacrifice her water pot you know you cannot claim that you are serving God when you're not ready to sacrifice that thing which you call so precious forget about it you might as well forget about serving God if you are not ready to sacrifice your Isaac you might as well forget about serving God if you are not willing to sacrifice the people and the land where you came from you might as well forget following God he was told God Abraham was told for leave your people leave your land and go to a land I'll show you so you ask me a question can I serve God can I truly worship God and still keep my things and still keep the desires of the world can I truly worship God and still go to a nightclub can I still serve God and I still do some little witchcraft can I serve God and I keep friendship with the world is impossible it is like east east from the West you simply have to choose you have to choose to lose in order to gain the woman had to choose the moment Revelation struck and that's why I said you may choose to live and forsake things but if you choose to do it mechanically without Revelation it will fail and we have seen so many people who have been soall Believers for many years even and after some years they say why I left the message why I'm no longer a Believer they were not a Believer to begin with what they had was intellectual Faith intellectual Faith fails but you have to have the faith like that of this Samaritan woman when when Revelation When Faith struck her she had come to FH water and she had this picture in her hand she forgot about it she said I will no longer care about it the Bible says she left it aside she let it break and she fall and rain with another pap let us have a new purpose let us be inspired by a new purpose listen Church it is an overhaul trajectory totally from the inside out that is what it means to have true worship and sacrifice has two things in it what you forego and what you give amen she left her picture Hallelujah and then she gave her time to hear the word and then she gave her time to testify and her strength and her heart to tell others about what God has done for you cannot sacrifice with that Revelation and you please God you must have faith in order to please God if you do not have faith you cannot please God and my time is up but I wanted to go to Abel that's what happened with Abel and both of them sacrificed but God rejected one and he accepted another because one sacrifice had Revelation it's not because you've given a million and has given 5,000 it is how much Revelation do you have what you're doing is is it by Revelation when you hear the word and God inspires do this for my kingdom and you don't do it whatever you bringing for the offering is nothing because you failed to obey and submit Revelation submit to the Revelation that you receive after hearing the word we'll talk more about it later God bless you Hallelujah let's pray father in the name of Jesus we youve just cut this short but I know that the people have heard what you intended them to bless each one Lord grant them Grace and Faith to do the right thing to make
