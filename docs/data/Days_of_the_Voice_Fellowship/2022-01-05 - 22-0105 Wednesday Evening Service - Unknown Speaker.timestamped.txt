[10:16] desperation means
[10:19] uh
[10:23] hopelessness
[10:27] desperation obama uganda

[13:44] desperation i never will not finish it
[13:46] today
[14:05] [Music]
[14:10] the inspiration for a few minutes now
[14:12] usually it takes a set of emergency to
[14:15] draw us into inspiration
[14:16] [Music]
[14:26] it is that to burn it has to do that but
[14:30] human beings are so slaughterful in
[14:32] their mind that it takes
[14:35] it takes an emergency something arises
[14:38] and when they do
[14:40] then it throws them into desperation are
[14:42] you
[14:43] [Music]
[14:53] it brings out the real thing that you
[14:56] are
[15:06] [Music]
[15:16] [Music]
[15:22] you remember don't forget our few
[15:24] definitions about inspiration
[15:32] unless you have no other solutions
[15:37] where is which god mean and the prophet
[15:40] says
[15:41] it takes the spirit of emotion
[15:46] he throws us into desperation
[15:49] [Music]
[15:52] is what brings out what we are really
[15:55] made out of
[16:02] praise be to god
[16:04] there are some people
[16:06] when
[16:34] the prophet
[16:50] [Music]
[17:30] because
[18:09] [Music]
[19:16] [Music]
[19:20] was taken in emergency
[19:32] [Music]
[19:34] i believe it says it is
[20:26] [Music]
[20:28] they knew that time god was fixing to
[20:31] destroy judgment
[20:40] [Music]
[21:26] have you ever bothered to ask yourself
[21:28] about this why are you waiting for the
[21:30] second song you know what is for all the
[21:33] spiritual failed people
[21:39] what's the prophet tells us
[21:41] without the
[21:57] amen amen
[21:59] we must identify ourselves with our
[22:02] sacrifices
[22:05] foreign
[22:50] [Music]
[23:02] amen mean we may god give us desperation
[23:06] catholic
[23:35] the when the years the seventh years was
[23:37] getting close

[28:18] smoke
[28:23] settling over the city
[28:27] the screams coming
[28:48] [Music]

[29:40] the passover event
[29:44] when god told them to slaughter a lamb
[29:49] the blood on the devil
[29:51] messiah
[30:07] [Music]
[30:26] [Music]
[30:37] [Music]
[30:43] [Music]

[31:10] in
[31:13] praise be to god
[31:15] you know these things will continue just
[31:17] like this

[31:24] in babylon
[31:28] do you think all the people were the
[31:30] only ones in public
