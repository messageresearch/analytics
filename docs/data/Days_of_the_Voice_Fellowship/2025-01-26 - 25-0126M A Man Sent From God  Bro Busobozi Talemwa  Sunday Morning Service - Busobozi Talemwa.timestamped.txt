[1:24:42] it's um a brief training from in one of
[1:24:45] the universities in
[1:24:49] India and so she sent greetings to the
[1:24:52] church
[1:24:55] um and also Sister
[1:24:57] Rose I heard from her this morning she
[1:25:00] said she is not able to uh to come
[1:25:02] because she had just arrived from the
[1:25:05] trip to
[1:25:09] S and a bit we in the
[1:25:12] flesh but I know she's following the
[1:25:14] service as
[1:25:16] well
[1:25:17] amen and uh thank you so much for the
[1:25:20] prayers you gave to
[1:25:22] us last Sunday
[1:25:24] when we were in
[1:25:26] L God answered your
[1:25:30] prayers he gave us quite successful
[1:25:33] meetings
[1:25:34] in we had a very good youth retreat
[1:25:38] there had a young people from I do not
[1:25:41] know how many but maybe more than 10
[1:25:46] churches across the northern region of
[1:25:51] Uganda and Pastor there Pastor Michael
[1:25:53] sent greetings
[1:25:56] and we we really had a good
[1:25:59] time with the young people
[1:26:02] there amen and so um before we go into
[1:26:07] the word this
[1:26:08] morning I wanted to remind
[1:26:11] you to hold the carja meetings in your
[1:26:17] prayers um
[1:26:20] the uh this tues Tuesday
[1:26:26] yes this Tuesday I'm going to be
[1:26:28] receiving Brother Gary walk Pastor Gary
[1:26:32] Walker at the
[1:26:34] airport he's arriving this
[1:26:37] Tuesday um and um then he we will
[1:26:40] straight away on Wednesday go
[1:26:44] toja so we are going to be having
[1:26:46] meetings
[1:26:49] Ino and meetings also in in mat
[1:26:56] for the side of nap so that covers the
[1:26:58] whole
[1:27:00] of maybe the Believers who might not be
[1:27:03] able to come are the ones who are a
[1:27:06] little deeper in the North North North
[1:27:08] North near near
[1:27:13] Sudan the ones that pastoris preaches to
[1:27:17] I don't know if they will be able to
[1:27:19] come but you pray for those
[1:27:22] meetings uh
[1:27:25] is kind of a bit
[1:27:28] different in
[1:27:30] that
[1:27:32] um um so it just requires you to pray
[1:27:35] for
[1:27:37] us I took brother Michael
[1:27:40] there m I took him
[1:27:43] there the other year it was not easy
[1:27:48] there's a place where we reached and we
[1:27:49] were
[1:27:51] driving and the road ended
[1:27:54] so I told Brother G are we going to pass
[1:27:58] he said pastor there
[1:28:00] there so I said I mean there's no Road
[1:28:04] he said okay you just follow that
[1:28:06] path so we we drove we're driving
[1:28:09] driving and we're just going to meet
[1:28:11] some believers who are in the in the in
[1:28:13] the
[1:28:15] interior so we reached
[1:28:18] somewhere and uh you know we're just
[1:28:20] driving through
[1:28:21] grass and boom we just hit
[1:28:24] some huge
[1:28:27] Stone and and uh you know our car got a
[1:28:31] very big
[1:28:33] issue and we got stranded
[1:28:36] there you know we don't get to talk
[1:28:38] about those things many times so that's
[1:28:41] why sometimes I just come here and say
[1:28:43] pray for
[1:28:45] us please always take it a point and
[1:28:48] pray because Mission work takes
[1:28:52] God Tak
[1:28:55] these people many you know many of them
[1:28:57] are
[1:29:00] unreached I don't believe the gospel is
[1:29:02] only supposed to be preached in
[1:29:04] cities I believe even in the
[1:29:08] interior where no one
[1:29:10] reaches as much as we God has given us
[1:29:13] the grace to
[1:29:15] go so when we have guest people like
[1:29:19] these I know there are many cities where
[1:29:22] they would love them to go
[1:29:25] but I I kind of always have a bden I say
[1:29:28] why don't they go and also minister to
[1:29:30] the Saints in the rural
[1:29:36] areas someone come all the way from
[1:29:40] Australia and then you have him preach
[1:29:42] at
[1:29:43] dvf or another church in the
[1:29:45] city and then he goes back and says I've
[1:29:48] been in
[1:29:50] Africa no so we need to take them in the
[1:29:53] interior
[1:29:56] yeah but I don't know how the situation
[1:29:58] there
[1:29:59] is it used to be that they had um uh
[1:30:06] instabilities
[1:30:09] Withers so and you know if they come and
[1:30:13] find you they ask for money or whatever
[1:30:16] they can har
[1:30:18] you uh and I forgot I shouldn't have
[1:30:21] said that online because if a brother
[1:30:23] from any this countries he has that he
[1:30:25] may not want to be taken in that
[1:30:30] place I hope Brother Gary doesn't hear
[1:30:34] this so but you know God has always
[1:30:37] given us
[1:30:39] Grace so we have to drive a certain
[1:30:41] certain
[1:30:43] hours we have to drive certain hours in
[1:30:46] that
[1:30:48] area so how many will
[1:30:52] pray pray for us God bless you and then
[1:30:55] on
[1:30:56] Sunday you saw the poster I put up do
[1:30:59] you have
[1:31:01] it you should you you have it I think we
[1:31:04] shared it on the if you could have it
[1:31:06] and share cuz there are others who are
[1:31:08] not on WhatsApp who didn't see
[1:31:10] it so we um we are going to have Brother
[1:31:14] Gary Walker here at
[1:31:18] dvf on Sunday morning so you can imagine
[1:31:21] it's going to be a marathon he's
[1:31:23] arriving Tuesday
[1:31:25] when is the day we traveling we shall
[1:31:27] arrive in the

[1:31:59] internet he had a terrible
[1:32:03] accident years

[1:32:08] impossible for anyone to survive in
[1:32:14] that but God did a
[1:32:16] miracle and he survived so I would want
[1:32:19] to interview him about
[1:32:21] that so that people can know

[1:39:27] um maybe for the whole story we can
[1:39:29] begin from verses
[1:39:35] one and Moses answered and said but
[1:39:38] behold they will not be believe me no
[1:39:40] hecken unto my voice for they will say
[1:39:43] the Lord has not appeared unto thee and
[1:39:45] the Lord said unto him what is that in
[1:39:48] thy hand and he said a rod and he said
[1:39:51] cast it on the ground and he cast it on
[1:39:53] the ground and it became a serpent and
[1:39:55] Moses fled from before it and the Lord
[1:39:57] said unto Moses put forth thine hand and
[1:40:00] take it by the tail and he put forth his
[1:40:03] hand and coat it and it became a rod in
[1:40:05] his hand that they may believe that the
[1:40:09] Lord God of of their fathers the god of
[1:40:12] Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of
[1:40:15] uh Jacob has appeared unto thee and the
[1:40:17] Lord said furthermore unto him put now
[1:40:20] thine hand into thy bosom and he put his
[1:40:22] hand into his bosom and when he took it
[1:40:24] out behold his hand was lipos lipos as
[1:40:28] snow and he and he said put thine hand
[1:40:31] into thy bosom again and he put his hand
[1:40:33] into his bossom again and plucked it out
[1:40:35] of his bosom and behold it was turned
[1:40:37] again as his other flesh and it it shall
[1:40:40] come to pass if they will not believe
[1:40:43] thee neither hecken to the voice of the
[1:40:45] first sign that they will believe the
[1:40:47] voice of the latter sign and it shall
[1:40:50] come to pass if they will not believe
[1:40:52] also these two signs neither hecken unto
[1:40:55] thy voice that thou shalt take of the
[1:40:58] water of the river and power it upon the
[1:41:01] dry land and the water which thou take
[1:41:04] out of the river shall become blood upon
[1:41:07] thy dry land and Moses said unto the
[1:41:09] Lord oh my Lord I am not eloquent
[1:41:13] neither thereof no since thou Hast
[1:41:15] spoken unto thy servant but I am slow of
[1:41:19] speech and of and slow of tongue

[1:44:40] aside to see God called unto him out of

[1:44:55] said I am the god of thy father the god
[1:44:56] of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of
[1:44:58] Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was
[1:45:00] afid to look upon and the Lord said I

[1:48:14] from you to
[1:48:16] preach amen if you can say
[1:48:18] Amen then I can be encouraged to
[1:48:23] amen oh that is not encouraging
[1:48:28] me are you going to encourage the word
[1:48:30] this
[1:48:32] morning amen well you just encouraging
[1:48:34] the preacher not the
[1:48:37] word so this morning I want to speak on
[1:48:39] a very important
[1:48:42] subject and I've titled it a man sent
[1:48:45] from
[1:48:49] God um I preached this some place but I
[1:48:53] think it comes to a Time some uh
[1:48:56] sometime where
[1:48:58] Believers have weird
[1:49:05] questions questions like um why do we
[1:49:08] quot William Brother Bram whenever we
[1:49:11] are
[1:49:14] preaching why do we talk about brother
[1:49:17] Bram as our prophet
[1:49:22] who has those
[1:49:25] questions now be a Christian be a
[1:49:29] Christi okay I say a few
[1:49:32] hands okay I see a few honest
[1:49:36] hands the others don't want to
[1:49:39] lift the pastor may mar me and say I'm
[1:49:43] an
[1:49:44] unbeliever it's all right to have
[1:49:46] question maybe for your
[1:49:49] comfort I also had th those questions
[1:49:55] when I first came to this
[1:49:57] message I had questions like
[1:50:00] that every time the pastor reads a few
[1:50:03] scriptures and more
[1:50:05] scriptures but for every scripture he
[1:50:08] reads he also says brother
[1:50:11] say and he reads for us what he says so
[1:50:15] would get confused I would say who is
[1:50:17] this
[1:50:18] brother why do they always have to tell
[1:50:20] us what he say
[1:50:23] why don't they don't why don't they just
[1:50:26] tell us what the Bible
[1:50:28] says but one time God opened my
[1:50:33] mind my spiritual mind and I
[1:50:37] understood when he reads me what the
[1:50:40] Bible
[1:50:42] says is actually not reading to me what
[1:50:46] comes out of God as a voice from
[1:50:51] heaven is reading to me what the man of
[1:50:55] God Jeremiah
[1:50:58] said what Paul
[1:51:01] said what Peter
[1:51:03] said what you know John
[1:51:07] said you know what Luke
[1:51:09] say what Matthew say who are these These
[1:51:14] are men of
[1:51:18] God the voice was good and then now it
[1:51:20] just went off so I if you could help me
[1:51:24] with the sound I would appreciate it so
[1:51:25] much okay now uh this God uses
[1:51:30] men tou your neighbor and tell them God
[1:51:33] uses
[1:51:36] men God always uses
[1:51:39] men there has been no time in in
[1:51:44] history where God did not use a
[1:51:48] man a true uh God follower
[1:51:54] the statements I'm going to make today
[1:51:55] in the preaching sermon are very
[1:51:57] important I may not be long but I want
[1:51:59] you to just follow
[1:52:01] them this is some kind of teaching
[1:52:04] Pastor
[1:52:07] someon it may not be all about
[1:52:10] excitement but is going to have a lot of
[1:52:14] learning so I want you to sit and
[1:52:17] listen but say Amen don't just
[1:52:20] listen amen and so God has always used
[1:52:25] men there has been no time in
[1:52:29] history where God spoke to men without
[1:52:32] using
[1:52:35] man show me at the time when it comes to
[1:52:39] God ministering to
[1:52:41] men he uses a
[1:52:43] man you know I'll give you an example
[1:52:46] right out um right at the beginning
[1:52:50] here there is a man called
[1:52:54] Cornelius was a good
[1:52:56] man he was a a prayer Warrior and he a
[1:52:59] man who usually gave to the necessity of
[1:53:01] the
[1:53:03] Saints he was a good man and he was um
[1:53:07] you know having a
[1:53:09] group and they were always in
[1:53:11] prayer and one time you know they were
[1:53:14] praying for God to speak to
[1:53:16] them and for for God to visit them and
[1:53:20] you know God did not just come down
[1:53:24] and visit them by
[1:53:27] osmosis or even by the
[1:53:30] spirit what God
[1:53:32] did he turned to
[1:53:35] Cornelius through the visitation of an
[1:53:39] Angel and we believe Angels still visit
[1:53:44] today it doesn't matter a person is
[1:53:47] religion as long as their heart is right
[1:53:50] with God
[1:53:52] have a hunger to hear from
[1:53:54] God an angel can visit
[1:53:57] them and an angel
[1:53:59] visited told Cornelius send a
[1:54:03] man to go to
[1:54:06] Jer there is a man there that I have
[1:54:10] prepared his name is Peter he's at such
[1:54:13] and such a place send him to go there
[1:54:17] and tell him to fetch him to come and
[1:54:20] speak to you my
[1:54:23] words that same Angel who came why
[1:54:26] didn't he tell Cornelius the words of
[1:54:31] God I will give you the answer because
[1:54:34] this was an
[1:54:35] angel God does not use
[1:54:39] angels to preach the
[1:54:41] word he uses men to preach the word to
[1:54:47] men but he uses
[1:54:49] angels to bring a specific message
[1:54:54] just like he uses anyone to give a
[1:54:55] prophetic utterance or a tongue and
[1:55:00] interpretation angels are simply
[1:55:03] Messengers they are not preachers are
[1:55:06] you following me now and then also at
[1:55:09] the same time he visits Peter and he
[1:55:13] tells Peter now prepare yourself of
[1:55:16] course you know the whole story the
[1:55:19] coming from
[1:55:20] heaven and a voice told Peter kill and
[1:55:24] eat Peter was a Jew there was all manner
[1:55:28] of
[1:55:29] animals according to the Jewish
[1:55:32] tradition they were not eating things
[1:55:34] like
[1:55:35] pigs and other things and but all those
[1:55:38] things were
[1:55:39] there Peter said no Lord I cannot eat
[1:55:43] that which is uh
[1:55:47] Unholy I
[1:55:49] cannot God told him by a name Ang you
[1:55:53] know God uses Angels who are you to call
[1:55:56] Unholy what I have made
[1:55:59] holy he said I have cleansed
[1:56:03] it but you see that was a
[1:56:06] sign because Peter is a man who belied
[1:56:08] that God only speaks to the
[1:56:13] Jews but God was showing him it was now
[1:56:17] the time for God to begin speaking to
[1:56:19] the Gentiles also
[1:56:23] the same God of
[1:56:24] Israel is the god of of the
[1:56:27] Gentiles we don't have another God our
[1:56:31] God by the way is the god of
[1:56:34] Israel that's why a true Christian will
[1:56:36] always be a supporter of
[1:56:40] Israel can we say Amen to
[1:56:42] that and now you know the Peter received
[1:56:46] that
[1:56:47] Revelation and that
[1:56:50] understanding of what he had to do
[1:56:53] and while he was there God told him I've
[1:56:56] sent you a
[1:56:57] man and this man came and told
[1:57:01] him that God has sent
[1:57:05] us Peter had received a
[1:57:07] message like coreli haded a message why
[1:57:11] was God doing
[1:57:12] that God was
[1:57:15] connecting a man sent from
[1:57:19] God to people who needed to hear from
[1:57:24] whenever you have a spiritual hunger in
[1:57:26] your
[1:57:28] soul God will send send a
[1:57:33] man to come and give you the spiritual
[1:57:36] food in this
[1:57:39] season and remember Jesus is the same
[1:57:41] yesterday done
[1:57:44] for however he has done this in the
[1:57:47] past he will do it the same
[1:57:50] way Hees change the
[1:57:53] pattern God has a pattern and that
[1:57:57] pattern does not
[1:57:58] change and so God sends a man and Peter
[1:58:03] went and
[1:58:04] preached he preached you know
[1:58:07] repentance and and he preached to them
[1:58:09] about Christ and he preached them they
[1:58:11] received the
[1:58:13] gospel and as he was
[1:58:15] preaching they received the baptism of
[1:58:18] the Holy Spirit and Peter told them
[1:58:22] since you have received the Bap of the
[1:58:23] Holy
[1:58:24] Spirit can you now be
[1:58:26] baptized and they were baptized in water
[1:58:30] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:58:33] the message which Peter preached is the
[1:58:36] same message which Paul
[1:58:38] preached the same message which Luke
[1:58:42] preached it does not change how you are
[1:58:45] able how are you able to know that a man
[1:58:46] is sent from
[1:58:48] God his message will not conflict with
[1:58:51] the messages of men that we are sent
[1:58:53] from
[1:58:55] God it will always align it will always
[1:58:59] be the
[1:59:00] same because listen if my source is
[1:59:05] God and someone else
[1:59:07] comes Brother Martin brother Julius
[1:59:10] Brother D or any of these preaching
[1:59:12] Brothers if our source is
[1:59:15] God we will say the same thing we will
[1:59:19] preach the same gospel it will not
[1:59:21] change even a
[1:59:23] bit so you see God used a
[1:59:26] man God has always used
[1:59:29] men there is no time in
[1:59:33] history in Bible History and in secular
[1:59:37] history where God did not use a
[1:59:40] man and God always has a
[1:59:44] witness a witness
[1:59:47] somewhere even today God has a
[1:59:50] witness and in every place God sends a
[1:59:55] man in every
[1:59:58] locality God sends a
[2:00:00] man but you see people always don't want
[2:00:03] to
[2:00:05] believe in a man they want to believe in
[2:00:09] something they don't
[2:00:10] know they would say why doesn't God come
[2:00:13] down in a powerful way and speak to me
[2:00:18] the powerful way God speaks to
[2:00:20] you sending a man and if you don't
[2:00:24] believe that
[2:00:25] man then you will perish I'll give you
[2:00:29] another example before we go into
[2:00:32] this there was a you
[2:00:35] know man that went to
[2:00:38] hell the Bible speaks of him and when he
[2:00:42] arrived in hell he realized it was too
[2:00:46] hot and he he told Laz he told you know
[2:00:50] Abraham father
[2:00:52] abrah okay if Lazarus will not give me
[2:00:54] some little
[2:00:56] water if because he told him there is
[2:01:00] you know a very big you know suspension
[2:01:01] between you and
[2:01:05] us we cannot come then and you cannot
[2:01:07] come
[2:01:08] here so the man had another request to
[2:01:12] make he said this at least let
[2:01:16] me go to my people on
[2:01:20] earth when they see a man from the
[2:01:24] grave someone who had died and is risen
[2:01:28] and they see me they will believe that
[2:01:32] God is real and and and and I mean the
[2:01:35] man now became a
[2:01:36] preacher everyone in hell is a
[2:01:40] preacher if God was to release the souls
[2:01:42] in
[2:01:44] Hell come out
[2:01:46] shouting Jesus is Lord
[2:01:48] hallelujah but they don't have that
[2:01:50] chance
[2:01:52] you have that chance
[2:01:53] now seese the
[2:01:56] opportunity inh the
[2:01:58] shout but friend if you shout here
[2:02:02] glorify the name of Jesus you will never
[2:02:05] shout in
[2:02:06] here because you use your opportunity
[2:02:10] well this man became a preacher he
[2:02:13] became a
[2:02:15] charismatic he said let me go I will
[2:02:18] preach to them and I will tell them you
[2:02:21] know Jesus is Alive and and and Abraham
[2:02:25] told him uh sorry that is not possible
[2:02:31] on where your people are they are
[2:02:36] preachers if your people will listen to
[2:02:41] those
[2:02:43] preachers then they will not come where
[2:02:45] you
[2:02:46] are I am one of those
[2:02:50] Preachers by the way this is
[2:02:52] reality they are preachers all over the
[2:02:55] world preaching the truth of God
[2:02:59] scpt the truth of God is
[2:03:01] what if people hear
[2:03:04] them they will never go to
[2:03:06] hell but do people always hear
[2:03:09] them no one time they used was
[2:03:14] preaching and you know he was you know
[2:03:17] you know heating on immorality and and
[2:03:21] how women
[2:03:23] how the devil is making them dress up
[2:03:25] naked and
[2:03:26] everything and um you know while he was
[2:03:30] in the
[2:03:31] church he saw a woman who was SE on the
[2:03:34] front
[2:03:36] seat know she had a
[2:03:39] minister soam removed his
[2:03:43] court praise
[2:03:46] God and they said
[2:03:48] sister do you mind
[2:03:51] if I can cover
[2:03:53] you and the sister threw it
[2:03:56] away and
[2:03:58] blasphemed and walked
[2:04:01] away the next time brother bam called
[2:04:04] was
[2:04:05] called that woman was
[2:04:08] Dy calling the name of brother
[2:04:11] BR that he should come and pray for him
[2:04:14] begging and
[2:04:16] crying and you know by the time brother
[2:04:18] bham went you know the woman was already
[2:04:23] where did she go you think straight to
[2:04:26] Hell well because she rejected the
[2:04:30] man and even today people reject
[2:04:36] men and another thing people always
[2:04:39] accept men that God sent
[2:04:42] before they they accept men God will
[2:04:46] send I will show you yeah God is going
[2:04:48] to send Elijah in the
[2:04:50] future you will say amen I will tell you
[2:04:53] God s
[2:04:54] elah you say amen and then I tell you
[2:04:58] now in our time God has sent
[2:05:02] Elijah how many are saying amen very few
[2:05:06] in our
[2:05:07] generation but there are people in this
[2:05:10] world they may be the minority but they
[2:05:14] have
[2:05:15] recognized that God has sent
[2:05:17] Elijah in our last
[2:05:20] days praise name of the Lord a man sent
[2:05:24] from
[2:05:26] God all right so that's just for uh for
[2:05:29] a foundation here now so let's get into
[2:05:32] the teaching now you see Israel was a
[2:05:35] convenant
[2:05:37] people and you know from
[2:05:39] Abraham to Isaac then on to
[2:05:43] Israel they had this
[2:05:46] conf God promised them a land flowing
[2:05:49] with mil
[2:05:52] but you see under
[2:05:54] Joseph they went to
[2:05:57] Egypt under
[2:05:59] Joseph during the time of the of the of
[2:06:01] the
[2:06:02] Pharaoh that did not know
[2:06:05] Joseph these Jews became
[2:06:08] slaves they were
[2:06:10] oppressed they were
[2:06:12] tormented I'll tell you one thing when
[2:06:15] God makes a
[2:06:17] promise his promise can never
[2:06:20] fail God can not forsake his
[2:06:24] elect wherever they are God will always
[2:06:28] find he will always find them and how
[2:06:32] does he find them he sends a man to call
[2:06:35] them
[2:06:36] out amen they may be in sin he will find
[2:06:41] them they may be in
[2:06:43] denominations in Catholicism in angc all
[2:06:47] this
[2:06:48] Pentecostalism you know what he will
[2:06:50] find it some of us were there he found
[2:06:54] us he called us out they may be in the
[2:06:58] world drinking sming immorality CLS he
[2:07:04] will always find
[2:07:06] them they may even be in
[2:07:09] witchcraft amen right now as I'm talking
[2:07:13] some of those seed of
[2:07:15] God they may be you know now smoking a
[2:07:20] pipe and
[2:07:23] calling but if they have a seed of
[2:07:26] God let me tell you God will always find
[2:07:30] them he would find them they may be in
[2:07:34] suffering he will find them they may be
[2:07:37] in pain they may be in distress they may
[2:07:41] be in oppression they may be in
[2:07:43] depression they may be in sickness if
[2:07:46] you are an elect of God He will always
[2:07:49] find you wherever you are
[2:07:52] his love go to the highest
[2:07:56] star his love go to the
[2:08:00] lowest whereever El
[2:08:04] is God has a
[2:08:06] mission and the mission is to find them
[2:08:10] and that's why he sends Men He anoints
[2:08:14] men man speaks as if he has a spell
[2:08:18] him what is anointing
[2:08:21] anointing breaks the York and what is
[2:08:25] anointing anointing is the grace of God
[2:08:29] to find the
[2:08:30] lost God anoints
[2:08:33] men sometimes he sends them to plead for
[2:08:36] the lost to the Dy sometimes he sends
[2:08:40] them to rebuke them sometimes he sends
[2:08:44] them to call them entice
[2:08:47] them different
[2:08:49] Ministry he sends them to
[2:08:53] why because God has a
[2:08:57] mission is to find a lost Ones is to
[2:09:01] find the seed of
[2:09:02] God I was one of them and I was lost in
[2:09:07] denomination oh God found
[2:09:10] me God found me God found me let me tell
[2:09:15] you if you're a SE of God even when the
[2:09:18] devil attempts to put you in sin
[2:09:22] God will
[2:09:23] ensure he will have a
[2:09:26] plan to pick you out of there hallelujah
[2:09:30] amen sometimes he would send a man
[2:09:33] sometimes he send a woman sometimes he
[2:09:35] will send you
[2:09:37] some you know what God will send
[2:09:41] someone no matter
[2:09:43] what and you know what there is
[2:09:46] something already in your
[2:09:47] soul which will believe the man sent
[2:09:51] from
[2:09:55] God and the children of Israel became
[2:09:59] oppressed and uh you know when God wants
[2:10:03] to find his
[2:10:05] children who were in
[2:10:07] Egypt
[2:10:09] oppressed tell me Church what did he
[2:10:17] do what did he
[2:10:19] do he sent a man
[2:10:22] shout it he sent a
[2:10:26] out oh I feel religious
[2:10:28] this he sent a
[2:10:31] man he sent a man he will send a man he
[2:10:36] will always send a
[2:10:37] man everyone will believe in
[2:10:40] that he will be
[2:10:42] sa that man is not is not the
[2:10:48] thing but that man always you to the
[2:10:56] promise every true child of
[2:10:59] God will never worship a
[2:11:08] manize when God sends a
[2:11:11] man when a man is sent from God and he
[2:11:15] stands on the p and he begins to preach
[2:11:19] no matter how old he is
[2:11:22] he may be so young he may be so old he
[2:11:26] may know how to speak he may not know
[2:11:28] how to speak but something in you
[2:11:32] recognize is a
[2:11:35] man why by a
[2:11:38] gift by an
[2:11:40] anointing he can be able to reach to
[2:11:43] your
[2:11:45] soul hallelujah hallelujah so we don't
[2:11:48] we are not men worshippers
[2:11:51] but we are men
[2:11:55] followers someone did not get
[2:11:58] that true children of God are not men
[2:12:02] worshipers but they are men
[2:12:05] followers if you can't follow a
[2:12:08] man you can never find
[2:12:13] God every man who has followed a man
[2:12:15] sent from God found God
[2:12:21] so when Israel was oppressed in
[2:12:25] Egypt God sent a
[2:12:27] man and this man is
[2:12:29] voice you know God could
[2:12:32] trust God could

[2:12:45] something in the book of
[2:12:47] Isaiah 40:3

[2:13:49] who louder
[2:13:53] John the
[2:13:54] Baptist oh I have good Bible
[2:13:57] reader John the Baptist so do you want
[2:14:00] to say John the Baptist is the
[2:14:04] voice crying in the
[2:14:08] wilderness
[2:14:10] yes everybody say
[2:14:13] yes John was that
[2:14:17] voice he was sent before the Messiah
[2:14:22] came and his work was to
[2:14:26] prepare for the Messiah to come how did
[2:14:30] he prepare by speaking to the Jews
[2:14:33] telling them repent for the kingdom of
[2:14:36] God
[2:14:37] is so John was the voice crying out of
[2:14:42] the
[2:14:43] Wilderness what is the wildness it is
[2:14:46] where he was
[2:14:49] leaving John was a the son of a
[2:14:52] priest but the moment he was born you
[2:14:57] know he went into the Wilderness he was
[2:14:59] eating Locust and
[2:15:04] wild but you know he would come
[2:15:07] out and speak and
[2:15:10] prophesy he had
[2:15:12] dreadlocks someone who the religious
[2:15:15] cires canot
[2:15:18] receive that's the one God used
[2:15:23] God is still in the same
[2:15:25] business God is a very good movie
[2:15:29] Act not even a movie actor he's a good
[2:15:32] movie
[2:15:36] director he puts a man there and
[2:15:40] everybody would
[2:15:41] say this one is not sent from God and
[2:15:44] then God watches but the seed will hear
[2:15:49] that voice
[2:15:51] why does God do that to confound the
[2:15:55] wisdom of the
[2:15:58] wise but the simple in
[2:16:01] heart they will melt at hearing of the
[2:16:05] voice when they hear the voice they will
[2:16:09] say that is my
[2:16:11] shepherd they don't see the man they see
[2:16:14] the
[2:16:15] shepher who is the shepherd David say
[2:16:18] the Lord is my shepherd

[2:16:28] through the of the Shadow day I will
[2:16:32] fear no

[2:16:45] hear God
[2:16:46] speak that to you is the word of God
[2:16:52] [Music]

[2:17:03] God he was speaking on God's
[2:17:06] behalf do we agree with

[2:25:33] scriptural
[2:25:35] context go John chapter
[2:25:38] 1
[2:25:45] 6 all right he say there was a man sent
[2:25:49] from God whose name was John oh I love
[2:25:53] that one now I love that one now can we

[2:26:02] was let us do it
[2:26:05] again did you hear that people don't
[2:26:08] like
[2:26:09] that there was a
[2:26:12] what a man sent from
[2:26:15] God whose name
[2:26:18] was the same came for a
[2:26:23] witness to Bear the witness of the
[2:26:27] light that all men through
[2:26:32] him might
[2:26:35] believe he was not that
[2:26:39] light but was
[2:26:41] sent to Bear witness
[2:26:46] of that was the True Light
[2:26:50] light every man that cometh into the
[2:26:53] world he was in the world and the world
[2:26:57] was made by him and the world knew him
[2:27:01] now that is a scripture in the
[2:27:03] Bible but let me read it in the context
[2:27:07] of my
[2:27:10] generation the ones who don't understand
[2:27:12] the
[2:27:12] Bible they will be shocked they will
[2:27:15] feel bad they will feel things and they
[2:27:19] will be offended
[2:27:21] but the ones who understand the
[2:27:22] Bible it is not a history
[2:27:25] book it a continuous book they will
[2:27:29] understand what I'm
[2:27:31] reading there was a man sent from
[2:27:35] God whose name was William
[2:27:38] Bram the same came for our
[2:27:42] witness to Bear witness of the
[2:27:45] life that all
[2:27:48] men in this end time
[2:27:51] bear
[2:27:52] witness will believe
[2:27:54] rather he was not that
[2:27:58] lightam was not that
[2:28:01] light I say again brother Bram was not
[2:28:05] that
[2:28:06] light but he was sent by God to Bear
[2:28:12] witness of that
[2:28:14] life and he says that was the True Light
[2:28:21] what is the true light Jesus Christ he
[2:28:25] is the light of the
[2:28:28] world a true
[2:28:31] Messenger will be sent to Bear
[2:28:35] witness of Jesus
[2:28:39] Christ and he says that light was the
[2:28:43] True
[2:28:44] Light which light every
[2:28:47] man in the world
[2:28:51] that that cometh in the world brother he
[2:28:54] was in the world he's talking about the
[2:28:57] light now
[2:28:58] Jesus he was in the world and the world
[2:29:02] was made by
[2:29:04] him this light
[2:29:07] Jesus he made the
[2:29:10] world for us our our
[2:29:12] Jesus is not the second person of the
[2:29:16] TR our Jesus is the creator of Heaven
[2:29:19] and Earth
[2:29:22] there is no above after
[2:29:24] him he is the
[2:29:27] above is the man on the
[2:29:31] top the Bible says let this mind be in
[2:29:35] you as also it was in Christ Jes who was
[2:29:39] in the form of
[2:29:40] God he was God himself and he thought
[2:29:44] did not Rob to be with
[2:29:46] God he never made himself equal with God
[2:29:51] but he was found in a fashion as a
[2:29:56] man he was gone but he HED
[2:29:59] himself even to the death of the
[2:30:02] Cross because he was in a fashion as a
[2:30:05] man God became
[2:30:08] man in order to display his
[2:30:13] life to the human race and then here he
[2:30:16] says he was in the world
[2:30:20] world was made by
[2:30:21] him but the world knew him
[2:30:25] not why did they not know him why did
[2:30:28] they reject I will tell you why because
[2:30:31] he came as a
[2:30:35] man amen men don't accept
[2:30:40] men but God said my sheep they know my
[2:30:46] voice my sheep they know my voice and he
[2:30:50] said let me go let me go into the world
[2:30:56] as a man no problem others will reject
[2:31:00] me but my sheep they know my voice when
[2:31:05] they hear it they will accept they will
[2:31:08] come to me
[2:31:11] [Applause]
[2:31:13] hallelujah oh my my it's quite
[2:31:16] interesting isn't it
[2:31:21] say I believe the
[2:31:23] Bible I
[2:31:27] don't it's just like saying I believe
[2:31:30] the
[2:31:31] Bible I believe Paul it's the same old
[2:31:36] Spirit even among some religious
[2:31:39] men they will tell you I believe the
[2:31:43] Bible but Paul
[2:31:49] some
[2:31:51] places he was not
[2:31:54] inspired
[2:31:56] Paul he had a problem with
[2:31:59] women that's why he told them they
[2:32:01] should not
[2:32:03] teach you see even he not
[2:32:06] marry Paul had a personal problem with
[2:32:10] women Paul was a woman
[2:32:12] hater
[2:32:14] Paul he had an
[2:32:16] issue with even
[2:32:18] Corinthians because
[2:32:20] in the
[2:32:21] church so he told them women should be
[2:32:25] silent Paul was a
[2:32:27] character and now when they come to
[2:32:31] theology they
[2:32:34] debating what do you think about
[2:32:37] Paul how do you see this
[2:32:39] one those are people who are uh uh want
[2:32:44] to explain or Reason the word
[2:32:50] we do not reason with the
[2:32:53] word When I See This Bible I don't see
[2:32:57] Paul and
[2:32:58] Peter when I see these words I see
[2:33:02] God at one place Paul
[2:33:05] said let your women be silent in the
[2:33:10] church God is not the author of
[2:33:14] confusion but then he said If any man is
[2:33:18] contous we have no
[2:33:21] in all we have no such
[2:33:23] custom in all churches of
[2:33:26] God and he said this if any man say God
[2:33:30] has sent
[2:33:31] them let him also know that God has sent
[2:33:35] us another place Paul say let it be
[2:33:39] known that the words I write to
[2:33:43] you are not my words but they are
[2:33:47] Commandments of God
[2:33:50] Paul said that why do you think he said
[2:33:53] that because people were rejecting
[2:33:55] Paul's
[2:33:57] words because there are places where
[2:34:01] Paul will say this is my
[2:34:04] opinion there are other scriptures where
[2:34:08] Paul will say this is not me this is God
[2:34:11] so which one do you
[2:34:13] take the one where he said is my
[2:34:15] opinion or the one where he said is God
[2:34:19] long as Paul said
[2:34:21] it it is the word of God to
[2:34:24] me why I tell you why because Paul was a
[2:34:29] man sent from
[2:34:32] God hallelujah I would rather take an
[2:34:35] opinion of a
[2:34:37] prophet then take a presumption and a
[2:34:40] prophecy of someone who God never
[2:34:47] said When God Says
[2:34:50] I am with this
[2:34:51] man so everything he says to me a
[2:34:56] Believer I take it as the word of
[2:34:59] God I don't care who says word if I
[2:35:02] believe God has sent this
[2:35:05] man even his
[2:35:09] opinion even his
[2:35:11] ideas as long as God allowed him to
[2:35:14] say I believe it is God
[2:35:20] one time brother bam was
[2:35:22] preaching and uh he was answering
[2:35:25] questions I don't remember the question
[2:35:27] he was answering and then he reached in
[2:35:29] the middle after answering the question
[2:35:33] and then he said wait something is wrong
[2:35:37] wait everybody okay no sick person no no
[2:35:43] problem everybody fine until the Holy
[2:35:47] Spirit it is the question you
[2:35:51] answer yes I answered it
[2:35:55] wrong I answered it wrong and then he
[2:35:58] went back again to and he corrected
[2:36:01] it talk about God standing with his
[2:36:08] man that book the questions and
[2:36:11] answers it's not
[2:36:13] ideal where he did not know he said I
[2:36:15] don't
[2:36:17] know where he knew he gave the
[2:36:21] whether it's about women's hair or it's
[2:36:24] about church
[2:36:26] order take it th say the
[2:36:32] Lord today's sermon is for
[2:36:36] believers I'm sorry our
[2:36:39] visitors you might as well believe
[2:36:45] today today I am not serving milk

[2:37:01] say
[2:37:03] Amen all right God uses men all the
[2:37:08] time the man is not the
[2:37:10] light the man Bears witness of the
[2:37:13] light we are not men

[2:37:27] brother brother was a man sent from
[2:37:32] God bear
[2:37:35] witness that Jesus is
[2:37:39] Alive am it is not him that God used
[2:37:43] alone there are others God used like him
[2:37:47] before and there are others God is using
[2:37:51] today but listen to this in every
[2:37:54] generation there is one major
[2:37:59] prophet in every
[2:38:02] generation there can be other
[2:38:05] Prophet but there's always one major
[2:38:08] prophet who the word of the Lord comes
[2:38:13] to okay let us get deeper into the
[2:38:16] scriptures Jeremiah chapter 1
[2:38:20] vers
[2:38:25] four then the word of the Lord came unto
[2:38:27] me
[2:38:29] saying before I formed
[2:38:32] thee in the bell I knew
[2:38:36] thee and before that came forth out of
[2:38:39] the womb I
[2:38:41] Sanctified and I ordained
[2:38:44] thee a
[2:38:46] prophet unto the nation
[2:38:50] am then said I oh
[2:38:53] Lord behold I cannot speak for I Am a
[2:38:58] Child praise the name of the Lord let me
[2:39:01] say this
[2:39:02] friends when God has a work for
[2:39:06] man begins working on him before he is
[2:39:09] even in his
[2:39:12] mother's this is true for Major
[2:39:15] Prophets it's also true for normal
[2:39:17] preachers
[2:39:21] if God has his hand upon
[2:39:24] you to do the work of God He will always
[2:39:28] protect
[2:39:30] you before you are born when you in the
[2:39:33] wom after you born he will always watch
[2:39:36] over you you are special in his
[2:39:39] hand because he has a work for you
[2:39:42] to you understand what I'm saying he has
[2:39:45] a work for you
[2:39:46] to that's why
[2:39:50] when it it comes to a minister of the
[2:39:53] Gospel you know someone might have a
[2:39:56] gift but if their life has too many
[2:40:00] corners their Ministry may not be
[2:40:04] successful so then what because God
[2:40:09] knows men have a problem believing in
[2:40:13] men but now a man who has many corners
[2:40:16] in his life
[2:40:20] a man finds a very huge problem
[2:40:24] in imagine if I had three
[2:40:27] wives and I come to preach to
[2:40:30] you you're all quiet because you're
[2:40:33] beginning to doubt
[2:40:35] now or maybe does he have
[2:40:39] them the moment you even hear a
[2:40:42] rumor Pastor did blah blah
[2:40:45] blah I even feel like I don't want to go
[2:40:48] to church again
[2:40:52] the moment a pastor becomes
[2:40:56] sinful let me tell you the whole church
[2:40:59] will
[2:41:01] be that's the truth if a pastor is a
[2:41:05] womanizer all the brothers in the church
[2:41:07] will
[2:41:09] be if the pastor is a
[2:41:12] smoker the people will become
[2:41:15] SM why anointing flows from the head
[2:41:20] all the way to
[2:41:22] the and that's why it is important the
[2:41:25] ministry you feed
[2:41:28] from we don't want only the
[2:41:31] gift we want the
[2:41:34] life the devil is
[2:41:37] gifted but he has no life of the
[2:41:41] world that's why for me when I'm trying
[2:41:43] to encourage young
[2:41:46] preachers I don't look only at the gift
[2:41:49] I look at the life if I see Life as
[2:41:54] Corners I will not I I will I will be I
[2:41:57] will not encourage that
[2:41:58] gift because I don't want to bless what
[2:42:01] God has
[2:42:03] cast I want to bless what God has
[2:42:07] blessed there is no man who can send a
[2:42:10] man it is God who anoints a
[2:42:13] man and he sends a man he told Jeremiah
[2:42:17] here before I formed
[2:42:21] thee in the
[2:42:23] womb I knew
[2:42:26] thee before you came
[2:42:28] forth out of the womb I Sanctified the
[2:42:33] and I ordained you to be a prophet so
[2:42:38] God is the one who for
[2:42:41] knows
[2:42:43] sanctifies and ordains a
[2:42:46] minister and especially a prophet for a
[2:42:51] generation and every God called
[2:42:54] man will always try to run away from the
[2:42:58] job how you know that God has called a
[2:43:02] man he will never want to become
[2:43:05] something some big
[2:43:08] shot no no no I'm the one who can do it
[2:43:11] very
[2:43:12] well many times when they
[2:43:14] ask you know when you when when you ask
[2:43:17] to minister you will feel
[2:43:21] insufficient no no I I no please why
[2:43:25] because because you know it's not your
[2:43:29] ability you always try to run away there
[2:43:32] is something God
[2:43:35] depos and he
[2:43:37] pulls many of the preachers who preach
[2:43:40] the gospel are pulled into the
[2:43:43] gospel they would have become very
[2:43:45] successful in the
[2:43:46] world they had dreams in the world
[2:43:50] but God breaks all that and he says I
[2:43:53] want to use it and then he brings them
[2:43:57] them and they fulf everything else and
[2:44:00] they focus on his
[2:44:01] work let me tell you God is still doing
[2:44:04] the same
[2:44:05] thing and we see that brother Bram was a
[2:44:10] very uh from a very poor
[2:44:13] background but from the time of his
[2:44:17] birth God declared
[2:44:20] he knew him the P of
[2:44:23] fire came right
[2:44:25] there came right
[2:44:27] there in the Log Cabin I wish you had
[2:44:32] that I didn't plan to say this so you
[2:44:34] have a
[2:44:36] Lin and give it to us where he was born
[2:44:40] his parents were so poor that they were
[2:44:42] living in log
[2:44:45] cabin but you see it right in with then
[2:44:49] like things like that in the
[2:44:52] window the light came through anded over
[2:44:56] that
[2:44:57] CH to
[2:44:59] signify a prophet is born
[2:45:03] today when he was seven years his father
[2:45:06] a maker of
[2:45:09] moonshine you know as he was going on
[2:45:11] the
[2:45:12] river to F water for his
[2:45:15] father out of the tree came a whole
[2:45:20] and a voice came out and him by name
[2:45:23] said
[2:45:24] William what is
[2:45:27] it voice said Never Smoke never drink
[2:45:32] never defile your
[2:45:34] body in any way because I have a work
[2:45:37] for you to do when you get
[2:45:40] older and he was only a little boy
[2:45:43] of he took off and went to his mother
[2:45:47] said Mommy a voice his mother said it
[2:45:50] was
[2:45:52] justan and then he took him to bed but
[2:45:56] God continued revealing
[2:45:59] himself and later on in
[2:46:02] 1933 you know when he was
[2:46:05] baptizing you know having a little
[2:46:08] church baptizing and out of
[2:46:12] that that same pill of
[2:46:14] fire the same that Paul
[2:46:17] saw the same that the children of
[2:46:20] Israel we are talking about God beinged
[2:46:23] out from the pages of the
[2:46:25] Bible to
[2:46:28] reality people
[2:46:30] saw some people
[2:46:33] heard thousands of people in the River
[2:46:36] Bank River oh in
[2:46:39] America and a voice came out of
[2:46:41] that and
[2:46:44] said and say this words he said John the
[2:46:50] Baptist was sent
[2:46:53] forth with a message to for on my first
[2:46:58] coming your message will forward on my
[2:47:03] second people heard that he was
[2:47:07] baptizing in the 17th
[2:47:09] person so who are you to
[2:47:12] say William Bram was a
[2:47:15] for when God
[2:47:17] himself came down
[2:47:19] and said here is a man I have sent to
[2:47:24] you God still uses
[2:47:27] men the Bible says he that receives a
[2:47:30] prophet in the name of a prophet we
[2:47:33] receive the prophet is
[2:47:36] reward we are those oh my God who have
[2:47:41] received a prophet our
[2:47:44] generationen I am just one of them they
[2:47:48] are many like me
[2:47:50] do I have some
[2:47:51] here do I have some here do I have some
[2:47:56] here and they are all over the
[2:47:59] world they in America they in Cong in
[2:48:03] Tanzania in Australia they in Ethiopia
[2:48:07] they in wherever even on the islands yet
[2:48:11] William Bram he never went there he
[2:48:14] never preached there he never sent a
[2:48:17] message there what is it
[2:48:19] God himself moving his world to restore
[2:48:24] people back again to the
[2:48:27] world William bram's
[2:48:30] message was was a
[2:48:34] witness to the
[2:48:41] light this is more than a
[2:48:44] church more than a prophet more than a
[2:48:50] this is not some kind of
[2:48:52] theology it is God sending a
[2:48:56] man to bring the
[2:48:59] light of his word back
[2:49:03] against and later on you know God would
[2:49:06] meet
[2:49:07] him in a cave and and and tell him how
[2:49:11] he would take the
[2:49:13] healing to the peop of the world you
[2:49:16] know with the sign of the hand and with
[2:49:19] a
[2:49:19] designment and everything
[2:49:22] happened and you know brother kept on
[2:49:24] talking about the
[2:49:25] P he kept on talking about it when he
[2:49:28] would design the
[2:49:31] people he would design
[2:49:33] them he would say I see a
[2:49:36] light on top of your head and out of
[2:49:39] that light he would begin to know
[2:49:42] everything about
[2:49:44] you I what was that light it was the log
[2:49:47] which came out of
[2:49:50] what was that it was Jehovah God the
[2:49:55] old trying to
[2:49:57] show the
[2:50:00] Y when when when when Paul asked who are
[2:50:03] you I am
[2:50:05] Jesus that Pillar of Fire the same which
[2:50:09] led the children of
[2:50:10] Israel theer it came in our day it came
[2:50:14] in our
[2:50:15] generation and one day as he was
[2:50:19] preaching you know he some people you
[2:50:21] know sent him
[2:50:23] out and and you know some Baptist they
[2:50:27] told him
[2:50:28] come we want you to prove your theory of
[2:50:33] Divine
[2:50:35] Healing you are saying God can heal
[2:50:38] people by prayer come and prove
[2:50:42] yourself and he said I cannot go to
[2:50:45] the you know it was in Texas
[2:50:49] this later on he came one of his
[2:50:54] associates he was a veteran
[2:50:59] preacher you know he was a veteran
[2:51:01] preacher meaning he had preached for
[2:51:02] very many
[2:51:04] years he was in his
[2:51:06] 90s he begged brother B he said let me
[2:51:09] go and prove it to them he said he said
[2:51:13] by by the boss I don't believe in Deb
[2:51:16] the I will not debate I not fast
[2:51:21] I would just go and tell them so he told
[2:51:24] me all right you can go and then by the
[2:51:26] BAM followed
[2:51:29] secretly he went and
[2:51:33] said and as this man you know people
[2:51:36] were talking and later
[2:51:39] on the Holy Spirit came
[2:51:41] to and on him to
[2:51:44] go that pill of fire
[2:51:47] came on him to
[2:51:50] go God
[2:51:52] speaks the same
[2:51:55] yest he told him now go I am with you so
[2:51:59] he went on the ppit he had a little
[2:52:02] piece of
[2:52:03] paper with a few
[2:52:05] scriptures and as he came on the
[2:52:07] pulpit that pit of fire was there knew
[2:52:13] was there people did not know but he
[2:52:17] knew and there's this man who was who
[2:52:19] had had a
[2:52:22] photographer you know he he was standing
[2:52:24] around there he would put that brother
[2:52:27] like
[2:52:28] that tell us what so that so that they
[2:52:32] can take that
[2:52:34] snap and and then it can go and and be
[2:52:37] put in the
[2:52:38] newspaper said Dr
[2:52:41] best corrected by William
[2:52:44] BR many pictures were
[2:52:46] taken this
[2:52:53] you know what
[2:52:54] happened as they took those
[2:52:57] photograph that pit of fire was right

[2:53:18] which is this
[2:53:20] one came
[2:53:21] out and you know what what happened the
[2:53:25] pill of fire killed all the darkness of
[2:53:28] the other
[2:53:30] pictures and this one came
[2:53:33] out and the P of fire was
[2:53:36] there the United States of
[2:53:40] America as a
[2:53:42] government recognizes this
[2:53:46] picture it let me tell you let me give
[2:53:48] you a little more details this
[2:53:51] picture was tested by a man called

[2:54:01] questioned
[2:54:06] document and he wanted they wanted to
[2:54:08] investigate
[2:54:10] this to try and
[2:54:12] see was the light
[2:54:14] there was it reted was it fake or what
[2:54:20] and they approved and
[2:54:23] confirmed that this is the only superal
[2:54:29] being that was ever
[2:54:32] photographed a
[2:54:35] camera that light right above
[2:54:38] there there is another picture I don't
[2:54:40] know whether you can find when he has a
[2:54:42] picture a paper like that speaking this
[2:54:44] one was like cut off but you see there's
[2:54:45] this other bigger one you
[2:54:49] that picture we always look at that pill
[2:54:52] of fire can you believe it that that is
[2:54:55] the same Pillar of
[2:54:57] Fire that was with Moses that made
[2:55:02] Paul they took this
[2:55:04] picture in Washington DC and they kept
[2:55:08] it in their
[2:55:09] record there's a video on the internet
[2:55:12] when Brothers Believers of this message
[2:55:15] they went into that Library
[2:55:18] check where it is
[2:55:19] there and video record when
[2:55:24] they god Jehovah God accepted to be
[2:55:31] photographed with a man he sent in our
[2:55:37] generation William Bram William Bram had
[2:55:40] the biggest healing
[2:55:45] campaign since World War I
[2:55:50] he was he was he was it was
[2:55:55] saved he was the
[2:55:58] initiator of the post World War II
[2:56:00] charismatic
[2:56:05] movement heing
[2:56:08] Revival that is why people like
[2:56:13] Ben they know and you have heard their
[2:56:16] testimonies
[2:56:19] they know all of
[2:56:25] old and he spoke
[2:56:28] statements which even me I cannot
[2:56:32] preach he spoke
[2:56:34] statements and I
[2:56:36] quot I saw God in that
[2:56:44] man
[2:56:47] PR he had failed in his
[2:56:50] ministry but when he came in the
[2:56:53] Min he saw a child getting
[2:56:57] healed he said he locked himself up in a
[2:57:00] room he said if this is the
[2:57:02] truth and if that power is from you God
[2:57:06] I want to see it in my
[2:57:08] Min or I die from
[2:57:10] here God gave it to
[2:57:12] him even came in this country
[2:57:22] but where did he begin
[2:57:23] from the meeting
[2:57:28] of so I can officially
[2:57:31] say even the p moov in
[2:57:34] ugand started with the Min of
[2:57:38] will only the
[2:57:43] majority they were so obsessed with the
[2:57:45] power
[2:57:48] and
[2:57:49] miracles of the life and Ministry of
[2:57:53] William is what you
[2:57:56] need it's what you need Jesus had many
[2:58:00] parts
[2:58:01] of Jesus had
[2:58:04] healing signs and wonders but had
[2:58:07] another
[2:58:08] part which many people did not like very
[2:58:12] much the opening of the
[2:58:15] word which we call the third pool
[2:58:19] the third pH of the ministry of Jesus
[2:58:23] and every man of God has those three
[2:58:29] faes signs and
[2:58:32] wonders
[2:58:34] designment and then the opening of the
[2:58:36] world so many of these
[2:58:39] brothers they believed William BR to be
[2:58:42] a man of
[2:58:43] God simply because his prophecies were
[2:58:47] right
[2:58:48] his designment was
[2:58:51] correct there was never a
[2:58:56] Miss heed the sick the lame walked the
[2:59:00] dead were raed signs and
[2:59:02] wers they all
[2:59:04] belied man of God but when brother Bam's
[2:59:08] Ministry
[2:59:11] turned from a healing Evangelistic
[2:59:14] Revival ralist
[2:59:19] to the
[2:59:21] prophet who would open the
[2:59:25] word the
[2:59:27] Elijah that would restore the
[2:59:30] word to the church straighten up the
[2:59:33] wrong
[2:59:34] doctr many turned away from
[2:59:38] him they say is a false
[2:59:41] prophet so he's a true Prophet when he's
[2:59:43] doing
[2:59:44] Miracles but he's a false prophet
[2:59:48] it tells you you are
[2:59:50] teaching there is a problem they
[2:59:53] misleading the
[2:59:55] people it seemed as if the Min
[3:00:01] of but let me tell you the word of God
[3:00:04] is like a
[3:00:06] seed when it has been
[3:00:08] planted it cannot
[3:00:11] die a
[3:00:13] messenger as witness of the L
[3:00:18] the people see the
[3:00:19] life they walk in the
[3:00:22] life and that life can never
[3:00:24] die as I speak to you
[3:00:27] today there are believers of this
[3:00:29] message in every corner in the
[3:00:33] world and yet we have no headquarter
[3:00:37] brother no
[3:00:39] headquarter what do we do simply believe
[3:00:42] the
[3:00:44] word so what am I saying we are not
[3:00:48] followers of a
[3:00:49] man we are the true followers of Jesus
[3:00:55] Christ
[3:00:59] amen praise
[3:01:02] God when God calls a
[3:01:05] man he calls the unqualified
[3:01:08] one he trains him he equs him and then
[3:01:12] he sends him maybe God is calling
[3:01:16] someone you might say I am not
[3:01:19] trained I am not equipped I am not un
[3:01:24] qualified don't you worry brother sister
[3:01:27] God will qualify
[3:01:29] you God will train
[3:01:32] you God will equip
[3:01:34] you God will send you
[3:01:37] out and when God sends you he vindicates
[3:01:42] himself if God sent you let him take
[3:01:46] care of you if a man sent you if a
[3:01:50] church sent you let it take care of you
[3:01:53] but I have some preachers that I know
[3:01:57] and I just happen to be one of them we
[3:01:59] are not sent by a
[3:02:01] denomination we are not sent by an
[3:02:04] organization we have not Bishop over us
[3:02:07] we are sent and equipped by
[3:02:10] God to reap the devil
[3:02:13] apart we have a commission from God
[3:02:18] the world the world is soon
[3:02:21] ending and the Rapture is soon
[3:02:24] happening and the children of God are
[3:02:28] preparing and God still heals God still
[3:02:31] delivers God still sets free do
[3:02:35] Miracle we are commissioned by God to
[3:02:39] preach
[3:02:40] that and let me tell you we have seen
[3:02:43] lives
[3:02:45] change even the wor SE as theer
[3:02:49] I don't care about those who are just
[3:02:52] coming around to say it doesn't
[3:02:55] work it
[3:02:57] works I have seen it
[3:03:00] works if you have seen it I want you to
[3:03:02] shout two times it
[3:03:04] [Applause]
[3:03:07] works hallelujah
[3:03:10] amen and someone came to me the other
[3:03:14] day and said you know what the message
[3:03:17] is working for me but you see when it
[3:03:20] comes to
[3:03:21] financials it is difficult I said do you
[3:03:25] pay your
[3:03:26] tith he said no would you give off no
[3:03:31] it's a
[3:03:32] principle if you do not pay your
[3:03:34] ties you don't give offerings your
[3:03:38] spiritual life will go down down down
[3:03:40] down even when you a beli of the
[3:03:43] message the message does not
[3:03:45] miraculously make you rich
[3:03:48] this message did not come to make us
[3:03:52] rich it came to amen amen P away for
[3:03:56] us to know the True
[3:03:59] Light so we can receive the reality of
[3:04:03] Christ in our soul so that we can be
[3:04:07] better prepared
[3:04:10] for if you want to be
[3:04:12] rich there are two things you can
[3:04:15] do give your ties without
[3:04:19] fail give offerings support the work of
[3:04:22] God and lastly
[3:04:28] work if you are lazy you will not be
[3:04:31] blessed God
[3:04:34] blesses how does he bless through the
[3:04:37] work of our
[3:04:39] heart God does Miracles how do they do
[3:04:42] it through the work of our hand has
[3:04:46] given you a mind
[3:04:48] he will give you a
[3:04:49] thought miraculously and he make you a
[3:04:53] millionaire that's how God works that's
[3:04:56] how we are being taught by our
[3:04:59] prophet and you tell me I shouldn't
[3:05:01] follow the
[3:05:03] prophet yet is leading me closer to
[3:05:07] Christ something must be wrong with
[3:05:11] you remember the 12
[3:05:14] disciples they were fishermen John the
[3:05:18] Baptist was a
[3:05:20] Bushman he had old
[3:05:22] looks and and old
[3:05:26] appetites Moses was
[3:05:29] untrained and you know he got trained in
[3:05:32] military God untrained him trained him
[3:05:35] again for 40
[3:05:37] Years brother bam was from
[3:05:41] p7 you find the things he was
[3:05:44] saying even psychologists and professors
[3:05:47] scratch the
[3:05:51] William
[3:05:52] brami in his
[3:05:54] ministry he cracked
[3:05:58] codes even professors had failed to
[3:06:02] crack how many have ever heard of the
[3:06:06] doctrine or rather the
[3:06:08] philosophy of
[3:06:12] evolution how many have heard
[3:06:16] of they
[3:06:18] man was an
[3:06:20] animal he just went changing
[3:06:25] changing and
[3:06:27] finally he became a
[3:06:29] man but that
[3:06:32] Evolution doesn't explain
[3:06:35] things if Man became was like
[3:06:39] that why doesn't
[3:06:44] he if truly man was an animal
[3:06:47] why are other animals not
[3:06:52] evolving man brought
[3:06:56] Evolution because he was
[3:06:59] confused see there is a connection
[3:07:03] between and human beings he did not know
[3:07:06] what that
[3:07:08] connection but brother bam came and he
[3:07:11] saw a
[3:07:13] vision he went right into the garden of
[3:07:19] and he began to narrate to
[3:07:21] us what exactly took
[3:07:25] place amen it wasn't a theological
[3:07:30] Doctrine it was shown
[3:07:33] him we now know there is surely a
[3:07:39] connection but it all started in the
[3:07:41] garden of
[3:07:43] Adam we know Cain was not a son of Adam
[3:07:50] these teachings are supported by this
[3:07:55] Bible the Bible says love your brethren
[3:08:00] not as C who was of that Wicked one who
[3:08:04] did not love his brother and he killed
[3:08:07] him his heart was that of Satan
[3:08:11] himself a murderous
[3:08:14] heart not Adam's heart he killed
[3:08:19] and God replaced that
[3:08:22] SE
[3:08:23] with and you know what we cannot
[3:08:26] separate Ser SE and go
[3:08:33] se but the Bible tells us everything is
[3:08:36] put now
[3:08:37] down under faith and
[3:08:44] unbelief if you believe the word
[3:08:47] the chances are you are a son of
[3:08:53] God the Bible says today I'm loed I
[3:08:57] don't
[3:08:58] know the Bible says that the sons of
[3:09:02] God he that is born of God listen cannot
[3:09:08] sin do you believe
[3:09:10] that what does it mean cannot
[3:09:15] sin sin is what
[3:09:19] unbelief now you know how did we know
[3:09:21] that sin is
[3:09:23] unbelief by the prophet Through the
[3:09:27] Bible sin is the unbelief of the
[3:09:31] truth so a a believer that is born of
[3:09:34] God will always believe the
[3:09:39] word so because he's born of God he he
[3:09:44] cannot sin and believe
[3:09:47] but the seed of the
[3:09:49] serpent will always
[3:09:52] sin they will never believe the
[3:09:56] word and
[3:09:59] ande and for them they don't they
[3:10:03] just they just getting
[3:10:06] mad you will feel you want to
[3:10:11] hold and say
[3:10:13] understand but they
[3:10:15] refuse because the SE
[3:10:24] word even if they are
[3:10:27] wrong say Lord forgive me help
[3:10:31] me bring me back to
[3:10:34] your the seed of God in
[3:10:38] you that seed cannot
[3:10:41] seem even if you
[3:10:43] error you want to return that God will
[3:10:47] have
[3:10:48] mercy because in you there is a seed of
[3:10:52] God hallelujah hallelujah

[3:13:05] Passover for I will pass through the
[3:13:08] land of Egypt this night and I will
[3:13:10] Smite all the firstborn in the land of
[3:13:12] Egypt both man and Beast and against all
[3:13:16] the good of Egypt and I will execute
[3:13:18] judgment I am the Lord and the blood
[3:13:20] shall be to you for a token upon the
[3:13:22] houses where ye are and when I see the
[3:13:25] blood I will pass over you and the
[3:13:26] plague shall not be upon you to destroy
[3:13:29] you when I smite the land of Egypt and
[3:13:32] this day shall be unto you for a
[3:13:34] memorial and he shall keep it a feast to

[3:13:43] living bread even the first day ye shall
[3:13:45] put away living out from among your
[3:13:47] houses for whosoever eate the living
[3:13:50] bread living bread from the first day
[3:13:52] until the seventh day that Soul shall be
[3:13:55] cut off from Israel this is the
[3:13:57] Egyptians also had
[3:14:00] goats you follow the story have you
[3:14:02] follow the
[3:14:04] story there's a revelation I want to get
[3:14:07] here
[3:14:08] now let me ask you a
[3:14:12] question God told through Moses
[3:14:18] this was the night of the
[3:14:20] Passover and God told the
[3:14:23] Israelites to eat
[3:14:26] lambs every every
[3:14:29] house and they should then take the
[3:14:32] blood on
[3:14:36] door and when the angel of death
[3:14:39] comes he will pass over them so I have a
[3:14:42] question for
[3:14:43] you did the Egyptians also have Lambs
[3:14:52] okay their
[3:14:54] LS did they have
[3:14:58] blood okay could they eat the
[3:15:03] meat all right there is one more thing
[3:15:06] he told them they should also eat it
[3:15:09] with bit
[3:15:14] HS and uned bread
[3:15:17] okay so the question
[3:15:19] is the Jews were living
[3:15:24] inan were these HS only growing in
[3:15:32] go no I just answer the
[3:15:35] question the
[3:15:37] bread was it only
[3:15:41] in so we all
[3:15:43] agree everyone including the Egyptians
[3:15:47] had the
[3:15:50] hubs they had the
[3:15:52] bread they had the lamps and their blood
[3:15:56] LS had
[3:15:57] blood and they also had mouth to
[3:16:00] eat but there is something they didn't
[3:16:04] have that was a Difference
[3:16:09] Maker Hallelujah do you know what that
[3:16:12] was why was it
[3:16:21] amen don't say shout it why they
[3:16:25] have a man sent from
[3:16:30] God let me announce to you
[3:16:33] child the difference was one thing a man
[3:16:37] sent from
[3:16:39] God and I want to say the
[3:16:41] denominations they have the same Bible
[3:16:44] we have
[3:16:47] but their
[3:16:49] words canot be
[3:16:52] quickened why the quickening
[3:16:56] power of the written
[3:16:59] word comes with the spoken
[3:17:01] word which comes out of a man sent from
[3:17:07] God there in a spoken word is rapturing
[3:17:14] Faith remember faith is a revelation
[3:17:18] Fai comes by
[3:17:19] hearing hearing by the word of
[3:17:22] God
[3:17:24] 37 God will do nothing but he will send
[3:17:28] his
[3:17:29] word to the prophet so when a prophet
[3:17:33] comes he comes with th say the Lord take
[3:17:38] BS make it like this do it like this the
[3:17:42] same Bible they have is the Bible we
[3:17:45] have but when we we read it we have some
[3:17:51] ingredients the same ingredients they
[3:17:54] have but when we take it we apply it
[3:18:01] differently they they read Matthew
[3:18:06] 28 go into all the world all the world
[3:18:10] blah blah blah blah me read it to you go
[3:18:15] Nations iing them in the name of the
[3:18:18] father and of the son and of the Holy
[3:18:21] Ghost they read that we read that when
[3:18:25] they read it they go and begin I baptize
[3:18:29] you in the name of the father
[3:18:33] son you who has a
[3:18:36] man you hear them and you say what did
[3:18:40] you say no that's not what he say
[3:18:46] come on I'm rejoicing up here that's not
[3:18:49] what he say what did he say he said when
[3:18:54] they see father son Holy
[3:18:56] Ghost for you you see Lord Jesus
[3:19:02] Christ they ask you where did you take
[3:19:05] that
[3:19:09] from a lot of
[3:19:11] onions you have to put ons you cannot
[3:19:15] make without Liv without onion without
[3:19:20] things but for you you have been
[3:19:23] listening to a different
[3:19:26] sound a sound which showed
[3:19:29] you what you did not know
[3:19:31] brother and now you can be able to say
[3:19:35] there should be no
[3:19:38] k
[3:19:39] no nothing else nothing but the blood
[3:19:44] of when they have the father
[3:19:47] who separate God from the
[3:19:49] son separate from the Holy
[3:19:52] Ghost for you you will read a
[3:19:55] scpt and elah will tell
[3:19:58] you to read first John
[3:20:02] 57 there are three that bear record in
[3:20:05] heaven the Father the word the Holy
[3:20:08] Ghost and these the
[3:20:14] three so when we when we sing the song
[3:20:16] How
[3:20:18] Great Is Our God for them they sing you
[3:20:22] know we even sing the same
[3:20:23] song the different

[3:20:54] three the EOS are getting what I'm
[3:20:58] saying hu do I have
[3:21:03] some meaning we don't believe in the
[3:21:09] Trinity three persons in
[3:21:12] one they make God like a bunch of GRA
[3:21:17] but for us we
[3:21:20] understand God is a
[3:21:22] spirit God who became the
[3:21:25] father he became the son he is the holy
[3:21:29] spirit same God the god three are
[3:21:38] one why we have a

[3:22:31] Bible where it say your hair is your
[3:22:35] glory where did we get that from a man
[3:22:39] sent from

[3:22:49] Jesus Christ you shall receive the Holy
[3:22:51] Ghost we receive the true Holy
[3:22:53] Ghost not a false one that makes them
[3:22:57] speak false

[3:25:39] voice of
[3:25:40] theeven when it shall begin to
[3:25:43] Ser the mystery of God
[3:25:46] give me that picture of the church ages
[3:25:48] the Myster of God shall be finished the
[3:25:52] mystery of God has been
[3:25:56] finished we are living in a
[3:25:59] generation where the seventh messenger
[3:26:01] has
[3:26:03] come and his voice has went
[3:26:06] out just like the voice of Mo of
[3:26:10] John the voice of theas De
[3:26:14] Prophet has gone out to do what to
[3:26:17] finish the mystery of God to Bear
[3:26:20] witness of the True
[3:26:23] Light seven Church
[3:26:25] ages we know the first church age was
[3:26:29] epes Paul was the
[3:26:31] messenger and you know it's the age
[3:26:34] which was aimed
[3:26:36] at God was moving in power the truth of
[3:26:40] the word had been
[3:26:42] brought and we see there comes the
[3:26:44] second chap
[3:26:46] this is in the Book of Revelation
[3:26:50] by you know what is it it's a age of
[3:26:54] bitterness and death you know when the
[3:26:57] false Church
[3:26:59] system started persecuting
[3:27:02] the but then come the third
[3:27:05] church and you can see the years down
[3:27:07] here it is from 53
[3:27:11] ad from the days of the
[3:27:14] Apostles as time goes on
[3:27:17] Generations would
[3:27:18] change every generation God would send a
[3:27:22] star those stars are The Messengers to
[3:27:26] the churches we
[3:27:29] see for the Dark
[3:27:32] Ages
[3:27:35] persed and then comes pegamos which
[3:27:38] means
[3:27:39] married we see at that time the church
[3:27:41] and the state married
[3:27:44] together the cathol
[3:27:46] Church became the state
[3:27:48] church and we find that now they made
[3:27:52] the One World
[3:27:54] Church that's why they called
[3:27:56] Catholic means
[3:27:59] worldwide and they began persecuting
[3:28:02] everyone who is not part of that
[3:28:04] church but there was a star and there
[3:28:07] was a message which
[3:28:09] went and then comes another
[3:28:13] age at this time means
[3:28:18] dominating at that time the Catholic
[3:28:21] church had you know dominated all over
[3:28:24] the
[3:28:26] world until today you can see the
[3:28:28] remnant
[3:28:30] of everywhere you go the Catholic church
[3:28:33] is the biggest church by
[3:28:37] far how did they get
[3:28:39] members by killing and threatening and
[3:28:41] all that kind
[3:28:43] of they killed actually Millions
[3:28:47] millions of Christians who had refused
[3:28:50] to
[3:28:51] bow to their madm religious
[3:28:55] teachings you know that what I'm saying
[3:28:57] is
[3:28:58] proof even if I was taken to
[3:29:01] court oh I can finish
[3:29:04] that even recently the pope of Rome was
[3:29:08] officially
[3:29:11] apologizing for killing
[3:29:13] Christians he say is deep regrets that
[3:29:18] but you cannot take the blood of the
[3:29:21] saint from your
[3:29:22] hands the Bible in the Book of
[3:29:24] Revelations talks about the Roman
[3:29:26] Catholic Church as a woman as colored
[3:29:30] woman see that upon many
[3:29:33] Waters many Waters is the world the of
[3:29:37] the world covering all over the world
[3:29:40] but it says
[3:29:41] drunken with the blood of the
[3:29:44] S is quite interesting phras and then we
[3:29:47] see sadis for the next
[3:29:50] age and God uses Martin
[3:29:54] Luther and sadd means the escaped
[3:29:58] on you know Luther was a member and a
[3:30:01] pre in the Catholic
[3:30:04] church but he
[3:30:06] resisted he he resisted the
[3:30:09] first he protested and with him the
[3:30:13] Protestant movement started
[3:30:18] he escaped the false Church
[3:30:21] system and we see there comes
[3:30:24] FL and then comes a man John wh that God
[3:30:28] so
[3:30:29] used this was a missionary
[3:30:32] AG where the gospel went all over the
[3:30:35] world you know between 1750 to
[3:30:41] 1906 from
[3:30:44] 1906 the last chch age
[3:30:47] started that last Church age is
[3:30:52] called interesting do you know what
[3:30:56] me people's
[3:31:00] rights is it not our
[3:31:03] generation is it not our time dog rights
[3:31:06] Women
[3:31:09] rights
[3:31:11] rights man rights people's rights
[3:31:15] everything right
[3:31:17] a child a child can take a parent to the
[3:31:21] police because he was
[3:31:24] disciplin rights of children rights of
[3:31:27] everything you know what we are living
[3:31:30] in the middle of that
[3:31:31] generation and we we have
[3:31:34] witnessed God s sending William
[3:31:37] BR as the last
[3:31:39] Messenger to our
[3:31:42] generation but that
[3:31:44] messenger would be the
[3:31:47] Elijah the Bible promised would
[3:31:50] come can I stand here today and I tell
[3:31:53] you Church Elijah has
[3:31:59] come amen give me the last picture
[3:32:03] brother praise the name of the Lord I'm
[3:32:06] descending now I'm landing anytime
[3:32:10] soon praise the name of the Lord and so
[3:32:13] we see that we have had five comings of
[3:32:21] Elijah was the first one to come his spe
[3:32:25] Came Upon
[3:32:26] elishah then comes John the
[3:32:28] Baptist
[3:32:30] will the last elah to the
[3:32:33] Jews can you put off these lights
[3:32:36] brother so that the people can see
[3:32:38] better oh oh these ones okay just put I
[3:32:41] want people to see this picture as much
[3:32:43] as they can
[3:32:46] praise the name of the Lord and so we
[3:32:48] see the first age all
[3:32:51] right we see the first
[3:32:53] Elijah Was Elijah
[3:32:59] the first K
[3:33:01] 171 you can read all about about I don't
[3:33:04] have time to go the
[3:33:06] scriptures but we see when he left of
[3:33:10] his
[3:33:12] Spirit Came Upon Elijah
[3:33:15] praise
[3:33:16] God perfect you can see
[3:33:19] it so a double portion of the spirit
[3:33:22] Came Upon
[3:33:24] Elijah Second Kings
[3:33:26] 2:1 you can read about
[3:33:29] elah and how the spirit of elah Came
[3:33:32] Upon then you see there comes the third
[3:33:38] Elijah now before that thir
[3:33:41] came in the Book of
[3:33:44] Malachi there was a proph
[3:33:47] which said behold I send you Elijah the
[3:33:51] prophet now we see that that Elijah
[3:33:54] already come and come but again there
[3:33:56] was a prophecy that Elijah would
[3:34:04] come Malachi
[3:34:06] 31 The Voice the scripture says behold I
[3:34:10] sent my messenger
[3:34:12] before and then the Lord whom you sck
[3:34:16] shall suddenly come into
[3:34:18] His who is talking about the message of
[3:34:22] the who is Christ who is God himself
[3:34:27] before the Messiah would
[3:34:30] come this had to
[3:34:33] come what was his
[3:34:35] name John the
[3:34:37] bapst but John fulfill the first part of
[3:34:41] Malachi 4
[3:34:46] there was another part which is yet to
[3:34:51] happen which talks about before the
[3:34:54] coming of the Dreadful day of the
[3:34:58] Lord don't miss this part before the
[3:35:02] Dreadful day of the
[3:35:04] Lord Elijah will come
[3:35:06] again the Dreadful day has not yet
[3:35:09] come are we not still
[3:35:12] waiting listen before it comes
[3:35:16] elah must go to the
[3:35:19] Jews right here but where are we we are
[3:35:24] right
[3:35:25] here before Elijah goes to the
[3:35:29] Jews remember we the
[3:35:31] Gentiles we are grafted in by
[3:35:35] Grace God by
[3:35:37] Grace gives us a portion a portion which
[3:35:41] was for the
[3:35:42] Jews hefts Us in there and he sends us
[3:35:46] an
[3:35:47] Elijah who was supposed to be for the je
[3:35:51] but he sends him to the Gentile
[3:35:54] SP listen listen carefully listen
[3:35:58] carefully are you hearing are you
[3:36:02] hear listen carefully William bram's
[3:36:07] Ministry was so
[3:36:09] outstanding that it was exactly the
[3:36:11] Elijah Ministry
[3:36:15] interviewed him and they asked him a
[3:36:18] question you going to Israel will be
[3:36:20] accepted how would your ministry be
[3:36:24] received and he answered this he said I
[3:36:27] believe my Ministry shall be received in
[3:36:31] Israel because the Bible says the Jews
[3:36:36] seek after
[3:36:37] signs the Greeks after
[3:36:41] [Music]
[3:36:43] wisdom the Greeks after wisdom
[3:36:47] so in other words his ministry had signs
[3:36:51] and
[3:36:52] wonders
[3:36:54] Des you remember that
[3:36:59] woman
[3:37:03] byah Reve the
[3:37:06] Messiah so he went on the plane to go to
[3:37:10] Israel but do you know
[3:37:12] what God came down and he spoke to
[3:37:16] he said no you cannot
[3:37:19] go it's not the
[3:37:22] time listen the ministry he
[3:37:25] had the exact Elijah
[3:37:28] Ministry the Jews are waiting
[3:37:31] for if he had gone
[3:37:35] there it means it would have confused
[3:37:38] the whole timeline of
[3:37:41] God the GLE church had to be served
[3:37:44] first
[3:37:46] they had to be raptured
[3:37:48] first then the Jews receive
[3:37:52] a so they
[3:37:54] can so William bram's
[3:37:57] Ministry could not have gone to the
[3:38:01] Jews because it was not the
[3:38:03] time then he
[3:38:06] understood amen then he
[3:38:10] understood his
[3:38:11] ministry was for the Gentiles
[3:38:16] so by Grace God sent us an
[3:38:21] Elijah
[3:38:22] Ministry to restore
[3:38:26] our back to the P
[3:38:31] father and that is the
[3:38:33] ministry I don't have time to go into
[3:38:35] all the
[3:38:36] scriptures I'll just send out a link
[3:38:38] where I explained
[3:38:41] that of all the
[3:38:43] scriptures on the on the church if
[3:38:45] you're not on the church WhatsApp
[3:38:47] group and you will get that link so you
[3:38:50] be to listen for about 1 hour
[3:38:56] explanation that show the coming of
[3:38:58] Elijah in our
[3:39:01] time so after a l of our
[3:39:04] time who is actually William
[3:39:07] Bram then comes Jesus
[3:39:10] Christ again for the Rapture of the
[3:39:13] Bride after that
[3:39:16] then comes
[3:39:17] Elijah and Moses to the
[3:39:21] Jews after that then we now see the Lord
[3:39:25] coming back
[3:39:27] again to the
[3:39:28] Earth together with us who would have
[3:39:32] been with him in
[3:39:34] heaven what is he coming to do to rule
[3:39:37] over the
[3:39:38] world for a period of 1,000
[3:39:41] years will you be in the millennial
[3:39:45] I cannot wait to
[3:39:47] be oh hallelujah amen hallelujah and
[3:39:51] William Bram said this William and I
[3:39:54] want to finish with this let me Lear
[3:39:56] with
[3:39:57] this not for one
[3:40:00] moment do I bring a
[3:40:03] message to the people that they may
[3:40:07] follow
[3:40:08] me or join my
[3:40:11] church start some fellowship
[3:40:17] organization I have never done
[3:40:20] that and I will not do that
[3:40:23] now I have no interest in those
[3:40:26] things but I do have an interest in the
[3:40:30] things of God and the people and if I
[3:40:33] can accomplish just one
[3:40:35] thing I will be
[3:40:38] satisfied that one
[3:40:40] thing what is it that he wanted to see
[3:40:44] I'm now reading to you
[3:40:46] in William bram's own words his
[3:40:48] intention of his
[3:40:54] ministry that one
[3:40:56] thing is to see established a true
[3:40:59] spiritual
[3:41:04] relationship between God
[3:41:07] and where men become New Creations in
[3:41:12] Christ filled with his spirit
[3:41:16] and living according to his
[3:41:18] word I would invite you I would plead
[3:41:23] want all to hear his
[3:41:26] voice at this time and he your
[3:41:30] lives completely to
[3:41:32] him to who to Christ even as I trust in
[3:41:36] my
[3:41:37] heart that I have given my all to
[3:41:42] him said he had given all his life
[3:41:47] and I have given my all to
[3:41:49] him you all give your life to
[3:41:52] Christ and he finishes by
[3:41:55] saying God bless you and may his coming
[3:41:59] rejoice in

[3:42:25] finally let me say
[3:42:27] finally God has sent us a man who is not
[3:42:32] interested in starting a
[3:42:34] denomination who is not interested in
[3:42:37] men following him that is interesting in
[3:42:41] bringing
[3:42:42] you into personal relation
[3:42:47] with Jesus
[3:42:48] Christ I say
