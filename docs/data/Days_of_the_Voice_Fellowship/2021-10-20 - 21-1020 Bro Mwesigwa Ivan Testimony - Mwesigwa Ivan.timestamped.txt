[1:28:57] it's good for us to hear you know the
[1:29:00] bible says that some through the waters
[1:29:06] some through the fire
[1:29:21] but if you are a believer
[1:29:24] of this message
[1:29:28] like the brothers say the purpose of god
[1:29:30] has to
[1:29:31] see you through god
[1:29:36] no matter what the devil does sing songs
[1:29:39] i cannot take you before your time
[1:29:44] you remember when
[1:29:45] they came here i think it was the other
[1:29:47] week but you cannot sign the weekend

[1:30:04] is
[1:30:07] [Music]
[1:30:18] oh
[1:31:01] in that generation will fight and they
[1:31:03] will have to overcome avant mode
[1:31:08] so that they can be called overcomers
[1:31:12] of course
[1:31:27] amen and
[1:31:29] has to be accomplished
[1:31:34] whether the devil likes it or not
[1:31:39] imagine this brother being knocked twice
[1:31:45] [Music]
[1:31:55] again
[1:31:58] i don't know if some of you know a
[1:32:00] brother pastor called gary walker simon
[1:32:04] i'm assuming
[1:32:08] if you want this testimony you can
[1:32:10] search it on a you can put testimony of
[1:32:12] gary walker on youtube you'll get it
[1:32:19] in australia
[1:32:21] australia he has a similar testimony
[1:32:24] he was driving
[1:32:41] there
[1:32:42] they said that that had to be a miracle
[1:32:47] and he was there with his family
[1:32:49] [Music]
[1:32:51] he came out alive navajo
[1:32:59] that reminded me as the brother was
[1:33:00] speaking it reminded me of the testimony
[1:33:02] of john uganda
[1:33:06] john was banned in oil
[1:33:09] [Music]
[1:33:10] and the man did not burn
[1:33:13] and they said he's a witch
[1:33:18] so they asked the brother are you sure
[1:33:20] you are alive
[1:33:38] [Music]
[1:33:47] you know in an accident you can die and
[1:33:49] then you were about to speak sir ah the
[1:33:51] man almost killed me when you actually
[1:33:53] already did it
[1:33:59] one man told him he said the man is dead
[1:34:02] he just doesn't know yet
[1:34:07] that's why they were
[1:34:09] they were asking him if you are if
[1:34:11] indeed you are alive do this
[1:34:38] is
[1:34:57] why because there is still a purpose in
[1:34:59] his life which was to be achieved
[1:35:04] i believe one of us is for him to be
[1:35:07] here to share these stories
[1:35:12] i'll just read this
[1:35:34] [Music]
[1:35:44] he went down and fought through all
[1:35:47] kinds of impersonations of janice and
[1:35:49] jambress
[1:35:54] i'm
[1:36:14] he comes out of egypt going up to the
[1:36:16] promised land where god said you will
[1:36:18] worship me on this mountain
[1:36:20] [Music]
[1:36:37] so yeah
[1:36:38] yeah you'll get the listen to these
[1:36:40] words
[1:36:41] yes he says no pharaoh can kill him
[1:36:50] father was a
[1:37:04] he is
[1:37:44] so we are on our road to glory
[1:37:50] hallelujah i mean that's why it's
[1:37:52] wonderful to hear such a a wonderful
[1:37:54] testament
[1:37:58] on this wonderful road to glory
[1:38:11] because moses was
[1:38:13] pre-destinated kuwangan
[1:38:28] no
[1:38:56] and the will of god
[1:39:01] nothing is going to stop us
[1:39:04] no sir say what do you want god is going
[1:39:08] to vindicate his wife
[1:40:06] since then
[1:40:08] you know twice

[1:41:02] i think it was about the 10th or 15th
[1:41:05] floor somewhere around
[1:41:07] him
[1:41:10] this chinese
[1:41:30] even the way they behave inside so when
[1:41:32] they knock something they just behave as
[1:41:33] if they had a meeting a family meeting
[1:41:39] but in this case
[1:41:40] i was a foreigner
[1:41:42] and we had bibles everywhere
