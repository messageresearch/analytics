[46:20] [Music]
[46:22] Yeah.
[46:26] Yes. All right. So, vers 15
[46:32] to vers 18.
[46:34] How many love the Lord this evening?
[46:38] Amen. Amen. And the angel of the Lord
[46:40] called unto Abraham out of heaven the
[46:42] second time, and said, By myself have I
[46:46] sworn, sayaeth the Lord, for because
[46:47] thou hast done this thing, and hast not
[46:50] withheld thy son, thy only son, that in
[46:54] blessing I'll bless thee, and in
[46:56] multiplying I'll multiply thy seed as
[46:58] the stars of heaven of the heaven, and
[47:00] as the sand which is upon the seashore,
[47:03] and thy seed shall possess the gate of
[47:05] his enemies. And in thy seed shall all
[47:09] the nations of the earth be blessed
[47:11] because thou hast obeyed my voice.
[47:22] [Music]
[47:42] [Music]
[47:49] [Music]
[47:55] Amen. You may be seated. So this evening
[47:58] we're just going to part five of our
[48:00] true origin.
[48:05] I don't know media department is it part
[48:07] five
[48:10] but we are speaking on the subject of
[48:11] the royal seed this evening
[48:16] the royal seed
[48:19] so here we we all know this promise that
[48:23] God gave to Abraham
[48:26] and if you give me your undivided
[48:28] attention because we're just going to go
[48:29] straight into the word
[48:33] He says that in blessing I will bless
[48:35] thee
[48:37] and in multiplying I will multiply thy
[48:39] seed as the stars of the heaven.
[48:45] Amen. Now this is God's promise
[48:49] to Abraham. So he says, "I will bless
[48:52] you and I'll multiply thy seed
[48:56] as the stars of the heaven
[48:59] and as the sand which is upon the
[49:01] seashore."
[49:04] And then he continues and says, "And thy
[49:06] seed
[49:08] shall possess the gate of his enemies.
[49:15] And in thy seed
[49:17] shall all the nations of the earth be
[49:19] blessed.
[49:22] Now I want you to notice that here he
[49:24] was not referring to the natural seed
[49:26] Isaac.
[49:30] He was referring to the spiritual seed
[49:33] Jesus.
[49:37] Jesus
[49:39] supernatural seed,
[49:43] the spiritual seed
[49:45] in Jehovah Gyra Bam says, "Now Abraham,
[49:48] the promise was made to Abraham.
[49:52] [Music]
[49:54] and his seed after him.
[49:57] Not only Abraham,
[50:00] but his seed.
[50:02] Amen. But his seed. Now the seed,
[50:06] natural seed of Abraham
[50:09] was Isaac. The natural seed of Abraham
[50:12] was Isaac.
[50:15] But the spiritual seed of Abraham's
[50:18] faith
[50:22] was Christ.
[50:24] So not through Isaac all the world was
[50:27] blessed.
[50:30] But through Christ
[50:33] the royal seed
[50:37] all the world was
[50:40] for he died for all people.
[50:43] He died for all nations
[50:46] and all peoples.
[50:48] Have you got it? So the seed that he's
[50:51] talking of here
[50:54] when he says that uh and your seed shall
[50:56] possess the gate of his enemy
[51:00] and in your seed shall the nations of
[51:01] the earth be blessed.
[51:04] He's not talking about the natural seed.
[51:09] He's talking about the royal seed, the
[51:12] spiritual seed.
[51:16] The whole earth was not blessed through
[51:19] Isaac,
[51:21] but the whole earth was blessed through
[51:24] Christ.
[51:26] So Christ is that royal seed
[51:30] of Abraham.
[51:32] Christ is the spiritual seed
[51:35] of Abraham. So that's why when Jesus
[51:38] came to earth
[51:40] when he was born the Pharisees did not
[51:44] understand who he was
[51:46] because the Pharisees you remember when
[51:48] we were studying this study um this
[51:50] subject we we we read scripture in John
[51:55] and we we saw that discourse between
[51:57] Jesus and the Pharisees
[52:01] how they kept on exchanging words
[52:04] and the Pharisees kept on the Jews, they
[52:08] kept on claiming
[52:10] that they were the seed of Abraham.
[52:13] And Jesus said, "No, Abraham cannot be
[52:16] your father."
[52:18] Because if Abraham was your father,
[52:21] you would have received me because
[52:24] Abraham received me and Abraham rejoice
[52:27] to see my day.
[52:29] And he was glad. And he said before
[52:32] Abraham
[52:34] was before Abraham was I am. And they
[52:39] were offended when he spoke those words
[52:42] because they failed to understand
[52:45] that this Jesus was not talking about
[52:49] the natural his natural lineage.
[52:54] Actually his natural lineage did not
[52:56] matter.
[52:58] His
[52:59] natural lineage did not matter.
[53:03] What mattered was his spiritual lineage.
[53:08] Friends, I want to tell you your natural
[53:09] lineage also does not matter.
[53:14] What matters is your spiritual lineage.
[53:18] What is your connection
[53:21] with your father? I'm not talking about
[53:23] the natural father.
[53:27] Amen. The natural father,
[53:30] you know, may be from one tribe and
[53:32] have, you know, many things out of that
[53:35] tribe. You might have a lot of problems
[53:37] through that tribe.
[53:40] But I tell you, we have another lineage.
[53:44] It's a spiritual lineage.
[53:48] Every child of God that came from God is
[53:50] a part of that lineage.
[53:54] And our true origin
[53:57] is not from our physical natural
[53:59] lineage.
[54:02] Our true origin
[54:05] is not from an island in
[54:10] or somewhere in
[54:14] somewhere in
[54:16] somewhere in
[54:18] Toro. Are you following me? That's not
[54:22] where our true lineage is from.
[54:26] Naturally, we came from there.
[54:29] But really, our natural lineage does not
[54:31] matter
[54:34] because it dies and ends. It has a a
[54:39] beginning and it has an end. But our
[54:42] spiritual image, it has no beginning. It
[54:47] has no end. And that's why Jesus said,
[54:50] "Do not fear those who can kill the
[54:53] flesh,
[54:55] but fear him who has power over your
[54:59] flesh and over your soul."
[55:02] But and you know where we came from. We
[55:05] have no beginning of days.
[55:08] We have no end of days.
[55:10] And so was Jesus.
[55:13] He was promised that he would come.
[55:16] He was a promised seed
[55:20] and he came for a specific duty
[55:24] and he had to fulfill that duty.
[55:27] The devil by the way when you think
[55:29] about these things you feel encouraged.
[55:33] The devil could not stop the duty which
[55:35] he had come to a
[55:39] fight him. But there was a promise that
[55:42] he would possess
[55:45] every game of his enemies. So the devil
[55:49] could try but he could not hinder him.
[55:53] He could not defeat him. He could not
[55:56] stop him. That was our savior Jesus
[55:59] Christ.
[56:01] He was the spiritual royal seed of Abra.
[56:05] Now let's let's take um a scripture here
[56:08] in Matthew.
[56:11] Matthew chapter 1 vers 1.
[56:17] Um there are many verses we can look at
[56:20] there.
[56:22] I just want you to focus here with me
[56:25] and and and let's follow this
[56:30] book of the generation of Jesus Christ.
[56:34] Amen.
[56:36] Are you following here? Now, Matthew is
[56:39] beginning by uh you know with this term
[56:43] the the book of the generation of Jesus
[56:45] Christ.
[56:51] You know in Uganda when they tell you
[56:53] walk like a Uganda
[56:57] it means you you have to give your
[57:00] generations
[57:04] you. Who is your father? Who was his
[57:07] father? Who was his father? Who was his
[57:10] father? Until we reach the last last
[57:13] one.
[57:15] So now here when we begin looking at the
[57:18] generations of Jesus Christ,
[57:22] the Bible now begins, he says Jesus, he
[57:26] begins wi with David
[57:29] and he says the son of David,
[57:33] the son of Abraham.
[57:37] Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord.
[57:38] Amen. Now you you there are many things
[57:41] we can talk about
[57:44] but when you see that now from there he
[57:46] goes on to say Abraham begott Isaac
[57:50] and Isaac begot Jacob and Jacob begot
[57:53] Judas and his brethren and then from
[57:57] there he will go from Judas to Farz
[58:01] to Zah to to to and and you know he will
[58:03] go to Es
[58:05] to to Aram and and you will
[58:09] all the generations
[58:13] and I want us to just because of time to
[58:15] go down
[58:18] um on vers uh 15.
[58:22] Okay, I hope you're following me and I
[58:25] would begot
[58:26] [Music]
[58:27] and begott
[58:30] and m begot Jacob and Jacob begot
[58:33] Joseph.
[58:35] Amen. Jacob begot
[58:38] Joseph and Joseph the husband of Mary.
[58:45] Now when we oh praise the name of the
[58:48] Lord when he's just about to reach where
[58:52] or how Jesus comes into view
[58:58] all those other ones up.
[59:01] He was mentioning a man a man from whom
[59:05] the seed came from.
[59:09] you know so and so begott so and so so
[59:10] and so beg and so and so but now when he
[59:14] reached on the portion which speaks of
[59:17] Christ
[59:19] then he says and Jacob begot Joseph
[59:23] Joseph the husband of Mary
[59:26] whom of whom was born Jesus
[59:30] [Music]
[59:32] who is called Christ. So who begott who
[59:35] there
[59:36] Can we say it is Joseph?
[59:39] No. Is not Joseph.
[59:42] Jesus here was the seed of the woman
[59:49] but not of Joseph.
[59:52] Follow me closely.
[59:54] You see in the book of of Genesis
[59:59] there was also another promise which was
[1:00:01] given.
[1:00:04] You see this is the one when when we
[1:00:06] talk about Christ
[1:00:09] being the royal seed of Abraham.
[1:00:12] It was of him that the prophecies were
[1:00:14] fulfilled.
[1:00:18] A prophecy which said the seed of the
[1:00:20] woman
[1:00:22] will brea the head of the serpent.
[1:00:27] So who was that one? That was Jesus. Who
[1:00:30] was he? He was the seed of the woman.
[1:00:36] We know that a woman has no seed.
[1:00:40] So what does this mean? It simply means
[1:00:43] a child that is born by a woman without
[1:00:48] the help of a man.
[1:00:51] Are you following me now? Praise the
[1:00:53] name of the Lord. Go to Genesis and get
[1:00:56] get let's let's get it there right now.
[1:01:00] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:01:02] You know the Bible is very amazing
[1:01:05] and if you get a mystery of the word
[1:01:09] you just love studying the scriptures.
[1:01:12] Look at Genesis 3
[1:01:15] vers one.
[1:01:17] Now the serpent was uh where we can read
[1:01:21] go down on to um
[1:01:32] all right this is chapter 3 uh okay and
[1:01:35] the Lord God said unto the serpent
[1:01:36] because thou okay uhhuh vers uh 15
[1:01:41] can begin from vers 14 together
[1:01:44] and the Lord God said unto the serpent
[1:01:48] Because thou hast done this,
[1:01:50] thou at cast above all cattle, and above
[1:01:53] every beast of the field, and upon thy
[1:01:56] bail shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou
[1:01:58] eat all the days of thy life,
[1:02:03] and I'll put enemity between thee and
[1:02:05] the woman,
[1:02:07] and between thy seed,
[1:02:10] and her seed. So the serpent had a sin
[1:02:15] and a woman had a would have a sin.
[1:02:20] This here was prophetic.
[1:02:24] Are you following me? He was speaking of
[1:02:26] the future.
[1:02:28] And he says, I will put enemity
[1:02:31] between thee and the woman and thy seed.
[1:02:35] Meaning the serpent seed,
[1:02:38] which means the serpent had a seed.
[1:02:42] Even today we still have serpent seed
[1:02:44] the world
[1:02:48] those who deny that they just don't
[1:02:51] understand the scripture
[1:02:54] and between her seed
[1:02:56] and between thy seed and it shall bruise
[1:02:59] thy head
[1:03:02] who the seed of the woman will bruise
[1:03:05] the serpent's
[1:03:10] Hallelujah. And thou shalt bruise his
[1:03:12] heel.
[1:03:14] So the serpet will bruise the heel of of
[1:03:17] the seed of the woman.
[1:03:22] But the seed of the woman will bruise
[1:03:25] the head of the serpent.
[1:03:28] This was a prophecy.
[1:03:30] It had to come to pass. Praise the name
[1:03:33] of the Lord. So now we see the seed of
[1:03:36] Abraham
[1:03:38] that was promised to come. Amen.
[1:03:41] According to prophecy,
[1:03:43] it would possess the gut of his enemies.
[1:03:48] Amen. And also all the nations of the
[1:03:51] earth
[1:03:52] would be blessed through the sea.
[1:03:55] Are you following me now? But now when
[1:03:58] we track down
[1:04:01] to find out where is this seed,
[1:04:04] that amen of Abraham that the whole
[1:04:08] world has been blessed through.
[1:04:11] We found out it is not Isaac.
[1:04:15] No, that is a natural seed of God.
[1:04:19] But Abraham had another seed,
[1:04:22] a spiritual seed.
[1:04:25] Amen. Amen. How was the Oh, praise the
[1:04:29] name of the Lord. How was the spiritual
[1:04:31] seed of Abraham born?
[1:04:35] by faith. Be it unto me according to
[1:04:38] your word.
[1:04:40] You remember when Mary said those words.
[1:04:44] Amen. And Abraham. We know we not see
[1:04:47] the Bible says in the book of generation
[1:04:48] of Jesus Christ the son of David.
[1:04:52] The son of Abraham. So the Bible
[1:04:54] actually calls Jesus
[1:04:56] the son of Abra.
[1:05:00] Are you following me?
[1:05:04] So we see that the seed of Abraham
[1:05:07] would possess the gate of of the enemy
[1:05:10] and the seed of the woman would bruise
[1:05:12] the head of the son. That's the same
[1:05:15] same thing he's speaking about.
[1:05:18] Jesus was the seed of the woman
[1:05:21] without a man.
[1:05:23] He did not need the instrumentality of a
[1:05:26] man
[1:05:29] for him to be born.
[1:05:31] When he reached the birth of Jesus,
[1:05:34] he said, "Jacob begott Joseph,
[1:05:38] the husband of Mary, of whom was born
[1:05:42] Jesus,
[1:05:44] who is called Christ."
[1:05:47] So, who was the father of Jesus?
[1:05:50] Certainly not Joseph. So, who is your
[1:05:53] father?
[1:05:55] Certainly not your biological father.
[1:05:58] Your biological father gives birth to
[1:06:00] this.
[1:06:02] But you see you yourself,
[1:06:06] you are not flesh and blood.
[1:06:08] You are more than flesh and blood. Amen.
[1:06:11] And your father, Amen, is the same
[1:06:14] father that begot Jesus.
[1:06:17] If that same spirit,
[1:06:20] Amen. The Lord's Christ from today dwell
[1:06:23] in you, it will quicken your mortal
[1:06:26] body. Amen. How? By the word. Amen. When
[1:06:31] we hear the word and the spirit of God
[1:06:34] comes upon us and begins to quicken us.
[1:06:37] And I tell you friends, one of these
[1:06:38] days,
[1:06:40] amen, we're going to be so quickened
[1:06:42] that we will drop these bodies and put
[1:06:45] on another body.
[1:06:47] Amen. That's what the rapture is. Amen.
[1:06:51] We have to go beyond
[1:06:54] the revelation we have now and walk into
[1:06:57] another dimension.
[1:07:00] Amen. Now let us look at this natural
[1:07:03] seed versus a supernatural seed.
[1:07:08] in a message the super sign
[1:07:11] since I have limited time I'll just do
[1:07:13] the quoting right away
[1:07:15] he says remember there was a natural
[1:07:18] seed of Abraham
[1:07:21] and a supernatural seed of Abraham
[1:07:26] the natural seed of Abraham according to
[1:07:27] Genesis 22 where we have actually read
[1:07:32] it he says thy seed shall possess the
[1:07:33] gate of Israel
[1:07:36] The natural seed of Abraham was Isaac.
[1:07:39] So through the seed of Isaac,
[1:07:42] we find that they also did possess the
[1:07:45] gates of their enemies.
[1:07:49] One time they had three of them down in
[1:07:52] Babylon.
[1:07:55] Remember,
[1:07:58] they came out of that lineage
[1:08:01] in that great big city there.
[1:08:04] that was built a super city.
[1:08:07] But they had a supernatural
[1:08:10] and they throwed them into a super fire
[1:08:14] seven times hotter than it was ever
[1:08:16] here.
[1:08:18] And there was a supernatural sign
[1:08:21] of a supernatural God standing in the
[1:08:23] fire,
[1:08:26] supernaturally saving them.
[1:08:30] What did they do?
[1:08:32] They possessed the gates of the furnace.
[1:08:36] There was another one down there named
[1:08:39] Daniel, Abraham's seed. What happened?
[1:08:43] He stayed true to God.
[1:08:46] He know that he was the seed of Abraham.
[1:08:49] He know he was doing right.
[1:08:52] They throw him into the lion's
[1:08:55] a supernatural light.
[1:08:58] An animal is afraid of light.
[1:09:01] So a supernatural light, a supernatural
[1:09:03] angel came down by a man
[1:09:07] that believed in supernatural
[1:09:10] and delivered him and he stayed all
[1:09:13] night in the lion's den
[1:09:16] and was supernaturally brought out the
[1:09:19] next morning
[1:09:22] because he believed and trusted in a
[1:09:24] supernatural God
[1:09:28] and he possessed the gates of the
[1:09:29] lionist.
[1:09:33] Oh hallelujah. Amen. But then he says,
[1:09:35] "But one day,
[1:09:37] one day they come on the supernatural
[1:09:40] scene.
[1:09:43] All these over possess the gates of
[1:09:45] their enemy
[1:09:48] because they they they believed in a
[1:09:50] supernatural God."
[1:09:53] Are you following me? But they were the
[1:09:55] natural seed of Abraham.
[1:09:58] They possessed the the gates of heaven
[1:10:02] because they believed in the
[1:10:02] supernatural.
[1:10:04] But he says, "But one day there came a
[1:10:08] supernatural seed
[1:10:15] which was born by a supernatural birth."
[1:10:20] Amen. There is something that I want us
[1:10:23] to see. You can overcome
[1:10:26] even when you are natural seed
[1:10:29] by believing in a supernatural God.
[1:10:32] How much more when you are a
[1:10:35] supernatural seed.
[1:10:38] Amen. Having born by a supernatural
[1:10:40] power
[1:10:44] there the devil can defeat you.
[1:10:49] Amen. Amen. They that are born of God,
[1:10:53] overcome the world.
[1:10:55] We are going to overcome the world.
[1:10:58] Not because we so much believe in God,
[1:11:02] but because we are born of God.
[1:11:06] They that are born of God overcome the
[1:11:09] world.
[1:11:12] So Jesus was another seed that came
[1:11:16] what? a supernatural seed
[1:11:19] which was born by a supernatural birth.
[1:11:24] Born not by a natural birth,
[1:11:27] but by a supernatural birth,
[1:11:30] by the supernatural faith which Abraham
[1:11:32] had,
[1:11:35] not according to the sexual desire of
[1:11:36] Abra
[1:11:39] and what God did to him that way,
[1:11:42] but through a supernatural faith.
[1:11:47] that he had and faith is supernatural.
[1:11:51] It does supernatural things
[1:11:54] and through Abraham's faith
[1:11:57] as he was here hundreds of years later
[1:12:02] come the supernatural seed that he
[1:12:03] believed in.
[1:12:07] And when the supernatural seed come on
[1:12:09] earth,
[1:12:13] he did a supernatural sign of a
[1:12:15] supernatural prophet.
[1:12:18] Are you following me? He was greater
[1:12:21] than a prophet.
[1:12:23] [Music]
[1:12:24] He was a God prophet
[1:12:28] to give a natural people a supernatural
[1:12:30] birth.
[1:12:34] What did he do? He went before us
[1:12:38] and died,
[1:12:40] but they couldn't hold him.
[1:12:44] Abraham's grave is still there. Isaac
[1:12:47] grave is still there, but there is an
[1:12:49] empty tomb
[1:12:51] on the supernatural scene.
[1:12:54] A supernatural work
[1:12:57] had a supernatural resurrection.
[1:13:00] We better begin to believe in something
[1:13:03] supernatural.
[1:13:07] By the way, when I see myself in a
[1:13:11] natural way, I don't see how I can be
[1:13:15] saved in any way.
[1:13:19] But when I see the supernatural God
[1:13:23] and the supernatural work he has done in
[1:13:25] me,
[1:13:27] I don't see how I can be Lord.
[1:13:30] We need to begin looking
[1:13:33] at the supernatural
[1:13:37] God in us.
[1:13:42] Let me tell you something. The purpose
[1:13:44] of this message
[1:13:46] is to make us identify who we really
[1:13:49] are,
[1:13:52] which kind of seed we are.
[1:13:56] I just pray as I labor this evening
[1:14:00] that the Lord will reveal it to you.
[1:14:04] He says what what did he do in doing it?
[1:14:10] He conquered death. He conquered hell.
[1:14:13] He conquered the grave and he possessed
[1:14:17] its gates.
[1:14:22] He rose on the third day
[1:14:25] in a supernatural resurrection.
[1:14:30] He said, "I have the keys of death and
[1:14:32] hell.
[1:14:36] I was he who was once dead and now I am
[1:14:38] alive forever more."
[1:14:41] Because I live. The seed of Abraham
[1:14:44] shall live also.
[1:14:48] There you are. So I am with you always.
[1:14:52] Even in the end of the world and the
[1:14:54] works that I do
[1:14:58] shall you also.
[1:15:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So who was
[1:15:04] Jesus?
[1:15:06] Can you follow me now?
[1:15:08] We have seen the natural lineage of
[1:15:11] Abraham
[1:15:14] and there are many on that natural
[1:15:16] lineage of Abraham
[1:15:18] that knowing their true origin.
[1:15:24] They possess the gates of their enemies
[1:15:29] from Daniel to the three Hebrew children
[1:15:32] to David to many of all these ones. They
[1:15:36] were part of that natural image. They
[1:15:39] kept possessing
[1:15:41] the gifts of their enemies. We also see
[1:15:43] the Jews who claimed
[1:15:47] to be part of the natural.
[1:15:51] But when the word came before them,
[1:15:54] they rejected him. Jesus said because
[1:15:58] you have done this you are lying. Your
[1:16:02] father is not Abra.
[1:16:04] He cannot be. You cannot be of that
[1:16:07] natural unit
[1:16:10] because everybody from that natural
[1:16:12] lineage
[1:16:14] believes in the word.
[1:16:16] So Jesus said you are lying you are of
[1:16:20] your father that you
[1:16:22] works of your father you do.
[1:16:27] And then he said but I came and he says
[1:16:31] I know who I am. That's what he was
[1:16:34] trying to say.
[1:16:35] I know who I am. I am from God. I go
[1:16:39] back to God.
[1:16:41] Jesus knew who he was. He knew he was
[1:16:44] the spiritual
[1:16:47] supernatural
[1:16:50] seed of Abraham.
[1:16:54] And he had a claim on.
[1:16:59] And in the same way, Amen. The natural
[1:17:02] seed of Abraham Excuse me continuous
[1:17:08] even today we can find them in Israel
[1:17:12] natural seed of Abraham
[1:17:14] [Music]
[1:17:16] in the same way even oh
[1:17:21] the supernatural seed
[1:17:24] of Abraham
[1:17:26] the supernatural seed of Abraham
[1:17:30] is also continuous
[1:17:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How do you know?
[1:17:38] You can trace it all the way back from
[1:17:40] at the beginning.
[1:17:43] When you see how the first one behave,
[1:17:46] then you will see all the others.
[1:17:49] They will behave the same way. They will
[1:17:52] have the same character. They will have
[1:17:54] the same life. They will have the same
[1:17:56] supernatural effect in their life.
[1:18:00] Are you following me, church? Amen. So,
[1:18:04] who was the first
[1:18:07] in this lineage?
[1:18:10] Jesus.
[1:18:11] And that's what the Bible said. He's the
[1:18:14] beginning
[1:18:15] of the new creation.
[1:18:20] Amen. Now, after him, Amen. How was he
[1:18:24] born? He was born of the word.
[1:18:28] He himself was the word made manifest.
[1:18:33] Amen. And when he was born, he was born
[1:18:36] of the word. And he came down here on
[1:18:39] earth with a purpose because he knew his
[1:18:43] true origin. He knew he came from God.
[1:18:47] He would go about to be God. He knew he
[1:18:50] was born in a supernatural way.
[1:18:54] The natural things were below him.
[1:18:57] Nothing of the word controlling.
[1:19:00] He suffered the things we suffer
[1:19:03] but he never looked at it as if it was
[1:19:07] the final verdict.
[1:19:10] He never saw anything in this world
[1:19:13] as if it spoke of his destiny.
[1:19:18] Amen. He saw the supernatural thing
[1:19:21] because that is what
[1:19:24] actually spoke of his true origin.
[1:19:28] The answer is in the seed.
[1:19:36] Hallelujah. And when he came down, he
[1:19:40] knew who he was.
[1:19:42] And because he knew who he was, he
[1:19:45] conquered death.
[1:19:47] He conquered sin.
[1:19:50] He conquered the flesh.
[1:19:53] He conquered everything.
[1:19:55] After conquering everything on earth,
[1:20:00] then there was one another enemy
[1:20:04] that was always conquering everybody.
[1:20:07] That's called death. He said, "I will go
[1:20:11] and I will die and I will conquer death
[1:20:15] so that everyone that is born in the
[1:20:19] same way that I was born will be able to
[1:20:22] conquer death."
[1:20:25] And when he conquered death, now another
[1:20:28] one, Amen, who was born of God, Apostle
[1:20:32] Paul, he writes and says, "Death, where
[1:20:36] is your sting?
[1:20:39] How could he be able to save us? Because
[1:20:42] Jesus had conquered them.
[1:20:46] Amen. A believer does not fear death.
[1:20:51] Hallelujah. If the devil scares to kill
[1:20:52] you, you tell him, "Bring it on."
[1:20:58] Let me tell you, brethren, me, I don't
[1:21:00] fear death.
[1:21:02] Whether you shoot me or you kick me or
[1:21:04] you bang on me or whatever it is, I only
[1:21:07] fear for my little children.
[1:21:10] When I go, they may suffer.
[1:21:14] But personally, when I die, I know where
[1:21:18] I am going. I don't fear death because
[1:21:22] death lost.
[1:21:26] Amen. Jesus died. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:21:30] Death lost his sting.
[1:21:34] Amen. And after he conquered death, he
[1:21:37] conquered hell also.
[1:21:39] He conquered the grave also. So let me
[1:21:42] tell you tonight, can I preach to you a
[1:21:44] little bit? There's hell and the grave
[1:21:48] have no power over a believer
[1:21:51] who is born again
[1:21:54] of the same supernatural spirit.
[1:21:59] Amen.
[1:22:00] Amen. and he possesses gates.
[1:22:05] He rose on the third day in a
[1:22:07] supernatural resurrection.
[1:22:10] We who were dead
[1:22:13] but are now many
[1:22:16] through Christ. You see, we have also
[1:22:19] resurrected.
[1:22:21] Hallelujah.
[1:22:24] I have the keys of death and holiness.
[1:22:27] Amen. I was he who was once paid.
[1:22:31] And now I am alive forever more. And
[1:22:33] because I live the seed of Abraham shall
[1:22:37] live also. Who is the seed of Abraham?
[1:22:40] They that are born of God.
[1:22:43] They that are born of the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:45] Amen. They that are born again. Born of
[1:22:48] the word shall live also.
[1:22:52] Amen. There you are. He says I am with
[1:22:55] you always
[1:22:57] even to the end of the world.
[1:23:00] and the works that I do.
[1:23:03] Oh, may God reveal this one to us.
[1:23:07] Amen. Before we go to the rapture, each
[1:23:10] of us, you want to see this portion,
[1:23:14] the works that I do, shall you also. The
[1:23:19] works that I do, the same works he did,
[1:23:22] we can do also. Amen. Talk about the
[1:23:26] life he lived.
[1:23:28] Talk about the miracles he did. Talk
[1:23:30] about the signs and wonders. Talk about
[1:23:33] the life of God.
[1:23:35] It must be made manifest
[1:23:38] in the royal seed.
[1:23:42] Amen. So this he rose again. And that's
[1:23:46] why we read Revelation 5 on Sunday
[1:23:50] because he alone is worthy.
[1:23:53] If you look again right there
[1:23:56] at Revelation 5
[1:24:01] because of time I'll read only in
[1:24:03] Luganda
[1:24:05] in English rather and I saw in the right
[1:24:07] hand of him that sat on the throne a
[1:24:09] book written within and on the backside
[1:24:11] sealed seven seals and I saw a strong
[1:24:13] angel proclaiming with a loud voice who
[1:24:14] is worthy to open the book and lose the
[1:24:16] seals thereof and no man in heaven nor
[1:24:19] in earth neither under the earth was
[1:24:20] able to open the book neither to lose
[1:24:22] the neither to look their own. And I
[1:24:24] wept much because no man was found
[1:24:27] worthy to open and to read the book,
[1:24:29] neither to look there on. And one of the
[1:24:31] elders said unto me, weep not. Behold
[1:24:34] the line of the tribe of Judah, the root
[1:24:36] of David has prevailed to open the book
[1:24:38] and to lose the seven seals thereof. And
[1:24:41] I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the
[1:24:43] throne, and the and the four beasts, and
[1:24:45] in the midst of the elders, stood a
[1:24:46] lamb, as it had been slain, having seven
[1:24:49] horns and seven eyes, which are the
[1:24:51] seven spirits sent forth into all the
[1:24:55] earth. And he came and took the book out
[1:24:59] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[1:25:01] the throne. And when he had taken the
[1:25:03] book and and the four beasts and the
[1:25:05] four and 20 elders fell down before the
[1:25:08] lamb having every one of them haps and
[1:25:11] golden vials full of orders which are
[1:25:13] the prayers of the saints and they sang
[1:25:14] a new song saying thou art worthy to
[1:25:16] take the book and to open the seals. I
[1:25:19] want you to notice those words.
[1:25:22] Thou art worthy to take the book and to
[1:25:24] open the seals there.
[1:25:27] For thou was slain and has redeemed us
[1:25:31] to God by the blood out of every kindred
[1:25:35] and nation and tongue and people
[1:25:38] and has made us unto our God kings and
[1:25:41] priest
[1:25:44] and we shall do what?
[1:25:47] Reign
[1:25:48] on the earth.
[1:25:50] He alone is worthy.
[1:25:53] He took the book and opened the seven
[1:25:56] seals.
[1:25:57] And all those
[1:25:59] whose identity was lost
[1:26:03] is now restored
[1:26:06] is now redeemed.
[1:26:08] So why did he die? Amen. in order to
[1:26:12] restore to bring back the identity of
[1:26:17] every part. Amen. Of the body
[1:26:22] of every one of those that were of the
[1:26:25] seed,
[1:26:26] the royal seed,
[1:26:29] he has restored it.
[1:26:32] And these are the ones that cannot sin.
[1:26:36] These are the ones who cannot die.
[1:26:40] These are the ones who will go in the
[1:26:41] rapture.
[1:26:43] These are the ones who are blood
[1:26:47] and perfect
[1:26:49] without spot without wrinkle wash in the
[1:26:53] blood of this lamb because the lamb was
[1:26:58] worthy
[1:27:00] of
[1:27:05] you see friends
[1:27:08] the issue was to restore the identity.
[1:27:16] Amen.
[1:27:19] I'll quickly take this portion in the
[1:27:21] bridge
[1:27:23] where the prophet says now what is this
[1:27:25] book of redemption
[1:27:28] this title did
[1:27:31] abstract title did
[1:27:33] you say abstract
[1:27:36] what does an abstract means
[1:27:40] it is searched all the way back to its
[1:27:43] beginning
[1:27:47] like that Little drop of ink this
[1:27:49] morning.
[1:27:51] When it struck that bridge bleach,
[1:27:55] it went all the way back.
[1:27:58] You remember we talked about that little
[1:28:00] drop of ink when you put in a bleach.
[1:28:03] How it completely is is disappears.
[1:28:08] And when sin has been confessed and
[1:28:10] fallen in the blood of Jesus,
[1:28:13] oh my gives an abstract
[1:28:17] Rise straight back to the creator again.
[1:28:22] And now here's the part I wanted. You
[1:28:24] become a son of God.
[1:28:28] Abstract title deed is held in the hands
[1:28:31] of the almighty.
[1:28:36] His redemption means
[1:28:39] you want to hear this portion.
[1:28:41] The redemption of this title did means
[1:28:46] all legal possession of all that was
[1:28:49] lost by Adam and Eve.
[1:29:01] Again Christian
[1:29:04] is legal possession. It is legal
[1:29:07] possession to that abstract deed
[1:29:13] title deed of eternal life.
[1:29:16] It means you possess everything
[1:29:20] that Adam and Eve lost.
[1:29:24] uh the possession of that deed.
[1:29:28] It means you possess
[1:29:31] everything that Adam and Eve are.
[1:29:35] It means you possess life.
[1:29:37] It means you possess joy.
[1:29:40] It means you possess everything you
[1:29:42] desire.
[1:29:44] Why? Because all the authority
[1:29:47] that Adam and Eve lost.
[1:29:49] You know there was a promise that the
[1:29:52] seed of the woman will come and who
[1:29:55] breathe the head of the serpent.
[1:29:58] What was it for? This seed of the woman
[1:30:01] is the royal seed of Abra.
[1:30:04] The seed of of the royal seed of Abraham
[1:30:07] we see was Jesus Christ. And we see the
[1:30:11] same lamb
[1:30:13] that was worthy to take the book out of
[1:30:17] the hand of him.
[1:30:19] on the throne
[1:30:21] and he took the book and he was worthy
[1:30:25] to open the seal. Now let me tell you
[1:30:28] something and the prophet asks a
[1:30:30] question. What does that mean? He says
[1:30:34] it means that the book of redemption.
[1:30:38] Amen. He he he alone was worth to take
[1:30:40] it and open it. And then he continues on
[1:30:44] to say what is it is the abstract title
[1:30:51] to everything
[1:30:53] that Adam lost.
[1:30:58] Hallelujah. Everything that Adam lost.
[1:31:02] What did Adam lose? Adam lost everything
[1:31:07] from power to ownership.
[1:31:10] sickness is coming
[1:31:14] and we get sick every day.
[1:31:16] We struggle every day.
[1:31:20] We we we struggle with life and things
[1:31:22] in life.
[1:31:25] Adam was not that way.
[1:31:28] Adam was perfect.
[1:31:31] Adam was in the image of God.
[1:31:34] His word could create.
[1:31:36] He could direct animals.
[1:31:39] He had power over animals.
[1:31:42] That's why the Bible says all of it, all
[1:31:43] the nature is groaning,
[1:31:46] they groaning, waiting
[1:31:49] for the sons of God
[1:31:52] to be manifested.
[1:31:54] Because when the sons of God are
[1:31:57] manifested again, then they will no
[1:32:00] longer suffer. Also
[1:32:03] when Adam lost when Adam fell he fell
[1:32:07] every everything in the human rather
[1:32:10] everything in the on the earth also
[1:32:12] became disintegrated
[1:32:18] animals like lions we were not running
[1:32:20] out from human beings
[1:32:24] but even now a hair and a chicken will
[1:32:27] run away when you try to cut
[1:32:31] You see how everything is messed up?
[1:32:35] These creatures, we are supposed to have
[1:32:37] the preeminence over them.
[1:32:40] But we don't cuz we are fallen from from
[1:32:44] our first estate.
[1:32:47] But because the lamb came and took the
[1:32:49] book of what is it? He has redeemed back
[1:32:54] and he has brought back the title deed.
[1:32:57] What is it? is the authority
[1:33:01] to everything that Adam lost.
[1:33:04] Now when we speak these things,
[1:33:07] the world thinks it's a joke.
[1:33:10] And some believers think it is a joke.
[1:33:13] But I tell you, brother, it cannot be
[1:33:16] made manifest
[1:33:18] until you personally receive a
[1:33:20] revelation of it.
[1:33:23] It is not going to be restored to a
[1:33:24] group
[1:33:27] or else even a message believer would
[1:33:28] have received it.
[1:33:31] It is going to be re amen brought back
[1:33:34] to every adopted child of God
[1:33:39] as individuals
[1:33:41] because God works with us as
[1:33:43] individuals.
[1:33:47] And this must must be even before the
[1:33:51] rapture.
[1:33:53] We have already seen it happen in the
[1:33:55] life of brother
[1:33:59] and this is how each of us must walk
[1:34:03] power and authority controlling life on
[1:34:06] earth
[1:34:08] controlling events around our life
[1:34:11] not allowing situations and events to
[1:34:14] control us.
[1:34:17] Amen. Because I will tell you something
[1:34:20] in the millennium we are going to be
[1:34:23] just like that.
[1:34:27] And everything we are going to have
[1:34:30] we potentially have now
[1:34:33] and even what has not yet manifested.
[1:34:37] It means we have not grown to that level
[1:34:39] yet
[1:34:41] but everything is already here.
[1:34:44] There is no more revelation coming.
[1:34:47] We only need to feed on the water and
[1:34:49] throw.
[1:34:52] It's just like if you tell a child, a
[1:34:54] little boy
[1:34:56] and and then you tell him, "Oh, you know
[1:34:57] what? Little boy, you have very many
[1:35:00] children."
[1:35:02] He just laugh at you.
[1:35:05] Say, "You have many children."
[1:35:09] Where do you mean that? He just doesn't
[1:35:11] know. He's young.
[1:35:14] [Music]
[1:35:15] Amen. and feed him with food every day.
[1:35:19] Every day. Every day. Amen. And soon he
[1:35:23] will become an adulant.
[1:35:25] And when he becomes an adult, the body
[1:35:28] will begin striking.
[1:35:31] He'll begin to feel certain things.
[1:35:34] Why? Because something wants to come up.
[1:35:38] Amen. Something wants to be manifested.
[1:35:40] And then soon or later, he gets married.
[1:35:44] Amen. Many children begin to
[1:35:48] brother had to tell his son.
[1:35:50] We are not the only one supposed to
[1:35:52] populate the whole.
[1:35:56] So go slow.
[1:36:00] Are you following me?
[1:36:02] But if you told a little bitty Paul
[1:36:06] that you have many children, he would
[1:36:08] have laughed. So listen to me, church.
[1:36:11] The things I'm speaking about
[1:36:14] true.
[1:36:16] If it is not yet manifested in your
[1:36:18] individual life,
[1:36:20] it doesn't mean it's not true. Just keep
[1:36:23] eating the word. Keep eating the word.
[1:36:26] And one of these glorious mornings.
[1:36:29] Amen.
[1:36:31] Without even thinking about it,
[1:36:34] you you will be in a hard situation.
[1:36:37] You will be in a tight corner.
[1:36:40] And then something will happen. Amen.
[1:36:43] whereby you realize you have some
[1:36:46] supernatural authority
[1:36:50] over situations in your life.
[1:36:53] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Who could tell
[1:36:56] brother
[1:36:57] that can stop a very big stubborn bull
[1:37:04] with just a word?
[1:37:06] Who could tell him? If they told him,
[1:37:09] would he believe it?
[1:37:12] Hallelujah.
[1:37:14] Brother Bam himself says when he walked
[1:37:16] into that place, he had forgotten to
[1:37:19] read
[1:37:21] that there is a a very angry bull here
[1:37:26] and he knew about it but he had
[1:37:29] forgotten all about it. So he found
[1:37:31] himself
[1:37:33] in a fix in a tight corner. His back
[1:37:37] against the wall
[1:37:39] and he says nowhere could he
[1:37:42] tried to run but he realized everywhere
[1:37:46] around him he could not climb over
[1:37:50] before the bull arrived where he was. So
[1:37:52] what did he do? He stood his ground and
[1:37:56] then in a moment Amen. What is it? It is
[1:38:00] a sense
[1:38:03] of a son of God. Call it godly instinct
[1:38:09] under pressure.
[1:38:12] That godly instinct, every born again
[1:38:15] son of God has it.
[1:38:21] But many times it cannot manifest until
[1:38:25] you yourself are found in a pressure.
[1:38:30] When you're in a pressure zone,
[1:38:32] you will even be surprised.
[1:38:35] Was I the one who did it?
[1:38:38] And then brother Bam in a moment he
[1:38:40] stood his ground and then a bull came
[1:38:46] and bam stood his ground and all of a
[1:38:49] sudden he felt something in his heart. A
[1:38:53] love for this animal.
[1:38:55] What was that? The Bible says God is
[1:38:58] love.
[1:39:01] Talk about a son of God that is adopted.
[1:39:06] God is love. And then out of him
[1:39:10] and he felt love for this animal. And he
[1:39:12] began to speak to Eve. Doesn't that look
[1:39:15] like Adam before the for?
[1:39:19] I'm sorry, bull. I'm really so sorry. I
[1:39:23] didn't I didn't I didn't mean to disturb
[1:39:24] you.
[1:39:25] I had forgotten everything about
[1:39:28] please
[1:39:30] do not harm me. I'm God servant
[1:39:33] and was like
[1:39:37] all right
[1:39:42] brother tell me what that is
[1:39:46] tell me what that is when a man filled
[1:39:49] with demon powers
[1:39:53] comes at brother Brham
[1:39:55] on the pull pit
[1:39:58] and he comes to to break every bone in
[1:40:00] his body in his body.
[1:40:03] That maniac he said I'll break every
[1:40:06] bone in your body
[1:40:09] and the deacons rush.
[1:40:15] I can I can right now imagine
[1:40:22] brother
[1:40:26] But as an adopted son of God,
[1:40:31] redeemed, restored, perfect
[1:40:35] said, "Leave him alone.
[1:40:38] Let him come.
[1:40:42] In a moment, he will be at my feet."
[1:40:49] How did he know? He never saw a vision.
[1:40:54] All these circumstances I'm giving you,
[1:40:57] it was not by vision.
[1:41:02] So it's not by gift.
[1:41:04] It is by identity.
[1:41:07] It is by authority and power of who you
[1:41:09] are.
[1:41:11] God reveal this to us. Hallelujah.
[1:41:16] And the man came. I break every bonding.
[1:41:22] M
[1:41:25] [Music]
[1:41:28] fell down. What happened there? What
[1:41:31] happened? What is it? It was just a
[1:41:34] moment. Brother never prayed about it.
[1:41:38] Brother never saw a vision about it. But
[1:41:41] he swung into action
[1:41:44] under that pressure as a son of God.
[1:41:49] Let me tell you brothers, sisters, the
[1:41:51] things we are preaching about,
[1:41:55] excuse me, the things we are preaching
[1:41:57] about
[1:41:59] may look sometimes as if it it is not
[1:42:01] reality.
[1:42:04] But if you receive what we're talking
[1:42:06] about,
[1:42:08] oh brother, sister, when you in a moment
[1:42:10] of a squeeze,
[1:42:13] yourself personally, pressure builds up.
[1:42:17] You will realize
[1:42:18] certain abilities you possess.
[1:42:24] Before before you could not turn down a
[1:42:26] boy,
[1:42:29] do you not turn down a guy, you don't
[1:42:32] know how to do it.
[1:42:34] But after speaking and eating the word,
[1:42:36] all of a sudden you have an experience
[1:42:38] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:42:41] Then you realize there is certain power
[1:42:45] and authority that you now possess
[1:42:49] and you wield over others,
[1:42:54] over nature.
[1:42:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:43:00] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:43:03] So these are the things I'm preaching
[1:43:04] about.
[1:43:06] The redemption means all legal
[1:43:08] possession
[1:43:11] [Music]
[1:43:12] to all that was lost by Adam.
[1:43:15] It means is restored back again.
[1:43:19] It is restored to us the church.
[1:43:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Adam could not
[1:43:26] meet the requirements of redemption
[1:43:29] after he found he was lost.
[1:43:33] He sinned and he had separated himself
[1:43:34] from God.
[1:43:36] He was on this side of the cousin.
[1:43:39] So he could not redeem it. He just
[1:43:41] couldn't. He needed redemption.
[1:43:45] But the grace of God made this kinsman
[1:43:48] redeemer
[1:43:51] in the person of Jesus Christ.
[1:43:56] Lord required it.
[1:43:58] Grace made it requirements.
[1:44:01] Oh amazing grace as sweet as
[1:44:05] God's law required an innocent
[1:44:07] substitute
[1:44:13] in a message and thy seed shall possess
[1:44:14] the gate of his enemies. Now remember
[1:44:18] thy seed shall possess the gates of his
[1:44:19] enemies.
[1:44:21] The seed shall possess.
[1:44:24] Tell your neighbor the seed shall
[1:44:25] possess.
[1:44:27] Now he's talking now of Abraham's seed.
[1:44:32] And how do we become Abraham's seed?
[1:44:35] By being dead in Christ.
[1:44:39] Colossians chapter 3. We when we were
[1:44:43] dead in Christ,
[1:44:45] we become Abraham seed also.
[1:44:50] We are dead. Oh hallelujah.
[1:44:54] Amen. Say hallelujah somebody.
[1:44:55] Hallelujah. We are dead to the things of
[1:44:58] the world
[1:44:59] and we begin a new creation
[1:45:03] in Christ Jesus. Then the Holy Spirit
[1:45:06] that was in Christ is in us
[1:45:11] and that makes us Abraham's seed
[1:45:16] and it gives us Abraham's faith.
[1:45:21] We are Abraham's seed.
[1:45:24] That means we too must possess
[1:45:28] the gates of our heaven.
[1:45:31] Hallelujah. Amen. That's why Jesus said
[1:45:34] to Peter, Amen, for thou art Peter and
[1:45:38] upon this rock, I will build my church
[1:45:42] and the gates of my
[1:45:45] hallelujah. The gates of heaven shall
[1:45:48] not prevail.
[1:45:51] And I will give unto thee the key.
[1:45:53] of the kingdom of heaven. And whatever
[1:45:55] thou shall
[1:45:57] be bound in heaven,
[1:45:59] whatever thou shalt lose
[1:46:02] shall be loo.
[1:46:04] We possess that same power
[1:46:08] to possess every gate.
[1:46:11] You see why? Why does Jesus say this?
[1:46:14] Because he knows we too like him are the
[1:46:18] seed of Abraham. So we can possess every
[1:46:21] gift.
[1:46:22] We can possess gifts.
[1:46:25] I have some people here as I'm finishing
[1:46:28] that feel like possessing some gifts.
[1:46:31] Amen. By the way, this thing is revealed
[1:46:35] to you as an individual
[1:46:39] as an individual and then you receive a
[1:46:42] revelation. There's a brother here who
[1:46:44] was sick on Sunday having joints in the
[1:46:47] in in the pain in the leg. He couldn't
[1:46:50] stand. He was sitting. But as he was
[1:46:53] hearing the word, revelation struck him.
[1:46:56] Suddenly, hey, you're a son of God, you
[1:46:59] have authority over your body. And then
[1:47:01] you know what? He he began saying,
[1:47:04] "Amen."
[1:47:05] And the pain was gone instantly. Now,
[1:47:09] let me tell you, brother, you may doubt
[1:47:11] that testimony.
[1:47:12] Don't worry, you are a doubter.
[1:47:15] But you will not doubt it if it is you
[1:47:18] experiencing a testimony.
[1:47:21] If God reveals to you that you can
[1:47:23] possess certain gifts
[1:47:26] and you you begin to bind and to lose
[1:47:28] and bind and lose,
[1:47:31] those things only happen by supernatural
[1:47:34] power
[1:47:36] that comes by supernatural revelation
[1:47:40] of who you are.
[1:47:42] Let us stand our feet. Hallelujah. We
[1:47:46] can possess the gates of our enemy. We
[1:47:50] can possess the gates of sickness.
[1:47:52] We can possess the gates of doubt. We
[1:47:55] can possess the gates of witchcraft. We
[1:47:57] can possess the gates of cancer. Amen.
[1:48:00] That has kept on coming to me. The gifts
[1:48:02] of cancer.
[1:48:03] Maybe someone who has cancer is missing.
[1:48:07] But I tell you, we have the power to
[1:48:09] possess the gifts of cancer.
[1:48:12] We can possess the gifts of fear. You
[1:48:15] know, we have the power. It has to be
[1:48:17] revealed to you as an individual.
[1:48:21] Oh hallelujah.
[1:48:23] Amen. Begin to possess now in time.
[1:48:27] Oh hallelujah.
[1:48:29] Thank you Jesus. Let me pray for those
[1:48:32] on Zoom.
[1:48:34] Maybe you are somewhere in your home or
[1:48:36] work struggling with something.
[1:48:40] There's nobody coming to pray for you.
[1:48:42] You not realize who you are now. This is
[1:48:45] later than we think.
[1:48:47] Come to a place, come to realization of
[1:48:50] who you are now, and you'll be free. And
[1:48:54] you'll be free. For they that are sons
[1:48:57] of God are born of God. And they that
[1:49:00] are born of God are free indeed. For he
[1:49:04] that a son sets free are free indeed.
[1:49:07] May God make you free right now in the
[1:49:10] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:49:12] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, thank
[1:49:15] you Jesus.
[1:49:18] Oh, I bless your name
[1:49:21] and magnify your name Lord
[1:49:24] because of your goodness
[1:49:27] and your mercies
[1:49:29] and your love
[1:49:31] is everlasting Lord.
[1:49:35] Hallelujah.
[1:49:36] Oh, I am free.
[1:49:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:49:43] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:49:47] Thank you, Father.
[1:49:51] Hallelujah, Lord.
