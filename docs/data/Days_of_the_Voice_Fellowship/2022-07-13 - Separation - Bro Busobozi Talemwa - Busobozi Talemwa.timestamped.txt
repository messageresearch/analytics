[28:38] thank you for coming
[28:46] chapter six
[29:11] we are reading from verse 1.
[29:18] and the Lord spoke unto Moses saying
[29:22] speak unto the children of Israel and
[29:25] say unto them when Ada
[29:29] and say unto them we need a man or woman
[29:33] shall separate themselves to vow a vow
[29:36] of another right
[29:39] to separate themselves unto the Lord
[29:42] he shall separate himself from wine and
[29:46] strong drink
[29:47] and shall drink no vinegar
[29:50] of wine or vinegar of strong drink
[29:53] neither shall he drink any liquor of
[29:56] grapes nor eat moist grapes or dried all
[30:01] the days of his separation shall ye eat
[30:04] nothing that is made of vine tree from
[30:07] the Cannons even to the husk all the
[30:11] days of the vow of this separation shall
[30:14] nor Reza come upon his head until the
[30:17] days be fulfilled in the which is
[30:20] separated himself unto the Lord he shall
[30:23] be holy and shall let the locks of the
[30:27] hair of his head grow
[30:30] all the days that he separated himself
[30:33] unto the Lord he shall come at no dead
[30:36] body
[30:37] he
[30:39] that shall make he shall not make
[30:42] himself unclean for his father or for
[30:45] his mother for his brother or for his
[30:48] sister when they die because the
[30:52] consecration of his God is upon his head
[31:58] foreign foreign
[32:32] amen Mina
[32:35] loving Jesus
[32:37] to you tonight
[32:41] we are not as holy as your word is
[32:49] that we might be made holy weather
[32:55] we desire that as we hear your word
[32:58] tonight
[33:01] we will be taken out of the way
[33:05] that you will speak to us and that we
[33:09] shall open our spiritual ears
[33:12] and to understand
[33:15] what the spirit of the Lord wants us
[33:21] out of my voice
[33:32] foreign
[34:15] the Bible says ask and he shall receive
[34:17] I believe
[34:25] and if you ask you shall received
[34:34] beside forgive me
[34:37] Lord we want to find you tonight
[34:55] when I saw your status I was like how
[34:57] will she come today
[35:01] you fought a good fight
[35:06] and I believe all of you have
[35:10] the Lord will give you Grace
[35:13] and this evening I'm speaking on
[35:15] separation
[35:17] I spoke on this on Wednesday
[35:23] on Wednesday 18th September 2013.
[35:31] only one person or two where
[35:34] there who are here today
[35:44] and so I thought I should uh just
[35:48] suffered inspired to speak on this
[35:49] subject again
[35:53] and uh I trust it will be a blessing to
[35:57] us
[36:03] I appreciate it that you don't miss any
[36:05] service
[36:06] um
[36:07] [Music]
[36:18] and I think that is
[36:20] recorded in heaven
[36:25] amen Amina how many happy tonight
[36:29] amen we have come here
[36:32] to hear his wife
[36:34] how many have ever separated themselves
[36:37] from something
[36:44] we all understand what separation is
[36:50] something very very interesting okay
[36:56] separation is a a must
[37:01] in life but today I want us to look at
[37:04] it in a spiritual perspective
[37:10] here in the Book of Numbers
[37:13] Moses gives the laws concerning
[37:16] separation
[37:20] I should say that the Lord spoke to
[37:22] Moses and he gave him laws concerning
[37:25] separation
[37:29] and this was also connected to a vow of
[37:33] a Nazarite
[37:37] if a woman or a man wanted to be to vow
[37:41] a vow of of being another right
[37:46] they had to separate themselves
[37:52] now we are no longer under the law of
[37:54] Moses
[37:56] but we are still under the law of God
[38:00] and the law of God is the word of God
[38:04] and if God required then for people to
[38:08] separate themselves I believe is still
[38:10] requires people now to separate
[38:12] themselves
[38:16] [Music]
[38:18] if God wanted then for people to be
[38:22] nazarites I believe even today he does
[38:30] right was a man or a woman that was
[38:33] living a consecrated life in service to
[38:36] God
[38:37] um
[38:38] [Music]
[38:42] and they did not do everything that
[38:45] everybody else did
[38:49] they were supposed to be a special group
[38:51] of people
[38:54] they were supposed to be different from
[38:56] others
[38:58] so God would give them even physical
[39:01] signs
[39:03] where people would look at them and know
[39:06] that this one is a Nazarite
[39:34] and people who are going to separate
[39:37] themselves to a consecrated life of
[39:40] service unto the Lord
[39:45] you know it's not an easy thing
[39:48] it is a difficult thing
[39:51] but you see it has its blessings that
[39:54] follow him
[39:57] is always a little uh favored from the
[40:01] Lord or by the Lord
[40:06] he goes ahead to describe how he our
[40:10] separate himself and from what
[40:14] um
[40:15] he says he will not drink wine
[40:18] he will not drink any strong drinks
[40:21] I will not drink a vinegar vinegar he
[40:25] will not you know drink that drink this
[40:28] eat peace
[40:31] it was very specific
[40:35] and he also says that even the hair now
[40:42] [Music]
[40:43] of another right and in the same way
[40:48] we don't drink or eat anything
[40:52] both physically and Also spiritually
[40:56] that's why we do not drink alcohol
[40:59] why because we are not ready
[41:05] that's why we keep our hair a certain
[41:08] ways
[41:27] and now today
[41:29] we notice in the New Testament again
[41:38] do you know that sister
[41:41] Elizabeth is not supposed to touch your
[41:43] head
[41:45] because you are not right
[41:51] today you should not look like a woman
[41:55] does not look like the rest of the world
[41:58] because you are not the right answer the
[42:01] Lord
[42:02] am I preaching to someone tonight
[42:05] and he says that all the things of that
[42:08] he separated himself unto the Lord
[42:13] shall not come to any dead body
[42:17] and he shall not take make himself and
[42:20] clean for his father or for his mother
[42:25] or for his brother when they died
[42:29] foreign
[42:51] if anybody loves their mother or their
[42:54] father or their sister or their brother
[42:56] more than Christ
[43:02] is not worthy of Christ
[43:05] you see we must love our family members
[43:09] but I must not love your family members
[43:13] more than you love price
[43:16] should be your number one priority
[43:21] not your wife not your husband sit back
[43:25] not your brother's sister Christ
[43:29] to all the decisions you're making in
[43:31] your life
[43:32] you should make Jesus Christ the
[43:35] priority Christianity
[43:40] then even if everyone else is not happy
[43:44] as long as you have made your priorities
[43:46] right
[43:49] are you following me so those were the
[43:53] rules the laws uh concerning separation
[43:56] or concerning uh being another right now
[44:04] in a mess like it shall be even as it
[44:07] was told me
[44:11] you notice we're going to bring them
[44:14] again
[44:14] Abraham slept Isaac
[44:19] Jacob they slept
[44:22] is
[44:24] are you following me tonight
[44:27] all the Patriots
[44:31] so all the the Moses they slept so much
[44:36] Elijah slept
[44:38] [Music]
[44:41] all these men slept
[44:43] but
[44:45] Christo did he sleep yeah he died yeah
[44:50] and then in here you see separation
[44:55] [Music]
[44:56] God wasn't with him
[45:02] the death of Christ God was not he died
[45:05] alone
[45:10] he had to suffer the absence of God in
[45:14] his death that we could have the
[45:16] presence of God in our days
[45:30] he said my Lord my Lord why have you for
[45:33] seconds
[45:35] says he had to suffer the absence of God
[45:39] in his death
[45:45] that we Buddha oh we would have the
[45:49] presence of God in our death I wouldn't
[45:53] Affairs
[45:56] all right now remember death means
[45:58] separation
[46:00] there got struck upon him our judgment
[46:06] and there is our judgment
[46:09] so many sins go before them and some
[46:12] follow
[46:14] [Music]
[46:30] do you want your sins to go before you
[46:34] or you want your sins to follow you oh

[46:43] let's confess hours
[47:09] [Applause]
[47:12] and Christ met our judgment Christian
[47:15] and God In the Garden of Eden when he
[47:18] pronounced straight upon the human race
[47:27] every human being
[47:30] mean separation
[47:33] that's the reason we call it death for
[47:36] one another
[47:38] we just separate from one another prayer
[47:42] now this year
[47:45] means separation
[47:47] doesn't mean to you know die is that
[47:50] death is not the end of something
[47:54] death is actually the beginning of
[47:57] something else
[48:04] means separation
[48:08] when he says the day you eat they are
[48:11] wrong thought simply you shall die
[48:17] it means that someday you will be
[48:19] separated from me
[48:26] separated from God because of sin or
[48:29] Moon
[48:34] because of Jesus Christ his death on the
[48:36] cross
[48:38] he was the bridge
[48:54] away all with separation
[48:58] he took the man who was separated from
[49:01] God
[49:03] and he brought him back again to the
[49:06] union
[49:09] death means separation
[49:12] and I'm glad that Jesus had to die
[49:16] because Jesus died our death yes
[49:22] [Music]
[49:29] Jesus died our day yes so that we could
[49:33] live his life Hallelujah
[49:39] [Music]
[49:54] in Romans chapter 6
[49:57] verse 2 says God forbid how shall we
[50:00] that are dead to sin live and no longer
[50:02] the rain oh God
[50:08] Christians must be dead people
[50:12] Christians must be separated
[50:15] a Christian means a separated
[50:20] can we continue in sin
[50:23] in unbelief of the world that the grace
[50:27] of God May abound
[50:29] he said God forbid shall we that are
[50:33] dead to sin live any longer therein
[50:38] knowing no that so many of us as we have
[50:41] baptized into Jesus Christ we have
[50:42] baptized into his death
[50:57] like as Christ was raised up from the
[51:00] dead by the glory of the father even so
[51:03] we also should walk in the newness of
[51:05] life is
[51:13] did you see that today
[51:15] means separation
[51:18] and I thought it's not the beginning of
[51:21] something at the end of something
[51:23] it's the beginning of something
[51:29] who died with him
[51:36] now we have started to work on New Life
[51:42] and every man every woman that comes to
[51:45] Jesus Christ
[51:47] they must begin to walk the newness of
[51:51] Life
[51:52] how do you all the newness of life
[51:57] you cannot unless you are dead to begin
[52:00] with a good time
[52:05] working in the newness of Life

[52:28] the dead there is no more everyone

[53:05] because I want you to see something
[53:10] praise the name of the Lord

[53:25] do you know that the scripture clearly
[53:28] says
[53:31] that the true children of God
[53:39] money
[53:42] all right let us read it
[53:50] first read first John chapter 3 verse 8.

[56:14] what are the works of the devil the
[56:17] words of the devil is unbelief
[56:21] and Jesus yes you died on the cross so
[56:25] that he can separate the children of God
[56:27] from unbelief
