[5:13] were talking about
[5:17] and those who missed the second part of
[5:19] it please look it up on the podcast
[5:53] what is your religion
[5:57] and we tell them we do not have any
[5:59] religions
[6:02] and then others wanted to know what what
[6:05] our religious affiliation was
[6:11] and we told them we do not have any
[6:13] either
[6:16] christians
[6:18] what

[7:58] baptist
[7:59] baptist because i am healing remember
[8:04] the true original baptism
[8:09] baptized in the bible
[8:24] is
[8:35] the one that will baptize in the name of
[8:36] the lord jesus christ in much water
[8:45] [Music]
[9:42] [Music]
[9:47] the faith of our original pentecostal
[9:50] father
[9:55] and i want to announce to you this
[9:57] morning
[9:58] that man already came home
[10:02] 50 years on the left now again but he
[10:05] left the message
[10:08] what is the message
[10:10] the message is that revelation which
[10:12] takes us back to the revelation of the
[10:14] bible
[10:16] praying
[11:12] a man
[11:15] god needs to use a man
[11:18] not his church
[11:21] in our generation
[11:23] god has used a man
[11:26] people always receive the man around
[11:28] tobacco
[11:31] no need never not all the time similarly
[11:33] she says does god stop using men
[11:36] directly
[11:38] always use this man
[11:40] whether some believe
[11:48] [Music]
[11:54] that will be those
[12:22] to run with that
[12:26] big denominations
[12:33] and they have no message to preach
[12:36] and i want us to look at it here in the
[12:38] type
[12:40] with the story
[12:42] of the king and absolutely
[13:03] the king david kabaka dawudi reached
[13:06] that time and now we have to come when
[13:09] his sons grew but even
[13:11] and each of them wanted to be a king
[13:13] next after him
[13:17] but we know little money it was
[13:23] only
[13:24] uh solomon
[13:28] that was to be the king after him
[13:32] so then
[13:35] [Music]
[13:46] and
[13:57] [Music]

[14:16] is our solid rock red light so when you
[14:18] enter
[14:20] the people
[14:22] can move us
[14:24] up

[16:47] so if it is
[16:48] possible please save him
[16:51] and the heart of david
[16:54] was like that of god why didn't that

[1:12:45] [Applause]
[1:13:01] [Music]
[1:13:03] souls

[1:13:06] they never heard the message
[1:13:10] they ran but without a message
[1:13:14] [Music]
[1:14:26] but the king was still patient
[1:14:31] same question
[1:14:40] the enemies

[1:15:16] [Music]
[1:15:36] was much moved here quite welcome look

[1:15:41] we are looking for people with a message
[1:15:44] which will remove people
[1:15:47] which will move souls
[1:15:49] where you have been a sinner
[1:16:18] oh
[1:16:21] [Music]
[1:16:58] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[1:17:00] and the scene which does so easily beset
[1:17:03] us and let us run with patience the rest
[1:17:05] that is set before us
[1:17:07] looking unto jesus the author and the
[1:17:08] finish of our faith who for the joy that
[1:17:10] was set before him and you are the cross
[1:17:13] despising the shame and he sat down at
[1:17:15] the right hand of the throne of god
[1:17:23] [Music]
[1:17:56] some questions here this morning
[1:18:01] let us run
[1:18:03] okay you see we are compassed with a
[1:18:04] great crowd of witnesses
[1:18:07] did you know there are many around us
[1:18:09] this morning church oh my god my
[1:18:37] is
[1:18:55] [Music]
[1:19:48] what way
[1:20:02] tree which suddenly which that so easily
[1:20:06] beset us
[1:20:12] aside
[1:20:14] later this morning
[1:20:16] let
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:21:40] okay hallelujah amen oh my tell somebody
[1:21:45] else
[1:21:46] for the hour to do who are we looking at

[1:23:05] i
[1:23:08] if you have a dollar
[1:23:10] and i say is this a good dollar
[1:23:15] and you look at it and it would have to
[1:23:17] look pretty much like a real dollar or
[1:23:19] you wouldn't believe it
[1:23:25] so
[1:23:26] it will have to be a real good imitation
[1:23:29] [Music]
[1:23:31] and if jesus said that the two spirits
[1:23:33] in the last days that would be so close
[1:23:35] to you it would deceive the very
[1:23:36] election yes
[1:23:44] religious people
[1:23:46] now remember now there are there ain't
[1:23:48] nothing out there in them old cold for
[1:23:51] more outside
[1:23:57] it's talking about those kind of
[1:23:58] religions they have just a form of
[1:24:05] but these two spirits are a real
[1:24:07] spirits it would be so close to you it
[1:24:09] would receive the video like
[1:24:14] somebody
[1:24:42] i've told you before yes
[1:24:45] i want to ask you this morning
[1:24:52] jesus said
[1:24:54] if
[1:24:55] it is
[1:25:07] what does it mean
[1:25:08] it is
[1:25:17] [Music]
[1:25:24] it will
[1:25:46] [Music]
[1:26:02] listen which you receive because you
