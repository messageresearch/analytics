back amen today we were supposed to have Pastor Gideon but we we did this program long long ways away uh but in the middle there then he lost his associate pastor actually his associate was also my best man on my wedding kind ofos associated with my family so uh I then contacted him and asked him will you still come he said yeah it's difficult but I will keep my word and then yesterday night he contacted me and said there is a pastor friend of his from from some place in Kenya he traveled with his wife the church and they came to you know uh Comfort them during this time and also the church because of their loss so he said it would look uh not good for him to now leave them yet they have come because of him so he explained to me it took some time to explain to me and he said he felt bad about it uh I I was already feeling bad about it too and I told I will explain he requested me explain to the church on my behalf I hope they will understand he said I believe they will understand and he said we would push it for the next Sunday the Lord will how many understand that thank you for that so that is um but before he had called me the spirit had spoken to me usually every weekend there's a way he speaks to me gives me an inspiration that I'm supposed to speak on so I already got the inspiration so I thought well it's not for this weekend so I filed it away but he was telling for this week so that's what I will speak on this morning I know we have a brother Ephraim we would have wanted he spoke to us on Wednesday but that was so late for me to uh to attack you that we hours of the night until you ministering in the morning but I'm so happy brother ephra you're here with us your wife how many appreciated brother on wednes and we are doing his interview on the bench uh tomorrow because on Tuesday he's flying out with his back to Ethiopia and so before they go he has desired and I have desired that we do that bench interview I'm sure it will be wonderful his testimony how he came into the message and um you know how he came into the ministry and what the Lord is doing in his ministry in that will inspire many it will also encourage you to pray for them amen we have H A not here from the Deacon and also I understand Dr says be cautious to wash your hands frequently with with [Music] soap tou your eyes to prevent viral which is called r eye you don't

more people that needed to give a short testimony sister Joan also brother sh and his wife I'm going to call Sister Joan first and his wife shall now go to the uh while sister Joan is coming i' would like to re to remind you about brother Isaac's upcoming wedding yeah the other one is out another one is coming when that one is out watch out for another one so I mean when the year was beginning you know I was led by the Holy Spirit to ask all those young people that wanted weddings this year I said specifically this year they stood up we prayed together and uh some of those are the ones that we are seeing now waiting and others who also stood up also believe for yours believe for yours I mean when you are asking from God you ask for impossible things he he specializes in things he can do what no other can that's what our God does and so brother is having his wedding when June July brother it is your wedding shout July 20th July I understand they have Arrangements going on as a pastor I just want to encourage you to support support whoever comes up and they doing a right thing amen uh sister if you could please come you have another microphone God bless you church I'm sister Jo I would like to thank the Lord so much he has really been good um I it was last year but one that my told me to go back to school to Pur aach in Pharmacy di so there were only three unties in Uganda and I tried M with all that I can and my spirit didn't lead me to go the other side so there was a university that was coming up so I decided to apply there I got all the savings that I had worked for for the two years I put it there and my uncle only sent me one M but I believe God was like these people are going to do it because they promise us like by the like by the end of that year last year like uh around like uh um November they would have accredited the cause and we will be pursuing the real the real the real thing that we are supposed to do amen amen amen okay so it failed and my uncle withdrew they left me alone in it it's not easy to pay tution I had to work I had to live now working full time and I come to part timing to pay rent it was they started discouraging us sending letters flying all over social media that they should close they should close CA because it's not they actually wanted to take the school to court we were so discouraged would we were so discouraged you couldn't even tell people you in school not accredited I kept praying I kept beli I I said I'm going to risk with Jesus but I thank God so much was and even for those who want to come you can apply town you can you know it's actually a very good University you can work and study and study bless when sister Joan told us my wife and I about it was one of our points but we encouraged her to pray and I know she's been even sometimes staying back at church praying but let me tell you God answers prayer because now her course has been accredited she's going to continue I've heard sister also giving a testimony the moment I knew that that was a need I wish I had the money I would have given it but I did not I simply prayed I've been praying over that and I'm so glad to hear that God

you only have that kind of thing once and that's it give them some little time so I also would like to appreciate the dvf family of course this I always say a church of younger people and there are still many other young people who are not yet married usually that's how churches start if they are to be organic you are The Interpreter find the [Music] [Music] word well but they organic okay that's you start from you know get young people who sinful in the church under the word the word wases themes them and sets them on a c in life path of life and you know they get married you know there's a time when the church is only young people on fire for God serving God and then after that now comes in get married after that comes another seon babies babies everywhere after that season you know now they are grown and so there are many churches which are Beyond us here ATF we still here we are young and gr and I've been there before in Ethiopia and we went through some of those stages it's never easy I remember when time came for babies in Ethiopia e ah you know the brothers who were acting as deacons they were very tough but I remember this brother who was acting as Aon was married but not with a baby yet my baby is Elizabeth and and were very young and especially Elizabeth used to make a lot of noise and so this brother would be very angry but later on when he got babies I notic he very gentle with them I mean we go through stages and we here at dvf are going through those stages now thees we will get to that certain level but we I know we have also older mothers and who are behind to support I think it's a wonderful thing happen you know we are raising a generation of younger people that are going to be the pillars of the word in the Next Generation not only in our church family here but also outside in other places other local sometimes they move for work you know and you find that another church has been started somewh sometimes they move to another country but whatever it is we are raising a generation that is going to heaven you want to be a part of it so God will bless you and you should always stick with one another support one of

amen amen amen we just go into the word this morning second Timothy Chapter [Music] 2 God bless [Music] sister gud traveled to uh ah I forget the name of the place but to the east she informed me and I know she's with us and brother Daniel also Trav to Ginger so this two just informed me so we are reading second Timothy 2: we are reading vers 16 to 19 but Shan profane and vain bubblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness and their word will eat as dth a coner of whom is himas and Filas who concerning the truth have errored saying that the resurrection is passed already and overthrow the faith of some nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity for amen we also take Isaiah 495 can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yeah they may forget yet will I not forget thee behold I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me [Music] amen amen amen you may be seated I'm speaking on the Lord knowth them that are his the Lord knoweth them that are and I'm taking that out of verse 19 where he says nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity amen and I know the Saints in usually fellowship with us on why ours to you so now I want us to First Look at verse 16 there where he says sh profane and vain bubblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness [Music] you know when it comes to uh Christianity it is an exclusive Community I want to say a few direct statements today this morning and so I want you to give me your undivided attention not an inclusive community is [Music] exclusive actually you cannot be a Christian until you accept to separate yourself from the rest of the people are they evil they may not be evil but the issue is they do not believe and when you believe automatically from that moment you are supposed to be separate you are supposed to be different you are supposed to you know be the standard you know the world is bleeding you know when you see things that are happening in the world it's more so in our generation you know people are taking the name of God in vain you know you find a person that you thought ah maybe this one is ways into the world maybe because of their looks or because of their evil speech and then you approach them to reach out and give them Christ and then they will tell you so really you wonder who is not loc these days but are they in their work in their words but their works are ways away from what they confessing to be but God is raising a generation people who are going to leave talk this word will come and live in them that is why when we come to church we are not coming here to do entertainment you know because it's not entertainment that will bring us into the image of Christ we come here every day to hear the word the word receive the word that we cannot become the word so it it comes to a place where you have to accept to be separated to be separate separate from Evil thoughts separate from the scoffers the other time we talked about the scoffers you know there will be scoffers in the end time don't believe what you believe but they laugh at you for what you believe but now this morning I'm speaking about being separated because we cannot serve anybody you know sometimes you cling on to a friend you know I've seen even people Brothers I know a few here that have come to me keeping friends with the world for one year 2 3 and you will ask them why and they would say I'm trying to attract them to Christ but the longer they stay with them the longer they get dragged into the world so you wonder who is changing who if someone is in a ditch and you're pulling them out who is likely to fall come on the one who is up that's why when a brother falls into temptation the Bible says yes we help them not everyone should help those who are spiritual but also taking care of themselves unless they fall so you see they keep you know pulling one year two years pulling p and the more you pulling the more you are going down you you will be down so the Bible then talks about separation the more Cain rather the more you know Abraham went with Lord the longer he went with him the more God was let me tell you Christianity is not a and it's not it's not a religion they are not words it's a life and let me tell you there is no denomination in the world today that has the grace toher us into the life and I'll give you the answer why because they have exchanged the word of God for entertainment have exch people think they literally go to church to be made Rich that they go to receive you know you know the man of God will say yes then you give gives you we are receiving the more they receive the more their pastors will become rich and the more the people will become poor the more they they stay in the church so we have changed the purpose of church what is the purpose of church the purpose of church is to go so that we can be brought closer to God so that we can be change but that comes only by one thing by the word not even by song singing Only creates an atmosphere and that's why the message of the hour is the only hope in our generation the message of the hour is the only light in the mid of Darkness that's why we left our denomination that's why you were catholic but but you are here are you here this morning you come why didn't you remain in your denomination you must have been orthodox been Muslim been all these things religions they are good in that they teach good behavior but we left because we needed something more than religion we left because we wanted something that can take us to heaven we are here because we are hungry for the world how many are angry for the word hry for the word we are tired of games we are tired of just singing We are tired of crying but without the life why we are here not only to hear we are here Chang and if this message cannot change you then there is a problem with your seed because this message amen is a seed itself and it comes and amen contract your SE and then you begin to realize you and when you realize your NE begin toire to be closed upon to be closed upon and let me tell you we have another body amen when this one is dissolved we have another body waiting but the only thing that can make us get connected to our spiritual is the word of God let me tell you before we even born we have our spiritual bodies in the presence of God theop when we coming down here we bypassed our theop we bypassed it and came straight into this body ofh this sinful body but since we had the word we been having hunger we been having a desire something more amen and the moment we had the word we received the word I I would read for you that later he says we heard from our Fe we got connected to our spiritual so even when you say Amen it's not the body saying that inside of you whiches to go and friends that's why the Bible says sh profane and vain bubbling there are people who have made it a job joke around and you know did you know that every word you speak every ID word you will give account for it every ID word you give an in Titus 3:9 it says but avoid foolish questions and and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law for they are unprofitable and [Music] vain I always love sharing the word with people and you know sometimes you have to labor for hours showing something the truth of scripture but there are some people that you can begin to talk to and they just you know they uh they just strive with you they contend with you and they pull and they push such questions the Bible calls them foolish questions contention striving against the word he says that is unprofitable and usually the moment I see someone is is just contending I close my because whatever is going to come out is unprofitable v a man that is a after now you can read verse 10 a man that istic after the first and second admonition reject Hallelujah he didn't he didn't say you know Don't Preach to someone who is likely to reject the [Music] word that's why I believe that everyone is a potential believer even someone in a bar even a prostitute one time in Ethiopia we preached to a prute we did not know she would believe and you know how we met her we met at a post of Duty on with my brother Paul from and we did not know that she was atit but it turned out she was atit me I began shaking because i' never exp but Paul had been in that kind of life before that's why I told him I told him brother approach and then we can see how to go about so he talked to her for a while and then it brought it to an atmosphere where we now made an appointment with her so we went and she came to appointment in our place where we're living but before she could come we invited our sister yod to come y came she came in that room and and we told her everything what had happened she said I don't I love sister because she's all G she said we ready for so when she came you know she was all dressed up and you know walking like so as she was walking in she was shocked to see I was there was there and that did not Shock her much but what shocked her more was she saw Bibles and they were all open we were ready for her and as soon as she sat down she came with a different mindset but as soon as she sat down we began opening the scriptures bringing Christ to her we did not care about her situation we just began going into the word word the word the word friend doesn't matter how your situation is just come and sit under the word the word has power power to change the violence the power I don't know I cannot describe the power of the word in the next few moments she began crying what was that let me tell you friend you have a soul the word will Smite your soul the word will condemn you and then convict you and then you will confess and then you will repent and then you'll be made holy hallelujah amen and as she began crying she said I don't know what to do because for 10 years all I have known to do is prostitution what can I do now the only thing I can do meaning I don't know how to leave it I but I don't know how and she said even if I tried I know I couldn't I don't want to play with the blood of God and I told her oh sister don't worry we went to the word again not by power by by my say the Lord brother sister don't you worry about what you have done the blood of Jesus will cover your sins don't you worry about your ability all you need is your Fai just believe it and then the word of God will go to work amen she began crying crying tears were flowing and then she said I have believed I have decided I want to be baptized Hallelujah for the first time in my life I saw a prostitute being baptized I saw a prostitute CH I'm telling you today you may be a prostitute you may even be worse you may be even less I don't care the word of God the amen hallelujah hallelujah just sit under that word you know I believe anyone can be saved everyone can be we are not sent out to go and check who will believe we are sent to give the word amen even God came down and he told Kan understand do you know ACC to the serpent seed can't be saved he doesn't have a seed ofel did God preach to he didn't come down tearing him saying oh you who are going to no he told him son don't you know if you do well you will be accepted do you think God was lying God always does not what am I saying the word of God always gives a benefit of Doubt to anyone and everyone amen having this hope that the word of God has power to the word of God has power to redeem all through that amen God knows those that are his Hallelujah but we don't know so what do we do we cast a net and then God brings them but you see there are others who just have foolish questions come to but the Bible says to a after the first admon and second if they don't believe and they begin contending with you he says then reject knowing that he that is such is [Music] subverted are you hearing me Church it means stabilized corrupt Hees the power and authority of the world is subverted and being condemned of himself can you imagine God gives Grace but the grace he gives he gives it to such as would receive it he says for God so Lov the world that he gave his only begotten son whoever does what should not perish but shall have everlasting life he says after you preach with them the first time they have refused the second time refused those rejected may God never reject me may God never reject me let me he let me believe at my first time hearing of the word first Timothy 6:26 oh Timothy keep that which is committed to thy trust avoid profane and Vain bubblings and oppositions of science falsely soall can you imagine what apost Paul is saying to Timothy he says you have been given something in your trust the word of God is a sacred trust that God has given to us this is more than religion this is more than our culture it's more than our understanding it doesn't matter whether you are from the poorest of the poor from the richest of the rich or whether you're from the Royal Family or whether you from the purpose the word of God goes beyond all time the word of God is here to set a new generation of the people of God who are going to inherit this earth that is why the word of God has to change our mind to renew our mind it some people call it brainwashing let me tell you brother I need some brainwashing from the world I need a word to wash my brain I need a word to cleanse my brain not only that but I also want some soul worship let me be wased Lord I give myself to you Lord and then when you do that you'll be called a fool a fo for who Christ that is what I want glory to God the word of God has been committed to our trust God has trusted us oh help me preach this this morning God has trusted us with the word this word amen has power this word isow glorious is special is powerful the Bible says Cuts even to separate so and spirit is so sharp Shar than two so it it can cut sin away from you this powerful thing God has given it to you and God has trusted you God has oh hallelujah amen he has trusted you with this word and therefore he said brother sister avoid any profane and vain bubblings don't let anybody bre down this word don't let anybody this word it is important if God said it is important the Bible says in his word free fornication is that important is that important the word of God said women shall not wear that which pertain unto sister is that important don't let anyone tell you it's okay to wear trousers is not okay because God said soan and Ving praise God if the prophet of God said that if you see a woman making up with all these kind of things that she is like Jezebel and Jezebel was fed to dog and actually the prophet used Words which were so powerful which would even preachers fear to say he says call that kind of woman how do you do Pastor I want to leave now I'm sorry I was cting the prophet his name is williami Bram we have been entrusted by that do you mean we don't believe in makeup sah never made up never made up did was fed to the do because she was a woman of bad character why do you pick on women because women are the type of the church we all are one woman we are the bride of Christ the woman is the image of the man woman shows the the man he says don't you worry no matter what a man says he is you may come here and B to be a man of God to be anointed he said if you see what you married see what he married today can come here and say praise God let us see his wife is she image of Christ then shame is a Believer and will come and say bless you wait let sit behind you who is your wife you very Spirit Hallelujah Pastor you very hard preing don't you worry look at my wife if my wife is not fitting this word then don't hear me because I am lying to you me myself not change let me tell you brother the wife that's say is the second best gift to Salvation that's why the devil has come to the woman from the very beginning to try and defile her so that he can defile the whole human race and that's why today by this message of the hour God has measured on a woman when a woman is changed a generation is going to the devil came to a woman and destroyed her and destroyed the whole human because of every sickness it was because of the woman every sickness every fear death because of what the devil did to the woman but I want to say praise God came down again and he came to what woman and her name was her name was Mary Mary Hallelujah when the angel of the Lord came down blessed are you woman among all women why did God come to a woman because the devil came to a woman God wanted to show the devil you came to a woman and destroyed everything I am coming to a woman resurrect everything Hallelujah and out of one woman everyone in the world has known salvation that's why the end time church WIll major on the woman pauled on a woman and even many preachers in the in the secular World they don't like Paul they say Paul was always speaking on women but let me tell you if you want to know the spiritual state of the church look at the sister in the church if you see them wearing this long whatever their nails cutting off the h brother run there's a problem with that church there is a problem with that church but when you see women who are Godly women who are virtuous women then it means that church is receiving the word I wish I had time to give you a scripture for whatever I'm saying praise God and that's why even the men in the world they come in the Church of the message Bel to try and trap some sister so they can marry them and then they run away they show their true colors because they know we have the real deal and we are not ashamed to say that that's why all Pastors in the message protective of their because we know there are many Wes out there thank God for this message thank God for this message he has trusted us with it he has committed to that to our trust and he said avoid avoid profane and Vain bubblings and oppositions of F soal they say they know a lot and so they are speaking to you what they don't know I don't care what you have read you may have finished your PhD but if I know the word I still know more than you know because to know him is life there is nothing you can study and know and then you go beyond the word of God nothing until today there is no person who has studed geometry to the extent that he can rebuild the Great Pyramid of Giza no one the Great Pyramid of giz one time we'll talk about it here no one knows what who build but God sent a prophet in our generation brother William he said it is Enoch who built it Enoch was the seven from Adam he built that pyramid and he says whoever built it was perfect inry is buth and and every measurement there is perfect and no they can't rebuild who gave him the wisdom who gave him the knowledge did and he says those Vain and profane bubblings they try to ridicule and talk down the world as if to say they have something else to guide their life our Compass is the word of God imagine if you were in a forest somewhere and you're lost you don't know where to go but as a good uh you know uh person that knows how to take those trips Explorer let me say that you should have a campass with many explorers that came to Africa they had a compass with them because they then they did not know where to go and where not to go they know that Europe is here Africa is here and so they would read on the campus how many know a campus okay it shows that this is North this is East W I have a campass here I don't know how many can see this praise the name of the Lord so this is a compass praise God where is West can someone show me where West is you don't know you're not sure but when you have a campus it will show it will show but the will be even when you think something the camp will correct you must be able to read it you must know how to read one time there is a man who was reading it called the Ethiopian un and a man came to him called Philip do you know what you reading do you understand he said how can I understand without someone to interpret and he began from that very scripture to preach to him on Christ and that very day that Ethiopian man was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what happened someone read a campus for God sends us prophets that's why we need them so we can understand the word of God the word of God is the compass the word of God is our filter friend don't let your education be a filter don't let your knowledge that you have gathered from whever be your filter they have been great men in this world but they are now no more men like Alexander the Great there are now no more men like Hitler there are now no more men like the Emperors of Rome no but the word of God abides forever let the word of God be your compass let the word of God be the filter by which you think by which you act by which you do your things in life oh friends listen to me whatever you are doing ask yourself what does the word of God say if you don't do that you are blind you are blind you do not know the Bible says in people would be blind but they wouldn't know but he would send send amen clothing he would send what is this it is the end time message the message of the cross the message of Salvation the message that has revealed to us Christ Jesus in our day he says those people who thought they were wise some professing that they have errored they have errored concerning the look at tius 13 this witness is true where rebuke them sharply that they may be sound in the faith and forgive us sometimes when we preach as if it's a rebuke a sharp rebuke sometimes it is necessary it says not giving he to Jewish fees and Commandments of men that turn from the truth they turn from the truth go to the fables and Comm that's why talking about culture culture is good problem but where culture goes against the word that's a are we are the people we are we are royal priesthood now let me tell you always filter everything by the word always if your culture tells you to do this and [Music] this before you do it don't say no problem let me do it wait what does the word of if you're not sure ask ask call your pastor call Aon call call Minister what does the word of say about this they have gone to I don't even know how it is in English to finish because it is a cultural term to bust death how many not busting about busting I'm directly translating because I don't know but really when you go into the what they mean they mean busting finishing death removing death out of the so when someone dies they now have to have a special ceremony to go and abuse death and and and and then to really cast it out with some rituals with some whatever and you find believer also being a part of that shame on you what does the word of God say death is a weapon of God death is a donkey that God allows to come will be here for until the purpose of God has been death will be here no one can take it away and I can tell them they can go bursting death in their but the people will continue dying you see that culture is deceiving but for us Believers when a brother we we are sad in that we have lost them we weep in that we are no longer with them but we know this one thing the Bible says please that in the sight of God the death of his saintsall sir when a brother died we know this one thing we have another body waiting has gone beyond he has gone before us and we are going to meet him we are going to meet her because death only means separation so we not going to go busting death speaking evil words and vever should never be found in that if you have been going to bust those days may God forgive you don't go back when they call you tell I am Saed amen hallelujah they have called you that you go and dance you brother what is wrong with there is no problem with but the things around they are the ones with a problem you putting on almost NE all the breasts are out the Sid are out you a brother you make men over you sister Bible says the one who does that he has committed adultery with you brother dancing now for that there are certain things we choose not to do not because they are because when you put them in the mirror of they don't pass say I won't go there you say I won't do that praise the name of the Lord some young man asked me yesterday Pastor is it bad to go to the chrisan go to the beach is itad to go to the I'm asking is it bad to go to the beach it is not bad if the Lord gives me some money I will go with my wife and my children now the holy rers are now are you foreign okay listen why why don't we usually go to such places why don't we intentionally don't go there why don't we go swiming in such places such public places somebody's naked she's not your wife somebody's wife naked there even you brother remove come to the beach even God knows eating life you put your you put your bars outside all the BS all cracked they look weird you have gone you fall into the water with somebody's wife and even some other person's wife what do you mean in your your Consciousness your understanding don't you feel judgment if you don't feel condemned you have another Spirit it is not the spirit of God is word but the spirit of the Bible will tell you that is wrong that is wrong that is wrong that is why we don't go in such things the day I took my wife another people to swim we went in a private place because we don't believe in exposing our naked bodies to others believe that if you are with me say Amen everything we do we must look into the word and we filter that we have to filter everything we are doing what does the word say am I safe am I pleasing God I can Paul actually said all things are lawful to me there's no problem there's no problem with swimming there's no problem with enjoying a be problem enjoying nature with riding a hor whatever you are doing you have to ensure it is not questionable he said all things are lawful but all things are not expedience I'm not expedient meaning I don't have to do all it's not a question of is it okay a question of does it please the Lord these are things why I'm speaking of them that usually cause people to you know talk Vain and bubbling finding don't do that when someone begins to do that just walk away you have your Revelation it is a trust God has given to keep it keep it we entrusted by it praise God some people have asked questions is it okay to drink is it a sin to drink can I believe I drink alcohol now I see all of you looking at me when someone said no alcohol is bad but wine is okay where is that in the scripture if it is an don't know what is it English it's called what if it is alcoholic it will make you drunk and when you are drunk you become a fool the Bible actually says hell is made for such people the drunkards did you know that the revilers the drunkard and all the the abusers themselves with Mankind and things like that hell is for such people so then the Bible does not out say it is a sin to drink and so if you want to look for that you will never find it in the scripture why because in the New Testament is no longer a book of rules we are not here to obey rules oh now pastor joined your church give me a list of rules I should we have no law but love we have no rules here we just love one another and love God and love his word so there is no list of rules whatever you do ask yourself is it giving God glory so Pastor if I drink alcohol I get joy and the Bible tells me to have joy don't you see now I'm giving God the glory that is why what the Bible talked about he called it this way he said that and oppositions of science fely soal I think in your Bible science called it okay read it in 1 Timothy 6 vers verse 20 right there praise the name of the Lord so there is you know it's oppositions of science for soal read it again get it yes oppositions of science fely soal yes they think they know they think they have what they're talking they know what they're talking about but it is false because they don't know what they're talking about so now the the true Joy of a Believer does not come by alcohol true Joy of a believer come by the Holy Ghost when you receive the Holy Spirit you get drunk that is why I don't believe in being you know zero temperature of the Holy Spirit when I'm in a church that is cold and form touch I was once in my denomination but now I can't imagine there for I can't imagine sitting in a service where where there is no noise where there's no shouting in the Holy Ghost I can't imagine that because the moment I receive the Holy Ghost I took a do of the Holy Ghost and I got drunk drunk that's why whenever hear whenever hear the word I feel excited something from within me amen begins to shake begin to run up and down and I can't help it but to shout but to be happy but to sing but to dance what is it I am drunk we are drunk on the day of Pentecost amen they came down and they said look at them why are they drunk the morning and Peter came out he said man and Breen these ones are not drunk with wine they are not drunk with alcohol they are not drun but they are drun of the Holy Ghost you can be drunk of the Holy Ghost you come to church for the first day you are Qui you come for the second day you are silent you come for the third day and then you receive something and then all of the sudden your silence disappears people begin to wonder so and so was the most quiet person in the what happened to him he got drunk I remember when brother Andrew told me the other day I don't know what happened to me I was just worshiping and then all of a sudden up up up up what happened to me he got drunk father when you receive that do of the Holy Ghost you receive the joy of the Lord amen you that has been sad your sadness will fly away you that has been downcast you feel the joy of the lording in your soul what we have is not just a religion it is more than a religion it is the Holy Ghost it is fire when he comes upon you he makes a real man a real woman out of you hallelujah amen you that was a sin you begin leaving your praise the name of the Lord oh my my my I love this message turn to your neighbor tell them I love this message praise God those vain bubblings is this good is this bad is this tell them suit yourself here is what the word of God says I believe it sett it they profess that they know God but in in Works they deny him being [Music] abominable read it read it Titus 1 16 for my God they are abominable see they disobedient they deny Christ in their Works they disobedient and and very good work repr now I wanted to hear what OT in his commentary says on this shining of profan and vain bubblings it says in strong contrast to the conduct just urged on the Workman of God do thou or withdraw thyself from vain bubblings the word rendered Shan is a strong one and signifies literally to make a suir so as to avoid or as Al paraphrases it the meaning seems to come from a number of persons falling back from an [Music] object an of fear or an of and standing at a distance around for they will increase unto more ungodliness those ve bubblings better translated for the will advance un they will increase the tendency of these useless discussions and Idol disputes is to lead men into Vain and pro and profitless speculations you know you find some people people friends when you are together especially you young people you know because we have social media social media has done a lot to advance the gospel but it has also killed our generation in many ways you find people you know seeing things there and they get entertained by to an extent they begin sharing it on their own citiz you see people have no filter at all there are some things that if I'm scrolling on my social media that I see someone posting things I I will see it once and block them social Med like Facebook I left it it is vain it is profane when you see it's it's not adding to me is advancing more ungodliness and if you have friends whenever you meet they just jesting and laughing and things that you have no filter I believe we should have a filter of the world we should be different we should be the S of the earth whereby people see us and they see something different they hear something that is what is called the bride of Christ we have something we Ed he says here in questions and answers let your yes be yes and your no be no for anything more than this will come to sin you are not supposed even to joke and cut up with one another is talking about of will make you give an account for every ID word that you speak we believe that the bible say that you will have to give an account for every ID what kind of a people we to be people that is Frank people that are St people that are loving people that are kind and never listen to this never a bunch of nonsense hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we should never be a bunch of nonsense friend some of you will should live here and separate yourself from some of this Prof and V separate yourself from things and people that bring you into more ungodliness why don't we see God in our M because of the atmosphere we live in you see the results of vain and profan bubblings say they word oh my God they error concerning the truth they they even bring false doctrines the resurrection is past and they overthrow the faith of some so many people are no longer believing the message we even have some people who begin to come on social media and say why I left the message me I don't listen to such people I don't I don't I know what I believe I I know what it has done for me when I see you telling me why you left that's a very and profan I sh I stay away from it I don't want to increase myself into more because I know who I am and you find yourself taking time and then you see some of these people coming to church asking question you know someone can ask a question this one is growing in the spirit another ask a question later on I st them apart what are you eating what are you they eating from and then you find person is telling you you know there is this website I've beening [Music] he says it overthrows the faith of s why do we come to church we come to church to learn the word of God and this doesn't happen in a day it's a process you need to patiently submit yourself to the alar of the word I had people who wanted to know who William Bram is and they decid to go on the internet who is William that's a big mistake if you want to know me don't go around and asking you're

will know whether he was a prophet or he was a li some of us who have listened to it we have been convinced he a prophet of God for our generation we have been convinced his message has taken us back again to the principles of the world we have been convinced don't listen to people's opinion for yourself praise the name of the Lord you see time comes when we have to take a corner and we we we talk about things that are maturing us right we need to grow in the Lord in Christ in the knowledge of his word see the word of God is Not subject for debate to be ready to receive it all Let It mold your character the character of God in you whatever the word of God says you say you say now when the word of God says I I talked about it's an Abomination for a woman to wear a man gar or a man to wear that which a woman now is that is that Amen in the church is it amen at home is it a at work is it a everywhere we go it is aen believe it we don't say we dress as a Believer when we are going to church and when we are going to work you know Pastor me I'm educated I have a very sophisticated job we have some avors here of them and you know in our job you cannot dress something Bel you are a Believer you know me I don't like Christians don't put on many clothings Hallelujah I have a back to say this maybe the next few years we can't be able to speak like but now if we have speak like because I know what I'm doing I'm not I'm not I'm not picking on the old people those are old it's difficult to change them I'm picking on you younger people you are young and you you can correct yourselves now so that you can also bring forth a generation of people that also will correct their children we ought to have people who will stand for the word baptism should be done in much water and only in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ is that a man now that cannot change it doesn't matter if you were baptized if you were not baptized in much water then you need to be re baptized even if you were baptized in much water but not in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you need to redo it again father son Holy Ghost is not a name the name is the Lord Jesus Christ amen At The Mention Of The Name of Jesus every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord so if you're not baptized like that come ask us we shall baptize you for free no payment Jesus Paid It All We Say Amen others will be de and cont Bop forget about your Bishop take what the word of God say secure your soul there is only one Lord God not two or three they believe inom 6 says that is is speaking about the one Lord God Israel the Lord your God is one Lord Lord he's talking about the old test Jehovah Lord okay who is Jesus Jesus is wait Jehovah of the Old Testament is who Lord how many believe that deom 64 and Jesus also is how many lords do you have if he one Lord what does that mean it means jeh of the Old Testament became Jesus of the New Testament Jesus and Jehovah is anonymous it means the same one talking about same God God put on flesh and came and was manifested among us so I said Jesus Is God and say don't believe the trity ofs if at all we believe in the Trinity then we believe in the of one person not of person we believe in one God who has manifested himself in three offices God is going to rupture a church that we say Amen whether the world believes or not now all these things I'm speaking they are not up for debate your neighbor may be doing touch them tell them oh brother sister these things are not up for tell your neighbor now tell your neighbor brother tell your neighbor sister they not up for def it is real and we have believed it I have believed it is there anyone like me this morning is there anyone like me this morning if you're still doubting it just stay under the word God Will Make It Real to you you may not have become a reflection of the word yet but you believing unto you receive the word of God as an absolute in your soul your faith my faith canot be moved no the testimony against in your flesh your body may say you don't believe but you say my faith canot be the unbelief around you my faith cannot be my faith remains in the word the solid word of God now there's a I want to read for you here if you give me a few more minutes Revelations 2:23 says I'll kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the Reigns and the hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your works now God look and I'm reading a quote here God lookth on the heart that has never changed neither will it ever change amen how many that God looks where Pentecostals love that does not look on top he checks heart the first time you have heard your Prophet telling you the same if someone tells you that tell them I already know it was spoken in in the 1950s by a prophet of God who was vindicating that God looks on the heart that has never changed neither will it ever change but here as through all the ages there are two groups both of the groups are claiming their Revelation from God and their relationship to God nevertheless the foundation of God stand sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are hallelujah hallelujah the Lord knowe them that are the Lord searches the rains that mean that word means to track to follow up God tracks down our thoughts which is our RS he knows what is in our hearts God knows what is in my heart God knows what is in your heart and the seal is he knows them that are his he sees our works which are a definite manifestation of what lies don't deceive yourself your Works choose what is in your heart your Works they depict and make you naked what enters a mind is not what spoil but what gets out is what shows what they don't deceive yourself if you a fornicator you a fornicator if you are lying you are a li if you a thief you a Ste if you put on nakedly don't deceive yourself you have not yet the outward work they depict what you are inwardly somebody was saying some people go oh your hair should only be should only be only this one it only has first of all to be natural is it if there's any Pastor who knows itend it I will repent but what I know it is not not there it is not there whether you add something or don't add something it does not hinder you from going you don't believe that do you I'm talking to the sisters of course but I'm not done so if you're saying Amen on that so now and then they begin to say you only have to have the natural fall back because in the Book of Revelation you saw the ones who were from every age and they had their falling on their it's a beautiful s to behold but that was not a doctrine that their sisters should do that and then when they hear that when they are not changed yet in their you find a sister running Sal they call they call us come and tune me and I want the tune which is on because me I'm of class tell us the hairstyles which are own tell us the hairstyles which are own dreads dread dread not not not not not not looks like like what s Sal do me I want to look like sister I want look like wife don't worry make my hair that's all I want I want my hair to go up to the prolong it do this do that even this one even that and then your hair will be transformed is it a bad thing I don't think it is because it's natural for a woman to want to look beautiful it's not a sin but friend let me tell you something trying to stay in the middle of the line the Bible says we should not look like the world the B says that too now how will you know if you have the spirit of God in you he will tell you that is no problem but it looks like the world if the world does this do this if the world does that do this you must be different you must look different because you a Believer we must not look like them our God should not look like them let me tell you brother sister you don't need me to tell you how to look you need the holy ghost in your soul I've had sisters come to me Pastor I did this kind of hair but the Holy Ghost has been convicting me to remove everything I cannot tell them don't I will tell them follow what the Holy Ghost told I have of mine here came she did all this kind of hair that they do I don't know what happened to her but I heard my wife saying you know why did you remove it you are at school and you need say no I've decid I don't want this again no one told her not she said I want to look natural let me tell you brother sister one thing I would say I believe when the Holy Ghost is in one person he will say the same thing in another another another what I know we are in a generation where everything is artificial everything is fake fake hair fake nails fake eyelashes even fake lips fake ears when someone removes what they have you can even run away listen children of God that are put under my care I'm giving you an instruction by the power of the Holy Ghost look natural that is what I believe that's what I stand for but if you want to look like elsewhere don't you worry don't you worry but when you receive the Holy Ghost he will tell you what to do that's what I believe this message is not rotes of do and do is the power of the Holy Ghost comes in you to guide you and lead you what to do but the scripture tells us a woman should not cut a hair because hair her for her covering if she cuts her ha she should even even pray or even prophesy because she's dishonorable that's what the Bible says but most of these ties that they do they do they don't do them without cutting the hair and they don't and you can't stop it so then you have cutting you have cut your hair whatever you're doing on your hair do not cut your hair but a prophet said if a sister has no hair and maybe she wants to look beautiful or maybe she'll add something that looks like her hair and and you know just to to try and have maybe more hair I have seen women who have no hair at and you know and some of them decide to say well I'll even not put anything it's their conviction if a woman doesn't have hair it's not it's okay to put something a woman looks awkward without hair but then you know you're not going to go and put on all this kind of things that looks like a Chinese looks like this looks like that and some of you even have beautiful hair but you know you just go and put on something else let your glory shine your hair is your glory I'm sorry if I offended one I don't intend to offend I intend to give you the full C of before you before you know it something begins to cro up I want to do like come on do like what the word of God [Music] says praise God we as message Believers we believe this is our our belief system now we believe we are fearfully and wonderfully on our weddings you see sisters coming with natural look beautiful yes I'm going to pick on you sister was beautiful natural no makeup naturally beautiful tell me our girls ugly or do you want me to par them here some of you men who are not seeing you they beautiful and they naturally beautiful sisters don't convert the things of the world that is stinking before the eyes the nost of God [Music] we should be the standard praise God praise God what about a necklace oh a prophet said if your husband gives you one I don't see why it is wrong but we find sisters who are now making it a point to go and buy Bye Bye Bye Bye by they are not even married so who gave you you have a problem praise God and even the Bible says women who profess godliness who you know they godliness where is it in the book of First Peter that it will not be the outward women wearing gold and all this kind of things and everything so what does that mean is it is it wrong to Plate hair is it wrong to you know use jewelry Jew no is it wrong to put on cloes but what is it saying that if a woman is Godly she will not show her character by how nice she has dressed by how much je she has by by by how much you know by how her hair looks but it's going to be a Godly heart out of our heart having a character having the virtues of a woman I remember when I was my wife was still a fiance I want to the show up and Bo I wanted to buy I looked at this beautiful necklace and I her dear I want to give you a necklace well she was coming from another church I know what she said thank you dear you gave me a ring and that is enough I don't want all this kind of I actually wanted to buy it for her I mean it she turned it down but I think she saved me because once they start finishing is very difficult we would have been having budget every week every mon what when you are walking about thank God she saved [Music] me Hallelujah their ornaments will not be the outward oraments but will be of the heart praise God does it mean the outward ones are sinful no but all The Godly women not after the out they will con after the inside and you brother you not see the outside Beauty you the it comes to a place where a Believer will be different from the work you know when you're working not even the message of by way only there are some denominations which have kept that standard and when you walking you can see this one is different are you a Christian yes the way they talk the way they look you know you can tell there is the presence of God I believe the bride of Christ should be EST [Music] manifest Christ praise God he sees our works which are a definite manifestation of what lies within us it is out of the heart that proceeds either righteousness or wickedness our motives our purposes all are known unto him as he watches every action and every action every word shall be brought into judgment when they accounting for our lives there was no fear of God before the fal Vine they for it but when you receive the Holy Ghost because you're the True Vine you will have the fear of God hallelujah hallelujah you're going to give an account don't do things because others do them what does the Holy Spirit speak praise God I've seen young people for instance I give you an example who have no smartphones and others have and they are okay they very spiritual they good in the church but you find brother and you will try to them they get one the moment they get one they will begin missing Church they come in the church the were sitting in front they begin sitting in the what is happening you wanted to be like somebody else you got what you want but is it helping it to come it's a sign that that smartphone you cannot rule over it it's ring over you it's better without it if the B says if one eye causes you to see literally means certain things in this life causes you to be away from God they profane and vain sh sh it there's nothing that should come between me and who name his name leave as becometh Saints we might fool the people but we will never fool the law God knowe them that are his friends as I'm about to conclude I want to tell you this the Lord knoweth them that are his no preacher can save any but let us encourage everybody to come to church let us preach the gospel let us be inclusive but God knows them that I is and except the Lord draws them no one can come to him friend that is why we need a power of the Holy Ghost John 644 says no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me I will raise him up the last John 637 all that the father has given me shall come and that come to me I will know how do you come to him by submitting yourself to the word for I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that and this is the Father's will what is the Father's will that all which he has given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again that is the Father's will he will lose nothing he will not lose me he will not lose you he will not lose you why it is his will he will raise us up at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me everyone which see the son how do you see the son by receiving a revelation of the word and him that believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last praise the Lord the last scripture here in Matthew 13 He says again the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a NE that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind which when it was full they drew to Shore and sat down and gathered the good into the vessels but cast the B away so shall it be at the end of the world the angel shall come forth and thece the wicked from among and S the wicked from among the just already the pre of the go what are they doing they are curing the fishing Hallelujah Hallelujah by the word of God separating the wicked from the that will come is already happening cast them into the furnace of the of fire there shall be waiting and nashing of let me tell you friends the gospel has been cast out into the sea of the world and as it is being pulled out you know those who are just are being separated from the wicked but let me ask you who are the just the Bible says the just shall live by faith faith in what faith in the word the more you believe in the word you are Justified you are Justified not because of your works but because of your faith in the and he says the foundation of God stands he knows them that are is he will lose none of them he will not lose any of them that's why as a pastor people keep coming people keep going some and we keep preaching anyhow because we know that none can go if they are meant to be the father will lose n he will not lose me he will not lose you if your name was in the book praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah amen as the musicians come I want to read this first it says they knew from the Ephesian Church age listen they knew the righteous life that accompanied the bearing of that name for whoo nameth the name of the Lord let him depart from from from from sin be holy ye that bear the vessels of the Lord thou that not thou shall not bear the name of the Lord th God in vain and these Ephesians were Christians these people are Christians 10% Christians oh my only 50% these people here in DF are Christians they were Christians they bore a name and that name was Christ who was the spirit of God within them and which was one of the threefold names of their lord and he says and for my name's sake they have labored and has not [Applause] F may God help us to labor and not F brother ephra may God help you to lab in Ethiopia many things will come and as I was beginning to speak I feel this is a prophetic that will try to DET you that will try to break you away from the CA and the purpose but listen continue laboring as long as you are laboring in his name he says to you brother that I will stand with you I'll go before you I'll will give you strength I'll provide all the resources whatever you need continue laboring hallelujah hallelujah hallelu the Bible says despice not prophesy I did not tell myself to say those words I believe God has not make any mistake I wasn't even supposed to preach today praise God maybe he wanted me to speak so I can give him that prophetic [Music] Believers were are not laboring for Paul or for an organization they weren't committed to programs and institutions whereby they built up Holdings of value we are not laboring for a man we are not laboring for an organization we don't have a religion we are laboring for the Lord they worked for the Lord they were his servants not the Pawns of an organization they didn't go to church on Sunday and talk about the name and then forget the rest of the week they didn't give liap service to that name no sir it was their Liv that we given their lives friends I want to tell you today this it's a confession I've given my life there are many things I could do in life and I'm sure I would Prosper but I decided to give my life to the cause of this message if it is something worth dying for it is worth leing for we ought to give our life not just to talk about it and then we go leave something else God help us it's a choice even as Ministers of the Gospel there are many things we we we would have done but choices we make and they did they did that in that name in that name they acted but if they could not act in that name then they refrain from AC if my preaching is not going to be in the name then I don't need to preach if my life is not going to accompany mym I don't want to pre I want my life and my sermons to be aligned together our life to be aligned with what we confess let the world behold us and see us as different people these were Heavenly placed Christians whose Behavior was in the LA but that first Vine that wanted to defile that name they hung like a scaring wolves in the waiting to get in and tear down but the Saints stood they stood the test and the word and they kept that name may God help us to keep that name friends we cannot take anybody out or in into salvation but we've been [Music] usted with something that has full of life it's our mandate to live the life
