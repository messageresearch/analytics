bless you okay [Music] thank you for praying for me [Music] mothers have lost their children in the world that was there in the in the recent past but God is God the Bible says that he watches over he watches over his own the brother that God told me to go to uh before I went again the brother that God told me to go to um this is a man that was uh almost killed um you know I cannot tell it all but uh he told me you know they shot at him shot at him yes they shot at him went through like but it's went by his side but one of them was called to the Army um and uh another one they had a misunderstanding with the father so he left home um so sometimes actually the Bible says all things work together for good never even the life of a child of God used that to protect that boy not to go so that he would he wouldn't die his name is but guess what on this trip he met God yes he baptized him in the name of it amen amen and then this other one into the army he again that machine but he went there twice they called him twice every time the bus that who took took the other boys brought him back home again miraculously he speaks good English his name is also started to translate this message I tell you I've seen God you know many things were destroyed amen is alive and the fires of the message started in that country um no one can stop it now Rebecca those are your prayers foreign we are going to read verses 16 and up to verses 24 I know many are not here today together they also told me that he would be at the wedding of a sister-in-law brother [Music] ah sister Winnie I know she lost her a mother but I I don't believe she lost her mother because her mother was saved yeah foreign [Music] [Music] then say to he unto him a certain man made a great supper and bed many and sent his servants at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are excuse me are now ready and they and they all with one Accord sent be said um excuse me and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground and I must need to go and see it I pray thee have me excused and another said I have bowed five York of oxen and I go to prove them I pray thee have me excused and another said I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come saw things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and Lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the hold and the Blind and the servant said Lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there is room and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of those men which were Biden shall test of my supper God bless you you may be seated and then our brother will read in Uganda sumaluka is [Music] foreign foreign foreign foreign God bless you amen now I know you've been following in your Bibles so brother Isaac I don't know maybe this is part three or part four I don't know of rescue the perishing but I'm dealing with today the subject I'm speaking on is compare them to come in but I'm still on that topic of rescue the parishes the story how a man can can make a great supper send out invitations they went and called all those who were poor maimed and blind and then they came [Applause] now listen to this the Rapture was not made for everybody the Rapture was only for it's supposed to be for a foreign are you hearing me so the gospel as we know it plain gospel by very many all over the world this morning is very important just say what I'm saying exactly the way I'm saying it you see because I want you to understand this mystery here this morning praise the Lord amen praise the Lord amen praise the Lord amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen decide praise the Lord the girl was not created for people they are too many people go to hell but you know God has sent out a message God has sent out um should I call it a gospel message how many don't understand English okay how many understand English for people but the Rapture was not made for everyone the one that you will believe the gospel we'll go to the Rapture actually there are very many people are going to receive the Gospel and they will attain eternal life but they will never go to and so now we have a message and this message is to the bride now we have of course I shared on that many years ago on the different categories of people in the economy of God and so this morning I want us to see the purpose of the message if you can turn with me to the Book of Revelation chapter 19. and I'm going to look at verse 7 to verses 9. it says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the wedding and to her was granted that she should be a raid in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints and he saith unto them right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto them unto me these are the true sayings of God now since many are invited to take part in eternal life the gospel invitation is a wide invitation to everyone who cares to come you know you know everybody you know you find them on the streets you find them they are they have different Church names they they are called Anglican according to their works but let me ask you a question if Jesus died what why there is the Bible says there is no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus so in other words there are a group of people that really was the purpose why Jesus came on the Earth and those people when they receive Jesus Christ They will receive the father part of him and there will be no need for them to come into the condemnation they will never come before the white Throne judgment there will never be asked for anything they did why because the blood of Jesus Christ atons for every sin they have ever made either turns for everything they have ever met they will be required to do only one thing they will be required only to believe that's why the theme of the of the minister for the bottom was only believe all things are possible the bride they are called The Bride they will be required only to believe but these other people who will receive an invitation to eternal life they will receive it they will accept it but they will go through the white Throne judgment and why because they missed the rapture the Rapture is the marriage of the Lamb hallelujah amen and the Bible says Amen Let us be glad let us rejoice and give honor to him why because the marriage of the Lamb is calm and his bride has made herself ready oh Hallelujah he said his wife has made herself ready are you his wife I am his wife I am his wife and the Bible says his wife has made herself ready listen I did not believe the message because I was fearing to go to hell I believe the message because I discovered I was more than just a believer I discovered that this message was calling me to come up higher the message was calling me to not only be a believer the message he was telling me that I was the wife of Jesus Christ if you see it this morning you'll be blessed now the Bible says here and to her was granted fine linen green and white for the final is like filthy rags before him so now we are talking about here the righteousness of Jesus Christ which is the word which is the word the revealed word of the hour in every age God has been revealing more of himself in every generation now the Rapture is the marriage of the Lamb the Rapture just like we read in the Book of Luke is the great supper and this supper amen he has invited amen those that were meant to come and I believe I am part of those that are going to go on that marriage supper of the Lamb amen and this will be for a space of three years and a half at that time they were there with tribulation on Earth and after the tribulation comes the Millennium so follow me here so now here right now where are we the word of God the inflation is being sent out to as many that shall receive it to to come to the marriage sapana and those who receive it we are waiting for one thing how many knows what we are waiting for the rapture the rapture we are waiting for the Rapture after the Rapture takes place the Earth will continue as it is continuing now but it will go into a Time called the Great Tribulation I don't want to explain it now I don't have time for it but then the Great Tribulation will will continue for a space of love and the Rapture which is the marriage type of the Lamb will also take place for a space of three years and a half so while the bride is in glory the the church the nominal Church those who had accepted Christ but they were not part of the bride and and all the others will live here on Earth and they will go through the tribulation some of those uh what the Bible calls the foolish virgins but there are many categories of people you know some of us would be the foolish virgins and they will stay here on Earth they will go through the tribulation while the bride is in glory with the Lord Jesus Christ and at the same same time amen Christ will now go amen and visit the Jews during that time of the trip they will accept baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen through there receiving their message while Israel is having a Revival the rest of the Gentiles will be in the Great Tribulation but I'm so glad the bride will be in the rapture hallelujah amen we will be together with the Lord we will not be here going through the sufferings amen that the others will be going through we shall be in glory and after three years and a half then comes the uh the the the Millennium now of course we will come down here to the Earth you know and we will be bound a thousand years we will have no time today and the law but you are now what is that time we are not talking about now we're talking about after the Rapture after the three years and a half after the tribulation when it's coming down at that time where is he going he is not going alone by the way he's coming back to this earth together we must says he was riding him in a White Horse and amen behind him was tens and tens of thousands of his Saints we were riding behind him where were we going we were coming down to the Earth to do what to rule together with him for a space of 1000 years that is called the Millennium I am going to be there in the Millennium amen we shall travel like a sword in the Millennium we shall have power to set things and things will happen in the Millennium amen the lion will be led by a little child what are you talking about in the Millennium we have gone back to our original God States like Adam was before the fall in the Millennium we are like God himself and we shall rule with him at that time Jesus Christ will be our husband of course and he will be having occupying the throne the seat Throne of David and so he will be called a son of David because he'll be the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and we will be his wife his bride praise God and then after the Millennium a thousand years there will come the the yeah that is and everything but then the major thing that comes after that is going to be the white Throne judgment now the Bible says and behold I saw a white throne follow me closely here this is some kind of teaching but I'm preaching this morning but I want you to follow me then I saw a white a great big white throne and there was one Saturn on it and now what was he going to do then the Bible says then the Dead this both small and great both rich and poor young and old they all rose up again from the dead let me tell you no one will stay in their graves no one whether they were swallowed that you need to do what to stand Before the Throne where is the bride at that time the bride is together with Jesus Christ at that time no we are not going to be judged the bride is not going to come into condemnation the bride is not going to come into judgment why because our judgment amen we go through it right here on Earth is why we preach as coaching message to condemn you to convict you so that you can repent of your sins amen and be set free so that on that day come on oh my and then after the white Throne judgment then there will come a new Heaven and a new Earth and there are many other things that I've not talked about I'm not going through the order but I want you to see here in the Book of Revelation chapter 20 if you can read with me verses 5. but the rest of the Dead live the north again until the thousand years were finished hmm this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that has part in the First Resurrection on such the second death has no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years so now the Bible here gives us a little more information he says the rest of the Dead live not until a thousand years we are finished now here he is speaking of the Millennium he is speaking of a thousand years halfway living on Earth that we left here on Earth the Bible says the rest of the Dead live do not they did not leave until the Millennium was finished is the rapture the fast Resurrection is the rapture and we are that is our Target that is our goal and he says blessed and the holy is he that has part in the first resurrection now the Bible does not say you are only blessed because you are part of the first resurrection the Bible says you are blessed and You Are Holy how can he that is Holy be judged no because we are blessed and we Are Holy Holy not by our own Works Holy by his own the Bible says blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection oh my I am going to be part of the first resurrection do you believe it are you going to be part of the first resurrection oh my on search on who on those who will have pattern of the first resurrection the second death has no power so now we are we are now getting new ads here first death second death fast Resurrection second Resurrection now the first death is what everybody dies everybody dies and they go to the Grave that is just death death of the body but the second death is the death and destruction of the Soul I'm telling you certain things maybe some of you did not know so you need to listen carefully you know it says that there's nothing like Eternal hair you know Eternal hair is a hell which has no end and the denominations all over the world teach that there is uh going to be an eternal hell without beginning without end but our Prophet told us that everything that has in Hell have a beginning by the way the Bible says hell was created for the devil and his angels so if hell will help because if the people are going to live in hell for eternity it means they have eternal life like us who are going to believe in eternal life you see so they will also have eternal life in another big confused be confused to say we are going to have eternal life in heaven and they are going to have eternal life in hell and that means they're also having eternal life is only the place which is the difference but the truth is hell is not going to be a tunnel hell is going to be a season and Seasons that brother says it might be a million years it might be a very long time I don't know but it will eventually come to an end and then in the new Heaven and the new Earth there won't be held praise God and the devil will be thrown into the Lake of Fire and and all the others who did not believe but you see that is the second death all the souls of those who refuse to believe the message who refuse to you know to accept Christ who refuse him and the invitation they were thrown into the second death the Bible says but he that comes in the first resurrection on such the second death has no power now I've heard many people who say even if I am not the bride and I don't come through the first resurrection I will come through the second Resurrection which is going to stand before the white throne and I will be the foolish virgin and I will eventually get eternal life let me tell me before the white throne we have no guarantee you have no guarantee that you will have eternal life there no guarantee absolutely why because it is a hundred percent based on him and his decision according to your works so now the Bible says the ones who come in the first resurrection the second death has no power meaning the ones who are coming through the second Resurrection the second I mean actually they are all supposed to be condemned even you Among Us the one who feels is holier than everybody else right now in your state when you come before that weight Throne judgment you will be condemned as a sinner you will be condemned and by the bottom to spoke about that many times you will be condemned there is no way you can go through that judgment no human being can be able to go through that judgment and therefore those who are going to go through it it will not be based on their righteousness or what they have done that is good it will be best on him according to their works the Bible says the righteous unfair judge so he will judge them and he Sam he will give life and others he will condem and they will go into the second death I don't want to to play Lottery with my life I want to go to a deal and my sure deal here is being in the first resurrection if I'm in the first resurrection I am sure of this one thing brother Marvin that the second death has no power on me I am dead Once In Christ and my life the life that I live is not my life it is the life of Jesus Christ and I am sure the second death has no power on me and the Bible says they are priests of God and of Christ and they shall reign with him a thousand years and those are the ones going in the Rapture now in First Peter chapter two I'm just giving away the foundation here to be able to go in Luke 14. First Peter chapter 2 verse 9 he says but he him who has called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in time passed away another people but are now the people of God which had not ordained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy the Bible says those people and I believe I am greater generation he had a special group of people that he called peculiar he called important and thus he is so jealous over them and those he wants them to go in the Rapture and those he doesn't want them to come into condemnation and because of that special message and this message is different from the gospel that they preach the gospel that they preach is only meant to bring them into life or you can call it salvation but I'm not we are here for something more than salvation if you understand it many people are going to be saved brother Fred but not all that are saved will be the bride if you understand it say Amen I realize what I'm preaching today some people may be confused a bit if you're confused come to me after service so I can listen to the service again and again and read the scriptures yourself you'll get it but listen to me this message is not only for the Salvation of our souls many people are going to be saved but not all will go in the rapture did you think that the foolish virgins are going to be lost yes yes how can they be lost when they are virgins how can a virgin virgin means they are righteous the the the the the Christ right but they were foolish they didn't have what it took to be the bride and the bride is also predestinated before the foundation of the world so for you to be the bride there is nothing you do to be the bride that is only one thing for you to be who you are to believe the word of the bridegroom when you believe the word of the bridegroom that is that is the absolute you know the wise virgins had that oil the extra oil and and he says they say the proof that you have the Holy Ghost is not speaking in tongues it's not jumping up and down it's not shouting it's not excitement although that is a part of it but the proof that you have filled with the Holy Ghost is by receiving the word of your day you know why because if you receive the word of your day you cannot receive the word of your day unless you are the bride and if you receive the word of your day you will live the life now this class of of those in the first resurrection is a special class these do not go into eternal life on their own merits these enter in solidly on the basis of his Mercy through his blood oh hallelujah thank you Jesus they are more than just salvation they are more than just eternal life they go to the marriage supper the others don't go there but this way our royalty is that a man so if you want to it's not just oh my God it's not just intended to bring us into the king's presence or his purpose is not just to make us have a little encounter with the King there are many women that have an encounter with the King but it stopped there they never ever came so our purpose is not passes to stay in his presence Esther was the Queen Esther became the queen our purpose is to become the queen all these girls who came before the king and the King just them away what happens so there are many going to remain in the palace many are going to go to heaven men are going to do what to go to heaven but they will not be the bride they will not be the wife of the king many remained in the palace go read the book of Esther many remain in the palace whatever they needed the king gave them gifts the king gave them and they gave them special houses but you see there is this special one for her she was not just thrown of the Kingdom now I want you to look at Revelation 3 21. to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I sat down in my father's Throne he has an ear let him let him Church hear what the spirit says unto the churches so to him that over what is in every Church age let me let me give you a little more background here we have seven Church ages seven Church edges now of course um sometimes when I'm preaching I just go over it but let me take a moment to explain or expound this for you a little bit when you look at the book of Roman later if you look at Romans chapter 11 he explains the difference between the Church of the Jews and the Church of the Gentiles now the Jews were the original brand bride now the Bible says the the the Jews will be restored but the Jews will not be restored I I spoke a little bit about the 70 weeks of Daniel you know God showed Daniel how long God would work with the Jews until the Millennium by the way until the Millennium you know he showed them 70 weeks 70 weeks of years meaning each week was how many years yes seven years and so so now in the last week of the of the 70 weeks the Messiah was cut off follow me closely here now put on your spiritual thinking cap in those last seven years last week three years and a half do you understand that brother Enoch three years and a half the Jews are remaining with three years and a half counting when they did stop counting it stopped counting when the Messiah Jesus Christ was killed on the cross are you following me Church when the when the when the Messiah was killed when he was cut off the the time of the Jews stopped counting it was paused so God stopped working with them until now I've met several Jews but Jews don't believe in the Messiah Jews many of them don't even believe in God they are blinded in Romans 11 he says they are blinded for what for what sake for your sake the Gentiles you see how long are they going to be blinded how long are they going to be blinded they are going to be blinded for until the times of the Gentiles come to their fullness so let us say that this was the time when they were blinded when Jesus Christ was you know killed and then when it rose again from the moment he rose again the disciples started preaching and where were they preaching to to the Gentiles Paul became the Apostle to the Gentiles and when he laid that Foundation to the Gentiles time of the Gentiles started counting we started the teaching on the seven Church ages if you if you don't have a message as a church edge book please find one brother Marvin you know raise up your hand this is brother Marvin if you want to church each book contacted he'll get you one started that church edge book it will show you you know the time of the Gentile space of seven Church agents are you following me quickly go to Revelation I didn't plan this but let me just show you to you for just a few moments uh Revelation chapter 1 are you there if you're there Say Amen are you there all right so saying I am verse 11 I am the Alpha and Omega the first one which are in Asia and Anthony Philadelphia and and to Lord this year now these churches were in Asia being the gospel the invitation has been said that's what we are receiving today and so you notice that it started here with Apostle Paul and he started counting how many generations one two three four five six seven when it religious seven you know seven is completion when it religious seven the times of the Gentiles will be fully Hallelujah finished it would have been completed do you know where we are are we on two are we on three are we on six where are we seven we have reached the end of the gentle dispensation and right here right here the Bible now gives a promise Hallelujah in every Church age he was giving a promise to the Overcomers and let me tell you who were the Overcomers in every age the Overcomers in every age we are those who receive the word of their messenger and now when he reaches to the end the last Church age he has this to say to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne hey Hallelujah the promise to the last Gentile bride is the throne tell your neighbor the throne the throne my brother the throne that is our promise our promise is not just not to go to heaven he didn't say oh to the Overcomers I'll let them have it on life no more than eternal life more than eternal life eternal life is a must amen why because we have accepted Christ but here he's giving us more than salvation he's giving us a throne my goodness the bride of Christ will hear if every word and submit every word she will overcome unbelief she will believe every word amen God has sent seven minutes what are we doing finding the last one because their message is mandated to find the bride in every age this message is supposed to find the bride in every age how by those who have eaten it they will have a burden for the souls out there not just for them to know Christ and that's it but for them to become a father part of Christ to become a part of him to become Amen to become his wife their purpose is to go find the bride in every Age The Bride in every age will hear not only here but believe and not only believe but at work in a message of their day that message you will prepare them for the rapture and this message is preparing us for the rapture that is what makes us different I say that is what makes us different from the other denominations why because we have a message they don't have a message am I preaching to someone they don't have a prophet we have a prophet we have a messenger and we have a message and this message is preparing us for the rapture Hallelujah Hallelujah oh I'm thinking of the Rapture in our blessed home on High when the redeem the Gathering in oh Hallelujah be among the saints I'll be in that number one of them one of them I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them there are people almost everywhere baptized in his name why are we saying we are one of them because we have received a revelation amen we have a revelation bubbling in our souls we are one of those going in a rapture Hallelujah hey man and we are not going to go on the Rapture based on how good we are yes we are going to be good but not by our in ourselves we are going to be good according to his word we are going to receive every word amen the Bride is a sheep of his flock amen whenever the word is preached the ship says bad Hallelujah whenever the word is preached the script says Ah man amen I believe the word I mean why you will not you know some people who are not the body if you go and preach the things we preach here in other churches people will be selecting that one amen that one that is too much women should not wear trousers it is too judgmental I don't want to be judged don't worry there is another judgment for you but those ones who accept it say Amen I'm judged oh God help me let me change it yeah your judgment is here amen you know you know let fornication not be named among you some people are there [Music] but the bride will say amen amen amen why because their judgment is you know the message will make you you know by saying Amen to the word by receiving the word amen the spirit of God will come amen amen by your amen and make you live that word the life of the world will just come down through your heart amen it will first amen your body it will force amen you are understanding to submit Hallelujah to submit it to the word even when you have no power of your own something inside of you will force you to submit to that word hallelujah that is what makes us different from the denominations because the denominations are preaching us also gospel they are preaching a gospel which they say oh we believe we are saved by the grace of God you know we are going to heaven yeah they are going to heaven I may not doubt that that much although I don't know I have no Surety but what I know they may go but all I know all I know I am the bride I am the bride why because I've received the heaven whack every word vashti let me tell you about vashti vashti was the queen the denominations they had that ability of being the Queen the potential because they had accepted the word and the word is the seed so vashti was the queen but what the modern version what removed her from her place you never touch age you would say or else I will come at you if you don't believe or else I'll come quickly and I'll remove the Candlestick he said what made virtually be removed from her place unbelief the king said bring her call her to come and she said no she said no instead of saying amen but the bride says Ah man ah man whatever the word of God says you say Amen you don't reason with it you don't debate with the word you only say ah man I believe it so be it according to your word I don't have the power to do it but amen it is your word so so be it I receive it I accept it let it live in me that is what makes the difference we believe every word cover to cover cover to cover to cover we believe it all we don't choose what we want we accept everything in here to be thus saith the Lord Hallelujah people have taken the words of brother but I'm a prophet of this message of this generation and they pick some words by the way all preachers do it all preachers and a few bold ones have come out and spoken openly they didn't say you know we read the message of brother Bannerman most of the things we do we are trying to copy him and the things we're trying to teach we're trying to copy from his message no they don't say like that but they say you know one of them was saying you know William Branham a mighty man of God a pillow came so you know all that information how did you get it you are studying his message you are stealing from his message and you are preaching to your people a little here a little there and you you don't have the guts or the strength to tell them everything but they are Hallelujah there are people who are already receiving everything amen who are going to be identified with the messenger of their generation we are going to eat all the book everything in the book Hallelujah and we are not ashamed to identify ourselves with the message if you are ashamed you can suit yourself as far as I'm concerned I am not ashamed even where I go in Ethiopia I have been telling people look William Marion Branham is the messenger of Our Generation and I met this preacher 32 years preaching 32 years at my age he's been preaching the whole time I've lived old man and his ear he asked me a question he said how everything you're saying is right but how do I know that William Branham is the one who is this messenger yeah I clearly see there is a messenger an Elijah supposed to come in the last days but how do I notice William brother I also asked him how do you know that the Messiah was the Messiah do you know that Messiah was rejected by people who knew the prophecy but who did not believe it was Jesus so knowing the word does not mean you believe the word you know but you say text Revelation for you to believe the word and that reversion comes from God you know how did they know I told him they knew that he was the Messiah by their by his Works he said if you don't believe my words at least see the things I'm doing and see that this is why that which is written of me same thing to John the Baptist they didn't believe him but when they asked him who are you he said I am the voice crying from the Wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord so he was trying to say see am I not doing what was written about me so how do you know that William Branham is the messenger of the last generation called Lord this year is because his ministry did what the Bible said he would do the Bible says in the Book of Matthew that Elijah when he comes he shall restore all things and all the teachings of the word have been restored back to the church baptism in Jesus in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ you know one God that has been restored you know about the ministry you know women not being pastors or preachers or Bishops or things like that according to the Scriptures it has been restored the operation of the gifts in their right way has been restored and many other things according to Revelation 10 7 he says he will finish the mystery of God and the Mystery on the seven series on the church ages on the all these things have been revealed why that proves his ministry as the Elijah of Our Generation no man can be able to say it is not and no other Ministry can be able to raise up and say oh no I'm the one why because they are Ministry proves otherwise praise God and we thank God to receive this message this messenger is preparing us for the for the coming of the Lord in the message the comfort of brother says God help me God help you as Christians never to compromise one word of God's word for this sacred trust has handed was handed to the church and it's a glorious thing to have this gospel the Full Gospel to preach it without compromising anywhere preach it just as it is written leave it just as it is written what a sacred Trust and if we ever expect this word to ever come to pass if we ever expect God to keep his word we've got to stay with it just the way God wrote it that's the reason if you stay with with it the way God wrote it there will be all kinds of things happening among you every word will be fulfilled hmm if we stay with the word the word has been written things will be happening miracles signs and wonders powerful things will be happening in our midst why because God will fulfill everyone that is written Among Us and he says I am my other expectations just now myself of seeing a shaking power come that will shake the Nations pretty soon God can can never ever get a people under his own God can can ever get a people under his own control if it's if you get a man or a woman that won't compromise on his word but he will but he will stand there like the Rock of Ages are you that man or that woman that will stand there not compromising on any word that will believe every word of it and believe that he is behind it who is behind it God and a man who believes it you must act like it tell your neighbor you must act like it you must act like it if you don't act like it then you don't believe it hey act like it and you can put it to work and the word will be in you so to those of you who are not married and you are seeking for wives Brothers and you are seeking for a wife but the question is do you believe everyone if you doubt the word if you debate with the word it will not happen God is under no obligation to fulfill his word in your life but if you take your ground and you like the Rock of Ages and say I believe the word I am not going to go with those prostitutes or with those you know you know you know girls out there in the world I'm not going to go with with those chorus girls I'm going to marry a holy ghost-filled Child of God if you make that stand and you make it as your stand you stand there as a Rock of Ages you believe that with all your heart then God is obligated to make that word come true in your life praise God Pastor Marcus has quite a few young men maybe I don't know maybe like seven or ten who are not married yet and I was telling him that these young men need to get married he said oh yes but we don't have sisters in the church here now I reminded him I said oh are you telling me that are you telling me that and I reminded him of his testimony you know they were the first Believers in the country and you know we're having no Believers absolutely nobody nobody was a Believer you know you have about three four you have let's say I don't remember how many in the world said maybe four younger men and four young ladies about two young ladies and four younger men and these younger men don't want to marry these young ladies they they feel they are not theirs and then they all want to get married so what do they do and they know according to the message they're not going to marry the unbelievers so they had to take their stand I went in my office at that time in Ethiopia and I thought I said God this is your word I believe it it's a prophet of this generation he says under no circumstance should believe as mother and unbelievers so what am I going to do because it appears there is an exception here I was speaking to the Lord in my heart about these things it appears there is an exception here these people they are of all believe the message but in the whole country of more than 100 million people they are not Believers like them so Lord I believe this is an exception and then I had a voice speak to me under no circumstance should believe my mother and I believe I said why is it echoing back to my mind this should be the Lord telling me my word is my word and is already settled in heaven so when I went out of that office I was because I had not preached that in the church yet I I needed to know what to preach to the people and to teach them what you are teaching them is what they will become so if I was going to tell them well there's an exception you know you can that's what would have become but you know I laid it down the way it is it is God's word I believe is the message of Our Generation he said it even the Bible says you know you know you should not York together with the non-believers so I laid it down for them and I told them God is obligated to stand behind his word each time his word is believed God is obligated to stand behind that word so I told them God is obligated to stand behind that word and uh and and then one by one began to receive Revelation they believed it by the way they accepted it all those people all those people the youngest was Ephraim brother Ephraim who was about 18 at that time or 17 and now he's 23 21 but he's married he was the youngest among them so I'm telling you that God will fulfill his word among the eldest and the youngest as long as you stand with this word Like a Rock of Ages you stand on it you stand on it you don't compromise with it I bet God will stand behind that word to prove to you this is my word and I am God I fail not I fell not Hallelujah and even in our church here by that there are some younger men several of them maybe three maybe four I don't know who are been standing on the word and they are soon going to get married so we are going to have weddings here very soon Hallelujah yes I'm telling you we are going to have weddings if not this year this coming year we are going to have like four weddings that is a spoken word believe it Hallelujah yes if you stand with the word God is obligated to fulfill it don't compromise don't compromise don't go for something else take the counsel of God praise God now when he told them and I'll be uh maybe I'll continue with my message on Sunday but let me on Wednesday but let me go a little more here in the Book of Luke 14 8 where we read he says and they all with one our consent began to make excuse the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground I have I I want to go say it I and then another one you know they all began to give excuses I have an oxy and I have to go prove it I have you know a murder wife I want to you know and then if I cannot come deliberately began to turn away the Holy Ghost now let me tell you this message which we have received is the Holy Ghost we sing it and say it is the Holy Ghost and power it is keeping me alive this message is the Holy Ghost and power is keeping us alive not in itself but the power and the Holy Ghost comes with it and then he says here in the message is your life worthy of the Gospel by the way this message is your life worthy of the Gospel I recommend it to all you Brethren to go and listen to it I wish you would go and listen to it is your life worthy of the Gospel 6306 30. please go and listen to it he says when God sends the Holy Ghost and knocks at a man's door and he deliberately turns it down sometime he's going to turn it for his last time and then you won't be a privileged character you can sit in church and listen to the gospel and agree with the gospel you might do so much and say I know it is right but never put a thing on it to help it yourself you just you just listen to it because you say I believe it's all right that you are just sympathizing with it we have many people like that they come you know they turn down the word they turn down the Holy Ghost but they just say yeah it is right it is right it is right I could say I believe that's a ten thousand uh dollars but that doesn't mean I have it I could say that's a good cold water but refuse to drink it you know what I mean and this eternal life to refuse to do it one day you will cross the line between judgment and mercy and then you won't be uh you want to have the privilege to come and receive it and these people here they turned it down each and every one of them they turned it down he gave them an invitation they turned it down they are having excuses you know let me tell you how many times have you had excuses not to believe or to do what God said because you felt something you had a reason you know church is excuses you have an invitation he has invited you he has a tablespread by that let me tell you whenever the word of God is preached God wants souls to hear it God wants and let me tell you a church that loses the burden for lost souls is a dead Church are you hearing me Church if you and the church is you as an individual it is me if you lose if you feel in your heart you have no burden to tell somebody about what you have received it means you yourself you are not convinced about it but if you are convinced about this message you will not be coming to church on Sunday every day alone by yourself why you're going to have a partner remember when I was still in school I would want I had this hunger I had this thirst of inviting someone you know I wanted every time I'm with my friends I'm very busy showing them you know and they are saying no I'm very busy you know showing them motion because I had this button I had this hunger I wanted them to know what I knew I wanted them to know my God I wanted them to go to the Rapture imagine the mere thought of thinking I'm going to go to the Rapture and leave my friends who was killing me so oh God I want to also compare them I want to bring them in I want us to go together one time I remember I went to church and I was at school I was a a school and then I went to church that evening it was there was a service so I came rushing because I was a bit late and then I found the church locked hi no one hi I almost fainted I was like oh God they have left me and they say hey Google because the church was locked and then I started fidgeting I had my Nokia I started 210 I thought I don't remember some of you don't know that phone and then I started calling calling the pastor's phone the telephone number you've got not available [Music] said let me call another brother's number this one must be on because I was calling the spiritual Brothers only you know in that moment you're not called a brother or the sister you know that it was always you know lazy you will call the one who you know Insidious so that you know if this one is here everything is fine so I started getting another number of a brother and when I called he said a telephone number you've called it's not available I said I'm finished hey little I'm telling you the truth my my feet began shaking I said oh God the Rapture has has happened and then I said but let me try one more I call the pastor's wife so let me record it I was sweating my feet was shaking and then I called the number I said wrote you now I said let me listen it was not ringing so I think they have left they have gone so hello ah I said oh thank you Jesus said yes yes said oh we are in a convention I said ah I even Switched Off I said Thank You Jesus hey I began worshiping there because I knew I was not left for the rapture let me tell you let me tell you some of you are playing with this message you are going to be so sad when you come one day and you meet yourself here in the church alone and you realize there is no picture there is no song reader there is no pianist why because they have all gone to the Rapture and you are alone here you are going to be so sorry that you will realize will be the greatest mistake you've ever met when it all Dawns on you it was real it wasn't a joke hey hey white will be so bad for you it will be some one who was going to the Catholic Church because for you you know everything that is coming next hey the people who were hearing what you people are preaching huh some of those that you told to stream yourselves and they had a little bit about the Rapture they will they will call you and they will find your number on so they will consult with you tell us what is coming next you are the people who was preaching these things and you will tell them don't talk to me not because you know what is coming next you know what the tribulation is coming next you will know everything you will know you are doing because you are not even too sure that you will have his Mercy because Grace can no longer work for you Grace will be over by the way Grace is over at that time no more grace the Bible says here that is filth is filth is still he that is Holy is a holistic you see but when you a man hears the word and spans God is Mercy by refusing to believe the word by refusing to let the word be a father part of him just like wash to refuse oh brother sister it will be so sad for them at that day but I don't want to be among of them I want to be a man of those that receive everyone whereby I can live every night every day and be waiting for the coming of the Lord not only in this one thing amen that I'm one of his and he's mine that Jesus is mine Jesus Is Mine everywhere everywhere I be Jesus Is Mine hmm and uh you know if you have that button and you believe this message with all your heart you're going to have a burden for the lost souls to compel them because you want them to come you want them there is this friend of mine I had I was always preaching you know one time I took the message books I started reading for him by force I told him listen because I was I read the message like this one which I read is your life of the gospel and I was telling you to read it so with you I just told you to read but with him I would pull him put him in my uh next to me in the when everybody has gone to the dormitory to sleep and we sit in the classroom and I take the message out I begin reading I will tell him let me just unread one page for you so I'll begin reading one page after after the first page it becomes appetizing for him he tells me read the next page and I read the next page he says read the next page we would finish the whole book of 30 pages why because it was so appetizing for him it was so real it was so powerful and at the end he came to church he came to church and he wanted to hear more and you know when the devil saw that he wanted to hear more then at his church they told him now you're the youth leader from beginning with today yet he was the most despised among others people you know they gave him to be the youth leader and they stopped coming to church here until today I always called him I said do you remember the message used to give he said yes it is the truth but pray for me but let me tell you I feel sorry for him but I compelled him each time let me tell you whoever you are in contact with compel them to come in the door is fast closing the door is fast closing the time of Grace is finishing and if you if they've had and they've had in their hearts there's no more grace for them Grace is Grace as long as it can be received are you hearing me Church so he says Jesus said you go bring them bring them go tell this the poor the maim the whole the blind you know let me tell you not very many people who are powerful in the status of this world believe this message many of them you know the Bible says in First Corinthians 1 26 for you see your calling Brethren how about many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God has chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise and God has chosen the weak things of this world to confound the things that are Mighty and the best things of this world are the things that are despised God has chosen yeah and the things which are not to bring to note the things which are that no flesh shall glory in his presence God doesn't want you to go in the Rapture and say it was because I was very rich it was because I gave a lot of money to church you know this is why they're doing their churches they make they get the rich people and a brother my brother are you in the service can you give me that chair which I Seated on come with it please they get the rich people like this brother and they tell them you you are rich sit next to the preacher sit here because he's giving a lot of tithe he's giving a lot of money to the church he's giving you know every time the pastor is preaching he's looking at the rich man to see whether he's smiling or not if the man is not smiling he will change his gospel a bit and then he will look again then if the man is going to say yeah now now the word is working because he's expecting another check or he's expecting another money he's expecting something from this man and this is what the gospel has become but the Bible says in look at our calling just look for example in this little Fellowship here not many mighty not many powerful they are there but they say they are not so many there are not so many of the world not so many rich not so many but he has chosen the foolish things oh are you the wise things my brother he says he has chosen the foolish things huh I will not call you my foolish brother but I'll call you my my precious brother he has he has God as the foolish things of the world to the world we are foolish but to God we are wise God bless you my brother here we don't make the rich people sit on the pulpit you see this is what they have made this is what they have made the church you see they have made it a place of Comedy a place where you know the the the they recognize you know one another and you know but you see it says go to the streets go to the bias call everyone call the blind call the name call everybody let them come in Hallelujah that is our mandate and I said this should be the burden of this church it should be the vision of his church our vision is not to get many numbers of people or to get a beautiful building our vision in days of the voice Fellowship is to get every soul that was predestinated unto life that is our vision that's why we preach if that wasn't the reason I would not be preaching I tell you but God proved it to me that you can call people he can sanctify people when I was Ethiopia I almost cried you know brother Gideon but again picked my my wife and I from the airport many years ago about 11 years ago just you know we were very little and you know just going on our honeymoon and he picked us up from the airport he took us to his house gave us a room and then introduced to us the the little uh uh the little guest house where we started staying and that's where the church started from but in that guest house we started inviting people one by one what was our burden what was our vision to tell them about this message to tell them there is a bride that God is calling out of their denominations to tell them there is a message to the world so now brother Gideon 11 years later was in the church with me on Sunday last Sunday you know and he sat there and after the service he told me you must be very happy I said yes brother Gideon it is beyond words to see all those people that have believed the message now in the country more than you know we are counting down the rivers of more than 500 and plus you know in the country of Ethiopia just because of a witness and a burden and I'm telling you friends God can use you to change this country you as an individual as long as your burden is right some of you will brother Gideon at that time gave us three hundred dollars it is never mentioned anywhere but his reward is in heaven some of you may give money others God may use you to you know there's a sister when I was going she gave me a hundred thousand God bless you whoever you are you know she gave me 100 for the mission and others you know you may pray just to sincerely you pray others you will go out and bring a friend others you will do something but let me tell you the burden is to bring and compel them to come in for the married sub of the Lamb that is our burden if God brings them and they happen to be ten thousand well and good but if all that there is in namgongo is 100 that's what we want I'm telling you that's our vision our vision is not to become you know these days the preachers their vision is oh I want to be a very rich preacher I want to all own a private jet you know they they set those goals right at the beginning they write it down even some of them write it down I met them I've met them and they call themselves Visionaries they say I'm a Visionary what is your vision number one in 10 years I want to have a 10 000 people then then after this time then I want to buy a private jet I want to buy a this is expensive suits a specialist shoes and you know these kind of cars and you know and own this number of houses and I have a cathedral that is that those are not our vision that's not our vision if they're doing it it's not our vision our vision is very different from the denominations your goal is the rapture and our vision is to call the last one so we can go are you here in good church and that's why Jesus Christ said he was so sad when he saw that nobody came he was so sad he said I no one came no one okay if they have refused go to the main go to the poor tell them to come they came and the servants came and said yeah they have come and yeah there is room [Music] can you sing with me now Rue yes there is Rule there is a roommate fountain for thee one more time room oh yes there is a roof there is a room at a fountain there is room room [Music] yes there is a roof ah the fountain and they said there is room so he said if there is room if there is room hey let me tell you how men are we here we don't know however much we are I want to tell you there is room even here in the church our church is here look at yourself look at every chair that doesn't have a person sitting next to you look around check the labor that look around there is room can we say there is room here there is room the place is not full there is more souls out there that can that need to fill those chairs we all talk about the body should not be in the pastor's bubble you understand it should be the burden of every believer who is convinced and concerned about this message to be the truth it should be a button brother Joe it should be about in my brother my sister you know whereby you will invite somebody to church whereby you will you know convince them compel them that's the word there is room at a fountain for them you don't bring them to a church you bring them to Christ that's the difference between us and the denominations I want to conclude now looking at verse number three he says if there is room now go to the streets and highways and hedges compare them to come in that my house may be filled I was supposed to say I was supposed to stay in Addis uh for three days and then spend the rest seven or ten days uh up in the in the Northern areas those northern areas if you've not read articulated article it's a bit dangerous because it's uh they are considered to be one of the uh founders of Christianity actually because they they've been Christians for very many years they actually did their history back to Solomon and the Queen of Sheba which is the queen Market of Ethiopia some sometime back in in many years ago and so they even claimed to have the Ark of the Covenant in that region somewhere in one of the churches and it is heavily regarded no one even knows where it is and so they kind of Disguise it and things which could be true or not true I don't know but when you read in the Bible actually after the Queen of Sheba visited Solomon you don't see any mention of the Ark of the covenants it could be true that the queen took it to custody but we do not know but that that place is considered to be one of the places that uh they have they believe themselves you know Aramaic the old writings of the Bible were in Aramaic in a special day some of them and around Mike comes from geese and giz uh is the language of these people in a in a tigray and Amharic and tigrinya comes both an Aramaic from geese and so they say even the Bible was written in their language and and they said so we have nothing to give them nothing new to give them but I desire to if it wasn't because I was compelled to stay in Addison I wanted to go and you know go all over those areas and saw the seat of the world that's what I always do travel around and then now concentrate on small small areas but even then God was able to give us Souls who are burdened for this word and they wanted to spread in the in their area one of these pastors that I told you of he spoke to me said what are we going to do because this is the truth if we started preaching it now everybody will say we are preaching heresy and I told them if it's the truth God will stand behind truth God will vindicate you the nomination is standing behind them but God will stand behind you and if God is behind you then you are sure you God will protect you and God will strengthen you and I told him this is what we have done and I gave them the testimony of Addis Ababa gave them the testimony of Uganda how many Believers have believed this message let me tell you never be ashamed to stand for this message never because God is behind this message you young people God is behind this message your generation may not agree with you when you you you you even feel ashamed to say it because your field is so far from what they believe no if you say the word God is behind you at that moment God is behind you at that moment and God will fight for those that stand for his word and he said to that if there is still room go to the highways and the ages compare them to come where are the people who are abandoned for the lost souls where are they where are they even now in the fellowship here where are they are you burdened for the Lost Souls but people listen to what the prophet says here in God's provided way I'll I'll just read this last one I'll skip that in the eligation church AJ says they were not burdened for Souls talking of the denominations but they were abandoned with wealth they had the wrong burden they had a burden for their wealth but not abandoned for lost souls the scriptures say they didn't know that they were wretched or miserable blind let me tell you money doesn't bring Souls nor does money make a rich did you know that the Bible says by the way this is the richest age that there has ever been on Earth Our Generation is the richest some of you have a smartphone uh even Solomon never had one King Solomon I'm talking about and you have one you are richer than King Solomon in that regard this is the richest age your plans Rockets science medicine you know a lot of things are accumulated and and you know people have broken you know into you know God is laboratory and they've been able to invent many things even in science why because wisdom has increased and money has increased so they have a lot of wealth but the more wealth the we have attained the Lesser burden we have had for lost souls you see every Church these days and I'm concluding here every church is burdened to see which is the best better Church I'm even afraid in the message it is also coming whereby pastors are competing who is the who who has a better Ministry a better Church who has more people who who has more people who who has this better who who preaches better than the other one who this is not supposed to be our burden who has more money this other abandoned friends let us wake up what is our burden our burden is for lost souls our burden is to compel them that was the burden of when he was pulled to places you know you will get this better he said no when he came to South Africa they were telling him not to preach the Negroes the black people but he said no I must preach to them because it was his burden our battle is not for money for church for riches for buildings for more people for more money for more cars more this more that if God gives it to us praise God but our body is for souls for them to come to the knowledge of the truth for them to realize who they are what are you going to do about it Jesus Christ has said go out to the streets and there by ways compare them to come compare them to come compel them compel them is like almost begging them please come please come not to the church or to the church or the or system compel them to come to the message of the hour be consumed with a desire for them to realize what God has done for you this message we have received is not a denomination it's not another church it's more than a church oh my God it's more than a church huh no someone told me all that many churches they said so what this is not just a church another church there are many churches yes but this is not a church it's more than a church it's a lighthouse that is standing for the message of the hour Hallelujah and it doesn't have to take me it can take anybody but this Pulpit is dedicated to preach this message and whoever will stand here at the purpose the desire is to preach to let the light shine so that those who are in darkness can be able to be compelled to come and realize what Jesus Christ is doing in our day let us stand up on our feet [Applause] thank you foreign I surrender all to you everything I give to you [Music] I don't know how to express myself I've just maybe shared a quarter of what I had in my heart to you today because the burden is great there's a lot to do there's a lot of work to do you know even sometimes as preachers we say oh Lord I want to do this I don't have money but you realize it's not money that does it it is the burden that God stands behind that but even if we ourselves what have we done what have you done personally have you compared them to come what have you done in your own little way those are the rewards which will be revealed when we go over Over Yonder the sacrifices you have made for this precious message [Music] if God can consume us with a desire for lost souls and if you are here and you are lost soul maybe you're lost and you've lost your way I'm compelling you in the name of Jesus Christ to repent of your sins and repent of your ways and come to the Lord because times running out so fast on us we don't know what is going to happen next [Music] God help us Lord Jesus father I pray over these people Lord and Whoever has been under the sound of my voice in this service Lord I've laid out a little bit of the burden you've blessed on my heart there's a lot of work we have to do how long shall we continue the childish things Lord of thinking it is money that can do it or it is a power or strength or ability Lord we realize it only takes a little body and a little nudge obedience to just go out and compare them to come this is more than just a church or more than just salvation it is calling your bride in this last age and help us to surrender ourselves Lord that each and every one of us will be more burdened for your walk Lord mobile and for your work Lord just pray in your heart say Lord give me more burden for your souls what are you doing around your neighborhood I have even desired the Lord willing if we tarries to just begin you know visiting homes of Believers on a few days maybe a day or two in a week and you know if you're burdened for that you just invite some people in your house and we just evangelize to them and tell them about this message maybe someone can begin with that maybe you can begin with that and invite us we will come for sure I want it to be a bad and I don't want to just call you and say sister so and so brother so and so we are coming to your house I wanted to be an initiative that you do you make on your own and begin to invite people to your house and invite us to come and share the word with them if you are not a call to preach there's a lot more that we have to do friends in the world to you everything I give to you with only nothing we don't think nothing with all nothing I Surrender I sorry oh to you everything sing it everything I gave to you without nothing without nothing foreign [Music] [Music]
