[53:39] Our Father we are the clay and and the
[53:44] work of thy
[53:47] hands we can also go to Luke chapter 15
[53:50] verse 10
[53:57] it
[53:58] says likewise I say unto you there is
[54:02] joy in the presence of the angels of God
[54:06] over one sinner that repenteth
[54:10] Hallelujah you can have your
[54:19] seats I really want to thank the Lord
[54:22] that has enabled me once again to stand
[54:24] here it is not easy because here we do
[54:27] not speak the words of a man when you
[54:29] try to speak your words you become you
[54:33] you become a
[54:35] failure
[54:36] Hallelujah but just pray for me to
[54:39] deliver the message God has given me our
[54:43] message today will be broken pieces
[54:46] being made
[54:52] whole truly from the beginning we see
[54:57] Adam when God had created
[55:00] Adam he created a righteous
[55:04] man but the devil creped
[55:08] in and lied into Eve and Eve lied the
[55:12] husband and told the husband and the
[55:15] husband had nowhere to escape it because
[55:18] he was the Redeemer of
[55:23] Eva so from that from from the beginning
[55:27] the vessel that go the the person God
[55:30] that created was broken by the
[55:35] devil you may ask yourself what was good
[55:39] when that was
[55:44] happening it may be a question to
[55:49] everyone but God had given
[55:52] man
[55:53] uh that
[55:56] how they call
[55:59] it free moral agents he created man on a
[56:02] free moral
[56:04] agent he gives you everything you decide
[56:07] on what to
[56:09] take he told them when you eat of this
[56:13] you're going to
[56:16] die but man
[56:18] took another
[56:23] way here brother Bram says
[56:27] but while God was Ring after creating
[56:30] man but
[56:32] while he was resting and trusting in his
[56:36] Masterpiece his enemy came in and found
[56:40] this Great Masterpiece and he and he by
[56:44] deceit he creeps under the the the
[56:47] gardens walls and then he M he mad this
[56:51] beautiful Masterpiece and mud it so that
[56:54] it fell
[56:58] God had had
[57:00] trust had trust in his
[57:03] Masterpiece but when he had
[57:07] rested the devil crept
[57:10] in and destroyed the
[57:14] Masterpiece but God is
[57:17] God God remains God he never gave up on
[57:22] his Masterpiece he started over and over
[57:28] it's like
[57:29] now we here we all have our backgrounds
[57:34] everyone has his
[57:36] background even the wrers you
[57:39] see even the people you
[57:42] admire all have the their
[57:46] background we all come from a background
[57:49] I may also be coming from a bad
[57:53] background but God didn't give up on me
[57:58] and he's not giving up on
[58:00] you
[58:02] Hallelujah you just have to keep in his
[58:04] presence keep seeking him keep looking
[58:08] for
[58:10] him it's when you're also going to be a
[58:14] masterpiece that is
[58:17] redeemed
[58:22] Hallelujah we see a lot about him the go
[58:27] the person God
[58:30] created here brother Brenham is telling
[58:32] us he trusted in his Masterpiece but the
[58:36] devil came in and and destroyed the
[58:43] Masterpiece it is the same even right
[58:45] now the devil is always creeping in to
[58:49] destroy the master
[58:51] pce but shame upon the Devil Hallelujah
[58:57] because when Christ died for us at the
[58:59] cross we are redeemed
[59:02] forever he paid he pay the price for
[59:07] it it's like when this great arure this
[59:13] great
[59:14] sculpture that Michelangelo was
[59:17] making that that Monument of
[59:22] Moses he made it but when he was making
[59:27] it the ones that were looking at it have
[59:30] asked themselves what is that man doing
[59:33] what is that man trying to do it they
[59:35] may not even see sense in
[59:38] it but the the one who had the
[59:42] vision he knew what he was
[59:46] creating God has the vision he knows
[59:50] what he
[59:52] creating you don't just coming here just
[59:56] because you have to come or you're not
[59:58] listening or you're not living as a
[1:00:00] Christian because you have to live as a
[1:00:03] Christian but God has a purpose to while
[1:00:05] you're
[1:00:09] here and we should
[1:00:12] also listen and hear his word because
[1:00:16] through it when we are going to
[1:00:19] perfect what God is trying to mold
[1:00:22] within us
[1:00:27] at times situations tend to take us
[1:00:32] away life situations tend us tend to
[1:00:35] take us away but when we
[1:00:38] stick on the line of God's word we shall
[1:00:41] surely
[1:00:44] overcome
[1:00:47] Hallelujah yeah you may you you may be
[1:00:50] coming from a broken broken
[1:00:53] background some of you have committed
[1:00:57] really sins that you can even not H to
[1:01:01] people but God has saved you God has
[1:01:05] redeemed you you should not be ashamed
[1:01:08] of who you are right
[1:01:10] now even you should not be ashamed of
[1:01:13] what you were because God changed you
[1:01:17] and I know you cannot go back to that
[1:01:20] that state
[1:01:23] Hallelujah I person I really thank
[1:01:29] God though some of us were born in the
[1:01:32] message we grew up in the
[1:01:36] message we thought maybe that is the way
[1:01:39] to
[1:01:41] go but when you're growing the devil is
[1:01:44] also
[1:01:44] attacking when you grow the devil
[1:01:47] attacks and you you start then there you
[1:01:50] start asking yourself is what I'm having
[1:01:56] really worth
[1:01:58] it most people ask themselves that
[1:02:03] question but I thank God amidst
[1:02:07] everything that came amidst all that
[1:02:10] came in my life I really thank God that
[1:02:13] I still press on that I still know what
[1:02:16] I'm
[1:02:17] holding I really thank God for
[1:02:22] that Hallelujah
[1:02:28] yeah some of us
[1:02:31] here even right now you know
[1:02:35] yourselves you and God know
[1:02:40] yourselves know what is taking place in
[1:02:42] your
[1:02:44] lives it may not be that
[1:02:47] good but thank God you're here thank God
[1:02:51] you're still coming to you still holding
[1:02:53] on that you're still holding on the the
[1:02:55] truth still holding on his word because
[1:02:59] he's the only one that will save you
[1:03:00] he's only God's word that can give life
[1:03:07] you some of you may have even few
[1:03:11] minutes back or hours back you might
[1:03:14] have been doing something bad
[1:03:17] things but thank God you're
[1:03:21] here thank God you're
[1:03:24] here I did not come to I didn't come to
[1:03:27] encourage Sinners that you can knew
[1:03:30] because Grace is still more for
[1:03:37] us but I came to remind
[1:03:42] you
[1:03:44] Hallelujah I came to remind
[1:03:48] you that that
[1:03:51] Grace yes is still there and God is
[1:03:54] still saving and don't give up on
[1:03:56] yourself keep resting on it may not be a
[1:04:00] one day Journey that you can walk but
[1:04:03] keep resting
[1:04:07] on but value that
[1:04:10] Grace value the the grace you have right
[1:04:14] now God is trying to
[1:04:17] bring something in you molding something
[1:04:21] new in you molding back the other
[1:04:24] Masterpiece he had because he he is God
[1:04:30] and he cannot be defeated though the
[1:04:33] devil came in and destroyed the the the
[1:04:36] first Masterpiece he had made but God he
[1:04:39] didn't TR let's see what brother Bram
[1:04:43] says
[1:04:51] here I says in the message the
[1:04:54] masterpiece
[1:04:56] so God in preparing this
[1:04:59] masterpiece here he was building a new
[1:05:04] masterpiece he put it on a foundation of
[1:05:07] the
[1:05:08] Patriots and the and the Patriots
[1:05:10] Foundation First was Abraham and then
[1:05:14] Isaac and then Jacob and then Joseph the
[1:05:17] four the four corners and now Abraham
[1:05:20] was the foundation of
[1:05:22] Faith let's say it had four foundations
[1:05:25] the foundation of Faith was Abraham the
[1:05:28] foundation of love was Isaac the
[1:05:30] foundation of Grace was
[1:05:32] Jacob God's gra God's grace to
[1:05:36] Jacob anyone knows that anyone knows
[1:05:39] that but in Joseph was
[1:05:42] Perfection that is where you you you
[1:05:44] could set the
[1:05:48] monent at first it
[1:05:50] was it was do this or do if you don't do
[1:05:54] this this and this this if you don't do
[1:05:56] this or I I will not do this if you
[1:05:59] don't do this I will not do this it was
[1:06:02] lws but we thank God that He gave us the
[1:06:07] grace he built more he built again the
[1:06:10] foundation on love if he build the
[1:06:13] foundation again on Grace he build the
[1:06:16] foundation again on faith when you
[1:06:19] believe in God as the word says faith
[1:06:23] comes by hearing and hearing the word of
[1:06:27] God you not just develop that Faith you
[1:06:31] you have to continue listening hearing
[1:06:33] the word of God attending to it giving
[1:06:36] it more time then the faith will come
[1:06:40] that is one of the foundations building
[1:06:42] a masterpiece what Masterpiece the
[1:06:47] bride Hallelujah the
[1:06:49] bride he's building a new masterace
[1:06:57] but in the Old
[1:07:00] Testament all they are built on if you
[1:07:05] don't do this this will happen if you
[1:07:07] don't do this it was
[1:07:10] lost but now he has given us
[1:07:13] Grace look at
[1:07:15] Jacob he was a
[1:07:18] supplanter he was a liar he was
[1:07:21] everything he also knew himself
[1:07:25] I think all of you remember the day when
[1:07:27] he cried he said I'll will not leave
[1:07:29] this Angel before you change my
[1:07:32] name because he knew his his status he
[1:07:36] knew what was in him so you should you
[1:07:40] also know know what is in you you also
[1:07:42] know what you
[1:07:44] do but hold on to the angel hold on to
[1:07:48] the angel hold on to the word of God
[1:07:52] hallelujah that word will change you
[1:07:55] that word will give you life that word
[1:07:58] will give you a peace of
[1:08:02] mind sometimes you ask ourselves what am
[1:08:04] I going to do what am I this and this
[1:08:07] I'm trying my level best yes we are
[1:08:09] trying all of us but we do not try by
[1:08:12] our our energy or by by our our thinking
[1:08:16] or by anything or by our
[1:08:20] intellectual we try because of God's
[1:08:23] grace because of those the the
[1:08:26] foundation he built on building a new
[1:08:29] masterpiece he's building a
[1:08:33] bride he's building
[1:08:36] you
[1:08:40] Hallelujah think of
[1:08:45] that at times people just come just they
[1:08:49] always just come to church because my
[1:08:52] friend will papor will not see me at
[1:08:55] church and ask me my father will not see
[1:08:57] me at Church my this and this will not H
[1:09:02] leave
[1:09:04] that because every
[1:09:08] individual receives salvation on an
[1:09:10] individual
[1:09:12] basis would do not inherit
[1:09:16] salvation you receive it on an
[1:09:20] individual basis God does not have
[1:09:23] grandchildren he does not have may this
[1:09:26] is a young child or this and this or
[1:09:30] what and
[1:09:31] what but he comes to you
[1:09:39] personally
[1:09:41] Hallelujah but though he comes
[1:09:45] personally we always have to also stand
[1:09:48] with our brothers and
[1:09:50] sisters we also have to keep our
[1:09:53] brothers
[1:09:56] keep keeping them always encouraging
[1:09:59] them to also take take the way because
[1:10:04] it's not easy taking it
[1:10:06] alone sometimes we BL we blame a lot uh
[1:10:10] our brothers and sisters that this and
[1:10:13] this he cannot leave
[1:10:16] this
[1:10:18] but it
[1:10:24] is e
[1:10:57] don't most people because we are not on
[1:10:59] the same level most people tend to be
[1:11:01] more spiritual and criticize others that
[1:11:04] are also growing in the
[1:11:07] faith it is a journey my
[1:11:10] brother encourage your sister encourage
[1:11:12] your brother is a
[1:11:24] journey when I really think about it I
[1:11:27] really ask God to forgive me at times we
[1:11:30] tend to to to blame people so
[1:11:35] much but instead of blaming encourage
[1:11:38] your brother love your brother because
[1:11:41] it is only love that will help us keep
[1:11:44] pring on help our brother when you see a
[1:11:47] brother doing something
[1:11:49] wrong don't rebuke so much because you
[1:11:52] also once in that state
[1:11:58] Hallelujah sometimes we tend to forget
[1:12:00] where we came
[1:12:03] from I know where I came from I know
[1:12:07] what I I have been doing I know what I
[1:12:10] did and when I see a brother sometimes
[1:12:13] doing it I just feel the love of praying
[1:12:18] for that brother praying for that sister
[1:12:21] it's all that will keep us moving it's
[1:12:24] all that will build the
[1:12:28] bride you're not going to be the bride
[1:12:31] the bride of Christ
[1:12:34] Alone you're just pieces
[1:12:37] pieces that make up the
[1:12:40] bride so when you push away your
[1:12:45] brother I don't
[1:12:47] know you're breaking more your
[1:12:50] brother into more pieces that will not
[1:12:52] be even that will take long
[1:12:56] to be again brought back into one one
[1:13:01] piece
[1:13:09] Hallelujah but here in uh he promised he
[1:13:13] was starting a new
[1:13:17] masterpiece as you see in the on the day
[1:13:19] of
[1:13:21] Pentecost everything
[1:13:23] was was down
[1:13:27] everything the devil had tried so much
[1:13:31] to destroy
[1:13:33] it he started building up a new
[1:13:42] masterpiece many were broken into small
[1:13:46] small pieces but is bringing those small
[1:13:50] pieces through generations as you see it
[1:13:54] started e
[1:14:30] let us read in
[1:14:31] uh in Jeremiah chapter 18 verse 1- 16 to
[1:14:42] 6 song leader because you see a brother
[1:14:45] song leading you want to be this uh some
[1:14:49] great person in church you want to be
[1:14:51] some great person in the village HH but
[1:14:54] not everyone
[1:14:55] is going to be that great person
[1:15:21] leave like now someone who
[1:15:45] the right
[1:15:47] position sometimes God is mold are
[1:15:50] broken he's molding them back to the
[1:15:53] whole uh to to to a hole
[1:15:56] and it is painful sometimes but leave it
[1:16:00] for the
[1:16:01] porter it's a way to go when you
[1:16:04] try to to obstruct the porter you may
[1:16:09] become
[1:16:13] lame
[1:16:16] hallelujah how many like lame
[1:16:21] people how many here
[1:16:28] I see all of you do not like them
[1:16:31] because there's a way you look all of us
[1:16:34] do not like
[1:16:36] them isn't
[1:16:38] it so how many want to be
[1:16:43] lame if there's no
[1:16:46] one let the word of God work on you let
[1:16:50] God work on you let God mold the
[1:16:53] pieces
[1:16:55] hallelujah
[1:16:57] hallelujah let God mold you let God mold
[1:17:01] out what he seeing in you because you're
[1:17:04] not the holder of the vision he created
[1:17:07] us he knew what he wanted us to be he
[1:17:10] knew what you want he wants you to
[1:17:12] be you may not be like me I may not be
[1:17:16] like
[1:17:17] you some people like God has made people
[1:17:20] different in different kinds some people
[1:17:23] are soft in life some people are
[1:17:28] rough and people have nothing to do
[1:17:30] about
[1:17:31] it because is the nature he has some
[1:17:35] people are very fast in doing things
[1:17:37] some are slow
[1:17:40] some but all we leave it to God there
[1:17:42] has a reason sometimes why he does that
[1:17:45] thing
[1:17:47] Hallelujah so leave the
[1:17:50] pieces to God to make them a whole
[1:17:56] you may be going through difficult
[1:17:58] situations but leave the the situations
[1:18:01] leave all those that are breaking you
[1:18:03] leave all those to
[1:18:08] him he may break you he may break some
[1:18:11] something on you to mold a better thing
[1:18:14] on
[1:18:15] you sometimes we we we we become annoyed
[1:18:19] we start complaining to God about some
[1:18:22] things that are happening in our lives
[1:18:24] about things that are happening that
[1:18:26] Lord why is it taking long I'm not
[1:18:28] getting rich I'm not getting this and
[1:18:30] this but why why why sometimes we should
[1:18:34] not ask a
[1:18:36] lot because it takes a
[1:18:40] process a process to build up
[1:18:46] something brother brother Bram talks
[1:18:48] about those people that like
[1:18:51] uh that overnight riching
[1:18:58] is most people like such things like
[1:19:01] good things to come very first like
[1:19:04] nothing but all those good things have a
[1:19:07] process have a
[1:19:11] process so he's molding even right now
[1:19:14] he's molding me he's molding
[1:19:18] you it may seem too long for you it may
[1:19:22] seem so difficult for you but leave the
[1:19:25] pieces for God to mold
[1:19:29] them some people have even given up on
[1:19:32] themselves saying for me I'm a total
[1:19:35] sinner for me I I fa I failed I cannot
[1:19:39] try to do
[1:19:41] this but when you leave everything to
[1:19:44] God when you say God I really I I really
[1:19:48] cannot manage this and you're truly
[1:19:51] genuine with God
[1:19:55] you'll
[1:19:56] see even the things that were so hard
[1:19:59] for you to
[1:20:00] do you're now doing them someone could
[1:20:04] not pray for an hour you can now pray
[1:20:07] for even more than an hour ask yourself
[1:20:10] what
[1:20:13] happened Leave the Pieces to go to mold
[1:20:17] them don't give up on yourselves keep
[1:20:21] resing on we all we all go through abs
[1:20:24] and down and downs at times when you're
[1:20:26] down very down you feel most of us feel
[1:20:30] it that I'm really down but what do you
[1:20:33] do in that state do you just leave the
[1:20:34] state to continue just keep crying like
[1:20:37] Jacob he CED dear God help me change my
[1:20:41] status change my my my my everything
[1:20:46] change me change my
[1:20:48] name it's so we also have to do those
[1:20:51] are our fathers we look at
[1:20:53] them as you see
[1:20:56] here Jacob represented
[1:20:59] Grace truly when you read about Jacob he
[1:21:03] was not that good but God changed them
[1:21:08] look at
[1:21:10] Samson he was broken pieces before his
[1:21:15] enemies when they removed his eyes they
[1:21:17] cut his Red Rocks he was nothing they
[1:21:21] criticized him they said now where is
[1:21:24] your god
[1:21:25] but Samson what he
[1:21:30] did gave him victory at the
[1:21:33] end
[1:21:36] Hallelujah he just said God help me once
[1:21:40] again at least let me die with my
[1:21:43] enemies you should have that that that
[1:21:46] that in in you tell God I want to die
[1:21:50] with my enemies at
[1:21:52] least if I cannot die right let me die
[1:21:55] with my enemies
[1:21:58] fighting with my
[1:22:02] enemies you see
[1:22:06] Samson he was engaged into very many
[1:22:08] things we all know he was taken up by L
[1:22:13] with the girls
[1:22:18] DEA we also go through them sometimes
[1:22:22] some are even going through them right
[1:22:23] now
[1:22:25] youve Fallen you just have no that power
[1:22:28] that God gave you as a
[1:22:30] Believer but don't give up on
[1:22:34] yourself when you do not give up on
[1:22:38] yourself God is Resto will restore you
[1:22:42] slowly by
[1:22:45] slowly Samson reached at a
[1:22:48] point that even the kids will laugh at
[1:22:51] him imagine a great man imagine a belie
[1:22:55] you're there in the world and the ones
[1:22:58] that you used to preach to are now
[1:23:00] looking at you saying now what were you
[1:23:03] preaching what were you telling
[1:23:06] us you even get ashamed of
[1:23:12] yourself but when you do not give up on
[1:23:16] yourself God is going to build you
[1:23:19] again but I do not encourage
[1:23:23] Sinners sometimes may say ah God is
[1:23:25] building me let me continue doing this
[1:23:28] and this God is building me
[1:23:34] no because even go when God is building
[1:23:37] you it takes even
[1:23:39] you to get desperate for it at god build
[1:23:43] me God change me God do this and this
[1:23:46] help me change my my
[1:23:49] everything change my ways change
[1:23:51] everything you may continue doing them
[1:23:54] you may on you in the process doing
[1:23:58] something but when you're desperate on
[1:24:00] changing
[1:24:02] it that is
[1:24:04] the the issue in
[1:24:07] it when you're
[1:24:09] desperate it's where God starts from but
[1:24:13] some people are are comfortable that ah
[1:24:16] God knows things are not
[1:24:22] easy don't be comfortable in that state
[1:24:24] you are
[1:24:29] in even if you don't want to pray at
[1:24:34] least
[1:24:36] sometimes I feel sometimes I I was down
[1:24:39] I wouldn't
[1:24:40] pray but I when I was in my bed I said
[1:24:45] ah when I do not
[1:24:46] pray where will I
[1:24:49] be prayer is the only strength the the
[1:24:53] only greatest God has given us it's
[1:24:56] where everything changes I started
[1:24:59] asking myself when I was in my
[1:25:01] bed I said when I do not pray what will
[1:25:05] happen to me the devil may creep in so I
[1:25:08] started when I was on my bed still
[1:25:11] sleeping I started praying Slowly by
[1:25:14] slowly I sat on my bed
[1:25:17] now after some time I had the the
[1:25:20] strength of
[1:25:21] praying but if I didn't
[1:25:25] now what would happen I would sleep I
[1:25:27] would sleep throughout the night I I
[1:25:30] failed at times we give up very
[1:25:34] quickly just I cannot manage I cannot
[1:25:37] manage this and this I cannot
[1:25:43] manage but it's up to you giving
[1:25:49] up when you give up it's where the
[1:25:52] trouble starts from
[1:25:59] Hallelujah carry all your broken pieces
[1:26:04] to God and put them before him and say
[1:26:07] God I'm really
[1:26:09] tired I'm really tired may you change
[1:26:13] me it may be a long
[1:26:16] process it may be a long process to
[1:26:19] leave all your
[1:26:22] addictions it may be a long process to
[1:26:25] leave your Monga it may be a long
[1:26:28] process to leave your lying it may be a
[1:26:32] long
[1:26:33] process but when you're desperate about
[1:26:36] it God will build up the pieces that you
[1:26:41] feel cannot join to help you overcome
[1:26:44] and
[1:26:47] overcome to me I will give a living
[1:26:52] testimony though I was born in the
[1:26:56] message I didn't
[1:26:58] leave in the message
[1:27:02] only I re I reached at a
[1:27:05] point that I didn't value what I
[1:27:11] had because I had not met God I
[1:27:17] myself I reached at the point I would go
[1:27:19] to church because of my
[1:27:21] parents but I didn't have the strength
[1:27:23] of going
[1:27:25] there I reach at church and
[1:27:29] those I feel whatever they telling me is
[1:27:31] a bit
[1:27:35] boring but when you are
[1:27:38] seed of
[1:27:40] God however much you run away from God
[1:27:44] however much you feel I'm not
[1:27:47] worthy God still holds you he still has
[1:27:51] you in his hands
[1:27:55] I when they would preach the word and I
[1:27:57] hear a bit of it when I was not doing ah
[1:28:00] it would strike me very hard I go back
[1:28:03] home think about
[1:28:05] it that week I would keep thinking about
[1:28:08] it I'd pray God help me help me live as
[1:28:12] the word says help me do this and
[1:28:16] this but it started all with me the
[1:28:21] desperation though I didn't have the the
[1:28:23] the energy to to to overcome all the
[1:28:27] energy to fight the devil in some
[1:28:29] circumstances but started with me I said
[1:28:33] God help me change this I know it is not
[1:28:36] good I but some people are comfortable
[1:28:39] with what they they
[1:28:42] have year to year yeah to year a person
[1:28:45] does not change is the
[1:28:49] same and see living a life that is not
[1:28:52] good
[1:28:55] just because they do not give the pieces
[1:28:57] to
[1:28:58] God give the pie all the pieces to
[1:29:03] God he will mold you he will mold you
[1:29:06] back to what he had in mind to why you
[1:29:11] here have you ever asked yourself why
[1:29:13] you you you you in this world did you
[1:29:16] just come to die and then
[1:29:19] go you have a purpose to why you here
[1:29:25] do you know why Michael Angel was Mo
[1:29:28] was he was making that piece of
[1:29:34] Moses he reached at a point he stried it
[1:29:39] because he believed in it he believed in
[1:29:43] what he was making he had a vision on
[1:29:45] what he was
[1:29:48] making so God created us for a purpose
[1:29:52] Hallelujah he created us to serve some
[1:29:57] purpose you not here just to live and
[1:30:02] die have you ever asked yourself why you
[1:30:06] here did you just come to suffer in this
[1:30:12] world everyone has a purpose to why he's
[1:30:18] here ask God why did you bring me here
[1:30:21] you have a purose why I'm here
[1:30:27] but we all know there's one purpose that
[1:30:29] is uniform to
[1:30:31] us to why God created us he created us
[1:30:35] to worship
[1:30:37] Him
[1:30:41] Hallelujah worship him with all our
[1:30:43] heart with all our mind with all our
[1:30:48] strength Hallelujah
[1:30:54] may we leave that
[1:30:57] purpose you may have even other purposes
[1:30:59] God has created you
[1:31:01] for but that is uniform to us worshiping
[1:31:04] him he created all humans to worship
[1:31:08] Him
[1:31:11] Hallelujah you may feel very
[1:31:14] dry but we remember in
[1:31:21] Ezekiel God sent e Ezekiel
[1:31:25] he told him prophesy to these
[1:31:29] bones that they can come back to
[1:31:32] life let let us read there Ezekiel
[1:31:36] chapter 3
[1:31:47] 38 38 verse no it is 37 verse verse
[1:32:02] 1-6 it says the hand of the Lord was
[1:32:06] upon me and carried me out in the spirit
[1:32:09] of the Lord and set me down in the midst
[1:32:12] of the valley which was full of Bones
[1:32:15] and caused me to pass by them round
[1:32:18] about and behold there was very many in
[1:32:21] the open Valley and low they were very
[1:32:25] dry they were very dry and he said unto
[1:32:28] me son of man can these bones
[1:32:31] live and I answered oh l oh Lord God
[1:32:35] thou
[1:32:37] knowest again he said unto me prophesy
[1:32:41] upon these bones and
[1:32:44] say unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear the
[1:32:47] word of the
[1:32:49] Lord thus says the Lord unto thee bones
[1:32:53] behold hold that will cause breath to
[1:32:55] enter into you and you shall
[1:33:00] live and I will
[1:33:04] lay s
[1:33:09] news excuse
[1:33:21] me and our Lay News upon you and will
[1:33:25] bring up Flesh on you and cover you with
[1:33:28] skin and put breath in you and he shall
[1:33:31] live and he shall know that I am the
[1:33:35] Lord
[1:33:37] hallelujah you may be the dry bones
[1:33:39] right now you may look at yourself as a
[1:33:42] heap of dry bones you may look at at
[1:33:45] yourself as a heap of
[1:33:47] nonsense you may look at yourself at a
[1:33:50] as a heap of nothing you're nothing
[1:33:56] but if God BR gave life back to the dry
[1:34:01] bones do you think he can give up on you
[1:34:05] he can never give up on
[1:34:07] you he created you for a purpose and the
[1:34:10] purpose has to be complished
[1:34:16] Hallelujah don't allow that
[1:34:19] situation don't allow don't obey to
[1:34:22] it so said no I was not created for this
[1:34:26] I was not created to do this I was
[1:34:29] created to serve God I was created to be
[1:34:32] an example as created to live God's
[1:34:36] word
[1:34:38] hallelujah don't allow the situation to
[1:34:40] sit on
[1:34:43] you here brother Bram says in the
[1:34:46] message
[1:34:47] persevering a real
[1:34:50] Christian fights for his
[1:34:52] position he has to stand
[1:34:55] alone him and God and he fights every
[1:34:58] inch of ground so you do not have to
[1:35:02] Baby them
[1:35:06] around at times our
[1:35:10] pastors take
[1:35:12] us and saying no us leave this person
[1:35:17] leave this and this but the here the
[1:35:20] prophet says you do not baby them
[1:35:24] though we are going through you may be
[1:35:25] going through that tough situation that
[1:35:27] you are not living
[1:35:29] righteously but we are not we are not
[1:35:31] trying to they're not trying to babysit
[1:35:34] you that you can remain in
[1:35:37] church it may be a short time of
[1:35:42] Grace that you
[1:35:44] have and you lose it
[1:35:47] out but here we see every Christian
[1:35:52] fights every inch
[1:35:55] as you see Joshua and calib when they
[1:35:57] were when they were fighting for the
[1:35:59] promised
[1:36:01] land they God told
[1:36:03] them every step you'll take it will be
[1:36:07] yours every inch you'll take it will be
[1:36:11] yours why did why did God say that yet
[1:36:14] you had the energy to just kill all the
[1:36:17] what were
[1:36:18] there sometimes you go through to Value
[1:36:22] what you have
[1:36:24] to Value the truth you
[1:36:26] have to Value God's
[1:36:31] word if I just give you this hotel that
[1:36:35] if M gives you this hotel that from
[1:36:37] today and onwards this is
[1:36:40] yours I think you may eat money and say
[1:36:43] ah now I'm going to just sleep wake up
[1:36:46] eat my money again
[1:36:49] sleep but do we sleeping every day
[1:36:53] because he
[1:36:58] knows and that's how all things are
[1:37:00] going even your Christian Life when you
[1:37:03] you
[1:37:04] sleep you
[1:37:07] deteriorate you start losing your
[1:37:13] power
[1:37:14] Hallelujah so let us stand for our let
[1:37:18] us stand and fight for our positions
[1:37:24] let us stand like Joshua and
[1:37:27] calib you also ask God where is my
[1:37:31] Mountain what is it give me my Mountain
[1:37:33] you promis this and this you have
[1:37:36] confidence of asking God God you promis
[1:37:38] me this and this you promise me that
[1:37:41] you'll be with me you promise me the
[1:37:44] Holy Spirit you promise
[1:37:47] me because you'll have confidence you'll
[1:37:50] have confidence in you that what
[1:37:53] whatever you're asking it really
[1:37:55] deserves to be
[1:37:58] yours but how can you come to ask God
[1:38:01] something even you're not worthy of that
[1:38:04] God give me the Holy Spirit ah and then
[1:38:07] you you're just there living your life
[1:38:10] the way you want you think God will give
[1:38:12] it to
[1:38:14] you you're not desperate for it you
[1:38:16] think God will give it to you
[1:38:23] you have to just be desperate you ask
[1:38:26] God like the man who was asking God to
[1:38:29] to fill him the holy spirit is that God
[1:38:31] when you do not fill me the Holy Spirit
[1:38:33] you'll find the Heap of my bones here he
[1:38:36] was
[1:38:39] desperate but we should not
[1:38:42] forget that he's not about all Us by the
[1:38:46] grace of
[1:38:49] God though even the desperation you have
[1:38:53] it is God's
[1:38:56] grace but some people sometimes even
[1:38:59] people go beyond the
[1:39:04] grace shall we live in sin because of
[1:39:08] that Grace will
[1:39:11] abound some people just take it for
[1:39:19] granted know what you're
[1:39:22] holding Hallelujah
[1:39:24] know what you're
[1:39:26] holding and then God will help you go
[1:39:29] through difficult situations go through
[1:39:31] even things that you cannot manage
[1:39:33] yourself from I have seen it some things
[1:39:37] I could not even
[1:39:39] overcome but when I said God here I am
[1:39:43] do whatever you want to
[1:39:46] do and God really did something because
[1:39:50] I was really desperate for it I said God
[1:39:53] change my
[1:39:54] life how can I always come to church and
[1:39:57] my life is still like this how can I
[1:40:00] always come to church and I'm still
[1:40:01] lying how can I always come to church
[1:40:04] and I'm still doing this and
[1:40:11] this think of
[1:40:17] that when you're right with
[1:40:22] God he will will help you through

[1:55:59] brother Dan may God bless you for
[1:56:01] yielding
[1:56:03] yourself before we pray I just want to
[1:56:06] read something
[1:56:10] here bam says the message desperation as
[1:56:13] the minister was
[1:56:15] preaching uh he was touching about
[1:56:19] insiration he said that the sign of the
[1:56:21] coming the sign of of his coming should
[1:56:23] throw every member of Christ into
[1:56:26] desperation now about our soul about our
[1:56:30] welfare for Hereafter well what are we
[1:56:34] going to
[1:56:35] amount to if we gain the whole world
[1:56:40] Amen and it says in desperation
[1:56:43] paragraph 170 that remember
[1:56:46] desperation see what desperation will do
[1:56:49] desperation will drive across the sea

[1:56:54] will drive you from another state

[1:57:01] precious old father and his daughter
[1:57:03] with desperation try to get in come in
[1:57:07] every everything else and sit
[1:57:11] down and he continue to say that I
[1:57:13] believe that the reason we don't have
[1:57:15] desperation is because it is lack of
[1:57:19] love God the love of God
[1:57:23] I think that is the love of God that I
[1:57:26] think the love of God causes desperation
[1:57:29] and if God is in your heart the
[1:57:32] [Music]
