of Grace this evening Lord Jesus for the grace you have G [Music] for [Music] fore [Music] fore fore for for amen we are also reading uh Isaiah chapter 65: 24 it says that and it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer and while they are yet speaking I will hear precious Lord Jesus we thank you for the portion of the scripture we have read this evening Lord we ask you to come and give me the inspiration May Inspire us Inspire the congregation tonight father in this few minutes we are going to spend here Lord we ask you that God you will come and Lord open our understanding that by the end of the service we shall speak like those Fells that didn't our heart burn within us when you were speaking to us precious father may this word find uh fertile ground in our soul that Lord Jesus will bring forth fruit loving master in 50 fold and 100 fold father we thank you because thou as Lord you've heard our prayers in Jes Jesus name we pray amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen yeah I was wondering what to uh talk about this evening but by the grace of God I just have something that I want us to share we're going to talk about prayer because we have come to pray amen amen yeah I believe uh very many people very many ministers and Servants of God talk of the reformers the prophets and you find and different people they have taken someone or subject about prayer and you know we cannot exhaust prayer amen amen because our Prophet tells us we can read the word we can sing so much we can jump too much we can shout but we'll never pray too much amen and remember uh uh Jesus Christ told us always to pray without ceasing amen he told us always to pray without ceasing that's why every Friday we come here every Wednesday every Sunday at our homes our workplace amen so because uh the strength of uh the believer is in prayer blessed be the name of the Lord and you will see where brother Wanga read for us in James uh the Bible tells us about some uh still about prayer and this evening I would call my text that God answers prayer amen amen the only language that God knows is prayer blessed be the name of the Lord and that's why in James uh uh he told us the same thing is there anyone amidst us who is Afflicted he does not tell us to go and do something different but is there someone who's lacking this amen amen he tells us to pray blessed be the name of the Lord that's where our strength is and even here in Isaiah he says in Isaiah 65: 24 that it shall come to pass pass amen 23 say that they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the Blessed of the Lord and their offspring with them it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer this calling it is in prayer blessed be the name of the Lord and while they yet they are yet speaking I will hear amen blessed be the name of the Lord am before even you start praying God knows your need amen but still regardless of him knowing our need he want us to tell him about it that's why the Bible tells us that we should make our request known before God in prayers and supplication amen blessed be the name of the Lord I remember one time we uh shared about almost this very thing and we said that if a child go to the father and you just look at your father in the face like you are quiet you just you just looking at him do you think he will respond he will ask whether you whether you okay blessed be the name of the Lord and also the way we approach I had some other like what I what I thought that I talked about this evening about something about to worship I was reading the Bible and I realized that when God spoke to Abraham in Genesis 22 and told him to go and offer his son do you know that the journey to mount Mariah it was 3 days joury blessed be the name of the Lord it never happened instantly but God told him God knew very well that this man was going to work for three days so God gave him time to think about it blessed be the name of the Lord because remember Abraham kept that secret even from from his wife Abraham never told sah that he was going to offer Isaac Blessed Be the name of the Lord but I believe this man had prayed amen because for the time he waited on God to receive that promised son he waited enough blessed be the name of the Lord and he was so sure that God was more than able to resurrect his son praise be to God and you see God gave him three days this man was going to offer his son the same God God who told him to leave his people 50 years ago that same God came back again to test his faith this time round is by him offering his son and still the man's Faith was solid what kept Abraham going it was because Abraham was in the presence of God Amen he kept himself always praying blessed be the name of the Lord and here uh there is a quote here uh in the message trying to do God a service trying to do God a service without being the will of God the prophet say that notice David he got the Revelation and noticed it was not the prophet nathanel that got the Revelation it was David the king that got the Revelation neither was nathanel consulted about it he never asked nathanel but did you see here in the first Chronicles he consulted the captain of the thousand and the captain of the hundreds and he never consulted nathanel he consulted the people in the days of Soul they left off Consulting God Amen remember sa bad he was a l king but the ark and the UR th they left off doing that David say now let us get back to God all of us and let us get back to the right thing let us go down and get the ark bring it here bring the presence of God in other words in the city let us hold a Revival let us bring people back but he got the Revelation which seems to be good but it wasn't the will of God instead of asking the source that he should have asked he consulted his captain because he had just become a king blessed be the name of the Lord when David got this Revelation he was supposed to go and consult God In Prayer or go consult the king King because the word of or the prophet rather because the word of God comes to the prophet blessed be the name of the Lord the reason asked why we quote the message it is because we believe that the messenger of this age amen amen he was a Vindicated prophet of God and we are reading from him because this the word from God blessed be the name of the Lord and here the prophet say that David made a mistake because instead of Consulting the prophet he went and consulted the people blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen and uh if we go back to James let us go back to James we read James chapter 5 okay praise be to God Amen [Music] James chapter 5 he says that uh if you read nine from nine says that Grudge not one against another Brethren L you be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door take my brethren the prophet who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering Affliction and patience behold we count them happy which endureth yeah have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mind meres but Above All Things my brethren swear not neither by heaven or by Earth neither by any other oath but let let your be and your be L you fall into condemnation is any among you Afflicted let him pray is any Mary let him see PSS is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord amen the only way to go as Christian is the prayer way do we have any answer we want from God the Bible tells us to pray do we have any need we have it tells us to pray and this evening I'm telling you that the answer is only in prayer oh God answers prayer amen is there anything we need tonight in our life in our homes in whatever we are doing it tells us to pray blessed be the name of the Lord he says confess your fault one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed still you pray you confess your faults one to another and then you pray one to another when a brother confesses is false to you it means or it tells you to pray with him amen but not to carry it and you move every house every door every window every tree everywhere blessed be the name of the Lord but it tells you the Bible tells us we confess our faults one to another that we may be healed amen and we pray one for another we are very sometime we find ourself wanting in this area we don't pray one for another blessed be the name of the the Lord amen and when we are praying one for another it doesn't mean I pray for brother long God may you help him in the name of Jesus Christ I pray for Brother Joseph really blessed be the name of the Lord we have to mean business with God you pray for him you pray for his life pray for his ministry pray for his family pray for his business amen that's how we pray one for another and Bam tells say that when we are praying one for another we are taking a med seat amen you are taking the place of Jesus interceding for your brother amen when we when we are interceding one for another we are taking the place of Jesus Christ blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen and he say that effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man a veth much amen praise be to God am Elias was a man subject like passion as we are in fact we are just reminding ourself here it tells us of Elijah Elijah he was just like us full of weaknesses sometime when we hear or when we read of The Heroes of Faith we think they were great men and if you look at the the mental perception of the world today if you look at the picture of Samson they draw they take today man with bunch of muscles man with six packs amen but our Prophet tells us that Samson was just ordinary man like any man but what made difference was the spirit of God upon Samson amen look at Jesus Jesus was not giant like he was not a mascular man he was just simple man amen amen but when is Under The anointing that was different story blessed be the name of the Lord and the prophet tells us that anointing upon Samson is what did wonders amen when the anointing could come upon him that was all that Samson needed and what you need tonight what the church need today is the anointing of the Holy Ghost blessed be the name of the Lord and that anointing must come inside outwardly praise be to God amen elah was just an ordinary man like any of us but one day he met the king and spoke just like I'm speaking to you and told the king it will not reain for three and a half years blessed be the name of the Lord he had the key of Faith blessed be the name of the Lord because the Bible says whosoever comes to God Must Believe first of all you must believe that he is and he is the rewarder of those who seek at him diligently this man had Faith this man had God this man knew what he was talking about blessed be the name of the Lord and the King maybe thought that this man was joking when he told him that it will not rain for 3 and A2 years that says that not rain for three and A2 years he got the key put in his pocket and left blessed be the name of the Lord and maybe that very day blessed be the name of the Lord because remember amen whosoever comes to God must be tested you must be tried amen your faith must be tried do you think his God did not try his faith God did try his faith praise be to God I believe that evening he was seated in his [Applause] room and this is a man who's just from stopping rain for three and a half years but in just 10 minutes down the road blessed be the name of the Lord but this man knew what he was talking about he had met God praise be to God he had prayed amen and God had told him it will not rain praise be to God but the man had closed the rain he knew that the answer was any prayer he had prayed and God had answered his prayer praise be to God one day two day three 1 month 5 month 6 month do you know what it means it not rain for three and a half years am because when God speaks it is different from what man says amen I believe God commanded even the river praise be to God one year second year but the Bible tells us this man was full of weakness like us amen he was a man subjected to Passion as we are he prayed honestly that it might not rain and it rain not on Earth by the space of 3 3 years and six months he prayed earnestly do you pray honestly do we pray honestly blessed be the name of the Lord and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the Earth brought forth of her fruit Brethren if any of you do error from the truth and one convert him let him know that he which converted The Sinner from the eror of his ways shall save a soul from death and shall hide multitude of sin blessed be the name of the Lord am amen and listen to what the prophet says in the message uh the message blind Bas he says never turn a shoulder or a cold shoulder to anyone no matter what it is even if they have mistreated you never turn a shoulder or a cold shoulder to anyone no matter what it is even if they have mistreated you do it anyhow if you can't do it from your heart then you ow to come to the Altar and stay till the spirit comes in you amen that is from your heart am if you can't worship from your heart amen stay come to the altar pray until that worship comes from your heart blessed be the name of the Lord sister for amen praise be to God you can love those who doesn't love you and that is when God will answer your prayer do you have someone who does not love you who speak ill about you every time do you love that person do you love that brother blessed be the name of the Lord because remember the answer is in prayer God answers prayer amen but there are condition blessed be the name of the Lord amen you can love those who does not love you and that is when God will answer your prayer for as long long as there is anything in your heart if I conceive iniquity in my heart then God will not hear me blessed be the name of the Lord am do you know that sometime yes now you that person hurts you you don't even know where you hurt the person oh when to the extent that even greeting God bless you is like God bless you then you're like of course you can easily sense when someone is indifferent or blessed be the name of the Lord but here he tells us for as long as there's anything in your heart if I conceive iniquity in my heart then God will not hear you the only way God will hear us is when we come before God and we surrender ourself amen like you have come tonight you pour your heart before God when you have not concealed any iniquity in your heart blessed be the name of the Lord praise be to God praise be to God Amen the effectual fent the effectual fervent that is desperation effectual fent prayer of the righteous man availeth much prayer with desperation with consistency when a writer man a good man gets in travail or Soul travail amen that's when something happens am the righteousness of God in us we must be desperate it is desperation that brings out the result it's that desperation that brings that consistency the reason asked why every time you want you come to church is because have something in your heart you are longing for something in in your soul and you are crying to get somewhere in your soul blessed be the name of the Lord amen and that is the soul travail in fact a Christian without Soul travail you are a religious person what makes the difference it is that travail of the Soul everybody goes to church it's a custom in the days we are living in and the Bible says they have form of godliness they just have form just they have a packaging of religious nameb only good names praise be to God amen amen but you must have something in your soul in fact what will keep you going what will keep me going it is that Trav veil of the Soul am because every time you check yourself according to the word you are longing to get somewhere you are longing to reach somewhere in the spirit praise be to God and the only way you you will get somewhere it is in prayer praise be to God and each time we come before God we must be losing something and gaining from God praise be to God when you come with 10 chains at least go with some are broken if not all of them but because we don't want to get a away like to get uh we always want to stand on God's way blessed be the name of the Lord because if you look at worship the worshiping in spirit or the true worship you have to get out of the way amen you have to tear this flesh you have to surrender your desire you have to surrender your feelings sometime we don't want to talk about our feelings you come to church with your feelings say I wish they know how I feel I wish Pastor could understand what he's talking about let me tell you the Holy Spirit understand what you are talking about amen but you have to lay down your feeling you have to put your indifference aside amen for God to operate in your life amen that's right the church is praising and you're not clapping and you think it is okay brother swallow your pride put it aside and worship God Amen something think that they helping song leader you are not helping me because for me I'm worshiping God Amen I'm doing my best to please my master Hallelujah let us clap our hands and you're like but when that soul is undergoing travail blessed be the name of the Lord travail of the soul is like birth pain when the mother is undergoing birth pain all the focus will be on what is coming out blessed be the name of the Lord because there is something going on there's something happening amen she's undergoing desperation she's just praying when okay fine I have the other day just today I was coming to church in the morning and I was passing VI the hospital and there was a lady she was undergoing birth pain because she was like moving around around the hospital comp there is something that was going on blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen so when you have soul travail that will push you to prayer amen and that's what we need praise to God knowing that when you come to church come because there is some Force inside you that pushes you to come for church when you're lifting your hands lift them up because you are not lifting it uh it up to the minister but is to God Amen oh to thee Lord I Surrender Hallelujah open your heart surrender to God Amen shout cry out to God lift up your voice and sing to him blessed be the name of the Lord am that time I went to see brother moazi and I looked at the condition he was in and I was like you know when you go and meet a sick person that's when realize that you don't appreciate God enough he could hardly turn they just had to turn him he was in pain and you find a Believer seated in church but I'm speaking reality because the true worshippers Jesus say now the time has come when the true worshippers will worship God in Sp spirit and in the truth in the Old Testament they used to lift their hands they used to stand lift their hands but here Jesus says that now amen time has come they will no longer go to Mountain to worship but the true worshippers are going to worship that God in spirit and in truth and sometime when we look at ourself we wonder whether we are true worshippers oh we are Jokers you find them when they're out there they speak like machine guns from you even demonstrate your stories but let them come to church they are like wheelie barrows what is wrong where is the problem Church blessed be the name of the Lord but let that person be in prayer there and you not going to get anything from God till you get desperate about it you will not get anything from God and I will not until you are desperate about it you will not even receive the Holy Spirit until you are desperate for it amen you will never even get a sister until you are desperate that's right you will never get anywhere in spirit until you are desperate amen play your games but I'm telling you this evening if we want to get somewhere we must be desperate amen amen we must be on our tip toes because that's where God want to meet us when Moses was raring the Sheep amen it was his daily routine every day go R the sheep and but God wanted to get Moses's attention and when Moses was there he saw the bush burning he became desperate because he had never seen something of that kind the bush is burning and it's not consumed blessed be the name of the Lord maybe Moses was playing all doing something but when he saw the bush burning he became desperate that attracted his attention and God said now that's where I want you that's where I wanted you blessed be the name of the Lord and he came anxiously wanting to know what was going on then the voice spke from the pillar of fire and told him Moses remove your shoes amen for the place where you are standing is a holy ground praise be to God but remember somebody was praying in Egypt and God through prayer God answered that prayer blessed be the name of the Lord amen this man had ran from Egypt and was hiding he was like in Exile and his father was still praying because he knew that Moses was going to be the Liberator but at God's appointed time blessed be the name of the Lord even when Moses ran away the Israel they never stopped praying those who had caught the vision they kept on praying blessed be the name of the Lord am amen and God was doing something praise be to God am and until God met Moses and you see here when God spoke to uh uh when God spoke to say he said that he spoke to Moses he told him that I have heard the Cry of my children blessed be the name of the Lord that cry was prayer so God always answers prayer don't forget a family prayer that's why Jesus want to meet us blessed be the name of the Lord and here the prophet tells us in spiritual Amnesia no wonder the message spiritual Amnesia that you are not going to get anything from God until you get desperate about it how many things how many things have you asked from God and you have not gotten them and why are we desperate enough why are you not receiving the holy spirit is it because God is no longer giving no sir but are you desperate enough because if you are desperate you have to do something you will not just sit say for me my work is to go play drums and that's all do you think Rapture is going to take those drums do you think rapt is going to take the the the the what the mixer do you think this word is telling them mixer to get filled with the Holy Ghost you play it and don't be serious the Rapture will take place people will go you remain with your mixer brother so we better be desperate Amen in prayer prayer brings desperation the only we can be lifted up is through prayer amen instrument are not going to be raptured so obsessed with instrument until you forget that you have a soul that need to be raptured blessed be the name of the Lord play them amen when others are praying pray with them when others are singing sing with them you amen blessed be the name of the Lord praise be to God am amen so let us be desperate desperate person praise be to God because remember we are not wrestling against uh blood and flesh I was reading a quote where the Prophet says that the devil is the prince of the air the devil brings typhoon he brings tornado earthquake lightenings amen because he is the prince of the air praise be to God in the message Christ is revealed in his own word the prophet says remember Satan got a Punch coming at you don't care who are who you ah he is he's got a right for that one punch he's got somewhere he can punch you he's got a right to do that open place amen now that is the spot you have got to keep covered all the time when you're fighting with your opponent amen a good fighter will not box anywhere else because that is your weak spot now and the prophet says the devil just give you one punch he will always beat that angle so you have gotten to protect that side the devil knows Satan got a Punch coming at you and the only way you are going to guard yourself is on your knees amen the more you pray the more you defeat the Devil the Lesser you pray the more the devil will put you down every time you come you are putting on gods amen the element of Salvation the sword of the spirit how do you hold that sword okay show me your sword of the spirit are you going to slap the Devil with the Bible no you apply it in prayer it is written God is sa that is written whatever I bind I bind you I cast you I challenge you in prayer amen and whatever you are binding God is just squeezing you bind the devil God binds in prayer amen God answering that prayer you are making Hallelujah so Brethren the secret is in your prayer music is good we appreciate God musician you are doing a tremendous work but when it comes to prayer brother sister let me tell you be in prayer amen praise be to God that's why when you wake up to pray sometime because the devil knows that's where the secret is in the moment you pray amen God will answer any prayer you make any time anywhere anyhow amen there is no prayer that will go unanswered blessed be the name of the Lord amen it says in 1 Peter chapter 5: 8 be sober be vigilant because your anniversary the devil as a roaring lion WTH about seeking whom he may div do you know that sometime you worship and the devil is just there mocking at you he knows the devil knows what worship is he knows what real singing is he knows what real dancing is amen because when David danced to the lord the devil was in David's wife washing how can the whole King dance like that who was speaking in David's wife the devil but God was happy because the man was worshiping God he amen Worship the Lord with all that is within you with your strength with your might with all that is within you and when you're giving half worship the devil knows amen so let us know why we come here let us mean business with God I don't come here because I want to impress my wife or to please my pastor or to please brother so and so I come here to worship God Amen because we are meeting God as individuals do not even clap my hands how dare him that brother you better go out and sort yourself put your jokes outside come and mean business with God blessed be the name of the Lord the prophet say this is the Judgment seat of God and that's why he says in First Corinthians chapter 10 12 that wherefore let him that think standeth take heed L he fall in the message at Thy word Lord you should just keep going just keep on moving on don't get tired amen if you feel like a little SL just keep moving anyhow if you feel like not clapping just clap anyhow if you feel like not praying brother amen just move around amen just pray anyhow because God hears prayer God answers prayer amen the way you can intercede the way you can convince God you can do that in in prayer uhh you can deal with God In Prayer God you say it is written and that's why the Bible point us back when Daniel was praying he said God to us belongeth confusion of faces Daniel knew the language that God hears amen and indeed God answered his prayers blessed be the name of the Lord so when feel like the bible say that righteous man fall seven times and rise again but again if you find a righteous man is bragging about falling I fall and Rise there is something wrong there is something wrong somewhere because a Christian journey is a progressive Journey amen then in Ephesians 6:10 tells us that finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might amen Exodus Moses tells us and Moses said unto Joshua chose us out a Man Out men and go out fight with the amikit tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the road of God in my hand amen praise be to God and Bam says in the message the Lamb's Book of Life that one Soul saved you will see your name robed unto it as long as the Morning Star shall guil in so let save Souls Brethren each one of you you Housewives you don't have to be a preacher you do something for the glory of God remember Eternal things is what last forever amen amen and that is getting Soul saved let that be the first thing of all your work and all your ideas and all your motives amen there is your value it is that how much you got how much you desire it is how much you can do toward saving soul for Christ our money will fade praise be to God amen let us pray for those Souls like when we come here like this [Music] oh yeah no you can do much better than that amen because the answer is in prayer God answers prayer God hear prayer that's where the point is get somewhere nail there amen praise be to God you see God design prayer in the way that nobody you have to pray for yourself percent even wives when they want to when they have some when they want to get somewhere in the spirit they pray for themselves you will pray for her you pray with her but there are things that them themselves when they want you cannot say my God I pray for my wife Lord come and give her encounter right now the prophet tells us God hears desperate prayer my desperation may not even work on her God hears my prayer that is true but but she has to do something blessed be the name of the Lord you who are born in the message you think your dad's prayer will give you the Holy Ghost he will plead with God but remember the prophet tells us that a pardon is not a pardon until you accept your pardon so your father cannot accept for your pardon you have to pray of course it's is our day to pray for our children God save them God give them the Holy Ghost but the prophet tells us you cannot receive the Holy Ghost unless you know why he was given and how will you know you have to read yourself you have to see God yourself you said you promised it is written I need the Holy Ghost [Applause] amen blessed be the name of the Lord I'm just about to I'm look getting for where to finish from okay I just have to quotes in question and answers uh the prophet say that when Joshua entered the land of Canaan he said don't you let anyone of them live if it is a cute little baby a little am or Amorite kill it how many things in your life living has no problem little ands even you've never read even a page of the Bible ever since the year began you have never read one chapter even when you start reading the Bible you don't complete one verse and you saying that am we are passing time pass your time reading the word pass your time in prayer in fact he not even passing time in prayer but gaining in prayer you remember he will grow up the prophet says that little Amite will grow up to be an amerite he will pollute the camp it is growing little kill it in prayer because it is growing it's little but it's growing and it will pollute the camp look cute look innocent it looks like it's all right but don't you have anything to do with it you stay away from it CN but the prophet says put it out your calendar is Israelite let me say this my friends you better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you bring back the oldfashioned prayer meetings the real Godly repentance the all night altar service oh live de alone leave the world alone that thing that was you off into a little thing that you shouldn't amen if you don't destroy that enemy he will destroy you blessed be the name of the Lord amen you see the devil is so cunning if you look at that scripture shall we stand on our feet uh the way that did it I wonder whether Samson let me tell you destroy that enemy before your enemy destroys you let us learn to talk to God when we okay amen precious father in the name of Jesus we thank you for this uh evening indeed Lord we have we thank you for the word you have sent us and we have come here to
