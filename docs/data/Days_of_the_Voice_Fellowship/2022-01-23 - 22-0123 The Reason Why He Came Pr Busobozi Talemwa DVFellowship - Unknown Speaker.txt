you know what is sin is any belief [Music] gene of god in you right when he went sugary some of you who don't understand what i'm talking about i want you to look at it this way that each of you is the same gene of your father you you know elise was doing certain things and then i was telling her to get out of here and then he laughed a second and then i said why'd you laugh at that but she behaves like you know you cannot do it like somebody else [Music] there is a gene in you while you win secret movie that's what only constrains you to behave like your origin somebody else you cannot do like somebody else and then you want to behave like father wonder you're gonna win single granddaddy you want to dress like you oh yeah you want to walk like but you realize his [Applause] it may take [Applause] [Music] you may even realize your own father may be ever a certain way and then he said everyone is no children different from you but yours is also down from the genes [Applause] you
