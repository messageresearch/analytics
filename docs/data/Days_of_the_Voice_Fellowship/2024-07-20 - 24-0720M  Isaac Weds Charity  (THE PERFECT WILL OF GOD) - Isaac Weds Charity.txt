come to pass what the dearly beloved we are here together again in the sight of God the presence of this witnesses to join together and is ofmy according to thein of custom of the Christian Church tol on their behalf the blessings of God Psalms 1271 says except the Lord build the house in marriage is Honorable and a holy estate instituted by God In The Garden of Aiden it was there that the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone Eve was then fashioned from a reib of Adam given um to him for a wife and it was th recorded shall a man leave his father and his motherto his wife and they shall be one it is sanctioned and honed by the presence of Jesus Christ at the marriage in of gilee between Christ and his church God ordained ordains it at the foundation ra rather as a foundation and bond of family life for the mut and comfort of husband and wife and for the welfare of the state so there marriage is not to be entered into by any unadvisable [Music] but and I believe that these are R also in the fear of into this Hol estate these two persons now Des to entered together as one there before we proceed If any man here or woman can show any cause why they may not L be joined together him now declare it or else forever hold your Fe before God and the sear of All Hearts if either of you know of any impend why you may not Beed in marriage you do not for Beed that you

together otherwise than God's word that all are noted by the Lord neither is their marri blessed [Music] by we would like to go into the script and preach to you for a few minutes I usually give that PR that introduction I would like us at this moment to First ourselves and pray Our Father The Giver of Life the author of all good things the author and the finisher the creator of Our Lives we are here today to Wi the marriage of Charity and Isaac we here because you insed this insti as we have seen in the scripture in the Book of Genesis would like to have you as the chief guest today and may

the two but Lord those who are here those who are online this the be spoken it imp their Liv Commit This ceremony to your hand sharing of your word amen amen you may be seated please we just wait for the bride to see amen amen praise the name of the Lord before we go into the word I'd like to appreciate Pastor Mak his wife also here the rest of the family the brother who you've already had brother

for them thank you for coming and her she did not stand praise the name of certain blessed is I'd like I'd like to appreciate them for receiving us we we had a good reception there we started eating as soon as we arrived and uh then after that we they took us in the house and fed us almost to the point of death really we so grateful on behalf of the family of Isaac and ministry here we would like to appreciate amen and so today the big day has finally come and uh please do not um think [Music] people this is one of the reasons I'm I'm saying this you see he's not interpreting this word properly yet is the best interpreter that I have we from since Thursday we we Tred we TR the long journey to and came back here almost did not sleep for for some time now we've been trying to do Renovations in the church we did not have the ground like this so as a church we already had this program before the programs of the wedding we've had people like Brother Martin who is even obviously not here because he's not rested for the whole week I've had young people here the whole night of areans last night the whole night cleaning up you know you know how do they call you know you know trying to clean up the dust the and make the placeit so many of them including myself have not had good sleep for a few days but nonetheless we are here this morning good and we are here to end this started amen and so relax that actually for that reason even people have been L I want everybody to relax tell your neighbor relax yeah you did well tell her to relax so everybody relax just a few moments in the word of God after which we shall do the um the uh the vows and then go to the reception for those of who are registered to go amen so I'd like you to give me your undivided attention this morning because God laid this burden on my heart as I was at the introduction ceremony what I will be able to share on today before I even start because what I'm going to preach on today is unlike what I usually do had many Weddings But I'm taking a different direction today charity and Isaac not only for you because we've had sessions with them told them a lot today it's not usually only for them are here are onl mostly the thought God laid on my heart is for the young people so just pray for me I'm going to speak to you this morning on the perfect will of God and we going to read Romans 12 says iech you there by thees of God present your bodies a Living Sacrifice acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world ye transformed by the renewing of your mind may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God speaking on that perfect will of God we have two Wills of God we have the perfect will of God and the permissive will of God you know we've seen many examples from the scripture but the typical one that we all know is that of a man called um the uh the prophet uh I'm just trying to recall his name prophet balam and so Prophet balam was a man that was so intoxicated in his heart Wasing something he wanted to accomplish it regardless of what when that was cing Israel because he was promised by the king Bal that if you go and cast for me these people I'm going to make you great I'm going to give you I'm going to make youe go and so the man prophet balam he he said I'll go C but before I do I'll inquire from God he went before God God told him you cannot do it these people are blessed they cannot be I want to tell you whoever God has blessed cannot be C and and so we are the people of God the C of the world can come but the man said I will go back again to God was promised more wealth more power and so then when he went back okay you can go does God change his mind conning his word God is God God is not a man his first thought is perfect idea is as perfect as his idea never change his mind concerning anything he said in his word and so because of the desire of his heart he insisted and persisted going to C told him you can go and so he went now many of you know the story even when he arrived there you know he could not cast them as he was going on a donkey you know the donkey saw Angel of the Lord before him and and the donkey stopped but the man would not stop he instead struck the and he said what's wrong come on let's go and the donkey spoke and say to have I ever disobeyed you my man and said anyway let's go can you imagine he was so blind that you could not see that donkeys are not supposed to speak because he had his own will was helping to accomplishing his will will him go it was not God's way it was God's permissive because the perfect will of God is what he said the first time and what he says the first time what we have in the Bible word godf the will of God but because he wasant on he still had to you know pass go through everything himself before the children open his mou to instead blessed hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of my God you cannot be cast Isaac canot be C charity to bless you today blessing amen and if you were here also you were a part of the blessing now this man Bal still went by force but he couldn't C but what he went with was the permissive will of God and God let him go so I'm going to speak to you on this thought and I'll divide it into two points what is the perfect will of God concerning a woman and a man rather a woman and man relationship how are we supposed to relate with with women if you are man if you're a man and how are we supposed to relate with men if you were a woman what is the perfect will of God in that issue the second question I will talk about is what is the outcome of godive after that we will go to the V and I'm going to stick with my usually to avoid preaching for long I usually have notes charity I give you this booklet afterwards because thoughts that I studed and waited upon the Lord over and I believe it's the word of God concerning this ceremony so for the most part I'll be reading and speaking by inspiration where necessary so we'll go with the first question what is the perfect will of God concerning a woman and a woman and man relationship now theil in the world today has turned a woman and these words are really coming from my heart and from the inspiration of the spirit every young man that is here today is not married please pay attention and also the married on theil in the world has turned a woman into a sex [Music] object that is why they dress to be sexy Believers should never dress to be sex and I'm so happy all the maidens look at how they come yes show how they address what we I want you to show the bride God bless you you can be seated Brides this in this generation dressed to be sexy you imagine someone saying that it is their wedding day and they dress with all the boobs out and the bo like going to run away don't believe that that is a perverted generation we don't dress to be sex we dress to be virtu so that is why they dress to be sexy because the woman is turned into a sex object attract men to follow them you want they want to dress in such a way that when they go on the streets that every man will turn their head a spirit of the generation Spirit of perversion it's a wrong spirit and all the Believers young people must turn away their heads from such Spirit the movie industry has turned into woman they have turned a woman into anything you find you know what Hollywood has done to a woman you know they've turned her into a lasting object and even it has come down into our society because of Television because of the op because of the movies you know whatever you want to call it and young ladies watch this things young men watch things and it has come down into our society where she the woman has been reduced to an object of L and desire this from the intention of God when he created the woman Satan the per of all good things is the one who has done but God by his grace still has his daughter who will escape the TR I hear the daughters of God shouting in First Corinthians 7 ver now concerning things whereof you wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife is this the will of God is this the word of God this is why we are here and let every woman have her own husb it is the will of God let the husband Render unto the wife du benevolence likewise also the wife the wife has no power over her own body from today you don't have power over but your husband does and likewise also has no power over his own but the wife this is the will of God concerning man and woman relation woman is created with virtues God she should never def Society has forgotten about it church has forgotten Christians have forgotten still those not forgotten virtue for a girl to be a virgin woman some comes and and maybe some of you are here and they slap you that is your sacred virtue of Womanhood you should never let any man do that you sister why because you are that body is supposed to be a virtuous why because it is the Temple of the Holy Ghost this is what separates us from all the denominations because we are Holiness motherhood another virtue for her to be able to be a wife to a husband to be a homekeeper to take care of our children children not just be one who is hoping that's why girls in our generation no longer want this when you do this they and they think you you are a loser they think that you're no longer going to have fun even they ask younger men you mared are you sure you tired of singlehood what is in it about being single to be single is to be lonely to be single is to fight and struggle with desire but yet God has a perfect has a perfect a relationship between a man and a woman say is better for a man not even to touch a woman brother if you're not married tou any you finder men touching the girls and they begin to feel warm they feel good and they leave their after all she's my friend and they said they're not talking but they just feeling good those are not your benefits until you are married it is good that a man does not even tou a woman good you're not saying amen do you believe a man doesn't do that said let every man have his own wife it is the will of God and when now you have your wife the wife's body is yours your HB is your you cannot kick him even when he says go back to I'm tired of you you run and go to his tell him that's where I because you fashioned out the two become one from this day no more two people you have lost your body from today you have power over for and has a every man have his own wife woman have her own husband notes HB one become one so no girlfriends here no here nothing like that that is not thef Paul gave this instruction because he understood that the perfect will of God concerning this relationship of a man and a woman in the beginning God created a man and a woman for him for mut andow created charity mfort and fellow she's from today she's your comfort how can you begin talking about the problems and the struggles with another girl another woman let me me you don't know what I'm going through even my wife I don't share with her there is a problem with you are not supposed to find Comfort woman is not your wife you are not supposed to find comfort that is not your hus God has created a man and a woman for mutual comfort number two for procreation if you don't want to have children don't get married simp that we are still getting to know each other that is supposed to be C you can know each other for however long you without meeting as husband and wife but the moment you get married the one of the purposes of marriage for procreation to have children the B says the fruit of the womb Mak has been rewarded by by giving him a beautiful daughter has rewarded you and also I will also say this I know we mixed congregation purp of marriage sexual [Applause] graic and I said that because it rhymes with what I'm talking about today we usually speak this in private these things things attained which Mt andow procreation sexual gratification find a word and throw it there already things attained other word it be outside of his it will have consequen we will later Exodus 2014 Thou shalt not commit aulter now that's the Old Testament but in Matthew 5 27 he says you have heard that it was said by them of all time that thou sh but this is Jesus now whoever look on a woman to last after her has committed a doubt with already in his heart so now you can now see the law of Christ is even magnified greater than the law of Moses even need to do the simp then no you start can I have your contact but in your head in your mind you don't have any intentional marriage that is the permissive will world people do that hallelujah hallelujah all you young people hearing me today this is the way of God what you seeing here it is the way of God and you people in the message told you many times if a young man comes to you and seeks for friendship not willing to come to your father to come to your mother come to your pastor that one is yes the wol they will break your heart into pieces and then you will begin crying and bleeding and blaming everybody you want to blame but the one to blame is yourself following due process when this young man wanted to marry he came to me and told me Pastor I said what makes you think finally I made up my mind the woman I want to marry said are you sure he said yes I said who is it he said charity I said charity I already knew her her sister comes to our church here I said are you sure said I'm sure I said okay if you are serious come to me I want you to tell those words to her father he said said are you ready I'm ready that is the serious man who wants to be in the perfect hallelujah hallelujah now but you find this young mening around breaking girl hearts and the girls are willing and ready to and they begin beding they don't need to go there perfect will of God is already here in his word as a pastor I don't say these things lightly some of my people some of our young people have been affected by this and so when we get an opportunity like this we want to say it and say it loud and whoever looks on a woman to after has already Comm but how can he look at a woman if she's dressed mod if she has Spirit of Christ it is how they present themselves s you are dressing a on the knee when you sit all your virtues are out the ofel is we need to break those demons and spirits out of our young people and by teaching them the word and then a man looks at that and his heart begins to breath I want to talk to both of you have already now the scure says in Galatians 519 now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication unlean and he says um and such like of the which I tell you before as I have also told you in the time P now listen to this and why is important for me to talk about this they that which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God now the scripture says that for that for what if some did not believe what if some did not believe yes shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect true every man alive tell your neighbor let God be true amen so the things of God the words of God is true God says the adter and the fornicators the UN the the murderers the EnV the drunk the drunk those shall not inher it I believe this is the way that God has placed for a man and a woman to live the perfect will of God any other way when God makes his will unnown through his word that is forever settled in heaven can never be changed un belief cannot hinder God others who will not believe don't they have words that people have them one night stand they have one night stand uh they have other words I don't all those things said that do such not in so if others don't believe it we believe it we believe it we believe it hallelujah hallelujah and we are here to prove to the devil that there is a generation that is going to stand for others want they will not hinder God unbelief will never if 100 do not believe the one will believe will Rapture the one 100 are you one of them when God makes his will known word forever belief cannot will always be those like charity those like that will decide to follow through and do God's perfect way in their relationship for God say marriage is and bed you sleep someone you never Mar it is Def God looks at it as an Abomination and you need to repent because if you don't you will not inherit the Kingdom you may even be married you are here you sleep on undefiled bed you need to repent while you still have the but and will Jud now in God words himself this Mar we amen everybody tell them it is this is the most important relationship you will ever be a part of of course except salvation you have other important relations like parents you have friends siblings relives this like this new one now can fail actually all relationship even this one many have married and failed this marriage Mar relation the most crucial one a man a woman will be always hold it as such always hold it as such are you listening to me always hold this relationship everybody else is less when it comes to this father the moment you accepted what he has done you were under his headship transfer over to another so this is the most important relationship treat everybody else second to this relationship this is the only way you can sustain a marriage but when you bring in relativ you find women today when they see uh uh pastors and then their husbands can I have know if she brings it all right your pastor is not more important than your husband that is what we believe we believe in honoring men of God honing parents we also believe according to what our Prophet told us the second relationship is marriage the first being you your even when you have your children oh you're going to have children I see sisters have children so your family is fruitful I don't doubt that you'll be fruitful in Isaac's life even when you have children they are not more important than your husband even you some men they take children even bu secret properties even their don't know because this is my blood oh your wife is your yourself not even your BL but your praise the name of the Lord I am sorry I hope I'm not offending some coming down can we say Amen we believe that to be true so many people have had many vows made vows while these you will make it is just an obligation those vows are just an obligation yes have to fulf the Real Marriage goes beyond those vow it reflects God perfect and your submission to that will and I'll just briefly go to the last question and then we what is the outcome of God's permissive will now Prophet let me try to stick with the not Prophet bam is one example of those that have walked in God's permissive way the permissive will of God is exciting it is it promises great things and appeals to the flesh but painful sorrowful and many Christians have walked in fornication in in un cleaniness but this is not God's perfect will Bel a child of God waiting for the coming of will work in the perfect for the scripture says in Romans 61 what shall we say shall we continue in sin May abound God forbid how shall we de to sin live any longer there God might let you live and actually not take your life when you live in his come and like not means okay even they not discover me you married and then go out you go in and then you come back wife I'm fine it is like that man when God told him everything and he killed some he left some and he came back and the told him did you kill [Music] everything he said yes I killed everything hallelujah hallelujah he said wait I'm sure those animals were very F but the man of God in the real of the he had everything let me tell you God sees everything God hears everything our God is not blind our God is not not Dum he hears and he sees and he anoints to preach to you been doing theast doesn't know a is God who loves you our God has a lot of long suffering our God is not a dictator want to take anyone to H everybody he has long suffering so that you may change work in his we continue in sin may God forid how can we I pray that this will convict some young people praise the name of the Lord well if you are loving me and now you're beginning to ha me don't you worry I'm just being obedi to God told me to speak about praise the name of the Lord God might let you leave and actually not take your life he shares his with no man and he would actually let consequences follow a man or a woman that would take sometimes listen listen sometimes long lifelong consequences you have seen things that actually follow Generations because someone in the past not break the C if your grandfather was a liar and he didn't break that and your father is a liar he couldn't break the now you become alive and if you don't break the will become I wish I had time to if your father was a very if your great grandfather was a very moral your grandfather becomes becomes you don't break we see those things in we see those things in churches we especially in lineages that's why people say is foll but the Bible says we are now a new creation we are supposed to break some cyes things that we were born sometimes in families following us some of you are born in poor you can break that c some of you are born in imortal break that because the continuation of that in your life and you can actually determine your future the future of your children God blessed Abraham never blessed Abraham I bless you bless children bless children children children that is how God does when he blesses a Lage it go through another Hallelujah am if you are here today amen God is blessing if you make a decision break a ccle hallelujah amen hallelujah amen I am here and I'll tell you I'm not an angel I'm a human being and I am born from a family where my father was a priest before he became a PRI he was po man a polygam man brother and when the light of the world came toal my father you know according to their Revival that time how they she had to give up all the women with one that he loved most well we know we don't do it that way now reation that's how they believe my fathered all the remain with only my mother I was not born at the time I got born afterwards I was the fourth out of my mother but even after that he he gave birth to two more after me after that he back again and went again to polygamy he has several women many children from this mother guess what guess what my brothers did the sameed by don't do they only do pogam that's the demon in my in my for but when I reive this m I said to myself I am breaking this C I am not going to be a part of that lineage I have another L coming down from Christ I will not be a to marry one woman shower her with all the have as many children as I God has been faithful because he saw my decision he gave me the desire of my heart has given me five beautiful children and if he want more he will give us am I Hol no decision I made make a celu is andity you can make the same I didn't never got a chance to see your father ISAC like any and every things that travel in Blood and they follow that tell you if you Embrace what I'm speaking to gives you a new decision comes by say I am deciding on this first day beginning a new if my father was a witch I am not going to be a wi if my father was a going to do it if he was SM I am starting a new generation and the B says you are a royal priesthood you are a new generation You Are Holy people we are here today the power of this message to declare Our Generation God can ra bring a new of the who will be the cycle breaker the permissive will of God will bring about many bad things it will bring illegitimate children like is how have been menace to the world what is happening in Gaza because of is abah going to Theiss [Applause] your Abraham was supposed to believe but what he came before God after his wife I have a child by on my this will be the prom that was F that was not God word went said I to have known better to I believe God sh his he knows what I do what your wife told you to do that was God and it brought forth is who has been a minister to the world and that's how has been all these Arab and everything by it will also cause abortion Theiss God you find young ladies you after a few months oh you can take this as a prophecy if you you will have a baby in your but I have good news for you because this is God's be on you are in it brings the it brings Mur Hearts an unfulfilled life that has a big void in many cases where people have gone as far as trying to change their genda tried even medically being deceived by the devil the scripture would go on to say in Romans because that when they knew God let us glorify God as God God is God don't worry in a few moments I'm finishing the last scure you see neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish after that profess to be wise they became and then they Chang the glory of the uncorruptible god likeup with anding things where God also gave them up to un are people on Earth has given through the L of their own heart to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who change the truth of God into and they worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed for and amena them AFF for even their women they did change the natural use into that which is against you find they called lesbian tell a woman to get married don't tell me she's very busy moving around calling others [Applause] fellows Our Generation is in a lot of trouble you find they don't want to get married but they bur you find that conversation so the words they to tell men is here for even women change the natural into that against and likewise also the men living the natural useal they B in their one another with working that which is UN and the says and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was made and even as they did not like retain in their knowledge how many want to retain Goden renew your mind preaching of the true you like the word the word comes in your no is not the men with men all right God gave them over to reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being fill all un with fornication with wickedness Whisperers backbiters haters of God despiteful proud disobedient to parents disob to without understanding Breakers I don't don't care who knowing the Judgment of God such of death not only do the same but have pleasure however the perfect will of God always bring joy always bring it
