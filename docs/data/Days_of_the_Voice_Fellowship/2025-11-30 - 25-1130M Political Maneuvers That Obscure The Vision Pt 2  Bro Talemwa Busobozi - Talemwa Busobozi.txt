You've been in many places, done a lot [music] of things, had a lot of responsibilities, [music] family, work, and many things. [singing] And maybe some of you have unanswered questions. But I want you to come to this moment. If each of us could be sensitive enough to know we in the presence of the king, I would like you and me and all of us to forget everything. [music] And if you would have this desire in your heart and say, "Lord, you say it in your word, having done all stand. I'm here standing in your presence and I desire Lord that you will bring the word of life to me [music] and that you will heal my heart &gt;&gt; and you would energize me. You would heal me. You would speak to me. Don't listen to your body if you're tired. Close your mind from that. Close your mind from your problem. And I just pray that even as I speak these words, you're just beginning to ascend in the spirit. [music] In your in prayer, just begin to speak to him. We are we are worshiping him this morning. One word for for he for you is enough from him. [music] But you would have to first be in the spirit that would receive from him. If you are in the flesh, you cannot receive from him.

Ask Ask. The Bible says, "Ask and shall receive." No matter where you are seated, way in the back, just ask him. What is your need this morning? What is your need this morning? Don't wait until the preaching. I don't even know what to say, [music] but but but he knows what you need. But I ask him and he shall receive. So Lord, will you put in words in my mouth, words that I didn't even have in my mind that I will be able to speak them this morning according to the needs of your children. Lord, we commit this service into your hands. We ask that you come and have your way [music] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you saints. &gt;&gt; I'd like to greet and each and every one of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ this morning. Would you please turn to your neighbor and tell them God bless you brother. God bless your sister. Nice to see you in the house of the Lord this morning. Amen. Amen. Amen. It's a wonderful thing to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are going to go to the scriptures right away this morning. And we are reading in the book of Joshua chapter 5. If you are there, just say amen. And I am requesting those who don't have Bibles to please uh buy a Bible. I was actually thinking about it the other day that uh you know everyone should have a Bible. Every Christian should carry a Bible. Don't get a just a pocket size. Get one as big as you can. that you can you can carry and scare some demons around. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are reading out of the book of Joshua chapter 5 vers 1 to 7. from Samville. &gt;&gt; And it came to pass when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were on the side on the sea, which were by the sea, heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of Jordan from Just wanted to make sure that I was reading the right place. um where by the sea heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel until we were passed over that their heart melted. Neither was their was their spirit in them anymore because of the children of Israel. We will take verse by verse by verse brother. At that time the Lord said, "Uh, can I have more sound, brother?" Thank you. And Joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of Israel at the heel of the four skins. And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise. Look at that word cause, vision, purpose. &gt;&gt; And this is the cause. Why Joshua did circumcise? &gt;&gt; All the people that came out of Egypt that were males, even all the men of war died in the in died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt. Now all the people that came out were circumcised. But all the people that were born in the wilderness, by the way, as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised. For the children of Israel walked 40 years in the wilderness, still all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord, unto whom the Lord swear that he would not show them the land which the Lord swore unto their fathers that he would give us a land that flowth with milk and honey. So you see saying sin has a penalty and sin is disobedience of the word. There's a penalty to it. And the Bible says to him, you may ask me, what is sin? In James, it says, to him that knoweth to do good and does not do it and doesn't do it, to him it is sin, and sin has a penalty. vers um 8 &gt;&gt; 7. And their children whom he raised up in theirstead, them Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way. Amen. You may be seated. Brothers and sisters, uh yesterday we were at um the introduction ceremony, brother Enoch. Uh is he here this morning? Ah, right over here. Stand up so people can see something. Yeah. Uh, brother Enoch was introduced in his in the wife of in the family of his wife yesterday. Wife to be. &gt;&gt; Oh, she she she's I thought she's here, but I think she's not here right now. So, uh, we just want to say congratulations to you, brother Eno. Everything went very well. when we went in the room there to talk matter of fact pastor Robert was also there the parents and um you know some elders and I didn't tell you we had a very spiritual uh discussion in there was like actually a prayer meeting God really gave us grace and uh you know I had also had some time to have some fellowship with the with the father with the father of the sister and on this note I want to say this I have realized because I've been on several weddings both here in another place but I can tell you uh if you start wrong you usually end wrong and the process is not always pleasant. But if you start right then the process will be pleasant and the end will be good because you see one thing that you know that as pastors we do not make decisions for anyone. I've told in my life in my life as a minister I think I've uh the closest I came to advise someone against marrying somebody was two times and uh but each of those times you can see well they insisted and got married but still their marriage has been bumped. all day. And what I'm saying is really connected to what we were sharing on Sunday and I'm going to be continuing with it also today. You know how to give honor and respect the man of the hour that God has raised for you. You see, brother Bam says if you cannot respect the the man you at least respect the office the man holds in God. Because you see, if God is going to speak to you and he has chosen a man, you will only go through that man in that season. So if you bypass, God has provided way for that time, for that season for you. then you are opening up yourself for heartbreaks and pain and suffering. You know, I've I've seen people, you know, who would rather get counsel and advice from their elder brothers or elder elderly people in the in the communities than getting counsel from their pastor because they think it's about age. This is not about age. your life and God's purpose for your life. He has entrusted a pastor if you have one, which you should, and a husband, if you have one, and a father. These are three people that God has placed in your life. Each of us, each of us, we have one of those. And for you sisters who are not yet married, you you have to. And those people are usually very very important for you to dis um you know ignore their counsel in your life. When you are considering to make important decisions like marriage is one of them. you should always seek for that counsel. So, and I and I say that because, you know, I've noticed that whenever a young man is getting to, you know, wanting to start getting into a relationship with somebody. Some have thought they should go start it and only come to the pastor when they are 100% sure. because they don't want to get ashamed. What if I go and I tell him and then it doesn't work out? I will be ashamed. No, that's not the approach. The approach is you go to the pastor because you are not sure. You need counsel, you need prayer, you need leadership. Praise the Lord. And I've had a few that have come to me several times, you know, start a relationship and uh, you know, along the way in the middle things don't work out. But you see, because they were already in touch with me and I wasn't really making any decisions for them, but the relationship, you know, what to do, what, you know, things talk about along the way they realize they it just can't work out. So what what they usually do then you also have to now guide them how to break up as Christians as believers without a heartbreak. I have people in this church that have broken up before like broken up before broken up a relationship. But you know they can still live and love each other genuinely because the relationship was guided. But if you go behind the leadership and then you want to do everything on your own, they will break your heart. they will squeeze it and then you you you now come back when you are hurt and these are the kind whereby you be like I don't even want to ever see that person IN MY LIFE EVER again and then you wonder are they going to the same heaven praise the Lord so when you think you've seen someone brother come to the right office let's Talk it over. Let's pray about it and be guided. And sister, if you think you've seen somebody, uh, just go to prayer and wait upon the Lord because you're not supposed to be seen. um you know these days actually I've seen women also proposing to men you know but Jesus said he did not he he did not choose us we did not choose him rather he chose us praise the lord he chose us &gt;&gt; you believe that saints he chose us so even in marriage the man chooses the woman and the woman accepts the choice. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Can we do that later, brother? And and how many believe that it's a man that chooses and the woman accepts the choice, turns down the choice. So, she also has a choice to make. And no one can make a choice for anybody. No one can make a choice for you. No one should make a choice for you. Some people are very highly enthusiastic and they would like to you know do a lot of commendations. Oh sister, brothers to begin with I think that is wrong because if it if they get married and the things don't work out they will blame you but if it happens just still always ensure to make your own decision anyway. So in the process of all that so I was just saying brother but you know you know introduced me to u the the you know we had a lot of meetings of course with the the sister and him and then also met the father of the sister and uh we had very fruitful conversation as well as the father the past of the of the gun and um you know uh that that is very good. So the wedding is on 31st January, right? January. So that is after our youth camp. So I think it will be the first wedding next year. If no one does their wedding before because we have about three or four couples in the in the pipeline. Brother Julius and and and um is not here this morning and Sister Faith because he only has a Sunday off. He only at his work has Sunday off only. So um is the and it's the only time he had and he wanted to you know go see the parents on his side uh together with the sisters well you know so we just remember them in prayers that God will give them grace but they told me that they'll stream the service. Uh I'm happy to see brother Joseph and his wife, Sister Mariam. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you're no longer a spouse to each other. You're now married to each other. Someone yesterday was telling me, "When are they coming off off of the moon?" Well, they're finally here. And church, let me see how you do it at DVF. I'd like you to officially welcome Sister Mariam to DVF. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We welcome you, sister. And uh you know, most of the people here are young like you. I know you already have some friends here. It's not only your husband. So, I'm sure you'll have a a wonderful fellowship with us. It's a journey, friends. It's a journey. We are in a journey, a long journey on this earth. If God gives you people that you can walk with, just love and cherish them. Everyone has failures. Every one of us has weakness. But you see, if you can be able to overlook the person's weakness, and love them genuine. That's what sweet fellowship is. &gt;&gt; You know, if I I looking around, if you know, we were I was just picking on everyone's weaknesses and then you pick also on mine, none of us can be here, you know. But but if we can love each other, the Bible says love covers a multitude of sins. So which means that if you love you will also tolerate others. So let us learn to tolerate each other love each other regardless because the love of God doesn't have conditions. The love of God is um is a free. It is um um you know you don't have to do someone doesn't have to do anything to qualify. You just love them. Turn to your neighbor. Tell them I love you. Amen. Don't even worry even if it is a sister with the love of God. Maybe if it's a sister, you can add I love you with the love of God. Because they may come to my office and and tell tell me that brother so and so actually told me he loved me and then now he's engaging to another sister. Praise the Lord. So I know people who were at the wedding yesterday, traditional wedding yesterday are tired and had a few hours to sleep and others have not even come to church this morning. I see those who have come. Please, God bless you and don't listen to your body. Focus on the spirit this morning. Sister Esther lost somebody and I think a cousin and so if you can reach out to her and um you know um uh give her some condolence message. This morning she asked me to give a contact from um of another place where she had traveled because she needed to pick a child from the from the uh from the school. I directed her to to the church there. I was just checking. I don't remember the name of the place, but uh she I know she's with us in the spirit. Are you ready for the word this morning? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was just looking here. I know you are used to sitting with your wife, brother uh Brian. And I don't know what happened. You know when I see couples you see you see like Joseph seated with his wife. When you see a couple seated like that you you feel good and then afterwards they begin to separate. So Joseph never change that unless if you are ministering. I'm just looking around to see others. You see, you find at FIRST WHEN THEY STARTING, THEY want to prove everybody will love each other and then afterwards, you know, they they they begin to separate. One sits here and another one there. Couples, always sit together. Let me encourage that. It's a beautiful thing. Is it not church? Amen. Amen. The couples did not say amen. I know I may forget this. I know we have already read the scripture. But let me also read this before we get into the weddings, marriages, weddings, marriages. This is a season that the church is going through. So this is an introduction uh invitation. Um, I'm not going to read all the details, but I'm simply going to say this is what brother Emmanuel told us on on um on Sunday, last Sunday. So, brother Emanuel and Sister Ruth inviting the entire DVF family because their parents are inviting us, but we know them. So, that's why I'm um to this ceremony scheduled on 13th December in Toro. So you must love them to go and we all love them don't we? So uh I know on the same date sister Martha is having a function for his daughter for her daughter which is here in Kala. For those who don't who will not manage this one at least you should come to the one of sister because we shall have on each uh ceremonies we're going to be given a slot to minister the word. Um um let me ask brother Emanuel and sister Ruth to stand up so those of you who don't know them can see them brother God bless you Ruth God bless you so amen so that is 13th December it's a busy season uh how many were blessed by the service on Sunday now if you missed it like the ones who were on the moon and others who were not here, please go back and listen. I really encourage you to go back and listen um this morning uh maybe for a while. I'm going to just uh go to the part two of that. Political maneuvers that obscure the vision. M &gt;&gt; this is a subject I didn't never when I I was done on Sunday I never thought I was going to go to part two but after the service one brother you know brother Andrew Glover Andrew Glover interestingly sent me a quote &gt;&gt; which I will actually read for you today that was exactly in the line of what I was talking about on Sunday and that gave me an inspiration to you know continue on that thought. So I just want us to stay uh you know put you know stay in your place. If you feel you are about to go out in 30 minutes, you better go now and then you come back and stay seated all through. I remember when I first you know came into the message I was enjoying everything and I never from that time I never go out when the preacher is still preaching. When the preacher is still preaching I I don't even want to go because I I know I will miss something even if I go I go maybe when he has just finished and I run and I come back that's the that's the atmosphere we should put in the church for the for the Holy Spirit if the Holy Spirit sees that you are honoring him then he will always come amen And I'm happy to see brother Omoding from Kamoja here. God bless you brother and all those visiting with us this morning. The Lord bless you. Also I have Kagaba here come for the function of brother you know and uh we are just happy to you know be with all of you this morning. Amen. Amen. um political maneuvers that obscure the vision. Now we have to we read on we read in Exodus on Sunday. But this morning we have read from Joshua. And you notice that the ministry of Joshua comes after the ministry of Moses. &gt;&gt; And on Sunday we talked about the vision. And you know we we're talking about the vision uh of God for the generation but also for a place also for a season. And then we talked about the mission and how for that vision to be carried out. God always raises a man not men a man. and he anoints that man with the anointing needed to fulfill or carry out or bring about that vision. And so then we talked about the different political maneuvers that have happened usually happen within the congregation, within the group, within that same time. And you know when they try to do those maneuvers, it it obscures that vision that God has, you know, like not really hinder but obscure it or rather try to uh make the people not see it clearly and often times it is delayed you know uh to obscure means something that is unclear, something that is uncertain. So the vision of God is certain. Let me put it this way. Bring it to your address now. The vision of God for your life is Satan. It is certain. It is certain. uh it has to be accomplished and God knows it and he knew it before he even called it and also the vision of God for a generation for a season is not unsure is not uncertain. It is certain but you see these political MANEUVERS WILL NOT always be carried out by one man. God calls one man. But you know the devil will send many men. And these men will be politically motivated to move against the one man that God has raised FOR THE EARTH. AND OFTEN times we see that when they try to do their political maneuvers the vision which was previously SATAN becomes obscured. You know people begin to be unclear and uncertain the direction they are going. People begin to doubt. People begin to question. PEOPLE begin to murmur. Confusion comes in the camp. And I want to tell you this morning, anything that brings uncertaintity, anything that brings confusion, anything that brings question, doubting, QUESTION, anything that brings doubt, it is NOT OF GOD. BECAUSE THE DEVIL USUALLY DOES THAT. He always sws a seed of discrepancy. He always ss a seed of doubt. You know when he came to Eve? HE ASKED HER DID GOD say did GOD SAY NOW THAT WAS A QUESTION. BUT HERE HOW THE DEVIL BROUGHT THE QUESTION. DID GOD SAY THAT YOU SHALL NOT eat of any fruit in the g of on any tree in the garden? Let me ask you a question. DID THE DEVIL KNOW WHAT God said? Answer me. Did the devil know what God said? But when he came, HE CHANGED IT. HE ASKED A question which was not meant which was meant to present the devil as a believer but TO MAKE EVE DOUBT THE WORD did God say so he knew the devil that God had said that we should not eat that you shall not eat of any of any tree in the garden. HE KNEW THERE WERE TREES IN THE GARDEN, BUT THERE WAS A TREE THAT were was not supposed TO BE EATEN OF. And God had not said to them that you shall not eat of any tree. God had told them, "Eat of ALL TREES, BUT OF THIS ONE, DON'T EAT IT." SO NOW WHEN THE DEVIL CAME, HE DID NOT say that God said that God that God said don't eat of any tree. He didn't give A STATEMENT. HE DIDN'T GIVE an opinion. Are you HEARING ME CHURCH? OH BROTHERS AND SISTERS, this this thought, this revelation, inspiration that God gave me, I'm sure it will help us as a church, as a body of believers to really come a step higher, you know, so that we can mature in the knowledge of the word. Because if you know, if you know the vision, then you are you are halfway there. But if the vision is unclear, if you don't know where you are going, you don't know how long you're going to walk. You know, you you you may fail to make it. Many times when I'm driving a long journey, my children ask me, "DADDY, HOW FAR? DADDY, HOW FAR?" They'll ask me within every two minutes or one minute. How far? How far? Until I get tired. I'm like, don't worry. We will get there soon. HOW SOON? HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE? WHY? Because they do not they don't have access to Google maps. So they can't see the VISION of where they are going. They don't know the vision. So the vision to THEM IS OBSCURED. AND SO THEY'RE FILLED WITH CONFUSION. THEY'RE FILLED WITH ANXIETY. THEY'RE FILLED WITH QUESTIONS, WITH DOUBTS. AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. SO THEY KEEP ASKING EVERYBODY. IF THEY ASK me and I'm quiet, they will ask their mom. If their mom is quiet, they will ask anybody in the car. How long? HOW FAR ARE WE ABOUT TO GET THERE? BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? You as an adult don't need to throw up tantrums. The only thing you need to do if you're traveling to Umbara and you want TO KNOW HOW FAR IS PULL OUT your phone and go to Google Maps and just tell Google I'm going to give me the vision of the TRIP AND GOOGLE WILL TELL YOU HOW MANY KILOMETERS FROM WHERE YOU ARE TO WHERE you are going. GOOGLE WILL TELL YOU HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE YOU. GOOGLE WILL TELL YOU EVEN WHETHER THERE IS A PROBLEM on the way if there is jam, &gt;&gt; traffic jam. &gt;&gt; Do you know Google will tell you? Hallelujah. you know, many times when I was, you know, in Australia and also in Canada, &gt;&gt; I noticed, you know, the the Google I think because I think more people use it and all that. It warns them of everything. These people of course everybody just goes and puts and things. So when someone sees police, &gt;&gt; they indicate there there is police. SO WHEN YOU'RE APPROACHING that Google will tell you so many people have reported there is police. So if you are over the limit, you will begin to reduce the speed because there is police there. They will tell you one lane is closed. If you YOU JUST DRIVE WITHOUT FOLLOWING THE VISION, you'll just GO AND RUN INTO a closed lane and you die. But because you have followed THE VISION, YOU WILL SEE IT AHEAD. YOU CANNOT SEE PHYSICALLY. BUT YOU CAN SEE BY EYES OF GOOGLE AND they will tell you there is a lane closed. They will tell you well it is snowing ahead and the vision is a bit blood. So go slow so you reduce. BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE GOOGLE AND YOU'RE JUST DRIVING, you will just go there and hit other cars. So friends, you see WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE VISION. IF YOU DON'T HAVE VISION, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE DESTROYED. BUT YOU SEE WHEN GOD, you know, PRESENTS HIS VISION FOR A SEASON, FOR A TIME, FOR A PLACE, FOR A PEOPLE, HE ALWAYS RAISES ONE MAN [screaming] TO BRING ABOUT THAT VISION. But the devil always raises many like him that WILL BRING DOUBT AND QUESTIONS. Praise God. And that's how even the spirit of gossip works. You know a good gossiper. Let me for one minute preach to you about a good gossiper. So that if you want to be a gossiper, you can be a good one. A good gossiper does not give statements. No. &gt;&gt; Enter into the spirit of what I'm saying cuz I've already talked about that. Brother, a good gospel doesn't give a statement. He says so much but without giving his stand. So he will come to you and say sister Monica &gt;&gt; what don't you see what is happening in the church these days you know brothers especially brother so and so you know they like dozing a lot I've been watching them don't you think they might be living in sin I DON'T KNOW BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO YOU think they may as they speaking THEY WANT YOU TO SAY SOMETHING a good GOSPEL ALWAYS WILL PROVOKE YOU TO SAY SOMETHING did God SAY DID GOD SAY SO Satan did GOD SAY WELL I DON'T KNOW BUT I'M ASKING YOU DID GOD SAY EVE FELL INTO THE TRAP? AND SHE SAID, "OH YEAH, [screaming] GOD NEVER SAID THAT." GOD SAY, "WE WILL NOT EAT OF ONLY ONE TREE AND WILL NOT EVEN TOUCH IT." SO SHE FELL INTO THE TRAP BY BEING EXCITED AND TALKING HER MIND AND SHE went and superseded the word. SO NOW A GOSSIPER WILL COME TO PROVOKE YOU. AND THEN IF YOU ARE ALSO SOMEONE WHO HAS A VERY LIGHT MOUTH, you will say, "OH YES, BROTHER. OH YES, I HAVE ALSO BEEN observing them. They have been dozing all the services. THEY MUST BE LIVING IN FORNICATION." NOW YOU WHEN YOU CAME TO THEM YOU DID the the first gospel did not tell you they're living in FORNICATION but they put words in your mouth LITERALLY he would tell don't you think THEY'RE NOT LIVING THE RIGHT KIND OF LIFE AND THEN SAY YEAH I KNEW IT THEY MUST BE LIVING IN FORNICATION THEN THIS SAME GOSSIPER THE ORIGINAL ONE WILL GO BEHIND YOUR BACK AND GO TO THESE VERY BROTHERS AND TELL THEM, "DO YOU KNOW WHAT BROTHER SO AND SO THINKS ABOUT YOU?" Can you imagine? HE SAID, "YOU ARE LIVING IN FORNICATION." AND THEN YOU WHO ALSO DOESN'T HAVE A VISION OF YOUR LIFE, you will begin boiling and then YOU WILL COME TO HOW CAN YOU TALK ABOUT ME LIKE THIS? AND THEN YOU WILL ALSO SAY, "NO, I never said it. I never SAID IT." BUT YOU ACTUALLY SAID IT, BUT ACTUALLY YOU NEVER SAID IT BECAUSE THE OTHER PERSON PUT IT in your MOUTH AND THEN YOU [screaming] WERE TRAPPED AS A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEN YOU WILL NOW SAY NO. IT IS THE OTHER THE OTHER one who told it who said it first and then you will. So now let me tell YOU THE ONLY WAY OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF GOSSIP. IF SOMEONE TELLS YOU SOMETHING ABOUT SOMEBODY tell them LET ME ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM WHEN THEY ARE THERE. YOU WILL SEE THE GOSPEL SAYING [screaming] I don't want you to involve me BUT YOU ALREADY INVOLVED. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED, WHY ARE YOU THE ONE SENDING GOSSIP EVERYWHERE? OH, YOU ARE NOW AWFULLY QUIET. ARE YOU GOSSIPERS? YOU SEE, THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO, SAINTS. TO KEEP US FOCUSED ON THE VISION. AMEN. We must always, you know, uh not allow OURSELVES TO BE TRAPPED. DON'T ALLOW ANYBODY TO TRAP YOU AS A victim of circumstances. If they tell you something about brother Brian, tell them okay for real is like that don't let us call brother Brian. We help him but you in your heart you know you are also helping the gospel. You see, gossip is a spirit and you know the political spirit usually uses or thrives on gossip. And we saw it on Sunday. How these brothers and Kora put themselves together to go against the man of the earth. And they said we we have how can is he the only one who HEARS FROM GOD? HE'S MAKING HIMSELF A PRINCE OVER US. &gt;&gt; And they brought, you know, they they began TO SPEAK BIG SWELLING WORDS. But but you see, they were politically motivated. But I want us to first refresh our our mind on this vision. What is this vision? In Exodus 3:8, he says, "I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up to out of the land unto a good land, a large land, UNTO A LAND FLOWING WITH milk and honey." Come on, church, say amen to that. And to a place of the Canonites, SO THE LAND THE VISION IS [screaming] GOD WANTED TO TAKE ISRAEL AND BRING THEM OUT OF EGYPT &gt;&gt; AND TAKE THEM TO CANANAN'S FAIR LAND. AMEN. And this land is good. This land IS LARGE IS FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY. THAT'S WHY HE SAYS I HAVE GOOD PLANS FOR YOU SAY THE LORD. PLANS TO PROSPER YOU. PLANS TO GIVE YOU A GOOD FUTURE. LET ME TELL YOU BROTHERS AND SISTERS, GOD HAS GOOD PLANS FOR US. AMEN. WE ARE KINGS AND PRIESTS. WE ARE ORDAINED OF THE LORD TO OVERCOME IN THIS GENERATION. WE ARE THE OVERCOMERS OUT OF WE CANNOT BE DEFEATED. WE ARE THE BRIDE OF CHRIST THAT IS IN DESTRUCTIBLE. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. WE ARE INVISIBLE. &gt;&gt; WE ARE POWERFUL. [screaming] WE ARE POWERFUL. &gt;&gt; WE ARE FULL OF THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; WHO ARE WE? WE ARE THE BRIDE of Jesus Christ, THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. &gt;&gt; WE DECIDE UPON THIS ROCK, [screaming] I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH. AND THE GATES OF HELL, WHICH MEANS THE GATES OF HELL ARE FIGHTING. AMEN. BUT THE GATES [screaming] OF HELL AS MUCH AS THEY FIGHTING US, THEY CANNOT PREVAIL. [screaming] &gt;&gt; AMEN. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT CHURCH? OH, BE ENCOURAGED in that TO KNOW NO MATTER WHAT YOU ARE WRESTLING WITH. THE GATES OF HELL shall never prevail. YOU MAY BE IN A MARRIAGE WHICH YOU THINK IS BECOMING TOXIC. DON'T TAKE COUNSEL FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD. THE MOMENT YOU GO TO YOUR AUNTIES AND [screaming] UNCLES AND BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH, YOU ARE DESTROYING YOURSELF. COME BACK TO [screaming] THE LORD BECAUSE THE WORD SAYS THE GATES OF HELL CANNOT PREVAIL. WHICH MEANS FOR YOU TO OVERCOME. AMEN. YOU NEED TO BE BUILT UPON THE REVELATION of Jesus Christ. Let me tell you brothers and sisters, IF ANYTHING STARTED WITHIN GOD, it is in God and it will be settled IN GOD BECAUSE THE ALPHA is the omega. Amen. Many times MYSELF AND MY WIFE WHEN WE HAVE HAD issues in our marriage, yes, we have had many of them. But you see some many of them we could handle ourselves. &gt;&gt; But there are those WHICH WE COULD WE FAIL TO HANDLE. &gt;&gt; WE FAILED TO handle them brother Matthew. BUT EACH TIME, AMEN. WE WOULD GO BACK TO THE [screaming] ONE WHO STARTED THIS BECAUSE HE SAID I AM THE ALPHA AND I AM THE OMEGA. &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; AND I WOULD ALWAYS TELL GOD, IF YOU GAVE THIS GIRL TO ME AND YOU GAVE THIS BOY [screaming] TO HER, THIS CANNOT FAIL BECAUSE OF THE LORD. AND THEN WE WOULD CALL ON THE WORD. WE WILL SANCTION THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST AND THE WORD NEVER FAILS. BUT WHAT TOLD US THE WORD OF GOD WILL NEVER FAIL IN ANY SITUATION, IN ANY PLACE, AT ANY TIME. WHEN YOU APPLY THAT WORD IT CAN NEVER FAIL. &gt;&gt; BUT THE PROBLEM OF IT, PEOPLE GO TO SEEK POLITICAL ADVICE. ANYONE WHO IS NOT ANOINTED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD, THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS TO COUNEL YOU ON THE THINGS THAT ARE SPIRITUAL. THAT'S WHY [screaming] WE HAVE A COLD CHURCH IN THIS END TIME. THE BIBLE SAY THEY'RE CALLED YOU KNOW THEY ARE LUKEWARM. WHY? BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY HAVE LEFT THE COUNSEL OF GOD THE COUNCIL OF HIS WORD AND THEY HAVE GONE into the world to seek for counsel. Friends I DON'T KNOW YOUR LIVES how you live EVERY DAY WHAT I'M SPEAKING NOW IS THE ANSWER TO YOUR PRAYERS BECAUSE YOU SAY LORD SPEAK TO ME. GOD IS SPEAKING TO YOU ACCORDING TO YOUR NEED. Praise God. Amen. AMEN. I'LL BRING THEM [screaming] OUT OF OF THIS LAND AND I'LL TAKE THEM TO A GOOD LAND, TO A LARGE LAND. GOD [screaming] HAS NO HAS NO intention of taking you to a bad place. GOD HAS NO INTENTION OF MAKING YOU POOR. [screaming] GOD HAS NO INTENTION OF MAKING YOU SAD, OF MAKING YOU BROKENHEARTED. GOD HAS NO INTENTION OF TAKING YOU TO A SQUEEZY PLACE. THE INTENTION OF GOD IS THE CAUSE, THE VISION. IT IS TO BRING [screaming] YOU TO A LAND THAT IS GOOD, A LAND THAT IS LARGE, A LAND [screaming] THAT IS FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY. WHAT IS THIS LAND? Later we will see IT IS THE HOLY GHOST. It's the LAND OF THE HOLY GHOST. IS THE LAND OF THE [screaming] WORD BUT ALSO IT IS BOTH PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL IN HIM. AMEN. IT IS TALKING ABOUT THE PLAN AND THE PURPOSE OF [screaming] GOD FOR YOU. GOD DEALS WITH ISRAEL AS A NATION. HE DEALS WITH GENTILES AS INDIVIDUALS. HE'S BRINGING ISRAEL [screaming] TO A PHYSICAL LAND. BUT I'M TELLING YOU, HE'S BRINGING YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL INTO A A PLACE, A PLACE OF VICTORY, A PLACE OF HAPPINESS, A PLACE THAT IS GOOD. WE CAN SAY I'M TIRED OF BAD. LET ME TELL YOU BELIEVERS. YOU MUST GET TIRED OF the good. THERE ARE EVEN SOME PEOPLE WHO THINK POVERTY [screaming] IS HOLINESS. IF YOU HAVE NO JOB, YOU'RE SPIRITUAL. BROTHER SISTER, YOU HAVE TO SAY NO. [screaming] NO. GOD DOESN'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU TO LIVE SORRY. TO YOU WHO ARE IN VACATIONS, BEGIN TO THINK AND BE. WHAT AM I GOING TO ACCOMPLISH IN THIS VACATION BOTH for the Lord AND FOR MY PROGRESS in life? You must be blessed [snorts] AND YOU MUST BE A BLESSING BECAUSE GOD IS BRINGING YOU TO A LAND THAT IS GOOD AND LARGE. I SAID GOOD AND LARGE, A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY. EVEN AS DVF, &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THAT LITTLE PLACE WE ARE BUYING THERE. &gt;&gt; OH, I CAN PROPHESY TO YOU AND I TELL YOU, WE SHALL HAVE THAT ENTIRE BLOCK. THE DEVIL IS SEEING US HERE IN SOMEONE'S BUILDING. AND WHEN WE SPEAK THIS, HE THINKS WE ARE JOKING. WHEN MOSES SPOKE TO PHARAOH, &gt;&gt; PHARAOH THOUGHT MOSES WAS JOKING. &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT JOKERS. [screaming] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT JOKERS. JUST WATCH THIS SPACE AND SEE. I SAID IN THE NAME OF THE LORD, WE ARE GOING TO OWN all that block. [screaming] &gt;&gt; YES SIR. FOR WHAT? NOT FOR OURSELVES. FOR THE WORK OF GOD. AMEN. A LAND THAT [screaming] IS GOOD AND LARGE. NOT ONE PLOT, NOT TWO PLOTS, LARGE. EVERYBODY SAY LARGE. LARGE. IF YOU HAVE ONE PLOT, BELIEVE FOR ANOTHER ONE. IF YOU HAVE TWO, BELIEVE FOR FOUR. WHATEVER YOU HAVE, BELIEVE FOR MORE BECAUSE OUR GOD IS A GOD OF MORE [screaming] AND MORE AND MORE. THERE IS MORE IN HIM. WE WILL NOT SETTLE FOR LESS. IF YOU HAVE ONE CHILD, BELIEVE FOR TWO. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CHILD, BELIEVE FOR ONE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A WIFE, [screaming] BELIEVE FOR ONE. OUR GOD IS A GOD OF MULTIPLICATION. [screaming] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND HE'S BRINGING US TO A LAND THAT A PLACE OF CANONITES, HITTITES, AMORITES, and Jeepites. Now, I want YOU TO IMAGINE THE vision was to BRING THEM TO SUCH A PLACE, GOOD and large, strong with milk and honey. BUT THE PLACE was filled with the adversary. Amen. Your promise FROM GOD, the vision GOD HAS FOR YOU, HE SHOULD BRING YOU TO SUCH A PLACE I'VE talked about. If you're living A LIFE OF SIN, HE WANTS TO TAKE YOU OUT OF IT AND TO MAKE YOU HOLY AND TO MAKE YOU PERFECT AND TO MAKE YOU AN AMBASSADOR OF THE KINGDOM ON EARTH. BUT YOU SEE THIS PLACE IN CHRIST IS NOT EASY TO GET INTO. WHY DOES it man REVELATION IS FLOWING? WHY DOES IT SEEM AS IF YOU ARE FIGHTING EVERY DAY? AMEN. YOU DON'T WANT TO LIE. YOU FIND YOURSELF LYING. YOU DON'T WANT TO LAUGH. YOU CUT YOURSELF. YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS. YOU FIND YOURSELF. WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING? FIGHTING. IT SEEMS AS IF YOU'RE FIGHTING YOURSELF BECAUSE THE DEVIL IS HOLDING YOUR LAND. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE CANONITES ARE STILL THERE. THE ARE STILL THERE. THE ARE STILL THERE. BUT I HAVE A WORD FROM THE LORD THIS MORNING. THE HEATERS MUST DIE. THE MUST DIE. THE AMORITES MUST DIE. THE MUST DIE. MUST DIE. [screaming] THE LAND IS OURS. I SAID THE LAND IS YOURS. WHATEVER GOD EVER REDEMPTIVE PROMISE IN HIS WORD IS YOURS. I SAID IS YOURS. [screaming] &gt;&gt; DON'T LOOK AT ME JUST SAY IT IS YOURS. EVERY PROMISE HE HAS GIVEN IN HIS WORD BELONGS TO ME AND MY FAMILY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And amen. &gt;&gt; So he promised Israel. and I'm going to take you to this land. SO THAT MEANS GOD ENVISIONED THAT HIS PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE OUT. [laughter] AMEN. THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND AND TO POSSESS IT. THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO possess because someone IS POSSESSING IT. BUT YOU MUST POSSESS. YOU CAN'T POSSESS WITHOUT FIGHTING. AND TO FIGHT YOU WILL OVERCOME BECAUSE THERE IS A PROMISE ON YOUR HEAD THAT YOU ARE AN OVERCOMER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY SAY I MUST POSSESS. I MUST POSSESS. I MUST POSSESS. AM I PREACHING TO PENTECOSTALS? I MUST POSSESS. I MUST POSSESS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THIS IS THE TYPE OF THE VISION [screaming] GOD HAS FOR the New Testament church today. THE TRUE CHURCH I SAID MUST POSSESS EVERY REDEMPTIVE PROMISE of God in this hour. WE MUST DRIVE OUT EVERY ENEMY OUT OF OUR LAND. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We must DRIVE THEM OUT. SOME OF YOU ARE FIGHTING A HARDER BATTLE. It means your portion is bigger. [cheering] God bless you, brother Martin. BROTHER MARTIN, DO YOU WANT A PROPHECY? JESUS CAME FROM HEAVEN FOR YOU. YOUR PORTION is bigger. YOUR PORTION IS BIGGER. THE DEVIL IS FIGHTING YOU BIG BECAUSE HE KNOWS. [screaming] AMEN. YOUR PORTION IS BIGGER. SO HE'S BRINGING A BIGGER FIGHT. AMEN. BUT LET [screaming] ME TELL YOU, HE THAT IS IN US IS GREATER THAN HE THAT IS IN THE WORLD. WE MUST OVERCOME THIS. WE MUST POSSESS EVERY PIECE OF OUR LAND. SEE HOW ISRAEL REGARDLESS OF WHAT AMERICA SAY DURING during you know Biden and all others YOU KNOW THEY WERE NOT EVEN WERE THREATENING TO PULL OUT BUT YOU KNOW THIS prime minister of Israel came this a political Israel really but he still gives US THE PICTURE THEN HE CAME UP AND HE SAID HE GAVE A STATEMENT HE SAID REGARDLESS OF WHO IS STANDING WITH US. We [screaming] are GOING TO FIGHT. AND THEY DIDN'T SAY THEY'RE GOING TO DIE, BUT THEY SAID WE ARE GOING TO DESTROY EVERY ONE [screaming] OF OUR ENEMIES. WE ARE GOING TO DESTROY. AMEN. THE THE THE THE WAR UH YOU KNOW THE YOU KNOW ALL THESE enemies that ARE IN GAZA. IMAGINE AT THE SAME TIME SEVERAL TIME SEVERAL TIMES ISRAEL HAS FOUGHT A BATTLE A war and MANY ADVERSARIES AT THE SAME TIME has brought US FROM THIS SIDE FROM THIS SIDE. I RAN FROM THIS AND all of them, you know, SHOOTING AT THEM. AND ISRAEL, IF YOU SEE IT ON THE MAP, IT IS ONE LITTLE STRIP OF LAND. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE IS A BIG PROMISE BEHIND THEM. WHEN WHEN THEY ASKED THEM, "WHERE IS YOUR LAND?" THEY SAID, "OUR LAND IS IN PALESTINE." AND AT ONE TIME THEY TOLD THEM, "WELL, GO AND SETTLE IN UGANDA." THEY WANTED THEM TO SETTLE HERE. BUT HE SAID, "NO, WE [screaming] KNOW WHERE OUR LAND IS. GOD PROMISED US THIS PIECE OF LAND AND IT IS OURS." AND AMEN. THERE WERE PEOPLE THERE ALREADY. BUT YOU KNOW, FOR ALL THESE CENTURIES, ISRAEL HAS FOUGHT WARS AND BATTLES. WARS AND BATTLES. BUT IN EACH OF THEM, THEY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN CONQUERORS. WHY? THERE IS A PROMISE BEHIND THAT NATION. I CAN TELL YOU BROTHER SISTER WE ARE MORE SPECIAL THAN ISRAEL. THE BIBLE SAYS WE ARE HOLY NATION. WE ARE ROYAL PRIESTHOOD. WE ARE HERE TO FIGHT ALSO LIKE [screaming] ISRAEL. WE MUST OVERCOME EVERY ONE OF OUR ENEMIES. WE MUST POSSESS EVERY PIECE OF GROUND THAT GOD [screaming] PROMISED US. REGARDLESS OF WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING AGAINST US, WE DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAYING. WE DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAYING BECAUSE WE HAVE SOMEONE THAT IS BIGGER THAN ANY NATION BACKING [screaming] US. SOMEONE BIGGER THAN AMERICA, SOMEONE BIGGER THAN RUSSIA. [screaming] AMEN. AMEN. SOMEONE CALLED JESUS IS BEHIND THE BRIDE. IF YOU can receive a revelation IS STANDING WITH YOU THEN YOU WILL KNOW EVEN IN YOUR POVERTY YOU CAN overcome even in your PROBLEMS IN YOUR MARRIAGE YOU CAN BREAK OUT OF IT YOU CAN KNOW EVEN IN THINGS WHICH YOU THOUGHT NO ONE CAN SOLVE GOD IS ABLE TO SOLVE THEM STOP HANDLING THINGS MECHANICALLY ENTER INTO THE SPIRIT AMEN AMEN. AND THEN FOCUS ON THE VISION THAT WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN IN THIS HOUR. THE VISION OF THIS HOUR IS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; CHRIST. EVERYBODY SAY CHRIST. &gt;&gt; BUT WE KNOW CHRIST WAS IN JESUS. BUT TODAY THAT SAME [screaming] CHRIST IS IN YOU AND I. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; The God explain says your loving arms around every man and every woman and may our vision OUR VISION, our sight MAY BE RAISED HIGHER AND HIGHER than the THINGS OF THE WORLD THAT WE MAY SEEK CHRIST. SEE NOTHING, HEAR NOTHING WRONG. HEAR NOTHING WRONG. See nothing wrong. SPEAK NOTHING WRONG. SEEK CHRIST IN YOUR BROTHER. AND BROTHER PRAYS AND HE SAYS, "LORD, MAY OUR VISION GO HIGHER AND HIGHER AND HIGHER THAT WE MAY SEE &gt;&gt; AND OTHERS MAY SEE CHRIST IN US." &gt;&gt; I SAY HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF THIS GENERATION SAID HIS ONLY GOD, his only cause, HIS ONLY VISION WOULD BE TO SEE THE PEOPLE RESTORED BACK. THAT relationship with God. SEE, IT'S ALL ABOUT CHRIST. Brother Shalom sang a song. It's all about you, Jesus. You didn't even know what I was preaching about this morning. YES. IT'S ALL ABOUT CHRIST. CHRIST IS OUR VISION. Can you tell your neighbor Christ is our vision? Amen. Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In resume of agency he says let me quote that for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We believe brother Bham to be the prophet of this hour. We always quote his messages but many people don't know why because brother Bham is a prophet to this age. He is a man that God gave the vision for the bride of the last day. Your amens are very weak. [panting] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you feel good, brother Henry? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What do you Why do you think you're feeling good? &gt;&gt; Because the anointing of God, &gt;&gt; the stimulation of revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you're feeling good. &gt;&gt; I want you to begin absorbing now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; brother. There are seven angels to the seven churches. To every church, to every church there is an angel which is a prophet messenger. AND THAT PROPHET MESSENGER HAD A VISION FOR THAT AGE. Some people you know they see we always told talk to them and they see Elijah the first Elijah quickly. Then they see Elisha he was Elijah. Then they see John THE BAPTIST. ELIJAH. THEN WHEN IT COMES TO OUR DAY, THEY SAID, "NO, NO, NO. It's the Holy Spirit upon many people." He say, "Sorry, &gt;&gt; sorry for them. &gt;&gt; They don't understand it. They don't understand it." If God send the spirit of Elijah on one man, why would he in the end time send upon many? Even in our age, he sent it to one man in our generation. One man to the whole world. But remember brothers and sisters, this Elijah is not the first prophet to come. He would be the last messenger to the last age. AND THE OTHERS FROM THE FIRST AGE, SECOND BOOK, ALL of them WE ARE STANDING AS HOLDERS OF THE VISION OF THE BRIDE IN THEIR AGE. [screaming] SO WILLIAM BRHAM &gt;&gt; IS CARRYING THE VISION FOR OUR AGE. THAT'S WHY WE QUOTE HIM A LOT BECAUSE HE'S OUR PASTOR IN THAT SENSE. Your amens ARE VERY WEAK IN THAT SENSE. WILLIAM BRANDHAM IS THE PASTOR OF THE LAST AGE. WHY? BECAUSE THE PASTOR THE PASTOR IS THE VISION BEARER OF THE CHURCH AND EVERY CHURCH IS SOVEREIGN. I KNOW THERE ARE OTHERS WHO USE THAT IN THE WRONG SENSE SAY OH YEAH BECAUSE OF THAT WE NEED TO LISTEN TO ONLY WILLIAM BRHAM. WE ARE FAILING TO UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN REDEMPTION HAS SEASONS. WE ARE IN ANOTHER [screaming] SEASON NOW. AMEN. AND EVERY SEASON, GOD USES MEN AND FOR A GENERATION. GOD HAS SENT US A PROPHET AND GOD TAKES MEN IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD AND HE ANOINTS THEM TO BREAK DOWN THAT BREAD TO THE CHILDREN IN EVERY PLACE IN EVERY NATION IN EVERY TOWN. AMEN. I SAID AMEN. [screaming] IF GOD WOULD CALL A MAN TO PREACH AND HE CALLS OTHERS TO LISTEN TO TAPES ONLY, THEN HE'S NOT A FAIR GOD. &gt;&gt; THEN HE IS NOT A FAIR GOD. GOD AT EVERY TIME HE WILL RAISE A MAN TO PREACH. AMEN. [screaming] HE RAISED PAUL AND PAUL PREACHED THE MESSAGE AND PAUL SAID IF ANY MAN [screaming] EVEN IF HE'S AN ANGEL HE COMES DOWN AND PREACHES ANOTHER GOSPEL LET HIM BE A [screaming] DIFFERENT GOSPEL AND THEN WILLIAM CAME AND HE SAID HALLELUJAH I PREACH WHAT PREACH AMEN HE DID NOT PLAY [screaming] PAUL STEP ONLY. HALLELUJAH. BUT HE PREACHED. AMEN. WHAT PREACH WE ARE PREACHING WHAT WILLIAM PREACHED ON THE TAPE. WE ARE NOT SAYING ANYTHING DIFFERENT. It's the same Holy Spirit. [screaming] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we shy away from dealing with those things. But then you need to know you need to rightly divide the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you're streaming and you're offended by that, I'm speaking to my local congregation. AND HERE THIS NOW GIVES A disclaimer in the regime of ages. I sincerely believe that THE SPIRIT OF GOD, PUT IT UP HERE, THE SPIRIT OF GOD HAS BEEN SPEAKING to us is meaning through his ministry. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOT ONLY TEACHING US THE TRUTH OF THE AGES, &gt;&gt; BUT HE HAS BEEN FAITHFULLY DEALING WITH [screaming] HEARTS, that they may turn to him. THAT IS THE REASON FOR ALL PREACHING AND TEACHING. FOR IT IS THE PREACHING AND TEACHING OF THE WORD, THAT THE SHEEP HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD AND [screaming] AND THEN NOW HE SAYS, "NOT FOR ONE MOMENT DO I BRING A MESSAGE to the people." THAT THEY MAY FOLLOW ME. AMEN. WE ARE NOT FOLLOWERS OF WILLIAM. THAT IS NOT A PURPOSE OF THE MESSAGE. THAT'S NOT THE VISION OF THE MESSAGE. HEAR WHAT BROTHER BON HIMSELF SAID. I DIDN'T BRING THE MESSAGE THAT THE PEOPLE MAY JOIN MY CHURCH. WE ARE NOT HERE TO START A BRAND. NO SIR [screaming] OR START SOME FELLOWSHIP AND ORGANIZATION. THIS MESSAGE DID NOT COME SO THAT WE HAVE DAYS OF THE VOICE FELLOWSHIP SO THAT WE HAVE A BIG CHURCH. THAT IS NOT A PURPOSE. THAT'S NOT [screaming] A VISION. I HAVE NEVER DONE THAT. AND I WON'T DO THAT NOW. I HAVE NO INTEREST IN THE THINGS. BUT I HAVE INTERESTED THE THINGS OF GOD AND THE PEOPLE. AND IF I CAN ACCOMPLISH JUST ONE THING, JUST ONE THING, JUST ONE THING, NOT TWO, NOT THREE, NOT FOUR, [screaming] ONE THING I WILL BE SATISFIED. ASK YOUR NEIGHBOR, WHAT IS THAT ONE THING? THAT ONE THING IS TO SEE ESTABLISHED A TRUE [screaming] RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOD AND [screaming] AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE PURPOSE OF THE MESSAGE IS TO RESTORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOD AND MAN. AMEN. AMEN. WHEREIN MEN BECOME NEW CREATIONS IN CHRIST FILLED WITH THEIR SPIRIT FILLED WITH [screaming] THEIR SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AND LIVE ACCORDING TO HIS WORD. I would invite everyone and plead and want all to hear his VOICE AT THIS TIME AND YIELD YOUR lives completely TO HIM. EVEN as I TRUST IN MY HEART, I HAVE GIVEN MY ALL TO HIM. GOD BLESS YOU AND may his coming. He did not SAY IF HE COMES. HE SAID HE IS COMING BECAUSE HE KNOWS if this relationship IS BREACHED AGAIN JESUS MUST COME. BEHOLD I SEND YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET BEFORE [screaming] THE COMING OF THE LORD. AMEN. I JUST THERE. LET ME TELL YOU AFTER ELIJAH COMES. AMEN. Then the MESSIAH COMES. MAY HE'S COMING REJOICE YOUR HEART. WHY? BECAUSE ELIJAH'S COME. BECAUSE ELIJAH IS COMING, THE MESSIAH MUST COME. BECAUSE ELIJAH IS [screaming] COMING. CHRIST IS HERE. &gt;&gt; HE IS NOT COMING ONLY. HE IS [screaming] HERE. WHERE IS HE? HE'S IN ME. SEE CHRIST IN ME. SEE CHRIST IN YOUR BROTHER. CHRIST IS HERE IN THE FORM of the bride. So this message is not to promote a man. IT IS TO PROMOTE CHRIST. EVERYBODY SAID CHRIST. CHRIST. THIS WILL QUICKEN OUR MORTAL BODIES. THIS WILL RENEW OUR MINDS. THIS WILL TAKE US IN OUR FUTURE HOME. LET US THEREFORE PREACH THIS MESSAGE. ALWAYS POINTING [screaming] PEOPLE TO CHRIST. OUR CAUSE, OUR GOAL, OUR VISION IS CHRIST, BROTHER. THAT'S WHY WE TRANSLATE THE MESSAGE. THAT'S WHY WE PRINT THE MESSAGE. THOSE [screaming] STEPS, THOSE BOOKS, BROTHER, WHEN YOU EAT IT UP, [screaming] WHEN YOU EAT IT UP, SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND YOU WILL PROPHESY AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. True believers. Listen to the message. If you don't, you are not you've not yet proved who you are. If you have no appetite, it's like saying you're a human being. But you are eating slow stones. You've not proved you're a human being. Eat food. Have the appetite for food. And then I will know WHO YOU ARE. BROTHER, ARE YOU FEEDING ON THE WORD? BUT THERE ARE MANY men in this hour that have risen, amen, with political motivations and they're doing their maneuvers converting the people from to a man instead of Christ. Amen. We have TWO EXTREMES. OTHERS ARE saying William Brham was not a prophet of God and the message is not true. Those ones, even the Pentecostals, they are better than them. Even the Pentecostals not better. &gt;&gt; Who is this man in Zimbabwe who has a big following? Who but angel? &gt;&gt; I wanted to say it on the microphone here. Someone will go and search it out. This man, he flows in the prophetic prophesies here and there and but he HAS SAID ON COUNTLESS OCCASIONS that William Brham &gt;&gt; was a prophet of another real one of his disciples was asking him how do we compare what you're doing with what DID WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? How can you put my name and William on the same on the same sentence? Is something wrong with you? He was speaking to his followers. Say William, you can't even put my name and his name. One brother in Zimbabwe, friend of mine, I'll not mention the name. He told me, you know, he spoke to this brother who I also know very well preached for him uh in the UK. He's a pastor also originally from Zimbabwe. &gt;&gt; He told me he spoke to Wubert Angel &gt;&gt; and he introduced the message to him and and then Wbert asked him a question. He said, "Brother," he asked his name. He said, "Brother, I have a question for you. Who is the message believer?" And this brother said, uh, before he could answer him, angel pulled out his his iPad and he scrolled and he brought all the sermons of brotherham and he told him. I read all his messages. I listen to all of them and I believe all of them. So can you now can you believe a message believer then? So they believe this message to be the but they may not even be in the bride. They know I'm talking about the Pentecostals. They know that William Br was a major prophet. HE WAS A VISION BEARER IN THIS GENERATION. They know. So that EXTREME OF PEOPLE WHO ARE POLITICALLY MOTIVATED. THEY CAME IN A MESSAGE SAT FOR A FEW YEARS AND THEN LEFT UNSATISFIED and they said the message is not true. is because they themselves are confused and they don't know the identity. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, WE HAVE ANOTHER EXTREME. THESE ARE THE ONES WHO SAY, "WELL, WILLIAM BRANDHAM [screaming] IS A PROPHET OF THIS HOUSE." THAT'S TRUE. BUT THEN THEY SAY HE ALONE IS THE ONE WHO MUST PREACH. YOU IN YOUR CHURCH, YOUR PASTOR MUST SIT DOWN AND WE MUST PLAY THE TEMPLE. FOR BROTHER BHAM BECAUSE HE ALONE HAS THE GRACE FOR THE HOUSE TO PREACH BUT BROTHER BHAM IS DEAD FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS HE CAN'T PREACH BUT WE CAN PLAY HIS STEP AND LISTEN TO IT SO you can't tell me that he can preach but you can LISTEN TO HIS STEP ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS AND THEY ARE SO DECEIVED THAT THEY WILL GO AHEAD TO TO TO EVEN PUT YOU KNOW THE TAPE to w them. They'll put a TYP as if THE GOD 50 YEARS AGO IS NOT ALIVE TODAY. OTHERS WILL TAKE THE PIT OF FIRE PICTURE. THEY BAPTIZE SOMEBODY AND THEN THEY PUT IT ON THEIR HEAD. Oh my brothers and sisters, THAT'S [screaming] ANOTHER SIDE. THEY LEFT OFF THE LINE. BUT BROTHER BAM HIMSELF SHOUTED OUT AND HE SAID, "STAY ON THE [screaming] LINE. STAY ON THE LINE. DON'T GO TO THE LEFT. DON'T GO TO THE RIGHT. [screaming] STAY ON THE LINE. [cheering] HALLELUJAH. SO WE BELIEVE IN PLAYING TAPES. WE PLAY THEM IN OUR HOMES. BY THE WAY, WE CAN EVEN PLAY IT IN THE CHURCH. IF GOD LEADS US, WE CAN EVEN PLAY IT IN THE CHURCH. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. WE CAN PLAY BY THE BOTTOM STEP OR ANY OTHER PREACHER STEP. THAT'S OKAY. BUT WE CANNOT MAKE IT AS A STANDARD AS A DOCTRINE. SAY NO MORE PREACHING ONLY PLAYING TAPES. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters. I am sorry because God called me to preach. I am preaching my conviction. Amen. I AM ANSWERABLE TO THE LORD FOR WHAT I SAY. IF YOU DISAGREE, YOU CAN also hold your opinion and say it when you get a chance to preach. BUT BEFORE GOD GIVES YOU A MICROPHONE FOR NOW, HEAR WHAT I'M TELLING YOU. AMEN. SO LET'S PREACH THIS MESSAGE. LET'S BELIEVE THE MESSAGE. LET'S LISTEN TO IT. [screaming] LET US READ IT. BUT REMEMBER, WE SHOULD ALWAYS POINT PEOPLE TO CHRIST. [screaming] IN THE NAME OF JESUS, I SAY THAT IS OUR GOD. That is our cause. THAT IS OUR VISION. CHRIST IS OUR VISION. BROTHER, CHRIST IS OUR GOD. [cheering] On Sunday, we learn that God assigns a man with a mission to project a vision to of a generation. or to a group of people, a vision of a season, time and moment. IT MAY SOUND FUNNY, BUT GOD DOES NOT SEND A GROUP OF MEN TO PROJECT his vision. But he sends a man in a generation. He sends a man. There are others, BUT ONE MAJOR PROPHET. PAUL WAS a major prophet but there was Agabas a minor prophet so don't not misunderstand me God uses others vision BEARER [screaming] in DVF WE HAVE MANY GOOD PREACHERS MAYBE SOME WHO EVEN TO YOU SOME OF YOU WHO PREACH BETTER than I do AND THAT'S OKAY BY THE WAY DVF IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO HAVE YOUR FAVORITE PREACHER AND FOR YOU TO SAY MY pastor is NOT MY FAVORITE PREACHER, THAT'S OKAY. Let me even go ahead and SAY THIS. IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO HAVE YOUR FAVORITE PREACHER NOT BEING YOUR PASTOR when he's another preacher, another pastor. Maybe even here in Kala. IT IS OKAY. SOME OF YOU WHO ARE RELIGIOUS are now you are having a headache now. [screaming] IT IS FINE. THERE IS NO LAW BROKEN. TELL YOUR NEIGHBOR NO LAW BUT LAUGH. IT'S OKAY TO HAVE A FAVORITE PREACHER. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU MUST HAVE A HOME CHURCH. A PLACE WHERE YOU SUPPORT THE CAUSE. WHAT CAUSE? THE VISION. WHICH MEANS THERE MUST BE A MAN, A PASTOR WHO HAS A VISION THAT YOU BELIEVE TO BE THE VISION OF GOD FOR YOUR LIFE. AND THEN YOU SIT UNDER THAT MINISTRY. YOU SUPPORT IT WITH YOUR OFFERINGS, WITH YOUR TITHE. SOME OF YOU DON'T EVEN pay tithe. YOU WILL NEVER PROSPER. I TELL YOU, IF YOU WANT TO PROSPER IN YOUR FINANCIAL LIFE, PAY TITHE. I'm now not speaking this as me. I'm speaking IN MY OFFICE NOW. I AM ANOINTING NOW. IF I LISTEN TO THIS AFTERWARDS, I'll feel so bad about myself. TELL YOUR NEIGHBOR, PAY TITHE. EVERY BELIEVER MUST PAY TITHE. One brother told me a pastor. He said, WELL, SOME PEOPLE WILL COME AND TELL YOU, PASTOR, I HAVE SO MANY NEEDS UNTIL I CAN'T PAY MY TITHE. AND I TOLD HIM, BROTHER, CHANGE IT. SAYING THAT PHRASE AND SAY IT THIS WAY. I HAVE SO MANY NEEDS NOT TO PAY MY TITHE BECAUSE YOUR MONEY IS not 10%. That is God is. BUT IF YOU ARE EVEN WITH 90 OR EVEN 100 OF WHAT YOU THINK you have, you can never take care of your needs. BUT IF YOU HONOR GOD, AMEN. AND SUPPORT THE CAUSE, GOD HIMSELF WILL HONOR YOU AND POWER. [cheering] AMEN. &gt;&gt; Friend of mine, Pastor Tim. Now that brother Ed is dead, brother Tim is my mentor now. I met brother Tim in uh Germany and we sitting down talking about ministry and you know he has had a ministry of over 50 years and he told me we're talking about finances in ministry and he told me see brother I'll tell you something you know you're doing a great some other personal things. And then he told me this, "Teach your people to tithe. God will bless your work. Teach your people to tithe." And he told me this. He said, "I I've had a few brothers here and there come up in the church and I've told me of their financial wars in his church and I always bring them. They come to me for prayer. I bring them and I tell them to open Malachi chapter 3. Will a man rob God and yet you have robbed me? And you say wherein in tes and offers bring all your TES AND OFFERS AND see me here with AND SEE IF POWER A BLESSING FROM heaven that you will not have a place to KEEP ME. AND HE TOLD ME I ALWAYS TAKE BREAK COME HERE BROTHER. I ALWAYS TAKE THESE these people come just come. I always you yourself give me a hand. I always take these people and I take their finger and I point at that scripture and I tell them I DON'T NEED TO PRAY FOR YOU BROTHER. DO WHAT THE BIBLE says and the blessing is already. And he told me remember this is a ministry for more than 50 years. So he's saying something which is time tested and proven. Recently I was dealing with a brother before he's a member of this church before he was really very well and and and NOW THINGS WERE BAD EVERYWHERE. And I remember I prayed for wait you used to be what happened but do you pay your tithe I knew that's THE REASON SO FRIENDS SUPPORT THE CAUSE YOU MUST HAVE a home church where you support the cause and you must by the way you're blessed to have a pastor who is not money hungry I don't preach to you because of your money because I have a calling upon my life and I'm burdened to speak what I speak and for you to pay your tithe is not helping me. Pastor, you're rude. I'm sorry. Is the anointing making me this? You're not helping me. You're helping yourself. Because if you don't pay your tithe, you cannot prosper for 10% amens. But that's okay. Usually pastors fear to talk about this. They even fear to ask people to give money to go to a camp or meet or conference or whatever. BUT THE MORE THEY ARE FEAR [screaming] TO DO THAT, THE MORE the people suffer and THE MORE THE PASTORS BEG our we a little church here. SEE HOW MUCH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH. I'm talking about financially. We hold a youth camp. Every year for 4 years now and every year it costs not less than 50 million. We bu we were buying a church plot AND WE ONLY A FEW PEOPLE. WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT? ONLY GOD CAN DO THAT. WHY? BECAUSE IF YOU CATCH THE VISION, YOU MAY PAY YOUR TITHE AS 1,000, 2,000, 5,000. IT DOESN'T MATTER. GOD PROMISED A BLESSING. BUT THE BLESSING, HE DID NOT SAY IT WILL BE MONEY. THE BLESSING OF GOD MAKES RICH. IT COMES IN MANY FORM. Praise God. If we can have 50 people in this church totally focused on the vision, then would have a church that would shake this country. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This region, this continent, now you may look at me as a dreamer. I am it is vision disturbing and when God gives you vision because gives you a vision which is bigger than you. If if it is smaller than you then it's not vision [snorts] but it's bigger than you something you think you can never but then God anoints you believe it is possible and then he gives you people who BELIEVE IN YOUR VISION THAT KIND OF CHURCH IT CAN accomplish a lot for the kingdom &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; You see, you can have a favorite preacher. BUT IN EVERY LOCAL CHURCH, there is a vision bearer. GOD GIVES A VISION WITHOUT THE direction of the church. This man is under divine assignment FROM THE LORD. HE GOES OUT. IT IS A RISKY THING FOR ANYONE to reject him. It is risky to ridicule him. It is risky to disrespect him. BECAUSE TO YOU, HE'S A MAN OF THE HOUR. AMEN. They risk failing to catch the vision of the hour. if you fail to understand the man of your heart. And this is a quote which Brother Glover sent me which I'm just going to read for you right now. And by the way, he asked me to greet the church. Amen. Brother Glover is a wonderful preacher. Bless &gt;&gt; us in the youth camp, but he's younger than I. uh he looks much older though trying to do God a service without being the will of God. I encourage each and every one of us to go and listen to that message. Oh man, I was so excited when the brother sent me this quote. I was so excited and God bless him. But I want to read it for you. &gt;&gt; And I just took a paragraph, two paragraphs before and after, but the one he sent me is in the middle, but I'll just read it all. SAYS, "GOD REVEALS THIS word in the season." Put it up here, brother. And to whom he chooses revealing. God chooses who he reveals it to. Thank God for choosing me. Thank God for choosing him. IN THIS HOUR. HE CHOSE THAT BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. ALL OF HIS DOINGS WERE FOR KNOWN by him, hidden from man. HE JUST REVEALS THEM AS he will. IT IS HIS CHOSEN SEASON, HIS CHOSEN PERSON. TELL YOUR NEIGHBOR, CHOSEN SEASON, CHOSEN [screaming] PERSON. WHO IS IT THAT WILL DARE TO CORRECT HIM? THIS MAN DOESN'T BELIEVE LIKE WE BELIEVE. WHO IS GOING TO TELL GOD HE'S WRONG IN IT? IT WOULD TAKE SOMEBODY THAT'S A LITTLE MORE OF A DELUANT THAN I AM to tell him that. HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING. Tell your neighbor, GOD KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS WHO TO CHOOSE. HE KNOWS WHO NOT TO CHOOSE. NOW, let me talk to the married people. GOD, [screaming] YOU MIGHT THINK HE MADE A CHOICE. AMEN. God chose FOR YOU. GOD KNOWS [screaming] WHAT HE'S DOING. NEVER SAY I MADE A BAD DECISION. IF YOU A CHILD OF GOD, [screaming] WHERE YOU ARE NOW, WHO YOU HAVE NOW, [screaming] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT WAS GOD'S CHOICE. MANY OF YOU HAVE FATHERS, MOTHERS [screaming] YOU DON'T LIKE, BUT GOD CHOSE THEM FOR YOU. YOU SEE, IT IS GOD'S [screaming] CHOICE. WHATEVER HE CHOOSES IS GOOD. YOU CAN'T QUESTION HIM. &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; STOP GRUMBLING AND MURMURING. who to choose and who not to choose, where to do and when to DO IT. NO MATTER HOW MUCH [screaming] WE THINK THAT A CERTAIN PERSON IS QUALIFIED TO DO A CERTAIN JOB, GOD KNOWS WHO IS QUALIFIED FOR THE TIME AND THE SEASON OR THE TIME [screaming] AND THE RIGHT TIME TO DO IT. HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. YOU MAY BE CALLED. YOU MAY BE CHOSEN TO DO SOMETHING, BUT YOU DON'T DISCERN THE SEASON AND YOU MESS UP EVERYTHING. MOSES WAS CALLED. MOSES WAS CHOSEN TO LIBERATE THE JEWS, THE ISRAELITES, BUT HE DID NOT DISCERN THE TIME. HE DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TRAINING FOR THEM. AND HE KILLED A man right man wrong SEASON DOING GOD A SERVICE WITHOUT IT BEING HIS WILL. I remember when we MOVED TO CAMPALA. MY pastor moved me here and uh precious. I remember your dad was one of those and a few other people and we came HERE PRAYING FOR THE will of God. I wanted to stay in Mitana. But I I I felt in my spirit that was not the will of God because there were people who had believed in this area and they needed a shepherd. I was pulled to come here. I DIDN'T HAVE NO MONEY, NOTHING. NO one sponsored me or supported me. Not even a dime. We came and looked for A PLACE. WHILE I WAS DRIVING AROUND, I HAD THIS uh first car that I had and very nice car, very cool, well insulated. It was a Toyota or something. &gt;&gt; So then I was driving. I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE CUZ I JUST HAD people do it like this. BUT I JUST HAD STEPPED THROUGH A THREE phase because I REALIZED AS I WAS DANCING. I was dancing because of THE EFFECT OF THE POWER went through me. I was supposed to die right over there somewhere around those regions and uh you know AND THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; I JUST COME TO MYSELF WHEN I was dying and I and I and I and I AND I I STEPPED ON THE on the accelerator. IT COULDN'T GO. BUT FRIENDS, THE ANGEL of the LORD WAS THERE BEFORE I KNEW IT. MY CAR WAS OUT OF THAT ELECTRICITY zone and I stepped out. Everybody was doing this. There are many people around. Everybody knew I was supposed to die. BUT THE DEVIL KNEW THAT YOU WOULD BE HERE TODAY. WHENEVER GOD CALLS A MAN INTO A PLACE, INTO A TIME, INTO A SEASON, THERE ARE MANY ADVERSARIES. BUT ALWAYS GOD IS AVAILABLE TO FIGHT. [screaming] WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT AT that time, I didn't even have an idea to start a church. Long story short, WE START A HOME HERE. my family moves and I will find out. I do not have at a time an idea. So, Lord, should I join other churches? Because I saw myself more of a missionary than I am a pastor. But I said maybe just one one church AND THEN WHEN WE TRIED TO DO IT, THE LORD SPOKE TO ME AND MY WIFE, NO. I said, "Now what Lord So I decided to speak to a few pastors, hear the opinions. But let me tell you brother, some people when you are confused, they will give you their opinions. Some of them WILL BE FROM GOD, OTHERS WILL BE FROM THEM, OTHERS WILL BE FROM the devil. Be sure you have heard from God. So then, LONG STORY SHORT, THE LORD DEALT WITH US ON ONE TIME, ONE EVENING, IMPRESS IT UPON me to start a fellowship right away. And we started in the home with only my family. Now friends, why am I saying that? You see, that was the season. God had it in mind. It was the season for that ministry to start. When I say ministry, God has given me a gift. Our ministry is not mine. Is for the people of that season he has intended for you. Some of you preachers who are here. Some of you are preachers and you're ALREADY PREACHING. OTHERS you are preachers and you have not yet start launched out. Others you don't even know yet. But yet YOU ARE PREACHERS. WORLD HAS a sense of humor AND HE KNOWS WHAT TO DO WHEN AND SOMETIMES WHAT IS WHAT HE DOES IS LAUGHABLE. SO WHEN WE WERE STARTING I KNOW MANY MEN LAUGHED AT US. THEY THOUGHT WE WERE JOKING. When with 15 PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH WE ANNOUNCED WE ARE STARTING LAND FUND. HOW MUCH MONEY? 150 MILLIONS we are looking for. SOME OF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH. thieves and robbers and conmen and you remember that some of you. But let me tell you, if a vision is OF THE HOLY SPIRIT and a season is right, the devil can't stop it. Hallelujah. Amen. AND WHEN YOU ARE BURDENED WITH A VISION, IT'S THE RIGHT SEASON AND YOU'RE THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB, EVEN YOU CAN'T STOP IT. And so friends, we we notice here that even David himself WHEN HE SET IT OUT, GOD SENDS A MAN, anoint him, he anointed him to be what? Did he become a king immediately? No. No. And for all that time, David knew he was a king. But it didn't cause trouble in the kingdom. I know God spoke to me. I'm the next person. M so because of that inspiration you have you begin moving maneuvering that's not here but in other churches I've seen it and when you sit down this person and you ask them brother what is happen you know God spoke to me that I'm the pastor of this &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; So if he spoke to you, it means you should maneuver politically. So you are a helper of God. God doesn't need helpers. God helps himself. IF IT IS HIS SEASON AND HIS TIME FOR YOU, HE WILL OPEN THE DOOR. HALLELUJAH. Something brother of many things brother Ed Biscard taught me one stands out never forget it. He said this don't push a door open wait for God to open THE DOOR. WHEN HE OPENS THE DOOR, MATTER OF FACT, DON'T WALK THROUGH IT. RUN THROUGH HERE. [screaming] SO YOU SEE, YOU DON'T PUSH THINGS. YOU DON'T MOVE THINGS. You feel calling on my life to preach. I feel the anointed fire. But you see, brother, the problem is our pastor. He doesn't GIVE ME A CHANCE. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; IF YOU WOULD IF YOU WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME A CHANCE, you would have seen the fire falling. The problem. SO YOU BEGIN TO SEE THE PASTOR, THE MINISTERS, OUR OTHER PEOPLE AS A PROBLEM. [screaming] OH, MAY GOD GIVE US MORE DAVIDS. DAVID WAS HUMBLE. HE WAS A MAN OF [screaming] CHARACTER. HE KNEW HE WAS ANOINTED. HE KNEW HE WAS THE NEXT KING. BUT YET [screaming] HE STILL SERVED THE KING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Let me finish now. &gt;&gt; Not finish the sermon but finish the service. &gt;&gt; Probably we'll have another par. AND THE REAL TRUE CHRISTIAN, the real true believer in God, brother waits upon the Lord for these things. Wait on your ministry. Me, I have a gift of singing. Can you imagine? They call that little girl to see and they can't they don't even know what is in me and makes it matter worse someone can come I'll tell you I I'll tell you a story I've spoken so many stories haven't usually old people do that but I'm a young man I don't know why I'm telling a story one time brother Andrew one of the elders in the church where I was in Mitana years before we went to Ethiopia came to me and said uh brother the way the way me I see you and and me I'm representing many others that's how they speak I'm representing many others the way I see you are not just supposed to be a minister in the You are supposed to be a pastor. What seed was you sowing in me? And then after he said that, he began to talk about many things bad about my life. God had anointed me to stand with that man of God. And I thank God and I know he watches our services. my pastor. And I would say this, I thank God. I thank God. Not for one time have I ever fought his ministry. Yet, many times I had what you would call opportunities to fight it. But it's time I stood behind him. Why? That was the grace of God he had placed upon my life to give me that character. But character comes from God and the things which you go through in life. So whatever you are going through now is molding character. One time this brother he was so daring And I I I was so done with it. I read a quote for him, brother saying, "Stay with your person." And one time, God, the devil could anoint somebody. I read it for you last time. and he will shoot him with some poison stuff and he he he will be he will begin to move around the church maneuvering BUT STAY CLOSE TOGETHER AND STAY WITH YOUR PASTOR AND HE WILL lead you through because of God. I told his brother, "Brother, I think you are short with this poison. You are short with some poison stuff. You're poisoning my heart. I don't want to EVER HEAR THESE THINGS AGAIN. BUT IF I had not overcome that temptation, let me tell you to someone who is gifted and called of God, that's a big temptation. Brother Brian, when you are gifted and you you know you can sing maybe even better than brother Shalom, but you just see it. You think it is easy. You think I don't know. You think God doesn't know. You understand church what I'm trying to say. When you are called, you know you are called. You know your gift. But you're not given opportunity. The devil can use that. So well politically maneuvering in your heart weaken you and overthrow you. But as I finish Bam says this, wait on your ministry. If you feel a call, be sure that it's God. Be sure that it's right. Be sure that it's timely. What you are saying is timely. Your ministry is timely. Be sure and brother says one way you can be sure is to check your motives and objectives. Oh, I want to be seen. Oh, I want some money. I want motive. be led of the Holy Spirit. Don't let anything obscure that vision. Our vision is Christ. Friends, it's 120. I need to quit now. But the way I feel and the way I feel that you feel, I can preach for more than 30 minutes right now. But I just quit right now. Brother Wanga I know cannot preach for cannot interpret for more than 30 minutes right now. So I'll excuse him. Let us stand on our feet. God is God. We need him to change our heart. We need to be more humble, &gt;&gt; you know, as the musicians play. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about it and maybe if I can have more sound, brother, a little more. You know, many times we feel we have abilities to do things. You know you can do something but it's not about can do. It's about the vision of God, the person he has chosen and the right timing. But each of us is a servant. Each of us is called to serve. You're not just called to be a good church member. You're called to serve. Ask the Lord, Lord, what addition am I going to be to the body? Yes, I know I'm supporting with my attendance, [music] tithes and offerings, but what else can I do? What talent have you placed in me? We need more people who are burdened like that in the ministry. But because we we have a lot of people that are not burdened, ministry becomes heavy for it. You find men and women doing things just for the sake of that. But if you're going to be a singer, be the best. Be the best. If you're going to play instruments, minutes, give it time. Give it concentration. If you're working in the media department, don't allow the devil to maneuver in your mind and makes you make make you think that look others can do it. Well, why are you called to do it? You are the one God has called. There is a reason why God does not call many at a time. He calls one at a time. It's your season now. Tomorrow it is someone ELSE'S SEASON. BUT WHILE IT IS your season, FIND OUT, LORD, WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME TO DO? If it's the right season for you to do something for me and you fit right into it, then watch the blessing of God coming upon your life. Change my heart, oh God. Let us sing that. Change my heart, oh God. Brother Shalom, come and help me. I don't have any more sound voice to say. Make it ever true. Oh s just worship with me this morning. &gt;&gt; Change my heart, oh God.

Mold you and make you into his image, into his likeness that he may show forth of his great praise and grace. Oh, [music] what a God we serve, saints. He wants us to stay focused into the course. The vision of the word of the hour, the [music] vision for this generation. He's calling out a bride out of the church. He's calling out a bride, a people for his name. [music] And he wants us to be focused, you to be focused. But how can you do that unless he molds you and makes you into his own will? Oh yes, Lord. [music] Oh, come on, saint. Just pray.
