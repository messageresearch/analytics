[17:16] amen
[17:18] amen amen why don't we talk to our
[17:21] Bibles
[17:23] we just go to
[17:29] the Bible
[17:33] this is just going to be a continuation
[17:34] of Sunday together
[17:38] Sunday so we'll read the second
[17:43] Corinthians chapter five a recording is
[17:48] [Music]
[17:50] foreign
[18:01] [Music]
[18:23] for he has made him to be seen for us
[18:26] who knew not sin that we might be made
[18:29] the righteousness of God in him
[18:31] foreign
[18:41] [Music]
[18:44] Lord Jesus we ask you this evening to
[18:47] come back to us once again
[18:54] reveal yourself to us
[18:57] and Lord by the end of this meeting is
[19:01] May our hearts Rejoice within us looking
[19:05] because we know that you would have
[19:07] spoken to him
[19:11] in Jesus name amen
[19:17] so Jesus Paid It All
[19:20] yes
[19:21] amen Amina that's what we will speak on
[19:26] tonight once again and
[19:32] I didn't get to to finish it on Sunday
[19:37] but I trust that you will be able to get
[19:39] somewhere tonight
[19:42] I'm happy to see every one of you I want
[19:44] to say God bless you
[19:48] sir are you ready for the word tonight
[19:53] amen so
[19:57] um
[19:58] we read a lot of scriptures on Sunday
[20:00] because Sunday
[20:03] and I did not plan on Sunday to deal
[20:06] with the serpent seed although I had to
[20:07] touch it a little bit yeah
[20:14] because you see there is no way you can
[20:15] be able to talk about Sin without
[20:18] talking about the origin the original
[20:21] scene
[20:37] there's not as many sins it's only one
[20:40] sin
[20:41] [Music]
[20:42] that is unbelief of the truth
[20:46] the others are just the fruit of that
[20:49] sin
[20:49] [Music]
[20:51] so when the Bible says that man's sin
[20:54] that he says that for that
[20:57] for all have sinned I believe
[21:01] you see the sin that was done
[21:05] was what actually happened in the very
[21:09] beginning
[21:09] [Music]
[21:12] that's why the Bible says that all of us
[21:14] you each of us are born in sins
[21:20] and so sin was unbelief
[21:23] [Music]
[21:24] when Eve when when God gave adam the
[21:27] word
[21:29] Adam was Duty bound to keep that word
[21:36] you not only believe every word but to
[21:39] keep it is
[21:43] not only to believe it
[21:54] then you don't need to ask them you only
[21:56] need to look at their life
[22:00] it is your life that shows whether
[22:02] you're a Believer or not
[22:06] you see when God gave adam the word and
[22:09] he told him you see every fruit every
[22:11] tree every tree you will eat of it but
[22:13] of this one you shall not eat of it
[22:20] and then Adam
[22:23] believed and then when God left
[22:27] of course later on we know that he takes
[22:29] the woman out of the man
[22:32] and then now they become man and a woman
[22:38] and so they are together man and woman
[22:40] in the garden
[22:43] we don't see God telling Eve the word
[22:47] again
[22:50] God spoke the word once
[22:55] and then Adam was the one that now took
[22:58] it upon himself
[23:01] to teach his wife what God had said
[23:06] that's why the prophet says that a man
[23:08] is a priest in in his house
[23:13] are you hearing me this evening that
[23:16] even God will require
[23:19] your wife on your hands
[23:23] if you're married and your wife does
[23:25] something
[23:28] God will ask you you will be responsible
[23:31] before God
[23:33] but not the other way around
[23:36] what your husband does
[23:39] brother you are not going to be
[23:41] responsible
[23:42] sister I'm not going to be responsible
[23:44] before God um
[23:47] but what your husband does what your
[23:50] wife does rather
[23:52] the man is responsible and is answerable
[23:55] before God
[24:28] that's why when a sister accepts to be
[24:31] married to a man who does not believe
[24:34] the word
[24:38] she has made the greatest mistake
[24:43] because this is what is going to guide
[24:45] your life
[24:47] this is the one that's going to read
[24:49] your life
[24:51] your entire life is
[24:54] so it is very important
[24:58] notice that when Eve sinned
[25:01] when she heard from another source
[25:05] when the serpent came and gave to her
[25:08] the word
[25:10] not the word of God but the word from
[25:13] the Tree of Knowledge
[25:18] from that time
[25:20] she had an opportunity
[25:23] to turn down what the devil had spoken
[25:26] to her or
[25:28] to accept it
[25:30] that was her golden opportunity
[25:34] to accept the word or deny
[25:37] you accept the word
[25:41] but you see she lost that opportunity
[25:45] when she decided to hear from the Devils
[25:49] except what the devil said
[25:51] you see that was the scene that was done
[25:56] listen that was the original
[26:01] [Music]
[26:20] [Music]
[26:57] foreign
[27:15] their life tells what they believe
[27:19] they were they dress their friends they
[27:22] keep an association the way they talk
[27:26] you know what they hold dear to their
[27:29] souls
[27:34] these things tell what they believe
[27:38] and so we say that in Eve she went ahead
[27:43] and act from that fruit
[27:46] and you see adultery or Wednesday came
[27:50] out as a result
[27:58] was
[27:59] not known to hide before always
[28:03] she only got an idea to do it
[28:08] after she had believed what the devil
[28:10] said
[28:12] and you remember how we went through
[28:15] that on Sunday we went through up the
[28:18] process
[28:20] the legal process of the prosecution of
[28:23] an offender
[28:26] when when of course when you've seen
[28:29] when Eve transgressed also Adam came and
[28:32] took part of it
[28:35] and so they were all seen as before God
[28:40] but then you see in the following the
[28:43] laws or the legal processes
[28:51] their life was doomed
[28:54] remember I told you that you see the
[28:56] first one was his investigation of the
[28:58] crime
[29:01] when someone when an offender is going
[29:04] to be prosecuted the first thing that
[29:06] they do is to investigate on them
[29:09] [Music]
[29:11] then the second is to arrest the suspect
[29:14] foreign
[29:50] [Music]
[30:17] do you remember what the punishment was
[30:22] what was the punishment
[30:26] can somebody says
[30:32] how many were here on Sunday
[30:34] morning what was it
[30:37] death
[30:39] when Adam seen when Adam and Eve sinned
[30:42] Adam
[30:43] they were supposed to suffer the
[30:45] ultimate punishment for their sins
[30:50] because the Bible says the son of sins
[30:52] that Soul shall die
[30:59] it shall suffer the ultimate punishment
[31:05] so you see when Adam and Eve sinned
[31:09] they were supposed to suffer the
[31:12] ultimate punishment of their sins
[31:29] because all that were born after the
[31:32] manner of Adam's children were born in
[31:36] sin
[31:37] because
[32:31] [Music]
[32:37] even if it was his own son
[32:41] Adam was supposed to die
[32:44] the Judgment was already passed
[32:47] before the scene was done
[32:50] because you know even the the the the
[32:53] judge himself
[32:55] he is bound by the law
[32:58] he doesn't give judgment according to
[33:01] his soul
[33:03] judgment according to what was already
[33:06] given in the Lord
[33:09] so you see Jesus or God himself
[33:12] as the righteous
[33:15] he had to judge Adam and hold his race
[33:29] now we know that we all are from the
[33:31] lineage of Adam
[33:34] so we were all condemned today
[33:37] we are all sinners on them to death
[33:41] there is no amount of things
[33:44] that we can do that can redeem us from
[33:48] that day
[33:50] Christian Believers I want you to
[33:52] understand
[33:53] there is nothing we can do
[33:56] that is
[34:00] redeem us from that day
[34:04] that is why it had to take God himself
[34:14] that's why the devil was so happy
[34:17] because he knew that this race is
[34:19] finished
[34:20] there is no way they can be redeemed
[34:23] because according to the law
[34:26] [Music]
[34:27] the penalty for dies
[34:53] [Music]
[35:44] foreign foreign
[36:17] hallelujah amen
[36:19] so that in him we would become the
[36:23] righteousness of God
[36:27] that is we would be made acceptable to
[36:31] him
[36:33] and blessed in a right relationship with
[36:37] him
[36:39] by his gracious loving kindness
[36:44] Hallelujah man if God did not become
[36:48] amen if he did not make his son sin
[36:50] Captain
[36:54] we would have been lost forever
[36:57] that is why we are not saved because of
[37:00] our own words
[37:04] because of his work on the cross
[37:12] you will stop saying should I do this or
[37:15] should I not do that you
[37:19] will know like what Apostle Paul says
[37:22] all things are lawful unto me Amen to
[37:26] your Navy and some agenda but not all
[37:28] things are experience
[37:31] Hallelujah man there is nothing wrong
[37:33] for me to do okay
[37:35] I can't do all things and still go to
[37:37] heaven
[37:39] but I must not do all things
[37:42] because all things are defined not to
[37:45] hang up you're not to be seen by what
[37:47] I'm going to do I'm going to do such
[37:50] things that give my God my savior My
[37:53] Redeemer Glory
[37:58] that is what Grace is
[38:04] you will not even have this mentality of
[38:07] works in your head
[38:10] [Music]
[38:12] on our behalf
[38:15] investigations were made on Jesus
[38:19] yes if Jesus Paid It All for us yes
[38:23] Jesus had to go through the whole
[38:25] process
[38:28] hallelujah amen he had to go through the
[38:31] whole process
[38:32] on our behalf investigations we were
[38:36] made on Jesus
[38:39] he was arrested as a criminal yeah
[38:43] right man on our behalf he was
[38:47] prosecuted
[38:50] he was arraigned before a judge
[38:55] he was sentenced to death he said it
[38:58] will work by crucification
[39:03] he never appealed the case
[39:10] Hallelujah man he never built a case
[39:14] he accepted the Judgment
[39:17] because he knew he was
[39:33] he was doing it for somebody
[39:36] he was doing it for somebody
[39:42] he didn't care how heavy the price was
[39:46] I didn't care how heavy the sentence is
[39:51] to himself I have to bear this ultimate
[39:54] price
[39:58] because of somebody because of my own
[40:01] rest
[40:02] he became a brother
[40:05] can you imagine God himself
[40:10] so that he can be able to die for for us
[40:14] remember it had to be our brothers
[40:19] became
[41:32] amen and that is the word confuses the
[41:35] devil
[41:38] says is he their brother or is he God
[41:46] he is all of it I live here
[41:51] the beginning
[41:54] hallelujah amen that's what Jesus is
[42:11] he paid it so that we can be free
[42:15] when he paid the price
[42:17] in other words foreign
[43:17] let me ask you a question whose land is
[43:20] it
[43:22] is yours
[43:25] it is your brothers
[43:27] because now he has redeemed with his
[43:29] money
[43:32] if your brother redeems it is
[43:36] right he has a right to do with whatever
[43:41] he wants to do with it
[43:44] hallelujah amen oh glory amen when Adam
[43:49] lost
[43:50] his brother came down
[43:53] Jesus Christ yes and when he came down
[43:57] he paid the price
[43:59] he paid a price by his deaths on Calvary
[44:04] yeah
[44:04] and now whatever he paid
[44:08] belong to him let me tell you he paid
[44:12] for me I am the one he redeems
[44:17] that means what I am not a property of
[44:21] the devil anymore
[44:23] I am the property of Jesus Christ
[44:31] that the devil could not be able to say
[44:33] anything else
[44:35] when it ever brings you sickness
[44:40] to tell him
[44:42] take your hands away
[45:08] [Applause]
[45:16] if the devil takes something from you
[45:23] because the price has already been gone
[45:31] [Music]
[45:32] if the devil takes your joy away
[45:35] you have a right to claim it back
[45:40] I imagine
[45:41] Jesus on our behalf did every the whole
[45:44] he went through the whole process yes
[45:48] and we could read a lot of scriptures
[45:53] I wonder let's
[45:56] it will take a lot of time but I could
[45:58] just give you a few Snippets here and
[45:59] there
[46:00] let us let us look at a few of those
[46:03] processes as Jesus was going through
[46:04] them
[46:09] as he
[46:11] was going through the legal procedure
[46:16] let us look in the Book of Mark
[46:19] chapter 14.
[46:22] quickly now
[46:24] as he was being arrested
[46:27] Mark
[46:30] 14.3
[46:32] it says and immediately while he yet
[46:36] speak
[46:37] cometh Judas one of the twelve and with
[46:39] him a great multitude with swords and
[46:41] staves from the chief priests and the
[46:44] scribes and the elders and he that
[46:46] betrayed him and had given them a token
[46:49] saying whomsoever shall kiss that shame
[46:53] that's that same is he take him and lead
[46:56] him away safely and as soon as he was
[46:58] come he goes straight away to him and
[47:00] said master master and kissed him and
[47:03] they laid him they laid their hands on
[47:06] him and took him and one of the them
[47:08] that stood by by Drew a sword and smote
[47:12] a servant of them I priest
[47:15] and cut off his ear and Jesus answered
[47:18] and said unto them are ye come out as
[47:20] against a thief with swords and with
[47:22] steps to take me I was daily with you in
[47:25] the temple teaching and he took me not
[47:27] but the scriptures must be fulfilled and
[47:30] they all forsook him and fled and they
[47:32] followed him and he continues on and on
[47:35] and here we noticed that when they came
[47:37] to arrest Jesus
[47:40] he told them I was with you in the
[47:43] temple the whole time
[47:46] why didn't you catch me why didn't you
[47:49] arrest me today you are coming to me
[47:51] with steps and Spears and knives
[47:55] but he says all right the word must be
[47:58] fulfilled
[47:59] what was the word which was being
[48:01] fulfilled
[48:03] criminal he was being arrested it wasn't
[48:07] Jesus being arrested
[48:09] it was you being arrested
[48:13] foreign
[48:31] Matthew 26
[48:36] verses 57
[48:39] he says
[48:42] and the they that had laid hold on Jesus
[48:45] led him away to Caiaphas the high priest
[48:48] where the scribes and the elders were
[48:50] assembled
[48:52] but Peter followed him a far off under
[48:54] the high priest's Palace and went in and
[48:57] sat with the servants to to see the end
[49:00] now the chief priests and the elders and
[49:04] all the cancer sowed false witness
[49:06] against Jesus to put him to death but
[49:09] found none yeah though many false
[49:11] Witnesses came he had found they none at
[49:15] the last came to false Witnesses and we
[49:18] can go on and on and on and on but I
[49:20] want you also to look at Luke Chapter
[49:21] 22.
[49:26] you can write this down and read them
[49:28] later at your own time
[49:35] I wanted to look at Luke 22 verses 6 to
[49:39] 6. okay
[49:44] can you read in luganda
[49:51] is
[50:00] [Music]
[50:25] [Music]
[50:43] he was prosecuted as a Son of God yes
[50:52] Adam Adam the Son of God
[50:56] Jesus had to be his brother yes
[51:07] are you following me
[51:10] now I want you to see when he was being
[51:12] arraigned before a judge
[51:15] Luke 23.
[51:20] and you know I was reading one of the uh
[51:22] articles I think about a year ago
[51:27] a legal officer in a lawyer in Kenya
[51:31] Kenya who said that he was taking the
[51:36] Roman government and the Israeli
[51:38] government to court
[51:40] government
[51:44] because they prosecuted Jesus in a wrong
[51:48] way
[51:52] but they just told told them to take
[51:56] that that they they don't have
[51:58] jurisdiction to hear that case
[52:04] and so he even tried to take it in the
[52:06] in in the international court
[52:09] so they also could not file it
[52:13] but to me I think it's lack of
[52:15] understanding
[52:18] you see Jesus did everything
[52:23] even when they were Prosecuting they
[52:26] found that indeed he was not guilty
[52:29] this is
[52:31] [Music]
[52:35] look look at it in your Bible
[52:38] and the whole multitude of them arose
[52:40] and led him unto pilate and they began
[52:43] to accuse him saying we found his fellow
[52:46] we felt we found this fellow perverting
[52:49] the nation and forbidden to give tribute
[52:51] to Caesar saying that he himself is
[52:53] Christ a king and pilate asked him
[52:55] saying that without the king of the Jews
[52:58] and he answered and said thou sayest it
[53:01] then said pilate to the chief priests
[53:04] and to the people I find no fault in
[53:06] this man and they were the more fierce
[53:11] jewelry
[53:17] the beginning From Galilee to this place
[53:20] and you see when he was taken before a
[53:23] judge yes we are told
[53:26] are you hearing me Church what did the
[53:29] judge say again I find him not guilty
[53:33] see that and song
[53:35] and if you continue on from verse 6 to
[53:38] 12.
[53:40] and and and and also up to verse 25 not
[53:45] true
[53:46] you will find that the people say no
[53:50] even if he's not guilty
[53:53] we want you to crucify him
[53:57] we want you to make him guilty
[54:01] and the man washed his hands
[54:05] and he said that is
[54:11] no problem
[54:14] be a bonus
[55:12] the king told them
[55:15] foreign
[56:08] foreign
[56:29] [Music]

[57:40] to worry Choice none of your works okay

[57:48] eternal life

[57:53] one thing that had to happen
[57:57] to be free
[57:59] Jesus had to be incarcerated yes
[58:04] Jesus had to be condemned yesterday
[58:07] Jesus did it on behalf of God
[58:12] and when parabas was being set for free
[58:16] Jesus was being caught yes at that
[58:20] moment listen at that moment
[58:24] hey even if pilate wanted
[58:28] there was no way
[58:30] to release Jesus
[58:34] the moment was set free
[58:39] foreign
[59:09] [Music]
[59:10] if Jesus was not caught yes
[59:17] but Jesus died yesterday
[59:22] the action of Jesus yielding himself
[59:29] was the price
[59:34] because Jesus died on the cross
[59:37] I paid the price for your freedoms
[59:43] hallelujah amen how many believe that
[59:46] how many believe that
[59:48] Jesus paid for your freedom yes he
[59:52] died the fact that you could be free
[59:57] Hallelujah and he did it willingly
[1:00:02] anything bad of us could do
[1:00:06] was just in a napkin to what Jesus had
[1:00:09] done yeah
[1:00:13] my mind
[1:00:15] Jesus Paid It All yes

[1:04:30] door on the door knobs
[1:04:45] Hallelujah a man is leaving Egypt

[1:10:42] it happens
[1:10:45] much later
[1:10:49] you see what's going to happen first
[1:10:52] is the rapture
[1:10:56] foreign
[1:11:09] [Music]

[1:12:53] um
[1:12:59] the pride of Christ will be also a ruler
[1:13:05] he will be ruling together with Christ
[1:13:08] that will be the time
[1:13:11] which will fulfill the promise of the
[1:13:14] Messiah continuing on the throne of
[1:13:16] David
[1:13:22] would you remember when Jesus came yes
[1:13:25] and the people saw here the Jews
[1:13:28] as he was entering Jerusalem
[1:13:32] he has come as they were thinking nobody
[1:13:35] knows that it was the Messiah who had
[1:13:39] come to redeem them from the Roman
[1:13:43] Powers
[1:13:49] yes he was the one yeah
[1:13:56] they asked foreign
[1:14:34] that would be a wonderful
[1:14:39] time there will be no sickness
[1:14:44] because the Bible says
[1:14:48] during that whole time
[1:14:51] that's what the Bible says
[1:15:06] that is the time when the bride oh my
[1:15:10] God will rule but who shall We Rule
[1:15:17] that's so nice so interesting we are
[1:15:21] going to rule together
[1:15:26] when the Rapture happens
[1:15:30] there will be
[1:15:32] what we call the Armageddon after white
[1:15:37] the third world war
[1:15:39] that will destroy everything
[1:15:45] you see these things happening between
[1:15:47] Russia America China
[1:15:50] they are coming to a showdown
[1:15:54] but it will come after the bright
[1:15:56] disruptions
[1:15:59] and when they destroy everything
[1:16:04] destroys everything
[1:16:08] there will be people
[1:16:11] who think they are very intelligent
[1:16:14] they have Bankers
[1:16:18] where they can escape and even nuclear
[1:16:20] power will not destroyed
[1:16:30] and they will hide away foreign
[1:17:43] what will happen
[1:17:58] as farmers
[1:18:06] yet oh my goodness yet before the
[1:18:09] destruction of the world
[1:18:12] the way the bill gets
[1:18:17] they're the ones who could afford
[1:18:18] bankers
[1:18:23] but in that our civilization the
[1:18:29] value and they will be making fire with
[1:18:31] stones
[1:18:34] they would have gone back to Stone Age
[1:18:38] and guess who will be the Lord's over
[1:18:40] there
[1:18:43] and we shall have such powers
[1:18:48] you call us audience
[1:18:52] but actually we will not be aliens to
[1:18:56] them we shall be aliens because you
[1:18:58] would have come from the sky somewhere
[1:19:01] but indeed we shall have come from
[1:19:03] heaven but originally we are from here
[1:19:08] but they won't understand
[1:19:10] can you see why we should serve the Lord
[1:19:14] and at that time when we are in that in
[1:19:18] that in that beautiful city
[1:19:21] before we are before we say anything but
[1:19:24] when we want something
[1:19:26] before we say it shall be there I want
[1:19:31] an apple yeah
[1:19:36] foreign
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:20:13] whereas the years a thousand years
[1:20:24] the devil Satan listen
[1:20:30] the change will be put off
[1:20:35] and he'll come back to us
[1:20:39] you will start from where he is
[1:20:47] and the Bible says he he will enter into
[1:20:52] these inhabitors of the Earth
[1:20:55] [Music]
[1:21:05] and when they go like zombies
[1:21:09] to attack the city the Bible says before
[1:21:14] they even get to come close
[1:21:31] foreign
[1:22:16] you see in that Resurrection everything
[1:22:19] that ever died
[1:22:24] whether he died on mars or whether he
[1:22:26] died
[1:22:29] [Music]
[1:22:40] the bride and his room
[1:22:50] so you see where the bride is
[1:22:54] not on the other side
[1:23:02] and after everything because if you
[1:23:04] never may not go that's what the Bible
[1:23:05] says blessed day and holy is he my buddy
[1:23:09] that is not that is not part that is
[1:23:12] part rather that is part of the first
[1:23:14] resurrection
[1:23:18] because the second death
[1:23:23] will not have power over
[1:23:26] what is the second day
[1:23:28] the second death is not the death of the
[1:23:32] body Oaks
[1:23:36] is the destruction of many Souls
[1:23:41] you see we there we get another mystery
[1:23:44] from them I want to know
[1:23:46] nothing like an eternal hell
[1:24:28] do we see thereafter
[1:24:31] Empire
[1:24:41] I'm going to be there yeah
[1:24:45] hallelujah hallelujah the Bride of Jesus
[1:24:49] Christ
[1:24:50] cannot come into condemnation

[1:25:05] mother not my brethren if the world
[1:25:07] helped you
[1:25:08] then
[1:25:10] okay before I read that let me read this
[1:25:12] in John 5 24 it says very very sound to
[1:25:14] you he that here is my word
[1:25:17] and believeth on him that sent me
[1:25:21] again
[1:25:24] shall not oh my man can you say this
[1:25:28] with me and shall not and shall not come
[1:25:31] into condemnation
[1:25:34] that is
[1:25:36] now notice this is not future tense
[1:25:41] this is present continuous tense is
[1:25:58] it's already happened
[1:25:59] it has happened in the past check what
[1:26:02] the movie is helping the moment Christ
[1:26:04] died yes we have energy to count really
[1:26:07] was put into Force when you believed him
[1:26:13] we know that we have passed from death
[1:26:16] and to life to Jesus Christ
[1:26:31] that's why among the Believers we really
[1:26:34] have love for one one for the yard
[1:26:37] let me tell you I have been in another
[1:26:41] church before I believe the message
[1:26:44] but I can tell you from good authority
[1:26:48] that all over the world I've never seen
[1:26:51] a group of people that love each other
[1:26:53] more than disbelievers
[1:26:57] it doesn't matter where you go which
[1:27:01] country you find yourself

[1:27:19] will give you everything
[1:27:21] why why only because you were a Believer
[1:27:24] and the Bible says this is how we are
[1:27:27] able to know
[1:27:28] yeah pass from Death to life
[1:27:32] because we love the Brethren
[1:27:35] he that love is not his brother abides
[1:27:38] in death
[1:27:41] whosoever ahead of his brother is a
[1:27:44] murderer
[1:27:45] and as you know that no matter who has
[1:27:48] eternal life abiding in him

[1:27:55] God

[1:32:34] tribulation
[1:32:36] and of course that does not necessarily
