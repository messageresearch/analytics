the present truth is so your community is [Music] um yes that's where you read but you interpret directly well I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things and be established in the present truth all right so God bless you maybe I'm speaking uh to you this evening on the message of the hour Congress Peter writes this letter and he says this truth you already know but I'm not going to be tired I'm not going to be negligence always remind you to always put you in remembrance praise the name of the Lord I wonder if the musicians can come this side so I can be able to see them yes um it's always good for you to sit before the preacher so you can be able to look at you and you look at him dear brothers in the machine also I hope your your heart is here and you're following amen and even the brother doing the streaming you should also be following up I believe no matter what you are doing in the house of the Lord as in service you should be also part of the service praise the name of the Lord amen the president the present truth I said I will not get tired I'm all remembrance so you understand that you see the the Bible is not a new book how many Bible is the Bible is an old book of very many years but you see whenever you take this Bible and you read out of it you see something new but it doesn't mean that the Bible in itself is and I'm going to tell you this there is no truth after the Bible was written um there will be no further truth than the truth that is in the Bible are you hearing me the Bible is a book of and so it is taken to be a holy book [Music] will always have his faith and basis of teaching on the Bible we are not listen we are not going to have further truth or more truth beyond the Bible for this is the absolute yes there is no father there is no more Truth for the Bible is the ultimate and absolute truth God will continue to send prophets in every generation every time he will send prophets he will send preachers he will send men women who will have father revelation of God to their people he's a false teachings and I want to say God loved the world Hallelujah [Music] [Music] to restore the church foreign Apostolic Church foreign the foundation foreign one time someone came to brother Branham and he said the way of senior Ministry you have a deeper understanding of the Bible and also the angel of the Lord has visited and also you have a lot of Revelations and so you have all the qualifications [Music] that you should now write a third Testament again so that we can complement this one but what did [Music] and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] not be to take back his people through the foundations of the Bible that's why we quote his message that's why we keep saying that the prophet says because if he's a prophet he cannot say anything against the Bible I mean hallelujah amen he will always say yeah yeah what the Bible says what the other side when Paul came on the scene I never preach something different he preached what Peter prayer Paul was not there when Jesus was on Earth Paul was not a Believer at that time but when Peter Pentacles in the name of Jesus Christ a long long time Jesus Christ yes the same truth and what did he tell them he said John yokana baptized unto repentance introducing Jesus Christ and the Bible says they wanted to know what name is the same spirit that Peter was to shout out said repentance the Bible says in the name of Jesus Christ Same Spirit If any man today um foreign [Applause] of restoration [Applause] is going to come out of all the religions those ones are more about Sweden than the Catholics why because this message the preaching of the Bible and what does the bible tell us some demons there are some things which cannot go away yes so if your new message because they have received so much knowledge of the message they can now not Kathy pray for the sick baby religion let me tell you they have missed it in the teaching of the Bible is in the Bible that our Prophet told us he told us Divine heal yeah foreign I had my I have my daughter here she she come on come run quickly or without shoes just come around here where is she I can't see oh she's sleeping okay for animals [Music] and her sister Elizabeth they love dogs and so they wanted a dog and so they got a dog that dog you see a German shepherd friendly dog um but we prayed for her she now plays with the dog set you free they shall speak in the chat foreign amen but what do we have something else something else that is not what we see in the scriptures a man or anything with two heads he doesn't know how to go God never did have two heads of to his church he always dealt in every generation as we've studied through the scriptures there is always because you get two men you got two opinions and it's got to come to one final absolute and our Prophet says is the word is the Bible the Bible Crystal foreign foreign foreign praise the name of the Lord I said praise the name of the Lord that's the prophet I want to believe not a prophet who claims that his words are checked by the Bible because in other words he's taking you back I am not a Vindicated Prophet over generation and sometimes they find people who claim to take a scripture and take the the quotes because the Bible says this year was not giving his you find people who say women should not play their hair in the Bible and when you stood up but here's what I'm saying on the matter and he gave Divine interpretation to that scripture we are talking what the Bible says if you're taking the what the Bible says without Revelation the Bible said to all of us believe let him be baptized somebody who is baptizing people like that things what the Bible says here comes yes it is the name of the Father the same name of the sun it is the Lord Jesus Christ he just gave you divine interpretation not his opinions I'm not following an opinion demand I'm following a man that is the Revelation I find them you know restricting sisters [Applause] and that's exactly what the Bible says and even when it comes to men foreign foreign [Applause] it's going to be a problem for them foreign [Music] Hallelujah God bless you may have you you may stand up [Applause] which I'll add on that we shall add on that is speaking of the messages foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] can you can you do this worship for me brother [Music] Hallelujah praise
