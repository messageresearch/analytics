[27:40] Philipp
[27:56] pH
[28:26] for
[28:56] e
[29:26] for
[29:48] [Music]
[29:56] pH
[30:26] for
[30:46] [Music]
[30:56] for
[31:05] so
[31:17] uh was traveling to the US for some
[31:26] time
[31:28] we will try to find a contact for you so
[31:30] that you can get some Believers
[31:34] there one thing I love about the message
[31:37] is you know it's scatter all over the
[31:42] world even in places where there are no
[31:44] churches you will at least find some
[31:45] Believers where where you can fellowship
[31:47] with
[31:52] them praise God so tonight I'm just
[31:55] sharing uh with you is that okay now is
[31:59] it fine Brother
[32:02] Isaac I was told that my microphone was
[32:06] muted so I just wanted to be sure that
[32:08] everybody can hear yeah it's fine okay
[32:11] so I'm speaking on press on toward the
[32:21] goal uh toward the goal I mean
[32:26] not no just say what I'm saying press on
[32:30] toward the
[32:33] goal yes tell your neighbor press on
[32:36] toward the
[32:39] go nice to see you sister Esther I
[32:42] know you went through some things but I
[32:45] want to tell you tonight press on my
[32:48] sister press on amen that's just all I
[32:52] have to say
[32:54] tonight we are going to read from the
[32:57] Amplified
[33:00] version and see from verse
[33:04] S I will just read it directly and my
[33:07] brother will interpret directly from me
[33:08] here
[33:09] amen but whatever former things were
[33:12] gained to
[33:16] me that were gain
[33:21] me as I thought
[33:23] [Music]
[33:25] then this things once regarded as
[33:29] advancement in
[33:34] Merit I have come to consider as
[33:41] loss absolutely
[33:44] [Music]
[33:45] worthless for the sake of
[33:49] Christ and the purpose which he has
[33:52] given my
[33:55] life a purpose which God has given our
[34:00] life before we came to
[34:02] Christ before we came to the
[34:05] message we had things we thought were
[34:09] gain we had things which we thought were
[34:12] of
[34:14] value we regarded them as advancements
[34:17] in
[34:20] marriage but then Paul here to the
[34:22] Philippians he writes to them and he
[34:24] gives a
[34:25] testimony
[34:27] and I I trust it can be our testimony
[34:30] tonight each of
[34:32] us I have come to consider those things
[34:35] as
[34:39] loss absolutely
[34:42] worthless for the sake of Christ meaning
[34:46] Christ is greater than all the things
[34:49] that you thought were of
[34:53] value if you if you believe Jesus Christ
[34:58] but there is something of value more
[35:00] than
[35:03] him then you've not yet believed on him
[35:07] perfectly you should come to that level
[35:10] of your
[35:11] life where everything else is
[35:17] worthless for the sake of
[35:19] Christ and this purpose which he has
[35:22] given in your
[35:25] life you believe
[35:27] Jesus you receive a new
[35:30] purpose I see sister doas
[35:34] tonight you wanted to be a nun I don't
[35:37] know whether you still remember that she
[35:39] wanted to be a
[35:42] nun and she even went
[35:45] there how long did you
[35:48] study one
[35:50] year so this one was a n in
[35:54] [Music]
[35:55] making but one day the message came her
[35:59] way and she put all that behind
[36:03] her became
[36:05] worthless for the treasure she had
[36:09] found I believe every believer should be
[36:11] that
[36:13] way why is it hard for people to believe
[36:16] a Christian
[36:19] life because many when they come to
[36:22] Christ they still do not treasure him
[36:27] they don't see him as a
[36:29] treasure they see him as an
[36:32] option they see him as a something good
[36:34] in their life but they have other things
[36:36] are
[36:39] important for me when I received this
[36:42] message I accepted Christ in my
[36:45] heart everything else became
[36:48] worthless everything became
[36:51] worthless he is the only thing of
[36:54] value everything else comes after
[36:59] praise God praise God I have a hierarchy
[37:02] in my
[37:04] life number one Jesus Christ that one is
[37:09] number
[37:11] one my wife cannot take that
[37:14] place my children cannot take that place
[37:18] nobody can take that
[37:19] place Jesus Christ Tak the First
[37:23] Priority
[37:25] One relationship with
[37:28] him number two my wife my mother can't
[37:33] even take that
[37:35] place my wife is number two after
[37:40] Christ not even my
[37:43] children she's number
[37:45] two why because brother bam tells us
[37:49] that is the second best thing after
[37:55] salvation if you're married your spouse
[37:58] must be number
[38:01] two if you value
[38:04] something more than
[38:06] that which is not Christ you have a
[38:10] problem in your
[38:12] marriage and you need
[38:15] counseling but I believe all of you who
[38:18] are married
[38:20] here number one
[38:22] God number
[38:24] two your wife
[38:27] your
[38:28] husband and then number three can be
[38:31] your
[38:32] children your family and and and and
[38:35] then everything else comes
[38:37] after for me number four is
[38:42] Ministry Pastor you you put your family
[38:46] and your wife above
[38:49] Ministry Ministry is not
[38:54] salvation Christ is number one
[38:57] but Christ is not
[39:00] Ministry you find very many pastors and
[39:03] preachers they lose their
[39:06] family in the process of doing
[39:09] Ministry I believe that Ministry cannot
[39:13] replace
[39:15] family and family cannot replace
[39:18] Ministry has their
[39:20] place before I go to
[39:23] preach before I go for a missionary trip
[39:27] I have to make sure that my wife and my
[39:29] children have something to
[39:33] eat even if I come here on the
[39:36] pulpit and I'm preaching a very good
[39:39] sermon if I had if I had displeased my
[39:42] wife at
[39:44] home and you know slapped All My
[39:47] Children before
[39:49] I I'm really wasting
[39:52] time because I have not been good at
[39:55] home
[39:57] what does the scripture
[39:59] say can you go with me to the book of
[40:01] First
[40:03] Timothy this is not even part of what I
[40:05] wanted to preach
[40:08] about that verse brought it let us go
[40:12] through that chapter chapter
[40:18] three he says this is a truth saying if
[40:21] a man desire the the office of a bishop
[40:23] he desires a good
[40:25] work
[40:28] [Music]
[40:29] Bishop then must be blameless the
[40:31] husband of one
[40:35] wife so you see a bishop or a pastor
[40:38] cannot have more than one
[40:41] wife must have one
[40:43] wife Vigilant sober of good behavior
[40:46] given to hospitality able to
[40:55] teach
[40:56] not given to Wine Not Striker not greedy
[41:00] or filthy lacker but patient not a Brer
[41:03] not
[41:08] [Music]
[41:11] cous one that ruleth well his own
[41:16] house having his children in subjection
[41:19] with all
[41:23] gravity and then he says if a man know
[41:25] not how to rule his own
[41:30] house how shall he take care of the
[41:33] Church of
[41:35] God and so he's a Deon
[41:38] also and so he's a Deon same
[41:40] thingification
[41:42] you see it says if a man does not know
[41:45] how to rule his own
[41:47] house if he does not know how to put his
[41:50] house in
[41:52] order how can he take care of the Church
[41:55] of the Liv
[41:57] he even says in some other
[41:59] place if a man cannot you
[42:04] know take care of his
[42:07] home is worse than
[42:10] unid meaning he not a
[42:13] Believer so you see it's not only for a
[42:15] Believer for a Preacher
[42:17] Brother for every brother every
[42:21] man you must be able to take care of
[42:23] your
[42:24] family must love them you must be able
[42:28] to cherish them and and and so that's
[42:31] the same way
[42:32] God God is our father amen he takes us
[42:36] as
[42:37] priority and he wants to take care of us
[42:41] he wants to nourish us he loves us
[42:43] beyond anything else he loves us even
[42:46] more than
[42:48] angels He Loves Us more than
[42:51] Heaven he left heaven and he came down
[42:53] to the
[42:55] Earth could he do that if heaven was
[42:58] more important to him than
[43:02] us you are more important to
[43:06] God
[43:08] is more important to
[43:11] God all Angels
[43:14] combined when the Angels
[43:17] sinned just looked at them and he said
[43:20] you go never come
[43:22] back but when man
[43:25] sin God
[43:28] himself come down to redeem foreign
[43:33] man that shows you how important you are
[43:35] to
[43:37] God God loves
[43:39] family family to God is
[43:43] priority and that is why if your family
[43:46] is broken in any
[43:48] way God is more willing to help you put
[43:51] it together than you are
[43:54] willing praise God and and so you you
[43:58] men who are not married you women who
[44:00] are not yet
[44:02] married God is interested in you having
[44:07] family because God is a family
[44:10] man can you say Amen to that God is a
[44:13] family
[44:14] man God is not a
[44:19] bachelor God is not a
[44:21] bachelor God is a married man and I am
[44:24] his wife the church is his wife the
[44:28] Bible says he's the head and we the
[44:31] church are the
[44:32] body so God is a married man and he has
[44:35] children too we are his children oh
[44:39] Hallelujah hallu glory to God we are his
[44:43] wife we are his children he's our
[44:47] husband is our father is everything to
[44:51] us we are everything to
[44:54] him Hallelujah
[44:56] relationship what a
[44:59] connection and we have a
[45:01] goal our goal is to go and be with
[45:06] him the god
[45:08] of
[45:11] married is to go and be with a
[45:14] husband the the go that the church
[45:17] has is to go and be with the
[45:20] Lord oh our hearts are longing to be
[45:23] with the
[45:24] Lord
[45:26] goal our goal is not to be
[45:29] millionaires Al that is good our goal is
[45:33] not to to wear all the clothes in the
[45:37] world although that is good our goal is
[45:40] not to be to have Masters and phds and
[45:43] everything every education educational

[47:02] Catholicism it can listen it can't be
[47:05] completed under
[47:06] [Applause]
[47:08] theology God had to send a
[47:11] prophet he said in the days of the voice
[47:13] of the seventh
[47:15] angel when he begins to sound the
[47:19] mystery the mystery what mystery not
[47:23] only the mystery of Christ
[47:26] but the mystery of the bridegroom and
[47:28] and the
[47:30] bride the mystery of that
[47:33] Union will be
[47:35] finished Hallelujah when you read the
[47:38] Bible from Genesis
[47:41] Revelation it's all about that
[47:45] relationship between Jesus and his
[47:48] church read Song of
[47:51] Solomon is all about that
[47:53] relationship read about the book of
[47:57] it's all about that relationship read
[47:59] Ruth same thing go to the New Testament
[48:03] the whole thing is talking about two
[48:07] people Jesus and you Jesus and I
[48:12] Hallelujah I cannot wait to be perfectly
[48:15] joined with
[48:19] him and Paul says I may not have fully
[48:23] been I may not have fully achieved that
[48:28] but I'm
[48:29] pressing I'm continuing on I am not
[48:33] going to give up I am not going to let
[48:36] go I'm going to continue
[48:39] blessing until I'm fully United with
[48:42] him Hallelujah let us not let
[48:47] anything us or discourage
[48:50] us we must be fully United with
[48:53] him we must amen the Church must become
[48:56] one with the Lord
[48:59] Jesus nothing can stop
[49:01] it amen Paul said what can separate
[49:05] me from the love of Jesus the Bible is
[49:09] all about
[49:10] love if you want or you love a love
[49:14] story this is a love
[49:16] story it's between you and Jesus is
[49:20] between me and Jesus this is a love
[49:23] letter and that's why sent a
[49:26] prophet the way people who are in
[49:29] love they send
[49:32] Messengers to go and say and take a
[49:36] letter oh take this
[49:38] letter to that
[49:41] girl just don't make sure you don't open
[49:44] it tell her I love her and then he
[49:48] brings that letter this one is just a
[49:51] messenger but the the real thing is
[49:55] about him and
[49:58] her those are in
[50:01] love those are coming into
[50:03] unity and in the same way when God sends
[50:07] a messenger the messenger is only a
[50:10] messenger with a
[50:12] letter his message is a
[50:15] letter and we have received a
[50:17] letter amen invting us with Jesus Christ
[50:22] whenever we read in the message whenever
[50:24] we hear the message what do we see we
[50:28] see more about
[50:30] ourselves and we see more about
[50:33] him it is a two
[50:37] way you know when when when when you are
[50:40] writing writing a

[59:06] unequal for his
[59:08] sake I have lost

[59:19] Christ and may be found in him believing
[59:23] and relying on him
[59:25] [Music]
[59:28] not having any righteousness of my own
[59:31] derived from my obedience to the
[59:33] [Music]
[59:37] law and its

[59:45] righteousness which comes through
[59:49] faith in Christ
[59:51] Jesus listen friends
[59:56] your
[59:57] righteousness should be
[59:59] genuine it should not be coming from OB
[1:00:02] obeying the
[1:00:05] law it should
[1:00:08] come
[1:00:11] from the faith in
[1:00:14] Christ your righteousness should be on
[1:00:16] the basis of
[1:00:20] Faith what did Abraham do Abraham
[1:00:24] believed
[1:00:25] God and was counted to him for
[1:00:29] righte what did my wife
[1:00:31] do my wife believed everything I told
[1:00:34] her and I counted her worthy for my
[1:00:37] being my
[1:00:39] wife so in the same way Jesus
[1:00:41] Christ wants to count us
[1:00:45] worthy not because we have done not on
[1:00:48] the basis of our good works which we
[1:00:49] have

[1:07:02] here you are you are you know um um what
[1:07:08] is this word that I we used last
[1:07:11] time who remembers that
[1:07:17] word like a
[1:07:22] priz

[1:07:35] I am I'm here all the demons we always
[1:07:38] want to say all the demons are under
[1:07:41] me yeah but Paul is saying I'm saying
[1:07:47] that in
[1:07:48] reality it is not what is
[1:07:51] here but showing is showing us how to
[1:07:54] attain
[1:07:56] it before I continue here I'm showing
[1:07:59] you that we a trophy of his
[1:08:05] grace you know a trophy is attained only
[1:08:08] after
[1:08:11] Victory the one who runs the
[1:08:14] race or the one who fights the
[1:08:16] battle is the one who gets the trophy
[1:08:19] later
[1:08:20] on and when he gets the
[1:08:22] trophy the trophy
[1:08:24] shows he's
[1:08:26] Victorious are you following me no one
[1:08:29] can debate with
[1:08:32] him when David went when David when Saul
[1:08:35] told
[1:08:36] David to go and kill the the
[1:08:39] Philistines and that whoever does that I
[1:08:42] don't know how many heads did he want
[1:08:43] was it
[1:08:45] 100 he said when you do that when you
[1:08:49] kill them you can take my wife my
[1:08:52] daughter rather
[1:08:54] I'll give you my daughter he thought
[1:08:58] that David would be able to do
[1:09:00] it but David was a type of
[1:09:04] Christ David went and he fought with
[1:09:08] those people and he killed them and he
[1:09:12] cut off their head put it in the
[1:09:15] socks and cuted it
[1:09:18] trophies of his
[1:09:21] victory and he brought it over to the
[1:09:23] king
[1:09:25] he says open and
[1:09:27] see the man couldn't add any
[1:09:30] more said my daughter is there you
[1:09:34] can Jesus Christ oh hallelujah
[1:09:38] hallelujah in the same way he came down
[1:09:41] here on Earth he took the
[1:09:44] devil and he finished him he finished
[1:09:49] him I said he finished him when he was
[1:09:52] on the cross he said it is
[1:09:56] finished hallelujah hallelujah and what
[1:09:59] was the what proved that he is
[1:10:03] finished because when he finished the
[1:10:06] devil we are the ones that he had to
[1:10:10] show for
[1:10:13] R you did not get it yet we are the
[1:10:18] ones that he has to show for
[1:10:21] it because if he not come if they had
[1:10:25] not died we would have still been in
[1:10:29] sin actually we would have died but he
[1:10:34] died in our state so which devil did he
[1:10:39] defeat he defeated
[1:10:41] death and after he defeated death he
[1:10:45] came to us hallelujah and he pointed to
[1:10:48] us and he said you are the
[1:10:51] reason you are the proof
[1:10:54] that I'm a Victor because you are still
[1:10:57] alive it shows I'm a
[1:11:00] Victor because you are still alive shows
[1:11:03] I'm a conqueror and I'm telling you we
[1:11:06] are not dying anytime
[1:11:08] soon because Jesus died in our
[1:11:11] St he died that we might have life he
[1:11:15] died that we might be
[1:11:17] victorious therefore whether devil likes
[1:11:19] it or
[1:11:20] not we must come into
[1:11:25] Perfection Perfection must
[1:11:28] come if we can't come there it will come
[1:11:31] to
[1:11:34] us but I must be
[1:11:36] perfected I must be in the image of
[1:11:39] Christ the flesh Must Die my desires
[1:11:43] Must Die My Mind Must Die Christ must be
[1:11:48] bor in
[1:11:50] me and he says Press On

[1:11:56] it but it shows you how to
[1:12:00] press praise God he says actively press

[1:20:30] him in the
[1:20:32] Rapture to leave as Overcomers in this
[1:20:35] world we must not settle for anything
[1:20:40] less listen listen if you have not
[1:20:44] overcome some
[1:20:46] things for example we are in Africa we
[1:20:50] in Uganda we have a common problem
[1:20:54] lack of
[1:20:56] resources lack of
[1:20:59] money you know people and but before I
[1:21:02] talk about that I'll tell you this many
[1:21:05] times when people get money they go away
[1:21:07] from
[1:21:09] God many times it is seen when people
[1:21:12] get money they go out from
[1:21:14] God is one of the richest
[1:21:17] Generations but he see they have done
[1:21:19] too little for
[1:21:21] God and so the more resources people get
[1:21:25] the more they forget God sometimes they
[1:21:28] think it is a good thing to be
[1:21:30] poor but I don't want to be poor because
[1:21:34] when I get money I will use it to serve
[1:21:36] God what about you will you serve God If
[1:21:41] He blesses
[1:21:43] you you are quiet only a few of you
[1:21:46] saying amen do you fear money some of
[1:21:48] you fear
[1:21:49] money let me tell you in Africa here
[1:21:53] some people fear you give someone

[1:22:25] your

[1:22:38] there and you want God to give you 1
[1:22:41] million you must have big
[1:22:43] Faith big Faith doesn't look to small

[1:23:20] rich believers who are very rich
[1:23:23] you see they have done so much for God
[1:23:26] which means God God saw their

[1:23:34] here and you want to be blessed
[1:23:37] financially first I'm giving you now a
[1:23:39] clue first check your

[1:23:53] God is about to bless
[1:23:56] financially not you are not among them
[1:23:59] until your
[1:24:03] vision is aligned with that of
[1:24:07] God now if you you check yourself and
[1:24:10] you noce your
[1:24:12] objective your
[1:24:14] goal your
[1:24:17] motive what is it oh we are preaching
[1:24:20] that our goal is is to go in the Rapture
[1:24:22] our go is Ser to do things for God
[1:24:26] everything else doesn't
[1:24:29] matter that is our goal it should
[1:24:32] consume
[1:24:33] us whatever we do should be under that
[1:24:36] but our main goal is
[1:24:39] that if God sees that that is your
[1:24:42] go oh take me at my words
[1:24:46] tonight God wants to bless you
[1:24:50] financially and he will
[1:24:53] the devil can't stop

[1:25:44] woman who you know the prophet
[1:25:47] told go and bring whatever you can bring
[1:25:59] bring elishah was the prophet and the
[1:26:03] prophet of God told that woman come on

[1:26:11] find and know she was poor she didn't
[1:26:14] have enough when she went out she
[1:26:18] borrowed as much as
[1:26:21] she to her
[1:26:23] strength and whatever she
[1:26:26] brought the prophet of God filled with
[1:26:29] o told her now go and
[1:26:31] S where did that business come from from
[1:26:36] God that's what God is going to do for
[1:26:39] you praise God hallelujah hallu you can
[1:26:44] think about me what you want to think
[1:26:45] about me but I believe when God speaks
[1:26:50] he has to accomplish what
[1:26:54] [Music]
[1:26:55] hallelujah hallelujah God wants us to be
[1:27:00] Overcomers not
[1:27:02] defeated to take he wants to you know to

[1:27:07] our
[1:27:09] place Sons and Daughters of God and live
[1:27:12] above the world he doesn't want us to
[1:27:15] live in sin so if you're living in sin
[1:27:18] listen to me God is Will for you to live
[1:27:22] above that
[1:27:24] se so don't focus on
[1:27:27] that put it behind you look

[1:27:39] us if we know our go we will not give
[1:27:44] up right we will keep pressing on we
[1:27:48] will settle we will not settle for less
[1:27:55] brother Edson we will not set
[1:27:58] for we will not do I have someone here
[1:28:02] who will repeat with me will not setle
[1:28:03] for
[1:28:04] Less we will not setle for
[1:28:07] Less our goal is the
[1:28:10] rapture we need to know we canot go
[1:28:12] there
[1:28:13] alone the very last one must come in
[1:28:17] first whatever we do whatever we do we
[1:28:22] be further that goal of the
[1:28:26] Rapture if we are collecting money for
[1:28:28] the
[1:28:29] church to buy land and to build the
[1:28:32] church it is to further the
[1:28:35] Rapture to help the Rapture come quickly
[1:28:38] right if you're going for missionary
[1:28:40] work it is for that go if we preparing
[1:28:44] youth
[1:28:45] meetings what is the goal what is the
[1:28:48] purpose to F the
[1:28:50] Rapture because the young people come in
[1:28:54] they will be prepared by the ministry
[1:28:56] which will come they preure them with
[1:29:00] without the Holy Ghost They will receive
[1:29:02] the Holy Ghost amen those who need God
[1:29:05] to move in their lives a certain
[1:29:07] way God will move for what God to father
[1:29:12] to bring about the
[1:29:15] Rapture if we are printing books and
[1:29:18] distributing
[1:29:19] drugs you've done that
[1:29:23] andon Solomon
[1:29:25] and you done that for what go to end for
[1:29:30] the
[1:29:31] Rapture for the that is our goal that I
[1:29:35] said that is our goal that's why we
[1:29:37] intentionally do certain things in a
[1:29:39] certain
[1:29:43] way that's why we get we Mar our young
[1:29:49] people when
[1:29:52] so that we don't want them to
[1:29:54] concentrate on the body feelings and
[1:29:58] this that is nothing for the world we
[1:30:03] want them to focus on the
[1:30:05] Rapture to focus on the
[1:30:08] go if if you are married you become more
[1:30:13] stable I remember my brother here who is
[1:30:16] also my son in the
[1:30:19] Lord he was beginning to go sideway
[1:30:22] and I was praying for him oh God oh God
[1:30:27] give him a wifee him and now he's
[1:30:30] becoming
[1:30:31] stable because of a family God is a
[1:30:34] family
[1:30:35] man in your mind is a young person think
[1:30:39] about settling
[1:30:40] down in that area of your life and then
[1:30:43] you focus on the
[1:30:46] go praise God praise God that's why I
[1:30:52] come to
[1:30:53] church that is why we believe in working
[1:30:57] we encourage working not
[1:31:00] being because if you lazy you don't you
[1:31:03] cannot focus on the
[1:31:07] God everything that we do it should help
[1:31:11] us to keep straight our eyes straight on
[1:31:14] the
[1:31:16] ground are you hearing me
[1:31:18] now our Prophet says this
[1:31:22] I've often
[1:31:24] wondered what does christians want to
[1:31:26] frustrate themselves with the things
[1:31:29] anyhow men and women comes to me many
[1:31:32] times and says in their confessions and
[1:31:34] so forth when I have I have those in
[1:31:35] private interviews and they meet me and
[1:31:37] move make confessions of living immoral
[1:31:39] and all
[1:31:46] kinds because they can't deny the holy
[1:31:49] spirit is right
[1:31:50] there and if they cover if they have to
[1:31:53] cover it up it brings it right out for
[1:31:56] them so they might as well tell
[1:32:00] it if they get to try get out the Holy
[1:32:03] Spirit stops them say just a minute here
[1:32:04] is certain thing and certain thing
[1:32:09] and and that has happened Even in our
[1:32:12] church
[1:32:13] here where people would try to deny
[1:32:15] things and the Holy Spirit Will point it
[1:32:18] out so when they come they begin to tell
[1:32:20] me about the things of the
[1:32:23] world and I notice it is amongest
[1:32:27] Believers you are going
[1:32:30] somewhere what are you drifting
[1:32:33] for get some ambition about
[1:32:36] you set your goal on
[1:32:39] Christ and quit with the
[1:32:44] world Amen that is our
[1:32:47] goal we should set our goal on Christ
[1:32:53] and we should quit telling with the
[1:32:55] world here and there and
[1:32:58] there and you must test your motive and
[1:33:03] objective and find the will of
[1:33:07] God and then find your
[1:33:10] objective and then test your
[1:33:13] motive and see if your motive is
[1:33:16] right and then as Jesus said in Mark
[1:33:20] 11 say to this
[1:33:23] mountain that is if your objective is
[1:33:25] right your motive is right
[1:33:28] and if you s to this
[1:33:31] mountain be
[1:33:33] moved and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:33:37] as long as you got that in the
[1:33:39] heart whether it's the will of God or
[1:33:42] not or your motive or objective is
[1:33:45] wrong how is it going to move and your
[1:33:48] objective is
[1:33:50] right but when you know what your motive
[1:33:53] is
[1:33:54] right and it's the will of God and your
[1:33:58] objective is
[1:33:59] right it has
[1:34:04] got are you
[1:34:07] hearing oh
[1:34:09] God I I want to contribute to the church
[1:34:12] land
[1:34:15] fund God will ask you how
[1:34:18] much I bless you how much will you give
[1:34:22] uh 1
[1:34:23] million and then God will bless you with
[1:34:26] 500,000 because he knows even if he
[1:34:28] gives you 50
[1:34:30] million you will not give the one
[1:34:34] million first of all you limited
[1:34:37] God you very well know we need about 300
[1:34:42] million and then you you are saying God
[1:34:44] I'll give 1
[1:34:48] million what is your motive so if if you
[1:34:51] promise God 1
[1:34:53] million in church land
[1:34:56] fund and he gives you
[1:34:59] 50 where 50 million where will you put
[1:35:03] the
[1:35:05] 49 it is even likely you may not
[1:35:08] TI you a lot of
[1:35:14] money I'm challenging you tonight I'm
[1:35:17] teaching you how to be
[1:35:20] blessed but if you want God to bless you
[1:35:23] don't just say it on your heart on your
[1:35:25] mouth minute in your heart pray about it
[1:35:29] your motive is right your objective is
[1:35:30] right oh God if you bless me I'm sure
[1:35:34] going to give a substantive
[1:35:37] amount towards the the the the church
[1:35:40] project of building the church I'm going
[1:35:43] to send I'm going to send missionaries
[1:35:45] into the
[1:35:47] field I'm going to do this for your
[1:35:50] work if God sees that
[1:35:53] heart he would
[1:35:56] say even if you've not prayed that much
[1:36:00] but he is the motive the objective he'll
[1:36:03] bless you with the
[1:36:04] money and then someone who has been
[1:36:06] fasting and
[1:36:07] praying for days and
[1:36:11] nights is not
[1:36:15] fair I prayed a lot I fasted a
[1:36:19] lot the question is what is your
