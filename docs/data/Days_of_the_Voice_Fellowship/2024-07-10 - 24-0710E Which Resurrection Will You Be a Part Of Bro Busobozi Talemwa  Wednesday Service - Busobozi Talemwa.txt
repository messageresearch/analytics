whoever else will hear what we going to share may your presence fill our hearts name amen amen shall we please turn to our Bibles oh Hallelujah the Book of John chapter 5 our brother Deon Enoch um had a loss in in his wife's family and so he Tred for uh so in uh feel free to please um check call him and you [Music] know I think he back today or tomorrow amen we just reading the book of John chapter 5u John 5 2 Mar not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth we reading John 528 John 5:28 okay I'll read it again Mar not at this at this for the hour is coming in the the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation I can of mine own self do nothing as I hear I judge and my judgment is just because I seek not mine own will but the will of the Father which has sent me [Music] [Music] amen be seated may the Lord bless you tonight how many I expecting to hear from the Lord tonight I'm going to request the brothers sisters who are this that I can be able Amen to see all of you very well ah I'm happy uh to see my sister Ruth making it tonight God bless you I've been praying for you amen so um we I'm having some I will call it a significant message I want to share with with the church tonight hell this week you know usually I share different parts of scripture with different young people throughout the week I usually do so but sometimes most times I I I get inspired to elaborate it more in the [Music] service so there's this one that asked me uh I think it was brother Dixon yeah asked me about the resurrection asking me um different details regarding the Rapture and and um you know how many raptures are we going to have how many resurrections are we going to have and you know different things pertaining to each of those I answered him but tonight I want to maybe go a little bit further and expound also share a few things from the message and what I'm sharing on tonight is which Resurrection will you be a part of so you see here in John chapter 5 um Jesus is speaking and it appears he's talking of two two different resurrections but as a matter of fact this is the same Resurrection which we call the second Resurrection as we shall see later because in this Resurrection we see that there are those going to be judged and there are those who of course who are going to be judged unto damnation condemnation and those who will be given life so when we talk about this resurrection that the Bible is speaking of in John 5 that has nothing to do with a [Music] bride and as a matter of fact uh if you read um we'll begin with u Revelation 20 if you have time you please go and read the whole chapter of Revelations very interesting chapter it speaks of what is going to happen especially beginning with the Millennium or beginning with the uh after the Rapture because here is the order of events these are prophetic events that are the Bible speaks of whether you are conscious about it or not whether people believe it or not these are things that are going to happen the Bible has um talked about these things very openly and God has sent his servant William Bram in this end time to expound it for us to be able to understand and to be able to place these events in their timeline so and the while events are moving on people either know these things or they don't know some know but they behave as if they don't know I would not want us to behave as if we do not know because these things are going to happen and to those who knew and they found in a crossroad and they are found on the wrong side of the road they would be the most miserable because they would have known everything but they would have missed out on the opportunity to be on the right side so we see that as long as man is still having life on Earth living because Jesus Christ himself comes back again to the Earth we actually sing that song and we says that the Lord is coming back to Earth again the Lord is coming back to Earth again Satan will be bound a thousand years and we will have no tempter then after Jesus shall come back to now you know there we are or rather we are singing about the Millennium because you know when Jesus comes back again the Bible says he came riding on a white horse and he was riding behind him were thousands thousands of his Saints and you know those are they that had already gone in the Rapture before they will be the ones to come back down with him and together with him set up a kingdom in this world we shall never be defeated by any [Music] man and he will be the king of kings truly now physically right right now he is spiritually the King of Kings right now he's ruling spiritually but then he will rule even physically on Earth he will have actually a physical headquarters on earth oh praise the name of the Lord on the city man Zion amen he would set up his headquarters he will set up his kingdom and he will rule out of there he will rule the whole world there will be those who would be the uh the um should I call it the remnants of the of the old world and those will be ruled actually the Bible says they will multiply as the sand of sea so quickly there will be so many they will fill the whole world but during the whole time there will be no sin there will be no fornication there will be no adultery there will be no Ste or no thieves there will be no drinking and getting drunk there will be no drug abuse you know why because aen Jesus himself amen will be the king of the earth not only that the devil will be bound for the whole time because there is no way Jesus can rule in the world when the devil is still also ruling in the [Music] world right now the devil is ruling right now it is Satan Isen right now it is so difficult for us to serve God because you know we we have forces coming against us day by day forces coming our mind even now as we are preaching you know forces are attacking mind you're it is here we are just over fighting with it every day and some you know you know give up others give up and go but but you know but some of us stay Hallelujah and on suay said we are not of those that draw back we are not of those that draw back we are of those that press on God Amen and we know that you know the devil will be bound a thousand years and there will be no temp then there will be no sin then there will be no you know power of Darkness there Satan will be bound in Chains and he will be in the bottomless pit and during that time we the bride shall be ruling with Christ out of the city and we shall rule the whole world hallu I cannot wait for that time and then after that comes the white Throne judgment after the uh the the the Millennium this is when this scripture of John 5 28 to 29 is going to be fulfilled you know he says Mar not at this for the hour is coming in the which all everybody say all did you see that brother which verse is that not at this for the hour is coming in the which all not PS but all all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and they shall come forth that hour is coming how many believe this scripture that time is coming that day is coming all the rich and the poor The Young and the old the women and the men the black and the white and the red and the yellow all that are in the grave will hear his voice this is not the trumpet no this is not the trumpet of first Thessalonians this is another voice they will hear his voice calling out for it will be like the voice that Jesus used when he was calling Lazarus out of the say Lazarus come forth brother bam said if he had not called Lazarus all of them would have come out of their graves why because that is the same voice which will call them out says come out all of them will come out amen and now they that have done good they will get life and they that have done evil will get damnation follow me closely here now this is not the Rapture because in the Rapture not all Rise Up from the dead only the elect Rise Up from their gra amen but on this Resurrection which is the last Resurrection all the dead whether they died in Christ or not whether they were Believers or not they will all rise up so when we talk about the resurrection all shall rise all shall rise you remember when when when I think Mary they were talking about their brother and Jesus said he shall rise and they said yes we know he shall rise again said your brother will live again they said yes we know we know the last day they were talking about this day on that day he shall rise again he said no I'm not talking about that I am the resurrection and the life so in other words even today there are those going to rise before this day come just like rarus rose from the grave amen and whoever will rise in the resurrection in the first resurrection amen is already Rising today the resurrection is already taking place hallelujah praise the name of the Lord so which Resurrection will you be a part [Music] of now when you go to the Book of Revelation um we will go to vers [Music] 11 and I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is The Book of Life and the day were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and the death and death sorry and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire praise the name of the Lord now the prophet says there will be both the righteous and the unrighteous in the judge it says so this righteous will not be the bride amen are you are you are you here the righteous will not be the bride wait did you hear what I just say there will be on the day of judgment there will be the righteous and the unrighteous on the day of judgment according to what we have just read here but you know the righteous in here he says will not be the bride for the bride sits with him in the Judgment are you hearing me the righteous is I mean the bride is not here to be judged by the time the bride is already gone in the Rapture come down with him Ru with him for 1,000 years and now he's seated with him on the throne to judge the living and the dead hallu and so when we talk about the righteous and the unrighteous by this time among them the bride is not the bride is together with Christ on the Judgment SE I want you to understand what it takes to be the bride follow closely Now 1 Corinthians 6 ver2 do do you not know that the saint shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters know ye not that we shall judge Angels how much more things that pertain to this to this [Music] [Music] life praise the name of the Lord who are the Saints I am the Saints you are the Saints the bride of Christ is the Saints and the Bible says don't you know the Saints shall judge the world we will be with him on the Judgment seat in Revelation 3:21 he says to him that overcometh I will grant to sit with me in my throne even as I overcame and I'm set down with my father in his throne brother sister let us fight let us fight to overcome let us overcome sin you know the Bible says we are Kings and we are priests with God a king of what we are Kings over sin we are ruling Hallelujah if we are a king we cannot be a King Without a kingdom our kingdom is the kingdom of God we are ruling in the kingdom of God ruling over the kingdom of the world ruling over the power of sin ruling over the you know talk about the uh the pride of life whatever is pulling the others it is under our feet we are ruling over it if we are not ruling over it yet then you are not a king yet but as far as I'm concerned amen I am a king we are supposed to rule over last rule over sin rule over the world rule over live above these things over alcohol rule over addiction rule over all we are supposed to live the things that are pulling others the things that are killing others we are supposed to rule over we supposed to be AB that is why we are Kings Hallelujah and we are also priest why are we PR holy holy unto the Lorden we are serving him hallelujah hallelujah every sacrifices the sacrifice amen unto the Lord amen what is our sacrifice that's why we worship that's why we sing that's why we dance that's why we clap our hands that's why we come to church what are we coming to do we coming to sacrifice our life is a sacrifice we live amen a sacrifice life unto the Lord we are living holy unto the Lord we are leaving the world behind us and we putting the cross ahead of us that where we are Kings and we are prto the Lord and so here he promising his word and he said to him that overcomes who will overcome T to him that oh another place it says I must fight if I should ra increase my courage oh how many want more courage increase myage don't give up sister don't give up brother you may be fighting in your marriage you may be fighting in your home you may be fighting in your life come on don't give up keep fighting until you overcome don't let amen the word of God go away from your let the word of God always in your when others forsake Him don't forsake Him when others leave him don't leave him sister stick with the word sck with Jesus the more you do that you are overcoming you overcoming and one of these days he will say Well done th good and faithful walk into the joy of the Lord well done amen and you would have overcome oh how many know that song we shall overcome we shall overcome we shall overcome Satan's power oh we shall we shall over oh we shall overcome Satan's power well but in the spirit we have overcome we have overcome we have overcome we have overcome sat oh we have overcome we have overcome so you see to him that will like gr Hallelujah am it is a royal Grant do you know you given you don't deserve it but you were given the others who will come on the Judgment they will be judged according to their works but to these ones who will overcome sin what is sin sin is unbelief amen so what how will they overcome by believing every word if you are a Believer today that will overcome will grant you he will give you a royal gr to sit with him on his thr Oh Glory to God Amen Hallelujah even as he overcame how did Jesus over he didn't do anything of of himself he said whatever I do my father shows me I don't do anything on myself we overcome by yielding to the Holy Ghost by living under the Holy Ghost by being led by the Holy Ghost if the Holy Spirit leads us we have no work of our own we have nothing good to Bo of our is him in us both to do amen and to to will of his own good pleasure he living in us to fulfill his will at the end of the day he will give us a royal Hallelujah he will give us and he will say come here sit with me now you are my hallelujah amen we are going to judge with him we are going to sit with him tell your neighbor we are going to sit with him on hisone glory to God see the bride is with him in the throne as she is to judge the world she has to be sitting in the Judgment with him that is exactly what Daniel saw and it takes us to Daniel 7 vers 9 I beheld till the Thrones were cast down and the angels and the Ancient of Days rather sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fury flame and his wheels as as burning fire a fe Street issued and came forth from before [Applause] him you are going to love this one listen thousands thousands ministered unto [Music] him hallelujah amen did you get that thousands thousands thousands thousands ministered unto him who ministers to a husband the wife thousands thousands minister to him these are the same thousands who were with him right on the CL Hallelujah when we say behold he com riding on the clouding like the sun we will be right behind him he will be coming down to the Earth to to set up his kingdom but the bride will be with him to minister to him as a wife ministers to hus are you following me are you following me and 10,000 times 10,000 stood before himu thousands thousands ministered to him the few the small number El 10, [Music] 10 that's a great great big number stood before the Judgment was set and the books were open this is the same thing we've read in Revelation the Judgment was set and the books were open in Revelation he said and another book was open which was The Book of Life see it is the same scene for the thousands thousands who are ministering to him are the [Music] bride for who ministers the husband but the wife are you following me so far but the question now arises why are these righteous ones in the Judgment not the bride but the other ones were why are they now in judg now listen to me Church some people think only Believers of the message will get eternal life that is not correct only Believers of the message are in the bride now not only in our generation but in all Generations even before ours the body of the Bride is not in one generation it is in the old gentle Church ages right from ephes to to all other ages and what happened God was raising a church there was an elect out of each generation out of each age those will be among the chosen elect the few but those will he take heed on every word they will hear they will never inject their ideas they will preach the message the way it is they will believe it the way it is they will believe the messengers of their age they will accept the word of their day as long as the word said it they believe it that is the bride and they automatically have eternal life because they deserve it but because they have been granted it Faith through Grace so there is no way the bride can go to hell no no completely no way their names are in another compartment of The Book of Life called the Lamb's Book of Life those ones are the one the lamb gave his blood for they would not have made it otherwise without this blood but the Blood makes the difference for them I am one of them blood makes the difference I Was So Unworthy but the blood made the difference I am what I am today because of the blood Hallelujah and then we see but that there are others that are good that even we shall see that they even get eternal life but they are not in the bright did you hear that so not everybody who doesn't go in the Rapture will go to hell not everyone who doesn't go in the Rapture will go to hell no there are many people who will actually be in heaven having previously missed the Rapture well of course it depends what you call Heaven because what what I'm referring to as heaven now is eternal life are you following me but don't make conclusions yet follow me closely so the question now arises why are these righteous ones in the Judgment there is no other place that they can come up for there are but two resurrections and since they could not qualify for the first resurrection they must have come up in the second remember the only thing that qualifies you to be in the first resurrection is the is being the bright the bright only the bride will be interrupted are you following me now okay brother M make sure you move with me because I don't want to distract the people all right so follow me closely here now since they could not qualify for the first resurrection they must come up in the second which is a resurrection unto judgment now the ones who qualify for the first resurrection the bride are not in the Judgment they didn't get it the ones who qualify for the first resurrection they are the bride they will never be in the judgment and he gives us a scripture here John 524 very verily I say unto you he that Hearth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life that is the believer is already the recipient of eternal life which he the believe has in his possession now they didn't get it still he that believeth in my word in the message in the word in the revealed word he that believes has Everlasting what does it mean it is not something in the future in Thea the moment you believe you possess Eternal lifeu I am a possessor of eternal life I cannot be dragged into hell that is not even a thought not a chance the devil has no chance when he stand before a real J believer the devil did not have a chance when he stood before job because job was a Believer he could not have a chance the only thing that could make the devil have power over job was if job unbelieved the word of God that's why his wife kept on telling you are suffering too much cast God and be separated from him Forever cast God and die death is a total separation meaning cast God and go to hell but he did not he held on to the world he regardless regardless of feelings regardless of what he saw regardless of what he felt regardless of to the world and because of that the devil did not have a chance the devil has no chance amen over you brother over you sister your loved ones as long as you can believe every word of God the devil has no chance hallu over your soul that's why We Sing It is Well my soul because the enemy cannot do you can take my my body burn it up kill it take my spirit and hurt me but my soul is in the hands of God no one has access Hallelujah and shall not come into condemnation you already possess eternal life now and you will not come into condemnation shall not come into judgment is what it really means you will not come in the Judgment but but is passed but you have passed sorry permanent from Death unto life oh you need to shout a big you have already passed from you can say it over yourself I'm already passed from to life amen I cannot die I am a permanent possessor of eternal life yes hallelujah amen but notice carefully Jesus must have yet another group in mind who at a certain Resurrection will receive eternal life mine I have it now I'm just waiting for the rapture but there are those who shall receive it later be careful not to be very very judgmental when someone disagrees with you you are going to hell be careful be careful love everybody it makes me love everybody everybody this is what this old time religion [Music] does these people they will receive it at the resurrection not having previously received it as a member of the Bride because they were never member of the Bride praise God these are they the on that we reading about here in John 5 which says Mar not at this not the hour is coming in the which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice and shall come forth and they that have done good unto the resurrection of the of life so those are the Righteous now they will get life Hallelujah and they that have done evil the resurrection of dation now we all know that John 528 is not the Rapture for only the dead in Christ will rise from the graves at the time along with a living bride who is still on the earth this is not the Rapture Only The Dead In Christ will arise from the graves and at that time according to first Thessalonians the dead in ch rise the ones who are still living in Christ shall be changed and they will go to meet the Lord in the air that's the Rapture of the Bride but this other one of John 5 is for the other group but it says in John 5828 that all are going to come forth from the Grau but when you read first Thessalonians 4:6 follow closely here it says for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and that shout has already gone forth is the message of the hour and the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise fast this is not for all this Resurrection is for a few I am one of the few then we which are alive and remain who the Believers shall be caught up together with them in the cloud to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord why because from that time we will never be separated we will go to heaven come back to earth everywhere with him my God are you not so happy because of that promise but it says here in John 5 that all are going to come forth from the grave this is the very same resurrection that is spoken of in Revelation 2011 where in the dead were brought before the Lord and judged according to their works and all whose names were not in the Book of Life then they were cast into the Lake of Fire now we now F the question as to why they should be given eternal life at the Judgment since the Epistles seem to conclusively point out that one must possess the spirit of Christ or perish [Music] the Epistles when you read it it kind of shows as if to say you either possess the spirit of Christ or perish or go to hell there are many who would preach that kind of so though it seems thus we must not discredit the words of Jesus who most pointedly sets forth that there are some found in the Book of Life who will either receive eternal life before the general Resurrection or after now Paul does not evade this Truth for he most clearly says in Philippians 31 if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection [Music] now this statement is very special here we all know that we we all going to be in a in a resurrection whether we want it or not all will be resurrected so Paul could hardly be saying if by any means I might attain to a resurrection of the Dead uhuh the truth of the matter is he is not saying that he is saying if by any means I might attain to a to the out Resurrection from the among the dead this is not the attaining to the general or second Resurrection but attaining to the first resurrection so in other words Paul was listen listen Paul was trying to say there is two different resurrections there is the resurrection which is the first resurrection for those ones who go in the Rapture and then there's the second resurrection of everybody out of which others will be given life and others will be damed forever but Paul was saying he wants to be a part of the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection that's why the Book of Revelation says such the second death no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall re with him for a hallelujah amen glory to God I me we are writing Revelation chapter 20 that's where we are reading that just in case you want to hear it again vers four and I saw Thrones and they that sat upon them the Judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God and which had not worshiped the Beast neither his image neither had received his Mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years but the rest of the Dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that has part in the the first resurrection on such the second death has no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years my god listen to I am going to be in the first resurrection Hallelujah the first resurrection is not for everybody it is for the elect it is for the few it is for the bride Revelation 197 the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made Christ has a wifeu when you Maring you don't marry everyone in the you marry one the chosen one out of all of them you all know when you are very busy looking for a wife it is very difficult for you brothers because you you don't want to make a mistake you want to marry someone that is perfectly your Ty someone who will agree with you someone who will do what you want someone who submit to you someone who will be a mother to Children someone who will be a good wife to you in the same way Jesus Christ is not going to marry any woman he finds church is a symbol of a woman or woman is a symb of a church are you following me tell your neighbor are you following all right listen now praise the name of the Lord so we see here that now the woman is a type of the church but we have so many churches today that claim to be the wife of Christ but their character does not show Christ their life does not represent the word they have rejected him in their works in their words in their songs in their worship and they claim to be the wife of Christ but on that day he says he will say unto them I never knew you workers of iniquity with their false baptisms with their false teachings of trinities and all these things there are many Creeds and dog and they claim to be the wife of Christ and he would say I never knew you yes they had the portion of anointing upon them could do some signs and wonders and when they come to him they will tell him but we have done many signs we have shown many signs performed many miracles in your name are you hearing me church and he will tell them I never knew you do words of iniquity yes you did the Miracles as far as my word is concerned my Doctrine I never knew it he will put them away but today they claim to be their wife of Christ you find all these sisters so called you know painting their faces with all these fingers i p young men who marry women like that because can even never make a good wife let alone being the wife of Christ women in the church show the spiritual state of that church phally speaking it shows the spiritual the way they dress the way they talk the way they behave it shows the spiritual state of the church so now they have rejected Christ in every good work in every good doctr so they won't be the bride no they won't be the bride because the bride hears and follows every word how many remember was beautiful nice and everything but when the king said please call me queen I want to display her before my people she said go tell the king I have my own party that's how the church is today in their sanctuaries they are doing their own parties it's not for Christ they have rejected him they have denied him with all their sexy dances completely in B it is not our God and do you know what they claim they claim that they trying to attract the Young Generation to God let me tell you you younger people we will not do stupid things to attract you to Jesus Christ no we are going to teach the word we are going to preach Holiness we are going to teach the doctrine of Christ if that can pull to none of his Hallelujah that's why in this church and in any belie believer's church around the world we don't pull and beg people to come to church we go to the radios we preach we go on the streets we preach come in chch we preach the word will pull those who were meant for it Hallelujah are you hearing me are you hearing me so if you come here and don't like what you're hearing we can't force you to stay but if you love the world you cannot go away even if we tell you go away you will say where to whom can we go who has the words of oh are you not so glad because of the word praise the name of the Lord and so the true church the bride will be her that believes every she will be an whereever he is she wants to be she wants to put up a fist for him hallelujah amen are you not so happy to have a feast of the Everywhere You amen you invite him in your house every evening every morning you invite him at the family altar come to the feast come to the feast and every time you invite him he will come even now you have invited him and whenever you invite him he will show up and what happens at the end of it he will give you the desires of your heart Hallelujah the desire of our hearts the longing of our hearts is not money is not power is not presti no the longing of our heart is to be with him is to go in the Rapture is it the Ling of your heart is to fly away Hallelujah that's why when we sing songs about the Rapture if you notice we always get happy because something on the inside is calling for it Fly you begin to feel so happy because your your spiritual body is calling for it so the bride is not part of the second Resurrection the second Resurrection is going to be for those who had previously not attained eternal life for us we attain eternal life by belief of the truth we have already passed from judgment [Applause] life we can never be judged day therefore we cannot even come before the wife judgment our judgment is finished on forget about those people who tell you all of us are going to come not me I will not come before the white Jud I will not be there sorry if you tell them that and they said no all of us are going to come before the Jud tell them you don't know what you're talking about the Bible tells me there is there for now no judgment no condemnation to those that are in Christ they have already passed from Death un life I already have eternal life now I possess in my soul I cannot die to I've already died once when I di to sin and I'm born again by the power of the amen I'm only waiting for one body change and I come out of this body that's what I'm waiting foru so now we notice here um in Philippians Apostle Paul was saying there is two resurrections but he was saying I want to be part of the first because blessed and holy is he is part in the first resurrection the second death has no power do you know what the second death is the second death is permanent destruction of the are you hearing me some people think there is eternal hell listen to me there is nothing like eternal hell so somebody say oh we will burn tonight there is nothing like that if they are going in Hell which is eternal also means they have received eternal life think about it we only have one type of life with is zo God is life and God is life you can only be attained by receiving it he only he either gives it to you as a royal [Music] Grant if you are in the bride you receive it as a royal he gives it to you by somehow doing things that pleases [Applause] him but that will be up to him on the Judgment Day and if you allow me I'll show you here a few types of people that will receive it they receive it he will give it to them and only those and ask the bride will have eternal life all the rest will be thrown into Hell and Hell be thrown into the Lake of Fire and for how long shall they burn they will burn forever and ever but ever and ever has an end it's not a tel maybe 10,000 years maybe one billion years of it all he will do away with things because the Bible now in Revelation 31 he says behold I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth old Earth and old Heaven pass away with a great noise I do not think the devil will have a part in the new heaven I do not things that in the new Earth and new heav we shall have a hell so he will do away with everything praise the name of the Lord so Paul was saying I want to be a part of this blessed first resurrection so I don't enter into the second death the first resurrection has nothing to do with second death that is at the end of the Thousand Years when all the rest of the Dead live again you know the dead are dead during the 1,000 years even at the end of the Thousand Years the Bible says there will be the the devil lose that he will come in the people who will be living at temp them go and attack the city and and while they attack it fire will come from burn all of them so but then after that all the dead will rise again they will be judged according to their works there are so many people who say it doesn't matter what you do they are right but they are the wrong people to claim those words those ones only belong to the bride because apart from the bride everybody else will be judged their so it matters what they do but to the bride it's a royal Grant by faith through Grace the only thing it tells the bride only believe only just believe leave the rest for me believe only believe only as long as you believe my word leave your sins for the blood to come leave rest for me I am going in into the Rapture by a royal Grand not by my good it does not count Hallelujah to the bride but to the rest they will be judged according to their works as for what was written in the Book of Life and we see there are several others for example there are those who were good to the Brethren they will go in I I don't have time to go into the details there are others who had the souls under the altar those ones they were the Jews under the revelation of the fif seal we see the souls under the they were crying oh Lord how long they were crying for vengeance who are these These are Jews who were killed by Hitler and and and and these other people that put them in the concentration camp and you know these people were are not having the testimony of Jesus but these people believed in God according to the testimony they held because of that they will be given etal life no details no time for details then comes the other group The foolish virgins they will also receive eternal life there are many people whose names were on the book of life but they were removed but these ones their names was not removed they were foolish virgins they couldn't come up in the rapture but they were given eternal life because they were virgins in oh my there are many things we can look at there's also the 144,000 Jews who are servants who go everywhere where the where the bridegroom is those even go in before the white Throne judgment so you see friends there are many other groups that receive etal life but I'm so thankful I'm not part of those group because those groups it will be very difficult for them to get it to to be accepted because of your Works who can do works that will move [Music] God it will Sur be another level of [Music] Grace higher level than ours but ours is so easy only believe hallelujah amen and you will go in the resurrection praise God God bless you bless you can stand up on your [Music] feet praise God is in the Lord good church that he can give us Grace and a royal Grant that we can be able to get this that we have today etal life let us seeing I'm thinking of the rupture but if you're going to be part of those sing it with enthusiasm clap your hands together I am thinking of the Rapture in a blessing home on High when the redeem are gathering in how we raise the Heavenly and fame in the city in the sky when the redeemed are gathering in oh when the redeemed the Gathering in
