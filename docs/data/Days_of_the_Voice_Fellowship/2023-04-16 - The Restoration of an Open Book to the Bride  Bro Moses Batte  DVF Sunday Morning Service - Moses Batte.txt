fish of the sea and over the fall with air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over creeping think that creepers upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he's him unta and God bless them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and so would you eat and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth we shall open Revelation chapter 5. amen Amina [Music] uh and I saw in the right hand of him that said upon sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with the Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof and no man in heaven no inias neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look their own and I Whip too much because no man was found worthy to open to open and read the book neither to look there on one of the elders said unto me whip not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has Preferred to open the book and to lose the Seven Seals thereof and I behaved and law in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood alarm as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four twin Elders fell down before the lab having every one of them hops in God and virus full of others which are the prayers of the Saints and they sang a new song saying Thou Art to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou washling and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nations it has made us and to our god Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the Earth I mean today is [Music] [Music] another might angel come down from heaven closed with a cloud and the rainbow is upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of Fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roars and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders uttered their voices I was about right and I had a voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things with the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and served by him who live forever more forever and ever who created heaven and thinks that rearing and the earth and the things that bearing and the Sea and the things which are wearing that are that that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when it shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I had from Heaven spoke unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel and which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy Berry bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and I ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations in tanks and kings men [Music] foreign foreign advance father in the name of Jesus Christ you know any person

to you may the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] because of the blessing because you declare the blessing in reading the words Lord we are already blessed that we pray that you may come down in this place in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Amina glory be to God I want to speak on something a restoration amen amen the restoration praise God this is our food in America are Faith this is our message

you our Lord Jesus Christ amen man it did not come to die at this that people can sympathize with him and say because he died not to make a loss let us just empathize with him it was not like that Jesus came for the purpose yes yes there were some people on the Earth and I want to tell you no matter what let our devil rage sit down let him do whatsoever wishes cannot grounded God's children must be free they're supposed to be free do you get Church praise God come here hallelujah Amina I pray that God gives Grace Decatur so that every one of us should understand the reason why we are here is amen just to live on yes but we only ask for the purpose praise God you are here for the purpose you are not here just for a second opinion you enjoy and have good life that is not a reason why God brought you yeah amen so if we go back to Genesis 1.26 God was pleased that God looked around he had created all the creatures praise God there was no creature that looked like him now you know whatever something that looks like him okay because God is wanted to have somebody he can rule God never wanted to be a dictator he wanted to reign with you he wanted to reign with somebody but when he looked at amen in the likeness in our likeness amen amen and then have dominion over the fish of the sea before praise God and over the phone of air Mary book our Guru and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepers upon them hey so God created man in his own image Amen in the image of God created in him um the likeness of God and in the image of God praise God what is the likeness of God what is this image praise God so we know God is a it's a powerful being together praise God hallelujah hallelujah so when you created in this image in his family it means you are to protect your air to partake of the character of God what God is praise God do you get this amen amen if you scoop a cup of water from the big ocean amen the contents which are in that that ocean every room they are the same contents which are in the this little water in the cup you get that much so if God when God creates you and it's likeness in this image foreign speaking amen amen you should know this the devil sit down it's a creature of time Satan she turned a child do you know that Devil is a creature of Thai sit down and charity came down to we the children of God we are not creatures of times we should understand that church let us go back today or before Genesis amen go backwards in your mind billions and billions of years amen there was a source of life amen he was not even a god out of what foreign praise God man one time job was complaining about his sufferings amen if I can't get a chance and find that door to heaven and present my my reasons why am I suffering like this why this and this is [Applause] foreign amen praise God amen amen so he reminded him where he was he he was in God hallelujah amen when the sons of God together oh my Hallelujah I believe job realize praise God hallelujah amen I was there not real amen amen in job instead of complaining he started now to repent that's what happened to some of us after God opening your eyes that's the suffering you're going through time is to build your character you will be thankful unto God foreign [Music] Hallelujah man you see whatever if you want to get a degree foreign um he can even be a child which God wants you to be glory be to Jesus amen those materials are here amen man praise God so that's how God has said it when God wanted David to be a king he never took him to the school Hallelujah he never trained him praise God by the institutions what did he do equality God took David to the Wilderness he took him in the wilderness and what did God bring God used the nature praise the Lord amen hallelujah what did God bring called brought a lion praise God Amen God brought a bear there is a great work Church oh praise God hallelujah amen that training which David went through okay it is the training that enabled him to defeat Korea with us Everybody Was Defeated King saw was defeated everyone was defeated glory be to God but there was he said I can approach him praise the Lord when he looked at him when he looked at glorious he asked the question where is this answer come so please foreign praise God don't bring us troubles foreign [Applause] foreign foreign that's why children of God when you realize who you are to face the situation you should prophesy you speak about it hallelujah amen God start to three more no no no no no no it is time to speak the word and go forward foreign [Music] amen uptown these soldiers hearing that but yes and David asked them okay the one who shall kill that man what is the reward amen amen they told him the king will give you this he'll give him this praise God amen amen and David said I can put down that man oh yeah he's not a circumcised person praise God I can kill him and he was taken to the king amen amen then the king interviewed him he looked at him praise God man amen okay give me do you have some testimonies one day I was taking care of my father's ship I felt with it and I killed it hey okay he had a testimony I'm not yet finished wait on now another time the lion came I mean when the lion came I got the Lambs and I killed it Changi amen and he went down in the valley and I want to tell you the reason why the Philistines because they were champions in The Valleys they knew how to fight in The Valleys because one time they said their God is a god of mountains but our gods are gods of valleys so they had to choose the ground favorable for them our God is a court of mountains at the same ways of God glory be to God so he went never again he went again glory be to God the Philistines amen why this shall be challenged glory be to go home for 40 days means the end of Temptation that is when the Savior came um praise God Amen I shall fight him foreign hallelujah amen amen David [Music] glorious was still roaring he was praise God Amen praise God Amen amen seeing a boy I asked for a man but you're sending a boy what is that amen praise God and this boy he started picking stones Ninja praise God picking Stones amen [Music] praise God Amen and the Bible says glorious cast David glorious in his courts foreign praise God Amen David depict the stones five Stones representing faith Hallelujah representing the name of Jesus Hallelujah has put us he was putting them in his path and a man was roaring and he told him I will cut off your head you don't have a sword what would you use praise God Amen I don't need to have a soul but the world is enough praise God Amen so I can see glorious we started churches and he started to swing it in the name of Jesus this is the name of Jesus yes he lose the stone not the ginger glory be to God amen amen man what does that teach you could not kill that man a ginger yeah Hallelujah but when the stone was released it was my face hallelujah amen God in church he got in charge the Holy Ghost got the Stars it was no longer in the hands of death it was no longer in the country of death was in the court of the holy spirit that God of Israel a ginger went straight amen and I normally say that God yes there is no way could Escape that story no matter what he could do he dodged it could not miss because it was in the hands of God he knew the target God knows hallelujah amen God directed The Storm and glorious when he said foreign glory be to God amen hallelujah amen so when he killed him all the children of Israel they were empowered hallelujah amen and they came after the enemies praise God so that's what happened church have been giving that to show that when God wants to build a character in you but again Hallelujah there are some materials just put in the world God uses a lot of things to serve you praise God Amen so if we are to get back to our sermon that is amen the Bible says but God created a man in his own image and see over the fish Over the Sea over the force of air that even come back and avocado and over every creeping thing creepers upon yes so God created a man he created him to have power over everything on the earth created you amen praise God amen amen hallelujah but the man to reach somewhere he lost it yeah amen God was supposed to be a god of universe it's supposed to be an amateur God he's supposed to rule under God so everything that is under the Dominion of a man that is Adam according to the scriptures foreign foreign [Music] whatever God wants foreign praise God amen amen hallelujah amen so after naming all the things God said it is so much it is now you would have got to this earth dominion over everything and Adam Adam started to have dominion to rule
