[1:21:51] photographed just just remind me
[1:21:55] please what magazine published
[1:22:00] it was it was it
[1:22:03] death was it the end of
[1:22:08] time you think this is just a
[1:22:11] coincidence with God there is no
[1:22:14] coincidence it was published in Life
[1:22:18] Magazine is the only
[1:22:20] life that is Jesus Christ
[1:22:24] amen amen so we have the answer to
[1:22:28] Satan God has Vindicated
[1:22:31] himself God has proved himself amen his
[1:22:35] promise in this day amen you know what
[1:22:38] the prophet
[1:22:39] says headship is here
[1:22:44] now that's why so many
[1:22:48] people many people don't want to accept
[1:22:52] th
[1:22:54] precious they reject the
[1:22:57] message they criticize the cloud they
[1:23:00] criticize the pillar of
[1:23:03] fire you know what I just just shows me
[1:23:07] you know the the Bible tells us that we
[1:23:09] are known by our
[1:23:12] [Music]
[1:23:16] fruits but to those that
[1:23:20] believe it is precious it's a
[1:23:23] reality it is life it is my
[1:23:29] head amen amen Christ the Risen
[1:23:34] Lord heing the same power of his
[1:23:37] resurrection you're not hearing
[1:23:40] me Christ the Risen Lord is here in the
[1:23:46] same power
[1:23:50] Resurrection it's God and
[1:23:53] himself coming to a place amen and he's
[1:23:57] governed by the
[1:23:59] body all the way
[1:24:01] through then the complete body is
[1:24:04] revealed in the form of a
[1:24:08] bride that was taken out of his
[1:24:16] side that's why we are a
[1:24:20] chosen a pecul
[1:24:24] with a
[1:24:27] precious people called me
[1:24:29] anall people call me a Holy Roller maybe
[1:24:33] people call me
[1:24:34] Pentecostal let me back up with the
[1:24:37] word and I'm going back to my
[1:24:40] origin the Holy Ghost and
[1:24:43] Fire reality not an
[1:24:46] emotion religion
[1:24:49] denomination
[1:24:51] experience
[1:24:56] amen that's why after the opening of the
[1:24:59] seals the prophet says Amen in the
[1:25:03] message of rapture the sight of
[1:25:08] God I took my glasses
[1:25:10] off I'm not going to ask you to take
[1:25:13] your eyes
[1:25:15] off we always look through our
[1:25:18] eyes we have
[1:25:20] senses but there's a
[1:25:24] that has to put this whole body in
[1:25:27] obedience the word of God so it doesn't
[1:25:31] matter in your eyes I don't want to know
[1:25:34] what you think about me I want to know
[1:25:37] what God thinks
[1:25:39] about so inside of God the is
[1:25:43] Justified she's never done it in the
[1:25:45] first place she's standing there
[1:25:49] married to The Virtuous Son of God
[1:25:53] never sinned in the first place she
[1:25:55] stands there
[1:26:02] virt John saw what Daniel
[1:26:06] saw Daniel 12 but he had to seal up
[1:26:10] those
[1:26:11] things until the end
[1:26:14] time John wasn't allowed to speak it in
[1:26:18] Revelation but what happened when he saw
[1:26:21] the Plan of Redemption
[1:26:24] John is a type of the
[1:26:25] Bride Revelation
[1:26:27] 10:7 you know that scripture the days of
[1:26:31] the voice of the seven Angel when he
[1:26:33] shall begin to sound the mysty of
[1:26:36] God declared to
[1:26:38] his now the Greek Lexicon
[1:26:43] finish to do just as
[1:26:48] commanded and it says generally
[1:26:50] involving a notion of time
[1:26:55] listen carefully now don't fall asleep
[1:26:57] it's the morning you
[1:27:00] rest because it's
[1:27:02] important because when the bride
[1:27:04] realizes who she
[1:27:06] is will take place there something
[1:27:09] important about the opening of the word
[1:27:13] Christ amen so it shall be finished it
[1:27:16] says to
[1:27:18] perform the last
[1:27:20] act which
[1:27:22] complet a
[1:27:28] process it is
[1:27:31] finished where are the accusers
[1:27:35] now it is
[1:27:39] finished but through the lapse of
[1:27:44] time we forgot who we
[1:27:47] were why we were here
[1:27:50] for amen but we are here he what
[1:27:53] for to manifest
[1:27:59] God's revelation 22 you know I John saw
[1:28:03] these things I heard him and when I
[1:28:05] heard him I fell down to worship before
[1:28:10] of the Angel we showed things and he
[1:28:13] said see thou do it not I am thy fellow
[1:28:16] servant the Brethren of the prophets and
[1:28:19] of them which keep the sayings of this
[1:28:21] book
[1:28:23] worship
[1:28:25] God don't worship
[1:28:32] Him are you hearing
[1:28:34] me don't worship a
[1:28:40] man no matter how great God is
[1:28:45] using Brother Bram
[1:28:47] says God gives a gift to
[1:28:50] someone bless him
[1:28:52] and as soon as he starts he thinks he
[1:28:54] has
[1:28:56] something you know what
[1:28:58] happens God pulls
[1:29:02] away so if God send us a messenger in
[1:29:05] our
[1:29:08] time to reveal the
[1:29:12] word to what to be a
[1:29:15] [Music]
[1:29:20] mouthpiece but to reveal
[1:29:24] means the seals are
[1:29:26] broken the Mysteries are
[1:29:29] revealed you don't need somebody else to
[1:29:32] come and step on the platform
[1:29:34] now seven Thunders have their
[1:29:38] voes we don't need somebody to come and
[1:29:41] tell us what are about it's been
[1:29:46] revealed that's what the Thunders is
[1:29:50] about
[1:29:53] so worship God and God
[1:29:56] alone and then verse 10 seal not the
[1:29:58] sayings of the prophecy of this book The
[1:30:01] Time Is Now where the word is in the
[1:30:05] bride to do the Greater
[1:30:08] Works amen amen
[1:30:11] amen when you read
[1:30:13] Daniel or even some read
[1:30:17] Revelation it's a symbol
[1:30:20] form but glory be to
[1:30:22] God bride it's an open
[1:30:26] book brother Bram says the seven
[1:30:29] Thunders which equals seven
[1:30:31] Mysteries already been
[1:30:36] revealed you don't know it maybe it's
[1:30:39] some
[1:30:40] teaching some powerful teaching word
[1:30:44] they reveal in the Seven Seals but yet
[1:30:47] are not known to us as
[1:30:49] Thunders no they were revealed F in the
[1:30:52] seven SE that's what the Thunders is
[1:30:55] about amen you are the pure you are the
[1:30:59] pure virtuous virtuous sinless
[1:31:05] bride the son of the Living
[1:31:10] God you know brother

[1:31:19] Factory how many remember that story
[1:31:27] he visit this
[1:31:29] Factory so the the manager presents
[1:31:34] him how everything works

[1:32:09] metal now brother Bram he visits a
[1:32:12] manufacturing

[1:41:40] the she can know who she is and she can
[1:41:43] know what's the original
[1:41:46] place like the prophet says you've never
[1:41:49] sinned in the first place
[1:41:51] does that mean you will never sin on
[1:41:54] you no no no because he who says that
[1:41:58] never sins

[1:42:57] Lord not William
[1:42:59] Bram he would have made an enormous
[1:43:04] mistake if he wouldn't have come
[1:43:12] down but that's thus say the
[1:43:15] Lord and this
[1:43:18] word positions me as what as the pure
[1:43:25] virtuous bride of Jesus
[1:43:28] Christ why Satan has to be under
[1:43:34] my
[1:43:37] amen he has no dominion over
[1:43:41] me I we should be

[1:44:37] bride hallelujah hallelujah when my wife

[1:45:17] prophet said nothing of himself
[1:45:21] was God speaking
[1:45:25] through
[1:45:28] amen so if Satan stands in front of
[1:45:31] you you say the wedding
[1:45:35] ring is already placed on my fing from
[1:45:39] before the foundation of the world so
[1:45:42] get the

[1:47:28] back to its rightful
[1:47:30] position where we
[1:47:33] had before the foundation of the world
[1:47:37] and you know what when a

[1:48:53] on the
[1:48:55] Rapture just put
[1:48:58] Satan his rightful
[1:49:01] position that is under my feet my
[1:49:13] feet Glory Glory
[1:49:17] Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah today he is
[1:49:21] standing Among Us in the person of the
[1:49:24] Holy Ghost manifesting
[1:49:28] himself more and more and
[1:49:32] more think of it we have been chosen for
[1:49:36] such a time as
[1:49:40] this where God is manifesting
[1:49:44] himself
[1:49:46] more and more and more
[1:49:50] coming into his
[1:49:52] church amen making himself
[1:49:55] known just looking for a quote
[1:49:58] here we might as well destroy utterly
[1:50:05] destroy coming into his church making
[1:50:08] himself
[1:50:09] known because him the bride and the
[1:50:14] groom will be the
[1:50:16] same and making himself known and the
[1:50:21] Word was in the
[1:50:23] beginning will go back to the
[1:50:26] beginning which is
[1:50:28] God that's why we are a word
[1:50:33] bride and at that
[1:50:35] day what
[1:50:39] day thank you Brothers what day this
[1:50:44] day you shall know that I am in the
[1:50:49] father
[1:50:52] here we
[1:50:56] are you know the prophet speaks about it
[1:50:59] rising of the
[1:51:02] Sun in the Bible we can read about the
[1:51:06] sun amen and then he links it to the s o
[1:51:12] n how many
[1:51:14] knows
[1:51:16] that the
[1:51:18] moon represents the
[1:51:21] bride in the
[1:51:23] natural the moon reflects the
[1:51:26] [Music]
[1:51:28] sun
[1:51:30] okay so let's look what the the
[1:51:36] words the moon says a prophet is the
[1:51:39] wife of the
[1:51:42] sun when the Sun goes
[1:51:44] away the Moon ref does it reflect its
[1:51:49] own light
[1:51:53] does it reflect the light of Bram
[1:51:56] Tabernacle reflect the the light of my
[1:51:59] [Applause]
[1:52:01] church it reflects the light of the s
[1:52:09] o we are the bride which is the Moon to
[1:52:14] reflect the light of the
[1:52:15] gospel and we can't reflect it until he
[1:52:20] Shines on
[1:52:22] us until he Shines
[1:52:24] on Shine On Me Lord
[1:52:28] Jesus now
[1:52:30] listen in the
[1:52:33] natural the moon has given an
[1:52:39] authority
[1:52:40] [Music]
[1:52:42] Hallelujah brother Brown
[1:52:44] says if you go to the
[1:52:47] ocean you can see those big and angry
[1:52:53] wave as they angrily push towards the
[1:52:58] shore and they would cover the whole
[1:53:03] earth if they
[1:53:07] could but God said to the
[1:53:11] Moon to watch the boundaries of the
[1:53:17] sea so when the Moon Turns its
[1:53:21] head the tie goes
[1:53:24] out when the Moon Turns its head
[1:53:28] back the tide
[1:53:33] follows when the moon goes
[1:53:36] down away goes the tide with it when the
[1:53:40] moon comes up here comes the
[1:53:46] tide what the prophet is telling us
[1:53:50] those big Angry
[1:53:54] waves of demonic
[1:53:57] power that try to take a hold
[1:54:01] of will come and try to
[1:54:05] against but God has given us an open
[1:54:10] book
[1:54:15] Authority when the Moon Turns the tie
[1:54:18] has to go when she turns back the tie
[1:54:22] fall it makes me think the Isaiah
[1:54:27] 59 so shall they fear the name of the
[1:54:29] Lord from the West and his glory from
[1:54:32] the rising of the
[1:54:33] sun when the enemy shall come in like a
[1:54:37] FL the spirit of the
[1:54:41] Lord and the redemer shall come to
[1:54:46] Zion hallelujah hallelujah and then to
[1:54:49] to them that turn from the transgression
[1:54:51] into Jacob say the
[1:54:53] Lord power of the Moon amen amen the
[1:54:57] Rapture will take place church will be
[1:55:00] taken home and when we will be taken
[1:55:03] home and the Great Tribulation will set
[1:55:11] in they asked the
[1:55:14] question I thought the church was to be
[1:55:16] raptured up before the tribulation
[1:55:18] period
[1:55:22] he says the church no not the church
[1:55:26] sorry the church but the
[1:55:30] bride only the bride
[1:55:32] is the church the bride is

[1:58:03] sermon because we know what we have need
[1:58:07] so we shouldn't be afraid amen how big

[1:58:38] right he's with us and in
[1:58:44] us you know

[1:58:52] probably there were
[1:58:54] some you know there are always critics

[1:59:05] always so here stands
[1:59:07] Moses I've been

[2:05:40] book to break the
[2:05:44] seals he
[2:05:46] wept he knew it was over

[2:06:50] now the
[2:06:52] members of his

[2:06:59] Book of
[2:07:03] Life when was my name written
[2:07:06] here that's my chair I'll
[2:07:11] take when was my name
[2:07:15] written why am I doing this Sint so you
[2:07:19] start visualizing
[2:07:20] it that's what happened before the
[2:07:23] foundation of the world my name was
[2:07:26] written in the L Book of
[2:07:29] Life have a place I have a
[2:07:34] place amen hallelujah and now he says
[2:07:39] and now it's being
[2:07:41] revealed names were in
[2:07:46] there so when John saw
[2:07:49] that the lamb came forward took the book
[2:07:53] and not only took the book opened the
[2:07:58] book everything in
[2:08:00] heaven everything in on Earth
[2:08:07] [Music]
[2:08:11] see my Bible tells
[2:08:14] me and everything under the Earth
[2:08:25] so you cannot
[2:08:32] over people think it's just an
[2:08:36] emotion since I saw my name in
[2:08:40] the I am so
[2:08:43] glad I can but shout I can but give
[2:08:47] glory to God
[2:08:49] he has chosen me he has saved me he has
[2:08:53] redeemed me he has Justified
[2:08:56] me
[2:09:00] glorified so
[2:09:02] everything under the
[2:09:04] Earth if you find a little animal under
[2:09:07] the
[2:09:08] Earth they heard John
[2:09:10] scream they heard John
[2:09:13] sh he saw his name in
[2:09:17] the
[2:09:20] and they want to call me to
[2:09:24] Pentecostal an
[2:09:27] organization the word was
[2:09:31] restored I will
[2:09:34] restore he restore us back to the true
[2:09:41] Pentecost
[2:09:47] amen
[2:09:50] H yes we have the full
[2:09:53] word but if you cannot
[2:09:56] Rejoice something is wrong with your
[2:09:59] Revelation something is wrong with the
[2:10:02] word mechanics so much mechanics that it
[2:10:06] BEC
[2:10:07] intellectual you need the
[2:10:10] Dynamics the
[2:10:12] mechanics that will take you in the
[2:10:15] Rapture so if charm a type of the
[2:10:19] Bride Can shout that everything in
[2:10:23] heaven everything on Earth and
[2:10:26] everything under the Earth heard him
[2:10:29] Rejoice oh let me have my freedom
[2:10:32] then glory to
[2:10:42] God the prophet of God
[2:10:45] says he just really
[2:10:48] was having a great
[2:10:52] time Hallelujah now saints of God are
[2:10:57] you having a good
[2:11:02] time just for to to to shut up the mouth
[2:11:06] of the
[2:11:09] critics you know in the world they
[2:11:12] say we had such a great
[2:11:15] time you know we shouted we
[2:11:20] jum that's not what I
[2:11:25] mean
[2:11:27] John when he
[2:11:30] saw that the lamb came
[2:11:33] forward he alone was worthy to look no
[2:11:37] man was
[2:11:38] worthy so brother
[2:11:42] [Music]
[2:11:44] Bram Christ himself came
[2:11:49] to to reveal
[2:11:52] himself so then when Jo
[2:11:55] saw that the lamb opened the book he saw
[2:11:59] his
[2:12:00] name he could rejoice and have a good
[2:12:06] time so when Christ is revealed
[2:12:09] personally to
[2:12:13] you you have a good time in the
[2:12:17] of
[2:12:19] hallelujah
[2:12:28] amen that's the reason I think says the
[2:12:32] prophet trying to find a space to wind
[2:12:34] up
[2:12:35] here that's the reason I think John was
[2:12:37] doing a lot of
[2:12:44] shouting you know why he must have seen
[2:12:48] his
[2:12:56] name and that
[2:12:58] Revelation can only come from our
[2:13:02] head to have Jesus Christ as a
[2:13:08] foundation that's why so many
[2:13:11] people even in the
[2:13:13] message this precious
[2:13:16] stone has been rejected
[2:13:21] but to me he is my
[2:13:28] everything so why shouldn't we
[2:13:31] shout cuz I was
[2:13:34] lost but I am
[2:13:38] found I was
[2:13:40] lost walking in the
[2:13:42] world having plans maybe to be an
[2:13:46] actor plans for
[2:13:50] him amen we can make
[2:13:54] plans but our plans are not his
[2:13:56] plan so let's make sure we seek his will
[2:14:01] first and his will for us is to do
[2:14:06] exploits amen amen you know coming back
[2:14:10] to
[2:14:12] John Let's nail that demon one more
[2:14:16] time
[2:14:19] because I hear the sound of
[2:14:24] Freedom the sound of our Jesus Christ
[2:14:29] that is blessing his people people are
[2:14:32] receiving their
[2:14:34] Revelation position Satan under their
[2:14:37] feet John must have really had a
[2:14:43] Pentecost so you go against Pentecost
[2:14:46] I'm not talking about sou
[2:14:50] street I'm talking about the upper room
[2:14:55] experience where brothers and
[2:14:58] sisters receive the baptism of the Holy
[2:15:05] Ghost the word
[2:15:07] says when the mighty rushing wind came
[2:15:11] in amen they climbed out of the
[2:15:15] windows they wanted to go out
[2:15:19] what are you brother
[2:15:21] DAV drunk of
[2:15:24] new what I have
[2:15:26] received what I have
[2:15:29] received is the message of my hand Jesus
[2:15:36] Christ is
[2:15:38] uniting right now day by
[2:15:46] day
[2:15:56] he had a
[2:16:01] Pentecost you want to talk about a happy
[2:16:07] time a happy
[2:16:10] time I tell my church back home I love
[2:16:12] to
[2:16:16] see
[2:16:18] how can you be in a
[2:16:20] [Applause]
[2:16:23] church we got the
[2:16:26] mechanics the word is so
[2:16:29] important brother BR
[2:16:32] says and they
[2:16:36] say like a dying
[2:16:46] Cal

[2:16:51] Dynamics no sir no sir when I hear the
[2:16:56] word of God telling me my
[2:17:01] Jesus telling me I am a chosen

[2:17:07] chosen for such a time as this to do the
[2:17:11] greater
[2:17:12] work exploit to be his
[2:17:16] wife
[2:17:18] oh yes Hallelujah I rather lose my
[2:17:22] voice worshiping Jesus
[2:17:26] Christ
[2:17:29] amen I don't want to be a dying
[2:17:32] cow want to be a stone I want to be a
[2:17:36] living
[2:17:37] Stone giving a
[2:17:39] sacrifice

[2:18:02] Spirits Spirit they will be
[2:18:06] working in the framework of the church
[2:18:09] in this end
[2:18:11] time that's why there's so much
[2:18:16] opposition and they call brother

[2:21:32] 11 and such as do
[2:21:35] wickedly against the Covenant shall he
[2:21:38] corrupt by
[2:21:40] flattery but the people that know their
[2:21:44] God they shall be strong and do
[2:21:51] exploits hallu the lexican the Greek
[2:21:54] lexican says
[2:21:57] wickedly to be

[2:23:27] wife is not
[2:23:29] worthy of his precious
[2:23:34] wife oh yes we can
[2:23:36] quote I know I can hurt somebody
[2:23:40] here
[2:23:41] speaking wives must be
[2:23:46] submissive
[2:23:54] can I quote you the rest of the
[2:23:58] scriptures love your
[2:24:01] wife like Christ
[2:24:13] love so if Christ now think of it if
[2:24:17] Christ would be like
[2:24:19] this we would be all
[2:24:22] lost but he loves us so
[2:24:24] much that I have no problem submiss so
[2:24:27] to
[2:24:28] him saying Lord let it be according to
[2:24:33] thy I accept it
[2:24:36] lord I Love You

[2:25:18] exp heroic
[2:25:20] act amen

[2:25:25] do
[2:25:28] why because the pillar of fire and the
[2:25:32] cloud our
[2:25:34] head is with us even in

[3:28:38] us and you know God has already blessed
[3:28:41] them
[3:28:45] you know whatever we have been taking
[3:28:47] out of these

[3:29:24] service will
[3:29:26] provide we not we're not anxious at
[3:29:31] all and I want to say this on this
[3:29:34] note God laid it on my
[3:29:37] heart that if I'm to invite any visiting
[3:29:40] minister
[3:29:44] I should never ask them to sponsor the
[3:29:50] meetings did I ask you toor the
[3:29:55] Mee in country and I'm saying this
[3:29:57] before you
[3:30:00] before when we see a different a
[3:30:03] beautiful skin color like this
[3:30:07] one the people
[3:30:10] think
[3:30:13] loed I'm now
[3:30:15] loed how many
[3:30:17] that you know that but I want to change
[3:30:21] this
[3:30:23] mentality is a wrong
[3:30:26] mentality a satanic
[3:30:29] mentality if if God has given someone a
[3:30:34] Ministry doesn't matter where they're
[3:30:36] coming
[3:30:37] from if we want love them to come we
[3:30:41] should receive them take care of
[3:30:45] them it should go into our
[3:30:48] heads as a matter of fact we should not
[3:30:52] only take care of them we should also
[3:30:54] give them love
[3:30:57] offering say
[3:31:00] Amen so Saints I want us to the
[3:31:03] remainder of this
[3:31:06] money give love offering to our
[3:31:09] brothers listen we we are a younger
[3:31:14] generation if we don't do it this
[3:31:17] way our children will also do it the
[3:31:19] wrong
[3:31:20] way we have toct some of these things we
[3:31:24] have to correct some of
[3:31:26] these and relate with people from
[3:31:28] America from Canada from
[3:31:35] whatevers God bless
[3:31:38] you that we should not worship them
[3:31:41] I don't worship
[3:31:43] Him older than me he my Elder same to
[3:31:46] brother
[3:31:48] Timothy they all
[3:31:50] my I don't worship them they my
[3:31:54] brothers and this is how we should
[3:31:57] see and I think in of
[3:32:02] Uganda the only that does it
[3:32:09] right
[3:32:13] where the Believers stand
[3:32:16] up you see these people
[3:32:19] here let me say this
[3:32:23] theth the poorest reg in
[3:32:28] [Music]
[3:32:29] Uganda
[3:32:33] how see many of
[3:32:39] don't down here in the center we used to
[3:32:41] think there are people who don't
[3:32:45] dress but when the message went
[3:32:48] there it changed their
[3:32:52] mindset and made them
[3:32:54] dress made them change many of the
[3:32:58] were here have
[3:33:02] changed and whenever I go
[3:33:05] to when we came
[3:33:07] to I've gone there many times remember I
[3:33:11] came with a brother from
[3:33:13] Canada how much money did he give you to
[3:33:15] arrange a
[3:33:18] meeting say the truth Pastor say the
[3:33:21] truth come here on the microphone you
[3:33:23] have to say the truth I'm sorry this is
[3:33:25] very
[3:33:27] important for these youth
[3:33:30] meetings sorry this is one of the major
[3:33:33] pastors there
[3:33:35] Hallelujah for us there how much do you
[3:33:38] receive for the Youth me for the
[3:33:39] meetings we arranged how much how much

[3:33:57] about that already yeah so so we were
[3:33:59] talking about um oh you thought it was
[3:34:02] the brother from Canada that gave you
[3:34:03] that money no it was not yeah yeah it's
[3:34:06] not we have that problem by the way I've
[3:34:08] helped some brethren here Loc
[3:34:11] yeah and after helping them they think a
[3:34:14] white man is the one who helped them
[3:34:16] through me that's a wrong mentality yeah
[3:34:19] we should change those things friends we
[3:34:21] are another
[3:34:23] generation we should take we should we
[3:34:25] should take the work of God into our
[3:34:27] hands and do it with all our hearts and
[3:34:29] with all our resources he wanted to say
[3:34:32] something yeah even for us in whatever

[3:36:09] h God bless
[3:36:12] you
[3:36:15] friends it is the end of that Spirit of
[3:36:22] begging now I've been misunderstood
[3:36:26] before I have been misunderstood
[3:36:29] before there is nothing
[3:36:31] wrong in me blessing a gift of money to
[3:36:34] Brother
[3:36:38] David is there anything wrong with that
[3:36:40] there is nothing wrong with him gifting
[3:36:42] me a gift of
[3:36:45] money if you want we are looking for
[3:36:47] money to buy our land
[3:36:50] brother yeah if you we receive
[3:36:55] it you understand we not going to beg
[3:36:58] for
[3:36:59] anything we are sons of God and message
[3:37:03] has made them who they are and this
[3:37:06] should make us who we are who what they
[3:37:09] they are also
[3:37:12] it should change us the message must
[3:37:15] Prosper
[3:37:17] us we must have Vision
[3:37:20] ourselves we must see what God is going
[3:37:22] to do if
[3:37:25] Hees we are the one going to do the work
[3:37:28] not going to move the
[3:37:30] gospel need money to do so where will it
[3:37:33] come
[3:37:34] from we must make the money we must
[3:37:38] believe
[3:37:39] God bless the work of our
[3:37:43] heart and so I don't believe in
[3:37:47] begging you're a Begg
[3:37:50] here help you so that you will stop
[3:37:53] begging
[3:37:54] permanent but
[3:37:57] you you know why we beg here in
[3:38:01] Africa because we don't
[3:38:04] give sincerely after arranging a meeting
[3:38:08] like
[3:38:09] this
[3:38:12] tell you spending
[3:38:18] 12,000 we asking
[3:38:23] you and then also register yourself so
[3:38:25] we can know you are
[3:38:29] coming and then you
[3:38:32] don't and then you simp show up and
[3:38:36] after showing up you I have
[3:38:39] nothing
[3:38:41] what is this mentality
[3:38:43] sincer I I believe I am not out of
[3:38:48] order talk
[3:38:50] this change this
[3:38:52] mentality should believe in
[3:38:56] ourselves I love is a good
[3:39:00] example I've learned a lot from
[3:39:06] Pastor it is a village by the way the
[3:39:08] church is in a village
[3:39:11] you know why I bring people there let
[3:39:13] me I want you to
[3:39:16] see that God can bless you whether you
[3:39:18] in the
[3:39:21] city they have a huge
[3:39:24] Church brother here bu it with his
[3:39:28] hands with other people in the
[3:39:31] church I'm telling heed of course the
[3:39:33] work he did not build by himself but
[3:39:35] heis but really it was a
[3:39:39] challenge and so friends I believe we
[3:39:42] should rise to the
[3:39:45] challenge and have the
[3:39:47] burden of supporting the work of
[3:39:51] God and so I was telling our
[3:39:55] team that next time if we ask you to
[3:39:58] register and you don't
[3:40:03] register ask
[3:40:05] you that to kindly go
[3:40:08] back because we are
[3:40:13] would we be
[3:40:15] bad let
[3:40:18] us God bless you the team from
[3:40:24] Nairobi naobi
[3:40:32] people this team
[3:40:35] fromi they all

[3:40:43] fee and they all PID their
[3:40:47] transport knew that they were coming
[3:40:49] long before they
[3:40:53] came that's why we are able to take care
[3:40:55] of them
[3:40:58] properly us emulate
[3:41:01] them God bless
[3:41:04] you for them so friends I'm sorry I had
[3:41:08] to take the time to say this it was
[3:41:10] really on my
[3:41:14] heart who he
[3:41:17] is anybody's
[3:41:21] feelings but I I I'm just saying the
[3:41:24] what is in my
[3:41:27] heart Pastor morus in
[3:41:30] ethopia this is what we taught in
[3:41:34] Ethiopia and this is what you

[3:41:43] also God is raising a generation
[3:41:46] friends that will take the work of God
[3:41:51] forward and we need toise the
