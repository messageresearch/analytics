[1:18:09] morning or this morning service
[1:18:14] some parts of the service I was having a
[1:18:16] tough time
[1:18:18] because I was saying brother Isaac don't
[1:18:21] go there
[1:18:24] please don't go there
[1:18:27] and he went there
[1:18:31] amen

[1:18:36] okay that's good amen
[1:18:39] and he'd go back around
[1:18:42] don't go there
[1:18:47] but the Lord has a purpose
[1:18:51] he has a purpose
[1:18:53] so maybe like a stamp
[1:18:57] [Music]
[1:18:58] and you put a stamp on the paper
[1:19:02] if you take
[1:19:06] time
[1:19:09] with just a little pressure

[1:19:19] so the image is there on the on the
[1:19:22] tablets of your heart this afternoon
[1:19:33] it might feel like the holy spirit is
[1:19:35] just putting a little more pressure
[1:19:42] what you heard this morning
[1:19:45] maybe you'll hear a little bit of the
[1:19:48] similar thought this evening

[1:22:51] the glory of man as the flower of grass
[1:22:53] the grass weareth and the flower thereof
[1:22:56] falleth away but the word of the Lord

[1:29:08] basketball and they attain us certain
[1:29:10] level
[1:29:12] where they become Elite
[1:29:19] nobody can match their ability
[1:29:29] they become a superstar
[1:29:31] and really Nothing is Stopping them in
[1:29:34] their careers
[1:29:41] they've got the the the the ability
[1:29:46] and it's enabled them to attain a
[1:29:48] certain level
[1:29:52] it almost
[1:29:55] almost
[1:30:17] they worship Him
[1:30:22] all right

[1:30:39] everybody gets a little bit quiet you're
[1:30:41] like whoa
[1:30:46] it's okay but what I'm trying to tell
[1:30:48] you is they have traits
[1:30:53] something inside of Messi
[1:30:57] has enabled him to attain a certain
[1:31:00] level
[1:31:02] all right whether it's in business
[1:31:06] business education
[1:31:09] Obama business
[1:31:13] whether it's an art in music
[1:31:18] there are people that attain the top
[1:31:21] will be in 12 years
[1:31:29] but there is one thing
[1:31:32] one thing
[1:31:34] that stops every one of them
[1:31:38] [Music]
[1:31:41] they might
[1:31:48] foreign every single one of them come to
[1:31:51] a point
[1:31:54] and death stops them in there
[1:31:56] [Music]
[1:31:59] not one of them
[1:32:04] they're stopped
[1:32:09] amen Amino and so man has searched

[1:32:17] for the the special uh you know drink
[1:32:22] that can bring them Eternal use
[1:32:28] man doesn't want to die
[1:32:32] so all through Humanity
[1:32:36] that's why there's
[1:32:39] two times
[1:32:43] of someone searching for the Fountain of
[1:32:46] youths
[1:32:51] because they're searching for something

[1:33:14] it's like a cup that has a liquid in it
[1:33:17] that would make you forever
[1:33:21] let's just put it simply they want
[1:33:24] eternal life
[1:33:30] man wants eternal life
[1:33:35] that's why they're obsessed with their
[1:33:37] superheroes yes
[1:33:43] maybe maybe not in Uganda

[1:34:53] we'll get there
[1:34:59] some new villain comes up some bad guy
[1:35:03] oh

[1:35:52] he can file like faster than speed of
[1:35:55] sound
[1:36:02] bullets hit him and bounce off
[1:36:10] that's why everybody's drawn to Superman
[1:36:12] yes Superman
[1:36:18] he's Unstoppable
[1:36:22] Amina
[1:36:24] you know how he draws his strength
[1:36:29] it's just what they say we're about to
[1:36:32] have a Gamba he flies up into the light
[1:36:36] of the sun

[1:36:45] and his body's able to sit the size
[1:36:48] energy
[1:36:52] and he's invincible
[1:36:56] and and Humanity loves him
[1:37:02] because something they're yearning for
[1:37:04] something
[1:37:08] they're Desiring those traits
[1:37:13] you're Desiring somehow there's got to
[1:37:16] be an invincibility somewhere

[1:37:46] it does existed
[1:37:52] they just haven't been looking in the
[1:37:54] right place
[1:38:03] let's look for it
[1:38:07] let's go back to a Garden of Eden
[1:38:09] cartoon
[1:38:12] where there was a time
[1:38:14] when one walked through a garden
[1:38:17] invincible
[1:38:27] but something happened
[1:38:31] a deformer stepped in
[1:38:36] his desire for a super ability
[1:38:41] scripture says how are thou fallen from
[1:38:43] heaven or Lucifer
[1:38:47] son of the morning
[1:38:50] how art thou cut down to the ground
[1:38:54] which did we kiss the Nations
[1:38:58] for thou has said in thine heart I

[1:40:36] [Music]
[1:40:41] he takes the Angels
[1:40:44] portion of them out of heaven
[1:40:49] and steps into the garden
[1:40:53] and deceives Eve
[1:40:57] brother Brandon says even before this

[2:10:17] so he thought he could put his finger on
[2:10:20] a fuse box
[2:10:23] turn on some lights and power here

[2:24:35] that is much greater that's been
[2:24:37] happening for six thousand years
[2:24:42] [Applause]
[2:24:44] and since the fall in the garden
[2:24:48] Satan has had a champion
[2:24:56] Called Death
[2:25:02] and Satan's champion of death
[2:25:06] has been in the ring with Humanity
[2:25:11] [Music]

[2:25:54] know
[2:25:55] Samson Samsung he was strong he was
[2:25:59] anointed with strength
[2:26:01] but he had to step into a ring with
[2:26:03] death
[2:26:05] and death
[2:26:08] probably became boring after a while
[2:26:13] no contest
[2:26:17] brother Brandon says last night we find
[2:26:21] out that the devil has a power
[2:26:23] and that power is death
[2:26:26] he said that he said he finished he said
[2:26:29] that's how he brought Moses right down
[2:26:32] all the children
[2:26:35] he said that's how he took Abel's lineup
[2:26:39] but God brought Seth back
[2:26:41] says and he's tried to kill all the
[2:26:44] children
[2:26:50] he said but there's no ever stopping
[2:26:53] God's program
[2:26:59] [Applause]
[2:27:00] amen so will you allow me just to maybe
[2:27:02] dramatize
[2:27:05] an event of time
[2:27:10] okay
[2:27:12] because something happened
[2:27:17] that day
[2:27:18] on Calvary
[2:27:22] Hallelujah
[2:27:25] the devil looked down and he said you
[2:27:27] think you're the Son of God
[2:27:30] he wondered because he threw up
[2:27:33] questions if there'll be
[2:27:36] if he was wondering
[2:27:39] is this really him is this who he says
[2:27:43] he is
[2:27:45] just not solid enough for me
[2:27:53] and he then cried it is finished
[2:27:59] and death stopped walked up
[2:28:01] [Music]
[2:28:07] foreign
[2:28:13] [Applause]
[2:28:21] but when he drew his arm back
[2:28:25] wow that was a little different
[2:28:29] he goes running back to Satan's
[2:28:31] headquarters
[2:28:33] he says uh
[2:28:37] something just happened
[2:28:40] the devil's like yeah what just happened
[2:28:42] well I was just there at Calvary
[2:28:45] and I gave the knockout punch of death
[2:28:48] it to that one called Jesus
[2:28:54] I don't know exactly it just kind of
[2:28:56] felt like my power just drained from me
[2:29:02] oh that's ridiculous
[2:29:05] what are you talking about
[2:29:12] [Applause]
[2:29:22] just just hold it right there
[2:29:25] someone's at the door go and answer that

[2:29:42] [Applause]
[2:29:42] um
[2:29:48] somebody stepped in the room
[2:29:52] because a prophecy would not be had gone

[2:30:14] so Jesus had no concern yes
[2:30:27] foreign
[2:30:52] [Music]

[2:31:09] and they said yeah well
[2:31:12] I thought I had you when I killed Abel
[2:31:16] I thought
[2:31:18] I promise
[2:31:31] and I thought I had it
[2:31:34] now with apple but then John the Baptist
[2:31:36] came
[2:31:38] and out I had to send death again
[2:31:48] but then you popped up

[2:31:56] are you really who you say you are yeah
[2:32:03] foreign
[2:32:20] [Music]
[2:32:44] but you had me wondering because you

[2:32:58] but the devil says but now
[2:33:01] now I've got you
[2:33:07] hey
[2:33:09] I think I think our Lord just left a
[2:33:11] little bit of time there for Satan to
[2:33:13] feel like he had the victory in other
[2:33:15] words
[2:33:20] foreign

[3:32:44] my Ministry and my believing was
[3:32:49] actually groomed by Brothers
[3:32:53] um because when we believed when I
[3:32:55] believe the message
[3:32:56] I I was I was very very intelligent
[3:33:02] and I thought I didn't want to be fooled
[3:33:05] so these people talking about a prophet
[3:33:08] from America
[3:33:11] what do I have to believe what what a
[3:33:14] white man has to say to me
[3:33:17] did the white people believe anyhow
[3:33:20] so I decided to go on the Internet
[3:33:23] and try and find out message
[3:33:27] other countries other than Africa
[3:33:30] and what they believe and what they
[3:33:32] preach
[3:33:33] at that time our pastor what they were
[3:33:35] what they would do they would just read
[3:33:37] from the message and explain to us
[3:33:41] but I wanted to know the source
[3:33:44] so when I searched the church I found
[3:33:47] was
[3:33:52] um and um there's another website also I
[3:33:55] found by the way it's a very good
[3:33:56] website
[3:34:01] um
[3:34:02] I do not remember anyway but uh
[3:34:08] it's a very good link I wish I would
[3:34:10] remember if I remember I'll let you know
[3:34:11] yeah it has a lot of information
[3:34:16] so there's a fellowship there in
[3:34:18] Newfoundland
[3:34:22] Newfoundland and the pasta there really
[3:34:25] had a burden to take the message out
[3:34:29] and his website on the internet was the
[3:34:32] very first about William Branham way
[3:34:35] besides
[3:34:38] and it's called William Branham
[3:34:40] homepage.org so if you go there it is
[3:34:49] so
[3:34:50] please I'm asking you even if you have
[3:34:53] your phone now write it down or if you
[3:34:54] have a paper write it down
[3:34:57] he has a lot of information
[3:35:00] about the message
[3:35:02] William Branham
[3:35:03] [Music]
[3:35:08] homepage.org William Branham home page
[3:35:15] so when I when I searched on that
[3:35:17] website I was so enthused
[3:35:20] um
[3:35:25] information
[3:35:28] this other one I found videos of
[3:35:31] preachings
[3:35:33] and they saw this old man preaching on
[3:35:36] fire
[3:35:37] he was like on fire because if he was
[3:35:40] stepping on the stones of fire
[3:35:44] and I was like but I want I want what
[3:35:47] this old man has
[3:35:49] foreign
[3:36:05] because he was preaching something that
[3:36:08] he seemed to really
[3:36:10] know about
[3:36:11] Dallas
[3:36:13] and I'm actually encouraging I'm saying
[3:36:16] this because I know you you're going to
[3:36:18] go and search these things out
[3:36:21] you go and search brother Eddie biscuit
[3:36:24] Ministry in the testimony
[3:36:28] on the internet internet YouTube you can
[3:36:32] find it I believe
[3:36:34] he gives a first-hand testimony
[3:36:39] of his life of his time with the prophet
[3:36:43] and how he learned that he that brother
[3:36:45] was Elijah yeah
[3:36:49] how many I believe
[3:36:53] amen those who don't know about what I'm
[3:36:55] talking about you can come and let us
[3:36:57] know
[3:37:03] so I would like to go in in much detail
[3:37:05] because of time
[3:37:07] but brother Eddie has
[3:37:10] evangelized in a lot of countries
[3:37:16] and like I said brother Michael is a
[3:37:18] grandson to brother but
[3:37:25] he is not preaching because he's a
[3:37:26] grandson of other end
[3:37:30] he knows what he's talking about
[3:37:34] amen and uh I was thinking as brother Ed
[3:37:37] went in Malawi and other African
[3:37:39] countries and India
[3:37:43] um
[3:37:48] now also doing the same
[3:37:52] so I I don't know Brothers you you can
[3:37:55] tell me how many uh Brethren
[3:37:57] visits
[3:38:05] but uh brother Michael was willing to go
[3:38:08] and we are going to be visiting most of
[3:38:11] the part we're going to be in yeah
[3:38:15] and they're going to be there not just
[3:38:17] to preach we're going to be there for an
[3:38:19] entire week doing uh the work of the
[3:38:22] Lord
[3:38:25] so we ask for your prayers
[3:38:31] pray for brother Michael that God will
[3:38:35] give him Supernatural
