[54:25] think it is in the South I'm not too
[54:27] sure

[54:31] we took meetings to the same meetings we
[54:34] preached at the same meetings in Kampala
[54:35] some I think last year

[54:41] each other

[54:46] with a brother mahere he asked us to
[54:48] send greetings to yourself
[54:52] amen so we are taking uh the reading
[54:56] from Matthew 27 verse 62 Matthew 27 62
[55:02] I appreciate pastor mandurah we had a
[55:04] wonderful time at Zimmer Park uh
[55:08] even and uh brother Gideon in Ethiopia
[55:11] we also were in Ethiopia before so uh
[55:14] brother Solomon I think yes uh but the
[55:16] Gideon was asking me you need to go to
[55:18] Pastor Solomon's and one brother told me
[55:20] he would be the meetings here so the
[55:22] Saints uh I believe are here so we have
[55:24] also visited
[55:33] so we're reading from verses 62.62
[55:43] we will read up to verses 66.66.
[55:52] now the next day
[55:54] that followed
[56:01] excuse me read that again now the next
[56:03] day that followed the day of the
[56:05] preparation the chief priests and the
[56:07] Pharisees came together onto pirate
[56:10] saying so we remember that the deceiver
[56:14] said while he was yet alive after three
[56:18] days I will raise again
[56:21] commander of Father decepaka be made
[56:24] sure until the third day lest his
[56:27] disciples come by night and steal him
[56:30] away and say unto the people he is risen
[56:33] from the dead
[56:34] so the last era shall be worse than the
[56:38] first
[56:39] pilate said unto them ye have a watch go
[56:43] your way make it as sure as you can
[56:46] so they went and made the sepulchan sure
[56:49] sealing the stone and setting a watch
[57:01] ing
[57:08] it is
[57:34] Lord Jesus well for a few moments we are
[57:36] speaking into the patches of your blood
[57:38] I ask that you will come and let your
[57:39] Holy Spirit come and take control now we
[57:41] invite you in this place in Jesus name
[57:43] amen may be seated
[57:49] I would like to greet you all in the
[57:50] precious name of Jesus Christ
[57:54] do you mind coming stand with me brother
[57:58] amen
[58:01] I think you can come he can come up here
[58:03] and we preach together
[58:07] amen so uh my subject to you this
[58:09] morning is No Grave can hold you
[58:15] No Grave can hold you
[58:17] tell your neighbor No Grave can hold you
[58:20] Hallelujah
[58:23] you see Jesus Is Our Savior yes when the
[58:26] importance we're doing but we also know
[58:28] that Jesus was God in flesh
[58:31] God himself had come to visit uh to not
[58:34] only this but he had come to uh change
[58:37] the destiny of mankind
[58:41] and when he came down
[58:44] he came down with a sure walk
[58:48] you know there are many people who go
[58:50] into business
[58:52] and they're not too sure about the
[58:54] business
[58:56] and so many of those businesses end up
[58:58] failing
[59:01] because they did not maybe count the
[59:03] cost
[59:05] They Don't Know What It Takes or what it
[59:08] took to be able to succeed in that
[59:09] business
[59:11] but our God is Not Like a Man anymore
[59:15] our God is always sure about all his
[59:17] businesses
[59:19] and when he came down he came down on a
[59:23] short day
[59:38] and so today the whole world is
[59:40] remembering the death and barrier and
[59:42] resurrection of Jesus Christ
[59:47] and I was thinking about Jesus
[59:50] how when he came down on us
[59:53] you know he
[59:55] knew what he was going to do
[59:58] but he you know as a man he was fearful
[1:00:03] you know we believe that Jesus is God
[1:00:06] how many believe that
[1:00:08] Jesus is God Jesus 100 God but also
[1:00:13] Jesus was man 100
[1:00:16] so when he came down he was in human
[1:00:20] flesh and the Bible says he was found in
[1:00:23] a fashion as a man
[1:00:25] anymore and so he humbled himself
[1:00:28] the death even of the Cross
[1:00:31] but he was fearful just like you and me
[1:00:34] but you know there is one thing that was
[1:00:37] sure
[1:00:38] if Jesus was going to go through that
[1:00:41] Journey
[1:00:42] if Jesus was going to die
[1:00:45] if Jesus was going to be buried
[1:00:48] there was one thing sure
[1:00:51] that the grave could no longer hold him
[1:00:56] he was sure about that he wasn't fearful
[1:01:00] about
[1:01:01] [Music]
[1:01:30] hallelujah amen and so when he died you
[1:01:33] know the whole story of how you know the
[1:01:35] suffering and the beating and everything
[1:01:39] and so then he comes to the place
[1:01:43] when now he was buried
[1:01:49] he actually went all the way to hell
[1:01:52] again
[1:01:55] his death foreign
[1:02:54] uh let me let me not talk about hell so
[1:02:57] much today because I'm talking about the
[1:02:58] grave
[1:02:59] so he went away from the grave
[1:03:04] while he was there in the grave
[1:03:07] the devil thought he could hold him
[1:03:10] the devil was walking through men
[1:03:14] who thought they were religious
[1:03:17] men who thought they knew what they were
[1:03:20] talking about
[1:03:21] who thought they had phds in theology
[1:03:27] religion for years and years
[1:03:31] and so they came and advised actually it
[1:03:36] was the Pharisees that came to Pilates
[1:03:39] you read the Bible again verse 62 it
[1:03:42] says the chief priests and the Pharisees
[1:03:46] they came to Pilots
[1:03:49] religion and politics United together
[1:03:56] and they said do you remember what the
[1:03:58] deceiver said
[1:04:00] while he was yet alive
[1:04:03] he said after three days he will rise
[1:04:06] again
[1:04:07] can you imagine the religious
[1:04:12] they called our savior
[1:04:17] this is what they are calling him again
[1:04:19] in our generation yeah
[1:04:24] they are calling him the deceiver
[1:04:26] by rejecting this message
[1:04:29] they are calling him the deceiver by
[1:04:33] rejecting what God has done in Our
[1:04:34] Generations
[1:04:37] but let me tell you do the Believers who
[1:04:41] know the truth
[1:04:42] I know he's not a deceiver we know he's
[1:04:46] a faithful Savior we know it's a
[1:04:49] faithful one and true one
[1:04:51] and every word he says
[1:04:53] will surely come to pass
[1:04:56] how many I believe that you are not
[1:04:59] saying that well don't wait for me to
[1:05:01] begin preaching you better preach with
[1:05:03] me by saying amen
[1:05:06] amen I know this is the first meeting
[1:05:09] hallelujah amen I'm not waiting for
[1:05:12] music to warm me up
[1:05:14] I'm already warmed up by the word
[1:05:18] so if you want me to preach to you to
[1:05:20] this morning
[1:05:21] forget about everything else
[1:05:24] foreign
[1:05:27] [Music]
[1:06:14] [Applause]
[1:06:24] foreign
[1:06:36] [Music]
[1:07:31] and that's why we can never leave the
[1:07:33] message
[1:07:35] because the message is true
[1:07:39] tell your neighbor the message is true
[1:07:41] the other part will be married
[1:07:44] and so they said you know he said that
[1:07:47] after three days
[1:07:52] after three days that he said he would
[1:07:55] rise up again
[1:07:56] and he said commands United States
[1:08:01] [Music]
[1:08:07] foreign
[1:08:27] they did not know he was not going to
[1:08:30] come out as a dead body
[1:08:33] he was going to come out alive
[1:08:41] that's why some people who love crucifix
[1:08:45] on the crucified
[1:08:49] yes sometimes they put a body there
[1:08:53] a dead body
[1:08:55] but our savior
[1:08:58] our savior is alive he came out of the
[1:09:02] grave
[1:09:03] and so they said you go and secure it is
[1:09:14] disciples come by night and steal him
[1:09:17] away
[1:09:18] the same people you know they will say
[1:09:22] that he is risen from the day
[1:09:24] and so the first the last era will be
[1:09:27] worse than
[1:09:31] who do you think this was
[1:09:33] [Music]
[1:09:41] [Music]
[1:09:50] [Music]
[1:09:59] but I wanted to hear what the prophet
[1:10:01] says
[1:10:04] in a message you go tell my disciples
[1:10:08] Hallelujah
[1:10:09] all right I'll just first read the same
[1:10:12] yesterday and forever
[1:10:14] Faith takes this place right there
[1:10:19] can't check it away
[1:10:28] because the word of God said I will not
[1:10:31] leave my soul in Hell notice
[1:10:39] there is
[1:10:44] I just wanted to take a moment and think
[1:10:46] about it
[1:10:48] doesn't matter how strong the grave was
[1:10:52] it doesn't matter how good you know it
[1:10:55] was protected
[1:10:56] and what seal was on there

[1:24:05] opinion
[1:24:12] am I preaching to someone here this
[1:24:14] morning
[1:24:16] how can we be in the graves
[1:24:20] those Graves may not be physical Graves
[1:24:24] people many Christians are in spiritual
[1:24:27] Graves
[1:24:29] and we live below our Privileges
[1:24:33] and we let the devil bury Us in those
[1:24:36] Graves
[1:24:37] let me tell you some Believers even are
[1:24:40] in the graves of property
[1:24:44] but for us we say we are believers of
[1:24:46] the message yeah
[1:24:51] [Music]
[1:24:58] because the Bible says we should we
[1:25:02] should be heads and not tails
[1:25:05] and it is more blessed to do what to
[1:25:08] give than to receive
[1:25:11] how can you give what you don't have
[1:25:15] Jennifer I'm here to tell you why is the
[1:25:18] pride of Christ
[1:25:19] not accept any conditions
[1:25:23] of what the promises we have in the
[1:25:26] world
[1:25:29] if it is not like what the promises
[1:25:41] [Music]
[1:25:58] which the devil can't keep in the grave
[1:26:25] and they become depressed and oppressed
[1:26:28] by demons
[1:26:30] and you know they go over the same thing
[1:26:32] you know like a cycle
[1:26:36] the devil is very good at attacking us
[1:26:40] he will say believe what you want to
[1:26:42] believe
[1:26:43] as far as your life is concerned I am in
[1:26:47] control so you find many Believers
[1:26:52] not living in the life of the world

[1:32:16] and I did not ever think of something
[1:32:19] better
[1:32:20] but because I was a seed of God
[1:32:23] God brought me this message

[1:39:26] stories it doesn't look like it is
[1:39:28] but I hope you Brethren will be
[1:39:31] spiritual enough to believe that God
[1:39:32] does Miracles
[1:39:36] when I arrived in the church
[1:39:39] I found my mother
[1:39:42] I didn't invite her
[1:39:44] I didn't tell her anything
[1:39:47] they were no longer talking
[1:39:50] and the pastor in that church preached
[1:39:52] Pastor
[1:39:54] that's why preachers let us preach
[1:39:57] and those demons which one to stop
[1:39:59] preachers from preaching
[1:40:01] let me tell you those as our other
[1:40:03] Graves
[1:40:05] yes I'm speaking that fearing because
[1:40:09] it's the word of God
[1:40:10] God has sent us to preach the gospel
[1:40:16] and that's what creatures do those
[1:40:20] and so that preacher preached
[1:40:24] and
[1:40:32] she started looking around
[1:40:35] when she turned like this
[1:40:37] she was like shocked to see me
[1:40:42] take me to the front
[1:40:48] I said oh my God
[1:40:51] and you know
[1:40:53] I took I took a hold of my mother
[1:40:59] and we walked slowly
[1:41:02] to the Altar and when we reached there I
[1:41:06] left Saturday and I ran back
[1:41:09] in my heart I was like the angel the
[1:41:11] Lord has arrested
[1:41:15] amen hallelujah amen God still does the
[1:41:20] same thing
[1:41:22] if you have Hallelujah I'm challenging

[1:41:29] and family

[1:41:36] they may be drunkards they may be in
[1:41:40] living a life of sin
[1:41:42] be out there in the world
[1:41:49] if you believe something and you ask God
[1:41:52] to do something right now
[1:41:54] God's Great will hold them no more
[1:41:58] will have no choice
[1:42:08] my mother gave her life to Jesus
[1:42:14] I am by selling the same woman who
[1:42:17] disowned me
[1:42:20] let me tell you God can do the same for
[1:42:23] your loved ones
[1:42:25] we live for it right now
[1:42:28] confess it right now
[1:42:30] yes while we remember the resurrection
[1:42:33] of Jesus

[1:42:38] ones out of God's grace

[1:42:59] right now he says you are going to say
[1:43:02] testimonies you are going to hear
[1:43:04] testimony because that's what our God
[1:43:07] does
[1:43:09] he came to set those who are in prison
[1:43:11] free
[1:43:15] amen
[1:43:18] yes
[1:43:20] Hallelujah
[1:43:23] and right there
[1:43:24] said unto Jesus
[1:43:27] if thou Art's been here my brother had
[1:43:30] not died
[1:43:33] will ask of God God will give it to them
[1:43:39] my brother shall rise again
[1:43:43] [Music]
[1:43:45] mother said unto him
[1:43:47] I know that he shall rise again in the
[1:43:49] Resurrection on that at that last day
[1:43:53] now I'm not talking about coming out of
[1:43:55] the Grave
[1:43:57] we're talking about now
[1:44:02] I'm talking about now
[1:44:05] Jesus
[1:44:07] oh my God this is a this is a missile
[1:45:10] the message is
[1:45:13] there is something I'm coming through
[1:45:15] here now
[1:45:16] Jesus is not here in his physical form
[1:45:20] that we are saying that this is Jesus
[1:45:24] but you need to understand first of all
[1:45:27] who is Jesus
[1:45:35] and I want to tell you that will die as
[1:45:37] I already shortly for you here
[1:45:40] the end time message
[1:45:42] is Christo
[1:45:46] is somebody getting the revelation
[1:45:48] [Music]
[1:45:49] not Christ Cristo is the resurrection
[1:45:52] and the life no opinion so am I right to
[1:45:56] say
[1:45:57] it is the resurrection
[1:46:03] says we are not to come together to talk
[1:46:07] about the message
[1:46:10] we have not come here to talk about the
[1:46:14] message we have come together
[1:46:16] get in the
[1:46:19] oh
[1:46:20] [Applause]
[1:47:15] he said
[1:47:19] my brother had not died
[1:47:22] when Jesus
[1:47:25] and the Jews also weeping which came
[1:47:27] with her
[1:47:29] he groaned in the spirit
[1:47:33] and was troubled and said well have you
[1:47:37] laid him they said unto him Lord he said
[1:47:41] come and see where morning
[1:47:45] I believe this is whatever the believer
[1:47:47] ought to do this
[1:47:49] we don't need to behave like or act like
[1:47:52] holier than that
[1:47:55] I think what the preacher's talking
[1:47:57] about is for the other one
[1:47:59] um
[1:48:00] you're dead
[1:48:02] foreign
[1:48:30] foreign
[1:48:47] [Music]
[1:48:55] come and see my grave and Jesus weaked
[1:48:59] you know something about Jesus
[1:49:02] he always understands
[1:49:07] there's a song that some brothers or
[1:49:10] some people sang
[1:49:11] there is a storm Within Me rages
[1:49:15] I don't know if I remember the words
[1:49:17] very well
[1:49:18] it goes like this
[1:49:21] [Music]
[1:49:22] [Applause]
[1:49:25] it was against my soul
[1:49:29] Hallelujah
[1:49:31] and then the other words I don't
[1:49:32] remember but it says and then it ends
[1:49:35] like saying for you always understand
[1:49:41] never was
[1:49:43] quit loving me down
[1:49:47] [Music]
[1:49:50] your faithfulness amen
[1:50:06] [Music]
[1:50:13] our father always understands
[1:50:16] Jesus wept that's the shortest verse in
[1:50:20] the whole Bible
[1:50:23] he's a high priest s
[1:50:33] you may have
[1:50:35] backslided in some ways
[1:50:40] that's a grave
[1:50:42] but Jesus understands he has the power
[1:50:46] to take you out but first I want to show
[1:50:49] you he understands
[1:51:01] let them testify
[1:51:04] let them testify
[1:51:06] that Jesus loves us
[1:51:10] Hallelujah
[1:51:12] and some of them said could not this man
[1:51:16] which opened the eyes of the blind have
[1:51:18] caused that even this man should not
[1:51:21] have died
[1:51:27] whenever Jesus is going to do something
[1:51:30] he first waits for the critics to say
[1:51:32] something
[1:51:36] while I'm talking these words I want you
[1:51:38] to examine your life
[1:51:43] before Jesus does something
[1:51:45] he waits for the critics to say
[1:51:48] something
[1:51:50] somehow he enjoys that
[1:51:52] he enjoys that
[1:51:54] because when the critics speak
[1:51:57] it gives him even a better reason to act
[1:52:01] you know
[1:52:02] to show himself that is a living God
[1:52:08] he left the Romans
[1:52:12] imagine that they brought the whole
[1:52:15] Machinery of the Roman army
[1:52:18] Roma who saw them that day
[1:52:21] when they were bringing the sale
[1:52:24] and they were putting
[1:52:26] them and bringing the soldiers
[1:52:32] blessing them everywhere
[1:52:41] you know give them to some Lions to eat
[1:52:43] them
[1:52:44] they left them to do all that they could
[1:52:47] he left them to you know to to to ashame
[1:52:51] themselves
[1:52:52] so that he can move
[1:52:55] and the same way
[1:52:58] he left everybody to speak what they
[1:53:01] were speaking
[1:53:02] while he was getting ready to move
[1:53:05] you have to be in this condition
[1:53:08] dead stinking
[1:53:11] in order for his name to be glorified
[1:53:16] Jesus therefore again verse 38 groaning
[1:53:18] in himself coming to the Grave
[1:53:23] it was a cave and a stone lay upon it is
[1:53:33] taking away the storm beside Hebrew
[1:53:36] Master the sister of him that was dead
