You &gt;&gt; can turn around and greet your neighbor, your brother, your sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I want to turn to our Bible and we shall read in the book of uh chapter 2 vers three. on your Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For the vision is yet for an appointed time. &gt;&gt; But at the but at the end it shall speak and not lie. Though it tight for it because it will surely come to pass. It will not t. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh then we read also in the book of uh you're reading another scripture in &gt;&gt; the book of Ecclesiastes uh chapter 3. Yeah, it's very uh uh common scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Chapter 3 8. Mm. Mhm. Yes. Fore speech. for let us pray our heavenly loving father. Lord, we thank you, for this evening, for the word we have read this evening. But we pray you come speak to us, oh God. The Bible tells us that you're the God of all flesh. And he said, "And man shall not live by bread alone, but every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God, that you may come and do as you want full prep minutes in this ministry. Thank you for you've desired it. In the name of Jesus, we have prayed. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. May have your seats. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This evening, &gt;&gt; I have something that I want us to share. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will call it &gt;&gt; uh anon time god. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what I want us to talk about tonight. Praise be to God. Amen. And where we have read We saw in Habacook where God is instructing him to write the vision. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And here where we have read, we are seeing the Bible is telling us something. It's talking about seasons. He's talking about time for everything. Time for sowing, time for reaping, time for loving, and time for hating. Many times this scripture is read uh in funerals. Blessed be the name of the Lord. But today I want us to take it take another direction and I want us to talk about on time God. Blessed be the name of the Lord. God who is never too late who is never on hurry. He will not rush but he always comes on time. Blessed be the name of the Lord and that is the God we are serving. He has never been too late in any situation. Praise be to God. God is not controlled by time. He is not like us for us. We are creatures of time. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And most time many times we look at time that time factor and you hear them say time is money time wastage never recover you're wasting a lot of time blessed be the name of the Lord. It is because we are precious of time. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. But when it comes to God, Hebrews 13:8 tells us that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday is the same today and forever. It's only God who is the I am. Amen. Ever present God. Blessed be the name of the Lord. It's God who knows everything. It's God who sees everything. It's God who is even in next year from eternity to eternity is God. Praise be to God. Amen. That is the God we are serving. Blessed be the name of the Lord. He's the God of his word. His word cannot get old. It can't expire. It's always fresh. is always up to date. Blessed be the name of the Lord. When he spoke in Isaiah about the virgin birth, how the virgin shall conceive to bring forth a son. His name will be called, wonderful counselor, the mighty God, everlasting father. Praise be to God. Amen. It took many many years but it came to pass humanly speaking it was quite many years I think over 600 years. Praise be to God. Amen. But it came to pass. It never in fact it never delayed according to God's timing. It was just on time when Jesus was born. He was born in the right time. Praise be to God. And he never delayed. That was that was God's appointed time. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm here to tell you this evening, our God is on time God. Whatever comes our way, whatever happens to us, Amen. It just happen in the exact time. That is the right time of that situation for that thing to happen. Amen. And God is watching it. And God knows it. He knows that it will happen. Praise be to God. Remember on Sunday, pastor was giving us a testimony about our land fund, how we used to do it and how he was inspired and how the things work. That was God's appointed time to work. And the same is happens in our life. Many time we have a lot of complaint because things are not working out the way we would wish. But I'm here to encourage you. Amen. God is just on time. It is not too late. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Because the Bible tells us in just a day with the Lord a thousand years is equivalent to one day and one day is equivalent to a thousand years. So we are counting 2025. God is counting two days. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God always come on time. Whatever God does, always happen on time. Amen. Praise be to God. So whatever is happening around us, where we are today, the day we are living in, Praise be to God. As being in this generation, it's not a mistake. We are just here on the right time and we are the right vessel, the right candidate for this time. Blessed be the name of the Lord. The situation you are in tonight, the things you are battling with, God knows about them. Hallelujah. But in God's appointed time, is going to work it out for you are good. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want us to see things different way. Let us see the way God is seeing it. Let us judge it the way God is judging us. God uses his word. Praise be to God. All the promise he gave us in his word, it cannot fail that it will come to pass in God's appointed time. Praise be to God. Remember the Bible tells us whatever we desire when we pray, we believe and we shall have it. He never see that whatever you desire when you pray, you now have it. Faithically speaking, faith you have it. But you say whatever thing we desire when we pray we believe and we shall have it. Amen. So many time we are prayed for and maybe you are sick and you go home and you're still sick and you're like I just not but he said you believe he said whatever thing you desire when you pray believe and you shall have it. As long as faith is there, much as you have not seen it, it's there. Just keep believing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, maybe he didn't mean it. Those were days of Jesus. Whatever thing you desire, When you believe, you already have it. Hallelujah. Not feeling it, you already have it. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So the God we serve on time God. He he answers our prayers just on time. When David was being anointed They thought David was young. Maybe even some thought that the prophet has wasted that anointing. How can you anoint this little boy? What is he going to do? Yet we are here giants, well trained armor officers. Blessed be the name of God. But that was God's God was not making any mistake. He knew what he was doing and he was doing it on time. Blessed be the name of the Lord because when you read that scripture, you'll realize uh in uh 1 Samuel From the time David was anointed to the time he killed Goliath, &gt;&gt; it was not long period. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That David was being anointed and maybe they thought he was young. He could not do anything. But God, Amen. He was preparing him to face Goliath the other side. And the Bible tells us Goliath that challenged Israelite for 40 years. Praise be to God. Amen. But there is a little boy anointed for maybe just few weeks who is going to put him down. Why? Because it was God's appointed time. That was the right time for the job. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. So our God is an ontime God. Praise be to God. If we look at our lives, Well, there are things you are battling with. You have battled with it for so long, maybe for years, maybe two years, maybe 8 months or 10 years until you feel like you feel like giving up. Maybe God is not mindful about. But I'm here to tell you, I'm here to give you another report. That is not what God is saying. He knows what you're going through. He's washing it. &gt;&gt; He's seeing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going to come just on time and that habit will vanish away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Many time we want to hurry God. We want to quicken God. People who act like catisting the reaction is not our God. God is not creature of time. He's an eternal God. Amen. From everlasting to everlasting is God. So he worked his way. He has his own pace. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see even in our daily life you can't join primary level today and then tomorrow you are sitting for primary leading exam but you have to follow all the procedures. You go through all the lower classes first classes then you go to higher institution of amen. And I believe that's how God works. He has his own time. Each one of us, we have our own time. And when that time reaches, nothing can stop that process. Stop that growth. Hallelujah. However much the devil, it will become unstoppable. Hallelujah. Amen. Why? Because it is God's time. God's time to work. God's time to operate. Frustration will have to obey. Amen. If it is cancer, it will have to go away because this the master's time. It is the first time for everyone. Blessed be the name of the Lord. But one thing we have to do Let us keep believing the word, keep standing in the word. Praise be to God. When it is God's time, no matter how hard things look to be, thing will have to give way. Blessed be the name of God. I was reading a quote. Brother was talking about uh uh a brethren who saw something in a cocoon and then they kind of wanted to help it. How many know? Yes, there are stages of uh some insects [Music] they go through stages maybe two maybe three egg then the l stage. Yeah. If you look at livestock of butterfly. Amen. It has I think has those three stages. The first one the egg then the lover then after that lover will make a cocoon [Music] preparing for another stage and it can be there for I think even for a month until you may think that there is no life in there. I remember when we were young, we used to stuff those cocoons, but when you tear it out, you realize there are some worms inside. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Then after cocoon, nothing will burst into a butterfly. Praise be to God. And even in our life, in our Christian world, There is a time you reach and you think you are not progressing and you think you have done everything but it's like there's no result. Brother sisters, something is happening because it's not your working, it is the working of God, it is God working it out. Amen. And say if they remove that thing out of that in case it survive it will not have strength. I remember when I was young and we had a we had a hen which was hatching and after it was done normally there are those eggs which remained behind but if you shake them you hear chick crying in so what we used to do like cotton and you cover it with cotton most time After the head has hatched majority of the egg, they tend to ignore whether some chicks are crying there. It doesn't matter. But if you try to force that chick out of that in most cases will not even last for two days. And yet there are others will last. grow and even produce more needs. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Why? Because God has his own providing. So for you, for us many time praying that we are helping God. We are worsening the situation. Amen. But let God arrive on his own time, brother. Nothing will hinder God. Nothing will stand on our way. Amen. Amen. Because our boss has arrived. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So that is the God we are serving. We at the moment we are seeing how things are. And if you look at it physically speaking, it's like things are down. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; But I also believe this is God's appointed time for us to take a step. Amen. And because this God's appointed time, it's God's right time, we are seeing something is happening. Amen. There is something going on both in the spiritual and the physical. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So don't be scared. Don't worry because things are tough. Because you are battling with a habit to come and sit in the service. If you get out of the church, you already under bondage again. Brother, sister, there's nothing you can do over that. The only thing you have to do, let God. Let go and let God handle it. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Because God knows it. One thing that encourages me most to know that I'm not here for my own somebody's property. I belong to a God who created heavens and earth. Amen. Say as long as you are still breathing, there is chance. Amen. As long as you are still alive, brother, you are still progressing. You are still pressing on. You are still moving forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you find yourself alive that God has given you grace, don't mourn. Don't be discouraged. Amen. Amen. But tell God since she have gave me another chance. I am pressing on the upward way. Amen. Amen. Every single day, the bride is pressing the upward way. We are not going the backward way. He found us when we are going the downward way. He changed our destiny. He showed us the right path. Let's have it on the right way. And from that time &gt;&gt; we are moving forward. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message the footprint on the son of child time. It talks of a brother. This brother he saw a vision. Oh it was a dream how he was walking with the Lord. But there is where when he reached the hard the hardship she ship he honors his one footprint. Blessed be the name of the Lord. I say this is being unfair. When things are okay I'm seeing two foot but when things are tough I'm only seeing one foot. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And you know what the answer was? When you reached there, it was me walking. I was carrying you on my path. Blessed be the name of the Lord. That is the God we are serving. When we reach a sharp edge, when we reach a razor edge, the Lord carries us on his back and he walks alone. Praise be to God. And when we when we reach where you can walk, he puts you down. So let us walk together. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So many time during that time of silence. It is because you are not hearing anything because somebody is scaring you. Somebody's working for you. Somebody's working out something for you. Blessed be the name of the Lord. That is the God we are serving. He always has come on time. Praise be to God where we read in Habac. He says write the vision put it on the wall it will. Amen. when he says it will t and again he came back and said it will not it will come to pass whatever thing God has promised us it may seem that has taken long time but brother sister is just on the way amen he said we shall possess the gates of our enemies No matter what comes our way, that word is turning night and day of our we are possessors and we must possess because it was declared. It was decreed and that's what we are. Possession is in our DNA. Victory is in our DNA. Hallelujah. Amen. Healing is part of us in seven language. Praise be to God. Your body is made up of all these things. Yes sir. It's made up of vision, healing, love, peace, meekiness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It take the Holy Ghost to quicken those elements for us to see it working. Blessed be the name of the Lord. The very God who promised and said he shall t but it will not turn. It will come to pass. Hallelujah. Amen. when it tries because we are looking at it in a human way. Yes, there it is. But according to God's way of working, it has not taken long brother. It is just yesterday. It is just here. Praise be to God. When God promised the birth of Christ to prophet Isaiah after he declared, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, the priest of them days, he was going Jesus was going to be born in the king's palace. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we believe that virgins were preserved maybe parents could tell their children, "Oh my daughter, there is this promise." We started reading it before even your father. And I believe that day. I think boys were H sorry the girls were the ones when you give birth to a boy those days when you give birth to a son you say I've missed to give birth to the virgin that will give birth to the Messiah praise be to God &gt;&gt; and we believe they reserve they preserved them according to their of doing things. The prophecy took over 600 years according to a human way of seeing things. According to God's way, it was not even a day. Praise be to God. How many do you think waited? We have waited. We have read these things in the archive in the library. 100 years, 200 years, 500 years. Praise be to God. That was according to their timing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But when God's time arrived, oh brother, sister. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One day, Mary was somewhere. She was doing some work somewhere. She had a visitation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The time had arrived. Angel came at the wrong time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe that day many woke up differently. Yeah. Because even the rapture when we are going, the Bible says some of us will not take us unaware. shall know his homegoing time and we shall start gathering. We will be seeing the saints. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bitters. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Those brethren who died who rested in the Lord and we shall know your sister. I will tell my wife my dear Winnie going time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Although my wife will be the one to tell me because if you read the Bible most time it is sisters who have many angel of visitation maybe we come back from the from work. I tell him my dear I saw Sah I I will ask you mean Sah our daughter? Oh, the son of the Bible. Have you ever seen your say? Oh, yes. And maybe when I still be I will be there asking questions. You look like both said you are right. It's going time. Praise be to God. I believe Mary that day. Oh brother or sister, &gt;&gt; maybe she woke up singing a song of the redemption story. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, it was there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother says, "No man is is in his right mind until receive Christ." When they hear us saying these things, they think we are just playing around. Brother, sister, amen. That morning or that afternoon, the hand of his lady Mary, it was God's appointed time. Amen. It never even took God one day. It took God a half day. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the word outside the religious men of them days of that day for them to say this thing is taking [Music] we have saved these girls. Let them get you saved the virgins. They are only God had a special one. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Mary was in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. And again, she was the one &gt;&gt; to bring forth the Messiah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. I trust the angels were watching the calendar. Amen. And that morning, God did not have to remind Gabriel that go and deliver the message. He knew his assignment. Praise be to God. And here on time, he came down. Today brethren, today we are seeing confusion in message churches, denomination, in the world. We are hearing words funny things happening in churches until sometime you feel like you want to be discouraged. But if I ask you a question this evening, you mean God is not seeing that. God is seeing it, brother, sister. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He knows how to handle that. And just on time, hallelujah, he's going to do reshuffle. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Just cling to the word. Let us move forward. Let us lay aside every weight to the sin that was easily set. Let us look into the word of God. And let us know that we are just here on the right time. Amen. That you are the bride of Christ. Blessed be the name of the Lord. talk of Hebrew children when they going to be cast into the fire. I believe it was not the first time for them to see somebody being cast in that. They knew very well how it was how it consumes because they were there for many years and remember those days punishment was punishment. Either you obey the law or you are killed. They knew what that fire could do. Praise be to God. But they knew their promise. They were updated with Daniel's prophet. Hallelujah. And they knew their time was ded. Yes, sir. And the king to instill warfare in them. He commanded it to be uh to be multiplied seven times. Blessed be the name of the Lord. But the prophet says that God came into the fire and removed that flame that removed that burning element in the fire. [Music] And the king saw his guys in fire and they were not being consumed. What happened? God came on time. He quenched the violence of fire. Praise be to God. My brother, my sister, is an on time God. He will always come to us on time. Are you battling with something? You have something waited so long. God is going to come on time. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let us just keep moving. Do you know that even the devil is not affected by time? Yes. It's only us who bypass our theophony. the one who could say time. [Music] I'm getting all this. I'm finished. What can I do? &gt;&gt; Then when you go to the mirror, it magnifies the problem. You even forget to look at what is in your bag on your eyes. You look at the wrinkles on your beard &gt;&gt; and you start struggling with it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because creatures of time and because the devil knows that that puts us on pressure. If the devil is not on pressure, he's not been affected by time. Yes, the devil works night and day. He has worked for 2,000 years. Even right now, he's working. And if you're not careful, he's even ministering to you somewhere there. You feel that you are tired by the what is what what what is the time? The brother is not finished. is ever on job. &gt;&gt; It is only us who many times I am 50 years. Why should I marry children? My children will call me grandpa. How many grandpas have died? How many people have been called grandpa and because they aged so they died pressure and fear. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You want to tell me that God who created you, if you look at the mystery of birth, out of millions and millions of your brothers and sisters, you managed to cross over and you became that life and God is just washing at you. You are doing your best because there's something you can do. The Bible says the bride has made us off rich. So the bride has got something to say and you God is just washing at you. You are 30 40 60 70 until now now you no longer you are back and God is just getting what is coming. No sir, if there is a purpose, there must be a way provided must come to pass. Hallelujah. But God will always arrive on time. [Music] Even when you're on your deathbed, it is God's appointed time. He will visit you brother, he will come there. &gt;&gt; The situation will change. You will go, you will turn back on your foot. You will go do your best to serve God. So our God is on time God. Amen. Amen. We just need to be updated. is going on many time I've heard our pastor telling us that it's not me saying this but it is an inspiration and God has given me this and this brother that is it is the time for us to do something. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. These guys they knew that that fire would consume. But still they say even if &gt;&gt; but again they say he's more than able. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. I want to quote something for you here. In the message, God keeps his word. The prophecy, I just love that when I think of that, just at that crucial time, he is not one minute late. He's always just on time. If you can just be like that or we try to push the thing, we try to make it our time. Let us try to make it our time. Amen. But let God work it out on his own time. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. In this message, he say that and it's very seldom I ever hit anything that I that I make anything out of but I was thinking just before I reached down to get this that what that I'm try that uh I try going to try to say to you I was staying off Israel down in Egypt and they were slaves and yet they were children of God. Well, we all know the story. And if they throw if they throw them molded bread, they had to eat it. If they if they if they refresh their daughters, they they kill their sons and whatever they did, it was just done. What will you do? They were slaves and yet them were the chosen with a promise waiting until the time of fulfillment. You hear that? Whether their girls were raped, whether their daughters were killed or sedu [Music] and yet they were chosen children of God. They were elected of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; But what was waiting was until the time of the fulfillment. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When that time has not come yet, even if you dance on the needle, even if you hold and cry, nothing will happen. Why? Because God knows what he's doing. Hallelujah. He want you to go through that &gt;&gt; when you come out of that situation, &gt;&gt; you will be in position to encourage others and tell them, "Hey boys, it works. Yes, I lost my first child 10 years ago, but today I can encourage somebody and tell him my brother the Lord gives the Lord takes. Amen. I am still alive. Blessed with men and daughters. No wonder God has given him many and daughters. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; He has paid you with a bonus. You knew how painful it was. Do you know what? When that happened, people blamed me. Some if not majority blamed me. How can you take your wife to go and deliver from the village? How dare you taking her country? I sit in the village every woman who gives birth children like praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But God knew what he was doing. I knew that she was going to give a to give birth to a baby girl. I knew that very well. Heard her name. I know she was going to deliver. Normally they called me and told me they were going to uh your wife is going to uh to be to to to be operating because the baby has taken long and long [Music] but I never saw that and what I saw coming it was not part of the package. &gt;&gt; I said no. I remember that evening it was our next day. I was from church. Amen. I reached around Zana roundabout. They called and gave me that information. I said I'm not going to go back. Let me I started praying from there going back to church said let me go spend a night there praying for my wife. Praise be to God. By the time I reach church compound, if I've not forgotten, I received another call that she has delivered normally. Praise be to God. [Applause] So humanly many time we tend to rush that is in our nature. You have no coin. You believe God for for money. Every time midnight is four. You get your phone and start scrolling. [Music] This one is demanding. &gt;&gt; You would have hoped me back. Why preachers of time? I remember one preacher say that most times it's when the angels are just backing at you. They're beckoning at you that we are coming and brother is already turning his back. He's going back. God has not answered after fasting for three days. Have you ever found someone who think he has been disappointed by God crying? It is different crying. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; But that is not the case. God comes on time. It's not just God's time. Amen. Have you sought for the Holy Ghost for two years now and you're not receiving? Amen. He's just going to come on time. Maybe you'll be singing a special song. And before you realize the church, everybody's crying. You're touched by the song. And before you realize, you are singing in tong. Hallelujah. before you realize the pianist playing it song is God's time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's what we are looking at on time. God when Lazarus died oh they mock Martha. Where is that guy? The one who saved us from the other lunch when we went where we had no money. [Music] He when he made bread he multiply those fish and take long without eating it and you say it's your friend he's dying and maybe after very many words Lazarus died. Mary cried. Mary cried. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; But Jesus, he was he was seeing vision and he was seeing a drama. Praise be to God. He was 100% God, 100% man. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Maybe was communicating Lazarus's soul one or the other. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; First day they will say he had fainted. They will say second day they will say I can even spend two days in coma. But remember when you're in coma there is something moning your heart [Applause] second day. Are you in the st and before they realize flies were why don't you go bury this guy? I don't understand but he's going to resurrect. Muslims you die. Why &gt;&gt; for us Christian we say we shall raise the dead. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God on the fourth day Jesus tells the disciple now is the time. Let's go do the father's business. Yeah. offering Lazarus is isolate. Praise be to God. If he's asleep, &gt;&gt; active brother Peter. Ah, that's one waking it up. Waking him up. I think he said he's dead. That is different. Praise be to God. But God was not too late. When Jesus arrived, &gt;&gt; he came. The clock was ticking. 6 p.m. &gt;&gt; 7 8 Let me say reached at midday around 11 something reached just 59 minutes just on time. They wondering they were said out everybody where is Lazarus. &gt;&gt; Oh master it is too late. Show me where he is. That man is there. If you were here, if you believe that, do you believe the glory of God? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Told them remove the stone. Amen. Amen. Count down. &gt;&gt; In the last00 countdown, Lazarus come forth &gt;&gt; is on time. God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going to handle your situation on time. He's handling mine on time. Don't say brother, you told us that. You told us you are. We have been praying for you. You told us you pray that God provide you. Brother, sister, the car will arrive on time. Praise be to God. And you sitting here, you will dedicate it. Praise be to God. Amen. Amen. It will be on time. We are going to build our houses on time. God is in time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; We don't need to We don't need to lie. No sir. God is going to answer us on time. His own time. God. I was reading a quote here. Because of time I may not go there. Yeah. Say that God spoke, he laid the seed before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; He laid the seed there. &gt;&gt; So when the world was in that mess mixed up, that seed was there and God spoke the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the word was manifested. &gt;&gt; And as I'm finish this, I'm finishing this quote, he says, "And like in God's appointed time, time for fulfillment, but there came a day. They had got so far away from it. They don't recognize it. They don't know when the time come, but God always is on time. Yes, they never knew the time when the deliver was going to be born. Here Moses was born just on time. Praise be to God. He's on time. God gone. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now that is what is the matter with the Pentecostal today. They don't recognize the time is here. The time has come. God promised to be God's promise to be fulfilled. Amen. Brother, the time has come. Amen. Let us just keep pressing on. Jesus promised us that is coming for us is 2,000 years. But he said in my father's house, I'm in a mansion. If it wasn't so, I would have not told you. But because I'm going to the father, I'll come for you. Amen. In God's appointed time, he has sent the prophet through the ages. Send preachers. They sent evangelists, teachers, apostles. Amen. They are preaching night and day. They are laboring night and day for the perfection of the bride. And in God's appointed time, just one time is coming for us. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Our God is a seasoned God. He will always come on time. That's why I said there's time for everything. There's time for my trial. And when I'm destroyed, I will tell God. Help me endure. Help me stand firm. Help me stand still. praise God. When Job was being tried, Amen. He endured, it was his trying moment. But when the time for fulfillment had come, God himself just on time after he had complained and said I wish I knew where God's face I knew is gone. Hallelujah. Many time we complain almost God is then God just arrived on time. Job, where were you? He started asking him question. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Jesus felt like giving up the call. Amen. And he prayed, "Father, if it's possible, he was negotiating with the father, if it is possible. Take this cup away. &gt;&gt; Just on time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just on time on mountain transfiguration. He arrived on time and he was encouraged. So he's on time. God [Music] don't be controlled by time. God have prayed for marriage.

[Laughter] Praise be to God. What is God's time? Brother, sister, we know these things we're talking about. We have even seen some of these things in our life where you are in a corner. And you wonder how will you how you how you come out of that. &gt;&gt; Few years ago I got an accident. I had never knocked even a chicken. Oh the way they handled me. Oh brother, sister things became so tough. I sat there and I asked myself how am I going to get out of this? They asked for money for upkeep. You have to give the patient assistance every day. Every time they seeing you, oh that man, that they call you. Oh, your patient is bad. Lord, it was like I' got a special a patient a special care until even the family started to suffer. It was my trying moment brother sister but thank you for your prayer. I never mured brother. I never complained. I never asked God why me but I asked for grace. Amen. That Sunday morning I was coming to church. I was rushing to come and start the service. Amen. You mean God was on safari. He was present there, brother. He knew it was going to happen. Amen. Because before the foundation of the world, God knows how many steps I'm going to take on. He knows how many time I'm going to sneeze. Oh yes. How many time I'm going to to b my eyes? &gt;&gt; He knows that. And that the Lord just allows it to happen. And see, will I slap my wife? Because I remember the scenario that day.
