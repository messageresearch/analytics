[33:35] seats I want us to go back where we
[33:38] first
[33:44] read we are seeing here in Hebrews
[33:47] chapter
[33:52] 2 Apostle Paul is telling us something
[33:55] here
[33:58] and it is a warning as
[34:01] well we know the time we are living
[34:04] in there are many things happening
[34:08] around we are living in Lan Church
[34:13] age we are in the ends of the end
[34:18] time we are living in the time where the
[34:20] Bible warns us in
[34:25] Revelation where the church will be look
[34:30] home not hot not
[34:34] cold and God say that he will spute this
[34:38] church out of his
[34:43] mouth blessed be the name of the Lord we
[34:47] are living in the
[34:48] time where there are a lot of forces
[34:51] fighting against the
[34:53] [Music]
[34:54] church and where the church when we're
[34:57] talking about the
[34:58] church we are not talking about this
[35:01] building but we are talking about the
[35:03] bride of
[35:06] Christ blessed be the name of the Lord
[35:09] Jesus told us that Upon This
[35:13] Rock he will build a
[35:16] church amen
[35:18] amen and I say where that church is we
[35:22] are meaning the
[35:25] bride blessed be the name
[35:28] Lord amen and here he says that
[35:33] therefore we ought to give more
[35:40] honest more honest he to things which we
[35:44] have
[35:48] heard amen what are those things which
[35:51] we have
[35:54] heard Apostle Paul is telling us
[35:58] to give more
[36:02] Hest the things that we have
[36:08] heard amen when we come to
[36:12] church we don't just come to
[36:15] sit go back and we forget what we have
[36:20] heard blessed be the name of the
[36:24] Lord I remember one time we talked about
[36:30] uh being on

[37:00] Lord amen let us keep the
[37:06] pace let us keep moving
[37:10] forward blessed be the name of the
[37:13] Lord otherwise by the time you
[37:20] realize found yourself when you're
[37:22] already
[37:25] backl you know many time when we talk
[37:27] about
[37:29] backsliding we think it's committing
[37:32] fornication and when someone say so so
[37:36] back you think maybe
[37:41] fornicated that's not it it's part of it
[37:47] okay but
[37:50] backsliding let me tell you many
[37:54] Believers many Christians

[38:31] ceasing pray
[38:34] always blessed be the name of the
[38:37] Lord
[38:39] amen he said L at any time we should let
[38:42] them
[38:48] sleep for if the word spoken by
[38:54] Angels was steast
[38:58] and every
[39:01] transgression and every
[39:05] Disobedience received a just recompense
[39:09] of

[1:32:13] commotion why because God turn his back
[1:32:20] to Because of Your
[1:32:22] Action because of your

[1:33:03] B the was listening and was
[1:33:06] saying let's put our
[1:33:09] heart toward the ground where we came
[1:33:13] from KN that one day we shall go
[1:33:19] back praise be to
[1:33:22] God we have to be
[1:33:25] careful when the presence of God comes
[1:33:29] down we ought to be so
[1:33:33] careful and be praying God do not byass
[1:33:38] me I know your presence is here create
[1:33:42] an
[1:33:43] atmosphere attract go to pass your
[1:33:47] way that's what B
[1:33:50] did yes sir he was
[1:33:54] expecting he was waiting and when he had
[1:33:58] noise he said I have him Jesus of
[1:34:04] nazare on me of
[1:34:08] naare do you think that Jesus had his
[1:34:12] cry like physical
[1:34:17] cry the Bible says he
[1:34:20] shouted but where
[1:34:22] Jesus is
[1:34:24] this man was even
[1:34:26] blind I believe they maybe the voices
[1:34:30] overshadowed but his
[1:34:33] faith touched on Jesus because Jesus is
[1:34:37] Touched By
[1:34:40] Faith yes sir and that is what I believe
[1:34:45] that when the presence of God is down
[1:34:48] when God is moving when God is
[1:34:51] speaking maybe the holy spoken
[1:34:55] Tong he
[1:34:58] hased and somebody's there waiting say
[1:35:01] oh God I know you are still here you
[1:35:04] cannot bypass me you know my condition
[1:35:08] brother trust me God cannot
[1:35:14] by many time we
[1:35:18] rush but if he can wait a little
[1:35:22] longer say Lord Break Me Lord bend
[1:35:27] me since you have
[1:35:29] come let me tell you when God comes down
[1:35:34] that is an opportunity for a
[1:35:36] Believer it is
[1:35:38] [Applause]
[1:35:40] opportunity amen amen it is just like in
[1:35:44] the pool of
[1:35:46] Beth when the angel came and stared
[1:35:50] the dro there fast
[1:35:53] God is healing but this time round when
[1:35:57] the presence of God
[1:35:59] comes just know the angel of the Lord is
[1:36:04] here the angel of the Covenant has come
[1:36:08] he has come to confirm his word that
[1:36:11] word has been preached it is true that
[1:36:15] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:36:19] and forever so in such a
[1:36:22] moment we to be
[1:36:24] reverence you want to be praying in your
[1:36:28] heart even little
[1:36:31] children when you hear such a
[1:36:35] commotion when the Holy Spirit is
[1:36:38] moving be
[1:36:40] careful don't move around don't start
[1:36:44] laughing teing your
[1:36:46] friends in doing that the angel of the
[1:36:50] Lord will end up striking you dead
[1:36:57] blessed be the name
[1:36:59] of I read in the
[1:37:02] message was praying forward
[1:37:07] EP and a certain
[1:37:09] Minister he said let us close our
[1:37:12] eyes and be
[1:37:14] reverent and this man he thought was
[1:37:16] more spiritual
[1:37:20] than he refused
[1:37:23] they prayed for The Boy The Boy got
[1:37:26] healed the demon went and entered that
[1:37:36] minister so it's like when they're
[1:37:38] casting the demon out of
[1:37:40] some you're supposed to close your eyes
[1:37:44] and be in prayer not gazing
[1:37:50] around he will jump out of that
[1:37:54] and get
[1:37:55] inside and you live here when you are
[1:37:59] worse so we have to be
[1:38:04] careful many time we do those
[1:38:07] things
[1:38:09] because we are
[1:38:11] called we are not sensitive
[1:38:14] enough to know that the Holy Ghost has
[1:38:17] come down and Believers ought to be
[1:38:21] serious and careful
[1:38:27] blessed be the name of the Lord how did
[1:38:29] people get
[1:38:31] healed even when they are not prayed
[1:38:34] for from the
[1:38:36] congregation it is because someone in
[1:38:38] the
[1:38:39] congregation is pulling the gift of God
[1:38:43] by believing it by being so reverent and
[1:38:48] so sensitive that since the Lord has
[1:38:51] come
[1:38:52] down and speaking that person in the
[1:38:54] prayer
[1:38:55] line that same
[1:38:58] God touch
[1:39:01] me and that's why God brought us these
[1:39:06] things remember the Bible tells us this
[1:39:09] was for our
[1:39:17] examples butam say the message have not
[1:39:20] I sent thee
[1:39:25] when you feel that when you feel that
[1:39:27] little buzzer down in your heart warning
[1:39:33] [Music]
[1:39:36] you then you better stop right there and
[1:39:40] take
[1:39:43] [Music]
[1:39:47] inventory don't keep on
[1:39:50] moving praise be to God
[1:39:58] like I've been preaching along through
[1:40:00] the night of the people breathing away
[1:40:02] from
[1:40:05] God when you hear the word
[1:40:09] come come right
[1:40:12] back it is truly the word of
[1:40:15] God there is still BS
[1:40:20] ringing you better listen to
[1:40:25] it don't walk across
[1:40:28] that because you will never get any
[1:40:30] further till you come right
[1:40:34] there where you left
[1:40:36] him you
[1:40:40] see praise be to God are you seeing what
[1:40:44] the prophet
[1:40:47] say when you hear that in your
[1:40:50] heart stop there and do the inventory
[1:40:52] your life
[1:40:54] and he has told
[1:40:57] us
[1:40:59] no you will never reach
[1:41:01] there until you come back where you left
[1:41:07] him let me
[1:41:09] ask where did you leave him in your
[1:41:15] life no longer pray
[1:41:24] sometimes Believers come to
[1:41:27] church you find making another service
[1:41:38] outside as believer believe we we should
[1:41:41] be
[1:41:44] better you come early to
[1:41:47] church and you sit in the
[1:41:50] chair and you look around
[1:41:54] do inventory in your
[1:41:58] life because every time when we come
[1:42:01] here say God you know I'm
[1:42:07] dirty please do
[1:42:09] something by the time the word
[1:42:12] comes let me be
[1:42:17] candidate that is the spirit we ought to
[1:42:19] walk
[1:42:22] into shall we stand on our
[1:42:24] feet
[1:42:34] amen I'm ending with this quote where
[1:42:36] the Prophet saying lifting off the
[1:42:38] pressure
[1:42:41] that take me back to the Rock
[1:42:45] Lord take me back to the Rock
[1:42:49] Lord take me
[1:42:51] back I'm drifting
