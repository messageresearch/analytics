[1:09:17] [Music]
[1:09:46] amen
[1:10:29] that is a good lesson for the church of
[1:10:31] the living god
[1:10:35] if we don't play the game according to
[1:10:38] the rules
[1:10:42] we
[1:10:56] game
[1:10:59] we are running the race
[1:11:02] in this race we are running emirates
[1:11:05] we have got the rules governing it
[1:11:10] takes
[1:11:24] upon them that you want only those who
[1:11:26] are following
[1:11:28] the rule of the game
[1:11:31] praise be to god amen napoleon played
[1:11:34] the game in the wrong way
[1:11:47] [Applause]
[1:12:14] [Applause]
[1:12:47] but when jesus changes his
[1:13:10] we might be the greatest denomination
[1:13:13] sorry if we uh if the rule of the game
[1:13:17] in this place is a man must be born
[1:13:19] again
[1:13:24] to enter into the fellowship of christ
[1:13:27] and his church
[1:13:30] christ
[1:13:37] but if we haven't played the rule of the
[1:13:40] game we will be
[1:13:42] disqualified at the end now you want to
[1:13:44] talk goodbye
[1:13:57] we are bragging about our great church
[1:14:01] our big powerful pastor i'm assuming
[1:14:05] but have you ever thought
[1:14:07] never you know was this have you ever
[1:14:08] asked yourself
[1:14:10] are we following the rule of the game oh
[1:14:35] [Applause]
[1:14:38] i mean but god goes with minority
[1:15:11] [Applause]
[1:15:50] not what you think
[1:15:51] [Music]
[1:16:10] [Music]
[1:16:18] being a great warrior and great
[1:16:20] conqueror napoleoni
[1:16:25] he conquered the people under fear
[1:16:30] praise you to god i mean
[1:16:32] even our days now
[1:16:35] some of this man
[1:16:40] you go ask your pastor again
[1:16:44] the bible says i read some scripture
[1:16:46] here and
[1:17:00] be careful
[1:17:47] it doesn't make any difference how much
[1:17:49] we feel like that we are progressing
[1:17:56] until we get back to the rule of the
[1:17:59] game
[1:18:02] praise be to god
[1:18:04] and the strongest force that i know of
[1:18:06] is love
[1:18:11] so if we are going to play this game as
[1:18:13] we would call it
[1:18:17] we are going to win we know
[1:18:20] and we have got to go back to the
[1:18:22] winning principles
[1:18:53] [Applause]
[1:19:06] home
[1:19:08] get those kids dressings
[1:19:12] but take them out of your way

[1:21:32] [Applause]
[1:21:39] amen
[1:21:41] fear must be forced why do you know
[1:21:45] sometimes you wonder when we are at
[1:21:46] church
[1:21:51] before even we come to fellowship
[1:22:01] [Music]
[1:22:08] but when you enter in the spirit of god

[1:22:36] he will receive some funny funny strain
[1:22:39] until you wonder how who shaved him yes

[1:25:05] but let us enter in the spirit
[1:25:08] amen
[1:25:24] before even the world

[1:25:53] winning principle
[1:26:01] to god
[1:26:02] amen
[1:26:04] and you see all these great sins and
[1:26:06] wonders that
[1:26:19] godly christian love and respect for god
[1:26:22] and his people
[1:26:31] it will fail
[1:26:34] amen
[1:26:35] it's just
[1:26:36] it's just got to fail big jacob
[1:26:39] because it has no foundation

[1:27:00] others feel their foundation on the
[1:27:01] things of the world
[1:27:17] [Applause]
[1:27:27] and that is what each individuals of the
[1:27:29] church owe to bypass in their hearts
[1:27:36] to do their very best for the kingdom of
[1:27:39] god
[1:27:43] and how do you serve god
[1:27:47] here when you are serving one another
[1:27:53] when you are
[1:27:54] when you are taking
[1:27:56] the little one
[1:27:57] when you are taking the little end of
[1:27:58] their own
[1:28:03] as it was to say
[1:28:07] amen amen and men who was ever mounted
[1:28:10] to down and became not great men sorry

[1:28:40] praise be to god amen
[1:28:43] amen i mean
[1:28:44] you hear what you are saying that that
[1:28:46] is what is
[1:28:48] that
[1:28:48] what is in the figure
[1:28:50] of the church oh to bypass in the heart
[1:28:54] a
[1:29:05] we have to take each one of us
[1:29:08] to purpose in our heart why would that
[1:29:10] fail not to renew my religion with image
