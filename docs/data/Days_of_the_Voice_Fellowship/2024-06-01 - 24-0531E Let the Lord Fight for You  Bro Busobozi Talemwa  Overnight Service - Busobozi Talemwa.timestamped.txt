[52:41] problem you did not come to
[52:44] church you are not a genuine
[52:47] Christian because you don't have
[52:49] money you do not come to church you are
[52:53] not a genuine Christian I did not say
[52:55] you are not a Christian
[52:58] but I said you're not a genuine
[53:00] Christian because you know they do not
[53:03] pay you on
[53:04] time or because you felt you know a
[53:07] little bad about
[53:09] something and then you said I will not
[53:11] even go to
[53:12] church I will not even you know you know
[53:15] go there let let them come and call
[53:19] me and some people have realized one one
[53:22] person can decide to stay at home
[53:27] waiting to see someone calling
[53:31] him and if no one calls him he will say
[53:34] they don't even
[53:35] care I will not even go to church they
[53:39] don't even love me I will not even go to
[53:42] church you are not a genuine
[53:44] Christian the prophet says a genuine
[53:47] Christian you don't have to Baby
[53:50] him you don't have to part
[53:53] him you don't have to tell him this to
[53:56] tell him that or tell him the other he
[53:59] has got something in
[54:01] him a genuine Christian has got a
[54:04] baptism of the Holy
[54:07] Spirit it says that throws all the rest
[54:09] of
[54:11] it what does it throw off it throws
[54:15] everything the devil brings to
[54:17] him a genuine
[54:20] Christian is not is not is not someone
[54:23] that does not uh does not do
[54:29] wrong oh he's not talking about someone
[54:31] who is
[54:33] perfect no Christian is
[54:35] perfect in the sense of human
[54:39] Perfection but every every genuine
[54:42] Christian is
[54:44] perfect in the sense of God is
[54:48] perfection but there's something the
[54:50] prophet was trying to get to
[54:52] here he's saying he it will throw
[54:55] everything that baptism of the Holy
[54:56] Ghost in
[54:58] him will throw all the rest of it
[55:02] off you don't have to beg him
[55:05] around because he's a genuine plant of
[55:11] God you know a genuine Christian is like
[55:14] a like a a real
[55:19] plant that is not what is the other what
[55:22] are the others called yes but they have
[55:24] a name these days you know they they
[55:26] just make them in the
[55:30] lab and if you plant it it cannot
[55:32] reproduce
[55:34] itself
[55:37] yes it is hybrid yes hybrid it is hybrid
[55:42] is not
[55:44] original here in Uganda we used to have
[55:46] a lot of uh original
[55:50] Plants but you know some people came up
[55:53] with
[55:55] ideas from the West
[55:58] maybe and they brought it here I told
[56:02] people you see now when you plant this
[56:04] one you will have a higher
[56:08] yield if you plant this one you will
[56:11] become richer
[56:13] faster you see it's all about getting
[56:16] big
[56:17] things it's all about being richer
[56:21] faster it's all about getting
[56:24] plenty but when whatever you get out of
[56:28] it you can it cannot reproduce
[56:32] itself you have to go back and buy the
[56:34] seeds from
[56:36] them because those seeds are
[56:39] hybrid but what we had here in Africa
[56:41] what we still have but it's not it's not
[56:43] no longer as much as we used to
[56:46] have is we used to have original
[56:49] seeds whereby you know if you plant
[56:54] beans you don't need to go and buy seeds
[56:58] again you plant
[57:00] seeds
[57:02] beans and when you have
[57:04] vest you take out what we call
[57:09] seed you you you you you you keep a few
[57:14] kilograms which will be seed for another
[57:18] season and again if it is maze same
[57:22] thing if it is another plant same thing
[57:26] now because of the hybrid
[57:29] plants they are very
[57:31] weak they need to be parted on the
[57:35] back they look so
[57:38] beautiful and it looks like Brother
[57:40] Joseph they yield a
[57:44] lot but when you plant
[57:46] them you you you have to P them on the
[57:50] back you
[57:53] have you have to bring you know I don't
[57:56] even know what they they put on
[58:01] them you know it's called man you know
[58:04] you have to bring a lot of that you have
[58:06] to spr them you have to spray
[58:08] them you have to you know try your
[58:12] best to ensure that you know it doesn't
[58:15] die
[58:17] off is that right because it is
[58:21] hybrid but original you don't need to do
[58:25] anything on the
[58:28] original original is
[58:31] strong original is
[58:34] genuine original has that genuine you
[58:38] know genuiness in inside
[58:42] it original has
[58:46] Life original will reproduce
[58:50] itself original has a power within it
[58:53] that self activates
[58:58] in the same way the prophet is talking
[59:01] about a genuine
[59:06] Christian you cannot stay at
[59:08] home and way to be bed
[59:12] around when there is a prayer
[59:15] meeting because you feel
[59:18] ly because you feel weak because you
[59:21] don't have money in your
[59:23] pocket because of this and that
[59:26] you feel so
[59:28] discouraged and you decide not to serve
[59:31] God and you are waiting for someone to
[59:33] beg
[59:34] you please brother
[59:37] come you know God has something prepared
[59:40] for you
[59:41] please come we pray
[59:44] together just try your best you'll never
[59:46] know what God will
[59:48] please how many one that kind of
[59:51] encouragement if you are one of them
[59:53] you're not a genuine Christian
[59:56] the prophet is saying a genuine
[59:58] Christian has the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:01] Ghost he has got something in
[1:00:04] him amen that throws all the rest of it
[1:00:09] out no matter how you
[1:00:12] feel let me go before the Lord no matter
[1:00:16] what is going on around you let me go
[1:00:19] before the
[1:00:20] Lord I know God has a solution for
[1:00:23] me you don't feel like it
[1:00:27] but there's something on the inside
[1:00:30] of that calls for what you are receiving
[1:00:32] right
[1:00:33] now because you're a genuine
[1:00:37] Christian and he says he has got
[1:00:39] something in him that
[1:00:41] was amen hallelujah am it's not a lazy
[1:00:47] something the Holy Ghost is not a lazy
[1:00:50] something the Holy Ghost

[1:24:09] chapter
[1:24:12] 5 verse
[1:24:14] 17 and when the Philistines heard that
[1:24:17] they had anointed David King over
[1:24:22] Israel all the Philistines came up to
[1:24:24] seek
[1:24:26] David and David heard of it and went
[1:24:30] down to the
[1:24:31] hold and the Philistines also came and
[1:24:34] spread themselves in the valley of
[1:24:40] refin and
[1:24:42] David inquired of the
[1:24:46] Lord this is the thing we do not do many
[1:24:51] times David the moment he was anointed
[1:24:53] as king
[1:24:56] his enemies brought War to
[1:25:00] him his enemies came to make war with
[1:25:04] him did you know the moment you cross
[1:25:08] over is the time the battle
[1:25:12] begins did you know the moment you in
[1:25:14] the place where God wants you to
[1:25:18] be is when the war
[1:25:21] begins how many knew that
[1:25:24] you see here when the moment they
[1:25:26] crossed over the Red
[1:25:28] Sea and went over to the other
[1:25:32] side they thought they had suffered in
[1:25:34] the desert all these
[1:25:37] years this was going to be the beginning
[1:25:39] of
[1:25:42] War but God fought that
[1:25:45] war god fought that b
[1:25:47] for and we see here when the moment that
[1:25:50] David was anointed king over is
[1:25:56] that very
[1:25:57] moment the people heard of
[1:25:59] it and and and and and the Philistines
[1:26:02] came to seek
[1:26:05] David and and David heard of it and he
[1:26:08] he he went down to the
[1:26:13] hold and the Philistines also came and
[1:26:15] spread themselves in the valley
[1:26:19] of your enemy is not going to get scared
[1:26:22] of you and run

[1:42:07] Holy
[1:42:09] Spirit is the
[1:42:11] moment the devil will send his army
[1:42:14] around
[1:42:15] you he will not leave you
[1:42:18] alone he will send his armies around
[1:42:21] you but I have a medicine for
[1:42:24] you I have a secret to share with you
[1:42:28] today when David amen was surrounded by
[1:42:31] the
[1:42:33] Philistines and they were in the valley
[1:42:35] of
[1:42:37] RAF David inquired of the
[1:42:42] Lord you see that's why we should be
[1:42:44] here to inquire of the
[1:42:48] Lord he came to him and says shall I go
[1:42:51] up to the Philistines
[1:42:55] will you deliver them into my
[1:42:58] hand and the Lord said unto
[1:43:02] David go
[1:43:04] up for I will doubtless deliver
[1:43:08] thee deliver the Philistines into th
[1:43:14] hand that's what God is telling us to
[1:43:18] know when we when you come in pray Oh
[1:43:20] Glory to God when when we come to God In
[1:43:24] Prayer let it not be a dry
[1:43:28] prayer let it be a a
[1:43:32] conversation I don't know how many here
[1:43:34] have ever
[1:43:35] prayed up to a moment when you hear God
[1:43:38] speaking back to
[1:43:40] you you ask him things and he begin also
[1:43:43] answering
[1:43:44] back I've experienced that before and I
[1:43:46] tell you it is the
[1:43:49] sweetest environment you want to be in
[1:43:54] when you begin to go in prayer you begin
[1:43:56] to speak to the Lord you know you it is
[1:43:59] it is
[1:44:00] enjoyable you begin to talk to him and
[1:44:03] you begin to talk to him and you begin
[1:44:06] to tell him how you feel what you've
[1:44:08] been through your enemies around you
[1:44:11] Lord see this Spirit here see this thing
[1:44:14] here see this thing here I don't know
[1:44:16] what to do Lord what should I do should
[1:44:19] I fight it how should I fight it and he
[1:44:22] will speak back to you and he will tell
[1:44:24] you go up I will deliver that
[1:44:29] enemy into your
[1:44:34] hands amen hallelujah amen my my my my
[1:44:41] oh
[1:44:41] [Music]
[1:44:42] Hallelujah and and and and
[1:44:45] David came to a place called
[1:44:49] bism and David smart them there
[1:44:54] and and say the Lord has broken forth
[1:44:56] upon my enemies before
[1:45:00] me as the breach of
[1:45:13] waters praise the name of the Lord
[1:45:17] amen therefore he called the name of the
[1:45:20] place bism
[1:45:23] and there they left their
[1:45:27] images and David and his men burned
[1:45:33] them isn't not not very
[1:45:38] interesting when when the Devil comes to
[1:45:40] fight
[1:45:41] you and he runs so fast away from
[1:45:47] you that he leaves his images
[1:45:50] behind that he leaves his
[1:45:54] behind and when the brothers will see
[1:45:57] them they would just collect and burn
[1:46:01] them let me now prophesy to
[1:46:05] us whatever your enemy has
[1:46:09] been what is your enemy speak your enemy

[1:46:49] going to fight your enemy
[1:46:51] tonight in prayer
[1:46:54] and the Believers will capture all the
[1:46:57] remaining
[1:47:00] idols and burn
[1:47:02] them that's the fire of
[1:47:06] Believers that is in
[1:47:08] prayer they went to
[1:47:10] war we go to war in prayer David went to
[1:47:14] war with his
[1:47:16] man we go to war in
[1:47:19] prayer Hallelujah and the Philistines
[1:47:22] came up yet
[1:47:24] again and spread themselves in the
[1:47:26] Valley of
[1:47:30] the and when David inquired of the
[1:47:34] Lord he
[1:47:36] said Thou shalt not go
[1:47:41] up but f a compass be behind
[1:47:47] them and come upon them
[1:47:55] against the mberry
[1:47:59] trees and let it be when thou hearest
[1:48:03] the sound of a going in the tops of the
[1:48:05] malberry
[1:48:06] trees
[1:48:14] when thou shal
[1:48:17] thyself for then shall the Lord go out
[1:48:20] before theee to Smite the horse of the f
[1:48:28] and David did so as the Lord had
[1:48:32] commanded and SM the Philistines from G
[1:48:36] until Thou come to
[1:48:39] gazar I want you to imagine this
[1:48:43] friends that was the first time then the
[1:48:45] second
[1:48:47] time the Philistines came back
[1:48:51] again and sleeping all
[1:48:55] around and David inquired of the
[1:48:58] Lord the problem we have as
[1:49:01] beli we never
[1:49:05] pray we go to fight our enemies using
[1:49:08] our kind
[1:49:11] senses when you have
[1:49:14] problems you got to cry to your
[1:49:17] neighbors to your friends to your
[1:49:21] relatives when you have issu
[1:49:24] isues inquire of the
[1:49:27] Lord but we should always inquire of the
[1:49:31] Lord and the inquiring of the Lord is
[1:49:33] really
[1:49:35] prayer when you you feel that your back
[1:49:38] is against the
[1:49:42] war that's the time for us to go and
[1:49:45] pray and every the second time he again
[1:49:47] went before
[1:49:49] prayer and he said the first time the
[1:49:51] Lord said go
[1:49:54] preached a message
[1:49:57] presuming many Believers
[1:50:01] presume that God is with me even the
[1:50:04] first time I went to him when I was in
[1:50:05] such a problem it was still the
[1:50:07] Philistines that had come to me and he
[1:50:09] told me go so even this time I'm sure
[1:50:10] God wants me
[1:50:17] to not every
[1:50:19] time God will tell you to do the same
[1:50:22] thing he told
[1:50:24] the
[1:50:25] past God knows what your enem is
[1:50:29] plotting the strength of your enemy the
[1:50:32] wisdom of your enemy and God Alone can
[1:50:35] help you out of your
[1:50:37] trouble and how is he going to help you
[1:50:42] prayer
[1:50:45] prayer the first time God told
[1:50:50] him the second time God told him M wait
[1:50:55] don't
[1:50:56] go hold back put your men
[1:51:00] around and here is what you should
[1:51:03] do you will you will
[1:51:06] wait and when you
[1:51:08] hear the
[1:51:12] sound going around on the top of the
[1:51:14] malberry
[1:51:18] trees then you will know the Lord has
[1:51:21] gone before you
[1:51:25] to Smite your
[1:51:28] enemy that's why I was telling you that
[1:51:30] let the Lord fight for
[1:51:35] you this is how God fought for
[1:51:39] David and David was just going to
[1:51:43] fight but God had gone brother Dixon
[1:51:47] come and here was God
[1:51:54] and he went before
[1:51:56] him come here
[1:52:00] brother and go behind this
[1:52:03] brother walk behind him walk behind him
[1:52:08] that's how God wants it to
[1:52:09] be that's how God wants it to
[1:52:12] be God was ahead of
[1:52:16] him God simply told him
[1:52:19] wait because he God is not a man God is
[1:52:24] a
[1:52:26] spirit so how could David see
[1:52:31] God he could not see
[1:52:34] him but God made he told him he made a
[1:52:39] provision and he said there
[1:52:42] is trees here
[1:52:46] before and um you will hear a wind
[1:52:53] [Music]
[1:52:55] when you hear
[1:52:57] that now you can begin to
[1:53:01] move but the whole
[1:53:06] time God was
[1:53:09] standing come come come God was
[1:53:12] standing and David was
[1:53:14] standing but David did not know God was
[1:53:17] before
[1:53:18] him what do we do many times
[1:53:22] you as a human being you are seeing your
[1:53:26] enemies you are seeing your
[1:53:28] enemies coming against you and even if
[1:53:33] God told me to

[1:53:38] go and you pass
[1:53:42] God and you whatever you will find
[1:53:46] there all the suffering you will find
[1:53:50] there God will not be with you
[1:53:53] you will suffer

[1:54:03] you brother you need
[1:54:05] God you don't need education you need
[1:54:09] God you don't need money you need
[1:54:12] God no matter what comes and
[1:54:16] goes stay with
[1:54:19] God if he tells you wait
[1:54:23] wait he said wait until you hear the
[1:54:26] sound of the malberry
[1:54:30] trees that is how he fights for
[1:54:34] you that's how he wants to fight for
[1:54:37] us and that's why we are here
[1:54:40] tonight to let God fight for
[1:54:43] us because we are inquiring from
[1:54:46] him when you inquire from God she will
[1:54:49] tell you what to do
[1:54:52] and and David was told to
[1:54:55] wait and then later on when he had the
[1:55:00] sound what was it what was the
[1:55:04] sound it was now God who had gone before
[1:55:08] him and then now he says now you can
[1:55:12] move now when you hear the sound God
[1:55:14] bless your
[1:55:16] brothers when you hear the
[1:55:18] sound and you you see it is impossible
[1:55:21] to defeat your enemy
[1:55:25] enemies Let Me
[1:55:26] Wait your enemies will still destroy
[1:55:33] you let us follow him he wants to fight
[1:55:37] for
[1:55:38] us God bless you let us

[1:56:00] God to fight for
[1:56:04] him you will read about
[1:56:08] him when he was sick he inquired of
[1:56:12] other
[1:56:14] gods instead of inquiring from
[1:56:17] God God wants you to inquire from
[1:56:20] me not to inquire from
[1:56:24] other and that's why we are here tonight
