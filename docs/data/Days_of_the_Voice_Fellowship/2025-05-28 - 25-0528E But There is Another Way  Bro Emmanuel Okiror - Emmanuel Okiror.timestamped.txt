[49:45] As long
[49:47] as I
[49:52] am, I
[49:57] will worship.
[50:02] I will all be silent.
[50:08] Don't be
[50:12] silent. I
[50:18] will shield
[50:21] you. For as long as I'm breathing.

[50:56] [Music]
[50:58] No,

[51:03] never.
[51:05] No,
[51:06] [Music]
[51:10] never. He
[51:13] promised
[51:15] never to
[51:17] leave

[51:19] me,
[51:21] never to leave me alone.
[51:26] Oh no

[54:32] alone.
[54:36] Halleluah. Never.
[54:40] [Music]
[54:49] Halleluah. He
[54:51] promised never to
[54:54] [Music]
[54:57] leave never to leave me alone.
[55:02] [Music]
[55:04] Let's pray.
[55:06] Dear Lord Jesus,
[55:08] one bless your name, oh
[55:10] Lord, for such a grace that you have for
[55:12] each and every one of us.
[55:15] Never to leave us alone.
[55:18] In our times of trouble, you're with
[55:20] us. In our times of difficult moments,
[55:23] you're with us, oh
[55:24] Lord. For you have never left us
[55:27] alone. Even when it seems all is
[55:31] finished, Lord, you're always in our
[55:34] midst. Thank you, Lord Jesus
[55:36] Almighty. We trust that Lord, you're
[55:39] here with
[55:40] us. And we believe that Lord Jesus
[55:43] Christ, you're going to speak unto us,
[55:45] oh Lord.
[55:47] Let thy holy spirit come
[55:49] down. Let it pass into each each one's
[55:52] heart. Let us find that portion that you
[55:55] prepared for us today for the glory of
[55:58] thy holy name. Father I thank you for
[56:00] everything. Oh Lord
[56:01] Jesus by your grace that father we are
[56:04] standing here
[56:05] again to come before thy presence oh
[56:07] Lord Jesus to present the bread of
[56:11] life to your own children.
[56:13] Father, let you completely come and take
[56:16] over. Let you bless the hearers, oh
[56:19] Lord, that I may even put this word into
[56:23] action. Thank you, Lord. In the name of
[56:26] the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[56:29] Oh, praise the
[56:31] Lord. Praise the
[56:35] Lord. Praise the
[56:37] Lord. Do you love the Lord?
[56:41] I greet you all in the name of the Lord
[56:42] Jesus
[56:44] Christ. Maybe before we sit, we can read
[56:46] from the book of Proverbs chapter 14.
[56:52] Proverbs 14:12
[56:57] only. Then we shall read even prover
[57:00] then we shall read even John chapter 10
[57:01] verse
[57:04] 10. Praise the Lord.
[57:13] Proverbs chapter 14 verse 12.
[57:19] Proverbs 14. Chapter 14 verse 12.
[57:25] The Bible
[57:27] says, "There is a way which seemth right
[57:31] unto a man, but the end thereof are the
[57:34] ways of death.
[57:46] Then chapter 10 verse 10 of John.
[57:50] The Bible says that the thief cometh not
[57:53] but for to steal and to kill and to
[57:56] destroy. I am come that they might have
[57:59] life and they might have it in more
[58:02] abundantly.
[58:06] [Music]
[58:17] Amen. May the Lord add a blessing to the
[58:18] reading of the
[58:22] word. Praise the Lord. Praise the
[58:26] Lord. I greet you again once for in the
[58:28] name of our Lord Jesus
[58:31] Christ. and please receive greetings
[58:34] from
[58:36] pastor. He sends your his greetings to
[58:38] all the saints of the
[58:41] church and I believe that we always pray
[58:45] upon the prayer
[58:47] request that he has always sent to
[58:50] different
[58:53] platforms and I'm very sure the Lord
[58:55] shall answer
[58:57] them. Praise the Lord. praying for me
[59:01] also for it's just my first time to
[59:03] stand
[59:04] here. But I'm sure the Lord will speak
[59:06] to us.
[59:09] Do you believe? Do you believe that?
[59:11] Praise the Lord.
[59:14] Praise the
[59:15] Lord. Even greetings from my dear
[59:19] wife. She's not here with
[59:21] us, but possibly she's following
[59:25] us. Praise the Lord.
[59:28] There was one
[59:29] time at our
[59:31] workplace I had an encounter with about
[59:34] three
[59:35] people and the three people we had
[59:38] called them to do some work with
[59:41] us. But when they arrived the work was
[59:44] not ready for them to do
[59:47] yet. I had a little time to discuss with
[59:49] them
[59:51] something which the Lord had put in my
[59:54] heart. So I started speaking to them.
[59:57] All of them had a
[59:59] feedback. One said, "I'm a born
[1:00:02] again." The other said, "I am a
[1:00:05] Christian." The other one kept quiet.
[1:00:09] But these two was a born again and a
[1:00:12] Christian said that for that one, he
[1:00:15] doesn't believe in God. That is who is
[1:00:19] praise the Lord. So
[1:00:21] afterwards, we started speaking to with
[1:00:23] one another.
[1:00:25] We had a conversation for about a long
[1:00:27] time.
[1:00:30] Praise the Lord. So as we spoke, I
[1:00:33] engaged the one who was who call himself
[1:00:35] a born again
[1:00:36] person. I said since you gave your life
[1:00:38] to Christ, you have been moving with two
[1:00:41] friends of
[1:00:42] yours. What do you tell about them? What
[1:00:45] have you told them about
[1:00:46] Christ? The man said, I'm a born again
[1:00:50] person. I'm not a preacher. Praise the
[1:00:52] Lord. Then when he said, I'm not a
[1:00:54] preacher,
[1:00:55] For me, I just do dancing
[1:00:58] church. That is what I do. Then I went
[1:01:01] to the one who's a
[1:01:03] Muslim. Since you're Muslim, what good
[1:01:06] things have you shared with your other
[1:01:09] friends? He said, "I'm a Muslim. I don't
[1:01:11] know those things that
[1:01:13] you praise the Lord." Now, when I went
[1:01:16] to the sad
[1:01:17] person, the one who doesn't believe in
[1:01:20] God, for him, he kept quiet completely.
[1:01:24] But the two people who spoke said a lot
[1:01:27] of things about
[1:01:29] him, they started praising him. They
[1:01:32] said this man doesn't believe in
[1:01:34] God. He has his God that he he
[1:01:37] worships. And they said how does he
[1:01:39] worship his
[1:01:40] God, they said this man when they go to
[1:01:43] their
[1:01:44] group, they
[1:01:46] take they shake their heads. That is how
[1:01:49] they worship their God. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:52] And a lot of things that they spoke
[1:01:53] about this
[1:01:55] man praised him in many ways. Praise the
[1:01:59] Lord. But I want to tell you out of our
[1:02:02] conversation something came into my
[1:02:05] mind. I told him among all the three of
[1:02:08] you. All of you doesn't have any strong
[1:02:11] stand of your your
[1:02:12] [Music]
[1:02:13] faith. So there's another way I want to
[1:02:16] share with
[1:02:17] you and that is the way of
[1:02:19] salvation. Praise the Lord. So we
[1:02:22] started speaking with one another. At
[1:02:24] the end of it, all of them were quiet.
[1:02:27] He had no words. The one who claimed to
[1:02:30] be a born again
[1:02:31] person was also quiet. He seemed like he
[1:02:34] had never given his life to Christ. The
[1:02:37] one who claimed to be a Muslim was
[1:02:39] equally quiet. Praise the Lord. That's
[1:02:42] why today something inspired me out of
[1:02:45] that
[1:02:47] speech. I got some inspiration out of
[1:02:49] that conversation.
[1:02:52] There must be another
[1:02:54] way. That is what we are going to share.
[1:02:58] But there is another
[1:03:00] way. If all of them never had a right
[1:03:03] way, there must be another
[1:03:06] way. Praise the Lord. That's why we have
[1:03:09] read from the book of Proverbs
[1:03:14] 14:12. 14:12 that there is a way which
[1:03:18] seemth right unto man.
[1:03:22] That way it seems right unto
[1:03:25] man. Praise the Lord. But the end of it
[1:03:29] is a waste of death. Then chapter 10
[1:03:33] verse 10 of
[1:03:34] John. Praise the Lord. The Bible says
[1:03:37] that oh the Lord Jesus Christ said, I
[1:03:41] come that they might have
[1:03:43] life and they might have it in more
[1:03:46] abundance. Praise the Lord. Maybe this
[1:03:49] brother can display something
[1:03:52] here. Praise the Lord. If he has it with
[1:03:56] him, it is something just to display
[1:03:59] something about death and
[1:04:02] life and we shall see as time
[1:04:04] goes. Praise the Lord. Now the way that
[1:04:08] seem as right unto
[1:04:11] man, there are many ways in
[1:04:14] life. One of it could be a physical
[1:04:17] death.
[1:04:20] that there's a way that sin is right
[1:04:22] unto
[1:04:24] man. One of it is that which lead us
[1:04:26] unto
[1:04:28] death. But the Lord Jesus
[1:04:30] Christ gave us another way and that way
[1:04:34] is a way of
[1:04:35] life. Praise the Lord. But we are going
[1:04:38] to talk a little more about the way that
[1:04:40] lead us into
[1:04:43] death. We are not going to talk about
[1:04:45] death itself.
[1:04:47] But we are going to talk about the
[1:04:49] world. Praise the Lord. Now the death we
[1:04:52] are talking
[1:04:53] about can be physical death. It can be
[1:04:56] emotional death. Can be financial death.
[1:05:00] Praise the Lord. Sometimes you mismanage
[1:05:02] your
[1:05:04] finances. Maybe you're doing
[1:05:06] business or at home or whichever place
[1:05:10] and at the end of it all together your
[1:05:13] business dies. That will be financial
[1:05:15] death.
[1:05:17] There's also a relationship
[1:05:19] there. When you neglect the way of true
[1:05:22] marriage, praise the Lord. And you maybe
[1:05:25] take your own way, that which lives into
[1:05:29] death, even your relationship would die.
[1:05:32] Praise the Lord. There's also spiritual
[1:05:35] death. When you neglect your spiritual
[1:05:38] work with the
[1:05:39] Lord, automatically you can die. Praise
[1:05:42] the Lord. And when you die, you go to
[1:05:45] hell. Praise the Lord. Even your
[1:05:48] ministry can
[1:05:49] die. If you become so
[1:05:51] proud, but I'm the only one who can do
[1:05:54] it. Praise the Lord. For in the Bible,
[1:05:58] in the book of Isaiah, we are going to
[1:06:00] read something. I mean, from the book of
[1:06:03] Numbers, I'm going to share about
[1:06:05] somebody there. I mean the number of
[1:06:08] people who claimed that they knew
[1:06:10] more at the end of it all together they
[1:06:13] died
[1:06:14] all. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:18] Our ways are always different from God's
[1:06:21] way. How we do things is different from
[1:06:24] the way God has
[1:06:26] been. Praise the Lord for the book of
[1:06:29] Isaiah 55 verse 89.
[1:06:33] Isaiah 55 verse 8 and
[1:06:38] 9. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:43] Isaiah chapter
[1:06:46] 55 vers 8 and 9.
[1:06:50] Praise the Lord. Let us read it in the
[1:06:53] name of the Lord.
[1:06:55] says that
[1:06:57] for my souls are not your souls neither
[1:07:01] are your ways my ways says the Lord.
[1:07:05] Then verse 9 says that for as the
[1:07:07] heavens are higher than the earth so are
[1:07:09] my ways higher than your ways and my
[1:07:12] souls than your souls. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:16] [Music]
[1:07:27] [Music]
[1:07:31] Praise the Lord. Man's ways are always
[1:07:34] concentrated within
[1:07:37] sin. The nature of man's
[1:07:40] ways is always concentrated within
[1:07:44] sin. If you decide to take your own
[1:07:47] way, not in the will of God,
[1:07:50] The end of it all together is
[1:07:53] death. Praise the Lord. And the man
[1:07:56] decides his own
[1:07:57] way. In many ways it leads to
[1:08:02] death. Those ways that we have counted
[1:08:05] the the death ways that we have
[1:08:07] counted. Praise the Lord. And without
[1:08:11] God, our ways are always
[1:08:14] invalid. They cannot work out
[1:08:17] completely. And our ways don't prosper
[1:08:20] at
[1:08:21] all. Our ways cannot stand test of
[1:08:24] time. How many times you can try to
[1:08:28] pretend in one way or the other. But I
[1:08:31] want you to give it
[1:08:32] time when a trial time
[1:08:35] comes. It's always hard for our ways to
[1:08:37] stand up. Praise the Lord. And that's
[1:08:41] when you know the true colors of a
[1:08:44] person. He has been a thief in a
[1:08:47] company. It will be
[1:08:50] identical. They will identify
[1:08:52] it because his
[1:08:55] ways or her ways cannot stand the test
[1:08:58] of
[1:08:59] time. Praise the Lord. For they have a
[1:09:02] limited
[1:09:04] time when they will
[1:09:06] expire. Praise the Lord. And we keep
[1:09:09] sometimes promising
[1:09:11] ourselves that we can do it on our own.
[1:09:14] But I want you brother, sister, you
[1:09:17] can't do it on your
[1:09:18] own. Never. No one has ever done on his
[1:09:21] own. Or if Moses was to rise up and I
[1:09:25] want to go and bring the children of
[1:09:27] Israel
[1:09:28] out, he would do not make it because in
[1:09:31] the beginning he
[1:09:33] fa to go to train him in order for him
[1:09:37] to succeed. Praise the Lord. Praise the
[1:09:39] Lord. You cannot do it on your
[1:09:42] own. It takes the Lord with you.
[1:09:45] Brother sister, all man's ways which are
[1:09:50] created lead to
[1:09:52] sin. Praise the Lord. Because in most
[1:09:55] cases, God is not
[1:09:57] inclusive. In most cases, God is taken
[1:10:01] out. But when you try to do it on your
[1:10:04] own, you'll go to
[1:10:07] death. Praise the Lord. So this men were
[1:10:10] going to talk in the
[1:10:12] Bible their ways and how it led them to
[1:10:18] death. All these people seemed all these
[1:10:21] people
[1:10:22] seemed all had a relationship with God's
[1:10:26] children. All had a relationship with
[1:10:28] God's
[1:10:31] children but decided to go their own
[1:10:35] way and they ended up into death. Just
[1:10:38] like we can look at King Ahab's
[1:10:42] wife. She had a some relationship with
[1:10:44] the children of
[1:10:46] God because she was married to the king.
[1:10:49] But the ones that she
[1:10:50] chose at the end of it all the
[1:10:53] le. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:10:57] Then after
[1:10:58] briefly in conclusion we are going to
[1:11:01] look into the ways that lead to
[1:11:04] life
[1:11:06] eternal. and that life
[1:11:09] eternal. Praise the Lord. I hope you are
[1:11:13] together. Are we together? Praise the
[1:11:16] Lord. So
[1:11:18] Moses who had a great relationship with
[1:11:21] God also had a great
[1:11:25] leadership which faced many
[1:11:28] obstacles and it was
[1:11:31] tested the greatest trial in his
[1:11:34] leadership.
[1:11:36] Praise the Lord. But we are going to
[1:11:38] talk about the rebellion of
[1:11:41] Kora. Not about even
[1:11:44] others. The Bible begins in the book of
[1:11:46] Numbers chapter 16 verse
[1:11:49] one. We can read a
[1:11:52] little number
[1:11:56] 16 verse
[1:11:58] one. Maybe the brother will translate
[1:12:00] this one straight. Amen. So that we can
[1:12:03] save time. Chapter 16
[1:12:06] verse1 the Bible
[1:12:10] says the son of
[1:12:13] isar the son
[1:12:15] of the son of David
[1:12:21] and the sons
[1:12:23] of and the son
[1:12:27] of son
[1:12:29] of took
[1:12:31] men says that
[1:12:34] And they rose up before
[1:12:36] Moses with a certain of children of
[1:12:40] Israel, 250 princes of the
[1:12:46] assembly, famous men in the
[1:12:49] congregation, men of
[1:12:51] renown, and they gathered themselves
[1:12:53] together against Moses, against Aaron,
[1:12:58] and said unto them, "Yeah, take too much
[1:13:01] upon yourself, upon you, yet take too
[1:13:04] much upon
[1:13:08] you. Seeing all the congregation are
[1:13:12] holy, every one of
[1:13:15] them, the Lord is among
[1:13:17] them. The Lord is among them. Praise the
[1:13:21] Lord. Are you getting me? Praise the
[1:13:25] Lord. Maybe let me repeat verse three.
[1:13:29] And they gather themselves against Moses
[1:13:32] against and said unto them, "Yeah, take
[1:13:36] too much upon
[1:13:40] you, seeing all the congregation are
[1:13:44] holy, every one of them, and the Lord is
[1:13:47] among
[1:13:48] them. Wherefore he lift up yourselves
[1:13:51] above the congregation of the
[1:13:55] Lord." Praise the Lord. And when Moses
[1:13:58] had it, he fell upon his
[1:14:01] face. He had take too much upon
[1:14:05] yourself. This is what the famous man
[1:14:07] famous men
[1:14:09] said. The men among them was
[1:14:12] Kora and they gather themselves against
[1:14:16] Moses that you take too much upon
[1:14:19] yourself. All the congregation is
[1:14:22] holy. Why do you say then that we are
[1:14:24] the only one to talk to God?
[1:14:27] Praise the Lord. These men started
[1:14:30] speaking but like they loved
[1:14:33] God. But indeed they wanted to worship
[1:14:35] God but they had a bad
[1:14:38] intention. Praise the Lord. And when you
[1:14:41] follow
[1:14:43] closely this ways they are ways led into
[1:14:47] death. Praise the Lord. For they
[1:14:50] said for they said they began like they
[1:14:53] supported justice Roman's attention.
[1:14:58] Mark this
[1:14:59] man and Mark this man did not say the
[1:15:02] congregation was of
[1:15:05] Satan but they said it was of the
[1:15:08] Lord. Praise the Lord. This man wanted
[1:15:11] the attention of other
[1:15:14] people like these people are speaking
[1:15:17] good. You see speaking the name of the
[1:15:20] Lord. You see they are just the same as
[1:15:22] like us.
[1:15:24] Why don't we join up together with them?
[1:15:26] This Moses all the time. He said that
[1:15:30] he's the only
[1:15:31] one that talk to God. That is a bit
[1:15:35] impossible. Let us guide ourselves and
[1:15:38] indeed they rose up against
[1:15:41] Moses. But always God's
[1:15:43] servants. They always simple and easy.
[1:15:47] They don't rush to do things. They take
[1:15:50] in accordance to the leadership of God.
[1:15:53] thing Moses did. The first thing Moses
[1:15:56] did, it fell upon his face. Praise the
[1:15:59] Lord. Verse four say so. When Moses
[1:16:02] heard it, he fell upon his face. And he
[1:16:07] spoke unto Kora and all unto his
[1:16:10] company saying even tomorrow the Lord
[1:16:14] will show who are
[1:16:17] his and who is
[1:16:19] holy and will cause him to come near
[1:16:22] unto
[1:16:24] him. Even him whom he had
[1:16:27] chosen when he to come near unto
[1:16:30] him. Then he gave him
[1:16:32] instructions. This do take C
[1:16:38] scissors and all his
[1:16:41] company and put fire there
[1:16:44] in and put
[1:16:46] incense in them before the Lord tomorrow
[1:16:51] and it shall be that the man whom the
[1:16:53] Lord do
[1:16:56] choose it shall be
[1:16:58] holy. He take too much upon upon you.
[1:17:03] [Music]
[1:17:06] says of
[1:17:07] Levy, and Moses said unto Kora, "Here I
[1:17:11] pray
[1:17:13] you, sons of
[1:17:15] Levy, eat but a small thing unto
[1:17:19] you, that the Lord of Israel has
[1:17:21] separated you from the congregation of
[1:17:24] Israel, to bring you near to
[1:17:27] himself to do the service of the
[1:17:29] tabernacle of the Lord.
[1:17:32] stand before a congregation and minister
[1:17:34] unto them. It is seem like it was it
[1:17:40] seemed
[1:17:41] like but I it seem like these people
[1:17:44] here they had their own assumption of
[1:17:47] doing
[1:17:49] things. They decided to do things
[1:17:51] outside the will of
[1:17:52] God and they decided to gather
[1:17:55] themselves because Moses was speaking
[1:17:59] unto them.
[1:18:01] My brothers, even the Lord has appointed
[1:18:04] you. You are serving the tabernacle of
[1:18:06] God. Why have you decided to rise up or
[1:18:09] just like
[1:18:11] that? Praise the Lord. They decided on
[1:18:14] their
[1:18:15] own because the devil was leading them.
[1:18:18] Praise the Lord. Do not be of that
[1:18:21] kind. I pray thee, brother. We are going
[1:18:24] to read from this
[1:18:26] quote. The God who rich in
[1:18:29] mercy preaching
[1:18:33] 1965 we are going to read it partularly
[1:18:36] paragraph 77.
[1:18:43] It says that we could say the same thing
[1:18:46] about
[1:18:49] Kora and they are gang of unbelieving
[1:18:54] people as they try to
[1:18:57] impersonate they try to
[1:18:59] inflict something into God's
[1:19:03] program was
[1:19:05] that they could serve the people in the
[1:19:08] tabernacle but for them they decided to
[1:19:10] bring out their own
[1:19:13] program have not spoken to any of them
[1:19:16] but I just had an
[1:19:18] idea how can Moses say him
[1:19:21] alone him alone all the time why not
[1:19:24] even in fact I say all the congregation
[1:19:27] is
[1:19:28] holy everyone is free to talk to
[1:19:31] God and I didn't like a one month's
[1:19:35] program I didn't like
[1:19:37] that they had to have something to do
[1:19:43] said,
[1:19:44] "Why there is more holy men than
[1:19:50] you?" Praise the Lord. These people had
[1:19:53] more to
[1:19:54] say, not just the congression is holy.
[1:19:57] They said that you are holier than
[1:20:00] Moses. Act like you are the only
[1:20:03] on on on own and the only people on the
[1:20:09] beach and said you owe not to do
[1:20:13] that and there's more men
[1:20:16] here. And Moses known that he was to
[1:20:20] carry those children over into the
[1:20:22] promised
[1:20:25] land. The promised land was given unto
[1:20:28] him and he must pack them to the
[1:20:30] promised
[1:20:31] land. And
[1:20:33] today the only the Holy Spirit is here
[1:20:38] to vindicate God's
[1:20:40] word. And that is the eagle's
[1:20:43] wing. And we are supposed to ride
[1:20:47] on not some manmade
[1:20:50] se. But we are to ride upon the wings of
[1:20:53] the
[1:20:54] king to the promised land. Then
[1:20:58] paragraph 8 say
[1:21:00] 8 was going to get a bit of a bunch of
[1:21:04] chicken out
[1:21:08] there you know come around impersonate
[1:21:13] this eagle and they did it God said
[1:21:18] separate yourself from
[1:21:19] them and he swallowed up the
[1:21:22] world swallowed up the whole
[1:21:25] thing the
[1:21:27] ation. But God rich in
[1:21:30] mercy. Those who are trying to follow
[1:21:32] this
[1:21:33] word always God rich in
[1:21:36] mercy. Many of them come over come over
[1:21:41] on the on the side with
[1:21:44] Moses and God opened up the
[1:21:46] ark and swallowed up the
[1:21:49] unbeliever. Praise the Lord. And the
[1:21:52] same praise the Lord, brother. Praise
[1:21:55] the Lord. The same can happen
[1:21:58] today if you remain an
[1:22:01] unbeliever. There will come a time where
[1:22:04] there will be no
[1:22:06] grace. There will be no mercy.
[1:22:09] And what else? It will be the way of
[1:22:12] death. You will die. You will perish.
[1:22:16] Praise the Lord. And those who did not
[1:22:19] believe. Lord, I come out and walk for a
[1:22:23] while.
[1:22:25] But they Jesus
[1:22:27] said they they are
[1:22:30] everyone dead. Death
[1:22:34] is
[1:22:39] anhilation they are dead. Just think of
[1:22:42] that. Think of them. I mean they come
[1:22:46] out in the miracles of God in the grand
[1:22:50] hand of God. They enjoy the manner. He
[1:22:53] got out there and listened to a man
[1:22:57] named Praise the Lord that perverted the
[1:23:00] way of
[1:23:01] God by his teaching contrary to the word
[1:23:04] of
[1:23:05] God and all brethren. So let's just be
[1:23:09] together. That is the spirit that had we
[1:23:13] just the same. We are just the same. We
[1:23:16] can do things together. We are just the
[1:23:19] same. We can enjoy things together.
[1:23:23] Now the story that I gave you at
[1:23:25] first about the three friends they used
[1:23:28] to move together but their spiritual
[1:23:33] state all of them even the one claim to
[1:23:36] be a
[1:23:37] Christian even him never had Christ in
[1:23:40] him. So these people the way they were
[1:23:44] moving together I'm very sure they were
[1:23:46] saying we are together we are one people
[1:23:49] there's no need of criticizing the other
[1:23:52] only preaching against the other. Even
[1:23:55] the born again said I will also keep
[1:23:57] quiet. The Muslim say I will not speak
[1:23:59] about
[1:24:00] Islamic but the one who claimed that God
[1:24:03] does not
[1:24:04] exist could have spoken
[1:24:07] more and could have said we are
[1:24:10] together. Let's let's move together.
[1:24:13] Let's do things together because these
[1:24:15] people always in that
[1:24:17] street. They like moving
[1:24:19] together. Whenever they call them for
[1:24:21] work, you see them moving together. I
[1:24:24] don't know why do they discuss all the
[1:24:26] time. Praise the Lord. None of them had
[1:24:29] anything which was
[1:24:31] good. They have all decided to take the
[1:24:35] sin. I keep praying for them. May the
[1:24:38] Lord be merciful to them.
[1:24:41] Then verse uh chapter I mean paragraphs
[1:24:44] 82
[1:24:45] says there is another balam system
[1:24:48] rising
[1:24:50] up today let's all get
[1:24:53] together it will not work let's work
[1:24:57] with the
[1:24:58] eagle eagle you are
[1:25:03] eagleise praise the
[1:25:05] lord there is only three saved out of
[1:25:09] the entire
[1:25:11] group
[1:25:14] Moses and Joshua. The rest of them
[1:25:18] perished. Jesus said so in St. John
[1:25:22] chapter
[1:25:24] 6. God in
[1:25:26] mercy would not let them
[1:25:28] perish because with the rest of the
[1:25:32] unbelievers, they all died right there
[1:25:34] in the
[1:25:35] wilderness and they are dead. God saved
[1:25:40] Moses and the eagle
[1:25:42] believers because that they had respect
[1:25:45] to the his word.
[1:25:48] all follow the word of
[1:25:49] God. The
[1:25:51] unbelievers, the company of Kora, the
[1:25:54] company of Dan and all 120
[1:26:00] elders, all those who gathered against
[1:26:03] Moses, all the people tested of
[1:26:07] goodness all everything that God had
[1:26:10] given to the
[1:26:12] congregation. When there was time of
[1:26:15] hunger, when food was given,
[1:26:18] All of them ate from it. When they
[1:26:20] needed water, all of them had from they
[1:26:23] drank it. Praise the Lord. They saw how
[1:26:27] Moses spoke to
[1:26:29] God. So whatever Moses spoke out came to
[1:26:33] pass. I keep
[1:26:35] wondering how they from
[1:26:39] nowhere rise up and say Moses you claim
[1:26:43] too much for
[1:26:45] yourself too much for yourself. Even as
[1:26:48] we are holy, we can also speak to God.
[1:26:52] Praise the Lord. After all that
[1:26:55] time, the other day we are sharing the
[1:26:58] in home sale.
[1:27:00] We are sharing about a
[1:27:02] report how Moses sent the children of
[1:27:07] Israel to spy the land at the
[1:27:09] point and then after they came back all
[1:27:13] of them had different
[1:27:15] reports. Joshua
[1:27:17] and had a different report. The rest of
[1:27:20] the children who who were
[1:27:23] sent also had a report but their report
[1:27:27] was evil.
[1:27:29] Because the Bible says so Paul discoura
[1:27:32] the children of
[1:27:33] God because they say we are just like
[1:27:37] grasshoppers
[1:27:39] people are giants we cannot fight them
[1:27:44] we are just like
[1:27:46] grasshoppers honestly you are brother
[1:27:48] sister looking at the things happening
[1:27:51] in the
[1:27:52] world maybe sometimes you sleep
[1:27:56] hungry on
[1:27:58] self that this world is so hard that
[1:28:01] you're a child of
[1:28:02] God. Thank
[1:28:07] God rose up and he said, "We are more
[1:28:12] than able. Let's go up at
[1:28:17] one. They were more than
[1:28:19] able because they trusted on the Lord
[1:28:23] at they didn't dwell on their own ways.
[1:28:28] look at their own
[1:28:29] strength. They don't look at their own
[1:28:31] things that they
[1:28:33] had the hammer that they had. They only
[1:28:37] depended on the
[1:28:38] Lord. The Lord could deliver
[1:28:41] them. Praise the Lord. But this
[1:28:45] one from now rising
[1:28:48] up, I'm also
[1:28:50] holy. Is
[1:28:52] holy
[1:28:54] brother. Why only you always
[1:28:57] And you are the one leading us. Praise
[1:28:59] the Lord. That was an evil spirit in
[1:29:02] there. That brother or sister, you
[1:29:05] should not entertain
[1:29:06] it. Evil
[1:29:08] spirit that will rise up and even has
[1:29:12] risen up. Praise the
[1:29:15] Lord. They are trying to do all whatever
[1:29:17] they
[1:29:19] can saying that
[1:29:21] brother was not a prophet. All the other
[1:29:24] say so other one will say another
[1:29:27] thing will say another one that how
[1:29:31] comes only
[1:29:33] him
[1:29:35] messenger I'm also messenger I receive
[1:29:38] from God bring it for God praise the
[1:29:42] Lord but I want tell you in our age only
[1:29:45] one
[1:29:46] prophet only one was sent not two not
[1:29:50] three not many but only
[1:29:54] We ought to follow the message of the
[1:29:56] heart that will lead us to life and then
[1:29:59] you rise up and stand against it. You go
[1:30:03] to
[1:30:03] YouTube, you go to Tik Tok, you go to
[1:30:06] all other platforms and start posting
[1:30:09] why I left a
[1:30:11] message to begin with. You are not a
[1:30:14] message yourself. You are not
[1:30:17] converted. That's why you couldn't bear
[1:30:19] it. The true word of
[1:30:22] God is done with
[1:30:24] that because it was sent by God. Praise
[1:30:28] the Lord. For Kora
[1:30:30] decided
[1:30:32] away. Not only you even us can do it. I
[1:30:36] wanted the end of it all
[1:30:38] together. The people died. They couldn't
[1:30:41] survive. They had no way of
[1:30:44] surviving. For others were swallowed up.
[1:30:50] others a
[1:30:51] plague he came and took them. You know
[1:30:55] it is so funny these people here they
[1:30:58] couldn't learn from a first thing which
[1:31:02] happened after the heart has swallowed
[1:31:05] others after others were swallowed
[1:31:08] up they could have woken up and said you
[1:31:11] see what has happened we should wake up
[1:31:14] let's serve the go of Moses but the
[1:31:17] people continue
[1:31:18] resisting but not only you Moses but at
[1:31:21] the end of it all together Even them
[1:31:24] died. Praise the Lord. Let's follow the
[1:31:28] ways of the
[1:31:29] Lord. Praise the Lord. For God has done
[1:31:32] a lot of things for us that we cannot
[1:31:35] turn back anymore. For God has saved
[1:31:38] you. We cannot turn back
[1:31:41] anymore. For those
[1:31:45] of the God who delivered
[1:31:47] them when they reached the Red Sea, they
[1:31:51] had nowhere to go through.
[1:31:53] They had no way through and God came
[1:31:56] through Moses put the word and it was
[1:32:00] acted. Moses and Aaron working together.
[1:32:04] This happened and these are the men they
[1:32:06] stood
[1:32:07] against who brought the true message to
[1:32:09] them. The man who came and preached the
[1:32:12] good news to
[1:32:13] them who went and brought them out of
[1:32:15] the
[1:32:16] land. They forgot all those things.
[1:32:19] Praise the Lord. and they decided to
[1:32:21] rebel against us. It was in the
[1:32:24] wilderness. It was in the wilderness
[1:32:27] where they rebel against
[1:32:28] me. For us today, we are in this world.
[1:32:32] Let's not rebel against the
[1:32:34] message. Praise the Lord because we
[1:32:38] journey on the journey to the promised
[1:32:40] land. Let's not stand against his word.
[1:32:44] Let us stand with it that we may have
[1:32:47] that promised
[1:32:48] land. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:52] And today, friend, the only way that we
[1:32:55] can ever have favor with
[1:32:57] God in mercy, then we have got to
[1:33:01] respect what is said about
[1:33:04] it. You just can't take talk about take
[1:33:07] about somebody else said or what
[1:33:10] somebody
[1:33:11] said. You have got to take what God
[1:33:14] say. If these people who died with the
[1:33:18] of could only go and reason within
[1:33:22] themselves but how could he believe what
[1:33:25] is
[1:33:26] saying imagine saying that all is saying
[1:33:29] that he's only one who's
[1:33:31] holy if they could go and reason within
[1:33:34] themselves or if they could go and pray
[1:33:37] about
[1:33:38] it reasoning could come
[1:33:40] normal because they were one they just
[1:33:43] accepted
[1:33:44] it. Perhaps they had those of had a
[1:33:49] campaign. They had a small movement
[1:33:52] within
[1:33:53] themselves in the camp that they were
[1:33:55] living
[1:33:56] in. Perhaps they were moving from house
[1:33:58] to
[1:33:59] house to whisper to those
[1:34:01] people. But how comes you see Moses is
[1:34:04] saying that him
[1:34:05] alone? How do you see that thing? Then
[1:34:08] get your same spirit in that
[1:34:11] person. I've been seeing Even me I've
[1:34:15] been thinking about this. It is very
[1:34:17] true. How can Moses say him
[1:34:19] alone? Now they become two. They
[1:34:22] continued moving looking from home to
[1:34:24] home until the number became big. They
[1:34:28] saw that we cannot conquer Moses. They
[1:34:30] rose up and they rose
[1:34:32] up and imagine Kora was Moses
[1:34:36] cousin. They were
[1:34:38] cousins. He rose up against Moses.
[1:34:42] told Moses, "Not only you, but even us."
[1:34:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:49] Uh in the message, who do you say this
[1:34:53] is? Just a brief
[1:34:56] one. They followed
[1:34:58] him, but they arose up in the
[1:35:01] wilderness, one by the name of
[1:35:05] Dan and one by the name of Kora. And
[1:35:08] they said, "This has got to be a one-man
[1:35:14] affair. Moses thinks he's the only one
[1:35:17] God's
[1:35:19] called. The one message, the one
[1:35:23] message, they didn't want
[1:35:26] it. No, they didn't want
[1:35:29] it. And God never did deal deal with but
[1:35:33] with one person at a
[1:35:36] time. One man, one
[1:35:40] message. Praise the Lord. It is always
[1:35:43] one man, one
[1:35:45] message. You cannot say that even I have
[1:35:47] a
[1:35:48] message. Honestly, a person like me
[1:35:50] rising up. I have a
[1:35:53] message. People follow me and I start
[1:35:57] creating my own
[1:35:59] ways. Follow me. That way will lead to
[1:36:03] death. Praise the Lord. All those ways
[1:36:06] lead to death.
[1:36:08] But there is another
[1:36:10] way. There is another way and that is
[1:36:13] the way of a
[1:36:15] Bible. The way of a true
[1:36:17] message. If there is a way which lead to
[1:36:20] death, let us leave
[1:36:22] aside. There's a way that of a
[1:36:25] Bible which leads to death. I mean which
[1:36:27] leads to
[1:36:28] life. The way of the
[1:36:30] cross for the Lord Jesus Christ died on
[1:36:33] the
[1:36:34] cross and that is the way of true life.
[1:36:37] But he died on the cross that our sins
[1:36:40] may be
[1:36:41] forgiven and that is the way we ought to
[1:36:44] follow
[1:36:47] 53. Isaiah 53.
[1:36:51] Let us read something from there.
[1:36:55] So that we can end on the right
[1:36:58] time. Praise the Lord.
[1:37:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:05] Isaiah chapter 5.
[1:37:10] Isaiah chapter 53.
[1:37:13] We are going to read from verse three
[1:37:17] up to verse 10. The Bible says
[1:37:20] he is despised and rejected of men, a
[1:37:23] man of sorrows and acquainted with
[1:37:26] grief. And we hid as it were our faces
[1:37:30] from him. He was despised and and we
[1:37:33] esteemed him
[1:37:48] not. Surely he has bore our
[1:37:51] grief and carried our sorrows. Yet we
[1:37:54] didn't we did esteem him
[1:37:59] stricken smiten of God and afflicted and
[1:38:04] he was wounded for our
[1:38:06] transgressions. He was bruised for our
[1:38:09] iniquities tment of our
[1:38:13] peace upon him and with his stripes we
[1:38:17] are
[1:38:19] healed. All we are like sheep have gone
[1:38:22] astray.
[1:38:24] who have turned everyone to his own
[1:38:27] way. And the Lord has laid on him the
[1:38:31] iniquity of us
[1:38:34] all. He was oppressed and he was
[1:38:38] afflicted. Yet he opened not his mouth.
[1:38:42] He is brought as an a lamb to the
[1:38:46] slaughter and as a sheep before a shara
[1:38:49] is
[1:38:51] lamb openth not his
[1:38:54] mouth. He was taken from prison. He was
[1:38:57] taken from
[1:38:59] prison and from
[1:39:01] judgment. And who shall declare his
[1:39:03] generation?
[1:39:05] For he was cut
[1:39:07] off of the land of the living. For the
[1:39:10] transgression of my people, my people
[1:39:13] was his
[1:39:17] stricken. And and he made his grave with
[1:39:20] a
[1:39:21] wicked and with a rich in his
[1:39:24] death because he has done no
[1:39:27] violence. Neither was any deceit in his
[1:39:31] mouth.
[1:39:33] Yet it pleased the
[1:39:35] Lord, Bruce him. He has put him to
[1:39:39] grief. When those shall shalt make his
[1:39:42] soul an offering for
[1:39:46] sin, he shall see his
[1:39:49] seed, he shall prolong his
[1:39:52] days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[1:39:55] prosper in his
[1:39:56] land. Praise the Lord. That is the way
[1:39:59] of a cross.
[1:40:02] That is the way we ought to
[1:40:03] follow. Where the Lord died for our
[1:40:07] sins. He was stuck in a sinful
[1:40:11] man simply because we could be
[1:40:14] saved. It seemed like he's the one who
[1:40:16] did
[1:40:17] it simply because he wanted to save
[1:40:20] us. Praise the Lord. That is the way of
[1:40:23] life. The way which gave us life.
[1:40:26] There's another way. That's the way of
[1:40:30] repentance where you sincerely commit
[1:40:32] your ways to the
[1:40:33] Lord. That is the way which lives
[1:40:36] life
[1:40:38] as they are only
[1:40:40] way led to death. But here there's a
[1:40:44] true repentance. I just go to God and
[1:40:48] the spirit of pride which is rising up
[1:40:49] in
[1:40:51] me. God forgive me.
[1:40:55] God had repented that way that I'm I'm
[1:40:58] God. I'm feeling it in me. He's so
[1:41:01] proud. I'm feeling like it's all
[1:41:04] Moses. But for him, he went and told
[1:41:07] people that to be the only ones. But I
[1:41:11] want a way of true
[1:41:13] repentance and that is the way of the
[1:41:15] Lord Jesus
[1:41:16] Christ. There's a way of true
[1:41:19] baptism and true baptism in the name of
[1:41:21] the Lord Jesus Christ. That is a way
[1:41:24] which leads to
[1:41:25] life. There's a way of true
[1:41:28] obedience. Where he leads me, I will
[1:41:30] follow. When he tells me to do this, I
[1:41:33] do it. When he speaks to me in his word,
[1:41:36] I receive it and say amen to it. Because
[1:41:39] it is a way of life. That is the way of
[1:41:42] a Christian. That is why a Christian
[1:41:44] ought to live, not the way which leads
[1:41:46] to
[1:41:47] death. Praise the Lord. There's a true
[1:41:50] way of
[1:41:51] marriage. Not just moving left,
[1:41:55] right. Seek for the marriage in your own
[1:42:00] ways. This is the true way of
[1:42:02] marriage. But for you say, no pastor. I
[1:42:06] want this way which is
[1:42:08] right in your own way. You can
[1:42:12] manipulate the church. You can
[1:42:14] manipulate people. You can seek that
[1:42:16] people will not know.
[1:42:18] No one will not no one will know
[1:42:21] it. But I want you the Lord knoweth it.
[1:42:25] The Lord watches it. But there's an eye
[1:42:30] which watches you day and night. When
[1:42:32] you're in a most
[1:42:34] place when you are alone, eye is
[1:42:37] watching you. Who is watching you even
[1:42:40] in your
[1:42:41] bedroom is watching wherever you go.
[1:42:44] Even when you look left, right, see that
[1:42:47] there's no brother.
[1:42:48] I think I can speak a little. Praise the
[1:42:51] Lord. I can take a little
[1:42:54] alcohol. I can do some relationship a
[1:43:00] little. And you say, I've stayed here
[1:43:03] for about one
[1:43:05] time. There's no believer here. I can
[1:43:08] also get a
[1:43:09] girlfriend. Praise the Lord. Those are
[1:43:12] the words which lead to death.
[1:43:14] As long as you take them, they will lead
[1:43:17] to the way of death. Praise the Lord.
[1:43:20] There must be true
[1:43:21] godship. There must be true marriage.
[1:43:24] And that is the way of the
[1:43:26] Bible. Not doing things on your own. You
[1:43:30] must seek the leadership of
[1:43:32] God. The way of true and sweet
[1:43:36] fellowship. That sweet fellowship that
[1:43:38] you
[1:43:39] feel the presence of God coming down.
[1:43:44] man
[1:43:45] fellowship like this boy here who said
[1:43:47] he's a
[1:43:48] Christian for him to work in church is
[1:43:52] to
[1:43:53] dance to preach the word of God so I
[1:43:56] don't have time to preach to these
[1:43:57] people as decide but I want to tell you
[1:44:02] there's a way of true and sweet
[1:44:04] fellowship that is what the Bible
[1:44:07] says John
[1:44:10] 4:2 the Bible said but the hour cometh
[1:44:13] No is is when the true
[1:44:16] worshippers worship the father in
[1:44:19] spirit and in truth. It must be in the
[1:44:23] spirit and in the
[1:44:24] truth. Praise the Lord. You may claim
[1:44:27] that I'm woring the spirit, but it may
[1:44:30] not be
[1:44:31] true. Pentecost will claim
[1:44:34] it around making some weird noise. But
[1:44:38] they say that we're in the spirit. But I
[1:44:41] want to they are not in the spirit. They
[1:44:43] had a false
[1:44:44] spirit aloud. One time I had an
[1:44:48] encounter when I went to visit some
[1:44:55] home. My sister took me
[1:44:58] there. So when we reach home, I didn't
[1:45:01] know that this home has a
[1:45:04] church. The home compound, they decided
[1:45:06] to put a church there.
[1:45:09] So we entered to the sting room. We got
[1:45:12] all people had gone to church. All
[1:45:14] people had gone to
[1:45:16] church. So only one person was left in
[1:45:18] the
[1:45:19] house was ready to welcome us. Then my
[1:45:23] sister said, "Oh, we are going let's go
[1:45:26] to church." I said, "That's right. Let's
[1:45:28] go to church." So we went to
[1:45:31] church. So when we reach
[1:45:34] church, a lot of things were happening
[1:45:36] there. People were in different
[1:45:40] categories. The prophets on their
[1:45:45] own. Then a certain lady came to me. Who
[1:45:48] are you? An inter intercessor.
[1:45:53] Oh, which group do you
[1:45:55] belong? I was
[1:45:57] confused. I said where do I belong
[1:46:01] now? I thought maybe I was because I was
[1:46:04] behind.
[1:46:05] I thought maybe
[1:46:07] being among the common people. I didn't
[1:46:10] know even behind people also had a
[1:46:14] role and for them they were
[1:46:18] intercessors. Then they saying who are
[1:46:20] you? I didn't have a word to say. They
[1:46:24] told me go in front
[1:46:26] there. Praise the Lord. They knew that I
[1:46:28] was among the people who came for
[1:46:32] prayers. I didn't know where I belong.
[1:46:35] But they told me go in front there. I
[1:46:37] went and stood. I told him no. Sit down
[1:46:40] there. Praise the Lord. And there was a
[1:46:43] cycle of
[1:46:45] people. Even my sister was already among
[1:46:47] them. I was wondering how did she reach
[1:46:51] there. How did she reach there? So they
[1:46:54] told me sit down with
[1:46:57] pressure. So I sat down among the group
[1:47:00] of
[1:47:00] people among the
[1:47:03] circle. So as we
[1:47:05] seated those ones who were
[1:47:08] prophets, they started prophesying. They
[1:47:11] started praying for people. I was really
[1:47:13] ignorant of what was
[1:47:15] happening. How did I find
[1:47:17] myself? I was so confused. I didn't know
[1:47:20] what to do. I like running away. But
[1:47:23] I was surrounded all over. And if you
[1:47:26] try to run away, catch you as the spirit
[1:47:30] of people away. How am I going to escape
[1:47:34] from here? I just say, God, I commit my
[1:47:38] spirit to you. I have nothing that I can
[1:47:41] do. I'm in a trap. I don't know how I
[1:47:44] came here. I've been caught here. Lord,
[1:47:47] take my spirit. Help me, Lord. Now,
[1:47:51] these ladies started their work.
[1:47:53] They started pressing people's
[1:47:55] heads, pressing the body while others
[1:47:58] are washing the
[1:47:59] body. Now they were about to reach
[1:48:02] me. And I had my school fees in the
[1:48:05] pocket. People were pouring a lot of
[1:48:08] water. I was wondering whom am I going
[1:48:10] to give my
[1:48:11] school? I had a lot of notes in the
[1:48:13] pocket. I was wondering who am I going
[1:48:16] to give? There was no one. Everyone was
[1:48:19] busy in his department.
[1:48:21] I said God how much I decided to hide
[1:48:24] man a little
[1:48:27] down so that maybe water will not affect
[1:48:30] then they reached my part they told me
[1:48:34] okay they didn't say anything but I
[1:48:36] started speaking out
[1:48:37] words was pressing my
[1:48:39] head she was pressing out demons to me
[1:48:43] the lord then another one said on the
[1:48:45] legs one ran to the legs while they said
[1:48:48] to the legs another one to the legs
[1:48:51] pressing the
[1:48:52] legs while others are pouring water they
[1:48:55] pouring on the head all the shirt is wet
[1:48:59] was happening I said god I'm mercy how
[1:49:03] did I come here so these ladies were
[1:49:06] doing the all
[1:49:08] this short
[1:49:10] skirts they tried to do some covering of
[1:49:13] their
[1:49:13] skirts because their work was
[1:49:17] 2000 time they got busy
[1:49:20] the covering they had fell down. So they
[1:49:23] remain with all their short
[1:49:25] skirts trying to prophesy. So they
[1:49:28] finish on me. Then I reach on my sister.
[1:49:31] I said God help my
[1:49:33] sister. But my sister had a small belief
[1:49:37] on these
[1:49:38] people. So far she was okay with
[1:49:40] it. I didn't have it. Praise the Lord.
[1:49:44] So after all the prayers they did for
[1:49:46] all.
[1:49:48] Now the prophecies came from the main
[1:49:51] prophet. They called me in front. Please
[1:49:53] come over here. They call me in front.
[1:49:57] You come in front here. So we are going
[1:50:00] to tell you what the Lord
[1:50:02] says for you. You're a good child.
[1:50:07] But there are demons which vis you every
[1:50:11] night and you always see them. They come
[1:50:14] as
[1:50:16] bats and they come flying over you.
[1:50:19] Those are demons
[1:50:21] sent away your
[1:50:23] future. Praise the Lord. I was now
[1:50:26] quiet. I didn't say a
[1:50:28] word. They said again, your stomach
[1:50:31] always
[1:50:32] pains all the time like
[1:50:35] pain. Is it true?
[1:50:38] He said, "My stomach has taken almost a
[1:50:40] year without
[1:50:42] pain." I remember I said I was honest to
[1:50:44] myself. I was
[1:50:46] honest. The person who was next to me
[1:50:49] was trying to knock me say yes. Yes. I
[1:50:53] said no. I don't feel stomach ache. I
[1:50:56] don't even when I'm
[1:50:58] sleeping. I always sleep well and I wake
[1:51:01] up well. All those things you speaking
[1:51:04] about, I don't know. It was a burden to
[1:51:07] these people. It disturbed them. They
[1:51:10] were not
[1:51:11] settled. So I challenged them. They lost
[1:51:15] the moral of speaking about other
[1:51:18] people. They couldn't speak about others
[1:51:22] because I felt
[1:51:23] defeated. Praise the Lord. So
[1:51:26] immediately when I left that place, I
[1:51:29] ran home and pastor I believe some of
[1:51:32] you know
[1:51:34] pastor. He was staying in
[1:51:37] senior quarters. Senior senior quarters.
[1:51:40] So I ran very fast. I ran home because
[1:51:44] at the place I know as
[1:51:46] home I climbed the stairs. I went up
[1:51:49] where they stayed. They were staying the
[1:51:51] flat and I got mommy's
[1:51:54] wife in the house. I said mommy pray for
[1:51:57] me. I am finished. Pray for me mommy.
[1:52:01] They saw my body was wet. The shirt is
[1:52:04] wet. You're wondering what happened. I
[1:52:07] said today I fell into a
[1:52:09] trap. These people took me. I didn't
[1:52:12] know what to say. Praise the Lord. Those
[1:52:15] are the ways which lead to
[1:52:17] death. For as long as you follow them,
[1:52:20] they always lead to death. People
[1:52:23] creating their own atmosphere of God
[1:52:25] present. They behave like God is
[1:52:28] present. They act like God is
[1:52:31] present. Like they worshiping God in the
[1:52:33] spirit. Here they are not they trying to
[1:52:36] speak in tones and on tones without
[1:52:40] interpretation they spoke a lot no
[1:52:43] interpretation even afterwards they
[1:52:45] didn't tell us what they
[1:52:47] meant I remember even that very day
[1:52:50] after
[1:52:51] prayers they were now worshiping they
[1:52:54] were praising God I saw the brothers and
[1:52:56] the
[1:52:57] sisters dancing and they reach a point
[1:52:59] they were
[1:53:00] excited I saw them carrying each other
[1:53:02] on the
[1:53:04] A sister is carrying a brother but they
[1:53:06] are not
[1:53:07] married. They are not
[1:53:09] married. That is the spirit of God
[1:53:12] moving. When the prophets said as they
[1:53:15] were worshiping, God is saying to the
[1:53:18] all the
[1:53:19] prophets, pray for one another, pray for
[1:53:22] one another. So they have to catch up
[1:53:23] with one another. Two two. If you find a
[1:53:27] man, that is the one you pray with. Find
[1:53:29] a woman, that's the one you pray with.
[1:53:31] So the most of them for them found
[1:53:34] themselves they were with a woman and a
[1:53:37] man things were
[1:53:39] happening. I'm wondering that God have
[1:53:42] mercy the world is lost. The way they
[1:53:45] were acting the way they behaving a man
[1:53:49] said the Holy Spirit is telling him
[1:53:52] massage a
[1:53:53] lady. So he started doing it. The Holy
[1:53:57] Spirit is
[1:53:58] saying carry on your
[1:54:00] back. Put on your
[1:54:03] back. I said what's happening? A lot was
[1:54:07] happening. The generation of
[1:54:10] evildoers claiming to worship
[1:54:12] God yet they are not worshiping God
[1:54:15] claiming to be in the spirit yet they
[1:54:18] are not in the spirit. Up to today when
[1:54:21] I go to that home I don't look the
[1:54:24] same. For me these days I go in a
[1:54:28] different
[1:54:28] spirit. I tell them that the spirit that
[1:54:31] I have is not as a spirit that you have.
[1:54:35] So now they take me as a reject in their
[1:54:38] home. Even when I visit them sometimes I
[1:54:42] feel like I'm I'm not like
[1:54:45] welcomed because I am quite different
[1:54:47] from them. Praise the Lord. I really
[1:54:50] accept to be different from
[1:54:52] them because I found the truth.
[1:54:55] Praise the Lord. Our founder will accept
[1:54:58] me
[1:54:59] free. Praise the Lord. The way of
[1:55:02] fivefold
[1:55:04] ministry. Everyone fit into his right
[1:55:08] place. Not a brother struggling to be
[1:55:10] like
[1:55:12] brother putting yourself into a
[1:55:15] position which the Lord has put in the
[1:55:17] church. That is a true way of the Lord.
[1:55:21] That's the true way of the Bible.
[1:55:23] Praise the Lord. We ought to move in a
[1:55:26] true
[1:55:26] way and the true way is in the way of
[1:55:29] the
[1:55:30] Lord and worship the Lord in the spirit
[1:55:33] and in the truth. We ought to be
[1:55:35] obedient to the word of God, following
[1:55:38] what he says and doing what he
[1:55:41] says. When he tells us go
[1:55:44] here to do it, just do it in simplicity
[1:55:48] and the Lord will always help you. Try
[1:55:50] tell someone about the Lord Jesus
[1:55:52] Christ.
[1:55:53] That is the true way of the Lord and the
[1:55:55] true of the
[1:55:57] Bible follow because at one time even me
[1:56:03] I didn't follow that way. I was
[1:56:05] following the way of the world. I was
[1:56:08] following the way of
[1:56:10] Catholism. I just love to go to
[1:56:12] church and I could just sing. I could
[1:56:16] just come back the normal way I was.
[1:56:19] Nothing happened. Everything continued.
[1:56:22] When the sister comes and teaches you
[1:56:25] about to praying the
[1:56:28] rosary bits, everything was going on
[1:56:31] like that. But there was no change. And
[1:56:35] when I found a true
[1:56:36] way, I found life. Praise the Lord.
[1:56:40] Because the true way will take us to
[1:56:43] heaven.
[1:56:45] The true way will make us make us meet
[1:56:48] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:56:51] The true way will give you true marriage
[1:56:54] if you want it. The true way will give
[1:56:57] you a job. The true way will bring your
[1:57:01] Holy Spirit down into your heart. And
[1:57:04] that is a true way that we ought to
[1:57:07] follow. Now we can go back to the other
[1:57:10] story. And there is a word that seem
[1:57:12] right until the
[1:57:14] man. But at the end of it all together,
[1:57:17] it leads to death. Now if it leads to
[1:57:20] death, there must be another way which
[1:57:24] leads to life and that is the way of the
[1:57:26] lord. God bless
[1:57:29] you. Let's pray. Dear father in
[1:57:33] heaven say thank you for your
[1:57:36] grace for your love for your mercy for
[1:57:40] your kindness Lord that you loved us
[1:57:42] before the world and you predestinated
[1:57:46] us oh Lord. Now we are here as your
[1:57:48] children. We commit our ways unto you.
[1:57:52] Let them be the ways of the Lord. Not
[1:57:54] the ways of not the ways which lead to
[1:57:57] death but voices which lead to life and
[1:58:01] life eternal. Lord come down. Visit each
[1:58:04] and every one of us in our places of
[1:58:07] work in our places of stay where we
[1:58:10] sleep. Lord Jesus Christ the way that we
[1:58:13] take the be Lord Jesus Christ. We pray
[1:58:16] Lord always be in our leadership. Help
[1:58:19] us oh Lord Jesus Christ. Lead us oh
[1:58:21] Lord. Father give us your ways oh Lord.
[1:58:24] The way of true repentance oh alone. The
[1:58:27] way of genuine fellowship alone. The way
[1:58:30] of true repentance alone. The way which
[1:58:32] will take us to heaven. When we all get
[1:58:34] unto heaven we shall sing glory and
[1:58:37] glory for the Lord is good because you
[1:58:40] have given us a true way. Father I want
[1:58:42] to say thank you. good and you're
[1:58:44] wonderful in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:58:46] Christ I pray.
[1:58:48] Amen.

[1:58:51] Martin

[2:07:38] Precious Lord Jesus, we come before thee
[2:07:41] Lord. We thank you Lord Jesus Christ for
[2:07:44] this evening.
[2:07:47] Thou has spoken to our hearts
[2:07:49] Lord for is Lord the Bible says that
[2:07:52] where the body is that is where the
[2:07:54] father the eagles gathered you've
[2:07:57] brought us this day to gather around
[2:07:59] your word and you've never gathered us
[2:08:02] in vain Lord
[2:08:04] Jesus precious father you have spoken to
[2:08:07] our
[2:08:07] hearts you have corrected us where we
[2:08:10] have gone
[2:08:11] wrong you have rebuked us from our ways
[2:08:14] Lord which seemth right unto Yes. And
[2:08:19] Lord, you say that Lord, if we don't
[2:08:21] want correction that we then we are
[2:08:23] reprobate, Lord, but you say thy sheep
[2:08:26] hears thy voice and they cannot follow
[2:08:29] the voice of the
[2:08:31] stranger. Lord
[2:08:33] Jesus, it's because you are yours.
[2:08:36] That's why thou has corrected us this
[2:08:38] evening. Forgive us, Lord, where we have
[2:08:41] been in our own ways. We ask you to
[2:08:45] forgive us and bring us back to the
[2:08:48] right path. You said in
[2:08:51] Jeremiah that go stand at the junction
[2:08:55] and ask for that old way and walk
[2:08:59] therein and thy soul shall find
[2:09:02] rest. Precious father, bless the vessel

[2:09:23] wife, King of glory. We pray that may
[2:09:26] you do them good. My master may your
[2:09:29] glory Lord always be upon him Lord and
[2:09:32] his family. We pray that Lord will
[2:09:35] enlarge his territory that'll always use
[2:09:38] him Lord Jesus to speak your oracles
[2:09:40] Lord. Father bless all the ministers of
[2:09:43] this church and the lady. Precious
[2:09:46] father you say it in your word that
[2:09:48] should not only be hearers of the word
[2:09:51] but doers of word. Help us to be doers
[2:09:54] of the word. That is the desire of our
[2:09:57] heart. Even as we leaving this place
[2:09:59] going back to homes we pray that may the
[2:10:02] same presence of God the same angel of
[2:10:04] the covenant. You say that behold I send
[2:10:07] my messenger before you. May the same
[2:10:09] angel protect us tonight and lead us
[2:10:12] back home. Lord, precious father, king
[2:10:15] of glory. Bless the music team, those

[2:10:34] his life, the same grace will even be
[2:10:36] with him where is Lord as Lord is
[2:10:39] preparing soon father to come back home.
