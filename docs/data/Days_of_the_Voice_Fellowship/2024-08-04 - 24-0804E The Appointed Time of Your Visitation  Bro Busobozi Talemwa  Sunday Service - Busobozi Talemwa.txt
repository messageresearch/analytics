seated for just a few moments I'd like to greet all of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ are you happy to be in the house of the Lord ask your neighbor you happen to be in the house of so this morning by the grace of God he has given us an opportunity to be here myself and team of Three Brothers really before because our brother Ed also joined us praise pra and also brother yeah brother danand Dan we started on our journey to uh to t region we we that was Monday and we arrived there Monday night so on Tuesday morning we we we were given an opportunity to meet uh more than 100 pastors from all over T who had come to meet with us and um you know and also receed books so we were I was speaking to them about the importance of the message and um not only the importance of the message that we have received but also the importance of reading and listening to the message and um also we took with us um close to 2000 Church age books was translated by our translation team uh into ATO language so we now actually we've translated very many messages I remember when we were that team I [Music] was at that time he was working with me like brother Dan and they we had we made a team of about five so they've translated almost more than 200 messages into a t but the church ede book this specific Church ede book was done many years ago [Music] but it was out of print so we just put it back again into print and and our brothers before that edited it actually Pastor is the one who edited so um so we we we met also the translators and um we we had a little talk with them uh clal Bible Way has been sponsoring the um uh the translation and the printing of the message but they only can translate only only only so many so but they've done a good work because they don't read the our languages but they they give the money for that amen we need to give them a CL for but so I spoke to the ministers the pastors the translators about the need of having to now bring the burden over to the local people now so that now everyone can contribute just you know came off with that idea it just came to me at that moment as we were discussing and I asked them how much can each contribute if we were to ask every individual to contribute and one brother said a figure when we multiplied it we noticed it can continue to sustain the translation so I will not speak much being that we have not brought it to the pastors yet and we also so the pastors need to bring it to their people theyed over about 2,000 books they took around took to their churches also from there we before we continued to carja We visited a family been streaming our services here and uh if you remember there is a brother who contacted me through the contact of sister Stella this time around we were able to go and visit him his family he owns some I think it's like a dispensary or I don't I don't so we visited him and shared the message he's an Anglican and he decided to be baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus so um unfortunately we never had a moment to conduct the baptism but we trust that the Lord will continue following up that that brother will probably meet again with his family so from there we continued to kja now is a whole different story because the people there are more the pastors were more the needs were more we literally ran away because no one wanted us to leave but we had to be here this weekend and um also of course the many other factors that couldn't allow us to stay for longer uh but we we met in t we met I I was just estimating but probably I did not get a chance to look at the registration but I am certain it was more than 200 pastors and these came from all the regions of uh one region that did not send someone is a um but also I spoke to the brother there who is planting a church there brother jrey has s Le for us in one of the youth meetings so we um we sent him do we remember how many books we sent him which is how many books do the math and let me know so we we we sent we sent him several um hundreds of books into we this translation was done from scratch by our team there the the team we made of about five people as well and they have been translating the message into yeah we sent him 168 books but the the books we took in 5,000 books wait all these 5,000 books are going to be given to believers who can read so there other believers who cannot read so you can imagine how many Believers are in isn't it amazing it's amazing there quite very many believers from all regions we met we met pastors from all regions I don't have the districts on here but I can remember if few um is the T side UMO um you know napak nap Moro and um you remember some districts several other districts I have the list of them here so they all came and we had a very wonderful conversation with them we we diverted a little bit in our conversation because these pastors coming together some others did not want others to be in the meeting because they were saying those ones have a wrong Doctrine and they had excommunicated them and when you talk to them you also hear that there's a problem with the other people's understanding of the message so you found there are many issues uh but um these are people who truly love the message uh but by God's grace they were all able to stay in the meeting and one thing I told the ministers the pastors there is that the message correct the error you see it was good that all of them stayed all of them received the message let them go and read it the message will correct the wrong doc the more you read the message the more you understand the message properly there were some other ministers that wanted us to stay because they had issues also with the understanding of the message wanted us to discuss a little more with other pastors uh especially on the issue of hair it's a very big problem there and and marriage I think and divorce but um I wasn't constrained to stay I felt I needed to move God's grace we shall return this brother told me pointed at me said you have gone but I also failed I needed to stay but I wasn't constrained to stay so uh butth the brothers know what I'm talking about literally we escaped uh because the need there is great not the need for money or for water and food but the need for the one they need for the word so we need how many are going to pray for amen the pastors there have a big heart for god um actually I spoke to them also about now translating the message into their own language by themselves and they told me they let they will update me but they agreed imagine Believers there will begin contributing money to support their translators to translate the message I believe it will be a wonderful thing amen I believe it will surely be a wonderful so previously before we started translating in and we previously started translating in luganda and I remember there there some years ago uh when I had gone to minister spe Tabernacle there's a brother that came to me and told me brother I've heard you do translations in Ethiopia I would we have a burden of translating this Mage he told me I have been translating it before but I feel that we need to resume but we do not have support and you have brothers who can help us trans told him I don't I can't promise but later on I went on to discuss the matter with our brother Tim and he agreed and we constituted a team of five translators I believe it was that's the first time I think I also met with Brother who happened to be one of those on that team and another one and this actually brother who spoke to me at the church there his name is brother he was the brother he the brother who has just passed away the father to Sister es and so he really did a great work in Translation right until his last time so um we we have lost a soldier a man who had a burden for this message and today after the service at 4 p.m. Brother Martin um are there any changes yeah 4 p.m. is the barrier time so um I'm told we need to go earlier yeah are there are there arrangements for transportation but we shall make them immediately after service after the service okay the announcements will be made after the service amen so um for for those who want to go for the barri to not only support our sister Esther also stand behind a soldier someone who really stood for this message amen you know the last time I saw brother mu visited his house myself and brother martin and he was in pain a lot of pain you know this is someone who had different you know ailments in the body and um lot of complicated things in his body uh but um the pain was too much um and so that's the but I got that moment I told him brother God is one thing I know it is God's will for you not to have pain I told him that I said whether he's going to take you or you're going to stay in this you must not suffer you must not have pain and I'm going to pray with you that God will take away the pain and I want to say stand before all of you sister eser kept on updating us from that time to the time of his passing he did not have pain actually there's a doctor who visited and when he checked he said how come he's not in pain God took away the pain amen and I believe that you know it doesn't matter how we live this world it might be sickness unto death it might an accident like brother bam went in an accident it might be you know Murder like John the Baptist was cut off the it might be anyway it doesn't matter how we get out of this there is another life after and that's the hope of every believer it doesn't matter what we Face here it matters where we are going and that's why we come here to make our ready for that place there's a brother Francis is a father to uh brother Brian I would like us to receive him today brother Francis if you can raise up your hand God bless you he was here last Sunday but we forgot to make mention of that and you remember when we went to Loro last time with our sister who had come from uh what's the country Norway yes so we uh met a family there prayed with them accepted baptism and this young man here is one of them if you can stand just right here God bless you amen is a daughter a son to sister haret sister is here I did not even you here God bless you amen I thought you had traveled back nice to see you today so sister Harriet is a sister to uh I forgot the name of the Sister Sister Lan yes sister so um and we are happy that you've been able to locate the fellowship so they live she lives in L but the young man lives here with some of the relatives we will plan on getting him baptized as soon as possible well a lot of preliminaries but shall we now stand and U just get into the word this morning so literally from Monday morning I've been from last Sunday been very busy until today so I'm not very very strong in the body but I ask that you pray with me because I have some message that the lord gave me to give to you this morning we going to read in the book of habac I think this is the first time I'm preaching out of that book and I'm sure many people don't know where the book is it sounds funny in luganda so yesterday we were also at sister Angela's home together with brother St and the sister Angela's husband brother together with a people they had visited um uh the the the home and uh by God's grace I was given an opportunity to minister to all the two sides both the family of the of the brother and the family of sister and I can all I can say the seed was sown the seed was sown very properly we should wait for the increase amen amen so uh sister Angela sends greetings she's not able to be here this morning but she was happy that we were able to represent you and um we are reading from ABAC everybody is there in abaku or are not yet there I some are still opening like myself here brother shim can you please correct correct that yeah okay I'm now finally there we are reading only uh three verses while we are coming back we passed by Brother AA and sister Charity's home and uh we had a very wonderful moment there of worship the week has been so amazing I hope you too was amazing praise the Lord amen I have too much to say really but let us first read then we sit and hear what the we are reading from verses two and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may re run that readeth it for the vision is yet for unapp appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not t [Music] behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith amen let us pray father we ask your blessings upon the preaching of your word may you have your way we ask it in the name of Jesus CHR amen please be seated if you have a chair in front of you please change your place and take the front position I believe I'm speaking to Believers I'm not speaking to a crowd I'm speaking to a congregation if you have a chair in front of you just take it before I get into the message this morning I noticed I had something outlined here I needed to tell you you one brother Andrew of course as we told you last Sunday he was moved over to moroto so we actually met there he reported to duty there but we didn't have time to have a chat because we were really very busy but at least we had time to have supper together in one of the days with him and also to connect him with the Believers that side it was it was a very good thing God bless you those who were contributing to the land fund um I I I made a few remarks I think last Sunday about those online and I said don't just enjoy the word also give now um we do not know but we have an online giving platform uh brother Isaac you can actually put that for the people onl we have video and links for people so there's somebody who gave more than 2.9 Million sh this we um I personally do not know the person I have never met them I don't know them they've not but they gave so maybe they've been following the services silently and they gave silent maybe they looking at me right now I I saw their name but I don't know it I say God bless you again may you may you may you also say to to her God bless you amen towards she gave that much towards our land F actually more than 2.9 maybe about 3 almost two but the problem is the charges on that plat but what I can say see God will send us people who don't even know to accomplish this Vision we have written down the vision it will be accomplished so you who is a member of the church don't sleep wake up I noticed there's another brother in um in um what's the place uh West N I think some place he he he he he put up a picture and he wrote Days Of The Voice Fellowship fellowship and he said come support our land f one of the teams is giving us streams the services online some brothers were asking me is this how the church is going to look like whoever sees that picture we as a church have nothing to do with it the brother just maybe made it up and to ask his friends to give praise the name of the Lord God will send friends amen God will send people as long as the vision and the bur of the Lord will send people to make sure it is accomplished praise the name of the Lord and so um this morning I'm going to speak to you on a subject that I feel is special and I believe that it will be a blessing to uh to all of you this morning because of the funeral service in the afternoon I'm not going to be very long so it's almost 12 so I see I may not even speak for an hour and a half so just pray with me pray for me listen to the word prayerfully this morning amen you've had a long week but can we now concentrate and listen to what the Holy Spirit has for us I'm going to speak to you on the appointed time of your visitation tell your neighbor tell your neighbor the appoint time of your Vis praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah our god is not a theologian our God is a Believer a believer of his own word when he gives his word he can't go back against you I am the word of God made manifest I was appointed to live in this house so that I can overcome because he said in in every age there are Overcomers if you read the book of Revelation you will find it says to they that will overcome they will sit with me on my Throne this is generation so I am appointed in this generation to overcome so I am here not to be defeated but I am here to defeat every Power of darkness and every Spirit of this world every pride of life every lust of the eyes every lust of the flesh I am here to overcome now overcoming means I'm going to fight with it overcoming means I'm going to go through it but overcoming means I am predestinated I am appointed to live in this generation not to be overcome but to overcome there are those who were made for the purpose of being overcome like pharaoh for example Pharaoh was not meant to overcome Pharaoh was meant to be overcome even God hardened his heart so that he can be overcome very well you know sometimes that God hardens you know the hearts of people that were meant be your enemies so that you can then prepare a table for you in the midst of them otherwise if you did not have enemies how can the power of God be seen God allowed someone to be with you so that after you have overcome their witch your God can be seen many times when someone bees someone they and and their witchcraft doesn't work it was meant to kill you and then doesn't kill you then they will come to you and they will say you are a witch because they think every other power is the power of Witchcraft they don't know we have another power back at home we used to have a neighbor and this neighbor was a witch well it is not very rare to have a neighbor who is a witch how many have ever had a neighbor who a some of you have lived in London you have no wit but we had a neighbor who was a we but in our home we were very prayerful and we never feared witches Believers don't fear witches no no no we don't fear witches so would be and be and be and also she was a night dancer so at night she would dance and come and dance around the door of our house so you would hear that she's now outside you know she's beeing beeing beeing but you know the more she would be the more powerful we would become our mother told us to pray our father told us to believe the word so we remained firm and so she began to call us witches but she did not realize we had another God who was more powerful than her witchcraft praise the name of the Lord so if you are appoint age also he or she has a visitation that has been appointed to happen at an appointed time sometimes you can pray for things and even fast and those things don't get to happen and then you wonder what is wrong with me some of you even begin blaming God but let me tell you

spiritual I took time praying for a there was a time I even looked at cars like and I said oh my God I you say in all Riches of Heaven you can't at least speak at a woman give it to me but God said

time for their visitation otherwise God will not give me this message today amen why is he anointing me to speak today God is visiting somebody but you must have a revelation listen when God visits you and you refuse him and you refuse his time and you refuse his Vis let me tell you what will happen will be back we see there was Jesus as he was walking and then he found a tree was it a manga tree or and when he found it it was not having fruits let me ask you was it the season for the tree to have fruits Bible readers tell me the tree was big enough but was it it season yes or no yes or no yes or no yes or no all right the Bible says it was not the season for the tree to bring forth Freedom it was not what the Tre season amen I'm burning up with re it was not the Tre season but it was the season of the maker of so when he came he desired for and the tree was like it's not my season and he said no it is your I want what are you talking about telling me you could judge the tree he could judge the tree and yet it wasn't the tree yeah because he is the maker of the tree it is not the tree season it is his season the season of the make of the tree are you hearing me and he told it because you have no fruit from today from today because you have rejected me no man will ever eat of you again my God and the disciples thought he was joking and when they passed by that side again they found the tree was dry brother sister if you want to dry spiritually if you want to dve physically when God visits you reject it then you will dve you will no longer have progress you will pray and fast but you are dry nothing can come out of you but the Bible says blessed is the man that WTH not in the councel of the ungod nor standeth in the way of sinners sth in the seat of the SC but his Delight is in the Lord in the law of the Lord and in his law in his word does he meditate day and night you don't meditate in what they say you don't meditate in what your flesh tells you you meditate in the word of God what the word of God says about you and he oh God this man this man shall be like a tree planted by the rivers that amen that bringeth forth oh my God am that bring for his fruit his fruit in his season no you did not interpret it correctly listen he did not say it bringeth forth its fruit in its season but he said oh my God oh my God oh my God oh you have to excuse me this is burning me up he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth he the fruit he the he everybody say in his season who fruit amen the fruit of God Who season the season of the bringer of the F blessed is the man who was not in the C of the UN but he will be like a tree planted by the rivers of water who will bring forth fruit in his season God is fruit in the season of God when it is his appointed time amen your visitation will come and when it comes don't reject it don't Harden your heart accept it don't say it's not time yet God Is Yet To Work The Best Is Yet To Come no When God says now is the time then now is the time God works in the now he waits and wait for the appointed time his appointed time and when it has come for you you should never say no because his time has come and his season has come and your visitation has come receive it believe it accept it and watch God accomplish it now now listen let's take this a step higher I want to show you an example here of a vision that God WR before its appointed time from there I will show you when the appointed time had come my God people who are ready today to be ho rers there is no better service prepare your mind because this I tell you is finishing Isaiah 7: 10 verse to verse 14 moreover the Lord spake again unto a saying of course speaking by the mouth of Isaiah ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God ask it either in the depth or in the height above but I has said I will not ask neither will I tempt the Lord uhhuh now here ah refused to ask for a sign okay verse 13 and he said please listen to me he ye now oh House of David is it a small thing for you to warry man but will you warry my God also there the Lord himself shall give you a sign you can read up to there tell your neighbor the Lord himself shall give you a sign oh my if they're not hearing tap them again tell them the Lord himself shall give you a sign now listen what is the sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall and and shall call his name emmanu what was this a sign what was this a sign who gave the sign God himself hey when God gives a sign he says it is a vision now write it down how many of you has God given a sign about their life how many have visions that you know must happen in your life hallelujah hallelujah when go when God shows you signs and vision when it shows you signs it becomes a vision I don't know how to explain it it becomes a vision and then you have to write it down many times when prophetic utterance comes it used in Ethiopia what we Believers used to do is to take it and write it down when sometimes even God here speaks through maybe a tongue or through prophet interpretation of don't just here and leave it there let us have spiritual women and men who will pick up their pen and write those those Visions Because by the time it is uttered as as out of the mouth of God it becomes a vision which is going to happen but it has not yet but it will happen so you have to write it down he said in the word that for the vision is yet for una appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie so when you write it down you believe it shall happen God is appointed time it may be something you want in the normal life maybe you want to buy a house don't fear if God has revealed it to you your faith has given it to you you have it already somebody else doesn't believe for it somebody else doesn't even believe they can buy land of their own but when God reveals it to you brother pick up a pen and paper write down the vision I will build a house I will do marage some people don't even feel like marriage but if God reveals it to you you are going to get married you're going to be a mother you're going to be a father write it down I will get married I will have five children I will raise them in the fear of the Lord I will I will I will what is it it is a vision it is a vision that God has made known to you amen and when you write it down your work then is to wait wait for God his appointed time so he told if you won't ask for a sign I will give you a sign the Lord himself shall give you a no man can give you a vision only God if your faith believes for it then it is yours then it is yours if your faith believes you are going to be a rich woman a rich man it is yours there are some there is someone who will never believe it if your faith believes you going to excel in school it is yours if your faith believes I am getting married this year when it comes as an inspiration it is a sign it is a vision write it down write it down write it down write it down I was 19 years old and I was in university and as I went to zimb to Minister preach the gospel as a young boy who is in school when I was there serving God it came to me as a sign that I will be a preacher that I will travel the world for the purpose of this message it came to me as a vision I saw my future literally I saw today literally before it happened and I was so you know full with this Vision I wrote it down I began realigning my life I came back to my mother I told her mom I'm quitting school why because I'm getting married why are you getting married I said because God has revealed to me I'm going into Ministry and if it is true I need to realign my life I need to prepare myself for the vision which God has no one believed me at the time but it was a vision it was a sign that come from the supernatural now that's only my testimony but I'm showing you here another testimony in the word Behold a virgin shall conceive that was a sign therefore it was a vision and it was written down by prophet Isaiah Hallelujah when Isaiah saw it Isaiah wrote it down here in Isaiah chapter do you think it was the end God kept on showing him Isaiah 9:6 again he burst out with another sign and another prophetic sign and vision for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called Wonder wonderful the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with Justice from hence forth and forever this man was speaking things he had never seen before this man had seen a vision this man had been given a Sign by God and he began writing it down to us a child is born us a son is given a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and he shall call his name Emmanuel amen his name Shall be Called wonderful coun Mighty God the ever father the prince of peace and then listen he begins to talk about this man's government he says the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end in the first Vision he he said these words the government shall be upon his shoulder are you following me church he spoke his word by a prophet it looked like impossible when he said a Virg shall conceive the vision was appointed for a specific time and kept written down now there were many interpretations when you read through these Visions there are many interpretations I believe that men had but the scripture said the Zeal of the Lord of host read it read it continue There the Zeal of the Lord of host will perform [Music] this oh my God Hallelujah the Zeal of the Lord of hosts theal the of not just the Lord but the Lord of H the Zeal of the Lord of will accomplish the vision when God gives you any Vision do not disbelieve it write it down amen and for thus sayith the Lord the Seal of the Lord of H will that is how God works the Zeal of the Lord of host was going to perform this it was going to happen there many men who would have come and a virgin shall conceive maybe he means a girl who was a virgin and then she'll get a man and conceived by him and maybe they interpreted it said brother read he's not saying a woman who is a virgin he's saying a woman who is a virgin will lose our virginity and conceive you can interpret it that way maybe they interpreted it that way she'll get a man and conceive but God had said it and the prophet had written it down on a paper it was now a vision not subject to editing not subject to explaining not subject to doubting but subject to happening the only thing that they were now waiting for is to see the vision happening let us see how will God bring it to pass he will bring it to pass with the Zeal of the Lord the Lord of H now in the message proving his word people doubted people disbelieved it others preached it without understanding like a customary for people to read it the Virgin shall conceive and a child a virin maybe many Rose up oh someone came up and they began making comedy out of it said are you a virgin yes then go in a room then come out to the baby ah a virin and a baby is and they began ridiculing the prophecy they began ridiculing the vision but that did not stop God from accomplishing the vision listen when God says something he does not need a man's interpretation how God interpret something by making it come to amen listen my God in the message proving is word says doubting ages and things that we have went through and live in today we face all these things the worst of all in the face of all this doubt God does go right on proving his words to be right you didn't hear it did God goes right on proving his words to be right as he has in every age listen listen listen unbelief does not stop God somebody to dance on Bel does not stop it does not hinder him I don't care how much the world unbel what is said is going to happen and it's going to happen unbelief doesn't do nothing but condemns the unbeliever praise God if I came to my wife told her dear the Lord has spoken to me you are my wife and she said no that isn't God all of you now know she would not have been beli God has spoken to me not her she has to walk into the vision of God I'll show you right down here she has to walk into but if she doesn't it cannot hinder [Music] [Applause] God if God tells you to give brother or sister so and so one million shs you will know because you have a sign so you will walk be in the vision and you will know it is God God has spoken to to give the seed of this brother so and so or to the ministry or to the land F or whatever if you in your heart I will not do it it will not hinder God God is God tell your neighbor God is God unbelief does not do nothing but Dems the unbeliever the unbeliever will send the unbeliever the unbelief will send the unbeliever to hell it will rob him of Every Blessing God promised to him but he doesn't hinder God from going right on with the believer unbelief doesn't stop it only stops the unbeliever amen at a pastor of this church God showed me a vision that we shall have a land of our own we shall have a church of Our Own It is a vision I've it down whoever is supporting it is walking into that Vision but let me tell you church I love you very much but whether you do or not support it it will not hinder the vision of power whatever God has said master and will always happen praise the name of the Lord now I want to read for you for you from the Philadelphian Church age in it says here now it says in Isaiah 22:22 1222 oh excuse me 2222 it says and the key of the House of David will I lay upon his shoulder put the SC will I lay upon his shoulder amen can you put up the scripture right okay you put up the message it's in the Bible you can check it out okay and the key of the House of David I lay upon his shoulder so he shall open please listen be attentive and None Shall shut and he shall shut and None Shall open what does it the Key of David now the spirit of the spirit uses this Old Testament reference listen to these things friends it's going to mature you it's going to establish you they don't go out stay inside and listen it's just a small qut but it's going to establish it is power pack it has a powerful anointing listen as I was reading it I felt it the spirit uses this Old Testament reference concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his ministry in the church what the Key of David signified at that time is m is mere shadow which is now fulfilled in Jesus standing in the midst of the lamp stand it has to do with our Lord after his resurrection and not his Earth fine thank you but what does this key signify ask your neighbor what does this key what is the Key of David the answer lies in the position of the key where the key is it is not on his hand it is not wor around his neck it's not placed in the hands of other men or the verse could not be saying that he he alone has the use of that key for he alone opens and he alone shuts and no man has the right but Jesus himself isn't that right but the question is where is the key it is on his shoulder now while I'm reading this I want you to remember where we read in Isaiah amen he say the government shall be upon his shoulder but what does this mean the answer is this the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the [Music] East when the bride has been committed to the groom she would take a veil which was is on her head and she would place it over the groom's shoulder signifying that not only is she under his Dominion but that she has transferred his rights her rights to him are you listening to me he the man is the head but also that he be the responsibility and the care are you hearing me he bear the responsibility care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility over this woman actually that's even what marriage means and that that beloved is the Key of David listen please listen God being Sovereign he for you by Divine decree exactly who would be in his Bri am he knew he chose her everybody say he chose her he chose her she did not choose him Hallelujah sisters Hallelujah sisters he did what she did not do what she did not choose him he called her she did not she she did not come on her for her on her own for her she belongs to him and to him alone she is Holy committed to him listen to these next words and he accepts the obligation he is her head for Christ is the head of the church are you hearing some of you are not understand what I'm saying now this is going to be connected to the government being Aon Hallelujah Hallelujah and the prophet is telling us in the East when they would get married you know the woman would put a veil and put on the shoulders of to signify that no one else has responsibility over her but him and him alone no one else no other power nothing else in the same way spiritually speaking God Amen has predestinated Us in his mind how many he have given their lives to Jesus what you did it shows he knew you before you even knew no one has responsibility over you but him and him alone God being Sovereign he for Knew You by a Divine decree he knew you would be a part of his bra he chose you you did not choose him someone needs to understand that better he chose me I did not choose him brother sister don't just listen to it say it two times and you will understand what I'm talking about come on come on now he chose me I did not choose say it again come on brother you can say it he chose me I did not choose him did you get it now did you get it now he chose me I did not choose him he called me I did not call myself am what does it mean I am his vision Hallelujah I am the vision of God made manifest glory to God a man stands there he wants to get married he sees a vision of his future he sees his family he sees his children he sees his house he sees how everything is arranged and then he sees his wife and then he knows to be able to have this children and have my house arranged this way and my family this way I need to marry a woman like this Hallelujah and then he will begin looking the man not the woman he will begin looking why because it is the man that sees the vision of his future home he begins looking he begins looking and then he come to you sister fortunate forunate Hallelujah and the son of God comes forunate God has showed me I am sure it is Vindicated in me I can see it you are my wife will you please be my wife and then you be like what does it mean you have rejected the vision Hallelujah It Happened One Time there was a man who picked a woman and he was called King and you know how we loved her and this man drunk and they were happy and having a party and then he called his wife he said servant bring me my queen let everybody see her beauty hallelujah hallelujah and then when they went to where queen V was said what that King commands your presence tell the king I queen I have my own I have my own vision of what kind of man I want sister you have no choice to have a vision of your own but you have a choice of accepting a vision God has brought I prove it by the Bible here and then refused everybody said refus and when she refused the king said she's refused but I [Music] loved and the servants advised the king put her away because if you don't every woman in the Kingdom will refuse to submit to their husband said all right you can do that I love listen to me no matter how much a m loves if you can't fit his vision that marriage is gone is the man who has a vision for his home not the woman the woman has a part to play equ She fulfills the vision because the Woman's Work is to multiply you bring food Banas the dirty and all the woman will take it and she will make food and meal out Simply give a seed she multiply it she'll give you a baby child family give her a house I remember I walked into Isaac's place before he Char came in and I can tell you I can preach it here publicly it was a mess sorry brother Isaac we shall discuss later but yesterday when I walked in there oh my God it was just so beautiful why a woman has come in view how work is too much take a house give it to her she'll make it a [Music] home piig a woman give her one word of abuse she will turn it and make it to Hell take one word of love dear I love you she will take it multiply it and give you a heaven in your home A Woman's Work is to multiply it is a man's work to have a vision for what kind of house he wants to have what kind of home he wants to have I'm say I don't care what kind of man you are you may claim to be a holy ghost but we will know you by the woman you choose to be your wife if you choose a sex Queen a dor that's going around with long painted Nam and lips that look like they have blood with those Long Heels we know now what kind of man you are you are a man who has no regard for the word of God and whose vision is not to raise children that will fear God but if you choose a woman a woman reflects your character because you the vision Bearer are you hearing me young man you a vision bear your home what kind of home you want to have what kind of future do you want to have your wife reflects in the same same way here we see therefore the woman doesn't choose the man that's why if a sister ever comes to you brothers and proposes marriage to you run as fast as you can [Applause] amens from brothers are very minim were are some of you proposed to by sister brother I see you very shy come on you see sister I wanted to tell you you know don't I'm Ava [Music] sister there's a problem even you brother there's a big problem you find a brother going to a woman and he behaving like a sister you know sister and he's taking some some leaves you know Sister God is [Music] telling what kind of man are you and if find others who have a mouth full of lies you see me here I have a bungalow I have a bungalow when we marry I'll take you foron in mbasa my father's literally promised me a lot of money we are reach at our home everything is fine everything you are not a man to be there is something wrong with you you need to be born again because if you are born again you have a vision for your home and you want your wife to have confidence in you a man with knowledge will never deceive his wife is the serpent who deceived if is a spirit of a serpent and if brother you still lies you have a spirit of a and you need deliverance and you can receive it right now right here by the hearing of the word be delivered you see she belongs to him and him alone he chose her she did choose him he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and him alone she's holy committed to him and accepts the obligation he is her head for Christ is the head of the church hallelujah hallelu praise the name of the Lord the appointed time for the station of of the Virgin Camp praise the name of the Liv friends listen in the Book of Luke 1 ver 26 the time for visitation now was going to Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah a virgin sh how will it happen the Zeal of the Lord of host a virgin now you find virgins who are they putting themselves oh God I'm a vir please use me choose me you see I been fasting and praying chose me and you find a sister going in prayer oh god brother let him choose me that brother I surround him with the angels of God your prayer needs another touch the appointed time the appointed time of your visitation it is God's time not your time and when it com op no man can shut he shuts and no man can open God is appointed time must come and the vision was a virgin shall conceive and bear a son now let us see when the appointed time came Luke 1 ver 26 and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth did someone hear that come on Church you hear that you're so quiet on me at this moment when you when you hear people are quiet or becoming quiet it means the sisters are quiet s are you can we say Amen all right now I know you are there in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God under the city Nam Nazareth now we see here the angel of the Lord was what sent by who do you see any Scripture that Mary was waiting for the sister phib was Mar praying for this Angel to come what was she doing she was just going about her business and what was she she was a virgin someone should clap for that why a virgin shall conceive to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary talk about God coming to someone who is already potentially someone else's wife [Music] but she was a virgin there is a reason why God came to her there is a reason why Mary and not somebody else because oh my God had already predated this there was a connection there was a connection oh my God if you can t with me now for 20 more minutes I'll show you this thing how many want to see it all right let's go he says and Mary the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came unto her and said hail thou that highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed are thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and C her mind what manner of citation this should be and the angel of the Lord and the angel said unto her fear not Mary oh my God those sweet words oh my God praise God until today my wife remembers the words that changed her life I forget but she always reminds you know when you came to me that day and he spoke those words it turned my life my heart changed words of a man are meant to naturally move a woman are you hearing me how much more the word of God notice the way the angel came was so so lovely Fe not married he didn't come to the way to her the way he came to others fear not I'm set from the Pres of God fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God was like those words change me and behold thou sh conceive in thy wom and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father now you see where the K of of David comes we talk about the KY of David later and Reign Over The House of Jacob forever open no man shall oh my God and of his kingdom there shall be no end is this not the same prophets in the Old Testament which was in the vision of Isaiah oh my God then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be saying I know not a man and the angels answered and said unto her the ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee there also that ho thing which shall be born of thee shall be called a Son of God and behold thy cousin now I know why now I know why there is a reason why God came to Mary there was a connection amen oh my do you see it there was a connection Amen in the family of Mary amen God had a predestinated man in the family of Mary God had known Mary and God had known Elizabeth they were cousins and they were meant to live in a time when God's appointed Vision will happen it had to be married it had to be the time it could not be another time that was the time Mary either receives it or rejects it I don't believe that Elizabeth only had Mary as a cousin I believe Elizabeth had other cousins if Mary refused the angel would go to another cousin of Elizabeth even on the side of Elizabeth God was moving things and the things were planning to happen exactly at that moment the way God did his was that at this time on that at that houry was supposed to be pregnant that moment do you get it now the time had come for the vision that God showed Isaiah to be fulfilled there is much more than what I'm saying here as I'm preaching some of you look at your life I'm not just telling you history but these words are by inspiration God is speaking into your life see yourself when I'm talking about Mary don't see Mary see yourself hallelu and behold th cousin Mary Elizabeth she also has conceived the angel of God was which was going to bring results she has also conceived son in her old age and this is the six month with her why do you think the angel was telling Mary about this do you think Angels gossip there was a reason the angel was sent to bring this message he wasn't speaking his idea he was speaking the perfect will of God and Mary said and the angel said for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word the moment she said that it was done she's pregnant and the angel departed from her and Mary arose in those days and went into the hill with h into the city of Judah friends Jesus Christ something I want you to see I'm busting with this Revelation and I'm saying our time is fast but if you can give me more more moments now of your time and attention remember there was a promise for an Min in Malachi 3 that Elijah will come and shall prepare the way of the Lord who would be that man John the and Elizabeth was supposed to give birth John so that John the Baptist can lead the way of the Lord the vision had been given but here is something I want you to see God made God made Elizabeth for a long time until anointed some of you may take too long to find your lifetime partner don't be anxious be anxious for nothing there is an appointed and this goes to Sisters especially because you you have to wait marry her to wa Elizabeth to but the man makes the choice the man prays sees the vision of and moves into action but the woman has to waigh so Elizabeth was waiting maybe she pray that go TI and stopped even praying Elizabeth was no having no no child and everybody was calling a bar but it was the will of God because God appointed time had not come yet when the time had come nothing would stop Elizabeth from having a baby nothing stopped Elizabeth from becoming pregnant when the time came even when Elizabeth got the baby and the baby died in the womb God God is God he still made that life come back again God is God as long as you're walking right with him you may lose a child and you even feel like you are desperate you even feel like God is not with you let me tell you brother God makes no mistakes when it comes to children God if your life is right with him only look at Calvary he makes no mistakes in everything he does he has an appointed time you may be sick and you want him to heal you right there and then but he may wait to heal you because he's waiting for that appointed time there is something that has to connect with something for something to come out of hallelujah amen Elizabeth had to be Buren because maybe Mary was still young Mary was the one appointed to have the Messiah in Hallelujah and Elizabeth was already old grown you see God made a you cannot give birth to John before the mesiah is here John will only be born for one purpose to prepare the way of the Mah and before the woman who is going to give birth to the Messiah is born and before she grows I will lock up your stomach because your stomach is Holy supposed to bring forth my Prophet who will do a job no other Prophet has ever done Zarah was there praying Elizabeth was there praying God did not answer that prayer until the appointed time when Mary grew maybe her parents moved quickly to make her get married to J and God when he saw that my time has come let me Rush before corrup her he sent the Angel and the angel I am sent from the presence of to tell you you will have a child in your wom and you'll call his name Jesus Will these things be don't worry there's nothing impossible with power of the Holy Ghost will will I can't understand it but be me to your word moment Joseph never touched her because God spoke to him Hallelujah are you following me oh my God hallelujah I'll give this testimony it's not mine but brother Tim has given it before the man who wed me and my wife his name is brother Tim he's from Canada he was a pastor of a church in another region in the north married with eight children his wife died just like that his children are all big one of them was even at my wedding now there was meanwhile a sister in the church another church church of brother Eddie bis that time she was the secretary her name is I don't need to mention name and so this sister was not married for many years but faithful and Faithfully serving God not living a life not living in immorality but living virtuous waiting for the appointed brother Tim told me while his wife was dying that same day this sister sah I mentioned her name in their Church she was actually singing a special song now I don't remember but the song was talking about him and our future husband and at that moment the other sister was dying later on but the team moved to this church by invitation to lead missions in the church and he left the other Church to be and in this church where he he ends up Maring this sister the sister was I think even over 40 I think mhm God disappointed time sister m a sister in Ethiopia she was living in Kenya Faithfully serving God working for almost more than 10 years in a very good bank earing a good Serv and she was working there and whole time she was serving God she worked money she even had a car of she had a house of her own she was supporting her family Highly Educated big salary no husband but living virtuous and Faithfully to the Lord and she was praying oh God I'm waiting I'm ready when he comes I'm waiting I'm ready and I am in Ethiopia and we are preaching and evangelizing from the time the sister was about I think 20 she was waiting but her husband had not even believed yet her husband didn't even know there is a message so God had to make Mery weight [Music] give her everything she needed but said on this issue so she also waited and left all other boys and waited for the perfect and when this moment came brother morgus wanted to to be married and all the sisters in the church he didn't choose any maybe tried to talk to a few but it wasn't his vision turn them down came to me and said my wife is not here but my wife is somewhere serving God in a church of the message somewhere it was not told him it came to him as a revelation as a sign during a preaching like this and he wrote it down he continued confessing and in the first wedding in the church this sister shows up and the brother said one day I turn my eyes and I will see her it was a revelation it was a vision to him had not seen it happen but he believed for it and here is the sister in the church she's crying on Sunday morning after the wedding the previous day they TR from Kenya a big group and she was one of them she was crying crying and I was on the pull pit and we were all crying and when when we started talking to the people we raised our heads and we cleaning our eyes andus was on my right side he lifted up his eyes turned his head and saw her and at that moment it was revealed to him that was his wife he came to the office later told I said are you sure he said yes I'm sure I gave him a book to read I told him read this book when you are done and you feel the same feeling then I'll tell you what next and the the rest is history they now married and is the pastor of the church and and this sister when it came to her job she didn't even have to hustle the way God did it was Supernatural to be able to go and be with ourand appointed time of God but the question is can we wait for the appointed time of our visitation and when that moment comes are we willing to receive that's how God works and before I I I I I bring it to a close I want us to go into our Bible in the Book of Luke we are going to read many verses from there and read on the side of zacharius and side of the birth of John and then I'll bring this to a close friends this is just so shocking moving I think is the right word but I would say it's the word of God it is is real it is real it is real there was in in the days we are beginning from verse 5 chapter one of Luke if you could please stand there with me and we read together there was in the days of hero the King of Judea a certain priest named Zacharias of the course of ABIA and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron and her name was Elizabeth and they were both righteous before God walking in all the Commandments and and ordinances of the Lord blameless and they had no child because that Elizabeth was Barren and they both were now well stricken in years and it came to pass that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his cause according to the custom of the priest's office his lot was to burn incense when he went into the Temple of the Lord and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of the incense and there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when Zacharias saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon them upon him but the angel said unto him fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear the a son and I shall call his name John now this is the Angel of the Lord speaking to to to Zacharias he said he said thou shall you will bear a son God has heard your prayer and your wife now will finally have a son and you shall call his name John and you shall have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine no strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb you can follow me if you're reading luganda just follow and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of of the fathers to the children are you listening and a disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord and Zacharia said unto the angel now you can interpret it when the angel came I know you're quiet but I know you listen and that's okay when the angel came at that moment he had he had not come to joke he had not come to waste time he didn't even have time to was because the the God that was going to bring forth the Messiah had already now come to full maturity and and and and and this zakariah he had the seed which was going to bring forth the man who would prepare the messiah's coming and Zariah had waited together with his wife elizabe they didn't have a baby so when the angel now came to Zarah he was not about to waste any moment and when he talked to Zechariah and zear instead of believing what did he say he said how shall I know this I am an old man and my wife is very old the angel was not happy when you time for your visitation come don't turn it down it Grieves the angel of the Lord and the angel answering said unto him what I believe this is what the angel felt said I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God and I am sent to speak unto the and to show you this glad Tiding and behold thou shall be dumb and and not be able to speak until the day these things shall be performed because thou believest not my words we shall be fulfilled in their season in their season in their season not in the season of Zarah Zariah said I'm old listen to me brothers and sisters it doesn't matter your situation when God is appointed time has come he will accomplish his words in his season not your season whether you feel like it or not he will fulfill it whether you accept it or not he will Hallelujah and the angel Gabriel was very angry for Gabriel to be angry you must have anger him Gabriel always brings good news he said I am Gabriel I stand in the presence of God and I've come to give you this good news and you're wasting my time there is a part they don't tell us but I'll tell to you before I continue reading that moment the angel struck Gabriel dumb couldn't talk anymore and that moment he left listen why did he do that because this man was an unbeliever he did oh my God he did he did not want God is word to be gossiped about by believer he wanted only the believer to talk about it listen brother if you believe the word God will open your mouth to speak and the Bible says forbid him not that speak amen because he has something to say but if you you don't believe the word you can't speak God will render you dumb and immediately he left Gabriel he left Zar and he went to the wife of he went to Elizabeth if you not believe me somebody El Believe Me In other words the angel said that unel what go will accomplish his word and if if zaras won't believe Elizabeth will Sur believe that part is not there but we'll know it how somehow later on because he immediately goes to uh you know the woman and tells the same same message and the woman must have beli I don't know what she did because the man was an unbeliever women are very wise the angel must have told the woman what to do for her to become pregnant because I believe it must not have been by the word because the word was only Christ John was a sinner like us are you following me so with with with Elizabeth Elizabeth it must have been physical involvement of a husband I believe it might have even been like how it was with Jacob and a mother you remember how it was oh he wants to give food es to give food go hunt and bring food my son you have to snatch the blessing put this thing on yourself go take this I will make it for you go bless I believe the angel Gabriel came to her and said this is what you have to do because this is the appointed time and the son will be called Jo and and and and and Elizabeth must have said amen I believe she went out of our way to believe it the Bible tells us later on listen as I read here praise the name of the Lord and when he came out he could not speak and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple he had seen a vision but he not believe the vision made him dumb brother believe the vision about your life sister believe the vision go wants you to walk and it came to pass that as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished he departed to his own house and now listen to these last words and after those days his wife Elizabeth con and he herself five months saying thus has the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me to take away my reproach among men and now later on on verse 59 I want and it came to pass that on the eighth day that they came to circumcise the child and they they called his name they called him zacharius after the name of his [Music] father this is how I'm able to know that the angel also went to marye and his mother answered and said no his name is not zakar was Elizabeth in the room when the angel was speaking to to Zacharias was she answer me church if you've been following was she she wasn't where did she get the news the angel must have gone her he said you will not call him Zar no he shall be called John Hallelujah am Elizabeth Elizabeth do I have an Elizabeth here and they said unto her no there's no one in your none of th Kindred that is called by this name and they made signs to his father [Music] what should we call your son and at that moment the Bible says told them give me a pen give me a pen and paper so I can write you couldn't talk they brought it brother don't suffer not accepting God's Vision believe the vision believe the vision when you believe the vision you will not suffer you will not suffer amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen from today don't be dumb don't be dumb open your mouth and talk declare even when we are here praying don't just be down are praying for you talk declare upon yourself the vision of the Lord for your life pray out loud glorify his name because you have a mouth that is open and a mother and finally he wrote joh which means he has now accepted the vision after much suffering and at that moment the Bible says his mouth was open immediately hallelujah hallelujah I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to accept the vision right now for your life if you accept it God will open your mouth you will begin to praise God you will begin to glorify God and he would say thank you for my husband thank you for my wife thank you for my blessing thank you for my job thank you for what you promise me thank you Lord for healing me thank you Lord for my blessing thank you for another level thank you Lord for my land thank you for my house thank you for delivering me Hallelujah can someone open their mouth and thank God if your vision has been accepted in your heart don't let the devil steal it from you hallelujah amen the Bible says and his tongue lose and he spoke and he praised God and fear upon all those that were in the house and it was noised abroad and it was noised [Music] abroad in that moment he had accepted it amen he became she became pregnant well of course she had already given back and at that moment the boy grew when both father and mother had accepted he was of the Lord and he was a prophet of God and he went before him in the power and the spirit of elah to turn the hearts of the fathers the elah before the first coming of Jesus Christ so much that when he Mary went and met Elizabeth this child was dead but when Elizabeth Mary Jesus in the womb of Mary gave life to John in the womb of Elizabeth and Elizabeth and and John was filled with the Holy SP in the womb of of his so what am I trying to say the appointed time come for the Messiah to come to the world but they had one to introduce him and that was John the Baptist John the Baptist had to be born I want to ask you a question what do you think of the Lord concerning your life certain things God May permitted for when she was pregnant when she was bared God was quiet until the time appointed then a baby came in her home what do you think of the Lord concerning your bar may we all stand now this is the moment you don't want to lose and when the angel of the Lord would move brother bham would preach and at the end of the meeting the angel of the Lord would show up and make good the things he had spoken you see this meeting right now the way we are right now has the potentials of that same thing happening I'd like all of us to be really consecrated now at this time because the angel of the Lord is going to show up I speak it with so much much confidence because he said it's the same yesterday [Music] to yes Sweet Holy Spirit your presence is here [Music] when your appointed time has arrived no one can stop it no demons no powers of hell no Wicked forces of sat no unbelief can hinder it someone here [Music] who has been captured by the spirits of unbelief because you do not believe the vision of God concerning your life and you ended up going into other things to satisfy that hunger in you but let me tell you I'm here today as the angel of concerning your life and the the angel spoke and said I am sent from the presence of God for I stand in the presence of God we are standing on Holy [Music] Ground and I'm standing here this afternoon on Holy Ground I stand in the presence of God and I've come to declare to you you do not have to live in your defeat anymore [Music] I'm here to declare to you now is the time of your for as many as we believe it you are going to walk into it you're going to begin to see
