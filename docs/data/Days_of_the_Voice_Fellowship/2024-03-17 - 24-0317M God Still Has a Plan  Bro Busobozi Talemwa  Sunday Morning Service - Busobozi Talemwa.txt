good at networking we are bringing in friends and family brothers and sisters from other churches and they supporting the cause you do the same in your group and don't discourage your team leader enourage your team leaders um and also I had there's another group uh that okay not have the names here but that also raised a good sum I think it is Paul and I was told that they also had many friends who helped them mystery is if you give what you can and then bring in your friends to support amen let's try this week then we see that there will be a lot of progress much more than we have already made but all the team leaders God bless you and all the contributors we sincerely appreciate your sacrifice is seeing the little you are giving it means much and and I tell you this wave will

a subject God still has a plan if you are spiritual you already know God is going to speak them God still has a plan God still has a plan all right turn to your left again and tell another one God still has a plan Hallelujah God still has a plan this morning praise the Lord God called Jonah God does not regret of his decisions that's a fact God does not regret of his decisions he always knows the end from the beginning he knew what Jonah's reactions and actions would be but he still called and said his confidence was in the seed that he had placed in Jon God knew me before I was even born he knew all the mistakes I would make in my life he knew my good and bad but he still called me so when we will see here when God calls he doesn't just call he calls on a certain basis God still had a plan for Jonah Jonah thought he could run he leaned upon his own understanding he went the opposite way him and S him to n but Jonah took the the Sheep to T but God still had a plan God is God a plan some of you are maybe not fulfilling the the purpose of God for your life yet you are not even in a place that God wants you to be but I have a message for you this morning God still has a plan for you God has a plan for me God has a plan for each and every one of us amen and nothing is going wrong praise the name of the Lord amen he is God somebody tell someone God is God God and he's God by himself amen he cannot share his glory with anyone God is God on the mountain God is God in the valley God is God in loss God is God when you have gain he's God when you are in sin he's God when you are in righteous he God when you are in weakness God when you are strong God when you are rich is God when you are poor God is God God is God all the time and the god that we know is a good god so this message I'm preaching about that God is God all the time and God has a plan for each and every one of us this morning you may say well I feel that I'm a sinner I feel I am worthy or I feel I do not have I can't I can't really be a Son of God I don't feel like the Rapture will come it has nothing to do with your feelings it doesn't have anything to do with the purpose of God the word of God and the promises of God is never about our feelings it has everything to do with his promises all things work together for good in the Book of Romans chter 8 verse 28 one time I was inis ABA and I read this scripture for sister yodit and if she wasn't if I wasn't who I was to her she would have slapped me because she was going through a very tough time and then I told her about sister the Bible says for all things work together for could you say that are you saying this is also for good amen and I'm smiling this morning because I believe that nothing is going wrong in each of Our Lives all works for good where is Sister Esther we thank God for preserving amen but all that was for good and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the C according to his purpose whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Breen over whom he did predestinate they he also called and whom he called they also Justified because he justified they also glorify now I want you to understand today we are called according to his purpose we are here on a mission his mission cannot fail it is not my mission it is his mission through me and in me and that mission cannot fa even when bad and wicked things touch my life even when bad and wicked things touch your life his will his will always you know he through his will he will take those things that have happened in your life he will bring it to be good and he will make it good for your life and for others around you in the life of the C nothing is going wrong am I preaching to someone here this morning am I preaching to someone here this morning will if God is speaking to you don't say well you spoke to me say amen God always had a plan Those whom he did for no he predestinated so when we say that God called you there is something I want you to see this morning when we said that God called you he didn't just go around in the market and he saw and he said this one looks good and he picked you among the rest that's not how God calls his calling is not that way his calling is far reaching it is far deeper than just going in a market and picking let me show you the procedure of God to call some after you have known your mind is going to open you're going to see God in everything that happens those who he for knew so it begins with forign knowledge he knew them before they came into existence he knew them before they were born he knew them before they were in their mother's room he knew before their father and mother married knew before they did good or bad those who he for he predestinated hallelujah amen un confirmation now those he for knew he predestinated to be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ so in other words predestination means pre pre is before and destination is the end so predestination predes means he knew what would happen to them in the end and what will happen in knew it would be confirmation to the image of his son all those for he predestinated them to be into the image of Jesus so if God for me he he predestinated me to be in the perfect image of Christ nothing can stop me no disease can stop me no unfortune can stop no bad woman can stop no sin can stop nothing that happened can stop nothing in my life can stop why because God forew me and he predestinated me to be conform to the image of Jesus Christ and those he predestinated hallelujah amen those he predestinated then he calls them Hallelujah so for God to call you he had to know you before after knowing you then he predestinated you after predestin then he called you God doesn't call anybody God doesn't call everybody if I'm called I was known and he predestinated me therefore I cannot be defeated everything in my life is working out for the good and those he called the Bible says he [Music] justif hallelujah amen he he knew amen there would be Sinners he knew they would not be perfect because he for them and he predestinated them so what did he do he called them he knew they're not perfect so he said you are Justified justification means you have been condemned it is true you are a sinner but justification means you have been rendered sinless now remember this is before you were even born it's not your action it is his work when you talk about salvation and Redemption we need to look to him not to us so when he justified you it is as though you have never seen in the first place and those justifi then he glorified he glorified he glorified the world no matter what the word brings your way or my way as long as this is the process I've gone through and I believe I'm the nothing can stop me to accompl my purpose Earth and friends this has been my strength in this life many people give up and they give up so fast because they don't know how God works many of them beat themselves because they have so many imperfections in people concentrate on things that are nothing to God people concentrate on their worries they concentrate on their insufficient people concentrate on their heartbreaks people concentrate on what people did to them and when God looks at you doing that then he is so surprised why you cannot understand is not about all those things it's about his love is about his for it's about those he call about his ability to justify to glorify God has glorified you no man can put you down God Has Lifted you up not demon not Spirit not wied force can bring you down nothing you can do to somebody somebody can do to you that will bring you down why because there is a greater power we are not alone there is a greater power that determines our Liv that determines our destiny and our Destin is clear it is fashioned in the hands of God he even said father all those you have given me they are mine and I will lose none of them Hallelujah am you need to understand it is not about you it is about him and he said they all in the pal my hand Oh Glory to God if you in the palm of the of God you cannot be lost you cannot go to hell you cannot be destroyed your soul is eternal just like God is eternal you are born to leave live eternally nothing happen can determine your destiny because God has already determined your from eternity you came from God go back to God Amen we need to understand this when you understand this you are going to stop being so defeated in your mind and many people don't actually overcome because they live in a life that is defeated a life that is sorry they can't even pray because of what I did they can't even do anything they can't even serve God I am nothing whenever God looks at you that what's WR with this understand understand that have called him that have predestinated him that have loved him that have Justified him glorified him it's not about him it's about me I have a plan it is not his plan it is my plan it is not your plan God his plan about your life I wanted to preach on something else but this morning these words came to me so strong in my I believe it is an inspiration which will bless someone no matter what you're going through in your life good or bad listen to me carefully Hallelujah now when God called somebody he says I'll be with you now one time God Called Moses and mes was so sorry he didn't want to go because of many reasons but God called him and God used him time came when Moses died and there was another one that God called his name was Joshua now Joshua was a person that believed in God but even when Moses died God still had a plan I want you to see you may dwell on blaming Moses for heting the The Rock and was wrong scripturally and all this was supposed to but all worked for good God had it in plan had it in mind I not going to justify any wrong doing but I want to justify this morning the plan and purpose of God for your life even in wrongdoing even in wrongdoing he uses them to glorify and lift his purpose in your life so we should not dwell on what has happened us ahead of us around us to defeat the purpose of God we should dwell on him that called us if God called me then he knew I am perfect he knew I'm the man for the he knew even the demons of Hell cannot defeat because I am not here on my own I am here on Earth on Divine assignment the devil can K me even my Divine assignment has been accomplished when John was born the devil wanted to kill him but no one could touch him until the assignment that God gave him was completed now God allowed them to kill I don't care how I die I don't you shouldn't care how we die whether is through an accident or through sickness or through pain and suffering it doesn't matter what matters is I cannot die until my assignment on Earth has been accomplished I do not live in fear of death each time because I know death can hear death can hear and when God speaks death can flee because death cannot stand before a child of finished his Divine ass Hallelujah I have a Divine ass I have souls to redeem I have souls to preach I have wherever God wanted me to go that's why I don't fear flying I don't fear driving long Journeys I don't fear walking long Journeys if I know God sent me somewhere I go anyhow because I know I am on Divine assignment same thing with you do not fear what man can do don't look at man don't look at what the devil can do look at your Divine assignment let me tell you some men who can walk so close to God God will reveal to you your divine assignment that is what we call purpose when men walk on this Earth without a sense of purpose without knowing their assignment on Earth they will always live defeated life but when you know your purpose you do not fear but those men women they go be wiing others because of fear they hate others because of fear they Envy others because of fear all those things are because of fear but when you know your Divine you do not fear what others are planning against you do not fear what the devil is dropping ising to drop you with you do not fear amen what may come or what may go you do not fear because you know amen you in the palm of the and you must accomplish a purpose if God speaks to you and he says like he spoke to Abraham leave this place and go to that place when you arrive at that when you start out your journey you have no fear about the night or the day or the darkness because you know you trust in him who called you he has a purpose and his purpose shall be accomplished the good work he has started in me will be accomplished and nothing can hinder and Moses died and then he came to Joshua and he said I'll be with you I want you to look at Joshua 1 ver4 you could open that in the in vers vers four from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river ephes all the land of the he titites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your cost [Music] friends I wanted to hear me clearly open your spiritual ears sit on the edge of your seat this morning except do to feel tired because I'm about to give you utterances through the word of God which will make you see your future clear I want you to see this when God came down to he spoke to him and he said you know from this Great River to the Sea will be your cost now today um the the Palestinians they even have a chant they usually chant when they are you know mobilizing people to come and fight against Israel that free Palestine from the river to the sea free Palestine because according to them and that's why it is not possible to solve the Israel Palestine question by politics this is a Divine thing you know God gave to Israel the son the son the children of Isaac through Ibraham he gave them we see it done here in the Book of Joshua from The River To The Sea he said that is your C that is your portion that is your land now Palestine also says that is all our land and so each of the cannot be satisfied with a portion and Israel cannot also be satisfied with a portion they want it all but I'm not going to speak about it politically I'm going to speak the scripture God gave it to Israel it is their promise that's why at this current time you notice God has given those men a resolve presid uh prime minister netan you know he said no matter what America or anybody says we went into this we are going to win the war and we are going to wipe her Mas and we are going to to restore piece or whatever it is but you see these people are behind prophecy you know if God promised it to isra it is for Israel even if the whole of Africa all of Europe all of Americans come against Israel Israel cannot be defeated because it is th sayth the Lord are you hearing me now in the same way we are the spiritual isra God has given us our C Hallelujah he has given us our C no man can dare take an inch whatever is mine is mine and the devil cannot take it from God has promised me healing is mine has Pro me Prosperity or a good life that is mine if God promises me marriage then marriage is mine are you hearing me if God promised me children then children are what did God promise you you can put on your lips now there are many things that have happened in your life that will look as though the promise will not come to pass but let me tell you because we drawn by God that boundary is drawn by hallelujah amen how much of it can you attain it depends on how much you want how much will you receive depends on how much you want he say every footstep is possession if you stay in one place you will get that little place I don't want to stay in one place I want to keep marching to every promise of God because every footstep his possession his possession I am possessing every ground that God has promised that God has given to me the devil cannot hinder me because I am on Divine do you receive the revelation of it I am on Divine assignment hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and so he said there shall not any man any man my God say any there shall not any man be able to stand before you all the days of your life said everything Israel in the natural we are so whatever God told them God tells us oh my my my Hallelujah my sister say there shall not be man able to stand before you all the days of your life I take that for myself take that for myself no man shall stand before me all the days of my life amen not a wish doctor he will not stand before me what does it mean everyone will be below you let me tell you oh my we have divine assignment it means we control Powers there are some people in this world who know themselves that they are the ones who control Nations some of them in America they call them Illumina and they say some theories they say that those illumin are the one who control America they deter who becomes president and things like that and and and in every nation there are those kind of people some of them are called King makers people bow to them respect that one is is the biggest let me tell you we are a royal priesthood we are higher than any rest we are the super I'm not it's a promise of the world the B calls us a super even now we can exercise our power we are the super we are the super people we are royal priesthood we are Kings and Priests so in other words when he says no man shall stand before you when it comes to Israel even if America being a superow the war in Israel they cannot defeat Israel do you know how Theon would be against isra all the world will be against is and it will be the third world war but do you know how it ends God himself Hallelujah God himself comes down and he the one who finishes the because the Bible says you know as he was coming down Amen on our horse amen they all came down to you know to kill him to shoot him down with nuclear powers and things but what does he do the Bible says a sword went out of his mouth and destroyed all of them and that is how the armagon will end and it will bring into the world a new civilization and that new civilization will be at a time called the Millennium the Bride of Jesus Christ with Christ being King us being Queen will rule on this Earth for of 1,000 years hallelujah amen if God cannot allow them to destroy his how much more us hallelujah amen how much more a blood Son of God I feel I'm on a Divine assignment many demons will try they don't know what they dealing with they don't know what they dealing with there shall not be any man be able to stand before you the of your life as I was with Moses so will I be with you I will not fail you I will not forsake you oh let me prophesy that upon my life you can do the same thing upon your life I will not fail you I will not forsake you will be with you that is what he has say to me he's saying it the same to you he will not fail you he not forsake you he will be with you th say the Lord cannot fail glory to God and he says be strong and of good courage For unto these people sht thou divide for an inher the land which I swe unto their father only be thou strong and of good and very courageous and that thou mayest observe to do according to the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from me to the right or the that

Angel and eat it and eat it and we love the book the book is a revelation of the word and we are enjoying the hallelujah hallelujah he says it will not depart from You observe everything that is written there for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous it comes in Obedience of the word not in doing some deals and things that is short short than not no sustainability and then thou sh have good success that's a prophecy to us Church you will prosper and have good success we often see when people are starting to get married and many people I mean I know they be wondering you know how can a young person get married when he doesn't even you know ear you know 5 million how can he live in this world you need to understand that we do not live in this economy As Long as You Follow the principles of the world what people what you are seeing is not what people are seeing and I remember when I got married myself actually my mother did not agree with me in the beginning because I had actually to drop out of school to get married I do not say you should do that that was my faith God should lead you in what you do and as long as it is God it doesn't matter do it he will be because you see we have promises here and later on my mother supported me because then she saw it was God if what you're doing is of the Lord God will back you each moment will fight for you each moment and he says have not I commanded thee be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dis and I don't know why I keep going back to marriage many people fre marriage because they dismayed they are afraid and I I see many of these you know older people telling them oh you are fear don't don't go into those things many of those I'm sorry to say I fail and they're telling you their fears and failures so you should know who you are hearing from and getting advice from get advice from the word of God what is the will of God for your when you do what God tells you God will always bring it to pass be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismay for the Lord your God is with you Hallelujah for the Lord your God with youever th with God there is no uncertainity you know in the message the uncertain sound he says listen certainly I'll be with you nothing uncertain about that as I was with Moses I'll be with you I'll be with you there is nothing uncertain about [Music] that I will be with you do we believe God now when he says I'll be with you he will do it he does not fail all the years have walked with God I will tell you for sure he has never failed not I failed him many times but he has never fa because he had confidence in the seed of God in Me he told Joshua years later as I was with Moses so will I be with you how am I going to take those great world cities that is not for you to figure out I was with Moses I'll be with you and everywhere and everywhere your foot traits is your possession just keep walking keep walking amen keep walking Hallelujah nothing is going to stand before you all the days of your life nothing uncertain about I will be with you trust God brother Ivan let this be a r word for you brother I no how difficult it has been for you but he's saying to you this morning I will be with you just keep walk keep walk he knows your life more than you know it your failures and your fears but keep walking the problem people don't keep walking when they slide a bit they give up and then God gives up because Jonah was in the will of God let us look this quot in the messenger greater than Solomon is here now look at Jonah many people think that Jonah was a terrible person Jonah was a prophet of the Lord walking in all the will of the Lord you say why did he not do what he did why did he do what he did he never done anything contrary to God's will you know God told Jonah go n he and the prophet is saying Jonah was in the will of God you say why did he do what he did he never did anything contr to God's way you can't if you are in Christ you cannot do anything contrary if you're walking humbly it may seem like you do but you don't do it nothing happens providential the footsteps of a righteous man is ordered of the LA and all things work together for the good to them that love him how can you take those scriptures and compare them with any other and then break them the scriptures cannot be broken nothing going wrong in my life think about your life as long as you the the Lord of course are you called of the Lord right everybody nothing going wrong everything is going in the perfect way of God or you say he took a sheep and went to touch it instead of n when God sent him to Neve and want to tou let's just look at it a few minutes find out it's the way you look at it it's the way you look at it you run over the top of them and say oh you are a I would like to be one i' like to be a j suddenly he was a man of God what is the prophet saying that Jonah was a man of God and he says he would like to be a Jonah why because Jonah was walking in the perfect will of why Jonah was assigned learn something here today in the of the sign of this time many people condemn Jonah I do not condemn you know they say well he's a j you you've you've had that expression but you must not do that Christians you shouldn't condemn God's servants I remember when I I first believe this message I was a very hot head I you know I I I of course I believe in Holiness and righteousness so when I see someone doing something I quickly go to them and I condemn them bring them down and I write emails I do this that one time there was a pastor and his name is um the late Pastor Bas and I was about 17 at the time so I heard that he had done something wrong in some of the things he told or whatever some minister told me that oh I became you know so angry I quickly wrote him an email after I called him I got his number and I called him and I I began rebuking him you are wrong you wrong must repent El and uh he he he he was very humble he listened to me he said what is your name I told him I am and then he said how old are you I think he had he had my sound I said where do you live I said he said can I visit you I said is it okay so can talk it over I said it's all right and so he he drove his car that was ding a Land Cruiser very nice car and he drove toana I was living in one little small room and when he came and I saw him and the guy was coming out I almost hid myself but he was so gracious he came in the house and he sat down and and you know he was very lovely I didn't even talk about those things again I did not talk about it again and he was very good and he said you can even come and visit us you're a preacher said yes so I called my P I told let me tell you friends from that day I made up my mind to respect all servants so when you see some of us do things in a certain way because you have gone through a school of experience and I have learned also other things have happened that I've learned to never be judgmental you hear words over the do you know you are going to be the devil's did you hear that is calling himself a lot of money they talked and talked were the things true yes but these people were misguided they did not know that Jonah was a prophet of God and Jonah was still working in the will of God one thing that I know friends the will of God will never take you to a place where his grace will not protect you amen sometimes the will of God will take you into pres you never want anyone to go but as long as you're walking in the word of God and you're working in his will for your life in Good Times in bad he is still God hallelujah and here he says Jonah was I do not condemn Jonah you know they say where is the Jonah you've heard that expression but he must not do that Christians you shouldn't condemn God's people Jonah was a prophet he was not out of the will of God he did just exactly he must do for for a sign everything happens not by Just [Music] Happening open your spiritual ear listen to what I'm saying this morning everything happens not by Just Happening it happens for a one time a prophet had to marry a prostitute have children by her one laid on his side for 340 days then turned over on the other side one stripped his cloes and just everything did for signs God is God and God does what he wants to do God doesn't answer to no man and Jonah had to do it for a son remember Abraham had to marry against his own will when sah give the handmade but he refused it but God appeared to him and he said listen to because the free woman will not be with a B woman she had to have a child she had to had she had to have the child be cast out what was it a sign all of it is signs God does those things for sign and Jonah was a sign now if you notice Jesus refers to eat here a weak and a wicked and a dous generation will seek after a sign that they will get it for as the prophet Jonah was in the belly of the well for three days and for three days and three nights what was Jonah then a sign of he was a sign of the Resurrection hallelujah amen hallelujah am J had to disobey when God called him he knew he was going to disobey and he knew it would work for God because he wanted it to be for a sign and then he called him and the man went to touch him and in the middle of the way the boat you know gets a lot of winds and people began to throw their they didn't want to drown and then they found Jonah sleeping [Music] brother we are praying you are doing now the brothers who do in the church feel comfortable even even those in churches assigned don't divert my sermons and why the brother was do they work say brother he said me I'm going for what I know what I did the man knew what and it was God's will you know the bad things that have happened in your life things that you're not proud of this morning I will tell you God permitted it to [Applause] happen because if you are a called of God if you were the called of God you have been called for a purpose and if Jonah wanted wouldn't stop himself from going to that ship to tarish because God knew God knew that he would goish and then he knew that they would throw him into where did that fish come from think about it do we still have them today that can swallow human beings do we and a human being can live life in there three days three nights do we have such that fish was created just for that moment so God was in this and when the man went into that he started praying oh God days let me ask you as he was in the deepest H days it was a sign of the coming of the Messiah when the Messiah comes you be in the deepest days and night and when he came he resurrected and Jonah was a sign when they asked Jesus for a sign gave the sign of prophet Jon Hallelujah are you following me verse 15 of Jonah 1 so they took up Jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the seed from her raging then the man feared the Lord exceedingly and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord and made vows now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah right there God prepared it imagine God preparing your and Jonah was now in the belly of the fish three days and three nights theil thought he had won but God still had a plan in the middle of the bell of the great fish was still God and he still had a plan it was not over until God said it was and I want to speak to some of you here today praise the name of the Lord you know you may also be in the middle of your fish now some of you may be in the middle of your fish I want to say God is still God still has a plan it is not over until he says it is over he's the director of this movie not over until he says never accept defeat friend even when they laugh at you don't you worry because God is in this and God still a plan praise the name of the Lord and as Jonah was right there in that deepest of the sea Jonah prayed unto the Lord and out of the fish's belly he cried because of his Affliction unto the Lord and the Bible says he was he said for thou has cast me into the deep in the midst of the Seas and they and the floods Compass me about Billows and th waves pass over me then I said I am cast out of th side I will look again Temple no matter what situation you go through in your life always look to the Lord the waters Compass me about even to the soul the depth closed around about me the weeds were wrapped about my head I went down to the bottoms of the mountains the Earth with her BS was about me forever yet hast thou brought up my life from the corruption oh Lord my God when my soul fainted within me I remember the Lord and my prayer came in unto the th Holy Temple now imagine if Jonah had decided to shut up and not pray and many of us when we are going through trials and situations we never pray many of us say I don't even feel like praying I don't feel like praying why why did God allow it I come in this situation listen I want you to understand today that God still has a plan and all things work together for the good those are called of God and and and Jonah prayed and Jonah prayed and we can pray like M prayed as well says therefore will I look unto the Lord I will wait for the god of my salvation my God will hear me Rejoice not against me or my enemy when I fall I shall AR when I sit in darkness the Lord shall be a light me I will bear the indignation of the Lord because I have sinned against him until he plead my CA and ex judgment for me he will bring me forth to the light and I Shall Behold his righteousness then she I always love this part then she that was my enemy shall see it let me pause there right a moment listen do you know your enemies play a very big role in your life how many knew that your enemies are very important that's why the says you should love them if someone threatens you or intimidates you that person is very important in your life love them because they there to to fulfill a purpose in your life let me prove that imagine God has blessed you everything you want in life but you alone in the world will you enjoy it sincerely even if you have a very good suit you won't enjoy it because no one will see it let's be realistic I'm dressed this way and I know you are seeing me and I'm happy because you because if I was in my bedroom I was not dress like this is that not true even you think it's only even you you address that way because we are seeing you and so you enjoy things when others are watching God knows that and that's why he also say I will prepare a table for you but it will have to be in the presence of your enemies because God wants it for you to love your enemies so that they can see when God lifts you your enemies will see and they will say m God Has Lifted him so love your enemies they are there for a purpose if someone never said you will never marry how would you be so happy when you're getting if someone said you will never give birth and you become pregnant even when you praying give me this pregnan so that my enemies will know I have a living God that's the prayer and then you remember even when when Moses was in the desert God was very angry with the isites he wanted to kill all of them he told Moses move K why did Moses pray oh please God don't kill them because those enemies of our they will see what and they will say they God not deliver them not fulfill his promise so leave the people for the sake of our enemies sometimes God protects you because of your enemies so your enemies are very very and that's why you should love them let God ha them by proving to them with your with blessing there are many scriptures about that there many scriptures about that how God can only bless you lift you to show your enemies the enemies play a very big role if you are if you are hting your enemies you are spending your energy bad love your enemies and sometimes it's not because you Hur them sometimes because they don't love you or like you have you ever there when you are just hated by someone for no reason someone doesn't just like you no matter what you do they just don't like you you can't change it so I'll tell you what you should do says love them by so doing putting CES of fire on their but when you fear someone to the extent that you can't even greet them when you see them you are smiling just change she has come she has I don't like that person then you are greeting God will make sure that those enemies of yours will love you and it is a very bad thing for your enemies to love you because God will LIF them in now the Bible here says when this man was praying then he that was my enemy shall see it and shame shall cover her said unto me where is the Lord thy God my eyes Shall Behold her now shall she be thren down of the streets oh my God may God give us more enemies so that he will lift us more and more the more enemies you have the more things God will do for you to prove your enemies wrong but love your enemies praise the name of the Lord so if you are seated in darkness I want to tell you today God still has a plan if you have sinned God still has a plan Hallelujah if your heart broken God still has a plan if you are discouraged this morning someone God still has a plan Hallelujah if you're confused about something in your life God still has a plan maybe you are stranded stranded know someone who get stranded God still has when God begins to Fashion your life there's one thing that God does he makes your life a mystery to your enemies so they your enemies who actually fear things they don't actually know to the extent they can even dream one time there was a man called Gideon and he was going to fight his enemy and when one brother went in the camp of his enemies he had over overheard one saying to how he dreamed coming down with a great mighty sword and Army and everybody was in fear you remember Jero how that woman you know told the spies everybody in Jero is shaken because they fear the god of Israel they know the god of Israel J Let Me Tell the kind of God I want whereby I will love my enemies but my enemies will be shaken because of my God I always know in my life no matter what happens no matter what happens God still has and as I'm finishing just right now the Holy Spirit dropped in something to in my heart for the Believers in the north of Ethiopia and and and B and others you know they've had War there and many people have died many people have died literally brother told me that there was um he Nally survived you know he had gone to to the office and they began shooting and you know and and the bullets just passed him and it was a very devastating thing and and his sons brother Jonathan listening in and brother they were supposed to go and join the Army and of course they would have died but God did not permit it and but many in that region have died many friends and relatives and so I have a word for them God still has a plan for that and I remember one time when I was were just still in the other small place um I just came on the pulpit just like now I was feeling like I'm feeling now I don't know how many were there at that time at that time God had laid aasa on my hand I said I don't know about what it will be but I feel God has a plan for our there is going to be a work in our there will be a church in our took a trip there in one visit during 30 people were baptized that had never happened before in and the church is still there and many are coming up in that area under the ministry of our brother Ephraim and so I I just feel to say even for the region of Northern Ethiopia I'm not a prophet don't make but it's a prophetic word praise the name of the Lord God is going to raise a great work in that Reg in that whole region of let me tell you God is going to use many people there to take this message and spread it all over and wherever this message goes Prosperity follows have you watched it in your life that's
