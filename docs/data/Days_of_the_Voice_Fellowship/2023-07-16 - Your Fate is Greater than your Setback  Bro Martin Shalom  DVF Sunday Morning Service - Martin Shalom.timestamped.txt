[1:14:01] is
[1:14:05] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:14:08] many brethrens
[1:14:13] moreover whom he did predestinate
[1:14:17] then he also called and whom he called

[1:14:53] there are people whom God for our soul
[1:14:58] he predestinated them he worked on their
[1:15:02] issues

[1:15:14] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:15:17] God which is in Christ
[1:15:21] blessed be the name of the Lord the word
[1:15:25] for knowledge is

[1:39:23] message

[1:40:03] because you don't know what kind of seed
[1:40:05] you are dealing with him
[1:40:09] hmm
[1:40:11] it is like preaching to pharaohs
[1:40:14] after God had in his heart
[1:40:18] what did you expect to receive from him
[1:40:23] God told Moses
[1:40:30] for your sake
[1:40:32] God can destroy the holy nation
[1:40:38] God can finish the holy Village
[1:40:42] amen for his child is
[1:40:48] God can do anything Amina
[1:40:53] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:40:58] sometimes people rise against you
[1:41:02] just when you're innocent
[1:41:05] and they fight against you but they just
[1:41:09] watch them
[1:41:11] I remember when I got uh when I got an
[1:41:13] accident
[1:41:15] there's a man who was on my neck
[1:41:18] he came to the hospital
[1:41:20] we are taking the patience happens
[1:41:34] to pick the second number please
[1:41:37] that was the behind one so they found
[1:41:40] him struggling with it then they ask him
[1:41:43] what are you doing I see this guy's uh
[1:41:47] this man has knocked something
[1:41:50] and they asked him
[1:41:53] where is your point of
[1:41:55] concerned the patients
[1:42:03] then where's your problem
[1:42:20] and then it was called and he was asked
[1:42:25] how I took the number place
[1:42:34] that was not answering the questions
[1:42:40] but for me in there I had no time to
[1:42:43] fight with him
[1:42:44] I had people who could help me with him
[1:42:49] but if we can fight our battles
[1:42:52] God does not fight for us
[1:42:57] so I Shield I rested my case

[1:43:04] at the scene
[1:43:07] he came without with uh license
[1:43:21] I don't need to move to prove to him
[1:43:24] that I have a license
[1:43:27] at least I made it in my soul that I
[1:43:29] will never drive somebody's car without
[1:43:32] having a license
[1:43:35] [Music]
[1:43:45] [Music]
[1:44:00] Egypt upside down because of his
[1:44:03] children

[1:45:04] every day they call you
[1:45:07] you better go without you you rather go
[1:45:09] without food but satisfying them
[1:45:15] blessed with the name of the Lord those
[1:45:18] were set back
[1:45:21] but my faith is still great
[1:45:27] few months down the road
[1:45:30] one morning I was going walk
[1:45:33] then there is
[1:45:44] foreign
[1:46:15] amen man
[1:46:17] he even told somebody hey that man one
[1:46:19] day almost knocked me I've never even
[1:46:21] met him on the road
[1:46:24] so I knew this is the devil
[1:46:27] but I said God I will not fight my
[1:46:30] battles
[1:46:32] but when time for paying back him
[1:46:36] it was so bad
[1:46:40] he bought a car yeah he's a driver he's
[1:46:43] driving someone who works with the u.nz
[1:46:46] so he thought that that when a goat
[1:46:49] sleeps in a crowd it becomes a cough
[1:46:57] he thought is his yes
[1:47:07] it is the masses of the Lord
[1:47:12] Brethren God even take care of us
[1:47:23] then one day was going to travel
[1:47:26] and uh oh okay

[1:48:15] and he told me I don't know whether
[1:48:17] three or four people died
[1:48:21] or whatever
