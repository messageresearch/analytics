and penetration [Music] and I wrote these words by inspiration but before I read them for you I want to read a line out of what brother Isaac preached he said you are the people going to God is going to use to fire Kampala again Uganda that's not a maybe that's the truth we are not clearly we are not all the youth in Uganda right Uganda but there are many more years and so that's what they say then the other line is if you replace this kind of church so what do you get a religion is if you replace shouting and uh which foreign I don't even know the title of the sermon he preached but that's what the Holy Spirit minister to me as he was speaking but before that these words came to me and if it came from the Lord it has something where it is I don't care about the criticism here maybe those who are streaming um foreign brother I called for you because I know you would interpret this perfectly yeah [Music] that feel a call of God on their life into Ministry these words were before brother Isaac said that he is responsible to the Holy Spirit and he demonstrated how a man is called into Ministry the Holy Spirit already said this through the preaching he's been teaching the young people how you according to the Ministries call the young men that feel a call of God on their life into Ministry those that will be a generation of men that will be that will that will I don't even know the handwriting I wrote it but I can't even reading I have to understand this word you know those that will be a generation of men that will will have back a backbone and to demonstrate this message call them to come forward and take a stand those are the words I wrote yeah and that's what I'm going to do now the rest of you Allah at this moment I've just maybe you can close your eyes and we are going to sing that song in a moment but while we sing this song these have been wonderful meetings and each service has impacted Our Lives maybe to some of you young men that the devil has shown the world and all the glamorous but here is an opportunity for you to come and take a stand if you feel the call of God upon you mean your life for for Ministry [Music] for propagating this message say I have heard this message [Music] [Music] calls ministers [Music] it's not even the chat that sends out ministers it's God who calls is the Holy Spirit what am I talking about I'm talking

[Music] of yourself thank you foreign [Music] [Music] it was able to help us get started a lot of things because of time yeah [Music] from what I see since we've had we've [Music] from what I have is foreign [Music] [Music] and um we took Pleasures in our church [Music] we've collected about 2.2 million sentences [Music] of this morning I believe and there were some places from our church [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] so I just said all that to say God has almost taken care of of God has almost taken care of everything [Applause] yes [Applause] yes and so uh I have I see here at deficit of about four millions and that is of course the Brethren from Kenya oh ah okay I don't know whether you wanted me to do that sorry I've already done it but I said don't do it that is that is not a Kenya million Shillings yes four million Shillings in Kenya is how much percentage 120 million Uganda Shillings for the Brethren is streaming from Kenya please this is not Kenyan shillings so this is Uganda shooting there's no sense Uganda I think it's a little over a thousand dollars or something like that yes and we we have we have our brothers visiting and listen I believe we should take care of them also so the fans that I'm telling you is not what is taking care of them it is the funds that we needed to take care of ourselves I think I saw a list of I'll give this the afternoons after the afternoon service I don't I want to spare the details so we can go for lunch and then come back as of yesterday father two churches represented and about five pastors have been around so this has been to take care of us this has the fans I've spoken was about taking care of us sentences um but we we are taking we're going to take up an offering and this will help us it will help us cover that money because Pastor you have big Faith you mean we are going to collect four Millions right now yes it is I know some of you have paid company but like I told you that we we had to do that to make sure we we have something to support otherwise what we wanted you to come we didn't want it to be a hindrance help us cover that money because we want something extra yeah we do that maybe in the last service of the last service so we're going to take an offering this morning to help on this together we shall go towards our visitors to help them on their expenses by the way this is the right way too he ain't calling into Fair dealing with money is you pass the collection plate will you make the need known you make the need known you pass the collection place then you this one person is robbing the blessings of all the others some things should change we are not going to call brothers from Canada and ask them to fight to give us food to eat together foreign why raunchy because I believe it should be that way we should learn to own our meetings [Music] if we call a meeting we should give ourselves [Music] and I know that in Uganda here many times we want to associate white skin with money Uganda is but many he can confirm that many in his country live on on loans houses cars and everything they really don't own them some of you have funds of three millions in Africa we are not only we are not really poor us to change our mind we pass a collection plate you give 500 Shillings no way you lose return you you you go out to buy a phone you spend 2 million no way your medium that is hypocrisy we should change that attitude I think if I was to preach in these meetings I would have preached on money but you have survived because I will not preacher so we are going where are the deacons we are going to take up an offering give abundantly and God will bless you abundantly those streaming you can you might as well go and give online as well you can find that
