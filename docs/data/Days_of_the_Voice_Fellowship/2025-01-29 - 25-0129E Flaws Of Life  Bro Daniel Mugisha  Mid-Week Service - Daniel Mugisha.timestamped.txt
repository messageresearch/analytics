[46:04] straight to the
[46:06] word in John 9 verse
[46:15] 1-4 let us
[46:18] read and as Jesus passed by he saw a man
[46:22] which was blind from his
[46:25] birth and his deciples asked him
[46:29] saying this man or his parents that he
[46:33] was born blind Jesus answered neither
[46:38] has this man sinned nor his parents but
[46:43] that but but that the works of God
[46:46] should be manifested in him amen I must
[46:50] work the works of him that sent me while
[46:53] it is day the night cometh when no man
[46:57] can
[46:58] work Hallelujah
[47:30] [Music]
[47:50] amen you can have your
[47:54] seats uh today I have some
[47:59] sensitive uh title that I want to talk
[48:02] about and
[48:06] someon because even when I was
[48:10] studying it was so hard for
[48:14] me I was feeling a lot of
[48:18] fear because of what I was
[48:22] reading so I I hope we are going to be
[48:24] blessed
[48:28] Hallelujah so my my my topic
[48:32] today it will be flaws of
[48:35] Life flows of
[48:38] life no flows are
[48:43] like like
[48:45] [Music]
[48:50] weaknesses many of us not even many of
[48:53] us all of us
[48:56] have Flows In Our
[48:58] Lives all of us have Flows In Our
[49:03] Lives
[49:05] weaknesses we have imperfections in
[49:08] us we have faults in
[49:10] us that we also don't
[49:13] desire that's how God created
[49:16] us hallelujah hallelujah because he had
[49:19] a
[49:20] reason to why we are born like that why
[49:24] that is happening
[49:27] and he knows
[49:29] why you may ask yourself why what did I
[49:33] do to
[49:34] God like this the disciples were asking
[49:37] Jesus why did did this man
[49:40] sin did the par
[49:43] sin why is he born
[49:46] blind some crooked have like maybe have
[49:50] one leg short or one leg
[49:53] tall some are
[49:58] very many people are born with weird
[50:02] things but the Bible is telling us that
[50:06] is all for the glory of
[50:08] God hallelujah hallelujah everything
[50:11] that happens to
[50:13] us it is for the glory of
[50:15] God and to to uh as in Romans chter 8
[50:20] verse
[50:22] 28 it says we and we know that all
[50:25] things happen together for good to them
[50:27] that love
[50:30] God to them who are called according to
[50:32] his
[50:34] purpose Hallelujah so God has placed
[50:37] flows in your
[50:39] lives to glorify his
[50:42] name sometimes you you isolate yourself
[50:46] from
[50:47] people because of the flaws you have in
[50:50] life because people have mocked you some
[50:54] have mocked from childhood
[50:59] because of what they were they didn't
[51:01] decide about it but they were born like
[51:05] that some things we adopt them in
[51:08] life the flaws of Life some we adopt
[51:11] them because of the situations all the
[51:13] families we are born
[51:16] in some are born in broken
[51:20] families why their parents are always
[51:23] quing and the child grows up hating
[51:26] marriage like
[51:28] nothing because he had no good example
[51:31] from
[51:32] me that is also FL his
[51:35] life some are born in poor
[51:38] families all those are
[51:42] flaws some are born uh and their parents
[51:46] just uh they they tell them stories that
[51:48] hey we found you on the the garbage Gage
[51:56] no the ones that adopted
[51:59] them that will found you
[52:02] here some grow up without knowing their
[52:05] parents they squee my
[52:08] dad you don't they don't
[52:11] know and those things follow
[52:14] us those things hinder
[52:18] us some of us like maybe some uh some
[52:23] people cannot speak maybe in public
[52:27] because maybe of how they grew up how
[52:31] maybe they cannot speak
[52:35] well maybe they're not
[52:37] learned they fear speaking
[52:40] people they fear people are going to
[52:42] laugh at
[52:44] my and they hinder them in
[52:47] life some
[52:50] others are born with dark
[52:54] skins and people they most people know
[52:56] that people like brown
[53:00] people and it becomes a
[53:03] flow and feel as if you're not
[53:07] worthy some very I can talk about very
[53:11] [Music]
[53:13] many
[53:14] amen but we know God uses every
[53:21] flow don't accept to be behind your
[53:24] flaws and hinder you to do what you're
[53:26] supposed to
[53:29] do because God has a work for
[53:32] you Hallelujah in whatever situation
[53:36] you're in or in whatever flow you in you
[53:39] have God knew all of
[53:45] it God knew
[53:48] everything something what did I do to
[53:50] God to become poor like
[53:52] this what did I do to God for my parents
[53:55] not to have
[53:58] school but God has a reason to why it is
[54:02] happen you just have to trust God and
[54:05] you'll see him moving in your
[54:08] life use your flow to glorify the name
[54:11] of
[54:15] God there's a lady I was reading

[55:00] but but when you reading the
[55:03] history when you read about her life
[55:06] now and you see how she
[55:09] glorified you'll wonder she was
[55:13] blind she she is
[55:17] recognized of

[55:22] hymns we have already sung this song
[55:25] some of you you been singing her songs

[55:45] Assurance very many songs that we have
[55:47] been

[56:01] and she said that God created me like
[56:05] this created me I can't do
[56:08] this it is up to
[56:11] him he has written songs that have

[58:44] other who was on the
[58:46] cross he would not be saved and would
[58:49] not about him right now

[59:21] Mike isn't that
[59:23] wonderful he loved you he loved you
[59:27] before there was a

[59:37] he knew all about
[59:38] you what what what you you was you are
[59:42] going to
[59:43] be and
[59:46] then and then what you are going to be
[59:48] and
[59:50] then M when he looked all over the great
[59:55] universe
[59:58] as it was he
[1:00:00] said I chose you Hallelujah and when he
[1:00:04] did that before there was a
[1:00:08] spark of
[1:00:10] light then you you you are internal with
[1:00:15] God when you receive the Holy Spirit the
[1:00:18] Holy Ghost then you become
[1:00:21] internal because you are with God you
[1:00:24] are a part of God can you see what I
[1:00:27] mean you are etal as God
[1:00:30] is you because he chose you with all
[1:00:35] your flaws he chose
[1:00:38] you with all your
[1:00:40] weaknesses that you may think will let
[1:00:42] you down that think that will not
[1:01:00] no one has an account of
[1:01:03] you no one has account of
[1:01:07] you only
[1:01:09] God someone may love at you
[1:01:12] today and tomorrow you're the going to
[1:01:14] help
[1:01:17] them someone may help you
[1:01:19] today and them more tomorrow
[1:01:26] because they see you in
[1:01:28] need but they don't know even what God
[1:01:30] has for you they don't know your
[1:01:33] tomorrow hallelujah amen many have sat
[1:01:36] on your
[1:01:38] floors and have made you a poor
[1:01:41] Christian and I made you give a wrong
[1:01:44] testimony about your
[1:01:50] God many have fallen very many
[1:01:53] times and I've said I cannot
[1:02:00] why do you get the guts of saying you
[1:02:01] cannot be
[1:02:05] Sav hallelujah amen we see
[1:02:09] Samson he had his own flows in
[1:02:12] life brother says all the prophets had
[1:02:17] flows in life all the people you read
[1:02:24] about all had flows in
[1:02:27] life but what did they do with
[1:02:30] them what did Samson do just for once
[1:02:36] small and was granted to
[1:02:39] him you may be at the end point at the
[1:02:41] end of the
[1:02:43] road saying my Christianity is now
[1:02:46] gone but there's a one
[1:02:50] smallen you may think that God maybe I
[1:02:55] may not go back
[1:02:58] school but there's
[1:03:00] God you may think that I don't have what
[1:03:02] to eat in the
[1:03:04] morning but there God who knew the
[1:03:09] Widow and imagine
[1:03:12] this Elijah when he came to the Widow he
[1:03:15] said you give me bread and eat I
[1:03:20] can I'm going with my baby and die
[1:03:27] but she used her flow
[1:03:30] and and God to give her and
[1:03:35] multip use your flow to serve God use
[1:03:39] your FL to glorify
[1:03:41] God see how he's going to pay
[1:03:43] you because brother says there's no
[1:03:47] service to do to
[1:03:48] God that shall not be
[1:03:51] paid Amina serve God with all your life
[1:03:56] and you'll see how he's going to
[1:03:58] bless
[1:04:00] am don't look on your
[1:04:04] weaknesses many people have not lived
[1:04:06] their life that God has prepared for
[1:04:09] [Music]
[1:04:11] them because of focusing on their
[1:04:16] flaws focusing on minor
[1:04:19] things and leaving out the
[1:04:23] major all opportunities
[1:04:26] they do not come
[1:04:29] easily being a great person in
[1:04:32] life there's a
[1:04:34] joury but people just want to fly and
[1:04:38] go and they skip the
[1:04:41] process is that FL that can make
[1:04:44] whatever you want to be in
[1:04:47] life you may say I don't know English I
[1:04:51] cannot H I don't I don't have a good
[1:04:53] voice I cannot sing
[1:04:56] H my my family is not even known in
[1:05:01] church so they cannot even allow me to
[1:05:08] minister don't let your flow overrule
[1:05:13] you Hallelujah because we have a God
[1:05:16] that
[1:05:18] cares he knew us he chose us he chose me
[1:05:23] and you
[1:05:26] he chose all the men that you admire the
[1:05:28] Bible he chose all the women you admire
[1:05:31] the Bible sometimes you look at Ruth in
[1:05:33] the Bible you said Lord I want to be
[1:05:35] like that one you look at Daniel in the
[1:05:38] Bible you said I want to be like that
[1:05:39] one you look at Jacob in the Bible you
[1:05:42] want to be like that one but do you know
[1:05:44] what Jacob went
[1:05:45] through he wrestled the angel until God
[1:05:50] bless
[1:05:53] him but for you seated on
[1:05:56] on your on your
[1:05:59] Flor hallelujah hallelujah what is your
[1:06:03] flow ask yourself what can I
[1:06:08] do your lamb you cannot
[1:06:13] preach but many have done
[1:06:17] it through their
[1:06:21] flows they become
[1:06:24] great they become that you're reading
[1:06:29] about look at
[1:06:31] Jesus he was born in a
[1:06:34] mang in a very poor condition that no
[1:06:37] man even can recognize
[1:06:40] him but did he not confess that he's a
[1:06:43] Son of
[1:06:45] God and think about it how can a Son of
[1:06:48] God be born
[1:06:50] in sometimes things are
[1:06:53] hidden in your weaknesses
[1:06:56] that God May reveal
[1:06:58] them to people that they will see that
[1:07:00] there's
[1:07:03] God here in the Book of John we have
[1:07:06] read about that man who was born
[1:07:11] blind but he was
[1:07:14] healed and when you Contin with the down
[1:07:17] verses the
[1:07:19] FES they started
[1:07:22] asking that who healed you but were you
[1:07:25] you born even
[1:07:27] blind they even called the parents they
[1:07:31] said was this man born
[1:07:33] blind but they had said if they say
[1:07:38] yes they're going to chase them away
[1:07:41] from the
[1:07:45] synagogue some of you even fear to give
[1:07:47] your
[1:07:49] testimony where God has brought you
[1:07:52] from so that you can edify the bride of
[1:07:54] Christ
[1:07:57] because you fear people are going to
[1:07:58] look
[1:08:01] at
[1:08:04] Amina the parents said ah he's the old
[1:08:07] man can you can ask
[1:08:09] him you can ask him and he
[1:08:13] confessed he said Jesus has saved me
[1:08:16] they CH him and he went and followed
[1:08:19] Jesus
[1:08:20] CHR they will laugh at you they will
[1:08:23] mock you go and Jesus
[1:08:26] Christ all will be
[1:08:29] well
[1:08:32] amen many have been chased from your
[1:08:35] jobs because of what you stand for
[1:08:39] continue following
[1:08:41] God is more than
[1:08:43] able he's going to use that people that
[1:08:47] what people look
[1:08:49] at as a
[1:08:52] flow in your life and change
[1:08:57] life amen sometimes it's not necess it
[1:09:01] is not necessary that what you're
[1:09:03] praying
[1:09:04] for like it is not necessary whatever
[1:09:07] you're praying
[1:09:10] for that is what you're going to receive
[1:09:13] sometimes you have to wait upon God and
[1:09:16] ask God what do you want me to do what
[1:09:18] do you want to
[1:09:21] do and God he will lead you
[1:09:25] like now this lady F
[1:09:32] CR if they ask her they her that you're
[1:09:38] blind but you're serving
[1:09:40] God but she said when you read the
[1:09:43] relics of the
[1:09:45] songs she said I see
[1:09:48] him I will see him hallelujah amen
[1:09:52] sometimes your situation may not change
[1:09:56] but if you continue with that
[1:09:58] test there's a result after
[1:10:01] that Hallelujah and I'm telling you it
[1:10:05] will be
[1:10:07] positive you

[1:10:19] passes uh that that passes all
[1:10:22] understanding of men that passes all
[1:10:24] understanding of men
[1:10:32] am look at
[1:10:35] Job the flows he had in
[1:10:38] life God had given him out that he he
[1:10:42] had allowed the devil to go and tempt
[1:10:47] him and during that situation he was
[1:10:51] in he stood with his fls
[1:10:55] invite God his friends used to come and
[1:10:59] discourage him the wife used to
[1:11:01] discourage him even your close family
[1:11:03] members can discourage you even your mom
[1:11:06] can discourage you your father can
[1:11:08] discourage
[1:11:12] you but continue standing with
[1:11:15] God you see what will come
[1:11:18] out hallelujah
[1:11:22] amen he said only one thing
[1:11:26] in job 19:
[1:11:28] 256 for I know that my redeemer
[1:11:32] liveth he shall stand at the later day
[1:11:35] upon the
[1:11:36] Earth and though after my skin my my
[1:11:40] skin warms my skin worms destroy this
[1:11:44] body yet in my
[1:11:47] flesh shall shall I see God
[1:11:55] sometimes situations eat you
[1:11:57] up but tell that
[1:12:00] situation that after this
[1:12:02] situation I will see
[1:12:07] God and as you have read we shall be
[1:12:10] with him
[1:12:11] Eternal and as he
[1:12:16] us just you
[1:12:20] confessing one day that no man knows
[1:12:25] knows no Prophet knows God is going to
[1:12:29] come and take his
[1:12:32] bride am one
[1:12:36] day he will find you with when you you
[1:12:40] are in your
[1:12:42] flaws but still holding
[1:12:46] on and turn your life
[1:12:59] here brother Bram says
[1:13:00] in why Christ
[1:13:04] speak now though his mother had told him
[1:13:07] these
[1:13:10] things he was meaning the mother of
[1:13:13] Moses and he know
[1:13:17] this yet he needed another
[1:13:21] touch no expl let me read it again you
[1:13:26] now though his mother had told him that
[1:13:29] him these things and he know this yet
[1:13:34] needed another touch the teaching was
[1:13:38] the teaching was fine but he needed a
[1:13:41] personal contact that's what the world

[1:23:38] that finally comes the
[1:23:43] Masterpiece the perfect
[1:23:45] one no fault in
[1:23:48] him at all so perfect reflected of the
[1:23:52] Builder himself
[1:23:55] his own image was reflected in in his
[1:23:58] work God and Christ were
[1:24:01] one so much until he put his own Spirit
[1:24:04] into
[1:24:07] him and then even the image of the
[1:24:10] Builder became
[1:24:12] one God and His sculpture
[1:24:16] work his
[1:24:18] Masterpiece where Moses was in the work
[1:24:22] of uh Michael Angelo
[1:24:25] sculpture work that was
[1:24:27] dead but because it had been made out of
[1:24:33] stone but here the master
