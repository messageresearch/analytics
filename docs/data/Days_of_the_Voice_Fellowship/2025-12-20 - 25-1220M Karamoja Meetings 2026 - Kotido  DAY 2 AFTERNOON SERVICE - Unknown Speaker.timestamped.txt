[0:17] And slowly we are being formed into his
[0:20] image.
[0:29] So while the man of God is coming,
[0:36] I just want you in your heart to pray
[0:38] and say, "Lord, speak to me."
[0:48] So
[0:50] don't allow anything to distract you.
[0:59] You know when Jesus came in the temple
[1:01] one time
[1:06] there were many people
[1:09] like I've heard we have about 7,000 here
[1:18] but you know when there are many people
[1:22] usually
[1:26] other people behind there go in other
[1:28] businesses.
[1:35] So they started going into the business
[1:37] of selling
[1:40] this and that
[1:46] but I don't know why you are here
[1:50] but myself
[1:53] I came here to hear from God

[2:41] sing that as pastor.
[2:50] We can do it without the music, without
[2:52] the piano, without the
[2:56] I know it's very easy. Our prophet sang
[2:59] it.
[3:05] I want all of us to try and sing it in
[3:07] English.
[3:13] The word is only believe.
[3:22] All things are possible.

[3:35] And I believe is here with us this.
[3:39] &gt;&gt; So let us sing it together.

[5:22] Gracious heavenly father,
[5:28] it is an honor for us to be here again
[5:31] tonight
[5:38] to fellowship around your word.
[5:44] May the Holy Spirit
[5:49] who is the interpreter of the word
[5:54] come and speak to us.
[6:01] Have your way.
[6:05] Have your will in our lives.
[6:11] Once again, [music] we rebuke the powers
[6:13] of the enemy.
[6:18] In the in the name of our Lord Jesus
[6:21] Christ,
[6:24] thank you Lord.
[6:28] Thank you master.
[6:33] In Jesus name we pray.
[6:37] Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[6:45] Can we say amen?

[6:50] Can we say hallelujah?
[6:52] Hallelujah.
[6:55] Can we say praise the Lord?
[7:01] Amen. Amen.
[7:04] Amen.
[7:07] I I'd like to read a scripture.
[7:14] Hebrews chapter 4 verse 1 and 2.
[7:30] The Bible reads,
[7:35] "Let us therefore fear lest a promise
[7:39] being left us of entering into his rest.
[7:44] Any of you should seem to come short of
[7:47] it. For unto us was the gospel preached
[7:50] as well as unto them. But the word
[7:53] preached did not profit them, not being
[7:57] mixed with faith in them that heard it.
[8:00] Verse three, for we which have believed
[8:03] do enter into rest, as he said, as I
[8:07] have sworn in my wrath, if they shall
[8:10] enter into my rest, although the works
[8:12] were finished from the foundation of the
[8:14] world,
[8:19] forchech.
[8:49] Foreign
[9:01] speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech.
[9:10] for
[9:39] I
[9:50] May God add blessings to the reading of
[9:53] his word.
[9:58] You may please take your seat.
[10:03] Amen.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; We want to continue from where we stop
[10:06] this afternoon.
[10:15] It's a burden in my heart
[10:23] to if God should help us
[10:30] to see the importance of the word of
[10:33] God.
[10:41] Everything that we see around us
[10:50] was made by the word of God.
[10:59] There is nothing as powerful as the word
[11:02] of God.
[11:10] God said, "Let there be and there was."
[11:14] So
[11:22] the earth,
[11:24] the sun,
[11:27] the stars,
[11:29] the stars,
[11:32] the entire universe
[11:36] was
[11:37] was created by the spoken word of God.
[11:47] Jesus said,
[11:51] "ALL [screaming] THINGS ARE POSSIBLE to
[11:54] them that believe.
[12:02] WHEN GOD SENDS HIS WORD,
[12:08] the only thing he asks of US IS TO
[12:10] BELIEVE.
[12:17] IF you are sick tonight,
[12:22] as the WORD OF GOD IS BEING PREACHED,
[12:28] I don't need to lay hands on you.
[12:34] Yes, we believe in laying hands.
[12:41] BUT IF YOUR FAITH CAN RISE TO THE LEVEL
[12:47] while the
[12:49] WHILE THE WORD IS GOING FORTH
[12:53] you can receive
[12:56] your healing. Even right now
[13:07] YOU CAN RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST AS THE
[13:09] WORD IS BEING SPOKEN.
[13:18] WHEN MEN FELL,
[13:26] men lost a sense of direction.
[13:36] BUT GOD PROMISED TO REDEEM.
[13:43] AMEN. AMEN.
[13:46] HE BROUGHT HE SENT FORTH HIS WORD
[13:51] TO HEAL OUR BODIES.
[13:57] HE SENT FORTH THE word
[14:02] to heal our spirits.
[14:09] BROTHER SAID,
[14:13] The greatest miracle
[14:20] is THE HEALING OF YOUR SOUL.
[14:33] If you are SICK
[14:37] AND YOU ARE PRAYED FOR,
[14:41] THERE'S A POSSIBILITY that tomorrow you
[14:43] can get sick again.
[14:51] BUT WHEN GOD HEAL YOUR SOUL,
[15:00] it is eternal.
[15:10] WHENEVER [screaming] WE COME TO CHURCH,
[15:18] THE REASON WHY WE COME IS BECAUSE OF THE
[15:20] WORD.
[15:28] AMEN. AMEN. THIS IS THE WAY GOD
[15:31] OPERATES. SO, [screaming]
[15:38] THE INTENTION OF GOD IS TO HEAL YOUR
[15:40] SOUL.
[15:47] HE WILL SEND HE WILL SEND A PROPHET.
[15:54] He will send PREACHERS
[16:00] when they go out.
[16:04] He gives them gifts of healing.
[16:12] Can we say amen? Amen.
[16:16] Amen. THE REASON THE REASON WHY GOD DOES
[16:19] THAT
[16:25] IS TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE
[16:27] PEOPLE.
[16:34] Praise the name of the Lord.
[16:38] AND WHEN THE PEOPLE SEE THAT GOD IS A
[16:41] GREAT GOD,
[16:48] THEN GOD WILL GO FURTHER.
[16:55] TO GIVE THEM the word.
[17:02] WHEN MOSES WENT TO EGYPT,
[17:08] HE DID A LOT OF [screaming] MIRACLES
[17:15] THAT ATTRACTED THE BELIEVERS.
[17:24] HE CALLED THE PEOPLE OUT OF EGYPT
[17:32] SO THAT THEY CAN GO TO A MOUNTAIN TO
[17:35] WORSHIP GOD.
[17:42] God told Moses,
[17:45] he said, "WHEN YOU GO TO EGYPT,
[17:51] YOU WILL BRING THESE PEOPLE BACK TO THIS
[17:53] MOUNTAIN
[17:58] SO THAT THEY CAN WORSHIP ME.
[18:06] AMEN. AMEN. AMEN.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[18:09] &gt;&gt; Moses
[18:12] brought them out.
[18:17] AND AFTER THEY'VE SEEN THE SIGNS, THE
[18:19] MIRACLES, AND THE WONDERS,
[18:26] GOD [screaming] TOLD MOSES,
[18:30] "NOW YOU COME UP THE mountain
[18:38] and I will speak to you."
[18:41] WHEN MOSES WENT UP THE MOUNTAIN,
[18:47] GOD [screaming] SHOWED him
[18:52] his plan
[18:57] THIS PEOPLE THAT HE HAD BROUGHT OUT OF
[18:59] EGYPT.
[19:05] THEY SHOULD SHOW THEM THE WAY HOW THEY
[19:09] SHOULD worship him.
[19:19] In Hebrews 8:5,
[19:25] PAUL WAS TELLING US,
[19:30] he quoted Deuteronomy.
[19:36] WHEN
[19:38] WHEN GOD CALLED MOSES,
[19:42] HE SHOWED HIM THE VISION OF THE
[19:44] TABERNACLE IN HEAVEN. [screaming]
[19:53] HE REVEALED TO THEM THE WORSHIP.
[20:02] WHATEVER MOSES WAS TO DO ON EARTH,
[20:11] GOD REVEALED IT TO MOSES ON THE
[20:13] MOUNTAIN.
[20:20] GOD [screaming] WARNED MOSES.
[20:26] He said, "MOSES,
[20:29] I KNOW YOU ARE AN ENGINEER.
[20:35] I KNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO BUILD ROADS AND
[20:37] BUILDINGS.
[20:46] I'M SENDING YOU DOWN
[20:50] TO BUILD A [screaming] HOUSE FOR ME.
[20:57] But Moses,
[21:00] see to it, MAKE SURE
[21:08] THAT YOU BUILD THIS TABERNACLE
[21:14] ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN THAT I SHOWED
[21:16] YOU IN THE MOUNTAIN.
[21:25] Praise the name OF THE LORD.
[21:30] MOSES, PROPHET MOSES
[21:35] the pattern. SO
[21:42] THE MESSAGE OF MOSES WAS WITH THEM
[21:51] WHEN WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR SOLOMON TO
[21:54] BUILD THE TABERNACLE.
[22:02] SOLOMON WENT TO THE MESSAGE [laughter]
[22:05] OF MOSES
[22:12] AND HE STUDIED THE PARDON
[22:20] THE WAY THE FOUNDATION MUST BE LAID.
[22:29] EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO BE IN THE
[22:31] TABERNACLE, MOSES HAS ALREADY GIVEN them
[22:34] the P.
[22:49] AFTER THEY AFTER THEY BUILD THE
[22:51] TABERNACLE
[22:55] ACCORDING TO WHAT MOSES SAID.
[23:02] WHEN THEY WERE DEDICATING THE
[23:04] TABERNACLE,
[23:09] GOD WAS SO HAPPY.
[23:15] THE GLORY OF GOD [screaming]
[23:19] filled the TABERNACLE
[23:23] until until the MINISTERS
[23:28] WERE NOT ABLE TO MINISTER.
[23:34] WHY?
[23:36] BECAUSE
[23:39] I FOLLOW [screaming] THE WORD OF THE
[23:41] LORD.
[23:46] LIKE I SAID THIS AFTERNOON,
[23:53] IF WE WANT GOD TO ACCEPT US,
[24:00] WHATEVER WE DO,
[24:04] IT IT MUST BE DONE ACCORDING TO THE WORD
[24:07] OF THE LORD.
[24:13] AMEN.
[24:19] AMEN. AMEN. AMEN.
[24:22] LISTEN.
[24:25] ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE
[24:30] IF WE TAKE THE word of GOD [screaming]
[24:36] AND ACT UPON THE WORD OF GOD.
[24:39] [screaming]
[24:41] THERE IS NOTHING
[24:45] can stand.
[24:49] NOTHING CAN STAND BEFORE THE WORD OF
[24:51] GOD.
[24:58] AMEN. AMEN.
[25:00] AFTER MOSES left
[25:07] the ark of the covenant.
[25:12] MOSES,
[25:15] Moses said,
[25:19] "THE MINISTERS
[25:23] MUST TAKE THE ARK OF THE COVENANT.
[25:32] put it on their shoulder
[25:39] AND THEY WILL GO BEFORE THE PEOPLE.
[25:47] AMEN. AMEN. The the PROPHET
[25:54] THE PROPHET WAS NOT AROUND.
[26:00] BUT THE BUT THE WORD OF GOD WAS WITH
[26:03] THEM.
[26:08] AS THEY HELD ONTO THE WORLD [screaming]
[26:13] and they were walking,
[26:17] THEY WERE GOING TO WASH JORDAN.

[26:55] WHEN THEY CROSS OVER,
[27:02] THERE WAS A WALL OF JERO.
[27:10] THAT WALL WAS SO BIG
[27:17] THAT YOU COULD DRIVE CHARIOTS IN THEM.
[27:28] JOSHUA
[27:32] WHO IS NOW THE COMMANDER.
[27:37] He have lived with Moses.
[27:42] HE HAS OBSERVED MOSES.
[27:47] HE'S
[27:49] HE'S NOT TELLING THE CHURCH.
[27:55] Let a priest
[28:00] take the WORD
[28:04] AND GO AROUND [screaming] THE WALL OF
[28:06] JERICHO.
[28:12] Seven [screaming] days.
[28:16] ON THE SEVENTH DAY,
[28:21] THEY SHALL GO AROUND IT SEVEN TIMES.
[28:29] At the END OF THE SEVEN DAYS,
[28:31] [screaming]
[28:33] THEY SHOULD SHOUT. THEY SHOULD SHOUT.
[28:40] AND WHEN THEY OBEYED THE [screaming]

[42:14] I'VE SHOWN US HOW OUR SISTER SHOULD
[42:16] REST.
[42:21] HOW THE [screaming] BROTHER SHOULD REST.
[42:26] IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU ARE.
[42:29] If you are A BELIEVER,
[42:32] WHAT ARE YOU BELIEVING?
[42:35] THE WORD OF THE [screaming] LORD.
[42:37] WE ARE A BELIEVER of the word.
[42:41] A believer.
[42:44] A believer.
[42:47] Believer.
[42:49] Believe the [screaming] word of God.
[42:54] WE CALL OURSELVES MESSAGE BELIEVERS.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[43:01] &gt;&gt; WE BELIEVE THAT GOD HAS SENT US A
[43:03] MESSAGE.
[43:07] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. TO SERVE GOD
[43:10] CORRECTLY,
[43:13] WE MUST COME TO THE MESSAGE
[43:17] AND CONSULT THE MESSAGE.
[43:24] YES. LISTEN. AMEN. One day
[43:29] God had blessed King David
[43:34] to be a king
[43:37] is so prosper.
[43:41] He had a desire
[43:44] to bring the ark [music] of the covenant
[43:49] back to Israel
[43:53] after the Philistines took it.
[43:59] The same mistake we are making TODAY
[44:05] a prophet in the land.
[44:10] Instead of David consulting the prophet,
[44:17] he consulted the generals.
[44:25] Amen. Amen. And they adise him,
[44:30] King,
[44:32] what we should do,
[44:35] let's build a cart
[44:40] and let's put the ark on that cart
[44:49] and let's bring the ark back.
[44:54] He was so nice.
[44:58] I thought where did David get that idea
[45:01] from?
[45:06] David never consulted Moses message.
[45:14] He never consulted the prophet.
[45:21] I think what happened one day,
[45:25] Israel lost the the ark of the covenant.
[45:32] I believe it went in the hands of the
[45:34] Philistine. one night
[45:37] the Philistines
[45:40] and God plagued them. I plague the
[45:42] Philistines. So,
[45:45] and they said
[45:49] let's take the ark and send it back
[45:53] or let's put a car
[45:57] and put the ark there.
[46:01] And if this if this goes back to Israel,
[46:08] we know that their God is is God.
[46:15] church.
[46:19] When they place the WORD
[46:23] upon the animals,
[46:26] the power of the word,
[46:30] DIRECTED THOSE ANIMALS [screaming]
[46:34] straight to Jerusalem.
[46:40] The power of [screaming] the WORD
[46:44] SAID BY WORD HAVE I HE IN MY HEART.
[46:46] [screaming]
[46:50] WHEN YOU KEEP THE WORD IN YOUR HEART,
[46:53] THE POWER OF [screaming] THE WORD
[46:56] WILL LEAVE YOU. HALLELUJAH.
[47:00] THE POWER OF THE [screaming] WORD
[47:03] WILL PROTECT YOU.
[47:06] THE WORD OF GOD
[47:08] WILL FIGHT YOUR BATTLES.
[47:13] HALLELUJAH. [screaming] AMEN.
[47:16] But listen,
[47:19] the Philistines were not under the
[47:22] covenant that Israel was.
[47:32] I want to advise you.
[47:35] Don't copy the denominations.
[47:42] There are things that they would do and
[47:44] get by.
[47:50] Are you with me?
[47:54] Maybe David got the idea.
[47:59] This is what the Philistians did.
[48:02] But the INSTRUCTIONS
[48:05] of God TO ISRAEL
[48:08] THROUGH THE prophet Moses.
[48:11] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WHENEVER THE WORD IS
[48:14] COMING
[48:18] by the priest.
[48:22] HALLELUJAH.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[48:25] AND SO
[48:27] BECAUSE [screaming] DAVID NEVER OBEY
[48:29] INSTRUCTIONS OF PROPHET MOSES

[48:42] THE POWERFUL
[48:47] WAS REJOICING

[49:18] [screaming]
[49:19] KILL HIM RIGHT
[49:23] BECAUSE THEY NEVER FOLLOWED THE
[49:25] INSTRUCTION. [screaming]
[49:32] YES, IT IS VERY [screaming] VERY
[49:35] IMPORTANT
[49:39] as pastors,
[49:41] AS MINISTERS
[49:44] BECAUSE YOU ARE LEADING THE SOULS OF
[49:46] MEN. [screaming]
[49:49] THE LORD OF PEOPLE IS IN YOUR HANDS.
[49:52] [screaming]
[49:55] WE MUST BE VERY SERIOUS.
[49:59] YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL.
[50:02] IF YOU TELL THEM THE WRONG THING,
[50:06] GOD WILL REQUIRE THEIR BLOOD AT YOUR
[50:08] HANDS. [screaming]
[50:12] AMEN.
[50:14] THE ONLY [screaming] THING
[50:16] THAT we should DO
[50:22] is to go for the message.
[50:26] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THE WAY WE RUN OUR
[50:29] CHURCHES,
[50:33] we should do it.
[50:38] IF YOU BRING TRADITION,

[50:44] IDEAS,

[51:14] you will succeed.
[51:18] You know the reason why we have problems
[51:20] even our homes and marriages
[51:25] because we don't want to follow the
[51:27] word.
[51:30] Some of you you have problem.
[51:34] You come to the pastor.
[51:36] The pastor will show you the word of
[51:37] God.
[51:40] But you turn your [music] back from the
[51:41] word of God
[51:46] and then you run into trouble.
[51:53] Many are in situations today
[52:00] because
[52:01] they refuse the word.
[52:08] The scripture say don't smoke.
[52:13] Drinking is not good.
[52:17] And some of us are going to church and
[52:19] still drinking.
[52:26] Sometimes you see preachers that are
[52:27] preaching behind the pulpit, but they
[52:29] are sleeping with the women in the
[52:30] church.
[52:39] They have girlfriends in the dark.
[52:43] YOUR CHURCH MEMBER MAY NOT SEE YOU.
[52:52] YOUR FAMILY MAY NOT KNOW,
[52:56] BUT THERE'S SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS.
[52:58] [screaming]

[56:20] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[56:23] AMEN.
[56:25] SOME OF US
[56:27] [screaming] WE WORSHIP SPIRITS.
[56:32] ANCESTRAL SPIRIT.

[57:12] The only thing that God want you to do
[57:13] is to believe.
[57:20] One day you will die.
[57:24] Oh, you say I'm powerful.
[57:31] Are you powerful than [music] God?
[57:37] God sent us a prophet.
[57:42] So that we
[57:44] can accept that prophet
[57:47] and what that prophet says.
[57:50] Then when we take that prophet what he
[57:52] says
[57:57] then and then we will be changed.
[58:03] You see
[58:05] we cannot go to heaven with the way we
[58:07] are.
[58:10] I want to show you something in the
[58:12] scripture.
[58:15] Abraham was an idol worshipper. Abraham
[58:21] God came to him.
[58:24] He said, "Abraham,
[58:26] come out
[58:28] of your father.
[58:32] Come out of your tribe.
[58:34] Come out of your city.
[58:37] come and follow me.
[58:42] In other words,
[58:44] when we come to [music] God,
[58:47] we move out of our traditions.
[58:52] Can we say amen? AMEN. GOD DELIVER YOU
[58:55] from the tribal spirit.
[59:01] The message will DELIVER YOU FROM YOUR
[59:03] FAMILY SPIRIT.

[1:01:32] trouble.

[1:01:44] Paulo
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; was saying,
[1:01:48] "I marvel. I'm so surprised
[1:01:54] that you are soon shaken."
[1:01:59] You are very quick to move away from the
[1:02:01] word of God.
[1:02:06] He said, "Who have bewitched you?
[1:02:13] He was telling Timothy,
[1:02:16] [music]
[1:02:18] "The things you see in me, the things
[1:02:20] that I have done,
[1:02:23] the way I preach,
[1:02:25] the things I train you, I show you the
[1:02:28] word.
[1:02:30] Commit the same thing to faithful men
[1:02:37] who will TEACH OTHERS ALSO.
[1:02:41] PRAISE THE LORD. WE MUST BE FAITHFUL TO
[1:02:44] THE MESSAGE.
[1:02:51] LISTEN,
[1:02:53] Moses was no more around.
[1:02:57] It was Joshua
[1:03:00] and the church. BUT BECAUSE JOSHUA
[1:03:04] was meditating upon THE WORD OF MOSES,
[1:03:12] ONE DAY,
[1:03:14] you know, when you listen to the word of
[1:03:17] God, it gives you faith.
[1:03:22] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THE
[1:03:25] WORD OF GOD, IT GIVES YOU FAITH.
[1:03:32] JOSHUA JOSHUA HAVE GREAT CHALLENGES
[1:03:36] AHEAD OF HIM.
[1:03:39] I BELIEVE IN THE MESSAGE OF THE PROPHET.
[1:03:44] HE WAS MEDITATING ON THE MESSAGE.
[1:03:49] And one evening
[1:03:51] as he was WALKING AROUND,
[1:03:54] he saw a man
[1:03:56] dressed in a military attire.
[1:04:00] JOSHUA
[1:04:02] IS under commission.
[1:04:06] HE SAID, "ARE YOU ARE YOU AGAINST US?"
[1:04:15] The angels
[1:04:19] say, "I am
[1:04:22] the captain
[1:04:25] of the host of the Lord's army."
[1:04:29] AND JOSHUA
[1:04:31] SALUTED
[1:04:34] Joshua
[1:04:35] worship.
[1:04:38] AMEN. [screaming] AMEN.
[1:04:40] AMEN.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Joshua
[1:04:46] continue meditating.
[1:04:50] They were at war.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; They had a war. The sword was going
[1:04:55] down.
[1:04:58] Joshua,
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; he never even prayed
[1:05:03] because he has believed the word.
[1:05:07] Amen. He just look at the son.
[1:05:11] He say, "Son,
[1:05:13] stand still."
[1:05:17] AMEN. THE POWER [screaming] OF THE
[1:05:19] SPOKEN WORD.
[1:05:23] [screaming] MOSES WAS NOT around
[1:05:27] but the God of MOSES
[1:05:33] is [screaming] not here.
[1:05:37] OF THE GOD OF
[1:05:39] IS HERE TONIGHT. [screaming]
[1:05:43] AMEN. HE'S THE SAME
[1:05:46] YESTERDAY, [screaming]
[1:05:48] TODAY
[1:05:50] AND FOREVER.
[1:05:53] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:05:55] AMEN. THE ONLY THING THE ANGEL WANT YOU
[1:05:57] TO DO IS TO BELIEVE
[1:06:03] THE PURE MESSAGE.
[1:06:06] [screaming]
[1:06:09] DROP THE IDEAS OF MEN.
[1:06:13] CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. IT DOESN'T MATTER
[1:06:19] who that person MAY BE,
[1:06:22] WHETHER he's a white man,
[1:06:25] WHETHER HE'S A BLACK MAN,
[1:06:27] WHETHER HE'S FROM AMERICA,
[1:06:30] WHETHER HE'S FROM AUSTRALIA,
[1:06:32] AND THEY BRING SOMETHING TO YOU.
[1:06:34] [screaming]
[1:06:36] THE PROPHET NEVER SAID
[1:06:40] [screaming] IT.
[1:06:43] AMEN.
[1:06:45] [screaming]
[1:06:50] AMEN.
[1:06:53] Paul said this
[1:06:55] after my DEPARTURE
[1:07:00] will come.
[1:07:04] Sometimes
[1:07:07] he s to say but people come
[1:07:10] to Jesus
[1:07:12] and people were following him.
[1:07:15] Now remember Jesus is the word.
[1:07:19] Jesus knew
[1:07:21] some of the people that were coming to
[1:07:22] the service is for the bread.
[1:07:27] looking to convention
[1:07:30] they killing goats.
[1:07:36] They never came to Jesus service for the
[1:07:39] word. [screaming]
[1:07:44] They came for the food.
[1:07:56] Some of you
[1:07:58] the service is going on
[1:08:03] and you are doing boyfriend and
[1:08:04] girlfriend somewhere there.
[1:08:08] Don't you fear God?
[1:08:20] Some came TO
[1:08:22] because of the miracles.
[1:08:28] Bible says
[1:08:30] Jesus
[1:08:32] Jesus
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; never committed himself TO ANY OF THOSE.
[1:08:43] BECAUSE HE KNEW what was in man.
[1:08:49] You know even we preachers
[1:08:52] we have to be very careful
[1:08:56] so that we not build a following to
[1:08:58] ourselves.
[1:09:04] We are here to POINT PEOPLE TO CHRIST.
[1:09:26] IF MY BROTHER JOHN Mark here
[1:09:32] is Christ,
[1:09:36] my responsibility
[1:09:40] as a minister
[1:09:43] is to take your hand
[1:09:46] and connect you with Christ.
[1:09:52] Are we together?
[1:09:54] So that you can have a personal
[1:09:56] experience with Christ.
[1:10:02] But if I am holding Christ [screaming]
[1:10:06] and they are holding ME
[1:10:09] AND YOU DON'T know who Christ is
[1:10:13] if I leave Christ,
[1:10:17] how do you know that I've left him?
[1:10:22] Because you DON'T KNOW HIM.
[1:10:24] THAT IS WHY JESUS SAID
[1:10:27] WHEN THE BLIND LEAVES THE BLIND
[1:10:29] [screaming]
[1:10:32] they fall into the ditch.
[1:10:37] WE ARE NOT HERE TO MAKE NAME FOR
[1:10:39] OURSELVES. [screaming]
[1:10:47] WE ARE NOT HERE FOR PEOPLE TO WORSHIP
[1:10:49] US.
[1:10:52] OH, HERE COME THE bishop from New York.
[1:10:58] YORK IS THAT THAT'S NONSENSE.
[1:11:04] Blessed be the name of THE LORD.
[1:11:08] WE ARE HERE TO EXURE JESUS CHRIST.
[1:11:14] WE ARE HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THE MESSAGE
[1:11:16] [screaming] OF
[1:11:20] is the truth.
[1:11:24] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]

[1:11:31] Believe the prophet.
[1:11:35] Listen to the word of God.

[1:11:43] WHEN YOU ARE PREACHING TO YOUR CHURCH
[1:11:46] [screaming]
[1:11:47] HAS PREACHED
[1:11:53] YOU WERE NOT THERE.
[1:11:56] I WAS NOT THERE WHEN GOD MET WILLIAM
[1:11:59] BRHAM.
[1:12:04] WHEN MOSES
[1:12:06] WENT TO THE MOUNTAIN,
[1:12:09] NOBODY [screaming] WAS THERE.
[1:12:11] IT WAS MOSES AND GOD ALONE.
[1:12:15] The children of Israel.
[1:12:19] including Aaron the high priest
[1:12:25] have to believe what Moses say.
[1:12:30] CAN I SAY AMEN? AMEN. THAT IS WHY
[1:12:34] [screaming] WHEN GOD SENDS A PROPHET,
[1:12:40] WHEN GOD SENDS A PROPHET,
[1:12:46] he vindicates the man
[1:12:52] so that the people
[1:12:54] without any shadow of DOUBT
[1:13:00] will take What that prophet is saying,
[1:13:08] there's never been a day
[1:13:11] since the time of Adam
[1:13:16] that God
[1:13:18] took a picture
[1:13:22] with a prophet.
[1:13:27] GOD,
[1:13:29] HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN. TOOK A PICTURE
[1:13:33] WHEN PEOPLE WERE DOUBTING MINISTRY
[1:13:38] [screaming]
[1:13:39] came down

[1:17:42] REMEMBER,
[1:17:45] REMEMBER
[1:17:47] JESUS SAID TO THE disciples
[1:17:51] who do men say that I the son of man.
[1:17:56] Some said
[1:17:58] master. I heard somebody were saying you
[1:17:59] you are Elijah.
[1:18:04] Others were saying you are Jeremiah.
[1:18:08] Some were saying John the Baptist has
[1:18:09] come back.
[1:18:12] says, "That's fine."
[1:18:15] He did not say that they were wrong
[1:18:19] because
[1:18:21] Christ
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; was in Jeremiah.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Christ was in David.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Christ was in Isaiah.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Ethopian Enoch when they act
[1:18:35] Enoch,
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; he was reading THE BOOK OF ISAIAH.
[1:18:43] Who is the prophet speaking about here?
[1:18:45] Is he speaking of himself or he speaking
[1:18:48] of another person?
[1:18:57] WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD COME UPON THEM,
[1:19:01] WHEN THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST COME UPON
[1:19:03] THEM,
[1:19:04] THEY BEGIN TO ACT like Christ.
[1:19:08] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. DAVID [screaming]
[1:19:12] DAVID WAS REJECTED
[1:19:16] BORN UP TO THE MOUNTAIN
[1:19:20] OLIVES
[1:19:21] AND HE BEGIN TO CRY
[1:19:24] BECAUSE HIS OWN PEOPLE REJECTED HIM.
[1:19:28] WHAT WAS HE DOING? HE WAS ACTING THE
[1:19:31] LIFE OF CHRIST.
[1:19:36] ISAAC
[1:19:38] WAS BEARING THE ON HIS OWN CROSS THE
[1:19:41] WOOD THAT he was GOING TO DIE ON. SO,
[1:19:46] [screaming]
[1:19:48] CAN I SAY AMEN?
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; JOSEPH
[1:19:52] WAS IN PRISON.
[1:19:54] THERE WERE TWO PRISONERS.
[1:19:58] ONE DIED.
[1:20:00] THE OTHER ONE WENT TO THE THRONE.
[1:20:03] JESUS WAS ON THE CROSS.
[1:20:09] THERE WERE TWO THIEVES
[1:20:13] and went to hell.
[1:20:15] [screaming]
[1:20:16] ONE ASKED FOR REPENTANCE AND HE WENT to
[1:20:18] paradise.
[1:20:22] THE LIVES OF THOSE PROPHETS
[1:20:26] WERE ACTING OUT THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST
[1:20:28] IN PORTIONS. SO
[1:20:34] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN JESUS CAME,
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus was Elijah.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; JESUS WAS ISAIAH.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; JESUS was Moses.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; MOSES SAID, "THE LORD your God,
[1:20:54] a prophet like me."
[1:21:00] HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN THAT PROPHET COMES,
[1:21:04] listen to what he tells you.
[1:21:08] WHEN MOSES
[1:21:10] WAS BORN,

[1:22:06] WORD,
[1:22:09] he asked them, "Who do men say that I
[1:22:11] am?"
[1:22:15] Some people
[1:22:17] were still having their denominational
[1:22:19] explanation
[1:22:24] of who Jesus was.
[1:22:28] But it was the present truth.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus is now
[1:22:36] is more than Jeremiah, more than Isaiah,
[1:22:39] more than Ezekiel.
[1:22:45] It was all of the word complete.
[1:22:51] After they gave the questions,
[1:22:54] they answered, they gave the answers,
[1:22:59] he said
[1:23:02] the Christ,
[1:23:05] THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD,
[1:23:09] Jesus said,
[1:23:12] "FLESH AND [screaming] BLOOD
[1:23:16] HAS NOT REVEALED THIS FOR YOU."
[1:23:19] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:23:22] FLESH AND BLOOD MEANS
[1:23:26] YOUR PASTOR
[1:23:29] CANNOT give you revelation.
[1:23:35] BIBLE SCHOOL [screaming]
[1:23:38] cannot give you revelation.

[1:23:47] FROM ENGLAND, ENGLAND CAN GIVE YOU
[1:23:50] REVELATION

[1:24:01] YES. LISTEN.
[1:24:05] We don't fight for our [music] God.

[1:24:26] they fight for their God.
[1:24:30] They can kill for their God, for Allah.
[1:24:35] We are NOT MUSLIMS.

[1:28:30] THAT COMING OUT IS NOT A DESTINATION.

[1:28:41] The coming out
[1:28:44] Egypt,
[1:28:45] out of the denomination
[1:28:47] is not the final destination.
[1:28:51] After you have come out,
[1:28:54] there is a message.
[1:28:56] There's a guide that knows the way.
[1:29:04] WHEN I CAME HERE IN UGANDA,
[1:29:07] THAT'S MY FIRST TIME OF COMING.
[1:29:10] I DON'T KNOW THE COUNTRY.
[1:29:13] I DON'T KNOW THE COUNTRY. I HAVE TO

[1:34:37] And you ARE LOST.

[1:39:01] God called you as a minister
[1:39:06] to support the pastor,
[1:39:11] a preacher,
[1:39:13] but maybe you are not called to be a
[1:39:14] pastor,
[1:39:18] but because you are in church
[1:39:21] close the pastor

[1:39:35] I want to be pastor."
[1:39:38] Do you know that split started in
[1:39:40] heaven?
[1:39:49] When you see somebody begin to go among
[1:39:52] the people,
[1:39:57] talk against the pastor, this thing is
[1:39:59] not right. This thing is not right.
[1:40:03] It's not the spirit of God.
[1:40:07] Yes. Praise the NAME OF THE LORD. IT IS

[1:48:22] there
[1:48:24] where you are.
[1:48:27] If you have pain [music] in your body,
[1:48:31] I don't care which part of the body it
[1:48:33] is
[1:48:34] or your stomach or your head or your

[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; I rebuke that pain.
[1:48:57] I command it to disappear right now.

[1:49:38] You are here not only to heal the body,
[1:49:42] but you are here Lord Jesus
[1:49:45] to heal the spirit and the soul.
[1:49:50] Father Lord, perhaps there have been
[1:49:52] people here
[1:49:54] that have been living in sin,
[1:49:57] but Lord, you've called out that sin,
[1:50:02] rebuke that sin,
[1:50:04] and Lord, you are here
[1:50:06] to heal the sick
[1:50:09] in their soul.
[1:50:12] Listen, listen, saints,
[1:50:15] please keep your eyes closed if you can.
[1:50:18] We have enough space here.
[1:50:21] And for just a few moments,
[1:50:23] if you've been living in sin,
[1:50:27] but you heard the word call your name,
[1:50:31] I'm going to give you an opportunity.

[1:50:48] care what sin it is.
[1:50:52] Because the God of the message is alive.
[1:50:56] He's a living God.
[1:50:58] Don't lose this opportunity.
[1:51:01] Right now, as I speak
[1:51:03] slowly,

[1:51:08] anything.

[2:00:31] I want you to listen to me.
[2:00:40] I want you to listen to me.
[2:00:45] Listen.
[2:00:48] Listen.
[2:00:53] That same spirit, that same spirit
[2:00:58] that used a preacher
[2:01:04] convicted you to come here.
[2:01:08] When God looks at you,
[2:01:11] he doesn't look at you through your sin
[2:01:16] because you have confessed it.
[2:01:22] He looks at you through the blood.
[2:01:28] When you leave this place,
[2:01:31] you are going to go and make things
[2:01:33] right.
[2:01:36] Maybe you have to make things right with
[2:01:38] someone.
[2:01:41] Maybe you have to meet your pastor for
[2:01:43] counsel.
[2:01:48] Go and make things right.
[2:01:51] But before you leave this place,
[2:01:54] I want you to know that same spirit that
[2:01:57] convicted you
[2:02:01] is a living God.
[2:02:03] And you're not going to do this on your
[2:02:05] own
[2:02:07] or else you leave this place and then
[2:02:09] you continue with the kind of life that
[2:02:10] you are living.
[2:02:15] But I want I have some good news for
[2:02:17] you.
[2:02:21] That same God that convicted you
[2:02:25] wants to dwell in your heart.
[2:02:30] He wants to feed you.
[2:02:33] with himself.
[2:02:36] That's the power that overcomes the
[2:02:39] world.
[2:02:42] If only you can receive his spirit,
[2:02:46] you will never be the same again.
[2:02:51] You will have love in your heart for
[2:02:52] everyone.
[2:02:55] You will have no room of bitterness in
[2:02:58] your heart.
[2:03:00] That sin that has been controlling you
[2:03:04] cannot [music] after this control you
[2:03:06] anymore
[2:03:11] because God would be in your soul.
[2:03:14] You will have the love to read the
[2:03:17] message and and listen to the message
[2:03:19] and read the word.
[2:03:23] You will desire to go to church and hear
[2:03:25] the word being preached.
[2:03:30] You will no longer cause trouble in your
[2:03:32] home.
[2:03:34] This is what happens when the Holy Ghost
[2:03:36] comes.
[2:03:40] Do you believe
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; that he can fill you now?
[2:03:46] The Holy Spirit.
[2:03:50] Now listen,
[2:03:53] it is easy.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; The only thing you have to do is to
[2:03:56] believe.
[2:03:58] Now I want you to lift up your hands
[2:04:01] and ask him to fill you
[2:04:07] filled me with the Holy Spirit.
[2:04:14] Well, if you believe it,
[2:04:16] he will feel you just now.
[2:04:21] You feel you just now?
[2:04:24] Well, lift up your hands and believe it.

[2:05:01] to change a sinner into a s

[2:13:28] Amen. Amen. God bless you my sister.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Well, God bless you saints.
[2:13:34] As the Lord bless you tonight,
[2:13:37] I turn it over to the pastor.
[2:13:41] Before I turn it over to the pastor,
[2:13:44] I ask four brothers to come here. Four
[2:13:45] brothers.
[2:13:47] Four brothers. Before the pastor comes,
[2:13:49] four brothers, come four brothers. I
[2:13:52] want to we we've learned something that
[2:13:54] I need I needed I thought I I needed to
[2:13:57] um
[2:13:58] uh I don't know how they call it but I
[2:14:00] need to demonstrate it for you.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; So this one
[2:14:09] this one is Christ.
[2:14:13] That's what our pastor demonstrated for
[2:14:14] us
[2:14:17] brother.
[2:14:20] So he's representing Christ.
[2:14:23] This one is representing a brother
[2:14:28] believes in Christ.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; So because he believes in Christ,
[2:14:34] hold him.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Hold him.
[2:14:38] He He believes in Christ.
[2:14:42] This one is representing a brother
[2:14:46] who is following a brother.
[2:14:50] that believes in Christ.
[2:14:52] Hold that, brother.
[2:14:54] Hold him tight.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, brother. You have to. Yes.
[2:15:01] Okay. Okay. You don't need to shake. No
[2:15:03] problem.
[2:15:05] Now, this one is also representing a
[2:15:09] brother
[2:15:11] who believes in a brother
[2:15:14] and believes in Christ.
[2:15:18] Keep holding on Christ.
[2:15:24] Hold.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Now the pastor preached to us even in
[2:15:28] the morning.
[2:15:29] Listen, listen attentively.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; And he said, listen, I want you to
[2:15:36] understand this.
[2:15:38] And he said,
[2:15:40] the message of the hour
[2:15:43] is Christ.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; Listen. Just listen.
[2:15:48] The message is not brotherham.
[2:15:52] Brother Brham was the carrier [music] of
[2:15:54] the message
[2:15:58] but the message is Christ.
[2:16:02] So that's why
[2:16:05] that's why listen
[2:16:07] okay I I I I just listen just listen
[2:16:10] now. That's why
[2:16:13] brother Brham taught
[2:16:17] God told him
[2:16:19] he told it
[2:16:23] will be food for my bride in the end
[2:16:26] time
[2:16:32] because when you listen
[2:16:34] now when you read
[2:16:37] this is the audio which was put in
[2:16:38] [music] books by the way.
[2:16:43] When the pastor takes it
[2:16:47] and he quotes it for you
[2:16:52] believers,
[2:16:54] it means we believe that message
[2:16:57] and the pastors who believe that message
[2:16:59] will not be afraid of taking it and say
[2:17:01] brother says
[2:17:06] and we quote it. That's why your pastors
[2:17:09] do that because we are message
[2:17:11] believers.
[2:17:13] What is the message? It's not brother.
[2:17:17] The man is dead many years ago.
[2:17:20] But this message which was recorded
[2:17:24] is Christ.
[2:17:26] So brother
[2:17:28] pointing us
[2:17:33] and be deceived
[2:17:35] that the Bible is something else.
[2:17:40] When you when when you read the message,
[2:17:42] when you feed on the message, then your
[2:17:46] understanding of the Bible becomes
[2:17:48] fruitful.
[2:17:53] We had the Bible in the denominations
[2:17:57] and we were blind.
[2:18:01] BUT WHEN WE RECEIVE THE MESSAGE OF THE
[2:18:02] HOUR,
[2:18:04] so when we open our Bibles,
[2:18:07] we can now see Christ.
[2:18:10] We can now see one.
[2:18:12] We can now see water baptism in Jesus.
[2:18:17] That our sisters are cannot be preachers
[2:18:19] or pastors.
[2:18:23] WHERE THESE TEACHINGS COME FROM.
[2:18:27] IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE BIBLE,
[2:18:30] but it was hid
[2:18:33] from the wise from the eyes of the wise
[2:18:35] and the blind.
[2:18:37] But by GOD'S GRACE
[2:18:39] IN OUR DAY, like in the days of Moses,
[2:18:44] he sent us a message
[2:18:47] with a message
[2:18:50] that identifies Christ in our age.
[2:18:56] Now
[2:18:57] we have all been believing.
[2:19:01] This one is you. This one is you. This
[2:19:04] one is you.
[2:19:07] believers of different ages.
[2:19:14] This one can even be your pastor
[2:19:17] or your apostle or your teacher. Maybe
[2:19:20] this one is your deacon
[2:19:22] or maybe this one is whatever it does
[2:19:24] represents all that.
[2:19:26] So this is the message.
[2:19:31] Now you see how
[2:19:35] you are holding
[2:19:40] the pastor said something
[2:19:43] as he was preaching which I wanted to
[2:19:44] demonstrate for you.
[2:19:46] He said, "If we only do that
[2:19:49] and you hold on to this man,
[2:19:55] if you just hold on to this man, it is
[2:19:58] fine for as long as is holding Christ.
[2:20:04] BUT HERE IS THE PROBLEM.
[2:20:08] Here is the problem
[2:20:11] that we many times do.
[2:20:16] When this man lets go of Christ,
[2:20:22] Christ remains where he was.
[2:20:26] And then this man holds on to another
[2:20:28] one
[2:20:32] following.
[2:20:35] YOU SEE WHAT IS happening
[2:20:38] now? WHERE IS CHRIST?
[2:20:42] WHERE IS CHRIST?
[2:20:44] CHRIST IS IN THE PLACE WHERE HE WAS AT
[2:20:46] THE FIRST TIME.
[2:20:51] SO WHAT IS THE MESSAGE?
[2:20:54] THE MESSAGE is Christ
[2:20:58] to say it in a very simple way. So now
[2:20:59] what I'm TRYING TO SAY
[2:21:01] THE MESSAGE HAS NEVER CHANGED.
[2:21:07] IT IS THE SAME MESSAGE.
[2:21:09] WHY DO MEN COME WITH FAKE DOCTRINES AND
[2:21:11] THIS AND THAT AND IDEAS AND OPINIONS?
[2:21:18] Because they are not following the
[2:21:19] messages.
[2:21:21] They are following [music] something.
[2:21:24] See how MANY ARE LOST. SEE HOW many are
[2:21:26] lost. See how many are lost.
[2:21:30] WHEN THE BLIND FOLLOW THE BLIND,
[2:21:34] all fall into the ditch.
[2:21:38] But the pastor gave us a solution for
[2:21:40] that.
[2:21:43] And he has said
[2:21:45] HERE IS HOW THE RIGHT PERSON SHOULD DO.
[2:21:49] OH,
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; I LOVE THIS. THEY ALL FOLLOWING.
[2:21:53] HE SAID THIS HOW IT SHOULD BE.
[2:21:57] His first brother
[2:22:00] should hold on to Christ.
[2:22:04] Hold hold him.
[2:22:07] Now when this one wants to know Christ,
[2:22:13] hold him on another hand.
[2:22:17] THIS IS WHAT WE AS PREACHERS SHOULD DO.
[2:22:21] Even as believers
[2:22:23] because we are the light in our
[2:22:25] villages.
[2:22:27] You are the light of the message in your
[2:22:28] village.
[2:22:32] WHEN YOU GET PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KNOW
[2:22:38] HOLD THEM BY THE hand
[2:22:40] and lead them to Christ.
[2:22:43] Make him hold. Make him hold.
[2:22:46] Bring another one.
[2:22:49] Make him hold another side.
[2:22:52] Are there MORE? ARE THERE MORE?
[2:22:54] COME ON. COME. COME. COME.
[2:22:57] COME.
[2:23:00] Make them hold. Brother.
[2:23:03] You are holding. Don't be jealous.
[2:23:08] Make them hold. Make them hold.
[2:23:12] That's how it has to be.
[2:23:15] SO ALL THESE PEOPLE,
[2:23:19] all these PEOPLE
[2:23:22] ARE feeding from the same message,
[2:23:28] from the same spot, from the same
[2:23:30] spirit, the same anointing.
[2:23:35] And that is why my brothers and sisters,
[2:23:39] we must read the message.
[2:23:44] GOD HAS GIVEN US GOOD PASTORS.
[2:23:47] Where is the pastor? Where was the
[2:23:51] here?
[2:23:52] God has given us good pastors.
[2:23:55] But good pastors
[2:23:57] will always lead us to the message
[2:24:02] will always not lead us to themselves
[2:24:04] but to Christ.
[2:24:08] They will not talk about themselves.
[2:24:11] They will talk about Christ
[2:24:14] there.
[2:24:17] God bless you brothers. You can go back.
[2:24:24] And that is what Pastor Simon has been
[2:24:26] laboring [music and singing] to do.
[2:24:32] Lead all of us to Christ.
[2:24:37] That's what that's what Apostle did.
[2:24:43] That's what these pastors, these elders
[2:24:45] are doing.
[2:24:48] That's what I am doing.
[2:24:50] That's what every one of us should do.
[2:24:56] And we want to say thank God for the
[2:24:59] message.
[2:25:04] Thank God for the message.
[2:25:06] We have a song that says
[2:25:10] is the old time Holy Spirit.
[2:25:14] The devil won't go near it.
[2:25:17] That's the reason why people fear it.
[2:25:22] It's good enough for me.
[2:25:24] It makes me love everybody.
[2:25:28] I I recently I told people in my church,
[2:25:30] I don't have enemy. I don't have one
[2:25:32] enemy. One enemy.
[2:25:36] I love everyone.
[2:25:39] And I mean it. In all my life, I don't
[2:25:43] have person I hate.
[2:25:46] That's what the message will do.
[2:25:49] When Christ comes into your heart, he
[2:25:52] will give you love even for your
[2:25:53] enemies.
[2:25:57] Amen.
[2:25:58] Amen.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; So I want to say God bless you pastor
[2:26:03] Simon.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; Can we all say God bless you?
[2:26:12] Pastor
[2:26:15] God bless you.
[2:26:17] Do we appreciate
[2:26:35] let's thank God
[2:26:43] in the year 2011
[2:26:50] We the late Apostle John Mark had
[2:26:54] friends who came from the US.
[2:27:00] [music]
[2:27:01] Uh one of them was brother Frank from
[2:27:04] Germany
[2:27:06] but they were all 15 in number.
[2:27:13] Uh, one of them was brother John who
[2:27:16] came from New York. Okay. From UK,
[2:27:20] Britain.
[2:27:24] That brother who came from Britain was
[2:27:26] speaking a word which I have not
[2:27:28] forgotten. [music]
[2:27:33] That was one short brother. He was
[2:27:35] having a boy. He was called Daniel.
[2:27:40] He also spoke is when message
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; among the 15
[2:27:50] what was brother John talking
[2:27:56] something concerning the message of the
[2:27:58] hour
[2:28:03] how it came to
[2:28:08] then When he looked into the place where
[2:28:11] he came from,
[2:28:16] he saw that UK,
[2:28:18] Great Britain has been overtaken by the
[2:28:21] riches of the world.
[2:28:28] He said they in their in their land
[2:28:34] all the time seeing money in front of
[2:28:37] you. People
[2:28:44] are committed to their personal work.
[2:28:48] But for one to come to the presence of
[2:28:50] God, it's very difficult. [music]
[2:28:56] He said God has given you this measure
[2:28:59] of the hour is so great and wonderful.
[2:29:03] The one you are gathering
[2:29:10] He said do not look like the people who
[2:29:13] are hunting for the wealth and the
[2:29:15] riches of the world. Why am I
[2:29:17] emphasizing on this?
[2:29:20] Pastor Simon who has been our preacher
[2:29:22] of the night
[2:29:25] that others are waiting for bishops,
[2:29:29] others are waiting for other big
[2:29:30] officials.
[2:29:32] He says that's not the way.
[2:29:35] Like for him,
[2:29:37] he's from New US.
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; I am not like those ones.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:47] It's better to show the reality of faith
[2:29:49] like that.
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:55] Love the message more than anything.
[2:29:59] Love the message.
[2:30:02] to brother
[2:30:05] is a great blessing
[2:30:10] to the region of Kamoa.
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:16] Even if the devil try to block the way
[2:30:21] God who prepared the message for you
[2:30:27] is rich of ways.
[2:30:30] Yes. his half
[2:30:34] that he will not forget
[2:30:39] was having a pride at
[2:30:45] the bride of Christ.
[2:30:48] The Lord will never leave his suffer.
[2:30:52] Even if a man can try to block his way,
[2:30:55] even a person try to block, let me
[2:30:58] assure you
[2:31:02] Even the devil is trying to fight the
[2:31:04] way of pastor in order to remove from
[2:31:07] them the med of this.
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; He's trying his best.
[2:31:13] We are aware. We know.
[2:31:16] But brother stand firm.
[2:31:21] Stand firm.
[2:31:23] Hallelujah.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:31] You are doing what the Bible is saying.
[2:31:35] If you give
[2:31:38] what you are giving is you are putting
[2:31:40] to the treasure in heaven.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; From the time you remember
[2:31:47] what what you are doing for is great.
[2:31:53] God will bless you
[2:31:56] and still desire. There's still a lot
[2:32:00] for you to do for
