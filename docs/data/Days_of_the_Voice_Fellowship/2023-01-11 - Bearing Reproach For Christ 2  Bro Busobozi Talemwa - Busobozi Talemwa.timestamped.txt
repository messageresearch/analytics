[1:09:53] if we stay long enough here
[1:10:02] but God is permitting it to happen
[1:10:06] not much will happen
[1:10:09] because there has to be that mystery
[1:10:13] which is only left for the Believers
[1:10:18] just picking things into existence
[1:10:25] can't do that science
[1:10:29] so let them reproach this message
[1:10:36] but as far as we are concerned
[1:10:39] we are the people of the South Poles
[1:10:44] hallelujah amen we are the people of the
[1:10:47] revelation of the world
[1:10:49] [Music]

[1:12:22] [Music]
[1:12:27] Matthew 7. Mateo is
[1:12:33] and before we read that verse 13 says
[1:12:34] you know man tried to seek honor one
[1:12:37] from another and they honor one another
[1:12:39] and dishonor God by doing so
[1:12:43] um
[1:12:43] foreign
[1:13:17] foreign
[1:13:44] [Music]
[1:13:58] you know let me tell you
[1:14:00] I'm about to finish they couldn't be
[1:14:02] married I realize I'm not going to push
[1:14:04] this message in one day or in two days
[1:14:08] as long as the Lord is still inspiring
[1:14:10] me on it
[1:14:13] when it comes to following
[1:14:18] Christo he says white is the girl
[1:14:21] agament
[1:14:23] and Broad is the way
[1:14:26] that leads to destruction
[1:14:31] whenever at any time you say
[1:14:34] [Music]
[1:14:36] but everybody else is doing it
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:15:04] which go in there
[1:15:08] [Music]
[1:15:10] when you take the broad way
[1:15:14] the criticism
[1:15:16] is not going to be much
[1:15:21] as a matter of fact
[1:15:23] you will not be reproached
[1:15:26] because you will feel even good you're
[1:15:28] in a group
[1:15:30] many times we preach to people they
[1:15:32] don't want to believe as individuals
[1:15:37] when you when if you meet a group of
[1:15:40] three four
[1:15:42] that's why for me when I'm evangelizing
[1:15:45] some of you evangelists can take a leave
[1:15:47] from this
[1:15:49] I always don't try to evangelize in a
[1:15:52] group
[1:15:56] when you evangelize
[1:15:59] many times you will not find one to
[1:16:02] believe
[1:16:04] because
[1:16:06] two hours of speaking
[1:16:10] who wants to believe
[1:16:16] baboon
[1:16:39] many people want to work in numbers
[1:17:00] that leads to destruction
[1:17:03] the gut is
[1:17:09] [Music]
[1:17:20] people will always break off from the
[1:17:24] first one and second pool
[1:17:32] when it comes to the sad pool
[1:17:35] it can only pull those ones who have a
[1:17:38] seed of God in them
[1:17:43] let me tell you
[1:17:45] those of us who believe this message
[1:17:49] there are many people who can stay in
[1:17:51] the message because of many reasons
[1:17:53] [Music]
[1:17:55] but I will tell you what if you are
[1:17:58] staying in this church
[1:18:04] because of the word you are here
[1:18:09] foreign
[1:18:54] [Music]
[1:19:10] for the sake of Christ for the sake of
[1:19:13] the review the word
[1:19:16] then I am sick
[1:19:18] and the devil can't convince me
[1:19:20] otherwise
[1:19:24] everything else that I need
[1:19:26] you promised to give them to me
[1:19:29] if he hasn't yet
[1:19:31] because he has delayed yeah
[1:19:36] always adjusting my face
[1:19:41] he has given them to me if he is not
[1:19:45] able to give them to me now
[1:19:48] I believe he'll give them to me tomorrow
[1:19:55] what is my sister's name
[1:19:58] is
[1:20:00] Fiona you see
[1:20:02] God Can Open Your Eyes

[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:14] while I was preaching just my mind came
[1:21:17] to you right now
[1:21:21] no matter what cause the eyes to lose
[1:21:23] sight seeing song
[1:21:26] it doesn't have to be either medical
[1:21:28] some even say whether it's witchcraft
[1:21:37] the thing is God Can Open the Eyes of
[1:21:41] the blind
[1:21:44] to the extent he has even given eyeballs
[1:21:49] to those who did not have them
[1:21:51] [Music]
[1:21:53] did you know that even those who didn't
[1:21:57] have eyeballs
[1:22:06] many times differently means so that God
[1:22:09] can do we know that but now when he does
[1:22:14] it I know something the course will say
[1:22:16] well if he has not done it now it means
[1:22:18] you have no not enough Faith
[1:22:24] might not even have anything to do with
[1:22:26] it
[1:22:28] it might but it might not have anything
[1:22:30] today
[1:22:34] but one thing I want to tell you today
[1:22:36] tonight
[1:22:39] if you believe the word of God
[1:22:49] is putting you to Christ
[1:22:54] if it's Miracles
[1:23:01] he came to Christ they received
[1:23:03] everything they wanted they went away
[1:23:04] but they were Christians
[1:23:06] but those
[1:23:08] who are predestinated to life
[1:23:14] Hallelujah man it's not the Miracles
[1:23:17] that sustained them
[1:23:21] Hallelujah
[1:23:23] I can remain blind all my life and still
[1:23:27] serve God Faithfully
[1:23:34] God is able to open my eyes
[1:23:38] and he can choose to open them anytime
[1:23:41] he Wills yes
[1:23:44] and sister believe he is still in the
[1:23:47] business of doing that
[1:23:51] never lose Faith at any time
[1:23:54] faith is not a feeling of a big muscle
[1:23:59] faith is believing what your God can do
[1:24:06] and when you believe it
[1:24:09] take your faith on that ground okay
