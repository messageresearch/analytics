Shall we bow our heads in our prayer? As the song I said, these words are ancient. [Music] But they are ever true and their purpose is to change you as to change me. Then he say we have come with open heart and let the ancient word impart because sound from God's own [Music] heart. Nothing can change a man save the word of God. That's why we have come this morning in the quietness of the Holy Spirit to have a talk with God. Talk to him. He talks back to our prophet told [Music] us. Our prophet told us and he say we come to this place. It has been ordained. to worship God, not to see each other. We can do it that outside or go to our home. We have to come here. Be quiet. Talk to God and he talks to us. Open our hearts to him. The Lord work on me. Touch me down. I'm heavy, Lord. Take off this Lord of this place where we come to be comforted as believers, as children of God. Father, we are thankful. David said, "I will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart." Lord, we are not worthy, but we believe that our sins have been all washed away, cast in the sea of God's forgiveness. Wash me in the blood of the lamb, the Lord God Almighty. You can minister to us. Take the flesh aside. Anoint and inspire us. Father, we are insufficient. We don't know how to breathe this word. Ourselves. We are men and women [Music] of wrongs here and there. But like David say heart right. May our inner mind may the inner mind be renewed and refreshed this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus our Lord and Savior. The Lord Jesus Christ. We have done it. We bless your name. We commit a service into your hand. Amen. [Music] Amen. Amen. God richly bless you. We thank God that we are again the Lord fell fell. [Music] It fell that way and uh you can't be used to standing here. You'll never get used if you really want to be sincere. Amen. Let us read from the book of Philippians chapter 4. Verse 413. Just open your hearts. We are just going to have a little talk. It is 11:30. Right. Yes. Um Philippians 4 chapter Philippians 4:43. We have a visitor here who hasn't mentioned fromala. [Music] Please wave to us. God rich bless you sir. You're most welcome feel at home. May you be blessed by the words and we look forward to seeing again and again and again and again and again. Amen. The Bible says, "Rejoice in the Lord always." And again, I say, "Rejoice." Let us move together. Yeah. Rejoice in the Lord only. And again, I say rejoice. [Music] Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. Be careful for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. Those things which you have both learned and received. Listen carefully. Those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me, do and the God of peace shall be with you. But I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at last your care of me has flourished again wherein were also careful but lacked the opportunity. [Music] Not that I speak in respect of want. Not that I speak in respect of want. For I have learned in whatever state I am, therewith to be [Music] content, I know both how to be a best and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer. [Music] [Music] [Music] I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me. Amen. Father, add a blessing to the reading of your word. Send thy spirit of wisdom. Divide it to your people. Let it give them the life of Christ. Have your way. We know you are here. May we be cautious of that. We pray father humbly weak in the name of our lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Carefully take your seats. Amen. Before I go for further uh I want to read this again in the New Living Translation also. Brother, you may not interpret. Amen. Always be full of joy in the Lord. I say it again. Rejoice. Let everyone see that you are considerate in all you do. Remember the Lord is coming soon. Don't worry about anything. Instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need and thank him for all he has done. Then you will experience God's peace which exceeds anything you can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus. And now, dear brothers and sisters, one final thing. Fix your thoughts on what is true and honorable and right and pure and lovely and admirable. Think about the things that are excellent and worthy of praise. Keep putting into practice all you learned and received from me. Everything you heard from me and saw me doing. Then the God of peace will be with you. How I praise the Lord that you are concerned about me again. I know you have always been concerned for me, but you didn't have the chance to help me. Not that I was ever in need, for I have learned how to be content with whatever I have. I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything. I have learned the secret of living in every situation, whether it is with a full stomach or empty, with plenty or little, for I can do everything through Christ who gives me strength. Amen. I want to talk about contentment just to talk about contentment. Amen. Contentment is a freedom from worry and frustrations about unfulfilled desires in life. You are stable. You are not shaken. You are not moved. No heartaches. Not pressured up. But in this neurotic age that we in any times that we are living in the end time conditions the Bible says perplexity of times men's heart failing for fear. We said be filled with the spirit. Your alarm streamed and clear the end time conditions and conditions of trouble, the conditions of perplexity, hardiness in life, a lot of struggles. It is hard to live. It is hard for a man to catch something and live by it and freely possess something. So the condition that we're living in today, it says the love of many shall grow cold, there shall be no contentment, no freedom, no liberty. and coming to Christ, coming to the church, confessing, thank God I am free from this world of sin but seriously not free because you lack something. We are talking about contentment in this age that you are living in. It's a lukewarm generation. Part in the world in Christ believe not a believer but we don't want to be that we want to be real solid Christian Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary pure and holy tried and true. We do not want to be a step in the Lord a step outside. We want to be Christians, genuine Christians. That's what we are longing for. Contentment. You find people are not contented in this age about their gender. Men want to be women. They would have a plastic surgery and become a woman. But you will still remain a man by the hormones. Try to change that because they are not contacted with their gender. Women want to be men because they lack contentment for who they are, what God made them to be. But you have got a commission. And the only way to fulfill that commission love what you are in this age. We have got the people and not contented about their nationality. They do not feel proud to be called a Uganda pleased God. So they would rather run away got some other country. They changed their national authority. Not because they are sent by God, but because they were not contained to be what God made to be Ugandans or whatever nationality that God gave them. The people not content about their race. Well, we say the the black people want to be white. They are not content. Something was planted in their heart. Make them believe that being black is undeserving. And now that same thing If it is a spirit, it deceives the white man too. It is a spirit. So the people not contented about their [Music] race. They would rather preach and become brown. But they become ugly. They look terrible. The knees are black. The lips are black. You are destroying your soul. There is no contentment about their body size. I've seen twice of these. One was thin. She was a sister. Ever not contented. I'm too thin. I should eat pork of fats. The fats of pork [Music] at I'm not happy happy. I'm not pleased. I've had brothers. I've heard brothers not like sisters. There is a brother for you. that likes many sisters. There is that brother. There is a sister also naturally fat young girl naturally fat in high school. is a big brother. Big brother, I'm so faded. I want to cut you every day troubled me at school. But you are beautiful and you say brothers don't like that brothers like that. But the people are not content. They will go for plastic surgery, put on fake bombs whatsoever to look what they are not because they content. You find the people are not content about their stature. Because they are short. They feel no sister. The shorty brother. There is a sister here. He loves a shorty brother. Brother said this is too tall. I don't want a tower. Brother, there is a sister here. What I'm trying to get you conviction, what you are truly is the perfect what you ought to be. They are not contented about their tribe. You a Christian now. But God chose you a certain tribe. Every tribe those people have got a certain way they look. different from others. Their accent, some of them is too bad. Are you that word is not like you're speaking it badly, but it is the accent. Don't make him uncomfort. Don't start to feel discontented. Just be proud of that. We find children. They're not contented about their parents, they reach an extent. When the parents, pick them and take them to schools of rich people a bit, the parent struggles, give them the best. When they reach there now the video comes with other parents we come driving and and now they see her. Mommy's going to come walking. I'm finished. I'm going to be ashamed. She's coming with a basket with a food flask. with flight that easy. She's not even going to give me pocket money and they feel ashamed. They tend to shine away. They come but they don't feel comforted. You are not that you accept what you are. There was a little girl talked about this. The mother took her to school. But when she reached that school, she got influenced by the friend. You know the friend talking about what they talk, what they share. The time came they had to go back home. While they were in the bus going home towards the station, this other friend of hers looked and saw an ugly looking woman. She said, "Oh, isn't she awful? Ugly. She looks terrible. My my my but that was the mother of the friend reaching the station. This young lady because of the words of the friend. She felt so discouraged, so discontented, uncomfortable. And when she came out, she was passing the mother. The mother came out. He said, "Leave me alone. I don't know." There was a tax conductor there. He said, "I know this girl and I know the mother and I know the story. Someday the mother was washing clothes and she went out from the top of the floor there. No. She came down to hang the crosses. To hang the crosses. While she was down, fire got up the other side where the baby was. The mother took a veil herself and entered through the fire and picked the baby. But now to come out, one of them had to lose the other and she got the ve it around the baby and went through the fire and it build off a beautiful face. He said, "You girl, you don't know. It's not so beautiful for you to look beautiful." And the prophet says, "That's how we look." And the Lord Jesus, we get ashamed of him, despised, afflicted. But he was despised for your sake. He was ashamed for your sake. Don't be discouraged about that. So the people they get to that point is contented troubled about useless things very useless. Discontentment draws many people into covetousness. In Exodus 27, the Bible says, "Covert not thy neighbor's house, Covert not thy neighbor's house or your neighbor's ass, all the man's servants, all his possessions. not but discontentment brings about and some people they think that having plenty takes away they think that having plenty brings contentment but it cannot do it. The king deputy had many wives all over the palace. He could get any virgin that he desired and he wasn't guilty. But he took one that had only one king had many. I expect him to be contented. I expect him to be contented. But he was not contented. He converted his neighbor's wife. And God sent him a prophet and he gave him a proverb and he realized that he had sinned. Lack of contentment leads many to sin. See look how this king looks over at that woman. Who is this woman? He didn't care to me and he took her discontented, dissatisfaction leading into sin. The king was a king in Israel. He had a lot riches and honor, wealth. He could get the money that he land that he wanted. But he saw his vineard and he desired him and refused to give it to him because it was his inheritance. The king was so troubled. He got so displeased. He converted. He murdered the man and he took his fight. He was discontented. Contentment. The devil was the first creature without contentment. Perfect in beauty. Shall be that covers above all angels full of wisdom. If the tumbles are saying well but he was not content that led him to disobey. He was not contented with what God had made. He instead wanted to be like God. discontentment. Brother, sister, a lot of people live a worldly life, worldly life, full of frustrations. They have ambitions. They have set goals that gets them into disappointment. because they have not been fruitful. You have got to have desires like any other human being. And any wise thinking man has got to have ambitions. You set your ambitions when you are young. But yet in the midst of all these things, we must never forget in Proverbs 16:9, the Bible says, "A man's heart devises his way, but the Lord directs his step. Contentment is positivity. It is positivity. appreciating what you have rather than focusing on what you don't have. Contentment is positivity. Appreciating what you have rather than focusing on what you don't have and to worry about it. Don't you ever be too blinded by worry to the extent that you can't see what God has done and what he is doing for you. There is what he has done. But there is what he's doing. Brother Bram says whenever something is happening down here, there is something happening up in heaven. Count your blessings. Name them one by one. Count your blessings. See what God has done. Hallelujah. God wants you to see and give him glory and give him praise. Contentment doesn't take away ambition. It doesn't take away desperation. It is simply an inner sufficiency that keeps us at [Music] peace in spite of outward [Music] circumstances. Contentment isn't complency. Contentment can exist together with ambition. Exactly. Contentment can exist with growth. with growth. As long as you are satisfied with your current [Music] state while striving for more contentment is not complacency. Complency implies a lack of [Music] effort. [Music] Exactly. A lack of effort on desire to improve. You are not contented. You are complacent. Compulsive people not awareness. They are resistant to [Music] change. They lack motivation. They lack inspiration. They lack wisdom. Come to the Lord. He gives you wisdom. Contentment is not complacency. complacent people become stagnant miss opportunities. Never deceive yourself and you you are in complenced but in sin in sin. You are just complacent in poverty or you are there in need or in sickness. Contentment as can't doesn't take away desire for growth of change. Complacent people are not contented. They are actually defeated and selfentered. Contentment isn't a natural virtue. The people have a saying that I was created because they can be patient, a little quiet and silent. They humble like that but like it is my nature nature given virtues cannot stand the test of time. Wait. When the test comes, God will bring a test to prove to you that your nature given virtues can not stand the test of time. It is a self righteousness. And God doesn't like us. Self integrity. I know myself. I know myself. I know myself. God will prove to you weak contentment isn't natural [Music] virtue like that. You are lying to us. You have to learn it. Contentment is learned. And learning is by experience. Philippians chapter 4 verse 11 he says not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned in whatever state I am with to be content. I have learned it. It is experiences. It says I know how to appear best. I know how to abound everywhere and in all things. I am instructed. I am instructed. I am instructed. Who is this instructing him? It is the Lord both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and suffer. [Music] So you see here it is a thought it is only thought it is experience and look what he says he doesn't say and I'm like that he says I can do it only through If your contentment is controlled by earthly outward material things, you will never be contented all the days of your life. You will always be miserable. Sorrowful contentment comes from within and it is a virtue of the Holy Ghost. 1 Timothy chapter 6 verse three says if any man teach other otherwise and consent not to follow some words even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ unto the doctrine which is according to godliness he is proud Okay. Knowing nothing but doubting about questions and stripes of words. Where of cometh envings? [Music] disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth. Supposing that gain is godliness, from such withdraw thyself. [Music] But godliness with contentment is a great gain. We brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can we can carry nothing out and having food and raignment. Let us be there with content. But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and pition. Now listen, money is not bad. Riches is not bad. what he says for the love of money. Money is not bad. It is only bad in the hands of a bad man. For the love of money, is the root of all evil which some converted after. They have errored from the faith and pierced themselves through with many [Music] sorrows. But thou, oh man of God, the things If you follow after righteous, godliness, faith, love, patience, sickness, fight the good fight of hold on eternal life until thou also called. Brother, contentment does not come from outward things or how much you have. Believest thou this 1951, the prophet says when he called his disciples, he never went and got the educated priest out of the seminary. He went down on the river. and go fishermen and go business, poor people that they would have nothing. They would have nothing that the world would say. Why? Yes, they became great men because they had a great [Music] background. They had no background at all. And he just picked them out like a jewels out of the dirt and he made their names [Music] immortal. God picks the people and he makes them immortal. He picks little Joel and turns them to beauty. Peter, James, John and so forth. Fishermen of lowly pant type people. I'm so glad that God still deals with poor people and common people. The scripture says to the poor that is in the heart. The gospel is preached. But again he's saying the common people had him gladly. The gospel is simple. God in simplicity, hiding himself in simplicity, revealing himself in the same. Brother, every time we get to think that God is is something great like mysterious search and search and search and pass him. It is in simplicity that we know God. For we don't have much of this world is good. We don't desire this world is good. Put your soul on things [Music] eternal. Hold God's unchanging [Applause] hand. If there is anything that we ought not to desire, is it too much of this thing? I aim higher each day. I work hard to go higher and I love to become great and rich. But I am content just enough to live by. That's all the prophet says. what you have. It may look too much, but it matches exactly. Look, look, look. What you have may look too much or too little, but it matches exactly with your current responsibilities. [Music] Sure. Sufficiency. Someone may have 100 million. And it is sufficient. Have 1 million and it is sufficient. It depends on the responsibility that the Lord has given. But The poorest of Christians must at least have food and clothing because having food enjoyment let us be content. So without food in the house, without clothing, I may God give you that poor you are ought to have that and God can provide it. The prophet says, "If I would probably taken the money that had been offered [Music] me, I would be an independent rich man. But today, as far as I know, I own this already truck out here about six years old, but for me it works for What am I trying to show you here? He needed not that he was rich. It was just sufficient. He said out here about six years old. Then listen and ach. Now listen what it is for. What he uses it for that I take my wife along in when I take her. this he had it for three years. He says that if I want to move with my wife to just drive her around, I bring the Pontia. But for you, even the you don't have it. Me, it works. It means if you need a certain to drive your wife around, God can give it. It is a need, not luxury, a need to him. I love the message. The prophet says, "I was born in a poor little but but by and by it was not in a little cabin anymore. It was now a nice house. Then he says, "I drive this old maybe my sons will drive some maybe." You see, he was contented but with ambitious. Contented but aiming higher. Contented but believingly promised. Oh, hallelujah. He says and the crosses that we have, what we have at home, that's all we own. That's right. Everything that we have. But I would rather live like that and have favor with God than the best than to have the best movie star home there. That's right. rather feel in my heart feeling the presence of Christ that I feel now than to have the riches of this world. I love him. He is wonderful. And he came to this world as my example as your example to just be content with such as we have. I would rather have Jesus than all these worldly things. True happiness comes from contentment because here we have no continuence. But we seek one to come. We are pilgrims and strangers wandering through this world of sin. The prophet says 1950 1950 here we have no continuing and listen happiness does not consist of how much of the world's goods you [Music] own but how contented you are with the portion allotted to Who all lots that portion? God allots that portion. I remember the prophet of God looked over and he saw the riches of Oral Roberts all that they had and say Lord you can't trust me things. I have a little small office. just there as he was still there. The Lord said, "I am your portion." Hallelujah. The heart the the the art of being happy. It lies in the power of extracting happiness. You extract happiness from common things within your [Music] means. Extract happiness from them. After all, it is the Lord that has given you even the little that you have. Contentment makes rich men poor. Discontentment makes rich men poor. Contentment makes poor content. It is the condition of the heart. That's all that matters. Discontented people are always trying to be something they are [Music] [Music] not. The wife lays burdens upon the husband. Husband lays burdens upon the wife. sure they know it's beyond their means. If you fail to trust God and pull and push each other don't do [Music] sedent to say I think this sister was not meant for me. I think I made a mistake. He doesn't want to go back home. You find him eating meat on the road. I can buy meat on the road and eat and eat my meat on the road. brother to buy and you walking it and my wife has not tasted it. It's not good. So she will say I think this is my husband the sister will start to say I wish God gave me a man like He's a beautiful man. He speak his voice is bad. Things happen when someone is not contented contented about their marriage. Contented about their marriage. I heard the sister was complaining about the brother complain about this and that until they separated not contented. The Bible says when I became a man things but when children get married they do childish things be mature. Be contented. Not contented. in the church. Not contented, not contented about the pastor, about the minister, about the brothers and sisters in the church, not comfortable, with the company of believers. You are not contented. Something is wrong. Brother, sister, be contented to be a wife and remain in your place. Husband, brother, be contented to be a father. Keep the children, no matter how many they are, listen. children. Many children don't make a money poor. They make a money rich. Listen, you can win your child to Christ. But you won't take the possessions of the world. That's far greater than the riches of man. Children don't make a money poor. They don't make a family crippled. They are a blessing. David says, [Applause] David says, "He that has many, they are like crowns." Amen. Brother, sister, be contented with your calling, knowing this that each one of us has been called with a higher calling. Simply aim higher to be the best version of yourself. Aim higher to be the best wife, your best husband, the best preacher, leader. Whenever of yourself, compete with yourself. [Music] compete with yourself until you get to the higher calling the mark of the high calling in your calling. A Christian we can worry we can complain as human beings but there is no just reason. to worry and complain though we know it is not just reason simply put God first seek God first and his righteousness then all these other things shall be added to you listen brother the Bible says says that the the Gentiles or people were not in Christ seek after these things. But behold the flowers of the field. Solomon was rich. Yet he was not dressed like one of them. The Lord trusted them. I remember my first preaching on a church par on a Sunday I was a poor boy then those days when I was young also I'm just a student like that I had just reason but it does not matter make any sense so I had no shirt to put on shirt long sleeve I didn't I didn't have any tie. You know, I went down and I prayed. I said, "God, I read it somewhere in the Bible where you told Moses, make garments for Aaron, for glory and for beauty." I said, "Lord, I need a sh for glory and for beauty. That night at 11, that night at 11, there's a neighbor came, a woman, help me, come help me do something, I went and he did that work. Brother, she paid me with money. The next time I got a job construction cuz I did those things, water engineering. So I did that. I got my money. I went and I bought a nice shirt. The brother gave me a [Music] nice look. Now look, it is common, very simple. It is simple. But it gave me happiness. Brother, he says the flowers the Lord dresses them of the field do not s but they are vested. It says, "Are you not much better than Let me tell you, it says Hebrews 13:5-6, let your conversation be without covetousness, and be content with such things as ye have, for he has said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." Hebrews 13:5 [Music] withh for he has said, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." [Music] So that we may boldly say, "The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. [Music] Just being content. God has made a promise. I'll never be norain. The cure of sin and envy is to find our contentment in [Music] God. Rejoice with those that rejoice but we don't do it because we feel what they have got or we we ought to have it too. But the scripture says in his time he has made all things beautiful in his time. Just be contented. If a man is going to be a street sweeper, He should sweep streets even as Michael Angel [Music] painted as Michael [Music] Angel as Shakespeare wrote a [Music] poet. He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause and say here lived a great street sweeper who did his job so well. I don't know what is your [Music] job. I don't know what is your job. But perhaps you can't do what I do. I can't do what you do. Do your job. So well you are the only one that can do it. So don't struggle to be like someone else. struggle to be the best version of Christian contentment. Christian contentment is having no higher [Music] ambition than it to belong to the [Music] Lord and to be entirely at his disposal. just exposed to the Lord entirely at the disposal of the Lord. What would thou have me do? Here I am. Spread out your petition before God. And then say, "Thy will not mind." The sweetest lesson I've learned is God is a school to let the Lord choose for me. Look, brother, Philippians 4:6 says, "Be careful for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving. Let your requests be made known unto God with prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving. Let your request be made known unto God. There's a song we sing says all because we do not [Music] carry. We don't take all things to God in prayer. Then he says, "And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and mind through Christ." God God wants you to walk moment by moment, moment by moment, depending on the Holy Spirit. That's why we sing that song one day at a time. Sweet Jesus. That's all I'm asking for. Help me today to do every day. What you love me to one day at a time. Yesterday's gone. Tomorrow may never be mine. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. For the moral will take care of [Music] itself. We need it. The people say, if I had a little more, brother, I should be very satisfied. And you make a mistake with us. If you're not content, with what you have. You would not be satisfied if it was doubled. Remember, he that is faithful in little things shall be given over big [Music] things. We need it. If I had some more of this, of that, I will be satisfied. I'll be content. You have got to do it [Music] now. Show proof that you are glad to the Lord. I remember Napoleon the great Alexander Napoleon was such a great conqueror. He conquered the world. He conquered many nations the prophet says he reached a point conquered the entire world and he looked there was no more place to conquer. and he wept because there was no more place to conquer. No matter how great a conqueror he was, he still was not content because contentment is a Christian virtue. Alex is under the great how great a rich man he was. How great a conqueror he was. But the territory is hard. He died miserable because of discontentment. But he learned a lesson that I can carry nothing out of this world. Neither does there anything that can save a man from the chains of death. But I'm so glad this morning that the sting of death, the Lord Jesus Christ set us free. And we are glad today. I am contented. Let death come. I am contented. Because he lives. I confess tomorrow. And because I know he holds the future in the message Africa trip report the prophet was there. Remember he had gone out of the will of God willfully knowing he was drove into it. He got into a fix and God gave him a permissive will. But God said you will suffer and he got an amba from there. Went back home for over six months sick and down and crawling because he went out of the will of God and praying and repenting weeping and calling upon the Lord. Then he started to think about the future. He said, "I wonder what is the future holding for me? Is this my end? I don't know. I'm so He was meditating. I don't know what really the future holds as he was still meditating. You know, it's good to meditate upon the things of God. Then the angel of the Lord came in a vision and he said, "In as much as you are meditating about your future, the future is clear. Hallelujah. The future is clear. The waters are clear. about how far we go, how long we stay here, everything is clear. The children of Israel when they were in the wilderness, they really failed to see God what he was doing. They failed to see it. They were not contented with the mana. They were not contented with the water from the rock. And that blinded them to see what God was doing. It happens to people today. This contentment in most of the things of life, we don't have to be that way. We ought to learn to be contented. Discontented about spiritual gifts. discontented about ministries you but just have to be contented about the portion that God has allotted to you because God knows what exactly fits you I'm done now we can stand on our feet that the people don't enjoy to be contented because they think being contented is being weak. But it is strength. Brothers and sisters, in this simplicity, learn to trust God. Depend upon his word. Always be thankful. I come to God with thanksgiving knowing and believing that your life is in God's hand and nothing will ever get out of place. Whatever God has prepared for you, you will have it. You will have it. Amen. I'm done with this. You know the word of God, just something small from the word of God is enough. [Music] [Music] Mess is a yes. This holy [Music] Burn me. Oh my god. [Music] Now what [Music] is my sonior? [Music] Glory to God who gave I [Music] see [Music] is my son. [Music] Give [Music] us watching. [Music] single tool. [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] go and No [Music] might all one of one become. [Music] Almost never [Music] [Music] Z no [Music] for good. [Music] There is. Yes. Yes. Holy one of the God. [Music] Oh, God. You [Music] Hallelujah. This quietness I know that the presence of God is here as human beings a lot of works things pressing us here and there but you can lay it down. You can ask God. We sing a song which says I must tell Jesus all my worries and all my sorrows and burdens will I not feel his presence but he is [Music] here because he said after all he said he with prayer and supplication. Just make your request known to God. Thanksgiving this afternoon. If you have a need, maybe you are sick. It has given you this comfort. It is true. It's really troubles. I know what it is to be sick in the body and something for long. I know what it is. But the Bible says it's only Jesus that is the charge of the fear. He knows to help those who are tempted. made me temptations down in the Lord of you have come in the presence of God. You have come in the house of God in his word. Talk to him now. Say Lord Jesus. Here I am. Help me father. Give me contentment. Teach me Lord to wait down on my knees. in your own good time. You answer my pray to rely on what others wait in prayer for an answer from you. Lord Jesus Christ of the word. We believe that you are true. Believe in your saving grace. [Music] Thank you for your truth. Thank you for your grace. [Music] Father provide Lord this day with them father. Give them joy and happiness. The joy of your salvation. You can do it now Lord as you have always done it. I said yesterday I forever maybe there is a s here that is so uncomfortable sin has taken hold of them let them know let them understand that your grace is sufficient they be so convicted without an invitation let the holy spirit convict their hearts I bring them to the [Music] timeless need of the Holy Spirit. They are so uncomfortable. Maybe it is a family. Children have no school. Whatever it may be, thou knowest. You promised to supply all our needs according to your riches. Father, we thank you for your time. We praise your name. Thank you for what you've given us. We thank you for we are what you have made us and we are looking at you to lift us and raise us. Bless your people, Lord. Keep them in your presence with us Lord as we leave this place with us in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. As brother Martin comes to give us whatever he has to give [Music] us. [Music] Holy Jesus I want to see Holy belief. [Music] Thank [Music] you. Lord, I receive. Lord, I receive. [Music] Lord, I receive. [Music] All things are for [Music] I receive. [Music] Lord, I [Music] receive all things that [Music] you Lord I [Music] see to come. [Music] [Music] to go through the river to [Music] come to the river. [Music] me to come close me to before we close the word of prayer just thank the Lord for speaking to I just want us to remember our student who are going back to school. [Music] Yeah, I know the schools are open officially tomorrow. So, we have the little ones and those in high schools. I've also learned of others who have already [Music] reported. Yeah. Shall we pray? Precious Lord Jesus, Father, we thank you for your love that you have bestow toward us Lord. We are here Lord Jesus just as attributes of your love. And Lord, we know how that love compelled you in the beginning and you came down and redeemed us. Father God, we're remembering our children who have gone back to school and those will be going or others are leaving today and others tomorrow. We dedicate them at your hands. We know we are sending them father amid billions of demons. We've seen others battling with uh battling with habits and we know there a lot of things happening in school today and here we are bringing our children. We ask you that Lord you cover them with the blood of Jesus. It's our prayer that you blind them from the things of the world and you'll always capture their hearts Lord and every day will prepare their heart to receive from you. Pray for each father, for all the parents who are here that God you'll meet their needs. Lord, you provide us with fees for our children and other needs. Lord Jesus, precious father, king of kings. We thank you for the vessel you have used this day. We ask you that you refresh him, Lord. You continue anointing him, Lord. Bless our interpreting brother. We ask that Lord the Holy Spirit will refresh him. Lord, you told us not only be the hearers of the word, the doers of the word and one thing we know Lord Jesus. We cannot do without you Lord. But you gave us a promise in your word that when he the Holy Ghost is come, you will quicken father our mortal bodies. Precious father, you will teach us, will lead us to all things. May that spirit quicken each one of us to believe every word and to act upon it Lord Jesus that father all our children will be concerned about what they have heard. Lord, may you help us to be contented with what you have given us, putting you as our example because we know that thou, Lord Jesus, you are the mark of the holy calling. As we believe in this place, Lord Jesus, may you go with each one of us, Lord. May the pillar of fire divide himself among us as Lord. We pray for our pastor where he is Lord that your grace will continue using him. May you lead him father. Use him in the mighty way and we believe that Lord you are using him [Music] already. Remember his family Lord Jesus. May you bless them. King of glory. You bless each one of us. Lord, the ministers of this church, the late Lord Jesus, our families, Jehovah God. May you fight our battles. Father, we bless your loving name. We turn the glory and honor to you in the most precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ. remember our overnight Lord Jesus. May you prepare us Lord in Christ Jesus we pray. Amen. May the Lord bless you so much. We've come to the end of our service. Just want to bring to your attention our Friday overnight. kindly let us come in big number. I remember the first overnight the whole church was packed. And just imagine we have one in a month. So let's sacrifice and come. Uh the word of God tells us that you should seek him while he's still near. And somewhere he says because I called you and did it not answer me.
