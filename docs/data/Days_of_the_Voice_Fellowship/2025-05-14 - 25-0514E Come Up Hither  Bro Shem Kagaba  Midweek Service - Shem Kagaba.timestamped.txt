[51:29] Jesus. Amen.
[51:32] Maybe before you sit, we can go straight
[51:34] to the
[51:41] word. You open the book of Revelation
[51:44] chapter
[51:49] 4, just the two
[51:59] verses. Are we all there?
[52:05] says, "After this, I looked, and behold,
[52:07] a door was open in
[52:10] heaven." And
[52:12] uh and the first voice which I heard was
[52:16] as it it were of a trumpet talking with
[52:19] me, which said, "Come up hither, and I
[52:23] will show thee things which must be
[52:26] hereafter." And immediately I was in the
[52:29] spirit, and behold, the throne was sat
[52:31] in heaven, and one sat on the throne.
[52:40] [Music]
[52:59] [Music]
[53:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may be
[53:21] seated.
[53:27] You'll forgive me. My voice is not that
[53:30] good as usual.
[53:37] But I believe God is here still.
[53:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[53:44] I'm happy to see each and every one of
[53:46] you.
[53:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We thank God
[53:53] that we still have life and we are still
[53:55] serving
[53:58] him. Amen. So I will title my subject
[54:03] tonight. Come up
[54:08] hither. Hallelujah.
[54:11] Uh the scripture that we have
[54:13] read, the prophet refers to it many
[54:18] times and he always
[54:21] uh refers to it as uh the going out of
[54:24] the
[54:29] church. The going out of the church, the
[54:32] church going
[54:34] up. Hallelujah. And we all know that
[54:36] John was a type of of the bride.
[54:42] You are represented by John there.
[54:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I would like you
[54:49] to pray with
[54:50] me what the Lord has given me to come
[54:54] out because receiving an inspiration is
[54:57] another thing and also bringing it
[55:02] up. Hallelujah. And now we see this uh
[55:07] chapter that we have read
[55:09] Before this
[55:12] chapter there is chapter three.
[55:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now we see
[55:19] that chapter three talks about the
[55:24] condition of our
[55:27] age.
[55:28] Hallelujah. And then the prophet came he
[55:30] preached chapter one chapter 2 chapter
[55:32] 3.
[55:36] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And then and
[55:37] then we see
[55:39] here John
[55:43] saying that there was a door
[55:48] opening. But you remember in chapter
[55:50] three the door was
[55:52] closed and Jesus is closed
[55:56] outside. He's trying to knock to enter
[56:00] in. And now we can
[56:04] say that he was locked outside
[56:09] denomination. But as we are going to see
[56:14] uh the this book is the book of
[56:17] [Music]
[56:18] prophecy
[56:20] and there it's
[56:24] layered. It is in layers.
[56:29] You can open the first
[56:32] layer and you find dos and
[56:37] don'ts, how to be a good
[56:39] Christian. But again, you can read
[56:42] it and you find out it is talking about
[56:48] God, the deed of Jesus Christ.
[56:52] And then again you read it, you find it
[56:55] is talking about you.
[56:58] And then again you read it another
[57:02] layer you find that he's talking about
[57:05] the masterpiece Jesus Christ and the
[57:10] bride. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So this
[57:13] book is a book of
[57:15] prophecy. So Jesus was
[57:20] outside and we we can easily say he's
[57:23] outside the denomination.
[57:28] But as we going to see as we go
[57:31] on, Jesus Christ is outside of each
[57:35] one's
[57:39] heart as far as
[57:42] concerned. But I have good news for you
[57:46] this that John looked after this after
[57:52] what? After revelation chapter
[57:55] 3, he said that I looked and behold
[57:59] there was
[58:01] a open in
[58:03] heaven. Hallelujah. And then the prophet
[58:06] comes and
[58:07] says that chapter 4 is the only solution
[58:10] for chapter
[58:14] 3. The only solution that we have
[58:18] for Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now when
[58:22] you look at chapter four, there are very
[58:24] many things in
[58:27] there, but I will not talk about all of
[58:32] them. I just pick a few, I believe, like
[58:35] four
[58:35] [Music]
[58:37] verses. And if you want more, you can go
[58:39] also read the series that the prophet
[58:42] preached about Revelation 4.
[58:50] I believe we get more than
[58:52] that. And now let's first go a little
[58:54] bit back in chapter three.
[58:58] What is there
[59:02] chap verse 17 says that because thou
[59:04] sayest I am rich and increased with
[59:06] goods
[59:09] and have and have need of nothing and
[59:11] know not that thou at miserable and poor
[59:16] and blind and naked.
[59:20] [Music]
[59:35] And then he said that I counel thee to
[59:36] buy of me gold tried in the
[59:39] fire that thou mayest be riched rich and
[59:42] white remnant that thou mayest be
[59:45] clothed and that the ashame of thy
[59:47] nakedness. Do not
[59:49] appear and anoint thine eyes with
[59:52] thyelves that thou may see.
[59:57] [Music]
[1:00:14] As many as I love, I rebuke and just be
[1:00:17] zealous therefore and
[1:00:23] repent. Behold, I stand at the door and
[1:00:26] knock. If any man hear my voice and open
[1:00:30] the door, I will come in to sap and sap
[1:00:35] with him and he with me.
[1:00:39] [Music]
[1:00:49] And you see when you read about the all
[1:00:52] church
[1:00:55] ages, you will see that it's only when
[1:00:59] the angel say that be zealous and
[1:01:05] repent. Why? Because he saw that this
[1:01:09] age most all the people will lose their
[1:01:12] zeal.
[1:01:17] and they will lose the zeal of God, the
[1:01:20] zeal of the word of
[1:01:23] God. But the angel is saying that be
[1:01:27] zealous and
[1:01:29] repent.
[1:01:31] Hallelujah. So and and then when you got
[1:01:33] the message masterpiece, I
[1:01:36] know if you have ever read
[1:01:39] it, the prophet say that now the bride
[1:01:42] is smitten out of our neck.
[1:01:48] She is smitten to enter where into
[1:01:50] revelation
[1:01:54] 4 as we are going to see that revelation
[1:01:57] chapter
[1:01:59] 4 it was again typed in I believe is it
[1:02:09] exodus no I think it's numbers
[1:02:12] which numbers I believe chapter
[1:02:15] 2, Exodus chapter
[1:02:19] 25 and Numbers chapter
[1:02:22] 2. Hallelujah. We're going to see now
[1:02:26] and by God's
[1:02:28] grace. I want us to reduce this
[1:02:31] revelation
[1:02:34] 4. I want us to reduce this revelation
[1:02:40] 4 like to to the door of an individual
[1:02:49] here. Hallelujah.
[1:02:52] So the prophet say that uh the bread is
[1:02:58] eaten and then he said that the church
[1:03:00] goes
[1:03:02] up and then he said that the solution
[1:03:04] forian
[1:03:07] condition. It is the church to go
[1:03:10] up through that door that is
[1:03:14] open and of course you cannot fly high
[1:03:18] and you go through that open door.
[1:03:22] when you're not an eagle.
[1:03:25] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:03:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:30] So we see
[1:03:33] here that uh the reason why here the
[1:03:36] angel cried out that be
[1:03:41] zealous and
[1:03:43] repent. We see also in the book of
[1:03:46] Romans Paul talks about
[1:03:50] that to be cannally
[1:03:53] minded is death. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:03:57] So to be cannal
[1:03:59] minded, you can easily interpret
[1:04:03] it like thinking
[1:04:06] evil, thinking about
[1:04:08] immorality and all that.
[1:04:12] But being Canada
[1:04:15] minded, it means just being minded about
[1:04:18] the natural
[1:04:23] things,
[1:04:25] business,
[1:04:26] food,
[1:04:27] [Music]
[1:04:29] family, your
[1:04:33] errands and so
[1:04:35] forth. Those are kind of
[1:04:39] things, not immorality.
[1:04:43] Hallelujah. So Paul say that to be
[1:04:48] mind it is death.
[1:04:52] Okay.
[1:04:53] Now I want us to to put denominations
[1:04:59] aside. We are talking about the
[1:05:03] bride. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:05:06] Because as we are going to see that
[1:05:08] Lucifer when he started b the battle in
[1:05:10] heaven
[1:05:13] His ambition has never
[1:05:16] changed and his ambition is always
[1:05:19] closed where God
[1:05:23] is. He is not in the bars in
[1:05:26] the in
[1:05:29] the wrong places for
[1:05:33] him. They are wrong places for him.
[1:05:37] Count him there.
[1:05:41] only what he does. He's always at the
[1:05:43] source where the life
[1:05:47] is. Now the devil is not there but he's
[1:05:50] here in the
[1:05:53] message. Hallelujah. And that's
[1:05:56] why the seals were
[1:05:58] open for the
[1:06:01] bride because the Bible said Jesus said
[1:06:04] that it will be
[1:06:08] closed that he could even deceive the
[1:06:14] evil. And remember the prophet
[1:06:18] said that Pentecostal
[1:06:21] or Protestants open the cost.
[1:06:25] Pentecostal they are going to be worse
[1:06:28] than the Catholics.
[1:06:32] So you don't you don't think that
[1:06:36] Pentecostals and all these denominations
[1:06:37] that they will deceive the bride.
[1:06:42] Not the denomination that will receive
[1:06:43] the will deceive the
[1:06:47] bride because Jesus said that it is very
[1:06:51] close very close. So it's right in the
[1:06:56] message. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now
[1:07:00] we see
[1:07:01] here that up and down we can be
[1:07:07] busy with our natural
[1:07:11] things,
[1:07:13] job and so
[1:07:15] on. Okay. And now
[1:07:19] here but the angel is telling us to be
[1:07:23] zealous. Hallelujah. And now also when
[1:07:26] you go in the book of
[1:07:29] revelation 17 verse
[1:07:33] 14 because there is something that God
[1:07:37] place in
[1:07:39] you. There is something precious that
[1:07:42] God placed in
[1:07:43] you and that is the power of
[1:07:47] decision. You can decide.
[1:07:52] At first I thought that I will talk
[1:07:53] about a subject called the inner circle
[1:08:01] bride. It is such a wonderful subject to
[1:08:03] talk
[1:08:05] about. You know with that power that God
[1:08:08] gave
[1:08:09] you, you can create a world and you live
[1:08:12] it.
[1:08:15] Hallelujah.
[1:08:17] So here you have decision. Everything is
[1:08:20] on on your
[1:08:23] table. You can decide to
[1:08:27] overcome. Hallelujah. Or you can decide
[1:08:29] to be
[1:08:31] overcome. Hallelujah.
[1:08:34] So here in Revelation
[1:08:38] 17:14, this shall make war with the
[1:08:41] lamb, and the lamb shall overcome them.
[1:08:45] For he is Lord of lords and King of
[1:08:49] kings.
[1:08:51] And they that are with him are
[1:08:54] called and
[1:08:56] chosen and faithful.
[1:09:18] [Music]
[1:09:20] Now, I want you to see something here at
[1:09:21] the end of this uh
[1:09:24] verse. He said that those that were with
[1:09:27] him, of course, we know that that's the
[1:09:31] bride are
[1:09:33] called and chosen.
[1:09:36] unfaithful.
[1:09:38] There are three
[1:09:40] things. And now we see here that called
[1:09:44] they are called the prophecy called by
[1:09:50] predestination chosen by
[1:09:54] election and faithful by their
[1:09:59] decisions. So you see that there is a
[1:10:02] part for us to play.
[1:10:05] There is this
[1:10:07] part destination is for
[1:10:10] God. Choosing is for
[1:10:13] God. But faithfulness is by our
[1:10:19] decision. So you see that you can
[1:10:21] decide, you have that power within. You
[1:10:23] can
[1:10:25] decide to be what you want to be. You
[1:10:29] either been in Revelation
[1:10:32] 4 or you been in chapter
[1:10:34] 3. And when you've been in Revelation
[1:10:37] chapter 3, you be a message believer
[1:10:43] still.
[1:10:44] Okay. Now, if you get time, you can read
[1:10:47] that message. is the masterpieces
[1:10:52] of And now we see that the prophet now
[1:10:56] came on the scene and then he preached
[1:10:58] the the message called the
[1:11:02] rapture. the
[1:11:04] rapture. And now at first I was
[1:11:07] thinking since he's preaching the
[1:11:10] rapture, he is going to go to
[1:11:16] Corinthians as the opening
[1:11:20] scripture. You know that then we who are
[1:11:25] remain then translated and called
[1:11:29] together. Hallelujah. Isn't that the
[1:11:32] rapture?
[1:11:35] But when you read uh the
[1:11:39] rapture, the prophet goes in
[1:11:43] Psalms chapter 27.
[1:11:46] And now remember I told you last time
[1:11:48] that
[1:11:51] everything it is not for
[1:11:54] just it has a meaning
[1:11:57] everything. Okay, let's go in chapter
[1:12:00] 27.
[1:12:04] Psalms.
[1:12:20] Psalms. It says that the Lord is my
[1:12:22] light. I think I can just read in
[1:12:24] English time. The Lord is my light and
[1:12:27] my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The
[1:12:31] Lord is my strength of my life. Of whom
[1:12:34] shall I be
[1:12:35] afraid? When the wicked, even mine
[1:12:39] enemies and my foes came
[1:12:42] upon me to eat my up my flesh, they
[1:12:46] stumbled and fell. Though an host should
[1:12:50] come against me, my heart shall not
[1:12:53] fear. Though war shall raise should rise
[1:12:56] against me, in this will I be confident.
[1:13:00] H one thing have I desired of the Lord,
[1:13:04] that will I seek after, that I may dwell
[1:13:08] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[1:13:11] my life, to behold the beauty of the
[1:13:14] Lord, and to inquire in his temple. For
[1:13:17] in the time of trouble, he shall hide me
[1:13:20] in his
[1:13:21] pavilion. In the secret of his
[1:13:25] tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall
[1:13:28] set me up upon a rock. Hallelujah.
[1:13:32] Hallelujah. So that was the scripture
[1:13:35] for the rapture.
[1:13:39] And then you may
[1:13:42] think maybe you even do maybe you switch
[1:13:45] off the
[1:13:49] message because you may easily think
[1:13:52] maybe you may miss it.
[1:13:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But what does
[1:14:00] the prophet say in the third seal?
[1:14:02] [Music]
[1:14:05] There is something that he warned
[1:14:07] us. He said sometimes when we just
[1:14:13] read that is uh paragraph 14.
[1:14:18] Sometimes when we just
[1:14:20] read and now be real
[1:14:24] careful and when you
[1:14:26] read get the
[1:14:29] taps listen to them real
[1:14:31] [Music]
[1:14:33] close very
[1:14:36] carefully because you can easily
[1:14:40] miss the whole
[1:14:42] thing like when the prophet came and
[1:14:44] preached the seven seals.
[1:14:48] and he was a bit demoralized and because
[1:14:52] he saw people didn't receive them the
[1:14:54] way he expected.
[1:14:59] And when he said now it is questions and
[1:15:03] answers all the questions they ask you
[1:15:06] even feel sorry for
[1:15:09] him like people didn't
[1:15:14] get until when he had until when God
[1:15:18] came and warned
[1:15:21] him and encouraged him and he showed him
[1:15:24] a vision of his
[1:15:26] ministry. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[1:15:29] then he was encouraged. So you can
[1:15:30] easily miss
[1:15:34] it and many are missing it even today.
[1:15:38] Not in the Pentecostals, not in the
[1:15:40] denominations. Forget about
[1:15:45] them. The devil is not there is here.
[1:15:50] is at the
[1:15:51] source because the battle has never
[1:15:55] changed and his ambition has never
[1:15:59] changed and that's why the seals were
[1:16:02] open and the reason why they were
[1:16:06] open the bride had to
[1:16:10] know the false
[1:16:14] vein stripe naked
[1:16:16] [Music]
[1:16:18] there for you to be able
[1:16:21] overcome. And then there's also the true
[1:16:24] vain and of course that's the Lord
[1:16:28] Jesus. Okay? And his tactics have never
[1:16:31] changed since
[1:16:35] Jesus and since up in
[1:16:38] heaven. So they are the same same
[1:16:42] tactics. Same
[1:16:44] tactics and throughout the
[1:16:48] Bible and he will never change. So his
[1:16:51] ambition is to get to the throne of
[1:16:56] God because if that was not his
[1:17:01] ambition, maybe his ambition was to
[1:17:04] start his own kingdom.
[1:17:09] and once he got Cain in the Garden of
[1:17:12] Eden, he would have started the kingdom
[1:17:17] there. But once he got he left him,
[1:17:20] moved
[1:17:22] on. He went to Abel. From Abel, we see
[1:17:25] him
[1:17:27] continuing. And what he does, his
[1:17:30] ambition is to get you
[1:17:35] off. And then he leaves you. You go
[1:17:38] away. You go with the uh the desires of
[1:17:43] your flesh. They draw
[1:17:48] you. They take you further, but he's not
[1:17:50] with
[1:17:52] you. He's not for him. He's always on
[1:17:54] the
[1:17:57] source. You know, there's a brother who
[1:18:01] said that the devil looks at sometimes
[1:18:04] and he handers
[1:18:08] You can do
[1:18:13] this. Hallelujah. Amen. So that's those
[1:18:16] are the tactics of the
[1:18:18] devil. That's
[1:18:20] all that's what the seven sins were
[1:18:23] about.
[1:18:27] And we see that he rides the horse the
[1:18:30] the white
[1:18:32] horse. He rides the the red
[1:18:35] [Music]
[1:18:36] And the prophet say that he he he his
[1:18:39] target is not to stay on the white
[1:18:44] horse but those are
[1:18:46] just his
[1:18:49] tricks. From there he moves up to the
[1:18:52] pale
[1:18:55] horse which is
[1:18:57] death. And of course
[1:19:01] death it means total separation from
[1:19:03] God.
[1:19:07] meaning that the devil has completely
[1:19:08] taken over the throne.
[1:19:13] And I don't know why I'm going ahead of
[1:19:16] myself, but the throne of
[1:19:19] God, the prophet
[1:19:22] said, it was once in
[1:19:25] heaven and then in
[1:19:29] Exodus on Mount
[1:19:32] Sai, you know, Moses saw a vision of
[1:19:37] heaven, the temple of God in heaven.
[1:19:40] God told
[1:19:41] him make something like like that that
[1:19:45] you have seen in heaven.
[1:19:49] And then from
[1:19:50] there it was in Jesus
[1:19:54] Christ. Uh of course you know that Jesus
[1:19:57] Christ was the
[1:20:01] clay of the old
[1:20:05] testament. Hallelujah. So again now the
[1:20:09] throne is now in the
[1:20:15] bride. So the devil's plan the devil's
[1:20:20] battle it is to take the
[1:20:23] throne
[1:20:26] completely and he takes it by the
[1:20:32] pelvis but remember it starts very
[1:20:34] slowly.
[1:20:37] Hallelujah. Amen. So we see that uh the
[1:20:41] prophet say that now the bride is
[1:20:45] smitten. Do you know smiting
[1:20:49] something? It is you know she's
[1:20:54] smitten out
[1:20:57] of Amen. And now we are going to see
[1:21:01] here
[1:21:02] that the bread is smitten by
[1:21:07] what? There is a there is something that
[1:21:09] God has used
[1:21:12] mighty.
[1:21:14] Hallelujah. And the Lord has used the
[1:21:17] six
[1:21:21] seal.
[1:21:23] Okay? You know friends, I want you to
[1:21:25] know something.
[1:21:29] that we don't have any room within
[1:21:33] us as believers of the
[1:21:36] message to debate the word of
[1:21:40] God to debate the
[1:21:44] prophet and the prophet was never in
[1:21:49] error. But when you're reading the
[1:21:53] message, you can easily miss the link.
[1:22:00] And that's why you find the people
[1:22:02] saying why I left the
[1:22:05] message is because they missed
[1:22:08] something. Hallelujah.
[1:22:10] You know the prophet when he was
[1:22:13] preaching the
[1:22:14] seals and mainly when it comes to the
[1:22:16] seven
[1:22:17] seals when you're reading it is story
[1:22:23] stories understanding things.
[1:22:26] You see now for example the the
[1:22:29] disciples asked Jesus
[1:22:31] Christ what will be the time the saying
[1:22:34] of
[1:22:36] your when shall these things
[1:22:40] be and then
[1:22:42] he took them back to the seven
[1:22:45] seals to the
[1:22:48] seals the
[1:22:52] six seals
[1:22:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And when you you
[1:22:57] read in
[1:22:59] Matthew, you will see that he
[1:23:02] took roughly like five
[1:23:05] minutes explaining the six
[1:23:09] seals. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But how
[1:23:12] long did the prophet
[1:23:14] take? Of course. Now when we talk about
[1:23:16] the
[1:23:18] six, you'll find out this is just the
[1:23:22] the calling of
[1:23:26] 140,000 to
[1:23:28] witness the burning of the
[1:23:33] world
[1:23:36] basically. But he will take two
[1:23:40] hours. And he gets now he comes he says
[1:23:44] now now the six seal now 100 now
[1:23:49] 110,000
[1:23:52] from goes back to some stories
[1:23:55] [Music]
[1:23:57] now. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But
[1:24:00] everything is aligned very
[1:24:04] perfectly. Hallelujah. If you see Jesus
[1:24:08] his ministry when they could ask him a
[1:24:11] question we look at the woman at the
[1:24:15] well the way he replied
[1:24:18] her so
[1:24:22] ridiculous if you're not aligned very
[1:24:26] well said oh give me
[1:24:31] that call me your husband
[1:24:36] Is that an answer
[1:24:39] friend? Now they ask him when shall
[1:24:42] these
[1:24:43] things. Now he starts saying
[1:24:47] [Music]
[1:24:48] now they
[1:24:53] darken. Now hear the parable.
[1:24:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So there is
[1:24:59] something friends that was in the seals.
[1:25:03] that we need to get. Maybe you're here
[1:25:06] and you you are still missing
[1:25:09] it. Hallelujah. Because now the prophet
[1:25:12] say that now these
[1:25:16] seals and winds up the whole
[1:25:21] book, the whole book of
[1:25:24] redemption. But remember he said the six
[1:25:30] seals not seven
[1:25:32] seals. We're going to come to that. Why
[1:25:34] did he leave
[1:25:37] the because he said that in the six
[1:25:39] seals
[1:25:41] paragraph I didn't write the paragraph
[1:25:43] here. He says that now remember these
[1:25:44] are hidden
[1:25:48] mysteries and the six seals all together
[1:25:51] in one book.
[1:25:55] Just six
[1:25:57] scrolls rolled
[1:26:00] together and it unwinds the whole book
[1:26:03] of
[1:26:07] redemption. That's how the whole earth
[1:26:09] is
[1:26:10] redeemed. And that's how you are also
[1:26:15] redeemed. So he said that the seeds open
[1:26:17] the
[1:26:19] book and then after preaching the seeds
[1:26:21] he said that now my Bible is my new
[1:26:23] book.
[1:26:27] Hallelujah.
[1:26:29] So after knowing that,
[1:26:33] don't you think you should read seals
[1:26:34] like four times?
[1:26:39] Hallelujah.
[1:26:41] Hallelujah. You read, you finish.
[1:26:49] Now also, okay, let's read the second
[1:26:52] seal.
[1:26:54] paragraphs three.
[1:26:58] I'm going to read this to show
[1:27:00] you something that maybe will appetize
[1:27:03] you to go
[1:27:05] back. Maybe read them
[1:27:08] again. You see now when you look at the
[1:27:11] first
[1:27:13] seal, he's talking about
[1:27:15] deception, the white horse
[1:27:18] rider. Okay?
[1:27:21] But now he comes here
[1:27:24] you know, persecution of the church
[1:27:27] and like almost
[1:27:31] history long
[1:27:33] time. But now here what is his opening
[1:27:38] prayer in the second season. Now we pray
[1:27:43] father that you will come tonight and
[1:27:46] break this second seal for
[1:27:49] us. And as the poet has
[1:27:53] said that he would like to look past the
[1:27:56] curtain of
[1:27:59] time and that's our desire
[1:28:03] Lord is just to just to look past and
[1:28:07] see what lies
[1:28:11] ahead to see what lies ahead.
[1:28:15] Hallelujah. And we pray that the lamb
[1:28:17] that had been slain we will come among
[1:28:23] us now and break the
[1:28:27] seal and reveal it to
[1:28:31] us the things we have
[1:28:37] need. But I thought this is history,
[1:28:39] church history.
[1:28:43] But he is
[1:28:44] saying and that's our desire
[1:28:47] Lord is just to just to look
[1:28:52] past and see what lies
[1:28:56] ahead.
[1:28:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:29:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:05] And
[1:29:06] now let's first go in the seals in this
[1:29:09] sixth
[1:29:11] seal because I say that this is the whip
[1:29:15] that God is using to smite his
[1:29:22] bride. And I say that don't doubt the
[1:29:25] prophet whatever he says just
[1:29:30] believe. Okay? At least
[1:29:33] say Lord may you give me
[1:29:36] revelation to understand this thing. You
[1:29:38] first put it
[1:29:42] aside because now when you start
[1:29:46] talking just know you under now the
[1:29:49] anointing of the horse
[1:29:52] rider the white horse rider.
[1:29:56] Now from there
[1:29:58] it goes now the red and continues until
[1:30:01] you die completely.
[1:30:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:30:12] Now I want to talk about you know the
[1:30:16] prophet say that the sixth
[1:30:22] seal reveals the seven.
[1:30:26] because you know that it remained a
[1:30:30] mystery and that's why he said that the
[1:30:33] six seals unwinds the book of
[1:30:39] redemption not
[1:30:42] seven. You may think I've left my title
[1:30:44] but I'm
[1:30:47] coming. I'm coming if time
[1:30:50] allow. Hallelujah.
[1:30:53] So we see that the seventh seal is
[1:30:56] within the sixth
[1:31:02] seal throughout the
[1:31:05] Bible from Genesis
[1:31:09] Revelation. But we could not see
[1:31:11] it until the prophet opens the reveals
[1:31:15] the
[1:31:17] seals. Hallelujah. By the grace of God,
[1:31:19] I will pick out some few characters in
[1:31:21] the Bible.
[1:31:25] As we go on, I will pick out some
[1:31:29] examples and then we see how did these
[1:31:33] seals what how did the seventh be
[1:31:36] revealed in the
[1:31:42] sixth. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now we
[1:31:47] see
[1:31:49] 1960 19 60
[1:31:54] 1961 the prophet
[1:31:57] preaches Revelation chapter one chapter
[1:32:00] 2 chapter 3 chapter
[1:32:03] 4 and 1961 he's done with chapter
[1:32:08] 5 he's done with chapter five and then
[1:32:12] he put he put a pause
[1:32:15] there up to
[1:32:19] when you know God spoken to
[1:32:22] him. He knew when the time for revealing
[1:32:26] the
[1:32:29] seals when the time
[1:32:31] comes he will know God because God had
[1:32:34] spoken
[1:32:36] spoken. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now
[1:32:39] we see
[1:32:40] here was there then there are six dreams
[1:32:43] that
[1:32:45] came from the believers.
[1:32:50] And now all these six dreams in a
[1:32:55] row. And then the prophet said that they
[1:32:58] were all speaking the same
[1:33:01] thing. And they were speaking the six
[1:33:05] seals six.
[1:33:10] And now the prophet was just there
[1:33:11] seated somewhere in the
[1:33:14] room and then he got a
[1:33:18] vision of the seventh seal.
[1:33:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:33:25] Praise the
[1:33:26] Lord. And now he says here he says
[1:33:31] in in the fifth
[1:33:35] seal if you just know what happened.
[1:33:40] What happened before we left
[1:33:43] there? You understand why six straight
[1:33:46] dreams come exactly with the
[1:33:51] vision? A dream interpreted is a
[1:33:55] vision. And now here is this the sign of
[1:33:59] the end
[1:34:02] sir. Six strange
[1:34:05] dreams. And then the vision kept kept
[1:34:10] it the vision that he got.
[1:34:18] And now what was that that was showing
[1:34:20] the ministry of
[1:34:25] brother mainly when you go in the
[1:34:27] sermons brother Brandham will mainly
[1:34:28] will many times talk about the dream of
[1:34:31] brother junior
[1:34:35] Jackson. Hallelujah. So we see that
[1:34:38] there were six
[1:34:42] dreams revealing the seventh.
[1:34:47] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:34:50] So I I'll first put a pause there on the
[1:34:52] seals. Let's first go back to uh the Old
[1:34:58] Testament and then we link it with our
[1:35:01] chapter 4
[1:35:06] Revelation because of time I may not
[1:35:10] finish. It's Exodus. Okay, I will not
[1:35:13] read it. Just write it
[1:35:16] down. Exodus
[1:35:20] 25. So Moses had seen a
[1:35:23] vision of the tabernacle in
[1:35:28] heaven. And
[1:35:31] now after the pattern of the tabernacle
[1:35:34] in
[1:35:38] heaven and then God told him to make the
[1:35:40] same thing.
[1:35:44] And then it had the outer
[1:35:47] court, the holy
[1:35:50] place, holy of
[1:35:52] holies, which is the
[1:35:58] innermost. Let me hope you're still
[1:36:00] opening
[1:36:01] your Let me hope you're still on your
[1:36:05] Psalms.
[1:36:09] Now you will understand why David here
[1:36:10] said,
[1:36:15] said that verse five that for in my time
[1:36:18] of
[1:36:21] trouble he shall hide me in his
[1:36:25] pavilion in the secret of his
[1:36:28] [Music]
[1:36:30] tabernacle shall he hide
[1:36:32] me. He shall set me up upon rock.
[1:36:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Remember that's
[1:36:40] a scripture for
[1:36:42] rapture. The church goes up in
[1:36:46] Revelation 4. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:36:51] And
[1:36:55] now the prophet here says,
[1:37:00] you can also note down numbers chapter
[1:37:01] 2.
[1:37:05] When you go in the details of how this
[1:37:07] tabernacle was
[1:37:13] made and you focus on the holy of holies
[1:37:16] that there was the ark of the
[1:37:22] convent
[1:37:24] glory.
[1:37:26] Hallelujah. And now I want you to
[1:37:30] see two things from this chapter here.
[1:37:35] Number one,
[1:37:37] uh the the arrangement of these
[1:37:40] tribes, the settlement around
[1:37:46] the is number two. You'll find it there.
[1:37:49] You can read it in
[1:37:51] your divided into three
[1:37:55] three and and the heads were carrying
[1:37:58] the banners,
[1:38:01] the heads of the tribe.
[1:38:05] And now we see Dan, Robin, Judah, and
[1:38:07] Ephra. Judah and
[1:38:10] I want you to see the directions.
[1:38:14] Hallelujah.
[1:38:16] We see that Dan was in the
[1:38:20] north. Robin was in the
[1:38:23] south. Judah in the east.
[1:38:26] Actually, Judah loves east so much.
[1:38:30] Even when you go in
[1:38:32] the book of Hosea,
[1:38:35] you see is talking about Judah.
[1:38:39] Isaiah talking about Judah coming from
[1:38:41] the east.
[1:38:44] Hallelujah.
[1:38:46] So we see that Judah in the east,
[1:38:49] Ephraim in the west.
[1:38:53] [Music]
[1:38:55] Okay. Now I want you to keep that in
[1:38:57] mind.
[1:39:00] In the inner circle there was the
[1:39:02] shakina
[1:39:06] glory two
[1:39:09] cherubams. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[1:39:12] then the prophet comes and
[1:39:15] says that these four uh
[1:39:21] Dan uh Dan, Robin, Judah and Ephraim,
[1:39:25] Robin, Jud, you say that they were
[1:39:28] protecting, they were guarding the
[1:39:32] tabernacle. You cannot just come
[1:39:36] anyhow. But it was only the
[1:39:39] Levites that were around the
[1:39:42] tabernacle. Now you have the
[1:39:45] picture. In the north,
[1:39:50] south in the east, Judah, in the west,
[1:39:54] Ephraim.
[1:39:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I want this is
[1:39:58] taking us back to our chapter
[1:40:03] 4. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:40:06] Another thing that I want you to note
[1:40:09] there, I want you to note that
[1:40:13] uh to enter in the
[1:40:17] inner in the inner part or in the
[1:40:24] innermost you had to be qualified first.
[1:40:30] And the prophet
[1:40:31] says that you need to have some kind of
[1:40:39] perfumes, certain
[1:40:41] clothes. You know, you behave in a
[1:40:45] way. You have to have the
[1:40:48] blood. That's the
[1:40:50] sacrifice. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[1:40:53] then the prophet comes and says,
[1:40:57] even in the Bible, it's there.
[1:40:59] that the perfume that they were using
[1:41:02] was got from uh from the rose of Shon.
[1:41:11] Yes. The rose of Shon
[1:41:13] the bright and morning
[1:41:15] star and that is our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:41:20] Hallelujah.
[1:41:22] So you've got to have those
[1:41:26] perfumes. If if you go with those
[1:41:30] things, you die.
[1:41:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:41:36] And now we see that Ezekiel
[1:41:40] also saw the same
[1:41:44] thing that Moses
[1:41:46] saw. Hallelujah. When you read Ezekiel
[1:41:48] 1,
[1:41:51] I think let's read that.
[1:41:59] 1 chapter 9 to
[1:42:17] 10 their wings. Okay, I'm starting in
[1:42:20] the
[1:42:21] middle the whole chapter one.
[1:42:25] [Music]
[1:42:27] from 9 to 10. Their wings were joined
[1:42:30] one to another. They turned not when
[1:42:34] they
[1:42:35] went. They went everyone straight
[1:42:38] forward.
[1:42:41] As for the likeness of their
[1:42:44] faces, they four had the face of a man
[1:42:50] and the face of a lion. On the right
[1:42:52] side,
[1:42:54] I want you to remember the right side is
[1:42:56] the east
[1:43:01] and they four had the face of ox on the
[1:43:05] left side. That's the west Ephraim.
[1:43:09] They four also had the face of an eagle
[1:43:12] that is to the north and that's done.
[1:43:15] Hallelujah.
[1:43:17] Now from there I think we can continue
[1:43:18] with our
[1:43:21] chapter. You keep those things in
[1:43:26] mind. Revelation chapter
[1:43:31] 4. I still have few minutes to
[1:43:38] [Music]
[1:43:42] what it says.
[1:43:45] Okay, before we go to
[1:43:53] that, okay, it's fine. You can start
[1:43:55] from verse six. Say that. And before the
[1:43:57] throne, there was a sea of glass like
[1:44:00] unto Christ.
[1:44:02] And in the midst of the throne and round
[1:44:05] about the throne uh were four beasts
[1:44:08] full of eyes before and
[1:44:10] behind. And the first beast was like a
[1:44:17] lion. And the second beast like a calf
[1:44:21] and the third beast had a face as a man.
[1:44:25] And the fourth beast was like a a flying
[1:44:28] eagle. Can read brother.
[1:44:45] Hallelujah.
[1:44:48] Hallelujah. Now uh I I will not read
[1:44:52] all. Now we see we all know this
[1:44:56] chapter. Brother Muffin, you can give me
[1:45:01] Number
[1:45:04] [Music]
[1:45:07] three, we all know Revelation chapter
[1:45:12] 4. It talks about one that sat on the
[1:45:17] throne and the 24 elders around the
[1:45:25] throne and then the four beasts around
[1:45:28] the throne.
[1:45:32] Now the prophet told
[1:45:33] us that these beasts of revelation
[1:45:36] chapter
[1:45:38] 4 they are different from the beast in
[1:45:42] revelation chapter
[1:45:46] 7. This was an error in
[1:45:51] writing. No give me another one of the
[1:45:54] stars around there.
[1:45:58] So these are four living creatures not
[1:46:01] beast.
[1:46:03] [Music]
[1:46:07] Hallelujah.
[1:46:14] So we see that these
[1:46:16] beasts are doing the same work
[1:46:21] that
[1:46:24] Denim and Judah they were doing.
[1:46:28] in the Old Testament around the
[1:46:31] tabernacle. Protecting
[1:46:34] what? The tabernacle of God.
[1:46:39] Remember David prayed and said,
[1:46:42] "Lord, oh, I didn't give them to you in
[1:46:45] order." I
[1:46:46] think down of the stars.
[1:46:55] So we see that they are
[1:46:58] guarding and the prophecy that these are
[1:47:02] guards. They are guarding the tabernacle
[1:47:04] of
[1:47:09] God. I think we just leave the that's
[1:47:14] failed. So they are protecting the the
[1:47:19] the tabernacle.
[1:47:23] to go
[1:47:24] there. First of all, you've got to be
[1:47:26] the right
[1:47:27] person. And the right person, I mean,
[1:47:29] the
[1:47:32] Levite. And also to go
[1:47:35] there, you need to have
[1:47:39] uh the blood, the
[1:47:43] sacrifice. I need to have the perfumes.
[1:47:48] And now the perfumes I take them
[1:47:52] as the sixth
[1:47:57] seal. We are going to see if time
[1:48:00] allows.
[1:48:03] Now we see don't look don't see it as a
[1:48:07] church
[1:48:10] as okay bro you can just give me just
[1:48:14] give me that one that you had
[1:48:18] given I can just talk about
[1:48:25] that. So look at it as an
[1:48:30] individual, not a
[1:48:32] church, not
[1:48:35] denomination, but the
[1:48:37] bride. So we see that to leave
[1:48:41] Revelation chapter
[1:48:45] 3, to leave that
[1:48:50] condition, you need
[1:48:52] to be smitten. First of all,
[1:48:56] And those are the
[1:48:59] perfumes. Hallelujah. Of the Old
[1:49:01] Testament. And now another thing, you've
[1:49:04] got to have the
[1:49:06] sacrifice. And then another
[1:49:09] thing, you've got to be the right
[1:49:12] person. You need to have to be dressed
[1:49:15] in a certain
[1:49:17] way. Now, let's break those
[1:49:20] things. This evening, I have good news
[1:49:23] for you.
[1:49:27] I have good news for you that you are
[1:49:30] the right
[1:49:33] person. You're the Levite.
[1:49:37] How because those people to enter in the
[1:49:44] inner you need to be a
[1:49:46] priest and whether what does the Bible
[1:49:50] say? I've made you priests. Amen.
[1:49:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So I don't know.
[1:49:59] I'm going ahead of myself, but it's
[1:50:01] fine.
[1:50:03] So we see that now
[1:50:06] the prophet says that these beasts that
[1:50:09] were guarding the tabernacle of the Old
[1:50:16] Testament. I think you are trying to
[1:50:18] connect
[1:50:20] something. It was done in the north.
[1:50:24] in the
[1:50:25] south, Ephraim in the
[1:50:28] west and Judah in the east. Ezekiel also
[1:50:32] testified of
[1:50:33] that Judah was in the
[1:50:37] east. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And then
[1:50:40] he comes and
[1:50:42] says because they kind of three parts.
[1:50:48] The first part it was the old testament.
[1:50:53] and there are those
[1:50:54] tribes and now we have now the New
[1:50:58] Testament church that was started at the
[1:51:00] day of
[1:51:02] Pentecost. Hallelujah.
[1:51:05] Hallelujah. And now the prophet say that
[1:51:10] Mark okay here it was not drawn very
[1:51:13] well.
[1:51:15] First of all, he
[1:51:16] says that
[1:51:19] four is a number of man.
[1:51:23] It's an earthly number of deliverance.
[1:51:28] And then he
[1:51:30] says
[1:51:32] uh also
[1:51:35] Jesus the duty of
[1:51:37] God was also manifested in
[1:51:41] four to be able to be human to come to
[1:51:44] our
[1:51:46] level. Hallelujah.
[1:51:50] as a
[1:51:52] king. The same person is a
[1:51:56] man. The same person is a servant.
[1:52:00] And yet he's
[1:52:02] God. Hallelujah. Is a little beautiful.
[1:52:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now we see
[1:52:08] that the prophet tells
[1:52:10] us
[1:52:12] that I wrote it where does he say it?
[1:52:19] It says the fourfold manifestations.
[1:52:26] Jesus Christ as a man, as a king, as a
[1:52:31] son, and as a son of
[1:52:34] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I wish you
[1:52:37] had seen the other picture, brother.
[1:52:41] Okay. Amen. It's okay. We can go on.
[1:52:45] So we see that
[1:52:47] uh brother Brham came in the New
[1:52:51] Testament and then he typed those four
[1:52:54] tribes with the four
[1:52:59] gospels of the church of
[1:53:03] Christ and now here it was not drawn
[1:53:05] very well but Matthew's in the
[1:53:09] east and that's Judah
[1:53:13] and now uh Robin, Luke,
[1:53:18] and then Mark the West,
[1:53:23] John in the north.
[1:53:26] Hallelujah.
[1:53:28] This is the wrong image.
[1:53:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[1:53:33] now we see that these people,
[1:53:38] you can see it. These people,
[1:53:40] they all testified of our Lord Jesus
[1:53:42] Christ.
[1:53:46] They talked about Jesus.
[1:53:50] And there's a time when I ask
[1:53:53] myself, why is it that these gospels are
[1:53:56] the
[1:53:58] same? Why didn't they just delete the
[1:54:00] other ones? Then we
[1:54:04] read because you see what Matthew
[1:54:07] says, Mark
[1:54:09] repeats, uh, Luke
[1:54:12] repeats. But
[1:54:14] why it is because the same person
[1:54:17] remember Ezekiel say that these four
[1:54:21] beasts they having the same
[1:54:23] faces. They were the same.
[1:54:27] They going the same one
[1:54:29] direction away they go they don't look
[1:54:33] back. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:54:38] Let me keep my line. So now we see
[1:54:41] that
[1:54:45] Matthew
[1:54:47] he's talking about Jesus
[1:54:50] or he's expressing him as a
[1:54:53] king and then Mark is talking about him
[1:54:56] as a
[1:54:58] servant even if those gospels are the
[1:55:00] same but if you
[1:55:02] go you see there is a way how they bring
[1:55:05] their things
[1:55:09] Luke and Matthew is leaning on on the
[1:55:13] other side.
[1:55:16] The same Jesus but the
[1:55:20] king. And that's why you see it is the
[1:55:23] book of Matthew where you find the
[1:55:28] genealogy from
[1:55:30] David showing that he's a king.
[1:55:34] But Mark never recorded
[1:55:37] that. So, and they were with
[1:55:41] him. So, when you got the birth of Jesus
[1:55:45] Christ, you will see that
[1:55:48] Matthew talks about the wise
[1:55:51] men that brought the gifts. You know, of
[1:55:55] course, the prophet also talks about
[1:55:56] those gifts in
[1:56:00] details. Each
[1:56:02] gift presenting something
[1:56:05] And if you go to Matthew, you'll see
[1:56:07] Matthew never talked about Jesus's
[1:56:10] suffering, the real condition that
[1:56:17] and he said these wise men they knelt
[1:56:20] down and they
[1:56:23] worshiped they brought the gifts show
[1:56:26] him that he's a king.
[1:56:29] Hallelujah.
[1:56:31] And now there are many many many uh
[1:56:33] examples I
[1:56:35] not but I can pick out Luke.
[1:56:39] Luke
[1:56:41] he was mainly leaning towards the side
[1:56:43] of Jesus Christ being a
[1:56:49] man. Hallelujah. It is only the gospel
[1:56:53] of Luke
[1:56:56] that recorded
[1:56:59] uh
[1:57:03] Jesus
[1:57:05] [Music]
[1:57:08] sinking no sorry excuse me it is only
[1:57:13] Luke that omitted
[1:57:16] it but the rest reported about Jesus
[1:57:19] walking on
[1:57:22] What? What was Luke
[1:57:24] saying? Because sance is also
[1:57:29] speaking. Luke was trying to show
[1:57:32] that lean towards him being a man like
[1:57:38] us. Hallelujah. At Luke's
[1:57:42] gospel, you'll see Jesus as a
[1:57:44] compassionate friend.
[1:57:48] go and look at those
[1:57:51] stories. It is only Luke
[1:57:56] that recorded the story of the prodigal
[1:58:00] son. It is only Luke that's recorded the
[1:58:02] the story of the thief on the
[1:58:07] cross trying to show that he's the high
[1:58:11] priest touched by the feelings of our
[1:58:15] family that has been tested like how we
[1:58:18] have been
[1:58:20] tested regardless of your
[1:58:22] sins but he can still be
[1:58:28] merciful. Now I will also pull out
[1:58:32] John. John when you go in the book of
[1:58:35] John remember John is an
[1:58:38] eagle and the prophecy that that's the
[1:58:41] bride's
[1:58:43] gospel the bride
[1:58:45] age. When you got to John never talked
[1:58:48] about any
[1:58:51] parable. Why? It was speaking
[1:58:55] something. It was an open book already.
[1:59:00] Hallelujah. But when you go to other
[1:59:02] gospels, you'll see parables.
[1:59:06] Parables. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[1:59:09] also another thing about
[1:59:12] John. John didn't record miracles
[1:59:15] miracles here and
[1:59:18] there. And yet he was moving with
[1:59:23] him. Because in John we only see like
[1:59:26] seven
[1:59:27] uh miracles of which they are not real
[1:59:31] [Music]
[1:59:32] miracles but they were
[1:59:38] signs show him that he's a son of
[1:59:41] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And his
[1:59:45] main emphasis was he was putting it at
[1:59:48] the open
[1:59:50] book. And when you see John
[1:59:54] He was when you look at his
[1:59:57] gospel
[2:00:00] bonds some hard things. Hallelujah.
[2:00:06] So we ought to read the Bible in a
[2:00:08] different
[2:00:10] way. Hallelujah. And now we see that
[2:00:13] these gospels they were protecting also
[2:00:15] the tabernac of
[2:00:16] [Music]
[2:00:18] God the temple of God. The prophet said
[2:00:20] that that's the Acts, the book of
[2:00:25] Acts. That's the temple of
[2:00:28] God, the New Testament.
[2:00:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And that's how
[2:00:33] we ought to be restored
[2:00:36] back, back to the book of
[2:00:39] Acts. And that's why the prophet came
[2:00:41] and restored us back to
[2:00:44] the because that's the temple of
[2:00:47] God of the New
[2:00:49] Testament. And then when you go, you
[2:00:50] read Revelation chapter
[2:00:55] 4, the message, the
[2:00:59] sermon part three, the prophet talks
[2:01:02] about that in
[2:01:05] details. You can read it. It
[2:01:09] will it will
[2:01:13] enlighten. So we see that it was the
[2:01:15] book of
[2:01:17] Acts. And now because of time I see my
[2:01:19] time is
[2:01:21] running. I want us now to move
[2:01:25] it. We don't look at the
[2:01:28] church, but we look at you.
[2:01:32] And what does the prophet
[2:01:38] say? Oh,
[2:01:42] sorry. Put it
[2:01:46] here. I didn't put it here. Okay. Now,
[2:01:49] what does the prophet say?
[2:01:52] The prophet say that the throne of God,
[2:01:56] it is no long in heaven.
[2:02:01] Don't look I mean don't look at it as it
[2:02:04] is in
[2:02:07] heaven. Don't look at it as it's
[2:02:11] in in the Old Testament
[2:02:16] tabernacle. Don't look it at the New
[2:02:18] Testament church.
[2:02:22] But it's your
[2:02:24] heart right there. Hallelujah.
[2:02:27] Hallelujah. And also science also
[2:02:31] testifies of the scriptures.
[2:02:34] Now he say that the heart is has four
[2:02:39] chambers and it and it is protected by
[2:02:43] 24
[2:02:46] ribs testifying the 24 elders and the
[2:02:49] four
[2:02:53] beasts. Hallelujah is our God
[2:02:56] wonderful the nature testifies of him.
[2:03:00] Science
[2:03:01] testifies though they against
[2:03:04] him but sometimes by error they testify
[2:03:11] that everything testifies of
[2:03:13] him. Isn't he
[2:03:16] perfect? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And I
[2:03:19] love the way how the scriptures do
[2:03:21] together and comes
[2:03:25] together. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:03:28] I remember the story one
[2:03:31] time I was somewhere
[2:03:36] preaching to the Pentecostals mainly but
[2:03:38] they are
[2:03:41] mixed but when I realized that they are
[2:03:43] mixed up with
[2:03:46] Muslims I started by introducing the
[2:03:51] book because now the Muslim they may not
[2:03:54] want to hear
[2:03:56] this. But I told
[2:03:59] them that this is the only
[2:04:03] book that has been testified
[2:04:08] of that has been
[2:04:10] proven.
[2:04:12] And when you read this
[2:04:14] book, you will not find anywhere where
[2:04:17] the scriptures don't come
[2:04:20] together. The scriptures interpret
[2:04:23] themselves.
[2:04:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And it's the
[2:04:28] only book
[2:04:30] and it's the only book that was written
[2:04:32] was first to be
[2:04:36] written around if I'm not mistaken
[2:04:39] around
[2:04:40] 10 400
[2:04:46] BC it was already being
[2:04:50] written. And now I told my Muslims
[2:04:55] friends, I told
[2:04:58] them that this book was written by
[2:05:04] men who moved with Jesus
[2:05:06] Christ, who slept with him, who ate with
[2:05:11] him, and who talked with him and who saw
[2:05:14] him.
[2:05:18] But now when you look at
[2:05:19] the uh the
[2:05:22] Quran, it was written 600
[2:05:29] years. Hallelujah. So I told them, the
[2:05:33] person who wrote it, he was never there.
[2:05:36] He never saw
[2:05:37] Jesus. So I told them, how do you trust
[2:05:42] that
[2:05:43] book? What it is saying about Jesus?
[2:05:47] and then you don't trust this one.
[2:05:51] And then they didn't have what to
[2:05:53] say. So I told
[2:05:55] them your your book that you call Quran,
[2:06:00] you know, I read Quran
[2:06:03] also because of evangelism and the
[2:06:07] challenges. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So I
[2:06:11] could quote them some
[2:06:14] there that they don't come
[2:06:17] together and then I I tell them you read
[2:06:20] the Bible and you find any scripture
[2:06:22] that is
[2:06:25] against but Quran itself it is against
[2:06:30] them. Hallelujah. Don't you love the
[2:06:35] Bible? Glory.
[2:06:38] So we see that he he's the high
[2:06:42] priest that is touched by the feelings
[2:06:45] of
[2:06:47] our that is what Luke
[2:06:50] said and remember for is the earthly
[2:06:52] number of deliverance
[2:06:56] prophets and the throne of God is right
[2:06:59] in the heart of a
[2:07:02] man and the heart of a man that is
[2:07:04] revelation 4.
[2:07:08] the whole of it. Read it. You'll see the
[2:07:09] heart of a
[2:07:11] man. I've told you that science
[2:07:14] testifies that Revelation 4 is the heart
[2:07:17] of a
[2:07:19] man. Hallelujah.
[2:07:27] Hallelujah. I can see the time
[2:07:31] has really
[2:07:33] gone. Okay. I have not finished my
[2:07:39] subject because I told you that the
[2:07:43] bride is smitten out of
[2:07:48] LA by the hand of the sixth
[2:07:54] seal. But next time I will talk about
[2:07:59] that if God allows if I'm given another
[2:08:01] chance.
[2:08:04] May God bless
[2:08:07] [Applause]
[2:08:13] you
[2:08:15] brother
[2:08:21] shalom as he's coming let's pray Lord
[2:08:23] Jesus
[2:08:27] we thank you for the peace of your word
[2:08:29] that you have broken
[2:08:32] usord Father, we pray that may you find
[2:08:34] us when we are
[2:08:37] worthy. We see that this is the food for
[2:08:40] the
[2:08:42] bride and without this we are not
[2:08:46] perfect and without this we can't
[2:08:50] see Lord dear heaven
[2:08:53] father. We pray that may you come and
[2:08:56] take the
[2:08:59] throne. And Lord, may you be may we be
[2:09:02] worthy to go through that open
[2:09:05] door. And may we be welcomed by
[2:09:10] those
[2:09:13] guardians, the four living
[2:09:16] creatures. Lord, may we be worthy to go
[2:09:20] there by your
[2:09:22] love. And Lord Kim, father we have seen
[2:09:25] that that's the only
[2:09:28] solution to the
[2:09:32] condition. May you bless us
[2:09:34] father the precious name of Lord Jesus.
[2:09:43] As brother Martin
[2:09:45] comes maybe you can sing a song brother.

[2:17:47] forth your healing hands
[2:17:50] and set them free. Lord,

[2:18:05] crown of their head to the soul of their
