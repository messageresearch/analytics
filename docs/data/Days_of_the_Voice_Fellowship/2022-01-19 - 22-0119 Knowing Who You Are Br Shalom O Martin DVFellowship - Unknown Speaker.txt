holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he has concentrated for us through the veil that uh that that is to say his flesh and having on high priest over the house of god let us

chapter 2 says that uh and he is the appropriation he is the appreciation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sin of the whole world again no i've read ayah i'm sorry i just realized that i read wrong scripture it is first john chapter 3 verses 2 it says beloved now uh we are the sons of god and is those not yet what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is none of us have ever seen jesus face to of people seeing jesus but the bible tells us we don't know what we shall be too many but when he shall appear my sharing knowing who you are praise be to god the prophet says that i know this to be the truth and i know people don't like people don't realize who you are praise be to god every person in here can live above [Music] it's not because of our strengths but because of his grace praise be to god when we know whom we are we treat together we can live above sin just over the time we need our work praise you to god i mean listen you are here you are the covenant people of god women making the covenant swearing by himself amen god did not give us pope he never met pope to leave the church god never committed pope to leave the church but the holy spirit to leave the church because when jesus [Applause] yes he will remain in the air praise be to god i mean it's not going to step here on earth it is us who will be caught up to meet him it is that portion of jesus in you which will make you rise to me to him praise be the quantity of jesus is the and the quality is increasing in us there are things that you can do for that market to lose it is magnetism you can buy it in the soil some of the diseases come attackers you can heat it up way the introduction of course all things that we are doing already which will make us misrupture today praise be to god because when jesus comes [Applause] will be pulled but when it shall appear by the holy ghost doing and acting and performing the same thing he did when he was here on us [Music] you've received it [Music] you have got the covenant it is written to you swear by god when you realize who you are we amen i mean there are things which are impossible physically but possible spiritually because physically it's very hard for someone to find somebody who doesn't know whether he's a male or a human yeah it is very impossible sometimes you find it's very hard to identify whether someone is christian or is not a christian christian christian and that's what i never want saturn is because if we don't know where we are going to determine what you get we don't know why we are leaving then we have no journey yeah there is no purpose but when [Applause] i will go i was just thinking i was just speaking to myself you know when you're coming to church you have to before even that you have to be meditating about church god what do you have for me today please lord i need to see you come on the reason we are not seeing god in our lives why we don't feel his presence [Music] amen you cannot spend two days without talking to a husband and you're okay the people knows that you are white you always want to know what's happening at home and i believe that is how our god is not settling in heaven when we are not calling on him [Applause] let us when we know who we are understand [Music] jesus my savior [Applause] praise [Music] [Applause] yes [Music] [Applause] [Applause] if you only realize who you are you are sons and daughters of god right now and we are kings don't let satan press anything on you the kid is [Music] i want that to sink remember the other way next day we are talking about claiming our inheritance and i gave an example that your friend your dad is calling there's a land which belong to your dad and i'm the one with the documents [Music] and all along i've been waiting for the right time are you free you come and we go and see what uh the way forward oh what they told you to do to call out even if you are busy that day you will even call your boss [Music] you're not even the way to explain to the boss because you have heart you feel like there is a heart deal i'm not worried that you know you have an inheritance [Applause] [Music] don't let satan place anything on you you are of god oh you are catholic and he has got no right to hold it to god amen when you reach there you will meet the gentleman let me tell him let us go where is the land and when he reaches there i'm telling [Music] [Music] me some 100 000. here is the money pack that is in physical reality it was because you didn't know that you have something precious praise be to god i mean but here god has revealed it to you i'm telling the moment you see [Music] jesus came from glory yes just redeem us because he had it was it has a lot of expectation on us praise it is plain that we find that we found out who you are throw down something [Music] you don't need to feel that air that that child that now i'm child of god because you don't need to first feel electricity no sir because your salvation did not depend on your feelings praise be to god i mean let the devil not tell you why don't you feel that you are so dry right away you're not even a child of god is i'm [Music] so when he was even [Music] whether whatever amen amen listen to what the prophet says it says that men and women it is time that we found out who we are the devil is trying to hide that to hide to is the devil is trying to hide you back every time you open the bible you were over by slumbering you start yearning after everybody you hey even the prophet's english is very hard it is boring good evening friends but brother keep on listening [Applause] amen tell you that you are some little trolled down something you said you're a christian look at your clothes i met a certain young man right there so uh we are sharing yeah he had given me okay i had given me a lift and we are now sharing the word benny asked me [Music] i did not feel small because i have not [Music] evil devoted heart to marriage that way the bible seems to ever exalt himself but here we are talking about knowing who we are amen i mean because we know that god is working it out for our best tell you that you're something okay sorry yeah but we are sons and daughters of god julie manning [Music] but let me tell you something [Music] the life of god is in the human being amen but let me tell you something brother what i'm trying to do is to get the pentacles to get pentecostal to let them realize who they are [Music] if you only know if you only knew who you was tonight that there there would become such a spontaneous poor whale of faith through there will be no need of having a prayer line [Music] we need the spirit of christ in us because when he the holy ghost is coming it is him who will lead us into the truth he will reveal these things to jesus christ [Music] in his presence oh my god that's what makes the devil hungry hey jesus is let the church of god realize who they are romans 8 17 if any if children then hears hairs of god and joined hairs with christ the bible says we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear [Music] [Music] power and of love what would happen i'm not a sinner praise be to god am i even i'm not a sinner neither are you ceremony they didn't understand it we got a blood sacrifice laying there god doesn't even see you he hears our voices but is the reason of this if you can ever get that the scare out of the church and let them realize who they are and to never take ibani and what they are healing will be the simplest message to be preached or anything else the prophet mentioned this in many many the church to know who they are in fact not only fearing evil but even fearing good [Music] amen amen the bible changed that one day when moses went before god when moses came to meet the children of israel because the glory of god is [Music] god is waiting for us god speak to the church he will provide the interpreter praise be to god sometime you pray until you feel like you want to prophesy the devil tells you will sort it out amen amen i mean because even the bible tells us amen prophecy there must be wittinesses and they examine it but he never tells us the person who prophesied to examine it have you ever had that verse i have brought into the holy of holies just open yourself to god wait away praise be to god let us cast out fear amen we have to receive from god my friends this message is not words but god always vindicates each and every message that god's fault if you listen to every message at the beginning of that message or the end of the message many times god comes and confirms [Music] [Music] [Applause] amen they are men ah they were just from graduation and they were still under that anointing they told the guys we have learned that this but the bible amen when they told that kind of syllable god we have none of them it did not mean that they had nothing to give him they had a precious stone of sapphire that we have jesus in our soul hallelujah amen will be in danger the devil will be just like a rebel moving in the country i let us get enrolled praise be to that speaks amen [Music] [Music] not you we are sons and daughters of god not way off in the future see more visitors but now amen we want something in future set in heaven places [Music] that angel is always every everywhere where because speak for ourselves amen [Music] but remember when [Music] [Music] human mind they may not even seem but bragging i have to brag about [Music] he hear our voices he don't mind they don't see us but to hear our voice praise be to god i'm about to finish you see that may not even seems to qualify twins nevertheless they are the messenger for their age [Applause] [Applause] blemish far outnumbered those who whose story seems to be perfect through the holy spirit and he put within them praise be to god and when i think of abraham with all the mystic that he made and moses and moses and his name is mistake but when abram's commentary was written [Applause] he never mentioned one thing about abram's any belief hey of god was strong giving praise to god don't look at your mistakes as long as you're in that party because you will commit many mistakes amen but let us press on make you forget when you [Music] because the blood of jesus amen i mean you will be called over the bride oh my god praise be to god all right this is the message the revelation of jesus christ he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church now praise be to god sometime when i'm in that city [Applause] and you look at the people they others are doing [Music] [Applause] [Music] it is my desire on that help us lord to young commander all of us to know why we are here you know whom we are alone it is our prayer we pray that you give us the holy spirit many many times that will throw all of us into desperation in jesus name amen amen holy is [Music] let us rise up [Music] me [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Music] [Music] everything that you had maybe
