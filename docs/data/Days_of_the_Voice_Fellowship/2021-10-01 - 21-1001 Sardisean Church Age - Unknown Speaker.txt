in where have we stopped the last time we were together we finished sister agnes god bless you for joining us online how many have been reading and i've finished the church element now finished it god bless you wealth god bless you whereas god bless you bless you what about you no you are already finished is there anyone who i had promised a gift and they never got their gift no one all of you got a gift but no one came back that's right you don't want to thank but you have to receive all right but was there ever got their gifts it was just a token to encourage you to continue in the word of god that's a gift from me but god wants us to give you his own gift gift of the word ghost this is what you desire to be able to get amen amen that's the reason why we are starting all these things to get to know him because that was not him his life not only to know him as in knowing the knowledge but to also not give me the power of his resurrection um so today we have to begin in the suggestion charge age and this is a which number which age is it so i'm sure that you have enjoyed all the rest now as we are starting here i'd like someone here two people or three to tell me what was the most outstanding thing they have gotten they have got they have been able to get from the rest from the previous chapters we have covered with the church what was the things that really stood out for them that they have been able to capture they have been able to get anybody here i want two three people metroid is very outstanding all right but the joy one money this okay so uh all right sister over there sister [Music] go ahead [Music] [Music] hey man so what is sabbath and the virgos will seal you and then you will have your and so when does a man rest someone rests when he rests from his wax not so so when does a man rest from his wax according to the sabbatarians brother calls them that it's about sanitarians those of us who just keeps up a day those are italians or sanitarians whatever it is according to them a man rests from his wax when he stops cooking when he stops washing clothes when they stopped saying you know whatever it is that they were doing uh going to job and then they rest and they're going in their temples or their churches they'd be there according to them the rest and that's the day this day for them in a week they rest only one day but for the believers of this precious message we have known that we rest from our works one time forever hallelujah we don't need to rest keep resting every week keep resting everybody keep resting no why whoa listen this is so beautiful when jesus christ before jesus quest came the jews were entering into the the the holy place but they could not enter into the holy of holies why because the world of warriors was where the shekinah glory was was where the presence of god was was where god himself was but in there the high priest would enter into that place only once every year every year and he would enter in after he has been sprinkled with blood but that plant was the blood of bulls and gods so it had to be and also that thing that process was a continuous process because our blood was not permanent amen but when jesus christ came and he died on the cross those walls of the world between the one place and the holy one is broke those words broke meaning there was now a permanent entrance amen ushered or opened now for everyone who is willing to enter in there not only the high priest now all of us now became priests and we would be able to enter there because our high priest jesus christ the lamb now that takes away the sins of the world once and for all one time forever he had entered in there into the holy of what is hallelujah and he was able to get life for each and every one of us he said i am the way the truth and the life and he said that whosoever comes to me he will get what he'll get life he has left you know now we notice that jesus christ when he entered in there when he died his death on the cross was what actually answered him in there and after all of us together with him hallelujah for us our summer's rest is not keeping over sudden death sunday or saturday some people think that now we don't get saturday we keep standing sunday is not our summer's rest just like saturday is not our it's about blessed our summer to rest when we rest from our works what what the works of the flesh the bible the book of galatians 3 he says the words of the flesh are manifest and these are number one envy adultery continue yes idolatry strike yes come on now lasciviousness yes malice yes consciousness yes oh those are the words of what anger fruits of anger whatever it is those are what's of the flesh lust those are what's of that flesh now the moment you receive the holy ghost however because when jesus died on the cross he went to the grave and when he went to the grave he came out of the grave and when he came out of the grave he went to heaven and when he went to heaven he came back down again in the form of the holy ghost things that you used to do that's why we sing at some of the things i used to do i do them no more there are fun our sabbath rest is receiving the holy ghost because when you see the holy ghost you have rested from your what the words that we're talking about here are the human works of the flesh and then we begin to do the works of their spirit or the works of the spirit which is now something else which is not those of the flesh the bible also says the words of the spirit are manifest and these are love patience joy faith goodness kindness speak loudly some of you are just saying things that you don't know you must say what you know all right come on nicknames patience these are the works of the work of the flesh of the spirit blood of the flesh right because of the spirit when you when you you rest from the others you begin doing other words some people try to do these words when they don't have the holy spirit you cannot you are just trying to be a hypocrite when you try to make you make yourself do it you can never do it properly and also when you do it you cannot be good because you'll be a hypocrite you will be doing it and doing the other one you have to receive the holy spirit and then you will do it automatically hallelujah amen why are you doing the why you behaving the way you behave because that is you so when you receive the holy spirit in you you will behave the way the holy spirit behaves it is natural hallelujah so it's not forced it's not a work of affliction it's the work of the spirit in you christ in you living the life that he has he lived when he was on earth so that was a very good outstanding something that you learned from the church so far and we covered that yes and it was so amazing to find out that many thought that it was sunday other saturday but it's neither of those days it is made up of this and now so someone may ask why do we now fellowship on sunday we fellowship on sunday because sunday is the day that jesus christ rose again from the grave and jesus when he rose from the grave where did he go the first place he went to was where the disciples were gathered all of them were gathered together in here and why were they gathered they were gathered in that place in fear trying to plan what they should do next and then jesus christ came and he appeared before them and since that time the believers have continued together that same day in commemoration of the resurrection of our lord jesus christ every first day of the week we were gathering so that's the reason why we also contribute because we are following what the apostolate actually is doing but it is not like a norm or a mask you can also gather on saturday but we we really respect sunday as the christians because that was the day our lord rose from the dead that's why if you are a true christian you cannot stay at home on sunday you cannot you cannot that's why some people call it the lord this day why because it was the day when he rose from the dead in the morning you cannot go to your workout instead of going through to the house of god even when you are very far from the church you can at this stream if you can't stream at least you will walk and find another even if it's happening with something you attend there you have to go there on a day like that and worship god because that's when the delivers god to remember the resurrection of jesus christ hallelujah amen god bless you all right you let me pick your brother now okay you are you you're down i should be again all right okay right yeah what i learned from this search engine uh we learned tonight not not the world started because we have not completed yet yes but you from what we have covered so far yes apostolic church they preach the gospel a true word and the manifestation of the gift of the holy spirit and we learned that the true gospel is not only the word but it's it's both the word and the manifestation of the power amen hallelujah that's quite a very very outstanding thing for us to be able to learn from this from this study that the true church the first point you said the true church of god yes what is our pattern what is the true church of god pattern the after what can we say that this is our foundation we are back we are pattern we are patterned after that we are patterned we must be attacked after the first church at the usually what was the first started derivam like on the day of pentecost what was it like it had two things number one it had the true word of god and number two that richard had the true manifestation of the power of god in science and and in davis manifestations of the spirit even if that church claims to preach their word but when they do not have any manifestation among them we learned that that's not the truth that jesus even if that church has the true manifest seems which would be like the true manifestation but has not pure word of god we land that's not the truth that's it because we also saw there is a first vibe and ah a true vine the first vine is that one which claims to be the true vine but actually it does not have the characteristics of the true vine the true vine has two characteristics and it should always work side by side together the first one is the pure word of god it must teach what the bible says everything that is in here everything the apostles taught whether it's small or big that church must believe it hallelujah whether it is women modesty how they should treat themselves how they should redress it seems small they benefit says that that is not concerned the true church of god all through the edges will stick with what the apostles taught hallelujah whether it is about children baptism they will not accept it they will say baptism for others who can hear believe and confess they must also believe baptism in the name of our lord jesus christ that true church must teach everything the apostles should have glass they must believe god for the manifestation of his spirit among them in science and diverse manifestations when i said i was masters i mean many manifestations for example come on we're in a bible study times interpretation yes healing yes prophecies yes designment of spirit yes this gifts of wisdom yes of knowledge yes give some helps yeah that's a gift too and others look all these gifts must be in the body hallelujah that church must be alive no man's church it must be alive people who are alive even when you see when you see a tree which is alive how does it behave it is like it is all the time worshiping hallelujah that church must have received that full restoration of worship not just the staggering and the dormant and looking dead because we are restored today through teachings and then as long as we receive these two teachings you are going into rapture when you are no having no life at all if your religion has no life but it will give you one with life therefore this message came to make us bury our religion to that life and give us one with life this message must have life when you are sending your soul you must have life not just saying just saying like we used to sing in the nomination some of you would not even go in those denominations you would be there we stand stand up [Music] jesus left hallelujah he left a church that has a life in it amen if you're going to sing that song you sing it with life this he said these men are not drunk with alcohol but they are drunk they don't like it but the true child will love it that's one thing we learned you see this in this study has been so good for us to learn all these things what else someone else yes when you dress right hallelujah we land hallelujah that you are what don't save you now we have a religion we call it them legalists that believe that your works save you that when you do good works you've got to believe the muslims believe that do you know that the muslims believe if you do good things according to their religion you go to jannah and you know you marry up for wives you love them equally you take care of them equally and then also you kill these non-believers and then also you do those kind of things that are good you know you don't treat others and things like that then you will go to dinner even in christianity some people teach those kind of things that if you do good works if you dress well if you don't fornicate you don't commit adultery you don't smoke you don't drink you don't wear jewelry you don't uh you know cut your hair as a sister you don't uh you know you younger men you don't go to this alcohol and drink and you know you don't do these things you will see god you are going in heaven so they start doing those things so that they can be able to bribe god to go to heaven if you are like that then you do not understand that when you are studying none of us will ever do those things to go to living if you are one among them just know you are not you are understood to christianity is not the things that you do but also we found out that we go to heaven by our faith hallelujah now some people think faith you just believe and you know do you understand they say you just believe believe bill jesus rose from the dead i believe you believe do you do i don't care to do i just believe you believe in being one i believe you can you wear me no problem can you you know cut your hair sister no problem what i believe you see that kind of they think that when you believe you believe you believe it is what is in your heart but what is outside but we have found out in our study that actually that your faith serves you and that your faith is manifested in your works it is your words that you do by faith that will take you to heaven hallelujah it is not your works but it is your works that are manufactured out of faith john what was it james say show me your faith without your words and i will show you my faith by what by my works then we learn no matter what you say you are we see you by what you do even if you say look at me i am a man of the tree but you have onions from you which i'll just laugh at you look at me i'm orange but you have a lot of what lemons on you you just wasting time it's not what you do is what you are and what you are is what you will manifest hallelujah therefore what we have learned that works and faith go on in hand you only do what you are someone say that it's not what you dress it is what uh you believe and then i said okay that your heart depends on the nature of your heart then i said all right based on the nature of your heart what type of heart takes you to wear a mini skirt what type of hair takes you to a shop to buy a trouser when you're a woman what type of heart is that one you think that's that kind of art will go to heaven it is so lustful that loves the things of the world a heart that is a savior a heart that loves a man to be sexy to be appealing to men so that you can draw very many of them to help because jesus himself said that a man that will look at a woman to lust after her not the other way around a man that will look at a woman to rush after her he have already committed adultery but why would it be to rule why because jesus knew that the devil is using the sense of vision see when you see then you see you see that is good you you are you are taken away you are you are enticed you know the bible says that no man no but no man that good terms but a man is tempted by his own last and when lust is conceived then what happens it brings forth see and when sin has finished with you what does it bring it brings forth death so that's the process there are five jesus tries to help us to cut that process by saying your eyes should be covered hallelujah then we see that our works that we do are only a manifestation of what we believe it's a manifestation of our faith that one we see in the message then after people begin to tell you out there why do you do this don't even force them to do those things when they are not believers it's just like forcing a bee to really clean itself up and perfume itself you know some some of you have very wrong approach you find people there they are wearing their trousers they are not believers and you begin judging them surely we believe that you don't judge me your body now in your mouth that thing is that you because you stay on the ones the pig will look at it okay so so that the people think you have a problem but actually the problem is for both with both of you because you are saying the right thing but you are sending it to a longer person in a longer place so when god is calling us he doesn't tell us to do things we don't know to do he tells us come hallelujah you know so when you minister to those people don't immediately go and start talking about the addressing you know don't immediately go and begin to conduct them and tell them you're going to hell no that's not christianity that's not the gospel the gospel is good news so when you go to these people tell them about salvation how they will talk to their soul usually that's what i do that's why when i whenever i go out there i baptize people why because when i preach the gospel to the new people especially i don't i endeavor to touch their soul that's the purpose you touch you make the person feel that they need something they don't have but if someone thinks you are just there to judge him and cut cut him to pieces and put him in the fire he will say ah even if you have to come there maybe you will got to go finish me completely but let them know that they need something that you have something they don't have make them realize that there is something they need to have amen preach them christ tell them about salvation tell them about how he died for them tell them about the resurrection of the world turn over the name of jesus and how powerful the name of jesus is ask them whether they have been baptized in that name tell them about god tell them about you know when they realize that they will come actually one of them came satan said i realize every one of the women i notice they don't wear trousers is it a doctrine here i was like oh that's now a good time now sit down since i tell you hallelujah then you pull up the scriptures i don't even explain i just read this okay that's why we do that next sunday you will find out also coming with a dress and that will be the end of trousers amen let us let the preach the gospel of words let us preach the gospel of faith the gospel that makes men to repent of their sins the gospel that makes men to realize that they need something that you have and when they come let them notice that christ can change them hallelujah and of course when you find a ship in the big wallows it has a problem it is sick and when you pick it out and wash it it will not go back but if you pick that big it will just go back because it's a big beginning you understand so we don't know what sometimes we go collect people watch them but sometimes they go back you know it just shows who they are but if you're a child of god you can't come back you can't come but you're gonna listen but you can't find peace there until you run back and say oh lord i don't belong there i'm sorry for all the things i've done because you're a seed of god that was a good one i have someone else you were raising up your hand oh that was from us all right someone else here was raising up there and goes did you bother is it doesn't matter what name you have on your door it is about what is inside there some people think that you believe the prophet yes you believe that the message is fulfilled yes you believe no problem who told you who told you many of them are not even going to go none of them are not going to go hallelujah the setups are not what they say it is not what they say they are it is what they really are yeah but increase your volume voice what i've learned is that even in the days of the old testament now separated and in a more clear way we can understand what to say that as we we studied in the church stages see that the trick the devil uses yes yes amen have you heard that that is the way the devil got eve and asked where the devil will get anyone even today the moment he makes without the word he has already got you in his hands but thank god that they believe us a true believer believes that no matter the situation around them they believe that what hallelujah you believe abraham believed that he was counted up to him for righteousness and the rest believe others would believe that's how they were counted to be righteous because they believed not even writers but righteousness was what was given to them because they believed the word so you must always believe the world regardless of the situation or condition that's around you hallelujah all right uh i think that's it uh can we now develop into the sufficient age i think that's wonderful it shows that you people have been following and that is very very encouraging okay so i i'm going to put put it on here and [Music] you will be listening in and then we shall pause whenever we discuss something if you have a question you just put up your hand and then i will reposition oh i realize i never did have this downloaded so i'm going to need a moment here sort that out okay just give me 20 seconds how many agree that this message is really sweet you know when you usually get into this message you realize that it is so sweet hallelujah it's really so sweet and um i've been enjoying it for years and i tell you every day i discover it's like a when you enter gold miner you start mining and you mine that mine and mine and you are not finishing it that's how this method is the deeper you go the sweeter you pick more god more god more god this is god tried in the fight if you like it is up the bible and then by the time you you finish starting the message you will have the bible as a new book the bible becomes a new book to you and there are five that's what we want so we don't want across the book water open all right so i think by now it must have finished downloading here yes so let me get to play with you you can follow in your book and uh and as you are listening to the voice [Music] revelation revelation and unto the angel of the church in sardis right these things sayeth he that hath the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know thy works that thou hast to name that thou livest and art dead be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for i have not found thy works perfect before god remember therefore how thou hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch i will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour i will come upon thee thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raymond and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches sardis sardis was the capital of ancient lydia it passed from the hands of lydian monarchs to the persians and thence to alexander the great it was sacked by antiochus the great the kings of pergamus then succeeded to the dominion until the romans took over in the time of tiberius it was desolated by earthquakes and plagues today it is a heap of ruins and uninhabited this city was at one time very important commercially plenty said that the art of dying wool was invented here it was the center of wall dying and carpet weaving it had a goodly amount of silver and gold in the area and it is said that gold coins were first minted there it also had a slave market the religion of this city was the impure worship of the goddess civilian the massive ruins of the temple may still be seen you will recall that in the pergamian age i mentioned that the babylonish concept of mother and son known as semiramis and ninus became the sibley endious of asia the attributes attached to these two are most enlightening as we view them side by side he was the sun god she the moon goddess he was the lord of heaven she the queen of heaven he the revealer of goodness and truth she of gentleness and mercy he the mediator she the mediatrix he with the key that opens and shuts the gates of the invisible world and she with an identical key doing likewise he as the judge of the dead she is standing at his side he being killed raised and ascended into heaven she carried their bodily by the sun now in rome okay i want us to look at before we continue so much i want you to look at here as it begins to describe the city of service sardis was the capital of ancient lydia it passed from the hands of lydian monarchs to the persians and thence to alexander the great it was sacked by and remember you remember the questions and you remember the how many remember that i think we use we covered some time back regarding the uh the image that daniel saw how may i remember that the four kingdoms so do you remember the four kingdoms so which one was the passion then which one was that of an examination do you remember that i think i have a picture here of it i don't know all of you look as if you don't remember anything at all and this is something that we we have talked about here yes go ahead brother speaking the head of god the babylonian empire ruled by who at that time siri yes yes brother i'm hard but i wanted to be you know i want you to know what you're talking about because that's exactly true and it's what you're talking about so you need to speak it as if you believe it all right go ahead okay if okay you have the picture there now you can go ahead and explain um the second kingdom was the mid and the persian empires which were represented by the wrists and arms of sin then the third was the belly and thighs of brass was the macedonian empire the greek right uh we find out that um here they are saying that satis was a capital was the capital of the ancient lydia it passed from the hands of the of the lydian monarchs the passions and of course by the time the passions came that was after them caneza you understand what i'm talking about so that was after nebuchadnezzar then they went through the kingdom of the passions the the empire the passions then on down after that then the kingdom of the alexander the great the the emperor actually the young man who ruled the whole world and it was sacked by the anti by by anti antiochus the great the kings of pegamos then succeeded to the dominion until the romans took over of course you know the romans came came came much later down here on the legs of iron huh that's when the the the romans came after that oh we didn't have that projector but i'm seeing the picture here but of course you can see this on youtube so the romans come much much later and uh they also still took over their rule of uh the city of lydia or in science so in the time of tiberius costa hiberius how many are not like tiberius i mean i've heard of that name before only one person but you you all have had it because you have read this part have you not taken yes by the way if you're studying and you're reading don't just listen as if you're listening to some music when you see something that you have not ever known about research make a research about it huh you have google you know you can use google someone called it brother google he said the only thing he will not do is to go to heaven but the rest he knows you will ask him who is and everything about you but actually brother google knows everything but he cannot go to heaven because he has no holocaust you know he would if you ask him what's the holy ghost he will explain but but he cannot receive the holy ghost but you can just explain it so you understand so this message is not about knowing knowing yeah he knows all the theology but he doesn't know the life he doesn't have the life you understand to have and to know are two different things so i don't want you only to know and i don't want you all into half you should have both amen okay so tiberius was a roman emperor like like uh constantine and others so it was a hymn in the time of tiberius it was desolated by earthquakes and brains excuse me today it is a leap of rings sahip rather of rings and and it inhabited so so the city was at a time very important commercial and uh so of course here down there then it brings in the religion of this how city were watching the goddess the cyber you know cyborg i think we've also talked about it in the previous chapters the massive rings of the temple may still be seen so you will recall that in vega the pegament eight i mentioned that the bablonish concept of mother and son i'm gonna remember that we talked about that in the babylonian empire you know about the mother and son and he tied it in together we got to happen in rome he was showing us that the religion of mother and son did not just begin now it started back at them in vegas and we see the same thing happening today the same religion of mother and son you know hey mary mother of god so there is a mother and then they deserve a son the son god and a mother go there that kind of religion so it says you remember that idea known as this semiramis and the nairs became the cybele and the owners of asia so you realize that in every part of the world there was this same idea in every time there was that same idea over over goddess and a god goddess and a god when they go to india they have their version when you go to arab arabian countries they have their fashion when you go to the middle east they have their fashion when you come to africa they also have their fashions you know you know us also they have that version of nazi namibia and um then you're there when you go to europe when you go through easter when you go everywhere they had their passion those are pagan versions of who god is you see it's the same idea and this was the same idea that it was not trans transferred into a a church system a religious system so i want you to follow to follow through here and we see how he is explaining now the version of service as a as a city and as a place right are we following on so i wanted to be following very very closely so that you don't get to miss any idea if something passes you then you can ask you don't need to just uh sit back and relax because the great the kings of pergamus then succeeded to the dominion until the romans took over in the time of tiberius it was desolated by earthquakes and plagues today it is a heap of ruins and uninhabited this city was at one time very important commercially plenty said that the art of dying wool was invented here it was the center of wall dying and carpet weaving it had a goodly amount of silver and gold in the area and it is said that gold coins were first minted there it also had a slave market the religion of this city was the impure worship of the goddess civilly the massive ruins of the temple may still be seen you will recall that in the pergam age i mentioned that the babylonish concept of mother and son known as semiramis and ninus became the sibley and the oes of asia the attributes attached to these two are most enlightening as we view them side by side he was the sun god she the moon goddess he was the lord of heaven she the queen of heaven he the revealer of goodness and truth she of gentleness and mercy he the mediator she the mediatrix he with the key that opens and shuts the game the son of god and the moon god the son of god is the lord of heaven the the the the the moon god is the kingdom of heaven the son of god is the reveal of goodness or truth the the moon god is the one of jesus and mercy the son of god is a mediator and she's the mediatrix you see so jesus can immediate but also american idea it came from right here it's of the invisible world and she with an identical key doing likewise he as the judge of the dead she is standing at his side he being killed raised and ascended into heaven she carried their bodily by the sun now in rome this same god is given the title of our lord he is called the son of god while she is called the mother of god now that is what we found back there in the other two ages where the mother and son concept took on such tremendous proportions but now notice that even as it was back in babylon that the worship of the sun began to lose out in favor of the worship of the mother so she literally began to take the place of the sun we see in this age that the pagan worship of sardis was the worship of the woman it is civilly alone not civilly and the oes the mother has literally taken the place of the sun endowed with the merits of godhead all one needs to do is go over her various titles and recall the lovely attributes accorded mary by the roman church to understand where the religion of this age came from two things really struck me with force as i looked into this worship of civilly one was the fact that she wore a key like janus which gave her the same authority as janus key to heaven and earth and the mysteries and the fact that the worshipers whip themselves until blood spurts from their bodies which thing is done right today by the catholics who feel they are suffering like the lord the fact that this is the age of the first real break with papal rome that actually flourished no doubt caused the jezebel prophetess to consolidate and emphasize her doctrine of meriolatry in decided opposition to the protestants who denied her any part whatsoever in the plan of salvation apart from her favor with god as the virgin chosen to bear the babe as luther crystallized the doctrine of justification by faith they held to works penance prayers and other unscriptural means and as the freed christians glorified the sun the roman catholics increased their deification of mary until the 20th century saw in opposition to most high-ranking roman theologians pope pius literally exalt mary to glorification in a resurrected body that doctrine is absolutely the babylonish one of the sun carrying the mother bodily into heaven no wonder this fifth age goes right along with the other ages and will do so until it ends in the lake of fire where the and her children are killed in the second death there it is marioletry the worship of siboli by the way did you know that sibilly was the astarte that jezebel was priestess to and caused israel to stumble by the licentious rights that she conducted yes that is who she this paragraph is very very important and i wonder it goes right along with the other ages and he says uh so until it ends in the lake of fire where the war and the children are killed in the second day and you go in the book of revelation in your mind give me that verse i want to see what the bible says about the war and our children of course in the relation chapter 20 is when saturn is bound and the millennium happens read 19 revelation 19 20. mm-hmm and the beast was taken and with him the first prophet that that wrote miracles before him okay before him and that right for him which with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image of course you know what that image is how many who knows that what that is yes go ahead bro what's the image who wants to correct you what's the image yes it's the sound the wide concept charges they call they coming together all the denominations of the world they will create an image to the beast this is the image all right where was i these both were cast alive into the lake of fire with brimstone the first prophet and the beast and all of them that worship this image and this lack of fire is the second day separation with god that's the death of the souls now these days that we die here is not a real date by the way that is frustrating do you think it's a real day hey that one is just changing this nation you are going to have hair which is also not burning but also don't think you are going to throw parties in here in here there's no throwing parties because there's a place of discomfort it's a place of discomfort i wanted to imagine you in a place where you you're not burning up completely you're not dying but you you are discomforted you are you you are not happy you are tormented suppressor of torment i think that's the right one i was looking for you know to make a day each day out day waiting for this time and imagine suffering waiting for this time when would this time be this time would be after the millennium so people who are going to hell they will be there and then we're going to the millennium and then we finish it we finish the marriage supper we finish the berenium when they're still there so friends don't think it's going to be a a simple thing it's going to be a very difficult thing when you have an opportunity and you're still young utilize your time and don't go to hell you see if you go to hell surely you will be tormented you will be tormented don't serve god because of fear of hell love god and serve him because you know that you don't belong to hell you belong to him and your portion is not in here but i know that there are people here on earth and in this room where we are now there are some of those also who are not going to go to hell but they are going to go in heaven and when they reach there they will rejoice with god for three and a half years they'll come back down here in the space of a thousand years a millennium with christ and rule with him then we shall be super men and super women you'll find that black people are playing and doesn't move his acting doesn't superman they are trying to do a replica of what we are going to be in the iranian those things is going to happen but not here there you have seen those things of uh vamp is it vampire not vampire those things of uh is it those things that they say that come from whatever another planet audience hey you hit it and then you catch into peace and then joins itself again together you know those ideas i don't know where science gets them from but actually this is what it's going to be like you cannot be killed once you added to the other body you can't die again even the bible says hallelujah i feel religious right now the bible says amen when we enter into the other body there will death will have no power the second lack of power over us imagine what i'm saying is just right here you can check it you go to the next chapter chapter 20. actually to get the whole picture read read from chapter from from from from verse one oh you only needed to go to the next chapter yes it says and i saw an angel chapter 20 verse one and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he had and he laid hold on the dragon that all serpent which is the devil and saturn and bound him a thousand yes and when he bound him for a thousand years where where are you where will you be yeah where will you be that never is going to be about a thousand years where would you be you will be the same type okay but where would you be or but where why the devil is bound in the bottomless pit for a thousand years where will you be yes we are we are in the bible study here now so don't forget to bring your views here now we're gonna be well yeah it's not a place millennium is a period of time yeah millennium is a thousand years we know we are going to be within that time also but we are what shall we be doing at that time hey you people hallelujah do you know what the millennium is going to be for us i think we should talk about it millennium is a place millennium is a time a period of a thousand years where we shall not die where we shall not be sick where we shall be with the lord for all that time we will not be serving the lord because we are not his servants at that time just like you brothers wanting to marry waves to serve you waves about your servants what's really are supposed to be your queens hallelujah one that you rule your kingdom with you know brother when you're married you're a king and you have a queen you rule your kingdom with her yes sir therefore when we have entropy in the millennium we are going to rule because the bible says they will rule with a lot of iron not so the lord of iron meaning without mercy his wife is fighting not what shall they be doing they shall rule with him remember the battle says what about the 144 where would they be there will be a millennium too they will be in that city too and what would they be doing they will be serving the bride okay sister let me put it this way once you've finished your wedding why should i finish your wedding when where does the wedding happen in jack yes therefore our wedding with christ is happening in the church whenever the word we hear the word we say amen we are taking our votes we are taking our votes we say amen they're like amen amen you're taking your vow hallelujah he's speaking and you're speaking back with amen yes in sickness yes amen that is about we are bowing in charge but after our vows in the church where do we go in this ceremony people some of you are changing things quickly when you come when you run away from the church after taking the bus where do you go immediately you go to the reception and where do you what do you do at the reception you celebrate it's a celebration it's a rejoicing time and where is that going to be in heaven hallelujah you have your self is attached that's what we are doing here on earth that's the sometimes it's so boring but i want to just go with my wife and we would rejoice and then we go to our our things so you you don't want the child to be very ah that's what we are going through right now sometimes you can get tired sometimes you can say every time going to church as if it is you know but if you know you really want to marry this man you don't care even if they take a whole day i'm there right hallelujah people can be late but i've never seen a a a a woman going to get married refusing to come to church even if she's ready like nothing but some people say i thought i was sorry that excited to stay at home are you really going to get married jesus christ it rained my thing this happened really hey you don't know what you're talking about all right first one after this waiting happens in the chat then you go somewhere where the food is prepared and our food is going to be prepared in heaven where he said i will not drink this fruit of the valley again with you i will not eat this bread again with you but you might when they're in heaven [Applause] he will come for us and pick us and take us there hallelujah and when we are in heaven when we all get to heaven what a day oh that will be when we see jesus we will sing is enough and shout that's one of the waiting after you finish the chapters now it's time for shouting and rejoicing hallelujah because you are really happy the wedding is done you understand yeah you have tied the knot that's going to be in heaven then when we come down from glory hallelujah when we come down from heaven usually what they go after the marriage supper after the wedding supper of course the wedding suffer with us is going to be there in heaven for only special time you cannot be there for a long time you're eating it that's not the big deal that the big deal is for you to be with your wife right so then the people is not the wedding they're waiting that is good it's a very wonderful part of the wedding but not really the real deal right that is going to be only expensive three years and a half and then we shall go from heaven what happens usually after the wedding suffer has finished the the reception is finished what happens hallelujah hallelujah that is what happens after the reception now how the moon is a very special time why honeymoon is very special because it's only for the husband and the wife to rejoice together to be together to get to know one another hallelujah your mother is not there your father is not there you are already there too but hey there is something that happens you don't get to tell your wife uh they are not good for me food they are there's nothing for that there is someone else doing this is a honeymoon idea when you go on a honeymoon if you have your company you go somewhere you in a very luxurious hotel or something you know you're just there and you're being served hours they bring new ones you know at the house they scream the clothes yes wash everything everything is ready your wife is like someone who has never even known how to cook she's just there she's not just doing any work she is in her rest hallelujah at that time you have servants are you hearing me because it's a special time for her why they called it honey because a special time for it's just a sweet moment with your bride and groom and with jesus we are going to be with you in our honor and when shall we go in animal everything is lost then when we come in our honeymoon down here on earth why on earth by the way do you know that people you know you know when you're waiting you will be the one to choose depends on your budget and everything i know but you know you can say he can surprise you anyway he can surprise you and take you in a place that you ever dreamed to go to or you may ask say where i want to go here but i think this time our lord will surprise us this is the place where we have been being tormented this is the place where we have suffered this is the place where we have received all the body issues the bad things where they have school that you where they have laughed at you where you're being poor maybe you're suffering you're seeing people driving there because then you just look at that like that you know this is the place where you see somebody you know this is a place right he is intending to make us enjoy here at this very place and that by that time he would have conquered all the kingdoms of the world hallelujah he's going to conquer all of them conquer he's the mighty conqueror the bible says that all the kingdoms of the world will become the kingdom of our god jesus christ when is that time that is the time even of our animal because he conquers them and as he talks as he conquers them then he he comes down and the city comes down from heaven and then like instead of a city for swear and you know it would be a glorious a glamorous time agreement to look at very wonderful very great and we shall be in that city we shall be in that place and the 144 thousand will be with us there we shall be there they will be there why are they there because they are not supposed to suffer but they are servants our servants whereas we are the bride hallelujah at that time we are doing nothing hey we're just enjoying our time with our husband hallelujah say i'm not i'm saying the truth that's what the scripture tells us here amen hallelujah and then after our action the bible says when you read down here you will see that the bible says that you know of course one person asked me pastor i've been following what you have been saying one thing before the animal comes the third world war right what's the third one armageddon so before the millennium comes the armageddon and by the man says the armageddon destroys all all things so where will the people that we shall rule overcome from individuals which will survive i've always i don't know it's just our opinion i've always heard it to say that how would they survive the fires that really bad up the world atomic bombs and everything some of these rich people that you know have enough money they think they can go to the moon or they think they can be with bankers you know bankers how many bankers deep down in the crust of the earth whereby uh even if they hit an atomic bomb or something or a nuclear bomb it can't go through they are protected so some of these people they will know that hey now it is a bad moment let us escape they will escape they would leave these zero groups to monday whatever for them they would escape they were going to the bankers and they haven't even acted the movies out of those things then they will come out when the earth is completely the sea they will not play so quickly but they will not know that there is a let me call it this way aliens that look over there they will not know that there was there is another race and other people that actually now all in the world and you know who those people will be they will be having a different body even if you box it your hand just goes through maybe yeah one person will be there digging maybe then they will come here maybe some of these religions i don't want to mention their name this word known people they will apply that god will make sure that these rich ones they will be not only the second half but we shall also rule over them it will be they also reproduce and then the medical election will come now there will be visas and then did you touch it when i wanted to touch it disappeared really you were joking then the father said they will be saved finally there is a city it's a very big city which is looking so glamorous viewed with wars out of this world with a technology that has never been seen and then they would say where can these things come from they couldn't they would just leave they said this thing we cannot we don't know just wait let us go let us stick with this present episode one and then one day it is in this chapter after the end of the 1000 years the bible says that the devil will be losed remember for a seven years the devil was bound by the end of a thousand years the devil will be lost and when he's lost where would he go he has to find a vessel for you you know that there is not a vessel see if all of us refuse the devil to use us you know he's going to be part of the samanas yes suddenly that some of you cooperated with the devil so much that's a very weak guy very weak very weak friend when he comes out of the bottomless pit all the demons yes where can we go then you will find those those rich guys there of course they were rich in the other ones not in this one those prisons they are not prisoners say the bible tells me that fire from from heaven will come down hallelujah and it will abandon up all of them finish them up in a minute now what am i going to do now and before they ever lose it i began that will catch him now this is your last moment you had your chance that time the level is going to be finished we wanted the reddit the beast the dragon and the false prophet it's time your time now to go and now i'm going to the bottom right and not in the brothers but in the lake of fire give me that chapter you will see it's so amazing i tell you hallelujah and after that time they will be throughout the lake of fire another fire will be there for how long it will be there for as long as as long as god wants and then of course he will do away with it chapter 21 says behold i swear new heaven and the new earth the new heaven and the new earth did not have hair hallelujah and and laid hold on the dragon that all suffered which is the devil and suddenly and bound him a thousand years okay and he cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seer upon him that he should receive the nations no more until the thousand years should be fulfilled you have seen that party and after that he must be used a little season when is that little season the one i told you about that of gogan here's what it is and they saw surrounded and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and with which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads oh in their hands and they leave them reigned with christ i don't know your people but me where would you be but the rest of the day lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection we notice that a thousand years will be finished and then we shall have another mass resurrection for all people who have died they were right all those who are in hell whatever they will come up they will come out to face the wrath and him and he will be with you god bless you hallelujah he will do with his wife to judge the living and dead dead blessed and holy is he that had part in the first resurrection on such the second death has no power but they that they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years and when the thousand years are expired saturn shall not be loosed out of his freedom of to gather them together to battle the number of mummies that's the sound of the city these are the ones i was telling you about when you read the other scriptures and you tie them together with this one you will see the story i was giving you tithe perfectly and they went up on the breadth of the earth and compassed the camp of the saints about the carbon compass around the beloved city and fire came down from god out of heaven and divided them think about it and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and grievously you see that the part where the beast and the first prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and and says forever and ever does not necessarily mean eternally it only means that it will be forever and ever and ever and ever until it says full stop get out and i saw a great white throne and he in the sun on it now you might say now where where will the white throne judgment be it's going to be at this moment after we have enjoyed it with him now he will say that's good worker now hey come back with us hey cover that's good what they were gonna would you like a living hand hmm and him that sat on it from whose face the after the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was open which is the book of life hallelujah right here with me which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their what and the city shall they still give them gave up the dead which were immediately and death and they have delivered up the day you see all those which were inherent it was time for them to come they have to come out to be giant they leave it up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell was cast into the lake of fire and that's the second we don't want to be that second date that's a very bad one now and whosoever wasn't found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire hallelujah and then verse 22 chapter 21 verse one says that i saw a new heaven and a new life for the first heaven and the first art war passed away and there was no more seat there was no more did you know that that even there was no more sun no more sea no more sun no there were many things we should not be there hallelujah and there will be you and he my god let us go back to the church anymore yo people i don't know i don't know about you i'm enjoying this hallelujah all right so we noticed that here the lack of fire which where the war and the children are killed the second death you now you know what we're talking about that's the second that happens there who is the war who is the one the war people speak up speaker the war is catholicism hallelujah that idea of not the people who were there right there were not catholics never said that but those ones some of them are even afraid they will come up okay i'm talking about catholicism as other media as an idea as a first doctrine as a first religion that really just forced religious system we are talking about the system whoever is listening to us not the people the system that first radio system is the wall she's the great prostitute she's the great one the mother of all of them that one and our children she has children and all her children are daughters she has no boy she's a woman and she gave birth to children only which are girls and remember a woman means judge therefore these children since she is a church her children are also churches tax systems that are teaching wrong doctrines why are they daughters because they came out of her and when they came out of her they organized like and when they organize like they become like everything is the same every document is the same every ideology is the same they stand by they start this thing they sat they said they make their own cruise they do something they they they you know they join their accounts of texas these ones everyone they sell free they believe the tribute they all believe the trinity so this war that children they will be killed in the second death by the way in the second day there will be no forgiveness so if you thought that you were going to survive well interrupted then you you you end up going in heaven somehow forget that let me tell you if you listen to this message and you don't make it in the rapture you you you are deceived by the music because you can't even be part of the foolish pages yes you can't even be part of the foolish version some people have had them say well let me be the best because if i fail at this point in the rapture i can be forgiven who told you do you even know that there is a full value footage but you will not even know that she's there the mother says that you know you you will tell them you were up to me you owed this to me and they would say why did we do that for you they will not even know some people these will be the people who will have good hearts naturally unless you are there they may even not be christians at all so my friend those people don't think that it is you you you are either the bride oh you are going in the wreck of fire some idea don't let me aim for that let me aim for the sun and this i will give the stars who told you it will not work in this case you are you are either the bride or you are going to hell praise the lord but i believe i'm the bride i'm not scaring you don't feel bad hallelujah what i'm saying mean what you believe because you're not born to go to hell and neither are you going to be a free dragon you are born to be a son and a daughter of god so there it is today we are ending on the on the on the introduction only but i think it's okay by the way did you know that cyber was the ass astound that jezebel was priest priestess to and caused israel to stumble by the president's rights that she conducted so you see that cyber was a goddess a goddess jezebel was watching simon as well so you see this goddess today we have it in the form of mary the mother of god this is this is idolatry i doubt that's what it is idolatry it's the same same thing of all so whenever you see you don't think it is something new it is not new it has been there from the very beginning and the bible speaks a bit very very well so let's uh go a little bit in the edge and the introduction part here then we shall leave the rest for another meeting the sardisian or fifth church it is usually called the age of the reformation the messenger the messenger to this age is the best known messenger of all the ages he was martin luther martin luther was a brilliant scholar of gentle disposition he was studying to be a lawyer when the lingering illness and death of a near friend caused him to become serious concerning the spiritual condition of his life he entered the augustinian convented effort in 1505 there he studied philosophy and also the word of god he lived the life of severest penance but all the outward acts could not banish his sense of sin he said i tormented myself to death to make peace with god but i was in darkness and found it not the vicar general of his order staupitz helped him to gain the insight that his salvation would have to be the experience of an inner work rather than a ritual with this encouragement he further sought god later he became a priest as yet he was not saved he became an avid and deep student of the word and of the great theological works extent he was sought out as a teacher and preacher for his depth of knowledge and great sincerity to fulfill a vow he had made to himself he went to rome there he saw the futility of the church's imposed works that were to bring salvation and the word of god struck home to his heart the just shall live by faith on his return home the evangelical truth of this scripture flooded his mind and he was set free from sin and born into the kingdom of god soon after this he was elevated to doctor of divinity and commissioned to devote his whole life to study and faithfully expound and defend the holy scripture this he did and with such effect that his heart and the hearts of those around him were deeply fixed upon the truth of the word the word soon came into open conflict with the abuses of church creeds and doctrines thus when leo the tenth became pope and john tetzel came to sell indulgences for sin luther had no choice but to rise up against this anti-scriptural teaching first he thundered from the pulpit against it and then wrote his famous ninety five theses which on october thirty first fifteen seventeen he nailed to the door of castle church all right that part there that paragraph is also a very good one for us to look at so leo the letters sometimes i read them for you here do it as a martin luther king i don't know if some of you remember that i've read for you several times all those letters there's a leon the 10th was a pop at that time and john teselle john tesla everybody said john tells them so he started to sell indulgences for see do you know what an indulgence is yes sister you have an idea what is it speak loudly yeah something like that but you have to explain it very well you see they put together a list of things they just let's say a piece of paper and in this piece of paper it was commissioned from rome and it was said to all the people that are going to be all that desire that seems to be forgiven john tesla was working on behalf of pope leo and rome and he said anyone who wants their seeds to be forgiven should simply buy that piece of scrub or paper let's say that this is the paper and they say they read he read for them said whosoever wants their sins to be forgiven should buy in the name of the church i mean and in the name of popular over the term you should buy this piece of indulgence and the scenes you know they used to depends you know what penis is do you know what penises anyone knows no custeras you you wanted to be a catholic sister so tell us what is sometimes they would be difficult to do many things which were very difficult for them to do like meeting themselves in time by the time they leave even their skin is broken yeah by the way those catholics they're very sincere people very sincere it's not like they said god and they beat yourself and then you don't do it you dare not do that whatever they tell you to do you do it very well so they wanted to say now it is a new thing you only buy this piece of paper and once you buy the sales you have committed and those that you have you are committing now i know that you're planning to commit in the future are all forgiven whosoever that has bought this indulgence will not need to do penance anymore whosoever has done this no problem in the name of the church and in the name of the pope out the tent then people would say but the thing was expensive 30 million bring five brave people [Music] became so rich from those things it was meant to make the church the system rich but also to take people to help because imagine if you're trolling like that you only buy this one because remember the pope is the one those people behalf of christ so whatever it is that he says it is done so but the one who says yeah and john tesla came to sell indulgences for sin luther had no choice but to rise up against this anti-scriptural teachings remember ludha was already a priest in this same church as we are very very high first he thundered from the pulpit against and things that are wrong not just to stand for them and you know play it around and fear to speak when i preach about this mr peace it means uh i wanted to mention yes unfortunately you will feel bad oh oh oh brother you know joel will hate me let me tell you about the cold man don't fear those things as long as this is the word you thunder and so this man found that on the pulpit against this and the scripture teaching first he farted from the pulpit against the street and then he wrote and then he wrote his famous 95 is neither five pesos was like 95 reasons or or a list of things that the church had done wrong and why he was exiting it he put it on a paper and he said this is the reason why which on october the 1st 1517 he nailed to the door of the castle church all right that was amazing it wasn't it in a short time germany was ablaze and the reformation was on now let it be remembered that martin luther was not the only one who had protested the roman catholic church he was but one of many others had denied the popes their self-granted temporal and spiritual power and even amongst the popes there were minor temporary reforms yes there were many others by the way like he said that was not the only there were others there was actually john wickliffe said something when they were going to burn him he said you are kidding me now but 100 years from now there is going to come someone that you'll not be able to kill and it was martin luther one of exactly 100 years later he came on the scene and he started the defamation movement and they couldn't kill one of their own oh my god lord because rules are people on the left rule that were the ones burning people but now he is the one going on the side of the back of the ones going to be banned and they burned him they couldn't have banned him because he was a general manager they wouldn't sign him because they were saying they don't know the scripture and they are above yahweh they are like preaching headaches but this is one of their own they are betrayed beliefs everything you say is from the convict so how can you now tell us that you abandoned him because of heresy so which means the church itself is heretic they did not touch him raised issues but in the case of luther god's time was ripe for a definite move that would be the beginning of the restoration of the church to an outpouring of the holy ghost at a much later date now martin luther himself was a sensitive spirit-filled christian he was definitely a man of the word for he not only had a profound passion to study it but to make it available to all in order that all might live by it he translated the new testament and gave it to the people this laborious work he did himself correcting a passage as much as twenty times he gathered around him a group of hebrew scholars amongst whom were jews and translated the old testament this monumental work of luther is still the work upon which all successive works of the scripture in germany have rested he was a mighty preacher and teacher of the word and insisted especially in his first years of public eminence that the word was the soul criterion thus he was against works as a means of salvation and baptism as a means of regeneration he taught the mediation of christ apart from man as was the original and did you know that the first bible to be translated properly was in germany in german in german in germany the only reason why we don't read the german translation is obvious because we don't read yemen and the only reason why that's that translation was not the one translated it's because yemen was not the one which colonized the whole world it was written and of course this movement of luda was also starting to eat up england and a man who translated the english version was william tinder william tinder was a man that was accused of heresy and they said he's following buddha this is that we are reading now about so that's why they say ah he is following he is network and they will take him now they are coming they can't escape they fight when he is ready to go ah he goes to another place he continues his work imagine and finally his own person betrayed you and they banned he died but he did not die in vain then we have the kgb version this bible you know what is called king james version sometimes we have things that we don't know why say the names of all these cars is the names of people there it is the name of a person they including these other cars toyota the name of a person therefore king james version don't just think it is just something which came from heaven they were the king museums james is a king he was a king of great britain the king of england rather and he was the one who authorized read this thing open your kingdom smashing this is the only bible containing the older new testament authorized king james version have you seen that why is it authorized at that time you would not read any bible they were only support no one was ever allowed to read the bibles but in england when this man after his death he james i think one of his wives or someone was reading and following this man so he told him after all his writings were not healthy so why if they are not heretic why has it not been a published decision because the united states said i don't care as long as no heroes is found in it published in all the churches in england and in every church in england you are missing out on a very important point i'm giving you strong history here now in every church in england on the pool bridge there was a very large version of it like this one yeah there was a very large version of this black kingdom's version bible like this one peeled on the church on the church pulpit always there when the priest comes and the preacher just opens like that it was always there since i was threatened to be read all over england the king has spoken and ever since then of course you know england colonized most of the world so all of us who were under the domain of england received this version including here in uganda we read it today but this bible came by many people who sacrificed their blood and they died there are four the kgb is the right version because it survived fires wrong it survived you know you know all the brothers tomorrow just time it survived it it survived it in order for you and i to get it it is saying that william tender he will do print the bibles put them in how do they call these things these things of the uh the food of horses we don't know it here of course you don't even know what the sign will do so you would have put it there they can make a solid or whatever you would put those bibles there and they would buy you would transport them like that but sometimes the catholic church was the one buying it in these guys so what they would do they would buy it from him he sends it to them they burn it and they will buy a mass quantity so they kept it busy only to buy it and if you say you would sell to them but they would burn it but you would use that same money to produce more you produce that same money uh to produce more yeah so you would use that money to produce more bibles and those bibles that he produced he would sell again to them and he would get excuse me all right okay come back come back something happening here all right so i was saying that uh you would use that money to but to make more bibles they would buy they would use that monthly bible you understand until they gave up but he never gave up until he was killed but those bibles survived until we have them today hallelujah so these bibles came from very very far but the first translations of the bible were in german but it was also not very perfect i think william gina did a better job anyway uh but the first information the reformation started in german that's why even the missionaries the very very first missionaries here really many of them were from german you know because they received the move of god first he was a man given to much prayer and had learned that the more work he had to do and the more sorely he was pressed for time the more of his time he gave to god in prayer in order to ensure satisfactory results he knew what it was to battle with the devil and it is said that satan one day visibly appeared to him and he flung the ink well at him bidding him go another time two fanatics came to him to induce him to join with them in banishing all priests and bibles he discerned the spirit within them and sent them off it is recorded of dr martin luther in sours history volume 3 page 406 that he was a prophet evangelist speaker in tongues interpreter in one person endowed with all nine gifts of the spirit what stirred his heart and he didn't know that as much as he was endowed with all these gifts of the spirit he himself was not teaching the books of the holy spirit because he was only teaching once he was teaching rather faith he was sitting faith in christ but to fulfill the other part to fulfill the other part of the messenger you remember the the the pattern that god used or by the bottom used rather to determine what the messenger was in every generation what was that pattern number one yeah of course but that's not the pattern that's not the pattern there must be a pattern all through the edges that every messenger true messenger must have yes exactly like the fast yes paul was the first messenger and i was poor paul was a man of the world and paul was the man of the spirit as well so that pattern must be all through those messengers or at least one who was closest what paul had we can say in that generation he is the one you understand so here he brings in that idea that he was a man of the world but of course excuse me also he was a prophet he was an evangelist he was a speaker in tongues he's a preacher as a man who wasn't even you know knowing about the gift of the spirit like like we know you today the voicemail like we know it today he was interpreting town and speaking in tongues and you who is supposed to be the omega bride who knows much more than rude and him you can't even speak in times let alone laugh of those who are speaking them you'll feel sorry for yourself so he was a speaker in terms of the prayer he was he was endured with all nine spirit the gift of the spirit right you remember what i did for you on sunday uh on wednesday but i'm saying what's the lowest gift that there is the smallest gift whereby when you get you said now i've started it's the small one of the smaller it is smaller smallest you understand there are nice spiritual groups but there are none of this so by the way the course is major on it as if it is there real deal that's really not the real deal amen but that is not to say that you by the holy ghost and which was the little green chute that signified that truth was coming back to the church as it was known at pentecost was the doctrine of justification salvation by grace apart from works i recognize that dr luther did not believe only and preach only justification but that was his major theme as indeed it had to be for that is the basic doctrine of the truth of the word he will be forever known as the instrument in the hand of god who revived this truth he was the fifth messenger and his message was the just shall live by faith surely we admit that he knew and did teach that we are to go from faith to faith his marvelous understanding of sovereignty election predestination and other truths show him to be a great man in the word yet i say again as do historians god used him to bring to the people god's standard against works the just shall live by faith now as i mentioned already this age has been called by the historians the period of reformation that is exactly right that is what it was it had to be that for martin luther was a reformer not a prophet now i know the history book calls him a prophet but it doesn't mean that the history book is right for there is no record of martin luther qualifying as a true prophet of god in the grand scriptural sense of that word he was a fine teacher with some of the manifestations of the spirit in his life and we praise god for that so he was not able to lead the church back to the whole truth as would a man like the apostle paul who was both apostle and prophet now as time went on we find a great change in the way he conducted the affairs in which he was involved at first he had been so gentle so fearless so patient and constantly waiting on god to work out the problems but then vast numbers began to come to his banner their purpose was not a truly spiritual one rather they had political motivations they wanted to break the yoke of the pope they disliked sending money to rome fanatics rose up soon he was dragged into political affairs and decisions that actually lay outside the realm of the church except that the church through prayer preaching and conduct might set up a standard to be heated these problems of politics mounted until he was forced into an untenable position of mediating between lords and peasants his decisions were so wrong that an uprising took place and thousands were killed he meant well but once he had let himself be entangled again in a church state gospel he had to reap the whirlwind but for all that god used martin luther let it not be said that his intentions were wrong let it only be said that his judgment failed truly if the lutherans could get back to his teaching and serve god as this gracious brother served him then that people would surely be a credit and praise to the great god and savior jesus christ the salutation hallelujah i think we shall stop there for today is there anyone with a question yes i'm asking myself that i was martin luther king okay uh that why was martin luther not able to preach the whole truth yet the whole truth was in the bible because it was not yet the time for the whole truth to be preached just like you saw a seed you cannot say after two weeks why cut that old why can't that seed bear a wall grain yet the life is in it because it's not yet the time so that is times and there is seasons so we notice that the time of blood actually by the banana talks about it it talks about it as a plant has different parts of it you know there's the seed time then i'll put the transfer that they update for those things whatever personal person yeah the parts of the growth of uh that's a maze or or wheat there's the tassel that is there you don't know nothing and you're an agriculture so let me read for you what it says down here okay okay let me let me get this quote here for you and be able uh be able to read it out for you i'm sure it will be able to bless you answer your question okay let's prepare this give me some moment to find it okay okay i'm not getting it as i want it then with another question as i find this quote yes yes sister go ahead but man is a rubbish a lot of voice people call the messengers of the other the messengers of other church ages were they also vindicated can someone answer that question with explanation not just yes or no anyone who can answer that to answer that here then [Music] okay another brother who can do that you can also answer the more clarity for the system i think from the beginning i've been studying about messengers so that they all had the manifestation of the power of good but he's talking about the vindication like we can say can you first of all discuss on the vindications of the means of alabama and we discuss it when he was no she's not speaking to me she's speaking to all of us so i need us to have a discussion here so i want you to be active rather respond respond just run away that cloud that came the voice talked from heaven and say that as john the baptist was sent for under first coming so this one your message is for around the was on his head when they took his and paul was also vindicated with the beloved fire i think these are the only stages what do you say about that for me sent by god in their ages but the prophets we are seeing here where paul and brother branham yes your voices please make it big as we read it there's a certain church page hey try to end up they close the gates and the power of god can show that for this part of them i saw a kill when he prayed okay now we have uh been reading all the uh the things that we have been reading the message actually i don't know about each of you but from whatever we have been reading we have been reading i mean every age we have been reading the vindications of that message go back and read on every uh church age when he brings a messenger the next thing he does he brings the indication that prove that that message was the message not because he picked him but because there were certain things that were identical only to that messenger that made him stand out among the rest for example do you remember the messenger in the first age who was it i mean in the second age rather iranians and then they said iranians was the student of wu iranians was a student of politica and polycarp was a student of oh come on say it john so john is the honorable of the book of revelation according to you who should have been the true messenger of that age if we are to to see the one who was closest to the apostles who should have been john was the apostle john after john then polika polycarp was a student of the word of john but john and polycarp lived in a different generation thereafter right so we are looking after john who should have been the message why you were so close to john he learned from john you understand but here comes the prophet the spirit of god comes in him and he says yeah he betrays about political people was a great man of god god used him you know you know what he did and then he says what did he do what happened when did he pray for that yes so monica but why was that a messenger he was a man of god but it was not a vindicated message sister what is vindication vindication is something that happens in your life that proves you are who you say you are that vindication is in two ways sister one the word of god should be preached purely through your life and it should be lived also and number two there should be signs and one has to prove you are you say who you are you understand so in polycarp polycarp was having the manifestation right he was having the move of god in his life right he was a servant of god right you're not answering me yes yes but polycarp was leaning towards the organization ah elizabeth are you with us monica was leaning towards the organization and because he was leaning towards the organization the spirit of god rejects him as a messenger but recognizes him as one of them that god uses that generation you understand yes because the paul never leaned towards organization how come that another messenger would do it you understand for example the first messenger who was it poor why not peter was that he a servant of god but he was not a vindicated messenger for that generation why because peter we find that peter was one who did not even have a clear understanding of the word of the hour peter was thinking that everyone has to be circumcised like the jews peter was thinking the gospel is only for the jews then i will now preach among the gentiles his uncircumcised whatever christians peter was having that idea so even when god told him what preacher said what you mean i should be questioned shut up how can you call an agreement with us please so peter was not having a full revelation and understanding of the word of the heart of that hour but paul did so paul was vindicated not only because of the peer of fire don't look at medication as the supernatural only look at medication in many ways not many ways but two ways the full word of the hour number one and number two the supernatural so when you see in paul's life there was the supernatural just like it was in peter's life also people have a supernatural but when it comes to the full knowledge of the world of the day it was now all within when it comes to the second edge same thing the start edge same thing fourth same thing fifth same thing there were other men that god used not only much more but why does the holy spirit picked rudolph he had the full word of that generation the word of the hour when we said the word of the hour it means that it is more just like he said luther also preached faith that growing from faith to faith not only faith period but faith god god continues defeating himself further believed in that he knew what he had was little but he knew more was coming just like peter knew paul knew that more was coming he said actually even if it doesn't say the salvation shall be revealed so we see that each of these messengers we have vindicated messengers vindication is how the word of god the pure the word approaching it then the regression they received for that power for the question for that power like paul had it in the foundational way or not then when it comes to the others then also the other thing that they had was the supernatural so haven't we seen in every messenger something supernatural that was happening in their life and in their ministry system we didn't see that that is the vindication but we only know so much details about badapanam because it's in our generation but the others if you dig you can also find more but we don't want to go digging one by one being digging because that's not our generation we are in another generation just like martin luther preached very many good sermons have you listened to them have you ever listened to elements of your mother and you wonder why are we even calling him a messenger but if you dig them you'll find them like you join with it the one we are going to come to today the next day of philadelphia june weasley was a very good man and a very good servant of everybody very many good messages when we reach him i'll even tell you which message you should listen to very very good you see but we don't dig those things why because this is not our age we're in another age now hallelujah but for you to be perfected well you need to also know the other concepts of the other the messages of the other ages before us because we are the omega bride we are the ones finishing finishing it up yes concluded everyone with another question yes no question everything fine you have a question oh uh as we are concluding i rather ask the question i'd rather give you this quote from the leadership and i want to read this and then we shall uh we shall you you might need to listen to this whole message so you take note of it leadership says the first call of which the bridegroom had to fall into the earth in order to rise again when you when you when you saw a seed of wheat what happens to it it dies after it dies the germinates it grows after it grows but it must grow to maturity before i'm going to request those who are online to please mute mute yourself at all times okay so the first call of wheat now listen to this very well the first corner of wheat the bridegroom had to fall into the earth in order to rise again so the first bride that was born at pentecost he had to go through the darker ages like any other seed everybody you remember that that kind of pentecost it had to go to the ground i i think there is someone who is not muting i'll remove you so make sure that you you're muting yourself please so it says so did the first bride that was born at pentecost he had to go through that dark ages like any other seed everybody they have to die they must do it but it started sprouting again in ruler are you the seed was by that pentecost huh and it died and then they started sprouting again bring back a text i can't see look at what you see on your screen okay it says but it started sprouting again in luda in the first reformation that's where we are now that was the only the seed to begin to sprout to germinate do you expect to see the fruit that's why you cannot preach everything he continued to baptize the baptising babies he continued there because the seed is just sprouting in the first reformation it did not look like the seed that went in but it was the light of that day are you getting it the stalker then went on into the tassel that is the those things that come huh but the maze is like on the maze for example whizzy because the weasley the tassel i will show you a picture here when you see into the wheat when it comes forth the corner with a man that's raised weak you go out and see that wheat foam in there it just looks like exactly like the grain but it won't take a twist and sit down and take uh and take that week and open it up there is no green in there at all that was weasley now there was no grain it is just a shark and then what it is formed there to hold the grain and then the first thing you know the lights that the the life that left the stove to go into the tassel if you let the pasta to go in the shack it removes the shark and goes into the weight three stages see of it and then forms the wheat outside of the three stages luda weasley peters you're getting it now just exactly see no doubt you can't interrupt nature hallelujah and i i'm let me share this with you of uh the the wheat you know uh you can see that there since i don't ask the question can you see and uh you see that which for example here i have maze well it's an israel but it's the same as the uh the what what we are running here you see the seed is planted here dies and then goes through the stalk eh of course i'm talking about this is a maze but if it is a wheat the wheat will be up here not down here all right so the tassel this is the tassel it will be the castle out of the tassel then it will come what there will come the the shark after the shark because that is the shack but the shark then you produce the seed that's the seed now where are we we are at the time of the ripening of the seed where the seed is going to be now collected and garneted into into its place and the shack will be cut down and they will be bad hallelujah so we are at a time of the siege coming forth again that's why those people was not preaching all the doctrine in the right documents because that time i know they'd reach for the full seed for the full maturity of the seed to come we are now in the time of the full maturity of the same word of god to come back again and you are the reason why amen that one has come to mature you mature us amen we are here for the purpose of the maturity of the bride hallelujah this matter has not been seen anywhere else in the generations before us it is in our generation so we are that generation hallelujah so you see how much weight is on your assurance you're not just a believer you're not generation that it's going to symbol you eat you don't look like you are are you a brother you may not look like like you are but that's it this is the time that's it come forth and and bring forth the same seed which was planted in the ground when was that ground where was that ground that pentacles pentecost was that ground therefore the true church is that church which will bring forth not reproduce but bring forth the same thing which was at pentecost hallelujah not as a street no pentacles barker there because this is now the time of the sea to bring forth of its kind god bless you and we can stop there for today and we shall continue on friday next next week the road waiting for now you can stop there i'd like us to see a song as we close brother rather okay whichever you play
