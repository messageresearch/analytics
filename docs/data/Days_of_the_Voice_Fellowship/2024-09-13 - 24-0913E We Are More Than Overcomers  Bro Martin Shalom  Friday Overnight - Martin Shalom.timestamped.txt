[59:50] Overcomers blessed be the name of the
[59:52] Lord and I will depend on this very
[59:54] scripture
[59:57] we have
[59:58] read we are living in
[1:00:02] the
[1:00:04] time where
[1:00:06] we are fighting the battle amen but it's
[1:00:10] the Lord's battle it's not our battles
[1:00:13] because the Bible says that the battle
[1:00:15] is the Lord's amen and the Victory Is
[1:00:19] Ours blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:00:22] yeah so this night I just want us to
[1:00:26] remind ourselves that we are more than
[1:00:29] Overcomers amen we are more than
[1:00:34] Victorious blessed be the name of the
[1:00:36] Lord it pleased the
[1:00:39] Lord to choose us to fight the
[1:00:43] battle praise be to God you our Prophet
[1:00:46] tells us that this battle started in
[1:00:49] heaven and the devil was cast on
[1:00:53] Earth and still God did not leave the
[1:00:56] devil to come and torment us blessed be
[1:01:00] the name of the Lord but God had a plan
[1:01:03] before the foundation of the world that
[1:01:06] will come and engage the devil even on
[1:01:09] Earth praise be to
[1:01:11] God and we are the people chosen this
[1:01:15] generation we are the people
[1:01:18] elected we are the people ordained to
[1:01:20] fight this
[1:01:22] battle and if you think uh you are small
[1:01:26] I'm here to remind you that you are more
[1:01:28] than Overcomers blessed be the name of
[1:01:31] the Lord
[1:01:33] amen he says here that and all thy
[1:01:37] children shall be taught of the
[1:01:40] Lord and great shall be the Peace of thy
[1:01:45] children
[1:01:48] Amen in
[1:01:50] righteousness shall thou be
[1:01:54] established thou shall be far from
[1:01:57] operation blessed be the name of the
[1:01:59] Lord the word of God is telling us that
[1:02:02] we shall be far from operation from
[1:02:05] operation of the devil blessed be the
[1:02:08] name of the Lord amen he said that in
[1:02:11] righteousness the only way we can be
[1:02:14] established that
[1:02:24] is
[1:02:54] e e
[1:03:26] name of the Lord and this evening I'm
[1:03:28] here to remind you that brethren we are
[1:03:30] more than Overcomers last Wednesday we
[1:03:33] talking about it's not yet over amen
[1:03:36] that when we think that we are failing
[1:03:39] when the devil thought I remember one
[1:03:41] time Pastor preach and said when the
[1:03:42] devil thought that he had won amen
[1:03:45] praise be to God
[1:03:48] so most the time that's what the enemy
[1:03:51] thinks but the word is telling us that
[1:03:55] in
[1:03:56] righteousness shall we be
[1:04:00] established whosoever Shall Gather
[1:04:03] against
[1:04:05] me they shall fall
[1:04:09] amen the Lord will Smite him and say no
[1:04:13] that is formed against
[1:04:15] me you can put yourself as well shall
[1:04:20] prosper uh brother Bram says here that
[1:04:25] that I know this to be the
[1:04:28] truth I know people don't realize who
[1:04:33] you are every person in here can live
[1:04:38] above
[1:04:39] sin can live without
[1:04:43] sin
[1:04:45] amen live in God you will make mistakes
[1:04:50] but the blood of Christ will forgive you
[1:04:56] blessed be the name of the
[1:04:58] Lord I know that every people don't
[1:05:01] realize who you
[1:05:04] are and if God can help us know that
[1:05:08] tonight he says that we can live above
[1:05:11] sin we can live without sin and we can
[1:05:15] live in God and when we live above
[1:05:19] sin and we live without sin and we live
[1:05:23] without when we live in God we are more
[1:05:27] than
[1:05:28] Overcomers blessed be the name of the
[1:05:31] Lord because if we have those three we
[1:05:33] are more than Overcomers and if they
[1:05:36] only realize who you are you are Sons
[1:05:39] and Daughters of God hairs of the
[1:05:42] Kingdom right now we are Kings claiming
[1:05:46] your legal rights don't let Satan press
[1:05:50] anything on
[1:05:51] you blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:05:54] don't let s press even sleep on
[1:05:58] you because we are more than
[1:06:03] Overcomers praise be to God we are the
[1:06:06] army that the Lord has chose to fight
[1:06:09] and we are here to fight sin amen we are
[1:06:12] to fight the enemy with all his
[1:06:15] Devils blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:06:18] and we are all to live above
[1:06:21] sin and living above sin meaning living
[1:06:24] in the word walking according to the
[1:06:27] word of God blessed be the name of the
[1:06:29] Lord and that's why we have come here we
[1:06:32] have come to remind ourself above this
[1:06:35] word because the Bible tells us to
[1:06:37] confort one another with this word
[1:06:40] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:06:44] amen he said listen you are Covenant
[1:06:47] people of God and God tear Christ apart
[1:06:52] at Calvary making the Covenant an
[1:06:56] swearing by himself and he took the body
[1:06:59] up into heaven which will return Someday
[1:07:05] by the spirit he gave back to lead the
[1:07:09] church in the same life that was in
[1:07:12] Christ Jesus in the is in the church
[1:07:17] tonight by the Holy Ghost blessed be the
[1:07:21] name of the Lord we cannot overcome
[1:07:24] without the help of the Holy Spirit and
[1:07:28] that's why Jesus told them T
[1:07:31] ye on the upper room until you be
[1:07:34] endured with the power from above
[1:07:37] blessed be the name of the Lord and when
[1:07:39] that power comes in us there we become
[1:07:43] there that's when we are more than
[1:07:45] Overcomers because not be us fighting
[1:07:48] the battle but is Jesus in us fighting
[1:07:51] our battles blessed be the name of the
[1:07:54] Lord amen and what the church need
[1:07:57] tonight that's all that we need to
[1:07:59] realize that Jesus is here Jesus is back
[1:08:03] to lead the church again the Holy Ghost
[1:08:06] is here to lead the church to give us
[1:08:08] that Victory blessed be the name of the
[1:08:11] Lord we cannot be established in
[1:08:13] righteousness unless we have the portion
[1:08:16] of him praise be to God and when he the
[1:08:21] Holy Ghost is come that portion of
[1:08:24] Christ where he is in US
[1:08:26] that is our Victory praise be to God he
[1:08:29] said that men and women it is time that
[1:08:31] we found out who we are that the devil
[1:08:35] is trying to hide you back tell you that
[1:08:37] you are some little troed down something
[1:08:41] but you are not you are Sons and
[1:08:43] Daughters of God the deity is not in
[1:08:46] heaven but it is in you blessed be the
[1:08:50] name of the Lord he said that noon
[1:08:52] formed against us shall prosper
[1:08:55] and every tongue that shall rise against
[1:08:58] thee in judgment thou shall condemn it
[1:09:01] and this is the heritage of the Servants
[1:09:04] of the
[1:09:05] Lord our heritage is
[1:09:08] Victory blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:09:11] amen we have no promise of being
[1:09:14] overcome amen but we are more than
[1:09:17] Overcomers God gave us the promise in
[1:09:20] his word blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:09:22] whether you living in sin or whether
[1:09:25] you're living a defeated life you ought
[1:09:27] not to live a defeated life because the
[1:09:30] promise we have in the word of God is to
[1:09:32] live above sin to live a Victorious Life
[1:09:36] blessed be the name of the Lord that is
[1:09:38] what God has given us in this
[1:09:41] generation and he has made it more clear
[1:09:44] To
[1:09:45] Us by sending us Malachi
[1:09:48] 4 when we used to when we in still in
[1:09:52] Pentecostal when someone corrects you
[1:09:59] it's so
[1:10:01] beautiful you know as a Christian we
[1:10:04] ought to live an life of
[1:10:09] example but sometime you do something
[1:10:13] which is contrary to what you
[1:10:15] believe and when someone comes to
[1:10:18] correct you I remember those
[1:10:23] days uh I I think I've I said it once
[1:10:27] one time many years back but I heard it
[1:10:30] from someone who was an
[1:10:34] elder when someone say but Salvation is
[1:10:38] not purchased by man you can also buy
[1:10:40] you can also go get one blessed be the
[1:10:43] name of the
[1:10:48] Lord but when we come this side is
[1:10:51] different story our Prophet tells us
[1:10:54] that we should live the gospel than
[1:10:57] preaching blessed be the name of the
[1:10:59] Lord It's a mandate for every
[1:11:02] Christian to live a life of an example
[1:11:06] blessed be the name of the Lord where
[1:11:09] while it looks
[1:11:10] hard but when God by the hope of the
[1:11:14] Holy Spirit it is very possible praise
[1:11:17] be to God
[1:11:20] amen amen
[1:11:25] praise the
[1:11:26] Lord so here he tells
[1:11:29] us that noon formed against us shall
[1:11:34] prosper God has given us his
[1:11:38] word and he expect us to live a
[1:11:41] Victorious Life praise be to God Christ
[1:11:46] when he rose from the dead in the
[1:11:48] message that on Calvary braam tells us
[1:11:51] that on that day on Calvary every sin
[1:11:55] question was settled there and today
[1:11:59] even when we are living below our
[1:12:01] privileges we ought to look back and see
[1:12:05] what Jesus did on Calvary amen our
[1:12:08] strength is on Calvary and the devil's
[1:12:11] weakness is also on Calvary because when
[1:12:14] he looks there he remembers what
[1:12:17] happened to him amen and that's why
[1:12:20] brother bam says that a Christian should
[1:12:23] never forget Calvary we should remember
[1:12:26] Calvary always in our life because that
[1:12:29] is where our Victory is blessed be the
[1:12:32] name of the Lord when I'm weak I will
[1:12:34] look at Calvary where jesus carried my
[1:12:37] sin when I'm defeated I will look unto
[1:12:40] Calvary and remember that Jesus died and
[1:12:44] rose again blessed be the name of the
[1:12:46] Lord when I'm sick I will look un
[1:12:49] Calvary and remember that by his stripes
[1:12:52] I am healed blessed be the name name of
[1:12:55] the Lord that's why it's a mandate for
[1:12:57] us to remember Calvary in every days of
[1:13:00] our life blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:13:03] butam say that when we repent of our
[1:13:07] sin the blood of Jesus breaks that sin
[1:13:11] amen it's like a Clorox he say it's like
[1:13:14] a Clorox or call it as like a j that
[1:13:18] When sin is thrown in the blood of Jesus
[1:13:22] the blood of Jesus will break it and
[1:13:24] make take it and take it back Amen to
[1:13:27] its origin where it came from and you
[1:13:30] know what we all know that the devil is
[1:13:33] the origin of sin blessed be the name of
[1:13:35] the Lord so when we repent our sins and
[1:13:38] our sins is in the blood of Jesus we are
[1:13:42] sinless and when we are sinless we are
[1:13:46] Overcomers blessed be the name of the
[1:13:48] Lord amen and that's why he say that
[1:13:51] noon formed against Earth shall prosper
[1:13:54] there are many many weapons amen there
[1:13:57] are many things there are many devices
[1:14:00] of the devil there are many ways that
[1:14:04] the enemy fights us but our one target
[1:14:08] or our one ambition is to
[1:14:11] look unto the Lord Jesus Christ blessed
[1:14:14] be the name of the Lord he said but let
[1:14:17] me uh he said let me tell you something
[1:14:19] brother when you realize that almighty
[1:14:21] God Lives in You Immortal Life my life I
[1:14:26] give you Zoe the life of God is in human
[1:14:30] being amen what I'm trying to do is to
[1:14:34] get to the Pentecostal people to let
[1:14:37] them
[1:14:40] realize who they
[1:14:43] are of Faith
[1:14:46] through here till they all to
[1:14:50] be

[1:14:55] Faith they realize who who they
[1:15:00] are that they of Faith here till it
[1:15:04] wouldn't be a sick person that would be
[1:15:07] in need of having a prayer line if the
[1:15:10] people that is here realize who they are

[1:24:54] amen he said we shall be an invisible
[1:24:58] Army praise the

[1:26:13] questioned indeed to human mind they may
[1:26:16] not even seems to qualify nevertheless
[1:26:20] they are the messenger for their age God
[1:26:23] is
[1:26:24] Abraham he lied he used Moses he
[1:26:29] rebelled he used the Jonah he disobeyed
[1:26:32] he used Samson he sinned David he
[1:26:36] murdered he used Joshua and Joseph and
[1:26:40] those with surve blam for out far
[1:26:44] outnumbered those whose history seems to
[1:26:47] be perfect and all we are and are is
[1:26:51] none dare deny that he used them by and
[1:26:57] through the holy spirit that he put
[1:26:59] within
[1:27:01] them praise be to God when God put his
[1:27:04] holy spirit within you it is the Holy
[1:27:07] Ghost doing the work in you that's why
[1:27:11] we must receive the Holy
[1:27:14] Spirit that's why we must receive the
[1:27:17] Holy Spirit blessed be the name of the
[1:27:19] Lord amen so my brethren
[1:27:30] I wonder how many of us go to the
[1:27:32] hospital to check on the sick and pray
[1:27:35] for
[1:27:37] them praise be to
[1:27:40] God because the sun shall follow the sun
[1:27:42] will not come at your home I say I've
[1:27:45] come to follow you my
[1:27:48] brother you must trigger
[1:27:50] it amen God has put all the potential in
[1:27:55] us but we must do something to trigger
[1:27:58] these
[1:28:00] potentials when God was still
[1:28:03] Elohim in him was
[1:28:06] redemption in him was
[1:28:09] healing in him was Deliverance amen he
[1:28:13] was a Healer he's still a Healer is even
[1:28:16] he's still a Healer today blessed be the
[1:28:19] name of the
[1:28:20] Lord but when God was still living alone
[1:28:24] those attribute were not manifested
[1:28:27] praise be to God but there came a time
[1:28:30] when this attribute must be
[1:28:32] manifested praise the Lord Adam had to
[1:28:36] fall for God to manifest the Redemption
[1:28:40] ability blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:28:43] but when we just sit and relaxa
[1:29:10] he had something substantial something
[1:29:13] was clinging
[1:29:14] to the reason that's why sometime we are
[1:29:17] drifted is because we have never had any
[1:29:20] experience with God apart from clapping
[1:29:23] hands in church
[1:29:26] but my brother my sister there is a time
[1:29:29] when you're are going to be squeezed at
[1:29:31] the corner
[1:29:32] somewhere where only what will make you
[1:29:35] go through or believe God that God will
[1:29:37] bring you out is what the Lord has
[1:29:40] helped you to go
[1:29:42] through blessed be the name of the
[1:29:45] Lord so each one of us we need that
[1:29:48] experience
[1:29:56] praise be to
[1:29:57] God very many people are being toasted
[1:30:00] and drifted here and there they run with
[1:30:03] two Lords four Lords what it is still
[1:30:07] the where the problem is is because they
[1:30:10] have never met that
[1:30:13] God that's why when someone comes with
[1:30:15] huge money ah he says
[1:30:24] why he has not got an
[1:30:30] experience and after we start growing
[1:30:34] there's nothing we can do as far as we
[1:30:36] are our well-being is
[1:30:39] concerned but God gives us the grace
[1:30:43] little by little amen the way you are
[1:30:46] this year I believe you're not it's not
[1:30:48] the way you were last year the way you
[1:30:51] were last month is not the way you are
[1:30:53] today
[1:30:54] because the Bible tells us that we are
[1:30:56] moving from glory to glory From Grace to
[1:31:02] Grace praise be to
[1:31:06] God and we all to check
[1:31:10] ourself we are bound to examine
[1:31:14] ourselves am I growing or
[1:31:17] not are we overcoming or not praise be
[1:31:21] to God
[1:31:24] because every day gone that day will
[1:31:27] never come
[1:31:28] back when the seed is planted in the
[1:31:31] ground that seed when it the moment it
[1:31:34] germinate it will start growing going
[1:31:39] upwardly praise be to God and even
[1:31:42] farmers will be so concerned to do the
[1:31:45] follow up
[1:32:00] them they become like a weed praise be
[1:32:04] to
[1:32:05] God but my prayer and My Cry is that God
[1:32:09] let me be the right
[1:32:11] seed let me grow at your
[1:32:14] pace amen sometime we don't want to grow
[1:32:18] at God's
[1:32:20] place we want to be God's grandchildren
[1:32:25] praise be to God but God called us to be
[1:32:28] more than
[1:32:29] conquerors he has given us all the
[1:32:32] protection and he says for your sake a
[1:32:35] thousand will fall for your
[1:32:39] sake they will rise against but they
[1:32:42] will not even come near
[1:32:44] you praise be to God and in
[1:32:47] righteousness shall we be established
[1:32:55] no weapon formed against you talk of
[1:32:58] those weapons no
[1:33:00] fornication no blast no
[1:33:04] babing no theft no witchcraft no
[1:33:09] murderer no
[1:33:11] backsliding amen God never call us to
[1:33:15] backslide no
[1:33:18] sir that's why we don't need to worry
[1:33:20] whether you're going to backslide
[1:33:22] tomorrow and
[1:33:31] you are saved
[1:33:36] brother you are
[1:33:38] liar faith is unconscious
[1:34:01] and they went there to
[1:34:07] attack before they realize they were
[1:34:10] naked and
[1:34:17] running praise be to God because when
[1:34:20] they confronted the guy they told him
[1:34:22] that we are chasing the name of Jesus
[1:34:24] whom Paul
[1:34:26] Paul cast then the man said that but
[1:34:30] Paul we know him he always gives us that
[1:34:34] time but who are
[1:34:41] you that's what happened to
[1:34:43] them but for us we know that we are
[1:34:46] children of God if you doubt that that's
[1:34:48] up to you but I know I'm a Child of
[1:34:51] God but but the other day yes that day
[1:34:54] but I am a child of
[1:34:58] God but sister we had that so yes you
[1:35:01] are but I'm a Child of
[1:35:08] God the other day took some so and so
[1:35:11] whatever brother it is
[1:35:14] true but I never sign agreement with God
[1:35:19] that when this happen I'm no longer your
[1:35:20] child
[1:35:33] praise be to God let the devil not lie
[1:35:38] you because you ate Daddy's sugar and
[1:35:42] the Devil comes and Whisper to you he's
[1:35:44] no longer your father he hates you tell
[1:35:47] the devil it is Daddy's
[1:35:51] sugar praise be to God
[1:35:54] because you ate Daddy's meat the enemy
[1:35:57] can't say you know
[1:35:58] what it's no longer your dad it's
[1:36:02] Daddy's
[1:36:03] meat the blood of Jesus will never lose
[1:36:06] it power until all the ransom Church of
[1:36:11] God until all of them are saved to sin
[1:36:14] no
[1:36:15] more as long as the bride is still here
[1:36:19] the blood of Jesus is still active
[1:36:23] praise be to God I don't believe that
[1:36:26] our genuine Christian will sin
[1:36:29] willfully but you will be Tred but let
[1:36:32] me tell you that blood is still
[1:36:35] active it is still working on you
[1:36:39] amen but when I'm tell this body is not
[1:36:43] saved but he will be saved in the
[1:36:45] twinkling of an
[1:36:47] eye praise be to God but there's a inner
[1:36:51] man we carry amen is the one who is
[1:36:54] saved is the one who pleads every time
[1:36:58] he crying that's why the Bible says that
[1:37:01] our spirit praise be to God Amen it's
[1:37:05] Christ Our Father our spirit with his
[1:37:07] Spirit blessed be the name of the
[1:37:12] Lord so let us look at what God did for
[1:37:15] us let us look at the ability of God the
[1:37:20] grace of God in our life
[1:37:26] even when your brother Strays help him
[1:37:28] to
[1:37:30] rise let us not TR our brother
[1:37:37] say who told you brother we haven't
[1:37:40] reached the Finishing Line amen but
[1:37:43] you're running the race toward the
[1:37:45] Finishing Line how sure are you don't be
[1:37:48] surprised when that brother will enter
[1:37:51] fast
[1:37:54] there's a children story of the T and
[1:37:57] the
[1:37:59] ha the ha knew that he's a very first
[1:38:01] animal amen but one day the T I stole
[1:38:05] the hair that you know I want overtake
[1:38:08] in the race and the guy laughed and
[1:38:12] laughed and
[1:38:14] laughed I said Hey in the
[1:38:18] race Mr to was so comfortable yes
[1:38:23] blessed be the name of the
[1:38:25] Lord so one day I believe you already
[1:38:28] know the story I'm talking about they
[1:38:31] went for the
[1:38:33] race and this man was even sleeping when
[1:38:35] the to I
[1:38:38] started and then all of a sudden he came
[1:38:41] out like a lightening at a lightening
[1:38:44] speed and Mr T was comfortable blessed
[1:38:48] be the name of the Lord Mr T was feeding
[1:38:51] on the word and Mr T no he knew that the
[1:38:56] rest is not for the Swift amen praise be
[1:39:00] to God so the man was so comfortable he
[1:39:04] had his faith amen and Mr ha thought or
[1:39:08] knew that the race was for the Swift
[1:39:31] finishing
[1:39:37] L that's why the Bible tell us let us
[1:39:40] lay aside every sin every weight of that
[1:39:44] do easily beset us let us run the rest
[1:39:47] with pacience amen looking unto Jesus
[1:39:50] amen Mr a looked at his ability Mr toas
[1:39:54] look at the he looked at the Finishing
[1:39:56] Line praise be to
[1:39:59] God Finishing
[1:40:02] Line so my brethren as we are running in
[1:40:05] this race there are many enting things
[1:40:08] of the world but let us not be
[1:40:10] distracted by the things of the world

[1:40:15] word let us run with the word we are
[1:40:19] more than Overcomers blessed be the name
[1:40:21] of the Lord we are we are more than
[1:40:24] conquerors Jesus fought for us
[1:40:28] amen even when things seems not to be
[1:40:32] working out let us wait on
[1:40:36] God because at least we have something
[1:40:38] that the world does not have when Jesus
[1:40:41] went the grave of Lazarus one of the
[1:40:44] sister one of the Lazarus sister knew
[1:40:47] that Jesus had something special in him
[1:40:50] he said Master if you were here my
[1:40:53] brother would not die but even now amen
[1:40:58] that is what the believer has but even
[1:41:01] now Lord amen though the stuation the
[1:41:04] condition has gone B but even
[1:41:07] now we know that when you pray God will
[1:41:11] answer when you pray God will hear amen

[1:41:25] Chang in fact that changed
[1:41:28] everything when said roll a weather
[1:41:31] Stone blessed be the name of the Lord so

[1:42:29] God God called us for a
[1:42:32] purpose there are better people and
[1:42:34] smart people in the
[1:42:36] world but God left them and came for you
[1:42:41] in your
[1:42:42] weakness in you in fact God knows very
[1:42:45] well the Habit you are fighting with
[1:42:47] today he knows that every now you try
[1:42:50] and again you fail but let me tell you
[1:42:53] there is a point where that answer
[1:42:56] is amen God is waiting for you at that
[1:42:59] corner where that habit will never
[1:43:02] disturb you
[1:43:05] anymore praise be to God many time
[1:43:08] message Believers want we want to live
[1:43:10] like angels
[1:43:23] brother
[1:43:34] forgetful it's only God blessed be the
[1:43:37] name of the Lord but let me tell you if
[1:43:40] you don't have those like uh if you
[1:43:42] don't have that kind of background you
[1:43:44] will not know the grace of God in your
[1:43:48] life but today when you look at someone
[1:43:51] who is big pocketing
[1:43:53] others you remember where that Grace
[1:43:57] dragged you from amen and you will lift
[1:44:01] your hands and thank god with even tears
[1:44:04] that God I thank you because I was once
[1:44:07] like that fell but that Grace found me
[1:44:11] amen and today I'm living a Victorious
[1:44:15] Life each one of us we
[1:44:18] have down our ups and down
[1:44:23] including our parents they have their
[1:44:25] ups and
[1:44:27] down but God never told us to look at
[1:44:29] those ups and down when he looked at us
[1:44:33] he see more than conquerors when God
[1:44:36] looked at he see Overcomers amen and
[1:44:40] even right now he's seeing bunch of
[1:44:42] Overcomers seated
[1:44:45] here because that's what he called us
[1:44:48] for blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[1:44:57] but what I'm say that in commentary was
[1:44:59] written and when Paul wrote Abram's
[1:45:01] commentary he never mentioned one thing
[1:45:03] about Abram's unbelief no no no never
[1:45:06] was even accounted to him he said
[1:45:10] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[1:45:12] God through unbelief but was strong
[1:45:16] giving praise to God
[1:45:18] Amen so my brothers and my sisters let
[1:45:23] us be strong
[1:45:27] amen keep giving praises to
[1:45:47] God brother just keep giving praise to
[1:45:51] God
[1:46:03] multiple
[1:46:06] times winners never
[1:46:09] quit and quits they don't win
[1:46:36] amen
[1:46:56] even in the
[1:46:58] grave he is Lord even in sickness he is
[1:47:03] Lord of Lord over that sickness even
[1:47:06] when we are broke he is Lord over that
[1:47:08] Brokenness even when we are rejected he
[1:47:11] is Lord over that because we are more
[1:47:14] than Overcomers praise be to God we are
[1:47:17] more than conquerors and we are living
[1:47:20] in the generation where which we are
[1:47:23] living the time when we have the
[1:47:25] revealed word of the
[1:47:28] hour and when we are talking about this
[1:47:30] we know it very well that's
[1:47:51] why for
[1:48:19] [Applause]
[1:48:40] we have to fight amen and we are
[1:48:43] fighting with the
[1:48:45] demons we are fighting serious
[1:48:49] battles blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:48:52] so friends let us cast out demons
[1:49:33] however there are
[1:49:35] cases when God can reveal it to you but
[1:49:40] brother Dixon is sick and you want First
[1:49:42] Vision to pray for
[1:49:48] him blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:50:11] ever been with
[1:50:51] AB
[1:51:07] we will not have terrorist in the
[1:51:11] world we not have Al shababs in the
[1:51:16] world praise be to God we would be
[1:51:19] enjoying
[1:51:28] they so excited with what they
[1:51:32] believe the God who only knows
[1:51:50] Arabic you
[1:52:03] Jesus is Worthy to be glorified he
[1:52:07] worthy to be praised it's worth to be
[1:52:09] shouted just
[1:52:13] Jesus because even when we just shout
[1:52:17] Jesus demons they like What's Happening
[1:52:20] Here
[1:52:26] amen because we are more than Overcomers
[1:52:59] we are more than
[1:53:01] Overcomers we are more than
[1:53:03] conquerors when Jesus went in Hell
[1:53:07] remember Lucifer fell with a third of
[1:53:09] angels but one Jesus when he went in the
[1:53:13] grave my brother my sister demons had to
[1:53:16] look for holes to
[1:53:20] flee Satan
[1:53:44] is just a spirit the devil is
[1:53:46] weak so the devil has to look for a body
[1:53:50] whether it's of human being or whether
[1:53:51] it's that devil manifest in many
[1:53:56] ways blessed be the name of the Lord I
[1:53:59] remember one time we living in bua
[1:54:02] island and there was one man he say that
[1:54:05] it was in the afternoon he had somebody
[1:54:07] knocking at his door when he
[1:54:11] came to see was
[1:54:13] knocking he found an animal I think was
[1:54:16] was about a cat something of that kind
[1:54:18] but had a human voice and and from there
[1:54:21] the man fell down was unconscious he's
[1:54:24] dying so the
[1:54:28] demon
[1:54:33] Satan that's why when you backl the
[1:54:35] devil will use you to do things which
[1:54:37] you will not even
[1:54:40] imagine just imagine someone goes before
[1:54:43] the camera and recalls himself as of
[1:54:47] naked that's what the devil is doing
[1:54:53] because he must get a body to operate
[1:54:56] in and the same when God is not in the
[1:55:00] body God is
[1:55:02] weak but when God gets the vessel to use
[1:55:05] amen one Samson s a thousands of
[1:55:09] philis Amen because there was one man
[1:55:13] who healed his body his soul to be used
[1:55:16] by God and that's what God want even
[1:55:18] today
[1:55:26] and that's why it pleased him to put on
[1:55:28] flesh and come and dwell Among
[1:55:32] Us so friends we are more than
[1:55:35] Overcomers even when you at school just
[1:55:38] know
[1:55:39] that I went through school by the grace
[1:55:42] of God I never messed up I went to
[1:55:46] campus and never messed up blessed be
[1:55:49] the name of the Lord what was that the
[1:55:51] grace of God God is more than
[1:55:54] conqueror we've been Bewitched I don't
[1:55:56] know how many time but none of us have
[1:55:59] been affected by
[1:56:01] witchcraft we have been
[1:56:03] intimidated multiple times but none of
[1:56:07] those things have ever happened to us
[1:56:10] why because we are more than conqueror
[1:56:13] in Christ Jesus and now we been formed
[1:56:16] against as shall
[1:56:19] prosper my father worked for the forces
[1:56:23] until he retired last year but for all
[1:56:25] his
[1:56:27] life in forces there's no man that has
[1:56:31] ever Rose against
[1:56:34] him who lived un punished
[1:56:38] life others lost their
[1:56:41] lives
[1:56:42] but that's what happened to
[1:56:45] believer when we have God we have
[1:56:48] security
[1:56:53] let us
[1:56:55] not losing our Focus let us focused on
[1:57:00] Christ blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:57:03] yeah shall We rise on our
[1:57:12] feet but when I'm saying this message
[1:57:14] the date of Jesus Christ that the same
[1:57:16] power that spoke the world into
[1:57:18] existence is in those people that got
[1:57:20] the Holy Ghost
[1:57:24] amen he says in the message of the
[1:57:27] invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[1:57:30] that you were for ordained to a Son of
[1:57:32] God and were in God before the
[1:57:34] foundation of the world and you are only
[1:57:37] manifested in this day for his for his
[1:57:42] honor and
[1:57:43] glory and the last quote it say that if
[1:57:46] there wasn't a Lo to that son and
[1:57:50] daughter of God would create them a
[1:57:54] world out here and go live privately
[1:57:57] private life on it you have the power in
[1:58:00] you to do it and if you've got the
[1:58:03] shadow of the power of God in you the
[1:58:06] shadow you've got the power to do it God
[1:58:10] is om poent so see what I mean the power
[1:58:14] that is in you will make you could speak
[1:58:17] a world into existence and go live on it
[1:58:21] Hallelujah there you
[1:58:25] are praise be to God we can speak
