[34:03] together again
[34:07] to do what
[34:09] to receive your expectations
[34:15] I'm happy because God has given me a
[34:16] little inspiration tonight
[34:21] that I have no doubt that will be a
[34:24] blessing to us 18 to our telecoms
[34:29] so while we stand we read out of Genesis
[34:32] chapter 3 verse 1.
[34:37] now the Beast now the serpent was more
[34:40] subtle than any beast of the field which
[34:43] the Lord God had made and he said unto
[34:45] the woman yeah has God said ye shall not
[34:48] eat of every tree of the garden
[34:52] so
[35:11] shall we pray
[35:14] precious Lord Jesus
[35:16] we do not take this service for granted
[35:19] yes you are foreign
[35:51] knew each and everything yeah
[35:55] I realize I don't even know what I'm
[35:57] going to speak
[36:00] before the foundation of the world
[36:06] and how it would impact your children
[36:11] Lord may you help me that I will stay in
[36:14] my place
[36:18] and I'll let you speak through my
[36:21] through my my lips
[36:25] that something will be said tonight
[36:28] that your children will be blessed
[36:32] granted
[36:34] in Jesus name amen
[36:39] please be seated
[36:46] I'm speaking today
[36:48] um on this thought and I realize I have
[36:50] many thoughts that I have not concluded
[36:52] on uh
[36:59] and maybe like three or four of them so
[37:01] I have to keep going back as the Holy
[37:03] Spirit Will Lead me I mean
[37:08] but today yeah
[37:10] um during the beginning of the week I I
[37:12] this week have been you know meeting
[37:14] quite a few people weekend of changes
[37:19] just doing some counseling with them and
[37:24] um
[37:25] I um this thought just came up in one of
[37:29] those meetings
[37:33] it will be a blessing to us tonight I
[37:37] just want to speak on submitting your
[37:39] abilities to Christ
[37:51] do you realize that each of us is born
[37:53] with abilities
[37:57] born with things that we can do that
[38:00] others cannot do like
[38:06] you know you are born and you are born
[38:08] alone in the world
[38:11] you are the only you in the world
[38:14] there was no one else like you
[38:18] are the only you yeah
[38:21] there you die or the moment that you die
[38:25] that moment we have lost something
[38:28] to feed it can never be replaced again
[38:34] now I know that there are people who are
[38:36] born and they
[38:38] um you know see others and take them as
[38:40] role models and they can sometimes tend
[38:42] to be like them in Chinese
[38:58] [Music]
[39:01] we have also different god-given
[39:04] abilities
[39:09] so much more that the Bible says that
[39:12] gifts and calling uh gifts the gifts and
[39:15] the calling of God are without
[39:16] repentance
[39:21] so many things we can be able to do them
[39:25] at Birth when we've been to be engine
[39:29] you're born with those abilities
[39:33] they don't manifest immediately because
[39:36] you have to grow into them
[39:40] sometimes
[39:44] then you are able to realize that you
[39:47] have certain abilities or certain skills
[39:53] so you don't receive this because you
[39:56] you've been taught being a Toby funeral
[39:59] because you're born again
[40:02] because you're a Christian
[40:04] or because you are good or bad
[40:07] you have them simply because you're a
[40:09] human being this is what makes you
[40:11] different from the others we know one of
[40:13] you
[40:13] [Music]
[40:15] and I can give you quite a few here
[40:18] I know you already know yours
[40:22] things that you are good at it
[40:26] or things that you you are
[40:31] differentiates you from the others
[40:34] you know some have
[40:36] um a convincing tongue
[40:41] tongue
[41:14] [Music]
[41:34] you know even watching little children
[41:36] you can be able to refresh and say ah
[41:38] this one will be this so that one will
[41:40] be this
[41:44] and others you know can can there are
[41:47] very very instrumental in making things
[41:53] like they cannot make money
[41:56] you can build things maybe others are
[41:59] good givers
[42:00] they did not need to learn it from
[42:02] somebody to be a good Giver
[42:06] later others talk too much
[42:16] and you know it's a natural ability
[42:20] they just can't talk too much
[42:23] and you know I was speaking with the
[42:26] other brother the other day and he told
[42:28] me I'm like that Pastor
[42:31] rather smile a lot
[43:13] these are natural abilities
[43:19] but it is difficult to attain them
[43:23] even when you did
[43:26] you cannot be like the person or the
[43:29] human being that had it at Birth
[43:35] different people diversities of
[43:37] abilities
[43:39] but now many times and many times this
[43:42] is the problem
[43:44] but we do not yield our abilities to
[43:48] Christ your services
[43:50] we have our abilities and we don't
[43:52] actually use them for the glory of God
[43:56] and I wanted to give you quite a very
[43:59] weird example to begin with
[44:02] this is what has happened
[44:05] the Bible says the serpent was more
[44:08] subtle than any beast of the field
[44:14] the Lord God had made
[44:17] and so he came to the woman and actually
[44:19] beguiled the woman
[44:22] now the word subtle means
[44:25] making use of clever and indirect
[44:28] methods of to achieve something
[44:35] foreign
[44:46] [Music]
[45:46] and the Bible says it had all these
[45:49] abilities
[45:51] and I'm going to quite a few things for
[45:53] you here and I wanted to listen to me
[45:55] carefully
[45:57] the power of transformation he says so
[46:00] Saturn that morning perhaps met this
[46:02] evil one
[46:08] which was the
[46:10] serpenter not in a reptiles
[46:19] [Music]
[46:21] smart of all of the beasts
[46:28] and man is Beast himself
[46:32] we are Mama we are warm blooded animal
[46:34] foreign
[46:43] [Music]
[46:49] [Music]
[47:07] can I have three people come up here as
[47:09] I read this
[47:12] Three Brothers
[47:14] I want to demonstrate something for the
[47:17] people
[47:18] he says now science is looking for that
[47:20] Missing Link
[47:24] yeah come on come on three people please
[47:27] and even
[47:29] well it says
[47:32] science is looking for that Missing Link
[47:37] it is
[47:53] now here
[47:56] come right over this side here was the
[47:58] man
[48:00] human beings that God created in His
[48:05] image and here were the other beasts
[48:10] you know the brother says that the other
[48:12] that was a chimp
[48:14] right over the other side
[48:16] and and here between the shrimp
[48:20] katiwakatua and the man no moon was
[48:24] another Beast while which is
[48:28] now these things that I'm preaching to
[48:31] you this evening you cannot hear it
[48:32] anywhere
[48:35] you can't hear it in science
[48:40] because it's not spoken by a prophet of
[48:43] the end
[48:45] foreign
[49:55] hmm
[50:16] he was smart Charlie she gets he was
[50:19] subtle it was wise
[50:24] you see the fruit was pleased and it was
[50:27] desirable
[50:29] and when he lived with her that morning
[50:33] well of course
[50:37] now friends because let's take it a
[50:40] little bit slow here tonight
[50:42] I want you to know
[50:45] that Saturn does not fight useless
[50:48] people
[50:51] who suddenly can never fight anybody
[50:53] that is not useful
[50:57] no he cannot
[50:59] Saturn has an agenda
[51:01] and the only Gods
[51:04] he has a benefit again
[51:08] when you see someone being fought
[51:10] foreign
[51:16] people in the Bible here we can read
[51:18] about them that have been followed from
[51:20] the time they were born
[51:23] talk about people like Moses
[51:27] from the day he was born they never
[51:30] wanted to kill him
[51:32] even you know He Came Upon pharaoh and
[51:36] Pharaoh said go and kill all the young
[51:38] boys
[51:41] because the devil knew question him that
[51:44] someone was born just in that time
[51:47] that someone was going to be born
[51:50] and because of that they don't Rachel
[51:53] the devil told all the women The
[51:55] Midwives to kill the boys
[52:00] are you hearing me this evening kill all
[52:03] of them but do you know the devil was
[52:05] hunting one
[52:07] and that was Moses and mothers was taken
[52:11] in a in a basket was it a basket
[52:14] on on
[52:42] in Egypt the devil wanted to kill him
[52:46] but why did the devil want to kill Moses
[52:50] because sons has had a great purpose
[52:55] one was one of those
[52:57] that were born to destroy the intents
[53:01] and the works of the Devils
[53:07] so he wanted to finish him
[53:10] from the time he was born
[53:13] all three the devil was hunting
[53:16] foreign
[54:23] if you
[54:28] are here in this world those
[55:30] that are a danger to his kingdom
[55:36] how many here
[55:39] you don't need to lift your hand how
[55:40] many years
[55:46] I can tell you you're born foreign
[55:51] you're born for that purpose why do you
[55:53] wear chicken
[55:54] praise the name of the Lord if you have
[55:57] certain abilities
[55:57] [Music]
[56:10] listen please so we're talking about the
[56:13] abilities of the
[56:15] serpenters
[56:17] and when this happened
[56:19] um when the devil came down Lucifer
[56:24] okay let us read on here and then we
[56:26] will come back to that the Beast this is
[56:29] from the Ephesian Church age
[56:32] was so close to a human being
[56:36] and yet was pure animals
[56:45] she was an appraised creature
[56:49] and was somewhat in between a chimpanzee
[56:53] and a man
[56:56] but closer to a man
[57:00] he was closer to a man
[57:04] he was so close to being human that that
[57:09] his seed could and did mingle with that
[57:13] of the woman and cause her to conceive
[57:15] Charlie
[57:22] is
[57:28] if you have Revelation for this say Amen
[57:32] when this happened
[57:39] he changed every born in that serpent
[57:42] yes
[57:49] science can try all it wants to science
[57:54] and you won't find them missingly
[57:58] God
[58:02] and he can see an association of man
[58:05] with animals foreign
[58:16] God so let me read this again you missed
[58:19] it man is smart and he can see an
[58:21] association of man with animals
[58:28] and he tries to prove it out of
[58:31] evolution
[58:35] this little teaching here will help you
[58:39] how many have heard of evolution
[58:43] Evolution how many have never heard of
[58:45] it
[58:48] a
[59:04] was like a chimpanzee
[59:07] but he went becoming
[59:11] us
[59:18] and what happened
[59:20] if you were like this
[59:23] foreign
[59:31] foreign
[1:00:47] if you are not excited about that I
[1:00:49] don't know actually I'm excited about it
[1:00:54] praise the name of the Lord
[1:00:56] there isn't any Evolution
[1:00:59] together
[1:01:01] listen to what the prophet says
[1:01:04] one who went up to seventh grade seventh
[1:01:07] class
[1:01:13] praise the name of the Lord
[1:01:17] you you are in which class
[1:01:21] you were more educated than brother
[1:01:25] but hear what he's saying there isn't
[1:01:29] any Evolution
[1:01:34] but man and animals
[1:01:36] [Music]
[1:01:40] that is one of the mysteries of God that
[1:01:43] has remained hidden
[1:01:47] it is
[1:02:03] serpent here had abilities
[1:02:11] could even reason like a human being and
[1:02:17] foreign
[1:02:32] hmm
[1:02:33] those were the abilities
[1:02:35] number one the choker was very wise
[1:02:42] number three jokes are two good reason
[1:02:46] number four
[1:02:50] which could mean to
[1:02:56] conceived
[1:02:58] now Saturn in heaven
[1:03:00] when he stages his Rebellion
[1:03:04] he desire to come down to the Earth
[1:03:08] so you can calm down because he failed
[1:03:10] to take over
[1:03:12] in heaven so he wanted to come and take
[1:03:16] over
[1:03:20] your Saturn does not have a body sitan
[1:03:25] Italian Saturn only has is a spirit
[1:03:28] because the spirit
[1:03:32] suddenly cannot in any way have any
[1:03:36] connection with the human race
[1:03:40] without a link
[1:03:44] so you have to have a link
[1:03:47] in all that to take over the kingdom of
[1:03:50] God of Adam on our eyes
[1:03:56] he says thou has been in the garden of
[1:03:58] God
[1:04:01] the devil when he was thrown down from
[1:04:03] heaven
[1:04:05] he came down here
[1:04:07] in the Garden of Eden
[1:04:10] and when he came down the creature
[1:04:13] number one he wanted to go to church
[1:04:17] was one that could help him accomplish
[1:04:20] his purpose
[1:04:26] and Saturn could not find any better
[1:04:28] Christianity
[1:04:30] you couldn't find we looked at all the
[1:04:33] chimpanzees
[1:04:41] had the ability
[1:04:45] that can be able to connect with the
[1:04:47] human race
[1:04:50] but as the devil looked closer
[1:04:53] remember the devil was a spiritual being
[1:04:56] joking
[1:04:58] he was created by God
[1:05:01] having supernatural abilities
[1:05:19] witchcraft exists
[1:05:23] Darkness exists
[1:05:26] that therefore has power
[1:05:28] but all the power that he has
[1:05:31] what God gave him
[1:05:35] it
[1:05:36] are you hearing me this evening
[1:05:38] so I'm checking up with this teaching
[1:05:41] today
[1:05:45] cannot do anything with his power
[1:05:49] that was not given to him by God
[1:05:53] so whatever power he has
[1:05:56] lesser than what God has
[1:06:00] God is the Fountain of all problems
[1:06:18] I have one of my uncles
[1:06:20] one of the great witch doctors in our
[1:06:23] country
[1:06:26] I've met him once in my life
[1:06:30] you know he told me about the things
[1:06:33] they can do yeah
[1:06:35] and many many quite many things it is so
[1:06:39] scary when you hear this
[1:06:41] tells you that they can take a person
[1:06:45] eat their bed at night
[1:06:48] and make them dig the whole night
[1:06:54] and replace them
[1:06:56] he will tell you they cut that power to
[1:07:00] be wished
[1:07:01] using demonic power and influence
[1:07:04] we control your spirit
[1:07:08] they are this power because they get it
[1:07:11] from the devil
[1:07:13] but as I was trying to speak with him
[1:07:16] I wanted to understand
[1:07:25] but do you believe in God
[1:07:28] he told me anybody that doesn't believe
[1:07:31] in God is stupid
[1:07:37] so you believe in God we believe in God
[1:07:47] and I will tell you one thing
[1:07:50] the church needs to understand
[1:08:51] no one can stand before him
[1:09:21] Hallelujah man I always despise the new
[1:09:26] man people who go to Witchcraft
[1:09:31] who fear witchcraft
[1:09:35] I despise that
[1:09:38] the Bible says
[1:09:40] praise the name of the Lord no
[1:09:43] witchcraft in Israel
[1:09:46] no enchantment
[1:09:50] let me tell you God has exposed the many
[1:09:53] foreign
[1:09:58] if your sister go and ask my wife she
[1:10:00] will tell you the stories
[1:10:03] ever since we got married
[1:10:09] the witches
[1:10:11] we could see them in the vision
[1:10:13] wake up and deal with them
[1:10:17] in prayer
[1:10:19] and these are people that we know
[1:10:21] sometimes
[1:10:23] sometimes they hide themselves but
[1:10:26] sometimes God exposes them
[1:10:29] what is that the Bible says the battle
[1:10:32] we are fighting
[1:10:33] flesh
[1:10:37] we are fighting against principalities
[1:10:45] you need to know that God will stop
[1:10:49] when you know the story
[1:10:52] you cannot fear witchcraft
[1:10:56] because you will know among witchcraft
[1:10:59] exists
[1:11:01] Saturn exists eternally but God is
[1:11:04] greater than Satan
[1:11:06] and what Saturn has is called darkness
[1:11:11] and what we have is called light Isaiah
[1:11:15] it would be foolish for you to say a
[1:11:19] Darkness doesn't
[1:11:20] exists
[1:11:22] but because you know Darkness exists
[1:11:26] Oh Glory to God you will turn on the
[1:11:30] lights
[1:11:34] Darkness
[1:11:36] Darkness cannot stand before because
[1:11:58] foreign
[1:12:22] and he knew the woman yeah
[1:12:25] our user but now I want to go to the
[1:12:27] woman
[1:12:32] I need something I can use
[1:12:35] I looked around the garden
[1:12:46] so with his power
[1:12:49] foreign
[1:12:52] [Music]
[1:13:00] [Music]
[1:13:19] with all
[1:13:21] that were naturally given
[1:13:24] foreign
[1:14:31] Gatherings and when he was come out of
[1:14:34] the ship immediately there met him out
[1:14:37] of the tombs a man with an unclean
[1:14:40] Spirit who had his dwelling among the
[1:14:43] tombs and no man could bind him no not
[1:14:47] with chains
[1:14:49] you will follow me in English and then
[1:14:52] you can read in your Uganda Bible
[1:15:01] and the chains had been plucked asunder
[1:15:04] by him and the Fetters broken in pieces
[1:15:07] neither could any man tame him and
[1:15:10] always night and day he was in the
[1:15:12] mountains and in the tombs crying and
[1:15:15] cutting himself with stones but when he
[1:15:17] saw Jesus afarof he ran
[1:15:21] and worshiped him
[1:15:23] and he cried with a loud voice and said
[1:15:25] what have I to do with thee Jesus the
[1:15:28] son of the most high God I adjour Thee
[1:15:31] by God that thou torment me not for he
[1:15:34] is said unto him come out of the man
[1:15:36] thou unclean spirit and he asked him
[1:15:38] what is thy name and he said saying my
[1:15:41] name is Legion for we are many now I
[1:15:44] want you to see something here very very
[1:15:46] well
[1:15:48] here is Jesus yes coming on on to the
[1:15:53] other the side of gadara yes
[1:15:56] there is a reason why he came
[1:16:00] he will see it shortly
[1:16:03] he was approaching gadara
[1:16:07] there was this man
[1:16:09] Matthew says men to men
[1:16:15] but here Mark says there was a man
[1:16:19] and this man had a spirit in him
[1:16:26] are you following me if you're following
[1:16:29] me say Amen
[1:16:31] and so notice
[1:16:34] this man he was always Bound in Chains
[1:16:39] No amount of chains could bind him
[1:16:44] no amount of uh you know thing no man
[1:16:48] could tell him
[1:16:50] because he had too much power because
[1:16:54] let me say it this way
[1:17:00] and he was controlling him and giving
[1:17:03] him
[1:17:04] supernatural abilities
[1:17:09] when the Devil comes in a man
[1:17:12] he gives him supernatural abilities
[1:17:18] to become unnatural
[1:17:20] [Music]
[1:17:23] these words are very powerful but I hope
[1:17:26] and trust that you get a reference I'll
[1:17:29] give you an example
[1:17:32] human being
[1:17:34] has a natural ability to have affections
[1:17:41] we call it love
[1:17:44] touched by affection for somebody else
[1:17:48] and you know Naturally Speaking I I love
[1:17:52] you my sister
[1:17:55] because I love you I will give you
[1:17:57] something
[1:18:01] I will make sure you're fine
[1:18:03] but when the Devil comes in a man
[1:18:07] he will deal with him
[1:18:10] his abilities
[1:18:14] and he will Empower Manny's abilities
[1:18:19] [Music]
[1:18:20] to the point that those abilities will
[1:18:23] become
[1:18:25] unnatural
[1:18:31] you find a man it's like a money
[1:18:57] [Music]
[1:19:33] foreign
[1:19:44] how much I was changing
[1:19:54] nine percent
[1:19:56] but but by the time when we were long
[1:19:58] gone in the past
[1:20:00] I noticed he only gave me a quarter of
[1:20:04] the money
[1:20:08] oh God I assume
[1:20:14] so but that day myself as the best
[1:20:19] what happened
[1:20:24] one time somewhere I was buying some
[1:20:26] clothes
[1:20:28] on the street
[1:20:30] and when I reached home I saw this good
[1:20:33] trousers
[1:20:35] but by the time I arrived at home
[1:20:37] neither two killed was only a piece
[1:21:19] so because you know you will buy a
[1:21:22] trouser and then divide it into two and
[1:21:24] sell it to two different people the same
[1:21:25] amount of money
[1:21:49] [Music]
[1:22:05] I said really
[1:22:07] if it is a blessing I would say God has
[1:22:09] blessed you with wisdom
[1:22:12] so what is that it is not
[1:22:16] an ending
[1:22:17] but when it is natural and normal
[1:22:20] did you bless others
[1:22:23] as a way of spiking it up
[1:22:27] it's just like last
[1:22:30] but when God when the devil is enters a
[1:22:34] man
[1:22:36] you have a very huge sex drive
[1:22:42] you feel like you can't rest
[1:22:50] and you feel you have too much passion
[1:22:55] what is that change it is unnatural
[1:22:58] ability
[1:23:03] is controlling your body it is
[1:23:10] so right now I'm Discerning the devil
[1:23:14] praise the name of the Lord I'm not it's
[1:23:17] here and we know about many times
[1:23:19] because we have seen many people being
[1:23:21] delivered
[1:23:24] and this man was in Chains but because
[1:23:28] the devil was in him he was so powerful
[1:23:34] in just a moment
[1:23:37] he had Supernatural yeah
[1:23:41] but when he saw Jesus coming
[1:23:47] but also the devil Jesus
[1:23:51] now I want to show you here
[1:23:53] which one is the greater power
[1:23:57] as Jesus was coming yesterday
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:06] he worshiped him the Bible says that the
[1:24:10] devil knows there is one God
[1:25:47] foreign and at that moment Jesus said
[1:25:51] what is Thy Name
[1:25:55] saying my name is
[1:26:01] yeah
[1:26:03] every
[1:26:05] initials
[1:26:07] today that Jesus Christ is Lord yes
[1:26:19] [Music]
[1:26:21] that don't send us very far
[1:26:26] there is some sweetness
[1:26:41] this is the business of Saturn
[1:26:45] for him to operate
[1:26:48] he needs a vessel
[1:26:51] your brother sister don't be a vessel of
[1:26:55] the devil
[1:26:59] here the devil begs Jesus
[1:27:03] send us into the swine
[1:27:10] the way we have entered into this they
[1:27:12] were crying
[1:27:14] and Jesus yes give them leaves
[1:27:19] any green space went down
[1:27:22] and they entered into the swine
[1:27:25] and the Heart of the swine ran and
[1:27:28] businesses
[1:27:34] [Music]
[1:27:54] into foreign
[1:28:44] [Music]
[1:28:55] foreign
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:29:53] [Applause]
[1:29:55] some people even come to House of Prayer
[1:30:00] when they have not even cleaned
[1:30:04] and someone walks through the church
[1:30:10] who is that
[1:30:15] if someone let me let me leave what I
[1:30:17] was going to say but I'm telling you our
[1:30:21] Deacons
[1:30:29] [Music]
[1:30:31] use things you need to use
[1:30:33] that smell nice
[1:30:37] [Music]
[1:30:38] foreign
[1:30:47] praise God
[1:30:49] and this man was in terms
[1:30:52] and a clean Spirits were in here
[1:30:57] thinking with Dr clothes
[1:31:01] but when Jesus came
[1:31:06] all Harley Quinn Spirits your name is
[1:31:34] Jesus Christ
[1:31:49] amen I've been in countries
[1:31:53] which don't believe in Jesus
[1:31:59] but when you go in a community that
[1:32:02] believes in Jesus Christ
[1:32:12] this is the reason why Jesus came amen
[1:32:16] when he came he didn't come to rescue
[1:32:19] pigs
[1:32:21] he came to rescue the man who said that
[1:32:25] he was possessed by religion
[1:32:31] let me explain continue this speaks and
[1:32:34] big seasonal when the devil entered the
[1:32:37] city
[1:32:41] they had no choice
[1:32:47] the beast in the garden
[1:32:50] did not have any children
[1:32:56] do what you want
[1:32:59] religion Legion desired them
[1:33:05] you desired the pit yes
[1:33:09] religion desired Legion busy
[1:33:27] could do nothing about it
[1:33:32] some people said because of that we
[1:33:33] don't eat pigs no more Rachel today I'm
[1:33:37] busy we eat things
[1:33:40] because those ones died
[1:33:44] the ones we eat is
[1:33:48] because they are Sanctified my prayer
[1:33:53] and the blood of Jesus
[1:33:57] praise God
[1:34:01] those pigs not have a choice
[1:34:06] Legion desired them
[1:34:09] and they had them
[1:34:10] [Music]
[1:34:12] but this man
[1:34:14] he had a choice
[1:34:17] the devil desired him it doesn't matter
[1:34:21] how long since
[1:34:25] it doesn't matter how long
[1:34:27] was in the church
[1:34:39] because he was a seed of God Jesus
[1:35:00] Hallelujah
[1:35:26] foreign
[1:36:05] foreign
[1:36:33] this man was one of them
[1:36:43] had no choice
[1:36:45] to refuse this Deliverance
[1:36:50] amen if you're a seed of God
[1:36:53] only hear the word of God no choice
[1:36:57] but for his word to work
[1:37:03] foreign
[1:37:23] to be careful those are all in here
[1:37:28] but when Jesus came yes we knew one
[1:37:32] thing yeah Hallelujah
[1:37:36] so now this man had no choice
[1:37:44] and you come to the house
[1:37:47] let me tell you those demons have no
[1:37:50] choice
[1:38:39] foreign foreign
[1:40:07] he doesn't preach because people are
[1:40:09] very excited
[1:40:11] speech because people are very hot I
[1:40:14] don't care you might be cold as they
[1:40:16] assigned eyes
[1:40:51] [Music]
[1:40:54] [Applause]
[1:41:03] we don't have time foreign
[1:41:24] [Music]
[1:42:18] and then before it knew it he was going
[1:42:21] to the woman
[1:42:25] not by its power
[1:42:28] but by the powers
[1:42:34] and that's how the devil wants to attack
[1:42:42] and begin flirting with women
[1:42:51] you can go and begin to steal
[1:42:54] you can go and begin to tell lies you
[1:42:58] can go what is that change the
[1:42:59] slithering tongue
[1:43:03] possessing
[1:43:05] so the devil
[1:43:08] can possession
[1:43:10] but the difference between US
[1:43:14] Navy soul is that they have no choice
[1:43:19] but we have a choice
[1:43:23] Peter was the son of God
[1:43:32] Jesus was he talking to Peter yes
[1:43:45] Peter
[1:43:47] he was speaking to the devil
[1:43:49] and what he was speaking was the Gospel
[1:43:53] so the gospel speaks is really addressed
[1:43:56] to the devil
[1:44:00] and the demon no muslim wait behind him
[1:44:05] Peter did not physically go behind Jesus
[1:44:20] those demons
[1:44:25] and here the woman the woman
[1:44:29] she had a choice
[1:44:31] of Deliverance
[1:44:33] let me read this for you
[1:44:36] quickly because my time is almost time
[1:44:39] questions and answers 1964.
[1:44:43] suddenly serpent almost
[1:45:16] himself the spirit
[1:45:19] he knew that that was the only sea that
[1:45:22] would pregnant the woman
[1:45:27] because the chimpanzee won't do it
[1:45:31] they've mixed it and everything else it
[1:45:34] won't do it
[1:45:38] amen but he knowed that the jam of life
[1:45:42] that was in the chimpanzee would not
[1:45:43] come to the field of the woman
[1:45:46] [Music]
[1:46:16] but you see the sovereignty of God to
[1:46:19] display himself as a savior
[1:46:23] as I've explained many times
[1:46:28] before he come to her in the form of
[1:46:31] This Server
[1:46:33] which was the best
[1:46:36] and came to her
[1:46:39] and she
[1:46:41] Eve was pregnant by how much
[1:46:45] um
[1:46:46] [Music]
[1:46:51] in The Invisible Union of the bride of
[1:46:52] Christ
[1:46:54] is given to her as a sacred Trust From
[1:46:58] God
[1:47:02] no female dog very much
[1:47:09] no she is the only one
[1:47:12] by it she the reason is so sacred she is
[1:47:17] to bring forth life into the eyes
[1:47:23] her body is the bedding grounds of life
[1:47:29] that's the reason she is given this
[1:47:32] sacred aliens
[1:47:36] now here is where you may disagree many
[1:47:40] of you theologians
[1:47:43] that is the whole human race
[1:48:46] [Music]
