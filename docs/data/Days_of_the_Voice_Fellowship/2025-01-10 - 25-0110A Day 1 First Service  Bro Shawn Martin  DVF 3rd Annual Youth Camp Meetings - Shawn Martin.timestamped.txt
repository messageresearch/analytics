[1:07:49] something it takes just a
[1:07:53] moment and as these men of God are going
[1:07:55] to be preaching all through these
[1:07:59] meeting work on that
[1:08:03] pulsation that SP of A
[1:08:07] Moment Like Joshua did like Mary

[1:21:43] great things in

[1:21:50] over the people
[1:21:55] we pray that Faith would arise in the
[1:22:00] hearts we ask it in Jesus Christ
[1:22:04] name and everybody
[1:22:07] says amen amen you can you can have your
[1:22:14] seats amen so we read here he sent his
[1:22:18] word and healed
[1:22:22] them and delivered
[1:22:25] them and this word
[1:22:28] healing it means to make free from
[1:22:34] injury or
[1:22:36] disease to make sound or
[1:22:40] whole to
[1:22:43] restore to change the
[1:22:47] situation so God sent his word to
[1:22:53] heal to
[1:22:55] store to change the
[1:22:58] situation and the prophet taught
[1:23:01] us that healing doesn't just go belong
[1:23:04] to the the physical
[1:23:08] body but there's also healing of the
[1:23:11] Soul as
[1:23:13] well so there is a
[1:23:17] restoration for our
[1:23:19] soul as well as for our body
[1:23:24] and so when God sends his
[1:23:28] word it's a display of God's
[1:23:33] grace and I'm so glad that we have the
[1:23:36] word of God
[1:23:38] today how glad that you have the word of
[1:23:42] God
[1:23:43] Amen now as so many does not understand
[1:23:47] the importance of the
[1:23:50] word but you see God did not send his
[1:23:53] word
[1:23:56] for us just to uh uh to learn
[1:24:00] about and to
[1:24:03] reite but he sent his
[1:24:06] word to heal and to
[1:24:10] deliver God sends his word for a
[1:24:15] reason you see when God sends his
[1:24:19] word he's looking for results
[1:24:24] how many believes
[1:24:25] that amen and when we see that his word
[1:24:29] has been
[1:24:31] sent then we look for
[1:24:35] results yes sir amen so God does not
[1:24:39] want us to know his word by
[1:24:45] history God ain't here to give us a a
[1:24:48] history
[1:24:51] lesson but he wants us to look look for
[1:24:54] the
[1:24:57] results that his word will
[1:25:00] [Music]
[1:25:01] bring and he wants us to experience
[1:25:08] it and I'm so glad I've experienced
[1:25:13] it I'm not here to paint a fire for
[1:25:18] you I'm here to tell you about the
[1:25:20] experience that God has given us
[1:25:25] now what is a
[1:25:28] Christian it's the results of God's
[1:25:33] word God sent his
[1:25:37] word and it produced a
[1:25:40] Christian see God's word is
[1:25:44] powerful and as long as we have that
[1:25:48] word there ain't no devil that's going
[1:25:50] to defeat
[1:25:52] us you see the the prophet taught
[1:25:55] us that in the
[1:25:58] beginning God gave man his
[1:26:02] word amen see he knew that the devil was
[1:26:05] lurking
[1:26:07] around he knew what the devil was
[1:26:10] capable
[1:26:12] of so he gave his word to
[1:26:17] man as a defense against the
[1:26:22] devil the Devil Couldn't
[1:26:24] man as long as he stayed with the word
[1:26:27] of
[1:26:30] [Music]
[1:26:31] God the devil couldn't touch
[1:26:35] man he he couldn't ruin
[1:26:40] creation as long as man believed God's
[1:26:46] word but because man fell in the
[1:26:51] beginning we now know what SAT is
[1:26:54] capable
[1:26:57] of we see the corruption in the
[1:27:00] land we see ungodly things that men
[1:27:05] do but I got good news for you the word
[1:27:08] of God is still our
[1:27:13] defense it's a defense against any demon
[1:27:16] that comes against
[1:27:19] us that word of God will help the
[1:27:21] youngest person in here
[1:27:26] the word of God is Not only just for us
[1:27:31] ministers it's not just for our
[1:27:34] parents but the word of God is for you
[1:27:37] young people as
[1:27:40] well yes sir you see God gave us his
[1:27:45] word because it's the best thing that he
[1:27:48] could give
[1:27:50] us God knows how to fortify his
[1:27:56] people God knows the power that the word
[1:28:00] [Music]
[1:28:03] has so you see Satan cannot triumph over
[1:28:06] God's
[1:28:09] word no matter what the devil
[1:28:14] does no matter what he tries to
[1:28:17] bring no matter how discouraged you
[1:28:21] are Satan cannot try
[1:28:24] over the word of
[1:28:27] God the word of God Will Save The
[1:28:30] rottenest
[1:28:33] Sinner the word of God will heal the
[1:28:36] worst uh uh uh uh uh sickness in the
[1:28:43] land now Jesus proved to us that the
[1:28:46] weapon is the is the word of
[1:28:51] God he proved that it's the best weapon
[1:28:54] against the
[1:28:57] devil you see Jesus had power upon
[1:29:02] power but he didn't use one of them
[1:29:06] powers to defeat the Devil
[1:29:10] with he used the word of
[1:29:14] God and the prophet said he did it to
[1:29:17] show
[1:29:20] us that the weakest Christian can defeat
[1:29:25] anytime
[1:29:27] anywhere any place Hallelujah under any
[1:29:33] [Music]
[1:29:40] condition you may not have a lot of
[1:29:42] gifts in your
[1:29:45] life you may be one that cannot
[1:29:49] sing you may be one that just feels like
[1:29:52] you're nothing
[1:29:55] but you have the word of
[1:29:58] God so God did not leave you
[1:30:03] helpless he didn't leave us preachers
[1:30:07] helpless he didn't leave us parents
[1:30:12] helpless and he didn't leave you young
[1:30:14] people
[1:30:17] helpless now you don't have to feel
[1:30:20] saved
[1:30:24] maybe you're sick here today and you and
[1:30:27] you've asked God to heal
[1:30:32] you well you don't have to feel like
[1:30:34] you're
[1:30:35] [Music]
[1:30:37] healed to defeat the
[1:30:40] Devil you don't have to feel
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:45] saved to defeat the
[1:30:48] Devil you don't have to feel like you're
[1:30:50] on the mountain
[1:30:52] top to Beat the Devil with see the
[1:30:56] prophet said the devil can beat you
[1:30:59] around and around the stump on your
[1:31:06] feelings but when he meets the word of
[1:31:11] God he can't come on
[1:31:14] that so no matter how low I
[1:31:19] feel Satan cannot triumph over me
[1:31:24] no matter how discouraged I
[1:31:28] am Satan cannot triumph over
[1:31:32] me for I have the word of
[1:31:36] God well aren't you glad for
[1:31:39] that now you see the Book of Genesis
[1:31:43] shows us that the word of God has to be
[1:31:46] sent
[1:31:50] first before the power of God can be
[1:31:57] Genesis 1 and
[1:31:59] 2 it tells us that the Earth was without
[1:32:04] form it was void and darkness was upon
[1:32:08] the face of the
[1:32:11] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[1:32:14] the
[1:32:16] face of the
[1:32:18] waters and God said let there be light
[1:32:26] you see why did God send his
[1:32:30] word because God was going to change the
[1:32:36] situation see his word went
[1:32:40] forth Let There
[1:32:43] Be and life followed
[1:32:47] it now the Bible says that is Jesus
[1:32:51] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:32:58] forever now all I've got to say to
[1:33:02] you is that God not only wanted light in
[1:33:05] the
[1:33:08] beginning but he desired Sons and
[1:33:11] Daughters of
[1:33:14] God to stand in this
[1:33:18] age and Triumph over the
[1:33:20] [Music]
[1:33:22] enemy can you say
[1:33:25] now he sent his
[1:33:27] word to change the
[1:33:30] situation and if he did it back
[1:33:34] then then God doesn't send us an
[1:33:40] emotion he doesn't send us a
[1:33:44] feeling
[1:33:45] today to defeat the Devil
[1:33:49] with he sends his word
[1:33:55] can you say
[1:33:56] Amen now why did God send his word in
[1:34:00] the
[1:34:00] [Applause]
[1:34:02] beginning because there was seed that
[1:34:05] was laying under the water that needed
[1:34:08] to come
[1:34:13] forth well where did that seed come
[1:34:17] from well God sent his word and created
[1:34:21] it
[1:34:24] the prophet said he formed those seeds
[1:34:27] by his own
[1:34:32] word for there was nothing else to make
[1:34:34] that seed out
[1:34:37] of and the prophet said them seeds would
[1:34:40] then transform themselves into the plant
[1:34:44] that the word of God has spoken them to
[1:34:47] be
[1:34:54] so God created seeds like a
[1:34:59] tree a
[1:35:01] plant a
[1:35:03] flower grass he planted all kinds of
[1:35:08] seeds for the purpose of them coming
[1:35:11] forth and being what he called them to
[1:35:18] be see he didn't form the seed just to
[1:35:20] lay dormant
[1:35:24] and he didn't form you just for you to
[1:35:27] lay
[1:35:29] dormant he didn't put them seeds in the
[1:35:32] ground for them to be powerless by the
[1:35:38] darkness can you say
[1:35:40] Amen now the prophet said the word
[1:35:45] seed was there before the real seed was
[1:35:49] ever
[1:35:52] formed we know that God made the world
[1:35:55] out of things that does not
[1:36:01] appear and he did it by his own
[1:36:05] word can you say
[1:36:07] Amen yes sir see the word formed the
[1:36:14] seed and that's how you are a Christian
[1:36:19] today is the word made you
[1:36:24] can you say Amen the word called you to
[1:36:27] be what you
[1:36:31] are so that seed laay dormant because
[1:36:34] the the the darkness was laying or or
[1:36:38] the world was laying under
[1:36:45] Darkness the Bible says that the Earth
[1:36:48] was without uh a form and it was void
[1:36:55] the prophet said the world was covered
[1:36:58] with
[1:37:00] water and laid in the dark dismal gloomy
[1:37:07] atmosphere but the spirit of God moved
[1:37:11] upon the
[1:37:13] water and the word went
[1:37:17] forth and God said let there be
[1:37:22] light and he sent his
[1:37:26] word by speaking his
[1:37:28] word now I want you to know now he sends
[1:37:32] his
[1:37:34] word by speaking
[1:37:37] it can you say Amen the prophet said at
[1:37:41] that time the Mist cleared away and
[1:37:44] darkness went to one corner and light
[1:37:47] shined at the other side
[1:37:54] what it tells us is that God's word will
[1:37:57] defeat the power of
[1:38:03] Darkness you see when God sent his
[1:38:07] word the prophet said the entire picture
[1:38:10] was
[1:38:12] changed from a total chaos to a Garden
[1:38:16] of
[1:38:19] Eden the power of the word of God
[1:38:25] we see the power of the word in the
[1:38:27] vision of the Prophet
[1:38:33] Ezekiel he had a vision of the dry
[1:38:38] bones it was such a bad
[1:38:42] situation Them Bones were scattered all
[1:38:45] over the
[1:38:46] place and when God asked that
[1:38:50] Prophet can these bones live
[1:38:54] that Prophet had no
[1:38:56] answer and he just said only thou
[1:39:00] knowest that God was going to change the
[1:39:06] situation and he began to speak and and
[1:39:09] sent that word by a
[1:39:13] prophet and he said Son of Man
[1:39:17] prophesy can you say
[1:39:19] amen and the word of the Lord went forth
[1:39:25] and it brought about four stages of
[1:39:31] restoration now we know that in the
[1:39:33] fourth
[1:39:35] stage the word brought life to them
[1:39:40] bones and the Bible says they rose up a
[1:39:43] mighty
[1:39:46] Army what that word
[1:39:49] was was a message of life
[1:39:54] can you say
[1:39:55] amen amen the message of
[1:39:58] life amen and when the message of Life
[1:40:01] went
[1:40:03] forth God breathed upon that
[1:40:08] bones and they begin to
[1:40:12] live now Church the message of life has
[1:40:15] been sent to
[1:40:19] us can you say
[1:40:21] amen and when God send
[1:40:25] something when he sends his
[1:40:28] word then something's got to
[1:40:32] happen Hallelujah for God promised that
[1:40:35] the word that goes out of his mouth will
[1:40:38] not return unto him
[1:40:47] void but it shall
[1:40:50] accomplish I said it shall accomplish
[1:40:55] that word shall
[1:40:57] accomplish God's going to have the
[1:40:59] desire of his
[1:41:02] heart that word is going to have an
[1:41:07] effect and it shall prosper in the thing
[1:41:12] where unto he sends
[1:41:17] it now I want to say
[1:41:21] this if you want to see God in
[1:41:25] action look what he
[1:41:29] promised don't look at what the world's
[1:41:33] doing don't look at all the
[1:41:36] chaos don't look at the trouble in your
[1:41:39] life look at what God
[1:41:44] promised can you say Amen if you want to
[1:41:48] see the
[1:41:50] supernatural look at what God promised
[1:41:55] yes sir see find out what he promised
[1:41:59] amen see now you know I don't want to
[1:42:02] know what man about what man says about
[1:42:06] [Music]
[1:42:09] things can you say
[1:42:12] man you know what I'm not even here to
[1:42:14] look at you yes and give you my opinion
[1:42:18] of you
[1:42:20] [Music]
[1:42:24] you don't want to know what I what I
[1:42:26] have to
[1:42:28] say you can look at yourself and say I
[1:42:30] am just in a
[1:42:34] mess and I can look at you and say yeah
[1:42:37] you're
[1:42:39] right but that ain't going to help
[1:42:42] you but see when you see what God has
[1:42:46] promised God promised I'll never leave
[1:42:49] you nor forsake
[1:42:51] you I'll be with you to the end of the
[1:42:56] world God promised that no weapon formed
[1:42:59] against
[1:43:00] you is going to
[1:43:05] prosper that word will never
[1:43:10] fail that word will not return unto him
[1:43:20] void whatever he promised is going to
[1:43:27] happen that's why your pastor fought so
[1:43:31] hard amen even though the devil was
[1:43:34] resisting he knew that God would honor
[1:43:37] his
[1:43:40] [Applause]
[1:43:47] word God promised where two or three are
[1:43:50] gathered in his name he will will be
[1:43:53] here in their
[1:43:59] midst and the devil can't stop
[1:44:05] it the devil can't stop God from coming
[1:44:09] in Among
[1:44:14] Us God's word is going to be
[1:44:20] fulfilled I don't care how impossible it
[1:44:25] seems you might got a lost loved one
[1:44:28] that you're praying
[1:44:31] for you may have been praying for the
[1:44:33] baptism of the Holy
[1:44:36] Ghost you may be praying for
[1:44:40] salvation and the devil is telling you
[1:44:42] you've gone too
[1:44:45] far but no matter how impossible it
[1:44:50] seems God will fulfill his word in your
[1:44:58] [Applause]
[1:44:59] [Music]
[1:45:02] [Applause]
[1:45:06] life Hallelujah I don't care how long it
[1:45:12] takes I don't care how dark the hour
[1:45:16] is God's word is a promise to
[1:45:21] us I say to you the word that God
[1:45:25] sends is a promise to
[1:45:32] us yes sir it's our
[1:45:35] absolute can you say the word is our
[1:45:39] [Music]
[1:45:43] absolute God doesn't send his word for
[1:45:46] us to argue
[1:45:50] over God doesn't send his word for as
[1:45:53] the
[1:45:56] question God sends his word as an
[1:45:59] absolute to
[1:46:03] you you can rest your soul on
[1:46:08] it you can rest your faith in
[1:46:12] it it's your defense against the
[1:46:18] enemy well can you give the Lord a hand
[1:46:20] clap of praise

[1:46:31] now every promise of God is a
[1:46:33] predestinated
[1:46:38] seed how many believes in
[1:46:44] predestination every word of

[1:47:03] lie turn around tell your neighbor God
[1:47:05] cannot
[1:47:08] lie I I know it's dark but God cannot
[1:47:14] lie I know the tears may be flowing that
[1:47:17] God cannot lie
[1:47:23] back may be against the wall but cannot
[1:47:27] [Applause]
[1:47:28] lie we came all the way here to tell you
[1:47:32] God cannot
[1:47:35] lie I didn't come here wondering if God
[1:47:38] was going to move I know God's going to
[1:47:42] [Applause]
[1:47:47] move because God cannot lie
[1:47:52] he's obligated to his
[1:47:56] word he cannot
[1:47:58] lie so he's obligated to his
[1:48:03] word he's not obligated to
[1:48:06] you he's not obligated to
[1:48:10] you he's not obligated to
[1:48:14] me but he's obligated to this word
[1:48:17] concerning
[1:48:21] me he's ated to his word concerning
[1:48:27] you he wouldn't have sent you his word
[1:48:30] if he didn't mean
[1:48:34] it but because he sent his word he is
[1:48:42] determined to fulfill his
[1:48:44] [Applause]
[1:48:47] word
[1:48:50] amen well do you love him oh
[1:48:54] [Applause]
[1:48:56] now what is a
[1:49:00] word it's an expression of a
[1:49:05] [Music]
[1:49:08] thought God's
[1:49:11] word is an
[1:49:15] expression of his own
[1:49:19] thoughts I did not express them all
[1:49:22] right
[1:49:24] his word is not an expression of my
[1:49:28] thoughts it's not an expression of our
[1:49:31] brother's
[1:49:34] thoughts it's not an expression of your
[1:49:38] thoughts his word is an expression of
[1:49:41] his own
[1:49:47] thoughts so then the prophet tells us
[1:49:50] God's thoughts are eternal
[1:49:57] and they are
[1:49:59] real see God's
[1:50:02] word deals with the plan of
[1:50:07] God and the purpose of
[1:50:12] God see I may have thoughts about
[1:50:16] myself I may have thoughts about myself
[1:50:23] and may be may they may be negative
[1:50:28] thoughts how many's ever had negative
[1:50:30] thoughts about
[1:50:32] yourself you might even have complexes
[1:50:35] about
[1:50:38] yourself and you you might think well I
[1:50:41] just don't know if I'm going to make
[1:50:44] it I just don't know if I can ever
[1:50:49] overcome I I I just don't know if I'll
[1:50:51] ever be healed
[1:50:55] I've been seeking the Holy Ghost I just
[1:50:56] don't know if I'll ever get
[1:51:00] it them are your
[1:51:03] thoughts not God's
[1:51:08] thoughts there may be some of you here
[1:51:10] today that feel like you cross the
[1:51:15] line cross the line of Mercy
[1:51:23] but them are your
[1:51:27] thoughts but God's
[1:51:31] thoughts are expressed in his
[1:51:35] word and they are
[1:51:38] Eternal and they are
[1:51:43] real they are
[1:51:46] real well can I tell you God never
[1:51:48] thought of you being a
[1:51:50] sinner yeah God never thought of you
[1:51:52] being a
[1:51:58] sinner he never thought of you being
[1:52:00] lost and going to
[1:52:04] hell he never thought of you being so
[1:52:06] decrepit and down
[1:52:11] hardened he never thought of you being
[1:52:14] defeated by the
[1:52:17] enemy the Bible says hell was prepared
[1:52:21] for the devil and his
[1:52:27] angels they were not prepared for
[1:52:32] you Hallelujah hell was not prepared for
[1:52:36] the Sons and Daughters of
[1:52:41] God so the devil might be telling you
[1:52:44] you're going to
[1:52:47] hell but you tell him that was never in
[1:52:50] the thoughts of God
[1:52:55] and God's thoughts are Eternal and they
[1:52:58] are
[1:53:04] real
[1:53:07] Hallelujah I know I was born a
[1:53:11] sinner but God's thoughts about me were
[1:53:15] were more real than me being a sinner
[1:53:24] I found out the reason why I could be
[1:53:26] changed from a sinner to a
[1:53:31] saint is because God never thought of me
[1:53:34] as a
[1:53:39] sinner
[1:53:42] Hallelujah and anything that was not in
[1:53:45] God's mind is subject to change
[1:53:51] [Music]
[1:53:58] Hallelujah well praise the
[1:54:01] Lord glorify
[1:54:08] [Applause]
[1:54:10] him
[1:54:14] Hallelujah
[1:54:17] am see God's thoughts are Eternal and
[1:54:21] they are real
[1:54:27] so his thoughts did not form from his
[1:54:34] imagination you can imagine something
[1:54:37] and it's not
[1:54:40] real you can imagine you had a
[1:54:43] conversation that never
[1:54:48] happened you can imagine things that
[1:54:51] never transpire
[1:54:55] but God's thoughts are Eternal and they
[1:54:58] are
[1:55:01] [Applause]
[1:55:03] real that's why you always were a Son of
[1:55:09] God that's why the prophet said you were
[1:55:11] never saved on any given day you was
[1:55:14] always saved in the mind of God
[1:55:24] [Music]
[1:55:25] [Applause]
[1:55:28] and I'll just tell you right now God's
[1:55:30] not worried about losing you

[1:56:27] place
[1:56:29] Hallelujah glor Glory
[1:56:40] Glory you see the thoughts of
[1:56:44] God did not come from God just simply
[1:56:48] wishing for it
[1:56:54] but God he formulated a plan by his
[1:57:02] thoughts the Bible says known unto God
[1:57:05] are all of his works from the
[1:57:08] beginning known unto God are all his
[1:57:11] works from the
[1:57:18] beginning says
[1:57:26] the Bible says he knew the end from the
[1:57:32] beginning the prophet said he created
[1:57:35] the world first by his
[1:57:40] thought and I say to you he created Sons
[1:57:43] and Daughters by his thought first
[1:57:52] Ephesians 1 and 1 through

[1:59:43] saying God wasn't forced to save
[1:59:48] you he wasn't forced to predestinate you
[1:59:53] he did it of his own good
[1:59:58] pleasure he chose you before the

[2:00:58] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[2:01:01] the image of his son that he might be
[2:01:03] the firstborn among many
[2:01:17] Brethren moreover whom he did
[2:01:19] predestinate them he also called and
[2:01:22] whom he called them he also Justified
[2:01:25] and whom he justified them he also
[2:01:41] glorified he did it by his

[2:01:57] are
[2:02:01] [Applause]
[2:02:01] [Music]

[2:02:06] was a world you were in God's thoughts
[2:02:09] to give you the Holy
[2:02:19] Ghost because he knew you would be
[2:02:22] wanting
[2:02:25] it and he chose you himself because you
[2:02:31] desired he chose you in Christ before
[2:02:34] you or Jesus any of you was on the
[2:02:38] [Music]
[2:02:43] earth and He sent Jesus to die to

[2:03:23] God to heal
[2:03:28] us we think that we have to beg God to
[2:03:31] give us the Holy
[2:03:35] Ghost we think that we have to beg God
[2:03:38] to deliver
[2:03:45] us you don't have to beg God to do
[2:03:49] anything he's already prepared
[2:03:54] he's already died for
[2:03:56] it all you have to do is believe in
[2:04:01] it die die out to your own
[2:04:05] thinking die out to your own
[2:04:10] thinking die out to your own
[2:04:13] [Applause]
[2:04:15] self and accept his thoughts about you
[2:04:23] Hallelujah can you say
[2:04:27] Amen this message that God sent to us is
[2:04:31] not to get us to beg
[2:04:38] God it's to get us to receive what he's
[2:04:40] already
[2:04:45] done remember a pardon is not a pardon
[2:04:50] unless received that
[2:05:02] ain't that
[2:05:03] right now God's word is a
[2:05:08] seed a Word of
[2:05:12] Promise and the prophet said the seed of
[2:05:15] God is actually placed in US
[2:05:22] from the foundation of the
[2:05:26] world that Word of
[2:05:30] Promise was placed in
[2:05:33] us before the foundation of the
[2:05:37] world can you say Amen you're not trying
[2:05:41] to be
[2:05:44] saved we're not Christians trying to be
[2:05:47] a
[2:05:50] Christian we're not saved trying to be
[2:05:55] saved we're not living this Christian
[2:05:58] Life scared of
[2:06:01] hell you shouldn't serve God because
[2:06:04] afraid to go to
[2:06:10] hell can you say Amen
[2:06:14] Church how many times in the Bible the
[2:06:16] Bible says fear not
[2:06:21] fear
[2:06:23] not the prophet said the problem is is
[2:06:25] people
[2:06:29] scared that God will not fulfill his
[2:06:35] promise you don't have to be
[2:06:39] scared simply
[2:06:42] believe that Word of
[2:06:46] Promise is inside of you
[2:06:53] can you say
[2:06:55] Amen now we didn't come into this
[2:06:59] world reflecting what God called us to
[2:07:11] be the woman at the
[2:07:14] well did not come into this
[2:07:18] world reflecting what God called her to
[2:07:21] be
[2:07:23] when Jesus came to
[2:07:26] her she was not
[2:07:30] reflecting what God had called her to
[2:07:34] be but she had a predestinated
[2:07:38] sea on the inside of
[2:07:44] her she was a
[2:07:47] prostitute she was an ill famed woman
[2:07:53] but God knew her in his
[2:07:57] thinking and he sent his word to
[2:08:03] her can you say
[2:08:05] Amen now notice the word came to her in
[2:08:10] the form of a
[2:08:16] man the fullness of the word was in him
[2:08:24] come on
[2:08:26] church that word came to her seeking her
[2:08:34] out
[2:08:36] hello the word didn't come to her to
[2:08:39] give her a Bible
[2:08:47] Lesson the word didn't come to her to
[2:08:50] give her an emotional
[2:08:54] F
[2:08:55] hello but the same God that spoke the
[2:08:59] word let there be light in the
[2:09:06] beginning was now in a man Jesus
[2:09:12] [Applause]
[2:09:14] Christ and God was in
[2:09:18] Christ reconciling the World his elect
[2:09:23] to
[2:09:27] himself and that same
[2:09:29] [Applause]
[2:09:31] word had the same
[2:09:35] power to change that woman
[2:09:42] [Applause]
[2:09:45] situation I'm not going to take much
[2:09:49] longer but a prophet said this as soon
[2:09:52] as it spoke it the word spoke to her she
[2:09:56] said I perceive you're a
[2:10:00] [Music]
[2:10:04] prophet and she said I know the Messiah
[2:10:07] will do
[2:10:11] this now what did he do to identify
[2:10:15] himself what did he do to identify who
[2:10:18] he was
[2:10:22] he performed the same sign that MZ did
[2:10:25] to
[2:10:30] Abraham he discerned her heart and told
[2:10:33] her her
[2:10:38] life and she knew she had a teaching
[2:10:42] that when the Messiah come he will do
[2:10:45] that same sign
[2:10:52] and he said I am
[2:10:57] he now the prophet said what did it
[2:11:01] do it cleaned out the
[2:11:05] Blackness and made it all
[2:11:10] white
[2:11:11] why there was a seed laying there a
[2:11:15] predestinated seed
[2:11:22] it was God's thought before the
[2:11:24] foundation of the
[2:11:31] world and because she was a
[2:11:34] predestinated
[2:11:37] seed she recognized the
[2:11:42] word that was s to redeem
[2:11:47] her can you say
[2:11:49] amen and the word cleared out all the
[2:11:53] darkness and the mock and the sin in her
[2:12:02] life to where she could believe it and
[2:12:05] quickly the prophet said her sins were
[2:12:08] forgiven
[2:12:16] her well do you love him now the prophet
[2:12:20] said when he pressed his Messiah
[2:12:26] sign by telling her what she had
[2:12:30] done she said sir I perceive that you
[2:12:33] are a
[2:12:35] prophet and we know the Messiah when he
[2:12:39] comes he will tell us all
[2:12:43] things notice she was recognizing him as
[2:12:47] the Messiah the anointed one
[2:12:55] because he had met the scripture
[2:13:02] qualifications the two pieces of paper
[2:13:05] were coming
[2:13:10] together for she said we know that when
[2:13:12] the Messiah
[2:13:18] cometh now he says what did this do
[2:13:23] putting the old scripture with the
[2:13:25] experience that Jesus was given
[2:13:28] her what did it
[2:13:33] do it made the
[2:13:37] Messiah and quickly her sins were
[2:13:42] forgiven because after
[2:13:45] beginning she was
[2:13:49] redeemable because she was in God's
[2:13:52] thinking at the
[2:13:57] beginning so it redeemed
[2:14:01] her or brought her
[2:14:04] back when she seen the expressed
[2:14:07] scripture manifested of Jehovah what he
[2:14:10] was and what he
[2:14:19] is and we have seen that same sign in
[2:14:23] this last
[2:14:28] day I say to you it was more than just a
[2:14:34] prophet Jesus Christ was made
[2:14:41] manifest not just in a spoken word
[2:14:46] body but in a redeemed body
[2:14:52] he was able to take the body of brother
[2:14:58] Brandon the body of brother
[2:15:02] brandom and performed the same Messiah
[2:15:10] sign can you say am man I say to you it
[2:15:14] was more than a man that came to us in
[2:15:16] this
[2:15:19] age now we're not did find brother
[2:15:24] brandham brother brandham was just a
[2:15:28] man he was he he had to be saved just
[2:15:31] like you and
[2:15:34] I that God was able to so possess that
[2:15:40] man to where we could see that it was
[2:15:43] Christ that has come to
[2:15:49] us in the form of his
[2:15:55] word son of man
[2:15:57] [Applause]
[2:16:00] revealed in this
[2:16:05] age didn't have to die for
[2:16:10] us but he came to claim
[2:16:15] us for he had already paid the price of
[2:16:19] redemption
[2:16:24] Jesus Christ paid the price of
[2:16:27] redemption in that Corporal
[2:16:34] body and by his
[2:16:38] blood he was able to redeem a
[2:16:44] body
[2:16:46] amen that he could take full possession
[2:16:50] of
[2:16:54] and manifest himself
[2:16:59] through to claim you and
[2:17:03] I I hope that makes sense now the word
[2:17:07] has come to claim
[2:17:14] you can you say
[2:17:16] Amen not everybody's going to believe
[2:17:18] this message of the hour
[2:17:23] but there is a redeemed
[2:17:26] people that was in his
[2:17:30] thinking and it's not that we're any
[2:17:33] better than anybody
[2:17:39] else it's not that we are a people
[2:17:42] without
[2:17:45] problems but we realize that we're more
[2:17:48] than just them people
[2:17:53] we are Sons and Daughters of
[2:18:02] God well how many sons and daughters of
[2:18:05] God do we
[2:18:11] have now you know the Bible says that he
[2:18:13] will rise with healing in his wings the
[2:18:16] son of righteousness will rise with
[2:18:19] healing in his wings
[2:18:26] now church do you realize the prophet
[2:18:28] said that that healing in his
[2:18:35] wing doesn't just mean physical
[2:18:40] healing of a
[2:18:42] disease maybe you got arthritis or
[2:18:44] whatever God's been doing
[2:18:48] that but he said this heal
[2:18:53] is actually the changing of our
[2:18:57] body going from Mortal to
[2:19:04] immortality church he sent his
[2:19:12] word I'm so glad that he s his
[2:19:17] word can we stand to our feet and just
[2:19:20] lift up our
[2:19:21] hands musicians will
[2:19:24] come Hallelujah there's something that
[2:19:27] is drawing us back oh
