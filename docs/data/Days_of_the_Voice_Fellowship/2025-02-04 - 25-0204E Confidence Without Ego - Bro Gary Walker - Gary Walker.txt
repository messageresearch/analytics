that he will Minister according to the orles of we give you glory we give you H in Jesus name amen I'd like to greet you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ can you your neighbor tell them God bless you welcome to the uh you may be seated for just a few moments uh I would like to um first of [Music] all appreciate and welcome Pastor Robert who with us today while we t for a few others who who may join us later I want to have Pastor Robert greet us and then I know on Sunday I did not give him any moment for the team to greet the [Music] church I'm sure many of you would want would want to hear at least greeting from as well amen so he will be the he will be John the Baptist for the pastor he prepare the way for him and invite him for now let me invite our Pastor Robert Pastor if you can come and greet us we would be happy to hear [Applause] amen I want to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus I want to say that I'm grateful to be here the of the of Lord I didn't know that I would be here but when P extended an invitation I was you know touched I felt like what can I do I had so many things I was going to handle but God helped us that we were able to be through by this time said we have to join our God bless you I Tred with my wife and two of my children amen and one brother from the church Brother D amen we are grateful thanks for inviting God bless you thank you so much when I came to cala you remember I told you when we invited Pastor Robert to minister to us here I told you he was one of the first people who encouraged me he said if you you have a burden on your hand the Lord is with you we just start and he encouraged us out of that hundreds have been blessed since we started this do you appreciate Pastor Robert amen amen um can I have brother team come but before he comes I just want to say I appreciate these brothers for the sacrifice they have made to uh come to Uganda I have been inviting Brother Gary for a long time several years and you know he was about to come I think a few years ago and then a few things happened in the middle there also his wife sister Deborah went to be with the Lord and so it was not possible for him to come but God designed and desired this season he would be able to come I want to say Pastor Gary your ministry has been a blessing to UGA uh we were in carja where he ministered to at least uh three 3,500 4,000 people in two different places and uh the his ministry is that I was telling by the Robert is that of teaching and grounding and I believe needs that just like we need it here have been blessed here on Sunday how many really were really really really blessed I personally was really really bled and so we appreciate you and we invite you again how many invite him again amen amen we invite you again should the Lord give the opportunity we will be happy to have you and the next time I was thinking that I will work with these pastors so that we can have you see Pastor Robert now that you are here you representing other pastors in you hear him preach and you will agree with me his ministry needs to be H and uh next time if he comes I would really be happy if we in here can arrange have some min something like that where he can be a blessing to the to the to the whole body in but we also thank God for the technology that we can be able to stream this and it can get to as far as whoever that desires to hear as well as those who can see it later on so God bless you I appreciate you you have been a blessing brother te has not preached a sermon in in Uganda has preached to me many by his life I don't say this to be good I mean it and I appreciate you by the te would you please come and greet the people and then afterward invite the God bless you brothers and sisters it is a a really special thing to be here I consider it a highlight of my life we go through many things in our lives but I think the long longer we are here as Christians the more we put weight on top of the things that God puts in our path that we believe are more attributed to the Eternal things than the temporal things and I have a my my mom is from South Africa so I've mentioned to Pastor Gary and Pastor buz if there is one place on Earth that I had a a deep love for it is Africa and so I consider it a tremendous blessing to be amongst you wonderful people know knowing that we believe that maybe our skin color is different maybe our culture is different but we can have a Oneness in our spirit because we believe that we have the same father amen amen what a privilege to believe that we came from the same place and that we as we are I mean as we are you know God has a a bouquet of flowers God wanted me like this God want God wanted you like that but that's only what we can see we are actually logos Sons because that's what our father is amen what a privilege to have faith in our souls to believe that amen this message is not skin [Music] milk this message is in other words this word has not being watered down by denomination but we believe that this message is the mystery of God that he has in his mind before the foundation of the world and I think we should never get used to the truth that in this hour we can put our arms around around the mystery of God and I can shake hands with the mystery of God Amen knowing that this flesh will perish but there's something in there that is eternal as God is amen because in the beginning he called their name Adam so in this end time he calls their name Jesus he is the further expression of the Almighty I am God and when we really catch what's between the lines it makes it so personal not what we can achieve but what God already has achieved but is just now being revealed to him bride so we can know the truth and believe the truth and it will just bring us to a deeper love for Jesus and a deeper love for my brother amen so I'm so happy to be here with you precious people it has been an honor to to assist Pastor Gary and to see the purchas of the blood of Jesus in Uganda so greetings from Australia Australia and I'm sure I will take back greetings from UGA we love you and we appreciate you and when we go back home we're going to press on in jesus' name on that side of the planet while you're pressing on in jesus' name on this side amen and it's not over until we win amen hallelujah hallelujah I'm going to turn over to past Gary God bless you richly God bless you brothers and sisters praise the Lord are you happy this evening amen let's take our Bibles and we will get straight to work and while you turn into Ephesians Ephesians chapter one I also want to bring you greetings from Australia again it did not take long to fall in love with the bride Uganda I also want to brother we only just met five minutes ago in but we're brothers and again I want to appreciate brother bazzi for his his kind invitation praise the Lord I happy amen can you say hallelujah hallelujah amen we're gathered in Jesus name amen so I'm reading from Philippians chapter 1 and verse 6 and the word of the Lord says being confident of this very thing I want to speak on confidence without ego confidence without ego being confident of this very thing that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it unto the day of Jesus Christ brother BR said what makes fear is a lack of confidence if you have confidence there should be no fear what makes what makes fear is a lack of confidence let's bow our heads in word Lord Jesus father we're gathered here this afternoon to receive instruction from your word I thank you in advance for what you about to do in our lives speak to us father we give you the preeminence in Jesus name amen amen amen God bless you you may be seated confidence we need to be confident in who we are you hear sometimes a Pentecostal preacher he will scream out the battle is the Lords and the untrained Church will say amen and the preacher will scream out the battle is the Lord and the untrained church will scream out amen God is sitting in his high heaven and he looks over to Gabriel says haven't they read Ephesians 6 the battle is not the Lord's the battle is yours that's why you must be born again in the Psalms Psalms 352 says arise oh Lord put on belt and Buckler and shield destroy our enemies oh Lord and Theus took great joy knowing that the battle was the Lord but in heaven sent us a perfect sacrifice so that the blood cell could be split and when the blood cell was split God released himself into his hous and now God says put on the helmet of salvation take a hold of the sword of the Lord put on the breastplate of Faith see that your feet are shod with the preparation of the because we fight against principalities of the battle is not the Lords the battle is yours God doesn't want to change your situation God wants to change your perspective God can change your perspective you can change the situation the battle is yours you have a responsibility you've been called here for a purpose and we need to be confident without ego need to believe in yourself being confident of this one thing that he which started the good work will finish it till the day of Jesus Christ and this is the day of Jesus Christ brother Bram said this is the age of this is the age of the personal life of Christ this is what God has been waiting for this is your time this is your purpose is your calling battle is not the Lord hear ye him brother Bram took a lot of confidence in in the Visions he said I just love the Visions because I know what's going to happen in the vision and he's crying out oh Lord what must I do give me a vision and God said must I give you a vision isn't it written in the word there's a whole crop coming that don't have visions the bride in the last day is going to base her faith in the word I'm not waiting for a vision it's already been told me all things are possible to them that believe and if God is for us who can be against so the battle is yours God's relying on you to change the situation that's why you must be born again amen from the beginning God had counseled his own purpose he had a Plan of Salvation and that was towards his elect for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and when his only begotten son got here his only begotten son said father I do not pray for the world I pray for them that you sent me who he was sent to that's the world that God loves God so love the world that's the El that's the household of God Jesus was sent so the blood cell could be split and when the blood cell was broken God released himself back into so there's no need to scream the battle is the Lord God will say haven't you read Ephesians batt God said I have empowered you I've given you the baptism of the Holy Ghost I've told you there's nothing impossible to change your perspective and when your perspective is changed you can change the situation lo I come to do thy will oh God it's written of me in the volumes of the book I come to do thy will brother Bram said you are the words in the book you are the words in the book and the book was sealed for 2000 years the Holy Ghost is loosed the bride stepping out of the book you're not a Doctrine you're a person a Son of God a Son of God you are a son of God God is relying on you to act like a Son of God brother ROM said God's very existence is for his own and brother said God is working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will you are not in the situation by mistake this is design you are here for a purpose and you are in the situation that you are in for a purpose because God's relying on you change your thoughts change your perspective rise and shine Shake yourself from the dust of the earth and change the situation confidence you have to believe in who you are you have to believe in yourself and you're going to have to be the best version of you it's your life you might as well work it to your benefit it's your life you might as well be the star in your own life don't be a spectator in your own life take charge of your own life nobody else can be used only you can be used and God designed you to be used so your might well go ahead and be the best version of you goded you to be amen can you say Amen in Mark in Mark 10 blind was sitting on the roadside B and he heard that Jesus was passing by and he screamed out son of David have mercy on me and the Bible says Jesus stopped Jesus Stood Still everybody else had told blind bmas be quiet but if you know Jesus is passing he screamed out all the more Jesus Son of David have mercy on me and Jesus stopped Jesus Stood Still and said hey bring him here and as soon as blind Bas heard that the first thing he did was he cast aside his garments the first thing he did was cast away His Garment because the council had issued him the Garment to be a legitimate beggar you had to stand before the council hisory tells us if the council deemed you a legitimate beggar Council would issue you Beggar's garment and as soon as he has said as soon as he heard Jesus they bring him here the first thing he did was cast away the gun he said I'm not going to be a beggar anymore Jesus says come here then I don't need a Beggar's garment he said if I can get to Jesus then I can do it myself if I can get to Jesus get rid of this Beggar's attitude when I receive my spiritual eyesight I can finish the job brother Bram said I think he's waiting for us to finish the job don't cry the battle is the Lord no no no you beggar don't be a beggar pass the away the beggar G you're a Son of God Redeemed by the blood of God God has released himself back into his household you're not a beggar be confident be confident that you are a son and if you are a son then Heaven backs you up amen amen amen hallelujah amen so we started with justification we moved on into sanctification we received the baptism that which was started is performed brother said this is the age of the complete this is the age of the complete this is the this is the age of Life the personal life of Jesus Christ amen can you say Amen God's got a master of his family back on the Earth again you know when Michelangelo took that lump of B and he was going to create Moses he never created Moses Moses was always in the Rock his job was to remove all the unnecessary part expose the Masterpiece that was already there his job was to unveil the Masterpiece all we're doing is going through life moving that unnecessary path trials the tribulations when life sideswipes you it's just God giving you an opportunity to remove the unnecessary to remove the beggar's attitude to remove the entitlement spirits and to be the Masterpiece that always was because brother brandom said you're just as Eternal as God is we're not created we are revealed Hallelujah we are not forgiven we're redeemed you've got to be confident confident in who you are confidence without ego you can stand and say am I come to do thy will oh God it's written of me the of the book The Prophet said you are the words in the book be confidence confence amen this is the age of the completion after this there's nothing this is the conclusion of the drama God hiding himself in Simplicity but he which began a good work in you who perfect it will perfect it and the reason he's perfecting it because he changed his mask he's imori himself he's poured himself into his his bride so this is the age of Life the age of the personal life of Jesus Christ amen is he still working on us of course he's still working on us amen but there's coming a time when enough is enough and the dead rise and we which are alive and remain shall we change in the blink of an be confident don't don't fear being left behind remember it's a revelation when the time is right it will be revealed to you and when it's revealed you don't need Hebrews 11 fath when it's revealed it's a perfect Faith you're going to know that you know that you know it's going home time remember perfect faith is a faith that needs no faith amen can you say Amen so is is he still working on us of course he's still working amen but remember Jeremiah 1 God said before I formed before I formed you I knew you got I said to Job where were you when the sons of God presented themselves job should have said I was there when job was suffering when job was feeling sorry for himself God said J where were you when the sons of God presented before the before right at the beginning when you were chosen in me when there was nothing else me job should have said I was there and I knew this was coming but because it's locked in my subconscious I'm I'm feeling sorry for myself but when you hear Jesus say bring him here throw away your biggest gar throw away your begg's attitude throw away that entitlement spirit say he from now on if I get in the presence of Jesus I get my eyesight back I can finish the job the battle's not the L the battle mine God wants to change me that I can change the situation amen God said Jeremiah before I formed Thee I knew you amen before God formed you before God put you in this body you were somewhere hallelujah amen he said Jeremiah before I formed you I knew you and God said that because he knew Jeremiah chapter 20 was coming when Jeremiah was later on in his ministry he started feeling sorry for him he started noticing that the unbelievers had better houses and he started knowing the denominations had better cars and he started feeling sorry for himself and he said I'm no longer going to speak in the name of the Lord I'm no longer going to speak in the name of the Lord because I'm feeling sorry for myself he said but it didn't last long he said because there's a fire locked up in my bones the Fire won't go out there's a fire in my Bon and the Fire won't go out I have times I have times and you have times when you're feeling sorry for yourself and God says hey before I formed you knew you and the fire the fire starts to burn you say oh that was just I was just having a bad moment but I'm not going to be a beggar I'm going to be son so when you hit Jeremiah chapter 20 don't forget Jeremiah chapter 1 before I found you I knew you that's why I died for you the blood shell was broken for you so that I could release myself back into my house don't weep John don't weep John the lion of the tribe of Judah has amen and if Jesus Christ is the author in the fin of your Fai then you need to read you like he wrote you I didn't get it read you like he [Music] wrote amen you're the words in the book read you like he wrote brother brand said this is the age of apostasy and this is the age of restoration in this age this is the age of the finished cycle with this it's all over again the prophet said when it looks like everything has gone wrong God is giving you a tri but he's got confidence in [Music] you and if God's got confidence in you then you need to have confidence in you confidence without ego so when it looks like everything has gone wrong God's giving you a trial God loves to test his people amen remember when you were at school all year you can interact with the teacher say to the teacher what does this mean what's the rule of mathematics and you can interact with the teacher all year you can interact but at the end of the year you have to take a test and when you're taking your test you can't talk to the teacher the teacher has to remain silent silence is not absence silence is testing amen so just throw away the beggar's garments either feel sorry for your self attitude rise and shine and be the man or the woman that God has designed you to be a master peace and Overcomer to have confidence God's Got Confidence so you might as well go ahead and have confidence in [Music] [Applause] yourself just remember silence is not absence silence is testing when your back is up against the wall and you're praying and you're praying and you're praying and God's not talking to you nothing's wrong it's a test don't walk away don't cry don't feel sorry for yourself it's a test be confident be confident in this one thing that he would started it is the that's going to finish God is [Applause] becoming this is the age of life this is the age of the personal life of Jesus Christ Amen brother BR says in the rising of the sun says hallelujah hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people talking about the pillar of fire waved over the people and the first time they will come forth to the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again into its full power being waved over the people why is it waved over the people this is the first of a whole crop that's coming the pillar of fire was waved over the people because every son and every daughter is a God Son you are the word remember chosen in him when there was nothing else to choose from but himself that means when God chose you he chose himself that means when you show up God CH thank God for the message thank God for the message you know the prophet said paragraph 2 57 257 of the of of shalom shalom 1964 when he preached it in Sierra paragraph 257 got L on paragraph 256 [Music] of the sermon Shalom preached in 1964 the prophet said are you following the shadow now remember the shadows of a previous Revival Always mockingly Dance Before the open door of the current [Music] Revelation he's talking about the dark of denomination he said are you following the darkness or are you appearing with the light or are you appearing with the light he said job where were you when the sons of God presented themselves you see Jeremiah before I formed I knew you are you following the darkness or are you appearing with the light you're appearing with the light that's why you can't unbeli the message it's just just just no doubt you cannot unbeli the message because it is you it is who you are amen can you dis believe you're a human being there be something mentally wrong you need a psychiatric assessment you know you're a human being but you need to know you are the light you are the purif you need to have confidence in who you are confidence without ego no devil can stand before you if you know who you are it doesn't matter what someone says you're not confidence without ego amen amen Hebrews chapter 10 verse 35 says cast not away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward great recompense of reward if you can be confident in your calling sure if you're sure if you know that you know that you came from God and that you must go back then there really isn't a situation there's just an obstacle to [Music]

the unveiling this is the unveiling of God God said hey before I formed you I knew you why did God know you because you were chosen in him not in front of him not behind in him when there was nothing else to choose and now the Lord himself hey are you following that shadow or are you appearing with the light these are the words of a prophet I didn't say it I didn't write it I'm quoting it the prophet said are you following the shadow are you airing with the light amen lo I come to do thy will oh God confidence confidence is the inner knowledge that you are capable of a certain thing this is who you are 2 years ago Jesus said who do men say that now I'm asking you who do you say you [Music] are I tell you what brother R said you're the Messiah [Applause] brother BR said you're the Christ of the S the prophet said it's the same Jesus but in the bride form who do you say you are and if you haven't heard it before if Jesus is passing by just scream out son of David have mercy on me because when the bride sees it the Rapture will go this is not religion this is not church this is not organized religion this is Christ in bright form conf [Music] amen amen amen are you happy Amen brother brandom said I love quing the prophet I'm not going to get myself in any [Music] trouble the prophet said and as you walk you have confidence that the Life of Christ is in you and you are in him Jesus said in that day which is this day brother tells us Christ is the mystery of God revealed that Revelation was waiting for today Jesus said in that day you will know that I am in you and you are in me the fullness of me in you and the fullness of you and me Blended together the prophet said that is what the token is he said the token is you and Jesus as a person [Music] together so there is a confidence that belongs to the children of God we can have the absolute assurance that we are saved we are redeemed we are going back to where we came an absolute Assurance amen God doesn't want you scared God doesn't want you nervous you know when the first son was here Jesus of Nazareth brother B tells us he contended with himself he had to come to grips and what he was brother B explains it in the church age book and he explains it in the sermon perfect Fai he could only come to realize who he was by what the word said he thought he was just a man you thought you were just a man Angels were come to minister to Jesus and Angels come to minister to J and Angels would say Hey you are the Christ and Jesus would say I'm a carpenter God was found fashioned as a man right one one of us one of us and Angels would say you're the Christ and he would say I'm a carpenter I frame doors I frame windows I frame houses and the angels would say no you frame worlds you spike it all into you were in the beginning you came from God you'll be going back to you have a job you have a purpose and brother R said he had to contend with and that's exactly what we do with ourselves you've got all the evidence on the negative side you cannot be the Christ but God sends Angels it says you were in the beginning before God formed you he knew you and he ordained you and he placed you here you are different from the first Eve the first Eve fell Jesus brought fell God said this is not going to happen again I'm going to become my own Lord himself shouts him with a voice with a shout the Trum of the Angel brother BR said watch the order of the rapture and brother said he said right now we are in the final session of this coming we are in the coming when Jesus was here the coming of the Lord was 33 and a half years long we are in the coming we are in the Rapture waiting for a change of the body already why because you're a millennium person right [Applause] now you are the first fruits of the Millennium you are a millennium man locked up in the wrong body when the body is changed in a moment twinkling of and I step into my right body the first fruit Millennium have confidence God has confidence you have confidence don't be scared if Jesus is passing just cry out son of David have mercy on me and when you can see it brother brandham said Jesus got to apply place where he so seen it he recognized who he was and we need to so see it and when we so see it I'm going to throw away my beggar I'm going to throw away my council issue I'm going to throw away my bad attitude say I come to do thy will oh God amen can you think of Jesus contending with himself wrestling with the idea of his true identity we are contending recognizing our day and its message spiritual amnesia is a case of stolen identity if we can see who we really are not the form not the form but the part the world that God loves you are the world that God loves amen I've anchored my soul in the Haven of Rest [Music] blessed amen why because he would began a good work is able to finish to the day of Jesus Christ and this is the day of Jesus Christ this is the age of Life the age of the personal life of Jesus Christ the same Jesus in the bright form amen can you say Amen confident people feel secure confident people don't feel insecure so I'm talking about confidence without ego insecure people will always call secure people NIS insecure people will look at secure people and say they have an inflated sense of selfworth but if you know who you are it doesn't matter people say you're not let the insecure people let the Pentecostals let the denomination let the doubters and let the fers call you narcistic but in the way they call heresy is the way I choose to worship amen amen the prophet said and what makes fear is a lack of confidence if you lack confidence it will make you fear and Jesus said fear not in other words Jesus is saying be confident he said fear not little flock the insecure people they will call you fanatic insecure people will say you've gone too far insecure people will say you're adding to or you're taking away but if you know who you are it does not matter secure people tell that you're [Applause] not real genuine love love brother BR said will create confidence amen amen confident people don't spend time blaming others confident people look for Solutions rather than trying to win arguments was that was a good one write that one down confident people look for Solutions rather than winning arguments the only reason you want to win an argument is to feed your ego while you go ahead and say [Music] Amen insecure people will call secure people amen but confident people are able to learn from their mistakes the mistake is not your enemy the mistake is your teacher [Applause] hallelu confident people learn from their mistakes they don't blame others they BL they don't blame environments they don't blame situations they have enough character look for a solution look for a solution that that the fault the fault is not your enemy the desire is not your enemy the situation is not your enemy they are your teacher and secure people confident people just look at the fault and learn from it amen amen Cast Away the biggest garment blind Bas was confident if I get in the presence of Jesus I don't need this G so we thank Jesus for what he has done and we thank Jesus for what he's doing and we thank Jesus for what he's about to do confident people know that all things work together for the good confident people have a fire in their bones that won't go out I'm not here to promote myself I'm here to promote the word the purpose of God is to bring forth the people like amen amen can you say [Music] Amen Proverbs chapter 3 verse 26 says for the Lord shall be thy confidence the Lord is your confidence I'm not talking about human confidence I'm talking about supernatural de deity your DNA your spiritual DNA deity you have the genes of your father so if God is gracious the bride will be gracious if God is confident the bride will be conf if God can forgive the bride can forgive if God is not nervous then the bride should be fear not in other words be confident confidence with ego confident people are not timid I said confident people are not amen the key to confidence is preparation right amen the prophet said he said preparation he sent us the messenger with the message we have been given preparation we have been given the message of the hour and if God was good enough to give it to you good enough to study it it's your life it's your calling be the best version of you that you can be you can only be the star in your own life when you know what you're talking about and the prophet said you have to know the word you've got to know the word preparation preparation he sent the messenger with the message and this message is a message of of identification the biggest killer the biggest killer of selfconfidence is comparing yourself with somebody else don't worry about somebody else don't stand on the sideline of your own life don't be the observer in your life your get on with it it's your life your might as well be happy it's your life your might as well change the situation it's your life you can change your mind you can change your attitude you change at your so your M will be the star don't comp yourself with somebody else hey they are busy getting on with their life don't sing the song Count Their Blessings name them one by one Count Their Blessings what God has done now count your own blessings mind your own business and get on with being you you are a masterpiece this is the unveiling of God you can be unstoppable why because all things possible and and of God before us who can be against be unstoppable confidence without ego amen the Fire won't go out the storm will not last what you're looking for might be what you're looking at [Applause] amen amen first John 3:21 says beloved if your heart condemn us not then have confidence towards God that's why I say you've got to settle the sin question are you listening to me now really sign the enemy cannot make you feel inferior without your that's true amen why were you offended you say they offended me no no your emotions allowed it your pride allowed it ego allowed it the enemy cannot make you feel inferior unless you consent to it so be confident fear not the Lord himself has descended in the bride form Adam's wife fell Jesus wife fell and God said that will not happen again I will become I will become I'm going to change my MTH and God says before I formed you cuz you were in me watch your you're looking for might be what you're looking at confidence without ego you're going to have to stand confidence in what Calvary achieved for you Jesus Christ Heaven's perfect sacrifice when the blood cell was brok all my sins all my you see God needed to deal with the devil God needed to go to hell God cannot go to hell brother said just the smallest amount he said angels are filthy in his eyes God Is So holy that righteous angels are filthy in his eyes but God said I got to deal with he said I'm I'm going to I'm going to make up a plan and of course we say that to paint a picture in our mind because he knew all things right at the beginning God has never had another thought too great to have more thoughts so God said in the drama I'm going to get to hell and I'm going to sort this thing out once and for all but I can't go it's me so God became a man and Jesus Christ could not go to hell because he come he was sinless but God could put my he could go so that at Calvary the father said to the son and brother brandham said he had to wait till he was niled to the Cross he said son I am too holy to be with you for what is about to heaven I'm turning my back on you CU I am too righteous to be around you for what is about to happen and God turned us back and all your sin all your sin all my sin was poured upon heaven and he died of a broken heart but he descended and he took all my sin took all your sin to hell and when he rose I rose with him but I Rose he for my I I without so when he appears the second time he appears without s you are here brother Bram said he has appeared he's appeared in his and if he has appeared the second time he has appeared without sin I don't care what you did Brother Bram said I don't care what you did it's impossible for you to be a sinner that's the power of the blood and God did that so that he could release himself back into a sinless bride amen amen can you say Amen the prophet said the only real Sin is to doubt it shut up just accept what God has done for you so the enemy cannot make you feel inferior without your consent because God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and a sound of mind and a sound mind you can only feel offended if you have a weak [Music] mind you can only feel inferior if you have a weak mind God did not give us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind who do you say you are brother BR said how can he sin when a perfect sacrifice is lying in his place I didn't get it and the prophet said God never looks at me he looks at Christ Hallelujah again prop how can he sin when the sinless God is in him the prophet said no matter what he's done the blood covers him amen am the Overcomer of L God said you'll St with me and I'll with you brother Bram said that means for the Overcomer God will tell you who he is and he wants you to tell him who you are and the prophet said what a wonderful day when I saw I was not the child of Charles and El [Music] Branham but I was a child of God and if you're a child of God you have the DNA of God you the deity of God and God says there going to come a time you stop talking nonsense and just tell me who you are he says yes I know there is a time of contending but there's got to come a time when you can see it and how you going to see it when Angels minister to you amen can you say Amen Naomi she said to Ruth Ruth you get yourself down the threshing floor and I want you to lay at the feet of boas all night I want you on the threshing floor with Bo and in the morning when Ruth came home Naomi said who are you my daughter Naomi knew exactly that that was Ruth but she's saying she's saying are you Ruth of moabites or are you now Mrs who are you who do you say you are sitting in the water will not make you a fish sitting in the garage will not make you a car sitting in church will not make you a Son of God you always were a Son of God and the prophet you were never [Applause] lost amen me the prophet said how can he sin when it can't be seen even by God so there should be no there should be no condemnation there should only be confidence amen conviction is different from condemnation conviction just brings repentance but there should be no condemnation all we need to do is make our space safe make your space safe make your environment to for spiritual growth Jesus Jesus never stayed in safe places but he made his space safe you need a word environment if the plant is not growing don't fix the plant fix the environment amen if you're not maturing as a Christian secure people don't blame the church secure people they going to look around and they're going to learn from their mistakes if you do something and it doesn't work so you do it again and it still doesn't work and you do it again and it still doesn't work you do it again and it still doesn't work until you say hey I'm going to do it again maybe it'll work this time you are in do something that works God gave us a sound mind make your space safe create a word environment around you don't go blaming anybody else make your space safe and it's your responsibility to silence all the negative voices don't blame the pastor don't blame the Deacon blame the church that's for insecure people secure people can take responsibility secure people have a confidence without an ego the prophet said love the prophet said it's the full word of God the promise of this hour manifest made manifest and the prophet said when God thought of you in the beginning when God thought of you he thought of himself being tangible so now the full word has returned in its full power because it's loosed in the even time and now it's in full manifestation called The Bride of Jesus Christ and here we sit contending if Jesus contended don't feel insufficient because you are contain when you were saying I thought was the son of Brian and Jane Walker walk I thought I was the master of my own destiny but the word says I came from God and the word says the word says the word says I'm contending now who you going to listen to who do you say you are you cannot be good unless you have bad in you if you don't have any bad in you you're not good you're just Angelic God's got lots of angels he doesn't want more Angels he wants Overcomers he wants Sons if good overcomes bad now you're good but if you're going to be good you've got to have bad in you and now I'm contending with the bad before I was born again when I was all by myself I was in Bad Company but then Jesus Jus came and now the battle starts and now the battle starts feel like a walking Civil War the reason I feel like a walking Civil War Two Worlds in me fighting and the only way for me to be good is to overcome bad if you've got no bed I don't believe you if you've got no bed you're useless to the kingdom if you've got no bad you're a pretender the Pharisees they were they were actors they were just they were just acting but in the pressure time the Pharisees would just fall apart why you're not an actor you're the of Jesus Christ you say oh my goodness I have bad in me of course you've got bad in you wake up of course you've got bad in now God wants you to overcome B and prove that the Lord himself has descended and become his own bride this is De with personal issues this is the S of God sat has never seen [Applause] before contending for sure we're contending if you're not contending you're an actor you're a pretender you're useless you're not functional in the Kingdom you've got bad in you welcome to [Applause] church Ephesians chapter 3 says according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him my faith is God's faith my confidence is God's confidence God knew me before he he formed me so what you're looking for might be what you're looking atus is Deus is dead and I'm glad you've got an issue can you say I'm glad oh you've got bad in you can you say I'm glad it might last this is temporary we're going to be changed soon and the only way for you to prove your love is in unlovable circum do you have an issue are you glad it's an opportunity to prove your love are you wrestling with bed are you glad it's your only opportunity love is proved in unlovable circum let me give you an example on a hill far away stood an Old Rugged Cross God was proving his love for us in unlovable he said Lazarus is dead and I'm glad I'm glad for the glory of God you got an issue for the glory of God for the glory of God did you get offended that's cuz you allowed it because youve got a weak mind just be glad this is the day that the Lord has made we shall be glad and rejoice in it that everything that has breath praise ye the Lord confidence fear not confidence with who do you say you are amen amen Amen brother Bram says you've got to be the full word you have got to be the full word for you are a part of him amen amen amen let me close with this final are you [Applause] happy now if what I say uh is uh if you don't agree with what I'm about to say you have to blame brother Buzz because he invited me every sin that you ever committed you enjoyed it'd make no sense to do it if you didn't like it right so I'm talking about confidence I'm talking about dealing with a sin issue every sin you committed you enjoyed because brother Ram said sin is attractive it's enjoyable that's why you did it because it make no sense to do something you don't enjoy therefore God rich in Mercy knowing that we don't want to enjoy we don't want to enjoy ourselves in sin God produced a bleach God knows that you hate the thing you love because there's two 's one loves the world and the other one loves the word yeah it can only be good if you've got bad in you so God knows God rich in mercy God knows you hate the thing that you love every sin you committed you enjoy it CU you've got bad in you don't look at me like that don't be a Pharisee get real get honest and things will work [Music] out but while you're pretending that nothing is wrong in condemnation but there should be no condemnation to them that are in Christ so God knows you hate the things that you love yeah you love it bad loves it good has a responsibility become bad but bad is not the enemy bad is is the teacher you're not becoming a masterpiece you're not becoming a you always were a masterpiece this is the unveiling of God Amen made no sense made no sense to sin if you didn't enjoy it [Music] so now we have an obstacle to overcome brother Brown said what happens immediately the black stain is gone you take the back stain and you put it into bleach the black ink is turned into to bleach the sin was turned into Grace amen amen just have a think of it just go with the quotes just go with the quotes brother B said if you put the ink into the bleach said the ink turns into bleach he said the power of the bleach reass reassembles the molecules of the ink it makes it a bleach molecule right so the more ink you put into the bleach the more bleach you get [Applause] God rich in Mercy the prophet said what happens immediately the black stain is gone you can't find it again if you had to gone you'll never find it again again the prophet said what happens to the son he becomes in perfect fellowship with the father again standing on the other side of the chasm with no remembrance of sin anymore amen again the prophet said he that believes not he that believes not the full word that's a sinner only is to doubt it the only sin is to doubt yourself have confidence in who and what you are Jesus had to wrestle with it himself if I was an apple tree and I grew and I matured and I sprouted apples and one of the apples fell on the ground and through a process of time enough water and enough light roted another tree would come okay so that tree there you can say I am and I can say [Music] you can say I am to carried away with that you're actually me over there [Music] God will say get too carried away you're actually me amen God stretched his tent and became a man that man was God the man thought he was just the man but God knew you are me over there you have to deal with it to deal with the fact yourself you are me over there and God is saying who are you Ruth Mo or Mrs Bo you have to deal with it you have to get confident with yourself you have to believe in who you are you have to become [Applause] Unstoppable this is who you are God of the audience God becoming God manifested In the Flesh God tangible you have to deal with it you have amen amen can you say hallelujah hallelujah deal with it you are not your own you are brought with a price you're not your own you are God here you are deity with issues deity bad in you and this is the side of God that Satan has never seen before no wonder heaven was silence brother said they couldn't believe it were God had become a man God God became one man but now God wants to become a house and nobody knew what to do in heaven heaven was silent they they just didn't know what to say nobody could praise nobody could sing nobody could use an instrument that deity was going to have issues [Music] [Applause] hallelujah amen believe believe in God believe in Jesus believe believe God's Prophet believe in yourself Church there's something in you that can be unstoppable and what is that that's the John that came to John that's the you that wants to speak to you there's something in
