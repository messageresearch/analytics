[58:50] [Music]
[59:03] then she developed
[59:06] an addiction to the medicine that were
[59:08] given
[59:23] so uh i got to know that she had started
[59:26] giving the injection to herself through
[59:29] the legs
[59:50] she was always very depressed and she
[59:52] would not have sleep
[1:00:22] she told me that
[1:00:23] i feel i want to
[1:00:25] give up
[1:00:27] something like i want just take poison
[1:00:35] there it means that my medical health
[1:00:38] was no longer
[1:02:03] [Music]
[1:02:46] foreign
[1:02:47] [Music]
[1:02:59] museum
[1:03:30] [Music]
[1:03:50] but spiritually speaking those are
[1:03:52] demons
[1:03:54] and the him you would understand if you
[1:03:57] know
[1:03:58] [Music]
[1:04:04] you know the prophet was given two signs
[1:04:06] he would get his hand right turned into
[1:04:08] your left hand and the vibrations would
[1:04:11] catch them you know that this is the
[1:04:13] spirit causing this disease
[1:04:30] [Music]
[1:04:33] that is it so when i was checking the
[1:04:35] blood to see is this person see
[1:04:38] they don't
[1:05:07] indicates
[1:05:09] that i talk about it a bit yes
[1:05:12] so um
[1:05:15] there are variables on the cbc which
[1:05:17] indicates they were able to respond to
[1:05:21] microorganisms and we can know this is
[1:05:24] bacteria
[1:05:25] virus
[1:05:26] inflammatory reaction
[1:05:28] uh protozoa like that
[1:05:31] baby
[1:05:53] maybe
[1:05:55] somehow someone will have a small trace
[1:05:56] of bacteria although it may not be able
[1:05:59] to make you very sick yes
[1:07:12] is
[1:07:40] very sick

[1:08:06] this one god is showing the power of
[1:08:08] prayer what
[1:08:11] [Music]
[1:08:22] but me i appreciate it because now i
[1:08:24] know what it means
[1:08:27] uh pathologically and after prayer
[1:08:35] no more
[1:08:54] [Music]
[1:09:00] because this was very strange to me but
[1:09:03] i would wanted to prove
[1:09:18] you've read that message
[1:09:24] so when they are praying for someone and
[1:09:25] they are chasing those bad spirits and
