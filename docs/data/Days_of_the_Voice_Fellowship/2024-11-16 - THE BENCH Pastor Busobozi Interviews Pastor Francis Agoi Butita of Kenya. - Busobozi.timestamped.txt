[5:52] alike um for if the Lord Tes there's
[5:56] quite a lot that uh the next generation
[5:59] will want to to hear and to learn about
[6:01] how God dealt with these brothers that
[6:04] first believed in the message in our
[6:07] region here in East Africa and so allow
[6:11] me uh to welcome you sir thank you uh
[6:15] well we are so blessed to have you today
[6:17] here at the at the bench and to be able
[6:20] to talk to you if you would please
[6:22] kindly greet the people God bless you so
[6:25] happy to be here and to talk to you I
[6:29] know God is has a purpose he going to
[6:31] bless us together amen
[6:34] amen uh Pastor Francis I did not uh like
[6:39] I told the people here in the church
[6:42] that uh uh myself and yourself are
[6:45] Generations AP part but somehow the Lord
[6:47] was able to uh connect us and bring us
[6:50] together in such uh I should say
[6:52] Supernatural way because personally I
[6:54] did not know of you um being that um I'm
[6:58] much younger and and was start just
[7:01] starting out but um like I informed the
[7:04] people here at the church I got to learn
[7:06] of you and of the
[7:08] ministry uh in Western Kenya from one of
[7:12] ours our brother
[7:13] Timothy um who at the time had come to
[7:17] be with us in Ethiopia at that time I
[7:19] was with my wife and the family in
[7:21] Ethiopia so he happened also to be
[7:23] working there and we were able to link
[7:25] up with him and then he told us of of
[7:27] yourself and that's how how we got to
[7:29] learn of you
[7:32] um and I'm sure there are many people
[7:34] who do perhaps the younger ones also who
[7:36] do not know of course the older ones
[7:38] know know you but there are many younger
[7:40] ones that do not know you and um so
[7:45] there many questions I have I'm just
[7:47] trying to see where to start from okay
[7:49] but I think we will start from the very
[7:52] basic
[7:53] question uh how did you become a
[7:56] Christian let us begin there thank you
[7:59] thank you uh first of all if you have
[8:02] heard Pastor Francis
[8:05] atita uh from the western part of
[8:09] Kenya and uh the journey to be a
[8:12] Christian is a wonderful
[8:15] Journey um first of
[8:17] all from my
[8:25] youth
[8:27] school well it did something to my heart
[8:29] because somehow I had the the feeling of
[8:32] a god being
[8:33] somewhere but it it didn't take me to be
[8:36] a
[8:37] Christian so around the 10 age I think I
[8:43] went off I went off and by around
[8:47] 1970
[8:49] 7170 I went I went into deep world I
[8:53] drunk and smoked did
[8:56] everything but God is very gracious
[8:59] around 1972 just
[9:03] around around the turning on on of
[9:07] June something happened to my life that
[9:10] I can't
[9:11] explain it was as if I'm
[9:14] sick is as if I'm not I'm not sick I
[9:18] could not explain what I was the feeling
[9:20] was terrible but I wasn't sick I wasn't
[9:22] in
[9:23] pain and I I even went to the hospital
[9:26] they could not give me the the
[9:28] treatment so I was in school and I took
[9:31] off leave to go home and maybe find help
[9:35] but at home I didn't get help so I lay
[9:38] there on on my my bed from Monday
[9:42] Tuesday Wednesday I wasn't feeling okay
[9:45] the feeling had not left me on Friday I
[9:50] felt I must go back to
[9:51] school and I convinced my mother to let
[9:54] me go back to school so I went back to
[9:56] school when I went back to school
[9:59] I found that there was a a Pentecostal
[10:01] old man
[10:04] European who worked with the what used
[10:06] to be called the Trinity Fellowship okay
[10:09] he was called Mr doit he had a
[10:11] missionary to schools and to colleges in
[10:14] our country so that evening he had
[10:18] brought a film in our school okay I
[10:22] understood there was a film to be shown
[10:24] at the hall so I went there just like
[10:27] anybody else I didn't know this is now
[10:28] 197 72 1972 June that was 24th okay June
[10:34] so when I went to the
[10:35] hall there comes the this old man with a
[10:39] film and he puts on Billy gaham
[10:42] preaching in a crusade in Texas
[10:45] okay uh my heart seemed to have found
[10:48] what I was looking
[10:49] for and I was glued to the to the to the
[10:53] screen and as bil Graham would preach
[10:55] and would point a finger I would see him
[10:57] as if was pointing at me
[11:00] and I got I I wondered what what what is
[11:02] it so towards the end of the film when
[11:06] the the film ended yes I made a prayer I
[11:10] said God speak to this man to ask those
[11:13] who want to be save and for sure he
[11:15] asked for those want to be Sav and quite
[11:18] a number of the students more than maybe
[11:21] 100 moved to the
[11:22] front and he led us in what he
[11:25] called uh a prayer for the for salvation
[11:29] I did not pray that
[11:31] prayer as he he led the other boys into
[11:34] praying that prayer I was deeply praying
[11:37] and pleading with God to forgive my
[11:40] sins and just before he finished I don't
[11:42] know what happened I don't know how I
[11:44] knew it I said God if you have forgiven
[11:47] my sins fill me with the Holy Ghost
[11:51] now and something happened that I could
[11:53] not explain I felt such a power come
[11:56] upon my my my my my body right from the
[12:01] head into inside me as if some was
[12:04] pouring some good cool atmosphere into
[12:08] my soul and such a peace rested in my
[12:12] heart so after that I went to The Bard
[12:14] and I told him something has happened to
[12:16] me I don't know what it is and he told
[12:19] me there are two possibilities either an
[12:22] evil spirit or the Holy Ghost but we
[12:24] going to do this we are going to pray
[12:26] together if it is the Holy Ghost
[12:29] go to let him settle in your life and
[12:32] use you so we did pray with the old man
[12:36] and from there on my life was
[12:38] transformed amen the things I used to
[12:41] love I found I didn't love them anymore
[12:44] I used to love worldly music it didn't
[12:47] have t to me anymore in fact I went to
[12:49] the doet and when one of the one one of
[12:52] the boys was playing the music I Found
[12:55] the courage tell him to stop and he did
[12:58] and from in fact the next day everybody
[13:00] was looking at me in school with a very
[13:02] strange you know look MH something had
[13:06] happened from then I knew I was say yeah
[13:10] praise the lord well uh um first of all
[13:14] before we I comment on what just said if
[13:16] I can just request our
[13:18] listeners brothers and sisters if you
[13:21] can please share this link with all the
[13:23] others that would like to uh listen to
[13:26] this testimony because there are many
[13:28] many things that are about to be Sav
[13:30] that is going to turn your life around
[13:32] and change you and uh give you
[13:34] perspective especially about this
[13:36] message to be able to understand where
[13:38] we are where we have arrived what God is
[13:41] doing because what God did in the lives
[13:43] of others he also can be able to do in
[13:45] our life today in our generation and so
[13:49] if you can share this link with
[13:51] whichever group you are in and share
[13:52] with your friends invite them to come
[13:54] and be a part a part of this interview
[13:57] um one thing that is that really has
[13:59] always moved me uh is the
[14:02] humility and the sincerity of of Mo most
[14:06] of the oldtimers most of the brothers
[14:08] the oldtimers like our precious Pastor
[14:10] here Francis V very very humble people
[14:13] and it's not humility that is put on you
[14:16] can see is real sincerity coming from
[14:19] the heart and as you had that testimony
[14:22] you know God visited him and moved in
[14:24] his life now this is remember before the
[14:27] message came this before he even learned
[14:29] of the message this is just how he
[14:31] became a Christian so as we will hear
[14:34] later on how the message came to him and
[14:36] how he received the revelation of the
[14:37] word he had already been a true
[14:39] Christian in his heart and and changed
[14:42] filled the Holy Ghost and the life of
[14:44] the world already left
[14:46] him now um Pastor
[14:50] Francis uh you you you you receive a
[14:54] conversion in that moment you were a
[14:56] student at school I don't know how old
[14:57] you were at the time was about 18 18 and
[15:00] so did you become a church person from
[15:03] that moment on well in school they had
[15:08] what they call Christian
[15:10] union and I wasn't a member okay and
[15:14] actually I didn't become a member okay
[15:16] but what I did when they had meetings I
[15:18] would go to attend but I wasn't a member
[15:21] m uh when they would have R I would go
[15:23] at 10 but it came to a
[15:27] time during that time
[15:29] the Christian union leaders decided to
[15:32] approach me to tell me to take
[15:35] the so I took over the Christian union I
[15:39] wasn't a member but they asked me come
[15:42] please we see what we are doing is not
[15:45] is not what we we have and you able to
[15:49] meet so they invited me and gave me to
[15:51] leave the chran MH and that's how I I
[15:56] entered the
[15:59] still the same year 1972 yeah
[16:04] that's 72 or early 73 okay and so you
[16:09] start now ministering at the uh
[16:12] Christian scripture Union at the school
[16:14] and you are leading it and ministering
[16:16] to these people how then did you what
[16:20] was your first encounter with the
[16:22] message of brother
[16:24] BR uh what happened is now that I'm a
[16:27] Christian
[16:29] and now I have a desire to share with
[16:32] people what I what I've
[16:34] experienced the Christian union used to
[16:36] have what they called Sunday school
[16:37] teaching in other churches around the
[16:40] school so I decided to go to one of the
[16:44] Sunday schools to teach the young
[16:47] children but where I
[16:49] went I didn't teach the children the
[16:52] mothers and the fathers who are in the
[16:54] church said you are going to
[16:56] preach so for the first time I people
[16:59] outside when I did preach which church
[17:02] is this that was the fr the French
[17:04] Church H okay yeah I I noticed there
[17:07] quite plenty in
[17:09] Kenya of Kenya yes and from
[17:12] there I was invited several other small
[17:15] fellowships around the school so I kept
[17:18] on going around from this small
[17:20] Fellowship to this Fellowship this
[17:22] church this church and I made friends
[17:26] people knew me around the school now so
[17:29] in
[17:30] 1973 a sister tells me who was just from
[17:33] around the school tells me I have read a
[17:36] book and in that book God spoke to a man
[17:39] from a tree I said where is that
[17:43] book this is a friend from the quers
[17:46] yeah okay the sister from the quers yes
[17:48] yes she tells me she was a saved
[17:50] Christian from the quer church okay okay
[17:52] so she tells me I've read a book and in
[17:54] that book God spoke to a man for
[17:59] and this man is
[18:00] amazing so I say where where is that
[18:03] book say I'll give you so what I do I go
[18:07] to the sister's home over the weekend
[18:10] and I picked the book and the book I
[18:12] picked was a man sent from
[18:14] home when I saw the book I read the book
[18:18] I wept over the story about brother Bram
[18:22] and I thought brother was still alive so
[18:25] I wrote him a letter okay and asked him
[18:29] to send me
[18:30] books so what happened was books were
[18:33] sent to the school ctoons and c and
[18:36] books so many MH that every student was
[18:40] given three and the remaining were put
[18:42] in the library mhm now from
[18:46] there they also sent me the
[18:49] Sals a prophet uh 20 Cur
[18:53] prophet and the the booklet Lan church
[18:58] thank so I deled into reading the
[19:00] books and finding what was there okay
[19:04] well up to this
[19:06] time I thought brother Bram was a
[19:09] wonderful preacher I didn't know he was
[19:10] a
[19:11] prophet but I would get what was was
[19:13] reading the books and preached to the
[19:16] brothers in the school mhm we had
[19:18] Services every day after supper mhm so
[19:21] every day after supper I read from those
[19:24] books I did something I go to the
[19:27] fellowship and and preach with the
[19:29] brothers teach the
[19:30] brothers I did know it was a message for
[19:33] me it was just very wonderful preaching
[19:36] so you would read and enjoy it and then
[19:38] you preach to your share with other
[19:40] students what I've read tell them about
[19:43] the godhead how God is one them about
[19:47] baptism we went on like that and you
[19:50] know it is very amazing because I
[19:52] noticed there many Pentecostal preachers
[19:54] that have read the message of brother
[19:56] bham and they all they stopped there
[19:58] they did they did not have the grace to
[20:00] continue on with the further part of the
[20:03] message to understand it deeply and so
[20:05] here is where you had arrived you just
[20:08] you do not have the whole message but
[20:09] fractions of the message and whatever
[20:12] you read it was food to to your soul
[20:15] that's right and so we are now in 1963
[20:18] still 773 oh sorry
[20:21] 19773 and so uh you already even
[20:25] preaching about baptism were you
[20:26] baptized yourself no I wasn't bapti mhm
[20:30] and by that time yeah and I was asking
[20:32] now Christians are being baptized in
[20:34] water what happens yes but I will
[20:37] continue to preach what I was reading
[20:39] the message
[20:41] but with some of the older Pentecostal I
[20:45] knew and one of them told me that man Le
[20:50] and therefore keep away from those books
[20:51] so already by that time there were
[20:53] people passing the news the wrong news
[20:56] that brother bham is a back preacher
[20:58] yeah
[20:59] so what I did I took my books and placed
[21:02] them somewhere and left them for some
[21:05] time but something happened I visited
[21:09] another sister and you know Pentecostals
[21:12] were having these materials and we
[21:14] didn't know they were even having tips
[21:18] country my mind so one of the pical
[21:20] sisters was having cassette player with
[21:23] the T of brother brandham okay so she
[21:25] gave me this T and told me take to
[21:27] brother so and so and don't listen to
[21:29] it so on the way I decided why did she
[21:33] tell me not to listen to it so I sat
[21:35] under the tree and put it on and who do
[21:39] I hear that good Preacher Brother
[21:42] Bram and as he preached I was not
[21:45] hearing everything but the anointing was
[21:48] overwhelming yes and I said this man is
[21:50] a prophet my my so I so you were reading
[21:53] his messages in books but this is the
[21:55] first time you will hear his voice yes
[21:58] so I go back to where I put my books I
[22:02] begin reading them again I now go to the
[22:04] brothers I
[22:05] was to I tell this man is a
[22:08] prophet because the anointing I fail I
[22:12] could all the English words was speaking
[22:16] but something in my heart would as if
[22:19] you know I was grabbing something from
[22:22] somewhere so I knew this man is a
[22:24] prophet and from there I decided to
[22:26] stand the message amen and uh
[22:31] so you you it's quite amazing the way
[22:34] you you you were given a cassette take
[22:36] it somewhere and then you end up you
[22:39] know listening to this message and you
[22:42] you were something moved on your heart
[22:44] that confirmed that this was of the Lord
[22:46] yeah and no wonder by the B preached the
[22:49] message the Deep cth to the Deep you
[22:51] right there must have been a deep
[22:53] calling in your heart and then there was
[22:55] a deep respond to that that's right and
[22:57] so when then did you CU did you know of
[23:01] any other believers of this message in
[23:04] in this part of the world not that time
[23:07] M I continued preaching but I was
[23:10] reading from the books not knowing there
[23:13] were other believers in the country okay
[23:16] then
[23:17] towards the end of 73 yes I got wi that
[23:21] there was a brother in a college near
[23:24] our place okay who knew the message so
[23:28] so somehow we connected around 74 okay
[23:34] and by that time we had finished college
[23:35] and gone back to Nairobi mhm we began to
[23:40] communicate uh I continued preaching and
[23:43] people were believing the message but
[23:45] nobody baptized them I was not baptized
[23:49] okay so you have a bunch of people they
[23:51] Believers you believer but there's no
[23:53] one to baptize no one to baptize I'm not
[23:55] baptized myself you're not baptized and
[23:57] so how did you to then go go on from
[24:00] there so now what happens 74 73 you know
[24:03] we are mixing sometimes with the
[24:06] Pentecostals sometimes with the message
[24:07] believer there was not really great good
[24:10] boundary yes so I finish my
[24:14] school and I decide I'm not going for
[24:18] form five MH because um I felt such a um
[24:24] an arge in my heart that I needed to
[24:26] stay around the West in place mhm and
[24:30] preach the message I don't know what was
[24:31] happening with me but that was a big
[24:34] pull in my heart mhm and my friends were
[24:37] all talking about going to form five and
[24:38] going to University I failed even if I
[24:42] passed well and of course I did I got my
[24:44] first division but I decided I would
[24:47] stay and P the message MH
[24:50] so come
[24:53] 75 uh now I'm not in
[24:56] school I went for time preaching about
[24:59] the message M then it came to around
[25:03] Easter M I decided we have to make a
[25:06] decision about the message so I went to
[25:10] the the college where this brother was
[25:12] because I I think he had told me there's
[25:14] a brother there who was baptized I went
[25:16] there MH asked him to baptize me he did
[25:19] baptize me early 75 mhm so I go back and
[25:25] Easter is coming I plan for a meeting
[25:28] and invite all the people are preach to
[25:30] the message MH tell them we have a
[25:33] meeting certain point all of you I'm
[25:36] inviting you to come
[25:38] mhm uh that week before
[25:42] Friday I take a few of message books I
[25:45] have and the Bible yes and I went to a
[25:49] brother's house there's a brother was a
[25:50] teacher Pentecostal brother mhm and
[25:54] because schools were closed his house
[25:57] would would be empty
[25:58] so I requested him to give me the house
[26:00] for that week MH so I go to that house I
[26:04] look myself there with my message books
[26:07] with my Bible and I did studying of the
[26:10] message I read the message to find I
[26:12] told God if these things are true just
[26:15] open them to me because I want to make a
[26:18] decision to act on it m so I read about
[26:21] the godhead I read about uh most of the
[26:24] doctrines I study the message I study
[26:27] the Bible MH then
[26:29] Friday um I
[26:32] decide uh those who come for the meeting
[26:34] during the Easter Friday I'll preach to
[26:38] them those who believe I'll baptize them
[26:41] yes so I borrow clothes
[26:44] from ladies I knew around I put in a
[26:48] suitcase some clothes from men I knew
[26:51] around I put in the suitcase I car the
[26:53] suitcase the church and I put it under
[26:56] the table
[26:58] then I preach I
[27:01] preach I ask are there any people here
[27:05] who want to be
[27:06] bapti and so many hands go up I say no
[27:09] listen I'm not talking about any other
[27:12] time I'm talking about now you want be
[27:14] baptized now they close here under the
[27:16] table you change and you be
[27:19] baptized and that day I baptized 11
[27:22] people praise the Lord that was
[27:24] wonderful so immediately I baptized the
[27:27] people such a fear grip to me because it
[27:31] is not known in my area for such a young
[27:34] man to baptize people and he's not even
[27:37] an ordained preacher in any church is
[27:40] known or church so fear grips me and I I
[27:45] I hurriedly left that place going back
[27:49] home but the news went all over and then
[27:53] from there because everybody heard about
[27:56] the those who were baptized every
[27:58] weeked I would have people come to my my
[28:01] home and I would take them to the river
[28:04] baptize them sometimes I'd go the river
[28:06] several times in a day somebody comes I
[28:10] go to the river baptize them what
[28:13] happened after that is that people began
[28:14] to gather the river when they would see
[28:16] me go down just come people would run
[28:19] from all the from the other side and
[28:21] from the other side and gather the river
[28:23] so I would pre to them there then
[28:25] baptize the one I brought mhm and that
[28:28] went on some time so you became John
[28:30] John the Baptist of sorts
[28:34] then you know uh what has really moved
[28:37] me is uh the decision you made because I
[28:41] noticed this you know reminds me of the
[28:44] decisions I also made when I I I first
[28:46] heard this message comes to show that
[28:49] when someone hears the message the very
[28:52] first thing that will come to them when
[28:54] the message becomes a reality they will
[28:56] be first
[28:58] with a a decision to make yeah they have
[29:01] to make a decision whether to stand for
[29:04] this message because if they convinced
[29:05] they have to be concerned about sending
[29:07] out the message and so you decided to
[29:10] let go of your educational ambition at
[29:14] the time and you did not go to form five
[29:16] cuz it was not in the in that area you
[29:19] had to travel to Nairobi or some other
[29:21] place no I was to just within the area
[29:23] maybe bong side okay I would go for form
[29:26] five but you fail that you had to stay
[29:28] there I felt I must stay around my place
[29:31] yes because I felt the Brethren needed
[29:34] me yes yeah so for the sake of this
[29:37] message yeah and uh I wonder I wonder
[29:41] all of you who are listening to us today
[29:43] how
[29:44] many have made such a decision whereby
[29:48] you decide to sacrifice everything else
[29:52] it even seems as if you would sacrifice
[29:54] your life for the for the sake of the of
[29:56] the true faith of the Apostles what you
[29:59] have received because brother bham
[30:01] preached a message convinced and then
[30:02] concerned yeah I these days some young
[30:06] men can believe the message and even
[30:08] coming to church is a tag of War they
[30:10] feel the church is far and and and you
[30:12] know they cannot be able to walk to
[30:13] church if it's the little sacrifice they
[30:15] can make so and and so now you are
[30:18] baptized and then you baptized this this
[30:20] group of people and you
[30:22] now still you've not yet started a
[30:24] church that is the beginning of my
[30:26] church that's not the beginning of the
[30:28] church yeah from there now Services
[30:30] began to be in that place where it was a
[30:33] home of a sister we began Services there
[30:36] so we are now talking about
[30:38] 1975 yeah 1975 and amazing that is 50
[30:43] years ago yeah and Al also the
[30:46] repercussion from the decision not to go
[30:48] to form five was so big especially you
[30:52] know those days people going to form
[30:55] five or something
[30:56] great and so my parents and everybody
[30:59] thought I was mad in fact they were
[31:00] saying I was mad at one time I was
[31:03] approach and told you know you are not
[31:05] normal so you have to be
[31:08] helped and Son of I almost
[31:12] believed they convinced you were
[31:16] crazy because of the of the of the
[31:19] decision you had made yeah and also the
[31:21] behavior and the uniqueness of the whole
[31:23] thing nobody have never known of
[31:25] somebody who comes from nowhere and Bing
[31:28] people and he's not compromising with
[31:31] the Unown religions yes and the
[31:33] Pentecostals are scared of him yes so it
[31:36] was it bring a lot of rpps around you
[31:39] see uh pastor vti this reminds me of um
[31:44] a scenario we had in
[31:46] Western I think South Southwest or
[31:48] western part of Kenya of Ethiopia we had
[31:51] a mission there with a a brother called
[31:54] brother beab and this is in his uh area
[31:59] where of course there were no message
[32:02] churches there I think until now we
[32:04] don't have a message church but we have
[32:05] a couple Believers there now yes but um
[32:09] most of them are Lutheran and others but
[32:11] you see they have a principle that if
[32:14] you die if a person dies you are
[32:17] buried uh at at the church if you're a
[32:19] Muslim they bury you at the mosque if
[32:21] you a Catholic they have their barrial
[32:23] grounds a Lutheran they have their
[32:25] barrial grounds and so if you leave your
[32:28] church for any new or unknown Faith they
[32:31] just excommunicate you and if you die
[32:35] they don't bury you they leave your body
[32:37] there for the birds of the air so it is
[32:40] kind of known that you are an outcast
[32:43] and that entire family is marked for
[32:45] Generations so when when I remember when
[32:48] I I hear your testimony it reminds me of
[32:50] that that you you accepted to to be an
[32:54] outcast that's right for the sake of the
[32:56] truth for the sake of the this message I
[32:59] don't know maybe I'll go ahead of myself
[33:01] a little bit do you have any regrets for
[33:03] doing that decision now 50 years later
[33:06] in fact I would say there's nothing I
[33:09] regret about mhm and there's nothing I
[33:13] missed mhm because what God has done for
[33:17] me in life cannot
[33:20] compare maybe I would have gone to form
[33:22] five maybe going to University maybe
[33:24] been something but I look at my friends
[33:26] who did that m and they're not much
[33:28] better
[33:30] mhm actually if is financially God has
[33:33] helped me so much mhm I have nothing to
[33:36] regret M he has blessed me he has given
[33:39] me what actually maybe I wouldn't have
[33:42] had if I had going the other side mhm
[33:45] yeah I was actually amazed you know our
[33:48] viewers you may not know when I was
[33:51] invited to go to kosi it's a rural area
[33:53] a rural setting and so but when I
[33:56] arrived I was a amazed when I I saw the
[33:59] church building it looked like a church
[34:02] building in in the middle of a city and
[34:04] when I I went later on the pastor took
[34:06] me to one of his projects yeah he owns a
[34:09] school and I was so amazed when I saw it
[34:12] like a very huge school with the buses
[34:14] and cars and many students I said my my
[34:18] in a ruler setting sincerely I I would
[34:21] agree with you when you say you have
[34:22] nothing to regret of because when you
[34:25] believe this message like the Bible says
[34:27] that se ke the first the kingdom of God
[34:29] and all its righteousness then all the
[34:31] rest of these things shall be added sure
[34:33] so um we are so blessed to hear a
[34:36] witness um a testimony like yours that
[34:39] can encourage us our generation that if
[34:41] we stand for this message we have
[34:44] nothing to regret of many years from now
[34:47] and you see that all these friends of
[34:49] yours actually many of
[34:51] them you much even better than them sure
[34:56] um this brings me
[34:58] to to a question um speaking of the
[35:02] message to you and this is to the
[35:06] viewers what is the
[35:09] message
[35:11] um you see people think the message is
[35:14] the
[35:16] books uh some think the message is
[35:20] following brother
[35:21] brandham but to me the message is God
[35:24] being manifested in your life amen when
[35:28] the word of God becomes real to you real
[35:31] in your heart revealed to
[35:34] you and you get the concept of what God
[35:37] is saying in your
[35:39] day I think that's what the message is
[35:41] all
[35:42] about um I know people call the books
[35:46] the message which is okay M but you can
[35:50] have the books just like somebody can
[35:52] have another
[35:54] book and you can um memorize the books
[35:59] just like somebody memorize a literature
[36:01] book but there's a difference when God
[36:03] takes those words and plants in your
[36:06] heart MH and it makes them real you can
[36:10] die for them amen makes them so real in
[36:12] your life you know the problem we have
[36:16] today people say they're receiving the
[36:19] message but what is the message the
[36:22] message is a
[36:24] revelation what God revealed mhm through
[36:29] the prophet of our day amen you see when
[36:32] the message was given to John the
[36:34] Baptist it was in symbols mhm and God
[36:38] will come and bring it out but it was in
[36:40] the
[36:41] symbols so when you get what is was when
[36:44] it symbols and it's revealed to you and
[36:47] you can hold it and you can live on it
[36:50] becomes part of you to me that's what I
[36:52] call the message amen Christ in you
[36:56] Christ in you so uh it's more than just
[36:59] knowledge it's a life sure it is more
[37:02] than knowledge it is more than just a
[37:05] group and more than just changing
[37:08] positions mhm it is something that
[37:10] touches on your life mhm yeah no wonder
[37:14] the people I've been following the
[37:16] testimonies like yours of the oldtimers
[37:20] even those in the US and in some other
[37:22] countries that first the first
[37:24] generation of the people that receed
[37:25] this message you could see that there
[37:27] life was a very simple life but also a
[37:31] very sincere life and God and there were
[37:34] people full of love Yeah in the
[37:36] beginning when you were telling us your
[37:37] testimony you spoke of listening to a
[37:39] tape of Billy
[37:41] Graham in in in our time
[37:43] now you find that even pastors ministers
[37:48] are fighting against other pastors who
[37:50] both claim to believe the message but
[37:53] when I read the message of brother
[37:54] banham he was so full of love that even
[37:57] when he talked about Oro Roberts or
[37:59] Billy Graham or any of these ministers
[38:01] he he would speak about them with with
[38:04] love and you could see that he truly
[38:05] loved them and and and so I don't know
[38:08] whether you see that there's something
[38:10] that we our generation has missed
[38:13] actually I'm so ashamed of what we are
[38:17] today uh where we have drawn circles all
[38:21] over and we try our best to be the only
[38:25] ones I think that should not be the case
[38:29] and I think brother ra didn't do that
[38:30] didn't teach us that that's right so we
[38:33] have a message that's not
[38:35] message where people are build build
[38:37] building personality camps mhm and
[38:40] personality Empire Empires mhm I think
[38:44] that's wrong M I believe that we may
[38:48] differ in principle yeah but you still
[38:51] my brother yes uh your approach to
[38:55] things may not be my Approach yes
[38:58] but I still should look at you as a
[39:00] brother M and of late recently that has
[39:03] been my my biggest preaching in the
[39:06] church mhm I've been calling my church
[39:08] not to draw any Circle yes and not to
[39:11] look at anybody as as not a good person
[39:14] mhm because they not in your Camp
[39:17] because he's not in my
[39:19] camp in any case these camps are not
[39:21] even it's just like denominations yes
[39:24] yeah exactly yeah so I feel
[39:27] a time if comes to some the minister to
[39:31] realize that the camps have no place in
[39:35] God MH that we are Breen we are sons of
[39:39] God we are Daughters of
[39:41] God and brother says if somebody says
[39:45] bad about you say good about him mhm if
[39:48] somebody does not love you love him amen
[39:51] and that's how we can conquer and you
[39:53] know brother brother Billy Paul the L
[39:55] was asked about the great miracle that
[39:58] brother banam performed he said the
[40:01] greatest miracle that he saw was he
[40:04] never saw he could not tell the
[40:06] difference between the enemy and a
[40:09] friend of brother banham you're right
[40:11] that he loved everybody and genuinely
[40:14] all right so when the life of Jesus
[40:16] Christ comes in an individual uh they
[40:19] they will have true love and even for
[40:21] the Cena to be able to reach out to them
[40:23] and and tell them the truth and so I
[40:26] understand that you organ organized the
[40:28] first Believers convention in Kenya and
[40:31] I've heard this from many other
[40:33] testimonies of other people that I've
[40:34] met in Kenya can you please tell us
[40:36] about that yes what happened was 1975 I
[40:41] was just a college
[40:42] student and um we didn't have many
[40:46] Believers MH uh we were about my wife
[40:50] another sister and a few others M very
[40:54] few those who are committed actually
[40:55] were just about three of us
[40:58] M
[41:00] and while in college I was invited to go
[41:02] and preach at our school capit high
[41:05] school mhm for one of my brothers we
[41:09] were within school had been taken there
[41:11] form five okay so he talk to the CEO
[41:14] chairman and the officials that I have a
[41:17] brother he can come and preach to us so
[41:20] I went there we had meetings over the
[41:23] weekend mhm and uh after the me the
[41:26] meeting
[41:28] several people believed quite a number
[41:30] of them
[41:30] believed and when they
[41:33] believed uh I baptized
[41:36] them and those who
[41:39] believed if you have heard of brother
[41:42] Mayo yeah he a a senior pastor in
[41:45] Nairobi one of
[41:46] the the churches in Nairobi he was the
[41:49] chairman mhm so he tells
[41:54] me uh we discuss with him is it a POS
[41:57] posibility to have a meeting here he
[41:59] tells me yes let me ask the the
[42:01] principal so he goes to the principal
[42:03] the principal gives him an okay mhm so
[42:06] he tells me you can now organize the
[42:08] meeting mhm so I go looking for food to
[42:12] feed the people and announcing the
[42:14] meeting but remember we don't have much
[42:16] money we are just students we have given
[42:18] 20 Shillings every month this the money
[42:21] we are going to put into the convention
[42:24] mhm so we take this money we buy food
[42:28] steps every month we buy food
[42:31] steps then I realized I don't have
[42:34] enough
[42:35] money by this
[42:38] time um I had we had connected somehow
[42:45] with brother Frank Frank award Frank
[42:47] award yes and Frank was coming to Kenya
[42:51] okay so I went to Nairobi to meet him
[42:55] okay when I went to Nairobi to meet him
[42:59] I found also there were other brothers
[43:01] okay I found brother guu brother
[43:05] Sila and I think other several Brothers
[43:09] I can't remember well yes so we meet
[43:12] brother Frank we talk to brother Frank I
[43:14] tell him what I wanted we thought he
[43:16] would give us a public address system he
[43:19] says I'm going to buy you right now you
[43:21] wait we go back to the to to the shops
[43:25] but it is evening of Saturday and I have
[43:26] to go go back to college okay so I tell
[43:28] him I can't wait because I'm a student
[43:31] and I took my off over the weekend I
[43:34] just have to go back to college MH so
[43:36] he's very disappointed and I go back to
[43:40] college so while I'm at college now this
[43:43] time for the camp the end of the year
[43:45] this is December mhm we are going to the
[43:47] December it's about October November and
[43:51] now I realize I don't have money enough
[43:53] money
[43:55] to to to you know to sponsor sponsor the
[43:59] meetings the
[44:00] meetings a friend of mine a Pentecostal
[44:03] comes and tells me my meeting is being
[44:05] sponsored I've good sponsors and I feel
[44:08] helpless because I not sponsor by
[44:11] meetings so what I did I was remaining
[44:14] with 20 Shing 20 shs then was a lot of
[44:17] money I went looked to myself in a room
[44:20] and opened that 20s before the Lord and
[44:23] I told him Lord you know my efforts and
[44:26] now this is all the money I have just
[44:28] tell me mhm so after I prayed not
[44:33] thinking about it I got to the post
[44:34] office I had a post office box I open it
[44:38] I get a good envelope out of it and when
[44:41] I open I receive a big check of 1,000
[44:45] Shillings those days 1,000 Shillings was
[44:47] a lot of
[44:48] money and the letter the letter written
[44:51] by this brother says this money put
[44:54] where it is urgently need M I knew God
[44:59] had answered my
[45:00] prayers so I took the money and sank it
[45:03] in the convention into the man was
[45:06] enough to feed the convention and we
[45:08] remain with
[45:09] abundance and this meeting I didn't know
[45:13] who to invite so I contacted this
[45:15] brother in Nairobi was was called Guru
[45:20] gur yes I tell him might you be knowing
[45:24] any message preachers he tells me oh
[45:26] yeah I know some just let me call them
[45:30] don't bother about preachers yes so he
[45:33] calls brother Sila brother moo brother
[45:36] guondo and himself and they come for the
[45:38] convention yes and actually although we
[45:43] have we were having a
[45:45] church there were so many things we
[45:47] didn't know what to do like in my church
[45:50] for example a sister was leading the
[45:52] services and sisters were not limited to
[45:54] doing certain things
[45:57] I know of other churches where the
[45:59] preachers didn't know what they were
[46:00] doing even some like in Brother G his
[46:04] church he told me during L supper he was
[46:07] watching all the sisters and all the
[46:08] brothers their feet so when we came to
[46:12] this this this church this this
[46:14] convention this would be a very big
[46:17] Turning Point most of us yes because we
[46:20] now learn from one another mhm the the
[46:23] true cont context of the message MH some
[46:27] of the things we are doing wrong some
[46:29] for example some sisters thought by
[46:30] having their their dresses just at the
[46:33] knee it was long enough and they
[46:35] discover no it is not so they go get
[46:39] pieces of clothes to sew around their
[46:42] their addresses to make the address long
[46:45] and you would you would think that was
[46:47] our uniform then because you see
[46:49] somebody has a black address and has put
[46:51] a yellow piece of
[46:53] dress at the bottom and and and and
[46:56] these days the the the dresses are going
[46:59] are going back again above the knees
[47:00] that's funny because when we had the
[47:03] message our dresses were lengthened mhm
[47:13] yeah I think we have a problem with the
[47:16] with the sound with the battery for this
[47:18] one
[47:27] [Music]
[47:29] yeah so uh I was just saying that the
[47:32] these days it looks like uh the dresses
[47:35] of the sisters are going back again
[47:37] above the knee but yet then God like
[47:41] gave you the the understanding the
[47:42] Revelation that that that was not right
[47:46] yeah especially that
[47:49] convention uh sisters realiz maybe if
[47:51] you want to use this microphone sorry uh
[47:54] sisters realized that uh what they
[47:56] thought was was long dresses or not long
[47:58] dresses and therefore they got other
[48:01] pieces of clothes and had them soon
[48:04] around their dresses to make them long H
[48:08] and not only that some brothers had very
[48:10] long hair okay and they went to
[48:14] shave there were certain dressing in
[48:17] those days the B bottom and the the the
[48:20] platform shoes the Fashions of the time
[48:23] yeah the Fashions of the time those who
[48:25] had platform shoes they were ashamed the
[48:28] meetings went to look for people to go
[48:31] and cut the
[48:32] shoe to be
[48:34] flat I know people did that in the meet
[48:37] in the meetings I know people who went
[48:40] from the meeting they rent the pap to go
[48:42] and shave their hair some of them were
[48:44] having very big hair MH and actually the
[48:47] atmosphere in that meeting at capset was
[48:51] such an atmosphere such an anointing M
[48:54] the presence of God was so much mhm M
[48:57] and we left that meeting all of us
[48:59] changed amen and that's the meeting that
[49:01] transformed Us in Kenya amen yeah and
[49:04] and that makes me wonder what inspired
[49:07] you to call a convention at that
[49:10] time well I wouldn't
[49:13] understand because I mean if if it was
[49:18] the ability I didn't have it mhm if it
[49:21] was the money we didn't have the
[49:23] money I was a student brother may was
[49:26] just as a student M and so I I didn't I
[49:29] don't see but I believe God was in it
[49:32] and God was doing it yeah and so then
[49:35] also apart from all this uh Revelations
[49:38] that God brought and and you know helped
[49:40] the Believers also it was like a linking
[49:43] with many other ministers around the
[49:46] country all over the country so you got
[49:47] to know each other yeah actually for the
[49:50] first time we knew one another and we
[49:52] sat in that convention and talked and
[49:55] even because we didn't have know how to
[49:57] if somebody wanted to marry who who does
[50:00] the we had to go back to these people we
[50:03] are saying they they
[50:05] Fallen but this time we now decided we
[50:08] have to have our own get licensed mhm
[50:11] and conduct marriages so we asked
[50:13] brother
[50:14] Sila from ambassa to go and register the
[50:18] Attorney General so that he can conduct
[50:20] marriages I remember the first when I
[50:23] first believe the first one of the first
[50:24] messages I listened to was brother
[50:27] translation of Swahili messages of
[50:29] brother bam yes God bless his heart yes
[50:32] yeah and brother guandu also the
[50:34] ugandans uh uh know him well I think
[50:37] he's been here several several times
[50:39] yeah right so I think those are the
[50:40] names I can recognize in in the among
[50:43] the ministers that you were working with
[50:45] at the time yes and and so let's move on
[50:49] to the Uganda connection uh when was the
[50:51] first time that you came to Uganda and
[50:53] how was the message in Uganda at the
[50:55] time so we are looking at um you've
[50:58] started your church
[51:00] 1975 and uh this when did this meeting
[51:04] hold this 75 December 75 December yeah
[51:08] so then when was the first time that you
[51:11] came to Uganda now to come to Uganda we
[51:14] had been going on in Kenya and there was
[51:17] a brother who got a B in had to
[51:20] translate the messages to kiss okay so
[51:24] we got together several ministers uh
[51:26] within our
[51:28] area you you know brother Barnabas of
[51:31] the voice of God he was yeah we got
[51:33] together with Barnabas and brother
[51:35] muhanji and the others and we decided we
[51:38] shall be behind his brother and support
[51:40] the work he was doing m in translating
[51:43] the message books so he did quite a
[51:45] number of books and uh the what he was
[51:48] doing was not quality but at that time
[51:51] that was something and we he would
[51:55] translate the church ages
[51:57] I went and printed it in in K and we had
[52:01] a few
[52:02] copies and in the
[52:04] process we got connected to brother way
[52:08] MH brother way remember the one who died
[52:11] in the meeting of brother bam yes um I
[52:14] think there's a message where brother
[52:15] bam talks about him and he
[52:18] says is he okay is he okay and yeah yeah
[52:21] yeah so brother way writes a letter to
[52:25] tell us about brother in Uganda who are
[52:27] in in
[52:28] trouble and even one of them has written
[52:31] to to him asking him to sponsor maybe a
[52:35] poultry farm or a mat to business M to
[52:39] help the Brethren MH so brother way says
[52:44] I don't know who can go to Uganda to
[52:46] find out what is going on there MH and
[52:49] that was not a good time to come to ug
[52:51] that was 1981 mhm when the theot over
[52:56] turning second time mhm and the militia
[52:59] Ugandan milti tan militia had come in
[53:02] mhm and they were driven all the forces
[53:05] of obot up the Border mhm so I come in
[53:08] around that time and the country is
[53:10] tense I ask a brother called mutoni mut
[53:14] is a pastor now in
[53:17] Botella I asked him whether you can go
[53:19] together with you he agreed he was from
[53:22] the West that time so he accompass me we
[53:25] come to Toro
[53:27] we don't know where we are going mhm we
[53:30] just come we know that there is a a t g
[53:34] and there are some brothers there we
[53:37] have a name of that brother who wrote
[53:38] the letter so we come to the t g and
[53:42] then request to see this brother so we
[53:45] go to this brother's
[53:47] house and we talk with him we sit with
[53:50] him the situation was wasn't very good
[53:52] in this country mhm because even as we
[53:55] arrived in we F in the hands of this
[53:58] militia yeah and then they took us in
[54:02] where they were seated and the our guns
[54:04] are pointing at us and they trying to be
[54:07] friended to us we are so scared but
[54:10] after being with them for some time
[54:12] because we can't now hurry we can't tell
[54:14] them we want to go we just relaxed and
[54:17] trying to show them we are not afraid
[54:19] but after sometime they now ask us you
[54:23] can now go so they for somebody who has
[54:26] a there take these people there the
[54:28] other side so we are taking to we find
[54:31] these
[54:32] brothers and we talk with them we now
[54:36] get connection we get the picture of the
[54:38] what is going in the country there's a
[54:40] problem with the food there's a problem
[54:42] with supplies even clothing is a problem
[54:46] so we left with the report and um when
[54:50] we reach at the
[54:52] border this brother one of the brothers
[54:54] gave me an old cassette to to repair for
[54:57] him when we reach the Border we arrested
[55:00] without cassette and we are put
[55:02] in what was wrong with the cassette
[55:05] these people didn't seem to know what a
[55:07] cassette was H and they think we have a
[55:10] gadget that is dangerous ah some of
[55:13] those cassetes were not just normal
[55:15] cassetes yeah some of them were a bit
[55:18] complicated so they ask us what is this
[55:22] we tell this a cassette player Poli
[55:25] cassettes and we are Christians they say
[55:27] no You Are
[55:28] Spice so they lock Us in we plead and
[55:32] plead and plead and they bed for hours
[55:35] they even threaten to shoot us there H
[55:38] so after a long time somehow I spoke
[55:41] something and one say one of them said
[55:44] you have spoken good but these others
[55:46] are not speaking nicely so there was a a
[55:49] lady there was also a soldier she looked
[55:52] friendly now and said let let them just
[55:55] go let them just go so we were left to
[55:57] go and that marked the connection with
[55:59] Uganda from there and now WR Brothers uh
[56:04] way brother way I
[56:08] think uh talked to a brother in in
[56:12] Britain okay it was called brother stone
[56:14] m and they made some
[56:17] contributions and and U that same year
[56:20] toward the end of that same year that
[56:22] brother comes in with some some finances
[56:27] M so we buy clothing in Kenya and we
[56:30] come some money here so we came with the
[56:33] money and some clothing we gave clothing
[56:36] in Toro we went
[56:39] to uh that brother in Bali MH they
[56:42] forget his
[56:44] name there was this brother in Bal he's
[56:47] still
[56:48] there
[56:52] then is in ginger not there's another
[56:55] brother also
[56:56] Myra no that is more recent one H okay
[57:01] then we go to up to
[57:04] sorot brother's place M but to go to
[57:09] sorot it was
[57:12] challenging because you know that time
[57:15] these people are all over and they have
[57:16] roadblocks and if you are Kenyan they
[57:19] see you in form of
[57:21] money so we
[57:24] decide uh as we go to
[57:27] to uh to
[57:29] sorot we go to sorot I think we left
[57:32] brother Stone in
[57:34] tooro because we thought him being a
[57:37] white we would easily be identified mhm
[57:41] so we come back and we come here and the
[57:43] journey to this campal this road was so
[57:47] rough we went to Brother o Kell's house
[57:49] I've never met brother K but I went to
[57:52] that his house that time he wasn't in
[57:54] okay I think he had gone out of the
[57:56] country yes and went to his house and
[57:59] whever we went we bought some M we
[58:01] bought some food stuffs and de the bre
[58:03] with and we went back to to Uganda to
[58:07] Kenya mhm then these brothers were
[58:10] connected in too some of them crossed
[58:12] over to Kenya we found them jobs there
[58:16] mhm so from there now we began coming to
[58:20] Uganda for example now I began coming to
[58:23] Tor to PR there mhm and then in our
[58:26] coming many times I don't know which it
[58:29] was we now encountered a young man
[58:31] called odipo mhm has a young man in that
[58:35] Fellowship there was somebody there also
[58:38] and we saw brother him to have something
[58:41] we really encourage him to preach mhm
[58:43] and I met friends brother oio he would
[58:46] come to our meetings and most of these
[58:49] brothers came to our meetings brother I
[58:51] and the rest of them would cross over to
[58:53] our meetings okay and we had such a such
[58:57] a connection so Uganda and Kenya has
[58:59] been connected for a long time yeah and
[59:02] maybe for some who don't understand at
[59:04] that time I
[59:06] um I was just reading a little bit of
[59:10] what B bam was saying here in 1964 the
[59:12] message aible he said and now we are
[59:14] supposed to be going overseas over to
[59:17] Kenya and tanganika and Uganda in the
[59:20] tribes in there and they are having a
[59:23] little uprise now with the ma I can't
[59:26] get in as a missionary but I'm going to
[59:28] try to get in as a hunter go in and and
[59:32] and they're fixing up so um I don't you
[59:37] were you were we were you and I was
[59:39] discussing about this I do not know was
[59:41] this the year of the Mau Rebellion 1964
[59:44] the ma Mau Rebellion was in the 50s was
[59:48] it was in the 50s yeah and around 1963
[59:53] December M Kenya got independence okay
[59:56] so 64 Kenya was independent and the my M
[1:00:01] apprising was not much air mhm because
[1:00:07] uh actually we were we were independent
[1:00:11] and there wasn't much of that so by you
[1:00:13] see people I think people were reviewing
[1:00:15] what had been there yes yeah and so the
[1:00:19] the information even I'm sure did not
[1:00:21] use to travel as fast yeah at that time
[1:00:24] as it do today as it is today but even
[1:00:27] today we have a lot of fake news going
[1:00:28] around even then I believe even then
[1:00:31] what was being talked by the Europeans
[1:00:33] across MH was not the real picture so I
[1:00:38] think this gives me a mindset that even
[1:00:41] today you have a lot of missionary
[1:00:44] brothers or ministers fearing to come to
[1:00:47] Africa because of what they see on the
[1:00:50] news yeah and not only that even some
[1:00:54] ministers here in Africa they paint a
[1:00:58] very bad picture of us here in Africa to
[1:01:00] be able to win those Brothers abroad to
[1:01:04] give Aid mhm so somebody paints a very
[1:01:06] miserable picture we are starving we are
[1:01:09] starving the other time someone was
[1:01:11] saying oh we are eating dogs yeah and
[1:01:14] therefore you know when the brothers
[1:01:16] abroad hear that that's the picture they
[1:01:18] have which true yeah and one of the
[1:01:22] things that I I have learned is to trust
[1:01:25] God yes not to not to present the
[1:01:28] miserable picture of a Dying Africa
[1:01:31] Church yes and try to you know to play
[1:01:36] on the sympathy of the brothers abroad
[1:01:39] mhm because I don't think that's what
[1:01:42] God wants us to do so wrong information
[1:01:45] can hinder the flaw and extension of the
[1:01:50] Gospel that's right and you may think
[1:01:53] you are spreading the gospel with that
[1:01:55] sort of wrong wrong wrong information
[1:01:58] and God is not with you MH because when
[1:02:00] you use lies to cheat those Brothers
[1:02:03] actually you are robbing them mhm
[1:02:05] because those brothers are also
[1:02:07] straining yes so when you cheat them to
[1:02:09] Rob them for your own benefit and you
[1:02:12] think you are doing a service to God I
[1:02:14] think God is not with you and I think
[1:02:16] we'll talk a little more about that um
[1:02:18] but I I want to emphasize on this thing
[1:02:22] of wrong information because do you know
[1:02:25] who brother bam was talking to at the
[1:02:28] time in 196 in the 1960s who was his
[1:02:31] correspondent with the with East Africa
[1:02:34] there was a brother called Joseph Bose
[1:02:36] okay and Joseph Bose was in Mombasa okay
[1:02:39] yeah and he talked about even the
[1:02:41] message in those days there yes there
[1:02:43] there some people mson is mson b mson b
[1:02:47] yes mson B yes yeah so he was in Kenya
[1:02:50] and he was mostly in Mombasa area okay
[1:02:53] yeah um was he working for Kenya raes no
[1:02:59] the person who worked for Kenya raes was
[1:03:01] brother way oh that was brother way the
[1:03:04] one who was in the meetings of brother B
[1:03:06] brother way the one you were
[1:03:07] corresponding with yeah and he spoke
[1:03:09] good K okay very fluent okay yeah and so
[1:03:15] um these brothers do you think they
[1:03:17] might have misinformed brother bam about
[1:03:19] the situation in Africa in East Africa
[1:03:23] specifically at the time I wouldn't know
[1:03:25] exact
[1:03:26] because I wasn't mature enough to to
[1:03:28] know the current current current news
[1:03:32] that was on mhm but I think it wasn't as
[1:03:36] bad as it was in the 50s MH yeah because
[1:03:39] if he's speaking about the M rebellion
[1:03:41] in 1964 it had already happened it it
[1:03:44] was 52 53 around there mhm 51 52 53
[1:03:48] around there but anyway um it also shows
[1:03:50] us a picture of the instability the
[1:03:53] security instability at the time yeah
[1:03:56] um which is what just actually relate to
[1:03:59] us when you first came to Uganda uh with
[1:04:02] the militias and and all that how it was
[1:04:05] difficult to come even with just a
[1:04:06] cassette player thinking you're a spy so
[1:04:08] it must have been difficult to maneuver
[1:04:11] around with the message at that time it
[1:04:14] was hard it was not
[1:04:17] easy yeah the transport was not what is
[1:04:20] on now M to travel from one place to
[1:04:23] another place you would take so long
[1:04:26] even within Kenya M just to move from
[1:04:29] one place to another place I remember I
[1:04:31] would move from my place to towards the
[1:04:34] border to bungoma M to areas where
[1:04:37] churches were and to get there sometimes
[1:04:40] you would spend a whole day mhm yeah and
[1:04:43] it wasn't very easy secondly we were not
[1:04:46] having anything we were so poor most of
[1:04:48] us MH so it was not easy to do things
[1:04:52] but we did so you've given us your
[1:04:56] background um how you started and um how
[1:05:00] you got to meet other brothers how you
[1:05:01] started you know making these meetings
[1:05:05] but still you were in rural Kenya at the
[1:05:08] time yeah so this makes me
[1:05:13] wonder uh if we talk about Ministry you
[1:05:17] know was it easy for you at the time to
[1:05:20] sustain your
[1:05:22] ministry um especially the r part of Kya
[1:05:27] well um I would say God gave us Grace
[1:05:31] for that day for that time like he was
[1:05:34] invited to go and preach
[1:05:36] somewhere and I didn't have the
[1:05:39] finances I just
[1:05:41] walked or it just
[1:05:45] rain yeah I just I just walk to the
[1:05:48] place if it is a even it took hours to
[1:05:51] walk I would walk to that place and
[1:05:53] preach if I saw I was getting later I
[1:05:55] would run I remember I ran more than 20
[1:05:59] 20 20 kilm to go and preach to a girl
[1:06:02] school and how old were you at the time
[1:06:05] I was about 1920 around 19 or 20 okay
[1:06:09] yeah so I I can I would rightly I would
[1:06:12] be right if I say that you used your
[1:06:15] strength oh yes for the purpose of the
[1:06:17] message at the time yeah and God gave us
[1:06:19] the grace but then how did you
[1:06:22] manage the ministry
[1:06:26] without money because we have a lot of
[1:06:30] young people today who think they can't
[1:06:31] serve God because they have no
[1:06:34] money and I'll will also bring it to you
[1:06:38] and to your attention that we have a
[1:06:41] lot of young ministers and when I say
[1:06:43] young I don't mean really really young
[1:06:45] like 20 or or 30 some may even be well
[1:06:48] over their 40s who have made
[1:06:52] it I should say uh
[1:06:56] the order of the day to write
[1:06:59] letters
[1:07:00] abroad begging for help in order to run
[1:07:04] the ministry back at home and to them
[1:07:07] they cannot be able to run the ministry
[1:07:10] without the white brothers or brothers
[1:07:14] from Asia wherever it is supporting
[1:07:18] them uh how were you able to do it at
[1:07:21] the time did you do the same thing that
[1:07:23] these brothers are doing because because
[1:07:26] we your ministry has been prosperous
[1:07:28] over the
[1:07:29] years even now you are still in a rural
[1:07:31] part of Kenya but last time I was there
[1:07:34] you've you know you've built a very huge
[1:07:36] church and I don't know do you have
[1:07:39] bazus giving you money because you need
[1:07:41] to advise
[1:07:42] us well serving God is a
[1:07:46] sacrifice if you're not ready to
[1:07:48] sacrifice don't don't go in the ministry
[1:07:51] mhm
[1:07:53] because uh from the time I believed I
[1:07:57] told you I got a th000 sh from Frank mhm
[1:08:00] and I think that's the only money I've
[1:08:02] got from abroad did you ask him for it
[1:08:05] no I told you what happened mhm and I
[1:08:08] believe God was in it
[1:08:11] mhm
[1:08:12] although L later I didn't agree with the
[1:08:15] Frank's approach to things M but I
[1:08:17] believe God used him that much mhm and
[1:08:22] then um I have always
[1:08:26] believed there are things of the message
[1:08:28] we need like books steps and other
[1:08:30] things that we don't have locally yes
[1:08:33] maybe today we may have a few locally
[1:08:36] but I believe that's what we needed from
[1:08:39] the brothers
[1:08:40] mhm uh the financial
[1:08:43] aspect like
[1:08:46] me I I went I I trained as a teacher MH
[1:08:50] I went to to train as a primary school
[1:08:52] teacher mhm the reason why I did that I
[1:08:55] believed I have enough time to serve God
[1:08:59] teaching as a primary school teacher I
[1:09:01] would have three months in a year free
[1:09:04] and I can make my three conventions in a
[1:09:07] year so I got I got a
[1:09:11] salary I fed my my family with it
[1:09:14] with and sometimes use that money when
[1:09:17] it was necessary do something for God
[1:09:20] mhm so the idea of asking for money from
[1:09:25] from abroad has never been in my my
[1:09:29] thoughts mhm and I have failed that's
[1:09:31] not right mhm
[1:09:34] yeah so um I worked and
[1:09:40] preached I worked as a teacher for 30
[1:09:44] years I worked as a teacher for 30 years
[1:09:47] as well as I pastored the
[1:09:50] church uh past when I came down to kosi
[1:09:56] and I keep going back to this because
[1:09:58] there's something I want my people My
[1:10:01] Generation to understand yes I've you've
[1:10:04] had me come over to kosi several times
[1:10:07] yes and uh and I've also brought over a
[1:10:11] few Brothers over the years to come and
[1:10:14] see how God has worked among you and
[1:10:17] among your
[1:10:18] people
[1:10:20] um we we've noticed like I said I noted
[1:10:24] previously
[1:10:26] that by by God's grace you've been able
[1:10:29] to build a church yes and I saw the
[1:10:32] first church before you de demolished it
[1:10:35] and another First Church before the
[1:10:37] other one that you demolished so the
[1:10:40] other one was um I think um do they call
[1:10:42] it mud mud Beauty was was it built out
[1:10:45] of mud it was brick but brick poorly
[1:10:48] made uhuh like okay so that thata like
[1:10:52] can I say traditional one the very first
[1:10:54] one I think was sitting about 20 30
[1:10:57] people around 50 people around 50 people
[1:11:00] okay and then you left that on and then
[1:11:03] you build another one sizable building
[1:11:06] yes I think we're sitting about 300 in
[1:11:09] it and now you have it's unfortunate I
[1:11:12] would not prepare these uh pictures for
[1:11:14] the people but um now you have a new
[1:11:17] building uh which is I was given an
[1:11:21] opportunity to come and be there at the
[1:11:23] dedication and we had the service
[1:11:25] dedication service um this seats I don't
[1:11:28] know more than 500 around 600 around 600
[1:11:32] yes so and it's very beautiful I mean
[1:11:36] when you arrive there you think wait
[1:11:39] where am I I mean in am I in
[1:11:41] Nairobi oh oh you know actually how the
[1:11:45] question is how are you able to do that
[1:11:49] in a rural part of
[1:11:50] Kenya without white people powering
[1:11:54] money into your ministry because some
[1:11:57] people we have a group of young
[1:11:58] ministers who think that's the only way
[1:12:00] to
[1:12:02] go uh and you can't convince them
[1:12:04] otherwise so can you convince us that it
[1:12:06] is
[1:12:08] possible well it is possible because it
[1:12:10] has happened yes um as I've told you we
[1:12:16] never have asked for money from
[1:12:18] abroad and I believed I believe that's
[1:12:22] the way we have done things we it's not
[1:12:24] that we are rich m M but we sacrifice M
[1:12:27] the first church we build a small Church
[1:12:31] M we just
[1:12:33] donated pledges in the church we donate
[1:12:36] and build the church first we donated we
[1:12:38] pledged bu bought the plot M we pled
[1:12:43] build the small
[1:12:44] church then we we thought this church
[1:12:47] was small because we now are having our
[1:12:49] meetings there mhm so we build the
[1:12:52] bigger Church you saw the first bigger
[1:12:54] Church mhm and soon it was not enough
[1:12:57] yes and the Brethren felt why can't we
[1:13:00] extend this church actually the idea was
[1:13:04] we extend the other Church MH but when I
[1:13:06] put the case before the church the
[1:13:09] people refused they said we build
[1:13:11] another church yes and um the the plan
[1:13:15] they brought was too
[1:13:18] big I told them no so what we did with
[1:13:22] the elders we worked a plan that that
[1:13:25] was what is now would save on space and
[1:13:30] will sit more people and that's how he
[1:13:32] brought in the idea of the baron mhm but
[1:13:36] where is the
[1:13:37] money but all we did was we believed God
[1:13:41] and we started we didn't have money we
[1:13:43] didn't have an account for the church MH
[1:13:45] we got the little money we got if it's
[1:13:47] for cement we put in cement if it's for
[1:13:51] the the the the Brick the blocks we
[1:13:53] brought the blocks
[1:13:55] and we started building just like that
[1:13:58] and I had the report I think was it
[1:14:00] brother Moses who was in charge of the
[1:14:02] building committe Moses been Char of
[1:14:04] building ah man that young man did a
[1:14:06] spectacular work I mean I had report he
[1:14:08] spent all his time there for the mans
[1:14:11] that we are
[1:14:13] building I I I just felt that if and we
[1:14:17] didn't pay him by the way he wasn't even
[1:14:19] paid that is sacrifice That's What I
[1:14:21] Call
[1:14:22] sacrifice and by the way the all these
[1:14:25] people that the pastor is saying that
[1:14:27] they sacrific to do that work to build
[1:14:29] that work God has blessed them some of
[1:14:31] you who have been with us to kosi you've
[1:14:33] seen the people are living in a rural
[1:14:35] area but when you come to the meetings I
[1:14:38] mean the parking is full the parking is
[1:14:41] full these people are blessed
[1:14:42] financially they are blessed spiritually
[1:14:45] and I believe that that's the way to go
[1:14:47] even for Our Generation to sacrifice
[1:14:50] sacrifice these days when you you I mean
[1:14:53] in message churches I don't know where
[1:14:55] that it's only here in Uganda people
[1:14:56] don't want to hear the pastor talking
[1:14:58] about money talking about contributions
[1:15:01] talking about pledges when you do I mean
[1:15:03] like for instance here at um days of the
[1:15:06] voice Fellowship we have um we've had
[1:15:08] some pledges going over some time now
[1:15:11] yes and we're trying to collect funds to
[1:15:15] uh buy our church plot it's about 200
[1:15:18] million ugana Shillings and we we we've
[1:15:21] been collecting that over time and so it
[1:15:25] like was became a little bit difficult
[1:15:26] so what we decided to do you know it
[1:15:28] just came to me as an inspiration that I
[1:15:30] should have the church divided into
[1:15:32] several groups we have now seven groups
[1:15:34] and each group collects a certain amount
[1:15:37] of money and then we bring it all
[1:15:39] together and we announce it to the
[1:15:40] church every Sunday morning so um and it
[1:15:46] is working I believe it is working cuz
[1:15:48] we are progressing we are going at the
[1:15:50] right direction currently we have about
[1:15:51] 67 million out of the 200 million and
[1:15:54] our church is not that big as you can
[1:15:56] see yeah so but um recently I heard that
[1:16:00] there's a certain person who visited
[1:16:02] from another church and had the
[1:16:04] collections we were making and and and
[1:16:07] was like no this church is a very good
[1:16:09] church but it is money-minded
[1:16:12] well you can't run the church without
[1:16:14] money mhm
[1:16:17] and what I can say my people have
[1:16:21] sacrificed to bring the church to where
[1:16:23] it is it is a sacrif rice some people
[1:16:26] have sacrificed heavily I don't want to
[1:16:28] mention names M there are people when
[1:16:31] there's a project in the church they
[1:16:33] take it personal mhm they take it
[1:16:36] personal and do it personally mhm and
[1:16:39] they are my strength M my church is my
[1:16:42] strength MH those people support me so
[1:16:45] seriously mhm they stand with me on
[1:16:47] every
[1:16:49] project and they they make me feel very
[1:16:53] humble that reminds me of the testimony
[1:16:56] that brother bham gave about that um
[1:16:58] poor Widow who was giving her little
[1:17:01] nickos yes and he didn't want to take it
[1:17:03] yeah that's yeah because he felt that
[1:17:06] these people don't have you know they
[1:17:08] are poor people and until until you know
[1:17:11] brother was it this brother who
[1:17:14] corrected him yeah that is it it was a
[1:17:17] Deon uh yeah uh you know this brother
[1:17:20] God had blessed him and you know he s
[1:17:23] Bri or something like that yeah and so
[1:17:26] turn turns out that brother banam also
[1:17:28] teaches and he asserts it is how
[1:17:32] important it is for the people to
[1:17:33] support their Pastor to support their
[1:17:36] the the labors of the
[1:17:39] ministry uh because support is not going
[1:17:41] to come from outside the church well God
[1:17:44] can do that over maybe sometimes but it
[1:17:47] must come from the people to support
[1:17:49] their own work yeah just you know
[1:17:52] brother says who is a church member
[1:17:55] explains a church
[1:17:57] member and a church member is not just a
[1:18:01] person who comes to sing in the church
[1:18:02] and goes away come to say aen goes away
[1:18:05] no is a man or woman that comes to
[1:18:09] church he supports that church with his
[1:18:12] finances through tithing and offerings
[1:18:15] he supports that church with his
[1:18:17] presence and with his
[1:18:19] prayers so we cannot
[1:18:22] exclude and I believe I believe
[1:18:25] I believe even he said if you don't if
[1:18:27] you don't pay tithe in the church for
[1:18:29] example you have no right to vote in
[1:18:31] that church you're not a member of that
[1:18:34] church so the support of the church
[1:18:37] financially is very important and what
[1:18:40] I've done I've taught my people and they
[1:18:42] know it and they support the
[1:18:45] church I I only avoid extremes I don't
[1:18:49] want to put them extremes where they
[1:18:51] always you
[1:18:52] know on big projects every time time yes
[1:18:55] I I sort of regulate yes sometimes I I
[1:19:00] differ with them they they themselves
[1:19:02] want it I tell you no because I H they
[1:19:05] want to overburden them yeah overburden
[1:19:07] them yes just to do what they can and if
[1:19:10] one project I put on them we work on it
[1:19:13] yes and they have been wonderful yes
[1:19:15] they have supported me they actually the
[1:19:17] strength of my Ministry M yeah how I
[1:19:21] wish our generation can learn this not
[1:19:25] only those who are hearing me at this
[1:19:27] time but even those who will hear this
[1:19:29] over the next
[1:19:31] years um I just wish I had the pictures
[1:19:34] to show you on on
[1:19:36] what Pastor vas Minister has been able
[1:19:39] to accomplish with the people like he
[1:19:42] said supporting that work supporting
[1:19:44] locally I mean I had an opportunity of
[1:19:46] being with one of your sons in the Lord
[1:19:49] uh brother Timothy yes and uh I I I
[1:19:53] could see that I mean I I did not need
[1:19:55] to whatever project we had at the time
[1:19:57] in Ethiopia cuz um um we met him a
[1:20:00] deacon um inis Ababa when I was still a
[1:20:03] pastor there and he was very supportive
[1:20:06] yeah I could see that he learned from
[1:20:08] the best yeah so I think that this is
[1:20:10] something that we can learn and I
[1:20:12] thought it was something very important
[1:20:14] to highlight in this interview for uh
[1:20:17] for Our Generation to learn from that so
[1:20:21] what would you
[1:20:23] consider uh would be the right approach
[1:20:25] to
[1:20:28] Ministry in which way well um we
[1:20:34] we yester yesterday um I think you
[1:20:38] preached to us a very wonderful service
[1:20:40] yes and you spoke about the
[1:20:44] bearing uh a minister can be a minister
[1:20:46] but with a wrong bearing oh
[1:20:49] yes yes um if you could please expound
[1:20:52] on
[1:20:53] that uh uh the ministry has has good
[1:20:56] many
[1:20:57] aspects and it depends on
[1:21:00] why why you in the ministry
[1:21:03] MH because I know there are people in
[1:21:06] the ministry to make to make themselves
[1:21:09] money
[1:21:11] mhm uh they can't sacrifice anything
[1:21:14] yeah like if you see the time we started
[1:21:17] we didn't have anything yeah and we
[1:21:19] didn't start ministering because we we
[1:21:22] needed money I didn't take tithe in the
[1:21:24] church for many years mhm so many years
[1:21:28] I preach without taking tithes MH and
[1:21:30] when I started taking tithes it was very
[1:21:33] late most of that tithe was plowed back
[1:21:37] in the ministry MH so if your ambition
[1:21:40] is
[1:21:42] money Minister goes after money goes go
[1:21:47] God gets away mhm I think that St me is
[1:21:50] the in one of the life story he says mhm
[1:21:55] so if the motive is money mhm that
[1:21:58] preacher lost it mhm if that that
[1:22:01] preacher the motive is
[1:22:04] riches then that man is already finished
[1:22:08] before he starts mhm and some people
[1:22:11] want to preach because they they think
[1:22:13] being a preacher is something that gives
[1:22:15] them status mhm and they being called a
[1:22:19] minister of the of the message makes
[1:22:21] them look look great mhm and those are
[1:22:25] wrong
[1:22:27] motives so if you have those motives
[1:22:30] that's why it is very easy for you to go
[1:22:32] away into wrong Doctrine mhm because
[1:22:35] your motives are not right exactly when
[1:22:38] you have wrong motives you will never
[1:22:40] end right mhm but if God has called you
[1:22:44] and God has put the burden of the church
[1:22:46] into your heart
[1:22:48] mhm this is a man who would spend time
[1:22:51] looking in the Bible in the message to
[1:22:54] know what he's going to say is what it
[1:22:57] is true and what will benefit the
[1:23:00] people because I believe preaching the
[1:23:03] message is not only reciting
[1:23:05] whatam says I believe it's getting the
[1:23:08] spirit of the message MH and I believe
[1:23:13] that's where you can get the right
[1:23:14] bearing if you can get the spirit of the
[1:23:18] Prophet amen get what the you know John
[1:23:23] said I was in the spirit of the Lord's
[1:23:25] day and if you can get if a minister can
[1:23:28] get in the spirit you know there is one
[1:23:31] thing just to speak things that you are
[1:23:32] not in the
[1:23:33] spirit so if the minister can get the
[1:23:36] spirit get the Revelation get himself in
[1:23:39] that atmosphere where the Holy Ghost can
[1:23:41] get
[1:23:42] him then you have somebody who can help
[1:23:45] you amen yeah so it goes to the motive
[1:23:49] why someone is entering into the
[1:23:52] ministry wonderful mhm yeah and I
[1:23:56] believe if we censored ourself along
[1:23:58] those lines some of us would rather sit
[1:24:01] down M and give up yeah yeah some people
[1:24:05] make uh or look at ministry as a way of
[1:24:09] enriching themselves as a way of having
[1:24:11] soft life which is
[1:24:14] unfortunate because you realize
[1:24:16] sometimes in our churches like the rural
[1:24:20] churches you find even the pastor
[1:24:22] sometimes you have to to give the people
[1:24:25] yeah you have to take care of them that
[1:24:27] happens a lot even yeah some of them are
[1:24:29] sick and they can't go to hospital you
[1:24:31] have to you know so if you went in
[1:24:33] because you want to be rich actually I
[1:24:36] noticed in Africa yeah most pastors are
[1:24:41] like fathers to their congregation is it
[1:24:44] yeah so if is the motive of getting
[1:24:48] rich then you go to the wrong motive and
[1:24:52] I believe in spiritually you're not
[1:24:54] correct M you're not correctly wired
[1:24:57] spiritually yeah I love the way you
[1:25:00] phrased it you're not correctly wired
[1:25:03] spiritually yeah if your your motive is
[1:25:05] money and your motive is riches to drive
[1:25:08] a big car yes to do this yes I think you
[1:25:12] are not correctly wired spiritually yeah
[1:25:15] there's a problem there there's a
[1:25:16] problem there my my my and then you see
[1:25:21] also you touch that part of uh because
[1:25:24] because of the wrong motive you you find
[1:25:28] them also going into wrong Doctrine
[1:25:29] Doctrine that's
[1:25:31] right um someone can easily change their
[1:25:34] Doctrine simply
[1:25:36] because there is money somewhere yeah
[1:25:39] and this what we have seen some of the
[1:25:41] doctrines that come especially from
[1:25:45] outside they are sponsored by people of
[1:25:47] money M and we have seen our brothers
[1:25:50] change camps from one group to another
[1:25:52] one M they eating money from this group
[1:25:56] then they they see this group as come as
[1:25:58] more money you find they are there MH
[1:26:00] when that one seems to go down there's
[1:26:02] another group that has come with money
[1:26:04] they are there they seem to smell where
[1:26:06] money is yeah and if a preacher does
[1:26:09] that that's not much you going to put
[1:26:10] your life into his hands yeah I would
[1:26:13] rather have somebody that has nothing
[1:26:16] amen but has the conviction and has the
[1:26:19] revelation of the message and dedicated
[1:26:21] the message amen and he's ready to stand
[1:26:23] and die for amen then have somebody that
[1:26:26] looks wonderful wonderful words speaking
[1:26:29] Mysteries but he goes around following
[1:26:31] any type of win because of money MH I I
[1:26:35] think that would be
[1:26:37] terrible uh that's very good C and we
[1:26:41] appreciate that um I think if you are
[1:26:44] listening in and you're a minister you
[1:26:46] have to check your motives the motives
[1:26:48] why it why is it that you are getting
[1:26:50] into the ministry um is it for fame is
[1:26:52] it for money is it for something else
[1:26:54] you must have as we've heard it in his
[1:26:57] own words you must have a right
[1:26:59] conviction a right conviction of why you
[1:27:02] are getting into the ministry well we
[1:27:04] are getting almost to our close but
[1:27:06] before we do there a few more things
[1:27:08] that I would like you to comment on
[1:27:11] speaking of wrong doctrines there are
[1:27:13] many that we can be able to talk about
[1:27:14] certainly starting the ministry 1975
[1:27:16] you've seen a lot of Winds of camps and
[1:27:19] ideologies within the message but
[1:27:22] there's one that I would like you to
[1:27:23] specific specifically address being that
[1:27:26] you when you first started out actually
[1:27:28] you're coming to the message started on
[1:27:30] a tape listening to a tape yeah there
[1:27:33] are those who uh say
[1:27:37] that pastors should sit down preachers
[1:27:40] should sit down we should only play the
[1:27:43] tape for the people play the tape on on
[1:27:47] on weddings play the tape on Outreach
[1:27:50] play the tape in churches and the work
[1:27:52] of the right
[1:27:54] minister is to play the tape for the
[1:27:57] people how did you when you first
[1:27:59] started out what was your approach to
[1:28:00] that and and and what would you advise
[1:28:02] Our Generation
[1:28:04] today when we started out we didn't have
[1:28:08] that we had tips of course we had tips
[1:28:12] from the brothers
[1:28:14] abroad we listen to the tips but we had
[1:28:19] preaching MH and I I can tell you thatth
[1:28:23] from my my
[1:28:25] experience sometimes the people listen
[1:28:27] to the tips and they don't get the what
[1:28:29] is in the tips H but the preacher comes
[1:28:33] in and preaches the same message and
[1:28:37] explain and expounding on what will say
[1:28:40] and people say we didn't see it I can
[1:28:43] now understand it better yeah so if we
[1:28:46] go the approach of the preacher should
[1:28:48] sit down and the tap should be
[1:28:50] everything it means we'll be contrary to
[1:28:53] the message because brother
[1:28:55] says um he quotes Ephesians
[1:28:59] 41 that when he ascended on high he gave
[1:29:02] gifts unto men some he gave
[1:29:06] prophets Apostles evangelist teachers
[1:29:11] pastors and he says this was for the
[1:29:14] edification of the church and the for
[1:29:16] Unity of the
[1:29:18] faith so if we get these people sit down
[1:29:21] and they're doing nothing it means that
[1:29:24] part of the scriptures we are putting it
[1:29:26] down yeah number two brother says the
[1:29:31] bride will have a
[1:29:33] Ministry and he tells us that the
[1:29:35] ministry is a five-fold Ministry
[1:29:38] yes when when Jesus was on
[1:29:42] Earth all the God had dwelt in him and
[1:29:45] the ministry was in his hands but on the
[1:29:48] day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost
[1:29:50] came upon the disciples the ministry
[1:29:52] expounded to many other
[1:29:57] vessels we know when was here the
[1:29:59] message was in his
[1:30:01] hands but that was a prophet that where
[1:30:05] the word came to the prophet but after
[1:30:08] he's going God would raise up men who
[1:30:12] will cut out the
[1:30:13] ministry and that would be within the
[1:30:16] fivefold
[1:30:17] ministry and brother said if you are
[1:30:20] called to preach preach yeah if you are
[1:30:23] called to teach teaching so how do you
[1:30:26] preach when you are playing the tap yeah
[1:30:29] so the thing is it's good stand between
[1:30:34] the between the lines between the lines
[1:30:37] the TS should be listened to yes the
[1:30:39] preacher should preach yes the book
[1:30:42] should be read and the preacher should
[1:30:44] preach double amen so the whole thing
[1:30:46] should be there the TS should be
[1:30:48] listened to and the preachers to preach
[1:30:50] fire mhm and let the people get what the
[1:30:53] TS say the preacher get what the the
[1:30:56] inspiration in the tips and they preach
[1:30:59] the message amen yeah that's what I
[1:31:01] believe and if you say no tips you are
[1:31:05] wrong if you say no preachers you are
[1:31:08] wrong yes but the the the right thing is
[1:31:10] to have both of them together amen yeah
[1:31:14] so people should read the message listen
[1:31:16] to the tapes but also should come under
[1:31:18] the preaching of their Pastor in fact
[1:31:20] because of this because of that Doctrine
[1:31:22] some people don't go called Church yeah
[1:31:25] and that's wrong because says you should
[1:31:27] have a church which you call your home
[1:31:30] Church MH where You' go and pay your
[1:31:33] tith exactly and support support support
[1:31:36] the work of God Amen so when you sit at
[1:31:39] home and say you in the message you are
[1:31:40] breaking the message because you don't
[1:31:43] have a church and you are not supporting
[1:31:45] any any Ministry by your ti mhm so those
[1:31:50] who say they are streaming or they are
[1:31:53] listening to at home they may think
[1:31:56] they're doing something very spiritual
[1:31:57] but they are in error mhm
[1:32:00] yeah it's very unfortunate and also
[1:32:04] these Ministries have roles the pastor
[1:32:06] like I said yesterday the pastor is like
[1:32:08] a nurse yes you need a nurse in your
[1:32:11] life a spiritual nurse so when you take
[1:32:14] a TP a t cannnot nurse
[1:32:17] you I have seen people use the tape for
[1:32:21] for for what for
[1:32:25] wedding or dedicating of
[1:32:27] children that is to me that's
[1:32:29] Catholicism yeah where you use the dead
[1:32:32] Saints to pray for the people we ask to
[1:32:34] pray for the people and we should not
[1:32:36] make brother Branham one of the Catholic
[1:32:40] saints God gave Ministries and he said
[1:32:44] you have a pastor yes and ask your your
[1:32:46] pastor with the questions yes so I would
[1:32:49] believe if we take the message take it
[1:32:50] as it is yes yeah and the danger is we
[1:32:55] may do that and Elevate to an idol yeah
[1:32:58] which is not good also yeah yeah because
[1:33:02] you see brother bham um is the a
[1:33:06] messenger pointing us to Christ not to
[1:33:09] himself yeah so we are not pointing
[1:33:11] people to brother Branham we are
[1:33:12] pointing people to the Christ that he
[1:33:14] pointed us to that's a very major point
[1:33:16] because brother branham's Ministry is a
[1:33:20] replay of John's Ministry yeah and when
[1:33:23] John say said Behold the Lamb of God mhm
[1:33:26] those disciples who are with him they
[1:33:28] followed who Jesus MH they went to
[1:33:32] Jesus so John pointed them to Jesus and
[1:33:35] they followed Jesus brother Bram points
[1:33:37] us to Jesus and we must follow Jesus
[1:33:40] Jesus
[1:33:41] yeah so uh our listeners we are about to
[1:33:45] come to a close um and so I'll ask the
[1:33:48] pastor maybe one or two more questions
[1:33:51] and then he will give his final remarks
[1:33:53] and then we will bring it to a close but
[1:33:54] before we do I'd like to let you know if
[1:33:56] you have any question and you listening
[1:33:58] in and you'd like to ask the pastor
[1:34:00] please write it on the comment section
[1:34:03] send send in your questions especially
[1:34:05] about the things he's been talking about
[1:34:07] maybe something he say that you would
[1:34:08] like him to throw more light on or
[1:34:10] something else that he did not talk
[1:34:12] about that you would like him to talk
[1:34:13] about please send it in and then we'll
[1:34:16] read it for him shortly and if you're
[1:34:19] here as well and you have a question you
[1:34:20] just raise up your hand and uh will let
[1:34:24] you ask your question uh one more thing
[1:34:27] about um in the brother banam says that
[1:34:31] I mean no one should stand behind a pull
[1:34:35] pit behind the sacred desk if they are
[1:34:36] not filled with the Holy Spirit or if
[1:34:39] they've not had that experience and
[1:34:41] you've told us about your experience way
[1:34:44] back in the 70s I'm sure you've had more
[1:34:47] experiences since
[1:34:49] then uh what would you say to someone
[1:34:53] who sincerely believes this message but
[1:34:56] has never had an experience and he
[1:34:58] actually claims or she claims I'm fine
[1:35:01] because I
[1:35:02] believe shouldn't every believer be um
[1:35:06] baptized into the Holy Ghost and have an
[1:35:09] experience
[1:35:10] thereof I believe brother bam says it's
[1:35:15] compelling it's compelling that every
[1:35:17] person has an experience with
[1:35:20] God and it's unfortunate because of the
[1:35:23] wrong approach the message and the way
[1:35:24] it was taught that some people have a
[1:35:28] slud belief about the Holy Ghost so that
[1:35:32] today when you talk about the Holy Ghost
[1:35:34] people see you are Pentecostal MH but
[1:35:37] you see every true Christian and every
[1:35:41] true uh Bible
[1:35:43] preacher there is no way you preach
[1:35:47] salvation and preach experience with god
[1:35:50] without preaching the baptism of the
[1:35:53] Holy Holy Ghost yeah and there is no way
[1:35:56] as a preacher you can have the depth of
[1:35:59] God without having the baptis of the
[1:36:02] Holy
[1:36:03] Spirit and I don't know what has
[1:36:05] happened because it looks like either we
[1:36:09] are refusing it
[1:36:11] bluntly
[1:36:13] or is a false anointing I don't know
[1:36:17] because every message I play of brother
[1:36:20] Bram he's talking about people being
[1:36:22] filled with the Holy Ghost amen I was
[1:36:25] playing in my church one of the TS where
[1:36:28] was encouraging people to receive the
[1:36:30] Holy Ghost after he
[1:36:31] preached and he would tell people
[1:36:33] surrender surrender to God Just
[1:36:36] Surrender Your Life surrender now and
[1:36:39] then the Holly ghost fell in the in in
[1:36:40] the meeting and fell on on four people
[1:36:43] and says there it is you can see the
[1:36:46] pill fire there he telling brother
[1:36:48] shakarian said you see there it is there
[1:36:50] it is she has received it and that
[1:36:52] sister begins to scream
[1:36:54] the next person the same the next person
[1:36:56] the same and he says 1 2 3 4 have
[1:36:59] received it h so now when you come to
[1:37:02] our preachers
[1:37:04] today and especially in my country I
[1:37:06] don't know what the problem is H because
[1:37:09] even a common sense somebody reading
[1:37:11] with a common sense and listening with
[1:37:13] the common sense there is no way you can
[1:37:15] rub out that it is there deps and you
[1:37:19] run it right from 40s to the time the
[1:37:22] death of brother 6
[1:37:25] 65 so to me it is mandatory mhm and if
[1:37:29] you a preacher without the Holy Ghost
[1:37:31] you are doing yourself at the service
[1:37:32] mhm yeah if you want God to touch you to
[1:37:36] lead you and show you exactly what is
[1:37:39] the riches of his glory amen you need
[1:37:41] the Holy Ghost amen yeah
[1:37:44] amen um and
[1:37:47] that I've been asked by many um and I'm
[1:37:51] sure it would be very helpful coming
[1:37:54] from an elder such as
[1:37:57] yourself how someone out there might
[1:37:59] want to know or someone who will listen
[1:38:02] to this later on how can I receive the
[1:38:06] baptism of the Holy
[1:38:08] Spirit
[1:38:10] um from my own
[1:38:14] experience and from what I seen the
[1:38:17] message total repentance you will repent
[1:38:20] your sins yeah God is obligation to give
[1:38:24] you the Holy Ghost yeah you don't have
[1:38:27] to do anything you
[1:38:29] simply clean your
[1:38:31] heart confess your sins sincerely and
[1:38:35] honestly and be open to go and surrender
[1:38:38] to God just like I've said brother say
[1:38:40] surrender and don't don't look to
[1:38:43] receive the Holy Ghost like so and so or
[1:38:46] don't imagine that when I get I must do
[1:38:48] this you don't know what God will do
[1:38:51] Just Surrender and let God fill you the
[1:38:53] the way he wants amen the way he did to
[1:38:55] me he may not do the same to you he may
[1:38:57] do it his own way so the best thing is
[1:39:01] total repentance and a surrendering her
[1:39:04] to God having faith that this is your
[1:39:08] promise God say it gave it to you it is
[1:39:11] your promise and God will give it to you
[1:39:15] so so if someone keeps one leg one feet
[1:39:19] in the world one feet in Christ it is
[1:39:21] impossible that is why many people don't
[1:39:23] get the Holy Ghost yeah because today
[1:39:25] they're praying for the Holy Ghost
[1:39:26] tomorrow they in the world they come you
[1:39:28] are preaching about the Holy Ghost they
[1:39:30] want the Holy Ghost they go outside here
[1:39:33] they go out of the Holy Ghost so it's on
[1:39:35] and off on and off on and off and some
[1:39:38] decide to then settle in there say oh I
[1:39:40] think God doesn't want to fill me with
[1:39:42] the Holy Spirit yeah I'm I'm in the
[1:39:43] sleeping bride and if you're in the
[1:39:45] sleeping bride you should not be in the
[1:39:47] church by the way if you are sleeping
[1:39:51] bride you should be the Pentecostal yeah
[1:39:53] but you exposed the message here yeah
[1:39:56] and this is where the promise is being
[1:39:58] dished have your
[1:39:59] portion yeah amen amen that can never be
[1:40:03] overemphasized I wish you would talk
[1:40:05] more about this I mean I was just
[1:40:06] beginning to feel so
[1:40:09] good I'm sure there's much more that can
[1:40:11] be said about this quite a lot about the
[1:40:14] BT B of the Holy Ghost is quite a lot a
[1:40:17] lot yes and the examples in the message
[1:40:20] are several several you look at people
[1:40:23] how they they receive the holy ghost in
[1:40:24] the message leave alone the Bible
[1:40:27] because you know when you say the Bible
[1:40:28] they tell you we are not in the book of
[1:40:29] Acts and yet we are being destroyed the
[1:40:31] book of Acts you see restoration is not
[1:40:34] having a new thing I have heard people
[1:40:37] say in this message we are higher than
[1:40:40] higher than the book of Acts if you are
[1:40:42] higher than the book of Acts then you
[1:40:44] are not preaching restoration MH because
[1:40:47] restoration is bringing us bringing us
[1:40:48] back the book of Acts amen and making
[1:40:51] this word live in our day like it live
[1:40:53] then so if you say you have something
[1:40:57] higher than what Paul had then I doubt
[1:41:00] you m you seem to have gone beyond the
[1:41:03] limits of God yeah now Pastor batita
[1:41:07] there is one more question I think this
[1:41:09] will be maybe the last or the second
[1:41:11] last amount I don't know I usually ask
[1:41:13] it to
[1:41:14] elders and um I do not know how it will
[1:41:17] come across to you I'm sure you are not
[1:41:19] prepared for it but I have to ask it
[1:41:22] what was or what is your greatest
[1:41:27] regret since you came into the ministry
[1:41:31] something that you did uh that you you
[1:41:34] you you can you can feel at Liberty to
[1:41:36] share with the younger generation and
[1:41:38] say Here's the mistake that I did and I
[1:41:40] pray that you never do the same H I've
[1:41:43] made many mistakes very
[1:41:45] many very
[1:41:48] many um one of the things I regret now
[1:41:52] mhm when when you pick this
[1:41:54] message I personally I look to the
[1:41:57] message from legalistic point mhm where
[1:42:01] you are not doing
[1:42:03] right you are not
[1:42:05] this and I think we had many people
[1:42:09] MH so that
[1:42:11] um we didn't preach the message with
[1:42:14] Grace MH some of the problems we have is
[1:42:17] the way we handled the message in the
[1:42:18] beginning
[1:42:20] mhm it's not our fault but because we
[1:42:23] didn't have a pastor MH we didn't have
[1:42:25] somebody leading us mhm it was we
[1:42:27] looking in the books and also you did
[1:42:29] not have the full message full message
[1:42:31] and the full knowledge of the message
[1:42:33] yeah but where I am now if I'm given a
[1:42:36] second time there are people we
[1:42:39] communicated I should not excommunicate
[1:42:41] yeah there are people you know we send
[1:42:43] away from church and I would not send
[1:42:45] them away today mhm yeah MH the the the
[1:42:49] way we presented this message mhm and in
[1:42:53] a legalistic way mhm that was not right
[1:42:56] MH yeah and and that is very good for
[1:43:01] our younger ministers to know that this
[1:43:05] message is a message of Grace and one
[1:43:07] thing Pastor batita I did not expect you
[1:43:10] to say this on the interview because I
[1:43:11] know you've you've said that to me
[1:43:13] before uh when I was visiting you with
[1:43:16] you but uh one thing that you've
[1:43:19] continued to impact me with is the your
[1:43:21] humility your ability to come out and
[1:43:25] say well I was wrong with that I ought
[1:43:28] not to have done that and I realize
[1:43:31] there also a very big weakness in the
[1:43:34] ministry among the ministers that you
[1:43:37] know he will do something which will
[1:43:38] hurt the people but he cannot be able to
[1:43:39] own up and say I ought not to have done
[1:43:42] that that was wrong but the greatest
[1:43:45] preacher is one that can say I'm wrong
[1:43:48] yeah because we are we not super
[1:43:52] Supernatural M we are human beings M
[1:43:56] sometimes you can preach an idea and
[1:43:58] sometimes the idea is not right yeah and
[1:44:00] sometimes we find is not right MH and
[1:44:03] you should come back and say I think
[1:44:04] here I was not I was not right yeah so
[1:44:08] the problem is today we have ministers
[1:44:11] who feel they are right and they're holy
[1:44:14] and everything they say is from the
[1:44:16] presence of God and it cannot be
[1:44:18] challenged yeah it cannot be challenged
[1:44:20] which is wrong which is wrong
[1:44:23] praise the Lord I I I think that that
[1:44:26] that really is so impacting it is so
[1:44:28] impacting and so um the many who would
[1:44:32] even excommunicate some people simply
[1:44:34] because they're not part of their Camp
[1:44:36] which is not right and that's that's a
[1:44:39] spirit of that I've really been grieving
[1:44:41] about where because I disagree with you
[1:44:44] I can't have you in my company MH
[1:44:48] because I disagree with you I should not
[1:44:49] have so and so come come to see you MH
[1:44:53] that is a bad approach and that's a bad
[1:44:55] spirit and others even help other
[1:44:58] ministers help other ministers hate
[1:45:00] other ministers on their behalf that is
[1:45:02] true which is wrong it should never be
[1:45:05] encouraged it's an evil spirit and
[1:45:08] that's what brother W wers about yeah
[1:45:11] yeah you are my brother whatever you do
[1:45:16] and you have done a mistake I should
[1:45:19] look at your mistake as you didn't mean
[1:45:21] it mhm Satan has done it MH our biggest
[1:45:25] enemy is the devil yes yeah we are
[1:45:27] fighting the devil MH and so if the
[1:45:29] devil uses you to do something I should
[1:45:31] not really put it on you m yeah it's the
[1:45:34] devil doing it exactly
[1:45:36] yeah well I think we are coming to a
[1:45:39] close here and um I'm going to ask the
[1:45:42] pastor to say a few um his last remarks
[1:45:47] uh whatever it is that is on his heart
[1:45:49] his admonition to the young people to
[1:45:51] the uh young Min
[1:45:53] SS uh but before that I still give a
[1:45:56] chance to anyone who has um something
[1:45:59] that he would like the pastor to speak
[1:46:02] about um as you all know Pastor vti has
[1:46:06] now been ministering uh preaching this
[1:46:08] message for 50 years it's amazing 51 51
[1:46:13] now yeah 51 51 years goodness I'm not
[1:46:17] even 4
[1:46:19] yet so we really thank God to have to to
[1:46:23] to have an opportunity to sit down with
[1:46:25] you here today on the bench It's a grand
[1:46:27] grand opportunity and we couldn't um in
[1:46:31] any way take it for granted we so much
[1:46:32] appreciate your time that you have um uh
[1:46:36] taken to come and be with us here this
[1:46:38] is not for you it is for us it is for
[1:46:41] Our Generation it is for the generation
[1:46:43] after and so if you have anything that
[1:46:47] you would like which I know you do uh to
[1:46:49] maybe look to towards this camera and
[1:46:52] and say to to our
[1:46:54] listeners
[1:46:56] please what I would
[1:46:59] say this message is
[1:47:03] true I have lived with it it has been my
[1:47:08] support I have been through many
[1:47:10] occasions in very many difficult
[1:47:12] situations this message has proved to be
[1:47:16] alive
[1:47:18] um I have had spectacular healings in my
[1:47:22] life
[1:47:24] and it's because of this message because
[1:47:26] I know if I was not a beli of this
[1:47:30] message I will not be alive
[1:47:33] today I remember in the ' 80s I got a
[1:47:36] kidney problem that was so
[1:47:38] serious and I should have
[1:47:41] died when I was sent for the X-rays I
[1:47:44] pleed with God I said God if you can't
[1:47:47] heal me now it will be hard for me to be
[1:47:50] healed later on because my faith to
[1:47:52] climb
[1:47:53] to a place where I can be healed would
[1:47:55] be heard I just ask you when I go to the
[1:47:58] table of xray do
[1:48:00] something and let that man when he read
[1:48:02] the the what he has been xray find
[1:48:05] nothing
[1:48:07] wrong and when I went to the X-ray table
[1:48:10] they did the
[1:48:11] X-ray and the man was very sympathetic
[1:48:13] with me but when he went to read he
[1:48:18] looked and it's surprising he told me
[1:48:20] what is wrong there's nothing wrong you
[1:48:23] okay and when he said that I had
[1:48:26] something like a shock pass through my
[1:48:28] body and that pain
[1:48:30] went and I got healed
[1:48:33] completely I later on I went to school
[1:48:37] that one one morning after
[1:48:39] that I taught in the class and then went
[1:48:43] to my car to take a cup of tea and the
[1:48:46] devil told me you are just imagining you
[1:48:47] are sick and I said sure I don't think I
[1:48:50] was sick and that pain came back right
[1:48:53] there I said oh God forgive me forgive
[1:48:57] me for doubting I know you healed me and
[1:49:00] the pain
[1:49:01] went I had other complications I've had
[1:49:04] psoriasis
[1:49:05] psoriasis
[1:49:07] aate skin problem and my skin would
[1:49:11] would disintegrate in a very short time
[1:49:13] it was all eaten up
[1:49:14] purches and I live that problem for
[1:49:18] long but one day I woke up and told my
[1:49:21] wife it is over I'm I'm not going to
[1:49:23] have it
[1:49:24] anymore I believe what brother Abraham
[1:49:26] said and I confess healing and the thing
[1:49:31] went we I have read I have told you
[1:49:35] about my eyes went off yeah and I could
[1:49:38] not
[1:49:39] see and I want whoever is listening and
[1:49:42] is sick to believe that God is able to
[1:49:45] do it amen amen I could not see I went
[1:49:49] to class to
[1:49:51] teach and the children would make fun of
[1:49:53] me because I'm not
[1:49:55] seeing I would meet people on the way
[1:49:57] and they would look at me and they
[1:49:59] pass but God did a miracle one day one
[1:50:03] time I was in school my sister she's now
[1:50:07] diseased came with a husband in a
[1:50:10] car took the key of the car and gave me
[1:50:13] told me drive this car I said I can't
[1:50:16] drive you know he said I've told you
[1:50:18] drive it so I got the car started to
[1:50:21] drive and as we went I saw I can see to
[1:50:25] my amazement the amazement of people are
[1:50:27] looking and from that time God has help
[1:50:31] me I'm able to drive at least I'm able
[1:50:33] to read my Bible to read the
[1:50:35] message and before you couldn't read the
[1:50:38] Bible you couldn't drive actually by the
[1:50:40] time the
[1:50:41] time uh the I went off even preparing to
[1:50:45] preach was quite a labor and when I
[1:50:49] wrote I wrote very big things to be able
[1:50:51] to read if I show show you my nodes they
[1:50:54] big big letters so that I can read them
[1:50:56] struggling sometimes I had a hand lens
[1:50:59] to look at what I was writing and
[1:51:02] reading but God is good amen the doctor
[1:51:05] told me you will not see again don't
[1:51:07] even come you're going blind but I'm I'm
[1:51:11] I'm praising the Lord today 24 years
[1:51:14] after I'm still able to see amen amen uh
[1:51:19] recently you heard that I got a osed
[1:51:23] with the
[1:51:25] cancer and uh I I took a lot of
[1:51:29] inspiration from brother Spencer if you
[1:51:32] have listened to brother Spencer I'm a
[1:51:35] good listener to brother Spencer yes
[1:51:36] brother Ron Spencer has a wonderful test
[1:51:40] spener and when this happened to
[1:51:43] me I remember one of the statements he
[1:51:47] met the devil likes to use fear in
[1:51:50] cancer so I said if that be it I will
[1:51:54] not
[1:51:56] fear so when the doctor tells me you
[1:51:58] have cancer I said
[1:52:00] Doctor uh if I have cancer it's okay I'm
[1:52:04] not scared because I know if I fear the
[1:52:08] SAT will take
[1:52:09] advantage but I know one thing God is
[1:52:12] able to heal me amen and if he doesn't
[1:52:14] heal me and my time has come to go I'm
[1:52:17] willing to
[1:52:18] go and um I want to thank the brother
[1:52:22] all over the country and all over the
[1:52:25] the Eastern Africa place all over they
[1:52:28] were praying for me remember when you
[1:52:29] were having meetings here yes with
[1:52:32] brother Timothy I sent a request yes and
[1:52:36] God has been
[1:52:37] gracious that thing God to get away amen
[1:52:41] amen uh the last time I took my PSA it
[1:52:44] was 0.4 H and it was 30 amen I thank God
[1:52:49] so much amen amen so I want to encourage
[1:52:52] en everybody this message is working
[1:52:55] this message is able to save this
[1:52:57] message is able to heal amen this
[1:52:59] message is able to do great
[1:53:02] things if I would give my testimony to
[1:53:05] would take
[1:53:07] time and I don't think time allows it
[1:53:11] but for the young
[1:53:12] people you are not you are not wrong or
[1:53:17] you are not
