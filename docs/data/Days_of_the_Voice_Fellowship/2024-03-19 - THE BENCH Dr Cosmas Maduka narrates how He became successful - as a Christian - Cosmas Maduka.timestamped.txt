[0:00] can give you a little time to you know
[0:01] narrate and not only narrate but also
[0:04] tell our young people how you arrived
[0:06] here because the reason why I ask this
[0:09] question is we have a lot of get rich
[0:12] quick schemes sure and brother bam
[0:14] talked about that and many young people
[0:15] think that they can arrive at wealth in
[0:18] just a blink of an eye you know invest
[0:20] you know one you know one naira or one
[0:22] Shillings and get 500 million in in an
[0:25] overnight yeah so how how was this
[0:28] possible for you okay you know um my
[0:32] story sometime I thought it could have
[0:34] been balling to a lot of people because
[0:38] I have just simple one story that I've
[0:41] repeatedly you know tell around the
[0:44] world um but as an individual I believe
[0:48] our story is somewhat unique unique in
[0:51] the sense that um um um I am a
[0:57] manifestation of the grace of God as an
[1:01] individual uh because
[1:03] um um when you people sing that
[1:09] hym from grass to riches he took a
[1:13] beggar and make him a king I've never
[1:17] listened to that song without breaking
[1:20] down tears coming from my eyes because
[1:23] that song Tell My Story absolutely my
[1:28] story um
[1:32] I live to in my generation I just think
[1:36] God raised me up to show
[1:40] people that there is no mountain that is
[1:45] insurmountable there's no hell that is
[1:48] too high to Crime William Braham the
[1:51] prophet of this age let us know that it
[1:56] is our attitude yes that brings the
[1:58] result mhm
[2:01] um and he said that from experience he
[2:05] didn't just said that off his head m b
[2:09] was gifted he was a messenger and a
[2:12] prophet for a
[2:14] generation but he never Clos his leg and
[2:17] sit back and said because I am a
[2:20] messenger I am called for this uh uh
[2:24] generation God will just download all
[2:27] informations from my head but you could
[2:30] still see him really
[2:34] committed to his call yes what I try to
[2:39] tell young people is to pursue purpose
[2:43] and life yes if you pursue
[2:46] purpose every other 10 will add to it
[2:51] and what is purpose purpose is the
[2:54] reason why purose is why you exist exist
[3:00] M purpose
[3:02] is why things is
[3:05] made and the things that are made 90%
[3:09] Almost 100% of the time don't know its
[3:13] purpose the purpose is only in the mind
[3:16] of the maker the manufacturer if you ask
[3:19] this bottle of water why were you made
[3:22] he will not answer you he didn't know
[3:24] yeah but if you ask the person who made
[3:26] it it will tell you this is made for
[3:30] refreshment you can drink it is water if
[3:33] you ask this chair this where were you
[3:36] made he did not know mhm so if you want
[3:40] to know you ask the maker mhm so who is
[3:44] the maker of human being God God so if
[3:48] you don't understand your purpose of
[3:51] existence that's the reason why you need
[3:53] to go to God exactly because the
[3:57] manufacturer build success
[4:00] m in everything that is
[4:03] made but a lot of people try
[4:07] to approach Life by presuming M if you
[4:12] do not understand
[4:15] purpose abuse will be
[4:18] inevitable if I don't know that this was
[4:22] made as a table to hold laptop to hold
[4:25] water I can decide to stand on it I may
[4:29] think it's a uh um I I think that uh
[4:32] it's a standing uh I can sit on it if
[4:35] I'm sitting on this or standing on it
[4:38] I'm abusing it exactly and why am I
[4:40] abusing it because I did not know the
[4:42] purpose for which it is made yeah so if
[4:46] it doesn't serve his
[4:48] purpose then abuse will become
[4:51] inevitable many people abused their life
[4:55] because they did not know the purpose of
[4:57] their existence m now let me back up I
[5:01] was born to one
[5:04] loin that's my mother's name and my
[5:06] father's name is
[5:08] Peter
[5:09] Muk uh 65 years
[5:12] ago um within the 4 years of my
[5:16] existence onto the Earth my father went
[5:20] to be with the Lord I was a young man
[5:23] who do not know my left to right put
[5:27] your eyes in the mind of a four years a
[5:30] baby M um the generation I grew up with
[5:34] those days you have to fake sickness to
[5:37] be able to eat rice rice used to be a
[5:40] delicacy a special food and uh only you
[5:44] can only get it if not for a festival
[5:48] you need to really be sick and refuse to
[5:51] eat other food then they ask you can't
[5:54] we find you something to eat what will
[5:56] you eat then you say rice but there was
[5:59] this particular day that everybody was
[6:02] kind to me I ate rice more than five
[6:06] times or eight times anybody pass what
[6:08] you eat rice and I was saying oh my God
[6:11] what a wonderful day this kind of day
[6:13] should never end and uh I I you know
[6:16] some people are come trooping into our
[6:19] house it was like a festival you know
[6:22] and um masr were coming people were
[6:25] beating music and things but I saw my
[6:28] mother unlike the rest of everybody
[6:31] feeling happy on the one corner of the
[6:34] wall her hair scattered she was crying
[6:37] and I was asking what's making her angry
[6:39] everybody is Happy why is she uh
[6:43] unhappy L little did I know that that
[6:46] was the funeral of my father but I saw
[6:49] my father in a black suit with a white
[6:53] shade on a bow tie lying on a bed so I
[6:57] thought he was taking a nap h I didn't
[7:00] know what it is but letterer in my life
[7:03] that's the best I can say I knew my
[7:05] father so life was rough uh gave me no
[7:09] opportunity to survive or become
[7:12] anything in life um it was really really
[7:16] difficult but I still respect a lot of
[7:21] Godly women uh William Braham the
[7:24] prophet of this age told us that a Godly
[7:26] mother is the first pastor of the house
[7:29] yes and that the New Testament has four
[7:32] book and the mother is the Fifth
[7:35] Gospel um I can truly say I experienced
[7:39] that with my mother my mother was not a
[7:42] Pentecostal or a message person but was
[7:45] a devoted Catholic and really you know
[7:49] she was committed to her belief MH and
[7:54] um if you ask me to say I would say
[7:57] created the hunger of God in Me because
[8:00] she wakes us up when I was in that age
[8:04] early morning by 5:00 for morning
[8:07] devotion and we had to pray Catholic
[8:10] rosing you know in Our Father who is in
[8:13] heaven you know after that we say hell
[8:15] Mar full of grace 10 times
[8:19] repeatedly and that was where initially
[8:23] it was difficult but like everything in
[8:26] life practice makes perfect yes and the
[8:30] more you do things the more you get
[8:32] accustomed to it and you love it I saw
[8:35] my mother pray all night
[8:39] really Desiring for God because life was
[8:43] unfair to her she was at tender age her
[8:47] husband went to be with the Lord and he
[8:49] has four kids to take care of so she
[8:52] doesn't have anybody but God and
[8:56] introduce try to introduce this God to
[8:59] us
[9:00] when I was too young so many time we
[9:03] wake up and we are feeling sleepy
[9:06] sometime he will use her five pums on
[9:09] our botom to wake us up or any of us
[9:12] feeling sleepy if you that sleep never
[9:15] left you she has a cup of water she
[9:17] emptied it in your head that was the
[9:19] worst that I almost hate God for that
[9:21] one I just said what kind of God is this
[9:24] that this cold water come on your head
[9:26] in the morning then sleep will disappear
[9:29] but that was how she knew that's the
[9:32] best she knew she has good
[9:34] intention so from then when I started
[9:38] growing up I wasn't waiting for my
[9:40] mother again to lead me for prayer I
[9:43] started praying on my own you know
[9:45] started having hunger and desire for god
[9:49] um we were Catholics that's our
[9:51] background um I became an alter boy yes
[9:55] I was an alter boy you know I was a mass
[9:56] servant you know try everything I can
[10:00] but
[10:02] again if the way to live a life is to be
[10:08] honest yes if there's anything even till
[10:11] today when I talk to Believers I said if
[10:14] there's one thing God want us to bring
[10:16] on the table yes it's our honest of
[10:19] purpose forget your mistake forget about
[10:22] anything because you are human being but
[10:25] will you be honest to own up not looking
[10:28] for anybody to to hold you in your
[10:30] Adam's ample to get you to accept when
[10:33] you are wrong exactly God required that
[10:36] depth of sincerity and if there's
[10:38] anything that set William Braham has
[10:41] apart from his contemporary was that
[10:44] level of depth of sincerity and approach
[10:46] to God
[10:48] yeah because he knew you can't fool God
[10:50] you can fool a man but you can't fool
[10:52] God so if you can approach god with that
[10:56] attitude of depth of sincerity
[10:59] the sky is your limit yeah in fact you
[11:02] won't have limit because what William BL
[11:05] told us that a man or a woman that
[11:08] completely surrender his heart to God is
[11:11] an omin poent when God can get you to a
[11:14] point you have no reservation you truly
[11:17] want to empty out and let him come in
[11:20] then he can use you because the the
[11:24] number one enemy you have is not your
[11:26] husband is not your wife it's not your
[11:28] uncle it's not your children it's not
[11:31] your father it's yourself exactly so if
[11:33] you can get yourself out of the way MH
[11:36] then God will have his way in your life
[11:38] yeah so while you continue sorry to
[11:41] interrupt you you spoke of of your
[11:43] mother so it all whenever I hear you
[11:46] tell this story it really reminds me of
[11:48] my mother and you know most of the
[11:51] people that are listening to us are
[11:52] young people as I told you of this and
[11:55] we see that uh the younger generation
[11:58] the women no longer want to uh be women
[12:01] and no longer want to be wives and take
[12:03] care of children and train them and
[12:05] raise them in the fear of God but if a a
[12:08] Catholic mother can be able to do that
[12:10] and instill the fear of God in you how
[12:12] much more a believing woman can do well
[12:16] I think a believing woman should do much
[12:18] better uh in every sense because we were
[12:23] once like half spiritual Amia but when
[12:28] we came in into this message this end
[12:31] time message God sent William Braham to
[12:34] reveal the heart of God to us yeah so we
[12:38] we are like having an open book we are
[12:40] not gazing Stars anymore we are not
[12:43] supposed to be speculating we are not
[12:45] know this we should know better nobody
[12:48] I've never heard it from anybody that
[12:51] mother is the first pastor of the house
[12:53] I never heard it from anybody that that
[12:56] the gospel had Fifth Gospel and mother
[12:59] should occupy that place so B had used
[13:02] different words to show us how important
[13:06] a mother is exactly because most of the
[13:08] problem we have today Frankly Speaking
[13:12] is not child delinquent many parent are
[13:15] Del it's parent delinquency that we are
[13:19] going through there is no authority
[13:21] figure in the house anymore people are
[13:24] not properly guided how they should
[13:29] believe and the love the the parents
[13:32] need to show to their children to be
[13:33] able to you know take them on but let me
[13:37] say that many people can use this as
[13:40] excuse to their life why they are not
[13:43] important but if you think that is
[13:46] excuse I can also have good excuse
[13:50] because part of the excuse is that I
[13:52] didn't have father care Over Me growing
[13:56] up so at the end of the day we are
[14:02] individually responsible for the choices
[14:05] we
[14:07] made many time we don't like it because
[14:11] we like to abrigate responsibility
[14:14] looking for who to blame why we are not
[14:17] who we are supposed to be MH but heart
[14:22] statement the truth is that every one of
[14:25] us is a su total of church choices we
[14:29] have made in life that's right okay many
[14:32] time we don't acknowledge or appreciate
[14:35] it one wrong choice doesn't make
[14:40] you a failure m one right choice doesn't
[14:45] make you
[14:47] successful it's
[14:49] a it's a constant Su total MH of wrong
[14:54] choices you made over a period of time
[14:57] yeah you you become a failure it's a su
[15:01] total of right choices you made over a
[15:05] period of time that make you successful
[15:08] yeah because nobody will say he had
[15:11] never made a mistake so the choices we
[15:13] make really matter they the choices we
[15:16] made in life make at the end of the day
[15:19] we are some total of the choices we made
[15:23] and but a lot of
[15:27] people wonder how can I be successful
[15:32] yeah I
[15:35] believe this is my personal belief that
[15:38] success is predictable yeah okay and
[15:42] failure is also predictable okay
[15:49] because everything a manufacturer build
[15:52] he build success into it mhm so there is
[15:57] a law our
[16:00] success as human beings is good for God
[16:05] God want us to succeed every one of us
[16:09] God never build any of us to be a
[16:12] failure that's right but whether we
[16:15] succeed or fail m is up to us mhm I've
[16:21] had I've discussed with some young
[16:23] people and quite a number of times some
[16:25] of them told me where is the place of
[16:27] Grace in this I'm saying that I am too
[16:30] hard on them where is the place of Grace
[16:33] I said please listen carefully so that
[16:35] you can understand and appreciate it and
[16:38] they listening and they
[16:40] listening I said Grace is an enablement
[16:45] but Grace is not disgrace
[16:48] okay if you read the
[16:52] scripture God told Joshua in Joshua
[16:55] Chapter
[16:57] 1:7 this book of
[17:00] law shall not depart from your mouth you
[17:05] shall meditate in it not only in the
[17:08] night not only in the day day and
[17:12] night then he say for then shall thou
[17:18] be
[17:20] successful there are conditions that is
[17:23] tied to it you don't just only meditate
[17:27] on the book but you
[17:29] said that you should observe to do
[17:33] according to all that is written therein
[17:36] for then shall thou then shall thou make
[17:40] thyself not your uncle not your brother
[17:44] not your sister not then shall thou make
[17:47] thyself prosperous
[17:50] so I then explained to some young people
[17:53] I said look many of you don't understand
[17:57] Destiny mhm I go to different church and
[18:01] I hear them sing a song Destiny changer
[18:05] come and change my destiny destiny today
[18:09] come and change my destiny destiny today
[18:13] I said when they get to that Destiny
[18:15] changer I keep
[18:17] quiet they asked me why did I keep quiet
[18:20] I said I don't want my destiny change I
[18:22] love my destiny why am
[18:25] I you need your own change pray for it
[18:28] to change I don't want my own change I
[18:31] said let me tell you my understanding a
[18:35] little way for you to appreciate Destiny
[18:37] Okay I said if you are born in a rich
[18:42] man family
[18:45] yeah and you want to be a doctor MH if
[18:50] that's your desire MH and your father
[18:53] can pay your school fees to be a doctor
[18:56] you are destining to be a doctor doctor
[19:00] but whether in real life you become a
[19:03] doctor or not is up to you
[19:07] mhm they say how I said because if you
[19:11] want to be a doctor this is a a a
[19:14] discussion you need to have by yourself
[19:18] you can't be a doctor because you say I
[19:20] want to I want to MH you need to have
[19:25] self conversation mhm I want to be a
[19:30] doctor you ask you you you you have
[19:34] discussion with yourself how MH nobody
[19:38] become a doctor by mouth I want to
[19:40] that's right I want to doesn't make you
[19:42] a doctor M so when you make that
[19:46] discussion self
[19:48] conversation I want to be a doctor you
[19:51] ask yourself how you answer the question
[19:55] it's a conversation you're having with
[19:56] yourself to be a doctor I need to be
[19:59] good in five science subject M you are
[20:04] beginning okay I need to be good in math
[20:08] MH extra math English biology
[20:13] chemistry beautiful you are not good at
[20:16] it but you have identified them you are
[20:19] making progress exactly the next thing
[20:21] is that can I get a doctor can I get a
[20:25] teacher who will teach me marks who
[20:28] would teach me English mhm and you find
[20:32] out that these subjects are sometime
[20:34] things that frightens you but there's no
[20:36] fear in it if you get a good coach he
[20:39] will Coach you and before you know it
[20:41] you start exploiting this subject they
[20:44] become very easy for you mhm 6 years or
[20:47] eight from that day you become a doctor
[20:49] mhm if you are willing to learn and your
[20:52] father has the money to pay for your
[20:53] school exactly but if your father pay
[20:56] for your school and you you went go to
[20:59] school and become a rate run around with
[21:03] boys or girls m in 6 years you will not
[21:07] graduate exactly and if your father go
[21:10] and bribe the teacher to gradate you for
[21:15] you to begin to kill human being as a
[21:18] doctor is the worst thing he could do to
[21:21] you and to do to his other fellow human
[21:24] being so if you don't agraduate you need
[21:27] to rewrite that CL again and there time
[21:31] it will reach they will expire you from
[21:33] that school if because if you you you
[21:36] don't have ability
[21:38] to to to retain what you are learning to
[21:42] put it into practice M so so the choices
[21:45] you make really matter really matter
[21:47] they make you they make you so I told
[21:50] the man I said
[21:52] look there are two smart young people
[21:55] who thought they were very clev and they
[21:57] know everything
[21:59] and in their Village there was an
[22:01] elderly man who is very intelligent
[22:05] highly respected because he can decode
[22:08] anything for you and these two smart
[22:10] smart young man decided we're going to
[22:13] make full out of this man we're going to
[22:15] he think he's smart we will show him so
[22:18] they went and got a small B and hid it
[22:22] behind them and get to the Ancient Man
[22:24] and said there is a mystery we want you
[22:27] to decode to us mhm the man said go
[22:30] ahead he said we had a small bed in our
[22:35] back and we want you to tell us whether
[22:38] this bed is alive or dead dead they've
[22:41] already decided if the man said the bed
[22:44] is alive they will squeeze the bed and
[22:47] die die then they will show him a dead
[22:49] bed the man said the bed is H dead is a
[22:52] dead they will show him the bed that is
[22:54] alive so they met the Ancient Man and
[22:57] said can you please explain I told him I
[22:59] said this is what Destiny is up about
[23:01] can you explain whether this bird is
[23:03] life or dead the ancient man said it's
[23:06] not a problem whether this bird is alive
[23:08] or dead is up to you uhhuh that was the
[23:12] question in other words if you like kill
[23:14] the bed or you like keep it alive the
[23:17] question he gave them he said you want
[23:19] to know whether this bed is alive or
[23:22] dead my answer is that it's up to you
[23:25] it's your choice it's your choice you
[23:27] decide whether you want to keep him
[23:29] alive or kill him so this is what
[23:32] Destiny is all about M God had made a
[23:36] provision for every one of us because
[23:40] when he write his vision statement
[23:43] pering human being in Genesis
[23:46] 1:26 he was not under any illusion he
[23:50] said let me make a man mhm in my own
[23:55] likeness after my own kind the way he
[23:59] was is what he wanted to make man mhm so
[24:02] God created a man from beginning to be a
[24:05] Creator MH that's why he didn't even put
[24:08] on wear for the man when he created him
[24:11] he didn't give him a table he didn't
[24:13] give him a sheer he didn't give him a
[24:17] cow why because God wanted man to create
[24:20] it to be part of his creation M he take
[24:24] this table and hit it on the tree H it
[24:28] took this year kept it on the
[24:31] tree he took automobile keep it on the
[24:35] the team o and the in the mountain the
[24:38] only thing God gave his children which
[24:40] is still what we are fighting for God
[24:44] never gave a man car he didn't give him
[24:47] a shoe MH he HD it on the cow but he
[24:50] gave him sense to be able to get the
[24:52] things out of what is created to be able
[24:55] to recreate the only thing God gave man
[24:58] is land mhm is That's Why They Call
[25:01] property real estate it's the only
[25:04] estate that is real yeah that's why
[25:07] that's why they are still fighting in
[25:09] paristan today Overland over every
[25:13] problem of the world is land property
[25:15] that is the only thing God gave to his
[25:17] children yeah and I told some of the
[25:19] young believers who once they get the
[25:22] first money the first thing he bought a
[25:23] car the next one is's looking for I said
[25:26] car is not wealth
[25:29] Bible say a righteous man liveth wealth
[25:33] for his children children children if
[25:36] you can't put money in a property and
[25:39] die your child cannot herit your car if
[25:42] you don't have land you have not left
[25:43] any you because if you want to be a
[25:45] righteous man you follow God's principle
[25:48] m a righteous man liveth wealth for his
[25:50] children so the only estate that is
[25:53] really is property so when you start
[25:55] making money invest in property mhm so
[25:58] that you can live inheritance for your
[26:00] children don't just buy car buy nice
[26:02] suit and these are not inheritance for
[26:04] anybody so God didn't give a man a cloth
[26:08] but he left the cloth on the wool it's a
[26:11] man's responsibility to think outside of
[26:14] the bus to activate his blame to take
[26:18] the wool and be able to make a a clo but
[26:21] the land you cannot make God gave that
[26:25] to you but every other thing it is given
[26:28] in your own power to be able to make so
[26:31] let me continue with my
[26:34] story when I grew up as a young man I
[26:36] have an inquisitive mind m i i
[26:41] because so were you at a place when you
[26:44] are an alter boy and yes an alter boy
[26:46] you know God gave
[26:49] us 5 billion cells in our
[26:54] brain average human being use 10% of it
[26:58] if you get to 12% of it you will become
[27:01] a
[27:03] genius there are every that's why
[27:06] William Braham said everything we
[27:10] require to the resurrection is already
[27:13] in US is not coming it's already there
[27:15] that's right we only need people who can
[27:18] teach us Faith to activate those things
[27:22] and be able to get to our advancement MH
[27:27] because my mother taught me how to pray
[27:30] MH I heard that Mary visited three
[27:33] children at Fatima they told us this
[27:36] story in Catholic M I went to the bush
[27:40] to pray at the age of seven and I was
[27:43] talking to Mary I said I L you going to
[27:46] Fatima you can come to n you can come to
[27:48] my Village I want to see you you know
[27:52] told us about that little child that
[27:56] when the Thunder were
[27:59] um blasing the child was crying and the
[28:03] mother came to the child and said don't
[28:04] worry you know God is with you he said
[28:07] Mom I want god with
[28:09] flesh Soh I want god with flesh I need I
[28:13] needed I didn't want historical God I
[28:17] wanted to feel God I went to the bush I
[28:20] pray I didn't see Mary but that didn't
[28:22] stop that hunger of God in Me yeah
[28:26] because if there's a deep calling in
[28:29] your heart there is a deep somewhere to
[28:31] respond for it there's nothing you are
[28:34] taxing for that God has not provided but
[28:39] the things start from Hunger mhm you can
[28:42] never feed a man or a woman who is not
[28:46] hungry and you can never teach anybody
[28:49] to be hungry hunger is something that
[28:51] comes naturally naturally so if you
[28:54] don't if somebody is not hungry you are
[28:57] giving him food you are wasting time he
[29:00] had to show that he's hungry and that's
[29:02] how it is so that's why I'm saying
[29:05] everything about us it's about choices M
[29:09] as I I think um in a message I think is
[29:12] as I was with Moses B said that 10 years
[29:15] from today you can be an asset to the
[29:18] society but 10 years today you may be
[29:21] cening bathroom because of the choices
[29:24] you make today so our choices matters at
[29:27] the end of the day we are some total M
[29:30] life never gave me opportunity but I
[29:34] choose that I will be different M I
[29:37] choose I will not be like the rest of
[29:40] the other boys I choose I will not go
[29:44] the popular way every other person is
[29:47] going it was my choice MH we were my
[29:50] mother had us we are three boys and a
[29:53] girl the girl is my senior brother
[29:56] senior me and they had a girl we had had
[29:58] a we first three boys and then a girl MH
[30:01] but I was different from all of them not
[30:04] because I have better sense of them but
[30:08] I this my
[30:09] inquisitiveness of trying to know was
[30:12] what led me to my Christian faith
[30:16] because I have this
[30:19] desire my mother had had taught me that
[30:24] there is
[30:25] God and when I was 4 years old she
[30:29] looked me into the eyes and told me to
[30:32] believe in myself MH and to believe in
[30:35] God MH and that I will go places in life
[30:38] and that it would be difficult for
[30:40] people to say no to me
[30:43] MH at that innocent mind I believe
[30:48] everything my mother told me MH and I I
[30:52] I practice it in my life that's why in
[30:55] Genesis the first thing God did to his
[30:57] son is that he blessed them MH and then
[31:01] after he blessed them he gave them five
[31:06] strategic means to be able to be like
[31:09] him mhm dominate subdue control you know
[31:15] so rule this Earth for him when you
[31:17] apply those
[31:19] principle there's nothing that could
[31:21] stop you because so there is a a a a a
[31:25] law of success built on on every product
[31:29] mhm once you obey that success you will
[31:35] get the result take for instance I'm
[31:37] speaking with Dynamic phone mic okay
[31:41] this mic that I'm speaking has a battery
[31:45] inside yeah so this microphone do not
[31:49] want
[31:51] battery it needs
[31:54] battery to be able to function to be
[31:56] able to function so so battery is not a
[32:00] want but if you remove battery from this
[32:03] microphone and you decide to speak in
[32:05] tongue so that you can start speaking
[32:08] you can fast for 40 days days nothing
[32:11] will happen it will not work so you need
[32:14] to obey the law of the
[32:16] manufacturer first of all and the law of
[32:19] manufacturer is to give it battery yeah
[32:22] if you give it battery it will function
[32:24] yeah if you take put battery on it if
[32:26] you like to pray pray that's if you
[32:28] don't like to pray that's up to you but
[32:31] don't do any other thing without giving
[32:33] it battery because battery is a that
[32:37] makes it function so the need for
[32:40] battery is built on it by the
[32:42] manufacturer
