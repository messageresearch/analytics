[24:28] none of us have ever seen jesus face to
[24:42] of people seeing jesus
[24:52] but the bible tells us
[24:56] we don't know what we shall be too many
[25:11] but when he shall appear
[26:07] my sharing
[26:08] knowing who you are
[26:14] praise be to god
[26:16] the prophet says that i know this to be
[26:19] the truth
[26:23] and i know people don't like
[26:25] people don't realize who you are
[26:31] praise be to god
[26:33] every person in here can live above
[27:07] [Music]
[27:18] it's not because of our strengths
[27:22] but because of his grace
[27:25] praise be to god
[27:27] when we know whom we are we treat
[27:29] together
[27:31] we can live above sin just over the time
[27:34] we need our work
[27:35] praise you to god i mean
[27:40] listen
[27:42] you are here
[27:43] you are the covenant people of god women
[27:56] making the covenant swearing by himself
[28:09] amen
[28:26] god did not give us pope he never met
[28:29] pope to leave the church
[28:32] god never committed pope to leave the
[28:34] church
[28:38] but the holy spirit to leave the church
[28:42] because when jesus
[28:46] [Applause]
[29:11] yes
[29:12] he will remain in the air
[29:16] praise be to god i mean it's not going
[29:18] to step here on earth
[29:22] it is us who will
[29:24] be caught up to meet him
[29:28] it is that portion of jesus in you
[29:33] which will make you rise to me to him
[29:38] praise be
[29:48] the quantity of jesus is
[29:50] the and the quality is increasing in us
[30:21] there are things that you can do for
[30:22] that market to lose it is magnetism
[30:30] you can buy it in the soil some of the
[30:32] diseases come attackers you can heat it
[30:34] up
[30:49] way the introduction of course all
[30:50] things that we are doing already
[30:53] which will make us misrupture
[30:55] today
[30:58] praise be to god
[31:00] because when jesus comes
[31:09] [Applause]
[31:15] will be
[31:16] pulled
[31:29] but when it shall appear
[31:43] by the holy ghost
[31:47] doing and acting and performing the same
[31:50] thing he did when he was here on us
[31:55] [Music]
[31:58] you've received it
[31:59] [Music]
[32:01] you have got the covenant
[32:05] it is written to you
[32:08] swear by god
[32:22] when you realize who you are
[33:09] we amen i mean there are things which
[33:12] are impossible physically but possible
[33:14] spiritually
[33:19] because physically
[33:23] it's very hard for someone to find
[33:25] somebody
[33:28] who doesn't know whether he's a male or
[33:30] a human
[33:34] yeah it is very impossible
[33:41] sometimes you find it's very hard to
[33:43] identify whether someone is christian or
[33:44] is not a christian
[33:48] christian
[33:49] christian and that's what i never want
[33:51] saturn is
[33:52] because if we don't know where we are
[33:54] going
[33:55] to determine what you get we don't know
[33:57] why we are leaving
[33:59] then we have no journey
[34:02] yeah there is no purpose
[34:04] but when
[34:05] [Applause]
[34:18] i will go
[34:27] i was just thinking i was just speaking
[34:29] to myself
[34:34] you know when you're coming to church
[34:37] you have to before even that you have to
[34:39] be meditating
[34:41] about church
[34:45] god what do you have for me today
[34:49] please lord i need to see you come on
[34:53] the reason we are not seeing god in our
[34:55] lives
[34:58] why we don't feel his presence
[35:16] [Music]
[35:28] amen you cannot spend two days without
[35:30] talking to a husband and you're okay
[35:37] the people knows that
[35:40] you are white
[35:43] you always want to know what's happening
[35:45] at home
[35:47] and i believe that is how our god is
[35:52] not settling in heaven
[35:54] when we are not calling on him
[36:05] [Applause]
[36:10] let us
[36:23] when we know who we are

[54:53] pentacles to get pentecostal to let them
[54:56] realize who they are
[54:59] [Music]
[55:03] if you only know if you only knew who

[55:32] line
[55:40] [Music]
[55:59] we need the spirit of christ in us
[56:04] because when he the holy ghost is coming
[56:08] it is him who will lead us into the
[56:10] truth
[56:13] he will reveal these things to
[56:40] jesus christ
[56:43] [Music]

[58:25] ceremony
[58:31] they didn't understand it we got a blood
[58:34] sacrifice laying there
[58:40] god doesn't even see you
[58:44] he hears our voices
[58:48] but
[59:11] is the reason
[59:12] of this if you can ever get that
[59:17] the scare out of the church
[59:23] and let them realize who they are and to
[59:26] never take ibani
[59:29] and what they are
[59:39] healing will be the simplest message to
[59:42] be preached or anything else
[59:56] the prophet
[59:57] mentioned this in many many
[1:00:10] the church to know
[1:00:12] who they are
[1:00:22] in fact not only fearing evil but even
[1:00:26] fearing good

[1:03:20] praise be to god
[1:03:22] sometime you pray
[1:03:24] until you feel like you want to prophesy
[1:03:27] the devil tells you
[1:03:42] will sort it out
[1:03:46] amen amen i mean because even the bible
[1:03:50] tells us
[1:03:52] amen
[1:03:53] prophecy
[1:03:56] there must be wittinesses
[1:04:00] and they examine it
[1:04:02] but he never tells us the person who

[1:04:50] amen
[1:04:51] we have to receive from god my friends
[1:04:55] this message is not words
[1:04:58] but god always vindicates each and every
[1:05:01] message that god's fault
[1:05:06] if you listen to every message
[1:05:10] at the beginning of that message or the
[1:05:12] end of the message

[1:09:06] syllable god we have none
[1:09:09] of them
[1:09:11] it did not mean that they had nothing to
[1:09:12] give him
