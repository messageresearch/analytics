moses go in unto pharaoh before i have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants that i might show thee my signs before him [Music] the heart of pharaoh it is because he wants to show his signs if there is something that you are praying for and i've been believing for and it is taking too long to manifest because god wants to show his signs and god sometimes happens the people and the things around us so that he can manifest his signs no signs are not for us amina yes sir amen and that thou may still in the ears of thy son and of thy son son what things i have wrote in egypt and my signs which i have done among them that he may know how that i am the lord [Music] [Music] and moses and aaron came in unto pharaoh and said unto him that saith the lord god of the hebrews how long will thou refuse to humble thyself before me let my people go the day may serve me watch amen hey man you may have your seats uh sister dorothy i'm happy to see you as the daughter was saying and i was you know sharing with a little and i think in the coming weeks i will take a a subject on uh well i'll just keep it for now but there's something i want to speak on in the coming weeks then you cannot and we see that god spoke to uh uh uh moses and aaron down here and spoke to them and and say that a mother said aaron came in under farah and said unto him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews how long will that refuse to humble thyself before me i saw these these hebrews but never beings the hebrews were different and until today i want to tell you there is a promise that god gave them one word and they say that they will possess the gates amen i tell you i've been in ethiopia and i met them with you and i was meeting one man you know i'm saying that when i see you began to tell me that he was in one of the conferences well there was also the ambassador just recently whether i was also the ambassador of the of israel and they were speaking about the ethiopian jews doctors and many you know people dignitaries that live in the northern parts of the country arabic you know because they would just look at you and you can be cast no furniture and they they said they have bad eyes and so they don't like them that conference was trying to see how they can get them back maybe to their homeland or to try and see how they can be able to live and cohabit these people you see let me tell you this is the promise of god election is actually the god of abraham ibrahimovic is have you seen that before mechanism some of you are wondering that's the reason i wouldn't have a problem if you have it here and i was able to inaudible why because god cartoon vindicated himself behind his people america he had a purpose for them and he elected them and he chose them to whoever blesses israel god bless us you the bible tells us to pray he doesn't say pray for the peace of uganda bible together you can pray for the peace of america america pray for the peace of your christ the bible says pray and god did not want them to stay in egypt and i will tell you that is a type of there is a [Applause] shall possess the amen and when jesus overcame satan yesterday amen i mean he buffed many after his kind yes amen i mean as soon as you receive the holy ghost you are like jesus you are also around your sins that was not the purpose why we were born in your sins that's a good thing that's not the reason why i'm here next year i was born for a dwelling for them it's a pardon when they serve god business to them it is something they do when they don't have something god is there is one life to leave god nothing can destroy me i need to be crazy with that hallelujah amen before you become crazy nature it cannot mean anything to you i need to be walking in this world i know i am leaving my purpose because there is a purpose again it is let my people go [Music] is if it will take the ukrainian war oh watching that will tell why you claim god will let it cattle and thousands oh i don't know maybe there are hundreds here oh back at it [Music] israel god deals before you know your purpose why you are born you have not yet realized the instance of life man oh god help me to be able to bring this cat [Music] chasing after i and even when we had a very very serious uh you know gathering at school i would rather escape and go to hear the world i would rather be in church why can't he marry me i would rather be around the world why can't he marry an injury you may call me a fanatic after this but i know what i'm talking about my purpose not doing all the commandments of the law sit down and live in your holy life and then you die no further that is not a purpose living life whatever what time was he doing [Music] [Music] around here you can literally feel the atmosphere an immoral atmosphere and this woman entered the room jesus was sick yesterday and when she came the moment she reached where jesus when jesus was sitting there yesterday the woman came that they knew is there could be many perspectives the disciples could have one perspective this woman is lasting why is she crying oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] life [Applause] for his life maybe he would have been taken by this woman but the good news is jesus yes he was living a purpose [Music] don't mind about others [Music] cannot be seen by them i don't come to church because i'm perfect i am the church i come to church for him to make me pastor and took it [Music] hallelujah [Music] you cannot come to church and your mind is somewhere else am i preaching to someone hallelujah then god told them moses i gotta say that a lot of helpless how long will you refuse to hammer yourself before me oh no no let my people go the cabin that was the purpose of moses [Music] his purpose was not hero to raise god
