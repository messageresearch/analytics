[40:59] home don't say brother I'm not persed at
[41:05] home but talk
[41:07] persecution at your workplace you are
[41:10] persecuted at home you are persecuted
[41:13] whenever you are you are
[41:14] persecuted for Christ's
[41:17] sake amen you do good is
[41:22] misinterpreted blessed be the name of
[41:24] the Lord and I believe we are living in
[41:27] the
[41:28] time where this thing is
[41:31] happening but the Bible tells us the
[41:34] Bible gives us
[41:37] consolation that even though we are
[41:40] persecuted but we are not
[41:43] forsaken blessed be the name of the Lord
[41:46] that is where our confidence
[41:49] is the
[41:51] difference
[41:53] down but not
[41:56] destroy of man like
[41:59] Paul is talking about being cast
[42:04] down many time we are cast
[42:08] down many time we are
[42:11] challenged blessed be the name of the
[42:13] Lord but one thing we assur of that we
[42:18] are not
[42:19] destroyed because we have the seed of
[42:22] God in
[42:23] us that's why the Bible tells us
[42:27] man fall seven
[42:29] times and he rise
[42:33] again because though we are cast
[42:36] down we cannot be
[42:39] destroyed we cannot be finished because
[42:42] we have the Gen of God in us we have
[42:45] God's DNA in us and God cannot be
[42:50] destroyed the Alpha and Omega he the
[42:54] beginning and the
[42:55] ending end from the beginning is the one
[42:59] leading us is the one leading the
[43:02] battle blessed be the name of the
[43:05] Lord
[43:06] amen always bearing about in the
[43:13] body the dying of the Lord
[43:16] Jesus that the life also of
[43:20] Jesus must be manifest in our body
[43:27] blessed be the name of the
[43:29] Lord for the Bible tells us that kind
[43:35] minded is anity to
[43:38] God but it tell that when we walk in the
[43:41] spirit we shall not fulfill the lust of
[43:44] the
[43:46] flesh blessed be the name of the Lord
[43:49] and here Apostle Paul is telling us that
[43:52] for we which are always delivered unto
[43:55] death for Jesus
[44:02] that life also of Jesus might be
[44:05] manifested in our moral
[44:12] body not spiritual body
[44:15] now but the Life of Christ must be
[44:17] manifested in our m
[44:21] b that's why you have a mandate to walk
[44:24] in the spirit
[44:27] blessed be the name of the Lord and this

[47:13] God the Jehovah of the Old
[47:16] Testament is on our side blessed be the
[47:20] name of the Lord that's why though we

[47:49] side you not be
[47:51] here when you look
[47:54] back and you see things that God brought

[1:07:04] we are talking of Christ we are not
[1:07:07] talking about Jesus a little Jesus in
[1:07:09] the
[1:07:10] M but we are speaking about the Holy

[1:07:18] when he the Holy Ghost is come he will
[1:07:21] lead you into all the truth and today

[1:15:49] sinner I'm not this or that I have tried
[1:15:53] my best
[1:15:57] but when you look at it from spiritual
[1:16:01] perspective you would say that all
[1:16:03] things work together for
[1:16:06] good blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:16:09] when they cast it where they cast in the
[1:16:12] burning
[1:16:13] furnace he was already there
[1:16:17] waiting blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:16:20] and
[1:16:22] surprisingly even the king
[1:16:28] the fire is the end of these
[1:16:32] guys he was expecting some spal
[1:16:37] something praise the Lord was not yet
[1:16:42] over and he was the first man to
[1:16:46] testify we cast three mens in the
[1:16:49] fire are you seeing what I'm
[1:16:52] seeing we c three men
[1:16:57] s but I'm seeing the fourth
[1:16:59] man the man got the
[1:17:02] Revelation and said the Fourth
[1:17:05] Man look like the son of
[1:17:09] man blessed with the name of the
[1:17:12] Lord amen God was working it
[1:17:17] out that same God is here tonight that
[1:17:22] same God is alive today
[1:17:26] amen and is telling the enemy do
[1:17:29] whatever you want it's not yet over but
[1:17:33] remember even the devil knows God cannot
[1:17:36] Just Surrender brother M to the devil
[1:17:39] without without a
[1:17:42] backup the other time I told you that
[1:17:45] God has his hard
[1:17:48] disk that
[1:17:50] disc blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:17:53] before the foundation of the world
[1:17:56] before he created the star before he
[1:17:59] became even God when he was still
[1:18:02] Elohim amen when he was still staying
[1:18:08] alone he got those
[1:18:11] people slay the
[1:18:13] lamp wrote their
[1:18:16] name in that hard
[1:18:19] dis in
[1:18:21] glory that is so safe
[1:18:25] is so
[1:18:26] secured that nobody can blot your name
[1:18:30] out of
[1:18:32] it and the devil knows those
[1:18:36] people because they are
[1:18:40] marked praise be to God even when he's
[1:18:43] attacking he
[1:18:44] knows even when you have access in your
[1:18:47] home he
[1:18:48] knows that any time I'm being I'm going
[1:18:51] to be kicked out of this
[1:18:53] house any I'm going to be kicked out of
[1:18:56] this
[1:18:57] place because this is a special
[1:19:00] person these are the pest of the
[1:19:04] Lord blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:19:07] those are the people the Bible says in
[1:19:10] Daniel that those who will know their
[1:19:12] God they shall do
[1:19:15] explod why because before the foundation
[1:19:18] of the
[1:19:19] world they were
[1:19:21] somewhere so they bypass their theophany
[1:19:25] but inside their
[1:19:27] soul something tells them that they are
[1:19:31] not of this world that's why those
[1:19:34] people they dress like children of God
[1:19:37] they walk like children of God they talk
[1:19:40] like children of God they worship like
[1:19:42] children of
[1:19:43] God and they dance like children of God
[1:19:50] [Music]
[1:20:02] those one they come from another
[1:20:05] kingdom and that is the kingdom of
[1:20:08] darkness it is f the
[1:20:11] Kingdom full of lust full of
[1:20:14] filthiness full of
[1:20:16] dreadlocks full of
[1:20:18] mear full of smoking full of
[1:20:23] prostitution that's why that's why when
[1:20:25] they
[1:20:26] come they have to express the kingdom
[1:20:29] where they come
[1:20:32] from blessed be the name of the Lord but
[1:20:35] there's a group of
[1:20:37] people whom the Bible
[1:20:39] says
[1:20:41] hallelujah they were living in chip
[1:20:45] skins they were living in
[1:20:47] tents they're moving from place to
[1:20:50] place they were not

[1:20:55] kingdom
[1:20:57] SP they knew that there is a
[1:20:59] kingdom not this Earthly Kingdom not
[1:21:03] this a city they were not looking for
[1:21:06] New York they were not looking for
[1:21:08] campala they not looking for Nairobi

[1:21:38] people even when they are worshiping
[1:21:41] God hallelujah they worship like
[1:21:45] Angels they worship even much better
[1:21:47] than
[1:21:49] Angels because the poet
[1:21:52] say we shall sing the we shall tell the
[1:21:56] story how we
[1:21:58] overcome we shall sing a song which the
[1:22:02] devil which even the angels will not be

[1:24:52] dream and another one interpreted for
[1:24:55] the
[1:24:57] brother and the man of God was there

[1:26:16] way you will know that this is not the
[1:26:18] end of
[1:26:20] me we are not ordinary people
[1:26:24] we are supernatural
[1:26:27] being and when we walk in the
[1:26:30] spirit that's when we shall know
[1:26:33] that Peter was arrested like any other
[1:26:36] man he was cast in
[1:26:39] prison he was just a normal
[1:26:41] man he was a normal brother he was
[1:26:45] scared like any of us here would
[1:26:48] be he was taken in
[1:26:50] jail he had just had what had happened
[1:26:53] to Stephan

[1:28:03] Shing this that is the spirit of
[1:28:08] Christians that is Christian
[1:28:10] heart bearing one another's
[1:28:14] buring and when they began to
[1:28:17] pray
[1:28:19] Hallelujah the devil was
[1:28:22] Wasing amen the devil knows the promise
[1:28:26] so
[1:28:28] well even when Christ told Peter that
[1:28:31] Peter uh Upon This Rock I'll build my
[1:28:36] [Music]
[1:28:38] church the devil was there listening was
[1:28:41] like what where is the
[1:28:45] rock of course the devil knows does not
[1:28:48] know
[1:28:50] Revelation there not this man is been
[1:28:53] standing on the side
[1:28:57] is not even a Son of
[1:29:00] God that's how God
[1:29:03] works someone sees brother
[1:29:06] en I have this brother
[1:29:12] also touch him you see how things will
[1:29:16] turn upside
[1:29:18] down blessed be the name of the
[1:29:21] Lord so when they began to pray
[1:29:25] the angel said no
[1:29:26] no and when Peter was there maybe was he
[1:29:30] was looking at his
[1:29:34] watch going to be me at around
[1:29:38] two let me write my because Peter had
[1:29:42] family praise be to God but the angel
[1:29:46] said not
[1:29:48] yet is not yet
[1:29:50] over amen say there some is praying and
[1:29:56] that's why I've come I'm getting out of
[1:29:58] this pron and I'm here to tell you no
[1:30:02] matter the prison you are in the same
[1:30:04] Angel of the Lord who liated Peter is
[1:30:07] still moving in the Church of the Living
[1:30:09] God to liberate you out of your
[1:30:13] prison praise be to God when Paul and
[1:30:16] silus were in
[1:30:18] prison Hallelujah Paul knew very
[1:30:22] well not just end like
[1:30:25] this no sir Hallelujah he
[1:30:30] remember he went to the constitution of
[1:30:35] Glory article 47
[1:30:39] B amen and then when he was when he
[1:30:43] opened article 37
[1:30:45] B he remembered in
[1:30:48] Psalms praise the
[1:30:50] Lord amen all you righteous
[1:30:54] sing praise those
[1:30:57] upright amen we started to praise the
[1:31:00] Lord s us joined him they started
[1:31:04] singing they started praising maybe they
[1:31:08] started when things were hard but they
[1:31:11] pressed on because Paul knew that right
[1:31:14] from the days of John the Baptist until
[1:31:17] today this Kingdom saath violence they
[1:31:20] put violence is in Praise Is In Worship
[1:31:25] and guess
[1:31:31] what and then they were trembling around
[1:31:34] you hear
[1:31:35] that sure I feel
[1:31:40] good
[1:31:42] amen then they kept on
[1:31:45] praising then again the Shing came out I
[1:31:48] said
[1:31:49] Paul let us read another article here oh
[1:31:53] yes
[1:31:54] he here they kept on praising and
[1:31:57] praising and all of a sudden shame fell
[1:32:01] off their hands their FS were
[1:32:04] loose blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:32:08] and maybe the PRI on God was
[1:32:10] dreaming he was being disturbed in the
[1:32:13] dream about these men who were in
[1:32:16] prison Hallelujah not all cops are
[1:32:22] corrupt not all
[1:32:24] Spirit security
[1:32:27] Personnel not all of them sideline with
[1:32:31] evil some of those men they are
[1:32:34] innocent some are righteous men and
[1:32:38] maybe this man knew these men were
[1:32:41] innocent they just preaching the gospel
[1:32:44] they want to kill them for
[1:32:46] nothing blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:32:49] but in glory something was
[1:32:51] happening God knew that unless Paul and
[1:32:55] cus if they had not taken to the
[1:32:58] prison this man would not hear his
[1:33:01] name so God took them to prison for that
[1:33:07] family Hallelujah and Paul knew this man
[1:33:11] was filled with the Holy
[1:33:13] Ghost and you know that when you walk in
[1:33:15] the
[1:33:16] spirit shall not for the last of Paul
[1:33:20] was in the spirit he say if I'm to do
[1:33:22] anything I will do it in the spirit
[1:33:26] he was in the spirit and maybe him being
[1:33:29] the prophet of the
[1:33:31] Gentiles something in his heart told him
[1:33:35] that we are here for a purpose we are
[1:33:37] here for a reason but let us just wait
[1:33:40] upon God s fear not always we are not
[1:33:45] equivalent in
[1:33:48] faith we have different measures of
[1:33:52] faith and the reason us words like that
[1:33:55] this one of a stronger
[1:33:57] Faith would have to encourage the one
[1:33:59] with a weaker
[1:34:00] faith I believe Paul's Faith was much
[1:34:04] much higher than C's
[1:34:06] faith I said my brother don't you worry
[1:34:10] we are here for a reason blessed be the
[1:34:13] name of the Lord Paul's
[1:34:15] the I believe was detecting another
[1:34:18] theop
[1:34:19] within there was a deep calling within
[1:34:22] the
[1:34:24] I calling within the
[1:34:26] prison and when this man was maybe
[1:34:30] sleeping maybe a do
[1:34:32] do and then he had the
[1:34:35] earthquake and when he woke up the G the
[1:34:38] doors were
[1:34:40] open I was like
[1:34:45] what have gone away so he pulled his
[1:34:48] SW he wanted to hurt
[1:34:50] himself said no sir we are here do not
[1:34:54] harm
[1:34:55] yourself and God say that is
[1:35:01] it blessed be the name of and the man
[1:35:04] asked him a very nice
[1:35:06] question to be
[1:35:08] sa and Paul
[1:35:11] say believe Jesus
[1:35:14] Christ your house be
[1:35:18] saved and the job was done and the men
[1:35:21] were released out of the pron
