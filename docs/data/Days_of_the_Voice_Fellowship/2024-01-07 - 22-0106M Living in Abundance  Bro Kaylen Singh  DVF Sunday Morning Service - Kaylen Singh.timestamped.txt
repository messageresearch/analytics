[1:40:24] 2011 was my first year to leave the
[1:40:28] country for a far distance I had been in
[1:40:30] some other countries butab was quite
[1:40:37] far and I spent there more than a
[1:40:42] month you know on missionary
[1:40:47] work I remember that was actually my
[1:40:50] year
[1:40:51] of full consecration into missionary
[1:40:56] work I remember on that
[1:40:59] trip uh we were in a place I do not
[1:41:01] remember the name
[1:41:03] now maybe I don't know whether brother K
[1:41:06] was
[1:41:07] there that place was built by the
[1:41:12] missionaries and many years
[1:41:17] ago now use
[1:41:19] it
[1:41:22] church when I was preaching
[1:41:24] there I know I I was always listening
[1:41:27] toam say the angel of the Lord is
[1:41:33] here that is usually what it is on
[1:41:37] the uh but that day I experienced it for
[1:41:41] my first
[1:41:44] time while I was
[1:41:47] [Music]
[1:41:49] preaching in I did not know what was
[1:41:51] going

[1:42:00] brush and so I Fel I thought maybe it
[1:42:02] was just in my mind

[1:42:09] again I felt something like like you
[1:42:12] know like touching me on my

[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:55:12] [Music]
[1:55:18] for
[1:55:29] [Music]
[1:55:40] amen may the Lord add His blessings to
[1:55:42] the reading of the
[1:55:44] word you can have your seats this
[1:55:47] morning amen I trust happy to be in the
[1:55:50] house of the
[1:55:52] Lord I pray that the Lord would bless
[1:55:54] the word this
[1:55:57] morning amen and again forgive us for
[1:56:00] being a bit
[1:56:02] late but we pray that God would speak to
[1:56:04] our
[1:56:05] hearts and speak to our lives
[1:56:08] amen so I want to speak to you this
[1:56:11] morning on a thought that the lord has
[1:56:13] laid on my
[1:56:15] heart and I'll title it living in the
[1:56:18] Overflow living in the
[1:56:22] abundance living in the
[1:56:25] abundance amen the scripture that we
[1:56:29] read is a deep
[1:56:32] subject and you can preach a whole
[1:56:35] series on
[1:56:37] it but this
[1:56:39] morning I just want to focus on the
[1:56:44] results of the
[1:56:48] restoration and verse 24
[1:56:51] says that the floor shall be full of
[1:56:54] [Music]
[1:56:56] Wheat and the fat shall overflow with
[1:56:58] wine and
[1:57:01] oil now the prophet of God would tell
[1:57:04] us that this was an end time
[1:57:08] prophecy it is something that's going to
[1:57:10] deal with our
[1:57:12] day in the third
[1:57:16] seal brother Bram would
[1:57:18] say now the same thing today when it
[1:57:20] rises on the
[1:57:23] scene now God said in Malachi
[1:57:26] 4 that he would send a message in the
[1:57:29] last
[1:57:30] days that would
[1:57:34] restore Joel said I will restore the
[1:57:38] years everything that Rome eat
[1:57:41] up everything the Methodist eat
[1:57:44] up everything the Baptist eat
[1:57:48] up that original Pentecostal
[1:57:52] Branch God said I will restore in the
[1:57:54] last
[1:57:56] days that's right and he can sense we
[1:58:00] are living in that
[1:58:01] season we are living in the hour of the
[1:58:05] complete
[1:58:07] restoration I trust you believe that
[1:58:09] this morning and when there's a
[1:58:12] restoration the bible promises that our
[1:58:16] flaws will be full of
[1:58:18] wheat
[1:58:20] and there will be an
[1:58:22] overflow with wine and
[1:58:25] oil and that word
[1:58:28] overflow means to give an
[1:58:31] abundance to give an
[1:58:34] abundance so God is making a
[1:58:37] promise to the church in the end time we
[1:58:41] are not going to be
[1:58:43] Beggars is there somebody with me God is
[1:58:46] giving a promise to the church in the
[1:58:49] end time that we don't have to settle
[1:58:52] for
[1:58:54] crumbs but there's going to be an
[1:58:58] outpouring of
[1:58:59] God a manifestation of
[1:59:02] God God is going to
[1:59:05] release an abundance upon his
[1:59:08] people I trust you believe that this
[1:59:11] morning we are not living in the time
[1:59:14] where we need to beg we are not living
[1:59:17] in the time where we need to
[1:59:20] borrow we are not living in a time where
[1:59:23] we need to keep
[1:59:25] asking but we living in a time where the
[1:59:28] Bible says before we ask he already
[1:59:33] knows before we speak he will answer we
[1:59:38] are living in that hour we are living in
[1:59:40] that time I trust you believe that
[1:59:43] church TR you can accept that we are
[1:59:47] special people we are people
[1:59:51] anointed we are people
[1:59:53] called We Are People
[1:59:56] chosen for this hour for this moment for
[2:00:00] this time we are the Bride of Jesus
[2:00:05] Christ we are the
[2:00:07] queen of heaven and God is entrusting
[2:00:13] us with the fully revealed
[2:00:16] word I hope you believe that
[2:00:19] we don't have a partial
[2:00:21] truth we don't have a portion of
[2:00:25] truth but this is the hour of
[2:00:29] abundance this is the hour of
[2:00:33] restoration what we read of in the
[2:00:36] Bible should be here
[2:00:38] today and it shouldn't be a special
[2:00:44] event I want to say this with
[2:00:46] reverence humility and
[2:00:50] respect the
[2:00:52] supernatural should be a daily
[2:00:56] occurrence in the lives of the Bride of
[2:00:59] Jesus
[2:01:00] Christ it shouldn't be
[2:01:02] something that shocks us when we hear
[2:01:06] about the angel of the
[2:01:08] Lord it shouldn't be something that
[2:01:11] surprises us when we hear about
[2:01:15] miracles when we hear about
[2:01:17] healings when we hear about
[2:01:19] Deliverance it shouldn't be
[2:01:22] surprising when we hear about
[2:01:25] Revival in the lives of the
[2:01:27] people it should be something we should
[2:01:31] be
[2:01:32] expecting it should be something that we
[2:01:35] should be looking
[2:01:37] for I hope you're with Meen this is not
[2:01:41] something that is coming down the
[2:01:44] line This is not something in the future
[2:01:49] but if you can believe that God has
[2:01:52] already sent a
[2:01:55] Prophet The Prophet's work is
[2:01:58] done the prophet's work is
[2:02:01] done his work was the work of
[2:02:06] restoration to bring us back to the
[2:02:09] Bible the way Paul had it the way Peter
[2:02:13] had it the way the book of Acts had it
[2:02:17] so God had to bring a message to take us
[2:02:22] back to the Bible then there must be a
[2:02:26] people who will now be the
[2:02:29] people of the
[2:02:31] Bible there must be a people who are a
[2:02:36] continuation of the book of
[2:02:39] Acts listen friends we are not living in
[2:02:42] the time where God is giving a
[2:02:47] message we are not living in the time
[2:02:51] where God is giving a message the
[2:02:54] message has been
[2:02:55] given the message has been
[2:02:58] delivered the message has been given it
[2:03:02] is time that John takes the
[2:03:05] book and eats the book and becomes the
[2:03:10] book now it is John's time to prophesy
[2:03:16] again Hallelujah
[2:03:20] Hallelujah we may not be the givers of
[2:03:22] the
[2:03:24] message because it's been
[2:03:26] given but we have been
[2:03:29] entrusted to take the given
[2:03:34] message and give it to the
[2:03:38] people hallelujah I hope you with me do
[2:03:42] you love the Lord amen there's a promise
[2:03:45] of
[2:03:46] restoration a promise of abundance

[2:03:53] of
[2:03:54] [Music]
[2:03:55] wheat in the harest time brother Bram
[2:03:58] would
[2:04:00] say notice now he's seen the perfect
[2:04:03] one he struck him he M
[2:04:08] him Isaiah said he was wounded for our
[2:04:13] transgressions he was bruised for our
[2:04:17] iniquity

[2:04:27] bread that every man shall live
[2:04:31] by that's Jesus
[2:04:33] Christ he's the wheat of God's
[2:04:37] word that could be
[2:04:40] ground and put into four gospels and 66
[2:04:47] books and Men shall live by
[2:04:51] that and that
[2:04:54] alone every word of
[2:04:56] it amen the floor shall be full of
[2:05:00] [Music]

[2:05:04] bread and that bread is Jesus
[2:05:08] Christ that bread is Jesus Christ and
[2:05:11] God has ground
[2:05:13] him put him into the four gospels and in
[2:05:18] the 6
[2:05:19] books and Men shall live by
[2:05:22] that amen we are to feed on the body
[2:05:29] word the son of man do you believe that
[2:05:33] listen friends in this hour we don't
[2:05:37] have a partial
[2:05:40] revelation we don't just have a
[2:05:42] peace we have the fully revealed
[2:05:47] word is not here with the
[2:05:52] Shar but at the opening of The Seven
[2:05:56] Seals Revelation

[2:06:01] word is to be born into manifestation
[2:06:06] again and Vindicated by the spirit of
[2:06:09] God in the full
[2:06:12] strength as he was when he was here on
[2:06:15] Earth amen Hebrews 138
[2:06:20] said Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[2:06:22] today and
[2:06:26] forever Luke
[2:06:28] 17:30 Jesus said in the last
[2:06:31] days as it was in the days of
[2:06:34] Sodom the son of man will be revealing
[2:06:37] himself
[2:06:38] again it will be the same
[2:06:41] thing are we living in that day has the

[2:06:59] wheat Jesus is that
[2:07:02] wheat and the bride is
[2:07:05] feeding on that body
[2:07:07] word of the son of man we are not
[2:07:11] feeding on denominational
[2:07:14] teachings we are not feeding on manmade
[2:07:19] theories we not feeding on some men's
[2:07:24] teachings we are actually feeding on the
[2:07:28] very mind of
[2:07:31] God hallelujah we are feeding on the
[2:07:35] very mind of
[2:07:37] God and his mind has been expressed in
[2:07:41] this
[2:07:42] hour do you believe that we're not
[2:07:45] waiting for any more
[2:07:47] revelation
[2:07:50] huah we are not waiting for any more

[2:07:58] angel when he shall begin to
[2:08:01] sound the mystery of God is
[2:08:05] finished are we living in that day amen
[2:08:09] I believe the church is called the days
[2:08:11] of the
[2:08:13] voice so the name of the
[2:08:15] church is a declaration
[2:08:19] that we are living in the
[2:08:20] hour when the days of the
[2:08:23] voice is being made known on the
[2:08:26] earth do you believe that church amen we
[2:08:30] have an open

[2:08:35] mighty Angel
[2:08:37] descended the book was
[2:08:40] open is that right the book was
[2:08:44] open now I can tell you no man can close
[2:08:48] close
[2:08:49] it no man can seal
[2:08:52] it no man can hide it because God opened
[2:08:56] it and if God opened it no man can shut
[2:09:01] it if God revealed it no man can take it
[2:09:06] away no man can explain it
[2:09:09] away when God has made it known to
[2:09:14] you this is the
[2:09:16] truth if somebody explain
[2:09:19] it someone can talk you out of
[2:09:23] it somebody talks you into it someone
[2:09:27] can talk you out of it but if God has
[2:09:30] revealed it if God has made it
[2:09:35] known to you as an

[2:10:03] up I don't care which Man shows up that
[2:10:08] claims to be the leader of the
[2:10:11] Bride when God has revealed it to

[2:11:33] bush when you met the holy ghost that
[2:11:37] Pillar of Fire is no longer a
[2:11:41] picture that we have in the
[2:11:44] churches over a prophet's
[2:11:46] head that pillar of fire has
[2:11:50] moved has moved you see friends we're
[2:11:55] not here to build a
[2:11:57] shrine we are not here to build a

[2:12:05] moved when the children of Israel
[2:12:09] moved it was a pillar of fire would lead
[2:12:12] them by night and A Cloud by
[2:12:16] day it was the same God in different
[2:12:21] manifestation but he was not one known
[2:12:24] to stand
[2:12:27] still so you can't put
[2:12:30] him on a

[2:13:31] he's moving do you believe that is here
[2:13:35] today that Pillar of Fire is the
[2:13:43] word in the beginning what the word the
[2:13:47] word was with God the Word was God that
[2:13:51] word was made flesh did you notice the
[2:13:55] word according to the
[2:13:57] Bible is not a
[2:14:01] book the word according to the
[2:14:04] Bible is a
[2:14:08] person the word according to the
[2:14:11] Bible is a
[2:14:13] person that person is Jesus Christ
[2:14:20] Hallelujah that's why I said somewhere
[2:14:23] else you can bur this
[2:14:26] Bible you can't bur the
[2:14:29] word you can destroy this
[2:14:31] Bible but you can't destroy the word you
[2:14:35] can burn the

[2:14:40] can burn the
[2:14:41] books but you can't burn the
[2:14:44] word because the word is a p
[2:14:49] the word is a person this message that
[2:14:53] we've been introduced to is not a
[2:14:58] teaching this message is not a
[2:15:02] Doctrine this message is a
[2:15:06] person this message is a person his name
[2:15:11] is Jesus
[2:15:14] Christ you believe that that's why
[2:15:18] brother Brandon would tell us in one
[2:15:20] place in the rising of the sun he says
[2:15:24] Jesus Christ is those
[2:15:27] seals so what is those seals then it's
[2:15:31] revealing Jesus
[2:15:33] Christ that's why God opened the
[2:15:37] book so that you can know
[2:15:40] Jesus the way Paul knew
[2:15:43] Jesus you can know Jesus the way Peter
[2:15:47] knew
[2:15:48] Jesus listen brother when Peter and
[2:15:52] John at the gate called

[3:15:08] for me to have for us to have a meeting
[3:15:10] with a
[3:15:11] v
[3:15:14] but when I saw he sent me the whole
[3:15:17] that's the mistake you did you sent me
[3:15:18] the whole
[3:15:22] program and then when I looked at the
[3:15:24] program I saw that he was going to

[3:16:38] back Apostle Paul said if I power unto

[3:16:59] it but we want to show our
[3:17:03] love we believe in that those are small
[3:17:07] amens do we believe in
[3:17:08] that amen that's 100% of you so that's
[3:17:12] good we'll sing this song as we give our
[3:17:14] offering our love

[3:17:20] not ask you to sit because I know you
[3:17:21] were sitting for a long time so it's
[3:17:24] okay uh so we are going to sing this
[3:17:26] song while we are standing and while we
[3:17:29] give I uh we did not have a chance to
[3:17:32] give the announcement so I'll just give
[3:17:33] it
[3:17:37] now the deacons have reminded
[3:17:40] me because they said it sounded as if I
[3:17:43] said each family is supposed to
[3:17:45] contribute
[3:17:52] 100,000 no each member of the
[3:17:57] church is supposed to contribute
[3:18:01] 100,000 if the Lord has provided to
[3:18:05] you you can
[3:18:08] sacrifice please do that if you are a
[3:18:12] man and his
[3:18:13] wife contribute
[3:18:16] 200,000 if you
[3:18:18] can there are sever who have already
[3:18:20] done
[3:18:21] that and God bless you so much and if
[3:18:25] you haven't yet done it I'm requesting
[3:18:28] you to please do

[3:18:52] amount you know we ask the young people
[3:18:54] to contribute 50,000
