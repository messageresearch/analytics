[48:59] tonight quite a subject that I would
[49:01] like to undertake

[49:11] on this what
[49:13] we lord I pray that you bless each
[49:17] one give

[49:37] [Music]
[49:39] of and that is good and
[49:45] acceptable we ask your blessings upon
[49:47] the
[49:49] scripture as we read it
[49:51] tonight that it will be a
[49:54] blessing in Jesus name
[49:57] amen amen amen turn to your neighbor
[50:00] tell them you welcome in the house of
[50:01] the
[50:05] Lord amen
[50:11] amen is the Lord good has the Lord been
[50:16] good the subject I want to deal with
[50:20] today I'm happy to see several mothers
[50:23] who have sacrificed to be here
[50:27] know whenever it
[50:30] rains some of the people that cannot
[50:32] make it
[50:35] mothers so but when we see them coming
[50:37] with
[50:38] children I know
[50:41] a and certainly God will bless you
[50:45] for all those of you who have made
[50:48] it God bless
[50:50] you and now there are those who shall
[50:52] join us by the way of the internet
[50:56] especially those who are
[50:58] far but the subject I want to deal with
[51:02] today I have been asked by several by
[51:06] many on several
[51:08] occasions for the past one
[51:13] year regarding hair long hair of women
[51:16] and how should it be kept
[51:24] and so today by God's I want to deal
[51:27] with
[51:29] that so I'm requesting that you give me
[51:31] your undivided
[51:34] attention I would normally preach such a
[51:36] lengthy subject on
[51:41] Sunday so um being that's a little bit
[51:46] doctrinal so uh where most people are
[51:51] here but thank God for the internet that
[51:54] we stream and these services are
[51:55] recorded
[52:00] so someone who is not here can watch it
[52:05] later amen amen and so um also uh there
[52:10] are several in
[52:13] carja that have asked me to to also deal
[52:17] with this
[52:20] subject uh it's quite a an issue there
[52:26] I understand even there are some who
[52:28] have either dis fellowed been dis
[52:33] fellowed because of this
[52:35] issue so it might be so simple for
[52:39] you if you already know just uh just
[52:42] enjoy the
[52:45] word and if you don't know
[52:48] learn and if you knew a little you can
[52:50] add your
[52:52] understand but it is good for us to know
[52:55] what we believe
[52:57] is that amen and really what we believe
[53:00] is what our Prophet told
[53:03] us
[53:05] amen uh so we we shall go to the book of
[53:08] First Corinthians
[53:12] 11 I've incidentally been asked as well
[53:15] to minister to evening
[53:21] light by the way I congratulate evening
[53:23] light right Tabernacle for the election
[53:26] their new associate
[53:33] pastor brother job gav
[53:37] understand so we congratulate
[53:40] him and pray for God His
[53:43] blessings amen that was for evening
[53:47] light amen we just go to First
[53:49] Corinthians chapter
[53:51] 11 so I'm also ministering for the
[53:55] Saints on Zoom I'm also ministering ing
[53:56] this uh here at at um uh
[54:03] dvf so if I if it is lengthy I'll
[54:07] continue and then maybe the brothers
[54:09] will will divide it into
[54:15] two and then the other part can be
[54:17] played
[54:19] later so just want us to be attentive
[54:22] because this is a bit
[54:25] doctrinal I said I'm really not going to
[54:27] give my opinions or ideas but I'm going
[54:29] to read and and give you the
[54:37] message can we say Amen to
[54:39] that chapter 11: we just read only one
[54:46] verse but if a woman have long hair it
[54:49] is a glory to her for her hair is given
[54:52] her for a covering
[54:56] [Music]
[54:59] Corinthians
[55:12] 11: amen you may be
[55:16] seated I'm going to speak to you this
[55:18] evening on the subject of long hair a
[55:21] woman is ornament and Glory
[55:31] so I'm requesting your undivided
[55:34] attention this is
[55:36] a a well you know a subject that is I
[55:41] don't know which word to use but it is
[55:43] debated on a
[55:50] lot even in the message we're talking
[55:52] about in the reals of the message of the
[55:57] so this debated on
[56:01] much each
[56:04] almost Pastor has his own take on
[56:09] it and um each Church looks at it
[56:15] differently but as I understand before I
[56:17] even get into
[56:19] it I'd like to say that I do not believe
[56:23] that we we will make it to the Rapture
[56:25] on the basis of work
[56:30] I believe God is going to best on the on
[56:34] our
[56:38] faith and so if long hair for women or
[56:41] or hair inself as a teaching if if it's
[56:44] part of the
[56:48] word then it is the
[56:52] word our faith in the word matters
[56:57] how we approach it how we believe it and
[57:01] so I'm not going to teach a bunch of
[57:02] works this
[57:04] evening I'm just going to touch a little
[57:06] bit on a part of the
[57:10] word which I believe is as important as
[57:13] the rest of the
[57:15] world if you are found wanting in one
[57:18] area or the
[57:20] other just correct yourself and let's go
[57:23] on as Christians
[57:26] amen and if you fine then that's glory
[57:28] to
[57:30] God long hair a woman is ornament and
[57:37] Glory so you see um in the amplifi that
[57:40] verse which I read in the Amplified says
[57:42] but if a woman has long
[57:48] hair it is her orament and
[57:53] Glory so if a woman has long hair
[57:56] that long hair is her orament and
[58:03] Glory I do not know what what the word
[58:06] ornament is in luganda but I think
[58:09] that's the right word is like a
[58:11] decoration yeah yes you see if a woman
[58:15] if a woman wants to be well
[58:20] decorated then surely hair must be a
[58:23] part of
[58:25] it the Bible says long
[58:28] hair is her
[58:31] hament and is her
[58:33] glory so you see if even if a woman
[58:36] really dresses so
[58:38] well but but her head is
[58:42] shabby you know or she doesn't have hair
[58:45] on her
[58:46] head she looks
[58:48] funny that's the truth is that right
[58:52] because you see hair is so much a part
[58:54] of a woman's
[58:56] uh
[59:02] adorning but we see it also has some
[59:04] spiritual connotations to
[59:08] it and that's what I want us to get into
[59:11] and and and everything about
[59:14] it so it is honor and
[59:18] glory for how long hair is given to her
[59:23] as a covering
[59:28] so now the Bible says it is her honor it
[59:30] is her glory and also it is her
[59:34] covering and then he says that she
[59:36] should not even pray in the same chapter
[59:38] she should not even pray or prophesy
[59:41] with an uncovered
[59:46] ha so ha is her
[59:49] covering all right so now we see here
[59:53] that the Bible says not just hair but it
[59:55] says long hair
[59:59] praise the name of the Lord and as we
[1:00:01] get into it let me just read I'm going
[1:00:03] to read a lot of quotes today so get
[1:00:05] ready and brothers if you can be able to
[1:00:08] get those quotes and put it on the
[1:00:09] screens for the people to follow I will
[1:00:11] appreciate that so I'm going to first of
[1:00:13] all read from questions and answers part
[1:00:16] four where the Prophet says why is it
[1:00:18] that we make so much of a big issue of
[1:00:20] women's
[1:00:21] dress somebody ask brother
[1:00:29] and he says oh I'm getting on this
[1:00:31] one big issue of women is dressing and
[1:00:33] cutting of
[1:00:36] hair nothing said about the hair of man
[1:00:39] or the way he
[1:00:42] dresses and then he answered this
[1:00:45] person and the only reason why I'm
[1:00:47] reading
[1:00:49] this because someone may may say what
[1:00:51] about us why are you not talking picking
[1:00:53] on men
[1:00:57] looks like you're talking so much about
[1:00:58] the the
[1:01:00] women and he says well sister I'm going
[1:01:03] to agree with you on one
[1:01:06] thing first place the bible say that a
[1:01:09] man should not have long
[1:01:12] hair and if he had long
[1:01:15] hair I would tell him just the same as I
[1:01:17] tell
[1:01:19] you he's wrong but most men lot lots of
[1:01:24] them like are like me he says
[1:01:27] not like me like The Prophet by
[1:01:30] the had a bold
[1:01:33] head but most men cut their
[1:01:37] hair you know they look like
[1:01:39] men now if they don't do it they would
[1:01:43] be not they would be told not to do
[1:01:46] so if they don't if they don't if they
[1:01:49] let their hair grow
[1:01:50] out they would be told not to do
[1:01:53] so we we would also tell them not to do
[1:01:57] so to leave their hair to grow out like
[1:02:00] a woman's
[1:02:02] hair they be Reed and if indeed we see
[1:02:04] some brother here not trying to let
[1:02:06] their hair grow out like a r or
[1:02:08] something we tell them no brother that
[1:02:10] is
[1:02:14] wrong so now I I'm going to bring this
[1:02:18] in a way of
[1:02:20] question I'll be dealing with one
[1:02:22] question after the other
[1:02:26] and the first one is what is long
[1:02:29] hair ask your neighbor what is long
[1:02:33] hair in the book of First Corinthians
[1:02:35] the same chapter we have read vers 3 11:
[1:02:40] 3 uh we are going to read up to verse
[1:02:43] six he says but I would have you know
[1:02:46] that the head of every man is Christ and
[1:02:49] the head of the woman is the man and the
[1:02:51] head of Christ is God
[1:03:01] every man praying or prophesying having
[1:03:03] his head covered this hor his
[1:03:12] head do you understand that part he says
[1:03:16] every man praying or prophesying having
[1:03:18] his head
[1:03:22] covered this horn has his head
[1:03:26] so he's not talking about a man dising
[1:03:28] his
[1:03:30] head he's talking about the man dising
[1:03:35] Christ because he say the head of every
[1:03:38] man is
[1:03:39] Christ and the head of every woman is
[1:03:41] the
[1:03:43] man so if a man covers his
[1:03:48] head dising
[1:03:51] Christ but every woman that prays or
[1:03:54] prophesies with her head
[1:04:00] uncovered now this is really where the
[1:04:03] whole thing
[1:04:05] begin many people have misunderstood
[1:04:07] this portion of
[1:04:09] scripture and I want us to understand it
[1:04:12] very well he says but every woman that
[1:04:15] prays all prophesies with her head
[1:04:22] uncover first of all correct that when
[1:04:24] he says prophesies is not saying
[1:04:29] preaching so if if a woman prays or
[1:04:35] prophesies with head
[1:04:39] uncover Dison her
[1:04:41] head if you understand it say Amen so
[1:04:45] now what does this
[1:04:47] mean so we have understood already that
[1:04:49] the head of every woman is the
[1:04:54] man so we see that if she if a woman has
[1:04:58] an uncovered
[1:05:01] hair she is dishonoring her
[1:05:05] husband but you see uh he continues on
[1:05:09] here to say just hold hold your thoughts
[1:05:11] together now for that is even all one as
[1:05:14] if she were
[1:05:18] shav so now he says if a woman prays or
[1:05:24] prophesies her head
[1:05:27] cover her
[1:05:29] head so what does that mean it means if
[1:05:33] a woman prays or
[1:05:36] prophesies certainly of course we pray
[1:05:38] every day we prophesy every day so if a
[1:05:41] woman in other words have an uncovered
[1:05:46] head dishonors her
[1:05:49] husband if she's not married she's
[1:05:52] dishonoring Christ are you following m
[1:05:57] I need to hear your
[1:05:59] amen okay now if you're following me
[1:06:01] here then it continues and says it is
[1:06:04] the same as if if she's not
[1:06:07] covered it is the same as if she was
[1:06:10] shoven or
[1:06:15] sh okay so what is the covering what
[1:06:18] does a covering
[1:06:20] mean the covering of course as we read
[1:06:23] in the beginning the covering is the
[1:06:28] hair so the woman is covering is the
[1:06:32] hair for the scripture says for her hair
[1:06:35] is given her for her
[1:06:39] covering so now if she doesn't have long
[1:06:44] hair she should shave everything
[1:06:50] off but he says if it is a
[1:06:54] shame for a woman to be shown or
[1:06:59] shaven let her be
[1:07:02] covered how will a woman be then
[1:07:06] covered a woman can only be covered with
[1:07:09] long
[1:07:12] hair right now he's not talking about a
[1:07:14] scarf or something that you
[1:07:17] put he's talking about hair long
[1:07:21] hair some says does it even nature
[1:07:23] itself teach you
[1:07:26] that if a man has long hair it is a
[1:07:30] shame but if a woman has long hair it is
[1:07:32] a
[1:07:34] glory so then what does long hair
[1:07:39] symbolize it symbolizes a
[1:07:42] covering so a covering is equals to long
[1:07:47] hair and as we get into the message here
[1:07:50] you'll find that long hair is actually
[1:07:52] talking about uncut hair
[1:08:00] says if a woman is not
[1:08:02] covered let be
[1:08:05] shet so what does it mean if a woman
[1:08:08] cuts her
[1:08:09] hair or trims it or reduces it and makes
[1:08:15] uses the word
[1:08:17] b it is the same as if she I mean if she
[1:08:21] does that then she should remove
[1:08:23] everything
[1:08:25] but because it is a shame for her to
[1:08:26] remove
[1:08:28] everything then let her be
[1:08:32] covered let her have long
[1:08:35] hair let her not touch her
[1:08:38] hair let her not trim her
[1:08:40] hair cutting your
[1:08:42] hair means you have an uncovered
[1:08:47] hair short hair does not mean trim um
[1:08:53] you know many people think that oh long
[1:08:54] hair means hair that goes all the way
[1:08:59] down but you see in Africa here we do
[1:09:01] not have any I do not know of any tribe
[1:09:03] that has hair all the way
[1:09:07] down Ethiopians have nice hair but still
[1:09:10] a little bit
[1:09:12] different so in other words long hair is
[1:09:16] uncut hair no matter how short it
[1:09:22] is it may be short this short or this
[1:09:26] this but as long as it is not
[1:09:30] trimed it is long
[1:09:33] hair but you see if you reduce it you
[1:09:37] know like mine is not long
[1:09:39] hair I may even have a bigger
[1:09:41] hair I can choose to have a bigger
[1:09:44] hair you see but as long as I keep
[1:09:46] trimming it and making it look
[1:09:50] tiny then it is not long hair so long
[1:09:54] hair is is uncut
[1:09:57] hair tell your neighbor long hair is
[1:09:59] uncut
[1:10:02] hair Hallelujah so uncovered to be
[1:10:05] uncovered is to Tre or cut your
[1:10:10] head to be shaven means to remove
[1:10:15] everything let's see what our Prophet
[1:10:17] says in questions answers on Hebrews
[1:10:21] part paragraph
[1:10:24] 757 now we just now we get just a minute
[1:10:27] and show you that the hair of the woman
[1:10:30] is her
[1:10:34] cover for that even he says is not in
[1:10:37] the scripture even all as one as if she
[1:10:38] was sheven that means if she's going to
[1:10:41] cut her hair then shave it all
[1:10:47] off you see for even for if the woman be
[1:10:51] not covered let her also be shown
[1:10:57] sh means
[1:10:59] sh but if it be a shame for a woman to
[1:11:02] be Shan or
[1:11:04] sheven let her be covered so in other
[1:11:08] words if if you if she doesn't want to
[1:11:10] be
[1:11:12] asame she shouldn't touch her
[1:11:14] hair she should let her let her hair
[1:11:17] grow
[1:11:18] out she should not Tre her hair
[1:11:22] Believers Christians don't trim their
[1:11:24] hair Believers women they don't trim
[1:11:27] their
[1:11:28] hair they don't cut their
[1:11:32] hair why because your hair is your
[1:11:36] covering but if you decide to cut it and
[1:11:40] do your gen
[1:11:43] cut then he says you should cut
[1:11:45] everything off completely shave itle
[1:11:51] SH now he says now we are getting right
[1:11:53] down to the question here you are asking
[1:11:57] all right now is it wrong for a lady to
[1:11:59] cut a
[1:12:01] hair according to the Bible now as I'm
[1:12:04] contining to read this quot for
[1:12:06] you I understand there are some
[1:12:09] people who think what brother bam says
[1:12:11] does not
[1:12:14] matter but I believe and in this church
[1:12:16] we believe what our Prophet says
[1:12:20] matters because he is the Fulfillment of
[1:12:24] Malachi 4
[1:12:26] he is the one that brought the message
[1:12:29] that is preparing us for the second
[1:12:30] coming of Jesus
[1:12:32] Christ he is our Authority in this
[1:12:36] day you know every preacher can have
[1:12:38] their
[1:12:39] opinion every church can have their
[1:12:42] opinion but you see Believers opinions
[1:12:45] is the message of the
[1:12:49] hour because you see brother bam pointed
[1:12:51] us to the
[1:12:53] Bible did not believe there is nothing
[1:12:56] butam say that is against the
[1:13:00] Bible every teaching he
[1:13:02] told was already in the Bible there is
[1:13:06] nothing new there is even new no new
[1:13:10] idea he doesn't when he talks about it
[1:13:13] he doesn't bring his
[1:13:15] opinion when he asks questions he
[1:13:17] doesn't bring his
[1:13:20] opinion he speaking what the word what
[1:13:23] the Bible says
[1:13:26] to the extent sometimes as I will read
[1:13:28] for you here some questions it says I
[1:13:29] don't
[1:13:32] know he said I don't know but I can give
[1:13:35] you my opinion but I don't know I will
[1:13:39] only take what the word
[1:13:41] says I will tell you the message of the
[1:13:45] hour amen is not a new message it's the
[1:13:49] message direct to the
[1:13:51] Bible if we want to understand what the
[1:13:54] Bible says
[1:13:55] we have to refer back again to the
[1:13:59] message I've heard people who claim they
[1:14:02] say oh no no no brother bam went wrong
[1:14:06] here according to who according to their
[1:14:09] own
[1:14:11] interpretation should we take your
[1:14:14] interpretation or we should take our
[1:14:16] prophet's interpretation of the
[1:14:19] Bible Amen in the Book of Amos
[1:14:23] 3:7 he said surely
[1:14:25] the Lord God will do nothing but he
[1:14:28] reveal his Secrets
[1:14:30] Hallelujah to his Ser us the
[1:14:33] prophets and we have a prophet in our
[1:14:36] generation it is his
[1:14:39] revelation of the word we
[1:14:42] believe it is what we take it is what we
[1:14:45] are standing
[1:14:47] on it is what has made us what we call
[1:14:50] message
[1:14:53] Believers what message do we
[1:14:55] believe we believe the message of
[1:14:57] William
[1:14:59] Bram which has taken us and pointed us
[1:15:01] to Christ
[1:15:04] Jesus anyone who
[1:15:07] interpretation is their own
[1:15:09] interpretation according to themselves
[1:15:12] and they are not
[1:15:14] Vindicated but our Prophet
[1:15:17] Hallelujah he is a Vindicated by the
[1:15:22] prophet God came down and himself with
[1:15:26] him and he said I am with this
[1:15:29] man and therefore we are on right
[1:15:32] ground when we take his
[1:15:35] interpretation of his word God is his
[1:15:38] own
[1:15:40] interpreter and how does he interpret it
[1:15:43] using His
[1:15:45] prophets praise the name of the Lord and
[1:15:48] so that should settle that for a
[1:15:51] Believer they claim to be a message
[1:15:53] believer
[1:15:55] they should believe what their messenger
[1:15:58] says I ought to have 100% Amen on
[1:16:03] that they claimed that they can correct
[1:16:06] brother bam on this and
[1:16:09] that and they were lost completely
[1:16:13] lost in their
[1:16:15] denominations before
[1:16:18] williamh but after he came now they were
[1:16:21] able to understand what the Bible was
[1:16:23] saying
[1:16:25] but now
[1:16:27] theying claiming they can correct the
[1:16:30] prophet you cannot correct a
[1:16:33] prophet a man who hears from
[1:16:36] God you cannot correct him because when
[1:16:40] he comes he comes with th say the
[1:16:44] Lord and everything he
[1:16:46] preached was he a man oh yes he was did
[1:16:50] he make mistakes oh yes he did but every
[1:16:54] mistake he
[1:16:56] God corrected him and he corrected it on
[1:17:01] T and so we have a perfect
[1:17:05] message a perfect message which does not
[1:17:09] need
[1:17:11] interpretation which does not need
[1:17:13] debate or father trying to
[1:17:18] explain what he said I believe it
[1:17:22] it and that's how every believer must
[1:17:27] that should be where we
[1:17:29] stand and we here as days of the voice
[1:17:31] Fellowship that is where we
[1:17:35] stand every message that is where we
[1:17:39] stand praise the name of the Lord and so
[1:17:43] it's an authority we are reading
[1:17:47] from not just some manmade
[1:17:50] idea so then he says I continue here
[1:17:56] for a for a
[1:17:58] man okay this is interesting now we we
[1:18:02] getting right down into the question
[1:18:04] here you are
[1:18:06] asking all right now is it wrong for a
[1:18:08] lady to cut a
[1:18:11] hair okay it's not a question this one
[1:18:14] is not a question it is a statement I'm
[1:18:16] sorry he says all right now it is
[1:18:19] wrong for a a lady to cut her
[1:18:23] hair according to the
[1:18:26] Now you listen right here and see if the
[1:18:28] Bible don't give a man a legal right to
[1:18:31] put away his wife if she cuts her
[1:18:39] hair see if this is right or
[1:18:42] not of course later on he explains and
[1:18:44] he says you see because her hair is
[1:18:46] given her for
[1:18:49] coverage but you see if she is
[1:18:52] uncovered she uh does not H her
[1:18:57] head and who is a woman
[1:19:00] head her husband so if she's
[1:19:04] dishonorable to her
[1:19:06] husband then that's why he says oh then
[1:19:09] the Bible gives a man right to put her
[1:19:14] away okay I will not explain that like I
[1:19:16] said we just believe what it
[1:19:19] says for a man in in in the Jewish old
[1:19:23] Jewish States
[1:19:25] you know when a man died a husband
[1:19:28] died a woman would remove her
[1:19:32] hair as a symbol that she's been
[1:19:37] Dishonored you know so you see but a
[1:19:40] woman dare not cut her
[1:19:42] hair when a husband is
[1:19:45] alive for a man indeed ought not to
[1:19:47] cover his
[1:19:49] head that is he says that is have long
[1:19:52] hair
[1:19:55] for as much as is the image and glory of
[1:19:59] God but the woman is the in the glory of
[1:20:03] the
[1:20:05] man did you ever think of that now I
[1:20:08] want to stop here because I want this to
[1:20:11] sock in real
[1:20:12] good and I remember I've seen tens of
[1:20:15] thousands of lovely
[1:20:19] women know them right now and plenty of
[1:20:22] them sitting in this church
[1:20:26] that has short
[1:20:27] hair that is
[1:20:29] Christians and while I lay it onto onto
[1:20:33] is not
[1:20:37] you it is the way you have been
[1:20:40] taught you you your preacher never told
[1:20:43] you
[1:20:45] this but if any of the women around this
[1:20:48] Tabernacle around this
[1:20:51] church then you are guilty
[1:20:54] he was speaking to crowds and many
[1:20:56] people all over and so today we can say
[1:21:00] there are many Christians all over the
[1:21:02] world that actually cut their
[1:21:05] hair personally I was from the Anglican
[1:21:08] Church they reawakened
[1:21:11] Revival and you know when a woman would
[1:21:14] believe the first thing they would do is
[1:21:15] to cut off her
[1:21:18] hair because they misinterpreted some
[1:21:20] part of the scripture in
[1:21:23] Isaiah where they where it say that oh
[1:21:25] where there was long hair I I'll leave
[1:21:27] the head
[1:21:31] Bal because he was talking about it was
[1:21:33] talking to the hty
[1:21:35] women that had left the Lord and
[1:21:38] forsaken the
[1:21:39] Lord was a sweet um beautiful smell or
[1:21:43] put a bad order and things like
[1:21:47] that so they thought oh yeah you see so
[1:21:49] God doesn't like hair he likes short
[1:21:52] hair but that's a missing interpretation
[1:21:55] of
[1:21:56] scripture and there are many Christian
[1:21:58] women
[1:21:59] today actually have short hair they cut
[1:22:03] the
[1:22:04] treatment and today we have even leaders
[1:22:07] in the government women who have short
[1:22:10] hair and you see it's becoming a
[1:22:13] trend you find them trimming it trimming
[1:22:15] itm it you know and they think it is
[1:22:19] fancy but you see that is the same as
[1:22:21] bobbing hair triming hair or cutting
[1:22:24] yeah
[1:22:25] same and the scripture says a woman
[1:22:28] should have long hair and cut
[1:22:32] hair but he says to you a
[1:22:35] Believer you know better you should not
[1:22:38] do what they doing because for you you
[1:22:41] are told you know you shouldn't touch
[1:22:43] your
[1:22:45] ha praise the name of the Lord and so I
[1:22:48] continue on here he says but if a woman
[1:22:50] has long
[1:22:52] hair is a glory to
[1:22:56] her he said glory to her if you have
[1:23:00] long hair say
[1:23:02] Amen now he says now what's he talking
[1:23:06] about a heart that you Catholic people
[1:23:09] wear in
[1:23:12] church he says no indeed are little
[1:23:15] covering over the top of your head with
[1:23:17] a
[1:23:20] handkerchief you know you know and then
[1:23:23] he says he's talking about your
[1:23:26] hair now and if a woman cuts off her
[1:23:30] hair she cuts off her
[1:23:33] glory and is not permitted to the alar
[1:23:36] to
[1:23:38] pray that means in the presence of
[1:23:41] God see just what it said here is it a
[1:23:45] common thing for a woman to go pray with
[1:23:47] a head and
[1:23:51] covered says well she's got well she got
[1:23:55] to cut her hair so let her be if she
[1:23:58] wants to cut her hair then let her be
[1:24:01] shaved of s I think we call it
[1:24:07] here and if she's going to be sh of
[1:24:13] sleek if she's ofle
[1:24:20] is say that's at this hor
[1:24:24] it's a dishonor to her
[1:24:27] head it's a shame for a woman to do that
[1:24:31] then say she ought to be
[1:24:33] covered now I'm just reading Paul's
[1:24:36] letter that's all up to you so you see
[1:24:40] he's saying I'm all I'm doing I'm giving
[1:24:42] you the word the rest is up to
[1:24:45] you questions part three
[1:24:49] says then if she says she must she has
[1:24:52] to cut it off
[1:24:56] then let her be
[1:24:57] shaved and said if she's um and if it's
[1:25:01] a shame or disgrace for a woman who is
[1:25:03] supposed to look
[1:25:06] pretty and having her hair all shaved
[1:25:10] off then let her hair let her have her
[1:25:14] covering on her
[1:25:19] head let her have long hair
[1:25:25] now basically we there are many things
[1:25:27] I'm going to
[1:25:28] cover but the major
[1:25:34] point of scripture regarding woman is
[1:25:38] ha is this
[1:25:41] one a woman should have long
[1:25:45] hair and long hair remember his uncut
[1:25:49] hair now I understand God has given you
[1:25:52] know us God is a god of variety
[1:25:56] you find some people some resters have
[1:25:58] longer hair and others have shorter
[1:26:01] hair you know but but God is a god of
[1:26:04] variety and he loves all these
[1:26:07] races and I will tell you what it is
[1:26:10] more beautiful to be the way God made
[1:26:14] you but you see when God gives you the
[1:26:17] hair he gives
[1:26:18] you it's going to be long
[1:26:21] hair as long as you don't cut it
[1:26:26] the moment you cut
[1:26:28] it then it is short hair even if it
[1:26:32] looks
[1:26:33] long it is short hair but if you don't
[1:26:36] cut your hair and you stand together
[1:26:39] with a sister from say
[1:26:43] London you know she's a European her
[1:26:46] hair goes to the and goes up to the
[1:26:50] shoulder but before God both of you have
[1:26:54] long
[1:26:55] hair but you see if even if even if her
[1:26:58] hair is up to the
[1:27:00] feet and she trims
[1:27:03] it it is no longer
[1:27:05] long because it is
[1:27:09] dream and for men the scripture says it
[1:27:14] is a shame for us to have long
[1:27:18] hair so brother always keep your hair
[1:27:22] shap it
[1:27:24] don't become
[1:27:26] a you find people wanting to become a
[1:27:29] they have spe
[1:27:32] of oh you know some other people you
[1:27:35] know they want to have the wrong
[1:27:37] dreads a Believer a Christian man how
[1:27:42] can you desire something like
[1:27:44] that you should want remember you know
[1:27:47] you should want to give God the glory in
[1:27:49] everything that you
[1:27:52] do praise the name of the Lord
[1:27:55] so the question is why have long hair
[1:27:58] then for the Sisters of First
[1:28:01] Corinthians 10 1110 it says for this
[1:28:04] cause the woman to have power on her
[1:28:07] head because of the
[1:28:12] angels and I'm going to um just read a
[1:28:16] small short quote out of the talken he
[1:28:18] says long hair this stand me it says
[1:28:21] long hair is a Nazarite vow
[1:28:27] and I don't think it is a
[1:28:30] coincidence where he says the woman
[1:28:32] ought to have power on her
[1:28:35] head you remember how many remember
[1:28:38] Samson you know Samson had a Nazarite
[1:28:41] vow
[1:28:43] with naite vow
[1:28:46] Works he kept the
[1:28:48] power for as long as he did not put a Le
[1:28:51] Bread on his head
[1:28:56] he had the power he was the most
[1:28:58] powerful man in
[1:29:00] Israel for as long as his head was not
[1:29:04] touched with the
[1:29:05] R so we see here he says it show that
[1:29:09] that you've cut yourself from the
[1:29:13] world to obey the word and I Believe
[1:29:17] Christian
[1:29:18] women they are showing that they have
[1:29:20] obeyed the
[1:29:22] word and they have cut themselves from
[1:29:24] the W and they have a Nazarite vow
[1:29:29] with samon let his hair grow
[1:29:33] out for aite
[1:29:36] vow and I believe our sisters the Bible
[1:29:38] says you see a woman has to have
[1:29:43] power on our head because of the
[1:29:47] Angels explain that part of the
[1:29:50] Angels I'm sorry I'm going to read a lot
[1:29:52] of stuff for you today and I just want
[1:29:54] to be attentive
[1:29:56] and in the message
[1:29:58] oness says a woman wrote me a question
[1:30:01] the other
[1:30:02] day she said brother Bram oh no it was a
[1:30:05] man a minister he may be standing here
[1:30:08] this
[1:30:10] morning from some place in
[1:30:13] Ohio we want to say the same thing that
[1:30:16] you
[1:30:18] do but we found something on your tapes
[1:30:21] that's not right
[1:30:25] these were some like some of the
[1:30:26] preachers
[1:30:27] today who read some quotes of this is
[1:30:31] not
[1:30:32] correct so Billy brought me the letter
[1:30:35] Billy brought the letter to
[1:30:37] me said something on your
[1:30:40] T is very contradictory by the to the
[1:30:43] word
[1:30:44] of and we want to say what we want to
[1:30:49] say the same thing you
[1:30:52] know said one question I want to say to
[1:30:57] you that's First
[1:30:59] Corinthians the 11th
[1:31:01] chapter it says that about the head
[1:31:04] covering for the
[1:31:07] women and the men not to have a
[1:31:10] covering said we believe
[1:31:13] that the women should wear hearts in the
[1:31:18] church this is a letter a letter that
[1:31:20] these people sent to brother B
[1:31:24] and the men should take their hearts off
[1:31:26] in the
[1:31:28] church say we believe them head
[1:31:30] coverings and so
[1:31:33] forth and said then another question is
[1:31:37] that the people come to us and they say
[1:31:39] the angel of the Lord speaks everything
[1:31:40] to
[1:31:43] you every word that you speak is from
[1:31:45] the angel of the
[1:31:47] Lord and brother bam it is so hard to
[1:31:49] fight against something like that
[1:31:54] said in my church said we want to say
[1:31:57] the same
[1:31:59] thing now brother Bram don't you believe
[1:32:04] that you was a little in error
[1:32:06] there cuz now they according to them
[1:32:09] they say that a woman should have a
[1:32:12] heart and a man should remove his
[1:32:15] heart so and they saying by the BAM you
[1:32:18] are the way you explained it to
[1:32:20] us don't you think you are in error
[1:32:24] and he says I wrote
[1:32:27] back do you want to hear what the
[1:32:29] prophet
[1:32:30] wrote my precious brother I am not in
[1:32:35] error hallelujah our Prophet is not in
[1:32:41] error the First Corinthians the 11th
[1:32:43] chapter say a woman should have her head
[1:32:48] covered and why the 15th verse said her
[1:32:52] long hair long hair is given to her for
[1:33:01] cover not a
[1:33:03] heart that Catholic Spirit dominated the
[1:33:05] church long
[1:33:08] enough how long hair is her
[1:33:13] covering
[1:33:15] teach and look and then the question
[1:33:17] come back somebody asked me sometime
[1:33:20] ago I'll explain it while I'm at at it
[1:33:25] he said well the bible say that she
[1:33:27] should have long hair because of the
[1:33:31] Angels what is the Angels going to do
[1:33:34] with a
[1:33:35] woman I said what is an
[1:33:38] angel It's a
[1:33:40] messenger what is Paul saying if a true
[1:33:44] Messenger an angel from God comes by
[1:33:49] You' better have long
[1:33:51] hair he will condemn the thing
[1:33:57] Willem that that's right that means
[1:34:00] every Ang of God every man of God every
[1:34:04] preacher from God will condemn women
[1:34:07] having short
[1:34:09] hair will condemn women cutting their
[1:34:13] hair that is it so which means men or
[1:34:17] pastors who actually let their women cut
[1:34:20] their hair or trim it or do things like
[1:34:22] that
[1:34:24] They Are Not Angels of
[1:34:26] God simply
[1:34:29] put praise the name of the Lord a
[1:34:32] messenger from God will condemn
[1:34:35] it said you better have long
[1:34:38] hair because of the Angels the messenger
[1:34:41] sent from God comes
[1:34:43] by Will condemn that s yes indeed
[1:34:47] because a real messenger from
[1:34:49] God an angel is connected with God
[1:34:54] and his word Can't
[1:34:57] Fail that's exactly right St Paul said
[1:35:00] there that even if an angel from heaven
[1:35:02] come and told anything else let him be a
[1:35:08] cur that's right now we find out that
[1:35:11] that's
[1:35:12] true she should have long hair that's
[1:35:14] her
[1:35:16] covering but he says um I imagine this
[1:35:20] pretty moabite women
[1:35:25] were very beautiful they might have been
[1:35:27] fixed up some like some of the modern
[1:35:30] Jezebels of
[1:35:33] today but however not all
[1:35:36] women I think a woman that's
[1:35:41] genuine a woman that is
[1:35:43] genuine is a
[1:35:46] jewel praise God for a real
[1:35:49] woman we have real women in this
[1:35:52] church the B said you are a
[1:35:57] Jew you are God's
[1:36:00] [Music]
[1:36:02] handmaid yes but a real woman is like a
[1:36:05] real is like a real man they will follow
[1:36:07] the word of God regardless of what the
[1:36:14] devil and they say our Pastor said it's
[1:36:17] all right to do
[1:36:19] this you know actually actually there
[1:36:23] some pastors who are so
[1:36:27] invested in other
[1:36:30] things they would tell the women don't
[1:36:32] do this don't do that in your hair don't
[1:36:34] do that in your
[1:36:35] [Music]
[1:36:37] ha for
[1:36:39] cutting that's
[1:36:43] okay you find a girl a big
[1:36:46] girl 20 years she's because she's a
[1:36:49] student so C and because she's not
[1:36:52] married so
[1:36:54] then she's not a Woman They say she's
[1:36:55] not a woman she can
[1:36:58] cut what happened to teaching
[1:37:02] children and raising them in the way
[1:37:04] they should
[1:37:06] go the Bible says raise up a
[1:37:09] child in the way should go when they
[1:37:12] grow they will not depart from
[1:37:15] it from
[1:37:17] childhood God should know their hair is
[1:37:20] their Glory
[1:37:23] hair is
[1:37:25] Untouchable it should not be cut it
[1:37:28] should not be reduced it should not be
[1:37:31] removed and he says and our Pastor said
[1:37:34] it's all right to do
[1:37:36] this I don't care what your pastor
[1:37:39] said if it is contrary to the word of
[1:37:43] God let your pastor's word be a
[1:37:47] lie and keep God's
[1:37:51] word I don't care what denomination it
[1:37:53] is or
[1:37:54] what if he's got anything to say about
[1:37:57] it let him look into the word of
[1:38:01] God listen friends we don't care what
[1:38:04] the world says and the system of the
[1:38:06] world
[1:38:19] say a woman
[1:38:23] a man the father of the
[1:38:25] house you should have a
[1:38:28] backbone of standing for the
[1:38:32] word and teaching your family to stand
[1:38:35] for the
[1:38:37] word can we have people who believe that
[1:38:39] and say
[1:38:41] Amen we should stand for the
[1:38:44] word because the word is not our word is
[1:38:47] the word of
[1:38:50] God so you see from a god from
[1:38:55] childhood she should be raised up
[1:38:58] knowing that my hair is my
[1:39:00] [Music]
[1:39:03] glory amen and I thank God all my three
[1:39:06] girls are ra has never touched their
[1:39:11] head since they were born
[1:39:13] yes and someone said oh when a child is
[1:39:16] born you know you need to First remove
[1:39:19] that first layer of the hair so that
[1:39:21] they can have the beautiful hair
[1:39:24] where did you get that idea from he is
[1:39:27] not in the message I don't say what
[1:39:29] you're doing is wrong but what I'm
[1:39:31] saying is I would rather you teach them
[1:39:34] while they were young from
[1:39:36] childh I believe Samson from childhood
[1:39:39] no touched
[1:39:42] his and I believe God has given you girl
[1:39:47] children raise them from
[1:39:50] childhood them knowing my hair is my
[1:39:55] no res blade touching my
[1:39:58] hair no sciss touching my
[1:40:01] hair no machine touching my hair my hair
[1:40:05] is given me for a
[1:40:08] covering praise the name of the Lord and
[1:40:11] so it is a shame having fathers and
[1:40:16] mothers Believers of this
[1:40:19] message because they want a good school
[1:40:21] so
[1:40:23] for their children and they take them to
[1:40:25] a school where they cut
[1:40:29] hair well of course we want to take what
[1:40:31] the messengers told us what the Bible
[1:40:36] says
[1:40:38] amen we have now many
[1:40:42] schools which will actually accept girls
[1:40:46] to have long
[1:40:48] hair if this school doesn't allow
[1:40:51] you change the child to another
[1:40:55] that will allow you have a backbone for
[1:40:57] the
[1:40:59] word and God will stand with you every
[1:41:03] part of the word is God's
[1:41:05] word there is no small word big
[1:41:09] word every word is big
[1:41:12] word and every word of God is perfect
[1:41:15] word so my
[1:41:17] sisters have your hair grow
[1:41:20] out don't cut your hair
[1:41:24] don't reduce your hair leave it to grow
[1:41:28] for that hair is your
[1:41:30] glory if you cut it if you reduce it it
[1:41:34] is better you remove
[1:41:37] everything and you remain clean clear
[1:41:42] sheven but it is a shame for you to be
[1:41:45] that
[1:41:46] way you should let your hair grow
[1:41:49] up hallelujah amen
[1:41:54] the God of this evil age says and a
[1:41:56] woman that will cut a
[1:41:59] hair dishonors a
[1:42:01] head is a sinful
[1:42:04] thing for a woman to offer prayer with
[1:42:07] short
[1:42:08] hair do you believe your
[1:42:11] Prophet oh only 10% that believe do you
[1:42:15] believe your
[1:42:16] Prophet are these message Believers here
[1:42:20] today it is a sinful thing for a woman
[1:42:24] to offer prayer with short
[1:42:27] hair I don't understand it either but I
[1:42:30] believe
[1:42:31] it the Bible said
[1:42:34] so pray in public with a hair
[1:42:38] uncovered or you say I wear a
[1:42:42] heart oh these next words are very
[1:42:45] powerful now listen don't be offended
[1:42:48] now just believe it he says he say you
[1:42:51] say I wear a heart he says you
[1:42:55] hypocrite teach them women such things
[1:42:57] as
[1:43:00] that when the Bible said her hair is
[1:43:02] given her for
[1:43:06] cover not some man made
[1:43:10] heart that's why the Bible said I am not
[1:43:15] responsible I am only responsible to
[1:43:17] tell the
[1:43:19] truth don't be dishonest
[1:43:24] as the Bible says handling the word of
[1:43:25] God with
[1:43:28] deceit to fix or to meet the request of
[1:43:30] a bunch
[1:43:35] of we say what he
[1:43:38] says and that settles
[1:43:41] it praise the name of the Lord and so
[1:43:44] there is no way I can deal with the
[1:43:48] hair talking about the issue of plating
[1:43:50] the hair
[1:43:54] because you see this is has been an
[1:43:56] issue and it's been brought up many
[1:43:59] times but you see how Prophet has been
[1:44:02] very
[1:44:03] clear what he has
[1:44:06] emphasized is what is in First
[1:44:09] Corinthians and he said women should
[1:44:11] have long
[1:44:12] hair long hair is uncut hair and
[1:44:15] somewhere else actually he says after
[1:44:17] that I don't know where to
[1:44:20] go there are many other ideas this that
[1:44:23] this and
[1:44:24] that before I read the next things what
[1:44:28] I want to tell you is really after
[1:44:32] that is what the Holy Spirit leads
[1:44:34] somebody to
[1:44:39] do you need to understand what I'm
[1:44:42] saying amen Beyond a woman having uncut
[1:44:49] hair you see you see beyond a woman
[1:44:53] having uncut hair yeah you said it
[1:44:57] right after that and beyond
[1:45:00] that we have no
[1:45:03] laws or
[1:45:04] rules now someone told you Pastor when
[1:45:07] you say
[1:45:09] that you give people a
[1:45:12] license to do everything the world is
[1:45:16] doing well I would say this is a clear
[1:45:19] sign those people who will do everything
[1:45:22] the world is do
[1:45:24] are not filled with the Holy
[1:45:26] Ghost because if you're filled with the
[1:45:28] Holy Ghost he would literally tell you
[1:45:31] everything about your
[1:45:34] life the Bible says he will show you
[1:45:36] things to
[1:45:37] come he will guide you into all
[1:45:40] truth he will make sure you don't go
[1:45:42] into
[1:45:43] error that is the work of the Holy
[1:45:46] Spirit he will tell you even what cloth
[1:45:49] to
[1:45:50] wear you may like a good jumper a good
[1:45:54] and then you go see that word on
[1:45:58] it and the Holy Spirit will tell you no
[1:46:00] don't buy this one and you walk away
[1:46:02] from
[1:46:03] me and someone will tell you but this is
[1:46:05] what you
[1:46:06] wanted the Holy Spirit has told
[1:46:09] me you see the Holy Spirit should lead
[1:46:12] us how even what design to have in your
[1:46:16] head how to keep your
[1:46:19] hair even what kind of pom or pom or or
[1:46:23] J or whatever you want to call it
[1:46:25] whatever you're putting
[1:46:26] there the Holy Spirit should lead you on
[1:46:30] those because if he doesn't quite
[1:46:33] frankly you may do what your pastor
[1:46:35] tells you to
[1:46:36] do but you will never please God because
[1:46:39] pleasing God is on the basis of
[1:46:43] faith
[1:46:45] not faith without faith it is impossible
[1:46:49] to please God praise the name of the
[1:46:52] Lord and so now uh on that basis I'll
[1:46:55] will now approach this issue of plating
[1:47:00] there first Timothy
[1:47:04] 2:9 in like manner also that women Ador
[1:47:08] themselves in modest appar with
[1:47:10] shamefacedness and sobriety not with
[1:47:13] braded hair or gold or Ps or coly AR but
[1:47:17] which becometh women professing godl
[1:47:19] with good works
[1:47:30] [Music]
[1:47:40] okay so now when people read
[1:47:42] this
[1:47:44] many people in the denominational
[1:47:47] world before they even received the
[1:47:51] message they said women should should
[1:47:52] not braid their
[1:47:55] hair women should not you know and
[1:47:59] things like that and they should not
[1:48:01] wear
[1:48:03] gold
[1:48:05] PS and
[1:48:08] clothes but you see you need to
[1:48:11] understand the speed behind this
[1:48:15] scripture and before I read what our
[1:48:17] Prophet says I'll read what the
[1:48:18] Amplified version says
[1:48:28] likewise I want women to Ador themselves
[1:48:34] modestly and
[1:48:37] appropriately and
[1:48:40] discretely in proper
[1:48:46] clothing not with
[1:48:48] elaborately braided hair
[1:48:54] you can get it you can do it brother I'm
[1:48:56] sure you can he says not with
[1:48:58] elaborately braided
[1:49:04] hair
[1:49:10] okay and
[1:49:12] gold or P or expensive
[1:49:16] cloes but instead Ador by Good Deeds
[1:49:23] helping others as is proper for women
[1:49:25] who profess to worship
[1:49:28] God so now you understand that Believers
[1:49:31] must always be different from the
[1:49:35] world the world will always be different
[1:49:37] from
[1:49:39] Believers you see is not it's not
[1:49:42] possible for a Believer to copy the
[1:49:45] styles of the
[1:49:48] world the new dress that has come
[1:49:50] up by the way those cheap cheap clo that
[1:49:54] show their
[1:49:56] body you will find is very
[1:50:00] expensive and then you wonder why why is
[1:50:02] a woman spending
[1:50:04] 500€ 1,000 on such a
[1:50:14] cloth what the speaking about here the
[1:50:17] Bible is not saying women should not all
[1:50:19] together wear clothes
[1:50:23] oh should not wear good clothes that are
[1:50:27] expensive but he's saying they should
[1:50:28] not wear such wildly fashionable
[1:50:32] expensive
[1:50:38] clothes the Bible is not saying here
[1:50:40] that believer should only buy second
[1:50:45] hand no that's not what it's saying you
[1:50:49] will not buy a new cloth because the
[1:50:51] Bible says we should notar we expensive
[1:50:54] cloes no you you can actually wear a
[1:50:58] cloth of
[1:51:01] 200,000 even
[1:51:03] 500,000 for as long as it is way
[1:51:06] different from the fashion of the
[1:51:10] world and then here is's talking about
[1:51:13] elaborately elaborate braided
[1:51:18] hair you know you do what they do the
[1:51:21] pencil you do the pencil
[1:51:24] are you a Believer there a problem
[1:51:27] somewhere the new fashion in town you
[1:51:31] find a Believer doing
[1:51:33] it there is a problem the Bible says we
[1:51:36] should not amen be
[1:51:40] conformed but we should be renewed in
[1:51:42] our mind transformed by the renewing of
[1:51:46] our
[1:51:47] mind we are transformed by the word of
[1:51:50] God
[1:51:52] of the word we leave it
[1:51:55] alone there is no rule do this do this
[1:51:57] do this do
[1:52:00] this know don't put wuzi in
[1:52:05] whatever there is no law like that but
[1:52:09] what we are saying what is worldly leave
[1:52:12] it for the
[1:52:14] world but you see a Believer who is a
[1:52:17] Believer but he looks like
[1:52:21] wildly problem there that's what the
[1:52:24] Bible is talking about
[1:52:26] here gold the Bible is not say to wear
[1:52:31] gold but you see Believers don't wear
[1:52:34] gold like the
[1:52:37] unbelievers but it is not a sin to wear
[1:52:41] go are you hearing me gold and P is
[1:52:45] talking about
[1:52:49] jeel is it a to wear those things
[1:52:53] it's not a sin to wear them but you see
[1:52:57] the way the world does is not the way
[1:52:59] the Believers
[1:53:03] do you know a nice you know ho ghost F
[1:53:08] woman can have a wedding God
[1:53:12] ring may even maybe be given a necklace
[1:53:16] by a husband a good
[1:53:18] neckace simple and doesn't look
[1:53:21] elaborate and
[1:53:23] kind of things you know but you'll never
[1:53:26] find a Believer wearing you know
[1:53:31] earring and having 10 kog in the
[1:53:35] chest putting here putting
[1:53:40] here even hands can't touch
[1:53:43] properly because all over they are
[1:53:45] filled with gold and Po and and silver
[1:53:50] and here you see when you see a Believer
[1:53:54] you can see there's a
[1:53:56] difference between the believer and the
[1:54:00] world now first Timothy
[1:54:03] 2:9 is speaking in that
[1:54:07] line saying these things are wrong to
[1:54:10] do but he saying we should not do it
[1:54:13] like the
[1:54:15] world that's why said I only after
[1:54:19] scriptures he said don't don't cut your
[1:54:23] hair and don't look like the
[1:54:27] world and the rest I don't know what to
[1:54:31] say praise the name of the
[1:54:34] Lord so now he is questioned here in
[1:54:36] questions and answers part
[1:54:38] one brother Bram does this first Timothy
[1:54:42] 29 mean a woman cannot braid her
[1:54:48] hair does
[1:54:50] braid hair mean braided
[1:54:55] hair
[1:54:57] notice braided hair in that day was a
[1:55:00] sign of a street
[1:55:05] woman that is what she
[1:55:09] done braided her
[1:55:12] hair and Paul said to the
[1:55:15] Christians now that adoring not not
[1:55:19] don't let it be the braided or braided
[1:55:20] or braid is the same thing to braid
[1:55:22] their hair because it looked like the
[1:55:24] rest of the
[1:55:30] [Music]
[1:55:31] world even today you can braid your hair
[1:55:35] and you look
[1:55:38] wildly and you can braid your hair and
[1:55:40] you look
[1:55:43] saintly so what is the Judgment what's
[1:55:45] the best of
[1:55:48] judgment is the Holy Spirit you should
[1:55:51] judge
[1:55:52] by the spirit of
[1:55:55] God you see the Bible says everything is
[1:55:57] lawful to
[1:55:59] us but not everything is
[1:56:21] expedient

[2:22:33] hallelujah hallelujah amen I I'd like
[2:22:36] you to give me a few more minutes I I I
[2:22:37] summarize because there some portions
[2:22:41] like on things that bam talks about he
[2:22:42] calls them rats and wigs and
[2:22:51] questions and answers part four he says
[2:22:53] if a woman has got real thin
[2:22:57] hair and she wants to wear one of those
[2:23:01] rats orever what you call
[2:23:04] it my wife wears
[2:23:07] it she says her hair is
[2:23:10] thin and she got some kind of a thing
[2:23:13] about a big around looks like a great
[2:23:16] big oversized biscuit
[2:23:21] I don't know I think you know those
[2:23:23] rats not not not even a wig that's a
[2:23:27] hairpiece p i I searched it i i al also
[2:23:31] was thinking it is a it's um um how do
[2:23:34] you call it I was thinking it is a uh a
[2:23:39] wig but a rat is something
[2:23:42] else it's like I don't know how many
[2:23:45] women know it
[2:23:53] [Music]
[2:23:58] they call it under the hair and then the
[2:24:01] hair looks big as if it is
[2:24:04] mat it's also called a wig it's also
[2:24:07] called a Weg you have a word for it
[2:24:10] weave
[2:24:13] weave I wouldn't there something else
[2:24:15] you go search a hair rat you'll find
[2:24:18] something I don't think we use it much
[2:24:20] here in
[2:24:21] Africa because our hair is not usually
[2:24:24] that much and that kind of texture but
[2:24:27] anyways it says his wife was wearing
[2:24:30] it and some of it is a wig you know the
[2:24:34] one that also you can wear
[2:24:39] and you know she's um and she wraps her
[2:24:42] hair around okay the one that she was
[2:24:45] wearing she puts it there and then she
[2:24:47] wraps her hair around it and pins it
[2:24:58] as far as I'm
[2:25:00] concerned he was asked what about that
[2:25:03] he said that don't bother
[2:25:04] anything as long as your hair is
[2:25:07] long Minister said his wife was
[2:25:09] condemned because she had a tint in her
[2:25:15] hair and I found out from a question
[2:25:17] that means that means a paint or a
[2:25:19] coloring in a
[2:25:24] I can't say that is
[2:25:26] wrong I have nothing about
[2:25:28] it if she got long
[2:25:31] hair that's all I can say about it for
[2:25:35] the other one I don't know what to
[2:25:37] say this person said this
[2:25:39] morning taking off their hair and
[2:25:42] putting it back on and now this kind of
[2:25:44] got here too about a haircut now if a
[2:25:46] man doesn't have
[2:25:49] hair oh his wife I've heard a woman say
[2:25:52] well if I could just get John I think he
[2:25:54] would look better if he had a if he wore
[2:25:57] a
[2:26:01] hairpiece what do you think about it
[2:26:03] brother
[2:26:04] BR you know like some men they actually
[2:26:08] have bold
[2:26:11] head so it says it would he would look
[2:26:14] better my husband look
[2:26:16] better if you would have put on a we
[2:26:21] you see I think I don't think we do that
[2:26:23] much here in
[2:26:27] Africa if you what do you think about it
[2:26:30] brother
[2:26:30] bam is it wrong for him to do
[2:26:34] it I'm sure 100% of you would say
[2:26:37] brother says yes it's
[2:26:40] sinful but here is what he said no sir
[2:26:45] no indeed it is not wrong not at all if
[2:26:49] he wants to wear
[2:26:52] no more than wearing
[2:26:58] teeth or whatever that come
[2:27:00] along by the way I've got three for Te
[2:27:05] myself I wish they didn't have
[2:27:08] them they are on a wire and they always
[2:27:10] Shen my
[2:27:13] voice and they cut my tongue and
[2:27:15] everything
[2:27:17] else so he says um so I I I um when I'm
[2:27:22] overseas on them outside meetings I wear
[2:27:24] a
[2:27:28] hairpiece not because for the looks of
[2:27:31] it because you know I would stand right
[2:27:34] here and I don't I didn't have a hair on
[2:27:37] top of my head and whatever it
[2:27:41] was it wouldn't make no difference I'm
[2:27:44] here to represent Jesus Christ I love
[2:27:47] that
[2:27:48] attitude showing it not wrong to do
[2:27:50] those
[2:27:51] things but I don't care how I
[2:27:55] look it's all about Jesus
[2:27:59] Christ but you see he's trying to show
[2:28:01] you the motive behind what you're
[2:28:06] doing but when I stand out
[2:28:09] there about the first night in one of
[2:28:11] them tropical storms the next night my
[2:28:13] throat is so so I can't get up
[2:28:22] so if it was something I wanted to
[2:28:24] do and Fa to do
[2:28:26] it I fail to do it I would do it yes sir
[2:28:32] there is not a thing says not to do
[2:28:34] it not a thing say sister that you you
[2:28:37] can't wear a
[2:28:41] rat or switch of
[2:28:43] hair or something or
[2:28:45] another that's perfectly all right
[2:28:50] but let your hair stay
[2:28:54] long and man you cut your
[2:28:57] off what you got keep it
[2:29:00] cut and woman you dress like a
[2:29:03] woman and man you dress like a man don't
[2:29:07] try to be a siss and wear some women's
[2:29:11] clothes and women don't you try to be
[2:29:14] myle and wear a man's
[2:29:17] cloes because God don't want you to do
[2:29:21] it the Bible condemns
[2:29:23] it but now about wearing a hair a piece
[2:29:27] of hair or wearing a hair well what is
[2:29:30] one of those rats something a woman puts
[2:29:32] in her hair to make it look more ever
[2:29:35] what it is there is nothing wrong
[2:29:42] with go ahead it's all right now do we
[2:29:46] believe this to be the word of God do we
[2:29:49] believe it to be the word of God
[2:29:51] now I understand the Believers who
[2:29:55] believe it like I
[2:29:57] do that have your natural
[2:30:00] hair and brother B believe that
[2:30:03] too he keeps pushing for
[2:30:07] that look natural
[2:30:10] look look the way God made you look and
[2:30:13] when you go in some of Evangelistic
[2:30:17] sermons that's why people ask this
[2:30:19] question
[2:30:21] because he was hitting on these
[2:30:23] things putting on these addons and
[2:30:26] things he always meting on it and these
[2:30:30] people asked him questions is it wrong
[2:30:34] he says no it is not wrong so now you
[2:30:37] find some very good old um Unholy ghost
[2:30:42] a person who is not filled with the Holy
[2:30:46] ghow praise God the prophet said is not
[2:30:50] wrong and then from the church they just
[2:30:52] go I want the best
[2:30:56] wig how much the wi how much the week
[2:31:00] the pastor read for us the prop he said
[2:31:02] it's not
[2:31:03] wrong why did you take that
[2:31:06] part why didn't you take the part that
[2:31:09] says stay with your natural
[2:31:11] hair a problem with your
[2:31:14] experience so you see you find Brothers
[2:31:18] would say if a sister we a
[2:31:21] wig she's going to hell they are not
[2:31:24] Believers you are wrong our Prophet said
[2:31:28] it is all
[2:31:29] right but it's it's not all right for
[2:31:33] me as a person I have my personal walk
[2:31:37] with the
[2:31:38] Lord and if I want my natural
[2:31:41] hair I want my natural hair I want to
[2:31:45] look that way I want to present myself
[2:31:48] that way I to be
[2:31:51] natural but the other who has small
[2:31:54] Revelation not filled with the Holy
[2:31:56] Ghost I'm not going to throw him to
[2:31:59] hell because he's doing what I cannot
[2:32:04] do you find someone dressing up to
[2:32:09] down and and and and and and you and and
[2:32:12] you you are dressing up to
[2:32:14] here below the knee and then you who
[2:32:17] dressing up to down
[2:32:20] sister you are going to H unless you
[2:32:22] repent what is my
[2:32:28] sin it is not a sin for her to dress
[2:32:33] a
[2:32:35] right is it a
[2:32:38] sin but I tell you for sure if I was
[2:32:41] choosing a
[2:32:43] wife I would not look for the one who
[2:32:45] dresses like
[2:32:47] this I would look for the one who is
[2:32:49] dressing up all
[2:32:51] the if I'm looking for a wife I won't
[2:32:55] look for the one with a
[2:32:59] wig why are you
[2:33:03] fake I want
[2:33:05] original I will look for the original
[2:33:09] sister with natural
[2:33:13] hair but as far as Doctrine is
[2:33:16] concerned it is all right
[2:33:20] you understand church so you have to be
[2:33:23] balanced in your
[2:33:26] approach and I was so shocked when bam
[2:33:29] dealt with this issue
[2:33:33] of if it says if it is wrong for me is
[2:33:37] it wrong for me to run a bit
[2:33:42] sh
[2:33:46] atian and don't believe in Christians
[2:33:48] cutting her hair
[2:33:51] but I cut others
[2:33:53] hair and I and I tint I tint their
[2:33:58] hair sister
[2:34:01] dear I wouldn't know what to tell
[2:34:04] you listen I can't say for women about
[2:34:09] that putting color in their
[2:34:12] hair I have no scripture against
[2:34:16] that I can only stay with the scripture
[2:34:22] I love my prophet he always right on
[2:34:26] scripture the scripture don't say for
[2:34:28] them not to do
[2:34:31] that the scripture says she must have
[2:34:33] long
[2:34:35] hair and after that I don't know where
[2:34:39] to
[2:34:42] go so if you you want your
[2:34:46] tint I don't know where to
[2:34:48] go but as your pastor I'm going to ask
[2:34:51] you do you have the Holy Ghost does the
[2:34:54] Holy Ghost want you to tint your
[2:34:57] hair so the prophet never assumed the
[2:35:01] position of the Holy
[2:35:03] [Music]
[2:35:04] Spirit why do we do it as
[2:35:08] pastors we should let the Holy Spirit do
[2:35:11] his work in the
[2:35:13] people but we should preach the
[2:35:16] word we should be instant in season
[2:35:21] the word will always correct the
[2:35:24] error you find people who are always
[2:35:28] picky this one looks like
[2:35:31] that he says here the scripture don't
[2:35:34] say for me to tell D not to do
[2:35:37] that the scrip says she must have long
[2:35:41] hair after that I don't know where to
[2:35:44] go don't know nothing about that
[2:35:50] hey my praise God now little minister is
[2:35:55] present here somewhere I know a dear
[2:35:57] friend of mine we was talking together
[2:35:59] the other day at the blue ball when we
[2:36:01] was having dinner he said my wife's kind
[2:36:04] of ashamed to come before you a very
[2:36:06] saintly goodly little woman she's pretty
[2:36:08] little lady grandmother and but she's
[2:36:10] nice a clean little you know my wife's
[2:36:13] just crazy about this woman and I think
[2:36:15] she's a real real woman I don't know if
[2:36:18] she's sitting here I guess she is I
[2:36:20] think her husband is here and she said
[2:36:21] to me he said she let her hair grow out
[2:36:24] after she had you preach and she seen it
[2:36:27] it was right but say she's been using
[2:36:29] some coloring in her hair and she's
[2:36:31] trying her best to get all that color to
[2:36:34] grow out before she comes around where
[2:36:36] you are hallu
[2:36:52] [Music]
[2:36:57] now look sister dear I high respect that
[2:37:02] I have a honor for a woman that will do
[2:37:05] that for some woman just to come up and
[2:37:08] do her hair
[2:37:11] anywh speit in your face and walk around
[2:37:14] arrogant and no respects at
[2:37:18] all remember Jesus said what you do to
[2:37:20] these little ones you do it unto
[2:37:23] me and I respect that in you
[2:37:27] sister God will bless you for
[2:37:29] that but sister about the hair color or
[2:37:34] something like
[2:37:36] that I don't
[2:37:39] know don't you want to be led by a
[2:37:42] prophet who says I don't know when he
[2:37:44] doesn't
[2:37:47] know this is sincerity
[2:37:51] I can't back that up with the
[2:37:54] scripture that is up to
[2:37:58] you oh Pastor don't read that
[2:38:02] quote people are going to get
[2:38:05] spoiled look those without the holy
[2:38:07] spirit will
[2:38:08] be but those with the holy spirit will
[2:38:12] feed on the
[2:38:15] word you if you want to do it
[2:38:19] that's perfectly all right with
[2:38:21] me as far as I know the church has no
[2:38:25] such
[2:38:27] custom anything that's not in in this
[2:38:32] Bible that's up to
[2:38:35] youu but I'll give you my
[2:38:40] advice you see as far as I would
[2:38:43] know it's just the nature of women to
[2:38:45] want to look pretty
[2:38:50] she's supposed to be that
[2:38:52] way you know in every life there is the
[2:38:54] male is
[2:38:56] [Music]
[2:38:59] prettiest and you know I don't know
[2:39:01] whether I should read you this story but
[2:39:03] maybe I should skip it because of time
[2:39:05] but here he was talking about you need
[2:39:07] to go and read that yourself you can see
[2:39:09] the quote up there and those of you who
[2:39:11] are following online you can as well do
[2:39:13] it and and read it on on your own
[2:39:15] because of
[2:39:16] time questions and anwers 6 4823 a.m.
[2:39:21] excuse me they were speaking about the
[2:39:23] woman wanted to be pretty and look
[2:39:27] beautiful and in every other creatures
[2:39:30] the male is the
[2:39:33] prettiest but you see in the human race
[2:39:36] the woman is
[2:39:38] the and they said why she caused the
[2:39:42] fall Satan chose
[2:39:46] her and beauty is of the devil
[2:39:52] after brother bham
[2:39:54] stands he doesn't condemn according to
[2:39:56] the Bible this sister who has color in
[2:39:58] her
[2:40:01] hair and he says anyway it's all right
[2:40:04] it's up to you I cannot say it is wrong
[2:40:05] as far as I'm
[2:40:08] concerned but then he continues on and
[2:40:10] he says you see women it is in their
[2:40:14] nature to want to be
[2:40:17] beautiful but then he says why you see
[2:40:21] you see the female to the human is the
[2:40:24] most
[2:40:27] beautiful she caused
[2:40:29] the SAT chose her right
[2:40:33] there and beauty is of the
[2:40:37] devil Satan was the most beautiful
[2:40:40] angel he was the CH beam that
[2:40:44] overshadow look how different the woman
[2:40:47] is getting now to what they used to
[2:40:53] be and then he talks about a woman
[2:40:55] called PA briyan who was very beautiful
[2:40:57] at the
[2:41:00] time and now he says there are others
[2:41:02] who are much more beautiful than
[2:41:05] her you see and then it says just
[2:41:08] exactly what the Bible said when the
[2:41:10] sons of God saw the daughters of men
[2:41:11] were
[2:41:16] fa that was a bunch of Renegades that
[2:41:18] sent flood upon the
[2:41:22] Earth that God destroy the whole human
[2:41:26] race and today everything is based upon
[2:41:31] Hollywood and beauty and things like
[2:41:39] that when beauty is the secret thing of
[2:41:42] the
[2:41:45] heart I just pray that you you open your
[2:41:48] mind to receive this
[2:41:51] he's trying to to say here naturally a
[2:41:54] woman wants to look
[2:41:56] beautiful that's why they do all the
[2:41:58] things they
[2:41:59] do they will tell you show me why does
[2:42:01] the bible condemn
[2:42:04] me when you see a Believer when you read
[2:42:07] this quote you will see beyond what the
[2:42:09] prophet
[2:42:13] say is showing you what that has caused
[2:42:17] the world
[2:42:20] from the very beginning with
[2:42:23] Eve wanting to be
[2:42:25] beautiful right over to the devil he is
[2:42:29] the most beautiful by the way do you
[2:42:31] know Satan is
[2:42:35] beautiful some people thought the devil
[2:42:37] is some ugly guy with some
[2:42:39] horns Satan is very
[2:42:42] beautiful very
[2:42:44] beautiful he was one of the Angels
[2:42:49] God doesn't have ugly
[2:42:51] angels and when he
[2:42:53] fell he didn't become
[2:42:55] ugly see all the
[2:42:57] prostitutes see all the boys out there
[2:43:00] that the devil uses to destroy a
[2:43:03] generation beautiful and
[2:43:06] handsome the devil doesn't choose any
[2:43:08] ugly person
[2:43:09] by I can tell you preachers who are very
[2:43:13] ugly but I don't know a singer who is
[2:43:16] ugly
[2:43:20] the olders who were singing music taking
[2:43:22] people to
[2:43:24] hell they look so presentable and so
[2:43:26] beautiful and so handsome and so nice
[2:43:29] and you know they do this makeup thing
[2:43:32] and make their hair certain way and
[2:43:34] things like that you see and it says it
[2:43:37] was a bunch of
[2:43:40] Renegades that sent the floods upon the
[2:43:43] Earth to destroy the whole human
[2:43:47] race and today everything is based upon
[2:43:51] Hollywood Beauty and things like
[2:43:54] that and he says what is beauty beauty
[2:43:58] is supposed to be a secr thing of the
[2:44:03] heart that's what Timothy was saying
[2:44:06] amen that's what you know we read here
[2:44:08] you know Peter that's what Peter was
[2:44:11] saying the secret beauty of the
[2:44:16] heart that should be what the woman has
[2:44:21] how much je she
[2:44:23] has how she makes her
[2:44:26] hair but how she's so beautiful me
[2:44:31] humble cont in
[2:44:34] spirit able to take God at every
[2:44:38] word let them ad themselves not without
[2:44:44] whaton of
[2:44:46] appearance but word
[2:44:50] me and
[2:44:52] gentle that is the
[2:44:54] Christian praise the name of the Lord so
[2:44:58] he says I can stop right now or take
[2:45:00] another 30
[2:45:03] minutes praise the name of the Lord and
[2:45:06] I think me too as
[2:45:08] well and he goes ahead to speak about um
[2:45:12] you know a
[2:45:15] hair actually I love the way he talked
[2:45:18] about uh the the cap the socks cup the
[2:45:22] socks cap you know they do that during
[2:45:25] the time of
[2:45:29] coldness and I think you will love this
[2:45:32] quote as I'm approaching to finish
[2:45:34] here and losing my hair as a young
[2:45:39] man putting carbonic acid on it AB
[2:45:46] did and took it all out when I was just
[2:45:49] a
[2:45:51] boy and it's been always a kind of a
[2:45:53] thing to me and I get cold so quick
[2:45:55] because of my scalp is still soft you
[2:46:03] know and the roots of the hair is still
[2:46:08] there it was burnt by carbonic
[2:46:12] acid can never
[2:46:14] grow so I went and I went my wife and I
[2:46:18] long years ago and got a hair piece to
[2:46:20] wear a little piece of
[2:46:25] hair I was always ashamed to wear
[2:46:30] it because it looked like it was
[2:46:32] something
[2:46:35] false and I didn't want nothing
[2:46:39] false how many want something
[2:46:43] false praise the name of the
[2:46:45] Lord oh I think lug we have a good one
[2:46:49] the prophet says I didn't want nothing
[2:46:52] forse I believe if you Holy Ghost fi you
[2:46:54] won't want anything
[2:46:57] false and so I thought I would just put
[2:46:59] on a stocking
[2:47:03] C yes that I did for a
[2:47:07] while you know what they did you know
[2:47:10] what they
[2:47:12] did they wanted to call me a bishop
[2:47:16] there then they said you know the way
[2:47:19] you put it
[2:47:21] on it makes you look like a pop or
[2:47:24] something so they began calling me
[2:47:27] Bishop so I said let her
[2:47:31] go so I just I just suffer out of the
[2:47:36] B he raising them windows you know and
[2:47:39] so my you fellows that's got
[2:47:42] hair you don't know how thankful you
[2:47:45] should
[2:47:47] be and
[2:47:51] that is right sister if you have your
[2:47:54] long
[2:47:55] ha let it grow
[2:47:57] out leave even this F hair
[2:48:03] alone you know leave these kind of
[2:48:05] things let your hair if you have it let
[2:48:08] it grow
[2:48:09] out I know I've seen some sisters who
[2:48:12] really truly do not have
[2:48:16] hair and surely they will need a
[2:48:21] that's a very very good
[2:48:24] reason I know of one who even refused to
[2:48:28] wear a
[2:48:29] wig he said God must make my hair
[2:48:32] grow I don't want to look
[2:48:36] false hair
[2:48:39] out God gives you according to your
[2:48:43] desire but you have hair you are putting
[2:48:47] weak putting you know something else be
[2:48:51] natural look like a
[2:48:54] Christian are you saying I'm
[2:48:58] wrong I'm encouraging you as your
[2:49:00] pastor on which way you should
[2:49:04] go praise the name of the
[2:49:08] Lord I wouldn't think it would be if it
[2:49:11] would be for a man if he wanted to wear
[2:49:13] a
[2:49:17] hairpiece it would be for a woman to
[2:49:19] wear one of those mouses or
[2:49:26] rats ever what they put in their hair
[2:49:28] like that to make it
[2:49:30] up but because if you do it it depends
[2:49:35] on what you doing it
[2:49:40] for it depends on what you're
[2:49:44] do and as I was about to finish studying
[2:49:49] I came across this quote in the message
[2:49:50] the resurrection he say did you ever
[2:49:54] think that the color of the hair that
[2:49:57] you
[2:49:58] got when you was a younger
[2:50:04] woman about
[2:50:06] 20 and you was a young man do you
[2:50:10] realize that it will be the same color
[2:50:12] of hair in the
[2:50:16] resurrection praise the name of the Lord
[2:50:19] I want to be original which means god
[2:50:22] tolds why he made me the way he made
[2:50:24] me I don't want to die my
[2:50:27] hair is it wrong or no it is not I don't
[2:50:30] want to do it I want to be the way God
[2:50:33] made me I
[2:50:36] myself because even in the
[2:50:38] resurrection I will appear the same
[2:50:41] way praise the name of the Lord
[2:50:44] hallelujah hallelujah let your hair grow
[2:50:47] out and stand as I read this last
[2:50:50] sad in the message Faith he says oh
[2:50:53] brother I don't care what some of this
[2:50:55] little overnight preaching
[2:50:58] does and it looks like today we have
[2:51:00] heard an overnight
[2:51:02] preaching but stick your chin up we are
[2:51:05] Sons and Daughters of
[2:51:09] God we made we may beated here but our
[2:51:13] father is a
[2:51:17] k how many believe that he says believe
[2:51:21] God don't matter what comes or
[2:51:24] goes conduct yourself like Sons and
[2:51:27] Daughters of
[2:51:29] God you women wash the paint off your
[2:51:34] face let your hair grow out
[2:51:39] again let your hair grow
[2:51:42] out you men that cigar put it out of
[2:51:45] your
[2:51:46] mouth and go out of here and act like
[2:51:49] Sons and Daughters of
[2:51:53] God put all this wasy Wishy doubling
[2:51:56] around about the place and conduct
[2:51:58] yourself like Sons and
[2:52:05] Daughters shall we
[2:52:08] pray father Lord there are many things
[2:52:11] that I might have
[2:52:14] said no doubt this is one of those long
[2:52:17] long services that have ever held
[2:52:21] here but I need to say all these
[2:52:25] things for our
[2:52:27] people and I pray Lord if there there's
[2:52:29] something
[2:52:30] said that is a miss a little
[2:52:33] bit may you correct it in the hearts of
[2:52:35] the
[2:52:37] people but most
[2:52:38] importantly we have heard the word may
[2:52:41] we take those little seats and may they
[2:52:44] impact our lives and may we desire to be
[2:52:48] more and more like
[2:52:50] you that we may resemble your image your
[2:52:54] sture your your nature that's how we
[2:52:57] want to be and for our sisters Lord we
[2:53:01] know that the beauty of the church is
[2:53:02] this is the
[2:53:04] people and if you want to know how the
[2:53:06] church is should look at how the
[2:53:10] sister they show the spiritual stat of
[2:53:12] the
[2:53:13] church if they carry on and and and go
[2:53:16] into all this jewly and
[2:53:20] kind of styles of the world of
[2:53:22] the father you will show that surely we
[2:53:26] are not feeding on the
[2:53:27] word but if they're feeding on the word
[2:53:30] you will surely draw them more to a
[2:53:33] quiet and mixed
[2:53:35] Spirit to desire to be like you more
[2:53:39] like granted father and if there is
[2:53:42] anyone with a
[2:53:43] question I pray that you will answer all
[2:53:45] those questions
