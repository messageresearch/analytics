that land and again that's when the battle started i will tell you where what and it started amen i mean praise the lord come here so by god disgrace we are now in our new place yeah amen nina uh it's not been easy i'm going to get to where we are now it's been with a lot of sacrifices made by very many people those of you who just came and saw it for your first time [Music] you knew how this place was looking challenged now you can see how it is looking again surely i can say it is grace there have been brothers who have come here and even spent nights i did not expect brother luang to have as much strength as he has this morning because literally these brothers have been working from monday up to yesterday really uh you cannot understand whatever i know that god understands and all your sacrifices that you have made god says god understands see there was very low lighting here have they've gotten so perfect because they've given you every place there's also been other brothers who came from other uh churches uh even uh you see all these curtains the carpet and cuppity uh the wallpaper everything some of you thought it was stones you know whatever you see here with your natural habawanu you know where you are seated look at around where you're going to detour today how does it look what fun i know what it's been sacrificed of somebody brother martin brother alex alex right here today i know brother andrew gonna fundraise right here you see brother andrew holgan andrew who kept me there's a day he came here i think he was coming from some office or something he was dressed very well yeah there was a request no brother you have to put the wallpaper i want to say we appreciate all these brothers could not even walk very well last night was always finding time to come through and there are many others who also had something that they did you know by the shame who kind of shame but the shame was always around to make sure people have eaten some time organization uh you know and i don't know who i have forgotten that was really here all throughout everything rather brilliant oh yeah all right brother also [Music] so god has been so good to us um i do not have all the details i would have wanted to give you this morning so i will need to maybe save that for next sunday we felt we felt that we have to do it this way why would it take in song so we've spent money a lot of money ninja no teller which we all including you are yet to pay seniors and uh like i said i don't have all the details and i would not want to give you the half details maybe what i can say is i want to appreciate those who have cleared off their pledges that they made what's the rental for this place a total of 1.5 million was paid uh of the 2.5 which was uh pledged and one million is due for payments i believe in worshipping god in spirit and in truth but i also believe in worshiping him in a good environment [Music] and i have a little heaven down here is one it should be portraying where i am going when the one you know so if someone can't if i bring someone to church they wouldn't really believe they would i believe they would not understand that the place i'm taking them to or that i'm promising them that the bible the word of god is promising them is really real to watch this you know you found there was a a a another young man preaching [Music] that prosperity is not a sign that god has favored you but i believe that children of god must not live in this in a sort of state because we worship a god who is more than enough for sins every single one how many believe that you see what he has given you is not enough he's going to give you more and what he has done for us is not enough he's going to bring more towards it i want to say this is just the beginning they're going to come back to academy in dc are there going to be battles whenever i went yes of course we are not blind we are not blind the truth is i can see and i know

[Music] [Music] um and this young man i forget his name i think his name was joe yeah let me tell you when he asked a question and the question took us to revelation 10. and i was still busy speaking with the brothers and so i asked her brother isaac to take him through revelation 10. so you're missing the whole story now i asked by the isaac to check through the other young man through revelation 10. and i was amazed at how much he knew of the scriptures and so as i heard them talk i i got an inspiration to speak on this this morning but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared unto his servants the prophets foreign praise the lord before i forget on thursday the lord willing i will be traveling to karamoja sadly we lost one of the translators so he was brought to malaga for when i understood that he was in a critical condition i asked i was trying to find out if another brother could be able to take up his responsibility and complete those underwent the operation but while he was on the hospital bed i talked to him after his operation he told me please do not give those chapters to anyone i want to translate them myself and uh i said okay but you have strength enough several messages which others have done a work that he has never done before the quantity of work he did i was actually even impressed i was about to call him and ask him how did you do all this yakuza so he asked one of the people uh brothers to take him to the hospital um and while there that very morning he passed away give those two last chapters to someone else in front yes sooner says the same by your side was uh on yesterday actually yes i'm not sure whether he was buried i've not had the latest but i know that the barrier funeral service was could be yesterday was our first service here the service here face okay i know i also did not have the funds to travel and then so we decided to uh push it to uh next week which will be on thursday [Music] [Music] but now we have something to remember our brother with brother marvin give me that church book for you now in the hall of karamoja now karamoja has this food caramel balinese tabachino so do things correctly that you will be remembered [Music] so this morning what i'm going to do is moreover teaching i'm not a good teacher although some think i am yeah but my uh gift usually runs into preaching but i pray that things will be said today which will help you and help all of us to get deeper into the knowledge of the world [Music] so that you can be at the fight you know sometimes i realize when the preacher is not preaching and but teaching getting into people [Music] what i'm speaking on our church is called days of the voice fellowship hey can you say that what days of the voice fellowship and i think the verse we have read today is the reason why you know the days of the voice now we have read the verse it says but in the days of the voice that doubles we need to hear the voice because without that it doesn't matter we are blind but we do not know man praise the name of the lord how many of us the worst situation that has ever bible disciple which we call the torah the twitter torah the old testament in the name and they would read out of the book of isaiah and others a son is because they were not sensitive to the spiritual things [Music] they were blind but they did not know and he told and the promise was given to the seed of abraham next tuesday when saturday i believe and we are the seed of abraham you can't curse us whoever you counted that is blessed you're not calling the promise was not to the natural seed of abraham only the seed of the woman and when he appeared on earth he was the one supposed to possess the gate of his enemies and that is why jesus the head of the serpent yes we are written into mutual minister but no other could tell him how could jesus even do that yes yes because it was the sea that was promised to come [Music] there is a group of people that you will never be blinded why do achieving comes by the voice that means there were other six engines i'm sorry i did not give you the one i have but if you can quickly get me the the picture because i want you to prepare to show it of the church ages okay because some people have never seen that and i want them to understand what you know about everyone go to the book of daniel chapter 12 verse one to four senators [Music] you have your bible expect you to turn there bible votes okay it says chapter 12 listen and at that time shall michael stand up the grand prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble [Music] such as never was since there was a nation even to this to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book [Music] i want you to pay attention very much to these scriptures what we are sharing on today what i'm sharing with you today is not my opinion [Music] was the youngest not just some ideas of uh some preacher coming from some place or maybe the ones that you are in a job i'm [Music] we have many denominations and they all read this bible see the way you read it you can people take this pipe and they take verses which they call favorite verses interpretation [Music] what is god planning for us i don't know how to take it do you think we are born just to live and eat and then die oh yeah there are some people who believe that what do you have until they're killed at you they will ask you where did you come from bakugan oh i am part of the people i know where they came from i know i was in the mind of god there was a foundation of the world and we have received the knowledge of the plan can we now cut it into it to change them praise the name of the lord come here and you will see it here now in the book of daniel this is prophetic i would not be this is prophetic and we'll get into the details we're going to get the neighbors with verse 2. many of them that sleep in the dust excuse me of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to a shame and everlasting contempt that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the famine [Music] okay [Applause] righteousness they will shine as they start forever because i know i will be as a shining [Applause] hallelujah amen this is the time for the mystery of god hey charmander be finished right follow me here now many shall run to and fro knowledge shall be increased all right now i would like us to look at this prophecy of daniel from verse one little by little people we can understand the mystery of god and at that time shall michael stand up the great priests which stand for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never worse since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book of [Music] okay church daniel was a prophet of god then he'd be hearing that you are catholic one of the great and major prophets in the world and daniel at the time when they were not in their during i think the reign of uh um of uh i don't remember the king probably the king of kazakhstan wherever he was daniel daniel was so much constrained in his heart to pray but it would only be for 70 years nothing could see now praying for the sins of his people repenting for them god remember themselves that you can be there listen to the revelation and gave him a timeline from the beginning to the end and now here in chapter 12 he received a a revelation about what would happen in the future now you need to understand that israel god deals with israel as a country [Music] [Music] israel is given an allotment of time yes and that time was 70 weeks of yes right now seven years a one week weekend is uh uh equal to seven years yes seven years here comes sam so we noticed that excuse me now we noticed that that time of the jewels was to [Music] but the messiah jesus christ by the time he came we had cheetah and he started this ministry he's the weak because remember god was still with the jews are you following me and the time of the dude was still counting continuing ending finishing but there was also a prophecy will not be that the messiah would be cut off and when the messiah is cut off then the times of the jews would be put to a point where you die at this occasion at a time of the gentiles would come in they turn the kid out also for a space of time until fulfillment has come when the time of the gentiles has been fulfilled god would go back to israel when jesus came on earth and he preached his ministry for three hours and a half and she said yes that was the first part of the last week of the jewish time and it was a half of the last week a week a symbiote so if you do not like math in school oh today is not going to get a good service [Music] the week of the of the gregorian and all that kind of things so now i'm teaching a different man those who are doing math in school don't go and say one week in seven years but here i mean i'm talking about something else to tell your neighbor one week is seven years now jesus yes his ministry was for how long but where is right mean and when jesus was cut off cut yes when you said he were by the death by them the truth killing him on the cross he denied him they [Applause] amen that's why we say we are children of abraham by promise whatever israel can claim we too can claim and now you see that brought in the gentle charge give me a child well of course they were churches in the time of the end at the time of the end and we are here and after tuesday we are the time of the end of church i'm coming end of the ceiling of the mystery and comedy [Music] i mean that is not our time oh what do you want to face for the jews no rachel that's that time will start counting again i don't think they're going to hold it forever [Music] [Applause] that is going to be a really fierce time it's going to be the time when the angels will let go there will be a time that is called the great tribulation do you know the only thing that is [Music] hallelujah amen that's why i'm so glad you never sent me amen my god i received the impossible to fly back from your passport amen the bible speaks of this time bible struggle shall be a great tribulation saturday was not since the beginning of the world to this time nor no never shall be matayo is [Music] [Music] you know i don't believe in kicking out anybody from the church oh my gosh i believe everybody should come and hear them everyone should have an equal opportunity now there is master today wrong you can repent of your sins you can change your life he says for in those days shall be affliction such as was not from the beginning of the creation which god created unto this time yes so oh revelation 16 18. voices and thunders and lightnings and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men [Music] lightning let me tell you during that time of the tribulation there will be voices and thunders and lightning circus there has never been before what's your power is great so that nine is like it it is even the time of jacob's trouble but he shall be saved out of it [Music] oh there is no salvation 144 jews coming out god even knows them by numbers and they shall be saved out of their troubles during the time of the last half of the last [Applause] and that's why i'm fighting this is our chance oh is the revelation of jesus christ [Music] that that had nothing to do with the gentiles meaning the gentile christ has nothing to do with it no type in that bible to that bible you know there are some people who believe that the church goes through the tribulation so no wonder where are the children the gospel they are preaching is the gospel of become rich [Music] [Music] amen because if you receive god seeing nothingness and all his righteousness that's the promise everything else will be upon us the car you will drive uh [Music] special let us continue and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt [Music] oh hallelujah amen now this speaks of the timeline of the bible what is happening usa america you see the new world order as we know it has to change new ideas over okay i'm not going through the details and the politics of it but here one is what i want you to know that the third world war cemetery is not happening now again that took away and i say that with confidence brothers i'll tell you this the reason always i'mma get a new video the armageddon is the third world war yes so really cathedral it will happen long after we are gone so don't worry about everything pressure some people even now have pressure i think i should now even save my colors are you with me sing with me now when they ready uh-huh oh what music oh are singing the city will be wrong when i redeem that oh my you're not singing louder i don't know why oh and everything where are we [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] give me the next stanza look at this there will be a great way wait i want about five people to come right here quickly right behind him okay he says and there will be all right begin moving the other side of god [Applause] [Music] will be wrong i wanted to sing that again he said oh what music music music includes hands clapping music includes you
