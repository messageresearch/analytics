I'm here to give you the report from our land fund contribution. This is week seven now and this is how we have contributed. Martin Luther contributed 400. My God bless you so much. Then he's followed by 237. Amen. Amen. Followed by by Paul 190,000. May God bless you so much. Then he's followed by William Branham. 160,000. My God bless you so much. Then is followed by Martin &gt;&gt; 100,000. God bless you so much members of Martin. Then he's followed by &gt;&gt; 65,000. Then John Wasley 45,000. &gt;&gt; My God bless you so much for your [Music] from the offering bag. We have 5,000. Amen. Amen. Then we have a total of 1 million 203,000. My God bless you. Uh from the seven weeks we have contributed 9 million 528,000 and God bless you. I have one reminder that this this phase two we are more organized than the first phase because the first phase we get we got some challenges most especially when we reach the time when the money is needed most of the money was not paid. And yet we had announced it even now some team leaders did not pay. I hope some people who pledged and they didn't pay the team leaders. So that's so this phase don't pledge if you don't have the money [Music] because for us we need the money late by Monday. We need to deposit it. If you know that you you don't have or you expecting to get next week then that week don't pledge just just give it the other week which you expect to get. So that will help us to get more organized because we make a lot of mistakes if the money does not come inside. So we end up paying what we are not supposed to pay. We pay on our money when when it is not when we find we have deficits. [Music] So may God bless you. Understand that. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Get on our feet. [Music] &gt;&gt; How many are expecting from the Lord this morning? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't forget what you expect is what you praise the Lord. I expect great from the Lord this morning. I believe you as well. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amina friend to you everything. Everything I give to you. Withholding nothing. Withholding nothing. Oh, withholding.

We'll just go straight uh right away at the slides. uh this I just want to first of all greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and also greet u thank you and also greet sister Millie where is she can we see her over there God bless you we greet you sister you're welcome thank you for coming to fellowship with us this Amen. &gt;&gt; And also I just wanted to mention I I I forgot unfortunately to give you the photos for that. I had I have a lot of things I'm going to show you today, but I forgot to uh organize the slides for the baptism. No, I mean like the baptism. We had a baptism service this week. &gt;&gt; Of course, you don't know because you were not there. &gt;&gt; So Hallelujah. So um uh where is uh the brethren who are baptized? Ah over here. God bless you. God bless you sister. Who else over there? God bless you. Amen. Uh praise God. And you know looks like the home sales are very busy and the Lord is really giving giving them souls. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we had a wonderful baptism service with the two sisters and I was so surprised to know that this sister has been fellowshipping with us for more than a year and I don't even know of her. But I'm so happy that you are finally baptized. I asked her why do you want to be baptized? She said she has had been many churches but when you know the time she spent attending here really she felt that we're preaching the truth here and uh you know sister it's not us it's the word and we are so grateful that God has given us the word in this hour and you know all the elect will come. Amen. All those who are predestinated to life, they will come. You are here. So you have your brothers and sisters still there. Let us believe the Lord will bring them in. Amen. And my precious sister here also you know was I think invited by brother Dickon Enoch in their home cell and um I'm happy to see that the Lord is dealing with our heart. Amen. So last Sunday we had an issue with the with the power and I could not be able to show you the uh the slides the Ethiopia mission report and um and I just wanted to do that today. So when I left here, can you give me the f the second slide? &gt;&gt; Um I don't know whether you all can see this. Okay. Is it possible for these lights to be off? &gt;&gt; If not possible, it's all right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Even if you remove everything. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's perfect. &gt;&gt; That's perfect. &gt;&gt; Yes. So now um we we I left um and I went to I went of course by road to the airport um and then from the airport in took a flight and um I should also mention that I did not have uh funds to go I never have funds to go whatever I do for the Lord. God just surprises me. And and so there's a brother who came and told me, you know, and you know, he had heard of me and um he was burdened to uh support me on my next trip to Ethiopia. So he bought all the tickets And that was quite amazing. [Applause] And that is how it was from day one. The first trip we took to Ethiopia, myself and my wife, someone bought it. And so has it ever been in on every trip. I I've never begged. I just mentioned here and you know the Lord somehow provides and lays a burden on somebody to provide. So just it shows you if God is in it he will supply. So we took a flight to um Adis Ababa &gt;&gt; which is the capital and from Adis we went to um you know we took another flight. I didn't even go out of the airport. just took another flight to Mckll which is in northern Ethiopia and um about 1 hour and a half and then from there you know the brothers came picked me up and um went by road to Adigrat. Adigrat is the little part you see there pointed right there. &gt;&gt; It's in it's one it's like almost the tip of Ethiopia. It's 100 kilometers from the Red Sea just down there. And so that's where we the first time we went here was in 2016. But my first time to go in this region was in 2015. And I'm you know I'm writing further reports you know the testimonies and on the website I will share that and many of you who want to get the details you'll be able to read. And so um that is where we went and we were able to meet the brothers. Uh we have a few people baptized in that area. No church yet they are the church. So the um um can I have the next slide? &gt;&gt; This is one of the brothers on the left here. &gt;&gt; Wonderful brother. His name is brother Binham and um his um his father was the first to believe some years ago and then he believed too and his entire family. Uh I should also mention that u uh you know there are other believers in the city of Mckel but at this present time there's no fellowship in that entire area and we were able to meet these other people are Pentecostal ministers. we were able to meet, you know, spend time meeting Pentecostal ministers and also meeting other um the brothers and you know, sharing with them and encouraging them and um you know, brother Okai while I was there, he disallowed me to pay my hotel and all the expenses. He's the father of brother Binium. He told me I'm hosting you here. You are not going to pay a dime. I told him I've not come to take. I've come to give. He said no. Not a chance. You you you know you came to us when we were in need. It's our time to give back. And so he paid all the hotels in in as in in that area, all the meals and um and on top of that you remember that it was announced 250,000 shillings. It's 10,000 bill of Ethiopia. He said this one take it to the land fund. We want to participate in that. And so I said God bless those brothers. and we pray that God gives them a ministry there and that's the desire. So we are trying to do translations and um planning on printing a lot of uh tracks so that we can go and distribute to the churches and in the contacts we have in that area. Please pray for um as you will seen in the written report which I will give I've lost about more than a million people in the recent war which was in that area. So almost everybody has lost either a friend or a brother and this family survived narrowly. The one that I'm working with So we thank God for protecting them. I I have a lot to say but because of time I will just rush through. Okay, give me the next slide that looks like a private jet. But anyways, it is a flight we took back to Adisaba and um then from Adisaba I took another flight to Hawasa. That's another city in the south. You remember when we were still in the other little place, we asked you to pray and uh we went there to Aasa and that's when a church was started there and because I remember it was during co we had about 30 baptized in one go and and you know a church started there. brother, a brother, one of the brothers, the first brothers that came to the Lord during the time. Uh, brother Tesa is the current pastor there. But in Awasa, we mainly working with brother Ephraim who had actually invited me to go and preach in the ministers conference and also preach to the people there. Shortly before I arrived there, you know, they had, you know, several floods in the country and um quite they even in the church they lost about 12 people. So it disorganized a lot of things. But nonetheless, still the work of God went on. Give me the next slide. I had about 12 people that were supposed to be baptized on on my arrival. end up just baptizing two of them and one of them he's is um she's a wife of a minister and that is me and brother Ephraim in the water give me the next slide and these are the people uh the the sisters that we are baptizing Pastor Ephra over there &gt;&gt; myself and one of the ministers in the church. Give me the next slide. So shortly after that we went to the minister's meeting. This was a Pentecostal gathering, ministers gathering and um you know brethren were happy to hear the word and um I do not know okay the picture is a little small but you see this brother here uh is there's a nethopan brother that has come here recently. And that is his father. He's one of the ministers that the Pentecostal ministers that came to the Lord. Brother Ephraim has been with him for quite a while sharing with him. And so in this meeting I shared the word and I told them of course I spoke a lot of things but then when it reached on water baptism I told him I have an offer after preaching everything. After teaching everything, I gave an offer. I said, I have I'm going to look for 1 million billion and I'll give it to anybody among you here that will show me one person that was ever baptized in any other way but in the name of the Lord. Oh, just show me one person who was baptized in father son and I'll give you the one. So that brother went and searched. He told me he was searching for for about a day or two and uh he could not find it. So he came back and he said, "I've come now so you can now teach me properly so I can understand. which is the correct water buffer. So together with pastor Ephraim we shared with him and went into the details and you know he's a minister he has a group following him he's ministering to and so he was really moved and he tried to dodge it he said maybe next time we'll talk but I say what do you say he said it is in the word but I have more I said I'm here bring the question. So we went again into the word and then finally he said now I have seen it and he said what hinders me to be baptized [Music] and I said if you believe with all your heart I'll baptize you. He say, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God." Well, that sounds like something in the Bible. And and we quickly, you know, you know, we I I even had to, you know, we had to arrange some clothes and give me the next slide. And right there it was night time around 7:30 and we baptized him &gt;&gt; in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Isn't that wonderful? Amen. You give me the next slide. So this is the minister's meeting that we had in Pastor Ephra's church. Um, give me the next slide. I don't know how that came through. There were several other pictures. Uh, okay. Give me the next slide. There is the church there. &gt;&gt; Okay. Give me the next slide. Uh, no. No. Go back. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is the Sunday meetings. &gt;&gt; Sunday service. &gt;&gt; We had to have two services. But you know we we we we we only had one because of of the other meetings we were supposed to have and my limited time. So the the ministers who had traveled they came to me. How can you leave us like that? Let us at least have another service. It really broke my heart. I felt like we wish we had more time and so but we had a wonderful service. Pastor Ephraim has really done a good work there. Let's go to the next slide and that is um fellowship with the some of the ministers there. This is pastor Tesa the one who is now pastor in the first church in this brother &gt;&gt; who also started another new work in Adis Ababa. He came to Aasa for fellowship and that's pastor and so after that the following day. [Music] &gt;&gt; Can I have the next slide brother? There is a fellowship with other ministers. So these other ministers they came they said no we want to have more and those are all Pentecostal ministers there. And then the others are ministers with pastor Ephra. &gt;&gt; And we really pounded on the word. But we will just wait to see the future that will come which will come. Amen. Give me the next. So then after this we had to fly back to Adis Ababa. And before I I I go to Adis, I should say we we really had a wonderful time in our and with the saints there. Pastor Ephra and his family, his wife cooked us a very good meal. His wife is a Ugandan. So I had um a chance to eat some port. She she really took good care of us. Amen. And and uh pastor Ephraim &gt;&gt; sent his greetings &gt;&gt; to the church. &gt;&gt; Um so this is now Adisaba. &gt;&gt; Um uh you already know the one in the middle but the other brother his name is brother Habtom. when I was still a pastor in Addis, he was introduced to me by brother Giri and brother Habtom, you know, also comes from Tigra but you know living in Addis at a time at that time and this brother currently moved to Canada in in the Ontario area &gt;&gt; and has Actually, I want I want you to pray because he has asked me to come. He's um he's um he he's um you know ministering among the Pentecostals. [Music] He's ministering to them. is introducing the message to him and he has asked me to if it is possible to go and help him you know talk to some of his friends and the minister Pentecostal ministers there and uh you you pray about it because the Lord willing next month I'm planning on doing that and he was the very first one that we wed in the country He and his wife, Sister Yis, right? &gt;&gt; Of course, you did not hear her Ethiopian name. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you you pray over that. You see that flower behind there that was it was a new year in Ethiopia. You know, there are seven years behind our calendar. So they use their Ethiopian color. Ethiopia. &gt;&gt; Can I have the next uh slide? So then this is the Adisaba fellowship of brother. We also had some good time with the believers there and uh as we spoke to them. Um give me the next slide. And then that is brother Giri &gt;&gt; and his wife Sister Yodit. &gt;&gt; They just had a new baby. &gt;&gt; So I I said I have to visit them and you know this sister. She was very instrumental [Music] in all the testimonies you are seeing. She was the first to believe actually the second after the one brother and she turned out to be very instrumental. which was my first interpreter in Ethiopia and he and her husband are now working with VGR but they they are really they were very they're like pillars in Ethiopia and can I have the last that is me and sister sister Y's baby [Music] at at their home and I felt like a grandfather. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Well, I thought that is good for you to see. &gt;&gt; Amen. But maybe you want to put back. Amen. The Lord is really doing good things and we should keep those believers in prayers. There's a lot of work to do in Ethiopia. And um we are trying to uh do a lot and help in a lot especially in the southern area and the northern area. So would you remember to pray? Amen. Praise God. How many are ready for the word? Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, uh if you're ready for the word, stand with me and uh we are going to read from um and I hope today I get done with this subject of the narrow way. But let us read again Matthew for just our reading chapter 7 vers 13 and 14. Enter ye in at the straight gate, for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadth to destruction, and many there be which go in there. Because straight is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadth unto life, and few there be that find it. Shall we pray? Lord Jesus, may you please help me that Lord, the things you've laid on my heart, I'll be able to not stand in the way of your spirit speaking to your people. Let me lose myself, lose my mind that Lord, you will just come and take over, take me aside. even my brother who is interpreting. May we all get into the realm of revelation. Also help the people that are have come and others streaming this service and their desire is to hear from you. Lord, may you take us all aside. May they also enter into the realm of revelation and may we hear from you. Help us to concentrate. Help us to uh Lord not be distracted by anything. May your holy spirit accomplish the purpose for which you have desired today. Lord I commit this service into Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated church. Um also before we get into the word this morning Please receive greetings from brother Polyup. He mentioned to me that he's going to be preaching in somewhere close to Islamabad this morning. He went to have fellowship with the with the brethren and he was quickly asked to preach. So uh it looks like God is trying to do something. So I told him, well, you're going there not only for school but for a purpose. So do you remember to pray for him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now I'm speaking on a narrow way this morning and I have uh I realize on Wednesday I realized that always on Wednesdays I have more liberty to preach. I don't know whether that is the right interpretation. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? So you interpret it. &gt;&gt; I usually have more liberty than on Sunday. [Music] All right. Amen. So, so you always have more liberty on on Wednesday than on Sunday because um I don't know the reason but I think I I could guess because on Wednesday people who come they have really sacrificed [Music] and they really are hungry for the Lord. So I've noticed even with food uh when you have a lot of appetite you enjoy the food more is that not so but if your appetite is low you don't enjoy the food that so we have a lot of people who are Sunday male they only read on Sunday. The Bible says you are written epistles read of all men. Don't appear to church only on Sunday. Is that an amen? Is this what I'm talking about? On on Wednesday, I don't struggle with people say say amen. before I even say something. They want to say amen because they already hungry. So don't only come to church on Sunday as a ritual. Try your best. Sacrifice your time. Sacrifice uh uh you know it's not easy. You have to make time. And anything you do out of sacrifice, you always get a blessing out of it. So now this morning, being that you are already here, please be here. Don't think about what you're going to do after here. You'll think about it later. I'm just a man, but I am a servant of God. If you are hungry and you're pulling from the Holy Spirit, he will use me to bless you this morning. And so I wanted to, you know, just stay with one mind in one accord. And I'm happy to see sister. She's not been here for a very long time. Sister, God bless you. Amen. The narrow way. Everybody tell your neighbor the narrow way. the narrow way, not the wide, the narrow way, the narrow way is what we're talking about. And this is the third service. And I'm hoping that today we will get done with it because I have more other inspirations to share with you. And so Jesus said that straight is the gate and wide is the gate. That um straight at okay he says that wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadth to destruction. And then he said you enter at the straight gate because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadth unto life. But few find it. Many times we want to take the way of the majority. But I I told you last time, God always works with and in the minority. God has never been in the majority. Never in history. Never in scripture, never any any time has God ever worked with the majority. By the way, that is the truth. God has always worked with the minority because, straight is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadth unto life. Can you go? One time we were in Nairobi &gt;&gt; and I was um going by the going at the to the um I think we're coming from the airport. Someone had picked me up a brother and we were driving to the city and um you know I I've given you the story before and as we were driving you know we reached somewhere close to the gate there were there different there are different ways different gates which would be clear to go through maybe about four lane. So, but everybody was going on the first one. So, we found a very long queue on the first one and all the other three were empty. So, the brother when he was arriving here, he looked around. He joined the long queue. I told him, "Why didn't you go where it is empty so we can go fast?" He said, "Well, everybody's coming here. There should be something in front." And that's how many people make decisions. You mean all these people are fools with God with and you know when we arrived in front there was no problem with the other gates but it's just how their brain how the brains of people function. They think if the majority are going somewhere it must be good. But now with spiritual things and please open your spiritual eyes as I speak with the spiritual things where wherever the majority go there must be a problem because God always works with the minority. I dare you to show me any scripture or any time in history where God dealt with the majority. God always deals with the minority because straight is the gap and narrow is the way which leadth unto life and few find it. I want to be among the few. The majority will always go through the wide gate. They will always go where everybody is saying. They will always believe what everybody's believing. I don't want to be in the majority. I don't want to believe something because everybody's believing it. I want to search the scriptures and I want to know and I want to be sure. The Bible says make your calling and election sure. Be sure what you're believing. Praise God. and and um you know our subject has been mainly you know taken out of Jude. &gt;&gt; You know Jude is was a brother of Jesus and um you know brother of James and he he gave he was warning us he warned the church of the false teachers. Of course, even after here, after this scripture in Matthew, when you go down, then it begins warning us of false prophet. You know, God never warned us of one true prophet. He warned us of the many false prophets. So, we are not worried about the one true prophet. We are worried about the many name. The many who are saying the same thing are the false ones and the one saying that a different thing from all of them is the right one. Hallelujah. I am not ashamed to say I believe the message of William Brham. Why? Because William Brham's message did not point me to William Brham pointed me to Christ the word. All the major preachers in our generation talk about William Brham and when they talk about him they say he was a mighty man of God. He was a mighty prophet. They agree that he was a prophet when he raised the dead. They agree he was a prophet when he healed the sick, when the lamb walked, when the blind saw. They agree was a prophet when the supernatural happened. But when it comes to the third phase of his ministry, all of them who agree he was a prophet now say he is a prophet. They say William Brham was a a true prophet and then he went astray at the end of his ministry. And then you ask them where did he go astray and they would say he told wrong things. One one of them said no because he he was a prophet not a teacher but he made himself a teacher. And then you know if you read if you're a good Bible reader to who does the word of God come to the word of God does not come to a teacher. It does not come to a a you know a pastor. It doesn't come to an evangelist. The word of God in a generation comes to a prophet. It is a prophet that receives the word and then gives it to the people in the generation. You read Amos 3:7, you will see it is the truth. God does nothing except he has sent a prophet in a generation. And then they say he went astray. And then you ask them where did he go astray? Oh, because he told that God is one. So how many gods do you believe? Oh, of course. Ah, we forgot they believe in three gods. So when William Bham preached one god, they were offended. He told that there is one god and is a spirit. And he was the Jehovah of the Old Testament. And the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the new. &gt;&gt; And they could not stomach about. But the few in this last day can receive them. Amen. Amen. They believe Jesus is the resurrection and the life. They believe he's the greater I am. Amen. They believe that Jesus, Amen, the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the new. &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe John 1, which says, "In the beginning was the word. The word was with God, and the word was God." Vers 14 says, "And the word was made manifest." Amen. God was made manifest. He put on flesh and was made manifest among us. So we believe one God and anybody who believes in one God is the true believer. And the ones who don't believe in one God, they they have gone so much astray that even the devil is shocked. Because the Bible says you believe in one God, thou doest well. Even the devils believe and they tremble. That's the Bible. Even the devils believe. people who don't believe in one god they even shock satan himself because Satan was there he didn't see three god he saw one god father son holy spirit and not three separate person it is the same god in three offices in three manifestation god above God with us, God in us, the same God. Jesus said, I go, "I will come back to you." Amen. I will be in you and with you. And then he said, I the father will will will send the comforter and the father will come. So who will come? Is it the spirit? Is it the father? Is it the son? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. is the same thing [Music] and people are confused. So we preach one god here. What a baptism in the name of our lord Jesus Christ. They don't believe it. They believe in all list of things that cannot be founded by the bible and they are the many and they are the majority. They have mega churches and you people think they are the right one. No, the right one has always been one and the first one have always been the many, the majority, one Elijah, 400 prophets of B. That's the God I believe. Amen. But you see we we don't believe blindly. Whatever we believe must be identified in the word. And the reason why I believed in the message of William Brham to be the truth because his message leads us to Christ. Not to an organization, not to an individual, not to himself. But he leads us to Christ. So we are the true Jesus people. Praise God. Now Jude goes ahead to explain that there are those who shall come teaching false things. He said they're filthy dreamers. They defile the flesh. They despise dominion and speak evil of Gintes. And on verses 11, he speaks of them this way. Why unto them? For they have gone in the way of Cain and read greatly after the era of Bam for reward and perished in the gain sayings of Kora. Praise God. And and you know the whole book I told you last Sunday that the whole book of Jude warns us about false teachers and ungodly men who creep into the church. Turning the grace of God into sin, denying the word, denying the Lord. you know, when you talk about and I was I had just talked about, you know, the you know what a cult is and I'm sure you now know what a cult is. A cult is anything that leads you to something else give that makes you to have devotion to something rather than Christ. That something can be a religion. You talk about my religion, we we separate. You talk about my political, we separate. You talk about my football club, we separate. You see, you talk about my man, my pastor, my prophet, my so and so, we separate. So their allegiance is with the thing more than Christ. &gt;&gt; That's why brother you must never let anything be beyond Christ in your heart. Christ and then anything else. Amen. Is is our absolute. Amen. And Christ is not something. He is the word. He's a person. Amen. And when you receive him, you will believe every word. And now Jude warns the believers of going against the word, false teachers. And then he gives us three examples which he has taken from the Old Testament. And one of them he says um that they went in in the way of Cain on Sunday last Sunday I spoke about the way of Kane. Uh you know the way of Cain represents false worship. What is false worship? It is religion instead of revelation. God is not looking for religion. God is looking for revelation. Cain had religion but Cain had no revelation. God is not looking for you giving something. God is not looking for you to join a church. God is not looking for you even to do anything. It is not about your works. None of our works can buy us salvation. Our works is just religion. We need to go beyond our work. &gt;&gt; And we go into the realm of revelation. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. God help me to show you this. You know when I say that it does not mean we will not do the good works. You know Jesus spoke to the people and he told them if your faith does not go beyond that of the Pharisees you see if you're following me say amen. What was the faith of the citizens? It was only embedded in the works they were doing. Are you following me? The works they were doing, washing hands, keeping Sabbath, not committing adultery, not not doing this, not lying. So those are the works. If you do those works very well, you are a good religious. [Music] And according to them, you will go to heaven as long as you keep all the rules of the religion. Now, here came a boy who had kept these rules from when he was a child and he asked Jesus. He said, "What must I do? to be saved. But what did Jesus tell him? &gt;&gt; Jesus told him, "Go and do the laws. You know them. Don't do not commit adultery. Not do not don't not you know, not all those ones." I'm sure the younger man was happy. He said, "Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I have done all of them. since I was a child. Did Jesus say, "Amen. Now you can go." No. He told him, "Yes, you have done all of them. But there is one more thing that you must do." So what is it? Go. Sell everything you have. Give to the poor. Come follow me. &gt;&gt; The man who was disappointed. Why? He never had revelation. He never understood what Jesus was saying. He wanted rules to do. But he didn't want to lose himself. Jesus was saying, "You have to receive me. You have to lose everything. You can't get me if you still have yourself. You have to die to yourself. Your desire, die to the world, your religion, to everything. Then and only then can you come and follow me. But the younger man did not have revelation to understand what Jesus meant. So he went away sad. No revelation but only a religion. Brethren, we must do things by revelation. You know in the Old Testament the Bible required this one may bite. So follow me closely. May God help me. The Bible required every believer to pay 10% out of his income to the Lord. Right? We call it tithe. It is a requirement of the law. Actually, even before the law, you remember Mo Abraham paid tithe, before the law of Moses, but even the requirement of the law was you must pay tithe and then you give offering. But you see in the New Testament, oh my, oh my, just just open your heart now. open your heart to especially to to those of you who don't pay tithe. You have not even become a Pharisee yet. Aar a good &gt;&gt; must be a serious sincere tithe payer and that's how they were in the Old Testament. That's to be a serious Pharisee meaning to be a good religious person. What God requires is not religion. He requires something higher than religion. [Music] Revelation. Amen. And so we notice that in the New Testament under the dispensation of the Holy Ghost, the believers in the book of Acts They would look at each other. This is brother Calb. This is brother. Bring all of you together. Brother, you have how many cows? 10. Okay. You You have how many lands? 10 acres. You have what? A house. Okay. Now, brethren, let us agree by revelation we sell everything we have. Let us bring all the money together and we divide it equally among ourselves. Now the brothers who did not have revelation they like after all even the word does not say that the word says only 10%. This is our labor. The other sister is lazy. She doesn't even even the other brother they want to earn on our swear. So they went outside and they sold their land and they connived among themselves. Let us go and take tell them that this is what we saw. They sold 50 million. They brought only 10. After all in the Old Testament it was only 10%. And so they brought what they had sold according to what they had agreed the rest they kept. So they came in the church. It was the brother who came in first. You know he was one of the rich brothers in the church but he came late. Pastor Pastor Peter was already on the boat and he came late. He sat down. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Wait, brother. Is this what you have sold? Yes, pastor. Of course, that's what we sold. Praise God. He said, "You have not deceived me. You have deceived the Holy Spirit." Before he even finished speaking, the man died physically. They carried him. I am talking about New Testament church. It must be beyond the law. Who killed this man? Under the law, they would stone you. But under the holy ghost, it is God to work on you. And and here the man he was buried. I don't know where the what the government did at that time. They buried him. Imagine a church killing someone and buried him. And sister came also with her high heels. Sister Safira. Yeah. God bless you, sir. &gt;&gt; She sat down. Sister Safira, &gt;&gt; is this what your husband brought? Is it all that you sold? Yes. Pastor said, "All right. The feet which carried your husband will carry you." &gt;&gt; Who was talking? A pastor, a man led by the Holy Ghost. My friends, don't play with the Holy Ghost. The law you can pray, but the Holy Ghost, don't play with it. That's why he said, "Touch not my anointing. Do my prophets know how? Because God fights for his own and you are his own. He will always fight for you. Whatever you speak, it's not you speaking. It's God speaking through you. That's the power of the Holy Ghost. And now today we are under the same grace. You are saying 10%. But even 10% you cannot pay. You are even worse than a far because a will be religious will fulfill that one. You will say how much? 10% only. If if my tithe is 5,000 100 he will make a sure he even gets a change of 100 ch so that it can be exactly 100 I have 500 I'm looking for change because I want to pay tithe so that he pays 5,100 that's a good religious If you are under the grace, you are not going to follow only the requirement of the law. You are going to give by what I'm teaching is a big principle. You are going to give not by religion not by the requirement of the law but you are going to give by revelation. Revelation sometimes you know revelation if it is something which has been revealed to you usually it is more than what you can do. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. I just told you a testimony of a brother in Ethiopia. They not doing well. But it was just a revelation. I have to do this and I let him do it because it was a revelation. You know, you hear needs in the church. I'm so going through this going through this. But he said me I've paid my tithe. That's enough. No revelation. But if you have revelation, you have something on the account, you will say, "Why can I keep this?" When my brother in the church is going through something, when my sister's going through something, let me do this for the sake of the kingdom of God. That's a man with revelation. Now in the New Testament, it says, "Give and it shall be given press down, shaken up." You know pastor you praying teach preaching about money. No I am getting revelation. Cain brought an offering. It was a good offering but Cain was done. Why they giving a sacrifice? This sacrifice was by revelation. You know you cannot give a sacrifice unless you have a revelation why you are giving that's the revelation why you are giving and received a revelation that I am giving blood because blood was mixed up somewhere. There is a blood that was mixed up somewhere and my brother Kane I don't know why I'm feeling that way but I know my brother Kane is of another seed blood that was mixed up somewhere and had a revelation in blood which will take away the sin may not be my blood may not be the blood of the animal but this blood of the animal will stand in for me who told that to Abel by revelation andel brought blood and when blood went before the throne of God [Music] said it smells The offering smells good because it was an offering out of revelation. &gt;&gt; Brethren, amen. &gt;&gt; If we as a church of Christ can do things by revelation, not by bandwagon, not by coping so and so coping the other way. But I am doing this because God has revealed it to me. I am sweeping the church because God has given me. I am playing instrument because God has I'm helping my brother because it is a revelation. I am singing and dancing to God. Everybody's doing it. It is a revelation from God. I am giving to land fund because it is a revelation. I am marrying sister Julia because it is a revelation. Are you hearing me? I am refusing so and so because it's a revelation rather let us walk by revelation taught us faith is a revelation and he said without fa without without faith that's what the Bible say without faith everybody repeat with me without faith it is to please God you can never please God without revelation. You can come to church. You can pay your tithe. You can dress well. You can sing well. You can do everything well. But if you have no spiritual revelation, God will never be pleased. And the true church of Jesus is not doing things by religion, but revelation. understood it say amen. &gt;&gt; Now Jude was warning the church about uh you know false prophets and he said these will go into the by the way of Cain. The way of Cain. What was the way of Cain? The way of Cain was serving God without revelation. Are you here this morning when you have been walking by the way of Cain? May God help you. May God save you. May God deliver you. Come out of the way of Cain. Walk in the way of Ab. Walk in the way of S. Walk in the way of revelation. Hallelujah. The Bible says by faith Moses by faith Sarah by faith Abra by faith by faith every man of God every woman of God walked by revelation. And the Bible say by faith Enoch he walked with God until he was no more. Where did he go? He was changed. He went into another dimension by revelation. Even as today, brethren, we are going to be changed by revelation. Hallelujah. You receive the Holy Ghost by revelation. You receive the word by revelation. You receive your theophony by revelation. You marry by revelation. Whatever you do, do by revelation. You cannot hate someone by revelation. So if you have one, if you have an enemy who is not certain, you have no revelation. It means we are very small. That means there is no revelation. Brethren, if you have an enemy who is not Satan, you need to be delivered. You need to be saved. You need to be born again. You need to receive a revelation because the Bible says, "Amen. Love one another, not as Cain, who was the son of the wicked. He did not love his brother killed him. Why? He had no revenge. But if you're a son of God, you will love everybody. I said you will love everybody. So if you have an enemy, if revelation has struck you right now become your your friends. Forgive them. I said forgive them. It's not me telling you. It's God speaking to you. Forgive your enemies. Love those who do bad to you. That's what Jesus told. And if Jesus is in your heart, you cannot have hatred. [Music] Me, that man, that woman, I will never. Oh brother, sister, may God change you. Oh, those of you who are behind, may God touch you. May you love every brother, even that one who slapped you. The Bible says, "Put another child, even the one who took your C. Give him another one." That's what Jesus taught. Am I teaching the Bible? Therefore, you must love your enemy. The way of Cain is a way of denomination whereby you don't love somebody because they are not doing what you're doing. But the way of Abel loves all brothers, loves all sisters. You know what? Abel knew Kane was of another seed. But even then, when Cain went to kill him, he did not hate him. He still loved him. He died loving. &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, love your brother. Love your enemies. Don't go in the way of Cain. Pastor, that is a hard saying. That's why it is a narrow way. Have you now understood? That is why it is a narrow way. It's not easy. How can you love your enemy? It is easy to love your brother, someone you agree with. But how can you love someone you disagree with? Let me tell you if but the Bible says if you can't if you can't disagree with somebody and you love them with all your heart there is something wrong with your experience. I can disagree with brother Omar here but still when I shake his hand I mean it with all my heart. Say father I love you about our disagreements. Many times time solves it. That's right. Many times time solves it. Maturity solves it. Imagine notice a child when you slap the child &gt;&gt; because they're doing something wrong and he says you are not my friend I don't like you like okay all right you know he's a younger child you're not my friend you say okay me I'm your friend you're not my friend don't like you because she's a child. It is circumstances that dictates who are friends. But a Christian, it is your nature that determines who are your friends. Hallelujah. Your nature, if it's a nature of God, you will love everybody. Jesus, he was being beaten in his heart. You were saying, "I love you. I'm dying for you. I'm your friend." And they nailed him on the cross to the time he was nailed. He loved them. And then this man was laughing at him. He's saying, "If you are who you say you are, save yourself and save us." But what did Jesus say? Amen. He said nothing. Amen. Why? Because he had already said for God so loved why that he gave his only beloved body his only beloved body. God gave his body to be persecuted to be beaten to be you know gone all through that thing because of love. If your love, Amen, doesn't make you love your enemy, you will have a problem with your Christian experience. A brother just does something or a sister does something from today. I will never talk to that person. Even let me block them from today. And you are here and you have blocked some brothers. some sisters and you are looking at me and you have done it and you are saying you a believer. Oh my God, you need an experience now. May God touch you right now. May God increase your experience. May he give you grace and experience and love in your heart. The Jesus in your heart will not make you love your enemy. My brother, my sister, you are in a wide way, not in a narrow way. May God help us. But what I just say to you right now is thus sayeth the word. Let us not go in the way of Cain. You know, I I spoke with somebody else and I told him how I disagreed with somebody else. Later on, they saw me with them. And I was hugging them, embracing them, and I thought it's your enemy. I said, "You misunderstood. I told you how I disagreed with you, but I did not tell you was my enemy. I can disagree with you but remain your brother and your friend. By the way, one time Paul was asked a question said, "What in your opinion is the greatest miracle that William Brham ever performed?" and he had done many miracles. He said the only greatest miracle that I can allude to is that you could not differentiate between his enemies and his friends. Think about it, brother Julian, that when someone looks at you, he knows you have enemies, meaning those who don't like you. Okay? Every one of us has people who don't like them. Oh, are you angels? You have people who don't like you. Those are your enemies. Supposedly had them. But if you looked at him, the way he related with people, you could not differentiate between his enemies and his friends. If you've not reached that level, you still have a long way to go. And that's why I'm preaching to you today, the narrow way. It's not easy. It's narrow. But you have to walk through it. It's the way to eternal life. And then he gave another example of Balam. I can talk about Cain. I don't know for how long. He gave another example of Balam. He said also Balam who was greatly in the area of Balam for reward. And he warned us not to go in the era of Balam for reward. You know Balam represents greed and compromise. A prophet who loved reward and tried to c Israel. Those who follow Balam are preachers who sell the word for money or for pure popularity. Now you listening to me church. Now I read for you Revelation 2:14, which say, "Because thou hast them there that hold a doctrine of Balam." Balam is interesting. Whenever you talk about Balam, he said, "Listen, this is Sunday morning. Let me finish this sermon today. So stay with me. Let's continue to learn this together. Because we want to be better Christian. I am done long time ago preaching sermons to make you happy. I want you to mature. I want us to grow in the Lord. Okay. So now, so listeners, we we learning this together now. You know the scripture says Balam, you know, he taught Balac, &gt;&gt; he told him how to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication. Now the way of balam is twofold. It is a way of idolatry and fornication. Mhm. &gt;&gt; This is another subject which can take a long time. But I have a little quote here that I'll read for you in Paman church age. After the sacrifice was made, Bam was ready to prophesy. But God tied his tongue and he could not cast them. He blessed them. God didn't have any respect for those Nicolantans. [Music] with their PhDs, PhDs, LLDS, DD, and all their fine organizations, and the best that man could bust. But he did have respect unto Israel, for they had the word vindicated among them. Suddenly, Israel didn't look too polished up. They had just come out of Egypt and the whole racket and everything. But you know she was free now. She was a blessed people through the sovereignty of God. Suddenly Moab looked down on her and all the other nations did too. You know you you are that little Israel today. The world may look down on you. The big churches may look down on you, but let me tell you, you are blessed of the Lord. When you walk in the narrow way, it doesn't matter what people's opinion is. What matters is what God thinks about you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I realized many times we want we worry about what people think about us and good men will be compromised. Good women will be compromised because they are fearing to see to not what people will think of them. Let me tell you brother sister be a man a woman of integrity. Do something because of what God thinks about you, not what your friend thinks about you, not what you whoever thinks about you. That doesn't matter. And here was Israel. They're going through Moab. I I told you that Moab was um you know they came out of the union of Lot and his daughter. You remember how it happened? I explained to you already. And so you know they they they got to and so Moab they gave birth to Moab and Moab became a big nation. There were so many. And as Israel was going through Moab, the land of Moab, they sent out a letter or message to the king of Moab, King Balac. Let us go through. If any of our men will eat something, we will pay. If anything happen, we will reimburse you. Let us go through in peace. But you know the prophet says these men, the men of God, we are under a revival. They were with a pill of fire, signs and wonders. God was in their midst. God was in their camp. King feared. If these ones go through, they may just take my people. Disallow them. He now went. He was so perturbed and he wanted to go to cast them. He went to hire a prophet called Balam so he can come and help him to cast them. He told him, "Prophet Balam, I will give you clothes. I will make your name great. I will increase your rank. I will make you the overseer, the the archbishop or whatever it is. Just do me one favor. Cast these people for me." Today we have a lot of balls. They have many titles. They have the DDS what have you. And people think because these men educated and they have you know big establishments. God must be with them. Remember my brother God is in the narrow way. Balam was so excited. He said, "All right, if there is some money, count me in. If you are here, brother, sister, and you will be quick to serve God for money, then you have a spirit of balam." &gt;&gt; That's the generation we are living in. We even have younger people who are supposed to be musicians. What do they do? They always go and um you know try and go somewhere where they will get some good money in the big churches. And these younger people will never sit in one church and be fed. They will hop from one church to another church. You you they come pray for you. Ah you enjoy your sing. The moment now they are inviting the preacher. Where are they going? To another church to play again for money. two musicians in this church. Anyone who ever does that, you will never be allowed to play here. &gt;&gt; Musicians, we believe you are gifted. But you must sit down and also be fed on the word. You must grow. We are not serving God for money. Even a preacher, we're not preaching for money. &gt;&gt; You see us traveling here, traveling there, brethren. If we wanted money, we had better opportunities in the big churches where we were. Some of us we were favored there. But my God is grace. He brought the message to us. So what is the thing? Amen. That is firing us up. Amen. It is the word, the truth. It is firing us up. Amen. That's why we speak many times as if we are dying. What is it? What do you think is the problem? It is something on our soul that is telling us preacher is a burden for soul. a burden for the truth. May God help us and keep us that way. But you see Balam, you know, desire to have the money and the power that came with. And so he tried his best to c Israel, but he could not cast Israel. That's why I believe the true people of God can never be cast. I can never be cast. Tell your neighbor, I can never be cast. I can never be cast. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I amable. I am beyond a curse. Why? Because I am a blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus. The Bible said they shall be a blessing in thy seed. Amen. I'll bless you. You know we are the seed of Abraham by faith in Christ. We are a blessing and the world is blessed because of us. When we leave this world, the tribulations will come down. The fire of God will come down. You are the grace of the world today. The world should watch out. The moment you are out of that, the tribulation will begin. But brother, sister, we are here not to be defeated. We are here to defeat Satan. We are here to overcome Satan. We cannot be cast. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And so Bam tried to cast them. He could not do it. &gt;&gt; He failed to find a way to cast them. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he tried to bring always looks down on the unorganized and either way by determination they bring them into an organization or they destroy them when they they won't come into the organization. the spirit of Balam. That's always the purpose. So Balam now said, "How am I going to do this one? Because I need this money. I need this money. I need it." You know what he did? He said, "I have an idea." So what's the idea? Let these people. If I can't cast them, I'll make their God cast them by them doing what their God doesn't like. I'll bring them into idolatry and fornication. You see, that's a tactic of the devil is the way of balam. You are so special in the hand of God. God can't c you. No one can c you. But the devil knows if you can leave your place. So Bam got Israel to fornication. And then brother Bam asks a question. Do you know that physical fornication is actually the very same spirit that lies in organiz or organized religion? I say that the spirit of fornication is the spirit of organization. And all fornicators will have their place in the lake of fire. Fire. May God save you from that. That is what God thinks of organization. That's also what God thinks of fornicators. And all fornicators will have their place in the lake of fire. Yes sir. The whole and her daughters will be in the lake of fire. Denominations are not of God. They never have been and never will be. It's a wrong spirit that separates the people of God into hierarchy and laty. A wrong spirit that separates the people from the people. You know we have arch deacon you know priest reverend bishop bishop pope cardinal whatever those kind of hierarchy are not of god you see spirit of denomination. It separates the people from the the hierarchy from the lady. Therefore along it makes you feel that the man of God is almost gone. you you are just here and that's why you have seen even in this country some people actually bowing to the men of God. Have you not seen it? What is it? spirit of organized religion is the same spirit of fornication, spirit of idolatry. You see, and the message has actually set us free from that. He said, "Come out of my people." You know, it separates the people from the people. That's what organizations and denominations do. In organizing they separate themselves from the word and they bring themselves into spiritual adultery. That is why they will follow their men even when their men leave the world. Brother, sister, we are not following blindly men. We are following men who are following Christ. That is the narrow way. Don't put your eyes on me. Don't put your eyes on your cardinal. Put your eyes on Christ. Don't put it on anybody else. Don't even put it on the prophet. Don't even put on the pastor because we are all men. We are all men and flesh and blood will not inherit the kingdom. But put your eyes on Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; is the word. Praise God. Let me show you something here. Um if you can put up Numbers 25. And as you are putting up numbers 25, someone read for me 1 Corinthians 10:7. Neither be ye idolattors as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat drink and rose up to play. Neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one dead three and 20,000. That is 1 Corinthians 10:7. [Music] So yeah, go ahead. Yes. Now if you want listen church listen if you want to follow this story in numbers the Bible here okay okay look when when you come here in first Corinthians all of you just look up here in 1 Corinthians 7 Paul is warning the Corinthians and is telling them don't be idolators and also don't foricate because if you do you are you are going to fall just like they fail he says 20 2300 they die and this is the New Testament he's quoting numbers 23 this is what happened in the story of of of Moab and and Balam and let us read it up to verses um somewhere there. Let us read numbers 251. And Israel abim brother you have the scripture up here. And Israel abim and the people began to commit wardom with the daughters of Moab. And they called the people unto the sacrifices of the go of their gods. And the people did eat and bowed their down to their gods. And Israel joined himself unto Balpia. And the angel of the Lord was kindled against Israel. I always believe you know like I was giving an example of musicians. If you're a musician or a singer or whatever and you go to serve on an altar that is not glorifying Christ You are doing idolatry. You're doing just idolatry because you are serving on false altars. That's true. I wish I could explain it more. And the children of Israel, they went into worship with Balpia rather, you know, the worship of and they went and joined together with the with the Moabites. We are not of them. We cannot be of them. You know the voice of this message, the voice of the angel says in our generation, come out of her my people. Be not partakers of many times you find yourself even on your TV, you are glued. What are you looking for there? Can I prophesy? Can I prophesy? Can I prophesy? And some of you are watching those kind. And when you come here DVF, you feel bored. But pastor does not prophesy, prophesy. You are going there fornicating spiritually. And that's not your food. Your food is the word. You need to feed on the right kind of food. You need to filter what you listen to. &gt;&gt; Not everything is a food. Not everything is ego food. We are eos. Hallelujah. Am I preaching to believers here today? We are eos. Feed on the word. On the word, on the word, on the word. Oh pastor, I don't believe in the supernatural. The Bible says the son shall follow them that believe. It should follow you as an individual. Amen. Hallelujah. How many have seen supernatural in their lives here? Raise up your hand. Look at all these hands. If you've not seen supernatural, the problem is with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; But supernatural follows the believers every day of their life until we are changed. But the path we are going is not as easy as you think it is. It is difficult. It is narrow. I'm sorry if you don't like it. But those who like it, you will receive eternal life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; See here they went in and and and began committing wardom with the daughters of Moab and they called you know even this kind of parties. Can you imagine imagine a believer a younger man going to parties with a non-believer. By the way, can I talk about this? It's okay. Talk about it. I hope all of you will not leave the church. And those of you who are dozing, come in. Stand inside. Deacons. Bring them in. I want them to hear. You know, the devil is very wise. The younger men, he makes them do when they're going to hear things which will help. Make sure everybody's inside. So you see here when we talk about parties you find a believers are not supposed to go on parties of nonbeliever as long as I always tell them my family invite me as long as you're not going to play worldly music. And there is no alcohol. That is if I have time I'll come. That's the truth. Me a believer. Yeah. How how would you how would you think of me? &gt;&gt; If you found me because it's my relative invited me to to to go to the party relative. No problem. So you go. Then they begin drinking alcohol. And then you pastor they give you soda. This one is pastor. Even you they will call you pastor because you know these days they call pastor. Everybody who is a Christian is pastor. Give them. And then now after that then they the way they dressed you you went in as a very younger holy brother you know who's filled with the spirit and they begin removing all the spirit out of you the way they dressed you begin to become lustful in your mind you begin to look around and then all of a sudden they're dancing saying brother come just for a moment So you are saying but you are there also and then before you know it you know you're beginning to shake you before you know it you know you say it's okay I can stand after all I'm not squeezing like them I'm just this side a brother a sister &gt;&gt; which music are you dancing to by the way by dancing to worldly music. It is idolatry. The spirit of balam has entered you pastor. That is very hard. It is the narrow way. Christianity is the narrow way. Praise God. He said that is so hard for younger people. Are you the only one who is young? There are others who are young in your generation and they are not doing what you're doing which means you too can be delivered from it. You know that's what happened here believers went to parties of non-believers that's why even on our parties on our parties we should not compromise oh brother your wedding very soon yes don't compromise always by the way when you're planning brethren whenever you plan to have a wedding or any party you as a believer you Select your music. Select your music. Whatever DJ you hire, that's okay. Give him that music. Tell him if you play anything different. I will not pay you. And your friends who are worldly, let them come to a believer. Let them see how we do it. We can also be happy with our music. Hallelujah. Amen. We have good music also. &gt;&gt; Oh, he has done it again. You know, and we dance and we we are happy. &gt;&gt; We don't need the worldly music. We don't need worldly music. We should have our own music. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. You control, have dominion on your own parties. And when they invite you to their parties, well, go as long as there is no alcohol and and and beer parties and you know those kind of music. Praise God. What we have is very important. We should guard it with our life. You cannot on Saturday you cannot go to a beer party and on Sunday you come here and you don't do there are many spirits fighting you even find some believers going to go to bust &gt;&gt; I don't know how they call in English &gt;&gt; busting We don't know how they call it. Anyways, a believer shouldn't go on such on such things. You know, it is it is Jesus who did that on the cross and people go there, they begin vulgar words and doing some traditional kind of things and you you are also among them. May God have mercy. These things I'm speaking about are very important brethren. And and when when when this man saw there is no way he can catch them. He say I will take them in the parties with Moab. Many of them are young people. They will like it. So you find brother David sister. They are there. And I said brother David because it's a Jewish name. Now there might be a David here. Oh brother and sister. Oh brother whatever. What's your name? Whatever. Sometimes we speak names and you know someone can be offended and you find them there. They were there at that time. So they began dancing and you know there is something about alcohol and music it has the same spirit. &gt;&gt; Alcohol will make you do what you can you would not do ordinarily. Music will make you behave the way you would not behave normally cuz those things touch your spirit. So they went there and they were drunk and the music and the alcohol and the Sunday. So they began doing dancing in a funny way. These are people who are who who had gone through the pit of fire. seen God. They seen miracles. They were moving with Moses, a prophet and God. Oh, the Holy Ghost was with them. But as they were moving, they couldn't cast them. Hallelujah. But now when when they took them in that scenario, they defeated them. They started also enjoying. You know I always see when we are moving somewhere and where is El is he here you know he's there listening sometimes you know we listen to music one time as music came on he said daddy is that good song I said no okay but that's how the body is you see Even if you're a believer, you have the body. You cannot claim your body doesn't like it. And you know when you are singing a Christian song, you know, you will dance in a certain way. But those worldly songs are very songs. They will make you remove your the devil in you. And then before you know it, You are dancing in a way and you're shaking yourself. &gt;&gt; What's happening? Something which has have been awakened. And these believers, they did not plan. But before they knew it, they had began pairing, pairing, pairing. Do you know how many? 23,000 people and God knocked out one by one, one by one send the spirit of death die 23 and he was still continuing. But there was a brother who had a zeal of the Lord. His name was Finance. He quickly ran Because there was a brother who came and and you had a more crowd and they were laughing laughing and they even came before Moses and before the congregation trying to make you know their kind of funny kind of love and you know passing by and as they were going in the other room you know there was a man this younger man I laughed Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Fin came out. Amen. and he picked a javelin and he quickly ran to this brother and he pierced his back and and and you know the javelin went through even the woman and they died and the anger of God was quenched and God told Moses if it was not for that I would have finished everybody. Let me tell you if God hates something, God hates fornication and God hates idolatry. If you go to idolatry, if you go to you going to idolatry. If you go to funerals, you are going into idolatry. &gt;&gt; No my brother, not funerals, my brother. You have to interpret it properly. It is not a funeral. funeral busting. Whatever it is, &gt;&gt; you know that's idolatry. &gt;&gt; Praise God. We are born again. This is the old time salvation. This is a narrow way. Hallelujah. Amen. That they will invite you, I'm sorry, I don't attend such parties. We are also Christians. I'm a different Christian. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, as I'm finishing this part here, uh, you know, I think I'll just spare you because they also, brother, they need to make some announcements on the youth cup and everything. So, I'll just finish with this part and then maybe on I will speak on it on Wednesday. See, I want you to see the scripture in Revelation 17. If you can turn, &gt;&gt; Revelation 17. &gt;&gt; And there came one of the seven angels, which had seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come, I will show unto thee the judgment of the great war that sitth upon many waters, with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns. And a woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls and having golden a golden cup in her hand uh full of abominations and filthiness of our fornication. And upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery, Babylon the Great, the mother of harotss and abominations of the earth. Well, you can read it for the people slowly. Amen. Praise God. And uh you know the Bible speaks about mystery Babylon. This is a big subject and we can talk about it maybe in the sometime in the future some something on this line. You know Bible talks about this war mother of harot. Who is she? The great war. You know this is a church system. The biggest and the first the Roman Catholic system. Why does the Bible call her a great war? Because she she has a wine of fornication. She has made many get drunk in the wine of her fornication. What is it? Wrong doctrine, wrong worship, believing wrong teachings that are not in the Bible, believing you can pray to a dead person, believing in novenas, believing in all those things, scapulas. Oh, if you take a scapul, we you will go to purgatory until you pray through you know and you know they have replaced everything in the Bible their own traditions and ideas it's a big system huge church system church system she claims to be the one speaking on behalf of God that's why she's called Catherine Catholic means worldwide. So Catholic church means worldwide church. They believe they are the one true church. You know, you know in the apostles creed which they sing they say and I believe in the holy Catholic church. That's what we used to be sing or the angry can sing it to because they are the daughters. They are the ones that the Bible saying they are they are, you know, they are the daughters because she's the mother. They are the daughters. [Music] Now when you read it, you can't understand if you are can these are spiritual things. The Bible say that this woman was drunken with the blood of the saint. They they killed millions of Christians, fed them to liars when they refused to believe their false. The man who translated the KJV was killed by them because he translated the Bible. They said no one can read the Bible. You know many many things happened during the day in the dark ages. They introduced the trinity doctrine to replace the one God of the Bible. And you know this was all pagan ideas, pagan gods, pagan teachings because Rome has never been a Christian nation. Especially to those of you who have read history. You know, Rome existed before Christianity. It was one of the last last empires. But the Bible says, you see, when when when she got a wound, she became wounded and then later she revived. Listen, she was a a an empire political but now revived as papa Rome. There is no political leader in Rome is the papa. He has influence all over the world. Every American president almost like a a mass they have to go to Vatican. They own the wealth of the world decked with gold and precious stones and and you know uh pearls and they have a golden cup she has in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her. What is it? The wrong teachings, the wrong ideas, the wrong you know sacraments and things which are not and many are drunk from that car. If you tell them that they are wrong, they can almost kill. They killed millions of Christians. And you know what the Bible prophesies of the new world order that is coming friends. The mark of the beast is real. But the bride won't be here. She'll be long gone. That's why we are preaching the word. Amen. For us to know who we are. Where we are blessed in the word. But we do not go in the way of balam. One time I'll get it into details and speak to you on mystery Bible. But friends, the narrow way is the hard way, but it's the right way. May God help you to walk in the narrow. God bless you. Maybe you may be. Amen. Sorry, I took a little more time. But I hope that that was good for your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. [Music] God sent his son. [Music] They call him Jesus. Yes. &gt;&gt; He came to love. &gt;&gt; Heal and forgive [Music] and die [Music] to by my power. An empty grave is there to prove my savior. Sing [Music] it everybody. I confess tomorrow because all fear is gone. Oh, because I know. Yes, I know. Lord my future.

I confess to God because he my fear is because I know because I know I know my life is and the living just because he [Music] amen because we have some other meeting. Let us pray and close. If you have any need, I'd like you to make it known to the Lord by an uplifted [Music] and let us pray together. Lord Jesus, creator of heaven and earth, we come before you this afternoon. [Music] &gt;&gt; I want to thank you for the opportunity you have given to us to share your word. We do not take it for granted that we can still speak the word with liberty and speak by conviction and speak the truth. For the time is coming when it will no longer be possible. But as you have given us the grace, Lord, may you also give the grace to the hearers that Lord will be able to stand with the word. We'll be able to receive and believe the word. We'll be able to hold on to the word that we will be perfected. Father Lord, we know that you said in the book of Ephesians. You said the five-fold ministry. Preach the word for the perfection. May you perfect us Lord in Christ. And father Lord if there be any need Lord spiritual or otherwise Lord may you come and meet every need. You see the hands that have been lifted up. you know the needs oh God in their hearts. May you glorify your name. May you magnify your name that they may know you are a living God and you never fail. Father we thank you because we know that it has already been done by eyes of faith. We give you glory, honor, adoration Lord in Jesus name be with us this week now. in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. You may be seated at church. Um we we just have um one brother who if you could please stay for I'm going to limit them. I'm going to be right here. So I'll limit them. I I will not it will not go beyond 30 minutes. &gt;&gt; Brother Martin, I think for about 5 minutes. Where is he? He has a few announcements that he's going to make. And um I I think we'll not need to stream this part brothers unless if you think it is very necessary. So but maybe I just wanted to say as the brother Isaac will be giving us updates of the youth camp. I want us to know that uh you know you notice we have not even announced so much. We will but not as we usually do because we are trying to avoid getting a bigger number because we the venue we have is small. Um the hall can only have maybe how many did we have in there brother Isaac last time? Brother Martin 500. Yeah we had about 500 there. I understand. Yeah. 5 5 550. So, and and I think it was almost 600 and many were outside. body welcome.
