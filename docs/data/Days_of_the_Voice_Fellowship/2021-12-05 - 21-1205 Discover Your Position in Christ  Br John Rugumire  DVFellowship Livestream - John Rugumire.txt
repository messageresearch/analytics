come down that thou might might see the battle and David say what have I night what have I now done is therea is there no cause may God add the blessings amen we may SE I pray that the Lord anoints me that I may preacha amen this was David the David we talking about but my subject is discover your position in Christ and if God has put in your position no one can take you out of the place if the

represent the fivefold Ministries these fivefold Ministries they work together Pastor the pastor evangelist the Evangelist Apostle the Apostle Prophet the prophet and teacher and the teacher they must work together now the scenario that was taking place in the St it was the stones were praying for each other and they were saying today who should we send is going to let us send the P if he doesn't

tared tar him and beat him in the Forefront the man died what he came as a Vicor let me tell you brother learn from David discover your position in your in is depending on you the times we are in God is depending on you because all of us know we are at the end time uhhuh the dead must raise but do you know it is the bride that must resurrect you have not yet your you have not stood in your position you are still in sin you are not yet prayerful enough you have not repented enough you have not so for the Holy Spirit you mind more to your you mind your businesses you money more brought you here no we are not bu people are not people if we need money but we are not here for money we are here to build the kingdom of God amen amen yes we need the money the ministry needs money but the Maj thing is those who need money are they holy we need money but those who need money are they ho can God trust you withy are you Faith are you honest I remember certain quot brother says people Ser God and they are humble when they are poor and serving God they are humble if they have nothing they can pray they can fast because they have no other option a child can get sick after getting sick and they don't have money what they have to do goes to the knees now when God gives you money every disease you want medic you have a doctor I'm not disputing that please you say why do I need God so you become like the you know what the say I have cows even is that money turns human heart pleas if God gives you money pray [Music] go deeper in the spirit if you don't want that money to take you to Hell after all you are going to account for whatever came into your hands how you how youze this are we together don't be like the so that is why receive this message that you see you know such kind of attitude cannot welcome God yes is brother that is why brother Bram says that many chosen hey the most elected people are in pantry such that you will now let us give an example if God right now starts from me to give all of us 10 Millions starts [Laughter] on let us continue do you know that on wedes the can stand here and he reaches when nobody is in the church if you get 10 million today hello Sister Sister you have not been in the service you know was the business the money is too much has blessed [Applause] me Sunday wait on suay even on Sunday they will not come God rather leave you poor when you serving him I always tell people that if you're not faithful do you know what God will do to you promise to take care of you but the way he's going take care of you he will give you money for be of [Applause] beans gives you 1 to buy water and to buy Sal he even gives you power to pray when you're going to eat portion beans yes yeah us our daily faithful you will not get you will not get complicated diseases yes because he know he don't have will make your child from Malia no money you will just KNE down you PR you know God will take away all those you the issue might be want you to pray for the child now when you go to pray for the child forgive my sin by the time you come back you remember you didn't pray for the child I have you I have you now my I am there in the I will give him another he will keep you you know what to do because one day he gave you money and you were not in the service you didn't fast you didn't pray by the time you leave prayers the child is healed without even praying for the child because that is what God wanted I speak that with experience theor said that's very [Music] true he will give you money for rent but it will not be cash as they chase you out of the house that is when he Mir expecting the V people know when I come to to make money they expecting me to go back with money but they don't know what you're going through I'm not saying this to make you to no but it might be the truth the truth a real truth not for [Music] Orly no forame my pray shall be gladly will I to and [Music] suffer but only me with would be each one's prayer here you don't love God because of the good things he has given you you love him even for the B he has given you because he knows you manage them you know the Bible says that he rebukes a child [Music] he tastes the most beloved child now think about it I'm suffering I'm sick I'm poor but God is glad I'm like yes he tries you because he loves you in all that we must stand we must stand for God we must stand for the must stand for the goel must stand for everything is there no cause for me to be here God is Army that it will be challenged when I'm standing there is a there is a cause because God's Church cannot fall when you're standing there the ministry cannot fa when you're standing for you are still young you are not young you are old because God has trusted you you can challeng the situation when you such a situation keep quiet speak up you get up up you get up rebuke it let them speak what they want but be faithful re for not you are see and you no maybe if you're

need to stand brother sister there is a cause there is a cause there is a cause my brother my sister for that cause your amen amen we have many examples in the Bible there are people who could not bow the idols look at SRA [Music] and they were boys were young men there were youth the prophet says God cannot cannot miss to have a witness in the world yes he cannot fail to have a witness in the world praise God Amen now those men the the document came up and they said all of you you must bow to this image but what did they do what did they do ladies and gentlemen they said it is impossible they went and stood before the king and they told him Emperor we have heard the decree but we cannot do that we know you can destroy us we even see the fire Our God can save us even he doesn't save us does us we are ready to die we are ready to seal Our Testimony with blood rather die we' rather die to Idol be your decision you rather die to Idols to ID yes rather be killed you'd rather be killed and go to heaven that's a decision of a real believer who knows his position in Christ who know what he has believed who knows what he's following amen amen we know where we are going and we are sure anded he us amen amen I love those boys you're not standing before an emperor you stand before and tell him we shall not bow if you want to kill us us if you to save us save us can save us still can leave us die but now that situation a situation can become like that King that Emperor but you must not bow anything that fights God it is an image brother says even money can become an image a wife can be an image bus be an image meaning you must balance that God takes the first andom people seek other things but when you get other things before you get godom you cannot get the kingom first get

somebody is me amen amen is you is brother Jo brother Jo hallelujah amen and this says today I want to be baptized amen GL amen glory and he says I came when I'm prepared hallelujah amen that's what we believe I I think this young man has something to do in common with me when I had the message Mage I wanted to first know what is what are this people about Dido he Wasing at somewhere so uh one day we um whenever he go there we I always want to give him time you know so one of these days he came and said I always ask him what are your questions so then that day he said I have only one question always say this what say brother asked a good question and we started learning about the five comings of Elijah maybe there might be someone here else who does not even know please when we say read these books read it have a question come sh the word all this B back we go back to the scriptures and so uh we did share that and I will not go the details the day were talking about baptism remember remember the time we called his former Pastor I think heed in the name of Jesus Christ him and he asked him come up and us how here my name isly so we called him and he was like I B you in the name of the father Lord in the name of the of the Father Son and the Holy Spirit and actually scripture in Matthew yeah I think you know it so that's what matthew8 yeah that one so when we talked about when we talked about it with pastor pastor was like that's that's not what we were talking about and I today decided to do to to say thanks to the Lord because now I know the truth amen amen amen and uh he actually when we call his Pastor he said yeah in the name of Father Son and Holy Spirit and that's the only way and actually I said I think those are those things are the same so we were like sure these are titles and these are names so but as we had brother John preach in this church we don't only preach bapm not amen yes that is just element Bible truth the beginning leaving the foundation on perfection this message is perfection the for the Rapture amen amen so if there is another one maybe been baptized before but not in that name you have to Beed because what you did then was by dipping in water they just said father there is there is no difference between you and a Catholic because they all don't have the understanding of the name but there are people in this world who were the ones that wrote the book of act Apostles and we are part of them We are following them who were the people of the name they persecuted them because of the name and what is that name
