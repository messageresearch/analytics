You want you want to hear a testimony right now? I have a testimony to share with you. Uh when I went back to to the room by you know my wife just had a baby. We just had a baby and uh so uh she's just more or less staying in the room. And so when I I went there, she shared a testimony with me. We have a brother in the church. His name is Brother Brian. &gt;&gt; And this brother together with his wife for now a few years. They've been having, you know, children and losing them during child birth. And so this brother came this night to the camp and and um you know he was because he was a little late he was turned away by you know pastor Maher preached and he said this is the place of our anointing and so well but they had stepped already here and so they were turned away But after stepping here and so as soon as they were turned away, they went and had their baby. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so successful child birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I kind of think that they came here to be anointed for the sister to be anointed for the child birth then where and so uh when I checked the brother I found a text he said pastor we we we received a bouncing baby girl. So whatever your problem is this is the PLACE OF YOUR ANOINTING. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You are not going TO WALK AWAY THE SAME WAY YOU ARE. AMEN. These men are word power packed. That word is not going to leave you the same. And this morning, we in for another wonderful gastronomical journey. How many appreciate Pastor M. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. you know after he ministers this come you know I'm sending him to Nairobi and now I'm beginning to feel jealousy because brother Tasha was there for a few weeks and now he came here they sent him to us almost used up but anyways now pastor Michael is going to Nairobi also after is meeting. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know the Nairobi team, you're very happy and so but I thought we should stay with you for a little longer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know these chairs here then they've been mostly free. If the deacons can get the those of the Kenyan team, you paid a lot to be here. If you can come here this side, this chair should not be free. Yeah, the deacons can help help me and get if you came from Nairobi, come and tap the anointing. And if you're a Ugandan and a Kenyan comes, just step back. Step back in a good spirit. Amen. If a Uganda and a Kenyan comes, please step back in. Praise the Lord. There are more coming. So, I don't know if there are more chairs. &gt;&gt; Yeah, the little children can also. And I think we have one or two or three more. Okay. Praise the Lord. And I think I love this song. &gt;&gt; It's a very good theme for these meetings. So we're going to sing it again. As pastor Mike, you have all the time. Amen. And and so all the way to midday if you want to preach one hour, two hours. Amen. Let us sing what's your need. usually don't want to come to the camp and they want to stream. This time it's not really good for them. We are in an election season. I want to think that also as much as there are issues here at the venue but I think that that has also affected and so our streaming I don't know if it has been restored but hasn't been there what's your need what's your cry what's your mountain speak the word by and by the mountain will move if it doesn't move you to fly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch your knees.

It's my praise. Set your wings to wind. &gt;&gt; Let the weak say I am strong. And let the poor say I am free. &gt;&gt; Let the voice say. &gt;&gt; It's what the Lord has done for me. Ohana Jesus Hana Jesus into I s away from my free love. Heat. Heat. Hosanana Jesusana to the lamb that was slain. Hana Jesus died and rose again. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord somebody. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Merciful Jesus. Amen. I would like to greet you all in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Certainly deem it a grand private a privilege to be here this morning. And I'll start by appreciating by appreciating all of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Because a convention is not a convention convention &gt;&gt; without your presence, &gt;&gt; without your prayers, &gt;&gt; without your sacrifices with without you. Each one coming with your own leak of fire so that we can create this atmosphere. &gt;&gt; And I want to say to you, don't wait for anything. Just when you feel like it, just receive your blessing. If you have a burden, just put it down. This is that atmosphere where in all things are possible. Don't wait until you feel like there's water that's been poured on you or maybe you start to feel like you're having goosebumps. just have a blessed assurance that the presence of the Lord is here. And take advantage of his presence. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I just want to appreciate uh brother Bas. I don't know if that's what you call him here. We prefer to call him that. Pastor Talma. &gt;&gt; Uh our host. Our host. he's hosting and certainly appreciate his invitation to come. Amen. Praise the Lord. And I want to appreciate all the ministering brothers and all the pastors. I'll pay a special salute to my fellow speakers, Brother Josh Walker. I know the concept of time and distance in Australia is a bit strange sometimes. Me and brother Josh though we are coming from the same country but we are about 4 and a half hours 5 hours apart by flight. So he's right on the eastern coast of the Australian continent and I'm right on the western tip of the of the Australian continent. And I'm sure you can tell from my accent that I was not born and raised there. I'm not saying amen. I was born and raised in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe. Amen. Amen. And we share the same kind of spiritual upbringing with Rev Te. When I look in there, when I look in the audience &gt;&gt; and I see all the black hair and brown brown eyes, I'm home. I'm home. Praise the Lord. I'm Even when I landed in Johannesburg, &gt;&gt; just setting foot on the African continent, &gt;&gt; I felt like home. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then uh day before yesterday I uh obviously for security reasons there was a bit of a concern but we wanted to just go into campala and brother Martin and brother Joshua made that possible brother brother Martin and brother Joshua made it possible. So we took a walk around the city and went into the underbelly of the city. I felt like I was at home. So my mother's tongue being sha. It's a banto language. So I can't understand what you're saying, but I can connect to what you are saying. because all these and all these languages are all very closely related. Praise the Lord. So I just want you to know that I'm home. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But uh having said that, I will go straight into the word. How many are under expectation? Amen. We the Lord doing something for us. So we are not leaving the book of Luke. Let us revisit the book of Luke chapter 10. Praise the Lord. Luke chapter 10 and we start from verse 17. Amen. Amen. So, I forgot to mention that I took brother Josh with us when we went into town. We went with our brother to the markets and up and down. Amen. And I bought uh you know the thickened mold so mold drinker. &gt;&gt; I bought some busher. I tried to offer my brother but he was like I think you you are kind of pushing it now. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But I was happy to have it because on the south in I was more than happy to have it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Luke 10 verse 17. &gt;&gt; The Bible reads, "Let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer. Lord Jesus, we are here in your presence and any educated man can read the word. But it takes the action of the spirit to interpret the word and to breathe life into it that it may go and enter the hearts of men. And Lord, you've always used mankind. as men can be, unworthy as men can be, yet you have chosen to use men for the preaching of the gospel. And so we come and stand. Everyone that is in divine presence, let everything be done &gt;&gt; in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Luke 10:1 17 the Bible reads, "I saluted the ministers before brother Gideon walked in. God bless you my brother. And the seven returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you. Not withstanding in this, rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven. In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said, I thank thee, oh father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. Praise the Lord. Amen. All things are delivered to me of my father. And no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him. And he turned unto his disciples and said privately, "Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see. For I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which you see, and have not seen them, and to hear those things which he hear, and have not heard them. Praise the Lord. The grass witherth, the flower fade it, but the word of our God shall stand forever. Praise the Lord. If they would like to give a title to my sermon this morning, I would like to entitle it the bride's revival is perfect realization. The bride's revival is perfect realization. I'm trying to continue with the subject from yesterday because it's all connected. Praise the Lord. It will be a blessing to you all and I am quite aware that there may be different views, different perspectives to the word. And sometimes between ministers there's different areas of emphasis. Now I'm not going to travel all these hours to come into Uganda and cause controversy. Neither am I going to enter into a delusion to think I know better than any one of your ministers. Because I know they are able. But I just want to come and present the word and I pray that the Holy Spirit will water the words to the hearts of the people and my prayers. My presence here and my ministering is a blessing. I say anything contrary to your pastor. Amen. And you have confidence in your pastor. Stay with your pastor's teaching. But if what I'm saying is the word, not another man's opinion, you receive the word and say amen to the word. Amen. And so we were speaking yesterday about the realization of the relationship. I could have continued on from there, but but then the pastor came and continued off from where I left and he's read the quote that I was going to read. Had I continued a minute further, a minute further, I saw the spirit of the Lord moving. Praise the Lord. And I took a peek at brother Tinash's notes. &gt;&gt; You don't know how happy I was to see that I taken his praise the Lord. But he doesn't know he's in for it again today. But oh, it's a pleasure when you have a convention. and you are so far apart and you've not compared notes or discussed but the spirit of the lord drops inspiration in each one of you and the inspiration connects not the work of a man it's the thought of god he wants to give us praise the lord the prophet in the message He says on paragraph 48, &gt;&gt; he says, "I think the church has been preached to death." The thing it needs now is come back to teaching and get them on a foundation so you know how to build yourself up in Christ. And we've built churches upon sensations and upon different things, but we can't build upon nothing but Christ. The revelation of Jesus Christ, that's the only thing that we can do. In him you are complete. &gt;&gt; Without him you are lost. There's not a way in the way in the world for you to be saved. So the prophet is showing there that there's need for the church to be set on a firm foundation and that firm foundation is to bring a teaching upon the church that will stabilize them and help them grow and build themselves up in Christ. Because teaching reveals who you are positionally re it is that revelation that puts you on a solid foundation to then build yourself up in Jesus Christ. Are we together? Exposition of the seven church ages. That was the sign of the inddwelling in the days of Paul. Those who were filled with the Holy Ghost heard the word received it and lived by it. Those who did not have the spirit had it only as cannal man put a wrong interpretation to it went into sin in every age and every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the true believer In every age, the evidence was the same. Those who had the spirit, the teacher, heard the word, and that spirit in them, took the word, and taught it, revealed it to them, and they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and it so you can hear the word. You can parrot the word. You can have the quotes and the verses. You can be in a message church and you can know the doctrine, &gt;&gt; but you may lack the anction to live and express the word. hearing the word as can man and as a can of man. Remember spiritual things are spiritually discerned and discerning is not looking. Discerning is deeper than looking. Discerning is having insight. When we is not connecting that verse, this verse and that verse, BUT IS TO GO TO THE MIND OF THE COMPOSER AND UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANT AND WHAT HE SAID. THEREFORE, you are able to live beyond the dos and don'ts. AND YOU ARE able to express that which is written. That is only possible to the people who have the spirit because they hear the word and the spirit in them teaches them the word that they've heard. as the spirit teaches them, then they are ABLE TO BUILD THEMSELVES UP to the stature of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So there's a growth there even when you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. HE HAS PROMISED US TO SEND US THE spirit of truth TO GUIDE US INTO all the truth. Are we together? &gt;&gt; And what is the truth? &gt;&gt; It is the truth of his word. Hallelujah. IT IS THE WALK OF ENOCH. FOR ENOCH WALKED WITH GOD. ENOCH WAS IN MOTION. ENOCH WAS MOVING. &gt;&gt; There was a moving a progression &gt;&gt; and ENOCH PROGRESSED UNTIL WE REACHED A POINT WHERE HE WAS NO MORE. ARE WE TOGETHER? THE PROPHET SAYS THE BIBLE CONDENSES ITS TRUTH. SO IT'S A SIMPLE LINE, A SIMPLE STATEMENT, but it is a lot of truth that HAS BEEN CONDENSED INTO that line. AND IT TAKES A PROPHETIC CLASS OF people under an ego ANOINTING to decompress. WHAT HAS BEEN COMPRESSED AND CONDENSED BY THE SPIRIT. And they see that when THE BIBLE SAYS ENOCH WALKED WITH GOD, that statement means something. IT WAS EXPERIENCE UPON EXPERIENCE. IT WAS EXPERIENCE UPON EXPERIENCE. It was revelation upon revelation. AND he was growing IN GRACE, IN HIS UNDERSTANDING OF WHO HE WAS. IT WAS A GROWTH IN HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. And so we are promised the same spirit that the overcomers will have that spirit. THEY WILL RECEIVE THE WORD AND the spirit in them will teach that word to them AND THEY WILL GROW &gt;&gt; AND BE ABLE TO LIVE IT AND EXPRESS IT. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And the Lord Jesus Christ according to the portion of scripture that we read have power They are able to cast out demons. They are able to pray for the sick and the sick can recover. They see so many miracles. Humanly speaking, it is something to rejoice about. When you can talk to devils and devils say yes, we are going. and there's sickness there and you pray or you speak the word and sickness goes. &gt;&gt; It is certainly something to rejoice over and their testimony was true because the Lord Jesus Christ did not did not dispute what they were saying because he said to them, I beheld Satan &gt;&gt; as lightning fall from heaven. It was true their testimony. But everything being said and done, he said to them, "But I'd rather you rejoice that because your names are written in heaven." Hallelujah. ALL THESE OTHER MANIFESTATIONS ARE GOOD. rather rejoice to know OR TO CATCH THE REVELATION THAT your names are written in heaven. Oh hallelujah. Amen. And the Bible says in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said, "I thank thee, oh father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent, and he has revealed them unto babes, even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. Hallelujah. And he goes on to say that no one knows the father. No one knows who the son is but the father. &gt;&gt; And who the father is but the son. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; No one knows the son but the father &gt;&gt; and the son. Amen. And then he says, comma, &gt;&gt; amen. And he to whom the son will reveal him. Hallelujah. Amen. In verse 23 then says and he turned him unto his disciples and said privately BLESSED ARE THE EYES WHICH see that you see. SO THERE WAS A PUBLIC MINISTRY and there WAS A P PRIVATE MINISTRY AND NO ONE KNOWS THE FATHER BUT THE SON AND NO ONE KNOWS THE SON BUT THE FATHER. HALLELUJAH. AND NO ONE KNOWS THE SON BUT the one to whom the son reveals to. Are we together? SO YOU WILL NOT KNOW THE FATHER. NEITHER WILL YOU KNOW THE SON UNLESS THE SON REVEALS HIMSELF TO YOU. YOU CAN HEAR ABOUT HIM, &gt;&gt; BUT YOU may not know him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And so he reveals these things to his disciples privately. Mark chapter 4 verse 10 the Bible reads Don't worry I'll wait for you to open your Bibles some of you I don't know when you last read your Bibles so we might as well wait for each other here the book of Mark chapter four and we start from verse 10. No cheating. No cheating. You know sometimes when people are stuck to get to the verse and it gets embarrassing because they keep searching and searching. They don't want to be seen that they are lost. They just open a certain page and pretend like in the right portion, but we're not expecting that. The Bible reads verse 10. And when he was alone, they that were about him with the 12 asked of him the parable. And he said unto them, "Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God. But unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables. that seeing they may see and perceive not, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them. Forgiveness is linked to the revelation. So you if you catch the revelation then you can be righteous because your righteousness is connected to your revelation. cannot receive h righteousness is for them to not receive revelation. If they receive revelation entitled to forgiveness, they are entitled to every blessing. So he spoke unto them in parables because he did not want them to understand and have revelation. But if we read from verse 33 of the same chapter, the Bible reads, "And with many such parables spake he the word unto them as they were able to hear it. but without a parable spake he not unto them. And when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples publicly. He's speaking in parables. are able to hear it but they cannot understand it but privately to his churches then he expounds all things Luke chapter 24 how many love to read their Bibles I trust that you are happy to read your Bible Luke chapter 24 starting from verse 27. The Lord Jesus Christ has been crucified. He has died a violent death under capital punishment of the Roman authority that was governing over Judea at that time. And the disciples are disappointed. They are despondent, discouraged, confused because they could not understand the season that they were in. And as they are talking about these things, and his friend on the way to Amos As they are talking about these things, the Lord joins with them after his resurrection. And the Bible starts now in verse 27 and says, "And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, HE EXPOUNDED UNTO them in all the scriptures that things concerning himself." That's teaching. Now he is establishing them. on the reality of the gospel to bring a revelation upon them that what has happened is not a loss. It is a fulfillment of scripture all THE WAY FROM THE BOOKS OF Moses to the prophets. He is expounding to them the scriptures so that they understand the season that they are in but they see it they did not see it. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO TEACHING CAN TAKE PLACE teaching for that matter right teaching the correct people can sit under a teaching ministry the WORD CORRECTLY EXPOUNDED TO them and still still not have revelation BECAUSE THEY WALKED A WHOLE JOURNEY AND HE WAS EXPOUNDING TO THEM from Moses the prophet the scriptures but they didn't see it and they drew nigh unto the village wheither they went and he made as though he would have gone further and they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward towards evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tell with them and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them. He took bread and blessed it to break and gave to them and their EYES WERE OPEN. AND THEY KNEW him and he vanished OUT OF THEIR SIGHT. IT TOOK A SUPERNATURAL ELEMENT, NOT JUST TEACHING BUT A SUPERNATURAL ELEMENT that they could identify. No one else can BREAK BREAD THE WAY THAT BREAD HAS BEEN BROKEN. THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE THERE IS ONLY ONE THAT CAN BREAK BREAD THE WAY IT'S BEEN BROKEN. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THEY HAD SEEN HIM BREAK BREAD BEFORE. THEY HAD WITNESSED THE BREAKING OF BREAD AND IT WAS MIRACULOUS. ONLY HIM COULD BREAK BREAD LIKE THAT. AND WHEN THEY LOOKED AND SAW HIM BREAK BREAD AGAIN THE SAME WAY THAT HE HAD DONE BEFORE. THEY SAID NO MAN CAN DO THIS. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. IT CAN ONLY BE HIM. WE HAVE SEEN HIM BEFORE AND IT IS ONLY HIM. BREAK IT LIKE THAT. THEN THEIR EYES WERE OPEN AND THEY KNEW HIM. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WE COULD TEACH THIS AFTERNOON. IF HE DOESN'T COME AND BREAK IT TO YOU THE WAY HE ONLY CAN BREAK IT, &gt;&gt; YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE HIM. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE IS THE ONLY ONE &gt;&gt; THAT CAN BREAK IT &gt;&gt; WITH CREATIVE POWER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THEY SAW IT AND KNEW HIM, that discouragement went away. The the the confusion WENT AWAY. EVERY NEGATIVE THING WENT AWAY AND THEY WERE QUICKENED IN THEIR SPIRIT, QUICKENED IN THEIR BODIES. AND WE SAID, "HOW CAN WE SIT WHEN WE HAVE WITNESSED WHAT WE HAVE WITNESSED? LET US GO BACK AND TELL THE BRETHREN &gt;&gt; THAT HE IS RISEN." &gt;&gt; WHEN HE BREAKS THE BREAD, TO YOU AND YOU SEE HIM AND KNOW HIM. YOU CANNOT SIT DOWN. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO BE A WITNESS THAT HE IS NOT DEAD IS ALIVE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TELL THE BRETHREN THAT HE IS RESURRECTED. &gt;&gt; HE IS ALIVE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. If I'll bother you to sit a while. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And when they went to his brethren, they went back to THE BRETHREN TO TELL THEM, "DON'T BE DISCOURAGED, BROTHER. DON'T BE CONFUSED. HE IS ALIVE. WE KNOW. WE ARE NOT GUESSING. WE ARE NOT RECITING SCRIPTURES. WE KNOW THAT HE IS ALIVE. WE KNOW THAT HE IS REAL. WE ARE NOT RECITING QUOTATIONS. WE KNOW THAT HE IS HERE. PRAISE THE LORD. AMEN. BUT THE BRETHREN BEING IN THE FLESH COULD NOT BELIEVE HIM. THEY WERE IN A LOCKED ROOM of their lives confused and everything but the Lord came. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 41 of Luke chapter 24. It says there, "And while they yet believed not for joy and wondered, he said unto them, have ye here any meat? Let's not rush. The pastor said, "We've got a bit of time." So, let's read verse 32 and continue. &gt;&gt; And they said one to another, "Did not our hearts burn within us whilst he talked to us by the way?" He opened the scriptures to us and they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the 11 gathered together and them that were with them. And they told what things were done in the way and HOW HE WAS KNOWN of them in the breaking of bread. And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said unto them, "Peace be unto you. When a true witness is giving the witness of THE GOSPEL, God comes on THE SCENE TO BEAR WITNESS THAT THEY ARE TELLING THE TRUTH. AS THEY WERE WITNESSING THE RESURRECTED CHRIST WHOM THEY HAD SEEN AND KNOWN, HE CAME RIGHT THERE TO WITNESS THE SAME. HE IS STILL THE SAME YESTERDAY TODAY AND FOREVER. AND WHEN TRUE WITNESSES ARE WITNESSING THAT HE IS ALIVE, HE COMES ON THE SCENE AND BEARS WITNESS THAT HE is real and he is alive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen Lord. &gt;&gt; But they were terrified and afrighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit. It tells you how culture is very strong. Have you seen how many times in the scripture they thought they had seen a spirit when they were praying for Peter to be released and God answered their prayer. And when they looked AT THEIR PRAYER, THEY THOUGHT they had seen a spirit. It tells you that THERE WAS A LOT OF TALKS ABOUT SPIRITS AND GHOSTS. is the scripture and the fulfillment of scripture culture and traditions and you can do THE SAME. GOD ANSWERS your prayer and you see a tool there and you see you know some AFRICA BLACK MAGIC BECAUSE YOUR PERCEPTION IS molded by what has been placed in you. BUT THE WORD comes to do away with all the wrong teaching, ALL THE CULTURE AND TRADITIONS AND establishes you in the word. Anyway, to cut the long story short, he shows them that he's not a spirit, eats flesh with them. And he starts to show them in verse 44. And he said unto them, "These are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms concerning me." THEN OPENED HE THEIR understanding that they might understand the scriptures. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS OTHER SIDE OF HIS death whilst he was in HIS FLESH BEFORE the crucifixion. He took his time to privately teach and expound the scriptures TO HIS DISCIPLES. AND WE ARE LEARNING NOW THAT EVEN AFTER HIS RESURRECTION, HE DOES NOT CHANGE HIS PATTERN BUT PRIVATELY HE STARTS TO VISIT HIS DISCIPLES ONE BY ONE. CLUS AND HIS FRIEND AND EXPOUND THE SCRIPTURES TO THEM BEGINNING AT MOSES, THE PROPHETS, the psalms and expound THE SCRIPTURES. AND AS THEY GO TO WITNESS TO THE OTHER DISCIPLES, HE FOLLOWS THEM AND DOES THE SAME THING THAT HE WAS DOING BEFORE HIS CRUCIFIXION PRIVATELY TO HIS DISCIPLES TO EXPLAIN THE SCRIPTURES, TEACH THE SCRIPTURES AND OPEN THEIR EYES SO THAT THEY MAY. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THE BIBLE SAYS HE OPENED THEIR UNDERSTANDING. THAT'S NOT A NATURAL THING BECAUSE IN THE NATURAL THEY HAD FAILED TO SEE. BUT IT WAS A SPIRITUAL THING THAT HE HAD TO DO TO OPEN THEIR MINDS, UNDERSTAND THE SEASON THAT THEY WERE IN. AMEN. AND HE DOES NOT CHANGE. &gt;&gt; HE DID IT THEN. &gt;&gt; HE IS GOING TO DO THE SAME NOW. &gt;&gt; THAT AFTER TEACHING, HE HAS GOT TO COME TO YOU AND OPEN UP YOUR UNDERSTANDING TO UNDERSTAND THE SCRIPTURES AND THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. YOU CAN BE TAUGHT THE MESSAGE BUT WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST ACTION YOU CANNOT KNOW HIM FOR SPIRITUAL THINGS ARE SPIRITUALLY DISCERN AND YOU NEED THE SPIRIT &gt;&gt; TO OPEN THE word amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU NEED THE SPIRIT TO SHOW YOU &gt;&gt; WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; MOSES &gt;&gt; WAS TOLD BY HIS MOTHER, &gt;&gt; "YOU ARE A DELIVERER. &gt;&gt; YOU WERE BORN FOR A PURPOSE. YOU CAME INTO THIS WORLD, FOR A PURPOSE." AND HE WAS TOLD TIME AND TIME again until he believed it. &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS ONLY A PARTIAL REALIZATION. AND HE WENT IN THE POWER OF A PARTIAL REALIZATION TO CARRY OUT A COMMISSION. AND THE PROPHET SAYS, &gt;&gt; THE ONLY THING HE ACHIEVED WAS ONE DEAD STINKING EGYPTIAN. THE RESULTS OF OPERATING UNDER A PARTIAL REALIZATION EMBARRASSMENT ARE AN EMBARRASSMENT. THEY ARE A FAILURE. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT, HE WAS BANISHED INTO THE WILDERNESS. BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING SUPERNATURAL THAT GOD HAD TO DO TO MOSES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND GOD HAD TO APPROACH MOSES &gt;&gt; IN THE WAY THAT WORKED FOR MOSES. &gt;&gt; GOD WILL HAVE TO APPROACH YOU IN THE WAY YOU ARE IN YOUR MAKEUP. &gt;&gt; MOSES, &gt;&gt; I'm sorry I'm rushing now. &gt;&gt; It's okay, &gt;&gt; but I'll slow down a bit. &gt;&gt; And Moses &gt;&gt; was a scientific mind. He had been well taught &gt;&gt; in the greatest civilization of that TIME which was Egypt. The ones that were building the pyramids, THE ONES THAT were imbaling BODIES that still look like they could blink even now. They were an advanced scientific CIVILIZATION and Moses had received THE BEST of that SCIENTIFIC AND he was A SCIENTIFIC MIND AND HE UNDERSTOOD COMBUSTION THAT IF THERE'S FUEL oxygen oxygen AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THERE'S and and HEAT AND COMBUSTION IS TAKING PLACE THEN THAT THING SHOULD BURN OUT. AND WHEN HE LOOKED AND HIS SCIENTIFIC MIND COULD NOT COMPREHEND WHAT WAS HAPPENING, HE WAS ATTRACTED TO THE PHENOMENA OF THE burning bush. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. ANOTHER PERSON MIGHT HAVE WALKED AWAY AND HE TURNED ASIDE ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AND THAT WAS GOD SAYING MOSES COMING AND TALKED TO HIM. AND HE EXPERIENCED SOMETHING THAT WAS REAL. FROM THAT EXPERIENCE, MOSES BECAME A DIFFERENT MAN. AMEN. AMEN. NOW, how did he become a different man? The prophet says, Moses was born with the equipment in HIM to deliver Israel. HE DID NOT BECOME a different man because new things were added to him. HE BECAME A DIFFERENT MAN BECAUSE WHAT WAS ALREADY IN HIM WAS QUICKENED &gt;&gt; BY THE PRESENCE of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; MOSES &gt;&gt; WAS MADE CONSCIOUS &gt;&gt; OF WHO HE WAS. &gt;&gt; HE WAS MADE CONSCIOUS &gt;&gt; IN A SUPERNATURAL WAY. THE SAME MESSAGE THAT HIS MOTHER HAD TOLD HIM WAS NOW QUICKENED TO HIM BY THE SPIRIT. LET ME SAY TO YOU BROTHERS and sister the same message that the mother church has been teaching you telling you THAT YOU ARE BRIDE THAT YOU ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. BEEN A TRUE MESSAGE, BUT YOU MAY NOT BE ACTING LIKE A SON OR ACTING LIKE A DAUGHTER. THAT MESSAGE &gt;&gt; HAS NOT YET BEEN QUICKENED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND WE PRAY THIS AFTERNOON THAT YOU MAY RECEIVE A QUICKENING. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OF THE MESSAGE THAT HAS BEEN PLANTED IN YOU. YOU ARE A SON OF GOD. YOU CAME FROM GOD. YOU GO BACK TO GOD. AMEN. OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN, LORD. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE MESSAGE TO BRING YOU TO AN AWAKENING TO LET YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT AN ACCIDENT. YOU CAME ON THIS EARTH FOR A PURPOSE. YOU WERE PREDESTINATED TO COME ON THIS EARTH TO BE A SON OF GOD, TO BE A DAUGHTER OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS. &gt;&gt; YOU MAY BE SEATED a bit. &gt;&gt; Amen Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message harvest time. Hallelujah. No man can come to me, said Jesus, except my father draws him. And all that the father hath past tense, that the father hath given me. Hath is already PAST TENSE. It's already been DONE that the father had given ME COME TO ME to the word. How can they come &gt;&gt; unless they were all they were for ordained to COME as many as received him. To them gave he the power to become sons of God. See, because their names were on the book, HE COME TO redeem what was on THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; IN REVELATION, WE FIND out when the seals was opened, &gt;&gt; there was a book and HIM THAT SAT UPON THE THRONE, HE HAD IT IN his right hand and there wasn't nothing nobody in heaven or in earth or anywhere was worthy to take the book or to even look on it. John wept with great because the whole book of redemption was there. &gt;&gt; SO THAT BOOK THAT WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE ONE WHO SAT ON THE THRONE, &gt;&gt; THE BOOK WHICH NO MAN WAS WORTHY WAS WORTHY ON take that book. THE LAMB MOVED IN AND TOOK THAT BOOK. AND THE PROPHET IS SAYING BECAUSE IT was the whole book of REDEMPTION RIGHT THERE. Are we together? Amen. And then in the third seal, the prophet says, EVERYBODY IN HEAVEN, EVERYTHING BENEATH THE EARTH AND EVERYTHING HEARD HIM PRAISING GOD ABOUT IT, JOHN MUST HAVE FOUND HIS NAME ON. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. JOHN MUST HAVE FOUND HIS NAME ON THERE. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. SO IT IS THE BOOK the complete book of redemption the whole BOOK OF REDEMPTION BUT IT IS ALSO A BOOK OF NAMES BECAUSE WHEN JOHN LOOKED IN HE SAW HIS NAME AND REJOICED GREATLY. &gt;&gt; OH HALLELUJAH. AMEN. SO IT IS A BOOK OF NAMES. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; My oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Question and answers on the seals. The prophet is asked a question. Is it true that every Jew born since Christ that came into the world is to be saved? No, nothing will be saved. Only those whose names were put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world, Jew or Gentile. See, that's all &gt;&gt; the book holds that mystery. AND THE BOOK &gt;&gt; IS only unfolding it now. Not each one's name. I said it is a book of names. It is the whole book of someone is expecting to see their name in THERE as in THE WAY YOUR MOTHER and your father named you. It is propaganda that made you believe that your NAME IS MICHAEL BECAUSE THEY WERE CALLING YOU MICHAEL OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL YOU BELIEVED IT, THAT YOUR NAME IS MICHAEL AND YOUR SURNAME ISMA BECAUSE that's what they TOLD YOU. THAT'S WHAT THEY PUT ON YOUR PAPER AND YOU CAN LEAVE IT. BUT GOD DOES NOT WRITE YOUR NAME LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE YOUR NAME IS CONNECTED TO YOUR BIRTH. I AM A &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I WAS BORN IN THAT FAMILY AND I INHERITED THE NAME AND GOD THE FATHER HAS GOT A NAME FOR YOU AND THAT NAME IS CONNECTED TO YOUR SPIRITUAL GENES. YOUR NAME ON YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS CONNECTED TO YOUR NATURAL GENES. BUT YOUR NAME IN HEAVEN IS CONNECTED TO YOUR SPIRITUAL TEAM. AND AND WHEN GOD WRITES IT IN A BOOK, HE WRITES IT IN A SPIRITUAL WAY SO THAT THE SPIRITUAL SEED IN YOU IS ABLE TO READ AND SEE THE NAME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AND HOW DOES HE WRITE IT? &gt;&gt; He doesn't write no. Not in each one's name, but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names. YOU FINALLY UNDERSTAND THAT NOW. See the book doesn't say now LE IS TO BE SAVED IN TIME of this church age or whoever. NO, IT DON'T SAY THAT. IT JUST SHOWS THE MYSTERY UNFOLDS THE MYSTERY OF WHAT THE THING IS. BUT WE OURSELVES BY FAITH BELIEVE IT. AND WHAT IS FAITH? REVELATION. WE BY REVELATION ARE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE BOOK AND SEE OUR NAMES BECAUSE IT IS A MYSTERY OF OUR LIVES. IT IS A MYSTERY OF OUR FAMILY. AND MY NAME &gt;&gt; IS RIGHT THERE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let me skip some things here. All right, I'm watching the time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The anointed ones at the end time. &gt;&gt; Okay, I I can't skip this. I think it's too good. Just skip it. The spoken word is the original seed. That's what's the matter today. &gt;&gt; You want some kind of a phony makeup, screaming, jumping, speaking in tongues or something instead of waiting for the real word of God to be made manifest THROUGH THE BRIDE. AND WHO'S THE BRIDE? Them kind that takes the word is God's true bride bringing forth children. They can't die. A CHILD THE BRIDE BRINGS FORTH ON THE WORD CAN'T DIE BECAUSE IT'S THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; DID YOU GET IT? SHE CAN DIE BECAUSE THAT CHILD CAN DIE because he's a word child. He's a seed. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THE SEED HOLDS TRUE. THEY WILL GO RUNNING FOR THE PASTOR. THEY WILL GO RUNNING TO THE DEACON TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY ARE HEAVENLY BEINGS, CANDIDATES OF ASSOCIATION, &gt;&gt; TWO ANGELIC BEINGS, the anointed ones of the end time. Notice the very day when this messenger, &gt;&gt; not when he starts on, but when he begins to declare &gt;&gt; THIRDP MINISTRY IS THE MINISTRY OF THE OPENING OF the word and THERE IS A CLASS OF PEOPLE ARE CALLED BY THE THIRD POOL. BECAUSE IN THE MYSTERY OF THE THIRD POOL IS THE MYSTERY OF THEIR NAMES IS THE MYSTERY OF THEIR LIVES. They are rainbow trout. YOU CAN'T FISH THEM THE SAME WAY YOU FISH OTHER FISH. But you've GOT TO GIVE IT A HARDER PULL. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO ATTRACT THE RAINBOW TROUT RAINBOW COVENANT TO GOD'S PEOPLE. THEY ARE A COVENANT PEOPLE AND THEY BELIEVE A COVENANT MESSAGE. AMEN. OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And the brother says, &gt;&gt; "There's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets." But the only way the prophet can be vindicated is by the word and to reveal TO REVEAL THE HIDDEN truth that's been sealed in the word. I want to repeat this. The third pool was the opening of them. The third pool was the opening of them seven SEALS in the word was the attraction on the mountain. I've got my mind set on THIS MESSAGE. THAT'S that dead pool is the one I must be loyal and reverent to. Amen. And I won't turn back. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. I'VE GOT MY MIND ON THIS MESSAGE. IT'S THAT THIRD POOL. It is the RISING OF THE SUN. HE SAYS he is the one who opened those seals. &gt;&gt; He is those seals FOR THE WHOLE WORD OF GOD IS CHRIST AND CHRIST &gt;&gt; IS THE SEALS. THAT WAS OPENED. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE OPENING OF THE SEALS THEN? &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE OPENING OF THE SEALS THERE? &gt;&gt; THE REVEALING OF CHRIST. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST. HE IS STILL DOING THE SAME THING, VISITING HIS CHILDREN PRIVATELY, EXPOUNDING THE SCRIPTURES, EXPOUNDING THE SCRIPTURES, STARTING FROM PAUL, FROM MARTIN, FROM COLUMBA, &gt;&gt; FROM LUTHER RIGHT TO THIS DAY. HE IS EXPOUNDING TO HIS PEOPLE WHO HE IS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Amen Lord. Oh, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Future home. Why is it important &gt;&gt; for him TO REVEAL HIMSELF? BECAUSE IN THE REVEALING OF HIMSELF IS THE REVEALING of his bride. And in the message future home, paragraph 267. And if you are the bride, the bride is a part of the husband. The only PLACE THAT YOU WILL EVER RECOGNIZE IT IS TO RECOGNIZE WHAT PART OF THAT HUSBAND, WHAT PART OF THAT WORLD you are, you can't recognize BEING THE BRIDE. HOW MANY SEES THAT? YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE YOUR POSITION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE MINISTRY OF ELIZA &gt;&gt; WAS A MINISTRY TO EXPLAIN JESUS CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. AND HE EXPLAINED HIM SO WELL. HE WAS SAYING NOT ABOUT HIMSELF BUT HE WAS SPEAKING OF HIS MASTER'S SON. Oh my master son. Amen. Oh, he is so handsome. He is so good-looking. He is so wellmannered. He is so hardwork.

THERE WAS NOTHING THAT HE LACKED. TO PROVE THAT HE CAME FROM GOD WITH THE MESSAGE OF GOD. AMEN. Amen Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND AS ELEA &gt;&gt; WAS EXPLAINING &gt;&gt; AND EXPLAINING &gt;&gt; AND REBECCA REBECCA &gt;&gt; STARTED TO SEE THE VISION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; STARTED TO SEE THE VISION.

You are here to live a victorious life. YOU A MANIFESTED SON, MANIFESTED DAUGHTER. You cannot fall. You are going to the rapture. &gt;&gt; Not because of what you did. or what you never did, but because of his fornowledge and he CHOSE YOU IN HIM BEFORE the foundation of the world and you are coming to that perfect realization. Your condition doesn't control you. YOUR SITUATION DOESN'T CONTROL YOU. YOU CAME FROM GOD, YOU GO BACK TO GOD. YOU ARE A THOUGHT OF GOD EXPRESSED. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You are the bride of his world. Thank you, Lord Jesus. You never fail. You are worthy. You are worthy, Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, every time after camp, after services like this, I hear a great testimony. So I'm not wondering but I know lives are being turned around situations are being changed in your life. You are coming to that place of perfect realization. Yes Lord. Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; Fathers, mothers bear with us. This is why we are here at come. The word will be preached. But there is that supernatural element that cannot be done by man. But only God can &gt;&gt; and he is here. So let's not rush it. Let's give it a moment. Oh yes. It's not It's more than emotions, friends. It's more than emotion. Goes way beyond that. We've seen lives change. YOURS can change. Maybe the devil lied to you and told you you are a sinner. YOU ARE GOOD FOR NOTHING. You are not the bride. But we have had DIFFERENT TODAY. THOSE ARE LIES. LIES. You are here because you are a child of God. Something drew on you to come. Something drew you to come here. And you are here. And he is here. Something is bound to happen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah Lord Jesus. Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. We bless your name, Lord. You're reviving us again. You're reviving us again. Thank you for your presence. Thank you for your word, Lord. Thank you for the opportunity of coming to this place, &gt;&gt; the place of our anointing. Someone is receiving a fresh anointing, fresh revelation, revival in OUR SOUL. REVIVAL IS not to revive those who are new and coming out coming from the world. But those WHO ARE THERE, WE ARE HERE, LORD. You're reviving us again. For this is the bright revival, the perfect realization of who we are. Yes, Lord. into my heart. Come into my heart. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; come in. Come in to stay. Hallelujah. Come into my heart. Now listen. every eye closed. &gt;&gt; There are people here &gt;&gt; that the devil had lied to and told you you were not the bride. That's a lie. Now listen and you've been beating yourself thinking all is lost and you're lost. Now, we're going to do something different. You may be two or three. I don't know. I'm inviting you to come. This is your moment. This is why you came to come. Just a mere fact of walking from your seat and walking to the altar. You don't have to kneel. Just come and stand. When the boy came, &gt;&gt; he came to himself to A REALIZATION. &gt;&gt; HE did not STAY WHERE HE WAS. He walked to HIS FATHER. &gt;&gt; AND he said, "FATHER, here I am. RECEIVE ME AT LEAST AS A SERVANT." &gt;&gt; BUT THAT WAS PARTIAL REALIZATION. HE NEEDED TO COME TO PERFECT REALIZATION. Now I want you to walk here. COME INTO A FULL REALIZATION THAT your sins that have been in your life don't count anymore. You have come to a realization that I'm a son, a child of my father. No matter what comes and goes who I am does not change. Hallelujah. That cow was not fattened that day. He has always been a son. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Friends, this is why we came to come. You do not know how my heart feels to see people come into a realization that they are the generation of the righteous no matter what a devil had done in their lives, battered them, broken some bones, gone through thick and thick, to all is gone. But there CAN BE A REVIVAL AGAIN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Maybe there is some more. Maybe there's some more. &gt;&gt; Don't listen to the lies of the devil. Listen, one of the camps we had, a young lady just made a trip to come at the altar. She was just on the verge of completely going to the world, but God restored HER RIGHT NOW. AND SHE'S STILL STANDING today serving God because it's not just an emotion. IT'S A LIVING REALITY. THE GOD OF this message is a real God. This is what the third pool is. The realization, perfect realization of who you are that comes by the WORD moved on you by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Come into my heart. Lord Jesus Jesus come today to stay. Come into my heart. Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; To you at the altar. &gt;&gt; When they came, the father never told that that boy that he will take the place of a servant because you've done so much that is bad. Listen, &gt;&gt; the actions that were in his life in the past when the perfect realization of who he was came did not matter anymore. There's a shift happening in his life and he was never the same again. So I'd be right if I tell you right now, you young people at the altar, I'd be right if I prophesied over your life and I tell you, you will never be the same. It doesn't matter what the DEVIL'S TOLD YOU. It doesn't matter how much you've been beaten down. IT doesn't matter WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. YOU HAVE COME to a PERFECT REALIZATION. YOU ARE A SON OF GOD. SOMETHING IN YOU DREW YOU HERE. I DIDN'T CALL YOU BY NAME. THE NAME THAT YOUR FATHER CALLED YOU. THE NAME THAT YOUR MOTHER CALLED YOU. BUT WHEN THE WORD WAS GONE, YOU HEARD YOUR NAME BEING CALLED. AND THEN THE HOLY GHOST MOVED ON MY HEART TO INVITE YOU HERE. INVITE YOU. THIS WAS FOR YOU. YOUR NAME HAS BEEN CALLED. YOU CAN NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN. HALLELUJAH. Lord Jesus, I'm asking you, Lord, to come and take over in the lives of these young people, Lord. May they walk away from this camp and may they all of a sudden realize there has been a shift in their life. The things that were defeating them, they will walk over it. You will move mountains on their behalf. You will move mountains for them. Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Cause walls to fall. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, what a praises in the presence. Brother Shalom, help me. of Jehovah. God, Lord Almighty, &gt;&gt; Prince of Peace. Let the prince of peace come into your heart. Troubles vanished. Hallelujah. In the praise of the king. We sing it one more time as you go. Check your seats. In the presence, everybody now. In the presence, &gt;&gt; Lord Almighty. &gt;&gt; Lord Almighty.

Let everyone give the Lord a great clap. Amen. Amen. Let us put our hands together to appreciate God for our God bless you, Pastor Michael. You know when he says takes a supernatural element, the pastor, the preachers, they can teach and teach. that got to me because I experienced that. But I've decided to quit my church because I found father truth. But I had had IT FOR SIX MONTHS UNTIL that supernatural element. Nothing happened before. I relate to that. some years ago, a man in Ethiopia, we walked into Ethiopia, just myself and my wife and u because we had gone for our honeymoon and so you know we um preach the word a few places and one person believes the message. Her name is Yodit. And when sister Yodi received the message, her life it was like it was QUICKENED came to life. SHE CAME TO A REALIZATION OF WHO SHE IS AND SHE GOT ON FIRE STARTED INVITING PEOPLE. EVERYBODY SHE KNEW, SHE WANTED THEM TO RECEIVE THIS MESSAGE. IF YOU'RE CONVINCED THAT THIS MESSAGE IS THE TRUTH, YOU'RE GOING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT IT. And so what she did, she quickly ran and called a few friends. And then she came and told me, "There is this friend of mine. He's in the Bible college, very good preacher, but I I I believe he received the message." So he he brought him and you know so we we sat down and talked the first day talked the second day talked the third day there seemed to be nothing there but one day this man comes to a perfect realization I think other brothers had even met him already nothing happened I met him nothing happened but one day in my office at the church he says I've seen it. And he now started fidgeting. He said, "I don't know now. Advise me because I have seen it and I want to be baptized right now. But my wife, I have not seen it yet. So what should I do? Should I hide it from HER FOR NOW?" HE WAS ON FIRE. AND I TOLD HIM, "BROTHER, do whatever is in your heart." HE SAID, "BAPTIZE ME NOW, AND I WILL SORT MY wife later. THAT MAN IS RIGHT HERE." HALLELUJAH. WHAT IS IT? &gt;&gt; A PERFECT REALIZATION. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Brother Michael, you put me on fire. We have to go for lunch, but I feel like I can preach a sermon. Amen. And he's one of them. Those men are turning Ethiopia up with this message of the hour. I tell you, our friends, this message is not some church. We thank God for men that have carried it over the years. In our country, we have men like Pastor Gideon. This man has preached &gt;&gt; on radio, &gt;&gt; on TV. &gt;&gt; He's traveled, western Uganda, many places for about how many years? 30 something years. &gt;&gt; 27 years. 27 years. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And pastor, we appreciate you for your support standing with us. It's a big big encouragement. Amen. Yes. I think there are even some young people from speckled band. If you're from raise up your hand, God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We appreciate you all. Appreciate God for Pastor Gideon and his ministry. Amen. When I met brother Isaac for my first time, I was amazed. &gt;&gt; It was in Gasher. And this man I had seen brother Don Rian preach and um so when I saw him preach I was like this is the African version. I EVEN THINK brother Isaac has not given us his best. You still have a debt to pay. Don't you think I don't know that? And we appreciate you, brother Isaac and all our brethren from Kenya. Now we can go back and tell our people and our family we have come to a perfect realization who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know when I met Pastor Michael in Path and maybe you may not know but he has one of the largest assemblies in Australia if not the largest. And this is um um I I saw his vision and his focus and his burden and I told him I I see a lot of myself in him and I I I felt connected and I quickly knew that we would work together and so I'm so honored that you accepted our invitation. Amen. This is uh just the beginning. &gt;&gt; I wish you were going to preach a few more times. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many appreciate they were? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, God bless you. &gt;&gt; I think we just have to dismiss now. &gt;&gt; And um and go back to now have lunch. &gt;&gt; So, we have about an hour. Um, so we'll be back here at 1:45. &gt;&gt; The service is beginning at 1:45 and Brother Joshua Walker will be speaking to us about so for him. Pray for him. Let us pray for all the speakers that God will use them. And you know, Pastor Pastor Michael said something today. He said, um, if something is said by any of the preachers and you know it sounds like an opinion, it's it's not based on the word. You young people, stay with your pastor's teaching. I have never been accused and it's not my intention to gather young people and bundle them into a certain doctrine. These meetings are not doctrine based. It's not camp based. We are not part of any camp. It's all about the message of God. Amen. And so, uh, but if the man of
