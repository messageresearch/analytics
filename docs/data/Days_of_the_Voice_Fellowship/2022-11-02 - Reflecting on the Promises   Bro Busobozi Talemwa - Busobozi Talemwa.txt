the Hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your cost there shall not any man be able to stand before thee or the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee amen Yeshua is foreign [Music] I'd like to thank God for each of you that have made it today when is the service tonight brother Fred this evening and

and so I pray that as you are here this evening the Lord will speak to you because he knows the desires of your hands I would like us to reflect on the Promises this evening our promises as the children of God and his promises to us Navy soon him as our God yeah I'd like us to look at Joshua here when God is speaking to uh uh when God is speaking to Joshua the same same way he spoke to Moses he said as I was with Moses does God mean those words [Music] now don't look at them as if you were speaking it to Joshua he is speaking to you are you okay because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he says I will not fail thee nor forsake me praise the name of the Lord in Genesis chapter 1 verse 27 example God Gathering says he has ever given in a form of a promise to the children or the sons of men on verse 27 he says so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created heathens [Music] and God bless them God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth when the moment God created Man In His Image the very first thing God did he blessed man so let no man ever tell you that God doesn't want to bless you because the purpose and the desire of God is for man to be blessed remember man in his own image if you're walking in the image of God walking in the spirit of God then you are blessed and he says and God said unto them be fruitful now if your feet if you are blessed God wants you to be fruitful and God doesn't want you to remain the same yeah he wants you to multiply and replace and have dominion over the fish God doesn't want you to have only one shot for five years God doesn't want you to have one dress for the whole time God doesn't want us to have a 50 people in the church for five years if you're married God doesn't want you to be without children you see God wants you to multiply it could be same whatever God made in this world he makes it to multiply when he created a black flower he met he made it multiplied yeah and he did red flowers and roses and he makes it in a way that it will be able to multiply yeah comes in the devil always destroyed yes and we have seen the genetically modified foods when you saw them those seeds cannot re uh reply or cannot multiply themselves you cannot plant those seeds again and they will bring forth of their kind again because they are dead to begin with but you see whatever has life it must multiply whatever was created by God it must multiply do you understand what I'm saying if you have a means that means seed must multiply oh foreign [Applause] foreign find out what has gone wrong in your life because the intention and purpose of God for your life is for you to multiply but we could be same is for you to be fruitful one day when Jesus was walking he found a mango tree and this mango tree looks so beautiful but the mango tree did not have one mango on that fruit on that tree and Jesus was not happy with this yes what did he do with it he said because I can't have any fruit from you you will never have any fruit in the days foreign and God has promises and this it is him who spoke it fast before anybody foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] God wants you to ask big things he doesn't want you to be like a petty uh like Petty and juvenile he wants you to ask big things that your choice may be full name God wants to ask for big things not small things how many have big plans what are your big plans this coming year or before this year closes or before the coming of the Lord where do you want to be what will you go to be that where you will be physically and spiritually will be determined by what you want again that God has already given it all to you God has already told you I've given you my blessings and you know the word of God he doesn't need to speak many words he says replenishances now if you go out into the world and they are not able to have dominion and you're not able to multiply you're not able to be fruitful I'm not able to subdue it is not God in the wrong it is you who has not yet found what you want to understand God doesn't want us to be afraid to ask for big things some believers they need to begin asking for big things begin

the water up never worry that wouldn't be too hard how many times could we multiply you could never exhaust God in his powers to his children we can never existence please please go and tell that young man it's almost finishing up my bless the blessing of God is unequenchable today I'm speaking on the Promises reflecting on the Promises reflecting on the blessings of God maybe God knows someone here needs it is let us reason together so God is listening with you today in the form of his word it is up to you if you will hear it and receive it is that praise the name of the Lord you could never exist God in his powers and his message to his children he is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life and it says amen you can never exhaust the promises and the blessing of God Hallelujah I want you to see the Promise here that he gave to Abraham in Genesis 12 verse now the Lord said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy father's house and to a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and are blessed thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and cast them that cast thee and and thee in indeed shall all the families of the earth be blessed is as I was reading this I was just marveling whenever this is that when God was blessing Abra cartoon he did not withhold anything [Music] progress God blessed Abraham with an abundant blessing he did not withhold he gave him a seven Sevenfold blessings seven some is got this number of Perfections are there are different numbers in the scriptures is is is is number of perfection seven is a number of completions and so we see that seven here was a number of complete completions not Perfection and and was indicating that Abram have given you my full complete blessing I've left nothing Hallelujah man I've given it all to you just like you remember in the same same way when when they uh when Jacob was blessed by his father the father of of of Isaac was Abram each one experience and you know this blessing was going on down the generation and when Jacob received that the simplest thing from from his father isaacsa came running after because there's some little left for me do you remember what he told him I said I'm sorry I've given it all away I don't have even a little less listen to me when God gives you a blessing this Blessing of Abraham um look foreign foreign [Applause] [Applause] you know there's a song that says [Music] this sauce never runs dry it can never run drunk and this sauce is not a religious entity is not a society is not a company it's not a job that you have this source is the blessing of God within this blessing it's not even family inheritance it's not even family inheritance I don't know how many here have some family inheritance some of us never inherited anything from our family not even one inch of a piece of balance but we are blessed by God it's not the blessing of a family family it's not the blessing of the things that you will receive in the world the Bible says you can gain the whole world it's not the things that we gain in the world it is the things that we gain from the supernatural Abraham lost it all right but God gave him a seven-fold blessings I will make the a great nation now foreign each of this blessing is different you know your name is [Applause] foreign Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself I have have I sworn saith the Lord for because thou Hast done this thing and ask not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has to obeyed my voice is [Music] foreign you know and I often hear from many people about is really hard we are going through hard

crime action good for you and finish so I wanted to listen very careful these promises and I will be finishing the next 30 minutes so these promises are not for everyone these promises are only for
