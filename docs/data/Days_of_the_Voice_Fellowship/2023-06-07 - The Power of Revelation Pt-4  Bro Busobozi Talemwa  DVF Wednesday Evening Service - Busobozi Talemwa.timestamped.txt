[29:24] speak to their congregation as well yes
[29:33] so while we are preaching to you here at

[29:42] so may the Lord bless us in the in the
[29:45] world tonight
[29:47] amen please go to our Bibles while we
[29:50] stand trillion Bible is a thing
[29:53] in the book of Hebrews
[29:57] yeah
[29:59] Hebrews chapter 11
[30:11] so even the ones that strip me in this
[30:13] service
[30:17] the ones that also will watch it after
[30:21] sometimes we forget to mention about you
[30:26] but we certainly agree to all of you the
[30:28] name of Jesus Christ
[30:32] Hebrews 11 verses
[30:39] but without faith it is impossible to
[30:42] please him for he that cometh to God
[30:44] must believe that he is and that he is a
[30:47] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[30:48] him
[30:51] is
[30:51] [Music]
[31:09] so I'm speaking on the power of
[31:11] Revelation this will be uh part
[31:17] 4.4 it's just the fourth time I'm
[31:19] speaking on the subject I'm just
[31:21] continuing to get delve a little bit
[31:22] deeper and deeper
[31:27] next time I feel that the Holy Spirit
[31:29] has more for us
[31:33] I'm just going to speak to you for an
[31:36] hour I'm asking for you and divided
[31:37] attention
[31:41] that we just delve right away into the
[31:43] world
[31:45] so the scripture has said
[31:50] amen he says that if they are diligent
[31:58] he will reward them
[32:00] may I tell you tonight that there is
[32:03] nobody that has ever sought God
[32:04] diligently and God never rewarded failed
[32:07] to reward
[32:08] themes
[32:09] [Music]
[32:14] God always rewards those that seek Him
[32:16] diligently
[32:21] but also he says that without faith it
[32:24] is impossible to please him
[33:26] foreign foreign
[34:02] [Applause]
[35:17] the only way of doing it the right way
[35:19] is doing it through faith
[35:25] you can do everything you want to do
[36:02] [Music]
[36:26] foreign you saw a prayed night after
[36:29] night
[36:31] but things are not working because
[36:34] you're not doing it in the right
[36:35] attitude
[36:36] even going to church must be done in the
[36:39] right attitude
[36:41] seeking for anything must be done in the
[36:44] right time
[36:46] if you do it in the right attitude
[36:49] of Faith the Bible says You must find
[36:55] out God
[36:59] hallelujah I mean but what is Faith this
[37:02] is
[37:03] that faith is a revelation
[37:10] I said what is faith
[37:17] is something revealed
[37:21] if if you have a neighbor look to them
[37:23] and tell them faith is something
[37:24] revealed
[38:25] if you pray without faith
[39:13] [Music]
[39:25] from your wife Channel Revelation
[39:28] doesn't come from your boss
[39:30] Revelation
[39:32] comes from God that's God who gives
[39:36] Revelation
[39:37] how does he give it yeah the Bible here
[39:40] says praise the name of the Lord
[39:45] hallelujah glory to God Romans 10 17.
[39:50] it is
[40:05] how do you receive faith when you begin
[40:09] to sit down under the preaching Of The
[40:12] World
[40:15] God used as a preacher
[40:23] the more you hear the words
[40:25] the more faith begins to
[41:23] then you receive something from above

[56:29] expressed his faith
[56:33] by his works

[1:14:19] I mean Jesus says upon this Revelation
[1:14:24] I will rebuild my child
[1:14:32] the girls
[1:14:55] bipolar
[1:14:56] [Applause]
[1:15:04] how many know what that condition is
[1:15:05] bipolar
[1:15:07] praise the name of God if you don't go

[1:15:18] medicine
[1:15:23] he came right in the prayer line
[1:15:26] we were standing there passing me down
[1:15:29] myself and other ministers
[1:15:33] and he he prophesied to that
[1:15:37] I don't know but by the power of the
[1:15:39] Holy Ghost
[1:15:42] I was right there I was in front of him
[1:15:48] this
[1:15:51] bipolarships

[1:16:37] still get done tonight
[1:16:41] let's see so Jesus comes out yes of the
[1:16:45] congregation
[1:16:51] and then John said
[1:16:53] there's a lamb of God
[1:16:58] how do you know him
[1:17:00] um
[1:17:01] he said he that said to me
[1:17:04] in the wilderness
[1:17:06] upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit
[1:17:08] descending
[1:17:11] that's the one that will baptize
[1:17:14] see he knew him
[1:17:17] because there was supposed to be a sign
[1:17:21] about that time
[1:17:24] are you catching it John new you're
[1:17:28] running a mess about the hour
[1:17:30] because he was a prophet it was revealed
[1:17:35] to him but he know would be about that
[1:17:38] time he would see a sign
[1:17:42] and when he's seen that
[1:17:45] signed standing among you
[1:17:49] know it was there
[1:17:51] you must have the word first
[1:17:58] revelation is not presumptuous talking
[1:18:01] face
[1:18:05] no it is
[1:18:11] because God says
[1:18:15] it is revealed to me
[1:18:18] this scripture
[1:18:23] oh I see the signs at the end time is
[1:18:27] here I see that thing that's promised
[1:18:30] for this end time message
[1:18:34] [Music]
[1:18:36] exactly like the scripture says
[1:18:40] oh friends can't you see
[1:18:43] all the end times
[1:18:45] the Bible says that he was in the days
[1:18:56] you know the time
[1:19:00] that was the time
[1:19:05] right in the tent
[1:19:07] um
[1:19:11] right there and you know at that moment
[1:19:13] when those things were happening every
[1:19:15] time we're gonna get a muscle and we see
[1:19:17] the same condition today
[1:19:19] we can I can say by the authority of the
[1:19:22] world
[1:19:23] we are at a time truly movies you know
[1:19:26] closing of the ages
[1:19:29] be like the fools
[1:19:32] who say it has been said
[1:19:38] that the end is coming and Jesus is
[1:19:40] coming it does not happen
[1:19:43] [Music]
[1:19:44] but then it says don't you know with God
[1:19:49] one day is like a thousand years and one
[1:19:51] thousand years
[1:19:55] but for the Believers
[1:20:01] because we are going to see the signs
[1:20:05] one of the signs of the time God said he
[1:20:09] will send a prophet foreign
[1:21:11] foreign
[1:21:22] I saw on the news
[1:21:26] should have been fake news maybe
[1:21:28] because other news agencies have come up
[1:21:31] to say well it is not true
[1:21:35] but if it is not true then why why was
[1:21:38] it there out in the first place
[1:21:41] there's no fire without smoke
[1:21:46] the world is headed for total insanity
[1:22:04] make sector sport
[1:27:23] heard something about water
[1:27:26] into people that live around water
[1:27:28] around more rooms
[1:27:31] I don't think that Peter was a virgin
[1:27:33] this is
[1:27:39] Jesus came yes yes
[1:27:45] and one time when he went back to fish
[1:27:48] before he realized it his pants were
[1:27:51] down he had removed his clothes the
[1:27:54] spirit of the water and when Jesus came
[1:27:57] yes we rushed to dress himself what does
[1:28:01] Jesus intend for us yes send our
[1:28:04] testimony
[1:28:06] to our adventure
[1:28:08] yes
[1:28:18] and it is
[1:28:35] saying this I have it now
[1:28:38] because I have received God's promise
[1:28:41] he is
[1:28:51] wax is not coming out of the abundance
[1:28:54] of what has happened
