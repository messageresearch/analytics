[34:35] hear English and I have a lengthy
[34:37] subject uh just to make sure that I I go
[34:40] through it all we can do that
[34:41] interpretation tonight is that
[34:44] okay uh turn with me to the book of
[34:46] Samuel 1 Samuel chapter 8
[35:00] if you have your Bible with
[35:02] you Samuel is one of the
[35:16] prophets we are reading chapter
[35:19] 8 of 1
[35:22] Samuel verses we will read from verses 1
[35:25] to 7 and then we shall be seated after
[35:27] that
[35:31] and it came to pass when so Samuel was
[35:34] old that he made his sons judges over
[35:38] Israel now the name of his firstborn was
[35:41] Joel and the name of his second ABIA
[35:45] they were judges in BBA and his sons
[35:48] walked not in his ways but turned aside
[35:50] after the laer and and took bribes after
[35:54] L and then took bribes and perverted
[35:57] judgment and when all the Elders of
[36:00] Israel gathered themselves together and
[36:02] came to Samuel unto Rama and said unto
[36:05] him behold Thou Art old and thy Sons
[36:08] walk not in thy ways now make us a king
[36:13] to judge us like all the
[36:16] nations but the thing displeased Samuel
[36:20] when they said give us a king to judge
[36:22] us and Samuel prayed unto the Lord and
[36:25] the Lord said unto Samuel taken unto the
[36:28] voice of the people in all that they say
[36:30] unto thee for they have not rejected
[36:33] thee but they have rejected me that I
[36:36] should not Reign Over them amen you may
[36:39] have your seats may the Lord bless the
[36:40] reading of his word
[36:52] tonight so nice to see uh different ones
[36:55] today that have come to be in the uh
[36:57] part of the service and also those who
[36:59] are online we just greet you all in the
[37:01] name of Jesus Christ so
[37:03] today I want to deal with the subject of
[37:06] the bishop of our
[37:08] souls now uh there has been h a
[37:12] discussion on one of the uh forums uh on
[37:18] WhatsApp some of you I see some of you
[37:20] members on that Forum called the Western
[37:23] Uganda forum and it's BR brought a lot
[37:26] of heartbreaks to some people and
[37:29] sometimes some of them have even been
[37:31] ministers and um they've been dealing
[37:34] with this subject and a lot of young
[37:36] people excited about the subject so one
[37:38] of them actually wrote me today and uh
[37:40] and was pointing me to one of the
[37:42] sermons that uh um one of the pastors
[37:45] was dealing with and he said aha this is
[37:48] what I want you to comment about and so
[37:50] usually I feel a bit timid to comment on
[37:53] such things on public forums I believe
[37:56] that um the WR way to comment on such
[37:58] things the subjects it's um is on the
[38:00] pulpit behind the sacred desk where the
[38:02] Holy Spirit comes and helps
[38:04] us so uh today I want to speak on the
[38:08] bishop of our souls and there's been
[38:11] especially in our generation this is is
[38:13] a subject I want to really approach in
[38:16] um uh a very humble way because our Our
[38:20] Generation has suffered a lot of um uh
[38:25] problems when it comes to
[38:28] uh honor or when it comes to
[38:31] honoring uh uh the men of God or the
[38:33] Servants of God or the officers that God
[38:36] has presented to us as a church recently
[38:39] in my home I was dealing with one of the
[38:42] young men came from Eastern Uganda and
[38:45] he had a lot of resentment for one of
[38:47] the elders and he was you know having a
[38:49] way says okay you can also rebuke an
[38:51] elder you know if he does something
[38:52] wrong but you know I took we almost went
[38:56] uh into the word and we took about 2
[38:59] hours or or even more and he might
[39:02] actually hear this and we were talking
[39:03] about horor and I also uh sent him my my
[39:08] um one of the sermons I preached here
[39:10] and I titled it um sowing uh sowing
[39:16] horor and harvesting access how many
[39:19] remember that yeah so those of you who
[39:22] missed it you should really go back to
[39:23] it we are one of the churches here that
[39:26] really believe in honor in honoring uh
[39:30] each other but also honoring Servants of
[39:32] God and Men of God now if you read the
[39:35] message and if you're really a believer
[39:36] of the message you realize that brother
[39:38] bham was someone that um honored all men
[39:42] of God regardless of whether they were
[39:45] Believers of this message or they were
[39:47] from the denominations brother banam
[39:49] honored them he respected them even when
[39:51] he called them on the microphone maybe
[39:53] to pray for them he would say you you're
[39:55] a man of God or you're a servant of God
[39:56] from such and such a church you would
[39:58] even mention the name of the church
[39:59] where the man of God is coming from
[40:01] sometimes he not even of course it
[40:03] wasn't even Believers of the message of
[40:05] the hour but you see our Prophet honored
[40:08] men of God in his time there were others
[40:11] who was uh God was using in a might way
[40:13] for example there were others like U um
[40:18] Billy Graham there was Tios born at the
[40:21] time T we know much of his Healing
[40:24] Ministry started with brother bham of
[40:26] course but even he was ministering uh
[40:29] during the time before he met brother
[40:30] bham uh there were others like
[40:32] especially Billy Graham and or Roberts
[40:34] these were um having also big campaigns
[40:37] during that time and if you hear how
[40:39] brother bam was of course uh mainly how
[40:42] he was referring to them and talking to
[40:43] them he wasn't trying to show the people
[40:45] that he was the big shot and they were
[40:47] nothing but he was honoring them before
[40:49] his people you would think that if you
[40:51] honor another Minister before your
[40:53] people they will follow the other
[40:54] minister but bam was never bothered by
[40:56] that he knew that if God called him no
[40:59] man can take his place if God called you
[41:02] or calls you no man can take your place
[41:04] and you can't take another man's place
[41:06] so if I stand on the pull pit here and I
[41:07] honor another man of God I Hon another
[41:10] Pastor it doesn't mean that now you know
[41:12] I will get afraid oh people are going to
[41:13] leave my church and I go to that church
[41:15] because I honored the other man you see
[41:17] you have to understand in the economy of
[41:19] God each of us has a place and no man
[41:22] can take your place in your family you
[41:24] know you might be more than one child
[41:26] but no one can take place what God has
[41:28] made you you will be and no one can take
[41:31] or replace you you are the only you that
[41:33] is in the world and you see when you
[41:35] understand that you actually in your own
[41:38] individual life you will learn really
[41:40] honoring people honoring men of God
[41:42] honoring each other honoring your elders
[41:44] especially if someone is older than you
[41:47] to honor them and honor comes in many
[41:49] ways honor comes in you know humbling
[41:51] yourself when you're speaking to
[41:53] somebody it comes when you in some you
[41:56] know you know you bow down a little bit
[41:58] or you kneel or you even give something
[42:00] did you know that even to give someone
[42:02] something is honor and you know we
[42:04] talked about that woman the Queen of
[42:06] Sheba the Queen of Sheba went with a lot
[42:09] of gifts and you know she was going to
[42:10] meet a king King Solomon and uh she did
[42:14] not go empty-handed she went with a lot
[42:17] of gifts and gave it to um to to the
[42:20] King King Solomon and because of these
[42:22] gifts that she went with I believe there
[42:24] must someone must have told the king
[42:26] there is a woman who has come we don't
[42:27] know who she is but she has come with a
[42:29] lot of gifts and the king must up said
[42:31] oh a lot of gifts let her come in I
[42:34] believe those kind of gifts were so big
[42:36] and so much that it even you know the
[42:39] King was so rich King Solomon but those
[42:41] gifts must have uh you know melted the
[42:43] heart of the king to even desire to meet
[42:46] this woman who is she let her come in
[42:48] because of those many things she took
[42:50] and U so she got access to the king and
[42:53] and you know the rest is history we know
[42:56] that uh
[42:57] uh she was the one that um you know is
[43:00] exchanging words with King Solomon in
[43:02] the book of Song of Solomon so we see of
[43:05] course we know that she's typing the
[43:06] bride and Solomon was typing uh typing
[43:09] Christ praise the name of the Lord and
[43:12] so we also see honor of course comes in
[43:14] gifting did you know that even when you
[43:16] come to church and you give your you
[43:18] give an offering you give a tithe you
[43:20] give you know do you know you are
[43:22] honoring God by doing that and that's
[43:24] why we do not want to come to church
[43:25] empty-handed because if if you come
[43:27] empty-handed you are not honoring God by
[43:29] doing that well of course you have
[43:30] honored him by coming to worship him and
[43:33] all that but giving is a part of worship
[43:36] so we see that we honor God by giving we
[43:38] honor him by worshiping him and you
[43:40] cannot say you have woried him in spirit
[43:43] and in truth without giving so giving is
[43:45] part of our worship to God can we say
[43:47] Amen to that well you have to say Amen
[43:49] if what you are hearing is the word of
[43:51] God don't just look at me and be a
[43:52] spectator praise the name of the Lord
[43:55] and so we also realize
[43:57] that um you know uh blessing one another
[44:00] like you can you know if you have some
[44:02] money or you have a cloth or you have
[44:04] something and you give it to a brother
[44:05] you give it to a sister that also is
[44:07] honor and so when you you honor each
[44:10] other or when you honor generally when
[44:12] you honor anyone in life you get access
[44:15] to whatever God has given them and I
[44:17] wish that was is what I was speaking
[44:19] about today but I'm speaking about
[44:20] something else but I say one more thing
[44:22] that sometimes you know when we say
[44:25] honor it's not even you know you know
[44:27] bowing down sometimes it is you know the
[44:30] Bible says that he that receives a
[44:33] prophet in the name of what a prophet
[44:36] receives what the prophet's reward so
[44:39] what is the prophet's reward I believe
[44:41] you know this Prophet God has given him
[44:43] a a blessing God has given him an
[44:45] anointing God has given whatever God has
[44:47] given to him either for you or it is
[44:49] upon his life as an anointing whatever
[44:52] is upon him or them if you honor them
[44:55] God will also place it upon your life or
[44:58] somehow you know you realize that um God
[45:01] can actually uh you know take him and
[45:05] then use him in your life in such a way
[45:07] that you will also feel blessed feel
[45:08] honored by God simply because you
[45:10] honored that
[45:11] Prophet there is a little you know a
[45:14] prophet called Elisha these little boys
[45:17] or little girls whoever they were they
[45:19] were they came running behind him and
[45:21] and shouting because this man had a bold
[45:23] head you know how is it called in
[45:25] luganda a and they were
[45:29] shouting CH man you know he was having a
[45:32] bald head and while they were doing that
[45:34] God was not happy with them of course
[45:37] but God did nothing but here is a
[45:39] prophet a man of God who was
[45:42] anointed you see that anointing upon him
[45:45] could give life and it could also give
[45:47] death H and you see because they
[45:50] approached him in a a wrong way they
[45:53] ashamed him they ridiculed him you know
[45:55] they did not receive the H which was
[45:57] upon his life but they received a curse
[46:00] and he you know he called the Sheep
[46:01] bearers out of the forest and the Sheep
[46:03] bearers two bearers big they came and
[46:05] ate up these children one by one and
[46:07] finished them 40 of them 40 of them so
[46:11] if that could happen I believe if those
[46:13] children had honored that man of God
[46:14] they would have received a blessing so
[46:16] if you receive a a you know a blessing
[46:19] if you receive rather the man of God in
[46:21] the name of that man of God and you
[46:23] honor a man of God or you honor a woman
[46:25] of God a child of God God will give you
[46:27] the blessing that is upon their life or
[46:29] the honor rather the anointing which is
[46:31] upon their life and I was telling this
[46:33] young man I said you saw uh he had seen
[46:36] this interview with one of our uh
[46:38] billionaire brothers from Nigeria so he
[46:41] was like I think Pastor now you have a
[46:43] lot of money I said look this is the
[46:45] problem that we have in Africa we think
[46:48] that when you meet someone who has a lot
[46:50] of money they should give you what they
[46:51] should give you some of their money but
[46:53] listen it is not their it is not my
[46:55] money it is their money I told this
[46:57] brother I actually gave to this brother
[47:01] you see I ought not have said that
[47:03] public but I've already said it so you
[47:05] see I I had to give you see what was I
[47:08] doing I was honoring him I was blessing
[47:10] him and by doing that God has to also
[47:13] bless me with at least something that he
[47:15] has blessed him with so I'm tapping into
[47:17] that anointing I hope this is all right
[47:20] this is not Penta this is Believers this
[47:22] is what we believe praise the name of
[47:24] the Lord and so I believe that members
[47:26] of this church CH young or old you
[47:29] should really honor Elders you should
[47:30] honor men of God a preacher a pastor
[47:32] whoever it is just honor them God will
[47:34] bless you for doing that and so today I
[47:36] just want on that basis to approach this
[47:38] subject um I don't know whether this is
[47:41] the right TI to give it but I just
[47:43] thought I should just throw those words
[47:44] out Bishop of our souls because what was
[47:47] being debated on is oh should we call
[47:49] some believer some uh Brothers Bishops
[47:51] or some others are calling themselves
[47:53] bishop or it is wrong to call each other
[47:54] bishop and things like that but um um
[47:57] this I I just want to approach it this
[47:59] way here is a man of God Samuel a
[48:02] prophet of of God of course from the
[48:04] time God had made Israel a nation or God
[48:07] had called them and called them his
[48:09] people God was using prophets God was
[48:11] using men of God and we see that Samuel
[48:13] was one of them and God was judging
[48:16] Israel using a prophet now a prophet is
[48:18] a man that God was speaking to and now
[48:21] this man would bring the mind of God to
[48:22] the people and so he was more like a
[48:25] king Prophet so you see was having all
[48:27] those offices Israel did not have a king
[48:30] like the rest of the tribes like the
[48:31] rest of the Nations around them so they
[48:33] had only a prophet and so now as Samuel
[48:37] became old they um he um made the Bible
[48:41] says he made his sons judges judges over
[48:45] Israel like leaders you know he kind of
[48:47] delegated authority that he had upon his
[48:50] sons and one of them was Joel the
[48:52] firstborn another one the second one was
[48:54] ABIA and and so they were judges in
[48:58] BBA and the Bible says that his sons
[49:01] walked not in his ways of course this
[49:03] was a man of God called by God anointed
[49:05] by God having the spirit of God upon him
[49:07] he was an elder among them but you see
[49:10] they honored him they respected him but
[49:12] now when he delegated the authority to
[49:14] these other young men this young man did
[49:17] not walk in his way the ways of his
[49:19] father and so these men felt so bad they
[49:22] said no no no no we cannot accept we
[49:24] cannot accept such younger men to rule
[49:27] over us or to lead us to mislead us when
[49:29] we can also do something about it so
[49:32] they connived among themselves they came
[49:34] together and they all agreed they said
[49:36] we now need from today we need a king
[49:38] over us just like other nations around
[49:41] us you see we need a king and so they uh
[49:44] they came to Samuel and they told him
[49:45] look Samuel I think you're now growing
[49:48] old and now you you know your sons are
[49:51] not leading Us in the ways that you have
[49:53] been leading us we want a king to judge
[49:56] over us
[49:57] now I do not know it's a matter of
[50:00] debate uh on the issue of the sons of
[50:03] Samuel now I believe the sons of Samuel
[50:06] I don't know whether it was God who told
[50:08] Samuel to do it or it was Samuel who did
[50:10] it on his own I don't know but let me
[50:12] tell you Brethren God always wants you
[50:15] to honor his servants if a man of God
[50:17] Rises up and you believe him as a man of
[50:19] God well even if he makes a mistake in
[50:22] fact there is a quote where brother bam
[50:24] says if your pastor comes up raises up
[50:26] receive him as a man of God even if it
[50:29] says no matter what he does if you
[50:31] respect him in that category in that
[50:34] office you are receiving him as that
[50:36] office God will respect you for doing so
[50:40] so you see he says no matter what he
[50:41] does why because God understands that
[50:44] Servants of God pastors whatever
[50:46] preachers they are also human beings and
[50:48] they can actually make a mistake but you
[50:50] see if you receive him you're not
[50:52] receiving a man of God because he's
[50:54] perfect because he has never done
[50:56] anything wrong wrong or said anything
[50:57] wrong actually many times even here on
[50:59] the pulpit we miss say things or say
[51:01] things the wrong way but you see you
[51:03] understand and say well I receive it
[51:04] because he's a man of God but I
[51:06] understand what he was saying there is
[51:07] actually a sister here who corrected me
[51:10] I miss said some scripture and and you
[51:12] know I uh what scripture was that
[51:14] sister yeah remind me because I needed
[51:16] to correct it I forgot also to correct
[51:18] it when I came back on the other Sunday
[51:20] she doesn't want to to to be recognized
[51:22] but um there's a scripture I think I was
[51:24] I don't now remember what was I speaking
[51:26] about let me to remember I was speaking
[51:28] about
[51:30] um oh I just if I remember it I'll let
[51:33] you know but she came up and corrected
[51:34] me and said pastor that that was not
[51:36] supposed to be this it was supposed to
[51:38] be I said oh yes it was supposed to be
[51:40] that way I miss said it but you see she
[51:42] doesn't now say oh no he's not he's no
[51:44] longer my pastor actually because you
[51:46] know no you respect him as long as God
[51:49] has put him in that office there is an
[51:51] anointing upon him in that office and if
[51:53] you respect that anointing God will
[51:55] honor you for doing so
[51:57] and so we notice here that I don't know
[51:59] whether the man of God had made a
[52:00] mistake or not but you see he made his
[52:02] sons um uh you know judges and they
[52:05] misid things and they did wrong things
[52:07] and so people came up and they said we
[52:09] no longer now want these judges and we
[52:11] no longer want you some to be a prophet
[52:13] to us and things like that we actually
[52:16] want a king over us like the other
[52:18] nations and um Samuel said all right
[52:21] it's okay I've heard your request let me
[52:23] go to God and Samuel went to God and
[52:25] when he asked from the the Lord the Lord
[52:27] told him hacken unto the voice of the
[52:30] people in all that they have said unto
[52:31] thee for they have not rejected thee but
[52:34] they have rejected me in other words God
[52:38] was identifying himself with the office
[52:41] and position and calling of Samuel and
[52:44] he's saying well by rejecting you the
[52:47] prophet they have rejected
[52:49] me and he says I should not Reign Over
[52:52] them so was God reigning over them was
[52:55] God ruling over them yes was God ruling
[52:58] over them yes but how was he ruling over
[53:00] them he was ruling over them using a man
[53:03] of God so right before I even continue I
[53:07] want to say God is our Bishop God is our
[53:10] leader God is the one who rules over us
[53:13] but God always uses human
[53:15] beings without a human being God can do
[53:19] nothing in the Book of Amos 3:7 it says
[53:22] you know um you know you know surely the
[53:25] Lord God will do nothing but he
[53:26] revealeth his secrets to his servants
[53:29] the
[53:30] prophets praise the name of the Lord and
[53:33] so uh in Psalms
[53:35] 118:8 and please I just want you to
[53:37] follow me because this is some kind of
[53:39] um a teaching in a way I'm just going to
[53:41] read a lot of quotes and I want you to
[53:42] follow me and follow the trend of
[53:44] thought in the Book of Psalms 118:8 it
[53:47] says it is a it is better to trust in
[53:50] the Lord than to put confidence in man
[53:53] it is better to trust in the Lord than
[53:56] to put confidence in Princess hallelujah
[53:58] how many believe
[54:00] that it is better to trust in the Lord I
[54:03] always say and I always tell people do
[54:05] not trust in a man but trust in that in
[54:08] the god in that man because you see that
[54:11] is why it is very dangerous for a
[54:13] Believer to marry an unbeliever because
[54:15] you see if you marry an unbeliever how
[54:17] can you trust them where is your
[54:19] confidence our confidence is not in
[54:21] people our confidence is in God but you
[54:24] see God uses people and if uses if God
[54:27] is so confident in a man then I'm also
[54:30] so confident trusting in that man that
[54:32] God has sent why because I'm not
[54:34] trusting in the man but I'm actually
[54:35] trusting in the god of that man William
[54:38] Bram was a man but why do we believe him
[54:40] as a prophet because God Amen had
[54:43] confidence in him God stood Amen in a
[54:46] pill of fire and was just right there to
[54:47] prove that look I am with with this man
[54:50] so anybody who wouldn't believe in him
[54:52] as a messenger of Our Generation doesn't
[54:55] have confidence in God amen when God
[54:57] sent Samuel whoever did not believe in
[55:00] Samuel did not actually believe in God
[55:02] that's how God operates that is how his
[55:05] word operates and as Believers we want
[55:07] to believe everything that God says in
[55:09] his word we have we want to have
[55:11] confidence in God not confidence in man
[55:14] and you see by the way the difference
[55:15] the major
[55:17] difference between denominations and the
[55:20] message is denomination trust in man but
[55:24] the message we trust in God as I would
[55:26] show you later on you see we don't trust
[55:28] in man we trust in God the Catholic
[55:31] Church they they choose their Pope and
[55:33] the man leads them and they choose
[55:35] another one and even in these other
[55:37] churches they choose men and they send
[55:38] this one over there they send this one
[55:40] over there and you know there's one man
[55:42] maybe in a headquarter you know
[55:43] controlling everything but the Believers
[55:45] work and operate differently because the
[55:47] bishop of our souls as I will show you
[55:49] later is Jesus Christ now I want you to
[55:52] see in the message the rejected King the
[55:55] rejected King 196 if you can get this
[55:57] course it will be all right brother
[55:59] Marvin he says but still it isn't the
[56:02] will of God that man should rule over
[56:06] man I did not hear any
[56:08] amen it is not the will of God that what
[56:12] man should rule over man God sent on the
[56:17] day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost to rule
[56:19] in man's hearts and rule in his life it
[56:23] was not meant for man to rule over
[56:26] man but we love to say that it's a very
[56:29] outstanding thing when we can say we
[56:32] belong to such a great
[56:34] organization that is why it is something
[56:36] very confusing for people when they hear
[56:39] about us and they ask us where is your
[56:41] headquarter and we tell them our
[56:43] headquarters in heaven they would say
[56:44] what so you mean you have no Archbishop
[56:46] we said no we have no Arch Bishop so
[56:48] what is wrong with you how I mean they
[56:50] don't how someone asked me how do you
[56:52] even you know correct each other when
[56:54] they mistakes when they the wrong things
[56:55] when a person makes a mistake they can't
[56:58] understand that actually God wants to
[57:00] have the Holy Spirit ruling in many's
[57:03] Hearts if it is the holy spirit ruling
[57:06] in many's Hearts then we don't need all
[57:08] these kind of organizations because it
[57:10] is God ruling his own church from the
[57:13] very beginning that is how it has
[57:15] been now as I'm building I want you to
[57:18] follow me closely because you see to
[57:20] miss this he like walking on a razor
[57:23] blades age you can go the other side or
[57:26] go the other side I want you to really
[57:28] follow me closely if you have notes a
[57:31] pen and a paper you can write some of
[57:33] these quotes or scriptures and then read
[57:35] it later listen it says in the message
[57:38] the rejected King he says do you see the
[57:41] holy spirit is our judge God never give
[57:44] us a pope or a bishop amen or anybody
[57:49] Amen to be a judge the Holy Spirit the
[57:53] person of God in the form of the Holy SP
[57:56] spirit is our judge and our guide how
[57:59] many believe that from the time the
[58:02] Israelites desired a king they had
[58:04] rejected God a king is someone who would
[58:07] rule them after the desire of his own
[58:11] heart not after the desire of God but
[58:14] after the desire of his own heart now
[58:16] you have to understand when we talk
[58:18] about a king or when we talk about these
[58:21] Bishops of the world and um and you know
[58:23] the the the judges and things like that
[58:26] these are people who rule according to
[58:28] the desire you just look at um I read
[58:31] this for you in one of the services look
[58:32] at First Kings
[58:34] 11:37 he says and I will take thee now
[58:37] this is when aijah Prophet aijah was
[58:39] speaking to jeroboam you remember
[58:41] Prophet are he just speaking to jeroboam
[58:44] uh when God was promising jeroboam that
[58:46] he will give him the kingdom uh if he
[58:49] walks in the ways of of of David so he
[58:52] said and I will take thee and thou shalt
[58:54] Reign according to all that thy Soul
[58:58] desires and sh be king over Israel there
[59:01] many many things I want to say today but
[59:03] I want you to give me your undivided
[59:04] attention and follow closely but also
[59:06] say Amen so I can be able to
[59:08] continue so we see here that um um this
[59:13] is Prophet aijah when he he gave this
[59:15] prophecy what did he tell uh the man
[59:18] jeroboam he told him you see I will take
[59:22] thee now God was telling him if you do
[59:24] this if you do this all right then I
[59:25] will will take thee meaning jeroboam and
[59:28] you will reign you meaning You Will Rule
[59:32] according to what to what God desires
[59:34] according to thy
[59:37] Soul
[59:38] desire and shall be king over Israel now
[59:41] you have to understand a king is not
[59:44] always aligned with God's will a king
[59:49] has his own will as much as a prophet
[59:52] does not have his own will a prophet
[59:55] always has the will of God a man of God
[59:58] who is sent by God ordained by God
[1:00:01] Sanctified by God anointed by God always
[1:00:04] has the will of God but a king who is
[1:00:07] chosen by people elected by people
[1:00:10] always has his own will you go back in
[1:00:13] the Bible in the book of Acts you'll see
[1:00:15] this man who was he even was he Matthew
[1:00:17] what was his name that he that was
[1:00:19] elected by the disciples to replace
[1:00:21] Judas how many remember his name what
[1:00:23] was it was he
[1:00:26] Matthews it was
[1:00:30] Matthew say that again
[1:00:33] brother Matas I think that's another
[1:00:36] language matus Matthew matthus okay he
[1:00:40] was called Matas yes other language they
[1:00:42] called him maansi but it's the same
[1:00:44] thing matus so you see matthus how many
[1:00:47] know what brother matus did in the Bible
[1:00:49] we don't even know anything about
[1:00:50] brother matthus and because why mathus
[1:00:54] was voted by people
[1:00:56] matus was go was man
[1:00:59] elected but you see God chose one man
[1:01:02] and his name was Paul see how much Paul
[1:01:05] did see how much destruction he brought
[1:01:07] to the kingdom of darkness why because
[1:01:09] Paul was elected or voted and sent out
[1:01:12] by
[1:01:13] God so you see God wants to lead his own
[1:01:17] people using his own people that he has
[1:01:20] anointed and he sent out okay now I want
[1:01:23] you to follow closely here a king King
[1:01:26] when he he's a king he should rule
[1:01:28] usually Kings rule according to the
[1:01:30] desires of their own Hearts not
[1:01:32] according to the will of God but
[1:01:33] according to the desires of their own
[1:01:35] hearts and that's how the Bishops of the
[1:01:37] denominations are it's according to the
[1:01:38] desires of their own hearts and maybe
[1:01:40] their Church uh kind of uh agreements
[1:01:42] and things like that not according to
[1:01:44] the word of God the will of God that's
[1:01:45] why many times they mislead people from
[1:01:47] the word of God to their own church
[1:01:48] doctrines because they are there to
[1:01:50] guard their Church doctrines not the
[1:01:52] word of
[1:01:53] God now I want you to to take your Bible
[1:01:57] with me to the book of 1 Samuel and we
[1:02:00] are going to look at
[1:02:04] um at we are going to continue looking
[1:02:06] at those words that um Samuel spoke when
[1:02:10] they said they needed a king I want you
[1:02:12] to see the response of God H to um to to
[1:02:17] these people in verses chapter 8 in
[1:02:20] verses
[1:02:22] 9 praise the name of the Lord
[1:02:29] you will find this very amazing very
[1:02:32] very amazing uh chapter 8:
[1:02:36] 9
[1:02:37] now therefore Heen unto their voice now
[1:02:41] this is God telling Samuel prophet
[1:02:42] Samuel to to listen to the people he
[1:02:45] says listen to them but yet protest
[1:02:48] Solly unto them and show them the manner
[1:02:51] of the king that shall reign over them
[1:02:53] uhhuh he says Now do not you just listen
[1:02:57] to what they telling you listen to them
[1:02:59] but also tell them about the person that
[1:03:02] is going to R to rule over them look at
[1:03:04] verse
[1:03:06] 10 he says and Samuel told all the words
[1:03:12] of the Lord unto the people now it isn't
[1:03:15] it amazing by the way that prophet
[1:03:18] Samuel God does not God did not explain
[1:03:21] just please listen to me God did not
[1:03:23] explain to prophet Samuel how this King
[1:03:26] will be but prophet Samuel was so much
[1:03:29] aligned with God that he knew the mind
[1:03:31] of God about how those King Kings will
[1:03:33] rule the people and I wanted to hear the
[1:03:35] next words on how he spoke to them and
[1:03:37] Samuel told all the words of the Lord
[1:03:39] unto the people that asked him of a king
[1:03:41] and he said this will be the manner of
[1:03:44] the king that shall reign over you he
[1:03:47] will take your sons and appoint them for
[1:03:50] himself for his chariots and to be his
[1:03:54] Horsemen and some shall run before his
[1:03:57] chariots and he will appoint him
[1:03:59] captains over thousands and captains
[1:04:02] over 50s and will set them to ear his
[1:04:06] ground and to reap his Harvest and to
[1:04:09] make his instruments of war and
[1:04:11] instruments of his chariots and he will
[1:04:14] take your daughters to be
[1:04:15] confectionaries and to be cooks and to
[1:04:18] be
[1:04:19] Bakers and he will take your fields and
[1:04:21] your vineard and your olivard even the
[1:04:25] best of of them and give them to his
[1:04:27] servants and he will take the tenth of
[1:04:30] your seed and of your Vineyards and give
[1:04:32] to his officers andto his servants you
[1:04:35] see the authority of um of a king that
[1:04:39] did not come from God but a king that
[1:04:41] the people
[1:04:43] desired H and that's how the generations
[1:04:46] are our generation you know the
[1:04:47] denominations the Bible says they have
[1:04:49] heed upon themselves teachers having
[1:04:52] itching ears you know people that will
[1:04:55] tell them what they want to hear they
[1:04:57] will vote them into Power into Ministry
[1:04:59] be our Bishop be our this be our that be
[1:05:01] our pastor and he will take your men
[1:05:04] servants and your maid servants and your
[1:05:07] goodliest young men and your asses and
[1:05:11] put them to his work he will take the
[1:05:14] tenth of your sheep and ye shall be his
[1:05:17] servants and ye shall cry out in that
[1:05:20] day because of your king which ye shall
[1:05:22] have chosen which ye shall have chosen
[1:05:26] uh uh all right let me read that again
[1:05:29] and ye shall cry out in that day because
[1:05:31] of your king which ye uh shall have
[1:05:34] chosen and the Lord will not hear you in
[1:05:37] that day nevertheless the people refuse
[1:05:41] to obey the voice of Samuel and they say
[1:05:44] nay but we will have a king over
[1:05:48] us this is how the people are they
[1:05:50] cannot be in a church without a bishop
[1:05:52] they cannot be in a church without a
[1:05:54] hierarchy without you know this kind of
[1:05:56] you know headquarters this and that that
[1:05:58] and that and that and that and that and
[1:05:59] they feel that we message Believers are
[1:06:01] losers because there some of them even
[1:06:04] say we are you know others say we are a
[1:06:07] c because we don't have a hierarchy we
[1:06:09] don't have a headquarter they want our
[1:06:10] headquar to be somewhere in America our
[1:06:13] headquarter is in
[1:06:14] heaven Hallelujah all over the world we
[1:06:18] are one
[1:06:19] body Hallelujah and so the people have
[1:06:23] always desired that and this is what God
[1:06:25] told them if you put if you choose a man
[1:06:28] and you make him a you know a bishop or
[1:06:30] or a king I keep using the word Bishop
[1:06:32] which means overseer which means like a
[1:06:34] king and I'll get into that a little bit
[1:06:36] later on and he says you see and you
[1:06:39] choose a man over you and make him a
[1:06:41] king over you you know he's going to do
[1:06:43] all these things to you he's going to
[1:06:45] make you suffer he's going to use you
[1:06:47] he's going to you know make you servants
[1:06:49] he's going to even take from you and
[1:06:52] steal from you and things which belong
[1:06:54] to you and um you know he he he will
[1:06:58] make you cry he says he will make you
[1:07:00] cry out in that
[1:07:02] day but God will not hear you but they
[1:07:06] still said huh we have heard but still
[1:07:08] we want a
[1:07:10] king and God gave them what a king but I
[1:07:14] want to show you where our King is in
[1:07:16] the book of 1 Peter chapter 2:
[1:07:21] 21 for even here too where you he called
[1:07:26] because Christ also suffered for us
[1:07:29] leaving us an example that he should
[1:07:32] follow his steps who did not sin neither
[1:07:36] was gu found in his mouth he's talking
[1:07:39] about our King friends
[1:07:41] Hallelujah who did not sin oh my the
[1:07:44] other king would make you suffer would
[1:07:46] make you do this would make you suff but
[1:07:48] you you know what our King did he did
[1:07:50] not sin neither was God found in his
[1:07:52] mouth who when he was reviled revived
[1:07:55] not again
[1:07:56] when he suffered he threatened not but
[1:07:58] committed himself to him that judged
[1:08:03] righteously who his own bear his own
[1:08:07] self bear our sins instead of putting
[1:08:10] sins on us he Beed he took our sins upon
[1:08:14] himself in his own body on the tree that
[1:08:18] we being dead to sins should live un
[1:08:22] righteousness by whose Stripes ye were
[1:08:26] healed for ye were as sheep going astray
[1:08:29] but now you are returned unto the
[1:08:32] shepherd and Bishop of your
[1:08:35] souls
[1:08:37] Hallelujah so now Jesus Christ the one
[1:08:40] who suffered he became a servant and the
[1:08:43] Bible says he that became a servant he
[1:08:45] that took his sins our sins upon him he
[1:08:48] is actually the bishop of our
[1:08:51] Souls praise the name of the Lord and so
[1:08:54] now I'm going to read two significant
[1:08:56] quotes Okay and others as well but two
[1:09:00] significant quotes one from the paman
[1:09:01] church age and another from the Ephesian
[1:09:03] Church age and I want you to follow
[1:09:04] through with each of them because you
[1:09:06] see if you just leave right now you will
[1:09:08] miss I want you to join everything okay
[1:09:12] uh let's first go through with it in in
[1:09:15] the pamman church age I'll just begin
[1:09:18] reading from somewhere he says you will
[1:09:20] recall that I brought out in the
[1:09:22] Ephesian Church age that the word
[1:09:28] nicolon the word
[1:09:30] nicolan comes from two Greek words Nik
[1:09:35] which means to conquer and la which
[1:09:37] means the
[1:09:38] L okay nikol means to conquer
[1:09:50] the are you now seeing are you
[1:09:53] connecting here it is just like the king
[1:09:56] that Israelites said we want you to have
[1:09:59] give us a king So now there would come
[1:10:01] somebody having a spirit of nicolan
[1:10:03] wanting to conquer the lady that's why
[1:10:06] we don't have such things in the message
[1:10:08] churches where you have a bishop saying
[1:10:10] you go to that church you come out from
[1:10:12] that church you do that you this one
[1:10:15] remove him this one you know no we don't
[1:10:17] have things like that why because you
[1:10:20] see the denomination people have it
[1:10:23] because for them they have this Spirit
[1:10:25] of nicolan ruling over them in their
[1:10:29] churches okay listen
[1:10:32] carefully Nika which means to conquer
[1:10:35] and Laos which which means the lady
[1:10:37] nicolan means to conquer the lady now
[1:10:41] why is this such a terrible
[1:10:43] thing it is terrible because God has
[1:10:46] placed God sorry God has never place his
[1:10:49] church in the hands of an elected
[1:10:52] leadership which moves with political
[1:10:54] mind edness you have to shout Amen on
[1:10:58] that God has never placed a church his
[1:11:02] church in the hands of people with a
[1:11:05] mind of politics church is not run by
[1:11:09] politics or political mind church is led
[1:11:13] by God the bishop of our
[1:11:16] souls and you know he says he has bless
[1:11:19] his church in the care of God ordained
[1:11:23] spirit filled word living
[1:11:26] men who lead the people through feeding
[1:11:30] them the
[1:11:31] word so you see how God was using Samuel
[1:11:35] Samuel was spirit filled Samuel was God
[1:11:38] ordained Hallelujah Samuel was wor
[1:11:40] living and because of that God was using
[1:11:43] him and now here we are saying the same
[1:11:45] brother is saying the same thing God is
[1:11:47] doing today God always puts his church
[1:11:49] in the hands of God ordained spirit
[1:11:52] filled wory living man
[1:11:56] so men Yes Men we'll come to that later
[1:12:00] on who lead the people through feeding
[1:12:02] them the word not saying I am your
[1:12:05] pastor do that I am your pastor leave
[1:12:07] that woman and marry and take this one
[1:12:09] leave that man is not your husband take
[1:12:10] this one you
[1:12:12] see why why did you divorce you know my
[1:12:15] Bishop told me my pastor told me my my
[1:12:18] overseer General overse told me for us
[1:12:20] we are liberated from those things
[1:12:23] Hallelujah the has set us free from
[1:12:27] denominations and the speed of nanism
[1:12:31] Hallelujah he has not separated the
[1:12:34] people into classes so that the masses
[1:12:37] are led by our holy
[1:12:39] priesthood it is true that the
[1:12:41] leadership must be holy but then so must
[1:12:44] be the whole congregation we have
[1:12:46] nothing like the holy priesthood like
[1:12:49] they have in Roman Catholicism or or
[1:12:51] Orthodox or whatever they are the holy
[1:12:53] ones they don't even marry and yet they
[1:12:55] so full of
[1:12:56] hypocrisy they said they don't marry but
[1:12:59] you see the many of them they after they
[1:13:01] they are dead people realize that oh
[1:13:03] they had a wife and the children
[1:13:05] actually these days they even
[1:13:16] know
[1:13:17] know the public you see the other is the
[1:13:20] wife of the father so-call father the
[1:13:23] Bible says called no man father on Earth
[1:13:25] I am the he's the only our heavenly
[1:13:27] father but you see they have wives here
[1:13:30] on Earth and yet they claim publicly
[1:13:34] that they don't marry because they are
[1:13:36] living a Celebrate life for the sake of
[1:13:38] the Gospel but that's why even the book
[1:13:40] of First Timothy he said what he I think
[1:13:42] it is second Timothy somewhere I wish I
[1:13:45] would get it quickly is chapter 4 second
[1:13:47] someone could quickly check it for us he
[1:13:49] said you see they do it in
[1:13:52] hypocrisy in hypocrisy they are not tell
[1:13:55] in the truth they forbid to marry they
[1:13:58] they they forbid to they tell people to
[1:14:00] abstain from certain Meats they do it
[1:14:02] what in
[1:14:03] hypocrisy praise the name of the
[1:14:07] Lord okay I don't know whether it is
[1:14:09] chapter chapter 2 is it chapter
[1:14:15] two okay let me let me get it for you
[1:14:17] here because I thought it is a a very
[1:14:20] good one some of those quotes when you
[1:14:21] speak it it's good to uh give the people
[1:14:26] a
[1:14:28] quot did you get
[1:14:30] it 1 Timothy chapter 4 oh yeah I I had
[1:14:34] gone to 2 Timothy chter 4 vers um vers 2
[1:14:39] now the spirit speaketh expressly that
[1:14:42] in the latter times some shall depart
[1:14:44] from the faith giving he to seducing
[1:14:46] spirits and doctrines of
[1:14:48] devils speaking lies in
[1:14:51] hypocrisy having their conscience seared
[1:14:54] with with a hot iron forbidding to marry
[1:14:57] commanding to abstain from Meats which
[1:15:00] God has created to be received with
[1:15:02] Thanksgiving of them which believe and
[1:15:04] know the truth for every creature of God
[1:15:07] is good and nothing to be refused if it
[1:15:10] is received with Thanksgiving for it is
[1:15:13] Sanctified by the word of God and
[1:15:16] prayer that's why for us we eat
[1:15:18] everything including pork amen and
[1:15:22] that's why we marry we don't forbid
[1:15:23] people to marry but you see they forbid
[1:15:25] to marry they they tell people to absend
[1:15:28] from me but they do it in hypocrisy
[1:15:30] because they go behind and do those
[1:15:32] things which they told people they
[1:15:33] shouldn't do them you see this is what
[1:15:35] happens with these kind of of of of
[1:15:38] leaders you see but a prophet goes ahead
[1:15:41] to say father there is no place in the
[1:15:44] world where priests or ministers or such
[1:15:48] mediate between God and the
[1:15:50] people no nor is there a place where
[1:15:54] they are separated in their worship of
[1:15:56] the Lord God wants all to love and to
[1:15:59] serve him together can you say Amen to
[1:16:01] that he says listen
[1:16:04] nanism destroys those precepts and
[1:16:07] instead separates the ministers from the
[1:16:10] people and makes the leaders overlords
[1:16:14] instead of servants Jesus is the bishop
[1:16:16] of our soul but he was a
[1:16:18] servant all preachers all men of God all
[1:16:21] pastors all Bishops should be servants
[1:16:25] yes now this Doctrine actually started
[1:16:29] as a deed in the first age it appears
[1:16:31] that the problem lay in those two words
[1:16:34] Elders which means preceptors and
[1:16:37] overseers which means Bishops now I want
[1:16:40] you to see the meaning of these two
[1:16:42] words says though scriptures shows that
[1:16:46] there are several Elders in each Church
[1:16:49] some began ignaas among them to teach
[1:16:52] that the idea of a bishop was one of
[1:16:56] preeminence or authority and control
[1:16:59] over the
[1:17:03] elders now the truth of the matter is
[1:17:07] the word Elder signifies who the person
[1:17:11] is while the word Bishop signifies the
[1:17:14] office of the same man yes sir so the
[1:17:19] the Elder is the pastor but also he says
[1:17:22] it is who he is right the Elder is an
[1:17:24] elder we will see here he explains later
[1:17:27] on who the Elder is but you see he says
[1:17:30] the Elder is the man and and Bishop is
[1:17:33] the office of the same
[1:17:36] man that is why in first Timothy chapter
[1:17:39] 3 I believe he says this is a true
[1:17:41] saying if a man desire the office of a
[1:17:45] bishop he desires a good work and then
[1:17:47] he begins to talk about the qu
[1:17:49] qualifications of a bishop you see the
[1:17:51] bishop is an
[1:17:53] office he says the Elder is the man
[1:17:56] Bishop is the office of the man Elder
[1:17:58] always has and always will refer simply
[1:18:01] to a man's chronological age in the Lord
[1:18:05] am he is an elder not because he is
[1:18:09] elected ordained Etc but because he is
[1:18:13] older okay so for instance you know a
[1:18:17] man goes and starts a Ministry and you
[1:18:19] know he B many children in the Lord and
[1:18:21] you know you see him as an elder some
[1:18:24] times you know God has given me that
[1:18:27] privilege of being an elder both in
[1:18:29] Ethiopia also here and sometimes you
[1:18:31] realize that even the people that see
[1:18:33] you as an elder you they actually older
[1:18:35] than you in age but he not talking about
[1:18:38] the age of the world he's not saying an
[1:18:40] elder with beards white beard gray
[1:18:43] beards and you know having a stick you
[1:18:45] know he's an elder he's talking about
[1:18:47] the age in the Lord not a novice an
[1:18:49] older man in the Lord or in the ministry
[1:18:54] he he's about an elder his chronological
[1:19:05] age he is an elder not because he is
[1:19:08] elected or ordained but because he is
[1:19:11] older he is more seon so you can even
[1:19:14] have more Elders actually in the church
[1:19:16] who are not even
[1:19:17] pastors you see because they are older
[1:19:20] in the Lord and many times you look up
[1:19:22] to them oh this is an elder in the
[1:19:23] church not because he order but because
[1:19:25] he's he's been in the in the in the
[1:19:27] truth for a long time and sometimes they
[1:19:31] the deacons and so forth now listen he's
[1:19:33] an elder not because he's elected
[1:19:35] ordained Etc but because he's older he
[1:19:37] is more seasoned he is more trained not
[1:19:40] an noice reliable because of experience
[1:19:44] and long-standing proof of his Christian
[1:19:47] experience but no the Bishops did not
[1:19:50] stick to the Epistles of Paul but rather
[1:19:53] they went to Paul's account of the time
[1:19:54] he called the elders from Ephesus to
[1:19:56] meitus in Acts 20 in verse 17 record
[1:20:00] States Elders were called and then in
[1:20:02] vers 28 they are called
[1:20:08] overseers now if you look in Acts 20: 17
[1:20:12] here they call them elders but in vers
[1:20:14] 28 they call them overseers same people
[1:20:17] so these these these Elders were also
[1:20:20] the same people who were called Bishops
[1:20:22] or overseers bishop and overseer means
[1:20:23] the same thing because they were
[1:20:26] overseers of Bishops of some Churches
[1:20:28] there and these Bishops no doubt
[1:20:30] politically minded he's talking about
[1:20:32] the other wrong kind of Bishops with the
[1:20:33] wrong kind of mind set and these Bishops
[1:20:36] no doubt politically minded and anxious
[1:20:39] for power insisted that Paul had given
[1:20:42] the meaning that overseers now now first
[1:20:46] of all before I continue There is the
[1:20:47] right kind of Bishops scriptural
[1:20:50] bibilical and the wrong kind of Bishops
[1:20:53] that's why I said it is like working on
[1:20:54] a res Ed you can miss it there's the
[1:20:56] right kind of way of looking at it and
[1:20:59] the wrong kind of way of looking at it
[1:21:01] now brother bam here is explaining to us
[1:21:04] the the the what they thought which was
[1:21:06] actually the wrong kind of way he says
[1:21:10] listen there were more than local um he
[1:21:13] says insisted that Paul had given the
[1:21:15] meaning that overseers were more than
[1:21:17] the local Elder with official capacity
[1:21:20] only in his own church to them so in
[1:21:24] other words these people these false
[1:21:26] Elders or these bishops from the false
[1:21:28] Church system were insisting that the
[1:21:32] word bishop or overseer was meaning a
[1:21:36] man who had more
[1:21:39] Authority surpassing his own local
[1:21:41] church to control other pastors of other
[1:21:45] local churches so to them a bishop was
[1:21:48] now one with extended authority over
[1:21:51] many local
[1:21:52] Elders such a concept was neither
[1:21:56] scriptural nor
[1:21:58] historical yet even a man of the sture
[1:22:00] of polyup do you know polyup was
[1:22:02] supposed to be the messenger of the
[1:22:04] second Church age but he was scrapped
[1:22:06] off and he ran as his student became the
[1:22:09] messenger of the second Church age why
[1:22:11] because he did not lean towards this
[1:22:13] idea and this kind of spirit of nanism
[1:22:16] he says but even a man of the state of
[1:22:18] Poa leaned toward such organization thus
[1:22:22] that which started as a deed in the
[1:22:24] first age was made a little Doctrine and
[1:22:27] so it is
[1:22:28] today Bishops still claim power to
[1:22:31] control men and to deal with them as
[1:22:34] they desire you remember now the idea of
[1:22:37] the kingdom and kingship you know they
[1:22:39] have that idea that this is my kingdom
[1:22:41] and they rule this and rule that and
[1:22:42] tell this and do that this according to
[1:22:44] their own desire blessing them where
[1:22:46] they saw Will in the ministry this
[1:22:49] denies the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:53] who said separate me Paul and Barnabas
[1:22:55] for the work where unto I have called
[1:22:58] them this is anti- word and
[1:23:03] Antichrist the prophet says you see this
[1:23:05] kind of idea to think that a bishop is
[1:23:07] one that has a power to control men and
[1:23:10] to deal with them as he desires telling
[1:23:12] placing this one there placing another
[1:23:13] here denying one leadership here you
[1:23:16] know it is denying the Holy Ghost
[1:23:19] leadership to the church because it's
[1:23:21] the Holy Spirit who actually spoke and
[1:23:23] said separate me Paul and Barnabas how
[1:23:25] does he speak he speaks through gifts he
[1:23:28] speaks through his word he speaks
[1:23:30] through the Holy Ghost but to go against
[1:23:33] that is anti- word and his
[1:23:35] Antichrist Matthew 20:25 he says but
[1:23:38] Jesus called unto
[1:23:40] them uh called them unto him and said ye
[1:23:44] know that the princes of the Gentiles
[1:23:46] exercise dominion over them and they
[1:23:48] that are great exercise Authority upon
[1:23:52] them but it shall not be so among you
[1:23:55] you didn't hear that let me read it
[1:23:56] again but Jesus called unto them called
[1:23:59] them unto him and said ye know that the
[1:24:03] princes meaning the Kings and all that
[1:24:05] of the Gentiles exercise dominion over
[1:24:07] them over the people and they that are
[1:24:10] great exercise Authority upon them the
[1:24:12] people but it shall not be so among
[1:24:16] you but whosoever will be greater among
[1:24:19] you let him be your
[1:24:22] minister and whosoever will be Chief
[1:24:25] among you let him be your
[1:24:27] servant even as the son of man came not
[1:24:30] to be ministered unto but he came to
[1:24:33] minister to give his life for a ransom
[1:24:35] for many by the way this is what we
[1:24:38] believe
[1:24:40] Hallelujah we don't believe in men
[1:24:42] exercising authority over the others
[1:24:44] politically We Believe Amen in men who
[1:24:47] are great among us to be
[1:24:50] servants to serve others if you can't
[1:24:53] humble yourself to serve you are not
[1:24:56] called into the ministry Ministry is all
[1:24:59] about
[1:25:00] service Ministry is all about service
[1:25:03] yes sir not Power Glory esteem and you
[1:25:07] know and all those kind of things it's
[1:25:09] all about humility and service you know
[1:25:12] Jesus was the greatest Minister was the
[1:25:14] greatest man that came and lived on
[1:25:16] Earth but do you know what he did he
[1:25:17] washed the disciples feet he washed the
[1:25:19] disciples feet the dirtiest part of the
[1:25:21] body and he said to them even Peter had
[1:25:24] refused he says you can't wash my feet
[1:25:26] he said but if I don't wash your feet
[1:25:27] you are not part of me he says okay wash
[1:25:30] my old body you know friends I want to
[1:25:33] tell you something if you are great you
[1:25:35] will be humble if you want to see Great
[1:25:38] Men you will look at them and see that
[1:25:40] they are humble never mistake someone
[1:25:43] who is humble for being poor and low
[1:25:46] down always great men who know they are
[1:25:48] great will always be humble but when you
[1:25:51] find someone so stiff necked and you
[1:25:53] know
[1:25:55] hey I'm the bishop I'm the man of God I
[1:25:56] am this I'm that you know you will know
[1:25:59] that man is nothing is just an empty tin
[1:26:02] sir but thank God because the message
[1:26:05] has straightened us up it has taken us
[1:26:07] away from those kind of things that I've
[1:26:09] not seen really I've not seen any
[1:26:11] minister in the message who would you
[1:26:13] know brag and make themselves bigger
[1:26:15] than the others no why because the
[1:26:18] message humbles you the message amen
[1:26:20] puts you in your place amen you have to
[1:26:24] understand a servant not a lord over the
[1:26:26] people but a servant over the people we
[1:26:29] are ministers of the
[1:26:31] Gospel Matthew 23:8 says but be not ye
[1:26:36] called Rabbi for one is your master even
[1:26:39] Christ and all ye Brethren and call no
[1:26:41] man your father upon the Earth for one
[1:26:43] is your father which is in heaven praise
[1:26:45] the name of the Lord he's trying to show
[1:26:47] come on be servants be humble be humble
[1:26:52] be humble now in in the message the re
[1:26:55] rejected King which I've been reading
[1:26:56] from it says now Samuel is in our
[1:26:59] message represents the Holy Spirit now
[1:27:01] Samuel was the mouthpiece of God and
[1:27:03] today the holy spirit is the mouthpiece
[1:27:06] of God and today instead of having all
[1:27:10] of our different F go in church God
[1:27:13] wants us to let him
[1:27:15] rule God wants us the Believers to let
[1:27:19] God rule not
[1:27:22] popes Bishops and General
[1:27:25] overseers and doctrines and
[1:27:27] denominations and everything he sent the
[1:27:30] Holy Spirit to rule the
[1:27:33] church
[1:27:35] Hallelujah we believe in the Holy that's
[1:27:37] why if you don't have the Holy Ghost you
[1:27:40] are not being ruled over by God he wants
[1:27:41] to be in your heart and to rule over
[1:27:44] you in the in in the message the Hebrews
[1:27:48] the Hebrews said is chapter 5 and six I
[1:27:51] promise that I would read a lot and I
[1:27:52] want to follow closely because I'm
[1:27:53] building up up to
[1:27:55] something he says but I believe in the
[1:27:57] in the supreme authority of the local
[1:27:59] assembly now having understood friends
[1:28:03] that God is the leader of this church he
[1:28:06] wants to have sovereignty he wants to be
[1:28:08] Lord over our souls he wants to lead us
[1:28:11] he wants to lift up one and bring down
[1:28:13] another and he wants the greatest among
[1:28:16] us to be servants to be humble all right
[1:28:18] but then we understand every local
[1:28:21] assembly every Church local assembly
[1:28:23] starts is is is is Sovereign he says and
[1:28:28] I believe in the supreme authority of
[1:28:29] the local assembly yes Let each Church
[1:28:32] be its own choose its pastors its
[1:28:35] deacons its whatever it is and then that
[1:28:38] way the man in there has no Bishop over
[1:28:42] him the Holy Spirit wants to speak
[1:28:45] something to that
[1:28:46] church they don't have to ask anybody
[1:28:49] about whether they could do this or do
[1:28:51] that it is the individual in with the
[1:28:54] Holy Spirit show me by the Bible what
[1:28:57] what's greater in the Bible than a local
[1:29:00] Elder to a local church he says a local
[1:29:02] Elder in that local church is the
[1:29:04] greater is the greatest office that
[1:29:06] there is that's right yes sir the
[1:29:08] sovereignty of the local church each
[1:29:10] Church in
[1:29:12] itself now Brotherhood that's wonderful
[1:29:15] all churches ought to be in brotherhood
[1:29:17] like that together but the sovereignty
[1:29:19] of the local
[1:29:21] church meaning the local church is
[1:29:24] Sovereign in
[1:29:28] itself let me let me proceed so that I
[1:29:31] can bring it all together in conclusion
[1:29:33] now listen he says now same same message
[1:29:36] now this is part two now if there is
[1:29:39] anything wrong in the church that you
[1:29:40] ever know of some individual or some
[1:29:42] person or anything you are Duty bound
[1:29:44] and you will answer before God if you
[1:29:46] don't clear that thing out you the
[1:29:48] church now remember it's not on my
[1:29:51] shoulders as a pastor it is on yours
[1:29:54] and anything wrong in the church God
[1:29:56] will make you answer for it that's right
[1:29:58] that's the way he runs his church that's
[1:30:01] the way it is in the Bible That's the
[1:30:04] order of the Bible That's the
[1:30:05] sovereignty of the local church the
[1:30:08] pastor he says the pastor is the head
[1:30:11] not General overseer somewhere the
[1:30:12] pastor of that local church is the
[1:30:15] what is the
[1:30:17] head now I want to show you having
[1:30:21] brought up that because you see when we
[1:30:25] talk about
[1:30:27] um uh the when we talk about the local
[1:30:30] church okay maybe before I I get into
[1:30:32] that let's first read from the Ephesian
[1:30:34] Church age um Chapter 3 of the church
[1:30:37] age book Ephesian Church age some of you
[1:30:40] who don't read these messages they they
[1:30:42] really are so nice if you can read them
[1:30:43] you'll grow in the things of God you'll
[1:30:45] grow in the things of God read the
[1:30:47] message yourself so that you don't get
[1:30:49] misled read the Bible read the message
[1:30:52] ah you'll be fine listen now now what
[1:30:54] was the spiritual climate of that church
[1:30:57] it had left its first love leaving its
[1:31:00] first love of the word of God was
[1:31:02] revealed to us as having fallen from its
[1:31:04] origin which was Pentecost in plain
[1:31:07] English that means the this church was
[1:31:10] in danger of being taken away from the
[1:31:14] leading of the Holy Spirit the control
[1:31:16] of the Holy Spirit did you see it's a
[1:31:19] danger the every church every local
[1:31:22] church must always be F by the Holy
[1:31:24] Spirit and the word not by a man or by a
[1:31:27] group of men but by the Holy
[1:31:30] Ghost he says this way this was exactly
[1:31:35] what took place after Moses LED Israel
[1:31:37] out of Egypt the way of God was to lead
[1:31:40] them by The Cloud of fire prophetic
[1:31:43] utterance Miracles and signs and God
[1:31:47] given wonders Oh Glory that's why I love
[1:31:50] this spach things brother I love it
[1:31:54] where the church hasn't these things
[1:31:56] where there is no Supernatural
[1:31:58] manifestation of the Holy Spirit where
[1:32:00] there is no Miracles where there is no
[1:32:02] signs and wonders where there is no
[1:32:04] prophetic utterances where there is no
[1:32:06] you know STS and interpretation brother
[1:32:09] we are risking by being led by
[1:32:12] men we want to be led by the Holy
[1:32:15] [Applause]
[1:32:17] Ghost this was to be accomplished by God
[1:32:21] selected oh hallelujah how was going God
[1:32:24] going to accomplish leading his church
[1:32:27] by the Holy Ghost how how by simply
[1:32:30] coming from heaven like wind no this was
[1:32:32] going to be accomplished by God selected
[1:32:35] God ordained God equipped and God sent
[1:32:40] men you cannot take men out of the
[1:32:43] equation God will always use
[1:32:46] men and if you about to hear from God on
[1:32:49] anything brother you should always
[1:32:51] respect man of God
[1:32:54] amen I tell you what many people fail to
[1:32:59] see the day of their visitation because
[1:33:00] they look at a man they don't see God in
[1:33:03] men they look at a woman they don't see
[1:33:05] God in that woman but you see God uses
[1:33:08] men and women to accomplish what he
[1:33:10] wants to
[1:33:12] accomplish you can't take that out of
[1:33:14] the equation you see what happened to
[1:33:17] these people he says men with a whole
[1:33:21] Camp being dominated by a holy ghost
[1:33:22] move I love that
[1:33:24] okay let's go up a little bit it
[1:33:26] says this was exactly what took place
[1:33:28] after Moses LED Israel out of the way
[1:33:30] God was to lead them was
[1:33:32] to okay all right they rebelled and
[1:33:35] wanted a
[1:33:36] set this was to be accomplished by God
[1:33:38] selected God ordained God equipped and
[1:33:40] God sent men with a whole Camp being
[1:33:44] dominated by a holy ghost move we want
[1:33:47] our church to be under a holy ghost
[1:33:50] move
[1:33:51] Hallelujah woo they re bailed and wanted
[1:33:55] a set of rules and Creeds to go by we
[1:33:58] are not run by a set of Creeds and rules
[1:34:01] no we are run by the Holy
[1:34:04] Ghost they rebelled and they wanted a
[1:34:07] set of rules and Creeds to go by then
[1:34:09] they wanted a
[1:34:10] king then they wanted to be exactly like
[1:34:13] the world and went into a complete
[1:34:15] apostasy and Oblivion that is exactly
[1:34:18] how the first church age started and it
[1:34:20] will be worse it will get worse and
[1:34:23] worse until the holy spirit is
[1:34:25] completely rejected and God Must Destroy
[1:34:28] the people see how it started out in the
[1:34:32] early church it was called Deeds the
[1:34:35] Deeds of the nians then it became a
[1:34:37] Doctrine it became the standard it
[1:34:40] became the unbending way where men are
[1:34:44] simply listening to men and and the
[1:34:47] Creeds and dogmas instead of listening
[1:34:48] to the Holy Spirit and the word I
[1:34:51] continue here it finally took over and
[1:34:53] God was pushed aside Brothers may we
[1:34:56] never push God aside it started so small
[1:35:00] so quietly so in
[1:35:04] offensively
[1:35:05] H and God was pushed
[1:35:08] aside it looked so good it seemed so
[1:35:11] sound then it caught a hold and like a
[1:35:15] Pyon it squeezed out the very breath and
[1:35:19] killed all the spirituality there was in
[1:35:22] the church oh oh that false Vine is
[1:35:25] subtle it is like an angel of Light
[1:35:29] until it gets a hold on you now I want
[1:35:31] to say that I believe in leadership
[1:35:33] everybody tell your neighbor I believe
[1:35:35] in
[1:35:36] leadership but he says it is not the
[1:35:39] leadership of men I believe
[1:35:42] in I believe in the leadership of the
[1:35:45] Holy Ghost coming through the
[1:35:47] word
[1:35:49] hallelujah and then he says now get
[1:35:53] ready for this and then he says I
[1:35:54] believe also that God has sent men in
[1:35:59] the church tell your neighbor God has
[1:36:01] sent men in the
[1:36:03] church men who are gifted by the
[1:36:07] spirit and they will keep the church in
[1:36:11] order I believe that I believe also that
[1:36:15] the church is ruled over by men let me
[1:36:18] first stop there did you hear that what
[1:36:22] did you hear the church is ruled over by
[1:36:25] what by Men first stop there and think
[1:36:29] about it the church is ruled over by men
[1:36:32] you don't want to believe it you better
[1:36:33] shout Amen on that as
[1:36:35] well God has amen the church is ruled
[1:36:38] over by men that God sends to take
[1:36:43] charge woo the church in the beginning
[1:36:46] was being ruled over by Samuel he was a
[1:36:49] man God had sent to take
[1:36:51] church God uses men
[1:36:54] he says I believe
[1:36:56] that but that rule
[1:37:00] hey this is what changed the order now
[1:37:02] this is only the where the difference is
[1:37:05] the difference is here listen he says he
[1:37:07] says the church is ruled by what by men
[1:37:09] that God has done what sent to take
[1:37:11] charge but he says but that rule is by
[1:37:14] what by the
[1:37:16] word so that it is not man rule really
[1:37:19] ruling but the spirit of
[1:37:22] God for the word and the spirit are
[1:37:26] one Oh Glory not you just telling us oh
[1:37:30] I'm feeling I'm feeling I hear I hear no
[1:37:33] tell us what does the word say if what
[1:37:36] you're feeling or what you hearing or
[1:37:38] the voices you are hearing all the words
[1:37:40] you're hearing are against the word we
[1:37:42] don't want to
[1:37:45] know tell us what the word says and we
[1:37:48] shall believe you to be a man of
[1:37:50] God hallelujah amen
[1:37:56] hallelujah praise God that's why you
[1:37:59] will see a man standing on the pulpit
[1:38:02] and telling their people don't go to
[1:38:04] meetings don't go to that convention it
[1:38:07] is evil don't do
[1:38:08] that if I came here on the pulpit and
[1:38:11] said that you will surely not even hear
[1:38:12] what I said you'll behave as if you
[1:38:14] never heard why because in the message
[1:38:16] we know better we don't we are not led
[1:38:19] by a man we are led by a what we are led
[1:38:22] by a man who God has sent to take charge
[1:38:25] and that man will not rule really by his
[1:38:27] thought but he will rule by the
[1:38:30] word if I have a scripture for what I'm
[1:38:32] saying you better hear it because then
[1:38:33] is the word of
[1:38:36] God Hebrews 13:7 remember where them
[1:38:40] which have the rule over you who have
[1:38:42] spoken unto you the word of God whose
[1:38:45] Faith follow considering the end of
[1:38:47] their conversation now you understand
[1:38:49] there are people that God has sent in
[1:38:51] the church to rule over you
[1:38:54] and those are the pastors the Bishops
[1:38:57] the the the apostles the the you know
[1:39:00] listen but they Ru by the word okay they
[1:39:03] rule by the word so you find now a
[1:39:06] church every church is Sovereign every
[1:39:08] church is Sovereign every chch is is
[1:39:10] independent it doesn't have a bishop
[1:39:12] somewhere but you
[1:39:14] see there is some message which has
[1:39:17] confused some of our
[1:39:19] people brother bam preached it in 1962
[1:39:22] called sides with Jesus and some of the
[1:39:25] unlearned are
[1:39:26] confused and maybe some of them are
[1:39:28] watching me now
[1:39:30] online cuz I sent this message to some
[1:39:33] of them I said watch it you see they
[1:39:35] confused they think oh because we are
[1:39:37] led by the Holy Spirit we are led by we
[1:39:40] should we should we don't have the order
[1:39:43] in the church butam says we are not an
[1:39:45] organization but that doesn't mean we
[1:39:47] are
[1:39:48] disorganized you see we are not a
[1:39:50] denomination but we are organized in how
[1:39:53] we are doing things he says the highest
[1:39:55] office in the local church is an elder
[1:39:57] is the pastor no man over him but you
[1:40:00] see if this church days of the voice as
[1:40:02] we call it dvf if we started different
[1:40:06] fellowships out of our church which
[1:40:09] church is it
[1:40:11] from it is from dvf and therefore it's a
[1:40:14] part of the church it's part of the
[1:40:16] local Fellowship it's part of the local
[1:40:19] church and therefore it's a part of us
[1:40:23] and and that's the whole idea that B bam
[1:40:25] was speaking of in taking sides with
[1:40:28] Jesus he was not bringing the
[1:40:30] denominational idea of Bishops but he
[1:40:33] was bringing he was saying still the
[1:40:35] same thing where now the church has
[1:40:40] prospered and out of the church other
[1:40:42] fellowships have started these ones
[1:40:45] don't run and brother just goes there
[1:40:47] and says now me I'm a bishop of my own
[1:40:49] no it doesn't work that way and then you
[1:40:52] find brother en going in saying no me
[1:40:54] I'm Sovereign I'm Sovereign you just
[1:40:56] beginning you are from us you are our
[1:40:59] child we need to take care of
[1:41:01] you we are your Bishop I'm still your
[1:41:04] Bishop if I'm your Bishop here even if
[1:41:06] you go I'm still your bishop and that
[1:41:08] means Pastor it doesn't mean anything
[1:41:10] better praise the name of the Lord and
[1:41:13] this is what brother bam was speaking of
[1:41:14] in the message taking s to Jesus and I
[1:41:16] wanted to Cle to listen to it carefully
[1:41:19] and understand now I noticed that that
[1:41:23] how the churches the evangelism started
[1:41:25] scattering out everywhere from the
[1:41:27] church they they started scattering out
[1:41:30] from everywhere and when we we will take
[1:41:33] for instance the Paul becoming a great
[1:41:35] missionary to our people we find out
[1:41:37] that he went about wherever the Lord led
[1:41:40] him and he established a church and it
[1:41:42] was a new Faith the churches of those
[1:41:44] days like Asia Minor and all through
[1:41:45] Europe they didn't believe that message
[1:41:48] and when he had to preach the message
[1:41:49] and many was converted to it then there
[1:41:52] was he he if excuse me if he left the
[1:41:55] people in that condition they would
[1:41:57] wander right back into their pagan gods
[1:42:00] and into Judaism and whatever more
[1:42:02] because the people had no one to teach
[1:42:04] them the converts they had no place to
[1:42:07] go so Paul established churches in
[1:42:09] different parts of the
[1:42:12] country and then here he says each one
[1:42:14] of these churches he left someone who
[1:42:17] was in
[1:42:19] order a man that was trustworthy a man
[1:42:22] that was known as a pastor Shepherd like
[1:42:25] myself we we started the fellowship in
[1:42:26] Ethiopia in Adisa we left there a
[1:42:29] brother who is trustworthy a brother who
[1:42:31] is known as a
[1:42:34] pastor oh then after this church then
[1:42:36] become other little churches come out of
[1:42:39] it now when that church other little
[1:42:41] churches come out of what like here in
[1:42:43] dvf after we start you know start out
[1:42:45] and we begin doing evangelism and other
[1:42:47] churches begin coming out you find
[1:42:49] churches starting here churches starting
[1:42:51] there out of this what
[1:42:55] Fellowship okay are you
[1:42:57] following other little churches come out
[1:42:59] of it younger men and old men raised up
[1:43:02] and become churches okay they also
[1:43:04] become churches out of that the man that
[1:43:07] was over the first church was called the
[1:43:11] bishop are you following me now and then
[1:43:15] his that went out from him his children
[1:43:17] was called Shepherds or
[1:43:20] pastors and then each group of little
[1:43:23] churches all would come back to this
[1:43:26] bishop now people have heard this and
[1:43:28] I'm sure some of them wanted to delete
[1:43:29] this from the message it is there
[1:43:30] because it is the word of God praise the
[1:43:33] name of the Lord it is the order of of
[1:43:36] how the churches grow but you see why
[1:43:38] many people in the message have a
[1:43:39] problem with understanding this is
[1:43:41] because many message churches don't
[1:43:44] grow they remain very
[1:43:46] small 50 people in 10 in 20 years they
[1:43:51] don't even they have never heard about
[1:43:53] um maybe another church starting out
[1:43:55] from among
[1:43:56] them and so when another so when some
[1:44:00] Ministries have fellowships which grow
[1:44:03] and they bath other churches and these
[1:44:05] ones become their um sister churches and
[1:44:09] then this pastor here of thew of the
[1:44:12] original Church who brother bam is
[1:44:15] saying is the bishop the pastor the
[1:44:16] Elder the Elder really Bishop means
[1:44:18] Elder as I was starting in the beginning
[1:44:20] are you following me so uh you know the
[1:44:23] Elder who is the bishop now he is um he
[1:44:28] he has these other pastors in all these
[1:44:30] little fellowships and he says they all
[1:44:32] come back to him come back to him for
[1:44:33] what we shall see it after I'm going to
[1:44:35] to read for you come back for what come
[1:44:37] back for teaching come back for
[1:44:38] grounding come back for establishing in
[1:44:41] the knowledge of the truth not
[1:44:42] controlling around and leading like
[1:44:43] sheep are you following me but they have
[1:44:47] to come back they have to recognize that
[1:44:48] Elder but you see in the message we are
[1:44:50] not used to that maybe we used the Which
[1:44:53] churches begin we used to Breaking
[1:44:54] churches you see this one I feel a
[1:44:57] calling upon my life and then it begins
[1:44:59] brother brother R join me I'm going to
[1:45:01] start a church sister I'm going to
[1:45:03] brother I please just join me you would
[1:45:05] see I even make you the Deon brother and
[1:45:08] then they break the church and then they
[1:45:10] start another church there and and I'm
[1:45:12] Sovereign don't talk to me that is not
[1:45:14] the way brother bam told us that is not
[1:45:17] right and I thank God that this church
[1:45:20] did not start by breaking any church we
[1:45:22] started organically I love that word
[1:45:24] organically we started organically we
[1:45:25] started from the house here we went
[1:45:27] there became bigger got a tent and then
[1:45:29] until we came we came here and of course
[1:45:31] a ministry will attract different people
[1:45:33] coming from anywhere I I love the
[1:45:35] message because brother bam has
[1:45:37] presented it in such a way that it
[1:45:38] leaves no room for speculation or for
[1:45:40] debate but the BAM said any man has a
[1:45:43] right to choose a fellowship where they
[1:45:44] want to Fellowship in so you see it
[1:45:47] might be from one church or from the
[1:45:49] other church I don't care here we have
[1:45:50] people who have believed from here we
[1:45:52] have those who have joined from other
[1:45:53] churches but that's okay that's all okay
[1:45:55] it's all in the plan of God it's all in
[1:45:57] the word of God there's Provisions for
[1:45:59] that you see but you see once you come
[1:46:01] and be a part of that fellowship and you
[1:46:03] be you know then how does another church
[1:46:06] start it starts if you want to it start
[1:46:08] organically then God sends a man or if
[1:46:11] the church itself has a program like I
[1:46:13] know some Churches have programs and
[1:46:15] then maybe God do some evangelism
[1:46:17] somewhere a church begins there then the
[1:46:19] church our church our fellowship
[1:46:21] original Fellowship will look after that
[1:46:23] Fellowship for a while a while could be
[1:46:26] 5 years 10 years for until God sends a
[1:46:28] man there now you remember when I was
[1:46:31] beginning to read by bam said the church
[1:46:33] has his Sovereign in itself it chooses
[1:46:36] its own leaders you remember that not
[1:46:38] he's not talking about the original
[1:46:40] Church where there was a man with a
[1:46:41] vision to start he's talking about a
[1:46:43] church like that for example we go
[1:46:47] brother brother Deon en we go in ch
[1:46:51] there oh there in kasak whatever and
[1:46:53] then we we we do a
[1:46:56] crusade um you invite some of your
[1:46:58] friends and others come and then a
[1:46:59] church starts a church of maybe 50
[1:47:02] people or 20 people or 30 or 50 and then
[1:47:04] we have a fellowship there running
[1:47:06] running running over time we are not
[1:47:07] going to say oh because the brother is
[1:47:08] near let him start no it doesn't work
[1:47:10] that way the church has to First grow
[1:47:13] the people have to understand the
[1:47:14] message know the message who is going to
[1:47:16] be helping them the original church is
[1:47:18] going to be sending ministers to help
[1:47:20] them and then after this church or
[1:47:22] Fellowship has grown to such an extent
[1:47:24] that it can
[1:47:25] now within among themselves choose one
[1:47:28] man to lead it's not me to say now
[1:47:31] brother I see the way I see you now I've
[1:47:32] given you that one now you I've sent you
[1:47:35] there HH we don't operate that way in
[1:47:37] the message you see you see the church
[1:47:40] itself that local church that local body
[1:47:42] of Believers there will now me as the
[1:47:45] Elder can maybe just go there to help
[1:47:47] them vote among themselves maybe suggest
[1:47:50] some names and then they vote among
[1:47:52] themselves a man that would lead the
[1:47:53] assembly after they have voted who voted
[1:47:56] for that man the people so I have no
[1:48:00] control over that man because the people
[1:48:02] are the ones who put him in that
[1:48:04] position praise the name of the Lord and
[1:48:07] so does the does it eliminate the the
[1:48:11] elders responsibility no does it
[1:48:13] eliminate the sovereignty of the local
[1:48:15] church no so you see it's an it's a
[1:48:17] misunderstanding we have in our
[1:48:20] generation and now I'll just continue
[1:48:22] here reading in this message taking
[1:48:24] Jesus maybe a little bit of uh quotes
[1:48:26] here and then I I'll close shortly
[1:48:28] listen he says then I would say each one
[1:48:30] of these men he out here now brother bam
[1:48:31] is going to begin calling out men that
[1:48:33] have started believing the message out
[1:48:35] from his church from his Fellowship
[1:48:39] where he was a pastor he says these men
[1:48:42] like brother CRA and brother Junior all
[1:48:44] of them as long as they feel their duty
[1:48:46] at that post and they Associated here
[1:48:49] together you can't go down and meet with
[1:48:51] Methodist you have no fellowship with
[1:48:53] them the Baptists no you go talking
[1:48:56] about speaking in tongues and the
[1:48:57] baptism in Jesus name they kick you out
[1:48:59] that quick you see that's right you sit
[1:49:02] around there you would be like a dove
[1:49:03] Among Us a bunch of crow crows you would
[1:49:06] have no fellowship at all you would die
[1:49:08] I ain't making fun of Methodist and
[1:49:10] Baptist now remember that I am not
[1:49:12] saying that I'm just drawing a
[1:49:14] comparison there are many Methodist and
[1:49:17] Baptist are good man godly man but I'm
[1:49:19] talking about the fellowship so he says
[1:49:21] you can't fellowship with someone and
[1:49:22] unless you believe what they believe you
[1:49:25] can't now go and team up with
[1:49:27] Pentecostals Baptists and and some
[1:49:29] Methodist and say us begin a fellowship
[1:49:31] Fellowship on on the basis of what you
[1:49:34] see there is brother he says there okay

[1:50:55] here is where my Ministry started from
[1:50:57] but a quarter of ministers in the
[1:50:59] message will be able to know who their
[1:51:01] fathers are in the
[1:51:02] Lord if you ask them many of them who is
[1:51:05] your father in the Lord they would don't

[1:52:34] got my kingdom we are not raising
[1:52:35] kingdoms we are raising the kingdom of
[1:52:38] God praise the name of the Lord now I'm
[1:52:41] a pastor of my own I don't even need to
[1:52:42] look up who who who right now recently I
[1:52:47] was talking to uh a brother one of my
[1:52:50] sons in the Lord I don't know if that's
[1:52:52] the word to say in Ethiopia he's a
[1:52:54] pastor many of you know him brother
[1:52:55] Ephraim so he's doing a great great work
[1:52:58] in one of the regions in Ethiopia so he
[1:53:01] um several especially this past several
[1:53:04] weeks a few men of God have been
[1:53:07] contacting me these are Bishops now if
[1:53:09] he's a bishop you understand what it
[1:53:10] means he's a man of a great big group
[1:53:13] and you know he served God for a long
[1:53:15] long time and so um they've been
[1:53:17] contacting me some of them he has
[1:53:18] baptized so far two Bishops in the
[1:53:20] denominational world and one of them was
[1:53:22] in Russia and he contacted me he said
[1:53:24] I'm I'm in Russia do we have Believers
[1:53:26] here he said my name is so and so H uh
[1:53:29] he said Apostle ephra has contacted me
[1:53:31] with you he said you are his Pastor you
[1:53:33] know because you see brother Ephraim is
[1:53:35] calling him an apostle but you see he's
[1:53:37] been taught well he understands look as
[1:53:39] much as this man is looking at me as his
[1:53:42] Apostle I've presented a message to him
[1:53:45] but I also have to connect him with my
[1:53:47] pastor so he can know more of the
[1:53:49] message and this man is is in Russia I
[1:53:52] told him oh you're in Russia I called I
[1:53:54] called up the brother the pastor is a
[1:53:55] pastor in Russia his name is um uh uh I
[1:54:00] don't I don't remember the name I'm
[1:54:01] sorry but you see um he had um uh I met
[1:54:05] him I met him when I was in um Germany
[1:54:07] so he's a very good brother powerful
[1:54:09] testimony and so they're doing a great
[1:54:11] work in Russia so I connected him over
[1:54:13] with him and probably they will be able
[1:54:14] to meet and I've never met the man
[1:54:16] myself but you see he wrote me a message
[1:54:18] he says I desire to meet you I desire to
[1:54:20] meet you so you see this this is how God
[1:54:23] works he says you see um get training in
[1:54:25] your own groups and other ministers men
[1:54:27] that you see has ACC calling in their
[1:54:28] life for the ministry train them youngen
[1:54:30] bring them in here to the Elder all of
[1:54:33] you sit together in a ministerial
[1:54:34] meeting and there teach the deeper
[1:54:36] things of God don't go on to the bad end
[1:54:38] keep someone who can have confidence in
[1:54:41] to be kind of a leader a leader for you
[1:54:44] so we must always have leaders we are
[1:54:47] not leaderless we may not be a
[1:54:49] denomination but we are not
[1:54:51] leaderless Hal hallelujah praise the
[1:54:54] name of the Lord and then sometimes if
[1:54:56] you don't see it just exactly the way he
[1:54:58] does goes the goes that's all right you
[1:55:02] in the faith anyhow just move along
[1:55:04] maybe when he come together then all of
[1:55:06] us together we pray the designment of
[1:55:09] God come down and he will give it just
[1:55:12] exactly what it is you see and let us
[1:55:14] know just how to do yet and it says and
[1:55:18] in there churches can go here and
[1:55:20] training up a group of men and if I'm an
[1:55:23] Evangelistic if I'm in Evangelistic work
[1:55:25] somewhere there is places I can place
[1:55:27] them worldwide brother bam now here is a
[1:55:30] prophet is saying I have places
[1:55:31] worldwide I can send those men if you
[1:55:33] give it to me I can always send them go
[1:55:35] here go there go there go there go there
[1:55:37] like I sent this brother over to a
[1:55:38] brother in Russia said go meet him you
[1:55:40] see so this is how God works Jesus
[1:55:43] Christ is the bishop of our souls but
[1:55:45] then you see he has men that he uses
[1:55:48] Among Us and he uses them for what if
[1:55:51] you remember in the book of Ephesian 4
[1:55:52] he says what what what is the fivefold
[1:55:54] ministry for I think we can finish with
[1:55:57] that read Ephesians chapter
[1:56:03] 4 it says for the perfecting of the
[1:56:06] Saints for the work of the ministry vers
[1:56:08] 12 for the edifying of the body of
[1:56:10] Christ till we all come in the unity of
[1:56:14] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[1:56:16] Son of God andto the perfect man andto
[1:56:18] the measure of the stat of the fullness
[1:56:20] of Christ praise the name of the Lord
[1:56:22] amen and so this last beat in the
[1:56:25] message teing heads with Jesus I've not
[1:56:26] read it for us because we've not grown
[1:56:29] to that level yet I've really read it
[1:56:31] for the other people who had questions
[1:56:33] and um but of course it's also good for
[1:56:35] our understanding and to know how the
[1:56:37] order of the church is and um this um
[1:56:41] you find that churches especially in um
[1:56:43] Congo in sorry in Zimbabwe they have
[1:56:46] been well out and you find the churches
[1:56:48] are in order they they understand how
[1:56:51] things move they they will always honor
[1:56:53] the elders they will always you know
[1:56:55] submit to the elders even when the Elder
[1:56:57] makes a mistake you won't find one
[1:56:58] Minister you know pointing out imagine
[1:57:01] me standing here on the pulpit and
[1:57:03] calling out a minister and rebuking him
[1:57:05] openly and even calling out his name it
[1:57:08] is ridiculous you see what Young
[1:57:10] ministers can do but we thank God that
[1:57:12] he has given us councel from the message
[1:57:13] of the hour and that we stand we stand
[1:57:16] on because it's the food for our souls
[1:57:18] you may stand on your feet God bless you
[1:57:26] praise the
[1:57:27] Lord how many love the message of the
[1:57:30] hour amen amen we thank God for the
[1:57:33] message because by that we live by that
[1:57:36] we know who we are amen and by that we
[1:57:39] can grow and can edify Our Generation
[1:57:42] friends there's a lot that we need to do
[1:57:43] before we go in prayer I just wanted to
[1:57:45] let you know uh of um the vision that
