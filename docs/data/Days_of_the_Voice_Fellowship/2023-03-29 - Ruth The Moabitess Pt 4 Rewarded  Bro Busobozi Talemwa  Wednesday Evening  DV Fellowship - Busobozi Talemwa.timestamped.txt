[28:38] together is
[28:43] and when she came to her mother in law
[28:46] she said who at thou my daughter and she
[28:48] told her all that the man had done to
[28:51] her and she said these six measures of
[28:53] Bali gave him me for he said to me go
[28:55] not empty unto thy mother-in-law then
[28:58] said she sit still my daughter until now
[29:02] know how the matter will fall for the
[29:04] man will not be in rest until he have
[29:06] finished the thing this day
[29:26] [Music]
[30:07] foreign
[30:10] are you happy to be in the house of the
[30:12] Lord this evening
[30:15] so we are speaking on Ruth getting
[30:18] rewarded
[30:21] I was thinking that the Book of Ruth is
[30:25] a very uh good book for believers to
[30:30] study because it actually has the whole
[30:32] Bible
[30:39] I'm just you know through these Services
[30:42] I'm just touching a few bits and pieces
[30:47] if I was attacked by vas we can actually
[30:50] start the whole Bible out of the Book of
[30:52] Ruth
[30:55] [Music]
[30:57] so I can decide that we take the Book of
[30:59] Ruth for an entire year having Services
[31:02] twice a year a week
[31:06] to my records because as I was studying
[31:10] it you you kind of feel that you are
[31:11] getting almost to every part every
[31:14] Doctrine every part in the in the
[31:16] scriptures
[31:58] [Music]
[32:05] you will find out that Ruth was not just
[32:08] the more about us
[32:11] but Ruth was more than that
[32:15] she was she came it appears as if where
[32:19] she came somebody was already waiting
[32:21] for her because
[32:25] she wasn't a strange person coming into
[32:27] a Strange Land
[32:29] again she was a person that was coming
[32:33] back into a place where she was supposed
[32:35] to be foreign
[33:35] [Music]
[33:59] why we have some people who don't
[34:02] believe in Jesus Christ is
[34:05] because they think they can't understand
[34:10] the force that brought them into this
[34:12] world
[34:14] I think I was speaking to one young man
[34:16] a few days ago
[34:43] [Applause]
[35:15] amen amen that's why the Bible says that
[35:19] in deep Sleep
[35:21] When when sleep falleth on man one man
[35:24] is in deep Sleep
[35:26] God brings him Vision
[35:29] God brings them dreams
[35:32] believe us dream and have visions in the
[35:35] night
[35:37] let me tell you we dream and see things
[35:40] of the future
[35:42] I don't know whether it has ever
[35:45] happened to you
[35:46] whereby you find yourself in a place
[35:50] and you see as if you had been there
[35:52] before
[36:04] we are in the past
[36:06] God has made for his own
[36:10] and let me tell you we might not realize
[36:13] who we are
[36:14] today but the more we hear the word
[36:17] serious
[37:17] finish the thing this day
[37:19] and I say our Jesus our borrowers could
[37:22] not rest until he had finished it at the
[37:24] cross yes you are February
[37:28] and I want to say remember how he grown
[37:32] remember how he cried even blood the
[37:36] whole night
[37:38] remember how he was under pressure and
[37:40] Restless
[37:43] when he went to the Cross he said it is
[37:46] finished
[37:48] Jesus could not rest until he was on the
[37:51] cross to finish it yesterday
[37:54] what was he going to finish he was going
[37:57] to conclude the Redemption process
[38:02] all the deciding
[38:05] queries
[38:11] Ruth went through time of decision
[39:03] Jesus Christ by living the life of a
[39:07] Believer or of a Christian two words
[39:16] receiving the Holy Ghost and then he
[39:19] leaves his life through us our yes
[39:23] for all this let me know your name is
[39:26] nothing without the Rapture
[39:29] that is the reward coming friends
[39:51] praise the name of the Lord and I want
[39:54] us to see now after that little Preamble
[39:57] I want us to go through now the book of
[39:59] chapter Ruth chapter four
[40:05] and since on Wednesday I usually want to
[40:08] do one hour so I want us to uh you know
[40:11] stick our minds together and put
[40:13] everything aside and let us delve right
[40:15] into this
[40:16] foreign
[40:22] [Music]
[40:33] I might have started this I might have
[40:35] waited upon the Lord I might have little
[40:37] Inspirations for you but you have to
[40:39] receive it in order for the Lord to use
[40:40] me for you
[40:41] um
[40:47] just put everything aside and let your
[40:49] minds be here just you know respond to
[40:52] the word and let God speaks
[40:58] verse 1 then went for us up to the gate
[41:01] we shall first read up to verses 9 and
[41:04] then we We Carry On from there and we'll
[41:06] read the rest of the portions as we go
[41:07] on then when was up to the gate so we're
[41:10] not going to interpret it just listen
[41:12] and read through your Bible as well
[41:15] then went for us up to the gate and sat
[41:18] him down there and before the king's man
[41:20] of wumba was spec came by unto whom he
[41:24] said ho such a one turn aside sit down
[41:28] here and it understood and sat down and
[41:30] he took 10 men of the Elders of the city
[41:32] and said great City down here and they
[41:35] sat down and he said unto the Kinsmen
[41:37] Naomi and he said unto the king's man
[41:39] Naomi that has come again out of the
[41:42] country of Moab seleth Apostle of land
[41:44] which was our brother El merichis and I
[41:47] thought to advertise thee
[41:49] saying buy it before the inhabitants and
[41:52] before the Elders of my people if thou
[41:55] will redeem it redeem it but if thou
[41:57] will not redeem it then tell me that I
[41:59] may know for there is none to redeem it
[42:01] beside thee and I am after thee and he
[42:04] said I will redeem it then Boaz then
[42:07] said was what day thou bias the field of
[42:10] the hand of Naomi thou must buy it also
[42:13] of Ruth the moabitus the wife of the
[42:16] Dead to raise up the name of the Dead
[42:18] upon his inheritance
[42:20] and the King's man say they cannot
[42:22] redeem it for myself lest I MA my own
[42:25] inheritance redeem thou my right to
[42:28] thyself for I cannot redeem it now this
[42:31] was the manner in in former time in
[42:33] Israel concerning redeeming and
[42:34] concerning changing for to confirm all
[42:37] things a man plucked off his shoe and
[42:40] gave it to his neighbor and this was a
[42:42] testimony in Israel therefore the king's
[42:44] man said unto the world buy it for thee
[42:47] so he drew off his shoe and Bawa said
[42:50] unto the elders and unto all the people
[42:52] you are witnesses this day that I have
[42:55] both all that was early marriages and
[42:57] all that was Chileans and macarons of
[43:00] the hand of Naomi
[43:03] now
[43:05] as you remember when Ruth was resting at
[43:08] the feet of boas
[43:12] told her
[43:14] but you see there is another one
[43:18] and closer Kinsmen
[43:22] who can redeem
[43:25] and redeem all that was early marriage
[43:28] but as for me yes I'm in the lineage of
[43:32] redemption
[43:34] but I am not the very one supposed to
[43:36] redeem
[43:38] there is another one and so now but
[43:42] what's called a meeting
[43:44] and he brought he brought this man
[43:48] at the gate and he told him
[43:54] that is
[44:00] a wife of our brother
[44:02] and she has a pastor of land foreign

[47:28] Hallelujah man let me tell you Jesus
[47:31] Christ yes Christmas of the root of
[47:34] David
[47:35] and as you will see here
[47:38] in the Book of Rules this is where David
[47:41] comes from
[47:43] this is where you know you know this
[47:46] lineage of Ruth
[47:48] as we shall see here by the end of the
[47:50] services
[48:26] to be able to die on the cross
[48:29] because the Bible says
[48:34] there is
[48:54] Uganda foreign
[49:54] himself
[50:54] foreign
[51:14] exactly and he would remove issue
[51:18] and put it up as a sign now
[51:24] I'm redeeming
[51:26] all of you see me I'm ready
[51:29] that's what Jesus did that's what God
[51:33] did the Bible says in the book of
[51:37] Philippians chapter 2 so we create this
[51:40] mind be in here
[51:44] being in the form of God
[51:47] he was taught himself
[51:52] because he found himself in a fashion as
[51:55] a man yes
[52:01] so that he even died on the death of the

[57:47] the Lord make the woman that has come
[57:49] into the house like Richard like Leah
[57:52] which too did build the house of Israel
[57:54] and do thou worthily in Ephrata and be
[57:57] famous in Bethlehem
[57:59] and let the house be like the house of
[58:02] fairies whom Tamar bear unto Judah of
[58:06] the seed which the Lord shall give thee
[58:08] of this young woman
[58:10] so bawas took Ruth and she was his wife
[58:13] and when he went in unto her the lord
[58:15] gave her conception and she bear a son
[58:18] now listen to this and the women said
[58:20] unto Naomi blessed be the Lord which has
[58:22] not left thee this day without a king's
[58:25] man that his name may be famous in
[58:28] Israel and it shall be unto thee a

[58:45] woman
[58:46] her neighbors give each a name
[58:50] saying there is a sun born to Naomi and
[58:53] they called his name Obed he is the
[58:56] father of Jesse the father of David amen
[59:02] this is the line where Jesus came from
[59:07] our own Lord Jesus did the Bible say he
[59:11] would be the root of David Bible
[59:16] and here rules
[59:23] gave birth to a son or a bit
[59:27] um
[59:30] and yes I get back to David yes and the
[59:34] Bible said that David would have an
[59:37] everlasting Kingdom
[59:40] even when Jesus Christ comes in the
[59:43] Millennium foreign
[1:00:02] Hallelujah
[1:01:02] Hallelujah
[1:01:21] [Applause]
[1:01:25] we call it the Throne of David
[1:01:27] but guess what right there when he's
[1:01:30] ruling other kingdoms
[1:01:32] we fit the bride will be right by
[1:01:36] history
[1:01:40] oh my this is amazing
[1:01:44] praise the name of the Lord we are going
[1:01:46] to read Psalm from the Revelation
[1:01:47] chapter 5.
[1:01:52] from the message
[1:02:00] in the year 61 it says Ruth Ruth making
[1:02:04] her decision
[1:02:05] many times of course you know I read
[1:02:07] without quoting at all
[1:02:10] I really preach without quoting them
[1:02:14] but on some messages I really feel like
[1:02:16] I should tell you what the prophet says
[1:02:18] directly
[1:02:21] and this is one of it so follow me here
[1:02:24] it says Ruth Lucy making her decision a
[1:02:28] type of the church a gentle Church she
[1:02:31] decided
[1:02:33] crossed over into the land
[1:02:35] now a lot of times we methodists
[1:02:39] uh Baptists we think that's all you have
[1:02:42] to do
[1:02:43] a message
[1:02:46] she had just got started
[1:02:48] she hadn't got nowhere yet
[1:02:51] she just got over into the line
[1:02:54] now the next thing she had to do
[1:02:57] she had to work she becomes a legalist
[1:03:02] she had to work out her own salvation
[1:03:06] with fear and Temperance
[1:03:11] when you become a Christian the first
[1:03:13] time
[1:03:17] you even feel like oh this is so hard
[1:03:23] this is so bad
[1:03:27] why is it so difficult why is it so hard
[1:03:32] because you've not got to the place of
[1:03:34] resting foreign
[1:03:39] looks like a whole thing of legalism
[1:03:45] and you see Ruth had to walk
[1:03:48] out her salvation with fears
[1:03:53] the methodists and the Baptists arrived
[1:03:56] at and stopped it's never Baptist
[1:03:59] because the methodists and the Baptists
[1:04:01] really their religion is all about works
[1:04:07] really really that's much but you see we
[1:04:10] have to go on
[1:04:12] we think that's all you have to do
[1:04:16] but you see she become a legalist
[1:04:21] she went out into the field and put her
[1:04:24] clothes upon her again
[1:04:26] and went out into the field and green
[1:04:29] behind the maidens in order to get
[1:04:31] sustaining food for the day again
[1:04:35] what was she doing she was trying to
[1:04:38] find amen
[1:04:56] [Applause]
[1:05:39] to the point of working together you
[1:05:42] collects and everything
[1:05:43] we have to leave that on God
[1:05:46] bless the place of Grace
[1:05:49] we are just resting at his feet
[1:05:56] and we are doing everything he's telling
[1:05:59] us
[1:06:04] the point of receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:06:07] and the Holy Ghost is not the end
[1:06:13] the holy spirit is the honest
[1:06:23] you're the only payment
[1:06:26] yes still that's not the end game
[1:06:30] some Believers I think when you decide
[1:06:33] to follow Jesus yes
[1:06:35] [Music]
[1:06:38] that's just the beginning
[1:06:41] there are many people who get baptized
[1:06:43] and will go to hell yeah
[1:06:50] that's the truth
[1:06:52] is
[1:06:59] baptism does not take you to heaven
[1:07:02] and yet you must do it you must make the
[1:07:07] decision
[1:07:08] you must do the works
[1:07:11] but the works will not make it for you
[1:07:15] it's not because you did this
[1:07:19] but because you dressed a certain way
[1:07:27] or you cut your hair
[1:07:30] grow up
[1:07:32] because you need to use
[1:07:37] makeup Oh Heaven is sure
[1:07:42] that's not all of it wax is a must for a
[1:07:46] Believer
[1:07:47] um
[1:08:08] you are foreign
[1:08:27] [Applause]
[1:08:50] alone doesn't take it to the Rapture
[1:08:53] Hallelujah as the bride of Christ
[1:08:59] to the stage of resting
[1:09:04] the moment you receive the holy ghosts
[1:09:10] you don't care about nothing
[1:09:15] it is
[1:09:18] nothing is hard for you anymore
[1:09:24] you heard the wrong things
[1:09:39] and then God gives you that as the
[1:09:43] honest
[1:09:44] of your salvation
[1:09:48] you have not arrived foreign
[1:10:02] ah
[1:10:03] am I preaching to someone
