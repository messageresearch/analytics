[16:27] buildings
[16:30] we are going to be looking for a lot of
[16:32] money
[16:33] together
[16:37] because initially we thought the
[16:39] meetings will not be camped but
[16:42] looks like a lot of plan to come
[16:45] on
[16:54] ah yeah I mean that number
[16:57] are you in that number
[17:02] are you that number
[17:05] [Music]

[17:59] [Music]
[18:03] we thank the Lord for this wonderful
[18:04] opportunity given to me
[18:07] 2023
[18:09] amen
[18:11] I think is
[18:13] it's going to be one of my prefest
[18:15] sermon
[18:21] yeah but I first of all I want to thank
[18:24] you all Brethren is
[18:28] for supporting days of the voice
[18:30] Ministry
[18:35] yeah I really always do appreciate your
[18:37] presence
[18:40] the way you support the world
[18:46] your finances
[18:51] and with your prayers
[18:54] be to God
[18:56] and it's my heart desire and prayer
[19:03] let us keep the fire burning
[19:07] and let us never settle for less
[19:11] every time we look at every time you
[19:13] read the word
[19:15] don't just stop there reading the verses
[19:18] the chapters and you count I've read ten
[19:21] books docomo
[19:23] [Music]
[19:43] [Music]
[19:53] just for just like a minute we read the
[19:56] you know you go in the Book of Joshua
[19:57] chapter one
[20:05] amen Amina
[20:12] Joshua chapter one yes
[20:16] if you're there you can read for us
[20:22] yes
[20:28] then we shall continue
[20:30] yes
[21:10] [Music]
[21:25] in Jesus we have prayed amen blessed in
[21:29] the name of the Lord
[21:34] I thank God
[21:36] for all of you
[21:38] the
[21:41] youth and the adults
[21:43] it uh
[21:47] and I appreciate God for his mercy and
[21:50] to us
[21:53] truly you've been there for us through
[21:56] this year
[21:59] we have also tried
[22:02] to be there for our brethren
[22:05] um
[22:08] but it is my prayer that God continues
[22:11] to give us Unity
[22:13] that he will unite our hearts
[22:18] because there is a saying which says
[22:20] that the ones which are united they can
[22:23] eat
[22:24] every time we separate we despise but
[22:29] when we are united
[22:31] the devil cannot overcome us
[22:34] brother Brandon says
[22:40] that if the devil could only enter
[22:45] and make you fight
[22:49] he doesn't need to
[22:51] need he will just sit aside
[22:54] and let you fight each other
[22:59] but my prayer in this new year we have
[23:02] entered
[23:07] some conflict I thank God for that
[23:12] but I pray that we may be God maybe you
[23:16] unite us more at Westfield that he may
[23:19] give us
[23:30] that he will give us that that fast of
[23:34] pain
[23:38] but everybody will get an example they
[23:41] would want to be like in the scriptures
[23:43] from The Young and to the elders
[23:49] each one of us to get the holy spirit
[23:52] amen amen
[23:56] that is where the victory of any church
[24:11] for God
[24:16] that if we are serious with God
[24:20] even God will be serious with us
[24:30] [Applause]
[24:40] as I said unto Moses
[24:45] and the voices from the Wilderness

[47:14] yes sir wow
[47:17] when I got that accident
[47:20] I knocked that late
[47:22] God had confidence in me
[47:25] because first of all so the Bible says
[47:29] the angel of the Lord
[47:35] I was coming for service with my family
[47:39] and I was just leaving the parking like
[47:41] this
[47:44] foreign
[47:49] and somebody I know somebody
[47:52] but God had a confidence
[47:59] I sat back and and recalled that
[48:03] accident
[48:05] and I remembered my wife had not put on
[48:09] a seat belt
[48:11] and my children they are not put under
[48:13] there Mississippi
[48:15] so if we are not if we had not knocked
[48:18] her well
[48:20] remember she was carrying a baby
[48:24] with the mother and the people that
[48:26] heated their head on the dashboard
[48:33] anytime God does impossible man
[48:38] blessed with the name of the Lord he has
[48:41] a confidence
[48:42] in US I mean when you see our brothers
[48:45] being tried
[48:50] just go on your knees and pray for him
[48:53] say God gave him the grace
[48:56] that's why Apostle Peter says
[48:59] after going through this Friday try that
[49:02] I believe is James
[49:04] we shall come out like a pure God
[49:07] is calling and his it is
[49:12] time tested
[49:41] [Music]
[50:14] if we can't have faith enough for Divine
[50:17] Healing
[50:24] I mean
[50:27] amen Mina Joshua and Caleb yes
[50:34] they say
[50:35] we are more than able to
[50:41] come before us
[50:46] amen mean
[50:49] I'm about to finish
[50:51] let me hope I have not
[50:54] it's already
[50:55] okay thank you uh it is the fact that
[50:57] the prophet for the last eight must be
[50:59] bringing forth a message from God that
[51:02] will forerun the second coming of the
[51:04] Lord
[51:10] but by his message
[51:18] and with the restoration of the words
[51:35] saying that the land through which we
[51:38] have gone to such it is a land
[51:43] that the land was eating its inhabitants
[51:48] praise be to God seek
[51:53] but these men were seeing the milk and
[51:56] the Honey flowing in the fruits
[52:00] maybe that was the time when Caleb told
[52:03] Joshua that
[52:06] mountain there
[52:08] I've loved it yeah
[52:15] so when they went back what are you and
[52:19] they possessed the land
[52:21] and Caleb came back to Joshua
[52:24] and told him man give my mouth
[52:33] don't accept other people to see on your
[52:36] behalf the good thing
[52:39] they will take the bigger things fight
[52:44] and we inherit together blessed be the

[1:09:00] because I don't know where your lord is

[1:09:49] what I think it is good for me to talk
[1:09:52] about that
[1:09:55] and I think let us read in John chapter
[1:09:58] one
[1:10:14] let's start with 19.
[1:10:18] and this is the record of Jones
[1:10:22] when the Jews sent priests and Levits
[1:10:25] from Jerusalem to ask him
[1:10:32] and he confessed and denied the note but
[1:10:36] to confess I am not that Christ
[1:10:39] is Auntie
[1:10:45] foreign
[1:11:07] [Music]
[1:11:18] whether he was the prophet
[1:11:20] [Music]
[1:11:22] but we know the story of Jones
[1:11:26] was that sound in the wilderness
[1:11:35] that sound
[1:11:41] there is another word they wanted to use
[1:11:45] you know we shall get there okay we know
[1:11:47] that the story of John yeah
[1:11:51] John had a promise to come before the
[1:11:55] Lord
[1:12:02] so when he came he was telling people
[1:12:05] prepare the way for the Lord
[1:12:14] then he answered the saying
[1:12:17] I baptized with water but there stands
[1:12:21] among you whom he know note
[1:12:29] he it is Who coming after me is
[1:12:33] preferred before me whose shoes Legends
[1:12:37] I am not worth it to earn rules
[1:12:43] I think brother ranga continue reading
[1:12:46] up to
[1:12:47] about
[1:12:49] when I tell you to stop is
[1:13:16] [Music]
[1:13:23] [Music]
[1:13:33] [Music]
[1:13:49] foreign
[1:13:59] [Music]
[1:14:49] Jesus and he walked and he said Behold
[1:14:52] the Lamb of God
[1:14:54] and the two disciples had him speak and
[1:14:57] they followed Jesus then Jesus stand and
[1:15:00] saw them following and says unto them
[1:15:03] what seek ye they said unto him which is
[1:15:07] to say being interrupt interpreted
[1:15:10] Master where dwells thou
[1:15:15] and say it unto them
[1:15:17] come and see they came and saw where he
[1:15:22] dwelt and Abode with him that day for it
[1:15:26] was about the tennis hour
[1:15:29] Amina
[1:15:30] now I want to tell you about
[1:15:34] what what changed me
[1:15:37] and what changed me I believe is staying
[1:15:41] under the message
[1:15:44] and listening to the message
[1:15:48] listening to the preaching of the
[1:15:50] message
[1:15:52] no one preached to me this message
[1:15:59] and I escorted him to church
[1:16:02] I went to church
[1:16:09] then I listened to the message
[1:16:13] I got attracted to it
[1:16:16] I spent one one month without going
[1:16:20] I went back the next month
[1:16:23] it sounded so sweet
[1:16:25] I sat down and listened
[1:16:29] I think the next month I
[1:16:36] sat under the preaching of them
[1:16:40] like these boys these brothers
[1:16:44] who is
[1:16:47] when they saw Jesus
[1:16:50] they followed him and they went with him
[1:16:54] he spent with him the whole night

[1:33:49] foreign
[1:34:26] foreign
[1:34:55] [Music]
[1:35:04] because
[1:35:07] my work holds me so much
[1:35:11] thank God I remember I used to have
[1:35:13] challenges Friday then
[1:35:17] I pray to God and I changed that beauty
[1:35:21] so it is now my hope then
[1:35:28] I also had a challenge
[1:35:33] and I prayed to God and that beauty
[1:35:35] Saturday night was changed so I'm off
[1:35:38] Saturday night it helps me to be
[1:35:42] not to be very busy continuous
[1:35:49] then now I have a challenge with
[1:35:51] Wednesday
[1:35:54] because it's difficult for me to come on
[1:35:57] Wednesday
[1:36:00] forgive me so much
[1:36:03] I would like to address uh some few
[1:36:06] otherwise
[1:36:16] you know
[1:36:24] there are things which you you wouldn't
[1:36:26] want to directly talk to them what do I
[1:36:29] mean because you expect them to know
[1:36:33] for example if they we are reading the
[1:36:36] word categories
[1:36:38] wouldn't expect you to stay seated
[1:36:44] you may feel like I'm embarrassing
[1:36:49] so let's be guided I think
[1:36:54] now uh about four things
[1:36:58] first the mothers with the children
[1:37:04] you know the children they are not
[1:37:05] concerned about our things which we are
[1:37:08] doing
[1:37:10] so once in a while you know they are
[1:37:14] happy yes
[1:37:16] we request the mothers to always guide
[1:37:20] the children
[1:37:23] you know as I've told you if I come to
[1:37:26] the mother and tell you what you already
[1:37:27] you know what to do things
[1:37:35] it would seem like I'm embarrassing
[1:37:37] washrooms
[1:37:43] I thank the brothers
[1:37:51] we are having challenge sometimes there
[1:37:54] is the water is not enough
[1:37:57] sometimes maybe the tissues
[1:38:03] we want to organize ourselves this year
[1:38:07] when you come to church you should feel
[1:38:10] comfortable in every aspect
[1:38:15] so I think that's what we should do so
[1:38:18] that as you come to church you should
[1:38:21] consecrate all the time which the little
[1:38:23] you have for the service
[1:38:30] now when you come from the washroom
[1:38:34] we have always ensured there is water
[1:38:40] don't enter the church without washing
[1:38:42] your house
[1:38:46] [Music]
[1:38:50] then now we have
[1:38:54] um outbreak of coffee coffee
[1:38:59] I think this disease is not a respecter
[1:39:04] whether you're from praying
[1:39:08] tax
[1:39:13] my advice the the best you can is to
[1:39:16] wash your hands I'm against again single
[1:39:18] power mungaru
[1:39:22] because as much as you may shake hands
[1:39:32] um
[1:39:33] then there is this concerned
[1:39:37] when a minister is on the pulpit to pray
[1:39:40] um
[1:39:48] do not move around
[1:39:52] you know sometimes you know they are
[1:39:55] praying and then some people want to
[1:39:57] move around
[1:40:05] some people respect to the national
[1:40:07] anthem
[1:40:11] I think we should also respect what we
[1:40:14] consider important
[1:40:19] yes
[1:40:21] things like when we are reading the word
[1:40:25] somebody is praying
[1:40:27] even if you are outside and you're late
[1:40:41] foreign
[1:40:58] [Music]
[1:41:12] you are
[1:41:14] you know that brother called me one day
[1:41:18] you know I was on duty that it was night
[1:41:24] brother I want to see you
[1:41:30] for the problems
[1:41:35] then we talked to some things he knows
[1:41:38] them better money
[1:41:41] brother
[1:41:42] is it okay
[1:41:47] you know it's so good if you accept to
[1:41:50] be guided
[1:41:54] in about 12 years since I believed the
[1:41:57] word um
[1:42:02] you know there may be things which are
[1:42:04] passed through although I mean to be an
[1:42:06] item
[1:42:07] maybe I can give you a small advice
[1:42:12] you know that brother is a very sweet
[1:42:14] spirit
[1:42:16] I think what he does I may not be able
[1:42:20] to do it
[1:42:24] Pastor I am I'm having this what do you
[1:42:27] advise me you know such a thing
[1:42:31] he had a challenge I think he was
[1:42:35] arranging something like a marriage yeah
[1:42:38] you know obviously but
[1:42:40] I think the sister was not a believer
[1:42:45] you know those types
[1:42:49] so he was asking me if there is a way to
[1:42:53] turn it around so that he can take
[1:42:55] everything
[1:43:04] and I want to thank God
[1:43:07] I believe the brother took my heart
[1:43:18] there are many times we fall into
[1:43:19] mistakes
[1:43:21] because we are not humble enough
[1:43:25] may God bless you brother so much
[1:43:28] [Music]
[1:43:30] uh
[1:43:35] I don't want to play so much I think I
[1:43:37] maybe I have five or ten minutes
[1:43:40] I thank God for the previous year
[1:43:46] he blessed me with a small motorcycle
[1:43:47] yeah
[1:43:52] you're not grateful for the small things
[1:43:55] God has given you um
[1:44:12] some people
[1:44:14] when they pray to God
[1:44:17] maybe they expect one Millions
[1:44:28] I think this this is not something
[1:44:32] you know this is even in some brethren
[1:44:35] I'm sorry it's safe
[1:44:39] foreign
[1:45:07] [Music]
[1:45:14] The Grateful outreaching of your mind in
[1:45:17] thankful praise to the Supreme Buddhism
[1:45:21] um
[1:45:25] is a liberation
[1:45:27] of force awaited
[1:45:32] cannot fail to reach that to which it is
[1:45:35] addressed again
[1:45:41] and the reaction is an instantaneous
[1:45:43] movement towards you
[1:45:47] foreign
[1:46:29] you say it does not come on time okay
[1:46:33] it is a small small
[1:46:36] you know then you shut down that much
[1:46:41] [Music]
[1:46:44] however when you thank
[1:46:48] God
[1:46:51] somebody may be touched
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:46:53] it
[1:46:58] if you don't appreciate the lead to God
[1:47:01] has given you is not going to give you
[1:47:04] big things
[1:47:08] this is the advice to our women
[1:47:11] if I give you something small when
[1:47:15] you thank me you know I may even have
[1:47:19] more yeah
[1:47:25] but
[1:47:26] I choose to for the moment to give you
[1:47:29] something
[1:47:29] [Music]
[1:47:31] so if you keep quiet about it
[1:47:38] I don't think you may get personally
[1:47:43] that's one thing I want to uh
[1:47:50] please report to the prophet
[1:47:54] is
[1:47:56] one message
[1:48:04] we are grateful to thee tonight
[1:48:08] to have a privilege of living foreign
[1:48:44] we must be grateful manga
[1:48:48] if you are not grateful to a fellow man
[1:48:53] it's difficult to do it for God
[1:48:57] I want to talk to you about three people
[1:49:00] always
[1:49:11] you can just cry okay
[1:49:14] if you are a housewife
[1:49:17] and instead of talking a lot to just
[1:49:20] crash
[1:49:21] [Music]
[1:49:24] to me that's better
[1:49:26] so testimonies
[1:49:29] by the way
[1:49:33] there are some people
[1:49:36] some people
[1:49:38] who don't know how to express
[1:49:40] their gratitude
[1:49:44] [Music]
[1:49:46] you know it should be something which
[1:49:48] comes from the heart
[1:49:51] God is not interested in a lot of words
[1:49:57] you may not
[1:50:00] you may not tell what I thank you
[1:50:02] foreign
[1:50:06] [Music]
[1:50:13] testimonies
[1:50:18] way or showing you that you thank God
[1:50:35] then lastly
[1:50:40] giving not only in church
[1:50:46] love a fellow man no
[1:50:50] and you think you're going to give to
[1:50:52] the God only in church
[1:51:08] we have
[1:51:10] every girl today
[1:51:22] [Music]
[1:51:31] God has
[1:51:33] healed me miraculous testimony
[1:51:41] but there's no time one time I had a
[1:51:45] painfulness
[1:51:48] seven years ago
[1:51:54] they were praying
[1:51:56] it was a Congolese preacher about
[1:52:05] Randy
[1:52:09] then as you're just there my brother
[1:52:12] then something
[1:52:15] tells you to move away
[1:52:21] and there was no pain it's not because I
[1:52:25] was praying soon
[1:52:26] God can
[1:52:29] God is sovereign
[1:52:55] when you're in the Sun
[1:52:57] you know you develop that itching
[1:53:00] because of the radiations
[1:53:13] and sometimes Divine Healing takes time
[1:53:19] is like nothing is happening
[1:53:31] now
[1:53:35] I don't remember when the healing
[1:53:38] happens
[1:53:39] I just looked back some about two years
[1:53:43] ago and this thing was not coming hello
[1:53:49] then uh I want to thank God we almost
[1:53:53] died in a bad accidents
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:54:10] I think
[1:54:12] were supposed to have fractures
[1:54:17] and you know this happened I used to
[1:54:20] just escape from work and come for night
[1:54:23] prayers to
[1:54:33] but this the last one was the bad one
[1:54:36] the motorcycle was not crashed
[1:54:39] potatoes
[1:54:41] [Music]
[1:54:48] [Music]
[1:54:59] the man who tried to run away and leave
[1:55:02] the abandoned on the car tomorrow
[1:55:13] and blood group b plus
[1:55:17] and my wife is blood group or negative
[1:55:20] uh negative
[1:55:23] positive cutting negative what you got
[1:55:25] any positive
[1:55:26] no it brings a mismatch
[1:55:30] I don't know if you'll understand
[1:55:39] you know it's something like if I'm
[1:55:42] blood group and I give my blood to
[1:55:45] somebody blood groups
[1:55:56] so this situation happened the first the
[1:55:59] first child will usually survive much
[1:56:06] but the second we usually nice
[1:56:11] and that's the families which you
[1:56:14] usually have miscarriage
[1:56:20] because the beginning of which the
[1:56:22] mother gets
[1:56:25] recognized by the body of the mother
[1:56:29] as a foreign
[1:56:35] kill this
[1:56:42] if science is true this this is what was
[1:56:45] supposed to happen for my from my
[1:56:46] daughter because
[1:56:50] but you know I trust the medicine and
[1:56:54] all that is
[1:56:59] I go to Revelation to believe
[1:57:04] and once the Revelation comes you feel
[1:57:07] relaxed
[1:57:10] truthfully speaking I didn't have
[1:57:13] because it's about eight hundred
[1:57:15] thousand Amazon
[1:57:18] because there is some vaccine we usually
[1:57:22] use to calm down that reactions
[1:57:29] but I want to tell you
[1:57:31] that God can even do what our science
[1:57:34] says
[1:57:39] to me that is
[1:57:46] [Applause]
[1:57:57] to those who don't know
[1:58:02] londe
[1:58:04] is also a medical doctor
[1:58:07] so if you didn't understand those
[1:58:10] explanations

[1:58:29] many families
[1:58:32] you know they call him even to us here
[1:58:36] not fair I know I don't remember the
[1:58:38] last time we went to the hospital
[1:58:45] he does the
[1:58:48] prescription
[1:58:49] you go by the medicine
[1:58:52] and the child becomes
[1:58:56] um he's been a blessing to the body
[1:58:59] and we we want to say God bless you so
[1:59:02] much
[1:59:03] may you be more of a blessing in this

[2:04:30] [Music]
[2:04:40] camera
[2:04:52] Isaac
[2:04:57] because
[2:05:00] [Music]
[2:05:15] it's it's a deep honor
[2:05:20] that the Lord has given me a chance to
[2:05:22] stand before you um
[2:05:28] you are the most precious in all this
[2:05:31] world I mean God doesn't care about the
[2:05:33] Stars the sun you are his most precious
[2:05:43] so I'm going to be brief I mean everyone
[2:05:46] has said they're going to be briefing
[2:05:49] is
[2:05:52] to use that word I'm going to start with
[2:05:55] a song it's called such love
[2:06:01] and I'm just going to report not to sing
[2:06:08] it says that Christ should join so
[2:06:11] freely in the scheme
[2:06:18] although it meant his death
[2:06:24] whatever human tank Vines
[2:06:28] [Music]
[2:06:39] than love divine that runs on us
[2:06:46] it's my favorite part
[2:06:49] that far will fall outcasts such as
[2:06:56] the
[2:07:00] Savior Bleed and died enough
[2:07:04] Redemption for a worthless slave to buy
[2:07:10] who long had law and Grace
[2:07:16] [Music]
[2:07:20] so um I've I've titled my short term
[2:07:24] meet yeah
[2:07:28] I've tried to teach
[2:07:31] undeservedly deserving
[2:07:40] so I'm just going to run through a Short
[2:07:44] scripture here
[2:07:49] it has been my driving force I think
[2:07:52] since secondary Church
[2:07:58] even when I did not understand it fully
[2:08:04] the Lord was gracious enough to help me
[2:08:07] understand
[2:08:20] and he that formed thee
[2:08:23] or Israel
[2:08:26] not for I have redeemed
[2:08:31] I have called thee by thy name
[2:08:37] when thou passes through the waters
[2:08:44] and through the rivers
[2:08:49] when thou walk is through the fire
[2:08:55] neither shall the Flamez
[2:09:15] and since thou worst precious in myself
[2:09:23] foreign
[2:10:22] um as a Christian style it scares me so
[2:10:26] much that uh at some point there is that
[2:10:29] line between us making it to heaven
[2:10:35] and the other people
[2:10:39] going the other side
[2:10:43] but this has been proved and it has been
[2:10:46] certain
[2:10:49] in verse 11 if you get time and read
[2:10:52] there
[2:10:54] I even
[2:10:56] I am the Lord and beside me there is no
[2:11:00] service
[2:11:04] this is the Old Testament you should
[2:11:07] know so he used the word severeign
[2:12:17] even when it meant him being an
[2:12:20] outcaster yeah so
[2:12:25] um a lot of times
[2:12:27] at all times
[2:12:29] we are all undiserable
[2:12:32] we we did not work this thing out we did
[2:12:36] not
[2:12:37] breaking news
[2:12:41] we we are only blessed
[2:12:44] before the foundation of the Earth
[2:12:58] the Bible says that nothing can separate
[2:13:01] us
[2:13:04] because we are part of
[2:13:07] [Music]
[2:13:08] the pastor previously said in the last
[2:13:11] preaching
[2:13:14] we have no place in hell
[2:14:14] since we are part of you foreign
[2:14:37] [Music]
[2:15:26] um yeah I mean my life was not so
[2:15:29] strange
[2:15:33] um but because God knew me
[2:15:37] he called me out by name
[2:15:41] he humbled me through what they call a
[2:15:43] masterpiece plan
[2:15:47] because if you've listened to that
[2:15:49] someone
[2:15:53] is foreign
[2:16:39] so I mean uh it is very fascinating
[2:16:43] that God keeps choosing us even when we
[2:16:46] record
[2:16:49] and we are very blessed that Mercy keeps
[2:16:53] rewriting us
[2:16:57] that every time we choose to go south
[2:17:02] God says it is not for you
[2:17:06] he said where you want to go again I
[2:17:10] paid that as a run
[2:17:16] so uh that is how beautiful I I take my
[2:17:21] Jesus
[2:17:24] and uh a bit about my life
[2:17:27] I'm very grateful uh
[2:17:31] I think I always dreamed about very
[2:17:34] crazy things
[2:17:39] at some point I was a dancer
[2:17:43] [Music]
[2:17:44] um
[2:17:45] yeah yeah I mean I've I think I wrote
[2:17:49] some songs back then but
[2:17:53] I I think I used to think I'd be a
[2:17:56] hip-hop
[2:17:59] but I mean on a pool place
[2:18:05] [Laughter]
[2:18:10] and it is surprising I can testify I
[2:18:13] mean it's been years
[2:18:14] I had thoughts to go to a club
[2:18:19] and when you're out of it now
[2:18:23] you can understand the scripture
[2:18:25] necklaces
[2:18:40] and you're spending money
[2:18:44] so you know it is very absurd but this
[2:18:50] is where the Lord had to draw me
[2:18:53] and uh
[2:18:55] I gave him a promise
[2:18:58] and just like the man Gideon gideoni
[2:19:03] I am
[2:19:05] I am I I I gave him tests I think so
[2:19:12] and it is very
[2:19:16] good and painful that he has fulfilled
[2:19:19] everyone
[2:19:24] as a human you always want him to fail
[2:19:26] so that you have Justified
[2:19:34] when I reach in heaven you're like I'll
[2:19:36] draw a master plan I'll tell him you're
[2:19:38] not good I asked you for this you
[2:19:40] refused
[2:19:46] I mean he shaped the Stars
[2:19:50] more intelligent than all of us
[2:19:53] he has outsmarted me at every point
[2:19:59] and I'm very grateful to him
[2:20:02] and to the people here
[2:20:05] I want to tell you I love every single
[2:20:08] one of you
[2:20:10] at a general level
[2:20:15] individual
[2:20:38] he gave me the clothes in which I was
[2:20:40] baptized
[2:20:43] and I am forever indebted to him
[2:20:47] time the Lord has used him in very very
[2:20:50] different ways to change my life
[2:20:59] [Music]
[2:21:00] and a little bit of Jewel somewhere
[2:21:04] when I had just entered the message
[2:21:07] I used to question a lot
[2:21:12] uh it seemed I don't want to say it was
[2:21:16] it seemed like I was questioning the
[2:21:19] word of God
[2:21:56] I just know our God is faithful and he
[2:21:59] approaches every one of us because we
[2:22:02] are all shaped in a very unique way
[2:22:12] the way he approached me is different
[2:22:15] from the way he talked to brothers
[2:22:20] and to the people who have kept on
[2:22:23] giving me chances I mean I've wasted a
[2:22:25] lot of them I've disappointed
[2:22:28] uh
[2:22:29] disappointed a lot of people in
[2:22:31] different ways
[2:22:35] I'm sorry
[2:22:40] I am not sorry the camera is here
[2:22:46] that is the basic of what I had to share
[2:22:52] and just in a way
[2:22:55] of wrapping up what I have to say
[2:23:00] God's love is freely given
[2:23:03] without conditions
[2:23:06] and he has clearly told us
[2:23:09] that even when we sinned
[2:23:13] he will not find any sin on you
[2:23:17] because he's so beautiful
[2:23:20] the day I got this Revelation
[2:23:24] you see he's good katonda he's sitting
[2:23:28] up here and then he's the high priest
[2:23:31] and then he's our advocacy
[2:23:41] just keep in your position
[2:23:45] [Music]
[2:23:46] and abide in your callings
[2:23:50] it is going to be a long process
[2:23:54] [Music]
[2:23:55] that the Lord is faithful
[2:24:00] a cup an encounter with God yes
[2:24:07] did not ask for his brother's life
[2:24:12] he did not ask God for land
[2:24:16] he asked God for a blessing yes
[2:24:28] sometimes with prayer Miss
[2:24:31] but Jacob has encouraged me in very many
[2:24:34] ways
[2:24:36] not even in the worst of situations
[2:24:40] he stood a chance to say God help my
[2:24:44] brother forgive me and then I'll go back
[2:24:46] and it's done
[2:24:51] he had the chance to say what brother
[2:24:53] Henry said

[2:27:07] speak
[2:27:09] you may not understand
[2:27:15] the people at home here
[2:27:20] I believe I am a solid believer
[2:27:25] that God can change anyone
[2:27:31] and because I've seen him do it
[2:27:35] and in the message getting in the spirit
[2:27:39] brother says listen very careful
[2:27:42] what we need is not psychology moves
[2:27:46] [Music]
[2:27:52] but we need a Holy Spirit
[2:27:56] here
[2:27:58] the people cry out
[2:28:02] he says where is that God that once
[2:28:16] and washes
[2:28:21] who takes a prostitute
[2:28:24] from the street
[2:28:27] makes a lady out of it
[2:28:30] who takes a drunkard now you've had a
[2:28:34] young man tell you he was going to the
[2:28:35] bus

[2:28:40] What DJ it takes a drunk out of the
[2:28:45] bathroom

[2:28:49] [Music]
[2:28:50] is this a prophet saying
[2:28:52] where is that God
[2:28:55] that can move out
[2:28:59] legs
[2:29:03] and make those blind eyes
[2:29:09] to hear um
[2:29:14] amen
[2:29:28] [Music]
[2:29:30] I asked him to give a testimony
[2:29:32] he want to preach it
[2:29:35] what made him do that
[2:29:39] foreign
[2:29:46] [Music]
[2:29:47] together
[2:30:00] [Music]
[2:30:03] praise the name of the Lord
[2:30:07] I think before I hand it over to brother
[2:30:09] uh
[2:30:11] to brother
[2:30:13] brother
[2:30:16] because after brother
[2:30:19] we'll take a little break
[2:30:21] and have a roasted this young man who
[2:30:25] has been preaching to us as is roasting
[2:30:27] uh
[2:30:30] foreign
[2:30:43] [Music]
[2:31:01] [Music]
[2:31:09] [Music]
[2:31:12] if I had time to give a testament about
[2:31:14] all these people I'm inviting here would
[2:31:16] not end
[2:31:18] up
[2:31:21] but brother Isaac come and give your
[2:31:24] testimony
[2:31:25] I don't know what it is about
[2:31:28] but I know it's about the power of God
[2:31:30] Amen
[2:31:38] and then brother Rwanda will close with
[2:31:43] this first session
[2:31:46] oh that's why I'm dressed
[2:31:55] [Music]
[2:32:10] up
[2:32:15] um
[2:32:17] I really don't know where I can start
[2:32:20] from the kid
[2:32:26] my starting point is the same as my
[2:32:30] endpoint can is
[2:32:41] so
[2:32:43] [Music]
[2:32:47] safe
[2:32:49] I'm here to give a testimony
[2:32:54] and say that I'm so grateful one God has
[2:32:59] done for me
[2:33:03] foreign
[2:33:04] [Music]
[2:33:24] [Music]
[2:33:34] so me standing here right now
[2:33:38] I can say that of all of you who are
[2:33:41] here
[2:33:45] because I believe no one has such a
[2:33:49] thing
[2:33:51] to engage
[2:33:57] so
[2:33:59] I don't know where to start but it was
[2:34:01] to be briefly
[2:34:05] uh
[2:34:07] in mathematics
[2:34:09] we have what we call a distance time
[2:34:13] graph
[2:34:17] distance time graph
[2:34:19] so this graph graph where you
[2:34:25] you have distance on this side
[2:34:31] for it to be steady
[2:34:35] it has to be moving straight like this
[2:34:39] is straight so when it's straight like
[2:34:42] this
[2:34:46] one is a distance or time
[2:34:51] is
[2:34:52] at zero and one is moving straight
[2:34:56] so one is accelerating like the distance
[2:34:59] is continuing but that time is not
[2:35:01] moving
[2:35:11] so foreign
[2:35:15] steadily it has to be moving in
[2:35:19] like the time moving at this just moving
[2:35:25] [Music]
[2:35:27] all right so I want to say that
[2:35:31] um
[2:35:32] it was around
[2:35:34] um almost at the beginning of this year
[2:35:38] and uh
[2:35:45] and uh I came back
[2:35:49] uh
[2:35:50] to Uganda
[2:35:53] Uganda
[2:35:58] and you know I've seen many people
[2:36:03] mean inclusive
[2:36:05] who have been there you know thinking
[2:36:08] that here in this country
[2:36:11] there are the now I'm speaking
[2:36:16] um
[2:36:17] in physical terms
[2:36:21] so it can be a testimony it can build
[2:36:23] you mind
[2:36:25] but spiritual and more your name
[2:36:29] so um
[2:36:31] I returned
[2:36:34] from uh where I'd gone to work
[2:36:40] and um
[2:36:42] I had nothing
[2:36:46] when I talk about nothing I mean
[2:36:57] so
[2:36:58] now I want to show you what God can do
[2:37:05] so
[2:37:06] um
[2:37:08] came to the church
[2:37:10] after a long time
[2:37:14] and um
[2:37:16] thank you the Brethren who were there
[2:37:20] we pray and all of the things we pray
[2:37:23] was
[2:37:29] God's blessings
[2:37:33] because I had nothing
[2:37:37] if everyone's prayer was something
[2:37:43] so um
[2:37:47] I really give my heart out tomorrow
[2:37:52] and God had my prayers
[2:37:59] I didn't even know that maybe life would
[2:38:01] change
[2:38:05] this is the transition
[2:38:10] zero to one and then Counting please
[2:38:15] so now
[2:38:17] um it was I think weeks there was a
[2:38:20] wider we keep weak I started praying for
[2:38:23] a joke
[2:38:24] [Music]
[2:38:26] uh I could say I could come to the past
[2:38:29] I said
[2:38:31] it's a very difficult yeah you could
[2:38:34] tell me the number
[2:38:37] there's only one like it's like hello
[2:38:41] with Christ
[2:38:53] if you are looking for a joke
[2:38:59] you can't get it
[2:39:02] yes we know God may be maybe testing
[2:39:09] there's something wrong in your life so
[2:39:14] I took that one
[2:39:17] so it was like two weeks after time
[2:39:29] so some of you if any of you is applying
[2:39:33] for jobs
[2:39:34] [Music]

[2:40:45] after like seven minutes I saw people
[2:40:47] giving games

[2:42:26] [Music]
[2:42:38] this is a true story
[2:42:45] so because I was you know I didn't
[2:42:48] expect it is
[2:43:03] [Music]
[2:43:13] now
[2:43:15] about this
[2:43:18] I don't know uh
[2:43:20] you know it was a joke
[2:43:25] health insurance so
[2:43:48] they say okay come tomorrow
[2:44:07] so they were giving me that money and
[2:44:08] I'm the one who asked for it
[2:44:11] when I asked for the money they didn't
[2:44:14] say that I know we shall give you this
[2:44:17] is
[2:44:19] the money that I asked they gave to me
[2:44:22] exactly so
[2:44:28] thank God it was a cartoon
[2:44:34] so that was it
[2:44:37] that is dumb
[2:44:40] the movement

[2:46:40] so we're about 13 people
[2:46:44] time for us
[2:46:47] [Music]
[2:46:49] I remembered the word

[2:47:02] you came for our company
[2:47:04] Etc
[2:47:10] we are late
[2:47:19] foreign
[2:47:23] have not yet come to the main test
[2:47:29] that was the time I felt like
[2:47:32] the money I asked
[2:47:35] centers
[2:47:38] I have to
[2:47:40] turn it around
[2:47:43] destroyed all those leaves
[2:47:46] [Music]
[2:47:59] yes I had to claim it
[2:48:02] um
[2:48:05] yet the first sorry I'm the one who does
[2:48:10] but right now I wanted something more
[2:48:14] not being greedy
[2:48:17] but as a Christian
[2:48:19] must be
[2:48:21] hates way
[2:48:26] foreign
[2:48:33] turned around
[2:49:00] I wanted to increase your salary by the
[2:49:02] way
[2:49:07] but may I the truth is he never said it
[2:49:11] um
[2:49:11] in the beginning he never said that he
[2:49:14] wanted to increase
[2:49:16] but when I told him
[2:49:20] by the way I wanted to increase it so
[2:49:26] yes we are going to
[2:49:28] go into it
[2:49:37] Uganda
[2:49:38] all right
[2:49:40] so I'm not going to say how much seconds
[2:49:50] but what I can say is that
[2:49:54] some company managers
[2:50:01] so this really makes me think
[2:50:08] ing
[2:50:12] uh this is uh I think the second month
[2:50:20] we are starting the new year
[2:50:24] with new resolutions
[2:50:28] [Music]
[2:50:35] this company in Uganda you know company
[2:50:38] Uganda they are also so interested
[2:50:42] they are interested in
[2:50:46] like since I got involved in the work
[2:50:52] now we do recruitment
[2:50:57] recruitment
[2:51:01] companies
[2:51:06] and these are the big companies
[2:51:10] like Microsoft Microsoft
[2:51:13] if you know Johnson and Johnson
[2:51:16] vaccines
[2:51:19] so these companies and companies are
[2:51:23] all the people that I found working
[2:51:25] there
[2:51:29] they have been working only that role
[2:51:32] but when I got there God favors me names
[2:51:42] that it gives me a
[2:51:45] Authority Empire
[2:51:49] National functions
[2:51:53] many times different places which is
[2:51:57] also an opportunity that no one has so
[2:52:04] I'm here to tell you
[2:52:07] God is more faithful than new things
[2:52:12] this is why I come to say that
[2:52:16] this year
[2:52:18] the point where I can say it has been my
[2:52:21] best
[2:52:32] uh rather
[2:52:35] everyone has talked about actually
[2:52:38] I use a border border every day to and
[2:52:41] frothy
[2:52:47] we hear people uh
[2:52:49] getting uh killed by accidents
[2:52:53] they said you know what everyone should
[2:52:56] buy a helmet
[2:52:59] but I've taken trips more than 100 to
[2:53:02] and fro dumb
[2:53:05] I've not even ever been involved in one
[2:53:08] yes
[2:53:10] [Music]
[2:53:14] I'm not bragging
[2:53:18] but the truth is what is faithful
[2:53:22] and I believe he has more plans so
[2:53:29] [Music]
[2:53:39] I can't say everything
[2:53:44] so thankful
[2:53:48] foreign
[2:54:24] [Music]
[2:54:30] has pushed us to lead me to to uh limits
[2:54:34] how to seen this natural language
[2:54:43] like me myself I got a point
[2:54:48] where I default like
[2:54:50] there's no numbers
[2:55:00] so
[2:55:07] may God bless you sir
[2:55:14] thank you for praying for me
[2:55:17] and we pray that you give me your
[2:55:19] prayers
[2:55:34] day

[2:56:07] foreign
[2:56:28] [Music]
[2:56:31] no he has committed
[2:56:35] this year um
[2:56:49] you have some financial trouble
[2:56:52] you have had a testimony I think it was
[2:56:55] worth hearing
[2:56:58] can encourage us
[2:57:00] that God is also able to provide
[2:57:03] Financial
[2:57:08] [Music]
[2:57:15] understanding to collect our to when we
[2:57:18] started the church
[2:57:20] those who don't have jobs
[2:57:26] and uh I believe if you've not committed
[2:57:29] anything
[2:57:33] and uh you know Isaac's testimony is
[2:57:36] just amazing
[2:57:38] you know like he said he went abroad
[2:57:41] yeah out of God is will because I came
[2:57:46] back with nothing
[2:57:48] but because he came back and started out
[2:57:52] into God's way
[2:57:54] God blessed him
[2:57:56] with a blessing he was not even able to
[2:57:59] get abroad
[2:58:01] so people think
[2:58:03] people think let them go out and look
[2:58:06] for money if you're a Believer and you
[2:58:08] are here never try that
[2:58:10] you better be in the goddess
[2:58:18] the blessing is always

[2:58:29] testimony and he has given his testimony
[2:58:35] praise the name of the Lord I am so

[3:05:19] for this day
[3:05:21] ladies and gentlemen
[3:05:25] our Lord's lives

[3:05:43] be tempted to think that other people
[3:05:45] giving testimonies are liars
[3:05:50] sometimes you might get angry and be
[3:05:53] like maybe good works for those people
[3:05:56] ladies and gentlemen our god

[3:06:02] God's statement but brother Branham made
[3:06:05] a statement
[3:06:08] the Lord answers every prayer
[3:06:13] but he answers them according to his
[3:06:16] will
[3:06:18] that is the
[3:06:30] for the Lord
[3:06:32] hallelujah hallelujah
[3:06:37] it had a lot of challenges
[3:06:42] if you do not want problems
[3:06:47] to elevate to that level that praises
[3:06:49] the Lord
[3:06:53] foreign
[3:07:49] [Music]
[3:07:52] I was wondering did job really meet God

[3:07:58] like
[3:08:05] after he had taken him through all those
[3:08:08] challenges praise the Lord
[3:08:32] he wanted to kneel down
[3:08:35] ladies and gentlemen
[3:08:39] [Music]
