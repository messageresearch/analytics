[9:05] battle is the lord is
[9:25] our god does not save you because you
[9:27] fall with a spear or with a sword
[9:33] over
[10:05] you see all these sufferings and the
[10:08] problems we go through in this world
[10:12] it's not ours to fight or tell us
[10:16] that you are in christ since the grace
[10:18] sister grace of christ it's not yours to
[10:21] fight or tell us
[10:23] is there anybody here in christ

[10:30] he is a new
[10:36] [Music]
[10:40] which means i am not mine but i am of
[10:42] the lord
[10:44] it's a
[10:54] that's why the bible says unto them that
[10:56] stumble the children of god
[11:10] [Applause]
[11:13] you remember that one day when moses is
[11:15] his wife but you created me one muslim
[11:18] you know this king wanted to take her
[11:20] care
[11:21] and you know he lied about it he said
[11:23] she is my sister
[11:26] but you see remember he was a son of god
[11:31] of that god was ready to fight his
[11:33] battle
[11:38] he was he had even told a lie
[11:45] [Music]
[11:54] and god fights for all his possessions
[11:59] oh that belongs to god god always claims
[12:02] it
[12:06] not
[12:06] people but also things sinnoh wobble and
[12:10] heavy into whatever is of god god claims
[12:12] it canadian catholic
[12:14] and he came to that king
[12:16] and he said get ready
[12:19] you are going to die
[12:21] but i have done whatever
[12:34] god became like uh you know appeased
[13:04] god
[13:32] it
[13:46] the word of god satan inaudible
[13:50] if you remember when jesus the bible
[13:52] talks of jesus
[13:54] when he went uh
[13:56] after he had fasted for 40 days
[13:59] and he was coming down nakawansi then
[14:02] that's where the devil met i was
[14:04] standing i'm sinking
[14:05] now we begin to paint physical images
[14:08] you see jesus was there and the devil
[14:09] was there and we were walking together
[14:14] yesterday
[14:21] was speaking to jesus in his mind
[14:28] if you be the son of god women are
[14:30] catholic command these stones to be made
[14:32] brave
[14:35] if you be the son of a man
[14:37] you know for you know just jump off this
[14:40] building
[14:42] he's saying
[14:43] [Music]
[14:57] [Music]
[15:49] [Applause]
[16:33] is to engage in a fight
[16:39] against something
[16:43] you know people fight every day
[16:46] but here we have among all those who
[16:48] have been great fighters in the world
[16:52] the greatest of them is jesus
[16:56] is called the mighty conquerors
[16:59] conquer the hell death and the christ
[17:17] he says now this greatest contest has
[17:19] been going on for many years
[17:24] it started in heaven
[17:26] and saturn was kicked out into the earth
[17:45] people across the fires
[17:50] throw them into into his fires
[17:54] but we know that
[17:56] who has the most power and too
[18:52] and he wants to throw the children of
[18:54] god into
[20:07] hallelujah amen
[20:09] don't think even that god will make a
[20:11] fire for the devil
[20:13] now
[20:15] god will throw the devil into his own
[20:17] fire
[20:18] [Music]
[20:49] amen praise the name of the lord
[20:51] hallelujah and he says it becomes our
[20:53] strength
[20:56] the word of god is our stretch
[20:58] man you got faith
[20:59] but the word of god is my
[21:57] amen
[21:58] but he says again and the third goes on
[22:03] that jesus said in mark 16 in my name
[22:05] they shall cast out them yes
[22:09] and this battle began in heaven
[22:13] and there was war in heaven
[22:17] these angels fought against a dragon and
[22:19] a dragon fought on his angels
[22:38] in your mind
[23:05] let me tell you
[25:22] he thought he can defeat jesus even in
[25:24] his own heavens
[25:40] his own
[25:54] [Music]
[26:31] you know as he was beginning you know he
[26:33] said well i feel like uh
[26:35] i can be lifted
[27:05] you know what the devil then began to
[27:08] uh
[27:09] you know to lift himself up
[27:12] onto the throne of god
[27:14] and you see god is god when you get told
[27:16] that you can turn down and it does
[27:18] change to do something you're back which
[27:19] and not
[27:21] is to manifest himself in a way
[27:25] yes we're talking about the angelic
[27:27] realms
[27:30] you're talking about the devil in the
[27:32] form of angel know in the form of spirit
[27:34] talking about standing god
[27:35] he wasn't flesh and blood
[27:38] but then also god was a spirit
[27:41] he was not flesh and blessed
[27:43] see god could not stoop so lord to fight
[27:46] the devil himself
[28:12] you know god had to
[28:14] come in
[28:23] now i might as well say that michael was
[28:26] uh
[28:27] was a representation of god in the
[28:28] angelic
[28:36] just like jesus is the manifestation or
[28:38] representation of god in the human form
[28:46] [Music]
[28:55] came down
[29:24] so he was no longer lucifer now he
[29:25] became dragons
[29:28] he became a monster
[29:32] he became devil
[29:34] i know his name
[29:36] and so
[29:37] michael fought against
[29:53] [Music]
[30:34] even
[30:48] i don't know how they
[31:31] chassis he speaks to them
[31:33] and he inspires them
[31:36] you know
[32:11] he
[32:12] commanded all these
[32:51] [Music]
[33:06] [Music]
[34:18] and
[34:46] authority
[35:28] now you've been stripped of all the
[35:31] power
[35:32] command
[35:33] hallelujah amen the battle is the lord
[35:38] the battle is the lord
[35:41] oh my we are fighting
[35:43] and the battle is the lord i don't tell
[35:44] you
[35:45] and he prevailed
[35:47] neither was their place found anymore in
[35:49] heaven
[35:52] let me tell you something
[35:55] when the devil failed
[36:03] [Music]
[36:25] [Music]
[36:39] whatever angular it means he has no more
[36:42] blessing in my life
[36:46] amen
[36:48] that's why he says
[37:34] did not prevail
[37:37] [Applause]
[37:44] hallelujah when the devil comes and
[37:46] fights you standing by you can see that
[37:48] disease
[38:02] [Applause]
[38:36] did not and cannot have any more
[38:38] blessings
[38:41] for music the joy of the lord will be
[38:43] your stress
[39:12] it's not what
[39:40] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[39:44] and the great dragon was cast out
[39:48] of that old sapping
[39:50] called the devil
[39:52] and saturn
[39:54] which deceived the
[40:07] is deceiving them
[40:36] into the garden
[40:44] [Music]
[41:04] i got you
[41:18] he
[41:21] overcame eve now angular
[41:25] again
[41:26] he overcame
[41:28] now i'm gonna add them that is done i
[41:29] got my moments

[41:34] finish i got you a day
[41:36] oh
[41:37] my goodness
[41:39] they never made the biggest mystery
[41:43] he thought the battle was
[41:45] battling
[43:24] hallelujah
[43:38] where
[43:49] [Applause]
[44:48] because he could not remember
[44:51] he could
[44:52] whenever he would come close to jesus
[44:55] he would smell now
[44:57] something that happened
[45:00] but again
[45:02] he would see
[46:12] god
[46:38] [Music]

[48:02] the one who was always excited in chat
[48:30] we should make our own ends we should
[48:32] make we should meet our own ends
[48:35] because we cannot just follow blindly
[48:38] and maybe he told one of the brothers

[49:00] we
[49:28] it was the devil theory
[49:29] you knew how to speak a brethren in his
