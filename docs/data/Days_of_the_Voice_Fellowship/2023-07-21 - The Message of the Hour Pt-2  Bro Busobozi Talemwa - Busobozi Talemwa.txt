TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen I mean amen [Applause] I would like to reach you once again in the name of Jesus Christ that the Lord is giving you Grace to move on in this journey the devil will throw whatever he wants to throw in them in the middle of the road but did you realize that the Bible says to them that overcome and he says that in every generation which means in every generation it is and there were many excuses of those who did not overcome [Music] in our generation it was very difficult in this area but you see in every age despite those things that discourage there shall be those who shall overcome it and so whenever a morning comes and you are finding yourself in your Christian Journey still walking in this journey you will unovercome [Music] and so God bless you overcome us amen and may we continue to overcome every day foreign [Music] [Music] second Peter 1 12. um I'd like you to remember brother shame in prayers [Music] the people there they actually they had I forgot to tell you on Sunday but they had their first service last last Saturday and they told me that it was attended by 16 students and he told me what he preached to them it was a very good subject and so in that meeting they agreed to me twice uh actually some one of them was suggesting every evening but they agreed that they will be meeting twice a week and by God is Grace I'm planning to be taking the second day [Music] I don't know what they agreed on maybe uh Friday and Saturday or Wednesday and Saturday Thursday and Saturday [Music] so I'll be going there every Saturday and we'll share the message with those students I think that is a very good way for this message to go into the aviation industry really I believe that each of us which we can penetrate that area with this message [Music] if indeed you are truly burdened for this truth you want everyone to hear the message you want everyone to go to heaven so I mean you might be a student somewhere you might be going to work somewhere whatever you are doing please remember the Lord amen so we are reading verses 12. I hope everybody's there now wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth tonight amen amen maybe seated so my subject to you this evening it's part two of what I shared with you last Wednesday how many remember what I shared on on Wednesdays [Music] what was that the message of the hour and so I usually speak for one hour on Wednesday and I'm asking for your undivided attention as we try to see what the Lord has for us tonight so Peter here writes and talks about what he calls the present truth it is impossible for there to be more than one truth in a generation um there has never been more than one truth there is always been one truth and when Jesus came on Earth he said I am the way I am the truth [Music] he did not say I am a truth but he said I am the truth meaning outside of me you cannot find truth there is no truth anywhere else actually Jesus said that all the others that came before me yes they were thieves and robots I am lowly and meek [Music] there is only one truth and that truth will be the same in every generation it can never change it can never change its forms they will always remain the same time will change seasons will change but the truth will always remain the same people even change the people that are on Earth today exactly in one thousand years if the lottery you will not have any of them on this Earth foreign [Music] there are very many of those you find there were many preachers you find there are many uh uh uh prophets for example the book of Acts of the Apostles it was written by a thick Luke he was a doctor I believe those are himself and and and and other books written by other people although there were others who did not know how to write and others who did not even know how to read but God through them he gave his word and when God gives his work in the book of Timothy he says all scripture is given by inspiration of God and he says [Music] the one who came with the with the idea that he met Angels they gave him a book which he called the the the third Testament and he says the Bible is true like a Bible in truth but God gave him a sad Testament in addition to the Bible and there is a big denomination but it is in addition to the Bible you find Muhammad Muhammad he said that what he had he was given to him by administration of angels Mountain there in the Middle East and it's spoken that the Quran is Holy because the Quran has holy scriptures which came by the administration of angels and you have many other books there is a this other book I forgotten its name there's several other books that are considered to be holy books and many people believe in them in the world but all those books came after the Bible there is no book there is no Revelation there is no inspiration that will be more than the Bible that will be true we've got that which we have received are you following me I'm a preacher so I'm preaching this to you but really I'm teaching sometimes I think I said to myself let me just go and be a quiet teacher and I teach this thing really well and I fail because I'm meant difference now I wanted to look at Galatians praise the name of the Lord I want to bring perspective to you regarding this message [Music] verses six I mother that ye are soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ and to another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ so in other words when Paul writes to the Galatians he's telling them something very important he's saying that I'm so surprised when you came to the knowledge of the grace of Christ through the gospelmatic research but that you've been called into another gospel now you'll be removed from this goes and he went to another gospel all these others have been telling you are also gospels all these other books are gospels but then he says it is not another gospel but there are some that trouble you and pervert the gospel of Christ the meaning all this other so-called gospels all these new traditions and ideas it is not another gospel the Quran is not another gospel Quran John Smith is Mormon preaching is on another gospel John Smith says oh there is even a Christian Science there are many there are many more now why do you mean it's not entirely something new and in trivia but what is it it is a perversion of the true gospel there have been those that have made big denominations and there have been those that have come and preached privately and they said God sent them but when we see what they are preaching it is not Bible best it is not founded in the scriptures that is how we are able to know that is the perversion of the truth and it is not the original foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] remember I'm talking about the message [Music] people are something new with what we have seen in the Scriptures it cannot be something different from what was given in the beginning it cannot be a new revelation more than what is in the Bible if it is but I want to tell you this is he doesn't come with a new message he comes with the message listen to what I said the message foreign Hebrews 13 8 says Jesus Christ yes Christo is the same Yom help me finish it yesterday Joe and today and forever what is he trying to say the truth is the same yesterday John today and forever the truth can never change the truth will always be the same that's why when William Burnham came he said I preached what Paul preached [Music] the message is not a new truth though same truth which the apostles but what our religions have done they have perverted that truth foreign but today you know the theologians they look into that Truth uh this one is no longer working let us change the place where it says talking is talking about the deacons wives for them they said let us write let us not read another Bible let us not do another Bible people will realize let us do another version like a Bible yes and then in our version Let Us remove a few scriptures to suit our teachings you know even the homosexuals have made a new Bible did you know the Bible which supports them but in a Bible yeah just the same way the women preachers made themselves just the same with those who don't believe in the Holy Ghost also made their own Bible versions foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] back again thing this message is not a new idea that's why I keep telling you it's not a new church and we who received it we are still contending for it now hallelujah amen the Bible says content for that Faith which was first given to the Saints we are contending for it by believing it but when we do to the people who have been perverted they think we are wrong but we are not wrong we have the present truth that's the message when brother came the prophet of Our Generation he came with a message of restoration as foundations Mommy of the Apostles to me never not be hallelujah hallelujah so it's not a new idea was the scene TV they are the ones with a new idea it's not a new idea and I ask you a question now can there be more than one truth what's up now we cannot say this is everybody going to the Rapture should be in our church the things I'm speaking are very important just to understand what we believe the message cannot be denominated if the message for example was like the uh Seventh-Day Adventists [Music] what does it mean it means for you to go to heaven you must join that nomination you Rapture the members of that denomination that denomination but what did God decide to do he said my truth will remain I am going to send someone who is completely I'm going this message has been sent to all the nominations one way to another [Music] what do you tell them remember in 10 words 20. in a day you have with them I've been spoken to them about Jesus Christ if you haven't I doubt that you are convinced you may be on the road but if you're convinced if you're fully convinced you are going to be concerned foreign are you not so happy to know that you are not members of this church but you are members of the body of Jesus Christ remember and how do you become a member of the body I believe in Jesus as your personal Savior and by being baptized in much water and then he fills you with the Holy Ghost that one makes you a member of the body of Jesus Christ he will burn out those flesh he desires he will take you away from the world she will separate you from the world she will put you in love with him you will be reading the Bible you have been praying you'll be going to church foreign it's not just another religion if it's another religion I better leave it because it's just a wastage of time we are not here to build another one man's Kingdom I feel sorry for people who uh uh you know try to build Kingdoms in the message cannot build kingdoms the kingdom of God and it only starts with a message with the truth with the word so I read for you last time this quote I failed to read it again not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me again oh join my church so even you people who go to preach on the streets what is the target every one that goes to so to do what they call witnessing I'm going to bring church members [Music] isn't it [Music] so that they can build their Kingdom but let me tell you the True Blood of Jesus Christ is not going to do it that way yet again why do we evangelize why do we preach to the Lord we have only one purpose it's not for them to join our church that is nothing you can join my church and still not go to the Rapture sovereign [Music] [Music] if they join our church it should only be for the purpose of them being continuing on on that road path of being encouraged to pursue that is I I even wonder let us not just be church members let us be people here who have a purpose you know why we are here we are not here to field the church I don't care whether I'm preaching to two people or 100 people what I care about is the people who have a burden and a desire to go to the Rapture [Music] if I have five of them oh I'm very satisfied but I know they are not only five in this city they're more than a hundred they're more than 200 but you can foreign Hallelujah man someone was telling me last Sunday Sunday I don't remember he was saying about just instruments they have drums I think they are supported by whites I just smiled I said to you none of all those things I've been purchased by anyone outside foreign but I'm trying to encourage you don't let your motive don't let your attitude don't let yourself we are not here for money because we have the truth to the generation are you hearing me chat you young men you ought to be on fire we all ought to be on fire whenever you have free time use it to preach somewhere give some trucks somewhere be on fire be moved by the Holy Ghost when you meet with your brothers get into the message to our generation you see when you talk about Abram we're gonna quit blame Abraham at his time he was the only reason Hallelujah man that God did not destroy them he had already sent down the angels to go and destroy the city foreign but in that interchange Abraham delayed God yes Hallelujah amen it was because of the abundance Abraham is the type of the Bride I believe somebody's still out there we have to have Vision as a church [Music] okay what about this number what about this number all the way down and they said okay okay I have there my cousins oh we want to know them foreign three God is generous three main goddess generals to the evangelicals William Branham William Branham to the bride now the other two what did their message do God had a multitude what happened when they were gathered [Music] people like all robots Ministries Mighty Miracles friends and wonders and the many after his ministry today what happens when they did those things people's eyes were blind ziba it's just like if they pop today performed one Miracle yeah Catholicism saying that they're following the message no God is here Among Us it will blind them and this is what has happened in our generation what did he do because he called the new name of Abraham you've got the new name of Sarah and what did he do there right there and then they had their body chains because of these angels let me tell you we do in our generation we have received an end-time message an angel means a messenger with a message but this message has come with one Papa bring forth our body change one of these days we are going to change our bodies that is what the Rapture is Amen to prepare us for the coming of the Lord amen present truth this is not a new thing seeming to repeat has happened before but friends if we are going to be the answer of Abraham let me ask you Abraham was a type of the bride and if we are the bride today what are we doing with the lost souls do we have anybody at all foreign [Music] but Abraham had a promise before marriage and out of that a very huge generation he was waiting so we are also waiting we have a promise from God the promise of the Rapture so we are waiting but while we are waiting God sends a message God sends a message to fulfill our promise but not too many have paid attention when Abraham received that message he is you know he was like all over the house everything had to come after yeah my personal ideas the only thing I want to know about it is my messenger and I want to know the message because this is the message of my house foreign so he said I'm not making a church some fellowship organizations [Music] I have never done that and I will never do that I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and the people [Music] if I can accomplish just I would be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men is [Music] listen this one thing a chicken to establish a true spiritual relationship between God and man where men become nucleation Creations filled with his spirit and live according to the world so if you don't have the Holy Ghost you are not a part of those that have attained his purpose let me tell you if you don't have the Holy Spirit you need to know and you asked the Lord will fill you anytime for any time from now Rapture if you don't have the Holy Spirit you will be left behind I'm telling you the truth you must be sure that you are full okay don't just come to church for the sake of something completely one of our associations we're not here for associations to get a relationship with you whatever we do that is when we invite youth conferences that is free services in the week that is if we learn to pray that is to get a relationship with God to be filled with the holy spirit amen the theme but I'm ending the service tonight Genesis chapter 6 verse 13 with Genesis chapter 6 and verses 13. and God said unto Noah the end of All Flesh has come before me for the Earth is filled with violence through them and be behold I will destroy them with the Earth make thee an arc of gopher wood rooms shall thou make in the ark and Shout preach it with within and without with Peach and this is the fashion which Thou shalt make it off the length of the ACT shall be 300 qubits the breadth of the Ark 50 qubits and the height of its uh of it 30 cubits a window shall thou make to the ark and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above and the door of the Ark shalt thou set in the side thereof with lower second and third stories shall thou make it and I be and behold I even I do bring a flood of waters upon the Earth To Destroy All Flesh water in is the Breath of Life from under heaven and everything that is in the Earth shall die but with thee will I establish my Covenant and thou shalt come into the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy son his wives with thee and over and of every living thing of All Flesh two of every thought shalt thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shall make they shall be male and female or false after they are kind and of Qatar after they are kind and of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind two of every thought shall come unto thee to keep them alive and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten and thou shalt gather it to thee and shall be for food for thee and for them thus did Noah according to all that God commanded him so did he I see you've been reading now I want you to see that Noah had Specific Instructions this was not a usual Arc Ade was an arc with the instructions from God foreign no I was only nowhere the voice of God instructed him and told him how the ACT should be [Music] the type of wood type of Windows and everything but he come God had told him how it should be and why did God tell him to do this because God was telling Noah to prepare people because it was going to rain [Music] so what was the message of the hour at that time it is going to rain that was the message one of the reasons why is because it had never happened before but with God there is no new thing under the Earth to God this was not true because it was out of the mouth of God it wasn't new because it was out of the mouth of God but it was true whatever God speaks is true there was no proof at the time that it could happen but building the ark was the only provided way in that day yeah and I want to say in every generation God has a provided he sends them the message that is very far away from their reality now the things that the Bible says and real real woman says but because we tell you brother says can I tell you today it is it has nothing to do with William Brothers [Music] I've discussed this with some of you where he said under no circumstances that is not here everything could be backed up by the Bible yes in the Old Testament and in the New Testament the Bible is very clear when it comes to marriages followers Believers in God always in the Old Testament it was in a shadow it wasn't a type because we know that Israel was natural but for us we Are Spiritual Church Abraham called his servant Ibrahim and told him that my son Isaac will not marry from these women did you hear that nature foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign is there some way if we follow the same way the same condition that somebody else we need the same conditions God will do the same thing that he did for them oh if he doesn't do it he did a mistake foreign I'm like so and so in the Bible I don't have a child of my own and yet I'm married now let me go to church and pray come and pray and pray and then you say God I've made the same condition and you take that from your heart and you say I've met the same condition now if God doesn't give you a child like he gave to Hannah either you've not met the same condition oh God does God do mistakes is he the same he will do the same thing over and over he will never get gifted because of the same God make the conditions and then see if God will not do the same thing that's the good thing about our God by the way let me tell you church as I'm finishing our God is very predictable cartoon very predictive there are some people you work with you don't know what they will do next there's some people you can be with in life and you know for them they always have surprises so you will not know what he will do next if he has done this it means this is happening foreign read character after character all those people who got married [Music] the conditions because the master of does not change it's always been and it will always be the same message because it's the present truth I cannot say that I've really gone into the teachings but like I say this is just the beginning I I trust that God will help us to get deeper and deeper into the subject and see of course as much as he wants you to get you will get let us stand on our feet Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord I'd like us to first prayer do you have any need that you'd like to bring before the Lord [Music] let us ask him Lord Jesus look at my ears we want to come before you this evening father this has been a little broken down message tonight but Lord you can be able to put the pieces together and give your children exactly what they designed the few words that have been spoken along your spirit and them will be able to follow that um and make it a reality into their hearts father Lord you know that the only purpose I also have because the only reason that I have to stand behind this sacred death Clause is that your people shall have a relationship with you [Music] they receive the spirit of God in the image of Jesus Christ that when you come Lord at that day yeah we shall be found ready and let your spirit have you out of your way Lord in our Ministries in Jesus name amen I mean can you switch can you switch just a little bit yes all right I'd like us to sing Jesus I'll never forget what you've done for me [Music] amen Jesus I'll never forget what you've done for me will Jesus I never forget can you switch
