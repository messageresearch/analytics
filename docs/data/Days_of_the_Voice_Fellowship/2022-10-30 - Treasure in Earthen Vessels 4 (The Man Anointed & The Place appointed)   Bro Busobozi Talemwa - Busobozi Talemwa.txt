[Music] and they stood every man in his place round about the calm and all the horse trained and cried and fled foreign foreign uh keep his treasures in a vessel of um of of of metal or in a vessel of something like like aluminum or something like that yeah because his confidence is not in the first so where he is keeping the treasure but his confidence is in the Treasure itself so The Treasure of God is not the flesh your flesh The Treasure of God is what he has deposited and what he has deposited in you is the word of God of God is a light that is shining in your life and the more it shines it goes on growing bigger and bigger and bigger the more you hear but the more light just strikes you don't come away it becomes bigger and bigger and you know that when the light strikes there is one thing that happened without Darkness please Darkness and Light cannot be in the same place at the same time when when life comes Darkness please rather God said in the beginning and I want to say that when we hear the word of God in our life praise the name of the Lord amen so you have to get out what is out of me this morning by saying amen about me now you helped me preach this morning so we can see what the Holy Spirit has for us now whenever God sends a light Captain there is a man anointed to received there is a place what I'm saying is you have your place in the body of Christ and that blessed Rich virtue cannot be replaced by another woman allow you to cheat them you know people sometimes around why do we have a lot of fights and a lot of battles because people are afraid of others taking their presence will replace them before and that's why they keep fighting one another one you know you find that if a Man Loves a Woman especially in Africa here where we have polygamy you find that uh you know a man has more than one woman and you know polygamy is almost legally accepted in our country so you will find that all these women will be fighting for their place in the heart and in the same way even when a man is married [Music] [Applause] that he can repress me foreign and there is a place anointed our place appointed I told which for God to bless you he wants to bless you there nobody can use you so that he can anoint you come after and use you in my dreams praise the name of the Lord I want to look at verse Psalms 105 13. when they went from one nation to another from one Kingdom to another he suffered no man to do them wrong yeah he reproved the Kings for their sex saying that's not my anointed and do my prophets know how is that too foreign 105 13. 105 13 yes praise the name of the Lord anointed foreign a little bit I'm so glad that I can say foreign is Anointed God never wants his prophets amen you notice in the Bible there was a Man Called Moses and Moses had given one of the laws no Israelite was supposed to marry out of Israelites Moses went and married an Ethiopian and he was supposed to be the prophet of God and when his sister and the other prophets and other brothers oh God he said who are you to do that how come you do that and and you know the sister of Moses became sick and and and you know they could not get any remedies unless the man of God prayed and we've seen that over and over you know even at one place one of the men of God lied and you know this man took the woman in his in the Integrity of his heart without knowing what happened he was going to kill the kids he said how can you take the wife of my Prophet how dare you do that and he said now restore the man his wife and we find it over and over in scripture Elisha was walking on the road you know these little children who were not taught well by their parents and they came scorning and laughing maybe they were laughing at his boat children can be on the villages come on and when he saw them that was not right why because he was a man anointed and he was in his right place let me tell you if you were a child of God you know you know he was signing all these papers which were declaring him as a king and giving middle authorities but maybe he was frustrated you know he was just on the table Yeah he was you know signaling some of his people to come on the creek so these people went on the news they put it all over you know you know I think is this I think I mean this is a human being because he is on yourself foreign sometimes you can even reach a moment yeah the Son of God when you are not going to pray but you just think and things will happen amen it's in your mind we need to recognize our places then you come to that realization that God is not going to give you breakthroughs because of your abilities and and really this subject that I'm speaking on is something about our day today living um defeated lives because of what we think of ourselves you know you always think law of yourself because people can't even stop God because they think a lot of themselves and let us follow this thought through category let us look at uh Judges 7 1. of Herod so that the horse of the midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of Murray in the valley and the Lord said unto Gideon the people that are with thee are two family for me to give the midianites into their hands lest Israel want themselves against me saying mine owner understand and accept me Nicola maybe it wasn't the place appointed Charlie she said and they were not yet anointed so here Israel is rifling at the hand of the midianites for years and the end of the Lord came one day and he said let me tell you sometimes God but sometimes it doesn't get to do it cause of the place where we are already poetry because if he does it at that place you will think it was your own strength you will think it was your own energy it was your ability and now God blesses you in a place it is at the place of weakness that God wants to anoint that much raise the name of the Lord and so we see here that these people 32 everyone around the Middle East were always fighting against us they are very many actually there were 22 000 people he said God these people are so many countries for me to give the immediates into their house the moment you think that you were so holy foreign the moment you think we can throw the words you are so rich God Will Make sure you do not attain your goals the moment you think we cast all the words you have accumulated a lot of wisdom and knowledge and if you read this Bible very well it has happened over and over again God always confounds the wisdom of the wives am I preaching to someone God always confounds the wisdom of the world and here he told Gideon thank you for the amen those people sought for two minutes God is not in big crowds have you ever thought about that God is never in a big problem wait a moment those five thousand were there for as long as they prayed and the fish was dead but even when the fish and the bread was there now you want the middle name they could not stand the word when Jesus began to open the Scrolls yes we are single room is single they said these things are so hard for us how can he tell us and the Bible says the end shall not come until there is a falling away fast so don't fear if you hear some who said they have left a message that has to happen foreign [Applause] hallelujah amen those who hate me they go again and those who love me and they don't love me because they love me but I love me because they love the world those are the ones amen and every Pastor that preaches the word that conviction you know you don't want people to love you because you're a superstar foreign Jesus yes remained only with a few yes one of them was still uh the Devil Himself Jesus Christ the same yesterday where he is today there will be a repeat of this your arm is so big please let me tell you we don't cut down our army by chasing our people um by giving people wrong and bad attitude foreign let him return and depart Ali from the ma from Mount Gilead and their returned of the people 20 and 2000 and there remain ten thousand foreign [Music] that's why you sit in churches every Church but people will keep coming whatever and people will keep going again and then you ask yourself who chased them and who kept those ones who stayed at any time I think we have something wrong people who love to do that you know make you know puts them in that kind of uh spiral oh I think there's something wrong you know maybe our music has a problem maybe what we are preaching let me tell you these things could all be true but the true seed of God will always true is this in where that is being preached and here 22 000 people left again and over the years that I've been preaching this message but I've noticed that and you know God has also allowed me to be in the beginning assemblies I've never in all my life uh uh been or attended uh a mega church I've preached to some of them but on occasions all my life I've dealt with small groups but you know you watch a church grow from 50 people by the time you get 10 people you have in and out you have had about 50 people um and all those take a piece of your life as a minister you pray with each of them preach to them you pray with them and only for them to leave again foreign foreign [Music] hallelujah amen there is always a chance until the chance is not there voila what did you say wow let me tell you that the very last person that was saved when Jesus was on earth oh I should say the very first one when Jesus died on the cross yesterday he died on the very last minute it was seven in the last of the last minute imagine there were many people who were in Paradise for years and years and years and they were all waiting foreign my brother died with Jesus foreign what if he was sad I don't even want to preach anymore how can the father let me suffer like this how can I go through this because I'm hungry that Soul would have been lost even at that better moment let me just said hey true these were two thieves that one of them um [Music] save yourself so they're all the same you're all going to be is you never say that there you'll get it but Jesus he was full of grace and full of Truth oh Hallelujah some Believers are so full of truth that they have no Grace at all right okay Jesus was full of grace and truth he saw this man I did not comments because Jesus was full of grace this man was touched and he said to the other man like that about the man who has died for no reason foreign at least for us we have done what we have been killed for what could it says [Applause] my Lord when you die and you get there please there are many Souls what God remembers you will be in Paradise With Me hallelujah amen in less than 24 hours don't you love the message hallelujah amen and Jesus amen don't you think you're a holy brother hello words I think some people have had a wrong approach to this message that they attend or believe the message they are better than others into the kingdom of God hahaha Gideon okay you had so much hey man where is Isaac to recruitment hallelujah amen you know Isaac is in recruitment you know he went out yeah hallelujah amen and you know what oh my name he was so much you will think it was by yourself amen sometimes you say God when he serves us God will allow you to be weakness sometimes [Music] amen that's how you are watch your body I'm going to use you I want to use you Hallelujah without your weakness yes yes with all your insufficience that's why you have all those weaknesses and then at the end of the day and then the Army becomes very small the Lesser you become the more happy God is the money praise the Lord come and give us the way and so we go to verse 4. tell all the fearful to go away to go away and how many people left why do people sometimes leave the message how can I leave a Christian Life as a younger man how can I live without fornication how can I live without cheating how can I live when I am baby How can I live like that um they are afraid but yeah because they think they can do it the plastic is so great that's when God says so I ask you are you afraid easy okay [Music] easy is not in yourself it is in the light it is you know I always sing that song Victory belongs to Jesus Victory belongs who can stand against [Music] me you see it's not who can stand against me the victory belongs to me many people have a lot of eye eye that means they did nothing effect [Music] without you water it God can accomplish Allah praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen Without You Without You when they're 2 000 people EE we have a a a proverb in Uganda which says those that are together they can bite the meat foreign God looks at the weakness and the ability to accept that weakness if you can accept your weakness you can accept history and so they remained only 20 only 10 000. as if that is not enough foreign the people are yet too many bring them down onto the water and I will try them for thee there and it shall be that of whom I stay unto thee this shall go with thee the same shall go with this unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not understand so he brought down the people onto the water and the Lord everyone set by himself likewise everyone that powers down upon his knees to drink and a number of them that loved putting their head to their mouth where 300 men [Music] but all the rest of the people bow down upon their knees to drink water [Music] and the Lord said unto Gideon by 300 men that loved I will save you know in hand and let all the people the other people go every other man every man unto his place the second phase God told them take these men down to the brook I'm going to tell you what to do praise the Lord now I want you to see what they call elections being elected it's interesting Gideon there was no Gideon's mentality of the challenge there was no gideonic strength was prepared by a god even before the foundations of the world because he told him take these people just to protect I will tell you what is next then they went to the Brooks the church is still Big Ten though even the Cockroaches run away it is beautiful tell your neighbor it is good it is true foreign small weak things Hallelujah man is not the power of your peace wax [Music] foreign [Applause] that's what you said I'm saying it's a matter of time and see hallelujah amen I know I know what I was talking about and I know it was anybody understand it as long as we are preaching the true message is able to take weak men and women make powerful men and women hallelujah amen both spiritually and physically I don't believe in my God make me spiritually powerful and physically and financially very well securities before I say that God I want you to foresee when you see him yes sir people women fear to go up and apply for jobs in big companies foreign I'll give you here something if we are going to be Kings and Priests if we are going to subdue the Earth and manifest the third pool foreign that's why we believe in Divine Healing conditions whatever you will do then he can do nothing if we are talking about the third pool we're talking about we should not push it ahead [Music] yeah it's a good theology yesterday I believe that I also believes that can be here foreign [Applause] and if you can accept that you will serve yourself a lot of problems humble yourself and accept okay to use you for something and ten thousand people which apparently was a very huge Church [Music] fell down 300 people again the 970 are good but the kids that you are an evangelist you know and they believe the message or maybe the past accept it and it presents it to their people remains foreign [Music] so I want to check this thing and take it among a weak things and show the weak things of the world for God to serve the world currency he had to become weakness and that made him like one of them foreign but he was weak I'm ready hope that you're taking something to your house and only 300 remain and these people election how were they chosen it wasn't the pastor saying you leave my church you live now from I don't believe in excommunications I believe people excommunicate foreign Hallelujah man and and how many people left 9700 think about it yes foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] somebody that God of yours is praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah it's not my power let us read let us read Zechariah and I think I'll finish this message on Wednesday so I've not reached my climax I just want to cut it because I'm wearing the Flesh and also I'd like you to get everything fully well so let us read Zechariah 4 6. the answer and speak unto me saying this is the word of the Lord saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith a lot of words [Music] Romans 9 16 so then it is not of him that we will know of him that runeth but of God that's choice I can do it foreign you know that's why we believe this preciousness [Music] we wrote my blood Mercy [Music] rewrote my life and I should have fallen my soul but my sea reward my life think about it oh God [Music] my life [Music] [Music] [Music] lift up your hands if you can sing it once again [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] but Mercy [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] God is not going to save you with your abilities we as Believers need to learn to cast down all our abilities and look at his grace and what he can do for us [Music] foreign [Music] let us look at it as nothing [Music] we should learn how to yield ourselves yield ourselves to his will you dance off to his word and his ways and understand this by Mercy not of him that Weare to run it everybody here that God show his Mercy thank you for your mercy Lord [Music] sure it is by your mercy that we can stand without it
