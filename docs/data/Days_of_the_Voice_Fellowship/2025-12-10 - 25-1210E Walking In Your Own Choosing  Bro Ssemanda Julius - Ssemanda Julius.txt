Your heart. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Jesus [singing] [music] [singing and music] [music] [singing] mighty God. [music] [music] Oh, [music] [singing] see God with me. [music] Oh my [singing] god. I know you. I know you are alive. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; One day when I [singing] was lost, he [music] died upon [singing] the cross. I [music] know it was the love for me. [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know it [music] was the blind. I [singing] know it was the blind [music] for me [music] [singing] when I was lost. [music] He died upon the cross. Oh, it [singing] was [music] a blind for me. [music] If you can just from the sincerity [music] of your heart, I give you 10 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes. just your if you can just from the sincerity of your life, [singing and music] those 10 minutes may be the best moment you have in all [music] the entire service. It may be that God wanted you to just come and have those 10 &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; So you never know. Just talk with him. Talk to him. Lord, I know it was the blood. I just said, Lord, [singing] one day when I was lost, you died. And when the Holy Spirit has come down, he sets me free from all those that had bound. Just like [music] soldiers. Sometimes weary, sometimes broken down, many times wounded, other times discouraged. Many times they get defeated. But they are not left without [music] rise again. [music] Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus, I come to thee. I bless your name and I thank you. I'm just here by your grace, God. just looking at the blood of Jesus Christ your son and I'm saying Lord have mercy upon me. I don't come to have justice for you. I just come pleading for mercy. Just saying Lord come and have your way with me. [singing and music] Take me out of the way and give me the grace to stand &gt;&gt; that you descend down in a special way. in a mighty way to the praise of your grace and your glory. Lord, Lord, that this time may go that only many have been seen standing on the palit [music] [singing] that someone had contact with Jesus. [music] Let it be this hour, Father, that our mind be soaked in you, Father. Tell me that I may tell them. Encourage me, Father. Start with me. &gt;&gt; I have a great need of you. Spiritually, physically, materially, financially, in all things, Lord, we all have deep need of you. &gt;&gt; We have a great desire for you, Lord Jesus. We adore you. Such a great God. Highly magnified, &gt;&gt; full of righteousness. &gt;&gt; You are holy. &gt;&gt; You are great. [music] &gt;&gt; You are mighty. Sanctify us, Father. Draw us nigh and closer to thee. Consecrate us for your service. This is a moment that we have surrendered to you. We are thankful to thee &gt;&gt; because you have brought us here today and therefore we pray. May we not go back the same Lord. May we have a spiritual touch by the hand of God, those that are here, those online, those that will listen after [singing] each one of them have a spac experience with you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; by the hearing of the word. &gt;&gt; Come and change our situations. &gt;&gt; Come and turn the tables around. Come and give us testimonies. Come and hope our unbelief. Give us confidence in all things, Lord. We see your goodness. Humble us before thee. Give us thy wisdom. Oh Lord Jesus, we invite you to come and go with every person here all through this service &gt;&gt; and after it. Dear God, may they never forget the experience that they are going to have. Let it be eternal. Oh father, I surrender to thee now fully, completely and entirely. Take over my tongue. Father, &gt;&gt; may I find favor before your children that they may believe the word and I pray the Lord Jesus Christ. May the glory and honor return back to you in and at the end of the service. I decrease that you may increase in Jesus [music] Christ name I pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; May God richly bless you. &gt;&gt; Thank you for coming to church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think this is my second time being here on a Wednesday, but it is the first time to be in the service. The first one I came when the service is is done. The people are getting out. I greeted them. I got the blessing. This one I'm here because I got a sick leave and I got it today. After the checkup. The checkup showed I'm I'm not I have no fever, but I was not really going through I was I was going through a hard time. But uh daytime I was okay just very but from Saturday uh the night times not okay. That's why it's not good to be alone. [laughter] God said it's not good that a man should be alone. So I I said I'm I thought I'll be fine. It went on and I I couldn't even I didn't want to eat at all until I could feel the body is getting weak. I could force myself to eat just to give the body but no sickness. Then I woke up on Monday. I know Tuesday, yesterday, reached work. All of a sudden people are telling what happened to your face. I said what? Said you have not looked at yourself in the mirror this morning. I said not at all. said, "Uhhuh. No, I didn't say that. [laughter] I have it." Said, &gt;&gt; I said, "Not at all." He said, "You look at your face. I looked and things had just come up. I didn't know why. I took a risk. I went for try to treat myself in my own way. Yeah, but uh I'm I'm better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, dear pastor. &gt;&gt; Glad to have you today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless everyone of you. Amen. Amen. Let's turn to our Bibles. Luke 10. 38-42 Now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus's feet, and he had his word. But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dust thou not care that my sister had left me to serve alone? Bid her therefore that she help me. And Jesus answered and said unto her, Ma, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things, but one thing is needful, and Mary has chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her. Amen. for Amen. You may take your seats. Father in the name of Jesus Christ, put this word together. Speak to the hearts of your people. in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I always desire to be whenever the the the doors are open and God knows my heart but sometimes not possible but one day it will be possible. I still believe God will do it for me. &gt;&gt; Walking in your own choosing is my subject. Walking in your own choosing. Yes. The scripture says, "Now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain village and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. As Jesus was passing by a certain village, the Bible says he entered into a certain village. When he entered that village, a certain woman named Martha received him into a house. When you get to hear THAT JESUS CHRIST HAS ENTERED somewhere or is he passing this way, he's passing that way OR IS HE PASSING YOUR WAY? Receive him. Don't let him pass by. Don't let HIM JUST GO BY. RECEIVE him into your heart. That is into your heart. The prophet says when Jesus, he says, WHEN HE'S IN YOUR HOME, then there is no trouble. But when he LEAVES YOUR HOME, WATCH OUT FOR TROUBLE. BETTER DO ANYTHING THAT WILL KEEP HIM AROUND. BETTER DO WHATEVER YOU CAN THAT WILL ATTRACT him to your house. So when mother heard that Jesus had entered her village, she received him into her house. You may not have a chance and opportunity like ma to receive him in your house in a corporal body. But you can receive him all the time. When the HOLY SPIRIT COME DOWN ON THE DAY of pentecost, he didn't go back. That's why the PROPHET SAYS THERE'S NO MORE SAYING THAT I'M WAITING AND IN THE in the in the in the upper room 30 days or 50 days, WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE. HE ALREADY CAME. YOU CAN RECEIVE HIM NOW. So when you hear that Jesus is passing that way, receive him in your house and she had a sister called Mary which also sat at Jesus's feet and heard his words. SO THIS HOUSE BELONGED to Martha. &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T MARY'S HOUSE. &gt;&gt; It was Martha's house. &gt;&gt; AND THE ONE WHO received Martha. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. The one who received Jesus was mother, not Mary. Listen carefully. But mother was encumbered about much serving since she was the host of the Lord. He had the responsibility to provide FOR THE GUEST BUT THIS WAS NOT A NOMINAL guest like Julius comes you know he's hungry get bread get down there was something different about Jesus the Bible say and he came and he came to him and he Say, Lord, dust thou not care that my sisters left me to serve alone, you have come with many people. You have come with many people. But Mary and this is my house after all. Even Mary is just CHOSEN TO SIT DOWN AT THE FEET OF JESUS to hear his word. AND MOTHER'S DOING ALL THE CHORES alone the house. HE SAYS BID HER there that she help me as if that didn't move Jesus. Jesus answered and said THOU ART CAREFUL AND TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS. It's good to have a LOT OF THINGS TO CARE ABOUT. Don't let them TOO MANY. DON'T let them BE TOO MANY until they be they take you the time. They take the time. They occupy your time not to hear the word UNTIL THEY OCCUPY ALL YOUR TIME. Occupy all your mind. you know that she was trying to serve the Lord but that was THAT IS NOT THAT WAS NOT THE FIRST requirement at that time. It's like you just right now you we have come the service has started then you pick a towel you start cleaning is what you are doing is good but I'm you are confusing the preacher you start to look for toilet paper you taking them to the TOILET IT IS GOOD BUT YOU ARE DOING it at the wrong time. I forgot to give the PUMPER TO THE BABY SERVICE TIME. You would have did that because you don't know a point. It says M careful and troubled about many things, BUT ONE THING IS NEEDED. YOU LOOK AT JESUS WHAT HE SAYS. HE SAYS ONE THING IS NEEDFUL AND Mary has chosen not that I've told her. Mary has chosen that good part her own choosing which shall not be taken away from her. IT WAS A CHOICE THAT SHE MADE. YES, we have a lot to do AT HOME. BUT we need to have the whole family altar. Yes, I have a lot of things TO HANDLE. BUT I NEED TO PRAY. YES, I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO TALK ABOUT. But Jesus, I have to talk about him too. But I have to find a time alone with him. There is a lot of things that is necessary. A LOT OF THINGS THAT IS NEEDED. A LOT OF THINGS THAT'S THE RIGHT TO BE DONE. A lot of THINGS THAT'S YOUR OWN PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. Sometimes and sometimes almost time IT'S YOUR OWN GODGIVEN responsibility but it's a part of your personal walk with the god. It is different from your personal walk with the god. You may have a responsibility GIVEN TO YOU BY GOD, but it's a little bit different FROM THE FROM THE TIME YOUR TIME with God. IT'S A time you choose yourself. It's a walking with Jesus. It's a walking WITH GOD. IT'S A PERSONAL choice we make every day. Let me just have to say this. I love to talk to my fiance at times when I say I've not talked to her. She may talk she might call me at this time. But then I I say now but I want I want to pray at this time. And I'm like, but she might she might call me. If I don't pray, it may not go well. &gt;&gt; I if I lose the time for prayer, I will lose something about her. I may lose her call. I lose her call. But if I do pray, I'll gain more from her. So I choose to pray then I get her later. What am I trying to say? What you get through prayer? You can only keep it by prayer. The choosing of the bride. He says paragraph 31. In many things of life, we are given a choice. The way of life itself is a choice. We have a right to make our own way. Choose our own way that we want to live. You know it says in the time of decision. God doesn't make all your decision. If we have to wait upon God for every move, He says then there is no overcoming on our part. There are many TIMES A PROPHET SAYS GOD WHAT WOULD YOU DO? What would you have done if this was your daughter? God says I'm waiting on you to see what you will do. THERE ARE TIMES HE says God I'm waiting on you. God doesn't make all your decision. He says we have a right to make our own way, CHOOSE OUR OWN WAY THAT WE WANT TO LIVE. education is a choice. WE CAN CHOOSE WHETHER WE ARE GOING TO BE EDUCATED OR WHETHER WE ARE NOT going to be educated. THAT IS A CHOICE THAT WE HAVE. RIGHT. And wrong is a choice. Every man, every woman, boy and girl has to choose whether they are going to live right or not live right. It is a choice. Then he choice is a great thing. Choice is a great thing. your eternal destination is a choice. And maybe tonight, it's good. This message is also in the night. Some of you will make that choice. I passed by those fellows there at some denominational church. Today, this night, your evening, they were teaching children and so forth how to make choices. I felt glad. I said, "Oh, praise God." And we are going to talk about the reality of it. That's the darkness of it. That's not USING THE THEOLOGICAL PART of it. But, we are using the spiritual part of it. YOUR ETERNAL DESTINATION IS A CHOICE. YOU MAKE THAT CHOICE where you will spend eternity service ends. There will be one time that IF YOU TURN GOD DOWN many time. There will BE ONE TIME YOU TURN HIM DOWN. THE LAST time there is a line between mercy and judgment. There is a line between death and life. There is A LINE BETWEEN GRACE and judgment. There is A LINE BETWEEN SORROW AND HAPPINESS. There is a bridge. in every life. And it's a dangerous thing FOR A MAN OR WOMAN, BOY OR GIRL, TO STEP ACROSS THAT LINE. For there is NO RETURN WHEN YOU STEP ACROSS THAT. So tonight, it might be the time that many will make their decision where they will spend the endless eternity. There is another choice that we have in life. That's the life is companion. A young man or a young woman stepping out on life has been given a right to make a choice. The young man chooses the young woman HAS A RIGHT TO ACCEPT OR REJECT IT. Don't say vision sister don't reject. She has a right to reject it. regardless of what you saw, what you feel, what you think, what you believe. But it is STILL A CHOICE OF BOTH SIDES. Both man and woman, they have a right to choice. Also, you have a choice. A Christian, YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF THE CHURCH. That's your own given privilege. We still have it in Uganda, too. CHOOSE ANY CHURCH THAT YOU WANT TO BELONG TO. THAT'S A CHOICE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO ANY OF THEM. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, no one will TAKE YOU TO PRISON, BUT you'll end in a prisons of hell. If you want to change from THE METHODIST TO THE BAPTIST or the Catholic to a Protestant &gt;&gt; SO FORTH, THERE IS NOBODY can tell you or make you come to any certain church. That's our freedom. THAT'S WHAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS. EVERY MAN CAN CHOOSE FOR HIMSELF. Freedom of religion. That's a great thing. God, help us keep it as long as we can. You have [screaming] ALSO A CHOICE. WHEN YOU choose this church, you can choose whether in this church, WHETHER YOU WILL CHOOSE a church that will GUIDE YOU TO YOUR ETERNAL DESTINATION. You can choose a CHURCH THAT HAS A certain creed that you might think that creed is just what you want. Most of the decisions we make are based upon what we want. All the other church has their creator and then there is the word of God. He says no that that one you can choose the church you want to. feel a crit can make you better. He says IF YOU FEEL THAT CRITIC SAY YOU HAVE A FREEDOM TO DO THAT. THERE ARE NO CERTAIN WORDS WE WANT TO USE TO PERSUADE ANY MAN. But we want every MAN AND WOMAN to have a godgiven conviction. NO MATTER HOW HARD IT CAN GET TO THEM, we still want TO THEM TO MAKE A CHOICE. WHETHER WHEN IT GETS HARD, THEY WILL STILL COME OR they will it's still they still we want to still have that freedom. WE DON'T WANT TO DEPRIVE you of that because we want to see which decision you make. And then there is the word of God have choice of YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. He says [snorts] there is an unwritten law among US of choosing. I do not read where he was invited. &gt;&gt; Sorry. At one time Martha invited him and Mary was Lazarus was dead. BUT AT THIS POINT, it wasn't said that they invited him, BUT HE JUST ENTERED INTO THAT village and they received him. But he didn't give them a choice. He didn't choose for them. Mother come get over here. There is an unwritten law among us of choosing. Listen my brother, MY SISTER. YOU JUST CAN'T STAND ON TWO GROUND. YOU HAVE GOT TO CHOOSE ONE FOR THE OTHER. LOOK, YOU COME TO A POINT WHERE YOU ARE IN A STRAIGHT HELD BETWEEN TWO OPINIONS. It may be for a just cause. You don't know WHICH WAY TO GO FOR THE LORD. LIKE PAUL in Philippians CHAPTER ONE, HE SAID, "I AM BETW TO go and be with the Lord ought to remain and preach the gospel. If I go and be with THE LORD, IT WORKS GOOD FOR ME. But if I remain I really s I don't know which way but you can be in between when you don't know whether to choose God or the devil YOU CAN'T CONTINUE HAVING TWO OPINIONS or being doubleminded when it comes to make a choice. is a decision. If you don't decide, still you have decided and that is the worst decision you will ever make. YOU CAN'T CONTINUE HAVING TWO opinion for a doubleminded person. In James 1:8 IS unstable in all his ways. All of his ways. GET THE MAN IS SO DOUBLE MINDED. It will BE SO UNSTABLE IN all his ways. Yes, sister. He says a sister not long ago. She had two brothers wanted to marry her and she could not make a DECISION WHO TO MARRY TO GET married and they both left her. He says better not take it too long. THERE WILL BE A TIME WHERE YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION. Elijah says in first Kings 18:21, how long will you hold between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him. BUT IF be God, follow him. He came to this age. You know the spirits don't die. They just change the master. WHEN HE CAME TO THE EDGE, HE SAID UNTO THE EDGE of it's held up in INDECISION NOT COLD AND WARM HOT CHOICE. That was the condition of IT SAYS BECAUSE THOU art not hot. not spit this way, this way. &gt;&gt; No, not making a choice. &gt;&gt; That was the trouble of the age. Take note, we are still living in the but we are called out of you know be living in this world but we are not of this world. We can OPERATE though not with physical eyes. Brother, THERE ARE A TIME WHEN YOU are held between such circumstances. In the book OF JORAH 3 SAYS 14, THERE ARE MULTITUDES [screaming] in the valley of decision. multitudes in the VALLEY OF DECISION. I WANT TO TAKE THAT SCRIPTURE IN THIS DIRECTION. THERE IS MULTITUDES OF PEOPLE HELD UP IN MAKING BROTHER. YOU SAY BROTHER I JUST CAN'T SEE IT. BUT I'M TELLING YOU THIS EVENING, YOU ARE HELD UP somewhere because God God will never bring a message if it is useless. You are HELD UP SOMEWHERE BUT YOU YOU HAVE GOD REQUIRES YOU TODAY to he says take a decision. I want to let me tell you something. It's not good not to make a decision. And it's not good to rush into choices. And it's not good TO TAKE TOO LONG. AND IT'S NOT good to be afraid to make a decision. LISTEN, YOU MIGHT TAKE ON SOMETHING that you can you you can make A DECISION AND TAKE ON SOMETHING that you can't shake out of. But be warned, you may NOT MAKE A DECISION OR REMAIN IN SOMETHING THAT YOU WON'T SHAKE out of. Listen now. He says if you have prayed before you MAKE THE DECISION AND YOU PRAY then you make a decision whether it's WRONG OR IT'S RIGHT IT WILL COME OUT RIGHT WHEN I PRAY AND I JUST SAID GOD I TOLD YOU THIS I PRAYED NOW I'VE MADE A DECISION NOW IT'S UP TO HIM. If it's right, it's right. He will bring it out right. GOD WANTS A MAN TO MAKE A DECISION REGARDLESS. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR NOT making a decision. A man might WAIT TOO LONG AFTER HE HAS RECEIVED THE CALL OF GOD. I WANT TO MAKE YOU TO TO assure you today. Just make your decision. &gt;&gt; It's not pride. It's not pride to feel the call of God. It's a call. You make a decision. YOU GET SOMETIMES IN A TIME IN A TIGHT PLACE. The prophet says, "Be sure you make the right decision. Put God in everything." Sometimes he says, "Then after I prayed, see which way, see which way your heart leads." Amen. I know the heart is over a wicked but NO IT'S BEEN SURRENDERED TO GOD. LISTEN BROTHER THOUGH WE ARE MEN AND HUMAN BEINGS. BUT SINCE WE ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF God we are LED BY THE SPIRIT. THE DECISIONS WE MAKE, GOD MAKES THEM ALL COME OUT. Doesn't matter which way. HE ALL GETS TO THAT FINAL GOAL. I have a friend in Jesus that takes care OF SOMETHING. THERE ARE TIMES when you are warned. When you are warned, don't make certain decisions. And God will warn you brother. God will warn your sister not to warn such to make certain decisions, certain choices. Don't silence that voice. Just ask God why. There's something in here, something within my heart and it is this and that. What difference does it make? If you keep anything and you say this one even I don't feel like telling it to God. He knows it already. ONE DAY STANDING IN THE PRESENCE of that being says the prophet. HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE of God. And God told him, "Go and tell them their thoughts are allowed in heaven than they are. Just all those thoughts, God says they are too loud than your own words. here today. You do your OWN CHOOSING, but God will always warn you of the choices that you are going to make. But because OF THE FREE MORAL AGES, you you you choose to do it anyhow. But when God has warned you ABOUT IT, YOU START DOING IT ANYHOW AND YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT IT IS WRONG. But you choose to do it, then you can't blame God because God respects your choice. Whether I reject his whether I reject his word, whether I reject him, he respects your choice. [snorts] God says my spirit shall not sit with man. He respects the choice you make WHETHER YOU ACCEPT HIS WORD. WHEN YOU ACCEPT HIM, YOU ACCEPT HIS WORD, he respects it. HE RESPECTS YOUR CHOICE, BUT WILL ALWAYS WARN YOU OF THE CONSEQUENCES of your choice. They told Samuel, "Give us a king like the rest of the king, the rest of the nation that we may be like the rest of them and say, "OH, BUT BUT GOD HAS BEEN YOUR KING all through." No, we need another leadership. WE NEED ANOTHER GUY. GOD HAS BEEN YOUR GUIDE AUTHOR. He says it's all right. It's not they have not rejected rejected you somewhere. They have rejected me. But go and tell them this is the manner of the king. They shall such and such and such and such and such and such and such. And he came and he told them when you ask for the king when you get the king this and this and that and that and that will happen. Nevertheless, we want a KING WHO SET THEIR MIND UPON SOMETHING. It's hard to turn there. But I want to say UNTO YOU, ALWAYS PUT AN ALLOWANCE IN YOUR HEART, AN allowance in your mind of collection. I don't know that the microphone was scared. She made a decision to give way. [laughter] &gt;&gt; So what am I saying here? It's that uh they they they were making a wrong decision and God warned them of that decision, the consequences of it. But they still wanted the king. God respected their choosing. God is so respectful. He is so humble. [laughter] Job says, "God is so great, but he despises no man. I wonder for us we despise men and he says God despises myself I despise myself but he doesn't despise he respected their choice and again I want to say respect each other's choosing I remember one time now it may be a right choice and you want them to do something else. They may be your children you want them to study something. I I remember when I wanted to study, I I I went I chose a course in water engineering and I brought back that advert whatever paper, one of my guardians. Uh it was brother Michael and I gave him that. You know, I I was really so confused. I used to come to him. I tell him I'm going to do me theology. And he tells me, "Oh, wow. Fine." He he could respect him. I come back again. I tell her, "I think I do this." And says, "Oh, I'll fail." And I was like then I came to I told him I'm going to do auto and he looked at it and said why not civil engineering I said what is civil engineering because I didn't know I didn't want engineering I had not thought about he said all right you do what I I just respected my children. But I loved it. What am I SAYING? WHETHER PEOPLE ARE WRONG or right, respect their children. If they are wrong, they'll remember the words of God. If they are right, they'll rejoice at you. walking in your OWN CHOOSING. YOU JUST CAN'T LET SOMEONE MAKE A CHOICE FOR you because if something COMES UP, YOU WILL say they chose it for we don't want to choose for you. Fall into your things. Fall into your things alone. But make sure you make the right decision. Ask counsel and guidance that you may make the right decision. It says many time men and women. Hear God's word. Uh that's in paragraph 43. And see it vindicated and proven to be the truth. YET THEY DON'T WANT to hear it. I PRAY THEE, HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT JUST MAN. I SUFFERED MANY THINGS OF him in the tree. That's the wife of Pilate. I suffered many things of him in the tree. Have nothing to do with the Jesus of this man. This man thought that washing his hands can make him guiltless. Well, THAT MAKES NO MAN GUILTLESS. IT IS THE FAITH IN THE BLOOD OF JESUS, WASHING YOURSELF AND CLEANING YOURSELF AND MAKING SURE YOU are clean after committing SIN. IT DOES NOT MAKE YOU CLEAN. Just on Sunday I was just in my heart saying Lord oh just have mer upon your servant and I was just there waiting upon the tax on the road just having a selfexamination and you know I was just thinking about the Lord just praying within my heart but then I happened to look at This man these men who stand by the road there they eat sugar cane there those guys there they drop those things there then in the trench then after these men get a broom those same men they get a broom they start to sweep They sweep these things into the trench. Now I go. I looked. I said, "Lord, what do you want me to learn from this?" Then I thought, "Is this man doing any good?" I said, "No." Well, he's cleaning where he's standing, where he waits upon, but he's spoiling the trench. Then I thought, it's all right for you when you ask for forgiveness from the Lord after doing wrong, but there is a life you have spoiled. I thought, oh, that's true. There are many times the Lord can forgive you. You have been cleansed. He washes you. But there is someone. So you is still polluted. Their mind was polluted. I thought Yeah. We do that many times. Then I thought, don't be selfish with your salvation. I believe that was God telling you, don't be selfish with your salvation. You are caring too much about your soul. But you don't know &gt;&gt; though you it's well now but someone saw you and thinks it's all right. He says I I'm sorry I've went off the notes but that's how God works. Many hear God's truth. They see it vindicated and but they don't WANT TO HEAR IT. Pilate refused and he say okay. He took the he thought now I'm free of the decision what she has told me I'm not going to choose I'm not going to make any decision that was the worst decision he MADE LET ME PASS ON THE DECISION TO THE CONGREGATION HE SAYS ALL RIGHT CHOOSE YOU BETWEEN Jesus myself. I'm not going to choose. &gt;&gt; What? It's It's the worst thing. OKAY. CHOOSE you and they chose Barabas and they reaped. But it was still a choice. God gave them to make. However vindicated, whatever it was, IT WAS A choice for the thieves on the cross, either to choose Christ or to choose to blasphe with the priests. But Jesus was vindicated. THERE IS SOME OTHER REASON. There is SOME OTHER CHOOSING. THAT THEY HAVE THAN TO FACE UP TO THE truth and facts. Therefore, their ears can be close to the gospel. They will never hear it again. I adise TO YOU. GOD SPEAKS TO your heart. You act right there, brother. It is still a choice. There will come no day. There will come no time, not no moment that God will take that liberty away from you. He will keep it that way. Remember brother, sister, your choice, the prophet teaches us will reflect your ambition and your character. So it is not for us to ask I wonder what is Julius's ambition. Just watch. PASTOR PREACHED TO US A MESSAGE THAT THE word matures the seed. I didn't I had never thought about that all my life that the word matures the weed and the tears the seed and the tears. Hallelujah. I saw THIS IS THE TRUTH OF IT. NOW LISTEN BROTHER, IT'S YOUR CHOICE WILL AFFECT YOUR MISSION AND YOUR CHARACTER. What you choose shows what truly is in you. NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY ON THIS SIDE. YOUR CHOICES SHOWS WHICH SIDE YOU ARE. I AM MADE OF THIS. YOUR CHOICES SHOWS WHAT TRULY YOU ARE MADE. IT'S easier for you to know that you don't have the Holy Spirit. It's easy FOR YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. Your choices will speak to you. The things that you thirst for are the things that you will choose. As a matter of fact, thirsting and hungering after righteousness is the greatest gift to the believers. The kind of music that you choose to listen to, THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT YOU CHOOSE TO GET ALONG WITH, the places YOU GO TO, WHAT YOU DRESS AND WHAT YOU LOOK at shows exactly who you are. It's a choice you have in this age. When I get my phone, I have a choice what to look at on my YouTube. I have a choice which application to open at. I have a choice. Your choice reflects what is in your mind. And what your future is going TO BE, YOUR ENTIRE life is going to DEPEND ON THE CHOICES THAT YOU ARE MAKING. You look at these politicians, you look at what these men were and what they are trying to achieve. You see that they made a choice and they entered into the spirit of death until the man cares not whether he dies or not. I listen at young men at work. I look at fellow people friends there and I see when they enter the spirit they enter the spirit of it and it IT'S IT'S A CHOICE they made and it is just driving them whichever they do not care whatever whether they die. Someone is just so willing. I'm glad that someone can make a choice to live for Christ to pledge allegiance to the Lord. AND THEY SAID, "COME WHAT? I'll carry the cross." Before you can choose over anything, it's good to plan. It's good to look. IT'S GOOD TO PRAY. WE FIND THAT IF YOU did pray and you make a wrong choice, God will deliver you somehow. When you get to making a choice, don't choose depending upon the sight of beauty. magnific marriage. I'm not trying to talk about marriage. Because now you may be even already married. Now take it somewhere else. Don't choose according to beauty. It may BE A CHURCH. DON'T CHOOSE FRIENDS ACCORDING TO THEIR MAGN RICHES whatsoever shining. SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO CHOOSE THE HARDER WAY. I want to end with that quotation. Straight is the gate. Uh, paragraph 57. The prophet says none of us wants to choose a harder way. We don't want that. We also don't want it. But sometimes you have to CHOOSE THE HARDER. YOU SEE GOD TOLD THE Lord run as far as the mountain. He said, "Let me go to this." But what happened now? His daughters raped him. If you had run where God told sometimes you have got to choose the hard when God gives you what to choose and when he gives you what to choose he has helped you so much just take that WAY YOU SEE WHEN ABRAHAM WAS SITTING UNDER HIS TENT BECAUSE HE HAD MADE A CHOICE AND THAT CHOICE VOICE IS BROUGHT BEFORE EVERY PERSON THAT'S KNOWN IN this world. The tree of good and evil is set before every person. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It says Lord didn't think that he was going No, no, no. Sorry. Uh and when uh yeah, Lot didn't think that he was going to backslide, but when he WENT TO LOOK TOWARD Sodom where things were easy, there's many times we LOOK TOWARD THE EASY WAY AND YOU join this certain certain church and you see nobody will say anything against it because is the biggest church in the city. is the way. Many times we do that when we are wrong. Time is first spent. Let me skip and conclude. Let me leave that quotation. Let me conclude with this standing in the gap. Let me leave that one. Yes, I have some. Is it all right? Amen. Amen. Paragraph 131 there. This is the the best I wanted to read. [clears throat] I was preaching in Los Angeles at the businessman's breakfast something they just laying down on those organizations there set the headman of the assemblies and many of the great dignitaries there and when I got through speaking and started to leave the platform getting ready the message was being sent out across the nation on radio and had to change back during this CHANGE WHEN THEY CUT off the radio to send that message out come back announced the station and I was at Clifton is where they have the breakfast as I I was working from the upper platform to the lower finally some looking younger fellow of about 30 years old forth and threw his arms around me he I am Danny Henry Henry &gt;&gt; and not knowing what that is brother doing that tele televising know his brother brother was didn't want this look for words he just uses the nearest term and not KNOWING THAT WHAT HIS BROTHER DOING THE televising and it it terrifies Jesus for the Christian businessmen Russell Russell movie star in her mother is a Pentecostal preacher. I guess you understand what he's saying. Then when he started running to me, so he says when the young man money came and he ran to him, He throw his arms around me and he said, "God bless you, brother." He said, &gt;&gt; "I hope this doesn't don't sound that religious, but to my way of seeing it, that message could be the 23rd chapter of Revelation." And when he said that, he started speaking in tong. A boy who had never even heard of such a thing. The Baptist by denomination, you know. God wants to do something that even the critics won't have enough evidence to criticize. AS SOON AS HE TURNED white and he looked at me, HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. There is many sitting here. Was there was many who are there. He didn't know what to say. There was a GREAT BIG FRENCH WOMAN SITTING down here. She raised up. She said why that don't need any interpretation that was purely French. The boy said I don't know one word of friends and SHE HAD WROTE DOWN WHAT HE SAID. Look brother, there is no mystery that God can't have an interpreter. And then there WAS A MAN SITTING ON THE CORNER. He say that's correct. Two witnesses. I HAVE GOT WROTE DOWN WHAT HE SAID IS French in the back. He was the interpreter for the UN. And they compared the notes and this man over here was a victory of anic church out there. He wrote IT DOWN AND I'VE GOT THE INTERPRETATION to listen to this if I can read it. &gt;&gt; I Victor Lee is Victor. &gt;&gt; I'm a fully bloodlooded Frenchman. Born again Christian filled with the Holy Spirit. WHAT A CONFIDENCE. &gt;&gt; MY ADDRESS is 809 North Kings Road, Los Angeles 46.89 Los Angeles. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A TRUE WITNESS. If you are witnessing give us your full testimony, DON'T BE A COWARD AFRAID. GIVE US THE FULL DETAIL, your testimony. I'm a Christian. I have the Holy Spirit. I RECEIVED HIM IN SUCH and such time. I attended the Beth Temple. Pastor Annie Vic, &gt;&gt; a true translation that I proclaim of the prophecy said over brother &gt;&gt; given by Danny Henry Henry in French February the 11 1961 at the full gospel businessman's breakfast translation of the prophets Now here is what it is saying. Maybe you have never taken time to read it that way. That way that way. Such such a way. Now let us hear it that way. Because thou hast chosen because you have chosen well on the day, the narrow way, the harder way. THOU HAST WALKED IN YOUR own choosing. You have walked in your own choosing. I can see that with Moses. He had to make his choice. [snorts] THOU HAS PICKED THE PRECISE and correct way. correct decision and it is my way. I don't know how did he make this way. How did he make this choice? He compared it with underlined my way. Underlined my way. The Holy Spirit is speaking BACK BECAUSE of this momentous decision. A HUGE PORTION OF heaven awaits you. I wish you can take that to yourself. A huge portion of heaven awaits you. How that you WILL REACH IN GLORY AND PEOPLE is awaiting you. What a glorious decision. Thou hast made God is praising the decision of a man. Oh hallelujah. This in itself is that which will make and come to pass. the tremendous victory in the love divine. &gt;&gt; The choice of a man pleased God in such a God and embraced it and within testified of it and he said, "Oh, This is my way. Do you think it is hard for you to make such a decision? No, it's not hard. Just be drunk in the spirit. Wait upon God. Be certain of God, trusting in the Lord and have the confidence that you are son and daughter. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Shall we rise upon our feet? It's a decision that each one of us has to make. I just want to sing a song as our pastor comes as you think on these things. Amen. Grace I see. I want See friends, it's your choice. I think um what we have heard today is one [music] of the most important things in in our Christian faith. [music] Your choice will reflect your ambition. It will reflect your character. You know you can make many choices in life. You can make a choice to be educated or not. You can [music] make a choice when some of you students when you go to school. You can make a choice to have a good [music] grade or or not to. It's a choice. You can make a choice to find a job. If you don't have a job, you don't have an income. You [music] can be you can decide to just be coming to church and you have no job. Or you can actually make a choice to find [music] a job. You can make a choice to work or to be lazy. You can make a choice to pray or not to. You can make a choice. You [music] have to make a choice to over home church. You can make a choice to believe the word or not to. And you see each of us makes a choice. And it's an unconscious ability that we all have. We make a choice and we as believers should actually learn to respect each other's choices. Maven's choices might not be mine. I cannot enforce him to choose as I would choose. You understand that if someone has made a choice about their life, learn to respect them if they have made a wrong one, pray for them. But respect their choices. You know that is one [music] important thing really because as many times you find in many things in life people cannot respect others choices you know you find that everyone is forcing someone else to take [music] their choice but I want you to know each of us has a choice to And when you make your choice, there are consequences connected to that choice. And you are responsible. You are accountable because the choice was made by you. So listen, never be forced [music] to make a choice. Make your own choice. Always walk in the way of your own choosing. But as a Christian, as a child of God, I will encourage you to always be sure you in the will of God. And I will I will show you as we the preacher was preaching many times. The will of God is what we as human beings call the harder [music] way. And you know he he rehearsed the story [music] of uh of Lord. Come to think of it. Come to think of it just before we leave that God because of Abraham remembered Lot and he went to save Lot in Sodom. through the two angels. But when they arrived, and I'm going to read for you. I want you to listen to these words. And it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad. Now, the angels had brought the family of Lot and Lot outside of the city that he said, "Escape for thy life. Look not behind thee, neither thou in all the plain." Listen. Listen. Escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. Now the words from the mouth of the angel were saying, "Escape to the mountain. Tell your neighbor, escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed." But you see, the will of God was that they escaped to the mountain. But Lord said unto them, "Oh no, not so, not so, my lord, not so. Behold, now thy servant has found grace in thy sight, and thou has magnified thy mercy, which thou has showed unto me in saving my life, and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die. Listen friends, if the will of God leads you into any direction, take the choice without a question. Because the will of God cannot bring you to a place where his grace will not take care. We all ought to say amen to that. Why? Because God, Amen, watches over those that he has chosen. But you see this man thought he knew better than God. He said, "I can't go to the mountain. If I go to the mountain, I may die there. Something bad may happen. Whatever the word of God says, brothers and sisters, don't question it. Don't doubt it. Just believe it." And and he said, "Oh, and behold, now this city is near to to flee [clears throat] unto And it's a little one. It's not as big as where I have been. It's not as big as this one is city. Oh, let me escape. Is it not a little one and my soul shall live? This man always loved was obsessed with cities, good things, big things. brother, if you love good things, it's not bad, but be sure it is part of God's word. And he said unto him, &gt;&gt; "Okay, I've accepted you. Go, go, go, go." And he went there. But here is what I wanted to show you. This city was later called because he had gone there it was called insignificant &gt;&gt; insignificant. So God now told him you can go but the place where he went to was insignificant. The permissive will of God usually will bring you to an insignificant. And later on of course we know that he actually when he went to this place he even feared later on to even live in that place. Exactly. He end up living in a mountain in a cave. The will of God never bring you to a place where his grace will not sustain you. Hallelujah. The will of God is the word of God. The will of God is the word from the mouth of the angel. The will of God is the word which never fails. Praise the name of the Lord. And so let's always walk in the will of God. Make our choices [music] according to the word. Amen. Let us sing a song that says, I don't want nothing here to hinder me as we give our offerings. Amen. Praise God. Trying to find &gt;&gt; You got the words, brother. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I don't It's an old song we used to sing many many years ago. [music] I hope brother brother Noble you know the song nothing here to hinder me &gt;&gt; for someday there's a crown one day I heard a voice he said if you will make me your choice I'll drive away your every care you free. So I came to him that day and he took my sin away. Now I don't want nothing here to be. One day I heard a voice saying, [singing] "If you make your choice, I'll drive away your every care and set you free." [singing] So [music] I came [singing] to him that day and he took my [music] sin away. Now I don't want nothing here or to [singing and music] hinder me. I don't want I [music] don't want [singing] nothing here or to me. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; for [music] Sunday. Oh, please. I want [music] to see it makes no difference [music] what the cost. [singing] Oh, how heavy [music] is the cross. I don't want nothing to hear me. [music] Listen it once. Well, often times I'm tossed about and [singing] often [music] times I do without. And of times [music] my heart is [singing] filled with grief and pain. But if on me I can stand true. I know [music and singing] that he will see me through. I don't want nothing here [singing] to hinder me. [music] Sing with me now. Oh, I don't [singing] want nothing [music] here. Oh, you in the m. [singing and music] Oh, is this blessed? Oh, I [singing] want to see. [music] It makes no difference. It makes no difference. [music] What a cross. [singing] Oh, how heavy is my [music] cross. Oh, I don't want [singing] oh nothing [music] to eat. Now [music and singing] someday now someday when I get home. Amen. Never more [singing] on earth. [music] with my Jesus [singing] and my loved ones. I [music and singing] shall be. I will rain my old cross down and [singing and music] receive a shining crown. Amen. I don't want nothing [music and singing] here. Hallelujah. to the me [music] nothing. [singing] Oh [music] for [singing] someday his blessed face. All I [singing] want to say [music] makes no difference. Makes no difference. Why? Oh, [music and singing] how heavy in my cross. I don't want [music and singing] nothing to eat of [music] me. All the way I'm going [singing and music] on. Let join in and let us worship him a little bit. All [singing] the way I'm going. [singing] Brother Shalom, come and help me. Where I'm going with the Lord. I made my decision. [singing] I [music] made my decision. I'm going [music and singing] all the way. I made my choice. Made [singing] my choice. I'm [music] going all [singing] the way. I made my decision. My [music] decision. [singing] Amen. All the way [singing] [music] [music and singing] back. [singing and music] I'm going all the way. I'm going [singing and music] all the way. the Lord. Amen. I'm [music] drawing [singing] [music] all the way. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I'm going [singing and music] I'm going all the way. [singing and music] I made my decision. [music and singing] In my growing myision, [music and singing] [music] [singing] my decision [music] I'm going I [music and singing] made my choice. I'm going all the way. [singing and music] Sing it all the way. [singing] [music] I'm going all the way. [singing and music] All the way. [music] I'm going [singing] [singing] all the way. [music] [music and singing] I'm going away. [music and singing] [singing] [music] I [singing] [music] am going on [music] [singing] [music] [singing] [music] [singing] the Amen. Going on [singing] with the Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; You see friends, I want to tell you before with this piece in the Lord is a choice. Living [music] right is a choice. Not looking at certain things. living around certain friends, [music] listening to certain kind of music, watching certain kind of videos. [music] All these are choices. But you see the choice of the Lord is the hard way. But he can't force you to make it. That's why even in [music] to the edge he says I am outside and I knock but he that will open for me. He that will make the choice to open for me I will come in [music] I'll s with him and heal with me. He wants to come in. Would you open for him? How much [music] time do you spend? How much time do we spend with the Lord? How much time do we spend with the Lord? You know gave us the story of Mary and mother. how this lady was so obsessed with cooking and washing plates and so busy with the business and and she did not pay attention to the more noble thing. The one important thing is laying at the feet of Jesus. Before we leave this service tonight, Why don't we make that choice, that decision to spend more time with the Lord, more time with the Lord in the word, more time with the Lord in prayer, more time with the Lord in fellowship. May God give us grace to be able to do that, to be in his presence. Thus, there's nothing more important than that. Your job is good. Your work is fine. Your food is good. Your family is good. Eating and cooking and all. But there's nothing more important than dwelling [music] in his presence. Lord Jesus, we come before you this evening repenting, Lord. We ask that you give us grace. Lord, that we might spend more time in your presence. Lord, we've made our choice tonight. It's our own choosing. The prophet made that choice and you said, "It's the my way." And because you've made this choice, you made this. There was a reward for gave us that grace. always to make that choice. We might not be popular or accepted by many around. We may be called oddball. We may be called many other weird but because of your name, help us to stand to make that choice to make that decision regardless of what that name shall be glorified. Father, we give you praise tonight. As I pray that you bless the the people, Lord, as they go to their homes, go with each and everyone. Bless the givers [music] that have given, Lord, and those that have not been able to give, Father, may you open doors of heaven that they might have something to give next time. Lord, what has been given into your house, may it be used for your kingdom. multiplied. Father, Lord, we pray even for those that have been streaming this, Lord, and whoever else that might watch this service later, maybe someone in a time, in a moment of making a choice, a decision, help them, Lord, and this inspiration will help you. Grant I pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you saints. [music] Just remember me in prayers. I'll be traveling with a few others on uh this Friday uh to tomorrow. I know there are several others who have already traveled and others will be traveling but I'll be back on on Saturday uh after the function for the service on Sunday. So we just remember the service on Sunday prayers will help us also uh pray and remember the function at sister mas as well will go well and I hope how many did you give an allowance for the ministry of the word four &gt;&gt; two ministers and three other people. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm talking about is there an allotted time for ah okay how many how long about 30 minutes. That's wonderful like a whole service. It's going to be some sharing of the word there as well. So I think that's a really if each of us can learn to to you know honor God in our in our function. I think those are usually wonderful rare moments to catch some people because you cannot get to church to give them the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let us remember that function on Saturday and also the other one tomorrow it will be like an outreach because both these functions people who do not know the Lord or not know this message will come. [music] Let's remember them in prayer. So God bless you saints. see you on on Friday night. &gt;&gt; Uh we've uh [music] scheduled uh a service one our service in Clovado uh on the YouTube channel if you missed it on Friday night at 7:30.
