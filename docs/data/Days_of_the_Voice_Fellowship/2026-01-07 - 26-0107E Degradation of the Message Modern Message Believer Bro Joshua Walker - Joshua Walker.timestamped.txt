[1:07:17] I see. [music]
[1:07:22] So I've told brother Josh to just take
[1:07:24] his liberty preach like he preaches when
[1:07:26] he's at home
[1:07:30] and being that we are late.
[1:07:34] I know these brothers are not long long
[1:07:36] preachers like us.
[1:07:39] So just relax.
[1:07:41] Don't be in a hurry.
[1:07:44] I know he will not be too long
[1:07:47] but that is not mean to say build short.
[1:07:51] Yeah. just take your liberty and you
[1:07:52] know [music] uh
[1:07:55] hang on to every word he's saying.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Of course, he doesn't preach like
[1:08:00] I preach. Every preacher is special.
[1:08:04] Every man of God is different.
[1:08:06] And so I want you to be expecting
[1:08:09] the Lord will [music] speak to your
[1:08:11] heart.
[1:08:13] It was grace
[1:08:17] that
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; my heart
[1:08:24] to please
[1:08:31] my [singing]
[1:08:32] face.
[1:08:34] [music]
[1:08:41] How great
[1:08:48] that grace [singing and music]
[1:08:51] I give
[1:08:55] the
[1:08:57] [singing]
[1:08:58] I
[1:09:06] bow our heads in a word of prayer
[1:09:10] Lord Jesus Jesus.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Lord, where would we be without your
[1:09:13] grace?
[1:09:16] Lord, it's your grace that has brought
[1:09:18] us through this life.
[1:09:20] It's your grace that has given us this
[1:09:22] message, oh God.
[1:09:25] Lord, and it's your grace that's going
[1:09:26] to take us back to earth.
[1:09:30] So Lord God, as we're gathered here in
[1:09:31] your presence,
[1:09:33] we ask Lord once more,
[1:09:36] come and speak to us in a special way,
[1:09:38] oh Lord God.
[1:09:40] Lord, you see the nerves, you see the
[1:09:42] you see the needs, you see everything,
[1:09:44] oh God, and I pray.
[1:09:46] May you come, oh God, and speak to us.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; We commit ourselves into your hands in
[1:09:52] Jesus name.
[1:09:55] Amen.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:58] [applause] God bless you.
[1:10:01] Nice to be here for the first time in
[1:10:03] Africa.
[1:10:07] Everything is new. Everything is
[1:10:09] exciting.
[1:10:12] It's all a bit unknown. Um,
[1:10:15] I'll say I'm out of my comfort zone,
[1:10:19] but it is a privilege to be here.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; We had brother Bazabosi in Australia.
[1:10:27] It was a it was a great thrill. Was we
[1:10:28] had a good time.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; So I bring greetings from the saints in
[1:10:34] Australia,
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; from my father-in-law,
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; brother Gary,
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; brother Tim with him.
[1:10:44] Bring greetings from everybody back
[1:10:46] home.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Uh as as brother Buzz said, I am married
[1:10:51] to brother Gary's daughter Hannah. We
[1:10:53] have three children.
[1:10:59] I grew up in the message. I'm a I'm a
[1:11:02] message child, shall I say.
[1:11:06] I have a testimony of the of God's
[1:11:08] grace, of God's keeping power,
[1:11:13] that though the world was there with its
[1:11:15] allure where Satan wanted to drag me
[1:11:17] into the world,
[1:11:20] but it was God's grace that kept me.
[1:11:25] And even though I was born in the
[1:11:27] message, I still had to meet him. Still
[1:11:30] had to meet Christ.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; So we thank God for his power to
[1:11:37] I'm not real used to speaking with a
[1:11:39] translator.
[1:11:42] If I speak if I speak a bit fast, just
[1:11:44] stop
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; and God will help us through.
[1:11:50] If we could turn in our Bibles to the
[1:11:52] book of Romans.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Book of Romans chapter 1 verse 18.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; I would like to speak on the degradation
[1:12:06] of the message. Degradation of the
[1:12:08] message.
[1:12:15] Or another title the Lord has put on my
[1:12:17] heart is the modern message believer.
[1:12:25] So we can read Romans chapter 1 verse
[1:12:28] 18.
[1:12:33] And it says, "For the wrath of God is
[1:12:36] revealed from heaven against all
[1:12:38] ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[1:12:40] who hold the truth in unrighteousness.
[1:12:56] Because that which may be known of God
[1:12:58] is manifest in them. For God has showed
[1:13:01] it unto them.
[1:13:10] For the invisible things of him from the
[1:13:12] creation of the world are clearly seen,
[1:13:15] being understood by the things that are
[1:13:17] made, even his eternal power and
[1:13:20] godhead, so that they are without
[1:13:22] excuse.
[1:13:39] Because that when they knew God, they g
[1:13:41] they they glorified him, not as God,
[1:13:44] neither were thankful, but became vain
[1:13:46] in their imaginations, and their foolish
[1:13:48] heart was darkened.
[1:14:06] professing themselves to be wise, they
[1:14:08] became fools,
[1:14:14] and changed the glory of the
[1:14:15] uncorruptible God into an image made
[1:14:18] like to corruptible man, and to birds,
[1:14:20] and for-footed beasts, and creeping
[1:14:22] things.
[1:14:35] Wherefore God also gave them up to
[1:14:37] uncleanliness through the lusts of their
[1:14:39] own hearts to dishonor their own bodies
[1:14:42] between themselves.
[1:14:53] who changed the truth of God into a lie
[1:14:56] and worshiped and served the creature
[1:14:59] more than the creator.
[1:15:01] Blessed forever. Amen.
[1:15:17] Amen. So let's turn also one verse in
[1:15:20] Proverbs chapter 4.
[1:15:26] Proverbs 20 uh Proverbs 4 verse 23.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 4:23. And it says, "Keep thy
[1:15:40] heart with all diligence,
[1:15:43] for out of it are the issues of life."
[1:15:49] Um,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 4
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; 4:23
[1:16:16] Scripture says, "Keep your heart because
[1:16:18] out of it spring the issues of life."
[1:16:25] There's another translation and
[1:16:28] above all else guard your heart for
[1:16:30] everything you do flows from it.
[1:16:39] May the Lord bless the reading of his
[1:16:40] word. You may take your seats.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; That word degradation, degradation of
[1:16:48] the message.
[1:16:56] That word degradation, it means the
[1:16:58] process in which beauty and the quality
[1:17:00] of something is destroyed.
[1:17:10] The quality is destroyed. It's spoiled.
[1:17:12] The process by which something is made
[1:17:15] worse.
[1:17:21] The message, we've been given the
[1:17:23] message, but Satan wants to make it
[1:17:25] worse.
[1:17:29] There's a spiritual, as we look around
[1:17:30] us, around the world,
[1:17:34] There's a spiritual and a moral decline
[1:17:36] in the earth natural
[1:17:43] society in America. You can see it.
[1:17:44] They're rejecting God.
[1:17:48] They're rejecting the word of God.
[1:17:52] But all the while claiming that he is
[1:17:54] God.
[1:17:57] As we look around us, there's problems
[1:17:59] with the youth. There's divorce
[1:18:01] problems.
[1:18:05] The morals of the world are degrading.
[1:18:08] They're going down. It's getting worse.
[1:18:14] When I was growing up in the message,
[1:18:17] we pretty much are never heard about
[1:18:19] anybody getting divorced.
[1:18:23] But now in Australia, in Europe, in
[1:18:25] America, I don't know what it's like in
[1:18:27] Africa.
[1:18:32] But people in the message are now
[1:18:34] getting divorced and remarried.
[1:18:40] All the while confessing we're in the
[1:18:42] message.
[1:18:45] There's because the issue is life has
[1:18:48] become so easy
[1:18:53] in Australia. Life has become so easy.
[1:18:59] We call it the curse of easy living.
[1:19:05] We don't need faith for our next meal.
[1:19:07] We have what we need.
[1:19:12] Life has become so easy.
[1:19:16] That God is not required anymore.
[1:19:21] I have it all. I don't need God.
[1:19:26] That is the culture that is coming into
[1:19:28] to the west.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; And you can see how the message was in
[1:19:35] the 1960s
[1:19:38] and what the message has become in 2026
[1:19:45] in the Ephesian church age.
[1:19:49] Brother Brandham says in the church age
[1:19:50] book, HE SAYS, "GOD being a savior,
[1:19:54] it was necessary
[1:19:57] that he predestinate a man who would
[1:19:59] require salvation
[1:20:05] in order to give himself a reason and a
[1:20:07] purpose of being."
[1:20:11] So can I say that when I needed
[1:20:14] salvation
[1:20:17] I became God's purpose
[1:20:22] because I needed salvation.
[1:20:25] GOD BECAME A SAVIOR.
[1:20:29] BUT BECAUSE GOD HAD A savior locked up
[1:20:32] inside.
[1:20:37] God required sin for the the savior to
[1:20:40] come out of him.
[1:20:44] God required somebody lost before he
[1:20:47] could be a savior.
[1:20:52] That is God's purpose.
[1:20:55] BUT CAN I SAY SATAN ALSO HAS A PURPOSE.
[1:21:00] SATAN WANTS TO GET IN THE WAY OF EVERY
[1:21:04] MOVE OF GOD.
[1:21:08] SATAN WANTS TO HINDER GOD'S PLAN.
[1:21:13] And I have news this evening.
[1:21:17] Satan is only bringing about
[1:21:20] those things necessary to to commit to
[1:21:23] God's plan. Hallelujah.
[1:21:32] SATAN IS SATAN IS helping God's plan.
[1:21:38] When you look at the Garden of Eden,
[1:21:41] it was perfect. IT WAS PERFECT. NO SIN.
[1:21:43] IT WAS PERFECT.
[1:21:46] BUT GOD COULDN'T DISPLAY WHO HE WAS IN
[1:21:49] PERFECTION.
[1:21:52] God required the sin to show who he was.
[1:21:58] God God HAD ATTRIBUTES LOCKED UP IN HIM.
[1:22:05] So God allowed SATAN
[1:22:09] through the serpent
[1:22:11] to bring sin into the garden
[1:22:16] so that God could show his attributes.
[1:22:22] God needed SICKNESS
[1:22:26] to show I'm a healer.
[1:22:29] GOD NEEDED PEOPLE IN CHAOS TO SHOW his
[1:22:32] attributes.
[1:22:36] My life CAN BE CHAOS. SOMETIMES MY LIFE
[1:22:39] CAN BE CHAOS.
[1:22:42] But through the chaos,
[1:22:45] GOD IS SHOWING HIS ATTRIBUTES IN MY
[1:22:48] LIFE.
[1:22:51] CAN I SAY God didn't have sin in him?
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; So he allowed the serpent to bring the
[1:22:59] sin to show who he was.
[1:23:05] GOD GOD NEVER LOST CONTROL.
[1:23:11] He just allowed ANOTHER POWER TO TAKE
[1:23:13] CONTROL
[1:23:16] to show WHO HE WAS.
[1:23:20] SO COULD YOU IMAGINE?
[1:23:22] I don't know how what time period it
[1:23:24] was. It could have been 100 years,
[1:23:28] a thousand years.
[1:23:30] But little by little, Satan through the
[1:23:32] serpent came to Eve.
[1:23:38] I don't believe it was an overnight
[1:23:40] thing.
[1:23:42] By little by little,
[1:23:46] the serpent coming to Eve,
[1:23:50] Eve, you are in the message.
[1:23:54] Eve, you are a part of Adam.
[1:23:58] Eve, you are in THE MESSAGE. YOU CANNOT
[1:24:01] send your day of grace away.
[1:24:05] Eve, everything you've BEEN TAUGHT IS
[1:24:07] CORRECT.
[1:24:09] LITTLE by little by little,
[1:24:13] Satan is coming against the bride.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; AND SATAN ISN'T TELLING THE BRIDE that
[1:24:19] you are not the bride.
[1:24:24] Satan isn't telling the bride that the
[1:24:26] mysteries are aren't unveiled.
[1:24:32] He's not telling the bride the miracles
[1:24:34] are not real.
[1:24:38] SATAN ISN'T telling the bride that
[1:24:40] brother Brham is the prophet.
[1:24:44] Satan's telling the bride, "Brother
[1:24:46] Brandham's the prophet." You say like
[1:24:48] that.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't want the bride to denounce
[1:24:54] the prophet.
[1:24:57] Just trying to get a compromise on the
[1:25:00] word that the prophet sent.
[1:25:05] SATAN
[1:25:09] SATAN CAN'T TELL ME THAT Malachi 4 isn't
[1:25:12] completed.
[1:25:16] But he can come little by little and
[1:25:19] tell me
[1:25:21] and tell me that some of the things
[1:25:23] aren't so important.
[1:25:26] The mysteries are unveiled. AMEN.
[1:25:31] SATAN WILL TELL YOU THE MYSTERIES ARE
[1:25:33] UNVEILED.
[1:25:36] SATAN WILL TELL YOU THAT BROTHER
[1:25:37] Brandham was Malachi 4.
[1:25:42] But he will come and he WILL TELL YOU
[1:25:43] THAT YOUR PHONE IT CAN'T HURT YOU.
[1:25:48] Satan will come and he will TELL YOU
[1:25:50] THAT YOU CAN GO AND look at that thing
[1:25:52] in the world. It will not hurt you.
[1:25:58] SATAN WILL SAY JUST CLICK ON THAT VIDEO.
[1:26:00] IT WILL NOT HURT YOU.
[1:26:05] BROTHER BRANDHAM WAS THE PROPHET. AMEN.
[1:26:09] BUT little by LITTLE BY LITTLE,
[1:26:12] SATAN WANTS TO DILUTE,
[1:26:15] water it down.
[1:26:18] He wants to water DOWN THE THINGS THAT
[1:26:20] we hold dear to OUR HEARTS.
[1:26:25] AND SO YOU can see in the message,
[1:26:28] LITTLE BY LITTLE, THE THINGS THAT
[1:26:31] separate a message church from a
[1:26:33] denomination
[1:26:36] ARE BEING DRAGGED OUT OF THE MESSAGE
[1:26:39] CHURCH.
[1:26:41] WHAT IS IT? SATAN WANTS TO TAKE THE LIFE
[1:26:44] OUT OF THE WORD.
[1:26:50] Satan is LOOKING AT THE WORD.
[1:26:53] AND SAYING THOSE THINGS DON'T REALLY
[1:26:55] MATTER AS MUCH AS YOU THINK THEY MATTER.
[1:27:00] He will say, "Yes, God sent a prophet,
[1:27:04] but some of the things don't matter as
[1:27:07] much as you think,
[1:27:09] little by little, LITTLE BY LITTLE.
[1:27:13] IT'S NOT OVERNIGHT. SATAN HAS TIME ON
[1:27:16] HIS HANDS.
[1:27:20] WE CAME to the message with the right
[1:27:21] motive, the right object.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; But little BY LITTLE,
[1:27:29] SATAN says you can wear the shorts IN
[1:27:31] THE WORLD.
[1:27:33] YOU CAN CUT YOUR FRINGE. YOU CAN CUT
[1:27:35] YOUR HAIR. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT
[1:27:38] BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE MESSAGE. BECAUSE WE
[1:27:41] HAVE THE TRUTH, YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT
[1:27:46] FROM MONDAY TO FRIDAY.
[1:27:49] BUT AS LONG AS YOU LIVE A GOOD LIFE ON
[1:27:51] SUNDAY,
[1:27:53] HALLELUJAH. We're in the message.
[1:27:56] And Satan says you're secure. You're the
[1:27:59] bride.
[1:28:02] Amen. That's the truth. WE BELIEVE THESE
[1:28:04] THINGS, but little by LITTLE
[1:28:08] THERE'S A COMPROMISE CREEPING INTO THE
[1:28:11] MESSAGE.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Some of the things that were blatantly
[1:28:17] wrong
[1:28:19] in the 1960s and 1950s,
[1:28:25] they're now acceptable in the message.
[1:28:28] So I wonder, [clears throat]
[1:28:31] has the standard changed then?
[1:28:35] Do these things not matter anymore then?
[1:28:38] Or is it Jesus Christ the same
[1:28:41] yesterday, today, and forever?
[1:28:46] So what's going on? The bars, as brother
[1:28:48] Brandon would say, the bars are being
[1:28:50] let down.
[1:28:55] sin creeps in.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; So I wonder, are the things that are
[1:29:00] coming into our life making us stronger
[1:29:03] Christians or weaker Christians?
[1:29:08] Are the things coming in making us
[1:29:10] closer to a rapture or is it pushing us
[1:29:13] further away from a rapture?
[1:29:19] And brother Brandham would say, "The
[1:29:21] ministers, the ministers are bending
[1:29:23] under the load.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; They're bending under the PRESSURE
[1:29:30] and they're conforming. They're
[1:29:31] conforming to an opinion rather than
[1:29:33] what the word says.
[1:29:40] We should be a spiritled church.
[1:29:45] We don't need something new.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; WE JUST NEED THE TOKEN,
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; THE NEW BIRTH
[1:29:53] TO COME AND INSPIRE WHAT WE ALREADY
[1:29:56] HAVE.
[1:29:59] We don't need WE DON'T NEED TO TWIST THE
[1:30:01] MESSAGE TO MATCH OUR OPINION.
[1:30:05] WE JUST NEED GOD TO COME AND INSPIRE THE
[1:30:08] MESSAGE
[1:30:10] TO CHANGE OUR OPINION
[1:30:13] TO MATCH UP WITH WHAT GOD SAID.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; There's no point having the great
[1:30:20] revelations that are unveiled to us if
[1:30:24] we don't have the life to back up the
[1:30:26] word.
[1:30:32] We could have the greatest preaching the
[1:30:34] world has ever seen,
[1:30:38] but if the life isn't behind the word,
[1:30:41] there's something wrong.
[1:30:45] We pray and pray that God revives our
[1:30:48] heart.
[1:30:51] But brother Brandham would say,
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; he says, "You watch the morals after a
[1:30:56] revival
[1:30:58] to see where that revival come from."
[1:31:06] So, Brother Brandham would say in the
[1:31:08] sermon, "A reaction to an action."
[1:31:14] He says, "Well, we don't want to be
[1:31:15] modern." I think that's slide five,
[1:31:17] brother. We don't want to be modern. WE
[1:31:18] WANT TO BE CHRISTIANS.
[1:31:22] WE DON'T WANT TO BE MODERN. We want to
[1:31:24] be Christian.
[1:31:28] It's not the modernistic trend that
[1:31:30] we're trying to keep up with.
[1:31:35] It's going to back to the old hewing
[1:31:38] lines of God's word as Christians
[1:31:42] and living like men and women were
[1:31:45] supposed to live
[1:31:47] by the order.
[1:31:50] by the order of Almighty God.
[1:31:55] So, we can see clearly by the word of
[1:31:58] God
[1:32:00] what age we're living in.
[1:32:03] We can see that we have the highest
[1:32:05] revelation of any previous age.
[1:32:08] We can see that we're in the capstone
[1:32:10] age.
[1:32:12] We can see that seven church ages HAVE
[1:32:15] COME TO THIS TIME, TO THIS DATE.
[1:32:20] BUT AS THE WORD gets higher and higher
[1:32:23] and higher,
[1:32:25] you can look around the world and see
[1:32:28] the morals are lower than they were in
[1:32:30] John Wesley's time.
[1:32:34] THE MORALS,
[1:32:36] THE MORALS, the morals are lower than
[1:32:38] they were in Luther's time.
[1:32:43] AND I wonder the things that were not
[1:32:45] allowed back there, they're now allowed
[1:32:47] now.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; So can I say that the degradation of the
[1:32:54] message, the beauty of the message has
[1:32:56] been watered down?
[1:33:01] The standard of the message has watered
[1:33:03] down.
[1:33:06] So what is the issue? Does the standard
[1:33:08] not matter anymore?
[1:33:13] Or has Satan got into the message to
[1:33:15] hybridize the seed?
[1:33:22] We never want to be a modern Christian.
[1:33:28] We don't want to modernize the message
[1:33:30] to fit 2026.
[1:33:36] Let my life change to line up WITH THE
[1:33:39] WORD.
[1:33:42] I NEVER WANT TO I don't want to change
[1:33:44] the word to line up with my life.
[1:33:50] It is our responsibility.
[1:33:53] IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS MESSAGE
[1:33:56] believers
[1:33:59] to line up with the word.
[1:34:03] I don't want to adapt and change and
[1:34:06] twist a quote TO MATCH MY LIFE.
[1:34:13] SO EITHER EITHER there's two options.
[1:34:16] Either the message was wrong in 1960 or
[1:34:19] something is wrong now.
[1:34:26] So I have an option. Do I pick and
[1:34:29] choose the quotes that I like or do I
[1:34:33] change me to line up with all of it?
[1:34:43] Do I say, "Lord, this is my opinion. I
[1:34:46] like my opinion."
[1:34:53] Sometimes we think we're quite clever
[1:34:54] with our opinions
[1:34:58] and we say, "Lord, I I have my opinion.
[1:35:00] I have my way ABOUT CHRISTIANITY."
[1:35:06] GOD IS LOOKING FOR AN individual that
[1:35:08] can lay aside their opinion.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; No matter no matter how good that
[1:35:14] opinion could be
[1:35:17] because the message IS JESUS CHRIST THE
[1:35:21] same yesterday, today and forever.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Cuz when I read the Bible, IT SAYS, "I
[1:35:29] AM THE LORD. I CHANGE NOT.
[1:35:33] SO THE STANDARD, the message preached
[1:35:36] back there is just as re relevant today
[1:35:40] as it was back there.
[1:35:49] So God is looking for a person that can
[1:35:51] have all of the revelation with a life
[1:35:54] to back up the revelation.
[1:36:03] Because brother Brandon would say, "I
[1:36:04] have a ministry to declare that he is
[1:36:07] here."
[1:36:11] How is he here? He's in your life.
[1:36:16] You have the revelation of the word, but
[1:36:18] he WANTS TO COME AND BACK UP THE
[1:36:21] REVELATION.
[1:36:24] GOD WANTS TO BE REAL IN YOU.
[1:36:30] I'M TALKING ABOUT A RAPTURE caliber
[1:36:32] person.
[1:36:35] I'M TALKING ABOUT A BRIDE CALIBER
[1:36:37] PERSON.
[1:36:40] I want to be rapture ready on that day.
[1:36:45] THE RAPTURE COULD BE TOMORROW.
[1:36:48] SO, LET ME CHANGE MY LIFE TO MATCH UP
[1:36:51] WITH THE WORD.
[1:36:54] Brother Brandham would say,
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; he says, "If there's the world inside of
[1:36:59] you, you must die to that world."
[1:37:06] And there Satan comes to Eve and says,
[1:37:08] "Eve,
[1:37:10] YOU WON'T DIE." AND EVE has the right
[1:37:14] answer.
[1:37:16] Eve said, "But he said, if we eat of
[1:37:18] this fruit, we will die.
[1:37:23] And then Satan says, "Surely, surely you
[1:37:27] won't die."
[1:37:30] But you'll be wise like God.
[1:37:34] That sounds pretty good, eh?
[1:37:38] They all had a desire to be like God.
[1:37:43] And Satan came to their human ability
[1:37:46] and poked and poked AND POKED.
[1:37:53] IS BEAUTIFUL.
[1:37:56] Sin is enticing.
[1:37:58] If there's someone sitting here and says
[1:38:00] sin is not enticing, you are lying.
[1:38:06] Sin is beautiful.
[1:38:09] Sin glows.
[1:38:11] BUT THERE IS A POWER INSIDE OF THE BRIDE
[1:38:16] TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION OF SIN.
[1:38:20] I'M TALKING ABOUT A PERSON WITH A
[1:38:22] REVELATION
[1:38:24] WHO THEY ARE.
[1:38:28] And Satan would say to Eve, "You'll be
[1:38:30] okay.
[1:38:32] Just go wherever your heart chooses to
[1:38:34] go.
[1:38:37] Just go where it feels good."
[1:38:41] And there's a saying in Australia. I
[1:38:43] don't know if you say it here.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; The young people would say the vibe felt
[1:38:49] right. Do you say that here?
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; V I E the
[1:38:58] felt good to go wherever I felt TO GO.
[1:39:04] BUT THERE is death in going where it
[1:39:06] feels right.
[1:39:10] There is death in going where the vibe
[1:39:13] feels right.
[1:39:17] And then God said we would surely die if
[1:39:20] we go back into the word.
[1:39:24] As I read in Romans 1,
[1:39:27] you've been given the word.
[1:39:31] Don't turn back on the word.
[1:39:35] And Satan would say, "Eve, SURELY YOU
[1:39:37] WON'T DIE.
[1:39:39] GOD IS LOVE,
[1:39:42] GOD of acceptance."
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; And then Brother Brandon would say, "No,
[1:39:47] he's a God of judgment."
[1:39:53] And then they would say, "Well, let's
[1:39:54] just let any sort of music come into the
[1:39:56] church. Let's just change OUR WAY OF
[1:39:59] WORSHIP.
[1:40:01] LET US GO WHERE IT feels right.
[1:40:06] MY LITTLE
[1:40:09] music that was wrong in 1950, in 1960 is
[1:40:14] now okay in the message.
[1:40:19] And they would say, "Can you not feel
[1:40:21] the atmosphere?
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Can [snorts] you not feel that shiver
[1:40:26] run down your spine?
[1:40:32] Satan has the ability to create an
[1:40:34] ATMOSPHERE
[1:40:36] through that music. Satan can come on
[1:40:39] that music.
[1:40:42] Satan can pump up an atmosphere.
[1:40:47] Never go off emotion.
[1:40:51] Never go off emotion.
[1:40:55] THE ATMOSPHERE MIGHT FEEL REAL GOOD.
[1:40:59] BUT WHAT DOES THE WORD SAY?
[1:41:03] LET me change my opinion to what the
[1:41:06] word say.
[1:41:10] The whole purpose of a song service
[1:41:14] is so that your heart can be opened up
[1:41:16] to receive the word that is coming.
[1:41:22] The atmosphere in the music is wrong.
[1:41:27] What is your heart being opened up to
[1:41:29] receive?
[1:41:32] So you can see in the message
[1:41:35] things aren't just said to fill a few
[1:41:38] pages.
[1:41:41] There is a purpose to the things that
[1:41:43] are in the message.
[1:41:47] Don't go with emotion.
[1:41:51] Stay with the word of God
[1:41:55] because heavens and earth will pass
[1:41:57] away.
[1:41:58] MY WORD will never pass away.
[1:42:02] Let me in the right atmosphere.
[1:42:06] Open my heart to receive the word.
[1:42:13] I'm talking about the bride receiving
[1:42:15] the SEED OF CHRIST.
[1:42:19] THE SEED of Christ is what will take you
[1:42:21] from this world to another world.
[1:42:27] The bride has the seed of Christ.
[1:42:31] Satan wants to intermingle his seed with
[1:42:35] God's word.
[1:42:40] And that's what brother Brandham would
[1:42:41] call hybridization.
[1:42:46] You can read quote after quote on
[1:42:48] hybridization.
[1:42:51] You can read why it's wrong.
[1:42:55] Why is it wrong? Is because now the seed
[1:42:58] doesn't have the ability to reproduce
[1:43:01] anymore.
[1:43:05] The message, the message of the hour,
[1:43:06] the whole purpose of the message
[1:43:10] is to REPRODUCE CHRIST.
[1:43:14] SO IF SATAN CAN WATER DOWN THE WORD,
[1:43:20] the message cannot fulfill its purpose.
[1:43:24] GOD IS LOOKING FOR A LIFE. GOD IS
[1:43:28] LOOKING FOR A PERSON HERE WHO CAN SAY
[1:43:31] I'M CHANGING MY opinion
[1:43:34] so that THE WORD CAN BE COMPLETED IN MY
[1:43:37] LIFE
[1:43:39] AND GOD IS GOING THROUGH THE EARTH
[1:43:41] SAYING GIVE ME A LIFE.
[1:43:44] I'M LOOKING FOR A VESSEL
[1:43:48] THAT CAN CHANGE AND SAY, "LORD, NOT MY
[1:43:50] WILL.
[1:43:52] LET MY WILL BE DONE.
[1:43:57] You may never feel a thing."
[1:44:01] Like Mary, SHE NEVER FELT a an emotion,
[1:44:06] but the word was being formed in her
[1:44:09] way.
[1:44:12] When did the persecution start for Mary?
[1:44:15] It's when the word WAS DISPLAYED.
[1:44:19] SOMETHING IS CHANGING IN THE WORD.
[1:44:22] Mary had her own opinion.
[1:44:26] HOW CAN THESE THINGS BE
[1:44:30] SAID, "BE IT UNTO ME
[1:44:33] ACCORDING TO your word."
[1:44:36] GOD DOES NOT REQUIRE OUR OPINION.
[1:44:40] GOD DOES NOT REQUIRE OUR INTERPRETATION.
[1:44:45] HE REQUIRES FAITH IN THE WORD HE HAS
[1:44:48] SPOKEN.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS LOOKING FOR A VESSEL THAT CAN
[1:44:52] SAY YES LORD
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; BE UNTO ME ACCORDING TO YOUR WILL.
[1:45:02] Satan comes and he says these things DO
[1:45:05] NOT MATTER.
[1:45:09] HE'S taking the life out of the word.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Did you know you can read this, but if
[1:45:16] it's not mingled with life,
[1:45:21] this has no effect.
[1:45:27] who requires a lot.
[1:45:30] I'm so thankful that we had a prophet in
[1:45:33] this hour.
[1:45:35] Now, we preach a sermon like anointed
[1:45:37] ones at the end times.
[1:45:42] Just because they're speaking in
[1:45:43] tongues, interpretations
[1:45:45] doesn't mean God is behind it.
[1:45:51] I'm thankful that we are not ignorant TO
[1:45:54] SATAN'S TACTICS.
[1:45:59] SATAN CAN come and impersonate every
[1:46:02] gift. Brother Brandon was saying,
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; BUT HE CANNOT IMPERSONATE THE LIFE OF
[1:46:09] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:46:13] AND THAT IS WHY SATAN WANTS TO TELL each
[1:46:15] and EVERYONE
[1:46:18] that you have the word but some things
[1:46:21] ARE NOT IMPORTANT.
[1:46:25] HE WANTS TO put his own opinion into
[1:46:28] God's word.
[1:46:31] He wants to put his own opinion into
[1:46:33] what God has said.
[1:46:37] UNLESS YOU STOP AND SAY THAT MIGHT BE
[1:46:39] RIGHT.
[1:46:43] The life that you have no longer has the
[1:46:46] ability to reproduce.
[1:46:55] The whole purpose of the message is to
[1:46:57] put God back into his children
[1:47:04] into the church again.
[1:47:07] Just because there's an atmosphere, an
[1:47:09] emotion
[1:47:14] doesn't mean God IS BEHIND YOU.
[1:47:18] IT MUST LINE UP WITH the words.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; As brother Brandon would say, he says,
[1:47:24] "STUDY THE ENEMY'S TACTICS. KNOW HIS
[1:47:28] WAYS.
[1:47:31] Know his method."
[1:47:34] SATAN WANTS TO HYBRIDIZE GOD'S SCENE AND
[1:47:37] BRING DEATH TO THE BODY.
[1:47:43] Satan wants to get back to the GARDEN OF
[1:47:45] EDEN. HE'S TRYING TO GET BACK.
[1:47:50] He's saying, "If I can attach myself to
[1:47:52] you, I CAN GO BACK."
[1:47:57] GOD IS looking for A VESSEL,
[1:48:00] NOT ME.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Stand with the word of God
[1:48:07] regardless if IT COST ME FAMILY,
[1:48:10] FRIENDS,
[1:48:12] WHETHER MY CHURCH kicks me out,
[1:48:15] I will stand with the word.
[1:48:21] Satan is trying to get us to eat of THAT
[1:48:23] TREE ONCE AGAIN.
[1:48:28] SO SATAN, Satan comes, he says, "Eve,
[1:48:31] you can't die.
[1:48:33] YOU COME FROM ADAM.
[1:48:36] I'm as eternal." Brother Brandham said,
[1:48:37] "As God is." Brother Brandham said, "I'm
[1:48:41] as eternal as God is." The bride is
[1:48:44] eternal.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; So Satan comes and he says, "You're
[1:48:51] eternal. YOU'RE SECURED.
[1:48:56] LOOK WHERE YOU COME FROM.
[1:49:00] The most dangerous place for a message
[1:49:02] believer is to feel secured because
[1:49:04] we're in the message.
[1:49:12] The greatest lie that Satan has in 2026
[1:49:18] is to say because you go to a message
[1:49:20] church, YOU'RE SAVED.
[1:49:25] IF YOU'RE SITTING HERE feeling secured
[1:49:27] tonight because you're in a message
[1:49:29] church,
[1:49:33] SATAN'S GOT YOU.
[1:49:36] Never feel secured because God sent a
[1:49:39] prophet.
[1:49:41] You can only feel secured
[1:49:44] when that LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST IS INSIDE
[1:49:48] OF YOU.
[1:49:50] SAY you
[1:49:52] born again.
[1:49:57] It's a false confidence to feel I'm
[1:50:00] secured.
[1:50:02] God sent a prophet.
[1:50:05] For 50 years, people have believed I'm
[1:50:08] saved. God sent a prophet. for 50 years
[1:50:14] because God sent a prophet.
[1:50:18] It goes far beyond God sent a prophet.
[1:50:22] It goes way beyond.
[1:50:25] Let me catch the reason why God sent a
[1:50:28] PROPHET
[1:50:32] change to match up with what the
[1:50:33] prophet.
[1:50:38] So many times we worry, we stress, we
[1:50:41] try so hard.
[1:50:45] Brother Brandon would say, "Just live a
[1:50:48] clean Christian life and the rest will
[1:50:50] take care of you."
[1:50:57] So we can see, brother Brandon would
[1:51:00] tell us in the church age book,
[1:51:04] he says, "It's not an apple that Eve
[1:51:05] ate." We know that. WE SAY, "AMEN.
[1:51:09] HE SAYS, HE SAYS IT WAS THE degradation
[1:51:12] of humanity, the watering down of
[1:51:15] humanity,
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; intermingling the seed.
[1:51:25] Eve was THE SEED OF ADAM, SEED OF GOD.
[1:51:31] But as soon as Satan's life was in the
[1:51:34] in THE WOMB OF MARY,
[1:51:38] NOW THE SEED of God was degraded.
[1:51:46] Now that seed couldn't reproduce Christ.
[1:51:53] But I'm so thankful that since that
[1:51:55] time,
[1:51:57] God little by little BY LITTLE
[1:52:01] HAS SAID, "I'M TAKING YOU BACK TO THE
[1:52:03] GARDEN."
[1:52:05] And now there's an Eve on the FACE OF
[1:52:07] THE EARTH.
[1:52:10] AND BROTHER Brandon would say there's A
[1:52:11] DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT EVE and this
[1:52:13] Eve.
[1:52:18] This Eve has already taken on the seed
[1:52:20] of God.
[1:52:23] AND GOD IN THIS AGE HAS POURED OUT HIS
[1:52:28] brother Brandon WOULD SAY THE BRIDE
[1:52:30] STANDS PREGNANTATED BY THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:52:36] SO can I SAY YOUR WOMB IS CLOSED? You
[1:52:39] have no room for Satan.
[1:52:45] And brother Brandon would SAY YOUR YOUR
[1:52:47] HEART IS THE WOMB.
[1:52:50] YOUR HEART IS THE WOMB. HE says you
[1:52:53] believe the word, you've taken on THE
[1:52:55] SEED OF GOD.
[1:52:59] HE SAYS, "YOU believe the word, the
[1:53:01] blood is applied, and now life is on the
[1:53:04] way."
[1:53:10] Isn't that an amazing thing to think the
[1:53:12] womb is sealed, BROTHER?
[1:53:18] So when Satan comes and says, "You're
[1:53:20] not the bride."
[1:53:23] You can look at him and say, "WHY EVEN
[1:53:25] BOTHER?
[1:53:29] I HAD THE MOST AMAZING thing happened to
[1:53:31] me the other morning.
[1:53:34] I just woke up and this this temptation,
[1:53:36] this thought just come into my mind
[1:53:41] and straight away I laughed. I said,
[1:53:44] "Satan, why bother?
[1:53:49] I can't disbelieve even if I wanted to.
[1:53:57] I couldn't even walk away if I wanted
[1:53:59] to.
[1:54:02] And can I say there's been times in my
[1:54:04] life where I'VE SAID, "LORD, I GIVE UP.
[1:54:08] LORD, I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
[1:54:11] I'm walking away.
[1:54:14] God's grace has already sealed the
[1:54:16] womb."
[1:54:20] AND GOD SAID, "YOU'RE MY SON.
[1:54:24] YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; YOU COULDN'T WALK AWAY.
[1:54:29] NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO,
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WILL HAUNT YOU.
[1:54:37] CHASE YOU
[1:54:38] UNTIL YOU SAY, "LORD, I GIVE UP.
[1:54:42] LORD, I'M COMING BACK HOME."
[1:54:46] HALLELUJAH. ASK THE LORD FOR GRACE.
[1:54:53] I thank God for grace.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; We thank the Lord for grace.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; So can I say
[1:55:04] you can't take on serpent SEAT
[1:55:07] womb is closed.
[1:55:11] So when SATAN SAYS WHY DON'T YOU JUST
[1:55:14] COMPROMISE A LITTLE BIT
[1:55:17] there's something PULSATING
[1:55:20] SOMETHING ALIVE
[1:55:23] AND IT SAYS OH NO NO
[1:55:28] there's no hybrid I SEE
[1:55:32] as for me in my house
[1:55:35] we will serve the Lord
[1:55:40] and it's amazing it'sing Amazing when
[1:55:42] you look in the message
[1:55:45] and you see that one word broken by Eve
[1:55:48] caused all this chaos around.
[1:55:53] So now it's all of the word required to
[1:55:56] take us back TO [clears throat]
[1:56:00] all of the word.
[1:56:05] So now can I say you have become the
[1:56:08] word.
[1:56:10] ALL OF THE WORD. EVERY SINGLE BRIDE
[1:56:13] MEMBER makes up the word.
[1:56:23] There's no hybridized seed in her.
[1:56:28] SO WHEN YOU look through the message
[1:56:29] through the Bible,
[1:56:32] God has always hated the hybridization.
[1:56:38] God would tell the Israelites, "Don't
[1:56:40] marry THE CANAANITES.
[1:56:42] I'M protecting my seed.
[1:56:48] Don't marry the Moabites. I'M PROTECTING
[1:56:50] MY SEED."
[1:56:53] Jesus is coming DOWN THE LINE. DON'T
[1:56:56] INTERMINGLE THE SEED.
[1:57:01] JESUS IS COMING DOWN THE LINE.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; And even in the Bible, he would say if
[1:57:08] the children of the hybridized seed,
[1:57:14] they cannot enter the assembly of God
[1:57:17] for 10 generations.
[1:57:19] God hates hybridization.
[1:57:24] Satan loves harmonization.
[1:57:28] So Satan can get a church to compromise.
[1:57:34] Satan can get a pastor to compromise.
[1:57:38] If Satan can get ONE MEMBER OF A CHURCH
[1:57:41] TO COMPROMISE,
[1:57:45] life is taken out of the church
[1:57:49] for Christ TO BE REPRODUCED.
[1:57:54] BE LIFE.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; And so many times, brother Brandon would
[1:57:59] talk about pastors, churches
[1:58:04] compromising for the meal ticket.
[1:58:10] But let us be a people
[1:58:13] who stand
[1:58:16] regardless of WHAT IT COSTS.
[1:58:19] THE MESSAGE should come with liberty.
[1:58:24] Stand firm in the liberty
[1:58:27] and be not entangled again with the YOKE
[1:58:30] OF BONDAGE.
[1:58:34] IF WE SAY I'm a message BELIEVER
[1:58:38] with a liberty,
[1:58:43] being a message believer doesn't come
[1:58:45] with a burden of self-care.
[1:58:52] Or should I say a burden of
[1:58:54] self-control.
[1:58:58] I live this way because I want to LIVE
[1:59:01] THIS WAY.
[1:59:06] AS BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY, HE SAYS,
[1:59:08] "I like to do that, but my religion
[1:59:10] won't let me do it.
[1:59:17] I shouldn't do it." He says,
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; he says, "That's the most miserable
[1:59:22] person I CAN THINK OF."
[1:59:26] HE SAYS, "IF THAT'S ALL WE'VE GOT, WE
[1:59:28] OUGHT TO BURY IT.
[1:59:32] GET YOUR SHOVEL AND PUT IT IN IT.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS IF THERE'S LIFE THERE, there
[1:59:39] should be emotion.
[1:59:42] I'M NOT TEACHING THAT YOU SHOULD SHOUT,
[1:59:44] YOU SHOULD JUMP, BUT THERE SHOULD BE
[1:59:46] SOMETHING PULSATING IN THE LIFE OF THE
[1:59:48] BELIEVER.
[1:59:52] BEING
[1:59:56] being a message believer being a message
[1:59:59] believer comes with a responsibility.
[2:00:05] Don't say I'm a message believer if you
[2:00:08] don't want the responsibility.
[2:00:14] We must conduct oursel in obedience TO
[2:00:16] THE WORD.
[2:00:20] IF friends cast you aside because of
[2:00:23] your Christianity,
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; because you wouldn't change your way to
[2:00:29] a modern Christian,
[2:00:32] a modern a modern message believer.
[2:00:38] I don't want no hybridization.
[2:00:44] I'll stay with UNADULTERATED
[2:00:48] GENUINE
[2:00:50] PURE SON OF GOD.
[2:00:54] There's no life in compromising.
[2:00:58] There's no life in hybridization.
[2:01:06] When you look at Jesus' LIFE,
[2:01:09] HE was rejected because he said, "When
[2:01:12] you see me, you see the father.
[2:01:19] Now the bride says, "When you see me,
[2:01:22] you see Christ." Hallelujah.
[2:01:27] You will be rejected.
[2:01:30] You're rejected because you wouldn't go
[2:01:32] to the dance.
[2:01:35] You're rejected because you wouldn't
[2:01:36] take a little social drink.
[2:01:39] The bride doesn't drink.
[2:01:42] The bride doesn't compromise.
[2:01:45] The bride doesn't GO TO THE DANCE.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE SAYS, "WHEN YOU SEE ME, YOU
[2:01:53] SEE CHRIST."
[2:01:56] HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say, he says, "You
[2:01:58] can't get pure and bitter water out of
[2:02:01] the same spring."
[2:02:08] The bride is rejected because they
[2:02:10] wouldn't wear the earrings, the makeup,
[2:02:15] is rejected
[2:02:16] for looking like a Christian.
[2:02:21] Jesus was rejected.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Let's not walk through life thinking
[2:02:26] we've got it easy. We've got friends
[2:02:31] as soon as there's a separation.
[2:02:35] You will be rejected for standing on
[2:02:37] Christ's word.
[2:02:41] Be confident though. Jesus was rejected.
[2:02:45] Jesus went through what you go through.
[2:02:50] Sometimes we place Jesus above
[2:02:52] rejection.
[2:02:54] SOMETIMES WE PLACE JESUS ABOVE BEING
[2:02:57] TEMPTED.
[2:03:00] JESUS WAS TEMPTED IN ALL THINGS.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus never compromised.
[2:03:09] COULD YOU IMAGINE WHEN JESUS DISCIPLES
[2:03:12] left him in the garden?
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine when the 70 left him
[2:03:18] for saying drink my blood?
[2:03:24] Jesus never tried to explain himself.
[2:03:28] He said this is my word.
[2:03:32] Could you imagine the hurt Jesus felt,
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; THE EMOTION JESUS FELT?
[2:03:40] WHEN PETER DENIED HIM that
[2:03:44] could you imagine just picture in your
[2:03:45] MIND NOW
[2:03:48] Jesus looked at Peter there's Peter
[2:03:50] sitting over by the campfire AND HE SAYS
[2:03:53] I NEVER WALKED WITH JESUS
[2:03:56] swore he said I never knew
[2:03:59] Imagine the pain in Jesus' eyes
[2:04:04] and he CATCHES PETER'S EYE
[2:04:07] might have been tears is rolling DOWN
[2:04:09] JESUS' FEET.
[2:04:11] HE WAS REJECTED FOR BEING THE WORD.
[2:04:16] YOU WILL BE REJECTED FOR BEING THE WORD.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we read the stories about
[2:04:23] Jesus.
[2:04:26] We think Jesus was easy for Jesus
[2:04:28] because he was Jesus.
[2:04:32] IT WAS NOT EASY FOR HIM.
[2:04:35] HE HAD TO DIE TO HIS WILL.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus won more victory in the garden
[2:04:44] than he did at Calvary.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; I didn't get it.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus won more victory in the garden.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; than he did at Calvary.
[2:04:57] That's what brother Brandham said.
[2:05:00] Because without the garden,
[2:05:03] there's no Calvary.
[2:05:05] And if you don't die to your own will in
[2:05:07] the garden,
[2:05:10] you will never go in a rapture.
[2:05:14] But let the bride say,
[2:05:17] "Be it unto me
[2:05:20] according to your word."
[2:05:23] If churches reject us,
[2:05:27] let it be for the word's sake.
[2:05:30] If friends throw me out,
[2:05:33] let it be for the word's sake.
[2:05:36] I don't care IF MY FAMILY REJECT ME.
[2:05:40] Let me stand with the word.
[2:05:43] LET ME DIE TO MY OWN WILL.
[2:05:46] SAY, "OH GOD,
[2:05:48] CHANGE MY OPINION.
[2:05:50] CHANGE WHO I AM. LET ME BECOME CHRIST."
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say in the same
[2:06:00] That six number six slide please. He
[2:06:02] says I stand at the door and knock at
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; he says I'd rather degrade my social
[2:06:08] standing in the community.
[2:06:14] Social standing.
[2:06:21] Can I say I'd rather be an outcast
[2:06:25] than to rub my name off the lamb's book
[2:06:28] of life?
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; So, can I ask you?
[2:06:39] What is your priority?
[2:06:45] Do you prefer your social standing
[2:06:49] or your name on the lamb's book of life?
[2:06:55] Because you can't have both.
[2:07:01] Those that are Christlike
[2:07:04] are rejected.
[2:07:07] Go read the scriptures. Go read Isaiah.
[2:07:11] Look in the message of the hour.
[2:07:14] Brother Brandham's friends rejected him
[2:07:17] because he said, "I will not
[2:07:20] compromise."
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; What if the Pentecostals say, "We give
[2:07:25] you a Cadillac. We give you a million
[2:07:27] dollars.
[2:07:30] Just a few little things though, you
[2:07:32] need to change
[2:07:36] that serpent seed doctrine. Just let's
[2:07:38] just let's GET RID OF THAT.
[2:07:41] LET'S GET RID OF uh marriage and
[2:07:43] divorce.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Let's get rid of Let's get rid OF
[2:07:48] BAPTISM IN THE NAME of Jesus Christ.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; Let's get rid of those things. WE'LL
[2:07:52] GIVE YOU SOME MONEY. WE'LL GIVE YOU A
[2:07:53] SOCIAL STANDING.
[2:07:58] I am thankful I had a prophet that would
[2:08:00] not.
[2:08:04] If the prophet had compromised there,
[2:08:09] all was lost
[2:08:12] because hybridization was coming into
[2:08:15] the sea.
[2:08:19] Search it in.
[2:08:22] God hates hybridization.
[2:08:27] But so many times we read stories about
[2:08:29] Jesus, we think it's easy.
[2:08:35] JESUS didn't care. They hated him.
[2:08:38] He was a man with a heavy burden.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; 30 years old, they said, "You look about
[2:08:44] 50."
[2:08:59] Comes down to your
[2:09:10] what Jesus went through.
[2:09:13] What happens IS YOU SEE YOUR OWN
[2:09:15] SITUATION.
[2:09:20] You can see your story,
[2:09:30] right? It's not a and I should close.
[2:09:35] In Australia, we say I'm closing. Then
[2:09:37] 20 minutes, we say I'm closing.
[2:09:40] Then 20 minutes we say we're closing.
[2:09:46] But so so many times,
[2:09:50] so many times we read the scripture
[2:09:53] and we place Jesus as some far off
[2:09:56] external deity.
[2:10:02] OUT THERE.
[2:10:04] That is what denominations have. God out
[2:10:07] there.
[2:10:11] But through the things we go through,
[2:10:14] we start to pick up what Jesus went
[2:10:16] through.
[2:10:19] We start to see Jesus HAD FEELINGS.
[2:10:23] JESUS HAD PAIN.
[2:10:26] But when Jesus CAUGHT HIS PURPOSE,
[2:10:30] HE COULD FACE THE REJECTION
[2:10:33] KNOWING CALVARY IS MY PURPOSE.
[2:10:38] THE SCRIPTURE SAID THAT JESUS SET HIS
[2:10:40] FACE LIKE FLINT to Jerusalem.
[2:10:46] THE BIBLE STORY MUST COME OUT OF THE
[2:10:49] word into alive.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; When I went to Sunday school, it was
[2:10:56] Bible stories. Bible stories.
[2:11:01] I HAVE BECOME THE BIBLE STORY.
[2:11:06] NOW I'VE CAUGHT THE REASON BEHIND THE
[2:11:08] BIBLE STORY.
[2:11:20] WHEN ALL YOU CAN DO IS JUST CRY YOURSELF
[2:11:22] TO SLEEP. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER
[2:11:24] BEEN THERE
[2:11:25] WHEN THERE'S JUST SOMETHING IN YOUR LIFE
[2:11:27] AND YOU'RE JUST CRYING AND CRYING.
[2:11:30] THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON AND YOU'RE
[2:11:32] BURIED.
[2:11:34] NOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE BIBLE IS
[2:11:36] BECOMING 3D
[2:11:39] coming out of the pages. NOW
[2:11:42] YOU CAN SEE WHEN JESUS WAS REJECTED
[2:11:48] HE CRIED.
[2:11:50] WHEN DAVID, remember in the scripture,
[2:11:52] when David wept over Jerusalem,
[2:11:57] he's a man rejected.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; But it's Christ in me, the hope of
[2:12:05] glory.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; I I And Jesus, the amazing thing about
[2:12:11] Jesus, he wouldn't degrade HIS WORTH.
[2:12:16] HE KNEW who he was.
[2:12:18] And Jesus wouldn't stoop down to
[2:12:21] religious leaders.
[2:12:25] He would NOT DEGRADE HIS WORTH TO KEEP A
[2:12:28] FRIENDSHIP.
[2:12:31] MY YOUNG BROTHER, NEVER CHANGE YOUR
[2:12:33] PERSONALITY
[2:12:35] TO KEEP a friendship.
[2:12:39] Stay true to who you are.
[2:12:48] Let Christ let Christ be seen in me.
[2:12:52] I never want to be stuck here praying to
[2:12:55] a God out there.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; I want a prayer to come from God to God.
[2:13:07] Let me explain that. When Jesus prayed,
[2:13:10] when Jesus prayed,
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; who was praying?
[2:13:14] Hallelujah.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; When Jesus prayed, who was he praying
[2:13:17] to?
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; And now, brother Brandon would say that
[2:13:22] he is in you as much as you will let
[2:13:24] him.
[2:13:31] Brother Brandon would say, "All that was
[2:13:32] in God, he poured into Christ."
[2:13:37] All that was. And that's good. WE CAN
[2:13:38] BELIEVE THAT. THAT'S easy to believe.
[2:13:43] Now, WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO YOU,
[2:13:46] ALL THAT WAS IN CHRIST
[2:13:48] POURED INTO HIS PRIDE. AND NOW HE'S
[2:13:51] LOOKING FOR AN INDIVIDUAL
[2:13:54] SAYS, "It's me.
[2:13:56] It's me."
[2:13:59] Remember that story of little Johnny? He
[2:14:01] saw himself in the mirror.
[2:14:04] He saw himself in the mirror of the
[2:14:06] word.
[2:14:08] So now when you're praying, WHO'S
[2:14:10] PRAYING?
[2:14:14] I DON'T WANT TO BE PRAYING to some great
[2:14:17] external God out there.
[2:14:22] But when I pray,
[2:14:24] oh God, MAY IT BE YOU talking through
[2:14:26] me.
[2:14:30] Sometimes I don't know what to say.
[2:14:34] So Lord, look at the light in my heart.
[2:14:42] That's what the message has done. It's
[2:14:44] put God back into a human race.
[2:14:52] Jesus Jesus was the first of a new race
[2:14:55] of people.
[2:14:59] Can I say the first,
[2:15:02] not the end?
[2:15:04] If he's the first, there must BE COMING
[2:15:07] MORE.
[2:15:12] IT'S
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; CHRIST Christ in me the glory.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; So that's now when it when it comes down
[2:15:20] we can read the Bible. We read the
[2:15:21] stories but when it comes down to YOU
[2:15:28] when it comes down to your situation
[2:15:31] that's the great battle. Now
[2:15:34] when there's pressure to compromise
[2:15:38] When there's pressure to say, "I can
[2:15:41] listen to what I want."
[2:15:45] When there's pressure, when your friend,
[2:15:46] your cousin says, "But I do it. Why
[2:15:48] can't you?"
[2:15:53] There must be a life that says, "I don't
[2:15:56] want no hybrid.
[2:15:58] I don't want to hybridize the seed."
[2:16:04] There is pain in saying no.
[2:16:08] THERE IS EMOTION with saying no.
[2:16:13] Let me lay my feelings and opinions
[2:16:15] aside.
[2:16:17] BE IT UNTO ME ACCORDING TO YOUR WORD.
[2:16:21] BE IT UNTO ME.
[2:16:23] IS THAT YOUR TESTIMONY? IS THAT YOUR
[2:16:26] WORD?
[2:16:28] BE IT UNTO ME, OH GOD.
[2:16:31] Or or do we compromise
[2:16:35] and degrade the message? Water down.
[2:16:40] What does degrading do?
[2:16:43] It takes the effects of the word out of
[2:16:46] the message.
[2:16:49] What does hybridization do? It takes the
[2:16:53] life out of the word.
[2:16:58] And if the life is taken out,
[2:17:01] We have church.
[2:17:04] But what did Jesus say?
[2:17:07] Did he say, "I've come to give you
[2:17:08] church and more church and more church."
[2:17:12] Or did he say, "I've come to give you
[2:17:14] life.
[2:17:16] I've come to give you life.
[2:17:21] I LOVE CHURCH."
[2:17:24] BUT IF THERE'S NO LIFE in the church,
[2:17:27] it's a WASTE OF TIME.
[2:17:30] IF YOU'VE been coming to church for 20
[2:17:32] years, but there's no life.
[2:17:36] You have wasted 20 years.
[2:17:44] Let us take the pain of rejection.
[2:17:48] I'M NOT COMPROMISING. I'M NOT
[2:17:50] HYBRIDIZING.
[2:17:53] Let us take the pain of that rejection.
[2:17:57] USING IT TO TRANSFORM INTO POWER FOR
[2:18:00] TOMORROW.
[2:18:04] We have a lot of problems. We have a LOT
[2:18:05] OF REJECTIONS. WE HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES.
[2:18:10] NEVER MAKE IT PERSONAL THOUGH.
[2:18:14] NEVER MAKE THE PROBLEM PERSONAL.
[2:18:18] THE problem has come
[2:18:20] so that Christ can be seen.
[2:18:25] YOU MUST OVERCOME.
[2:18:28] THE PROPHET WOULD SAY THAT God is not
[2:18:31] going to pull you through a PIPE
[2:18:35] and say, "BLESSED IS HE WHO OVERCOMES."
[2:18:38] HE SAYS, "YOU NEVER OVERCOME."
[2:18:43] You never overcome nothing.
[2:18:46] WHEN YOU'RE REJECTED
[2:18:49] AND YOU TURN TO GOD, YOU'RE OVERCOMING.
[2:18:53] WHEN YOU'RE REJECTED
[2:18:55] AND YOU SAY, "I DON'T CARE.
[2:18:58] LET [screaming] LIFE PULSATE.
[2:19:01] LET LIFE COME OUT OF ME.
[2:19:04] LET ME BE THE WORD WAVED OVER THE
[2:19:08] PEOPLE.
[2:19:10] LET me see my reaction.
[2:19:14] It's Christ."
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; Or can I put it like this?
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; The bride doesn't react. The bride
[2:19:22] responds.
[2:19:30] Can I say a reaction is something that
[2:19:32] happens without a thought. It's a quick
[2:19:34] reaction.
[2:19:36] If I put my hand on a stove, I pull it
[2:19:39] away quick as well.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; It's a reaction. It's quick.
[2:19:46] And sometimes people the reaction shows
[2:19:49] what the seed IS
[2:19:55] instant instant hand off the stove quick
[2:19:57] reaction.
[2:20:00] And if someone EROD IF SOMEONE CUTS YOU
[2:20:02] OFF ON the road your reaction shows the
[2:20:05] life.
[2:20:11] Cuz I'm talking about when you haven't
[2:20:13] had time to get your Bible and read,
[2:20:16] "How should I respond to the road rage?
[2:20:36] There's no time to call the PASTOR
[2:20:42] and say, "Pastor, what should I do?
[2:20:46] Someone cut me off on the road."
[2:20:51] The reason in Australia we have lanes
[2:20:53] and if you cut someone off honk
[2:20:58] [snorts] swearing out the window.
[2:21:04] Our roads are a little different.
[2:21:08] But you see your reaction shows the
[2:21:10] life.
[2:21:17] There's no time to formulate.
[2:21:23] I REACT
[2:21:31] and my father-in-law, brother Gary, you
[2:21:33] know,
[2:21:35] he has this saying.
[2:21:38] He says, "Road rage is not evangelism."
[2:21:48] YOUR REACTION
[2:21:51] SHOWS THE LIFE.
[2:21:56] I have a desire
[2:21:58] for the world to see Christ.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; I hope you understand my accent.
[2:22:14] And I find it amazing when you look in
[2:22:15] the message.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; How brother Brandon would speak so much
[2:22:20] against Elvis Presley and Pat.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; You don't need to give yourself away,
[2:22:28] but you go and listen to one of their
[2:22:30] songs. You listen to Elvis Presley sing
[2:22:32] Amazing Grace.
[2:22:36] Amazing Grace.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; That man HAD AN ANOINTING.
[2:22:40] THAT MAN HAD A VOICE.
[2:22:43] THAT MAN WAS GIFTED.
[2:22:46] Brother Brandham said he was gifted.
[2:22:49] He was sold by gift to Satan.
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; So I wonder if he sings Amazing Grace, a
[2:22:56] nice song, beautiful song. We sing it.
[2:23:02] Is it okay for me to go and listen to
[2:23:04] Elvis Presley sing Amazing Grace knowing
[2:23:07] the anointing behind it? [sighs]
[2:23:20] Well done. Amen.
[2:23:23] So, you see, there's an anointing behind
[2:23:25] it.
[2:23:31] And I'm not really here to talk about
[2:23:32] music. I don't have time to talk about
[2:23:34] music.
[2:23:37] But you can see there's an anointing
[2:23:39] behind the music.
[2:23:43] And brother Brandon would say that Pat
[2:23:44] Boon.
[2:23:48] He said Pat Boon should not be permitted
[2:23:51] to speak the NAME OF JESUS.
[2:23:55] SO naturally I go and I say who's Pat
[2:23:58] Boon? I get on Google. I say
[2:24:04] I listen to one of his songs
[2:24:08] and I think goodness that is very tame.
[2:24:13] There's there's compared to the music
[2:24:17] today
[2:24:20] is nothing. That's nothing.
[2:24:23] So I wonder
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; what has changed?
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; What has changed? Is it the Is it the
[2:24:29] standard has changed and now it's okay?
[2:24:33] Or has our opinion changed
[2:24:38] and gone the way of Satan?
[2:24:41] I'm not a prophet.
[2:24:43] I just have to believe what the prophet
[2:24:45] said.
[2:24:47] Is now my responsibility to line up with
[2:24:50] what the prophet said.
[2:24:55] So now Satan says, "If I can just make
[2:24:58] you compromise on the word,
[2:25:03] has anyone ever heard of Randy Travis?
[2:25:08] He's an American. He's an American
[2:25:10] country singer.
[2:25:13] Sings country songs."
[2:25:16] And this man says, "I don't write
[2:25:18] Christian songs because I'm a Christian.
[2:25:20] I'm not a Christian.
[2:25:24] I write Christian songs because there's
[2:25:26] money to be made.
[2:25:33] I wonder what the atmosphere is behind
[2:25:35] that song
[2:25:40] and I can listen to the song. It's
[2:25:41] amazing song.
[2:25:44] But something is wrong somewhere.
[2:25:47] There must be a conviction in the heart
[2:25:49] OF THE BELIEVER.
[2:25:52] THAT WHEN THAT CHRISTIAN ROCK
[2:25:53] Pentecostal music starts blaring
[2:25:58] and I know I'm on the other side of the
[2:26:00] world, but the word says what the word
[2:26:02] says.
[2:26:05] I will not compromise.
[2:26:08] Let me stay with what the word says.
[2:26:12] The message says it's wrong.
[2:26:15] The message says it's not PLEASING UNTO
[2:26:17] GOD.
[2:26:20] I HAVE A DEEP, let me tell you
[2:26:22] something. I have a deep DESIRE
[2:26:26] to have a God-pleasing life.
[2:26:30] Hallelujah. I want to GO IN A RAPTURE.
[2:26:33] I WANT to be the word walking.
[2:26:38] So if I have to change my opinion to go
[2:26:40] in a rapture,
[2:26:44] let me change my opinion to go in a
[2:26:47] rapture.
[2:26:49] Hallelujah.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; As brother Brandham would say,
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; he says the angel of the Lord likes only
[2:26:54] believe.
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; There's an atmosphere.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; So if the song surface is going and
[2:27:03] going and going
[2:27:05] then we say let's sing only believe
[2:27:08] AND THE ATMOSPHERE GOES DOWN THERE'S NO
[2:27:10] ATMOSPHERE no more.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; Can I say there's something wrong with
[2:27:14] the atmosphere?
[2:27:17] There's something wrong with the
[2:27:18] atmosphere.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; Do we believe these things?
[2:27:36] Prophet said 60 years ago doesn't matter
[2:27:38] anymore.
[2:27:42] It's right or wrong.
[2:27:46] Let's never hybridize the seed.
[2:27:50] The angel of the Lord liked that song
[2:27:54] and then we sing it and suddenly we have
[2:27:57] no atmosphere.
[2:28:00] Something is wrong with the atmosphere.
[2:28:07] Let me say this
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; and I hope we take it right.
[2:28:12] Let's not be affiliated with the message
[2:28:14] if we don't agree with the message.
[2:28:18] It's a waste of time.
[2:28:22] I want to go IN THE RAPTURE.
[2:28:25] YOU might not shake my hand at the door.
[2:28:29] Let me GO INTO RAPTURE.
[2:28:33] You might never want TO SEE ME AGAIN.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; I'LL SHAKE YOUR HAND in heaven.
[2:28:42] [sighs] Hallelujah.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; The amazing thing is brother Brandon
[2:28:49] would say when you look at King Ahab, I
[2:28:51] should close.
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say about Ahab,
[2:28:58] Ahab, King Ahab, the worst KING ISRAEL
[2:29:00] EVER.
[2:29:04] AND I READ THAT AND MY own opinion of
[2:29:06] course is there.
[2:29:09] And I say, "Yeah, but King Ahab never
[2:29:11] sacrificed his own children."
[2:29:15] Do you know there was kings of Judah
[2:29:17] that sacrificed his children?
[2:29:21] King Ahab don't seem so bad. He ain't he
[2:29:23] ain't killing his children.
[2:29:27] But that's my opinion.
[2:29:31] And then I come to find out,
[2:29:33] brother Brandon would say, "It's not
[2:29:35] because of the idol worship. It's not
[2:29:37] because of his wife.
[2:29:40] It's because he was a borderline
[2:29:41] believer."
[2:29:44] This was a man This was a man who said,
[2:29:47] "I'm in the message. I'M IN THE
[2:29:49] MESSAGE."
[2:29:50] BUT WHEN THE message says you should
[2:29:52] live a certain way,
[2:29:56] he said, "Yeah, nah.
[2:29:59] In Australia we say yeah nah.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; He was a makeel believer
[2:30:08] and he never come into the obedience of
[2:30:10] the message.
[2:30:13] He could see that Elijah was a prophet
[2:30:17] but he never came into obedience.
[2:30:20] HE CONFESSED GOD SENT A PROPHET
[2:30:24] AND HE just hung around the message for
[2:30:26] THE FEELING OF SAFETY.
[2:30:29] I want
[2:30:32] and a borderline believer is a person
[2:30:34] that tells the preacher,
[2:30:38] he tells the preacher,
[2:30:44] "DON'T PREACH ON THIS. DON'T PREACH ON
[2:30:47] THAT.
[2:30:48] NEVER PREACH ON MUSIC. STAY AWAY FROM
[2:30:50] THAT.
[2:30:53] NEVER PREACH ON THIS. PREACH ON SIN."
[2:30:57] Brother Brandon would say, "The
[2:30:59] preachers are bending under the
[2:31:01] pressure.
[2:31:05] Let us never never bend under the
[2:31:08] pressure.
[2:31:11] Don't try and change the message.
[2:31:14] JUST LINE UP WITH THE MESSAGE.
[2:31:18] There's plenty OF OTHER CHURCHES THAT
[2:31:20] DON'T believe the message.
[2:31:23] There is over a thousand denominations.
[2:31:28] FROM ONE BIBLE, THOUSAND DIFFERENT
[2:31:31] DENOMINATIONS.
[2:31:33] We have one message.
[2:31:37] Let us be the bride.
[2:31:40] Satan wants to separate into groups.
[2:31:44] LET US AS PASTORS, AS PREACHERS,
[2:31:48] PREACH THE WORD,
[2:31:50] HEAVEN HIGH.
[2:31:53] Heaven high.
[2:31:56] say gun barrel straight hell hot.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; I don't want the security of being a
[2:32:06] message believer.
[2:32:09] I want the security of being a believer
[2:32:12] of the word.
[2:32:15] Not just a believer, but a doer of the
[2:32:17] word.
[2:32:20] Let me change my opinion.
[2:32:23] Let me change my interpretation
[2:32:27] and say, Lord, I might not AGREE WITH
[2:32:29] IT.
[2:32:30] I MIGHT NOT understand it,
[2:32:33] BUT I WANT SOMETHING MORE THAN ANYTHING
[2:32:36] ELSE.
[2:32:38] I WANT THE LIFE OF CHRIST.
[2:32:42] AND IF YOU COMPROMISE ON THE WORD,
[2:32:45] it takes THE LIFE OF CHRIST OUT OF YOU.
[2:32:49] AND IF YOU WANT TO GO IN THE RAPTURE,
[2:32:52] Christ's life must be pulsating.
[2:32:57] I don't I DON'T WANT A SOCIAL RELIGION.
[2:33:02] I want Jesus Christ.
[2:33:05] So when the church wants to degrade the
[2:33:07] music in the message,
[2:33:11] let me take my opinion to the word.
[2:33:17] Go and look what he says ABOUT ELVIS
[2:33:19] PRESLEY. GO AND LOOK WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT
[2:33:21] PATON.
[2:33:28] He says this is a He says about Pat
[2:33:30] Boon. He says this is a man who sings on
[2:33:33] Sunday and lives like a devil on Monday.
[2:33:42] We call that a makeeliever.
[2:33:48] So let me anchor my faith in the word.
[2:33:52] Let me anchor my
[2:33:55] because man's opinion shifts. It changes
[2:34:01] in the 1950s, 1960s.
[2:34:06] Man had a way of doing worship.
[2:34:11] Now it's changed
[2:34:13] and it will continue to change.
[2:34:16] But the bride must line up with the word
[2:34:18] of God.
[2:34:22] Let me read you a quote in questions and
[2:34:24] answers.
[2:34:26] Look at slide seven. But he says, "Don't
[2:34:29] you like them old songs?
[2:34:32] Don't you like them old songs?"
[2:34:37] Listen. He says, "I want to say this.
[2:34:40] If we had more of those old songs
[2:34:42] instead of so much of this carrying on.
[2:34:49] I like the way the prophet puts it.
[2:34:53] So much of this carrying on that we do
[2:34:55] HAVE
[2:34:57] because I believe the church would be
[2:35:00] better off.
[2:35:03] He says I like those good old songs
[2:35:05] penned by the Holy Spirit.
[2:35:11] Let me line up with the word of God.
[2:35:16] I'm going to close.
[2:35:21] [laughter]
[2:35:23] So you see the problem that the reason
[2:35:25] why God hates denominations
[2:35:29] is because they've taken the life out of
[2:35:31] the word.
[2:35:34] And so the the thing with a denomination
[2:35:36] is
[2:35:38] The denomination has a program so worked
[2:35:41] out.
[2:35:44] The denomination has a a a entertaining
[2:35:47] song service that you can
[2:35:52] you see in the Pentecostal churches they
[2:35:54] got strobe lights flashing. They got
[2:35:56] they got music.
[2:36:00] They sing like you wouldn't believe.
[2:36:05] I'm from Australia. I don't sing too
[2:36:07] good.
[2:36:11] &gt;&gt; I'll just be quiet when you guys sing.
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; They have an ability to create an
[2:36:17] atmosphere with their music, with their
[2:36:19] lights.
[2:36:24] With the drum set beating in the corner.
[2:36:28] There's nothing wrong with a drum set.
[2:36:30] It's the way the spirit behind the way
[2:36:32] it's played.
[2:36:36] There's a spirit attached to it.
[2:36:41] So you see, you must guard yourself
[2:36:44] against the spirit.
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; So you see, a denomination has the
[2:36:50] program so worked out.
[2:36:53] They can create an atmosphere
[2:36:56] that they don't require God.
[2:37:00] They have an atmosphere.
[2:37:03] &gt;&gt; And they can preach a sermon like you
[2:37:05] wouldn't believe.
[2:37:08] They put us message preachers to shame
[2:37:10] sometimes for what they preach.
[2:37:14] But the issue of it is there's no life
[2:37:17] behind it.
[2:37:20] The life the life has been taken out of
[2:37:22] it.
[2:37:25] And because the life has been taken out
[2:37:27] of the denomination,
[2:37:30] Satan doesn't need to attack the
[2:37:32] denomination.
[2:37:34] He's coming to attack the message
[2:37:36] churches.
[2:37:38] He's coming against the message
[2:37:40] churches.
[2:37:42] And little by little, the denomination
[2:37:45] started off with a good uh a good
[2:37:47] incentive, A GOOD OPINION.
[2:37:51] BUT WHEN the word moved on, they stayed.
[2:37:56] Now the word is moving on in 2026.
[2:38:02] Stay with the word you had in 2025.
[2:38:07] Satan wants to hybridize. Satan,
[2:38:13] he wants to take the life out,
[2:38:16] but let the life stay in the message.
[2:38:20] Never let the word be degraded.
[2:38:24] NEVER LET THE LIFE BE TAKEN OUT.
[2:38:29] If your opinion doesn't match with what
[2:38:31] I'm saying,
[2:38:35] throw what I'm saying out. GO AND CHECK
[2:38:37] IT WITH THE WORD.
[2:38:43] [cheering] Go and check it with the
[2:38:44] word.
[2:38:47] So, a denomination has it. so worked
[2:38:49] out,
[2:38:51] they don't require God anymore.
[2:38:56] We can confess WE'RE IN THE MESSAGE.
[2:38:59] WE CAN CONFESS we've got church order.
[2:39:04] Let me see a life.
[2:39:06] Let me see a life backing it up.
[2:39:10] Let me see a godgiven atmosphere.
[2:39:13] LET ME SEE A LIFE THAT WHEN THERE'S
[2:39:15] REJECTION,
[2:39:20] They don't yell. They don't swear.
[2:39:24] But they say, "Oh God,
[2:39:27] forgive them. They don't know what they
[2:39:30] did."
[2:39:32] In life story, in the sermon, life
[2:39:35] story,
[2:39:38] Brother Brandham says, "I'm not afraid
[2:39:39] about Russia coming in and whipping us
[2:39:44] or some other nation coming in and
[2:39:46] whipping us.
[2:39:48] He says, "We're whipping ourself
[2:39:50] by our own morals. It's degrading us.
[2:39:56] It ain't the robin that pecks on the
[2:39:57] apple. It ain't the robin that pecks the
[2:40:00] apple. It's not the bird that eats the
[2:40:02] apple.
[2:40:05] It's not the wor It's the worm. It's the
[2:40:07] worm at the core that kills the apple.
[2:40:16] It's our own opinion inside
[2:40:19] that changes the way we look at the
[2:40:21] world.
[2:40:23] It's not something out there trying to
[2:40:25] get you.
[2:40:28] It's something in the inside trying to
[2:40:30] get you to change who you are.
[2:40:33] He says, "And I tell you, brother."
[2:40:37] He says, "You let a woman get an old
[2:40:38] taste of salvation
[2:40:42] and it'll straighten her up."
[2:40:45] &gt;&gt; Straighten her up.
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; The amazing thing is in the lady you see
[2:40:49] in church age,
[2:40:52] Revelations chapter 3,
[2:40:55] the scripture says it's the spirit, the
[2:40:57] spirit talking to the age.
[2:41:01] And it says, "Thou sayest, I AM
[2:41:03] INCREASED WITH GOODS. I have need of
[2:41:06] nothing."
[2:41:08] What are they saying? We've got the
[2:41:09] prophet. WE GOT A CHURCH STRUCTURE. We
[2:41:11] have an entertaining song service.
[2:41:15] We have an amazing ministry.
[2:41:18] I don't need nothing.
[2:41:22] I'm secure with the message.
[2:41:26] And the spirit answers back. And the
[2:41:28] spirit's saying, "THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
[2:41:30] SAYING.
[2:41:31] BUT SAY I SAY thou art wretched, naked,
[2:41:36] BLIND, AND DON'T KNOW IT.
[2:41:40] BUT THE MESSAGE HAS COME TO CALL THE
[2:41:43] bride out of Leia.
[2:41:46] I heard a voice AND IT SAID, "COME OUT
[2:41:49] OF HER,
[2:41:51] MY PEOPLE."
[2:41:53] DID YOU ever see HE CALLED YOU MY
[2:41:56] PEOPLE?
[2:41:58] YOU HAVE BEEN BOUGHT WITH A PRICE.
[2:42:02] LAY ASIDE YOUR OPINION.
[2:42:05] YOU HAVE BEEN BOUGHT WITH A PRICE.
[2:42:08] YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY.
[2:42:11] RAISE THE STANDARD OF THE WORD.
[2:42:15] AND SAY THE CHURCH WORLD IS GOING THAT
[2:42:17] WAY.
[2:42:19] THE WORD SAYS GO THAT WAY. I'M GOING
[2:42:22] THIS WAY.
[2:42:24] THOUGH IT HURTS, THOUGH FRIENDS REJECT
[2:42:27] ME. THOUGH THE CHURCHES REJECT ME,
[2:42:32] I WILL STAND WITH CHRIST.
[2:42:35] CHRIST IS LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY.
[2:42:38] THEY WILL SAY, "I'M NOT HYBRIDIZING.
[2:42:41] GIVE ME LIFE. GIVE ME LIFE IN ABUNDANCE.
[2:42:45] BE IT UNTO ME ACCORDING TO ME.
[2:42:49] Let's stand to our feet. Let's stand to
[2:42:51] our feet.
[2:42:54] It doesn't matter what our opinion says.
[2:42:58] IT DOESN'T MATTER.
[2:43:00] REGARDLESS OF the evidence,
[2:43:03] Joshua and Caleb, REGARDLESS OF THE
[2:43:06] EVIDENCE,
[2:43:07] WE CAN TAKE the land.
[2:43:11] Regardless what THE ME WHAT EVERYONE
[2:43:13] SAYS,
[2:43:14] WHAT THE MESSAGE says on raising our
[2:43:17] families,
[2:43:20] it still matters.
[2:43:26] What the message says on how we should
[2:43:28] TREAT ONE ANOTHER.
[2:43:30] STILL MATTERS.
[2:43:34] &gt;&gt; Churches and brother Brandon would say,
[2:43:35] "I drew the circle wider." THEY STEPPED
[2:43:37] OUT. I DREW it wider.
[2:43:43] Let me let me let me lay aside my
[2:43:46] opinion and draw the circle wider.
[2:43:51] By this
[2:43:53] shall all men know you are my disciples.
[2:43:57] And you have love one for another.
[2:44:01] I'm not talking about a filio natural
[2:44:03] love.
[2:44:05] I'm talking about an agape love
[2:44:09] that loves when there can't be love
[2:44:14] that is proven on a cross.
[2:44:16] THIS IS THE LOVE THAT GOD REQUIRES.
[2:44:20] AMEN. AMEN.
[2:44:22] Let us preach the word
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; straight DOWN THE LINE.
[2:44:28] &gt;&gt; I WILL not compromise.
[2:44:31] Is there one here that wants to raise
[2:44:32] your hand and says, "I'm laying aside MY
[2:44:36] OPINION.
[2:44:37] I'M LAYING ASIDE MY INTERPRETATION.
[2:44:42] As the world as the world goes one way,
[2:44:46] I'm going with Christ.
[2:44:49] I'm going with Christ.
[2:44:51] Eve. [cheering]
[2:44:52] Eve. Eve knew the truth but wouldn't
[2:44:54] walk in it.
[2:44:58] We know the truth.
[2:45:01] &gt;&gt; Let us walk in it.
[2:45:04] &gt;&gt; In a world of chaos.
[2:45:06] Remember what I said at the start. God
[2:45:08] can't be displayed in perfection.
[2:45:17] God requires chaos
[2:45:23] in a struggle. Christ is displayed.
[2:45:28] And when everything's falling apart, you
[2:45:30] stand. Christ is displayed.
[2:45:34] Amen.
[2:45:36] Amen. Make one more comment and we'll
[2:45:39] sing a song.
[2:45:41] A lot of people say
[2:45:43] the message is bondage.
[2:45:46] I grew up in the message.
[2:45:49] Can I say it felt like bondage for a
[2:45:50] while?
[2:45:53] I wanted to do certain things that I
[2:45:55] wasn't allowed to do.
[2:45:59] But the problem was I wasn't in love
[2:46:01] with the message.
[2:46:05] But when I met him, it went from bondage
[2:46:07] to love.
[2:46:12] I might like a certain thing, but
[2:46:15] because of love, I lay it aside.
[2:46:20] So the dos and the don'ts in the
[2:46:22] message,
[2:46:24] whatever they are, you know what they
[2:46:26] are
[2:46:28] to me, they're not dos and don'ts,
[2:46:32] but it's God telling me what pleases
[2:46:35] him.
[2:46:42] So naturally in a marriage, husbands
[2:46:44] want to please their wives. They want
[2:46:45] the wife to love them.
[2:46:50] Wives want to please the husband.
[2:46:55] So God is saying, "If you wear those
[2:46:58] shorts, they don't please me. If you
[2:47:00] wear that garment, it doesn't
[2:47:04] if you listen to that love song, it
[2:47:05] doesn't
[2:47:09] And the bride says, "Lord, I want to
[2:47:11] please you.
[2:47:13] &gt;&gt; I want to please you."
[2:47:16] &gt;&gt; And if that's not your desire, God can
[2:47:19] change it.
[2:47:24] God can change your desire.
[2:47:28] I want to live under a kind of
[2:47:29] atmosphere
[2:47:31] that pleases the heavenly bride.
[2:47:34] I want to leave live under a certain
[2:47:36] atmosphere
[2:47:38] that clears the goats out.
[2:47:42] &gt;&gt; Preach the word, brother. Jesus would
[2:47:44] say, "MY SHEEP KNOW MY VOICE.
[2:47:49] If what I'm saying sounds like a goat,
[2:47:52] check it with the word. Check it with
[2:47:54] the word. MY SHEEP
[2:48:07] The message shouldn't be making your
[2:48:09] life quality worse.
[2:48:12] &gt;&gt; The message shouldn't be making your
[2:48:13] life quality.
[2:48:19] Amen. But
[2:48:20] &gt;&gt; let me please my bridegroom.
[2:48:24] &gt;&gt; Let me please my bridegroom.
[2:48:28] Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; The amazing thing is at weddings often
[2:48:32] you see in a natural wedding the worst
[2:48:34] of a person comes out. Makeup, music,
[2:48:36] alcohol. Is that same here? It's in
[2:48:39] Australia. Message believers affiliated
[2:48:41] with a message. Sorry, I'm talking fast.
[2:48:50] Suddenly the worst comes out in a
[2:48:52] person.
[2:48:57] Or is it what they really are is coming
[2:48:59] out?
[2:49:04] Let me be Christlike.
[2:49:06] Let me be a message believer above all
[2:49:10] else.
[2:49:11] Let me be Christlike.
[2:49:15] And people get this worldly love song.
[2:49:20] There's an atmosphere behind it.
[2:49:23] THERE'S A SPIRIT. There's a spirit in me
[2:49:25] that says it's wrong.
[2:49:29] I must go and listen to that spirit.
[2:49:35] People find a song, attach it to their
[2:49:37] relationship, love, worldly
[2:49:46] and says this song describes our
[2:49:49] relationship.
[2:49:55] What spirit are we inviting into our
[2:49:58] relationship?
[2:50:00] What spirit are we inviting? We should
[2:50:02] never be ignorant of these things.
[2:50:05] Spirits never die.
[2:50:11] There must be a discernment in the
[2:50:13] believer.
[2:50:17] Throw the love songs in the bin. Throw
[2:50:19] it out. THROW THE LOVE SONGS.
[2:50:25] AMEN.

[2:50:31] I might love certain thing.
[2:50:35] I love sport,
[2:50:38] but I must lay it aside.
[2:50:41] Be it unto me according to your word.
[2:50:45] We have weaknesses in our life.
[2:50:48] Satan knows the weakness.
[2:50:51] music, sport, popularity, money, women,
[2:50:55] and he'll poke that spot
[2:50:59] all your life long.
[2:51:01] All your lifelong.
[2:51:05] There's no prayer that we can pray to
[2:51:07] remove the temptation.
[2:51:10] The temptation, the temptation is there
[2:51:13] to prove the bride.
