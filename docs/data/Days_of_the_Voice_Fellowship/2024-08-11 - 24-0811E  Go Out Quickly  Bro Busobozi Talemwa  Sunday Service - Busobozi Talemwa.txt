my wife and family brother brother umanga we had been uh we had we just been at Budd Christian Fellowship Christian fellowship with Pastor J bu and we just spoke to them this morning for about 1 hour and then we quickly ran back here but I felt so bad I just promised them I said we'll have to arrange again so that we can go for the whole day there and and so we we'll certainly arrange that in the near future so they sent their greetings amen so this is our second service service forgive us if our voices are almost gone so we are reading in the Book of Luke chapter 14 ver 16 Brother Martin you would have to just come and help me with this air conditioning it's distorting chapter vers chapter 14 ver 16 okay um then said he unto him a certain man now this is these are the words of Jesus is a parable of the of the great supper a great certain man made a great supper and B many and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bitten come for all things are now ready and they all with one Accord with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground and I must needs go and see it I pray thee have me excused and another said I have bought five York of and and I go to prove them I pray thee have me excused and another said I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come so that servant came and showed his Lord these things then the Master of the House of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly go out quickly into the streets and LS of the city and bring in hether the poor the maimed and the Hal and the Blind and the servant said Lord it is done as thou Hast commanded and yet there is room and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of these men none of those men which were bidden shall test of my supper let us have a brother read it in luganda and then we shall be seated for for amen amen you may be seated um before we continue I'd like to uh let you know that we are going to have the first um uh committee meetings today for the preparation of the youth meeting our youth meetings are already here it's just four months away and very many people are really expectant from talking to hearing from several around the country they're really warming up for them and remember you are the host of these meetings so four months we are going to begin two months late because we usually begin 6 months ear so we shall have the first of those meetings you know yourselves all those people that have been part of the Committees because we usually have different teams uh those who are working on food uh reception I know some I still at school but it's okay uh then those who work in media music uh what else advertisement yeah budget also the budget procur people and all those things so we are going to meet straight away after the service so I know there are I think some people that would want to meet meet will be afterwards are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning you have it ready you can bring it and make sure you give it to me after the yeah uh there is an invitation that we have uh to to to other me meetings this is it September okay we shall read the details for you when they get amen so this morning I just I got this inspiration uh when we were at home sharing with brother Joshua here and uh my wife and uh you remember Josh when I said I just got an inspiration something like that what I want to share with the church this morning and I want to title it go out quickly tell your neighbor go out quickly go out quickly now that's what I want to talk about I just took it out of the scripture and um it's not something I've made up go out quickly uh we were sharing about how God does his things and how God does a work that is short and quick and when God has you remember the other time we talked about the of visitation so really we still moving in the same inspiration when it is time for God to visit you he doesn't waste time he wants the to be done immediately quickly fast that's how God works God is not slow many times we feel that God is slow sometimes you pray and pray and pray for something and it doesn't happen and I know many of you are here and you have accused God of not answering your prayers and sometimes you you fast and it seems that your prayers are not being answered that God is not hearing your prayer because you prayed and God never answer according to you sometimes you want something so bad and after praying you don't get it and you feel this is the perfect time everything must happen now this way God is silent even when you are praying we saw last Sunday I think it was that God has a time God has a season of your visitation or of his visitation to you many times he will be silent but when the time has come amen he wants the thing to be done short fast immediately he's not a slothful god you remember I gave you an example how when God came down to Elizabeth you know whenever I think about that I Marvel I want you to imagine God allowing this woman Elizabeth to be baren for very many years she was a wife of a priest but she was baren without a child I'm sure she had a lot of people talking against her and she was praying Maybe but God watched over when all those things were going on and God did nothing God was silent God was quiet but at the same time there was a vision That was supposed to be fulfilled of a virgin conceiving and giving birth to a son and that was fulfilled when Mary came down now came to maturity I think Elizabeth was older than Mary much older than Mary but they were cousins so the whole time they knew each other so I want you to Imagine by the time Elizabeth got married God was quiet and Mary was growing God was quiet and and now even to the extent that now Mary got engaged and God was quiet and he waited at the perfect time when Elizabeth was available and Mary was available and everything was perfect aligned do you understand what I'm talking about first he visit Elizabeth of course the wife of the husband of Elizabeth and this man refused to believe the words of the Angel when he refused to believe that God said it's all right I will quickly pass over and go to another one and and this one while God was passing over this one remained dumb are you hearing me when God when the time of God has arrived amen you better have Revelation to see it because if you don't see it he he just leaves you he passes over you and when he passes over you he leaves you dumb he leaves you blind you can't see anymore and then he passed over this this one and he went over to his wife and told her all the secrets and later on we see that she's six months pregnant and of course we know how the story went that later on she gave birth to a boy and the man was still dumb until he wrote down on the paper the name the angel told him that's when God opened his M you see how it is important to discern the time you are living in to know what God is doing in that hour because if you don't you will be slothful yes and when you are slothful the angel will pass over and that's why many people have unanswered prayers because when God visited you were too busy you thought God should visit when you should want but God visits at the time list expect amen and and and this woman Elizabeth when a hard time came she was already engaged to a man she Lov but at that moment when the angel of the Lord came down and told her help Mary Mother help Mary they say mother of God but the angel did not say that said Hil Mary thou blessed among women and and then you know spoke to her and said she'll be pregnant with a child in a womb she said how will this things be she said the the the angel Gabriel said the holy spirit will overshadow you the spirit of God will overtake you now it was all confusing it had never happened before but this woman had a faith on Wednesday we talked about what faith this Faith was not half Faith amen go back and listen to the if you missed it it was not her faith we don't live by our faith we live by the faith of the Son of God you receive it as a gift of God Amen you know that's the same faith that um Peter received said Upon This Rock I will build my church and Byam told us this rock was Revelation and he said faith is a revelation I I know these things I'm going into somehow they are also deep Waters so I hope you are not expecting a a little Pentecostal message this morning God is maturing us we are stepping into those Waters where we should know what we believe and who we are and what we stand for praise the name of the Lord I'm happy to see you sister Angela so we see then that you know faith is a revelation of the will of God and without faith it is impossible to see God are you follow following me so then if without faith it is impossible to see God and faith is a revelation of the will of God it means Peter received that Revelation and there Peter had faith and upon that basis that faith God built his church on it and it is impossible to please God without that faith and that's the faith we're living by it is the faith of the Son of God it's not the faith that you walk up something and say now I feel Faith human Faith Can fail human faith will always fail actually but we are not living by our faith we are living by something that is gifted to us we did not even deserve it it is given to us by a Divine decree by Grace Grace oh Hallelujah Grace means unmerited favor we did not do something to Merit to Merit in ourselves or something to deserve but God looked upon me let me say it in personal God looked upon me and he had grace and grace upon me and he gave me that Faith simply that tell me what did Abraham do that made God call him Abraham was as bad as everybody else did you know that did you know that do you know did you even know that Abraham was drinking Abraham was as bad as the the rest he was not good at all but when God looked in the whole world he said I will go there and choose this man and I will call him out of there and I will set him on a I will set his life on a path and I will watch over him he will be mine and I will be his and we will walk together amen as long as he agrees so when he went down there he talked to him he gave him that Grace he gave him that Faith Abraham agreed Abraham accepted his time of his visitation and that was the beginning of great things a nation came out one who was burn amen gave birth to a child and a nation came out of it and the world has been blessed because of that One Nation I tell you it's the same with you amen God left others and he chose you he left another one he chose you let me first remove my thought Hallelujah hallu because when I talk about this amen I feel energized already amen God went around Amen in my family are you the only who was born in your family I ask you a question answer me are you the only member of your home Sister Rose were you the only one born of your father God mean in your family there were other children but God left this one and chose you left your big brothers and chose you left your small ones un chose you what am I trying to say Amen that you are unelect by according to Faith and if you are chosen by God how many believe they chosen of God if you are chosen of God God cannot choose you without a plan God chooses you when he has a plan God chose Abraham when he had a plan and Abraham accepted the moment Abraham accepted of God was activated amen people looked at Abraham they did not understand him but Abraham had a revelation not his own but a revelation from above Abraham saw something which others never saw Abraham saw a vision of his life Abraham saw where he was going Abraham changed his ways ABR his life Abraham walked in a different walk and from that moment God was leading him every step of the way I believe the same thing about my life I believe I am here because I am chosen of God Amen there is a path of life that I must walk and no man can close the door that God has opened for me no man can close the door that God has opened for you but how do you know it it is by faith and not by sight even if you don't see the door but you believe the door even if you don't feel the door but you see the door by faith Moses by faith Abraham by faith all the people that God talked about it was by by faith they they did great things by faith David by faith you know how what David did he killed a lion he killed a bear by faith you know talk about Samson it was by faith talk about all the Great Men you know David became a King by Faith all the men that God chose talk about Joshua talk about the talk about all the women of faith talk about Sarah talk about you know you know all these other women Hanah and others what was it by it was by faith they didn't see everything around them spoke to the opposite but amen but they were looking not to what they were seeing they were looking into what the word of God was saying for them there is something I'm trying to show you we are not just living beings that are born in the world to pass away the Bible actually says the works of the righteous they go ahead of them hallelujah amen we are here to live a life of a purpose we are here to represent what we were in the mind of God we are here and we leing by faith amen the many way many days the devil wanted to take us into accidents when we were coming from the East the car was parked and you know we were driving down a highway on a slop and then this man with a premium I think he just came driving and he turned and he stopped in the middle of Road and we were coming on that and there was another huge coming and there was just a small Gap friends if you would turn the car would flee our car would flee so we couldn't turn we just had to go head on and by going head on it means we would knock this man even if we turn and byass him the other one would would just hit a so why am I here all I know all I know the angel of the Lord was right there because I don't know how we negotiated that corner but I know he carried us we would have died we should have died but we cannot die until the purpose of God Amen has been accomplished and I tell you what brother there are many things that have wanted to take us even sin a life of sin a life of defeat things we born in and you thought you were going to go you thought it was going to take you but God cannot permit it until his time appointed has come for you and therefore we know we right in the word of God when you receive this Revelation you stop woring about your life amen you live a life of joy you live a life of Peace amen you are not worried what the devil will do because you know what comes what goes my life is in your hands you are leading me into the paths I must amen I have no fear for Jesus walks beside me praise the name of the Lord amen even when you are poor even when you have no tution even when you have no job you are not worried about anything am I preaching to Believers this morning you are not worried about anything Hallelujah and so today I want us to take another turn and look at when he comes when the time is right what does it do and we will take it by this Parable he says a certain man had a great supper and he called many I want you to see what happens when he sends out invitations Jesus Christ is not like us here in Uganda who make a wedding and send out invitations and we call 100 people and 200 people show up and then people begin fighting for food because they have no they were not accounted Heaven some of you who FL food here in heaven you will not FL you need an invitation tell your neighbor you need an invitation hallelujah amen amen he B many and Jesus also has told many and he sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready if you are receiving this this morning God is going to take you to a higher level Faith open your heart and let us see what the whole Spirit has you see saath time is the last not so what happens on a wedding first it is a ceremony it takes place where where where where does the wedding ceremony take place at church wedding ceremony takes place at church after the wedding ceremony then you are announced married and then now you can now prepare and go to the marriage supper are you following me after the marriage supper then now from there you you go to the honeymoon the ones who are married now we've already gone through these processes the ones who are about to get married you going to go through it so but let us look at our spiritual now our wedding our marriage with Jesus Christ happens where at church while you hearing this words and you believing it you are getting married to we have passed the level of Engagement we are no longer just engag to Jesus Christ we are now married to him when someone just comes in church they get engaged so we have others who still at some other levels they are still in courtship with Jesus others have not even known him yet there are different levels we call it maturity but then you find that there are others who are engaged by being filled with the Holy Ghost but then you find there others who are even at another level amen of adoption now amen whereby they now are no longer called just engaged but they are called the wife of Jesus Christ have already been pronounced by the servant by the preacher that's what the prophet of a generation comes to do he comes to pronounce the marriage and then after that we go to the marriage supper as individuals others at different levels but generally speaking as a church the Church of Jesus Christ has no long moved away from courtship has now long moved away from engagement the church is married to Christ we are one with the word we are word Believers Bible Believers we are now one with the word and when we become one with the word the only thing remaining is the marriage supper of the Lamb that is yet to come the invitations have been Sav many have been called amen and he says supper time is here I also want to tell you supper time is here very many people don't know but I want to say believer supper Time Is Here supper Time Is Here we no longer have time to waste how many want to eat not just here but to go over there and eat with him at time praise the name of the Lord friends we see that after that comes the mill the the the uh we call the Millennium but it's the hyon if you are going to go to Hon who choose who decides some people they discuss but I know the man decides but I know the man decides to take the wife where he knows she will be very happy right they even talk about sometimes before marriage I will take you to Mombasa I will take you to Golden Tulip I will take you to Sera I'll take you I don't know whether this young people have been taking each other somewhere going somewhere for for some few days where do you think our lord Jesus will take us where do you think he will take us okay now let me tell you Heaven is where our supper is going to be but our honeymoon will not be in heaven our honeymon is going to be in a place where the devil thought amen we under his feet where a place where we were tried a place where we once lived as defeated a place where the devil tried all he could to destroy us amen our our husband is going to build a pal that same place amen and he will bring us down with all his glory and we should live in that place our honeymon is going to be on earth we are going to live down here and we are going to rule with him for a space of 1,000 years we shall not serve we shall be sered we will be in our hon but now he's talking about the supper he's saying at supper Focus here they said to them that we been come for all things are now ready and they all with one conent began to make excuses they began making excuses and one said I bought a piece of ground I must go and see it and another one said I have about five yoke of oxen must go and prove them and another said I have married a wife and there I cannot come all these excuses for people who don't want to serve God for people who don't want to come to the marriage but here is what the master said he said he was very angry he became very angry and he said go out quickly because his tables were set because his marriage supper was set right now we are eating a spiritual supper the revealed word of the hour we are eating a spiritual supper right now and he has invited everyone to come but very all the ones that have been invited to come have turned it down and then he turned to the servant and he said go out quickly into the streets and Lanes of the city and bring in hether the poor the maed the hold the Blind and the servant said Lord it is done as thou Hast commanded and yet there is room a prophet here in questions on the seals he says would the of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture because we've had a people who actually now say and please I want you to be in the same spirit with me says that they are going to be you know after brother Branham there is no more preachers they are saying we should only put tis in church and there should be no preach how many have heard of that uhuh how many have not heard of it okay they are saying we should not go and listen to a preacher because brother Bram is the prophet of Our Generation how many believe brother bam is the prophet of Our Generation we sure all believe that William Marion Bram William Mar Bram is Malachi 4 fulfilled no one can replace that that scripture is already fulfilled but here he was asked the question would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture and he said that's what is going on right now it is the message of the hour is the bride of Christ she is she consists of Apostles Prophets teachers evangelists pastors that's the bride of Christ she's got a Ministry a great ministry the ministry of the hour and then he says it will be so humble so now there is a Ministry amen that comes near or close to supper time but it's going to be a very humble Minister but also a very great minister I want you to imagine this it's going to be great but yet humble why because it's a Ministry of the Bride amen it consists of Apostles teachers Apostles evangelist prophet and he says here in the Philadelphian Church age it is to this age that Jesus says I come quickly that makes the last age a very short one laia is the age of the quick work it is cut short you know when God has reached a time of doing something God is always fast it comes to individuals is fast fast fast fast we have seen it we have tried to see it in several scriptures but now today in this service I want us to see in a way or in a perspective of a whole generation in the last age there is no other AG coming generation we are in now it is is the last generation the Gentile church has seven generations how many them the first one come on say it say it out loud out loud number one epes number two is this a message believer chur number two God bless I don't know whoever said that number three number three H uh number three number three what is the third Church H pamos is that correct number four number four F I wish we had time to talk about each of those but let me give it to you briefly just briefly I don't I'm not going to go into the whole details because I want us to get perspective the first church age well before the before the Jews before the Gentiles God was working with the Jews can you say Amen to that and the Jews were the ones that Jesus went to they were the ones that were waiting for him they were the ones that were waiting for the Messiah the Gentiles we did not know we were living in darkness but here in the Book of Romans chapter 11 let me just give you this background here for you to know what I'm talking about I want you to go to Romans chapter 11 everybody open there if you can please and I want us to read um okay verses 20 I'm trying to see okay let me just read in English and then if you're reading luganda follow me because of time I want to read a few verses and I want to bring to bring it out all out so follow me closely from vers 13 for I speak I speak to you Gentiles in as much as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles I magnify mine office this is Apostle Paul speaking if by any means I may provoke to ulation them which are my flesh and might save some of them for if the casting away of them meaning the Jews be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead for if the first fruit be holy the lamp is also holy for if the root be holy so also are the branches and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild Olive Tree W grafted in among them and with them partak of the root and the fatness of the Olive Tree burst not against the branches but if thou burst thou bearest not the root but the root uh but the root thee 19 thou will say then the branches were broken off that I might be Graft in well because of the of unbelief they were broken off the D test by faith be not highminded but fear for if God spare not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee now verses 24 for if thou W cut out of the Olive Tree which is Wild by nature and were grafted contrary to the nature into a good Olive Tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree for I would not bre that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own Concepts that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in now I want us to learn and understand we we should know what we believe all right can you now tell your neighbor I want you to know what you be I ask you to do that so you can activate your mind okay now listen closely Jesus Christ is is saying here is the Olive Tree and now the the the the Jews the Jewish Church were the the branches the original branches on that tree but because they stopped believing they you know when pet rather when Paul went to preach to them they refused to believe the word and they began you know confusing and refusing and all that and so Peter I mean Paul from that moment he told them seeing that you count yourselves Unworthy of eternal life it was good the gospel came among you first but you have counted yourself unworthy said L we turn to the Gentiles it was at that moment it would have been good if you put up that scripture can't read all the scriptures from that moment in the book of Acts the the the Jewish church was blinded as I speak to you today if you go to Israel the Jews don't believe in Jesus Christ as the Messiah they don't ah they don't believe it they believe in the Old Testament laws those who are religious the rest are atheists they're just there they don't believe in God they living in fields and all that what happened they living in blindness but while they are blind God decided by the ministry of apostle Paul to go to the Gentiles and now from the time of apostle Paul until today the gospel is among the Gentiles who are the Gentiles the Gentiles is everyone that is not Jew all the continents of the world they are Gentiles and we see we are Gentiles you are Gentiles your brother's sister Gentiles so what is it they were cut off they were the original Branch because of unbelief they were cut off and then God took went into the the forest he went into the bush and found another tree and cut off a branch from there and brought it and joined it to this one where the other one was Hallelujah and the other one was abandoned and now the one which is on the Olive Tree is the Gentile Branch who is that that is presenting the Gentile church but here has say you also the Gentiles don't begin boasting the root is not the one that you are not holding yourself rather it is the root holding you the life we have is not ours it is the Life of Christ is the one bearing us he's the one holding us he said don't boast don't boast because also you if he was not able to spare the original what about you who are not even original he will cut you off and then he will bring back the other one as long as they are not in unbelief but here he said when will that happen he has given us a timeline do you understand what I'm talking about he has given us a timeline and he said when he said when the times he says the the Gentile dispensation is over okay let let us read it together quickly he says vers 25 are you there if you're there brother give you to us on the screen I want this is now learning and I want all of to follow I don't want to be so fast and I Leave You verses 25 what did he say for I would not Brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery um lest you should be wise in your own conscience that blindness in part is happen to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be coming you can read it praise the name of the Lord so he's saying now here that the Jews are going to be blind blind blind until the fullness of the Gentiles come are you hearing me now most of the denominations are just they are Gentiles you know oh my there are many types here that are coming to me let me pull out one then I come back to we see Joseph Joseph was a type of Christ you know how he was rejected by his Brethren the Jews they rejected him they cast him away and then the Gentiles the Egyptians the Gentiles they embraced him and when they took him you know he became a great man among them do you know what he became he became almost an emperor he was a prince among the Gentiles he was respected he was even given you know the responsibility of taking care of corn in other words he was the master of the Harvest Hallelujah we are reading is deep I want you to follow me and understand take not if you can you know Joseph so he became the master of the Harvest he was no longer a common so when like like like like Joseph Jesus was rejected among the Jews they told him because pilot told them who should I kill Barabas oh Jesus who should I release everybody shouted baras baras they chose Barabas instead of Jesus and he said what about Jesus he said they said who the Jews let his blood be upon us and our children and the man washed his hands and he he gave them the license to go and crucify him so they began beating and then he went and they crucified him they rejected Christ in Broad de and by rejecting him you know what he did he also left them you know the Gentiles received him hallelujah amen when you go to America when you go to Canada when you go to Australia when you come in Africa when you go all over the world in India everywhere Jesus is on the top we have received him we have worshiped him we glorify his name we have even sung songs about him we have prayed to him we have done everything in his name because to us he is a Prest Hallelujah while in Israel is not revealed as we do here they are blind but Jesus has said here in his word they are not going to be blind forever there is coming a time when their blindness will come to an end but when will that time be when the fullness of the Gentiles has come in when that fullness comes in then he will come amen back to the Jews we see Joseph when his brothers came you remember when his brothers came and showed up he told them this is another good time he told them you go bring your my your last brother they they had to go and bring the little Joseph what sorry sorry little Benjamin I no I made a mistake there they they had to go for little benjam and and as little Benjamin what does it represent these things are prophetic by the way follow closely little Benjamin represents the elect from among the Jews just like we have an elect from among the Gentiles there is also an elect from among the Jews and they will be numbered even 144,000 Jews and they are coming out of each tribe so he told them I will not reveal myself to you my brothers they never knew of course he was even their brother I will not reveal myself to you I will not give you food that's what he say until your little brothers come also what what does that type Jesus is not going to go back to the [Music] Jews until all the 144,000 Jews have been restored first physically the Jews have all have they were all over the world they had to come back in their Homeland physically living in Jerusalem in Israel that will be the time for him to reveal himself to the Jews oh the Bible says there will be a Prophet come and and their name is one is Moses another one is Elijah they will come to them they preach to them Christ but before he reveals himself to them do you remember what he did he did one thing that was very significant here is what it did he went to his wife and his children and told them there is something I'm going to do go in the palace the and then he came and revealed himself to said I am Joseph that's exactly what is going to happen Jesus Christ is our Joseph amen before he reveals himself to the Jews before he goes back to Israel he's going to Amen to take the the bride into the palace amen Joseph Married An Egyptian wife Jesus married a gentile wife we are the wife of Jesus we are not everyone hey we are royal we are married to him said you are Miss Jesus Christ and before he goes back to Israel amen there is a group you will have to account for that's the bride he will tell them come on go in the palace go in the palace to do up to the marriage sh of the Lamb Hallelujah we shall go there while he going now to Israel but during that time it will also be tribulation to the to the rest of the world there will be a Great Tribulation period we see that all the people will begin to receive the mark matter of fact they already receiv receiving it the mark of the beast and those who have it they will not be persecuted that much but those who don't have it will be persecuted killed some of them many of those will be the foolish virgins but now before all that happens he knows that is where it is going he says that until the fullness of the Gentiles be com how does it come in it comes in through seven ages seven ages seven ages es of the same church we call it seven Church ages seven Gentile Church ages amen we have the first one as e each of these age was signifying something and a matter of fact what I will tell you is that U these were cities in in Asia Minor over here and um each of them was very significant towards the future ages of the church and that's why God used these names of these cities or the churches in these cities to represent the fullness of the gentle church so when you look at Ephesus Ephesus meant aimed at and then laxed it was the first age you know full of the realities of the truth and the word and we see that these people really loved God they had the word was so pure but we see that that's also when the wrong seed was swn and like I said I'll just give you a tip of the iceberg I not go into the details and then Paul was the messenger but then camea as a matter of fact the word SMA comes from two [Music] words because m is a substance which was used to embalm the dead so this shows that uh uh it was also bitter so we we see that the church at that time started to experience that bitterness as as first Doctrine started taking root and um and and you know uh the uh the Bible actually speaks of you know this speed of the speed of nicolan we talked about it some back and uh also oh my sometimes I realize we don't get into these things there is a time in the lockdown we went through the church ede book page by Page and we were able to go through these Church ages one by one by one and so as I'm going through this I feel like I'm not doing it [Music] justice and I'm encouraging you if you can take the church ede book and read it but let me ask before we continue how many have read the church AG how many have not be raise up your hand you're going to see brother done here he going to make sure every one of you who doesn't have it gets it and read it because I don't have to rehearse these things soana was the second age and um and and then came pamos this is where the church got married to the state the false Doctrine is taking a hold the trity teaching and and you know and all these other false doctrines they started there wrong baptisms then camea speaking of the dominating female that is the spirit of the false Church dominating the whole world actually you know it already what's the biggest church in the world they are the ones who teach the wrong doctr the Bible speaks of it in the Book of Revelation 17 and says she's drunken with the blood of the Saints I'm all over the place today let's uh look at that it says and a woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and the precious stones and and Pearls having golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and fithness of her fornication [Music] the Bible says the filth of her fornication what is this filth what is this fornication the filth is the wrong teachings that are being given to people that's now they they're made to fornicate with those false doctrin this is spiritual fornication what they baptism of babies it's a filth of our fornication what are they baptism in the Trinity believing in three Gods what are they the FI of a forication and has made the whole world to drink from that cup filled with a fith of our fornication what are these teachings you know women preacher and they say it's all right and yet the Bible says it's not it's the fness of our fornication what are these teachings you know you have seen those scapular that they say if you wear this one even if you die after killing someone you go straight to Purgatory that is the filth of our fornication there is nothing like purgatory [Applause] our is here on Earth because the word comes from the world PGE means to cleanse to wash toy so they believe that when you die and you go to hell a priest will come after they have given him money he will light some candles he will pray some prayers and your soul will be taken from hell and will be brought to Purgatory not heaven but also not hell in the middle middle there there but that's false teachings is the fithness of our fornication Hallelujah we believe our patory is here where we are being washed where we are being cleansed where we are being purified and after we die we know we are where we are going we are going in the presence of God praise the name of the Lord and and we see that they have told those things and and people are thirsty and hungering for the word but that Spirit you know fill the whole world during it filled the whole world during the age of 30 that is when they would even kill people physically for not being part of their assist praise the name of the Lord and then came sadis and after sadis came philadel a great missionary age and now we have passed all those ages we have reached now laia is the last age of the gentle church and we are here inia the marriage supper if Jesus Was preparing the marriage supper it is now already everything is finished the time is at the end the time for the Gentiles is over anytime soon the Rapture trumpet shall sound and he said and and and the people gave excuse es they refus they said will not come will not come will not come but then he turned to the servant and told him go quickly into the streets and lands and the city what I wanted to impress upon you this morning is brethren we have a message we are not just another church we are not just another fellowship we are not just trying to make a denomination no we are beyond that we have a message this is what is consuming us we have a message amen and this message amen is preparing the people to go in the Rapture to go in the marriage St of the lamb and it is an Urgent Message there is no time to waste let go quickly if others won't come if the if the the anglicans won't come if the Adventist won't come if the Pentecostal won't come if all those good religious people won come they were all invited he said go out quickly go out quickly to the streets and the lands and the city and bringing he of the poor the maed the old the Blind by the way I believe with all my heart this message has come for the lowest people this message has come for the people who feel they are nothing for the message for the people who feel they are no bodies Hallelujah because God Specializes in making nobody somebody God takes the rejected God takes the sinful God T the M God Tes the heartbroken and he he changes them he converts them some he makes them preachers some he makes them women of God wives of pastors makes them let me tell you Brethren if you believe this message with all your heart it should set you on fire it should change every part of your life it should change your mind amen even your Ambitions even your Ambitions every one of them should change I don't know about you but since I believe this message I've noticed I've been changing I've been changed my mind has been changed because I'm being prepared for something greater than money for something greater than a system we are not just here to have church we are here to prepare ourselves for the coming of the Lord whatever we are doing brethren we should do it urgently we should do it fast there is no time to waste it's going to be a quick work a and quick work soon and very soon he's going back to the Jews and he will leave the Gentiles in their false doctrines in their ISS and all those carons you find them dancing in their churches saying they're dancing to Jesus but they rejected him long ago and he has already got his own he has already got his own from the streets where did you come from he picked me from the streets Oh Glory to God oh glory to God that's why you young men you must be on fire to take this message out why is it that there are no more younger men preaching on the streets in this message what is happening many of them are dead let me tell you if what you have you are so busy you can't talk about it to others there is death somewhere death has coming in you should be on fire you should go out quickly I believe in Street evangelism even the sisters I don't believe you should go take a Bible and preach but I believe you should go take tracks and give to your neighbors and witness to a friend you young man go take a Bible stand on thead side make sure they are people don't stand like those people who stand in the town when one taxi passes they hear G another he another he Jesus Jesus no and they are saying that evangelism no go in a center where the people are there take a microphone okay if you have no microphone go in a center where you know the B bers will be there and the mama will be there when they selling something are you hearing Church go right there I've done it before I can still do it I still do it let me tell you Brethren go right on on that place oh brother are you not ashamed Are you ashamed of Christ Are you ashamed of them when they going to burn go and warn them go and bring them to the feast and you are saying you're a Believer you you you are spending all your time on social media spending on things that don't count this is an Urgent Message it is calling us to an action oh brother go on the streets if you feel you have a calling upon your life don't wait for the next time the pastor I will ask you to come and preach no no no no no Amen brother Brian go right there on the street amen go and pull out your Bible God teach them about water baptism are you hearing me how many are with me this morning brother Dixon don't wait for anyone to send you when you hear the voice of the bridegroom Amen brother Alan you will go you will stand you will preach they will believe they will come in and there will be the shining stars in your [Music] crown it's an Urgent Message he says all things are now ready do we believe all things are now ready ah Malachi 45 says behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the Great and the Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth this prophecy is fulfilled John the Baptist fulfill the first portion which says he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children what does that mean the fathers here is talking of the the the fathers of the law the ones who believed in the Lord the ones who submitted themselves to the Lord the phes and sedes John's Ministry turned their hearts to Children meaning Christ because Jesus was just a child and his faith was like that that he said is like that of Little Children he said that the kingdom of God is like an little child and if you do not be like a child you will never inherit the kingdom of God so he came like that in humility and this Pharisees John preached to them repent the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and by so doing he turned the hearts of the fathers to Christ and then we see from the law to Grace but then the Bible continues on when he says and also the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth to the if this doesn't happen the whole world would be cast don't listen to someone who tells you Elijah Ministry is not important because the Bible is saying if Elijah does not come and turn the children the hearts of the children to the Father the whole world will be cast imagine do you remember someone else who gave a cur it was Paul he said if anyone teach another gospel then what we have preached to you let him be Cur so there are many preachers today who are under a curse for preaching teachings that Paul never preached if they support women preachers if they baptize wrong if they don't believe in the things that they don't believe in one God they literally under that c and so you see why this Prophet had to come is to hinder people from going under that Cur because the ministry of Elijah will restore all things he says here he shall turn the hearts of the children to their fathers so today we are the children of God we are the children of God our hearts have been turned to our fathers our fathers are those ones who were once who children now and they grew and became our fathers the apostles so we are turned back to the faith of the Apostles back to the teachings of Peter back to the teachings of Paul back to all the original faith and and the Elijah Ministry is coming to turn our hearts back in Matthew 17:10 and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must and Jesus answered and said unto them's truly shall first come and restore all things and I also want to say Eliah truly has come already tell your neighbor Elias has come already amen Elijah is come already all things are ready now someone didn't get it because Jesus said go out quickly because all things are ready now the time for the marriage supper said go out quickly call them and when they didn't come you know he told okay go to the streets call the name call the poor call everybody and he said we have done it and here they are and I can say here they are we have come but then he said and yet there is room there's a song we used to sing if you know it you can sing it with me room room yes there's room there's room found for thee Oh room room yes there is room there's a room at the fountain for thee there is room for everyone that can come in hallelujah amen and while I want to conclude not the sermon but just the service today you know he says here Elijah elah truly shall first come and restore all things and I said to you today that Elijah Ministry was fulfilled in the ministry of William Elijah has come if you believe it your amens would have been much better than that hallelujah amen we are a bunch of people who believe that Elijah has come amen and all things are now ready because when he comes he will restore all things he set the church in order the right teaching on the godhead the right teaching on Holiness the right teaching on the church ages on the ministry the order the gifts everything the everything is now ready the ground has been set amen I'm thinking of the Rapture in blessed the only thing remaining is for the bride to go to the marriage supper but just before we go there is just a little more room
