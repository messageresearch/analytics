Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; That's all, pastor. Sorry, &gt;&gt; I have forgotten something. Mama. Oh, &gt;&gt; I have something for you. My dear, love is beautiful. Um, just a disclaimer, I do not tell these young people what to do, what not to do. There are some people have jealousy Sometimes they come and say, "Pastor, why do you let them splash the love to us like that?" &gt;&gt; I believe love is part of life. And if it's not built in church, you want it to be built in the bar, this is the right place. Amen. and and so personally I have no problem with the young people expressing themselves as long as it is genuine from so join me let us pray for them you just remain standing a precious heavenly father I have here brother Enoch and u a lovely sister here that he has chosen to walk this path of life. And Lord, we have witnessed his promises to her and the token of engagement on her on a on a finger. Lord Jesus, we know that love starts with you because you are the author of it. You yourself, you are love. For the Bible says, God is love. Father, we know it was sanctioned by you in the book of Genesis in the in the Garden of Eden. And he that does not love does not have God. And Father, Lord, you've given love to these two each other. And as they desire to start this life's journey together, you commit them into your heart. And Lord as even they have announced their engagement today we Lord as your children and as your servant want to stand witnesses to that as we ask and sanction your blessing upon them that you will keep them and watch over them until their wedding day. We give you thanks and pronounce them engaged. Amen. God bless you. Uh wait um remain standing there. Sister Merci here is from Lifeboat Church &gt;&gt; and um I I'm just hearing for my first time where they found each other. I did not know it was in our youth meetings, but um he introduced her to me and we talked and I sent them over to the pastor of the girl as well and we've been in communication with pastor Robert as well &gt;&gt; and they've met the parents. He has his with his family. They've met the parents and had agreements that they can proceed and do their engagement today. And so when is your uh introduction ceremony 29th November. Looks like this year the ending of this year is going to really God bless you. God bless you, brother. Amen. Amen. Um we just had um who engaged last Sunday? Someone remind me who was it? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, it was Monica brother now. Ah okay. You like hiding behind the pillars. So, uh, God bless you, brother Sadat. I do not know that you're going to be around today or so. We have their wedding coming up now. These one, these ones as well. And wait for more. I'm telling you, everybody's going to be married. I was not joking when I said it. I was not joking when I said last time that if we have a few in the pipeline, but we've been busy. You know when you see a person getting married it's not been easy a lot of time with them to do counseling and so um we just pray that God will bless and provide for everyone that is planning to get married and uh it's hard as a little church but you have to support each of them really try your best and support each other. Is that a myth? Amen. So, there's more coming. Let's just keep it in prayer. Also, I just came back from evening light right now. We usually have their morning service a little earlier. So, we minister to them this morning. Pastor brother Gava sent you greetings and the whole church there. Shall we stand on our feet? We go to Psalms 42. And as uh we are going into the word, &gt;&gt; I just wanted to um let you know that on t on Tuesday. &gt;&gt; Uh I received pastor Tom, the pastor of Bible way in Canada &gt;&gt; and brother Tom. brother brother Michael rather uh we received them and we were with them on uh on on Thursday and on on on uh Friday then on Saturday yesterday they were at it somewhere in Sa and today they are in um in and they'll be back here and we will be with them on Wednesday night. We &gt;&gt; we will have a service and it will be started a little earlier and that will be about 5:00 p.m. So if you could try and come earlier, these are people who have traveled more than 27 hours. many places they can be around the world. But being that we are going to have them in this little place, it's a honor. So uh come and be here and all of you come and those who have not come today inform them to come. We have some ministers coming from three regions of Uganda and so you don't you want to come and help me host them. Uh this church has been very supportive in the mission work really I can say that they made me what I am today because the the pastor the found of that work pastor Tim uh pastor Eddie Biscaris who now has gone to be with the Lord really was my mentor. in the so we've worked with them for many years. Um so we also worked with them in Ethiopia and other places. So more will be spoken on that Wednesday. Come and be here and let us see what the Lord will do for us. Psalms 42 vers 1 to7. As the heart panteth after the water brook, so pantth my soul after thee, oh God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my meat and day and night. While they continually say unto me, "Where is thy God?" When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me. I pour out my soul in me. For I had gone with the multitude. I went with them to the house of God with a voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holy day. Why art thou cast down, oh my soul, and why art thou disquened in me? Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance, oh my God, my soul is cast down within me. Therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and and and of the Hmonites, from the hill of Misar. Deep calleth unto deep at a no at the noise of thy water spouts. All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Amen. Let us pray. Loving Jesus, we would like to commit uh this moment now in your hands. Lord, may you cause us to have divine inspiration in preaching, receiving also. Let everybody that is under the sound of my voice today. Let us be so captivated by the word and may we not leave this place the same. We give you thanks in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Please be seated. I'm speaking to you this morning on a subject or the subject the deep calleth unto the deep. Nice to see uh brother. He's been away for a while. Our prophet brother Bham preached on this subject. The deep calleth unto the deep. Brother, are you able to show our website here? You you know it. Can you try if you have? Do you have internet? Um, so if you go on our website, one of the pages there, I think I'll take as one of the days on a Sunday and I show you because many of you don't know. We now have a new website and uh quite a lot of information is there. We are even trying to uh put a lot of subjects and you know on on the on what we believe for you to be able to um to to to to read that and maybe share it with your friends. Um so there is this page called the messenger and on that page you will find that sermon the deep call it through the deep you have it no okay so I will show you I'll prepare and show you it to you in one of the services and Um you know u to those of you who don't know the website is called dvf fellowship.org dvf fellowship dot &gt;&gt; dv fellowship dvf fellowship.org &gt;&gt; Yes. So if you go there and then you go to the page called the messenger begin with a question who was William Marian Brham to talk about the pill of fire to talk about you know that give you that 57 minute sermon called the deep calleth to And we'll also give you the interview. Some people interviewed him uh regarding his ministry and it's called a 20th century prophet. The title of that video is called a 20th century. And these people who did this uh video interview were not even believers of this message. But somehow they wanted they called him the 20th century prophet because they noticed his ministry was extraordinary. And there's also some eyewitness accounts there on that page. Yeah. So there's a lot there. So but um I'm not exactly going to speak what he spoke but maybe uh but I just pray that the Holy Spirit will lead us today. Are you ready for the what? Ask your neighbor, are you ready for the what did they say? &gt;&gt; They ready. &gt;&gt; Okay. So if you are ready, I want to hear your amen. So these words were written by David. See, David was expressing a spiritual experience, not just an emotion, but a yearning, you know, a deep within him for God. He said, "As the heart panteth after the water brooks, so pantth my soul after thee, oh God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God." There was something inside him crying. Something in him was crying for something that was outside. And that thing outside was the presence of the living God. If you are like David, a real son of God, a real daughter of God, you are going to have a punting, a desire within you. Not just for religion, but for a living God. A God that does miracles. A God that makes impossible things possible. A God that can provide you a job. A God that can give you the desire of your heart. A God that can fill your thirst or your hunger in your heart. You see um in the message expectation the prophet of God says I believe David said when the deep callth to the deep If there is a deep calling uh there is a deep to respond to somewhere. If there is a deep in you calling there is a deep somewhere to respond to that deep. You have heard a brother Enoch saying he had a deep in him calling and he went everywhere looking. Why did he go looking? Because there was someone somewhere waiting. So if there is a deep in you calling for something, there is something somewhere to satisfy that longing you have in your life. Amen. In other words, I've said now, oh, my sound is awful today. if you can help me brothers. You see um and by the way we are trying to uh I just wanted to say this we we need to buy a new mixer try to look at you know we need several millions for those things. So if you want to support work with us on that please all right now let's continue here. Praise God. Praise God. So, in other words, as I've often said, before there was a fin on a fish's back, there had to be a water first for him to use that fin in or he wouldn't have the fin. If there is a a tree to grow on the earth, there has to be an earth for it to grow or there would be no tree. So if there is something in you that calls out, I'm now in another message. as the ego stirs up on us. If there is something in you that calls out, there is something in you that longs for God. You know, you can be living in a life that is not right. You can be doing something that you know is wrong. But you feel there is a yearning in you to be better. So something in you that calls for God and you try to satisfy that thirst that's in you. You know as David said as the heart thirst after the water brook so my soul thirst after thee. Oh God and brother Bham says and you try to satisfy that blessed holy thirst. that God put in you to thirst after him and you try to satisfy it with the things of the world. But the difference we satisfy that thirst differently. You try to satisfy, you know, when you're thirsty, you try and and and find water. Imagine if you're so thirsty and they give you soda. You drink, but you don't feel they give you, they give you porridge. I'm looking for something. That thing must be there. The original must be there. If there are many things to try and help you quench that thirst, but they're not helping you, then that real thing must be there. The real water must be there. So if you're thirsting for God, don't settle for anything else. Keep looking. Keep searching because there is a living God that satisfies our thirst. Praise God. Amen. He says the devil is trying to make you quench that thirst by serving him. When you are a eagle, you was born to be an eagle and you have no right to quench that thirst with the things of the world. God gave you that thirst to thirst after him. Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst. For righteousness, for they shall be. So if you have a thirst, there is something to feel. Hallelujah. Every spiritual longing in the soul of a believer is an echo for God is called. If you have any longing in your heart, there is a call. That thirst is trying to respond to that call. How do you know your body needs water? God naturally put in you something that will make you understand that the body system needs um water and it is called thirst. If you do not give your body water, you will get constipation. Constipation. And when you get constipation, you can even get a surgery. It is serious. It's not small. It's a big thing. Thirst. You have to respond to that. If you get thirst and say well I must not drink water I am okay then you are ignoring the very thing that is going to help you. We have seen that even science tells us you are supposed to drink water before you become thirsty. The body needs water naturally. Praise God. So you must drink water regularly in certain amounts at certain times. But if you don't and you ignore other will give you a call and tell you hey you need water. But if you don't drink that water then you'll become sick. So now what is that fast? It's a call is to tell you hey there is something needed down here. But you see you cannot thirst for something that does not exist. You thirst for something that is already provided. So you see the deep in you responds to the deep in God. Hallelujah. Whatever God wants to give you. By the way, how do you know? By the end of this sermon, you will know this. How do you know that God wants to give you something? He gives you a thirst. When the deep calls, it's not mere religion. It's destiny. answering to its source. Why are you here this morning? You may some of you came even when you don't want. Some of you felt like I didn't charge but still you are here. Why? Can you answer me? Come on, answer me. Why are you here? Even to some of you who were forced by somebody, but you came. I didn't call you. I didn't talk to you. I didn't beg you to come. But you came because there is a thirst in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are hungering for something. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Brother, look, I audio is not good today. &gt;&gt; But I have decided to abandon to like ignore that &gt;&gt; because there's something I want to deliver. &gt;&gt; I don't want anything to stand in the way of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen. &gt;&gt; Why am I here? Why am I seeking after God? Because I there's a deep calling. There must be a deep somewhere to respond. And let me tell you, you can never force someone to receive God. You can never do that. I can never force you to believe. You believe because you have a thirst. If someone doesn't have hunger, you can cook them fish and and and and rice and everything. It will not it will be like I'm not interested. No appetite, no appetite is a sign of sickness. If you've been treating someone and they begin to become well, tell me what is the first thing they ask for? Then you know ah they're becoming better because you see the hunger is showing the system is going back to normal and when they don't want anything is a sign of sickness. Now spiritually speaking it is the same thing we have. If you have a hunger for God, if you have a thirst after the things of God, brother, that's the God's way of calling you, of telling you, you are my son. You are my child. I want to feel you. If you have a thirst for prayer, how many have ever had a thirst for prayer? Okay, you see how many have never had be sincere. Amen. Okay. No one has never or some of you don't know actually what it is. Can someone who knows come and tell us what is the thirst for prayer? How many have ever had it? I want to call someone. Come brother come. Have you ever heard it? How how is the Have you ever had thirst for water? How is the thirst for water? &gt;&gt; Give him the microphone. &gt;&gt; You find your throat is like drying. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And you feel like &gt;&gt; You feel like you need to take water. &gt;&gt; You feel like you need to take water. How do you know it is water you want and not soda? Because even if you take any other things, it can't make it. You will try to take soda you you can't even take it but he has said you will feel you are not satisfied right what about the for prayer of prayer for me always when some situation is has come my way just come pray pray when you pray something happen immediately You see now many people when the thirst godly divine thirst comes they do not mind about satisfying that thirst. They let it pass. They let it pass. And that's why you are getting spiritual. The the call comes pray. You don't pray. You don't pray. Read the word. Read the word. You ignore it. You don't read the word. It's a call. If if if there is something, you know, you you don't know but you feel a hunger. Go to church. Fast. Do this. you know, seek after after righteous, repent, seek more of God, read the word, desire for the things of God. And you know, we always receive that call, but we dismiss it. And whenever you dismiss it, you have just dismissed the uh provision from God. When God wants to give you something, he will put that desire in you. When God created man, he breathed into him his own life. Now, Zoe is the nature of God. Now, we lost this life. But when we are born again, we have that very nature of God again right in us. So inside the elect is not just human desire is a seed gene of God that longs to return to his origin. Have you ever seen a man that has thirst for cigarette? You know if a person has a thirst for cigarette you cannot try to stop them you can't tell them to quit no man can quit cigarette except with the help of God and so is any other addiction you know someone will be there but when they become nervous and then you'll get a cigarette Why? Because it's a thirst within them is a nature that longs for it. So you see the real nature of God in the child in the in the heart of a child of God is to long for the things of God. And what what the devil does, he replaces that longing and he tries to make us thirst after the things of the world. But the thirst is genuine. But the devil perverts the thirst. And I'm not talking about something that is from another planet. I'm talking about the realistic things because each of us thus and that's why you find someone addicted to something that they do it. What are they looking for? They are looking for satisfaction. But after they do it, they are not satisfied. There is still a void. Why? Because that's not the real thing. You drink soda, you drink, you drink, you drink all this, it cannot help until you find a real water. That's why a true son or daughter of God cannot be satisfied with church programs only. you know just getting a position in church or just religion there is something deeper in our heart that is crying out that's why we are not in the Catholic church this morning we are not in some of these you know uh churches we have come in this little place not because it's more beautiful than all the others but there is something here that satisfies us differently than what the other things can satisfy us. Whenever we come and hear the word, you know, we feel satisfied. Amen. Praise God. I remember my mama told me last time because uh one of her fathers was um a a priest &gt;&gt; in the Catholic church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so she went there in in the you know when when he died and you know there were just you know very many fathers and brothers and more people would come and so now they this was like how do they call the mass. So now they started he started they started preaching but she told me as she heard them talk she could feel that no one is satisfied not even herself and surely those people are suffering there's a lot of famine of the word and that's why we should thank God for this precious end time message because when you hear the word. You feel satisfied. Lord, I want more of you. Something cries out. Not more of the word, not more entertainment, more of your presence, more of your word, more of your power. You know, David said, "I fast, my heart thirst for a living God." I want you to see here in Ecclesiastes 3 11 says he has made everything beautiful in his time also he has set the world in their heart and that is now KJV I want you to hear it in the amplified he has made everything beautiful and appropriate in his time in his He has also planted. Now, now listen, listen. There's a season. Now, please listen to me with one heart. Now, you see everything God makes it beautiful in its time. There's time for everything. So when it's time for something, you will know it's the time. &gt;&gt; He has also planted eternity which you said a sense of divine purpose in the human eye. You see a mysterious longing which nothing under the sun can satisfy except God. We've seen them over the years. They worship trees. I come from a place in Muendi where there is a tree called which people literally go to worship. How many know about it? Oh, there are many people who don't know. Go and research it. Many people have made documentaries out of it. People go there to ask for a fruit of the womb. People go there to ask for promotion many things and you know because they're thirsting for those things and then they think that you know a tree will help them. I've seen in Ethiopia in some place where they go to a river is a very big group of people. They believe that that river There are some spirits there that will give them what they need. So they go there every once a year to worship and and um you know in many other traditions in Africa and also out of Africa. When I was in Australia, &gt;&gt; they showed me a mountain where they say the Aboriginal people, the the natives there, you know, they go there, they believe that, you know, they will get the fruit of the womb. And today is a tourist attraction. But people still go and and to ask for children. Why do people do this thing? Because they have a thirst in their heart. But you see this thirst no nothing else can satisfy. Only God can. In Romans 8:23, he says that not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit, Even we ourselves grown within ourselves. What the scripture say? What do we do? We grown &gt;&gt; grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to the redemption of our bodies. That groaning is the deep calling. the adoption, the change of our bodies. Last time I talked about the theophony bodies. Each of us has one. And you see there is something within us. Longing for a body change, longing for our full adoption. That's why we come to hear the word. That's why we love to sing. That's why we love to worship. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you worship and you don't want to stop. Why? Sometimes you cry. You You didn't say, "Let me sing so I can cry." But as you are singing and then you feel like crying, you begin crying. You begin like feeling like throwing your hand up and woring. And when you hear the word, you feel good. What is it? It's a longing in our within us. You know, it is a groaning within every believer waiting for the adoption. Amen. The redemption of our body. Praise God. Now, that's the deep in us. But also, there is a deep in God. When a deep in man calls, it is because the deep in God first called in John 6:44. The scripture says, "No man can come to me except my father draw." How does how does he draw you? I've seen I've been in services where people have been baptized with the Holy Spirit. But you see, you find that one is baptized with the Holy Spirit, but another one on the side is just wondering what's happening like looking around as if it is a funny thing happening. Why? Because there is a deep calling in this person. And therefore when the deep in God calls it, this person will quickly respond. Let me tell you something. That's why you should never come to church before prayer. If you want God to do something for you, come prayed up. I wonder how many here doing. Come to church, pray down. You must have a desire. Don't just come. Have a desire. I remember there was, you know, when I had just first believed and I would, you know, before I got church, I would read my Bible. and pray say God speak to me as I'm going to your house may you minister to me may you make the preacher just address my needs and whenever that would happen and this happened multiple times this preacher would always start with a scripture that I was reading and the moment that would happen I would just be in heaven places. So people in church would see me excited shouting and rejoicing what's happening because they they are not where I am. So they can't understand has it ever happened to you? Yes. But if you come to church when you just let me go and see what is there whatever you were expecting you will get your expectation will be met. Tell your neighbor your expectation will be met. Your expectation will be met. Praise God. my expectation will be met. Brother Bham talked about expectation and he said whatever you expect when you come into the house of God you will get it focus here whatever you expect when you go in the house of God you will get he said if you expect to find a mistake or something wrong, you will find it. If you expect to find people who are not serious, you will find it. And I've often seen people who always concentrate on the negative things and they always want to spread it across the congregation and they will always come around and say, "Brother, are you not are you not seeing what's happening in the church these days? People are cold. There is no fire. There is no you know even I think people living in sin. Yeah. I think you are right. And then but I had not seen it but you when you come when you come this time you will see what I was saying. You see like sister nani brothers especially those ones you watch them and the person will come to church you think they have come expecting to hear from God they have come because of the of their gossip while while the world is going on they are very busy yeah brother this is better now they are very busy looking on the side told me to see brother is He's not dozing. Let me look. Yeah. This is what happening to sister Charity. Look at where she's. She's no longer serious. Now, of course, I'm not saying she is, but you get the point. So, now this person will become more And they also talk to another one. Brother, are you seeing what's happening in the church? That is a demon spirit moving in those people. Destroy the hearts of the expectant. That's why the prophet said when when we're going to have a service, don't come in late, come early. 30 minutes early. There's a a church I appreciated several, but I'll just mention church in Melbourne Melbourne. &gt;&gt; You know, I I saw that really happen what the prophet told and in other places, but I'll just mention that because it's what I felt when I entered in. You know these people arrive quite early 20 10 minutes before the service 20 they begin coming and 10 minutes before the service preaching rather before the song reading I'm already in the church fully seated no one moving no one talking to anybody Everybody is in meditation, praying, waiting upon God, having an expectation, maybe reading their Bible or reading a message book, waiting upon God, and I tell you what, song leader comes, people have been waiting for 30 minutes. The musicians have been on their planes. And when the song leader stepped up, oh, I loved that brother. You know, he sings like heaven has come down. He He sings, you can sing with all his heart. He's not singing to entertain anybody. He He was singing just to worship God. And the people too would join in. You will not see anybody looking around. You just see people closing their eyes worshiping God. You know I saw that brother you song leading you know oh God and you just do like this and worship God with all his heart and as soon as I walked in the presence of God came over me. I just felt like crying. I don't know what happens to me when the presence comes. feel so good and loved. I just love I just felt I wanted to be here. And when it came time to preach, I preached like I was going to die. I tell you friend, that is what brings the presence of the Holy Spirit. It's not a good preacher. It's not a good people. It is the people that have been expectant. If there is a deep within you calling, there will be a deep response. You have a need, you come with it to church in prayer praying, oh God, may you provide, may you speak to me through the so everything, you can't even move out because you don't want to miss anything. But this business of people going out, this one coming in shows there is no deep calling, it shows you're just pulling and pushing. It's like taking a child who is sick and you're forcing them to eat. Food will just, you know, litter all over the floor. Get a spoon and fast them. Eat it. Eat it. It comes in the nose. It comes in the back. It goes all over you. &gt;&gt; That's a kind of a service where you feel that there is a kind of hardiness in the people. It's like the word is coming but it cannot penetrate. Why? Because you have not prayed out. You are not expectant. It's not a pastor that makes a service. It is all of us together that bring the presence of God. I tell you, we have to grow up. We as a congregation here at Divia, we have to grow up. You know, we have to stop this business of coming late. Just run a church and then you come and sing. You're like yawning and and then you go out and the pastors begin to preach. You will go out three four times. If you don't have a deep calling, don't come. Brother, preach to 10 people and the presence of God will come. I'm telling you, that's what we need. That's what the bride needs in this world. The people that are hungering for God, hungering for the word in prayer before they come. early pray. But if you're not here, the song leader will come on the platform and he will be singing with chairs. You think that God will move in your heart after the song leader. The song leader doesn't come to take time as we wait for the preacher. This is a pastoral sermon this morning. A song leader comes to help prepare our hearts for the word to come. If there is a deep in us, you know God will surely come through the preacher and he will speak exactly what your need was. And I can tell you, we can see the lamb walking, the blind seeing. We can see miracles happening. And we have seen it before in this church. Several times. Why? Because people were expectant. In the youth comes when we go, people come and they expect God is going to do something. And indeed God does things. But you see if you come halfhazardly just to go just to be you are coming to be a stumbling block. May God help you. May God help each of us that brother. You will grow up sister. You will grow up. You will be a conductor of of the anointing. Amen. That when you come, you not come. Oh, I didn't sleep last night. I didn't sleep well. So, God understands. Why didn't you sleep well? The Bible says God gives his beloved sleep. You know you have service Sunday morning. If you know you have a flight or you have an appointment for a job application, At 8:00 a.m. in the morning, what time do you sleep? Answer me, church. Answer me. You sleep past midnight. You sleep early. Let me sleep early. So I wake up early. I don't want to miss that interview. There are very few people who miss flights. There are few who miss flight because they prepare. They prepare early. They do everything early. But you find them rushing at the end. They are rushing but they have three hours before the fight. But because they know there's a procedure, I have to be checked. My card bags have to be checked. I have to check in my do this. I have to pass and everything. But for us, we we are preparing to come Sunday morning. So the living God, can minister to our needs and we decide to sleep 3:00 a.m. in the night and you wake up too late, too tired. And then I will I even go to church today. Let me try anyway. What will they say? Maybe I'm preaching about you and then you come yawning. Well, you you shower also because you don't want people to say anyway, you come dress up then you come. But you come yawning and you arrive here. You're yawning. You sit in the chair. The song say, "Let us lift up our hands." But song leader, God understand, let let me and as soon as the preacher begins, it's like a la for you. Amen. Amen. When a deacon wakes you up, I was not sleeping. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, we need to change. We need to grow. We need to grow. If you have Sunday morning service and I have a reason why I'm preaching this because as a pastor, I can discern the spiritual climate of the people. I know the difference between Wednesday services here and morning services on Sunday. for the past few services. You are not expectant. You come here, not ready. If you are not ready, then you will not hear from him. But if you come pray, you come ready to hear from God. You come and sit and be in prayer and wait upon God. And physicians also you're serious these days. They're running up and running. We don't even pray. Begin to pray. There's no anointing. You're flowing in the flesh and you're bringing it as a blanket of anointing. Let me tell you, we need to change because this place here is a hospital for God to deliver the sick and the bound. But we need to create the atmosphere for real, the atmosphere for revival, the atmosphere for miracles, the atmosphere for the supernatural. Let us make ourselves ready. Come on. Musicians be on time. Be really serious. By the way, I've always seen these people out in the Pentecostals. Not I'm not here like you know these these ones are not serious. But I'm talking about the serious Pentecostals. And I'm I'm being sincere with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; A typical Pentecostal church, the full Saturday will be rehearsals and preparation. Am I saying the truth? Rehearsals and preparation. The prayer team is in their section. They don't need to be told to pray. They have a burden to pray for the service, to pray for the pastor, pray for the, you know, the musicians and everybody. And then the musicians, they know it as a duty, they come, they are practicing the whole day, morning to evening. Those who work, they come in the afternoon. And then The those who want to sing special songs, they also come that same and practice. But here when they said no one should sing unless they have practiced special songs reduced. What is the indication? You are singing for a show not as a minister. I'm going to be real with you today. Every sermon you see me preaching. I prepare. I don't just speak a scripture, let me read for them this way. I wait upon God. I wait. I pray. I read. I study. Sometimes hours and days. and sometimes even the whole night and come here when I've not slept the whole night. Not because I wanted to, I didn't, but because I felt like consecrating myself more. But you see, it's not the pastor's job alone. Everyone must wait upon the Lord for his ministry. The musicians too. Even if you want to sing a special song, now I pay money on Sunday, I pay money on on Saturday to go. No, no, I I will not sing. It is ministry. If God has given you a voice to sing, come on Saturday, practice your song, sing it, make sure it is well. Then you come on Sunday morning prayed up ready to minister. A special song is not just a song. It's a ministry. You are ministering to the saint. The Bible says someone has a sound. Someone has a a dream or someone has prophecy or someone has this or someone has an expectation. We bring it to be able to edify the Amen. &gt;&gt; Those who are growing are growing. &gt;&gt; So before there was a creation, before you were born, there was a call from God's deep for you. That's why you could never rest in sin in the world. That's why you turned away from the world. Something from eternity began calling you home. Why am I here? I'm I'm not here because I I just wanted to. I was here because the father drew me. The Bible says as we read before, no one can come to the father unless he draws you. Draws you. Draws you. Rosie, rose. I remember brother Baka when he first came to church. I mean, you know, never been even these other churches, but somehow when he came the first time, there was a deep already calling. The deep in you was just responding to the call. Let me tell you, each of you is here because you're responding to the calling of the father. Hallelujah. If there is a a deep calling in you for healing, if you are sick, there is another deep response. You cannot be healed. Unless you have expectation for healing, but you see there has to be healing somewhere. If you hunger for more of God, There is bound to be more of God to respond to it somewhere. If you've only been justified by faith and know nothing about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you hunger for the Holy Spirit, there's got to be a Holy Ghost somewhere to fill that hunger. Listen, the problem we have these days People know I don't have the Holy Spirit and they don't hunger for him. Let me tell you, you will never receive him. You have to hunger and hunger until you find. It's like someone saying, "I'm hungering for water, but because all I've got is porridge, is some soda, some this, some that I feel water doesn't exist, that person will die and he will never get water because he has given up too early, too soon. If you need the Holy Spirit, I'm talking about you who needs the baptism of the Holy Spirit. God still fills people with the baptism. Because you see, that's the power to overcome the world. If you feel that your addiction is stronger than than you, it means you don't have the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The devil is trying to bring addictions and these other things you so don't give up and say, "I prayed. I prayed. I fasted but I didn't find." Why did you pray and fast? Because there was a hunger in you. And because there is a hunger in you, there is a Holy Ghost somewhere to fill your heart and change you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you believe you are you you are hungering for a change, I tell you don't give up. Keep searching, keep seeking, keep desiring pain. God will fill you. And if you believe today that there is a God who heals, there's got to be a fountain open somewhere for healing. Oh, that desire wouldn't be there. Amen. I just remembered Sister Diana right here. I think they might be online streaming this. You see, sister Diana has believed that God will open her eyes because you see, you have to understand that this is a sister who did not who had lost a sense of feeling. She had lost the sense of uh of smell. She had lost hearing. She had lost all the five senses. But you see, she believed together with her mother, sister, mother that God would heal her. And you know, God began restoring one by one by one by one. And now what is remaining is the eyes. And you know what they've told her? It is impossible for her to see again unless it is a miracle. But she believes she will see again. And here is I have a message for you sister. If you believe there is healing for you somewhere and you have that hunger and ask for it. Don't let anything put down your faith. Hunger alone. So there's a brand new eyes for you. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whatever you hung for sure it is somewhere. The brother was hungering and looking for a wife. Going here, meeting this one, meeting that one, going to his church. One time I called him. And I said, "Brother, stop moving around. Stay put." Said, "I'm looking. I'm looking. I'm looking." And that's how many of us are. We don't stay in God's provided place of worship. We are going here. We are going there. We are going. We are going there. &gt;&gt; But what is making you look for help? Because you have a deep calling within. You feel there is a something. Amen. And the brother said I found her in the youth meeting right in your church. God brought her to you. Hallelujah. If you are in the will of God, brother, stay in the word. Stay in the word. Don't let anything take you out. Because if there is a deep calling with you, there is a deep somewhere to respond to that thing. Hallelujah. Amen. the way of God providing you with something and giving you a desire for it. And if you have a hunger and a desire to receive the Holy Ghost, it means God has already given you the Holy Ghost. Now just keep hungering. Keep trusting. You shall find. You shall be filled. The Bible says, "Amen, blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, they shall be filled." Hallelujah. Yes, sir. God can never lie. In other words, like this before there was a creation, there had to be a creator to build that creation. Let me go up a little bit. And if you believe today there is a God who heals, there's got to be a fountain open somewhere for you or that desire wouldn't be there. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. If you desire God to heal you, some of those sicknesses that you get and you believe God can heal, I believe God can heal you. Then if you have that faith, brother, If you have a desire for divine healing, don't let anything talk you out of it. Our God opens the blinded eye. He heals HIV. By the way, he does these things. There are many, too many with testimonies. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I've witnessed personally God healing a man who was almost dead and God delivered him and healed him from tuberculosis and raised him up and until today is testifying of the grace of God. Amen. I prayed for the demon possessed and you know people who people thought they would never be delivered. Someone demonp possessed you know those stubborn demons. Brother Martin, where are you? He's dealt with them sometimes. He knows what I'm talking about. Very stubborn demon on a few occasions here and there. Several occasion we've cast out those demons. But you see one thing with it. If there is a desire for someone to be delivered from those kind of demon oppression, it means there is something that can deliver them. You remember that man who was lying on the pallet for 38 years. 38 years. Lying on the pallet. and and and you know when he saw Jesus of course Jesus passed I don't have anybody I can run others have run but you know what Jesus told him stand up on your feet carry your bed and walk 38 years delay is not denial 38 years. This man he stayed there. But the problem with us, we want something rush quick fast. God wants you to exercise faith and faith is unmovable. When things are happening in the wrong way, you stay there. Stay in the word. Stay at your place of you. You are a wife. Things are not going well. Stay in your home. Amen. A man, stay with your responsibility and keep believing, keep praying, if there is a desire in you that things will go well, then I'm telling you this morning, things must go well. Desire is the way God communicates to say I am here to give you what you need. I am here to provide. But the problem many don't believe long enough. When God is about to come through for you, he doesn't find you in a place where he expected you 38 years. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; He waited first year, second year, third year, fourth year, sixth year until the Messiah came. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And the creator is the first before the creation. And there is a creation in your heart here to hunger and thirst for divine healing. a God that will have mercy on you. There's got to be a God somewhere to have mercy on you and that creates that creation. The one who created you. Now that's true. &gt;&gt; It is something you are hungry for. Now when a deep in you meets the deep in God, something supernatural happens. Amen. A union happens. like Isaac and Rebecca, &gt;&gt; you know, Isaac, she was uh, you know, Rebecca was walking before she even met him. But when she saw him in a distance, something within said, "That is him. That is Isaac. That's your husband." And she asked somebody, "Is that him?" And they said, "Yes." She quickly recover herself and she ran a rider horse or something and she went to meet him. Let me tell you the deep was calling the deep. &gt;&gt; Okay, let me build it for you here. Genesis 24:14 and let it come to pass. M &gt;&gt; I want to show you how God works that this is now the um the man that has gone to look for a wife Isaac and he prays listen to the prayer and let it come to pass that the dams to whom I shall say let down thy picture I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say drink please follow me closer and I will give thy camels also. Let the same be she that has that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac. Do you see how how he prayed? Appointed here means predestinated chosen before Rebecca ever knew Isaac. She was appointed She was predestinated. She was chosen to be the real wife of Isaac. And God blesses within this man to pray a prayer. What you would call an impossible prayer. Amen. Oh my. receive what I'm telling you right now because I'm now downloading things from the divine world. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. How many are connected here? Amen. Yes. Maybe the people begin calling you now. Here, you know, she wanted to be married. She didn't but she could not talk to any man. It was time for her to get married. But I but she was a good woman. And now God leads this man to pray a prayer that is according to the heart and life of this woman. The deep calling unto the deep. This woman was naturally kind. She was a good woman. She was raised well. Not any woman can do what she did. These camels were so many going back and forth. I don't know how many times to look for water to feed these camels. But you see as soon as she came, the Bible says before he even finished praying, this woman came and and and you know he said, "Oh yeah, water." Said, "Oh, sure. I I will also get for the who put that in. It was the prayer prayed when Rebecca was not there. But now Rebecca had she had a desire to be helpful, to be kind. But that same desire was the deep responding to the deep. That desire in her was what God blessed in her to help so she can be able to get a husband. Hallelujah. Amen. That's how God works. He tells Elijah, "Go, I've commanded a woman to feed you." Sister Rose, how was that woman commanded? How was that woman commanded? Did God command her? Of course, we know when Elijah arrived, this woman did not know anything. Did she know? Because the prophet said, "Give me to drink." She was going to bring and then he said, "Bring me also something to eat." She said, "No, man of God. You have asked for too much. What I have is for me and my son and then we shall die." But you know, because God had commanded her. How does God command? God convicts your heart. God moves in your heart. You desire to do something. So now this woman who made her heart softer to surrender everything she had knowing she would die. It was God. It was God. You who has done things that you never even knew why you were doing them. For the work of God, brother, always be in obedience. Be in obedience. Be in obedience. Be in obedience. God can move on your heart and say, "You know what? That brother doesn't have shoes. Buy him brand new." You be like, "Ah, huh." &gt;&gt; But you see that desire you have, it's not you. It is God moving. If you don't do it, you have disobeyed. You heard the pastor talking about whatever machines. You need millions of money. Well, I have 2 millions on my account. It is my saving and God has told me you you are now going to give all of it. Of course, that was a thought. It was not God. It was me. It has happened here before is just right there. She had a small savings. When we starting to collect land fund many years ago, she gave all of it. She came to me and she was saying, "Pastor, this is God. I'm going to give all of you." I said, "Sometimes as a pastor, you feel bad for sister. Are you sure?" Yeah. God has moved on my heart to do it. All right. If it is God and you know what she got, I think triple. Is it triple or four times? God speaks to you by desire. And that woman, that widow desired, he said, "Okay, I'll do it." That was God commanded. Many people have done things for you when they didn't even know why. It was God who had commanded to do it for you. Amen. So, she was chosen before. Amen. Genesis 24:57 and they said we will call the dam. &gt;&gt; This is after everything. Now the he wants to marry her. And the parents are saying we will call the dam and inquire at her mouth and they called Rebecca. And they said unto Rebecca, will you go with this man? And she say I will go. When they when you know when they called her name something inside her responded she recognized her place in the promised. Oh hallelujah. Remember the calling was upon Abraham and his city. But you see, Rebecca had a place in that. She had to be God knew before the foundation of the world. She had to be the wife of Isaac. And here she was. Will you go? He said, "I will go." That's why marriage is not by force. It has to be the deep calling into the deep. Stop saying, "I'm waiting for a dream. I'm waiting for this. I'm waiting for that. The deep calling unto the deep. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of you who are looking for marriage, whatever you desire, God is going to give it to you. Now remember I said whatever you desire. Your husband is exactly the way you want him. Your wife is exactly the way you want her. Brother Grace, are you getting my point? Exactly the way you want her. But you see, many of us settle for less. That's the mistake. And then later he begins. I wish I knew. &gt;&gt; I really dropped a step. Don't settle for less. Your desire is the way God communicates to you. She said, "I'll go." And Rebecca lifted up her eyes. When she saw Isa, she lighted off the camel. Therefore, she took a veil. and later uncovered herself. When she saw him, there was an inner witness. She knew him by revelation. Not introduction. Revelation. Not introduction. I don't believe in matchmaking. That's not the way of God. Don't marry someone else because you've been introduced. Make sure it's a revelation. She's the one. He's the one. Then it's an there is an inner witness in you. That's the deep calling to the deep. In the same way, spiritually speaking, the bride of Christ today, when she hears the voice of the bridegroom through the revealed word of God, something cries out, "This is what I need. This is what I believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My sister here was telling me they were dying in the denomination. &gt;&gt; Why? Why? How did she answer that or rather what was she answering? When she asked me, "Who is brother?" I always get to talking about him. And then I began explaining to her who brother is being the messenger of our generation and how he has led us back again to the apostolic faith and things like that. You know what others would say? I don't want to believe. But because she was an ill before the foundation of the world, she said, I recognize that your heart cries out. That's what I want. That's the deep calling to the deep. The word recognizing the word recognizing You see, Paul connects this same mystery to the bride of Christ. When he says, "For whom he did for one know, he also did predestin according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me." You see the bride like the bride of Christ like Rebecca like Rebecca there was chosen before they met him. Give us that that chorus. We used to sing it many years ago. It says victory sing with me in Jesus my savior forever. He sold me with his redeeming blood. He said, "You are not singing. He loved me and all my love. He plunged me to victory the he loved me." that that what there is before I knew him and all my life is due him. He planned me to victory beneath the blazing. Give me the next listen. I had a no. Give me give me give me the the next stanza. All right. I heard about his healing of his cleansing power revealed, how he made the lamb to walk again and cause the blind to see. And then I cried, "Dear Jesus, come and heal my broken." And somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory. You see friends, we were fornown, predestinated and called. But you see when the word Christ is revealed in your day, something within you responds recognizing that word. Every true call will always be answered. A baby cries, there must be milk somewhere. A fish has fins that there must be water somewhere. A bird has wings. There must be air to fly in. There is something in you crying for God. There is a Holy Ghost somewhere to satisfy that cry. That's why the message of the hour comes not to give us a new religion or a new theology. By the way, let me tell you this message is here to satisfy the deep cry in our heart. We are crying out for the original word, the truth, the same life that was in Jesus. And then when we hear it, &gt;&gt; we say amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I was an Anglican boy and I was a very dedicated one. But I had too many questions. And my priests could not answer them. If you ask them too much, they tell you you don't have to ask too much. Just believe. But my heart was still punching for more for more. And then I met this truth. Oh, it answered every one of my prayers. Hallelujah. Let me tell you, it put me on fire. And I started telling everybody about it. If you are on fire, you are going to witness to other people about this message. I be I I got on fire, put up a website and started telling everybody and whoever I meet even when I go to the banks wherever I go. I remember there was one time I was in Nairobi and I I I had this usually walked with my tracks but I don't know whether you're printing those these days. I know and we were I was with those trucks and I usually leave it wherever I go. So when I was in this went to a bank with a brother and I was we were waiting somewhere and I gave to the teller and some other person read this meanwhile and this brother told me this I've never seen it this way but it's a good idea by the way of outreach. Do you know you can do outreach everywhere and anywhere? everywhere and everywhere. Every person you see is a potential believer. Give them the message. Take some tracks. Come to brother M. You'll give it to them. Take some books and give it to them. Don't worry about who will believe, who will not. There is a deep calling in them. this message will respond. Praise God. I believe when I was coming from the other church, I was online and I saw brother Okai online just about 100 kilometers from the Red Sea in northern Ethiopia. You see this is a he was an elder in one of the churches, the denominations. I have never seen the message truth strike somebody like it did him. He read the church age book and finished it and he called me to come and discuss it. So I traveled there. It's 2 hours flight from Addis 1 hour and a half. So I arrived there and we in this hotel room and we begin sharing with him. I was with another brother and friends this is beyond what a man can do. This was God. The deep was responding to me. And he looked down and shaking voice and he spoke his words. He said this is the truth. I have believed it and I would like baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ 50 something years old and we baptized him. But I tell you what, God has used that brother and his son to now translate this message into the local language of that region. You think it was me who brought you to the Lord? No. No one brings anyone to the Lord. It is a deep in them responding. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why are you here? Because the deep in you responding. That's why I say hallelujah. I cannot back. I cannot fall. I cannot be destroyed. The devil cannot manage me because I came here responding to something. I was responding to the deep in God. So I am here to stay. The devil might as well get used to me loving my Jesus because listen I cannot fall away. I would have finished but give me a few more minutes. It is raining. So listen, I cannot fall away. There is something we need to understand. He said all that you have given me are in my hands. None of them can be lost. So there is eternal security. You can never fall away. Let me tell you a few things that cannot happen to you. Let me tell you a few things which cannot happen to you. You cannot fall away. &gt;&gt; You cannot go to hell. You cannot be destroyed by your trial or temptation. Hallelujah. You are indestructible. You are supernatural. You are divine. Why? Because you were in the mind of God before but you were lost here in time. But the word came and called you. How did you respond when you had a deep within you? By the time the word came or you had a desire in you said that's how it was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the devil was giving you other things to satisfy the thirst you had but one by one you begin throwing them away alcohol doesn't satisfy cigarettes women adultery fornication men doesn't satisfy did you throw away my appreciation to people who threw Hey. Hallelujah. Witchcraft. Some of you we are doing witchcraft. You remember? You remember you say it doesn't satisfy one by one. Last doesn't satisfy. You threw away. You threw away. You threw away. And since then you have been drinking from a real fountain. And the devil thinks that you will not be changed. But it's too late now. You already changing. Even if you can't see it, it is happening inside. And on the inside, it's going to be manifest on the outside. Soon and very soon, we are going to walk into our will know as we are known. as we are known. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; When we get over there, then we can look at one another. You made it. I made it. You made it. You made it. You made it. No more worries, no more fears, no more sickness, no more temptation. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We would have overcome. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I believe brother Sad and brother are saying pastor wait for that part. We want our wedding before the rapture. But I tell you brothers, that one is better than anything else. Hallelujah. When we get over there, we will not need anything because we shall have received everything. Jesus is everything. &gt;&gt; The word is everything. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Let me try to conclude now. You see that's why now I want to show you here in Isaiah 65. And it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer and while they are yet speaking I will hear. This is God speaking. Before they call I will answer. While they yet speaking, I will hear. This is going to happen in the millennium. But even before then, God blesses a desire in the elect because he has already made provision to fulfill it. Show that every two spiritual hunger is evidence a divine answer is already existing. When God begins to deal with a soul deeply, worldly ambition is fed. You begin to hunger for prayer. You begin to hunger for the word and fellowship with God. That's why revival doesn't start in the crowd. It begins in the deep places of the heart. Hallelujah. Amen. Men desiring God, hungering for God, wanting to see a revival, wanting to see miracles, wanting to see things happen and then a revival breaks out. Amen. You see, in deep into the deep, it says when Lutherans had their revival, There's a group called Methodist. They called for God, the deep calling to the deep. God rose up a little old fellow over in England by the name of John Wiz and Whitefield and them. And where they went with a message of sanctification. They found more grace, found more of God. They was craving for more. When it went on for a while, And after a while the method begin to organize and get a cold formal then people begin to cry more. So if you see coldness beginning to happen there will be someone hungering. Never feel like I need to pray for the church. Don't let others do it. Some people they feel it. And they want to first organize everybody. They want everybody to join. Do you know you can come here by yourself and begin to pray for the church? Begin to pray for the family. Begin to pray for everyone, for the ministry, for the needs. And you know it has happened before where you will find several people in the church and they all coming to pray on a day that is not a day of prayer just on their own and then when you ask they ask each other so they can carry each other's burdens what's your burdens I'm praying for the ministry it's the same need that's how revival starts till God moves on you as an individual not as an organization. You see they found more of God and you know revival started out. Then along came Pentecost deep to the deep. Now this Pentecostal people begin to just get a a a form a spirit ritual as the rest of them. Before you know it deep there came you and me. desiring for more than just Pentecostalism. Desiring for the restoration of the world. &gt;&gt; What is it? Deep calling to the deep. Amen. In this final hour, friends. There is a deep in God calling his bride out of denominational system, out of formality, out of this year, back to the original one. And there is a deep in the bride responding to that call. Revelation 18:4 come out of her people. What is it? That's the deep in God calling come out of her people. But you see Revelation 22:20 and the bride says even so come Lord Jesus. What is it? As the deep in the bride responding, God calling him come out of our people. Even so come Lord Jesus. When the deep in God calls, there's a deep response. Hallelujah. Amen. And I finish with Mark 11. Therefore I say unto you what things you desire. &gt;&gt; Oh people did not hear it by the Lord. My my my my hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Did you receive all your desires Monica? Let me tell you whatever else you desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't just say Sister Alan I'm done. I've got married. There is more in God, there is more blessings. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you my sister. What thingsever you desire. &gt;&gt; What do you desire? &gt;&gt; What do you desire? Do you know the Bible said what? What? Let me no more no more language. Whatever you desire, whatever thing you desire. Now, how the desire come? First of all, be born again. Be filled with the Holy Ghost. Now, I'm talking to those ones. Okay? Don't misunderstand me. This scripture, this scripture applies to the Holy Ghost filled, the born again. The ones who are like sister because remember, God cannot try even to ask a person who is not born again to do this. What if the person says I want them to be You understand the point? So God will tell you if he knows you are regenerated. Your desire is his desire. Now if you're born again when you have a desire, it is the way of God communicating to you to tell you that thing is somewhere. Hallelujah. Let me emphasize if you're born again, okay? Let's talk to you. Whatever you desire, I'm not saying think about something. I'm talking about the desire you already have. Some of you say, "Oh, God, all I need is a little job." No. Is that your real desire? What's your desire? If you were sister right now and God asked you, ask what you desire. You will have it. Even if it's a million dollar, it will be right there. It happened before. Some people don't know the story I'm talking about. Brother in America, sister and and he was giving her a testimony and sister said amen because it was a supernatural testimony of what he had done and she believed it she accepted it.
