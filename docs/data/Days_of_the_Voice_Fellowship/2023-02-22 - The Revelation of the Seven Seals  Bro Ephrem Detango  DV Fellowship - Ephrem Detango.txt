Hallelujah Revelation chapter 5. it starts like this from verse one and I saw in the right hand of him that sit on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book to lose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth under the Earth were able to open the book neither to look their own and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look their own [Music] God bless the world Hallelujah I'm happy to see you I never give I never feel like I'm a guest this is always my home and it will be my home Hallelujah and I would like to bring much greetings from where I Fellowship from House of Fellowship the Saints the brothers and the ministers have sent their lovely greetings thank you for receiving from Addis ABA bibleway Church they have also seen their lives thank you very much I'm very happy to see Mama Lisa she have done a lot in our lives spiritual and physical she never speaks out but behind she has today my subject will be the revelation of the Seven Seas there are many teachings that will make it assume it is very hard to received there are many doctrines to make it look it's very heavy for people is but I believe today we will receive it in a very simplified way hallelujah amen because God revealed himself in Simplicity Hallelujah he was never in big things he was never in public people will make it very complicated and when Jesus Christ the Messiah comes so we can see here in the Book of Revelation there is a there is a a special book one way and this book was sealed with Seven Seals [Music] because no one were worthy to open the book not only to open the books but to look on the books why would he whip what makes that spoke so special what makes it so important that you whipped why was it no man was he or in heaven and put it [Music] [Music] and those were still in Seven Seals Hallelujah let us read from Genesis Genesis chapter 3 . Genesis no the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field with the Lord God made and he said unto the woman he is that God said he shall not eat of every two of the garden is [Music] the serpent was very subtle [Music] you will never see him coming you will see most people the servant they paint it as if he has a he's very scary that is not it looks a very good gentleman and even what he speaks is a word of God you can see he's coming preaching what the Lord has said to us and she never see him coming you may see one of some brothers for telling me I never saw this coming I lost my job I come early I never complained but these people they make sure I have not gotten this job okay he comes in a beautiful way he comes in a very right way it looks atmosphere is very right and you'll wake up [Music] when you are exposed is when you realize you are insane Adam never knew he was going to lose but he found himself in sin also Hallelujah let us read Genesis chapter 3 verse 17. now they had made sins found in transgression and the Lord is giving them a word in 17 he says and unto Adam he said because thou had had turned unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten the tree of which I command thee saying Thou shalt not eat of Thee Kirsty to the ground for thy sake in sorrow shall thou eat of it all the days of life thou all the thirsty shall it bring forth the tree and thou shalt eat the herbs of the field in this weight of thy face shall thy eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was taken from the dust Thou Art and unto dust thou shall return okay because [Music] I'll not take much of your time and you see now the Adam fall Adam and when you fall all the Earth that were human beings also were Fallen Adam foreign Hallelujah let us read from the book but it was not so from the beginning we read in the Bible that he that was sitting on the throne had that book and it was sealed inside and outside and there is no man in heaven in Earth or able to take the book from the hand of him that sit upon the throne no one was found worthy no one was found worthy that's why you see uh Daniel tried to look up the books no man worthy to fight to open that book okay that's why John was crying because in that book that is your problems because no one was worthless he himself that's why he was found in the presence of God and fall on the ground he know he was not worthy we thank the Lord amen let's read Revelation chapter 5. from the book 6106 11 Revelation chapter 5 part 1. paragraph 91. yes true from the book about it the prophet here was explaining the book was sealed by these Seven Seals in the whole mystery of the book is sealed upon the Seven Seals you can see how important the book is there is a mystery inside that's going to be revealed Hallelujah before that was there in the beginning Hallelujah Hallelujah let us read Revelation chapter 5. so now we have understood why Jonah was crying important the book is from verse one and I saw in the right hand of him that sit on the throne a book written within on a backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a lord Voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose his Seven Seals therefore and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth was able to open the book neither to look therefore and I wept much because no one was Worthy to open and to read the book neither to look and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David had prevailed to open the book and to lose the Seven Seals and I behold law in the midst of that Throne of the four beasts and in the midst of the Elder stood a lamp as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which is the seventh spirit of God sent from the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him and sit on the throne and when he had to take the book The Four beasts and the four the twelve Elders fell down before the lamp having one of them in the golden Wheels full of orders and are praying on the Saints Hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] I will finish by 11 and 12 verse 11 and 12 and it says and I beheld I heard the voice of many angels round above the throne in the beast in the elders in the numbers of them ten thousand ten thousand and ten thousand saying with the loud voice Worthy is a lamp that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strings and honor and glory and blessings there is only one worthy there is only one word and give the book Hallelujah he paid the price for you he prayed the praise for you for you to receive and to be redeemed Hallelujah [Music] because he paid the price [Music] he has paid the price no one can pay the price he was a slain lamp and then he got the price hallelujah what was sealed what was in the right hand of God he was able to take it yes that's where you belong that's where your home is that is where your home is our home where we live eternally where there is no sickness we thank the Lord amen let us read what the prophet have said the restoration of the bright tree he said restoration is to bring back to the formal owner to bring back to the former state of the conditions [Music] [Music] somewhere in the went away from the rightful honor but to restore it to bring back to where it belongs [Music] and in order to do this we have a right in Force if there is a law to info foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] thank you being the child of God foreign [Applause] the book into you Hallelujah Daniel tried to open the book [Music] because he knows the book was worthy it was no time yet when we read Revelation 10. it says at the seventh angels all the Mysteries shall be finished [Music] but when the service Angels start to shine start to give us the message that was in the books Amina yes sir let us read the message called the bridge between seven churches and Seven Seas [Music] the prophet says now see the mystery of the Seven Seals book foreign Church and the Seven Angels begins to sound a message in the tips now at the beginning of the sounding of the message of the Mysteries all the Mysteries shall be revealed to you hallelujah what was there in the beginning it will not be given to you all the Mysteries shall be revealed to you what Adam has Adam alive for many years it was sealed it was still with seven sins whatever he we believe the message hallelujah hallelujah the message will reveal it to us who we are reveal to us our position it will put us in the right track what was it in the beginning Hallelujah let us stand in our feet and pray Hallelujah Heavenly Father we thank you for the thing so that he can be we thank you for giving him the life that he deserves for the testimony that we are hearing Lord we thank you Lord for you be the only one who takes the glory in Jesus name amen amen thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] do you remember how old was he when we first met him foreign and [Music] um how old are you now brother 23. and he married recently yeah and he's a new father so he sent me a message and said congratulations you are now a grandfather he said oh yeah I thought what we have had here tonight is fire the Roses God has said this gift in a new place if you remember is currently there is no pasta in ourselves and uh you know after the work there started I I left you brother Tim left and this was an entirely a new church I remember there was about the ones I remember that we baptized in one time or about 30 people but there were more that were baptized later on but there was you know a ship without a Shepherd cannot remain together is see there was a big vacuum in one room and brother Ephraim organized took it upon himself [Music] and he came to me he said and I hope you don't mind standing for a little because God has confirmed it to you one person came and spoke to him but I don't remember whether it was a prophecy or whatever but she spoke to him and told him I said how long do they give you two weeks they said they said after after he had preached the message to them they were so angry with him that they told him young man you were here to waste your life and they told him we have given you two weeks if you don't leave this city you are going to die how long have you been there amen and he was telling me I was so surprised when I had the testimony he was telling me that I think every week is it every week or every month every week he baptized like how many people on average like five or six people every week they have services not once a week two three it six days a week they have services for serious business the church did not send him there God sent him do you know what happened when he received the message it was like a fire that began to consume and I believe it is that that has sent him into that City and there are many people now that are being baptized and coming to the knowledge of the message I don't know what anybody else believes but here is what I believe God has put something in him that will be a great blessing to the country and nation of Ethiopia Ethiopia Hallelujah the best we can do is to pray for
