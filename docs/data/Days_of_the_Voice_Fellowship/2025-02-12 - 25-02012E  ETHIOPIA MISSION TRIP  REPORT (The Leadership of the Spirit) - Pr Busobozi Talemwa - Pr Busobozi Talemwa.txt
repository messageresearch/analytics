left and so we were left behind and uh but thank God that we were using Ethiopian Airlines and um you know usually they have several flights going to the same place around the same time so I'm speaking this for you while I'm waiting for of course when the power goes off and on it affecting these these machines so uh then eventually we were able to go through and um and um we we got another flight and then we we went on board and and then 50 minutes later we arrived in aasa when we arrived in aasa we realized our bugs are not there so we waited and waited our bugs were not there so uh it was quite something I mean we were tired and the brothers were tired I mean after carja then year then you know we were really tired but God God was gracious um uh we just uh went to the hotel and we agreed um uh with those people that they will try somehow to track our bugs and get them to us so uh following day by God's grace um through your prayers our bugs go to us um only that brother Tim's bug was the last to come it came two days afterwards but all went well the Lord was good praise the name of the Lord so he answered your prayers right there so uh SL to Fe I am his child I am a child

praise the Lord amen well uh I think we just uh continue now we hope that the Lord will give us a good um stable supply of of power so I just want to before we go into the preaching of the word this evening to just um um give you a little testimony of the trip I'm trying to find the document here you you have it for me on the screen okay so uh I think we just use the I don't know something happened and I can't find it on my on my iPad but thank God that we have it on the screen so this is um uh the mission maybe the brother also online you can put that on online as well uh the testimony that I'm going to share is really close to my heart this evening and I'm praying that uh you pray for me that I I appreciate it in such a way that you'll be able to catch the burden for the work that is happening uh in aasa in Ethiopia that the Lord will be able to um uh you know late on your heart to pray for them and as you can see I'm tired still in the body you know I've been you know from all the way from October actually even earlier than October then we had our youth meetings and the youth camp and um ended no before our youth camp we we had pider meetings convention with the pastor from Zimbabwe after that then we I went to the Youth Camp after the Youth Camp then we went to carja after carja um where else did we go I think we went somewhere else ler yes went to L in the convention there with the youth lerat with the young people after L then now on to aasa in Ethiopia so then tomorrow morning very early in the morning we headed for uh cess again so for the introduction ceremony of sister of sister Konza and brother Alan actually brother langa is not here and the other a few Brothers they really helping them to work on that to organize because uh they are going to be going there so I need your prayers that the Lord will strengthen me uh that I'll be able to uh to not break down amen so I think I just uh begin with this Ethiopia mission trip report 2025 and I know the the brethren in Ethiopia a few of them could be following this service so we really send our greetings to you from here at dvf amen um brother if you can give me the next slide okay uh all right now here this first picture here uh brother Isaac you you you you have that you got that okay that first picture there is um maybe you would need to switch off these lights here uh I don't know can they be switched off for now and then you can put them on afterwards okay and then this one ah okay it's now it's now good so uh this picture here I know it's not very clear there for you who are here in the church uh but um if you see there are four gentlemen there this is 7 years ago this is 7 years ago on the extreme left is brother Ephraim that is me and then this is Brother K mesan and that is brother Timothy brother Timothy was at the time a brother from Kenya um and who had come to Ethiopia to work as an expatriate and he was um um at at the time 7 years ago uh managing or rather do I say managing or um for for lack of better word I can use that he was managing one of the factories there he was the engineer uh he was in charge of that factory a multinational uh company and he happened to to you know be working with this brother tesan that brother in the middle or rather on the other side 1 two three that brother tesan his name is tesan so he was working with him at the time and that brother uh was under him he was working with him in the same company but he was under him so that brother tesan believed the message um through the testimony of brother Tim and brother Tim over there brought him to to add Ababa where at the time I was the pastor of the church which was just starting out I think by that time we were about um 3 four 5 years I can I cannot recall so um so brother team would you know from aasa to Addis it's about 4 hours so brother team would travel all the way from Addis from aasa to come to Addis and he did that for a long time and he brought brother tesan we baptized brother tesan in in Adis Ababa um so but that was the only believer apart from the family of brother Tim brother tesan was the only believer in aasa at that time in the city of aasa at that time of this message I want you to imagine that so um so but you know when after a while but the team invited us he told me if you could come and visit us so so we went to visit them I would go many times with different Brothers but on this particular picture I had gone with brother brother ephra and of course to help me interpret when when whenever we are ministering with other people I see brother Ephraim was very young there I don't know about myself of course 7 years ago I was also younger than I am now can I have the next picture okay all right so if you just keep the pictures on and then just keep giving me the next one so right there you have this is 7 years ago and this picture here in particular I thought I should share this because on this trip 7 years later I traveled with Brother Gary Walker but on this picture seven years ago you see right there brother Gary Walker and his wife can you see that Brother Gary walk and his wife had visited Us in in the church in Adis Ababa having heard for a few years about what the Lord was doing in Ethiopia so he had come to visit us on the extreme left the here is Sister Bo carrying the baby of Sister Sister yodit at that time sister bues was just staying with sister yodit but now she's also a married a married sister these all people are now bigger and of course more more mature and married and so right there sister Deborah Walker the one who wrote that book uh that we were reading in the interview Brother Gary Walker brother gir there is the wife husband to Sister yodit then that is myself with the blue coat on and then brother Ephraim I don't know whether you can see him back there and then brother ased and then brother morgus so now these are are some of the brothers the ministering brothers that we had at the time um when we the church was just beginning at that time I I I think as I said 7 years ago the church was about I think three or 4 years old so this picture is so significant because 7 years after this I now went you can see all these brothers are preaching now all of them are preaching this message all of them are preaching this message and uh brother Ephraim back there he was the youngest of all of them as you can see it's even in the back he was the youngest of all of them but as you are going to see in the pictures I'm going to show you God has really really used him in such a special way can I have the the next picture Okay so that is uh now myself and brother Ephraim this is still seven years ago um um you know with his family right in the middle there is brother brother Salam who married the that sister next sister Betty who is the wife of B Salam the the the the sister to brother Ephraim I don't know whether I said that right so then over there the extreme right is the mother of U brother Ephraim so here we were at their home you know we're like family you know so we used many times to go visit them after they had received the message and we used to have a lot of fellowship at that time I think they were already married uh sister Betty and brother Salam can I have the the next picture okay now through the years this is 2019 um you see at this time I remember I I I had taken a picture and I I was holding my Bible so Aphra uh sent me this this picture or I don't remember was it that he sent it to me or he took it when I was there so he held his Bible and so I looked at him I don't know whether he remembers that and I told him ephra you look just like me in that picture you are going to preach this message he said amen and I wanted to see 2025 I don't know how many years later right there that is in his church on during this convention praise the name of the Lord all right let us get to the next picture okay so now this now is the haasa the haasa uh pictures which we took during this U uh during this uh trip the mission trip as you can see go back go back on that picture this is a young man 2019 with with an ambition with a Zeal to preach this message and spread it all over the country he did not know how God would use him but he had a burden in his heart to serve the Lord and take this message now give me the next picture here now you see all these brothers there apart from myself and brother Gary Walker and brother Team all these other brothers including the old man you are seeing there who is older than all of us there are working preaching this message under the ministry of brother ephra and here all these brothers have come to the message through brother Ephraim and there we were you know having a meeting with them you know he was always telling me the testimonies but I was like okay it is too good to be true but I'll have to go and see for myself so I was so amazed when these brothers came and they were asking very good questions and so we had some little Fellowship a few of them had already gone out I'll give you another picture with all the ministers okay can you can I have the next picture and please remember these are not the only Believers in Ethiopia there are other believers the first picture I showed you with all those Brothers Brother G brother aset brother mes God is also using them to do other works so here we are only talking about the work that God is using through brother ephra and so you see here um okay that is the picture in the Church of brother Ephraim in the convention there um that is myself brother Tim Brother Gary uh brother brother ephra and then one of those ministers uh there sitting sited with us can I have the next one okay uh so these are the people of the congregation as they are worshiping can I have the next one okay yeah you see you know all these are believers of the message they are not about to believe they're Believers of the message they have come through the to the message through the ministry of our brother there can I have the next picture okay now uh they had quite a few of them you know and they wearing like this they dressed these are are singers they choir you know all of them in that region dress that way when they're singing so so brother brother uh Gary was asking I think it was brother Tim asked me first who are those people who are dressed in in the same uniforms they all look Alik and I was like I sure don't know but I'll have to ask brother Ephraim so he told us well there they are it's a choir it's a choir this is in the church okay let's let's go to the next picture well most of these people are new to the message they're just um 1 2 3 years old I know God still has a lot more to do in aasa and in all these regions so this is the Convention as we were there we had about ephra Estates about a little more than 250 people that came he told he was expecting 500 but only 250 people came up and this is from they came from different towns where he has established different churches some churches are in homes some churches are they have places where they go but all these are believers of this message and they have come into this message in the last 3 years this is brother ephra the pulpit all right let's have the next picture okay that's myself I preached the first service there and my sermon was a man sent from God and I was I told Brother Gary you know you are the visor here on this trip but since this is the first convention here among these people and you know I'd like to lay a foundation for you I'm going to be the the John the Baptist in these meetings I'm going to preach the first service and I and I'll talk about a man sent from God and so I laid it out there and showed them how God has sent a prophet in this generation and it was a very good service people were attentive they listened and and they received the word gladly and you know uh Pastor ephra was telling me you know many of them were fearing and but U having received these meetings and these Services you know they received boldness they received boldness actually I heard from him was it today he said many of them are now going out to preach with fire let me have the next picture that's that's Pastor ephra interpreting for me okay he interpreted for us all the services uh let us have the next picture so this this is brother brother Gary he preached the next three services uh and he preached really very wonderful uh God led him in such a way that he exactly touched what the people the problem of the people you remember the service he preached for us here on Wednesday about confidence that's what he preached and the people were lacking especially the ministers and the people themselves they were lacking confidence talking about this message many of them were saying you know people are calling them a c and so now how can you evangelize when people are calling you a c they even fear to express themselves to go out but you know after he preached those sermon especially that about confidence ah you know all the fear left all the fear left praise the name of the Lord give us the next one and uh this is now the the okay just the pulpit area that's brother Ephraim on the pulpit give us the next one okay now this picture is the picture for all the ministers all the ministers now uh uh that I don't know whether all but I think most of them that are working under the ministry of brother Ephraim or I should say working with brother Ephraim they but they all I should say they all these ministers who are here they came to the message through the ministry of our brother there in aasa you can imagine the kind of labors that have gone into that uh so the these are all from of course the southern parts of Ethiopia in aasa area or or surrounding the city of aasa in different I I had written a few names here but I think I don't have them ready but uh uh a few of the towns surrounding our uh I could tell a few names a few names I can't remember so I'll just leave leave the names for that but all these are ministers or rather should say preachers of this message let us have the next picture okay now this is a few other ministers with their wives I think two sisters there are married to some of those ministers um some of them I think like this brother here he works with brother Ephraim in the church there I think as a deacon and um uh I don't want to mess their names up and all that let's have the next picture okay that's now us the ones who had visited together with the pastor of the church we we thought we should take a picture together okay let us have another one um so now this you know when I saw the the the the the magnitude of how God had used um the magnitude of the work and how God had used brother Ephraim you know you cannot rush to ordain a man unless God has ordained him we do not call God calls we do not ordain God ordains we do not establish God establishes we do not equip God equips so when God we don't even bless God blesses okay so when God blesses somebody what do you do you bless what God has blessed and so um you know we we thought we should uh uh ordain him in the ministry there with to before his people as a pastor of the work and you know all the people there unanimously said he has been and he is a blessing to us his ministry has been a blessing to us they all agreed and we really had a uh a very good atmosphere as we were praying there with him I think brother Gary is over the other side but we we D him together okay um can I have the next picture that is uh Pastor ephra now uh with his wife and little baby over there sister Emmanuela and uh you know we we had a very good really good quality time we spent together in Fellowship um not only during the services but after the services especially I had some really really uh quality time with ephra and his his family we really had a good time we thank God for that you can see those sign post which he calls his church the message of Grace tanaco and uh it's it's really uh a beautiful uh thing to see the message going out into into you know the interior of Ethiopia with the Ethiopians having the Ethiopians having the vision this is not a vision of another man this is the vision of an Ethiopian in Ethiopia preaching to Ethiopians praise the name of the Lord amen let's see another picture okay okay I think we already saw that if you can get to another one all right so now this is the farewell we just had a little breakfast there with Brother Gary brother Tim and this Brothers really I appreciate them because they are I I told them I said Brothers you did not only preach when you were on the pull pit you preached through your life these brothers are true true Christians and we had a very wonderful experience with them serving to uh God together there in Ethiopia do we have another one I think we have a few more ah is that is that all okay thank you God bless you do you do you appreciate that little report amen and um I think I should say this um and I think I should we should we can first read the scripture and then I'll give I'm still I think this whole service is all about a report I'm still giving the report it's Ethiopian mission report it's still in my mind in my heart we can stand together read Hebrews chapter 11 and then we can continue from where we stopped Hebrews 11: 24 and since uh I'm not being interpreted I hope I will be very quick so I will not I'll not keep you waiting Hebrews 11: 24 let us pray father Lord as we now face uh your holy word and to just read out of portions out of the Bible I pray that you would give me inspiration Lord give me utterance may I speak only according to the Oracles of God this evening in Jesus name I pray amen by faith Moses when he was born was heed three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible amen amen may the Lord add the blessing upon the reading of his word you may have your seats I think I should also say that uh uh we spent I I I I was able by God's grace also to meet a few Brothers in Adis Ababa who were able to make it to come and have some a little fellowship with us being that we only there for a few hours at the hotel and um every uh believer and Al all the brethren in aasa that we met sent you a warm greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and um reading this scripture I'm thinking about um brother Ephraim and his ministry there in aasa and what I have seen you know God do in the last three years in his life and Ministry to me when I saw what I saw I saw a miracle I saw a miracle I saw a miracle I saw what God can do uh with a man who has followed the leadership of the spirit and this evening I'm speaking on if you want to call my title the leadership of the spirit and you know uh some years ago I do not remember how many my wife I think she stepped out she could have reminded me uh when we first met brother Ephraim we went to their house his mother was there and sister and uh when he came out he was the first one to come and receive us and and uh I saw him coming in a distance and as I saw him the moment my eyes looked at him like this you know the Holy Spirit ministered to me that he would believe the message and he would be a preacher of it I mean this is a younger boy so you could not tell what the future would be it's only God who knows our future by the way it's not only God it's only God who can tell what your future would be it has nothing to do with a man unless the man unless God can reveal to a man so when I saw him like this I turned to my wife wife and I told her that this young man is going to believe the message and he will preach this message around this country and my wife you know believes in my Ministry so she thought that that was a prophetic utterance she said amen and the young man received us and the rest is history and so it reminds me you know he was the youngest of all the brothers when we we first reached out in a when we had the church there by the time we left he was the youngest of the brothers and he was still you know he was a basket B and you know getting into those things and then he left it when he came to the message and he desired to go and I'm sharing this testimony not only for for a testimony but also for an encouragement to especially the younger brothers who are here and who are doing nothing for the Lord you know he was a basketballer and with a lot of vibrancy and a lot of life and he was a very good he was very good in in basketball really but um you know when this message got a hold of him he left it all he he dropped it not to say that baset basketball is sin or sinful but you know when you get the revelation of the word everything else seems as nothing you want to surrender your life completely especially if you have a calling of God upon your life you want to surrender your life completely to that and forsake everything else just like I forsook everything else and decided I said I'm going to give my life to the Lord that he will use me as he desires as he wills and um later on of course he would get to be baptized and his family followed him um the were all baptized and now when we left Ethiopia because and the reason why we left Ethiopia is because uh they brought up a law a new rule when they say that now uh no one can no preacher foreign preacher can live in Ethiopia because to live in Ethiopia you have to to have a residence perit and all that and you have to you know renew it every year so they say to to be able to live in Ethiopia you need to have a a theology uh certificate or or seminary training for at least a year and then I I told my wife if I said um you know when God sent us to Ethiopia we do not have he did not send us in to Ethiopia on the basis of a theological uh uh College license Seminary how come that we want to stay here on this basis I told my wife it seems the door for us to stay here has come to an end it's closing may not necessarily mean our ministry in Ethiopia was closing but I felt strongly in my heart our time for staying cuz we when we went to Ethiopia we thought we would stay permanently at one point I even went to the immigration and I told them I am ready because they don't accept dual citizenship um I think uh if I'm not mistaken so they told us um I I told them rather that if you would like for me to change my citizenship I am ready to do that I was ready to even surrender my Ugandan citizenship so that I can become a citizen in Ethiopia and stay there not that Ethiopia was easy it was we to us and my wife it was one one of the hardest countries for us to ever live in not because the people were bad but because the the the culture the food the the like basically everything is almost the opposite of what we have here because here we have been westernized by colonization and everything so there it's a little bit different with with here so we thought we would stay there for forever and and at one point but then when this came after we had stayed there for about 6 seven years you know I um told my wife I think our time for staying here has come to an end and um and um you know we we we I I I spoke to a few Brothers they said no well some some some of them were saying well you can get you can even buy this paper from one of the Seminary Seminary or colleges and then you just tell them you are a theologian and you know they all they need is a paper but I thought that is forgery if I Forge that in order to preach I wouldn't even have the conscience to preach out of my heart I said I not do this in my clear mind I will not do this I am going to go back to Uganda I said I'm going to go back to Uganda and so I came back to Uganda and at that time um you know brother Ephraim was still in In Living with his parents in in in Addis um but then time came when he uh felt led and this is sovereignly I never had anything to do with it no one else had to do even his family never had anything to do with it he said I I feel led of the Lord to go and do a work a walk in aasa to just go in aasa and and and preach of course we were starting a little Fellowship there so maybe he thought he would um go and help them I don't know what he thought felt led of the Lord he told me I feel led to go to aasa so no one agreed with him because among many reasons one of the reasons was his age he was young okay so no one really agreed with him so he obeyed but he obeyed the leadership of God he obeyed the leadership of the spirit and he went to aasa and you know when he reached in aasa he was all by himself and you know having nobody having nothing and you know he meets this woman and of course he told this testimony here at the bench he meets this woman and this woman would come to him and tell him prophesy give him a false prophecy he said you going to die in a few days gave him even the number of days said you're going to die in so many days if you stay in aasa but uh he obeyed still the leadership of the spirit Brethren if the Holy Spirit ministers to you obey the leadership of the Holy Spirit even if you have to disagree with mother with father with with the uncle with with the pastor even with the with friend with the family it doesn't matter as long as you are obeying the leadership of the Holy Spirit there is something about the leadership of the spirit that I want to share with you tonight never he never had money he never had any resources he just simply went by faith he packed a few clothes he had and he went to AA now you have seen the fruit that came out what is that that is the fruit of a man obeying the leadership of the spirit praise the name of the Lord it reminds me when we first went to Ethiopia no one agreed with us no one you know uh even there was a man you know I I wouldn't want to say his name but you know he uh he told he told me you cannot come here you are very young you are not experienced you have been only preaching for a few years you cannot I cannot allow you here so I fa so broken but friends I still obey the the Holy Spirit leadership and when we went there you can now see what the Lord has done it's not about a man it's about the spirit when the Holy Spirit leads a man it is because he wants to use that man for him not for the man but for the for him to do something through that man and and so I asked today I asked brother Ephraim do you have can you give me some testimony of course he had been giving them for to me for a while so I needed to hear some of these testimonies of what the Lord had been doing over the years um or since he went there for for for about these three years and I have about four outstanding testimonies here that I would like to share with you and this really really moved my heart and one of them says he told me brother taera his name is was um his age was 120 120 a man of 120 years so his son his son his age is 70 years so this man came and was baptized this man of 70 years was bapti baptized and after he got baptized you know he reached out to his father of 120 years and this man of 120 years believed the message and and he after he had believed the message six months later he slept he slept believing well I don't know about you but I've never baptized a man of 120 years to me I thought that is a miracle because usually they believe when they are young not when they are old praise the name of the Lord and then he says here a man who works in the government office and alcoholic for 16 years un alcoholic for 16 years causing financial and emotional stress to his family brother ephra says I never prayed for him no one prayed for him but one day after a beautiful sermon he called it a beautiful sermon he said one day after a beautiful sermon on Sunday afternoon he came and told me he has a testimony he got out to the pull pit and exposed he exposed his problem of addiction and he said after coming to this church for one year regularly now I have not been taking alcohol for 2 months straight hallelujah amen yes that's a miracle and he gave me another testimony here and this is a powerful one it says there was a mother who had two boys and both of them were born ill I don't know I do not know what kind of illness but probably some of those who are born without maybe cerebral palcy I'm not too sure what the sickness was he says they can't they couldn't think straight I believe it is so he says we prayed for both of the boys for 9 months so they prayed for both of the boys for nine months uh that is an exercise of faith and and one and one boy was 18 years old so he got healed and now he's in school Hallelujah and he said they still praying for the other boy amen and and this other testimony says this is an outstanding testimony it says there's a doctor in aasa University his name is Dr ABA he says d director of a university so he has been against the student Fellowship in the university for many months but as the fellowship was going on one of the young brothers gave him the church age book after reading that he contacted him me he says and wanted to know more after receiving the message he told me he wanted to be baptized as he got baptized as he got baptized he says this man had a sight problem his eyes could not see well but as this man got baptized God gave him a Clear Sight after that amen and since that time he has since supported the student Fellowship in the university and you know the some of the student Believers were actually even at at the convention you know and he contributed in that in that convention this man this doctor he contributed the whole sound system and all the chairs of the convention Hallelujah now you're talking about the God of this message praise the name of the Lord when God calls you he equips you praise the name of the Lord and I want to read just tonight I just want to preach by reading a few quotes out of the message and I trust that it will be a blessing to you in the Ephesian Church age brother bam says something and tonight remember I'm speaking on the leadership of the spirit the leadership of the spirit tell your neighbor the leadership of the spirit and I had a reason why I shared those testimonies because we we are taking an example of someone that God has led by the by the spirit to go into some place and then see what God has done and now he says now now what was the spiritual climate brother bham asks the question this is I'm now quoting what was the spiritual climate of that church it had left its first love living its first love of the word of God was revealed to us as having fallen from its origin which was Pentecost meaning the origin of every church or the origin of the church is Pentecost but this church had fallen from its origin in plain English that means this church was in danger of being away from the leading of the Holy Spirit when the church is no longer under the leading of the holy spirit that church has already been uh or rather I should say is already in danger of being taken away from the original when the church is not following the leading of the Holy Ghost it is no longer under the control of the Holy Ghost but then he says this was exactly what took place after Moses LED Israel out of Egypt the way of God was to lead them by The Cloud of fire listen carefully the way of God now there is remember there is a way of God and a way of man the the things I'm going to share today are very very important especially for people who want to serve God you need to know how do I have to go what do I have to do it doesn't matter who you are you a woman man you know young and old listen he says the way of God was to lead them by The Cloud of fire this if it was it is and it will always be this is always the way of God the way of God was to lead them by The Cloud of fire uhhuh that's number one number two by prophetic utterance I wish I would get a quote here so that everybody of us can read it together brother this is in the church age book in particular the Ephesian Church age so he says the way of God was to lead them by The Cloud of Fire by prophetic utterance how many believe in the cloud of fire how many believe in prophetic utterances how many believe in miracles and signs amen he says the way of God and that I want to say has always been the way of God it will always be the way of God it will never change God's way is always to lead his church with a pillar of fire with a cloud of fire with prophetic utterance with Miracles and signs he says and God given Wonders that is the way of God to lead his church god- given wonders this was to be accomplished amen that's how God leads his church but how does he accomplish it he accomplishes it by what by God selected and God ordained and God equipped and God sent men amen not men listen he did not say men ordained God men selected go men equipped and Men sent no you know brother B in one of the quotes and many quotes he says if if man sent you let man do what support you are you message readers if man sent you let man do what if your church sent you let your church do what but if God sent you let God do what amen it means a church can send someone out right and it is okay it is okay we can say we want to send brother amam to go and and uh you know in where in paa we can say brother am we going to send you to paa if we send you to paa if we as a church send you to paa we have to support you we have to pay your way we have to uh you know pay all the needs that you you have there because the church has sent you all right and that's okay it's okay the church has sent you the church should take care of you but if God sends you then God should take care of you amen we have so many Church sent men but I am looking for God sent men I believe the church needs God sent men amen because these men are going to be God selected them amen God given them God ordained God equipped God sent man he says you know with the whole Camp amen the whole Camp the whole church being dominated by the Holy Ghost move the church should be dominated by the Holy Ghost move not by man move but by the Holy Ghost move I am showing you here today the difference between the denominations and The Message Church the message church or a message church is different from denominations The Message Church is the church that is Le or LED rather by God selected God ordained God equipped and God sent men and is dominated by a holy ghost move they rebelled what did they do they rebelled and wanted a set of rules these people the Jew the Israelites for them they wanted a set of rules they wanted the Creed to go by so they wanted a king then they wanted to be exactly like the world and they went into apostasy and Oblivion the prophet says that is exactly how the first church age started and it it will get listen this is a prophecy brother says it will get worse and worse until the holy spirit is completely rejected and God Must Destroy the people this is what he said this is what is say it will get worse and worse until the Holy Ghost is what completely rejected how many will believe if a man stands up and says God is leading me to go and do something how many will believe even Among Us the message Believers many times we simply want to play politics we simply want to pull people to our churches we simply want people to follow us or or be under us or control them but let me tell you brother sister amen that will destroy the people and that has always destroyed the people but brother bam here gives a prophecy and he says it will get worse and worse until the Holy Ghost completely is what rejected the church in the out there in the denominational world what did they do they rejected the Holy Ghost because they said God revealed to us and we believe a b CDE e f g z and that's all we believe and they have church manuals that's why in the message we have no church manual we are not let by Church manual we are not led by Constitution we are not led by by laws we are led by the Holy Ghost and the word we are not LED and ruled over by just men we are ruled over by the Holy Ghost I don't care what a man says if a man does not say what the Bible says then I don't want to hear it because if a man is led by the holy ghost He will always say what the word says see he says see how it started out in the early church it was called Deeds then it became a Doctrine it became the standard it became the unbelieving word the unbending way rather it finally took over and God was pushed aside oh it started so small so quietly so inoffensively it looked so good it seemed so sound then it caught a hold and like a Pyon like a Pyon it squeezed out every breath and killed all the spirituality there was in the church any the church that rejects the moving and the leadership of the Holy Spirit has rejected God praise God oh he says that false Vine is subtle it is like an angel of Light until it gets a hold on you now I want to say that I believe in leadership but it is not oh my God I wish Believers would say Amen to this brother bam says I believe in leadership everybody say I believe in leadership but he says it is not the leadership of men I believe in am I preaching to believer tonight I don't believe in the leadership of men ah I just told you I preached a man sent from God so are you now saying changing your mind that you no longer believe in the leadership of men yes I'm not changing my mind that's what I've always believed and that's what the prophet has always taught so does God use men oh yes he does so listen that's not all don't don't just walk away from from me right now listen to the to the rest of it it is not a leadership of men I believe in I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word amen oh you ought to shout Amen to that I believe also that God God has set men in the church men who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order I believe that I believe also that the church is ruled over by men that God sends to take charge God still sends men God still anoints men God still sends out his servants that will take charge of the church no man has a right to preach the gospel unless God has sent him out no man has a right to say he's preaching or to say he's setting a church or to say he's going somewhere unless he has had that say the Lord unless he has had an experience with God because God still sends men you see he says I believe that I believe also that the church is ruled over by men that God sends to take church but that rule everybody say that rule that rule is by what by the word not saying not I am your pastor do this no no no no no no no we are let me tell you we are above that we are we are way above that we don't follow men blindly no more amen we have been say oh my God we are being liberated by this message we are been set free by this message we are no longer following men blindly We are following men who are ruling Us by the word and by the Holy Ghost not by their ego not by their feelings not by their educational theology we are being led by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that's what this entire message is that rule is by the word so that it is not men really ruling but the spirit of God for the word and the spirit are one amen some of you came from those denominations where they threatened to take your name out of the book H where they threaten that you will go to hell if you leave where they said if you leave this church your blessings are remaining here but I am so glad no man has a key to my blessing I am so glad I have believed a message that is a super message amen how can they say that your blessing is with us no man has your blessing your blessing is with God actually your blessing is with the word if you leave the word you have left the blessing of God but if you stay with the word but the blessing of God can never leave you amen and so in Hebrews 13:7 it says remember them which have the rule over you they have the rule over you he's talking about the ministers the pastors the preachers right who have spoken unto you the word of God who Faith follow who Faith follow considering the end of their conversation so you see consider them respect them he means you know they have the rule over you honor them I believe in honoring men of God I believe in honoring pastors if a man come out even if he's not your pastor even if he's just a pastor in the body of Christ but not directly your pastor you have to honor him you have to respect him you don't have to you know people go back biting their Pastor they're get getting curses not because the man is big but because the man is is a servant of God even when your pastor does a mistake brother let God be the one to you know work on him you know God always wants to be the one to you know discipline his own servants you know this man this man of God comes up and his name was U you know Elisha and Elisha you know was having a bald head and these children are laughing at him oh bald head bald head he called the Sheep bearers to come out of the forest they ate all of them I think they were more than 80 right all of them they died what the man was angry yes it was the anger of a man of God but remember not a man a man of God so God honors the words of a man of God that's why we honor the men of God because we are fearing God Amen when when Moses broke the word did he not break the word he indeed broke the word word he went and married out of the word imagine he married you know a it's just like a pastor marrying out of another race you know our Prophet advises us to marry within our race do we believe that I take the prophet's advis as that say the Lord this is my opinion it's up to you to take it as what you want but me I took it as serious you know some many many young people they always like uh taking it as a as a joke say well we have only one rest as the rest of Believers yeah that's all right that's true it's doctrinally correct but brother bham gave an opinion and his opinion to me I would rather take his opinion than take my opinion I'd rather take his opinion than take your opinion so to you who wants to marry white you know a prophet gave us uh the advice what did he say he said God has a flower garden and it has red black yellow blue but they are all beautiful in his sight and and he said what would make a a black girl want to marry a white man for ance vers you would get a mixed a mixed rest which cannot reproduce itself so he says stay within your what stay within your race and it's an advice of a prophet and I take it and you find that if you mix the reses you find that this has a different culture this has a different culture and you know it is very difficult to reconcile so stay with us say the Lord when God sends a man honor him and listen to what he has to say are you hearing what I'm saying and so friends we believe in honoring Servants of God but make no mistake we don't believe in man manhandling the body of Christ man if man is is is is sent by God He will always respect by the way the only way one of the ways you can actually know that a man is sent by God he's a preacher he's a minister he's called by God He will always honor the body of Christ he will always honor the children of God he will never manhandle them he will never manhandle them and you know when we understand that then we can know look yes we are under this ministry but we are not having a rope in our neck all of us including our pastor is led by what by the spirit the spirit still leads God still leads God still speaks God is true can you say Amen to that now I told you I'm going to read a a few quotes and many out of the church age book but also other messages now listen to this one is out of the message leadership he says and Moses was a rich young ruler to become a pharaoh he was Pharaoh's son and was hair to the throne and he looked out to the impossible a bunch of m ders a bunch of slaves but by faith he saw the promise of God through the word that his people would s in a Strange Land for 400 years but would be brought out by a mighty hand he esteemed that he esteemed that Hallelujah he esteemed greater riches that greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt for he forsook Egypt not knowing where he was going he was led by Christ he forsook Egypt he was led by Christ I remember I was going to be a priest in the Anglican church right now I would have been having robes but when this revelation of this message came to me I forsook everything else I became crazy I said I want to be live this message I even want to become a preacher of this message I don't care where I am going friends if you forsake everything else for the cause of Christ you can never regret he was led by Christ amen it's very interesting and very wonderful for you to know that you are led by Christ and he said and he had his foot on the throne he could have been the next Pharaoh in Egypt you know oh my um I was just inspired by by this thought seeing what God did through the life of brother Ephraim and knowing very well that he he could have accomplished a lot of things if he had gone the other way around you know he got married here in Uganda probably his mother-in-law and the family and the the the wife and all others could probably be following or hear this later you know he he got married in Uganda and uh you know from from a family that is is um you know could be able to sustain him here and maybe get him to start life on and I tried to convince him and I know I said this public and that's okay I tried to convince him to come to Uganda cuz I knew I would be happy if he's close to me I said come on come here in Uganda and and you know and you know you can even go preach among the Ethiopian people and here who are in Uganda and stay here and live here and have a nice living and have a comfortable life you know he looked at me and I knew in Ethiopia it was going to be a little tough if he would decide to leave there with his family but you know he looked at me and he said I have a calling in my country among my people I looked at him I couldn't believe my eyes I couldn't believe my ears but you know as a a man I couldn't understand it but when I heard I have a leadership of the spirit to go and be among my people and Minister among them I said that's enough you don't need to tell me more if that's what you are giving me as a reason to live there then you have my support and I want to tell you Church always honor always respect always stand behind anybody that says God is leading them to do something you would rather support that and be wrong than to be found fighting against God you know Moses he had his foot on the throne he could have been the next Pharaoh in Egypt but he esteemed the reproach of Christ the reproach to be called the old one Amen to be called a fanatic to take the place with the maders and the Fanatics because he seen that how the scripture was promis to be fulfilled he saw what God was going to do you know when God calls you into doing something you see what others can't see it is made made real to you it is open to you you can understand it it's like you know it's an understanding you know the Bible says to know the kingdom of God to know is to understand to to see and the church he says wake up Church wake up can you see the same thing tonight the how that has been promised is on us esteem the reproach of Jesus Christ esteem it Greater riches esteem it he's talking to you now you have to esteem the reproach of Jesus Christ greater riches than all the fellowship of anything I had a man from the north of Ethiopia his name is brother okba I'm sure he might also be following I'm not I I think so and so this brother you know he was a deacon in in in in m in a full church one of the elders there but he had this message he got baptized God filled him with the Holy Ghost and he looked at me and said I cannot stay in this church I said brother if it's your decision and God is leading you to do it then do it he left he left the denomination and he has been fellowshipping you know with his family the rest of the family also believe the message and I believe God is going to call many more in that part of the of the country and he says esteem the reproach of Jesus Christ greater riches than all the fellowship of anything than all the fellowship of the denominations we left the beautiful churches we left the beautiful carpets we left the big buildings we left why we left the associations we left the the money we left everything why amen because we can esteem the reproach of Jesus greater than any other thing if it takes further now this is not my words this is Brother Bam's our prophet's words listen it says if it TT father if it TT mother if it TT Church anything else follow the leadership of the spirit may God help us Amen to follow always the leadership of the spirit you know you come to a place where it is tough and you say Lord what would you have me to do and you are sure you are being led by the spirit everything you do by the way you have to be led by the spirit if you're not led by the spirit you are led by something else and that's not God of course amen and you know someone may say God has told me to for you to do this don't just go and do it because God told them God has to tell you you have to be led by the spirit too you know and brother bam told us how to know the will of God how to be led by the spirit he said you pray over the matter you pray over the matter you say God what would you have me to do and sometimes when you pray you know you know you may not see a dream or or or see a vision or hear anything but you know you feel led to go a certain way just go right ahead if if you are wrong and the matter is in prayer God will correct you he will make sure you are not wrong as long as you prayed over it Hallelujah and in the pamon church age brother bam says something here he says so balam got Israel to for to commit fornication do you know that physical fornication is the very same spirit that lies in organized religion let me remove my court so that I can show you this properly if the holy spirit will help me tonight amen I'll be able to paint you a picture of what the message is hallelujah he said do you know that physical fornication physical fornication is the very same spirit that lies in organized religion now what is organized religion organized religion is what we call denomination and I'll tell you right here before I continue organized religion is what is led by man-made systems organized religion is what is led by man but not the word and the Holy Ghost but this message is not organized religion this message is beyond organized religion a pastor can backslide a preacher can backslide but we stay firm planted in Christ why because we are not under organized religion we are led by the word we are led by the Holy Ghost and then here he says so bam got Israel to commit fornication do you know that physical fornication is the very same spirit that lies in organized religion I said that the spirit of fornication is the spirit of organization and all fornicators will have their place in the Lake of Fire that includes the spiritual fornicators and we are going to see the spiritual fornicators tonight that is what God thinks of organization yes sir the whole malayah the whole and her daughters will be in the Lake of Fire and then he says denominations are not of God and let me ask you a question what is a denomination a denomination is oh God help us a denomination is a system that you know draws boundaries and it says if you are not a part of us if you are not a part of this group you are wrong that is a denomination that is a denomination that says everybody else is wrong we are the right ones oh God help us that that kind of spirit doesn't enter into the message you see they see other groups as backsliders because they don't see it the way their Pastor preaches it they see other groups as if they're wrong because they are not part of their group sometimes not even because they're preaching wrong Doctrine but because they're not part of their group andam says that is a denomination it's a spirit of organization but we have been liberated from that why because we are a nation under God we are not a nation under man look the if you want one if you want want to be a True Believer of the message you should take your eyes Beyond a man and look at what God is doing in your life in this hour this message amen is God being personalized in you it's not about a a denominational idea Doctrine or even understanding or Revelation no it is it is more than that it is Christ being personalized in your life it's not just some good teaching or some good ideas no it is God being made person in your life whereby you can be sure whatever you doing you are confident because you know God is leading you brother bam said I think it was in the second Church age he said that this man I think it was is was polyup said the polyup was supposed to be the church age messenger of that age but Iran as his student became the church age messenger why because polyup leaned towards organiz organized religion you see God hates it God hates it you see God hates it listen they never have been and never will be denominations are not of God they never have been and never will be when you get that attitude of saying we are the only ones and everybody's wrong listen dvf is not the only one there are many others we just a little PE on the beach your preacher is not the only one there are many other preachers who actually preaching the truth even the denominations the people who are in the denominations we don't hate them the denominations we hate that is not of God but the people who are there we love we love we want them to come and hear the truth it is a wrong spirit that denomination is a wrong spirit that separates the people of God into a hierarchy and ly okay it divides the church into hierarchy and ladyy and and it is therefore a wrong spirit that separates the people from the people okay so the other church and the other church and the other church and the other church is a wrong spirit separates the people from the people it's a spirit of denominationalism it's a Spirit uh of organized religion I'm so glad that God Set Me Free from that that God set you free from that because this message came to liberate Us by the way I don't know this denomination people wrote that song we have been liberated but we are the right people who were supposed to sing it we have been liberated from our bondage woo let our sons and our daughters let us sing our freedom why because we have being liberated from the chains of religion we can look over Amen to a brother who believes this message no matter which church they come from and we say that is my brother that is my sister we are the only system of religion in the world that operates amen under different kind of church leadership but we are the same body and we agree all over the world worldwide worldwide someone could come from as far as Australia come here and preach something that we all can say Amen what do you think that is and we are not controlled by a man-made system we don't a hierarchy we have no headquarter we are oh my God God himself disciplines his preachers he sends them he equips them he corrects them let me tell you this is what you call the message of the hour the message of the hour is not organized religion someone was telling me if you are saying that you don't have hierarchy you know one level level Lev up up to the upper level if you don't have that how do you correct pastors and preachers who go wrong we say we don't need we don't need hierarchy to correct them we have above we have above amen the only thing we have is the word is the Holy Ghost and as long as that man ve off the people will leave him in this message we are not followers of men and a man we are followers of God and the word and the Holy Ghost our Prophet brother bam set the precedent he said if I ever say anything that is not in the word leave it alone I tell you friends I'm so glad here we are not men loyalists there are people who worship they pastors more than Jesus we are you you did not leave your denomination to come here and worship your pastor I don't want you to worship me I want you to worship this word I want you to worship Jesus who died for you who rose again who is alive today and can actually change your life are you hearing me be a Jesus loyal man if I'm loyal to him and you are loyal to him then we are going to be loyal to each other Hallelujah H you can call me crazy but I know what I'm talking about I know where I am standing listen let me read you a little more here he says denominations are not of God they never have been and never will be it is a wrong spirit that separates the people from of God into hierarchy and ly and it is there a wrong spirit that separates the people from the people that is what organization and denominations do in organizing they separate themselves from the word of God and bring themselves into spiritual adultery my God whereby they think they the husbands of the church ah if you want to quot the message and preach a wrong doctr it is possible you can even take this Bible and and quote and preach a wrong Doctrine you see you've had those they want to qu the pastor is the husband of the church no no is the husband in such a way that he is the carrier of the seed he doesn't have the seed of his own seed but he has the seed of the word okay so it's not that it's not that when you when you have to bow to the man you have to bow to the god in the man so we we always have to see beyond you see you can easily miss it you have to see beyond there are some others who devalue pastors and step on them and say he's just like me no he's not like you he different it's called by God is special butam say is a special man right every preacher is a special man he not he's not he's not a common right but look it's not about him it's about he who is in him now I'll read for you from the saman church age here what it says consider the thought of blasphemy these of Saturn's synagogue we are not blaspheming God in this instance though that goes without saying but they were blaspheming the true church so there was certain synagogue in thean church age and brother bam says this in this in the in this synagogue meaning it was also a church but the false Church system so they were now blaspheming the true church that those two Church systems will always be together those two seed lines the false Vine and the True Vine they will always move together that's what you're going to see working now when they talk about um the World Council of churches and they will try to divide Us by that the false Church system will be the majority they would say if these other ones don't join us they are the they the cult we should kill them we should remove the license we should do this and now the church shall be persecuted but I am not going to wait until that time happens because I will be up in up yonder I'll have to go in the Rapture I won't wait for that because that will happen the tribulation I'll not be here my my my so that's why we are preaching the way we we can we cannot allow anything or anyone to stop us we are the Unstoppable by don't let anyone or a condition stop you from witnessing about Christ you only have a short time brother Ivan soon you will be dead or you'll be long gone but while you have the time go and preach go and witness go and live the word be a witness however way you can be allow the Holy Spirit to lead you you see here it says you know but they were blaspheming the true church suddenly as Cain persecuted and killed Abel because he came was of that Wicked one and as the dead former judaic followers Jesus said they were of their father the devil they tried to destroy the Christians in the first few years of the first age now this same group the first Vine is even more strongly attempting to destroy the True Believer in the second age and I want to say even in our age this Antichrist system will try to destroy the True Believer and in every age in every place this Antichrist spirit will be there following the right move of God to try and Destroy them and squeeze life out of them but that and he says that Antichrist spirit is growing and now I I can say it has grown now it is ripe listen listen the group that inched its way ever so slowly into the church by its Deeds do you remember the Deeds the Deeds of the what of the nicolan do you remember what nicolan means nicolan is a spirit that wants to control the people man controlling the don't go there don't do that don't believe that don't accept that don't do that don't don't don't don't don't so you see man is fearing oh my pastor oh my church oh my my Reverend oh my Bishop oh my so you see they suppressed and they told dogmas and Creeds that are not in the bible let me tell you don't believe what I'm telling you because I'm your pastor believe it because is in the word or else you'll be found to be under the spirit of nicolan you see it's a it became a de so now it was at this time no longer fearing exposure but it openly organized in a group of its own assembling and is coming against the true church in un undisguised hostility now when I said this was unorganized Antichrist church I am giving you the truth from the authentic history authenticated history listen this is I'm quoting for you are you hearing what I'm saying the first church founded in Rome we will tress its history in the pamman church age it had already turned the truth of God into a Lie by introducing a Pagan religion with Christian names and meaning by the second age it was so Pagan though claiming to be the true church that polyup came about 1,500 years and 100 miles at a very old age this guy was a very old man at this time he walked and moved for 1,500 miles you know and he came to plead with them to turn back to the original they would not do it they had a solid hierarchy it's just like going to the Catholic church now or the Anglican church or one of those denominations and tell them to break their hierarchies and hear the word brother G told me a testimony that moved me he said he almost baptized a Catholic priest and the way it happened was you know he preached to this guy and this guy was like ah is that in the Bible I've never seen it ah and then uh the next thing was like yeah yeah sure I can do it this the one and then he was like oh wait and then the man said no we can't question the church and that's how he missed it that's how he missed it you see he they would not do turn back to the original they had they had a solid hierarchy and a solid organ ization and a complete departure from the word this then is Saturn's synagogue full of blasphemy in which we in which we already the seeds of the doctrine of the nanism that's why you cannot you cannot change a denomination but you can change the people in the denominations we are not called to go and preach the denominations but we are called to go and tell the people who are there come out of all my people don't be partakers of our sins Hallelujah and then it says in which were already the seeds of the of and which would shortly be the actual seed or the power of satanic religion and this is exactly right for Revelation 22:9 B he says does not say these people of certain synagogue but it says it says they it says but it says they are they are not the people of but they are sat synagogue itself now let me continue here it says this Spirit of antichrist is not new this is not something that just came in the church ages it has been here all along to get a clear understanding of how it works how it it goes against God and taxes and sorry and takes over in the church you know it can take over even in a message church or even in any church if they're not careful how it takes over in the church look if you want to know look at the Old Testament and see it there let us exam in this Spirit as it was manifested in Israel as she came out of Egypt to the church to be the church in the wilderness and whenever the church is coming out of Egypt that Spirit also comes whenever that church is coming out of Egypt Whenever there is a beginning of a church that Spirit comes so ministers have to watch churches have to watch pastors have to watch just as the early church started out under the pure Ministry of the holy spirit with signs and wonders and manifestations such as prophecy tongues interpretation wisdom knowledge and healing so in the days of Israel when they left Egypt they were under the leadership of what of the spirit of God manifesting in the gifts I want the same spirit of God manifesting in the gifts signs and wonders in our midst God was the leader of the people everybody say God was the leader and he says actually he was their King he was a father King he took care of Israel like a man cares for his family he fed them F their battles smooth away their difficulties and settled their problems he will do the same for you a church that trusts in God that believes in God God will the same for them Hallelujah they are preachers who cannot preach unless they have financial support they can't preach unless someone gives them money to start a church I've just showed you the pictures here this is a work that started not because this man or this young man was pumped up with money but because he was oby the leadership of the spirit and let me tell you even our church here has started the same way it's the same Holy Ghost it's the same fire some of you are sited here are preachers and will go start churches but you know it should start the same way God should be behind you to vindicate himself to prove I am the Lord and I fail not to prove is the same yester done forever he just busy himself over them they were the only oh my God oh my God God bused himself over them I want God to busy himself over us woo they were the only nation to which he was truly God we the message Believers are the only nation are the only church to which God is truly God but you see one day Israel the Israel the church Israel they got looking around and they saw the Philistines and other nations with Kings over them so it caught their eyes and they decided that they ought to humanize their leadership so they wanted a king now God was going to humanize the leadership himself in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ but they got ahead of him Satan knew the plan of God so he puts it in the hearts of the people to get ahead of God the word you see even in a family you the man you are not the leader you are not the ruler ah if you do that you as a man you have a spirit of nanism on you now that's I I've taken to another level now you the husband you must be inspired by the Holy Ghost to lead your wife to lead your family you must be under the unction of the power of the Holy Ghost because you see like the pastor is not the man the leader himself right he must be under the power of the Holy Ghost and the what and the word same way Same Spirit but when you say when you get to say me I am your husband I have said not going to church today okay let me ask you where is it in the Bible that your wife should not go to church when you have saved the Bible says that all Saints should what should attend church without forsaking it right now you you have a spirited of nianis that's why you are stopping your wife from going to church you see you are conquering her you are conquering her we are not conquerors of our wives amen the Holy Ghost in us should lead us Amen to rule over our families with love amen as Christ cherishes and loves his wife we too should love our wives and cherish them because they a part of us you see it's the same thing you you find also women sometimes they have a spirit of Jezebel on them a spirit of Jezebel is that one which does not listen to the husband you know it wants to control and sit you know it was seated upon many Waters Spirit of Jezebel spirit of denominationalism and Rel comes upon a woman and she can't listen to her to her husband and she says I have my own my own money my own this my own spia Spirit ofia it has taken over you see I have my own this my own my you as a sister as a woman you don't have anything of your own you have your lord and your lord is your husband you must submit 100% not 99 but 100% just like the church submits to Christ 100% the church have nothing of its own the church is at the mercies of Jesus Christ the husband the head the church is the body and he is the savior of the body so you see it says when they approached oh my I did not notice that it is 8:37 just give me a few more minutes and try to wrap this up and when they approach Samuel ask and asked I must have missed you H I'm preaching endlessly ah let me try to to see how to are you enjoying this tonight church when they approached Samuel and asked for a King Samuel was so dismay that his heart almost failed him God had been leading his people through this consecrated scripture Vindicated prophet and he felt that he had been rejected so he gathered the people and pleaded with them not to turn away from The God Who had carried them like children and prospered them and blessed them but they persisted so they say to Samuel you have never been wrong in your leading you have never been dishonest in your financial dealings you have not done your best to keep us in line with the word of God we appreciate the Miracles wisdom provision and protection of God we believe in it we like it and furthermore we don't want to be without it but it's just what we want a king to lead us to battle now of course when we go out to battle it is still Our intention to have the priests go with Judah with Judah following and and we will blow the trumpets and shout and sing We don't intend to stop any of that but but we want a king who is one of us to lead us and God said to Samuel see they have not rejected you but they have rejected me from ruling over them God wants to be the ruler over his own church can you say amen God Wants to Rule you brother God Wants to Rule you sister can you say Amen to that you should submit yourself to the rulers of God he wants to be the leader of your life how tragic that was L did they realize that when they were asking God to let them be like the rest of the world they were rejecting him because God had ordained that his people act different from the world they are not of the world and they don't like look like the world we are not of the world don't even look like the world they don't act like the world can you say Amen to that if you believe it they are crucified unto the world and the world is crucified unto them amen you see the one difference between Israel now I'm trying to bring it to a close can you follow me as we trying to landar this plane tonight you see the one difference between Israel and the rest of the Nations was what God put God to one side and Israel was like any other Nation when Samson cut off his hair he was like any other man put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with God is name attached to it you see now if you put the leadership of the Holy Spirit aside you are nothing but an organized religion the world and the church are all of the same lamp just like Jacob and Esau were of the same parents but the spirit of God makes the difference woo it doesn't matter if you call yourself a Christian anyone can do that the point is where all not you have the spirit of God in you for without that Spirit you are a Repro without that SP your what it's not my words you are none of his H and he says now not too long ago I asked a lady if she you know let me tell you this this just came to me right now the church is not led by program the church is not by even even if me as your pastor I will call you I say s come now what we going to do here you have to sing only one song you invite one special song and then now we do this and then the song the special singers tell them not to also sing for more than a minute and then now you come you see you are led by the word by the pastor so the pastor has given you program program is good oh I'm not saying it's not good it's good oh if you not have program you're going to be unprogrammed and if you don't have program you're going to be confused right so you need program but we are not led by program we are led by the spirit so you will come and a sister will sing a song and people will go in prayer people will and then you you would say sister it's more than a minute it's more than a minute give me the microphone ah brother you are not led by the spirit you Le by your pastor you see so the song Lead has to be lad by the Holy Spirit Pastor has to be lad by the Holy Spirit musicians have to be led by the Holy Spirit everybody has to be le by the Holy Spirit you see because you know you have to to do d d d do three times and then you you you do it and the Holy Spirit leaves no you have to flow you if you're playing flow with the spirit know what you are doing let the Holy Spirit lead you if you a wife be leid by the spirit if your husband be Leed by the spirit if your preacher a pastor be led by the spirit may God help us Church to be Leed by the Holy Spirit hallelujah oh my oh my I want to try and finish I want to try and finish I have about a paragraph or so let me let me bring it to a close if the plan doesn't Lear properly some of you may suffocate let me just finish this properly says not too long ago I asked a lady if she was a Christian she said to me I will have you know sir that I burn a candle every night and then he said what in the world has it got to do with it he says I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist I'm a Pentecostal I'm a I'm a dvf member so what that hasn't a thing to do with it it is the holy ghost or Parish well starting way back there in the first church the people got to thinking and reasoning how to improve on God the Deeds of the nians began showing themselves then a group formed they drifted away from the pattern of the word and all it takes is just one word changed and all that little even then livens the whole lamb he that he that offends e in one point of the law is guilty of all Eve just changed one word that will do it and when that certain centered group was formed it began to Hur and fight through Believers insisting they were aliens that they were the yet they were the church of god notice how organization breeds hatred did you hear that organization does what the way you know people are coming from a church where they're being fed on the word when they meet you who is coming from another church they will have so much love for you as if they come from the same church whereby you meet a brother from evening light and you see him as your brother from the same church whereby you meet a brother from whatever church and you love him and see him as your brother but you see where you H someone there is a wrong Spirit of organized religion on you and you need to repent you see you must always have love the says if you have love one for another then the world will know you are mighty disciples my God give us love love for one another love for our brothers love for our sisters no matter which church they attain I don't want to know about their Church even if their Doctrine is a little bit different from ours I don't care as long as they believe this word they are my brothers that's why our Prophet told us the only bis of this Fellowship is Anan living it is not even wrong Doctrine a person can believe some wrong Doctrine but as long as they're your brother they your brother brother leave that long doct alone and still love them even if they are in the denominations love them don't just say this one is from Miracle Center no if he claims to believe Jesus receive him warmly and love him even if he has she has earings on whatever love her anyhow and the love of Christ in you will attract her to know about your God and she will believe she'll be baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the earrings will get lost but you see we have got our self righteous religion thinking we have it all and we are the best and nobody else has it like us that is the spirit of organized religion it is not the spirit of Jesus Christ you see friends we have to love one another now love does not mean you do what they do no brother bam said the only basis of excommunication or disfellowship is someone who is living unclean life and refusing to repent not even even if he lives unclean life and he depents his right but we're talking about the person who lives anle life and is CAU and is refusing to accept it is refusing to repent and he's continuing to live that kind of life that one he he should be excommunicated like in a lightening because he's going to bring a wrong speed among us but you see wrong Doctrine is not a basis for disfellowship is not a basis for excommunication we must always love our brother even if they believe something that we don't believe oh dvf may you receive this in your hearts see you should love your brother love your sister because you see if they see us that we have love for one another they will know we are his disciples you see not is how organization breeds hatred organization is the one which what brings hatred it destroys Fellowship it makes bitterness it makes bitterness these are things are in the message they're not my inventions that is what m means this is what smana was full of bitterness a root of bitterness defiles many so more and more defilement was coming in as musicians come every age would feel the scars of bitterness and even our age even our generation is feeling the scars of bitterness you find people having bitterness against each other may God help us Brethren to love one another from our hearts whether I I understand what the brother understands or whether I disagree with him or whether he comes from another fellowship I don't agree it's all right it's all right it's all right Christ died for them he died for me too I know what I believe you see some people hate others and they are bitter and they they u a lot why because they are not confident but the G told us confidence without ego you love each other and you're confident where you are you're like he believes to LS he believes for he believes oh he's going to change me oh come on be confident in what you are and what you believe right yes doesn't mean that oh I love my brother who is a Catholic until I I go to attend this Catholic Church there is a problem with you that's not love because love covers a multitude of sins but it does not rejoice in iniquity see see so when you see someone who you know believe in the wrong stuff you will love them to correct them love is correct corve you not love them to deal with what they doing but you to to agree with them but you love them to correct them and friends the leadership of the Holy Spirit pays off when I saw what God has done in aasa and what God is doing in that young man's life I marveled I marveled I marveled because I saw I said truly these things is what brother abam said it works he went to aasa when no no one believed in him I quite frankly I told him I'm behind you I support you but I also had my questions but you see it was God's leadership and God stood behind that and you've seen those pictures and now we can stand with what God is standing with because it is out of the leadership of the Holy Spirit and that's what we need to do we need to be led by the spirit we need to be led by the spirit we were led by the spirit to start a fellowship in an but you see I was led by the spirit to start that Fellowship to open the door there I do not know how many will come there but you can be led by the Holy Spirit to always come there and support to send money and to do whatever even if you're giving an offering be laid by the spirit don't just give four you just say this one 50 is much let me give 20 you see you being led by flesh but if you led by the spirit you will pray say God what would you have me give sometimes we talk about needs here oh there is a need to there's a need but you pray say oh God what would you have me to give right now this church needs a lot of things the church in in in haasa they need a lot of things they need a church building of their own they need even before they get there they need rent of a good place a good building and they you know they need a lot of a lot of resources but you see if you hear things like that you say oh God what would you have me to do it might be just something very little but if the Holy Spirit has led you to do it he knows where exactly it is going to go praise God hallelujah let us stand on our feet just feel our presence of the Holy Spirit here with us tonight oh God help us to be led by the [Music] spirit help us [Music] Jesus many times we are led by our own egos or our own ideas or our own Ambitions many times we make wrong decisions based on our feelings but we understand it has nothing to do with us Jesus it has
