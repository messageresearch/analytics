speak in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you and also to you the Saints on Zoom I'm speaking to evening light by tabernac as well praise God so we would like to continue with Malachi 4 5 so maybe today we can begin from vers one if you do not know where Malachi is it is the last book in the Old Testament [Music] we will begin from verse one of chapter 4 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud year and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of HS that it shall leave them neither root nor branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness rise arise with healing in in his wings and he shall go forth and grow up as sces of the stall and he shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts remember ye the Lord Moses my servant which I commanded him in horb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the Great and the Dreadful day of the Lord and it shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to the their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse amen you may be seated so this evening by God's grace I'm speaking to you on again the Ministry of elah in the end time this scripture which we have read tonight it is a prophecy and you know one thing about prophecy whether people know it or not it comes to pass whether you believe it or not it comes to pass prophecy is prophecy and prophecy happens regardless of what anybody thinks about it so the prophet that is spoken of here in the Book of Malachi is the one that the Bible speaks of that it would come before the day of the Lord in Mali here it says the day that shall burn as an [Music] oven is coming a day a day that will burn as an oven and the Bible says all the proud and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and that day that comes shall bur them up it shall leave them neither root nor Branch now we know that that day has not yet come and that day is coming and how does it begin it begins with the tribulation you see it will be the day of Vengeance of our God whereby those who refuse to believe those who refuse to believe the message of Elijah in the end time will have to pay with with their own blood and uh we thank God because Jesus Christ has a way for those that fear his name and those amen that Shall Believe on him it says the son of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings and I believe that in this end time the son of God's righteousness Rison as as rose up brother to us with healing in his wings this enti message that we have received is healing in God's Wings in the Book of Revelation chapter three it talks about for the eyes if you were blind that you would be able to see so it comes with healing when God brings his word his word comes with healing healing not only for your body but healing for your soul how many appreciate God's healing for their souls tonight and now there are many people who will not actually see that God has has a promise for our end time and they think things are just happening but we know that things are not just happening we are walking in Prophecy even here we are walking in Prophecy even tonight we are walking in Prophecy did you know that the Bible say there is nothing new on Earth everything that is has been and everything that has been shall be so there's nothing new that's why God can never be surprised you know whatever happens God knew it before the foundation of the world and he knew that the world in the end time would be in the condition it is in today and that it would leave the principles of the word and that's why he promised a Ministry of to come and restore them back again now before we go into studying the ministry of Elijah in the end time because that is also a part on its [Music] own a while now I've been dealing with the ministry of Elijah in the beginning uh because if we get to know or to understand perfectly how the ministry of Elijah worked in the beginning then we will surely understand without a doubt the ministry of elah in the end time is that aen church so now we understand here that when God sent Elijah in the beginning we' gone through it over and over that it was a time when Israel had Backle when Israel had left the principles of the word and so God sent Elijah bring back the things in order and we have read a few accounts on Elijah and today we shall read one more but before we read that in the book of First Kings 17 I'd like us to look at what brother bam has to say a little bit about Jezebel because at the time when Elijah came you know the king Ahab had decided to marry a woman from among the [Music] unbelievers and really from this we should learn that Believers always Mar believers praise God because when the king decided to marry an unbeliever he also with her and he left the glory of God and Jezebel took up the place which was not supposed to take up the listen the earliest place you can see in the Bible of a woman preacher is Eve when Eve was preaching you remember what happened you remember what happened when Eve preached because when the serpent came Eve started preaching to The Serpent and the Bible says the serpent was more subtle than any other Beast that the Lord God had met but Eve started preaching to the serpent and she was overly excited and she decided to add more words and she said that he said that we should not even touch it and when the woman added on the word the serpent took away from the word because the serpent said You shall surely not die and that was taking away from the world but you see the serpent could not defeat the woman unless the woman had first left her place in the word so she had to First leave her place for the serent to be able to penetrate her her faith as long as the Bride of Jesus in this end time can stay with the word devil will try to fight but he cannot Prevail that's why Jesus in The Book of Matthew says that Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail why do you think they will not Prevail is it because you are so powerful or because you are so solid on your faith remember now we are living in a generation or time of sin but at the time of Eve there was no sin you know Eve was the first one to sin in the book of First Timothy chapter chapter 3 the Bible says the woman was in the transgression not the man but the woman she was the very first one to see so in other words she was as perfect almost as Adam was were holy so how come that they could fall how come that Eve could fall away from that Perfection yet she was that perfect and that powerful solid on the face the only thing that made he fall was that she she went away from her place she was removed from her place and what was her place her place was absolute faith in the word of God and what is the original sin the original sin is unbelief stopped believing the word and when she stopped believing the word she added on the word and then what came out of it as a result the adultery was a result of sin was the fruit of sin and so if that way she lost her first estate Adam too lost his first estate and now the Bible says for all have sinned but yet we see again the Bible saying you know speaking of Jesus and he said that Jesus was the uh you know was the new creation of God now listen through through Adam the first Adam all men sin through Adam the second all men receive the new birth because you are born in your first nature you are born with the nature of sin you did not choose it it chose you so you are not you are not a sinner by by choice that much you are a sinner by Nature Apostle Paul said it this way you were you were children of Wrath by Nature children of WRA Born to Die born in sin but there is another birth whoever hears the message whoever hear has the gospel she will be like Mary now amen when when the angel of the Lord came and Mary heard the words of the Angel Mary accepted she said be it unto me according to your word she accepted all the word and because she accepted all the word she stayed in her place her place of Faith the place of the church is the place of Faith your place is to believe every word but the moment you move away from that you are no longer a Believer you are backing and that's why you see all the teachings we have in our generation because the church has Backle through their denominational doctrines people will stop will not believe what you telling them not because they are using the filter of the word but because they're using the filter of their Church doctrines so these things are very important that I'm speaking in in this series really and I'm going to hammer it continually until the Lord will reveal them personally to each of us we need to understand the ministry of Elijah in the end time praise the name of the Lord and then there is a second Eve the first Eve fell hallelujah hallelujah through the first Adam all received death but through the second Eve rather through the second Adam all attained eternal life who is the second Adam Jesus Christ and who is the second Eve the church we are the second Eve but what has happened the second Eve she has back the church has back but God promised a restoration within the church within the the church God calls out a bride who cannot fall cannot backslide regardless of all that she goes through it has already been written in glory that she will overcome I believe I am part of that bride who will hear every word of God and then after Eve the second woman preacher we see wasel Jezebel was one of the women that actually thought that she would teach the prophets of God and before I continue I'll tell you right away that Jezebel is a type of of the religious order of Our Generation because spiritually speaking the church is a woman a woman is a type of the church so when you hear Jezebel we are talking about the church and and what the church when Jezebel came with her wrong doctrines making the king and Israel to backslide God had a had a way out for his children and last time we talked about constantin's idea you know the first when the first denomination was formed and we talked about how Jezebel married Ahab and this Union was was against the scripture the word it was aop political union was not based on the word and the union listen the union of Jezebel and spiritually speaking is like the union that took place in the third century between Constantin and the church Constantine was a politician who actually United the church with politics and and and if you notice brother says it was Constantine's idea to get everyone together the pagans the nominal Christians and the true Christians because we had those ones who were calling themselves Christians but not the true ones and we had the pagans and we had the true Christians but it was the idea of Emperor constan bring all of them together and for a while it looked as if he would succeed for the real Believers came along to see if they could bring back the ones that had drifted away from the word let me tell you this many times when you tell someone the truth and some of you have tried to testify can also testify to this when you tell someone the truth usually the first thing some people will say oh this is the truth I am going to go and change my denomination I'm going to go and and I will not come out but I will remain change them you know you cannot change a dead system but says when they denominate they die if they decid to baptize younger babies you cannot change that there is only always one solution separation always the word of God listen the word of God calls for a total separation total separation from unbelief you cannot you cannot stay United with unbelief and then you think that God will use you you know just like people who want to keep friendship with the world the Bible says friendship with the world is enity with God we the word of God calls us to come to a place of total separation not some separation total separation from unbelief separation from the world toal separation from denominations listen that's why the Church of of Jesus Christ should never come into any Unity with any denomination that's why we can never be under any umbrella any denomination that's why brother bam told that every Church every local church is Sovereign and the past of that church is the final Authority the past of that church he also uses the word and the Holy Spirit so really every member of the church is under one thing the word and the Holy Ghost that's the final authority of every Fellowship but we see here they try to unite and to be under to be together and the Believers thought H let us go we shall bring them back again to the truth but when they saw that they couldn't bring them back into the truth they were forced to break away from the body political then when they did they were called Heretics and persecuted some people when they believe this message they don't want to be persecuted they don't want to be called Heretics but the True Church of Jesus Christ has always called been persecuted and always called let me tell you if the world or the friends in the world love you the same way before you believed there is something wrong somewhere if your friends don't find fault with you if they can't call you names they can't persecute you in any way it simply means they your friends and how can you be a friend with an idea that you don't stand for let me give you an example if you used to dress a certain way before you believe the message and in the world and you still be dressed the same way and you know you you have no problem with you you have no problem with them so it means you are still friends you are having Fellowship two fellows in a ship but when you believe Jesus Christ you should change he should change everywhere about you the way you dress they must be able to see it and they must be able to notice that there has been a change there is a song we used we sing that I've been changed I've been reborn all my life has been rearranged what a difference it made when Jesus came my way can can you be able to give that testimony when you come to Christ you must have a testimony of a change the world should not see you the same way you should not see things the same way there must be a permanent a permanent change and he continues on to say let me say right here that we have the very same thing going on right now the people are all coming together they are writing a Bible that will suit everyone whether it be a Jew Catholic or Protestant they have their only Council but they call it the ecumenical council and do you know whom all these organizations [Music] fight they fight listen they fight the true Pentecostal they don't fight Pentecostal they fight the true Pentecostals who are the true Pentecost who are the true pentec I want to say I am the true Pentecost the Bride of Jesus Christ is the true Pentecost the believer are the true Pentecostal and the whole agenda of Satan is against those true Pentecostal in the Days of Elijah Elijah was the true Pentecost a man that could pray and fire comes down that was a true Pentecostal a man that would go and R would feed him a man that would see Visions a man that would hear the voice of God a man that would you know be in the presence of God a man that would give a prophecy and it comes to pass I said that is a true Pentecostal and that is what the church needs that's why the Bride of Jesus should always not be far from that the true church of the end times will not be far from Acts chapter 2 they will be right there through Bible bestas Pentecostal having the same word having the same power having the same SS and wonders having the same manifestations having the same way that is how you know the true church when they have the same God of Elijah when when when when Elijah left the power never left the spirit of Elijah stay or the spirit which was on Elijah which is the spirit of Jesus Christ which is the spirit of God himself and I am so happy that I'm a true Pentecostal praise God and he continues on to say they fight the through Pentecostals I don't mean the organization called Pentecostal I mean the ones who are Pentecostal because they are filled with the Holy Ghost because they are filled with the Holy Ghost oh hallelujah hallelujah and they have the signs and the gifts in their Med because they walk in truth oh God bless you my brothers and sisters this should we should hunger for this if you're not seeing it in your mid don't say it is no longer here it is still here if you don't have it hunger for it if you don't have it you know desire it let me say this we we still believe in signs and gifts we believe in the Holy Ghost we believe in we believe in being filled with the Holy Ghost we believe in Walking In Truth says here those are the true Pentecostals praise God when I have married Jezebel for political reasons he sold his birth right you join up with organization and you sell your birth brother whether you want to believe it or not every Protestant group that ever came out and then went back sold their birth [Music] right and when you sell your birth R you are just like you can cry and repent all you want but it won't do you any good there is only one thing you can do and that is come out of her my people and stop taking over sin now if you don't think I am right just answer this one question can any man living tell me what church or what move of God ever had Revival and came back after she went into an organization and became a denomination read your histories you can't find not even one it was the Midnight Hour for Israel when she joined with the world and left the spiritual for the [Music] political it was the Midnight Hour of atesia when the church did the same thing it is the Midnight Hour now that the church are coming together the churches are coming together have you not heard about the world ccil of churches even he what you seeing happening in our country church is coming together ask yourself how can they be United when they don't believe the same thing how Unity is the unity of the faith we must have Unity of the faith but what they are having is unity of denominations Unity of denominations can never bring Unity of the faith and that's why all of them put together they cannot even believe in baptism in the the name of our Lord Jesus Christ they cannot believe things that are spoken in the Bible each of them has their Doctrine and brother bam says it is the Midnight Hour end time now when married Jezebel he he allowed that to take the money and erect two huge houses of worship of and B the one that was erected for Bal was big enough for all Israel to come and worship there at and when Constantine and the church married gave the church buildings and set up altars and images and organized the hierarchy that had already been shaping up when Jezebel got the power of the state behind her she forced her religion on the people that killed the prophets and the priests of God listen Church what we call the what we call the one world order it is coming one world religion One World Government these things are not it is going to happen be prepared get ready for the Rapture because if you are not ready it will happen and you will not because you're hearing it now just preaching to impress you I'm giving you prophetic utterances here these things are going to happen get ready that's why the message of Elijah is to make us ready to prepare us for the coming of the Lord and so he says here the moment jeel had you know the state behind her she now began to force her religion on everybody she now kill the priests and the prophets of God and this Jezebel is here again in our generation this religious spirit Jezebel wrong Church wrong de religion which is going to form a a worldwide wrong church one worldwide religion and everyone will be listen will right now is just forming but the moment Rome has political power after all the worlders United they will have to enforce their religious systems on everyone the Bible talks about the mark of the beast and the Bible says you know if you don't have that Mark on your forehead or on your right hand you won't be allowed to sell or to buy you won't be allowed unless if you have the mark but let me tell you we have been told by the prophet of Mali 4 how are they going to receive that Mark they going to receive the mark of on the on the forehead by wrong doctrines by accepting wrong teachings like infant baptism accepting women preachers in their churches you know and and and the you know the this denominational spirits that is sweeping all over the world by accepting those spirits and doctrines which are just traditions of men not in the Bible doctrines like penitence doctrines like you know you know doctrines like you know all those teachings the worship of of a woman you know replacing Faith with the Lord and a whole combination of things by accepting those wrong teachings the Trinity by accepting those doctrines teachings which are not in the Bible by accepting those wrong teachings They will receive the mark of the beast in their forehead by accepting to believe those things and if you are hearing me and you have already accepted them you still have a chance the Bible says the only chance is come out of her my people be not partakers of our sin come out of her be ye separate that is the only hope the time is coming when there will be no hope anymore and then by the right hand that is by the fellowship fellowshipping with those that don't believe the right doctrines how is that Fellowship going to be by accepting to come under one Union with them okay we don't believe the same thing but let us be brothers and then you shake hands and then you make an organization CC of churches and we are all under that being under that even if you don't believe what they believe you have received the mark of the beast by your by by your right hand of Fellowship thank God for the end time message thank God for the Elijah in the end time because now we know and we came out of that nonsense Hallelujah we are being restored back again to the foundations of the world praise God God and wait for Jezebel to receive that power behind her she began persecuting and killing the Propet but where was Elijah Elijah never went out that Union Elijah never believed what Jezebel said elah refused to go under that elah was not was opposing all those other prophets one man versus all the other let me tell you one man in the hands of God will defeat all the demons in Hell thank God for the Elijah in our time because one man has opposed all the religious denomination of Doctrine and called him all sorts of Nam but that has helped the bride in our so it is so bad that Elijah the messenger of to his day thought he was the only one left but God had 7,000 more need to oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah even if God used Elijah in that generation God had more 7,000 more 7,000 in every nation I believe I am among them Hallelujah who will not bow and God of Jezebel and right now out there among among this those denominations of Baptist Methodist there are some that will come out and come back to God this message let me declare this to you now this message is going to call them from every denomination on Earth from Baptist they will come out from methodists will come out from larians Catholics from angc from Muslims from everywhere they will come out from Adventist they will come out what is this this is not another religion we have not been called from our religion to our religion we are being called from a religion to Jesus Christ we are non denominational we are believers of the message of elah in theend we have accepted the end time message which has turned our hearts back again to the original Faith praise God I want you to know I am not and brother bam here is saying something I want you to know I am not now and never have ever been against the [Music] people it is the denomination when we say Catholicism we don't mean the people there when we say Baptist we don't mean the people there we mean the systems that are lying to the people the bride will come out of them it is the denomination the systems of organization that I am against I have to be against it for God hats it so you see the bride where is the bride going to come from the bride is going to be raptured out of all those denominations out of theel out of the Miracle Center the bride is going to come out of everywhere but God is not the author of confusion he doesn't come when they are there he comes he he removes them first he prepares them he fills them with the Holy Ghost and he sets them and makes them ready and then off they go to the Rapture when he comes that's what this message is all about it's a preparation message hallelujah we're being prepared for the coming of the Lord Jezebel became the power that controlled the king she controlled the king but you see there was a time and that was the time that was appropriate for God to send Elijah and Elijah came on the scene to restore back the truth our Jezebel religion is already here trying to control the king to control the world to control the peop of the world but this is the time that God should send Elijah this is the time that Elijah should come to restore us amen while I finish let us read First Kings 17:17 and it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman the Mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him okay because of time let me read it only in English and she said unto Elijah what have I to do with thee Oh thou man of God at Thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance and to slay my son and he said unto her give me thy son and he took him out of her bossom and carried him up into a loft where he aboard and laid him upon his own bed and he cried unto the Lord and said oh Lord my God hast thou also brought evil upon the Widow with whom i s John by slaying his son her son and uh and he stretched himself upon the child three times and Cried unto the Lord and said oh Lord my God I pray thee let this childish Soul come into him again and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived he was restored amen and Elijah took the child and brought him down out of the chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and Elijah said see thy son liveth and the woman said unto Elijah now by this I know that thou art a man of God and that the word of the Lord is in thy mou that is in thy mouth is truth this is the god of Elijah amen hallelujah you know when this child died you know you need to understand this miracle was repeated under Elijah's Ministry in The Next Step I'll be able to show you how the ministry of Elijah actually is in continuation even after Elijah was taken continued with elishah and from elishah it continued on to John the Baptist and from John the Baptist it continues on to William Bram from William Bram it continues on to another man who goes to Israel and that's how the ministry of Elijah ends so now we will talk about that later but now I want you to look at the beginning of it here when Elijah came when he came to this woman only having a little thing for her to die but you know uh you know you know how what God did then and then this this man of God was um just around when the the woman come comes and says you see the child gets sick and then dies there was no breath in him and said unto Elijah what do I have to do with you now listen when the ministry of Elijah comes it doesn't matter the situation this child died after the woman had received Elijah and the child died let me ask you a question why why did God allow it God allowed it so that this can happen and the woman said to Elijah now by this I know that thou a man of God and the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth God allows bad situations to come to us so that we we can recognize the ministry he has sent to us in our time we have if we have the ministry of Elijah then the god of Elijah must do the same thing he did at this time if you are in a bad condition in your life you must be able to go to the god of el and tell him if you are of God here is my situation here is my problem if you are the same God of el tell me what should I do don't fear to challenge God challenge God over any condition Hallelujah if you meet the same conditions that this woman made she accepted the word but she needed Vindication of that word in her life the message is Vindicated elah was Vindicated by God but this woman needed that Vindication in her personal life when the god of Elijah came down Hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah he took that child he said what your child is dead give me the child Hallelujah he went right back to God again and he said God what about this situation and then God revealed to him what to do he stretched himself on the child three times justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost when Elijah comes he comes with a full package his message Hallelujah justifies those need to justifi he sanctifies you when you need to be Sanctified amen amen if you believe it with all your heart it's the best for you to receive the B of the Holy Ghost that's why the proof that you have the Holy Ghost is by receiving the message of Elijah hey that is the proof by receiving the word of your day it is the proof you have the Holy Ghost so now listen to me amen three things stretched on himself on the child by the by the end of that I mean where there was death life sprung up where there was sadness Joy came up where there was loss there was propect let me tell you we serve the same God of Elijah Hallelujah take it out from the word and put it in your own life what is your situation like is there death that same God of Elijah should restore should restore let me tell you if we have received the ministry of Elijah it is the minist of restoration which we must begin believing for restoration in our own individual lives not even in the Generation Now anymore but in my own personal life if your prayer life is dead you need to go to that God of Life say here is my life he will restore he will restore the fire he will restore the Ze he will restore the prayer life he will restore there must be restoration if you have
