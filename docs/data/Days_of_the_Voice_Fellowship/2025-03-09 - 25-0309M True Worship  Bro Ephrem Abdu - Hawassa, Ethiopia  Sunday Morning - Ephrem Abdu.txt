Jesus Christ amen your neighbor tell them welcome amen make sure everyone is greeted uh we are certainly thankful to the Lord for yet another opportunity to be in his house um um a few are missing out this morning about three or four that that are traveling maybe uh our recent couple sister Marl and brother Alan they made mention to me that they went to evening light bright Tabernacle to you know appreciate them for standing so perhaps they join us later but for those of you who have been able to make it this morning it's a blessing come and share together amen and uh I'm I'm happy to um also see Sister Sarah uh who is actually the mother to our brother EP and God bless you so much for coming to fellowship with us this morning uh so uh this morning we have brother ephra going to preach to us uh those of you who did not come here on Wednesday you missed out a lot uh there are a few preachers that preach and I get excited but I really was excited on on Wednesday so I just need a little more he has quite interesting Ministry he has a good grip on the word and I'm sure that his ministry will be a blessing to all of us you know there are some people who would um who would categorize ministers on the basis of their age I happen not to be among them because I understand according to the preaching of the message brother bam when he talks even about an elder says someone who is seasoned in the word and talking about spiritual maturity he's not talking about um age wise so God has always called young men and then from being young of course they grow and they grow old but it is one thing to have someone who has a gift and pre and and can preach at someone but it's another for someone to have um uh you know a Ministry and then and then focus and put their entire life to the service of the Lord the word and know what they're talking about when I came to this message that's exactly what I did started the message start everywhere I go I don't have to preach and then I say oh I'm sorry I was wrong here I should know what I'm talking about and God has been with us over the years and I believe that um uh I see brother ephra taking that trend is one of the uh few uh Brothers in Ethiopia after receiving the message that he really took it serious and he started he's been studying this message like listening to it stud and um asking questions where necessary and also ministering and going traveling with all his and when I came back from Ethiopia gave you the testimony for those who did not know this is the pastor who was hosting us there and we had a very good [Music] meetings it had a great impact on on the local people there so he has a lot of work on his shoulders a big burden and um we should really remember him and his wife in prayer that God will give them the grace that they need to fulfill the ministry amen amen so this afternoon I'll be going to brother Fred brother Fred is not here and brother uh his brother brother Jo as you know brother Fred graduated recently and so he invited us to go um and and and preach to his people to his family they Gathering all the family members father mother of course they having like a ceremony like Thanksgiving or something like that gradation Thanksgiving ceremony so um and then he told me Pastor I'm going to give you 1 hour said 1 hour that's even more than we need on such a so his desire is that we go and preach this message to I believe it's a no thing I know there are a few more who are going to graduate here I think that's a very good Trend to follow invite us let us come and you know expose your friends your family this precious message GI give so we will be there this afternoon so remember us in prayers and also brother Daniel will be preaching in this evening so you remember him in prayers I'll be traveling I think with brother um s and a few other brothers so just remember us in prayer so shall we stand on our feet welcome the minister those who are visiting with us this morning you welcome and uh just be expectant that the Lord will be able to minister is it amen amen ask your neighbor you ready for the word so let us welcome Pastor ifraim abdd from message of the Cross Tabernacle ethiop amen I think we just invite you right away amen hallelujah hallelujah how many you are happy today hallelujah hallelujah we are not happy because of our family or our bu maybe we have few surprises are happy that the Lord with us today Hallelujah and I have a news to tell you if you had made it this far if you had made this far the Lord will take you on the end of the journe amen hallelujah amen yesterday I as I was planning to study I was having a lot in my mind and quickly an inspiration came where Peter and Silas was in a very bad situation they did a lot for the work of God they served him with all of their but there come a situation where they cannot fulfill their Duty both of both of their hands both of their legs tied up they could not move they could not clap but one Revelation came to them in this situation where we cannot preach where there is no one to hear us let us worship our Lord hallelujah hallelujah and when they Worship the Lord unexpected power came to release them from their situation hallelujah amen and the power will come today to release us from our problem to release us from our burden hallelujah hallelujah so you're not alone hallelujah hallelujah you're not alone so let us open our scripture Revelation chapter 5 the book we love to read from verse it says like this and when he had taken the book and the four pieces and the four 12 Elders fell down before the lamp having every one of them HS and golden vales full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sang a new song saying thou are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and the tongue and the people and the nation and they has made us unto us go God's Kings and Priests and we shall reign on Earth amen God bless you you hallelujah hallelujah today I want to talk about a true worship I will say it again a true worship and you see in the Bible whenever we approach to read it we need Revelation and when you see the prophet approaching the church book The First Foundation he put on was Revelation by the spirit Hallelujah and last time as we said Revelation is not your opinion and the book in Revelation chapter 5 was closed and in Revelation chapter 10 the book was open the book was not open because we said it's open the book was not open because we believe the message the book was not open because we were baptized the book was open because we have a personal revelation by Jesus Christ Hallelujah and that's why very important to have Revelation you see in Genesis we see Abel and K you see K had to put a lot of work tried to to prove his belief K had to go to the garden and look for a beautiful things to serve the Lord you see Ken was not a bad person matter of fact the prophet says he was a Believer Kan was a True Believer but you see the difference that he had with AB pleased God by faith and that Faith brought him Revelation hallelujah hallelujah so it allowed God to identify himself in his [Applause] sacrifice Hallelujah so in Ephesians 1 verse 18 it says the eyes of your understanding being en that he may know what is the hope of his calling I pray today that our understanding eyes will be open Hallelujah because K Tau he had sufficient Faith you see remember heard the same voice Abel heard every evening God was coming to every every evening Kan was attending the service he Tau the sensation and the happiness will take him far he thought hearing God's voice only will take him far it only took him somehow somewhere was unable to finish his journey so we need to have more than a voice more than sensation we need to have more than happiness that is a revelation Hallelujah Revelation is more than going to church Revelation is more than being happy Revelation is more than receiving a prophecy because Revelation is a personal reunion between you and God Alone Hallelujah so we need Revelation hallelujah hallelujah so that is where the church was buil on Revelation hallelujah hallelujah and when we read the scripture the prophet told us in Revelation chapter 5 6168 paragraph 207 it says like this now let me just read the rest this so I can get you right quickly now and when he had taken the book and the four bces and the 20 and the four Elders fell down before the lamp uh having every one of them HS and golden vials full of it says now this is the time when everything must be worshiped I'll repeat again it says now this is a time when everything must be worship it says everything must be woried how appropriate now I don't want let us miss this now listen close when all the mysteries of the church age was finished when all the mystery of Plan of Redemption and them Seven Seals were opened right immediately after this now it is time for all everything in heaven and everything on Earth to worship God now watch what takes place listen at just uh this minute and they sang a new song saying thou are worthy the prophet is telling us after the mystery is finished we will see a lot of worship matter of fact he said this is an age of worship until you cannot differentiate between what is a true worship and the false worship because the age we live in whether they are denomination whether they are nomination it is a season of worship everything worship God so it will be very hard to differentiate where is the true worship because here we have our brothers they are worshiping also here we have brothers also worship so we will have a lot of worship everywhere and each of them will call the name of God it is very hard to differen which one is a true worship and which one is a false worship because the season we are living in everyone somehow calls God that's why in John chapter 4 verse 23 it says but the hour comes and now is when a true worshiper shall worship the father in the spirit and truth it didn't say for a true preacher it didn't say the how comes for a true preacher it say the hour comes for a good leader for a true worshiper and this true worshiper shall worship the father in spirit and truth hallelujah hallelujah so when we are talking about worship there was there was a time where God was not good because the term God means an object of so for God desired so much to be worshiped that he has an tribute to be [Music] woried he had to create an angels so when he's worshiped now we can call him God the main reason that we are put here on Earth is to worship God hallelujah hallelujah because God wants has a desire to be God he created Adam so he can be a he can be a father and God at the same time Hallelujah so there was a time that Adam was worshiping God Adam had a perfect worship Adam had a spotl worship every day Adam worshiped God and there was a devil watching this worship the greatest battle ever fought in heaven was because the devil also wanted to be worshiped his desire was want to be like God he wants to receive worship so he Dees Angel not in Earth but in heaven to follow the devil and he deceive them and to fight God on on heaven what was the main point God wanted to be worshiped also the devil wants to be worship so the greatest battle ever fought on heaven was a worship God wanted a worship also the devil wanted a worship so when we are looking the church age book we are looking the greatest battle fought on Earth the greatest battle ever fought in heaven God throw the devil down on us but his intention was never changed he has the same intention he had in heaven so still now he's looking for people to worship him not in the name of the devil but the name of God he has a desire to pick go God but today I Take God in every false worship there are few godal people that will worship him no matter what no matter the situation happen they will call up his name they will say you are my God they will say you are my creator they will say you are my father they will say no matter what happen I will call your name I am called by your name so I'll call your name hallelujah hallelujah what is that it is a gene of God in you Hallelujah Desiring to seek God on us hallelujah so when we are looking on the church's book we see the seed was planted right in the Eden Garden the tree of life and the tree of knowledge and so these two seeds they always grow side by side and they are both religious spirits and they want they are you always find them in the church so one have a true Spirit to worship and has a false spirit so when we are looking the churches book a battle between right and wrong it is a fight between right and wrong it is a fight between true worship and false worship it is a fight between True Word of God and false of word of God hallelujah hallelujah but there time AG go time where in the Bible it tells us God will restore our worship God will restore our worship Hallelujah because we never see God leave the people alone we will never see that the people that are called by his name they might go away from him a little bit but he will still reach out to them because he is the father to them Hallelujah so in Acts chapter 15 it speaks like this acts chap 15 verse 13 it says and after they had held their peace James answered saying men and Brethren heart broken unto me Simon had declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles to take out that same people for his name and to this agree the word of the Prophet as it was written after this I will return and will build again the Tabernacle of David which is fallen down and I will build again the runes thereof and I will set it up amen you see the Pharisees came to the Gentiles and they told them to be to obey the law of Moses by making them circumcised they try to they tried to show them the custom of Jewish telling the Gentile this is how we worship God this is a true way of worshiping God and here we see that the Tabernacle of David was promised to be restored when we talk about the Tabernacle of Moses God told to build the Tabernacle on the mount called Gideon and they went on the Wilderness and they built that Tabernacle and this Tabernacle have three coachs and there is a first C there is a second and there is a third cat and only a selected priest can enter to the holies of holies where the presence of God is and offer a true sacrifice he is only person who can worship God by them him and him alone the rest of the Believers have to stand behind the veil and that is how they worship God so they worship God that was hidden they worship God that was veiled Hallelujah it was only the high priest who can go to the second who can go to the iners of and it is only him who can sacrifice a true worship the rest they stay outside and they just watch what the high priest hallelujah hallelujah so that was a type of worship in the days of Moses theab that they have they have all the praise altar they have the sacrifice altar they have the musicians they have the elders but when they are worshiping they worship a veiled God he was never revealed to them it was only for the high priest that can worship God for them they had a limit Hallelujah that's why Paul was saying how he could wish he had this day opportunity time opportunity all the Mysteries is revealed Hallelujah Daniel wanted to see this day Paul wanted to see this day brother Bram wanted to see because it was a precious day for us where all the mystery was open and we can preach an open book by revelation of the word hallelujah but for them when they worship God it was a closed book because the book was sealed with seven and no one was worthy to open the book so the opportunities they have was to send a high priest and that high priest will worship behalf of them they have all the ARs they have chirs for them they have guitars here they have keyboards behind but all they worship they are doing was without Revelation because they were didn't have the opportunity that we had today they didn't have the opportunity we have today that's why the prophet said we are living in the Golden Age we are living in a super age where the bride has an opportunity to create a word for her Hallelujah why everything was revealed when God is revealed meaning you are also being revealed your identity is also being revealed your work is also being revealed Hallelujah we have an open book today Hallelujah so when we come to the days of Moses the worship they have was outside of the court now let us open uh First Chronicles verse are enjoying this far I'm happy that I'm here today 1 Chronicles chapter 15 verse one it like and David made him a house in the city of David and prepared a place for the Ark of God and Pitch it all a tent amen now David wanted to bring the ark back to Jerusalem and when when we see David he is a king he is a priest and he was a prophet now in the Old Testament it is impossible for one person to be both Prophet a priest and a king but God was somehow putting David there to type the bride the future coming Bri where she is a king and a priest Hallelujah when we see the Tabernacle of David it doesn't have three courts there is no first Court there is no Second Court it only had one Court and remember only the king and priest can enter in that Court David being a king and a priest didn't send anyone to go to the Tabernacle he went by himself to face God hallelujah he didn't need any permission to enter the Earth because God was typing David that this is how the future bride will be she is a king and a priest that is doming on the earth Hallelujah so when David Goes To Worship he goes alone to worship God he didn't need to advise anybody about he can have the access to worship God hallelujah hallelujah what is that typing it is God talking face to face to you coming in you the hope of glory in you that you are the king and the priest and you can worship God by yourself hallelujah amen we thank God because worshiping is not just singing worshiping is not having a good vocal worshiping is 24 hours living for God hallelujah you don't say I worship God for for 30 minutes a worship is an experience of God Liv you living in you amen so when you are going to work you're worshiping God when you're going to school you're worshiping God when you're going to the kitchen you're worshiping God whatever you do you do it for the glory of God hallelujah hallelujah that is what separates you from the other people you do everything to glorify God hallelujah amen you are special people called by his name Hallelujah so uh in uh Revelation 510 he had made us King and priest and we shall r on Earth hallelujah amen here on Earth he has made her King and priest what does that mean you go straight to the Hol of H you go straight to the Shak Glory you go straight to meet God hallelujah amen you are special people hallelujah hallelujah First Chronicles Hallelujah hallelu huah 16 from verse one so they brought the Ark of God and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitch for it and they offered a in sacrifice and peace offering before [Music] God and when David had made an end of offering and burning sacrifice and peace offering he blessed the people in the name of the Lord and he has dealt to everyone of Israel both men and woman to everyone a loaf of bread and a good piece of Flesh and a flagon of wine and he appointed certain of L es to minister before the Ark of the Lord and to record and thank and praise the Lord of God of Israel you know it was only the high priest who could Bless the people you know it was only the high priest who can sacrifice a good but here David ising being a king and a priest he sacrifice and burning sacrifice and therefore he blessed the people hallelujah that was a type of an open book Hallelujah there is time that the book is going to be opened where we don't need another Prophet where we don't need another Revelation where we have this Revelation that this is an open book and then you can offer a Sacrifice by yourself that's why salvation is an individual of father will not be asked your mother will not be asked it is upon you you and you alone Hallelujah your father could be a preacher your mother could be a good prayer but that doesn't have nothing to do with you you are there alone David was there alone as a king and a priest typing the bride that is coming typing an open book that is coming when you have the Revelation you become the word you manifest the word Hallelujah that's why you don't need someone to H his hands on you you don't need someone to prophesy over you don't need someone to pay and to pay money and pray for you God has given you an open book Hallelujah I get confused sometimes when people speak so much of the Seven Seals [Applause] they dwell so much on the horses the white hor the black hor but the Seven Seals is the coming of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah what does that mean God is coming and he's putting on a flesh Hallelujah he's manifesting his will on Earth Hallelujah that is the coming of the world r word coming and manifesting in you Hallelujah so that's why they could say it's opening of the horse and everything for me I will say it is these Seven Seals is opening myself it is telling me my mystress it is telling me what I can do it is telling me where I came from it is telling me where I am going Hallelujah the Seven Seals it is a book that is revealing you it is telling who you are is telling your identity hallelujah amen so when we talk so much of the Rapture it is not that we we we fly on the air and someone with a big hair will come and take us for us will be crying be happy no the prophet says the Rapture is in you that means you don't expect another Rapture because the Rapture is in you and Rapture is a process Hallelujah Noah had only faith of saving his people that is the limit that he has his faith that is the faith he has to save the people that is the ability that Noah has but Enoch took over and it says I'm not saving my people only I will get rapture with him Hallelujah this message believe it's not just giving us faith is giving you rapturing Faith making you a rapturing material and that's why you eat a different food you eat a different food that makes you rapturing material Hallelujah so Noah had a faith of salvation but had a phase of rapturing faith and this message is building your faith Hallelujah I believe that I believe that hallelujah amen Rapture is taking over now hallelujah amen so we don't expect Rapture somewhere we expect Rapture in us hallelujah amen amen amen so uh we are the spiritual priest in First Peter 2 ver9 it says ye are a chosen generation amen I will say you are a chosen generation you had an opportunity that Moses didn't have you had opportunity Paul didn't have you have opportunity brother Bram Hallelujah you have opportunity this is a scripture for you and this scripture is fulfilled in your day you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a pecular people hallelujah amen do you know Levites when we book of the first Chronicles David was talking about Levites do you know Levites have to be born in a certain way someone cannot wake up from bed today I am a l today I want to go to a Lev school they will not accept you you know the levit has to be born in a certain way that's why even the bride has to be born in a certain way she's born in a certain way she came to the message in a certain way no one told her to come to the message no Bishop convinced her to come to the message because when she was born there is a certain gen in her that will accept the word hallelujah that's why when we go out and preach We Don't Preach to convince the people we don't preach to debate the Bible we preach to reveal the word for them Hallelujah because we know the bride is born in a certain way and do you know Lis also live a certain way they live a separated life they have a separated life you don't see them everywhere they eat a special food they live a certain way and the briide live a certain way that's why the scripture say you are a royal priesthood you are a chosen generation you are a holy nation you are a popular Nation you are special people hallelujah so Levites know they are different people they don't join groups anywhere Amen to be a lite you don't join a levite you have to have from your n a blood of Levites if you don't have that Lage you are not considered to be Levites amen that's why you are message people not because someone has conv but you know your father already has made your mother your father has made you a certain way to believe the message Hallelujah that's why you could preach for an hour and some people would not understand it but there are some people who could catch it catch that Revelation and they will say this scripture is about me this scripture is not for anyone this scripture is for me why you are a certain people you came from a specific nation and this Earth is not your home hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah knowing this will enable us to worship a true God enable us to separate from a false worship hallelujah amen aren't you happy this is revealed to you for many they are struggling to read it for many they are hitting the why is this not revealed to me but for you it is revealed not because you have power not because you have energy not because you are smart because you are meant to believe hallelujah hallelujah so in the days of Moses there was a certain way of worship in the days of David there was a certain way of that's why the denominational people stuck so much there and they miss out the true worship today you see there is a difference between when the Pharisees CED Moses and when Jesus quoted Moses when the Pharisees was cting Moses was referring to them as a history but when Jesus was cting the the Moses it was telling them that that scripture is fulfilling this day Hallelujah but the denominational people tend to stay much on the history tend to stay much on the MS Hallelujah the God we worship is a dispensation of God hallelujah so there is a time where Moses worship was a true worship amen there is a time where David worship was a true worship but God say I cannot access people like that I cannot be here and them be here I have to be one in them I have to face to face them I have to be in them Hallelujah a true worship is in you a true worship is in you Hallelujah you don't find a true worship in the church you don't find a true worship in a se you find a true worship in you because the Seven Seals is not ringing a pastor is not revealing the prophet is not revealing a certain Church SE is a revelation of you Hallelujah and I'm here to tell you through worship shall dwell in you Hallelujah that's why Paul and they said in this situation there is no way we shall not worship my hand could be tied my leg could be tight I may not jump but I know one thing I can worship God I can call up his name I can sing God I can glorify God hallelujah am so you can worship God you can glorify Hallelujah I thank God so the Tabernacle that we see identifies the true worship in every age you see in the m in the message we see the church AG types the type of the Wilderness Hallelujah and the David Tabernacle it types the Bri the M age it was typing the church age they worshiping the Wilderness how they Worship in the hard in the days of David was typing the bride Worship in the days of Solomon type of a millenum rent so it is very important for you to identify where you belong do you belong in the churches for me I don't belong in the church for me I belong in the brid Hallelujah this is where I am I have moved from all this worship to David's worship I don't have to have three courts to worship I go straight to the holy of H I can access the spirit directly Hallelujah am and the spirit is given to you now you can worship God now you can see God hallelujah amen that's why God Moses asked Moses asked I want to see your face God told him you cannot see my face but I'll show you my back Hallelujah today today his face has been Hallelujah you could see his face Hallelujah am that's why I love the court it says you are a priesthood Nation you are separated people hallelujah amen amen I thank God for that that this message is not dwelling so much on the history it dwells so much on who you are so now it is your choice to identify your true worship in the ages that so when they when the denominational people when they worship you don't blame them you just tell them how Gods operate in a dispensational way Hallelujah I thank God for this message it will make you who you are it will give you your identic hallelujah amen so in this deceitful worship age now you could see now you could see worship Hallelujah not because of me because the message has revealed Hallelujah many people are looking when they want to meet God always this person comes in the midst he will tell them pay this amount for you your sin is very heavy so you need to pay heavy money and our people are laboring in that it is not lack of knowledge is lack of Revelation so it is upon you to the people out of her out of thein Hallelujah this is the spirit of denominationalism it will deceive you which age you are living in so you will just appear somewhere with someone telling you to do things and you end up following that man but because God loves you he has come with a message today he saying a true worship is this way true worship is this way hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah in Revelation 21 it says I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I saw a holy city a New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven preparing as a Bride adors for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven behold the Tabernacle of God is within men he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with people hallelujah amen now the Tabernacle is not in the days of Moses Tabernacle is not in the days of David Tabernacle is now in you a true worship is revealed in you where could people see a true worship see Worship in you why the Seven Seals has come to reveal God on Earth you are representing God on when they touch you they are touching God when they blame you they are blaming God hallelujah so you are a special people and in you is a true worship true worship it is a continuation of Revelation in you Hallelujah am I thank God for this message for the Tabernacle of God is within a man amen so there is a building going on there's a building going on that is a building of character we are all being built right now for the character Hallelujah am there is a building going on there is a maturity that is needed from us there is a maturity that is needed from us to reveal God in our AG Hallelujah and this building is the body of Jesus Christ Hallelujah am not Jesus Christ of 200 years ago but Jesus Christ of now Hallelujah there is a building going on Hallelujah that building is the Lord Jesus Christ and that church is built on Revelation and the Revelation is not a revelation of a man a revelation by the spirit hallelujah amen the prophet says I feel religious okay I'm not feeling religious hallelujah amen so in Acts chapter 15 it was telling us there shall be a restoration of the Tabernacle and that Tabernacle is being built now the building is going on and the revealed word is taking on flesh and that building is a building of character we cannot train without character I cannot rain without character there is a building going on that building is the Lord Jesus Christ revealing in you hallelujah amen did you get it amen the Tabernacle is being built where it is a spiritual Tabernacle is being built on you and the church is build on Revelation and that's why we said Revelation is important I thank God for you have the revation because you have a special I God gave you that can we stand up hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah Heavenly Father we came

any serpent there to his at you and bite you with his poison Venom this looks like the future indeed it is the future but we have a forest of it now because the Bible say that them that believe they shall trade on Serpent and it shall not hurt them in this life on this side of Jordan we are in Heavenly places there is not any serent there to he a d and bite you he says won it be wonderful there will be none of the none of that in the new Earth there will be no grave none of them there man and God Has Come Together bride and and bridegroom heavens and earth has embraced each other God has come down to dwell among man his Tabernacle is with them that is coming but I want to say it is here also amen man and God Has Come Together there will be no more sin no more sorrow to you if Christ has come to you and you and Christ has embraced each other to you no more sin now not in the future now no more now not in the future now whatever is coming is already here amen there will be no more sin the Bible says they that are born of God cannot no more sin no more sorrow never will there be a tear drop off of a mother's cheek over her baby it won't be mother you want have to cry for your baby anymore when you get over there but I can say even now amen it won't be on that new ground no it's redeemed it belongs to him and for his that was redeemed out of it let me tell you friends we are redeemed even now we are the redeemed we are the two worshippers amen amen and he says and look you you are a part of that ground and when he redeemed you he redeemed the Earth with the same thing and you are together again oh how much pler can it be you have to be redeemed because you are a part of it if you are not redeemed yet you have to be redeemed and if the blood didn't drop on you he's talking about the blood of Jesus you are not redeemed yet you are not yet called then he cleanses it that's the same thing he does in the fire even the blood dropped it is yet got to be cleansed by fire for a dwelling place for God but I want to say God his blood has dropped on me God already took his aboard potentially the kingdom of God is in the earth now let us not look for the kingdom of God the of God is here where the Tabernacle of God dwells in men the kingdom of God is in the earth now in the hearts of his Saints oh you ought to shout Amen to it is his attributes that he begin in the beginning now his attributes is redeemed what is he waiting to red the Earth to set his attributes in it to fulfill exactly his predestinated [Music] plan can you say amen that's why we don't preach to convince anyone we preach only to reveal you the word reveals Who You Are Levites are not made they are born we are royalty we are priests offering spiritual sacrifices we are revealed in this hour the only thing that is remaining is redeem the Earth but we are redeemed I am redeemed if you redeemed just say I am redeemed in that in that land of the redeemed in that place no Graves no tear no more Bloodshed no teardrops no no more walls no more clouds of winter it won lay no more on it sun will will be there there will be no desert I'm talking about the Millennium but everything that we have talked about we potentially the the receivers of right now let us pray Lord there's a lot more we can talk about this we are looking forward to that time when we are going to be in that place [Music] but even now Lord we can sing a new song because we are the redeemed of the lord we know who we are now by the opening of the SE it has revealed who we are it has revealed that we are not among those that are getting lost in Satan's Aiden but we are among those of the redeemed we are the redeemed we are rejoicing in our hearts not because we feel it but because it is revealed us because we know that none of your own can be lostone of father in a congregation like this I know there might be someone Lord that has had questions in their heart but trouble Lord through but may you impress it upon their hearts I pray for them to know that they cannot be lost and that they have no choice but to respond to the revealed word of their for that se they must respond to that word no matter where they are no matter who they are you will find them you will call them you will establish them in the present truth and Lord we are among those that you have called and we so much appreciate you Lord and since we came in this place we realize we are redeemed and we have a new to sing a new song to sing nothing of this world can make us worry or make us go away of your grace and nothing of this world can satisfy it's only in you we are safe we are the true worshippers that would worship you in spirit and in that woman at the she receed that Revelation that it was not at a certain Mountain certain set of doctrines and teachs it was the person of Christ and she worship truly and Lord here we are we are the true worshipers not by might or by strength but by your grace we are grateful to the servant of God bless him I pray anoint him give him more understanding and revelation of your whenever he stands you will be a blessing to your people I thank you for these people Lord that have come to in this place let your blessings rest upon them Father and Grant every need in their hearts Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated amen God bless you Sister is Brother John here sister Esther is Brother John here no okay the the last Sunday Sunday U this is just a testimony before you go um sister Esther you were not around you were sick then I you give the testimony we thank God for your healing amen and so um sister Esther met somebody gentle and this man was um um Pentecost is a Pentecostal there and one of the churches in m and so um I think he had gone at shop to buy certain things and and then sister Esther started evangelizing inv and then invited him to church also told him about the message the leadership and um also I think he added him on a Channel of a certain a brother who has a WhatsApp Channel where they usually share message so this man was always listening to these things and uh one time of course they lost when he left they left they were not in touch and then she went um so he went back to his church and now after a while of listening to the messages ah he started talking about it for get to his pastors get to the people in the church so the pastor called him to order he said this we don't believe this stop spreading it around and they they really took a problem with him and uh you know you know he felt out of place but these things are the scripture the Bible we talk about women preachers it is in the Bible you talk about baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it is in the Bible so why are you getting offended no no no it's not the do of our church and you should not preach these things and uh so the brother F out of place I remember who connected me to these things by the way it was that woman called so he looked he told me I looked for her number and I finally found it and then last Sunday she called him he called her and told her I'd like to go to your church with you this morning she said ah sorry I'm sick I'm at home I'm not this Sunday no but you direct me I'll go so sister called me in the morning gave me the contact and we directed him so he came and um he he said he thoroughly enjoyed the and uh I found him okay I was meeting a few people so for almost 30 minutes the man waited and the whole time he was with Brother Martin and he was telling him this testimonies was excited and um and I found him still waiting he said I want I waited to tell you this testimony now I have you even my entire family I want them I want to bring them but I could not come without knowing the place first I wanted to come and see the place and hear what you preaching then I can also bring my entire family so imagine so sister Esther we have to follow up that leadership you know I tell you what friends you all are evangelists you know God has his seed somewhere and his seed can never be lost it's not the trying and preaching and cutting you know that's why this message is not a Hellfire message the message we are preaching is not a Hellfire message let me emphasize that again the end time message is not a Hellfire message I know I had I had in one of the sermons of uh you know what is his name he preached and said repent or go to hell that's okay it belongs to some people we preach it but not to beli you get a point let me clarify to the Believers I don't even need to threaten you with hell hell is not your portion there's not no scripture in the Bible that says you are going to hell okay if you are here because you are fearing to go to hell you are in the wrong place the people we are preaching to we are not saving them from hell what we are doing I'll tell you what we are doing we are preaching a message that is reminding them who they are now when they realize who they are they begin to even shed off a few things that they realize they don't need any because they have found out who they truly are a prince is not a prince because you've chosen them to be a prince is that amen a prince is a prince by birth a prince before he is born is a prince but say if a prince is born and then he's taken into slavery if he knows he's a prince he will continue behaving as well but if he does not know and he's told you mean I'm a prince from that day you will stop dressing like the other he will stop behaving like because he has realized who he is we were born in all these denominations some of you thought you were catholic others thought you were angc others thought you P but then you had the ego scream mother ego screaming calling out your name and then you're like ah that voice is familiar and now the prophet says you know if the bride receives the revelation of who she truly is she will not be defeated she will be an invisible if she knows who she is and who she stands for so every preaching we come here to do is to help you to understand who you are and who what you stand for that's what it's all about and I'm so glad that every time I sit under the preaching of the word I realize more about the revelation of Jesus Christ brings you the revelation of yourself because you are a part of the leg is a part of me so the leg is me you are a part of Christ so you are him amen that's why the Bible calls you the salt of the earth the Bible calls you you you the light of the world but Jesus is the light of the world but you are the light of the world you are the Epistles written Epistles read of all men so you are the word of God Jesus is the word of God so whatever he is you are amen so whenever you that's why we by the way we should feed on the word we should read the messages we should we should read the Bible and we should pray because these things will help us to understand who we are so the summon this morning has been one of our kind to remind us who we are we are true worshipers amen I'm a true worshiper so as we dismiss I'd like to encourage you to some of you have relaxed in prayer I believe that a Believer should always be communing with God we should always be in prayer know Jesus do you know that Jesus was a man of prayer you're not answering me that's the truth he was always was a man of prayer God so we had a prayer group um I don't know what's happening with them days but I pray that God gives you a Revival because without prayer a church which has no prayer will go nowhere and if you want to join that prayer group please see these brothers Brothers see Brother Martin and brother Dan or Jo sisters you can see I think it is Sister Ruth I Ruth and those of you others who I think Sister Mary is there and then let them put you on that group the ones who don't want to pray talk to them to be removed and then the ones who want so that the fire can continue see I believe prayer is a burden which you receive from the Lord and some have it others don't but the ones who do have it you should always keep the fire going as much as I believe each of us must be at our place of prayer each of us we must be men and women of us let us not relax in pray let us pray for the ministry there's a lot of needs let us pray for the ministers for the church for families and the Lord will bless you so brother ephra God bless you so much we would like to pray for him that God will bless him also he has a lot of Burden for the work in aasa many parts in Ethiopia is one of the people that really God is using there we should pray for him and we tell him God bless you and we are going to be praying for you amen God bless you all shom can you come we meet W on Wednesday at 5 6 p.m. [Music] hold to
