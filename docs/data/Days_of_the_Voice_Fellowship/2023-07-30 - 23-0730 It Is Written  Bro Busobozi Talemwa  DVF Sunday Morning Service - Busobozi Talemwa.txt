mind standing for just a few more moments amen so can I have a little more Sound by the shame if you can but and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness being 40 days tempted of the devil and in those days he did he did he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungered our yes [Music] and the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command this stone that it should that it may be made bread and Jesus answered and him saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God yes and the devil taking him up into an eye Mountain showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever I will give it and if thou thereof I would worship me all shall be thine and Jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him on thou serve [Music] and he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down from hands it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and in their hands they shall bear the up last at any time thou shall dust thy food against a stone and Jesus answering said unto him it is said Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God [Music] and when the devil had ended all the Temptation he departed from him for a season Jesus returned in the power of the of the spirit into Galilee and there went out a lame when I went out sorry a Fame of him through all the region round about the communities amen I mean you may be seated may God bless the reading of the word this morning to those of you who missed out on Sunday on one Friday we had a little sharing and we were speaking on he shall accomplish it [Music] and and today I want to speak to you on it is written why tell your neighbor it is written tell to people it is all right you told one or two it is written it is written that's just what we want to talk about this morning and just before I forget we have a meeting with the committee that is arranging the youth meetings for January [Music] right after the service and then we I also have other things I want to discuss with them about so it is written what is written Luke chapter 4 is one of the most powerful scriptures because it shows us how to overcome certain ingredient did you know that the moment you were born into this world you started a battle with Saturn we go without knowing but you know you are fighting and you want to overcome but it seems as if it is impossible for you to overcome and you are fighting you've been fighting ever since you you know you you you you came to the edge of accountability foreign [Music] is uh two laws working in me so this one is walking inside of me another one is Walking In My Flesh and both these are against one another it's a battle the battle that we are fighting we don't want to do bad but you find yourself doing bad you want to do what God says or you to please the Lord but you find yourself doing the wrong things so you are confused to come to that place whereby you cry out not to come on how will I overcome I want to be well and many people make decorations especially when the year is about to start from today you know by the time the first hour finds me I am no longer going to do this to even get books and they write the things I am making a resolution I am signing my name on this I'm no longer Furniture passes [Music] because it is not your decision to say I will not do this the Bible says not by power Hallelujah it is written this is a very good way of knowing how to overcome today I'm going to give you one clue the best one how to overcome the devil or unless you're not fighting against oh you're fighting every one of us you're fighting in your life if you're married you're fighting in your marriage you're fighting in your business you're fighting in your education you want to be the best certain things but it feels as if it is impossible the reason because people we try to do it on our own foreign and we are going to read there from verses seven um seven years and I request you to have as little movement as possible please [Music] help me if you have to um amen so we're looking at Revelation 12 foreign this was the first war to be fought God the Bible doesn't tell us when God is creating angels and the Bible tells us God created angels that you can find when you open the moment you open your Bible in Genesis chapter one The Bible says God was already God in the beginning what does it say foreign foreign [Music] does anybody know what God means what does it means object of worship that's why he says Thou shalt not have other gods before so what is a god a God is something that you Worship in African tradition we used to have you know to worship trees the big tree with big buttressed Roots people think oh that is it's a goddess and you know we go there in there and we worship and we put money and you know he she gives us blessings together and you know they go there and they claim oh it works for us when you go to India they also have their own Idols when you go to some Churches they also have their idols foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] himself alone no one worshiped him he has a fellowship with anybody or anything he was the Elohim Yari hello to have something to worship Him He created angels now this was before the beginning of Genesis 1 1. the Bible doesn't give us the account of the creation of angels but we are able to know by other scriptures that Angels were created by God and also we are able to know by other scriptures that in heaven Angels worship God every day they say holy holy those are the Angels now and so we find out the Lucifer Lucifer was one of the chief most angels in heaven if you if you want to rank him he might have been one of the maybe a four or five star general yeah and it was great as a matter of fact you might not know but Lucifer was the one leading all the music in heaven Lucifer area he was greatly blessed with a nice voice [Music] I have many angels who are even listening to me I can send them [Music] [Applause] [Applause] was sent to God foreign so don't yes we are human beings so we can we understand it in a physical way and it's all right for you to draw an image I want you to understand these were Spirits you're not human beings but they as Angels they also have their own Angelic spiritual bodies let us see what the Bible says verse seven and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels so the Bible calls Lucifer here now at Dragon when a Bible also calls him other names in verse 9 it says verse it says and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Saturn which deceiveth the whole world and he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him praise the name of the Lord oh my glory to God this should make me and my soul excited that no one can stand against the king Our God cannot be defeated he's The Undefeated champion the Bible says Lucifer was overcome and he was kicked out of heaven and all these other Angels they were kicked out of heaven so today later we no longer not Lucifer as Lucifer Lucifer Lucifer Lucifer is a beautiful name luciferina do you know what Lucifer of the morning beautiful I don't begin to give it to your children praise the name of Allah to do what Lucifer did even where we are now today don't think that to me the devil you need to go somewhere and then you go under the sea or under the waters you meet him every day the scripture that says those that God foreign [Applause] a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God the accuser of our Brethren is cast down before our God day and night and they overcome him are you hearing me now by the blood of the Lambs what is the word of your testimony it is the blood of Jesus whatever praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah this battle has been raging ever since Jesus Christ yes Crystal he's the mighty conqueror when he came down he came for a purpose [Music] oh my when Jesus came yes he came with one purpose yeah that Jesus conquered there yes Jesus conquered him yes conquer the grace let me ask you do you support Jesus foreign he conquered all the World season conquered the last [Music] he conquered the last of the flesh we conquered the last of the earth [Music] Jesus is alive today yes use these words it is written [Applause] glory to God out of what brother William Branham preached in 1959. many years ago but still relevant today he said in the Garden of Eden yeah foreign [Music] that's a scripture in the Book of Psalms says the word of God is powerful Hallelujah and the devil Charles when God gave his word to Adam he told him here is my words foreign hmm let me ask you a question the devil Satan will be so right do you think that for the devil to be a devil everything he says is wrong [Music] the devil will be so right for him to be a deceiver [Music] he will only be one person wrong 0.0.1 percent [Music] for God everything the devil said about this fruit was correct [Music] everything the devil said about what God Said was correct but the only line was you will not die yet God said you will die from that moment she gave to her husband he died no longer see what God spoke about them now dwelling on what the devil said about them in this Bible [Music] the victory that overcomes the world is not in psychology psychology it is not in education it is not in man's Wisdom it is in the word of God that is the victory let me tell you all people that have been successful in this life throughout and at the end of their life there were people who believe that people crying foreign [Music] [Music] Masters [Music] foreign yeah to all generations is all yourself [Music] today nothing yes [Music] [Music] forever come on tonight I understand because it was six years do you know who you are what is things foreign [Applause] Hallelujah [Music] and it says for my thoughts I'm not your fault they are your ways [Music] [Music] and my ghost and your thoughts welcome back [Music] [Music] oh my God not bad that goes out of my mouth your next episode together I remember when I first went up to church I fear to always say Amen I'm searching for people all the time say Amen if you want to say [Music] [Applause] you know every Church [Music] [Music]

we look at what the word says control s okay for you Christians [Applause] don't feel sorry for me to speak without the microphones okay so we'll just have to go like this I hope you people are hearing me as long as you're hearing me I'm sorry praise the name of the Lord not those of those people who decided to stay at home and not go to church now now their own life is helping them brother always says never forsake the Assembly of yourself nothing can replace coming to church the word of God shall accomplish is that the thing is everything he said about the church you know we have been collecting our land funds that we are still collecting we believe we must have our own land we believe we must construct our church [Applause] he told us his future 29. I didn't ask us to ask small uh the church something in your personal life [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] Chicago [Applause] one of these days [Applause] [Applause] [Music] oh my God that is his word [Applause] accomplish [Applause] oh my some of you may not be believing it [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah it says let me now say this now anyway [Music] another and two foreign Promises of God another end too much if you can look at it the way God wrote it [Applause] it is written thank you guys [Applause] [Music] the last of the flesh Jesus was telling him you were hungry the name is [Applause] I don't know what you understand stick with the one that moment foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] ladies I also know what to do Jesus didn't it is written through Jesus Christ [Applause] sometimes foreign [Music] is to Bow Down and Worship the kingdom of the world look at them use your eyes the lust of the eyes so oh see that beautiful thing but you see that beautiful eyes [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] foreign according to the pride of life the devil was saying Jesus did you know you can fly some of you young people want to fly instead of going through the process yes [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] to pull you [Applause] at any time um [Music] but I'm pregnant foreign that's another position thank you Hallelujah [Music] we're gonna give you an idea I decided [Applause] it is Germany [Applause] foreign foreign [Applause] Construction [Music] together [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] in your mind they never tell you [Music] foreign [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Applause] scriptures
