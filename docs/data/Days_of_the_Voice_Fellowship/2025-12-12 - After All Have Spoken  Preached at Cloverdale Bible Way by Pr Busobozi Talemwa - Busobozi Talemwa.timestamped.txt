[13:03] Murphy, maybe you could open the service
[13:05] for us if you would please in a word of
[13:06] prayer. We do have a couple prayer
[13:08] requests we just want to bring before
[13:10] the congregation this morning. Our
[13:12] brother Ben Haynes is just asking we
[13:13] would please remember for her friend and
[13:15] co-work for his friend and co-orker's
[13:17] husband who has recently been diagnosed
[13:18] with bone cancer. His name is Ian
[13:21] Hassam.
[13:22] We could bring that prayer request
[13:24] before the Lord this morning. And also
[13:25] just continue to please remember our
[13:27] brother Neil and sister Souo in prayer.
[13:29] They're needing a touch from the Lord.
[13:31] They're back home now and just praying
[13:32] for strength that the Lord would help
[13:34] them.
[13:36] Amen. If you have a chance to reach out
[13:38] to them, I know they'd love to hear from
[13:39] you. It's lonely when you can't be in
[13:41] the congregation with the believers. And
[13:43] brother Neil, Sister Sue, if you're
[13:44] listening, we love you. Remembering you
[13:46] this morning. Let's just sing the song
[13:48] together. Fill my cup, Lord. As brother
[13:49] Murphy would come and open the service
[13:51] for us. Oh, fill my cup,
[13:56] Lord,
[13:58] as I lift it up,
[14:02] Lord.
[14:05] quench
[14:08] this thirsty love of my soul.
[14:19] Lord, feed me till I wonder.
[14:27] Here's my cup. Fill it up and make me
[14:34] whole. Fill my cup, Lord. Fill my cup,
[14:40] Lord.

[15:38] together and in your name, Lord, that
[15:41] you will be among us. So Lord with that
[15:44] confidence to what your word has said we
[15:46] come to meet our God not to meet our God
[15:49] that that judge us but we made our God
[15:52] has love us so much. We made our God has
[15:56] so will delivered us so give us the
[15:59] grace that in this lasted moment send
[16:02] the message and in this hour that

[16:08] So Lord, we coming with a bonus. We come
[16:11] in with a confidence and know that when

[23:12] I know the battle is
[24:07] Do you ever find yourself
[24:10] asking God, "How can this be?
[24:15] Ever get up out of bed saying, "I can't
[24:19] do this again?"
[24:23] Have you ever been afraid
[24:26] of what tomorrow's going to bring?
[24:31] And you're facing it alone. At least
[24:34] that's what you think.
[24:39] I can tell you after going through that
[24:42] valley,
[24:43] even though I didn't see it at the time,
[24:47] it was in my weakest moments that he
[24:50] held me. And I know you'll find he will
[24:55] carry you when you can't go on. He will
[24:59] be your strength when your strength is
[25:02] gone. He will lift you up. He will be
[25:05] enough
[25:08] to get you through.
[25:11] When the road is long and you want to
[25:14] quit, cuz you think you've got nothing
[25:17] left to give, you can fall apart. Fall
[25:21] into his arms.
[25:26] He will carry you.
[25:32] When you get the kind of news
[25:35] you hoped you never hear.
[25:40] When you're chasing down a dream just to
[25:44] watch it disappear.
[25:48] When somebody that you love turns and
[25:53] walks away
[25:56] and they leave you standing there
[25:59] with shattered
[26:01] face,
[26:04] you don't have to pick up all the broken
[26:07] pieces. You don't have to try to cover
[26:10] up the scars. You are loved and you can
[26:14] always run to Jesus just as you are. He
[26:19] will carry you when you can't go on. He
[26:23] will be your strength when your strength
[26:26] is gone. He will lift you up. He will be
[26:29] enough
[26:32] to get you through.
[26:34] When the road is long and you want to
[26:37] quit, cuz you think you've got nothing
[26:41] left to give, you can fall apart. Fall
[26:44] into his arms.
[26:49] He will carry you.
[26:54] Oh, his heart is never weary.
[26:59] No, he's never tired. Through the
[27:02] toughest fight, through the longest
[27:04] night, through the flood and through the
[27:08] fire,
[27:15] he will carry you when you can't go on.
[27:20] Be your strength when your strength is
[27:23] gone. He will lift you up. He will be
[27:26] enough
[27:29] to get you through.
[27:31] When the road is long and you want to
[27:34] quit, cuz you think you've got nothing
[27:38] left to give, you can fall apart. Fall
[27:41] into his arms.
[27:46] He will carry you.
[27:54] He will carry you.
[28:15] Amen. Have you found it so? And God
[28:17] bless you, sisters. Thank you for that.

[28:22] bumped from a different service, but
[28:23] maybe if it's all right, we'll just have
[28:24] that on Wednesday. We want to give
[28:25] brother Bus plenty of time and I think
[28:28] he might want to teach a song as well.

[34:33] Amen. I am too. Welcome those that are
[34:35] on the uh internet and hooking up in
[34:38] different ways. You know, I was with
[34:39] brother Bus here as he'll come to the
[34:41] pulpit shortly and we were just doing a
[34:42] little he was here with the church and
[34:44] we were walking around and I just was so
[34:46] aware that there's those that have
[34:49] connected with us over the years and are
[34:52] so uh part of the congregation and and
[34:55] we don't maybe see them uh maybe we'll
[34:57] never see them this side. Uh maybe it's
[34:59] that side, but they feel so connected to
[35:01] you. And so I wanted just to send a warm
[35:02] welcome to those that maybe be
[35:04] connecting this morning. Maybe everybody
[35:06] from the house of God could say, "God
[35:07] bless you."
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. There are
[35:10] many joining this morning and we welcome
[35:13] you as well into the presence of the
[35:14] Lord. God bless you. Amen. We have a
[35:18] wonderful day and really expect high
[35:21] expectations but bust just to be able to
[35:23] have you here. But you know, I wanted
[35:24] just to mention before uh we turned the
[35:26] service over, I want to thank everyone
[35:28] that came out to uh the message hub
[35:31] workshop, if I could call it that. uh
[35:33] this past Thursday, we were able to get
[35:34] so much done in one short uh evening and
[35:37] uh it was just a real blessing. I was
[35:39] talking to brother Darren there and he
[35:41] just said, you know, it just he looked
[35:43] across the fellowship hall and everybody
[35:45] was busily working. Thank you for
[35:46] bearing through the early uh early uh
[35:49] issues we were dealing with, but it
[35:50] settled in and everybody just started
[35:51] working. It was kind of just a hush
[35:53] across the whole uh Sister Sherry's
[35:55] nodding her head there. uh everybody got
[35:57] quiet and they're just clicking away on
[35:58] their computer and it uh it was just a
[36:00] real blessing to see that everybody come
[36:02] together as we were furthering the
[36:03] gospel in just a bit of a different way
[36:05] and and so there's uh different ones
[36:08] have asked is there more that can be
[36:09] done and the the uh the easy answer is a
[36:13] a resounding yes with many exclamation
[36:16] marks and uh we're going to maybe hold
[36:19] another evening in the next coming weeks
[36:21] um maybe a week or two a Tuesday night
[36:24] possibly and and so just look out for
[36:26] that announcement. We'll announce it uh
[36:27] because there's lots to be done, some
[36:29] formatting to be done and a continued
[36:32] process with aligning the uh with the
[36:34] text and the audio. And so it's uh lots
[36:38] of work to do, but we have a body here
[36:39] to do it. And so we'll let you know when
[36:41] we when that is coming in the next
[36:43] coming days. And so we so appreciate you
[36:45] being able to be a part of that, be a
[36:47] part of that. I have uh I this is an
[36:52] exciting day I know for brother
[36:54] Basaboszi. It's a long time coming. Long
[36:56] time coming. What was the year, Brother
[36:58] Bus? The first year that that uh was
[37:00] that about 207? 208, I think we were
[37:02] talking.
[37:04] 209. Okay. 209. My Brother Bus, he says,
[37:07] "I am part of this congregation." So,
[37:09] we're not welcoming a visitor this
[37:11] morning. We're welcoming part of our
[37:12] congregation this morning. Amen. As
[37:14] brother Bus has been part of the the
[37:17] services through many years. And I I I
[37:19] wrote it. I was just thinking about it
[37:20] and and I can I can remember brother
[37:22] Biscll telling us about the first time
[37:24] when brother Busabos's emails first came
[37:26] in. And I can remember brother Bisll
[37:28] telling us he just uh he just I just
[37:31] came in contact. He's not exact exact
[37:33] words but those of us that were here
[37:34] would remember brother Bisco says I just
[37:36] come in contact with somebody that is on
[37:39] fire. Amen. Brother Bus was uh just a
[37:42] young man at that time. I'm still a
[37:43] young man, younger man at that time with
[37:45] an incredible energy and zeal for the
[37:47] gospel. And I've had the privilege to
[37:49] spend some time with him in Uganda a few
[37:51] times. And I can say that zeal for the
[37:53] gospel is not diminished. It has only
[37:55] increased and uh uh with a with a great
[37:59] desire to spread the gospel that brother
[38:02] and the congregation and many around the
[38:03] world have have desired to do. And so
[38:05] we're just so privileged, brother
[38:07] Busabosi, to have you here and to be
[38:10] part of the service today. he's
[38:11] pastoring a church the days of the voice
[38:14] fellowship there in Compala and uh we
[38:16] have a we've we've spent a little bit of
[38:19] interesting times together and even some
[38:21] you know little tight tense times
[38:23] together and uh and that creates a
[38:25] certain bond and I can say brother Bus
[38:27] is a soldout man of God for this gospel
[38:30] and brother Tom preached a message
[38:32] called locktock and barrel many years
[38:34] ago brother Bus has sold out lockstock
[38:36] and barrel amen so I'm sure we'll hear
[38:38] the the the the the desire. I I thought
[38:42] of the scripture, brother Bus, this
[38:43] morning that the king of Grippa said to
[38:45] Paul, he said, "Almost thou persuadest
[38:47] me to be a Christian." And Paul said, "I
[38:49] would to God that not only thou, but
[38:51] also all that hear me this day were both
[38:53] almost and altogether such as I am." And
[38:57] I thought of you this morning that you
[38:58] are indeed one of those like Paul who's
[39:00] not just almost, but is altogether
[39:03] persuaded for this gospel. And so we're
[39:05] just so thankful that you can be here
[39:07] this morning to join with us. We'll hear
[39:09] a little bit of what God's been doing
[39:11] over through brother Bus and the
[39:13] believers there in Compala. And so we're
[39:15] going to invite you to the pulpit,
[39:17] brother Bus, as you would just have your
[39:18] liberty. I know it's maybe a little bit
[39:20] of a uh don't worry about the nerves. If
[39:22] you've been part of the congregation,
[39:23] then it's just like family.
[39:26] So just like family. But maybe as
[39:28] brother Bosabosi comes and and takes the
[39:30] the pulpit this morning. Let's just
[39:32] stand and wait. Let's just sing. Let the
[39:33] worshippers arise.
[39:36] Are you one of those worshippers this
[39:37] morning? Let's worship him not just in
[39:39] spirit. We're thankful we can worship in
[39:41] spirit and in truth now. Father, I see
[39:44] that you are drawing.
[39:47] Oh, a line in the sand. And I want to be
[39:51] stand by your side

[47:56] never fails. Amen. I'd like us to sing
[47:59] that one more time. And if you can lift

[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You never fail. You are alive. You
[49:55] are a living God. We We do not worship a
[49:58] dead God, but we worship a living God.
[50:01] Amen. A God that is alive and a God that
[50:03] is here this morning, Father. Lord, to
[50:06] minister to us and speak to us words of
[50:08] life, oh God. Amen. Maybe someone is

[50:50] just a moment.
[50:52] Hallelujah.
[50:56] Amen.
[50:57] Just want to greet each and every one of
[50:59] you in the precious name of our Lord
[51:00] Jesus Christ. Uh it's a horn and
[51:03] privilege, you know, to be here this
[51:05] morning. And I want to say thank you,
[51:07] Pastor Tom, for the invitation. We
[51:09] really appreciate you. And you know it's
[51:11] an honor to stand on this platform and
[51:13] I've been around the world a few times a
[51:15] few places and uh but it's you know
[51:18] nervous to stand here um because of what
[51:22] this place symbolizes for me you know at
[51:25] this platform uh over the years I've had
[51:28] life-changing sermons from brother Eddie
[51:30] Biscow brother Tom Ray and you know the
[51:34] other ministers and especially brother
[51:35] Biscal really um his ministry his testim
[51:40] testimony. His life made mine and I'm
[51:44] here as a witness of that this morning.
[51:46] I'm a witness here this morning that
[51:48] this message is alive.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; And what you as a church represent does
[51:53] not only stop here in Clovado. It goes
[51:56] all over the world. It goes to where I
[51:58] was way back in, you know, Uganda. And I
[52:01] want to say God bless you, brother
[52:02] Michael. And thank you for uh the um
[52:07] maybe I call it a beautiful
[52:08] introduction. You know he has become a
[52:11] friend and um someone that I think is
[52:13] the only person in the west that I call
[52:15] a buddy of mine and you know someone
[52:17] that I've come you know close to and
[52:19] because of the burden that he has for
[52:21] this message. When I first met him in in
[52:24] you know he came to to Uganda we went uh
[52:28] to parts in our country that very few
[52:31] have been able to go. I could count how
[52:33] many have been able to go. They're the
[52:35] the remotest place in Uganda called
[52:37] Karamoja. I know there might be a few
[52:40] people from Karamoja, brethren there
[52:41] that might be streaming this service.
[52:43] And so, uh, thank you, brother Michael,
[52:45] for greeting them and saying, "God bless
[52:47] you." You know, I was at brother
[52:50] Michael's house yesterday
[52:52] seeing, you know, the place where he
[52:54] lives and the place where he accepted to
[52:56] go. I want to say that that's just a
[52:59] burden to send this message out
[53:03] and I appreciate the man of God and
[53:05] brother Murphy, you know, um I've heard
[53:07] of him for years as well. The miracles
[53:10] and wonders that the Lord has performed
[53:13] through you for the Chinese language and
[53:16] the Chinese people, we hear all that and
[53:18] it encourages us and it keeps us going.
[53:20] I want to say God bless you, the
[53:22] congregation here at Clover. I'm a
[53:24] member of this church. Like brother
[53:25] Michael said, I I'm not new. I may be
[53:28] new to some of you, but I'm a member
[53:29] here. And uh I want to say thank you for
[53:33] allowing me to come and you know and to
[53:36] speak to you this morning. And thank you
[53:38] for coming to be a part of this service
[53:39] this morning. Greetings from our church,
[53:42] Days of the Voice uh Fellowship in
[53:43] Campala. My wife Sister Rebecca and and
[53:46] the family, they all sent their rigs and
[53:48] their greetings. Um many of them are
[53:51] actually uh streaming the service live.
[53:53] So uh they're part of what is is
[53:54] happening right now. I just have a few
[53:56] slides before we get into the word. I
[53:58] just don't want to you know drag the
[54:00] whole thing. Maybe I just go into the
[54:02] slides right now and uh just share a
[54:05] little bit of my testimony so that uh
[54:08] those of you who might want to know a
[54:10] little more of what the Lord has done in
[54:12] our life and what the Lord is doing can
[54:14] be able to see some pictures. Is that
[54:15] all right?
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:20] Okay. So yeah. So, um I just wanted to
[54:26] Okay. Is that moving?
[54:30] Okay. I think that picture did not come
[54:32] out right.
[54:36] No.
[54:38] Okay. That picture did not come out
[54:40] right, but that that's all right. It's
[54:42] just a a huge Anglican church.
[54:46] So, um and and you know, my father was a
[54:49] priest in the Anglican church. And you
[54:51] know, my mother was a woman preacher in
[54:53] the same church. And um after the
[54:55] confirmation, you know, there's a
[54:56] ceremony that they do every um every now
[55:00] and you know, you don't believe. They
[55:02] baptize you when you're a baby. And so
[55:04] someone else believes for you called a
[55:06] godfather. And you know, after that,
[55:09] then the bishop comes. Of course, they
[55:11] teach you for a while, maybe 6 months.
[55:13] They teach you the sacraments and blah
[55:14] blah blah, the doctrines of the of their
[55:16] denomination. And then afterwards, the
[55:17] bishop comes to confirm you as a member
[55:19] of that church. And so the bishop came
[55:21] and confirmed us and I was um requested
[55:26] then to speak give a a a speech to thank
[55:29] the bishop for that and I was one of
[55:31] them that was requested to speak and the
[55:34] bishop was impressed and he requested me
[55:36] to go and and and leave with him at his
[55:39] uh decision palace. It was there at you
[55:43] know I'll just try to make it a little
[55:44] bit brief and not go into the lengthy
[55:46] testimony. So it was there that I
[55:47] started preaching at the age of 13 by
[55:49] God's grace and you know the bishop one
[55:52] time we were on the dining and then he
[55:53] looked at me and he said talima can you
[55:56] preach? Well, you could not say no to a
[55:59] bishop. And and so I said yes by the
[56:02] grace of God. And that would be the very
[56:04] first time the following day that I I
[56:06] preached my first sermon at age 13. And
[56:09] but you know, God had other plans as
[56:12] much as I thought that I'm from a
[56:14] religious background and I'm I'm I'm a
[56:16] son of a priest and I'm going to be a
[56:18] bishop. That was my ambition by the way.
[56:19] I wanted to be a bishop in the Anglican
[56:21] church cuz I thought that's the best you
[56:23] can do to serve the Lord. I know
[56:25] different now. And and so at at age 15,
[56:29] you know, the message came my way and um
[56:31] I I at brother Michael's house and the
[56:34] family, I was able to go into the
[56:36] details of that. But unfortunately
[56:37] because of um not so much time that we
[56:41] have this morning, I'll just give you a
[56:42] little bit of a brief.
[56:44] you know um I I started staying at a a a
[56:49] family friend's house family friend who
[56:52] happened to be a pastor in this message
[56:54] because in that town where I was after I
[56:57] left the bishop's house was um the only
[57:00] place that was available for me to stay
[57:02] at was at a family friend who actually
[57:05] happened to be a pastor in this message.
[57:08] And so my my my mom knew that. And so
[57:10] she told me, "Well, I'm going to leave
[57:12] you here, but I warn you." And she
[57:14] showed me a p the picture, brother
[57:15] Bannam, with a pill of fire on it. He
[57:17] said, "I warn you. These people uh uh
[57:19] worship this man, so please don't join
[57:21] them." I said, "Mom, you know, you know
[57:23] me better than that. I cannot join them.
[57:25] I I'm going to uh I'm going to to help
[57:28] them." And and so I was only 15 years of
[57:32] age at the time. And I I was keen the
[57:35] whole time for about 6 months. I was
[57:37] listening to what they had to say but I
[57:39] was waiting for them to bow before the
[57:40] picture which never happened and so it
[57:43] troubled me but everything they were
[57:44] saying was in the scriptures. I had
[57:46] heard about water baptism godhead
[57:47] serpent seed and all these teachings and
[57:49] I could see it is bibilical. So I was
[57:51] wondering why would they then worship a
[57:52] man and so I was waiting for them to bow
[57:54] before the man and it never happened
[57:56] until one time I asked I asked the
[57:58] pastor brother Leo I said uh who is this
[58:01] man he said oh it's a good question. So
[58:03] he opened the Bible immediately and I
[58:05] thought how is that connected? How is
[58:07] the picture of this man connected to the
[58:09] Bible? Uh but you know he took me to
[58:11] several scriptures and you know Malachi
[58:13] 4 and Isaiah 61 and Luke Luke 1 and you
[58:18] know several other scriptures.
[58:19] Revelation 10:17 uh 10:7 and you know uh
[58:23] he was able to introduce to me the
[58:26] ministry of Elijah. And so I saw clearly
[58:30] from the scripture before we even talked
[58:31] about the man that there is an Elijah to
[58:33] come to restore all things. And and so
[58:37] um I I saw that and it was clear but
[58:40] then he said who is the man? Do you know
[58:41] who the man is? Uh he mentioned a few
[58:44] names. I said I'm not too sure. I can't
[58:46] say. I can't say. He said well is it
[58:47] your bishop? I said I can't no. Then he
[58:50] said so who is this man? I said I don't
[58:53] know. He said okay then I'll tell you
[58:54] who this Elijah is. And so he started
[58:57] introducing to to me the ministry of
[58:58] brother Banam and who brother Banam is
[59:00] and went into the details and and that
[59:03] um you know went into these his his um
[59:06] you know what we know and about brother
[59:08] Banam and his beginning and his ministry
[59:10] and but that convinced me that it was
[59:14] like the truth but it did not move me to
[59:17] join him and be a part of uh of their
[59:19] church and you know I continued staying
[59:21] with them and so in the morning I would
[59:23] go to my church early in the morning
[59:24] very early in the we hours of the And
[59:26] then midm morning I would come back to
[59:28] uh their church because I had no place
[59:30] to go. I was staying with them and so I
[59:32] would come back to their church and but
[59:34] long story short this day was the
[59:37] changing um uh was I can say the turning
[59:41] point in my life. You know I was seated
[59:43] in one of the uh pews in the church in
[59:45] the Anglican church and it was a woman
[59:47] preacher that came up a woman priest of
[59:49] course with all the robes and everything
[59:50] and and so um I knew it was wrong. So
[59:54] the scriptures my mind kept on pointing
[59:56] me back again to Timothy 1 Timothy
[59:58] chapter 2 and you know other scriptures
[1:00:02] I knew it was wrong but then I was like
[1:00:04] okay it's just one time it's just a day
[1:00:07] it will just pass and but that was the
[1:00:10] day that God had plans to move on my
[1:00:14] heart and you know um they told us to
[1:00:18] turn in the in the rear side of the
[1:00:20] church and we started um are rehearsing
[1:00:24] the Apostles Creed. The Apostles Creed.
[1:00:26] I don't know how many know the Apostles
[1:00:28] Creed.
[1:00:30] Okay. Yes. Maybe those of you who were
[1:00:32] born in the message don't understand
[1:00:34] what the Apostles Creed is, but these
[1:00:36] are some of the creeds that you know we
[1:00:37] used to rehearse and sing and I believe
[1:00:39] in this, I believe in that, I believe in
[1:00:40] and then there's this phrase and I
[1:00:42] believe in the holy Catholic church. I
[1:00:45] said, well, I thought I was Protestant
[1:00:47] cuz Anglican is Protestant. Then I
[1:00:49] believe in I'm a part of the Catholic
[1:00:51] Church. you know that moved on my heart
[1:00:53] and um in a in a nutshell there was a
[1:00:56] baptistry way in the back and so there
[1:00:59] there were these you know parents with
[1:01:02] their children and and you know the
[1:01:03] priest would come and and ask um who is
[1:01:06] the godfather of this child one by one
[1:01:08] they did that one by one who is the
[1:01:10] godfather of this child and and one
[1:01:12] person would come up say yes myself he
[1:01:14] said okay name this child and then they
[1:01:16] would name the child then they would ask
[1:01:18] the child the priest would ask the child
[1:01:20] um a few questions like um are you ready
[1:01:22] to recount the world and follow the ways
[1:01:24] of Jesus Christ blah blah blah blah and
[1:01:26] then the the godfather of course the
[1:01:28] child was way too young to understand
[1:01:30] what what is going on so the the
[1:01:32] godfather would say yes I do I was like
[1:01:35] this is fake it's it's not real and and
[1:01:40] as the as the priest took the water from
[1:01:42] the baptistry to baptize this child and
[1:01:44] I baptize you in the name of the father
[1:01:46] you know right there at that moment the
[1:01:49] atmosphere changed around me I began to
[1:01:51] feel different and I never knew he's got
[1:01:54] a whirlwind but then I had a while a
[1:01:56] while a while you know in my ears and
[1:01:58] around my head and woo woo and you a
[1:02:02] voice came out of it and spoke to me I
[1:02:05] heard it as clear as you're hearing me
[1:02:07] and say tala take the nearest exit and
[1:02:10] leave this place because you're in the
[1:02:11] wrong place and it came two and three
[1:02:14] times and on the third time I just took
[1:02:17] my Bible and swung my way out of that
[1:02:19] church but I was confused. confused
[1:02:21] because I had I have I tried to look
[1:02:22] around to see whether others were
[1:02:23] hearing what I was hearing but it was
[1:02:25] clear that nobody was hearing it but me
[1:02:28] and so I had no place to go. Remember
[1:02:30] midm morning I would go to the message
[1:02:31] church. So that day I go to this message
[1:02:33] church and I find a brother who his name
[1:02:35] is Paul. He was preaching like a man
[1:02:38] with cords of fire under his feet and
[1:02:40] you know and he was speaking about
[1:02:42] everything I left in my church and you
[1:02:45] know he was speaking about that woman
[1:02:46] Jezebel and you know talking about the
[1:02:48] false church system and it just you know
[1:02:51] cut me to the heart and and you know he
[1:02:54] he and at the end of the service then he
[1:02:57] would say how many of you know they knew
[1:02:59] me well. I had been there for about 6
[1:03:00] months and I had never made a decision.
[1:03:03] be patient with people who linger even
[1:03:05] when they don't make a decision. God is
[1:03:07] moving in their hearts. And so God was
[1:03:10] moving on my heart and at that moment
[1:03:12] you know that presence came back again
[1:03:14] and you know I heard a voice and spoke
[1:03:16] to me these words. He said Talm stand up
[1:03:19] on your feet,
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; lift up both your hands and proclaim on
[1:03:23] the top of your voice that you have
[1:03:24] believed this message. It is the truth
[1:03:26] and that you'd like to be baptized in
[1:03:28] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Those
[1:03:30] are the words I heard. I'm just a
[1:03:32] witness of what I heard.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; And those words came twice. The third
[1:03:37] time I found myself cuz I don't know
[1:03:40] something happened. I found myself
[1:03:41] standing up and tears flowing my down my
[1:03:44] eyes and I had one of my hands up and I
[1:03:47] said those words and people were about
[1:03:50] 10 15 in this little town at that time
[1:03:53] believers of the message. But when they
[1:03:55] started, you know, shouting and clapping
[1:03:57] their hands, you would think it's like
[1:03:59] 200 or or 300 people, it looked like
[1:04:03] there was a great rejoicing and a
[1:04:05] presence of the Holy Spirit there. And I
[1:04:08] was baptized that day. So when I came
[1:04:10] out of the water, I made up a pledge
[1:04:13] before the Lord. I said, "Lord, you've
[1:04:15] moved on my heart. From this day on, I'm
[1:04:18] going to go everywhere around the world
[1:04:20] and testify that this message is true."
[1:04:22] Amen.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so at age 17 and you know
[1:04:27] that is 2 years later I came I I had so
[1:04:30] many questions and I wanted to know more
[1:04:32] things and what's the message? What's
[1:04:33] everything? What was the beginning of it
[1:04:35] and everything so I started going on the
[1:04:37] internet to try and research and try to
[1:04:38] find out more. I I wanted to spread the
[1:04:41] message but there's much about the
[1:04:42] message that I did not know. And so
[1:04:44] that's when I came across this church
[1:04:47] and I saw brother Biscal preach and that
[1:04:51] did not leave me the same. It did not
[1:04:53] leave me the same. It did not leave me
[1:04:56] the same. And I wanted to get in touch
[1:04:58] with that man. I I tried my best. I
[1:05:01] tried my best but I failed. And then one
[1:05:04] time I I see um a man you know
[1:05:07] contacting me um happened to be brother
[1:05:09] Victor Admira who is just here this
[1:05:11] morning. God bless you brother Victor.
[1:05:13] And later on I learned that brother Ed
[1:05:15] had asked him to check check out this
[1:05:17] young man. Who is he? What is he trying
[1:05:18] to do? And you know and later on brother
[1:05:20] Ed answered me one of those uh emails
[1:05:23] and the rest is history. But I want to
[1:05:26] say that I learned so much. What I am
[1:05:29] today the ministry and what God has
[1:05:31] accomplished in my life is because of
[1:05:33] this ministry. The the life and
[1:05:35] testimony of brother Ed and and and the
[1:05:37] the services after services that I
[1:05:40] streamed that I listen to. And I want to
[1:05:42] say to you, the congregation here and
[1:05:44] especially brother Tom, I was telling
[1:05:45] brother Tom that he has been serving um
[1:05:50] together with brother Ed for more than
[1:05:52] 50 years. I want to say that that's a
[1:05:55] life that has been surrendered to this
[1:05:57] message and we appreciate the men of God
[1:05:59] that have labored not minister to you as
[1:06:01] a congregation but to all of us over the
[1:06:03] years.
[1:06:05] And so um
[1:06:12] when I had my wedding
[1:06:15] um I I was just uh preparing for my
[1:06:18] wedding and you know I um just before my
[1:06:22] wedding I of course I had already got
[1:06:24] this burden to move around the world and
[1:06:26] I know you've heard this part of the
[1:06:28] story from other brethren and other
[1:06:30] ministers even from this platform but uh
[1:06:32] I'd like to give you my side of the
[1:06:34] testimony and what the Lord did. You
[1:06:36] know, God always works from both ends.
[1:06:38] And, you know, um I I I needed somebody,
[1:06:41] you know, from the church here to be a
[1:06:43] part of uh of our of our life. And and
[1:06:46] you know, brother brother Tim, we
[1:06:48] invited him out of what the Lord had um
[1:06:50] showed me and I had already shared it
[1:06:52] with my pastor, brother Leo, that God
[1:06:54] showed me when someone is asking me to
[1:06:56] change my wedding dates to another date.
[1:07:00] And I don't know why but you know two
[1:07:02] weeks later brother Tim asked me to
[1:07:04] change my wedding debts and I had to
[1:07:07] move it. Brother Leo told me well that
[1:07:08] is the Lord. There must be something
[1:07:10] there must be a reason. And by the way
[1:07:12] for about 2 years I had had this burden
[1:07:15] to go out into Ethiopia and I did not
[1:07:19] know anyone in Ethiopia. I tried to
[1:07:20] reach out to a few people and you know I
[1:07:23] I was rejected down flat and you know I
[1:07:26] had talked with brother Victor about
[1:07:28] Ethiopia several times and I had told
[1:07:31] him about the burden I had and we were
[1:07:32] talking over for some time and later on
[1:07:36] you know when I was rejected by there's
[1:07:38] a brother who was uh living in Ethiopia
[1:07:41] at the time and he asked me he said u he
[1:07:44] asked me a few questions I won't you
[1:07:46] know bother you with the details of them
[1:07:48] it was like an you. I think I failed
[1:07:51] those questions terribly, you know,
[1:07:53] because he was asking me how old I am
[1:07:54] and how long I've been preaching and
[1:07:56] everything. So, he said, "I'm I'm sorry
[1:07:58] I can't have you come uh uh you know,
[1:08:01] because the the two major reasons was
[1:08:04] you don't know the language of the
[1:08:05] people here and also you don't have the
[1:08:07] money to to get along and to take care
[1:08:09] of yourself here. So, I cannot receive
[1:08:11] you in Ethiopia. It's not as um the same
[1:08:13] as your country. I will not have you."
[1:08:15] So, I was I felt rejected. I felt bad.
[1:08:18] So I went before the Lord and I led two
[1:08:20] fleces before him. I said, "Lord, if
[1:08:21] it's a will for me to go into the
[1:08:24] country and take this message." That's
[1:08:26] all the burden that I had. Then opened
[1:08:29] the door, provide for me the funds to go
[1:08:32] without having to ask anybody.
[1:08:35] And also I said, "Lord, if it's your
[1:08:37] will, then provide a sovereign contact
[1:08:40] without me having to beg anybody to to
[1:08:42] receive me into the country."
[1:08:44] And uh so we we we had my wedding and uh
[1:08:48] brother Tim came for my wedding and
[1:08:51] about 17 brother Kim Dingo I don't know
[1:08:53] whether he's around uh here
[1:09:00] well uh I think brother Kim and his wife
[1:09:03] and a few others came and you know I was
[1:09:06] in Australia some time back I found a
[1:09:07] sister in that church quiz church that
[1:09:09] was on my wedding I was so so amazed and
[1:09:13] I see the sister over here. She was at
[1:09:15] my wedding too. And you know, so we were
[1:09:17] just very little at the time. And you
[1:09:20] know, brother Tim uh said, "Look, I I'm
[1:09:23] going to offer you uh a honeymoon as my
[1:09:26] gift as our gift u from to you for a
[1:09:30] honeymoon to Ethiopia." He did not even
[1:09:32] know how long and what I had gone
[1:09:34] through to get into the country and the
[1:09:36] rejection I had already received in the
[1:09:38] country. And so he said, "Don't worry."
[1:09:41] before I answered him, he said, "Don't
[1:09:42] worry about the funds. We are going to
[1:09:45] provide those funds." So, God had
[1:09:47] already answered the first fleas that
[1:09:49] had laid before him. And and and so, um
[1:09:53] then we we pick up uh you know, we pick
[1:09:56] up uh the you know, my laptop and I'm
[1:10:00] with my wife. We trying to book the
[1:10:02] ticket to go to Ethiopia. And here on
[1:10:04] the laptop, someone calls me. I do not
[1:10:07] know them. I've never talked with them.
[1:10:08] I knew a few people in Nairobi but this
[1:10:10] was a new face and this man tells me and
[1:10:13] don't I have about 30 pictures to show
[1:10:15] you this will be the only time um that
[1:10:18] I'll take and then I'll just run through
[1:10:20] them. So, but this man then told me that
[1:10:24] um I I had put up a website at the time
[1:10:26] and I had called it the youth message
[1:10:28] site and my purpose was to reach out you
[1:10:31] know to the pe the young people with
[1:10:33] this message of the hour. So he said I
[1:10:36] have this burden is an Kenyan man in
[1:10:38] Nairobi and he tells me I have this
[1:10:41] burden to reach among Ethiopian people
[1:10:44] but I do not have the means to go to
[1:10:47] Ethiopia and well in my heart I said I
[1:10:49] have the means already and so he said um
[1:10:53] but I came across your picture and I I
[1:10:55] had you know gone um to there's a um
[1:10:58] kind of a place where many uh Ethiopians
[1:11:02] leave the refugees in Nairobi. called
[1:11:04] East Lee. And so he said, "I've gone to
[1:11:07] East and um I've preached this message
[1:11:10] and a few Ethiopians have believed this
[1:11:12] message." Uh but before I could baptize
[1:11:14] any of them, I came across your website
[1:11:16] and the Holy Spirit ministered to me and
[1:11:19] he said, "Call this brother to come and
[1:11:21] be the one to baptize them." And so
[1:11:23] that's why I'm calling you. He said,
[1:11:24] "Would you please come?" I said,
[1:11:26] "Brother, you don't have to ask me would
[1:11:28] I please come. I'm coming right away
[1:11:30] with my wife." And so we changed. We we
[1:11:32] never went straight to um Adisaba. We
[1:11:35] went via Nairobi by road and and so
[1:11:38] that's how the the Lord answered both
[1:11:42] places. He provided the funds and I I
[1:11:45] did not know what he would do with this
[1:11:47] but I felt like baptizing an Ethiopian
[1:11:49] from the blue there must be something to
[1:11:51] eat. So we went to Nairobi and uh
[1:11:56] um
[1:11:59] okay
[1:12:02] you see this man right over here his
[1:12:05] name is Dissa it was in May 2013 he was
[1:12:09] the first Ethiopian to be baptized and
[1:12:13] you see that man I don't know if I can
[1:12:15] be able to do I have to point through
[1:12:18] okay wait
[1:12:21] yeah this man over here, his name is
[1:12:23] Justin Veroga. I've never even talked
[1:12:26] with him after that. I don't know which
[1:12:27] church he comes from. And and so he was
[1:12:30] the one that uh called me. I never knew
[1:12:32] him at the time. And and so this man,
[1:12:35] you know, as I started talking to him,
[1:12:36] he said, "You're wasting my time. Just
[1:12:38] get me to the water, baptize me because
[1:12:39] I've already believed the message." And
[1:12:42] so I uh we took him, you know, I was
[1:12:44] very young. You can see at the time over
[1:12:46] here is Pastor Wikliffe. He's the pastor
[1:12:47] of the church where the people that I
[1:12:49] knew. So I connected with them and we
[1:12:51] used their baptism tank and we baptized
[1:12:53] this brother and u so this man came out
[1:12:56] of the water and he gave me two contacts
[1:12:58] one of his brother his biological
[1:13:00] brother and another one of his uh priest
[1:13:03] he said please go to Ethiopia and take
[1:13:05] this message to my people and so we I
[1:13:08] reach Ethiopia. This picture you see
[1:13:11] here is the I remember brother Biscal
[1:13:13] showed this picture here. Uh some of you
[1:13:15] who have good memory can remember his
[1:13:17] name is Evangelist Biru. This man
[1:13:22] Yeah. This man when he heard
[1:13:25] the message
[1:13:29] okay
[1:13:31] when he heard the message he told me
[1:13:32] everything I've heard is the truth but
[1:13:36] I'm a priest in the Lutheran church.
[1:13:38] There's no I I I had too many people.
[1:13:40] There's no way I can leave. So, please
[1:13:44] continue. You have my blessing. He
[1:13:46] hugged me. He was speaking those words
[1:13:47] as he was hugging me. Continue preaching
[1:13:49] this message. You You have an open door
[1:13:51] in this country, but I'm sorry. I I
[1:13:53] can't be one of those that will follow
[1:13:55] this message, but I believe it. Continue
[1:13:57] preaching it. It was confusing. I
[1:14:00] couldn't understand that. And and so,
[1:14:02] and he he was crying, by the way, while
[1:14:04] he was saying those words. And then he
[1:14:06] left. And then I called the brother to
[1:14:09] uh the second contact. And this is the
[1:14:12] second contact right there, brother
[1:14:14] Kumasa. And he happened to be the very
[1:14:16] first one in Ethiopia to receive this
[1:14:19] message. When he came, he he traveled
[1:14:21] 100 kilometers. And he heard everything
[1:14:24] we had to say. And he came out and he
[1:14:26] said, "Look, I've already received."
[1:14:28] Just like his brother Nairobi, he said,
[1:14:29] "I've already received this message. I
[1:14:31] would like to be baptized right away."
[1:14:33] And we baptized him right away. And then
[1:14:36] after of course you see we're using
[1:14:38] bathtubs cuz we did not have any access
[1:14:40] to water at the time. And uh so then he
[1:14:44] um calls he he go gets on the phone
[1:14:46] immediately after water baptism. This is
[1:14:48] after his baptism. He gets on the phone
[1:14:50] and he calls this woman. He says he he
[1:14:52] tells me that is this woman that is
[1:14:54] coming. She's on fire. She's a prayer
[1:14:55] warrior. I want her to receive this
[1:14:57] message. And so uh this happened to be
[1:15:00] uh Sister Yordit. Um uh I know many of
[1:15:03] you have heard about Sister Yordit and I
[1:15:06] I talk about Sister Yodit because Yudit
[1:15:09] is a woman when she came she changed my
[1:15:12] perspective of outreach of reaching out
[1:15:15] to new people. Of course she had
[1:15:16] earrings and you know you know necklace
[1:15:19] and you know trous pants and you know
[1:15:21] the way she was I was like is this the
[1:15:23] prayer warrior I've been told and this
[1:15:26] is a Jezebel.
[1:15:28] So as I started talking to her, I was
[1:15:31] not you know like giving her my all and
[1:15:33] and you know she designed that she was a
[1:15:35] spiritual woman.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; She told me look don't waste my time. I
[1:15:40] have been praying the whole night and
[1:15:42] the Lord spoke to me that someone is
[1:15:44] coming with a message for me from
[1:15:47] another country and that's why when
[1:15:48] Kumasa called me I have come and I
[1:15:50] thought you were the one but the way you
[1:15:52] are talking it doesn't look like you
[1:15:53] have any message for me. If you have any
[1:15:55] message for me give it to me. if you
[1:15:56] don't don't waste my time. I'll just
[1:15:58] leave. It was like a rebuke, a very
[1:16:00] sharp rebuke. I I I I had to apologize
[1:16:04] to the Lord and I opened up and I, you
[1:16:06] know, just brought out everything and
[1:16:09] from from I can say Genesis to
[1:16:11] Revelation and she received the whole
[1:16:13] message right away. And by the time we
[1:16:15] were done, it's 9:00 p.m. and she says,
[1:16:18] "I want to be baptized." We couldn't
[1:16:20] find water. So, she came in the very
[1:16:21] early in the morning. By the way,
[1:16:22] remember this is our honeymoon. So, so
[1:16:25] she comes uh she comes very early in the
[1:16:28] morning and we we were able to take her
[1:16:31] for baptism. The following day, the
[1:16:34] following day, it was Sunday and here we
[1:16:37] we this was my very first time to preach
[1:16:40] in any Ethiopian church. It was a
[1:16:41] Lutheran church and she was one of the
[1:16:43] interpreters. I asked brother Ed can I
[1:16:45] don't have an interpreter but I've been
[1:16:47] invited because Kumasa talked with the
[1:16:49] with his pastor and you know they
[1:16:50] invited us to go and so brother Ed told
[1:16:53] me well brother uh brother Bernham had a
[1:16:56] a a woman interpreter in Finland if
[1:16:58] there is nobody to help she can help and
[1:17:00] so she helped but you know uh as we were
[1:17:04] preaching we we talked about Mark 16 he
[1:17:06] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:17:08] saved and he that believeth not shall be
[1:17:10] damned and so I said what comes first
[1:17:13] baptism or belief
[1:17:14] Everybody said believing. So then when
[1:17:18] the pastor saw this is the pastor right
[1:17:20] there on the right. When he saw the
[1:17:22] direction we were taking, he said um he
[1:17:25] started talking to Yit and told told
[1:17:27] her, "Look, this is way out of our
[1:17:29] doctrine. You have to stop." And she she
[1:17:31] said, "No, we cannot stop. this is a man
[1:17:34] of God and this is a message from God
[1:17:35] and the people you cannot hinder them
[1:17:37] and you know they're behind me talking
[1:17:39] and so I'm left without an interpreter
[1:17:41] because Y was interpreting in the local
[1:17:43] the from English to Amharic and the
[1:17:45] pastor was interpreting from uh Amharic
[1:17:48] to Afano Roma the the the other language
[1:17:51] and so the service could not continue
[1:17:56] but uh I I I tell you what um that was
[1:17:59] our first trip and you know on the
[1:18:01] second trip I I started going with a
[1:18:03] friend of mine, brother brother Paul uh
[1:18:06] um to to Nairobi um I mean the one who
[1:18:10] lives in Nairobi. I started going with
[1:18:11] him to Ethiopia and I'll share one
[1:18:13] testimony with him. We the Lord
[1:18:16] accomplished a lot of things. But I can
[1:18:18] share this cuz you've heard of this and
[1:18:20] you know one time I'm walking on the
[1:18:22] street with brother Paul and it is night
[1:18:26] around 9:00 p.m. and there's you know we
[1:18:28] hear someone tapping on us and
[1:18:31] you know it is brother Paul because
[1:18:33] brother Paul had been in the world. I've
[1:18:34] never been in the world before. So he
[1:18:35] understood right quick that you know
[1:18:37] this is a a prostitute. And so he tells
[1:18:40] me uh she's a prostitute. I said how did
[1:18:43] you know? You know he explained to me.
[1:18:44] So I said, "Okay, so how are we going to
[1:18:47] to go about it? Should we just run away
[1:18:48] or should we um uh talk to her?" Um so
[1:18:53] she couldn't talk good English. So we
[1:18:55] decided that we will make an appointment
[1:18:57] with her when Sister Yod is available
[1:18:59] and then if she wants to come, you know,
[1:19:01] she can come. And
[1:19:03] long story short, she comes the
[1:19:05] following day. We had an appointment in
[1:19:07] the evening hours and she comes, you
[1:19:09] know, all made up and I think she
[1:19:11] thought she was going for business and
[1:19:13] but look, brother Paul was here, but
[1:19:15] myself and sister Yodit had come as well
[1:19:17] and we all had our Bibles ready. And so
[1:19:20] when she walks, she it's like she walked
[1:19:22] into an ambush and and so she she felt,
[1:19:26] you know, different. She was like, "Uh,
[1:19:28] is it is everything fine?" Say, "Yeah,
[1:19:29] yeah." So we quickly introduced
[1:19:31] ourselves as preachers through the
[1:19:33] interpreter. Of course the sority was
[1:19:34] now the one interpreting and and so we
[1:19:36] told her everything that you know why
[1:19:38] why we're in Ethiopia what we are doing
[1:19:39] and uh after hearing the message for
[1:19:42] about an hour she tells us look uh
[1:19:44] brothers uh uh she said look gentlemen I
[1:19:47] have been in in this business for 10
[1:19:50] years this is all that I know to do I
[1:19:54] cannot lie to you that I can be able to
[1:19:56] have the strength within myself to
[1:19:58] overcome and so I I suggest that uh you
[1:20:01] don't let me test God you don't Let me
[1:20:03] play with the blood of Jesus. With order
[1:20:05] is not by power or by might, but by the
[1:20:08] spirit of God. And and so I have never
[1:20:13] seen the Holy Spirit grip somebody so
[1:20:16] much in that magnitude, that kind of
[1:20:19] person that way. when we we begin to
[1:20:21] speak in that direction, the Holy Spirit
[1:20:23] just took a hold of on her and she
[1:20:26] started you know she started um you know
[1:20:30] saying well in this case I'm ready if if
[1:20:34] it's not by my power but by his power I
[1:20:36] am ready I like to be baptized and we
[1:20:39] baptized her that same day I tell you
[1:20:42] this message has power
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; even prostitutes can be converted
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; and so where many of the people I just
[1:20:49] run through the rest and so we can be
[1:20:51] able to go to the word and you know this
[1:20:54] was uh the baptism of brother Morgus and
[1:20:57] this is
[1:21:00] June 2014 and I know brother Murphy and
[1:21:02] uh brother Tom have been in Adis Sababan
[1:21:05] I've met brother Morgus this is June of
[1:21:07] 2014 and you know the Holy Spirit led us
[1:21:11] to go to this uh uh school and it's a
[1:21:15] it's a university I I I I have a dream
[1:21:18] and you know I I'm not a kind of person
[1:21:20] that always wants to follow dreams but I
[1:21:22] have this dream and you know we are by
[1:21:24] the coffee shop at a university. So I
[1:21:26] asked sister audit we were with brother
[1:21:28] Paul we asked sudit is there a
[1:21:30] university that you can suggest that we
[1:21:31] go to she said well there are many
[1:21:33] universities in this country but and
[1:21:34] then she started speaking them one by
[1:21:36] one and then
[1:21:38] nothing clicked in my heart and then she
[1:21:40] says Adamama University. Adama sounded
[1:21:42] Jewish and I said what does Adamama
[1:21:44] mean? She said it means Nazareth. I said
[1:21:48] we will go to Nazareth because you know
[1:21:50] can anything good come from Nazareth and
[1:21:52] and and you know right by the coffee
[1:21:55] shop is where we find a few young men
[1:21:57] you know they were you know students
[1:21:59] some of them law students others
[1:22:00] engineers but you know from from that
[1:22:04] place that's where we found brother
[1:22:06] Morgus and you know when the message got
[1:22:08] a hold of him it never let go
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; and I want to say uh now 2021 we
[1:22:14] ordained him as the pastor of the church
[1:22:16] after we existed and went back to
[1:22:18] Uganda. Isn't that amazing?
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; And uh you can now see the church. I
[1:22:22] know you've seen many pictures of these
[1:22:24] and uh they have had many special
[1:22:26] meetings uh with the team coming over
[1:22:29] and many brothers have come out of that
[1:22:31] original work and started out different
[1:22:34] you know works and this is 2025. We
[1:22:35] ordained another brother there as a
[1:22:38] pastor of another church brother Ephraim
[1:22:39] in another place.
[1:22:41] Uh there's a church in Awasa
[1:22:44] and
[1:22:47] That's the church in Aasa. I know I saw
[1:22:49] brother Gary Walker visit here and
[1:22:50] that's brother Gary Walker one time he
[1:22:52] was just going somewhere and he went
[1:22:54] through there. All those brothers you
[1:22:56] can see by by the left
[1:22:59] are now pastors of this message
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; in Ethiopia.
[1:23:06] Uh
[1:23:09] well then uh we we we we went back to
[1:23:12] Uganda where we currently are and I did
[1:23:14] not know what to do. Uh because when we
[1:23:17] went to Ethiopia, we thought we were
[1:23:18] going to become Ethiopians.
[1:23:20] We tried to get citizenship. They
[1:23:22] couldn't give citizenship. It's funny.
[1:23:24] An African country cannot give another
[1:23:26] person from another African country
[1:23:27] citizenship. So we could not you know
[1:23:30] move to Ethiopia and then you know
[1:23:32] another law came that we cannot stay in
[1:23:34] the country unless we have theology
[1:23:36] uh unless we qualify for theology. So we
[1:23:38] had to exit and go back to Uganda. And I
[1:23:40] did not know what to do going back to
[1:23:42] Uganda. But you know the Lord had other
[1:23:44] plans as well. And so we we got uh a
[1:23:49] place there in Campala and started
[1:23:52] having fellowship in my house. And if
[1:23:55] you see on this next picture there on
[1:23:57] the computer, some brothers in other
[1:23:59] places in Ethiopia also would stream us
[1:24:02] uh would with us on Zoom because they
[1:24:05] did not have ministers. Now they have
[1:24:07] ministers so they don't have to do that.
[1:24:09] And so we it was like a home fellowship
[1:24:12] and you know we became uh we expanded
[1:24:15] and you know we were able to get another
[1:24:18] location in 2022 and and later on
[1:24:22] expanded and got a larger place where we
[1:24:25] were very honored to have pastor Tom
[1:24:27] come and brother Mike has come several
[1:24:29] times actually. Brother Mike has come
[1:24:31] before when we were still in this little
[1:24:32] place. we call it a leadershop and and
[1:24:35] so um uh it was a blessing to have you
[1:24:38] brother Michael and and uh
[1:24:42] then you know God has expanded us now
[1:24:44] and have a congregation of about 120
[1:24:47] people and uh every year we have annual
[1:24:50] youth meetings and brother Michael
[1:24:52] opened them for us. the very first youth
[1:24:54] camp that we had, he came and preached
[1:24:57] those meetings and and you know the
[1:24:59] vision for youth for youth meetings I
[1:25:01] can say it was was birthed in me out of
[1:25:05] what I used to feist on on your cloal
[1:25:10] Bible way camp.
[1:25:12] I would watch all those services after
[1:25:15] service and I would be impacted. I like
[1:25:18] no my people in Uganda need something
[1:25:20] like this. We now have something like
[1:25:23] that in Campala and and uh so these are
[1:25:26] the meetings we've had different ones
[1:25:28] come. Brother Andrew Glover and brother
[1:25:31] Timothy Prut and brother Michael has
[1:25:32] been there and it's been a blessing to
[1:25:34] the region the entire region and God has
[1:25:37] also you know been giving us an open
[1:25:41] door to new areas in Uganda in Karamoja
[1:25:44] where the message has been there since
[1:25:46] the 1980s but uh they've never had even
[1:25:51] one message book in their language and
[1:25:54] you know when brother Michael came I
[1:25:55] took him up there and he was able to see
[1:25:58] I And some of the we were driving one
[1:26:00] time and you know the road ended and we
[1:26:02] had no more road and we had to go
[1:26:04] through a bush. This is reality. Brother
[1:26:06] Michael was just with me right there and
[1:26:08] um and we lost a a tire and uh but you
[1:26:12] see these are people that love the Lord
[1:26:14] but had no access to the message. and uh
[1:26:18] you know but now we started you know uh
[1:26:21] translating and we've been doing this
[1:26:24] project with um with uh Bible believers
[1:26:27] and now we've we we have translated the
[1:26:31] church age book and finished it
[1:26:33] completed it and distributed it to the
[1:26:35] Karamoja brethren and we so we print we
[1:26:38] have a little printing u operation in
[1:26:41] Kala where we have our young people from
[1:26:43] my church they just come and help to
[1:26:45] collect and to to do the printing and
[1:26:46] they volunteer their time to do that. So
[1:26:48] every month we print 12,500 messages not
[1:26:52] only in one language. We we we do
[1:26:55] Luganda language, we do Atoeso, we do
[1:26:57] Karamojong. And these are all new
[1:26:59] languages, especially Ateso and
[1:27:01] Karamojong languages that have not had
[1:27:03] the message in their language before.
[1:27:07] And now they have the message. And you
[1:27:08] know, when when brother Tom came, these
[1:27:11] ministers had to, you know, I heard the
[1:27:14] testimony here as they were giving it. I
[1:27:15] need to give you this back end.
[1:27:18] They when they heard that brother Tom
[1:27:20] was coming, brother Michael, they had to
[1:27:22] travel more than 10 hours. Many of them
[1:27:26] I I couldn't even like they wanted to
[1:27:28] come. Many I told them look you have to
[1:27:29] limit yourself. The reason why they
[1:27:31] wanted to come to just tell him thank
[1:27:34] you for giving us the message in our
[1:27:35] language and we had 27 ministers from
[1:27:39] Karamoja and about um uh you know 20
[1:27:43] from another region.
[1:27:45] And I I tell you this message has not
[1:27:48] only changed our life but has changed
[1:27:50] our life so that we can change other
[1:27:52] people's lives. And I want to say thank
[1:27:54] you for having um a ministry here that
[1:27:58] has been a blessing to the bride around
[1:28:00] the world. I'm a product of this
[1:28:03] ministry.
[1:28:06] I know many are asking, do you have a
[1:28:08] family? Yes, of course. When I got
[1:28:09] married, the Lord did not stop there. He
[1:28:12] he he blessed us with a family and I
[1:28:14] have five children now and and and um
[1:28:18] and God has been God has been good. God
[1:28:21] has been good. Well, God bless you.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:31] I wonder if we can stand and just uh try
[1:28:34] to go to the word. Do we have any more
[1:28:36] time for preaching this morning? Uh
[1:28:38] where I I know I I was told that we had
[1:28:40] 1 hour so we have one extra hour you
[1:28:42] know. So
[1:28:45] praise the Lord. I just love the Lord.
[1:28:49] Amen.
[1:28:51] Amen. Shall we sing a little chorus just
[1:28:52] to change the order of the service? Be
[1:28:54] still and know that I am the Lord. Amen.
[1:28:57] We can just sing it even without the
[1:28:58] music. Amen.
[1:29:01] Be still
[1:29:05] and know just lift up your voice that I
[1:29:12] am God.
[1:29:15] Be still
[1:29:18] and know
[1:29:21] that I
[1:29:25] am God.
[1:29:28] is still
[1:29:32] unknown
[1:29:35] that I
[1:29:39] am God.
[1:29:42] I am
[1:29:46] the Lord
[1:29:49] that he
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:59] and the Lord
[1:30:03] that he
[1:30:06] let thee.
[1:30:10] I am
[1:30:13] the Lord
[1:30:16] that he
[1:30:20] led thee.
[1:30:24] loving Jesus. As we now going to turn
[1:30:27] our pages of our Bibles, Lord, and get
[1:30:30] into what you have for us this morning.
[1:30:32] I've waited upon you and you've laid a
[1:30:34] burden on my heart. Something to speak,
[1:30:37] Lord, to your people, Father. Not that I
[1:30:39] have anything to say, but that Lord, you
[1:30:41] would come and say something that will
[1:30:43] be a blessing to each of us. Father,
[1:30:45] take me out of the way, Lord, and take
[1:30:47] all the nervousness away and use me,
[1:30:49] Father, to be a blessing to your people
[1:30:51] now in the precious name of Jesus
[1:30:53] Christ. Amen. Shall we turn to the book
[1:30:57] of Romans, chapter 8,
[1:31:06] verses 28.
[1:31:18] And by the way, brother Steven sent you
[1:31:20] greetings. I know he's well known here.
[1:31:22] He asked me to greet you in the name of
[1:31:25] Jesus Christ.
[1:31:27] Amen. We're reading Romans 8
[1:31:31] 28-30.
[1:31:33] And we know that all things work
[1:31:35] together for good to them that love God,
[1:31:37] to them who are the called according to
[1:31:39] his purpose.
[1:31:41] For we for whom he did for know he also
[1:31:44] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:31:46] image of his son that he might be the
[1:31:49] firstborn among many brethren. Moreover,
[1:31:51] whom he did predestinate them he also
[1:31:54] called and whom he called them he uh he
[1:32:00] also justified and whom he justified
[1:32:02] them he also glorified. You believe
[1:32:05] that? Say amen.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Please be seated.
[1:32:10] Uh can I have more sound in the monitor
[1:32:12] if if possible?
[1:32:16] I just want to speak to you on a subject
[1:32:18] this morning after all have spoken
[1:32:22] in the message the faith of Abraham.
[1:32:23] Brother Bham said God called Abraham
[1:32:25] because he was a a good man is it's a
[1:32:27] question. Did God call Abraham because
[1:32:30] he was a good man?
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; No. And the answer is no. He says no.
[1:32:34] God called Abraham by election. God
[1:32:38] elects people. In the book of Ephesians,
[1:32:40] the first chapter and about the fifth
[1:32:41] verse, Paul states the word
[1:32:43] predestinated us to adoption of sons.
[1:32:46] Now, that doesn't mean that God just
[1:32:48] puts you in a little channel and runs
[1:32:50] you through and you can't help, you
[1:32:53] know, how you go. He says that will be
[1:32:55] no reward, but God gives you the free
[1:32:58] moral agency to make your choice. But
[1:33:01] God will keep his believer. And that's
[1:33:04] mot right there. God will keep his
[1:33:06] believer. You know God told Cain one
[1:33:08] time if you do well will you not be
[1:33:10] accepted. The first time I heard that I
[1:33:13] was like okay serpent seed. I thought he
[1:33:15] cannot believe but then God said I will
[1:33:18] accept you. So Cain you know had to make
[1:33:22] a choice even you know he had to make a
[1:33:24] choice but Cain made a different choice
[1:33:27] because to do well he needed spiritual
[1:33:30] revelation of the will of God. And all
[1:33:33] our choices in life are guided by the
[1:33:35] revelation that we have.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet you know in the
[1:33:40] Patmos vision says
[1:33:42] we should pray for God.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; For a revelation by his spirit
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; without faith. Without revelation it is
[1:33:49] impossible to please God.
[1:33:51] Cain could not please God. God was more
[1:33:54] than able to accept Cain. God wanted to
[1:33:57] accept Cain. God does not want anyone to
[1:33:59] be lost. But you see, Cain had nothing
[1:34:03] in there acceptable.
[1:34:06] But God had a, you know, always in every
[1:34:08] generation has a group of people in
[1:34:11] every race, in every tongue, every, and
[1:34:14] I know here we're multicultural church.
[1:34:17] I say God has a people out of every
[1:34:19] culture, out of every nation, out of
[1:34:21] every race that will not be denied.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; And I'm so happy that I am one of them.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. When they hear the word, something
[1:34:29] on the inside says amen to that word.
[1:34:33] Amen. These are the called. They are the
[1:34:36] called according to his purpose.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; You know, they were predestinated to be
[1:34:42] conformed to the image of his son.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; You know, we continue that what it says
[1:34:48] predestinated looks back. You know,
[1:34:50] predestination looks back to fornowledge
[1:34:52] and fornowledge looks onto destiny. That
[1:34:55] God being infinite in the beginning knew
[1:34:57] the end from the beginning. Therefore,
[1:34:59] he knew what people would do.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; He knew what you would do. He knew the
[1:35:05] choices that you would make.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; So, he could foretell what would take
[1:35:10] place for he knew what would be.
[1:35:14] Therefore, because Esau and Jacob either
[1:35:17] one was born, before either one was
[1:35:20] born, God could say, "Esau I've hated
[1:35:23] and Jacob have loved because he forneew
[1:35:27] what they could be."
[1:35:29] He, you know, he says he never made Esau
[1:35:31] the way he was. He wasn't willing that
[1:35:34] Esau would be that way. And I believe
[1:35:36] for Cain even the same thing. But Esau,
[1:35:40] brother Bam says, Esau by choice. God
[1:35:44] knew would take that way. So that's how
[1:35:48] he knows us today. He knows your heart.
[1:35:51] You might be able to fool your neighbor.
[1:35:53] You might be able, he says, to fool your
[1:35:54] pastor, but you will never be able to
[1:35:57] fool God. Why? Because God knows your
[1:36:01] heart. God knows my heart. Therefore, by
[1:36:04] election, he chose Abraham. For he knew
[1:36:07] what Abraham would do. You remember when
[1:36:09] he called him out of there, he said he
[1:36:11] did not uh keep the thing a secret from
[1:36:14] him. When he was going down to destroy
[1:36:17] Sodom and Gomorrah, he said, "For I know
[1:36:19] that Abraham will teach
[1:36:22] his children."
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; I know
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Abraham will teach his children.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; I know. I know it. God himself. I know
[1:36:32] that Abraham would send this message on
[1:36:34] down from one generation to another. God
[1:36:38] knew that about Abraham. But God for
[1:36:40] knowing that and knowing that Abraham
[1:36:42] would do it, knowing that Abraham would
[1:36:44] do it, then he told Abraham in the
[1:36:46] beginning that he would save him and
[1:36:48] save his seed after him
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; and he would give him the unconditional
[1:36:54] covenant.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Not because Abraham was good,
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; but because God was good.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; God called you. God called me because he
[1:37:08] knew all the choices that I would make.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; He knew all the choices that you would
[1:37:13] make. He has confidence in you. It's not
[1:37:17] about me. It's not about you. It's about
[1:37:18] him that called you. He has confidence
[1:37:21] in you.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; No matter what is happening in my life,
[1:37:25] no matter what is happening in our life,
[1:37:26] in your life as an individual, he has
[1:37:28] placed this message in our hands.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Do you know why he has placed this
[1:37:33] message in our hands? because he knows
[1:37:35] this that you would believe it.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why God brought this message to
[1:37:42] me? Because he knew I would believe it.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; He knew you would believe it. He knew
[1:37:46] you will live it too.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; You He also knew that you would send
[1:37:51] this message on down to another
[1:37:53] generation. Amen. Can I remove my cord?
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:37:58] Hallelujah. I was just thinking friends
[1:38:01] why among all the people and you know
[1:38:04] this morning at that I I have nothing to
[1:38:06] preach to you really you've had the best
[1:38:09] ministry in the world but I'm just going
[1:38:11] to speak my heart and just just give me
[1:38:14] your undivided annotation and let the
[1:38:17] Lord minister to us this morning
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; you know I I was just thinking friends
[1:38:21] why among all the people in the world
[1:38:23] there are so many people in the world
[1:38:26] that met brother Bham so many people
[1:38:28] that made brother Bham. But why brother
[1:38:31] Eddie Biscow? Why in that manner?
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; And there are many who met him and you
[1:38:38] know they made you know a kingdom for
[1:38:40] themselves and uh you know became
[1:38:42] something but brother Biscal right until
[1:38:45] the end he would say we I'm nothing but
[1:38:48] a preacher of the gospel. Why why would
[1:38:51] he call you?
[1:38:54] Listen, this means he knew why God
[1:38:57] brought the message to him, to brother
[1:39:00] Ed. Because he knew that brother Ed
[1:39:03] would take it on down from generation to
[1:39:06] generation.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. The reason why he called me, the
[1:39:10] reason why he called you, God has a
[1:39:12] purpose in your life. He didn't just
[1:39:14] call you. He has a purpose in your life.
[1:39:17] He has something to accomplish in your
[1:39:19] life. Amen.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; You see, this means he knew you would
[1:39:22] surely not compromise the word. You
[1:39:25] know, talk about good stewards of this
[1:39:27] sacred trust. He knew you would not
[1:39:29] compromise the word. That's why he
[1:39:31] called you to believe this message of
[1:39:33] Yahw.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I can say to you
[1:39:36] mothers, he knew you would teach your
[1:39:38] children.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. To you fathers, he knew you would
[1:39:41] live by example and raise a seed for the
[1:39:45] glory of God.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. to you preachers. You know, he
[1:39:48] knew you would preach this word without
[1:39:50] a seminary experience but with zeal and
[1:39:53] responsibility.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was just telling brother Tom, is
[1:39:57] this all right? I was just telling him
[1:39:58] that uh you know I I saw coveret the way
[1:40:01] that you've been over the years
[1:40:03] consistent and you know standing behind
[1:40:04] a ministry and you know without wanting
[1:40:07] to you know be seen and everything you
[1:40:09] know why brother Tom of all people that
[1:40:11] God would place him there to just be
[1:40:13] such a support in brother Biscar's
[1:40:16] ministry even after you know take over
[1:40:18] the work why because God called him
[1:40:20] because he knew what he would do.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; God makes no mistakes.
[1:40:27] Hallelujah. He would call a man. Amen.
[1:40:29] Because he he knows that this man would
[1:40:31] have a zeal. He would have a
[1:40:33] responsibility for this message of the
[1:40:35] hour.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; And I said to the young people like me
[1:40:38] here this morning. Amen. We are here.
[1:40:41] You are here. You are the called. You
[1:40:44] are not just called. You are the
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; God has confidence in you. He is
[1:40:49] counting on you.
[1:40:51] Do not let the devil ground you because
[1:40:54] of, you know, these little things, this
[1:40:56] or that. And God is counting on you. God
[1:41:00] is counting on me. God is counting on
[1:41:02] us. Since I received this message,
[1:41:04] friends, I've never allowed the devil to
[1:41:07] ground me because of the little things
[1:41:09] that have happened in my life. I've
[1:41:11] always known this one thing. God has
[1:41:12] called me to be a witness in my
[1:41:14] generation.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're going to take, you
[1:41:18] know, Job and go through him and see.
[1:41:21] I'm going to speak to you this morning
[1:41:22] on the subject after all have spoken.
[1:41:26] Job 1:es 1 to3. He says, "There was a
[1:41:28] man in the land of whose whose name was
[1:41:30] Job. And that man was perfect and
[1:41:33] upright, and one that feared God, and
[1:41:35] esceded evil, and there were born unto
[1:41:38] him seven sons, and three daughters. His
[1:41:41] substance also was 7,000 sheep and 3,000
[1:41:44] camels and 500 yoke of oxen and 500
[1:41:46] shees and a very great household. So
[1:41:50] that this man was the greatest of all
[1:41:52] the men of the east.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; So God knew Job and God had called Job
[1:41:57] for a time such as this. And now see you
[1:42:01] know when God calls you, Satan is always
[1:42:04] near.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. The way is good and is effectual,
[1:42:08] but there are always many adversaries.
[1:42:12] Job 1:6, let's look at it. I know you
[1:42:15] know it, but I have a few scriptures
[1:42:16] here and there that we will read. Not
[1:42:18] all of them, but just a few to give you
[1:42:20] the picture here. And as I build this
[1:42:22] little foundation, it says verses six,
[1:42:24] now there was a day when the sons of God
[1:42:26] came to present themselves before the
[1:42:28] Lord, and Satan came also among them.
[1:42:31] And the Lord said unto Satan, whence
[1:42:33] comest thou? Then Satan answered the
[1:42:36] Lord and said, "From going to and fro in
[1:42:38] the earth, and walking up and down in
[1:42:39] it?" And the Lord said unto Satan, "Hast
[1:42:42] thou considered my servant Job, that
[1:42:46] there is none like him in the earth, a
[1:42:48] perfect and upright man,
[1:42:52] one that fearth God and escueth evil."
[1:42:56] Then Satan answered the Lord, and said,
[1:42:58] "Do Job fear God for not? Hast not thou
[1:43:01] made a hedge about him and about his
[1:43:03] house and about all that he has on every
[1:43:04] side? Thou hast blessed the work of his
[1:43:07] hands and his substance is increased in
[1:43:09] the land. But and the devil suggested,
[1:43:13] "Put forth his thine hand now." And he
[1:43:18] said, "Put forth thine hand now and
[1:43:20] touch all that he has, and he will cast
[1:43:22] thee to thy face." And the Lord said
[1:43:25] unto Satan, "Behold, all that he has is
[1:43:28] in thy power, only upon himself, put
[1:43:32] forth not thy hand." So Satan went forth
[1:43:36] from the presence of the Lord. I'm
[1:43:38] imagining if I can picture that, you
[1:43:40] know, Satan speaking to God about Job,
[1:43:43] Satan speaking to God about you, and
[1:43:46] then God goes like, "Really? You think
[1:43:49] because of what I've given you, that's
[1:43:50] why he loves me. That's why he's saying,
[1:43:52] "Glory, hallelujah. That's why he le is
[1:43:53] leaving for me. You think because of
[1:43:55] what I've given him,
[1:43:58] God has confidence in his elect.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And so he says, "Well, you
[1:44:03] can go ahead and touch him. Go and do
[1:44:05] whatever you want to do." And then look
[1:44:07] at verses 13.
[1:44:10] And many who came when this happened
[1:44:12] when he was touched and uh things
[1:44:14] started going the wrong direction and
[1:44:16] people started to speak. Amen.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; And the first, you know, servant came
[1:44:22] and, you know, gave a a testimony and
[1:44:24] and and he said the Sabbian the the
[1:44:27] Sabbians fell upon the oxen and the
[1:44:29] asses and took them away and killed the
[1:44:31] servants. Bad news for Job. The second
[1:44:35] servant came in verse 16. He said while
[1:44:36] he was yet speaking while the first
[1:44:38] servant was yet speaking. The other came
[1:44:40] and and also another and he said the
[1:44:42] fire of God is falling up upon from
[1:44:44] heaven and has burned up the sheep and
[1:44:46] the servants and consumed them and I
[1:44:48] only am kept alone to tell thee. And
[1:44:51] then the servant the third servant came
[1:44:53] and while the other was speaking and he
[1:44:55] said three bands of the uh calaldians
[1:44:58] fell upon the camels and carried them
[1:45:00] away and killed the servants. Then a
[1:45:02] fourth servant came. I mean like it was
[1:45:04] bang after bang after bang after bang of
[1:45:06] bad news.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; There came a great wind from the
[1:45:09] wilderness and small the house and all
[1:45:11] the children are dead.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Bad news. But then at that moment Job
[1:45:18] arose and rent his mantle and shoved his
[1:45:22] head and fell down upon the ground and
[1:45:25] worshiped.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what the bride does.
[1:45:31] No matter what is happening. Amen. We
[1:45:33] are created to be worshippers.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and he said naked came out of
[1:45:39] my my mother's womb and naked shall I
[1:45:41] return. The Lord gave and the Lord
[1:45:42] taketh away. Blessed be the name of the
[1:45:45] Lord. And in all this Job sin not nor go
[1:45:49] charged God foolishly. You know what?
[1:45:52] The one that is called of God cannot
[1:45:53] sin. The Bible says that they are that
[1:45:55] are born of God cannot sin.
[1:45:59] Now that was the first phase. The devil
[1:46:03] thought uh you know well I would bring
[1:46:06] my best and then it didn't work. He was
[1:46:08] like ah this did not work. I need to go
[1:46:10] back and try something else. But you
[1:46:12] know he cannot do anything without
[1:46:14] permission.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Therefore I don't want you to worry
[1:46:17] about whatever is happening in our life
[1:46:19] because God
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; has given the devil permission for
[1:46:22] whatever is happening. Why? Because he
[1:46:24] has confidence in you. He knows you
[1:46:26] cannot fall away. He knows nothing is
[1:46:28] going wrong because everything is
[1:46:30] working out for his glory and his
[1:46:32] purpose in your life.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; And you know uh the second phase in Job
[1:46:36] 2:1 again there was a day when the sons
[1:46:39] of God came to present themselves before
[1:46:41] the Lord and Satan came along uh also
[1:46:43] among them to present himself before the
[1:46:45] Lord. And the Lord said unto Satan,
[1:46:47] Fromce comest thou? And Satan answered
[1:46:50] the Lord and said from going to and fro
[1:46:53] in the earth and from walking up and
[1:46:56] down in it. Isn't it what the devil
[1:46:58] specializes in doing? Just just going
[1:47:01] about in the message victory day,
[1:47:02] brother Bam says that's what the devil
[1:47:05] is so after us about. That's what the
[1:47:08] devil is so after the bride. Amen. The
[1:47:11] church. So for now it's getting close to
[1:47:14] V day.
[1:47:16] He says that's right. She's getting real
[1:47:18] close. The de the devil knows that it's
[1:47:22] getting really close to the change of
[1:47:24] our bodies. Why? Because this is the
[1:47:27] purpose why the message came.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; That's when the enemy does his worst to
[1:47:33] reroute to reroute. The Bible said why
[1:47:36] unto the earth because the devil is like
[1:47:38] a roaring lion in the last days going uh
[1:47:41] going around devouring what he will.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; You see why unto them the persecutions
[1:47:48] and things will take place and hold
[1:47:51] right to it. Don't you move
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; right or left, stay right with that
[1:47:57] word.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; God said, "So that does it." Stay right
[1:48:00] with the word.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Just stay with me here. Something I'm
[1:48:06] trying to get to with the message future
[1:48:08] home of the heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:48:09] earthly bride.
[1:48:11] He says, "Satan is defeated." That's a
[1:48:14] proclamation. We ought to say amen to
[1:48:16] that.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Satan is defeated.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; He knows. He knows. He's on the earth.
[1:48:23] He is going like a roaring lion. It
[1:48:26] isn't long till he is finished.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; He knows his time. He's going like a
[1:48:32] roaring lion. That's all he knows what
[1:48:34] to do to just go around like a roaring
[1:48:37] lion, but he is not a lion. He's like a
[1:48:40] roaring lion, but he's not a lion.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; But you know what? We know what a lion
[1:48:46] is. We have the lion of the tribe of
[1:48:48] Judah.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. But remember, the prince of peace
[1:48:52] stands by. Amen. I'm talking to
[1:48:54] believers. The prince of peace always
[1:48:57] stands by.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The great divine one. The
[1:49:03] architect of my being. The architect who
[1:49:06] built me what I am. I love the song I
[1:49:09] heard you sing, brother Ryan. Amen. What
[1:49:11] I am, who I am. I know who I am. Who
[1:49:14] built you what you are is here.
[1:49:18] If the architect who knows how to put
[1:49:20] the building together it's right place
[1:49:23] who knows better than the architect.
[1:49:26] It's a question who knows better than
[1:49:28] the architect
[1:49:29] does Satan know and he is here the
[1:49:33] architect to prove himself that he is
[1:49:37] here.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; You know one thing that I love about the
[1:49:42] message is that brother Bernham never
[1:49:44] spoke presumptuously.
[1:49:46] When he spoke, he meant it. And you know
[1:49:48] what? God always came down to prove it.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. God always proves his word.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And all right, stay with me
[1:49:57] right here. Now, demonology, religious
[1:49:59] room, he says, and we know that Satan is
[1:50:01] gone about like a roaring lion
[1:50:04] everywhere devouring what he will
[1:50:07] wearing. Now, huh, now brother Bam
[1:50:08] begins to now explain to us how the
[1:50:10] devil comes. He says, wearing religious
[1:50:13] cloaks.
[1:50:15] Oh God, these poor little children, look
[1:50:18] at them everywhere. They are open and
[1:50:19] exposed to the people and and I pray
[1:50:22] thee, oh God, to be merciful to them and
[1:50:25] save all the lost, heal the sick. And
[1:50:27] God, we realize that these old devils of
[1:50:29] sickness coming upon your children that
[1:50:31] you have an atonement laying yonder to
[1:50:34] take care of that. And all the devils
[1:50:35] that would cause them to sin, you've got
[1:50:38] an atonement laying yonder.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; You will take care of it. And I pray
[1:50:43] that you will grant it in Jesus name.
[1:50:45] And we all say amen. You know what? He's
[1:50:49] able to do it just before the end of
[1:50:51] this service.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Uh look, we'll just
[1:50:56] continue with that a little bit. On
[1:50:57] verses three, he says, "And the Lord
[1:50:59] said unto Satan,
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; hast thou considered my servant Job that
[1:51:04] there is none like him in the earth, and
[1:51:06] a perfect and unap man, and one that
[1:51:08] fearth God and excuseth evil? And still
[1:51:11] he holdeth fast his integrity. Although
[1:51:15] thou movest me against him to destroy me
[1:51:18] him without cause. And Southern answered
[1:51:21] the Lord and said skin for skin. Yeah.
[1:51:26] All that a man has will he give for his
[1:51:29] life. But put forth thine hand now and
[1:51:32] touch his bone and his flesh. He will
[1:51:35] cast it to thy face. And the Lord said
[1:51:37] unto Satan, Behold. Is that what you
[1:51:40] think? Behold, he is in thy hand,
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; but save his life. Amen. You know what?
[1:51:47] God can let Satan loose on your life,
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; but he can never touch your soul.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. My soul in his is in his hands.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; So, Amen. And he says, "So went certain
[1:51:58] forth from the presence of the Lord. And
[1:51:59] smart job, we saw bold from the soul of
[1:52:03] his feet under the under his crown, and
[1:52:05] he took him a ported to scrap himself
[1:52:09] with, and he sat down upon the ashes."
[1:52:15] And then when that happened, the fifth
[1:52:18] person spoke, and this happened to be
[1:52:21] the wife of Job. She said, "And then
[1:52:24] said his wife unto him, Dust thou still
[1:52:26] retain thy integrity? Cast God and die."
[1:52:30] But he said unto her, "Thou speakest as
[1:52:32] one of the foolish women speak." What?
[1:52:34] What shall we receive good at the hand
[1:52:36] of God? And shall we not receive evil?
[1:52:39] In all this did not job sin with his
[1:52:42] lips.
[1:52:44] And you know in in Ismanian church age,
[1:52:46] brother Bham begins to talk about you
[1:52:48] know character and and and you know
[1:52:51] suffering and and I understand I I
[1:52:54] understand that very well you know and I
[1:52:57] believe every believer understands that
[1:52:58] very well because God molds each of our
[1:53:01] character and I I know you've heard that
[1:53:04] this quote many times but well just
[1:53:06] allow me to read it. Why does he stand
[1:53:07] by? The reason is Romans 8:17 to 18. And
[1:53:10] if children then hairs, hairs of God,
[1:53:13] and joint hairs with Christ, if so be
[1:53:14] that we suffer with him, that we may
[1:53:16] also be glorified together. For I recall
[1:53:18] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:53:20] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:53:22] glory that shall be revealed in us.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Unless we suffer with him, we cannot
[1:53:27] reign with him. You have to suffer to
[1:53:29] reign. The reason for this is that
[1:53:30] simply character can never be made
[1:53:33] without suffering. Character is a
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; victory. Character is our victory. All
[1:53:40] right. And then he says, "Not a gift. A
[1:53:42] man without character cannot reign
[1:53:45] because power apart from character is
[1:53:48] satanic.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; But power with character is fit to
[1:53:52] rule." And and since he wants us to
[1:53:55] share, amen, with him with his he wants
[1:53:58] us to share even his throne on the same
[1:54:00] basis that he overcame and he sat down
[1:54:02] in his father's throne, then we have to
[1:54:05] overcome. Then we have to overcome. But
[1:54:08] remember, you cannot overcome without
[1:54:11] fighting.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; So then you have to overcome in order to
[1:54:15] sit with him. And you know what the
[1:54:17] promise of our generation ladia is to
[1:54:19] sit to rule with him on his throne.
[1:54:22] Amen. So we have to overcome in order to
[1:54:24] sit with him. And the little temporary
[1:54:27] who is suffering here today? Well, you
[1:54:29] may not to raise up your hand, but if
[1:54:30] you're suffering, Amen. This is for you.
[1:54:32] The little temporary suffering we go
[1:54:35] through now is not worth to be compared
[1:54:39] to the glory. Amen. That will be
[1:54:42] revealed in us when he comes.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, what treasures are laid up. Amen.
[1:54:48] For those who are willing to enter the
[1:54:51] kingdom through much tribulation. I want
[1:54:53] to say, but God is faithful.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; He will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:54:58] above what you are able.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. But with the temptation, you what?
[1:55:03] You'll always make a way of escape.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to say to us in this
[1:55:08] generation, God, whatever you are going
[1:55:10] through, God has made a way for escape
[1:55:12] for you.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; You just haven't found it yet. But it's
[1:55:15] just right there, brother. Amen. Because
[1:55:18] this message can never lie. It's true.
[1:55:20] Let me tell you, if you want to know
[1:55:22] whether the message is true, I have
[1:55:24] tested it. I've seen Amen. You know what
[1:55:27] the mother who told me? Amen. That those
[1:55:30] people believe in a man and they worship
[1:55:32] a man. She's in my church. I'm her
[1:55:34] pastor.
[1:55:36] Hallelujah. But but but before that it
[1:55:40] was a big temptation for me, you know,
[1:55:42] because she said, "You are no longer my
[1:55:44] son. I've disowned you." Ah, I suffered,
[1:55:48] brethren. I suffered. My mother, I loved
[1:55:51] her because my father had already gone,
[1:55:52] you know, when he retired priesthood, he
[1:55:54] just went away with other women. And you
[1:55:57] know, my mother is all I had. And she
[1:56:00] says, "I've disowned you." So it was
[1:56:01] very painful. But you know what? At that
[1:56:04] time, I thought it was very painful, but
[1:56:06] I did not know what God had prepared.
[1:56:08] She's in the church now. Brother Mike
[1:56:10] has been there right at our house. And
[1:56:11] uh you know, but Pastor Thomas seen her
[1:56:14] and shook her hand. Praise the name of
[1:56:15] the Lord. What are you going through
[1:56:17] this morning? As long as you are the
[1:56:19] bride, let me prophesy to you. You are
[1:56:22] going to overcome.
[1:56:24] Now let me tell you that's not speaking
[1:56:26] presumptuously. It is a sure word of
[1:56:28] prophecy.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because in every age there
[1:56:33] are overcomers.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; That means Amen. If you're going through
[1:56:36] something and you are the elect, you
[1:56:38] must overcome.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Not that you cannot oh it is within you
[1:56:44] or you're going to do something over.
[1:56:45] No, it is because it is prophesied.
[1:56:48] He knew what you would do. Amen.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; You are going through it because you
[1:56:53] remember you are part of the overcomers
[1:56:55] in this ladian age. Let me be plain.
[1:56:58] Matter of fact, you are overcoming
[1:57:00] already. Amen. You are overcoming
[1:57:04] already. No matter what it is, sometimes
[1:57:05] it is a disease and a sickness and you
[1:57:07] know it weighs you down. And you know,
[1:57:10] let me tell you, God, the God of this
[1:57:12] message is alive.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; He's alive.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. There came a sister. Her name is
[1:57:18] Sister Boo. She was on one of the
[1:57:20] pictures and you know Sister Bus was one
[1:57:22] of the very very first believers in the
[1:57:23] church when we when we started out and
[1:57:26] uh so she came one time and you know in
[1:57:28] my little study and she told me she said
[1:57:31] pastor she was crying and she said
[1:57:33] pastor my brother is dying
[1:57:36] and I said what's wrong with him he said
[1:57:38] he has tuberculosis and he has been sick
[1:57:40] for more than 6 months so they sent him
[1:57:42] to a bigger referral hospital here in
[1:57:44] Adisaba which is the biggest referral
[1:57:46] hospital in the in the country and
[1:57:47] almost people who go there almost all of
[1:57:49] them die from TB and so he was isolated
[1:57:52] there in isolation and when I I told her
[1:57:55] well I just encouraged I said look our
[1:57:57] God is alive but not that I have any
[1:58:01] gift of healing I don't have any gift of
[1:58:02] healing not that I know of but but I I I
[1:58:05] have a message that I know works
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; praise God and so I told her Luke let us
[1:58:12] go and pray for him cuz that's all she
[1:58:13] wanted and you know she came to her
[1:58:15] pastor and you know she believes with
[1:58:16] all her heart said you you know let's go
[1:58:18] and pray for him. So I asked brother
[1:58:20] Morgus, you know, who was um assisting
[1:58:22] me at the time, I said, "Let's go and
[1:58:23] pray for uh for for this uh uh for this
[1:58:26] man." So when we went to the hospital,
[1:58:28] we were declined. We were told, "You
[1:58:30] cannot enter here." Why? Because the
[1:58:33] place is highly contagious and you are
[1:58:35] not approved to enter here. You don't
[1:58:36] have masks. You don't have, you know, we
[1:58:38] had to plead because the sister was very
[1:58:40] desperate. And I had to I told the
[1:58:42] nurse, I said, "Look, whatever happens,
[1:58:44] count it on us. If you want us to sign
[1:58:46] anywhere, we can sign. we are preachers
[1:58:47] of the gospel. We just want to go in and
[1:58:49] out, pray in and out. So she said,
[1:58:51] "Well, it's all right. You can go
[1:58:53] ahead." And so we we arrived there and
[1:58:56] when I saw that site, it was the worst
[1:58:59] sight that I've ever beheld in my life.
[1:59:01] You know, it was just a skeleton,
[1:59:05] you know, barely no almost no breath.
[1:59:08] And this man was just lying there on the
[1:59:10] bed and they were just covering
[1:59:13] almost all his body and just the head.
[1:59:15] and he was on oxygen and he couldn't
[1:59:16] breathe on his own. all hair gone and
[1:59:18] you know he was in that state and oh I
[1:59:21] just remember you know when you listen
[1:59:22] to the message it you know puts a faith
[1:59:25] in you you know I remembered all the
[1:59:28] meetings that brother Banham would you
[1:59:29] know pray for different people and would
[1:59:31] say believe he's here he's here if you
[1:59:33] believe with all your heart is here you
[1:59:34] know you're trouble so I I began you
[1:59:37] know remembering all that and knowing
[1:59:39] that look if I serve the same God of the
[1:59:41] message he can be able to do something
[1:59:42] here and to make matters worse down in
[1:59:46] his village they had already dug his
[1:59:48] grave
[1:59:49] because they knew of course he was going
[1:59:51] to die in just a few days. So they were
[1:59:52] preparing for his burial and and so um I
[1:59:56] didn't do much. I tried to speak to him
[1:59:58] uh and but I I couldn't you know make
[2:00:00] out anything out of him. And so we we
[2:00:02] just laid our hands. I told him we're
[2:00:04] going to pray for you and the sister was
[2:00:05] interpreting. Brother Margus was
[2:00:06] interpreting rather. And so we prayed uh
[2:00:09] we prayed for him and and just I quoted
[2:00:12] Mark 16 and Lord you say that his son
[2:00:14] shall go with them that believe and they
[2:00:16] shall lay hands on the sick and the sick
[2:00:18] shall recover. Amen. And so we laid our
[2:00:20] hands and prayed in the name of the Lord
[2:00:22] and we left. We prayed for maybe just a
[2:00:24] little less than a minute and left. You
[2:00:27] know brethren in just two weeks in just
[2:00:31] two weeks that man was healed.
[2:00:36] They took him off of oxygen and his hair
[2:00:39] began to grow back
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; and he came all the way from the
[2:00:43] mountain the isolation center where he
[2:00:44] was. He came walking. He said, "I cannot
[2:00:46] go by car. I have to prove to the devil
[2:00:48] that God has healed me." He came walking
[2:00:51] down from mountain and to the church and
[2:00:54] you know for the first time I saw
[2:00:55] someone showcasing a miracle. He came in
[2:00:57] the church and he was testifying to the
[2:00:59] people and he started running around
[2:01:00] said God has healed me and the village
[2:01:03] chiefs you know the denominational
[2:01:06] people they called they called him and
[2:01:08] they said we want to see those people
[2:01:09] who healed you and we want to we we want
[2:01:11] to see them because you they called him
[2:01:13] in Amharic it is called Alaza meaning
[2:01:17] the second Lazarus. We want to see uh we
[2:01:19] want to see the second Lazarus and we
[2:01:21] want to see the God who healed the
[2:01:22] second Lazarus. So we told him well we
[2:01:25] are not like faith healers but we are
[2:01:26] preachers of the gospel. If we come we
[2:01:28] are going to preach the message. So he
[2:01:30] communicated it back and forth. So we we
[2:01:33] were accepted to go. So we went and here
[2:01:35] the whole village had gathered and then
[2:01:38] they had come maybe they were seeking
[2:01:40] for miracles but we had to give a
[2:01:42] disclaimer right there. You know the
[2:01:44] brothers I was with they were just new
[2:01:46] in the message. So they were they kept
[2:01:48] on pushing me pastor let us hold a
[2:01:49] healing you know revival meeting. You
[2:01:51] know this is a very good ground and
[2:01:52] everything. If I told him, look, I I I'm
[2:01:54] not a fifth here. I I am given the
[2:01:56] message and I'm supposed to send this
[2:01:58] message out. God will do his work.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; The message works, my brothers and
[2:02:03] sisters. And so, we preached the
[2:02:04] message. We simply preached the message
[2:02:06] of salvation for their souls. And told
[2:02:09] them, look, if you are sick in your
[2:02:11] body, receive this God, receive this
[2:02:14] message, then you'll also be healed in
[2:02:16] your body. And I tell you what, many of
[2:02:18] them were not only healed in their body,
[2:02:20] but they received this message and they
[2:02:22] were baptized in the name of our Lord
[2:02:23] Jesus Christ.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, it is very
[2:02:27] difficult in that village. So one by one
[2:02:29] we are coming through and they they
[2:02:30] would tell you don't tell others that
[2:02:32] have come, don't tell others. Until
[2:02:33] almost all the village was baptized.
[2:02:36] I tell you what friends, we are
[2:02:38] overcoming.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; If you have a disease, you are
[2:02:41] overcoming your disease. Amen. Do not
[2:02:43] say this is beyond what I can bear. God
[2:02:46] has confidence that you are going to
[2:02:48] overcome this. Amen. Of course, not
[2:02:50] without a fight.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; I do not care what it is. Heart trouble,
[2:02:54] cancer, headaches. I mean, demons come
[2:02:57] in many names. You know, you know
[2:02:59] tinitus. Have you ever heard of tinitus?
[2:03:01] Is a demon too. Baroness and rejection
[2:03:04] and fear, anxiety and depression and
[2:03:06] there are so many demons you know you
[2:03:08] know taking especially fighting our
[2:03:11] younger generation. Let me tell you the
[2:03:14] young people are going through many
[2:03:15] things that we can never I work with
[2:03:17] young people back at home and I will
[2:03:18] tell you they are going through things.
[2:03:20] Sometimes you are talking with them in
[2:03:22] you know in the interviews and oh my you
[2:03:25] like oh god what can I do for this
[2:03:26] person cuz you are hearing things that
[2:03:28] you never struggled with. The devil is
[2:03:30] coming in many colors but our God is
[2:03:33] here because his word is the same
[2:03:35] yesterday, today and forever.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; The word has never lost his power. All
[2:03:40] those sins that so easily beset you. You
[2:03:42] are overcoming them, just feed on the
[2:03:44] word every day. Stay with the word. And
[2:03:47] you know these three friends of Job and
[2:03:49] you know they came by and um you know
[2:03:51] Elifas and the Temonite builder, the
[2:03:53] Shuhide and Zofa the N the Namathite and
[2:03:57] and and they were with him for about
[2:03:59] seven days and no one said a word
[2:04:01] because of the troubles he was going
[2:04:03] through. But then after a while you know
[2:04:05] eleas you know came out and said but who
[2:04:07] can withhold himself from speaking who
[2:04:10] can with you know you've gone through
[2:04:12] gra but let us allow us to say something
[2:04:15] friends well people will speak but
[2:04:18] always be careful who you are listening
[2:04:20] to.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I Amen hallelujah when I
[2:04:25] receive this message I close my ears
[2:04:27] from all other speakers. Why? Because I
[2:04:30] found life in this message.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But he said, "Who can
[2:04:34] withhold himself from speaking?" And so,
[2:04:37] you know, and you know, when they
[2:04:39] started speaking, they never spoke life
[2:04:41] into Job. And and and and you know, uh
[2:04:44] Edifa started saying, "Who whoever
[2:04:47] perished being innocent, you know, is is
[2:04:49] like telling Job, you are not innocent.
[2:04:51] You're not innocent. You're guilty." You
[2:04:54] know, and then build that came up and
[2:04:56] Job 8 and he also started speaking and
[2:04:58] whatever he was speaking because of
[2:04:59] time, I not read you all the things, but
[2:05:01] you know, he said, "Job, you should
[2:05:02] repent. you a secret sinner. And Zofa
[2:05:05] comes up the number and also begins to
[2:05:07] speak and he tells him, you know what,
[2:05:11] Job, you are a liar. You are hiding
[2:05:13] something from us. How can God let you
[2:05:15] suffer this way? Oh, the three friends
[2:05:18] of Job have spoken. But that is not all.
[2:05:23] You know, no matter conditions sometimes
[2:05:25] happen in your life and people speak and
[2:05:27] you know uh situations and people speak
[2:05:30] and you hear voices and sometimes it may
[2:05:32] not even be people speaking. The devil
[2:05:34] might come and you know you know try to
[2:05:37] come in your mind and speak to you. But
[2:05:40] their speech did not comfort Job but
[2:05:42] instead made him embittered. It made him
[2:05:44] confused and made him self-righteous.
[2:05:47] Any speech that makes you embittered,
[2:05:49] self-righteous and or confused is not of
[2:05:52] God.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Job had almost lost his identity of who
[2:05:56] he is. And you know he was singing
[2:05:58] through a glass darkly after hearing all
[2:06:00] these speakers. Someone else had to
[2:06:02] speak friends even so more clearly to
[2:06:05] discern Job's heart and you know to
[2:06:07] remind Job of his true origin.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; Praise God. In the message, show us the
[2:06:14] father. It's a feist. Brother Bam says,
[2:06:16] "But notice when a man is hungering and
[2:06:19] thirsting for God, God will bring draw
[2:06:21] near to that man always.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Give up. Surrender your will to God."
[2:06:29] Then when his church members came and
[2:06:32] could not consult him, they accused him
[2:06:34] to being a sacred sin and said he would
[2:06:37] sin before God. Job knew he had not
[2:06:41] sinned. Job knew he knew he was all
[2:06:44] right. But then God sent a young man
[2:06:46] down by the name of Elu.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; You know my last my my my my my fourth
[2:06:52] child is called Elu. And when God gave
[2:06:54] me this and this will shock some of you.
[2:06:57] When God gave me this child, you know,
[2:06:59] he spoke to me. He said that I'll come
[2:07:01] to this church and I will speak on this
[2:07:03] subject after all have spoken. And
[2:07:06] that's many years ago. And so this boy
[2:07:09] came and his name was Elu. Came down to
[2:07:11] meet Job and perfect type of Christ
[2:07:13] again. And brother Bham calls Jo a
[2:07:15] perfect type of Christ. And in another
[2:07:17] place he says that he was a messenger of
[2:07:18] God. He didn't accuse Job of being a
[2:07:21] secret sinner. He tried to tell him of
[2:07:23] someone who would come and stand in the
[2:07:25] bridge in the last days to put his hands
[2:07:27] upon a sinful man and upon a holy God
[2:07:30] and to bridge the way. This was the
[2:07:32] message of Elu. Amen.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; Now let's look at Eloo for just a
[2:07:36] moment. Now Elu had waited till Job had
[2:07:38] spoken because they were elder than he.
[2:07:41] Eloo was just a young man. Amen. When
[2:07:43] Eloo saw that there was no answer in the
[2:07:45] mouth of these three men. When his wrath
[2:07:48] was then his wrath was kindled. Amen. Be
[2:07:51] behold I waited for your words. I gave
[2:07:53] ear to your reasons while ye searched
[2:07:56] out what to say. Yeah, this is El
[2:07:58] speaking. I attended unto you and behold
[2:08:01] there was none of you that convinced
[2:08:04] Job. And the word there convinced in
[2:08:07] Hebrew is is yakash which means to prove
[2:08:10] which means to convict. What all these
[2:08:13] other people spoke did not convict Job.
[2:08:17] Amen. All that answered his words and he
[2:08:19] says now he has not directed his words
[2:08:23] against me neither will I answer him
[2:08:26] with your speeches. Now he says I'm
[2:08:28] going to answer you Elu but I'm not
[2:08:31] going to rather Job but I'm not going to
[2:08:33] answer Job with using the speeches of of
[2:08:36] these other three people the friends of
[2:08:38] Job but I'm going he says they were
[2:08:41] amazed they answered no more they left
[2:08:44] off speaking behold my belly is as wine
[2:08:47] which has no vent it is ready to bust
[2:08:50] like new bottles. This is Elu describing
[2:08:52] himself. I will speak that I may be
[2:08:55] refreshed. I will open my lips and I
[2:08:57] will answer. Now when you see what all
[2:09:00] the others spoke, if you read the book
[2:09:02] of Job and you really read closely to
[2:09:04] see what all the others spoke, they were
[2:09:06] speaking presumption. They didn't know
[2:09:07] what they were talking about. They were
[2:09:08] just presuming everything. They they did
[2:09:11] not have uh a thus sayeth the Lord. But
[2:09:14] when came down, he was not speaking
[2:09:16] presumptuously. He knew what he was
[2:09:19] talking about. Amen. Have we not got a
[2:09:22] man of God in our generation who knows
[2:09:24] what he's talking about?
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; I've had people who say that uh you know
[2:09:29] brother Bham went and uh you know plized
[2:09:33] you know so and so's work and so and
[2:09:34] so's work and that's that's why I left
[2:09:37] the message. They don't understand
[2:09:38] friends that brother Bham actually
[2:09:41] himself says that he read all these
[2:09:43] works and he was always there when
[2:09:46] everybody was speaking
[2:09:48] but when he started to speak he said I
[2:09:51] am using none of your works.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he knew he had a thus
[2:09:56] sayeth the Lord.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He says in my belly is as
[2:10:01] wine. Amen. Is as wine. And it was words
[2:10:04] was more than just his opinions. They
[2:10:07] were not just educated guesses.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; His words had the power. It had the
[2:10:13] strength. It had the intensity to pierce
[2:10:16] through the heart of Job and cause an
[2:10:19] answer
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; that reproved him and convicted his
[2:10:23] heart.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; Remember when you came to the message,
[2:10:27] why are you here? You were convicted.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; You heard something that convinced and
[2:10:32] convicted you.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Praise God. This was more than just a
[2:10:37] man. It was Christ in a man. Amen. It
[2:10:41] was God reaching out to Job after all
[2:10:43] had spoken.
[2:10:45] These words came out of the abundance of
[2:10:47] revelation given to Elwood. It is sure
[2:10:49] you know caused it must have caused that
[2:10:52] stimulation of revelation. You know as
[2:10:54] Job said that you know my Bailey is
[2:10:57] bubbling up as wine. You know Job was
[2:11:00] speak was speaking out of the abundance
[2:11:02] of the revelation that he had within
[2:11:05] him. It was more than words. It was the
[2:11:08] word of God. It was God himself. I don't
[2:11:13] know whether you see where I am going.
[2:11:14] In Job 33 1, it says, "Wherefore Job, I
[2:11:17] pray thee, hear my speeches." Now this
[2:11:20] is Elu speaking. Hear my speeches and
[2:11:23] hecken to all my words. Behold, now I
[2:11:25] have opened my mouth, and my tongue has
[2:11:28] spoken in my mouth. My word shall be of
[2:11:30] the uprightness of my heart, and my lips
[2:11:32] shall utter knowledge clearly. Amen.
[2:11:35] Clearly, not darkly, but clearly.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God has made me, and the
[2:11:41] breath of the Almighty has given me
[2:11:43] life. And if thou canst answer me, set
[2:11:45] thy words in order before me. Stand up.
[2:11:49] I love the way Elu was speaking with
[2:11:51] authority. Stand up. Behold, I am
[2:11:54] according uh to thy wish in God is
[2:11:57] stead.
[2:11:59] I'm also formed out of the clay. When a
[2:12:02] spoke,
[2:12:04] this is what Job had. And I pinned down
[2:12:06] a few words here. Listen, this is what
[2:12:08] Job heard. And if you ever heard
[2:12:10] anything like that, you of your
[2:12:12] generation spoke, you say amen to those
[2:12:15] words.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; This is what Job had. He had come on
[2:12:18] elect. He said, "Stand up." Say, "Come
[2:12:20] on, elect of God. Stand up and leave the
[2:12:23] ash heap."
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Weep no more, for the lion of the tribe
[2:12:28] of Judah has prevailed. Amen. Beautiful
[2:12:31] ashes and the oil of joyful morning. The
[2:12:34] garment of praise for the spirit of
[2:12:36] heaviness. You are a tree of
[2:12:39] righteousness. This is what Job had.
[2:12:41] This is what I heard when I heard this
[2:12:43] message of the hour. The planting of the
[2:12:45] Lord and the purpose is God is being
[2:12:49] glorified in you. Job,
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; God is being glorified in me.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; And you also proceeded
[2:12:58] and said, "Suffer me a little. I will
[2:13:01] show thee that I have to speak."
[2:13:04] These words are very straight. I'll have
[2:13:07] to speak on God's behalf.
[2:13:10] I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and
[2:13:12] I will ascribe righteousness to my
[2:13:13] maker. For truly my words
[2:13:17] shall not be false. He that is perfect
[2:13:20] in knowledge is with thee.
[2:13:25] When El was speaking, he knew what he
[2:13:28] was talking about.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; It was something that he knew that he
[2:13:34] was speaking on God's behalf. He didn't
[2:13:36] miss his words when he said that.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:40] You remember the
[2:13:43] you might have heard this before in the
[2:13:45] message looking at the unseen.
[2:13:47] Brother Bham as he was speaking
[2:13:50] then just God comes and takes over.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; And then he begin speaking those words.
[2:13:55] You need to go and listen to that. It
[2:13:57] just is just so nice to hear. He says is
[2:14:00] he partating to you? He says I am the
[2:14:03] Lord that raised up Christ from the
[2:14:04] grave. I'm the one that sent the Holy
[2:14:06] Ghost. I'm the one that gave the
[2:14:08] promise. Brother Brham has nothing to do
[2:14:10] with this. He surrendered his life to
[2:14:11] me. I'm using his spirit. I'm talking
[2:14:13] through his lips. That's me. I'm the
[2:14:14] Lord.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; Now, if anybody wants to speak anything
[2:14:18] against Brother, he should know he's
[2:14:21] speaking against the Lord.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. El was speaking on behalf of
[2:14:29] God.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was not Elu speaking. It was
[2:14:33] God speaking to Job, reminding him who
[2:14:35] he truly is.
[2:14:38] Oh, the Oh, that one would hear me.
[2:14:42] Behold, my desire is that the Almighty
[2:14:45] would answer me and that my adversary
[2:14:48] had written a book. Now, this was Job's
[2:14:52] appeal,
[2:14:53] that all one would hear me. My desire is
[2:14:58] that the Almighty would answer me.
[2:15:02] Job had a desire for an answer. He had a
[2:15:05] desire within him for something other
[2:15:08] than what he had already heard.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; And that's what brother Bham prayed for
[2:15:19] in the everpresent water from the rock.
[2:15:21] He says, "We have not come and gathered
[2:15:23] under this hot uh hot roof today." Well,
[2:15:25] it's not a hot roof today here, but it
[2:15:28] says just to be seen. But we have come
[2:15:30] here because we love you.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; And you know, thank God if you have a
[2:15:36] place where you can worship the Lord.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, Clo, just
[2:15:41] especially the young people here, you
[2:15:43] have a responsibility.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; God has placed you here not for nothing
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; but for a purpose.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; You have to run with this message.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; And brother Bam says that uh you know,
[2:15:56] he's placed us on this hot roof today.
[2:15:59] And at that time they had a hot roof.
[2:16:02] We've been to places in Karamoja where
[2:16:04] people just sit
[2:16:06] under a tree, huge tree, maybe 500
[2:16:08] people or so and you have to preach to
[2:16:09] them and or maybe places where you have
[2:16:11] no roof,
[2:16:14] you know, and but if you are given a
[2:16:17] great opportunity to be a part of a work
[2:16:20] that God is doing, he has a purpose. You
[2:16:22] have to run with what you have. It says
[2:16:25] we have come here because we love you.
[2:16:28] Because we are desiring to hear from
[2:16:30] you. You are our lover that we love and
[2:16:32] we desire to hear the words from thee.
[2:16:35] We are grateful for what we have already
[2:16:36] heard. It will long stay with us. Now
[2:16:39] give us the portion
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; that you have for us today as we wait
[2:16:43] father on thee. Let me tell you this
[2:16:46] message.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; Help me Lord.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; This message did not stop with brother
[2:16:52] Brham. Amen.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; When brother Bham died, many people
[2:16:56] thought that the message was over.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; As we know that, oh God, there are many
[2:17:02] who actually left and others who waited
[2:17:05] for him to rise up again from the dead
[2:17:08] and when he never did, he walked away.
[2:17:10] And but there are those like brother Ed
[2:17:14] who caught the vision
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; and realized that this is not just a
[2:17:19] man,
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; is the message.
[2:17:23] And you know when brother Ed passes away
[2:17:26] and it breaks my heart that I was never
[2:17:28] able to meet him. But let me tell you
[2:17:31] friends I caught the vision.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; I knew that this is not about the man.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. We you here in Clo have to still
[2:17:41] run with this message.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's the you know God spoke
[2:17:47] yesterday but he must speak today also.
[2:17:49] God used others yesterday. But he must
[2:17:51] use others today also because he's the
[2:17:54] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; What he did before, he will do today and
[2:17:59] he will do tomorrow. He never changes.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; He has to give us our portion for this
[2:18:07] day. You know, in the message trial, he
[2:18:09] says, "I'm a stranger."
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; And there's one time, friends, when I I
[2:18:17] was listening
[2:18:20] Some of you may not maybe believe this,
[2:18:22] but you are believers, you'll believe
[2:18:23] it. And you know, I I was in my room, by
[2:18:27] the way, the preaching of brother Ed
[2:18:29] increased my intestine love for the
[2:18:31] message to listen to brother Bham. And
[2:18:33] so one time I was in my little bedroom
[2:18:36] and on the table and I had my laptop and
[2:18:38] I was listening to brother Bham speaking
[2:18:40] and and I I had a problem. I had a
[2:18:44] stomach trouble and I I was confused. I
[2:18:46] didn't know what was going on in my life
[2:18:48] at the time and I was already a minister
[2:18:50] of the gospel at the time. I I was still
[2:18:51] young of course and little I'm still
[2:18:53] young now but I was very little then and
[2:18:55] then you know I started listening I
[2:18:57] listened from the beginning of the tape
[2:18:59] up to the end and at the end then by the
[2:19:01] banner begins you know to I love that's
[2:19:03] a special part of my of the service you
[2:19:05] know those discernments and I started
[2:19:07] listening to one by one and I somehow a
[2:19:11] strange faith came to me to believe that
[2:19:14] I would be called to and I I just was
[2:19:19] under expectation that I would be called
[2:19:20] True. And at that moment, you know,
[2:19:23] brother Bam called the first person. Ah,
[2:19:25] it's not me. Ah, it's not. But I kept on
[2:19:26] believing I'm the next. I'm the next.
[2:19:29] And then
[2:19:31] and then friends. He said, "Come here,
[2:19:34] sir." I said, "I'm the one." He said,
[2:19:37] "You are a minister."
[2:19:40] I knew that that was true. I was a
[2:19:41] minister. He said, "You have stomach
[2:19:43] trouble, friends." I I I just saw the
[2:19:44] shouting and you know, he he explained
[2:19:48] the cause of the trouble. And when I
[2:19:49] looked through my life, I realized it
[2:19:51] was the cause. And then he prayed. He
[2:19:53] said, "It's gone." And it was gone right
[2:19:55] away.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I tell you friends, we have a
[2:20:00] living message. It's not just a message
[2:20:03] of yesterday. It's a message of today
[2:20:04] also. Amen. Why? Because Elu, our
[2:20:08] prophet, messenger paves a way for God
[2:20:10] to come and speak the answer that our
[2:20:13] hearts are so yearning for.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, brother Bam then in me
[2:20:18] trial. He says, "I'm a stranger. I'm
[2:20:20] only bearing record of what the Bible
[2:20:22] says to be the truth. If you notice, the
[2:20:24] angel of the Lord had come in the form
[2:20:26] of a man, had his back turned to the
[2:20:29] tent, and he told Abraham what Sarah was
[2:20:31] thinking." Jesus said it would be it
[2:20:34] would repeat. Now, if I have told you
[2:20:36] the truth, and this is my favorite
[2:20:38] portion of the sermons, he says, "If
[2:20:41] I've told you the truth, let God confirm
[2:20:44] that to be the truth.
[2:20:46] Let him reveal it. Then it's no secret
[2:20:48] we know. Then I I'll leave this
[2:20:51] afternoon with this verdict to make your
[2:20:53] to make in your own mind. Let God
[2:20:57] uh that made the promise. Not back in
[2:21:00] them days they were vindicated. Let the
[2:21:03] God that made the promise vindicate it
[2:21:06] today say the same. Some of you think in
[2:21:10] your heart, pray to God for your
[2:21:12] sickness or your affliction and see if
[2:21:14] God will reveal the secret of the heart.
[2:21:15] I challenge you to do it from one side
[2:21:18] to the other. Now, would I dare to do a
[2:21:20] thing like that if I wasn't standing
[2:21:22] exactly on what the scripture says?
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; Doesn't he speak like El?
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; He knew what he was talking about.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; So, I'm speaking on God's behalf.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; That's what he was saying. I want this
[2:21:35] court to see that it's the same
[2:21:37] yesterday, today, and forever. And he
[2:21:39] keeps his promise. And he promised that
[2:21:41] Jesus Christ would be revealed in the
[2:21:43] last days as a son of man. And then
[2:21:45] right after that
[2:21:48] begins to say, "A man sitting here
[2:21:51] whenever I begin hearing that friends,
[2:21:53] my heart begin to quiver.
[2:21:56] Suffering with hemorrhoids. I never seen
[2:21:58] you in my life. If that's right, raise
[2:22:00] up your hand. You believe me to give
[2:22:02] witness of the word of God? That's your
[2:22:05] wife sitting next to you. She's
[2:22:07] suffering also sits on her head. That's
[2:22:09] right. Raise up your hand. Do you
[2:22:10] believe God can tell me who you are? If
[2:22:12] you steal the word, the word knows the
[2:22:15] secret of the heart.
[2:22:18] And then he says, "You are Mr. and Mrs.
[2:22:20] Hunt." If that's right, raise up your
[2:22:21] hand. Why don't you believe?
[2:22:24] You know, here sits a man sitting right
[2:22:26] here, his head down, crying, praying for
[2:22:28] himself and also for his wife. she she
[2:22:30] isn't here. And you know, it carries on
[2:22:32] and on and on. And if I had a time, I
[2:22:34] would read you all that. It's just so
[2:22:36] beautiful to see, you know, God
[2:22:38] designing those people's hearts. But I
[2:22:40] will tell you what, it's the same thing
[2:22:41] that happened when El came to Job. It
[2:22:44] looked like El's heart was being
[2:22:45] discerned.
[2:22:47] And it's the same thing that happened to
[2:22:48] us when we heard the word.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; Elu spoke nothing but the word. He was a
[2:22:52] forerunner of the coming of the coming
[2:22:56] word.
[2:22:57] The spoken word is the original seed.
[2:22:59] How many love that message? Amen. It
[2:23:01] says brother Bam declared his mission.
[2:23:05] And he said my mission
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; that I believe that God has called me
[2:23:10] for. I have to say some personal things
[2:23:12] today because that's what I I told you I
[2:23:15] would do and tell the world.
[2:23:18] My mission I believe to the earth is to
[2:23:21] forun the coming word
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; and see the coming word which is Christ
[2:23:28] and Christ and Christ in him has the
[2:23:32] millennium and has everything right
[2:23:34] there because he is the word
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; that's right
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; after Elu came after Elu comes the word
[2:23:44] shows up
[2:23:45] and you know when El came, he spoke
[2:23:49] ordered. He spoke and you know, you can
[2:23:51] go and and study and and see and see the
[2:23:55] the the amount of words that Elu spoke
[2:23:57] to uh to both the other people that were
[2:24:00] speaking unto Elu as well um to Job as
[2:24:02] well. But you you you see then Job 38
[2:24:06] now gives
[2:24:09] another words or other words from the
[2:24:11] Lord himself after Elu had spoken. And
[2:24:14] the Lord answered Job out of the
[2:24:16] whirlwind and said, you know, you notice
[2:24:18] that God did not come after builder had
[2:24:20] spoken. God did not come after, you
[2:24:23] know, one of these uh people had spoken.
[2:24:26] He waited it out until the messenger,
[2:24:28] the true witness had spoken
[2:24:32] and said, Who is that? Who is this that
[2:24:34] darkene counsel by words without
[2:24:36] knowledge? Guard up now thy loyans like
[2:24:38] a man. For I will demand of thee and
[2:24:40] answer thou me, where was thou when I
[2:24:42] laid the foundation of the of the earth?
[2:24:44] Declare if thou hast understanding.
[2:24:47] Amen. Praise God.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; Where was thou? Where was thou?
[2:24:53] Spiritual amnesia is a very good
[2:24:55] message. Brother Banam takes that and
[2:24:57] you know I'll try to see if I can take
[2:25:00] you through some of it. It says
[2:25:05] you have to be the same. We don't want
[2:25:06] to forget that all that he was, I'm
[2:25:09] identified with him. I'm identified with
[2:25:13] him.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; He is in me and I am in him. Every
[2:25:18] Christian that's a real genuine
[2:25:19] Christian was with him. When the morning
[2:25:22] stars sung together and the sons of God
[2:25:24] shouted for joy before there was a
[2:25:25] foundation of the world, we were
[2:25:27] identified in the immortal realms with
[2:25:30] God 10 million years before the world
[2:25:33] was ever formed. I was back there with
[2:25:35] him. If I if I got eternal life, I I I
[2:25:38] was there with him. I was identified
[2:25:40] with him. When a morning star son
[2:25:42] together and the sons of God shouted for
[2:25:44] joy,
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; I was there, too. You were there.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; You were there.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. You were there. I was with you,
[2:25:52] Brother Tom. Amen. I was with you.
[2:25:54] Hallelujah. We were there with him. We
[2:25:57] were in his mind before the foundation
[2:25:59] of the world. I didn't just come from
[2:26:01] the blue.
[2:26:03] I didn't just appear from somewhere. I
[2:26:06] was in his mind. Amen. Hallelujah. And
[2:26:09] I've been spoken into existence by the
[2:26:12] spoken word in this generation.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And let me tell you, if the
[2:26:16] devil thinks that this is a joke, a let
[2:26:19] him wash us.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; This is the bride that cannot fall.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We are here to be manifested
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; in this last age to prove to the devil.
[2:26:31] Amen. That we came from God and we go
[2:26:34] back to God.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You know what? This all
[2:26:38] comes to view after a has come.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; Some of you that were in the
[2:26:45] denominations, you know, you never
[2:26:47] actually just always boggled down. You
[2:26:49] never knew who you are. But this message
[2:26:53] just brought your identity
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; into full view.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we know who we are. Now we
[2:27:00] know we are the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:27:01] We are not some denomination you know
[2:27:03] lost somewhere. We know who we are,
[2:27:05] where we came from, where we are going
[2:27:07] and we are living as sons and daughters
[2:27:09] of the king. Let me it doesn't matter
[2:27:11] where you you you are from or where you
[2:27:13] you come from or where you live. You
[2:27:15] might live here in in Canada. I might
[2:27:19] live there in Uganda, but let me tell
[2:27:22] you, we all came from the same place and
[2:27:24] we are going to go back to the same
[2:27:26] place because we came from the mind of
[2:27:28] God. And you know what has brought us
[2:27:29] into manifestation? The word of the
[2:27:31] hour.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. He for the coming word. And he
[2:27:36] says, I was with him when he called
[2:27:38] Abraham at the age of 75 and his wife at
[2:27:41] the age of 65 and told him they were
[2:27:43] going to have a baby. I was with him
[2:27:44] when he took his hand upon that sayith
[2:27:47] the Lord. I'm going to have a baby. I
[2:27:48] stood with him. Every other Christian
[2:27:50] stood with him. I was with him when his
[2:27:53] temp temptations come. I was with him
[2:27:56] when he went up on the top of the
[2:27:58] mountain to offer up Isaac. I was with
[2:28:01] him when the ram appeared.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; I was with him when he went up. Amen.
[2:28:08] When he took Isaac to go and offer when
[2:28:10] it took Abraham to go and over Isaac.
[2:28:12] You know what?
[2:28:14] That that's quite a sin. And I always
[2:28:16] envision it in my mind and I try to
[2:28:19] apply to my life today. Abraham was a
[2:28:21] man of faith. But you see I was with him
[2:28:24] when that was happening.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; And as he goes, he has told nobody and
[2:28:27] they're all going and you know he's
[2:28:29] going up the mountain by faith following
[2:28:32] the promise and you know just believing
[2:28:34] that what God said in his word and he
[2:28:37] reached somewhere
[2:28:39] and and and told his servants stay with
[2:28:42] the donkeys.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; Stay with the donkeys. I and the lad are
[2:28:45] going up the mountain to worship. Not
[2:28:48] everybody can go to the mountain of
[2:28:50] worship.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; Let our worshippers arise, brother Ryan.
[2:28:54] God bless you. Amen. Let our worshippers
[2:28:56] arise. We are the worshippers in this
[2:28:58] day.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And but you know there are many
[2:29:01] people who are going back or who are
[2:29:03] staying with the donkeys. Staying with
[2:29:05] the donkeys of religion and donkeys of
[2:29:07] indifference and donkeys of why I left
[2:29:10] the message and donkeys of that. I said
[2:29:12] let them stay with our donkeys. Amen.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm here on the mountain of
[2:29:16] revelation of the word to worship the
[2:29:18] Lord. Amen. No one can take this message
[2:29:22] away from me. Do you know why? Because
[2:29:24] it is my sacred trust. It has been
[2:29:27] entrusted to me and I'm going to leave
[2:29:29] it. I'm going to preach it. I'm going to
[2:29:31] leave it. I'm going to preach it. Why?
[2:29:32] Because I am a part of this revealed
[2:29:35] word of this day.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't just believe the message.
[2:29:39] I'm a part of the message. So when
[2:29:41] someone says I left the message, it
[2:29:43] means they were never a part of it.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; They intellectually received it but they
[2:29:48] never a part of it. You cannot leave
[2:29:50] something that you are a part of. You
[2:29:52] cannot leave you.
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; I was with Joseph when he was rejected
[2:29:57] by his brethren. I was with Jacob and
[2:29:59] you know brother Bam keeps on saying all
[2:30:01] that. Job had gotten a little spiritual
[2:30:03] amnesia
[2:30:05] because of his situation and listening
[2:30:07] to those
[2:30:10] not sent to speak. But after all had
[2:30:13] spoken, after all had spoken, then God
[2:30:17] sent Elu.
[2:30:19] A prophet of God vindicated to speak on
[2:30:21] God's behalf. I'll give you this
[2:30:23] testimony as I'm about to finish.
[2:30:25] friends. One time I uh as in the process
[2:30:28] of preaching to me, one brother told me
[2:30:30] because I told him, "Well, I'll go and
[2:30:32] ask the bishop when it came to water
[2:30:34] baptism." So, I went to ask the bishop
[2:30:38] and uh the bishop told me, "Do you have
[2:30:40] the prayer book?" Cuz I my question to
[2:30:42] him was, "Uh, bishop, is it true that
[2:30:45] someone must be immersed in water and in
[2:30:48] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, not
[2:30:49] father, son, and holy spirit?"
[2:30:51] And he said, "Do you have He said he
[2:30:53] said, "Do you have the prayer book?" How
[2:30:55] many know the prayer book?
[2:30:58] Oh, God bless you.
[2:31:01] Amen. He understands what I'm talking
[2:31:03] about. A prayer book is a a book with a
[2:31:06] bunch of creeds and dogmas
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; that people live off from. I'm so glad
[2:31:12] that we are not living off of that.
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; We have the body word of the son of man.
[2:31:18] And you know, he said, "Do you have a
[2:31:19] prayer book?" I said no. He said oh no
[2:31:22] my son you should have the prayer book.
[2:31:25] It has most of the pillars of our
[2:31:26] church. And then he sent for it. And so
[2:31:28] he read for me a portion which said um
[2:31:32] then they will take the child or the
[2:31:35] adult and baptize them either by
[2:31:37] immersion or by sprinkling and uh in the
[2:31:40] name of the father, son and holy spirit.
[2:31:42] So I came back excited not because the
[2:31:44] name is correct but because that they
[2:31:46] can also immerse even if it's just an
[2:31:48] option. So I came back and told uh the
[2:31:51] the preacher who was preaching to me. I
[2:31:53] told him look my bishop said I can also
[2:31:56] be baptized
[2:31:58] by imagine and he looked at me and he
[2:32:00] said do you think your bishop with his
[2:32:04] gowns can actually go down the water the
[2:32:06] and baptize you?
[2:32:09] He he offended me. I actually cried. I
[2:32:13] shed tears because I loved my bishop and
[2:32:15] what the bishop had spoken was like God
[2:32:17] speaking to me but I did not know that I
[2:32:19] was lost friends go I I had I was
[2:32:23] listening to those that were not sent to
[2:32:25] speak to me.
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. But friends I I am an elect.
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You you know the devil might have
[2:32:34] buried some of us somewhere but he did
[2:32:36] not know that we were seed. You cannot
[2:32:38] bury seed forever. When you bury seed
[2:32:40] what happens? It has to grow. It has to
[2:32:42] come out. Amen. We're buried in
[2:32:44] denominations. But you know what? When
[2:32:46] we heard Elijah speak, good evening,
[2:32:48] friends. Good morning, friends. You know
[2:32:50] what? We heard a of our generation
[2:32:52] speaking.
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; He was speaking on behalf of God. And
[2:32:56] Amen. And that rose up us out of that
[2:32:59] situation. And after all had spoken, God
[2:33:02] sent Elu, a prophet of God, a vindicated
[2:33:04] um you know, vindicated to speak on
[2:33:06] God's behalf. This reminds Job of his
[2:33:08] true identity in Christ.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. This has God
[2:33:13] uh God has sent us also in our day a
[2:33:15] prophet.
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; We all need not to say amen. We need to
[2:33:20] shout amen to that.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; God has sent us a prophet in our
[2:33:24] generation.
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; And he has spoken to us everything
[2:33:29] concerning our life. Whenever we feed on
[2:33:32] this word, we find out that we are a
[2:33:34] part of him.
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are we are the bride of his
[2:33:38] word. We are a part of him. You know,
[2:33:40] brother Bham says in the in the rising
[2:33:42] of the sun, he says she is him.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not just believing
[2:33:48] something, a doctrine. This message is
[2:33:50] more than a doctrine. Amen. It's just
[2:33:53] something that reveals and unveils your
[2:33:56] identity.
[2:33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:57] &gt;&gt; In Christ. After all have spoken, we can
[2:34:00] now finally say we have heard his voice
[2:34:04] &gt;&gt; and we have responded.
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; We have responded. Turn to Ephesians 1.
[2:34:10] It's the last scripture I will read
[2:34:11] tonight.
[2:34:13] Blessed be the God verse three of the
[2:34:16] father and the father of our Lord Jesus
[2:34:17] Christ who has blessed us with all
[2:34:19] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[2:34:21] in Christ according as he has chosen us
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; in him. Oh my, I wish we can read verses
[2:34:27] four together. Amen. Can we have it on
[2:34:30] the screen and read it together please?
[2:34:32] This is powerful.
[2:34:40] Ephesians 1. Yeah, right over there. Let
[2:34:44] us read it together if if you can. Amen.
[2:34:47] As a declaration, verses four. According
[2:34:50] as he has chosen us in him before the
[2:34:54] foundation of the world, that we should
[2:34:56] be holy and without blame before him in
[2:34:59] love. Vers five, having predestinated us
[2:35:04] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[2:35:08] Christ to himself according to the good
[2:35:11] pleasure of his will to the praise of
[2:35:14] the glory of his grace wherein he has
[2:35:16] made us accepted in the beloved. I would
[2:35:20] not be denied. Why? Because I've already
[2:35:22] been accepted in the beloved. This is
[2:35:25] what the message has unveiled for me.
[2:35:27] Now I know who I am. Amen.
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Pastor Tom, I came to inform the
[2:35:32] people. Amen. Because of this message,
[2:35:34] now I know who I am.
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't mind my shouting. It's
[2:35:39] because now I realize who I am. Imagine
[2:35:42] if you were told you are poor. You You
[2:35:44] have no heritage. You came from nowhere.
[2:35:46] And then all all of the sudden you
[2:35:48] realize you're a son of the king.
[2:35:49] Hallelujah. Now I know who I am.
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I was in him before my
[2:35:56] problems. I will be in him after all my
[2:35:59] problems.
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; My troubles in this world do not define
[2:36:03] me.
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; The word declares who I am and this is
[2:36:07] my identity.
[2:36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Through it all, I have learned to
[2:36:11] know it is all working for my good.
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. No, the devil will not take any
[2:36:20] credit.
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say that in your heart?
[2:36:23] The devil will not take any credit.
[2:36:26] Sometimes you like giving the devil
[2:36:28] credit to what is
[2:36:30] happening in our life. Excuse me.
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; We should not give the devil any credit.
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; If you're going through a bad time,
[2:36:37] don't give the devil any credit.
[2:36:39] Whatever is happening is happening for
[2:36:41] your good. I will praise God for
[2:36:43] everything in my life. Amen. I'll praise
[2:36:46] him for my success and I'll praise him
[2:36:49] for my failures too.
[2:36:51] I'll praise him in my health and I will
[2:36:54] also praise him in my sickness too.
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll praise him, Amen, for the
[2:36:59] strength that he has given me. But also
[2:37:01] I'll praise him for the weaknesses.
[2:37:03] Amen. I'll praise him in good times.
[2:37:05] &gt;&gt; And I'll praise him in what?
[2:37:07] &gt;&gt; In bad times.
[2:37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll praise him when I can figure
[2:37:11] it out. How many of you have something
[2:37:13] you can't figure out? But I also praise
[2:37:15] him when I have something I can't figure
[2:37:16] out. Amen. When things are hard, you
[2:37:19] know the devil always likes speaking.
[2:37:21] And many of you, you open your ears to
[2:37:24] the devil, he speaks to you, this, he
[2:37:25] speaks. So, I will not even go to
[2:37:27] church. I won't even go to church. I
[2:37:29] will not, you know why? Because the
[2:37:31] devil has spoken to you.
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; There are many people who are supposed
[2:37:34] to even be here this Sunday morning.
[2:37:36] They didn't show up. Why? Because they
[2:37:37] listened to the devil.
[2:37:39] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, you are here
[2:37:40] because you did not listen.
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let them speak. But after all are
[2:37:47] spoken, remember God also has spoken to
[2:37:49] you in this generation with a word
[2:37:51] unfailing word.
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. When things are hard, the devil
[2:37:56] likes speaking when we lose, you know,
[2:37:59] people that we love so dear.
[2:38:04] I know many have spoken and brother Ed
[2:38:07] was
[2:38:10] a mentor to so many but to me
[2:38:15] brother Victor may come close to
[2:38:17] understand that but
[2:38:20] you know
[2:38:24] not when you are going to get anything
[2:38:26] from the person as in material
[2:38:29] but is somebody that helped me
[2:38:33] to find my identity.
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; It redefined what my ambitions were. I
[2:38:42] wanted to be a bishop and then I
[2:38:45] realized there's something better.
[2:38:48] &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God. Amen.
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, church,
[2:38:57] you here at Clovar are not the ones, the
[2:38:59] only ones that have lost
[2:39:02] when you lost Brother Bisca.
[2:39:05] We too
[2:39:07] I represent very many, many of them.
[2:39:10] You'll never get to know them.
[2:39:13] But I tell you what, when we lose a
[2:39:16] mental father and brother Tim preached a
[2:39:18] masterpiece, we listen to it.
[2:39:22] Spiritual guide, the devil at that time
[2:39:26] likes to speak.
[2:39:28] But as I was studying and as I'm
[2:39:30] approaching to just finish,
[2:39:33] I just felt the Holy Spirit move on on
[2:39:36] my heart and I started writing these
[2:39:38] words that I'm going to read to you now.
[2:39:43] I I speak unto you today
[2:39:46] after all the voices, after all have
[2:39:49] spoken, remember God has sent an Elhu to
[2:39:53] us in this generation with a message of
[2:39:58] shalom.
[2:40:00] &gt;&gt; An elu, a prophet that God sent to
[2:40:03] fulfill Malachi 4. This is a message
[2:40:08] that has showed us our identity.
[2:40:11] And I want to finish like this friends.
[2:40:15] God help me.
[2:40:17] This I know was the vision of brother
[2:40:20] Biscar.
[2:40:22] When brother Tom came to Uganda, Brother
[2:40:24] Michael and they they saw those
[2:40:27] ministers,
[2:40:29] you know, showing transcripts of books
[2:40:32] that they had handwritten. And I was
[2:40:35] just seated on the side and I watched
[2:40:37] Brother Mike. I watched brother Tom.
[2:40:41] It it was like brother Biscal was seated
[2:40:43] right before me there. You could see
[2:40:46] their heart going out to that. Why you
[2:40:50] think?
[2:40:53] Because of the voice
[2:40:56] because of this message. What is it? It
[2:41:00] is a word from our elu.
[2:41:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:41:03] &gt;&gt; Of our generation.
[2:41:06] And it is our vision. When I say our, I
[2:41:09] mean the bride's vision,
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; to send it out.
[2:41:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:13] &gt;&gt; And you know, I've made it a business of
[2:41:15] mine. When I came when I found this
[2:41:18] message, I decided to forget everything.
[2:41:20] There many things I could do. I have
[2:41:22] many talents in my life. But friends, I
[2:41:25] decided to make this my job.
[2:41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:29] &gt;&gt; To send the message out.
[2:41:33] And every day sometimes the devil comes
[2:41:35] and he speaks. He says give up. When
[2:41:37] especially things become tough. But when
[2:41:39] you look around you and you see how many
[2:41:41] lives are changed just by giving out
[2:41:43] this message. You know brother Michael
[2:41:45] preached that the message has a life of
[2:41:47] its own.
[2:41:49] &gt;&gt; We you know we don't need to help the
[2:41:51] message. You need to take the message
[2:41:53] and send it out.
[2:41:55] &gt;&gt; God has his own way of making sure that
[2:41:58] it finds that last one.
[2:42:02] And I I've always known, but when
[2:42:04] brother Michael took me around and I was
[2:42:06] able to see
[2:42:08] tapes and tapes and tapes and you know
[2:42:11] some deaths back Yes.
[2:42:14] I felt miserable. I felt like, oh God,
[2:42:16] what have I done in my generation? I've
[2:42:20] felt like I've done nothing.
[2:42:23] I felt like I've done nothing and I'm
[2:42:25] I'm going to leave CloDal Pastor Tom and
[2:42:28] go back to Uganda
[2:42:30] with a deeper vision and a deeper
[2:42:32] burden.
[2:42:33] &gt;&gt; I have to do it in my generation. I have
[2:42:36] to do something. But then I ask you
[2:42:40] as an individual, what are you going to
[2:42:42] do?
[2:42:44] &gt;&gt; What are we going to do?
[2:42:46] &gt;&gt; It is too late.
[2:42:48] Always remember, for thus sayaith the
[2:42:50] word,
[2:42:52] your latter end will be better
[2:42:55] than your beginning. That's how it was
[2:42:58] for Job
[2:42:59] &gt;&gt; and that's how it will be for us.
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:43:17] Hallelujah.
[2:43:32] Well, that was our Uganda week. Started
[2:43:35] last Sunday, Wednesday, and now Sunday.
[2:43:39] What can we do? What can we do? Well,
[2:43:43] we have a lot to do and doors are been
[2:43:46] opening for us and especially for uh the
[2:43:50] saints and the need and the burden and
[2:43:52] the cry. Look what the word has done in
[2:43:54] Uganda. Isn't that amazing to see?
[2:43:57] &gt;&gt; To God be the glory.
[2:43:59] &gt;&gt; It's not just in America. Brother Bra
[2:44:02] said, "America's burned over.
[2:44:04] &gt;&gt; You're just gleaning from here and
[2:44:06] you're gleaning from there." And and and
[2:44:08] and then you see what the the burden of
[2:44:11] the people are in in different areas
[2:44:14] within the Congo. I want to say to the
[2:44:17] Lord, I I just want to do my part at the
[2:44:20] end and closing of time.
[2:44:23] At the end and closing of time, can we
[2:44:26] help to see this gospel
[2:44:30] go to the ends of the earth circle back
[2:44:33] around into the Iraq people into Morocco
[2:44:37] and into Egypt and continue to support
[2:44:41] men of God such as Bazabosi,
[2:44:44] Brother Steven Ibali, Brother Freddy and
[2:44:46] the brothers that will carry this
[2:44:48] message throughout Uganda, saints in the
[2:44:50] Congo have I I I my mind has reeled
[2:44:54] really reeled over this last little
[2:44:56] while
[2:44:58] and I've been in the Congo three or four
[2:45:00] times and to see what God has done from
[2:45:02] nothing to make it what it is. It is not
[2:45:06] the works of man. It has always been the
[2:45:09] works of God.
[2:45:11] &gt;&gt; And that's why no man can raise up and
[2:45:13] say, "Well, look what I did." You know,
[2:45:15] at the end of the day, as I told you the
[2:45:17] other day, as I told you the other day,
[2:45:20] at the end of the day, when you've done
[2:45:22] all that you could do, it looks like you
[2:45:24] did nothing.
[2:45:26] And all we want to do is to do
[2:45:28] everything we can for the gospel of
[2:45:31] Jesus Christ. And we are by the grace of
[2:45:35] God as a church, we will continue with
[2:45:37] the radio broadcasts that are in in
[2:45:40] Uganda. We will continue that. Brother
[2:45:42] Michael could possibly be going over
[2:45:45] very soon setting up brother Fred. We're
[2:45:48] going over for youth camps for uh for
[2:45:51] brother Steve, brother Steven. And we're
[2:45:54] just going to do our part. We'll do our
[2:45:56] part and I know you'll do your part. And
[2:45:59] like I said, your prayers have meant so
[2:46:01] much to me and your giving has meant so
[2:46:04] much to to ourselves. And what the
[2:46:07] brothers and and everybody showed up the
[2:46:09] other night, 60 people for helping
[2:46:11] brother Darren. I was very proud, very
[2:46:14] proud of our people for that.
[2:46:17] I don't know what we can do. All I can
[2:46:20] All I know is that we have wonderful men
[2:46:22] of God. I look to the Lord for
[2:46:25] direction. If you feel to give towards
[2:46:28] missions this week, that would be fine.
[2:46:29] It will go towards missions in whatever
[2:46:32] capacity that we can send it forth.
[2:46:35] Brother Buzzaboosezi, you've blessed my
[2:46:37] heart. You've blessed my heart. I I was
[2:46:40] I was pretty much there when dad took
[2:46:42] your one of your first little texts and
[2:46:46] he turned to me. He says, "Well, we have
[2:46:48] a we have a couple of AAA's in our
[2:46:51] church." He says, "I think we got a
[2:46:53] quadruple A." And do you know what that
[2:46:56] means? A trip AAA.
[2:46:58] It's a battery. Some are A's, some are
[2:47:02] B's. You're quadruple.
[2:47:05] And so we've been blessed for that. And
[2:47:07] mama, I know you're here. I'm sure it
[2:47:09] thrills your heart. You've been wanting
[2:47:11] to see Brother Ed for so many years, and
[2:47:13] I'm sorry it failed to do that. But this
[2:47:17] meant more to me than anything, Brother
[2:47:19] Bus. You came because you have a love
[2:47:22] for the word, love for the church, and
[2:47:24] respect to the assembly. And God bless
[2:47:26] you for that. Well, God bless you. I
[2:47:30] trust you've been blessed.
[2:47:31] &gt;&gt; I bless you've been blessed. The word
[2:47:33] has gone over these many years. And if
[2:47:35] it's producing this kind of caliber, I
[2:47:38] think we should have a few people shout
[2:47:39] to the hilltops, "Praise be to God."
[2:47:43] This same message produces it around the
[2:47:47] world.
[2:47:49] Do you know what kind of peace that
[2:47:50] gives? It's not a brother Joe, you came
[2:47:53] out of the Hutterite community. Tell me
[2:47:55] how many Hutterite communities agreed
[2:47:56] with each other.
[2:47:58] Probably about zero,
[2:48:01] right? Whether you go, doesn't matter
[2:48:03] what community, but the bride is exactly
[2:48:07] the same.
[2:48:09] &gt;&gt; Stepping to the same beat
[2:48:11] &gt;&gt; of the gospel of Jesus Christ. And for
[2:48:15] that, I am thrilled.
[2:48:18] Now just play this very soft.
[2:48:34] &gt;&gt; Sitting in this assembly is heaven.
[2:48:40] I started to think, brother Bus, you're
[2:48:42] here all the way from Uganda.
[2:48:45] Sitting beside you is a man of God all
[2:48:47] the way from China.
[2:48:49] And sitting beside him is a man from
[2:48:52] Canada.
[2:48:55] So I just started to list
[2:48:58] and if I miss your country, please
[2:49:01] forgive me,
[2:49:03] but there are Canadians here. Why don't
[2:49:06] you stand?
[2:49:11] There are Americans here. Why don't you
[2:49:13] stand

[2:50:45] Now look around here. Look around this
[2:50:47] room.
[2:50:49] That is the taste of heaven.
[2:50:52] &gt;&gt; Why don't you give one another a hand?
[2:51:08] Some from every nation will be there.
[2:51:26] Heat. Heat.

[2:54:58] Yeah.
[2:55:04] Heat.
[2:55:14] Heat. Heat.
[2:55:31] Why don't you give yourself
[2:55:34] a warm clap
[2:55:46] when brother Random talked about he said
[2:55:48] when brother Neville was coming up
[2:55:51] he said brother Neville why don't you
[2:55:54] come on up Brother man, brother
[2:55:55] Brandham, you know, he didn't stand
[2:55:56] there.
[2:55:58] He says, "There goes Brother Neville.
[2:56:00] Brother Neville made it. Brother Neville
[2:56:02] made it. Brother Neville made it." He
[2:56:06] said, "Oh, I was so excited when I saw
[2:56:09] you, Darren, walk down those." I'm going
[2:56:11] to say, "Taran made it. Roxan made it."
[2:56:16] Come on. We can say one another, "Tim,
[2:56:18] you made it. It's worth it all. We made
[2:56:22] it.
[2:56:24] Amen. We're not going to stand there
[2:56:26] like, "What's going on?" The angels step
[2:56:29] aside. We're the redeemed. We're the
[2:56:33] blood wash. Were the purchase of God and
[2:56:36] we are going in.
[2:56:38] &gt;&gt; It's prophesied. I saw you there.
[2:56:44] &gt;&gt; He saw you there. He says, "You're not
[2:56:47] going to, oh, I hope I made it." He
[2:56:49] said, "You have already made it,
[2:56:52] precious. You've already made it. You
[2:56:55] will dance. You'll shout. You'll glorify
[2:56:58] God.
[2:57:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:57:04] &gt;&gt; I couldn't be with the most blessed
[2:57:07] people.
[2:57:09] God put you here for me.
[2:57:13] I've needed you
[2:57:15] to be a part of my body.
[2:57:20] We've needed one another.
[2:57:24] We did say, "Well, I'd rather be so and
[2:57:27] so." Well, God put you here. And you can
[2:57:30] be so carnal to say, "No, I just came
[2:57:32] here because I wanted to be here." Every
[2:57:35] decision we make, everything's planned
[2:57:37] by God. All things work to the good to
[2:57:39] them that love God. Brother Buzzabosi,
[2:57:44] you've made us proud.
[2:57:46] God bless you, my friend. Thank you for
[2:57:49] coming and making this day such a
[2:57:51] special day and feeling your heart over
[2:57:54] the next while you want to give for the
[2:57:57] work of God to go out in the distant
[2:58:00] lands.
[2:58:02] We have a missions for it.
[2:58:06] We're going to follow through for when a
[2:58:08] man of God started this church in and
[2:58:10] we're not stopping now.
[2:58:14] Why don't we bow our heads? Father
[2:58:19] strangely moved. Always have been
[2:58:21] strangely moved.
[2:58:26] We don't know Lord where our next breath
[2:58:28] comes from.
[2:58:31] But may we use that breath for the glory
[2:58:33] of God some way somehow. Days are
[2:58:36] passing quickly. Time is wrapping up.
[2:58:41] You're sending your ambassadors from
[2:58:43] around the world to stand behind our
[2:58:45] pulpit. We don't take it lightly, Lord.
[2:58:49] Brother Bruss's desire for many years
[2:58:51] has to been here in Cloverdale.
[2:58:54] And now you fulfilled the very desire of
[2:58:56] his heart.
[2:58:58] Scripture declares
[2:59:00] that I will grant to you the desire of
[2:59:03] your heart.
[2:59:05] Would you bless him?
[2:59:07] He's done much for the kingdom already.
[2:59:09] Lord, renew his vision, vigor, desire.
[2:59:15] He puts and coalates those message books
[2:59:18] to go around Uganda.
[2:59:21] Has influenced
[2:59:23] various areas.
[2:59:25] I pray God that he would cry
[2:59:28] with a loud voice himself. This glorious
[2:59:31] message is true.
[2:59:35] go with each and every one of us, Lord.
[2:59:37] It's been a strange week, but it's a
[2:59:39] week that we've dedicated to you.
[2:59:43] And pray, Lord, that our burdens and our
[2:59:45] hearts cry was to see this message go
[2:59:48] forth. Bless your people as they will
[2:59:51] give. And maybe not today, but maybe
[2:59:54] tomorrow.
[2:59:55] Many have asked, "What do we do?"
[2:59:58] I pray God you'll grant to them the
[3:00:01] direction that's needed as we commit the
[3:00:04] service to you
[3:00:06] in Jesus name. In Jesus name. Amen.
[3:00:12] Amen.
[3:00:15] Well, we've been called
[3:00:20] to fight.
[3:00:22] We've been called to fight. And I
[3:00:25] believe I'm going to fight for every one
[3:00:26] of our young people here.
[3:00:29] I'm not going to let the devil have you.
[3:00:33] Jordan, I'm sorry. You might as well
[3:00:35] just give you up your hands and say, "I
[3:00:37] surrender. I'm the Lord's."
[3:00:40] Joel's army is marching and she's going
[3:00:42] in victory
[3:00:44] and we're not giving up.
[3:00:48] Jo
[3:00:52] comes in you
[3:00:58] storm.
[3:01:12] Oh,
[3:01:21] heat,
[3:01:33] heat.
[3:01:37] Heat. Heat.
[3:01:54] Heat. Heat.
[3:02:04] Heat. Heat.
[3:02:24] Heat.
[3:02:27] Heat.
[3:02:36] Heat.
[3:02:39] Heat.
[3:03:05] Heat. Heat.
[3:03:12] I'm
[3:03:17] star
[3:03:27] crazy.
[3:03:43] to be free.
[3:03:47] Hallelujah.
[3:03:49] Well, remember next Sunday 4:30 is
[3:03:51] communion. I invite each and every one
[3:03:54] of you born again, filled with the Holy
[3:03:57] Ghost, baptized in Jesus Christ name.
[3:04:01] You're more than welcome to attend.
[3:04:03] We'll have our morning service as usual.
[3:04:04] 4:30 will be our evening service. It'll
[3:04:07] be communion. So, God bless you. Pray
[3:04:10] for us. Pray for Brother Bus. He's going
[3:04:13] to Toronto now to preach.
[3:04:15] Amen. We'll be praying for you, Brother
[3:04:17] Bus. And we'll stay in touch as you
[3:04:19] journey home. We love you much. Till we
[3:04:22] meet again. Can we sing an old song that
[3:04:25] I used to sing?
[3:04:28] Till we meet again.
[3:04:31] Till we meet. Greet one another. You're
[3:04:36] dismissed.
[3:04:37] Still
[3:04:44] heat.
[3:05:44] Heat.
[3:06:03] Heat.
[3:06:33] Oh,
[3:06:54] heat.
