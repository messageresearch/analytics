and Savior Jesus Christ can you also greet your neighbor tell them God bless you tell them welcome in the house of the Lord nice to see every one of you amen Amina we are going to open in the Book of Matthew chapter 16. together and while we open I have a few announcements for you I have an invitation letter here from restaurant Faith Tabernacles it says Freeman Joseph and Pastor biyanima Stephen invite you and you are charged to a three-day meeting that will start on 17th March up to 19th March the Lord has made it possible for Pastor Paul Baird from USA to come and be with us during this time I believe it will be a blessing and time of Awakening for the Bride of Jesus Christ we know all these pastors he had actually invited me to go and minister in his meetings but uh during that time we also had meetings here yeah is also not so far from us they have done um they are co-hosting I think Minister from the U.S and they would like us to go and participate in those meetings so this is and then down here they say days of the voice Fellowship so everybody's invited ever will be able to make it to those meetings that would be wonderful we shall maintain our Sunday service that day but I think there are other two days where you can be able to go and participate that is the weekend after next weekend weekend 17th to 19th if you want to write it and then uh next Sunday that is a Sunday our Sunday service Sunday Jam Services the Lord willing we shall have a friend Pastor Jesse Buddha to come and minister to us well I think it's from gayaza that's where their Fellowship is we're looking forward to another wonderful time I told you but suggested that I've had you interpret and it was wonderful I'm sure preaching will be something else amen and sister peace a pillow told me that she is in leader and should be there for a while and so she asked she said she's with us she streams most of the services and she asks for our prayers so with those announcements we can now go to the reading of the word uh Matthew chapter 16 Mateo is really most of the services my desire is to minister for one hour maybe because of the interpretation it can stretch up a little bit a few minutes after that so I usually request that you give me your undivided attention foreign not actually to me but to the word and I believe that the Lord will minister to your heart how men have come here expectant this morning amen I'm also expectant that the Lord will speak to you the musicians God bless you baby come and appreciate our musicians amen God bless you are most of them are learning but they're trying their best so we read now Matthew chapter 16 verses 24 to 26. and I'm reading in the name of the Lord then said then say Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me [Music] foreign will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man for what is a man propheted if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul [Music] amen Lord Jesus I'm going to speak to these people for a few minutes during this time I'm asking that you'll come and take me out of the way Lord I I have my abilities and I also have my insufficiencies can't help your people just ask that you'll come and use me this morning my dear brother Henry also because and father Lord may you help them also to yield themselves to find a place in their souls that only what you need for them to hear this morning will be spoken that's my desire this morning in Jesus name amen amen so this morning I I'd like once again to welcome you to church David said that I was happy when they said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord how many like David this morning are you happy to be in the house amen I am happy to be in the house well if you want me to preach to you this morning you have to respond then I will quickly go to the world and we will quickly hear from the Holy Spirit and and then we'll be out of here today this morning I'd like to speak on the kingdom without the cross once again the kingdom without the cross tell your neighbor the kingdom without the cross this is what we want to speak on this morning so now Jesus came to his disciples and said to them yes let him deny himself and follow me now in the commentary by Benson or Benson commentary mobile it's a Bible commentary commentary a YouTuber Benson you know he says if any man be willing to your moon so you know he says that if any man be willing meaning no one is forced it's just like a young man that wants to marry a young lady you cannot force marriage if you want to marry somebody you can force them tomorrow there has to be a willingness says that you see the young lady also makes her choice and decides to take on this young man and as a husband because it's only one decision that you make so in the same way Jesus said If any man will come after me yes it must be on the following terms it must be on the following times and I wanted to hear those times I'm going to list those terms for you so Jesus here in the Book of Matthew he lists for us times [Music] upon which if we want to follow him [Music] that we must adhere to journey following Jesus has times the repercussions to it and you don't just follow him if anybody could just follow Jesus Jesus would have been the greatest followed man on Earth today yes but there are many people who want to follow Jesus not so many people foreign [Music] [Music] are you hearing me this morning let him deny ing hurt him however we however pleasing it is and then you do the will of God the woman then you have to deny your will and do the will of God Amen Amina and then that brings the second the the second condition or the second term when he says and then the second one is you take up your cross praise the name of the Lord taking up your cross and carrying your cross is not easy jesus carried the cross yesterday but this cross was pointing to Calvary he was pointing to death because you know pointing to self-deniality but Jesus was willing to carry his cross foreign really carrying the cross and going through the pain Agony and suffering here on the dying yourself he's speaking on dying yourself in the message the water of Separation he says whether it is all other grounds is sinking Sun almost says it's an individual Affairs when you come to Jesus Christ if you want to be a follower of Jesus you must be willing to say on Christ alone I stand don't care when I lose this if I open I don't care whether I lose them I don't care whether I lose that I am willing and ready to carry my clothes and follow Jesus he says it's an individual Affair not of groups of people but it is a soul human being might notice might forsake your own thoughts in in witnessing this message to many people over the years I've often found that people find it easy to believe if others believe but when their friends are not believing the message it becomes very hard for them to believe it because they want that bandwagon effect and others believe because others I said let me open up if we can so we went to another one that we were not here because you're following somebody you are here because you are following Jesus Christ not you and some other people as long as you have your own thoughts as long as you have your own thoughts of you your own ways your ways a contrary to God this ways tell your neighbor you're always a country um foreign [Applause] for you've got to die at your own thoughts of you he says do you know that your thoughts as long as you look at it as long as you look at it materially in order yourself well that can't happen no game that's not reasonable think of such a thing as long as you do that then you will stay in your condition hello amen God wants you to change your condition God wants to change God wants to bless you God wants to give you the desires as long as you stay with your own Souls of you amen you think of it materially you see it is as long as you stay like that he says you get to a place where you cannot think your ways but come into Christ I think his way of thinking the things begin to shift different away means amen the things will begin at the moment you take God at his wife things will begin to shape different do you want to see a change if you want to follow Jesus you must be willing to drop your ideas foreign Jesus in Romans chapter 6 verse 6 knowing this is crucified with him yeah hallelujah hallelujah they are crucified with Christ they are committed look here man that the body of sin might be destroyed [Music] we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freedom from sin walking on um it cannot succeed [Music] because we are dead to sini and he that is dead the scripture says why didn't you put the scripture up here he that is dead oh yeah yeah Romans 6 6. he that is dead is freed from sin now if we beat Dead with the Christopher Christo be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live is that a man with him we shall live with him Christ died to his desires Must Die to his thoughts die to his ideas the way Jesus was crucified when I am sure I am going to have a new life Jesus rose again with a new purpose let me tell you that is the purpose of the Gospel foreign friend of mine brother Andrew Mar rice wrote a very good piece and I thought I can read a few of these things to you on the Calvary Road his prayer was that he wouldn't have to walk the Calvary Road same with us value nobody wants always seeking the way of least resistance that's why you always says but all the Divine riches hallelujah amen all the Divine richest [Music] road to control and lead your life amen that is the address I believe I should walk off what a tragic Quest when a people turn away from the Calvary Road of love and suffering [Applause] he says all Riches of the glory of God in Christ are on that road all the sweetness all the sweetest fellowship with Jesus is there okay rodri all the all the deepest discoveries of God is the name of the Lord they are all on that road are you hearing me this morning all the most honest prayers Hallelujah man where Jesus life is Christ oh when I'm death is gay or whatever OK Google life on every other road is wasted listen to me young men and young ladies brothers and sisters I've seen too many people in my little lifetime that they will walk on other roads of their lives the climax of their lives for me and my house [Applause] leads to a wasted life hallelujah amen hallelujah amen are you hearing me this morning [Music] [Music] on the third day [Applause] [Music] hallelujah amen wake up no never alone he promised never never to leave me alone he promised never to leave me never to leave me alone when I'm walking Calvary Road he is right with me he can never forsake us even when the toys of life sometimes things seem hard sometimes hallelujah amen continue walking Calvary at the end of this road when I reached my life's journey 22 came Community home when I'm the end of my life's journey I will have somebody waiting for somebody waiting for it when I finish my years I will not have wasted my life I would not have wasted my life regarding Jesus Christ I can never waste my life is it's a Blessed assurance I don't want to live like a king here and then living here the rest of my life I'd rather leave a poor man here poor man on Earth and live a life with my Jesus Christ you might want to turn to that in verse 8 it says again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and shows him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and safe unto him all these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship me then say Jesus unto him get thee hands sudden for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord like God and him only shall thus serve artists Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] he wants the things in the world all of those are mine and even eats Glory Lords in the world you see Russia America see America Europe see Europe you're not everything Australia Australia how many things in the world and then he told him that big one I'm going to give them to you you have to do something little Down and Worship me foreign [Applause] and Jesus was given a free ticket yes listen what are you what are you living for sure [Music] I'm going to give you the whole Kingdom [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] of the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in here did you hear that for all that is in the world see the lust of the flesh the last of the eyes buddy yield of God bite it forever [Music] wanted to offer the kingdom to him Jesus refused it yes he refused it also the option this option was really disappointed when he rose from the day I say he rose triumphant [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah the man he did not raise as somebody who was downcast and fearful and players triumphants [Music] in the message how can I overcome the prophet says that great assault Saturn offer to Forfeit this Kingdom to him foreign [Music] but you remember he was trying to Forfeit them to him without the cross if he did we would be lost but he must come back so you see he was tempted to do it death is a hard thing none of us here want to die if they told you that you're going to die the next minute you would give up everything to live oh yes [Music] they told the king you're going to die immediately thank God give me more time death is a bad thing it's a hard thing he was tempted to take his Liberty and be the king of the earth without the cross subjects would have died Saturn would have gladly made that proposition with him [Applause] he did not do it he come and suffered and he took the hard rocket route Glory at the end of the time foreign let me hope that we are not thinking that following Jesus Christ is the bed of roses [Applause] are we this morning willing to do it to take that same rule that he taken that's the question are we willing to die are we willing to give ourselves up to God are we willing to fulfill the world and the things to serve him for questions [Music] I'll give you one more example in the book of First Samuel chapter 24 summary from verses and it came to pass I'll read in English and then if you want to lugan you can follow your Bible and it came to pass when Saul was returned from following the Philistines that it was told him saying behold David is in the wilderness of engadine then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats and he came to the ship courts by the way where was a cave and Saul went in to cover his feet and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave and the men of David said unto him behold the day of of which the Lord has said unto thee behold I will deliver thine enemy into thy hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee then David arose and cut off the skirt of souls robe privily and it came to pass afterward that David's heart smote him because he had cut off swords cut and he said unto his men the Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master the Lord is Anointed to stretch forth my heart against him saying he is the anointed of the Lord so David stayed his servants with these words and suffered them not to Rise Against soul but Soul rose up out of the cave and went out his way now I want you to see that in here [Applause] [Music] David was anointed to be the next king are you following me he was anointed to be the next king yes and God had rejected soul but remember previously Saul was also an anointed king is Saul was hunting David to kill him but David knew the throne was his and one day as they went into those Mountain areas of energy and soul decided to go by the cave but he did not know that actually David was in the same caves was called unawares and David took out you know one one of the boys told him here my monster God has delivered your enemies into your heart and David took out a sword now the United champion and cut off a piece of the clothes yes the kingdom is mine but this is not how I should get it that was the wrong path I shouldn't take another man is [Applause] touch not my anointed my prophets the anointed of the Lord even if God had rejected him he still was the anointed of the Lord take him off of it the same God that told David he will get there without David doing anything about it all that you desire in your life God can bring you to eat without you doing anything about it right he was tempted the audio came here many times we are tempted and we didn't mean you took a member you see for example for you young people you're going to get a wife but it never tempts you stand your camera and gives you something less tries to kill your life [Applause] because he knows the things that God has prepared for you so he will want to bring you down you get a kingdom without the cross but God is looking for a people are willing to set their heart [Applause] and so he repented himself because that was a temptation but David did not come through with it he did not come he did not sin he did not come through with it he did not kill Saul you see as a child of God you might be tempted many times to get the kingdom without the cross Brothers while there are uh then again you remember like David let's continue further along we will understand cheer up my brother live in the sand come on we will understand it my brother my sister together why they live the better life it seemed watch a lot down life seem to be happier seem to have everything to have nothing amen all other roads are West um David decided to take that road don't take his life he is the anointed of the Lord in other words don't kill the man that is not my way of receiving and taking up the kingdom leave him and they left him and you know one time they were in battle somebody shot an arrow Hallelujah David instead of being excited down in Virginia Brethren don't be easily excitable see with things that people bring to you maybe in trouble what the world offers the offers of the world they did not excite you an interest David was so uh full of characters and he could not take that crown on the basis of rejoicing upon the death of God he told him don't you know he's a man of God and anointed and he killed him right there and then he took his crown foreign Jesus yes through the anointing that was upon him had paid it all for him you are going to have nothing to do with anything that happens around you when God wants to lift you must lifts you my son will fall at your feet amen your box will only be to rise up with surely you rise up okay to the challenge it has been the grace of God Jesus by the prize yes America we have a promise to the nature soon I have just a few two quotes for me to read and now now I'll finish in Daniel I'll first read the scripture here Daniel 7 18 the Bible says but the sense of the most Hearts I'll take this the kingdom nobody had it there I'll repeat it for you Brother picture the signs of the Lord Can someone say it with me you get an angry but the science of the most high shall take the kingdom hallelujah amen and he says and possessed the kingdom they shall possessed Africa America America Australia all the kingdoms of the world we shall take them to chapter 12 hallelujah amen don't accept the devil to show you these little things now Katie whatever at least God was giving you two millions you would be better off and then because of that you stop walking calvary's Road value like let me go out there you can find
