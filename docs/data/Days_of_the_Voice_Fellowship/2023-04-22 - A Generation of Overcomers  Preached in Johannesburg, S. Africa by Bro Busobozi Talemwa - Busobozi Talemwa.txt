your seeds for just a moment amen I just want to greet you all in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ and I would like to thank pastor uh mahere for the invitation uh he and I actually met today for the first time and I noticed that when we met we knew each other it seemed as if we had known each other for a very long time and I noticed in our communication that he's I told him and I told him this I said you're a friend of friends so that means you're my friend because I noticed a few of uh several of my friends that have been talking to within our country and other countries other continents uh ministers that we relate with and work with they work with him and and they are friends with him and so I think we are flowing in the same anointing amen and so I'm happy to be here and to accept his invitation it's a it's a honor to be invited by by him to to be here it's my first time in South Africa and uh I thought I would not be here in the last usually they say it's seven days to apply for a Visa but mine took 15 days and so we thought in the last minute maybe we'll just cancel the South African leg and maybe just be in Zimbabwe but you know I I just uh I think we call it striking I say it on the last minute I am going to walk to the visa application center and pick my passport and so I walked there and and they had not called me they had not texted me but when I arrived I I told them I've come for my passport they said have we called you they said no we um I said you've not called me but I've come for my passport and so it was the lady was going to dismiss me and at that very moment they are called Center came you know called me and A call came on my phone and they said your Visa is ready so so I went there to pick it and I did I picked it and the following day I was on the flight here and we had a smooth flight it was also my first time on our Uganda Airlines you know it just came back in business recently so a lot of fast times fast things fast so but we thank God for his grace and I might be new to you but we are not new to one another we've been in his mind before the foundation of the world and uh I I know that I'm not going to say new things uh whatever we have I think two services or so but in this during this time I I don't expect to hear new things but I'm here to just you know encourage you and you know share uh fellowship with you and see what the Lord is doing in your midst and you hear what the Lord is doing with us and that way we can be encouraged and it will bring us closer to the coming of the Lord amen so receive greetings from the church back home they sent their regards my wife also my wife Rebecca Center regards also to you um and our five uh five children I was telling brother uh the brother that I was with brother Luca and uh I don't know the other brother yes brother blessed I was telling him I said look I have five children and well he said you look young I said yes but I have five children and it's a blessing so he said I'm saying whatever you do it well or don't do it at all and so um if God has given me a wife and a family I should have a family indeed or I shouldn't have a family at all so I'm so grateful and you know God has been a blessing to us and so there's quite a lot that uh I might say but I know usually in the midweek we have a little time and so we want to spare most of the time at least for the sharing of the word and maybe on Sunday we can get to know more of each other and maybe share a little more testimonies of what the Lord has done for us otherwise maybe for a little introduction like the Pastor said I started way earlier in life in the ministry especially I started preaching actually I believed and started preaching this message when I was 15 years by God disgrace and you know God got a hold of me I um my father was a priest in the Anglican church and I thought I was also going to be one because the bishop of our church got a hold of me when I was almost 13 years and it took me in to live with him in his Palace and so I started training me and I started watching him Minister and wearing his big robes and I admired them because you see these people look as if they're very close to God and you also want to be close to God and you feel you want to do something that will bring you close to God so I started admiring you know wearing those robes and having that big ring with a Crosser need to how he gave people you know the blessing and you know you would be in a room and then you pray and then afterwards he's the last one to uh to give them a blessing so then he would say the blessing of the you know the I need to give you the blessing in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit and oh everybody would feel like God has spoken and so I kind of felt that at that time that oh I really want to be this close to God and I want to serve God like this so it was my dream to be a bishop and and uh so one time the bishop asked me can you preach and we're on the dining table you know he had kind of adopted me and so I was 13 years and he said can you preach so I said uh I don't know what to say but of course if he has asked I did not want to turn it down because I I knew in my heart I always wanted to be like him so I say it by God's grace I think I can so it was then that he told me now tomorrow I'm going to uh to go to one of the archdictionaries and I would like you to preach and of course in the Anglican Church to preach you have to put on account so that whole night I didn't sleep I was awake because I was nervous I had never stood before people and whenever the bishop would visit you are expecting at least a minimum of 500 people and I was young and I had never spoken to this uh you know kind of congregation so I didn't sleep the whole night and in the morning you know I was nervous the whole time as we traveled but when I we arrived there of course in the night the lord gave me an inspiration to speak on Galatians chapter 3 and so when we reached there I long story short I I just preached on that and a few people believed on Jesus Christ because I was preaching Jesus Christ as their Savior and so they accepted Christ as their Savior and so about 100 people came and the bishop came and blessed them and he said now you are saved you can go back to your seats and so um from that day I felt that maybe God was you know calling me to the ministry and the bishop loved it so he started each time whenever he would travel to ask me to you know tag along and you know speak in the places where he was going so the whole two years of my life I was with a bishop you know you know traveling with him and preaching and he named me the decision young evangelist and and so the Archbishop one time came and he introduced me said uh the this is our decision young evangelist and in my heart I felt like yeah now it means I'm on the path of becoming a bishop and so because I felt that you know to be a bishop was to be very close to God and I just wanted to be close to God and to serve God and to serve his people that was the desire of my heart it was my ambition you know I don't know how many young people here have Ambitions that was my ambition and so uh that was my plan but God had other plans anyways and so um so that would continue on until I I became 15 and it was at that time when I was 15. that the Lord brought me among Believers of this message and I started hearing the message of the hour I saw this picture for my first time and incidentally my mother brought me in this family friend's house where I was supposed to stay and live with them for for about four years of my school but she told me these people the family friend was a pastor in this message and so and I was supposed to live with him but my mother told me you see that picture I said yes that's the Monday worship so be very careful don't don't hear what they have to say because they are in account so be very careful don't believe what they have to say and they said okay so I always looked at that picture and I wondered I waited for them to bow to that picture but that day didn't come until I asked because they had shared the godhead that shared water baptism they are talked about uh you know Rome and its influence and its false doctrines they are talked about most of the things in the scriptures but they had not talked about that picture so then I waited for them to bow to the picture they did not so I was confused I said my mom told me they worship this man and so one day I asked this uh brother he said who is that man he said oh that's a very good question so then we sat down and for he preached to me for three hours and during that time he of course showed me the script the pro the prophecy how God promised uh that there would come and Elijah and this Elijah would come and turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers and and how is not the man that they are going to worship but he's going to introduce to them Jesus Christ through the his ministry would introduce to them the word which is Jesus Christ and so as we went through that it made sense but nothing in me really wanted to leave the glory which I had been promised the other side and so the bishop had even told me by the way that he would take me to the U.S and you know I would study Theology and then of course I would rise up in the ranks so I didn't want to give up that and this made sense but not it I accepted it in my in my head but in my heart I had I was still holding on to what I I was believing the other side and so here was my turning point and I want to get to this and then we'll get to the one because I was living with a bishop rather with a pastor now and I didn't give you the whole story because of time but I was now living with the pastor of the message in his home I had to go to our church our Anglican Church very early in the morning and then in the up in the mid morning there because of course you know anglicans we just pray for one two hours and then in the mid morning then I would come to the message Church of course I had nowhere to go I had no home to return to they were still at church so I would go and join them and so um I I left that day to go to our church and I reached our church it was the English morning service I don't know how many here were anglicans okay at least I have my fellow Anglican there and so it was the early morning English service and so there were many things that were that of course are done in the church and that day uh the bishop uh rather the oh the bishop stuck in my head so the the the priest came up and she was a woman that day and so she preached a very good someone and but then as she was preaching my heart was telling me because of course remembering what these people were sharing with me the whole time for about six months so you know it's wrong for a woman to a sub authority over a man or to teach and and this woman is teaching and then the other mind was telling me anyway it's once in a while after all most of the time it's a man who preaches so well my mind was telling me to forget it but my heart was telling me it is wrong and then in the same service they taught us to turn towards I think the East and then to recite the Apostles Creed and then within the Apostles Creed there is this phrase and I believe in the Holy Catholic church and this brother I remember the words of the brother when he told me you are Catholic I told him no I am Protestant that's why I am protesting Catholicism so I cannot be Catholic so when everybody was reciting that and he said and I believe in the Holy Catholic Church I said to myself so I was deceived all these years and I didn't know and so um so I was my I was losing my mind I was beginning to lose my mind at that moment because the reality was now beginning to strike me to strike my heart and then they taught us to to turn to look in the red to the to the ray of the church and when we did it was a baptism service so the priest called who is the Godfather and of course you know if you you've been there like my sister you know the pros the pros the process of the procedure so then they gave the name uh to a child to the baby and then the man was the one answering on behalf of the baby and the whole time my mind my heart was telling me this is wrong this is wrong where is it in the Bible where is it in the scripture and so uh at that moment I began to hear a wall something like whirling around my my head I thought it was uh in my head inside my head but I was hearing it also in my ears so I began to look around and wonder what what it was and it was at that very moment as this man was baptizing this baby I baptized in the name of the father taking the holy water so-called and then the voice came out of that and said called me by name you see friends whenever I say this sometimes I wonder whether the people believe it that here but the truth is this is exactly what happened and the voice called me by name and said talimua find the nearest exit and leave this place because you were in the wrong place and when I heard that I didn't believe it myself and then and then at that moment you know the the voice came the second time and I was just lingering and the voice when the voice came the third time I didn't do it I picked my Bible it had a red cover just like this and then I swung my way out of the church and that was would be my last time as a member in the Anglican Church but make no mistake I had not made up my mind to join the message yet so because I this voice pulled me out of that but it did not pull me out of the other I mean into the other so I had now I was pulled out but I still had nowhere to go I had many questions I was too confused to go anywhere or to join any uh in a church because now here I had dumped my lifelong ambition and so of course as usual I found myself in a believer's church because that's where the people that I was living with were going I had nowhere else to go Brethren I found the other time I think a few days ago I Saw You Preach and that's how that brother was preaching he was preaching as if he had fire under his toys and and he was pounding the word pounding the word and do you know what he was preaching about the things I left in my church one by one he was hitting them one by one by one by one I couldn't help it but my heart because my heart you know you know begun to respond to what I was hearing and it was at that very moment that uh when he finished preaching he called us who had given their lives to Jesus Christ I was still you know hesitating to go and and that atmosphere came back again around where I was and I you know I began uncontrolling it I was not able to control myself I began to shake my body was like shaking you know friends the presence of God is real the power of God is real the holy spirit is real and if only we can believe it if you have never experienced it just believe it one day you're going to experience it and so as I was shaking uncontrollably at that moment that voice came back again and and called me again by the same surname said talimoire stand up on your feet raise both your hands up and declare on top of your voice that you have believed this message to be the truth and you would like to be baptized and then I first a battle that I had never faced before that voice would speak and another voice would speak that voice would speak it came second when it was coming the third time I felt like I had no control over this and I wanted to let this go so I stood up and you know tears began flowing through my eyes and I lifted up one of my hands it said two but because maybe because of fear I I you know lifted up only one and I tried to shout but I couldn't shout and I just said I've believed this message and I would like to be baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and you know everybody started clapping their hands and you know there was like commotion that there were about 15 people but you would say you would maybe think they were like 200 because of exact the excitement that was there and they were not rich people they were very poor people and of course this is one of the reasons why I didn't want to believe the message because where I was they were well to do living in Palisades big churches here they are poor they are living in Ashanti place which they are calling a church place and I was really looking down on them but here the Holy Spirit arrested me I didn't remember any of that and so they collected a little money and and put fewer in one of the cars that was there at the time and they took me and baptized me and at 15 I got baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and Friends from that moment when I came out of the Waters of baptism I made up my mind and I pledged my life to serve the Lord and tell people about this end time message because guess what I believe this message now to be the truth and if there is one thing I've come to do here is maybe to give a testimony to inspire one or two and encourage them and tell them that this message is the truth praise the name of the Lord it's been how many years since brother Barnum left the sin 50 80 years I was just looking at it today he preached the last sermon 58 years ago and there's been brother Barnum told us that a generation is 40 so it's been one generation past and another one is also going and another one will come we do not know when the Lord will come but we know soon and very soon he will come but if the Lord comes we want to find ourselves ready but I believe that we are living in a Time friends if you look around yourself and you see the age and the age that you have and the age that somebody else has and the Ministries that God is raising up in our time surely No Doubt we are in another generation and we are in a generation of people that must not only believe the message but be enthused about the message be zealous about this message and be able not only to preach it but to take it out not to preach it in the church only but to take it out to the streets to the byways if this message is worth living for then it is worth dying for and we should do all that we can to take this message out and so friends without wasting more time I'd like you to stand we'll check one um just one line out of James chapter 4 verse 7. and um I woke up at 3 A.M yesterday was it today yeah you see I've even lost track of time on on time so I'm not a hundred percent sober because I didn't have enough time to rest but when the Holy Spirit takes all takes over I believe that he will be able to I think it's better that way when I'm not sober so that he can be able to take over and speak whatever he wants to speak to the people Pastor I'd like to know how much time do we have praise the name of the Lord well I'll preach as long as you can you can bear me with me James chapter 4. verses 7. submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will free flee from you can we all read it together submit yourselves thereofer to God resist the devil and he will flee from you amen may the Lord bless the reading of the word let us pray Lord Jesus we want to commit this session into your hands the little moments we're going to be here together father I might not be the one that is worthy to Stand Here Lord Jesus but I pray that you will come and take over guide my lips guide my mind guide My Heart Lord Jesus and even the people father that oh God you will inspire all of us together into the channel that you have desired and designed for all of us today that we will hear from Heaven Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats so this morning I'd like to speak or or not only this evening but uh the the for the for the whole time I'll be here the Lord willing what I have on my my mind is what I just introduced to you a generation the general a generation of Overcomers but this evening I have a little thought and this came to me while I was asking the Lord what I will speak on and you know the word just came to me no negotiations and so I wanted to look through the scripture and find out about this negotiation I don't know if we have a salesman here or sales people here you know they're very good at negotiating if you uh you go especially here in Africa I don't know in South Africa it is South Africa but I'm from Uganda where it is Africa I had Pastor call it Africa so here it is South Africa and in Africa we like negotiating When someone tells you that something is 5000 you don't easily bite at 5000 you ask them can you reduce for me can you make it can you make it can you can the price go down a little bit so you know we negotiate and some people are very good negotiators and you know and so but you see there's something that I believe as a generation the time that we have arrived at that we must not negotiate with vote you see there are many things that the devil has desired to Rob away from us you see this message that we have believed the end time message is a message of restoration God has sent a prophet with a message of restoration it is not to bring or to form another denomination or another church this message came to bring death to to make to bring uh I should say to bring life out of death now you remember that story of Ezekiel you know the voice told him Ezekiel can this uh at bonds Dry Bones live again you know you see this message is the life that can make and put life again in the dry bones praise the name of the Lord and so we are in a wrestling match with the Devil and you know as we all know the battle did not start here the battle started way up in heaven so actually we are fighting the Battle of angels the battle started in heaven but we are right now we found ourselves in the middle of this battle actually one brother one time uh one of the uh children of mine in the Lord in Ethiopia he was preaching and he said this and it really stuck with me he said why did God not finish the devil why did he throw him down to the Earth because he wanted you know God is God and how could God destroy the Devil he would how could he stoop someone to destroy the Devil he had to throw him down here so that his sons can finish him so we are here to finish this battle we are here not to negotiate with the devil we are here to finish whatever we are fighting this is a battle of angels and it be you know it became the Battle of men and most like the Fallen Angels you know will be outmatched by the devil and it is so sad to see even sometimes people claiming to believe this message after 30 years they come up and say well I uh why the reason why I left and it is so sad that even Believers would waste their time to listen to such stuff as that you know the devil wants us to come to a place of compromise the devil wants us to lose vision on what we have received the devil is working every day to try and hinder us the devil is working every way to try and take us away from the prize that God has intended for us in this in this our time our day our generation but I want to tell you there are many people falling for the trick of the devil there are many people who are outmatched by the devil but there is a race there is a people there is a generation that is going to overcome did you know that in every generation there was a people there was a race there were those that were called that were known by God before the foundation of the world and they were predestinated to overcome I believe I'm one of them Hallelujah when I believe the message I had them sing that song one of them oh I love that song one of them one of them I'm so glad that I can say I am one of them I did not believe this message only to be defeated by the devil I believed this message to overcome the world I believe this message to live as an overcomer and I believe friends there is nothing can overcome a Believer who will stand on the grounds of the world how many believe that Victory Is Ours over the world and Over The Temptations they are of their many Temptations in the world there are three things that the Bible speaks of the pride of life the lust of the eyes and the lust of the Flesh and these are the things that have you know come to attack every living mortal every one of you has been attacked by those three things every living human being will be attacked by those three things even Jesus himself was attacked by those three things but did you know that Jesus overcame why did you overcome because Jesus was born for a purpose and the purpose of Jesus's birth was to overcome the devil once and for all and I want to say that as Believers of this message when you receive this message hallelujah praise the name of the Lord this message is putting us in a place whereby we can be able to overcome the devil all the people out there cannot be able to overcome the overcoming power is within the message of the hour and I would like to say let us march on let us fight for every inch of ground that the Lord has promised us we should never come to a place of negotiation negotiating with Saturn we are to fight because Victory is assured I'd like you to look at First Peter Chapter 5 Verse 6 it says humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your cares upon Him for he cares for you be sober be vigilant because your anniversary the devil has a rolling lion walketh about seeking whom he made divine whom resists steadfast in in the faith in their faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world unless you praise the name of the Lord now I'd like you to look at this he says that because your adversary the devil has a rolling lion worketh about seeking whom he may divide it you know that every day that you rise up early in the morning the devil has a trap set for you did you know that the devil never sleeps he never actually he never Slumbers he is always awake to try to see how he will trap you to try to see how he will divert you you try to see how he'll bring you down but the Bible says listen he says what should we do as Believers he says we should resist him study firstly in the faith he did not say by faith he said in the faith so what faith in the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints in the master of the hour amen knowing that the same afflictions are accomplishing your brethren that are in the world Amen there is nothing that you are going through that no that another brother is you know has never gone through whatever you are going through somebody else has gone through it and that's not all whatever we are going through Jesus Christ went through it what did you know that whatever battle you're fighting Jesus Christ fought it to the extent that brother said he was tempted with all manner of temptations that we attempted with even sexual Temptations there is no temptation that you go through amen that Jesus did not go through but Jesus went through it and overcame it Hallelujah in order for what in order for us also to overcome Jesus was first with the devil but Jesus if there is one thing that Jesus never did Jesus never negotiated with Satan whenever he met Satan he stood on his ground he never negotiated he never negotiated but the problem that we have in our generation many young people many people and negotiating with the devil when you know your god-given rights when you know your god-given promises but you wash and see the devil take it away from you and you do nothing about it why does the devil done Even in our message fraternity the devil has replaced the fire of God the Devils replace Let the Fire of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost with just church and doctrines I'm sorry if I say what you don't want to hear Hallelujah the devil has replaced it you know with just formality the devil has made a Baptist religion but let me tell you we are not about this religion we are believers of the end time message hallelujah holy ghosts filled thanks speaking fire pact children of God Amen who are being prepared to go in the rapture I will tell you why I left the Anglican Church I left the Anglican church because I want to go in the rapture [Applause] and I am determining I am determined no matter what comes my way I must go in the rapture [Applause] Hallelujah we are not going to negotiate with the Devil Hallelujah if you want to replace him and the fire of God with the religion what are we going to do we are not going to negotiate with the Devil Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord do you love the message When you pray for people you apologize say Mr devil would you please move over and let me did you know there are some people in the message who are no longer praying for the sick and they are preaching it as a Doctrine now I believe when you are here when you're in your seats and you're hearing the word I believe the word can heal you right but I also believe in praying for the sick and laying on of hands amen but you see you know they would say you know Mr Deva would you please move over here and let me you know and by the manam says nothing faith has got masses and here on its chest when it speaks everything else shuts up don't go in Mr devil you move out Hallelujah get out here I'm a Son of God I'm commissioned of God leave them alone and he says that moves you have no apology to the devil nothing to do with him not ashamed of the word of God not ashamed of your commission not ashamed of who we are we know who we are and we are not going to be ashamed of it we are not going to be apologetic we know what we believe we are not going to happen to apologize for what we believe Hallelujah we are not ashamed of this message we are not ashamed to tell the people God has sent a prophet in our generation we are not ashamed to say we believe Amen in the bathroom of the Holy Ghost we are not ashamed Hallelujah let me tell you if you are ashamed of it it means you don't believe it but if you believe it you cannot be ashamed of it oh Hallelujah the key is in knowing who you are if we know who we are we will not be ashamed of the word if we are amen not ashamed of the word we will not negotiate if we are not ashamed of the word amen we will not negotiate let me tell you something here I was just reading an article here and and this whoever wrote it I just read it for you so that you can get the understanding of what negotiation is and it says for new kids politicians in the U.S and the UK have gradually stated that we do not negotiate with terrorists arguing that it is both morally indefensible and impractical likely to encourage mortalism and Lead ministerialist aims and in March 1973 members of a Palestinian militant organization took a group of hostages in the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum among them three westerners now asked at a press conference how his government would respond U.S president Richard Nixon replied I love this response so seemingly off the card that there could be no negotiation with terrorists his people we are caught we are Behind Enemy Lines and he understood that this might mean actually signing a death warrant for them but he knew if he negotiated with the terrorists it was going to start up or to put a precedent which was going to be very hard for him and for his government so he knew he had a decision to take imagine the devil maybe might have taken some of your things hostage he might have taken some of your loved ones hostage he might have done something bad in your family something bad in your life something bad amen you know he might have taken your Victory away from you amen but the many Believers what do they do they want to negotiate with the devil but let me tell you here is aiming a politician amen Richard Nixon the President of the U.S at the time he said let me let me tell you there will be no negotiation with terrorists do you know what happened the following the Western hostages were killed since then the policy has become all but impossible to roll back from becoming integral to us and to UK foreign policy Doctrine I thought when I was reading this I thought they were going to change their mind they never changed their mind even when their people died I who do I remember he man when they stood amen before the tourists of that time they said listen we shall not bow we shall not Bend we shall not negotiate we know who we believe we know and we are persuaded he is able to keep every promise in man [Applause] Hallelujah and he said I will throw you through the I will throw you in the fire he said well you can try but even in the fire amen we will not negotiate and right there when they threw them in the fire oh my God praise the name of the Lord when they threw them in the fire he was right there in the fire [Applause] Hallelujah let me tell you the devil is a terrorist his intention is from the very beginning have been to steal to kill and to destroy God has given us his unfailing promises in the message of the hour how many believe that the message of Yahweh is God is unfailing promises to us amen and you know to negotiate with the Devil oh you know to uh to negotiate with the Devil is actually for Faith what belongs to you what belongs to us and his message the message of the hour the promises it is given to us is is given I would like to say that the message of the hour is our Birthright how many believe that the message of the hour is our Promised Land the message of the hour is Our Hope the message of the hour is where our anchor holds I'm in another song The Anchor Holds even when the ship is battered but The Anchor Holds amen and therefore let me tell you we should not negotiate with the devil in any way because if we do we are forfeiting what belongs to us to negotiate with him is legitimize he's terrorist aims to negotiate with him is actually morally indefensible and impractical just like the amen President Nixon said Hallelujah what is yours is yours and you claim it Hallelujah oh my my whatever whatever you are hearing I'm just introducing myself to you and I'm not going to get into big meat I'm just go you know going into a little thing so I just wanted to catch it receive it don't wait for me to preach I'm already preaching whatever is yours is yours claim it Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord can you imagine I don't know whether you have that here but back in our country there would be people who actually are satisfied with head knowledge at the expense of the power the manifestation of life the message of the hour is not just the knowledge that is the beginning you see the message of the hour is the life that is why you've seen people who actually can come in church like this and I believe in listening to tapes I I listen to them I've given a lot of people a means to be able to listen to the message of the hour I mean to listen to the verse about the bottom I believe in that 100 and you see when when you talk about what I'm going to say many people say oh you're fighting brother no nobody no we're not fighting brother actually we are saying what he's saying because we are in the spirit of what he was in Hallelujah when badam said he was saying what Paul said he did not read the letter to the Corinthians and then you know chapter one chapter two chapter three what by what no he was preaching in the same anointing and In The Same Spirit in the same manifestation of power and so you find people who are satisfied and you see this is an evil spirit which is coming to drain the power of God out from the church to try and make this message powerless to try and bring it to a place where God is not moving to try and bring it to a place where people are not being filled with the Holy Ghost to try and bring it to our place where it is undermining the power of God to move in the lives of the people where it is undermining the power of God and the potential of the work where they will tell people look you don't have to you know to to preach you just come and we'll put a tape and then afterwards you will go home even they're making you know the tape weird couples they're even making depths evangelize out there they are making you know what is this this is not God doing this it cannot be God because Jesus Christ I know of the Bible amen he says it's the same yesterday today and forever if he sent Holy Ghost preachers in the beginning he will do it today he will do it tomorrow he will do it every time Hallelujah a church amen that we will believe in the power of God a church that you will believe amen that this message can be able to come down from the tape and be able to live in US one time I was I was you know just to prove to you that this message is alive I believe this message with all my heart and when I believed I was young but I I started to listen to the tips right away and I remember there is a one tip I was listening to I was in my bedroom and I'd close the door and I was just there listening and I had stomach ache and I had headache and I was not really in good in good health condition and I sat down there to listen to the message and and as brother Barnum was designing he preached of course the sermon and I usually love to hear until now I usually love to hear what he's designing you know what is that it is God vindicating that what he preached was true did you did you notice it is very few Services where brother Barnum preached and God did not vindicate himself in most of the services after there was a preaching you know you hear tongues after that I was preaching you see this element coming for you see healing you see this you see what God Amen confirming his presence in his people and I believe that same that is the same God today and brother Barnum you know what as I was listening I used I usually love that part and I I was not in a good health condition and as I I listened it came to a place where he started designing people one by one and I prayed in my heart softly and I said God you know I don't know if you have ever prayed an impossible prayer Pastor I prayed I said God if this message be true those were the times that I just believed that I was on fire for the locations said if this message be true and this man of God be indeed the prophet to our generation to the whole world I was not there in his time but I want him to design me now as I'm listening I want him to design me that's what I prayed and as I was listening he designed one sister she left another and she left and then he could come here brother I was like all the time under expectation who do you call me and then that brother left and then he called this man and listened to me oh my I still remember that that atmosphere and as he called this man I just feel as if you know when someone called your name no matter where you I just feel like something jumps within you you know they've called your name so he said come here sir and when they came said yo you were a brother oh you're a minister and this was so far all true to me and then he said uh you you have stomach trouble and then he started explaining why what caused the stomach trouble and when I start to reflect on my life I noticed that was actually the same same thing and he said he began to pray to pray for him and he told him to lift up his hand so I lifted up his hands and tears were flowing down on my eyes and let me tell you friends at that exact moment I received my healing and it it only him you were healed I was also receiving my healing and he never mentioned the name of the man I believe it was on purpose because I had to listen to that and I had to apply it upon my life Hallelujah you know he says that our names were not on that book and he says not like Joshua not like you know we were right there in his mind before the foundation of the world this message is here to call your name this message is here to give you life this therefore what am I trying to say I'm trying to bring to convince you to understand that listen you don't need to negotiate with the Devil because God has given us a message which has everything that we need if we believe this message in his entirety amen we can see the same thing that was there in the days of the Apostles if we believe what Amen brother Barnum preached to us and we really not just understand it but believe it in our heart God can come and be made manifest enough you know I made it what is ours is ours and we must claim it hallelujah what is yours I want to say healing is yours I don't have to amen live here in benoni when I believe the message and I am sick and I am coming to church I'm going back sick no until some Believers are going to Pentecostals for healing who told you there is no healing here I want to say healing is yours victory is yours Holiness is yours overcoming power is yours Hallelujah some people think that this message has no power to make you live a holy life no that is a Lie from the Pips of Hell amen there is enough power in this message to turn a sinner into a saint [Music] Hallelujah one day I was in Ethiopia and this prostitute came to approach us for business I was with a brother from Nairobi you know the brother Pastor mahere because you were in their Church and I was with his brother his name is Paul and brother Paul was in the world before he believed the message he was arrested and everything so I told him brother Paul I think you know how to do this brother Paul might be listening actually I don't know so I told him you might have more experience than I so can you please start start her so you started her and because she came to approach us we did not know initially but when we found out that you know this was her intentions so I told Brother Paul to talk to her and then so we spoke to her and then we gave her an appointment so she came and met us later on and and we were with her sister who had believed earlier and guess what happened you see like those two young men said silver and gold we have a Havana but what we have we give unto you so this woman wanted money and wanted an immoral life but what we had we gave unto her the following day we baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ after being a prostitute for more than 10 years now tell me that this semester you cannot turn a sinner into a saint to the extent that when we see people especially young people I'm sorry I have a burden for young people so I don't know I I I'm not looking at each of you so I don't know how old you are but you know what I want to say is until the young people you know no longer find uh peace to come in our message churches why because when they come and you know they're overtaken in the world and so when you know sister you can't dress like that well of course we believe in dressing well as believers but there's a better way in reaching out to a Cena Hallelujah do you know the better way is introducing to them the power that can change them Hallelujah you know there is nothing as good as watching a scene as someone coming to church taking drugs someone coming to church as a drunk and someone coming to church wearing trousers and watch the Power of the word transform them into the image of Jesus Christ there is nothing as beautiful as that and I want to say this is ours we should claim it we should not negotiate with the devil but you know we should do this and that no amen Holiness is ours him and the overcoming power is ours you know Rapture is ours how many believe that and I want to say Amen even you only believe in children they are yours you can claim them they are yours amen your children amen are yours your wife amen maybe if your wife is unbelieving or whatever it is amen or somehow some who are not married yet and they are praying and they're waiting and they are not seeing until they even feel that they are losing hope in the church they think maybe he's the church the problem or the past the problem let me tell you the devil is just trying to negotiate with you Hallelujah you must just believe that your wife is yours whatever she is believed for her God is able to bring her Hallelujah do not negotiate about it just claim whatever belongs to you never negotiate without because when you negotiate with him you are setting a wrong precedence now I'm going to give you an example of one brother who actually refused to negotiate with the devil how many want to see him just open with me the book of Exodus chapter 10 verse 24. and Pharaoh called unto Moses and said go ye and serve the Lord only let your flocks and your hearts be stayed let your little ones also go with you and Moses said thou must give us also sacrifices and banned offerings that he we may sacrifice unto the Lord Our God our cattle also shall go with us there shall not and who be left behind for thereof must we take to serve the Lord Our God and we know not what with what we must serve the Lord until we come hither here is a man talking of Moses who actually grew up in in Egypt you remember the story of how it all started with Joseph and how these these Jews came in Egypt and how later on they became slaves in Egypt and after many many years well of course they wanted to kill and Moses happened to be one of the boys that survived did you hear that he survived you were here because of a reason and I believe I am in this generation because God has brought me here God brought this message my way because he knew I survived for a purpose so that I can be able to hear it that go with God there is nothing that happens by coincidence this is not coincidence that right now I'm here in benoni or that you are here or that this is your pastor it's not a coincidence it is all designed by God before the foundation of the world and it everything God was bringing it so that you can be able to overcome because in every generation they are Overcomers they that shall overcome in every generation must be there they are you know you notice in the in the church ages it says to to the to the Overcomers he has a message to the Overcomers in every Church age in every Church age in every Church age so I believe in ours also there are Overcomers and here Moses survived death and survived to be killed and he grew up in the palace and after a while Moses now was representing the generation I want to say he was representing the generation over the Overcomers he was representing the generation of the people who were not going to negotiate with the devil whatever was theirs was theirs actually mothers was was so zealous that you remember how he took down that Egyptian and he killed him with his own bare hands because he he had that thing in him that what is mine is mine and nobody can take it from me and when he saw he when he saw this Egyptian you know trying to strike the the Jew he felt bad and I said no no no no no I can't let this happen brother sister business but don't be over don't out don't let yourself not out should I say out zero the word should be within the word Hallelujah and so this brother you know he had not received an experience with God he had not received the Holy Ghost that's why we have to be patient with some people sometimes they do things wrong because they have no experience with God but wait until they receive that experience you will notice amen that they will change actually when you receive the Holy Ghost you don't even need to trumpet it everybody will see your life you will change you will be a changed woman you change the younger man it changed the point change the woman change it man and so Moses you know was so full of zeal and he went out there in the desert and uh he met with God and when he met with God he came down to Egypt he did not come he came on a mission but his mission was not to negotiate and so as the plagues of course you know the whole story of the plagues and when they Heat and the Heat and the Heat the king or the Pharaoh the only thing he could think of was to negotiate with this man you know when when two armies uh uh each of them when both of them are like very strong and uh they feel that this Army feels like I cannot overcome the other army or I can overcome them some some place but then again I will have a lot of losses here in my own Camp they try to negotiate instead you remember the other time when uh the the Goliath came down and he said well send me your best I'll just uh when you win us well then we consider that victory is yours that was negotiation he was trying to negotiate with them you see and that's that's usually The Art of War they try to because you know nobody was going to beat him don't think that David negotiated with him he did not negotiate with him you know Moses I mean David came up and he said who is he who is he that can defy the armies of the Living God who is he that's why even David refused all these things they're trying to put on him because he did not need anything to try and negotiate with amen with this man he knew that what he had was enough he had Jesus he had faith in the world and by the bottom said faith has masses amen he had the word and we have the word today and this word is enough to overcome the devil and and at that moment you know when he's swung that stone it hit right in the head of uh in the head of Goliath because it had Faith behind it and so we will notice here that Moses the same thing when Moses came and Pharaoh tried to negotiate with him say Well now I think what we can do Moses okay I agree now because this uh pestilences and plagues and they're really so heavy on my kingdom and so now I'm no longer God okay now let us talk man to man let us negotiate now so now I'm requesting that at least to you that a man can go and serve you our God but for these children they cattle and everything that one can remain for sure but the rest Let It Go and see what Moses said he said thou must give us also sacrifices and bad offerings that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God our cattle also shall go with us notice that the way he is phrasing his words he's not saying might could should he say avocado also shall go with us they are shall not and hoof be left behind for they all must we take to serve the Lord Our God and we know not with what we must serve the Lord until we come and I also want to put my voice here and say there shall not and whoof be left behind we shall not leave any little one behind we shall be there with everything we love amen whoever you love actually can go in the Rapture did you know that you can be another Arab and claim them apply the talking of the word apply the talking of the blood and God is more than able to save them and redeem them and change them Hallelujah and this man believed that everything that they needed and everything that was theirs nothing should be left behind and in Exodus chapter 10 verse 8 notice he says and Moses and Aaron were brought again unto pharaoh and he said unto them God serve the Lord your God but who are they that shall go and Moses said we will go with our younger men and with our old and with our sons and with our daughters and with our flocks and with our head hurts we will go for we must hold a feast unto the Lord and he said unto them let the Lord be so with you as I will let you go and your little ones look to it listen to these phrases here says let the Lord be so with you as I will let you go now about your little ones look to it in our language you would say um I don't know how we would say it here in uh languages here look to it you know look for it I almost said it look to it for evil is before you for evil is before you don't you see the man is trying to what to negotiate not so good now that he a man answer the Lord for you know for for that ye the desire this is your desire your desire was to go and serve God so you that are men go but these little ones leave them those girls leave them those younger young ones leave them no problem you go and you know you know those days when you go to church and you leave your children at home that's what the devil wants you to do drag your children to church bring them here even if even if they are not converted there is enough power here to convert them how many believe that hallelujah what I do back home I tell the young men I don't care how you feel amen one one came to me you know you know using uh uh drugs they told me Pastor I cannot make I feel like I told him listen I don't don't worry no matter what you do you just come and sit under the one if you come in a Bible believing Church like this amen you there is that unless it's not a Bible believing Church unless what you're hearing is not the word but if it is the word you are bound to change it is not you going to change yourself don't worry about how you're feeling come under the word the word will correct the error Hallelujah and so and so here notice he told him he says oh that a man go but you know the children leave them behind these leave them behind the women leave them behind but Pharaoh had no choice I want to say this Pharaoh had no choice but to let Moses go Hallelujah the message of Moses Hallelujah the message of Moses was let my people go that was from God it was not Moses's message the message of William Branham is let my people go that was from God not from William Branham Hallelujah whenever you hear the message or whenever you hear an inspired preaching with the inspiration of the message let me tell you a hearing let my people go and whenever you come and sit under the word sometimes you are tired but don't you worry something is happening on the inside something is happening on the inside whenever we come let me tell you the change of the body is already happening it is a process Hallelujah the Rapture is not an event the Rapture is already happening when we reach the resurrection morning people won't understand amen those who were not already in the process will miss it but let me tell you whoever will miss it has already missed it to you who is sitting under the word amen you are being chained you are being raptured you are being transformed into the image of Jesus Christ that's why you should not allow the devil to negotiate with you let me tell you this message is let my people go let me tell you it is not going to be on Pharaoh's terms it is going to be on Moses's terms Hallelujah you are going to overcome the world not on the devil's terms on your terms you are going to receive your Victory not on the devil's terms not on the world distance not on an education term not on a politics times Hallelujah are you hearing me there are many things there are many encumberences that actually bring us down politics you know the education and you know the the systems of the world the way they are fashioned and the tribalism and someone said do you have tribes here yeah in in our country in our country we have tribes and our president comes from one specific tribe so most of the people don't like that tribe now and because they feel the those ones are the oppressors and these ones are the oppressed and so you you feel like you know even here in South Africa you know you had our parasite we say we study about it all over and so you see these are the things that actually people you find even Believers putting themselves into those kind of things the devil wants you to negotiate on his terms Believers are believers all over the world we are not to be taken or overtaken by the spirits of politics or by the spirits of all countries we are supposed to be overtaken by one spirit amen the spirit of heaven and that's the Holy Spirit Hallelujah so Moses amen I want to say how to go and his people had to go but it was not going to be on Pharaoh's terms Saturn things he has but he actually has no choice but to let you go he has to let you walk into your god-given promises even even as I was writing this I said to myself yes atan has to let me walk into my god-given promises he has no choice but to let me go listen I was just a little boy bound there Amen in the Anglican church and the devil thought yes I'm going to take this young man his life and I'm going to ride it and I'm going to write on it and to take him here to take him there that was his terms but listen the devil did not know that he cannot take me on his terms how many you are here on the times that God has set for you not what the world has given you even Jesus said I give them peace not what the word gives them but what their father gives them let me tell you this message has come with a power amen that is so different from what the world can give you another Son of God you are going to make this you are going to overcome this you are going to overcome the world the Bible says that they that are born of God overcome the world we are going to overcome the world on our terms Hallelujah on our times not on the devil's terms hallelujah praise the name of the Lord Exodus 12. I wanted to look at that and Pharaoh rose up in the night and he he and all his servants and all the Egyptians and there was a great cry in Egypt for there was not a house where there was not one dead and he called for Moses and Aaron by night and said Raisa and get you forth from among my people both ye and the children of Israel and go and serve the Lord as ye have said huh I want you to see the agency that with which this man is speaking what was happening with him at first he thought he was God do you know that some people they look for jobs and they don't find jobs and they said well you can't get job a job without corruption you have to do something in order to get a job but let me tell you you have to learn that a Believer if you know who you are you should never negotiate with the Devil whatever you are going to get you should get it on your terms it should be the devil to bow down to you not you to bow down to him you see here this man who was sitting up there like God himself now he is the one coming down here and he's saying uh hey please hey please raise up and get get you forth from among my people go go go go go you and your children oh they should not be said go go and serve the Lord as you have said did you hear that as you have said and then he said that was not all versator 2. also take your flocks and your hearts as ye have said and be gone and bless me also and the Egyptians were urgent upon the people they were urgents upon the people that they might send them out of the land in haste for they said we will all be dead men imagine the devil trying to release you to trying to let your blessing go try and let your Victory go because he knows he will be dead if he doesn't do that because he knows he cannot negotiate with a believer and the people took their Duff before it was leaving their needing troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders and the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses and they borrowed of the Egyptians Jewelers of silver and jewels of God and Raymond and the lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians so that they lent unto them such things as they required and they spoiled the Egyptians and the children of Israel Janet from Ramesses to suck off about 600 000 on foot that were men beside children that is going to happen but on your terms Hallelujah maybe somebody's dozing tell your neighbor on your terms come on tell your neighbor on your time it's going to happen on your terms it's going to happen on our times the devil has no legal right and but the bottom says here but brother when you get a courage enough to step out toy to toi line with the devil and cut him off I went to my house tonight I got a legal deed for my house if I went in there and someone was laying there drinking and carrying on and doing uh wrong I would say you will have to get out my friend well this is a house for human beings you would say I I've got a right to be in here then I would say you do not I possess this house it's mine you see the devil will bring you all sorts of things sickness that I will bring you depressions listen there is some demons that the devil is using As Weapons against the children of God in our time now ah depressions you know he's using this against Believers but let me tell you depression is one of the most stubborn demons it comes unto men's Believers you know they are depressed and they are oppressed by the by by the kingdom of darkness and maybe some of them don't know you feel your Joys has gone and you no longer have the joy of the Lord you come to church you can't even Praise You Can't Worship You Can't Dance you can't do anything you are just sad let me tell you it's a devil but let me tell you here like brother but I'm saying here when you find that devil on your property you have a right to tell them listen you have no right to be here and then they will tell you well I have a right then you would say no I possess this house it is mine where you would say gonna write just like sickness under the body of sin or whatever it is say where the other one bring the other ones drink the other ones do this or the others this way but he has no legal rights the devil has no legal rights the devil has no legal rights to bring you a tormenting spirit did you know that people can come and be in church and be seated in church and you know enjoy the world but when they have tormenting Spirits spirits that are tormenting them because the devil the devil realizes that he cannot actually Hinder the purpose of God for your life so what does it do he tries to delay your breakthrough he tries to divert you he tries to confuse you he tries to bring in things maybe in your home or in your family that will try to take you away from the the things you should be looking at you see it it tries to do that but listen I want to tell you tonight the devil has no legal rights Hallelujah bear with me a few more minutes he says and I couldn't I could take my abstract deed and go down to the courts and say look here someone has moved in here that doesn't belong here this is mine it belongs to me and the law would come up and put them out because I have an abstract written deed to that property brother and sister Hallelujah we have an abstract written date tonight we have an abstract to Salvation we have an upside to Divine Healing and the devil's has not right oh Hallelujah trust God and the Holy Ghost to put him out that's all amen say I feel religious tonight somehow I really do all right the devil has no right how many feel good about that when I was reading that and I thought about my life I said yes the devil has no rights he can try to put in something in your home in your life even in the church but let me tell you the devil cannot span because he has no legal rights to torment the church to take them away from their birthrights the Devil by the bottom says he's a bluff don't worry as soon as you make your decision the devil is going to give you a shock don't worry he's the biggest Bluff I know of but he is the only he is only a bluff did you hear me he is a bluff he says that's all he is he ain't got one legal power Jesus Christ stripped him of everything he had on Calvary the full sin penalty was paid at Calvary and the devil has no legal rights at all what is there left for a believer if we can know who we are where we are standing there is a song that says Standing on the Promises of God you know sometimes you know when you travel different places and you know things that others know and you you know songs that they know you know things that they know you you say Amen to the same things you really believe the Rapture is going to happen the heaven is surely there it must be there surely you know recently a brother came a brother came from Sweden to our fellowship and and I didn't even know he was a minister only to find out he's a pastor so I asked him to minister to us and and when he got to preach he preached exactly what I wanted to preach and he was speaking exactly what he was in the church and no one knew you see what is that it is to prove that these things are real and God is real and Heaven is real and the message is real and the Rapture is real and the holy ghost is real God is real and therefore we as Believers must just realize who we are and our ground amen if we can stand our ground and not accept negotiate with the devil this is what I'm sure you your pastor is ready to you many many times but let me just rehearse a little bit as we finish here he says now remember this Christ is the true church Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts how many believe that Hallelujah but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come in to the church and Define it the purpose of the devil the desire he has is to try and defile the church let me post there a moment the devil wants to make it a lukewarm Church the devil wants to make it a formal and Powerless charge where they will take things that actually are Apostolic and they will tell you that those are for Pentecostals where they will take the promises that God has given us to us in his word and they will say we do not need them the devil's purpose has always been to make us look warm for more powerless but this book exported Saturn revealing his works what is his works the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right under the time he is accustomed to the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works the devil knows that she will be an invisible Army do you know what an invisible Army is which you can try to fight but you are fighting it at your own burial you will not win no matter what you do I don't know whether that is sinking in imagine the devil fighting you as much as he wants to fight you but he can never win imagine that he if he brings this you overcome he brings this you overcome he brings this and he keeps bringing more things but each thing he brings you overcome you overcome you overcome the True Believer of this message is actually an invisible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit design and withstanded Antichrist spirit Saturn will be powerless before her imagine your enemy being there as an enemy but powerless can't overcome he will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Saturn hates revelation but we love it how many love revelation with the true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them we will prevail over every Spirit we will prevail over every demon that will come to fight us in our generation right now in our country how many have heard about the bill that the parliament has tried to put up in Uganda oh not many people are informed about it yes the the the the the it's called the homosexuality bill in our country so that many people are calling it Draconian or whatever it is to begin with it wasn't supposed to be there but I when I when I saw what our government is trying to do or what the parliamentarians are trying to do to protect what they call the culture the Norms of the people and at what lengths they can go to try and protect that I often wonder what do you think that God will do or not do to try and protect his church but with whatever they're doing actually they can't stop what the devil is doing they can't stop it you see remember as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be and these are the days that we are living in and this is a time that actually the son of man has been revealed we are living in that time where it was promised that Jesus Christ would be revealed as a son of man again and that has happened already in our generation so what are we waiting for we are waiting for the coming of the lord we are waiting for the rapture we remember I was speaking on the four stages of Ruth actually the only thing we are now waiting for is the reward and he says he's coming down and his reward is with him he's coming down to reward him and those that labored in the field of boys amen how men are waiting for that time and now what is the bride is supposed to do the bride is supposed to rest we are supposed to rest at his feet we are not supposed to negotiate with the Enemy why don't you stand with me on your feet the enemy wants us to negotiate with him you know I wonder here where you stand I want you to just take a moment and think about your life right now and the many times you've tried to attain victory over this and the enemy it would seem as if he has taken away and robbed you of that Victory again and you try again and it seemed as if it slips away and you try again and it seems as if he slips away maybe you've been negotiating with him maybe you've been wondering about what the devil is doing but I want to tell you that today you don't have to negotiate with the Enemy the devil has no legal rights he has no legalized we've had what the word said if if the true church can know who she is and what she stands for she will be an invisible Army now I want to challenge you I want to challenge you and put you to a challenge tonight before we end this service maybe the service was for you this little sharing tonight if you're that person and you say this is a Friday night and maybe I've been tired but I've heard him speak to me you know when the Lord speaks to you you would know you would know that that is his voice and he's speaking to me about this matter maybe if you are here and you would say Lord I'm tired of negotiating with the Enemy I'm not going to negotiate I want to take my stand on the world and believe for this this is the time it is going to happen you know it can happen right now so if you believe we shall pray together Lord Jesus this has just been a a little sharing Lord with your people and talking of your promises in your word and knowing that we are the generation Lord and you are raising our generation father and Ami of of people or that are not going to look back to the failures that are in in their past or in the past of them but they're going to look forward and see the promises Lord I remember when I I read of David Lord as when he came in and he found his brothers all shaking at the sound of Goliath and he was representing that generation that was going to overcome anyhow he was not going to negotiate with Goliath he was just going to come and take what belonged to him father Lord I know that there could be somebody here father Lord in standing in that place standing in that place of David tonight standing in that place of Moses how Moses claimed everything that belonged to him he knew he was in Egypt for a purpose he had been representing that generation that he would not negotiate with the Enemy but would know that look I am here I've come to possess nothing else I've come to possess what belongs to me I don't care the impossibilities I don't care the feelings I don't care what I feel what I've been told I don't care what the doctor said I don't care what Whoever has said but I'm here to possess what has been given to me by my Lord father I pray that they may receive it father Lord may you let that Faith rise up within their hearts to know that you are more than able to come down lord god of glory and your word cannot fall to the ground oh Lord Jesus that they will take their faith and stand on that word and claim what belongs to them and possess it and how and say look I'm not living here without this I'm living with my victory I'm claiming everything that belongs to me I'm claiming my husband I'm claiming my wife I'm claiming my children I'm claiming my healing I'm claiming my victory I'm claiming my healing I'm claiming my Deliverance I'm claiming my job I'm claiming whatever it is that you're claiming believe for it now now maybe you've even never had an experience and an encounter with the Holy Spirit did you know that the moment you believed you can have it why doesn't each of us just have a little moment of prayer and a little consecration before the Lord and just consecrate yourself and say Lord Jesus I just received this and I believe you've spoken to me and I want to exercise this in my life as you live as you will live tonight you just let your uncle be thrown right into the word of God and not to accept anything that the enemy might have thrown to you or to you in your way oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord Jesus may you just calm down lord in our hearts tonight maybe somebody who has a a little complicated situation Lord Jesus a little complicated situation father and they might not even want to share it Lord with but I want to share it with you tonight for you I've remembered them Lord Jesus for you remembering them even now Lord even coming down on their sin right now Lord Jesus and giving them Victory Lord allowing them to experience that power of the holy spirit that we have spoken about oh yes yes Lord yes Lord Jesus the devil says this the devil says that no we will not negotiate we will only focus on what the word has said and we will believe what the word has said for we are an invisible Army the enemy cannot overcome this Army the enemy can try to fight you but he cannot overcome you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world oh yes oh yes oh Hallelujah father maybe someone needs an experienced Lord it might be a Friday night Lord but you walk on every night you walk on every time you don't have a boundary you don't have a boundary Lord Jesus you can move anywhere anytime any place just come down lord in their hearts tonight and move in their hearts oh God give them a grand visitation father shake up their hearts oh God on their souls that they'll realize that you will live in God that you are not dead you are alive today

times I say we have accepted things we we're not supposed to accept because we like to negotiate and give Satan room in our lives but tonight I believe this message is you know is a pinching of the conscience to say Lord something as to give in that something is the devil he's got to give in because we're not living any hope behind we're not leaving any child we're not living in an old person
