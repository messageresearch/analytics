[1:23:02] for Chino so everything we've done it
[1:23:05] has just been to prepare us for this
[1:23:06] moment
[1:23:10] I had a subject the subject I ministered
[1:23:12] on on Wednesday
[1:23:16] so I wanted to continue with that this
[1:23:18] morning
[1:23:21] but since yesterday since actually a few
[1:23:23] days ago
[1:23:26] on my heart
[1:23:30] trying to find the mind of God for the
[1:23:32] service this morning
[1:23:38] you know the way you know the way I know
[1:23:41] what to speak on every service
[1:23:45] is I I receive an inspiration um
[1:23:50] that you can preach on you can take any
[1:23:52] Scripture literally and you preach
[1:24:25] yesterday I decided to just take up
[1:24:28] whatever I had I said I would just
[1:24:29] continue with this subject of course I
[1:24:31] wanted to continue with it
[1:24:36] I titled it the message of the hour I
[1:24:39] mean Wednesday here
[1:24:44] and but this morning
[1:24:47] uh you know I was you know in a place
[1:24:51] and you know listening to something and
[1:24:53] right there it came but then I can't
[1:24:55] remember they said
[1:25:00] the whole thing
[1:25:03] and so what I'm going to preach to you
[1:25:05] this morning came this early morning
[1:25:09] and I realized I I was deeply moved by
[1:25:13] it it's the inspiration of God is
[1:25:20] I pray that you have been in prayer as
[1:25:23] well and that God will bless you because
[1:25:26] how many believe that the Lord will
[1:25:28] speak to them this morning
[1:25:32] if you're seated let us take John
[1:25:34] chapter 3 foreign
[1:25:39] we will read from verses 16 to 22.
[1:25:45] our interpreter this morning is not um
[1:25:57] got transport issues and so maybe
[1:25:59] they'll be coming later today
[1:26:06] sister praise I'm happy to see you I was
[1:26:08] praying for you this morning sister
[1:26:09] praise
[1:26:11] let us read verses 16.
[1:26:17] I hope everybody's there if you're there
[1:26:18] say amen
[1:26:20] for God so loved the world that he gave
[1:26:23] his only begotten son that whoever
[1:26:25] believes in him should not perish but
[1:26:28] have everlasting life
[1:26:32] [Music]
[1:26:42] for God sent his son into the world
[1:26:46] to into the world to condemn for God
[1:26:51] sent not his son into the world to
[1:26:54] condemn the world but that the world
[1:26:57] through him might be saved
[1:27:03] um
[1:27:15] can you read that again
[1:27:17] psychology
[1:27:45] yes so you are the one who is reading it
[1:27:47] wrong yeah
[1:27:51] verse 18.
[1:27:56] give him some little Grace
[1:27:59] he that believeth on him is not
[1:28:01] condemned but he that believeth not
[1:28:06] is condemned already because he has not
[1:28:10] believed in the name of the only
[1:28:12] begotten son of God
[1:28:14] is
[1:28:31] and this is the condemnation that light
[1:28:35] is come
[1:28:36] into the world and Men love Darkness
[1:28:40] rather than light
[1:28:42] because their deeds were evil
[1:28:46] almost
[1:29:02] for everyone that doeth evil hurts the
[1:29:04] light
[1:29:05] neither comes to the light lest his
[1:29:08] deeds should be reproved
[1:29:15] so
[1:29:17] because
[1:29:21] we shall read last verse 21 but he that
[1:29:24] doeth truth
[1:29:26] comes to the light that his deeds may be
[1:29:29] made
[1:29:30] manifests a
[1:29:38] foreign
[1:29:51] I'd like to take myself out of the way
[1:29:54] because I realized a gift is a man
[1:29:57] taking himself out of the way
[1:30:02] you may use the gifts
[1:30:07] that the gift may be a blessing to the
[1:30:10] people
[1:30:12] and father Lord they can also not hear
[1:30:14] from you if they don't take themselves
[1:30:16] out of them
[1:30:18] the greatest enemy to us is ourselves
[1:30:25] foreign
[1:31:03] brother Dixon told me that his cousin
[1:31:06] will be coming here I think you were his
[1:31:08] cousin yes
[1:31:12] so this morning I'm speaking on like I
[1:31:15] said an unusual subject
[1:31:18] and I know I've spoken on a subject here
[1:31:22] and I titled it the Cena's friend
[1:31:27] Jesus the sinner's friend yes
[1:31:30] and if you want to listen to that you
[1:31:32] can go on our podcast on the YouTube
[1:31:34] channel and you will be able to okay
[1:31:38] but this morning I want to speak on
[1:31:41] Cena's die alone
[1:31:45] [Applause]
[1:31:47] you know most of my subjects are
[1:31:50] positive
[1:31:52] most of my subjects
[1:31:55] but this sounds negative
[1:32:00] I don't know how to say it just say it
[1:32:03] the way you say it brother
[1:32:44] does not mean that there was God here
[1:32:46] and there was a sun here
[1:32:50] we know that when he speaks of the Son
[1:32:53] of God he's talking of the Flesh of God
[1:33:01] Jesus was the body and the temple of God
[1:33:03] yes
[1:33:16] [Applause]
[1:34:01] he did not come to the world to be seen
[1:34:13] a little more sound if you can it is so
[1:34:16] sad because I don't want to lose a lot
[1:34:17] of strength it's so sad that in our
[1:34:18] generation
[1:34:22] before us
[1:34:24] so many people have fought
[1:34:27] Jesus came down to start a religion yes
[1:34:32] and I think if they're religious
[1:34:36] let me tell you my friends there is no
[1:34:40] religion that can take you to heaven
[1:34:43] as a matter of fact
[1:34:46] religions there is no place
[1:34:52] greater than religions are going to do
[1:34:56] again because the devil wanna see done
[1:35:00] he shows that people are given this
[1:35:03] thing in them foreign
[1:35:20] [Applause]
[1:36:04] foreign
[1:37:04] restore the broken relationship
[1:37:09] before man and God
[1:37:13] when man sin um the Bible says that they
[1:37:17] uh the the the reward of sin is death
[1:37:22] or the penalty of sin is death
[1:37:26] so when man
[1:37:28] you know it all means man had to die
[1:37:33] this means total separations
[1:37:50] he wanted to be a savior
[1:37:53] he wanted to be a redeemer but he did
[1:37:57] not give that job to anyone
[1:37:59] there is no church can save it
[1:38:53] for our hopeless situation
[1:38:56] and I want to ask you what is sin
[1:39:00] he says when God shines in his light
[1:39:17] are you following me amen
[1:39:37] maybe we read it later
[1:39:41] that he came to bear witness of the
[1:39:43] light
[1:39:46] and he came to bring Sinners to
[1:39:49] repentance
[1:39:59] did they accept him
[1:40:03] answer me now did they receive him
[1:40:06] did I believe him they rejected
[1:40:12] correct that please hallelujah amen
[1:40:17] whoever he says whosoever for God soul
[1:40:20] of the world that is gave His only
[1:40:21] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[1:40:23] him should not perish
[1:40:31] but have everlasting life
[1:40:35] and then he says for God said not his
[1:40:37] son into the world
[1:40:40] to condemn the world
[1:40:43] oh I say hallelujah to that amen Jesus
[1:40:48] yes she did not come to the world to
[1:40:51] condemn the world
[1:40:53] let me say that again
[1:41:11] the purpose of the Gospel yeah
[1:41:41] you are in the image of God
[1:41:43] you are supposed to be like God
[1:41:46] foreign
[1:43:07] God said leave them alone
[1:43:11] and when the moment was right it is all
[1:43:15] the angels in heaven
[1:43:17] did not know what was taking place
[1:43:22] there is something mysterious about
[1:43:24] Redemption
[1:43:27] about salvation of our soul
[1:43:32] no one can understand
[1:43:34] how God can save us
[1:43:38] even today
[1:43:41] they understand
[1:44:04] could he let her
[1:44:07] cry on his feet
[1:44:10] he was right there yeah
[1:44:18] do not explain it
[1:44:20] because saving a sinner
[1:44:25] is a mystery Jama the devil can't
[1:44:29] understand it
[1:44:31] the Angels can't understand
[1:44:35] the Believers can't understand it
[1:44:38] the only one that can understand
[1:44:45] Christ
[1:44:47] if I tell you that Jesus served me
[1:44:50] I tell you delivered me from sin
[1:44:54] you can't understand it but I know
[1:44:58] because it is an experience
[1:45:01] I met him I know what happened
[1:45:10] and I'm not ready to try it for anything
[1:45:15] no one understood it at that moment
[1:45:27] that maybe you know like you know what
[1:45:31] like arms over your body together
[1:45:33] they're just there in the thickness
[1:45:39] of the garden
[1:45:41] and right there and then
[1:45:44] all the Angels started but in just a
[1:45:48] moment
[1:45:49] I want to ask you
[1:45:52] what happened in heaven
[1:45:55] there was something that happened
[1:45:58] God himself
[1:46:08] God himself
[1:46:12] he came down yeah
[1:46:21] Adam had the voice of God
[1:46:24] and when he had the voice of God
[1:46:27] he knew his papa
[1:46:31] I'm asking you this morning
[1:46:34] this is a very unusual service for me
[1:46:38] and please stay put
[1:46:40] foreign
[1:46:49] no matter which situation you are in
[1:46:51] seeing songs
[1:46:52] and at that moment when Adam had the
[1:46:55] voice of God
[1:46:56] that moment

[1:48:20] he didn't want to die
[1:48:24] amen and Jesus
[1:48:27] that was only a shadow
[1:48:30] I say that was only a shadow
[1:48:33] of what was going to come
[1:48:37] when God came down
[1:48:40] was him who saved
[1:48:42] in the same same way
[1:48:45] now in the in in 2000 years ago
[1:48:49] that's not so many years ago
[1:48:52] did you know two thousand years ago
[1:48:56] God himself
[1:48:58] came down to us
[1:49:29] has been spoken
[1:49:34] amen
[1:49:36] you better say Amen because I'm burning
[1:49:39] up this morning
[1:49:41] light has shine
[1:49:44] our generation one more time
[1:49:47] God has come to us
[1:49:49] with a power packed message
[1:50:01] and what does it make us it makes us
[1:50:05] free men for Christ
[1:50:08] free men for Jesus Christ
[1:50:11] this message has set me free for all the
[1:50:15] Traditions
[1:50:18] from all the religions
[1:50:21] you ask me are you Catholic I will tell
[1:50:25] you no are you angry I would say no yeah
[1:51:34] because he has already given
[1:51:54] do I have my brothers and sisters
[1:51:59] so all religions are welcome here
[1:52:04] because we are not coming to make an
[1:52:06] energy
[1:52:08] for sin is unbelief of the truth
[1:52:11] when the truth which is the light when
[1:52:13] it shines
[1:52:16] and Men reject it
[1:52:18] they have rejected the light
[1:52:21] and then you see all these things they
[1:52:25] do
[1:52:27] is not Sin City you call it smoking
[1:52:34] immorality all sorts of immoralities
[1:52:40] adultery fornication or whatever you
[1:52:42] want to call it
[1:52:44] witchcraft hatred
[1:52:48] [Applause]
[1:52:56] they do it public because they have
[1:52:59] refused to walk in the line
[1:53:01] which for sin is
[1:53:06] and so the works of the flesh are just
[1:53:09] fruits of sin it's just sin is reigning
[1:53:11] in your life
[1:53:21] someone asked me are you do you mean to
[1:53:24] say that we all came from Adam and Eve
[1:53:25] yes
[1:53:31] there were only one person created and
[1:53:33] then another one out of here
[1:53:37] so we all sinned we come to the world
[1:53:43] you might be a good man
[1:53:46] and you've never done anything bad and
[1:53:49] you think you don't need savings
[1:53:52] sometimes I preach to people
[1:54:52] you find yourself having hatred when
[1:54:59] you find yourself you know having
[1:55:02] variance and and all these things
[1:55:08] why why because you're born this way
[1:55:12] the way you were born
[1:55:15] by sexual desires
[1:55:19] and that causes you to be a sinner
[1:55:24] listen children of God
[1:55:27] I'm not born according to the lust of
[1:55:29] the flesh
[1:55:33] foreign

[1:55:47] word

[1:55:53] born
[1:55:55] and we are coming after Jesus
[1:56:05] hallelujah amen the Bible says without
[1:56:09] faith it is impossible to please God
[1:56:12] that is
[1:56:14] but how can you receive Faith

[2:01:20] for those who were once enlightened and
[2:01:23] have tested of the Heavenly gift and we
[2:01:25] are made partakers of the Holy Ghost and
[2:01:27] have tested the good word of God and the
[2:01:30] powers of the world to come if they
[2:01:32] shall fall away to renew them again unto
[2:01:35] repentance seeing They Crucified to

[2:02:42] um
[2:02:47] when Jesus Christ was born yesterday he
[2:02:52] was born for a purpose and that purpose
[2:02:55] was that men can be able to repentance
[2:03:00] can come to repent
[2:03:02] that those who are walking in darkness
[2:03:05] we now see a great life
[2:03:08] so he was the light
[2:03:11] came in the midst of darkness
[2:03:14] and now the Bible says he that has been
[2:03:17] enlightened all you yeah

[2:14:34] every walk of the flesh that I read come
[2:14:37] on
[2:14:39] you set fire gamble fire

[2:14:44] foreign
[2:14:49] [Applause]
[2:14:57] [Applause]
[2:15:02] foreign
[2:15:37] and things fire mothers fire drunkenness
[2:15:49] fire all these things the Bible says
[2:15:53] that I told you before
[2:15:57] those that do such things
[2:16:11] the Bible says those who do those things
[2:16:14] forget about the net in the Kingdom of
[2:16:16] Heaven so if you are going to be angry
[2:16:18] be angry with the Bible not with me
[2:16:22] why because they are sinners not
[2:16:26] because they have done bad things
[2:16:29] it is not these things that will take
[2:16:31] you there
[2:16:33] it is
[2:16:47] John 1 6 the Bible says there was a man
[2:16:49] sent from God whose name was John is
[2:16:58] through amen
[2:17:54] there was that was a true light
[2:18:55] you are walking in the
[2:19:15] foreign amen First John 3 8 says he that
[2:19:20] commits sin but I can't show cast
[2:19:23] what is sin
[2:19:26] Achi
[2:19:28] so he that commits sin
[2:19:32] is of the devil alcohol
[2:19:37] for the devil sins from the beginning
[2:19:41] for this purpose
[2:19:45] Son of God
[2:19:47] Manifesto
[2:19:50] um
[2:19:52] why was he manifested
[2:19:56] to redeem sinners
[2:20:01] why did Jesus come
[2:20:03] not to make us get organizations
[2:20:07] how to make pastas
[2:20:11] that is rubbish
[2:20:16] for sinners
[2:20:19] full of souls
[2:20:23] he didn't come to judge them
[2:20:26] he came to serve them
[2:20:32] that he might destroy the works of the
[2:20:34] Devils
[2:20:40] does not sin
[2:20:44] ACH for his seat
[2:20:48] remains in him
[2:20:51] and he cannot sin is born of God yes
[2:20:56] there is no way I can commit adultery
[2:21:03] because I believe the word
[2:21:06] the day I commit adultery
[2:21:11] means I've put Christ again to open
[2:21:14] chairs
[2:21:24] our Prophet preached to someone way back
[2:21:26] and he said people today question he
[2:21:28] said
[2:21:30] um
[2:21:31] a patient laying on a doctor's step when
[2:21:34] a doctor has medicine for the patient's
[2:21:36] disease
[2:21:42] and a patient refuses to take that
[2:21:45] medicine for his inauguration
[2:21:59] but the reason he lies is because he
[2:22:01] refuses
[2:22:10] let me tell you all of you who are here
[2:22:13] I'm speaking this on the authority of
[2:22:15] God's word

[2:22:34] um
[2:22:36] are you hearing me amen as patient sits
[2:22:40] on the doors doctor's doorstep

[2:22:48] refuses the remedy saying and it's the
[2:22:52] same thing in the church church
[2:22:54] now they said right in the view but
[2:22:57] through Allah today and thy Sinners
[2:23:01] they die and
[2:23:03] believersible because there is no
[2:23:06] remedies
[2:23:08] that is
[2:23:11] the people the people's own stubborn

[2:24:40] to others who are just believing
[2:24:45] area
[2:24:48] don't tell me those things of God
[2:24:53] because charges are the most sinful
[2:24:55] blessings
[2:25:09] don't tell me about churches
[2:25:12] they're all the same one they decided to
[2:25:15] go to church

[2:25:34] with all that
[2:26:01] the people who believe Jesus who claim
[2:26:04] to believe Jesus
[2:26:06] have offended the ones who want to
[2:26:08] believe in him
[2:26:11] I saw one church
[2:26:25] he said from today
[2:26:36] I forgive my life to Jesus

[2:26:48] need to leave them just to give your
[2:26:50] heart to God yes in a church

[2:27:00] take it out
[2:27:02] to him what a pastor couldn't preach to
[2:27:05] him foreign
[2:27:58] all the ambition we have children
[2:28:03] is to find Jesus Christ
[2:28:07] ambition
[2:28:09] is
[2:28:14] to be a Beacon of Hope in our generation
[2:28:21] amen that's my only ambition
[2:28:29] you judge have a right to kick me out
[2:28:37] amen and any preacher yeah
[2:28:45] and they take their backsliding
[2:28:48] they try to justify you with the Bible
[2:28:53] they are not different from Sinners
[2:28:57] and seen us die alone
[2:29:07] he wants to serve you
[2:29:13] if you are living in a wrong kind of
[2:29:16] Life
[2:29:18] forsake that kind of Life
[2:29:21] forsake that kind of Life throw it away
[2:29:25] and make your mind up where there is to
[2:29:29] live according to the word of God
[2:29:34] amen

[2:29:39] don't be stubborn
[2:29:44] second Peter 3 9 it says the Lord is not
[2:29:46] slack concerning His prophets
[2:29:52] but is is long suffering to us

[2:31:01] you're just lying yourself you're
[2:31:04] deceiving yourself
[2:31:08] unless you repent of course
[2:31:11] in the message from that time
[2:31:14] a red light flashes
[2:31:19] and he says don't do this little boy
[2:31:26] it's not easy to go to hell
[2:31:32] foreign some of you who thought that you
[2:31:35] will just go to hell easily it is not
[2:31:36] easy
[2:31:39] it is easier to go to heaven

[2:32:20] together
[2:32:25] something happens in you

[2:32:40] gospel songs
[2:32:47] you you light up another cigarette
[2:32:52] and you shake your head
[2:32:55] what are you trying to do you're

[2:33:33] break every body
[2:33:36] they run over everything stop light
[2:33:38] trying to make yourself to go to hell
[2:33:45] and then you say God is good and won't
[2:33:48] send you to hell you are sending

[2:33:52] again
[2:33:54] God says
[2:34:15] you can take your Bible with me and read
[2:34:18] in the Book of Luke chapter 16.
[2:34:22] as I bring this to our clause
[2:34:26] Luke 16
[2:34:30] verses 19.
[2:34:33] there was a certain rich man somebody
[2:34:36] who can read some real good luganda
[2:34:38] please be ready to read for us there was
[2:34:42] a sudden rich man which was closed in
[2:34:44] purple and finally in an unfeared and
[2:34:47] sorry and feared sumptuously every day
[2:34:49] and there was a certain beggar named
[2:34:51] Lazarus which was laid at his gate full
[2:34:53] of sores
[2:34:55] and Desiring uh to be fed with the
[2:34:59] crumbs which fell from the rich man is
[2:35:01] stable moreover the dogs came and licked
[2:35:04] his souls and it came to pass that the
[2:35:06] beggar died and was carried by the
[2:35:09] Angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man
[2:35:12] also died and was buried and in hell he
[2:35:15] lift up his eyes being in torments and
[2:35:17] see if Abraham far off and Lazarus in
[2:35:21] his bosom and he cried and say father
[2:35:30] me and send Lazarus that he may deep
[2:35:35] and cool my time for I am tormented in
[2:35:37] this Flame
[2:35:39] and Abraham said Son remember that thou
[2:35:42] in thy lifetime received thy good things
[2:35:44] and likewise Lazarus evil things but and
[2:35:47] now is he is comforted and you are
[2:35:50] tormented and beside all this between us
[2:35:53] and you there is a great girl fixed so
[2:35:57] they which would pass from hands to you
[2:36:00] cannot neither can they pass to us that
[2:36:03] would come from this then he said I pray
[2:36:06] thee there of our father the Lord send
[2:36:10] him to my father's house for I have five
[2:36:12] Brethren that he may justify unto them
[2:36:15] lest they also come into this place of
[2:36:18] Torment
[2:36:19] now Abraham said unto him they have
[2:36:22] Moses and the prophets let them hear
[2:36:24] them and he said Father Abraham
[2:36:28] but if one one went unto them from the
[2:36:31] dead they will repent
[2:36:33] and he said unto him if they hear not
[2:36:36] Moses and the prophets neither will they
[2:36:38] be persuaded though one rose from the
[2:36:42] dead
[2:36:43] very sad story
[2:36:45] can someone please read for us

[2:36:49] you're not if somebody else can read
[2:36:51] yeah but Isaac you want to help her no

[2:37:15] can you please put on the microphone for
[2:37:18] him
[2:37:20] I want you to listen to this very
[2:37:23] touching story for me
[2:37:26] questions
[2:37:30] [Music]
[2:37:42] foreign
[2:37:43] [Music]
[2:37:52] Alpha
[2:38:13] nasty today
[2:38:22] foreign
[2:38:54] [Music]
[2:39:08] foreign
[2:39:18] [Music]
[2:39:35] [Music]
[2:39:38] foreign
[2:40:15] foreign
[2:40:19] as I bring this to a close
[2:40:21] I want us to look at this man now I know
[2:40:26] that some people take this portion of
[2:40:29] scripture and they try to use it to
[2:40:31] preach poverty my new world
[2:40:37] and say that if you were a Believer you
[2:40:40] know you don't you're not overtaken to
[2:40:43] get riches
[2:40:51] because yours is in heaven
[2:40:53] but you see that a shallow understanding
[2:40:55] of scripture
[2:40:58] Jesus was just giving a parable here yes
[2:41:01] and I want us to understand
[2:41:03] that this rich man uh
[2:41:07] is symbolizes a sinner almost
[2:41:11] the Bible in the Book of Revelation
[2:41:14] chapter three
[2:41:16] he speaks of laodice
[2:41:18] and it says they they think they're
[2:41:21] they're rich and increased with goods
[2:41:28] and have need of nothing but they don't
[2:41:31] know they are wretched they are naked
[2:41:37] so you see it's the situation of the age
[2:41:44] I'm requesting you to stay if you really
[2:41:46] can because I'm just bringing this to a
[2:41:48] cross and I don't want anybody
[2:41:52] be this being the end being told
[2:41:56] of time
[2:42:00] you find that the devil is ready and
[2:42:03] wants to power out all his wrath Satan
[2:42:06] will come foreign
[2:42:28] we see riches
[2:42:30] which we see wonderful things
[2:42:36] let me tell you
[2:42:38] sin is pleasurable HEB chainuma sin is
[2:42:43] fun
[2:42:46] and you cannot be a sin on Earth and
[2:42:49] seen alone
[2:43:54] foreign
[2:44:03] everybody was like oh man this man is
[2:44:06] really
[2:44:06] really yeah
[2:44:13] they call it the babes
[2:44:15] he has all the babies
[2:44:22] [Applause]
[2:44:51] praise the name of the Lord amen today
[2:44:54] is a weekend
[2:45:00] to have gone out to enjoy life
[2:45:04] with many gods
[2:45:07] and sadly very few have gone with their
[2:45:11] wives
[2:45:15] because to them
[2:45:20] it is
[2:45:23] let me tell you this man enjoyed life
[2:45:27] the magic
[2:46:26] foreign foreign
[2:46:33] and when they are old and wacky and
[2:46:36] sucky then they come to God but anyway
[2:46:43] and then you come when you're 40 50 that
[2:46:46] you're looking for a a husband and you
[2:46:48] want to take one of our younger men we

[2:47:01] has served God from their youths
[2:47:11] you you live the best of your life in
[2:47:13] the world
[2:47:16] let me tell you
[2:47:20] foreign
[2:47:52] it may seem as though it is not fun
[2:47:54] Jesus
[2:48:02] you don't have any hope join usury for
[2:48:05] having a good life
[2:48:08] but let me tell you
[2:48:10] why the life the world gives
[2:48:14] but short but I will agree with you on
[2:48:19] one thing
[2:48:20] it is full of pleasure is
[2:48:27] if I tell you it has no place
[2:48:32] that is why some of us yes
[2:48:35] who forsook that style
[2:48:39] we call it sacrifice

[2:48:47] young man of my age to be here shouting
[2:48:49] at you the word of God
[2:48:51] someday
