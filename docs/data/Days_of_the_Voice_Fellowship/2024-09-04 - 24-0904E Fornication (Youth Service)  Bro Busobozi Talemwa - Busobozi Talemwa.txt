service into your in Jesus name amen amen you can give him another clap of Praise amen amen I was happy when I had I was like that sounds like sister peace only only to see that she's a charity I did not know that you know how to sing that's beautiful God bless you appreciator amen wonderful you may be seated for just a moment amen I we have some Empty Chairs here and some young people are hiding behind the pillar we usually you know I'm praying that God will give us our own place soon because this one is Con constraining us sometimes you know you have these pillars and some young people know how to sit strategically where the pastor can't see them and they hide behind the so if you know you are behind the pillar kindly come and use the SE front that will be one if I can't see you you can't see me so I'm requesting you to come anduze these seats right here I'm hoping I'm speaking to those that are hearing amen I'll just give you a moment to do that even sister peace I think I can't see you properly bless Youk those should be your seats always yeah those should be your seats always praise the Lord I see uh most of the mothers and fathers have boycotted our service but I appreciate the uh the mothers that have come God bless you I I want to correct something whenever we say we have a youth service it does not mean others cannot come it means that everybody should come as usual but the only reason why we announce is because we want to let you know we are going to concentrate on that specific group the only services that are exclusive are the married coupl meetings whereby if you're not married certainly you are not going to uh need whatever will be talked about but for the for the Youth Services everyone is usually welcome to come and um also when we organize youth meetings we don't you've noticed that even other people come it's not only exclusive to the youth yeah it used to be some thought that it is only for the unmarried people or for the younger people but um it is for all it is for all because whatever will be shared certainly blesses everybody and some things we talk about cuts across and you find that and figure it out that it is very helpful for so we have um I have um about an hour and I have several questions here that I have that receiv received from those on the youth meetings groupsa and um some from the church now I'm going to request um that you share with me the questions that you have as quick as possible just right now if you have already it just send it come up and help gather those questions and then you um if you have a if you have it written just raise it if you need a paper raise up your hand and then brother Al will uh the purpose for this service we usually have these kind of Youth Services the purpose for it you know is to Target the young the youth um to edify them to encourage them and many times we do it in the in the holidays I think in the coming in the near future I'll be arranging uh uh it's been on my heart for some time especially when I see the need here among our young people and also I see many Ministries that can be a blessing to the youth and sometimes it is difficult to bring all of them in a youth convention or youth meetings that we make because I mean you imagine we have only one weekend inth in a youth youth camp so you cannot have say 10 people or 20 pastors or preachers speaking to young people so we can only have so many so this this year I think we are going to have the most and I'm sure there will be a blessing but I also know others that I've desired in my heart for them to come and be a blessing not only to our congregation but also looking at other churches other some of our churches um you know having these ministers knowing that they can be a blessing to them if you pray God will answer your prayer and we shall start having many youth uh conferences uh where we can invite also from other churches um young people from other churches and they just all come and join us and um then we have you know guest speakers um so that we could make it a bit small uh not like the youth come the big youth come where we camp there for several days so let's pray over that and see how the Lord will lead us but for now I've just been taking these Services you know speaking what God has laid on my heart and I want to believe it's it's been a blessing to those who can hear in luganda we have uh they have proverb which says who is cancelled cannot die cannot perish fully cannot perish holy if somebody has been canell or guided that person cannot perish if someone is going to go if you're going to go and perish it will not because you've not heard the word or you've not been corrected or you've not known what to do but let it be because you just want did not want to [Music] hear the scripture would say that if you see someone in the wrong and you you do not correct them then their blood will be required upon your head but if you see someone in the wrong you correct them and they don't take heed blood will be required upon their own so you see as as ministers as pastors our duty is to teach is to instruct is to preach your duty and our duty as Christians is to take what has been preached and we apply it upon our Liv praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord if that when that day comes and we have to give accountability as preachers especially pastors because the prophet says Pastor is responsible for the people is given to Shepherd is responsible before God he will give an account so I want it to be that when that day comes I will say I did my best I did all I had to do then it will not be upon me if one or two or three did not take heat praise the Lord um I was just saying those comments as I was waiting for the questions still writing uh I think it was posted and everybody knew but [Music] some people like doing things in the last minute now before I approach the questions and answers some of which really doctrinal others um about daily living and others are just affecting the youth directly so we would take all um I preached I want to speak before I go into the questions I want to speak on something little that really I'm not preaching as such I'm just going to State the scriptures for you again I I did go through this uh when most of you students were at school and I want us to go through those scriptures again and then we shall now deal with the question uh 1 Corinthians chapter 6 and by the way I should also say we recently we've had great outp powering of the Holy Spirit here in in the church several Services several weeks I don't know about you as an individual but in my office I've been dealing with not one not two several people that God is visiting to take them to another level now when God visits you how do you know he's how do you know he shakes the foundations the whole building would be like as it's going to break but you would know that the Holy Spirit has come he's shaking the foundation so that they can be established so that the building can be established the stronger wind the stronger the wind blows and and and and sways the [Music] tree it is a clear sign that that tree is putting its roots deeper and so with all these people some of you are here others are not here see they come I don't know really God has been doing things in their it's not we are not taken by surprise I believe that when the Holy Spirit begins to do something work in you he will shake the foundations sometimes it is a life people have lived that has not been right and when the Holy Spirit comes he shakes that puts it on the on the ground he exposes it he cleans up cleans up individuals cleans up life and I want to say whenever the Holy Spirit comes like that and he is moving on your life to put something right you better do it when you have an opportunity you know one thing I I would even say I noticed it was asked in the questions I have I have never believed thank you brother that the Holy Spirit comes to ashame the Holy Spirit does not come to ashame any he's longer suffering he comes to correct you but where you refuse correction then be careful he can literally ashame you before but he is longsuffering he's patient with us wanting none to perish wanting everyone to be right praise the name of the Lord now in this church I um I preach Grace and there are many people even especially Pentecostals who preach Grace but you see the Pentecostals preach Grace and their Grace is disgrace meaning I mean you just go and live anyhow you want it doesn't God grace covers for you now the grace I preach is that it teaches Your Heart To Fear it brings you to know God it it picks you up from the mar clay and pulls you out of sin and makes you come before the Pres so undeserving but you are received by God and and then he begins working on you begins sanctifying begins cleansing and then fills you with the that's the grace I believe that's the grace I preach but I also understand that there are others who misunderstand cuz I mean I know of of people who usually want to preach works but so the service when I'm dealing with young people I like to to discuss the works and today I want to deal with the subject of fornication tell your neighbor fornication yes and I preached on this um in one of the serves flee fornication that's what I'm going to talk about and um we're just going to discuss it really not so much of a preaching so look at 1 Corinthians chapter 6 17 and what questions are we intending to answer we are intending to answer the questions is is it okay for believer to live in fornication and yet and continue to be a part of the [Music] church is it right for a Believer to continue professing Christianity saying God is working on me but they are continuing to leave that kind of Life Is it okay is is it right and if we we c a brother or a sister living that way deal with it okay let's look at 1 Corinthians 6 ver7 um but he said but he that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit we can begin from vers 16 I don't know why yeah what know you not that he which is joined unto anot is one body for two sayith he shall be one [Music] flesh what no you not that which that which is okay vers 17 did I read vers 16 16 okay vers 17 but he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit free fornication every sin that a man doth is without the body but he that commit fornication sinth against his own [Music] body so I've heard many especially in the Pentecostals I know I say this because you will come across it if you haven't already they fornication is not a big deal because you don't sin against God you sin against your own and matter of fact they say that God is Not bothered by it as long as you are mature enough it's your body you decide what you do with it I don't know how many have heard of that and so this verse looks like it supports their idea because it says that he that commits fornication sin against own body but vers 19 says what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in [Music] you and ye are not your [Music] own tell your neighbor you are not your own for you are bought with a price therefore for glorify God in your body tell your neighbor glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are God is you see we are not our own from the moment Christ paid a price he bought us we are his property you are not your own if someone pays something that you own and you take it because it is now yours you use it the way you want it to use it because it is it is now yours it is your property it belongs to you whoever owned it before you no longer has ownership upon it why because they have purchased it from him they have paid the price now the one who owns it uses it the way he desires now when we come to Christ we we we understand that we are accepting that we are B we are not up for sale anymore we are bought already we no longer belong to the devil we no longer belong to the things that the devil made us do therefore the devil has no right to make us do anything or to make us obey him in doing anything he B us soul body Spirit he owns us that is Jesus Christ we are his property the devil has no right to bring sickness to us the devil has no right to make us do things in our spirit or in our body when you understand that you will know you can you as a purchase of his blood you have no right of your own to even use your body the way you want if your owner does not want it that way your soul body Spirit belongs to him the one that b you that paid the price for and therefore here he says don't you know that your body is the temple so he B your you and and you know your soul and then he uses the outer body as his Temple his dwelling [Music] place so now my body is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit I am of God I am not my own I am B with a prize and because of that I should glorify God in my body I should glorify God in my spirit the things I do in my spirit I let me put it this way the things I allow access to my [Music] spirit should be to the glory of God we five senses in our spirit we have conscience we have imagination we have memory we have all these other senses what are they used for they are used as doors you know we can protect it or we can allow all sorts of things to come you see but now when you open your sense your physical sense for example your ears you're hearing you open it to worldly music for example you begin listening to um who singers skin okay tell me tell meu you begin listen to I don't know what would tell West Life music I used to be imprisoned by that myself more than almost more than almost 25 years ago I don't even have the slightest appetite for it I died to it you understand what kind of music beyond music I Believers don't listen to by the way you should not listen to that kind of even listen that is not our portion we are bought with a price we should not open our ears to these things because it influences our spirit and therefore can end up daming us you see you open your ears to to to to those kind of you know music some of it some of that music sounds very innocent very innocent you feel like what is wrong with it it is just talking about day to-day life you know it's just talking and I'm feeling the way feeling it can massage me a bit and because you are you are having a heartbreak caused by the things that you did in the world and then now you want to massage your heart with a music which is sung by someone who does not even know the blood of Jesus that shows what is in you that shows what you're feeding these kind of things should not even be close to us as Believers let me tell you we should clean up the house until you do that you can never receive the Holy Spirit there is no way how can you your house has to be clean it has to be clean for him to come in he says here in verse 15 know ye not that ye are the bodies sorry ye that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of Christ that make and make them the members of anot imagine you sharing a bed with someone who is not your wife with someone who is not your hus allowing someone to touch your body someone who is not not your wife someone who is not your husband you know I've told it here many times countless times about the um the sacred Virtues Of A Woman one of them is your sacred woman yes your body the way you behave around men the way you allow men to behave around you before even they touch you we talking about the way you present yourself to them how you dress is it appealing to them of the world do you know if you're a genuine believer you will never dress to to to to bring yourself in a position whereby you will cat the eyes of those in the world it is impossible I am telling you it is impossible you will dress and they will call you old you will dress and they will call you foolish you I'm talking to you sisters you will not dress to impress them but you see you know these things come in because you dress to impress the world the Bible says we are not of the world we are in the world but we are not of the world Listen there are things that people who are of the world do that we who are in the world but not of the world should never do even if they think or feel we should do them the world does not set trends for the Believers the Believers should set trends for the world that's why the says we are the salt of am I am I talking to someone this and so um here in the book of 1 Corinthians 6 he explains it he says yes you sin against your body but your body is not even yours it doesn't belong to you someone paid a price your body is not yours glory of God you cannot take it and defile it in you cannot do that and still claim to be aie you cannot do that there would be something wrong with your experience and um I know we have very little time but um I would like us to to Tex things from the service tonight which will will can change our life okay look at Ephesians CH 5 be there for followers of God as dear children and walk in love as Christ also has loved us and has given himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling saor but fornication and all uncleanness all covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh Saints [Music] have you heard you you people should be able to say Amen but fornication everybody say fornication all unlean cious let it not be once sa now not only that but also filth foolish talking by the way did you know that Believers don't do foolish talking and they say ah you mean no I was just I was just being I was just fooling with you we don't fool each other we don't do that we are Christians foolish talking or justing you know which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks for this you know that no no unlean person no cous man who is an idolator has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and of God let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of Disobedience so these are the things the world the worldly people are doing and their pastors are telling them just come the way you are and then when they come they begin to bring sermons which Mass them to continue the way they are for us we believe in the gospel that changes you completely you come when you are so sinful you come when you are so immoral no problem come the way you are but if you are sitting under the pure word rather it should change you it must change and the reason why it is not changing you is because you are not yielding yourself but if you really yield yourself how can you know that you begin to yield when you accept you are wrong when you accept you need a change when you really begin to be get concerned what is wrong with me something is wrong with me I must receive something from you know before you get that concern you cannot get a change you will hear good sermons go but you must get concerned and something is terribly wrong with you I need God to do something in me and that something is God filling you with the Holy Spirit you know when God fills you with the Holy Spirit you cannot remain with those immoral appetites we all had them we all had them had Appetit for worldly music some for alcohol others for smoking others for you know fornication imity and things but let me tell you brother you as a child of God when you come to God all those appetites you will submit yourself to the altar I'm not talking about the physical one I'm talking about the alar of the world and you allow God to mold you slowly by slow and one day when you receive an experience that one day by the way is until you yield yourself it's not something in the future it is something in the present heing yourself doesn't take you to you know wait for something to happen I remember when I came to the message you know God had kept me by his grace that I had never been into this kind of lifestyle of the world but but I was in the world and um you know you know was listening to all the music I remember there was a time I came this close to smoking you know I put I I put um a paper together like this because I would see people smoking and began enticing me so I put a paper together like this and put put fire on it and began pulling you know SM I choked almost to death that was the close as I came to smoke and I went to God told him I'm sorry I was young about maybe 8 n years but I remember his grace carried me through that I knew from that moment smokers can die because I almost died I choked almost death but anyways I S listen to the music of the world I still thought dating was okay had you know some girlfriends as much as we were not like doing anything you know I thought it is okay but when I came to this message I began to hear to hear people talk about how come that me I don't have what they talking about it made me to get bothered and I said no no no me I have no problem with girlfriend have sever of them I talk with this one they tell me it is wrong for you to do that said how come how even possible is it to live without a girlfriend how possible live without single single but as they continued preaching as they preaching these things kept on making sense but I realized I came to an understanding and I accepted I did not have what they were talking about you know preachers can talk about something but you have to realize whether you have it or not and if you realize you don't have it that's a good thing it's a beginning of God building something but the problem we have many people presume they have it you have the Holy Spirit yes I have the Holy Spirit but when they know their life is not an overcoming life you can't have the Holy Spirit and live in the life of fornication you can't have the Holy Ghost and Liv in a life of smoking and drinking and all these appetites when the Holy Ghost comes he burns all those filthy he burs them not you but he so we want to have people who are going to Y themselves to the Holy Spirit and the problem with me I cannot stick many times with teaching something and then I end up preaching it but at the end of the day God will have his way we see here that he's talking about fornication and uncleanness andness and um and all these things he says don't be deceived those who are part of that will not inherit the kingdom of Christ so forget about the kingdom if you among the doers of now in first Thessalonians chapter 4 vers 3 he says for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vess in sanctification and honor [Music] hallelujah hallelujah the desire he says not in the last of conscience even as the Gentiles which know not God see cons I don't know whether that's the right pronunciation means sexual desire [Music] so it means not don't don't don't possess your vessel in the last of sexual desire even as the Gentiles don't know godan the people who don't know God that's how they keep their bodies their bodies actually Byam used a word which we don't usually use he said Hollywood has you know presented a woman and made her a sex G that is correct if you look at what is happening in HW all these movies they're bringing out when there is a sin of a man and a woman they don't know each other they never meet each other the moment they meet they are going into immorality they're going into kissing they're goinging and so they present this image before the generation the generation that this is all about a woman this is how a woman is and so they also begin to become so lustful in their eyes and in their mind that's why even when a girl or woman is walking on on the road they will begin calling her Hollywood has undressed the woman and instead of making her dress well modestly they have made a dress what sir [Music] sexy going back to what the brother say this is what reduced a woman to something of no value as something I mean like this woman would go with I don't care how many men and this man would come to her tell I'm not marrying you it's just friendship with benefits is it okay says no problem what a reduction of morality it shouldn't be that way it wasn't that way from the beginning the body of a woman is virtuous because it brings forth life on Earth the very first creature that was able to break those barriers of of a woman's v was the serent and God cast it so if you're going to be among if you're going to also take the anointing of a serpent you will realize you have a lot of CES and you know you do things things are working some of these people even lose their mind they can never stabilize they will be in marriages will you know they will never settle anywhere whatever they doing here cannot see the blessing of God many of them are Christians and the reason why these things are not working for them is because they have taken the mind the world the mind of Satan the mind of the SAT and they can never stabiliz they will become VAB do you know who a vagabond is VAB not having not having stability but you take take your take the Bible and look at the men who were right men who were right in their mind they were so stable they had stable homes these women they had stable homes they they had loving husbands they had loving wives and together they built their home to the glory of God but the world is giving us an option Hollywood is giving us an option but we should not accept that option we should not we don't have to by the way we don't have to because you see the Bible here is saying that we have a vessel that you have a vessel that vessel is your body brother Peter I'm happy to see you today that vessel is your body that vessel is my body but he says this he says every one of you should possess your vessel read that part I love the way he said in English in luganda you should possess your V you should know how to possess your possessing something is taking control over it are you hearing me he's controlling it is being the Lord over it he's being the power over it are you hearing me now the Bible says our bodies we as Believers we should possess them we should control them we should have power over we should not be like the Gentiles who do not know God because they don't know God they live like animals but we know God we should possess our vessels in h we should possess our vessel not in the last of sexual desire but we should possess it in sanctification and in honor you see that's how you know you are in Christ what does it mean also it means your body will never be filled with the spirit your body will always have [Music] those your bodies will always be that why because is born by the L you understand we were born by the of the flesh you know this flesh was born that way cannot be Chang but what does God do what what does Fai in the word do it puts the power of the holy spirit inside your body to the extent that now that power of the Holy Spirit controls your body then you who are you you are the man living in your body you are the woman living in that body now you the man the woman who has the Holy Ghost will possess your body whereby the desires will be there but you will control it that's called The Power of selfcontrol every believer filled with the Holy Ghost should have it I'll be lying to you if I tell you that you'll be so safe that that desire will go it will not go but how can a man get married and live with one woman for 10 years 20 years 30 40 50 Faithfully self control that's the only way that's the only way and you have to control it because if you don't it will control you I control my body by refusing to hug a woman I'm doing I'm having control over my body even when I feel like oh I'm so emotional and I know I'm spiritual I just want to hug this myself then I have to do that because I've been told by my Prophet that no matter how spiritual you are if you are a real living human being and you hug a woman bre touches your are you hearing me you can't remain the same yes you cannot therefore that's why Believers We Don't Hug sisters we don't if you were wondering why that's the reason why in all the believer's churches Brothers don't Huger sisters we are controlling ourselves are you saying when you Huger them you going to go into a no it doesn't mean that it means I am controlling myself I'm having my vessel in honor and in sanctification that's why when we meet sisters we you young men you cannot tell a sister come visit me in my house you don't do that we don't do that as believer we do it we we are presenting our vesses in sanctification and in honor we don't give the devil a chance but you a young lady you go visit that young man and then you say heed me no you did not he you were willing to be a participant because you knew what you were doing you did not present Your Vessel in h Your Vessel must be presented that way in h and in sanctification I've heard of that I can even sh bed you lying it's not true no Pastor you just don't know me I'm Different I am sorry you were born I was born we are all the same and you've heard some people say because they were heart broken men are dogs oh women are those are cast words you should never say those words all men and all women are the same the only difference is a man or a woman who has the Holy Ghost Inside there is no one who is different or better no the only difference is the Holy Ghost receive the Holy Ghost and everything will be different and you let me first read this first Corinthians chap 10 now these things were our examples that and drink and Rose up to play nether let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fail in one day 300 Excuse Me 3 and 20,000 neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were also destroyed of serpents track what what are you reading I'm reading First Corinthians 10:1 no read 6 and N oh sorry so here is talking about whatam you remember it I talked about how God this bam wanted to cast these children of Israel but um you know he could not cast them because they were right with God but the only way he was able to cast them is when he was able to get them into the parties of the world and that was a conduit for them to receive the spirit of fornication that's why Believers we should never be in those parties of nonbelievers I think you heard what I said parties of nonbeliever they could even be relatives even if your parents have allowed you to go you must have limitations you know that's why for us our parties we end Before Dawn before because we we are not going to dance that night we don't do those kind of things our night parties are overnight yes we come here and pray and dance and sing and pray and then go back home that's what we have we do it you cannot go in a night party or in a house party or in a beer party with friends or relatives or whatever that should be a no no no for you that's how you presenting your you're possessing Your Vessel with horon you are we are saying know to mix up but when they invite you you also go after all they my friend I'm just going to just enjoy I will not drink alcohol but I will just drink the you know one one one eventually after a while you learn how to take beer because they take you just take one for a social drink and you know you remember al pastor was preaching and he said it's not a sin to take Al so after all it is not a sinful thing my dear you are on your way to Hell by that kind of Lifestyle you should possess your vessel in hon it is not a sin for me to hug a sister but by not doing it I'm possessing my vessel with horon and then you know they went and they began dancing their with a worldly unbelievers and soon enough night came and all these boys and girls forgot they were believers they enjoyed it they enjoyed it knew it they were doing immorality with them and God was so angry you see by the way the sin of immortal living or fornication Grieves God so much it Grieves him so much to the extent is the only thing that balam was able to do that made God to kill them physically and spiritually and it's the only thing today that would make us Chas a brother or a sister out of the fellowship tell you brother sister if this is your life we cannot part with you your life is unclean now is that even scripture First Corinthians 5 uh 9 I wrote unto you an EP not to company with fornicators uhuh we should even have fellowship with them which company he says to associat you know with sexually immoral people to company with them now he did not say those who were fornicators he say those who are fornicators so if you have been a fornicator and you repent and put your life right repentance is a change of mind repentance is a decision to turn away from those things and stop doing it now people confuse repentance with confession repentance is change confession is saying what you did amen someone if he a fornicator and he repents and he changes his mind he turns his back on those things that lifestyle that is a brother he can fellowship with us but a brother who claims to be one of us and is continuing to live that lifestyle the Bible says we should not accompany ourself we should not associate ourself with such a person he says yet not all together with the fornicators of this world because there many everybody ass out there life but he's saying he's not talking about those all the C of the world all the extortion of the world the idolators for then we must also go out of the world in that case but he say now I have written unto you not to keep Company If any man that is called a brother or a sister for that matter be a fornicator orious anid or a raer or a drun or an extortioner someone who takes people money from people with SE anyone not even to eat with them for what have I to do to judge them that are without I only judge those who are within so you see this message is a message of Grace bring grace to you your life changes you live this kind of Lifestyle but if you having received the message continually leave wrong life then that's when you hear excommunication believe in excommunication do we say Amen to that we believe in it if someone is not accepting to change and their life is not bringing fruits and they continually living like this then we shouldn't even accomp the script is very clear about now how can we avoid [Music] fornication two ways number one which is the absolute is walking in the spirit you can't walk in the spirit until re you receive the Holy Spirit but the Bible says if you work in the spirit you will fulfill the last of the flesh now the works of the flesh are manifest for lasv witchcraft ulations wrath Strife seditions envs MDS drunkenness reings and those kind of things that they do such things not inherit the and the Bible has told us that but if you walk in the spirit the last of the flesh will be there but if we walk in the spirit we shall not fulfill it hallelujah hallelujah now lastly First Corinthians 7 it says concerning the things where of ye wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman neither to avoid fornication nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband so you see even if you have received the Holy Spirit and you are walking in the spirit unless you are un the Bible says to avoid fornication you should get married but if you get married before you begin walking in the spirit even then that cannot be a solution what does it mean before anyone gets married you must receive the Holy Spirit you must begin working in the spirit you must overcome the body the flesh before you even get mared am I am I communicating to someone hallelujah hallelujah so with those words we have a few questions here we to go through quickly and someone um sent me a question I think from the youth meetings group probably they online following it up say uh God bless you Pastor this Brother David I have a question to ask are you supposed to make a public confession of an addiction you have you have overcome for example pornography uh betting most commonly those are you supposed to make a public confession now in answer to this question first of all we need to remove in our mind that it is our works that save us it is his grace that saves us is his work that saves us so then this also goes to before you even put it right before you even overcome it must it be brought to the church must it be brought to the church that oh someone is doing this you have to go and confess it we' we've had churches that do that that if you called doing anything like these things you come and confess it but you see they confess it and remain the same they confess it and it's not confession that is that magically does it it is you finding the power that changes you being filled with the Holy Ghost that changes you now whatever is said or spoken in the church must be to edify the church Philippians 48 says whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely whatever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise then think on these things Romans 19 let us follow after the things which make for peace and things where with one may edify another are you are you are you hearing me all right 1 Corinthians 102 all things are lawful to me for me yes 1023 things are not experienced so the question is is it okay I think it's not wrong if you have a testimony and you want to give it but if it is not going to it's not not every testimony is necessary for you to speak in the church all things are lawful for me all things they defy not it's like you who was a murderer and then you you come to give a testimony imagine me I'm your person I'm talking my testimony I even have a testimony I used to M People I Ked five but God by his gra if I ever call one of you for counseling you will never come because you what so my testimony never defied you you understand so everything is okay it is okay to give the testimony un but it if it doesn't edify it is not necessary for you to in the church um even so as much as ye as zous of spiritual gift sick that ye may excel to the edifying of the church that is 1 Corinthians 14:12 it's all about edifying the church even CH 14: 26 where he talks about interpreting of the tongues or or speaking of tongues or having a revelation or adop you know when it is given in the church it should be to edify the church whatever we speak in the church must be for one purpose to edify the church amen all right so I think I've answered that one now question number two is it also this the same person he says also is it possible to be born again Christian of course filled with the Holy Spirit but yet you're fighting an addiction if yes and you are a minister must you first step down from your ministry or continue until you have fully overcome now I believe you cannot be addicted to smoking alcohol to fornication drugs imal and you have the Holy Spirit at the same time it is impossible you cannot have an addiction and have the Holy Spirit it is impossible and no one should should minister or preach the gospel until they have been filled with the Holy Spirit the evidence of the holy spirit is by believing Every Word by saying Amen to the word but if you are living that life you are not saying Amen to the word you're saying Amen to those things so you're still in agreement with those e fulfilling those evil I read for you a quote here from the message persever and one day this Runway Prophet back on the back side of the desert he really come on them sacred Sons to where every Minister ought to come no matter how many doctor's degree he's got a professor or College of college or whatever he may be he has no business behind the pulpit until first his C on them sacred Sons between him and God alone but he has got an experience with God that no scientist in the world could ever hmer away from him they can take that word and cut it anywhere they want to the devil uses the word and he proved it he uses the word to cut his own program out but when a man has once been back there on them sacred Sons meaning like having an experence where nothing but you and God Alone can stand nothing can take that out of you Jesus wouldn't even let the disciples preach until they went to Jerusalem and they received the Holy Ghost before they went preaching so Brother David I want to tell you that the first thing that this brother needs to do is to receive the Holy Ghost because he does not have if he's still fighting and you know with this of add when the Holy Spirit comes in your life those dark addictions break is a power to help you live above it it's a power to propel you the flesh will not be saved as I told you but there will be a power in you that will help you to live above those addic and until you have an experience with God you should never preach until you have received the Holy Spirit you should not even s you should not even be behind the pulpit until you have been filled with the Holy Spirit why because if you haven't then you not being like the disciples because Jesus Christ told the disciples to First go in the upper and and wait upon receiving the spirit of God it was only after then that he told them now you can go and be Witnesses ah there's much I can talk about someone uh wrote this question I think a sister did not write the name here he said explain John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so sister I can only tell you to go to vers 14 quickly now sister who ask this is not here so you can and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and be and we beheld his glory the only Glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so meaning God is the word the word is God and the Bible says that God DW among us and we beheld his glory he put on flesh he was made flesh and DW Among Us in other words Jesus was God in flesh but before that let be so God and His word are the same thing just like you and your words are the same thing that's why our Prophet told us man is as good as his word people should be better than Japan when you say when you tell someone I'll be there be there let your word tell of your character we should be men and women of character let it not be that when you speak something someone will have to to say let us wait and see whether he will fulfill but I want it to be that when I say something I will do it praise the name of the Lord sometimes it also Catches Us the preachers in minutes in minutes in 10 minutes in 20 and you take two hours said you not as good as your I believe a man is as good as his praise the name of the Lord that's why I've always tried in the church here when I tell you this the last even if I feel I had more to say because I have to H my word God is the same as his word and we found out that the word is God and that word was made flesh when Jesus was born so God was in Jesus so Jesus is God in flesh all right I was then asked another question here is the message totally based on brother Bram is the message totally based on brother bham totally best bam the answer to that question is no it is not even based on brother the message is based on Christ so where does brother bham come brother bham like all God's servants she was a messenger to our generation who pointed us to the word Christ in fulfillment of a prophecy which was given before and I'm going to take five minutes I'll be as good as my word and show you some three four scriptures on this issue quickly open to Malachi 4 verse 5 behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and wful day of the Lord and it shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the c now this is teaching I want you to pay attention Elijah the prophet had already come this we are talking about this the last uh scripture in the Old Testament Mali is the last book but by this time had already come he even went alive to heaven and Elijah came had the of Elijah now there's another prophecy here that elah is coming again before when Elijah would come the prophecy is he will come before the Great and The Dread follow me follow me the great day is the first coming of Jesus the Dreadful day is the second coming of Jesus but here the prophecy is Elijah will come before the great day first coming and before the Dreadful day the second coming how many have got so elah would come before each of those this is not a man called Elijah he speaking of the of another man coming having a Ministry in the power and spirit like that of now his ministry will turn the hearts of the father to the children that is the first part and and the one who comes before the first coming of Jesus will fulfill that and then there's another part before the I mean who will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers that one will will be the one to come before the second coming of jus now before you continue how many have understood that explanation how many have not okay so you're going to give me another five minutes there are two things here this is very important very important we are talking about the coming of Elijah I'm going to okay I'm going to take my time forget about the 5 minutes I'm going to explain this that it will never leave your mind I want four people to come and line up before the pulpit PR Brothers if if you will two four people one is going to represent Jesus Christ first coming okay yeah line up just there yeah just yeah come so that cameras can also see thank you Brothers this is never going to leave your mind I want you to know what we believe so now this one is going to represent the first coming of Elijah uh which is the coming of John the Baptist let me pause there as I told you Elijah had already come elah the how many know him now that man was Elijah he never died he went to heaven Al but this double portion of his Spirit came again on a man called el so those are two Elijah elah and elishah where the two people having that Spirit of Elijah so those had already finished now Malachi is prophesying about what I want to explain that Elijah will come again two more times according to Mal before the Dreadful day the Great and a dreadful day now what does this represent let me go a bit slowly the great day oh I hope you're following if you if you can write WR write Isaiah chapter 61 verse 1 and 2 who knows it of head who knows of head no one okay the spirit of the Lord God is upon me he has anointed me you know the verse now when that prophecy was given by Isaiah it was speaking of the first coming and the second coming of the Messiah come and read it for us you have it there someone has it I want you to follow closely let us give it time we don't always have these moments if we have it we have it let us I hope there's no one rushing yes sister MAA you have the scripture can you come and read it on the microphone someone give a microphone from the Amplified version from the Amplified yes okay the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed and qualified me to preach the gospel of Good Tidings to the meek the poor and Afflicted yes he has sent me to bind up and heal the brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the physical and spiritual CES and opening of the prisons and of the eyes of those who are bound vers two to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord yes the year of his favor and the day of his Vengeance of of our god of our God to comfort all that to comfort all those thank you thank you sister MAA God bless you now follow me closely here friends vers two has the secret are you following vers two says to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord vers that part that portion it is the same as verse one he opened the eyes of the blind he opened the prison doors of those who were in prison he healed the sick ra a dead by doing that he was declaring the acceptable year of the Lord and that is prophesying about the first coming of the Messiah when Jesus came in Luke 4 he read the same verse and he finished here where you see this coma he never continued and then he said he closed the book and everybody looked at him he said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ear what does it mean what he had read for them was fulfilled but he never finished the second verse my God that second verse was speaking about the day of Vengeance it was still the coming of the Messiah day of judgment the second coming Jesus knew his first coming was only the great day to save the Sinners but the second coming will be the Dreadful day to judge the living and the dead how many have understood that now that part is what also Malachi is prophesying about let us go back to Malachi so then Mal says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the Great and the Dreadful day of the Lord okay where is the where where is the great day of the Lord is the first coming of Jesus so it is him this one is the first coming of Jesus uhhuh now this is the second coming of Jesus but before the great day and before the Dreadful day I will send you elij you have understood that okay look closely here you going to be amazed now H in the Book of Luke let us read there chapter 1: 13 but the angel said unto him okay I'm not going to read Because of time but you write Luke 1: 13 to 17 if you can't write you'll go back and listen and then write those now here he's talking about the birth of John the Baptist and there is one thing significant that is said here on verse 17 meaning John this one John he will go before Christ in the power and in the spirit of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children so John is was to come before the Messiah before the great day to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children that's the only thing John did but Malachi says how many things fathers to children children to fathers but John his work was only the hearts of fathers to Children this is not talking about father mother no spiritual significance it is talking about the fathers of the law they said s those ones who were having those long beard the fathers of the law the ones who told Jesus why are you healing this woman John came to turn these people's heart from the law to Christ Grace by doing what by preaching repentance repent the kingdom of God is by accepting that Gospel of repentance they accepted Christ he said the one who is coming I'm not even worthy to Lon is greater than I and said now after baptizing him said I must reduce so that he can increase so John turned the Jews their hearts their FA from the law to Grace that was the ministry of John and it ended there and then Christ came if John did not come according to Mali 4 6 God would C the whole world there had to be someone to introduce the Messiah and when he came then the Messiah came he said behold the Son of God that takes away the of the world he introduced the Messiah and the Messiah now came and he did his ministry for three and a half years and then he went to heaven he died and rose again and then he went to heaven and then for almost 2,000 years the world has been having a lot of things many religions churches people believed on this Mah but eventually they became so denominated so messed up that they forgot the original now in the same SC he says behold I send you the prophet who will do what who will come before the Dreadful day this elah will come before the Dre Day do what to turn the hearts of the children who are the children now who are the children now we are the children we have received the spirit of of God now we cry beloved now are we the sons of God so we are not children of Israel children of God you understand right there in in Luke he was when he was talking about John he said the children of Israel to the Lord God but this one this Elijah is going turn the hearts of the children God to who to their fathers who are our fathers the apostles and the prophets so the work of this Elijah is to turn the hearts of their children back again to their fathers John whenever you read about this John it is talking about prepare prepare something new was coming mesiah was going to be born but whenever you talk about this oneing about restore restore bringing back that which was lost back again so this one doesn't bring new things but the other one introduced all new things baptism water repentance you know new things the mesiah had come everything was new but this one no new thing now read one and then it will open for every one of you okay look at Matthew when Jesus himself is talking about Mali chter 17 verse 10 and his disciples asked him saying why then does the scribes say that Elias must first come why I wish I had time to explain the vers before but maybe what I can say I will say this you know this is the Mount Transfiguration when Jesus had gone with some disciples on the mountain brother then what happened there is um um uh I don't want you to miss this part don't miss this part I wanted to be part of us okay where was I when he had gone on the mountain remember what happened then Moses and Elijah appear and then the disciples saw Moses they saw El do you know what that represents two things Moses was you know Moses died Moses died you know you know that Moses was representing those who died in Christ and elah never died he was representing those who are alive in you know first Thessalonians chter 4 ver 11 he says when the trumpet of God then the dead in Christ shall rise those who are alive and remain shall be CAU up and they shall meet the Lord in the air so now the disciples they saw Moses he never he died they saw Elijah he never di the dead in Christ and those who are alive shall be caught up and they will meet the Lord so they saw Moses El and Jesus he had changed and in a clow so they you receive the Revelation this is the Messiah they never knew until that time they never knew he the Messiah the man is the Messiah quickly they remember the prophets of M do you know why because when John the Baptist came they had missed him they had not known that this man was the Elijah they had not know so when he came for them they they had seen this Jesus and they were here so these are the people here the other is already fulf and they never knew so they are now seeing this one and they realizing is the Messiah so they looked at him so tell us in other words if you are the Messiah why did the writers say elah will come us we didn't see Elijah but Elijah had already they had missed him do you want to know the answer of Jesus is going to explode your mind look at it Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come oh my God you're not getting it did you get it listen Jesus now hey this you saying elij of course Elijah is it future or P you got it it is a future t Elijah truly shall first come have not but follow me El truly first come Jesus is now not talking about his coming he's talking about he's coming and he saying before I come that Elijah shall first come and this one who shall first come he says what will he do restore all things how many got it this Elijah when he comes he will restore all things all doctrines all teachings everything the apost told he will restore he will bring nothing new he will restore all things but when he said that the disciples are still don't understand what he's saying because he has already he's here so what is he meaning and then he Chang the gear but I love it in Ethiopia when we say but that's there it sounds so real he says says I sayto you Oh Brother Sam you are leaving this Revelation where will you find he says but I say unto you listen listen listen I say unto you that Elias is what come already hallelujah how many got it but I say he shall first come and restore all things but I say he has already come and you never knew him and you have done to him everything like you did to all that's when they said the Bible says that's when the disciples understood that he was speaking about but they missed this one even today they don't understand did you get it now so now Jesus himself talked about Malachi 4 in two part fulfilled and the one which was coming so now the other one was John this one is William Bram Bram why because William Bram FS that qualification what that will do when he comes his message will not will not be a new message it will be straight to the Bible he will not preach new things he will preach the old things which the church has rejected he will bring them back again I challenge you this message has no new teaching every teaching of this message is what the old Bible says repentance repentance comes willing to hear to act upon the word it won't be long brother sister you know as long as you do that you yield yourself wholeheartedly you yield yourself heartedly under the power of the word God will F you with the Holy believing unto receiving the Holy Spirit but you see that is something that comes when you have fully yielded yourself to the to God and to allow him to do a work in you you have to empty yourself and let Christ feel you all right question number six is it wrong to pray delete these words in quotes delete my name from The Book of of death and write it in the Book of Life and he says support with scripture Ephesians 1:4 according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love when did he choose us when before the foundation of the world in him before the foundation of the world that we should be what holy Without Blame so my name was always in the book of life before I was even born 1 Peter 1: 18 for as much as ye know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers okay verse 19 but but with the precious blood we were redeemed you can just say this by the precious blood of Jesus as of the Lamb without blaming and without sport who very was fored before the foundation of the world but was manifest was fored before the foundation of the world that was manifest in this last times for you who by him you believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and your hope might be in God even the lamb which washed our sins amen was in him before the found before you ever did any sin you were washed and cleaned in before the found so there is nothing like praying oh God remove this person Sin from the book of death to the Book of Life what are you talking about my name has never been in any book of death there is no book of death at all in the Bible our names have always been in the Book of Life matter of fact for us as Believers our names are in a secret Chamber Of The Book of Life called the Lamb's Book of Life the names of those all those who would be Redeemed by the lamb it was written in the ink of blood canot be deleted it cannot be removed we have eternal security that is a good one praise the name of the Lord all right so there's there's other questions here amen I I understand there's a brother here called Danish is he around he stepped out okay how do I know that this is a a right kind of a woman to marry according to God's will amen very good question um I'm going to read from the from the marriage of the Lamb I have many scriptures and many quotes but I read what comes to for the moment because of time now marriage in one sense is a typ the Earthly marriage is um now let's go over read just for a few moments to rehearse it a moment the first thing that there is there must be a decision man the first thing takes in a natural marriage is a decision has to be made the young lady has to make a a young um her decision whether she wants this young man and the young man whether he wants this young there has to be a decision man and you have to make it she must be the only woman in the world that you love he must be the only man if it isn't then you made a wrong decision now before I continue he talks about a decision here but before a decision also says a man must pray of course also a woman prays but why a man must pray because it is I preached on it last time there a man who has a vision for his home the home he wants to have and that's why it is the man that chooses out of the many what kind of woman he wants what kind of woman will build his future dream the man himself must have a dream kind of home he want to have the kind of family you want to raise and then you know with that dream you go before the Lord in prayer you ask go to lead you and to guide you on who to choose and so the moment you see you know you will see maybe a sister or another and then another thing said that you cannot get one who has everything you've Dre if you think you have I think you were duped somewhere you can't find one has the list that you want I want someone who is brown someone who is tall someone who is having a long forehead and also a long nose I want someone who has a University degree I want someone who has a car someone now you have that that you may even get everything but you find the no is very short all looking very ugly say but this is not I but you can't have all things and you'll get this one who has every physical F you wanted but Spirit zero so then what are you going to do you choose according to your cor values first value must the first one is the character of a woman because it reflects your Ambitions you see she may not have all these educations and allal Futures but she has the character of Christ you clearly see God in her you raise your children let me tell you beauty is good the also says deceptive because Beauty flies away but I agree with you it is good I also not choose an ugly woman but if you want to choose right first don't consider Beauty don't consider Beauty don't consider Beauty my wife is beautiful out but I must confess to you she's not the most beautiful what did you just say it the truth even when I was choosing at that time there are others I saw that probably had better Futures on the but I weighed and I said this one this and this and this and she's the best I could choose in the whole world I'll choose her that is how you choose a woman a wife and then he continues the decision has to be made so when you choose her you don't go you know trying this and trying that and trying that one you know one thing I love from the Scripture it says war mongers and AD God will you better not be judged by God you better be judged here in the Jud conf your sin but God is Judgment has no mercy that's no Mery you go trying this one with every one of that you are choosing if you are choosing no one will even know you are choosing you will do it secretly some of you are making very big mistakes you see sisters and then you begin asking from your friends how do you see that one how do you see that that's the mistake come to your pastor the one who will give you an unbiased spiritual advice the rest will mislead you so sister is not to choose for yourself that one is the one I want and then you begin doing everything possible to get them if they choose someone else it's going to be a problem you don't you don't do that my sister you wait upon God when a brother comes also you've been in prayer brother says you will also choose you have right to choose you choose among those who have come to you not the ones you are looking around the ones who have come to you but he came and almost told me did he tell you no that's a problem on both sides why do you give sister hope and you almost tell and then you don't tell we used to have a sister especially these musicians you people should be very careful a brother was always there in the music department not in this church another church so the sister told us she confided in us this is many it's many years ago so no one will be embarrassed and so she said there is that bre that is about to propose to me we said how do you know he whenever he's playing the guitar and the music is nice he looks at me like I know time he's about to speak the word so many brothers came and the sister chest all of them just all of them and eventually the brother she was waiting for married someone else the sister almost had a heart attack I told her how sure are you is looking at you the people are so many no I always saw him I know what I saw he was always looking at me whenever I feel like it going to f but most importantly attend every Serv your private time you just meditate on his word that's the best way I know to main Amen to stay on fire for what is total forgiveness and how can it be done genuinely I don't know who has asked this question I've preached on forgiveness uh someone help me pull it up if you have it I'm not going to spend time on this one because I've preached on it I'm going to request you to go on our Channel and watch I'm trying to find the day it was preached uh I spoke a lot about it and gave many scriptures and the media Department can you get me the Debs kindly while they find it we can God bless you in case someone mistaken me promised to marry my sister to marry a sister [Music] sister and the sister accepts but without the knowledge of the pastor and parents can it be counted as a vow no as far as I'm concerned that's the only way I can answer that question before God it might be because God knows our heart but before people you have no proof so you cannot lay um even legally say that he promised you because you have no proof that's why you should involve the parents because if you don't you can be duped and someone will walk away with it so as far as I am concerned I cannot consider that unless if otherwise we've assisted to be that now the sermon forgiveness was preached uh on on 23rd June so go and listen to it it will help you so much to know about how how to forgive genuine I want to emphasize these things of AOW our Prophet has told us that a vow has to be made and has to be made in good faith yes in a good faith so how are you going to determine that someone is giving you a vow under good faith without proper both you and them there are many things to consider by the marriage is not easy it's not something that you do on like a debt it is something you must enter into sub the reason we are having a lot of issues people enter into it [Music] unly tell you for sure whether it's been advisably or unvis marriage remains a little bit complicated there will be things that will come up they will shake the the very foundations of if you had entered into it advis prayerfully in the fear of God the chances are that you will sail through all those Str but if you are not considering to be advised and things are going to be tough you need to really enter into advis don't just merely make a vow you know these younger men can be so excited sometimes you know someone just someone I've seen here some of them are here you know they come to say that sister she's the one are you sure I am I am sure have you prayed I am prayed but the way you see someone you tell them continue praying fast some of them I tell them praying for two months come back to me some of them come back I think it was my then you are wondering I thought you told me so you see why you need the pastor you need to be advised you are accepting you seeing someone who excited like for sure this is this is the m best and then all of the sudden you realize that it was not a genuine desire so you see how why you need to go to put God in your marriage plans God bless you Pastor I remember one time in your preaching you say that everything has a beginning has an end but then I heard another preacher saying that God wasn't God before he created us to worship Him does that mean that God has an end I also said that here both phrases have been spoken by Brother Bram it is him who said that everything that has a beginning has an end it is also him that say that God wasn't there was a time that God wasn't both myself and that preacher are quoting the same Prophet so we are not fighting against each other what I can say your question is does it mean that there was a that that does that mean that God has an end whatever has a beginning has an end in our understanding what is God in our human understanding what is God yes and therefore he can exist he existed before the creation exist after the creation it's not about his person it's about his creation and uh when it comes to his title as a son you know because God even as a son is has dispensations [Music] son of man Son of God Son of David and each of these has a dispensation and it will come to an end and the scripture says that when he has put all enemies under his feet then he himself is talking about the Son of God become subject to the father so you see whatever had a beginning has an end that's why you cannot say he's an eternal son says Eternal Father etal Son there is only one who is a and that is God but when we say God is before and after creation he himself has no end he has no beginning of you know even actually it is spoken of when it's speaking about MC and when it is talking about Christ talking about his priesthood can we read it somewhere here Hebrews chapter 7 vers um one for this mized king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all you know we ptie to God you know this first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually you can read it for [Music] praise God whether there is one to worship him or none to worship hims God is an object of worship whether he not being worshiped meaning when whether he not God oh that's what it actually means when we say God it means object of so he was there was a time when he was not being that means there was a time when he was not G right but he still he still was so whether he's being woried or not he's God we use the word God because we have no words in our vocabulary to explain but God is what can explain before us and after us whether we exist or whatever he remains let me say he remains who he with that father with that mother they said Mary Mother of God God has no mother without beginning of days and without end of life you are God from beginning to the end praise God God bless you Pastor my question is in the scripture Matthew 243 who are these elects I thought we shall already be with the Lord let's look at it right quick Matthew chapter 24 vers three and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the beginning of the temple and Jesus uh said unto them see ye not all these things where I say unto you that there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he sat upon the mountain of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the and of the end of the world is that 31 Matthew 2431 vers 31 okay and he shall and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from one from one end of from one end of Heaven to the other okay can we begin from vers 27 for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be for whatsoever the carcass is there shall the Eagles be gathered together immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the son be darkened and the moon shall be uh shall not give her light and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of the heaven shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great glory and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from end from the from the from the end of Heaven to the other so now we notice here is speaking of um when in verse 30 it says and shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great Glory can you read that in Uganda uh uh 29 actually brother bam does speak about this in the 6th seal if you go to the Sixth Seal um he talks about it and we understand the Sixth Seal is the Tribulation period uh because because by this time the bride has already gone but we understand there is also the elect from among the Jews because the 144,000 are not all the Jews they the elect from among this is not speaking of the bright then it says I have found many women preachers standing with scriptures like Mark 131 Mark [Music] 131 okay and he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up and immediately the fever left her and she ministered unto them can you read for me Matthew 25 2755 have you seen that um and many women were there beholding a far off which followed Jesus From Galilee ministering unto him and so the question is how were they then ministering to Jesus you know also let us read fon you know people blow scripture out of perspective let us read filon 13 umon filon 13 filon is just next to Hebrews or rather before Hebrews behind Hebrews after Titus it says which okay I can begin actually reading from vers 8 wherefor though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that that which is convenient yet for Love's sake I rather be be SE thee being such an one as Paul the Aged and now also a prisoner of of Jesus Christ I beseech thee for my son onesmas whom I have begotten in my bones which in time passed was to be we find that there have been many people not only women that have ministered to ministers in the bondes of the Gospel if you want to see a very perfect example you will look at the shite woman and a man of God and even Elijah and that woman you know how you know she got a place for him minister to him by maybe giving food or taking care of physical things there have been women like that in the ministry from the very beginning you know so this is also how it was in The Book of Mark 131 these women were not ministering by preaching they were ministering to the ministers in the bond of the Gospel Paul had them Jesus had them even us we have them women who are always behind the scene actually women many women actually every Ministry you'll find there are many women sometimes they they are praying some of them are giving a lot of money others are you know doing things behind Somey clothes just wash the clothes when I was in Ethiopia you know this woman that really minister to us uh myself and my wife and when my wife was here in Uganda when with another brother she really minister to us she would come and cook you know so those women were ministering that way not preaching okay so that that can be clear so Peter's Peter's mother-in-law ministering by taking care of the men okay how many Heavens do we have and some light about them like I heard that brother bam went the third heaven and found his wife and daughter there so how many Heavens do we have Enlighten more about the foolish virgins and wise virgins [Music] [Laughter] okay and also it says um uh they want to get clarification of [Music] the all right so I just want to maybe give you a little bit of a for test of this not going in the details can you open in your Bible in the book of second Corinthians chapter 5 we read verses 1 to 4 we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens can read for in this we grown honestly Desiring to be clothed upon with uh our house which is from Heaven if so be that being en closed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do grown being burdened not for that which would be not not not that would be unclosed but closed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life but so we could also take other scriptures like in the Book of Genesis where he talks about h you know in the beginning God created what he created what you're not answering what did he create Heaven and Earth okay so is are this talking about the second the same Heavens so there is different Heavens when we talk about the sky the Earth is atmosphere we call it heaven but there is also another Heaven that's the Galaxy people people did not know they found it out recently that there is actually [Music] more planets that others have been discovered others have never been discovered so when it says God created heaven heaven is large that's our second heaven the Galaxy but then in the third heaven is where the Believers go um it's a Celestial in what you would call the celestial Paradise it used to be that we were when we would die before the resurrection of Jesus Christ then we would we would go uh down in in in hell this kind of paradise used to be a portion in hell but when Jesus rose again from the the Believers now don't go to hell when they die those who die not in Christ they suddenly go to hell in the regions of the dam go there but now the Believers when they die they go to that to that Celestial Paradise they go to heaven but this is not where God is also but then that that you would call the third heaven this you would call the third heaven where the Believers go that's where brother bam would find his other this is where all of them are but you see after after that you will find that there will there is um uh the real of angels another dimension and then after that you'll find another dimension where God himself is so even those who are dead in Christ they currently not with God they are waiting just like we waiting when he comes when the tapet is blown and at the last of the then the dead in Christ those who are in that third will come and then we will be changed and together we will meet the Lord in the air he says that I Enlighten more about the foolish virgins and the wise virgins the foolish virgins don't receive the Holy Spirit even they claim to have beli the word but they don't receive the Holy Spirit and the wise virgins receive the holy spirit that is the biggest distinction between [Music] them that's why it is a must for you to receive the holy if you don't receive the Holy Spirit you you are risking you might end up remaining the foolish virgins go through the tribulation The Virgins are hairs to eternal life does that make sense I've preached on it here before their hairs to eternal life they will get eternal life that's old they will get but the bride gets more than eternal life she goes in the Rapture she goes in the Millennium you know she goes in the marriage supper is then in the millennium then also has eternal life of so that's the difference and we are the wise virgins the bride okay I hope that is also sufficient now why should we P this must have been a very frustrated person praise the Lord but I think it's a good question we I just read for you here in in the book of Hebrews where he says Abraham paid tith vers 2 Hebrews 7 Abraham is the father of of our faith and he paid TI because he was a Believer all those who are believers in God they P TI God as a recognition that all the blessings that you receive from God and you always everything to him you know someone told me recently I thought you paid TI on only Sly and never ear Sly so I what about the ones who do business what what about the ones who never really have Sal as as long as God blesses you with something income you have to pay could be a gift could be something that you have received from you TI it because it is an income something that has come to and um I'll just give you an answer directly from the scripture Malachi 3 says vers 8 will a man rob God yet he have robbed me but ye say wherein have we robbed thee in TI and offerings he are cast with a cur for you are robbed with you have robbed me even this whole nation bring all you bring you all your tis into the storehouse there may be meat in my house and that prove me now here with a lot of if I not open you the windows of heaven and power you out of blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive so if you want a blessing God said test him by paying your TI and by giving offerings but the question is why come of it but why do weay in the Old Testament was paid by all the tribes to the tribe to the tribe of Le and these were the priests they did not have any land they were not doing any job they were only attending to the altar to the word of God and so God said to the others you have all the uh Fields now you cultivate go work labor and all the ties that one is mine and then he came this side he said the Levites that is my tribe I'll take care of it so then he says where is my 10% give it to me bring it to the L let them take care of it on my behalf so this was God's reward to the Levites to be able to run the work of the temple so it is the same thing today it never changed that God when when it comes to rewarding labor to rewarding those who serve in the work of the ministry it still requires the Believers to pay TI and if you pay your tyes they help the pastor they help the preacher to continue preaching to you oh Pastor where is that in the Bible how many want to see no one okay all right let us go in our Bibles and uh read about that okay Romans um well we can read 1 Corinthians chapter 9 ver um 11 yeah can read from 11 really it begins from up there but um let us begin from n for it is written in the law of Moses that thou sh not musle the ox the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn do God take care of for o oxen oh sayth he eat all together for our sex you know he's talking about the ox that digs he says don't don't tie it mouth when it is don't mistreat it when it is digging for you says does he really talk about the oxen or is meaning us the people for our sakes no doubt this is written that he that plowe should plow in hope he that plow should plow in Hope and that he that threshes in Hope should be partaker of his hope imagine brother Brian you go somewhere they give you a house to paint you happy you begin painting and when you are done child God bless you thank you really after all this work you will be shocked you'll be surprised in the same way he says he that works should work in Hope if we have sown unto you spiritual things is it a great thing that we should also reap canel things matal things he studies he after go he doesn't even have time to go for a job somewhere and people are calling him throughout the week meeting this one and that one and at the end of the day you earn your salary and there's a TI for what really when the whole week you are very busy disturbing the pastor calling him at midnight oh pray for us but you can't pay 10% the Lord to help the pastor he said if we have sown to you spiritual things is it a great thing if you should reap your kind of things so your Tye is is being raped by somebody who is showing to you spiritual if others be partakers of this power over you are not we rather so Paul was teaching something he said it is okay but for he as a man he was an apostle he decided he will not use it and people were not collecting or giving to you but he said it is obvious if someone labors if I have a minister come here like if I have usually ministers who come and when they preach don't think I just tell them God bless you because it is taken that they came to support my Ministry so I must also reward their I don't just tell God bless you go in no we all appreciate it and we put we usually put something here collect some usually I even add so that someone can it can help them so that's how it has to be so our paying of our tithe told us it does not go to building of the church it does not go to Renovations that one goes to the preaching Ministry it goes to the pastor personally I don't even use tithe I use it to support the ministry but however it is used it should be used to support the preaching Ministry and that's why we pay TI and that's why we must pay tith if you are not a tith payer you not robbing me you're robbing God Amen Pastor I'm this is the last one I'm finding uh I'm finding which ones is the first Exodus second ex Third Exodus the first Exodus was the children of is leaving Egypt going to the promis the second Exodus was uh uh what was the second Exodus somebody help me huh yes oh yes yes thank you the second Exodus was from the law to Grace the Third Exodus is what is going on now from denominations to Christ so we are in the Third Exodus which one are they two brids that Prophet talked I can't understand what this brother wrote or sister I think it's a brother the ones they the ones who write badly like this which ones are they two Brides that Prophet talked about I don't understand your question I hope I don't know what you mean but there's only one bride only one if you here and you ask this question and you want to clarify you can raise up yes are you the one who wrote this okay can someone can someone can someone give her the microphone okay thank you Pastor um we are reading today the church edges and then uh there is something that the prophet had said somewhere there about uh that the the two the two brids who were deceived so I was wondering is there another one who is the first which message was that Pam Church how can you tell the spirit apart just give them the word test if they don't speak that word they are of the evil one as the evil one deceived the first two bright he will try to deceive the Bride of this last day by trying to get had to hybridize herself through Creed the first bride who was deceived was Adam's bride and you know in Eve she was deceived according to First Timothy chapter I think three uh we can get that right quick here first Timothy chapter I think two [Music] um vers 14 and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression so the first Eve was deceived then the second Eve who was the church who was supposed to be the bride of Christ also got deceived um and you know went into denominationalism and so now Christ has his own elect in this last day that has called out out of the church system which was deceived and this one won't be deceived by Creeds and dogmas and hybridization of denominational doctrines and things she's going to be a perfect bride without sport without rink BL well God bless you it's been a wonderful session has it not Amen Let Us stand up maybe the musicians can come we sing a song or two and then we [Music] close
