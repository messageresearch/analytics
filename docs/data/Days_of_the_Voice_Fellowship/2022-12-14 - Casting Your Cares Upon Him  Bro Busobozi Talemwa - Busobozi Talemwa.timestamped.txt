[17:56] seven championship
[18:14] first Peter 5 uh
[18:17] six and seven but it is
[18:23] and we are reading in Jesus name
[18:26] [Music]
[18:30] humble yourself yourselves under the
[18:33] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[18:36] in due time

[19:34] noticed that today
[19:37] foreign
[19:40] you have come late
[19:44] all of you
[19:46] and so I can see you have a lot of chaos
[19:51] a lot of things that you are going
[19:54] through the military
[19:56] praise the name of the Lord
[19:59] amen mean
[20:04] yes I I have a note here there's a lot
[20:07] of cares
[20:32] I mean
[20:34] um
[20:35] casting your cares upon Him
[20:42] a friend in the time
[20:53] I will not belong as usual on Wednesday
[20:58] but I've been so much burdened
[21:01] to speak on this subject
[21:06] and I'm going to begin with a quote
[21:08] which I sent one of us and it was at a
[21:11] time that was uh a bit difficult for
[21:14] them
[21:28] but tonight I'd like us to talk about
[21:32] casting our cares upon the Lord
[21:36] why you
[21:38] know
[21:39] all of us here have cares if nobody
[21:43] wants at one point or the other in our
[21:46] life
[21:46] [Music]
[21:48] all of us have problems
[21:51] we go through things
[21:53] but here the prophet says in the message
[21:57] the mighty conqueror
[22:02] and the pressure is what he is
[22:08] when he is under pressure
[22:12] have you ever been under pressure raise
[22:14] up your hands can you go
[22:16] now
[22:18] we can see you now smiling
[22:21] we can see you speaking with your
[22:23] friends
[22:24] we can see you laughing but that's not
[22:28] really you now yes
[22:30] the real you oh yeah is when you are
[22:34] under pressure
[22:35] is when you are going through a tough
[22:37] time because
[22:39] when things are not going as you
[22:41] expected to go
[22:43] is when you don't have any money in your
[22:46] pocket
[22:47] when you you you have undergone a
[22:51] certain difficult situation
[22:53] [Music]
[22:54] is when you are going through problems
[22:57] is when you are down in the valley
[23:00] that is when we know who really you are
[23:06] a man is under pressure when a man we
[23:11] know a man when he is under pressure
[23:15] his real true characteristics
[23:26] [Music]
[23:59] to see whether there is any flaws in
[24:02] them
[24:04] I remember when we used to be in school
[24:08] especially high school and also the
[24:12] elementary
[24:14] primary you know you people would be
[24:17] there some of them they don't want to
[24:41] those who behaved as if they knew
[24:43] everything better than everybody else
[24:45] [Music]
[24:53] and you know before the government
[24:56] intervened to say that we shouldn't beat
[24:58] children government
[25:01] I remember that we had a teacher his
[25:03] name was Mr walakira
[25:07] to come after the exams have been given
[25:12] and the results are out
[25:15] so he would come with a big Road in the
[25:17] class
[25:18] [Music]
[25:20] Hallelujah I think brother we understand
[25:23] you need someone needs to help him
[25:25] listen to to make it a very good sound
[25:27] okay so and he would come with this road
[25:31] and then he would say
[25:34] anyone who is below below 60.
[25:42] I'm facing it rough today
[25:45] I'm going to give you 10 of them
[25:49] and he would even tell you a day before
[25:53] [Music]
[25:55] I tell you I'm marking your exams
[26:00] and I'm coming back soon
[26:04] I'm bringing your results
[26:07] anyone who is below
[26:11] and not none of you have even from what
[26:14] I've marked so far
[26:16] none of you is even above 40.
[26:20] anyone who is below
[26:27] and so precious would begin to go up
[26:32] precious will begin to go out
[26:35] everybody was worried because we did not
[26:38] actually know
[26:41] how many you scored
[26:44] but those of you who knew that I tried
[26:47] my best
[26:49] you know they were a bit calm and those
[26:53] of us who trusted in God
[26:56] said anyway the day will come and the
[26:58] day will go now
[27:01] so we will not get worried
[27:04] praise the name of the Lord I'm sure
[27:06] that most of you went through that
[27:09] but you see in life
[28:02] so now our life really human life is
[28:05] full of a lot of pressure
[28:09] but here what
[28:12] tonight
[28:13] what I'd like to talk about
[28:16] how should a child of God behave under
[28:20] pressure
[28:23] when you find yourself when your back is
[28:26] against the wall
[28:30] you know when you find that you have no
[28:32] hope
[28:34] what are you going to do again to cause
[28:37] a child of God
[28:38] praise the name of the Lord during times
[28:42] of distress
[28:52] when you have wants and needs
[28:56] you don't see anyhow you're going to
[28:59] meet them
[29:01] you need money and you clearly do not
[29:03] know how you're going to get it wait
[29:05] again
[29:07] and maybe your business is no longer
[29:10] working well
[29:12] maybe you've lost a job
[30:12] we can talk about
[30:19] [Applause]
[30:57] [Music]
[31:10] and I tell you people often do a lot of
[31:13] things
[31:19] you see
[31:21] you have a word
[31:31] you need to find comfortable
[31:36] you need to find consolation
[31:39] but you are confused you are distressed
[31:44] to emphasize this so we can understand
[31:47] you are heartbroken foreign
[32:01] right all of us here for normal you have
[32:03] been there before
[32:05] praise the name of the Lord people what
[32:08] did you do
[32:10] when you were in such times
[32:14] all of you can speak what you did but
[32:17] your mind
[32:18] mostly people cry
[32:25] what is wrong with you
[32:34] what if I can express what I'm feeling
[32:38] but I can't express
[32:43] when someone asks you what is wrong
[32:51] because we are going through a tough
[32:53] times
[33:03] as if someone has put them on a steroids
[33:09] how does they get angry you know you
[33:12] just talk to them
[33:15] they just sit back at you
[33:18] then you know I think he's distressed
[33:24] right I mean others they disappear
[33:28] or they forsake their responsibility
[33:32] find a father because he has no money
[33:36] we have many of us in our generation
[33:39] they leave the family there
[33:42] they disappear interesting
[33:50] because of what they're they're going
[33:53] through
[33:54] in their life they disappear my father
[33:59] was one that did that
[34:01] a lot of things that this distressed and
[34:04] depressed
[34:07] and he collected all of us in the home
[34:10] I am the fourth of five children
[34:14] and he said wherever I've taken you in
[34:17] school
[34:20] that's the best I can do
[34:23] [Music]
[34:24] now all of you when now you need to fend
[34:28] for yourselves
[34:29] and he disappointed us he left us with
[34:34] our mother nature they disappeared into
[34:36] things
[34:38] Allah saw him I last had my father in
[34:42] our home when I was 13 years old
[34:48] that's where I had to grow so fast
[34:55] and we have a lot of families like that
[34:58] we have a lot of children like that
[35:01] most in our society they've been for
[35:04] seconds
[35:06] why because they are fathers or their
[35:09] parents or their mothers they were
[35:10] depressed they were distressed they were
[35:12] in need they were in confusion
[35:18] who are thrown into you know garbage

[35:34] and distressed and confused and
[35:36] heartbroken
[35:51] they will find consolation they will
[35:54] find a peace of mind
