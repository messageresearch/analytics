[45:42] Grace just yield
[45:44] yourselves to the
[45:47] word and to give you
[45:50] life can we go to Timothy chapter second
[45:54] Timothy chapter 4:7
[46:17] second
[46:23] Timothy chapter 4 verse 7
[46:32] can we
[46:34] read uh
[46:37] here in in verse S it says I fought a
[46:42] good fight I've finished my
[46:45] course I've have kept the
[46:48] faith
[46:50] amen this was
[46:52] Paul he was tell he was telling
[46:57] toothy because he was
[47:00] handing he was handing over to Timothy
[47:05] Hallelujah yeah this evening we shall
[47:08] take a small little
[47:10] context it says setting an
[47:15] example
[47:17] Hallelujah as we have read here in the
[47:20] word you can see you can take your
[47:24] seats as you have read here in the
[47:27] word Paul was telling Timothy I fought a
[47:31] good I fought a good
[47:33] fight I finished my course have kept the
[47:38] faith in other words
[47:41] Paul was like an example to
[47:46] Timothy he was telling him you see what
[47:49] I
[47:50] did it's the way to
[47:54] go these examples are still living up to
[48:02] now Paul fought a good
[48:06] fight in his
[48:09] generation but we're also fighting right
[48:12] now in our
[48:16] generation brother Bram said he preached
[48:19] what Paul preached he said what Paul
[48:24] said he's out po right now
[48:28] he's telling the bride I fought a good
[48:30] fight we believe he fought a good
[48:34] fight so it is now to
[48:38] us those people set good examples to
[48:43] us that we have to follow right
[48:47] now though very many things are coming
[48:50] up very many Creeds and dogmas coming
[48:54] out by men who call themselves spiritual
[48:58] men spreading wrong
[49:00] news because of having a a big
[49:05] crowds people may think they they are
[49:08] the right
[49:09] people to guide them in this path but
[49:13] this this is the right way to
[49:17] go what Paul said is what we
[49:22] take what did the apostles say it's what
[49:25] we take Hallelujah
[49:29] there's no any other thing that we are
[49:30] going to
[49:32] take because the Bible says Paul was
[49:37] preaching he said if any
[49:40] Angel comes and changes
[49:45] anything let him be
[49:48] casted an angel is a
[49:53] Messer even our pastors that you see
[49:56] maybe the ones
[49:58] that the the word Angel was just was
[50:01] just sending in for all the the
[50:06] ministers even the the the called
[50:09] ministers the people called and the on
[50:13] the ones that called
[50:19] themselves so the the change some are
[50:22] changing what is here
[50:27] they're not Keeping the Faith right now
[50:30] they're not directing us fight a good
[50:33] fight
[50:35] Hallelujah but from the beginning God
[50:38] came setting
[50:41] examples that we have to
[50:46] follow in every generation he said
[50:49] examples in our generation he said
[50:55] examples but as we read in uh in Hebrews
[50:58] chapter 8 verse3 it says Jesus is the
[51:02] same
[51:04] today yesterday today and
[51:08] forever if he set
[51:10] examples back then the generation of
[51:14] Paul the generation of John wisley the
[51:16] generation of all the angels that he
[51:20] sent the all the prophets he sent is
[51:23] also setting examples right now
[51:26] we are living examples right
[51:32] now because if you set examples in those
[51:36] ages they may not have lived in the same
[51:38] life we are living right now they may
[51:40] not have experienced what we
[51:42] experiencing right now but right now we
[51:45] have the people who are experiencing
[51:47] what we are going through and are
[51:49] setting
[51:53] examples in this world we are setting
[51:55] two examples because this world is led
[51:57] by two
[52:00] Powers everything runs on two
[52:04] things as you even see in the
[52:07] Bible God created a male and
[52:12] female even as we we studied most of us
[52:15] have gone schools we started opposite
[52:18] the opposite the the the things that are
[52:20] about
[52:23] opposites they always two things there's
[52:26] a boy there's a girl there's a woman
[52:30] there's a man there is God there's the
[52:38] devil there is
[52:41] truth there's
[52:44] false all those are setting
[52:50] examples you may be setting a right
[52:53] example or a wrong example
[52:56] it's up to you to what example you're
[52:59] setting right
[53:01] now to the
[53:04] generation you're you're living in right
[53:08] now very many people we see have set
[53:12] good
[53:13] examples to their Generations but we're
[53:16] also setting right now examples we also
[53:19] being Witnesses right now the examples
[53:21] that we are setting are the ones that
[53:23] going are the ones that are going to be
[53:25] the the witnesses we we as examples are
[53:28] going to be the Witnesses on that
[53:31] day if you say that something was so
[53:34] hard for me they will bring for you
[53:36] someone who had overcome who went
[53:39] through this you may say ah po is not in
[53:42] our generation he may have not faced
[53:44] what we fac he may have not seen the
[53:49] internet but they will bring you someone
[53:52] they will bring you a
[53:55] bride who went through what you went
[54:00] through God is so
[54:04] just some people may think that they're
[54:07] facing a lot than other
[54:09] people but we are all going through the
[54:12] same
[54:14] Hallelujah but it's up to you setting an
[54:18] example set an example in your
[54:22] generation be that
[54:24] witness that will say I fought a good
[54:27] fight that your brother and sister can
[54:29] despy about
[54:31] you like tabi when she died most
[54:36] Believers are to cry because she she had
[54:39] set a right
[54:42] example she was a good sister in the
[54:48] church she said an
[54:51] example we also have to set examples
[54:59] if you're not setting a good example
[55:00] you're setting a bad
[55:03] example if you're not spreading a good
[55:05] thing you're spreading a wrong
[55:08] thing that's it you cannot change
[55:13] that then if you feel that you you're in
[55:15] the middle God
[55:17] says those are feel those are are a warm
[55:20] and not warm he will spill them out of
[55:23] his mouth that means that is a noo Zone
[55:26] you cannot be between
[55:30] something so we are setting an example
[55:33] right now
[55:38] Hallelujah can we read also in
[55:53] uh uh in Romans chapter 8
[55:56] verse
[55:58] 31 it
[56:00] says what shall we then say to these
[56:04] things if God be for us who can be
[56:08] against
[56:10] us as you setting an example in this
[56:13] world there's a lot of
[56:15] critics there's a lot of people that
[56:18] will speak there's a lot of people that
[56:20] will laugh at you that may think that
[56:22] are they good they better than
[56:24] you there's a lot of people people who
[56:26] will say you cannot manage but we have a
[56:30] God he said he will not leave us he's
[56:33] always besides
[56:36] us
[56:39] hallelujah who can be against us if God
[56:42] be for
[56:44] us though the storms
[56:47] rage those situations come as tough as
[56:52] nothing he has sa is always with us
[56:56] nothing will be against us if God is
[56:59] with us they may fight against us but
[57:03] they will not
[57:05] overcome
[57:08] Hallelujah yeah we have a lot of things
[57:11] that have written up people's minds that
[57:13] have eaten up Christians
[57:15] Minds people are always leaning on the
[57:18] negative
[57:21] side negative things have always taken
[57:24] up people because you see a very very
[57:26] many people are taking up that root
[57:29] you're also taking up that root that
[57:31] setting examples for
[57:33] you yet you all set an example as a
[57:36] Believer
[57:38] Hallelujah even in
[57:43] church be mindful of the examples you
[57:47] take because in church we have three
[57:50] kinds of believers
[57:57] to be able to know the right example to
[58:02] take be baptized with the Holy
[58:05] Ghost just receive the Holy Ghost you'll
[58:09] know the right example to
[58:11] take you'll know the right people that
[58:13] will motivate
[58:15] you but if you miss out that I don't
[58:21] know Hallelujah
[58:26] yeah we should always lean on God in
[58:28] everything that we
[58:30] do because his grace is always with
[58:34] us you'll not have any other excuse that
[58:37] I failed because of
[58:39] this he has set
[58:42] examples we can see Jacob he was a
[58:45] supplanter he changed him that means
[58:49] what he did for them he can do it the
[58:51] same Hallelujah if he saved him he can
[58:56] save
[58:58] you if he forgave job he can forgive
[59:04] you don't easily give
[59:09] up we have a
[59:12] restaurant yeah we can read also in
[59:15] Matthew chapter 5 verse
[59:17] 15 it say up to 16 it says neither do
[59:21] men light a candle and put it under Bell
[59:25] but on a Candlestick and gives light
[59:28] onto all that are in the house let your
[59:31] light so shine before men that they may
[59:34] see your good works and glorify your
[59:37] father which is in
[59:38] heaven
[59:41] Hallelujah they let your light so shine
[59:45] that they may see your good
[59:47] works that they may
[59:50] see the examples you're giving to them
[59:53] that they may see your life your life
[59:55] will will be an example to
[59:58] someone to glorify God hallelujah it's
[1:00:03] not necessary that you'll come and
[1:00:04] preach here but your life can be a
[1:00:07] testimony to someone your life can be an
[1:00:10] example to
[1:00:11] someone I was reading uh some act
[1:00:16] from a book of that was written by RCA
[1:00:20] sister Rebeca
[1:00:22] Branham he was she was talking about her
[1:00:25] mother
[1:00:27] her mother
[1:00:30] sistera she was telling her that Mom for
[1:00:34] you enjoy they were talking for you
[1:00:36] enjoy washing
[1:00:39] clothes then the mother looked at her in
[1:00:43] a you know when someone tells you
[1:00:45] something you look at them
[1:00:47] and there's a when when you're not happy
[1:00:50] with what he said or when you're not
[1:00:53] when you're not like
[1:00:56] how can I when you're not like in the
[1:00:59] same like in the same direction of what
[1:01:01] he's
[1:01:02] meaning you someone will easily know so
[1:01:06] the mother the mother replied to her she
[1:01:09] said you may think I like washing clo
[1:01:12] this but uh
[1:01:15] no Rebecca was so
[1:01:20] surprised he said I I thought you you
[1:01:22] like washing clothes even when you go to
[1:01:25] outside
[1:01:26] on missions you always washing clothes I
[1:01:30] thought you enjoy
[1:01:32] it but she said
[1:01:37] no the mother also gave some little like
[1:01:41] she she she was telling she she when she
[1:01:43] she went she she started pray she was
[1:01:46] going to
[1:01:47] pray then she felt so
[1:01:51] bad that other ministers wives like the
[1:01:55] ones that were working with uh brother
[1:01:58] Branham they were supporting in the
[1:02:01] ministry in the music uh in serving in
[1:02:05] doing other things in
[1:02:08] ministering but for her she she was not
[1:02:10] doing anything she reached out a point
[1:02:13] saying ah maybe even I'm not worthy
[1:02:16] brother
[1:02:17] Branham that's what she started
[1:02:20] feeling but she said she started praying
[1:02:24] she was so heartbroken
[1:02:28] when she started
[1:02:31] praying a voice spoke to
[1:02:35] her she it said you can
[1:02:41] pray what am I coming
[1:02:43] to to the mothers to to our
[1:02:48] sisters it is not necessary that you'll
[1:02:51] do something that everyone will see you
[1:02:54] because when when when she she heard
[1:02:57] that voice she said yes I can pray I can
[1:03:01] do a service for God however much little
[1:03:04] it
[1:03:06] is it inspired very many people very
[1:03:10] many people gave her respect because of
[1:03:13] her of her being so humble and of her
[1:03:16] wisdom she of her
[1:03:19] wisdom when she was washing the clothes
[1:03:21] once again she washed them and iron them
[1:03:25] while praying for
[1:03:29] them setting an
[1:03:31] example of
[1:03:34] mothers of
[1:03:36] sisters you may think you you're doing
[1:03:39] nothing you may say sister like sister
[1:03:41] charity right now she plays a guitar for
[1:03:44] you a sister you cannot you do not have
[1:03:45] even a good voice you cannot sing you
[1:03:48] say now what can I do for
[1:03:51] God you just
[1:03:54] there pray
[1:03:57] pray for the
[1:04:00] brothers pray for the
[1:04:02] ministers pray for pray for those on
[1:04:05] that are playing even instruments play
[1:04:07] for pray for
[1:04:09] them you may see it as a small thing but
[1:04:13] you're doing God a
[1:04:14] service
[1:04:16] Hallelujah we have to set examples in
[1:04:19] all
[1:04:21] ways if you cannot do any other thing
[1:04:25] come on more the
[1:04:26] church they will know you because of
[1:04:28] moping the
[1:04:30] church there's no there's nothing that
[1:04:33] we are doing in this world for the
[1:04:36] service of God that will go
[1:04:39] unpaid so if you feel that you're not
[1:04:42] that you cannot do any other anything in
[1:04:44] church or anything to help the bride of
[1:04:48] Christ then I don't
[1:04:50] know I don't know what you will be paid
[1:04:54] Hallelujah
[1:04:56] we should set
[1:04:58] examples
[1:05:00] Hallelujah set at least one they will
[1:05:04] know they say ah that brother can pray
[1:05:06] when I feel I I have something ah I'll
[1:05:08] go to that brother he will help me we
[1:05:10] shall pray
[1:05:13] together
[1:05:16] Hallelujah set an
[1:05:19] example we have a
[1:05:22] race
[1:05:24] Hallelujah every one that is here you
[1:05:28] have a rest to
[1:05:31] rant I don't know you there's no
[1:05:34] shortcut for that
[1:05:37] race we are taking the race because God
[1:05:41] trusted
[1:05:44] Us in this generation he ordained us
[1:05:48] this L de generation that is so
[1:05:52] dirty but he called us out for a reason
[1:05:57] may we never disappoint
[1:05:59] God may we always stand with the
[1:06:02] truth some of us we may be laughed at
[1:06:06] sometimes you go and preach to someone
[1:06:09] they laugh at you you tell someone the
[1:06:16] truth sometime back I was at school and
[1:06:19] I selling one of my friends he told me
[1:06:22] never trust God 100% I said ah
[1:06:31] never some people may think having this
[1:06:34] uh some people are replacing god with
[1:06:37] these little things these World
[1:06:39] things replacing God you may say I have
[1:06:42] a land I have a car you may think those
[1:06:46] are the the major blessings of God that
[1:06:48] he gives but those are just little
[1:06:51] things
[1:06:53] Hallelujah let us not be taken by little
[1:06:56] things sometimes situations
[1:06:58] come in life and they seem be sometimes
[1:07:02] they seem bigger in our
[1:07:08] [Music]
[1:07:24] lives no
[1:07:26] sometimes we people need want want God
[1:07:29] to to to take the same things that we
[1:07:31] are thinking in our heart our minds that
[1:07:34] if this is the door it's what God has to
[1:07:36] take us through but God is
[1:07:41] good as soon as the children of Israel
[1:07:44] reached River Jordan it's it had to be
[1:07:48] part and created way for
[1:07:52] them he can create way here you may see
[1:07:55] a wall here but he creates
[1:07:58] way how did he Phil preach the other man
[1:08:02] uh
[1:08:03] when that that unich that was on the on
[1:08:06] water
[1:08:09] floating did he
[1:08:11] fly that was God's way Hallelujah he's
[1:08:15] setting examples for
[1:08:17] us he set examples in the past but he
[1:08:22] again setting examples amid us
[1:08:24] hallelujah
[1:08:25] he's setting examples to everyone
[1:08:28] whatever situation you're going through
[1:08:30] he's setting an example to someone who
[1:08:31] has gone through it
[1:08:35] Hallelujah you may think you're left
[1:08:40] alone but what may help you go through
[1:08:44] such things
[1:08:47] fellowshipping Hallelujah when you
[1:08:49] fellowship with your brothers they will
[1:08:52] tell you ah I was also going through
[1:08:54] something like this but God helped me
[1:08:58] and I went through it but some people
[1:09:00] when I they're going through difficult
[1:09:02] situations they go and they separate
[1:09:05] themselves from people they go and do
[1:09:07] other things they say ah God left me so
[1:09:10] let me do my let me let me find a way
[1:09:13] that I can go through
[1:09:15] something but you're going to fail
[1:09:19] because his word says is the way truth
[1:09:22] and
[1:09:23] light if you're trying to make make your
[1:09:25] own
[1:09:26] way hey you may find yourself in a tel
[1:09:29] that you cannot go through
[1:09:33] Hallelujah because he said he's the way
[1:09:35] truth and
[1:09:37] light
[1:09:40] Hallelujah set
[1:09:43] examples even
[1:09:44] to the church members that you're with
[1:09:48] don't just be
[1:09:52] a yeah we see even brother Bram he was
[1:09:57] speaking
[1:09:58] about Zacharia the father of
[1:10:02] John here he says and let me read you
[1:10:06] this quote from
[1:10:20] uh it is I believest thou this
[1:10:26] this brother Bram
[1:10:29] said well now I want you to note
[1:10:33] something look here a minister of the
[1:10:36] Gospel a clar man well learned but he
[1:10:41] failed to believe the angel he said how
[1:10:44] can these things
[1:10:46] be I'm old and my wife's is my wife is
[1:10:51] old well how could these things be
[1:10:56] why he said I'm Gabriel that sent from
[1:11:00] God he
[1:11:02] said and because you are you you you
[1:11:07] have doubted my word you will be dumb
[1:11:10] till the day the baby's born for my word
[1:11:14] for my for my words are going to take
[1:11:17] effect when God speaks anything it's
[1:11:20] just got to be
[1:11:22] so and then when he said so
[1:11:25] why of course was his
[1:11:28] meeting now
[1:11:30] look seems like that the priest he could
[1:11:34] not look back in the Bible here he had
[1:11:38] plenty of examples of Sarah Hanah a few
[1:11:43] of these back there were who after the
[1:11:47] the pass of the age of bearing received
[1:11:50] children but just so ruined his work
[1:11:55] that he could not V he could not vary a
[1:11:57] bit from from just what he was taught
[1:12:01] and that's about the condition the
[1:12:03] church is today isn't it right isn't
[1:12:07] that right just your regular routine you
[1:12:10] know and usually God comes around and
[1:12:15] interprets all the all all the time you
[1:12:19] know yes sir with his
[1:12:22] program we have plenty of examples that
[1:12:26] are being set like we see this priest
[1:12:29] Zacharia he didn't he didn't believe
[1:12:34] it he didn't even sometimes we read the
[1:12:37] Bible we read different examples in the
[1:12:41] Bible but we leave them
[1:12:45] aside we leave them aside because people
[1:12:48] are saying that cannot be
[1:12:50] possible see
[1:12:52] Zara even in church people are leaving
[1:12:55] right examples and are saying ah that
[1:12:58] cannot
[1:12:59] be if God Did It for someone he can do
[1:13:03] it the same even right now if you fill
[1:13:06] someone with the Holy Spirit he can feel
[1:13:09] you the
[1:13:10] same Hallelujah if you give someone what
[1:13:13] you're yearning for if you give someone
[1:13:16] a husband he can give you also if you
[1:13:20] give someone a wife he can give you if
[1:13:24] you give give some someone a car that is
[1:13:27] something little to God
[1:13:30] hallelujah let us don't be let us don't
[1:13:33] look at examples men give that for me
[1:13:35] I've worked for years and years I've not
[1:13:37] even got I've served God that I've not
[1:13:39] got anything those people are not always
[1:13:41] right with God that's right that's right
[1:13:44] are never right go when you serve God
[1:13:47] righteously ah I don't he can never fail
[1:13:52] you never will God fail you when he
[1:13:55] serve right
[1:13:58] righteously those people always giving
[1:14:00] wrong examples are the people that live
[1:14:03] a double
[1:14:07] life you you you see them at church well
[1:14:10] dress you see them at church praying
[1:14:13] singing you say that sister is
[1:14:16] spiritual but yet when they go outside
[1:14:18] that brother is spiritual when they go
[1:14:20] outside H you look at someone and
[1:14:23] someone will scare you
[1:14:29] take right
[1:14:32] examples the God we serve can never fail
[1:14:36] some people are making
[1:14:38] God they're making God as if he cannot
[1:14:41] do anything for us the creator of Heaven
[1:14:44] and
[1:14:45] Earth the creat the creator of all the
[1:14:48] things that you look at of all the good
[1:14:50] things you may say he did not create CS
[1:14:53] but he's the one who created the men who
[1:14:55] are making C that's right
[1:14:59] Hallelujah that
[1:15:01] God when you serve him
[1:15:04] righteously he will give you something
[1:15:07] that you're yearning for you'll also set
[1:15:09] an example for
[1:15:11] someone
[1:15:12] Hallelujah am Mary had no example but
[1:15:18] she stood on the word of
[1:15:21] God Zakaria failed to stand on the word
[1:15:24] of God sometimes you may you may look at
[1:15:26] someone in church you say ah because
[1:15:28] he's in church so if he didn't get it I
[1:15:31] can also not Get It Mary had no
[1:15:35] example what happened to Mary Had never
[1:15:38] happened to
[1:15:39] anyone but why did she some people are
[1:15:42] meant to be examples even of the new
[1:15:45] things that are coming up
[1:15:47] [Music]
[1:15:49] Hallelujah because the word promises
[1:15:52] that there will be a short work for
[1:15:55] right do you believe
[1:15:57] it if you believe it then things are
[1:15:59] going people are going to to discern
[1:16:02] your life people are going to speak
[1:16:04] different things people are going to to
[1:16:07] to bring people back to life yes they're
[1:16:11] going to pray and bring and bring people
[1:16:13] back to life then you'll not believe
[1:16:18] it look at Mary she set a right example
[1:16:22] she believed whatever God spoke to to
[1:16:25] her sometimes we look at our lives you
[1:16:28] say I cannot make it you look at your
[1:16:32] fathers they didn't make it you have
[1:16:39] nothing
[1:16:41] Hallelujah Abraham left his
[1:16:45] home God sent him he say separate from
[1:16:48] your family he went without even
[1:16:51] anything almost
[1:16:55] but we when we read in the Bible you was
[1:16:57] among the richest
[1:16:58] men where do all those things come from
[1:17:02] just believe unto
[1:17:04] God sometimes we are taken up by small
[1:17:09] things we we then to to put them on the
[1:17:12] same on the same level with God if you
[1:17:15] fail to get something then you're saying
[1:17:18] ah
[1:17:20] no why do you how can you say something
[1:17:24] that is created even by man you set it
[1:17:27] as on the same level with
[1:17:31] God some people are calling blessings of
[1:17:35] God these minor things in life that you
[1:17:38] can die and
[1:17:41] live people are not some people are not
[1:17:44] even telling people to be filled with
[1:17:47] the holy spirit that is the best you can
[1:17:50] get in the
[1:17:51] world because you have Hidden Treasures
[1:17:54] Hallelujah
[1:17:55] you have the Hidden
[1:17:58] Treasures if you are filled with the
[1:18:00] Holy
[1:18:01] Spirit we are going to receive things
[1:18:05] that our eyes have not seen our ears
[1:18:07] have not heard Hallelujah that no man
[1:18:11] has heard
[1:18:13] of but don't follow wrong
[1:18:19] examples
[1:18:21] Hallelujah we see even here in Psalms
[1:18:25] God is also setting an example for Old
[1:18:28] Men not only the youth is setting
[1:18:31] examples for Old Men Let us read that
[1:18:35] that
[1:18:36] verse it is in Psalms chapter
[1:18:41] 71:18 it says now also when I am old and
[1:18:46] grey-headed oh God forsake me not till I
[1:18:50] have showed thy strength unto this
[1:18:53] generation
[1:18:54] and thy power to everyone that is in is
[1:18:58] to come even old men are setting
[1:19:02] examples even the young men are setting
[1:19:04] examples some people may think when we
[1:19:07] grow you leave the rest to the young
[1:19:10] people but you still have to set an
[1:19:13] example there's a I was in ginger
[1:19:17] there's a who used to sit in front that
[1:19:20] used to
[1:19:22] sing I I I used to look at him most of
[1:19:25] the
[1:19:27] times he used to sing and jump you see
[1:19:30] he's old grhe
[1:19:33] headed but he used to
[1:19:37] sing what is that an
[1:19:39] example that you the youth are going to
[1:19:43] God will will say I give you all the
[1:19:44] strength I gave you everything but you
[1:19:47] didn't use it look at this man he used
[1:19:49] the strength even the little he
[1:19:53] had Hallelujah
[1:19:56] may we set
[1:19:58] examples may we set examples in every in
[1:20:02] everything because the word of God is
[1:20:04] like a menu of Our Lives a menu of the
[1:20:09] Bride instructions of the Bride
[1:20:13] Hallelujah just follow all those
[1:20:16] instructions you'll set a better example
[1:20:19] to
[1:20:20] everyone Hallelujah
[1:20:25] some people are taken up
[1:20:27] by by by Fame because you see someone is
[1:20:30] Fame you say that is the right I want to
[1:20:33] be like that
[1:20:36] one that person you can wake up in the
[1:20:38] morning and you he you'll said you
[1:20:41] listen to news they tell you that
[1:20:42] someone died of a car accident the one
[1:20:46] that you want to to be
[1:20:50] like remember the other rich man
[1:20:55] when uh rarus was asking for some even
[1:20:59] something little to
[1:21:03] eat but when when when all died things
[1:21:09] changed so choose right
[1:21:13] examples as you also be right examples
[1:21:16] to others we are setting examples to the
[1:21:19] people that are looking at us we are
[1:21:21] setting examples of the right bride that
[1:21:23] is coming
[1:21:25] that is already
[1:21:28] here some part of the Bride is still in
[1:21:31] the world if if the bride was already
[1:21:34] gathered up would not be
[1:21:37] here so you are setting an example for
[1:21:40] the one for the last parts that are in
[1:21:43] the world
[1:21:45] Hallelujah if you believe you're the
[1:21:49] bride that's that's what you ought to do
[1:21:52] there's nothing else setting an example
[1:21:55] for the bride when you preach to
[1:21:59] someone let even sometimes you do not
[1:22:02] need even to
[1:22:04] preach your life explains
[1:22:10] everything there some people even you
[1:22:12] look at he said even in the way there's
[1:22:14] one person who told us when we were at
[1:22:16] church he said there's a lady who looked
[1:22:19] at me she said you're going to church
[1:22:23] because of of how she looked
[1:22:27] like he said you are you going to church
[1:22:30] he said yes I'm going to church can we
[1:22:32] go together that lady had to pray that
[1:22:35] day what are we setting examples to the
[1:22:40] world let your light so shine that
[1:22:44] men that those that will look at you
[1:22:47] will glorify God they say those people
[1:22:50] really have
[1:22:52] God don't make our God a
[1:22:55] failure people are making God as if he
[1:22:58] has no power because you're living
[1:23:03] wrongly
[1:23:06] Hallelujah you're the same person we see
[1:23:09] in church you're the same person we see
[1:23:10] out there doing some bad
[1:23:15] stuff so how will you set
[1:23:20] examples think of that set right
[1:23:23] examples
[1:23:26] Hallelujah am said right
[1:23:30] examples and the Lord will reward you of
[1:23:33] everything you
[1:23:35] do you may think is very
[1:23:40] little you may think ah cleaning church
[1:23:43] is something
[1:23:45] little but doing
[1:23:49] it you're setting examples that God will
[1:23:53] use will some people but but I didn't
[1:23:56] have even something to do in church
[1:23:58] everything was being done by different
[1:24:00] people at least if someone is moping at
[1:24:04] least bring water for for that
[1:24:07] person
[1:24:08] hallelujah
[1:24:11] amen may we set examples in this
[1:24:14] age because God has ordained every
[1:24:18] person you look at here to be examples
[1:24:22] to set examples in this
[1:24:24] generation we are not in the generation
[1:24:27] of Paul right now we are not in the
[1:24:29] generation of John
[1:24:33] wisley we are setting examples to our
[1:24:37] generation what they went through it's
[1:24:39] not what we are going through right now
[1:24:43] Hallelujah so we are setting
[1:24:47] examples that will be
[1:24:50] brought we are the people who are going
[1:24:52] to go God will be using
[1:24:55] you say some people will say but I lived
[1:24:58] righteously what and what they say no
[1:25:02] this was the right thing you may have
[1:25:04] told someone the truth sometimes most of
[1:25:07] the times is not that everyone You
[1:25:10] Preach to has to believe but sometimes
[1:25:13] you preach to someone to be a witness on
[1:25:17] that
[1:25:18] day so that is one of the examples
[1:25:21] you're setting for
[1:25:23] everyone there bring an example they say
[1:25:25] uh
[1:25:26] come you see they told you you failed to
[1:25:30] do
[1:25:32] it examples even as we go in classes
[1:25:35] examples are say are given to
[1:25:39] us when before giving an
[1:25:45] assignment we are always given
[1:25:48] examples
[1:25:52] Hallelujah but as we are given examples
[1:25:55] we also setting at the same time
[1:26:00] examples God is not always is going to
[1:26:03] rely on History he going to bring even
[1:26:06] present things yes we cannot let back
[1:26:10] the the the
[1:26:12] the the examples we received back then
[1:26:16] in the Old Testament in the New
[1:26:20] Testament we just adding up we just
[1:26:23] writing a new book of Acts
[1:26:26] hallelujah what they did it's what we
[1:26:29] are doing again amen but if you do not
[1:26:32] follow the right steps you'll miss it
[1:26:38] out set right
[1:26:42] examples
[1:26:43] Hallelujah be a witness someone that you
[1:26:48] know there are some things we go through
[1:26:52] in life
[1:26:55] that someone will look at and say if
[1:26:57] someone went through something like that
[1:27:00] it means I can also go through
[1:27:03] it
[1:27:05] Hallelujah if God can change someone God
[1:27:09] can change
[1:27:11] me that's what you you're supposed to be
[1:27:14] having in
[1:27:15] mind but some people think they fail
[1:27:19] totally because of what because even of
[1:27:22] the cires that you always having
[1:27:24] the circles that are being you examples
[1:27:27] you look at your friend you say ah that
[1:27:29] one failed you look at this that one
[1:27:31] failed because of the wrong examples
[1:27:33] you're taking in your circle right make
[1:27:36] right circles but if you with your your
[1:27:38] brother you see ah he's serious with the
[1:27:41] word though I'm you may not be serious
[1:27:43] with the word he say ah the other one is
[1:27:47] serious you look at say is
[1:27:50] serious that will motivate you sometimes
[1:27:53] we are in wrong Circle
[1:27:56] the ones that will call
[1:27:58] examples because they have something
[1:28:00] that you're yearning for you say if God
[1:28:03] gave them that thing
[1:28:05] maybe maybe they
[1:28:09] right make right circles the right
[1:28:12] circles are going to give you right
[1:28:15] examples in life and when you take the
[1:28:18] right examples in life definitely your
[1:28:21] life has to be good your life has to be
[1:28:24] in the line of God's word
[1:28:30] hallelujah sometimes we we look at
[1:28:32] things and say ah if the didn't make it
[1:28:37] then I can also not make
[1:28:39] it but examples are being set like we
[1:28:43] see this
[1:28:44] priest people are failing to look at
[1:28:48] examples because
[1:28:50] of of of not looking Beyond
[1:28:55] people have a wrong mindset a negative
[1:29:01] mindset but you not
[1:29:04] go before the way of God you not go be
[1:29:07] like you not disrupt God's plans even if
[1:29:11] you not taking his word or not seeing it
[1:29:15] as an example to you he fail to
[1:29:19] see but he would not distract God's go
[1:29:23] God's plans
[1:29:26] sometimes we go through difficult
[1:29:27] situations in life because of the the
[1:29:31] what we take he would not have been
[1:29:35] blind he would not not have been dumb if
[1:29:39] he took it if he just believed the word
[1:29:42] if he just looked that if God Did It for
[1:29:44] the other people he can do it the same
[1:29:47] he would have not been dump
[1:29:51] hallelujah what examples are you taking
[1:29:54] taking in
[1:29:57] life think of
[1:30:00] that sometimes we take wrong people as
[1:30:03] examples as people that motivate
[1:30:07] us sometimes we take wrong
[1:30:10] things music the so-call some music that
[1:30:14] is called gospel
[1:30:17] music you say ah now this one is Gospel
[1:30:20] this is the example I'm taking
[1:30:25] some people are
[1:30:26] taking the the
[1:30:28] borderline
[1:30:30] examples brother Bram said if you put on
[1:30:34] a skirt below the knees then it's okay
[1:30:37] I'm also taking
[1:30:40] that he said this and this ah I'm taking
[1:30:44] that but you're failing to take the
[1:30:46] right example that's
[1:30:49] right you know even when Jesus was
[1:30:51] speaking to to the crowds in the New
[1:30:56] Testament he spoke Parables but after he
[1:31:01] explained them to
[1:31:04] his if you really understand the message
[1:31:07] you really brother
[1:31:09] Bram he was right in the middle of the
[1:31:12] word he used to speak some things that
[1:31:16] when you take it canally you'll miss out
[1:31:20] the point what he
[1:31:22] meant there are very many
[1:31:25] things people always want to take the
[1:31:27] milk they do not want they they do not
[1:31:31] want to take the hard
[1:31:33] food they like as simple
[1:31:37] things things that give them uh peace
[1:31:42] what what they call even peace that even
[1:31:44] is not even peace if you have no Christ
[1:31:47] in you that is even not peace right you
[1:31:50] look at people that you saying ah those
[1:31:51] people have a peaceful family but you
[1:31:54] don't know what is taking place in their
[1:31:56] families some people look at Bobby wi
[1:32:00] and BBY ah
[1:32:04] those let me tell you any person that
[1:32:07] does not have God in
[1:32:09] life any person they should never lie
[1:32:13] you that they they good or in life is
[1:32:18] going on
[1:32:20] well people come and smile to others in
[1:32:23] the crowd
[1:32:24] but when they go to their rooms we find
[1:32:27] someone so
[1:32:28] sorrowful you look at rich
[1:32:32] people you may say ah that made it in
[1:32:35] life my
[1:32:39] idea don't be lied right someone who
[1:32:44] made it in life is someone who is filled
[1:32:47] with the holy
[1:32:49] spirit that person will even if you find
[1:32:52] someone sleeping
[1:32:54] is
[1:32:55] smiling because he's peaceful someone
[1:32:59] filled with the holy
[1:33:01] spirit that is the right example you
[1:33:03] take in
[1:33:05] life he may not have the worldly things
[1:33:08] that you're looking at he may not have
[1:33:09] the car you want he may not have the
[1:33:12] right the good clothes you want he may
[1:33:14] not have something you want but those
[1:33:17] people are always
[1:33:18] peaceful have a peace of mind there's
[1:33:21] nothing we need in life like a peace of
[1:33:23] of
[1:33:25] Mind
[1:33:28] Hallelujah a peace of mind is better
[1:33:30] than any other
[1:33:32] thing you look at people having
[1:33:36] everything that you're yearning for in
[1:33:38] life but do not have a peace of
[1:33:41] mind you you see them on
[1:33:45] televisions you may think they're
[1:33:50] okay but they're not okay
[1:33:55] Hallelujah so take right
[1:34:00] examples though sometimes God's examples
[1:34:05] are
[1:34:06] always criticized and
[1:34:09] undermined but the examples he took look
[1:34:13] at brother
[1:34:16] Branham why did God choose a man who was
[1:34:19] not
[1:34:20] educated to preach the message to the
[1:34:23] the
[1:34:25] educated to the the people that are not
[1:34:27] educated to the Presidents to the big
[1:34:31] people in the
[1:34:32] world why did God choose such a
[1:34:35] person do you think there were no people
[1:34:39] that were educated that would spread the
[1:34:40] message very well better than brother
[1:34:47] Bram you're taking right you're taking
[1:34:50] wrong examples
[1:34:52] sometimes because of what but the the
[1:34:55] perspective people have given you about
[1:35:01] life is always taking the the ones that
[1:35:04] you
[1:35:05] despise they're the right
[1:35:10] examples right now the bride is despised
[1:35:14] even when you speak people they will
[1:35:16] laugh at you
[1:35:31] this life is just in Job 14 verse1 it
[1:35:37] says we have
[1:35:40] like a man a man born of a woman is full
[1:35:43] of trouble and of of short days in like
[1:35:46] like here in
[1:35:49] life so let me tell you every those
[1:35:53] people that you take as examples examine
[1:35:57] them but you cannot examine them when
[1:36:00] you do not have the Holy
[1:36:03] Spirit look if you feel like taking any
[1:36:07] any example in church look at someone
[1:36:10] filled with the Holy
[1:36:14] Spirit look at those people they may not
[1:36:17] have what you really
[1:36:19] want but sooner or later they can get
[1:36:22] every everything
[1:36:27] that people have worked for for 15 years
[1:36:29] 20 years someone can get them in just
[1:36:32] one
[1:36:34] year how God is
[1:36:37] able some people are saying some sisters
[1:36:41] may may are taking wrong examples
[1:36:44] because when they look at ah I'm I'm
[1:36:46] approaching 28 I'm approaching
[1:36:49] 30 and all those that are reach at that
[1:36:51] age always say ah I'm late for marriage
[1:36:54] you just go for
[1:36:57] anyone but have you ever thought of
[1:37:00] other examples not all that sisters that
[1:37:04] get married lately are
[1:37:07] always having a long or are walking in a
[1:37:11] not like a life that is not
[1:37:16] good sometimes the set
[1:37:20] examples that you'll
[1:37:22] see some
[1:37:24] people are there to be
[1:37:28] examples why do you
[1:37:30] think people like why do you think lame
[1:37:34] people are born why do you think blind
[1:37:36] people are born you may say did this
[1:37:39] person commit anything to
[1:37:41] God but those people are set like are
[1:37:44] set to be examples you'll find a lame
[1:37:49] man preaching there's a man that I
[1:37:51] always see on the way he he preaches
[1:37:54] with one leg he's always standing on one
[1:37:56] leg some of us I don't know what we
[1:37:58] shall tell
[1:38:00] God you have everything but you're just
[1:38:04] there
[1:38:07] lazy those are the examples you may say
[1:38:09] he's not a message believer but he's
[1:38:12] better than you at least he's trying to
[1:38:15] spread the word of
[1:38:17] God may God have mercy on
[1:38:22] us may we set the right
[1:38:26] examples because God is
[1:38:29] only is only looking at us right now
[1:38:34] there's no any other Angel going to come
[1:38:36] to S There's No Angel going to come set
[1:38:39] an example there's no one but the bride
[1:38:43] of
[1:38:47] Christ Hallelujah
[1:38:53] may we set right
[1:38:56] examples let us uh read this
[1:39:08] quote
[1:39:16] Hallelujah here brother Bram again was
[1:39:18] speaking about Mary he said and then she
[1:39:22] went to tell
[1:39:24] someone that you know usually when you
[1:39:27] get something from God you want to tell
[1:39:30] every everybody else about
[1:39:33] it here she's she here she going around
[1:39:38] testifying that she's going to have a
[1:39:40] baby not knowing any man before there is
[1:39:44] any life or
[1:39:47] anything if Mary could do that by
[1:39:50] something that had never happened before
[1:39:54] how much more ought you to do it when
[1:39:58] you sick and take him at his word
[1:40:03] thousands are healed every year you
[1:40:06] ought to take him at his at his
[1:40:10] word why Mary had nothing for an example
[1:40:15] the only thing she had was the word
[1:40:20] you've got the word plus millions of of
[1:40:23] examples every day
[1:40:30] Hallelujah some of the things you the
[1:40:32] people going to stand at the
[1:40:40] Forefront some of the things you're
[1:40:42] going to stand if God do if you've never
[1:40:44] seen a person healed of cancer you can
[1:40:47] say I'm going to be healed and you're he
[1:40:50] you set an example to the people around
[1:40:52] you
[1:40:55] always hear those testimonies for those
[1:40:58] that read the
[1:41:00] message you hear someone healed of
[1:41:02] cancer someone heal raised from
[1:41:06] dead but brother Bram saying those
[1:41:08] things that we we as the bride are going
[1:41:11] to do the same
[1:41:13] things
[1:41:15] Hallelujah we have a short but quick
[1:41:19] work but if that short quick work does
[1:41:21] not find you prepared
[1:41:24] you even not know it that it is taking
[1:41:30] place because of what you're taking
[1:41:32] right wrong
[1:41:37] examples you you hearing this and this
[1:41:39] this and this ah what did K say what did
[1:41:43] this man ofo say what did this and this
[1:41:47] but you're living out what even you're
[1:41:49] supposed to listen
[1:41:51] to you're taking wrong
[1:41:55] examples because of the crowds they
[1:42:00] have
[1:42:03] Hallelujah Mary had no
[1:42:05] example but she stood as an
[1:42:12] example
[1:42:14] Hallelujah may we change that
[1:42:19] mindset of saying ah this and this
[1:42:22] because this one failed or this
[1:42:26] this who
[1:42:31] failed
[1:42:32] Hallelujah may we set right
[1:42:35] examples may we be Duty
[1:42:39] bound if you you you at the post of your
[1:42:43] duty however small it
[1:42:47] is you'll be an
[1:42:51] example however small it
[1:42:56] is you'll be an example on that small
[1:43:02] thing they will know you for doing
[1:43:05] something you'll have set an example for
[1:43:08] someone some people just need a small
[1:43:11] thing to turn their lives
[1:43:15] around but even the little things would
[1:43:17] not do
[1:43:19] them Hallelujah
[1:43:26] we are setting examples in this dirty
[1:43:34] generation there's somewhere I usually
[1:43:37] eat food
[1:43:38] from were talking that I told
[1:43:44] them that for me I'm going to
[1:43:47] marry I'll not have like this I not

[1:43:54] wrong person I have I told them I have
[1:43:58] examples of people who have good right
[1:44:02] people for you you're taking wrong
[1:44:04] examples because the other one failed
[1:44:08] the other un
[1:44:09] failed I said for me I believe God can I
[1:44:13] said if you're right with God he cannot
[1:44:16] even allow you make a mistake how can I
[1:44:18] make a mistake
[1:44:23] you have right example set before
[1:44:27] you they telling you on no condition
[1:44:30] you're not supposed to Mar
[1:44:32] unbel but for
[1:44:34] you she can change or he can
[1:44:38] change on what
[1:44:42] conditions I told them you wait you'll
[1:44:45] see I'll even call you on my
[1:44:49] wedding
[1:44:51] Hallelujah we have to say right
[1:44:54] examples if they think all man all all
[1:44:57] all young men are going to be in that D
[1:45:02] are going to live such a life tell them
[1:45:05] no I'm not setting that
[1:45:07] example let me set your an example that
[1:45:10] is
[1:45:11] right
[1:45:13] Hallelujah people no longer Believe In
[1:45:18] Truth they
[1:45:21] think some things like truth ended long
[1:45:24] time ago it is no longer even in the
[1:45:26] world loyality is no longer in the
[1:45:29] world because of what examples the ones
[1:45:33] that are supposed to be examples again
[1:45:35] looking at other
[1:45:38] people we have to set right examples if
[1:45:41] people say it cannot be we have a neor
[1:45:44] God hallelujah we able to set right
[1:45:50] examples we are setting right examples
[1:45:53] in this dirty
[1:45:59] generation for me my friends that I
[1:46:02] started
[1:46:04] with always
[1:46:14] me wait you'll
[1:46:20] see we had set right examples
[1:46:25] Hallelujah set right examples your
[1:46:28] neighbors they say ah that person he
[1:46:31] prays a
[1:46:34] lot people are going to even start
[1:46:36] respecting you because of the example
[1:46:39] you're setting to them even old people
[1:46:40] will seek councel from you and say ah
[1:46:44] that person is
[1:46:47] different they will seek knowledge from
[1:46:51] you
[1:46:55] because you're setting a right
[1:47:00] example
[1:47:03] Hallelujah may God help us set right
[1:47:07] examples however much situations are
[1:47:10] difficult to us may we set right
[1:47:17] examples may we lean on God's word
[1:47:23] because it is the only thing that can
[1:47:26] help
[1:47:27] us really set a good example to the
[1:47:32] rest
[1:47:34] Hallelujah because he is our creator he
[1:47:37] knows
[1:47:39] everything so if we follow his word I
[1:47:42] don't think we can set wrong
[1:47:47] examples if you follow every everything
[1:47:51] has been
[1:47:54] every everything you see in the world
[1:47:56] there's an example for
[1:47:58] it be it marriage he said an example he
[1:48:02] said a man is supposed to be of one
[1:48:08] woman be it love be it be it patience be
[1:48:11] it anything that we look at right now we
[1:48:15] have seen right
[1:48:16] examples people have been patient
[1:48:23] but for us sometimes we need uh things
[1:48:26] to be so quick in
[1:48:32] life at times we take even things that
[1:48:35] we are not supposed to take that you
[1:48:37] want to get rich quickly I do this do
[1:48:40] this and this you'll get rich
[1:48:46] quickly at the end you
[1:48:48] start abusing people saying ah God is
[1:48:52] Not faithful yet you're the one not
[1:48:56] faithful he said for your
[1:48:59] examples but you're not taking
[1:49:03] them
[1:49:05] Hallelujah may God help
[1:49:11] us he
[1:49:13] said new as an example to
[1:49:16] us he said like it was in the days of
[1:49:20] Noah it will be the same as this
[1:49:23] people are leaving out that
[1:49:26] example people are taking their own
[1:49:31] perspectives look at people that were
[1:49:34] saved in newah
[1:49:36] time very few but people are taking big
[1:49:44] crowds may you look at right
[1:49:50] examples the message that we have right
[1:49:53] now people bled people had to die people
[1:49:58] had to sacrifice very many
[1:50:01] things so that can go forth that can
[1:50:04] reach you but for you just Seated on
[1:50:09] it you may find here some people who
[1:50:12] have never even had the message even
[1:50:15] putting a like playing a message like
[1:50:18] for 2
[1:50:19] hours some people who have never even
[1:50:22] completed a book one
[1:50:25] book on 1,000 something the messages
[1:50:29] brother Bram preached so what examples
[1:50:32] do you expect to
[1:50:34] get it is like when you're
[1:50:37] studying if you don't look at examples
[1:50:40] the teacher gives you what do you what
[1:50:43] do you expect to do in the
[1:50:46] papers you'll do nothing
[1:50:53] may we take right examples that God has
[1:50:55] said for us
[1:51:02] hallelujah may we read these
[1:51:06] scriptures as we're winding
[1:51:21] up Hebrews chapter 12:
[1:51:26] 1-2 was wherefor
[1:51:29] seeing we also have compassed about with
[1:51:32] all we sorry let me repeat
[1:51:39] again wherefore
[1:51:41] seeing we are also we are also our
[1:51:45] Compass about which so great a cloud of
[1:51:49] witnesses let us lay aside every way
[1:51:53] it and the sin which do so easily beset
[1:51:59] us and let us run with patience the rest
[1:52:04] that is that is set before
[1:52:08] us looking onto Jesus the author and
[1:52:10] finish of our
[1:52:13] faith who for the joy that was set
[1:52:16] before him endureed the
[1:52:18] cross despising the shame and sit down
[1:52:23] at the right hand of the Throne of
[1:52:27] God may God help us
