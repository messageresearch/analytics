[1:45:10] for and believing that they will also
[1:45:12] get married
[1:45:15] soon amen actually not a few more we
[1:45:17] have very
[1:45:19] many looking around I can see their
[1:45:21] faces
[1:45:23] and some of them even not here Sister
[1:45:24] Mary told me she went to Fellowship in
[1:45:26] another
[1:45:29] place uh for wanted to accomplish
[1:45:32] something
[1:45:33] there and um so uh and I know many are
[1:45:38] also tired from the
[1:45:41] wedding not able to come to the
[1:45:44] service I do not support
[1:45:47] that just for the
[1:45:49] record just for the record just for the
[1:45:51] record I'm saying that just for the
[1:45:54] [Music]
[1:45:56] we usually have things weddings this
[1:46:00] that but I believe when there is a
[1:46:03] church on Sunday
[1:46:05] morning and your church is
[1:46:08] gathering your place is at your post of
[1:46:14] Duty and especially on Sunday
[1:46:16] morning Wednesday
[1:46:19] evening these are our main church
[1:46:21] services
[1:46:23] you are not expected to be anywhere
[1:46:28] else if you want to visit another
[1:46:31] church that is all right 100% all right
[1:46:36] as long as it is not during when your
[1:46:39] church is having a church
[1:46:44] service that's what our Prophet told
[1:46:47] us and that's what we
[1:46:50] believe can I hear 100%
[1:46:54] amen your duty is at your post of
[1:46:59] Duty and your post of Duty is your home
[1:47:04] Church you don't only pay
[1:47:08] tith you have to
[1:47:10] come and be there maybe for only a few
[1:47:13] cases who are very far maybe out of the
[1:47:17] country
[1:47:19] nearby then they have to come and
[1:47:22] fellowship um by way of the
[1:47:26] internet but even those who go far
[1:47:29] there's a church close by I usually
[1:47:33] recommend them to first go to the church
[1:47:36] where they they to have to participate
[1:47:39] in in a physical church
[1:47:44] service and then they can stream our
[1:47:47] service
[1:47:49] afterwards there's no there's nothing
[1:47:51] that can replace physical Church
[1:47:58] attendance streaming is just an
[1:48:05] option it's an
[1:48:08] option yeah but you should never say I
[1:48:11] stay at home I'll
[1:48:15] stream it is not
[1:48:17] right you should always come to church
[1:48:23] always come to
[1:48:26] church being online cannot replace
[1:48:29] church
[1:48:33] service but if you are in a situation
[1:48:35] that you fixed and maybe you far or
[1:48:39] something very
[1:48:41] sick or you very
[1:48:43] sick then you can stream as an
[1:48:49] option why we put on the live stream
[1:48:57] so that after
[1:48:59] service we can go back and listen
[1:49:04] again that's the
[1:49:06] purpose and for those who are
[1:49:10] far in other countries
[1:49:12] especially that are a part of this
[1:49:16] ministry for them and they support the
[1:49:18] ministry
[1:49:19] here I don't believe in taking tithe
[1:49:22] from people and you're not feeding them
[1:49:28] with we make this available for
[1:49:32] them I remember the way we started
[1:49:35] actually streaming our
[1:49:40] services when the church in aasa did not
[1:49:43] have a pastor at the
[1:49:46] time and we had
[1:49:48] about 5 10 then they became about 20
[1:49:54] needed to to listen to stream the
[1:49:57] services that's how we started
[1:49:59] streaming so it is for those
[1:50:04] purposes but for the church
[1:50:08] here we should not abuse
[1:50:11] that we should always come to live
[1:50:14] church
[1:50:18] service I see 50% is here this morning
[1:50:23] and that's not good you should always
[1:50:26] come to church
[1:50:29] service will understand this time around
[1:50:31] all of us are
[1:50:33] from no I can never
[1:50:36] understand why you don't come to
[1:50:40] church when I have
[1:50:42] come I can never
[1:50:45] understand um personally I've been very
[1:50:50] busy for uh a long
[1:50:54] time and my body is beaten
[1:50:58] down we had the wedding we slept past
[1:51:03] midnight but then I had to prepare
[1:51:07] myself to come and
[1:51:09] minister so imagine going through all
[1:51:11] that
[1:51:13] suffering that
[1:51:14] sacrifice and then I come
[1:51:17] inside and
[1:51:19] you you are not here
[1:51:23] so I'm doing it for
[1:51:24] who I'm doing it for the you my
[1:51:28] children so if you're not
[1:51:31] here it is a heartbreaking for
[1:51:34] me your pastor who is expecting you to
[1:51:38] come God has given me food for
[1:51:42] you sometimes when I'm
[1:51:45] studying God can tell me
[1:51:47] even this one is for fortunate
[1:51:50] this this one
[1:51:52] when I come sometimes I even do like
[1:51:56] this
[1:51:58] forunate I become so
[1:52:01] discouraged give me something
[1:52:04] for I'm not saying forunate I'm giving
[1:52:06] an
[1:52:08] example sometimes God gives me something
[1:52:11] specifically for a
[1:52:14] person and I can assure you that can't
[1:52:16] happen in the church you are
[1:52:19] visiting can only happen at home
[1:52:24] so you see that's why you must always
[1:52:26] come to
[1:52:29] church amen amen you must always come to
[1:52:33] church it is your
[1:52:35] duty it is a
[1:52:37] responsibility we can never
[1:52:39] overemphasize
[1:52:42] that we can never overemphasize
[1:52:47] that whenever I talk about it I feel
[1:52:49] I've not exhausted it the way I would
[1:52:51] have talked about it
[1:52:56] but the Bel
[1:52:59] understand those of you who regularly
[1:53:02] attend
[1:53:03] church there people I know that this one
[1:53:06] will be
[1:53:09] there that one will be there even when I
[1:53:12] don't see them I know there is a big
[1:53:15] issue even call them
[1:53:18] how but someone who misses 2 3 4
[1:53:24] one is always like
[1:53:26] that so don't let your pastor say that
[1:53:28] one is always like
[1:53:30] that be among those that your pastor can
[1:53:34] even call when you
[1:53:37] miss or send a message that means he
[1:53:40] notices your absence and your
[1:53:45] presence um we have um um you know uh
[1:53:50] people
[1:53:52] that can even be coming to church for
[1:53:54] more than a
[1:53:56] year but your pastor doesn't know
[1:54:00] you that is a sign you are not
[1:54:07] regular you know pastors are
[1:54:11] responsible spiritually speaking before
[1:54:14] God they have to give
[1:54:17] accountability for the souls God gave
[1:54:20] them to sh
[1:54:23] and so you should always let them do
[1:54:25] their work with
[1:54:29] joy your mother cooks
[1:54:31] food and um then all all you
[1:54:36] boys and girls make yourself so busy
[1:54:39] with other
[1:54:41] things she will feel so
[1:54:44] bad I have a wife at
[1:54:47] home who is also my mother now
[1:54:52] and I'm her husband and I'm her father
[1:54:56] now so so when she cooks
[1:54:59] food and she brings it to me and it
[1:55:03] happens not to be my
[1:55:05] favorite and I don't eat it she always
[1:55:08] feels that
[1:55:11] broken and she always shows it to
[1:55:14] me and I feel bad about
[1:55:17] it and I believe that's how a pastor
[1:55:20] feels the same way a mother
[1:55:23] felds amen so you should always make
[1:55:26] your pastor
[1:55:28] happy if your pastor is
[1:55:31] happy your deons are
[1:55:33] happy I can assure you God is happy
[1:55:39] with amen amen I don't always say such
[1:55:43] words but I I realize as a pastor you I
[1:55:46] cannot run away from them
[1:55:51] [Music]

[2:02:24] going off and
[2:02:26] on Genesis
[2:02:48] 2521 we are going to read up to verses
[2:02:50] 24 to
[2:03:04] we are beginning from verses 25 although
[2:03:06] this sound was is not as good as that

[2:03:22] say amen yeah I think that's good
[2:03:25] now and Isaac entreated the Lord for his
[2:03:28] wife because she was Barren and the Lord
[2:03:31] was inre of him and Rebecca his wife
[2:03:34] conceived and the children struggled
[2:03:36] together within her and she said if it
[2:03:39] be so why am I thus and she went to
[2:03:41] inquire of the Lord and the Lord said
[2:03:44] unto her two nations are in thy womb and
[2:03:46] two manner of people shall be separated
[2:03:49] from thy bowels and the one people shall
[2:03:51] be stronger than the other people and
[2:03:53] the Elder Shall Serve the younger

[2:05:06] people one shall be stronger than the
[2:05:09] other two
[2:05:13] Nations amen may God bless you you
[2:05:18] may
[2:05:20] uh there always has been something about
[2:05:23] child
[2:05:26] birth there has always been something
[2:05:28] about child
[2:05:32] birth and um you know that's why I it's
[2:05:36] not a Doctrine but I always prefer I
[2:05:39] told my wife I don't want
[2:05:44] twins because
[2:05:47] twins there's a lot of mystery about
[2:05:49] twins in
[2:05:52] you will never find both twins
[2:05:59] spiritual most of the time in the Bible
[2:06:04] one twin is bad and

[2:06:41] God so I was talking about
[2:06:44] twins before I was rudely interrupted by
[2:06:49] the so um
[2:06:52] usually one is good and one is
[2:06:56] bad who will get into
[2:06:58] it
[2:07:00] culture they usually have
[2:07:04] Traditions around
[2:07:06] twins that they do that if you don't do
[2:07:09] them either both of them will die or one
[2:07:10] of them will
[2:07:13] die even the devil knows that something
[2:07:16] special and my mysterious about
[2:07:22] so person I told my wife I would not
[2:07:23] want to

[2:07:40] B I don't want that
[2:07:43] chance I want to be sure that all our
[2:07:45] children of

[2:09:15] good praise the
[2:09:19] Lord amen two Nations man
[2:09:23] of now I want you to Bress
[2:09:28] yourself
[2:09:32] um because what we are about to get
[2:09:36] into is some good
[2:09:39] things for
[2:09:42] believers I don't I did not plan I did
[2:09:44] not come here planning to preach for
[2:09:48] Long by the way every time my target is
[2:09:51] to preach for 40 minutes to 1
[2:09:55] hour but depending on how you
[2:09:58] pull sometimes I can preach
[2:10:01] longer by the way let me tell you when a
[2:10:04] congregation is cold and
[2:10:07] stretchy and they are not enjoying the
[2:10:09] word two things happen number one the
[2:10:14] preacher will always preach for
[2:10:17] longer that's the truth I don't want to
[2:10:20] explain it
[2:10:22] that's the truth and then another thing
[2:10:25] happens if they are
[2:10:29] receiving enjoying
[2:10:31] the two things one one thing happen the
[2:10:34] preacher will always preach
[2:10:38] [Music]
[2:10:40] short even if it is for three
[2:10:44] hours even if for hours
[2:10:51] understand what I'm
[2:10:52] saying you like you mean you've been
[2:10:55] here for 2
[2:10:58] hours because you felt like it was 30
[2:11:01] minutes because you were
[2:11:04] pulling getting
[2:11:06] drunk and enjoying a drunker does not
[2:11:09] get
[2:11:12] satisfied but if you are not
[2:11:14] drinking you will be so dry and
[2:11:19] stetchy and I will also preach for
[2:11:23] long if it is one hour it will look like
[2:11:27] I preached for
[2:11:28] five you'll be so sleepy and slugish and
[2:11:32] tired you understand church that's why I
[2:11:35] believe in a church on
[2:11:38] fire I believe in enjoying
[2:11:41] church I believe in enjoying a sermon
[2:11:44] when I go to
[2:11:45] church I don't like a preacher who
[2:11:47] preaches me to
[2:11:50] sleep that's why I left my
[2:11:53] denomination I have a preacher who
[2:11:55] preaches me to get
[2:11:58] drunk and I want to preach together with
[2:12:01] him and I assure you even if you you are
[2:12:05] tired if you enjoy the word tiredness
[2:12:09] will live you feel like again you are
[2:12:12] brand
[2:12:13] new you fresh
[2:12:15] again only that your amens are not there
[2:12:22] praise the
[2:12:24] Lord that's what happens so this morning
[2:12:28] let us be ready to fly together even if
[2:12:32] it is for 30 minutes even if for 40
[2:12:35] minutes or 5 hours surely DF we can do
[2:12:39] that hallelujah amen but I don't believe
[2:12:43] in longer
[2:12:45] preachers even these brothers here
[2:12:48] Min the support Ministry
[2:12:51] when I ask them to preach and preach for
[2:12:54] two hours I usually have a big problem
[2:12:56] with
[2:12:57] them but if the people were drunk I have
[2:13:02] no problem with that if it is 5 hours
[2:13:05] are you hearing me let us get drunk this
[2:13:09] morning drunk not with
[2:13:12] alcohol with a spirit
[2:13:15] this hallelujah amen two
[2:13:19] Nations two man of
[2:13:22] people now remember I'm going to be
[2:13:25] doing a lot of quoting
[2:13:27] today as I do most of the times uh
[2:13:31] because I feel that my inspiration comes
[2:13:33] from the
[2:13:35] message and Bible so if I don't
[2:13:40] quote I don't feel
[2:13:42] comfortable but you love it when when we
[2:13:45] quote amen because it blesses our
[2:13:49] souls now this is the epas
[2:13:52] Church talking about the
[2:13:55] twins every
[2:13:59] Revival so here we started with the Book
[2:14:01] of
[2:14:03] Genesis where we see a
[2:14:05] woman the daughter of God married to a
[2:14:09] Son of God
[2:14:11] Isaac but you see she became
[2:14:14] pregnant and gave birth to
[2:14:17] twins but these twins were even fighting
[2:14:21] when they were still in their mother's
[2:14:26] womb these twins were actually two
[2:14:30] different
[2:14:32] [Music]
[2:14:33] seeds two different
[2:14:36] nations two manner of
[2:14:39] people but from the same
[2:14:42] womb so when you hear me saying
[2:14:45] womb I mean
[2:14:48] Church okay I mean Church
[2:14:52] the church called The Church of Jesus
[2:14:55] Christ not everyone that claims to be a
[2:15:00] Christian is the good
[2:15:03] twin no many times the majority are the
[2:15:08] evil
[2:15:11] twins matter of fact you will even see
[2:15:13] the older twin is usually the problem
[2:15:23] that's the truth it's what I
[2:15:25] see but like I said this this is not a
[2:15:29] Doctrine so if you're a
[2:15:32] twin you're the Elder
[2:15:34] twin don't get a problem with me I'm
[2:15:38] teaching something
[2:15:39] spiritual More Than
[2:15:41] Physical okay so you see and um you know
[2:15:46] these these twins were in the same
[2:15:49] womb same
[2:15:52] even from they came life came from the
[2:15:54] same
[2:15:55] father but there were two different
[2:15:58] seeds two different nations two
[2:16:01] different man
[2:16:03] of that's why the Bible says not
[2:16:06] everyone that says Lord Lord shall enter
[2:16:10] in but he that doth the will of my
[2:16:15] father and I believe these twins are in
[2:16:19] every Church
[2:16:23] well if you want many people would want
[2:16:25] to say all these twins are the message
[2:16:27] church and the
[2:16:34] denominations twins every
[2:16:38] church as we shall see says they are in
[2:16:41] every
[2:16:46] Revival even within the Revival of the
[2:16:49] end time message
[2:16:53] which is the last
[2:16:55] Revival you will find you know aspects
[2:16:59] of these
[2:17:01] twin so I want you to be very
[2:17:04] careful and listen today now remember
[2:17:07] each church has its formals and each
[2:17:09] church has its
[2:17:17] spirituals and
[2:17:24] I am the
[2:17:26] spiritual but they are the for they are
[2:17:34] Al I don't know who you are but I want
[2:17:37] to believe I am the
[2:17:40] spirit but they are also
[2:17:43] for thus the twins that's born in every
[2:17:49] Revival and lives every
[2:17:52] Church they started W in this
[2:17:55] age talking
[2:17:58] about that's where they started and it
[2:18:01] ends up can you see that former
[2:18:04] religion there is no difference between
[2:18:07] that and
[2:18:10] Catholicism you know in the days of
[2:18:12] Martin
[2:18:13] Luther Martin Luther was protesting
[2:18:17] against the Roman Catholic Church
[2:18:21] but you see his people became
[2:18:24] fanatic and they started breaking the
[2:18:27] churches the windows the mold and
[2:18:30] everything the miracle of his work and
[2:18:33] reformation and Revival if you want to
[2:18:35] call it that
[2:18:39] way the miracle of his
[2:18:45] work was not that he was a powerful man
[2:18:49] and that was not that the Revelation he
[2:18:52] had that they just shall live by faith
[2:18:57] alone it was actually the
[2:19:01] ability of staying under that fanatism
[2:19:05] or over that
[2:19:11] fanaticism he did not accept to be like
[2:19:14] to formalized like
[2:19:18] them he knew the pur of his
[2:19:22] message he stayed with his message he
[2:19:26] never came to bring division or to bring
[2:19:28] hatred of bring
[2:19:31] bitterness but he had a
[2:19:33] message they just shall live by
[2:19:37] faith and so we also have a
[2:19:40] message this message is not meant to
[2:19:42] divide
[2:19:44] churches bring
[2:19:46] bitterness among people but this is a
[2:19:49] Revival
[2:19:51] men to take us to
[2:19:53] Heaven he says every organization is
[2:19:56] butched right into
[2:19:59] it God never did organize his
[2:20:03] church that is exactly what they was
[2:20:06] trying to do
[2:20:08] here and you watch and see how now if
[2:20:11] that isn't right just show you how cast
[2:20:13] an organization
[2:20:16] [Music]
[2:20:18] is listen listen
[2:20:21] carefully God has never organized any
[2:20:27] religion God has never organized any
[2:20:32] church the Church of Jesus is built upon
[2:20:36] revelation of Jesus
[2:20:39] Christ that's the church in
[2:20:41] know when it comes to his church he
[2:20:45] doesn't know Roman
[2:20:47] Catholic he doesn't know
[2:20:49] angan do no PC he does born again he
[2:20:55] does he doesn't know you know all this
[2:20:58] UPC he doesn't even know ENT
[2:21:01] message doesn't know
[2:21:04] dvf he doesn't know
[2:21:06] spe doesn't know evening he doesn't know
[2:21:11] whatever those are just
[2:21:15] organizations those are systems of
[2:21:18] governing
[2:21:22] which the state
[2:21:26] needs Jesus doesn't need
[2:21:30] them his church is never
[2:21:34] organized and by the way this
[2:21:42] mess let me tell you something do you
[2:21:45] know that brother Bam's
[2:21:48] church he started here own
[2:21:52] churched which uh is in America
[2:21:56] in he bought the
[2:21:59] land and he built a physical building
[2:22:01] there at first it was called P
[2:22:05] Pentecostal
[2:22:06] Church CH but then told them
[2:22:10] no they they had to rename
[2:22:14] it to Bram
[2:22:16] Tabernacle tabac do you know the reason
[2:22:18] why God must have used
[2:22:21] them because every message Church in the
[2:22:24] world that believes his
[2:22:27] message would have been called pcal
[2:22:30] Church CH and that's another
[2:22:35] denomination would be in
[2:22:39] Jefferson so he said no I am not going
[2:22:41] to name it that so he named it he said
[2:22:45] in other words Bram Tabernacle who names
[2:22:46] this churcham Tabernacle
[2:22:57] it is
[2:22:58] weird imagine if we call
[2:23:02] ours to show you it is not about a
[2:23:06] man is about the
[2:23:09] message there are people all over the
[2:23:12] world that believe this message in every
[2:23:16] country oh did you see how many saw that
[2:23:19] video of those news
[2:23:22] okay a few I realize many people don't
[2:23:25] check their Church WhatsApp or they
[2:23:26] don't
[2:23:27] care
[2:23:29] go someone sent it to me and they said
[2:23:33] you were on on our
[2:23:37] TV brother get connected please quickly
[2:23:40] so that I was on their
[2:23:43] TV our church was on that
[2:23:46] TV so they they their French speakers
[2:23:52] so they put up you know this it's a
[2:23:55] channel and this channel they kind of
[2:23:58] listen to a lot of um uh you know news
[2:24:01] from all over the world and blah blah
[2:24:03] blah and I think the owners are
[2:24:05] believers of the
[2:24:07] message so they go Bringing news from
[2:24:11] all over the
[2:24:12] world I don't know them anyway so I just
[2:24:16] saw this video and um it is um you know
[2:24:19] they were giving new about our
[2:24:22] church days of the voice Fellowship the
[2:24:25] so and
[2:24:26] so and you know they were hosting a
[2:24:30] Vista you know and they were worshiping
[2:24:33] they were they Believers of the
[2:24:36] message and they are in
[2:24:38] millions and we have many like that all
[2:24:41] over the
[2:24:41] world and yet we don't have a
[2:24:44] headquarter
[2:24:46] any we are not organized into a system
[2:24:53] we are organized out of the
[2:24:57] [Music]
[2:25:00] systems every Revival on Earth has had
[2:25:04] two those
[2:25:08] twins the True
[2:25:10] Vine and the false Vine the true church
[2:25:14] the false
[2:25:15] church and I I wonder which church you
[2:25:18] personally are
[2:25:22] every
[2:25:23] organization has been out of the will of
[2:25:27] God that's why we cannot be an
[2:25:31] organization someone said one time why
[2:25:34] don't you gather all the churches of the
[2:25:38] message and you
[2:25:39] register yourselves it cannot work that
[2:25:43] way because we are not an
[2:25:45] organization we don't operate like one
[2:25:51] if you're going to get an
[2:25:54] organization it means you have to have a
[2:25:57] head and a
[2:26:00] headquarter and your arch
[2:26:02] Bishops
[2:26:04] soon you would see also people wearing
[2:26:08] robes and
[2:26:10] crosses and
[2:26:13] dog saying I'm the bishop of the message
[2:26:15] Church in
[2:26:17] ug in the Pentecostal Church
[2:26:20] they did not used to do
[2:26:22] that they used to preach the gospel
[2:26:26] after an
[2:26:27] experience they used to preach after
[2:26:29] they had an experience and God sent them
[2:26:33] out someone who doesn't even know how to
[2:26:36] read the
[2:26:37] Bible he would go out and read the
[2:26:40] Bible by faith and the Holy Spirit would
[2:26:43] give
[2:26:45] theming and they would go out start a
[2:26:48] church under a tree
[2:26:51] preach preach God heals people people
[2:26:54] begin coming mirac begin
[2:26:57] happening how Pentecostal churches
[2:26:59] started even in
[2:27:02] Uganda but as they became more and more
[2:27:06] they began to
[2:27:07] organize and when they
[2:27:10] organized now they felt like we can also
[2:27:13] be like
[2:27:14] them and now they have robes
[2:27:20] they've gone back to their
[2:27:23] mother but in the message we can never
[2:27:27] operate that
[2:27:28] way we operate by the leadership of the
[2:27:31] Holy
[2:27:34] Ghost they now started using Bible
[2:27:39] colleges but you know at first they
[2:27:41] never
[2:27:42] had even the first Bible colleges they
[2:27:46] started I'll tell you how it was they
[2:27:49] just spend their maybe like a
[2:27:51] week reading how to pray learning how to
[2:27:54] pray and how to heal the sick just a few
[2:27:58] things and then they go out but now they
[2:28:02] have to go and do study
[2:28:05] theology
[2:28:06] psychology a lot of unnecessary
[2:28:10] things and Apostle Paul said the words I
[2:28:13] speak unto you and not from the wisdom
[2:28:16] that man
[2:28:19] teaches and I believe the end time
[2:28:22] message
[2:28:24] church can never have a Bible
[2:28:28] call but you know
[2:28:34] as the people
[2:28:38] organiz but I know the church can never
[2:28:43] organize every Revival produces
[2:28:47] twins Isaac is well represented
[2:28:50] every time there is a
[2:28:52] Revival there is a es born and a Jacob
[2:28:57] born one religious man of the world gets
[2:29:02] tchy and take some Seminary
[2:29:05] experience and the other one wants the
[2:29:08] birthright regardless of how he has to
[2:29:11] get
[2:29:14] it if he has to be a Hool Lord anything
[2:29:17] he
[2:29:20] okay now listen church I want us to
[2:29:24] differentiate the two the
[2:29:26] twins the good one and a bad
[2:29:29] one okay the and ab the and if you want
[2:29:35] to know which one you
[2:29:37] are which one you are leaning
[2:29:39] to I want you to know how
[2:29:44] today we are told here every
[2:29:49] Revival are those two those
[2:29:52] twins in every Revival you we having a
[2:29:56] Revival those twins are still there one
[2:30:00] is
[2:30:02] religious he takes a seminary
[2:30:07] experience and the other one he wants
[2:30:11] something that thing is called the birth
[2:30:16] right tell your neighbor the bir right
[2:30:20] the bir
[2:30:21] right the bir
[2:30:23] right that is what Jacob is looking
[2:30:28] for how to get it he doesn't
[2:30:32] know but if he has to be
[2:30:35] anything he is ready she is
[2:30:39] ready if he wants to be
[2:30:43] a he watch the
[2:30:46] B you know there are many people who say
[2:30:50] and we know the holy spirit is not
[2:30:53] crying
[2:30:55] shouting running up and down and and and
[2:30:59] emotion it is the
[2:31:01] truth but many people who say
[2:31:04] it they say to say we don't need those
[2:31:09] things so that's where they are
[2:31:12] wrong the spirit is not those things yes
[2:31:16] the spirit is the person
[2:31:19] [Applause]
[2:31:20] when you a person let me break this down
[2:31:24] for you what a person you have your own
[2:31:30] characteristics your
[2:31:32] characters the things that make you
[2:31:36] up now when you come in someone
[2:31:40] else that someone else will live like
[2:31:44] you because they have received you so
[2:31:47] the Holy Ghost is the person of
[2:31:50] CHR living in an
[2:31:53] individual he becomes
[2:31:56] you and then he lives his life in
[2:32:00] you that is the evidence of the Holy
[2:32:04] Ghost but you know what when he comes
[2:32:09] and lives in
[2:32:10] you he he he he comes with a lot of
[2:32:15] things
[2:32:17] joy joy is not the Holy Ghost but it
[2:32:19] comes with joy
[2:32:22] you know sh and Fe just had a
[2:32:25] baby were you there when the baby was
[2:32:27] being
[2:32:28] born no this un
[2:32:31] feared but me have been there several
[2:32:33] times there is always
[2:32:38] noise but the noise is not the
[2:32:46] baby but the baby comes with
[2:32:51] noise when you hear the noise then you
[2:32:55] know the baby has
[2:32:57] come amen but also there can be noise
[2:33:01] and the baby is not
[2:33:04] there maybe someone else
[2:33:07] Shou maybe the mother is
[2:33:09] shouting because first is the noise of
[2:33:11] the
[2:33:12] mother so always wash those
[2:33:18] emotions he received it
[2:33:20] maybe not yet maybe that is you
[2:33:25] shouting the mother Begins by
[2:33:32] [Music]
[2:33:34] shouting and then when the baby is
[2:33:37] coming the mother keeps
[2:33:43] [Music]
[2:33:44] quiet and then and when the baby com
[2:33:48] then another
[2:33:53] so you see noise is part of the
[2:33:59] process
[2:34:00] before during and
[2:34:04] after the birth of a child noise is part
[2:34:10] of the whole
[2:34:15] [Applause]
[2:34:16] process and now jaob is the type that
[2:34:20] was is a twin that wanted
[2:34:25] something and that thing was the
[2:34:28] B he was
[2:34:30] determined to receive the bir no matter
[2:34:34] what the requirement
[2:34:36] was if took him rolling on the
[2:34:39] floor or to do anything else he wanted
[2:34:43] the
[2:34:46] B let me tell you you cannot overcome
[2:34:48] your lifestyle
[2:34:52] until you receive the
[2:34:55] bir it is the bir right that changes
[2:34:57] your
[2:34:59] nature the that you know changes
[2:35:02] everything about your
[2:35:05] life you need the
[2:35:07] birth you need the right of the
[2:35:13] firstborn that's what they matter with
[2:35:15] the people
[2:35:17] today they are afraid of that
[2:35:27] I heard somebody said that to get the
[2:35:28] Holy Spirit if I have to shout like that
[2:35:30] then I don't want it I'm put well I'm
[2:35:36] responsible and I began crying mucus
[2:35:38] coming out rolling
[2:35:41] down I don't want that kind of
[2:35:44] spirit he has his
[2:35:47] requirements the way he must get the
[2:35:49] Holy Spirit
[2:35:51] that is not God's way of doing things
[2:35:53] I'm going ahead of myself that's what
[2:35:55] the matter with the people
[2:35:56] today they afraid of the
[2:36:00] birri oh how that how they hate
[2:36:03] that and it produces twins
[2:36:07] every the men of the world they very
[2:36:11] religious
[2:36:13] incline they do good
[2:36:16] arms but just cares nothing about the
[2:36:18] birath
[2:36:20] those two great factions has been
[2:36:22] fighting since the world
[2:36:28] began the ones who don't care about the
[2:36:30] B and the one who are to do anything to
[2:36:33] get the
[2:36:36] B are you filled with the Holy
[2:36:38] Ghost if you are not which side are
[2:36:42] you which twin are you are you the one
[2:36:46] who is looking for the B
[2:36:49] are you the one who doesn't
[2:36:52] care I don't know about you me I want a
[2:36:56] b I'm ready to give up
[2:36:59] everything get
[2:37:02] the amen they are about ready to come to
[2:37:05] to ahead right now something that Jesus
[2:37:08] said they would be so close alike in
[2:37:10] this end
[2:37:15] time they would deceive the very elected
[2:37:18] if it was possible
[2:37:21] it is true you see what a deceiving hour
[2:37:24] that we living
[2:37:26] in stay with the
[2:37:28] word don't leave that word the word will
[2:37:32] speak for
[2:37:35] itself the Jacob
[2:37:38] line will R the
[2:37:40] birth but Jacob and Es were born in the
[2:37:46] same they are both having the same p
[2:37:51] and living in
[2:37:55] theob was
[2:37:57] different when I said we all living in
[2:37:59] the same
[2:38:02] atmosphere you know like we are all in
[2:38:06] church the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit
[2:38:09] we hear the same
[2:38:11] word and we all receive the Same Spirit
[2:38:15] coming upon us the same conviction
[2:38:19] but some will enter
[2:38:22] in others will despise it now let me say
[2:38:26] this you can never receive what you
[2:38:31] despise if you despise
[2:38:33] something you can never
[2:38:37] receive do not tell God how to feel
[2:38:42] you oh God you know how smart I
[2:38:46] am and you know I'm I'm different
[2:38:51] all these people are young
[2:38:52] people me I'm of age when you're feeling
[2:38:57] me don't make me behave
[2:39:01] like ashamed
[2:39:03] among I just want to lift up my
[2:39:06] hand I'm slowly by
[2:39:08] [Music]
[2:39:10] slowly something
[2:39:12] happened in me and then I don't want
[2:39:16] this mess
[2:39:23] I'm coming to you
[2:39:26] wait but Jacob was
[2:39:29] different he had a desire for the
[2:39:32] birth he valued
[2:39:35] it you know don't care how he
[2:39:39] comes be ready to do anything and
[2:39:41] everything he for you to
[2:39:44] do be ready and and ready for him to
[2:39:47] come anywhere he wants to come
[2:39:53] he you should value the birth
[2:39:58] right he knew he needed the bir more
[2:40:02] than everything
[2:40:05] else hearing receiving and acting in
[2:40:07] that message he says now Jacob it meant
[2:40:10] so much to
[2:40:13] him but the birth right me nothing to ES
[2:40:19] way the birthright is the holy
[2:40:23] spirit so frankly he despised
[2:40:27] it and I said this with all
[2:40:30] reference his children
[2:40:33] today but irans his children today are
[2:40:38] still despising the Holy
[2:40:42] Spirit he despises it and they despise
[2:40:46] it why do I have to do that for
[2:40:50] why should I receive the Holy Ghost I am
[2:40:53] as good as you
[2:40:54] are my religion is as good as
[2:40:57] you why should I go through all of
[2:40:59] that that praying
[2:41:03] seeking I'm just as good as you are I go
[2:41:06] to church I've got my name on the boo I
[2:41:10] am so and so that's what you are but
[2:41:14] what are you in the sight of
[2:41:16] God you got to be born
[2:41:20] again you have to be spiritually
[2:41:24] minded so it did not mean anything
[2:41:29] to heed it and they cannot believe
[2:41:34] today they still despise that
[2:41:38] birth and the bir is the holy
[2:41:41] spirit we know that he say and that
[2:41:46] cannot that cannot believe still
[2:41:50] despises the Holy
[2:41:54] Spirit and if you despise the Holy
[2:41:57] Spirit you can never be
[2:41:59] changed you will remain a last full
[2:42:02] woman or
[2:42:03] man you will remain a thief you will
[2:42:07] remain bad you will never be changed but
[2:42:10] you will be a
[2:42:13] religious someone can be in church for
[2:42:17] years very good Christians
[2:42:20] they even dress well but when they are
[2:42:23] rotten
[2:42:24] inside because they have never been
[2:42:26] chained they have never received an
[2:42:29] experience they don't want to to care
[2:42:32] about the
[2:42:33] birri all they care about is what can
[2:42:37] they get in this life they care about
[2:42:41] the
[2:42:42] Portage they care about the porage they
[2:42:44] care about the clothing they care about
[2:42:46] the school they care about the tution
[2:42:49] they care about women and men they care
[2:42:51] about you know their name they care
[2:42:54] about what they have
[2:42:56] accomplished their
[2:42:58] career their houses their land and all
[2:43:02] those things but all that to a child of
[2:43:06] God who is seeking the
[2:43:09] bath to them it is
[2:43:12] nonsense he says whether I
[2:43:14] get or I don't I need a
[2:43:19] I know I need a change I need something
[2:43:22] to come and change my life because the
[2:43:26] Lord I'm very last
[2:43:28] for I need a change by either way there
[2:43:32] is a power called the Holy
[2:43:35] Ghost which saves a sinner can deliver
[2:43:39] you you don't have to fake
[2:43:42] anything you don't have to
[2:43:45] pretend all you have to do is to seek
[2:43:50] amen remember he is seeking
[2:43:53] you more than you are seeking him and
[2:43:56] when you are ready and you are Desiring
[2:44:00] him then he will come and feel
[2:44:04] you and then you live in a
[2:44:06] community and you're different people
[2:44:09] can't understand why you can't do what
[2:44:12] they
[2:44:13] do they say it is nothing it is okay it
[2:44:17] for you you said no
[2:44:19] it is
[2:44:20] not the power for you young man or young
[2:44:24] woman say not your friends comes from
[2:44:28] the Holy
[2:44:31] Spirit it does oh my good Lord it does
[2:44:34] not come from knowing the
[2:44:38] word knowing the
[2:44:40] word comes as an
[2:44:44] addition if you know the word without
[2:44:47] the Holy Spirit you can never even be
[2:44:52] adopted fast things
[2:44:56] fast you have to be first filled with
[2:45:00] the a child has to First be
[2:45:03] born and when you are born now we can
[2:45:06] teach you the principles of the word and
[2:45:10] now you can
[2:45:12] grow full
[2:45:15] adoption the reason why people can't
[2:45:17] believe the word
[2:45:19] because they are not baptized into the
[2:45:21] Holy
[2:45:22] Ghost so they receive the word with
[2:45:25] intellectual
[2:45:29] Faith but not with
[2:45:32] faith the faith of the Son of
[2:45:35] God you need aen the experience with the
[2:45:38] Holy
[2:45:40] Ghost that's what you
[2:45:43] need and the B the holy spirit
[2:45:47] is oh he said the them but you see and I
[2:45:51] cannot believe despises
[2:45:54] that and he says them days are
[2:45:57] pass there is not such a thing as
[2:46:00] receiving the holy
[2:46:02] spirit that was in back in the
[2:46:06] apost is there someone like that here if
[2:46:09] you are here who thought that those days
[2:46:12] are
[2:46:14] passed I'm telling you that is a lie of
[2:46:16] the
[2:46:17] devil are still in those

[3:09:21] a can of Mind wants God to bring the

[3:09:32] brother I believe all two Born Again
[3:09:39] Christians we meet it on God's
[3:09:43] level I don't care what I have to do
[3:09:47] or what I have to
[3:09:48] say now I how I have to
[3:09:52] act the only thing I
[3:09:54] want that means more than
[3:09:59] popularity the only thing is I want
[3:10:03] it that means more than
[3:10:05] popularity that means more than my job
[3:10:08] it means more than my
[3:10:10] mother it means more than my wife more
[3:10:14] than my children every friend
[3:10:18] let me have that bir
[3:10:21] ride I don't care what I have to
[3:10:25] pay I don't care what I have to
[3:10:29] pay I want to meet God on his
[3:10:33] requirement whatever he
[3:10:35] requires if it is to fall in the
[3:10:39] dust if it is to speak with
[3:10:42] time if it is to run through the
[3:10:45] building and I act like a
[3:10:49] stand on my
[3:10:51] head I don't care what it is just so I
[3:10:55] get
[3:10:57] it that is the main
[3:10:59] thing that's the spiritual minded
[3:11:04] people they want the birth
[3:11:09] regardless they want
[3:11:14] it and as soon as they get it
[3:11:18] it sets up the same reaction it was in
[3:11:20] the
[3:11:26] family finally it will come to a place
[3:11:28] till there come a
[3:11:32] separation a man will have to obtain if
[3:11:35] he obtains his birth right he will have
[3:11:36] to separate himself from the
[3:11:40] world just as Jacob
[3:11:44] had my sometimes it means to walk along
[3:11:49] but if you really are
[3:11:51] sincere and you really receive the
[3:11:53] birth don't care to walk
[3:11:57] Al come walk with
[3:12:00] me the way is straight
[3:12:04] and come walk with me I cannot
[3:12:08] walk we are so
[3:12:11] happy when we say we are walking
[3:12:13] alone it means the rest of the world is
[3:12:15] not with us
[3:12:18] but when we say we
[3:12:20] walking Jesus shows
[3:12:23] up and he walks with
[3:12:25] us he walks with me he eats with me with
[3:12:31] me amen amen yes sir let me tell you

[3:16:25] nations of
[3:16:28] people which man of person are
[3:16:33] you as I'm winding down I want you to

[3:17:28] can on your part for God to do
[3:17:31] his and don't rest
[3:17:34] until what difference does it make what
[3:17:37] the people say as long as we are walking
[3:17:38] in the
[3:17:39] [Music]
[3:17:40] spirit and all born of the spirit of God
[3:17:43] are led by the spirit of
[3:17:45] God Sons and Daughters of God are led by
[3:17:49] the spirit
[3:17:51] of always walking in the beautiful light
[3:17:54] of the Holiness and
[3:18:01] clean that bir to him was he was kind
[3:18:04] like the
[3:18:08] world it did not make any difference
[3:18:11] to he thought he was
[3:18:14] religious and Papa and Mama was
[3:18:17] religious and that was good enough for
[3:18:20] you let me disappoint you you are not
[3:18:24] going to heaven because of your mother
[3:18:25] and
[3:18:27] father there may be Believers good
[3:18:31] ones doesn't matter you have to have
[3:18:35] your own
[3:18:40] decision that is the kind of person
[3:18:48] me in my Christian walk I've seen I've
[3:18:51] seen those people a lot of times but
[3:18:55] every time I see them a line I draw a
[3:19:00] line and I tell myself I don't tell
[3:19:03] those people I tell
[3:19:05] myself the decision they have made it is
[3:19:08] not their
[3:19:11] decision they are very
[3:19:13] good in influencing
[3:19:19] you you want to be a believer but you
[3:19:21] fear
[3:19:23] them how will they see
[3:19:25] me I remember my friend told
[3:19:29] me they also part of those stupid
[3:19:32] people now whenever remember
[3:19:35] that you don't want them to see you with
[3:19:37] the
[3:19:39] Bible when you see them
[3:19:45] working when he comes this side you come
[3:19:48] this
[3:19:51] side that is why some they don't car
