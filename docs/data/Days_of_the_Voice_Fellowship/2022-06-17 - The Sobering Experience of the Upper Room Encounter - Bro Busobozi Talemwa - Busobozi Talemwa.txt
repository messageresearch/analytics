matthew chapter four matthias matthew chapter four verse eighteen matthias is as you're opening i want to greet you all in the name of jesus welcome you in the house of the lord this morning amen we are reading verse 18 to 22. maybe and jesus walking by the sea of galilee saw to brethren simone called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers and he said unto them follow me and i will make you fishers of men and they straight away left their nets and followed him and going on from thence he saw other two brethren james the son of zebedee and johnny's brother in a ship with zebedee their father mending their nets and they called them and he they immediately left the sheep and their father and followed him out praise the lord come every way okay so we have let me just put you up to speed on where we have reached with uh our land contributions then we shall get into the scripture we have read this morning it's okay but again uh you contributed fifty three thousand one hundred yeah two hours you should thank god for that come on this is a rebecca maniana rebecca myself then the dvp project our tv project uh sister doctors oninina fedorkas one of the people who were in that first meeting we had at my house but uh she played something and she has continued said firstly fulfilling her uh and i want to say god bless uh brother martin oligar and that brings us to a total as of today of twenty one million one hundred and sixteen thousand [Music] hallelujah and i told you on uh friday was it on friday yes we had a wonderful oven those who really missed you really missed and i told you that uh i we we met we found alan a piece of land and uh i told you that it's a very beautiful land it's flowing with milk and honey and uh i i think it would make a perfect place for the fellowship so and if we delay it will be taken by someone else so i'm informing you but okay is that because i have no one else to inform him so it's up to us take that land attack i'm meeting that man tomorrow again so uh if there is something you can do about it do it to call it so that you can get that line attacking you to the funny i hear some of you say pastor is dreaming um some of you were also saying that when we had zero shillings [Music] hallelujah [Music] but those who are here this morning sure that what i was waiting upon was for you and this morning i'm speaking on a subject missed there suffering okay it is the experience that sobers you oh no so it's a sobering experience you know the word so becomes um we understand it from somebody who's somebody who is not sober is drunk someone who is not so bad cannot does not have clear vision [Music] [Music] [Music] and so this morning entirely i'm asking that you give me your undivided attention and if you do that uh i will not take long seek yeah sit on the edge of your seat you know when someone is telling you something that you're really interested in would you sit on the edge of yours you can't wait to hear more hallelujah amen forget about everything where are we able to let us see what the lord has before they receive the holy spirit [Music] now i want you to praise the lord amen you see they have not been called by the lord jesus but they were by by you know by design all my career they were fishers they were made to be fishers erroneous and you have certain uh qualities no one else has you well now that is before you even receive the holy ghost the other time we'll talk about gifts and callings and calling of god without repentance you don't need to be to repent and receive the holy ghost for you to have a gift you have a gift the moment you were born you have abilities the moment you were born with someone found this man and they were fishers yes and he told them come follow me i will make you fish as a man it is not that fishing that is a problem it is [Music] watching he's listening to music but oh what is that music you know when jesus called us yesterday he did not come to make us dummies but what are you watching my hobby is listening i mean but what kind of music are you listening to so what it is so it's what you are doing and where else follow me and i will make you fish out of me you want intended for them to remain fishers but you want the dame to be fishers of men but [Music] james son of zebedee and john yeah and they were mending their nets and they called them and they immediately left their ship a manga and their father went and followed him to next time we are not here in the church this morning the truth is we had nothing to do we are not serving jesus christ that's who it is because we had nothing to listen to we are worshiping and following jesus because this is what we were meant to do some people say i'm going to serve god because i have nothing i had nothing to do if you are serving god because you have nothing to do time will come and you will get something to do and you will stop serving god i am not not a preacher because i could not do business i am not a preacher because i failed in education you know all those things that the world is doing they were oh you know in business you cannot do a business without a risk does somebody call me remove that away you cannot do a business without uh sacrifice jesus is i don't know how to say that jesus question was not to disappoint their life's goals and purpose jesus did not call you so you become a good-for-nothing person yes is it wrong to go in church every day but you must have something you do now you only know that you must work or you're not calling even just himself what no yes right so he did not call us they are treated to disappoint our life's calls if you're in school continue in school business if you're doing a business and he wanted to realign our expectations about when you didn't realize you did not need politics anymore you realized that god had realized here are the disciples but even in this however realigned their aspirations and that you don't need the world to become great the wake again forecaster [Music] [Applause] not sober now they still wear oh hallelujah they were confusing the fish and the fish you need to enter into my spirit now brother because how can you interpret the fish and the fish unless you understand what i'm talking about right they were they were still confusing the fish of the sea and the [Music] and after these things jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias and on this on on this way showed he himself there were together simon peter and thomas called didmas and nathaniel nathanael of khanna in galilee and the sons of zebedee and two other of his disciples simon peter said unto them i go a fishing they say unto him we are also coming with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing [Music] was the man that jesus had said to go feed and here jesus has died yes we are far and as resurrected but the disciples have not yet met with them amen and peter quickly forgot and he let the disciples back to their old life peter was that man that commanded respect from the others he was intelligent but he was not educated and he told him i want to make you a fish of mine i will use what you have that's what the security now to make to make you do what i want you to do i want to make you a fisher okay without education without a college degree without anything i'll make you what i want it to be foreign this is what i've done all my life and so a peterson peter peterone peter comes out nature and he follows jesus faithfully nowhere for three and a half years he hears the teachings of jesus now he sits under the world for three and a half years even jesus makes him a pastor yes in his absence and time comes when jesus goes away yes we have our peter with the disciples his own life called him so then victory man webb he comes out hallelujah i wanted to look at the scenario hallelujah amina okay so i want you to uh to look at the scenario here i just i just remove you bro so let let's follow here cartographer there was thomas whatever thomas see called didimas what did he move there was nathaniel assange i feel like going to fish wait a moment in the what was he doing from the time jesus called him from the sea oh cool [Music] you remember when jesus called them two by two yes and he sent them out to you remember they were fishing men they were fishing men they were casting out demons m that [Music] you will come to [Music] is [Music] [Music] let me come back and fish with god [Music] no matter what you are doing never watching my teacher if you do not have an experience of the upper room it will not prosper if you think you are doing what you're doing because [Music] you we just read it you just saw me they were fishing all night they were throwing here i told them no no no no no according to my [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] and actually if you pay your trip to get something you [Music] [Music] and then go back and do his own thing they went there all night again they cast the nets they cast [Music] was it because [Applause] the moment jesus made them yes [Applause] and they went that will never happen back to your own life hallelujah amen despite your experiences at sea no more in the world hallelujah it is not just a story situ ghetto it is a reality man they caught nothing they were meant to be fishers they were meant to be many fishes not fish fishes [Music] it is important to understand that if you are you are of the code you cannot prosper by leaving your own aspiration and lifestyles not [Music] hallelujah because of that inspiration came to me when the morning was now come i am a child for god to come but when the morning was done time comes what do you have to do when you are back sleeping the morning bye and bye when the morning but when the morning now comes i'm a child we gotcha let me tell you morning is coming for somebody i'm a child morning is coming for summer amen when the morning now comes oh jesus yes hallelujah amen do you think that jesus does not know all things foreign jesus knows [Music] because he wants you to know your condition he wants you to understand you need it he wants you to admit i cannot kill you i have not faith that [Music] might as well interpret that for what it says on the right not the wrong side the right side of the ship amen what's the right side of it what is the right right side of the street it is the side of the water it is the side of the hole [Music] [Music] do you really think the whole night when i was a child peter did not even think of casting on the right side of the street so there is a song which says if god says no nobody can say the bible says they called a multitude of fishes malachi malakai chapter three malachi is accepted okay is it chapter three will a man rob god which verse is that create okay yeah verse eight managers will a man rob god yet he will a man drop god for my business businesses actually i'll give later yeah i will not give tithes this month it does even the pastor need it after all your name is all your blessings come from drop god yes you have robbed me but you say well how are we robbed backwards as an offering with the curse for you abruptly praise the name of the lord amen and not as church these people they cast the whole night but they didn't get nothing i went to my natural neighborhood but when jesus came yesterday they cast their necks and the bible says they were not able to draw now when simon peter had that it was the lord he got his fishes caught unto him for he was naked and he did cast himself into the sea simone petrova i love peter peter is the same man who told jesus you will not wash my feet again is [Applause] you [Music] so but they now needed the word to be made manifest in them so they to sum them up so they can understand their own they can stand on their own praise the lord verse 8 and the other disciples came in and in a leadership for they were not far from the land but as it were 200 cubits dragging the net with fishes what is fish fish is representing
