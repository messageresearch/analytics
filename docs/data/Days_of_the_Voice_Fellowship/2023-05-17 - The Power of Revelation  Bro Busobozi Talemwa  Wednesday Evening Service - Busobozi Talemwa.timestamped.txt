[28:34] chapter 16. today
[28:39] verses 13 to 21.
[28:44] [Music]
[28:48] and I'm reading in the name of Jesus
[28:50] Christ
[28:52] [Music]
[28:54] when Jesus came into the costs of
[28:56] kaiseria Philippi he asked his disciples
[28:58] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[29:01] man am and they said some say that thou
[29:04] art John the Baptist some Elias and
[29:06] others Jeremiahs or one of the prophets
[29:08] he said unto them but whom say ye that I
[29:12] am and Simon Peter
[29:16] answered and said Thou Art the Christ
[29:19] the son of the Living God and Jesus
[29:22] answered and said unto them blessed are
[29:24] thou Simon but Jonah for flesh and blood
[29:26] as we not revealed it unto thee but my
[29:29] Father which is in heaven and I say unto
[29:31] thee that thou art Peter and Upon This
[29:34] Rock I will rebuild my church and the
[29:36] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[29:38] it and I will give unto thee the Keys of
[29:41] the Kingdom of Heaven and also
[29:43] whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth
[29:45] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[29:47] thou shall lose on Earth shall be loose
[29:50] in heaven then charged he is the
[29:52] disciples that they should tell no man
[29:53] that he was Jesus the Christ
[29:59] summer
[30:42] [Music]
[30:50] [Music]
[30:59] foreign
[31:36] it's now this evening as usual when I'm
[31:39] ministering to uh the Saints on Zoom we
[31:43] do not go more than one hour
[31:49] [Music]
[31:50] if I I don't get done with the subject
[31:53] we shall carry on on Sunday the Lord
[31:55] willing
[32:00] on the power of Revelation
[32:04] the power of Revelation
[32:07] so there is a power of Revelation
[32:10] so in this in this scripture here Jesus
[32:13] asks the disciples a question
[32:18] and he said who do you say who do people
[32:21] say that I the son of man um
[32:25] and so they said some say your John some
[32:28] say you're Elijah some say you're
[32:30] Jeremiah or one of the prophets
[32:35] but then he said what about you
[32:38] this is what they call me what about you
[32:40] what do you call me
[32:42] who do you say that I am
[32:45] and remember that these people had been
[32:47] with Jesus for almost three years now
[32:52] but many of them did not know who he was
[32:57] not that they did not know who he was as
[33:01] a man
[33:03] they knew he was Jesus the son of Joseph
[33:05] the son of Mary yes
[33:10] but that was common knowledge
[33:15] but you see there was something that was
[33:18] needed more than that common knowledge
[33:25] and I'm telling you there is always
[33:27] power in Revelation
[33:30] when you receive the Revelation or a
[33:34] revelation about something
[33:37] usually something is about to happen
[33:42] when you were in the middle of a
[33:44] breakthrough
[33:46] and you don't have Revelation about what
[33:49] is happening
[33:51] you will always miss your visitation
[33:55] because you have no Revelation
[33:57] and so these people knew that he was
[34:00] Jesus
[34:02] and they knew that he was a Jew
[34:05] and they knew that he was a good man
[34:08] they knew he was a good teacher
[34:10] but maybe none of them had a revelation
[34:17] something that that he only and God knew
[34:23] yeah
[34:25] and maybe others also because many of
[34:28] them were saying it's just one of the
[34:29] prophets
[34:32] and that was true Jesus was one of the
[34:35] prophets
[34:36] they said maybe others to the ex and
[34:39] they said maybe it's Elijah
[34:43] because the things that Jesus was doing
[34:47] was exactly in the line of the other
[34:50] prophet
[34:52] and if you know the scriptures
[34:55] Jesus is the son of man me in the son of
[34:58] man Ministries
[35:00] was a prophet because he as uh as God
[35:06] he manifests himself in three offices of
[35:09] a son of a son
[35:28] [Music]
[35:46] [Music]
[36:08] salvation will be finished
[36:12] let me tell you salvation is only going
[36:13] to be on the earth
[36:16] when God is still as a son of
[36:24] [Music]
[37:17] and Jesus
[37:19] all right now verse 16. and Simon Peter
[37:22] answered and said Thou Art the Christ
[37:24] the son of the Living God
[37:28] Christ
[37:32] that Revelations
[37:47] Peter spoke a higher Revelation
[37:51] Peter said yes
[37:54] yes
[38:01] you are the Christ himself
[38:08] Jesus was God in flesh yes
[38:11] that was a revelation which came from
[38:13] God
[38:17] but God revealed it to him
[38:37] [Applause]
[39:18] was Peter
[40:18] foreign so when they when the Catholics
[40:21] sovereign
[41:32] was the pastor of the Church of which I
[41:35] am a member
[41:38] we are in the church where Peter was
[41:42] we believe the same message Peter
[41:44] believed
[41:45] so if Peter was a Catholic
[41:48] which means we are the best Catholic
[41:52] but they are not possible because they
[41:55] fell away from the truth the gospel and
[42:00] Peter preached again
[42:02] and the Protestants they say
[42:05] that oh no it wasn't Peter The Rock was
[42:10] Jesus
[42:11] because you know Jesus is a rock um
[42:18] Peter was there rather Jesus was the
[42:21] rock yes where he built his own church
[42:25] but then the prophet of Our Generation
[42:28] God gave him a higher Revelation
[42:32] I said thank God for Revelation yeah
[42:47] who Jesus was always
[42:52] if you understand it say amen
[42:56] hallelujah [ __ ] Jesus told Peter yes
[42:59] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[43:02] you
[43:03] my Father in Heaven has revealed
[43:07] revealed
[43:09] my father's revealed
[43:11] my father's revealed to you who I am
[43:15] and Upon This Rock
[43:18] meaning abundance
[43:21] [Applause]
[43:50] God himself
[43:54] foreign
[44:30] the revelation
[44:34] when you have that relationship
[44:36] about anything
[44:38] you are sure
[44:41] to Victory
[44:43] now the scripture in Hebrews 11 6 says
[44:46] without faith
[44:51] that is
[44:56] meaning to please God
[44:58] cannot be pleased
[45:03] if you don't have
[45:08] [Applause]
[45:35] [Applause]
[46:02] the possess our faith
[47:00] [Music]
[47:03] teaching of some system now
[47:48] thank you when we say Peter
[47:51] what did Peter received Peter received
[47:55] Revelations
[47:56] what was that that was faith
[48:06] you get it
[48:10] who are you you're a human being
[48:13] can you prove it
[48:16] foreign
[48:21] [Applause]
[48:57] [Music]
[50:19] you ever have faith it is given to you
[50:22] by the grace of God
[51:24] foreign
[52:24] foreign foreign
[52:31] by the word of God
[52:34] it could be a Muslim Obama it could be a
[52:38] Catholic
[52:40] I don't care what religion
[52:43] if they they receive revelation
[52:46] of that scripture
[52:50] you may be a message
[53:06] that brings coins in the church
[53:08] [Applause]
[53:11] and yet you have enough
[53:13] you are the kind women that thinks about
[53:16] yourself only
[53:18] you are the kind that feels even want to
[53:22] give ties
[53:23] you are giving your money you have no
[53:27] Revelation
[53:28] that is a blessing
[53:32] there is a blessing
[53:35] let me tell you all you need is
[53:38] spiritual Revelation
[53:40] when you receive that Revelation
[53:49] I must leave you know not as though I am
[53:53] poor but as though as I have Siri
[53:57] the Bible says listen to me they buy the
[54:02] scripture tells us we shall beheads
[54:07] can you say Amen to that gamma Amina
[54:10] foreign
[54:16] he says we shall learn to again
[54:22] that is scriptures
[54:24] you can read it all the days of your
[54:26] life
[54:28] and still live a defeated life
[54:31] if it is
[54:42] somebody who gives with Revelation
[54:45] you will even see them they keep cheer
[54:49] free a wire the Bible says God loves a
[54:52] cheerful Giver
[54:54] not giving oh he has taken my sins
[55:03] they're telling us to support someone
[55:12] but a very poor person
[55:15] and you'll find a Muslim out there
[55:19] practicing the law of God
[55:22] foreign
[55:40] it is because of lack of Revelations
[55:46] God promised to bless you God promise to
[55:52] increase
[55:55] this is a spiritual promise
[55:59] and it is a spiritual law
[56:03] the only thing you need
[56:05] is to tap into it by revelations
[56:30] you are
[56:33] now
[56:34] why do people listen
[56:37] why do people after them I want to make
[56:40] use of it
[56:41] why do people foreign
[57:00] they pay a lot of cash buy wire sentence
[57:03] and then the man anoints them with oil
[57:07] that's the power so-called holy water on
[57:10] them
[57:12] how does they feel I think I am under a
[57:15] curse
[57:17] that's why I am sick that's why I'm like
[57:20] this let me go to a man of God
[57:24] who has special anointed
[57:30] let him touch me
[57:36] it is lack of Revelation
[57:41] you don't need to pay your money
[57:44] go for someone to break a cast
[57:48] don't just look at me if you're
[57:50] believing what I'm saying say Amen to
[57:51] the world
[57:53] foreign
[58:16] is there a sickness he cannot heal worry
[58:19] you can heal diabetes
[58:22] HIV you can you can heal madness
[58:27] he can heal all this
[58:29] sicknesses
[58:38] are you hearing me how many believe that
[58:41] here
[58:42] our God can do that our God can deliver
[58:46] people
[58:54] but why do we still love people
[58:57] take advantage of others
[59:07] and what the Bible says
[59:11] there shall be many false prophets is
[59:16] revelation
[59:46] you can even come and I pray for you
[59:52] and you go back not die you don't get
[59:54] well know that another person comes they
[59:57] pray for you you go back not die and
[1:00:00] they are not well another person
[1:00:03] it doesn't matter who prays for you
[1:00:06] it is your Revelation
[1:00:09] is your faith you understand faith is a
[1:00:13] revelation
[1:00:15] where you receive a revelation
[1:00:18] Hallelujah but when I go there to
[1:00:21] another game and they pray for me and I
[1:00:23] say I am going to be well it is finished
[1:00:25] till it is done let me tell you when you
[1:00:28] come and they pray for you it will be
[1:00:31] finished
[1:00:32] because you have the same Revelation
[1:00:36] that woman because the other blood issue
[1:00:40] what did she receive yes
[1:00:50] nobody told her go and touch the hymn of
[1:00:54] Jesus
[1:00:56] but you can say something
[1:01:00] what was that Sam it was revelation
[1:01:06] is a Hallelujah she could not see that
[1:01:10] something
[1:01:11] she could not feel that something but
[1:01:14] something told her you go to Jesus
[1:01:18] you break and you fight yourself away
[1:01:21] through to him
[1:01:29] she was convinced she was like crazy she
[1:01:34] was like losing her mind to talk to
[1:01:37] somebody somebody would have told her
[1:01:39] yeah
[1:01:50] even if you try how can you reach where
[1:01:54] he is
[1:03:05] and then finally
[1:03:10] my ears
[1:03:13] is
[1:03:28] [Music]
[1:04:17] [Laughter]
[1:04:19] foreign
[1:04:50] he has no faith that he's going to make
[1:04:52] it no Revelation he has no inspiration
[1:04:56] what is he going to do he will win it
[1:05:00] this woman if she didn't have what she
[1:05:03] had
[1:05:05] enough even if jesus carried her yes it
[1:05:09] would mean nothing
[1:05:13] again
[1:05:33] if I could
[1:05:36] buttered
[1:05:45] I would be free yeah
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:21] that was the moment
[1:06:35] we make you do things
[1:06:44] if you believe it
[1:06:46] faith will make you do that okay myself
[1:07:05] boom
[1:07:15] the blood is
