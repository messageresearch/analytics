[50:34] our Lord
[50:36] Jesus so today I have a subject that I
[50:39] would like to speak which will be most
[50:41] helpful to the
[50:46] youth most of what I really preach is
[50:48] for the Youth
[50:50] but but today I just have something
[50:53] special in my heart
[50:57] that I believe will help many if they
[50:59] pay
[50:59] [Music]
[51:02] attention by God's
[51:04] grace so we are going to the book of
[51:06] First
[51:08] [Music]
[51:12] Corinthians chapter
[51:21] 6 and we are reading vers 17
[51:28] and uh we shall read up to vers
[51:33] 20 um maybe to get the whole
[51:38] um thing we can
[51:43] begin from vers
[51:50] 15
[51:52] amen we read in the name of Jesus
[51:56] know ye not that your bodies are the
[51:59] members of Christ shall I then take the
[52:02] members of Christ and make them members
[52:06] of ANH halot God
[52:19] forbid
[52:21] what know ye not that he which is joined
[52:25] to an harot
[52:27] is one
[52:28] body is one body for two sayith he shall
[52:33] be one
[52:46] flesh but he that is joined unto the
[52:50] Lord is one
[52:55] flesh but he that is
[52:58] joined unto the Lord I missed that last
[53:02] part but he that is joined unto the Lord
[53:04] is one Spirit
[53:10] rather that's verse 17 verse
[53:13] 18 flee
[53:15] fornication every sin that is that a man
[53:19] doeth is without the body but he that
[53:22] committeth fornication sinth against his
[53:24] own body
[53:32] [Music]
[53:37] what know ye not that your body is the
[53:40] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[53:43] which ye have of God and ye are not your
[53:46] own
[53:58] for ye are bought with a price that
[54:02] glorify God in your
[54:04] body and in your spirit which are
[54:16] godess does it stop there
[54:19] yeah that is not a correct
[54:22] translation you correct it with this KJV
[54:26] for ye are bought with a
[54:29] price therefore glorify God in your
[54:34] body luganda stopped there but he
[54:37] continues and in your
[54:40] spirit which are God
[54:43] is amen be
[54:49] seated I see many are either not yet
[54:52] here or are not here tonight
[54:57] but uh first of all I want to appreciate
[55:00] the the brothers for giving me good
[55:02] sound
[55:05] today thank you so
[55:09] um I would like you to listen
[55:12] carefully to the things we are going to
[55:14] share with you
[55:16] tonight and if you are an
[55:19] adult this will help you as
[55:21] well because then you can be able to
[55:24] guide the younger ones
[55:27] and if you are you also you will be
[55:29] blessed I'm
[55:31] sure and if you are a young
[55:35] youth especially un
[55:37] married even if you're married I'd like
[55:40] you to pay attention to Bible
[55:43] truth now friends I I want us to
[55:47] understand that we are living in the end
[55:50] time we are living at a very difficult
[55:54] uh age
[55:58] where right is seen as wrong and wrong
[56:01] is seen as
[56:02] [Music]
[56:06] right brother Solomon I want you to pay
[56:10] attention you know it's very
[56:14] difficult because it's um a very Fierce
[56:19] age where people no longer have the fear
[56:22] of
[56:24] God where even after hear the
[56:27] word they do not pay attention to what
[56:30] they have
[56:32] heard as the scripture put
[56:35] it that they love
[56:37] pleasure more than they love
[56:40] God and so when you you you put
[56:43] something of pleasure if you talk about
[56:47] football you find that everybody's heart
[56:50] will be warmed up and'll be running up
[56:52] and
[56:54] down in the world and it is so sad that
[56:57] that those Spirits are also beginning to
[56:59] encroach and attack the
[57:03] church and um you know the movie
[57:06] industry the
[57:09] Hollywood and um uh you know the game
[57:13] the the game you know ball games that
[57:15] they do in the
[57:17] world you know usually that is not the
[57:20] fun of
[57:23] Believers even there are certain kind of
[57:25] peppers we should never
[57:28] read you know some kind of
[57:33] magazines you know you find that it has
[57:35] filthy spirits on
[57:38] them and certain things we should never
[57:42] watch there are certain things we should
[57:44] never
[57:45] hear because it has filthy
[57:48] Spirits there are many demons that are
[57:52] released and they have come into the
[57:54] world and then number one purpose is
[57:57] just to come and destroy a
[58:00] generation and take them away from
[58:04] God and control them and and and lead
[58:08] them right to the doers of
[58:11] hell and so but God because of his love
[58:15] and because of his riches in
[58:18] Mercy he sends his word to guide us and
[58:22] to help us now I want you to listen we
[58:25] are living in a time when all the demons
[58:29] put
[58:31] together of all other
[58:34] Generations they are here in our
[58:37] generation did you actually know that
[58:40] the demons which fought in the first
[58:45] generation I put it for you the other
[58:47] time in three horse
[58:49] riders we had the the the the white
[58:51] horse
[58:52] rider the deceiver we had the red horse
[58:55] rider
[58:57] the persecutor of the church and the one
[58:59] that brought death to the church and you
[59:02] have the pale horse
[59:04] rider who is actually now the
[59:09] combination because the p horse
[59:13] rider what he does he brings
[59:16] femine femine to the land and we find
[59:20] that you know the the the people we are
[59:23] not only cuz Dev tried to deceive them
[59:28] he had tried to persecute them but they
[59:30] kept on believing so he decided now to
[59:33] come and take away the word from
[59:37] them so if you feel that you cannot read
[59:40] the
[59:41] word and today I'm going to show you
[59:43] which way he is attacking
[59:45] us if you feel you cannot read the word
[59:49] you don't have love for the
[59:51] word you might be attacked by that P hor
[59:54] Rider spirit
[59:56] whereby it brings
[59:58] femine femine in your in your
[1:00:01] land fine in your heart whereby many
[1:00:04] people are in church but they're dying
[1:00:08] spiritually you find they dead
[1:00:10] spiritually because how can you know
[1:00:12] that someone is dying
[1:00:13] spiritually it's because they do not
[1:00:16] yield the fruits of the
[1:00:19] spirit they're dying they don't have
[1:00:22] life in
[1:00:23] them they have the the the they appear
[1:00:26] to to love the
[1:00:28] word but they don't love the word they
[1:00:31] don't give themselves to the
[1:00:33] word today the 20th
[1:00:36] century is a time of Christians who
[1:00:39] never read the
[1:00:42] word even in church part of the time
[1:00:45] they are not in
[1:00:47] church part of the time you know I I
[1:00:50] thank God it doesn't happen
[1:00:53] here and I pray doesn't ever happen
[1:00:56] you find people are in church but they
[1:00:58] are on
[1:00:59] phone you know actually when you coming
[1:01:02] to church you are supposed to switch off
[1:01:03] your
[1:01:06] phone you know you find people sometimes
[1:01:09] you know they are in in church but the
[1:01:11] phone is vibrating on
[1:01:14] them and then they walk
[1:01:17] out and pick the call and come back
[1:01:20] again to me I think that is a
[1:01:23] disgrace to to you brother it's a
[1:01:26] disgrace is a
[1:01:28] shame because if you come to hear from
[1:01:33] God and God is speaking to
[1:01:36] you and you pause him actually don't
[1:01:40] even pause him you just walk
[1:01:43] away and then you speak to whoever
[1:01:45] you're talking to and maybe they grieved
[1:01:48] you or whatever it is or they told you
[1:01:51] have to come back F and then you you
[1:01:53] will come back switched over
[1:01:57] I believe when we are coming before God
[1:02:00] the Bible says every man that comes
[1:02:02] before
[1:02:03] God must believe that he
[1:02:06] is and if you believe that God
[1:02:09] is you are going to rever his
[1:02:12] pres you're going to give
[1:02:15] time so you come to church your mind is
[1:02:18] made
[1:02:19] up your phone is off and you've come to
[1:02:24] consecrate yourself for the two or 3
[1:02:27] hours and you are not willing to be
[1:02:30] distracted by
[1:02:33] anything anything else can
[1:02:36] wait but where you feed your business
[1:02:38] cannot
[1:02:40] wait I doubt if God's blessing will be
[1:02:44] in so you see it a generation that is so
[1:02:49] fast hurrying to make money Hing to go
[1:02:52] to a place Hing to talk this hurrying to
[1:02:55] do that but but you know we never wait
[1:02:57] on God
[1:02:59] anymore and the devil is also not
[1:03:02] sleeping the devil has try to make us
[1:03:05] busy and by making us
[1:03:07] busy he then takes us away from the
[1:03:10] presence of
[1:03:12] God and we become his
[1:03:15] prayer may God help us never to become
[1:03:18] the prayer of the
[1:03:20] devil praise the name of the Lord and so
[1:03:22] we see that we in a generation
[1:03:25] where we are now attacked by a
[1:03:27] combination of all those three forces of
[1:03:33] Darkness the the white horse
[1:03:36] rider or let me say the spirit of the
[1:03:39] deceiver the persecuting
[1:03:42] spirit and and and the spirit of
[1:03:45] femine both have attacked Our
[1:03:48] Generation and together and you know
[1:03:51] because those three
[1:03:52] colors when you mix them together you
[1:03:56] get
[1:03:57] black
[1:03:59] white
[1:04:01] pale and and and and black and and um
[1:04:05] red you get
[1:04:08] black and we notice that we are living
[1:04:10] in a
[1:04:11] time where it is now nothing but
[1:04:15] [Music]
[1:04:16] death the devil has come in our
[1:04:19] time and he has really come to finish
[1:04:21] our
[1:04:22] generation because he knows some place
[1:04:25] in the says he knows but he has but a
[1:04:27] short
[1:04:29] time the devil knows he has a short time
[1:04:34] but the question is do you
[1:04:36] know do you know how much time you
[1:04:40] have do we know how much time we
[1:04:42] have or we actually do not
[1:04:45] know and just for a correction
[1:04:48] there it was first the deceiver the
[1:04:51] white the white horse
[1:04:53] rider and the persecutor the red hor
[1:04:57] Rider and then the femine which is black
[1:04:59] hor
[1:05:01] Rider so when you mix black red and
[1:05:05] white you get
[1:05:07] P which is actually
[1:05:09] death and so we see that the devil is
[1:05:12] now not planning anything but
[1:05:16] death total removal of the
[1:05:20] believer total Destruction of the
[1:05:23] believer but while he's planning death
[1:05:26] for The
[1:05:28] Believer by the the spirit that is
[1:05:30] attacking
[1:05:31] Israel is the Same Spirit attacking the
[1:05:35] bride you find the in Palestine they
[1:05:38] keep
[1:05:40] shouting and even all over America and
[1:05:44] and in Europe these Palestinians and the
[1:05:46] people who are feeling for
[1:05:49] them they take their flags and they
[1:05:53] begin chanting and shouting
[1:05:55] from The River To The
[1:05:57] Sea you know it's for
[1:06:00] Palestine and what does that mean and
[1:06:03] they said death to
[1:06:05] Israel because you see from the river to
[1:06:08] to to the
[1:06:10] sea that is the whole nation of
[1:06:13] Israel and they're trying to
[1:06:16] claim the whole nation of Israel and
[1:06:19] wipe it out of the
[1:06:21] m and that's the spirit that is
[1:06:24] increasingly coming even in the
[1:06:25] political
[1:06:28] powers that anti-israel
[1:06:32] Spirit but actually did you know that
[1:06:35] even Israel as a
[1:06:37] nation has not actually claimed have
[1:06:39] full
[1:06:41] land if they were to claim the whole
[1:06:45] land you know first of all there is no
[1:06:48] Palestine forget about it because you
[1:06:51] see the Palestinians are
[1:06:53] Arabs you see that land does not belong
[1:06:56] to
[1:06:56] them that land Accord I'm speaking
[1:06:59] according to the Bible according to the
[1:07:02] Bible that land of Palestine was given
[1:07:05] to
[1:07:06] Abraham was by God
[1:07:09] himself you say who who whether there
[1:07:12] were people there or
[1:07:14] not the owner of the land the one with a
[1:07:18] title
[1:07:19] D gave it to Israel and so it belongs to
[1:07:23] them and if you if they to possess their
[1:07:26] whole
[1:07:28] land they're supposed to possess even up
[1:07:30] up to
[1:07:32] Syria leanon and a few other areas there
[1:07:38] and to possess that entire
[1:07:40] area because it belongs to them but they
[1:07:44] are still having just one little
[1:07:47] portion but you know pressure is
[1:07:49] building
[1:07:50] up you know political pressure and
[1:07:53] others to try and Destroy them
[1:07:56] but you see they do not know they cannot
[1:08:00] destroy
[1:08:02] Israel because Israel is a nation of
[1:08:05] God they are the people of God they are
[1:08:09] the people of the
[1:08:10] convenant do you understand church and
[1:08:13] that's why you always have to pray for
[1:08:14] the Peace of
[1:08:16] Israel and Jerusalem we are believers
[1:08:21] that's what we do and we find The Same
[1:08:24] Spirit The Same anti-israel Spirit that
[1:08:28] wants to kill Israel is the same spirit
[1:08:32] that wants to kill
[1:08:34] the to remove her take her to hell but
[1:08:39] the devil does not know that he cannot
[1:08:41] finish this bride it is impossible to
[1:08:44] finish this Bri because we are also
[1:08:46] under a
[1:08:48] conen praise the name of the Lord and so
[1:08:51] it's a time that is a mixture of of many
[1:08:55] demons and
[1:08:58] spirits all
[1:09:00] forces all
[1:09:02] powers that Satan has he's powering them
[1:09:06] out in our
[1:09:11] generation and is targeting the young
[1:09:16] people and today I'm speaking on flee
[1:09:22] fornication flee fornication
[1:09:25] actually I realized this is a much
[1:09:27] bigger
[1:09:29] subject and I tried to speak to some
[1:09:32] youth the other day I think yesterday on
[1:09:36] it on Monday
[1:09:38] actually but I did not get to even touch
[1:09:43] it and so I thought I should speak it
[1:09:45] again here and maybe go a little bit in
[1:09:47] more
[1:09:50] details and so where here he says that
[1:09:52] flee fornication
[1:09:55] Full Stop in other words if you want to
[1:09:59] overcome
[1:10:01] fornication the only way is to
[1:10:04] flee to
[1:10:06] flee now every sin a man doth is without
[1:10:09] the
[1:10:11] body but he that commits
[1:10:14] fornication sins against his own
[1:10:20] body his own body now you say well I've
[1:10:23] sinned against my body
[1:10:26] but remember that body is not your
[1:10:29] body that body is the Temple of the
[1:10:32] Living
[1:10:34] God he says it's the Temple of the Holy
[1:10:37] Spirit which is in
[1:10:39] you which you have of
[1:10:42] God and you are not your
[1:10:47] own for ye are B with a
[1:10:50] price therefore glorify God in your
[1:10:53] body and in your
[1:10:55] spirit so in our body we are supposed to
[1:10:58] glorify God that body is not
[1:11:02] yours it is for the glory of the
[1:11:05] Father the spirit is not yours it is for
[1:11:08] the glory of God so you must glorify God
[1:11:11] in your
[1:11:13] body you must glorify God in your
[1:11:17] spirit now in Ephesians 5
[1:11:23] verse1 it says Be there for followers of
[1:11:26] God as dear
[1:11:29] children and walk in love as Christ also
[1:11:33] has loved us and has given himself for
[1:11:35] us as an offering and a sacrifice to God
[1:11:37] for sweet smelling
[1:11:51] ser and he says but fornication and all
[1:11:57] uncleanness or
[1:11:59] covetousness let it not be once named
[1:12:01] among you as becometh
[1:12:17] sa so now listen listen please this is
[1:12:20] like more like learning on
[1:12:22] this and so now he begins by saying flee
[1:12:27] fornication and he gives you a reason
[1:12:30] and he says all other sins you
[1:12:33] do are out of the body you simply do
[1:12:37] them but when it comes to the sin of
[1:12:40] fornication which is the same as
[1:12:43] adultery when it comes to this
[1:12:45] sin it is a it becomes a part of
[1:12:50] you and he says don't you know you are
[1:12:53] the temples of God
[1:12:56] you you are not your
[1:12:58] own so then here he says walk in
[1:13:02] love as Christ also has loved us and has
[1:13:06] given himself for us as an offering and
[1:13:08] a sacrifice to God for sweet smelling
[1:13:12] Serv and then here he says but
[1:13:15] fornication and all
[1:13:17] uncleanness

[1:16:52] prank and you find a believer also
[1:16:57] pranking young people about to start
[1:16:59] channels so they can also do
[1:17:03] pranks the Bible says pranking or should
[1:17:06] never be mentioned Among
[1:17:11] Us you

[1:17:37] is an idolator has an inheritance in the
[1:17:40] kingdom of God and of of Christ and of
[1:17:42] God
[1:17:44] [Music]
[1:17:58] you a is the same as
[1:18:02] a a
[1:18:04] prostitute you know a person who who has
[1:18:08] dealings with
[1:18:11] prostitutes you know a a sexually prous
[1:18:16] [Music]
[1:18:18] man you see those are war
[1:18:22] mongers and he says no
[1:18:25] M no unclean person no cous
[1:18:30] man who is a cous man or
[1:18:34] person what is
[1:18:37] cous all right sometimes it's good to
[1:18:39] look at what the dictionary
[1:18:43] says having or showing great desire to
[1:18:47] possess something belonging to someone
[1:18:49] else
[1:18:57] you see you do not have a
[1:19:00] dress sister Joan has
[1:19:02] it and you find a sister who is surely
[1:19:09] Desiring to the you find them by the way
[1:19:13] they can almost come and I don't know
[1:19:14] whether you fed some of you but someone
[1:19:18] will come and will literally talk to you
[1:19:22] can you please give me this C
[1:19:25] I really like it I don't know how many
[1:19:28] have ever experienced that that is
[1:19:32] coting it is not yours it is
[1:19:35] theirs but you feel it should be
[1:19:38] yours and you have that great
[1:19:41] desire to possess
[1:19:43] it but the Bible says
[1:19:47] godliness with
[1:19:49] [Music]
[1:19:51] contentment is a great gain
[1:19:55] so in other words you must always as a
[1:19:57] Believer have
[1:20:00] contentment if somebody is wearing good
[1:20:04] suits and you can't afford
[1:20:07] one be contented with what God has given
[1:20:10] to
[1:20:11] you if someone is changing shoes every
[1:20:15] day don't begin blaming them or judging
[1:20:19] them that they they very
[1:20:21] proud brother you are cous
[1:20:25] it is because you feel what they have
[1:20:27] should belong to
[1:20:28] you but really you should be
[1:20:32] contented with what God has given to you
[1:20:35] yours is yours and theirs is
[1:20:38] theirs and God loves both of
[1:20:42] you if you go to God and ask him for
[1:20:45] anything you
[1:20:47] desire that same God who gave them will
[1:20:50] give
[1:20:51] you do not desire what someone else
[1:20:58] has and the Bible says you see no
[1:21:01] wers no unclean person no cous man who
[1:21:06] is an
[1:21:08] idolator has any inheritance in the
[1:21:11] Kingdom of
[1:21:13] [Music]
[1:21:15] Heaven they don't have any inheritance
[1:21:18] in the Kingdom of
[1:21:19] Christ let no man deceive
[1:21:22] you with vain words
[1:21:25] for because of these things cometh the
[1:21:28] wrath of
[1:21:31] God upon the children of
[1:21:35] Disobedience I am so glad we are the
[1:21:37] children of
[1:21:38] Faith but in this world they are also
[1:21:42] children of
[1:21:44] Disobedience when they hear the word of
[1:21:46] God it doesn't bother
[1:21:49] them but I'm a child of faith
[1:21:56] these things cometh the wrath of God
[1:21:58] upon the children of Disobedience be not
[1:22:00] ye that partakers with
[1:22:03] them for you we are sometimes in
[1:22:06] darkness for you we are sometimes
[1:22:10] Darkness but now are ye in the
[1:22:13] light in the are ye light in the
[1:22:16] Lord you you were
[1:22:20] Darkness but now you are
[1:22:22] light he did not say you were in
[1:22:24] darkness and now you are in
[1:22:28] light how many are following me here he
[1:22:31] said you were
[1:22:33] Darkness everybody say I was
[1:22:36] Darkness now say I am
[1:22:38] light so who is
[1:22:41] light I am light so we need to change
[1:22:44] some of these
[1:22:45] songs Jesus is the light of the world
[1:22:48] you are the light
[1:22:50] Hallelujah we are the light we were
[1:22:53] Darkness
[1:22:55] but now we are the
[1:22:57] light in the
[1:22:59] Lord walk as children of
[1:23:02] light because your light walk as
[1:23:05] children of
[1:23:07] light and first Thessalonians
[1:23:10] 4:3 he says for this is the will of
[1:23:13] God even your
[1:23:16] sanctification that you should
[1:23:20] AB at first he said flee fornication
[1:23:24] then secondly he
[1:23:27] said that um
[1:23:30] fornication should not be
[1:23:34] once and now he's saying
[1:23:38] abstain from
[1:23:40] fornication praise the name of the
[1:23:43] Lord now if you were a
[1:23:46] fornicator if you lived and clean if you
[1:23:49] lived in
[1:23:51] filth before you had this message
[1:23:56] and then you hear the message and God
[1:23:59] delivers you and you repent and you
[1:24:02] start
[1:24:03] over from that moment these words are
[1:24:08] yours now we will see what
[1:24:12] happens to those that actually do not
[1:24:15] listen to these
[1:24:17] words having seen the
[1:24:21] light it's very dangerous
[1:24:24] and that's why I thought I should teach
[1:24:25] on this
[1:24:26] subject we should not take this thing
[1:24:30] lightly it's very important and we we
[1:24:33] find people who are taking the grace of
[1:24:35] God in
[1:24:39] vain let us continue here says for this
[1:24:42] is the will of God even your
[1:24:44] sanctification that you should abstain
[1:24:46] from
[1:24:49] fornication that every one of you should
[1:24:52] know how to possess his vessel in sanc
[1:24:54] and
[1:24:59] honor praise the name of the Lord praise
[1:25:02] the name of the Lord do you have your
[1:25:06] vessels where are your
[1:25:08] vessels where are your
[1:25:10] vessels I ask you Church where are your
[1:25:13] vess no one is answering everybody's
[1:25:16] looking at me what is your vessel that
[1:25:19] is speaking about it's talking about
[1:25:21] your
[1:25:22] body your body is Your
[1:25:25] Vessel and he is saying here that you
[1:25:28] should possess your vessel in
[1:25:31] sanctification and
[1:25:33] [Music]
[1:25:36] in your
[1:25:39] body
[1:25:41] yourself actually to even when it comes
[1:25:44] to the
[1:25:45] woman bam says that they given three
[1:25:47] sacred
[1:25:50] virtues which they should never defy
[1:25:54] and which means which a man should never
[1:25:58] Define and you find that it is not only
[1:26:00] talking about the
[1:26:02] woman in there is also the
[1:26:04] man because those sacred
[1:26:07] virtues are connected to the
[1:26:10] man number one it talks about her sacred
[1:26:16] virtue a woman being a
[1:26:20] virgin if you are a virgin and you have
[1:26:24] never seen any
[1:26:25] man you've never had any man in your
[1:26:29] life a prophet says it is a sacred
[1:26:32] virtue you are
[1:26:35] given you are supposed to keep it you're
[1:26:38] not supposed to M it that if you would
[1:26:43] marri before you married when you get
[1:26:46] married or before you get married to
[1:26:47] that man that wants to marry
[1:26:50] you you must confess it to them
[1:26:54] that's how important it
[1:26:56] is and then the other sacred
[1:26:59] virtue is a is a sacred
[1:27:05] Womanhood your body as a woman you
[1:27:09] should you should keep your vessel in
[1:27:13] honor whereby no man just comes and
[1:27:16] touches
[1:27:17] you no man should actually touch
[1:27:20] you the only thing they should do is to
[1:27:23] shake your hand and that is
[1:27:27] all I did not have I only had one amen
[1:27:31] and I said that is
[1:27:34] all amen praise the name of the Lord and
[1:27:38] even to those of you who are following
[1:27:39] us
[1:27:40] online you have to say Amen to this
[1:27:43] because it is the word of God yes no man
[1:27:47] Apostle Paul literally said it no man
[1:27:49] should touch a
[1:27:51] woman but only if they married to you
[1:27:55] let every man have his own
[1:27:57] wife and every woman have her own
[1:28:00] husband to avoid he says
[1:28:05] fornication and I'm speaking on flee
[1:28:08] fornication so then he says you see that
[1:28:10] sacred virtue of
[1:28:13] Womanhood you know you find women in our
[1:28:16] generation the devil has stri them
[1:28:19] naked it's a spirit of the age it's a
[1:28:22] spirit of Hollywood
[1:28:24] it has taken over
[1:28:26] homes it has taken over the
[1:28:28] Internet when you take that
[1:28:31] smartphone you realize it is filled with
[1:28:34] with a lot of those
[1:28:36] fils naked pictures
[1:28:39] everywhere as a Believer you should not
[1:28:41] amen put your eyes on those
[1:28:44] things because the devil is trying to
[1:28:46] address the
[1:28:48] generation first by funing their brains
[1:28:51] and their minds
[1:28:54] accept that this is the new
[1:28:58] normal and you find a woman dressing the
[1:29:00] same way she saw things on the
[1:29:04] internet because the devil has convinced
[1:29:07] her it is
[1:29:09] correct you find them dressing
[1:29:13] show you find them dressing you know B
[1:29:17] show press show they they have dressed a
[1:29:22] very long dress but their breasts are
[1:29:27] outside as if they going to breast
[1:29:29] feet it's a spirit of the ede it's a
[1:29:34] of a Believer should not be found in
[1:29:37] such
[1:29:38] things your body you have sacred
[1:29:43] Womanhood your body
[1:29:45] sa you must keep it that
[1:29:48] way the Bible says a man that looks at a
[1:29:52] woman last after her has committed
[1:29:56] adultery already with
[1:29:58] her and what happened to
[1:30:02] David it was
[1:30:04] B that opened the
[1:30:07] curtain she went
[1:30:09] showering and as she was showering her
[1:30:12] curtain was
[1:30:13] open and when David
[1:30:17] saw he was tempted over to
[1:30:20] her and that's why I'm saying sisters
[1:30:23] cover your
[1:30:25] curtain Hold Your Vessel in
[1:30:29] hor in the same same way men should do
[1:30:32] the same thing your body is not a a
[1:30:35] filthy
[1:30:37] place don't hold it in this
[1:30:40] horor hold your body in
[1:30:43] h amen your hands in hor where are your
[1:30:46] hands
[1:30:47] touching you find your hands amen taking
[1:30:51] on the west of a woman who is not your
[1:30:55] wife oh you have held your body in this
[1:30:59] H you find them these days they they
[1:31:03] dress as if they powered them in some
[1:31:05] kind of
[1:31:07] trousers and a man begins to walk like a
[1:31:11] god is a spirit of the
[1:31:14] age amen I'm here speaking not my own
[1:31:18] behalf amen but it's the voice of the
[1:31:20] Holy Ghost to
[1:31:22] us and we you young people should not be
[1:31:25] overtaken in those
[1:31:27] demons yes they are demons that's what
[1:31:30] it is because they are here today on
[1:31:34] Earth but you can't see them but you see
[1:31:37] what they
[1:31:42] doing we have to have our open
[1:31:45] eyes to see what we are fighting with if
[1:31:49] we do not know what we we are
[1:31:51] fighting then we will not know how to
[1:31:53] direct weapons of our
[1:31:57] Warfare he says abstain from
[1:32:00] fornication that every one of you should
[1:32:04] know you see you should know how to
[1:32:08] possess your
[1:32:11] vessel in
[1:32:15] sanctification
[1:32:17] and not in the
[1:32:20] last of consup
[1:32:25] well I need to give you a definition
[1:32:27] here of means sexual
[1:32:32] desire not in the last of sexual
[1:32:37] desire even as the Gentiles which know
[1:32:40] not
[1:32:42] God he says the Gentiles they don't know
[1:32:46] God that's why they always
[1:32:50] last last but let me tell the only way
[1:32:53] to defeat the of
[1:32:55] last is to use the word of God
[1:32:59] upon praise the name of the Lord praise
[1:33:03] the name of the Lord and I was telling
[1:33:05] the other young people the other
[1:33:07] day on the SK I
[1:33:09] watched and and this man was coming he
[1:33:13] was saying telling the God I'm very
[1:33:16] lustful help
[1:33:18] me and the girl told him you know I have
[1:33:21] this disease and this one and
[1:33:24] and when I go with you this and this
[1:33:26] will
[1:33:28] happen the last of the man
[1:33:31] disappeared it disappeared and R away
[1:33:36] how much
[1:33:37] more if you sisters can use the
[1:33:40] word hallelujah the word of God will
[1:33:44] defeat the Devil in any place any time
[1:33:48] in any situation someone comes with a
[1:33:52] spirit of last
[1:33:54] begin to use the word that's why stop
[1:33:57] stop stop don't stop keep using the word
[1:34:02] and you speed leaving
[1:34:05] them and I've told you even here younger
[1:34:09] people who don't who have the spirit of
[1:34:12] this
[1:34:14] last and not and intending to go into
[1:34:19] fornication they go to
[1:34:21] sisters who are also ANC
[1:34:25] expecting and they they they begin
[1:34:27] leading them into talks and
[1:34:30] conversations and they deceive them they
[1:34:32] going to
[1:34:34] Mar this is what you see in the
[1:34:38] world a man is
[1:34:40] married but he's very busy disturbing
[1:34:43] her secret his
[1:34:46] secretary and he's telling the secret
[1:34:48] the woman at work
[1:34:50] whatever wife I don't love her
[1:34:54] as a matter of fact I'm just waiting for
[1:34:56] the right
[1:34:57] time to do a
[1:35:00] divorce and this woman is
[1:35:02] deceived she's thinking that actually he
[1:35:06] doesn't love his
[1:35:08] wife and they going to marry her it's
[1:35:12] deception and find they are not even
[1:35:14] fearful to begin talking with men who
[1:35:18] are
[1:35:19] married because they're deceived I hope
[1:35:22] that Believers Never get to that
[1:35:25] level but even in the church I believe
[1:35:30] if a man or brother is
[1:35:32] serious and he really intends to marry
[1:35:35] you as a
[1:35:36] sister he cannot come to you without
[1:35:40] going to the pastor
[1:35:41] F and if you also open your doors for
[1:35:45] them then things are going to happen and
[1:35:48] you're going to be
[1:35:49] heartbroken but you see he's to
[1:35:52] blame but you are also to
[1:35:54] blame because we we here in the church
[1:35:57] we've taught you very
[1:35:59] well and I hope that you Brothers one
[1:36:03] brother told me oh Pastor now if I come
[1:36:05] to you have to be very very
[1:36:08] sure well if you're very very sure why
[1:36:10] are you coming to me
[1:36:14] begin you are coming to me because you
[1:36:17] have a thought but you are not very very
[1:36:20] sure you are seeking for guidance
[1:36:24] and that's why you come to the pastor's
[1:36:26] office to be guided to be instructed in
[1:36:30] the word of
[1:36:32] God to be prayed with for you to seek
[1:36:35] after the will and mind of
[1:36:38] God praise the name of the Lord now I
[1:36:42] want to show you something here in the
[1:36:45] book of First Corinthians if you can
[1:36:46] turn with
[1:36:53] chapter
[1:36:55] [Music]
[1:37:02] 10 now these things were our examples to
[1:37:06] the intent we should not last after evil
[1:37:09] things as they also
[1:37:20] [Music]
[1:37:21] lasted neither be ye idolators as were
[1:37:25] some of them as it is written the people
[1:37:28] sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to
[1:37:31] play neither let us commit fornication
[1:37:34] as some of them committed and Fa in one
[1:37:36] day 3 and 20,000 neither let us tempt
[1:37:40] Christ as some of them also tempted and
[1:37:42] were destroyed of serpents
[1:38:15] now here Apostle
[1:38:17] Paul takes uh the scripture in the Old
[1:38:22] Testament show us and emphasize how
[1:38:25] fornication is
[1:38:31] deadly and he says that um you know
[1:38:35] these people uh the things were written
[1:38:38] for our
[1:38:41] examples to the intent that we should
[1:38:43] not last after evil
[1:38:46] things as they also
[1:38:48] lasted neither be ye idolators
[1:38:53] as we some of them and it is written the
[1:38:56] people sat and by the way the spirit of
[1:39:00] immorality go with a spirit of
[1:39:03] idolatry do you know
[1:39:05] that the spirit of
[1:39:07] immorality goes with a spirit of of of
[1:39:11] idolatry you find that this man or this
[1:39:14] woman is is so or she's so
[1:39:19] intoxicated with the desire with the
[1:39:22] last after so and
[1:39:24] so that they can do literally
[1:39:29] anything for
[1:39:31] them something they don't even do for
[1:39:33] their
[1:39:34] people for their mother for their wife
[1:39:37] for but if they are intoxicated with
[1:39:39] this
[1:39:40] Spirit you will find that they are
[1:39:42] almost worshiping this
[1:39:45] person a of
[1:39:47] idol and it moves with the spirit of
[1:39:49] immorality
[1:39:53] I'm setting these things down for you
[1:39:54] here
[1:39:56] tonight you find that this person you
[1:39:58] love them more than you are willing to
[1:40:01] obey the
[1:40:03] word you love them to the extent that
[1:40:06] you are willing to break the word of God
[1:40:08] for
[1:40:10] them I can actually literally do
[1:40:12] anything for
[1:40:14] you I can I can I can just even minut to
[1:40:18] go to the
[1:40:18] moon but the word of God says this first
[1:40:22] leave that one
[1:40:25] that you were already committing
[1:40:29] idolatry and these people were
[1:40:32] idolators as it is written the people
[1:40:34] sat down to eat and
[1:40:36] drink and they rose up to play and he
[1:40:40] says neither let us commit
[1:40:42] fornication as some of them
[1:40:45] committed and in one day 3 and 20,000
[1:40:54] let us go there and see what
[1:40:57] happened in the Book of Numbers this is
[1:40:59] what Apostle Paul is talking
[1:41:06] about I trust you are closely following
[1:41:08] this with
[1:41:11] me numbers
[1:41:16] 2 vers says if you we can the whole
[1:41:19] chapter is very good you can read the
[1:41:21] whole chapter when you get home
[1:41:24] but I'd like us to begin from vers
[1:41:30] six
[1:41:32] yes and behold one of the children of
[1:41:34] Israel came and brought unto his
[1:41:38] Brethren a Midian itish woman in the
[1:41:41] sight of Moses and in the sight of all
[1:41:43] the congregation of the children of
[1:41:45] Israel who were weeping before the door
[1:41:47] the of the Tabernacle of the
[1:41:49] congregation and when finans the son of
[1:41:51] elazar the son of Aaron priest saw it he
[1:41:54] rose up from among the congregation and
[1:41:56] took a javeline in his hand and he went
[1:41:59] after the man of the of Israel into the
[1:42:00] tent and thrusted both of them through
[1:42:03] the man of Israel and the woman through
[1:42:06] her belly so the plague was stayed from
[1:42:08] the children of Israel and and those
[1:42:10] that died in the plague were 2 and 4,000
[1:42:14] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[1:42:16] Finas the son of elazar the son of Aaron
[1:42:19] the priest has turned my WTH away from
[1:42:22] the children of Israel while he was
[1:42:23] zealous for my sake among them that I
[1:42:26] consumed
[1:42:27] not the children of Israel in my
[1:42:30] jealousy you can read up to vers
[1:42:52] 11 for
[1:43:40] now uh probably sometime soon I'll speak
[1:43:43] to you on the spirit of Bal
[1:43:47] bism or the spirit of balam now we find
[1:43:51] that bism is a very interesting
[1:43:55] spirit it's a spirit that loves
[1:43:58] money and a spirit that will you know do
[1:44:00] anything for
[1:44:02] money and you find that balam was a
[1:44:05] prophet a man who was anointed rather
[1:44:08] having a gift of
[1:44:11] God and and king
[1:44:15] bar tried to bribe
[1:44:19] him with with goods and gold and silver
[1:44:25] and and clothes and told him I'm going
[1:44:28] to make you great I'm going to make your
[1:44:30] name great the only thing I want you to
[1:44:33] do for me is go and cast those people
[1:44:37] isra that's what the devil is going to
[1:44:41] do the devil is going to raise
[1:44:44] preachers these men are
[1:44:46] anointed with a right anointing by the
[1:44:49] way they are preachers they are called
[1:44:52] by God
[1:44:54] but the devil perverts them to begin
[1:44:57] speaking on his
[1:44:59] behalf and we have them in our
[1:45:02] generation these are the ones I was
[1:45:03] speaking about the other
[1:45:05] day men who crept in
[1:45:08] unaware they anointed they can talk they
[1:45:12] can convince you know because they are
[1:45:14] trying to speak what the people want to
[1:45:18] hear so that they can get what people
[1:45:20] will give them
[1:45:23] they are not Servants of God they are
[1:45:25] Servants of men of their
[1:45:28] bellies the Bible says they are servants
[1:45:30] to their own
[1:45:32] b as long as they're going to get
[1:45:35] money as long as they're going to get
[1:45:37] people to follow what they saying then
[1:45:41] they will preach whatever people want to
[1:45:43] hear and that's why by the those people
[1:45:46] they cannot rest until they have mega
[1:45:50] churches but our calling in the mage
[1:45:54] is not to have mega
[1:45:56] churches our calling in this message is
[1:45:59] to have a bride amen who is Sanctified
[1:46:03] who is prepared for the coming of the
[1:46:06] Lord this is a Rapture message
[1:46:09] friends it's not a a message to call a
[1:46:13] multitudes if the if they bride in this
[1:46:16] place is a
[1:46:18] thousand they will come and actually
[1:46:21] says that none of them
[1:46:23] will be taken out of his hands they will
[1:46:26] come the devil cannot resist any of them
[1:46:30] but that is not our
[1:46:33] calling you know what they have in their
[1:46:36] mind is they have to
[1:46:38] preach so I can get
[1:46:43] money that's why that time of
[1:46:46] giving is very sa for
[1:46:49] them very very SA
[1:46:53] they will talk million
[1:46:55] words and they will massage the
[1:47:00] people so that they can come and
[1:47:03] give they will take one hour collecting
[1:47:08] offering it's not free will offering
[1:47:12] anymore it is an offering the massage
[1:47:14] out of
[1:47:16] you but an offering is supposed to come
[1:47:19] out of your
[1:47:20] heart and out of Revelation
[1:47:23] and out of your desire to serve
[1:47:26] God praise the name of the Lord amen and
[1:47:30] we
[1:47:30] see balam was such a preacher oh my one
[1:47:34] day I'll talk about it but then we we
[1:47:37] find out that bam when he
[1:47:40] failed at his
[1:47:43] strategy he tried to cast
[1:47:46] Israel but when he failed he advised he
[1:47:50] advised balac
[1:47:53] he said I have an advice for
[1:47:55] you don't tell me again to cast these
[1:47:59] people because the
[1:48:02] uncastable aren you so glad you are
[1:48:06] uncastable we are the spiritual
[1:48:09] is hello bride we are the spiritual
[1:48:14] isra this makes me want to
[1:48:16] shout I am
[1:48:20] uncastable Glory Glory Glory
[1:48:24] am I am unable I am the of Israel but
[1:48:29] listen the devil has another
[1:48:34] strategy
[1:48:36] adise bam adise
[1:48:39] B there is another way you can weaken
[1:48:43] these
[1:48:44] people you may not cast them but you can
[1:48:48] weaken them and then you will overcome
[1:48:51] them he said which way he said send the
[1:48:56] girls send them
[1:48:59] girls from among the
[1:49:01] midianites and the moabites let them go
[1:49:05] and tempt their
[1:49:10] boys that was the doctrine of
[1:49:13] [Music]
[1:49:14] balam and and
[1:49:17] so prepared very good Jezebels
[1:49:24] with everything to attract the young
[1:49:27] people that are sincerely
[1:49:31] Jewish sin
[1:49:33] Israelites and you find that they were
[1:49:35] all going to the
[1:49:37] temple to bow down and to worship and
[1:49:41] they went to the
[1:49:43] parties of bow that is how it
[1:49:47] begins when a brother is
[1:49:50] backsliding that is how it begins
[1:49:53] you begin
[1:49:54] compromising the devil send someone to
[1:49:58] you to take you to a
[1:50:00] party is just a party it is at a home no
[1:50:05] problem but that party there is no
[1:50:09] single
[1:50:10] believer that party there is no one
[1:50:13] music of
[1:50:14] Believers one song of believer brother
[1:50:17] sister you are
[1:50:19] lost the devil is on easy way to consume
[1:50:22] you
[1:50:23] and they would go and they found
[1:50:26] themselves
[1:50:27] dancing worshiping dancing to the tune
[1:50:30] of the
[1:50:31] world I believe Believers should never
[1:50:34] be found in such
[1:50:37] parties whether it is a family party or
[1:50:41] a family gathering me in my family they
[1:50:43] know
[1:50:44] me they know me they have their beer
[1:50:48] they have their music they will never
[1:50:50] invite me because they know I can't
[1:50:55] come because if I go I will confuse them
[1:51:00] I dilize them I will tell them wait let
[1:51:03] us share the
[1:51:05] word and when I share the word they will
[1:51:09] go in their beers and me
[1:51:11] disappear so they don't have time for me
[1:51:13] to go and confuse
[1:51:15] them how can you be a
[1:51:18] believer and you say it is family thing
[1:51:21] and you sit Amen in a beer
[1:51:24] party they are playing worldly
[1:51:27] music and you are playing along you even
[1:51:30] find you're compromising on your
[1:51:33] dressing because you want to look like
[1:51:36] them it is a doctrine
[1:51:39] of it is there to make you back
[1:51:43] slide and that's why even on our
[1:51:46] weddings on our weddings we should
[1:51:49] always set the standard
[1:51:53] amen try your best in every area of your
[1:51:57] W to find a Believer who can who can
[1:52:00] work for
[1:52:02] you find a brother who will work as a
[1:52:06] DJ find a sister or brother who will do

[1:52:33] different and we should be
[1:52:36] ready Amen to Showcase what
[1:52:38] we we should be ready to show them this
[1:52:43] is what we stand
[1:52:45] for this is what we
[1:52:47] believe amen we are not of the
[1:52:50] world who told you we should be a
[1:52:55] praise God actually the Bible says
[1:52:58] anyone who will not reject mother father

[1:53:06] of you are the kind that your mother

[1:53:11] brother will always say you are the
[1:53:14] best you will even be the one to select
[1:53:18] the music for
[1:53:19] them and all the music you are selecting
[1:53:23] is what you know they
[1:53:26] like how did you even know
[1:53:29] them because
[1:53:30] you you are a make believer you not a
[1:53:34] serious believer oh where are young
[1:53:37] people where are old the people that are
[1:53:40] going to

[1:53:45] here I
[1:53:46] stand this is what I believe I am not
[1:53:50] going to compromise
[1:53:52] by the way Believers have been like that
[1:53:54] from time
[1:53:59] imoral they said we are not going to eat
[1:54:02] these pigs and these things you have
[1:54:05] squeez
[1:54:07] squeezed we are not we are going to eat
[1:54:12] greens we are not eating food from the
[1:54:14] king
[1:54:16] T why because they knew the King was not
[1:54:20] following the Jewish principles
[1:54:23] of making
[1:54:25] meat we will not
[1:54:28] bow we are believers who have going to
[1:54:31] have the same
[1:54:32] Zeal the same
[1:54:34] fire amen even though I walk
[1:54:37] alone I will walk in this way how many
[1:54:41] will say like that even though I walk
[1:54:43] alone in all my family I will walk in
[1:54:47] this straight
[1:54:49] way the Bible says narrow is the way St
[1:54:54] is the way that leads to to to the
[1:54:57] kingdom of God
[1:54:58] right it is narrow it is St it's not
[1:55:03] easy it is not an easy Road
[1:55:06] friends we have to take a
[1:55:08] stand I remember growing up I would be
[1:55:12] asked by
[1:55:13] friends but what games do you like and I
[1:55:17] remember all the games I used to
[1:55:20] like when I believe this message
[1:55:24] it all
[1:55:25] changed is that a
[1:55:27] Doctrine I did not say it's a doct all I
[1:55:31] said I'm giving you my
[1:55:33] testimony I lost the
[1:55:37] appetite I used to play
[1:55:39] Duru I lost the appetite I used to play
[1:55:43] cards I lost the appetite I used to play
[1:55:47] rud I lost the
[1:55:50] appetite if your is not lost
[1:55:54] I don't know about you but maybe if you
[1:55:56] find what I
[1:55:59] found make get
[1:56:02] lost I lost the for the football
[1:56:05] games for those filthy
[1:56:08] movies I lost the
[1:56:10] appetite I have a new
[1:56:15] appetite Hallelujah being a Believer is
[1:56:18] not a
[1:56:20] joke is having a backbone to stand
[1:56:22] regardless of the
[1:56:25] criticism accepted to be called an
[1:56:28] A and even then
[1:56:32] standing so he says abstain from
[1:56:36] fornication the whole world will say it
[1:56:38] has no
[1:56:39] problem but what does God say we find
[1:56:43] out here when this balam came and you
[1:56:47] know you know brought you know they
[1:56:50] brought the king brought all his girls
[1:56:54] they were cut
[1:56:55] off you find the brothers already in
[1:56:58] those Dan in the
[1:57:01] worships you know a
[1:57:04] brother in a
[1:57:07] disco no it is it has no problem it is
[1:57:10] at a
[1:57:12] school these days they have it they call
[1:57:14] it what
[1:57:19] somebody that's the doct of bam
[1:57:23] I
[1:57:24] believe a young person who is a Believer
[1:57:29] Christian should not be part of
[1:57:32] pro that is worldly the the world has
[1:57:36] not parted us we have no part in
[1:57:41] them and we should shine those things
[1:57:44] stay away from it we should amen have
[1:57:47] our way
[1:57:50] clear and we find that This Is How They
[1:57:53] started started you know playing those
[1:57:56] dances and things and before you knew it
[1:57:59] they were sleeping with those
[1:58:03] girls and there was this one of the
[1:58:06] boys he went you know the brothers and
[1:58:09] sisters were
[1:58:11] praying they were crying out in the
[1:58:14] congregation and Moses was there they
[1:58:17] were weeping the do of the Tabernacle of
[1:58:19] the congregation
[1:58:23] and he says and and this this median
[1:58:26] itish
[1:58:27] woman that one of the boys brought
[1:58:31] her and and and and took her out into
[1:58:34] one of the hearts or one of the
[1:58:37] rooms before the the
[1:58:39] congregation and there was a brother who
[1:58:41] was in the
[1:58:43] congregation he saw this scene
[1:58:46] happening he did not keep
[1:58:49] quiet let me tell you brother if you a
[1:58:52] brother or a sister living in
[1:58:56] fornication and you keep quiet you two
[1:58:59] you're going to be
[1:59:02] aable you will be a part of their
[1:59:06] sin we have to
[1:59:08] hold the standard of this
[1:59:11] message who will hold the standard of
[1:59:13] the
[1:59:13] message you will hold the standard of
[1:59:15] the message each of us have the
[1:59:19] responsibility but there was one
[1:59:22] called fin the son of elz the son of Aon
[1:59:27] the priest this was one amen of a kind
[1:59:31] he was from the priesthood he was a
[1:59:34] young man amen he arose from among the
[1:59:38] congregation he did not call everybody
[1:59:41] he did not call everybody he had gone
[1:59:44] with a Zeal with a Zeal of the word of
[1:59:48] God with a Zeal of the god of Israel
[1:59:52] and he took a Javin in his
[1:59:55] hands and he went as this these two were
[1:59:58] sleeping in a
[1:59:59] bed and he got that ja and pierced it
[2:00:05] through both of
[2:00:06] them and they
[2:00:09] di now when they are dead the plague was
[2:00:15] departed because remember God had
[2:00:19] instructed
[2:00:20] Moses amen to to kill them kill
[2:00:25] everybody they were all supposed to die
[2:00:28] and they were cutting off the
[2:00:30] heads let me tell you God doesn't joke
[2:00:33] with
[2:00:35] sin God wants
[2:00:37] Holiness God wants
[2:00:39] righteousness who told you Grace is a
[2:00:42] license for
[2:00:46] sin is not a license to
[2:00:48] say grace amen makes our heart to
[2:00:54] Grace brings the Holiness of God in our
[2:00:58] hearts Grace separates us from
[2:01:02] sin but some preach as if to say we can
[2:01:06] live and and live with sin and
[2:01:12] sinners preach good things don't talk
[2:01:14] about those
[2:01:16] things
[2:01:19] no it is in the scriptures
[2:01:22] and we are supposed to talk
[2:01:24] about where are the fines of
[2:01:27] today that will take a
[2:01:29] javing amen and kill every sin in
[2:01:36] the and you find fornication in
[2:01:40] marriage in Matthew 199 199
[2:01:44] says and I you whoever shall put away
[2:01:47] his
[2:01:48] wife except it be for for fornication
[2:01:52] and shall marry another commit adult
[2:01:56] andever Mar her which is put
[2:01:59] away Comm doubt and in the message
[2:02:03] questions and
[2:02:04] answers
[2:02:06] 59 say so
[2:02:09] fornication what is fornication
[2:02:11] fornication is what a girl when she
[2:02:14] lives unclean that's fornication
[2:02:21] because she has no
[2:02:23] husband but when she's
[2:02:26] married and then she lives like that she
[2:02:30] commits adultery against her
[2:02:33] husband a woman came not long
[2:02:36] ago and she said oh I've confessed all
[2:02:41] that she was
[2:02:43] nervous and had a
[2:02:45] breakdown and said I've confessed all
[2:02:48] that to
[2:02:50] God I said
[2:02:52] you have to confess it to your
[2:02:56] husband it wasn't God that you committed
[2:02:59] adultery
[2:02:59] [Applause]
[2:03:01] against it was your
[2:03:04] husband and if a man marries a
[2:03:07] woman and she lived unclean
[2:03:12] before she marries
[2:03:16] him and then she comes to
[2:03:18] [Music]
[2:03:19] him if they've been married so
[2:03:24] long and then she come to him and says
[2:03:27] honey I want to tell you
[2:03:29] something I did run out with another
[2:03:33] man I Never Told You Jesus said he has a
[2:03:37] right to put her
[2:03:41] away and marry another because they are
[2:03:44] not married in the
[2:03:47] beginning because she falsely told a lie
[2:03:50] against him
[2:03:53] very very serious very very serious
[2:03:56] fornication God doesn't like
[2:03:58] it he even brings it here as a room for
[2:04:05] divorce that is why you young girls
[2:04:08] younger boys don't flee from from
[2:04:11] fornication flee fornication because if
[2:04:14] you don't it will follow you all your
[2:04:18] life and especially you who do it after
[2:04:21] knowing the
[2:04:23] truth come into the knowledge of this
[2:04:26] message come into the grace of God come
[2:04:29] into the light of the world let me tell
[2:04:32] you when you go and live that kind of
[2:04:35] Life only God can lift you
[2:04:38] out it becomes very difficult you can
[2:04:41] never be the same even after
[2:04:46] repentance you will struggle all your
[2:04:48] life it will be a scar on you
[2:04:53] you want to live
[2:04:54] straight if you did those things out
[2:04:57] there
[2:04:58] before and now you are here in the Lord
[2:05:01] free from
[2:05:04] it it is not how close you can be to it
[2:05:07] and
[2:05:10] overcome it is how far you can be from
[2:05:14] me that is how you can
[2:05:16] flee and you find fornication in the
[2:05:19] church young people committing
[2:05:22] fornication 1 Corinthians
[2:05:26] 5:9 I wrote unto you in an epis not to
[2:05:29] company with
[2:05:32] fornicators yet not all together with
[2:05:34] the fornicators of of this world or with
[2:05:36] the cious or the extortioners or with
[2:05:38] idolators for then must ye needs go out
[2:05:41] of the world
[2:05:53] but now I have Reas unto you not to keep
[2:05:55] Company If any man that is called a
[2:06:00] brother be a fornicator orous or an
[2:06:04] idolator or a or a drunker or an
[2:06:07] extortioner with such one know not to
[2:06:12] it verse 11
[2:06:23] [Music]
[2:06:35] you find someone is a
[2:06:40] ra no a raer is someone
[2:06:44] who you know complains or Pro or
[2:06:46] protests strongly and persistently about
[2:06:49] something
[2:06:54] yes and also you find other brothers are
[2:06:58] extortioners no extortioners are people
[2:07:00] who practice obtaining things especially
[2:07:03] money through force or
[2:07:09] threats yes yes that's the correct
[2:07:13] interpretation you know the extortion
[2:07:15] money from people and things from
[2:07:18] people that is not a good brother
[2:07:22] you find a brother drinking alcohol is a
[2:07:26] drunker you find ad aous
[2:07:30] man or a
[2:07:32] fornicator the Bible says I'm not
[2:07:34] telling you not because it says don't
[2:07:36] company with these
[2:07:40] people but he saying I'm not saying all
[2:07:43] the people in the
[2:07:46] world because in the world everybody is
[2:07:48] doing these
[2:07:50] things saying if a man be called a
[2:07:55] brother if a man be called a sister a
[2:07:58] brother one of
[2:08:00] us but you find them out there
[2:08:04] Meandering
[2:08:05] around going with girls you know
[2:08:09] deceiving this one deceiving that one
[2:08:11] sleeping the other one sleeping the
[2:08:12] other one you know you find is a drunker
[2:08:15] here is extorting money from
[2:08:18] people what is it he says this one don't
[2:08:23] company yourself with
[2:08:25] them don't even eat with
[2:08:31] them now in questions and
[2:08:33] answers
[2:08:35] 1961 brother B says that's the reason I
[2:08:38] am anindependent
[2:08:42] I do not belong to the
[2:08:44] organization because I do not believe in
[2:08:49] organizations and I believe it's
[2:08:51] scriptural for an
[2:08:57] organization therefore I could not
[2:08:59] belong to any
[2:09:02] organization and feel justified by doing
[2:09:07] it therefore I do not take people
[2:09:11] in and make them
[2:09:14] members and so forth like that because I
[2:09:17] believe we are bound to be members we
[2:09:19] are Bond into the Church of the Living
[2:09:21] God
[2:09:25] says we don't take people's names off of
[2:09:28] the book and excommunicate
[2:09:33] them and everything like that because I
[2:09:37] believe that is not our duty to do
[2:09:42] that no man can take you on the book no
[2:09:45] man can remove you on the
[2:09:49] book only God can
[2:09:52] but follow along I believe it is God
[2:09:55] does the
[2:09:58] excommunicating hallelujah hallelujah
[2:10:01] but I believe that the church if there
[2:10:04] would be a brother that was doing
[2:10:06] something
[2:10:08] wrong and then he says for instance if
[2:10:11] they brother
[2:10:15] Neville brother
[2:10:16] Junior Martin brother brother one of the
[2:10:22] trust or something
[2:10:24] another doing something
[2:10:27] wrong I believe the thing to do is for
[2:10:29] the church to get together and pray for
[2:10:32] this
[2:10:39] brother I believe some of you are
[2:10:41] waiting for something like
[2:10:44] this they try to get together and
[2:10:46] excommunicate the
[2:10:49] brother no we have the attitude of
[2:10:53] Christ the church should get together
[2:10:56] and pray for a brother who is in the
[2:10:58] [Applause]
[2:11:01] room I believe the thing to do is for
[2:11:03] the church to get together and pray for
[2:11:05] this
[2:11:07] brother if you still don't get
[2:11:09] straightened
[2:11:11] up then let a couple go with
[2:11:14] him go to the brother to be
[2:11:18] reconciled and if then if they if he
[2:11:21] doesn't receive
[2:11:23] it then tell it before the
[2:11:26] church then if they don't receive it
[2:11:30] then that is the time for the whole
[2:11:32] church
[2:11:34] then see that's for pastor elders and
[2:11:37] everything else to do
[2:11:40] it I don't believe that any Deacon board
[2:11:42] has a right to throw anybody out of the
[2:11:50] church a right to do
[2:11:52] it I think if anybody was to be this
[2:11:58] Fellowship would be because of immoral
[2:12:04] living amen or something like
[2:12:08] that that he wasn't a fit person he
[2:12:12] wasn't a fit
[2:12:15] person like a man coming in
[2:12:19] here defiling our girl
[2:12:22] or insulting our
[2:12:24] women and things like that and still
[2:12:28] professing to be one of us
[2:12:30] here now if he isn't out somewhere else
[2:12:33] coming in why we have to do something
[2:12:36] about
[2:12:41] it but when it comes to a person like
[2:12:46] that an immoral
[2:12:49] person trying to make love to our
[2:12:53] wives or to insult our
[2:12:56] daughters or you know something another
[2:12:59] like
[2:13:00] that or do something immorally around
[2:13:05] her or taking our little boys out and
[2:13:08] making PS out of
[2:13:11] them or something those things should be
[2:13:15] taken
[2:13:16] up and then that fellow should be ex
[2:13:22] communicated from the
[2:13:24] fellowship and not permitted to take
[2:13:27] communion with
[2:13:29] him because we are not supposed to do
[2:13:32] that we are
[2:13:34] not praise the name of the Lord now you
[2:13:37] ask me why because he's still a brother
[2:13:42] he's claiming to be a brother but he's
[2:13:44] not putting himself
[2:13:49] right excommunication
[2:13:52] is for someone that is
[2:13:55] rebellious having lived
[2:14:00] immorally he's living
[2:14:03] immorally and remaining in
[2:14:05] his and in the
[2:14:09] church we should try to help him try to
[2:14:12] pray for him try to go to him another
[2:14:15] person to them and it's not changing
[2:14:18] then the cas should be brought to the
[2:14:19] church
[2:14:21] and he should be
[2:14:24] excommunicated that's how serious
[2:14:25] fornication
[2:14:29] is forication can kick you out of the
[2:14:33] church fornication can kick you out of a
[2:14:36] marriage forication can kick you out of
[2:14:38] the kingdom of
[2:14:40] God flee
[2:14:45] fornication and there are two things
[2:14:46] that you can do to avoid
[2:14:49] it the first one is to walk in the
[2:14:52] spirit Galatians
[2:14:55] 5:16 then I said then walk in the
[2:14:58] spirit and he shall not fulfill the lust
[2:15:00] of the
[2:15:03] flesh The Works of the flesh are
[2:15:06] manifest adultery fornication
[2:15:11] uncleanness idolatry witchcraft hatred
[2:15:16] Varan emulations wrath Strife TS
[2:15:20] heresies
[2:15:22] ining MDS drunkenness revilings and such
[2:15:26] like of which I've told you before as
[2:15:30] I've also told you in the time
[2:15:32] pass that they which do such
[2:15:34] things shall not inherit the kingdom of
[2:15:40] God if you walk in the
[2:15:43] spirit you will not
[2:15:45] fulfill the last of the
[2:15:48] flesh meaning the last of the flesh
[2:15:50] never
[2:15:52] goes it's always there because the flesh
[2:15:55] is
[2:15:56] can the flesh doesn't get filled with
[2:15:58] the
[2:15:59] ghost but how can you
[2:16:02] overcome walk in the
[2:16:05] spirit if you walk in the spirit you are
[2:16:08] not going to fulfill the desire of the
[2:16:11] flesh because you're going to live above
[2:16:13] the
[2:16:15] flesh you are going to colonize the
[2:16:18] flesh you are going to control the flesh
[2:16:22] amen why because you are walking in the
[2:16:26] spirit how do you work in the spirit by
[2:16:29] being in prayer how do you work in the
[2:16:31] spirit by reading the word by coming to
[2:16:34] church how do you work in the spirit
[2:16:37] amen by being
[2:16:39] filled with the Holy Ghost if you're not
[2:16:42] filled with the Holy Spirit it will be
[2:16:44] difficult for you to walk in the
[2:16:48] spirit praise God praise God and the
[2:16:53] last the last the last example here or
[2:16:57] rather
[2:17:00] solution to avoid
[2:17:02] fornication is
[2:17:06] marriage he says 1 Corinthians
[2:17:09] 71 now concerning the things whereof you
[2:17:11] wrot unto
[2:17:12] me it is good for a man not to touch a
[2:17:17] woman nevertheless to avoid fornication
[2:17:21] let every man have his own
[2:17:22] wife and let every woman have her own
[2:17:27] husband 7 to9 for I would I would that
[2:17:29] all men were even as myself but every
[2:17:32] man has his own proper gift of God one
[2:17:36] after this manner and another after
[2:17:39] that verse
[2:17:41] seven I said there now this is verse 8
[2:17:44] to the unmarried and widows it is good
[2:17:46] for them if they abide even as I but if
[2:17:49] they cannot contain pain let them marry
[2:17:52] it is better to marry than to burn
[2:18:27] so now if you do not walk in the
[2:18:30] spirit even when you
[2:18:34] marry you will still be
[2:18:37] defeated because you are
[2:18:39] can in your heart you need to walk in
[2:18:42] the
[2:18:43] spirit and then later on you need to
[2:18:48] marry
[2:18:49] single you may be a
[2:18:53] widow you may be um you know
[2:18:57] unmarried but if you cannot
[2:19:01] contain it says
[2:19:05] marry
[2:19:07] fornication God hates
[2:19:09] it it's a it's a spirit that is
[2:19:12] stripping all all
[2:19:14] over young people they in
[2:19:18] church but living in fornication but
[2:19:21] they don't even
[2:19:22] understand the implication of this
[2:19:27] thing there is a big implication upon
[2:19:29] their
[2:19:30] [Music]
[2:19:32] life and if I were you I would flee from
[2:19:36] it this is the time to put yourself in
[2:19:40] prayer to seek after God to be filled
[2:19:43] with the Holy Ghost and to Ser God
[2:19:45] there's really a lot to do for the
[2:19:47] [Music]
[2:19:48] Lord God bless you son
[2:19:53] [Applause]
[2:19:57] next maybe I'll talk about I'll talk to
[2:19:59] you on uh on on the doctr of
[2:20:05] bam and show you how that Spirit can
[2:20:08] creep
