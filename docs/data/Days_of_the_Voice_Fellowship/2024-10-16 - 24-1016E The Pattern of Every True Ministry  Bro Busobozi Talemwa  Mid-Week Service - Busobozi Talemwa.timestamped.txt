[30:16] every one of
[30:17] them and we ask oh God that if there is

[30:31] tonight because you are the Father the

[31:29] we ask your blessings now as we are
[31:30] reading your
[31:32] word in the name of Jesus
[31:35] Christ amen
[31:38] amen uh I'd like to greet you all in the
[31:41] name of our Lord Jesus
[31:44] Christ um and good
[31:49] evening is it a good a good
[31:53] evening amen shall we turn to our Bibles
[31:59] um we are reading out of second
[32:07] Peter chapter
[32:13] one we are reading only one verse and
[32:16] then we shall be
[32:21] seated
[32:23] amen
[32:26] amen we are reading ver
[32:32] 10 wherefor the rather Brethren give
[32:35] diligence to make your calling and
[32:37] election sure for if you do these things
[32:40] ye shall never fall
[32:46] [Music]
[33:01] [Music]
[33:02] amen you may be
[33:05] seated may the Lord bless us all tonight
[33:07] in his
[33:10] word
[33:12] amen uh we are so delighted once again
[33:14] to be in the presence of
[33:19] God being in his
[33:22] presence is more than being in the
[33:24] presence uh of the of the king or the
[33:27] president
[33:32] how many believe
[33:33] that and so I would like you to uh not
[33:37] only be here
[33:41] physically but I would like you to also
[33:43] be here your spirit soul and
[33:48] mind and um that way then the meeting
[33:52] and will be a blessing to us
[33:57] about what a preacher has organized to
[33:59] talk
[34:03] about it is also not about your
[34:08] coming but it is about his
[34:12] coming so when he
[34:14] comes then we are
[34:16] edified but you see he cannot come
[34:19] unless we are ready and willing to open
[34:21] up our hearts and receive
[34:22] [Music]
[34:25] him and the ministers also you know
[34:28] yield them so for God to use
[34:31] them that is how it happens and then it
[34:34] is a good
[34:37] service so our men are ready to open
[34:39] their hearts for speak
[34:43] them um I've preached on this subject
[34:45] here
[34:47] before yes um I'm not sure if it is
[34:51] years but I know many months
[34:54] ago but I've been speaking to a lot of
[34:57] young
[35:00] [Music]
[35:01] ministers and they kept on asking me
[35:03] things on this line and I thought maybe
[35:05] I should do the subject
[35:10] again the pattern of every true
[35:16] Ministry the
[35:18] pattern of every true
[35:25] Ministry it's all right if you have a
[35:28] better word you'll find it in the
[35:29] process but I think that is good enough
[35:31] so um
[35:33] we uh the scripture also says that um
[35:37] whosoever that shall call upon the name
[35:39] of the Lord shall be
[35:44] saved can you imagine whoever will call
[35:46] upon the name of the
[35:48] Lord but then he says how shall They
[35:52] Call On
[35:53] Him whom they have not
[35:56] believed and how shall they believe on
[36:01] him without a
[36:04] preacher and how shall the preacher
[36:09] preach except he be
[36:12] sent you understand so it's a
[36:17] sequence God sends a
[36:21] preacher you know and this preacher goes
[36:24] with a message from God
[36:27] and that message goes to edify the
[36:31] people the people believe the
[36:34] message and the people call on the name
[36:36] of the
[36:38] Lord and then they are
[36:40] saved um there is um last night I think
[36:45] it was last
[36:46] night I don't usually do that but uh
[36:50] somehow I was led to just click on on
[36:53] the summon that um uh pastor Ste
[37:05] preached and cuz I think I was attracted
[37:09] by the
[37:11] title and it was titled the body
[37:16] speaks and I listened to it and it was a
[37:21] masterpiece from the beginning to the
[37:24] end and I posted it on our church for
[37:27] him WhatsApp for
[37:30] him some people are very when they see
[37:32] two three
[37:33] [Music]
[37:35] hours but once again I had to say it
[37:38] here because I want to encourage
[37:40] everybody to go and listen
[37:43] to there's a lot of things that were
[37:45] said in
[37:47] there about the
[37:49] ministry about the the the gifts how God
[37:53] uses the
[37:55] gifts about how God speaks and uses
[37:58] people and about how people respond to
[38:01] that word and how they react towards the
[38:04] word and it was really so so good please
[38:08] go and listen to it and if you notice
[38:11] I've been talking so much about the
[38:15] soul um in the I just I was looking on
[38:19] the titles sometimes you know you give
[38:20] the titles subconsciously rather
[38:25] unconsciously so I first I was speaking
[38:28] on the bishop of our
[38:31] souls and then I spoke on concern for
[38:33] lost
[38:35] souls and then on Sunday Gathering
[38:40] Souls not building a
[38:43] denomination so it kind of feels that uh
[38:47] uh I noticed that there was a trend
[38:51] there that the holy spirit is trying to
[38:54] speak to us about the value of a soul
[39:01] and how to win
[39:03] souls so this evening because we have
[39:06] found out that you cannot win a soul
[39:08] unless you are
[39:11] sin so then how can we know a true
[39:14] Ministry how can you know that you are
[39:18] sent how can you know that what you are
[39:21] doing God is in
[39:24] it yes much of the Courts I'm going to
[39:27] read and the Scriptures it might seem
[39:29] that I'm only speaking on the preaching
[39:36] Ministry this applies to every single
[39:42] Ministry it might be the music
[39:45] Ministry and you are playing a certain
[39:48] instrument how can you be sure it is the
[39:51] will of God for you to play that
[39:55] instrument and also you might be singing
[39:59] you might be a special singer you might
[40:01] be a song leader you might be a deacon
[40:05] you might be a mother you might be a
[40:08] father you might be a preacher an
[40:11] evangelist a
[40:13] pastor or an apostle or whatever it is
[40:17] now some things if God has called you to
[40:19] know it is obvious you understand it you
[40:21] believe
[40:25] it but some other you you know gifts are
[40:28] even not so believable even for those
[40:31] that God has called them to fulfill
[40:38] them you know you will find someone and
[40:40] ask them
[40:42] what even for preachers like what is
[40:45] your what is your
[40:49] ministry and they don't know they're not
[40:51] too
[40:52] sure because but you see they believe
[40:54] they're
[40:55] called and because maybe they are also
[40:58] not some of them there I've seen a few
[41:00] Brothers I'm not too sure if I'm called
[41:02] into the
[41:06] ministry and then also some sometimes
[41:08] you attend in a church or in a service
[41:13] somewhere and you want to understand
[41:16] what is it a true
[41:18] Ministry is is it a true church for me
[41:21] to be a member
[41:23] of how can I know the kind of ministry
[41:26] to sit under
[41:29] so all those things is what we intend to
[41:31] answer in this uh sharing
[41:35] tonight now we started with this
[41:38] scripture which says give diligence to
[41:40] make your calling and election
[41:46] sure later on we will find out that the
[41:49] calling of God is without
[41:53] repentance if there is a gift upon your
[41:56] life or the calling of God upon your
[41:57] life he does you don't have to be a
[41:59] Christian first for you to realize you
[42:01] have
[42:08] it it is you born with it you called
[42:11] into
[42:13] it but you see in second Timothy 4:5 he
[42:16] says but watch thou in all
[42:21] things endure
[42:24] afflictions do the work of an evangelist
[42:29] make full proof of your
[42:32] ministry so Paul was speaking to Timothy
[42:35] to prove his
[42:38] ministry now before I even continue I
[42:41] want to say
[42:42] this no man can call another into
[42:48] Ministry no man can give another a
[42:52] gift only God can give you that gift
[42:57] and only God can call you into the
[43:01] ministry but you see what man
[43:04] does God can actually use another man to
[43:07] help you mature into your
[43:12] ministry and he can use another man to
[43:15] Mentor
[43:17] you like God used Paul for
[43:21] Timothy and and you know they kept
[43:24] that's the pattern that's the way God
[43:25] works
[43:28] you can't just come from
[43:30] nowhere you know wherever you are you
[43:32] know God will put you under
[43:35] somebody do you know that even David
[43:39] himself having been anointed by
[43:42] God and called by God to be a king of
[43:46] Israel God somehow brought him under I I
[43:50] might say the word tutorship of soul
[43:53] [Music]
[43:57] he put him under
[43:59] soul and he was there for a long
[44:01] time and in he served in different
[44:05] capacities at one time he served as um a
[44:09] flute or whatever player
[44:12] instrument you know and whenever he did
[44:14] it demons left
[44:17] so you know at another time he was a
[44:19] general was a
[44:21] soldier you know at another time you
[44:23] know he served in different capacities
[44:27] when you find a man like
[44:30] Samuel Samuel served under El
[44:34] or but you see each of these was called
[44:37] by
[44:38] God the same God who called
[44:41] Ellie also called
[44:44] Samuel and they were both anointed by
[44:46] the same
[44:48] God just like the calling of
[44:51] Jeremiah when God calls you into
[44:54] Ministry he doesn't call you because he
[44:56] has see now you are born and you look so
[45:00] nice and he says this one may be a very
[45:03] good
[45:04] Minister and then he calls you into
[45:06] Ministry no God doesn't just look at you
[45:09] and say this one can make a good wife
[45:12] when she gets
[45:16] married not everybody is a
[45:18] mother at least not everyone has had
[45:20] that chance to be a mother or the
[45:24] opportunity but you see we are called
[45:26] into the
[45:28] Ministries when before the foundation of
[45:31] the
[45:32] world we are manifested here on
[45:35] Earth to show forth the glory of God
[45:38] through our
[45:40] lives you know and you know jermiah when
[45:43] he he he he rose up in the ranks and you
[45:46] know God called
[45:49] him he was still a little young of
[45:51] course and he said I am young and how
[45:55] can I go out and speak
[45:58] I am afraid of them and how they will
[46:00] not listen to me but when when God came
[46:03] down to speak to
[46:04] Jeremiah he said before you were in your
[46:07] mother's
[46:08] womb I called you I knew you I
[46:12] Sanctified you I anointed you do you
[46:15] understand what I'm talking about
[46:17] whatever you were meant to be whatever
[46:19] Ministry God wanted you to be
[46:23] in God already sanctioned you before you
[46:26] were even in your your mother's
[46:30] wom he only sets you under some people
[46:33] or some man or some woman or whatever it
[46:39] is to be able to mold your
[46:42] character that is why me I don't believe
[46:45] that these ministers who say I am the
[46:47] one who made him who who he
[46:51] is there is no Minister who can make you
[46:54] who you are
[46:57] Minister who can make me who I
[46:58] am it is only God who made me who I
[47:02] am it's only God who made you who you
[47:05] are but you see he uses a
[47:08] man in your life to mold your
[47:12] character praise the name of the Lord so
[47:14] that you can be able to step into your
[47:16] God called or God ordained
[47:24] Ministry and that is why humility is
[47:28] ke if you are not
[47:30] humble you
[47:32] cannot you cannot be able to walk into
[47:36] that
[47:38] Ministry to the extent that the Bible
[47:41] says if you are ordaining a minister or
[47:46] deacons he says it should not be someone
[47:48] it should not be a
[47:50] novice a
[47:54] noice it should not be young in the
[47:57] faith yes because if he's a
[48:00] novice you know the Bible says he will
[48:03] be puffed up with
[48:06] pride because you see he has not his
[48:09] character is not yet
[48:13] molded if you find that all great
[48:17] men a humble
[48:20] men all great people are humble
[48:24] people when you see someone trying to
[48:26] show or trying to fight to show that is
[48:29] somebody or
[48:32] something that just shows he's still you
[48:35] know young in whatever he's
[48:36] [Music]
[48:38] doing it shows he's still a
[48:43] nervous praise the name of the
[48:46] Lord okay I just did not prepare to read
[48:49] this I have a lot of scriptures to read
[48:50] but let us also read this in 1 Timothy
[48:52] chter 3
[49:05] you know the word of God is so amazing
[49:11] friends vers
[49:16] six okay we can begin
[49:18] from
[49:20] um from verse one this is a truth saying
[49:23] if a man desire the office of a bishop
[49:24] he desires a good work a bishop then
[49:26] must must be blameless a husband of one
[49:28] wife Vigilant sober of good behavior
[49:30] given to hospitality able to teach not
[49:32] given to Wine no strier not greedy of f
[49:35] laer but patient not a Brer not cous one
[49:39] that ruleth well his own house having
[49:41] his children in subjection with all
[49:42] gravity for if a man know know not how
[49:45] to rule his own house how shall he take
[49:47] care of the Church of God not a noice
[49:50] lest being lifted up with pride he fall
[49:52] into the condemnation of the
[49:55] devil for
[50:50] you see the the Bible says not a
[50:54] noice not greedy
[50:58] filthy
[50:59] ler not
[51:02] cous one that knows how to rule his
[51:05] house and having his children under
[51:10] subjection having good
[51:12] behavior
[51:15] so a man a husband of one
[51:18] wife
[51:21] blameless
[51:23] patient not AER
[51:26] you see all these things are giving us a
[51:30] picture of how a bishop should
[51:35] be how a pastor should be how a preacher
[51:39] and Elder should
[51:41] be not someone you know you've done
[51:44] something and then automatically you
[51:45] know he wants to fight
[51:47] you you know because you know you've Hur
[51:50] him or done
[51:51] something you know you should be humble
[51:54] you should be uh calm
[51:57] but also he says you should not be a
[52:01] novice you see does God use
[52:05] novices yes but at a certain
[52:09] degree you see when God called
[52:13] David David stayed under that
[52:17] anointing before even he was
[52:20] anointed David was child trained by
[52:24] God in the bush
[52:26] [Music]
[52:27] and during that time you know a lion
[52:30] came to eat the
[52:32] sheep and you know he he got it and he
[52:35] killed it a bear came to eat the Sheep
[52:40] killed you see you might say well David
[52:43] was not someone asked me the question
[52:45] this
[52:46] evening why is it when
[52:48] Jess was asked by the prophet to bring
[52:51] out his children
[52:57] he did not bring
[52:59] David he brought all the other Sons but
[53:01] not
[53:03] David he left out David because David
[53:07] was the most unlikely candidate to be a
[53:11] king if God will ever make you anything
[53:16] big you will have to start
[53:20] small if if God will ever make anything
[53:23] big
[53:26] will have to start
[53:28] small small and
[53:31] despised Hallelujah never
[53:35] C amen what you see that others
[53:40] have their story is not your
[53:44] story my story is
[53:48] different my story is my
[53:51] story and what God is making out of
[53:54] me only God knows
[53:57] there it calls for me to be
[53:59] humble and grow through the
[54:05] process amen David was out there in the
[54:08] bush trying to raise the
[54:12] animals if someone came and told you
[54:14] that this young boy is going to be a
[54:18] king you couldn't believe it but God was
[54:21] molding
[54:24] character by the things that he suff out
[54:28] there and you know patience and
[54:31] resilience and
[54:33] longsuffering you know and and you know
[54:37] he was the character was molded in
[54:43] him and then time came for the
[54:47] anointing that was another now
[54:50] level and you see when the prophet came
[54:53] and told
[54:55] Jess one of your sons is going to be a
[54:58] king bring all of them
[55:01] here and Jess was did not even try even
[55:05] try to call
[55:08] David because David was unlikely to
[55:10] become a
[55:13] king did not know how to shave his
[55:16] hair even he he was smelling
[55:19] sheep he was just from the bush
[55:22] there and and you know he was you know
[55:25] rugged a rugged
[55:28] man but you see in him where the gifts
[55:32] of
[55:33] God him was the calling of God but it
[55:38] was just
[55:40] do waiting for
[55:43] manifestation Hallelujah when the time
[55:46] of God has
[55:48] come and when the time arrived for the
[55:50] anointing he wasn't even
[55:53] called it doesn't matter how man sees
[55:56] you
[55:58] it doesn't matter how man sees
[56:00] me it doesn't matter how they see our
[56:03] little
[56:05] church do you understand what I'm trying
[56:07] to say greatness comes from Small
[56:13] Things praise the name of the
[56:16] Lord you see we have a proverb in
[56:22] luganda that the things which become so
[56:25] booming the end of it all can come down
[56:28] you know whatever you want to H happen
[56:31] so
[56:32] fast will go so fast but if God is
[56:36] working in you a
[56:38] work you have to accept to go step by
[56:42] step grow one level from one level to
[56:47] another when all others are giving big
[56:51] testimonies don't be
[56:53] intimidated don't be intimidated because
[56:57] God is molding a great work in
[56:59] you and we see David AR at that
[57:03] time you know and they didn't even call
[57:06] him it doesn't matter whether they did
[57:08] not call to the
[57:11] table God
[57:12] himself by a Divine
[57:15] decree amen will bring you to the
[57:18] table it is not man to lift you
[57:22] brother it is not man or woman
[57:24] organization to lift
[57:28] it is God to lift
[57:30] you it is God to establish you it is God
[57:34] to call you to anoint
[57:36] you because he's the one who gifted you
[57:39] and anointed
[57:42] you and so we notice you know the
[57:45] prophet tried every one of
[57:48] them but God said
[57:51] no and until he went to the to ask Jesse
[57:57] don't you have
[57:59] another he said well I have a little
[58:03] another little one but he's a
[58:06] Bushman he's just a small small he said
[58:10] as long as is your child
[58:12] bring hallelujah hallelujah am I don't
[58:16] it doesn't matter how you are looked
[58:19] up but as long as you are amen a son a
[58:22] daughter of your father
[58:26] that blood is flowing through your
[58:29] veins Hallelujah there is something
[58:32] great in store for
[58:35] you every child of God is great because
[58:40] God is
[58:42] great Hallelujah and he was brought up
[58:47] and they anointed him now you would
[58:49] think after they anointed
[58:52] him immediately he will become a
[58:56] no God was still molding more
[59:01] character and you know they said you
[59:03] know they anointed him as a
[59:05] king but he was not yet a
[59:08] king you may not be a king
[59:12] yet but if you anointed as a
[59:15] king I say you are potentially a
[59:19] king and the Bible says you are Kings
[59:23] and
[59:25] Priests so I want to say this
[59:27] evening we are Kings
[59:30] also hallelujah amen your meal may be
[59:34] beans every
[59:37] day your meal may be
[59:40] potatoes and
[59:42] mushroom and
[59:45] vegetables why because you have no
[59:48] money in your pocket you may not have
[59:50] money right
[59:53] now hallelujah amen oh my enjoyed that
[59:56] sermon of brother
[59:59] Pastor he said you see New Testament Pro
[1:00:04] preacher is a
[1:00:07] prophet so right now I am prophesying to
[1:00:11] you I enjoyed that so much and I and I I
[1:00:16] identified with
[1:00:17] that because many times when preaching
[1:00:20] is going
[1:00:21] on literally it is the same anointing of
[1:00:24] a prophet
[1:00:28] because God gives you the
[1:00:29] knowledge to not and design the people's
[1:00:34] hearts until the preacher will preach
[1:00:36] exactly about
[1:00:38] you you be like what someone tell him no
[1:00:43] it is a prophetic utterance towards your
[1:00:48] life praise the name of the Lord praise
[1:00:51] the name of the Lord hallelujah amen and
[1:00:54] so we see the life of
[1:00:57] David is a very good example for our
[1:00:59] ministry
[1:01:01] today and they anointed
[1:01:04] him to become a king you would think he
[1:01:07] would jump
[1:01:09] up he said I'm a king from
[1:01:12] today give me a p give me a p let me go
[1:01:15] and cut
[1:01:18] soul and remove him from
[1:01:20] my but he had
[1:01:24] patience he had patience
[1:01:27] he knew I am going to take that throne
[1:01:32] and I'm going to take that
[1:01:34] throne and the Bible says we are Kings
[1:01:36] and we
[1:01:37] are so right now your pockets may be
[1:01:41] empty am I preaching to
[1:01:44] someone am I prophesying to someone
[1:01:47] right now you may have nothing on your
[1:01:49] bank
[1:01:51] account and people may be laughing at
[1:01:54] you right now now you may not even have
[1:01:57] enough tution
[1:01:59] money you may not have anything to your
[1:02:02] name but if God said you are a
[1:02:06] king it is going to come to
[1:02:09] pass it is going to come to
[1:02:12] pass it may not happen
[1:02:15] immediately because God is preparing
[1:02:19] you for the throne you are about to
[1:02:23] assure Hallelujah and a person who has
[1:02:27] faith in
[1:02:28] God will not see his pocket right
[1:02:32] now but will see the anointing upon his
[1:02:37] head David could feel it I don't see the
[1:02:42] throne I don't see the Throne of a
[1:02:48] king but there is something I can see I
[1:02:51] see the
[1:02:53] anointing I see the word because the
[1:02:56] anointing is the same as the
[1:02:58] word and therefore in knew I am a king
[1:03:03] he behaved as a
[1:03:05] king he he was
[1:03:08] Brave even when it came to that
[1:03:11] giant he did not fear because he knew he
[1:03:16] is a
[1:03:18] king hallelujah amen some of you you
[1:03:22] need to start seeing the the the the the
[1:03:25] the the the things that God is taking
[1:03:27] you
[1:03:30] to that are given to you by the word of
[1:03:34] Prophecy Hallelujah am praise the name
[1:03:37] of the Lord you must begin to see your
[1:03:41] ministry you must begin to see your
[1:03:43] family you must begin to see your your
[1:03:46] job you must begin to see your business
[1:03:49] you must begin to see these
[1:03:51] things you see your multi million dollar
[1:03:54] Corporation
[1:03:58] I'm speaking for he that has seen
[1:04:01] it that knows is Anointed for it you
[1:04:05] must begin to see your
[1:04:07] children some of you are mothers you
[1:04:10] know God has anointed you to be a
[1:04:12] mother but no one has even said they're
[1:04:15] interested in you to marry
[1:04:17] you let me tell you we don't walk by
[1:04:22] sight we walk by faith
[1:04:26] I am one person who works by
[1:04:29] faith I usually plan things I have no
[1:04:32] idea on how I will accomplish
[1:04:35] it but I tell you what my brother my
[1:04:39] sister whatever God has ever told
[1:04:42] me will happen and I
[1:04:44] plan and I announce
[1:04:47] it I plan I announce I work towards
[1:04:53] it money comes in the
[1:04:57] process that is
[1:04:59] faith that is vision and it comes when
[1:05:03] you have an anointing upon your
[1:05:07] life hallelujah amen he has anointed my
[1:05:11] head with
[1:05:14] oil my cup run
[1:05:16] over you have to understand children of
[1:05:20] God are not like the rest in the
[1:05:23] world don't cry because you are no
[1:05:27] money don't cry because you are seeing
[1:05:29] no house no husband no
[1:05:33] wife no don't get
[1:05:37] depressed don't give up if you want a
[1:05:41] car just let God anoint you for
[1:05:44] it whatever you desire when the moment
[1:05:48] is right no one can stop
[1:05:52] it Hallelujah and David was anointed
[1:05:56] as a king but it took him more than 15
[1:06:01] years for him to sit in that
[1:06:04] throne and he never killed soul to
[1:06:07] become a
[1:06:09] king some people have
[1:06:13] envy and
[1:06:15] greed when you know God has showed you
[1:06:20] something God told me I buy a car now
[1:06:23] this one has bought a car like the one I
[1:06:26] wanted I must bring them
[1:06:29] down I must bring them down because they
[1:06:32] taking my my
[1:06:33] place no one can take your blessing no
[1:06:37] one can take your place when God has
[1:06:40] called you into the work of
[1:06:43] ministry or any part of
[1:06:46] ministry no one can take your
[1:06:50] place you don't have to bring anybody
[1:06:53] down for you to go up
[1:06:57] brother bring up
[1:06:59] everybody lift up your brothers lift up
[1:07:02] your

[1:07:13] they
[1:07:15] have God will give you
[1:07:19] access to what they
[1:07:22] have David HED soul
[1:07:26] even when sa wanted to kill
[1:07:28] David but David still HED
[1:07:33] him he honed him but D but sa wanted to
[1:07:37] kill
[1:07:38] him but each time Saul tried to kill
[1:07:41] David David honed him he did not know
[1:07:46] every time every time David honored
[1:07:50] him the anointing upon it sa was coming
[1:07:53] upon David
[1:07:56] the anointing of the
[1:07:58] throne until God gave David
[1:08:03] favor even the son of Soul
[1:08:06] himself went on David's
[1:08:09] side Jonathan and he told him listen my
[1:08:14] father plans to kill
[1:08:16] you run for your life David did not want
[1:08:20] to
[1:08:20] run because he still wanted to
[1:08:23] serve do you know what I'm talking about
[1:08:27] if God will make you
[1:08:29] great you will serve regardless of what
[1:08:32] others are trying to do against
[1:08:36] you I don't serve because of man I don't
[1:08:40] Ser because of
[1:08:41] horor I serve because I have an
[1:08:44] anointing upon my
[1:08:47] life David
[1:08:49] served because of the
[1:08:54] anointing and
[1:08:56] God took
[1:08:58] Saul in
[1:09:00] battle and and and David took the throne
[1:09:07] gracefully can I prophesy to you
[1:09:10] tonight you sit on your throne
[1:09:14] gracefully Hallelujah am you will sit on
[1:09:17] your
[1:09:18] throne I said he will sit on your
[1:09:21] Thro no hell shall abound part of
[1:09:27] Darkness why because you are
[1:09:31] anointed for the
[1:09:33] ministry the ministry of a mother the
[1:09:37] ministry of a musician the ministry of a
[1:09:39] song leader the ministry of a deacon the
[1:09:42] ministry of a Preacher whatever God has
[1:09:45] called you to
[1:09:48] do even if it is serving
[1:09:50] man the B said do it as unto the Lord
[1:09:55] you have a job you serve
[1:09:58] God it's a
[1:10:01] Ministry make full proof of th
[1:10:05] Ministry
[1:10:07] Hallelujah if we knew these
[1:10:10] things we will not fight against other
[1:10:13] people who are doing things similar to
[1:10:18] ours I don't care how many people are
[1:10:20] doing things which look like what
[1:10:23] I'm they have their place in the economy
[1:10:28] of and if I honor
[1:10:31] them I lose
[1:10:34] nothing but I benefit
[1:10:38] everything Romans
[1:10:41] 124 for as we have many members in one
[1:10:43] body and all members have not the same
[1:10:45] office so we being many are one body in
[1:10:48] Christ and every one member of another
[1:10:52] having then gifts deferring according to
[1:10:54] the grace that is given to us where the
[1:10:57] prophecy let us prophesy according to
[1:10:59] the proportion of Faith or Ministry let
[1:11:01] us wait on our ministering oh he that
[1:11:04] teacheth on teaching or he that exalteth
[1:11:06] on exaltation he that giveth let him do
[1:11:09] it with Simplicity he that ruleth with
[1:11:12] diligence he that showeth Mercy with
[1:11:24] cheerfulness fore
[1:11:29] [Music]
[1:12:02] [Music]
[1:12:05] so you see the says we have members in
[1:12:07] one
[1:12:09] body all members had don't have the same
[1:12:13] office I'm a member of the
[1:12:16] body you are a member of the
[1:12:19] body none of us is greater than the
[1:12:22] other but each of us is important
[1:12:27] so we being
[1:12:29] many are one body in
[1:12:32] Christ and everyone members of one
[1:12:37] another you see sometimes when people
[1:12:40] hear a great
[1:12:42] testimony something that God did in some
[1:12:45] other person's Life
[1:12:49] Ministry they can't talk about
[1:12:52] it but when it is in their life
[1:12:56] they will talk about it
[1:12:58] everywhere you don't
[1:13:01] understand if the leg has one
[1:13:04] Victory the hand has won
[1:13:07] Victory if a testimony has happened in
[1:13:10] another
[1:13:11] church that believes this
[1:13:14] truth it is still my
[1:13:18] testimony if God has used another
[1:13:22] preacher in someone's life
[1:13:26] to do a great
[1:13:27] miracle to cause some good things to
[1:13:30] happen I can talk about it as as if I'm
[1:13:33] talking about my own
[1:13:36] Ministry because we are the same
[1:13:41] body but different members of the
[1:13:44] body and he says we have gifts def
[1:13:48] finding according to the
[1:13:53] grace according to the
[1:13:56] Grace that God has given to
[1:13:59] us where the prophecy let us prophesy
[1:14:03] according to the proportion of
[1:14:06] faith our ministry let us wait on our
[1:14:11] ministry and that includes you know

[1:18:10] to having expanded
[1:18:14] that I want to show you in the message
[1:18:17] the Ephesian
[1:18:21] Church how God um showed us
[1:18:27] how to identify a true
[1:18:30] [Music]
[1:18:32] Ministry cuz we have many
[1:18:35] ministers doing the same thing but how
[1:18:38] can we know he that is true like God
[1:18:45] ordained uhhuh that's what I want us to
[1:18:47] go through
[1:18:48] now how can you know that what you're
[1:18:51] doing God is in
[1:18:53] it how can you know God is blessing your
[1:18:58] ministry threefold quality of a true
[1:19:01] [Music]
[1:19:09] Ministry
[1:19:12] quality okay now he says I'll just read
[1:19:15] for you it says Paul founded the church
[1:19:17] at
[1:19:19] Ephesus about the middle of the first
[1:19:23] century this en has to set the date of
[1:19:26] the beginning of the Ephesian Church age
[1:19:27] to about 53
[1:19:33] ad his manner of ministering set the
[1:19:37] pattern that all future Messengers were
[1:19:39] to
[1:19:46] Aspire and actually it says the pattern
[1:19:49] for every true minister of God
[1:19:58] the pattern that Paul was ministering
[1:20:02] in it helped brother bam actually to
[1:20:05] understand the other Church Messengers
[1:20:08] after
[1:20:14] Paul they had to follow the same
[1:20:18] pattern and also he says not only in the
[1:20:21] generations the ages
[1:20:24] also to every true
[1:20:29] Minister though he would not attain to
[1:20:31] such Heights in the prophetic realm as
[1:20:33] did
[1:20:39] Paul but they would actually have to be
[1:20:41] in that same
[1:20:44] pattern's Ministry had a three-fold
[1:20:46] quality and was as
[1:20:52] follows number one first of all Paul was
[1:20:56] absolutely true to the
[1:21:01] word tell your neighbor he was true to
[1:21:04] the
[1:21:05] word he never deviated from it no matter
[1:21:09] what the
[1:21:12] cost if you want to know whether what
[1:21:16] you're doing God is with
[1:21:18] you whether it's a true
[1:21:21] Ministry you will have to be true to the
[1:21:24] word
[1:21:26] you will not deviate from this
[1:21:30] word you will not have some practices
[1:21:32] that are
[1:21:36] antib to be antib is to be against
[1:21:41] Christ and to be against Christ is to be
[1:21:47] Antichrist actually by the way this is
[1:21:49] what sets us apart from all
[1:21:51] denominations
[1:21:55] because for us as Believers of this
[1:21:57] message we are pro
[1:22:01] Bible we
[1:22:04] word if something God never said
[1:22:07] it we don't believe it
[1:22:10] and but if God said it we believe it and
[1:22:15] that settles
[1:22:17] it that those are message
[1:22:20] Believers and every true
[1:22:23] Minister will be absolutely not somehow
[1:22:29] hey not somehow true to the
[1:22:34] word he will be
[1:22:37] absolutely true to the
[1:22:40] world don't follow someone because there
[1:22:42] is the miraculous in their
[1:22:46] Ministry that is not the only
[1:22:48] Vindication true of
[1:22:52] God don't follow someone because because
[1:22:54] they have a big
[1:22:57] church that is not the Vindication
[1:23:01] only what vindicates
[1:23:04] someone to be a true
[1:23:07] Minister he will be true to the
[1:23:11] word how he
[1:23:13] teaches what he teaches how he behaves
[1:23:17] he will be according to the
[1:23:23] word now he may be having a huge
[1:23:28] charge 10,000
[1:23:31] people and they all listening to
[1:23:34] him but if he accepts women
[1:23:39] preachers he believes in three Gods
[1:23:42] instead of
[1:23:44] one he's a false
[1:23:46] preacher simply
[1:23:48] put if he he rejects the Holy
[1:23:51] Spirit he refuses he he rejects tongues
[1:23:54] interation of and the manifestation of
[1:23:57] the Holy
[1:23:58] Ghost he's a false
[1:24:02] preacher you
[1:24:05] identify a preacher by him being true to
[1:24:09] the
[1:24:15] word he never deviated Paul never
[1:24:17] deviated from the word no
[1:24:20] matter he will be ready to die for the
[1:24:23] word
[1:24:27] by the way let me tell you a preacher
[1:24:30] who is not ready to die for what is
[1:24:32] stands
[1:24:35] for is not a
[1:24:37] [Music]
[1:24:39] preacher I am ready to die for this
[1:24:44] truth I am ready and I'm not trying to
[1:24:47] make you
[1:24:50] radical I'm telling you the truth the
[1:24:53] disciples all died for this
[1:24:56] truth I remember when I was in China to
[1:24:59] cature their preaching is a death
[1:25:03] sentence and I was preaching in an
[1:25:06] underground
[1:25:07] church somewhere on a floor high high
[1:25:10] high think it was about 15
[1:25:13] something and someone just came and
[1:25:19] knocked the Brethren said they have
[1:25:21] called
[1:25:22] us everybody in one in just about 3
[1:25:26] seconds they HIIT their
[1:25:29] Bibles it is only me who was left with
[1:25:32] M and I'm a
[1:25:36] foreigner everybody
[1:25:38] freezed I talked to my interor I said
[1:25:42] what is
[1:25:43] wrong he
[1:25:45] said if the are the law
[1:25:49] enforcers then they going to arrest
[1:25:51] you I said what happens usually
[1:25:55] said this
[1:25:59] sentence I
[1:26:01] sweated that's the
[1:26:04] truth but as I was wondering what I
[1:26:06] should
[1:26:07] do in that
[1:26:09] moment should I also hide my my
[1:26:12] Bible should I run can you run off in a
[1:26:16] 15 15 story
[1:26:22] building I was desperate
[1:26:26] and then a thought just came to
[1:26:27] me now I knew why the Believers accepted
[1:26:30] to die for this
[1:26:35] truth a thought came to me preach if the
[1:26:39] interpr refuses to
[1:26:40] interet continue preaching let them find
[1:26:44] find you and catch you
[1:26:47] preaching and at least you would have
[1:26:49] died for the
[1:26:51] truth so I told the brother can we
[1:26:54] Contin preaching he said yes we can he
[1:26:57] also became so ragged I love that
[1:26:59] brother and and someone went to
[1:27:01] open with were preaching and the g
[1:27:05] increased I was ready to
[1:27:08] die and then when he opened the door he
[1:27:13] opened went
[1:27:15] out and then came
[1:27:18] back the the brother was doing like this
[1:27:21] he said like this so we contined
[1:27:23] preaching time I thought someone is
[1:27:25] coming at the end of it all I was told
[1:27:29] that they found nobody
[1:27:31] outside they don't know what
[1:27:33] happened but brother that was a test of
[1:27:36] my
[1:27:38] faith what you believe if you can't be
[1:27:42] ready to die for
[1:27:44] it you don't believe it you're just
[1:27:48] kidding we must be ready to give our
[1:27:53] neck for this
[1:27:55] why because Jesus gave his
[1:28:00] name for
[1:28:02] us hallelujah hallelujah we must be true
[1:28:06] to the word we must never compromise the
[1:28:09] word
[1:28:12] regardless we don't want to be the kind
[1:28:14] of preacher that comes and says I
[1:28:18] apologize I no longer believe
[1:28:21] this I apologize
[1:28:24] I made mistakes here no wonder Paul said
[1:28:28] to Timothy
[1:28:30] study don't just preach stud
[1:28:34] fast even to you brothers who are going
[1:28:36] in homes of Believers
[1:28:39] preaching don't just go there to speak
[1:28:41] your
[1:28:46] mind eat the word eat the message don't
[1:28:50] talk about something until you are sure
[1:28:52] about it
[1:28:55] what does the Bible say what does the
[1:28:58] prophet say if you don't know you ask
[1:29:00] your
[1:29:02] pastor and if he doesn't know you will
[1:29:03] ask the
[1:29:05] prophet
[1:29:08] hallelujah hallelujah Paul said though
[1:29:10] we or an angel from heaven preach any
[1:29:12] other gospel unto you than which we have
[1:29:14] preached unto you let him be a cast
[1:29:24] said before so I said now again if any
[1:29:26] man preach any other gospel unto you
[1:29:27] than that ye have received let him be a
[1:29:34] cast Paul was true to the
[1:29:36] word he was saying even if an angel
[1:29:39] comes from
[1:29:40] Heaven he cannot remove this
[1:29:43] message he cannot change the
[1:29:46] word the word we are
[1:29:48] preaching is unchangeable
[1:29:54] unchangeable No Angel can change it no
[1:29:56] man can change
[1:29:58] it Galatians 2:1 says but when Peter was
[1:30:02] come to Antioch I with him to the face
[1:30:06] because he was to be
[1:30:12] blamed but when I saw that they walked
[1:30:14] not uprightly according to the truth of
[1:30:16] the
[1:30:21] Gospel I say to Peter before them
[1:30:25] all if thou being a
[1:30:29] Jew live in the manner of the
[1:30:33] Gentiles and not as the
[1:30:35] Jews why do you compare the Gentiles to
[1:30:37] live as the
[1:30:42] Jews you see the words of
[1:30:44] Paul he was true to the
[1:30:47] world he was a bold man he was not a
[1:30:54] ass somebody who
[1:30:56] cified having no strength and boldness
[1:31:00] to stand for the
[1:31:02] truth we must be able to stand for
[1:31:06] the I met this Pentecostal
[1:31:09] preacher he just stored my house
[1:31:12] yesterday and um an old
[1:31:15] friend and so I he told me these things
[1:31:19] I gave this magazine you gave me to some
[1:31:21] of my fellow Bishops
[1:31:26] and they know better than
[1:31:29] I he's a theologian you know so he said
[1:31:33] they would maybe want you to come and
[1:31:35] explain to them
[1:31:37] better many times they think these
[1:31:40] Bishops
[1:31:43] actually the higher Bishops usually do
[1:31:45] that to to to they send them say okay
[1:31:48] now tell them to come and meet us we
[1:31:49] shall we
[1:31:58] so I told
[1:32:00] him they think they are going to correct
[1:32:05] us this is what I'm thinking
[1:32:07] now but actually we are going to show
[1:32:10] them the
[1:32:11] truth to us it is an
[1:32:15] opportunity it is an
[1:32:17] opportunity so I said wow I am waiting
[1:32:20] I'm ready I'm available when you want us
[1:32:24] to go he was so shocked and I was so
[1:32:28] happy to
[1:32:30] go I then added my brother the words I'm
[1:32:34] speaking to
[1:32:36] you I did not learn them from a Bible
[1:32:39] colle the message we are preaching to
[1:32:42] you is not a theological
[1:32:45] message it is taugh by the Holy
[1:32:48] Ghost God sent a prophet with a message
[1:32:53] which is the direct to the
[1:32:55] Bible and he has confirmed it to
[1:32:59] us by the Holy
[1:33:02] Ghost this is the Holy Ghost
[1:33:06] message Hallelujah the end time
[1:33:10] message is not another
[1:33:12] idea it's not a somebody's
[1:33:15] Doctrine this is more than a church
[1:33:19] doctrine it is more than
[1:33:22] religion this is that say the
[1:33:26] Lord and when God confirms it to
[1:33:31] somebody's you are going to be on
[1:33:34] fire they will tell you we want to meet
[1:33:36] you we want you to meet our Arch
[1:33:39] Bishop take me take me I tell them take
[1:33:44] me one time someone sent
[1:33:46] me sent one someone sent me a
[1:33:50] picture you know in the in the don't
[1:33:53] remember which year but he preached on
[1:33:55] salmon and it are greater than Solomon
[1:33:58] is
[1:34:03] here and there's another salmon there he
[1:34:06] preached the queen of
[1:34:08] shba so now brother preached those
[1:34:11] sermons in the 60s I believe and so we
[1:34:15] know it we've read it we've heard
[1:34:17] it talks about the wisdom of Solomon and
[1:34:20] everything and then Christ
[1:34:22] and the queen of cand
[1:34:26] things and and the
[1:34:29] types so so Apostle
[1:34:34] Grace put up a sign
[1:34:37] post
[1:34:38] and if you ask me I'll send it you I'll
[1:34:41] look for
[1:34:42] it and it was having an invitation for
[1:34:46] the people like the the ones they
[1:34:50] met greater than Solomon is here
[1:34:55] and you know there was another title
[1:34:57] there the Queen of
[1:34:58] Sheba
[1:35:01] inv inviting the people to
[1:35:04] come that
[1:35:06] message his
[1:35:08] message I was so full of
[1:35:11] jealous I said these men they read the
[1:35:14] message that is a good thing but they
[1:35:18] are reading
[1:35:19] it with aeve
[1:35:24] they pick some things and they leave
[1:35:27] others and even what they have picked
[1:35:30] they claim it is their personal
[1:35:34] re they don't
[1:35:36] refer to where the source
[1:35:40] is because they
[1:35:43] afraid the people will leave
[1:35:46] them when they
[1:35:48] realize where the truth is the person
[1:35:52] who sent me that picture
[1:35:54] was a member of that
[1:35:56] church who believed the
[1:35:58] message when they had Apostle Grace
[1:36:01] talking about brother
[1:36:04] Bram and they went and
[1:36:06] searched who
[1:36:08] William and they saw the message and
[1:36:11] finally they were led to
[1:36:13] us we baptized them and that's how now
[1:36:18] they
[1:36:19] desired the message simply because of
[1:36:22] one a man mentioned they think they're
[1:36:24] mentioning the name and they end up
[1:36:26] saying he ended up being a false
[1:36:32] prophet but the seed can't be
[1:36:35] deceived when they get into it and they
[1:36:39] read for themselves and they hear for
[1:36:41] themselves they say this is the word now
[1:36:44] this is the truth this is the word so I
[1:36:47] was so full of
[1:36:49] jealous for the word I said let me go
[1:36:53] and face this
[1:36:55] man sometimes I can behave a bit
[1:36:59] unruly let me go I took the church age
[1:37:02] book I took the
[1:37:05] message I took the queen of she I said
[1:37:08] I'm going to him so I drove to his
[1:37:11] office not so far from here and uh
[1:37:15] unfortunately when I reached there I was
[1:37:17] thought oh he has gone for holiday but I
[1:37:20] was welcomed properly and you know given
[1:37:22] place and I said I'll come back I never
[1:37:26] failed to go
[1:37:28] back they know the truth but they
[1:37:31] rejected
[1:37:34] it they
[1:37:36] replaced they take the
[1:37:38] truth and apply their their Theology and
[1:37:43] apply other things regardless of how
[1:37:46] well they soft or well
[1:37:51] spoken it doesn't make them to
[1:37:55] preachers why because they are not true
[1:37:59] to the
[1:38:02] word where someone comes and explains to
[1:38:04] you that a woman can be a preacher that
[1:38:06] you know we are no longer in the Old
[1:38:13] Testament the Bible did not say that we
[1:38:17] preachers women should not preach
[1:38:18] because of the law
[1:38:23] this is something that came before the
[1:38:29] law you read in the Book of Genesis
[1:38:32] you and you'll also find it again in the
[1:38:34] book of First
[1:38:37] Timothy what was the reason the woman
[1:38:40] was having the opportunity and ability
[1:38:43] also to teach the
[1:38:47] word and she was a Bible
[1:38:50] teacher and she taught the word
[1:38:54] to The
[1:38:55] Serpent and word came out of
[1:38:57] it she added on the
[1:39:00] word and because of adding on the
[1:39:04] word the devil took
[1:39:06] away the woman said God said you should
[1:39:08] not eat or touch
[1:39:10] it God never said don't touch
[1:39:13] it God said don't eat it because she
[1:39:16] added that part the devil became excited
[1:39:20] he also
[1:39:22] said in that yes God knew you will
[1:39:25] become wise like
[1:39:28] him but don't worry you will not
[1:39:30] die that was an
[1:39:33] addition when the devil
[1:39:35] added the Eve's heart was
[1:39:39] worn she was
[1:39:43] deceived and in the book of second
[1:39:47] Timothy before we go to I mean before we
[1:39:49] go to First
[1:39:50] Timothy right there in Genesis when God
[1:39:54] came down he said now woman because of
[1:39:58] what you have
[1:39:59] done two things were added to
[1:40:02] her number one that you will be ruled
[1:40:07] over your desire shall be upon your
[1:40:11] husband he shall rule over
[1:40:14] you and you will you will have pain in
[1:40:17] child
[1:40:20] birth even the grace of Jesus
[1:40:24] and the death of Jesus on the
[1:40:27] cross does not take away
[1:40:31] that that's why even Believers women who
[1:40:34] are believers and filled with the Holy
[1:40:36] Ghost they have pain in
[1:40:42] child even sah who was a holy ghost fed
[1:40:45] woman she called her husband my Lord she
[1:40:47] knows he's ruling over me
[1:40:55] that did not
[1:40:57] change it is the word and the word of
[1:41:00] God cannot be
[1:41:04] changed you cannot do it and that's why
[1:41:07] in the New
[1:41:09] Testament When God Says women should not
[1:41:12] be allowed to teach author over
[1:41:19] man I want you to watch the reason he
[1:41:21] gave
[1:41:24] in the book of second rather 1 Timothy
[1:41:26] chter
[1:41:27] 2:
[1:41:29] 11 let the woman learn in Silence with
[1:41:31] all subjection but I suffer not a woman
[1:41:34] to teach nor to ass Ser authority over
[1:41:37] the man but to be in
[1:41:40] [Music]
[1:41:46] [Music]
[1:41:52] silence and he gives the reasons now for
[1:41:55] Adam was first formed than
[1:42:00] Eve second reason and Adam was not
[1:42:05] deceived but the woman being
[1:42:09] deceived was in the
[1:42:12] transgression so you see the Bible
[1:42:14] cannot contradict
[1:42:20] itself this is the new test this is the
[1:42:23] New
[1:42:24] Testament and it was not because of the
[1:42:28] law that a woman was stopped from
[1:42:31] [Music]
[1:42:33] preaching no it was not it was the word
[1:42:36] of
[1:42:37] God before the
[1:42:39] law and the word of God is forever
[1:42:41] settled where
[1:42:44] in is the same yesterday today and
[1:42:48] forever but our
[1:42:50] sisters who are saved
[1:42:55] the Bible says they shall be saved in
[1:43:02] childbearing if they continue in
[1:43:06] faith God has promised that they will
[1:43:08] not die or suffer or you know have all
[1:43:12] these complications in child
[1:43:18] birth but because they don't
[1:43:21] believe they don't continue many soal
[1:43:23] Christian
[1:43:25] women they don't continue in
[1:43:28] faith they go for this kind of you know
[1:43:31] modern civilized bath control
[1:43:36] stuff they have the
[1:43:39] complications but if they were to
[1:43:41] continue in
[1:43:43] faith to believe the God given
[1:43:47] way they will give birth like Hebrew
[1:43:50] women it is the promise of the world
[1:43:54] praise the name of the Lord and so you
[1:43:57] cannot make the word
[1:44:01] contradict of course women can teach
[1:44:04] older women can teach younger
[1:44:07] women and they can also preach to Sunday
[1:44:10] school
[1:44:13] children that because the Bible allows
[1:44:15] them to teach
[1:44:17] children and I always say if a sister
[1:44:20] feels she has a calling upon her life we
[1:44:22] want her to come and a
[1:44:27] preacher to the Sunday
[1:44:30] School just like you teach your children
[1:44:32] at
[1:44:33] home and and you younger sisters if the
[1:44:36] older sisters come to teach you don't
[1:44:38] begin becoming
[1:44:43] proud the Bible says they are teachers
[1:44:45] of
[1:44:48] good they teach you how to love your
[1:44:51] husbands they teach how to to love your
[1:44:54] children how to to be a home
[1:44:58] maker this is in the book of Titus
[1:45:00] Chapter
[1:45:01] one which means you don't know you have
[1:45:03] to be
[1:45:05] taught and you older sisters that's your
[1:45:09] responsibility all these weddings we
[1:45:12] have since that's not a pastor's
[1:45:16] job you you older
[1:45:18] sisters it is your job to go to this new
[1:45:24] and You Begin teaching
[1:45:26] them how to love their
[1:45:29] husbands how to be
[1:45:31] hakers how to love their
[1:45:34] children how to do all these
[1:45:37] things what the Bible
[1:45:39] says praise the name of the
[1:45:41] Lord can we read
[1:45:44] it praise the name of the
[1:45:47] Lord uhuh chapter two of
[1:45:50] Titus it says aged women verse three
[1:45:54] likewise that they be in Behavior as
[1:45:57] becometh Holiness not false accusers not
[1:45:59] given to much wine teachers of good
[1:46:12] [Music]
[1:46:18] things so you see they aged how are they
[1:46:21] aged I may not think that in age
[1:46:23] like in many years I would think aged in
[1:46:25] the
[1:46:32] Lord and also of course in
[1:46:35] age that they may teach the young women
[1:46:38] to be
[1:46:43] sober to love their
[1:46:46] husbands so you younger women you don't
[1:46:48] know how to love your
[1:46:50] husbands they should teach you
[1:46:59] yes the B says they should teach
[1:47:03] you okay they are not
[1:47:05] here God bless you Sister I know you
[1:47:10] watch sister

[1:47:18] accept they teach you how to love your
[1:47:22] you don't know
[1:47:25] you don't know it's not my words it's
[1:47:29] the words of the bible let them teach
[1:47:32] you how to be
[1:47:34] sober so which means you're not sober

[1:48:28] the motherly
[1:48:30] love talking about the
[1:48:33] care because you do not know how to do
[1:48:36] it you find because the mother has

[1:52:20] Blas praise the name of the Lord so you
[1:52:24] see we believe in women

[1:52:34] to teach
[1:52:38] men that is not
[1:52:40] allowed in all churches of the
[1:52:43] Saints if a church is allowing
[1:52:46] it that is not a church or a Ministry
[1:52:49] that is true to the word
