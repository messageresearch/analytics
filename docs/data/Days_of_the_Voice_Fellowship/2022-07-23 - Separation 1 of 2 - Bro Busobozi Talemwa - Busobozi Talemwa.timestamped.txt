[0:06] foreign
[0:26] we are reading from verse one
[0:33] and the lord spoke unto moses saying
[0:37] speak unto the children of israel and
[0:39] say unto them
[0:40] when adam
[0:44] and say unto them
[0:46] when either man or woman shall separate
[0:49] themselves to vow a vow
[0:51] of another right
[0:54] to separate themselves unto the lord
[0:57] he shall separate himself from wine
[1:00] and strong drink
[1:01] and shall drink no
[1:03] vinegar
[1:05] of wine
[1:06] or vinegar of strong drink
[1:08] neither shall he drink any liquor of
[1:10] grapes nor eat moist grapes
[1:14] or dried
[1:15] all the days of his separation
[1:18] shall he eat nothing that is made of
[1:20] vine tree
[1:21] from the colors even to the past
[1:25] all the days of the vow of his
[1:26] separation
[1:28] shall no razor come upon his head
[1:31] until the days be fulfilled in the which
[1:34] he separated himself unto the lord he
[1:38] shall be holy and shall let the locks of
[1:41] the hair of his head grow
[1:44] all the days that he separated himself
[1:47] unto the lord he shall come at no dead
[1:51] body
[1:52] he that shall make he shall not make
[1:56] himself unclean for his father or for
[1:59] his mother for his brother or for his
[2:02] sister when they die
[2:05] because the consecration of his god is
[2:08] upon his head
[2:11] that's up to verse 7
[2:20] israel
[3:47] amen
[3:48] mena loving jesus yes
[3:51] we have ourselves to you tonight don't
[3:54] become us
[3:56] we
[3:57] are not as holy as your word is the
[3:59] truth
[4:02] and that's why we have come here
[4:04] so that we might be made holy
[4:07] fully
[4:08] according to your wife
[4:10] we desire that as we hear your word
[4:12] tonight
[4:16] we will
[4:17] be taken out of the way
[4:20] that you will speak to us why are you
[4:22] getting our faith and that we shall open
[4:24] our spiritual ears
[4:26] together
[4:51] but i pray that you refresh us
[4:53] every judge we hear your
[5:24] ask the lord to speak to you what's
[5:25] happening you'll get a journey
[5:29] the bible says ask and you shall receive
[5:31] i believe
[5:33] now can be open foreign
[6:32] i
[6:39] 18 september 2013.
[6:46] only one
[6:58] and so i
[7:00] thought i should i just suffered
[7:02] inspired to speak on this subject again
[7:08] and uh
[7:10] i trust it will be a blessing to us
[7:14] amen
[7:16] god bless you my name is aggression come
[7:17] on come on i appreciate it that you
[7:19] don't miss any service
[7:21] [Music]
[7:24] i was working with one brother the other
[7:26] day
[7:27] chris has never missed any you know
[7:57] mind
[7:59] we all understand what separation is
[8:03] separation
[8:05] is something very
[8:06] very interesting
[8:10] uh separation is a a must
[8:15] take in life
[8:18] but today i want us to look at it in a
[8:19] spiritual perspective
[8:22] [Music]
[8:24] here in the book of numbers
[8:28] moses gives the laws concerning
[8:31] separation
[8:35] i should say that the lord spoke to
[8:37] moses and he gave him laws concerning
[8:39] separation
[8:44] and this was also connected to a vow of
[8:47] another right
[8:51] way and more awakening if a woman or a
[8:53] man wanted to be to vow a vow of being
[8:57] another right
[9:01] they had to separate themselves
[9:07] now we are no longer under the law of
[9:09] moses
[9:10] which are the ones who are taking a
[9:11] muslim but we are still under the law of
[9:13] god wobble up to the ones who are taken
[9:15] yeah and the law of god is the word of
[9:17] god
[9:20] and if god required then for people to
[9:23] separate themselves i believe he still
[9:24] requires people now to separate
[9:26] themselves
[9:33] if god wanted then for people to be
[9:36] nazarites i believe even today he does
[9:45] that was a man or a woman that was
[9:48] living a consecrated life in service to
[9:50] god
[9:52] [Music]
[9:57] and they did not do everything that
[9:59] everybody else did
[10:28] from the time he was in his mother's
[10:30] womb but he had
[11:06] but you see it has its blessings that
[11:08] follow it
[11:12] another rape is always a little uh
[11:14] favored from the lord
[11:16] or by the lord
[11:22] he goes ahead to describe how he will
[11:25] separate himself and from what
[11:30] he says he will not drink wine
[11:34] he will not drink any strong drinks
[11:37] i will not drink vinegar
[11:39] vinegar he will not
[12:02] [Music]
[12:06] both physically and also spiritual
[12:20] that's why we keep our hair a certain
[12:36] was not supposed to touch the head of
[12:38] another one
[12:42] and now today
[12:44] we notice in the new testament
[12:47] it should not touch your sister's head
[13:07] you should not look like a woman told
[13:09] enough
[13:11] to look like the rest of the world
[13:14] because you are another right unto the
[13:15] lord
[13:17] am i preaching to someone tonight
[13:20] and he says that all the days of that he
[13:22] separated himself unto the lord
[13:28] shall not come to any dead body
[13:32] and he shall not take make himself any
[13:34] clean for his father or for his mother
[13:40] or for his brother when they die obama
[13:44] it doesn't matter whether it is your
[13:45] mother or your father
[14:06] if anybody loves their mother or their
[14:08] father or their sister or their brother
[14:10] more than christ
[14:25] must not love your family members more
[14:27] than you love christ
[14:56] then even if everyone else is not happy
[14:59] as long as you have made your priorities
[15:02] right
[15:04] are you following me
[15:06] so those were the rules the laws uh
[15:09] concerning separation concerning uh
[15:12] being in nazareth
[15:17] now
[15:19] in the message it shall be even as it
[15:22] was told me
[15:37] is
[15:51] elijah sleep
[16:07] separation
[16:11] in his death god wasn't with him
[16:17] in the death of christ god was not he
[16:20] died alone
[16:25] he had to suffer the absence of god in
[16:28] his death that we could have the
[16:31] presence of god in our deaths
[17:02] oh
[17:25] so many sins go before them and some
[17:27] follow
[17:28] abby every single year so many sins they
[17:32] go before them
[17:36] but some other many sins follow them
[17:41] which one do you want
[17:43] to go very do you want your sins to go
[17:47] before you
[17:49] or you want your sins to follow you oh
[17:51] yes
[17:54] follow me
[17:56] if you do not know then follow me
[17:58] let's
[18:12] bro if we confess them now we're to be
[18:15] had to reckon it goes before us
[18:18] so but if you don't
[18:20] live this life
[18:22] your sins
[18:23] they follow you
[18:27] and christ made our judgment christian
[18:31] and god in the garden of eden when he
[18:33] pronounced strength upon the human race
[18:44] [Music]
[18:55] from one another prayer will occur
[18:58] now
[19:00] means separation
[19:02] doesn't mean to you know die is that
[19:05] death is not the end of something
[19:32] it means that someday you will be
[19:34] separated from me
[19:49] because of jesus christ's death on the
[19:51] cross
[19:53] christopher he was the bridge
[19:56] between them
[19:58] and light
[19:59] hallelujah amen he was
[20:01] dying on the cross
[20:03] what did he do
[20:04] here
[20:13] [Music]
[20:32] because jesus died our death
[20:35] yes we are from which he fought your
[20:36] faith so that we could live his life i
[20:39] want no faith to turn body damage away
[20:42] can you tell that to somebody back of
[20:43] god
[20:44] jesus died our death yes we have how
[20:46] much fortune feels that we could leave
[20:48] his life faithful

[20:53] so that i can live his life
[20:56] when i'm awake we die to the world to
[20:58] fight aliens so he could live his life
[21:13] says god forbid how shall we that are
[21:15] dead to sin leave any longer they reign
[21:23] christians must be dead
[21:27] christians must be separated
[21:56] jesus christ we are baptized into his
[21:59] death
[22:06] therefore we are part of him by baptism
[22:08] into death
[22:13] as christ was raised up from the dead by
[22:15] the glory of the father even so we also
[22:18] should walk in the newness of life
[22:20] christopher zucchinis
[22:23] were churched our way
[22:52] now we
[23:40] knowing that christ being
[23:42] raised from the dead dies no more

[43:31] your nose your your your hands i'm also
[43:33] going in your corners
[43:36] you may decide to use it through
[43:37] instruments as instruments of
[43:39] unrighteousness
[43:43] you can decide to yield your eyes to
[43:44] watching the other things of the world
[43:49] last four things if you're going to
[43:52] decide to yield yourself to those no

[44:05] are rotten again
[44:48] foreign
[44:50] do you really think the devil was more
[44:52] powerful than eve
[44:57] debate within yourself for a moment
[45:02] do you really think that the devil was
[45:04] more powerful
[45:08] really
[45:10] think about it you know
[45:13] if the devil was more powerful than he
[45:15] satan he was single
[45:17] he was more powerful than
[45:18] adam
[45:19] is an adam singer and if he was more
[45:22] powerful than adam
[45:23] singer it means he was more powerful
[45:25] than godzilla
[45:28] the devil could not have been more
[45:29] powerful than eve saturn
[45:59] [Music]
[46:29] [Music]
[46:39] you are listening to west life oh what
[46:41] it is
[46:44] people listening to
[46:48] all those things
[46:50] are listening oh what is that those
[46:52] songs really touch my heart is the new
[46:54] embassy
[47:04] [Music]
[47:08] yo
[47:11] and what does the bible say i believe
[47:13] neither you'll hear your members say why
[47:16] you'll be turned to be amazing
[47:18] instruments
[47:21] yes
[47:36] but the problem we have oh is it worthly
[47:38] now not very many people want to yield
[47:41] themselves unto god
[47:45] they're born again believers
[47:48] but they don't want to heal themselves
[47:52] why don't we have more and more gifts
[47:55] manifesting in the church
[47:58] [Music]
[47:59] why don't we have the book of acts the
[48:02] charge of the book of acts again in its
[48:04] power rajiv
[48:16] yielding their members unto god
[48:46] you already said come on what are you
[48:48] doing with your members
[48:51] because you don't spend time for my life
[48:54] yielding yourself unto god
[48:58] and you spend time healing yourself
[49:01] and to being righteous
[49:08] you see that's why even when you come to
[49:10] church it is very difficult sometimes
[49:12] even for the songwriter to start the
[49:13] service to allah
[49:42] atmosphere
[49:44] someone will stand up
[49:45] here sometimes you even someone runs
[49:48] after the preaching of the word i have a
[49:50] testimony
[49:53] of judaism and when you give them a
[49:54] microphone they want to preach
[50:06] they don't even attend fellowship on
[50:07] wednesday night september
[50:09] and what are they doing teach about
[50:10] their
[50:25] would happen one day of those things
[50:27] what they're hearing
[50:30] what you you do in your free time
[50:35] the moves
[51:20] i think some of us some of you need to
[51:22] do some cleaning
[51:27] cleansing
[51:31] on things that you have been yielding
[51:49] is more
[51:50] acceptable with comedy montreal
[51:54] young women excellent even in the church
[51:56] the name of canister they have wanted it
[51:58] to be commended
[52:02] for people
[52:27] have you ever been there you meet
[52:28] somebody whatever they count
[52:30] to them
[52:37] [Music]
[52:42] you know yielding his members to
[52:44] instruments
[52:58] there's a problem
[53:10] themselves
[53:54] will have no
[53:56] the minion over here
[54:00] why
[54:02] because we have a person
[54:04] who actually know we have a man
[54:07] who kept down on afghan
[54:26] [Music]
[54:51] that rules in death
[54:55] if you have a husband
[54:57] or a wife
[54:59] both of you are alive
[55:02] your husband rules over you bow
[55:29] revelation of jesus christ
[55:33] [Applause]

[56:06] amen
[56:08] say hallelujah
[56:10] he is alive
[56:11] but we are dead
[56:14] and when we die we're too far sin
[56:17] stopped ruling over there
[56:20] and now
[56:22] when we rose again
[56:27] and we have acquired another heart
[57:04] [Music]
[57:08] it has been raining on me the whole
[57:10] night

[1:01:54] what do you want to do for you
[1:01:59] stop doubting
[1:02:03] separate yourself from unbelief
[1:02:11] you see
[1:02:12] and and god wants you to have a total
[1:02:15] separation
[1:02:17] away i would eat it
[1:02:19] actually he has already done it it's
[1:02:21] just called that but he wants you to
[1:02:22] walk into it
[1:02:24] it's all right now listen
[1:02:26] in the message israel and the church
[1:02:30] now this may be very strong
[1:02:47] and i wanted to notice
[1:02:49] immediately
[1:02:52] after choice
[1:03:00] now
[1:03:01] it's separation from everything else
[1:03:06] as soon as he called
[1:03:12] he elects
[1:03:13] yeah
[1:03:14] he calls night then when he calls that's
[1:03:18] why
[1:03:19] he separates you from everything that
[1:03:21] hangs on to you
[1:03:24] but then he could be bigger
[1:03:28] how many can you say that he's still
[1:03:29] separating something
[1:03:35] that proves that it isn't a denomination
[1:03:39] it isn't two or three people together
[1:03:57] please
[1:03:58] pray for them
[1:04:00] and allow god to do that in their life
[1:04:02] okay
[1:04:05] it isn't because my mother there is
[1:04:07] saved
[1:04:21] [Music]
[1:04:24] how much you prayed for what's happening
[1:04:26] no no no no it's not how much you pray
[1:04:31] it's not then that when you try the new
[1:04:33] page
