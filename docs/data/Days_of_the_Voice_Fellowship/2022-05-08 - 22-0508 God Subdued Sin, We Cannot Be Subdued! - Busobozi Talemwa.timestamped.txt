[56:29] the government trying to disarm the
[56:31] people government
[56:34] these people are warriors
[56:38] they have guns by the name
[56:40] and they have had it for years
[56:42] so
[56:57] the only way they can be able to kill
[56:59] them is if they use the airplanes and
[57:02] dizzy big guns
[57:11] but if they use i think that will be oh
[57:14] for just a moment for you to see clearly
[57:16] and that if they used
[57:18] guns one on one
[57:38] has done something wonderful
[57:43] anywhere else in uganda
[57:48] we preach
[57:51] you know people received it in karamoja
[57:56] in such a very very big way
[58:00] people who were
[58:01] the warriors
[58:05] of this message
[58:07] and
[58:08] they have actually
[58:10] they are the ones it is because of the
[58:12] believers of this message
[58:18] now developing
[58:26] we were in one place which i will show
[58:28] you shortly one way forward to
[58:29] everything in the benchmark and
[58:31] you know the chairman is the pastor is a
[58:33] believer the chairman is a believer the
[58:34] chairman
[58:46] they don't usually have
[58:48] issues
[58:54] because it happens once in a blue moon
[58:59] that was the chairman chairman
[59:01] i tell you this message changes
[59:04] sad people not only on the it's not like
[59:06] the brother was saying it's not a
[59:07] religion like these others
[59:10] it is christ
[59:14] and so on day number one
[59:38] so that is pastor charles there with the
[59:40] his associate brother edison oh yum
[59:43] sumba charles namud
[59:53] day number two we started meetings in
[59:55] morocco
[59:59] and this is a short clip
[1:00:02] of the service in morocco
[1:00:06] those people can really jump
[1:00:48] [Music]
[1:00:54] but then
[1:00:57] the day number three
[1:01:00] we were in my time
[1:01:02] now moroto
[1:01:03] moroto is the
[1:01:05] was the first massive church there you
[1:01:07] can say over here
[1:01:18] he was not educated but he was one of
[1:01:19] the first people to receive this message
[1:01:20] in this country by the way in the early
[1:02:01] my mom
[1:02:10] [Music]
[1:02:20] [Applause]
[1:02:29] [Applause]
[1:02:36] i think we have issues with that but i
[1:02:37] think you will see that on uh
[1:02:46] no but i need the picture
[1:02:48] where's the picture
[1:02:49] it's not moving
[1:02:55] did you notice that
[1:03:02] okay it is still not moving
[1:03:06] okay so
[1:03:08] then we went to you know in matan we had
[1:03:11] about um
[1:03:14] about 300 people mama tell me where you
[1:03:16] are a little more
[1:03:17] to knock it but you see these were just
[1:03:19] a few who came never nobody but
[1:03:22] you're with us in the meetings there
[1:03:23] were many more that did not come up
[1:03:28] and
[1:03:29] then from there we went to up another
[1:03:31] place called iriri but when they took
[1:03:33] individual iridi now it really
[1:03:36] we had
[1:03:38] more than 500 people
[1:03:42] who came and sat on under a very huge
[1:03:46] tree
[1:03:50] and
[1:03:52] it was just beautiful i wish that this
[1:03:54] was working i don't know what's
[1:03:56] happening
[1:03:57] you know it was just beautiful looking
[1:03:58] so beautiful
[1:04:00] well you just go on youtube and see that
[1:04:02] later
[1:04:05] and also this is on the website the
[1:04:07] website jvd those of you who can access
[1:04:09] the internet
[1:04:11] organic internet so even this uh
[1:04:14] presentation is there you can be able to
[1:04:15] see it in a presentation
[1:04:19] there is a church in ireland that they
[1:04:21] are constructing worldwide some illegal
[1:04:24] immigrants
[1:04:26] they're almost finishing it by the way
[1:04:30] and the pastor told told us
[1:04:33] they needed about uh
[1:04:36] two point five million malibu targaryen
[1:04:54] so some people they gave some money from
[1:04:57] nebraska uh and yesterday i sent
[1:05:01] uh brother
[1:05:03] uh his name is uh i'm sorry i can't
[1:05:06] remember his name
[1:05:35] from ireland we went to contido we
[1:05:37] traveled a leading they took in the
[1:05:38] cottido contido brother this thing
[1:05:58] it was quite an amazing time
[1:06:01] but it was very hard to go there
[1:06:06] so it was quite uh difficult for us to
[1:06:09] get there challenge is even your gained
[1:06:11] are you because
[1:06:13] the road to cortido is very bad
[1:06:44] there
[1:06:47] but god saved us
[1:06:49] and we went through it gently
[1:06:52] um and
[1:06:54] now to come from contido again was
[1:06:56] another
[1:06:57] big hustle
[1:07:09] so one brother sent me a video
[1:07:12] after we
[1:07:19] and
[1:07:20] he sent me a video where water was just
[1:07:25] oh it had almost cleared all the roads
[1:07:30] now whenever it rains people die
[1:07:32] brilliant
[1:07:34] because they have to cross
[1:07:36] and they think they will cross the water
[1:07:37] and they want to justify that
[1:07:40] and so the brothers some of the brothers
[1:07:42] wanted me to drive through such a road
[1:07:47] the land is very flat in sierra you're
[1:07:50] not a flat you know so the roads are
[1:07:53] flat
[1:07:54] [Music]
[1:08:00] so we had to sleep in a place called uh
[1:08:04] uh where was that
[1:08:05] yes
[1:08:08] so we found a place there and we spent
[1:08:10] in a beam traffic
[1:08:12] and then in the morning
[1:08:14] we we traveled we started our journey to
[1:08:17] uh soros
[1:08:22] so i want to bring greetings to you
[1:08:26] from the believers
[1:08:29] in matan amatani in kotido kotido
[1:08:33] in abim we met the pastor there trusting
[1:08:36] in
[1:08:50] they all send their greetings
[1:08:53] amen i mean
[1:08:55] so we uh i preached almost like twice a
[1:08:59] day

[2:10:32] and what she's called foreign
[2:10:54] we
[2:11:23] now that you came up that we attempted
[2:11:26] to talk about
[2:11:27] including sexual temptation
[2:11:32] that jesus
[2:11:34] yes our god
[2:11:36] when he came in
[2:11:50] including
[2:12:04] b hmm was it
[2:12:07] charlie when the woman came oh my way
[2:12:10] yeah yeah and every man wanted to stone
[2:12:12] her um
[2:12:16] the man wanted to destroy her
[2:12:45] [Music]
[2:13:14] so
[2:13:21] but i'm reading the scripture
[2:13:23] and i'm reading between the lines
[2:13:25] you must have been tempted for a moment
[2:13:28] i said
[2:13:57] i'm just thinking out aloud but then
[2:13:59] could it have been that much
[2:14:01] when the woman came
[2:14:04] with buttons
[2:14:07] you know sometimes women can be so
[2:14:08] emotional
[2:14:52] so
[2:15:00] then jesus yes
[2:15:02] he now meets that woman nothing
[2:15:05] and the woman comes because they're
[2:16:02] the one who became seen hey
[2:16:06] the bible says he was touched i believe
[2:16:08] him by your coming what caught the
[2:16:09] feelings of our infection
[2:16:11] for faith all the
[2:16:13] temptation that we attempted and he came
[2:16:15] of your name
[2:16:29] [Applause]
[2:16:58] sin
[2:17:11] i love the amplified version
[2:17:17] hallelujah
[2:17:19] so he will not impute sin to us
[2:17:24] why
[2:17:25] not because we are better than others
[2:17:30] but because we have believed it
[2:17:35] the moment you accept christ as your
[2:17:37] savior
[2:17:40] and you believe in him no more
[2:17:42] baptized no baptism
[2:17:44] in his name
[2:17:46] not in trinity
[2:17:48] but in his name
[2:17:49] from that moment
[2:17:51] he does not impute sin unto you
[2:17:58] amen
[2:18:00] it is by receiving christ by faith in
[2:18:02] the world
[2:18:23] he says bible jesus
[2:18:24] for the law of the spirit of life
[2:18:31] and in brackets he says which is
[2:18:35] in christ jesus
[2:18:50] [Music]
[2:19:32] because you've grown up with it
[2:19:35] you know because it is according to your
[2:19:37] country

[2:20:25] it could not overcome sin cuban a taker
[2:20:46] and we were being weakened by the flesh
[2:20:49] catify
[2:20:50] between tuna for years
[2:20:53] that is man is nature without the holy
[2:20:56] spirit
