[1:17] time
[1:18] coming if there was a time for you young
[1:20] men to be serious with
[1:23] God it means to forsake everything
[1:27] else do it be on fire
[1:31] because to be on fire for God is a
[1:34] decision you
[1:35] make to be on fire for God a choice you
[1:39] take there is no power in Hell or in
[1:43] Heaven Can hinder you from doing that
[1:46] because the price has already been
[1:48] paid for whoever wants to
[1:52] drink can come and drink whoever wants
[1:55] the Holy Ghost come and drink I believe
[1:59] this is a
[2:01] if there was any shouting
[2:03] to is the time to
[2:05] shout was
[2:07] praying
[2:09] time because I tell you people who go to
[2:11] the wrong
[2:12] place they go praying they go
[2:18] sh when the door was
[2:20] shut those who were on the outside were
[2:23] praying shouting nashing the
[2:26] tee let me tell you because time was
[2:29] over
[2:30] but now is the time for us to
[2:33] pray and do whatever we need to do to
[2:36] get right with
[2:39] God because if we don't we may never
[2:41] have another
[2:45] opportunity praise the name of the
[2:47] Lord the message is all about the coming
[2:49] of the
[2:51] lord it's not our I
[2:54] understand it is by his
[2:56] grace but you see what his grace does
[3:01] his grace doesn't take you into
[3:05] disgrace his grace makes you to
[3:09] fear his grace brings you to a place of
[3:14] surrender his grace brings you the
[3:18] realization brings you
[3:20] Revelation brings you understanding amen
[3:24] brings you you know the Bible says there
[3:26] will be these people who are scers in
[3:28] the last
[3:31] we are going to have many people who
[3:32] ridicule us for what we stand
[3:34] for people are going to mock us for what
[3:38] we you know people who are going toer at
[3:42] us you know joke at with us and tease
[3:45] [Music]
[3:47] us at us but I'll tell you why they do
[3:51] that because they do not recognize the
[3:55] their day and the
[3:58] message for anyone who knowing what the
[4:01] Bible and the word of God
[4:05] says goes and does something
[4:10] willfully they actually trying to SC at
[4:13] the
[4:16] word and that's why the Bible actually
[4:19] says that having received the
[4:23] light having received the revelation of
[4:26] the word having received the mystery of
[4:29] the word
[4:30] and being rece
[4:32] enlightened and then you fall
[4:35] away you SC at
[4:38] it he said two things
[4:40] one he said that you are taking Jesus
[4:43] Christ again on the
[4:46] cross and he says you're putting him to
[4:48] open
[4:51] shame number two he says they shall
[4:54] never be
[4:55] forgiven meaning they they cannot be
[4:58] restored
[5:04] [Music]
[5:05] you can that
[5:06] [Music]
[5:08] scripture that's all right you can
[5:11] interpret it your way I justas it for
[5:15] you what does it show the Bible speaks
[5:18] about the
[5:20] scof those that will scof the
[5:23] word when you know what the word
[5:25] says but then you you laugh at it talk
[5:30] about it you teach others who believe
[5:33] it you ridicule
[5:37] [Applause]
[5:39] them listen
[5:41] carefully 1964 recognizing your day and
[5:44] its
[5:47] message and also the Simplicity of the
[5:50] message and the
[5:53] messenger Noah wasn't
[5:56] scientific he wasn't an educated man
[6:00] he was a poor
[6:01] farmer humble with a simple
[6:04] message it was too simple for their High
[6:09] Learning this message is too
[6:12] simple so it is so e it
[6:16] today God always makes it
[6:20] simple to get the people who will
[6:22] believe and trust
[6:25] him God is not looking for people who
[6:27] can reason
[6:30] God is looking for people who are
[6:33] simple and who will believe the world
[6:36] and who will trust God and take him at
[6:39] his
[6:40] word it's a different just a simple
[6:43] message a different message it
[6:46] says but the same
[6:49] God now I want you to believe it and
[6:53] understand that God has
[6:55] spoken Jesus said they sced at his
[6:58] prophet
[7:01] they SC that no
[7:02] he and as they sced in that
[7:05] day so will they do it again at his
[7:11] coming God has sent a prophet to
[7:14] us people have scoffed at him you go all
[7:18] over the Internet we have had preachers
[7:22] who have come and scoffed at
[7:25] William because of what he
[7:27] told ah M they could not find one
[7:32] thing in his
[7:34] life to Pi
[7:37] on they could not say committ
[7:41] doubt they could not say he he he begged
[7:44] for
[7:45] money or he stole money they could not
[7:48] say you know he preached you know he
[7:52] lived a wrong kind of
[7:54] Life they could not say that do you know
[7:58] why because
[8:00] the God that was in him enabled him to
[8:03] live the
[8:05] life even with all the
[8:09] possibili of him taking the
[8:13] money would have bu one of the biggest
[8:16] religious
[8:20] organizations the 19th
[8:23] century if he had taken the direction of
[8:26] many
[8:28] preachers

[8:35] him but he refused
[8:43] thees
