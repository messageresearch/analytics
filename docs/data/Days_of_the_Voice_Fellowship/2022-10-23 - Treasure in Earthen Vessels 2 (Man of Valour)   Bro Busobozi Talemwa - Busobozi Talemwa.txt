second Corinthians Chapter 4 verses 6 to 9. channel amen if you have a seat in front of you please take it don't be don't don't fear to be near the fire that's what we have to do foreign versus part two is what I'm talking about today is 2 Corinthians 4 6. for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ [Music] but we have this treasure in art and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed is foreign I would like to announce to you before I forget that uh next Sunday the Lord willing I'll be ministering at evening light right Tabernacle yeah spoke to past Pastor Brother Joseph and I get economics and he asked us to come and speak for them I've spoken to them before Zoom several times but I think we'll this will be our first time to visit them physically and so their services are usually early in the morning because they told me from nine to around 10 30. so that means I can finish with their pulpit and come back on my board amen I mean so I'll go with a few brothers that uh when I call your name please I have a reason for whoever I will check so when I call your name don't refuse it in Japanese I mean praise the name of the Lord and so then after that we also are preparing to receive uh Pastor Moses is also nailed in the country on the next month on the 13th son um if you write notes please write it down on the 13th we shall have Pastor Moses I'll give more details as the days praise the Lord spoke a wonderful full message to us and he actually came and he helped me because this was the some subject I had started on I don't even need to go deep anymore I only need to continue with his with inspiration I spoke on Treasure vessels the same scripture we are taking again but today we will go a little deeper into other scriptures for God has commanded the light to shine out of Darkness that same God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness and he said let there be light he has shined in our hearts we are trying to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ and then he says but we have this treasure in African vessels when I was beginning I asked you a question and said if you have your treasurement where would you rather keep it what the one this is something that is precious to you why would you rather keep it in a metallic uh uh something or in a picture come on now [Music] you put it in the metal hey and hide it away from prying eyes you know we have things we call safe we truly name into editorial treats and almost in every home or at least the middle income Anna's arms they have safes in the safe safe there is a lot of uh things that you you you you uh presume are precious to you and you keep it in a safe but you see God is so amazing but it's not like us who keep things in a safe who keep things foreign [Music] you even reach somewhere a sport where nobody's seeing you yeah foreign oh my goodness I mean and he says we have this treasurements and Pastor Stephen spoke to us and he said the gospel is the life and also the light is the word Christ wants to take that light like he said let there be light again the gospel is let there be light energy and you know sometimes when we are in church we want to feel and we want to be made we want to somebody to make us feel like as if we are perfect and holy oh man [Music] because you come to church many times foreign foreign we are foreign there was Delight the Bible says that the Earth was covered with Darkness but God simply spoke right yeah hallelujah amen he created light out of that yeah there's nothing that Darkness did it is not nothing that that foreign all right foreign and stuff [Music] thank you foreign foreign [Music] thank you today oh my God foreign [Music] [Music] um foreign foreign all right perfect Brothers foreign [Music] foreign sometimes foreign foreign and tell you what when Israel has shown that the media Knights came out at the annual height of the children of Israel sorry that the children of the East even they came up against them and they had come against them and destroyed the increase from God till now come and bless them and let the dogs foreign and Israel was already impoverished because of the leader and the children of Israel cried under the law each other [Music] um [Music] foreign [Music] Jesus foreign amazing what is humidity stop today um thank you says the Lord [Music] thank you one time what's up if he married a chorus you know like that right now that's called a powerful man of God but if he married a pain that face because the woman is the character of the man the woman is the manifestation of the character of the man or mukes that's why Jesus says he is not going to marry a prostitute yes he is not going to marry I am a woman again do you know the kind of woman Jesus is going to marry oh hallelujah amen he is going to marry a virtuous he's not even going to marry one who has Community fornication again foreign his word the woman shot the character of the nation again if you want to if you go into a new country and you want to know that spiritual status I remember when I landed in a when I came out of the aircraft it was fair because there were many Africans in there maybe Industries and people were pretty dressed up and covered so as I'm telling you the truth airport and I I stepped my first foot outside on the streets I almost covered my eyes because I was feeling that you know here in Africa we still have a lot of distance but many countries yeah you you host Brethren from from Europe or from America and they will see someone dressing a Scott or or address and they will ask you is that a Believer here we host Believers from Europe we want to teachers and when they see someone walking on the streets with a dress yeah but she's not even a believer but here we still have some distance that's why our presidents have refused some things not only in Uganda but also most African countries why why because we still have some businesses here we now see that when I reach there when natoka I almost covered my heart and for a while I was walking down my brother asked me bikini well maybe because it was hot yesterday foreign because you see honey and I was saying nothing that you will know the character or germanium Pizza of the church he is a canister by the women and I can as much I can talk about that but let me keep with the thoughts and so it was when Israel had sown you know the their sin so far away from God that is and because of that already God said let the medianized whatever they would saw the midianites would wait send a message yeah foreign they were good for nothing let us read seven to nine customers and it came to pass when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord because of the midianites that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel which said unto them thus say the Lord God of Israel I brought you out up from Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all that are pressed you and drove them out from before you and gave you their land and verse 10 and I said unto you I I am the Lord your God fear not the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice this prophecy was not new it was a prophecy that was already given in the past time in the past but I did not hear Bruno Mars but you see two things I want you to see here whenever the children of God cries to the Lord foreign [Applause] and he keeps speaking to us God is a living God we cannot say he sent prophet and he sent us a prophet full stop if God stopped working with brother William Branham no longer living but the Bible tells me Jesus Christ is the same yesterday [Music] thank you [Music] foreign I'd like you to put that on your lips and tell everybody maybe there's something so hard in your life brother God still does Miracles I don't care how hard it is do you believe in miracles yes I'm preaching to you today do you believe in miracles God still does Amen you believe God can change you from nothing to something you might feel like that's the pot of clay language I want to tell you today brother sister he's about to move a natural camera he's about to start working do you believe now hallelujah hallelujah we may be here at a small Church to collect land money for our land we don't know how many people you believe in miracles God can give us a brand new land cartoons hallelujah amen without even painting God is able to do that there is no white man is going to do it for us God will do a miracles in the same same way you will do miracles in your life chocolate hallelujah amen and I wanted to see the moment the prophet prophesies in judges 6 verse 11 now and he says and there came an angel of the Lord hallelujah do you believe in angels I feel like asking my neighbor do you believe in angels I do believe in angels Hallelujah I mean ask that man do you believe in angels foreign amen maybe someone has done something for you maybe God has given you forever before somebody you can't even understand because angels are real things Because of You hallelujah amen when I hear what Russia is saying when I hear what Russia is saying what America is president the president of

anything good in himself he knew he was sinful not anymore that is Hallelujah that tricks on him foreign amen Hallelujah girls [Applause] this is The Shining it is tomato not tomorrow right now you may not feel it no it's alive you don't feel it it's actually I tell you in this kind of you now Hallelujah and when it Stripes something is happening on the inside that is changing your your mind I

resist this is foreign [Applause] [Music] rise up and walk come with silver and God I have land but thank God the light in them was making people work what was that third church it was not them oh the apostles in the book of Acts were not themselves Christ in the book of Acts of the Apostles the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles by The Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and Define it and make it lukewarm formal and Powers don't keep it brother this Spirit would want to make you look warm enough even when you come to church foreign ERS struggling with you let us sing and they feel so heavy I'm so happy in my mouth let me just dance the devil wants to defile us the devil wants us to be just a formal church let me tell you them oh God help us claim to believe the message no one can even say Amen when one is dark um what's happening understanding someone who is on fire hey man hallelujah hallelujah one day in a meeting hallelujah amen and there was a man who was really offended yesterday well if she doesn't do that I can't preacher Amen Let Me Tell You Charles up your hands dance and jump I can't breach at this church we have Liberty and freedom to worship the Lord will see the things the Bible says where the spirit of the Lord is there is but you see the devil wants to make the church form and Powerless gifts of the Spirit not gifts of the Spirit this is what the church has become even people playing instruments they have to be paid money foreign amen that's the church on fire and he says if you know who you are it exposes Saturn argumentation revealing his words they attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word that's what the devil wants to do to describe the word of God and and then cast it into the lack of France he cannot stand it you cannot stand this light of the world he knows how many oh are you listening he knows um [Applause] he knows that that she can do the Greater Works amen that's why the angel came today I'm just sitting there and Gideon was trying to hide that yeah he's trying to do the wishes do you know that the Lord is with you now of course with me [Music] they said no I don't believe it is God is Not only with you but you are mighty man of God foreign foreign uh if I tell you a mighty man of God right now I don't know what you would say it's not what you feel or you think you are the children it is what this light has made it and in this church there are many preachers going to come out of here and some of you who feel that you can never even amount to anything some of you may end up being great men and women of God and I'm not saying you might suggests Hallelujah just cast the Revelation you will be an invisible Army and you will freeze that court in your own time my time is going my time is rushing now look here and Gideon said unto him hey oh my Lord [Music] be with us that the Lord is with me now because the engine holding the Lord is with you and foreign why then is all this befall in US until you get tired of your situation and you ask such questions you may never change with me why this this is our fathers told us did not the Lord bring us out of from Egypt City but now the brothers for seconds and they delivered us into the hands of the media and this boy knew his God but he was saying something is missing the secret I want to give you before God comes to you and now some of you are going to receive a reason to why God chose you know if God comes to you is because you always desired him for his presence and was seeking for something great it could be a solution but you do not know how to do it yeah disappointed and so when the angel come and speak to you Hallelujah yeah amen you don't say this don't be with us why am I even hiding watching them personal questions why are they stealing everything so much I want to see him I want to see him Hallelujah hey if you have that hunger in your soul foreign [Music] Hallelujah someone receiving it as a prophecy and if you receive it it's gonna happen and I'm not just shouting I'm speaking the real chance of the world and in the next service with that he said now I will go a little deeper for you and you will see how God used and you'll see how God demonstrated to Gideon that he is just a picture yes Hallelujah I have a few parts here speak on the Miracles and the power of God I believe in miracles in the power of God in the power of the gospel of Christ is that somebody else and I love him with all my heart and I know he is if the whole world goes and doubts says he doesn't put a doubt in my mind the others put doubts I believe God can change myself a real picture of churches today that don't believe in the description they just couldn't believe it now remember remember there is a people today that don't believe it they don't believe in the Holy Spirit they don't believe that the Holy Ghost governs the church sometimes he worried too much but the church has made program repress the Holy Spirit program must never outright the holy books foreign foreign he went crazy you know and you know these songs we sing which is especially my name is all right don't go out of order okay no email s foreign [Music] [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Music] and my buddies [Music] [Music] amenities [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] and such a man comes up sings a song that you know is in the spirit made everybody excited everybody happy let everybody jump hello guess what someone has taken a moment of praise hmm anymore You See It Happened One chat with something about that started [Music] and it took everybody out of the spirit but here's what I love about the messages that we are not our churches are not run by program a mechanism Canada said everything is [Music] that they have replaced the spirit of the leadership of the spirit of God in there he says let's sing one or two songs you don't even remember according to that program you're out of order context you understand it's not programs how can he preach foreign foreign [Music] Hallelujah let me finish this other course as I promised you he says it says these study says they don't believe in the Holocaust to be that leading the governing the church they don't believe in miracles they don't believe in science they don't believe in the Supernatural I just can't believe it now that spirit is not nothing new they don't believe in the living in the Miracles they don't believe in speaking in time if the brother brother can you play for me a very good worshiping the fly [Music] and everybody's worshiping everybody [Music] so while we are worshiping someone bursts out in town tonight the person with the microphone also increases if the Holy Spirit has shifted from the from the song leader or whatever it is then how you ought to pause and listen to what the spirit is that right and the brother who is playing that's why the people who were playing these instruments must be holy ghost films by the way you Brothers if you don't have the Holy Ghost you must seeking to you and you're also speaking to somebody else if you don't have the Holy Ghost you must seek you cannot be playing instruments I'm sorry so anyway this is because without it the very thing we are trying to do together it's not me speaking because if this brother is not in the spirit he will not sense what God is doing here you understand maybe there's somebody suffering and God wanted to tell them something and he's going to take them out of their troubles and this one it must all be connected do you understand that's the Holy Ghost taking control of the services [Music] the greatest [Music] let's see oh he and as he was singing she wasn't playing as this brother's playing and I'm not saying it's not it's not in the spirit the sister was in the spirit and she was playing and playing now the eyes were even closed brother sister if you can't play when your eyes are closed and you're worshiping you are not playing you are just twisting God you must be in the spirit whatever we do we must be in the spirit because we believe in miracles we're having the power of God if I can't preach in the spirit then I shouldn't preach and the sister was playing according to us because it's free she went out of water but yeah because she went in the spirit she played and played them and she played that way guess what the piano continued hallelujah hallelujah we won't be honest we want you tourists who will not breathe who will let the holy ghosts that's what we need in our lives let me tell you if we don't have that probation we are dead and formal foreign thing the Pharisees don't believe they don't believe in a supernatural someone comes to sing a special song well of course it's his special song we don't want people to come here for a shower we are tired and sick of that let me go and show them I know English manual resume let me go and show them again I can sing and I can move the mountains don't don't come we would rather not have a special song of yourself [Music] the only thing that can make a difference when the light comes in then you're going to sing a song your people are not going to say this is I'll praise the name of Allah and then these things it do you know if we take and heed them see you got to be quiet I need to be quiet God is preparing us for something greater on rich and richer man in this Fellowship let me tell you that's what it is God is preparing our minds that's better sister Here Come and sing a song you know you know what if you're not prayed if you run with it upon the Lord don't even come to say please man a little more me as a pastor or the brothers we should be sensitive to the spirit of God let the Holy Ghost finish his work that is and I wrap it up with this last report says there is some people of today that do not believe in miracles they say they just can't believe that there is such a thing as miracles in this Modern Age I don't mean to say anything bad about that person but they are spiritually they are now I'm spiritual they are blind
