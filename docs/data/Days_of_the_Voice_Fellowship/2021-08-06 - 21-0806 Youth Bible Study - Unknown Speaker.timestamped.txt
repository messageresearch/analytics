[57:10] so
[57:24] so
[57:38] so
[57:52] so
[58:02] [Applause]
[58:06] so
[58:20] so
[58:34] so
[58:48] so
[59:02] so
[59:16] so
[59:30] so
[59:44] so
[59:58] so
[1:00:12] so
[1:00:26] so
[1:00:40] so
[1:00:54] so
[1:01:08] so
[1:01:22] so
[1:01:36] so
[1:01:50] so
[1:02:04] uh
[1:02:11] thank you
[1:02:32] is
[1:02:46] it
[1:03:28] uh
[1:03:56] um
[1:04:09] that's why went to the woman
[1:04:14] and seduced her
[1:04:22] someone wants to add on that
[1:04:38] read for me and rather than
[1:04:42] say that the serpent was close to human
[1:04:52] beings
[1:05:05] it was between the chimpanzees
[1:05:18] and then because it was
[1:05:46] that's how the supremacy
[1:05:56] do you have something you want to say
[1:06:16] yes
[1:06:29] by jesus
[1:06:44] ezekiel
[1:06:59] feel knowledgeable so
[1:07:03] they therefore saturn
[1:07:07] used use the serpent
[1:07:10] to bring uh to bring
[1:07:13] to bring his seed in the human race
[1:07:18] because therefore there is no way he was
[1:07:20] going to produce himself
[1:07:22] because he's also a spirit so he had to
[1:07:25] use
[1:07:26] something that is physical
[1:07:35] okay now i would like us uh to
[1:07:38] understand this
[1:07:39] part very clearly because it seems to me
[1:07:43] that people either not understand this
[1:07:47] part
[1:07:48] or their understanding of which is not
[1:07:51] food
[1:07:52] okay you need to have a full
[1:07:55] understanding
[1:07:56] of the good for you to be able to
[1:07:58] benefit to have the full benefits of it
[1:08:01] so i'd like us to look at
[1:08:05] i'd like us to look at the
[1:08:09] can you read from here is where
[1:08:13] yes how are you reading yes
[1:08:18] here is where we receive the tribulation
[1:08:26] okay now here he's explaining what
[1:08:28] exactly happened yes
[1:08:29] so can we now here
[1:08:33] the word says that he was
[1:08:41] okay so before you check this at any
[1:08:44] levels
[1:08:45] i want you to understand hey are you
[1:08:49] okay you don't seem to be you know
[1:08:52] by the way if anyone is not you you
[1:08:55] shouldn't
[1:08:55] really come to attend because you
[1:08:57] disrupt others now look
[1:08:59] uh from what it is that you are reading
[1:09:03] before we go to any explanation or deep
[1:09:06] revelations you need to first understand
[1:09:09] what took place
[1:09:11] like the brother joel was saying the
[1:09:13] first thing
[1:09:14] was to understand what the trees are yes
[1:09:17] what are the trees
[1:09:18] that were in the middle of the garden
[1:09:21] there were how many trees two trees
[1:09:24] the first tree is and the other trees
[1:09:30] of knowledge of good and evil so we have
[1:09:32] two trees one is the tree of life
[1:09:34] and then the tree of knowledge of good
[1:09:36] and evil now
[1:09:38] both these trees were in the middle of
[1:09:40] the garden but
[1:09:41] how are we able to know that of course i
[1:09:42] do not want us to go back in the bible
[1:09:44] with the old testament
[1:09:45] in the genesis and then we start reading
[1:09:47] that but i want you to understand it
[1:09:50] that uh uh just a moment
[1:09:54] for your understanding i think you might
[1:09:56] meet with that portion of genesis
[1:09:59] let's get there
[1:10:06] read chapter 2 verses
[1:10:09] 15 genesis
[1:10:23] and the lord god commanded the man
[1:10:25] saying of
[1:10:27] every tree from the garden though may is
[1:10:29] freely eat
[1:10:31] but of uh once again but of the tree of
[1:10:34] the knowledge of
[1:10:35] wait a moment over every air in every
[1:10:38] tree
[1:10:39] out of the garden down my ears
[1:10:42] what trees are these
[1:10:48] and the lord god took the man and put
[1:10:50] him into the garden of eden and
[1:10:52] dressed and keep it and the lord god
[1:10:54] commanded the man saying of
[1:10:56] every tree of the garden of that may is
[1:10:58] freely eat so now
[1:11:00] because i told you excuse me
[1:11:03] that a tree means person so someone is
[1:11:05] asking me
[1:11:06] are these also people that's a good
[1:11:09] question
[1:11:10] ain't it please open your mind now
[1:11:13] i want to bring this in a very simple
[1:11:15] way for you to understand and share this
[1:11:16] impossible
[1:11:18] so these people also know these are not
[1:11:21] people
[1:11:22] you need to understand that scripture
[1:11:24] has compounded meaning
[1:11:25] there is always the meaning that is
[1:11:27] meaning and then there is also
[1:11:29] another meaning that is more spiritual
[1:11:32] okay so many people can read the
[1:11:34] scripture and they take the meaning
[1:11:36] they are outside meaning which they see
[1:11:38] but then there is a deeper meaning there
[1:11:40] is a depth of revelation usually
[1:11:42] there is the me the other meaning that
[1:11:43] people just underlook and somehow
[1:11:46] they are not able to see it so i i
[1:11:49] expect this verse to be here because i'm
[1:11:51] still explaining
[1:11:52] so yeah it says at a tree but but of the
[1:11:55] tree of knowledge of good and hip okay
[1:11:58] and then of every tree of the garden
[1:12:00] that may is freely
[1:12:02] eat it so now this is talking or
[1:12:05] referring to the other trees which we
[1:12:07] are permissible to eat
[1:12:09] which ones are those those ones are the
[1:12:12] apples
[1:12:14] the mangoes the jackal fruit
[1:12:17] come on now bananas
[1:12:26] let us be realistic are you telling me
[1:12:27] that adam and eve were not eating
[1:12:30] they suddenly were eating okay
[1:12:35] but yes it is true they were eating
[1:12:38] those things
[1:12:39] that's what that that is what their food
[1:12:41] what their food was
[1:12:43] but then when you go to verse 17 are you
[1:12:46] following
[1:12:47] yes please that's less for us for us
[1:12:51] but of the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:12:53] evil
[1:12:55] read with me now thou shalt not
[1:12:58] eat of it for in the day that thou he
[1:13:02] destroyed
[1:13:05] amen but of the tree of knowledge
[1:13:08] of good and evil thou shalt not eat of
[1:13:11] you so
[1:13:12] that's the only tree which he tells them
[1:13:15] do not eat the tree of
[1:13:19] the tree off yeah hey
[1:13:22] thank you some people thought that the
[1:13:24] tree of lord is one the tree of good is
[1:13:25] one the tree of
[1:13:27] evil is another the tree of knowledge is
[1:13:30] one and within it was good
[1:13:32] and if this is a tree is there one which
[1:13:34] was in the middle of the garden one of
[1:13:36] the trees which in the middle another
[1:13:37] tree which was in the middle of
[1:13:38] the garden was the tree where do we find
[1:13:44] that
[1:13:58] please
[1:14:01] [Music]
[1:14:08] just around there where he speaks about
[1:14:10] the tree
[1:14:12] of life
[1:14:22] okay i'm looking for it around
[1:14:29] probably
[1:14:40] okay
[1:14:44] let me get it from my baby
[1:15:06] [Music]
[1:15:08] the tree of life
[1:15:22] yes
[1:15:24] and out of the ground made their lord
[1:15:26] good to grow
[1:15:27] every tree that is listened to they said
[1:15:32] every tree
[1:15:36] that's the one that that's the kind of
[1:15:38] everything we're reading at first
[1:15:40] in the other part okay
[1:15:43] in chapter three where are we in chapter
[1:15:46] three
[1:15:50] verses
[1:15:54] okay uh-huh continue
[1:15:58] so this is a tree which was
[1:16:01] which the lord god made to grow
[1:16:05] the end was placed onto the site and
[1:16:08] good for food
[1:16:10] okay yes these were the ones i told you
[1:16:12] that they were brutal
[1:16:15] i'm speaking in ethiopia you know those
[1:16:17] other trees
[1:16:18] yeah those the names you mentioned those
[1:16:21] were the ones which were good for
[1:16:24] food and they were in the garden also
[1:16:28] the tree of life also individuals
[1:16:32] the tree of life also so now as he has
[1:16:36] mentioned the other trees he also goes
[1:16:38] ahead to mention the tree of life
[1:16:40] also in the midst of the garden
[1:16:46] and
[1:16:48] have you seen what i'm talking about so
[1:16:50] how many trees how many
[1:16:51] types of categories of trees one
[1:16:58] the second the third
[1:17:02] [Music]
[1:17:07] now the categories that we are looking
[1:17:09] at
[1:17:10] here are the last two categories because
[1:17:13] those ones were in the middle east
[1:17:16] of the garden it is saturday go down to
[1:17:18] verse
[1:17:19] 17.
[1:17:25] okay right there ah read verse 16.
[1:17:42] for
[1:17:48] you see yes so now it tells him this
[1:17:51] tree is not good for food don't eat it
[1:17:56] don't what and you can he says that the
[1:18:00] dead that thou shalt eat or beat that
[1:18:01] church
[1:18:02] so what is the tree
[1:18:06] now what is the street the first tree
[1:18:08] was the tree of life therefore
[1:18:10] the second tree is also a person yes
[1:18:13] if because these were the two trees in
[1:18:15] the middle of the garden
[1:18:17] the tree of life which is jesus christ
[1:18:18] and the tree of
[1:18:20] knowledge of good and evil that is the
[1:18:22] serpent
[1:18:23] all right not eve someone was telling me
[1:18:26] that that is evil no
[1:18:28] that is the tree of knowledge which has
[1:18:31] good and evil in it two things need good
[1:18:34] and bad
[1:18:34] who is that one that's the devil
[1:18:38] amen uh-huh so i want to show you now
[1:18:41] scripture to prove that
[1:18:42] amen
[1:18:45] okay go to genesis 3 1.
[1:18:54] now the serpent was more subtle than the
[1:18:57] beast than any beast of the field which
[1:19:00] the lord god had made and he said that
[1:19:03] to the woman
[1:19:04] yeah god said him shall not eat of every
[1:19:08] tree of the garden
[1:19:10] and the woman said that to the sabbath
[1:19:12] we may eat of the fruit of the trees
[1:19:14] of the garden but of the fruit of the
[1:19:18] tree
[1:19:19] which is in the midst of the garden god
[1:19:21] has said
[1:19:22] he shall not eat of it neither shall we
[1:19:24] touch it
[1:19:25] did god say that we should not touch it
[1:19:29] but it is if who is emphasizing that we
[1:19:32] shall not even touch it but god said he
[1:19:34] should not
[1:19:35] eating period you should not you will
[1:19:38] not eat the fruit of it
[1:19:40] but you said you shall also touch it
[1:19:43] so okay
[1:19:46] so here
[1:19:51] the bible says genesis 31 says what is
[1:19:54] that genesis 3 1.
[1:20:01] can you read that yes now the subject
[1:20:04] was more
[1:20:05] subtle than any beast of the field the
[1:20:07] subject was more
[1:20:09] subject very intelligent very cunning
[1:20:13] than any beast
[1:20:16] it was also a beast
[1:20:20] people i wanted to follow me here this
[1:20:22] is a very important subject
[1:20:23] and i don't want you to misunderstand me
[1:20:26] if you understand it today you're going
[1:20:28] to explain it to your friends in a
[1:20:29] very good way that's right it will even
[1:20:31] make them
[1:20:33] really need this message okay so follow
[1:20:36] me cause if you have your opinion and
[1:20:37] you're ready
[1:20:38] it will be good for you right number one
[1:20:40] we have what are the coverage
[1:20:41] the tree of life was jesus christ was
[1:20:45] god
[1:20:46] the free of knowledge of good and evil
[1:20:48] we are trying to
[1:20:49] establish who it was now
[1:20:53] i want you to separate two things here
[1:20:55] before we even go into this tree
[1:20:57] because it sometimes may seem as if it
[1:20:59] is one
[1:21:00] but also it is different or separate two
[1:21:03] things one
[1:21:04] mr serpent who is a beast
[1:21:08] and mr serpent who is that who is the
[1:21:10] devil are two separate things
[1:21:14] who understands it raise up your hand
[1:21:18] okay good shame how many explanations
[1:21:21] are fortunate the spirit
[1:21:29] that use that one the flesh
[1:21:33] is
[1:21:36] the least
[1:21:56] yes before we even continue people
[1:21:59] please follow me this is a very critical
[1:22:01] study
[1:22:03] mr serpent the beast
[1:22:06] was not a snake
[1:22:10] he was not as a problem snake
[1:22:13] he was a beast read three one again
[1:22:18] now the serpent was muslim still than
[1:22:21] any beast of the field
[1:22:22] so god is categorizing mr and among uh
[1:22:26] beasts not reptiles that's right
[1:22:29] is not a beast that's true god is
[1:22:32] categorizing mr serpent
[1:22:34] among the beasts so mr serpent
[1:22:38] forget about that his name sounds like a
[1:22:40] snake he was not a snake
[1:22:43] he was an upright beast we have beasts
[1:22:46] like
[1:22:48] lion uh-huh abs uh-huh
[1:22:54] what are the characteristics of a beast
[1:22:57] sister
[1:22:59] rachel what are characteristics of abyss
[1:23:00] number one
[1:23:04] the mind might not have fun right i just
[1:23:06] don't have fire not all of them are fun
[1:23:08] really
[1:23:08] don't they yes
[1:23:14] yeah but not all of them are right that
[1:23:15] i want real characteristics
[1:23:19] yeah well yeah yeah this is wild because
[1:23:21] of the fall
[1:23:22] before the fall it wasn't really white
[1:23:24] uh-huh
[1:23:26] volumes yes that's the first one the
[1:23:28] first characteristics of a base
[1:23:30] is that it has four limbs what does that
[1:23:33] mean
[1:23:34] some may wonder what i read what the
[1:23:36] what do they mean by limbs
[1:23:41] it means it has some why do we call it
[1:23:43] limbs and no legs or hands because
[1:23:45] sometimes
[1:23:46] others may only use use through other
[1:23:49] hand
[1:23:49] as hands and they do like a what is this
[1:23:52] is it opposite
[1:23:53] mother of some you know the opposite
[1:23:56] they can
[1:23:56] walk with the two and sometimes they can
[1:23:59] yeah so
[1:23:59] you can see that uh it's the beast but
[1:24:02] it has two four limbs
[1:24:03] but we are not saying four legs or
[1:24:05] fronts but
[1:24:06] it can be legs all of them or it can be
[1:24:09] two legs and
[1:24:10] like you you can set walk like a car or
[1:24:12] if you want
[1:24:14] but the issue is you have four limbs
[1:24:16] okay
[1:24:17] so this beast was also having full names
[1:24:22] like all the others another
[1:24:28] characteristics
[1:24:30] wait before we go there now because
[1:24:32] that's a bit different
[1:24:33] okay i'm talking about all this
[1:24:37] uh-huh another characteristics of
[1:24:40] this they produce
[1:24:44] they can reproduce they can
[1:24:48] reproduce they met with the females and
[1:24:50] they can bring forth
[1:24:52] life okay so they have a seed
[1:24:56] if they're males or they have eggs if
[1:24:59] they are
[1:25:00] females we understand that yes uh-huh
[1:25:03] another catalyst of the of this
[1:25:22] okay then another one
[1:25:28] okay fine right now we are going into
[1:25:30] the science okay
[1:25:31] but okay but i wanted they kind of eat
[1:25:35] yes they eat and excrete
[1:25:39] huh what's another characteristic
[1:25:45] okay fine you have had all those
[1:25:48] characteristics
[1:25:49] this mr serpent was a what it
[1:25:52] means doing all these things that's the
[1:25:53] second week
[1:25:57] mr servant was a beast
[1:26:01] and there is something different on
[1:26:03] mishappen from
[1:26:04] all the other beasts that were in or in
[1:26:07] the in the garden
[1:26:10] it says that he was the most subtle
[1:26:15] he was the wisest he was the cleverest
[1:26:18] he was the most intelligent
[1:26:21] he was very kind he was very wise you
[1:26:23] understand you could even talk
[1:26:26] hallelujah today we have beasts but some
[1:26:29] of them can't talk like a chimp
[1:26:30] kind of can achieve talk actually a
[1:26:33] champ already is waiting to talk but you
[1:26:34] can do everything and
[1:26:36] everything i was watching the other day
[1:26:38] a video on youtube
[1:26:39] someone i think one day he was with a
[1:26:42] champ and then he ready to go to the
[1:26:43] wild
[1:26:44] and then he went in the wild after some
[1:26:46] years to reunite with it
[1:26:48] to like uh get back to eat and they
[1:26:51] become you know
[1:26:52] to meet you and greet it like that so
[1:26:54] when he went there
[1:26:55] they weren't safe they wanted him he
[1:26:57] said don't go there this thing they come
[1:26:59] here kill you now now it is white
[1:27:01] no it is from when it was a baby so you
[1:27:02] would not give so he went there
[1:27:05] in the wild and he found it there and
[1:27:07] the thing
[1:27:08] after a long time it came and then when
[1:27:11] it saw him it went to him and hugged him
[1:27:14] he did give you what is that this is
[1:27:18] even have affection they understand like
[1:27:22] human beings almost
[1:27:24] they they cannot talk because they
[1:27:27] cannot talk but this one
[1:27:29] mrs happened who was talking even
[1:27:32] hey this mr happened but i'm actually if
[1:27:35] you were reading here
[1:27:36] he says it was almost
[1:27:42] you know talking it had a space even
[1:27:46] for a soul but it never had a soul
[1:27:49] that's right the only thing which the
[1:27:52] pirate said from a human being is that
[1:27:53] it never had
[1:27:54] a soul but the rest of the things that
[1:27:57] human beings
[1:28:11] there are many animals that today
[1:28:14] manifest those characteristics that i'm
[1:28:15] talking
[1:28:16] separately but all those characters were
[1:28:18] on one beast
[1:28:21] and distribution was in the garden yes
[1:28:24] with even adam and everyone else so it
[1:28:27] was
[1:28:27] an animal didn't that be the problem you
[1:28:29] understand it's not a devil you know
[1:28:31] it was just around did you have an issue
[1:28:34] you get the point
[1:28:35] yeah but where the problem
[1:28:39] came from is when mr saban from
[1:28:42] heaven came down amen are you following
[1:28:46] me
[1:28:47] go to your book of revelation so that
[1:28:49] whatever we are reading you can't
[1:28:51] know we are not getting it from our own
[1:28:53] ideas we're taking it from the bible
[1:29:02] revelation chapter 20 chapter
[1:29:07] 12 verse 9.
[1:29:10] can you read someone who is there please
[1:29:12] quickly

[1:29:43] out into the earth

[1:29:53] other
[1:29:54] side that i'm talking about he came from
[1:29:56] where
[1:29:57] from heaven who is he that there but he
[1:29:59] that all happened

[1:30:08] heaven and he did not come along he came

[1:30:13] angels and remember they were spiritual
[1:30:18] beings they were not having a body like
[1:30:21] us

[1:33:22] that
[1:33:23] was repaired in a day in a day that thou
[1:33:25] wast
[1:33:26] so this is not psy
[1:33:30] a man on earth because this one was
[1:33:32] created
[1:33:33] he is an angel that's how we are able to
[1:33:36] know
[1:33:37] but also we find out he was also in
[1:33:38] heaven the god of god
[1:33:41] are you hearing yes but let us know what
[1:33:44] you read this is what you can be sure
[1:33:45] that he was an angel
[1:33:46] verse 14. foreign
[1:34:06] have you seen that yes so where was he
[1:34:09] also
[1:34:11] on the on in heaven in the holy mountain
[1:34:13] of god
[1:34:14] and he was the anointed
[1:34:19] you know you know there are many types
[1:34:20] of angels
[1:34:22] i care about this one over six weeks
[1:34:28] yes yes six weeks
[1:34:31] he can he asked you for flying to cover
[1:34:34] his feet
[1:34:36] and to wash me
[1:34:39] and he is always
[1:34:42] the presence of god this one was one of
[1:34:45] the generals
[1:34:47] okay that's how we were able to know
[1:34:49] that
[1:34:50] he was on the mount of god that's why he
[1:34:54] was so proud and he felt like oh my i
[1:34:56] should really go higher so that i can be
[1:34:58] good
[1:34:58] and he yeah yeah you know you people we
[1:35:01] can also make our own kingdom yeah you
[1:35:03] know selling the angels there
[1:35:04] angels angels there come on i can't
[1:35:06] believe god can't you see i am more
[1:35:08] powerful
[1:35:10] i can't even sing you know and then you
[1:35:12] know he showed up and everything ah
[1:35:14] we can make it and and when god saw that
[1:35:19] he said michael said michael can finish
[1:35:21] it go and deal with it
[1:35:23] so he came down with also his
[1:35:26] army of angels i'm imagining what was
[1:35:28] what it was like in heaven
[1:35:30] oh god was also faced with rappers one
[1:35:33] time
[1:35:33] my god he was first with the rebels who
[1:35:36] wanted to recover his kingdom
[1:35:38] this thing you are saying here on earth
[1:35:39] did not begin on
[1:35:45] he said michael yes my lord go and
[1:35:47] finish it up
[1:35:48] michael came and he flies around there
[1:35:52] and you know and then and then lucifer
[1:35:54] also
[1:35:55] name
[1:36:09] it is says very very well what was in
[1:36:11] him
[1:36:13] [Music]
[1:36:15] the anointing he was not just killed but
[1:36:17] he was anointed
[1:36:21] and i have said this so god has made him
[1:36:22] like that that was upon the old
[1:36:25] has walked up and down in the midst of
[1:36:27] the storms of fire
[1:36:28] michael you don't know what i can do he
[1:36:30] said okay you come
[1:36:32] bring it on they said i said michael you
[1:36:34] know i have almost three quarters over
[1:36:35] the whole heaven
[1:36:36] enjoy
[1:36:43] they came and they but the ground was
[1:36:45] drawn and they started hitting one
[1:36:47] another hit
[1:36:48] one another i tell you there was really
[1:36:50] war in heaven
[1:37:05] up in the dragon he goes in the dragon
[1:37:06] because you are now a
[1:37:08] kind of uh rebelled against what was
[1:37:12] the status quo in heaven you know so
[1:37:14] they said
[1:37:15] you know started rebelling and they were
[1:37:16] fighting on these angels also they kept
[1:37:18] they fought
[1:37:19] when michael you know
[1:37:25] you know yesterday
[1:37:30] now i'm going to throw you on
[1:37:36] he threw him down on the earth and he
[1:37:39] came on the earth
[1:37:40] that all happened lucifer the devil that
[1:37:42] all happened
[1:37:44] he came now he was in heaven but he came
[1:37:47] now
[1:37:48] down to the earth are you seeing now
[1:37:51] this one is unfolding
[1:37:52] yes read verse 15 thou was
[1:37:55] perfect in thy ways
[1:37:59] from the dead was created
[1:38:02] [Applause]
[1:38:03] finish it up for me
[1:38:04] [Music]
[1:38:07] so in other words lucifer was perfect
[1:38:11] and dear
[1:38:14] someone seen something if you have seen
[1:38:16] it say amen
[1:38:18] amen what have you seen
[1:38:23] tell me what you'll
[1:38:29] you see are you connecting scripture are
[1:38:32] you studying scriptures oh you're just
[1:38:33] doing each group that is benedict yes
[1:38:38] god bless you and what goodness that
[1:38:41] perfection
[1:38:42] that is good is it yes
[1:38:50] yes so how do you summarize
[1:39:05] so what do you see there two things
[1:39:13] can we go back to our servant in genesis
[1:39:16] yes not even suffering the dream
[1:39:20] hey is someone getting the revelation
[1:39:23] now
[1:39:24] the tree of knowledge follow me look at
[1:39:27] me here the tree of knowledge oh
[1:39:30] and that was perfect in his way until
[1:39:35] we have found him we have found him my
[1:39:38] friends
[1:39:38] here in ezekiel 28 yes he is now telling
[1:39:42] us which
[1:39:43] tree of knowledge was the tree of
[1:39:46] knowledge is that
[1:39:47] all the serpents not the the suffering
[1:39:51] in the garden of heaven
[1:39:52] but that all happened bro
[1:39:59] that was the tree of knowledge sister
[1:40:06] peace
[1:40:09] which one we have two seconds here
[1:40:15] from where
[1:40:22] yeah ah you mean the three of us
[1:40:26] happened i was living in heaven
[1:40:31] thank you for trying sister you see so
[1:40:34] that's happened
[1:40:36] came down from heaven and
[1:40:39] he where did he go now
[1:40:44] it's okay where we have been executing
[1:40:46] where did he go
[1:40:47] that's why i said you should have
[1:40:48] absolutely
[1:41:01] we are progressing our study one the
[1:41:04] dream of knowledge
[1:41:05] of good and evil though the dream of
[1:41:08] life the tree of life was a person which
[1:41:10] was jesus christ
[1:41:11] and the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:41:13] evil was also
[1:41:15] which was the devil himself
[1:41:20] both of them were in the midst of the
[1:41:22] garden and god told them this we should
[1:41:24] not eat this honey should not work
[1:41:27] now a serpent the devil
[1:41:31] is the one that they were not supposed
[1:41:34] to eat
[1:41:36] meaning follow me please follow me
[1:41:38] quickly look at me here now
[1:41:40] we have the tree of knowledge of good
[1:41:42] and evil but when we are not supposed to
[1:41:44] eat it but the other trees including the
[1:41:47] tree of life they were supposed to
[1:41:50] eat so now the question is how are they
[1:41:53] eating the tree of life
[1:41:56] if you know they were eating the tree of
[1:41:57] life you will be
[1:41:59] very aware how the tree of knowledge and
[1:42:01] evil was eaten
[1:42:02] [Music]
[1:42:10] that is a very good point can you
[1:42:12] expound on it
[1:42:15] how are they in the tree of life they
[1:42:18] would
[1:42:19] accept the idea and let it work
[1:42:23] what is the idea what do you mean
[1:42:26] um
[1:43:10] who is disagreeing
[1:43:13] why have you not agreed fully because
[1:43:16] hey
[1:43:17] they say that
[1:43:36] let us look at the tree of life now how
[1:43:38] can you eat this one this way and
[1:43:40] this way you must eat it the same way
[1:43:42] yes so
[1:43:44] maybe you have a wrong understanding let
[1:43:46] us first look at the way
[1:43:48] they added your life on how was it eaten
[1:43:52] because like you've got a very good
[1:43:54] point you cannot eat this one this way
[1:43:56] and the other one
[1:43:57] another way it has to be in the same way
[1:44:00] of eating
[1:44:04] uh-huh
[1:44:13] amen god bless you your idea is the same
[1:44:16] as his
[1:44:17] only the other brought in a very liberal
[1:44:19] way and you wrote in a very
[1:44:21] a religious way but it's all the same
[1:44:24] to this to accept an idea to accept what
[1:44:27] someone has presented to you and make it
[1:44:29] part of your make it
[1:44:31] control your life to believe the words
[1:44:34] you have had
[1:44:35] i love that one to believe the ones you
[1:44:37] have had
[1:44:38] right now you're very busy eating hey
[1:44:41] you didn't
[1:44:42] know you're gonna be eating now
[1:44:45] that is why someone could look at and
[1:44:47] say oh you have changed what is
[1:44:48] happening to you
[1:44:49] and you tell them these days you eat
[1:44:50] well yes i eat you well look at my
[1:44:53] chicken
[1:44:54] because you have been eating food or you
[1:44:56] have been eating
[1:44:57] so even spiritually you have been eating
[1:44:59] that's why
[1:45:00] some of you have lost appetite for your
[1:45:02] friends that you had
[1:45:03] i believe there are some of you who have
[1:45:04] lost at least even up there for the
[1:45:06] things you used to do
[1:45:07] why are you losing appetite you know if
[1:45:09] you were poor and you were eating only
[1:45:11] in vineyards
[1:45:14] then when you become rich in the
[1:45:15] guillotine
[1:45:17] chicken and the salsa is the pod
[1:45:21] chicken
[1:45:27] when begin eating he sponsor faster food
[1:45:31] you lose the appetite of the ava you
[1:45:34] gotta pray
[1:45:35] these people what happens yeah these
[1:45:38] days
[1:45:39] kfc you understand because you think you

[1:50:42] he's drink his bacon food but the
[1:50:45] question is
[1:50:46] some people are cracking their eyes wide
[1:50:48] in their mind they remember jesus who
[1:50:50] was walking
[1:50:51] on the streets of jerusalem if that's
[1:50:53] what you grabbed your hands before
[1:50:55] please first wait to trap until you hear
[1:50:57] and receive the perfect reservation the
[1:51:00] flesh we are talking about
[1:51:02] they may be talking about is not the
[1:51:04] meat
[1:51:06] you know you know walking in jerusalem
[1:51:10] and you know his blood which was going
[1:51:12] through the veins which by now is very
[1:51:14] very dry
[1:51:18] when spilled on the cross it dried up
[1:51:21] didn't it
[1:51:22] yes so what what's life
[1:51:25] where is life in that brother somewhere
[1:51:29] where is life in that you may say
[1:51:33] brother sister
[1:51:35] the flesh the flesh is talking about is
[1:51:38] here
[1:51:39] in the form of the word
[1:51:43] [Applause]
[1:51:46] hallelujah
[1:51:48] hallelujah he shall have a balancing
[1:51:50] life
[1:51:51] in the bible say that he doesn't hear
[1:51:53] him my words and he believes given the
[1:51:55] scripture
[1:51:55] he and the believers he
[1:51:58] shall have everlasting life who said
[1:52:01] that
[1:52:02] the tree of life and remember the spirit
[1:52:06] the blood is talking about he's talking
[1:52:08] about the spirit
[1:52:09] that's right hallelujah when you receive
[1:52:11] the word of god
[1:52:12] you are saved until the day of your
[1:52:14] redemption so in other words it's
[1:52:15] talking about
[1:52:16] receiving the word believing the word
[1:52:18] and receiving the
[1:52:20] baptism of the holy ghost when you
[1:52:23] believe the word
[1:52:24] and if you see them so the holy ghost
[1:52:25] you are already eating and enjoying the
[1:52:27] tree of life
[1:52:30] ada was kicked out after they ate from
[1:52:33] the other wrong
[1:52:33] tree he was kicked out of heaven
[1:52:38] and they were they were chest out of the
[1:52:41] garden that was the atmosphere
[1:52:42] of
[1:52:47] friends please listen to me now you
[1:52:48] don't miss this point yes why were
[1:52:50] they chased out they were just out so
[1:52:52] that they don't have access
[1:52:54] to the trio right so that if they eat it
[1:52:56] they will have eternal life so therefore
[1:52:58] they were supposed to be chased out
[1:52:59] because that means
[1:53:01] everyone has sinned and there is no one
[1:53:03] who can have it in life anymore
[1:53:05] so from that time their life was cut off
[1:53:07] from the people
[1:53:08] but when jesus came hallelujah his blood
[1:53:11] restored everything
[1:53:13] his blood restored the access in the
[1:53:16] tree of life hallelujah
[1:53:17] he has now come as i am
[1:53:21] from heaven even when the peace of me
[1:53:24] shall
[1:53:26] and what is that is the what so we are
[1:53:28] yet no wonder sometimes you will hear
[1:53:30] the word you can feel street and feel
[1:53:32] happy why
[1:53:32] because you are eating yes hallelujah
[1:53:36] because you are eating i don't know if
[1:53:38] you hear this while you get bored let me
[1:53:39] tell
[1:53:40] you there is a wrong wrong problem with
[1:53:41] you there's a very very big problem with
[1:53:43] you
[1:53:45] if you ever hear the word there is a big
[1:53:48] problem on you
[1:53:49] as a matter of fact you might even be i
[1:53:51] don't want to say what
[1:53:54] but in the sin of god
[1:53:57] amen the word should make you happy
[1:54:00] the world should make you excited the
[1:54:02] world should even make you talk tongues
[1:54:04] the wife should make you shout they want
[1:54:06] to make you

[1:54:30] someone even if they try to stop
[1:54:33] you will say me at all let me rejoice
[1:54:35] hallelujah
[1:54:36] when jesus was here on earth they tested
[1:54:39] some people tested of that bread of life
[1:54:42] some were healed
[1:54:43] from their sicknesses eyes were
[1:54:45] delivered from there whatever
[1:54:47] that's what the view of life does when
[1:54:49] you hear the word you believe it when
[1:54:50] you receive the word of god
[1:54:52] you will be sealed tree of life and it
[1:54:54] therefore it must change your
[1:54:55] life from inside out
[1:54:59] let me tell you you can never lie to me
[1:55:00] that someone can hear this one
[1:55:02] and they remain the same after two
[1:55:04] months three months four months six
[1:55:06] there is no change that one forget it
[1:55:08] don't even reach them leave them around
[1:55:10] this one it must change you you must be
[1:55:13] able to say
[1:55:14] all of you at your level that i am no
[1:55:16] longer what i used to be if you can't
[1:55:18] say that then there is a big problem
[1:55:20] with you
[1:55:21] if the things that you should overcome
[1:55:22] between the uh i'll not say 20 years
[1:55:25] outside five years ago if they feel that
[1:55:27] you should have become five years ago

[1:55:57] the light
[1:55:58] jesus the light of the world he was
[1:56:00] coming down every evening and pushing
[1:56:02] preaching
[1:56:03] to them and they were better there in
[1:56:04] the garden of amen
[1:56:07] amen amen then he goes back he comes
[1:56:09] back again next evening
[1:56:12] amen every evening he was coming to
[1:56:14] check on them
[1:56:15] and whenever he was coming he was
[1:56:17] speaking revealing himself to them
[1:56:19] and they were saying amen what is it the
[1:56:22] truth of eating it by the saving
[1:56:24] amen you eat by receiving an idea
[1:56:28] you keep by believing what someone else
[1:56:30] is telling you
[1:56:31] amen so if you eat bad stuff if you eat
[1:56:33] lots of stuff if you eat practice
[1:56:35] if you eat that that's why the things
[1:56:37] that you you you watch on your whatever

[1:56:44] being preaching now
[1:56:46] but i'm telling you that this thing you
[1:56:48] know you're going there in the on
[1:56:49] youtube on this and nearly beginning
[1:56:50] what you're watching those things and
[1:56:52] then
[1:56:52] you know what i'm gonna do but i'm just
[1:56:54] seeing what

[1:57:02] you eat those you know if you eat
[1:57:04] those women bouncing bouncing themselves
[1:57:06] like that you also
[1:57:08] begin because
[1:57:23] if the bible says there in somewhere he
[1:57:24] says they have a name that they leave
[1:57:26] but yet they are dead
[1:57:28] amen the church many of them are calling
[1:57:31] themselves christians
[1:57:32] you think they are their christians
[1:57:33] because of the outlook but actually
[1:57:35] inside they are dead
[1:57:36] muslims
[1:57:40] what happened am i eating so friends
[1:57:43] eating the hearing
[1:57:45] believing hearing organizing and acting
[1:57:49] hallelujah so if you hear the things of
[1:57:51] the world and you organize it and you
[1:57:53] actually you will become like the world
[1:57:55] and if you hear the word of god you
[1:57:56] recognize it you will act
[1:57:58] like a child of god like a son of god
[1:58:01] hallelujah
[1:58:03] eating his acting
[1:58:07] yes my brother is not eating his wife
[1:58:09] that is eating don't try to confuse
[1:58:11] people that is eating
[1:58:12] eating is hearing and acting
[1:58:16] everything else comes out of that
[1:58:18] hallelujah
[1:58:32] because you're eating the word of god
[1:58:35] it's your life
[1:58:36] you really stop doing that why because
[1:58:38] you have heard
[1:58:41] yes hallelujah why would a woman become
[1:58:44] you know what
[1:58:52] why would they say a woman is expecting
[1:58:55] because she
[1:58:56] is she have she recognized she acted you
[1:58:58] got a point
[1:58:59] three things hearing recognizing acting
[1:59:03] are you understanding now yes
[1:59:06] so when you hear the word of god
[1:59:10] you recognize it you will act upon it
[1:59:14] is when she had
[1:59:18] the suffering now here is our
[1:59:21] place now there was two serpents the
[1:59:24] suffering on earth and the serpent frog
[1:59:29] this happened on earth and the serpent
[1:59:31] in heaven connived
[1:59:36] they agreed actually it was even more of
[1:59:39] an argument
[1:59:40] it was more of a hijack i've ever seen
[1:59:43] someone like that with someone
[1:59:45] hey you know someone when you find
[1:59:48] someone going before they get to their
[1:59:49] sister before they are married it means
[1:59:50] that that person is attacked by the
[1:59:52] devil
[1:59:52] the same way they never adapted that's
[1:59:53] happened
[1:59:55] when you come out of are eating doing
[1:59:58] don't you see any of them
[2:00:02] what was it that made you believe it's
[2:00:03] the devil right
[2:00:05] because they don't want them to be cast
[2:00:07] out and they never confused to be their
[2:00:09] friend and they never connected
[2:00:11] you see the devil spirit the devil is
[2:00:13] not afresh and blood
[2:00:15] you understand yes so the subject which
[2:00:18] came from heaven
[2:00:19] he comes down and enters
[2:00:24] into this serpent which was on earth it
[2:00:26] was a very gentle man by the way it was
[2:00:28] a gentle manner
[2:00:29] if you allow me to use that one there
[2:00:31] was no beast or any more
[2:00:33] closest to the human beings like it yes
[2:00:35] it would talk
[2:00:36] reason you understand i'm also more
[2:00:39] importantly he had a seat
[2:00:42] the goddess brothers he harvested
[2:01:21] going to select all of you brothers here
[2:01:24] have a seat sister does not have a seat
[2:01:28] brother when love made the seat you
[2:01:31] plant it in the garden what happened
[2:01:45] so this is
[2:01:50] uh that the subject had
[2:01:54] they never knew that and here now this
[2:01:56] the
[2:01:57] mystery is here the world thing is here
[2:02:00] they never knew i record the other
[2:02:02] surface the dev one this one i will call
[2:02:04] himself
[2:02:04] okay the devil knew yes
[2:02:08] are you following me yes the devil knew
[2:02:12] saturn that devil that what's happened
[2:02:15] he knew that would be mr serpent
[2:02:28] they never knew
[2:02:32] some of you have even gone away i have
[2:02:33] not gone now it isn't good you're
[2:02:35] following me
[2:02:36] look the devil knew that that this
[2:02:39] serpent's seat yeah can be able to
[2:02:43] mingle
[2:02:44] to unite with this with the egg of the
[2:02:46] woman
[2:02:47] to bring forth a child
[2:02:51] he never knew that there was very
[2:02:53] strategic in his attack
[2:02:55] that's why he came
[2:02:58] that happened first before he came to
[2:03:00] anyone he didn't want to scare him
[2:03:02] away because he was a spiritual if he
[2:03:04] hadn't even
[2:03:05] be achieved and even in any case if not
[2:03:08] he cannot enter evil adam because
[2:03:10] even adam had something which was
[2:03:12] protecting them does anyone know it
[2:03:18] that thing i'm going to talk about it on
[2:03:20] sunday what gives me grace
[2:03:22] and i'm prepared for it i'll talk about
[2:03:23] it on sunday anyone knows it
[2:03:40] so
[2:03:43] what
[2:03:48] okay now let me be hanging there as a
[2:03:51] question
[2:03:52] i'm going to deal with it on sunday so i
[2:03:54] want to be you
[2:03:57] all right i'm going to talk about it the
[2:03:58] whole service understanding
[2:04:00] what they had that affected them from
[2:04:01] the devil not incarnating them
[2:04:03] because they were not engaged even you
[2:04:05] today because of that
[2:04:07] all right leave that aside now
[2:04:10] eve follow me now eve
[2:04:14] this surprise was just there and the
[2:04:15] devil came here that is like they never
[2:04:17] entered those places and then they went
[2:04:19] straight in whatever you understand
[2:04:36] itself
[2:04:41] yeah you know how men do when they're
[2:04:43] going to attack
[2:04:46] you know so yeah you understand
[2:04:50] say arrived this happened realized that
[2:04:53] he has now
[2:04:54] gotten even new ideas which he had never
[2:04:57] gotten before
[2:04:59] you get a point yes so the servant
[2:05:02] realized
[2:05:03] he had been educated by something in
[2:05:06] evernote's troops
[2:05:07] something a story that can do this you
[2:05:09] know those ones those
[2:05:10] people who date women they realize they
[2:05:13] have got a new idea which they have not
[2:05:14] thought of before
[2:05:16] so this happened they never came in it
[2:05:18] and don't leave
[2:05:20] something you know what actually this
[2:05:22] eventually you can
[2:05:26] say okay fine so when something became
[2:05:28] sappet
[2:05:29] was not acting on its own accord that's
[2:05:32] why
[2:05:33] i feel sorry for something because
[2:05:35] serpent was a victim of circumstances
[2:05:38] you know something was not a problem
[2:05:40] this snake you see today
[2:05:41] it wasn't a problem that's why snake
[2:05:44] doesn't usually bite children
[2:05:47] but if you are double it will bite you
[2:05:49] you know
[2:05:50] children he knows this one i don't know
[2:05:52] what happened but this big one they know
[2:05:54] and
[2:05:54] they wouldn't even kill you on the scene
[2:05:56] but you can find a snake
[2:05:58] playing the child today and it is not
[2:06:00] biting
[2:06:02] these things no it is nature what
[2:06:04] happened
[2:06:05] here is what happened i'm telling you
[2:06:06] what happened so this servant now
[2:06:09] realizes that you can talk to eve talks
[2:06:13] so the ability object was already there
[2:06:15] that bit of reasoning was already there
[2:06:16] it was very kind of very wise then the
[2:06:19] devil
[2:06:20] came and connected it and gave it a mind
[2:06:22] a mindset
[2:06:23] so to come and be queen that's the one
[2:06:25] that the bible used
[2:06:26] big will do what you know what they
[2:06:29] really mean
[2:06:36] yes but do you understand yes
[2:06:39] yes what is the greedy
[2:06:43] i don't want to use that one yeah
[2:06:47] presenting a manifesto to something
[2:06:50] you are not making it again whether it
[2:06:52] is dramatic
[2:06:54] do you know what it is
[2:07:01] you know sister someone looks and he
[2:07:03] says hey you know you're beautiful
[2:07:07] [Music]
[2:07:09] then you begin you get something you
[2:07:11] begin to do it
[2:07:14] you know you know i love you you know
[2:07:17] when you hear that you're like you had
[2:07:20] war
[2:07:22] then you begin getting those filthy
[2:07:24] ideas in your age
[2:07:27] when that begins then it says no he said
[2:07:29] no i will not do it
[2:07:30] no please if you do it no i'll be
[2:07:32] comfortable even if you do
[2:07:34] not please leave me alone you know that
[2:07:37] kind of
[2:07:38] thinking that kind of ideas this is
[2:07:40] exactly what happened
[2:07:42] with the serpent
[2:07:46] now what was the eating that if
[2:07:50] that is the point of coming to when the
[2:07:53] serpent came to eat he was very naive
[2:07:59] and some of you now are running into
[2:08:00] some other words
[2:08:03] he was very happy that is the
[2:08:07] it is the truth it was very nice she did
[2:08:10] not know anything
[2:08:11] because she was just told don't do that
[2:08:14] it is bad
[2:08:15] just like you tell children don't do
[2:08:16] that it's what you train a child and
[2:08:19] you know that's it so god told them
[2:08:21] don't do
[2:08:22] that don't go that age because it's bad
[2:08:23] so they never
[2:08:25] for her maybe she even added not not to
[2:08:27] touch in a guru
[2:08:28] spirit you know that area not even
[2:08:31] you know meaning it is not um but
[2:08:34] because she was too excited to
[2:08:36] defend what god said she was she added
[2:08:39] on the world
[2:08:39] which is the reason why god said that
[2:08:41] women should no longer preach
[2:08:43] that's the reason by the way even when
[2:08:45] you check in the new testament
[2:08:46] in second timothy the first time of the
[2:08:48] chapter 2 where i said women
[2:08:50] should not preach he brings that issue
[2:08:53] do you want to check it yes that's right
[2:08:55] yeah check it
[2:08:56] out someone said i want to be only
[2:08:59] for you to continue the other story i'm
[2:09:01] coming back
[2:09:16] yes let the woman learn in
[2:09:19] some read
[2:09:30] why
[2:09:38] have you seen it now so that is the
[2:09:40] reason because
[2:09:42] he was deceived with a big wheel
[2:09:49] yes you know that's why you guys you
[2:09:51] know these boys of the world come to you
[2:09:53] again

[2:10:19] are worldly words they should not even
[2:10:21] enter your mouth
[2:10:22] i've used it for the sake of people here
[2:10:23] here but that is not right
[2:10:25] you know you begin saying i am
[2:10:29] what do you say instead of what should
[2:10:31] they say what

[2:10:46] let your mouth be creased by the word by
[2:10:49] the word and the word
[2:10:50] the holy spirit also by fire
[2:10:53] enters your mouth you cannot say some of
[2:10:55] these words amen

[2:11:00] so sister some of those men they come
[2:11:02] around you
[2:11:04] they begin now speaking such a bad words

[2:11:10] believe in it
[2:11:11] don't even give them time to discuss
[2:11:14] don't give it attention at all that's
[2:11:17] right because if you do
[2:11:18] you already created the away they will
[2:11:21] know even if you just ah
[2:11:23] leave me alone they will know hey no
[2:11:26] problem tomorrow you will say ah leave
[2:11:28] me alone
[2:11:30] the next day they will do the same thing
[2:11:32] they did because they will know that
[2:11:33] this man
[2:11:34] happened if they don't have the holy
[2:11:36] ghost
[2:11:37] they all know hi she will come to dance
[2:11:41] then he would begin promising you you
[2:11:42] can't do this
[2:11:48] then another day when they promise more
[2:11:51] things that
[2:11:52] leave me nowhere did you notice
[2:11:56] that's right facility was very high
[2:11:58] there he went on going
[2:11:59] down going down and teaching
[2:12:03] you know
[2:12:11] don't give them your time eh
[2:12:15] don't give them your time sister not
[2:12:17] allow these boys to
[2:12:18] you know we talked about the virtues
[2:12:20] there to disintegrate your virtues
[2:12:22] actually touching your body that's not
[2:12:24] right your body is not
[2:12:26] what your body is not
[2:12:30] a toy where everyone goes and you know
[2:12:33] some evil god they mess up everywhere
[2:12:35] your body is the temple of the lord amen
[2:12:38] it
[2:12:38] should be cherished hallelujah even you
[2:12:41] brother but the sisters god is special
[2:12:42] more than yours
[2:12:44] so if you're not allowed it's not a
[2:12:47] garbage you can't wear someone just
[2:12:48] comes in there
[2:12:50] you don't know their hands are having
[2:12:52] devils or not not levels they just
[2:12:54] you accept it that you also feel you
[2:12:57] know
[2:12:58] don't allow that kind of thing because
[2:13:00] you are a child but you have daughter of
[2:13:02] god
[2:13:03] amen you are going to heaven and your
[2:13:04] body is for you and the lord
[2:13:06] amen and when you get a husband for you
[2:13:08] and your husband hallelujah
[2:13:09] and before then it's for you and lord
[2:13:13] only
[2:13:14] a girl who allows a boy or a woman who
[2:13:16] allows a man
[2:13:17] to touch them or not they are husbands
[2:13:19] it means they themselves have problems
[2:13:21] okay actually that's why in the old
[2:13:24] testament
[2:13:25] i will take these things off one of
[2:13:26] these days in the old testament the
[2:13:28] bible tells us if a girl
[2:13:30] was arrested and she did not make an
[2:13:33] alarm
[2:13:33] they would stone her and the one was
[2:13:35] ripped
[2:13:37] they would watch the mission today
[2:13:38] because even now why did she make an
[2:13:40] alarm
[2:13:41] that you overcame you overcame me how
[2:13:43] could you ever why didn't you allow
[2:13:45] which means you were also part of what
[2:13:47] was happening you you you are
[2:13:50] enjoying the moment you understand so
[2:13:53] you should not
[2:13:54] you must always defend what is right and
[2:13:58] fight for what is right amen
[2:14:02] am i making sense in what i'm saying yes
[2:14:05] okay
[2:14:05] now this assad i hope you're following
[2:14:09] very well i just have
[2:14:10] prince i don't know someone called
[2:14:12] prince here i don't know if you're a
[2:14:13] real prince
[2:14:14] and then it's the priest and then sister
[2:14:16] alinda i hope you're also following
[2:14:18] because this is a very very sensitive
[2:14:19] subject
[2:14:20] now please can can you let
[2:14:24] not let this student stopped
[2:14:27] are you following me yes yes here we are
[2:14:31] the devil comes the devil
[2:14:34] because i'm saying that but really it's
[2:14:35] not the devil in
[2:14:37] in
[2:14:52] and it begins throwing those words
[2:14:55] uh if uh uh says
[2:14:59] uh mrs adam because she was woman which
[2:15:02] it means mrs other man
[2:15:04] part of a woman
[2:15:13] did god say
[2:15:16] that you shall not eat of all the kids
[2:15:18] in the garden
[2:15:20] what did she say what did she answer
[2:15:25] don't read we already what did she
[2:15:27] answer
[2:15:34] yes
[2:15:46] god said we should do it but he
[2:15:55] what does he mean his meaning
[2:15:58] god said we can eat everything but we
[2:16:01] should
[2:16:01] what he said we should now in this case
[2:16:04] let me rephrase this word
[2:16:06] what god said we should be here
[2:16:09] recognize and believe anything else
[2:16:13] but i mean believe every hear recognize
[2:16:15] and believe everything else
[2:16:17] but from him alone
[2:16:21] what he has told us he said we should
[2:16:22] believe it and nothing
[2:16:24] else and he told us not to believe
[2:16:28] anything yeah
[2:16:36] [Music]
[2:16:43] this tree they were eating the freeze
[2:16:46] the fruit
[2:16:47] of the tree what is it
[2:16:51] what is fornication what is about
[2:16:54] what is theft what is lies
[2:16:57] what are these things fruits of
[2:17:01] sea fruits of unbelief so the sin is
[2:17:04] unbelievable
[2:17:05] so what the god taught them not to do
[2:17:08] is not to unbelieve the word
[2:17:11] god told them to believe everything
[2:17:13] you're saying and not to believe
[2:17:14] anything else
[2:17:16] you understand so
[2:17:20] what did they do if she started hearing
[2:17:24] and trying to believe what someone else
[2:17:26] was saying that is the mistake she did
[2:17:29] so everything that came was as a result
[2:17:33] of that so what was the
[2:17:36] forbidden what
[2:17:40] the what is the forbidden fruit the
[2:17:42] forbidden fruit
[2:17:44] was hearing
[2:17:47] recognizing and
[2:17:51] acting on something that would
[2:17:54] be originated from god hearing another
[2:17:57] that was
[2:17:57] even called himself after he preached he
[2:17:59] said may i preach to you christ
[2:18:01] but if you read another come and preach
[2:18:03] another gospel that to you
[2:18:04] then whatever you let him be a cast that
[2:18:07] god said if you eat of it you are cast
[2:18:10] you're going to die
[2:18:11] okay so that is exactly the forbidden
[2:18:14] fruit the forbidden fruit
[2:18:15] is hearing another gospel
[2:18:18] are you hearing me now yes now another
[2:18:21] gospel can make you do anything
[2:18:24] and therefore the other gospel made her
[2:18:28] eventually entangle herself
[2:18:31] in adultery okay so adultery
[2:18:34] came as a result of her eating
[2:18:38] the wrong thing from the wrong tree
[2:18:42] eating from the wrong tree so the adult
[2:18:43] she was afraid
[2:18:45] from the wrong tree so she took the
[2:18:48] fruit
[2:18:49] and ate she accepted to commit adultery
[2:18:53] that's what it means
[2:18:54] she took the fruit and ate that's why
[2:18:57] the bible says that soul
[2:18:59] is the way of an adulteress woman
[2:19:02] she is and website and says i've done no
[2:19:04] evil but what is the eating of another
[2:19:07] woman it is committing adultery not sin
[2:19:11] it's committing what's adultery yes of
[2:19:14] course we have children here so
[2:19:15] i'll just keep it at that okay so
[2:19:17] adultery
[2:19:18] is engaging with another man that's not
[2:19:20] your husband oh
[2:19:22] and and then you um you ma
[2:19:25] your fat your father you understand
[2:19:28] so eve from that very moment she might
[2:19:31] have
[2:19:32] a sacred but you remember as venezuela
[2:19:35] has not even touched her yet
[2:19:36] so she might have version first with the
[2:19:39] suffering
[2:19:40] and when adam came the father says that
[2:19:43] she
[2:19:43] ate associated also listen to this now
[2:19:47] we ha he ate also
[2:19:51] with her so it wasn't something that was
[2:19:53] done by an individual it was done by two
[2:19:54] people
[2:19:55] at the same time together so here it
[2:19:58] also shows you that what she
[2:19:59] did with the devil she repeats with her
[2:20:02] husband but in this case
[2:20:03] it was her like treating the husband
[2:20:06] so what i want to say is
[2:20:10] the the the scripture is very very clear
[2:20:13] that the eating
[2:20:14] is hearing recognizing and acting yes
[2:20:17] and after she ate that idea the wrong
[2:20:20] ideas would go back to the first point
[2:20:22] after she had the wrong ideas she was so
[2:20:24] full
[2:20:26] of it that she partook over the use of
[2:20:30] those wrong ideas
[2:20:31] and practiced it hearing
[2:20:35] recognizing and acting she had
[2:20:38] a wrong opinion she asked she said she
[2:20:41] she had her opinion she recognized that
[2:20:43] it is good
[2:20:44] it is good for food and prison for the
[2:20:46] eyes and
[2:20:48] then she also did what she acted
[2:20:52] by committing adultery so that about
[2:20:54] today
[2:20:55] we always call it the original sin
[2:20:59] the original meaning the sin which was
[2:21:00] done first and belief
[2:21:02] was unbelievable refusing to believe the
[2:21:03] word right but that
[2:21:05] refused to believe the word resulted
[2:21:07] into a boundary so
[2:21:08] the the sea that is there in the world
[2:21:10] is only one but the man of warrior says
[2:21:11] that he's unbelievable
[2:21:14] why do you do the bad things that you do
[2:21:16] because you have the you know the truth
[2:21:17] not that you don't know
[2:21:18] but you refuse to believe it you decide
[2:21:20] what you just haven't
[2:21:22] you do it i will repent you do it
[2:21:25] i will do that and you do it you still
[2:21:28] you you fornicate you do that do that
[2:21:30] that is the original scene we're going
[2:21:32] to see is because you have refused to
[2:21:33] believe the word of god
[2:21:38] how many have seen it
[2:21:43] when next you are preaching this to
[2:21:45] somebody
[2:21:47] do not make a whole lot about
[2:21:51] the act make a whole lot about
[2:21:54] refusal to believe the world that is
[2:21:56] where the point lies
[2:21:58] then the act is the one that brings
[2:22:00] forth cain now
[2:22:02] the act is not bringing forth cain
[2:22:06] and he is lying of unbelievers
[2:22:09] yes because that is the sacristy now
[2:22:11] that's where it comes from
[2:22:13] are you seeing it yes hallelujah
[2:22:20] amen
[2:22:24] what was officially asked
[2:22:34] yes
[2:23:02] tree of life that is the point i'm
[2:23:06] coming in
[2:23:07] remember the way you eat the tree of
[2:23:09] life is doing with the tree of knowledge
[2:23:11] same way hearing believing
[2:23:14] recognizing and acting same way
[2:23:17] but the results differ
[2:23:21] you get a point now i'm going to show
[2:23:23] you two images it is even here
[2:23:25] where i'm talking about what is already
[2:23:27] here talk about it here
[2:23:30] let us continue let us continue we are
[2:23:32] going to get the answer
[2:23:33] uh yeah pick it quickly now everybody

[2:27:06] so that when we come to things like this
[2:27:07] it's easy for us to just cross and we go
[2:27:10] so now i'm reminding you something you
[2:27:12] don't even know okay what is that
[2:27:13] some of you behave as if you know yet
[2:27:16] you have never even heard of it
[2:27:18] okay there is that man
[2:27:21] who was a demon possessed in the garden
[2:27:24] in the
[2:27:24] tombs and then jesus came and those
[2:27:28] demons shouted from him he said please
[2:27:30] don't kill us
[2:27:30] it's not our timeline so that therefore
[2:27:32] knew is what he's doing yet so
[2:27:34] in the garden the god did not cast the
[2:27:35] suffering but he the devil but he cast
[2:27:38] the serpent
[2:27:38] he cast mr serpent on the earth that guy
[2:27:41] there
[2:27:41] he had his arms and his legs all
[2:27:43] disappeared and he became
[2:27:45] a snake now as we know it but before
[2:27:48] that happened he's a seed and they and
[2:27:51] the human being
[2:27:52] they mingled together and they formed a
[2:27:54] child so there's a connection between
[2:27:56] animals
[2:27:57] and the people and people don't know
[2:27:58] that's why they also form the teaching
[2:28:01] of evolution
[2:28:03] which states that man has was an animal
[2:28:06] but he went on evolving changing into a
[2:28:08] human
[2:28:08] being that he was like this you down
[2:28:14] if that is the case why are we not still
[2:28:16] changing what happened
[2:28:19] why not still changing so that is

[2:30:43] between the woman is the man is said and

[2:30:47] of course we know that the woman herself
[2:30:49] doesn't have seed
[2:30:50] okay he's talking about that that's it
[2:30:52] which will come out of a woman without
[2:30:54] the help of
[2:30:56] a man
[2:31:00] there would be a woman that would rather
[2:31:02] see
[2:31:03] without manny's intervention
[2:31:08] that is talking about okay
[2:31:14] it shall breathe bruise thy head
[2:31:17] and though shall we put with
[2:31:20] his feet
[2:31:23] if we give credit to the world that
[2:31:26] the woman did have the seed then the
[2:31:29] serpent must have surely
[2:31:31] had a sea ocean if the seed of
[2:31:34] the woman was a manchester apart from
[2:31:37] the man oh then the seed of the sabbath
[2:31:44] please please if god can show you this
[2:31:48] one i'm going to be happy
[2:31:51] all these labors will be not in pain
[2:31:56] is the core point here
[2:32:00] all of us will let us read it together
[2:32:02] one two three go
[2:32:05] [Music]
[2:32:08] okay others we are sleeping have you
[2:32:10] seen where we are one two three go
[2:32:12] if the seed of the woman was
[2:32:18] wait what does it mean
[2:32:22] one clever student
[2:32:26] yes what does it mean it means that
[2:32:29] it's the devil okay leave the if talk
[2:32:32] about the statement
[2:32:36] leave this if talk about the statement
[2:32:38] what was the seeded woman
[2:32:41] the seed of eve
[2:32:47] the seed of the woman that the bible
[2:32:48] speaks of in the book of genesis
[2:32:51] it's jesus but i wanted to explain this
[2:32:53] fact
[2:32:54] anyone who can do that
[2:32:58] what does it mean that the city of the
[2:32:59] woman was a man checked apart from the
[2:33:01] man
[2:33:02] what does it mean it means
[2:33:17] you see how you know people are born
[2:33:20] you know you have to have a daddy and
[2:33:23] mommy
[2:33:27] it's the same way we have children
[2:33:30] but it's not
[2:33:33] the seed of the woman will not be
[2:33:34] without would be without a
[2:33:37] physical meaning there would not be
[2:33:41] that there would be a child
[2:33:45] beautiful come here quickly huh come
[2:33:47] with the book give me the book
[2:33:52] there will be
[2:33:56] a woman you're not a woman you're a man
[2:33:59] of course
[2:33:59] but i'm just explaining that one time
[2:34:01] there would be a woman
[2:34:03] that would become pregnant
[2:34:06] with a child yet this child
[2:34:10] does not have
[2:34:14] a father from earth
[2:34:17] that is what it means the seed of the
[2:34:19] woman
[2:34:21] the seed of the woman would mean a child
[2:34:24] born
[2:34:26] without a man touching
[2:34:30] that is what it means a man child apart
[2:34:33] from
[2:34:36] meaning among child without money's
[2:34:39] innovation without sex
[2:34:43] then the seed of the serpent will have
[2:34:45] to be
[2:34:46] the same pattern what does it mean
[2:34:50] the seed of the serpent will also have
[2:34:53] to be
[2:34:54] without the let's dress the slope let's
[2:34:58] go slow
[2:34:59] you have to be a woman giving birth to a
[2:35:02] child
[2:35:04] but in this case also without a human
[2:35:08] male or father same pattern
[2:35:12] you're following me now yes
[2:35:17] are you telling me that cain was
[2:35:20] fathered by adam
[2:35:23] that means that cain for that father but
[2:35:26] not
[2:35:26] from this earth or i would rather say
[2:35:30] not a human male
[2:35:33] okay yes let us take it slower now
[2:35:36] and that is another male must be born
[2:35:39] apart from the human
[2:35:40] male instrumentality
[2:35:44] there is no student who does not know
[2:35:46] that the seed of the woman was the
[2:35:47] christ
[2:35:48] who came by the instrumentality of god
[2:35:53] okay apart from the human
[2:35:57] intercourse that is jesus came apart
[2:36:00] from without human intercourse
[2:36:02] it is also just as well known that they
[2:36:06] predicted the reason of the serpent is
[2:36:09] head
[2:36:09] was in the actuality of was an actuality
[2:36:13] a prophecy
[2:36:14] concerning what christ would accomplish
[2:36:16] against
[2:36:17] the cross
[2:36:21] when jesus went on the cross and by his
[2:36:23] death he bruised the head of the
[2:36:25] serpent there at the cross christ would
[2:36:29] grease the head of the saturn
[2:36:32] while saturn will break the hill
[2:36:37] you remember how he was pierced how they
[2:36:40] put
[2:36:40] even a nail in his legs and nailing his
[2:36:43] hands
[2:36:44] you know how they breached him but in
[2:36:46] the same way he also breached the head
[2:36:48] they raised the heel on him but he
[2:36:50] breathed
[2:36:53] he finished him once and for us now
[2:36:55] follow me
[2:36:59] god would have a baby without
[2:37:03] touching a woman
[2:37:06] okay yes you only spoke
[2:37:10] if i shout please
[2:37:13] take care don't worry i'm just feeling
[2:37:16] fire now in my heart i'll speak this
[2:37:19] mary had a baby in the stomach
[2:37:23] but the thing that gave her this baby
[2:37:27] was god how
[2:37:43] and she said what she said what
[2:37:49] he said what brother be it
[2:37:53] unto me according
[2:37:56] according to your word
[2:38:03] that is how it was supposed to be even
[2:38:04] in the beginning
[2:38:07] woman yes i just feel like having a baby
[2:38:11] brown eyes
[2:38:15] [Music]
[2:38:21] that's how we were supposed to be born
[2:38:23] but eventually we were born about it
[2:38:26] because of what the devil the serpent
[2:38:29] introduced
[2:38:30] the intercourse in the garden of eden
[2:38:33] but here god came to correct everything
[2:38:36] by
[2:38:37] jesus when he saw mary he spoke
[2:38:41] and his word created of the seed
[2:38:46] and his word created the egg
[2:38:49] in the womb of mary
[2:38:53] following now
[2:38:57] there was another woman hallelujah
[2:39:01] rather standard there
[2:39:04] was another woman i wish you'd be able
[2:39:05] to capture this you're not very active
[2:39:10] my hand right so
[2:39:14] this one is very fast i don't want to
[2:39:16] stand because
[2:39:17] i i i want people to see me and what i'm
[2:39:19] doing here
[2:39:21] and can you look this side can't decide
[2:39:23] yes thank you bro
[2:39:25] don't worry i don't want your face i
[2:39:26] don't want your stomach
[2:39:28] there was another another woman
[2:39:32] and this woman please can you follow me
[2:39:35] yes
[2:39:37] this one he only spoke a while and it
[2:39:40] happened
[2:39:42] when it came to another one this one was
[2:39:45] speaking
[2:39:46] who was speaking
[2:39:49] who was speaking it was
[2:39:53] god or the age of god
[2:39:57] it was god speaking let us say it was
[2:39:59] god
[2:40:01] because it came god came by the end
[2:40:02] right yes
[2:40:05] now so we noticed that
[2:40:09] this one god spoke and she became
[2:40:11] pregnant
[2:40:14] and and and she did not have a baby
[2:40:18] without a man ever touching her
[2:40:21] she just touched herself and
[2:40:25] realized that the baby was being formed
[2:40:28] but this one eve in the old testament
[2:40:32] at first was called a woman being a part
[2:40:34] of a man
[2:40:35] when the serpent came to her
[2:40:39] the serpent spoke like god spoke
[2:40:43] not so yes they suffered convinced
[2:40:47] eve the woman like
[2:40:50] god confessed
[2:40:55] like god wants to marry are you
[2:40:57] following
[2:40:58] me but here is the difference when god
[2:41:02] finished convincing me because
[2:41:04] she said i will need i will let it be
[2:41:06] then going to convince her more
[2:41:08] and he said the holy spirit will
[2:41:12] overshadow you she said amen
[2:41:16] are you following yes but when it came
[2:41:18] to men to eve
[2:41:21] when she said god said we should say
[2:41:24] don't worry
[2:41:25] and she was eventually there convinced
[2:41:35] excuse me if you tell me that
[2:41:39] mary i mean that if had a baby
[2:41:43] of the serpent like eve had a baby
[2:41:47] of mary it means that the serpent can
[2:41:50] create because remember
[2:41:53] only god is the word kind of creates he
[2:41:56] could only speak the word
[2:41:58] and and mary become pregnant
[2:42:01] but the devil could not speak only
[2:42:06] the word he spoke the word but his word
[2:42:10] was as powerless
[2:42:11] as the word of a eunuch
[2:42:15] amen do you know who are you not peace
[2:42:22] is a man who doesn't have sea
[2:42:25] who can have children so the devil's
[2:42:28] word is as far as as powerless as a word
[2:42:31] of a unit that's why never allow the
[2:42:33] devil to deceive
[2:42:34] you never allow the devil to deceive you
[2:42:37] because
[2:42:38] you see when it saves you you will die
[2:42:40] i'm telling you
[2:42:41] even your sisters don't allow those many
[2:42:44] without christ to deceive you and put
[2:42:45] you in shambles to put you in trouble
[2:42:47] they will deceive you but their words
[2:42:50] don't have life
[2:42:51] it's only the word of a son of god which
[2:42:53] has life
[2:42:54] are you hearing me let me tell you when
[2:42:57] a woman
[2:42:57] hears a word she is changed
[2:43:01] we have a linda agnes here i wonder if
[2:43:04] you can put on your video can you put on
[2:43:05] your video if you can
[2:43:06] i don't know whether she's at home what
[2:43:08] what but if you can put on your video
[2:43:10] i'll be happy because
[2:43:12] people will be able to see you
[2:43:14] hallelujah
[2:43:15] sister alinda was a
[2:43:19] you know a young a young maybe she may
[2:43:22] be waiting to hear what i'm going to say
[2:43:23] and then she will switch on her video
[2:43:27] but i know she's being a mother that she
[2:43:29] she might also be a bit busy
[2:43:31] with a baby i understand that but here's
[2:43:33] what i wanted to say
[2:43:35] uh whether or not she puts on a video i
[2:43:37] would still give a testimony
[2:43:39] sister alinda you know was in my house
[2:43:43] for years and years we even went to
[2:43:45] theater together
[2:43:46] for years and years yes i know you were
[2:43:48] hearing but i wanted the people to see
[2:43:50] you also
[2:43:51] and uh and so sister alinda
[2:43:54] eventually my little brother
[2:43:58] comes and speaks to her words of love
[2:44:03] what the what and when he spoke words of
[2:44:06] love to her
[2:44:42] is because
[2:44:58] the world will change change so sister
[2:45:00] so sister so sister so
[2:45:02] don't give don't give your ears ears
[2:45:05] gears
[2:45:06] to someone who has who has this gift
[2:45:09] let this be off okay so
[2:45:13] don't allow someone to give you words
[2:45:16] which are not coming from the right
[2:45:17] inspiration so we find that uh
[2:45:20] this brother here the devil comes
[2:45:25] to eve who is representing if the devil
[2:45:27] comes to eve
[2:45:28] and he gives her also want
[2:45:31] and she was changed meaning her mindset
[2:45:35] was changed
[2:45:36] and when her mind said god changed what
[2:45:37] happened
[2:45:39] she was ready to do whatever it is that
[2:45:41] she was she had to do
[2:45:43] just like mary mary was also ready
[2:45:46] but what did she act upon all was to do
[2:45:49] is to believe
[2:45:50] but if all was she was to do was to
[2:45:53] believe plus act
[2:45:57] plus do something if you love me why
[2:46:00] can't you do this see if you like my
[2:46:02] country ah
[2:46:02] you know those kind of things it is
[2:46:04] satanic right
[2:46:06] until you get the right man for you and
[2:46:08] your marriage
[2:46:10] now eve accepted her body to be touched
[2:46:14] yes and then she was able
[2:46:17] to yield to the desire of the devil
[2:46:21] and that's how she was able to get a
[2:46:23] child
[2:46:24] are you following me that is the
[2:46:27] difference between evil's story
[2:46:30] and mary's story both of them were
[2:46:31] virgins both of them
[2:46:34] when the word came to them and so
[2:46:38] i tell you the devil cannot be able to
[2:46:40] accomplish something
[2:46:42] in your life without ruining your life
[2:46:44] but god can accomplish something in your
[2:46:46] life
[2:46:47] without ruining it hallelujah
[2:46:51] you want god to accomplish something in
[2:46:52] your life you to him just
[2:46:54] accept believe it it will be done
[2:46:57] okay can we proceed and we see where to

[3:05:03] the it was planned over the planet with
[3:05:04] the planet with redemption it had
[3:05:06] planned the plan
[3:05:07] of the plan of the plan of islam of
[3:05:08] salaam observance
[3:05:10] requires salvation in order to give
[3:05:12] itself freedom and purpose of being
[3:05:14] that is one hundred percent correct
[3:05:17] announcements of scripture
[3:05:18] bear it out as does the very verse of
[3:05:22] romans 11 6
[3:05:23] 36 of him and through him
[3:05:27] and to give all things to whom be
[3:05:30] glory
[3:05:45] but before god could raise and save a
[3:05:48] sinner
[3:05:49] he had to have a sinner to raise and
[3:05:52] said
[3:05:53] man had to fall the whole which would be
[3:05:55] caused by satan
[3:05:56] had to have flesh to make fall
[3:06:00] saturn had to come through flesh also
[3:06:02] but satan would not
[3:06:04] come through my flesh to make the fall
[3:06:08] as christ coming human flesh to others
[3:06:12] but the other animal there's something
[3:06:15] so close to a man that certainly could
[3:06:17] get
[3:06:18] to that peace have you seen that part
[3:06:22] that saturn could not come in human
[3:06:24] flesh like jesus did to come and make
[3:06:26] the fall
[3:06:28] because it's not god it's only god who
[3:06:29] can do that
[3:06:35] but there was an animal something so
[3:06:38] close to man
[3:06:39] that certainly could get
[3:06:53] even as jesus would one day come and get
[3:06:56] himself
[3:06:57] to the human race human bodies even to
[3:07:00] the extent of the resurrection where
[3:07:03] we would have bodies like and choose
[3:07:07] that's what would work
[3:07:23] to the tree of life and i mean certainly
[3:07:25] not because in time
[3:07:27] but then anyway animal had caused the
[3:07:30] fall
[3:07:32] and it's not let's animalize
[3:07:35] the shade
[3:07:41] [Music]
[3:07:45] when god would appear in flesh and by
[3:07:48] means of his humiliation
[3:07:50] he would restore a fallen man and make
[3:07:52] him a particular of that life
[3:07:56] once you see this you can understand the
[3:07:58] stuff and see
[3:07:59] i know that it was no apple
[3:08:03] event no it was a degradation
[3:08:07] of humanity by international industry
[3:08:11] all right now i would like us to go to
[3:08:15] uh you can finish up that last beach the
[3:08:18] most important we have covered
[3:08:20] but i would like us to go a little bit
[3:08:21] down there and see and say
[3:08:23] and what did that reproduce the tree of
[3:08:25] knowledge produced death
[3:08:26] cain killed his brother aber the wicked
[3:08:28] killed the righteous
[3:08:30] it set a pattern it will keep that
[3:08:32] pattern until the restoration of
[3:08:34] all things are spoken by the prophets so
[3:08:36] the tree of knowledge produced clever
[3:08:38] men
[3:08:39] men of renown but their ways are the
[3:08:41] ways of death
[3:08:42] god's people are simple but spiritual
[3:08:45] minded leading to what god and nature
[3:08:47] calmly treating the soil
[3:08:49] caring the the the truth for the truth
[3:08:53] rather than wealth
[3:08:54] are you hearing the seed of the serpent
[3:08:57] has brought tremendous cameras wonderful
[3:09:00] intentions
[3:09:01] inventions rather but with it all comes
[3:09:03] death
[3:09:04] with it all comes death their gun power
[3:09:08] the atomic bombs this is the stuff that
[3:09:12] brought forth all these things and in
[3:09:15] peace
[3:09:15] time there are mechanical inventions
[3:09:18] such as the car
[3:09:19] they are killed even more in a time of
[3:09:21] peace than the
[3:09:23] the other invasions of war destroyed in
[3:09:24] times of trouble
[3:09:26] death and destruction are the fruits of
[3:09:29] halibuts
[3:09:31] but they are religious they believe in
[3:09:33] god they they are like their father the
[3:09:35] devil
[3:09:35] and their ancestor cain both of them
[3:09:38] believe in god
[3:09:39] they go to church they mingle with the
[3:09:41] righteous as do they tears mingle with
[3:09:42] the wheat
[3:09:43] in so doing they corrupt and produce a
[3:09:45] nicolaitan religion you see where it
[3:09:47] comes from
[3:09:49] they spread their poison in every effort
[3:09:51] to destroy the seed of god
[3:09:52] even as king killed abel there is no
[3:09:54] fear of god before their eyes
[3:09:56] but god loses none of his own i love
[3:09:58] that
[3:09:59] he keeps them even in death and has
[3:10:02] promised that
[3:10:03] in the last day he will raise them up
[3:10:06] hallelujah
[3:10:07] oh my praise the name of the lord amen
[3:10:10] he promised that in the last day
[3:10:11] he will raise them up you believe that
[3:10:14] hallelujah now i would like us to go to
[3:10:17] our conclusion and we bring this to our
[3:10:19] close
[3:10:21] i hope that you are not waiting oh when
[3:10:23] are we finishing this i just hope you
[3:10:25] are enjoying all through
[3:10:27] hallelujah to him that rava cometh will
[3:10:31] i give to eat of the tree of life which
[3:10:32] is in the midst of the paradise of god
[3:10:35] now what a thrilling thought as is this
[3:10:37] the tree of life is the garden of eden
[3:10:39] of course you have already seen
[3:10:41] the tree of life in the garden of eden
[3:10:45] which could not be approached andrew
[3:10:46] because of the fall of adam is now given
[3:10:49] to the over karma you remember i talked
[3:10:51] about that
[3:10:52] now we have access to the tree of life
[3:10:54] the flaming sort of the gardening
[3:10:55] cherubim
[3:10:56] has been sheathed uh
[3:10:59] but it was not stretched before its
[3:11:02] blade
[3:11:03] was bloody with the blood of the lamb
[3:11:06] you know meaning that that's what was
[3:11:08] out there
[3:11:09] waiting who it will destroy but now it
[3:11:12] has been
[3:11:13] shift it has been put back it has been
[3:11:15] kept meaning we shall not die or be
[3:11:18] killed if we access the tree of life
[3:11:20] we now have free access
[3:11:23] to the tree of life let us meditate upon
[3:11:27] this truth a while as we consider why
[3:11:29] the tree was denied of adam and his
[3:11:32] descendants but now
[3:11:33] allowed again and so
[3:11:37] we can now see that the tree of life
[3:11:39] which was rejected in the beginning
[3:11:43] we remember adam and eve was cast out
[3:11:45] now it is
[3:11:46] accepted and now it is not that we will
[3:11:49] die
[3:11:51] we shall actually leave even for a space
[3:11:54] of a thousand years
[3:11:57] a millennium why do you think we can be
[3:11:59] able to live for a millennium one
[3:12:00] thousand days when even adam never made
[3:12:02] it
[3:12:03] when even methuselah never made it
[3:12:06] it is because the the sword has been
[3:12:09] shift
[3:12:11] has been kept away we now have access
[3:12:14] amen you know uh that is the most
[3:12:18] interesting thing why we are believing
[3:12:20] this message
[3:12:21] right now what are you doing you are
[3:12:23] eating the tree of life
[3:12:25] you are eating until the body becomes so
[3:12:28] tired
[3:12:30] but the spirit still eats and
[3:12:33] one of these days when we are going to
[3:12:36] our reward
[3:12:37] others will be like what can i do also
[3:12:39] so i can also get what you have
[3:12:40] but there's nothing you can do i've been
[3:12:42] eating for many years
[3:12:44] how can you eat for all those years in
[3:12:46] one day it
[3:12:47] can't happen so those who have been
[3:12:49] missing this
[3:12:51] it is it is going to be they're going to
[3:12:53] be so sorry they missed it
[3:12:55] you is receiving it now you will be so
[3:12:59] happy that you spent your time
[3:13:01] everything else does not have value the
[3:13:04] only thing that holds value is christ
[3:13:06] and his word
[3:13:07] christ and is what i tell you when you
[3:13:09] begin to see the
[3:13:10] the things of the world in the light of
[3:13:12] the world you are like come to think of
[3:13:14] it
[3:13:15] what what really holds value what really
[3:13:18] is important
[3:13:19] nothing but christ because whatever it
[3:13:22] is that you are getting that is
[3:13:23] spiritual for your spirit for your soul
[3:13:25] is what you will leave this world with
[3:13:27] and the way you leave the world is the
[3:13:29] way you will
[3:13:30] you remain don't ever think that when
[3:13:32] you go there because there's another
[3:13:33] world though together you will now be
[3:13:35] chained and be a good man no
[3:13:37] if you are bad here you are bad there if
[3:13:39] you're good here you're about if you're
[3:13:40] a politician here you are petitioned
[3:13:41] there
[3:13:42] if you're a mother right here you are
[3:13:43] mother if you're a footballer your
[3:13:44] footballer there
[3:13:46] whatever you were yeah here you were
[3:13:47] there so now don't even think that you
[3:13:50] will die and you'll become a better man
[3:13:52] if he was up and said yeah you're
[3:13:53] supposed to sit there if you're a seed
[3:13:55] of god here you're a seed of god there
[3:13:56] if you are stabbed here yourself there
[3:13:58] if you are changing the year you are
[3:13:59] changed there if you are reasoning here
[3:14:01] you are reasoning there
[3:14:03] if you love god here you love god there
[3:14:05] whatever you die
[3:14:06] in the condition you are in you will
[3:14:08] remain don't ever think for a moment
[3:14:10] that your condition will change when you
[3:14:12] die death doesn't change your condition
[3:14:14] death only changes the place where you
[3:14:15] go
[3:14:17] you see so friends it's
[3:14:20] not in vain it's not
[3:14:24] in vain and it concludes all this by
[3:14:27] saying
[3:14:28] he that has an ear let him hear what the
[3:14:30] spirit says unto
[3:14:32] the churches hallelujah and then it says
[3:14:35] how tragic
[3:14:36] it is that this first age did not
[3:14:41] listen to the spirit instead it listened
[3:14:43] to a man
[3:14:45] but thank god in the last age there will
[3:14:47] be a group riser
[3:14:49] are you in that number the true bride of
[3:14:53] the last day and she will listen to the
[3:14:55] spirit
[3:14:56] in that day of gross darkness the light
[3:14:59] will return by the pure world and we
[3:15:00] will and
[3:15:01] we will return to this power of
[3:15:04] pentecost will come back the lord
