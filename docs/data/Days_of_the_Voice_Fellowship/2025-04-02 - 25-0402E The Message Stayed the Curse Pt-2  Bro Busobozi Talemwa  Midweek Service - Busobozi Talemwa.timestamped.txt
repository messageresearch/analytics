[56:20] sister
[56:21] Martha who is going to be traveling for
[56:24] another
[56:26] barrier. Lord, we ask your protection
[56:28] upon her.
[56:30] Father, as you be traveling and in going
[56:33] and in coming
[56:34] back, may your holy angels watch over
[56:37] her,
[56:38] God. And Lord, we want to commit this
[56:40] session of your
[56:43] word. Energize us
[56:45] Lord and use us Lord to speak your word
[56:48] to your
[56:50] people. Not just your vessels
[56:53] Lord. Use us Father. We ask this
[56:56] blessing in Jesus
[56:57] name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Please be
[57:02] seated. Um as usual I'm going to request
[57:04] those that I can't see or that can't see
[57:06] me to please come and sit this side.
[57:14] uh you know we we this place when we
[57:16] build our church we will not put those

[57:28] so some people like sitting in places
[57:33] where you have to do like this
[57:37] for uh it's always good when you sit
[57:39] where the preacher can
[57:43] Amen.
[57:45] Praise the
[57:46] Lord. Has the Lord been good to
[57:49] you? We had a good service also
[57:53] in last Sunday
[57:57] afternoon. A really good meeting with
[57:59] the saints
[58:01] there. Also, of course, you know that
[58:04] the place where we fellowship there is a
[58:06] at a
[58:08] school. So we we the believers gather
[58:13] there on Thursday
[58:15] evening and also on Sunday uh we we go
[58:20] there every
[58:22] evening. So it is usually after school
[58:26] hours we gather in their main
[58:29] hall. So the students usually join both
[58:32] those
[58:35] services and uh brother Julius actually
[58:39] told me the other day that I think about
[58:41] two
[58:43] students how many wanted to be baptized.
[58:47] Yeah. Few
[58:49] students uh are already ready for
[58:53] baptism. So the Lord is already doing
[58:57] something. So we um we we had a good
[59:02] service
[59:03] and afterwards we went to um um uh the
[59:07] brother's
[59:11] house is you know they were here we
[59:14] introduced them to
[59:16] you brother Emma and his wife sister
[59:19] Sarah and um because they had gone to a
[59:22] new house they wanted us to come and
[59:24] pray there
[59:27] and so We we really had a good
[59:30] time also other believers came and
[59:32] joined
[59:34] us. So we we had a good
[59:38] fellowship and a good swall as
[59:43] well. Sorry you missed
[59:45] that but uh it was a good time
[59:50] in then afterwards we traveled. So I was
[59:53] really dead in the evening.
[59:59] So the whole of Monday I was also just
[1:00:01] crawling. I was very
[1:00:04] tired. But I figure we have to serve God
[1:00:07] when we are still young and
[1:00:11] strong. As you grow, you realize that
[1:00:13] the body gets tired quicker.
[1:00:19] But by God's grace as he gives us grace,
[1:00:21] strength in a
[1:00:23] body, we are yet to serve him more for
[1:00:26] more
[1:00:28] years. 30 more years, 40 more
[1:00:31] years, we'll preach this message. If the
[1:00:34] Lord tries, we are
[1:00:36] preach. So the devil should get
[1:00:39] ready. We are still
[1:00:42] here. If the Lord tries, we will we are
[1:00:46] going to preach more years.
[1:00:49] And uh you know uh as you know I travel
[1:00:52] a
[1:00:52] lot. So when I'm here I want to give you
[1:00:56] as much as I
[1:00:58] can and when I travel then the other
[1:01:01] brothers can be able to also
[1:01:06] minister. Yeah. Sometimes
[1:01:09] um I I have things on my heart that I
[1:01:11] really feel that the church should you
[1:01:12] know we should share with the church.
[1:01:18] Uh but don't make a mistake. I always
[1:01:20] love also to sit down and be ministered
[1:01:25] to. There are some preachers who don't
[1:01:27] like to be preached
[1:01:31] too. So but me I love
[1:01:35] it. I just I believe every preacher
[1:01:38] needs to be preached
[1:01:41] to. And whenever you hear others preach,
[1:01:44] you you you are
[1:01:47] revived. I was revived on uh on on
[1:01:50] Friday
[1:01:52] night. Brother Julius and brother
[1:01:55] preached
[1:01:57] good. Those who did not come on Friday,
[1:02:00] you missed brother Pol's sermon.
[1:02:04] It was quite an
[1:02:07] amazing amazing message.
[1:02:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:13] So this evening, I just want to continue
[1:02:14] with what we shared on
[1:02:18] Sunday. Maybe taking a few corners there
[1:02:20] and here and
[1:02:22] there. Uh the message stayed the
[1:02:27] curse. The message stayed the
[1:02:30] curse. Aina. Amen. So that I take it
[1:02:34] from uh vers
[1:02:37] six which in verse one verse five he
[1:02:40] says behold I'll send you Elijah the
[1:02:42] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:02:43] and the dreadful day of the
[1:02:47] lord and he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:02:50] fathers of the
[1:02:53] children and the heart of the children
[1:02:55] to their
[1:02:57] fathers lest I come and smite the earth
[1:03:00] with a curse.
[1:03:03] If you notice in the book of Malachi
[1:03:05] chapter
[1:03:07] 3, he's speaking about another
[1:03:11] messenger. And please put on your
[1:03:13] spiritual thinking caps because this you
[1:03:14] need to understand these
[1:03:18] things. In verses one of chapter
[1:03:22] 3, he says, "Behold, I'll send my
[1:03:24] messenger and he shall prepare the way
[1:03:26] before
[1:03:28] me. And the Lord whom ye seek shall
[1:03:31] suddenly come to his
[1:03:33] temple, even the messenger of the
[1:03:36] covenant, whom ye delight in, behold, he
[1:03:40] shall come, sayith the Lord of hosts. So
[1:03:44] you see those words mean different
[1:03:46] things. So when he says, I will send.
[1:03:49] Who is speaking? God is
[1:03:53] speaking. My messenger, which
[1:03:56] messenger? This is the messenger who was
[1:03:58] going to come before the Lord comes to
[1:04:00] the
[1:04:00] [Music]
[1:04:02] earth before the first coming of
[1:04:05] Jesus. And then he says he shall prepare
[1:04:07] the way before
[1:04:09] me. So this messenger was supposed to
[1:04:12] prepare the way before the Lord is
[1:04:16] coming. And then the Lord whom you
[1:04:19] seek of course here is speaking to the
[1:04:22] Jews. They were they were already
[1:04:24] worshiping God for many years.
[1:04:28] in the temple with the temple. But then
[1:04:30] here he says the Lord whom you
[1:04:33] seek shall suddenly come into his
[1:04:37] temple. But you see here he is speaking
[1:04:40] about John the
[1:04:43] Baptist coming to prepare the way before
[1:04:46] the coming the first coming of
[1:04:50] Jesus. And when John the Baptist
[1:04:53] comes, then the Lord will come in his
[1:04:56] name. So who is the Lord? The God of the
[1:05:00] Old Testament, the Jehovah of the Old
[1:05:03] Testament. He says, "I am the Lord. That
[1:05:06] is my name and my I will not give my
[1:05:09] praise to any graven image or my
[1:05:13] glory." So he cannot share his lordship
[1:05:16] with anyone.
[1:05:19] There is only one
[1:05:21] Lord, one faith and one baptism here. O
[1:05:26] Israel, the Lord, your
[1:05:29] God is one
[1:05:31] Lord. So you see is one God. There are
[1:05:35] not two or three gods. There is only one
[1:05:38] God. The creator of heaven and earth.
[1:05:42] Now the creator of heaven and earth was
[1:05:45] going to come in a body of
[1:05:47] flesh. He created a
[1:05:50] temple so that he may come in the
[1:05:53] temple. And he even gave a prophecy by
[1:05:56] the lips of
[1:05:59] Malachi that the Lord is coming in his
[1:06:02] temple. But they did not understand
[1:06:05] because they thought he was talking
[1:06:07] about the temple of
[1:06:09] Solomon. But they did not understand. He
[1:06:11] was talking about his own
[1:06:14] body. The body he had
[1:06:17] created. He was talking about
[1:06:20] Jesus. Jesus is the
[1:06:23] temple and God is a
[1:06:25] spirit. So God the
[1:06:27] spirit came in Jesus the
[1:06:30] body. And so Jesus was the temple of
[1:06:34] God. and and and you know the God they
[1:06:37] were waiting
[1:06:39] for was now walking in
[1:06:42] Jesus on earth. And when they saw
[1:06:46] Jesus, they refused to believe him
[1:06:49] because they refused to believe
[1:06:51] John, they did not understand when God
[1:06:54] came in
[1:06:56] Jesus. And because they refused to
[1:06:58] believe in
[1:07:00] Jesus, they were cast.
[1:07:03] [Music]
[1:07:05] He they looked at him and they said,
[1:07:09] "Oh, who are
[1:07:11] you?" They said, "You are just a son of
[1:07:14] Mary, son of
[1:07:15] Joseph. You were even born out of
[1:07:17] wedlock."
[1:07:21] illegitimate
[1:07:22] child. They thought he was, but they
[1:07:26] never
[1:07:27] understood this is the
[1:07:29] creator of heaven and earth. He has come
[1:07:33] down on earth.
[1:07:34] The Bible says he came among his
[1:07:37] own, but his own received him
[1:07:40] not. He was the light that shines in the
[1:07:45] world. But when Amen. when he came to
[1:07:47] shine in the world, they love the
[1:07:50] darkness more than the light.
[1:07:54] are the they the Pharisees and the
[1:07:58] Sadducees, the ones that had spent a
[1:08:01] long time rehearsing the scriptures of
[1:08:03] the
[1:08:06] law. They had spent a long
[1:08:08] time talking about, you know, God and
[1:08:11] about Jesus
[1:08:13] coming. They believed in the
[1:08:16] Messiah. By the way, they believed in
[1:08:18] the
[1:08:19] Messiah. They would read
[1:08:21] scriptures like in Isaiah, "Unto us a
[1:08:26] child is born, unto us a son is given,
[1:08:30] the government shall be upon his
[1:08:32] shoulders." They read the
[1:08:35] scriptures. They read scriptures about,
[1:08:37] you know, a virgin shall
[1:08:41] conceive and have a
[1:08:43] son. They read these scriptures. They
[1:08:46] knew and they rehearsed it over and
[1:08:48] over.
[1:08:50] But when Jesus came to them, they
[1:08:52] rejected him like
[1:08:55] devils and they said, "Who do you think
[1:08:57] you are? You you are you have a demon in
[1:09:02] you." Because the way you are
[1:09:06] talking, you look like you have
[1:09:08] demons. If people who kept the
[1:09:12] law, people who told the
[1:09:15] law that Jesus was demonp possessed,
[1:09:20] It means he must have been so
[1:09:21] controversial to
[1:09:24] them. They believed in the coming of the
[1:09:28] Messiah but they never believed in this
[1:09:32] Messiah. So their
[1:09:34] messiah they had in their head they had
[1:09:38] in their theology was different from the
[1:09:41] Messiah of the
[1:09:45] prophecy. And today they still reject
[1:09:48] the
[1:09:49] Messiah. They still reject the Jesus.
[1:09:53] The Jesus the denominations
[1:09:56] worship is different from the Jesus of
[1:09:59] the Bible.
[1:10:01] And I can prove
[1:10:03] that because they rejected Elijah the
[1:10:06] prophet because they reject the the one
[1:10:09] that would reveal
[1:10:12] him, the one that prepares the way
[1:10:14] before him.
[1:10:16] They cannot understand him when he
[1:10:19] come. You cannot understand
[1:10:23] Jesus. You cannot believe Jesus if you
[1:10:26] fail to believe the messenger who has
[1:10:29] been sent to prepare the way before
[1:10:35] him because they never understood
[1:10:38] John. When they saw John, they said,
[1:10:41] "What's wrong with you?
[1:10:46] They didn't
[1:10:47] understand. You know, John was a son of
[1:10:50] a
[1:10:51] priest. These things are so
[1:10:54] interesting. Go God is a very good movie
[1:10:58] actor. He he he sets scenes that are
[1:11:01] very
[1:11:03] interesting. See here that he he
[1:11:06] prepared a
[1:11:08] priest. A priest who actually never
[1:11:10] believed in him.
[1:11:13] What was his name again?
[1:11:16] Zechariah. Zakaria. You're good Bible
[1:11:18] readers.
[1:11:20] And Zakar
[1:11:21] Zakarias when the angel came to him and
[1:11:24] brought the
[1:11:25] news. You have a special child. You're
[1:11:28] going to give birth. What are you
[1:11:30] talking about? I'm very busy with my
[1:11:32] work and you study. Which work was he
[1:11:36] doing that you were serving
[1:11:39] God? Don't be busy. Don't be so busy to
[1:11:42] serve God until you fail to see God when
[1:11:44] he comes to you.
[1:11:54] Whenever we go to the mission
[1:11:56] fields and we are preaching the gospel,
[1:11:59] many preachers tell us, "Why are you
[1:12:02] preaching to me? Preach to the sinners
[1:12:05] on the streets."
[1:12:07] Oh, let me tell you brethren, we are
[1:12:09] going to preach and we are preaching to
[1:12:10] the sinners on the
[1:12:12] streets. But the end time message which
[1:12:15] we
[1:12:16] have is even not for only the sinners on
[1:12:19] the
[1:12:20] streets. This is for preachers on the
[1:12:24] pulpit. This is for church
[1:12:27] goers, church members, those who think
[1:12:31] they believe in
[1:12:32] Jesus. This is where this level of this
[1:12:35] message is.
[1:12:39] The message is like
[1:12:42] university. They are like as if they are
[1:12:44] in primary
[1:12:47] section. So we have to upgrade
[1:12:50] them. God in every generation has been
[1:12:54] upgrading his
[1:12:55] people. He says let us leave the
[1:12:58] foundations of baptisms and faith and
[1:13:00] these things and let us go on to
[1:13:02] perfection.
[1:13:08] The message is not a
[1:13:10] foundation. The message is a climaxing
[1:13:12] of the whole
[1:13:14] thing. The message is the climax of the
[1:13:17] entire body of
[1:13:20] Christ. Let me put it this way. We are
[1:13:23] not the alpha
[1:13:27] bride. We are the omega bride.
[1:13:32] We are not the alpha
[1:13:34] church. We are the omega
[1:13:37] church. So we we are not right here at
[1:13:40] the
[1:13:41] beginning. We are at the
[1:13:43] end. That's why it is called an end time
[1:13:49] message. So now we need to
[1:13:51] understand the message which we have
[1:13:54] cannot be understood by those who
[1:13:56] despise the messenger that God has sent.
[1:14:02] [Music]
[1:14:03] And if you think we are the same like
[1:14:05] Miracle Center, you are lost
[1:14:10] because you see we sing the songs that
[1:14:12] Felero sings and you think we are the
[1:14:13] same. You don't know what you're talking
[1:14:19] about. This message is more than any
[1:14:21] other
[1:14:23] denomination. It is the highest
[1:14:26] revelation in this hour.
[1:14:29] That's why we cannot be among
[1:14:31] them. This message is come out from
[1:14:34] among
[1:14:35] them. Be ye separate. So this message is
[1:14:39] a calling
[1:14:41] out. Amen. We are right in this
[1:14:45] exodus in the third
[1:14:48] exodus where we are being called out of
[1:14:50] the
[1:14:51] denomination. Come out from my people
[1:14:55] and we have come out. And so here
[1:14:58] Zakarius as he was busy he never
[1:15:02] understood what God was
[1:15:04] doing. And so what happened? He was
[1:15:10] cast. This message we are dealing with
[1:15:14] is a serious message. Any man who
[1:15:16] refuses it will be cast.
[1:15:21] You know Jesus said when you go to a
[1:15:23] town and you are refused shake off your
[1:15:27] the dust off your feet meaning cast
[1:15:31] them. Yes sir. Who had the authority to
[1:15:34] do
[1:15:35] that? Only the man who had that say the
[1:15:39] Lord. Only he that was
[1:15:42] sent. Not everyone was sent. Others are
[1:15:46] preaching because they are believing the
[1:15:48] one who was sent.
[1:15:51] But I'm talking about the one who was
[1:15:53] saved. The apostles were the ones with
[1:15:56] the right to do
[1:15:58] that because they were sent. Paul was
[1:16:01] the messenger of the first
[1:16:03] age. He could do that because he was
[1:16:06] sent. He was sent to the
[1:16:09] Gentiles. He was the messenger of the
[1:16:11] first church
[1:16:13] age. So he could cast those who refused
[1:16:16] to believe his message.
[1:16:18] And now we see in the same same
[1:16:21] way that when he the angel came
[1:16:25] down with a message that my messenger is
[1:16:29] coming Zakaria refused to
[1:16:32] believe he was
[1:16:34] dumbfounded. No you will no longer talk.
[1:16:37] Meaning anyone who doesn't believe this
[1:16:40] message he has no right to
[1:16:45] talk. Amen. You have no right to listen
[1:16:48] to
[1:16:50] them. Come out from among
[1:16:53] them. These messages are coming
[1:16:55] out and are going into the
[1:16:59] rapture. And then we see later on you
[1:17:04] know the angel went to the woman
[1:17:07] Elizabeth. This was a priest but he
[1:17:10] failed to
[1:17:11] understand. The religious people are the
[1:17:13] most confused.
[1:17:16] But God always reveals himself to the
[1:17:20] humble such as can
[1:17:23] learn. Are you humble enough to
[1:17:26] learn? Are you willing to learn?
[1:17:31] Amen. And and and and you know when when
[1:17:34] John the Baptist was
[1:17:36] born, you know, after a little
[1:17:38] while, he went to the wild, he became a
[1:17:42] wild
[1:17:43] man. And everybody was speaking
[1:17:46] perhaps that you see this uh the the
[1:17:49] priest's boy went to the
[1:17:52] wild. He he got
[1:17:55] spoiled. Maybe he's taking weed. Who
[1:17:59] knows? Because by the time he came out
[1:18:01] of the
[1:18:02] wild, he was
[1:18:05] looking with all the
[1:18:09] dreadlocks. Don't use dreadlocks because
[1:18:12] John had dreadlocks.
[1:18:16] You are not
[1:18:18] John. Yes, you are. You have to
[1:18:21] understand God will do what he wants to
[1:18:23] do when he wants to do
[1:18:27] it. Hallelujah. Amen. That a believer
[1:18:30] must
[1:18:32] know. And so we see he came out with
[1:18:35] dreadlocks, you know, with all the the
[1:18:37] teared clothes.
[1:18:40] And then he began, you know, he was
[1:18:41] eating wild honey.
[1:18:44] a
[1:18:45] locust. And by the time he came out, he
[1:18:48] he came out, you know, uh with maybe red
[1:18:50] eyes, who
[1:18:52] knows?
[1:18:53] Repent. This was a message like has
[1:18:56] never been heard
[1:18:58] before. But you know, it was not a
[1:19:01] message from nowhere.
[1:19:04] It was by for people who knew the
[1:19:08] prophecies and who had spiritual eyes to
[1:19:11] discern what God was
[1:19:14] saying understood who John
[1:19:17] was. And when he said
[1:19:19] repent, he repent you people. People
[1:19:23] believed. Of course, some believe. Not
[1:19:26] everyone believed. We see in Acts
[1:19:28] chapter 12, Acts chapter 19.
[1:19:31] some people about 12 of them who had
[1:19:34] believed and were following
[1:19:37] John. And there were several others who
[1:19:39] believed. The Bible says John had
[1:19:42] disciples. So they
[1:19:44] believed. Amen. There will be believers
[1:19:47] in every
[1:19:48] age. And the believers their eyes will
[1:19:51] be open. The believers they will be
[1:19:54] blessed. The believers they will be
[1:19:57] under a special anointing of the season.
[1:20:03] But there was another
[1:20:06] group. This was the biggest group. They
[1:20:10] had the biggest
[1:20:11] churches. They had the best music. They
[1:20:15] had better preachers. They had better
[1:20:18] clothes. They were called Pharisees
[1:20:21] and when they came to John, they never
[1:20:24] believed
[1:20:25] John asked him questions to trap
[1:20:28] him. But John was
[1:20:31] anointed. John knew the
[1:20:34] scriptures. Amen. If you are true
[1:20:37] servant of God, you will always know the
[1:20:40] scriptures and fulfill
[1:20:43] them. Amen. But only God knows how to
[1:20:47] package his
[1:20:49] servants in such a way that he will
[1:20:51] always offend those who are not meant to
[1:20:53] believe.
[1:21:00] That's why in in the message of the
[1:21:02] hour, brother says many
[1:21:05] things. Some of them you can even
[1:21:07] stumble on
[1:21:09] them. But you know, God allowed him to
[1:21:12] say that way to shake off the
[1:21:18] unbelievers. And then he says, I
[1:21:21] predict, I do not prophesy, but I
[1:21:25] predict
[1:21:27] 1977 will bring the end of world
[1:21:31] systems. And then now people will begin
[1:21:33] to say, "Ah, he prophesied the end of
[1:21:35] the world." So for us, we don't believe
[1:21:37] him. He's a false prophet. Don't you
[1:21:40] worry. That was for you to shake you
[1:21:45] off. There are many other things he's
[1:21:48] saying.
[1:21:49] said, "A woman who has allowed herself
[1:21:51] to be used by the
[1:21:54] devil going into immorality and they
[1:21:57] have made her a sex garbage can." And
[1:22:00] now when you hear such a
[1:22:07] thing and that's what Hollywood has
[1:22:10] done, that's what the systems of the
[1:22:12] world have done to a woman.
[1:22:15] They have made a lustful
[1:22:17] object with all
[1:22:19] these evil videos and
[1:22:22] things. You know what? When you hear
[1:22:25] such
[1:22:26] phrases, they get offended. They say
[1:22:29] he's abusing a woman and they walk away.
[1:22:33] But for you, sister and brother, you
[1:22:36] will say that is nothing but the
[1:22:39] truth. They are offended and they call
[1:22:42] it heresy. But the way that is called
[1:22:46] heresy, worshipy the God of my
[1:22:51] father. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise the
[1:22:54] name of the Lord. And so that is the
[1:22:57] message. And so John came and they asked
[1:23:00] him religious people. They said let us
[1:23:04] go and prove to him he is
[1:23:07] nothing. They say they asked him a
[1:23:11] question. Are you that
[1:23:13] prophet? He said
[1:23:15] no. Okay. Are you
[1:23:18] Elijah? He said
[1:23:23] no. We thought we would trap
[1:23:26] him. So who are
[1:23:29] you? He said, "Praise the
[1:23:33] Lord." And then he began quoting the
[1:23:37] prophecy like a
[1:23:40] typewriter.
[1:23:41] Listen, John maybe had never read that
[1:23:47] prophecy. He never went to their
[1:23:50] schools. He never read the
[1:23:52] scrolls. He was in the bush. But he
[1:23:55] quoted it word for
[1:23:57] word. I am the voice of him crying from
[1:24:03] the wilderness. Prepare ye the way of
[1:24:05] the
[1:24:06] Lord. Make his path
[1:24:09] straight. And they got
[1:24:11] confused. But that's prophecy. That's
[1:24:14] scripture. That's whatever. That's
[1:24:17] whatever. But what John had said that
[1:24:19] said he could not take
[1:24:22] back did they believe him? No. They
[1:24:27] didn't believe him. And when the Messiah
[1:24:29] came, the same people who refused to
[1:24:32] believe
[1:24:33] John, their eyes were closed to who the
[1:24:36] Messiah was.
[1:24:40] when they refused to believe the
[1:24:42] [Music]
[1:24:44] message who had come to prepare the
[1:24:47] coming of the
[1:24:49] Lord. They were cast. They could no
[1:24:53] longer see the
[1:24:54] Lord. Their eyes were
[1:24:57] blinded and the Lord came. The Lord of
[1:25:00] glory. The one who created heaven and
[1:25:03] earth. The one who gave the law. He came
[1:25:07] and stood before
[1:25:10] them and they told him, "You above the
[1:25:15] book and then they will go back and they
[1:25:18] read and ask a son is
[1:25:23] given such
[1:25:25] blindness and they come back to him. You
[1:25:28] are
[1:25:32] blinded. They were cast because they
[1:25:35] refused to believe the
[1:25:38] messenger. Okay, let me come to today.
[1:25:42] If they don't believe the
[1:25:44] messenger, they can never see
[1:25:47] Jesus. Jesus is the word. They claim to
[1:25:51] believe Jesus. They claim to have Jesus,
[1:25:55] claim to sing for Jesus. No, they don't.
[1:25:59] They don't know him. Even the one they
[1:26:02] are singing about is not the one that
[1:26:05] actually
[1:26:06] is. That's why some of the songs they
[1:26:09] sing, we grab it from them because we
[1:26:12] are the right people supposed to
[1:26:15] sing. They can't understand what they're
[1:26:17] talking
[1:26:18] about. Hallelujah. Redeemed. How I love
[1:26:21] to
[1:26:23] proclaim. Who are you? Are you redeemed
[1:26:27] in your anglicism and
[1:26:30] Catholicism? No, you are not. But who is
[1:26:33] redeemed? He that has received the
[1:26:35] present truth, the
[1:26:39] word. So we take those songs and we
[1:26:42] begin singing them. And when we sing
[1:26:44] them, the anointing comes upon us and
[1:26:48] breaks the yoke. Why? Because it's not
[1:26:51] about the song. is about the singer of
[1:26:54] the
[1:26:56] song. Amen.
[1:26:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:27:02] Hallelujah. The message stay the
[1:27:05] cast. It's only the messenger's
[1:27:09] message which can stay the
[1:27:12] cast. Elijah's
[1:27:14] ministry is not a simple
[1:27:17] ministry. If you believe it, believe it.
[1:27:19] If you don't, leave it.
[1:27:22] And even if you're planning to walk away
[1:27:24] from the
[1:27:25] message, walk away
[1:27:28] silently. Don't talk anything
[1:27:30] evil because if you do, I'm telling you,
[1:27:34] you are in
[1:27:35] danger. This message is a powerp packed
[1:27:41] message. It is a message packed with
[1:27:44] blessings and backed with curses.
[1:27:51] Yes sir.
[1:27:53] The Bible in the book of Malachi said,
[1:27:56] "I'll send my
[1:27:58] messenger Elijah the prophet before the
[1:28:01] great and the dreadful of the
[1:28:03] Lord." The great day of the
[1:28:06] Lord was the first coming of
[1:28:09] Jesus and John was the messenger. The
[1:28:12] dreadful day of the Lord has not yet
[1:28:16] happened. It is the second coming of
[1:28:18] Jesus.
[1:28:20] And we are waiting for it. But the Bible
[1:28:23] here is saying before the coming of the
[1:28:26] great
[1:28:28] day and before the coming of the
[1:28:30] dreadful
[1:28:31] day, I will send Elijah the
[1:28:35] prophet. And what shall he
[1:28:37] do before the great
[1:28:40] day? Before the first coming of
[1:28:42] Jesus, he will turn the heart of the
[1:28:45] fathers to the children.
[1:28:49] the fathers, the fathers of the
[1:28:51] law, the the Old Testament
[1:28:55] people, the Pharisees, their hearts, we
[1:29:00] are turn to
[1:29:03] grace that is fathers to
[1:29:07] children. But you see, there's another
[1:29:10] portion which was never fulfilled.
[1:29:14] This is for our
[1:29:15] time and the heart of the
[1:29:19] children to the fathers.
[1:29:22] Amen. Amen. We are the children of
[1:29:25] God. We are received the spirit of
[1:29:29] God. So we are the children of this
[1:29:32] generation. But you see the hearts of
[1:29:36] the
[1:29:37] children in many denominations in the
[1:29:39] end
[1:29:41] time they are lost in wrong
[1:29:45] doctrine. So Elijah the prophet must
[1:29:49] come and when he comes his message will
[1:29:53] turn their
[1:29:55] hearts to the Pentecostal fathers.
[1:30:03] Amen. And so now we are the children.
[1:30:07] Our hearts must be
[1:30:08] turned back to the faith of the
[1:30:11] fathers, back to the favor of the faith
[1:30:14] of the
[1:30:15] apostles, back to the original faith,
[1:30:18] back to the Bible. You see this Elijah
[1:30:21] ministry is not bringing anything
[1:30:25] new. It is bringing that which was there
[1:30:28] already.
[1:30:31] [Music]
[1:30:33] Elijah is come. Tell your neighbor
[1:30:35] Elijah is
[1:30:36] come. Our hearts have been
[1:30:40] turned. Amen.
[1:30:43] All right. Give me that picture,
[1:30:45] brother. If you
[1:30:46] have brother Isaac will, if you can put
[1:30:49] up that picture, that yellow picture,
[1:30:51] that' be wonderful. Do we have it over
[1:30:54] here, brother Marvin? I know I did not
[1:30:56] give you a warning, but I told you to
[1:30:57] make it ready. if you don't have it or
[1:30:59] just leave it and continue. Praise the
[1:31:01] name of the
[1:31:02] Lord. And so we look over here in the
[1:31:04] book of Colossians chapter
[1:31:06] one vers uh
[1:31:11] six as the brother is putting up the
[1:31:23] picture uh 6.
[1:31:26] And before we read that
[1:31:28] You can see here on this picture, Elijah
[1:31:31] comes five
[1:31:33] times the first coming of
[1:31:35] Elijah. First Kings
[1:31:38] 17:1, Elijah
[1:31:40] the one who caught fire from heaven.
[1:31:43] That was the first man called Elijah.
[1:31:45] But God uses the spirit which was upon
[1:31:49] him four more times. And we see it comes
[1:31:52] upon a man called Elisha.
[1:31:55] Second Kings
[1:31:57] 2:1, he replicated the ministry of
[1:32:01] Elijah in a double portion. God now in
[1:32:05] Malachi
[1:32:06] 4 at the end of the Old
[1:32:09] Testament, he pro he promises to use the
[1:32:13] spirit of Elijah
[1:32:15] again. But if we
[1:32:17] say, listen carefully, if we say that
[1:32:22] this Elijah will not come to the
[1:32:23] Gentiles, but only to the
[1:32:27] Jews, we do not believe in the grace of
[1:32:31] God. We do not believe in the power and
[1:32:34] the work of the
[1:32:37] cross because the Messiah was not
[1:32:40] ours. He didn't come to us. But by
[1:32:43] grace, by election, by for the Messiah
[1:32:48] came to the
[1:32:49] Gentiles. So because of that, this
[1:32:52] prophecy in Malachi
[1:32:54] 4 has a double effect to
[1:32:57] it, it speaks about John. But in that
[1:33:01] last
[1:33:02] part, it speaks about an Elijah coming
[1:33:05] to the
[1:33:08] Gentiles before the second coming of
[1:33:10] Jesus.
[1:33:12] But
[1:33:13] also he is speaking about the Elijah who
[1:33:16] is coming to the
[1:33:19] Jews after the
[1:33:22] rapture. The Bible in the book of
[1:33:25] revelation also speaks about
[1:33:27] them in revelation 3 11
[1:33:31] rather he speaks about the two
[1:33:34] witnesses that's the fifth coming of the
[1:33:37] spirit of
[1:33:39] Elijah. So that is coming
[1:33:42] too. But we don't want to talk about
[1:33:45] that because that is after the
[1:33:49] rapture. We don't want to talk about
[1:33:52] this because John already
[1:33:54] came. But we want to
[1:33:57] see after the first coming of
[1:34:01] Jesus, there must be another coming of
[1:34:06] Jesus, the rapture.
[1:34:09] just before he comes
[1:34:11] again, the Elijah ministry must come
[1:34:14] back
[1:34:15] again. And if you read in the book of
[1:34:19] Luke chapter
[1:34:21] 17, the Bible right there speaks about
[1:34:25] the ministry of Elijah
[1:34:28] again. And he says Elijah when when they
[1:34:32] asked Jesus, listen carefully, they
[1:34:36] asked Jesus, why did the writers
[1:34:39] say Elias must first
[1:34:44] come? Jesus answered it and
[1:34:46] said,
[1:34:48] Elijah truly shall first
[1:34:56] come and do what? and restore all
[1:35:01] things. John the
[1:35:03] Baptist never restored anything. John
[1:35:06] the
[1:35:07] Baptist
[1:35:09] prepared for something new to come.
[1:35:15] So now we see there was an
[1:35:18] Elijah that listen that Jesus spoke
[1:35:22] about in future
[1:35:25] tense when he said Elias truly shall
[1:35:31] shall first
[1:35:34] come. This is this Jesus
[1:35:37] speaking. He's saying
[1:35:43] Elias first
[1:35:46] come but yet this one had already
[1:35:49] come
[1:35:50] John. Are you getting it now? So in
[1:35:54] other words, Jesus in that part of the
[1:35:57] scripture was speaking about the future
[1:36:01] coming of Elijah after his first
[1:36:06] coming. And he said that one shall
[1:36:08] restore
[1:36:11] her. But John never restored. He
[1:36:16] prepared. So the one who was
[1:36:19] coming before the second coming of
[1:36:23] Jesus which is this one which is William
[1:36:27] brother. His work was to restore all
[1:36:34] things. Amen.
[1:36:37] Are you following me church? So now we
[1:36:41] see he continues on in the book of uh
[1:36:44] the same
[1:36:45] book and he says but I say unto you
[1:36:49] Elijah has come
[1:36:51] already. So Jesus said Elijah truly
[1:36:55] shall first come and restore all things.
[1:36:59] And then he says but I say unto you
[1:37:01] Elijah has come already.
[1:37:04] Ah, he was talking about Elijah coming
[1:37:07] before his first coming and Elijah
[1:37:09] coming after
[1:37:16] his. Are you following me?
[1:37:19] Now Jesus knew the scripture like as if
[1:37:22] of course he is God. He wrote it.
[1:37:29] If John the prophet knew the
[1:37:32] scripture, how about Jesus himself?
[1:37:36] That's why when Jesus was quoting the
[1:37:40] prophecy of
[1:37:43] Isaiah 61, we don't have time to go
[1:37:46] there. In Isaiah
[1:37:48] 61, God was speaking to through the lips
[1:37:52] of
[1:37:53] Isaiah, speaking about the coming of the
[1:37:56] Messiah.
[1:37:59] Are you following me? And you know what
[1:38:01] he said? The spirit of the Lord God is
[1:38:03] upon me. He has anointed me to to set
[1:38:07] free the captives to open the prison
[1:38:09] doors there. Open the eyes of the
[1:38:12] blind. Follow closely now. And then when
[1:38:16] he went to verse
[1:38:17] two, he said, "And to declare the
[1:38:20] acceptable year of the
[1:38:24] Lord, and to comfort all them that
[1:38:28] mourn." Verse two, was speaking about
[1:38:32] the dreadful day of the
[1:38:35] Lord. Are you following me?
[1:38:37] He was talking about the bread of
[1:38:40] God. Verse one of Isaiah
[1:38:44] 61. Just go and start
[1:38:47] the he was then speaking about the the
[1:38:51] day the exac acceptable
[1:38:55] year the year of freedom when God will
[1:38:58] come in flesh and die for human
[1:39:02] race. It is a great day. That was the
[1:39:06] great day of the
[1:39:08] Lord. Now when Jesus
[1:39:11] came on
[1:39:13] earth in the book of Luke chapter
[1:39:17] 4, he actually quoted that same Isaiah
[1:39:24] 61. And he said, "The spirit of the Lord
[1:39:27] God is upon. He has anointed me." And he
[1:39:31] read the whole verse
[1:39:33] one. And when it reached on verse
[1:39:37] two, he he
[1:39:39] stopped. He cut it in the
[1:39:44] middle and he closed the book. Everybody
[1:39:48] looked at him. He left out the other
[1:39:50] part which was saying to declare the to
[1:39:54] to declare the day of vengeance of our
[1:39:58] God. He left it out. It's the part of
[1:40:01] the
[1:40:02] dreadful. It's about him. But during his
[1:40:06] second
[1:40:07] coming, he never read that part. He read
[1:40:10] the first part and he closed the book.
[1:40:13] Everybody looked at him and then he
[1:40:15] began to
[1:40:16] say this day is this scripture fulfilled
[1:40:21] in your
[1:40:22] ears. Meaning only the part which I have
[1:40:26] read that you have heard me
[1:40:29] read is fulfilled now. Amen.
[1:40:34] In other words, he was telling them, but
[1:40:36] there is another part which is to come.
[1:40:40] Jesus knew how to rightly divide the
[1:40:43] word of
[1:40:45] truth because he himself is the
[1:40:48] truth. So now we see church. Oh, praise
[1:40:52] the name of the Lord.
[1:40:54] So we see Jesus now was able to say
[1:40:57] Elijah's coming
[1:41:00] and he will restore all fear.
[1:41:09] He will restore all.
[1:41:13] Are you following me
[1:41:15] church? Restore
[1:41:19] all when Elijah comes before the second
[1:41:22] coming of Jesus Christ.
[1:41:24] He will restore
[1:41:27] all and that is the ministry of
[1:41:31] William after him the rapture
[1:41:35] goes after the
[1:41:37] rapture then the Elijah
[1:41:40] ministry will come
[1:41:42] again to the
[1:41:49] 144,000 this ministry
[1:41:53] is based on the message of this
[1:41:57] [Music]
[1:42:01] Elijah. His message is actually
[1:42:04] preparing
[1:42:06] people for the second coming of Jesus
[1:42:09] Christ. If they fail to
[1:42:12] see his message and his ministry, they
[1:42:16] will never see Jesus Christ.
[1:42:19] they will be cast.
[1:42:22] Why? It's not my words. He said he shall
[1:42:25] turn the hearts of the fathers of the
[1:42:27] children and the hand of the children to
[1:42:29] their
[1:42:30] fathers lest I
[1:42:33] come and I strike the earth to the
[1:42:37] c. Now in other words if Elijah ministry
[1:42:42] does not
[1:42:43] come the earth will be smitten with a c
[1:42:49] But it has come. I am here trumpeting
[1:42:53] the
[1:42:54] voice saying Elijah is
[1:42:57] come and our hearts have been
[1:43:01] turned. Hallelujah. Our hearts have been
[1:43:05] turned. Is your heart turned
[1:43:08] brother? Is your heart turned sister?
[1:43:11] Our hearts have been
[1:43:14] turned. Therefore we cannot be cast.
[1:43:18] We are the right
[1:43:19] people to read the scripture in
[1:43:22] Romans. And I say there is therefore
[1:43:26] now no
[1:43:28] condemnation to them that are in
[1:43:31] Christ who walk not after the
[1:43:34] flesh but after the
[1:43:36] spirit. We have been restored. We have
[1:43:39] been redeemed. We have Oh, hallelujah.
[1:43:42] Amen. We have been revived.
[1:43:45] We are right here in the bride's
[1:43:50] revival. Why? We have received Elijah's
[1:43:54] message. But those who turn away and
[1:43:58] they walk away and they refuse it, they
[1:44:01] are under a
[1:44:03] curse. And I can prove that to you. When
[1:44:07] God sent a messenger in every age, you
[1:44:11] know those who refuse to believe it,
[1:44:14] they were automatically
[1:44:17] cast. When Jesus came and the Pharisees
[1:44:20] refused to believe him, do you remember
[1:44:22] what he said? He said because you have
[1:44:24] refused to believe
[1:44:25] me, you are already
[1:44:29] condemned. They are not going to be
[1:44:31] judged in the future.
[1:44:33] We already
[1:44:35] judge and judgment is equals to
[1:44:40] C. Amen. Galatians 1
[1:44:44] 6. I
[1:44:46] marvel. This is Apostle Paul. Now, a man
[1:44:50] who had a
[1:44:51] message into the first church 8. I
[1:44:54] marvel that he has soon removed from him
[1:44:57] that called you into the grace of Christ
[1:44:59] unto another gospel.
[1:45:06] which is not
[1:45:08] another. But there be some that trouble
[1:45:11] you and I would provide the gospel of
[1:45:15] Christ. But then here now Paul begins to
[1:45:17] talk about the gospel of
[1:45:20] Christ. Listen church, the gospel of
[1:45:23] Christ is not words of a man. The gospel
[1:45:26] of Christ is not theological terms.
[1:45:30] The gospel of
[1:45:32] Christ, the gospel of
[1:45:35] Christ is the message of the
[1:45:38] hour that God gives to the man of the
[1:45:41] hour. That is the gospel of
[1:45:44] Christ. And it will always agree with
[1:45:46] the Bible
[1:45:51] 100%. We have many preachers
[1:45:54] today, tens of thousands of them. But
[1:45:57] let me tell you, let me tell you, our
[1:46:00] work is to re-echo the
[1:46:05] gospel. I do not have a message of my
[1:46:09] own. I have no private
[1:46:12] revelation. I am taking my message from
[1:46:14] the
[1:46:16] messenger. There was one star in every
[1:46:21] generation. And that star shine to the
[1:46:24] old
[1:46:24] generation. So God takes other
[1:46:29] men from the five-fold
[1:46:31] ministry. He anoints them to preach not
[1:46:36] another message to preach the same
[1:46:40] message. And when you know William
[1:46:43] Brandham started his
[1:46:44] ministry, he said I preach what Paul
[1:46:49] preached. He did not quote word for
[1:46:51] word.
[1:46:53] Then there are some of them who say well
[1:46:55] we have to read word for word and we say
[1:47:00] amen and go
[1:47:04] home. You know brother preached the
[1:47:06] message here. So let us now hear the
[1:47:09] word of God and you begin reading word
[1:47:12] for
[1:47:13] word and others are saying we shouldn't
[1:47:16] even read in our voice. We should put
[1:47:19] his
[1:47:20] voice, brother Banam's voice to preach
[1:47:23] to us. That's good by the way. We can do
[1:47:27] it. We have done it before here. But
[1:47:30] then the problem is when they say that's
[1:47:33] the only thing that can be
[1:47:36] done. They say pastor keep
[1:47:39] quiet. The word of God came on to
[1:47:42] brother. Let him preach. And then they
[1:47:45] go to church. They put on
[1:47:47] tapes only. They don't accept preachers
[1:47:50] to
[1:47:51] preach. I believe Jesus Christ is the
[1:47:55] same yesterday, today, today and
[1:48:00] forever. If he use brother Brham, he
[1:48:03] will
[1:48:04] use. If he use a big person, he will use
[1:48:07] a small person. He's the same same God.
[1:48:13] [Music]
[1:48:14] But you see there are some who have
[1:48:18] preached another
[1:48:20] gospel. He has said it's not
[1:48:23] another message we
[1:48:25] love in the same tapes we love to
[1:48:30] hear have perverted
[1:48:32] it and they want us to follow after a
[1:48:35] Catholic
[1:48:37] spirit. They want to remove the spirit
[1:48:40] from the
[1:48:44] church whereby you tell us one man will
[1:48:49] tell us what to
[1:48:54] hear the whole world that's a Catholic
[1:48:57] spirit I came from there I can no longer
[1:49:00] be bound
[1:49:01] again I have been
[1:49:04] liberated but here is what I believe
[1:49:07] each of us should listen to those steps
[1:49:10] each of us should feast on that
[1:49:12] food. It is a food for the
[1:49:15] bride. Amen. Each of us should read the
[1:49:19] Bible.
[1:49:20] Amen. But where we say because the Bible
[1:49:24] is is the only inspired
[1:49:27] message. We should come here in church
[1:49:30] and play the
[1:49:32] Bible and then we go
[1:49:34] back the book of
[1:49:38] Matthew and then it
[1:49:42] reads the book of the generations of
[1:49:45] Jesus Christ the son of David the son of
[1:49:48] Abraham and then after we hear
[1:49:51] everything go home.
[1:49:53] Amen. Is that
[1:49:57] apostolic? We believe in reading the
[1:49:59] book as individuals, but we also believe
[1:50:04] in anointed men of God coming down at
[1:50:07] the pull pit quoting from the same
[1:50:11] book and preaching to you a sermon that
[1:50:14] will change your
[1:50:15] [Applause]
[1:50:16] life. Can you shout amen to that?
[1:50:21] Amen. Amen.
[1:50:24] We love this
[1:50:26] message and this message stay the
[1:50:32] curse. And Apostle Paul the first
[1:50:35] messenger, he said, "But though
[1:50:39] we an
[1:50:41] angel come from
[1:50:44] heaven preach any other
[1:50:48] gospel, preach any other gospel.
[1:50:54] Let him be a
[1:50:57] cast. Let him be a cast.
[1:51:01] Whato? Paul, are you cursing people?
[1:51:04] Yes. Actually, Paul c
[1:51:09] people and even if he did not say
[1:51:12] it, they were already cast by preaching
[1:51:15] another
[1:51:16] gospel by believing another
[1:51:18] doctrine. Paul preached Jesus
[1:51:22] as the only lord
[1:51:23] god. Paul preached one
[1:51:27] god. Paul preached water baptism in the
[1:51:31] name of our lord Jesus Christ in much
[1:51:33] water. Paul say no women
[1:51:36] preachers. Paul preached the order in
[1:51:38] the
[1:51:39] church. Tong to edify the
[1:51:42] church not to confuse but to edify. He
[1:51:46] says if all of you speak in tongues at
[1:51:48] the same
[1:51:49] time you will be confused and even if
[1:51:52] someone comes in you he will say you're
[1:51:54] mad crazy but then he says one should
[1:51:57] speak another
[1:51:58] inter and one speak another interpret
[1:52:01] maximum in a church service
[1:52:05] three one
[1:52:08] speak in a church service these things
[1:52:10] are here in the
[1:52:11] Bible but the denominations they
[1:52:15] rejected that
[1:52:16] They said for us we believe in something
[1:52:18] else. You hear preachers on the
[1:52:20] microphone. Everybody pray in
[1:52:25] task. And that's why Amen. We have heard
[1:52:28] this message say come out of her my
[1:52:32] people be not partakers of a sin of her
[1:52:39] curse.
[1:52:41] Amen. Amen. where you go to church and
[1:52:45] looks like you have gone to a
[1:52:47] bar dance party or
[1:52:50] something. I love what I
[1:52:53] see and then you see they're calling
[1:52:55] themselves
[1:52:57] Christians. Even a a worldly person
[1:53:00] knows
[1:53:01] better. First of all, the way they dress
[1:53:05] does not portray their
[1:53:07] Christianity. I believe as the Bible
[1:53:10] teaches us, as Paul taught us, a
[1:53:12] Christian must dress in modest
[1:53:17] clothing. There's even
[1:53:20] preachers. You find you see the trousers
[1:53:23] they
[1:53:24] wearing, men, sometimes old
[1:53:28] men, sometimes with gray
[1:53:31] hair. And you find he he's dressing like
[1:53:34] a
[1:53:35] trouser whereby he looks like he's
[1:53:37] powered
[1:53:39] inside. He's walking but he's like a
[1:53:43] woman. Shame on on our
[1:53:47] generation. You see that's why the
[1:53:50] message has stayed the
[1:53:53] curse. Our
[1:53:55] safety is in the message of the hour.
[1:54:00] We should love the message
[1:54:02] because it is only the thing that God
[1:54:05] has used in our generation to take us
[1:54:07] back to the true Bible
[1:54:14] teachings. We are the true Jesus
[1:54:17] people. We are the true Bible
[1:54:20] believers. And we are not alone. There
[1:54:23] are many like us all over the world.
[1:54:30] Amen.
[1:54:32] Amen. You have seen them. We have had
[1:54:34] them in our meetings here.
[1:54:36] You've seen them from Switzerland, from
[1:54:39] France, from America, from Australia,
[1:54:42] from
[1:54:43] Ethiopia, right here in this church.
[1:54:46] They have come and preached to you.
[1:54:48] They've come and told you the same
[1:54:50] things I tell
[1:54:52] you. They've come from Zimbabwe. They've
[1:54:54] come from South Africa. They've come
[1:54:56] from all over and God has a bride. Amen.
[1:55:00] In every country on earth,
[1:55:05] we don't go to Bible college. But when
[1:55:07] we begin preaching, we say the same
[1:55:10] thing because we are under the same
[1:55:13] anointing. We believe the same message.
[1:55:16] We have accepted the same
[1:55:18] prophet and he has led us to the same
[1:55:21] same Bible.
[1:55:24] My my my my hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Oh,
[1:55:29] glory to God.
[1:55:31] Amen. In Exodus 12, as I'm approaching
[1:55:34] to finish now.
[1:55:37] Amen. Moses was another prophet that God
[1:55:40] used in his time. And Moses had a
[1:55:44] message. And Mo then Moses called for
[1:55:47] all the elders of
[1:55:48] Israel. And he said unto them, "Draw out
[1:55:52] and take you a
[1:55:55] lamb according to your
[1:55:57] families and kill the Passover.
[1:56:02] And he shall take a bunch of
[1:56:05] his and dip it in the blood that is in
[1:56:09] the in the
[1:56:12] bin. And strike the lint and the two
[1:56:16] side posts with the blood that is in the
[1:56:26] Benson. And none of you shall go out at
[1:56:30] the door of his house until the
[1:56:34] morning. What did you hear? The
[1:56:41] message. Oh my my
[1:56:43] my God had his people in
[1:56:48] Gosh. They were the
[1:56:50] minority, but they had the truth. We
[1:56:53] might be the
[1:56:54] minority, but we have the truth.
[1:56:58] We are not looking for big
[1:57:01] crowds. If we have them, praise the
[1:57:04] Lord. But that's not what we this
[1:57:06] message is purposed
[1:57:08] for. You see, when message when Moses
[1:57:10] was bringing his message, he didn't care
[1:57:12] how many were there. He cared about the
[1:57:16] souls that were supposed to be
[1:57:21] redeemed. and none of you. He gave them
[1:57:24] the message how they should take and eat
[1:57:27] the lambs and strike the blood on the on
[1:57:29] the
[1:57:34] dopest. For the Lord will pass through
[1:57:37] the to smite the
[1:57:41] Egyptians. For the Lord will come
[1:57:43] through to bring the
[1:57:45] curse. And when he sh when he seeth the
[1:57:48] blood upon the lint
[1:57:53] and on the two side
[1:57:55] ports. The Lord will pass over the
[1:57:59] door, and he will not suffer the
[1:58:01] destroyer to come in unto your houses to
[1:58:04] smite
[1:58:07] you, and he shall observe this
[1:58:10] thing for an
[1:58:13] ordinance to thee and to thy sons
[1:58:17] forever. Amen.
[1:58:19] And you know what?
[1:58:22] people who do not even if they were
[1:58:25] Jews, if they didn't take this message
[1:58:30] serious, they
[1:58:32] died. There was death in their
[1:58:35] house. The angel of
[1:58:38] death, the curse knew one
[1:58:42] thing, the blood. On Sunday, I spoke
[1:58:46] about the bleeding
[1:58:49] water. You see the bleeding word is the
[1:58:53] message in every generation. When God
[1:58:56] sends a prophet and he gives him a
[1:58:58] message that is the bleeding
[1:59:00] word. Now here we see in
[1:59:03] Egypt there was a prophet with a message
[1:59:07] that was the bleeding
[1:59:09] message. It was a message of
[1:59:12] blood. And whosoever would hear that
[1:59:15] prophet they applied the token. They
[1:59:19] applied the blood and when the angel of
[1:59:22] death came when the curse
[1:59:25] came it passed over
[1:59:27] them and went to another house. Is there
[1:59:31] blood the message of blood? No. Then it
[1:59:36] came
[1:59:38] in struck the
[1:59:40] firstborn and there was death in
[1:59:43] the
[1:59:46] even died.
[1:59:48] God is not respectful of
[1:59:50] persons. If you are out of the
[1:59:53] message, you are under a curse. God
[1:59:56] won't respect you because you are old or
[1:59:58] young or or have money or or or
[2:00:01] whatever. It doesn't
[2:00:06] matter. The curse will come
[2:00:08] upon. Paul said all day even if it is an
[2:00:12] angel from
[2:00:13] heaven if he doesn't believe this let
[2:00:16] him be cast. So this is not a
[2:00:20] negotiation, brethren. I'm not preaching
[2:00:23] these things for you to
[2:00:25] fear. I'm preaching these things to you
[2:00:28] so you can apply the
[2:00:32] blood. So you can
[2:00:34] rejoice and say, "Thank God for the
[2:00:37] message. Thank God for the prophet of
[2:00:39] Malachi 4. Thank God for the Elijah
[2:00:43] ministry.
[2:00:45] By this we have been
[2:00:47] saved from the curse. The message has
[2:00:51] stayed a curse off of
[2:00:54] us. We'll continue from there. God bless
[2:00:57] you. You may stand on your
[2:01:00] feet. Ah man. Thank you
[2:01:04] Jesus. Amen. Give the Lord a clap of
[2:01:06] praise
[2:01:08] everybody. Thank him for his grace.
[2:01:12] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. He's the
[2:01:15] master of the wind.
[2:01:19] Amen. Brother, can you come up and help
[2:01:21] me? Let us sing that
[2:01:22] song. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:01:28] Well, my board of life sails on a
[2:01:33] troubled
[2:01:35] sea. Ever there's a wind in my
[2:01:41] s. But my heavenly
[2:01:45] father, he watches over
[2:01:49] me when the breeze turns into a
[2:01:55] gay. Oh, do you know I know the master
[2:02:00] of the
[2:02:04] wind. I know the maker of the rain.
[2:02:12] Oh, he can calm my storm and make the
[2:02:17] sun to shine
[2:02:19] again. Do you
[2:02:23] know me?
[2:02:26] Everybody sing. Sometimes I
[2:02:28] s Sometimes I
[2:02:31] s like an eagle in the
[2:02:36] sky above peace. My soul can be
[2:02:42] found.
[2:02:45] Hallelujah. Unexpected storm
[2:02:48] will drive me from the high. We may
[2:02:54] bring me low, but it'll never bring me
[2:02:58] down.
[2:03:00] Oh, I
[2:03:03] know the master of the way.
[2:03:08] Oh, I know the
[2:03:15] big Oh, he can
[2:03:20] come.
[2:03:22] Hallelujah. Make the sun to shine again.
[2:03:26] Oh, yes, I
[2:03:32] know. Sing it
[2:03:34] again. I know.
[2:03:42] Oh, I know.
[2:03:52] Oh, he can
[2:03:54] come.
[2:03:55] Hallelujah. We make the sun shine again.
[2:04:02] Oh, I know the master
[2:04:09] ro. Amen. God bless. Let's sing. When I
[2:04:12] see the blood, I'll pass over
[2:04:15] you. Amen. How many thank God for the
[2:04:18] blood,
[2:04:20] the bleeding word in this house?
[2:04:22] Hallelujah. I don't know which key. I
[2:04:24] think just just follow us. Amen. And as
[2:04:26] the deacons perhaps bring the bags and
[2:04:28] we can also give the offerings as we
[2:04:30] sing this song. Christ our
[2:04:32] redeemer. Christ our redeemer died on
[2:04:37] the cross. Die for the sinner paid all
[2:04:42] his
[2:04:43] due. Sprinkle your soul with the blood
[2:04:47] of the
[2:04:48] lamb and I will pass. I will pass over
[2:04:53] you. Come on now sing it everybody.
[2:04:57] I see the blood. See the
[2:05:02] blood. I see the blood. I see the
[2:05:06] blood. Oh, I see the
[2:05:10] blood. I will pass. I will pass over
[2:05:16] you. Chiefest of sinners.
[2:05:19] Jesus will send all he has promised that
[2:05:25] will he
[2:05:27] do in the
[2:05:29] fountain of
[2:05:32] for I will pass. Yes, I will pass over
[2:05:36] you.
[2:05:38] Yeah. Heat.
[2:05:41] [Music]
[2:05:50] When I
[2:05:53] say I will pass, I will pass for
[2:05:59] you. Judgement is
[2:06:04] coming. Each one receive me
[2:06:09] just hide in the
[2:06:15] s. I will pass. I will pass over
[2:06:29] you. I see the
[2:06:32] blood when I see the blood. Oh, I will
[2:06:38] pass. I will pass you. Listen to this
[2:06:42] one now. All great
[2:06:45] compassion, oh boundless love, glory,
[2:06:48] all loving kindness, faithful and truth.
[2:06:53] Amen. Find peace and shelter under the
[2:06:57] blood. And I will pass I will pass over
[2:07:02] you. When
[2:07:04] I when I see the blood, I see the
[2:07:10] blood. When I see the blood, I see the
[2:07:14] blood. When
[2:07:16] I see the blood for the lamb, I will
[2:07:20] pass. I
[2:07:23] [Music]
[2:07:25] will wait when I see the I see
[2:07:31] the I see
[2:07:33] the blood when
[2:07:36] I see the blood of the lamb. I will
[2:07:41] pass. I will pass for
[2:07:43] the Oh.
[2:07:49] Amen. With
[2:07:53] me. Amen. With
[2:08:00] [Music]
[2:08:04] me. Give him a gra and a shout of
[2:08:07] praise. Hallelujah.
[2:08:09] Hallelujah. Thank you,
[2:08:12] Jesus.
[2:08:14] Hallelujah. When I see the blood, I will
[2:08:17] pass over you.
[2:08:20] Do you have the blood applied?
[2:08:23] Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:08:26] Amen. Let us first pray over the
[2:08:29] offerings. Father, we want to thank you,
[2:08:31] Lord, for the service you have given to
[2:08:33] us
[2:08:33] tonight. We appreciate you for the word.
[2:08:37] We appreciate you for the blood. We give
[2:08:39] honor to your name, Lord. And now we
[2:08:42] thank you for the
[2:08:43] offerings, tithes, and land fund that
[2:08:46] your people have given, Lord. Bless
