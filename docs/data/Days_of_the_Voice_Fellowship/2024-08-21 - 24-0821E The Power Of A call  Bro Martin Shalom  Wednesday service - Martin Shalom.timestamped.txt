[32:55] attained okay
[33:01] okay shall let us begin from vers s it
[33:04] says we are reading in the name of the
[33:07] Lord
[33:08] Jesus but what things were gained to me
[33:12] those that I counted counted loss for
[33:16] Christ yeah
[33:18] doubtless and I count all things but L
[33:22] for the Excellence of the knowledge of
[33:24] Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[33:27] suffered the laws of all things and and
[33:30] do count them but done that I may win
[33:34] Christ and be found in him not having my
[33:38] own righteousness which is of the law
[33:41] but that which is
[33:44] through uh the Faith of Christ the
[33:47] righteousness which is of god by
[33:51] faith that I may know him and the power
[33:55] of his resurrection and the The
[33:57] Fellowship of uh of his suffering being
[34:01] made conformable unto his death if by
[34:05] any means I might attain if by any means
[34:08] I might attain un the resurrection of
[34:10] the Dead not as though I had already
[34:13] attained either we already perfect but I
[34:17] follow after if that I may apprehend
[34:21] that for which also I apprehended of
[34:25] Christ Jesus Brethren I count not my
[34:28] soul to have apprehended but this one
[34:31] thing I do forgetting the things which
[34:35] is the things but forgetting those
[34:39] things which are behind and reaching
[34:41] forth unto these things which are before
[34:45] I press toward the mark for the prize of
[34:50] the High Calling of God in Christ

[39:56] calling this holy calling is the Bible
[39:59] says that we are called with a holy
[40:03] calling is not something
[40:07] common amen and when God calls you you
[40:11] have to
[40:13] respond blessed be the name of the Lord

[43:35] beginning whatever God started before
[43:38] the foundation of the
[43:40] world you will have to accomplish
[43:43] it and nothing can stop
[43:47] that amen we are unstoppable
[43:53] people there is no situation under the
[43:55] sun
[43:57] there is no weapon that can stop
[44:00] us amen because we are here for a
[44:05] purpose and that purpose must be
[44:10] accomplished blessed be the name of the

[45:05] day blessed be the name of the
[45:08] Lord amen we are bought with a
[45:14] price because we are chosen by
[45:19] God and because we were chosen by
[45:23] God that had to take God himself to come
[45:26] down
[45:30] to redeem
[45:31] us amen No Angel shows
[45:35] you we are not chosen by
[45:38] Bishops we are not chosen by pastors we
[45:42] are not chosen by
[45:44] evangelist but we are chosen by
[45:47] God
[45:48] [Applause]
[45:49] Amen and that's why we are following the
[45:52] word of
[45:55] God if you are chosen by
[45:58] man anytime that man can cancel
[46:02] you anytime he can kick you
[46:05] out he can disappoint

[46:21] known that you are chosen by God
[46:27] can shake
[46:28] you amen you will move his shoulders

[47:03] power behind that

[47:09] power that keeps us
[47:13] moving you remember when God sent Moses

[47:19] Egypt and God met him in the
[47:22] wilderness amen Moses
[47:33] blessed be the name of the Lord he knew
[47:35] that God had called
[47:37] him he knew that he was

[47:44] time to do that job he was supposed to
[47:47] wait on
[47:49] God for God's
[47:51] instruction that now is the time like
[47:54] the Gideon of
[47:55] old amen he told God if you're in our M
[48:00] where is your
[48:02] Miracle Gideon was waiting for God's
[48:06] command blessed be the name of the Lord

[49:14] Lord and Moses drw close to the the
[49:17] burning
[49:19] bush and came out of the bur Bush and

[50:23] staff the prophet say that when you ask
[50:25] Moses where are you going
[50:29] tell that I'm going to overthrow
[50:33] Egypt blessed be the name of the
[50:36] Lord it wasn't because Moses was moving
[50:39] with a
[50:41] stick but there was the power in Moses's
[50:45] go he had made
[50:48] theal amen and he knew he was no longer
[50:52] alone
[51:01] amen and this was God in man
[51:05] speak where are you going Moses I'm

[1:00:31] God and that was you and me because God
[1:00:36] had not amen there were some

[1:01:19] in
[1:01:19] us he sees this
[1:01:22] flesh and another mysterious
[1:01:33] he was the son of God why because Jesus
[1:01:38] had two
[1:01:41] personalities amen when he sees this one
[1:01:45] he sees the flesh this cannot be
[1:01:50] God the other day he slept in the boat
[1:01:56] there they slept that can be the God God
[1:02:00] in
[1:02:01] flesh God in flesh do you know God the
[1:02:06] devil was telling his

[1:12:06] the Lord what am I trying to say this
[1:12:09] man was there for 38 years but I believe
[1:12:12] in the 37th
[1:12:16] year something started
[1:12:20] off the Angels were getting close to his
[1:12:25] praise be to God and when Jesus went
[1:12:29] there hallelujah amen amenu Jesus passed
[1:12:34] his
[1:12:35] way why the power of God was upon the
[1:12:40] life of the man the full of and that
[1:12:44] power is what draws
[1:12:46] Jesus amen because before the foundation
[1:12:50] of the world he was in God's mind God
[1:12:54] had prepared is
[1:12:56] heing and when his time
[1:12:59] came there was no need for fearing

[1:13:31] scientist would have come out with a
[1:13:34] gag maybe like
[1:13:37] rder which can detect
[1:13:42] something and I believe maybe the
[1:13:44] healing would
[1:13:46] be because they see the light they
[1:13:50] just and I believe some even feared
[1:13:53] water
[1:13:55] but because of the condition they were
[1:13:57] in and this man was there but when his
[1:14:01] turn

[1:22:20] life and she didn't know at all she was

[1:22:31] world Amen God had called
[1:22:35] her blessed be the name of the Lord

[1:23:00] the when God was saving
[1:23:03] you amen it was unconditional
[1:23:08] Covenant he never told you that when you

[1:23:30] for and the
[1:23:32] evidence of the things you don't
[1:23:35] see you tell the devil I don't see
[1:23:39] salvation but one thing I'm sure all I
[1:23:43] am a Christian I am saved because Jesus
[1:23:47] said so the word said so he has given me
[1:23:51] the Holy
[1:23:53] Ghost blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:23:56] that is the power of the
[1:23:58] call
[1:24:00] hallelujah how many are called
[1:24:03] here yes sir God bless you blessed be
[1:24:07] the name of the Lord this woman was
[1:24:11] there and she had something
[1:24:15] unique because when Jesus spoke to
[1:24:19] her she said I perceive your prophet
[1:24:25] I believe that woman was
[1:24:28] religious and if could not made such a
[1:24:33] statement she used to go for for morning
[1:24:39] noen maybe she used to count
[1:24:43] rosaries maybe she used to
[1:24:46] take maybe she was I mean she was
[1:24:49] religious
[1:24:51] person but her religion could not
[1:24:53] deliver her
[1:24:56] it had to take
[1:24:58] Jesus the man of
[1:25:02] the much they could read him the
[1:25:06] scroll I believe that could not help
[1:25:09] him it had to take the scroll itself
[1:25:12] walking on
[1:25:15] fles and when the scroll came his
[1:25:19] way hallelujah amen the man picked his
[1:25:22] bed and went home
[1:25:25] and the Bible tells us Jesus said as was
[1:25:29] in his first
[1:25:30] coming shall it be in his second
[1:25:33] coming blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:25:37] this word put on flesh in the
[1:25:40] beginning the same word is putting on
[1:25:42] flesh
[1:25:44] today and God ising you and
[1:25:47] me blessed be the name of the
[1:25:50] Lord
[1:25:52] amen that out of
[1:25:55] cold nothing can blow
[1:25:59] it when Jonah was in the bottom of the
[1:26:04] sea it was a good example of a seed of
[1:26:11] God time
[1:26:13] came the same God who made him went that
[1:26:18] way he started disturb the
[1:26:21] sea St the Sea and the sea was like
[1:26:25] man we cannot bear this what do you want
[1:26:28] us to do he ordered the
[1:26:31] wave to go
[1:26:35] to blessed be the name of the Lord when
[1:26:38] the world swallowed
[1:26:41] Jonah I believe maybe it was in the
[1:26:47] morning it is a good day but after some
[1:26:51] time the prophet said that when the fish
[1:26:53] eat something
[1:26:55] he go to the bottom of the
[1:26:57] SE and rest
[1:27:09] there it wants to vomit the stomach is
[1:27:16] dancing as it wants to
[1:27:19] go nothing
[1:27:21] coming amen amen what
[1:27:25] happened somebody recognized his
[1:27:29] mistake and knew that had the power of
[1:27:33] calling and I believe before Jonah
[1:27:36] started to
[1:27:37] pray well was very
[1:27:40] okay amen but when he started
[1:27:44] praying Hallelujah when the wick of the
[1:27:48] Christian KN down to
[1:27:50] pray even the case of Hell will sh
[1:27:55] when he started to
[1:27:56] pray well was
[1:27:59] disorganized when Jonah was in the
[1:28:02] boat the sea was
[1:28:04] disorganized when he was cast into the
[1:28:06] sea well was
[1:28:09] disorganized
[1:28:11] amen that's when Jonah practiced what he
[1:28:14] had not seen
[1:28:17] before that's why the prophet says God
[1:28:21] uses desperation
[1:28:25] to bring the best out of
[1:28:27] you I believe Jonah had ever read that
[1:28:30] in the
[1:28:32] scroll and did not know how it
[1:28:35] works but but when he was in the belly
[1:28:38] of the
[1:28:40] world he made a
[1:28:42] prayer he said God when Solon was
[1:28:45] dedicating the
[1:28:47] temple he saw would fall in
[1:28:50] trouble when he turn his first and look
[1:28:52] at the temple of
[1:28:56] pray you hear his prayer from
[1:28:59] Heaven he was he didn't even know that
[1:29:02] he was facing that
[1:29:06] Temple and he was praying by
[1:29:09] faith praise be to
[1:29:12] God Amen maybe well was going another
[1:29:17] Direction but after the
[1:29:19] prayer well got the compass now
[1:29:24] up to
[1:29:25] n and went toward
[1:29:29] n blessed be the name of the
[1:29:32] Lord
[1:29:33] amen Jonah saw that scripture
[1:29:38] working the Bible tells us in his name
[1:29:42] we shall cast out demons we shall lay
[1:29:44] our house the seek shall recover we
[1:29:47] shall raise the dead brother sister one
[1:29:51] of these days God will put in a stress
[1:29:55] and you will see that
[1:29:57] scripture
[1:30:00] working praise be to
[1:30:02] God
[1:30:03] [Applause]
[1:30:05] Amen my sister there I believe one of
[1:30:08] these
[1:30:09] days yes you'll have a
[1:30:12] testimony we are very sure
[1:30:15] about amen and you will stand
[1:30:19] here you will read the scriptures
[1:30:24] your own
[1:30:26] s that word will put on
[1:30:30] flesh because what has hold you up to
[1:30:34] today it is the power of the call of God
[1:30:37] in your
[1:30:41] life blessed be the name of the
[1:30:44] Lord as I'm about to
[1:30:49] finish you see the Bible says where the
[1:30:52] devil is cast out out of
[1:30:56] somebody he goes in the
[1:30:59] dry and then he comes back after some
[1:31:02] time to
[1:31:04] shake that house where he used to
[1:31:08] stay and when he find that
[1:31:11] house he goes and bring
[1:31:15] back 10 more strong
[1:31:19] demons seven more strong demons
[1:31:24] and the state of that person the Bible
[1:31:26] [Music]
[1:31:28] says it becomes
[1:31:31] worse but let me tell you Jonah had
[1:31:36] backl but he was not
[1:31:38] lost and indeed Jonah's St was seven
[1:31:44] [Music]
[1:31:46] times first of all he made the the
[1:31:50] businessmen to lose their merchadise
[1:31:55] secondly almost the ship almost
[1:31:59] wreck he was cast in the sea he was in
[1:32:02] the
[1:32:03] wh say that when Jonah was
[1:32:06] praying when all de side was V when was
[1:32:11] vomit
[1:32:13] vomit it was worst state somebody could
[1:32:16] be
[1:32:17] in but let me tell you because the goal
[1:32:21] of God was in his life
[1:32:24] regardless of
[1:32:26] that
[1:32:28] amen hallelujah the world heart bring
[1:32:32] him
[1:32:35] out
[1:32:36] Hallelujah that's why we need to be so

[1:41:58] the champion of the
[1:42:00] champion amen and the devil has a
[1:42:05] record even in Hell there's a
[1:42:09] commemoration amen where the Devil's
[1:42:12] Backbone was broke by
[1:42:16] Jesus I believe when you Fe the devil's
[1:42:19] room in
[1:42:22] hell there is a big picture on the
[1:42:26] wall where where he placed his
[1:42:32] X-ray after Jesus gave him his
[1:42:37] level amen Jesus gave the devil
[1:42:43] level and the devil knows that very
[1:42:46] well that's why the prophet says when he
[1:42:50] comes to you and he said B you make a
[1:42:53] big
[1:42:56] b amen because the backbone is not
[1:43:10] okay blessed be the name of the Lord so
[1:43:14] Brethren this is the time to
[1:43:18] realize that there is the power of the C
[1:43:23] in our life that we are called with a
[1:43:26] high
[1:43:27] calling our High Calling is in Christ
[1:43:31] Jesus amen we don't need to worry about
[1:43:35] the situations around
[1:43:37] us when we meet
[1:43:40] problems just
[1:43:42] remember I am called with high
[1:43:45] calling when sickness invade our
[1:43:48] homes we tell that we are called with
[1:43:53] when we have no
[1:43:54] job we say we are call the high
[1:43:58] calling because there is a power behind
[1:44:01] that when Moses was sent to Egypt J and
[1:44:05] jambes came to his
[1:44:07] mes blessed be the name of the Lord they
[1:44:11] never
[1:44:11] knew that behind Moses called there was
[1:44:14] a
[1:44:15] power they performed the same magic he
[1:44:19] perform hallelujah hallelujah but the
[1:44:21] man of God was not moved
[1:44:24] because thus says the Lord he was God
[1:44:29] himself God never said that I've made
[1:44:31] you a smaller
[1:44:34] God he said you are God your brother Aon
[1:44:38] is a
[1:44:39] prophet can you
[1:44:43] imagine God was standing before
[1:44:47] pharaoh and Pharaoh was seeing man
[1:44:56] and yetes was not a
[1:44:59] man praise be to God you remember when
[1:45:03] Moses went before the
[1:45:05] Lord on the
[1:45:07] mountain and the Bible say when he came
[1:45:09] to the
[1:45:11] congregation Glory sh
[1:45:14] upon until the
[1:45:17] Israelites told him to cover
[1:45:20] his because they were dying
[1:45:25] I believe if PHA was a
[1:45:32] Believer that's why when you come in the
[1:45:34] service with unbelieving
[1:45:37] heart God will touch
[1:45:40] others just see normal
[1:45:42] things someone is getting
[1:45:45] delivered you are like What's Happening
[1:45:47] Here Bo what's going on
[1:45:49] here that's why I sit behind
[1:45:53] sometimes somebody can
[1:46:00] even but brother if I was
[1:46:05] you amen I just know that the Angels
[1:46:08] come to stay on the
[1:46:10] water let me tell you Brethren my
[1:46:14] brothers and sisters when is this such a
[1:46:17] moment start warming I say God I'm here
[1:46:20] when are you touching me when are you

[1:46:27] you the Holy Ghost will not will not bu
[1:46:31] pass you he will pass you
[1:46:34] away because somebody is
[1:46:39] warming praise be to God but if you're
[1:46:42] like what kind
[1:46:47] of my
[1:46:49] brother do you know that
[1:46:53] even hell is not called by the
[1:46:57] way are you seeing how deceptive
[1:46:59] denominations
[1:47:01] are hell is not
[1:47:05] cold hell is not
[1:47:09] silent I believe when they are
[1:47:12] there they even trust if they can climb
[1:47:15] and go out
[1:47:18] because and you cannot just be freezed
[1:47:20] and you like
[1:47:23] how about when the presence of God comes
[1:47:25] down one day the presence of God Came
[1:47:29] Upon

[1:48:25] comes but if you not careful
[1:48:28] enough and you are taking things for
[1:48:32] granted rather you will attend church

[1:48:37] a week you will listen to all the
[1:48:40] messages you will stream preachers in
[1:48:43] the
[1:48:44] YouTube and still remain the same not
[1:48:48] until you

[1:49:27] Rapture but on the final day will not
[1:49:31] knock he will only come and take those
[1:49:33] who are ready to
[1:49:35] go after attending church for 50
[1:49:40] Years be careful Les you

[1:49:46] presence of
[1:49:50] God God want to see us active
[1:49:54] he want to see us on
[1:49:56] fire because we are small
[1:49:59] magnets and when the mighty magnet
[1:50:03] comes that's when you see commotion in
[1:50:05] the
[1:50:06] church it because the greater magnet has
[1:50:10] near and those with magnetism will start
[1:50:15] dancing they start falling and
[1:50:18] rolling not gimmick it
[1:50:23] but when it is real real something's
[1:50:25] happening in their
[1:50:28] life

[1:51:11] fire where you find them running here
[1:51:13] and
[1:51:14] there blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:51:17] that's when they

[1:51:24] and the holy calling which God called us
[1:51:27] with the devil will never call you
[1:51:30] back no man will ever call you back
[1:51:34] because God called you he sounded for
[1:51:37] the
[1:51:39] trumpet we are moving
[1:51:42] forward and it will never sound a
[1:51:44] trumpet for
[1:51:46] retweet our God is not a god of the
[1:51:50] retweet he's a god of
[1:51:54] on the Bible says in Joshua 5 that when
[1:51:58] Moses after the death of
[1:52:00] Moses God spoke to Joshua and he told
[1:52:03] him when they reached uh he told him to
[1:52:07] to stop with the of
[1:52:11] Israelites and he commanded him to
[1:52:13] circumcise
[1:52:14] them in that place is called
[1:52:17] Gil of
[1:52:20] circumcision and the circumcision
[1:52:23] he told them to move
[1:52:25] on blessed be the name of the Lord God
[1:52:29] knew people they had no Covenant with
[1:52:33] him and they were the Young
[1:52:36] Generation who were going to possess the
[1:52:39] L God instructed J
[1:52:42] Joshua to circumcise them and for them
[1:52:46] to move forward the same God In Our
[1:52:49] Generation he knew that not make it
[1:52:51] without the Holy Ghost
[1:52:55] the same God In Our
[1:52:56] Generation he knew that without the Holy
[1:52:59] Ghost cannot make it he sent us the
[1:53:03] message with the true teaching of the
[1:53:05] Holy Ghost for us to receive the Holy
[1:53:07] Ghost and move forward and I'm here to
[1:53:11] tell you we are not of the one that

[1:56:01] offering
[1:56:03] bags thank you so much brother martin
[1:56:05] for yielding to the holy
[1:56:08] spirit amen as the Lord minister to
[1:56:13] you amen I think we need to have by m
[1:56:18] needs to preach part two The Power of
[1:56:19] responding to God's call
[1:56:28] there is power in God's
[1:56:32] call I wanted to imagine
[1:56:36] Moses the devil wanted to kill him
[1:56:39] at butes had a call of
[1:56:43] God and the devil couldn't kill
[1:56:46] him and then you know as he went to the
[1:56:48] waters as the mother put him to River
[1:56:51] Nile
[1:56:53] the devil wanted to kill him there but
[1:56:56] because of the power of God call upon
[1:56:59] his you know God instead took him to the
[1:57:03] Palace that to me I think that is
[1:57:07] incredible power
[1:57:10] over amen i i as my brother was
[1:57:13] preaching I was looking at my
[1:57:17] life I have seen the power of God is
[1:57:20] called how many have seen the
[1:57:24] the man lying at the
[1:57:27] pet
[1:57:29] years you know in that
[1:57:31] situation you
[1:57:33] know I love the way the brother said it
[1:57:37] he had become a
[1:57:39] citizen in that
[1:57:41] situation but because when Jesus came
[1:57:45] and called on him that was the end of
[1:57:48] that
[1:57:49] situation I want you to imagine that the
[1:57:51] power of
[1:57:53] 38
[1:57:54] years now you you could have a situation
[1:57:57] maybe for a few
[1:57:59] years 38 years hear me nothing cannot
[1:58:05] change when God calls
[1:58:08] you and when you respond to the
[1:58:12] call amen something must
[1:58:15] happen praise the name of the Lord the
[1:58:18] woman at the well you know imagine she
[1:58:21] had stayed with how many
[1:58:25] husbands five 1 2 3 4 5 and by the time
[1:58:31] she met
[1:58:32] Jesus she was with a
[1:58:35] sixth but then Jesus called on her do
[1:58:39] you think she went back to that woman
[1:58:41] that
[1:58:42] man do you think she went back to that
[1:58:45] man she had found another
[1:58:48] man Jesus amen she respond to
[1:58:53] call and the Bible says she dropped her
[1:58:56] picture and she ran back to the city
[1:58:59] Hallelujah she said come see a man who
[1:59:02] has told me everything about my
[1:59:04] life isn't this the very Messiah I mean
[1:59:08] her entire life was
[1:59:11] rearranged because of the power of that
[1:59:14] call I believe Jesus is still calling
[1:59:19] [Music]
[1:59:20] today May respond to that
[1:59:24] call Amen Let us sing all over the world
[1:59:27] the spirit is
[1:59:30] moving I'm not sure if that's the key
[1:59:32] but maybe you can just
[1:59:34] follow all over the world the spirit is
[1:59:40] moving all over the world as the prophet
[1:59:46] said it to
[1:59:47] be oh love of the world there the mighty
[1:59:54] Revelation oh the glory oh the Lord as
[1:59:58] the waters cover the sea will deep down
[2:00:03] in my heart oh thy spirit is
[2:00:08] moving deep down in my heart as the
[2:00:13] prophet said it will be come on now deep
[2:00:17] down in my heart well there's a mighty

[2:02:03] something but I'm seeing the spirit
[2:02:06] moving you know what we have heard today
[2:02:09] is not a words of a
[2:02:12] man I felt so strongly that brother
[2:02:14] martin needed to minister this
[2:02:19] evening myself I was a bit down in my
[2:02:21] body
[2:02:24] but I I felt a bit good
[2:02:27] today so I called him and and he said
[2:02:30] pastor if if you feeling better you can
[2:02:32] preach this
[2:02:35] evening no I still feel the leadership
[2:02:38] that you should
[2:02:39] preach he said well pray for me how many
[2:02:42] we are blessed this evening I believe
[2:02:45] that that was lead of the Lord let us
[2:02:48] give thanks to the Lord father we thank
[2:02:50] you so much
[2:02:52] for our precious brother that you have
[2:02:54] used and that he has yielded himself to
[2:02:57] be used of the Lord this
[2:02:59] evening father Lord you've given to us
[2:03:01] the Word of
[2:03:03] Life this was not a words of a man was
[2:03:06] Words of Life Lord I how I wonder how
[2:03:10] many people Lord do not respond to the
[2:03:16] call and that you would call and they
[2:03:18] don't
[2:03:19] respond and that you would call and they
[2:03:21] Remain the
[2:03:24] but Lord we have heard
[2:03:26] that Moses stood before
[2:03:30] Pharaoh Pharaoh saw a
[2:03:32] man but Lord we know that this was more
[2:03:35] than a
[2:03:36] man because he told him I'm sending you
[2:03:39] over to
[2:03:40] Egypt and he said you will be a
[2:03:44] God and Moses was God he represented you
[2:03:48] and he stood for you and he was you
[2:03:52] and when the children of Israel stood in
[2:03:54] that
[2:03:54] presence they recognized that presence
[2:03:58] but as they stood before Pharaoh Pharaoh
[2:04:00] saw a man and because he saw a man he he
[2:04:04] did not see what you were doing at that
[2:04:09] time but you were calling your children
[2:04:11] out of
[2:04:12] Egypt may we not be blinded like
[2:04:16] Pharaoh may we see what you're
[2:04:19] doing it was God speaking to us this
[2:04:23] it was not a man Lord it it was you
[2:04:26] ministering to us
[2:04:28] tonight and we receive it with all our
[2:04:33] hearts may we walk out of here
[2:04:36] today strengthened Lord powerin our
[2:04:39] spirit knowing no matter what because of
[2:04:43] the call that we have Upon Our
[2:04:46] Liv we are shed
[2:04:49] safe nothing can harm us
