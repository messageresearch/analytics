To commit the word into your hand that Lord, you will open our hearts that we might be able to receive. Father Lord, I've waited upon you. And I believe, Lord, that little inspiration you've given me this morning is for someone here that has come with need. Lord, I do not know who, but Lord, I'm one of those that have come, Lord, that I will hear from you, that you will mold me in your image, and I will know you in the power of your resurrection to know you as you know me, Lord. Father, I pray that you will speak to each one, those present and those uh streaming by the way of the internet. for those that shall listen to this service many days after that you will bless each one. Lord we commit uh the the preaching of your word and even those that are not able to be with us this morning Lord our sister Esther sent in a prayer request Lord oh God may you give her grace that as she's not well in her body touch and deliver her father God we remember our sister Ro have lost a a a relative. Lord traded. I pray that you will comfort the rest of the family and everybody else that might not be here this morning. Remember them, Father, that you will also visit them. Perhaps some will stream this hear from you, Lord. We give you all the glory. Amen. Give the Lord a clap of praise. God bless. God bless you all. God bless musicians. [Music] We turn uh to our Bibles this morning to the book of Genesis. Verse chapter 1 vers 26. If you're there, you say amen. I take it that you are not yet there. When you get there, say amen. Then I know you are. Okay. If you are there and if you don't have Bibles, please buy a Bible. If you can't afford one, we'll help you. But meanwhile, you can maybe follow the screen. Uh chapter Genesis 1. Amen. And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the f of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him. Male and female created he them. And God blessed them and and and and said unto them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fall of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. [Music] Amen. So this man was created in the image of what? Which image? Church. Have we come to church this morning? &gt;&gt; In whose image? God bless you. Now let us look at Genesis chapter 2 vers 7. And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul. So, how did he form him? I'm expecting answers out of the dust of the ground. &gt;&gt; Verse eight. And the Lord God formed uh planted a garden eastward in Eden. And there he put the man whom he had formed. [Music] Vers 15. And the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, of every tree of the garden, thou mayest freely eat, but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, for in the day that thou eat it thereof, thou shalt surely die. And the Lord God said, "It is not good that a man should be alone, and I will make him an help for him. [Music] So now the man of Genesis 1, we notice that he's in the image of God. But you see, he's is um he's a spirit man, as we will see. And then the man of Genesis 2 is now a formation formed out of the ground and then he is given rules to follow. But then he had he was a free moral agent. He could do choose to obey what God said or not to. It was a choice. Then now we see man in Genesis 3 19. In a sweat of thy face shalt thou eat till thou return unto the ground. For out of out of it was thou taken. For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. So we see now in Genesis 1, this is a created man in the image of God. And then Genesis 2, we see this is a dust man formed out of the ground. And Genesis 3, we see that this is fallen man. and uh uh you know we'll we'll be able to uh talk much about these things. Praise the name of the Lord. Genesis 1, created man in the image of God. Genesis 2, dust man not fallen. Genesis 3, dust man fallen. May God bless bless the reading of his word. You may be seated please. And I want to greet each and every one of you in the much uh precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord? I see a lot of people behind with no seats. We have some seats here so the deacons may want. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just before we get into the word, I wanted to let you know that Sister Rose lost a brother, a brother. So I she she informed me when I was very busy and not I did not have time to inform. You know we have a way that when one of us loses somebody the brothers and sisters try to believe with them. So even if you're not able to go but at least if you can send a message or [Music] is always encouraging when you know you have a family that has your back. Amen. A spiritual family. and also sister Esther. She's um you know having an issue with her health and she asked that we remember her. Brother Marvin, you have the pictures. Yeah. Uh yes. Um I think it was Tuesday. We had a a a baptism a mega baptism service and um we had a few who I also understand there are some who wanted to be baptized. But it has they were not they either did not know on time or were not able to make it. Is that sister one of those? &gt;&gt; Yes, sister Beatric. Where is she? Oh, right over here. Please let us welcome sister Beatric. God bless you, sister Beatric all the way from and she's I think a workmate of brother Julius and unfortunately she was not able to make it for the baptism service she also wants to be baptized. Amen. Amen. It used to be in in our days when we hear that someone wants to be baptized everybody would be excited because we understood what it meant. But I don't know your generation is different. We are saying someone wants to be baptized. People are just shaking. &gt;&gt; I'm saying someone who wants to be baptized. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's a wonderful thing. Yes. &gt;&gt; The day I decided to be baptized, people were like 10 in the church. But the noise was like over 100. I was like, is it a big? So, it it kind of encourages the person and uh so yeah, can we dim the lights a little bit, brothers? This um I hope that you have them, brother Dan, as well online. Yeah. Can you dim a little more, brother Shem? Okay, I hope you can see. You see the brother who is standing right there in the middle of everybody. Well, you need to have a seat, but he wanted to make sure he hears everything I said. Now, we know that a person that is to be baptized must be someone that has reached the age of accountability. But we do not know personally I do not know the age of accountability. Uganda says it is 18. Um as some other countries say it is 17. But u I believe that God has his age of accountability much lower than that. As as far as you can hear and refuse to believe or hear and believe. you have reached that age and um so um um my daughter my first daughter baptized I think it was seven years when she really asked me and pressed me I said well let's go for it and I think the second one as well Sharon came once I told her you're not ready so she never came back again and u then now eloo has been on my case for several months on and off but recently it became intense and for I think about three weeks every day in that period he has been waking up and asking me daddy are you going to baptize me today are you going to baptize me morning evening morning evening morning evening it's like he was just dreaming and thinking about it the whole And one time I asked him why do you want to be baptized? He said well I want to go to heaven but I also want to receive the Holy Spirit and and I also want to be a child of God. So um because you know he hears when we are preaching and he he wonders but I'm not baptized. So I thought maybe it's just young it will wear off but it kept on constant. So you can see what I'm talking about there. I did not know I I gave them a few pictures but I didn't when I saw this I remembered. You can see he was attentive listening to everything. After this little preaching, he came out with a question. Actually, you know, the people were many. So, he wanted to ask and then we went out before he asked. And then when we came out, his mom came and told me that he had a question. I said, "Oh, sorry. I did not know that you had a question." So, I don't remember the question you asked, but we went through it and and who was baptized At 5 years old, &gt;&gt; I was I was thinking he made a record. He made a record in our home. The youngest to be ever baptized. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. Amen. And uh uh also I think two children of brother Langa. One of them when they one of them had I was announcing we have a baptism service. One of them came right here. or from there up to here. And he was very bold. I &gt;&gt; think brother Victor, where's brother Victor? Victor, right over here. He came, pastor, I want to be baptized. And he was very serious. And so we had a little time with them and just to be sure it's not the parents telling them and it was their decision. So if a child decides, here's the word. leaves the world, decides, then the child is ready. &gt;&gt; With the children today with in this generation being so young doing things you can't even believe they can. It shows we are living knowledge has increased. So even on the spiritual side, I believe God will call his and he will he will find them early. Amen. And and so yeah, you can see me there talking to the little ones. &gt;&gt; You can continue, brother. &gt;&gt; And so you only have a little photos today. So uh we we have uh I don't know who this sister is. Sister Patience. We're baptized. Is this the patients here today? Oh, &gt;&gt; but I think you're not the one here. &gt;&gt; Another sister. She's a patient. She's a sister that we met at the baptism place and uh she finally made a decision and she was baptized and you can see her here. She's very very senior. Amen. And also there's sister to uh uh sister Martha sister Grace. God bless you sister Grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh also brother David Bassim and his wife over here. God bless you so much. Amen. These were baptized before in the Pentecostal church but they wanted to do it in the correct way. Amen. Brother just give me all the pictures you have. every all the pictures all the pictures let's keep them rolling I think I've forgotten a few other sisters but we had several of them and &gt;&gt; and it was a good time so allto together baptized nine people [Music] [Applause] are not for &gt;&gt; praise the lord &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; amen so this morning &gt;&gt; uh I'm going to speak on redeemed back to the blueprint I forgot but I was supposed to bring a blueprint &gt;&gt; of a building because there are some people who don't Are you one of them? They don't understand what a blueprint is. &gt;&gt; Blueprint. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I was supposed to bring to bring a blueprint. &gt;&gt; We call it a plan in Uganda. Yes. How many understand what I'm talking about? So, I was supposed to to bring it so I can spread it out to you, but I just it skipped my mind. So, but I'm speaking on redeemed back to the blueprint. Now a blueprint before they build any building they go to engineers. Do we have some engineers here? &gt;&gt; Raise up your hand. No, I'm talking about civil. Are they called civil engineers? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, we have one there. Brother, God bless you. Anybody else? Okay, now oh we have another one here over here. God bless you my sister. Uh I I did not know. So look with all these engineers their job well the other ones are also mechanical engineers brother. So just just make sure because the brothers may be offended for us butch they also engineers they are mechanical engineers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't worry it's a language issue. So now an engineer &gt;&gt; uh a structural engineer &gt;&gt; will will be able to tell you know about the pillars and the structure of the building and then you know they will draw the whole uh diagram and how everything is going to look you know inside and outside. And uh you know now when someone comes later to build. We also call him engineer, but I don't know the right words. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's that's the man. Now, when he comes to lay the bricks and to do everything to make the foundation and he does not do according to what he likes. He builds according to the blueprint. If it veers off, the owner of the building has a right to tell him to put everything down. It must be according to the plan. [Music] So when I talk about the blueprint, I mean the plan. The father God had a plan for your life. Amen. He said, I know the plans I have for you. So you already made a plan before we came here and that plan cannot fail. We have to be redeemed back. But the way we were born, we were born fallen. So what you see today is not fully the plan or the blueprint that the father had. Now let us take this now scripturally. Amen. And uh just go with me this morning so that you do not miss and I do not know if I'll finish this thought today. But we shall see how the Holy Spirit will help us. Um look at Genesis the first scripture which we read. I'm still struggling with my sound brothers. So, first Genesis chapter 1 26. Are you there? Are we Bible believers? Church. So, let us get into our Bible. Amen. Genesis 1. Look at verse 26. And God said, "Let us Yeah, this is better brother shame. Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, [Music] and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fall of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the y, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon it. So God created man in his own image. in the image of God created he him. Now this was God's original thought or design that man was to be in his image. What was the image of God in the image of God if you want to to look at it in Genesis uh in John chapter 4 today. Brother Marvin be very fast and try to put those scriptures for the people if you can. John chapter 4 vers 24 it says God is a my class today is a little dog. God is a &gt;&gt; God is a spirit. You know Sunday morning is usually Bible class. So let us enjoy the word. I want you to respond to me. I want to know your following. So God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. So God is a spirit. So to those who are saying God said let us make man. And therefore these was three gods, father, son, spirit. Each of them occupying a throne. Each of them a separate god. It defeats the very essence of God. Because God is a spirit and you cannot quantify a spirit. You cannot count a spirit. Spirit is um without end without beginning. Spirit cannot be closed in a bottle. So you cannot bottle God and say there is no other God. But God can be in this bottle but also be everywhere else. Amen. That's what it means for him to be omniresent. He is present in this bottle. Even when you go in hell, he's there. We don't we sing the song the love of God. It goes to the lowest hell. And the Bible says he's in the thickest of darkness. That's what the Bible says. So God is everywhere. He's on earth. He's in heaven. He's under the earth. He's the um the cover the spirit that coverth. &gt;&gt; He's everywhere. Understand first who God is. If you do not understand who God is, therefore you cannot understand what you need to be redeemed back to. you you will not even understand the original plan of God for you. The original blueprint, the design. So the design, the original design of God was for man to be like him. And God was a spirit. You see, so man was supposed to be in his image. So he say let us make money. But you see within that God there are many attributes and that's why he said brother get get the right words. Yes. So that's why he says let us because God is many and also God is one. When you say many, I don't mean as in persons. I mean as the attributes that make him. This water is many but it is one is many in that it has a lot of attributes. It has sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, chloride, sulfate. But it is one. But not one like your finger. You understand? But it is one. And that's how God is. Amen. And when I say this water, I don't mean this bottle. I mean the water itself. So God is a spirit and he's one but he has a lot of attributes and he can be in one container but also be in many other containers. even at the same same time. So that's why you know he says let us because he's there's a lot of attributes within him. He wanted to be a father, he wanted to be a son, he wanted to be a redeemer, a savior, a friend and many many other things. All that are the attributes that make God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he wanted to create man that was in his image, a spirit man. But that spirit man remember was going to be in the image of God. So he like God was also going to be one man but with attributes in him. That's why he says male and female created he He created man in his own image. Male and female created he him created he them. How many did he create? One or two one. But within him was more. How many? So that's how God was. And the man that was created also had more attributes. the woman was in him. That's why when it came to molding a woman, when it came to formation in Genesis 2, you don't find God molding two times. Read your Bible very well. He molded once and he breathed into him the breath of life. And then out of what he had molded, he took a rib and formed a woman. He didn't mold a woman separately because he didn't create a woman separate. A woman is a part of a man just like the man he created in his image, a part of God. Oh my. Are you beginning to get it? Amen. So when you say God, you are saying man because when you say man, you are saying woman because the the moment man was created, the woman was inside. The moment God existed, man was inside. So what is the true origin of man? The true origin of man is the true origin of God. Hallelujah. Let me say it this way in a lemon language. Wherever God came from, man came. Whenever whenever God existed, man existed. I'm talking about the man that was in his image. This man was not the dust of the ground. This man was in a spirit in the image of God. He was a spirit man in his likeness. He had dominion. He was created to have dominion. This spirit man was created to have dominion. He will, you know, his will. The will of this man was perfectly in alignment with God's will. This is very beautiful stuff that we're getting into this tonight. Amen. And and you know, you talk about the will of God. Today, we have to pray and find the will of God. Adam of Genesis was always in the will because remember he was in the image of God. Whatever he saying God said. Whatever God said because they were one with God that oneness which was within their essence one. He was perfect. He was sinless. And I want to tell you one more. This man of Genesis 1 could not be tempted, could not fall. Just like God cannot be tempered, cannot fall. That's how this man perfect. Praise the name of the Lord. Let me read for you some quotes as we we carry on in the message demonology physical realm. Brother Martin, you might want to check this. So how that God back in the beginning, what he did there, how he moved down into the earth and how that he made man in his image. If you give me your undivided attention, we are going to have a very good spiritual meal this morning. Amen. And how he moved down into the earth and how he made man in his image. And then God turned around and he was made and he was made in the image of a man to redeem man. We shall come back to around the end. Now when God made man in his image, he was a spirit man. Amen. In the message, God is power to transform. Now we find out that many times it looks like the Bible repeating or saying something to what it doesn't say. For instance, in Genesis 1, we find that God created man in his own image. in the image of God created he men and female created he and then go he goes on and many many things happened upon the earth then we come to find out there was no man to till the ground then God created a form man out of the dust of the ground that was a different Man, hold your thoughts together now. And he breathed the spirit of life into him and he became a living soul. The first man was in the image of God which is which is spirit. How many are following so far? The first man was in the image of God which is spirit. John 4 says, "God is a spirit that they that worship him must worship him in spirit and truth." But God is a spirit. And the first man that he created was spirit man. And he was in the image and in the likeness of God. Are you following? All right. Now, let us just follow me closely as I'm trying to build this for you. spiritual signs of the time. Brother Bam said something there that I want to when God made man in his own he was a spirit man and there was no man to till the soil then he put him in the earth rather he put him in five senses. Amen. Are you getting it now? We learn about five senses in school. You know, see, taste, smell, touch, hear. These are five senses that we are currently in. But you see we cannot be able to um you know, how can I put it for you to understand it very well? The five senses, we cannot have them if we do not have a body, a body that can contact the earth. That's why now it explains why God now begins in Genesis 2 to form a body. [Music] You notice that your body has all the contents of the soil. Whatever the soil is made of, your body is made of. That's why a true believer does not concentrate on this body. No matter how beautiful you think your body is, it is very cheap. How much? Does someone know some good scientist here? A few cents. Yes. Huh? 94 cents. Your body is not even worth $1. And that's true. If we were to take your body and burn it and we will take it and separate it in all these elements it can be both those elements potassium what it will be separated zinc and the total cost the total price is 94 cents Think about it. So you don't have to spend all your time on this body. That's why believers don't even waste their time with with with makeup. We don't have time for that. Our sisters don't have time for that because they have a revelation. They're worth much more than this body. They are putting all their time in beautifying and making up something that is worth much more than the body. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And and the makeup of that is the word. Amen. So we see that the body had to be uh formed so that now man can be able to contact the earth where he has been placed. And uh you know those senses were given to him and these senses help him to contact the earth so that he can be able to rule over the earth so that he can be able to subdue the earth have dominion over the earth control the other animals. He had to be a part of them. So then he says now we are looking at Genesis 2. He made him an animal with the spirit of God in him. He made man an animal with the spirit of God in him. &gt;&gt; Okay, follow me now. We are m What does a mamo mean? warm blooded animal and and and the quote I'm reading here was spoken by someone who only finished senior P7. So he most of these things he was inspired because he was a prophet. He says we are a warm-blooded animal which means we are an animal. God came down in the form of a man also. A man as a man took the form of God. Then God took the form of a man to redeem back. And we shall come. We shall come back to that part of the end. Okay. Now, but let us for now focus on Genesis uh 1, 2, and 3. Look at Genesis 2:7. It says, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground. and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul. And the Lord God commanded and uh sorry, the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there he put the man that he had now formed. And out of the ground, the ground he made to grow many trees. And now he came to this man and he told him the man he had formed out of the glass. He told him now you will eat of everything but do not eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Do not touch, do not eat it rather, but others you can eat. So now this man of Genesis 2 was placed in this place so that he will be subjected to tests. So that he will be subjected to tests. Tests I think that's a different word brother. You know he says what he said is free will. Yes. He was subjected to free will, but he was also subjected to tests or temptations. You know, God is the master architect. He's the one who made the blueprint. He's the one who made the blueprint and he knew how everything would end. So there is a reason why he put man he removed him from the other place where he was and he placed him here in Genesis 2 because he wanted man to be subjected to tests. Yeah. And also because God is a good God. He did not want this man to be tempted and to be overcome on the basis of what God had decided. It is what God chose. God is a good God. Tell your neighbor, God is a good God. Why? He gave this man something. He gave him the ability that he never gave to animals. That ability is called free moral agency. Agency, free will. Now, this man of Genesis had the ability to decide to do something or not to do it. So this man of Genesis 2 had his own will. Remember the man of Genesis 1 did not have his own will. Oh yes, he had a will. that this will was automatically aligned and synchronized with the will of God. But the man of Genesis 2, his will was independent of God's will. So he could decide to submit subject to the will of God or he could decide to do his own will. That's the ability that that man had but then God put him under that and he said I give you the word now eat everything but don't eat this. Now that was a test. Will you be subject under my will? My will is don't eat that tree of knowledge. But it's up to you. So it's up to you. You can do what I want or you can do what you want. [Applause] But man, even if he was in a body of flesh within him was the life of God. And the devil knew that. That is why he never came to man. He came to a part of a man. The woman and when he came to the woman, he was very sure this one I can make up for. This one I can deceive. And if you check your Bible, the Bible says it was not the man who was deceived. 1 Timothy chapter 2, I believe vers 16 or 17, he says that it was not, it was the woman who being under transgression, you know, she was deceived. Oh brother, I wish you had given me the the verse quickly. Let let us check it out now. &gt;&gt; All right. Listen. Listen now. He says, "Uh-huh. But I suffer not a woman to teach." All right. Okay. Verses uh Yeah. verses um 14. For Adam was first formed and then Eve and Adam was not deceived. And Adam was what? &gt;&gt; Come on church. Come on church. And Adam was not. &gt;&gt; So always remember that in what I'm trying talking about it has a meaning a son of God. He that was taken out of God even if he was in a downgraded version he could not be deceived. But the devil was so subtle that he came in another version of Adam and deceived her. But the woman being deceived was in the transgression. Now follow me closely. So why was the woman deceived? Because the Bible says she was the weaker vessel. But after she was deceived, oh my, I want to go ahead of myself a little bit, but after she was deceived, she came to Adam and Adam said what blah blah blah blah blah. Adam would have decided that from today I am chasing you out of here. I you're no longer part of me. You have sinned. You have been deceived. Let me tell Papa God that you have spilled our our lineage. But Adam could not do that because Adam had a revelation. This woman is a part of me. She does not have another redeemer. I son child of God. I am the only of the chief. If I let her go, no one can help her. And so will every man have that revelation to know you are the savior of the body. Every husband knows that. Every husband will protect his wife. Every husband will fight for him. If you you attack a wife, of somebody you very well automatically know that money is going to bring you hell. Even me I'm a good brother but you touch my wife you will see. That's why in the world there when you find husband and wife they slapping each other and then you come and begin to beat the man where he be that woman can turn against you saying who who told you to come and in our things. What am I saying? You see the woman is a part of a man and even now Adam knew I am the only hope that she Amen. A man must love his wife so much that he must be ready to die for her. Just like Jesus loved his bride so much that he was ready and willing to die for her so that he can redeem her. Hallelujah. In the same way, Adam knew I am the redeemer of my wife. I have to redeem her. And Adam knew, the prophet says, Adam knew what he was doing. &gt;&gt; He knew what he was doing when he accepted to partake of the fruit. He knew what he was doing because he knew the moment he partakes of the future he would have become one with him with a woman partners in crime. So when his redeemer when his redeemer comes he will not destroy the woman. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he will have to destroy Adam. But he could not destroy Adam. You go and read your Bible. You will find that the Bible says when God came down, he asked the man, "What have you done?" He said, "The woman you gave me." And he asked the woman, "Where have you gone?" And the woman said, "The serpent." Now when God began cursing, he said, "Cast you be the serpent. What you have done from today, you are cast above all creatures." This was an animal with four limbs, like you and me. It could talk. Like you and me. Can you imagine? It was the closest being to a a human being. It did not have a soul. So the devil came into it incarnated it and then it came and beguiled Eve and after Eve was completely defeated then she brings the same thing to her and he was a partaker of it and when this happened God came down and so he began by cursing the Sabbath. Why? Because he could not he didn't have time to worship the Sabbath. The serpent was never in his image. &gt;&gt; It was just a creation. And then he said, "Cast be you. From today you will crawl on your belly. You will eat dust. So it could no longer have legs. No longer eat like us. All the hands were deformed and everything." So a snake, we know where it came from. It was not a snake in the in a snake in the beginning. Some of you didn't know that. That is the missing link. Come on. That's the missing link. People think we came from evolution. No, man did not come from evolution. Evolution. Man did not come from evolution. The reason why they say that because according to science they see there is a resemblance between the mammals animals and the man and they feel perhaps my man was an animal and he was like this he went on changing he went until what he is today. But the prophet of God, his name is William Brham. William. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. When God spoke through him, he gave a revelation that had made scientists scratch their head for centuries. He told them, "No, the missing link is not that." And you know the science has been trying to find the missing link. What exactly happened? I can't understand because it is so chained. It is not in the original form. They've tried to make different animals see mingle with the humans to see whether a human can. It is not possible because God cast it beyond repair. meaning that it can never again mingle with a woman to bring forth a child. But you see it is a serpent. It's a snake. Today it is the missing link. We know that was the mystery. What happened in the beginning? &gt;&gt; Follow me closely. Praise the name of the Lord. So God cast this scripture, beyond repair, beyond recognition. And then he come to the woman. He said, "As for you, you will give birth in pain. And your desire shall be upon your husband, the man. From that time, women are no longer allowed to be teachers of the word." If you if you read in 1 Timothy chapter 2, that is even the reason God gives. He says, "Let the women learn in silence with all subjection, but I suffer not a woman to teach or to assert authority over the man, but to be in silence." And the reason is because Adam was first born, then Eve, vers 14. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was being deceived. She was in the transgression. But not withstanding, she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith, charity, holiness, and sobriety. So now even when you go in the book of Titus where the Bible says women must be teachers of good things, What kind of teachers are they going to be tomorrow? The Bible is very clear. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Brother Marvin, if you help me, we shall go fast. But if you don't, we are going to have trouble today. Amen. Because it looks like today I'm full of scriptures. All right. Look at at at this one here. All right. What does it say? He says that about about Okay. Where where is it? Is it chapter chapter 2 verse what? We don't have Bible readers here. Vers 14. Praise the Lord. Chapter 2 verse. Oh yes, God bless you. Listen. The edged women likewise that they be in behavior becometh as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given too much wine. teachers of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet, church, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands that the word of God may not be blasphemed. That is the work of the women who are seasoned. They teach the younger women how to do these things. Amen. When a woman leaves that and she comes on the pull pit as an apostle or as a pastor or as a bishop, she has left her place because in the book of 1 Timothy chapter 3, the Bible talks about the requirements of a bishop. or a pastor. He says if a man desires the office of a bishop, he desires a good work. And then he begins to talk about it. And then he says he must be a man who is married with one wife, not a woman who is married with one husband. So every woman who is calling herself a bishop, she's out of the will of God. who is calling out ourel a pastor is out of the will of God. I am so sorry. Here at DVF we preach the Bible. It doesn't matter how it makes us feel. Oh pastor, you are hurting my feelings. I am so sorry to hurt your feelings, but I'm not so sorry to talk about what the Bible say. No, I'm trying to build something for you. And then when he reached the man he could not place any cast what did he do? He said cast be the ground from where you came from. He did not cast the man that was in the image of God. But he cast the ground. That is why until today our ground is sick. Our ground is sick. Where is our ground? Where we came from? Right here. The one you saw in the mirror before you came. The one you washed, the one you perfume, the one you put on very good jelly and lotion, they are cast. So every time we walk, we have a cast around us. This flesh, it is cast. That's why no matter how you wash, it will stink. Try it. Go and shower. &gt;&gt; Perfume yourself. &gt;&gt; Put on a very good lotion and then begin doing this. We used to do it when we were little babies and then it's cast and the ground you know it will bring forth thorns. This one begins to bring cancers. Where does cancer come from? Where does HIV come from? Where does you know all these diseases come from? The ground is cast. Have no hope in this ground. Have no hope in this place. That's why let me tell you all your substance everything that you do serve the Lord with it. Because this flesh, you will take care of it. You will do everything you can. It will die. The Bible says it came from the ground. He will go back to the ground. But there is a man who came from God and he's going to be redeemed to God according to the blue. Hallelujah. You see? So now when God redeemed when God comes down to redeem the man, that was his plan. Amen. He allowed him to come and visit. He allowed him to exercise his free will. Him as God knowing that man will make the wrong decision. He did not make man to make the wrong decision. But man in himself decided using the faculty of free moral agency, he made a wrong decision. But God before the foundation of the world, before he created man, he knew when I give man the ability to make his own choice, he will make a wrong choice. So that me as God, I can have my other attribute of redeemer so I can come forth and I redeemer. Hallelujah. It was a provided way. God knew how everything would end. That's why I always say we are predestinated. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He knew our end to that destination. [Music] &gt;&gt; And then he saved man. But when man was redeemed, everything he had everything he and everything he had was redeemed with. Hallelujah. Amen. The the the the woman was the very first one. She was retained. Amen. Did you even know that according to the Bible, a woman wasn't supposed to be married if she was not a virgin. If they found out they would stone her to death and you know the the but now under grace dispensation that's no longer the case the Bible says all things are dead are passed. For if any man be in Christ he's a new creature. Old things are passed away. Old things are new. It was only I I have not don't have time. It was only the the the the man that could enter the Holy of Holies. If we follow the Old Testament, the women wouldn't get it. But when Adam was redeemed, everybody was redeemed with that. And today, everybody received the Holy Ghost. Men and women, children. The Bible says there's no more women. There is no more men. There is no more children. There's no more two. We are all free men in the spirit. for Christ. That's why the Holy Spirit will come upon every woman, man, and children. They begin prophesying. They begin telling dreams that you know interpreting tongues. Praise the name of the Lord. And the ground too was redeemed. Hallelujah. Everything. Now, let's continue here. This man was formed from the dust. This man was subject to test and free will. He fell. Everybody say he fell. But the plan of redemption remained intact. What was the plan of redemption? [Music] It was there. It was called the blueprint. The plan of redemption was Genesis chapter one man in the image. Hebrews chapter 2. Then God I just read a quote out of that. It says, "Then God made man out of the dust of the earth. He gave him a hand like a chimpanzeee. He gave him a food like a bear. He gave him made him on the he made him on the image the the earthly body in the image of the animal life and it's made out of the same kind of material. Your body is made just the same kind of material like a horse, dog, anything. It's made out of calcium, potassium, petroleum, cosmic light. All flesh like that is not the same flesh. It's different flesh, but it's made out of the dust of the earth. But the difference between an animal and a man is God put a soul in a man and he didn't put it in the animal because the soul that was in the man is that theophony in the message. Who is this Melisedc? You know what the earnest money is? Don't you know are you you have to you have to always pray for preachers &gt;&gt; because you see you study and you wait and on the Lord and you pray and you get a lot of things to read and a lot of things but you want it to make sense to the people. So you as you you're hearing just pray for me and you will walk into the place where I am &gt;&gt; and then you will your your soul will be fed. &gt;&gt; So listen an earnest and this if the Lord gives us time we shall come to it later. The earnest. So the earnest is a down payment. He was wounded for our transgression. With his stripes we are healed. Notice how wonderful we love him. Now this body is subject to the spirit. Have not ye entered into the word form but we are still in the flesh form but subject to the word. Death in the flesh will take us there. That's the same thing. Think of a little baby. There's something I'm trying to explain to you. You can take a woman, no matter how evil she is. When she's pregnant and fixing to be mother, before that baby is born, I don't care how cruel the mother might be, she will get real kind. There is something about her son how she talks. It seems godly to see a little mother fixing to become a mother. Is that true? &gt;&gt; Women who are about to give birth are always sweet. I am asking you mothers, is that true? [Music] &gt;&gt; Well, you may not answer me. I know it is true because I am a wife. And I've seen whenever she's about to give birth, she's always very dandy and happy. Why that little body now? It's not alive yet. The only thing it is just the flesh and muscles. That little jumping that's just muscles jacking. But when it comes forth from the womb, God breathes the breath of life in it and then he screams out. See, as sure as there is a natural body being formed. [Music] There is a natural body being formed in the body of a woman of a mother. There is also a spiritual body to receive it as soon as it gets here. When I'm now in the same way, when a man is born again from heaven, he becomes a spirit babe in Christ. Brothers and sisters, I pray that God will impress this on your heart. I'm showing you how you get back to Genesis 1. Tell your neighbor, you have to be born again. [Music] And then when this robe of flesh is dropped, there is a natural body theophony. A body not made with hand neither born of a woman that we go to when we a man dies having been born again. Oh, may God help you to bring this brother. Amen. When a man is born again of the spirit of God and he dies, the moment he dies, he drops this body and he walks into another body. The body he walks into is called theophony body. It's a body like this one. You don't just become a vapor or spirit. It's a spiritual body you walk into. It's not made with hands. It's not Genesis 2. It's not a dust of the ground. Amen. It's not born out of a woman. Then that body returns back and picks the glorified body. Now some of these things we're going to get it slowly. Listen, that's the reason Jesus went to hell. When he died and preached the souls that were in heaven, he came back with a a theophony. Oh, marvelous. Thank God. 2 Corinthians 5. If this body be dissolved, this tabernacle, we have another one. And we, you see, we bypass that to come straight from God, the attribute to be flesh, to be tempted and tested by sin like Adam did. Don't worry, I'll explain it to But when testing of his word is over, then we are taken up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world. When the testing is over, when the time of temptation is over, brother sister, we are going back again to the image we lost. We are going back again to the offic. Hallelujah. This is not my real body. Wait and see me over there. This body becomes sick. This body is lustful. This body is sinful. This body can be tempted. I tell you what, even when you have the Holy Ghost, you will still have weaknesses in this body. But brother, sister, wait until we cross over. Wait until we drop this body. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; When we walk into our body that we will see a body, we will be the man of Genesis 1. We will be the man in the image of God, a man that cannot see, a man that cannot fall, a man that is perfect. Let me build it for you a little more. Amen. And then we become the word. Here we are formed to the word image. So right now brother one we are being formed. Amen. Genesis 1. God speaks the word. Let there be man in my image. Man was formed. Man was created. in the image of God. And then Genesis 2, man forms, God forms man in the dust of the ground. Are you hearing me? And man to do what? To be tempted. But then brother is saying while we are in this body after the coming of Jesus, in this body we are now again [Applause] &gt;&gt; being formed. I am being formed. Hallelujah. Why do you think I'm sweating? &gt;&gt; It's not me. Amen. Is God because my body listen my body cannot take the pressure of the spirit. The spirit in me is the one forming you, speaking through me like a gun will shoot a bullet. What is happening? You're being formed, not the body, but your spiritual body. You are being formed in it. As you hear the word, you begin to hear from your spiritual body. You begin to connect with your spiritual body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on, deacons, help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; You begin to connect. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about. That young man is connecting. Just listen here. Don't be distracted. Don't be distracted. When you hear the word, your fear body is connecting [Applause] connecting connecting. And when it has fully connected, you will drop this one. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm talking? You will drop this one &gt;&gt; and you will put on the other one. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Okay, listen. Amen. You see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey, many of you can remember it. You know, before we continue, deacons, you should always be on a lie. Amen. You know, go go when when the word is going on, things are happening. All right. So, please let us be proactive. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, you don't want someone falling down and breaking their their leg or something. You can always help them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When someone is in the spirit, please always help them. Amen. See you you had a little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey. Many of you can remember. You joined this church and you joined that church. You tried this. You tried that but you were not satisfied. [Applause] Are you like me? I was not satisfied. But one day when you heard this message, you recognized it. What was that? &gt;&gt; You heard from your spirit of Praise the Lord. Now, let me try to give you a little summary. You may be seated if you can. Now, listen. In Genesis 1, here we see spiritual man. What do you want to call him? Theophony. Spiritual man. He was a spirit man created in the image of God. The word body. The word body. Theophony. The word body. And you see this body was in the condition that it was eternal sinless and cannot be tempted. &gt;&gt; Cannot be tempted. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. We are not yet in that body again until right now. Spiritually some of you already are but not fully because this body is spirit. Okay listen in the message you will see Jesus in the beginning God was a spirit and all the fountain of goodness and mercy and power and all the good the good things of life. God was the center of that fountain. And then the locos that went out of God in the beginning become what we would call a theophony, a supernatural body. God is just not like the air but is in a body. Hallelujah. A you remember when God when Moses said I want to see you God said all right he saw a back of hey you can see a body [Applause] God was in that body it's not a physical body is aopa spiritual body When we die, when we are changed, we walk into that body. It is as real as this is and more real because this dice, the other one does not die. Moses seen him pass and he said it looked like a back part of a man. And then that same Theophony was made flesh and dwelt among us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He beheld his glory, &gt;&gt; the only begotten of the father, Christ. Now that's Genesis one. That's a spirit man. And that's his form which he was in. Genesis 2, he was a dust man not yet fallen. When God breathed into his nostril the breath of life, he became a living soul. You see, his nature was dusty body with the breath of God in him. So he was a living soul. So he was innocent. He was not fallen. But he was capable of choosing. of falling or not. But you see, why did God bless him to be tested in free will? So that God can manifest more of his attribute as a redeemer. Are you following now? Now Adam in Genesis 3, he was totally fallen dust. The net is dust now fallen completely separated from his theophony guilty cast reproduction by sex you know and and and that's how Adam was and you know he passed sin and death onto all his sin. All of us here brothers and sisters, we are born that way. We are not even born according to the man of Genesis 2. We are born according to the man of Genesis 3. I hear people say on weddings in the image of God. Who are you in the image of God? You know what you're talking about. You're talking about Genesis 1. None of them is image of God. You know what you're talking about. But many believers have have arrived in Genesis. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is not our end. Genesis 2 helps us to hear from our fearful. Hallelujah. Amen. whereby we are we have we have heard from and we have power to make a choice because remember we are still in the dust body the dust body can fall &gt;&gt; and can refuse to As long as that of life, as long as that Holy Ghost is there, as long as that the Holy Ghost is there, it's a part of your fearfulness. Now, when you hear the word, you receive the word, you receive the Holy Ghost. What happens to you? You are still a dust man. Not in the image of God. As far as your body is concerned, but spiritually, you are in the image of God. Hallelujah. A man with the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; a man dust body can still do wrong things if he decides to. But a man with the Holy Ghost cannot sin, do any wrong things according to his decisions. You are like Adam when his wife came. He would have said no or yes. But he said yes and he fell. But he knew he had a redeemer. But Jesus died once he will not do twice. That's what the Bible says. After we have come to Jesus Christ, after we have seen the light, after we have tested of the gift of the Holy Spirit, if we go back again, there is no more sacrifice. Hallelujah. When a man receive the Holy Ghost, let me tell you, brother, you have a power within you to bring this flesh and subjection to begin to control your seeing, &gt;&gt; you are hearing, you are touching, you are touching. You have the power within you. Hallelujah. But this is not the end. This is the earnest. The the Bible says the Holy Spirit is the earnest is a down payment. There's more coming. Genesis 2 is the earnest. Genesis one is on the way. What is Genesis 1? We must be fully back again our theophony body. Hallelujah. [Applause] I tell you friends, this is true. Follow me closely now. Praise the name of the Lord. Are you enjoying the word? Says Adam forfeeded everything in the bridge. Brother Bham says he forfeited the book of redemption. And where is the book now? It is back to its original owner because it has been forfeed by a son, the first son in a human race. And when he fades to listen to Satan, he gives it up. What did he do? He accepted Satan's wisdom instead of God's word. Now, couldn't we stop here a while? Sons of God will take a seminary seminar's idea about it instead of the word of God. Same thing indeed. He fulfaded his right. You don't say, "Oh, I need to go and be taught theology." That's not the way to know God. The way to know God, read the word. listen to the word and pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost. And when it did, it went right straight back. When Adam did the book returned, the original owner who gave it out, can you see where those ages has been went? right back again to the original holder. Now, what is redemption? Redemption is not just patching up of the fallen dust man. You understand? Many times when we we we think of redemption, we think of going back to Genesis 2. And we think we're going to remain dusty. Pashed up. Redemption means Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God restores back to his original salt. the blueprint man of Genesis 1, his image, his likeness, his true attribute. That's redemption to with the change of our bodies. This is why Paul said in Colossians 3:10, "And put on the new man, the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him." Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's redemption. putting on a new man after the knowledge after the image of him that created him. The book of redemption is an abstract title deed. If you have ever seen a title deed, it shows the owners. An abstract title did an abstract is different from what did an abstract title did is always searched way back again to the beginning. So all right waiting what is it doing? The book is in the hand. I'm now quoting from the bridge. The hands of God waiting for redemption claims. &gt;&gt; Brother Marvin, while you are seated there, get in the spirit. Preach with me. Amen. By now, I should have had Revelation 5. You see here is the one that is sitting on the throne and in his hand was a book on his hand was a book sealed with seven seals and there was no one whether to take the book of so what is he doing on the throne he's waiting listen church he's waiting for redemption ion claims. He's waiting for somebody to claim the book. Someone who has the ability to bring forth redemption. Someone who can pay the price of redemption. See, he was waiting for him. So, he made a way of redemption. He made a way back and somebody sorry someday the redeemer is to take it back. You see where we are getting to now? We will watch this fellow sitting upon the throne. All right. Waiting for redemption claim. What? Listen church. Now just just listen. What is this book of redemption? This title deed abstract title did you say abstract? What does abstract mean? Means it is searched all the way back to the beginning like that little drop of ink this morning. When it struck that bleach, it went all the way back. And when sin has been confessed and fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ, it gives an abstract right straight back to the creator again. How many of you know bleach? Oh, how is it called? &gt;&gt; You call it jig. &gt;&gt; When you take ink and you put bleach. When you take ink and you power it in jig in bleach, would you see that ink? It disappears. where to where it has gone back again before it was formed until it completely disappeared. Are you following? And he says when a sin has been confessed, it is fallen into the blood of Jesus and that gives an abstract. It is it is go gone back again to this creator again. Sin is not remembered anymore. The moment it falls in the blood. That's why in the beginning we sang the blood. The bleach is the blood. &gt;&gt; You become a son of God. An abstract title deed is held in the hands of the almighty. His redemption means all legal possession to to all that was lost by Adam and Eve. What ought that to do to a born again Christian? [Music] Everything lost. You would have regained them back again. It is redemption. What were they in the beginning? They were in Genesis one in the image of God, but they lost it. They lost it because of the decision of Adam. The recklessness they had is lost. But oh Jesus when he came, he came with what we call the bleach. He was he was a redeemer. He could come and bring back everything that Adam lost. If I were you, &gt;&gt; I would start to order give me what belongs to me &gt;&gt; because you understand Satan has no you are redeemed. You are redeemed back again to the image. You may not be physically but spiritually you are seated in heavenly places with the Christ Jesus. This is the mystery that has now been unveiled. What is the mystery? Christ in you the hope of glory. You can now have the power to claim everything that the devil stole from you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You claim your joy. &gt;&gt; You claim your innocence. [Applause] You claim your marriage. &gt;&gt; You claim your righteousness. You claim your power. You claim your victory. You claim your house. You claim everything. Whatever the devil stole from you as a believer, even before you get to Genesis 1, you have the authority to begin claiming one by one. [Applause] And after that, you tell Satan, "This is just the beginning." [Applause] Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is just the beginning. Soon and very soon, you know what? I don't want to sing. Soon and very soon, we're going to see the king. I want to sing soon and very soon. Soon and very soon, we are going to go back again to our real body. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay, just give me a few minutes. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. On Tuesday, I'm going to Ethiopia. &gt;&gt; And so I'm not preaching on on on on Wednesday. So give me 20 more minutes, guys. Amen. Hallelujah. Can I finish this? Amen. Adam could not meet the requirements of redemption after he found he lost it. He had sinned and he had separated himself from God was on this side of the chasm. So he could not redeem it. He just could not. He needed the redemption himself. He could not even you like Adam could not. But the law required kings man redeemer. The law of God required a kinsman redeemer. And and the prophet says you need to mark that down. Kings man redeemer. Everybody say kings man redeemer. &gt;&gt; Not a stranger, not a friend, a brother. And the devil was jumping and dancing. They don't have anyone. Adam was the only one. Adam was the only one. No one can redeem. Adam was the only one. No one can redeem. He has no kinsman. According to the law of God, he has to have a kinsman. But Adam was the only one. But someone wants to tell the devil there is just about to be a brother Adam is just about &gt;&gt; to have a brother not just a brother. Satan was confused. There is no brother after Adam. All who are born after him are sinners. Before him they are no brothers. Satan did not understand that Adam came from Genesis 1. Before [Music] he came to Genesis 2, did Adam have a brother in Genesis 1? I ask again, did Adam have a brother in Genesis 1? Adam [Laughter] in our image. Hallelujah. [Applause] So there was already a brother. Hallelujah. You and Jesus, me and Jesus, we are both in there. Hallelujah. We are both in there. Satan did not know. We were both in there. &gt;&gt; We had a brother before we were born. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We had a brother. &gt;&gt; Satan did not know &gt;&gt; and even today he doesn't know. But I say we have a brother. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have a doubt, listen to first Corinthians chapter 15 vers 45. This one will shake you up. And so it is written, "The first man was made a living soul." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Is that a man? &gt;&gt; Is that a man? &gt;&gt; Is that a man? &gt;&gt; Okay. The last Adam. &gt;&gt; Wait, please. I'm confused. Pause everything. Let me understand the Bible. You mean there were two Adams created? &gt;&gt; I didn't know. The first Adam was made a living soul. &gt;&gt; But the last Adam, &gt;&gt; which means this second Adam came after the last Adam. &gt;&gt; Are you getting it, brother? &gt;&gt; Listen. This last Adam was made a quickening. &gt;&gt; The first one was a a living soul. But the second Adam was not just a soul was a spirit. What were you in the beginning? You were a spirit. Hallelujah. A spirit man. Let us create man in our image. Oh, God created man in his own image. Who was God? A spirit. So, who is the second Adam? A spirit, not just a spirit. A spirit that quickens. [Applause] Hallelujah. Listen. When in when when Adam became a living soul, it was after it was after the quickening spirit had been put in him by God that quickenth. Now I'm confused. is the second Adam, my brother or the very God that made me come into the voice over because I'm confused. I need to understand this is the second Adam. The God that created the first Adam or just a brother. He was both. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How b that that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that was spiritual. The first man is of the earth. The second man the second man. The second man is the Lord from heaven. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The second what does does language have meaning anymore? The second what man. Who is God? God is a second man. The second man was our quickening. The second what man. Please say it so you can get it. &gt;&gt; The second what was a quickening spirit who was the Lord from heaven. [Applause] In simple terms, the Lord from heaven, the quickening spirit became a man. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word. &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, give me that verse. &gt;&gt; John one. In the beginning was the word and the word was &gt;&gt; with God. And the word was the same was in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Give me the next verse quickly. Quickly. Go. Go behind. Go behind. Go behind, brother. Go behind. Verse three. Listen. Read with me. All things wait. Read again. All feelings. &gt;&gt; Okay. Go behind. Go behind. Oh, go back again. &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the And the word was And the word was okay. Don't worry. You'll get it. Vers two. The same who who the word who was in the beginning with God. Okay. Verse three. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. All things all read with me were made by him. &gt;&gt; Who? &gt;&gt; God. who is &gt;&gt; the And without him, &gt;&gt; without him was not anything made that was. Amen. Whether there be thrones, whe there be kings, whether it be heaven, whether it be earth, whether it be hell, whatever was made, there was nothing made that was made. without the world making it. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. Give me verses 14. &gt;&gt; And the word was made. And the word was flesh. &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for you to think. &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh. Who was made flesh? Who is the word? God. &gt;&gt; Okay. Can you now read it again? And God was made. [Music] &gt;&gt; Satan must be confused. [Laughter] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I feel like shouting. God was made flesh and dwelt among us. Hallelujah. And we beheld his glory, the glory of the only begotten of the father, &gt;&gt; full of grace and truth. [Music] [Applause] So the word was begotten &gt;&gt; by the father. Amen. So what does it mean? It means Jesus is called the second Adam because he was begotten. &gt;&gt; Just like Adam in the beginning was begotten. So that's why he's our brother. That's why there is nothing like eternal son. God the father, God the son. rubbish. Check your Bible. Those words are not there. There is nothing like God the Son. He's only the son who is a manifestation of the father and he had a beginning of his office and the end. Sons begin and end. But God has no beginning. You are about to see something here. This God put on flesh and he called it the son. But actually it is actually words like a meaning. It is God himself [Applause] coming &gt;&gt; into the flesh. [Music] They call him the son, son of Mary. He's more than son of Mary. He's God himself tabernacle in man. Philippians chapter 2. Let this mind be brother quickly. Let this mind be as it was in Christ Jesus. Who? Who? Jesus. Yes. &gt;&gt; Being in the form of God. &gt;&gt; Thought it not rob to be equal with God. &gt;&gt; Exactly. You said it right. &gt;&gt; Wait, church. I'm coming to the climax very soon. He was in the form of God, but he never made himself even equal with God. Give me the next verse. But made himself of no reputation. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Check your Bible quickly. John 1:14 said what? Please church tell me the word was brother we are still here don't go away don't go away don't go away the word was who made it but made himself hallelujah of no reputation he was god He made himself of no reputation, and he took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men, being found in a fashion as a man. Come on. Come on. Continue. Continue, brother. Hallelujah. Vers 8. where I forgot no no and being found in a fashion as a man, he humbled himself in and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross. So who was it? It was God who made himself of no reputation and he came and he died. What was he doing? She was proving a point. She was proving a point that I am here to redeem everything that was a part of me in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Man was in my image, I must redeem him. Whatever it takes, I am going to do it. If it takes me to become a man, I am going to become a man. If it takes me to lose my reputation, I will do it. I must come down. I cannot leave part of me to be destroyed. That's why Adam did what he did because he knew the blueprint. He knew the blueprint. Everything must go according to plan. Brother, do you have that little picture which I sent on the media team group? You did not get it. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Try to get it if you can. See, I wanted to show you a little image so you can understand. Genesis 1, the blueprint man in the image and likeness of God. Don't you worry about brother M. I never told him. He's just there. If he gets it, he gets it. If he doesn't get it, no problem. Let's just continue here cuz I want to reach the climax and finish. So man Genesis one blueprint man was in the image and likeness of God Genesis 2 he was a vessel man formed from dust living so then we see the fall coming man losing dominion Genesis 3 then we see Revelation 5 &gt;&gt; you see how it jumps from beginning to redemption through Christ. Quickening spirit, restoration to the blueprint back again to the Genesis one. He was the quickening spirit, the creator himself coming down to redeem his blueprint. and he said, "Oh, the father has given me." Hallelujah. He knew them. No man can cast them from my hand. Amen. I will raise him up at the last day. But as many as have received him, to them gave him power to become the sons of God. That is true spiritual adoption. given unto them that believe on his name, which were born, which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but the will of God. Now let me stand here and reaffirm. I have received him and therefore I'm a son of God. I have believed on his name. I am not born of blood. I am not born of flesh. I am not born of the will of man. I am born of the will of God. according as he has chosen me in him before the foundation of the world that I should be holy. You see now holiness. Genesis 1 that I should be holy and without blazer before him in love having predestinated me and to adoption of children of a child by Jesus Christ to himself. Now listen to this part my brother. according to the good pleasure of his his will. Whether you want or not. Hallelujah. Whether the devil want to go, it is not your will. It is not my will. He said, "All of mine, all of them will get lost. They're in my hands." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; According to the pleasure of my will, who loved you to get saved all your way. Hallelujah. He loved it. For you're his brother. &gt;&gt; He died for you. He must restore and bring you back. Hallelujah. The bride has an eternal part in him. I was remaining with one quote, but I'm not going to read it. But let me just say this. Amen. The blood of Jesus that has been redeemed back to the blueprint has an eternal path that cannot be destroyed. When we preach the word and we hear the word and we receive the word, we hear from our the [Applause] body Let me read the scripture as we finish. There is a body that we are waiting to enter in. There is another body. Hallelujah. 1 second Corinthians 5. For we know rather quickly. For we know that if our earthly house of this tur dissolved, &gt;&gt; we have a building of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have a building of God. We have a building of God. Hallelujah. Amen. Even if your father has no house, help me to finish this. Even if your father has no house, even if your home have never owned a house, let me tell you, there is a building of God. Jesus said, "I go to prepare a house. There is a mansion. There's a building. Every one of you has [Applause] in my father's house. How many mansion I go to prepare a place for you. What is that place? What is that building? &gt;&gt; What is that house? &gt;&gt; That is your spiritual body. Jesus, &gt;&gt; yes. &gt;&gt; Jesus was not a living soul because he was a spirit that gives life. There's a part which I didn't go to. Let me try to summarize everything right now. Jesus who has a spirit which gives life that Jesus never bypass his spiritual body. He was born as the word. Amen. He came first then flesh then back again. Now listen listen I'm trying to close so help me close now. Jesus when he came in this tent, &gt;&gt; the only reason Oh, thank you Jesus. The only reason why he was not defeated is because he never he never bypasses theophony because everyone in the flesh must be tempted and defeated. Jesus only was the one who came in the flesh and was tempted. All right, Adam of Genesis 2. But he, Jesus, the second Adam was not defeated. &gt;&gt; Why? because he was the Lord from heaven. Because he was the quickening spirit. And when we say we are going to be redeemed, it's not just to Genesis 2 because Genesis 2 still you can still fall. You have your own will. Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but we are being taken all the way back &gt;&gt; to a place where you will not have a a a a will that is different from the father today as a believer when you receive the word and believe the word and receive the Holy Ghost even when you are in this flesh. You become Genesis 2 man. But even then you will fight. You will fight. But each time you are saying let your will be done. Let your will be done. Meaning you have a will. You have a will but the will of the father is in you. So you are fighting. You are fighting. You're trying to do good. Evil is around you because of the flesh, because of your will. Your greatest enemy is the flesh. But brother, sister, we must fight. We must fight because the Holy Ghost which has been given to us is the earnest. And you cannot overcome if you don't have the Holy Spirit. You must be baptized with the Holy Spirit. It is the power to help you fight. Without the Holy Ghost, every little bit temptation will protect you. But when you have the Holy Ghost, you will fight on sometimes. Things can go wrong. But still in the ring fighting and one of these days the honors which you have been given the full payment will come. Oh hallelujah. We have a house tabernacle building of God. Not men with hands. Hallelujah. Not according to dust man of Genesis 2 of Genesis 1, not with eternal in the heavens. In this we grown honestly desiring desiring to be closed with our house which is from heaven. If so be that being closed we shall not be found naked. For we that are in this tabernacle do grown being burdened, not for that we would be uncloed, but we want to be clothed that mortality, mortality might be swallowed up of life. Now he has wrote us For the selfs same thing is God who also has given us the unness of he is the one who has put us the earnest to confirm we must finish this. Hallelujah. Therefore, we are always confident knowing that while we are at home in this body, we are absent from the Lord. But we walk by faith, not by sight. We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord. Whereof we labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him. There are two ways we can make it. We can go by the way of the grave. Those who die. The Bible says in Thessalonians they will rise up again. Do you know what they will do? When they rise, you know when they die they get their fear for the body. But when they they they they on the resurrection morning, they'll come back again here on the earth to pick their glorified body. Why? Because corruptible has to put on incorruption. Are you following me? Oh my. When Jesus died and went to the grave and he rose, the body did not remain there. What happened? That body dressed another body and the other body dissolved and Jesus had a glorified body. Let me tell you, those who die in Christ shall rise fast and they will be also clothed with a glorified body. And we which are alive and remain, let me tell you brother, this one is going to dissolve. So the quickening power that is in us is going to quicken us and change us and we shall put on corruption. [Music] [Applause] will be glorified. We can appear and disappear. We can eat food like Jesus. Hallelujah. We will be here in a millennia. What are you talking about? Hallelujah. We are redeemed. I can almost preach for the whole day. Friends, I thank you. I thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. We are redeemed. Let us stand our feet saints. Give him a clap of praise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Soon we shall have our redeemed bodies. Corruption will put on incorruption, no more temptation, no more worries, no more sin, no more poverty, no more problems. the scholars, no more books, [Music] no more jobs to do. Everything will be done. But for now, if you have not received the Holy Ghost, you need to receive the Holy Ghost because you are you have left you are left behind. If you don't have the Holy Ghost, you can't receive the final pay. You can't receive the full redemption. The Holy Spirit is your redemption as an earnest. How do you receive the Holy Spirit? Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of God. And when you do that, your sins will be washed away and he will fill you with the Holy Spirit. If he's still filled, I'm baptized. I I I I can't say I have received the Holy Spirit. Wow. He cannot lie. Whatever God says is true. So you have to receive the Holy Spirit. You must receive the voice. As simple as that. And what do you why need you to do? Ask &gt;&gt; and he shall receive. Knock and it shall be offered. Be hungry for him. In your heart the Lord Jesus. Lift up your hand and say Lord. You know it can even happen now. You lift up your hands and say, "Lord, feel me." Now, the Holy Spirit is not God doing something for you because he's giving you a reward. It is a promise which he promised to all as an earnest of their redemption. And when you are ready, he's ready. He was ready before you were ready. I remember even when you received the Holy Spirit, you are still in this tabernacle. But then you need him to fight. So since I was baptized, there's been battles. That's a sign. Something is happening in the battle increased. The fighting has been intense. That's a sign that you have now entered the ring only by the Holy Ghost. You will overcome. You will overcome. You have to fight to reign. Praise God. Don't you feel lovely? Close your eyes everybody. The Holy Spirit is here now. He can prove to you what I just preached to you. So you as an individual, you can receive a surge of the power of the Holy Spirit, he can fill you. And I want you to imagine is he not able to fulfill his word. So what is the Holy Spirit? It is the supernatural life of God. part of your theology of part of the work being made alive in you so that you can be able to exercise your free will by his guidance and when he comes in you just like a baby chs and shouts you know you you will have an emotion that's why you feel the way you Some of you even as I'm speaking right now, something is happening in your life. Something is happening in your life. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Wow. Amen. I can only say it because it has been revealed to me. Praise God. Look, just lift up your hands and say, Lord, feel me now. your power. That's the power to live for him in this world which is sin stricken. We can't do it without him more than anything. You need that honesty and he is here to give you that down payment. You see, you don't have to mind about anybody who is around you. Your battles are yours. because you know and you might as well fight this one and not lose this one and say Lord I I this is my moment. It's my time. I need to be filled. I need to be filled with the earnest of your power that I may be able to fight and I be able to win. [Music] You may have been filled before when he can he can he can refuse. You see where you what you received where it came from there is much more. You can never finish God. He overflows. Let him fill your cup and then let your soul overflow with his spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You young people, some of you cannot overcome without it. You need the Holy Spirit. Think about the battle you're fighting. How can you make it without you? Tell him, "Lord Jesus, I am desperate for you. I fill you now. Feel me now." That's the only prayer you can pray right now. That way, it will be granted. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You have to be desperate for him. You cannot do it. If you have hazard, you are not letting go. You are not letting loose. You are still in your own little world. You need to be free because the Holy Ghost is a spirit of God that goes off and beyond your humanity. So you have to let your humanity down. If the Lord of heaven can humble himself to a form of a how about you today? Can't you humble yourself and ask him to feel you? Can't you accept me vulnerable? I I don't even know what I'm doing. I believe it is him him pulling for you. So, don't let don't don't let it pass by you. You may say, "Well, I'm a sinner. I'm a big time sinner. I've done a lot of things." Come on, sister. Come on, brother. That's the reason I'm asking you to receive the Holy Ghost. You too can receive. Because when you receive the Holy Ghost, the things that overcame you before will not by any means overcome you again because you will have the power to overcome. Receive you the Holy Ghost. Receive you the Holy Ghost right now in the name of Jesus Christ. Lift up your hands and receive him. &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow. Right now, not tomorrow, right now. &gt;&gt; Believe him. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Jesus. Oh yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Refill me now, Lord. &gt;&gt; Refill me now, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah, Lord. Refill me now, Lord Jesus.
