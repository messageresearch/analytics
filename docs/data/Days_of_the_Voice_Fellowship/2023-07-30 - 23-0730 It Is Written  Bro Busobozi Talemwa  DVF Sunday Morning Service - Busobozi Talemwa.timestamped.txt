[1:19:10] the Son of God command this stone that
[1:19:12] it should that it may be made bread
[1:19:21] and Jesus answered and him saying it is
[1:19:24] written that man shall not live by bread
[1:19:27] alone but by every word of God yes
[1:19:38] and the devil taking him up into an eye
[1:19:41] Mountain showed unto him all the
[1:19:44] kingdoms of the world in a moment of
[1:19:47] time and the devil said unto him all
[1:19:49] this power will I give thee and the
[1:19:51] glory of them for that is delivered unto
[1:19:54] me and to whomsoever I will give it and

[1:21:31] [Music]
[1:21:46] and when the devil had ended

[1:21:53] for a season
[1:21:55] Jesus returned in the power of the of

[1:22:49] accomplish it
[1:22:53] [Music]
[1:22:54] and and today I want to speak to you on
[1:22:58] it is written
[1:23:02] why
[1:23:05] tell your neighbor it is written
[1:23:09] tell to people it is
[1:23:13] all right you told one or two it is
[1:23:17] written it is written
[1:23:20] that's just what we want to talk about
[1:23:22] this morning
[1:23:23] and just before I forget we have a
[1:23:26] meeting with the committee that is
[1:23:27] arranging the youth meetings for January
[1:23:32] [Music]
[1:23:34] right after the service
[1:23:37] and then we I also have other things I
[1:23:41] want to discuss with them about
[1:23:44] so it is written what is written
[1:23:49] Luke chapter 4 is one of the most
[1:23:51] powerful scriptures
[1:23:56] because it shows us how to overcome
[1:23:59] certain
[1:24:00] ingredient
[1:24:01] did you know that the moment you were
[1:24:04] born into this world you started a
[1:24:06] battle with Saturn
[1:24:11] we go without knowing
[1:24:57] but you know you are fighting and you
[1:25:00] want to overcome but it seems as if it
[1:25:01] is impossible for you to overcome
[1:25:06] and you are fighting you've been
[1:25:08] fighting ever since you you know you you
[1:25:10] you you came to the edge of
[1:25:12] accountability
[1:25:13] foreign
[1:25:46] [Music]
[1:26:13] is uh two laws working in me
[1:26:17] so this one is walking inside of me
[1:26:21] another one is Walking In My Flesh
[1:26:25] and both these are against one another
[1:26:29] it's a battle the battle that we are
[1:26:32] fighting we don't want to do bad but you
[1:26:35] find yourself doing bad
[1:26:39] you want to do what God says or you to
[1:26:42] please the Lord but you find yourself
[1:26:43] doing the wrong things
[1:26:48] so you are confused to come to that
[1:26:52] place whereby you cry out not to come on
[1:26:56] how will I overcome
[1:26:59] I want to be well and many people make
[1:27:03] decorations
[1:27:05] especially when the year is about to
[1:27:07] start
[1:27:10] from today
[1:27:13] you know by the time the first hour
[1:27:16] finds me
[1:27:21] I am no longer going to do this to even
[1:27:24] get books and they write the things
[1:27:29] I am making a resolution
[1:27:31] I am signing my name on this
[1:27:36] I'm no longer Furniture
[1:27:49] passes
[1:27:52] [Music]
[1:27:59] because it is
[1:28:06] not your decision to say I will not do
[1:28:09] this
[1:28:11] the Bible says not by power Hallelujah
[1:28:44] it is written
[1:28:46] this is a very good way
[1:28:49] of knowing how to overcome
[1:28:53] today I'm going to give you one clue
[1:29:00] the best one
[1:29:03] how to overcome the devil
[1:29:07] or unless you're not fighting against
[1:29:13] oh you're fighting every one of us
[1:29:16] you're fighting in your life if you're
[1:29:19] married you're fighting in your marriage
[1:29:21] you're fighting in your business you're
[1:29:25] fighting in your education
[1:29:27] you want to be the best
[1:29:31] certain things
[1:29:36] but it feels as if it is impossible
[1:29:39] the reason because people we try to do
[1:29:43] it on our own
[1:29:44] foreign
[1:30:22] and we are going to read there from
[1:30:25] verses
[1:30:27] seven
[1:30:28] um seven years
[1:30:38] and I request you to have as little
[1:30:40] movement as possible please
[1:30:44] [Music]
[1:30:46] help me if you have to um
[1:30:50] amen so we're looking at Revelation 12
[1:30:55] foreign
[1:31:29] this was the first war to be fought
[1:31:34] God the Bible doesn't tell us when God
[1:31:37] is creating angels
[1:31:40] and the Bible tells us God created
[1:31:43] angels
[1:31:46] that you can find when you open the
[1:31:47] moment you open your Bible in Genesis
[1:31:49] chapter one
[1:31:52] The Bible says God was already God
[1:31:56] in the beginning what does it say
[1:31:59] foreign
[1:32:12] foreign
[1:32:29] [Music]
[1:33:19] does anybody know what God means
[1:33:22] what does it means
[1:33:25] object of worship
[1:33:28] that's why he says Thou shalt not have
[1:33:31] other gods before
[1:33:34] so what is a god a God is something that
[1:33:38] you Worship
[1:33:40] in African tradition we used to have you
[1:33:43] know to worship trees
[1:33:52] the big tree with big buttressed Roots
[1:33:58] people think oh that is it's a goddess
[1:34:02] and you know we go there in there and we
[1:34:04] worship and we put money and you know he
[1:34:06] she gives us blessings
[1:34:09] together
[1:34:11] and you know they go there and they
[1:34:13] claim oh it works for us
[1:34:16] when you go to India they also have
[1:34:19] their own Idols
[1:34:21] when you go to some Churches they also
[1:34:23] have their idols
[1:34:25] foreign
[1:35:01] [Music]
[1:35:22] [Applause]
[1:35:25] foreign
[1:35:36] [Music]
[1:36:16] [Applause]
[1:36:26] himself alone
[1:36:28] no one worshiped him he has a fellowship
[1:36:32] with anybody or anything
[1:36:36] he was the Elohim Yari hello
[1:36:43] to have something to worship Him
[1:36:47] He created angels
[1:36:50] now this was before the beginning of
[1:36:53] Genesis 1 1.
[1:36:57] the Bible doesn't give us the account of
[1:37:01] the creation of angels
[1:37:05] but we are able to know by other
[1:37:07] scriptures that Angels were created by
[1:37:10] God
[1:37:13] and also we are able to know by other
[1:37:16] scriptures that in heaven Angels worship
[1:37:18] God every day
[1:37:23] they say holy holy
[1:37:38] those are the Angels now and so we find
[1:37:42] out the Lucifer Lucifer was one of the
[1:37:46] chief most angels in heaven
[1:37:50] if you if you want to rank him he might
[1:37:52] have been one of the maybe a four or
[1:37:54] five star general
[1:37:56] yeah
[1:37:59] and it was great as a matter of fact you
[1:38:03] might not know but Lucifer was the one
[1:38:05] leading all the music in heaven
[1:38:09] Lucifer area
[1:38:12] he was greatly blessed
[1:38:15] with a nice voice
[1:38:49] [Music]
[1:39:19] I have many angels who are even
[1:39:22] listening to me
[1:39:23] I can send them
[1:39:29] [Music]
[1:39:43] [Applause]
[1:39:58] [Applause]
[1:40:23] was sent to God foreign
[1:41:11] so don't yes we are human beings
[1:41:16] so we can we understand it in a physical
[1:41:18] way
[1:41:20] and it's all right for you to draw an
[1:41:22] image
[1:41:24] I want you to understand
[1:41:26] these were Spirits you're not human
[1:41:29] beings
[1:41:31] but they as Angels they also have their
[1:41:34] own Angelic spiritual bodies
[1:41:41] let us see what the Bible says verse
[1:41:45] seven and there was war in heaven
[1:41:47] Michael and his angels fought against
[1:41:49] the dragon and the dragon fought and his
[1:41:52] angels
[1:41:57] so the Bible calls Lucifer here now at
[1:42:00] Dragon when a Bible
[1:42:03] also calls him other names
[1:42:06] in verse 9 it says
[1:42:10] verse it says and prevailed not neither
[1:42:12] was their place found any more in heaven
[1:42:14] and the Great Dragon was cast out that
[1:42:17] old serpent called the devil and Saturn
[1:42:21] which deceiveth the whole world and he
[1:42:23] was cast out into the Earth and his
[1:42:25] angels were cast out with him
[1:42:47] praise the name of the Lord oh my glory
[1:42:51] to God
[1:42:52] this should make me and my soul excited
[1:42:57] that no one can stand against the king
[1:43:03] Our God cannot be defeated he's The
[1:43:08] Undefeated champion
[1:43:15] the Bible says Lucifer was overcome
[1:43:19] and he was kicked out of heaven and all
[1:43:23] these other Angels they were kicked out
[1:43:26] of heaven so today later we no longer
[1:43:30] not Lucifer as Lucifer Lucifer Lucifer
[1:43:33] Lucifer is a beautiful name luciferina
[1:43:36] do you know what Lucifer
[1:43:40] of the morning
