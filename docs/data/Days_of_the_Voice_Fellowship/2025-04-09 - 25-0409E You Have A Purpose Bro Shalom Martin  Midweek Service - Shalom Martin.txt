Praise be to God. Shall we turn to our Bible this evening and read with me in Romans. uh Romans chapter 8, no chapter n shall read from vers three. Shall we read in the name of the Lord? For I could wish that my soul were a cast uh a cast from Christ for my brethren uh my kinsmen according to the flesh who are Israelite to whom pertainth the adoption and the glory and the covenant and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promise. Who uh whose uh the father and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed forever. Amen. Not as though the word of God hath taken not none effect for they are not all for for they are not all Israel which are of Israel. Neither because they are seed of Abraham are they all children. But in Isaac shall uh shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh. These are not the children of God but the children of uh but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. For this is the word uh this the word of this the word of promise. At this time will I come and Sarah have a son. And not only this, but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac, for the children were not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth. [Music] Crystal. [Music] to attend. And there is a way. Amen. forchech. [Music] [Music] [Music] Amen. Not of works, but of whom who calls. Amen. Amen. And I will call my sharing tonight. You have a purpose. You have a purpose. Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name of God. Praise be to God. And that purpose cannot be defeated. Lord Jesus, we thank you for the portion of the scripture we have read and for other scriptures. Lord, I pray that you come take me out of the way. And Lord, may you take the bread of life and break it for us. Remember one time in the Bible he closed the mouth of lion. May you come tonight and separate me from my mind and may the mind of Christ be echoed to your church. May you close my mouth from my own words and may the Holy Spirit take the full prayer in Christ Jesus name. Amen. May be seated. Praise be to God. Amen. When I was told this uh morning that I would stand this evening I was wondering what I would share with you. Blessed be the name of God. But as I was in prayer praying, something came in my mind and I started looking at my life. Praise be to God. the things that I've gone through and indeed I realized it was not me. Blessed be the name. Praise be to God. But it's because God has a purpose in my life and the same thing apply to you. God called us in this journey. This journey has never been easy. Praise be to God. And I trust you know what I'm talking about. It will never be easy until rapture. Praise be to God. Christianity is all about battles. It's all about fighting the Lord's fight. Praise be to God. And the devil has a reason to fight. That's why he's fighting you night and day. The devil knows where he came from. Praise be to God. And he has full reason to hinder you. And let me tell you my brother and my sister, the devil will fight you until the end. Praise be to God. Amen. But each time we know that we have a purpose and God called us before the foundation of God. Amen. That gives us a reason to stand. The Bible says resist the devil and the devil will flee. Amen. The devil will not stay. As long as you resist to him, he will have to go. He says, "Submit yourself to the Lord. Draw near unto him and he will also draw near unto you." Praise be to God. Amen. Amen. And where we read, the Bible showed us that before Jacob and before Essa and Jacob were born, God loved one and he hated the other one. Before they were still innocent, blessed be the name of the Lord. But God being infinite he look through eternity. Praise be to God. He looked these two children and he put them on weighing scale and he show them praise be to God and God knew that Esau would not take birthight as something important but Jacob would even die for it. Praise be to God. And because of that, God said, God said, "I love Jacob and Israel. Blessed be the name of the Lord." God looked at the purpose in the life of God. Praise be to God. What keeps us moving in this journey? the purpose of God about our life as a reason why we are here. Amen. And that's what fuel us every single day and when we are beaten when we are cast down. Amen. Amen. Amen. But there is something within you, that pushes you that encourages you to rise and move again. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. If you look at yourself here tonight, you are not the only child in your family, but you realize you're the only believer in your family. Because God had a purpose in your life and that's why God called you out of your family. That's why you are seated here tonight because there is a reason and that purpose nothing can defeat you. There's no that can put that down. There's no challenge that can put down and there's no way you will ever give up. Praise be to God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Look at Abraham's calling. Genesis 17. After the intervian world, blessed be the name of the Lord. God looked into the whole world and saw man Abraham who was atheisted with the name of the Lord. The man who worship uh cre creation instead of the creator. The man was a moon worshipper. But one day God visited Abraham and told him to leave his country to leave his kindred to go to the land he was taking him. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Abraham had not done anything good by the grace of God. Grace found him. The grace called him. Praise be to God. That same grace is what called us. Grace is what what is keeping us moving. Praise be to God. I think Abraham was not discouraged somewhere. He must have reached somewhere alongside the way and he was not seeing the land which God spoke about. He was not seeing that promise. Praise be to God. But each time Abraham remember that this God who called me, he has a reason the purpose of my calling. Amen. He kept on moving. Blessed be the name of the Lord. If you look at God's election, it's amazing. Of all the women of the world, God called Sarah. Sarah, who was even buried, blessed be the name of the Lord. There was a purpose in her life. God's calling has a purpose. Praise be to God. God does not call us just for granted. Tell your neighbor you have a purpose. Tell that brother you have a purpose. Amen. I have a purpose. The devil knows that we have a purpose and that purpose must be achieved. purpose must be accomplished no matter what comes our way. Praise be to God. Amen. When God called Paul and one day they are in the ship. Amen. And the ship wrecked blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Remember before before they started that journey a man called he came and prophesy over Paul raise me to God and told him not to go but Paul never obeyed him. Praise the Lord and Paul started their journey. when they reach in the middle of the sea to shipwreck because God had a purpose in Paul's life. Nothing bad defeated him. Praise be to God. I'm here to tell you my brother, my sister, I just want us to encourage ourselves in that there is a purpose in our life. Amen. Amen. And that purpose cannot be denied when you look at the mystery of birth. What happened when you were born? Amen. That you managed to reach the finishing line out of the million jam of [Music] life which came from your father. But you are the only one. who made it and the rest died. Praise be to God. And the devil make us think that we are just defeated people. We know what we are talking about. And we know where we are going. Amen. Amen. We have a vision. Praise be to God. We have a promise. We are people of the covenant. We are covenant people. And there's no way we can be defeated. Praise be to God. When I'm here to encourage you, we are going to make it. No matter what comes our way, we are called by God. We are chosen by God. We are ordained by God. We are guided by God. Praise be to God. Amen. When God looked through eternity, he knew that there would be confusion. Praise be to God. Amen. But still, he never left us alone. When he looked at many false doctrines, many false preachers. Amen. Amen. God in his mind, in his preparation, as he said in Jeremiah chapter 29:11, I know the thought I have toward. I have a thought of peace, not of evil to bring you to an expected end where you did not even expect to be. That's where what God has prepared for you. And he looked at this generation and his purpose in our life. Praise be to God. Amidst this confusion, he sent us the prophet and is guiding us by his eye, the eye of the prophet. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And that's what we are following. Praise be to God. You have a purpose today. We have a purpose that cannot be defeated. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. We are called for a greater purpose. Not something minor but a greater purpose. Amen. Amen. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. Amen. And by faith we are going to make it. Whether the devil like it or not, we are going to make it. Amen. Amen. Because we know God's purpose cannot be. And we shall read in Hebrews 11. And we see men and women who had purpose in their lives. What they went through, but still God's purpose stood and prevailed. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Yes sir. Hallelujah. Glory. We are not going to die premature. We are going to be raptured. Amen. Amen. If the Lord tries, we shall rather we rather sleep. Hallelujah. Through the old age. Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. But if the Lord comes first, we are going to be raptured. And that is the purpose of God. Praise be to God. God has a bride. You are that bride. Blessed be the name of the Lord. The devil try through the ages can put down that. Amen. Amen. But that bubbas cannot be defeated. Amen. Amen. Praise be to God. That's what is pushing us every day. And that's what the devil has failed to understand. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. that even when he comes and tries you, when he comes and put you down, still because something holds you. Amen. There is a purpose why we are here. And deep in our souls, in our hearts, we we also know there are things you have gone through. You've gone through thick and thin, but you also don't know how you managed to overcome. You can't even explain. But it's because of the purpose of God. Praise be to God. Remember I was told when I was young uh my mother nearly almost died. Blessed be the name of the Lord. I was just of months and when they tell you the story you get emotional and even cry but now I know why God preserved my life. It's because God has a reason. It's because we are holding something so precious and that thing cannot die premature. Hallelujah. It must reach the harvest time. Amen. Praise be to God. And I thank God that today he has given me that grace that we are also giving the devil hard time. He wanted to take advantage when we were young. Blessed be the name of the Lord. You know there are many things which happen when children are being born. Some queer things. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. But I thank God that evening. Amen. When I was being born, my angel was there. He was guarding me because he knew. Praise be to God. There is a purpose. There's God's purpose in my life. And he knew that when I get off, I will stand. I will choose serve the Lord in this wicked generation. Praise be to God. The same angel. The same angel of the Lord which protected Moses when he was sailing on the rear on river N. same angel protected you when you were born before you were born. He was there on God. Praise be to God. Amen. Maybe your mother had some some kind of sickness and that womb almost came out and the devil tried whatever he could. But it's time the devil tried. The angel of the Lord say it will not come out until you were born. And when you were born, still the devil tried by taking you in sin by doing this and that. But that same angel, he has protected you until today because the purpose of God cannot be defeated. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. The seed of God dwells in us, brother, sister. This is the time. It is your turn. The other time it was the devil's turn. Praise be to God. But now it is your turn because then you did not know right from wrong. You are living in sin like others. You are abusing like others. You are of sin like others. Hallelujah. But now it is different story. Now it is different story. Amen. You will decide by your soul to serve the devil to live unclean life. Blessed be the name of the Lord. But one thing I want to tell you tonight. This is the time to revenge against your enemy. because now you know that there you have a purpose in your life and as long as we live that purpose cannot be the chicken. Hallelujah. Amen. That is what keeps me going. I've been struck by many problems. Challenges come. They come and go. Trouble comes and go. Hallelujah. Sometime it comes and attack the whole family. But the grace of God has never fail us. Every time the devil comes like the spirit of the Lord always. Hallelujah. Amen. And that makes me to know you have a [Music] purpose. Hallelujah. Even my children, they will live to serve the Lord. Praise be to God. And I know that devil will try whatever he will try to stress us. He will try to trouble my family. But I stand and speak like Joshua. I and my family, I and my house, we shall serve the Lord, all the days of our lives. And this is a time for you to make a resolution to make a stand for the Lord and say, I and my family in my youthful age, I will shout the Lord. All the days of my life, blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Praise be to God. There is two thing going on in the world today. Because remember the two seed which came from Eden. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Praise be to God. We thank God for Jesus Christ. We thank God for electing us. The Bible say before they even did any wrong, he loved one and hated her. Blessed be the name of the Lord. When God looked into the life of Jacob, he saw his resilience. Praise be to God. And I believe God's smile. Say, "Wow." Yeah. This praise be to God. Say, "Yeah, I I love his spirit. Praise be to God. And no wonder when they were born. This boy was [Music] restless. He knew very well that the Lord says the birthight was for the first born. Blessed be the name of. and he was looking for how he would steal that birthday. He knew that he had a purpose in his life. Praise be to God. Look at man like Abraham. Maybe it was an evening. He was there worshiping the moon. He's worshiping the moon. Maybe giving the sacrifice. And all of a sudden the scene changed. Amen. And here God called him for the first time. God spoke to him. Hallelujah. The moon could not speak. But that day he had a voice of God. Blessed be the name of the Lord. No matter what situation you are into, God, if you're a child of God, God will speak to you. God will give you direction. Blessed be the name of the Lord. He will give you direction. He will guide you. Praise be to God. Let us be like the Israel because we are the spiritual Israel. I was reading in the morning when the king saw that Elijah was Elishah was about to die. He went to him and inquired about their future. Blessed be the name of the Lord about their enemy. Praise be to God. He asked the king. He asked the the prophet. I have come to inquire. I've seen your sicknesses unto death. Praise be to God because God spoke through his prophet. The word of God comes to the prophets. So the king knew that when this man is gone, they are going to be in darkness. And he inquired from him and ask him, I've come to inquire about our future with Assyrians. Blessed be the name of And the prophet told him, "Get an arrow. Praise the Lord. And shoot. Hallelujah. And the king did so. And he asked him how many times had shot the the praise be to God. And the king told him three times. They said, "What have you [Music] done?" When God gives you opportunity, utilize it. Utilize it thoroughly. Because that chance might not come again. And the king spoke and the prophet spoke to the king and told him, "You will only fit them three times. Blessed be the name of the Lord." And up to today, there is still war in Middle East. Middle East because the king shot the arrow only three times. Blessed be the name of the Lord.

You speak to this body. You speak to your heart and you speak to yourself and say my heart be of good courage. [Music] Man knows what I'm talking about. Sometime you are pressed until you say what can I do but the Holy Ghost remind you can do something. Then you start speaking to yourself and you say no matter what is happening around me I am moving forward I'm not giving up. I'm not going to do that because the Lord has it me out of this. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. But when you hear believers saying, "The way I'm so stressed, anybody should commit suicide." Praise the Lord. And even if you hold on when you are trick for me others they are okay. God will just look at you say look at this one with ammonia. Praise be to God. Even the people in the world they are stressed. They even have more trouble and they have nowhere to run to. Praise be to God. Yesterday one man was telling me that they came and stole his screen. So a friend told him there is a man I know.

And the Holy Ghost, the law enforcer went and convicted the thief and the guy drove the car. Hallelujah. Amen. And parked it somewhere and took off. And I remembered I remembered sister Ro's testimony on Sunday when her phone was stolen. The other one went to the witch doctor. The witch doctor is too weak to go and look for it. He has to send a creation. He has to send a be. But our sister prayed and believed God. And the thief brought back the phone. That is the God we are talking about. Hallelujah. This is not just a story. There is a living God in heaven. And that God is in our midst. Hallelujah. Amen. That God who speaks to our body and the sickness flee. God speaks to our problem disappear. The God who make the lamb to work. Hallelujah. And that is the God who called us with a holy calling. You are not on a guest work. You are here for a special duty. We are evil delegates. Hallelujah.

Then sent men on earth. He sent men on earth. Then he say, "Therefore go into the world, preach the gospel. Whosoever believes and baptize, hallelujah, there are men on earth." There are men today who are living in sin whom the devils made them to think that they of this world because they walk like others. They go to market like others. They eat like others, sleep by like others. And they think they're like others. Praise be to God. But God chose you and me and sent us on earth to tell them that they are not like others. Amen. that they are eager. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And by the way, eagles does not walk but they jump jump because when they walk like this be that they have the clothes they going to they will be holding grass around. Blessed be the name of we thank God. Hallelujah. Sometime even you lack what to say. Amen. There is something in your heart like Daniel of old who say I will not bow down because he knew the purpose he had. That's all we need to know because we'll stay focused to know that we have a purpose and there is God driving this and that cannot fail. Abraham old man because there is purpose there was a purpose in his life at his old age. God revived him. God renewed his strength. God restored Sarah's womb. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Things may be hard today, but when the purpose is about to be accomplished, something is got to happen. And the devil cannot reverse it because it is God doing it. Hallelujah. Why does it take long? God follows the law of nature. That is his law. You can plant maze today and harvest tomorrow. But when you plant, you'll have to prune it. You'll have to weed it until the harvest time.

He became sick and Jesus had about he had of his sickness but he never went there because Jesus knew that had a purpose. Amen. And what was that purpose? He was going to demonstrate resurrection. The voice of resurrection. Hallelujah. Lazarus relatives, Lazarus sisters, they never knew what was going on. God knew what was going on. Hallelujah. He knew that purpose cannot be defected. And when Jesus preached that Lazarus grave in John chapter 11 vers 43, blessed be the name of the Lord. The Bible says, "And when he had and and when he that had spoken and he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus come forth. And he that was dead came forth and bh and bound hand and foot clothes.

And as they were growing, Jacob learned Esau's weakness. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. How did he know? Maybe every time when the food is brought in the dining is restless. When the mother is giving, praise be to God. Even in self service, he will even forget that the father his father has not served himself. And Jacob say, [Music] "Oh, and they are believers like that. They can even sell their birthight because of food. They can sell their birth because of money. Praise be to God." They say, "I will do it and come and repent. your brother. Praise be to God. Doesn't care. After all, the birthight is mine according to the law. So, I will just tell him. Let me eat. Praise be to God. Jacob was smart. One day the brother was so hungry. Praise be to God.

Are you sure my brother? You know what you're talking about. I I believe he also pretended as if he does not want it. But my portage also but anyway you can have it. But before I have it first swear, my young brother, I swear in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ from today and forth giving you my birthright. Hallelujah. Amen. Receive it. He say amen. And maybe when he said amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Something changed in his life. Brethren, the word speaks and the word creates spoken word is the original seed. Hallelujah. Esau's word was anointed because that was the right time to shift the birthight to Jacob. And I believe when he spoke and Jacob received something happened. like Mary when received the word of the angel and he said be unto me according to your word something happened in the womb of Mary. Hallelujah. And maybe Esa also felt like the anointing leaving him. Praise be to God. And you know God is so interesting. I believe few days after that time they started addressing Jacob in kind of a special way. Yes sir. When Jacob when David was anointed he never remained the same. Things started to change. It was gradually but the change was taking place. Hallelujah. Because anointing breaks the yoke. The moment David was anointed. Amen. The yoke started to break. Hallelujah. Amen. And maybe God say did I did I say that this guy will you see that's why sometimes when you advised by our pastor and they tell you that under no circumstance to the believer manelver say but pastor she is so beautiful wash out but when I look in church the other thing oh my good lord she's beautiful tube not even square forgetting the devil has spiced it the devil has spiced the portage He wanted to sell your bathroom.

You will go and start proposing to an unbeliever and she will tell you but I thought you are born again. And then said you know we human shame on you if you are there. I have had that where a brother went and going to see an unbeliever. See even born again, you are marked. And if you have a purpose and you know why you are here, you will run for your life. Come before at the altar. and repent. Say, "God, I'm sorry because your grace have found me." Yes, sir. Psalms and Philistians are on you. He comes then and tear those roads not knowing the devil is looking for. He's on his way. You know the devil those those devil's daughters they are also under anointing. She will just whisper a words and you will get a stroke. Maybe God is speaking. That is the devil's [Music] anointing. Run for your life because you have a purpose and there are many things fighting against that. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And don't forget this. God is watching you. What are you going to choose? must remember my brethren that we cannot be tempted beyond our face. Blessed be the name of the Lord. I don't care how spies that the devil has sp that Jezebel. Even if that Jezebel comes to you naked, you will escape still. Joseph was in Porta's house. He was serving there and the woman and first woman started lusting after Joseph. Joseph never said now the opportunity has shown up. The Bible only tells us where that incident happened. But if you read between the line, Joseph might have resisted trillion temptations. I remember one time I was working somewhere after spending the whole night in [Music] prayer. Praise be to God. In the morning when I came out of my room and I was going to the washroom, the washroom was out [Music] and there was a lady who was from showering when she saw me going toward the direction she was coming from. [Music] And she just dropped her towel. I told her, "You do it next time. I will fire you from here." Because I was their boss. What am I trying to do? But wife might have done everything until that was the last trial. Maybe cut walking before Joseph. Joseph are you not see putting on dresses and comes and when Joseph sees some may be coming Joseph goes another and was hurting brethren. I know. I know how it is. A woman to tell you that she loves you and you turn her down. One day I was in senior six and there was a girl, she was my classmate and uh we were kind of not that close friend but we were sitting on the same desk and when I was in my high school I used to move with my everyday used to carry a message book every time. At least I remember for all the years I was I was at school, every day I read a message. Praise be to God. And then I did know that the girl was lusting after me. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And then time came for preps. The dressing God started to change. And when she finally speaking to another [Music] girl and that was trouble, then I smelled her said one day. I think she gathered courage like for two months. [Music] And she came and told me, "Do you know that I love you? It was my first time in life. I I became confused because when I was growing, I used to fear ladies and girls so much. I was so shy. But at least I knew my stand. So when she told me that, I said impossible because community where we grew up from that that person is considered as a prostitute. How do you tell a man that you love? I told her sister. He said, "I'm not your sister." Praise be to God. All along that's how I've been seeing you sayhuh. She told me for me they don't reject me. Go and think about it. I told I don't need to think about this. I have told you I'm a Christian. I'm also Catholic. And the way that thing that girls, the way the thing hurted her, she was hurt to the extent that she changed the school. And after her senior six, when she came back, she looked for my number because her cousin was my friend and still she called. My brethren, I never looked at that as an opportunity and that was not enough. There were other two girls near our neighborhood. But one day, it was a Saturday, God sent a pastor from Cases. called Pastor Easter. Praise be to God. He preached on Sunday and these are the words he told me. He told my brother, "Be careful. The devil is after you." And I said, "How did he know?" But because there's a purpose in my life, God protected me. I never messed up. Amen. all my years of school up to today and I trust by the grace of God I will never mess up. Temptations are there, women are there, girls are there and ladies. Amen. But the grace of God will hold me because I have a purpose. Amen. Praise be to God. Wife became annoyed. Tell the [Music] guys Joseph had a purpose. And you have a purpose. The reason you are slothful sometimes is because you don't know your purpose. But brother, you have a purpose. It cannot be defeated. Never, never, never, it cannot be defeated. Even when you are going through the fire, it will never be defeated. Hallelujah. Praise be to God. It is the word keeping us. Let us cling to the world. Let us be glory. Let us be at afraid of the cross looking unto Jesus. Forgetting about our yesterday where we have failed yesterday, where you failed this morning. But I'm the voice right now. The voice of God telling you, you have a purpose in your life. Stay focused. be to God. Amen. Praise the Lord. There is so many entertaining things of our day. There is so much to entice people to to to what they would call [Music] pleasure. And it is for all people and all ages. But to you have a purpose, you cannot be shaken. Praise be to God. Jesus had a purpose. He knew why he was on earth. He knew his mission. He knew the mission was not for him. Even when the devil told him to turn water into to turn a stone into bread, Jesus never paid the devil because there was a purpose and it must be accomplished. Blessed be the name. I'm just I'm ending with this scripture. Let's read in uh in Romans chapter 8 vers 20. We shall begin from 28. We start from 27. And he that searchth the heart knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saint according to the will of God. And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God. To them who are the called according to his purpose. [Music] [Music] Amen. According to his purpose. God's purpose is your purpose. And the Bible say all things work together for whe they work for our good for whom he did for no he also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among his many [Music] brethren. And more and moreover whom he did predestinate them, he also called. And whom he called them, he also justified. justified them. He also glorified. What shall we say then to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? Who can be against you? Even death can't be against you. No trouble can be against you. No challenge can be against you. No problem can be against you. Amen. If God be for me, who can put me down? Which problem can put me down? Hallelujah. Amen. I will go through the storm. But the storm will not tear me down because I am an eagle. I am designed to face the storm. And it is said it is said in the eyes of the storm. That's where the eagle face when the storm is coming westward. The ego will not go eastward. The eagle will go northwestward. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Because the ego knows after gone through the storm. Hallelujah. There is company behind the storm. Don't run away from your storm. Yes, even I have my storms. But every single day, every single moment I am facing my storm and I'm going through one by one. I pass through to I go through Katrina and I go. Hallelujah. Amen. Whatever comes my way My brother, my sister, if God be for us, who can be against us. Amen. I know the plan I have toward. Not what you are seeing right now. That's not what God has toward.

He will lead you to unex he will give unexpected yes and when you look back you will speak like summer of oil and say see how far the Lord has brought us sir do not panic don't be shaken the Lord is on our side. Praise be to God. I know he's on my side. The me you're looking at today is not what I'm going to be the next. What I'm going to be the next day is what God has prepared me to be. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Because the Bible gives us a promise that we don't know what we shall be. But he gives us again assurance. One thing we know when he will appear let him appear even now and he will know what I'm going to be. I'm going to be spotless without wrinkle an overcomer. So he who overcome will sit with me on my father's throne. Do you know the kind of people are going to sit with Jesus on his father's throne? Look at me. Yes. Maybe brother not. You are just excited. I am not. Maybe I'm excited because I'm going to sit with him. You don't even look like overcomer. I am. Overcomers. They don't have three legs. They have two like mine. The Bible tells us Elijah, he was just an ordinary man like he just broke the world three and a half years no rain. You are joking. If God be for me, if he if he be for Elijah, he spoke to the king jokingly and told him king, it will not rain even two will not fall for three and a half years and he locked heaven. And he put the key in his pocket and went to the cave. The situation affected Elijah. Oh, the raven was prepared to take care of the man of God. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. And Elijah had revival. It was not raining. They looked for Elijah. He was nowhere to be seen. Hallelujah. The man had gone dark. Hallelujah. He had revival with the angels. That was not ordinary [Applause] leaven.

The rean fed the man of God and the man was now when he saw the brook dried up And God told him, "Uhuh, move on. I still have, brethren, Elijah had an expected end when the brook dried up." God took him to the wind. Praise the Lord. Let God be for you. your enemies. Praise be to God. What I heard one sister was giving a testimony where she work where she works.
