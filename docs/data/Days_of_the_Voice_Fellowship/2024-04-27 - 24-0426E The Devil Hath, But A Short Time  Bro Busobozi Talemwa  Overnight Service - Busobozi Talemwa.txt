hallelujah and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was there Place found anymore in heaven and Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the of his Christ and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accuses them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death that are for rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them who to the inhabitants of the earth and of of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he has but a short time so today I'm speaking to you on the devil has but a short time please be seated may the Lord bless the reading of his word hallelujah amen thank you for coming to church God bless you you have someone close to you tell them God bless you you're welcome to the amen whenever we come to church we are called into a communion we are called to come to a conference a conference with God and and the media department or the music department I don't know which department it is I want to appreciate you for the good sound today one time sometime back they told me we appreciate them when we we we rebuke them when things are not well and when sound is good we do not commment so how many appreciate them amen God bless you amen the devil has but a short time and so tonight also we are called into a conference with God we are going to have a good weekend whereby we are having a visiting Ministry and so as your pastor I thought at least I should give you one message in the week and so I thought I should speak tonight amen because on Wednesday we had brother ephra and then on Sunday we are going to have Pastor Gideon and so I thought I should speak tonight amen amen on Monday the Lord willing we going to have the bench again and uh yeah I can see there are people who love it amen and this time by God's grace the Lord will it will be with brother ephra and so so that we can hear more testimonies what God is doing with him in Ethiopia many other things that will be an inspiration to our generation So speaking of a Time the short time that the devil has the battle that we are fighting here on Earth see usually in a time like this I would want to I know according to our time I have about 30 minutes to speak to you but I know I will go a little more than that but for the things I want to speak I want to speak from my heart to yours how are ready to receive from amen and brother Andrew still you're not supposed to be all the way the other side you know where your yeah you know where your place is someone could be lonely amen the devil has but a short time and and and so I was saying that the battle of the world that we are fighting the Battle of sin the war of sin uh the war of indifference the war of the cares of the world the Tres of this life it all did not start with us we were only a victim of circumstances and so I want you to smile this evening a victim of circumstances but we are people who have hope no one can be so bad that the grace of God cannot redeem because God is Not contending with you God is contending with Satan and you are a child of God but the devil his desire is to take you out from the hand of God but he cannot do that because we are for ordained of God to overcome the world praise the name of the Lord amen and So speaking about a time of the devil we see the Bible Begins by saying that there was war in heaven and we know that that's where everything started Michael and his angels fought against the [Music] dragon and the dragon F and his angels you see this is when Satan thought that he was good and he thought he could be able to take the place of God and he wanted to go and Ascend at the at the Throne of God but of course he he was shortsighted he did not know he knew that God had made him and he was deceived in himself to think that the power that he has was greater than the power that God has Satan is making the same mistake today you to think that the power of of God is lesser than his power you know what tell me what can the devil bring your way what can the devil bring my way that will be more than the power of God the power of God is greater than all the power of God is greater than sickness we know that all sickness is caused by the devil so the power of God is greater than the power of sickness it is greater than the power of sin it is greater than the power of of failure greater than any other power God is over and Beyond everything that the devil has you know he can stand there and tell the devil bring your best and even his best come defeat the when I when I think about that I get encouraged in my soul when I think about what the devil has done in my life from the day I was born the traps tried to lay for me you know imagine the traps is try to lay for you and he thought that one will surely kill that one will surely kill him every time he L that took you beyond that took you beyond that and even the Bible says when these bodies are failed even have another one Wai so in other words in this body and out of this body we are more than conquerors through Christ that gives us strength and so the devil the Bible says is the devil Satan the deceiver of the whole world so he was cast out into the Earth and so when the battle raged in heaven the devil now thought I am going okay now because I've been defeated up here let me go down on the earth I will defeat everything he thought he will defeat us but you know when he was cast down God gave him an allotment of time did you know that when Angels sin they cannot be forgiven but when a child of God sin they will always be forgiven but the devil and all Angels they they can never be forgiven I am so glad I am a child of God because I can be forgiven and the Bible tells me he is the accuser of the brethren and he was cast out of Heaven he came down to the Earth and he is the he is now here on Earth what does he do he the Tormentor imagine brother Solomon that Satan is the Tormentor do you know to torment the Bible says that you know he's the he's not only the accuser but he also to Mens a person who inflicts severe mental or physical suffering on someone and we see there are many people who are tormented here on Earth you remember the man who was in the toms of GAD he was being tormented by the devil his mental state was not good when he was in those storms the devil had made him lose his mind imagine a man a human being living among dead bodies and he was you know you know almost naked and um you know just sleeping there eating there doing which s man with the same mind can do that the devil was tormenting that and we see there are many people who are tormented and you know I usually take that scripture to actually say that people there are many people who alive we see that they are alive but they are tormented because these are the kind of people you find that in their mind they're not doing well even the place where they sleep when you reach there you can almost vomit that's a clear sign that someone is being to mened but anyone who is Washed by the blood of Jesus you know this the holy spirit is a clean Spirit he will take away all uncleanness you know if if you are sleeping in a place that looks like a like a a pig's [Music] time when the Holy Spirit comes in your heart he will clean you up that you will even find it impossible for you to sleep in such a place you will find it impossible for you to live in a home you will find it impossible for you to come in church you will just find yourself coming even before the service to clean up because the holy spirit is a clean Spirit but people who are dir and unlean are people who are being tormented by and they don't even have an idea they being tormented you see these are people who you will find that they uh they take drugs for instance and you know it will control their mind where they will go what they will say what they in the mouth you find that they are V in their their words or their tongue doesn't have a filter you know he speaks a word bu and everybody get did you just actually say that you see this person saying those words is being tormented by demons and you know we are living in L the Bible says they don't even know they're being Ted so we are living in a generation that is full of human beings that are being tormented by Satan you know they're being afflicted by Satan praise the name of the Lord amen hallelujah amen what is an Affliction you know where you find that someone is in a state that they don't want to be in but they Bound by they Bound by it they seem not to have a power live above that you you'll find a person for example being afflicted by the demon of telling lies you see what is that they are under Affliction you find someone being afflicted by disease what is that the spirit of Affliction but do you know that you know the devil is the one that does all these he's the one who brings a bad situation many people by the way do you know that many people in our generation are being afflicted by the spirit of depression depression whereby someone has no joy did you know that lack of joy is the beginning of of depression in your life whereby you you don't have joy you don't have you don't have freedom in your spirit the devil takes your spirit and he binds you for someone to see a smile out of you they would rather beat you thousand Strokes because you do not have joy in your heart you are being afflicted by the spirit of sadness and you know someone says I'm unhappy I don't know I don't know about you but have you ever been around people who are unhappy they have bad [Music] energy yeah you know because they they are afflicted they don't have joy in their SP but do you know what happens when someone receives the Holy Spirit the first thing that comes to them spirit is joy and the Bible says the joy of the Lord is our strength that's why true genuine Believers are joyful people and these people who have who who have this spirits of depressions who are being afflicted by like that you know when you stay around them for so long you also begin to be afflicted you begin to be afflicted before you even know it this is a negative spirit and that's why a Believer should constantly be in prayer a Believer should constantly be in an atmosphere that brings Joy you know the world is inde that's why they go to find instant Joy why they find instant Joy is because they don't have joy in their heart so they will decide to go and drink alol because they feel they down they want to go in a in a a party where everybody is happy and they put this kind of music where they begin jumping and everybody begin they drink alcohol oh they are so happy for a moment the devil deceives them that they happy they they start to take drugs have you ever seen you know those kind of people that get depressed and they literally begin to shake and they feel their craving to to to smoke because they depressed and Afflicted and when they begin to smoke then they will relax relax now I've qued my nerves I'm now happy but what is that they're being Afflicted what is that it's Demons of Affliction it is spirits of Satan are depressing them but a child of God when these demons come to attack you amen what do you do you go to God In Prayer what do you do you put on Christian music you begin listening what do you do you take this Christian H you begin singing you begin singing when you're down by the time you finish the song your spirit has already been lifted how many feel happy when they sing amen how many feel happy when they sing again hallelujah what happens to us when we begin singing our spirit amen gets connected to the spirit of God brings that Joy the B says is there anyone happy let him see hallelujah amen you see when we are down you put on the word you begin listening to the word and then the word begins to lift you up amen even prayer in itself as you begin to pray you know you are maybe sleeping on the bed and you did you know those Spirits the devil knows there's no Spirit of Affliction he'll bring them at the moment when you need to overcome them when when when the hospitals you pray then the devil will afflict you with with tiredness andar s like let me sleep for one more hour and then you sleep for one more hour let me sleep for 30 more minutes but let me tell you when you are sleeping the spirit of God wakes you up to pray if you are weak don't worry pray where you are there is nothing like that prayer God only hears prayer when you're kneeling down God hears prayer when you are sleeping when youing when you are standing when you are walking when you are working hallelujah amen God hears prayer every time he says pray and ceasing you can't be on your knees forever like I mean like like in that posture you cannot be like the because it says pray and ceasing so you have to be on your knees for 24 hours 365 days a year no it doesn't mean that it simply means pray all the time whatever you are pray whatever you are doing pray so if you are tired and wor begin to pray there begin to PR there don't worry you oh thank you Lord Jesus pray this morning that you lift me up and give me strength and before you know it you are sitting down on your bed continue to pray to pray before you know it signing up before you know it you're walking around before you know it you're Clapping Your Hands you're boxing the wall you're jumping up why because the power Amen in you has been lifted that joy of the Lord comes by prayer that's why we are here we are not here to pray because we are prayer warriors we are here to pray because we are weak and only the spirit of God can make warriors out of us and and especially for those of you who don't know how to pray or feel that you cannot pray just begin to pray and leave the rest for him tell him your heart some people when they say let us pray they just kneel down and put their head down have they finished praying they're still praying and you will always remain sad pray your heart talk to praying to God comes out of our heart that is willing and desire to hear from but the devil always comes to afflict us he wants to torment us and then at the end of the day go and accuse us back to the father Satan and his demons have taken over the world and the systems of the world by the way it is becoming increasingly difficult for us to live down here the world systems are all rotten to the the religion is rotten politics is rotten economics is rotten everything you know to get money you have to bribe to you know religion itself there are people is rotten teachings are teachings are not even the scripture people who claim to believe Christ are the ones who are even worse than the ones who don't believe him politics I don't even need to talk about it let me tell you the devil is the ruler did you know that today Satan is the ruler of this Eden that is why it seems us to be it's difficult for believers to live on Earth it's going to become more and more difficult sin will be lifted up and it will be accepted by everyone that it will be um it will be a shame for those who do not believe in sin and they will be outcast but let me tell you brother the devil who is castigating all these things he was cast down here on Earth and he's not going to be here permanently the devil is going to be here only for a special time don't let him amen BL your vision don't let all these demons all these little Spirits blind some people when they temped once Just Surrender they said me I'm no longer going to overcome but let me tell you brother and sister you have to be like men whereby you stand and say I am not going to bow down I accept defeat even when you are sick and you almost dying you will say I am not accept this sickness I am healed in Jesus name not because you already feeling the because you know sickness is not permanent but I you I we are permanent we are Eternal beings the Bible says when this body amen is dissolved when we die when we come out of this body there is another one to receive us hallelujah and that is an eternal body if you anybody every one of us has one we are just waiting to walk into just waiting to walk into you let me tell you brother amen this Bible is real and God is real just like we see sickness is real but sickness is not really real but the word of God and the promises of God are real praise God Amen after the Rapture the devil will be bound for a thousand years he knows that is coming Saturn now I'm talking about for just a moment the time of Saturn he knows that that time is coming when he going to be bound for a thousand years and during the a thousand years that will be the Millennium of the bride and a Heavenly bridegroom and do you know the Bible says after the Millennium Satan will be losed for a space But even that time when the devil is lose you know he will immediately start from where he stopped he will immediately go and gather all the inhabitants of the earth and and and tempt them to go and attack the holy city who will be living in the ho City who will be living in the ho City the bride and the groom we shall be in the holy city and when he is when he tempts them to go and attack the city you know the Bible says that fire came down from and it consumed him he consumed all those let let us read it in the Book of Revelation it's just very a very interesting Revelation praise the name of the Lord amen that is revelation 20 and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand now this is now after the Rapture um um you see the devil because you see as as God is preparing the Earth for the Millennium how can he rule on Earth when the devil is also continuing to rule the time of the rule of the devil must come to an end and while Christ is ruling on Earth the devil will be bound we ought to say hallelujah to that amen and he says I saw a mighty Angel come down from heaven and he had a key to the bottomless and he also oh Hallelujah he also had a great chain in his and he laid his hand on the dragon that old serp and that called devil and Satan he bound him a thousand years let the believer say hallelujah hallelujah he bound him for a thousand years oh somebody tell sat Satan be careful be careful well if you don't say that maybe you're on his side tell him Sat be careful amen there is coming a day when he going to be bound for at that time there will be no sickness there will be no pain there will be no temptation fear may be no you know pain in our lives because the devil will be bound his time will be over oh hallelujah hallelujah amen I'm preaching I'm feeling like right now I'm preaching to theop hallelujah amen brother you will be there sister you will be there and when you are there you will be p no sickness no pain no suffering and the devil our accuser people be an angel came down with a great chain in his hand and with a key to the bottomless so when he threw the devil down after binding him the devil continued going down for the whole 1000 Years the devil did not reach the Bott Hallelujah am the devil may have taken you on a trip where you feel like you are in a Cy of a cyc of sickness ay of trouble ay of tempations let me tell you brother sister oh Hallelujah the devil also soon going to enter his own Hallelujah C falling where he will not reach the bottom but you for the cycle you are in you have a redeemer we have a redeemer we have a redeemer the time of Satan is coming to anend Glory Hallelujah coming to an end oh my I feel religious tonight can you imagine Brother Martin yes sir when we are there amen we will be perfect our bodies will not be this war warmy body this body our bodies will be another kind we shall have glorified bodies praise God Amen we shall be in the resurrection that means we shall have glorified bodies bodies that are perfect bodies that can appear and disappear a body like what Jesus had when he rose from the dead he had a new body Oh Glory to God Amen and we are going to have those bodies and going to meet one another and we shall be happy amen that's right sometimes when you preach this things it sounds too good to be true but I am thinking right now after all is over it will be worth it it be worth it amen it will be worth all the overnights we have been in church it will be worth all the services we have being all the summons we have had I want you to be encourage the prayers we are pray there is nothing we are doing in vain oh we are preparing ourselves for our homecoming time why the devil is preparing his own God is preparing his own don't worry about the ups and downs you have gone through is a battle and the battle is aen between God and Satan and our enemy Satan is a defeated enemy can say amen amen he's a defeated enemy doesn't have any power he doesn't have any Oh Glory to God control over us but now he's exercising a little authority because we are living in a fallen backslid domain that he controls and this house of Flesh which we are living in but I tell you brother sister we are dropped we are trapped in this body but every day we hear the word of God we hearing from our other body we are connecting with our other body our theop my God Amen we that's why we say Amen what what is that it's a connection our spiritual body and our soul but right now our soul is trapped here but one day These Bars of born are going to bust hallelujah amen and we are going to come out oh my we're going to come out and we shall go in our real body but while we are still in this one let us not give up let us Contin fighting let us continue fighting oh how many are going to continue fighting we will fight amen until we overcome increase our courage Lord amen praise God amen amen and he says and he cast him into the bottomless pit and he shut him up and set a seal upon him and he should that he should deceive the Nations no more till the Thousand Years should be fulfill and after that he must be lose so that's the season I was talking about when the devil will be losed and that will be really ending at the close of the millennium yes when it is done then the devil will be loed and I saw Thrones and they that sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God and which all right let us um go verse five but the rest of the Dead live not again until the thousand years we have finished this is the first resurrection now we talking about uh the the the those who came up in the in the in the first resurrection he's speaking of the those who who would go in the Rapture you know those came up in the the ones who went in the rapture we in the first resurrection and they that were in the in the first resurrection or will be in the first resurrection the second death listen please listen the second death will have no power over them now the second death is the destruction of souls but the first death is the death of our bodies so now the Bible says six blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection yes yes blessed and holy on such the second death has no power but they shall be PR and of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years hallelujah amen and when the thousand years are expired Satan shall be led out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the Nations which were in the four quarters of the earth and the devil that deceived verse 10 now okay okay okay let us read verse n okay because of time and they went up on the breadth of the earth and compassed the camp of the Saints about now these are the people who were possessed now by the by Satan deceived by Satan and the Beloved City and and fire came down from God out of heaven and dived them and now listen amen I'm telling you know amen when the devil came down to amen deceive the other people to go and attack the city our headquarters on Earth amen he could not Prevail and the fire consumed all of them and the devil that deceived them oh be ready for this one now be ready for this one the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the Beast was was and where the false prophet was and they will be tormented they are forever amen somebody tell Satan your time is coming hallelujah amen come on tell your time is coming the day of sat is coming where he shall be cast to the Lake of Fire Oh Glory to God Amen and the Bible says Satan knows because he's being cast down on Earth but he has great rra because he knows he but a short time so he's he's very angry listen to me Church Satan is very angry because of one reason he knows he has but a short time so he's doing everything he can to finish all he can and that's why let me tell you brother us not rest because Satan is not resting let us not sleep because is not sleeping the more he comes to you the more you should go in prayer the more it comes in you the more you should amen go before God and hear his word let me tell you this is our time to ourselves in the word to ourselves in prayer because Satan knows he has a short time so he has to use every moment he has to use every every tactic let me tell you I am amen I'm putting sat on notice today I am some of you can join me tonight I am putting sat on not no matter what tactic he uses I am standing on a solid rock he cannot get he cannot get you as long as you are his beloved his eyes is on the sparrow and he's watching over us amen Satan knows he has but a short time he's doing everything he can to to steal to kill to Rob everything he come from us if he will rob our Zeal he will rob it whatever he can do he will do if if you rob our prayer life she will rob it if you will rob our fight he will rob it you will see many people going to church but very few Christians and the devil is happy but where is that Zeal and fire and sincerity now that doesn't mean that you're going to be perfect you know we have a wrong mentality and a wrong attitude when we come before God God knows that you are weak and that you insufficient he knows all that and that's why the other time I was preaching about sincerity so when you come before God don't go before him as some as a Christian oh God you know I'm saved sanctified I'm going to heaven what kind of pray is that come before him with sincerity with a broken heart he knows all your dirty he knows all your weakness but one thing I want to tell you tonight he's willing to strengthen you ify you to empower you to give you Grace but when you come before him in prayer approach him with that attitude amen come by the door of the blood accept your unworth accept your weakness you know I have noticed whenever I come before God without that attitude for a few moments I'm just you know like broken in his presence maybe for like 30 minutes and the whole time I'm praying broken crying but watch the next one hour and a half or two I'm praying like as if I'm on steroids as if I'm swimming what is that you've approached God a right way and his Spirit comes with you and then all of the sudden he makes you able he makes you able now go before Saturn with strength Authority why because then it's no longer your power no longer your author there not the power of the Holy Spirit do you know when you go to prayer through prayer should not be us praying it's not should not be us praying it should not be you praying it should be him praying him praying in us with his faith that is what serves us the faith of the Son of God and when he begins to pray in you sometimes you even find yourself making prophetic utterances over your life you begin praying declarations over your life and under that anointing you feel like there is no stop to it you feel you enjoying it how many experienced if you have never experienced it then I want to challenge you to do approach him like that and you will not regret afterwards even if you were dozing and having sleep and TI you realize that will all go will all be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a lowering lion WTH about seeking he resist steast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who has called us un his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while he will make you perfect he will establish you he will strengthen you hallelujah amen to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen amen Oh Glory to God Amen David cried in Psalms 2 said save me from The Lion his mouth for you have heard me from the horns of the unicorns I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the congregation will I Praise You job 21 there was a day when the sons of of God came to present themselves before the Lord and sat came also among them to present himself before the Lord and the Lord said unto Satan from come and Satan answered the he said from going to and in the world in the earth and from walking up and down that's what the devil does the devil always does that is going everywhere this week he has checked my home he has checked your homeing [Music] and is online he checked your home too brother did he check your home he checked your home your home angels but he's checking everywhere [Music] going where can I do can by that side brother the brother said he did he came around sister Angela did he come around there That's what Satan told and so as you were walking around did you see my said that one I know him I've [Music] alwaysed but the problem the reason why he's not cursing you and leaving you you have blessed him have given him everything he want how can he now C you now God said that's what you think because I blessed him okay go touch everything I've given him but don't dare touch his soul the devil never touched the soul of of job so even the devil obeys God the devil always obeys God by the way did you know that and do you know where God is God is in his word believer who believes the word God is in them if you have received the Holy Ghost God is in you that's why the Bible says you have power to bind you power to lose you can tell Satan to go here and he will you tell him to go here and you can touch the sick and the sick will cast out the spirit that Authority and the devil will always obey because he knows his time is only there before God comes down when God comes down his time has come to one end Oh Glory to God amen glory to God Amen and that is why we find because of time I not read the quote I have a long quote here in the message questions and answers but the M was talking about um excuse me he was talking about Satan how he went you know with Jesus up there and tried to tempt him he walked arounded to tempt him but listen oh I wish I had time I would read all this he was telling him all the kingdoms are given to me bow down worship me I give them over to you but Jesus did not because he knew all the kingdoms belong to him that's why we don't want need to worship Satan because all the kingdoms Belong To Us Praise the name of the Lord amen and we are given power to bind we are given power to lose and when Jesus was coming in Mathew 8:28 as was approaching that man who was possessed by demons listen the demon saw him coming they you have come to destroy us before our time they they know their time we have already talked about his he knows it he knows his time is coming but he knows also the same God who gave him that time can destroy him before his death but one thing about God he cannot break his own word so he can't destroy sat before he he can cast him out of a Believer and when those demons were cast out they went in the animals and drowned what Dr was not the spirits it was the animals where are those Spirits they are still on Earth today but we as Believers we are given the authority to cast them out and let me tell you if you're tormented by any Spirit prayer is the key key come together and pray Sometimes some Spirits need fasting you come together you fast and pray but God answers prayer praise the name of the Lord amen the devil's time is coming to an end do you know what would happen when the Seven Seals are open the Bible says there should be time no longer for who when we say we living in the end time the end of you end time I am Eternal I have no expired the end time of Satan and all the demons have been tormenting the children of God that's why I believe we Believers of the message are the answer the world that is dying and may God help us and give us the grace to maintain the standard and remain standing no matter what comes or goes we shall remain in our place knowing the devil has but he's trying his best but we are also in our post of Duty how do solders fight when one looks the other side one looks this side and another looks the other side and they fighting defending one another that's what we have to do amen musicians can come to protect one another and we do that through prayer amen praise God hallelujah shall we stand on our feet how many are ready to go before God In Prayer the Bible says the weapons of our Warfare are not caral but Mighty through God to pulling down of the strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exal and bringing into captivity every thought Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all [Music] Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled and in Ephesians 6 from verse 11 tells us to put on the and verse 18 says praying always all prayer and supplication and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints and he says and for me and also for me that utterance may be given unto me that utterance may be given unto me that I may be open my mouth boldly to make known The Mystery of the Gospel so whenever you pray don't always forget to pray for your pastor you see Ministry is not done by one man it is done by all of us together and so when you pray for me God helps me to bless you when you pray for the ministers Lord helps them by your prayer be a blessing to you the ministry needs prayers we need prayer to pray for one another because God answers prayer and that's why we are here tonight so for sometime we just sing one or two songs then we go to prayer for some [Music] time but after worship we shall you know maybe go offline and then just the saint can go in prayer and then if you been
