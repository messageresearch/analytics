[30:35] teaching on communion and foot
[30:42] washing we've not
[30:45] done we've not done that
[30:49] yet and our fellowship is 2 years
[30:54] old so we've been lacking in that area
[31:00] so and many of the young people
[31:03] especially those ones who just came into
[31:04] the message
[31:08] recently don't really know what foot
[31:12] washing
[31:15] is communion they might know because
[31:17] even in the
[31:18] religious churches they do
[31:23] [Music]
[31:24] communion but as much as they don't do
[31:27] it
[31:28] certainly according to the how we were
[31:30] told to do it in the
[31:34] Bible would like to teach on
[31:38] communion
[31:40] Friday I'm going to be teaching on that
[31:42] so I I'm requesting you to
[31:46] come to come on time it will be an
[31:49] evening
[31:52] service just like the one
[31:56] today will be beginning at 5:00
[32:01] p.m. to 7
[32:04] p.m. uh so then this Sunday Sunday no
[32:09] I've been asked by uh uh
[32:13] the
[32:20] Tom to go and Minister for them he told
[32:22] me quite some time ago but I was praying
[32:25] about it and waiting upon see how God
[32:28] will lead
[32:33] me and so I just called him this um this
[32:37] afternoon and confirmed to him that
[32:38] would be
[32:43] coming so on Sunday this coming Sunday
[32:46] brother martin will be taking the
[32:48] service
[32:51] here and we believe that God will visit
[32:54] both here and in an as well
[32:59] so I'm asking that you remember both
[33:01] services in
[33:05] prayer amen uh then also next Wednesday
[33:10] today Wednesday so next
[33:14] Wednesday we will not have a normal
[33:16] Service as
[33:19] usual we shall be having I was going to
[33:23] call it a minister service but I think
[33:25] let it be a man's service
[33:34] service yeah so if you know you a
[33:41] man come and attend that meeting I want
[33:43] to talk things Ministry
[33:51] and so it will be a normal service for
[33:54] for the men for the
[33:55] brothers
[33:58] things that I have on my heart to share
[34:00] with
[34:02] you that is next next next
[34:08] Wednesday for our channel so those of
[34:12] you who will not be coming here we will
[34:14] put something for you on online so you
[34:16] can be able to have a
[34:24] service then
[34:28] um on on on the
[34:32] next Friday next week that is Friday
[34:34] next week
[34:38] yeah
[34:40] um I'm traveling to
[34:44] Kenya you know I've told you that we
[34:46] were invited by Pastor BTA to go and
[34:50] speak at his meetings in Western
[34:55] Kya
[34:58] [Music]

[35:36] time so they will be having meetings
[35:39] there on Friday Saturday Sunday Monday
[35:42] up to

[36:14] about 3
[36:20] hourss how long does it take to
[36:24] reacha 5 hours
[36:27] over five hours so it's like a

[50:06] amen so this
[50:10] evening uh I've also been requested to
[50:12] speak to evening light bright uh
[50:19] fellowship and so they are going to be
[50:21] streaming this service on their
[50:24] Zoom
[50:27] and so I send our greetings to the
[50:30] Saints at evening light
[50:34] Bri may the Lord bless each of you and
[50:37] Grant the desires of your
[50:40] heart shall we please turn to First
[50:48] John vers
[50:53] 4 chapter 4 ver 17
[51:01] rather
[51:06] amen we read from 17 to 19 as you know
[51:09] whenever we are speaking to the Saints
[51:11] on Zoom we always have but one
[51:17] hour and so uh you always try to catch
[51:21] me quickly so I don't have to take a
[51:22] long time uh laying a a big
[51:29] Foundation you can do that if you focus
[51:34] right and then the Lord will bless
[51:37] you so we're reading from verse
[51:40] 17 here in is our love made perfect that
[51:43] we may have boldness in the day of
[51:46] judgment because as he is so are we in
[51:51] this world there is no fear in love but
[51:55] perfect love casts out
[51:58] fear because fear has
[52:01] torment he that fear is not made perfect
[52:05] in love we love him because he first
[52:08] loved
[52:14] [Music]
[52:24] us
[52:31] [Music]
[52:50] amen amen amen you may be
[52:54] seated
[52:55] uh for a while now my mind has been
[52:58] going around the subject of
[53:04] love and so today I did not know what
[53:07] exactly I was going to speak
[53:11] on but then I had that
[53:15] fear and so I'm going to speak on
[53:18] fear this evening fear tell your
[53:21] neighbor
[53:24] fear even by speaking that word fear you
[53:26] already are
[53:30] fearing so you don't know what a might
[53:34] fear and so there are two categories of
[53:36] fear in the
[53:38] Bible the first category of fear is the
[53:41] fear of the
[53:43] Lord and the second category of fear is
[53:46] the spirit of
[53:49] fear now the fear of the
[53:52] Lord is not necessarily like fearing
[53:55] something
[53:59] bad but it means to respect
[54:03] God it means to have a reverence for his
[54:07] power and His
[54:10] [Music]
[54:12] glory and you also respect you have you
[54:16] respect or you have respect for his
[54:18] anger and for his
[54:19] [Music]
[54:22] wrath um it could also mean to know God
[54:26] is
[54:30] God to know him as
[54:33] God and to know him as
[54:36] Supreme you know that is having the fear
[54:39] of the
[54:42] Lord to consider him in all things as
[54:45] first
[54:48] priority the reason why the people in
[54:50] the world have no fear of the
[54:54] Lord it's because they do not take God
[54:56] or they don't they don't know God as
[55:00] God and so they have no fear of the
[55:04] Lord and that's why they
[55:06] sin but you cannot
[55:09] sin he that is Born Again cannot
[55:13] see not because he's fearing the
[55:17] people but because he's fearing
[55:21] God what brings that distinction between
[55:24] between a and a
[55:27] nonbeliever is that a nonbeliever or a
[55:29] make believer or or a fake
[55:34] believer not will will will not do
[55:37] certain things in in in certain
[55:45] places because they fear
[55:48] man or they fear to be
[55:50] seen or they fear to be known that they
[55:53] will not that they can do such a
[55:58] thing and so they will not fear to tell
[56:01] a
[56:03] lie they will not fear to tell a
[56:06] lie because to them there's nothing
[56:09] about
[56:11] it they will tell you they will ask them
[56:14] what is it that you are
[56:16] doing it's nothing because to them it's
[56:19] nothing
[56:21] much but a child of
[56:23] God you have the fear of the Lord in
[56:28] you you will fear and you will
[56:31] tremble because you consider God first
[56:34] in all things that you
[56:37] do you don't know him as just you know
[56:40] some God somewhere but you know him as
[56:43] God as Supreme in your
[56:49] life some people they even say he's a
[56:52] god of white
[56:53] people
[56:56] no I was going about to take a subject
[56:59] probably in the future I'll take a
[57:00] subject on that white people most of the
[57:03] white the majority of the white people
[57:04] have left
[57:10] God many of them no longer have the fear
[57:13] of the
[57:16] Lord and and we see that the fear of the
[57:19] Lord is the beginning of
[57:23] wisdom that's what the Bible says Every
[57:26] Nation on Earth that has
[57:29] prospered you go back in history and
[57:33] study you will find that that Nation had
[57:36] the fear of the
[57:39] Lord every family that has
[57:42] prospered you will find that the the
[57:44] father of that family raised or the
[57:46] mother raised the children on the basis
[57:48] of the fear of the
[57:53] Lord you even find out that the father
[57:56] of Barack Obama was a
[58:00] Muslim and if Barack Obama was raised by
[58:03] his father in
[58:06] Kenya he would never have got to that
[58:08] place of power and
[58:12] influence but he reached that he
[58:15] attained that because his mother raised
[58:17] him up on the B of the fear of the
[58:23] Lord
[58:25] and so he he he was able to get to a
[58:28] place of power and
[58:33] influence
[58:35] because he re he had the reverence for
[58:39] God the scripture continues on a good
[58:42] understanding have all they that do his
[58:51] Commandments his praise endure forever
[58:56] so we notice that the fear of the Lord
[58:58] has good
[59:01] benefits it is the beginning of wisdom
[59:04] it's the beginning of
[59:06] knowledge is the beginning or it brings
[59:09] good
[59:12] understanding it leads to good life and
[59:14] to real
[59:17] life you know the fear of the Lord
[59:19] brings rest and peace to your
[59:23] soul
[59:25] it brings
[59:27] contentment listen it brings
[59:31] satisfaction Proverbs 17 it says the
[59:34] fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[59:38] knowledge just like in Psalms triple1
[59:43] 10 it's the beginning of
[59:45] knowledge but then he says but
[59:48] fools despise wisdom and
[59:53] instruction so the fear of the Lord is
[59:55] the beginning of
[59:58] wisdom but but the fools despise
[1:00:02] wisdom meaning if you you despise
[1:00:06] wisdom you will not fear the lord and
[1:00:09] you are a
[1:00:10] fool that's the conclusion of the whole
[1:00:13] matter but I don't want to be a fool I
[1:00:16] want to be wise I want to be with good
[1:00:20] understanding he says but fools despise
[1:00:23] wisdom and instruction
[1:00:27] Proverbs 14:16 says a wise man
[1:00:33] fearth and depart from
[1:00:37] evil but the
[1:00:39] fool he
[1:00:41] raes and is
[1:00:44] confident even when the word of God is
[1:00:47] preached you will find that some people
[1:00:49] are
[1:00:51] fools that they are confident in their
[1:00:54] sin
[1:00:56] they confident in their LIF
[1:00:59] style and they are not willing to live
[1:01:01] that
[1:01:04] lifestyle because they
[1:01:06] fools but he says a wise man
[1:01:10] fearless and departed from
[1:01:13] Evil so what is that kind of fear that
[1:01:17] is the fear of the
[1:01:19] Lord and in Proverbs
[1:01:22] 14:15 it says simple believeth every the
[1:01:26] simple believeth every
[1:01:29] word but The Prudent man look well to
[1:01:33] his
[1:01:37] going a wise man
[1:01:40] fear and depart from
[1:01:43] evil but the fool
[1:01:46] raes and is
[1:01:50] confident he keeps on repeating these
[1:01:53] words now why wouldn't why wouldn't uh a
[1:01:58] man want to have
[1:02:02] wisdom why wouldn't he want to follow
[1:02:07] instruction because they are
[1:02:10] fool and the scripture then says a fool
[1:02:14] has said in his
[1:02:16] heart there is no
[1:02:20] God but I trust you that are listening
[1:02:23] to me this evening
[1:02:26] you believe there is a God in
[1:02:28] heaven and you don't believe only that
[1:02:30] there is a God in
[1:02:33] heaven but you believe that he is the
[1:02:36] only
[1:02:39] God
[1:02:41] absolute and is the master of of your
[1:02:44] life and is the
[1:02:46] ultimate and
[1:02:49] absolute and that he the fearing him is
[1:02:52] the beginning of all wisdom
[1:02:55] and fearing him brings good
[1:02:59] understanding listen here in Proverbs
[1:03:04] 14:26 he says in the fear of the
[1:03:07] Lord is strong
[1:03:10] confidence and his children shall have a
[1:03:13] place of
[1:03:15] [Music]
[1:03:16] Refuge the fear of the Lord is a
[1:03:18] Fountain of
[1:03:21] Life to depart from the snake SNES of
[1:03:26] death meaning if you fear the lord you
[1:03:30] will not come into the snares of
[1:03:34] the the devil lays
[1:03:37] snares in the ways of every
[1:03:40] believer in whichever area of
[1:03:44] Life the devil will try to ensnare
[1:03:48] you the devil will try to snare me he
[1:03:51] will try to snare you but then what did
[1:03:55] he say here he says the fear of the
[1:03:58] Lord is a Fountain of
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:02] Life and he says to depart from
[1:04:05] it his snars of death and that's why
[1:04:09] brother sister we should never depart
[1:04:11] from the fear of the
[1:04:14] Lord it is the fear of the Lord that
[1:04:17] will bring us to
[1:04:19] repentance it is the fear of the Lord
[1:04:22] that will will keep us within the
[1:04:24] context of the
[1:04:27] word if it wasn't for
[1:04:29] that that is in our hearts many of us
[1:04:33] would have been in the
[1:04:36] world many of us many of you listening
[1:04:39] to me tonight we would have been in the
[1:04:42] world we have the power to do the things
[1:04:44] the world
[1:04:46] does but because of the fear of the Lord
[1:04:49] is not something you make up it is
[1:04:52] something that amen God Ls up in your
[1:04:56] soul amen he just kind of gives you that
[1:05:01] fear I've heard and I've seen and spoken
[1:05:04] to many
[1:05:06] Believers told me I was on the brink of
[1:05:09] going into
[1:05:11] sin but somehow at that
[1:05:13] moment fear came over me and I couldn't
[1:05:17] go through with it what was that it was
[1:05:20] the fear of the
[1:05:22] Lord what does it do he say it is a
[1:05:24] Fountain of
[1:05:27] Life Proverbs
[1:05:29] 19:23 the fear of the Lord tendeth to
[1:05:34] life and he that has it shall abide
[1:05:44] satisfied tell your neighbor you will be
[1:05:47] satisfied if you have the fear of the
[1:05:49] Lord he shall not be visisted with evil
[1:05:54] if you fear the lord evil shall not come
[1:05:57] in your house evil shall not come in
[1:06:00] your
[1:06:01] day shall not come where may try to come
[1:06:06] but it cannot abide in
[1:06:09] there place in a
[1:06:11] house in an individual that has the fear
[1:06:14] of the
[1:06:15] Lord praise the name of the Lord this
[1:06:18] the fear of the Lord that called David
[1:06:20] to
[1:06:22] repentance was a man he was
[1:06:24] King he feared
[1:06:27] nobody like all Kings who become
[1:06:31] fools for thinking that because they are
[1:06:33] Kings they there's nobody above
[1:06:37] them we have a record of them in the
[1:06:40] scriptures also in history kings that
[1:06:44] have not feared
[1:06:46] God and God brought them
[1:06:49] down but we find that all kings that
[1:06:52] feared God
[1:06:54] God loved them God gave them long life
[1:06:58] God blessed them because of the fear of
[1:07:01] the Lord it brought them down to
[1:07:02] repentance each time they
[1:07:06] sin I remember when David
[1:07:09] sinned David committed
[1:07:11] immorality and murder and when this
[1:07:14] happened in his
[1:07:16] life you know and the prophet of God
[1:07:18] came and gave a
[1:07:21] prophecy and he told him what he had
[1:07:23] done
[1:07:25] the fear of the Lord came upon him and
[1:07:27] he faed a war and began crying to the
[1:07:29] Lord and we know he said God against you
[1:07:32] and you only have I
[1:07:35] seen what a
[1:07:37] king this was a man that knew that
[1:07:40] nobody in Israel was above
[1:07:43] him but there is something he heard and
[1:07:46] it was called the fear of the
[1:07:49] Lord the fear of the Lord took him away
[1:07:53] from
[1:07:56] God loved David and God blessed David
[1:07:59] and God told David I'll give you an
[1:08:02] everlasting
[1:08:03] house I give you an everlasting
[1:08:06] Kingdom and David was was blessed all
[1:08:10] through and yet when his son
[1:08:14] came Solomon he did not fear the
[1:08:18] lord after building the Temple after
[1:08:21] doing everything he did later on he
[1:08:25] builds houses of other
[1:08:28] gods and because he didn't fear God by
[1:08:30] doing
[1:08:32] that God removed
[1:08:34] him and he put his
[1:08:37] servant to be a king brethren we should
[1:08:40] fear
[1:08:41] God our God is a living God the B says a
[1:08:45] consuming
[1:08:46] fire Praise In The Name
[1:08:49] Of and but then tonight I don't want to
[1:08:51] speak and dwell so much on the fear of
[1:08:53] the
[1:08:56] Lord I want to speak on the spirit of
[1:09:00] fear somehow I want to dwell on that for
[1:09:02] the remaining
[1:09:05] minute and this is the spirit of fear
[1:09:07] that the Bible is speaking of in the
[1:09:09] book of First
[1:09:12] John he says here in is our love made
[1:09:17] perfect that we may have boldness in the
[1:09:21] day of
[1:09:22] judgment
[1:09:25] brother you have to rectify my sound I
[1:09:27] cannot hear myself well that we may have
[1:09:29] boldness in the day of
[1:09:32] judgment because as he is so are we in
[1:09:37] this
[1:09:40] world and then he says there is no fear
[1:09:44] in
[1:09:46] love but perfect
[1:09:49] love cast out
[1:09:51] fear tell your neighbor perfect
[1:09:54] love out
[1:09:56] fear in the message
[1:09:59] expectation the prophet says this now
[1:10:03] fear has no valuation in
[1:10:06] [Music]
[1:10:08] it n
[1:10:11] whatsoever is perfectly
[1:10:15] endless it doesn't it it hasn't got one
[1:10:19] thing good about
[1:10:22] it if it because it says if I was to be
[1:10:26] a to be short in the
[1:10:29] [Music]
[1:10:30] morning I was if I was going to be short
[1:10:32] in the
[1:10:34] morning what good would it
[1:10:38] be to have
[1:10:41] fear what good would it do to
[1:10:44] me you say well what good would would
[1:10:47] Faith do to
[1:10:51] you Faith could deliver me
[1:10:55] but fear won't help me a
[1:10:58] bit you just get yourself all worked
[1:11:04] up and more
[1:11:07] nervous than ever when it comes time for
[1:11:09] the gun to
[1:11:13] fire by the time they bring a gun on
[1:11:16] your
[1:11:18] head you've already wasted
[1:11:22] yourself you already look so
[1:11:25] bad you you've already swe out swe it
[1:11:29] out you are so
[1:11:31] nervous your heart is
[1:11:34] bumping you've exed on
[1:11:37] yourself because of
[1:11:40] fear but he says if I was going to be
[1:11:42] executed in the
[1:11:45] morning what good does it have for me to
[1:11:50] fear fear has no valuation
[1:11:56] in
[1:11:59] whatever it is perfectly
[1:12:03] endless it doesn't it doesn't it hasn't
[1:12:07] got one thing about
[1:12:10] it so you say well what about
[1:12:13] faith what does faith do to you and says
[1:12:17] faith could deliver
[1:12:20] me faith will deliver
[1:12:22] you but fear won't help me a
[1:12:27] bit you just get yourself all wed up and
[1:12:30] more
[1:12:32] nervous and then when the time comes to
[1:12:35] fire you are so
[1:12:38] nervous she says let's have
[1:12:43] Fai Faith could deliver
[1:12:46] me doesn't but if it
[1:12:50] doesn't what good would fear do anyhow
[1:12:58] I Thought I Loved this qu so
[1:13:02] much Faith could deliver
[1:13:04] me but if it
[1:13:06] doesn't what good would fear do
[1:13:11] any so he said just stay right with
[1:13:16] faith hold to
[1:13:19] him take God's
[1:13:22] promise
[1:13:23] with
[1:13:25] God we've had a lot of people in the
[1:13:28] Bible here our examples who have had no
[1:13:32] fear absolutely
[1:13:34] whatever we can talk about a man
[1:13:39] like like
[1:13:41] Daniel when they told when a law was
[1:13:46] passed Daniel knew it was targeting
[1:13:50] him because he was worshiping God
[1:13:54] and and the law was passed that no one
[1:13:55] should worship any other
[1:13:59] God and so when Daniel heard
[1:14:02] it he even went and opened the
[1:14:07] windows he said so you don't want me to
[1:14:10] pray I will pray and I will open the
[1:14:14] windows so you can see me praying here
[1:14:17] is a man who had no
[1:14:19] fear brother sister when you are faced
[1:14:22] with adversity
[1:14:25] when you're faced with
[1:14:26] trouble face it like a man or woman of
[1:14:30] God have no fear to what the devil can
[1:14:33] do to
[1:14:35] you stand boldly before
[1:14:38] fear I will even open my
[1:14:42] windows because the God I
[1:14:44] serve can deliver
[1:14:47] me even if he doesn't believe me what
[1:14:51] good is it for me to fear
[1:14:54] I will not fear and he opened the
[1:14:57] windows and and they saw him praying so
[1:15:00] they quickly went to the king they sent
[1:15:03] A man is pray said which man one of
[1:15:07] yours here Daniel he said are you sure
[1:15:11] he said yes so they brought him said
[1:15:16] Dan if it was you would
[1:15:21] you have you been praying
[1:15:27] they did not actually said the truth
[1:15:29] because yeah I was likeing but
[1:15:33] exactly that is
[1:15:35] fear but Daniel said yes do what you
[1:15:39] will I have no fear why because I have
[1:15:42] the word of
[1:15:43] God I'm standing right on the Promises
[1:15:46] of
[1:15:47] God he knew that the prayer that David
[1:15:50] had
[1:15:52] prayed that when they would look to this
[1:15:56] Temple no matter where they
[1:15:58] are you would deliver them and he was
[1:16:02] praying looking towards the
[1:16:05] temple he was looking towards the
[1:16:08] promise not towards
[1:16:11] fear look beyond your
[1:16:13] fear I say look beyond your
[1:16:16] fear and see the promises of
[1:16:19] God they will shortly come to pass
[1:16:24] and right at that
[1:16:25] moment you know they said now you have
[1:16:29] to be thrown to the lion is
[1:16:32] den oh my good Lord if it was
[1:16:36] you maybe you would begin
[1:16:38] immediately
[1:16:40] shaking after all you're going to be
[1:16:42] thrown in the
[1:16:44] light and you wouldn't know that you
[1:16:46] wouldn't know what it is but you would
[1:16:47] hear
[1:16:49] water all over your
[1:16:52] pants
[1:16:55] you're going to be lion lunch
[1:16:59] today that's what the Bible says the
[1:17:02] devil is like a roing
[1:17:04] lion I said have no
[1:17:06] fear our God is not like a lowering
[1:17:10] lion our God is a
[1:17:13] lion of the tribe of
[1:17:15] Judah and he has prevailed over the
[1:17:19] devil oh hallelujah hallelujah and so
[1:17:22] right there
[1:17:24] you know when he was thrown in he had no
[1:17:26] fear and when he reached there the man
[1:17:29] had no fear the Lions looked at
[1:17:34] him hi
[1:17:39] Daniel so you're not eating
[1:17:41] me so you know me yeah Daniel we know
[1:17:45] you it's only a lion which has no
[1:17:48] fear and the lion saw Daniel as another
[1:17:52] lion
[1:17:54] because because another lion was in
[1:17:57] Daniel the Bible says that greater is he
[1:17:59] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:18:03] world it is the devil in the world that
[1:18:06] lays snares to make you
[1:18:10] fear but it is God that is in you that
[1:18:13] gives you
[1:18:15] boldness in the first of
[1:18:18] trouble and when he stood before that
[1:18:21] lion he had no
[1:18:24] fear he had no fear and he looked at the
[1:18:27] Lions and was singing and playing with
[1:18:29] them the whole
[1:18:31] time singing songs that man knows
[1:18:34] nothing
[1:18:37] about lion is so
[1:18:39] F when I was in
[1:18:42] Zimbabwe I touched a
[1:18:44] lion oh boy
[1:18:47] boy I I know then I knew what fear
[1:18:51] is when I touched that
[1:18:54] L I touched its
[1:18:57] rare and and just on the
[1:19:02] hip and I was just pressing it like that
[1:19:07] in just one second less than one
[1:19:10] second its mouth was where my finger
[1:19:18] was they told me yes that's how fast
[1:19:22] that Beast can be
[1:19:25] when did
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:30] thatw don't kill me it was it was in the
[1:19:34] net in in the whatever blocked
[1:19:38] somewhere but even then I don't know
[1:19:41] what I almost did I will not tell
[1:19:43] you fear is real but fear is a
[1:19:50] spirit but hallelujah hallelujah God has
[1:19:53] not given us the spirit of
[1:19:57] fear amen and so we notice there was
[1:20:00] another another people we always talk
[1:20:03] about
[1:20:07] them when these boys we told that you
[1:20:09] should not bow to any other God but only
[1:20:12] the the god this
[1:20:16] image when you hear the drums when you
[1:20:19] hear the what then bow down they
[1:20:22] remained standing they gave them another
[1:20:25] chance they remained
[1:20:27] standing I want you to understand this
[1:20:29] was an entire
[1:20:32] kingom bowing down but these three boys
[1:20:36] refuse to bow
[1:20:38] down even if you are the only one who
[1:20:40] shall refuse brother to bow down to the
[1:20:42] devil do not bow down to the
[1:20:47] devil even if everybody else would agree
[1:20:50] to
[1:20:51] bow I agree not to
[1:20:54] bow amen our
[1:20:57] strength is not in agreement with
[1:21:01] others our strength is in agreement with
[1:21:04] the
[1:21:05] word if you agree with the word then God
[1:21:09] is right beside you to accomplish his
[1:21:13] promise but agree with
[1:21:16] man man will forsake you at the time
[1:21:20] when you need them but cannot forsake
[1:21:23] you the Bible says the present
[1:21:28] help in the time of
[1:21:31] trouble and if you believe him like
[1:21:34] that even in the time of
[1:21:37] trouble you will have no
[1:21:39] fear what the devil will do against your
[1:21:43] life at that moment they said Will Not
[1:21:47] Bow look your boys we are going to burn
[1:21:50] up this furnace again and recind again
[1:21:53] and
[1:21:55] again seven times and if you don't bow
[1:21:59] we will throw you in there they said
[1:22:02] Bring it
[1:22:02] on Bring it on we will not bow to the
[1:22:07] condition of the
[1:22:09] time did you know that
[1:22:12] fear has never been
[1:22:14] holistic fear is
[1:22:16] always consequential it's
[1:22:21] like fear I don't know whether I said
[1:22:24] that right but fear is always for the
[1:22:30] moment how many of you feared at one
[1:22:32] point in
[1:22:35] life all right how many of you who that
[1:22:37] who feared at one point in
[1:22:40] life and then later on you realize why
[1:22:43] did I
[1:22:46] fear later
[1:22:49] on I remember when I was in school one
[1:22:52] time
[1:22:54] uh there was a teacher who usually here
[1:22:56] in Uganda I don't know whether they are
[1:22:57] beating these days do they beat now
[1:22:59] noways
[1:23:02] students yes some
[1:23:05] good oh we used to get Enzo
[1:23:09] really so now there was these teachers
[1:23:11] who would make you li like a
[1:23:15] snake and and he would bring
[1:23:20] thato and the English speakers will not
[1:23:23] understand what we're talking about BYO
[1:23:24] and but I don't know it would bring a
[1:23:28] stripe a rod it is just like a
[1:23:31] rod and and he would bring it down on
[1:23:36] you I I would say he would Rin it down
[1:23:38] on
[1:23:41] you and
[1:23:43] so uh he said this teacher would say
[1:23:46] anybody below this
[1:23:50] Mark I'm going to give give you
[1:23:53] five you you know you are
[1:23:56] gone so now then after he says that then
[1:24:01] he brings the
[1:24:02] papers even by the time he's bringing
[1:24:04] the
[1:24:06] papers you are
[1:24:08] shaking because not the way you
[1:24:12] perform you don't know whether you
[1:24:13] reached that
[1:24:15] Mar by the time by the time he brings
[1:24:17] your paper you
[1:24:21] already and by the time you look at your
[1:24:23] paper your hand is
[1:24:26] shaking and if you see you are P the
[1:24:31] mark you can even even fall down in
[1:24:36] appreciation you just feel
[1:24:39] fear but when you realize that you are
[1:24:42] below the
[1:24:45] mark you will go back to your
[1:24:48] chair but you you will feel it
[1:24:51] hot can't even sit down some of us would
[1:24:55] not
[1:24:55] sit would just kneel down there because
[1:24:59] you you you know you
[1:25:01] waiting to receive
[1:25:04] the and then one day the teacher did
[1:25:08] that and at the end of the day um you
[1:25:12] know he spoke and he spoke and he spoke
[1:25:14] the road was there he spoke and he
[1:25:18] spoke and this session
[1:25:20] ended he said you have
[1:25:24] survived you have survived but I was
[1:25:27] going
[1:25:28] to now we wonder now why did we
[1:25:31] fear after all he has not beaten us from
[1:25:35] that moment I said fear will no longer
[1:25:37] control
[1:25:38] me because I know after after the
[1:25:44] fear you will not fear again did you
[1:25:47] hear me after fear there is no
[1:25:49] fear fear is only for that moment
[1:25:54] but the devil will try to bring many
[1:25:55] things in your
[1:25:57] life which will bring fear in your
[1:26:00] spirit and these things many times may
[1:26:03] be
[1:26:05] sickness it may be words that you have
[1:26:08] heard it may be things that maybe people
[1:26:11] have done to you it may be anything and
[1:26:15] then all of the sudden to bring a
[1:26:17] blanket of fear
[1:26:19] over but this is only for a moment
[1:26:22] but the devil will show it to you as if
[1:26:24] it's for a
[1:26:27] lifetime maybe you don't have
[1:26:29] money I want to tell you it's only for a
[1:26:33] moment maybe you have not tution it's
[1:26:36] only for a moment maybe you are sick
[1:26:39] it's only for a
[1:26:40] moment maybe you have issues in your
[1:26:44] family or in the church it's only for a
[1:26:47] moment but I tell you what we have an
[1:26:50] eternal God
[1:26:53] who is over and Beyond a
[1:26:56] moment he an everlasting
[1:26:59] God there before fear he will be there
[1:27:03] after fear fear has no
[1:27:06] power before our
[1:27:08] living and all they that trust in him
[1:27:12] amen have no fear also for there is no
[1:27:15] fear in
[1:27:17] love and so we notice these boys said We
[1:27:20] Shall Not Bow
[1:27:23] do what you will they they they boiled
[1:27:26] up the
[1:27:27] fire seven times
[1:27:31] completion the fire was completely
[1:27:34] hot the devil might have boiled your
[1:27:39] mind and he even brings you know what we
[1:27:42] call
[1:27:44] nervousness nervous there are people who
[1:27:47] become
[1:27:50] nervous and then others
[1:27:52] begin to fear begin to feel kind of
[1:27:57] depression so sad you feel that that
[1:28:01] feeling has overwhelmed
[1:28:04] you but that comes out of
[1:28:08] fear and others think that when they go
[1:28:10] to the
[1:28:12] psychiatrist psychist will help them let
[1:28:15] me tell you what you need you only need
[1:28:18] a holy ghost filled
[1:28:20] person to to you and cast out that
[1:28:24] fear because fear is a
[1:28:27] spirit and he said fear brings
[1:28:30] torment that's why to a Believer who is
[1:28:33] walking right with God no matter what
[1:28:36] comes no matter what go you will have no
[1:28:40] fear what devil will do what devil will
[1:28:44] say what devil will why because you know
[1:28:47] where you are standing you are standing
[1:28:50] on a solid rock
[1:28:52] the Rock of Ages the rock of the world
[1:28:56] the three boys said we shall not have
[1:29:00] any
[1:29:01] fear as long as we know the
[1:29:03] promise and they took them they had no
[1:29:07] fear they pulled them they had no fear
[1:29:10] the devil might have taken you he might
[1:29:12] have pulled you he might have done
[1:29:14] whatever he to you but I say have no
[1:29:18] fear hallelujah amen where is taking
[1:29:23] you in the fire our God is a consuming
[1:29:29] fire amen when he dragged them to the
[1:29:34] fire all of them got
[1:29:38] burnt but the boys themselves were in
[1:29:42] the fire dancing thank God
[1:29:46] Hallelujah Glory hallelujah our god are
[1:29:49] consuming
[1:29:50] fire me tell you brother sister oh
[1:29:55] Hallelujah let me tell you why we listen
[1:29:58] to the word every
[1:29:59] time because the word casts out
[1:30:03] fear God is the word and the word is
[1:30:07] love says with God in love there is no
[1:30:13] fear perfect love cast out fear so when
[1:30:17] we hear the word you
[1:30:19] get praise God and I want to say to you
[1:30:22] this evening if the devil has dragged
[1:30:25] you in the
[1:30:27] fire don't fear because when you are in
[1:30:30] the fire you are in
[1:30:32] Victory why because he that made the
[1:30:36] fire is right there in the
[1:30:40] fire amen you pray oh God send a sign an
[1:30:45] angel send this one send a
[1:30:49] word and God may not answer all those PR
[1:30:53] if God has not oh there's somebody who
[1:30:55] asked a question here why do I feel God
[1:30:57] is not answering my
[1:30:59] prayer here is your answer if you feel
[1:31:02] that God is not answering your
[1:31:04] prayer he's waiting to answer it in a
[1:31:06] greater
[1:31:10] way why are pray oh God come and consume
[1:31:16] all come and strike the the
[1:31:20] image come and and when they caught them
[1:31:24] come and strike all of
[1:31:26] them
[1:31:28] nothing God was waiting the angels in
[1:31:31] heaven were like oh God your people are
[1:31:33] being taken your people are being taken
[1:31:36] let us go woman say Let Me Go
[1:31:40] water God said
[1:31:42] no okay let me go and bring fire no let
[1:31:46] me go and
[1:31:48] bring he stopped all the wind the
[1:31:51] because God was
[1:31:53] prepared to answer the call
[1:31:57] himself and when the king saw he said
[1:32:00] didn't we throw three men in the
[1:32:03] fire why do I see four and the first of
[1:32:08] one is like the son of
[1:32:12] man who was he who was he he is the one
[1:32:17] in
[1:32:18] you he is the one here they saw him as a
[1:32:23] separate one but you don't see him
[1:32:27] because he's in
[1:32:29] you that's why I told you you are
[1:32:31] greater than you
[1:32:34] know because he that is in us he's
[1:32:38] greater than he that is in the
[1:32:40] world he's greater than any
[1:32:42] discouragement of
[1:32:46] fear he came down in a moment and fire
[1:32:51] meant nothing
[1:32:54] so they had no
[1:32:55] fear but even if he did not serve
[1:32:58] them they were ready to
[1:33:00] die but not
[1:33:03] fearful they were not yes don't be
[1:33:06] fearful
[1:33:07] brother don't worry even if God doesn't
[1:33:09] save
[1:33:10] you
[1:33:12] die
[1:33:14] strong die
[1:33:17] Fearless die standing on the die believe
[1:33:22] it if God doesn't heal you don't you
[1:33:25] worry die like a
[1:33:27] warrior don't die like a fearful
[1:33:30] person die like a warrior but I want to

[1:33:36] able to deliver
[1:33:40] you some of said I can't overcome this I
[1:33:43] can't overcome this I can't overcome
[1:33:46] that Believers we are supposed to be
[1:33:50] soldiers we are fighting a
[1:33:53] battle and we are fighting until we

[1:34:10] that go out of the
[1:34:11] ring stay in the ring even if you open
[1:34:14] it is a
[1:34:16] giant fight with him until you overcome
[1:34:20] him if you don't overcome him die
[1:34:24] trying but I want to say our go has been
[1:34:30] tested Our God has been proved over and
[1:34:35] over
[1:34:36] and that he cannot fail that he does not
[1:34:40] fail it's not what about what I'm saying
[1:34:44] it's about what he's
[1:34:46] saying it has been time
[1:34:50] tested there are for wife
[1:34:53] here praise
[1:34:56] God just stay right with
[1:34:59] faith and hold on to
[1:35:01] it take God's
[1:35:04] promise and remain with
[1:35:07] God in the message in the church age
[1:35:11] book The Church
[1:35:14] age I'll read you this
[1:35:16] quartner God says this church of the Lan
[1:35:19] age is
[1:35:20] wred
[1:35:23] wretched or wretched or
[1:35:25] whatever that word comes from two Greek
[1:35:28] words which means endure and
[1:35:33] tri endure and
[1:35:36] tri endure and TR
[1:35:40] yes praise God and he says and it has
[1:35:44] nothing to do with the trials that come
[1:35:47] to a true Christian for God describes a
[1:35:49] Christian in trial as blessed
[1:35:56] this is not about a Christian because
[1:35:57] this is not the church
[1:36:02] ised
[1:36:04] wretched find the word in the in
[1:36:06] Revelation chapter
[1:36:08] three vers something
[1:36:11] there they're wretched and blind naked
[1:36:14] wretched and blind did you get it
[1:36:17] quickly we don't have much time now and
[1:36:19] it has nothing to do it says with the
[1:36:22] trials did you find it
[1:36:23] brother chapter
[1:36:26] 3 anybody found
[1:36:30] it vers 18 no no no vers
[1:36:36] um verse 17 because thou sayest I am
[1:36:39] rich and increased with goods and have
[1:36:41] need of nothing but thou knowest not
[1:36:43] that thou art wretched and miserable and
[1:36:45] poor and blind and
[1:36:49] naked s
[1:37:06] so the word comes from two which means
[1:37:08] endure and
[1:37:13] trial and it has nothing to do with the
[1:37:15] trials that come to a
[1:37:18] Christian because for God does not
[1:37:20] describe for God to a Christian he
[1:37:22] describes a trial as a as
[1:37:29] blessed and his attitude and his
[1:37:32] attitude one of joy is one of Joy
[1:37:34] whereas this description here is phrased
[1:37:38] as wretched and
[1:37:42] [Music]
[1:37:50] miserable
[1:37:52] how strange Listen Listen Now quickly
[1:37:54] now how
[1:37:56] strange in this age of
[1:37:59] Plenty in this age of progress in this
[1:38:02] age of
[1:38:04] abundance How can there be
[1:38:07] trials well now it is
[1:38:10] strange but in this age of Plenty and
[1:38:14] opportunity everyone has so much and
[1:38:16] there is so much more to be
[1:38:20] had he says what with all the inventions
[1:38:23] to do uh what with all the inventions to
[1:38:27] do our work and so many things to give
[1:38:29] us
[1:38:34] pleasure but
[1:38:36] suddenly we find mental
[1:38:40] illness taking such a toll as to alarm
[1:38:43] the
[1:38:48] nation even here in Uganda the mental
[1:38:51] are becoming more and
[1:38:54] more when everybody ought to be
[1:38:58] happy with really nothing to be unhappy
[1:39:02] about millions are taking sedatives at
[1:39:08] night I don't know how if there are
[1:39:10] people who do it
[1:39:13] here even many believers
[1:39:15] do let me tell you if you
[1:39:18] do if you do take ctiv to
[1:39:22] sleep oh it's not
[1:39:25] evil but I tell you you can be delivered
[1:39:27] off of
[1:39:29] that God can take you out of
[1:39:32] it because that is not your
[1:39:35] portion the Bible says he give his
[1:39:37] beloved
[1:39:42] sleep praise the name of the Lord and he
[1:39:45] says when everybody ought to be happy
[1:39:47] with really nothing to be unhappy
[1:39:50] about
[1:39:52] millions are taking stives at
[1:39:55] night he says P pills in the
[1:40:00] morning rushing to
[1:40:02] doctors entering
[1:40:06] institutions and nothing listen and
[1:40:10] trying to drown out unknown fears by
[1:40:19] alcohol
[1:40:22] they're trying to drown that
[1:40:24] fear with
[1:40:27] alcohol do you know many people who are
[1:40:29] taking alcohol and
[1:40:32] drugs because of
[1:40:35] fears they living in
[1:40:38] fear they in
[1:40:40] bondage yes this AG B of his tremendous
[1:40:43] stores of worldly
[1:40:47] Goods but the people are less happy than
[1:40:50] ever
[1:40:55] bsts of his spiritual
[1:40:58] attainments but people are less sure of
[1:41:01] themselves than
[1:41:04] ever this Ed of better moral
[1:41:09] values and it is more corrupt than any
[1:41:11] age since the
[1:41:16] flag it talks about his knowledge and
[1:41:19] science
[1:41:22] but it is fighting and losing a battle
[1:41:23] in all
[1:41:26] fields for the human
[1:41:29] mind and soul Spirit cannot
[1:41:37] comprehend keep ESS with all the changes
[1:41:40] that have come upon the
[1:41:45] Earth in one generation we have gone all
[1:41:47] the way from the horse and bu age to the
[1:41:49] Space Age
[1:41:54] and we are proud and blessful about
[1:41:57] it but this
[1:41:59] generation inside the
[1:42:01] peop is a Dark
[1:42:04] Void C that is crying out in
[1:42:10] torment you know the scripture said that
[1:42:13] fear has
[1:42:16] torment and without a known
[1:42:19] reason many's hearts are failing for
[1:42:27] fear and the world is so darkened that
[1:42:29] this age could well be called the age of
[1:42:32] neuro
[1:42:33] [Music]
[1:42:37] neurotics the wife is fearing a
[1:42:40] husband the husband is fearing his
[1:42:42] wife father's fearing son son is fearing
[1:42:46] daughter daughter is fearing you know
[1:42:49] brother
[1:42:51] there's fear
[1:42:52] everywhere the other time I heard there
[1:42:55] was a woman that powered hot water on a
[1:43:02] husband the man just walk up only to go
[1:43:05] to the
[1:43:06] hospital half
[1:43:08] dead
[1:43:10] why burned by the
[1:43:13] wife why maybe the woman had her
[1:43:18] fears or insecurities
[1:43:22] you find a phone someone has 20
[1:43:27] passwords someone just
[1:43:30] Scrolls the whole screen to put a
[1:43:34] password
[1:43:36] fears they have nothing on the
[1:43:38] phone no money
[1:43:40] nothing but
[1:43:42] Secrets what if Pastor finds
[1:43:45] out what if my wife finds out if you you
[1:43:49] have your secret password and your wife
[1:43:51] doesn't know there is a problem with you
[1:43:52] you have
[1:43:56] fear this is my phone this is your
[1:44:00] phone we settled that one long ago in my
[1:44:04] marriage say my wife we are one you have
[1:44:08] my password I have
[1:44:10] yours if a Thum
[1:44:12] print yours can open mine mine can open
[1:44:15] your when I'm sleeping I'm
[1:44:18] peaceful you can check all you want
[1:44:23] no fear when I go in the bathroom I can
[1:44:27] leave you with my
[1:44:28] phone you can check all you want you can
[1:44:32] search all you want I have no fear but
[1:44:35] what has the devil done fear what if
[1:44:39] they do this what I even have no fear
[1:44:41] even if she found something
[1:44:43] bad she will not come and beat me up she
[1:44:46] will not come and divorce me she'll ask
[1:44:48] me darling what is this and
[1:44:52] I and then we will talk it over and then
[1:44:55] we will kiss each other and that will
[1:44:59] be but what but what has the devil done
[1:45:03] fear and and he causes that kind of
[1:45:07] stress even in marriage
[1:45:10] relationship you know even the devil
[1:45:13] would want to you know the pastor is
[1:45:15] fearing the people the people
[1:45:17] fearing I've heard often times people
[1:45:19] say oh we fear pastor
[1:45:22] I hear it in some Churches I get shocked
[1:45:25] you a pastor well of course you have a
[1:45:28] right to fear if he walks with the
[1:45:29] guards with a
[1:45:33] gun maybe but in the message
[1:45:38] churches your pastor is your
[1:45:41] brother you fear your pastor what is
[1:45:44] wrong with you no because the past
[1:45:47] invite him to your house no one has ever
[1:45:49] invited me
[1:45:52] don't but I dare not go and push myself
[1:45:54] on the homes of the
[1:45:55] people I'm your pastor open we don't do
[1:45:59] that wherever Jesus was invited he
[1:46:03] go no fear no fear the spirit of fear is
[1:46:07] bad it brings
[1:46:10] nervousness it brings a
[1:46:13] torment and he says the generation is
[1:46:15] all in
[1:46:17] torment country is fearing another
[1:46:19] country
[1:46:21] you know are they going to are they
[1:46:23] going they keep spying on one
[1:46:26] another because of fear countries do
[1:46:30] that I hope people don't do
[1:46:33] that what what what are they saying what
[1:46:35] is he
[1:46:36] saying why because of
[1:46:39] fear Tor it brings
[1:46:42] torment people even I've seen many young
[1:46:46] people they're not confident of
[1:46:49] themselves of
[1:46:51] fear oh I I don't look nice my body is
[1:46:56] so
[1:46:57] tiny I'm so
[1:47:00] fat I fear how would they say what they
[1:47:03] think don't fear those kind of things
[1:47:07] fear comes from the
[1:47:08] devil what God has made
[1:47:11] you let me tell you is good and anybody
[1:47:15] that will not appreciate you is the
[1:47:19] devil why
[1:47:21] because he that believes in God should
[1:47:24] believe the word of God and the word of
[1:47:26] God says are fearfully and wonderfully
[1:47:32] made but the devil doesn't believe that
[1:47:35] but every believer believes
[1:47:37] that praise the name of the Lord and we
[1:47:40] don't fear what the devil thinks about
[1:47:43] us and without unknown reason many's
[1:47:45] hearts are fading for
[1:47:48] fear world is so
[1:47:51] darken that this age could well be
[1:47:53] called the age of
[1:47:58] neurotics boss but it cannot be back it
[1:48:02] up cries peace but there is no peace it
[1:48:07] cries that it has a great amplitude of
[1:48:09] all
[1:48:11] things but it keeps burning with desire
[1:48:17] fire there is no peace sa my God
[1:48:20] to the wicked there's no P the wicked
[1:48:23] but I want to finish like this I will
[1:48:25] not finish my sermon but I'm just
[1:48:27] finishing because of
[1:48:30] time just go back and read the thean
[1:48:33] church age very good nuggets
[1:48:36] there in Romans
[1:48:39] 8:15 he says you have not
[1:48:42] received a spirit of bondage against
[1:48:47] fear but he have received
[1:48:50] the spirit of
[1:48:52] adoption whereby we
[1:48:55] cry when you receive the spirit of
[1:48:59] adoption you are

[1:49:05] God you are not made a Son of
