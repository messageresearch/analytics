TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign foreign [Music] let us stand and go to the world I really appreciate each of you who like to remember ministers that are serving in the church we have been to the Book of Luke chapter 10 where they look us verses 30 to 37 we're just going to read seven verses let me invite you to First pray before we read Lord Jesus we humble ourselves help us not to speak our thoughts but your thoughts these are needy people Lord they just need you we all need you Lord be taken out of the way and just come and take over now I've been given um directly to your people directing your word to us individually let us work out over here today amen so we are reading verses 30. and Jesus answering said a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among Thieves which stripped him of his reignment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead yes and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise I lever it when he was at the place came and looked on and passed by on the other side but a certain Samaritan as a Janet came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds powering in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and bought him brought him rather to one in and took care of him and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the coast and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendeth more when I come again I will repay thee which now of these three thinkers thou was the neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves and he said he said he that he showed he that showed Mercy on him then say to Jesus unto him go and do thou likewise yes foreign [Music] that a people each of them is trying to do something man is suffering that's why we have a lot of organizations we have the UN United Nations we have uh what other organizations we have very many organizations that are trying to help the needy yeah trying to rescue the orphans are trying to rescue those who are infamine against many organizations that are trying to rescue the people that are in need different types of needs others are trying to rescue those people who are taking drugs others are rescuing single mothers you know you go there and you tell them your problems and they rescue you [Music] God is interested foreign are you hearing me yes how much you know tell your neighbor God is entrusted in you because we are souls for God next job you should be able to rescue Souls children what do you think that he has done many other games you know people have their many programs people have started churches people have started organizations and they are saying they are rescuing souls and they are all saying they're rescuing Souls [Music] they are helping the people to live religiously the Bible in the Book of Amos Hallelujah he says foreign are you hearing yes how much you know if you're hearing me say Amen then I know you are here if you're not understanding what I'm talking about very soon you'll understand it's not going to to start an organization is not going to start a hospital hospital to rescue Souls God is going to do nothing but he will send a prophet he will send a prophet with a message the souls that are lost so I'm here today that is what this church stands foreign as long as they don't receive the whole world as long as they teach things there are just traditions of men there are ideas of men yes doctrines they are still living in sins but God has sent a message not only in Ethiopia all over the world [Music] you are seeing all the filthy things are coming from the developed world coming from Europe and America but make no mistake even in those countries God must rescue the souls God is going to rescue them from everyone and when it comes to Ethiopia God is going to rescue them to every area not only at this even from foreign Amen in the message the power of decision let me just lay this foundation for you here yes God had rained down Manna Out of Heaven that's a very beautiful type of Christ coming down from heaven to die on Earth crystals to perish on Earth Jesus came to perish on Earth that he might rescue the perishing but because of time let me go to this man here okay he was coming from Jerusalem to Jericho whether yarico in the story which we have read and you know he was coming from Jerusalem to Jericho okay so that's a bad place to work this is a bad road to work but um I wish she was coming from Jericho to Jerusalem was the city of God where God had his house where are you it was the right place to go where the word of God is the right place for us to go when you teach baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ foreign on [Music] [Music] they left him almost half dead foreign this is what the denominations have done I want yeah the people so much desire God someone like I don't know whether it is here but I believe it is because I have spoken to a few people someone comes to a pastor and the owners are Pastor I'm going through this problem I have a solution for you by anointing oil foreign foreign blessing [Applause] is that what is that Amen to know that souls are perishing and they are in those churches [Music] the Bible says Saturn has become has made himself an angel of Light and because of that he has preachers to be preachers of righteousness on behalf of God but when the people Baka they are being battered liquor instead of going to Jerusalem they are very busy going to Jericho and I can tell you that many people like that our generation don't know where the truth is foreign but they never heard of this person no religion is going to help the people yes we are introducing you to Jesus that will rescue your soul that will bring you to something that can change your soul and fill you with the Holy ghosts and make you go out and do the same God praise God yeah so this man fell to the city and Jesus spoke and said foreign then Jesus said unto them again very very same to you I am the door to the Sheep all that ever came before me a thieves and robbers but a sheep did not hear them I'm burning up with Revelation right now I was born in the Anglican Church I thought I was going to be a priest myself and as I was studying the Bible I was reading the whole Bible I got questions about my religions ask the questions [Music] but in my soul I was yearning for more truths my soul was I was perishing I never said yeah I needed something to rescue me and one day hallelujah hallelujah one day and again someone told me Prophets The Bible that Bible teachings with a message of restoration not a new message and this Prophet has come and gone and he told me we have this message we have this message I told you foreign [Music] foreign [Music] but what he said get him into that I am and hey Jesus himself the word himself he said I am the door to the Sheep never go to paranarena praise God and then he says for I am the door of the ship all that came before me we have thieves and robots they are robbing people is it will have the life of Jesus following it yes and not only the life he were to return but the power the true message how shall these things for the power of the Holy ghosts this message we are preaching to your church this message anybody that believes this message their life will change we will not even tell you to stop smoking the smoking shall go foreign yeah man like your pastor wanted to be wanted to be a politician level you wanted to be the Prime Minister he has what it takes but one day she met him he met the word ambition his ambition was to kill every believer to imprison them that was his ambition one day and again what did he meets the pillar of fire yes the same that was with Moses with the children of Israel in the in the deserts foreign and the voice told him I am who I am but poor soul met the same Pillar of Fire yeah and he said I remember Moses Moses asked the same questions now God has visited me and I'm doing his work by killing the Christians I want him to introduce himself to me who are you my lord yes Jesus I don't know of the Old Testament is the Jesus Jesus is Lord yes that is why we say Jesus is Lord Jesus Jehovah means God is our Salvation Jesus means God is our salvation foreign [Music] honestly it doesn't matter what you think in your mind the word says my way is not your way some of you who are questioning this message right now okay but let me tell you a little more the mistake you have done yesterday is to come here because you are hearing the word the word is a seat yes [Music] foreign did you hear that did they hear that tell your neighbors saves and robots I want you to preach with me so you don't dance we are repeating the words of Jesus we are thieves foreign but the Sheep did not hear them I believe I am a ship coming that's why when we hear the word of God we bleed like a ship no no but if you were God when the world comes [Music] but thank God all of you asleep and he said the Sheep did not hear the thieves and robbers he says I am the door anybody If any man enters he shall be saved because of receiving this message I want to tell you foreign the reason why I stand come on pastors why I stand behind my pastor capacity is because yes Hallelujah because of this thing here he's preaching the world I am not following him because he's very handsome I am not following him because he speaks very well I am not following him because he has good money a lot of money so if you are here because your past is helping you sorry Pastor you must follow your pastor Pastor you must accept his leadership because he is preaching to you the one I thank God for a god-cold man be comfortably behind us knowing is not leading me to himself that can help and scratch them um what are those pastors when you bring the word the people who does so the pasta is very good answer today [Music] laughs I speak prophecy they even ask these days do you want to hear from above or from the world my above is if you bring your above which is not here that one belongs to hell yeah and any good cold man we lead His People based on the world why we have a message he's saying come out of there my people this is those who are only giving us foreign it has been sent for foreign [Applause] hallelujah amen we must come out of them those who wait for prophecy so that they can shout those who wait for presumptuous talk so they can dance oh my God oh my God praise God let me skip this he that laid down his life is the real Shepherd foreign that's a life without God foreign [Music] the reason why I believe this message and began running with it at 15 years because you see this man was stripped of all his rement the book in the Bible the Book of Revelation 3. because you say laodice they're saying we are rich I'm rich with the goods and have need of Nothing But The Generation says Michigan yes he was naked the denominations and the system of this generation the demons they have come to Stripes both spiritually and physically the physical type is the spirituality if you want to know whether a church is look at the women in that church the one who is saying is a pastor's wife she can't even work well [Music] and then those long high heels and then she begins working with our nails all painted red button and she works on the pulpit and Nanda is the pastor's wife so she comes this is it the Bible says naked and they don't know the devil has removed the clothes from the women of Our Generation they have a form of godliness to change them the power that changes with them is the word yeah but they have refused where the word says a woman said must dress in mother's apparently Christ man cover your body so cover your body a woman say touch lips is the devil who has removed the clothes but thank God for the counselves that you may be close why are our sisters dressed properly why did you throw away makeup because when you saw in the world you realize you're beautiful foreign so when you see yourself in the middle sister you see the beauty that God gave you exactly I don't need makeup make a password when you look at your ears in the mirror status you don't need to be targeted like a cow look in the buddy when you see yourself in the mirror you realize your body is sacred sourness that comes by an entire message praise God amen praise God hallelujah I was going to read a quote from the Sedition Church age but I have no time well I'll just try to wrap it all up and you know you know then then Jesus gives this story and it says that you know he took this man to himself [Music] he picked this man and he powered and he says he took him and he saw the wounds oils on his ass or whatever it was on his Beast Celestia foreign [Music] mm-hmm oil and wine okay at least allow me to read this quote for you it says um oil symbolizes the spirit the Holy Spirit I will give you a few verses if you want to okay let's do scriptures in Leviticus 8 12. before he went in he had to be Anointed with oil through the pipes Hallelujah cooler foreign what's the best car is going to be quiet what is that in your language I don't know get it now you're going to be starred stand again I'm not surprised foreign foreign why love it the man is stimulated but yes he is intoxicated intoxicated he is fired up brother and he's happy if I know a happy man is a drunken man that's why they're always laughing lessons [Music] [Applause] foreign foreign foreign all your problems there are many ways I can approach this but God has led me to approach it this way so I wanted to understand your attention when I was preaching this at home I gave a testimony of you sister um when she came to the church but she's not the most happiest God man doesn't do that against you God does that by the way somebody happy this is the Holy Ghost on power Memphis is keeping me alive he's keeping me alive what is this message is keeping me alive you have brought sadness foreign foreign bring yourself sit under the word hear the word and also depression is a bad Spirit yeah depression but um and then now after that he brought this person foreign [Music] is the in but this church here but this is [Music] I've had many people who say well you if I believe I'm filled with the Holy Ghost I don't need to go to church but as far as I'm concerned and it's come up with the gospel of Christ will take you to the Inn weather has hired preachers foreign most of us we have about 100 people but most of them are students I'll ask the trustees the treasurer how much do we have a minute and I have to go to church and preach so as I'm studying The Devil Is Telling Me Remember You have nothing in the choice people you are laboring to preach today they don't have what to give foreign Jesus as Jesus the one who rescued this man amen who was typed in this story he's the one who gave us he didn't give a lot because he's already put it in here let me tell you Church despise these preachers they are sent by God to help you here and say brother but he will lead you through he says give him respects even if the housekeeper went and decided to sit to sit outside for the whole yeah the sick man was left with him decided to leave the Phillips will find him again [Music] wake up all of us have been there that is what he didn't give you if it is too much for you guys and he says don't worry you spend to create love is that was for the minister but I want to conclude yeah you find the caretakers the ministers but because of time I want read but you see the minister takes care of you guys to heal the wounds give you strength [Music] we come here to receive strength foreign amen amen in the message he says there is some here been wounded friends I know there are some visitors here but I invite you for this moment as I read this quote just take a moment and close your eyes I can just sense the presence of the Holy Spirit here as I even read that one line and it says there's some here that's been wounded says Lord the enemy has shot the dots of sickness into their body the dance of afflictions yeah good at manifest but it says there are warriors laying here on the battlefield that will be going up and going if but they are must be taken to the Inn where
