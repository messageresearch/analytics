[33:26] is
[33:40] foreign foreign
[34:37] but one of them made it
[34:39] yesterday and as we were working
[34:42] together with him he had this question
[34:46] yeah and I wanted to discuss uh to talk
[34:49] about this to tonight because I've had
[34:51] discussion from a lot of young people
[34:54] foreign
[35:32] but they are from
[35:35] where
[35:38] you don't remember also
[35:39] okay but they're from Western Uganda
[35:41] neighbor
[35:43] in Western Uganda so they say the the
[35:47] they've been following our meetings
[35:48] online and they were blessed very much
[35:57] amen amen and so
[36:00] um there are many more people who listen
[36:02] to our services
[36:05] and we thank God for internet because
[36:07] then we can be able to get the word to
[36:09] more people
[36:14] praise the name of the Lord and so many
[36:17] young people have asked me these
[36:18] questions
[36:19] [Music]
[36:20] how do they know that they are called
[36:22] into the ministry
[36:27] or how do you know you have a Ministry
[36:32] how can you make proof of it
[36:36] so how can you be sure that this is what
[36:39] God called you today
[36:56] and so I was sharing what I'm going to
[36:59] share this evening with one of the
[37:01] younger brothers
[37:03] [Music]
[37:08] and after we concluded
[37:11] then at the end of it we we started
[37:15] talking about the holy spirit
[37:19] says if you want to you want angels to
[37:23] appearance
[37:25] talk about Jesus Christ talk about him
[37:29] and whenever you talk about him he shows
[37:31] up
[37:32] do you believe that and you know he was
[37:37] he began to tell me
[37:39] you know how he has desired in his heart
[37:43] to receive the Holy Spirit
[37:46] and you know he's been preaching for a
[37:49] little while
[37:50] and so
[37:52] um but I asked him I just ask him but do
[37:54] you have the Holy Spirit
[37:58] [Music]
[37:59] I felt bad in my heart because
[38:06] do you believe yourself
[38:08] God said yes
[38:10] what about if the devil came here and
[38:12] told you you are not safe
[38:17] he said no I said why he said because I
[38:22] have a revelation
[38:24] revealed to me that I'm saved
[38:27] Jesus died for me on the cross yes
[38:30] I believe I'm saying so I told him it's
[38:33] the same way
[38:34] with the Holy Spirit until you received
[38:37] the Revelation
[38:40] it is for you just like you receive a
[38:44] revelation
[38:45] the blood that Jesus said on the cross
[38:47] of Calvary
[38:51] and when you receive that Revelation you
[38:54] are not there
[38:55] but you believe it is
[38:59] you believe it is applied upon your life
[39:02] and it is the same way with the Holy
[39:05] Spirit foreign
[39:57] amen I I don't know what the neighbors
[40:00] thought and the other people but we just
[40:02] you know we were rejoicing in the middle
[40:04] yeah
[40:08] hallelujah amen
[40:11] because of you who don't believe it I
[40:13] believe it
[40:15] God still fills with the holy spirit
[40:18] let me tell you if you don't have the
[40:20] Holy Spirit you must receive him before
[40:23] the Rapture
[40:25] because if the Rapture comes and you
[40:27] don't have him you are going to stay in
[40:29] the tribulation
[40:33] praise the name of the Lord
[40:36] so this evening I'd like us to speak on
[40:39] the pattern for every true Ministry
[40:47] there is a pattern
[40:50] that God said
[40:53] that you will find in every true
[40:56] minister or Ministry
[41:02] in Romans chapter 12 verse
[41:07] let us first read there for us we have
[41:10] many members in one body and all members
[41:13] have not the same office so we being
[41:16] many are one body in Christ and everyone
[41:20] members of members one over another
[41:23] having then gifts deferring according to
[41:26] the grace that is given to us whether
[41:29] prophecy let us prophesy according to
[41:32] the proportion of Faith or Ministry let
[41:35] us wait on our ministering or he that
[41:39] teacheth on teaching or he that
[41:41] exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth
[41:43] let him do it with Simplicity he that
[41:46] ruleth with diligence he that slows show
[41:49] us Mercy with cheerfulness
[41:52] foreign
[42:29] [Music]
[43:16] [Applause]
[43:20] you cannot just be an idea
[43:37] and in the same way the body of Christ
[43:40] must be a lively body
[43:44] it must be a living body
[43:48] and you know each of us we are members
[43:51] of that body
[43:54] we are parts of that body
[43:58] what part are you category do you know
[44:01] the part you are um when I stand on the
[44:05] pulpit and I preach to you I might be
[44:06] the mouth
[44:09] but I'm not I'm not everything
[44:13] what are you going to each of us is
[44:16] important
[44:17] each of you is important
[44:20] and there's no more important people
[45:21] foreign chicken
[46:22] days that original
[46:25] inactive
[46:27] but when you receive the holy ghosts
[46:32] that those dead Parts in you Allah
[46:37] and puts them into action
[46:40] and you become an active member of them
[46:44] Hallelujah man before you receive the
[46:47] Holy Ghost you are just
[46:50] a nominal church member
[46:54] I don't want us to be nominal church
[46:56] members
[46:57] I want us to be true members
[47:04] but I'm talking about the body of Christ
[47:08] but now how many people you know they
[47:12] find many times themselves doing things
[47:15] [Music]
[47:17] and they've always wanted to know is
[47:19] this my place
[47:22] you know you find yourself behind the
[47:24] pulpit and then you wonder is this your
[47:26] place
[47:30] you know maybe you're a mother is that
[47:32] your place
[47:34] maybe you are playing the piano is that
[47:37] your place
[47:38] maybe you go out to preach on the
[47:41] streets is that your place
[47:44] how can you be able to know
[47:48] for sure that that is your place
[47:51] how can the rest be able to know
[47:55] that is your place
[47:58] everybody must be able to know
[48:02] that is your place
[48:04] Jesus
[48:07] it's not Pastor telling brother buddy
[48:10] brother the ball come and preaching
[48:14] brother Billy Paul when you come to
[48:16] preach
[48:18] we will know whether you are you you are
[48:22] in the right position of ministry
[48:27] but how can we know
[48:29] there is a pattern one way we call that
[48:33] God has said
[48:34] how can you be able to know um
[48:39] they are preaching the truth
[48:41] the ministry there is the true Ministry
[48:46] how can you be able to know there must
[48:49] surely be a way
[48:51] we cannot just guess
[48:54] we go to this church
[48:57] and then when you find the addressing so
[49:00] nice
[49:04] and then you say oh they have good music
[49:09] we have a pattern to the name called a
[49:13] Bible pattern on how to know a true
[49:17] Ministry
[49:21] and here is what I want us to go through
[49:23] tonight
[49:25] praise the name of the Lord
[49:27] Paul founded the church at Ephesus
[49:30] [Music]
[49:32] about the middle of the first century
[49:37] and he says
[49:39] his manner of ministering set the
[49:42] pattern that all future Messengers were
[49:45] to Aspire to
[49:47] exam yet
[49:54] praise the name of the Lord
[49:57] Paul was this was the one who set the
[50:00] pattern
[50:04] that's all
[50:09] very much
[50:14] how many America
[50:17] seven Messengers to seven Church
[50:20] churches in every church
[50:27] was the first message
[50:35] and that pattern was supposed to be
[50:38] followed by all the other ministers or
[50:41] Messengers after him
[50:46] [Music]
[51:41] it must follow the first pattern
[51:45] now here he says and actually he sets
[51:48] the pattern for every true minister of
[51:50] God take it away
[51:54] every true Minister
[51:57] follows that same pattern
[52:00] though he would not attain to such
[52:02] Heights in the prophetic realm as did
[52:05] Paul what there is
[52:33] and this is what every true minister
[52:40] this is what they must have
[52:42] he says first of all
[52:45] Paul was absolutely true to the world
[52:53] never deviated from it no matter what
[52:56] the cause
[53:00] you want to know whether you were you
[53:03] were called to be a preacher
[53:06] praise the name of the Lord
[53:09] hallelujah hallelujah I don't know
[53:11] whether my ears have a problem but this
[53:13] is loud it's just loud but you know you
[53:15] need to but someone help him to hear
[53:18] until you you know it is very good it's
[53:21] just loud I wanted to be a bit calm
[53:24] not reduced but come
[53:28] praise the name of the Lord
[53:31] hallelujah hallelujah
[53:36] first of all
[53:38] ah Paul was absolutely true to the world
[53:41] [Music]
[53:45] deviated from it no matter what the cost
[53:49] foreign
[54:00] [Music]
[55:12] foreign
[56:18] as we said before so say I now again if
[56:22] any man preach any other gospel unto you
[56:24] then that which you have received let
[56:25] him be a cast
[56:38] now today you can see that there are
[56:40] many people who are preaching another
[56:41] gospels
[56:48] and even in this message you find people
[56:52] who claim to believe the message
[56:54] but when they have other Revelations
[57:07] God gave only one man the authority to
[57:11] interpret the word
[57:17] because God is his own Divine
[57:19] interpreter
[57:23] God interprets his own word
[57:27] and what does he do
[57:29] sends prophets
[57:31] and when a prophet comes a prophet comes
[57:36] with thus saith the Lord
[57:40] the prophet is interpretation of the
[57:43] world
[57:44] it is not his idea
[57:47] it is the true word of God
[57:57] when God sends a preacher
[58:00] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[58:03] are you following me this evening
[58:06] really the sound of man is really doing
[58:08] me bad tonight
[58:13] here
[58:14] the word ichigambo I've had many people
[58:19] try to debate
[58:22] [Music]
[58:24] what the prophet said
[58:26] and they have their own opinions
[58:32] they try to take the Bible
[58:34] you know and they compare it
[58:37] to the message and they said the Bible
[58:42] and the message
[58:43] did you hear what I said they said the
[58:47] Bible and a message they are lacking
[58:50] Revelations
[58:53] the Bible and the message is the same
[58:55] thing Bible is
[58:59] how many believe that
[59:01] when Paul was giving his message
[59:05] did he have a Bible
[59:09] did he have a Bible yeah
[59:17] all right now I have you there you are
[59:21] saying
[59:23] well I can say he had the Bible of those
[59:26] days
[59:29] because those were the books of the Old
[59:31] Testament
[59:33] it was
[59:35] present at the time
[59:38] many many times
[59:42] but now when he was preaching
[59:45] what he was preaching what was it
[59:49] charity what was it charity come on
[59:53] shout on top of your voice
[59:55] Hallelujah it was the message
[59:57] what he was preaching was the mercy
[1:00:02] let me ask you was the message that he
[1:00:05] was preaching
[1:00:07] different from the Bible
[1:00:11] no not at all
[1:00:15] but yet in the Bible
[1:00:17] which he had at that time
[1:00:21] it was saying that man must be
[1:00:23] circumcised
[1:00:28] and Paul came with the message
[1:00:31] and he said whoever you are circumcised
[1:00:33] or not
[1:00:34] [Music]
[1:00:36] it does not matter
[1:00:39] in Christ it doesn't matter
[1:00:42] so can you now compare the Bible and the
[1:00:45] message of Paul okay
[1:00:54] but people in that day did not believe
[1:00:57] it
[1:00:59] because it seemed as if Paul's message
[1:01:02] was contradicting with the Bible times
[1:01:10] message can never contradict with the
[1:01:13] Bible
[1:01:15] foreign
[1:01:30] [Applause]
[1:02:01] can we say it's a message of a man
[1:02:03] dreams
[1:02:09] because it was not the message
[1:02:12] it was the word of God for our day
[1:02:20] and
[1:02:22] the pattern of it of that of a true
[1:02:24] Minister
[1:02:27] the first thing he says he will be
[1:02:30] absolutely true to the word chances
[1:02:36] so what is the word the word comes to
[1:02:40] the prophet in your generation
[1:02:44] the way he interprets it for you in your
[1:02:47] generation
[1:02:51] you must say stay true to that
[1:02:55] when you deviate away
[1:03:00] that that is not a true Ministry
[1:03:05] and when Paul received the message
[1:03:18] and now today we have people
[1:03:22] foreign
[1:03:58] God bless you it's not wrong it doesn't
[1:04:02] matter where we play since I can play it
[1:04:05] at home
[1:04:06] when we are driving even in the church
[1:04:09] what is wrong with that nothing wrong
[1:04:12] with that at all
[1:04:13] but where someone says
[1:04:18] teachers should not preach
[1:04:20] they should sit down and then the tape
[1:04:24] only should preach
[1:04:26] now we know they are deviating away from
[1:04:29] the true word of God
[1:04:33] we know that they are not true ministers
[1:04:36] Hallelujah
[1:04:40] praise the name of the Lord
[1:04:46] but when Peter was come and to Antioch
[1:04:50] I withstood him to he to the face
[1:04:53] because he was to be blamed
[1:04:56] but when I saw that they walked not
[1:04:59] operately according to the truth of the
[1:05:01] Gospel
[1:05:04] I said unto Peter before them all
[1:05:07] without being a Jew
[1:05:10] give yourself the demand of Gentiles
[1:05:13] and not as do the Jews
[1:05:16] why do you compare these Gentiles also
[1:05:19] to live as Jews
[1:05:23] yeah I want you to follow me here
[1:05:25] closely here is a man called Paul
[1:05:30] and Paul was a preacher
[1:05:33] but Paul was the junior
[1:05:37] he came after all the disciples
[1:05:40] Peter was like the pastor of the first
[1:05:43] church
[1:05:46] and Peter had preached and baptized many
[1:05:52] and Peter had moved with Jesus for many
[1:05:54] days
[1:05:56] and then
[1:05:58] Paul came on the scene and his ministry
[1:06:02] started
[1:06:04] and here is what he's saying
[1:06:08] I stood when Peter was come to Antioch
[1:06:12] baited away I withstood him to the face
[1:06:18] because he was to be blameda and Soviet
[1:06:23] are you hearing that
[1:06:24] Paul disagreed with Peter Paulo
[1:06:31] no Paul disagreed with Peter since
[1:06:43] Paul disagreed
[1:06:46] and when he disagreed he did not keep
[1:06:50] quiet he will not say I will not speak
[1:06:54] because how will the others how will the
[1:06:56] pastors
[1:06:58] when he tells me to preach
[1:07:00] and then I talk I touched this part
[1:07:03] I will not touch that part because I may
[1:07:07] be annoyed
[1:07:09] if you are a god called the preacher
[1:07:12] if you have a true Ministry
[1:07:15] you will not preach to please anybody
[1:07:21] appease
[1:07:26] let me tell you if God called you to
[1:07:30] preach
[1:07:31] foreign
[1:07:59] [Applause]
[1:08:54] If any man think himself to be a prophet
[1:08:57] or spiritual let him acknowledge that
[1:08:59] the things I write unto you are the
[1:09:00] Commandments of the Lord
[1:09:10] hallelujah Paul was able to establish
[1:09:15] that what he was speaking was not his
[1:09:17] thoughts
[1:09:20] what he was speaking was the word of God
[1:09:24] you know I've seen many people
[1:09:28] that brother Branham can interpret for
[1:09:31] them some things but some things they
[1:09:33] don't need brother banam to
[1:09:34] interpretation
[1:09:40] I told you this is a foundational
[1:09:42] message I want you to listen to me very
[1:09:43] much
[1:09:46] and I know what I'm talking about
[1:09:49] I went to Nigeria one day in Nigeria and
[1:09:52] I met a pastor
[1:09:55] his church is a crowded
[1:09:58] tens of thousands yes
[1:10:04] [Music]
[1:10:07] and so when I I arrived there when I
[1:10:10] took Ayo you know I noticed that the
[1:10:13] sudden he believes the message
[1:10:16] apparently he believed
[1:10:20] so when I arrived there I noticed that
[1:10:24] I'm in the church
[1:10:26] sisters were using Vape
[1:10:32] on their heads all of them
[1:10:36] and then
[1:10:38] sisters would come and they would be
[1:10:40] given a microphone
[1:10:43] in the name of prophesy
[1:10:46] so they would prophesy like for 30
[1:10:48] minutes
[1:11:01] you don't know what it is like what like
[1:11:04] what here does
[1:11:09] blessing water and the people use it
[1:11:13] what to do where the pain is
[1:11:17] so I sat with him because I have started
[1:11:20] the message
[1:11:22] listen friend some of us came from
[1:11:24] denominations
[1:11:26] and when we came we were convinced that
[1:11:29] brother banam was the prophet of Malachi
[1:11:31] 4.
[1:11:34] we were convinced he was the prophet who
[1:11:37] would reveal whose message
[1:11:43] we were convinced that the mystery of
[1:11:45] God would be finished
[1:11:50] we were convinced that his message amen
[1:11:53] because of his message
[1:12:13] because it is worth living foreign
[1:12:56] when I'm preaching to you here I quote
[1:12:59] for you from the message here is what
[1:13:01] the prophet says
[1:13:07] why because what he said is the word of
[1:13:12] the Lord for this hour
[1:13:17] is the revelation of God of the word of
[1:13:19] God
[1:13:21] because the word of God comes to a
[1:13:24] prophet
[1:13:26] it doesn't come to an apostle to a
[1:13:29] preacher to a pastor
[1:13:31] comes to a prophet in our generation
[1:13:35] and we believe we have a prophet in Our
[1:13:37] Generations
[1:13:46] if I have a true Ministry
[1:13:54] myself through to the interpretation of
[1:13:57] that word
[1:14:01] sent to Our Generation by a prophet
[1:14:07] hallelujah amen you are Faith must not
[1:14:10] be in my Ministry
[1:14:14] please
[1:14:42] they're following a man's Ministry
[1:14:46] you know even the churches are called
[1:14:48] after the names of the pastors
[1:14:52] let us
[1:15:27] with me and my wife in my chest
[1:16:01] we must understand that this message is
[1:16:05] no longer after personalities
[1:16:21] that's why the bride is interested in
[1:16:25] that's why a true God called Pastor um
[1:16:30] messenger of your death said about every
[1:16:33] matter he preaches to you
[1:16:37] um
[1:16:47] and you know I I was I look like a very
[1:16:50] small man
[1:16:52] in the presence of this past of this
[1:16:55] huge assembly
[1:16:59] thousand people
[1:17:03] and I sat there and we started talking
[1:17:07] and I asked him I said I have a question
[1:17:10] for you
[1:17:11] also he said you can go on I said
[1:17:16] tell me where do you get this idea of
[1:17:19] sisters using a veil
[1:17:23] because yet
[1:18:27] because I'm
[1:18:36] another service
[1:18:44] explains
[1:18:46] the substance on the issue of the hair
[1:18:50] and it says a woman should not cut her
[1:18:52] hair
[1:18:54] unbeliever sisters you know you should
[1:18:56] not cut your hair
[1:18:59] you know you have another right vowel
[1:19:05] sisters did you know that if you say
[1:19:07] Amen
[1:20:00] which one is here
[1:20:09] and that is his interpretation
[1:20:13] and every woman among all those tens of
[1:20:15] thousands that each of them had
[1:20:16] available
[1:20:21] and then on other things
[1:20:23] he says some he needs others he doesn't
[1:20:30] matter every minute
[1:20:34] and he claims to believe this message
[1:20:44] right now he disclaimed the message
[1:20:52] yet he looked when you hear his
[1:20:54] preaching
[1:20:56] it was so powerful but now he's saying
[1:20:59] I'm ashamed of what I used to say hey
[1:21:08] ashamed of the message
[1:21:10] he had his own Revelations
[1:21:16] for me I appreciate the past as God
[1:21:19] gives us
[1:21:22] a pastor who will stay in the message of
[1:21:25] the hour
[1:21:27] um
[1:21:32] one of the qualities is you will
[1:21:34] absolutely be true to the world
[1:21:43] no matter what the cause
[1:21:56] even if you feel the messenger was wrong
[1:22:00] you understand it better
[1:22:03] you understand it better
[1:22:06] remember you are not a messenger who got
[1:22:08] Vindicated
[1:22:13] there is one Vindicated messenger in a
[1:22:16] generation
[1:22:18] is the interpretation of the world is
[1:22:23] the true word of God church
[1:22:29] that is
[1:22:44] they have just shown themselves
[1:22:49] notice that Paul was unorganized
[1:22:55] he was unorganized
[1:23:02] unorganized
[1:23:04] but it means he was not having an
[1:23:06] organization
[1:23:13] he was Spirit laid
[1:23:16] as when God moved upon Moses to lead
[1:23:19] Israel out of Egypt
[1:23:22] Jerusalem's Council never sent Paul out
[1:23:26] is
[1:23:28] no they didn't have any power or
[1:23:30] jurisdiction over him
[1:23:34] telling you the quietness of a true
[1:23:36] Ministry
[1:23:39] praise the name of the Lord one of them
[1:23:43] we are still on one of them actually the
[1:23:45] first one
[1:23:46] the first one so he will be true to the
[1:23:49] world
[1:23:52] that Paul was not under any organization
[1:23:57] a true Minister will not be led by an
[1:24:00] organization
[1:24:03] a true minister is
[1:24:06] [Applause]
[1:24:08] a true Minister when God moves he moves
[1:24:23] that's why in the message
[1:24:25] every church is independent yeah
[1:24:44] we are led by God by the word
[1:24:49] we are not led by organizations
[1:24:59] hallelujah amen that's why the message
[1:25:03] we don't believe in a pastor being a
[1:25:05] pastor of many churches
[1:25:11] and that's a wrong Spirit
[1:25:14] that's why we notice that eating first
[1:25:18] was the seed or the deed of the
[1:25:20] Nicolaitans
[1:25:29] they put people
[1:25:32] under bondage and to ever take away the
[1:25:37] men Leading Men
[1:25:40] has always wanted a ruler
[1:25:47] and in the denominations
[1:25:49] you find the churches
[1:25:51] this one is
[1:25:57] the headquarter of days of the voice
[1:26:01] of the voice so now we will go and start
[1:26:05] branches the days of the voice of the
[1:26:09] voice Ginger there is
[1:26:12] a denomination you don't even care
[1:26:14] whether there is another church
[1:26:18] even if it's a message
[1:26:24] for us we are planting here
[1:26:33] you put days of the voice
[1:26:36] and in all those branches
[1:26:47] Chicago
[1:26:57] and let me tell you that's the truth
[1:27:03] every pasta
[1:27:06] that is
[1:27:18] foreign
[1:28:06] and that's how you know a true Ministry
[1:28:12] Hallelujah Amina Paul was not of men but
[1:28:16] of God
[1:28:19] this isn't a message
[1:28:28] Hallelujah
[1:28:32] that's the first pattern
[1:28:35] so there is much I can preach about it
[1:28:38] but for the interest of time let me go
[1:28:39] to the seconds
[1:28:42] so the first one is
[1:28:45] the minister will absolutely be true to
[1:28:48] the world
[1:28:52] what is the word the reviewed word of
[1:28:56] the house
[1:29:11] thereby demonstrating the spoken and
[1:29:14] written word
[1:29:19] no the word the true Minister
[1:29:23] um
[1:29:26] you are not going to come
[1:29:28] and and play games for the people
[1:29:33] you are not going to be an inspirational
[1:29:36] speaker
[1:29:38] [Music]
[1:29:42] inspirational speakers
[1:29:52] yes but that's one of them who else
[1:29:55] yes that's another one what about in
[1:29:58] Uganda I don't know anyone in Uganda
[1:30:01] you're speaking not on the microphone
[1:30:03] brother don't bring us trouble listen
[1:30:06] these many of these are inspirational
[1:30:09] speakers
[1:30:25] a true ministry
[1:30:27] will be in the power of the spirit
[1:30:33] demonstrating the spoken and written
[1:30:36] word
[1:30:40] that's why even that preacher so
[1:30:42] whatever nobody saw you oh Hallelujah
[1:30:45] when he begins to preach let me tell you
[1:30:49] at any preacher talk about any preacher
[1:30:52] if it's called of God
[1:30:56] rather if he's anointed of God
[1:31:00] he will not preach
[1:31:03] to make people love him
[1:31:07] he will not preach to make brothers
[1:31:13] he will not preach to make you just be
[1:31:16] happy
[1:31:18] but when he preaches he will have one
[1:31:22] purpose

[1:35:36] but where you go again and you feel so
[1:35:40] comfortable even when you were a sinner
[1:35:44] then you should run for your life
[1:35:49] you know but the Bible says we are the

[1:37:17] for determined not to know anything
[1:37:19] among you know
[1:37:22] Jesus Christ
[1:37:45] but he's preaching Community speaking he
[1:37:50] says it was in demonstration
[1:37:54] of the spirit

[1:38:15] Hallelujah it doesn't matter whether you
[1:38:18] preach for one day or 20 20 years
[1:38:29] there will be the demonstration of the
[1:38:31] spirit of God and the power of God
[1:38:37] I remember there is one day in Ethiopia
[1:38:39] we asked by the mortgage to preach for
[1:38:41] the first time
[1:38:45] it was about the second or third time
[1:38:49] and as he was preaching he had his
[1:38:52] sister
[1:38:54] and his sister
[1:38:58] and
[1:39:58] to them foreign
[1:40:52] foreign
[1:41:08] [Music]
[1:41:27] what is that is the power and
[1:41:29] demonstration of the spirit
[1:41:31] is sick
[1:41:33] it's not just going in the church
[1:41:36] and then you see it
[1:41:39] and the word is preached
[1:41:42] and and then you just hear
[1:41:46] others are even on WhatsApp
[1:41:49] you know you're WhatsApp what's up
[1:41:51] what's the demonstration of the spirit
[1:41:53] wow
[1:41:55] foreign
[1:42:01] you can't try to use your WhatsApp
[1:42:05] the power of God will shake it
[1:42:09] let me tell you you come you go it might
[1:42:12] not be discharged
[1:42:14] might be in a fellowship as long as the
[1:42:17] message is being preached in power and
[1:42:18] demonstrations
[1:42:54] his name is
[1:43:05] anointed who was a true Minister
[1:43:08] and he was speaking on the pulpit yeah
[1:43:15] he said tell me brother in you is this
[1:43:19] what you have sold
[1:43:23] he said yes
[1:43:25] he said all right you have not lied to
[1:43:27] me
[1:43:30] immediately
[1:43:35] his wife came here was the power of God
[1:43:40] it's not the place the anointed
[1:43:45] under the power and demonstration of the
[1:43:48] Holy ghosts
[1:43:50] praise the name of the Lord and at that
[1:43:53] moment the sister also came here and at
[1:43:57] that moment
[1:44:15] she died
[1:44:18] that's not that God is alive by the way
[1:44:24] if what we are preaching is the truth
[1:44:27] there must be demonstrations
[1:44:34] there should be Miracles
[1:44:37] if any Ministry I don't care it might be
[1:44:39] this one or anyone oh where is
[1:44:42] a true Ministry
[1:44:45] we must have that part also buddy
[1:44:50] demonstration and power of the Holy
[1:44:53] ghosts
[1:44:55] if it does not have it it is a false
[1:44:59] Ministry
[1:45:04] foreign
[1:45:53] let us leave that for the denominations
[1:46:00] and the denominations where we came from
[1:46:03] just preaching um
[1:46:05] show Faith
[1:46:08] grown in the spirit seeing the more you
[1:46:11] build yourself where were you let the
[1:46:13] word come through you okay
[1:46:19] don't throw it away and be a conductor
[1:46:23] let the Holy Ghost
[1:46:26] you know when you're looking at the
[1:46:28] preacher
[1:46:29] with faith
[1:46:32] close your eyes
[1:46:43] that's not right
[1:46:46] and while Paul was preaching
[1:46:50] as he was preaching
[1:46:53] foreign
[1:47:23] [Music]
[1:47:44] foreign
[1:48:54] foreign
[1:49:35] [Music]
[1:49:55] because
[1:50:05] in the message
[1:50:09] we yield to the Holy Spirit
[1:50:13] and then when he comes the pressure
[1:50:16] begins to preach in the denominations
[1:50:26] today our reading is
[1:50:41] he will go and see it the priest will
[1:50:44] also come on
[1:50:48] so today oh
[1:50:51] we are talking about the power Above the
[1:50:52] Rest
[1:50:56] and you can even hear something falling
[1:50:58] down
[1:51:02] that's not true
[1:51:04] even if it's a coin um
[1:51:13] because there is silence
[1:51:17] the place is so dead
[1:51:22] okay
[1:52:13] it gives you life
[1:52:16] that's why we should always stay under
[1:52:18] the word by the way
[1:52:23] and there's there's another story which
[1:52:24] I wanted to say but I think I should
[1:52:25] skip that you know the one of when Paul
[1:52:27] was preaching and then he preached for
[1:52:30] so long and then a man Fellowship is
[1:52:41] and they brought this younger man
[1:52:45] and Paul I think his name was
[1:52:52] he went into dozing yes when the
[1:52:56] preaching was going on
[1:52:58] and he fell off he was on the window he
[1:53:01] fell off yeah
[1:53:58] [Applause]
[1:54:04] what happened there
[1:54:12] we need to blush shoulders
[1:54:23] with your friends out in the world
[1:54:32] but if you brush shoulders with the
[1:54:35] anointed ones from the house of God
[1:54:42] hallelujah amen their life will come in
[1:54:45] here
[1:54:47] you go there in your friends because
[1:54:50] you're always
[1:54:54] [Music]
[1:55:06] football playing football is not a scene
[1:55:10] or no but there are many things
[1:55:13] associated with it
[1:55:17] the younger people should try to run
[1:55:19] away from
[1:55:22] the address in the shorts back in
[1:55:24] November
[1:55:25] said that is the woman is in a clause
[1:55:36] then the other thing they go there with
[1:55:39] these young people
[1:55:41] some of them are drunk
[1:55:44] others
[1:55:47] [Applause]
[1:55:49] I don't know how they call those people
[1:55:52] you know there is one who keeps the god
[1:55:53] that is
[1:55:54] the one which does in the number what
[1:55:57] number this Defender so man I don't know
[1:56:00] who you're going to be there
[1:56:02] but the one you are always going to be
[1:56:04] with
[1:56:05] his life
[1:56:07] slowly but it doesn't happen immediately
[1:56:11] slowly
[1:56:12] his life
[1:56:19] what happened
[1:56:23] she was not football
[1:56:25] but the issue was who were you playing
[1:56:28] with
[1:56:29] which company were you keeping
[1:56:32] that's why many of us
[1:56:34] decided to run away from that kind of
[1:56:36] life
[1:56:39] we did not we decided to leave the going
[1:56:42] to uh
[1:56:46] yes you know does it what are they
[1:56:49] called in English
[1:56:53] that's why I believe I want to go to
[1:56:55] cinema
[1:56:57] don't go to betting houses
[1:57:00] we don't go to bars
[1:57:08] we don't go to bars we don't we don't go
[1:57:12] to football together we don't want to go
[1:57:15] yeah
[1:57:17] you are getting the spirit of the world
[1:57:21] and you're pretending that you're a
[1:57:23] believer
[1:57:48] hallelujah amen and then all of a sudden
[1:57:50] they will tell you let us go our
[1:57:53] Defenders
[1:58:01] even there's a brother who told me
[1:58:03] I think it was brother even whoever he
[1:58:06] used to love football
[1:58:09] just to go and watch with his friends
[1:58:39] and he realized he was born
[1:58:43] dude
[1:58:49] foreign
[1:59:16] foreign
[1:59:21] but
[1:59:24] Apostle Paul said
[1:59:25] everything is not that that everything
[1:59:30] is lawful
[1:59:32] everything is lawful but not everything
[1:59:34] is expedient
[1:59:38] everything is okay
[1:59:40] but everything is not a must for me to
[1:59:42] do it
[1:59:44] take it
[1:59:46] there's someone who asked me said pastor
[1:59:49] is it is it a sin to drink alcohol
[1:59:53] because even the Bible where it says
[1:59:55] they should not drink much wine
[2:00:00] and then portal Timothy you can take a
[2:00:03] little for your stomach
[2:00:07] so is it okay
[2:00:11] many things are not a sin maybe
[2:00:14] many things we don't do them I mean to
[2:00:16] be injected to be cooler because the
[2:00:18] spirit of God has led us that way
[2:00:23] but I can tell you drunkards have their
[2:00:26] part in Hell Fire
[2:00:30] um
[2:00:33] again
[2:00:36] I can drink but I'm not a bit drunk
[2:00:40] you're playing with a snack
[2:00:44] sadly he had the evident fruit of his
[2:00:48] god-given ministry
[2:00:57] that's the third thing to prove a true
[2:00:58] Ministry
[2:01:01] first thing true to the word of God
[2:01:06] demonstration of the spoken word and the
[2:01:08] written ones
[2:01:17] not might be must be taken Dua
[2:01:21] we should always expect miracles
[2:01:25] whenever we come to church sister if you
[2:01:28] have a problem whenever you come to
[2:01:29] church expect a miracles
[2:01:35] Hallelujah
[2:01:37] and then sadly
[2:01:40] there will be the evident fruit of his
[2:01:42] ministry
[2:01:48] if you are going to preach on the road
[2:01:52] and you are saying telling us that God
[2:01:54] has called you to preach
[2:01:56] but you preached there for two years
[2:01:59] but not even a cockroach
[2:02:06] and see whether God called
[2:02:11] if I say that God sent me tonight
[2:02:14] and there is just two people
[2:02:17] a year after year after year
[2:02:20] then I should really check and see
[2:02:23] whether God called
[2:02:25] that's why I Believe
[2:02:28] by the end of this year this place will
[2:02:32] not be able to carry US foreign
[2:02:45] foreign
