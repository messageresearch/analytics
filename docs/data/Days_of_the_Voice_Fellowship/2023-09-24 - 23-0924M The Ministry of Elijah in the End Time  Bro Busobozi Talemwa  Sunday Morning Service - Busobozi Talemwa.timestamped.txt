[59:22] write down a few scriptures or a few
[59:24] ideas or whatever that the whole spirit
[59:26] will inspire you to receive
[59:35] he was speaking to us on Friday on the
[59:38] power of the importance of inspiration
[59:46] the Holy Spirit inspires me um
[59:52] I'm speaking I'm going to speak to you
[59:54] by inspiration
[59:57] but you also Must Be Inspired
[1:00:01] while you are receiving it
[1:00:03] they don't just receive it when you are
[1:00:06] dormant
[1:00:08] receive it when you are when you are
[1:00:12] active
[1:00:14] if I bring if the Holy Spirit brings it
[1:00:17] through me brings it through me on fire
[1:00:25] that is how it ought to be
[1:00:27] praise the Lord
[1:00:29] so now we are dealing with the spirit of
[1:00:33] Elijah but today I just want to give
[1:00:35] more of the service today is really the
[1:00:36] background
[1:00:42] so whatever God knew that the human race
[1:00:46] will need he has blessed it in the Bible
[1:00:53] there is no new thing under the Earth
[1:00:56] everything that is has been your name is
[1:01:00] everything that shall be is already is
[1:01:05] so what is the work of the Bible
[1:01:09] the work of the Bible is to show us
[1:01:13] things which were
[1:01:16] things which are interested and things
[1:01:20] that is why if you do not read the Bible
[1:01:25] people you are in a lot of danger
[1:01:27] if you don't understand scriptures
[1:01:30] you will not know where you are
[1:01:33] well you know you are in Kampala Uganda
[1:01:37] but you will not know where you are in
[1:01:40] the timeline of God
[1:01:45] so you don't even know where you are in
[1:01:48] your life
[1:01:53] but if you read if you were a Bible
[1:01:56] reader
[1:01:57] Bible you will know everything about
[1:02:00] your life
[1:02:02] you will know where you have been a joke
[1:02:06] you know where you are and you will know
[1:02:09] where you are going
[1:02:10] there is nothing going to take you by
[1:02:12] surprise
[1:02:14] praise the Lord everything is going to
[1:02:18] be accounted foreign
[1:02:46] [Music]
[1:02:49] if you can give me a little more sound
[1:02:51] so then these um these people as they
[1:02:54] were preaching to them
[1:02:58] a little child one woman almost like
[1:03:01] Elijah here today and you know he came
[1:03:05] and asked this man
[1:03:08] I have one question for you
[1:03:11] they said which generation are we in
[1:03:21] he said we are in the
[1:03:23] invention of his excellence
[1:03:28] wow the child looked at the man um
[1:03:34] of about seven years
[1:03:38] TV
[1:03:49] but a little child
[1:03:51] looked at him with those eyes then that
[1:03:55] means you have nothing to say to me
[1:03:59] about the Bible
[1:04:01] the little child knew more than the
[1:04:04] preachers
[1:04:10] if you don't read the Bible you will not
[1:04:12] know
[1:04:14] you will think that is
[1:05:23] to you it should be
[1:06:07] [Music]
[1:06:23] shall be manifest
[1:06:28] [Music]
[1:06:39] they are going to receive them with
[1:06:41] miracles signs and wonders
[1:06:56] and God has promised that there will be
[1:07:00] an Elijah
[1:07:02] Minnesota
[1:07:11] which will restore everything
[1:07:14] but he also says the minister of Elijah
[1:07:18] will be the ministry of the seventh
[1:07:20] Angels
[1:07:22] praise the name of the Lord
[1:07:25] foreign
[1:08:02] right from the days of the Apostles
[1:08:08] you know I realize the message is quite
[1:08:10] a lot of information
[1:08:16] but we in this church
[1:08:19] we concentrate on the life of the
[1:08:22] message
[1:08:23] more than the information
[1:08:26] just to put the whole you know some
[1:08:30] flesh on what we believe
[1:08:34] praise the name of the Lord so now I
[1:08:38] want you to see
[1:08:40] in the Book of Daniel
[1:08:42] while Daniel was praying then idiot yes
[1:08:45] well Daniel was crying because the Jews
[1:08:49] at that time
[1:08:50] they were in captivity
[1:08:53] and Daniel was bothered
[1:09:33] [Music]
[1:09:44] what would happen for 500 years
[1:09:50] [Music]
[1:09:58] God will show me the future
[1:10:03] even about my own life
[1:10:06] we think that spirituality is
[1:10:09] just getting excited
[1:10:12] you know you know you know gifts and all
[1:10:15] those things
[1:10:16] but it is
[1:10:24] built upon the foundation of Revelations
[1:10:31] on the foundation of revelation
[1:10:35] God revealed to uh
[1:10:38] what would happen
[1:10:40] almost 500 years
[1:10:52] then I don't want to spend time with the
[1:10:54] weeks of the of the Jews
[1:10:57] the Jews
[1:11:03] God deals with them as a nation
[1:11:08] as a nation
[1:11:11] in the Bible here one of my Bible we
[1:11:13] even have a number of the Jews who are
[1:11:15] going to be safe
[1:11:18] does anybody know it is
[1:11:23] foreign
[1:12:06] foreign
[1:12:45] yes Elijah area that is the last
[1:12:49] Ministry of Elijah in the Empire where
[1:12:52] is
[1:12:53] that is not for the Gentiles
[1:12:57] for the Jews but for us we are Gentiles
[1:13:01] we must also have our own Elijah
[1:13:04] Ministries
[1:13:07] by Grace
[1:13:09] but by Design
[1:13:12] God Purpose
[1:13:15] ministry will go to the Jews
[1:13:29] one week is how many years
[1:13:34] seven years
[1:13:35] so the Jews traveled one last half are
[1:13:40] you there
[1:13:42] one first half rather
[1:13:44] of the last week when Jesus died
[1:13:48] yesterday when the Messiah was cut off
[1:13:52] from that time from City the time of the
[1:13:55] Jews were supposed
[1:13:59] God is no longer working with the Jews
[1:14:05] right now we're talking if you read your
[1:14:07] Bible The Book of Romans
[1:14:11] the Bible says the Jews they are blinded
[1:14:16] so they can't see
[1:14:19] they have eyes
[1:14:26] because God has blinded them
[1:14:30] why why because they rejected the
[1:14:32] Messiah
[1:14:34] Messiah and why did God blind them
[1:14:37] because he had another group of people
[1:14:44] who are they that is the Gentile price
[1:14:52] and I am one of them this morning
[1:14:57] that is why we are excited about this
[1:15:01] Jesus creation because the Jews

[1:16:54] note Brethren that here should be
[1:16:57] ignorant of this mystery lest here

[1:17:05] Israel until the fullness of the
[1:17:08] Gentiles become in

[1:17:13] praise the name of the Lord oh my
[1:17:16] appreciation like I feel like preaching

[1:17:27] don't take

[1:17:40] a heart
[1:17:43] I don't know how to say that for sure
[1:17:44] but listen he says if you you the
[1:17:48] Gentiles
[1:17:51] you were the Wild Olive Tree
[1:17:55] um
[1:18:01] where they one that was supposed to be
[1:18:05] the original price

[1:18:52] and he brought it onto the Olive Tree
[1:18:57] what is the Olive Tree the olive trees
[1:19:01] Jesus himself
[1:19:03] the Jews
[1:19:12] if he was not able
[1:19:15] foreign
[1:19:43] [Music]
[1:19:44] the original
[1:20:30] [Music]
[1:20:44] but if you read revelation
[1:20:59] what is the fullness of the Gentiles
[1:21:05] the fullness of the Gentiles is
[1:21:10] spoken in Generations
[1:21:13] in a period of Ages
[1:21:17] when did it started when God called
[1:21:21] Soul captain
[1:21:25] and he told him I'm commissioning
[1:21:28] to preach my message
[1:21:32] and Paul became the Apostle to the
[1:21:34] Gentiles
[1:21:38] amen started going all over the world
[1:21:42] most of the New Testament piercing is
[1:21:46] written by Apostle Paul yeah
[1:22:20] [Music]
[1:22:25] I mean
[1:22:26] yes I'm giving you a lot of information
[1:22:28] this morning
[1:22:30] so I wanted to put on your spiritual
[1:22:32] thinking
[1:22:34] [Music]
[1:22:34] okay
[1:22:38] if you close your eyes you will miss
[1:22:41] I've met a few Jews
[1:22:49] some of them are even artists the gender
[1:22:52] dispensation is over and the gentle
[1:22:55] dispensation is over
[1:22:57] um
[1:22:58] you brothers and sisters
[1:23:05] go out and tell others
[1:23:08] time is
[1:23:11] soon and very soon Jesus is going back
[1:23:15] to the Jews
[1:23:17] will be left with their denominations
[1:23:22] but out of the Gentiles
[1:23:25] Jesus
[1:23:29] Jesus has a purpose yes
[1:23:34] out of the gentle church
[1:23:38] not everyone Among The Gents foreign
[1:24:35] you know he was the only one that did
[1:24:38] not die
[1:24:40] by being murdered
[1:24:44] all the others they killed them
[1:24:48] they caught him to kill him
[1:24:49] they couldn't catch him
[1:24:52] one time when they caught him he said
[1:24:55] this guy is very sneaky
[1:24:58] let us boil him
[1:25:02] so that we can be sure he's dead
[1:25:07] they fired up a drum of oil yeah
[1:25:17] and they want to sleep
[1:25:19] of course he's dead
[1:25:23] in the morning they found the guy there
[1:25:28] [Music]
[1:25:32] said this guy he said he's a witch
[1:25:45] we
[1:25:47] are going to banish him
[1:25:54] and they threw him to an island
[1:26:00] and when you read in the Book of
[1:26:02] Revelation
[1:26:04] one of the first words
[1:26:08] I wanted to see what it says
[1:26:12] praise the Lord
[1:26:16] he says
[1:26:18] I John is
[1:26:23] who also am your brother
[1:26:28] and companion in Tribulation
[1:26:32] and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus
[1:26:36] Christ
[1:26:43] for the word of God and for the
[1:26:45] testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:26:49] and he says I was in the spirit
[1:26:55] so some of us people who believe that
[1:26:57] the Lord this day is this
[1:27:02] yes it used to be
[1:27:05] before Jesus Christ
[1:27:07] but after Jesus Christ
[1:27:13] Jesus said I am the lord of the cies
[1:27:17] [Music]
[1:27:28] Legend I will give you rest
[1:27:32] for your soul
[1:27:34] meaning he said I will give you some
[1:27:37] beauty
[1:27:40] cease to just be a time period of 24
[1:27:43] hours 12 hours
[1:27:48] it is now given
[1:27:51] by the lord of the Sabbath
[1:27:56] foreign
[1:28:09] [Music]
[1:28:22] foreign
[1:28:50] [Music]
[1:29:00] [Music]
[1:29:42] foreign
[1:30:04] those are the works we rest forever
[1:30:07] when we are in our Sabbath
[1:30:10] oh praise the name of the Lord praise
[1:30:13] the name of the Lord
[1:30:15] so John was taken to the island
[1:30:22] he began to see Vision
[1:30:24] his submission Vision after vision
[1:30:30] of the whole future
[1:30:35] he saw about Israel he saw about the
[1:30:38] gentle church
[1:30:44] it's about everything and when it comes
[1:30:47] to the gentle Church
[1:30:51] seven golden candlesticks
[1:30:56] are you hearing me
[1:30:59] and there was one
[1:31:01] in the middle of the candlestics
[1:31:19] not to reveal
[1:31:21] Ed
[1:31:23] so it is still sealed
[1:31:28] Elijah's Ministers
[1:31:41] of the seven churches
[1:31:44] to the Gentiles
[1:31:48] foreign
[1:31:53] [Music]
[1:32:56] [Music]
[1:33:07] how many Churches of Christ do we have
[1:33:10] to remember
[1:33:15] foreign
[1:33:21] [Music]
[1:33:47] but now negative it is one Church while
[1:33:51] the seven churches now you actually
[1:33:53] mechanisms
[1:33:55] are just generation
[1:34:00] of the same church Ghana mechanism
[1:34:03] [Music]
[1:34:07] the first one was
[1:34:11] it yeah
[1:34:20] The Messengers
[1:34:23] [Music]
[1:34:27] and those people to be prepared for the
[1:34:30] Rapture
[1:34:32] they had to believe the message of their
[1:34:35] Messengers
[1:34:45] that is true
[1:34:47] they believe
[1:34:50] they believe
[1:34:53] Paul
[1:34:55] Paul is the messenger
[1:34:59] foreign
[1:36:05] foreign
[1:36:15] okay if Paul power is the only one but I
[1:36:19] how come we all are going to be judged
[1:36:21] by this is
[1:36:24] our generation we are facing different
[1:36:27] things
[1:36:28] that Paul never even talked about
[1:36:31] Paul never talked about TV
[1:36:34] he never talked about the internet
[1:36:38] God is orderly
[1:36:41] [Music]
[1:37:40] foreign foreign
[1:38:41] foreign
[1:39:34] and they would lay down their very lives
[1:39:38] for the sake of the revelation of the
[1:39:41] message they had received
[1:39:44] I was told that it was not safe Integra
[1:39:48] bank
[1:39:50] but if God has laid on my on my heart
[1:39:53] abandoned to God
[1:39:56] how can I stand between before John
[1:39:59] Wesley
[1:40:01] was about age
[1:40:06] people were moved around some sort of
[1:40:10] Revival Nevada
[1:40:17] foreign
[1:41:23] and that's the age we are living
[1:41:41] when God sends a messenger
[1:41:45] the star to the last age
[1:41:48] there will be no time left
[1:41:52] after his message
[1:42:00] the only thing left
[1:42:03] for God to go back again
[1:42:07] I want to announcement some of you who
[1:42:11] may not have known
[1:42:13] this messenger
[1:42:19] his message has been sounded

[1:45:05] they even helped him
[1:45:07] but how many states
[1:45:11] foreign
[1:45:27] the only thing that makes us different
[1:45:30] is we are standing for truth
[1:45:34] not numbers
[1:45:39] not ideas we are standing for the Holy
[1:45:43] Ghost
[1:45:45] not for money see

[1:46:01] foreign
[1:46:19] [Music]
[1:46:49] there's a big blessing
[1:46:54] and then you see people running
[1:47:00] 20 people 34.
[1:47:02] the man has already made 60 minutes
[1:47:08] and then he begins to bless now
[1:47:10] oh I feel the anointed
[1:47:16] it's not the anointing of God
[1:47:26] if you don't know it and you have never
[1:47:28] had one million in your pockets
[1:47:37] there is this money called geology
[1:47:40] he quickly went there yet he he was he
[1:47:44] has who picked it from the the the the
[1:47:46] the the the man there yes
[1:47:48] yes quickly went and told him because
[1:47:52] you know the man went to bring boat
[1:47:54] money
[1:47:55] to appreciate the man of God because of
[1:47:59] healing him again and the man of God
[1:48:03] Elijah said
[1:48:05] I Don't Preach for money
[1:48:08] I don't want you to appreciate me don't
[1:48:10] see me appreciate God see my cartoon is
[1:48:19] the pastors

[1:49:24] the guy took it in his house
[1:50:28] foreign foreign
[1:50:33] all the days of his life
[1:50:41] it's just praise God
[1:50:44] the guy who was anointed
[1:50:47] even for God
[1:50:49] the power that was in the man
[1:50:54] he forgot the power of the spoken
[1:50:57] nonetheless
[1:50:59] as much as man is that way
[1:51:02] it doesn't mean that we should not
[1:51:04] forgive us
[1:51:06] to the extent that some Believers don't
[1:51:08] even pay their Titans anymore
[1:51:12] and then it is a surprise that you are
[1:51:15] surprised that things are not going well
[1:51:16] for you

[1:51:34] all of it for who for God
[1:51:38] he wants to understand
[1:51:41] you to understand all your blessings
[1:51:52] of all our earnings
[1:51:58] that is the only scripture
[1:52:01] where God says in Malachi 3
[1:52:04] says
[1:52:11] and see if I will not power blessings
[1:52:18] it is
[1:52:20] foreign
[1:52:22] you see I don't play your ties
[1:52:24] everywhere
[1:52:27] nice to your local child
[1:52:32] is not a church near you
[1:52:37] where you feed from yeah
[1:52:40] where there is a pastor that you believe
[1:52:43] is the man of God that God has sent to
[1:52:45] minister to you
[1:52:50] and I don't only want your type
[1:52:53] when I cannot Pastor you
[1:52:56] I must be able to bastard I must be able
[1:53:00] to teach you you must be able to cancel
[1:53:06] because that's the way that God has
[1:53:08] ordained in the world
[1:53:11] don't send me your time
[1:53:14] when you are not coming yeah
[1:53:22] foreign
[1:53:40] [Music]
[1:53:43] so who is he to you
[1:53:46] oh he's a preacher I like
[1:53:49] what if you like him but you don't like
[1:53:52] him enough to be your pastor
[1:53:55] then you can't pay your time
[1:54:00] but if if he is your pastor
[1:54:03] you believe is your past
[1:55:08] and you are suffering you are laboring
[1:55:12] and you are not doing well financially
[1:55:15] don't you worry
[1:55:18] God is responsible for that condition
[1:55:22] so come to him
[1:55:26] he will give you guidance
[1:55:30] there is nothing that goes amiss
[1:55:39] because we we ignore this simple simple
[1:55:43] things
[1:55:45] you find some people suffering
[1:55:47] unnecessary
[1:55:50] yet there is
[1:55:56] foreign
[1:56:36] foreign
[1:57:11] do you realize even in heaven
[1:57:14] they were not actually the same the way
[1:57:16] we think
[1:57:20] we'll see
[1:57:22] this man is because
[1:57:46] is not good
[1:57:48] foreign
[1:58:20] foreign
[1:59:07] okay
[2:00:07] foreign
[2:01:14] what about the Gentiles
[2:01:20] two things happen to them
[2:01:23] who had the messengers message
[2:01:33] those who did not accept it
[2:01:36] they'll remain here
[2:01:42] what will be happening with them
[2:01:45] tribulation today
[2:01:58] with their messages
[2:02:08] [Music]
[2:02:43] that kind of gospel
[2:02:44] prepares them for the tribulation
[2:03:47] I don't know
[2:04:40] [Music]
[2:04:45] during that same time
[2:05:27] will always produce the same results
[2:05:31] some reasons every Bible hear him and
[2:05:33] those Jews already I have may not all of
[2:05:36] them will be saved
[2:05:38] but there will also be an elect
[2:05:42] among them and they will have a number
[2:05:45] 144
[2:05:47] 000. um
[2:05:57] then the Bible says
[2:06:09] you know people have been talking about
[2:06:11] it
[2:06:13] and the Biden has been talking about it
[2:06:17] but let me tell you it is not coming
[2:06:20] when I am still yes
[2:06:31] foreign
[2:06:57] foreign
[2:07:25] on a white horse
[2:07:27] and the Bible says
[2:07:31] they took all their weapons
[2:07:37] but the Bible says
[2:07:42] and destroyed all of them
[2:07:45] Jesus Christ himself
[2:07:58] because when it comes down
[2:08:04] he comes to change the world
[2:08:07] he come to bring a new civilization
[2:08:11] he comes down
[2:08:18] hallelujah amen the Bible says
[2:08:22] the kingdoms of the world
[2:08:25] will become the kingdom
[2:08:29] Jesus Christ
[2:08:36] in the city
[2:08:39] where will the bride be oh my God we
[2:08:42] shall come with him
[2:08:46] for a space of one thousands
[2:08:51] Jesus yes we'll take the Throne of David
[2:08:55] to fulfill the scripture that is
[2:09:03] of Jesus
[2:09:06] he will reign
[2:09:09] and the bride by his sons
[2:09:27] [Applause]
[2:09:32] because we oh my goodness we have been
[2:09:36] already exonerated
[2:09:58] from that moment from that moment
[2:10:08] there we shall judge with him
[2:10:15] don't worry if you think these are
[2:10:16] stories
[2:10:23] it's what the Bible says
[2:10:25] these are prophecies
[2:10:33] but I'm preaching for two reasons so
[2:10:37] that you can rejoice and prepare well
[2:10:40] for that
[2:10:41] number two if you are going to remain
[2:10:43] here
[2:10:48] when you're suffering you know for how
[2:10:50] long
[2:11:09] this will be
[2:12:09] be on fire
[2:12:10] foreign
[2:12:25] let us read first king 17.7
[2:12:30] and the word of the Lord came unto me
