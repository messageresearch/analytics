[34:56] why the bush is not back
[34:59] and when the lord

[39:07] tell you that
[39:09] though the situation you may look you

[39:14] opposite what the promise says that god
[39:17] is faithful amen
[39:20] amen he will make a word for you
[39:23] hallelujah we have just read
[39:25] from the book of exodus amen my sermon
[39:29] today is entitled
[39:32] god has not delayed
[39:36] and god has not denied
[39:39] but what are you doing
[39:41] amen
[39:43] god
[39:44] has not denied that's why
[39:47] and god has not denied
[39:51] but brother sam what are you doing
[40:02] amen
[40:04] you know as children of god
[40:06] there are very many times we we we live
[40:09] this journey of life and that
[40:11] and many times we we think that
[40:14] god has blamed to do
[40:17] what he promised to do
[40:19] god has delayed to do to answer our
[40:22] prayers
[40:24] and uh and uh and usually when we see
[40:26] brother shame please help me do me a
[40:28] favor yes you understand and uh and
[40:31] usually when we think that god has
[40:34] delayed
[40:36] it takes us to a moment
[40:38] where we think that god has
[40:41] denied
[40:43] amen
[40:44] we think that god has denied
[40:47] now the sermon is
[40:49] god has not delayed
[40:52] god has not denied
[40:55] but my brother my sister
[40:58] church of god the bride of christ what
[41:01] are you doing
[41:04] right if you think he has the name what
[41:07] are you doing about it
[41:09] these things he has denied what are you
[41:12] doing about it
[41:16] we have just read from them from one of
[41:18] the most important verses
[41:20] in the in the life of israel
[41:23] the journey when god was taking his
[41:26] children from a from from from a land of
[41:30] bondage
[41:31] god was taking his children from a land
[41:35] where he took them himself
[41:38] guru was was talking to people that he
[41:43] had promises that he had made himself
[41:46] oh let me tell you none of the children
[41:49] of israel who were in bondage
[41:52] was
[41:53] let me let me bring it this way
[41:55] no one of the people who were in egypt
[41:59] had anything to do with what white they
[42:01] were there
[42:04] oh let me rephrase it right
[42:06] so that you may get it
[42:09] we believe there was more than two
[42:11] million people
[42:12] but none of them
[42:15] was was even aware or concerned or
[42:18] most of them did not even it was not
[42:21] because of them that they were in the
[42:24] land of captivity
[42:25] it was not their own making
[42:28] it was not
[42:30] this was god is making
[42:33] these men just found themselves in
[42:35] prison
[42:37] these men just found themselves starving
[42:39] past masters
[42:42] they found themselves in the world they
[42:44] didn't ask themselves to be there
[42:47] if it is not the truth are we not
[42:49] exactly the same type
[42:52] we just found ourselves here
[42:54] we found our mothers
[42:56] we just woke up one day and we started
[42:58] seeing daddy and we just started seeing
[43:00] mommy and we just found ourselves in
[43:02] this world
[43:04] we didn't know where we came from
[43:06] we didn't know what what we are doing
[43:08] here
[43:10] but
[43:11] that doesn't mean
[43:13] that whatsoever we were bumped into
[43:16] whatsoever we were caught into it was
[43:18] started by somebody
[43:21] the bible says in the book of
[43:23] philippians chapter 1 and verses 6 when
[43:26] you shall not read that it says that he
[43:29] who began a good work in us that's right
[43:33] he is faithful that he will bring you to
[43:35] accomplishment but now this is where the
[43:37] question comes
[43:39] do you know
[43:40] that the mess you are in
[43:42] the egypt you are in the life you're in
[43:46] somebody had to start that journey do
[43:48] you even know it
[43:54] we are looking at the people who fold
[43:56] themselves in this kind of life
[43:59] but i want to thank god and minister
[44:02] what these people were going through
[44:04] god because it was his plan because it
[44:07] was his will because it was his promise
[44:10] he had prepared a messenger
[44:14] amen he had prepared somebody to come to
[44:18] the sea and let these people know what
[44:21] is going on
[44:22] amen that's right that's right
[44:25] he had prepared a messenger
[44:27] who was to come with a message to let
[44:30] these people know what is going on
[44:34] yes why all the hard work
[44:37] why would the heartache
[44:38] why are they the weeps
[44:42] and i want to tell you my brother my
[44:44] sister this is evil
[44:45] right we are also coaching this mess
[44:49] the lord prepared a messenger and a
[44:52] message for you
[44:53] for this hour amen amen
[44:57] my brother my sister we have a messenger
[45:01] that was ordained specifically
[45:04] to pick a people out of islam to another
[45:08] man
[45:11] he was ordained before the foundation of
[45:14] the world
[45:15] he was purposed
[45:17] and his work was nothing but it would go
[45:21] and pick these people yes from the land
[45:25] where they didn't know about how they
[45:27] went amen
[45:31] that is why my brother my sister was
[45:33] listening to me
[45:37] as long as you don't realize
[45:41] who began a work in you
[45:45] as long as you don't realize the plan he
[45:48] has for you you will always say that he
[45:51] has delayed that's right you will not
[45:53] only say that he has denied yes
[45:58] one day we were praying somewhere and
[45:59] then somebody was asking
[46:01] god
[46:02] that has not answered me and then he was
[46:05] did he give you a timetable did you give
[46:07] me a debt
[46:08] and the time and the hour the week when
[46:10] he will answer
[46:13] have you waited enough
[46:15] like ibrahim
[46:18] have you written enough
[46:22] like moses how many years
[46:25] 40 years
[46:29] why are you saying goodness delayed
[46:32] why are you saying good as me
[46:38] we have
[46:39] a messenger in this hour we have a
[46:43] message my brother
[46:46] and the root
[46:48] and the way
[46:50] and the journey
[46:52] it is all within this ordained messenger
[46:56] that is why my brother my sister you
[46:59] must know your messenger and you must
[47:02] know his message
[47:04] all right that's right
[47:08] probably in egypt those men they were
[47:10] there some of them when moses had come
[47:13] they remembering their feelings
[47:15] as long as they didn't know that the
[47:18] messenger has come they remain crying
[47:21] let me tell you something about know me
[47:25] the bible talks about a man called jacob
[47:28] this jacob had a son he loved so much
[47:31] that the son was called joseph
[47:35] and then very many things happened as
[47:37] you know and he thought
[47:40] his son was
[47:41] dead
[47:42] do you know how many years
[47:46] jacob spent crying
[47:48] weeping
[47:50] in agony for a son a beloved that he
[47:54] thought was dead
[47:56] but let me ask you
[47:57] was the son dead
[48:02] now what was the agony about
[48:05] my sister what is the tears about
[48:10] joseph was not dead
[48:12] i don't know i didn't get time to
[48:13] cultivate how many years did it take
[48:16] but the bible says this man loved him
[48:19] here
[48:24] the bible says those who know their god
[48:27] i want that word in you
[48:31] do you know
[48:32] what heaven is doing in this hour
[48:38] we are in a time
[48:40] which is a very very important time
[48:44] as a ministry and as the bride of christ
[48:49] here as a ministry
[48:51] we are in a time
[48:53] where we are believing we are stepping
[48:55] into the water to start the construction
[48:59] of
[49:00] days of the voice cabana
[49:03] is it true
[49:07] but let me tell you something
[49:09] as we are planning to construct
[49:12] a physical building
[49:14] let me tell you the secret god is also
[49:16] planning actually he's not planning he
[49:19] already started planning to build a
[49:22] spiritual building
[49:26] as we are going together to do this
[49:29] to construct god also wants to construct
[49:32] us
[49:36] by the time this message came to the
[49:38] israelites time was no more
[49:45] we are into building but even god is
[49:49] into building us
[49:53] god is into building our lives

[50:19] are in what we call the third
[50:22] episode

[50:28] i'm saying that the word exodus means
[50:32] cold

[50:37] somewhere and go somewhere
[50:42] we are not established people
[50:45] we are not just a people we are not
[50:47] pastors we are not just another church

[51:40] hour
[51:41] what are you doing about the prophecy of
[51:44] the hour
[51:46] what are you doing about the journey
[51:49] that we started when we came to this
[51:51] message what are you doing
[51:53] i'm just grumbling
[51:55] are you guessing my money

[52:06] uh
[52:07] 6306 30.
[52:09] we're going to read from paragraph
[52:12] 62
[52:14] and down through
[52:17] amen my brother
[52:22] this is coming
[52:25] yeah it is uh

[52:29] 0 6
[52:30] 30 paragraph
[52:33] 62
[52:35] yeah

[52:39] shall go down up to paragraph
[52:42] 68
[52:45] oh no i didn't i just
[52:47] i just wrote the title here then maybe
[52:49] you can look for the word green
[52:54] amen
[52:55] the third exodus
[52:58] amen
[53:00] thank you very much
[53:02] okay
[53:04] yes paragraph let's go to 62. let's
[53:07] follow closely and see what
[53:10] the prophet was saying
[53:12] before yes before
[53:20] yes please excuse us a little bit
[53:23] before we can find out
[53:26] what this exodus mean and i am going to
[53:29] type the exodus now
[53:31] to exodus then okay so he was talking
[53:34] about the eggs that we are in now
[53:38] and he's going to type into the exodus
[53:40] then
[53:42] now and watch
[53:44] if it isn't run exactly parallel so
[53:47] we're saying we are going to type our
[53:49] exodus today and the other one and see
[53:52] whether things are not running parallel
[53:57] one of them is natural
[54:00] and the very same things that he did in
[54:02] the nature he's typing it again and
[54:05] typing it in
[54:08] now this one is said that what happened
[54:10] in the natural exodus
[54:13] when god was physically taking his
[54:16] children out of this land of captivity
[54:18] out of this land of bondage a landlord
[54:21] crime a land of groaning a land of
[54:24] confusion
[54:26] brothers and sisters
[54:28] is it not the type of this exodus we are
[54:30] in right that's right we're now in a
[54:33] land of questions a land of hard work
[54:36] the land
[54:47] meaning it is getting fulfilled now
[54:50] exactly exactly as it was
[54:54] that is why church of god we need to
[54:56] know what exactly is going on
[55:01] so that we don't just chase the wind
[55:04] now motherless to see the word of god
[55:08] how anyone could say it's not his fire
[55:11] this was about 2800 years ago you know
[55:15] and now that he promised and what he's
[55:18] done and laid it out there for example
[55:21] how he makes the shadow of something to
[55:24] testify of the positive so still giving
[55:26] the time
[55:28] i get to uh
[55:29] i get to that tonight between the moon
[55:32] and the sun the lord willing amen but
[55:35] let's go to this part but first
[55:38] we must review genesis to see why they
[55:42] were down in egypt
[55:45] now let's give it some time i love this
[55:48] part he said
[55:50] and i was introducing i said these
[55:52] people found themselves
[55:55] in a place
[55:57] they didn't know about how they came
[55:59] we are still reading that quote they
[56:01] didn't know but not brother branham he
[56:04] wants to take us back
[56:13] my brother my sister do you know that
[56:15] where you are
[56:18] there was a time you made a choice to be
[56:21] there
[56:22] knowingly or knowing
[56:24] whether it was you or you just fooled
[56:26] yourself
[56:27] do you know
[56:28] it and that's right
[56:35] you see
[56:36] many times
[56:38] as we are writing this many times this
[56:41] in this world we ask ourselves this
[56:42] question why
[56:44] why
[56:45] why
[56:46] you know why people ask themselves that
[56:48] question why it is because
[56:51] down deep inside their hearts something
[56:53] tells them
[56:55] you're not supposed to be
[56:56] here something just brought you here
[57:03] the one preacher said why not
[57:07] but the reason as to why there is always
[57:09] that question in our hearts why why it
[57:12] is because by the time you say why
[57:15] you're not supposed to be there
[57:17] amen
[57:20] i'll go to genesis they were down in
[57:22] need
[57:22] why would goddess people be out of that
[57:25] land
[57:28] why
[57:29] why are goddess people out of that land
[57:33] after all god promised that
[57:36] right there where the beginning was with
[57:38] abraham isaac and jacob in the palestine
[57:42] god gave them that land
[57:44] god had given his people their
[57:47] land
[57:49] god had blessed his people
[57:51] good as continuing people
[57:56] why are we crying here at night
[57:59] why are these things happening to us
[58:04] why are we not in canon felons
[58:08] why are we living below our privileges
[58:10] as children of god
[58:13] why have we reached to a moment where we
[58:16] think god has delayed that yesterday
[58:19] why
[58:20] then after asking you why
[58:22] my question to this from the lord is
[58:25] what are you doing about it
[58:30] god gave them that land
[58:34] this is it oh that
[58:36] why would the people not be in the place
[58:38] that god provided them now let me ask
[58:41] you children of god please leave it
[58:43] are you sure you're aware where god
[58:44] wants you
[58:47] somebody answered me
[58:48] are you really sure convinced in your
[58:51] heart that right now you are where god
[58:54] wants you to be
[59:01] all right
[59:03] now if you're there
[59:05] do you know what is going on
[59:09] now these people
[59:11] they didn't know
[59:12] but probably when mothers came and told
[59:15] them then they got the awareness
[59:18] now we have got the awareness
[59:20] by the believing of this message of the
[59:22] hour
[59:23] but now what are we doing about it
[59:29] those days we didn't know why we are
[59:30] here we were just enjoying our lives
[59:33] we're just living the way we want
[59:35] but ever since we received the message
[59:38] ever since we got the call yes that
[59:41] please
[59:56] you know the good thing i love about
[59:58] this message
[59:59] and about this exodus
[1:00:01] it was
[1:00:03] it was
[1:00:05] more concerned about god
[1:00:08] of course these children of israel had a
[1:00:11] law to pray
[1:00:12] but the biggest rule was already played
[1:00:16] let me remind you first when jesus died
[1:00:19] at calvary what did he say he said he is
[1:00:22] finished amen that's right
[1:00:24] let me tell you bragg of christ we are
[1:00:27] just fighting in what we call a cold war
[1:00:30] a battle that was already finished amen
[1:00:34] the moment the prophet moses came in the
[1:00:38] land
[1:00:40] what these people have to do is to
[1:00:42] listen to the messenger amen to listen
[1:00:45] to the message to remain every promise
[1:00:48] amen claim the promises that's right by
[1:00:51] the time the prophet comes everywhere
[1:01:02] what was the children of israel doing
[1:01:05] what were they doing
[1:01:08] do you know what heaven is doing
[1:01:12] do you not a spiritual stand do you know
[1:01:14] the spiritual campus do you know what
[1:01:17] heaven is doing
[1:01:18] now
[1:01:21] that is why you see the message is not a
[1:01:25] bunch of
[1:01:27] rules and regulations those are those it
[1:01:30] is beyond that my sister yes she said
[1:01:32] look at this message is beyond putting
[1:01:35] on the wrong dress it is beyond
[1:01:40] [Music]
[1:01:53] that's the question of today also
[1:01:56] god gave us pentecost
[1:01:58] i'm not talking about this for
[1:02:00] denomination
[1:02:01] god gave us what pentecost
[1:02:04] he gives us the book of acts
[1:02:07] amen now let me tell you do you know
[1:02:09] what the book of acts means
[1:02:11] okay let us just get the word acts
[1:02:15] faster the other day was telling us
[1:02:16] about something that there was a
[1:02:18] preacher was talking to him and said
[1:02:19] that me i am a man who gives action
[1:02:24] let me tell you
[1:02:25] this message this god this messenger
[1:02:29] this journey this exodus it is a journey
[1:02:32] of acts
[1:02:34] it is a journey of actions
[1:02:37] that's right
[1:02:38] amen the president was talking about the
[1:02:40] true identification of the great church
[1:02:42] there must be action right
[1:02:45] brother shame there must be actions
[1:02:48] there must be acts of the holy spirit in
[1:02:51] your life amen amen right amen
[1:02:55] he gave us the book of hearts he gave us
[1:02:57] the holy spirit
[1:02:59] to lead us and guide us
[1:03:01] he give us a land
[1:03:04] a brother my sister do you believe that
[1:03:07] there is a land that he gave us
[1:03:10] do you believe
[1:03:13] and why are we out of it
[1:03:17] i am praying with all my heart
[1:03:20] that the lord may speak to you as we are
[1:03:22] sharing this
[1:03:25] why are you out of it
[1:03:27] why are we not out of pentecost why are
[1:03:30] we out of the book of acts
[1:03:34] why
[1:03:36] why isn't the great christian church
[1:03:39] today living again like the book of acts
[1:03:45] yes
[1:03:46] we have heard messages we are preachers
[1:03:48] i'm saying that the rapture is over new
[1:03:50] time is first spent okay if we think god
[1:03:54] has delayed
[1:03:56] and some other people even some time ago
[1:03:58] they gave up buying that
[1:04:02] if you think god has been ready to come
[1:04:03] and take his church if you think god has
[1:04:06] led to take you into the land where you
[1:04:08] belong what are you doing about it
[1:04:12] sister
[1:04:13] what are you doing about it
[1:04:17] what are you doing about the promise of
[1:04:19] this hour
[1:04:22] what are you doing about the pentecost
[1:04:27] bringing forth the same thing
[1:04:29] there is some reason for it
[1:04:34] amen
[1:04:35] children of god
[1:04:37] that is what we are here for
[1:04:39] we are not just here to pass time
[1:04:43] amen the other time says that when the
[1:04:46] night of passover came
[1:04:49] when the passover night came
[1:04:51] everybody was told to do what
[1:04:55] to get their names
[1:04:56] to eat
[1:04:58] they pass over meat
[1:05:04] brother
[1:05:05] says he was dramatizing it and he said
[1:05:07] that the children were wondering that he
[1:05:09] was eating the meat while peeping in the
[1:05:11] window
[1:05:13] with the stuff
[1:05:20] hey
[1:05:34] why the time had come
[1:05:42] everything you are doing my sister my
[1:05:45] brother
[1:05:47] just know that time is here
[1:05:52] god is just waiting he's just waiting
[1:05:55] for the blind basically the prophet said
[1:05:58] that the wedding garment and all its
[1:06:00] materials are already finished
[1:06:05] but the problem is some of us are still
[1:06:07] very huge
[1:06:09] that we cannot fit in there yet
[1:06:12] let me tell you
[1:06:14] that is why i love this message the
[1:06:16] message tells the symbols using what you
[1:06:18] are saying to me you should never
[1:06:20] promise to marry because children when
[1:06:22] you are not ready
[1:06:24] because once the pride is
[1:06:36] [Music]
[1:06:59] it is a clear sign that you have not yet
[1:07:02] put on the garment yet
[1:07:05] the reason as to why jesus has not yet
[1:07:07] come back yet it is a clear sign
[1:07:11] that some of us have
[1:07:23] yes
[1:07:24] before i married there was a young man
[1:07:26] who told me
[1:07:39] you will want to marry them tomorrow
[1:07:44] the bridegroom is there waiting he just
[1:07:46] wants us to get married
[1:07:49] yes
[1:07:53] as you're working as you planning as
[1:07:55] you're thinking whatever you're doing
[1:07:58] let me tell you i think we are the only
[1:08:00] brand
[1:08:01] who will be allowed
[1:08:03] to be doing some business while we are
[1:08:05] putting on that elf
[1:08:07] see because we are still waiting for
[1:08:09] mother we are waiting for somebody to
[1:08:11] come
[1:08:14] my brother put on your gum
[1:08:16] the exorcist is at home
[1:08:18] go to school with your girl go to them
[1:08:20] and to the garage with your girl
[1:08:28] this is no time for no sense that's
[1:08:31] right amen amen
[1:08:47] there is a reason
[1:08:48] my brother get me isaiah 50 verse 1 and
[1:08:52] 2.
[1:08:56] tell your neighbour
[1:08:57] there is a reason why you are where you
[1:09:00] are that's right
[1:09:02] my family my family at home there is the
[1:09:05] reason why we are aware we are
[1:09:07] brother kevin i'm telling you just
[1:09:12] there is a reason why you are where you
[1:09:14] are
[1:09:16] amen amen
[1:09:19] there is no i.t man or any manufacturer
[1:09:22] who first manufactures
[1:09:24] a speaker
[1:09:26] that's that speaker he manufactures it
[1:09:28] and then he asks what do i need for okay
[1:09:32] now what is the use of these things that
[1:09:33] are i cannot see that kind of
[1:09:35] manufacturer
[1:09:37] who is a manufacturer
[1:09:38] and again called the friends you
[1:09:40] brothers what can we use this guitar for
[1:09:43] that is what you were not good at
[1:09:47] they are asking very silly very useless
[1:09:50] characters
[1:09:54] god you are there was so who has told
[1:09:56] you that he manufactured that editor who
[1:09:58] has said that
[1:09:59] he put that seed in that dark fruit and
[1:10:02] he didn't know that he could have too
[1:10:03] bad
[1:10:08] there is a reason why you are where you
[1:10:10] are
[1:10:12] isaiah 50 verse 1 as i said the lord
[1:10:16] where is the bill of your mother's
[1:10:18] depression
[1:10:21] he was asking these people were
[1:10:23] complaining
[1:10:24] where is the bill of your mother's
[1:10:26] divorcement
[1:10:28] when did i divorce your mother
[1:10:33] who have i put away
[1:10:36] so good question
[1:10:41] we have encountered very many questions
[1:10:42] in the bible where god was asking such
[1:10:44] kind of questions
[1:10:48] in the beginning part of isaiah chapter
[1:10:50] one he was saying that i gave birth
[1:10:53] and i nursed but my children don't know
[1:10:56] so he was asking when did i chase him
[1:10:58] you are saying that i have delayed when
[1:11:00] where where when like where when did the
[1:11:03] guy who told you
[1:11:05] he said that he has denied to answer who
[1:11:07] has told you he was asking them
[1:11:24] can you imagine god was asking this
[1:11:26] question
[1:11:29] amen i think you've got to know behind

[1:19:17] that is the report god brought to his

[1:21:54] he's saying the most terrible condition

[1:22:33] terrible has ever lived is today it is
[1:22:37] the time
[1:22:38] and we are on the right on the brim or
[1:22:41] the blink of a breath now
[1:22:44] why are we in a very terrible condition
[1:22:47] it is because this wide brimmer bring to
[1:22:50] the
[1:22:55] i was preaching to my family at home in
[1:22:57] the altar i told them to really carry
[1:23:00] anywhere we at the age
[1:23:02] any time
[1:23:04] that's right
[1:23:10] the plane takes off from the ground at
[1:23:13] the speed of which is the fastest on the
[1:23:15] ground
[1:23:17] and when it
[1:23:18] is in anything it knocks it down
[1:23:21] so the time of
[1:23:24] swapping up the time it is a very
[1:23:27] time
[1:23:30] it is a time of nonsense
[1:23:47] time
[1:23:53] amen amen
[1:23:56] there is no more joke
[1:23:58] you can't just come to church you know
[1:24:01] it is not a time for people to be
[1:24:02] reminded to come to church that's right
[1:24:04] for people to come to church
[1:24:06] it is not the time to remind people to
[1:24:08] fast and pray it is not that time
[1:24:11] brothers
[1:24:13] it is time to
[1:24:14] gather amen we are the brim of the
[1:24:17] bridge at the edge of a great terrific
[1:24:20] judgment playing for the church
[1:24:27] yoga
[1:24:32] there is a fire that is going to fall on
[1:24:34] this earth
[1:24:35] and you cannot even tell somebody
[1:24:38] passing by that judgment is coming
[1:24:40] brother repent
[1:24:43] and you're complaining that you don't
[1:24:44] have man what is money
[1:24:48] and before this judgment can happen god
[1:24:51] is calling an extraorder
[1:24:53] just like he did then
[1:24:59] come here though
[1:25:01] they went down in egypt
[1:25:03] all because of the jerusalem brother
[1:25:06] that's the reason that israel went in
[1:25:09] egypt
[1:25:10] there is a reason why you know where you
[1:25:11] are
[1:25:15] that is the reason why i don't pray my
[1:25:16] sister
[1:25:18] there is a reason why you're complaining
[1:25:21] and god has sent me to tell you that it
[1:25:23] is not from his side it is
[1:25:28] yes
[1:25:30] god let me tell you
[1:25:32] this when we are traveling let me tell
[1:25:34] you
[1:25:36] some of the things i am thinking about
[1:25:38] when we are traveling to to take

[1:25:43] traveling to to go to these streets to
[1:25:46] see people who are going to translate
[1:25:50] in my heart i have very many questions
[1:25:52] and i am saying do these people know
[1:25:56] what
[1:25:57] god has done to make sure that they must
[1:26:00] do they even know
[1:26:04] do you know how many millions in that
[1:26:06] room to make sure my brother you get
[1:26:08] this book

[1:26:29] what god has interested in us
[1:26:32] my brother before you complain before do
[1:26:35] you know
[1:26:40] that's the reason the reason i was in

[1:27:30] prayer a few moments
[1:27:32] why did
[1:27:34] god
[1:27:35] have to have a pharaoh's heart to put
[1:27:37] the people to put the people back in the
[1:27:40] promised land before he could bless them
[1:27:44] to bring forth the messiah to them
[1:27:46] let us read this together
[1:27:50] why did god have to have them rushing
[1:27:52] into the camera
[1:27:54] why is it that sometimes things become
[1:27:56] hard
[1:27:57] why do you think the world now has
[1:28:00] reached where it is
[1:28:02] you know look
[1:28:04] go the heart in the pharaoh

[1:28:19] he had any fellows at heart to put the
[1:28:22] people back in the promised land
[1:28:24] before he could bless them to bring
[1:28:26] forth the messiah today you want to be
[1:28:29] blessed in a foreign land no

[1:28:46] still in egypt it is impossible that's
[1:28:48] right
[1:28:52] in egypt right
[1:28:55] so they wanted to push them out of this
[1:28:59] land

[1:43:09] and then he said
[1:43:10] it will take god's mighty hand to run
[1:43:14] out of bondage

[1:44:11] that is the word
[1:44:13] brethren that is the word of the lord

[1:44:53] of the children of israel amen amen
[1:44:57] wait for now
[1:45:15] but i'm telling you there are things
[1:45:18] sometimes they have to fight the bible
[1:45:21] says
[1:45:22] after jacob had blessed none after isaac
[1:45:25] had blessed jacob
[1:45:27] jacob instead of essa
[1:45:34] do you have something for me say no i
[1:45:36] don't have it i don't have my son
[1:45:39] but then he said
[1:45:40] that if you will fight if you will work
[1:45:45] ahead
[1:45:46] you will break off that yacht of your
[1:45:49] breath
[1:45:51] from the days of john the baptist
[1:45:53] the kingdom of
[1:45:55] god suffers fire
[1:45:59] do we have another john the baptist in
[1:46:01] our age we have another spirit of elijah
[1:46:03] at this age
[1:46:04] yes the kingdom of god is suffered by
[1:46:08] and the violence must take it by
[1:46:12] science is running so very quickly
[1:46:14] there's a book i remember oh god
[1:46:16] bringing to my remembrance well the
[1:46:18] problem was i think it was countdown he
[1:46:20] was talking about that
[1:46:22] as science goes higher
[1:46:25] the same weight that's in the spirit
[1:46:28] as science is advancing even the blind
[1:46:32] of christ in the spiritual things must
[1:46:33] be advanced right
[1:46:48] we shall take this land
[1:46:51] which is full of jebusites
[1:46:53] my brother blessed me last week
[1:46:56] which is full of jebusites anakin's
[1:46:59] humans
[1:47:00] but
[1:47:01] wait a minute
[1:47:04] with the groans
[1:47:06] with crime
[1:47:07] we need prayer like never
[1:47:12] as i summarized
[1:47:13] it was easy for elijah to close heaven
[1:47:16] but he had to to even put his head
[1:47:18] between his knees
[1:47:29] my brother my sister are you sure i have
[1:47:32] called out loud
[1:47:37] are you sure i am called out loud

[1:47:50] that is my holy ghost that is my
[1:47:51] promised land he continued shouting
[1:47:56] the woman with an issue of blood
[1:47:59] had to be bold enough to press through
[1:48:02] the crowds do you know that woman in
[1:48:05] nature bruh
[1:48:06] those days those people were not allowed
[1:48:08] to come in the public
[1:48:10] but he said no sir obama
[1:48:17] hannah had to pray like never
[1:48:20] before
[1:48:22] zacchaeus had to climb alex community to
[1:48:26] see jesus jesus was passing jesus
[1:48:35] this man realized at this age jesus was
[1:48:38] prophesying his person he said i must do
[1:48:41] what other people have not done

[1:49:02] now as i am reading this i want you to
[1:49:04] find yourself
[1:49:06] and i'm also finding myself brother
[1:49:09] peter had to prepare me

[1:49:15] the number of days
[1:49:17] the disciples had to wake him up when
[1:49:20] they were on the trouble
[1:49:26] they had to
[1:49:27] wake him up
[1:49:30] as long as let me read this as i finish

[1:49:36] they were obedient
[1:49:39] please listen to this my brothers my
[1:49:41] sister it is in the message don't bring

[1:49:50] as long as they were obedient
[1:49:52] as long as they wasn't grumbling and
[1:49:55] fasting
[1:49:56] as long as they were obedient and walked
[1:49:59] humbly before god
[1:50:01] god went before them
[1:50:04] and led them by the hand
[1:50:06] and packed them on the ego's wings
[1:50:10] but the minute they got out of order
[1:50:14] god separated himself from them that's
[1:50:17] right
[1:50:18] well
[1:50:19] the journey
[1:50:20] my sister i'm talking about your journey
[1:50:22] now the journey was only about 40 miles
[1:50:27] they could make it in a couple of three
[1:50:30] days
[1:50:32] and they were 40 years
[1:50:35] wandering around out there trying to get
[1:50:39] ready to go
[1:50:41] the journey
[1:50:42] of the rapture the journey of the
[1:50:46] children of israel getting out of the
[1:50:48] land of bullet the prophet jesus said it
[1:50:50] was like 40 miles or something
[1:50:53] but it took them 40 years
[1:50:56] my brother my sister
[1:50:59] as we are winding up as we are studying
[1:51:04] i don't know how many years
[1:51:07] the journey is taking for you
[1:51:09] and it is very possible
[1:51:11] to take
[1:51:12] a very long agenda
[1:51:15] if the
[1:51:16] physical exodus types the spiritual if
[1:51:20] people wonder
[1:51:22] it means even now
[1:51:24] people might be wondering
[1:51:28] time is faster brother
[1:51:30] my sister time is faster
[1:51:35] was not supposed to be 40 years in the
[1:51:36] wilderness
[1:51:38] it was a very short journey
[1:51:41] but the grammar
[1:51:42] the cry he has delayed he has none no no
[1:51:45] the one this
[1:51:48] [Music]
[1:51:50] god has given us his promises
[1:51:53] like he did to israel very mighty
[1:51:55] promises
[1:51:59] but you can be moving
[1:52:01] a journey of 40 days
[1:52:03] for 40 years

[1:52:24] [Music]
[1:52:26] [Applause]

[1:53:08] [Music]
[1:53:16] listen to god
[1:53:21] [Music]
[1:53:29] is
[1:53:31] [Music]
[1:53:41] you shall receive
[1:53:44] the holy ghost
[1:54:04] one more
[1:54:05] time we sent
[1:54:07] [Music]
[1:54:10] [Applause]
[1:54:14] times
[1:54:25] [Music]
[1:54:29] is
[1:54:34] [Music]
[1:54:51] [Music]
[1:55:00] [Music]
[1:55:05] see the brother read that scripture in
[1:55:08] exodus 3 19
[1:55:12] and he says i am sure that the king of
[1:55:14] egypt will not let you go
[1:55:18] and indeed this is true you know one
[1:55:20] thing i love about the message
[1:55:22] is that it's a message of types
[1:55:25] and how he types
[1:55:27] the the physical things with the
[1:55:29] spiritual the old testament with the new
[1:55:32] things that were happening there big
[1:55:34] shadows
[1:55:36] of what was happening in the end
[1:55:39] the end is now
[1:55:41] our time now
[1:55:43] so he says i am sure that the king of
[1:55:44] eden do not let you go
[1:55:49] no not by a mighty hand
[1:55:52] that was a very strong one
[1:55:54] and the preachers told us even today it
[1:55:57] is the same thing the king of egypt will
[1:55:59] not let you go no
[1:56:02] but by
[1:56:03] almighty
[1:56:05] what was the mighty heart at that time
[1:56:08] it was a ministry
[1:56:10] of a vindicated messenger
[1:56:13] it was a ministry of a man of god that
[1:56:16] is sent over down there to egypt
[1:56:19] and you remember as the preacher was
[1:56:20] saying when moses stood there oh yes
[1:56:24] hallelujah
[1:56:25] it was time for them to move
[1:56:29] the devil could not do them any longer
[1:56:32] why
[1:56:33] because god had vindicated moses
[1:56:36] god had sent moses
[1:56:38] the mighty hand of god was moses his
[1:56:41] ministry
[1:56:43] and those people
[1:56:45] after they had received the mothers that
[1:56:46] we had
[1:56:48] god had no delay
[1:56:50] god had not denied their deliverance but
[1:56:52] what were they doing they had received
[1:56:54] moses yes but what happened
[1:56:56] many of them rejected moses sure
[1:57:00] many of them and we know that there were
[1:57:02] two over two million
[1:57:04] but about around 72 million and almost
[1:57:06] all of them died in the desert
[1:57:08] and it was another generation that went
[1:57:11] in
[1:57:12] the promised land
[1:57:15] our place is supposed to be the promised
[1:57:16] land
[1:57:17] but many have died in the desert of
[1:57:20] doubt
[1:57:21] many have died in the desert before they
[1:57:24] receive the holy ghost
[1:57:27] of
[1:57:28] you know self-pity desert of peace
[1:57:30] they're not a problem
[1:57:34] you know the bible says the word of god
[1:57:35] is a designer of the truth
[1:57:38] i believe that the word of god is
[1:57:40] designing us
[1:57:42] you see he knows where each of us are
[1:57:45] even where no one knows he knows what
[1:57:47] you're thinking what your party what and
[1:57:49] what what is confusing you but the other
[1:57:51] god is designing you right and he's
[1:57:53] telling you look
[1:57:55] they
[1:57:56] died because of that desert because they
[1:57:58] died because of that they died because
[1:58:01] you know they they were not doing
[1:58:03] something right
[1:58:04] you know when the holy spirit moves when
[1:58:06] god is moving
[1:58:08] you need to be found in the right place
[1:58:10] just
[1:58:10] doing the right thing
[1:58:14] amen
[1:58:15] i kind of feel that the holy spirit is
[1:58:16] pushing us even in
[1:58:18] the services before but the man has been
[1:58:20] preaching brother
[1:58:23] brother joe also preached i've been also
[1:58:25] preaching and the holy spirit is pushing
[1:58:27] us
[1:58:28] to something
[1:58:30] in order to enter into a certain
[1:58:32] atmosphere
[1:58:34] for certain things to begin to happen
[1:58:38] why are we at this place
[1:58:40] are we at this place by by accident
[1:58:44] i want each of you to think
[1:58:47] those who are online
[1:58:50] sister winnie i saw your family there
[1:58:53] brother martin
[1:58:54] sister wanga
[1:58:56] sister rose i saw you there as well
[1:58:59] the different ones
[1:59:01] whoever you are those of you who are
[1:59:03] here but okay
[1:59:05] father-son
[1:59:07] why are we in this place now
[1:59:09] why are we here now
[1:59:12] god is bringing us into this place
[1:59:15] so that he can accomplish his will in
[1:59:17] our life
[1:59:19] but look
[1:59:20] we need to understand
[1:59:22] the place we are in
[1:59:24] and the time we are in
[1:59:28] of course
[1:59:29] we had that the man
[1:59:31] the father
[1:59:32] of joseph
[1:59:34] jacob
[1:59:36] was crying
[1:59:39] he was weeping
[1:59:40] all that time
[1:59:42] because of his son
[1:59:44] he did not know
[1:59:47] that actually his son
[1:59:49] was fulfilling
[1:59:51] his destiny which would be their destiny
[1:59:53] amen
[1:59:54] there is no place you are going to go to
[1:59:56] even if it is egypt if god wants you to
[1:59:59] be at such a place which is of course
[2:00:01] indeed
[2:00:02] in this case i want to mean suffering
[2:00:04] problem doubt worry kobe 19
[2:00:08] no school you are out of school two
[2:00:10] years don't know what the future is
[2:00:11] going to be like or your plans look as
[2:00:13] if they're shattered you know you are
[2:00:14] you're in a press play you never plan to
[2:00:16] be right now you don't know even what
[2:00:18] your job is going to be you know you
[2:00:19] know god has brought you into such a
[2:00:21] place so that you can fulfill your
[2:00:24] destiny
[2:00:24] there is no reason for you to doubt god
[2:00:28] amen like
[2:00:30] jacob the only thing he had to do was to
[2:00:32] enter into the anointing to enter the
[2:00:34] right atmosphere to understand the
[2:00:36] season and the time he was living in at
[2:00:40] that time so that he can be able to
[2:00:42] glorify god
[2:00:44] even without knowing what god is doing
[2:00:46] [Applause]
[2:00:48] now where does all of the glorified god
[2:00:50] god still did his
[2:00:53] do you know power it feels like when god
[2:00:55] is doing something for you
[2:00:57] and you don't know and your benefits are
[2:00:58] complaining do you know what it feels
[2:01:00] like
[2:01:01] do you know how the holy spirit feels
[2:01:03] when is planning something for you when
[2:01:05] he wants to do something for you and you
[2:01:07] are they are grumbling doubting we are
[2:01:09] very what's that you know you know
[2:01:11] we we are not satisfied
[2:01:14] jacob
