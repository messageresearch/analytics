[1:15:59] hallelujah
[1:16:02] amen how many are happy to be in the
[1:16:05] house of the Lord
[1:16:08] today I've seen there are many people
[1:16:10] here who do not have H Bibles when I'm
[1:16:14] reading they folding their
[1:16:21] arms uh I think in this ch we do not
[1:16:25] allow
[1:16:29] that we believe that every Christian
[1:16:32] should own a
[1:16:36] Bible but if you are not a Christian and
[1:16:38] you're just visiting
[1:16:42] us that is
[1:16:44] okay you you can be like that for a week
[1:16:47] or
[1:16:49] two after you become a
[1:16:52] Christian then you have to own a
[1:16:58] yeah but if you're a Christian and you
[1:16:59] don't have a
[1:17:02] Bible it is not
[1:17:05] right so if you are near someone who has
[1:17:07] no Bible tell them it is not
[1:17:13] right make it a point this
[1:17:16] year to find a
[1:17:19] Bible if you are so
[1:17:21] poor you cannot buy one
[1:17:25] we will help you to have
[1:17:28] one but everyone must have a
[1:17:33] Bible I I expected bigger
[1:17:38] amens
[1:17:41] amen um I do not know how to get into
[1:17:45] this I'm just going to speak for about
[1:17:47] 25
[1:17:51] minutes and then uh we shall go into uh
[1:17:55] food uh food washing and
[1:18:01] communion um you know communion is a
[1:18:05] very is a part of our Christian
[1:18:12] faith how many have ever been a part of
[1:18:15] communion
[1:18:18] or how many have
[1:18:22] never okay I I see several hands go
[1:18:26] up I wish I knew that you were so many I
[1:18:29] would have taken a teaching on
[1:18:34] [Music]
[1:18:36] communion uh maybe that means I should
[1:18:38] take one of these one of these services
[1:18:41] in the coming year I should take a
[1:18:43] service on that just to teach on on
[1:18:49] communion but generally speaking
[1:18:53] communion there are three
[1:18:57] ordinances three
[1:19:00] ordinances that that we were left or
[1:19:03] told to
[1:19:05] do one of
[1:19:07] them is water
[1:19:10] baptism I continue these three
[1:19:12] ordinances do not serve
[1:19:16] us none of them serve
[1:19:19] us but we do it because we are saved
[1:19:25] only the saved must do those
[1:19:29] three if you are still trying to get to
[1:19:32] know about it about
[1:19:36] salvation then you can wait to do
[1:19:38] them but only the
[1:19:41] saved are the ones who do or participate
[1:19:44] in those three
[1:19:46] ordinances it is for the
[1:19:49] church for the
[1:19:51] Believers those who have confessed
[1:19:53] Christ and have believed him the first
[1:19:57] ordinance that must be done by every
[1:20:02] believer these three are a
[1:20:04] must if you don't do them it is an
[1:20:08] indication you are not a
[1:20:11] Believer if you refuse to be a part of
[1:20:15] them even if you were a part of the
[1:20:19] church it shows you are not a
[1:20:22] Believer the very first
[1:20:25] is water
[1:20:28] baptism now water baptism is an is an
[1:20:31] ordinance of the Christian
[1:20:34] Church everyone that believes Jesus
[1:20:36] Christ as their
[1:20:38] savior the very first thing they must
[1:20:43] do is they must be baptized in much
[1:20:47] water not by
[1:20:49] sprinkling not by
[1:20:52] powering but by immersion
[1:20:56] deeping
[1:20:57] bar in much water in the name of the
[1:21:01] Lord Jesus
[1:21:03] Christ not in father son Holy
[1:21:07] Spirit but in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:21:11] Christ because that is the name above
[1:21:14] all
[1:21:16] names that is the name whereby we can be
[1:21:20] saved so every
[1:21:23] believer who has the gospel and believed
[1:21:26] with their hearts confess with their
[1:21:28] mouth they
[1:21:31] must be baptized in much water in the
[1:21:35] name of our Lord Jesus Christ does water
[1:21:38] bapti
[1:21:41] anyone no what a baptism is done by
[1:21:44] those who are
[1:21:48] saved how many understood that so after
[1:21:52] believing then you get baptized
[1:21:55] what a baptism doesn't make you a
[1:21:58] Believer you do it because you have
[1:22:02] believed amen why it is a symbol of the
[1:22:08] burial and
[1:22:11] Resurrection with of Jesus with Jesus
[1:22:14] Christ if you believe that Jesus died
[1:22:17] was buried and resurrected you do it in
[1:22:22] symbolic form
[1:22:24] to show his
[1:22:27] death resurrection and to show that you
[1:22:30] are identified with
[1:22:34] him that because you have been
[1:22:35] identified in his death and
[1:22:39] burial you've died to the world and you
[1:22:42] bued in water and then when you come up
[1:22:47] it's a symbol you will come up with
[1:22:50] him like he rose from the dead
[1:22:55] you will also rise
[1:22:56] again in the resurrection of the
[1:22:59] saints that is which we call the Rapture
[1:23:02] of the
[1:23:04] church so that's the first
[1:23:07] ordinance so every believer must do
[1:23:10] that the moment you believe that's the
[1:23:13] first thing you
[1:23:15] do the second
[1:23:17] thing that we we have been taught by
[1:23:20] Jesus to continue doing
[1:23:24] is to take of the
[1:23:28] bread which we call um um um which we
[1:23:33] call generally we call
[1:23:35] communion to take the
[1:23:38] bread this is uned
[1:23:41] bread you know in the Jew Jewish culture
[1:23:44] they used to call it uned
[1:23:48] bread in Uganda we call it
[1:23:58] there is
[1:23:59] no there is
[1:24:02] other there is
[1:24:05] no there is no
[1:24:07] anything what else do we there is no
[1:24:12] salt there is no cooking
[1:24:16] [Music]
[1:24:18] oil that is just burn on both sides
[1:24:24] you don't even understand it it looks
[1:24:28] weird it is like a
[1:24:34] scalp even if you put it in the mouth
[1:24:37] sounds
[1:24:38] weird when you look at
[1:24:43] it it looks beaten up looks
[1:24:47] bad it looks as if it has been beaten up
[1:24:50] it has broken up because
[1:24:55] it signifies the body of Christ so we
[1:24:59] eat that
[1:25:02] bread in
[1:25:05] remembrance of the
[1:25:07] body that Jesus Christ
[1:25:09] gave because we were
[1:25:14] guilty and um that's what I want to talk
[1:25:17] about today because I was
[1:25:21] guilty and then we take the wine
[1:25:25] which you know
[1:25:27] symbolizes um the many things we can
[1:25:30] talk about simulation of
[1:25:34] Revelation symbolizes the Holy
[1:25:37] Spirit symbolizes the many things we can
[1:25:40] talk about
[1:25:43] there symbolizes the
[1:25:46] blood praise the name of the
[1:25:48] Lord the blood of Jesus will never lose
[1:25:52] its power
[1:25:55] amen it increases in
[1:25:58] power it cannot lose its
[1:26:01] power that's why in wine we do not take
[1:26:04] grape
[1:26:11] juice we don't take a
[1:26:13] ju is the issue
[1:26:18] [Music]
[1:26:21] here it's the fruit of the Vine
[1:26:28] no just get this cuz the people will get
[1:26:30] confused as well it is a fruit of the
[1:26:33] vine it is grape it is from The
[1:26:37] Grapes it is from The Grapes I know you
[1:26:40] are Ugandan so you don't understand
[1:26:41] grapes because we don't grow grapes here
[1:26:44] but grapes is what they make wine
[1:26:50] from
[1:26:52] yes yes yes
[1:26:54] and um so it can you know you can take
[1:26:57] those
[1:26:59] grapes and you can make a ju out of
[1:27:04] them you see that is n it is called non
[1:27:09] alcoholic they sell it here even in
[1:27:12] shops they call grape
[1:27:16] juice it looks
[1:27:18] reddish but it is a non-alcoholic
[1:27:22] drink but you see wine
[1:27:25] you see wine is um um is is
[1:27:37] fermented
[1:27:50] fermented
[1:27:52] so so yes
[1:27:54] so the
[1:27:57] ju goes
[1:27:59] bitter and
[1:28:01] sour and it goes
[1:28:05] bad but the
[1:28:07] wine the longer it
[1:28:10] stays the more powerful it
[1:28:14] becom so that's the wine we
[1:28:20] take actually if you take much of it you
[1:28:23] get drunk
[1:28:27] but you see the reason we take
[1:28:30] that is
[1:28:32] because it
[1:28:34] symbolizes the power of the
[1:28:37] blood it symbolizes the power of the
[1:28:41] spirit it shall never lose its
[1:28:45] power the more the more it
[1:28:47] stays the more powerful it
[1:28:50] is and um we will read a few scriptures
[1:28:53] on it
[1:28:54] later just a few minutes to
[1:28:58] come so and then we also do feet
[1:29:03] washing so we do feet
[1:29:06] washing um of one
[1:29:09] another Jesus did that for the
[1:29:13] disciples and um you know at one time
[1:29:16] Peter said no don't wash my
[1:29:18] feet because you are my Lord he said
[1:29:22] okay if I don't wash your feet you are
[1:29:24] not a part of
[1:29:26] me so then Jesus um Peter said ah in
[1:29:31] that case wash also my head and my whole
[1:29:35] body you know he repented quickly he
[1:29:38] said if I can't be a part of
[1:29:41] you just wash me and wash all my
[1:29:45] body but you see the point here
[1:29:48] is we should wash another one another's
[1:29:51] feet
[1:29:54] being our
[1:29:55] Lord he humbled himself and washed the
[1:29:59] disciples
[1:30:00] feet as our
[1:30:03] example of humility of love and you know
[1:30:08] he did it and he told us to do the
[1:30:11] same and since that time Believers have
[1:30:15] been doing
[1:30:17] it and we are going to do it
[1:30:21] today even if your brother's feet has
[1:30:27] even if he came you know walking on
[1:30:31] feet that is the one you should
[1:30:35] choose
[1:30:38] come you know the the in the in the days
[1:30:41] of the
[1:30:43] Jews washing one someone's
[1:30:47] feet was a work of the Lonely People the
[1:30:52] poor you know when someone comes to your
[1:30:56] house you take him and wash his feet so
[1:31:00] there were those servants who were at
[1:31:01] the
[1:31:03] G washing their people's
[1:31:06] feet especially those digitar respected
[1:31:10] guests and then they would enter in when
[1:31:13] they are now clean it's a sign of
[1:31:15] showing
[1:31:17] respect love someone is received you
[1:31:21] remember when Jesus visited that house
[1:31:23] he used feet was not
[1:31:26] watched and he sat in a
[1:31:28] corner and you know that woman came and
[1:31:32] wash Jesus's feet with her own
[1:31:35] tears praise the name of the Lord oh my
[1:31:38] there's much we can talk
[1:31:39] about I think I'll take services on each
[1:31:42] of those
[1:31:44] subjects so we can understand the you
[1:31:47] know the significance of those
[1:31:51] things praise the name of the Lord
[1:31:54] hallelujah hallelujah but today I just
[1:31:57] want to take a few moments to talk about
[1:31:59] that subject just that those words
[1:32:01] because I was
[1:32:06] guilty he is despised and rejected of
[1:32:11] men there is no beauty that we should
[1:32:13] desire
[1:32:15] him a Man of
[1:32:17] Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we
[1:32:21] he and we heed as it were our from
[1:32:27] him he was
[1:32:29] despised and we esteemed him
[1:32:31] not surely he has borne our
[1:32:35] griefs he has CED our
[1:32:39] sorrows if you have Sorrows here
[1:32:42] today I want to say Jesus cared your
[1:32:46] Sorrows you should not go with your
[1:32:48] sorrow to another
[1:32:50] year he has carried your sorrow
[1:32:54] he has borne your
[1:32:56] griefs and yet they did not esteem
[1:33:02] him he was
[1:33:04] smitten he was afflicted of God and he
[1:33:08] says he was
[1:33:11] wounded for our
[1:33:14] transgressions he was
[1:33:17] breathed for our
[1:33:20] iniquities and with his stripes
[1:33:24] we are
[1:33:27] healed as you are taking communion
[1:33:30] today you are going to be
[1:33:33] healed I want you to have
[1:33:35] faith for any sickness you
[1:33:39] have you are going to be
[1:33:42] healed why because by his
[1:33:46] strikes we are
[1:33:48] healed not we shall be
[1:33:51] healed we are healed
[1:33:56] in the message the context the
[1:33:59] cont he says this CER
[1:34:02] bread it is made by
[1:34:05] Christians not everyone can come and
[1:34:07] make this
[1:34:09] bread it is made by Holy Ghost fi
[1:34:14] Christians it is unlived
[1:34:18] bread and if you will notice
[1:34:20] it when you place it in your mouth
[1:34:24] it's very
[1:34:26] rugged to be
[1:34:28] bitter it is wrinkled and
[1:34:31] broken it is
[1:34:34] mingled that means the
[1:34:37] broken mangled body of our Lord
[1:34:42] Jesus imagine Jesus was
[1:34:47] Guiltless but he carried our
[1:34:50] guil he was sinless
[1:34:53] cared our
[1:34:55] sin let me ask you a
[1:34:57] question when we talk about
[1:35:00] Grace I want us to understand the
[1:35:02] importance of
[1:35:06] grace many many
[1:35:09] people we even today we still
[1:35:12] think the works of the works we are
[1:35:15] going to
[1:35:17] do will qualify
[1:35:21] us to go to heaven
[1:35:28] right you're going to dress
[1:35:30] well and because of that you will
[1:35:33] go you are going to live right and
[1:35:36] because of that you will go you are
[1:35:39] going to talk right and because of that
[1:35:41] you go but I want you tonight to
[1:35:44] understand there is no amount of works
[1:35:47] you can
[1:35:49] do that can buy you salvation
[1:35:55] no amount of works we
[1:35:57] do that can buy us eternal
[1:36:00] life that is why we should quit trying
[1:36:04] to work our own
[1:36:10] Works pay attention to what I'm
[1:36:12] saying and
[1:36:15] understand we should quit trying to
[1:36:21] do why is Christianity very
[1:36:25] hard why does it seem like a burden to
[1:36:30] many because we are trying our
[1:36:33] best to live
[1:36:36] right let me tell you there was once a
[1:36:41] couple who lived without the
[1:36:46] devil sat was not known to
[1:36:49] them Temptation was not known to them
[1:36:53] they were
[1:36:54] perfect they were not born in sin they
[1:36:57] were spoken out of the mouth of
[1:37:01] God they were created in the image of
[1:37:04] God and that was Adam and
[1:37:06] Eve but they
[1:37:09] fell so what makes you
[1:37:11] think that you can try to do
[1:37:15] something to be better than Adam
[1:37:18] and there is no amount of
[1:37:21] works that you can try to do that can
[1:37:25] make you
[1:37:27] righteous the Bible says our works of
[1:37:31] righteous as filthy
[1:37:34] rocks before
[1:37:36] God whatever you try to
[1:37:39] do in your own power by
[1:37:43] trying now the year is ending many are
[1:37:46] going to
[1:37:47] say from today I am no longer going to
[1:37:50] do this you see what did you do there
[1:37:54] you
[1:37:56] committed to try and be
[1:37:59] good many of you I'm going to say now
[1:38:04] from
[1:38:05] today I am no longer going to contact
[1:38:08] these
[1:38:09] people you even change your number you
[1:38:12] delete those contacts you block them and
[1:38:15] you start a new
[1:38:17] le you open a new page you say I'm a new
[1:38:21] man now in this 2025
[1:38:24] I'm a new person now but before even the
[1:38:27] first day of 2025
[1:38:31] ends you realize you go back to all
[1:38:34] those things you made up your mind you
[1:38:35] will you will
[1:38:39] stop how many understand what I'm trying
[1:38:41] to talk about yes many times it has not
[1:38:46] worked why because we are trusting in
[1:38:50] our
[1:38:52] works are trusting in our
[1:38:55] abilities but you have to come to a
[1:38:58] place and understand you works and your
[1:39:02] abilities will always fail
[1:39:07] you no man has ever passed by his
[1:39:11] words no one in this Bible that we have
[1:39:14] ever read of that has passed by his
[1:39:20] words all have failed
[1:39:23] the Bible says all have
[1:39:27] SE all have sinen and have come short of
[1:39:30] the glory of
[1:39:32] God no one righteous no not
[1:39:36] one not one all of you including myself
[1:39:41] every one of us is a failure by
[1:39:45] default there are no amount of works we
[1:39:48] can
[1:39:50] do that can buy us salvation
[1:39:54] even a man who was very good at keeping
[1:39:56] the
[1:39:58] law you know he came to Jesus and he
[1:40:01] told him good
[1:40:02] Master what must I
[1:40:05] do to be saved he thought it's all about
[1:40:10] what because the laws of
[1:40:13] Moses told him many many
[1:40:17] works the Ten Commandments and
[1:40:19] everything see imagine that man was
[1:40:22] righteous as far as are concerned better
[1:40:24] than all of us
[1:40:29] here how many here can say since I was
[1:40:32] born I've never
[1:40:36] lied that man was better than all of you
[1:40:41] he had never
[1:40:42] lied he had never stolen he had never
[1:40:46] CED never doubt he had never all those
[1:40:50] Ten Commandments he kept them
[1:40:53] Jesus answered him he said what you want
[1:40:56] to know what you can do oh go and do the
[1:40:59] The Ten
[1:41:00] Commandments and he mentioned all of
[1:41:03] them and the man said Jesus I have done
[1:41:07] all of
[1:41:09] them since I was a
[1:41:12] child Jesus looked at him and he said
[1:41:16] you you said the correct thing Jesus
[1:41:20] accepted that this man was saying the
[1:41:22] truth
[1:41:24] he was perfect as far as the laws were
[1:41:29] concerned he was his Works were
[1:41:34] 100% but still he felt there was
[1:41:38] something
[1:41:40] Laing he wanted to know what can he do
[1:41:45] more than the Lo he had done
[1:41:50] well but Jesus told him I will now tell
[1:41:54] you there is one more thing that you
[1:41:57] must do one more thing you must do that
[1:42:02] you missed out the man said what is it
[1:42:06] he said to him go sell everything you
[1:42:10] have sell everything you
[1:42:12] have tell your neighbor sell everything
[1:42:15] you
[1:42:16] have sell everything you
[1:42:19] have oh come on tell your neighbor one
[1:42:21] more time
[1:42:24] sell everything you
[1:42:26] have that is what we need to
[1:42:30] do sell everything you
[1:42:33] have sell all your
[1:42:35] malice sell all your pride sell all your
[1:42:39] self
[1:42:41] rightousness sell all your
[1:42:44] Works give up your life die to the world
[1:42:49] all you think is important to you
[1:42:53] to come to a place where you see it as
[1:42:57] nothing where you Lift
[1:43:00] Jesus Higher Than
[1:43:02] Anything where you come to a place and
[1:43:06] say because I was
[1:43:09] guilty Jesus died that is the place
[1:43:14] where every believer
[1:43:16] must and said because I was guilty I
[1:43:19] have no good work in
[1:43:21] me I'm selling everything now let me
[1:43:25] become a fool for
[1:43:27] Christ let me be abused for
[1:43:30] Christ until we come to that place where
[1:43:34] we accept to become a
[1:43:36] fool for
[1:43:39] Christ we we get
[1:43:42] obsessed Christ when it come to
[1:43:46] worship if it is for Christ you do it
[1:43:50] like it is your only business
[1:43:54] you do it is
[1:43:56] heart amen whether you are preaching you
[1:44:01] are not preaching fearfully you are
[1:44:03] preaching with boldness I'm saying
[1:44:06] whatever you are doing be singing or
[1:44:08] playing an
[1:44:09] instrument I mean this should be your
[1:44:11] resolution this
[1:44:13] year sell
[1:44:16] everything give up even your friends and
[1:44:19] give up even the world give up the
[1:44:25] of you have to give up that
[1:44:30] feeling for Jesus I can do
[1:44:34] anything for Jesus I can become crazy
[1:44:38] for Jesus I can give up
[1:44:42] anything sometimes even
[1:44:45] parents yes the Bible says it sometimes
[1:44:48] you have to do
[1:44:50] that give up everything
[1:44:54] and the man the Bible says he was
[1:44:59] sad in his heart because he had great
[1:45:04] positions and he went
[1:45:06] away from Jesus but he was sad the
[1:45:10] moment you have an encounter with
[1:45:13] Jesus he is the
[1:45:16] word whether you believe it or not you
[1:45:19] can never be the same
[1:45:23] and to those of you hearing me
[1:45:25] today you can never be the same
[1:45:28] again you see when you don't believe it
[1:45:32] you will walk
[1:45:33] away but when you believe it amen you
[1:45:37] will totally be
[1:45:40] happy that's the only thing Jesus told
[1:45:42] to do the man to
[1:45:44] do said everything so what is it that he
[1:45:49] had to do is to obey what Jesus was
[1:45:52] saying
[1:45:54] is to become a
[1:45:55] Believer
[1:45:57] God Hallelujah in Jesus was telling him
[1:46:02] there is only one thing you have to
[1:46:04] do I have done everything for you only
[1:46:08] believe in

[1:46:29] what we are served by work come
[1:46:32] on by faith through
[1:46:36] Grace it is a gift of
[1:46:39] God no man can boast
[1:46:43] about by faith
[1:46:46] alone through
[1:46:49] Grace now Faith in
[1:46:51] what faith in a finished
[1:46:56] work are you understanding what I'm
[1:46:59] saying
[1:47:01] now here he came to the
[1:47:06] world because the world was
[1:47:09] sinful and because the world could not
[1:47:15] help the sin that was in
[1:47:18] them everyone was born in
[1:47:21] sin and you know man had to be broken
[1:47:24] and mangled and all those
[1:47:27] things and die so that he can be red but
[1:47:32] Jesus came and he changed the
[1:47:37] holy he came because I was
[1:47:40] guilty he came because I was a sinner he
[1:47:44] came because I couldn't do it on my
[1:47:47] own he came because I had
[1:47:51] transgression he came because I had
[1:47:55] iniquity and he came and he was
[1:47:58] wounded for my
[1:48:00] transgression and he was breathed
[1:48:03] because of my iniquities and the Bible
[1:48:05] says by his
[1:48:08] stripes not mine
[1:48:11] his I am
[1:48:13] healed I am healed I am healed from sin
[1:48:18] I am healed from disease I am healed
[1:48:20] from the world I am healed from every of
[1:48:23] Darkness I am
[1:48:25] healed because he
[1:48:28] came so it is all because of Jesus
[1:48:31] Christ that's all we need to do to have
[1:48:36] faith in his finished
[1:48:41] work hallelujah hallelujah and when you
[1:48:44] receive that
[1:48:46] Faith he fills you with the baptism of
[1:48:49] the Holy Spirit
[1:48:53] and now that Holy Spirit Will begin to
[1:48:57] do every
[1:48:59] work every good work so you don't
[1:49:04] struggle on your
[1:49:06] own you don't
[1:49:08] struggle say oh my
[1:49:10] God I love that
[1:49:13] smoke oh God take it from
[1:49:21] me I don't struggle
[1:49:23] anymore it is by
[1:49:26] Grace It Is by
[1:49:28] grace even when I smell
[1:49:31] cigarette I feel like
[1:49:34] vomiting why Grace took over in my
[1:49:38] life took away the
[1:49:41] appetite I don't love smoking I don't
[1:49:45] love drinking don't love
[1:49:48] immorality why because Grace took away
[1:49:54] he took away my life and he gave me his
[1:49:58] life now the life I live is not my life
[1:50:03] it is his life living in my life I am
[1:50:07] living because of him my life is dead
[1:50:11] and I'm alive in Jesus
[1:50:13] Christ that is the message we
[1:50:17] believe praise the name of the
[1:50:20] Lord hallelujah hallelujah
[1:50:24] praise
[1:50:26] God so if you see yourself
[1:50:29] struggling simply means you've not yet
[1:50:34] received the Holy
[1:50:37] Spirit but when you do it's all
[1:50:43] over what did he
[1:50:45] do the wrath of God was upon us for
[1:50:48] being
[1:50:51] Sinners no one could save
[1:50:54] him there is nothing we could
[1:50:56] do we are all born in sin sh in
[1:51:00] iniquity the word speaking life and what
[1:51:04] did he
[1:51:05] do he came to the Earth hallelujah
[1:51:08] hallelujah and tread the wine press all
[1:51:10] the Wrath of the almighty God was upon
[1:51:12] powered out upon
[1:51:17] Him Thou Art
[1:51:20] Worthy oh Lamb of God
[1:51:23] for you were
[1:51:25] slain taking the sins of the
[1:51:28] world and he B our
[1:51:31] sin that God powered out the fierceness
[1:51:34] of his wrath upon
[1:51:36] you you don't have to worry about your
[1:51:39] sins
[1:51:40] now the only thing is to do to repent of
[1:51:43] your
[1:51:44] sins and leave his blood to
[1:51:49] cover amen and he was wounded for our
[1:51:51] transgression
[1:51:54] he was breeed for our
[1:51:55] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:51:58] upon
[1:51:59] him his stripes we were
[1:52:05] healed never man did like that
[1:52:09] man he suffered until the blood and
[1:52:12] water separated in his
[1:52:16] body and the drops of blood dropped out
[1:52:19] of his of his brao before his death
[1:52:26] praise the Lord let us lastly read
[1:52:29] Revelation
[1:52:34] 5 vers
[1:52:37] one and I saw in the right hand of him
[1:52:40] that sat on the throne a book written
[1:52:42] within and on the back side sealed with
[1:52:45] Seven Seals
[1:52:55] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:52:57] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[1:53:00] the book and to lose the seals
[1:53:11] thereof and no man in heaven knowing
[1:53:14] Earth neither under the Earth was able
[1:53:16] to open the book neither to look their
[1:53:18] on
[1:53:27] there was no man in
[1:53:29] heaven there was no one in Earth there
[1:53:33] was no one under the
[1:53:35] Earth I'm saying there was no
[1:53:38] one every place that ever
[1:53:41] existed there was no one that was worthy
[1:53:46] what is this book the book is a book of
[1:53:50] redemption
[1:53:52] it contained the names of all those that
[1:53:55] were to be
[1:53:58] redeemed the names were in
[1:54:01] there they were
[1:54:03] predestinated they were known before the
[1:54:05] found of the world their identity was in
[1:54:09] there are you hearing me church but you
[1:54:13] see the book was
[1:54:16] sealed with Seven
[1:54:18] Seals so these could not know that they
[1:54:21] were in there
[1:54:25] I'm trying to simplify it for for us now
[1:54:29] but you see he said here you know there
[1:54:32] was no
[1:54:34] man in heaven on Earth under the Earth
[1:54:39] that was
[1:54:40] worthy what is
[1:54:42] this there was no one able to
[1:54:46] save there was no one able to
[1:54:49] redeem everyone was a sinner from Adam
[1:54:54] to Moses to Abraham everyone was a
[1:54:58] sinner no one was
[1:55:02] worthy because you see being a son of a
[1:55:04] sinner you become a
[1:55:07] sinner so no one was a was able to open
[1:55:10] the
[1:55:12] book and I wept much because no man was
[1:55:16] found
[1:55:17] worthy to open and to read the
[1:55:19] book neither to look their on
[1:55:23] and one of the elders said unto
[1:55:25] me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe
[1:55:29] of
[1:55:30] Judah the root of
[1:55:33] David has
[1:55:35] prevailed oh
[1:55:37] hallelujah amen the lion of the tribe of
[1:55:42] Judah the lion of the tribe of
[1:55:45] Judah the root of
[1:55:47] David has
[1:55:49] prevailed to open the book
[1:55:52] to lose the Seven Seals
[1:55:55] they who is this
[1:55:57] lion I ask you who is this
[1:56:01] lion lion is a
[1:56:03] king king of kings but is not just a
[1:56:07] king is the king of the tribe of
[1:56:11] Judah the root of David and remember God
[1:56:15] promised David and everlasting
[1:56:18] Kingdom a kingdom Without End
[1:56:22] this one who is Worthy is the root of
[1:56:25] David he a li so he's a
[1:56:30] king and I beheld and law in the midst
[1:56:34] of the
[1:56:35] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[1:56:38] midst of the
[1:56:39] elders I saw a
[1:56:42] lamb so when the voice told John that
[1:56:45] the lion of the tribe of
[1:56:49] Judah John turn to see
[1:56:52] that lion and when he turned to see he
[1:56:56] saw what he saw a
[1:56:58] lamb a lamb it was not a living lamb it
[1:57:03] was a dead
[1:57:05] lamb do you understand what I'm talking
[1:57:09] about the lion became the
[1:57:13] lamb God is a spirit God is the king of
[1:57:17] kings but God he became a l
[1:57:22] himself and became a man who was Jesus
[1:57:27] he was the Lamb of
[1:57:29] God Tak away the SS of the world so when
[1:57:32] John turned to see he didn't see the
[1:57:35] lion but he saw the lamb who was Jesus
[1:57:40] he was God himself who put on flesh to
[1:57:44] come and die for our
[1:57:47] sin God
[1:57:49] himself there was no one could save her
[1:57:53] we were all lost we were all lost in our
[1:57:56] sin
[1:57:57] trespasses no one could save us I tell
[1:58:01] you no one can save you
[1:58:03] today your pastor can't save you your
[1:58:06] brother can't save you your mother can't
[1:58:08] save your father can't save it but there
[1:58:11] one who can save even your Prophet can't
[1:58:16] save is it amen but there is one who can
[1:58:19] save us the Lamb of God
[1:58:23] Jesus
[1:58:26] Christ he was
[1:58:28] slain having hor seven having seven
[1:58:31] horns and seven
[1:58:34] eyes and he came and took the
[1:58:37] book out of the right hand of him that
[1:58:40] sat upon
[1:58:41] the praise the name of the
[1:58:44] Lord we are the people of the open
[1:58:49] book Revelation 10
[1:58:53] an angel came down having an open
[1:58:56] book and you know what we have had our
[1:58:58] names being
[1:59:00] called my name was on the book your name
[1:59:04] is on the book the names of all those
[1:59:07] who
[1:59:07] [Music]
[1:59:08] believe by faith you realize those who
[1:59:11] are going in the
[1:59:14] Rapture listen to this they are not
[1:59:17] going to the
[1:59:18] Rapture on the basis of works
[1:59:25] I am not saying their Works will be
[1:59:28] bad I'm saying not they will not go on
[1:59:31] the basis of their
[1:59:32] [Music]
[1:59:35] Works they will go on the basis of his
[1:59:39] work we are actually the real people the
[1:59:42] beneficiaries of the of the
[1:59:47] Cross because by his work we are SA we
[1:59:52] can prove it because our life changed
[1:59:55] the things we used to do we don't do
[1:59:56] them
[1:59:58] anymore our sisters don't wear
[2:00:01] trousers they don't dress naked they
[2:00:04] don't walk out
[2:00:05] naked our brothers they don't go around
[2:00:08] chasing after
[2:00:10] girls our sisters our Holy Ghost fi they
[2:00:14] changed those are the ones I'm talking
[2:00:16] about those are the
[2:00:19] redeemed and those are the ones going in
[2:00:21] rapture
[2:00:23] praise the name of the Lord and their
[2:00:25] names were
[2:00:27] called and I believe I'm one of
[2:00:30] them because I was
[2:00:33] guilty he came and died he came and gave
[2:00:36] his body he was bitten he was stri
[2:00:41] naked he he he was
[2:00:44] smitten his body was
[2:00:47] mang and he shed his
[2:00:50] blood all for me
[2:00:55] praise the
[2:00:58] Lord hallelujah
[2:01:04] hallelujah now I just want to change the
[2:01:06] order of the
[2:01:09] service in the communion
[2:01:12] message the prophet says many of the
[2:01:14] churches has closed
[2:01:16] communion Clos communion
[2:01:24] they have closed
[2:01:31] communion that is just to their own
[2:01:35] church when they have their
[2:01:37] communion but here we are not a
[2:01:42] denomination we have a we have a open
[2:01:45] communion for
[2:01:49] all for we believe that every
[2:01:53] believer has a right to the table of the
[2:01:58] Lord and to Fellowship around the good
[2:02:01] things of
[2:02:03] God with every believer regardless of
[2:02:05] GRE color or whatever he may
[2:02:09] be that all have been made to drink of
[2:02:12] the self same
[2:02:16] blessing that is Christ shall we turn to
[2:02:20] 1 Corinthians 11
[2:02:27] so you can see what we are going to
[2:02:39] do can I have one or two deons close by
[2:02:44] please First Corinthians 11:
[2:02:49] 23 it says for I have received of the
[2:02:52] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[2:02:55] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[2:02:58] in the which he was betrayed took
[2:03:01] bread you can read
[2:03:16] verse and when he had given thanks he
[2:03:19] broke it
[2:03:21] and say take it this is my body which is
[2:03:25] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[2:03:37] me after the same manner also he took
[2:03:40] the
[2:03:41] cup when he had
[2:03:44] sapped saying when he had
[2:03:48] sapped okay that is the cup like
[2:03:51] drinking
[2:03:53] saying this cup is the is the New
[2:03:55] Testament in my
[2:03:59] blood this do ye as often as ye drink it
[2:04:03] in remembrance of
[2:04:09] me
[2:04:11] amen believer say
[2:04:14] amen for as often as he eat this
[2:04:18] bread and drink this cup
[2:04:22] ye do show the Lord his death till he
[2:04:28] come when we eat that
[2:04:30] bread we are showing that Jesus died for
[2:04:35] me for me he
[2:04:38] died because I was
[2:04:40] guilty that is to say I am no longer
[2:04:45] guilty hallelujah hallelujah
[2:04:52] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[2:04:55] and drink this cup of the Lord
[2:05:05] unworthily shall be guilty of the blood
[2:05:10] of the body and the blood of the
[2:05:15] [Music]
[2:05:16] Lord You Have To don't just come and you
[2:05:19] know this is not like at home taking
[2:05:21] food or just drinking
[2:05:26] things you are showing the Lord is
[2:05:30] death that he died for you but if he
[2:05:33] died for you have you really given your
[2:05:36] life to
[2:05:37] him is your life surrendered to
[2:05:40] him or you are living under unconfessed
[2:05:46] sins before you take
[2:05:48] it put your life right
[2:05:53] because if you
[2:05:54] don't he says you are
[2:05:57] guilty of the body and the blood
[2:06:02] of but let a man examine
[2:06:06] himself and so let him eat of that
[2:06:10] bread and drink of that
[2:06:13] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[2:06:18] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[2:06:21] to himself
[2:06:25] not designing the Lord's
[2:06:27] body for this
[2:06:29] cause many are
[2:06:32] weak and sickly among you and many
[2:06:41] die so this is not a
[2:06:44] joke for if we would judge
[2:06:47] ourselves we should not be
[2:06:50] judged but when we are
[2:06:52] judged we are chested of the
[2:06:55] Lord that we should not be condemned
[2:06:58] with the
[2:07:00] world where for my brethren when you
[2:07:03] come together to
[2:07:04] eat t one for
[2:07:07] another and if any man
[2:07:11] hunger let him eat at
[2:07:13] home that ye come not together un
[2:07:17] condemnation
