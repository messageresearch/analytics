our desire Lord our craving in our hearts and even as we meet for the first day of this year Lord Jesus in this first service of 2024 on Wednesday evening it is our desire Lord that you will help us to realize we do not have very much time left before you come to take the waiting bride away bring us closer to you in everything that we do Lord may we have a longing in our hearts for you and Lord even as we go now to open the pages of your word I ask that the holy spirit will help me to be able to minister the needs of your people and that by the end of the service every one of us would have been brought closer to you is our desire Grant it I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you all I greet you in the name of Jesus Christ um we have uh our first service to today in 2024 so it's a blessing to be in the house of the Lord and it's a blessing to see that God has kept us well uh the devil started with Brother Sam wanted to take his life but he failed and now last night the devil also tried to take the life of our sister uh Stella as they were riding on a motorbike and they had an accident and she was in the rush to the hospital last night Exodus chapter 14: 13 to 15 I hope that all of us are praying for the Youth meetings uh which are going to hold next week uh we have we have uh more than 200 people already registered and many are still registering and that excludes the team coming from Kenya uh and and so there's quite a lot so if you've not registered please I request that you register there's quite a lot ahead of us and we are trusting that God will come and visit the young people during that time Exodus chter 14 we are reading from vers 13 and Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show unto you today for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace and um the Lord said to Moses wherefore CRI thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward praise the name of the Lord amen you may be seated may the Lord add blessings upon the reading of the word so I trust that everybody will be fine with the English this evening is that amen so I'm speaking on Escape for your life and I know that uh I I shared on the same scripture at the beginning uh the end of last year and the beginning of this this year but today I want to dwell so much on verse 15 which says and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore Christ thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward now you realize that uh when God had called the children of Israel coming from Egypt going to the promised land in uh in in in Canaan God desired that they would believe on whom he had sent of course God had sent Moses and Moses heard thus saith the Lord you realize that when God sends a person in your life what they have for you is not a maybe happen or maybe it will happen it is a must happen because they are sent from God to your life and that that uh applies not only to Moses and the Israelites but it applies also to us in our generation and uh the prophet that God has sent in our generation our brother William Branham his message is not a maybe happen or maybe will happen what he says or maybe it might happen or it may not happen uh you know the Bible speaks of a gift of Prophecy and how that when someone has a gift of Prophecy it it will all you don't just believe it you know when someone prophesies or gives a uh someone has a gift of Prophecy and and says something you don't just believe and swallow everything they are saying it has to be proved again by uh two people at least who are spiritual to say whether those things are true or not you know there's a difference between a prophet and a gift of Prophecy and now a prophet is born a prophet and uh when a prophet speaks what he says is thus sayth the Lord it cannot fail it will always come to pass but but someone with a gift of Prophecy he can it will sometimes even have a margin of error and even sometimes even if it it does not you cannot be 100% sure it is God until it has been judged you know that kind of prophecies is usually judged by spiritual people or men who are filled with the Holy Spirit to tell whether those things are of God or not but we see that in our time we have received a a prophet like God had sent Moses Moses was a prophet and Moses was born a prophet he was not a man with a gift of Prophecy he was a prophet sent a man sent from God and we see in our generation we have also a man sent from God William branam a man sent from God his message is thus saith the Lord his message cannot fail just like the message of Moses did not fail everything Moses said came to pass because Moses's message was not his idea his message was not learned from somewhere his message was 100% from God and there it was of God and it did not fail but you see one thing that I wanted to highlight here while we are beginning is that the message of Moses was Escape for your life he had brought a message to Israel and it had it had you know of course it was from God but the Jews or the Israelites had to believe everything Moses said if they did not believe what Moses said then it would it was not going to be applied upon their life they had to believe him as a prophet as a man sent from God they had to believe that what he had was not his idea or his opinion but what he had in his heart and what God had laid on his mouth was thus sayith the Lord can we say Amen to that so in the same way here we see that Moses now of course we already covered the other part where they were coming from uh from Egypt and how they had the pass overnight and how he he fulfilled everything God had told him to do and how they should eat the bread and um the meat and um how they should arrange everything and on that pass overnight the angel of death came and he passed over the houses of those that um had eaten and had applied the blood on their on their doors so we see that the angel of the Lord walked with Moses the whole time and now here they have come all the way from Egypt and Pharaoh had told them now you can go but you see when they arrived at the Red Sea before the crossing of the Red Sea that is where now Pharaoh now said to himself he came to himself what have I done how could I let them go and so he came with many Chariots of many of his Warriors to come and destroy uh and destroy the Israelites but here God speaks to Moses and he said uh and he tells him to speak and to go forward but before then Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which will show to you today I want to say this whenever you know that where you are you are in the right place place where what you are hearing is the right message I want to tell you always fear not because God is with you and he will surely give you salvation no matter what you are going through in your life and here he says the Egyptians you see today you will see them again no more forever and he says the Lord shall fight for you and he shall hold your peace God always fights for his people are you not so glad that God always fights for you God always fights for you God always fights for me can you say it God always fights for me Hallelujah did you know that he even fights for you battles you did not know that you were fighting amen there are those that we know we are fighting but there are also those other battles we are fighting but we don't know that we are fighting but God always goes behind us he goes before us he goes around us to fight every battle for us hallelujah as long as we are right in the place where where he wants us to be but now I want you to see that the Lord said unto Moses at that same time he says where Christ thou why do you cry and brother banam uh spoke on that why cry speak and he says why cry unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward that's what God requires for us to go forward to escape to go forward I I want you to follow this thought when they were coming from Egypt they were they thought they were slaves in their mind they had a mind set of a slave and they were only thinking that they were slaves did you know that you God can actually save you by his word but if you are mind has not agreed to what God has done for you you may not actually achieve your victory many times you preach the word but how many people would receive it and say that is nothing but the truth and absolutely the truth and I will do it very few many people will hear it they will say it is the truth but it is impossible to do it it is impossible to fulfill it but how many of you will always fulfill be ready and be willing to do what God the word of God said for them to do I want to be among those that will fulfill the portion of the word of God for my day and we see that uh when God sent them a prophet why did he send a prophet he sent them that Prophet for that Prophet his message to lead them from Egypt to the promised land and they had to go to the promised land and and here they have arrived at the Red Sea did you know that in everything God had told Moses he had not told him about the Red Sea he didn't know about the Red Sea it was a surprise when he found a red sea so he began crying why because he did not know that there was going to be a a Red Sea all that God told him is you are going to take them from go tell Pharaoh let my people go so he expected that the hardest part of this journey was going to tell Pharaoh let my people go but after that hard part was done then he arrived at a place where he never did you know it is actually God who led them to the Red Sea he told them pass here pass here pass here pass here by the pillar of fire and he led them right straight to the Red Sea why because when God sends his word his word will always work no matter the obstacles that ahead of you his word is fashion in such a way that it is so powerful the Bible says the word of God is powerful that it can even divide Soul and Spirit it can put it a it is so powerful and I want to tell you that there is nothing that the word of God cannot accomplish in our lives if only we can believe every word of God every word of God not some but every word of God and I want you to see here when he when he arrives at the Red Sea he begins crying oh God I never knew about this part but then simply God tells him why cry Moses speak to the children of Israel and go forward and uh in one way I would say that God was telling him just Escape for your life if you stay here they're going to come and Kill You Escape run go go forward and I believe this is what as we are beginning this year what God is telling us to go forward there are many obstacles that are going to hind us there are many things that are going to come before us brother there are many things that are going to discourage us brother there are many things sister that are going to come before you that will make you feel that you can't go forward but I believe God is telling us the same thing this evening amen that go forward go forward Lord this year is made up to destroy us Lord this year the age the generation the the time that we living in is made up in such a way that it wants it will it is made up to destroy us just like the army of Pharaoh was made up to destroy Israel but I want you to see in the Book of John Chap 10:1 and I'll just it just be a short sharing this evening because we are also recording for the zoom so it will not be more than 1 hour so listen to me carefully in John 10:10 it says the thief cometh not but to steal to kill and to destroy but Jesus says I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly you know when the Devil comes into our lives he he comes to to to to to steal the the word of God that he that God has planted in our hearts the devil desires to steal our Zeal the devil desires to steal our desire for the things of God the devil desires to kill amen that desire each of you each of us here have a desire to to serve God that's why we are here this evening did you know that we have a desire within us to serve God and that's why we are here or else we would not even have come here but I am here because because I love the Lord with all my heart and and the devil knows that God knows that but the devil knows that too and the devil's purpose is to come and steal not only to steal but to kill and to destroy that which God has placed within your heart but what does Jesus come to do through his word he comes that we might have life and have it more abundantly in other words Jesus doesn't want us to have just a little life he wants us to have Abundant Life he wants us to have more life Beautiful Life Big Life wonderful life not just a little life but a great life tell me where else can we get an abundant life out of the word you cannot get life abundant life outside of the word of God and I want to show you something here I quickly go to the B that I have for you this evening we are back again to the days of lot the generation that we are living in we are back again the to the days of Noah you know brother bam would say that history keeps repeating itself things that are happening now have happened before there is no new thing under the sun whatever is happening now has happened before and whatever shall happen has really happened before now we are saying we in the end time but there were other times that people or men of God preached and told the people we are in the end time I want you to turn your Bibles with me to the Book of Luke chapter 17 and look at verse 26 it says as it was as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all I want you to think about let me bring this down from the scriptures down to our own individual your lives isn't this the same thing that is happening today you know the Bible says that uh they ate they drunk they married wives they were given in marriage until the day Noah entered into the ark now I want you to remember when God had given the message uh the message of Salvation to Noah to bring to the people of the of that time do you realize I want you to see a few things about the message of Noah do you realize that the message of Noah was for the whole world it was not a denominational message it was a message for the whole world they were all supposed to receive the message of Noah imagine even here in Uganda they were supposed to receive the message of Noah if there were people here all over the world they were supposed to hear the message of Noah the people that lived in that time that is a hard fact not very many people will believe it or will actually think about it that way but that was the truth it was a message for the whole world that's the fact number number one fact number two when the people heard that message they did not take it serious or maybe the message became so common to them that they they all of them knew that it was going to rain they had not that they knew but that they had it was going to rain so they knew by information that it was going to rain but they continued normally they were not deterred from whatever they were doing those who were drinking continued to drink those who were committing fornication continued normally no problem as if there's nothing going to happen those who were you know eating they contined to eat those who were marrying continued to marry as if there was nothing happening going to happen you know he's trying to show us that life continued as normal as if there was nothing going to happen I wonder whether we have also arrived at the same time friends where God has sent another message this time but also this message is a message to the entire world just like it was in the days of Noah and we have received that message that message has been recorded I I don't know how it was in the days of Noah but I am inclined to believe that message might have been recorded brother omnet because the prophet of God tells us you see that time they had civilization Before the Flood Before the Flood they had civilization which was actually greater than the one we have today did you know know that because they build they buildt things we cannot build today they built the Great Pyramid of Giza we know who built the Great Pyramid of Giza the the archaeologists and the scientists don't know but our Prophet has told us who built that pyramid and if you want to know him go and read the message but I'll just give you a tip Enoch and he said that Enoch was a prophet and Enoch is the one who built he was a prophet of God and he was the one who built that Great Pyramid of G is a structure which is in the true north perfectly in the middle of the Earth and when you look at it I mean I can explain a lot about that Pyramid of Giza but you will see that he called he called that the second Bible the second Bible the first Bible being the uh being the moon the stars and and all that and then the the second Bible being the pyramid and the third Bible being the one we have in our hands God has been dealing with the human race ever since but we see that during that time these people you know we perfect in Geometry they were perfect in everything they knew they were the civilization of that time was really much higher than the one we have today now we think we have cars now we think we have internet now we think we have you know good clothes now we think we have microphones and we can speak through microphones and people can hear us even in a you know in a very big distance but at that time they had it all maybe I I'm not wrong to say that maybe even in the days of Noah they had recorded the message and that message Noah had recorded it and it had been played on TV on television it had been played on radios and it had gone all over the world why do you think God took all those years to destroy or to bring down rain he was waiting for the message of Noah to go all over the world and the message of Noah went all over the world but people had the message of Noah but people did not take it serious that is the problem we have had in every generation that when God sends a message people don't take that message serious oh God help us that we don't also fall victims of that and the Bible says in the days of Noah what did they do they they married wives they ate they drank and they gave in marriage until the day Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all I want you to imagine I don't know how many people were on Earth at the time time but out of all the millions of the people that might have been on the earth at that time we know that only how many Souls we are saved eight Souls only eight Souls were saved out of the millions of souls do you think do you think that God will not do it again if he has to are you hearing me church is God able to do it again now I ask you a question will you be in the number of those that will be saved or you are going to remain down here in the tribulation as far as I'm concerned I do not know what 2024 holds but I want 2024 to prepare me for the coming of the Lord in my heart I'm longing for his return in my heart I'm longing for his return whatever I do whatever I say whatever I think I want to be right with him I want to be right I want my mind to be right with God I want my words to be right with God I want my actions to be right with God I want to be ready for his return and we see that the Bible says here that uh you know no they did everything they did until the day why listen please closely here until meaning they did everything they were doing but they stopped doing what they were doing when that day arrived which means when the day of entering the ark arrived and the rain began coming down that's when the people the people's eyes opened up and they said wait a moment something is happening we have to change we have to go in the ark and remember when the door was closed closed it was closed it could not be opened again all hope was lost all even you know Grace Grace was over the door was shut who shut that door God himself who gave the message shut the door and let me tell you history keeps repeating itself God is going to do the same thing in our generation but what was wrong at the time people never bothered we never bothered until the day Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and when that happened it destroyed them all listen sister put that in your mind put that in your head put that in your in your understanding and think about it for just a moment they had the message they had the message of escaping they were supposed to escape for their life they had it all but they left it all and they were destroyed all they were destroyed all what does the devil come to do the Devil comes to do what to steal to kill and to destroy and the devil is at it again we have now also received another message another end time message in our day and now the devil is trying to do what to destroy people people can you imagine that people will sit in the churches of of of Believers people will sit in the churches of message Believers all over the world but very few people will go in the rapture can you imagine that which means that people will actually be in the church but they will actually be you know destroyed by the enemy they will actually be killed they will actually be stol from what they have received why because they have not give come to a place of toal surrender I don't want to be guilty of that I want to if I'm going to serve God I want to serve God with all my heart I want to be genuine I want to be really genuine I want to be found ready not because of my works but because of my heart the status of your heart when the word of God comes to you do you tremble when the word of God comes to you do you really receive it do you accept it do you put it in your heart or you simply just blush it away and and say well it's all right we have had this over and over listen to me sister listen to me brother there is coming a day you'll hear it your last day and that day may be today time is coming when the time of hearing this message will be over and the door will be shut but when the door has not yet been shut this is the time for you my sister my brother to run for your life and God has laid a few things in my heart to say to you today I trust that you you shall receive it in the spirit with which I have received it and verses 28 it says likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day h the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be the days when the son of man is revealed I say we are living in that day of the son of man being revealed we are here once again and this he says how will it as it was in those days he first said as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of Noah what were people doing they were eating they were drinking they were marrying they were doing whatever they were doing life continued on normally until the day when Noah entered the Ark and they were all destroyed and now he saying here again as it was in the days of lot what did they do they ate they drun they bought they sold they planted they builded these are the things that are taking us away from the presence of God I have to buy this I have to buy that I have to build this I have to plant this I have to eat this I have to drink please tell me what else do we do out of the presence of God what else is it not eating and drinking and building and dressing and buying and selling is there something else that's all so go what is God trying to say here he say that everything else does not matter but his message which he has sent in a generation that message is what is important everything else does not matter that message brother that message sister take to that message because time is coming when the opportunity for you to receive that message will no longer be there time is coming when the door will be shut brother sister it is good for you to get married but marriage does not matter it is good for you to buy but buying does not matter it is good for you to sell it is good for you to build or or go to school or you know become You Know Rich and things like that but those things don't matter what what matters is the message what matters is the message and how will you know that that is what matters in your life if you take it more important than anything else and time comes when people think that coming to church is not important they think that coming to church is helping the pastor and then you come to church and begin dozing around as if you don't know why you came to church and then you come to church and then you just begin you know not paying attention let me let me tell you brother sister who is not serious oh let me talk to the luk one believer today time is coming when you are dosing amen will not help you time is coming when your un seriousness will be all over your head and you have no hope all hope will be lost all Grace will be over but let me tell you brother I am not waiting for that time I want to be on fire for God and I want to be on fire for God now now not then I am not waiting for the last minute I'm waiting Hallelujah for the Rapture and I want to be ready for the Rapture now we don't have time for hating one another we don't have time amen for speaking ill about one another we don't have time for fornication we don't have time for adultery we don't have time for all the things of the world listen we don't have time for those things our time should be a consecrated life we should consecrate our life listen young people we should consecrate Our Lives to Jesus in these closing moments of time and the time came and the Bible says on that same day lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone now let me show you something here The Bride is holding everything together when the bride goes it's going to become a mess you may see the world continuing normally right now but don't be deceived it's continuing normally because the bride is here and when the bride is out of here things will not be the same again and in a few moments if you can listen to me with all your heart I believe just open your heart and see how God will deal with you this evening and because our desire is to be ready for his coming amen Exodus 14:26 he says and the Lord said unto Moses stretch out thine hand over the sea that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians upon their chariots and upon their Horsemen and Moses stretched forth his hand uh Moses stretched forth his um uh forth his hand over the Over the Sea and the Sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared and the Egyptians fled against it and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the Sea and the waters returned and covered the Chariots and the horsemen and all the host of the Pharaoh of pharaoh that came into the sea after them there remained not so much as one of them but the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the Sea and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left the waters that are going to destroy the Egyptians are the same Waters that saved the Israelites are you receiving Revelation this evening I want you to see something here when God told Moses to go and speak and not to fear Moses did not fear he went straight to the Red Sea and he spoke he commanded it to to part and the Red Sea began parting and there the Bible says they appeared dry land dry land and I believe oh praise the Lord that's what God is making for us in this generation amen it is not good everywhere because Waters is a sign of the world the world is all over wherever we are it's not easy friends to live a Christian life it's not easy to be a true Christian in this world anymore it's not easy it's very difficult but let me tell you brother when you when you have a prophet amen of generation when you receive that Prophet what happens amen through the message of that Prophet God makes a way Hallelujah he makes a way for you and then you can be able to walk on that way thank God for the end time message thank God for the prophet of Our Generation because we have this message brother sister we can now walk on this path and we are walking on this path because we have the message this message hallelujah amen reveals the word of God to us and the Bible says the word amen shall be a lamp unto your feet what will it do it will guide your way it will lighten your path you will know where you are going you will see where you are going why because you have the word of God the revealed word of the hour amen will be the path amen will make a path of life for you in order for you to go through this life and all these trials and all his encumbrances and all his difficulties and all his hardships amen God makes a way for us to go through this life's journey and that's how the Israelites went through through all the Temptations hallelujah amen God told all those animals I don't care what they were maybe they were crocodiles he told them crocodiles step aside snakes step aside scorpions step aside I have my people I have that have called and they must cross over amen from Egypt they must cross over to the promised land and I tell you what God has a people in this generation and they must cross over from this world to the Rapture from this world over to Canan fa land we must cross over the devil cannot stop us we must cross over I don't know about you but I'm longing for the Rapture I don't know about you but I'm longing for a body change I'm longing for that day when we shall come out of here hallelujah we must cross over and as they were crossing over you know I want you to see this as they were crossing over you know the the the the the the the the sea made a path for them and they were walking through and when Pharaoh came and his captains Hallelujah he thought they will also go through this path Hallelujah is only for the cold this path is only for the seed of God he says it's a Highway to Heaven none can walk up there but the pure in hand it's a Highway to Heaven Walking Up The King's Highway amen none can walk up there but the pure in heart brother how is your heart how is your heart ask your neighbor how is the status of your heart how is your heart if your heart is not right with God you will not hear when he calls if your heart is not right with God you are just escorting us if your heart is not right with God you are a shark and and the prophet said the seed shall not be hair with a shark or the Shar shall not be here with the seed amen the seed is going to to be here to the promises of God the seed is going to go in Rapture but the shark is going to remain here on Earth the shark will not be able to go through and how do you know that you a shark if you have no desire for the things of God in your heart if your heart has no desire to live right with God if the word of God comes to you and you just brush it away instead of receiving it in your heart let me tell you you are risking to be a shark yes you may sit in the church you may sit under anointed preaching you may hear many pastors and many preachers and many evangelists but that will not change your heart a bit if you do not take heed to what you are hearing and do it and do it I've seen and had many people who will hear preacher preaching things and then they will go outside there and say do you think it is it is possible to do it it is not possible let me tell you you're risking to be a shark forgive me if I preach like an evangelist today I have an anointing of an evangelist this evening you must not be a shark you must be a seed and God is looking for seed those who shall receive his word those who have hearts amen that can receive and say Amen those amen who are doing wrong things and when they hear the word of God Amen coming and echoing in their ears they can say oh God forgive me baptize me with the baptism of the Holy Ghost God is looking for people who are ready to change what will you be and this time Pharaoh thought they will also come and walk on that way praise God he thought they would walk on that way and as they came with all the Chariots we already saw that him that bit before but the Bible says that a pill of fire went behind the the Israelites and God was defending them from behind and God was seeing his eyes through the pillar of fire and was looking at the Egyptians and that way he was defending the Israelites Hallelujah are you not so glad amen that God is here with us said God is in the camp with a bride God has not left us the pill of fire is still here the pill of fire is still with the bride you may not see it because it's right behind you he's watching your enemy he's watching our enemy Hallelujah and while he was watching the enemy what happened he destroyed their chariots he destroyed their chariots he destroyed all their power he destroyed all the their Warriors let me tell you we have the pill of fire here with us and it's destroying the Chariots of our enemies the pill of fire is here to fight for us because he said in the beginning the battle will not be yours hold still stand still and see the salvation of [Applause] God I don't care what the enemy will plan against me Hallelujah because I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and and the waters were separated and as they went through the waters something happened there something happened and as they went through God now told his servant Moses the prophet he said now Moses I want you to change position I want you now to turn and look at the waters stretch out your hand now over the sea Hallelujah that the waters May Come Again upon the Egyptians hallelujah hallelujah don't worry about all these little demons disturbing you brother sister Hallelujah because time is coming and Time Is Here time is coming and time is here when all those little demons of sickness when all those little demons of Temptations is going to come back again upon those who do not believe upon your enemies they're going to fight against one another they're going to kill each other that has been always the Strategic war that God has always fought for his own and we see here that as they as he stretched out his hand over the sea that the waters came again and destroyed all the Chariots and all the horsemen and Moses stretched forth his hand and uh Over the Sea and the Sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared and the Egyptians fled against it and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea did you hear that the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the Sea and the waters returned and covered the Chariots and the horsemen and all the the host of the Pharaoh of pharaoh that came in into the sea after them they remained not there remained not so much as one of them Hallelujah all the enemies we are seeing there will not remain even one of them when you cross over brother when we cross over sister did you know there won't be pain did you know there won't be Temptation did you know there won't be sickness did you know there won't be nothing like that why because we are crossing over to a land of milk and honey we are crossing over to a land where there will be no aging we are crossing over to a land where we are going to be Overcomers we are crossing over to a land where we are going to be more than conquerors we are crossing over nothing can stop us nothing can stop the Bride of Jesus Christ and I believe I'm one of them and we are right here warming up we are warming up to cross over we are warming up to cross over the devil cannot stop us come on Church shout amen the devil cannot stop us we are warming up for that great Hallelujah that great crossing over oh we are waiting for that day Hallelujah but while we are still here hallelujah do you know what we doing we are dancing over [Music] Devils while we are here on Earth hallelujah oh glory to God the Bible says amen when he lifted up his hand the waters came back again down and when the waters came back again down the waters swallowed all the Egyptians where was the bride where was the Believers they were on the other side they had crossed over what were they doing they were dancing they were singing they were dancing over Devils let me tell you this message has come so that we may dance over our demons dance over Devils dance over Devils why because we are more than conquerors my [Applause] sister Hallelujah the way of Escape has already been made the message of Moses created that way for Israel if they had decided to stay in one place the wrath of God would have consumed them too so in other words the message we have does not want us to stay in one place did you know that even God can bring a message even here right here in the church and if you just stay unmoved in one place no amen no standing up no Clapping Your Hands nothing nothing will happen to you and God will leave you and move over to the other ones who are you know receiving it and rejoicing and clapping and shouting why because they are not in one place Hallelujah but you find here that you see if these people God through Moses had made a way of escape and these people they did not stay in one place because Moses told them look come on now let's go go forward the order was given you cannot remain in one place when the word of God comes down amen this is spiritual but it is also physical when the word of God comes down to you don't stay the same come on receive it say Amen feel free to stand up and lift up your hand and do whatever it is shout why because you are receiving the word and when you do that what happens God moves in your life they did not stay in one place if they had stayed in one place the wrath of God would come upon them and would consume them too but they rain tell someone they ran they ran every one of them Hallelujah they ran they escaped the enemy was coming they escaped they read let us run we have a message let us run we have to run away from our enemy let us [Music] run Hallelujah when you enemy comes when your Temptation comes don't stay there run run that's why I love Joseph Joseph ran it was a temptation of fornication but Joseph said no I have to run brother sister run don't stay in one place the enemy will consume you let's look at Exodus chap 10 verse 25 where where are my deacons is there a deacon here praise the name of the Lord vers 25 and Moses said excuse me and Moses said thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may sacrifice unto the Lord Our God this is how Moses speaking to pharaoh before they crossed over our C also shall go with us there shall not an hoof be left behind Hallelujah for there must be a for thereof must we take to serve the Lord Our God and we know not with what we must serve the Lord until we come th now listen before you cross over you cannot know how to serve God you have to cross over from your Temptation you have to cross over from the the little Temptation that you're going through and go on the other side after you've made your decision after you've made your choice I'm going to serve the Lord then God will reveal to you how you will serve him otherwise you cannot serve him when you are still wallowing in the mud of sin there is no way you can serve God when you are still wallowing in the mud of sin lusts of the world and the pride of life and the last of the eyes you have to come out of it the Bible says come out of my people this message is to come out not to stay in but come out praise the name of the Lord come out and and I want you to see something here and Moses said thou must give us also sacrifices our bur offerings now when he realized he was going to go he said listen we must take our sacrifice first of all the king said you leave the children he said no I am not leaving the children behind even no little one is remaining behind follow me here closely now no little one is doing what hallelujah how many parents are here lift up your hands amen you need to say that with me no no little one is remaining behind amen and I'm speaking to you Brethren Hallelujah your children shall be saved your children shall come in the Rapture claim them every one of them none of them will stay in this L this year none of them will be lost if you claim them God gives them to you right now in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah he said we are going to take all of them none of them will stay and the devil was claiming them but but but Moses said no and this message has come to claim every little [Music] one our CLE also shall go with us hallelujah not only children but even cattle even cattle he says even our cattle shall go with us not only our CLE but even their Hooves oh my God meaning Satan you are remaining with nothing whatever belongs to us we are taking it with us whatever is ours we are taking it with us

the Rapture every bit of Hallelujah and if you have a you have a loved one who is unsaved tonight begin to claim them right now say every one of them is coming into the Rapture if you claim them you apply the token of the blood they too shall be saved they too shall be saved somebody ought say hallelujah to thatu Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord we have to escape for our life he says all of them Must Escape we don't know how we are going to serve God but we will know when we get over the other side and I want you to see the wrath of God is coming friends that the wrath of God is coming and this is the most terrible thing and I want to tell it to you tonight Malachi ch 4: 1-3 it says for Behold a day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yeah and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayth the Lord of hosts that he shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and he shall go forth and grow up as carves of the stall and shall trade down the wicked for there shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts amen they used to they used to give handkerchiefs and take it out of the body of Paul and I remember there was one time in Ethiopia a brother came and gave me a handkerchief it was my hand cief I was using it in the service and he said brother Pastor let me take this hand cief from you and and uh he said did miracles for him I did not claim that he did but he said so well I need a handkerchief someone wants to get a handkerchief out of my body you can donate yours to me tonight praise the Lord Malachi 4:1 it says for Behold a day cometh that shall burn as an offen and all the proud yeah and all that do wickedly shall be stable and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of host that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch now friends I want you to be careful and listen to this carefully it says but unto you that fear my name shall the son of of righteousness are you hearing arise with what with what in what in his wings and do what ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stor and he shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of o and before Moses and his team went out before he went out the waters were all up and they had made a way in the middle there but the moment they went through he said now you can let the waters come down and destroyed all the Egyptians the only thing holding the Judgment of God is the Bride of Jesus Christ being down here the moment the Body of Christ lives this Earth friends it is going to be chaos to you believer who is playing around you are in the church but you are playing around God is seeing you the angel of the Lord is seeing you and time is coming when the bride has left you will face the music you don't have to right now before that time arrives you can put your life right and live like a real Christian because the Bible says here Behold a day cometh and that day shall what burn as an oven and all the proud all that do wickedly shall be stubble and a day shall burn them up sayith the Lord of hosts he shall leave them neither root nor branch in the days of Noah it was fire everybody say it was fire in the days of lot what happened it was two cities fire two cities in the days of Noah it was water in the days of lot it was fire and we see in our day the whole world is going to be consumed by what fire so fire is coming tell your neighbor fire is coming if we don't preach this then we not preaching the message are you following me this is the message the message is not all God loves you you are going to go to heaven don't you worry about what you are doing God the blood will cover no problem no problem God loves you you a very good person what what what that is not going to help here if I don't if I don't if I preach the other and I don't preach this then I'm not preaching the message to you uhhuh the anointing is coming to you brother God bless you ah you give me a double portion may you receive a double portion this evening hallelujah praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah I want you to see this clearly friends because if I don't preach this to you I would be a liar and I will not be telling you the truth this part of the Gospel is the gospel fire is coming and fire is coming it is the truth fire is coming and fire is coming it is going to burn all that do wickedly it is going to burn the unrepentant it is going to burn the fornicators it's going to burn the the adulterers it's going to burn the drunkers it's going to burn and all those that are amen and do not fear in the word of God the extortioners fire is coming the Bible says the day is coming that shall burn as an oven but he says unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings how did that sun arise the sun has already risen in our day by the end time message of Malachi 4 the enti message is the son of righteousness that has come down to us to redeem us out of the L but what is God waiting for in our day he's going to destroy the whole world with fire but he's waiting for the cup of iniquity to be filled for the last one to come in Hallelujah we preach Hell Fire we preach the Holy Ghost we preach Grace we preach love praise God and this is the truth it's the truth tell your neighbor it is the truth if you're still there playing with lies you have a lying tongue I want to remind you this evening fire is coming if you are still cheating fire is coming and that fire is going to burn you if you don't repent being that we have received grace through this message it does not mean we don't have repentance anymore we still believe in Repentance we still believe in Holiness we still believe in righteousness we still believe in every part of the word we still believing in young men and young ladies being clean serving God seeking for the Holy Ghost praying if it means it all night praying seeking after the Holy Ghost because when that fire comes it will burn them up but thank God for the light that has shined in our day because it is calling us out of those things this is what this message is meant for let me tell you serving God is not easy serving God is a sacrifice many of us have sacrificed a lot of things and even the lives you wanted to live you have to sacrifice if you are making a choice to serve God you have to sacrifice you have to leave some things and leave it decide to leave it make up your mind to leave it nobody is going to do that choice for you you have to make the choice to serve God when you still can if you don't make that choice now now you will not make it when you are dead the moment you are dead you have no power to make that choice you have the power now when you are alive and when you have control over your thought over your heart over your mind over your mouth and then you can make that choice and make up your mind and it doesn't matter even you who were born by Believers and even to you my children especially you Elizabeth and shba where is she you think that your father is a person you are going to go to heaven you will not go to heaven because I'm your I'm your father you you have to go to Heaven by receiving Jesus Christ and by being filled with the Holy Ghost other than that you are going to hell and unless you repent every one of us has to repent every one of us has to come and find Jesus Christ by a conviction every one of us has to escape friends I remember when they were running amen going through the waters everyone the little ones the big ones the fathers the mothers all of them have to escape for their life you all have to escape for your life no one can save you but yourself the word has been given but you have to realize it you have to accept it you have to come to that place where you say I know God I love God I'm going to serve God with all my life the word has been given the only thing that is left now is the judgments of God but you see the Lord is waiting for for the cup of iniquity to be filled and for the last one to come in when the sins of the people increase God Is Watching God is seeing all the Sinners and if you here and you are one of them don't leave this church before you repenting because it may be your last time to ever be in church it may be your last time if you were Sinner and you are here it may be your last time don't leave before you repent don't leave before you put your life right who knows maybe the Rapture will happen the next minute or maybe you will die before you ever come back again make sure that your life is right with God and that you are walking right with God and that you know if he calls you now or if he comes now you are fit to go you are ready to go oh that's my desire and I I have only five minutes left so I just read a quote for you here H in the book of in the in the message the Easter seal and and as a song said we are seeking out that little lost sheep that that won't he won't come until that ship is in he won't come until that ship is in everyone has to be in in the fold he won't close the door until that last one is in so Minister Brothers I am sure with you this morning of trying to hunt out that leadership it might be in Phoenix or here in nongo today this morning or this evening I don't know but when the last last one comes in then the shepherd will close the door you see it it may be you you may be the last sheep here today until you come in then the door will not be closed that's why we now talk about the love of God he's waiting for you to come in but remember time is running and running fast time is running time is running out make up your mind you're not going to go because the pastor is your friend or because you talk well with him or because listen when I'm out there and talking to you I'm your friend I'm all that but still doesn't take away the fact that Hell Fire is there and that God is going to bur those ones who have not made up their mind and have received the Holy Ghost make sure who you are and where you are and where you standing in the word of God Luke 17:32 he says remember Lord's wife whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life and shall sa preserve it and I tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other shall be left two men shall be in the field one shall be taken and the other shall be left now and he says remember Lord is Lord's wife why do we remember Lot's wife because in Genesis 19:22 God spoke to lot and he told him lot Hast you H be first hen hasten rather be first Escape fif escape the angel of the Lord came down with a message of Escape come on Lord escape with your family escape with your mother escape with your wife with your children Escape for I cannot do anything till thou become th therefore the name of the city was called Z now listen we have already seen our prophet telling us God will not come unless the last one is in right and he the angel told lot I will not destroy the city until you are what you are out of the city but that did not stop God from making Lord's wife a pillar of salt Lord's wife was the last one right maybe she was the last one that they were waiting for and when she came out then Hellfire came down upon upon gomor and Sodom but after she came out she looked back and when she looked back she became a pillar of salt and listen to me church if you look back in the things you came back from you will become a pillar of salt if you look back to the world you will become a pill of salt don't desire those things of the world they are rotten to the core desire the word of God desire the Holy Ghost desire to be right with God or else if you desire the world you will become a pillar of salt and after coming out of Sodom yet she was ruined and lost just right on the mountain there and until today she's there a pillar of salt she did not make it oh God have mercy God have mercy friends don't look back I say Escape for your life don't look back Genesis 19:23 the sun was risen upon the earth when Lord entered into his Z then the Lord reigned upon Sodom and gomorra brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven and he overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants in in of the cities and that which grew upon the ground but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pill of salt what will you become sister you may become a pill of salt take heed run I said run for your life brother run for your life sister Escape we don't have much time left and I read here in the mess tting for life please give me like five more minutes listening when that animal is grabbed that little deer and the W would shake it now if the deer's real smart if you have ever watched it the deer could twist real quick and jump where sideways and if the wolf hasn't got too deep a hold it will Jack a big handful out or big mouthful rather out of the little deer's flank then when then what must the little deer do he's talking about the wolf having caught the deer and put his teeth in his body and the deer is trying to fight and fight and fight and when it fights out then the the wolf would just go off over the deer's flesh taking a little piece then what must the little dear do after that while the Wolves is are tumbling and rolling with the with with this mouthful of Flesh the blood begins to spot and when it does the deer got to run for what is in it everything run and oh God if there ever was a time that women and men ought to run tonight run for your life run dear friend run for your life that's the message I have for you today run for your life and he says in the message just once more as I finish oh Pentecost Pentecost run for your life there is just a little time left it's later than you think if this was 1963 how much more now

repentance will do you nothing when you have an opportunity like this it's a golden [Music] opportunity and to you who don't mind about what I'm saying when the time reaches you you will hear these words again for sure a prophet would say when he was going down to Hell as the Lord allowed him to go there so he can see what is there he had voices of those people there crying out but their crying out was in vain and it says as they go down they they hear the voices those people hear the voices of all the preachers that have ever preached to them those voices come back echoing back in their ears but all for nothing just for judgment but to you today all the voices you've ever heard minister to you in your heart it's a voice of God to you to save you not to judge you and you only have that chance to receive the salvation and grace of God when you are here on Earth and say Lord I want to surrender myself to you wholeheartedly in this year Lord as we start this year I want to just begin on a clean slate and that will can only happen Lord if you change me change my heart oh God let me be new fill me with your spirit and let me serve you with all my [Music] heart to you who think I'm taking [Music] time when that day arrives you will surely know that this was nothing spending only 1 hour two 3 hours in his presence you will know it was worth it even wor worth more than anything else you could be doing instead of being here in the house of [Music] God and to others who think we're just wasting time and we're being fools they will surely know when it is too late when the time has run out on them and they have nowhere to run you're privileged that you can be here in the house of God today to seek after him and to let to prepare yourself and your life before him that he will fill you with the Holy Ghost and burn out all the world away out of your life all the desires of the world and just remove it out of you and fill you with the Holy Ghost and give you power to live a Christian Life he still does that when you have reached a place and your back is against the wall you have nowhere to run I say run to him Escape for your life [Music] Lord [Music] Jesus we desire that when that day comes which could be tonight or tomorrow night or tomorrow morning or it could even be the next hour we do not know but we know that the Rapture is real and your word is real and this Bible is not a myth or a story book it's a [Music] reality father we don't want to be left behind I don't want to be left behind Lord want to be numbered among those that are going in the Rapture cleanse me oh Father Make Me mold me and do that to every person that has been listening to me today mold a character of Jesus Christ within them some of them perhaps do not know how to do it lord they're confused if only you can touch them Father you can make them whole again and give them the real desire of the things of God again in their heart that they will seek after you it has come to a Time Lord when there are no more people listening and crying out to you father but Lord here we have a a people father that are crying out Desiring for more of you father Desiring for a change within Desiring that they will be more like you oh God granted Lord that you'll give us your presence not only your presence but your life within us and if there be any sinner here father that will come to repentance convict them of sin and may they not rest May these words that they have heard today haunt them until they come to repentance if they have not yet come to eat Lord maybe a
