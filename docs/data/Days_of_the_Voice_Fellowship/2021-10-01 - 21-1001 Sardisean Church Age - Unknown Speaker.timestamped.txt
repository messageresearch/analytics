[16:09] god bless you wealth god bless you
[16:11] whereas god bless you bless you
[16:14] what about you
[16:16] no
[16:17] you are already finished is there anyone
[16:20] who i had promised a gift and they never
[16:21] got their gift
[16:25] no one all of you got a gift but no one

[16:29] that's right
[16:31] you don't want to thank but you have to
[16:32] receive
[16:34] all right but was there ever got their
[16:36] gifts
[16:37] it was just a token to
[16:39] encourage you to continue
[16:42] in the word of god
[16:43] that's a gift from me but
[16:45] god wants us to give you his own gift
[16:48] gift of the word ghost
[16:50] this is what you desire to be able to
[16:52] get
[16:53] amen amen that's the reason why we are
[16:56] starting all these things to get to know
[16:57] him because that was not him his life
[16:59] not only to know him as in knowing the
[17:02] knowledge but to also not give me the
[17:03] power of his resurrection
[17:06] um
[17:07] so today we have to begin in the
[17:08] suggestion
[17:09] charge age
[17:11] and this is a which number which age is
[17:14] it
[17:20] so i'm sure that you have enjoyed all
[17:22] the rest
[17:23] now as we are starting here i'd like
[17:25] someone here two people or three to tell
[17:28] me what was the most outstanding thing
[17:30] they have gotten they have got they have
[17:32] been able to get from the rest from the
[17:34] previous chapters we have covered with
[17:36] the church
[17:37] what was the things that really stood
[17:40] out for them that they have been able to
[17:41] capture they have been able to get
[17:43] anybody here
[17:47] i want two three people
[17:49] metroid is very outstanding
[17:51] all right but the joy one money this
[17:55] okay so
[17:57] uh
[18:01] all right
[18:03] sister over there sister
[18:05] [Music]
[18:09] go ahead
[18:12] [Music]
[18:22] [Music]
[18:26] hey man so what is sabbath
[18:36] and the virgos will seal you
[18:39] and then you will have your
[18:52] and
[18:53] so when does a man rest
[18:57] someone rests when he rests from his wax
[19:00] not so
[19:01] so
[19:02] when does a man rest from his wax
[19:05] according to the sabbatarians brother
[19:07] calls them that it's about sanitarians
[19:10] those of us who just keeps up a day
[19:13] those are italians or sanitarians
[19:15] whatever it is according to them a man
[19:18] rests from his wax when he stops cooking
[19:21] when he stops washing clothes when they
[19:23] stopped saying you know whatever it is
[19:25] that they were doing uh going to job and
[19:27] then they rest
[19:29] and they're going in their temples or
[19:31] their churches they'd be there according
[19:34] to them the rest
[19:35] and that's the day this day for them in
[19:37] a week they rest only
[19:39] one day
[19:41] but for the believers of this precious
[19:43] message
[19:44] we have known
[19:46] that we rest from our works
[19:49] one time forever hallelujah
[19:52] we don't need to rest keep resting every
[19:54] week keep resting everybody keep resting
[19:56] no why
[19:58] whoa listen this is so beautiful
[20:00] when jesus christ
[20:02] before jesus quest came the jews were
[20:05] entering into
[20:08] the the the holy place but they could
[20:10] not enter into the holy
[20:12] of
[20:12] holies why because the world of warriors
[20:16] was where the shekinah glory was
[20:19] was where the presence of god was was
[20:21] where god himself was
[20:23] but
[20:24] in there the high priest would enter
[20:26] into that place only once
[20:29] every
[20:30] year
[20:31] every
[20:32] year and he would enter in after he has
[20:35] been sprinkled with blood
[20:37] but that plant was the blood of bulls
[20:39] and gods
[20:41] so it had to be and also that thing that
[20:44] process was a continuous process
[20:46] because our blood was not permanent
[20:49] amen
[20:51] but when jesus christ came and he died
[20:53] on the cross
[20:55] those walls of the world between the one
[20:57] place and the holy one is broke
[21:00] those words broke
[21:03] meaning there was now a permanent
[21:05] entrance
[21:07] amen ushered or opened now for everyone
[21:10] who is willing to enter in there not
[21:12] only the high priest now
[21:14] all of us now became priests
[21:16] and we would be able to enter there
[21:18] because our high priest jesus christ the
[21:21] lamb now that takes away the sins of the
[21:23] world once and for all
[21:25] one time forever he had entered in there
[21:28] into the holy of what is hallelujah and
[21:30] he was able to get life for each and
[21:31] every one of us he said i am the way the
[21:33] truth and the life and he said that
[21:34] whosoever comes to me
[21:36] he will get what he'll get life he has
[21:39] left you know now we notice that jesus
[21:41] christ when he entered in there when he
[21:43] died his death on the cross
[21:45] was what actually answered him in there
[21:47] and after all of us together with him
[21:50] hallelujah
[21:52] for us our summer's rest
[21:55] is not keeping over sudden death
[21:57] sunday
[21:58] or saturday some people think that now
[22:01] we don't get saturday we keep standing
[22:03] sunday is not our summer's rest
[22:05] just like saturday is not our it's about
[22:08] blessed
[22:09] our summer to rest when we rest from our
[22:11] works
[22:12] what what the works of the flesh the
[22:15] bible the book of galatians 3 he says
[22:17] the words of the flesh are manifest and
[22:19] these are number one
[22:22] envy adultery continue
[22:26] yes idolatry
[22:28] strike yes
[22:30] come on now
[22:32] lasciviousness yes
[22:35] malice yes
[22:37] consciousness yes
[22:39] oh those are the words of what
[22:42] anger fruits of anger whatever it is
[22:44] those are what's of the flesh
[22:46] lust those are what's of that flesh now
[22:49] the moment you receive the holy ghost
[22:51] however because when jesus died on the
[22:53] cross
[22:54] he went to the grave and when he went to
[22:57] the grave he came out of the grave and
[22:59] when he came out of the grave he went to
[23:01] heaven and when he went to heaven he
[23:03] came back down again in the form of the
[23:05] holy ghost
[23:21] things that you used to do that's why we
[23:22] sing at some of the things i used to do
[23:24] i do them no more there are fun our
[23:26] sabbath rest is receiving the holy ghost
[23:29] because when you see the holy ghost you
[23:30] have rested from your what the words
[23:32] that we're talking about here are the
[23:33] human works of the flesh
[23:36] and then we begin to do the works of
[23:37] their spirit or the
[23:40] works of the spirit which is now
[23:41] something else which is not
[23:43] those of the flesh the bible also says
[23:45] the words of the
[23:46] spirit
[23:47] are manifest and these are
[23:51] love
[23:52] patience
[23:53] joy
[23:56] faith
[23:57] goodness
[23:59] kindness
[24:03] speak loudly
[24:06] some of you are just saying things that
[24:08] you don't know you must say what you
[24:09] know all right come on
[24:12] nicknames
[24:13] patience these are the works of the work
[24:16] of the flesh of the spirit blood of the
[24:18] flesh right because of the spirit when
[24:21] you when you you rest from the others
[24:23] you begin doing other words
[24:25] some people try to do these words when
[24:26] they don't have the holy spirit
[24:28] you cannot you are just trying to be a
[24:29] hypocrite
[24:31] when you try to make you
[24:33] make yourself do it you can never do it
[24:35] properly and also when you do it you
[24:37] cannot be good because you'll be a
[24:39] hypocrite you will be doing it and doing
[24:41] the other one you have to receive the
[24:43] holy spirit and then you will do it
[24:45] automatically
[24:46] hallelujah
[24:47] amen why are you doing the why you
[24:49] behaving the way you behave because that
[24:50] is you so when you receive the holy
[24:52] spirit in you you will behave the way
[24:53] the holy spirit behaves it is natural
[24:56] hallelujah so it's not forced it's not a
[24:59] work of affliction it's the work of the
[25:00] spirit in you christ in you living the
[25:03] life that he has he lived when he was on
[25:05] earth
[25:06] so that was a very good outstanding
[25:08] something that you learned from the
[25:10] church
[25:11] so far
[25:12] and we covered that yes and it was so
[25:14] amazing to find out that many thought
[25:15] that it was sunday other saturday but
[25:17] it's neither of those days
[25:19] it is made up of this and now so someone
[25:21] may ask why do we now fellowship on
[25:24] sunday
[25:27] we fellowship on sunday
[25:29] because
[25:31] sunday
[25:32] is the day
[25:34] that jesus christ rose again from the
[25:35] grave
[25:38] and jesus when he rose from the grave
[25:40] where did he go the first place he went
[25:42] to
[25:43] was where the disciples were gathered
[25:45] all of them were gathered together in
[25:48] here
[25:49] and why were they gathered they were
[25:51] gathered in that place
[25:53] in fear trying to plan what they should
[25:55] do next
[25:56] and then jesus christ came and he
[25:58] appeared before them
[26:00] and since that time the believers have
[26:02] continued together that same day in
[26:04] commemoration of the resurrection of our
[26:06] lord jesus christ
[26:08] every
[26:09] first day of the week we were gathering
[26:12] so that's the reason why we also
[26:13] contribute because we are following what
[26:15] the apostolate actually is doing
[26:17] but it is not like a norm or a mask you
[26:19] can also gather on
[26:21] saturday but we
[26:24] we really respect sunday as the
[26:26] christians because that was the day our
[26:28] lord rose from the dead
[26:30] that's why if you are a true christian
[26:32] you cannot stay at home on sunday you
[26:35] cannot
[26:37] you cannot
[26:38] that's why some people call it the lord
[26:40] this day
[26:41] why because it was the day when he rose
[26:44] from the dead
[26:45] in the morning
[26:47] you cannot go to your workout instead of
[26:48] going through to the house of god
[26:50] even when you are very far from the
[26:52] church you can at this stream if you
[26:54] can't stream at least you will walk and
[26:56] find another even if it's happening with
[26:57] something you attend there
[26:59] you have to go there
[27:01] on a day like that
[27:02] and worship god because that's when the
[27:04] delivers god to remember the
[27:07] resurrection of jesus christ
[27:08] hallelujah
[27:10] amen
[27:11] god bless you
[27:13] all right you let me pick your brother
[27:15] now
[27:18] okay
[27:21] you are you you're down i should be
[27:23] again all right
[27:26] okay
[27:28] right yeah what i learned from this
[27:31] search engine
[27:32] uh we learned tonight
[27:35] not not the world started because we
[27:36] have not completed yet yes but you from
[27:39] what we have covered
[27:40] so far yes
[27:44] apostolic church
[28:01] they preach the gospel a true word
[28:03] and the manifestation of the gift of the
[28:06] holy spirit
[28:07] and we learned that the true gospel is
[28:09] not only the word
[28:10] but it's it's both the word and the
[28:13] manifestation of the power
[28:16] amen
[28:17] hallelujah that's quite a very very
[28:20] outstanding thing for us to be able to
[28:21] learn from this
[28:24] from this study
[28:25] that the true church the first point you
[28:28] said
[28:30] the true church of god
[28:33] yes what is our pattern
[28:36] what is the true church of god pattern
[28:37] the after
[28:40] what can we say that this is our
[28:41] foundation we are back we are pattern
[28:46] we are patterned after that
[28:49] we are patterned we must be attacked
[28:51] after the first church
[28:53] at the usually
[28:57] what was the first started derivam like
[29:00] on the day of pentecost
[29:02] what was it like
[29:03] it had two things
[29:06] number one
[29:07] it had the true word of
[29:10] god and number two
[29:14] that richard had the true
[29:17] manifestation
[29:19] of the power
[29:20] of god
[29:22] in science and
[29:25] and in davis manifestations of the
[29:28] spirit
[29:30] even if that church claims to preach
[29:32] their word but when they do not have any
[29:34] manifestation among them
[29:37] we learned that that's not the truth
[29:40] that jesus
[29:42] even if that church has the true
[29:43] manifest seems which would be like the
[29:45] true manifestation but has not pure word
[29:47] of god we land that's not the truth
[29:51] that's it because we also saw there is a
[29:53] first vibe and ah
[29:55] a true vine
[29:57] the first vine is that one which claims
[30:00] to be the true vine but actually it does
[30:03] not have the characteristics of the true
[30:05] vine
[30:07] the true vine has two characteristics
[30:09] and it should always work side by side
[30:12] together
[30:13] the first one is the pure word of god
[30:16] it must teach what
[30:18] the bible says everything that is in
[30:21] here everything the apostles taught
[30:23] whether it's small
[30:24] or
[30:25] big
[30:27] that church must believe it
[30:29] hallelujah
[30:31] whether it is women modesty how they
[30:33] should
[30:34] treat themselves how they should redress
[30:36] it seems small they benefit says that
[30:39] that is not concerned
[30:40] the true church of god all through the
[30:42] edges will stick with what the apostles
[30:44] taught hallelujah
[30:46] whether it is about children baptism
[30:48] they will not accept it they will say
[30:51] baptism for others
[30:53] who can hear
[30:55] believe and confess
[30:58] they must also believe baptism in the
[31:00] name of our lord jesus christ
[31:02] that true church
[31:04] must teach everything the apostles
[31:07] should have glass
[31:08] they must believe
[31:10] god for the manifestation of his spirit
[31:13] among them
[31:16] in science and diverse manifestations
[31:18] when i said i was masters i mean many
[31:20] manifestations for example
[31:24] come on we're in a bible study
[31:28] times interpretation yes
[31:30] healing yes
[31:35] prophecies yes designment of spirit yes
[31:40] this gifts of wisdom yes
[31:44] of knowledge yes
[31:46] give some helps
[31:49] yeah that's a gift too
[31:51] and others look all these gifts must be
[31:54] in the body hallelujah
[31:57] that church must be
[31:58] alive no man's church
[32:01] it must be alive people who are alive
[32:03] even when you see when you see a tree
[32:05] which is alive how does it behave
[32:09] it is like it is all the time worshiping
[32:12] hallelujah
[32:13] that church must have received that full
[32:15] restoration of worship
[32:17] not just the staggering and the dormant
[32:19] and looking dead because we are restored
[32:22] today through teachings and then as long
[32:25] as we receive these two teachings you
[32:27] are going into rapture when you are no
[32:30] having no life at all
[32:31] if your religion has no life but it will
[32:34] give you one with life
[32:35] therefore this message came to
[32:37] make us bury our religion to that life
[32:39] and give us one with life this message
[32:41] must have life
[32:43] when you are sending your soul you must
[32:45] have life
[32:46] not just saying just saying like we used
[32:48] to sing in the nomination some of you
[32:49] would not even go in those denominations
[32:51] you would be there we stand stand up
[32:56] [Music]
[33:09] jesus left hallelujah he left a church
[33:11] that has a life in it
[33:14] amen if you're going to sing that song
[33:16] you sing it with life
[33:22] this
[33:33] he said these men are not drunk with
[33:35] alcohol but they are drunk
[33:45] they don't like it but the true child
[33:47] will love it that's one thing we learned
[33:49] you see this in this study has been so
[33:52] good for us
[33:54] to learn all these things what else
[33:58] someone else yes
[34:18] when you dress
[34:24] right
[34:34] hallelujah
[34:35] we land hallelujah
[34:38] that you are what don't save you
[34:41] now we have a religion
[34:44] we call it them legalists that believe
[34:46] that your works save you that when you
[34:48] do
[34:49] good works you've got to believe the
[34:50] muslims believe that do you know that
[34:53] the muslims believe if you do good
[34:54] things according to their religion you
[34:56] go to jannah
[34:58] and you know you marry up for wives you
[35:01] love them equally
[35:03] you take care of them equally
[35:05] and then also you kill these
[35:07] non-believers
[35:09] and then also you do those kind of
[35:10] things that
[35:12] are good you know you don't treat others
[35:15] and things like that
[35:17] then you will go to dinner
[35:20] even in christianity some people teach
[35:22] those kind of things
[35:23] that if you do good works if you dress
[35:26] well
[35:28] if you don't fornicate
[35:30] you don't commit adultery you don't
[35:32] smoke
[35:33] you don't drink you don't wear jewelry
[35:37] you don't uh
[35:38] you know cut your hair as a sister you
[35:40] don't uh you know you younger men you
[35:42] don't go to this alcohol and drink and
[35:45] you know you don't do these things
[35:48] you will see god
[35:50] you are going in heaven
[35:53] so they start doing those things so that
[35:54] they can be able to bribe god to go to
[35:56] heaven
[35:58] if you are like that
[36:00] then you do not understand that when you
[36:01] are studying
[36:03] none of us will ever do those things to
[36:05] go to living if you are one among them
[36:08] just know you are not you are understood
[36:12] to christianity is not the things that
[36:15] you do
[36:17] but also we found out that we go to
[36:19] heaven by our faith
[36:23] hallelujah
[36:24] now some people think faith
[36:27] you just believe
[36:29] and you know
[36:30] do
[36:32] you understand
[36:34] they say you just believe believe bill
[36:36] jesus rose from the dead i believe you
[36:38] believe
[36:48] do you do i don't care to do i just
[36:50] believe
[36:51] you believe in being one i believe you
[36:54] can you wear me no problem
[36:56] can you
[36:58] you know cut your hair sister no problem
[37:00] what i believe
[37:01] you see that kind of
[37:03] they think that when you believe you
[37:04] believe you believe it is what is in
[37:05] your heart but what is outside but we
[37:08] have found out in our study
[37:11] that actually
[37:13] that your faith serves you
[37:16] and that your faith is manifested in
[37:18] your works
[37:20] it is your words that you do by faith
[37:23] that will take you to heaven
[37:26] hallelujah
[37:28] it is not your works but it is your
[37:30] works that are manufactured out of faith
[37:34] john what was it james say
[37:37] show me your faith without your words
[37:39] and i will show you
[37:41] my faith by what
[37:43] by my works
[37:46] then we learn no matter what you say you
[37:49] are we see you by what you do
[37:52] even if you say look at me i am a man of
[37:54] the tree but you have
[37:56] onions from you which i'll just laugh at
[37:58] you
[38:01] look at me i'm orange but you have a lot
[38:03] of what
[38:04] lemons on you you just wasting time
[38:09] it's not what you do
[38:11] is what you are
[38:14] and what you are is what you will
[38:16] manifest hallelujah
[38:19] therefore what we have learned that
[38:20] works and faith go on in hand
[38:23] you only do what you are
[38:26] someone say that it's not what you dress
[38:28] it is what uh
[38:29] you believe and then i said okay
[38:32] that your heart depends on the nature of
[38:34] your heart then i said all right based
[38:36] on the nature of your heart what type of
[38:38] heart takes you to wear a mini skirt
[38:41] what type of hair takes you to a shop to
[38:42] buy a trouser when you're a woman what
[38:44] type of heart is that one you think
[38:46] that's that kind of art will go to
[38:47] heaven
[38:48] it is so lustful
[38:51] that loves the things of the world
[38:53] a heart that is a savior a heart that
[38:55] loves a man to be sexy to be appealing
[38:58] to men so that you can draw very many of
[39:00] them to help because jesus himself said
[39:02] that a man that will look at a woman to
[39:05] lust after her not the other way around
[39:09] a man that will look at a woman
[39:11] to rush after her he have already
[39:13] committed adultery but why would it be
[39:16] to rule
[39:18] why because jesus knew that the devil is
[39:20] using the sense of vision
[39:23] see when you see
[39:25] then you see
[39:27] you see that is good
[39:29] you you are you are taken away you are
[39:32] you are enticed
[39:34] you know the bible says that no man
[39:36] no but no man that good terms but a man
[39:39] is tempted by his own
[39:41] last
[39:43] and when lust is conceived then what
[39:45] happens
[39:47] it brings forth
[39:49] see and when sin has finished with you
[39:52] what does it bring
[39:53] it brings forth death so that's the
[39:55] process there are five jesus tries to
[39:58] help us to cut that process by saying
[40:01] your eyes should be covered
[40:04] hallelujah
[40:05] then we see that our works that we do
[40:08] are only a manifestation of what we
[40:10] believe
[40:11] it's a manifestation of our faith that
[40:13] one we see in the message
[40:15] then after people begin to tell you out
[40:16] there why do you do this don't even
[40:18] force them to do those things when they
[40:20] are not believers it's just like forcing
[40:22] a
[40:23] bee to really clean itself up and
[40:25] perfume itself
[40:26] you know
[40:28] some some of you have very wrong
[40:29] approach you find people there they are
[40:31] wearing their trousers they are not
[40:32] believers and you begin judging them
[40:34] surely we believe that you don't judge
[40:36] me
[40:50] your body now in your mouth that thing
[40:52] is that you because you stay on the ones
[40:54] the pig will look at it
[40:58] okay so so that the people think you
[41:01] have a problem but actually the problem
[41:03] is for both with both of you because
[41:07] you are saying the right thing but you
[41:08] are sending it to a longer person in a
[41:10] longer place
[41:12] so
[41:13] when god is calling us he doesn't tell
[41:15] us to do things we don't know to do he
[41:17] tells us come
[41:19] hallelujah you know so when you
[41:21] minister to those people don't
[41:23] immediately go and start talking about
[41:25] the addressing you know don't
[41:27] immediately go and begin to conduct them
[41:29] and tell them you're going to hell no
[41:30] that's not christianity that's not the
[41:32] gospel
[41:33] the gospel is good news so when you go
[41:35] to these people tell them about
[41:36] salvation how they will talk to their
[41:39] soul usually that's what i do that's why
[41:40] when i whenever i go out there i baptize
[41:42] people why because when i preach the
[41:44] gospel
[41:46] to the new people especially i don't i
[41:48] endeavor to touch their soul
[41:50] that's the purpose you touch you make
[41:52] the person feel that they need something
[41:54] they don't have
[41:55] but if someone thinks you are just there
[41:57] to judge him and cut cut him to pieces
[41:59] and put him in the fire he will say ah
[42:01] even if you have to come there maybe you
[42:03] will got to go finish me completely but
[42:05] let them know that they need something
[42:09] that you have something they don't have
[42:11] make them realize that there is
[42:12] something they need to have amen preach
[42:15] them christ tell them about salvation
[42:17] tell them about how he died for them
[42:19] tell them about the resurrection of
[42:21] the world turn over the name of jesus
[42:23] and how powerful the name of jesus is
[42:26] ask them whether they have been baptized
[42:28] in that name
[42:29] tell them about god tell them about you
[42:31] know when they realize that they will
[42:33] come
[42:35] actually one of them came satan said i
[42:37] realize every one of the women i notice
[42:39] they don't wear trousers
[42:42] is it a doctrine here i was like oh
[42:45] that's now a good time now sit down
[42:47] since i tell you hallelujah then you
[42:50] pull up
[42:51] the scriptures
[42:54] i don't even explain i just read this
[42:57] okay that's why we do that
[43:00] next sunday you will find out also
[43:02] coming with a dress
[43:03] and that will be the end of trousers
[43:05] amen
[43:08] let us let the preach the gospel of
[43:09] words let us preach the gospel of faith
[43:13] the gospel that makes men to repent of
[43:16] their sins the gospel that
[43:18] makes men to realize that they need
[43:20] something that you have
[43:22] and when they come let them notice that
[43:25] christ
[43:26] can change them hallelujah and of course
[43:29] when you find a ship
[43:31] in the big wallows
[43:33] it has a problem it is sick
[43:36] and when you pick it out and wash it it
[43:38] will not go back but if you pick that
[43:40] big it will just go back because
[43:42] it's a big beginning you understand
[43:45] so
[43:46] we don't know what sometimes we go
[43:47] collect people watch them but sometimes
[43:51] they go back you know
[43:53] it just shows who they are but if you're
[43:55] a child of god you can't come back you
[43:57] can't come but you're gonna listen but
[43:59] you can't find peace there
[44:01] until you run back and say oh lord i
[44:03] don't belong there i'm sorry for all the
[44:04] things i've done because you're a seed
[44:06] of god
[44:08] that was a good one i have someone else
[44:12] you were raising up your hand
[44:15] oh that was from us all right someone
[44:17] else here was raising up there and goes
[44:18] did you bother
[44:31] is
[44:44] it doesn't matter what name you have on
[44:47] your door
[44:48] it is about what is inside there some
[44:52] people think that
[44:53] you believe
[44:54] the prophet yes
[44:55] you believe that the message
[44:57] is fulfilled yes you believe
[45:01] no problem
[45:02] who told you who told you many of them
[45:05] are not even going to go
[45:07] none of them are not going to go
[45:08] hallelujah
[45:10] the setups are not what they say
[45:13] it is not what they say they are it is
[45:15] what they really are
[45:29] yeah
[45:31] but
[45:31] increase your volume voice
[45:34] what i've learned is that
[45:38] even in the days of
[45:40] the old testament
[46:12] now separated
[46:22] and in a more clear way we can
[46:24] understand what to say
[46:28] that
[46:29] as we we studied in the church stages
[46:35] see that
[46:36] the trick the devil uses
[46:54] yes
[46:58] yes
[47:01] amen
[47:02] have you heard that
[47:04] that is the way the devil got eve
[47:07] and asked where the devil will get
[47:08] anyone even today
[47:10] the moment he makes without the word
[47:16] he has already got you in his hands
[47:19] but thank god that they
[47:21] believe us a true believer believes that
[47:24] no matter the situation around them they
[47:25] believe that what
[47:27] hallelujah
[47:28] you believe
[47:30] abraham believed that he was counted up
[47:32] to him for righteousness
[47:34] and the rest believe others would
[47:36] believe that's how they were counted to
[47:38] be righteous
[47:40] because they believed
[47:42] not even writers but righteousness was
[47:46] what was given to them
[47:48] because they believed the word so you
[47:50] must always believe the world regardless
[47:52] of the situation or condition that's
[47:54] around you hallelujah
[47:56] all right uh i think that's it uh can we
[47:59] now develop into the sufficient age i
[48:01] think that's wonderful it shows that you
[48:03] people have been following and that is
[48:05] very very encouraging
[48:08] okay so
[48:10] i i'm going to put
[48:12] put it on here
[48:14] and
[48:14] [Music]
[48:16] you will be listening in
[48:21] and then we shall pause whenever we
[48:23] discuss something if you have a question
[48:25] you just put up your hand
[48:27] and then i will
[48:29] reposition
[48:38] oh i realize i never
[48:40] did have this downloaded so
[48:43] i'm going to need a moment here
[48:47] sort that out

[49:15] really sweet

[49:19] message you realize
[49:21] that

[50:27] [Music]
[50:38] revelation revelation
[50:42] and unto the angel of the church in
[50:44] sardis right
[50:45] these things sayeth he that hath the
[50:47] seven spirits of god and the seven stars
[50:50] i know thy works that thou hast to name
[50:52] that thou livest and art dead
[50:55] be watchful and strengthen the things
[50:57] which remain that are ready to die
[51:00] for i have not found thy works perfect
[51:02] before god
[51:04] remember therefore how thou hast
[51:05] received and heard and hold fast and
[51:08] repent
[51:09] if therefore thou shalt not watch i will
[51:11] come on thee as a thief and thou shalt
[51:13] not know what hour i will come upon thee
[51:16] thou hast a few names even in sardis
[51:18] which have not defiled their garments
[51:21] and they shall walk with me in white for
[51:23] they are worthy
[51:24] he that overcometh the same shall be
[51:26] clothed in white raymond
[51:28] and i will not blot out his name out of
[51:30] the book of life but i will confess his
[51:32] name before my father and before his
[51:34] angels he that hath an ear let him hear
[51:38] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[51:42] sardis
[51:43] sardis was the capital of ancient lydia
[51:46] it passed from the hands of lydian
[51:48] monarchs to the persians and thence to
[51:50] alexander the great
[51:51] it was sacked by antiochus the great
[51:54] the kings of pergamus then succeeded to
[51:56] the dominion until the romans took over
[51:59] in the time of tiberius it was desolated
[52:01] by earthquakes and plagues
[52:03] today it is a heap of ruins and
[52:04] uninhabited
[52:06] this city was at one time very important
[52:08] commercially
[52:10] plenty said that the art of dying wool
[52:12] was invented here
[52:13] it was the center of wall dying and
[52:15] carpet weaving
[52:16] it had a goodly amount of silver and
[52:18] gold in the area and it is said that
[52:20] gold coins were first minted there
[52:22] it also had a slave market
[52:25] the religion of this city was the impure
[52:27] worship of the goddess civilian
[52:29] the massive ruins of the temple may
[52:31] still be seen
[52:33] you will recall that in the pergamian
[52:34] age i mentioned that the babylonish
[52:36] concept of mother and son known as
[52:39] semiramis and ninus became the sibley
[52:41] endious of asia the attributes attached
[52:44] to these two are most enlightening as we
[52:46] view them side by side
[52:48] he was the sun god she the moon goddess
[52:51] he was the lord of heaven she the queen
[52:54] of heaven
[52:55] he the revealer of goodness and truth
[52:57] she of gentleness and mercy he the
[53:00] mediator she the mediatrix
[53:03] he with the key that opens and shuts the
[53:05] gates of the invisible world and she
[53:07] with an identical key doing likewise
[53:10] he as the judge of the dead
[53:12] she is standing at his side
[53:14] he being killed raised and ascended into
[53:16] heaven
[53:17] she carried their bodily by the sun
[53:21] now in rome
[53:22] okay
[53:23] i want us to look at before we continue
[53:25] so much
[53:26] i want you to look at
[53:29] here as it begins to describe the city
[53:31] of service sardis was the capital of
[53:33] ancient lydia
[53:35] it passed from the hands of lydian
[53:36] monarchs to the persians and thence to
[53:38] alexander the great
[53:40] it was sacked by and
[53:42] remember you remember the questions
[53:47] and you remember
[53:50] the
[53:51] how many remember that i think we use we
[53:53] covered some time back
[53:55] regarding the
[53:57] uh
[53:59] the image that daniel saw
[54:03] how may i remember that
[54:04] the four kingdoms
[54:06] so do you remember the four kingdoms
[54:09] so which one was the passion then which
[54:11] one was
[54:12] that of an examination
[54:15] do you remember that
[54:16] i think i have a picture here of it
[54:19] i don't know
[54:20] all of you look as if you don't remember
[54:22] anything at all and this is something
[54:25] that we
[54:26] we have talked about here
[54:30] yes go ahead brother speaking
[54:48] the head of god
[54:52] the babylonian empire ruled by who at
[54:55] that time
[54:58] siri
[55:01] yes yes brother i'm hard but i wanted to
[55:03] be
[55:04] you know i want you to know what you're
[55:05] talking about because that's exactly
[55:07] true and it's what you're talking about
[55:09] so you need to speak it as if you
[55:10] believe it all right go ahead
[55:13] okay
[55:30] if
[55:43] okay you have the picture there now you
[55:44] can go ahead and explain
[55:57] um
[56:11] the second kingdom was the mid and the
[56:13] persian empires
[56:16] which were represented by the wrists and
[56:18] arms of sin
[56:20] then the third was the belly and thighs
[56:23] of brass
[56:24] was the
[56:26] macedonian empire
[56:40] the greek right
[56:43] uh
[56:45] we find out that um
[56:48] here they are saying that satis was a
[56:49] capital was the capital of the ancient
[56:52] lydia
[56:53] it passed from the hands of the of
[56:55] the lydian monarchs
[56:57] the passions
[56:59] and of course by the time the passions
[57:01] came that was after them caneza
[57:04] you understand what i'm talking about
[57:06] so that was after nebuchadnezzar
[57:08] then they went through
[57:11] the kingdom of the passions the the
[57:13] empire the passions
[57:14] then on down
[57:16] after that then the kingdom of the
[57:19] alexander the great the the
[57:21] emperor actually the young man who ruled
[57:23] the whole world
[57:25] and it was sacked by the anti by by anti
[57:28] antiochus the great
[57:30] the kings of pegamos then succeeded to
[57:33] the dominion until the romans took over
[57:36] of course you know the romans came
[57:38] came came much later down here on the
[57:41] legs of iron huh that's when the the the
[57:44] romans came after that oh we didn't have
[57:46] that projector but i'm seeing the
[57:47] picture here but of course you can see
[57:49] this on youtube
[57:50] so
[57:52] the romans come much much later
[57:54] and uh they also still took over their
[57:57] rule of uh the city of lydia or in
[58:00] science
[58:01] so in the time of tiberius costa
[58:04] hiberius how many are not like tiberius
[58:07] i mean i've heard of that name before
[58:10] only one person
[58:12] but you you all have had it because you
[58:14] have read this part have you not
[58:20] taken yes by the way if you're studying
[58:22] and you're reading don't just listen as
[58:24] if you're listening to some music
[58:26] when you see something that you have not
[58:28] ever
[58:30] known about
[58:32] research make a research about it
[58:35] huh you have google you know you can use
[58:37] google someone called it brother google
[58:39] he said
[58:40] the only thing he will not do is to go
[58:42] to heaven but the rest he knows
[58:45] you will ask him who is
[58:50] and everything about you but actually
[58:51] brother google knows everything but he
[58:53] cannot go to heaven because he has no
[58:55] holocaust you know
[58:56] he would if you ask him what's the holy
[58:58] ghost he will explain
[59:00] but
[59:00] but he cannot receive the holy ghost but
[59:03] you can just explain it so you
[59:04] understand so
[59:06] this message is not about knowing
[59:07] knowing
[59:09] yeah he knows all the theology
[59:12] but he doesn't know the life he doesn't
[59:14] have the life you understand to have and
[59:16] to know are two different things so i
[59:18] don't want you only to know and i don't
[59:20] want you all into half you should have
[59:22] both
[59:24] amen okay so tiberius was a roman
[59:27] emperor like
[59:29] like uh
[59:30] constantine and others
[59:32] so it was a hymn in the time of tiberius
[59:35] it was desolated by earthquakes and
[59:37] brains
[59:39] excuse me today it is a leap of rings
[59:42] sahip rather of rings and
[59:45] and
[59:47] it inhabited so so the city was at a
[59:50] time very important commercial
[59:53] and uh
[59:54] so of course here down there then it
[59:56] brings in the religion of this
[59:59] how city
[59:59] were watching the goddess the cyber you
[1:00:01] know cyborg i think we've also talked
[1:00:03] about it in the previous chapters
[1:00:05] the massive rings of the temple may
[1:00:07] still be seen so you will recall that in
[1:00:09] vega the pegament eight i mentioned that
[1:00:12] the bablonish concept of mother and son
[1:00:14] i'm gonna remember that
[1:00:16] we talked about that in the babylonian
[1:00:18] empire you know about the mother and son
[1:00:20] and he tied it in together we got to
[1:00:22] happen in rome he was showing us that
[1:00:24] the religion of mother and son did not
[1:00:25] just begin now
[1:00:27] it started back at them in vegas and we
[1:00:29] see the same thing happening today the
[1:00:32] same religion of mother and son
[1:00:34] you know hey mary mother of god so there
[1:00:37] is a mother
[1:00:38] and then they deserve a son
[1:00:40] the son god and a mother go there that
[1:00:43] kind of religion so it says you remember
[1:00:45] that idea
[1:00:46] known as this
[1:00:48] semiramis and the
[1:00:50] nairs became
[1:00:52] the cybele and the owners of asia so you
[1:00:55] realize that in every part of the world
[1:00:58] there was this same idea
[1:01:02] in every
[1:01:03] time there was that same idea over over
[1:01:06] goddess and a god goddess and a god when
[1:01:09] they go to india they have their version
[1:01:10] when you go to arab arabian countries
[1:01:12] they have their fashion when you go to
[1:01:14] the middle east they have their fashion
[1:01:15] when you come to africa they also have
[1:01:17] their fashions you know you know us
[1:01:22] also they have that version of nazi
[1:01:25] namibia
[1:01:27] and um
[1:01:30] then you're there when you go to europe
[1:01:32] when you go through easter when you go
[1:01:34] everywhere they had their passion those
[1:01:36] are pagan versions of who god is
[1:01:41] you see it's the same idea and this was
[1:01:44] the same idea that it was not trans
[1:01:45] transferred into a a church system a
[1:01:48] religious
[1:01:49] system
[1:01:50] so i want you to follow to follow
[1:01:52] through here and we see how he is
[1:01:55] explaining now the version of service
[1:01:59] as a
[1:02:01] as a city and as a place
[1:02:03] right
[1:02:05] are we following on
[1:02:07] so i wanted to be following very very
[1:02:09] closely so that you don't get to
[1:02:11] miss any idea
[1:02:13] if something passes you then you can ask
[1:02:15] you don't need to just uh sit back and
[1:02:18] relax because
[1:02:19] the great
[1:02:20] the kings of pergamus then succeeded to
[1:02:23] the dominion until the romans took over
[1:02:25] in the time of tiberius it was desolated
[1:02:27] by earthquakes and plagues
[1:02:29] today it is a heap of ruins and
[1:02:31] uninhabited
[1:02:33] this city was at one time very important
[1:02:35] commercially
[1:02:36] plenty said that the art of dying wool
[1:02:38] was invented here
[1:02:40] it was the center of wall dying and
[1:02:41] carpet weaving
[1:02:43] it had a goodly amount of silver and
[1:02:45] gold in the area and it is said that
[1:02:47] gold coins were first minted there
[1:02:49] it also had a slave market
[1:02:52] the religion of this city was the impure
[1:02:54] worship of the goddess civilly
[1:02:56] the massive ruins of the temple may
[1:02:58] still be seen
[1:02:59] you will recall that in the pergam age i
[1:03:02] mentioned that the babylonish concept of
[1:03:04] mother and son known as semiramis and
[1:03:06] ninus became the sibley and the oes of
[1:03:09] asia the attributes attached to these
[1:03:11] two are most enlightening as we view
[1:03:13] them side by side
[1:03:15] he was the sun god she the moon goddess
[1:03:18] he was the lord of heaven she the queen
[1:03:20] of heaven
[1:03:21] he the revealer of goodness and truth
[1:03:24] she of gentleness and mercy
[1:03:26] he the mediator she the
[1:03:28] mediatrix he with the key that opens and
[1:03:31] shuts the game
[1:03:35] the son of god and the moon god
[1:03:38] the son of god is the lord of heaven
[1:03:40] the the
[1:03:41] the the the moon god is the kingdom of
[1:03:44] heaven
[1:03:46] the son of god is the reveal of goodness
[1:03:47] or truth the the moon god is the one of
[1:03:50] jesus and mercy the son of god is a
[1:03:52] mediator
[1:03:54] and she's the mediatrix you see so jesus
[1:03:57] can immediate but also american
[1:04:00] idea it came from right here
[1:04:05] it's of the invisible world and she with
[1:04:07] an identical key doing likewise
[1:04:10] he as the judge of the dead
[1:04:12] she is standing at his side
[1:04:14] he being killed raised and ascended into
[1:04:17] heaven she carried their bodily by the
[1:04:19] sun
[1:04:21] now in rome this same god is given the
[1:04:23] title of our lord
[1:04:24] he is called the son of god while she is
[1:04:27] called the mother of god
[1:04:29] now that is what we found back there in
[1:04:31] the other two ages where the mother and
[1:04:33] son concept took on such tremendous
[1:04:36] proportions
[1:04:37] but now notice that even as it was back
[1:04:39] in babylon that the worship of the sun
[1:04:41] began to lose out in favor of the
[1:04:43] worship of the mother
[1:04:45] so she literally began to take the place
[1:04:47] of the sun
[1:04:48] we see in this age that the pagan
[1:04:50] worship of sardis was the worship of the
[1:04:52] woman
[1:04:53] it is civilly alone not civilly and the
[1:04:55] oes
[1:04:57] the mother has literally taken the place
[1:04:59] of the sun endowed with the merits of
[1:05:01] godhead
[1:05:02] all one needs to do is go over her
[1:05:04] various titles and recall the lovely
[1:05:06] attributes accorded mary by the roman
[1:05:07] church to understand where the religion
[1:05:10] of this age came from
[1:05:12] two things really struck me with force
[1:05:14] as i looked into this worship of civilly
[1:05:17] one was the fact that she wore a key
[1:05:19] like janus which gave her the same
[1:05:20] authority as janus
[1:05:22] key to heaven and earth and the
[1:05:24] mysteries
[1:05:25] and the fact that the worshipers whip
[1:05:27] themselves until blood spurts from their
[1:05:29] bodies which thing is done right today
[1:05:31] by the catholics who feel they are
[1:05:32] suffering like the lord
[1:05:35] the fact that this is the age of the
[1:05:37] first real break with papal rome that
[1:05:39] actually flourished no doubt caused the
[1:05:41] jezebel prophetess to consolidate and
[1:05:43] emphasize her doctrine of meriolatry in
[1:05:46] decided opposition to the protestants
[1:05:48] who denied her any part whatsoever in
[1:05:50] the plan of salvation apart from her
[1:05:52] favor with god as the virgin chosen to
[1:05:54] bear the babe
[1:05:55] as luther crystallized the doctrine of
[1:05:57] justification by faith they held to
[1:05:59] works penance prayers and other
[1:06:01] unscriptural means and as the freed
[1:06:04] christians glorified the sun the roman
[1:06:07] catholics increased their deification of
[1:06:09] mary until the 20th century saw in
[1:06:11] opposition to most high-ranking roman
[1:06:13] theologians pope pius literally exalt
[1:06:16] mary to glorification in a resurrected
[1:06:18] body
[1:06:19] that doctrine is absolutely the
[1:06:21] babylonish one of the sun carrying the
[1:06:22] mother bodily into heaven
[1:06:26] no wonder this fifth age goes right
[1:06:27] along with the other ages and will do so
[1:06:30] until it ends in the lake of fire where
[1:06:32] the and her children are killed in
[1:06:33] the second death
[1:06:35] there it is marioletry the worship of
[1:06:37] siboli
[1:06:38] by the way did you know that sibilly was
[1:06:40] the astarte that jezebel was priestess
[1:06:42] to and caused israel to stumble by the
[1:06:45] licentious rights that she conducted
[1:06:47] yes that is who she
[1:06:50] this paragraph is very very important
[1:06:53] and i wonder it goes right along with
[1:06:57] the other ages
[1:06:58] and he says
[1:07:00] uh so until it ends in the lake of fire
[1:07:04] where the war and the children
[1:07:06] are killed in the second day
[1:07:09] and you go in the book of revelation in
[1:07:11] your mind
[1:07:13] give me that verse
[1:07:15] i want to see
[1:07:17] what the bible says
[1:07:19] about the war
[1:07:22] and our children
[1:07:25] of course in the relation chapter
[1:07:34] 20 is when saturn is bound
[1:07:37] and the millennium happens
[1:07:45] read
[1:07:46] 19
[1:07:48] revelation 19 20.
[1:07:54] mm-hmm
[1:08:10] and the beast was taken and with him the
[1:08:12] first prophet
[1:08:13] that
[1:08:14] that wrote miracles before him
[1:08:19] okay before him
[1:08:21] and that right for him which with which
[1:08:24] he deceived them that had received the
[1:08:26] mark of the beast
[1:08:27] and them that worshipped his image
[1:08:30] of course you know what that image is
[1:08:32] how many who knows that what that is
[1:08:37] yes go ahead
[1:08:39] bro what's the image
[1:08:49] who wants to correct you what's the
[1:08:51] image yes it's the sound
[1:08:54] the wide concept charges they call they
[1:08:57] coming together all the denominations of
[1:08:59] the world
[1:09:00] they will create an image to the beast
[1:09:04] this is the image
[1:09:06] all right where was i
[1:09:09] these both were cast alive into the lake
[1:09:12] of fire
[1:09:14] with
[1:09:15] brimstone
[1:09:17] the first prophet and the beast
[1:09:20] and all of them that worship this image
[1:09:24] and this lack of fire
[1:09:25] is the second day
[1:09:28] separation with god
[1:09:30] that's the death of the souls now
[1:09:33] these days that we die here is not a
[1:09:35] real date by the way that is frustrating
[1:09:37] do you think it's a real day hey
[1:09:39] that one is just changing this nation
[1:09:42] you are going to have hair which is also
[1:09:43] not burning
[1:09:45] but also don't think you are going to
[1:09:46] throw parties in here in here there's no
[1:09:48] throwing parties because there's a place
[1:09:50] of discomfort
[1:09:52] it's a place of discomfort i wanted to
[1:09:54] imagine you in a place where you you're
[1:09:56] not burning up completely you're not
[1:09:57] dying
[1:09:58] but
[1:09:59] you you are
[1:10:01] discomforted you are
[1:10:04] you you are not happy you are
[1:10:07] tormented suppressor of torment i think
[1:10:09] that's the right one i was looking for
[1:10:11] you know to make a day each day out day
[1:10:20] waiting for this time and imagine
[1:10:23] suffering waiting for this time when
[1:10:25] would this time be
[1:10:27] this time would be after the millennium
[1:10:31] so people who are going to hell they
[1:10:32] will be there
[1:10:35] and then we're going to the millennium
[1:10:36] and then we finish it
[1:10:38] we finish the marriage supper we finish
[1:10:40] the berenium when they're still there
[1:10:43] so friends
[1:10:44] don't think it's going to be a a simple
[1:10:47] thing it's going to be a very difficult
[1:10:49] thing
[1:10:50] when you have an opportunity and you're
[1:10:52] still young
[1:10:53] utilize your time and don't go to hell
[1:10:56] you see if you go to hell surely you
[1:10:59] will be tormented
[1:11:01] you will be tormented
[1:11:03] don't serve god because of fear of hell
[1:11:06] love god and serve him because you know
[1:11:08] that you don't belong to hell you belong
[1:11:10] to him and your portion is not in here
[1:11:14] but i know that there are people here on
[1:11:17] earth
[1:11:18] and in this room where we are now there
[1:11:20] are some of those also
[1:11:22] who are not going to go to hell but they
[1:11:24] are going to go in heaven
[1:11:26] and when they reach there they will
[1:11:29] rejoice with god
[1:11:31] for three and a half years
[1:11:32] they'll come back down here in the space
[1:11:35] of a thousand years a millennium with
[1:11:37] christ and rule with him
[1:11:40] then we shall be super men and super
[1:11:42] women you'll find that black people are
[1:11:43] playing and doesn't move his acting
[1:11:45] doesn't superman
[1:11:47] they are trying to do a replica of what
[1:11:49] we are going to be in the iranian
[1:11:52] those things is going to happen but not
[1:11:53] here there
[1:11:55] you have seen those things of uh vamp is
[1:11:57] it vampire not vampire those things of
[1:11:59] uh
[1:12:00] is it those things that they say that
[1:12:02] come from whatever another planet
[1:12:05] audience hey you hit it and then you
[1:12:07] catch into peace and then joins itself
[1:12:09] again together
[1:12:11] you know those ideas i don't know where
[1:12:13] science gets them from but actually this
[1:12:14] is what it's going to be like
[1:12:16] you cannot be killed once you added to
[1:12:18] the other body
[1:12:20] you can't die again even the bible says
[1:12:24] hallelujah i feel religious right now
[1:12:26] the bible says amen when we enter into
[1:12:29] the other body there will death will
[1:12:31] have no power
[1:12:32] the second lack of power over us

[1:13:58] we're gonna be well
[1:14:01] yeah
[1:14:02] it's not a place
[1:14:05] millennium is a period of time
[1:14:07] yeah
[1:14:08] millennium is a thousand years we know
[1:14:10] we are going to be within that time also
[1:14:12] but we are what shall we be doing at
[1:14:14] that time
[1:14:20] hey you people
[1:14:22] hallelujah
[1:14:24] do you know what the millennium is going
[1:14:25] to be for us i think we should talk
[1:14:27] about it
[1:14:28] millennium is a place millennium is a
[1:14:30] time
[1:14:31] a period of a thousand years
[1:14:36] where we shall not die
[1:14:40] where we shall not be sick
[1:14:42] where we shall be with the lord for all
[1:14:44] that time
[1:14:46] we will not be serving the lord because
[1:14:50] we are not his servants at that time
[1:14:53] just like you brothers wanting to marry
[1:14:55] waves to serve you waves about your
[1:14:57] servants
[1:14:59] what's really are supposed to be
[1:15:02] your queens

[1:15:21] when we have entropy in the millennium
[1:15:22] we are going to rule because the bible
[1:15:24] says they will rule with a lot of
[1:15:26] iron

[1:15:31] meaning without mercy
[1:15:35] his wife is fighting not
[1:15:48] what shall they be doing they shall rule
[1:15:51] with him
[1:15:54] remember the battle says what about the
[1:15:56] 144 where would they be
[1:15:59] there will be a millennium too

[1:24:46] after our action the bible says when you
[1:24:48] read down here you will see that the
[1:24:49] bible says that you know of course one
[1:24:51] person asked me pastor i've been
[1:24:54] following what you have been saying
[1:24:56] one thing
[1:25:00] before the animal
[1:25:02] comes
[1:25:05] the third world war right
[1:25:07] what's the third one
[1:25:09] armageddon
[1:25:10] so before the millennium comes the
[1:25:12] armageddon and by the man says the
[1:25:14] armageddon destroys all
[1:25:17] all things so where will the people that
[1:25:20] we shall rule overcome from individuals
[1:25:38] which will survive
[1:25:40] i've always i don't know it's just our
[1:25:42] opinion i've always heard it to say that
[1:25:44] how would they survive the fires that
[1:25:46] really bad up the world atomic bombs and
[1:25:48] everything
[1:25:53] some of these rich people
[1:25:55] that
[1:25:56] you know
[1:25:58] have enough money
[1:25:59] they think they can go to the moon or
[1:26:01] they think they can
[1:26:03] be with bankers you know bankers
[1:26:06] how many bankers
[1:26:16] deep down in the crust of the earth
[1:26:18] whereby
[1:26:20] uh
[1:26:21] even if they hit an atomic bomb or
[1:26:23] something or a nuclear bomb it can't go
[1:26:26] through they are protected
[1:26:28] so some of these people they will know
[1:26:30] that hey now it is a
[1:26:32] bad moment let us escape
[1:26:34] they will escape they would leave these
[1:26:35] zero groups to monday
[1:26:38] whatever for them they would escape they
[1:26:41] were going to the bankers
[1:26:43] and they haven't even acted the movies
[1:26:44] out of those things then they will come
[1:26:46] out when the earth is completely
[1:27:02] the
[1:27:02] sea
[1:27:04] they will not play so quickly
[1:27:06] but they will not know that there is a
[1:27:09] let me call it this way aliens
[1:27:11] that look over there
[1:27:14] they will not know that there was there
[1:27:16] is another race
[1:27:17] and other people
[1:27:18] that actually now all in the world
[1:27:23] and you know who those people will be
[1:27:26] they will be having a different body
[1:27:28] even if you box it
[1:27:30] your hand just goes through maybe
[1:27:33] yeah
[1:27:34] one person will be there digging maybe
[1:27:37] then they will come
[1:27:38] here
[1:27:39] maybe some of these religions i don't
[1:27:40] want to mention their name this word
[1:27:42] known people they will apply that
[1:27:45] god will make sure that these rich ones
[1:27:47] they will be not only the second half
[1:27:50] but we shall also rule over them
[1:27:53] it will be they also reproduce and then
[1:27:55] the medical election will come now there
[1:27:57] will be visas
[1:28:13] and then did you touch it when i wanted
[1:28:14] to touch it disappeared really
[1:28:17] you were joking then the father said
[1:28:19] they will be saved
[1:28:22] finally
[1:28:23] there is a city it's a very big city
[1:28:25] which is
[1:28:26] looking so glamorous
[1:28:29] viewed with wars out of this world
[1:28:32] with a technology that has never been
[1:28:33] seen
[1:28:34] and then they would say where can these
[1:28:36] things come from
[1:28:38] they couldn't they would just leave they
[1:28:39] said this thing we cannot we don't know
[1:28:41] just wait let us go let us stick with
[1:28:43] this present episode one and then one
[1:28:46] day
[1:28:46] it is in this chapter
[1:28:49] after the end of the 1000 years the
[1:28:51] bible says
[1:28:54] that the devil will be losed
[1:29:00] remember for a seven years the devil was
[1:29:03] bound
[1:29:04] by the end of a thousand years the devil
[1:29:06] will be
[1:29:07] lost and when he's lost where would he
[1:29:10] go
[1:29:12] he has to find a vessel for you you know
[1:29:13] that there is not a vessel
[1:29:16] see if all of us refuse the devil to use
[1:29:18] us you know he's going to be part of the
[1:29:19] samanas
[1:29:20] yes
[1:29:21] suddenly that some of you cooperated
[1:29:23] with the devil so much
[1:29:26] that's a very weak guy very weak very
[1:29:29] weak friend
[1:29:31] when he comes out of the bottomless pit
[1:29:36] all the demons yes where can we go then
[1:29:39] you will find those
[1:29:42] those rich guys there
[1:29:44] of course they were rich in the other
[1:29:45] ones not in this one
[1:29:47] those prisons they are not prisoners
[1:29:49] say
[1:30:16] the bible tells me
[1:30:18] that fire from from heaven will come
[1:30:21] down hallelujah and it will abandon up
[1:30:24] all of them
[1:30:26] finish them up in a minute
[1:30:31] now what am i going to do now and before
[1:30:32] they ever lose it i began
[1:30:35] that
[1:30:36] will catch him
[1:30:38] now this is your last moment
[1:30:40] you had your chance
[1:30:42] that time the level is going to be
[1:30:43] finished we wanted the reddit
[1:30:46] the beast the dragon and the false
[1:30:47] prophet
[1:30:49] it's time your time now to go
[1:30:53] and now i'm going to the bottom right
[1:30:54] and not in the brothers but in the lake
[1:30:56] of fire
[1:30:57] give me that chapter
[1:30:58] you will see it's so amazing i tell you
[1:31:00] hallelujah
[1:31:01] and after that time they will be
[1:31:04] throughout the lake of fire another fire
[1:31:05] will be there for how long it will be
[1:31:07] there for as long as
[1:31:09] as long as
[1:31:10] god wants and then of course he will do
[1:31:12] away with it
[1:31:14] chapter 21 says behold i swear new
[1:31:16] heaven and the new earth the new heaven
[1:31:18] and the new earth did not have hair
[1:31:21] hallelujah
[1:31:23] and and laid hold on the dragon that all
[1:31:25] suffered which is the devil and suddenly
[1:31:27] and bound him a thousand years okay and
[1:31:30] he cast him into the bottomless pit and
[1:31:31] shut him up and set a seer upon him that
[1:31:34] he should receive the nations no more
[1:31:35] until the thousand years should be
[1:31:38] fulfilled you have seen that party and
[1:31:40] after that he must be used a little
[1:31:42] season when is that little season the
[1:31:44] one i told you about that
[1:31:46] of gogan
[1:31:48] here's what it is and they saw
[1:31:50] surrounded and they sat upon them and
[1:31:52] judgment was given unto them and i saw
[1:31:54] the souls of them that were beheaded for
[1:31:55] the witness of jesus and for the word of
[1:31:57] god and with which had not worshipped
[1:32:00] the beast neither his image neither had
[1:32:02] received his mark upon their foreheads
[1:32:04] oh in their hands and they leave them

[1:32:34] were finished
[1:32:36] this is the first
[1:32:38] resurrection
[1:32:42] we notice
[1:32:44] that a thousand years
[1:32:46] will be finished and then we shall have
[1:32:47] another mass resurrection
[1:32:51] for all people who have died they were
[1:32:53] right all those who are in hell whatever
[1:32:55] they will come up
[1:32:57] they will come out to face the wrath and
[1:33:00] him and he will be with you
[1:33:04] god bless you hallelujah he will do with
[1:33:06] his wife to judge the living and dead
[1:33:10] dead
[1:33:12] blessed and holy is he that had part in
[1:33:15] the first resurrection
[1:33:18] on such
[1:33:20] the second death has no power
[1:33:22] but they that they shall be priests of
[1:33:25] god and of christ and shall reign with
[1:33:26] him a thousand
[1:33:28] years and when the thousand years are
[1:33:30] expired saturn shall not be loosed out
[1:33:33] of his freedom of

[1:33:52] together with this one you will see the
[1:33:54] story i was giving you tithe perfectly
[1:33:56] and they went up on the breadth of the
[1:33:58] earth and compassed the camp of the
[1:33:59] saints about the carbon compass around
[1:34:01] the beloved city and fire
[1:34:04] came down from god out of heaven and
[1:34:06] divided them
[1:34:09] think about it
[1:34:10] and the devil that deceived them was
[1:34:12] cast into the lake of fire and
[1:34:13] grievously you see that the part
[1:34:15] where the beast and the first prophet
[1:34:17] are and shall be tormented day and night
[1:34:19] forever and
[1:34:20] and says forever and ever does not
[1:34:22] necessarily mean eternally it only means
[1:34:24] that it will be forever and ever and
[1:34:26] ever and ever until it says full stop
[1:34:28] get out
[1:34:30] and i saw a great white throne and he in
[1:34:32] the sun
[1:34:33] on it now you might say now where where
[1:34:35] will the white throne judgment be it's
[1:34:37] going to be at this moment
[1:34:39] after we have enjoyed it with him now he
[1:34:40] will say that's good worker now hey
[1:34:43] come back with us
[1:34:44] hey cover that's good what they were
[1:34:46] gonna would you like a living hand
[1:34:49] hmm
[1:34:51] and him that sat on it from whose face
[1:34:53] the after the heaven fled away and there
[1:34:55] was found no place for them and i saw
[1:34:57] the dead small and great stand before
[1:34:59] god and the books were opened and
[1:35:01] another book was open which is the book
[1:35:02] of life hallelujah right here with me
[1:35:06] which is the book of life and the dead
[1:35:08] were judged out of those things which
[1:35:10] were written in the books according to
[1:35:11] their
[1:35:12] what and the city shall they still give
[1:35:14] them gave up the dead which were
[1:35:16] immediately and death and they have
[1:35:17] delivered up the day
[1:35:19] you see all those which were inherent it
[1:35:21] was time for them to come
[1:35:24] they have to come out to be giant
[1:35:26] they leave it up the dead which were in
[1:35:28] them and they were judged every man
[1:35:29] according to their
[1:35:31] works and death and hell was cast into
[1:35:33] the lake of fire and that's the second
[1:35:37] we don't want to be that second date
[1:35:38] that's a very bad one now
[1:35:40] and whosoever wasn't found written in
[1:35:42] the book of life was cast into the lake
[1:35:43] of
[1:35:44] fire hallelujah
[1:35:47] and then verse 22 chapter 21 verse one
[1:35:49] says that i saw a new heaven and a new
[1:35:52] life for the first heaven and the first
[1:35:54] art war passed away and there was no
[1:35:56] more seat
[1:35:58] there was no more
[1:36:01] did you know that that even there was no
[1:36:02] more sun
[1:36:04] no more sea
[1:36:05] no more sun no there were many things we
[1:36:07] should not be there
[1:36:09] hallelujah and there will be you
[1:36:12] and he
[1:36:15] my god let us go back to the church
[1:36:17] anymore yo people i don't know i don't
[1:36:19] know about you i'm enjoying this
[1:36:22] hallelujah
[1:36:24] all right
[1:36:25] so we noticed that here the lack of fire
[1:36:28] which where the war and the children are
[1:36:30] killed the second death you now you know
[1:36:31] what we're talking about
[1:36:33] that's the second that happens there
[1:36:36] who is the war
[1:36:38] who is the one the war
[1:36:46] people speak up speaker
[1:36:50] the war is catholicism
[1:36:53] hallelujah
[1:36:54] that idea of not the people who were
[1:36:56] there right there were not catholics
[1:36:57] never said that
[1:36:59] but those ones some of them are even
[1:37:01] afraid they will come up okay
[1:37:03] i'm talking about catholicism as other
[1:37:05] media as an idea as a first doctrine as
[1:37:07] a first religion that really just forced
[1:37:09] religious system
[1:37:11] we are talking about the system whoever
[1:37:12] is listening to us not the people the
[1:37:14] system
[1:37:18] that first radio system is the wall
[1:37:20] she's the great prostitute she's the
[1:37:22] great one the mother of all of them
[1:37:26] that one and our children she has
[1:37:28] children and all her children are
[1:37:29] daughters she has no boy
[1:37:34] she's a woman and she gave birth to
[1:37:36] children only which are girls
[1:37:38] and remember a woman means judge
[1:37:43] therefore these children since she is a
[1:37:45] church her children are also churches
[1:37:49] tax systems
[1:37:51] that are teaching wrong doctrines
[1:37:55] why are they daughters because they came
[1:37:56] out of her
[1:37:58] and when they came out of her they
[1:37:59] organized like and when they organize
[1:38:02] like they become like
[1:38:05] everything is the same every document is
[1:38:07] the same every ideology is the same they
[1:38:09] stand by
[1:38:11] they start
[1:38:13] this thing they sat
[1:38:15] they said they make their own cruise
[1:38:16] they do something
[1:38:18] they they they you know they join their
[1:38:20] accounts of texas these ones everyone
[1:38:22] they sell free they believe the tribute
[1:38:23] they all believe the trinity
[1:38:26] so this war that children they will be
[1:38:29] killed in the second death
[1:38:32] by the way in the second day there will
[1:38:34] be no forgiveness
[1:38:36] so if you thought that you were going to
[1:38:37] survive well interrupted then you you
[1:38:39] you end up
[1:38:40] going in heaven somehow forget that let
[1:38:42] me tell you if you listen to this
[1:38:44] message and you don't make it in the
[1:38:45] rapture you you you are deceived by the
[1:38:47] music because you can't even be part of
[1:38:49] the foolish pages
[1:38:52] yes you can't even be part of the
[1:38:54] foolish version some people have had
[1:38:55] them say well let me be the best because
[1:38:57] if i fail at this point in the rapture i
[1:38:59] can be forgiven who told you
[1:39:01] do you even know that there is a full
[1:39:02] value footage but you will not even know
[1:39:04] that she's there
[1:39:05] the mother says that you know you you
[1:39:08] will tell them you were up to me you
[1:39:10] owed this to me and they would say why
[1:39:12] did we do that for you
[1:39:13] they will not even know some people
[1:39:15] these will be the people who will have
[1:39:16] good hearts naturally
[1:39:18] unless you are there
[1:39:20] they may even not be christians at all
[1:39:23] so my friend
[1:39:25] those people
[1:39:26] don't think that it is you
[1:39:28] you you are either the bride
[1:39:30] oh you are going in the
[1:39:32] wreck of fire
[1:39:35] some idea
[1:39:36] don't let me aim for that
[1:39:39] let me aim for the sun and this i will
[1:39:41] give the stars who told you
[1:39:44] it will not work in this case
[1:39:47] you are you are either the bride
[1:39:49] or you are going to hell
[1:39:53] praise the lord
[1:39:54] but i believe i'm the bride
[1:39:56] i'm not scaring you don't feel bad
[1:39:59] hallelujah
[1:40:00] what i'm saying
[1:40:01] mean what you believe
[1:40:03] because you're not born to go to hell
[1:40:06] and neither are you going to be a free
[1:40:07] dragon you are born to be a son and a
[1:40:09] daughter of god
[1:40:12] so there it is
[1:40:15] today we are ending on the on the on the
[1:40:18] introduction only but i think it's okay
[1:40:26] by the way did you know that cyber
[1:40:28] was the ass astound that jezebel was
[1:40:32] priest priestess to
[1:40:35] and caused israel to stumble by the
[1:40:38] president's
[1:40:40] rights that she conducted
[1:40:44] so you see that cyber was a goddess
[1:40:47] a goddess
[1:40:48] jezebel
[1:40:50] was watching simon as well
[1:40:52] so you see
[1:40:54] this goddess today we have it in the
[1:40:56] form of mary
[1:40:58] the mother of god this is
[1:41:01] this is
[1:41:03] idolatry
[1:41:04] i doubt that's what it is idolatry
[1:41:07] it's the same same thing of all
[1:41:10] so
[1:41:10] whenever you see you don't think it is
[1:41:12] something new
[1:41:13] it is not new
[1:41:15] it has been there from the very
[1:41:16] beginning and the bible speaks a bit
[1:41:19] very very well
[1:41:21] so let's uh go a little bit in the edge
[1:41:23] and
[1:41:24] the introduction part here then we shall
[1:41:26] leave the rest for
[1:41:28] another meeting the sardisian or fifth
[1:41:30] church
[1:41:34] it is usually called the age of the
[1:41:36] reformation
[1:41:38] the messenger
[1:41:41] the messenger to this age is the best
[1:41:43] known messenger of all the ages he was
[1:41:45] martin luther
[1:41:47] martin luther was a brilliant scholar of
[1:41:49] gentle disposition
[1:41:50] he was studying to be a lawyer when the
[1:41:52] lingering illness and death of a near
[1:41:54] friend caused him to become serious
[1:41:56] concerning the spiritual condition of
[1:41:58] his life
[1:41:59] he entered the augustinian convented
[1:42:01] effort in 1505
[1:42:03] there he studied philosophy and also the
[1:42:06] word of god
[1:42:07] he lived the life of severest penance
[1:42:09] but all the outward acts could not
[1:42:11] banish his sense of sin
[1:42:13] he said
[1:42:14] i tormented myself to death to make
[1:42:16] peace with god but i was in darkness and
[1:42:18] found it not
[1:42:20] the vicar general of his order staupitz
[1:42:23] helped him to gain the insight that his
[1:42:25] salvation would have to be the
[1:42:27] experience of an inner work rather than
[1:42:28] a ritual
[1:42:30] with this encouragement he further
[1:42:32] sought god
[1:42:33] later he became a priest
[1:42:35] as yet he was not saved he became an
[1:42:38] avid and deep student of the word and of
[1:42:40] the great theological works extent
[1:42:43] he was sought out as a teacher and
[1:42:44] preacher for his depth of knowledge and
[1:42:46] great sincerity
[1:42:48] to fulfill a vow he had made to himself
[1:42:50] he went to rome
[1:42:51] there he saw the futility of the
[1:42:53] church's imposed works that were to
[1:42:55] bring salvation and the word of god
[1:42:57] struck home to his heart
[1:42:59] the just shall live by faith
[1:43:02] on his return home the evangelical truth
[1:43:04] of this scripture flooded his mind and
[1:43:06] he was set free from sin and born into
[1:43:08] the kingdom of god
[1:43:10] soon after this he was elevated to
[1:43:12] doctor of divinity and commissioned
[1:43:14] to devote his whole life to study and
[1:43:16] faithfully expound and defend the holy
[1:43:18] scripture
[1:43:20] this he did and with such effect that
[1:43:22] his heart and the hearts of those around
[1:43:24] him were deeply fixed upon the truth of
[1:43:26] the word
[1:43:27] the word soon came into open conflict
[1:43:29] with the abuses of church creeds and
[1:43:31] doctrines
[1:43:32] thus when leo the tenth became pope and
[1:43:35] john tetzel came to sell indulgences for
[1:43:37] sin
[1:43:38] luther had no choice but to rise up
[1:43:40] against this anti-scriptural teaching
[1:43:43] first he thundered from the pulpit
[1:43:44] against it and then wrote his famous
[1:43:46] ninety five theses which on october
[1:43:48] thirty first fifteen seventeen he nailed
[1:43:51] to the door of castle church
[1:43:54] all right that part there that paragraph
[1:43:56] is also a very good one for us to look
[1:43:58] at
[1:44:00] so leo
[1:44:01] the letters
[1:44:02] sometimes i read them for you
[1:44:04] here do it as a martin luther
[1:44:07] king
[1:44:08] i don't know if some of you remember
[1:44:10] that i've read for you several times all
[1:44:12] those letters
[1:44:13] there's a leon the 10th
[1:44:16] was a pop at that time and john teselle
[1:44:20] john tesla
[1:44:21] everybody said john tells them
[1:44:24] so he started to sell indulgences
[1:44:28] for see do you know what an indulgence
[1:44:30] is
[1:44:37] yes sister
[1:44:39] you have an idea what is it speak loudly
[1:44:50] yeah something like that but you have to
[1:44:52] explain it very well
[1:44:54] you see
[1:44:57] they put together a list of things
[1:45:00] they just let's say a piece of paper
[1:45:04] and in this piece of paper
[1:45:06] it was commissioned from rome
[1:45:09] and it was said
[1:45:11] to
[1:45:13] all the people
[1:45:15] that
[1:45:17] are going to be
[1:45:19] all that desire that seems to be
[1:45:21] forgiven
[1:45:23] john tesla was working on behalf of pope
[1:45:26] leo
[1:45:28] and rome
[1:45:29] and he said anyone who wants their seeds
[1:45:31] to be forgiven
[1:45:32] should simply buy that piece of scrub or
[1:45:34] paper
[1:45:41] let's say that this is the paper
[1:45:44] and they say they read he read for them
[1:45:46] said whosoever
[1:45:48] wants their sins to be forgiven
[1:45:54] should buy in the name of the church i
[1:45:56] mean and in the name of popular over the
[1:45:58] term
[1:46:00] you should buy this piece of indulgence
[1:46:05] and the scenes you know they used to
[1:46:07] depends you know what penis
[1:46:10] is do you know what penises
[1:46:14] anyone knows no custeras you you wanted
[1:46:17] to be a catholic
[1:46:19] sister so tell us
[1:46:21] what is
[1:46:28] sometimes they would be difficult to do
[1:46:29] many things which were very difficult
[1:46:31] for them to do
[1:46:32] like meeting themselves in time by the
[1:46:34] time they leave even their skin is
[1:46:36] broken
[1:46:38] yeah by the way those catholics they're
[1:46:40] very sincere people very sincere
[1:46:43] it's not like they said god and they
[1:46:45] beat yourself
[1:46:47] and then you don't do it you dare not do
[1:46:49] that whatever they tell you to do you do
[1:46:51] it very well
[1:46:53] so they wanted to say now
[1:46:55] it is a new
[1:46:57] thing you only buy this piece of paper
[1:47:00] and once you buy the sales you have
[1:47:02] committed
[1:47:03] and those that you have you are
[1:47:05] committing now i know that you're
[1:47:07] planning to commit in the future
[1:47:10] are all
[1:47:11] forgiven
[1:47:14] whosoever that has bought this
[1:47:17] indulgence
[1:47:19] will not
[1:47:20] need to do penance anymore
[1:47:25] whosoever has done this
[1:47:30] no problem
[1:47:32] in the name of the church and in the
[1:47:33] name of the pope
[1:47:35] out the tent
[1:47:37] then people would say but the
[1:47:40] thing was expensive
[1:47:43] 30 million
[1:47:44] bring five brave people
[1:47:47] [Music]
[1:48:00] became so rich
[1:48:03] from those things
[1:48:04] it was meant to make the church the
[1:48:07] system rich
[1:48:08] but also to take people to help because
[1:48:11] imagine if you're trolling like that you
[1:48:13] only buy this one
[1:48:15] because remember the pope
[1:48:17] is the one those people behalf of christ
[1:48:20] so whatever it is that he says it is
[1:48:22] done
[1:48:23] so
[1:48:24] but the one who says yeah and john tesla
[1:48:26] came to sell indulgences for sin
[1:48:29] luther had no choice but to rise up
[1:48:31] against this anti-scriptural teachings
[1:48:34] remember ludha was
[1:48:37] already a priest in this same church as
[1:48:39] we are very very high
[1:48:40] first he thundered from the pulpit
[1:48:44] against
[1:48:51] and things that are wrong
[1:48:53] not just to stand for them and you know
[1:48:55] play it around and fear to speak when i
[1:48:57] preach about this mr peace
[1:48:59] it means uh
[1:49:01] i wanted to mention yes unfortunately
[1:49:03] you will feel bad oh oh oh brother you
[1:49:05] know joel will hate me
[1:49:07] let me tell you about the cold man don't
[1:49:09] fear those things as long as this is the
[1:49:11] word you thunder and
[1:49:28] so this man found that on the pulpit
[1:49:31] against this and the scripture teaching
[1:49:33] first he farted from the pulpit against
[1:49:35] the street and then he wrote and then he
[1:49:39] wrote his famous 95 is
[1:49:42] neither five pesos was like 95 reasons
[1:49:44] or
[1:49:45] or a list of things
[1:49:47] that the church had done wrong and why
[1:49:49] he was exiting it
[1:49:51] he put it on a paper and he said this is
[1:49:54] the reason why
[1:49:55] which on october the 1st 1517 he nailed
[1:49:59] to the door of the castle church
[1:50:02] all right that was amazing it wasn't it
[1:50:06] in a short time germany was ablaze and
[1:50:08] the reformation was on now let it be
[1:50:10] remembered that martin luther was not
[1:50:12] the only one who had protested the roman
[1:50:14] catholic church
[1:50:15] he was but one of many
[1:50:17] others had denied the popes their
[1:50:19] self-granted temporal and spiritual
[1:50:21] power and even amongst the popes there
[1:50:23] were minor temporary reforms
[1:50:26] yes there were many others by the way
[1:50:29] like he said that
[1:50:30] was not the only there were others
[1:50:33] there was actually john wickliffe said
[1:50:35] something when they were going to burn
[1:50:37] him he said you are kidding me now but
[1:50:40] 100 years from now there is going to
[1:50:41] come someone that you'll not be able to
[1:50:43] kill
[1:50:44] and it was martin luther one of exactly
[1:50:47] 100 years later
[1:50:48] he came on the scene and he started the
[1:50:50] defamation movement
[1:50:52] and they couldn't kill one of their own
[1:50:55] oh my god lord
[1:50:57] because rules are people on the left
[1:50:59] rule that were the ones burning people
[1:51:02] but now he is the one going on the side
[1:51:04] of the back of the ones going to be
[1:51:06] banned and they burned him
[1:51:10] they couldn't have banned him
[1:51:12] because he was a general manager
[1:51:15] they wouldn't sign him
[1:51:17] because they were saying they don't know
[1:51:19] the scripture and they are above yahweh
[1:51:21] they are like preaching headaches but
[1:51:23] this is one of their own they are
[1:51:25] betrayed beliefs
[1:51:26] everything you say is from the convict
[1:51:30] so how can you now tell us that you
[1:51:32] abandoned him because of heresy so which
[1:51:34] means the church itself is heretic
[1:51:38] they did not touch him
[1:51:40] raised issues but in the case of luther
[1:51:43] god's time was ripe for a definite move
[1:51:45] that would be the beginning of the
[1:51:46] restoration of the church to an
[1:51:48] outpouring of the holy ghost at a much
[1:51:50] later date
[1:51:52] now martin luther himself was a
[1:51:54] sensitive spirit-filled christian
[1:51:57] he was definitely a man of the word for
[1:51:59] he not only had a profound passion to
[1:52:01] study it but to make it available to all
[1:52:03] in order that all might live by it
[1:52:06] he translated the new testament and gave
[1:52:08] it to the people
[1:52:09] this laborious work he did himself
[1:52:12] correcting a passage as much as twenty
[1:52:13] times
[1:52:15] he gathered around him a group of hebrew
[1:52:16] scholars amongst whom were jews and
[1:52:18] translated the old testament
[1:52:21] this monumental work of luther is still
[1:52:24] the work upon which all successive works
[1:52:26] of the scripture in germany have rested
[1:52:29] he was a mighty preacher and teacher of
[1:52:31] the word and insisted especially in his
[1:52:33] first years of public eminence that the
[1:52:35] word was the soul criterion
[1:52:38] thus he was against works as a means of
[1:52:40] salvation and baptism as a means of
[1:52:42] regeneration
[1:52:43] he taught the mediation of christ apart
[1:52:45] from man as was the original and
[1:52:48] did you know that the first bible to be
[1:52:49] translated properly was in germany
[1:52:52] in german
[1:52:53] in german in germany
[1:53:04] the only reason why we don't read the
[1:53:06] german translation
[1:53:08] is obvious
[1:53:09] because we don't read yemen
[1:53:12] and the only reason why that's that
[1:53:14] translation was not the one translated
[1:53:17] it's because
[1:53:18] yemen was not the one which colonized
[1:53:20] the whole world
[1:53:22] it was written
[1:53:24] and of course this movement of luda was
[1:53:26] also
[1:53:27] starting to eat up
[1:53:29] england
[1:53:31] and a man who translated the english
[1:53:33] version
[1:53:34] was
[1:53:35] william tinder william tinder was a man
[1:53:40] that was accused of heresy and they said
[1:53:42] he's following buddha
[1:53:44] this is that we are reading now about
[1:53:46] so that's why they say ah he is
[1:53:48] following he is
[1:54:06] network and they will take him now they
[1:54:09] are coming they can't
[1:54:10] escape they fight when he is ready to go
[1:54:12] ah he goes to another place he continues
[1:54:14] his work imagine
[1:54:17] and finally his own person betrayed you
[1:54:22] and they banned he
[1:54:24] died
[1:54:26] but he did not die in vain then we have
[1:54:28] the kgb
[1:54:29] version
[1:54:31] this bible you know what is called king
[1:54:34] james
[1:54:35] version
[1:54:38] sometimes we have things that we don't
[1:54:39] know why
[1:54:41] say the names of all these cars
[1:54:43] is the names of people there
[1:54:46] it is the name of a person
[1:54:50] they
[1:54:51] including these other cars
[1:54:53] toyota the name of a person
[1:54:56] therefore
[1:54:57] king james version don't just think it
[1:54:59] is just something which came from heaven
[1:55:01] they were the king museums james is a
[1:55:03] king
[1:55:05] he was a king of great britain
[1:55:08] the king of england rather
[1:55:10] and he was the one who authorized
[1:55:14] read this thing open your kingdom
[1:55:16] smashing
[1:55:19] this is the only bible
[1:55:22] containing the older new
[1:55:24] testament
[1:55:25] authorized
[1:55:27] king james
[1:55:30] version have you seen that why is it
[1:55:32] authorized
[1:55:38] at that time
[1:55:39] you would not read any bible
[1:55:42] they were only support no one was ever
[1:55:44] allowed to read the bibles
[1:55:46] but in england
[1:55:49] when
[1:55:50] this man after his death
[1:55:53] he james i think one of his wives or
[1:55:55] someone was reading and following this
[1:55:56] man so he told him after all his
[1:55:59] writings were not healthy
[1:56:01] so why if they are not heretic
[1:56:03] why has it not been a published decision
[1:56:05] because the united states said i don't
[1:56:08] care
[1:56:09] as long as no heroes is found in it
[1:56:12] published in all the churches in england
[1:56:15] and in every church in england you are
[1:56:18] missing out on a very important point
[1:56:19] i'm giving you strong history here now
[1:56:22] in every church in england on the pool
[1:56:24] bridge there was a very large version of
[1:56:27] it like this one
[1:56:30] yeah
[1:56:32] there was a very large version of this
[1:56:34] black kingdom's version bible like this
[1:56:36] one
[1:56:37] peeled
[1:56:38] on the church on the church pulpit
[1:56:41] always there
[1:56:42] when the priest comes and the preacher
[1:56:44] just opens like that
[1:56:47] it was always there since i was
[1:56:48] threatened to be read all over england
[1:56:51] the king has spoken
[1:56:53] and ever since then of course you know
[1:56:55] england colonized most of the world
[1:56:58] so all of us
[1:56:59] who were under the domain of england
[1:57:02] received this version including here in
[1:57:04] uganda we read it today
[1:57:07] but this bible came by many people who
[1:57:10] sacrificed their blood and they died
[1:57:12] there are four
[1:57:13] the kgb is the right version because it
[1:57:16] survived fires
[1:57:17] wrong
[1:57:18] it survived you know you know all the
[1:57:21] brothers
[1:57:22] tomorrow just time it survived it
[1:57:25] it survived it in order for you and i to
[1:57:27] get it
[1:57:28] it is saying that
[1:57:30] william tender
[1:57:31] he will do
[1:57:33] print
[1:57:34] the bibles
[1:57:36] put them in how do they call these
[1:57:38] things
[1:57:40] these things of the
[1:57:42] uh
[1:57:44] the food of
[1:57:46] horses
[1:57:49] we don't know it here
[1:57:51] of course you don't even know what the
[1:57:52] sign will do
[1:57:54] so
[1:57:55] you would have put it there
[1:57:57] they can make a solid or whatever
[1:58:00] you would put those bibles there and
[1:58:01] they would buy you would transport them
[1:58:03] like that
[1:58:04] but sometimes the catholic church was
[1:58:06] the one buying it
[1:58:08] in these guys
[1:58:11] so what they would do
[1:58:12] they would buy it from him he sends it
[1:58:15] to them they burn it
[1:58:17] and they will buy a mass quantity so
[1:58:20] they kept it busy
[1:58:22] only to buy it
[1:58:24] and if you say
[1:58:25] you would sell to them
[1:58:28] but they would burn it but you would use
[1:58:30] that same money to produce more
[1:58:34] you
[1:58:35] produce that same money
[1:58:36] uh to produce more yeah
[1:58:40] so you would use that money to produce
[1:58:43] more bibles
[1:58:45] and those bibles that he produced he
[1:58:48] would sell again to them
[1:58:51] and he would get
[1:59:03] excuse me
[1:59:10] all right
[1:59:12] okay come back come back
[1:59:14] something happening here all right so i
[1:59:16] was saying that uh
[1:59:18] you would use
[1:59:20] that money to but to make more bibles
[1:59:22] they would buy they would use that
[1:59:23] monthly bible you understand
[1:59:25] until they gave up
[1:59:27] but he never gave up until he was killed
[1:59:30] but those bibles survived until we have
[1:59:32] them today
[1:59:33] hallelujah
[1:59:35] so these bibles came from very very far
[1:59:38] but the first translations of the bible
[1:59:39] were in german but it was also not very
[1:59:41] perfect
[1:59:42] i think william gina did a better job
[1:59:45] anyway
[1:59:46] uh but the first information the
[1:59:48] reformation started in german
[1:59:50] that's why even the missionaries the
[1:59:52] very very first missionaries here
[1:59:55] really many of them were from german you
[1:59:57] know
[1:59:58] because they received
[2:00:02] the
[2:00:02] move of god
[2:00:04] first he was a man given to much prayer
[2:00:06] and had learned that the more work he
[2:00:08] had to do
[2:00:09] and the more sorely he was pressed for
[2:00:11] time the more of his time he gave to god
[2:00:14] in prayer in order to ensure
[2:00:15] satisfactory results
[2:00:18] he knew what it was to battle with the
[2:00:20] devil and it is said that satan one day
[2:00:22] visibly appeared to him and he flung the
[2:00:24] ink well at him bidding him go
[2:00:27] another time two fanatics came to him to
[2:00:29] induce him to join with them in
[2:00:30] banishing all priests and bibles
[2:00:33] he discerned the spirit within them and
[2:00:35] sent them off
[2:00:37] it is recorded of dr martin luther in
[2:00:39] sours history volume 3 page 406 that he
[2:00:43] was
[2:00:44] a prophet evangelist speaker in tongues
[2:00:47] interpreter in one person endowed with
[2:00:50] all nine gifts of the spirit
[2:00:53] what stirred his heart
[2:00:54] and he didn't know that as much as he
[2:00:57] was endowed with all these gifts of the
[2:00:58] spirit
[2:01:00] he himself
[2:01:01] was not teaching the books of the holy
[2:01:03] spirit
[2:01:07] because he was only teaching once
[2:01:10] he was teaching rather faith
[2:01:13] he was sitting faith in christ
[2:01:16] but to fulfill the other part
[2:01:19] to fulfill the other part of
[2:01:23] the messenger you remember the the
[2:01:27] the pattern that
[2:01:29] god used or by the bottom used rather
[2:01:32] to
[2:01:33] determine what
[2:01:35] the messenger was in every generation
[2:01:38] what was that pattern
[2:01:40] number one
[2:01:50] yeah of course but that's not the
[2:01:51] pattern that's not the pattern there
[2:01:52] must be a pattern all through the edges
[2:01:54] that every messenger true messenger must
[2:01:56] have
[2:01:59] yes
[2:02:05] exactly like the fast
[2:02:08] yes paul was the first messenger
[2:02:11] and
[2:02:11] i was poor paul was a man of the world
[2:02:14] and paul was the man of the spirit as
[2:02:16] well
[2:02:17] so that pattern must be all through
[2:02:20] those messengers
[2:02:22] or at least one who was closest
[2:02:25] what paul had we can say in that
[2:02:27] generation he is the one
[2:02:30] you understand so here he brings in that
[2:02:32] idea that he was a man of the world but
[2:02:34] of course
[2:02:36] excuse me also he was a prophet he was
[2:02:38] an evangelist he was a speaker in
[2:02:40] tongues he's a preacher as a man who
[2:02:42] wasn't even you know knowing about the
[2:02:44] gift of the spirit like like we know you
[2:02:45] today the voicemail like we know it
[2:02:47] today he was interpreting town and
[2:02:50] speaking in tongues
[2:02:52] and you who is supposed to be the omega
[2:02:54] bride who knows much more than rude and
[2:02:57] him
[2:02:57] you can't even speak in times
[2:03:00] let alone laugh of those who are
[2:03:01] speaking them
[2:03:03] you'll feel sorry for yourself
[2:03:06] so he was a speaker in terms of the
[2:03:08] prayer he was
[2:03:10] he was endured with all nine spirit
[2:03:13] the gift of the spirit
[2:03:15] right
[2:03:16] you remember what i did for you on
[2:03:18] sunday uh on wednesday but i'm saying
[2:03:21] what's the lowest gift that there is
[2:03:25] the smallest gift whereby when you get
[2:03:28] you said now i've started
[2:03:31] it's the small one of the smaller it is
[2:03:33] smaller smallest
[2:03:35] you understand there are nice spiritual
[2:03:36] groups but there are none of this
[2:03:40] so by the way the course is major on it
[2:03:42] as if it is there
[2:03:44] real deal
[2:03:45] that's really not the real deal
[2:03:48] amen
[2:03:52] but that is not to say
[2:03:54] that you
[2:04:01] by the holy ghost and which was the
[2:04:03] little green chute that signified that
[2:04:05] truth was coming back to the church as
[2:04:07] it was known at pentecost was the
[2:04:09] doctrine of justification
[2:04:11] salvation by grace apart from works
[2:04:14] i recognize that dr luther did not
[2:04:16] believe only and preach only
[2:04:18] justification
[2:04:20] but that was his major theme as indeed
[2:04:22] it had to be for that is the basic
[2:04:23] doctrine of the truth of the word
[2:04:26] he will be forever known as the
[2:04:27] instrument in the hand of god who
[2:04:29] revived this truth
[2:04:31] he was the fifth messenger and his
[2:04:33] message was
[2:04:34] the just shall live by faith
[2:04:37] surely we admit that he knew and did
[2:04:39] teach that we are to go from faith to
[2:04:41] faith
[2:04:42] his marvelous understanding of
[2:04:44] sovereignty election predestination and
[2:04:47] other truths show him to be a great man
[2:04:49] in the word
[2:04:50] yet i say again as do historians god
[2:04:53] used him to bring to the people god's
[2:04:55] standard against works the just shall
[2:04:58] live by faith
[2:05:00] now as i mentioned already
[2:05:02] this age has been called by the
[2:05:04] historians the period of reformation
[2:05:06] that is exactly right that is what it
[2:05:09] was
[2:05:10] it had to be that for martin luther was
[2:05:12] a reformer not a prophet
[2:05:14] now i know the history book calls him a
[2:05:16] prophet but it doesn't mean that the
[2:05:18] history book is right for there is no
[2:05:20] record of martin luther qualifying as a
[2:05:22] true prophet of god in the grand
[2:05:24] scriptural sense of that word
[2:05:26] he was a fine teacher with some of the
[2:05:28] manifestations of the spirit in his life
[2:05:30] and we praise god for that
[2:05:32] so he was not able to lead the church
[2:05:34] back to the whole truth as would a man
[2:05:36] like the apostle paul who was both
[2:05:38] apostle and prophet
[2:05:41] now as time went on we find a great
[2:05:43] change in the way he conducted the
[2:05:45] affairs in which he was involved
[2:05:47] at first he had been so gentle so
[2:05:49] fearless so patient and constantly
[2:05:51] waiting on god to work out the problems
[2:05:54] but then vast numbers began to come to
[2:05:56] his banner their purpose was not a truly
[2:05:59] spiritual one
[2:06:00] rather they had political motivations
[2:06:03] they wanted to break the yoke of the
[2:06:04] pope
[2:06:05] they disliked sending money to rome
[2:06:08] fanatics rose up soon he was dragged
[2:06:10] into political affairs and decisions
[2:06:12] that actually lay outside the realm of
[2:06:14] the church except that the church
[2:06:16] through prayer preaching and conduct
[2:06:18] might set up a standard to be heated
[2:06:21] these problems of politics mounted until
[2:06:23] he was forced into an untenable position
[2:06:25] of mediating between lords and peasants
[2:06:28] his decisions were so wrong that an
[2:06:30] uprising took place and thousands were
[2:06:32] killed
[2:06:33] he meant well
[2:06:34] but once he had let himself be entangled
[2:06:36] again in a church state gospel he had to
[2:06:39] reap the whirlwind
[2:06:41] but for all that god used martin luther
[2:06:44] let it not be said that his intentions
[2:06:46] were wrong
[2:06:47] let it only be said that his judgment
[2:06:49] failed
[2:06:51] truly if the lutherans could get back to
[2:06:53] his teaching and serve god as this
[2:06:54] gracious brother served him then that
[2:06:56] people would surely be a credit and
[2:06:58] praise to the great god and savior jesus
[2:07:01] christ
[2:07:03] the salutation
[2:07:07] hallelujah
[2:07:09] i think we shall stop there for today is
[2:07:11] there anyone with a question
[2:07:16] yes
[2:07:19] i'm asking myself that
[2:07:21] i was martin luther king
[2:07:28] okay
[2:07:31] uh
[2:07:32] that why was martin luther not able to
[2:07:35] preach the whole truth
[2:07:36] yet the whole truth was in the bible
[2:07:39] because it was not yet the time
[2:07:41] for the whole truth
[2:07:43] to be preached
[2:07:45] just like
[2:07:47] you saw a seed
[2:07:51] you cannot say
[2:07:52] after
[2:07:53] two weeks
[2:07:54] why cut that old why can't that seed
[2:07:57] bear a wall
[2:07:59] grain
[2:08:01] yet the life is in it
[2:08:04] because it's not yet the time
[2:08:06] so that is times and there is
[2:08:08] seasons
[2:08:10] so we notice that the time of blood
[2:08:12] actually by the banana talks about it
[2:08:14] it talks about it as a plant has
[2:08:16] different parts of it
[2:08:18] you know there's the
[2:08:20] seed time
[2:08:21] then i'll put the transfer that they
[2:08:24] update for those things
[2:08:28] whatever personal person
[2:08:30] yeah
[2:08:34] the parts of the growth of uh
[2:08:36] that's a maze or
[2:08:38] or wheat
[2:08:40] there's the tassel that is there
[2:08:45] you don't know nothing
[2:08:47] and you're an agriculture
[2:09:02] so
[2:09:03] let me read for you what it says down
[2:09:05] here
[2:09:06] okay
[2:09:17] okay let me let me get this
[2:09:19] quote here for you
[2:09:22] and be able
[2:09:25] uh be able to read it out for you
[2:09:27] i'm sure it will be able to bless
[2:09:30] you answer your question
[2:09:35] okay let's prepare this give me some
[2:09:37] moment
[2:09:40] to find it
[2:10:02] okay
[2:10:14] okay i'm not getting it as i want it
[2:10:17] then with another question as i find
[2:10:20] this quote
[2:10:25] yes
[2:10:26] yes sister go ahead
[2:10:28] but man is a rubbish a lot of voice
[2:10:39] people call the messengers of the other
[2:10:45] the messengers of other church ages
[2:10:48] were they also vindicated
[2:10:51] can someone answer that question
[2:10:56] with explanation not just yes or no
[2:11:07] anyone who can answer that
[2:11:22] to answer that here
[2:11:47] then
[2:11:50] [Music]
[2:11:59] okay another brother who can do that you
[2:12:02] can also answer
[2:12:04] the more clarity for the system
[2:12:08] i think from the beginning i've been
[2:12:11] studying about messengers
[2:12:15] so that they all had the manifestation
[2:12:17] of
[2:12:18] the power of good
[2:12:47] but he's talking about the vindication
[2:12:50] like we can say
[2:12:51] can you first of all discuss on the
[2:12:53] vindications of the means of alabama
[2:12:57] and we discuss it when he was
[2:13:24] no
[2:13:25] she's not speaking to me she's speaking
[2:13:26] to all of us so i need us to have a
[2:13:28] discussion here so i want you to be
[2:13:31] active rather respond respond just
[2:13:35] run away
[2:14:10] that cloud that came
[2:14:12] the voice talked from heaven and say
[2:14:15] that
[2:14:15] as john the baptist was sent for under
[2:14:17] first coming
[2:14:20] so this one
[2:14:22] your message is for around the
[2:14:35] was on his head when they took his
[2:14:41] and paul
[2:14:43] was also vindicated with the beloved
[2:14:45] fire
[2:14:46] i think these are the only stages
[2:14:57] what do you say about that
[2:15:01] for me
[2:15:21] sent by god
[2:15:24] in their ages
[2:15:27] but the prophets we are seeing here
[2:15:29] where paul and
[2:15:32] brother branham
[2:16:09] yes
[2:16:25] your voices please
[2:16:26] make it big as we read it there's a
[2:16:29] certain church page
[2:16:40] hey
[2:16:53] try to end up
[2:17:01] they close the gates and the power of
[2:17:03] god can
[2:17:06] show that
[2:17:08] for this part of them
[2:17:11] i
[2:17:12] saw a kill
[2:17:17] when he prayed
[2:17:34] okay
[2:17:35] now
[2:17:36] we have uh been reading
[2:17:40] all the
[2:17:42] uh
[2:17:44] the things that we have been reading the
[2:17:45] message
[2:17:46] actually
[2:17:48] i don't know about each of you but from
[2:17:50] whatever we have been reading
[2:17:52] we have been reading i mean every age we
[2:17:55] have been reading the vindications of
[2:17:57] that message
[2:17:59] go back and read
[2:18:00] on every
[2:18:02] uh
[2:18:03] church age when he brings a messenger
[2:18:07] the next thing he does he brings the
[2:18:09] indication that prove that that message
[2:18:11] was the message
[2:18:12] not because he picked him but because
[2:18:16] there were certain things that were
[2:18:18] identical
[2:18:19] only to that messenger that made him
[2:18:23] stand out among the rest
[2:18:25] for example do you remember
[2:18:28] the messenger
[2:18:30] in the first age who was it
[2:18:33] i mean in the second age rather
[2:18:36] iranians
[2:18:38] and then they said iranians was the
[2:18:40] student of wu
[2:18:44] iranians was a student of
[2:18:48] politica
[2:18:49] and polycarp was a student of
[2:18:53] oh
[2:18:55] come on say it
[2:18:57] john
[2:18:58] so
[2:18:59] john is the honorable of the book of
[2:19:01] revelation
[2:19:04] according to you
[2:19:05] who should have been
[2:19:08] the true messenger of that age
[2:19:10] if we are to to see the one who was
[2:19:13] closest to the apostles
[2:19:16] who should have been
[2:19:33] john was the apostle
[2:19:34] john
[2:19:36] after john then polika
[2:19:38] polycarp was a student of the word
[2:19:41] of john
[2:19:44] but john and polycarp lived in a
[2:19:46] different generation thereafter right
[2:19:49] so we are looking after john
[2:19:51] who should have been
[2:19:53] the message
[2:19:56] why
[2:19:59] you were so close to john
[2:20:00] he learned from john you understand
[2:20:04] but
[2:20:05] here comes the prophet the spirit of god
[2:20:07] comes in him and he says
[2:20:08] yeah he betrays about political
[2:20:11] people was a great man of god god used
[2:20:14] him you know you know what he did and
[2:20:16] then he says what did he do
[2:20:25] what happened when did he pray for that
[2:20:36] yes
[2:20:37] so monica but why was that a messenger
[2:20:54] he was a man of god but it was not a
[2:20:56] vindicated message
[2:20:58] sister what is vindication vindication
[2:21:01] is something that happens in your life
[2:21:03] that proves you are who you say you are
[2:21:07] that vindication is in two ways sister
[2:21:10] one the word of god should be preached
[2:21:13] purely
[2:21:14] through your life
[2:21:17] and it should be lived also
[2:21:19] and number two
[2:21:21] there should be signs and one has to
[2:21:22] prove you are you say
[2:21:25] who you are you understand
[2:21:27] so in polycarp polycarp was having the
[2:21:29] manifestation right
[2:21:31] he was having the move of god in his
[2:21:32] life right he was a servant of god right
[2:21:35] you're not answering me yes yes but
[2:21:38] polycarp was leaning towards the
[2:21:41] organization
[2:21:43] ah elizabeth are you with us
[2:21:46] monica was leaning towards
[2:21:50] the organization
[2:21:51] and because he was leaning towards the
[2:21:53] organization
[2:21:55] the spirit of god rejects him as a
[2:21:57] messenger
[2:21:59] but recognizes him as one of them that
[2:22:02] god uses that generation
[2:22:04] you understand yes
[2:22:07] because the paul never leaned towards
[2:22:09] organization
[2:22:10] how come that another messenger would do
[2:22:12] it
[2:22:13] you understand for example the first
[2:22:16] messenger who was it
[2:22:19] poor why not peter
[2:22:24] was that he a servant of god
[2:22:27] but he was not a vindicated messenger
[2:22:29] for that generation
[2:22:31] why
[2:22:32] because peter
[2:22:34] we find that peter
[2:22:36] was one who did not even have a clear
[2:22:38] understanding of the word
[2:22:40] of the hour
[2:22:42] peter was thinking that everyone has to
[2:22:44] be circumcised like the jews
[2:22:46] peter was thinking the gospel is only
[2:22:48] for the jews
[2:22:49] then i will now preach among the
[2:22:51] gentiles his uncircumcised whatever
[2:22:53] christians
[2:22:55] peter was having that idea
[2:22:57] so even when god told him what preacher
[2:22:58] said what you mean i should be
[2:23:00] questioned
[2:23:01] shut up how can you call an agreement
[2:23:03] with us please
[2:23:05] so peter was not having a full
[2:23:07] revelation and understanding of the word
[2:23:09] of the heart of that hour
[2:23:10] but paul did so paul was vindicated
[2:23:13] not only because of the peer of fire
[2:23:16] don't look at medication as the
[2:23:18] supernatural only
[2:23:20] look at medication in many ways
[2:23:22] not many ways but two ways
[2:23:24] the full word of the hour number one and
[2:23:26] number two the supernatural
[2:23:30] so when you see in paul's life there was
[2:23:32] the supernatural just like it was in
[2:23:34] peter's life also people have a
[2:23:35] supernatural
[2:23:37] but
[2:23:38] when it comes to the full knowledge of
[2:23:40] the world of the day it was now
[2:23:44] all within
[2:23:46] when it comes to the second edge same
[2:23:47] thing
[2:23:48] the start edge same thing fourth same
[2:23:50] thing
[2:23:51] fifth same thing there were other men
[2:23:53] that god used
[2:23:54] not only much more
[2:23:57] but why does the holy spirit picked
[2:23:59] rudolph he had the full word of that
[2:24:01] generation
[2:24:03] the word of the hour
[2:24:04] when we said the word of the hour it
[2:24:06] means that it is more
[2:24:07] just like
[2:24:08] he said luther also preached faith
[2:24:11] that
[2:24:13] growing from faith to faith
[2:24:15] not only faith period but faith
[2:24:18] god god continues defeating himself
[2:24:20] further believed in that
[2:24:21] he knew what he had was little but he
[2:24:23] knew more was coming just like peter
[2:24:26] knew paul knew that more was coming
[2:24:29] he said actually even if it doesn't say
[2:24:30] the salvation shall be revealed
[2:24:38] so we see that each of these messengers
[2:24:41] we have vindicated messengers
[2:24:43] vindication is how the word of god
[2:24:47] the pure the word approaching it
[2:24:50] then the regression they received for
[2:24:52] that power for the question for that
[2:24:53] power
[2:24:54] like paul had it in the foundational way
[2:24:59] or not
[2:25:00] then when it comes
[2:25:02] to the others then also the other thing
[2:25:04] that they had was the supernatural
[2:25:06] so haven't we seen in every messenger
[2:25:09] something supernatural that was
[2:25:11] happening in their life and in their
[2:25:12] ministry system
[2:25:14] we didn't see that that is the
[2:25:15] vindication
[2:25:17] but we only know so much details about
[2:25:20] badapanam because it's in our generation
[2:25:23] but the others if you dig you can also
[2:25:25] find more
[2:25:27] but we don't want to
[2:25:28] go digging one by one being digging
[2:25:31] because that's not our generation we are
[2:25:33] in another generation
[2:25:35] just like martin luther preached very
[2:25:36] many good sermons
[2:25:38] have you listened to them have you ever
[2:25:40] listened to elements of your mother
[2:25:42] and you wonder why are we even calling
[2:25:44] him a messenger
[2:25:46] but if you dig them you'll find them
[2:25:49] like you join with it the one we are
[2:25:50] going to come to today the next day of
[2:25:52] philadelphia
[2:25:53] june weasley was a very good man and a
[2:25:56] very good servant of everybody very many
[2:25:58] good messages when we reach him i'll
[2:26:00] even tell you which message you should
[2:26:01] listen to
[2:26:03] very very good you see
[2:26:05] but we don't dig those things why
[2:26:06] because this is not our age we're in
[2:26:08] another age now
[2:26:10] hallelujah
[2:26:11] but for you to be perfected well you
[2:26:13] need to also know the other concepts of
[2:26:15] the other
[2:26:16] the messages of the other ages before us
[2:26:18] because we are the omega bride we are
[2:26:20] the ones finishing finishing it up
[2:26:23] yes
[2:26:24] concluded
[2:26:28] everyone with another question
[2:26:33] yes
[2:26:34] no question
[2:26:36] everything fine
[2:26:39] you have a question
[2:26:41] oh uh as we are concluding i rather ask
[2:26:44] the question i'd rather give you this
[2:26:45] quote from the leadership
[2:26:51] and i want to
[2:26:53] read this and then we shall
[2:26:57] uh we shall
[2:26:59] you you might need to listen to this
[2:27:00] whole message
[2:27:02] so you take note of it
[2:27:05] leadership says the first call of which
[2:27:10] the bridegroom had to fall into the
[2:27:12] earth in order to rise again
[2:27:15] when you when you when you saw a seed
[2:27:17] of wheat
[2:27:19] what happens to it
[2:27:22] it dies after it dies
[2:27:26] the germinates
[2:27:29] it grows after it grows
[2:27:34] but it must grow to maturity before
[2:27:41] i'm going to request those who are
[2:27:43] online to please mute
[2:27:46] mute yourself at all times
[2:27:48] okay
[2:27:49] so
[2:27:50] the first call of wheat now listen to
[2:27:52] this very well
[2:27:54] the first corner of wheat the bridegroom
[2:27:57] had to fall into the earth in order to
[2:27:59] rise again
[2:28:01] so the first bride
[2:28:03] that was born at pentecost
[2:28:07] he had to go
[2:28:08] through the darker ages like any other
[2:28:10] seed
[2:28:11] everybody
[2:28:13] you remember that
[2:28:14] that kind of pentecost
[2:28:19] it had to go to the
[2:28:21] ground
[2:28:25] i i think there is someone who is not
[2:28:26] muting i'll remove you so make sure that
[2:28:29] you you're muting yourself please
[2:28:31] so it says so did the first bride that
[2:28:34] was born at pentecost he had to go
[2:28:36] through that dark ages
[2:28:38] like any other seed everybody
[2:28:41] they have to die
[2:28:43] they must do it
[2:28:45] but it started
[2:28:47] sprouting again
[2:28:49] in ruler are you
[2:28:54] the seed was by that pentecost
[2:28:56] huh
[2:28:58] and it died
[2:29:00] and then they started sprouting again
[2:29:03] bring back a text i can't see
[2:29:12] look at what you see on your screen
[2:29:21] okay
[2:29:22] it says
[2:29:23] but it started sprouting again in luda
[2:29:26] in the first reformation
[2:29:29] that's where we are now
[2:29:32] that was the only the seed to begin to
[2:29:34] sprout to germinate
[2:29:36] do you expect to see the fruit
[2:29:38] that's why you cannot preach everything
[2:29:41] he continued to baptize the baptising
[2:29:43] babies he continued there because the
[2:29:45] seed is just sprouting
[2:29:52] in the first reformation
[2:29:54] it did not look like the seed that went
[2:29:57] in
[2:29:58] but it was the light of that day
[2:30:02] are you getting it
[2:30:04] the stalker then went on into the tassel
[2:30:08] that is the
[2:30:09] those things that come huh but the maze
[2:30:11] is like on the maze for example
[2:30:16] whizzy because the weasley the tassel i
[2:30:19] will show you a picture here
[2:30:22] when you see
[2:30:24] into the wheat
[2:30:25] when it comes forth the corner with a
[2:30:27] man that's raised weak
[2:30:30] you go out and see that wheat foam in
[2:30:33] there it just looks like exactly like
[2:30:36] the grain
[2:30:37] but it won't take a twist and sit down
[2:30:39] and take
[2:30:40] uh
[2:30:43] and take that week and open it up there
[2:30:46] is no green in there at all
[2:30:50] that was weasley now
[2:30:52] there was no grain
[2:30:55] it is just a shark
[2:30:58] and then what it is formed there
[2:31:01] to hold
[2:31:02] the grain
[2:31:04] and then the first thing you know the
[2:31:06] lights that the the life that left the
[2:31:09] stove to go into the tassel if you let
[2:31:11] the pasta to go in the shack it removes
[2:31:13] the shark and goes into the weight
[2:31:15] three stages see
[2:31:18] of it and then forms the wheat outside
[2:31:21] of the three stages luda weasley peters
[2:31:24] you're getting it now
[2:31:26] just exactly see no doubt you can't
[2:31:28] interrupt nature
[2:31:30] hallelujah
[2:31:32] and i i'm let me share this
[2:31:34] with you
[2:31:35] of
[2:31:36] uh the the wheat you know
[2:31:40] uh
[2:31:41] you can see that there
[2:31:43] since i don't ask the question can you
[2:31:44] see
[2:31:45] and uh
[2:31:46] you see
[2:31:48] that which
[2:31:50] for example here i have maze well it's
[2:31:51] an israel but it's the same as
[2:31:54] the
[2:31:55] uh the
[2:31:57] what what we are running here you see
[2:31:59] the seed
[2:32:00] is planted here dies and then goes
[2:32:03] through the stalk
[2:32:04] eh
[2:32:06] of course i'm talking about this is a
[2:32:07] maze
[2:32:08] but if it is a wheat the wheat will be
[2:32:11] up here not down here
[2:32:13] all right
[2:32:14] so the tassel this is the tassel it will
[2:32:17] be the castle out of the tassel then it
[2:32:19] will come what
[2:32:20] there will come the the shark after the
[2:32:23] shark because that is the shack
[2:32:25] but the shark then you produce the seed
[2:32:27] that's the seed now where are we we are
[2:32:30] at the time of the ripening of the seed
[2:32:32] where the seed is going to be now
[2:32:33] collected
[2:32:34] and garneted
[2:32:35] into
[2:32:37] into its place and the shack will be cut
[2:32:40] down and they will be bad
[2:32:43] hallelujah
[2:32:44] so we are at a time of the siege coming
[2:32:48] forth again that's why those people was
[2:32:50] not preaching all
[2:32:52] the doctrine in the right documents
[2:32:53] because that time i know they'd reach
[2:32:54] for the full seed for the full maturity
[2:32:57] of the seed to come we are now in the
[2:32:59] time of the full maturity of the same
[2:33:01] word of god to come back again and you
[2:33:05] are the reason
[2:33:07] why amen that one has come to mature you
[2:33:10] mature us
[2:33:11] amen we are here for the purpose of the
[2:33:13] maturity of the bride
[2:33:16] hallelujah this matter has not been seen
[2:33:18] anywhere else in the generations before
[2:33:20] us it is in our generation so we are
[2:33:23] that generation
[2:33:25] hallelujah
[2:33:27] so you see how much weight is on your
[2:33:28] assurance
[2:33:30] you're not just a believer you're not
[2:33:31] generation that it's going to symbol you
[2:33:33] eat
[2:33:35] you don't look like you are
[2:33:37] are you a brother
[2:33:40] you may not look like like you are but
[2:33:42] that's it
[2:33:44] this is the time
[2:33:45] that's it
[2:33:47] come forth and and bring forth the same
[2:33:50] seed which was planted in the ground
[2:33:52] when was that ground
[2:33:55] where was that ground
[2:33:58] that pentacles pentecost was that ground
[2:34:01] therefore the true church is that church
[2:34:03] which will bring forth not reproduce but
[2:34:05] bring forth the same thing which was at
[2:34:07] pentecost
[2:34:08] hallelujah
[2:34:10] not as a street no
[2:34:12] pentacles
[2:34:13] barker there because this is now the
[2:34:15] time of the sea to bring forth of its
[2:34:17] kind

[2:34:20] today
[2:34:22] and we shall continue
[2:34:24] on friday next next week the road
