[46:13] Amen. Amen. I'm here to give you the
[46:16] report
[46:20] from our land fund contribution.
[46:24] This is week seven now
[46:28] and this is how we have contributed.
[46:31] Martin Luther contributed 400.
[46:37] My God bless you so much.
[46:41] Then he's followed by
[46:44] 237.
[46:51] Amen. Amen. Followed by by Paul
[46:56] 190,000.
[47:00] May God bless you so much.
[47:04] Then he's followed by William Branham.
[47:08] 160,000.
[47:12] My God bless you so much.
[47:15] Then is followed by Martin
[47:20] &gt;&gt; 100,000.
[47:23] God bless you so much members of Martin.
[47:27] Then he's followed by
[47:31] &gt;&gt; 65,000.
[47:36] Then John Wasley
[47:39] 45,000.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; My God bless you so much for your
[47:44] [Music]
[47:46] from the offering bag.
[47:50] We have 5,000.
[47:55] Amen. Amen. Then we have a total
[48:00] of 1 million
[48:03] 203,000.
[48:08] My God bless you.
[48:11] Uh from the seven weeks
[48:15] we have contributed 9 million
[48:19] 528,000
[48:23] and
[48:27] God bless you.
[48:29] I have one reminder
[48:32] that this this phase two
[48:38] we are more organized than the first
[48:40] phase
[48:43] because the first phase we get we got
[48:45] some challenges
[48:48] most especially when we reach the time
[48:50] when the money is needed
[48:55] most of the money was not paid.
[48:59] And yet we had announced it
[49:03] even now some team leaders did not pay.
[49:09] I hope some people who pledged and they
[49:11] didn't pay the team leaders. So that's
[49:18] so this phase
[49:21] don't pledge if you don't have the money
[49:24] [Music]
[49:25] because for us we need the money late by
[49:28] Monday.
[49:32] We need to deposit it.
[49:35] If you know that you you don't have
[49:40] or you expecting to get next week
[49:43] then that week don't pledge
[49:48] just just give it the other week
[49:51] which you expect to get.
[49:54] So that will help us to get more
[49:56] organized
[49:59] because we make a lot of mistakes
[50:02] if the money does not come inside.
[50:06] So we end up paying what we are not
[50:08] supposed to pay.
[50:12] We pay on our money when when it is not
[50:15] when we find we have deficits.
[50:18] [Music]
[50:23] So may God bless you. Understand that.
[50:28] Amen.
[50:32] Praise the Lord.
[50:34] Amen. Get on our feet.
[50:38] [Music]
[50:42] &gt;&gt; How many are expecting from the Lord
[50:43] this morning?
[50:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Don't forget what you expect is what you
[50:54] praise the Lord. I expect great from the
[50:58] Lord this morning.
[51:01] I believe you as well.
[51:05] Amen.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Amina

[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; And also I just wanted to mention I I I
[1:25:11] forgot unfortunately to give you the
[1:25:13] photos for that. I had I have a lot of
[1:25:14] things I'm going to show you today,
[1:25:19] but I forgot to uh organize the slides
[1:25:21] for the baptism.
[1:25:26] No, I mean like the baptism. We had a
[1:25:27] baptism service this week.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Of course, you don't know because you
[1:25:31] were not there.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; So Hallelujah. So um uh where is uh the
[1:25:37] brethren who are baptized?
[1:25:41] Ah over here. God bless you. God bless
[1:25:44] you sister. Who else
[1:25:47] over there? God bless you.
[1:25:50] Amen. Uh praise God. And you know looks
[1:25:54] like the home sales are very busy
[1:25:58] and the Lord is really giving giving
[1:26:00] them souls.
[1:26:03] Amen. Amen.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; And so we had a wonderful baptism
[1:26:05] service
[1:26:07] with the two sisters
[1:26:09] and I was so surprised to know that this
[1:26:11] sister has been fellowshipping with us
[1:26:13] for more than a year
[1:26:17] and I don't even know of her.
[1:26:20] But I'm so happy that you are finally
[1:26:22] baptized.
[1:26:24] I asked her why do you want to be
[1:26:25] baptized?
[1:26:27] She said she has had been many churches
[1:26:31] but when you know the time she spent
[1:26:34] attending here
[1:26:36] really she felt that we're preaching the
[1:26:38] truth here
[1:26:41] and uh you know sister it's not us it's
[1:26:42] the word
[1:26:45] and we are so grateful that God has
[1:26:46] given us the word in this hour
[1:26:51] and you know all the elect will come.
[1:26:54] Amen. All those who are predestinated to
[1:26:57] life,
[1:26:59] they will come. You are here. So you
[1:27:03] have your brothers and sisters still
[1:27:04] there.
[1:27:06] Let us believe the Lord will bring them
[1:27:08] in.
[1:27:09] Amen. And my precious sister here also
[1:27:11] you know was I think invited by brother
[1:27:14] Dickon Enoch
[1:27:18] in their home cell and um I'm happy to
[1:27:21] see that the Lord is dealing with our
[1:27:22] heart.
[1:27:26] Amen. So last Sunday we had an issue
[1:27:29] with the with the power and I could not
[1:27:31] be able to show you the uh the slides
[1:27:36] the Ethiopia mission report
[1:27:40] and um and I just wanted to do that
[1:27:42] today.
[1:27:45] So when I left here, can you give me the
[1:27:47] f the second slide?
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Um I don't know whether you all can see
[1:27:52] this.
[1:27:56] Okay. Is it possible for these lights to
[1:27:58] be off?
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; If not possible, it's all right.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:06] Even if you remove everything.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's perfect.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; That's perfect.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. So now um we we I left um and I
[1:28:20] went to I went of course by road to the
[1:28:23] airport
[1:28:27] um and then from the airport in took a
[1:28:32] flight
[1:28:35] and um I should also mention that I did
[1:28:38] not have uh funds to go
[1:28:44] I never have funds to go
[1:28:48] whatever I do for the Lord.
[1:28:51] God just surprises me.
[1:28:54] And and so there's a brother who came
[1:28:55] and told me, you know, and you know, he
[1:28:58] had heard of me and
[1:29:02] um he was burdened to uh support me on
[1:29:06] my next trip to Ethiopia.
[1:29:10] So he bought all the tickets
[1:29:13] And that was quite amazing.
[1:29:16] [Applause]
[1:29:17] And that is how it was from day one. The
[1:29:19] first trip we took to Ethiopia, myself
[1:29:21] and my wife, someone bought it.
[1:29:28] And so has it ever been in on every
[1:29:32] trip.
[1:29:34] I I've never begged.
[1:29:38] I just mentioned here
[1:29:40] and you know the Lord somehow provides
[1:29:42] and lays a burden on somebody to
[1:29:44] provide.
[1:29:46] So just it shows you if God is in it he
[1:29:48] will supply.
[1:29:52] So we took a flight to um Adis Ababa
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; which is the capital and from Adis
[1:30:00] we went to um you know we took another
[1:30:03] flight. I didn't even go out of the
[1:30:05] airport.
[1:30:07] just took another flight to Mckll
[1:30:11] which is in northern Ethiopia
[1:30:14] and um about 1 hour and a half
[1:30:19] and then from there you know the
[1:30:22] brothers came picked me up
[1:30:25] and um went by road to Adigrat.
[1:30:30] Adigrat is the little part you see there
[1:30:33] pointed
[1:30:36] right there.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; It's in it's
[1:30:42] one it's like almost the tip of
[1:30:44] Ethiopia.
[1:30:48] It's 100 kilometers from the Red Sea
[1:30:52] just down there. And so that's where we
[1:30:55] the first time we went here was in 2016.
[1:31:00] But my first time to go in this region
[1:31:02] was in 2015.
[1:31:06] And I'm you know I'm writing further
[1:31:08] reports you know the testimonies and on
[1:31:11] the website I will share that and many
[1:31:12] of you who want to get the details
[1:31:14] you'll be able to read.
[1:31:19] And so um that is where we went and we
[1:31:22] were able to meet the brothers.
[1:31:26] Uh we have a few people baptized in that
[1:31:28] area.
[1:31:30] No church yet
[1:31:32] they are the church.
[1:31:34] So the um um can I have the next slide?
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; This is one of the brothers on the left
[1:31:41] here.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Wonderful brother.
[1:31:46] His name is brother Binham
[1:31:48] and um his um his father was the first
[1:31:51] to believe
[1:31:54] some years ago and then he believed too
[1:31:57] and his entire family.
[1:32:00] Uh I should also mention that u uh you
[1:32:03] know there are other believers in the
[1:32:05] city of Mckel
[1:32:07] but at this present time there's no
[1:32:09] fellowship in that entire area
[1:32:13] and we were able to meet these other
[1:32:15] people are Pentecostal ministers.
[1:32:19] we were able to meet, you know, spend
[1:32:21] time meeting Pentecostal ministers
[1:32:25] and also meeting other um the brothers
[1:32:28] and you know, sharing with them and
[1:32:30] encouraging them
[1:32:33] and um you know, brother Okai
[1:32:36] while I was there,
[1:32:38] he disallowed me to pay my hotel
[1:32:43] and all the expenses.
[1:32:47] He's the father of brother Binium.
[1:32:50] He told me I'm hosting you here.
[1:32:53] You are not going to pay a dime.
[1:32:56] I told him I've not come to take.
[1:32:59] I've come to give. He said no. Not a
[1:33:03] chance. You you you know you came to us
[1:33:06] when we were in need.
[1:33:08] It's our time to give back.
[1:33:10] And so he paid all the hotels
[1:33:14] in in as in in that area, all the meals
[1:33:19] and um and on top of that you remember
[1:33:22] that it was announced 250,000 shillings.
[1:33:27] It's 10,000 bill of Ethiopia.
[1:33:30] He said this one take it to the land
[1:33:32] fund.
[1:33:34] We want to participate in that.
[1:33:37] And so I said God bless those brothers.
[1:33:40] and we pray that God gives them a
[1:33:42] ministry there
[1:33:45] and that's the desire. So we are trying
[1:33:46] to do translations
[1:33:49] and um planning on printing a lot of uh
[1:33:52] tracks
[1:33:56] so that we can go and distribute to the
[1:33:58] churches
[1:34:00] and in the contacts we have in that
[1:34:02] area.
[1:34:03] Please pray for
[1:34:07] um as you will seen in the written
[1:34:09] report which I will give
[1:34:13] I've lost about more than a million
[1:34:15] people
[1:34:18] in the recent war which was in that
[1:34:19] area.
[1:34:21] So almost everybody has lost either a
[1:34:23] friend or a brother
[1:34:26] and this family survived narrowly.
[1:34:31] The one that I'm working with
[1:34:35] So we thank God for protecting them.
[1:34:38] I I have a lot to say but because of
[1:34:40] time I will just rush through.
[1:34:44] Okay, give me the next slide
[1:34:46] that looks like a private jet.
[1:34:50] But anyways, it is a flight we took back
[1:34:52] to Adisaba
[1:34:55] and um then from Adisaba
[1:34:59] I took another flight
[1:35:01] to Hawasa.
[1:35:03] That's another city in the south.
[1:35:06] You remember when we were still in the
[1:35:09] other little place,
[1:35:12] we asked you to pray and uh we went
[1:35:15] there
[1:35:17] to Aasa and that's when a church was
[1:35:20] started there
[1:35:23] and because I remember it was during co
[1:35:26] we had about 30 baptized
[1:35:30] in one go and and you know a church
[1:35:31] started there.
[1:35:34] brother, a brother, one of the brothers,
[1:35:36] the first brothers that came to the Lord
[1:35:38] during the time.
[1:35:40] Uh, brother Tesa
[1:35:43] is the current pastor there.
[1:35:47] But in Awasa, we mainly working with
[1:35:49] brother Ephraim
[1:35:52] who had actually invited me to go and
[1:35:53] preach in the ministers conference
[1:35:58] and also preach to the people there.
[1:36:02] Shortly before I arrived there,
[1:36:05] you know, they had, you know, several
[1:36:06] floods in the country
[1:36:09] and um quite they even in the church
[1:36:12] they lost about 12 people.
[1:36:16] So it disorganized a lot of things.
[1:36:20] But nonetheless, still the work of God
[1:36:21] went on.
[1:36:24] Give me the next slide. I had about 12
[1:36:26] people that were supposed to be baptized
[1:36:28] on on my arrival.
[1:36:32] end up just baptizing two of them
[1:36:36] and one of them he's is um she's a wife
[1:36:39] of a minister
[1:36:42] and that is me and brother Ephraim in
[1:36:45] the water
[1:36:47] give me the next slide
[1:36:50] and these are the people uh the the
[1:36:52] sisters that we are baptizing
[1:36:56] Pastor Ephra over there
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; myself and one of the ministers in the
[1:37:01] church.
[1:37:02] Give me the next slide.
[1:37:05] So shortly after that we went to the
[1:37:08] minister's meeting.
[1:37:12] This was a Pentecostal gathering,
[1:37:15] ministers gathering
[1:37:18] and um you know brethren were happy to
[1:37:22] hear the word
[1:37:25] and um I do not know okay the picture is
[1:37:28] a little small
[1:37:32] but you see this brother here
[1:37:36] uh is there's a nethopan brother that
[1:37:39] has come here recently.
[1:37:43] And that is his father. He's one of the
[1:37:46] ministers that the Pentecostal ministers
[1:37:49] that came to the Lord.
[1:37:51] Brother Ephraim has been with him for
[1:37:53] quite a while
[1:37:56] sharing with him. And so in this meeting
[1:37:59] I shared the word
[1:38:01] and I told them
[1:38:03] of course I spoke a lot of things but
[1:38:06] then when it reached on water baptism I
[1:38:08] told him I have an offer after preaching
[1:38:10] everything.
[1:38:11] After teaching everything, I gave an
[1:38:14] offer. I said, I have I'm going to look
[1:38:16] for 1 million billion
[1:38:20] and I'll give it to anybody
[1:38:24] among you here that will show me one
[1:38:27] person
[1:38:29] that was ever baptized in any other way
[1:38:34] but in the name of the Lord.
[1:38:37] Oh, just show me one person who was
[1:38:39] baptized in father son
[1:38:42] and I'll give you the one.
[1:38:45] So that brother went and searched. He
[1:38:46] told me he was searching
[1:38:50] for for about a day or two
[1:38:52] and uh he could not find it.
[1:38:57] So he came back and he said, "I've come
[1:39:00] now so you can now teach me properly
[1:39:04] so I can understand.
[1:39:06] which is the correct water buffer.
[1:39:10] So together with pastor Ephraim
[1:39:13] we shared with him and went into the
[1:39:14] details
[1:39:16] and you know he's a minister he has a
[1:39:18] group following him he's ministering to
[1:39:22] and so he was really moved
[1:39:26] and he tried to dodge it
[1:39:30] he said maybe next time we'll talk
[1:39:33] but I say what do you say he said it is
[1:39:36] in the word but I have more
[1:39:39] I said I'm here bring the question. So
[1:39:43] we went again into the word and then
[1:39:46] finally he said now I have seen it and
[1:39:49] he said what hinders me
[1:39:53] to be baptized
[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:39:56] and I said if you believe with all your
[1:40:00] heart I'll baptize you.
[1:40:03] He say, "I believe that Jesus Christ is
[1:40:07] the son of God." Well, that sounds like
[1:40:09] something in the Bible.
[1:40:12] And and we quickly, you know, you know,
[1:40:14] we I I even had to, you know, we had to
[1:40:18] arrange some clothes
[1:40:20] and give me the next slide. And right
[1:40:23] there it was night time
[1:40:27] around 7:30
[1:40:30] and we baptized him
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:40:35] Amen. Isn't that wonderful?
[1:40:38] Amen. You give me the next slide. So
[1:40:41] this is the minister's meeting
[1:40:44] that we had in Pastor Ephra's church.
[1:40:49] Um,
[1:40:51] give me the next slide.
[1:40:54] I don't know how that came through.
[1:40:55] There were several other pictures.
[1:40:58] Uh, okay. Give me the next slide. There
[1:41:00] is the church there.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Okay. Give me the next slide.
[1:41:08] Uh, no. No. Go back.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is the Sunday meetings.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Sunday service.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; We had to have two services. But you
[1:41:17] know we we we we we only had one because
[1:41:20] of of the other meetings we were
[1:41:21] supposed to have
[1:41:25] and my limited time. So the the
[1:41:28] ministers who had traveled they came to
[1:41:30] me.
[1:41:31] How can you leave us like that?
[1:41:34] Let us at least have another service. It
[1:41:36] really broke my heart. I felt like we
[1:41:39] wish we had more time
[1:41:42] and so but we had a wonderful service.
[1:41:46] Pastor Ephraim has really done a good
[1:41:48] work there.
[1:41:50] Let's go to the next slide
[1:41:52] and that is um fellowship with the some
[1:41:55] of the ministers there.
[1:41:59] This is pastor Tesa
[1:42:02] the one who is now pastor in the first
[1:42:04] church in
[1:42:07] this brother
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; who also started another new work in
[1:42:12] Adis Ababa.
[1:42:14] He came to Aasa for fellowship
[1:42:19] and that's pastor
[1:42:22] and so after that the following day.
[1:42:25] [Music]
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Can I have the next slide brother? There
[1:42:29] is a fellowship with other ministers. So
[1:42:31] these other ministers they came they
[1:42:32] said no we want to have more
[1:42:38] and those are all Pentecostal
[1:42:42] ministers there.
[1:42:44] And then the others are ministers with
[1:42:46] pastor Ephra.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; And we really pounded on the word.
[1:42:53] But we will just wait to see the future
[1:42:55] that will come which will come.
[1:42:58] Amen. Give me the next. So then after
[1:43:01] this we had to fly back to Adis Ababa.
[1:43:05] And before I I I go to Adis,
[1:43:08] I should say we we really had a
[1:43:10] wonderful time in our
[1:43:13] and with the saints there. Pastor Ephra
[1:43:17] and his family, his wife cooked us a
[1:43:20] very good meal.
[1:43:22] His wife is a Ugandan.
[1:43:25] So I had um a chance to eat some port.
[1:43:30] She she really took good care of us.
[1:43:34] Amen. And and uh pastor Ephraim
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; sent his greetings
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; to the church.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Um so this is now Adisaba.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Um uh you already know the one in the
[1:43:49] middle but the other brother
[1:43:54] his name is brother Habtom.
[1:43:57] when I was still a pastor in Addis,
[1:44:00] he was introduced to me by brother Giri
[1:44:05] and brother Habtom, you know, also comes
[1:44:08] from Tigra
[1:44:10] but you know living in Addis at a time
[1:44:14] at that time
[1:44:16] and this brother currently moved to
[1:44:20] Canada
[1:44:23] in in the Ontario area
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; and has Actually, I want I want you to
[1:44:28] pray because he has asked me to come.
[1:44:30] He's um he's um he he's um you know
[1:44:34] ministering among the Pentecostals.
[1:44:36] [Music]
[1:44:39] He's ministering to them. is introducing
[1:44:41] the message to him
[1:44:44] and he has asked me to if it is possible
[1:44:46] to go and help him
[1:44:49] you know talk to some of his friends
[1:44:52] and the minister Pentecostal ministers
[1:44:54] there
[1:44:56] and uh you you pray about it because the
[1:44:59] Lord willing next month I'm planning on
[1:45:01] doing that
[1:45:04] and he was the very first one that we
[1:45:06] wed in the country
[1:45:11] He and his wife, Sister Yis, right?
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Of course, you did not hear her
[1:45:17] Ethiopian name.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you you pray over that.
[1:45:23] You see that flower behind there
[1:45:26] that was it was a new year in Ethiopia.
[1:45:33] You know, there are seven years behind
[1:45:34] our calendar.
[1:45:38] So they use their Ethiopian color.
[1:45:42] Ethiopia.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Can I have the next uh slide? So then
[1:45:46] this is the Adisaba fellowship of
[1:45:48] brother.
[1:45:53] We also had some good time
[1:45:56] with the believers there
[1:45:59] and uh as we spoke to them.
[1:46:02] Um give me the next slide.
[1:46:06] And then that is brother Giri
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; and his wife Sister Yodit.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; They just had a new baby.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; So I I said I have to visit them
[1:46:18] and you know this sister.
[1:46:22] She was very instrumental
[1:46:27] [Music]
[1:46:28] in all the testimonies you are seeing.
[1:46:32] She was the first to believe
[1:46:34] actually the second after the one
[1:46:36] brother
[1:46:38] and she turned out to be very
[1:46:39] instrumental. which was my first
[1:46:40] interpreter in Ethiopia
[1:46:43] and he and her husband are now working
[1:46:45] with VGR
[1:46:48] but they they are really they were very
[1:46:52] they're like pillars in Ethiopia
[1:46:55] and can I have the last
[1:46:58] that is me and sister
[1:47:01] sister Y's baby
[1:47:04] [Music]
[1:47:06] at at their home and I felt like a
[1:47:10] grandfather.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Well, I thought that is good for you to
[1:47:16] see.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:21] But maybe you want to put back.
[1:47:26] Amen.
[1:47:28] The Lord is really doing good things
[1:47:32] and we should keep those believers in
[1:47:34] prayers.
[1:47:36] There's a lot of work to do in Ethiopia.
[1:47:39] And um we are trying to uh do a lot and
[1:47:44] help in a lot
[1:47:48] especially in the southern area and the
[1:47:50] northern area.
[1:47:53] So would you remember to pray?
[1:47:57] Amen.
[1:47:58] Praise God.
[1:48:01] How many are ready for the word?
[1:48:05] Amen. Yeah.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; So, uh if you're ready for the word,
[1:48:10] stand with me and uh we are going to
[1:48:13] read from
[1:48:16] um and I hope today I get done with this
[1:48:18] subject
[1:48:21] of the narrow way.
[1:48:24] But let us read again Matthew
[1:48:29] for just our reading
[1:48:32] chapter 7
[1:48:40] vers 13
[1:48:44] and 14.
[1:48:56] Enter ye in at the straight gate, for
[1:48:59] wide is the gate, and broad is the way
[1:49:02] that leadth to destruction, and many
[1:49:05] there be which go in there. Because
[1:49:08] straight is the gate, and narrow is the
[1:49:11] way, which leadth unto life, and few
[1:49:14] there be that find it.
[1:49:38] Shall we pray? Lord Jesus, may you
[1:49:42] please help me that Lord, the things
[1:49:45] you've laid on my heart,
[1:49:48] I'll be able to not stand in the way of
[1:49:51] your spirit speaking to your people.
[1:49:55] Let me lose myself,
[1:49:58] lose my mind
[1:50:01] that Lord, you will just come and take
[1:50:04] over,
[1:50:06] take me aside.
[1:50:08] even my brother who is interpreting.
[1:50:11] May we all get into the realm of
[1:50:13] revelation.
[1:50:16] Also help the people that are have come
[1:50:20] and others streaming this service and
[1:50:23] their desire is to hear from you.
[1:50:26] Lord, may you take us all aside.
[1:50:30] May they also enter into the realm of
[1:50:32] revelation
[1:50:34] and may we hear from you. Help us to
[1:50:37] concentrate.
[1:50:39] Help us to uh Lord not be distracted by
[1:50:41] anything.
[1:50:44] May your holy spirit accomplish
[1:50:46] the purpose for which you have desired
[1:50:48] today.
[1:50:50] Lord I commit this service into
[1:50:54] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may be
[1:50:57] seated church.
[1:51:02] Um also before we get into the word this
[1:51:05] morning
[1:51:07] Please receive greetings from brother
[1:51:08] Polyup.
[1:51:11] He mentioned to me that he's going to be
[1:51:13] preaching in somewhere close to
[1:51:16] Islamabad this morning.
[1:51:21] He went to have fellowship with the with
[1:51:22] the brethren
[1:51:25] and he was quickly asked to preach.
[1:51:28] So uh it looks like God is trying to do
[1:51:30] something.
[1:51:32] So I told him, well, you're going there
[1:51:34] not only for school but for a purpose.
[1:51:38] So do you remember to pray for him?
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; So now I'm speaking on a narrow way this
[1:51:44] morning
[1:51:46] and I have uh I realize on Wednesday
[1:51:52] I realized
[1:51:54] that always on Wednesdays
[1:51:56] I have more liberty to preach.
[1:52:00] I don't know whether that is the right
[1:52:02] interpretation.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? So you interpret
[1:52:08] it.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; I usually have more liberty than on
[1:52:14] Sunday.
[1:52:22] [Music]
[1:52:25] All right. Amen. So, so you always have
[1:52:28] more liberty on on Wednesday
[1:52:31] than on Sunday
[1:52:33] because um I don't know the reason but I
[1:52:36] think I I could guess
[1:52:40] because on Wednesday
[1:52:42] people who come they have really
[1:52:44] sacrificed
[1:52:46] [Music]
[1:52:47] and they really are hungry for the Lord.
[1:52:50] So I've noticed even with food
[1:52:54] uh when you have a lot of appetite
[1:52:58] you enjoy the food more
[1:53:02] is that not so
[1:53:04] but if your appetite is low
[1:53:09] you don't enjoy the food that
[1:53:12] so we have a lot of people who are
[1:53:14] Sunday male
[1:53:18] they only read on Sunday.
[1:53:22] The Bible says you are written epistles
[1:53:26] read of all men.
[1:53:28] Don't appear to church only on Sunday.
[1:53:33] Is that an amen?
[1:53:37] Is this what I'm talking about? On on
[1:53:40] Wednesday, I don't struggle with people
[1:53:41] say say amen.
[1:53:44] before I even say something. They want
[1:53:47] to say amen because they already hungry.
[1:53:51] So don't only come to church on Sunday
[1:53:55] as a ritual.
[1:53:58] Try your best. Sacrifice your time.
[1:54:02] Sacrifice uh uh you know it's not easy.
[1:54:07] You have to make time.
[1:54:09] And anything you do out of sacrifice,
[1:54:12] you always get a blessing out of it. So
[1:54:15] now this morning, being that you are
[1:54:17] already here, please be here.
[1:54:21] Don't think about what you're going to
[1:54:22] do after here.
[1:54:25] You'll think about it later.
[1:54:28] I'm just a man, but I am a servant of
[1:54:31] God.
[1:54:33] If you are hungry and you're pulling
[1:54:36] from the Holy Spirit,
[1:54:38] he will use me to bless you this
[1:54:39] morning.
[1:54:41] And so I wanted to, you know, just stay
[1:54:44] with one mind in one accord.
[1:54:47] And I'm happy to see sister.
[1:54:50] She's not been here for a very long
[1:54:52] time.
[1:54:54] Sister, God bless you.
[1:54:57] Amen. The narrow way.
[1:55:00] Everybody tell your neighbor the narrow
[1:55:02] way.
[1:55:04] the narrow way,
[1:55:07] not the wide,
[1:55:09] the narrow way,
[1:55:11] the narrow way
[1:55:14] is what we're talking about. And this is
[1:55:15] the third service.
[1:55:18] And I'm hoping that today we will get
[1:55:19] done with it
[1:55:22] because I have more other inspirations
[1:55:23] to share with you.
[1:55:26] And so Jesus said that straight is the
[1:55:29] gate
[1:55:31] and wide is the gate. That um straight
[1:55:34] at okay he says that wide is the gate
[1:55:36] and broad is the way that leadth to
[1:55:38] destruction.
[1:55:42] And then he said you enter at the
[1:55:44] straight gate
[1:55:47] because straight is the gate and narrow
[1:55:50] is the way which leadth unto life.
[1:55:56] But few find it.
[1:55:58] Many times we want to take the way of
[1:56:00] the majority.
[1:56:03] But I I told you last time, God always
[1:56:06] works with and in the minority.
[1:56:13] God has never been in the majority.
[1:56:16] Never in history.
[1:56:18] Never in scripture, never any any time
[1:56:22] has God ever worked with the majority.
[1:56:26] By the way, that is the truth.
[1:56:29] God has always worked with the minority
[1:56:33] because, straight is the gate, and
[1:56:37] narrow is the way
[1:56:39] which leadth unto life.
[1:56:42] Can you go? One time we were in Nairobi
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; and I was um going by the going at the
[1:56:49] to the um I think we're coming from the
[1:56:51] airport.
[1:56:53] Someone had picked me up a brother and
[1:56:56] we were driving to the city and um you
[1:56:59] know I I've given you the story before
[1:57:02] and as we were driving you know we
[1:57:04] reached somewhere
[1:57:06] close to the gate
[1:57:09] there were there different there are
[1:57:10] different ways
[1:57:13] different gates
[1:57:15] which would be clear to go through
[1:57:18] maybe about four lane.
[1:57:22] So, but everybody was going on the first
[1:57:24] one.
[1:57:26] So, we found a very long queue on the
[1:57:28] first one
[1:57:31] and all the other three were empty.
[1:57:35] So, the brother when he was arriving
[1:57:37] here,
[1:57:39] he looked around.
[1:57:41] He joined the long queue.
[1:57:44] I told him, "Why didn't you go where it
[1:57:47] is empty
[1:57:49] so we can go fast?" He said, "Well,
[1:57:52] everybody's coming here.
[1:57:55] There should be something in front."
[1:58:00] And that's how many people make
[1:58:01] decisions.
[1:58:04] You mean all these people are fools
[1:58:09] with God
[1:58:11] with and you know when we arrived in
[1:58:13] front there was no problem with the
[1:58:15] other gates
[1:58:20] but it's just how their brain how the
[1:58:21] brains of people function.
[1:58:25] They think if the majority are going
[1:58:26] somewhere
[1:58:28] it must be good.
[1:58:31] But now with spiritual things
[1:58:34] and please open your spiritual eyes as I
[1:58:36] speak
[1:58:38] with the spiritual things
[1:58:40] where wherever the majority go
[1:58:44] there must be a problem
[1:58:47] because God always works with the
[1:58:49] minority.
[1:58:52] I dare you to show me any scripture
[1:58:56] or any time in history
[1:58:58] where God dealt with the majority.
[1:59:01] God always deals with the minority
[1:59:04] because straight is the gap and narrow
[1:59:07] is the way which leadth unto life and
[1:59:11] few find it.
[1:59:14] I want to be among the few.
[1:59:17] The majority will always go through the
[1:59:19] wide gate.
[1:59:21] They will always go where everybody is
[1:59:23] saying. They will always believe what
[1:59:26] everybody's believing. I don't want to
[1:59:28] be in the majority. I don't want to
[1:59:31] believe something because everybody's
[1:59:32] believing it.
[1:59:34] I want to search the scriptures
[1:59:38] and I want to know and I want to be
[1:59:40] sure.
[1:59:42] The Bible says make your calling and
[1:59:44] election sure.
[1:59:49] Be sure what you're believing.
[1:59:52] Praise God.
[1:59:54] and and um you know our subject
[1:59:57] has been mainly you know taken out of
[1:59:59] Jude.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; You know Jude is was a brother of Jesus
[2:00:07] and um you know brother of James
[2:00:11] and he he gave he was warning us he
[2:00:15] warned the church of the false teachers.
[2:00:20] Of course, even after here, after this
[2:00:22] scripture in Matthew, when you go down,
[2:00:24] then it begins warning us of false
[2:00:26] prophet.
[2:00:31] You know, God never warned us of one
[2:00:33] true prophet.
[2:00:36] He warned us of the many false prophets.
[2:00:42] So, we are not worried about the one
[2:00:44] true prophet.
[2:00:47] We are worried about the many name.
[2:00:50] The many who are saying the same thing
[2:00:54] are the false ones
[2:00:57] and the one saying that a different
[2:00:59] thing from all of them
[2:01:02] is the right one. Hallelujah. I am not
[2:01:06] ashamed to say I believe the message of
[2:01:09] William Brham.
[2:01:14] Why? Because William Brham's message
[2:01:19] did not point me to William Brham
[2:01:23] pointed me to Christ the word.
[2:01:29] All the major preachers in our
[2:01:30] generation
[2:01:33] talk about William Brham
[2:01:36] and when they talk about him they say he
[2:01:39] was a mighty man of God.
[2:01:42] He was a mighty prophet. They agree that
[2:01:45] he was a prophet when he raised the
[2:01:47] dead. They agree he was a prophet when
[2:01:51] he healed the sick, when the lamb
[2:01:53] walked, when the blind saw. They agree
[2:01:56] was a prophet
[2:01:58] when the supernatural happened.
[2:02:01] But when it comes to the third phase of
[2:02:05] his ministry,
[2:02:08] all of them who agree he was a prophet
[2:02:13] now say he is a prophet.
[2:02:17] They say William Brham was a a true
[2:02:18] prophet
[2:02:20] and then he went astray at the end of
[2:02:23] his ministry.
[2:02:25] And then you ask them where did he go
[2:02:27] astray
[2:02:29] and they would say he told wrong things.
[2:02:33] One one of them said no because he he
[2:02:35] was a prophet not a teacher but he made
[2:02:37] himself a teacher.
[2:02:42] And then you know if you read if you're
[2:02:44] a good Bible reader
[2:02:47] to who does the word of God come to
[2:02:50] the word of God does not come to a
[2:02:52] teacher.
[2:02:54] It does not come to a a you know a
[2:02:57] pastor. It doesn't come to an
[2:02:59] evangelist.
[2:03:00] The word of God in a generation
[2:03:04] comes to a prophet.
[2:03:07] It is a prophet that receives the word
[2:03:11] and then gives it to the people in the
[2:03:12] generation.
[2:03:14] You read Amos 3:7,
[2:03:16] you will see it is the truth. God does
[2:03:19] nothing except he has sent a prophet in
[2:03:22] a generation.
[2:03:24] And then they say he went astray.
[2:03:26] And then you ask them where did he go
[2:03:29] astray? Oh, because he told that God is
[2:03:32] one. So how many gods do you believe?
[2:03:37] Oh, of course. Ah, we forgot they
[2:03:38] believe in three gods.
[2:03:41] So when William Bham preached one god,
[2:03:44] they were offended. He told that there
[2:03:48] is one god and is a spirit.
[2:03:53] And he was the Jehovah of the Old
[2:03:55] Testament.
[2:03:56] And the Jehovah of the Old Testament
[2:03:59] is the Jesus of the new.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; And they could not stomach about.
[2:04:06] But the few in this last day can receive
[2:04:10] them.
[2:04:12] Amen. Amen. They believe Jesus is the
[2:04:16] resurrection and the life. They believe
[2:04:19] he's the greater I am. Amen. They
[2:04:22] believe that Jesus, Amen, the Jehovah of
[2:04:25] the Old Testament is the Jesus of the
[2:04:27] new.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe John 1,
[2:04:32] which says, "In the beginning was the
[2:04:33] word. The word was with God, and the
[2:04:37] word was God." Vers 14 says, "And the
[2:04:41] word was made manifest."
[2:04:44] Amen. God was made manifest.
[2:04:48] He put on flesh and was made manifest
[2:04:51] among us.
[2:04:53] So we believe one God
[2:04:56] and anybody who believes in one God
[2:05:00] is the true believer.
[2:05:04] And the ones who don't believe in one
[2:05:05] God,
[2:05:07] they they have gone so much astray
[2:05:11] that even the devil is shocked.
[2:05:17] Because the Bible says you believe in
[2:05:20] one God,
[2:05:21] thou doest well. Even the devils believe
[2:05:26] and they tremble.
[2:05:28] That's the Bible.
[2:05:30] Even the devils believe.
[2:05:32] people who don't believe in one god
[2:05:35] they even shock satan himself
[2:05:41] because Satan was there
[2:05:44] he didn't see three god
[2:05:46] he saw one god father son holy spirit
[2:05:51] and not three separate person
[2:05:54] it is the same god in three offices
[2:05:59] in three manifestation
[2:06:01] god above
[2:06:03] God with us, God in us, the same God.
[2:06:09] Jesus said, I go, "I will come back to
[2:06:12] you." Amen. I will be in you and with
[2:06:16] you. And then he said, I the father will
[2:06:18] will will send the comforter
[2:06:22] and the father will come. So who will
[2:06:24] come? Is it the spirit? Is it the
[2:06:26] father? Is it the son?
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. is the same thing
[2:06:34] [Music]
[2:06:36] and people are confused.
[2:06:39] So we preach one god here.
[2:06:41] What a baptism in the name of our lord
[2:06:43] Jesus Christ. They don't believe it.
[2:06:46] They believe in all list of things
[2:06:49] that cannot be founded by the bible
[2:06:53] and they are the many
[2:06:57] and they are the majority.
[2:07:00] They have mega churches
[2:07:02] and you people think they are the right
[2:07:05] one.
[2:07:07] No, the right one has always been one
[2:07:12] and the first one have always been the
[2:07:14] many, the majority,
[2:07:17] one Elijah,
[2:07:19] 400 prophets of B.
[2:07:23] That's the God I believe.
[2:07:26] Amen. But you see we we don't believe
[2:07:29] blindly.
[2:07:32] Whatever we believe must be identified
[2:07:36] in the word.
[2:07:39] And the reason why I believed in the
[2:07:41] message of William Brham to be the truth
[2:07:45] because his message leads us to Christ.
[2:07:50] Not to an organization,
[2:07:52] not to an individual, not to himself.
[2:07:56] But he leads us to Christ.
[2:07:59] So we are the true Jesus people.
[2:08:05] Praise God.
[2:08:08] Now Jude goes ahead to explain
[2:08:12] that there are those who shall come
[2:08:15] teaching false things.
[2:08:18] He said they're filthy dreamers.
[2:08:22] They defile the flesh.
[2:08:25] They despise dominion
[2:08:27] and speak evil of Gintes.
[2:08:31] And on verses 11, he speaks of them this
[2:08:34] way. Why unto them? For they have gone
[2:08:38] in the way of Cain
[2:08:40] and read greatly after the era of Bam
[2:08:42] for reward
[2:08:45] and perished in the gain sayings of
[2:08:46] Kora.
[2:08:49] Praise God.
[2:08:51] And and you know the whole book I told
[2:08:54] you last Sunday that the whole book of
[2:08:55] Jude warns us about false teachers
[2:09:01] and ungodly men
[2:09:04] who creep into the church.
[2:09:07] Turning the grace of God into sin,
[2:09:11] denying the word, denying the Lord.
[2:09:15] you know, when you talk about and I was
[2:09:18] I had just talked about, you know, the
[2:09:20] you know what a cult is
[2:09:24] and I'm sure you now know what a cult
[2:09:25] is.
[2:09:27] A cult is anything that leads you to
[2:09:31] something else
[2:09:33] give that makes you to have devotion
[2:09:37] to something
[2:09:39] rather than Christ.
[2:09:42] That something can be a religion.
[2:09:45] You talk about my religion,
[2:09:48] we we separate.
[2:09:51] You talk about my political,
[2:09:54] we separate. You talk about my football
[2:09:57] club, we separate. You see, you talk
[2:10:01] about my man,
[2:10:03] my pastor, my prophet, my so and so, we
[2:10:07] separate. So their allegiance
[2:10:11] is with the thing
[2:10:15] more than Christ.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; That's why brother you must never let
[2:10:19] anything be beyond Christ in your heart.
[2:10:25] Christ and then anything else.
[2:10:28] Amen. Is is our absolute.
[2:10:33] Amen. And Christ is not something. He is
[2:10:37] the word. He's a person. Amen. And when
[2:10:42] you receive him, you will believe every
[2:10:45] word.
[2:10:48] And now Jude warns the believers
[2:10:53] of going against the word,
[2:10:58] false teachers.
[2:11:00] And then he gives us three examples
[2:11:04] which he has taken from the Old
[2:11:05] Testament.
[2:11:07] And one of them he says um that they
[2:11:09] went in in the way of Cain
[2:11:12] on Sunday last Sunday I spoke about the
[2:11:14] way of Kane.
[2:11:16] Uh you know the way of Cain represents
[2:11:18] false worship.
[2:11:22] What is false worship? It is religion
[2:11:26] instead of revelation.
[2:11:28] God is not looking for religion.
[2:11:30] God is looking for revelation.
[2:11:32] Cain had religion but Cain had no
[2:11:35] revelation.
[2:11:37] God is not looking for you giving
[2:11:39] something.
[2:11:41] God is not looking for you to join a
[2:11:43] church. God is not looking for you even
[2:11:45] to do anything.
[2:11:48] It is not about your works.
[2:11:51] None of our works
[2:11:53] can buy us salvation.
[2:11:55] Our works is just religion.
[2:12:00] We need to go beyond our work.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; And we go into the realm of revelation.
[2:12:10] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God. God help me to show you
[2:12:15] this. You know when I say that it does
[2:12:19] not mean we will not do the good works.
[2:12:24] You know Jesus spoke to the people and
[2:12:27] he told them if your faith
[2:12:31] does not go beyond that of the Pharisees
[2:12:39] you see
[2:12:41] if you're following me say amen.
[2:12:44] What was the faith of the citizens?
[2:12:48] It was only embedded in the works they
[2:12:51] were doing.
[2:12:56] Are you following me? The works they
[2:12:59] were doing,
[2:13:02] washing hands,
[2:13:04] keeping Sabbath, not committing
[2:13:06] adultery, not not doing this, not lying.
[2:13:10] So those are the works. If you do those
[2:13:13] works very well,
[2:13:17] you are a good religious.
[2:13:21] [Music]
[2:13:24] And according to them, you will go to
[2:13:27] heaven as long as you keep all the rules
[2:13:31] of the religion.
[2:13:34] Now, here came a boy
[2:13:38] who had kept these rules from when he
[2:13:40] was a child
[2:13:44] and he asked Jesus. He said, "What must
[2:13:49] I do?
[2:13:50] to be saved.
[2:13:52] But what did Jesus tell him?
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus told him, "Go and do
[2:13:59] the laws.
[2:14:03] You know them.
[2:14:05] Don't do not commit adultery. Not do not
[2:14:08] don't not you know, not all those ones."
[2:14:12] I'm sure the younger man was happy. He
[2:14:15] said, "Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I have
[2:14:17] done all of them.
[2:14:20] since I was a child.
[2:14:23] Did Jesus say, "Amen. Now you can go."
[2:14:28] No.
[2:14:30] He told him, "Yes, you have done all of
[2:14:33] them. But there is one more
[2:14:37] thing that you must do." So what is it?
[2:14:42] Go. Sell everything you have.
[2:14:47] Give to the poor.
[2:14:49] Come follow me.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; The man who was disappointed.
[2:14:57] Why? He never had revelation.
[2:15:01] He never understood
[2:15:03] what Jesus was saying. He wanted rules
[2:15:07] to do.
[2:15:10] But he didn't want to lose himself.
[2:15:13] Jesus was saying, "You have to receive
[2:15:16] me. You have to lose everything.
[2:15:20] You can't get me if you still have
[2:15:23] yourself. You have to die to yourself.
[2:15:27] Your desire, die to the world, your
[2:15:30] religion, to everything.
[2:15:33] Then and only then can you come and
[2:15:36] follow me.
[2:15:38] But the younger man did not have
[2:15:41] revelation
[2:15:42] to understand what Jesus meant.
[2:15:45] So he went away sad.
[2:15:49] No revelation but only a religion.
[2:15:52] Brethren, we must do things by
[2:15:54] revelation.
[2:16:00] You know in the Old Testament
[2:16:02] the Bible required
[2:16:08] this one may bite. So follow me closely.
[2:16:12] May God help me.
[2:16:14] The Bible required
[2:16:16] every believer
[2:16:20] to pay
[2:16:21] 10%
[2:16:24] out of his income
[2:16:28] to the Lord.
[2:16:31] Right?
[2:16:33] We call it tithe.
[2:16:37] It is a requirement of the law.
[2:16:40] Actually,
[2:16:42] even before the law, you remember Mo
[2:16:45] Abraham paid tithe,
[2:16:48] before the law of Moses,
[2:16:50] but even the requirement of the law was
[2:16:53] you must pay tithe
[2:16:56] and then you give offering.
[2:16:58] But you see in the New Testament,
[2:17:01] oh my, oh my, just just open your heart
[2:17:03] now. open your heart
[2:17:05] to especially to to those of you who
[2:17:07] don't pay tithe.
[2:17:10] You have not even become a Pharisee yet.
[2:17:16] Aar a good
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; must be a serious sincere tithe payer
[2:17:25] and that's how they were in the Old
[2:17:27] Testament.
[2:17:29] That's to be a serious Pharisee
[2:17:33] meaning to be a good religious person.
[2:17:37] What God requires
[2:17:39] is not religion.
[2:17:42] He requires something higher than
[2:17:44] religion.
[2:17:47] [Music]
[2:17:49] Revelation.
[2:17:53] Amen. And so we notice that in the New
[2:17:58] Testament under the dispensation of the
[2:18:00] Holy Ghost,
[2:18:03] the believers in the book of Acts
[2:18:07] They would look at each other.
[2:18:10] This is brother Calb. This is brother.
[2:18:13] Bring all of you together.
[2:18:16] Brother, you have how many cows?
[2:18:19] 10. Okay. You You have how many lands?
[2:18:23] 10 acres.
[2:18:26] You have what? A house.
[2:18:28] Okay. Now, brethren, let us agree by
[2:18:32] revelation
[2:18:33] we sell everything we have.
[2:18:37] Let us bring all the money together
[2:18:41] and we divide it
[2:18:43] equally
[2:18:46] among ourselves.
[2:18:49] Now the brothers who did not have
[2:18:50] revelation
[2:18:53] they like after all even the word does
[2:18:54] not say that
[2:18:56] the word says only 10%.
[2:19:00] This is our labor.
[2:19:03] The other sister is lazy. She doesn't
[2:19:05] even even the other brother they want to
[2:19:08] earn on our swear.
[2:19:10] So they went outside
[2:19:12] and they sold their land and they
[2:19:15] connived among themselves. Let us go and
[2:19:18] take tell them that this is what we saw.
[2:19:21] They sold 50 million. They brought only
[2:19:23] 10.
[2:19:25] After all in the Old Testament it was
[2:19:27] only 10%.
[2:19:29] And so they brought what they had sold
[2:19:32] according to what they had agreed the
[2:19:34] rest they kept.
[2:19:39] So they came in the church. It was the
[2:19:41] brother who came in first.
[2:19:44] You know he was one of the rich brothers
[2:19:45] in the church
[2:19:47] but he came late. Pastor Pastor Peter
[2:19:50] was already on the boat
[2:19:53] and he came late. He sat down.
[2:19:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:19:58] Wait, brother.
[2:20:01] Is this what you have sold?
[2:20:04] Yes, pastor. Of course,
[2:20:08] that's what we sold.
[2:20:10] Praise God.
[2:20:12] He said, "You have not deceived me. You
[2:20:15] have deceived the Holy Spirit."
[2:20:19] Before he even finished speaking,
[2:20:21] the man died physically.
[2:20:25] They carried him. I am talking about New
[2:20:28] Testament church.
[2:20:32] It must be beyond the law.
[2:20:36] Who killed this man? Under the law, they
[2:20:39] would stone you. But under the holy
[2:20:41] ghost, it is God to work on you.
[2:20:46] And and here the man he was buried.
[2:20:51] I don't know where the what the
[2:20:52] government did at that time.
[2:20:56] They buried him. Imagine a church
[2:20:58] killing someone and buried him.
[2:21:02] And sister came also
[2:21:06] with her high heels.
[2:21:12] Sister Safira.
[2:21:15] Yeah. God bless you, sir.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; She sat down. Sister Safira,
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; is this what your husband brought? Is it
[2:21:22] all that you sold?
[2:21:26] Yes. Pastor
[2:21:28] said, "All right. The feet which carried
[2:21:30] your husband
[2:21:32] will carry you."
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; Who was talking? A pastor, a man led by
[2:21:39] the Holy Ghost.
[2:21:42] My friends, don't play with the Holy
[2:21:44] Ghost.
[2:21:46] The law you can pray, but the Holy
[2:21:47] Ghost, don't play with it.
[2:21:51] That's why he said, "Touch not my
[2:21:52] anointing.
[2:21:55] Do my prophets know how?
[2:21:59] Because God fights for his own and you
[2:22:03] are his own.
[2:22:05] He will always fight for you.
[2:22:08] Whatever you speak, it's not you
[2:22:10] speaking. It's God speaking through you.
[2:22:15] That's the power of the Holy Ghost.
[2:22:21] And now today we are under the same
[2:22:24] grace.
[2:22:26] You are saying 10%. But even 10% you
[2:22:29] cannot pay.
[2:22:31] You are even worse than a far
[2:22:35] because a will be religious will fulfill
[2:22:39] that one. You will say how much? 10%
[2:22:43] only.
[2:22:45] If if my tithe is 5,000
[2:22:48] 100 he will make a sure he even gets a
[2:22:52] change of 100 ch
[2:22:57] so that it can be exactly 100
[2:23:00] I have 500 I'm looking for change
[2:23:03] because I want to pay tithe
[2:23:08] so that he pays 5,100
[2:23:12] that's a good religious
[2:23:15] If you are under the grace, you are not
[2:23:18] going to follow only the requirement of
[2:23:20] the law.
[2:23:23] You are going to give
[2:23:26] by what I'm teaching is a big principle.
[2:23:31] You are going to give
[2:23:33] not by religion
[2:23:36] not by the requirement of the law but
[2:23:38] you are going to give by revelation.
[2:23:44] Revelation
[2:23:46] sometimes you know revelation if it is
[2:23:49] something which has been revealed to you
[2:23:52] usually it is more than what you can do.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:23:58] I just told you a testimony of a brother
[2:24:00] in Ethiopia.
[2:24:02] They not doing well. But it was just a
[2:24:05] revelation.
[2:24:07] I have to do this and I let him do it
[2:24:10] because it was a revelation.
[2:24:12] You know, you hear needs in the church.
[2:24:14] I'm so going through this going through
[2:24:16] this.
[2:24:18] But he said me I've paid my tithe.
[2:24:22] That's enough. No revelation. But if you
[2:24:25] have revelation, you have something on
[2:24:27] the account,
[2:24:29] you will say, "Why can I keep this?"
[2:24:31] When my brother in the church is going
[2:24:33] through something,
[2:24:35] when my sister's going through
[2:24:36] something,
[2:24:38] let me do this for the sake of the
[2:24:40] kingdom of God. That's a man with
[2:24:42] revelation.
[2:24:44] Now in the New Testament, it says, "Give
[2:24:47] and it shall be given
[2:24:50] press down, shaken up." You know pastor
[2:24:53] you praying teach preaching about money.
[2:24:55] No I am getting revelation.
[2:25:00] Cain brought an offering. It was a good
[2:25:03] offering
[2:25:05] but Cain
[2:25:19] was done.
[2:25:21] Why they giving a sacrifice?
[2:25:24] This sacrifice was by revelation.
[2:25:28] You know you cannot give a sacrifice
[2:25:31] unless you have a revelation
[2:25:34] why you are giving
[2:25:37] that's the revelation
[2:25:39] why you are giving and received a
[2:25:42] revelation that I am giving
[2:25:46] blood
[2:25:48] because blood was mixed up somewhere.
[2:25:55] There is a blood that was mixed up
[2:25:58] somewhere
[2:26:00] and my brother Kane I don't know why I'm
[2:26:02] feeling that way but I know my brother
[2:26:06] Kane is of another seed
[2:26:09] blood that was mixed up somewhere
[2:26:13] and had a revelation
[2:26:15] in blood which will take away the sin
[2:26:20] may not be my blood may not be the blood
[2:26:23] of the animal but this blood of the
[2:26:26] animal
[2:26:27] will stand in for me
[2:26:30] who told that to Abel
[2:26:34] by revelation
[2:26:37] andel brought blood and when blood went
[2:26:40] before the throne of God
[2:26:45] [Music]
[2:26:48] said it smells
[2:26:51] The offering smells good
[2:26:55] because it was an offering out of
[2:26:58] revelation.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; Brethren, amen.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; If we as a church of Christ
[2:27:03] can do things by revelation,
[2:27:06] not by bandwagon,
[2:27:09] not by coping so and so coping the other
[2:27:11] way. But I am doing this because God has
[2:27:14] revealed it to me.
[2:27:17] I am sweeping the church because God has
[2:27:18] given me.
[2:27:21] I am playing instrument because God has
[2:27:24] I'm helping my brother because it is a
[2:27:26] revelation.
[2:27:28] I am singing and dancing
[2:27:31] to God. Everybody's doing it. It is a
[2:27:33] revelation from God.
[2:27:36] I am giving to land fund
[2:27:38] because it is a revelation.
[2:27:41] I am marrying sister
[2:27:44] Julia because it is a revelation.
[2:27:47] Are you hearing me? I am refusing so and
[2:27:50] so because it's a revelation rather let
[2:27:54] us walk by revelation
[2:27:58] taught us faith is a revelation
[2:28:02] and he said without fa without without
[2:28:04] faith that's what the Bible say without
[2:28:07] faith everybody repeat with me without
[2:28:09] faith
[2:28:11] it is
[2:28:14] to please God you can never please God
[2:28:18] without revelation. You can come to
[2:28:21] church. You can pay your tithe. You can
[2:28:23] dress well. You can sing well. You can
[2:28:26] do everything well. But if you have no
[2:28:29] spiritual revelation,
[2:28:32] God will never be pleased.
[2:28:37] And the true church of Jesus
[2:28:40] is not doing things by religion,
[2:28:44] but revelation.
[2:28:48] understood
[2:28:49] it say amen.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; Now Jude was warning the church
[2:28:56] about uh you know false prophets and he
[2:28:59] said these will go into the by the way
[2:29:02] of Cain.
[2:29:05] The way of Cain. What was the way of
[2:29:08] Cain? The way of Cain was serving God
[2:29:13] without revelation.
[2:29:16] Are you here this morning when you have
[2:29:19] been walking by the way of Cain?
[2:29:22] May God help you.
[2:29:24] May God save you. May God deliver you.
[2:29:28] Come out of the way of Cain. Walk in the
[2:29:31] way of Ab.
[2:29:33] Walk in the way of S.
[2:29:35] Walk in the way of revelation.
[2:29:38] Hallelujah. The Bible says by faith
[2:29:40] Moses
[2:29:42] by faith Sarah by faith Abra by faith by
[2:29:46] faith every man of God every woman of
[2:29:50] God walked by revelation.
[2:29:54] And the Bible say by faith Enoch he
[2:29:58] walked with God until he was no more.
[2:30:02] Where did he go? He was changed. He went
[2:30:06] into another dimension
[2:30:08] by revelation.
[2:30:10] Even as today, brethren, we are going to
[2:30:14] be changed by revelation.
[2:30:18] Hallelujah. You receive the Holy Ghost
[2:30:21] by revelation. You receive the word by
[2:30:24] revelation. You receive your theophony
[2:30:28] by revelation.
[2:30:31] You marry by revelation.
[2:30:34] Whatever you do, do by revelation.
[2:30:38] You cannot hate someone by revelation.
[2:30:43] So if you have one, if you have an enemy
[2:30:47] who is not certain, you have no
[2:30:49] revelation.
[2:30:54] It means we are very small.
[2:30:57] That means there is no revelation.
[2:31:00] Brethren, if you have an enemy who is
[2:31:03] not Satan, you need to be delivered. You
[2:31:07] need to be saved. You need to be born
[2:31:09] again.
[2:31:10] You need to receive a revelation
[2:31:13] because the Bible says, "Amen. Love one
[2:31:16] another, not as Cain,
[2:31:19] who was the son of the wicked. He did
[2:31:22] not love his brother
[2:31:25] killed him. Why? He had no revenge.
[2:31:30] But if you're a son of God, you will
[2:31:33] love everybody.
[2:31:35] I said you will love everybody.
[2:31:38] So if you have an enemy,
[2:31:40] if revelation has struck you right now
[2:31:45] become your your friends.
[2:31:49] Forgive them. I said forgive them. It's
[2:31:52] not me telling you. It's God speaking to
[2:31:54] you. Forgive your enemies.
[2:31:57] Love those who do bad to you.
[2:32:00] That's what Jesus told.
[2:32:03] And if Jesus is in your heart, you
[2:32:06] cannot have hatred.
[2:32:08] [Music]
[2:32:10] Me, that man, that woman, I will never.
[2:32:16] Oh brother, sister, may God change you.
[2:32:20] Oh, those of you who are behind, may God
[2:32:21] touch you.
[2:32:24] May you love every brother, even that
[2:32:26] one who slapped you. The Bible says,
[2:32:29] "Put another child,
[2:32:31] even the one who took your C. Give him
[2:32:34] another one." That's what Jesus taught.
[2:32:38] Am I teaching the Bible? Therefore, you
[2:32:41] must love your enemy.
[2:32:43] The way of Cain
[2:32:45] is a way of denomination
[2:32:48] whereby you don't love somebody
[2:32:50] because they are not doing what you're
[2:32:52] doing.
[2:32:53] But the way of Abel loves all brothers,
[2:32:57] loves all sisters. You know what? Abel
[2:33:01] knew Kane was of another seed. But even
[2:33:05] then, when Cain went to kill him, he did
[2:33:09] not hate him. He still loved him. He
[2:33:13] died loving.
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, love your brother.
[2:33:22] Love your enemies.
[2:33:25] Don't go in the way of Cain.
[2:33:28] Pastor, that is a hard saying.
[2:33:32] That's why it is a narrow way.
[2:33:35] Have you now understood?
[2:33:38] That is why it is a narrow way.
[2:33:41] It's not easy. How can you love your
[2:33:44] enemy? It is easy to love your brother,
[2:33:48] someone you agree with. But how can you
[2:33:50] love someone you disagree with?
[2:33:54] Let me tell you if but the Bible says if
[2:33:55] you can't if you can't disagree with
[2:33:57] somebody
[2:34:01] and you love them with all your heart
[2:34:04] there is something wrong with your
[2:34:05] experience.
[2:34:09] I can disagree with brother Omar here
[2:34:14] but still when I shake his hand I mean
[2:34:18] it with all my heart.
[2:34:21] Say father I love you
[2:34:24] about our disagreements.
[2:34:27] Many times time solves it.
[2:34:31] That's right. Many times time solves it.
[2:34:36] Maturity solves it. Imagine
[2:34:42] notice a child when you slap the child
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; because they're doing something wrong
[2:34:48] and he says you are not my friend I
[2:34:50] don't like you
[2:34:55] like okay
[2:34:57] all right you know he's a younger child
[2:35:00] you're not my friend you say okay me I'm
[2:35:04] your friend you're not my friend don't
[2:35:06] like you
[2:35:08] because she's a child.
[2:35:10] It is circumstances
[2:35:12] that dictates who are friends.
[2:35:16] But a Christian, it is your nature that
[2:35:20] determines who are your friends.
[2:35:22] Hallelujah. Your nature, if it's a
[2:35:25] nature of God, you will love everybody.
[2:35:31] Jesus, he was being beaten
[2:35:36] in his heart. You were saying, "I love
[2:35:38] you.
[2:35:40] I'm dying for you.
[2:35:44] I'm your friend."
[2:35:46] And they nailed him on the cross
[2:35:49] to the time he was nailed.
[2:35:52] He loved them. And then this man was
[2:35:55] laughing at him. He's saying, "If you
[2:35:58] are who you say you are,
[2:36:00] save yourself and save us." But what did
[2:36:04] Jesus say? Amen. He said nothing.
[2:36:08] Amen. Why? Because he had already said
[2:36:12] for God so loved why that he gave his
[2:36:17] only beloved body
[2:36:20] his only beloved body.
[2:36:22] God gave his body to be persecuted to be
[2:36:27] beaten to be you know gone all through
[2:36:29] that thing
[2:36:31] because of love. If your love, Amen,
[2:36:35] doesn't make you love your enemy,
[2:36:38] you will have a problem with your
[2:36:40] Christian experience.
[2:36:43] A brother just does something or a
[2:36:46] sister does something
[2:36:49] from today. I will never talk to that
[2:36:52] person. Even let me block them
[2:36:57] from today. And you are here and you
[2:37:01] have blocked some brothers.
[2:37:04] some sisters
[2:37:08] and you are looking at me and you have
[2:37:09] done it
[2:37:12] and you are saying you a believer.
[2:37:15] Oh my God, you need an experience now.
[2:37:19] May God touch you right now. May God
[2:37:23] increase your experience.
[2:37:25] May he give you grace and experience and
[2:37:28] love in your heart.
[2:37:31] The Jesus in your heart will not make
[2:37:34] you love your enemy.
[2:37:36] My brother, my sister, you are in a wide
[2:37:38] way,
[2:37:40] not in a narrow way.
[2:37:43] May God help us. But what I just say to
[2:37:46] you right now is thus sayeth the word.
[2:37:52] Let us not go in the way of Cain.
[2:37:56] You know, I I spoke with somebody else
[2:37:59] and I told him how I disagreed with
[2:38:01] somebody else.
[2:38:04] Later on, they saw me with them.
[2:38:07] And I was hugging them, embracing them,
[2:38:10] and I
[2:38:12] thought it's your enemy. I said, "You
[2:38:14] misunderstood.
[2:38:16] I told you how I disagreed with you,
[2:38:19] but I did not tell you was my enemy.
[2:38:22] I can disagree with you
[2:38:25] but remain your brother and your friend.
[2:38:31] By the way, one time Paul was asked a
[2:38:34] question
[2:38:37] said, "What in your opinion
[2:38:42] is the greatest miracle that William
[2:38:44] Brham ever performed?"
[2:38:51] and he had done many miracles.
[2:38:53] He said the only greatest miracle that I
[2:38:55] can allude to
[2:38:58] is that you could not differentiate
[2:39:02] between his enemies and his friends.
[2:39:11] Think about it, brother Julian,
[2:39:14] that when someone looks at you, he knows
[2:39:17] you have enemies, meaning those who
[2:39:19] don't like you.
[2:39:21] Okay? Every one of us has people who
[2:39:22] don't like them.
[2:39:27] Oh, are you angels?
[2:39:31] You have people who don't like you.
[2:39:35] Those are your enemies. Supposedly
[2:39:39] had them. But if you looked at him, the
[2:39:43] way he related with people,
[2:39:46] you could not differentiate
[2:39:48] between his enemies and his friends.
[2:39:53] If you've not reached that level,
[2:39:55] you still have a long way to go.
[2:39:59] And that's why I'm preaching to you
[2:40:01] today,
[2:40:02] the narrow way.
[2:40:06] It's not easy. It's narrow.
[2:40:10] But you have to walk through it. It's
[2:40:12] the way to eternal life.
[2:40:15] And then he gave another example of
[2:40:17] Balam. I can talk about Cain. I don't
[2:40:19] know for how long.
[2:40:24] He gave another example of Balam.
[2:40:26] He said also Balam who was greatly in
[2:40:30] the area of Balam for reward.
[2:40:35] And he warned us not to go in the era of
[2:40:37] Balam
[2:40:39] for reward.
[2:40:41] You know Balam represents greed and
[2:40:43] compromise.
[2:40:45] A prophet who loved reward and tried to
[2:40:48] c Israel.
[2:40:51] Those who follow Balam are preachers who
[2:40:53] sell the word for money
[2:40:57] or for pure popularity.
[2:40:59] Now you listening to me church. Now I
[2:41:02] read for you Revelation 2:14,
[2:41:07] which say, "Because thou hast them there
[2:41:09] that hold a doctrine of Balam."
[2:41:17] Balam is interesting.
[2:41:20] Whenever you talk about Balam, he said,
[2:41:22] "Listen, this is Sunday morning.
[2:41:25] Let me finish this sermon today.
[2:41:27] So stay with me. Let's continue to learn
[2:41:30] this together.
[2:41:32] Because we want to be better Christian.
[2:41:37] I am done long time ago preaching
[2:41:39] sermons to make you happy.
[2:41:43] I want you to mature.
[2:41:45] I want us to grow in the Lord.
[2:41:48] Okay. So now, so listeners, we we
[2:41:51] learning this together now.
[2:41:53] You know the scripture says Balam, you
[2:41:55] know, he taught Balac,
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; he told him
[2:42:01] how to cast a stumbling block before the
[2:42:03] children of Israel
[2:42:08] to eat things sacrificed unto idols
[2:42:11] and to commit fornication.
[2:42:13] Now the way of balam is twofold. It is a
[2:42:18] way of idolatry
[2:42:21] and fornication.
[2:42:24] Mhm.
[2:42:25] &gt;&gt; This is another subject which can take a
[2:42:27] long time.
[2:42:30] But I have a little quote here
[2:42:33] that I'll read for you in Paman church
[2:42:35] age.
[2:42:36] After the sacrifice was made,
[2:42:40] Bam was ready to prophesy.
[2:42:42] But God tied his tongue
[2:42:46] and he could not cast them. He blessed
[2:42:49] them. God didn't have any respect for
[2:42:52] those Nicolantans.
[2:42:53] [Music]
[2:42:56] with their PhDs, PhDs, LLDS, DD, and all
[2:43:01] their fine organizations,
[2:43:04] and the best that man could bust.
[2:43:08] But he did have respect
[2:43:11] unto Israel, for they had the word
[2:43:14] vindicated among them.
[2:43:19] Suddenly, Israel didn't look too
[2:43:22] polished up.
[2:43:25] They had just come out of Egypt and the
[2:43:26] whole racket and everything.
[2:43:29] But you know she was free now.
[2:43:34] She was a blessed people through the
[2:43:35] sovereignty of God.
[2:43:39] Suddenly Moab looked down on her
[2:43:43] and all the other nations did too.
[2:43:46] You know you you are that little Israel
[2:43:48] today.
[2:43:51] The world may look down on you.
[2:43:54] The big churches may look down on you,
[2:43:57] but let me tell you, you are blessed of
[2:44:01] the Lord.
[2:44:05] When you walk in the narrow way,
[2:44:08] it doesn't matter what people's opinion
[2:44:11] is.
[2:44:12] What matters is what God thinks about
[2:44:16] you.
[2:44:19] Hallelujah.
[2:44:20] &gt;&gt; I realized
[2:44:21] many times we want we worry about what
[2:44:24] people think about us
[2:44:27] and good men will be compromised.
[2:44:31] Good women will be compromised
[2:44:34] because they are fearing to see to not
[2:44:37] what people will think of them.
[2:44:40] Let me tell you brother sister be a man
[2:44:42] a woman of integrity.
[2:44:46] Do something
[2:44:49] because of what God thinks about you,
[2:44:54] not what your friend thinks about you,
[2:44:56] not what you whoever thinks about you.
[2:44:59] That doesn't matter.
[2:45:03] And here was Israel.
[2:45:05] They're going through Moab.
[2:45:09] I I told you that Moab was um you know
[2:45:12] they came out of the union of Lot and
[2:45:16] his daughter.
[2:45:21] You remember how it happened? I
[2:45:22] explained to you already.
[2:45:24] And so you know they they they got to
[2:45:29] and so Moab they gave birth to Moab
[2:45:32] and Moab became a big nation. There were
[2:45:35] so many. And as Israel was going through
[2:45:38] Moab, the land of Moab,
[2:45:41] they sent out a letter or message
[2:45:44] to the king of Moab,
[2:45:47] King Balac.
[2:45:50] Let us go through.
[2:45:52] If any of our men will eat something,
[2:45:56] we will pay. If anything happen,
[2:46:01] we will reimburse you. Let us go through
[2:46:04] in peace.
[2:46:06] But you know the prophet says these men,
[2:46:09] the men of God, we are under a revival.
[2:46:13] They were with a pill of fire, signs and
[2:46:16] wonders. God was in their midst. God was
[2:46:19] in their camp.
[2:46:22] King feared.
[2:46:25] If these ones go through,
[2:46:28] they may just take my people.
[2:46:33] Disallow them. He now went. He was so
[2:46:36] perturbed
[2:46:38] and he wanted to go
[2:46:41] to cast them. He went to hire a prophet
[2:46:46] called Balam so he can come and help him
[2:46:50] to cast them.
[2:46:53] He told him, "Prophet Balam, I will give
[2:46:56] you clothes.
[2:46:59] I will make your name great.
[2:47:01] I will increase your rank.
[2:47:05] I will make you the overseer, the the
[2:47:07] archbishop or whatever it is.
[2:47:12] Just do me one favor.
[2:47:14] Cast these people for me."
[2:47:17] Today we have a lot of balls.
[2:47:22] They have many titles.
[2:47:25] They have the DDS
[2:47:27] what have you. And people think
[2:47:31] because these men educated
[2:47:35] and they have you know big
[2:47:37] establishments.
[2:47:40] God must be with them.
[2:47:42] Remember my brother God is in the narrow
[2:47:44] way.
[2:47:48] Balam was so excited. He said, "All
[2:47:52] right, if there is some money, count me
[2:47:56] in. If you are here, brother, sister,
[2:48:00] and you will be quick
[2:48:02] to serve God for money,
[2:48:06] then you have a spirit of balam."
[2:48:13] &gt;&gt; That's the generation we are living in.
[2:48:15] We even have younger people who are
[2:48:18] supposed to be musicians.
[2:48:21] What do they do? They always go and um
[2:48:25] you know try and go somewhere where they
[2:48:26] will get some good money
[2:48:30] in the big churches.
[2:48:34] And these younger people will never sit
[2:48:37] in one church
[2:48:41] and be fed.
[2:48:45] They will hop from one church to another
[2:48:49] church.
[2:48:52] You you they come pray for you.
[2:48:55] Ah you enjoy your sing. The moment now
[2:48:58] they are inviting the preacher.
[2:49:04] Where are they going? To another church
[2:49:08] to play again for money.
[2:49:12] two musicians in this church.
[2:49:16] Anyone who ever does that,
[2:49:18] you will never be allowed to play here.
[2:49:24] &gt;&gt; Musicians,
[2:49:26] we believe you are gifted. But you must
[2:49:29] sit down and also be fed on the word.
[2:49:35] You must grow. We are not serving God
[2:49:38] for money.
[2:49:40] Even a preacher, we're not preaching for
[2:49:43] money.
[2:49:45] &gt;&gt; You see us traveling here, traveling
[2:49:47] there,
[2:49:49] brethren. If we wanted money,
[2:49:52] we had better opportunities in the big
[2:49:54] churches where we were.
[2:49:57] Some of us we were favored there.
[2:50:00] But my God is grace. He brought the
[2:50:03] message to us.
[2:50:05] So what is the thing?
[2:50:07] Amen. That is firing us up. Amen. It is
[2:50:11] the word, the truth.
[2:50:14] It is firing us up.
[2:50:17] Amen. That's why we speak many times as
[2:50:19] if we are dying.
[2:50:22] What is it? What do you think is the
[2:50:24] problem?
[2:50:26] It is something on our soul
[2:50:28] that is telling us preacher
[2:50:31] is a burden for soul.
[2:50:34] a burden for the truth.
[2:50:37] May God help us and keep us that way.
[2:50:41] But you see Balam, you know, desire to
[2:50:44] have the money and the power that came
[2:50:47] with.
[2:50:50] And so he tried his best
[2:50:53] to c Israel,
[2:50:55] but he could not cast Israel. That's why
[2:50:58] I believe the true people of God
[2:51:02] can never be cast.
[2:51:07] I can never be cast. Tell your neighbor,
[2:51:10] I can never be cast. I can never be
[2:51:12] cast. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:51:15] &gt;&gt; I amable.
[2:51:19] I am beyond a curse.
[2:51:21] Why? Because I am a blessing.
[2:51:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus. The Bible said they shall
[2:51:29] be a blessing
[2:51:31] in thy seed. Amen. I'll bless you. You
[2:51:35] know we are the seed of Abraham
[2:51:38] by faith in Christ.
[2:51:42] We are a blessing and the world is
[2:51:44] blessed because of us.
[2:51:47] When we leave this world, the
[2:51:50] tribulations will come down.
[2:51:53] The fire of God will come down.
[2:51:55] You are the grace of the world today.
[2:51:59] The world should watch out.
[2:52:02] The moment you are out of that, the
[2:52:05] tribulation will begin.
[2:52:07] But brother, sister, we are here not to
[2:52:11] be defeated. We are here to defeat
[2:52:14] Satan.
[2:52:16] We are here to overcome Satan. We cannot
[2:52:20] be cast.
[2:52:22] Hallelujah.
[2:52:24] Hallelujah.
[2:52:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:52:28] &gt;&gt; And so Bam tried to cast them.
[2:52:31] He could not do it.
[2:52:33] &gt;&gt; He failed to find a way
[2:52:36] to cast them.
[2:52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:40] And he tried to bring always looks down
[2:52:43] on the unorganized and either way by
[2:52:45] determination they bring them into an
[2:52:47] organization or they destroy them when
[2:52:49] they they won't come into the
[2:52:50] organization.
[2:52:52] the spirit of Balam.
[2:52:57] That's always the purpose.
[2:52:59] So Balam now said, "How am I going to do
[2:53:02] this one? Because I need this money. I
[2:53:04] need this money. I need it."
[2:53:07] You know what he did? He said,
[2:53:12] "I have an idea."
[2:53:15] So what's the idea? Let these people. If
[2:53:19] I can't cast them,
[2:53:22] I'll make their God cast them
[2:53:26] by them doing what their God doesn't
[2:53:28] like.
[2:53:30] I'll bring them into idolatry
[2:53:34] and fornication.
[2:53:38] You see, that's a tactic of the devil
[2:53:42] is the way of balam.
[2:53:45] You are so special in the hand of God.
[2:53:48] God can't c you. No one can c you. But
[2:53:52] the devil knows if you can leave
[2:53:56] your place.
[2:53:59] So Bam got Israel to fornication.
[2:54:03] And then brother Bam asks a question. Do
[2:54:06] you know that physical fornication
[2:54:09] is actually the very same spirit that
[2:54:11] lies in organiz or organized religion?
[2:54:21] I say that the spirit of fornication is
[2:54:23] the spirit of organization.
[2:54:26] And all fornicators will have their
[2:54:28] place in the lake of fire.
[2:54:32] Fire.
[2:54:33] May God save you from that.
[2:54:36] That is what God thinks of organization.
[2:54:39] That's also what God thinks of
[2:54:40] fornicators.
[2:54:43] And all fornicators
[2:54:45] will have their place in the lake of
[2:54:46] fire.
[2:54:48] Yes sir. The whole and her daughters
[2:54:51] will be in the lake of fire.
[2:54:54] Denominations are not of God.
[2:54:59] They never have been and never will be.
[2:55:03] It's a wrong spirit that separates the
[2:55:05] people of God into hierarchy and laty.
[2:55:14] A wrong spirit that separates the people
[2:55:16] from the people.
[2:55:20] You know we have arch deacon
[2:55:25] you know priest
[2:55:28] reverend
[2:55:32] bishop
[2:55:34] bishop
[2:55:36] pope
[2:55:39] cardinal whatever
[2:55:41] those kind of hierarchy
[2:55:45] are not of god
[2:55:49] you see spirit of denomination.
[2:55:51] It separates the people from the the
[2:55:53] hierarchy from the lady.
[2:55:59] Therefore along it makes you feel that
[2:56:02] the man of God is almost gone.
[2:56:06] you you are just here
[2:56:13] and that's why you have seen even in
[2:56:16] this country
[2:56:20] some people
[2:56:21] actually bowing
[2:56:25] to the men of God.
[2:56:28] Have you not seen it?
[2:56:30] What is it? spirit of organized religion
[2:56:35] is the same spirit of fornication,
[2:56:38] spirit of idolatry.
[2:56:42] You see, and the message has actually
[2:56:45] set us free from that.
[2:56:49] He said, "Come out of my people."
[2:56:53] You know, it separates the people from
[2:56:54] the people.
[2:56:56] That's what organizations and
[2:56:58] denominations do.
[2:57:00] In organizing they separate themselves
[2:57:02] from the word
[2:57:05] and they bring themselves
[2:57:08] into spiritual adultery.
[2:57:12] That is why they will follow their men
[2:57:16] even when their men leave the world.
[2:57:20] Brother, sister, we are not following
[2:57:23] blindly men.
[2:57:26] We are following men who are following
[2:57:28] Christ.
[2:57:30] That is the narrow way.
[2:57:33] Don't put your eyes on me.
[2:57:35] Don't put your eyes on your cardinal.
[2:57:38] Put your eyes on Christ.
[2:57:42] Don't put it on anybody else.
[2:57:45] Don't even put it on the prophet.
[2:57:48] Don't even put on the pastor
[2:57:50] because we are all men.
[2:57:54] We are all men
[2:57:57] and flesh and blood will not inherit the
[2:58:00] kingdom.
[2:58:03] But put your eyes on Jesus Christ
[2:58:08] and Jesus Christ
[2:58:10] &gt;&gt; is the word.
[2:58:11] Praise God.
[2:58:14] Let me show you something here. Um if
[2:58:17] you can put up Numbers 25.
[2:58:21] And as you are putting up numbers 25,
[2:58:25] someone read for me 1 Corinthians 10:7.
[2:58:46] Neither be ye idolattors as were some of
[2:58:49] them as it is written the people sat
[2:58:50] down to eat drink and rose up to play.
[2:58:53] Neither let us commit fornication as
[2:58:54] some of them committed and fell in one
[2:58:56] dead three and 20,000.
[2:58:59] That is 1 Corinthians 10:7.
[2:59:07] [Music]
[2:59:14] So
[2:59:29] yeah, go ahead.
[2:59:32] Yes.
[2:59:43] Now if you want listen church listen if
[2:59:46] you want to follow this story in numbers
[2:59:49] the Bible here okay okay look when when
[2:59:52] you come here in first Corinthians
[2:59:56] all of you just look up here
[2:59:58] in 1 Corinthians 7
[3:00:02] Paul is warning the Corinthians
[3:00:05] and is telling them don't be idolators
[3:00:10] and also don't foricate
[3:00:14] because if you do
[3:00:16] you are you are going to fall just like
[3:00:18] they fail he says 20 2300
[3:00:23] they die
[3:00:26] and this is the New Testament
[3:00:28] he's quoting numbers 23
[3:00:32] this is what happened in the story of of
[3:00:34] of Moab and and Balam and
[3:00:40] let us read it up to verses um somewhere
[3:00:42] there. Let us read numbers 251.
[3:00:46] And Israel abim brother you have the
[3:00:48] scripture up here. And Israel abim and
[3:00:52] the people began to commit wardom with
[3:00:54] the daughters of Moab. And they called
[3:00:56] the people unto the sacrifices of the go
[3:00:58] of their gods. And the people did eat
[3:01:00] and bowed their down to their gods. And
[3:01:03] Israel joined himself unto Balpia. And
[3:01:06] the angel of the Lord was kindled
[3:01:08] against Israel.
[3:01:32] I always believe
[3:01:35] you know like I was giving an example of
[3:01:37] musicians.
[3:01:40] If you're a musician or a singer or
[3:01:42] whatever
[3:01:44] and you go to serve on an altar that is
[3:01:46] not glorifying Christ
[3:01:51] You are doing idolatry.
[3:01:54] You're doing just idolatry
[3:01:58] because you are serving on false altars.
[3:02:04] That's true. I wish I could explain it
[3:02:06] more.
[3:02:08] And the children of Israel, they went
[3:02:10] into worship
[3:02:12] with Balpia
[3:02:14] rather, you know, the worship of
[3:02:18] and they went and joined together with
[3:02:20] the with the Moabites.
[3:02:23] We are not of them.
[3:02:26] We cannot be of them.
[3:02:28] You know the voice of this message, the
[3:02:30] voice of the angel says in our
[3:02:31] generation,
[3:02:33] come out of her my people. Be not
[3:02:36] partakers of
[3:02:40] many times you find yourself even on
[3:02:42] your TV, you are glued.
[3:02:47] What are you looking for there?
[3:02:49] Can I prophesy? Can I prophesy? Can I
[3:02:51] prophesy? And some of you are watching
[3:02:53] those kind.
[3:02:56] And when you come here DVF,
[3:02:59] you feel bored.
[3:03:01] But pastor does not prophesy, prophesy.
[3:03:04] You are going there fornicating
[3:03:06] spiritually.
[3:03:09] And that's not your food.
[3:03:13] Your food is the word.
[3:03:17] You need to feed on the right kind of
[3:03:19] food.
[3:03:20] You need to filter what you listen to.
[3:03:25] &gt;&gt; Not everything is a food. Not everything
[3:03:28] is ego food.
[3:03:31] We are eos.
[3:03:34] Hallelujah. Am I preaching to believers
[3:03:36] here today? We are eos.
[3:03:39] Feed on the word. On the word, on the
[3:03:41] word, on the word.
[3:03:43] Oh pastor, I don't believe in the
[3:03:44] supernatural.
[3:03:46] The Bible says the son shall follow them
[3:03:48] that believe.
[3:03:53] It should follow you as an individual.
[3:03:57] Amen. Hallelujah. How many have seen
[3:04:01] supernatural in their lives here? Raise
[3:04:02] up your hand.
[3:04:05] Look at all these hands. If you've not
[3:04:07] seen supernatural,
[3:04:09] the problem is with you.
[3:04:12] Amen.
[3:04:13] &gt;&gt; But supernatural
[3:04:15] follows the believers
[3:04:18] every day of their life
[3:04:20] until we are changed.
[3:04:24] But the path we are going is not as easy
[3:04:27] as you think it is.
[3:04:30] It is difficult.
[3:04:32] It is narrow.
[3:04:35] I'm sorry if you don't like it.
[3:04:38] But those who like it, you will receive
[3:04:41] eternal life.
[3:04:46] Hallelujah.
[3:04:46] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[3:04:48] &gt;&gt; See here they went in and and and began
[3:04:51] committing wardom
[3:04:54] with the daughters of Moab
[3:04:56] and they called you know even this kind
[3:04:58] of parties.
[3:05:01] Can you imagine imagine a believer a
[3:05:04] younger man going to parties with a
[3:05:06] non-believer.
[3:05:09] By the way, can I talk about this?
[3:05:12] It's okay. Talk about it. I hope all of
[3:05:14] you will not leave the church.
[3:05:17] And those of you who are dozing, come
[3:05:18] in.
[3:05:21] Stand inside. Deacons. Bring them in. I
[3:05:23] want them to hear. You know, the devil
[3:05:25] is very wise. The younger men, he makes
[3:05:26] them do when they're going to hear
[3:05:28] things which will help.
[3:05:32] Make sure everybody's inside.
[3:05:40] So you see here when we talk about
[3:05:42] parties
[3:05:44] you find a believers are not supposed to
[3:05:47] go on parties of nonbeliever
[3:05:56] as long as
[3:05:59] I always tell them my family
[3:06:02] invite me as long as you're not going to
[3:06:05] play worldly music.
[3:06:07] And there is no alcohol.
[3:06:10] That is if I have time I'll come.
[3:06:14] That's the truth. Me a believer. Yeah.
[3:06:18] How how would you how would you think of
[3:06:19] me?
[3:06:21] &gt;&gt; If you found me because it's my relative
[3:06:26] invited me to to to go to the party
[3:06:30] relative. No problem.
[3:06:32] So you go. Then they begin drinking
[3:06:35] alcohol.
[3:06:36] And then you pastor they give you soda.
[3:06:39] This one is pastor. Even you they will
[3:06:41] call you pastor because you know these
[3:06:43] days they call pastor. Everybody who is
[3:06:44] a Christian
[3:06:47] is pastor. Give them.
[3:06:50] And then now after that
[3:06:53] then they the way they dressed you you
[3:06:56] went in as a very younger holy brother
[3:07:00] you know who's filled with the spirit
[3:07:02] and they begin removing all the spirit
[3:07:04] out of you
[3:07:06] the way they dressed you begin to become
[3:07:09] lustful in your mind
[3:07:11] you begin to look around and then all of
[3:07:14] a sudden they're dancing saying brother
[3:07:16] come
[3:07:18] just for a moment
[3:07:20] So you are saying but you are there also
[3:07:25] and then before you know it you know
[3:07:27] you're beginning to shake you
[3:07:30] before you know it you know you say it's
[3:07:33] okay I can stand after all I'm not
[3:07:36] squeezing like them I'm just this side
[3:07:40] a brother a sister
[3:07:43] &gt;&gt; which music are you dancing to
[3:07:46] by the way by dancing to worldly music.
[3:07:51] It is idolatry.
[3:07:54] The spirit of balam has entered you
[3:07:58] pastor. That is very hard.
[3:08:01] It is the narrow way.
[3:08:04] Christianity is the narrow way.
[3:08:09] Praise God.
[3:08:11] He said that is so hard for younger
[3:08:14] people. Are you the only one who is
[3:08:17] young?
[3:08:19] There are others who are young in your
[3:08:20] generation and they are not doing what
[3:08:23] you're doing which means you too can be
[3:08:26] delivered from it.
[3:08:29] You know that's what happened here
[3:08:32] believers went to parties of
[3:08:33] non-believers
[3:08:36] that's why even on our parties on our
[3:08:38] parties
[3:08:40] we should not compromise
[3:08:43] oh brother your wedding very soon
[3:08:46] yes don't compromise
[3:08:49] always by the way when you're planning
[3:08:51] brethren
[3:08:52] whenever you plan to have a wedding
[3:08:55] or any party you as a believer you
[3:08:59] Select your music.
[3:09:03] Select your music.
[3:09:05] Whatever DJ you hire, that's okay.
[3:09:08] Give him that music. Tell him if you
[3:09:10] play anything different.
[3:09:13] I will not pay you.
[3:09:17] And your friends who are worldly,
[3:09:21] let them come to a believer.
[3:09:25] Let them see how we do it.
[3:09:28] We can also be happy with our music.
[3:09:32] Hallelujah. Amen. We have good music
[3:09:34] also.
[3:09:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, he has done it again.
[3:09:40] You know, and we dance and we we are
[3:09:42] happy.
[3:09:43] &gt;&gt; We don't need the worldly music.
[3:09:46] We don't need worldly music. We should
[3:09:49] have our own music.
[3:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:09:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[3:09:56] You control, have dominion
[3:09:59] on your own parties.
[3:10:01] And when they invite you to their
[3:10:02] parties,
[3:10:04] well, go as long as there is no alcohol
[3:10:07] and and and beer parties and you know
[3:10:09] those kind of music.
[3:10:17] Praise God. What we have
[3:10:21] is very important. We should guard it
[3:10:23] with our life.
[3:10:27] You cannot on Saturday you cannot go to
[3:10:29] a beer party
[3:10:31] and on Sunday you come here and you
[3:10:33] don't do
[3:10:36] there are many spirits fighting you
[3:10:41] even find some believers going to
[3:10:46] go to bust
[3:10:50] &gt;&gt; I don't know how they call in English
[3:10:51] &gt;&gt; busting
[3:10:54] We don't know how they call it. Anyways,
[3:10:57] a believer shouldn't go on such on such
[3:10:58] things.
[3:11:02] You know, it is it is Jesus who did that
[3:11:04] on the cross
[3:11:07] and people go there, they begin vulgar
[3:11:09] words and
[3:11:11] doing some traditional kind of things
[3:11:14] and you you are also among them.
[3:11:20] May God have mercy.
[3:11:23] These things I'm speaking about are very
[3:11:24] important brethren.
[3:11:26] And and when when when this man saw
[3:11:31] there is no way he can catch them. He
[3:11:33] say I will take them in the parties with
[3:11:37] Moab.
[3:11:39] Many of them are young people. They will
[3:11:41] like it.
[3:11:43] So you find brother David
[3:11:46] sister.
[3:11:49] They are there. And I said brother David
[3:11:52] because it's a Jewish name.
[3:11:55] Now there might be a David here.
[3:11:59] Oh brother
[3:12:01] and sister.
[3:12:04] Oh brother whatever. What's your name?
[3:12:08] Whatever. Sometimes we speak names and
[3:12:10] you know someone can be offended
[3:12:13] and you find them there.
[3:12:16] They were there at that time. So they
[3:12:19] began dancing
[3:12:21] and you know there is something about
[3:12:23] alcohol
[3:12:25] and music
[3:12:27] it has the same spirit.
[3:12:31] &gt;&gt; Alcohol will make you do what you can
[3:12:34] you would not do ordinarily.
[3:12:38] Music will make you behave the way you
[3:12:40] would not behave normally
[3:12:46] cuz those things touch your spirit.
[3:12:50] So they went there and they were drunk
[3:12:52] and the music and the alcohol and the
[3:12:55] Sunday. So they began doing dancing in a
[3:12:58] funny way. These are people who are who
[3:13:01] who had gone through the pit of fire.
[3:13:05] seen God. They seen miracles. They were
[3:13:09] moving with Moses, a prophet and God.
[3:13:12] Oh, the Holy Ghost was with them. But as
[3:13:15] they were moving, they couldn't cast
[3:13:17] them.
[3:13:19] Hallelujah. But now when when they took
[3:13:22] them in that scenario,
[3:13:25] they defeated them.
[3:13:28] They started also enjoying.
[3:13:31] You know I always see when we are moving
[3:13:32] somewhere
[3:13:34] and where is El
[3:13:37] is he here
[3:13:39] you know he's there listening sometimes
[3:13:42] you know we listen to music
[3:13:45] one time as music came on
[3:13:48] he said
[3:13:50] daddy is that good song I said no okay
[3:13:57] but that's how the body is
[3:14:00] you see Even if you're a believer, you
[3:14:03] have the body.
[3:14:05] You cannot claim your body doesn't like
[3:14:06] it.
[3:14:09] And you know when you are singing a
[3:14:11] Christian song,
[3:14:13] you know, you will dance in a certain
[3:14:15] way.
[3:14:17] But those worldly songs
[3:14:20] are very songs. They will make you
[3:14:23] remove your the devil in you.
[3:14:28] And then before you know it, You are
[3:14:31] dancing in a way and
[3:14:33] you're shaking yourself.
[3:14:38] &gt;&gt; What's happening?
[3:14:42] Something which has have been awakened.
[3:14:46] And these believers, they did not plan.
[3:14:50] But before they knew it,
[3:14:53] they had began pairing, pairing,
[3:14:54] pairing.
[3:14:57] Do you know how many?
[3:14:59] 23,000
[3:15:01] people
[3:15:04] and God knocked out one by one,
[3:15:08] one by one
[3:15:10] send the spirit of death
[3:15:13] die
[3:15:15] 23 and he was still continuing.
[3:15:19] But there was a brother who had a zeal
[3:15:22] of the Lord. His name was Finance.
[3:15:27] He quickly ran Because there was a
[3:15:30] brother who came and and you had a more
[3:15:33] crowd
[3:15:35] and they were laughing laughing
[3:15:38] and they even came before Moses
[3:15:41] and before the congregation
[3:15:44] trying to make you know their kind of
[3:15:45] funny kind of love
[3:15:48] and
[3:15:50] you know passing by and as they were
[3:15:52] going in the other room
[3:15:55] you know there was a man this younger
[3:15:57] man I laughed
[3:16:00] Hallelujah.
[3:16:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:16:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:16:03] &gt;&gt; Fin came out. Amen. and he picked a
[3:16:06] javelin
[3:16:07] and he quickly ran to this brother
[3:16:12] and he pierced his back
[3:16:15] and and and you know the javelin went
[3:16:18] through even the woman
[3:16:21] and they died and the anger of God
[3:16:25] was quenched
[3:16:27] and God told Moses if it was not for
[3:16:30] that
[3:16:32] I would have finished everybody. Let me
[3:16:34] tell you if God hates something,
[3:16:38] God hates fornication
[3:16:40] and God hates idolatry.
[3:16:46] If you go to
[3:16:48] idolatry,
[3:16:53] if you go to you going to idolatry. If
[3:16:56] you go to funerals, you are going into
[3:16:59] idolatry.
[3:16:59] &gt;&gt; No my brother, not funerals, my brother.
[3:17:01] You have to interpret it properly. It is
[3:17:03] not a funeral.
[3:17:05] funeral busting.
[3:17:07] Whatever it is,
[3:17:09] &gt;&gt; you know that's idolatry.
[3:17:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[3:17:16] We are born again.
[3:17:19] This is the old time salvation. This is
[3:17:22] a narrow way.
[3:17:24] Hallelujah. Amen. That they will invite
[3:17:26] you, I'm sorry, I don't attend such
[3:17:28] parties.
[3:17:33] We are also Christians.
[3:17:36] I'm a different Christian.
[3:17:38] Amen.
[3:17:40] &gt;&gt; You see,
[3:17:42] as I'm finishing this part here,
[3:17:45] uh, you know, I think I'll just spare
[3:17:47] you because they also, brother, they
[3:17:49] need to make some announcements on the
[3:17:50] youth cup and everything. So, I'll just
[3:17:51] finish with this part and then maybe
[3:17:55] on I will speak on it on Wednesday.
[3:17:58] See, I want you to see the scripture in
[3:18:00] Revelation 17. If you can turn,
[3:18:05] &gt;&gt; Revelation 17.
[3:18:08] &gt;&gt; And there came one of the seven angels,
[3:18:11] which had seven vials, and talked with
[3:18:13] me, saying unto me, Come, I will show
[3:18:15] unto thee the judgment of the great war
[3:18:18] that sitth upon many waters, with whom
[3:18:20] the kings of the earth have committed
[3:18:21] fornication, and the inhabitants of the
[3:18:24] earth have been made drunk with the wine
[3:18:26] of her fornication. So he carried me
[3:18:28] away in the spirit into the wilderness.
[3:18:30] And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet
[3:18:33] colored beast full of names of blasphemy
[3:18:36] having seven heads and 10 horns. And a
[3:18:39] woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet
[3:18:42] color and decked with gold and precious
[3:18:44] stones and pearls and having golden a
[3:18:46] golden cup in her hand uh full of
[3:18:48] abominations and filthiness of our
[3:18:50] fornication. And upon her forehead was a
[3:18:52] name written, Mystery, Babylon the
[3:18:56] Great, the mother of harotss and
[3:18:58] abominations of the earth. Well, you can
[3:19:01] read it for the people slowly.
[3:19:17] Amen.
[3:20:03] Praise God. And uh you know the Bible
[3:20:06] speaks about mystery Babylon.
[3:20:09] This is a big subject and we can talk
[3:20:12] about it maybe in the sometime in the
[3:20:14] future
[3:20:15] some something on this line.
[3:20:18] You know Bible talks about this war
[3:20:22] mother of harot.
[3:20:25] Who is she? The great war.
[3:20:27] You know this is a church system.
[3:20:30] The biggest and the first the Roman
[3:20:33] Catholic system.
[3:20:36] Why does the Bible call her a great war?
[3:20:40] Because she she has a wine of
[3:20:44] fornication.
[3:20:47] She has made many get drunk
[3:20:50] in the wine of her fornication.
[3:20:53] What is it? Wrong doctrine,
[3:20:56] wrong worship,
[3:20:58] believing wrong teachings
[3:21:00] that are not in the Bible, believing you
[3:21:03] can pray to a dead person,
[3:21:06] believing in novenas,
[3:21:08] believing in all those things,
[3:21:11] scapulas.
[3:21:12] Oh, if you take a scapul, we
[3:21:15] you will go to purgatory
[3:21:18] until you pray through
[3:21:23] you know and you know they have replaced
[3:21:24] everything in the Bible
[3:21:28] their own traditions and ideas
[3:21:31] it's a big system huge church system
[3:21:35] church system
[3:21:39] she claims to be the one speaking on
[3:21:41] behalf of God
[3:21:43] that's why she's called Catherine
[3:21:46] Catholic means worldwide.
[3:21:51] So Catholic church means worldwide
[3:21:53] church.
[3:21:56] They believe they are the one true
[3:21:57] church.
[3:21:59] You know, you know in the apostles creed
[3:22:01] which they sing
[3:22:03] they say and I believe in the holy
[3:22:05] Catholic church.
[3:22:08] That's what we used to be sing or the
[3:22:11] angry can sing it to because they are
[3:22:14] the daughters.
[3:22:16] They are the ones that the Bible saying
[3:22:18] they are they are, you know, they are
[3:22:20] the daughters because she's the mother.
[3:22:21] They are the daughters.
[3:22:23] [Music]
[3:22:26] Now when you read it, you can't
[3:22:27] understand if you are can
[3:22:31] these are spiritual things.
[3:22:34] The Bible say that this woman was
[3:22:35] drunken with the blood of the saint.
[3:22:40] They they killed millions
[3:22:43] of Christians, fed them to liars
[3:22:47] when they refused to believe their
[3:22:48] false.
[3:22:51] The man who translated the KJV
[3:22:55] was killed by them
[3:22:58] because he translated the Bible. They
[3:23:00] said no one can read the Bible.
[3:23:03] You know many many things happened
[3:23:05] during the day in the dark ages. They
[3:23:08] introduced the trinity doctrine
[3:23:12] to replace the one God of the Bible. And
[3:23:15] you know this was all pagan ideas,
[3:23:20] pagan gods, pagan teachings
[3:23:23] because Rome has never been a Christian
[3:23:25] nation.
[3:23:28] Especially to those of you who have read
[3:23:30] history.
[3:23:32] You know, Rome existed before
[3:23:34] Christianity.
[3:23:37] It was one of the last last empires.
[3:23:42] But the Bible says, you see, when when
[3:23:44] when she got a wound,
[3:23:48] she became wounded
[3:23:51] and then later she revived.
[3:23:55] Listen, she was a a
[3:23:59] an empire political
[3:24:02] but now revived as papa Rome.
[3:24:10] There is no political leader in Rome
[3:24:15] is the papa.
[3:24:18] He has influence all over the world.
[3:24:22] Every American president almost like a a
[3:24:24] mass they have to go to Vatican.
[3:24:29] They own the wealth of the world
[3:24:32] decked with gold and precious stones and
[3:24:35] and you know uh pearls and
[3:24:40] they have a golden cup
[3:24:43] she has in her hand full of abominations
[3:24:46] and filthiness of her.
[3:24:51] What is it? The wrong teachings, the
[3:24:54] wrong ideas, the wrong you know
[3:24:57] sacraments and things which are not
[3:25:01] and many are drunk
[3:25:04] from that car.
[3:25:06] If you tell them that they are wrong,
[3:25:08] they can almost kill. They killed
[3:25:10] millions of Christians.
[3:25:13] And you know what the Bible prophesies
[3:25:15] of the new world order
[3:25:20] that is coming friends. The mark of the
[3:25:23] beast is real.
[3:25:25] But the bride won't be here.
[3:25:27] She'll be long gone.
[3:25:30] That's why we are preaching the word.
[3:25:33] Amen. For us to know who we are. Where
[3:25:36] we are blessed in the word.
[3:25:38] But we do not go in the way of balam.
[3:25:42] One time I'll get it into details and
[3:25:44] speak to you on mystery Bible.
[3:25:48] But friends, the narrow way
[3:25:51] is the hard way, but it's the right way.
[3:25:56] May God help you to walk in the narrow.
[3:26:00] God bless you. Maybe you may be.
[3:26:05] Amen.
[3:26:08] Sorry, I took a little more time.
[3:26:12] But I hope that that was good for your
[3:26:14] soul.
[3:26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:26:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[3:26:27] [Music]
[3:26:30] God sent his son.
[3:26:33] [Music]
[3:26:35] They call him Jesus.
[3:26:39] Yes.
[3:26:40] &gt;&gt; He came to love.

[3:30:02] Lord by an uplifted

[3:30:10] creator of heaven and earth,
[3:30:14] we come before you this afternoon.
[3:30:16] [Music]
[3:30:17] &gt;&gt; I want to thank you for the opportunity
[3:30:19] you have given to us to share your word.
[3:30:23] We do not take it for granted
[3:30:25] that we can still speak the word with
[3:30:27] liberty
[3:30:30] and speak by conviction
[3:30:33] and speak the truth. For the time is
[3:30:36] coming
[3:30:37] when it will no longer be possible.
[3:30:40] But as you have given us the grace,
[3:30:42] Lord, may you also give the grace to the
[3:30:44] hearers
[3:30:46] that Lord will be able to stand with the
[3:30:48] word.
[3:30:49] We'll be able to receive and believe the
[3:30:51] word.
[3:30:52] We'll be able to hold on to the word
[3:30:55] that we will be perfected.
[3:30:58] Father Lord, we know that you said in
[3:31:00] the book of Ephesians.
[3:31:03] You said the five-fold ministry.
[3:31:06] Preach the word for the perfection.
[3:31:10] May you perfect us Lord in Christ. And
[3:31:14] father Lord if there be any need Lord
[3:31:17] spiritual or otherwise
[3:31:20] Lord may you come and meet every need.
[3:31:22] You see the hands that have been lifted
[3:31:24] up.
[3:31:26] you know the needs oh God in their
[3:31:27] hearts.
[3:31:29] May you glorify your name. May you
[3:31:32] magnify your name that they may know you
[3:31:36] are a living God and you never fail.
[3:31:40] Father we thank you because we know that
[3:31:43] it has already been done
[3:31:45] by eyes of faith.
[3:31:48] We give you glory, honor, adoration Lord

[3:32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. You may be seated at
[3:32:03] church.
[3:32:05] Um we we just have um one brother who if
[3:32:09] you could please stay for I'm going to
[3:32:12] limit them. I'm going to be right here.
[3:32:13] So I'll limit them. I I will not it will
[3:32:15] not go beyond 30 minutes.
[3:32:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Martin, I think for about 5
[3:32:20] minutes. Where is he? He has a few
[3:32:22] announcements that he's going to make.
[3:32:26] And um I I think we'll not need to
[3:32:28] stream this part brothers
[3:32:30] unless if you think it is very
[3:32:32] necessary. So but maybe I just wanted to
[3:32:35] say
[3:32:36] as the brother Isaac will be giving us
[3:32:39] updates of the youth camp.
[3:32:44] I want us to know that uh you know you
[3:32:48] notice we have not even announced so
[3:32:50] much.
[3:32:54] We will but not as we usually do
[3:32:58] because we are trying to avoid getting a
[3:33:02] bigger number
[3:33:06] because we the venue we have is small.
[3:33:11] Um the hall can only have maybe how many
[3:33:14] did we have in there brother Isaac last
[3:33:16] time? Brother Martin 500.
[3:33:21] Yeah we had about 500 there. I
[3:33:22] understand. Yeah. 5 5 550.
[3:33:27] So, and and I think it was almost 600
[3:33:30] and many were outside. body welcome.
