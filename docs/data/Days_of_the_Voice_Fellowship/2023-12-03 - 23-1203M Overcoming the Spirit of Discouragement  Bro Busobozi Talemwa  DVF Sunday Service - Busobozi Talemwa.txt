of the Lord amen hallelujah hallelu praise God so we have more visitors that have joined sister M sister Faith from Fort Porto where is she God bless you we welcome all of you that are visiting with us this morning and we trusting that the Lord will indeed bless you and it will be a special day for all of us today amen so uh I bring you greetings from uh our friends brother Amos from Nairobi you ask me to the church uh sister Dina one of us here from Boston she's in um in Boston she has told me several times greet the church and I keep [Music] forgetting praise God and uh also I spoke to Pastor morus from Ethiopia he also sent his greetings and uh uh there are many people who are warming up to come for the Youth meetings are you warming up for our youth meetings we believe we are going to have a wonderful time there's a brother who contacted me uh I think a week ago he told me uh pastors as far as all vegetables is [Music] concerned it's on me he said he said I'm a farmer and uh I I I grow cabbages I grow greens and you know so he said I'm going to uh sponsor the the meetings for you all those things that one is already off our budget so our budget is still huge so if you want to remove something please and and I know that we are asking everyone to contribute the members here we are asking you to contribute 100,000 um and we appreciate there several who have already done their contributions and I want to appreciate you so much for that um so we are asking the others to contribute at at least 50,000 and this amount really especially those who are going to be spending at the venue uh for a night they're asking us to pay 17,000 person so if you if someone is spending there all the three nights that means that they will be spending 51,000 so that means that even the 50,000 we asking them to pay will not be enough for just accommodation and um then of course we have the food uh and and as well as the venue the me venue that we will need to pay for as well so we estimated a minimum amount of 12,000 so that means if someone contributes 50,000 um they have contributed something so where does the rest of the burden go of how much that's a minimum we saying a minimum because it will depend on several things depending on the number of the people that will turn 120 to 140 per person because the food increases in price so depending on the people that will come it will either increase or reduce our cost per person that means the amount of 7 ,000 shs that burden is going on us the [Music] hosts and uh uh there's a there's a there's a brother that sent me 3.5 million Shillings in contribution to the youth meetings and also there is a sister me 2.1 million shs towards the support of the youth me and all these individuals who were part of our assembly and they really moved towards the vision that the Lord has given to us and so uh the next person that will contribute that much can be you so as much as we asking you to give one 100,000 if God gives you a miracle please don't hesitate to contribute a substantive amount it will go a long way in supporting the meeting I was speaking to brother auma from kja and I was telling him you have a lot of cows there you can decide to donate two CS he said yes pastor we can decide to do that but maybe for the future meeting but I think it would be a wonderful thing if you receive the donation of cows from amen and if you have cows you yourself can donate we want two cows for the we believe that God can do anything these are meetings the vision was given to us by the Lord expectant for what the Lord will do in our country among our young people and the younger generation brothers that are coming that are invited to come to minister to the young people they have quite a a good uh amount of experience ministering to the young people all over the world these are are people I could say they are on high demand but for for them to accept our invitation it means that the Lord has something for the young people in not only our country but our region because we are also having quite a good number coming from Kenya in Western Kenya Western Kenya uh in uh thank you in Western Kenya Western Kenya and also in Nairobi Nairobi and so we we in Ethiopia Ethiopia one or two or three I don't know how many will come from there and and and some other countries as well so I believe it's going to be a feasting time I'd like us to be in prayer for those meetings um for the Lord to move in a special way and those who have contributed I don't have the list before me but it's quite several from the church here I want to say God bless you those who have not yet contributed please contribute time is uh first first brother Isaac how many days are we remaining with 39 days 39 days because the dates are 12th to 14th of January so I hope that you'll be encouraged to give amen I I was just given a wedding invitation here and they inviting the whole dvf family uh this is from Brother vent and his wife sister Teddy those are parents of Brother Martin of Toro they inviting you all to the wedding of their children Brother David and sister Mery now Sister Mery is the young sister to brother

righteousness of [Music] God and coming before you this morning we come boldly before your throne of Mercy the throne of grace because we know you have a table spray and you want to encourage [Music] someone Lord you want to do that this morning come and have your way we all want to sit and be fed we all need you grant it I pray in the name of Jesus please be seated God bless God bless you musicians praise God overcoming the spirit of discouragement that's what I'm speaking about this morning now discouragement comes from the word courage the word discouragement is the opposite of [Music] Courage discouragement is losing the courage to continue espcially when we have lost our motivation to [Music] continue when you lose the motivation to press forward you know when you lose because maybe the valley is too step or maybe the valley is too dark and maybe the battle is fierce and then you become discouraged when you are discouraged you cannot overcome when you are discouraged you cannot move forward when you are discouraged you are bound it's not that you don't have potential you still have the potentials within you but when you are discouraged you don't see your potential anymore when you are discouraged you only look at the difficulty you only look at the problem you look at how Fierce the battle is amen you look at how dark it is now I have three daughters and one of themba where is she is she anywhere around here oh right here praise God she's a beautiful young lady but while growing up I noticed among the three of them that there is one thing that disc she's very bold very bold actually she's more confident than her elder sister but there is one thing that discourages and that is Darkness last night power went off you know uh I don't know whether women ever sleep my wife told me in the we hours of the night she came in our room I I was dead asleep I didn't I didn't see her so mothers God bless you let us give a hand to mothers they're wonderful so if shba was in our room because it was dark in her room I don't know how she senses Darkness it's like she has a sensor the moment power goes off even if she was sleeping for two hours she will wake up immediately she senses darkness and she fears Darkness even if she's a strong woman very confident very strong but that one discourages praise God I just gave an example of my daughter because I know I will go back at home and kiss and she'll forget what I but right now it is boiling down in our but each of us here we have things that discourage us although when we are before people want to put up a good face and you don't want people to know that you are discouraged but you know God knows you're discouraged and that's why he gave me this sermon this morning many people get discouraged to continue they don't want to press forward they to press forward because it is too dark because the battle is so Fierce and the motivation to press forward doing those and now this being the first service in this new year in this last month of the old year I'm realizing that we are getting into the new year and many people who had set goals but this year I will do this and this and this and this and this how many here achieved everything they wanted to achieve this year everything how many are a little discouraged that they were not able to achieve what they wanted to [Music] achieve okay those ones are a little discouraged how many are really discouraged because they acheve something God bless you how many are very discouraged all right God bless you this message is for you this morning the ones who are not discouraged the service is dismissed the ones who are discouraged this morning this service is for you this morning and I trust that the Lord will minister to your soul so please pay attention let us see what the Lord has for us and someone asked me the other day actually two or three people ask asked me a question said pastor I've been going through the whole year and I see that you've been preaching a lot of sermons and this time you preach you preach a fresh inspiration how do you get these sermons and I told I said to the person honestly when he asked me I did not know the answer to be and when the second person asked me I I came to think of it I said why are they all asking me the same thing here is what I want to tell you it's not about me or the preacher it is about God and your need God knows your need and that's why he inspires the preacher to preach about your need because God wants to take you out of your situation that's why when you are hearing a preacher preach and he preaching about your condition the preacher knows nothing about your condition but God knows your condition and he's inspiring the preacher to talk about it so you can build Faith come out of it if you understand it say amen and so I was asking the Lord what will I speak about this morning and then you know those words just came in my ears overcoming the spirit of discouragement praise the name of the Lord I I want us to take it this way I will begin in the Old Testament where I want us to see an example of people that were discouraged there many people who have been discouraged in this life some of them prophets others lay members others just Believers people are being discouraged each time it's not a new thing to be discouraged it is a same old story tell the devil is the same old Story the reason why the devil discourages you is because he wants you to give up brother sh can you give me a little more sound my voice is really cracky this morning he wants you to give up that's why he discourage he wants you to give up tell your neighbor he wants you to give up but I'm here this morning as an angel of the Lord to you telling you don't give up don't give up no retreat no surrender the moment you decided you must go through with the thing you must finish the thing you are not going to be like you you are going to be like Jesus when Jesus came down from heaven he came down to the Earth he came determined to die for the siners he was determined and the devil discouraged him many times he even came through his disciple Peter and he told him why do you have to die why why why the moment Jesus realized that was the devil discouraging him he turned to Peter he said get behind me Satan Jesus realized it was not Peter discouraging him there was a spirit behind Peter trying to discourage Jesus from pressing forward brother sister it is not your sister it is not your brother it is not your mother it's not your friend there is a spirit and that spirit is called discouragement so I want to expose that Spirit today and after I've exposed it we all shall be more than conquerors the spirit that spirit is one of the most filthy Spirits even people who are destined for great [Music] things have been tempted by that Spirit of discouragement and Jesus when he was tempted by it he found out he said I'm not going to give up I've gone too far to give back I've gone too far to look back I am not going to give up I wonder how many will say the same thing here today I've gone too far to look back amen I love sister what you posted on the group said I've counted the cost and I've still made up my mind the cost is great but I've still made up my mind not to give up Hallelujah the cost of serving Jesus the cost of living for for the world is very dear very expensive you have to sacrifice but are you made up in your mind not to give in the book of Exodus 5 22 maybe someone is on the brink of giving up let us try to deal with you this morning vers 22 Hallelujah and Moses returned unto the Lord and said Lord what hast thou so evil ined this people why is it that thou Hast sent me for since I came to pharaoh to speak in thy name he has done evil to these people neither has thou delivered thy people at all on Friday we're talking about prayer a Believer overcomes in prayer is Moses praying but when he went before God he was discouraged brother when you are discouraged go in prayer it is prayer that defeats the spirit of discouragement how many believe it if believe it say Amen prayer he went before God in prayer and God his complaint was Lord why have you done this evil before why have you done this the people you have treated them so badly you know God met Moses and he told him go I will deliver the people with a mighty hand just go Moses you are my man I've anointed you I've anointed tell do this side said yeah this is power but he said but I can't speak said don't want to give you he will be your prophet and you be his God you're going to be my mouthpiece meaning if you are God will anything fail will anything fail me are the Creator God God lifts up this and he showed him nothing will be impossible you're going to just go and take the people out it's going to be power it's going to be signs going to be wonders go going to be a go to this mes came with a lot of zeal you know remember those days when you were just starting with a lot of Ze a lot of fire oh my God everybody should not dism everybody should believe you are going on the streets you are telling every this is so powerful and then Moses reached a time everything he did and Pharaoh tightened the nut and he made the children of Israel to suffer even more than before Moses came mes saw that I thought my Ministry was powerful I thought I was delivering this people what just happened heed doing the same still PHA Harden tightened the children of Isel to suffer in a greater way Moses who was on fire he reduced he said there is a problem there is a problem with God do you think that was Moses speaking it was the spirit of disc it was right behind telling him you are God has a problem if he was with you why are the people suffering who do you think is making is PHA it is your God your God has a problem so Moses his heart bed and he came out he said God why are you so evil in treating these people why have you sent me here since I came here I've been speaking to Pharaoh in your name but he has done evil to this people and you God you you have not delivered them so God tell me who is the problem is it me Pharaoh is it you who not delivered them that was the spirit of discouragement trying to discourage the man of God from realizing that God was powerful there is no word there is no word that God has given that he is not intending to fulfill oh my you people help me pre this morning every word that God has given whether by word or by Vision or by dream my prophecy he will accomplish because he's God he is God tell somebody he is God God is God and he never fail he never fails but the people they always listen to that Spirit the spirit of discouragement it will always come and find you in those moments when you are alone it will wait until I finish my sermon and then when you are out there and it will come very what did he say but let us look at the reality how are you sinc how is your life are you overcoming you think you will ever live sin you know you cannot just leave it just give up you know you are a failure it's a very bad spirit and it comes and finds you in those and then you become disced even physically you give up you no longer want to come to church because you are discarded that Spirit can even use people they will come and speak to you things which will discourage whereby you feel you no longer want to go to church you no longer want to hear the preer you know that Spirit can use we saw it used Peter to discourage Jesus Peter a preacher a pastor an apostle he was used by the devil before he received the Holy Spirit the spirit of discouragement it was behind him trying to discourage Jesus but because Jesus was God the devil found his much he found more than a much Jesus is more than a whenever that Spirit of discouragement come let me tell you we have an anchor our anchor holds within Jesus that Jesus is no longer somewhere somewhere somewhere he abides within us he is always there when the Devil comes to discourage us he is always there to combat the devil to defeat the Devil to tell us words of Faith Words which will bring us back to the world and Moses was discouraged he told God how can you do that you have not even delivered your people maybe you also discouraged you are saying for sure God has not delivered when the year was beginning pastor preached to us and he told us about a man called Arnold V how many remember that and he said made a determination to fight for his people and our an winky is our Jesus Christ

to you and tell tell you something ah do you know how bad that person is they did ab and then you feel like what I will never be in touch with them again it's a spirit of discouragement that has now come over you and is in homes it's in families it's in churches it's in society it's everywhere in Proverbs 6: 16 these six things does the Lord hate and seven an Abomination unto him let us look at these things this is connected to the spe of discouragement listen listen now listen please one a proud look [Music] everybody say proud a proud L Church a lying Tong come on repeat after me now I want you to put on your on your lips now all right can we start over again a proud look a lying tongue hands that shake innocent blood and heart that devices Wicked imaginations that be Swift in

hallelujah some of you as I'm speaking to you right now you have bitterness about somebody bitterness is a root that has been planted in your heart by the spirit of discourage a child of God should never at any time have bitterness what is bitterness when you don't want to tolerate even a name of a person who are you saying don't talk to me about that person tired and very I finished up with that one that is a root of bitterness root of bitterness you are bitter in your soul you are bitter in your spirit and you are discouraged about that person we can call it a biasness that's the one that one don't tell me and you you a Believer you are in the church but you are bitter about somebody did you know that even when someone does bad to you or speaks against you if you have true love you will still love [Music] them love SE is not own love is not itself love is not pued up love is is is kind that's not fail that's not fa if there is a brother or a sister in the church that you cannot hug or say I love you from your heart you are not filled with the and you need to be born again did you mean that Pastor yes I me why because you have a root of bitterness Judas came Jesus knew everything but Judas came said Oh my Jesus and Jesus was like oh yes brother Judas and Judas was like and said that's how you betraying me Jesus did not Jesus wasn't [Music] like you don't know I do I know what you're doing you betraying me now you are C no he was like very gentle because he loved you oh Judas so my brother before you go that's how you have betrayed me brother sister have you reach that level whereby you will even love your enemy even when someone goes and speaks something against you you still have no B for if there is one thing that God gave me since I received the Holy Spirit was love in my heart I have not bit against anyone in the world I remember there is one day I had I had bitterness in my heart and I said oh God but I I thought I have the Holy Ghost said oh God help me and I was preaching and I was preacher and I was traveling and and I thought I he had the Holy Spirit but maybe he had received emotions of I don't know but let me tell you that's why we should every time receive experience experence and then one day I was in China in the city of shenzen and I was feeling this bitterness in my heart about this person what they did to me how they did it how they plan it and then all of a sudden I was like oh God this person didn't mean it the Holy Spirit began conving he didn't mean it I saw this Chinese people who can't even speak my language but they love me they and then I was like oh one brother picked up the picture brother with a pill of fire and he was showing me without of course speaking that do you know this man and do you believe this pill of fire Jesus Christ the one who was with the whatever in the Bible you had the Bible they showed me I said yes he [Music] me so I was walking up I said oh God I experienced love I said God who am I to have bitterness against anybody friends it was that day that the Holy Spirit visited me on that street in Shen and power a lot of love in my and the first words I spoke while tears were coming down it was real friends I said I forgive and right in there I started feeling an inspiration coming to me I ran to my room picked up a pen started writing and we've sng it several times when I need to forgive all those who hurt me I couldn't do it even to those that haunt me but when is great found me so riched poor and blind I couldn't help it but to say I for and from that moment I that I was

maybe they they are my they are enemies to me but I'm enemies have no enemies can we each of us say that do you love everybody no no be real now let be real now let's be sincere now if there is someone you don't like very much do you know what you need to do do you know you can decide to love them truly from your heart and just say I forgive them what they did to me I forgive them if you hold bitterness in your heart your heart will get cancers and you will die brother sister you need to have nothing but love in your heart since Jesus came into my oh my I can go on that line for long

know do you know now when everybody comes to church they all clouded that of discouragement that brother how can he do that you are thinking about he but she's about how can that sister do that that Spirit can even break a a home can break a family can break marriage can break a church and when you see people clouded with that Spirit of this showing this C among Breen just run from them and pray for them don't be a participant stand for what is Right stand for the word of God and you will receive the blessing of God now I know I've taken quite some that scripture but that has been the heart of this Summer that you overcome this seven things you have already overcome the speed of disc now in the next few minutes let us let us continue with the with the Israel and then we shall conclude in the in in Numbers Chapter [Music] 13 Moses in numbers 13: 20 T the spies to the uh uh tells the spies to be of good courage and let us see their report on their return after Moses told them be of good courage go you can take the land numbers 13:2 everyone turn there if you can and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel and to the Wilderness of Peron to Cades and brought back word unto them and said unto the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land can you read that [Music] so they admitted the land had fruits the land was good the land was am as as God had said verse 27 and they told him and said we came unto the land with thou sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of [Music] it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are world and very great and moreover we saw the children of an [Music] there the aites dwell in the land of the South and the Hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan I have a question what what was um what was the work that Moses gave these spies does anybody know what was the work they were supposed to do they were supposed to go and do what sorry and give the report but now what kind of spy they wanted they was to go and see if everything is the way God said it was if the land is good flow with milk and and whether everything is there and whether they will take the land so they came back said it is true the land is there it's good even the fruits are here but now whatever they were going to say was unnecessary you know the americ here the amorites the the of an canites it's very difficult and while they were speaking CED the people in verse 30 he said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to before spoke everybody at first when they saw the fruit com the land is there the is there let us what they have to say is there it's good it's with everybody was excited but there are also Amit an and very difficult they became discouraged it was a false witness that delivered lies wait did I say lies yes but was it not realities it was real but it was lies because it's not what God say do you get it brother am if you got it say amen and had them speaking their Liv he said wait wait wait everybody shut up I don't want to know anything let us get up at once and take the land we are able to overcome the 10 were clouded with the strength of their [Music] enemies you know that the promise became so de before they I'm coming to the climax of this so don't don't shut up on me now follow me closely here the the promise became so de in their eyes because of how big their enemy was and as a result they gave a very discouraging testimony and I want to say we are given a promise we are to focus on the promise tell your neighbor we are to focus on the promise not the realities of impossibilities they are realities and they look impossible we are not to focus on that like say let us go up at once and possess the land we are able to overcome it and now look at this the the others did not shut up they continued with their discouraging real I wish you would get that [Music] word are you hearing me Church verse 31 and the man that went up with him said we are not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we reality number one and they brought up an evil report of the land an evil reports oh my God why was it evil because is not what God Said the land thought that which we have gone to to search it is a land that eats up the inhabitants there and all the people that we saw in it are men of great sture and there we saw the Giants the sons of anak which come to the to of which come of the Giants and we are in our own in their own sight as [Music] grasshoppers the facts we are now on the drawing board let us begin to draw the facts fact number one the canites were stronger than the Israelites if it is true you say Amen the canites were men of great sture the sons of Anna were giants Israelis looked like little grass is that correct however these were facts according to the physical eyes I don't know if somebody's get these were facts according to what they were saying to repeat these facts is to give an evil report of the land that was the spirit of discouragement being breathed on the [Music] people they had to take God at his word they did not have to look at the facts can we bring it down to today as we conclude the facts today I try to list them here my page was filling up I couldn't [Music] finish the fact is that you may not be highly educated is that a fact today among many Christians is that not true is that not a fact you may not even know how to write your name don't we have many Christians like that not knowing how to write your name all right that's a fact reality you may not be rich brother Enoch are you rich brother Andrew are you rich they are not answering me sister f are you rich are you you confused at least I trust someone here are you rich who's a rich man here I'm trying to find someone yes my sister you're [Music] smiling all these people are you rich God bless you brother come here come here this brother is Rich God bless you with a lot of riches in Jesus name that's true is what God God's word said but now can we surely the reality real sinc speaking are you rich no no God bless you now I just discouraged you you said you are rich you came here on fire walking like a rich man and then all of the sudden you said no I'm not rich you are the one who said you is it me who forced you to say I simply asked you to say the reality and you said the reality that's how the reality is and that's how the devil discourages after the P say you are rich the word of God says the blessing of God it makes you rich you say amen I am rich [Music] you see so the fact is the reality is we are poor that's the reality that's the fact I'm sorry if you are rich but even if you are rich you are poor because that money is nothing and the fact is many Believers don't have much money the fact is even in our own assembly many people don't eat all [Music] meals is not not is that not so that's the reality the we know this things that's the fact all right another fact is that many of us come from a very poor background we are not only poor our but even we come from a very [Music] poor you don't even remember who drove a that's true now another reality is that many of you you are the devil pulls you deep in sin that when you're not in church out there The Temptations are real they are real I'm not supposed to lie but sinc how can I I need to tell a God will give Mery that's the reality it is here it's on the ground you know it God knows it the devil knows it those three you can't lie is the reality and that's why when the Devil comes he comes to say what did you say that you're born again let us beere what what kind of life that do you live can you say you don't tell Li can you say you don't have say the truth young people if I call you here who who can I call let me and I ask you that brother you don't have do you say amen I don't I'll call someone here I'll call someone here right now and we ask them after they tell us yeah pastor but say the reality to be sincere to look down even if they say yeah yeah still they say it when they looking down because now it's the fact it's the reality the devil knows that you know it and God knows it it's the reality oh we don't have to be sick but the reality is even as I speak many of you are sick and are taking medicine how many are on medic right now feel bad raise up your look around we are sick now that's only a few there are many here who have not raised up their hand if I was to tell them to be sincere they will still raise up on medication I'm telling you the facts now the other fact we are outnumbered that is true in many ways as as far as the church is concerned the Pentecostals are bigger as far as your enemies they're bigger that's the reality the religions and denominations and we are few now can I can I continue going [Music] down some of you the month just ended it is start December the reality is you may not have money to pay your [Music] rent in a wrong crowd today that's the reality right now I'm preaching but you are wondering where will I get rent how will I I will not pick up her call or his call it's the reality you are laughing because you know the reality some of you have business the reality is the business may not be going this is the reality some of you who are married we are now going in marriage let me drop in something the truth is the reality your marriage can I say it your marriage may be in shuts now the one who are not are going to begin looking at you see that's the truth some of you you may be jobless praise God and you have no job and you know is the truth that's why you don't even come to church sometimes because you have no transport for the church our land it is very expensive is that a reality is it is it not a fact it is even going higher more and more expensive the reality is if we continue collecting money the reality is we may buy in a minimum of 10 years people are now disced but fact is a reality reality I want to finish the list is so long to the students who just came back some a few of you you are sure your father will pay for you but many of you can we talk about your reality the reality to you you don't even know whether you will go back the next time or whether you will have school Fe and because of all you right now in reality you may be totally discouraged and that's why you are very quiet because I know I've discouraged all of you I've reminded you of your healing wounds the pastor had preached to us and made us feel everything he has reminded us yeah for sure I don't even have t where will it even come from for sure my business is coming here I don't know I even get ever get married the reality is you have tried to look for sisters and maybe some have refused Brothers am I preaching to you now is the reality and sisters some of you the matter the truth of it is you have waited until you are tired until you have even started asking questions can sisters also propose because you you have waited and you tired how long for sure now friends in conclusion those are the facts but those facts which you just heard me say are the same facts which do 10 men say about the land when they saw the land with their eyes they said the land that its own people the land has giant the land is difficult the land is it is impossible for us to take it but came out do we have hallelujah amen he arose and he said what are you talking about let us go at and take the land so we are more than able take not because of your fake realities I don't see those Realties I see the realities of the world the promises of God the Covenant of God that one never fail the word of God says and I have very many listen here when I started writing promises I could not finish also but let me tell you some of his promises the word of God says we shall be heads and not how many believe that we shall L to the Nations that a poor man Le to the Nations no it is a promise God promis to make you rich so rich that you will Le to the Nations not your brother or sistering to Uganda there are some rich individuals who come from America and they have been coming here to try to Lear to Uganda you are supposed to be the one you you now some of these promises you will die without accomplishing them not because it is not promising but because you either not believe it or you did not attain that level of faith if it is revealed to you then you shall have iten amen the Bible says we are Overcomers in to them that shall overcome I am the overcome in this generation I must overcome that's a promise it's a covenant the Bible says we are sons of God not we shall be but we are right now I am a Son of God I'm a daughter you a daughter of God the Bible says you are healthy his stripes you are hereen to all of you that are currently taking medicine I don't care whether for cancer diabetes malaria I want pronounce to you the promises of the word of God by his stri you are healed I don't care about the reality I care about the word of God by his stripes you are heal the promise says he that is in you is greater is greater than the anarchist the canites and those who are in Egypt than those that are in the world he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world someone ought to stand up and say I accept that I receive that for me the Bible says we have a great cloud of witnesses so we may look like we are alone but we are not alone we are not alone we outnumber the devil we outn our enemy we outnumber them that's why the Bible says they shall fall by our by our left and right side who does that he that is in us the Bible says the angel of the Lord is always around us always around us oh my I'm never tired of the promises promise says the Holy Spirit abides in me hallelu so when I'm discouraged he encourages me when I'm discouraged he strengthens me he leads me he guides me even when I walk through the valley of the Shad I will fear no evil why because you are with me he's with you all the time all the time he can never leave you you may say you are weak but the word of God says you can do all things through Christ that gives you strength hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord my my my you may be thinking you poor you even have no T but can I remind the devil and that SP of discouragement I don't think it is still here but let me say this the Bible says the world and all his fullness is the Lord he can decide to give you everything and anything you have need of praise the name of the Lord we not commoners we are Kings we are priests amen hallelujah we are Kings and we my father did this and this can I remind you you are a child of the this is not just we are sympathizing with our it is being realistic speaking the truth spiritually realistic which can calm down by the power of the Holy SP and come in the reality of the body and happen by reality Abraham could not have a son for years and years and even by reality it came to a time when even if God would do a miracle their bodies was not able to carry a child but God is God God Is God When God is ready to move he can do anything he's the creator of Heaven and Earth he came down abrah he made him a young man you saw our president makings Abraham could do with one hand said I feel the strength of and he came to sah Sarah became a young lady oh my God like my sister over here and strong and became pregnant who could do that the creator of Heaven and Earth I want to tell you brother nothing should discourage you because God is never let when God is provoked by prayer he fulfills every promise hallelujah amen he says he will give us the desire of our hearts a promise also the scripture says we are not of those that draw back let others draw back like Joshua as for me and my house I will serve the Lord I will serve the Lord hallelujah you ought to tell your neighbor neighbor I don't care about you but I know let me tell you I know about me I have resolved to serve the Lord all my life I will not be discouraged amen hallelujah he will give me the desire of my heart if I need a wife he will give me a wife if I need a husband he will give me a husband my husband my wife doesn't come from much it comes from God I was 19 years and I decided to have a wife brother how old yes you yourself my precious yes 19 17 at your age I was preaching moving around the [Music] world I was a little boy and you see your age now at two years I decided to be married the brother was like what it's the truth it's the promise of God is was it possible for me was it it wasn't it's not many years ago it wasn't possible it was as difficult as it is now who is 19 here you come here you come come but you you are big body you you see think that I was big like you I was small like this young man imagine this young man saying that he wants to get who will support [Music] him but I made up my mind to get married and I was dressing suits like yes but for him is even smart I had those big sies because I was being just giving them to me I did not own I didn't have money I was poor that's the truth so a brother like would come and give me a suit and I would wear it gladly because I wanted to be smart in church come I show you some of my pictures and I would wear a suit no the suit would wear me and I would go to church and I would be very happy praise God God bless you Hallelujah and I told my mother my mother have decided to marry she's here she called me by name when my mother calls [Music] me things are bad I will lay you down and beat you friends there is something I'm showing you it's not about the reality it's about the promise every the promise of God when believe sonter it cannot fail can fail it will be a compl he said he will give you the desire of your heart if you you want say I want to be a millionaire next year for example you brother you have a company you can say I'm no longer working for anyone I want to build my company next year and in two years I want to make my first million it is possible it is possible there is nothing impossible with God but the problem of Christians they don't believe the promise they in the 10 Witnesses because they are more and they look more experienced and they elders but if you are wise listen to The Still small voice of Joshua and they said we are more than able to take the land brother to take the land sister amen raise up at once let's go and take the L and I also say we more than able to buy our church land we are more than able to build our church if the Lord Tes before the coming of the lord we are more than able to build a very wonderful structure and many Souls will be saved in there for the glory of God it is a promise if we desire it he would give it if you think I'm Dreaming just wait and see [Music] just wait and see man I thought I was dreaming 5 years ago 10 years ago years ago s years ago they said this little boy is just he will give up he will give up very soon I remember I went to Zimbabwe 2011 very small boy and I stood before a Congregation of about 3,000 and uh I even now believe wonder how those people I was very little supposed to be despised but brother when you believe in the promise of God and believe in yourself what God has made you nothing can stand this man came said oh my little preacher God bless you if you keep doing this God will bless you and it was an encouragement but many times I would also get discouragement you would preach another preacher comes to you says did you know you said this when you're supposed to say this you continue studying the Bible you'll get there you would be discouraged but brother let us not focus on the discouraging let us focus on the promise God said we will have and we will have the L God said we will marry and we will marry God said we receive the holy and we receive the Holy Spirit God said we shall be rich shall be rich God said we shall receive the of our and it shall be how many can say Amen with one voice that on our feet hallelujah hallelujah whose report shall We Believe should believe the report hallelujah hallelujah oh my how many still have the speed

to give their life to Jesus we appreciate you for these souls and as we lead them to you Lord may it be a wonderful time that you shall receive them Lord and that there will begin a New Journey in New Life Grant it Lord in Jesus name amen what we there is a uh sister here and there's a little one Genesis where is sheis they want to give I'm told they want to give their life to Jesus I ask him to stand and we just lead them to the Lord Jesus it's a wonderful thing we should all be happy praise God give her the microphone let her tell us let her just confess with our own mouth yeah why she's here I'm called imate she comes from B but I've been walking around with him I want to be prayed for every job that I get I don't get any money from it I've seen I've gone through many places and I say let me come and I be prayed for because I'm always in trouble crying and think even the job I was working they calling me I don't know whether I will have it they were not allowing me to go to church but today I I asked them to give me permission to come to church so she met somebody on the way and she was like what was that brother Ivan yes so sister what's your name again sister imate Alinda Immaculate Alinda Immaculate okay what I want to tell you you are not here by acci God has brought you okays to confess all these problems you say you have it is only one thing that is Jesus Christ many people go to false prophets to break C go there they take that all those on Li is only one person who breaks spoke and said come and I will give you rest tired you have come in the right place we're not going to take to the P to the prophet of the might man of that one doesn't there's only one thing which can it is Jesus Christ the Bible says when you accept him repent of your sins when you repent your sins you are baptized in much water in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ then what Falls he will forgive you all the sins then next he will give you the Holy Spirit now that Holy Spirit it is the power that will break all those yolks the Witchcraft of the devil the power of the Holy Spirit breaks all those how many believe that you're going to you're going to confess salvation that is the first step second step to be baptized in much water and I know why she's crying the God she has met and friends I want her to I want us to pray together with her but as we lead that to the Lord this will be a beginning of our amen so repeat after me for confession is made salvation [Music] I just commit my sister here before you I pray oh God that the power of the Holy Ghost will lead her father you will guide her dear father Lord and you'll feel her from the crown of our head to the S of our feet father let the spirit of God continue to amen move all all over her father cool over her soul oh God bring her into your presence I pray oh Father in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ until she goes into the Waters of baptism father and that will be the beginning of a great work you will do in our life oh Father we have seen many of delivered we have seen many of saided a good work in their life may she be one of those Lord in the name of Jesus Christ let us give a clap of praise to the Lord amen [Music] this little sister when I came to pray for those that I was praying [Music] for you know usually I don't ask for people what they want me to pray for because God knows it and I'm not a Catholic priest either I'm just a preacher and they tell God and I pray for them but usually when I pray I notic God inspires me on what to pray for so as I was praying for her I felt a little different that there was something special while she came on the you know children just always come and pray for them sometimes they do it because others are doing it but when I came to pray for her I felt a bit different that there is a specific reason why she came so here is how I prayed I said Lord you know the reason why she has come may you lead her even in her Young Life to meet you I didn't know that she was giving her life to Jesus praise God so why are you here [Music] I I want to receive Jesus Christ as my savior amen amen how old are you dear seven seven seven is a supernatural [Music] age how old were you when you were baptized seven stand up come right here from the elab shba was baptized for the first for that whole week for the first one or two weeks we noticed myself and her mother that she was going through an experience whenever she would come in the church she would cry she would be easily moved by the things of God I don't think that it was in vain when this little give their life to Jesus we should not hinder [Music] them imag what little children has se do the world they understand so if they tell you they want to give their life to Jesus let them do it and if they want to be baptized let them do it as long as it's their decision the anchor will hold in their life praise God and Elizabeth how old were you when you baptized seven there something about seven seven is completion and Genesis is seven years there was the age of accountability seven with God because is the age of completion so Genesis Genesis repeat after me I and then say your name speak through the microphone I Genesis from today from today I accept Jesus Christ I accept Jesus Christ as my personal savior as my personal Savor I want to serve him I want to serve him all my life all my life so help me God so help me God let us pray together can you take the microphone from [Music] her Lord Jesus I'm coming to you oh God committing and dedicating this little one before you father as she at her age seven decided to accept you as our personal Savior and give her life to you oh God I pray oh Father Lord you will receive her my father Lord as even she grows and has a great life ahead of her that you keep her away from all these demons and spirits of love this year you will all God build a wall of fire around about her father and keep her away from all the FI TR of the world that you will raise her as an army of the Lord and even as she goes into the Waters of baptism father you'll fill her with the power of the Holy Spirit Lord Jesus that she will be raised as a goodly child that will serve the Lord the rest of our life father we commit her to you now as you receive her in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen we'll meet you up the service Hallelujah we shall meet them after the service and continue to instruct them and guide them so God bless you thank you for your [Music] patience we are going to now go into the married couples service in about 1 hour we would lay 11 minutes because it's already 2:11 so at 3:11 we shall be here so we just go maybe find something to grab and eat quickly and then come back we are supposed to
