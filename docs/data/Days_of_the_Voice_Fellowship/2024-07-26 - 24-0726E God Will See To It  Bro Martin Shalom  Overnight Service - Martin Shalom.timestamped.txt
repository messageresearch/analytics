[22:19] presence of the
[22:20] Lord thank you for coming our pastor you
[22:23] most
[22:24] welcome amen
[22:29] and it came to pass after these things
[22:31] that God did tempt Abraham and said unto
[22:34] him Abraham and he
[22:37] said behold here I am and he said take
[22:41] now thy son thy only son Isaac whom thou
[22:44] lovest and get thee into the land of
[22:47] Moriah and of and offer him there for a
[22:53] burand offering upon one of the mountain
[22:56] which I will tell thee of of and Abraham
[22:59] rose up early in the morning and S his
[23:03] ass and took two of his young men with
[23:06] him and Isaac his son and clave the wood
[23:11] for the burnt offering and Rose up and
[23:13] went up the place of God uh the place of
[23:17] which God had told him then on the third
[23:21] day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw
[23:24] the place a far off and Abram said unto
[23:27] his unto his young man abide here with
[23:31] us and and I and the Lord will go under
[23:37] and worship and come again to you and
[23:40] Abraham took the word of the burnt
[23:42] offering and laid it upon Isaac's son
[23:45] and took the fire in his
[23:48] hand and a knife and they went both of
[23:52] them together and Isaac spoke unto
[23:54] Abraham his father and said my father
[23:57] and said he here I am my son and he said
[24:00] behold the fire behold the fire and the
[24:05] wood but where is the Lamb for the for
[24:07] burnt offering and Abram said my son God
[24:11] will provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[24:14] offering so they went both of them
[24:17] together and they came to the place
[24:19] which God had told him of and Abraham
[24:22] built an altar there and laid the wood
[24:25] in order and bound Isaac his son and
[24:28] laid him on the altar upon the wood and
[24:31] Abraham stretched forth his hand and
[24:33] took the knife to slay his son and the
[24:36] angel of the Lord called him out of
[24:39] heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he
[24:43] said here I am and said lay not thine
[24:47] hand upon the Lord neither do thou
[24:52] anything unto him for now I know that
[24:55] thou fearest God seeing thou Hast not
[24:58] withheld thy son thine only son from
[25:03] me may the Lord add the blessing the
[25:06] reading of his
[25:08] word
[25:13] amen praise be to
[25:17] God yeah I just have something small
[25:21] that I want us to share
[25:23] tonight and I will call it
[25:27] uh the prophet preached the message
[25:29] Jehovah
[25:33] gy and uh I just want to call
[25:37] it it's the same thing but I want to
[25:39] call it
[25:40] God will see to it amen blessed be the
[25:45] name of the
[25:48] Lord praise be to
[25:51] God yeah that's the God we are serving
[25:54] praise the Lord is Jehovah JRA
[25:58] is God who
[26:00] provide he has always been our
[26:03] provider he will provide until the
[26:06] Rapture amen even the Rapture is his
[26:10] provision blessed be the name of the
[26:13] Lord and here where we have read in
[26:16] Genesis chapter 22 from vers
[26:19] 1 all Bible readers we have read this uh
[26:24] multiple times preachers have preached
[26:27] about it and all of us I believe we know
[26:31] this how when God called
[26:34] Abraham said it came to pass after these
[26:37] things that God tempt
[26:40] Abraham God gave Abraham a
[26:42] promise and that was of Isaac amen and
[26:47] when Isaac was
[26:48] born
[26:50] God tried Abraham
[26:54] amen by asking Abraham to offer his only
[26:58] son blessed be the name of the
[27:02] Lord and you know Abraham was uh Sarah
[27:05] was a baren
[27:08] woman and was she was of age and Abraham
[27:11] was of
[27:12] age but Abraham the Bible says that he
[27:16] did not stagger at the promise of God
[27:20] but he believed God Amen every single
[27:23] day he was thanking God for the promise
[27:27] blessed be the name of the Lord he had
[27:29] not seen the
[27:31] promise but he believed that God who
[27:34] promised it he will bring it to pass
[27:37] blessed be the name of the Lord and when
[27:39] we see the Heroes of Faith Abraham is
[27:43] mentioned there amen blessed be the name
[27:46] of the Lord and I will start by quoting
[27:50] this message God's providing healing for
[27:52] this
[27:53] generation the prophet say that God can
[27:56] do all things he is Jehovah CH amen he's
[28:02] God who can do all things amen that's
[28:06] why the bible say that to them to those
[28:09] who believe all things are
[28:12] possible and what makes it possible is
[28:15] when Christ is there when God is there
[28:18] all things are possible when God comes
[28:21] in our mids tonight all things are
[28:25] possible what makes it possible is the
[28:27] presence of of God in our midest amen
[28:31] when God is in a family all things are
[28:33] possible when God is in business all
[28:36] things are possible when God is in our
[28:39] plans all things are possible amen that
[28:43] is what maketh difference and that's why
[28:47] it's up to us to allow God to be in our
[28:50] lives amen it's upon us to allow God to
[28:54] be in our midst because when God is
[28:57] there he makes all things possible
[29:00] blessed be the name of the Lord that's
[29:03] why the prophet say that message when
[29:05] Jesus come and call that when Jesus goes
[29:09] the trouble is on the way because when
[29:12] he leaves things will be hard amen
[29:15] because he is not there blessed be the
[29:18] name of the Lord but I'm talking tonight
[29:20] about
[29:22] God who will provide amen blessed be the
[29:27] name of the Lord that God that's the God
[29:30] we are serving praise the Lord and here
[29:34] Abraham and Abraham rose up early in the
[29:39] morning and he said take now thy son the
[29:43] only
[29:47] son whom thou lovest blessed be the name
[29:51] of the
[29:52] Lord indeed Abraham loved Isaac
[29:58] and get thee in the land of
[30:01] Moriah
[30:03] out offer him there for bur offering
[30:07] praise be to God you know in the whole
[30:10] Bible there's nowhere where God where
[30:13] they have ever given a human being as a
[30:16] BN offering praise be to
[30:19] God but God had a way he was trying
[30:22] Abraham to see what he will
[30:26] do praise be to God so he is Jehovah
[30:29] jirra the very God who gave Abraham
[30:32] Isaac that same God had a plan B for for
[30:38] Abraham the same God who called Israel
[30:41] out of
[30:42] Egypt he only told them about the
[30:45] promised land he never talked about the
[30:48] mountain about the FR tribe or the
[30:51] strange tribe amen all the Hostile tribe
[30:54] but he told them he's taking them to the
[30:57] promised land land that same God who
[31:00] called us he only told us about the
[31:02] Rapture the promise amen the Holy Ghost
[31:08] amen so this other thing God will take
[31:11] care
[31:12] of that's why when God told Abraham to
[31:15] offer his
[31:16] son Abraham never even knew that God had
[31:20] Plan B but Abraham had faith in God
[31:25] because the Bible says that whosoever
[31:27] comes to God must believe that he is you
[31:30] have to first believe that God is God
[31:34] that God is not man when God promise he
[31:39] will make it to come to
[31:41] pass amen when he say that he will
[31:44] supply our needs according to his riches
[31:48] in glory he means that indeed God is our
[31:54] source of
[31:55] Supply when he say that he will heal
[31:58] your body he means that when he says we
[32:01] give you salvation that's what God means
[32:04] it amen it's up to you to believe what
[32:07] God says blessed be the name of the Lord
[32:11] when he tells us that he will see us
[32:13] through it's up to you to believe amen
[32:17] that God will see us
[32:19] through blessed be the name of the Lord
[32:23] so when he told Abraham to go off for
[32:25] his son he knew that Abraham loved his
[32:27] son
[32:28] God knows that you love your bed so much
[32:31] that's why it tells to come in the
[32:33] overnight and thanks be to God that you
[32:35] have obeyed and you have come amen
[32:39] praise be to
[32:41] God
[32:45] so because you have taken the first
[32:49] step blessed be the name of the Lord
[32:52] sometime we come and the devil want try
[32:55] to make us do
[32:58] but brother
[33:00] sister you are here because God has
[33:04] called you to
[33:13] come overnight we have come for the
[33:18] overnight praise be to God because every
[33:22] time God gathers us he has something for
[33:26] us each time time we come to meet
[33:30] God every time the president calls for a
[33:33] meeting I'm telling you there will be
[33:35] exchange of
[33:40] envelopes
[33:53] amen so this is
[33:56] our pra be to God and each time we come
[34:00] here God has something for us amen and
[34:05] we should not miss
[34:07] that every time we come he want to heal
[34:10] us he want to revive us amen he want to
[34:14] restore us he want to strengthen us he
[34:18] want to renew us amen praise be to God
[34:22] because the coming of the Lord is near
[34:24] the way is getting narrow every day amen
[34:27] we approaching the peak of the
[34:30] pyramid praise be to God the way is
[34:33] getting narrow every single
[34:36] minute so we need more of him we need
[34:40] more of his anointing in fact we need
[34:44] God has to Triple his anointing blessed
[34:47] be the name of the Lord
[34:52] amen and he came to pass
[34:54] this it says here that no matter what
[34:57] the doctor says no matter what the
[35:00] people say he is Jehovah G the Lord will
[35:03] provide in an instant time the sacrifice
[35:08] is
[35:10] needed blessed be the name of the Lord
[35:13] that is in the message faith of
[35:16] Abraham the Lord will provide in that
[35:19] instant time
[35:34] because Lazarus was there for 4 days
[35:38] that it was too
[35:39] late but it was not too late it was the
[35:44] right right time amen and Jesus Christ
[35:49] is the same yesterday today and forever
[35:53] he's still working the same way praise
[35:55] be to God
[35:57] most time we think it is too late for
[36:00] him amen say but Pastor now it is too
[36:04] late but my brother my
[36:07] sister God comes on
[36:10] time blessed be the name of the Lord
[36:14] Abraham moved for good number of days
[36:17] amen he was going to sacrifice his
[36:21] son and God was seeing all these things
[36:25] amen God already prepar prepared a
[36:28] lamb to be sacrificed blessed be the
[36:32] name of the Lord so the God I'm talking
[36:35] about tonight is that God will see
[36:41] it whatever you've been praying for
[36:44] whatever you're asking from God Amen
[36:47] just have faith and be sure that God is
[36:51] going to make it come to
[36:54] pass blessed be the name of the Lord
[36:57] because when God spoke to Abraham he had
[37:00] already a solution for
[37:03] himam say that God want to see how he
[37:08] react God liked trying his children amen
[37:12] he made them to pass through the
[37:14] Wilderness because he wanted to see what
[37:16] was in their
[37:18] heart not in a bad
[37:22] way praise be to God
[37:36] that's why the bible say that all things
[37:38] work together for
[37:41] good he is still Jehovah
[37:44] Gyra he still our provider that God
[37:48] still
[37:49] provide amen he still
[37:53] heals we are living in the time where
[37:56] healing
[37:57] you will even hardly hear people testify
[38:01] about the healing amen but doesn't mean
[38:05] that healing is not there healing is
[38:07] there amen it's in our
[38:11] midst blessed be the name of the Lord
[38:14] sometime we just don't want to
[38:20] testify few days
[38:23] ago uh my daughter got uh she was
[38:27] attacked by chicken
[38:29] pox and I was so close to her being that
[38:33] the mother has a little baby so I had to
[38:37] take the risk
[38:38] amen and just two I think two days down
[38:41] the road I realized I had the same thing
[38:46] blessed be the name of the
[38:48] Lord and those who have ever suffered
[38:50] from it it's not something by the
[38:54] simple but just
[38:56] imagine I'm much person like
[39:00] me it looks so
[39:03] awkward so
[39:05] funny
[39:07] amen so I asked myself God
[39:11] really I started itching
[39:15] itching and we're busy here
[39:18] working but thanks be to God Amen I
[39:23] never even pray that God I resist this
[39:25] demon what no
[39:28] I just said let me work for God God will
[39:31] work for me blessed be the name of the
[39:34] Lord I want to tell you that even the
[39:37] drugs I bought I think I only took three
[39:42] capsules 3 days down the road I realized
[39:45] the thing was not
[39:49] there blessed be the name of the
[39:52] Lord amen so Jesus is still a Healer
[40:00] amen so my labor was not in
[40:04] vain I surrendered my life regardless of
[40:09] the fatigue the pain in the body and the
[40:13] what God healed me
[40:18] instantly blessed be the name of the
[40:21] Lord and that same Spirit still buzzing
[40:24] at home there I realize my two my other
[40:26] two kids also
[40:28] they are showing the sign but the same
[40:31] Jesus will heal
[40:34] them blessed be the name of the Lord
[40:37] just when he tried me he realized that
[40:39] he was he was he tampered with the wrong
[40:43] button
[40:45] Jesus gave him a good
[40:47] slap blessed be the name of the Lord so
[40:51] that same
[40:52] Jesus the Same God you know sometime the
[40:56] B say the same
[40:57] the same God who heals
[40:59] flu is the the same power that heals flu
[41:03] is the same power that heals cancer so
[41:06] God has no weaker point and stronger
[41:08] Point amen so that same same
[41:12] power is the still the same power that
[41:15] can raise the
[41:17] dead so that God will bring it to pass
[41:21] amen if you have a need tonight I'm here
[41:24] to tell you that Jesus will bring that
[41:27] to pass if you can only believe amen so
[41:32] our God is Jehovah Gyra Our God will
[41:35] bring it to pass
[41:38] amen he will answer all your prayers
[41:42] tonight he will set you free he will
[41:46] meet your needs he will restore you amen
[41:50] he will revive you blessed be the name
[41:53] of the Lord
[41:56] amen it came to pass these things that
[41:59] God did tempt Abraham and said un him
[42:01] Abraham he said behold here I am and say
[42:06] take now thy son and thy only son Isaac
[42:10] whom thou lovest and get thee in the
[42:13] land of morai and offer him for a burnt
[42:16] offering upon one of this mountain which
[42:20] I will tell
[42:23] thee not only G but even I will tell you
[42:26] where
[42:28] to
[42:29] offer the boy blessed be the name of the
[42:32] Lord he was not supposed to offer him
[42:40] anywhere but this man was following the
[42:43] leadership of God when God is trying us
[42:47] his trial always comes with the
[42:50] leadership blessed be the name of the
[42:53] Lord we cannot say that we are tried
[42:56] time after
[43:01] time there there even no voice of
[43:06] God because the bible say that God is
[43:09] not the author of confusion
[43:11] amen and this man rose up very early in
[43:13] the morning and went with a boy and his
[43:17] servant blessed be the name of the Lord
[43:20] for the Bible tells us in Isaiah 1: 19
[43:23] that if you be willing and obedient you
[43:26] shall eat the good of the
[43:29] land this comes with willingness and
[43:33] obedience Abraham first of all he was
[43:36] willing to offer his son
[43:40] amen and another thing he had to obey
[43:44] the voice of
[43:46] God and that's why the scripture say
[43:48] that if we be willing and
[43:52] obedient amen we shall eat the good of
[43:57] the
[43:59] land if we be willing if we be willing
[44:03] and be obedient to the word of God we
[44:06] shall eat the fruit of the land we shall
[44:12] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost if
[44:15] we be willing and obedient to the word
[44:18] amen there is a
[44:21] promise as long as there is willingness
[44:24] and
[44:25] obedience blessed be the name of the
[44:28] Lord and God want us to be
[44:30] willing God want us to be obedient to
[44:33] the word to follow his
[44:37] voice to listen to his voice Amen to
[44:40] follow the word to walk according to his
[44:43] word blessed be the name of the Lord
[44:46] there is a promise amen he has given us
[44:50] the promise if we be willing and
[44:53] obedient we shall eat the fruit of the
[44:57] the
[44:59] Land There is
[45:01] healing there is
[45:04] Deliverance there is
[45:06] Victory there is
[45:08] Revival there is Vision amen all those
[45:12] are the fruits of
[45:14] obedience as long as you are willing to
[45:17] obey praise be to God we shall enjoy all
[45:22] those
[45:22] things the Bible tells us should not
[45:25] quench the spirit of God
[45:28] we should never quench the Revival in
[45:30] our midst amen when we see the glimpse
[45:33] of Revival in our midst in fact we
[45:37] should even seek God more say God send
[45:41] us more out of
[45:42] this
[45:44] amen we should never allow to have cold
[45:48] Services cold worship form worship amen
[45:53] where your hands are heavy as if they're
[45:55] not yours
[46:06] we should never allow
[46:10] that amen because when the presence of
[46:14] God comes down he change even the setup
[46:17] of
[46:19] worship the worship has become Swift in
[46:23] worship amen
[46:28] people would jump like
[46:35] like so we should reach that point where
[46:38] it's not us doing it but it is God in us
[46:43] doing it blessed be the name of the Lord
[46:46] but bam said that when a man catches the
[46:48] vision of the invisible God in the
[46:51] message looking at
[46:53] Unseen and know that he is all always
[46:58] present there is something that
[47:00] stabilizes that man is
[47:04] thinking it stabilizes his
[47:07] actions amen knowing that God is present
[47:11] in our
[47:14] midst knowing that God is in our midst
[47:18] he said there is
[47:20] something that
[47:24] stabilizes that man is thinking
[47:29] the reason that's why we don't have
[47:30] stabilized mind is because we are not
[47:33] sure that God is in our
[47:36] midst but says the prophet that when God
[47:39] is in our midst it stabilizes not only
[47:42] your thinking even your
[47:44] action you will not just worship anyhow
[47:49] loudly you just sing
[47:52] anyhow praise be to God
[47:58] let me walk bless Lord in the way thou
[48:03] Hast gone leading straight to
[48:11] the you're not sure whether you're in
[48:13] that
[48:15] way and that way is the way of the word
[48:20] it is the way of the
[48:23] Cross so when you are singing it amen
[48:26] let me walk blessed because you know
[48:29] what we talking
[48:31] about so that's why I see that when we
[48:34] are certain when man catches the vision
[48:38] of the invisible God that that invisible
[48:42] God is Incarnate in you that stabilizes
[48:46] your
[48:47] mind amen it stabilizes even your heart
[48:51] because you know that you are the incet
[48:54] of the invisible God
[48:57] blessed be the name of the
[48:59] Lord and that makes sure that he's
[49:02] always present with
[49:11] you he always works with
[49:15] us blessed be the name of the Lord and
[49:18] it says simpol ases the action and in
[49:21] the time of distress and
[49:24] trouble it is still making him look
[49:27] upward above things that are happening
[49:30] around
[49:32] him praise be to
[49:36] God do you think Abraham was scared of
[49:39] what was happening around
[49:41] him this man had caught the
[49:45] vision he saw the age at which God gave
[49:49] him that
[49:50] boy and the same God has asked for the
[49:55] boy and I believe here that Abraham was
[49:59] looking upward above the things that was
[50:02] happening around him because he is
[50:05] looking at his he is looking at the
[50:09] Unseen blessed be the name of the
[50:12] Lord amen so may God help us catch that
[50:19] Vision may God stabilizes our
[50:24] mind may God symbolizes our faith
[50:32] amen but what I'm saying that a
[50:34] Christian is not tossed
[50:37] around from Pillar To
[50:40] Post when we accept Jesus Christ and he
[50:44] comes and dwell in us that stabilizes us
[50:49] amen oh what blessings for us to be
[50:52] stabilized in Christ there is stability
[50:55] in Christ Jesus amen when we in
[50:59] denomination we were tossed by Winds of
[51:02] every
[51:03] Doctrine but when Jesus revealed himself
[51:07] to us and we accepted him he revealed
[51:11] this message to us this all stabilizes
[51:15] us blessed be the name of the
[51:18] Lord psalms 27 20 ver 7 say that some
[51:22] trust in Chariot and some in horses
[51:27] but we will remember the name of our
[51:36] Lord we will remember the name of our
[51:39] Lord because the name of the Lord is
[51:42] strong and mighty
[51:44] tower that's where
[51:47] righteous are secured
[51:50] amen our security is in the Lord
[51:57] that's why we says that Jesus at a
[51:59] mention of your names flowers grow that
[52:04] days are Blossom
[52:08] again our stability is in the
[52:11] Lord his name is our Strong
[52:15] Tower it's our security it's our defense
[52:20] it's our shelter amen Jesus is a rock in
[52:24] a we land
[52:26] he's a shelter in time of the
[52:30] storm
[52:32] amen not only the name but when Jesus in
[52:36] is in our soul our Soul Is Anchored In
[52:40] The
[52:44] Lord some in charot
[53:17] because from state
[53:19] house in the name of the president
[53:22] blessed be the name of the
[53:24] Lord how about Christians
[53:29] if we have
[53:31] Jesus everything will have to give
[53:35] away because he is our anchor he's
[53:46] our and that's why we speak with
[53:50] authority not only to the Devil by the
[53:55] way but both the devil and even to our
[53:58] fellow
[54:01] men blessed be the name of the
[54:06] Lord

[58:43] god without desperation we cannot get
[58:46] anything from

[59:06] was looking for a
[59:08] child praise be to God Sarah was

[59:20] they're seeing things when things are
[59:21] not moving right you find when they

[59:40] movement in the
[59:42] womb the mother will become
[59:46] concern blessed be the name of the Lord

[1:00:20] Lord Believers let us be
[1:00:24] desperate May God give us desperation in
[1:00:27] our
[1:00:29] heart it is my prayer that God should
[1:00:32] never leave us to rest until each and
[1:00:35] every member is desperate for
[1:00:39] him
[1:00:43] amen when someone is
[1:00:46] convicted and knows that he's
[1:00:49] condemned and is waiting for the day of
[1:00:53] execution blessed be the name of the
[1:01:00] Lord he will not sleep
[1:01:31] Believers have forgotten their
[1:01:34] responsibility we don't know what we
[1:01:35] supposed to
[1:01:37] do some are suffering from
[1:01:41] Amnesia spiritual
[1:01:54] Amia you are not fine
[1:02:27] you are not
[1:02:28] okay
[1:02:30] amen the Believers of long
[1:02:33] ago they were more serious than us who
[1:02:36] are living in the end
[1:02:41] time Daniel said by the number of books
[1:02:45] when he saw that the 70 years was
[1:02:49] expiring what did he see he went to see
[1:02:52] God In Prayer fasting supplication
[1:02:55] confessing repenting blessed be the name
[1:02:59] of the Lord because he knew that the
[1:03:01] time for going back was at
[1:03:05] hand
[1:03:07] amen 50 years ago God sending the
[1:03:12] prophet with a message of his coming as
[1:03:16] John the Baptist was said for him your
[1:03:19] message Believers are
[1:03:23] relaxing we are so busy
[1:03:31] say
[1:03:41] mothers blessed be the name of the
[1:03:45] Lord but God is still
[1:03:48] calling
[1:03:50] Amen Let Us tithe our time to God
[1:03:57] young people there's what we call prayer
[1:04:08] walk that time in
[1:04:10] prayer
[1:04:13] amen it is
[1:04:20] possible the Bible say the kingdom of
[1:04:22] God suffer violence and violent they
[1:04:25] take take it by
[1:04:31] force you have to press yourself

[1:05:07] people because the criteria is
[1:05:10] one
[1:05:12] amen through the same
[1:05:16] door there's no way the other person
[1:05:19] will get something through prayer and
[1:05:21] for you will
[1:05:22] bypass no way there is no option in
[1:05:29] this if New Birth is at the altar you
[1:05:31] must be at the
[1:05:33] altar either here or in the bush at your
[1:05:42] home praise be to
[1:05:45] God so there's no
[1:05:49] option There's No
[1:05:54] Escape there's nothing you can swap with
[1:05:58] fasting this is not like Muslims where
[1:06:01] you I can fast for brother
[1:06:03] Dixon no sir you fast for
[1:06:10] yourself take your burden to the Lord

[1:07:02] in the message expectation as I'm
[1:07:04] finishing the prophet says that
[1:07:07] uh uh he fully
[1:07:10] obeyed and when he came to full
[1:07:13] obedience then God brought the
[1:07:17] blessings Abraham had to obey each and
[1:07:20] every instruction which God gave
[1:07:23] him he reached somewh where he told his
[1:07:27] servants stop here I am the Lord we are
[1:07:31] going up to worship and then after we
[1:07:34] shall come back not I will come back
[1:07:38] because he already knew the
[1:07:40] secret blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:07:43] but he believed that God will provide
[1:07:48] and would come back with his son and
[1:07:51] here the prophet tells us that he fully
[1:07:53] obeyed when when he came to full when he
[1:07:57] come to full obedience then God brought
[1:08:00] the
[1:08:03] blessings when he reached there tied the
[1:08:06] boy's hand got the
[1:08:08] knife he was he obeyed God
[1:08:12] fully then the angel of the Lord called
[1:08:16] him and showed him the
[1:08:19] sacrifice blessed be the name of the
[1:08:21] Lord so unless we obey fully
[1:08:26] there's no way amen the only way to go
[1:08:30] is obeying God
[1:08:33] fully and when we reach there then God
[1:08:37] will bring his blessings in our
[1:08:41] midst so we have a task to obey God to
[1:08:46] walk in full
[1:08:49] obedience God will give us that Grace
[1:08:53] amen God knows knows our
[1:08:56] insufficiency he knows that we are weak
[1:08:59] he knows that we are not able amen but
[1:09:02] in our weakness he called us regardless
[1:09:05] of our
[1:09:07] wickedness amen and we are working
[1:09:10] together with him is working his
[1:09:13] righteousness in
[1:09:15] us and God is very sure that by the end
[1:09:19] of the day we are going to be we are
