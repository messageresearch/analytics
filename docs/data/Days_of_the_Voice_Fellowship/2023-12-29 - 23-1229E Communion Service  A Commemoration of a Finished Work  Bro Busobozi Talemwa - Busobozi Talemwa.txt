inspire me anoint me and may something be said that you will bless someone tonight in Jesus name [Music] amen I invite you to your Bibles please if you can open your Bible with me praise God am we're going to the Book of Matthew chapter 26 vers 26 I greet you all in the precious name of Jesus Christ I'm happy to see you again thank you for your prayers those who prayed God answered your prayers we we had a good trip in kosi Ken we had good Services there we still wearing the body are trusting that God will give us strength Ed this church about 13 of us so quite a lot of people went in amen I know Sister Stella I'm happy to see you I know you were also in the Convention in S I don't know whether sister Ruth is back she had also traveled yes she came back sister Ruth so uh we happy that we are here tonight and this day today we are going to have our first communion and I'm happy to see the genuine Believers tonight amen uh we are sorry to hear that uh sister um Esther is not able to be with us this evening because is she here sister Esther she's under the way coming oh that must be a big sacrifice uh because she called me when her father was being rushed to the hospital in an ambulance remember them in prayer brotheri uh his father her father is a translator of this message so we trust that God will give him Grace so we are reading from vers 26 and as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take itat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but I say unto you I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom amen you be seated may God [Music] bless [Music] [Music] [Music] for now I also desire to read in the Book of Revelation chapter 5 5 1 to verse S and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne if you have your lug Bible you can really read and follow us there and uh uh saw him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof and no man in heaven knowing Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look their own and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look their own and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and lose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld an law in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth verse 7 and he came and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne praise the name of the Lord and so this evening I want to speak to you on a commemoration of a finished work a commemoration a commemoration of a finished work how do you say that a commemoration of a finished work amen praise the name of the Lord amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen tell someone God bless you amen praise the name of the Lord amen sister all right a commemoration of a finished work so we see there is something just little I want to share with you perhaps in about um 50 minutes and then we shall go to the the communion amen and uh to those of you who missed the communion on the teaching on communion you missed and unfortunately I'm going I'm not going to go back to that again but perhaps you if you pray the Lord can lead me to say something that will benefit the cup he took the cup he gave thanks and he gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remion of sins now the reason why I've read in the Book of Revelation CH 5 is because we see here one that is Seated on the throne and it says in his right hand was a book and this book was sealed with Seven Seals andam says that that was the book of redemption and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals there no man in heaven was worthy no man in earth was worthy just say what I said no man in heaven was worthy no man on Earth was worthy neither under the Earth now not only being worthy but there was also no one worthy to look upon the book and John who we know the prophet of God says that he is a type of the Bride so John is your type John types you and me and so John when he saw that there was no one worthy he began weeping if you look at verse five if can put that for us up [Music] there and one of the elders said unto me weep not one of the elders said unto me Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and to lose the seals there now let us lift this out of the Bible let us bring it down here today 2023 no one was worthy to save you out of your sin but only he the lion the lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David amen is worthy and and he says I beheld and and and when John looked in in the midst of the throne and in the middle of the four beasts and in the middle of the elders there stood a lamb and this lamb was as it says as it had been slain so this lamb was slain when John saw it are you following me this this evening the lamb was already slain and when was it slain remember John was seeing this in a way of a vision and as much as he knows that no one was worthy but he he was told that the lion of the tribe of Judah is and when he turned to see he saw what a lamb I'll read it for you later later on here the lamb the lion became the lamb who is worthy only God is worthy there was no there was no priest there was no Prophet there was no holy man that was worthy when Adam and Eve sinned Adam could not redeem the Fallen the generations after him could not no one could redeem the Fallen rest and I'll tell you why there was no one because it had to take death death of the Redeemer because the penalty of sin was death that's the ultimate price of sin and from ad to all the generations after him they had all Fallen to sin we were all Sinners by and so and so what would then God do because if we are all sinners there needed to be one to save the Sinners but the one that was to save had to have ability to save you know the scripture which says for God who was rich in Mercy if you are going to buy someone from from his C captivity you have to have riches you have to have ability in order to buy the person who is imprisoned and God and God had to have riches God had to have wealth God had to have ability in order to buy off a sinner from his sin and there was no one worthy to do only God was worthy you know what he did he God himself decided to die but I ask you a question how could God die because the Bible says God is a spirit and a spirit die Spirit cannot die so what did God do God put on flesh and he came down Among Us in order to pay the ultimate price the ultimate price of sin but you see before he could die he became the lamb before he could die he had to come from spiritual form to human form he had to wear a body like of yours and so that he can be able to bleed and die and people did not understand who he was because they did not understand the mystery of godliness what is the mystery of godliness that God himself the creator of Heaven and Earth could humble himself into a form of humility Simplicity God came down to [Music] Simplicity and in that way of Simplicity he reveal himself to the human [Music] race and it's a great mystery friends we see Jesus being baptized someone asked me a question why was Jesus being baptized did he have sin no Jesus did not have sin but before a lamb could be sacrificed that lamb had to be washed first and so Jesus was a lamb of God Away The Sins of the world and so that's why he came down and he was baptized he was being washed and being prepared for the sacrifice and I'm so glad that today we can say Jesus is Worthy and in the message the revelation of Jesus Christ would you like an old an Old Testament type let us go back to Garden of aen when the first news came to the to to to Glory that the son Adam had been lost did God send an angel I ask a question did God send an angel did God send a son did he send another one like unto us did God send a son did God send someone like unto us some people are keeping quiet because you have to understand the mystery of God and the prophet says no he came himself to redeem that lost son Hallelujah God did not entrust his Plan of Salvation to another he trusted only himself God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and redeemed us unto himself we are saved by the blood of God no man can save us Buddha could not save us mhamad could not save us CH cannot save us no human being can save us Moses could not save us abah could not sa are you hearing me could not serve us even Adam himself could not serve us even Bram could not save us no man could save us God himself he came down to save the human race he trusted only himself Hallelujah am I'm so glad God could not trust me trust you but he trusted himself he said I'm going to save you by myself hallelujah amen God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and redeemed us unto himself we are saved by the blood of God we are not saved by a blood of an Angel we are not saved by a blood of Gabriel or the blood of Michael the angel now we are saved amen by the blood of God himself we not set by even Mary there are many men and women God has used in history prophets and you know prophetes anointed men and women you know there are angels that God has used but when it comes to Redemption area can only be handled by God himself he cannot trust anybody else because he knows no one else has ability to but God himself I tell you brother sister there is no way any of those whose names were on the Book of Life can remain unsaved because God swear by himself I am going to serve them to redeem them and when he open the book and he lose the SE I want to tell you what happened that's why he sends a prophet let me tell you the work of a prophet the work of a prophet in this work of redemption is simply to call out the names of those who are on the register hallelujah amen who wrote those names God wrote those names who open and revealed things God did that God did that what's the work of a minister when I come to you to preach to you right now I'm only I'm only telling you what is here I am not saving You by preaching to you telling you you are saved by what is written down here and when I preach inspiration comes upon me and it comes and Strikes you and like that's the truth what happens when that happens it means you have had your name being called and then he begin saying amen I believe that that is my name being called and that's why we are here friends because our name was no the devil cannot unall us hallelujah because I'm called amen by Jehovah God the devil cannot remove me my name is in the book tell your neighbor my name is in the book Hallelujah our names were put there before we were born even whatever you did in your life knew but still your name was there because he knows when he calls you you will respond to amen hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord amen he became the lamb in order to shed his blood and enter into the veil with it consider this since it is the blood of God it is the it is perfect blood and if the perfect blood is losing us from power and if the perfect blood is losing us from the power and bondage and defilement of listen listen carefully if it is the perfect blood it is losing let me put it is losing me from the power and the bondage and defilement of the devil wanted to defile you but because this Blood saved you and saved me is so perfect that blood is so powerful to lose you from all bondage from all powers from every defilement God for the blood am then the losing is perfect and complete you remember when Jesus Christ spoke at the Tom of Lazarus what did he say when Lazarus when he called him out he says Lazarus come out then Lazarus came and Lazarus was bound but Jesus did not stop there he said lose him lose him and let him go now he has called us and we have come here under the word in the church where we hear the word being preached do you know what the word is doing to us the word of God is losing us from every Power from every Hallelujah from every defilement it is perfect blood and if the the perfect blood is losing us from the power and bondage it losing is perfect and complete tell your neighbor I am loed I am Lo if you you are still bound still tell your neighbor I am lose I am lose if you say it it will happen to you I am loose I am not bound I am lose hallelujah amen there is now there no condemnation who shall anything to the charge of God is elect it is God that justifies God that declares you and me righteous who is he that condemns it is Christ that died there it is his death gave us the blood the blood has losed us there is now no condemnation can there be there is nothing to be condemned for oh my God I should be excited because of that you should be excited because of that there is nothing to be condemned about because the blood has losed us from we are free we are Guiltless hallelujah amen we are free we are Guiltless brother before we come to the communion table I want to tell you this if you repented of what you did and you've crossed that bridge and you bur your Bridge behind you it doesn't matter what you did across the bridge whatever is there behind God can no longer remember you are free you are Guiltless it is you that remembers but God does not remember your sins are far removed from you if I don't preach this I'll be preaching a lie but if I'm preaching the blood and the power of the blood I am preaching the truth to you hallelujah amen don't listen to man he says listen to the word man will say no you bound no you are sinful no you are like this but he says don't listen to don't listen to man listen to the word You Are losed by the blood now don't get tied down again by traditions and Creeds and organizations don't be laid by astray by listening to those that deny the power of the word and deny that Jesus saves they deny that Jesus heals they deny that he fills with the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen hallelujah amen are you hearing me church I'm so excited because of this I believe Jesus saves I believe Jesus heals I believe he the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen if somebody says know you are a liar I know you tell them the one you used to know is dead the things I used to do I do them no more I am a new creation in Christ oh H Allelujah amen praise the name of the Lord amen you are God is free man losed by his own blood if you still hold your faith to Creeds and denominations it is certain by the evidence that you have lost your faith in the world praise God Amen all denominations they tell us if you do this and that you have received salvation but it's only this message that will tell us if you receive the word of God then you have received salvation if you received the power of the Holy Ghost then you receive salvation praise God and salvation has been given once and for all to all those that would believe and accept it and in the message the communion he says it's not given for the purpose that many people think it is communion is not given for the purpose that many people think it is it's taugh by a certain denin of church that communion is called the last rights the last rights things that when someone is going to die what they do [Music] last that it pertains to Salvation communion does not pertain to Salvation can I hear an Amen on that communion does not give you salvation whether you take it in your death or what it does not have nothing to do with your salvation it is a commemoration Jesus said in the gospel he said this do in remembrance of me not in leaning or pointings to Salvation but it is in commemoration of a finished work that has already been done in You by the holy spirit amen amen the work has already been done in you so whenever we take communion it's not like saying oh we are now going to be saved no it does not Ser us but we do it in commemoration of a finished work that has been done in Me In You by the Holy Spirit it is a commemoration now it's just like water baptism what baptism to is not does not save you you see I want you to know friends there nothing that we do that saves us everything that we do points to the fact that we are saved do you say amen amen if you refuse water baptism it shows you are not saved how do know that you are saved if you receive the word the whole word of God then it means you are saved because you have faith without faith it is impossible to see God right am so it is impossible to please God you must have faith in order to be saved and we are saved by Grace it is the gift of God through faith by grace through faith are you understand what I'm saying now that faith is blessed in your soul by the Holy Spirit if you don't have the Holy Spirit you don't have faith the faith of the son of God but if you have that faith in your soul then you will say Amen to everyone Amen to everyone Amen to everyone that shows you are saved you get to water baptism because you are saved sisters you throw away trousers because Brothers you throw away those the boys are wearing these days you begin walking like whatever you throw those things away because you are saved sisters you throw away makeup because you are saved we do communion because we are Sav thing we do as Believers we do it because we believe we don't do it to believe if you have received Revelation say Amen we don't do it to believe but we do it because we are believers that's why Jesus told Peter if you don't want me to wash your feet not a part of me so if you don't take communion is a clear sign you are not a part of him but if you part of him oh you will Sur of it you will partake of it praise the name of the Lord amen is someone receiving Revelation tonight say Amen it is commemoration all right amen I have a few more quotes here that I thought were very important for you now listen same message he says notice we want to go back and think Paul here is referring back to an Old Testament character in The Book of Genesis we take up the life of Abraham from the 12th chapter of Genesis God giving Abraham the promise and through Abraham would come the righteous seat and Abraham has believed by by many to be a Jew he was not when I read this I said many people believe that Abraham was a Jew but he was abrah was no Israelite you are quiet a prophet says he was not Abraham was a gentile a child a child from the city of and he became God's servant because he was different from anyone else but because of the election of God hallelujah amen are you not so glad yes sir you were like others but because of the election of God you are the Bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah you are not saved because you are a good person you are saved because Christ chose you no man seeks God I God I no man seeks God God seeks man if God loves you he so you and you are here and if you try to run away God will seek you God will seek you until he finds you you you cannot run away tell your neighbor you cannot run away run away my sister here you cannot run away if God saw you in him and God chose you in him then God s you because he loved you and you cannot sleep away from him hallelujah amen you are his and he's yours if you don't like it you better like it because you he will love you he will love you and the more you run away from him the more he will seek after you that's why I've seen people who have said my life has been a mess ever since I left Christ if God loves you and you backslide from the church there is nothing that you do will prosper why because you are his child he wants you in his house you cannot sleep away you cannot run away you may try to you may try to hide but if you are his and he is yours sin can never bu you completely because there is a seed of God in When sin bies you sister the SE of God in you will germinate so there is no way a seed of God can get lost you may have wounds out of trying to run away and you'll be a wounded child of God but you will still be a child of God so I don't know about you but as for me I don't want to have any wounds because of running if God takes you by the hand and you try to run away come on brother try it try to run away by the time you run away your hand will be twisted not going not going and by the time you settle now saying yes papa God I'm yours and your mine but your hand has [Applause] wounds as for me I don't want to fight I want just to come to him and say papa God I love you please take me receive me as you called me Hallelujah but a child of God cannot be lost I don't know about you but to me I feel this one excites me so much the gra you cannot get lost no matter what te and try whatever it you cannot get lost amen God six man Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him first and if we could stop just for a few moments and realize the great importance of that one thing that it was God who chose you not willing that you should perish but give to you the opportunity and called you and elected you to be his servant what could be more precious than that without you having a choice I know we make choices but I do not choose him I chose him because he chose me listen listen understand this God did not Choose You Even if you choose him it is for nothing we see Jesus he came he called Peter he called John he called one by one chose them one by one and then this woman came son of David have mercy on me uh you dog why are you looking for Words sincerely he chose some and left others he went at the pool of one man there he looked at many others some others were touching him but he just kicked themed walking another please and then he found this one he said you why are you here say I don't have anyone to help me for 30 years he said you want to help you you don't need to fall in the water I am here because I chose you rise up take up your bed and walk says what an opportunity to give you that opportunity and he called you and elected you to be his servant what could be more precious than without you having a choice it would be totally impossible for any man to seek God if you have something in your heart that loves God and seeks after God it means God chose you even when you sin you are guilt in your heart because you are not supposed to do that for he is by nature a sinner man and he has nothing within him to desire to give a a desire to serve God could you go to the pig and tell him he is wrong he's a pig by Nature could you tell him is that is wrong by Nature he's a pig you should tell him he would be a lamb but he is as satisfied as a pig you can tell him that he should be a lamb but satisfied as and I'm I'm happy that I'm not satisfied as a sinner if you are joking with what I'm saying you try it if you have not tried it before go in the world you will do everything they do you'll be happy when they happy they will be satisfied they will be satisfied but you will not brother Victor told me you would go there in the discs dance and dance but something would just come to him so what are you doing and then his friends will be like what's wrong with you come on but what was that it was because he was not satisfied and a sinner is satisfied as a sinner because his nature is a sinner and he says and here it is we are all Bor in sin shed in iniquity come to the world speaking by Nature a child of Disobedience without god without a hope the wrath of God abiding on us and by The Loving Grace of Christ in his Sovereign Grace and his omnipotence he knocks at your heart and he gives the Blessed opportunity and turned you around and sent you up up the road how could you turn that down changes your whole desire turns you around and starts you the other way and you will be silly to the world and you will all you will be Sil to the world but you will be blessed in the sight of God blessed are they that do hung and thirst for righteousness they shall be filled notice it was God it this is what God did what God called you had no will to call you could have no desire to call because your nature was completely contrary to it but in conclusion here he says but God by election he called you and he turned you around and set your affections towards Christ and the things above how could we turn that down then God showed in Abraham what we would what he would do for all for all that are called Not only was was this blessed promise of the resurrection and eternal life given to Abraham but to his SE after him they called the elected of I'm glad today I can say I'm the call and our Prophet spoke all those things in the message the communion so in other words why do we take the communion because we part of him inow Hallelujah am and we are designing the Lord's [Music] body praise the name of the Lord amen hallelujah amen amen I ask the deacons to come if the musicians can play Slowly are you not so glad because of his election amen hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah isn't he wonderful in that message a prophet says many of the churches have has closed communion that is just to their own church when they have their communion but here we are not a denomination we have open communion for all for we believe that every believer has a right to take the table of the Lord and to Fellowship around the good things of God with every believer regardless of greed color or whatever he may be that all have been made to drink of the self same blessing and that is Jesus Christ hallelujah amen are there deons [Music] here as they come we can look look at 1 Corinthians chapter [Music] 11 [Music] where is Deon [Music] Enoch [Music] [Music] First Corinthians brother if you can put it on the screen for US 11: 23 for I have received of the Lord that which I also which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said and listen to these words carefully he said take it this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had Saed saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as of as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and a sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are Ched of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefor my brethren when he come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that he come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come and we see here when the prophet prophet of God uh comes to this part he says you know taring one for another if you know of something that you need to put right you put it right first before you take on the on the communion tonight praise God I'm waiting for
