[22:11] we can point you to go Jesus Christ
[22:16] amen let's take a Bible say man
[22:22] um Second Kings chapter two
[22:24] foreign
[22:34] I don't know if you are using English so
[22:37] um
[22:40] you want to read both or you can follow
[22:43] in in your version
[22:48] so let's say for the sake of time let me
[22:51] read the King James version
[22:56] so second Kings chapter 2 we are reading
[22:59] from verse 9.
[23:03] [Music]
[23:05] and it came to pass
[23:07] let's let's go back to verse 8.
[23:11] and Elijah took his mantle
[23:14] and wrap it together and smooth the
[23:17] waters and there and they were divided
[23:21] so that they too went over on dry ground
[23:26] and it came to pass when they were gone
[23:29] over that Elijah said unto Elijah
[23:33] ask what
[23:35] I shall do for thee before I be taken
[23:39] away from thee and Elijah said I pray
[23:42] thee let a double portion of thy Spirit
[23:45] be upon me
[23:47] and he said thou has asked a hard thing
[23:50] nevertheless if thou see me when I am
[23:54] taken from thee it shall be so unto thee
[23:58] but if
[23:59] not it shall not be so and it came to
[24:03] pass
[24:05] as they still went on and talked that
[24:08] behold they appeared a chariot of fire
[24:10] and Horses of fire and pathered them
[24:13] both Asanda and Elijah went up
[24:16] by a whale went into heaven
[24:19] and Elijah saw it and he cried my father
[24:22] my father and The Chariot of Israel and
[24:26] the horsemen thereof and he saw him no
[24:29] more
[24:30] and he took
[24:33] hold of his own clothes and ran them in
[24:37] two pieces he took up also the mantle of
[24:40] Elijah that fell from him
[24:42] and went back and stood by the bank of
[24:45] Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah
[24:48] that fell from him and smote the waters
[24:51] and said where is the Lord God of Elijah
[24:56] and when he also had Smith in the waters
[24:59] departed hida and Tita and Elijah went
[25:03] over amen oh Jesus this is your word
[25:07] tonight
[25:12] [Music]
[25:14] amen let's be seated
[25:17] Hallelujah so tonight I
[25:21] I I just want to share a small thought
[25:24] here
[25:27] amen amen we see Elisha
[25:32] um ask a question
[25:34] Elijah asked the question
[25:36] he said where is the Lord God of Elijah
[25:43] Hallelujah man because he he knew the
[25:47] God that was with Elijah
[25:51] and so when Elijah was taking because
[25:55] there was something that he needed
[25:58] he needed the gods
[26:02] Hallelujah man and we know in this our
[26:06] day
[26:07] God has sent an Elijah
[26:11] Hallelujah man and God took his Elijah
[26:15] and the question that many people
[26:17] especially the young ones
[26:21] the question that we like asking where
[26:23] is the god of William Brown
[26:27] and so my short Title Here is Elijah's
[26:31] God is here
[26:46] hallelujah amen because Elijah is
[26:56] not going with William Brothers
[27:20] about what he needed
[27:24] Elijah told him
[27:26] if you can see me
[27:29] if you can see me
[27:32] then you will get what you're asking for
[27:35] our deco furniture today for you to see
[27:39] the god of your life
[27:41] you must come back to the message
[27:45] amen I tell you the pillar of fire
[27:52] but you um did not go with the prophet
[27:55] the pillar of Christ did not go with the
[27:59] problem
[28:00] Hallelujah I mean it is
[28:19] what do you use that anointing for
[28:22] um
[28:27] he did not put his hand on his head
[28:30] he started crying oh wait where can I
[28:34] get a boat
[28:36] he did not need a bridge
[28:42] and when he said where's the Lord God of
[28:45] Elijah
[28:47] oh he's smarter water
[28:53] and when he did what Elijah did
[28:56] Jordan opened this way and when you go
[29:01] by what the prophet has taught us
[29:13] it wasn't the man too but it was
[29:19] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and
[29:24] today and forever
[29:29] because let's go to Exodus
[29:33] Exodus chapter 13.
[29:37] read it for us
[29:43] the title is where
[29:46] is the Lord God of Elijah um
[29:51] giving the answer Elijah's God is here
[29:57] hallelujah Amina don't think he's
[29:59] somewhere
[30:02] if you think like that you make a
[30:04] mistake
[30:07] he is here because he has promised
[30:11] to be in you
[30:14] even until the consummation
[30:18] of the world
[30:20] so so long as there is
[30:26] in his people
[30:28] Exodus chapter 12 I mean chapter
[30:36] 13.3 21 and 22.
[30:46] foreign
[31:10] in the in the first Exodus Hallelujah
[31:14] the Lord went before them
[31:21] to lead them to lead them the way
[31:26] so you see God was leading them
[31:33] show them their way that's why in this
[31:37] end times
[31:48] so he says the Lord went before them by
[31:52] day in the pillar of a cloud to lead
[31:54] them the way
[31:58] and by Night natural in the pillar of in
[32:02] the pillar of fire to give them lights
[32:17] [Music]
[33:09] to take foreign
[34:10] that he sent a pillar of fire
[34:13] and I believe many of you have seen the
[34:15] pillar of fire above God's Prophet
[34:20] have we seen that um
[34:23] and many times we think that Pillar of
[34:26] Fire left with the prophets
[34:32] with God's children today
[34:37] and I can tell you amen that he is still
[34:41] unveiling himself
[34:54] I gave some some pictures to our brother
[34:57] here one way
[34:59] I was preaching in stock of Hallelujah
[35:03] and I was speaking about the presence of
[35:06] the Lord
[35:07] and the presence of the Lord many times
