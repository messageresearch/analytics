foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] any money [Music] I promise [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hallelujah oh thank you Jesus the Bible says [Music] Matthew chapter 16. Mateo is I love it when we open up and just worship him in the spirit of Liberty but in heaven we will continuously do that so here we have to pause the moment and go to the word because the word is the most important thing here on Earth we will need it to get there Matthew 16 verse 13. all right so we're reading um I'm reading the name of the Lord Jesus came into arm and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah saw one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say he that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed that thou Simon by Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I rebuild my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt Bine on Earth shall be born in heaven and whatsoever thou shall lose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven just read up to verses 19. our yes amen you may be seated so this morning I'm speaking on part two of what I spoke on I think it was Wednesday or Sunday on the power of Revelation tell someone the power of Revelation I hear I will not take long again this morning maybe I'll speak for about an hour we usually here can preach even up to two hours the people here can take it in some Churches can not even go 30 minutes foreign but usually I always want to do an hour because then people can still listen to you by the time you are you are done so uh how many are promising to give their undivided attention lay everything aside and at this time I'm also laying myself aside I have nothing good to tell you just like Jesus said without him I can do nothing yes the power of Revelation Jesus comes and asks and actually this in this scripture where we read this is where the whole foundation of the church is when I say the church I don't mean the denominations this is a thing that has really confused the people in our generation they have thought that you need to be a member of a religion in order to go to heaven Jesus did not begin any of this religion yes he's not the founder of the religion but Jesus when he came he came with one purpose sin is unbelief of the truth when God gives his wife and the people refuse to believe sin is not small attributes when you refuse to believe what God says in his words because of the things you did yeah because of what you refuse to believe why we are not going to heaven like the works we do already the Bible says the works of the righteousness I am not going to make it because of my works of righteousness [Music] it's not a building [Music] was asking the disciples for them to tell him what the people think that he is a child now please understand that Jesus was flesh and blood again and yes just like me standing before you today he was born by somebody yes they even knew their mother and he was just like them and here he was asking them who do people say I am now remember that there are three officers one more office is that of sonship in someone that God has decided to reveal himself in cartoon who is God in the Book of John chapter 4 verse 24. it says God is a spirit brother if you can put up the scripture for the people God is a spirit so God is not flesh America [Music] foreign God so God is the same way God is a spirit you can't count God you cannot see his beginning unquenchable spirit [Music] and that is through throughout the generations the Bible even says we are born in sin even if your mother and father we are married in church we are all borns we are born as the Bible say we are born in in in sin we were shaped in the rooms we were born the way we were not supposed to be born children of God born the way we are born physically speaking who is God God is the spirit God is the world God is going to give birth to any son that son must be a wild child not a flesh child secretary that is why all of us no matter what our title is born in China that is why we have to be born again born again Guru Lucifer Lucifer fought now one with Mike and Lucifer was defeated so the bat of angels became the Battle of men when Lucifer came on Earth happened good Sota now it was not crawling it was like I am Charlie Charlie and the devil came in that Christian then that creature came to Eve another inspiration of Saturn did God say you should not eat of every tree it was excited to defend the world we can eat of every other tree of knowledge and she was excited she even added you shouldn't even touch it so he said now you will not die and Eve ate from that tree did she what's that what did she eat yeah by the time she walked away from that creature again she had a seat yeah a new way that's why Cain is Jesus was the seed of the woman yes yes [Music] let me paint this to all right now okay it's done stand just facing the people and now we are the two young ladies please come yes come and stand right there now I want to demonstrate something thank you Pakistan I want to show you something a demonstration is it gives you imagery this is just to show none of you is married none of you is Eve okay so here was one woman and her name was Eve and here is another woman both of them foreign foreign [Music] foreign so one woman became pregnant um because remember the serpent touched her and then she gave birth to twins [Music] Katie The Other Woman um hide the voice she said how will it be yeah how was it going to be by the words be it done to me foreign foreign foreign the first Adam Fair Adams what God decided in order to redeem yeah how was the first Adam born think about it was born by what yes oh God is children God gives birth to them by speaking why do you think you are here why do we go to churches to his kingdom and hear the first Adam was born by the spoken word was also born she became pregnant of Jesus so who was Jesus yes who was Jesus okay let me ask you do you know a hen um chili cookies it becomes isn't it that is that the child of a goat is is a god when a cow gives birth the child of a cow is what if you say this is this one is a cow now yes Crystal Jesus Christ who is the son foreign there is nothing like God that the big one God the small one and God the flying ones God is God God is a spirit hallelujah amen and that Spirit came in the womb of marriage so when Jesus was working yes foreign for the father is in me amen you have been with me all this time man has been so confused with these Mysteries so what did they decide to do they decided to devise that we have Evolution Evolution but we have gone changes [Music] the man is confused a connection between man and animals they don't know what it is you see them just shooting just without the reasons Bible and you read it very well you will notice nowhere in the Bible it says Adam nowhere in the genealogies [Music] it begins with says and also in the New Testament again foreign [Music] he has revealed himself in three uh uh dispensations that is all three offices it is when was the son of Mana woman was a prophet one who died on Calvary oh yeah all the way and when he died he concluded his office now but Jesus who was the son of man was also Son of God he's the son of God Son of God is the holy spirit dispensation foreign foreign this is Saint Peter's Basilica yeah and that was deception they don't get married if they say that is their Foundation it was a misapplication and even Jesus was not meaning Peter Peter as that rock because Jesus said this watch yes Flesh and Blood God and upon this yes himself I mean praise the name of the Lord in a few minutes I'm going to be finished doesn't mean I'll be done I'm just going to be finished now listen the power of Revelations the true church that knows the true Revelations will know what to what the Bible says Jesus Christ who is Jesus Christ yes tell your neighbor Jesus Christ is and everything the Bible says Bible when the Bible says a woman will not be a pastor um but why do we have women preachers today we have women preachers today because they have rejected the absolutely because we cannot debate with the Bible the women in the churches why do they wear trousers when the Bible is very clear because they have rejected why do men marry more than one women the Bible says foreign foreign [Music] there is nothing like a tree in God that is the god of the black and Romans Hallelujah one day that Jesus Christ came to Paul yes this was the same that Moses met in the burning bush and the voice spoke to Paul when he saw that pillow Fighters so you wanted to know his name is so before God was born he said I am who I am that's all you need to know I am who I am but after he was born in a form of a man with financial amount now we had a name because remember he came by an Angel not by the name of Jesus and Jesus means yes Jehovah foreign Nancy and that is why all the people around people now I give you a homework this place go and study these things all the people in the Bible that you were baptized it was in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ no one has ever been baptized what is that name what is your name baptize them in the name of the father who is the father when you go in the book of Isaiah the Bible says the father himself so father is Lord that is the name of the Father the name of the father is so so who is the song we want to know his name I can't know his name is is the one that created us yes so what's the name of the song yeah yes the name of the sun Jesus yes he's the son of God Jesus Yeshua is the name there is a song We Sing Jesus is the name yes yes Jesus is the name Jesus is the name Jesus is the name of the Lord that's the name yes what about the Holy Spirit In the book of Colossians he says there's a Mysteries Christo wait a moment I thought it was the Holy Spirit now father son holy ghosts our offices offices the uncountable spirit who came as a father in The Old Testaments the Bible says he came to his own and his own understood him it was the same same God of the Old Testament he came and put on flights the glory of the father full of grace um mourinha of area his father name is the name of the father is foreign Crystal that is the name the Bible says the whole family of Heaven is named after that name demons everything we do we should do it in that name is someone today but that's all right and I'll read you one last scripture Hallelujah that's taken me a long time to Veer off my preaching to fear of my preaching I've not feared off my preaching for a long time but today uh the Holy Spirit directed me a different direction now listen to verse to verse 37. 36 he says surely that God has made that same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ foreign [Music] [Music] Hallelujah foreign repentance means living what you were believing or living what you were doing or that was wrong whatever turning around many people in churches today that have not repented we have people in the churches that's why we sing songs like I left the life of sin painfully you know there are many songs we sing like that I gave it all up you know I was a wish I gave you that up there's some younger men here you know going out there foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign you remember that the the prison guard when he when he he was when uh the angel of the Lord came into prison he said that uh the captain was free his brothers went with him at his house so that's how urgent it is foreign for the dimension of your sins whatever you did in your life what was wrong it is like magic if you believe in the name of Jesus sins are no longer remember God says you are perfect [Applause] that's the first thing that happens the second last thing is then you receive our job I love that part some people tell the others I don't want to receive what people get hallelujah amen God himself foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] to live away from adultery to live away from foreign our family is meant to receive our homes need to receive but without revelation we need revelation of the world first so we need to repent in the name of Jesus Christ I'm no longer reading anything and um he came to me we shared these
