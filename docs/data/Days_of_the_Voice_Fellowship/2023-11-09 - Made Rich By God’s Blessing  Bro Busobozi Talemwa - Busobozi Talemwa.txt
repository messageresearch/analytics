started full-time Ministry when I was 13 years and uh at 15 years that was in the Anglican Church at 15 years the Lord showed me more scriptures revealed more of his word to me showed me that there was more truth in the word that was not in my denomination and by that he revealed to me the end time message it also started by me being baptized in much water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and God has been good since he gave me riches that the world cannot give and when you receive those riches you can never be poor again amen and he gave me my beautiful wife can you stand up all right

made Rich by God's blessing how many are in senior six okay all of you right here that's wonderful I was going to ask you to come and sit close and I'm glad you I am made Rich by God is blessing the Bible says the blessing of the Lord it maketh rich and he adds no sorrow on it how many have ever heard of a Preacher a prophet called William Marion Bram Bram here is what he said in 1965 he said I'm so glad for that that he being rich in [Music] Mercy he was just if he was just rich in money if he was just riching materials which he is but yet the greatest thing is he is reaching Mercy now he is saying that God is rich in money he's rich in materials tell somebody God is Rich God is Rich so is there anybody who is poor here today if you are poor I want to say you can be made Rich this morning Hallelujah and the riches of God cannot cannot fall away when it comes it stays to the to the candidates I want you to be made Rich this morning I want you to be made Rich by the blessing of God you know if you're made Rich by God you can never be poor now when we talk about riches many times we think it is only money no it is more than money it is wisdom it is knowledge it is understanding that can never fall away it will be permanent if it is from God listen when the blessing comes from God it can never be removed from by man but what comes by man will be removed by man but this morning I want that blessing of God that will make me Rich I can never be poor hallelujah amen now I want you to listen here in the Book of Genesis let us see where we get this idea from in Genesis CH 22 vers one I am going to read it only in English so if you you are if you want it in lugand read it in your Bible so listen to me because there are quite several verses and I want to keep there 18 verses so I want to read and you you follow me if you have the scripture you can put it up there and it came to pass after these things things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thy only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moria and offer him here for there for a b offering upon uh one of the mountains which I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up Al in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his younger men with him and Isaac his son and Cave the wood uh for the burn offering and Rose up and went unto the place which God had told him then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off and and Abraham said unto his young man abide ye here with the US and I and the Lord will go Yonder and worship and come again to you and Abraham took the wood of the B offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went uh both of them together and Isaac and spake unto Abraham his father and said my father and he said here am I my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for a burn offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a bur offering so they went both both of them together and they came to a place which God had told him of and Abraham built an outter there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here mine and he said lay not thy hand upon the Lord neither do thou anything unto him him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing that thou Hast not withheld thy son thy only son from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram CAU in a Thicket by his thorns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for a burn offering in the stad of his son and Abraham called the name of the Lord the uh of that place Jehovah praise God as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself I have sworn sayth the Lord for because thou Hast done this thing and Hast not withheld thy son thy only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying but I want to show you here that Israel is a nation that came out of Abraham and they also came out out of Isaac you see so they are they have a covenant this is the Covenant that God gave them that convenant of the blessing of God flows through that Lage you see they were blessed by God no man can cast them right now as I'm speaking to you Israel is being attacked from many corners is from Lebanon is attacking Hamas from Gaza is attack and other terrorists other nations that hate Israel and everybody is fighting against isra people are going to the streets all over the world by thousands and thousand demonstrating that we want you know Israel to seize the fire but do you realize the target of these people is to kill Israel wipe it out of the M their plan is not for them to live in peace their plan is for Israel to be wiped away but Israel is saying This Is Our Land God gave it to us we we will not leave we can live with the rest of the tribes as long as you allow us to live in peace with you but the others are saying no we will wipe you away Iran for example they saying the same they saying the same Israel must be wiped away they Israel with a passion but do you know what there is nothing they can do to destroy Israel and the Bible says pray for the Peace of Jerusalem every Bible lover every Jesus Lover must not only love Israel but they must pray for Israel and I tell you what Israel has a covenant with God and that Covenant cannot be removed is a covenant that started with with Abraham and it was given to Abraham and that it would follow through Isaac do you know where all these others came came from Hagar haar was a mistress of Abraham and ha got a son and that son was called is and he the he's the father of great grandfather all those Hamas and that is true it is historical isical Israel comes from the lineage of Isaac and God had given Abraham a promise and you know out of what happened because he told him listen to me he said now Abraham you remember Abraham at first never had a child and God promised him I will give you a son I will give you a son trust me believe me Abraham and Sarah believed God and God gave them a son and when Abra when when when ISAC arrived the child of the promise then God came back again and he said Abraham I know you believe me so here I have one more thing to say to give me your son your only son give him to me many times when we hold something we don't want to let go whatever you have whatever you have if it's not Jesus it is nothing it is nothing if you think you have knowledge it is nothing if you think you have wisdom it's nothing if you think you have money it is nothing it's all nothing without him all nothing without him and I can prove that to you by the Bible he is a rich man who came to Jesus and spoke to him and said my good Master what can I do inherit etal life Jesus told him go and do the law I have fulfilled The Works of the law from the time I was a child ah Jesus told him you have done well but there is one more thing go sell all your riches give it to the poor come follow me the rich man was sad he went side in his if you don't believe Jesus you will go a side I always say everybody that hears the gospel being preached and you don't believe it whether you believe it or not you can never be the same again if you if you don't believe it you will go away but if you believe it you will be happy you will be happy you will not only be happy you will also be rich now this Young Ruler he went side because he did not have Jesus the only thing he needed to do is what Jesus said sell everything and take and follow me oh are we ready to do that s everything and follow him we cannot trust anything else we only trust him sell everything and follow me and here then comes we go back to Abraham so then God comes back to Abraham and says now Abraham my friend I want your son give me your son your only son you must be willing to give up he said I will do whatever God says You must be willing to say I will do whatever God says as long as it is his word I will do whatever he says and Abraham said son come follow me he took some of his servants and together they went and the Bible tells me when Abraham reached a place he saw the place that God told him and he knew to he thought to himself there is no way he can go to that place with with these people who are not in the convenant so he looked back and he told all his servants please stay here with the donkeys me and my son are going up on the hill toship the Bible says he that will not leave his mother and father and brother and sister and blah blah blah blah blah is not worthy of me sometimes people want to believe the message they want baptize in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ but they fear what mama will say what papa will say me my mother was my mother disowned me because of this truth but after some years right now as I'm speaking to you I am her pastor for three years for three years she couldn't look at me I couldn't look at her because of this truth if you lose if you save your life you lose it but if you lose your life you will save it and Abraham looked at the servants and told them stay with the oh I love my mom I believe in obeying a parent but when it comes to the word I obeying the word so even me at that time I told my mama I told my brothers I told my sisters stay with the donkeys as for me I am going up on the mountain I am going to worship God I'm going to believe every word of God maybe if you have a friend who doesn't want you to believe the word you have a girlfriend or a boyfriend who is nagging you all the time doesn't want you to believe the word you must be able to tell them stay with the donkeys with a donkey as for me I am going on the mountain I am going on the mountain to Worship the Lord hallelujah hallelujah and then we find you know that they stayed with the donkeys didn't know what was going to take place on the mountain but guess what Abraham went on the mountain with his son Isaac and when they arrived there Abraham Isaac realized there is something missing his father had told him that we cannot worship without an offering so if you come to church come with an offering don't come empty-handed come with an offering are you hearing me it's a way of worship and first offering is your broken heart your contrite spirit you must be willing to submit yourself to the word of God whatever he says I will believe it and then now you can talk about the money now here they didn't have an offering so the he knew somehow God is able to provide a sacrifice do what God is word say will do the rest God will do the rest God will do the rest hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God will always show up will always show up and when they arrived there you know he Abraham put in his eort fear not don't fear anything at all don't fear anything at all because the blessing of God gives wisdom the blessing of God brings remembrance the blessing of God will give you what you need in the time you need it now those of you who are not reading and you playing around okay you have one little chance remain right now there are two things you can do you can really be serious with God and forsake your evil ways and repent your sins and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior Point number one and then you trust God Point number two you you do as much effort as you can in this remaining God doesn't need a year or two years God needs a moment Hallelujah a moment you mean to tell me if I was not serious for two years my God is able in a moment in one day two days three you know you can read something but the last minute and it comes in the ex who will do that go will provide a sacrifice so you can trust him knowing that he cannot fail you oh my God he used to show me things which were are coming in our next he even showed me my results before our God is a God of All Seasons if you trust him in your life if you trust him in your education if you trust him in everything you do God cannot fail you Hallelujah and while there Abraham you know God called the place Jehovah and he began to untie his son to un his son removing the the shackles that him and he hugged him and he took the sacrifice together with his son and he offered it to the Lord God provided a sacrifice here is the sa to being rich into the voice of God this is the voice of God the gospel which is preached to you here happen to it trusting God wholehearted being ready to sacrifice everything for the word of God let me say that again sacrifice your cultures s you know if they told you know before you go into exams it will help you sacrifice it if you don't sacrifice it you will not pass forgive me if I've annoyed anybody but that is the Naked Truth if you're hiding a ter you are not going to pass trust that that is why during the time of exam you know teachers you've seen that many times some of you may not know what happen during the time of exam you see a lot of children fainting why is because of these cultures those things they put on them those things they do and sometimes they react negatively the devil will give you something he will take something from you and then give you something and something he gives you will not be permanent also
