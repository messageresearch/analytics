[Music] amen I read in English as well but we have this treasure in aan vsels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed Hallelujah always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body amen amen you may be seated this evening I'm speaking uh to you on the subject wounded but not destroyed wounded wounded say what I said not what you are reading okay wounded but not destroyed one time I did not prepare to give this story but it it just came to my memory years ago I read it I think I think brother bam talked about it in the message when love is projected and he was speaking about mother Oppam and so it was wounded and you know but you see God has a way that he led it from the wild and it came all the way to the house of the Prophet there were many people who were always going to the house of banam for prayers many of them of course we are wounded wounded because of sickness sometimes you know other spiritual conditions and you know others were dying you know the the world is wounded for the mo for the to the for the most [Music] part and so they are looking for a savior and and um and many of them get destroyed we find that many people today even today are committing suicide uh many of which are young people and they're losing their life because they they cannot find Solace they cannot find peace of mind when they are disappointed or when they let you know it is as if you have no savior went went was wounded and and you know the prophet gave back its life so I was thinking how much more the Sons and Daughters of God you know who are wounded when they are wounded doesn't God have a balm for us doesn't he have medicine for us does he have a solution for us well of course some of well of course some of you might say yes he has my problem is bigger well of course and their speciality and they will tell you whether they can be able to handle that wound or not I remember some years ago not even years months ago when General was short and you know they were in the car and he was short and you know his daughter died as a result but then he himself was shot as well but not killed he was not destroyed but he was wounded and and so they took him at a small and where I think I don't remember the name where they could him and later on when he came out of the hospital he said he had been wounded and he had been shot at but the bullet couldn't be taken out so but they treated him you remove it you may lose the patient and and so he was wounded and I'm going to deal with that and then I I I he became a soldier of the army of the Lord and I believe he's my brother so I am a soldier also of the army of the Lord I am recruited Hallelujah do I have some people here who are recruited we are recruited to this Army this is an overcoming Army amen this is an army which is indestructible seen an army which is invisible where you can say that that is an army which cannot be destroyed no matter what you do to that Army you cannot destroy you had many armies before many men who fought and they won battles but you see I can talk I can take time to speak about each of but tonight I want ask speak about the army of the Lord Christians when we are recruited to this Army we are equipped with the necessary weapons to overcome our enemy each of us is in a battle Christianity is the hardest thing in the world it is not as easy as something things Christianity is not a Bed of Roses it is a battle we fight every day we fight daily we struggle daily don't you think because we say we are believer that you know we can be able to do everything the Bible says who who does that with EAS 100% with EAS even a man who came to Jesus and he said I have done I've lived according to the law everything all my life Jesus looked at him and he said it's all right you are fine you have fulfilled the law but there is one more thing he said go sell everything you have give it to the poor come follow me and the Bible says he went away so it was not easy for him to walk that road it is not easy for anyone to walk the Christian Journey but I tell you what at the end of it all it will pay off for all the things you sacrifice for all the things you fought for the perseverance for the long suffering for the patience for the fighting for the praying at the end of the day when we leave these bodies it will all become clear it will all mean something but right now it seems as if it is impossible but I tell you what the army of the Lord cannot be destroyed and Apostle Paul was one of those in that army and uh in Acts 14 verse 19 he said and there came th certain Jews from Antioch and ionium who persuaded the people and having ston Paul Drew him out of the city supposing he had been dead something I want you to see today hallelujah hallelujah if you open your spiritual ears God will speak to you in a special way today how to open all right now I want you to see here is a man of God that was called in a powerful calling do you know how he was called a pillar of light came and shined where he was and a voice came out of it and he said so so why do you persecute and he said who are you my lord then he said I am Jesus it is hard for the to kick against the priest let me tell you if you were called by God you can try to run but you can never run away from this you can never run away from this voice others may try to discourage you but you can never run away from this voice many things may happen in your life in my life to try to discourage you but even if I wanted to I cannot run away from this voice because why my soul is Anchor whereby whenever whatever I run I still come back here whever you run you may run in your thoughts you may run in your actions you may run in your mind but you will still come back because you are anchored amen and we we find that there are others who will run away we are not afraid about those because they are not anchored but when the ship is anchored no matter where the waves beat and pushed the Sheep will remain un there's something I'm coming to here and there came so now here Paul having received a great calling in his life he started to go out with Zeal with the power of the Holy Ghost preaching and and and you know and and working miracles and now we see some when he reached this this place called I think it was called listra something like that and um and uh the people the Jews they connived among each other let us kill him so they got stones and start stoning imagine they stoned him and they drew him out of the city they stoned him and they pulled him after stoning him and they pulled him out of the city thre him out there and they thought he Hallelujah hallu someone has not received Revelation while I'm talking about these things I want you to look at your life when they pulled Paul after stoning him they thought he was dead I have a question for you why did they do that to him it was because of what he stood for now when I tell it is the devil who did it you will say no it is the people no it was the devil because the devil knows those that have a mark of God on them and the devil is interested in only one to kill to destroy to completely remove you that's the purpose of the devil that's the purpose of the devil in my life in your life as an individual he wants you to quit he wants you to go away he wants you to be disced he doesn't want you to serve God he will do everything he can he will bring up something he will bring a sin in your life which will discourage you he will bring people in your life who will discourage you he will bring things in your life which will discourage you by wounding you but the purpose of the devil is to kill you is to destroy you and here he had thought he had killed and destroyed Paul and Drew him out of the city him out out of the place where he was supposed to be and he thought they thought he had died one of these days I need to preach on that when the devil thought I had died there is a time when the devil does something in your life and he begins to think he's dead this one he will not come back you know when the devil gives you a knock out he thinks ah this one is gone there is not coming back there is no resurrecting but I tell you what brother there is a bride there is a church even she may be wounded she can never be destroyed hallelujah amen and this is exactly what happened was wounded the devil thought he had there was a time theil thought you die amen bu you in things and thought you are die you in desires and thought you will die am I preaching to someone here today bu you into actions things that you amen that made you go away from your place that made you even lose your desire of going to church that made you lose your desire of the love of the world whereby even when you lift up your hand you don't feel like worshiping anymore because the devil removed you from your place and whenever he saw you in that condition he was always rejoicing this time she's dead this time let me tell you brother even if the devil says that you are dead today is dead tell I'm not dead not dead I will not die I'm not going to die Hallelujah I am not going to die I'm going to remain living I'm going to be a Christian I'm going to serve God whether the devil likes it or not amen hallelujah that's why when you discouraged do what the devil tells you not to do when the Devil Makes You doubt doubt your doubts am I preaching to someone today when a Devil Makes You doubt the word of God doubt his that doubt doubt it amen because he wants you to he wants to make you doubt the ability of God to deliver youil I doubt that I doubt that are you not going to quit Christianity devil I doubt that are you not are you not really overcome devil I doubt that do you think you will make it devil I doubt that I'm only going to believe what the word of God has intended for me and when they St Paul they thought he had died and they drew him out of the city supposing he had been dead hallelujah hallelujah how bit as the disciples stood round about him he rose upu was standing around him come on now answer me the disciples not drunkers not smokers not adter not fornicators are you hearing me these are the things the devil wants to kill us with and these are the people who are beating him but when they threw him away the disciples stood around about no matter how you are feeling just keep coming to church even if you feel you are you are dead there is no life in you keep coming to church don't give up don't accept to give up don't accept to be discouraged amen amen because if you come you are going to be surrounded by a brother by a sister who believes like you believe who will pray for you who will encourage you amen and do you know what it's going to happen you will rise up again amen that's why we keep coming to church three times a week or four times of five in the book of I used to do it every day so that I can be surrounded with the disciples but you you are always too busy you want to be always surrounded by unbelievers even if you're a good believer soon you will begin to unbel because unbelief is surrounding you tell your neighbor I want to be surrounded by hallelujah hallelujah how bit we notice he says and the next day he departed with Barnabas to B to dab and when they had preached the gospel to that City and had told many they returned again to lisra and to ionium and Antioch why did the devil want Paul De because of God's purpose in Paul's [Applause] Ministry why does the devil want you dead why does he want to discourage you why does he want to destroy you because God has a purpose in your life we we had it on Sunday hindrances the devil brings hindrances things not accomplish the purpose of but let me tell you nothing can defeat God and the devil didn't want him to preach but the Bible says when he was surrounded by Believers amen he rose up he rose up and when he rose up he didn't say I almost died let me quit but he said I almost di why unto me if I preach not the where did we stop where did we stop hallelujah oh man like that women like that who are not afraid to look in the devil's face when ever brings them down they rise up again and they take the sword of the word and they live the life of their we must leave our purpose the devil cannot hinder that he can only hinder that if we let him but if you don't let him he becomes powerless before you hallelujah amen am I preaching to someone tonight he becomes powerless Hallelujah and when he and when he rose up he took the the scriptures and they went into the City and began preaching and they told many and they returned again to lra and to and even the BL even the bless where the devil thought he would kill them from Hallelujah they went back and preached I have a word of Prophecy for you tonight even the place that the devil thought he would finish you God will turn that trial into a blessing it is out of that same trial that he fought you with that he wounded you that God wants to use you you turn that into a blessing isn't God marvelous isn't wonderful Hallelujah God Specializes things thought impossible he can do hallelujah hallelujah many people ask me amen don't you ever feel like quitting don't you ever feel like giving up I tell I tell them people listen to me I felt like that many many many times but each time I bounc back this time I bounc back not because I'm strong but there is one thing I want you to know there is a treasure in this vessel there is a power in me which is greater than an atomic bomb than a nuclear bomb it is so powerful that even when I fall he raises me up even when I'm wounded he healed me hallelujah amen that that power of Darkness cannot destroy hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah and we find out here in 2 Corinthians 11:3 and and Paul Apostle Paul continued to boss in his sufferings for Christ are they Ministers of Christ I speak as a fool I am Mo in laborers more abundant in Stripes Oh Glory to God is boasting because of the stripes he received because of Christ he is rejoicing because of the wounds he receive if your wound is not going to kill you God is going to use it for his glory god allowed you to go through that for his glory more frequent in death of what Paul said he died many times you cannot say no he's saying he died and resurrected many times they stoned him threw him to thinking he day is dead is it true he was dead maybe it was true but when he was surrounded by Believers he rose up again you may be dead but when you are surrounded by the world you must rise up againu are you different from anyone no we are not special because we are made out of iron or out of gold we are made out of clay just like everywhere but what makes us special is the treasure that is in Hidden Earth the life of God the spirit of God that he has hid in us that makes me special yes sir of the Jews five times received I 40 Stripes [Music] one th was I beaten with was stoned we have read about that thce I suffered ship a night and a day I have been in the deep in jours often in Perils of of the Heathen sorry in the Perils of waters in Perils of robbers per by my own countrymen Paul was robbed Paul was Shipwrecked Paul was among even some people who were his supposed to be his friends Brothers close associates they also gave him trouble they betrayed him there is nothing bad as [Music] betrayal e e e e e e e e e e e e e they [Music] [Music] that's [Music] we advantage right for music listening to Christian music you know let me tell you if you have the spirit of God in you you want go to Comedy to bring you Joy did you know why many of people in our generation are addicted to Comedy because they depressed they [Music] wounded and so they need comedy they will laugh the one giving comedy and the ones receiving the comedy after the session they both go back into their but for us oh hallelujah hallelujah you begin amen going into something else the stor re the dark clouds rise they won't worry me while you are singing your heart is being mened your wounds are being attended to they won't worry me for arm shall within the arms of God He Walks With Me unn over shall harm me I am Shel The Arms Of God you know the people who wrote these songs they were going through tough times they were wounded they were wounded one of them you know lost everything everything and when they asked him how are you he said all and there was a song is well and another a song because I can face tomorrow because all fear and another I mean these were songs WR because of people who were [Music] wounded when Believers are wounded find sess in Christ because the purpose of God cannot be destroyed hallelujah amen the prophet of God says now we would think also today upon destructions trying to destroy we have Christ's promise we think of the Hebrew children when God had a purpose for them when they were down in Babylon and the furnace was hit seven times hotter than it ever was to try and destroy the purpose of God and all Babylon was on a ra they were determined Satan was to destroy the purpose of God for he knew those children was going to into the furnace hallelujah hallelujah so he made the furnace when they heed it seven times old to be sure that the program of God would be destroy but God wanted to display his power and all Babylon and Hell could not defeat that purpose amen yes sir oh it's unfortunate my wife is not here I don't know whether streaming is back or when we're leaving Ethiopia you know God spoke to my wife by the way I've never give another interpretation of usually God gives me interpretation of these things I had never got this one but just came to me now God spoke to her and and showed her you know were happening in Uganda at first God took her to hell and he showed a meeting in hell and it was demons that we had sat they had called for a meeting and what was the agenda the agenda was to destroy the Young Generation to destroy all the young people with Immortal living and life of God and and then when he showed her that he brought her back to us well the other part of it I won't say but I thought it meant something which need it was brother bam said that every word of God is has um um a compound meaning but now it comes to me God was trying to speak to us he's showing us the purpose of Satan the plan of the devil to destroy the young people in the message destroy them why because he was giving us a mandate to come down here and be part of the eort of the Holy Ghost to take them out of the bond of darkness and I tell you what God has fought this ministry the devil has fought this ministry he will fight continue to fight that's why we need to pray I don't know how many people pray for me in the church but you need to pray for me because when the devil sees something that is going to hinder his plan then he will try his best he will hit the furnace seven times to completion he will complete his wrath to try and defeat the purpose of but the prophet says no sir no matter if they could have he that furnace million times hter it would have never destroyed the purpose of God oh my goodness I tell you what brother the devil could not destroy the purpose of God theed me from coming to where am I now here I am this to start even H you to come but where are you now let me tell you the devil cannot hinder God's purpose I don't care how much he fights I don't care how much he will heat up the furnace purpose of God cannot be defeated and quite frankly I believe sometimes when I'm under inspiration I say things and so I believe there's going to be a generation Rising real real real people gen that are going to stand for God in our generation God wants to show that and he would bring Deliverance to whever whomsoever he desired to bring it he brought it to me did he bring it to you hallelujah amen he would bring Deliverance to whever he desire to bring it and nothing would interfere with his program tell your neighbor nothing speak it like a Believer tell him nothing interfere with a program of God hallelujah amen so when they hit that f did s mess know they were coming from that fness you do not know but let me prophesy a prophy something that speaks about your future so let me not prophesy to you you don't know but you are coming out of that furnace Hallelujah you are coming out of that furnace amen you may be wounded but you are not destroyed you are coming out of our life Hallelujah for they say themselves our God is able to deliver us but nevertheless we will not bow to the image God had someone who would serve him and his purpose will not be defeated fire cannot defeat the purpose of and oh how I love to say this this morning oh the hydrogen bombs in the world can never defeat the resurrection of his church all explaining away let them explain away let them explain the word away but all the mathematics and so forth that this intelligent world has disguised through her purpose to do something about to destroy the faith of God's children it will never do it that faith will live on forever Hallelujah that faith will live on forever nothing can take away Faith from the earth mathematics psychology intelligence whatever explanations and reasonings it can never take away Faith do you believe that's a sign cannot be removed let others seek a home below I feel like amen Isaiah 53 ah Hallelujah I have to just close it but there's much I did not say I just read the scripture and there's much more I would have said Isaiah 5335 he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we heed as it were our faces from from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our trans he was breed for our inqu the chastisement of our peace was upon him and will his stri we are healed hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what did the Lord do the law was added because of transgressions the Bible [Music] says till the seed should come to whom the promise was made but also the scripture says Abraham and his SE were the promises made and he says to your seed which is what Christ what was the Seed of Abraham that he had promised it was the it was Christ it was not who the son of Abraham it was not Isaac it was Christ are you following me now I'm trying to find a place to Christ was the sea that would fully possess the G of se he took our place so we could take his place he was wounded for us the law was added because of transgressions now Christ was wounded for our transgression that is why we are no longer under the law and when Jesus came he declared come unto me lebor and a heavy lad I will give you rest so you might be wounded with sickness with sin with heartbreaks disappointments all these things that Paul spoke about in his own life the world may wound us but it cannot destroy because our future is certain with Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah the thing that you are seeking after is already in the deepest box over heaven for youu Christ he was wounded for my transgression and with his stripes I am healed not I'll be healed I am healed it's already made hallelujah hallelujah amen give him a clap of Praise if you believe you may be wounded but not destroyed why because he was wounded for our trans let us on our feet Hallelujah there's a song I want to sing I don't know the song
