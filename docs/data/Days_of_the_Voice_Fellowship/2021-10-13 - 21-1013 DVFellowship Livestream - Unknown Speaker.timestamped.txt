[48:28] [Music]
[48:45] it is not the usual one you knew one
[48:47] golem is ango because they are curses
[48:50] they were the younger
[48:52] ones we wanted me to come here
[48:54] and i may judge them
[49:01] those cases we have specifically for me
[49:03] not for the person to need food because
[49:05] this place
[49:08] this place is uh
[49:14] in
[49:28] who is jesus christ
[49:31] we are the lower judges
[49:34] so that is how god has wished
[49:37] that i may stand before you
[49:40] some of you may not know me
[49:55] may the lord bless you those are and
[49:58] again
[50:00] before we go further we are going to
[50:01] read the scriptures
[50:04] because it is what has brought us
[50:07] we have come to hear from the lord come
[50:09] our favorite praise the lord
[50:37] 10 and verses 18
[50:42] hebrews 10 18.
[50:49] [Music]
[51:06] uh
[51:29] [Music]
[51:33] amen let me read in english
[51:38] where all the holy ghost also is a
[51:42] witness to us
[51:44] for after that he had said before
[51:47] this is the covenant that i will make
[51:50] with them after those days say the lord
[51:54] i will put my laws into their hearts
[51:57] and in their minds will i write them and
[52:00] their sins and iniquities will i
[52:03] remember no more now
[52:06] where remission of this is there is no
[52:09] more offering for sin amen
[52:15] may the lord have a blessing
[52:20] [Music]
[52:24] let us also read in ecclesiastes chapter
[52:27] 3
[52:28] and
[52:29] verses
[52:31] 11.
[52:33] ecclesiastes is after proverbs verse 3
[52:36] chapter 3 verses 11 says
[52:39] then i looked on all the works
[52:42] that my hands had wronged
[52:45] and on the labor that i had labored to
[52:48] do
[52:49] and behold all was vanity and vexation
[52:53] of spirit there was no profit under the
[52:57] sun
[53:30] [Music]
[53:42] [Music]
[54:01] [Music]
[54:29] it says
[54:31] in the blood of covenants covenants is a
[54:34] redemption
[54:35] munda
[54:50] may the lord be blessed
[54:52] because probably
[54:54] we thank the lord
[54:57] for being in this place
[54:59] for this place
[55:02] it is the one who god has chosen to very
[55:04] much
[55:13] at every time god chooses a place eden
[55:17] in heaven while you're eden there was
[55:19] eden no no no school eden and then the
[55:22] kidding of eden
[55:24] eden adam
[55:26] uh no school eden there was adam and the
[55:29] getting of adam
[56:16] [Music]
[57:26] [Music]
[58:19] which could enable man to meet god again
[58:22] yeah take a commander and that price was
[58:25] the lamb
[58:27] the blood once you were muslim under the
[58:29] blood
[58:31] that he may meet man
[58:33] without the blood
[58:44] whatever man can do without blood it is
[58:47] worthless okay
[1:00:21] [Music]
[1:00:39] you lose it and you have it no more
[1:00:54] you are in
[1:01:08] you look at
[1:01:36] message
[1:02:03] that it will reconcile you with god what
[1:02:05] is
[1:02:07] without the reconciliation
[1:02:10] there is death
[1:02:12] hallelujah amen
[1:02:15] do you love him
[1:02:17] hallelujah amen
[1:03:00] the lord
[1:03:42] even his

[1:07:13] university we are prisoners
[1:07:16] of our tv those days we are prisoners of
[1:07:19] sin
[1:07:20] of our christians but today we are
[1:07:21] prisoners of christ
