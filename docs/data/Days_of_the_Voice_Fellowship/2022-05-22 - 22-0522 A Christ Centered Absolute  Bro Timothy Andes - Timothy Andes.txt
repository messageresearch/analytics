all those i imagined the first one and i was given the job uh the job i didn't expect it but uh it's how the lord turns things which seems impossible he makes them possible yeah because this job is would have been for people who are highly educated because uh it's a u.s company that i got a job from as a technical recruiter and uh even that the money or the salary that i were getting the other side uh when we had to compare this one is even much than what i was earning outside so i'm very happy and uh i wouldn't i can't fail to thank god for this miracle it's indeed the miracle and may god

ephraim where where are they where are they let them come also my wife name is the girls yes uh please try to save time now the reason where is agnes against do you see these two families family residents you see the right now there are two churches in ethiopia but these are the people that god used in ethiopia i mean and uh we don't want to we are not lifting up people seeing what we are speaking what really happens uh but the team doesn't always wanted to mention the team yeah we were just long story short when we wanted to start between the car we didn't have chairs situational tv but the team with his own money bought all the chairs for the first challenge and i believe it is not because he had a lot uh in um his house pneumonium by organic at one point he offered me and my wife to even because his house was big it had upstairs and downstairs they with sister lydia offered us to take the ground floor of his house i just wanted them to stand here she really assisted us so much with these little ones they were very small at the time that she has a family now amen and uh children [Music] so this family really stood behind us in the ministry in ethiopia yeah immediately america is amazing and really still does even in our outreaches now and i really want you to thank god for them so they will be leaving shortly but there is a us going to kai mostly we are going to their lo to their church and a lot that could be said one of the ng events of foreground but because we are constrained with the time manga over the touring of turner all right so we will um so we asked the the brethren brother tim's family going back to kenya to send our greetings to the children uh also to our precious pastor potato there and we are so grateful for all that you would keep doing for the lord amen so now uh i'm just reminded actually told now that we there's a baby dedication let's do that right away but we can you know go into the gamble bring their bring their me bring them in from the world of sea bring them in bring them in bring the wandering ones to jesus bring them in bring them bring the [Music] bring them [Music] now you have heard the testimony from sister sister winnie maudi woman jennifer winnie on the same night i was in a car we were in a beam literally a beam he's here where is people come up billy pojango is your hand still bandaged [Music] oh your hand is fine now is it okay yeah with this young man he became sick they were in the overnight service and uh he and another brother brother peter organ not yet here hospital [Music] broken they

jesus name so sweet amen hallelujah [Music] oh yes [Music] [Music] [Music] i want to say god bless you [Music] i didn't come out of any organization but i came with the support of jesus christ many many places there's many many that love your pastor amen amen brother bus is just like me we don't want no organization supporting us because brother branham was the same way that god is called men of god to a backside of the desert experience men that have gone through trials men that don't have it all together [Music] [Music] let's all stand and we're going to turn to the word we're going to sing to be like jesus though immediately if you wanna [Music] because i believe god can speak the same word in softness [Music] lord god but i'm more than that i'm a son of god i have to have my own experience but i pray for your heart that would be here today what [Music] is the pure word of god [Music] and they go out of churches [Music] if you have the desire for god to give you mercy why don't you just lift up your hands why don't you just surrender right now wait wait why don't you say lord speak to me guys lord [Music] [Music] see jesus [Music] [Music] reality [Music] to be like jesus oh on earth i love to be like [Music] from earth i only asked to be [Music] oh man how many have that desire [Music] and this morning let's just hear from our theophany [Music] let's [Music] and then my next pastor was ron peterson peterson and then my next pastor was ed bischo again school and then my next pastor was brother peter ivan and now we have our seventh pastor brother john anderson all of those men will leave the message today praise god so the message and he gave some apostles and prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers to you as a gift i want to say accept the gift accept all that god has for you amen let's continue reading verse 12. why did these ministers come for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ [Music] because ministry is not supposed to preach against people ministries should not uh speak against a circumstance or uh something that's happening in the church until [Music] and of the knowledge of the son of god unto unto [Music] see the problem is when you ask a minister if he makes a mistake in his personal life you notice how hard he'll get hard how hard he will get oh it is i'm going to tell you what that minister is dealing with or any of you are dealing with what you're dealing with any minister that is like that or a person that is like that where they harden their hearts they have pride how many want to be proud of [Music] [Music] when you've received great revelation so this morning we want to speak on our christ-centered absolutely write it down she wondering and come talk to me afterwards so what i took from that under that ministry was that it's important to take notes in church because a lot of people are just listening to the message and they don't even absorb it into their hearts do you want your children to have the life of jesus christ in them a living word that you cannot understand the imbalance is when we make this greater than the bible if you're taking notes this message that i'm going to preach came from 1962. [Music] 12 30 m [Music] and it was called the absolutely see the problem is people preach their own doctrines and brother peter you know where they got their message from google what's the five things denominations are preaching about right now brother tim anders has never gotten a message from the google canada team andy stage [Applause] preaching on another jesus [Music] [Applause] but see people worship their pastors they worship him they make him god if a person tells you it's okay to cut your hair this is the message that brother branham preached ministry today the bride [Music] will we have a big congregation in it never okay because what we have in the message hallelujah i am here to make a message i am here to lift up the message i'm here to lift up jesus see we have an hour we had an hour and a half of music the prophet and we preach the message is not going to churches that are having hundreds of baptisms i'm not going to churches this is a citadel mechanism that are having hundreds of people baptized now listen very carefully baptism is an important and i said where are the people you baptized [Music] we're having this huge sweeping revival in uganda they want to take and that's to give all glory to jesus christ amen amen hallelujah just like a brother timothy could stand here when it seems brother bus is lifting him up brother is not lifting up him he's lifting up timothy we're lifting up jesus in the brothers [Music] is if we compromise on the word of god only the true believer will stay from this brother gave a testimony that god provided a job what if this brother though in his hour of need had texted me and 15 other americans then he would have replaced jehovah jireh our young god gave him a greater job you need to stop must be set by god if you're cheating on your wife [Music] if i [Music] prophet so brother joseph is part of the faithful ministry brothers [Music] but have somewhere that you go to church somewhere you support the but don't never disfellowship the [Applause] that is causing disunity what do i need to do brother jim if i have hey repent it's done we're winning it when you repent we're winning but you might have to email them now and when that how many believe this is there absolutely and see if he has the same purpose in his heart you got fellowship one with another we're not women when when will you have that fellowship when you discern his spirits when brother tim sits over here and i listen to a minister when brother tim sits over there oh look on the team but nevertheless and i listened to a minister or anywhere in the church i it i'm looking at his spirit i'm looking at what his motive and objective bus oh my foreign on the bus not because i think he has a great ministry not because i think he's a special man i came because the spirit in me is the same thing [Applause] has been crucified by people that somebody's got something against somebody 104. and bring it back he should be able to bring an argument back into sweetness he knows how to take care of things if they can't did you know that there is a big movement in the message of the hour oh my god that tithes from people that don't go to your church you're a hypocrite do you to go as brother understand said to the local minister to the local church that you go in you know what's happening right now what does never changed when they started streaming service instead of two on saturday do you understand what's like hypocrite liars taking the word of god and taking advantage christ to be blessed you must be given to hospitals why do people believe it they can just drink wine you just disqualified yourself [Music] i don't [Music] and you know what i'm lowering myself too oh when don't stop go and look at thursday night at cloverdale by the way makes an announcement that a chinese sister is translating the service and he says something very profound you can do that so where in the message do we get it that men can only translate a lady is greater than a man my prophet said my wife is greater than me my wife is who i am if you doormat your wife if you can't wash the dishes with your wife well that's someone of course with your wife you are not ready for the rapture because the pride is getting herself ready and her husband is coming down i don't want to be working and saying i want to walk with you i want to talk with you i want to have fellowship you want harmony in your home if you want harmony in your home why don't you just try let's talk it's not cool sing wife sit down here's some ice cream you relax and i'll wash [Music] this is a hard thing he said when his wife slammed [Music] people have asked the question how long should a sister wear a skirt [Applause] i saw the pastor's wife with a big split what yourself with a man i don't care [Applause] message his can you please raise your hand someone in here that has never had a disagreement or argument with [Applause] see i know i just heard more sister see man than brother [Applause] women's we now have a vice president that's a woman amen fulfilling the prophecy the fifth the fifth vision are not bad that you should be [Music] [Music] a they formed uh they formed uh a group against me [Music] they made a document against now listen to the service if you can't forgive someone you won't be forgiven hey the problem is the longer you're in the message the greater chance an entitlement spirit can rise yes entitlement spirit you're entitled as the only group okay the men that make themselves special are a denomination i was in many churches as i said he was not your husband [Music] do you know why the rapture hasn't happened yet to test you if you'll continue loving jesus you know why the rapture didn't happen in 1977 her children need to look at her mommy and see jesus yeah but their children need to look at their mommy when i talk about sister rebecca i'm talking about the bride when you're gonna talk the pastor or minister must not bring division [Music] first corinthians chapter 1 you're all invited to come to bear the gideons and we're going to preach there at 3 00 or 3 30 continue the unity of the faith by the name of our lord jesus christ that all of you be in full agreement in what you say and that there be no divisions [Music] 60 70 years old why are men not letting young men preach there's one reason because brother in the back in the wife no man despised oh thank you jesus yes women i'm thankful for a grammar that believes the message i mean myself she transcribed the message i didn't get it brother she transcribed the message my grandma wang my grandpa for 36 years edited and made the message this little tiny piece of paper and now they have congregations that are thousands [Music] when you witness you're trying to get them to your church don't think you need prayer from your pastors [Applause] original faith close zakat god wants to be personal to you today who wants to serve of god two thousand years ago the way that god is god when did you last listen to the message [Music] you say you're ministers of the gospel but you go and talk to five ministers and get their thoughts i'm only 29 years old but i have a revelation [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to our apps have a christ-centered life help us god not to listen to others opinions but help us to take your thoughts [Music] of all that [Music] [Music] [Applause] in their life right now [Music] obviously makeup have mercy on them jesus our sisters that we're sexual clothes man forgive them i send you away forgive our brothers that talk [Music] you are the same [Music] what did you see in 1963 i saw jesus [Music] how many see jesus in the message how many say lord forgive me of my day may i not be in the message a rich young ruler right now i want you to pray for your friend i want you to pray for your unsaved [Music] [Music] right now [Music] you want to be a sweet young lady [Music] [Music] [Music] that's who i am [Music] [Music] [Music] i mean [Music] when we praise god hallelujah means praise prophet said in africa hallelujah means the same thing is that right amen hallelujah amen so we might speak different languages we have a language that is the same it's a heavenly language [Music] [Music] [Music] lord we thank you and lord we thank you lord [Music] hallelujah [Music] i love

me the lord of glory no one else can talk my heart [Music] [Music] oh there is [Music] one else [Music] [Music] see [Music] [Music] foreign like [Music] there is more time there is [Music] like you don't [Music] [Music] there is none like hallelujah before we leave this place today [Music] what's the condition of your heart [Music] you see sometimes the lord takes the minister through situations get into a condition [Music] that the word of god today has not gone in pain i believe there is someone here is there another one too who needed to hear exactly that uh that thing that should not change [Music] read the whole service but then you find a testimony afterwards someone comes says that service is liberated what it did and let him speak to you are you kidding us loving jesus yes we come before you this morning this afternoon two james you'll get to truly because we are grateful because of your life the scripture tells us what you took in john 3 16. and where is your son today
