[1:33:09] but this service is meant to encourage
[1:33:15] I may be in that Valley this morning
[1:33:19] but listen to me now he believes the
[1:33:22] spirit of God is here this morning
[1:33:29] he can never come in your life and you
[1:33:32] remain the same
[1:33:37] and the spirit of the Lord carried
[1:33:38] Ezekiel and took him in a valley full of
[1:33:40] dry bones
[1:33:42] [Music]
[1:33:44] him to pass by them around above
[1:33:48] and behold there were very many in the
[1:33:50] open valleys
[1:34:01] and here this scripture read it one time
[1:34:06] as a pastor in Ethiopia that little
[1:34:08] church starting up
[1:34:11] and this sister was going through she
[1:34:15] had gone a lot of through a lot of
[1:34:17] problems in her life
[1:34:20] and since she believed the message it
[1:34:22] seemed as if God was not working for her
[1:34:26] she was going through a lot of trouble
[1:34:30] you know Financial constraints
[1:34:33] problems on every side
[1:34:37] came to me in the office
[1:34:40] crying
[1:34:42] I was a young Pastor I did not know what
[1:34:46] to do in such instances
[1:35:07] but you see what would help if the
[1:35:10] spirit of the Lord came in the room
[1:35:12] when the spirit of Lord comes in your
[1:35:14] life he makes a difference
[1:35:17] at that very moment
[1:35:20] I closed my I was sitting back in my
[1:35:22] chair and she was messy all over there
[1:35:25] the other side of the of the bench
[1:35:29] I just sat back and I closed my eyes
[1:35:32] because I was trying to feel where she
[1:35:35] was going on
[1:35:37] I was trying to relate to what with what
[1:35:39] she's going through
[1:35:41] that very moment the spirit of the Lord
[1:35:44] came in the room she said you were never
[1:35:47] the spirit of the Lord comes in the room
[1:35:50] something is bound to happen
[1:35:53] something always happens
[1:35:57] a living God
[1:36:01] not a god of doctrines only
[1:36:05] he's a God that comes out from the pages
[1:36:07] of the Bible
[1:36:10] comes into reality
[1:36:14] he manifest his presence
[1:36:17] for sure and again he is not just a more
[1:36:20] that we are worshiping
[1:36:25] he's a living God
[1:36:28] and at that moment I experience this
[1:36:32] power
[1:36:33] began to carry me
[1:36:35] up in the dreams of Revelation
[1:36:39] and you know things began to open up
[1:36:42] this scripture came in my mind
[1:36:46] I said it I didn't even know I I don't
[1:36:48] remember I had not rehearsed it against
[1:36:51] it but I I told her sister
[1:36:53] the word of God says
[1:37:05] but you see my sister
[1:37:08] he is asking you this question
[1:37:12] can these bones live again
[1:37:17] I said why did God
[1:37:24] the God where the bones can live again
[1:37:27] or not Obama again
[1:37:30] but why did he ask as a kid
[1:37:34] because he wanted to know
[1:38:02] [Music]
[1:38:29] he wants you to be involved in the
[1:38:31] Miracles
[1:38:33] in the miracle of the transformation of
[1:38:36] Our Lives Allah
[1:38:57] don't just lay there
[1:39:03] anointed
[1:39:13] here is the situation of your life
[1:39:16] what do you say
[1:39:19] not what God says
[1:39:25] would you remain like that
[1:39:27] how can God move you and do something
[1:39:30] new in your life
[1:39:35] and Ezekiel was lying there as a kid
[1:39:37] yeah you know that reminds me what
[1:39:39] happened with Moses
[1:39:56] Moses why do you cry
[1:40:02] there is a lot more in you than you know
[1:40:06] your mind that's why a Believer must
[1:40:08] never speak either word
[1:40:12] that's why I do not always like jesting
[1:40:15] and laughing about things
[1:40:20] whether I'm going through a bad
[1:40:22] situation
[1:40:23] I always say I am rich
[1:40:26] and actually even in real life many
[1:40:29] people think I have a lot more than what
[1:40:30] I really have in animals
[1:40:34] whatever I prophesy in my life it
[1:40:36] happens
[1:40:40] foreign
[1:41:07] [Music]
[1:41:09] let me tell you we need to learn to
[1:41:11] speak to the storms
[1:41:17] the scripture says yes and life are in
[1:41:21] the power of the past
[1:41:27] tell your name is amen
[1:41:36] it's not the time is the confession of
[1:41:39] the past
[1:41:41] and it's not a tongue that will do it
[1:41:44] because it is the spirit of the Lord
[1:41:46] which is going to come and follow the
[1:41:49] words of a Believer
[1:41:52] and he will make sure
[1:42:01] and here you know there's power
[1:42:07] and as I began to speak to that sister I
[1:42:11] spoke to her and said what do you say
[1:42:13] about the situation why do you cry can
[1:42:18] you live again
[1:42:19] God restore you talk to your glory
[1:42:24] all this money that is lost
[1:42:26] all this business and minimize all your
[1:42:29] life that you've lost
[1:42:34] my sister what do you say Laguna
[1:42:52] prophesy to the bones
[1:42:55] hallelujah amen
[1:42:57] prophesied these bones
[1:43:09] then saith the Lord thus saith the Lord
[1:43:12] God unto this born
[1:43:17] regular
[1:43:19] [Music]
[1:44:03] it God followed those who were cartoon
[1:44:06] baby
[1:44:10] and the first time he prophesied
[1:44:12] that was a noise
[1:44:16] and the bones came together
[1:44:20] everything was not yet perfect because
[1:44:23] there was no life
[1:44:29] and all the same news
[1:44:31] they also developed the flesh Came Upon
[1:44:35] him
[1:44:37] let me tell you my brother my sister

[2:42:32] custard Devils Museum
[2:42:40] except the Believers
[2:42:44] in my name those who believe
[2:42:48] us here
[2:42:51] now you must cast out the voice
[2:42:54] you should speak in New Times

[2:43:00] it and you convert it
[2:43:04] oh Lord come on you go in prayer one day
[2:43:08] I just want to see
[2:43:11] the spirit
[2:43:16] and when you begin to speak several
[2:43:18] times
[2:43:23] because with your tongue has power bank
[2:43:26] because your tongue has the message
[2:43:29] you are not speaking presumptuously
[2:43:32] but you are speaking by revelation
[2:43:39] of what God has done
[2:43:43] speaking presumptuously
[2:43:47] Ezekiel was speaking by revelations
[2:43:55] it was inspiration Hallelujah
[2:44:02] foreign
[2:44:49] became a nation again yeah
[2:44:58] the Jews are not loved by many people in
[2:45:00] the world
[2:45:04] but everybody in the world recognizes
[2:45:08] that the Jews are not alone
[2:45:14] you're not alone
[2:45:17] they are not alone
[2:45:23] because it's proved it over and over
[2:45:27] Israel is one of the smallest nations in
[2:45:30] the world
[2:45:33] but the IDF
[2:45:35] IDF which is the Israel Defense Forces
[2:45:40] is one of the greatest
[2:45:43] military formations in the world
[2:45:48] they've accomplished missions that even
[2:45:52] have left America
[2:45:57] the IDF IDF one of their missions
[2:46:01] was right here
[2:46:04] Uganda in our country but Germany Uganda
[2:46:06] is that right
[2:46:08] our great superpower
[2:46:12] I mean I mean
[2:46:17] of the Empire
[2:46:22] the man who made the
[2:46:25] British or Massachusetts
[2:46:31] they indeed did
[2:46:34] they say
[2:46:36] whether by force
[2:46:42] and he was feared across Africa
[2:46:47] when he captured a plane
[2:46:50] of Israelis
[2:46:55] Uganda the way they came for their
[2:46:57] people
[2:47:00] the man was shot um
[2:47:04] when you know if those of you who've
[2:47:07] never watched that that skid or that
[2:47:09] movie go and watch it
[2:47:14] what is it called
[2:47:17] operation Thunderbolt Thunderbird
[2:47:20] operation Thunderbolt go and watch it it
[2:47:24] was one of the greatest operations
[2:47:32] without our others detecting them
[2:47:38] and they took their people
[2:47:39] before I mean
[2:47:42] would realize
[2:47:48] praise the name of the Lord one of the
[2:47:51] greatest
[2:47:52] operations
[2:47:55] and that's not the only one they have
[2:47:58] done many operations
[2:48:01] this one they did in um I don't know how
[2:48:04] they call it the country um
[2:48:07] one of the Arab Nations
[2:48:09] nation that wanted to
[2:48:11] um
[2:48:13] yes somebody knows it
[2:48:15] no
[2:48:16] that wanted to do a a nuclear bomb what
[2:48:20] yes
[2:48:21] Iran yes Iran
[2:48:24] they wanted to make it
[2:48:27] Iran Iran is actually what we see here
[2:48:31] in the Bible
[2:48:33] and they have always wanted to inhalate
[2:48:37] and highlight Israel Buddhism
[2:48:43] and so their purpose was actually
[2:48:47] to remove Israel from the mouth
[2:48:50] but the way IDF infiltrated
[2:49:01] and it's not the beginning if you
[2:49:03] believe in the Bible and you take this
[2:49:04] Bible is the Bible you know this summer
[2:49:06] you will find many operations
[2:49:10] but you will always find it in their
[2:49:13] operation why they were able to pull it
[2:49:14] off
[2:49:17] why they were able to pull it offer to
[2:49:19] be successful is
[2:49:21] because there was always another General
[2:49:24] behind them
[2:49:25] is
[2:49:31] God himself for the Bible says is the
[2:49:35] Mighty God
