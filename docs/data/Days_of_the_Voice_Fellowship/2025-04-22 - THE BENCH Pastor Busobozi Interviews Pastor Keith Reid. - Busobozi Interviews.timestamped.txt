[11:35] greetings our listeners and those who
[11:37] are watching us. Welcome to another
[11:39] episode of the bench. I'm Pastor as
[11:42] usual and today I'm honored and we are
[11:45] honored to host a very special guest. Uh
[11:47] Pastor Keith Reed all the way from
[11:50] Jamaica. Pastor Keith is a seasoned
[11:52] minister of the end time message and
[11:55] also is a what would call a successful
[11:58] businessman working with multinational
[12:00] corporation and we are blessed to have
[12:03] him here to bless our young
[12:05] generation and I would like to say
[12:07] welcome to the program sir. Thank you
[12:09] very much and it's a pleasure being here
[12:13] and being here with you all. Uh for
[12:16] those watching who may not know you and
[12:19] uh please if you could tell us about
[12:21] yourself maybe your back a little bit
[12:22] about your background and how you came
[12:24] to the faith to the the message and your
[12:27] current work in ministry and maybe a
[12:30] little bit about what you're doing.
[12:32] Okay. Um I'm Keith Reed. I'm from
[12:35] Jamaica. Um my
[12:38] coming to the message. Um, the first
[12:40] time when I heard the message was about
[12:43] 1980. I was still in high school. Um,
[12:47] apparently my former pastor, Pastor
[12:50] Thomas Brady, who many have known
[12:53] personally, um, his son was a classmate
[12:56] of mine and actually we we got very
[13:00] close to together. He invited me to
[13:03] their home church in Discover Bay,
[13:05] Saintan. Now, if you know Jamaica or
[13:08] even look at Jamaica in the map. Um
[13:11] they're from the northern coast. I'm
[13:13] from the central area of the island. So
[13:16] they actually are on the northern coast
[13:18] with the tourism, the nice beaches and
[13:20] hotels and all of that. So it was my
[13:22] pleasure to go to discover ban and to
[13:26] meet his dad, brother Thomas Brady. I
[13:29] think at that time they had visitors,
[13:32] brother Dan Dasley, brother Henry Green
[13:34] and um so from them I heard the message
[13:38] for the very first time. Um, we were
[13:42] actually still in high school and but I
[13:44] never get converted to the message until
[13:47] after high school I was really converted
[13:50] to it. So I was aware of the message. I
[13:54] grew up as a Baptist but it was after
[13:56] high school that I really had that call
[13:59] from God to be baptized and to follow
[14:02] the message of the hour.
[14:04] So, how many years have you been in the
[14:06] message? Well, actually, so I came
[14:09] around the message 19 um 80. I was
[14:12] baptized
[14:14] 1985 and um I've been pastoring actually
[14:18] this year is going to make 30 years of
[14:21] pastoring a group of people in the
[14:24] message. Amen. We are blessed to have
[14:26] you on this program because
[14:29] um it's um meant to bless the young
[14:32] generation or the next generation if you
[14:35] you will um just to for them to be able
[14:38] to know how others did it in many
[14:40] perspectives in ministry in in in work
[14:43] in you know just to encourage the young
[14:45] people in the message. So we are really
[14:47] honored to have you.
[14:49] Uh so before we continue um we want to
[14:52] honor a very close uh pastor um uh
[14:57] someone who is very close to your heart
[14:59] brother Brady you mentioned him in your
[15:01] introduction a Jamaican message pioneer
[15:04] uh who had a professional encounter with
[15:06] um uh rather a personal encounter with
[15:08] brother Brham uh of course many of you
[15:11] listening in I'm sure that you are
[15:13] message believers and brother Bernham is
[15:16] um you know close to your heart being a
[15:19] prophet. So, let's take a moment to
[15:22] watch this powerful clip. Um, we just
[15:24] took out a little bit of a a clip from
[15:27] the message of the hour in in one of the
[15:29] messages of brother Brady being designed
[15:31] in brother Banam's meetings. If uh
[15:34] brother Isaac, you could please play
[15:36] that clip for us.
[15:49] There's a colored man sitting way back
[15:52] here. Got a burden on his heart as far
[15:55] his
[15:57] wife. She's not here even. She's got
[16:01] trouble with her
[16:04] feet. You believe in healer? You
[16:09] do? You're a stranger here.
[16:12] You're from across the sea. You're from
[16:15] Jamaica.
[16:18] You believe God can tell me who you are,
[16:20] Mr. Brady.
[16:23] You believe Jesus Christ is the same
[16:26] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen.
[16:31] This Okay. Sorry, I couldn't have
[16:33] feedback here. So, but I'm I'm sure
[16:35] those of you who are listening have been
[16:37] following. Now, you've heard uh what
[16:39] brother Bham said. uh when I heard that
[16:42] the first time brother Keith
[16:45] uh it was years ago and of course you
[16:49] you we hear very many people being
[16:50] designed in the meetings of brother Bham
[16:53] I personally have been designed in the
[16:55] meeting of brother Banham I'm sure that
[16:57] comes across as a surprise because I'm
[16:59] 34 years old and brother Bham has not
[17:02] has been off the scene for over 50 years
[17:05] but I I would share this little
[17:07] testimony maybe for our viewers and for
[17:09] you to understand that this is very
[17:11] personal to me. Um, many years ago, uh,
[17:14] I had just been new to the message and I
[17:17] was in my in my room, um, closed in. I
[17:20] was all by myself and, um, I had a
[17:24] terrible stomach trouble and also other
[17:27] issues and I had many other confusions
[17:29] in my life at the time and I really
[17:31] needed God to come through to me and to
[17:33] minister to me. So I I had put it on uh
[17:36] put on a tape of brother Bham and while
[17:38] it was uh playing and at the end I
[17:41] usually love those designments. So at
[17:42] the end I prayed an impossible prayer. I
[17:45] usually call it an impossible prayer. I
[17:46] said God if you are the one that sent
[17:48] this prophet to our generation not the
[17:51] generation before us but our
[17:53] generation. Use him to also speak
[17:56] directly to me to my situation. I I just
[17:59] somehow believed in the impossible that
[18:01] God was able to do something. maybe turn
[18:03] that voice just to minister to me. So it
[18:06] was at that moment that you know brother
[18:08] Banamander a few people and then he came
[18:10] to this woman then left the woman then
[18:12] came to this man I always believed I was
[18:14] the next I was the next and then when he
[18:16] came to this gentleman he said come here
[18:18] sir and then he said you are a brother
[18:21] said you are a minister of the gospel
[18:23] and then he said um you have stomach
[18:26] trouble you don't know what went through
[18:28] me it was just like an electricity from
[18:30] the crown of my head to the sole of my
[18:31] feet I felt that God was ministering to
[18:34] me directly He said, "You have stomach
[18:36] trouble." And then he began to speak
[18:37] what had caused
[18:38] it. And everything was personal to me. I
[18:43] was moved. I was touched. And it made me
[18:46] understand that brother Bham was a
[18:48] prophet to our generation. I had already
[18:49] believed it, but then now it had become
[18:51] personal to me because I prayed a prayer
[18:53] and God answered it. Amen. So, Brother
[18:55] Isaac just played for us a clip out of
[18:57] Brother Banham's meetings where um a
[19:01] man, Brother Bry, was uh there
[19:05] physically in the meetings of Brother
[19:07] Bam in um in the US having come from
[19:11] Jamaica. Uh Pastor Keith, if I may ask,
[19:14] what did Brother Breed mean to you
[19:16] personally and how did his life and
[19:18] ministry impact your walk with Christ?
[19:20] And maybe if you could give some
[19:22] perspective on I know that you you knew
[19:24] him personally, he was your pastor and
[19:27] how he came to uh you know come to these
[19:29] meetings. I know I met you personally
[19:31] and you shared this with me. I I was
[19:32] just so amazed. Um, you know, brother
[19:35] Brady, if you have ever known him, you
[19:38] know the testimony of his life. And he
[19:42] would have shared really first of all
[19:45] being converted as a young person out of
[19:48] church of God, being baptized in the
[19:50] name of the father, son, and holy ghost.
[19:53] Well, the first time when he came across
[19:55] brethren from the USA, and I think that
[19:58] brother's name was brother Halbert
[20:00] Green, he preached to them the baptism
[20:04] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[20:06] the book of Acts. And that was really
[20:08] what brought him to come to that
[20:11] position really because never before had
[20:14] they read that or hear of that in their
[20:18] home church in Jamaica. So he said
[20:21] initially them as young persons they
[20:23] thought that was something in the white
[20:25] man's book and it wasn't generally in
[20:28] their book but he said he took note of
[20:31] the scriptures that were used and when
[20:34] he read it for himself he realized ah
[20:37] this is really the word of God and so he
[20:41] was baptized in the name of the Lord
[20:43] Jesus and by was that in the US? No he
[20:47] was baptized back in Jamaica. Back in
[20:48] Jamaica. So on were there other
[20:50] believers at the time? Oh yes, there
[20:51] were other brothers and and I think that
[20:54] there was about three brothers that were
[20:56] baptized from the church and uh I mean
[20:59] as it would have been being baptized in
[21:01] the name of the Lord Jesus in a
[21:03] trinitarian church, there were actually
[21:06] this fellowship from the church. And you
[21:09] know it speaks of the life of many who
[21:12] when you believe the Bible and begin to
[21:15] take practice
[21:16] of
[21:30] audience specifically tell them their
[21:34] name, tell them what their condition was
[21:37] and all of that.
[21:39] Now, brother Brady said on this visit to
[21:42] the USA, um his wife was
[21:50] pregnant. Tell them fill the water pot.
[21:53] The the water was converted to wine
[21:57] miraculously. That was Jesus. The first
[22:00] manifestation of Jesus that we saw. But
[22:03] when Jesus met the woman of Samaria, it
[22:06] was another kind of ministry. Mhm. Here
[22:08] was this man speaking to this woman.
[22:11] This man could even tell the time
[22:14] spiritually that we were living in. The
[22:17] woman said, "Our fathers worship in the
[22:20] mountain." And they said that Jerusalem
[22:22] is a place where men are to worship.
[22:24] Jesus tell her, "Woman, the hour cometh
[22:28] and this is the hour." What kind of man
[22:31] is this that could declare the very hour
[22:34] when God would move from
[22:38] And 28 is a sign of life. On July uh on
[22:44] July 28th, 1963, brother Brandham
[22:47] preached Christ, the mystery of God
[22:51] revealed. And in that we see that the
[22:55] mighty God who had left 2,000 years ago
[22:59] was made plain by revelation to us
[23:02] because the ministry is not for brother
[23:05] Brham. The message is not to tell about
[23:08] a prophet. The message is to reveal
[23:11] Jesus Christ to the modern world. Amen.
[23:15] And that's what he did when he preached
[23:17] Christ the mystery of God revealed. He
[23:19] preached the seventh seal. That is Jesus
[23:22] Christ is here again in word form which
[23:25] is Revelation 10:1. Yeah. Which is
[23:28] Revelation 8:1. The mighty angel has
[23:32] come down and he's with us. Jesus Christ
[23:35] is here again in word form. Amen. Amen.
[23:38] And you notice that many especially the
[23:40] evangelicals and the charismatics you
[23:42] know they received brother Bernham uh in
[23:44] the first phase of his
[24:14] and ministry journey. How did you come
[24:17] to uh personally receive the message
[24:19] yourself? And I know you've talked about
[24:20] that. Maybe if you want to expound on
[24:22] that and when did you did you receive a
[24:24] call? Maybe this second segment. You may
[24:26] want to talk a little bit more about it.
[24:29] How you receive the call to preach and
[24:31] how did it come clear to you that you
[24:33] were a preacher? we've already had
[24:38] that I could have the best income. That
[24:41] was really my
[24:42] intention. But it was while I was at
[24:45] Nestle, I used to sit and talk to, you
[24:47] know, Christians that were elders
[24:49] really. And I remember one concern I
[24:52] had, you know, I never came up in an
[24:55] apostolic church. The book of Acts, I
[24:57] did not have a great grasp on it really
[25:00] because I grew up in the Baptist church.
[25:02] But I remember I was in a dream I could
[25:06] say one night because I had this great
[25:09] burden on my heart and I see like there
[25:12] was weed just blowing in the wind
[25:15] blowing and the wind was of such force
[25:18] that it almost moved me from where I was
[25:21] in that dream or that vision and a voice
[25:24] spoke to me and and says you know go you
[25:28] know go all that you have is enough and
[25:33] brother that has been a mark on my life
[25:36] for ministry. It is enough. And um you
[25:41] know I started preaching and in my early
[25:43] years of preaching as a young man 23
[25:46] years old well I well I started before
[25:48] 23 but starting preaching really in the
[25:51] factory that I work you know we sit as
[25:53] Christians nominal Christians and we
[25:56] talk about the word of God. People begin
[25:57] to invite me to their church and I
[25:59] preach I preach as an evangelist at that
[26:03] time. But I say this to all young people
[26:07] and young men who have a desire to
[26:10] preach the gospel. The church age book
[26:14] is a book that when I read that book in
[26:17] its entirety, it changed my ministry all
[26:21] together. Praise the Lord. Because
[26:24] doctrine of the Bible becomes clearer.
[26:29] It's a book. It is easy to read. It
[26:32] gives a brief history. It give present
[26:35] tense and it gives you uh an hold an
[26:40] understanding of scriptural truth. So
[26:45] now you have a greater understanding of
[26:48] why do we baptize in Jesus name the
[26:51] godhead is Jesus Christ God the Sabbath
[26:56] should we keep the seventh day Sabbath?
[26:59] It shows you the true Sabbath from the
[27:02] scripture that when you receive the Holy
[27:04] Ghost, you receive your Sabbath rest.
[27:08] And so, as you know, Israel had a rest
[27:11] of the seventh day. When we come into
[27:14] the Holy Ghost, we receive not a seventh
[27:17] day rest, but we receive an eternal rest
[27:20] in the Holy Ghost from our whole works.
[27:23] So all that doctrine that we require,
[27:27] you know, to to move forward in the
[27:29] gospel, it is in that church book. And
[27:32] so I said to all young people, read the
[27:35] book. Give attendance to reading because
[27:38] reading makes a full man. Amen. And
[27:42] we'll talk more about that. But now, uh,
[27:44] you you make reference to the church age
[27:47] book. Um, there's a portion that I've
[27:49] always ministered to to the young
[27:51] people. uh from the Ephesian church age
[27:54] and I just quote
[27:56] this ministering speaking of uh of Paul
[27:59] the first um messenger to the first
[28:01] church age. He says his man of
[28:03] ministering set the pattern that all
[28:05] future messengers were to aspire to and
[28:07] and actually sets the pattern for every
[28:10] true minister of God. though he would
[28:12] not attain such heights in the prophetic
[28:14] reum as did Paul's ministry had a
[28:16] three-fold quality and then he gives the
[28:18] three-fold quality of Paul's ministry
[28:20] and one of them was he was absolutely
[28:23] true to the word which we have actually
[28:25] heard you testify to and he also said he
[28:27] was you know not organized but we were
[28:29] spiritled he also said that um you know
[28:31] he he had a demonstration of the power
[28:35] of the of of God you know the power of
[28:37] the spirit was um and then the fruit of
[28:39] his ministry So, uh, if I may ask, you
[28:43] know, you've preached around the world
[28:45] and, you know, uh, I had never met you
[28:47] until I met you here in Uganda, but I've
[28:49] always seen your name. Your name has
[28:50] been, um, uh, common to most of our
[28:54] eyes. So, you preach around the world
[28:56] and could you share some of those most
[28:59] unforgettful
[29:01] moments, testimonies from your ministry?
[29:04] You see this sparks of those especially
[29:07] younger ministers that are into ministry
[29:08] to know it's not only the letter there
[29:12] must also be that man that part of the
[29:14] manifestation as much as we do not dwell
[29:16] on on that and focus on that we focus on
[29:18] preaching the word but God has to come
[29:19] around and vindicate that what you're
[29:21] preaching is the truth. Amen. Amen.
[29:23] Amen. You
[29:25] see, we are taught that with a
[29:28] restoration of the word, there's also a
[29:31] restoration of the power of the word.
[29:35] And like the messenger to the church of
[29:36] Ephesus, Paul, as you quote him just a
[29:40] while ago, Paul says, "For the word
[29:42] comes not in word only, but in power and
[29:46] manifestation of the Holy Spirit." Now
[29:49] in crescendum you see out there today on
[29:52] display they're trying not to preach the
[29:56] word of God to the people but try to
[29:58] give the people an attraction of the
[30:01] manifestation. Now gifts are always
[30:03] going to be in the church. Yes. But it's
[30:05] not the gifts that save you. The word is
[30:08] Christ. And once we focus on the word,
[30:12] now the Bible says um wherever the word
[30:16] is, the gifts will follow. You know, cuz
[30:19] gifts will follow the believer. These
[30:21] signs shall follow the believer. But in
[30:24] in St. Matthew 12, the Bible says, "An
[30:27] evil and adulterous generation seeketh
[30:29] after a sign, and no sign will be given
[30:31] unto them but the sign of the prophet
[30:34] Jonah." Now the pro the sign of Jonah is
[30:36] a sign of the resurrection which is a
[30:40] resurrection of the word of God in you
[30:43] the restoration of the word and with
[30:45] that will come actually the the all the
[30:49] gifts of the spirit. Yeah. Now I mean
[30:52] I've I've been through South Africa,
[30:53] Zimbabwe, Nigeria, uh you know Ghana,
[30:57] I've been to Kenya, Uganda, so on
[31:00] Liberia and I've been to Canada, US,
[31:03] Trinidad. I've been many places really
[31:05] and um I personally my focus first of
[31:10] all first and foremost is to for people
[31:13] to receive the word of God. God can heal
[31:16] a sinner but he's still a sinner. But
[31:20] God sent his word to heal us really. And
[31:23] God does not adopt the devil's children.
[31:27] All the gifts of the spirit and the
[31:29] redemptive blessing is for the believer.
[31:31] Yeah. So the word would catch the
[31:34] believer in let me speak of Uganda here.
[31:38] Um one of the first miracles I've seen
[31:41] in Uganda is in Buzza if I call the name
[31:45] right. Um I was with pastor Otette and
[31:49] um I was at his house and he tell me he
[31:51] wants me to pray for a little girl and
[31:54] we we went through the village. We came
[31:56] to this house of this little girl. Now
[31:59] as I reached there I saw this young girl
[32:03] you know she was covered uh over under a
[32:06] sheet and she was just groaning like
[32:09] that groan of debt this girl you know
[32:11] she was in pain you know she could
[32:13] hardly breathe but she was groaning so
[32:16] they the somebody came and they were
[32:19] relating the case to us really said what
[32:21] happened to her how old is she's 15
[32:24] years old and they said two weeks ago
[32:28] her sister had died from the same
[32:31] sickness. And once her sister died, she
[32:34] had a dream that the demons are going to
[32:37] take her life. She's next. And I was
[32:40] moved with compassion. So I went across,
[32:44] I sit by her head and I said, "Lord
[32:47] Jesus, if you were here, you would have
[32:50] raised up this child in the name of
[32:53] Jesus Christ. Satan, get out of her. And
[32:57] listen, that groaning stopped. That
[33:01] little girl pushed that cover from off
[33:03] her and she sat up in the seat. Amen. I
[33:07] mean, it was so amazing to everybody
[33:10] around. Somebody went and called her
[33:13] mother and I there sitting down the
[33:16] brother speaking. I was really communing
[33:19] with God and I saw the vision that the
[33:22] mother would have come. And so when she
[33:24] came through the door, I asked her
[33:26] directly because I'd seen it. I said,
[33:29] "Why are the demons trying to kill your
[33:32] children?" And she began to relate to me
[33:35] that her husband had another woman and
[33:38] he had sent demons to kill all of her
[33:39] seven children. And I was telling her by
[33:42] faith believing in Jesus Christ, the
[33:46] faith of Jesus. I told her, I said, "No
[33:48] more of your children will die." And I
[33:50] witnessed to her Jesus Christ. And she
[33:53] fall on her knee and repented before
[33:55] Jesus Christ. Amen. And she and her
[33:58] daughter gave their life to Jesus. And
[34:01] that weekend they were baptized in the
[34:03] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. on my
[34:05] first trip here in Uganda, they followed
[34:08] me as far as uh you know as I traveled
[34:12] and preach on the eastern region, you
[34:15] know, they followed me and they preached
[34:17] when I was at brother Simeo's church. Um
[34:20] they followed me. They were they
[34:22] actually had to have a separate
[34:24] interpreter because they did not speak
[34:26] the common language based on where they
[34:28] were far from. But you know the people
[34:31] saw not only the word but they saw the
[34:36] gift of God following the word of God. M
[34:39] and on my second trip December of 2019
[34:44] um uh Pastor Gideon took me to um Fortal
[34:49] where we had a convention in a secondary
[34:51] school and I must say really
[34:55] of all the conventions that I've
[34:57] preached over the world I've seen the
[35:00] power of God manifest in that convention
[35:02] more than I've seen it anywhere else and
[35:06] in that convention we never the
[35:09] ministers. We never laid on on anybody
[35:12] but just the going forth of the word
[35:15] that God is here again in the power of
[35:18] his resurrection and many people were
[35:21] healed and testify of their healing
[35:24] really. Yeah. You know the things that
[35:26] God did there was more than my eyes have
[35:29] seen in my many years of ministry. you
[35:32] know and you know the third time I came
[35:34] to Uganda they tell me you are you you
[35:38] were invited back because of what
[35:41] happened in the meeting in Fort Poral so
[35:44] I've seen the power of God in this place
[35:46] in this country really and my heart is
[35:50] being drawn to Uganda I love the people
[35:53] of Uganda because I've seen their
[35:55] faithfulness in the word and the hunger
[35:58] for the word of God in Jamaica I've seen
[36:01] in people just by the preaching of the
[36:04] word some are being called out the word
[36:08] of wisdom you know um we've heard the
[36:11] story of atite I can remember preaching
[36:15] back home and a sister she just
[36:18] confirmed the word brother Keith that's
[36:20] nothing but the truth and the
[36:22] inspiration struck me her name is sister
[36:24] Ma Dixon she was one of the first ones
[36:27] when I took the message into Lindstead
[36:29] Jamaica and The inspiration struck me
[36:32] and I said to her, I said, "Sister,
[36:34] because you have agreed with God word,
[36:37] tell your son Joseph that the job that
[36:40] he was going after, tomorrow is going to
[36:43] have the confirmation of that job." That
[36:45] young man was not in church. He's in a
[36:48] backseline condition, but he ran to my
[36:50] home that following Monday morning to
[36:52] show me a letter that he had received
[36:55] that a job that he was after trying to
[36:57] get, he had received the confirmation
[36:59] that he must report to work. Amen.
[37:02] Listen, I believe God. I believe because
[37:05] I've seen the dead raise. My trustee
[37:09] today, Brother Dixon, he was on his way
[37:12] to Kingston that morning when he died in
[37:15] the VA. The vehicle went into the rocks
[37:18] and the police had come. They had taken
[37:20] the dead body. They were taking it to
[37:22] the hospital. But under desperation that
[37:25] morning, I cried out to God. And when I
[37:28] reached to my bed in desperation to
[37:30] pray, I grabbed my Bible. I open it. I
[37:33] saw Acts 1 and verse 8.
[37:37] You shall receive power after that the
[37:41] Holy Ghost is come upon you. And when I
[37:44] read the next verse, as the Holy Spirit
[37:46] tell me, I know he was dead because the
[37:48] Bible said, "And he was taken out of
[37:50] their sight." But I stood on my feet. I
[37:53] pierced the four. I said, "Lord, you
[37:55] promised that what we we ask, you will
[37:58] give it to us." Lord, let him come back
[38:00] to the church and tell the testimony of
[38:04] him being raised from the dead. And when
[38:06] the inspiration got to me, I dial again
[38:08] his wife and said, "Put the phone at his
[38:11] ears." And I prayed to the Lord Jesus
[38:14] Christ. God, you're so good to us. Amen.
[38:17] And God raised him from the dead that
[38:19] morning before the vehicle, reach into
[38:22] the mog. He was raised and sitting up
[38:25] and his wife crying out, "Brother Keith,
[38:27] he's trying to talk to you." The one
[38:29] that she cried is dead. Put the phone at
[38:33] his ears. He's now talking back to me. I
[38:36] went, they kept him three days in the
[38:38] hospital. The first time they put the
[38:39] phone on his ears, what kind of prayer
[38:41] did you pray? I said, "Lord
[38:43] Jesus, you promised to give us the
[38:46] desire of our heart. Lord, you know my
[38:49] brother how faithfully he is. I can't
[38:52] take this right now, but Lord, if you
[38:55] would bring him back to us and let him
[38:57] tell us what happened when he went to be
[39:00] on the curtain of time, bring my brother
[39:03] back, Lord. And listen, he rose from the
[39:06] dead. I didn't touch him. Faith knows no
[39:10] distance.
[39:12] The healing virtues of God know no
[39:14] distance. I remember also the brother
[39:17] who I first tra uh who had invited me to
[39:22] Kenya, brother John actually I met him
[39:25] in um Nigeria and I went to um Nairobi.
[39:31] I preached for them for one week. I'm
[39:32] sorry to interrupt you. Yeah. Um, there
[39:34] is the other part that was I really
[39:36] found so outstanding. Oh, brother Dixon.
[39:38] Of brother Dixon. Yes. Oh, yes. Let me
[39:40] let me tell the rest of Brother Dixon's
[39:42] uh testimony. But you know, I went to
[39:44] him in the hospital. He was there. He
[39:46] said, "Brother Keith," he said, "Man, I
[39:47] I died." He said, "When I when when when
[39:50] I passed out, I knew I died because I
[39:53] was looking at my body in the vehicle."
[39:55] Even when they were taking my body, I
[39:58] was watching the police as they take my
[40:00] body from around the steering wheel when
[40:02] they put me in that vehicle to lie down.
[40:04] And you know, I I saw my wife, my son
[40:06] was crying. He said, "I went back to my
[40:10] home and I walked around the house." He
[40:13] said, "Brother Keith, the the flowers in
[40:15] the garden was the most beautiful I'd
[40:17] seen." M he said as they took my body
[40:20] through the streets of Kingston he said
[40:22] I was looking down and I said Lord how
[40:24] did I live in that piss house for so
[40:27] long because he said from where I was I
[40:29] could see the crime and the violence and
[40:32] the ungodliness just cover over that
[40:34] city. He said where I was the feeling
[40:38] that I have. He said brother I never
[40:41] wanted to come back but he said brother
[40:43] Keith when you called my name I heard
[40:46] and I came back. Mhm. That's it. You
[40:49] know, we we thank God. Amen. We thank
[40:51] God. Well, he still raises the dead. God
[40:53] still raised the dead. Is that is the
[40:55] same yesterday done forever. I remember.
[40:57] Remember that's the the last words
[40:59] brother Bham spoke when he prayed for
[41:01] brother Brady. Amen. He said it's the
[41:02] same yesterday done forever. Yes sir.
[41:04] Yes sir. Amen. I I can remember my
[41:07] friend in Kenya, brother John. It was in
[41:10] the time of COVID and he was in the
[41:13] hospital dying. Really just could not
[41:15] breathe. I just could not breathe. And
[41:17] but when I went to Nairobi, I'd preach
[41:20] on the manifestation of the Holy Spirit.
[41:22] And that was why when I went to brother
[41:24] Whitcliff's church, I was to preach
[41:26] Monday and move on, but they let me
[41:28] preach Monday to Friday because they
[41:31] said, you know, we hear people preach
[41:33] the message, but they don't preach the
[41:35] manifestation of the Holy Spirit. And I
[41:37] was inspired to preach it. So, Brother
[41:39] John remembered that and he called me
[41:41] back in Jamaica. And you know I I right
[41:44] there on the phone I prayed for brother
[41:47] John Harry and immediately his breath
[41:52] came back to him normal. He was
[41:55] discharged from that hospital the same
[41:57] day that I prayed for him because
[42:00] almighty God heard that prayer. Amen.
[42:03] And heal my brother whom I love so much.
[42:06] Amen.
[42:07] Listen the bi you know this word tell us
[42:11] that if we would have compassion when we
[42:13] pray there was nothing that will stand
[42:16] before that prayer. Amen. And I
[42:18] personally believe that. Amen. Amen.
[42:20] Amen. Oh my. I felt like you should
[42:23] continue on and on and on and on because
[42:25] you're building many people's faith.
[42:27] Brother, we could speak of many
[42:30] manifestation, but but in my heart,
[42:33] these things happen because God want to
[42:36] show the people that he's here today and
[42:39] he's here in his word. Because my
[42:43] message to the people is that nobody has
[42:46] to lay hands on you. Exactly. When you
[42:49] receive that word of God, the sent time
[42:52] message, you know, divine healing is in
[42:56] that word, deliverance is in that word.
[42:59] And whatever it is that the devil can
[43:02] bring to you, this word come to deliver
[43:05] you. And I don't want to preach a gospel
[43:08] to the people that let them feel like a
[43:10] certain minister, a certain person has
[43:13] to be there to pray for them because the
[43:15] word of God is nigh thee even in thy
[43:17] mouth the word that we speak. And that's
[43:20] what Jesus gave it to Peter, you have
[43:23] faith in God. Yeah. For if you would say
[43:26] to this mountain, be thou moved and will
[43:29] not doubt in your heart, then all that
[43:31] you say shall come to pass. So this
[43:35] message is really about you, about me.
[43:37] Yes. Says, "Behold, I send you Elijah."
[43:40] Elijah the prophet. So it's not even
[43:42] about the prophet. It's about you. It's
[43:44] about you. Yeah. We are the focus. Yeah.
[43:47] Now we speak of the ministry today. Men
[43:51] want to build monument of themselves.
[43:54] Yeah. Elevate themselves to a position
[43:57] that I am the man. So people talks of a
[44:00] certain prophet and this in his life.
[44:02] Yet many times in manifesting trying to
[44:06] manifest the Holy Spirit, they've
[44:08] missed. Listen, God is not a failure.
[44:12] Yeah. God cannot wrong one time. And so,
[44:16] Brother Brandham shows us really, he
[44:18] said, listen, if you feel that you've
[44:20] got a gift from God in your life and one
[44:23] time you try to use it and it was wrong,
[44:26] he said, don't use it again. Don't try.
[44:29] Leave it alone. And so, that's not what
[44:31] we're for. But listen, when the time
[44:34] arises,
[44:36] whatever we need from God, it will be
[44:40] according as you say it. Because that is
[44:43] what was in the manifestation of the
[44:46] word in the third pull. Whatever you say
[44:50] shall come to pass. Yeah. God create a
[44:54] krill when there was no game. Just like
[44:57] he created a ram up on the mountain for
[45:00] Abraham when he was going to sacrifice
[45:03] his son. And in every time that was
[45:06] shown, it's God showing us that in every
[45:10] aspect of our lives, he will work for us
[45:13] really. Amen. Well, I really love what
[45:16] you said because uh one thing that is
[45:19] very distinct in this message is um um
[45:23] it's not something that pumps up a man
[45:27] but the word. The word and um you know
[45:31] uh where you find a minister, I mean
[45:33] especially in Pentecostalism, you find
[45:35] that it's all about a man, a man of God,
[45:37] a man, a man of God, a man of God. And
[45:39] you see church is all about the pastor
[45:42] but not about the word. and and you know
[45:45] but in what you said it's not about you
[45:47] even trying to manifest anything it's
[45:49] just you leaving the word and preaching
[45:51] that word and the people believing that
[45:52] word and becoming the what the word said
[45:54] that they would become so I would like
[45:58] to encourage you know the people who are
[46:00] listening in to focus on not
[46:04] only knowing what the word speaks of
[46:07] them but you know becoming that word
[46:09] because we are supposed to become that
[46:11] word now uh pastor Keith
[46:14] How do you stay grounded in the message
[46:17] amidst all these distractions and you
[46:19] know instability in the world and I
[46:22] should say in the message world today
[46:24] cuz I mean there's been a lot of um
[46:27] clicks and groups and camps but from
[46:30] what from the little fellowship I've had
[46:32] with you in neither of those
[46:35] camps. H how you were you able to do
[46:38] that? God has protected me from my
[46:40] youth. You you see um Jamaica there's a
[46:45] lot of countries the prophet never
[46:46] visit. I I'm proud that the the prophet
[46:49] of Malachi 4 put foot on my nation
[46:52] Jamaica. Not only that but there's a
[46:55] prophecy for Jamaica in the message
[46:58] straight is the gate. Brother Brandham
[46:59] speak of that um vision he had for
[47:02] Jamaica you know the little virgin
[47:04] church. And he said it like this. He
[47:06] said, you know, he talks about the him
[47:09] visiting the three nights that he would
[47:11] be there, the city blocks that would be
[47:14] covered, but he said, but the little
[47:16] church will be taken by the word into
[47:20] further things until it shake the entire
[47:22] island. Brother, when I came in as a
[47:26] young person, I was the youngest
[47:28] preacher around for the message. And
[47:30] when I came in, there was just one
[47:32] church really standing with the message
[47:34] in Jamaica. But I felt responsible
[47:37] because I believe that everything that
[47:39] God puts me through and bring me to this
[47:42] really is for a purpose. And I begin to
[47:45] seek the purpose of God for my life. Now
[47:48] I mean I've met many brothers and many
[47:51] of the names that you know people would
[47:54] have mentioned and so I I know them
[47:56] personally. I've rubbed shoulder with
[47:58] many men and so I am not after
[48:01] personality
[48:03] or to be something really. My name
[48:07] doesn't have to be
[48:09] mentioned but I want them to see the
[48:12] message of Malachi 4, Revelation 10:7 go
[48:16] forward. How do I keep grounded? It's
[48:20] the grace of God. Amen. because
[48:23] I many ministers are full-time. The only
[48:27] reason I can do the things I do, I also
[48:30] have a professional work. You know, I
[48:32] work professionally. Um I'm an
[48:35] electrical engineer by
[48:37] trade. I am a lecturer in business. I
[48:42] I've not lectured in electrical because
[48:44] my master's degree is in business. You
[48:46] know, I'm a lecturer. I'm a mentor for
[48:48] young people. I do things to help my
[48:52] government you know reaching out to
[48:53] young people really in polytechnic um
[48:56] try to curve their them to you know
[48:59] towards business mindedness and so and
[49:02] so there's many aspect to my life then
[49:05] personally I'm a farmer you know because
[49:08] um I believe into to be self contained
[49:12] as a person living an holistic life I
[49:17] don't believe in depending on people. I
[49:20] believe that all that I have need of God
[49:23] will provide it for me. Amen. And and
[49:26] that is what I see because I've seen a
[49:29] system today where people use money from
[49:32] might be the west and many group many
[49:36] honorable men preaches the gospel. They
[49:39] give because God has given to them and
[49:41] they freely give without attachment. But
[49:44] in many places you see people give
[49:46] because they're not only giving of their
[49:48] resource, they want to give of their own
[49:50] ideas, their own doctrine and all of
[49:53] that really. I say that the pastor I had
[49:57] really helped me in that really and then
[50:00] the personality I personally have. I I
[50:04] was uh I I graduated at uh uh 23 years
[50:08] old from university really. So I was
[50:11] marketable in myself. I can earn my own
[50:15] money really if I and I've seen other
[50:18] brothers who are not in the position
[50:19] that I am in really they have to depend
[50:21] on others ministers coming through you
[50:24] you know he needs help with resource
[50:26] really I I really am not that kind of
[50:29] person you know if if somebody is going
[50:31] to pass through me I want you to direct
[50:34] things to where it is really needed
[50:38] also in my life um because of the way my
[50:42] pastor do my former pastor brother Brady
[50:45] bless his heart bless his heart um
[50:50] missionary it was a part of us really
[50:53] that the first Tuesday of every August
[50:57] we are in North Carolina at a missionary
[51:00] camp meeting brother Henry Green to
[51:03] brother Dan Dasley to now brother Joe
[51:05] Green and in that meeting our focus is
[51:08] really to help churches throughout the
[51:11] world that ministry there in Bible
[51:15] tabernacle Ruth, North Carolina. It's
[51:18] not elevated. It's not talked about.
[51:20] Nobody even know the name of that
[51:21] church. Many they've never advertised
[51:25] where I mean you know that they provide
[51:28] funds because they didn't provide it.
[51:30] Different churches pull their funds
[51:32] together to help churches over the
[51:35] world. And this is what I look at when
[51:38] we bring people to the message.
[51:40] Sometimes they are kicked out of
[51:42] organizations and all of that. Really,
[51:44] we need to gather our people together
[51:46] because in order to teach our people and
[51:48] to bring them into further things in the
[51:50] word of God, we have to have churches.
[51:52] Yeah. We have to have men of God who are
[51:55] mature, who have the understanding, the
[51:58] anointing and the revelation of the word
[52:01] of God who have no attachment to nothing
[52:04] but to see the word of God go forward.
[52:07] brother, that is my heart,
[52:10] you know. I mean, I don't have to be
[52:13] seen, be known. I don't have to be in a
[52:17] city to be in a great place. I want to
[52:20] know where is the next place that my
[52:23] people might be under pressure because
[52:27] they don't have the resource and the
[52:29] connection that they need to really
[52:32] learn and be mature in the gospel. let
[52:36] me go. That is what I want to do. And
[52:38] then encourage others to go because in
[52:41] North Carolina the the the phrase that
[52:44] we use for that meeting, if you can't
[52:46] go, send somebody. Send somebody else
[52:49] and and that is it. And so it has helped
[52:51] me where I keep in the middle of the
[52:54] road. There is no camp no doctrine or so
[52:58] that I belong to really you know um I my
[53:03] name is known because might be I preach
[53:06] different places you know I've gone to
[53:07] different places by the grace of God
[53:10] nobody says that they send brother Keith
[53:13] I go from my own hurting you know God
[53:16] has blessed me and give me that faith
[53:19] that I believe that if I need the
[53:21] resource to go somewhere God will
[53:23] provide it and Brother, listen. God
[53:26] works upon our motive and our objective.
[53:28] If our motive is right, God will use
[53:32] that. And I thank God when I came to
[53:35] Uganda, I met brother Gideon. At my
[53:40] first trip, it was the end of my trip
[53:42] that I met brother Gideon. I thank God
[53:45] for the heart that he has, for the faith
[53:49] that he has that he did not ask for
[53:52] anything. No, he had one desire to see
[53:57] the word of God get to the people and my
[54:01] understanding from what I've seen he has
[54:03] tried everything in his power. I think
[54:06] he works too hard. But his desire is to
[54:09] see the word of God go out. And that is
[54:12] why if I'm going to be in Uganda, I'm
[54:15] going to be brother Gideon. He's my
[54:17] friend. He's my brother. And I love the
[54:20] work that he does and I really
[54:22] appreciate him really because God give
[54:25] him to me. The first day I step into his
[54:28] church and preach, he did not know me.
[54:30] Maybe see me at a convention, you know,
[54:32] our hearts as unite. And by that I have
[54:36] a base in Uganda where I can work from
[54:39] because everywhere I go, I need a base,
[54:41] you know, and I thank God I've met you
[54:42] on this trip and I thank God for your
[54:45] faith and your heart believing the word.
[54:47] But there's something I've seen in you
[54:49] that um I see in my past.
[54:53] You're a pastor of young people. When I
[54:56] started out um 30 years ago pastoring,
[54:58] the average age in our church was 22.
[55:02] And
[55:03] um I say this the the brothers say to
[55:06] me, they say, "Daddy, they you look at
[55:09] me to as an elder, but I don't feel that
[55:12] I'm older than 18 years old." Mhm. The
[55:15] time when I receive the revelation of
[55:17] the word, I still feel that way, you
[55:20] know, because um the young people
[55:23] wherever I go, they are drawn to me. And
[55:26] I love that because I believe that if
[55:29] God tries, we've seen the older ones
[55:32] going off the scene, the young ones that
[55:34] we have today, we are to mentor them
[55:37] because they are going to be the
[55:38] ministers of tomorrow. M and I know and
[55:41] I'm a certain that if I should go to the
[55:44] grave before my change and Christ has
[55:48] not called the bride into the rapture,
[55:51] this message is going to go from
[55:53] strength to strength because there'll
[55:56] always be a people perfected by the word
[56:00] and can make that body change. Amen.
[56:02] Amen. That's really very insightful and
[56:05] especially um uh you know the part of uh
[56:10] believing God and trusting God when he
[56:12] calls you into ministry because we've
[56:14] had it especially here in Africa you
[56:15] know it's been quite challenging because
[56:16] of um of the way people um should I say
[56:20] the perspective uh because life is hard
[56:23] life gets hard and so when some when God
[56:26] calls a man into ministry the first
[56:28] thing they they want to think about is
[56:29] who is going to support me and Then they
[56:33] forget that brother Banham says that if
[56:34] God sends you then he will support you.
[56:38] You but you provide but if a church
[56:40] sends you then they should provide for
[56:42] you. So uh then there's been fewer men
[56:46] trusting on God for God to provide and
[56:50] then you find they also do not want to
[56:52] work and they want to rely on others. So
[56:55] I think what you have given to us as
[56:57] what you have been able to do is you've
[57:00] been able to trust God. You've been able
[57:01] to work with your hands and this has
[57:03] helped you to be independent and
[57:05] self-reliant and then you you can stay
[57:08] grounded not to be you know taken to
[57:10] this camp that camp because well they're
[57:13] supporting you. Yeah. You know it's very
[57:16] important for young people really and
[57:18] and I say you know there was a saying
[57:20] when I came in you know and in the
[57:22] earlier years you hear it less today
[57:24] that education is of the devil. Mhm. But
[57:28] education is a tool. Money is a tool.
[57:32] Education is a tool to further the
[57:35] gospel. Because actually the respect I
[57:39] have back in my own country is because
[57:44] of I'm educated. I can speak to people
[57:48] at another level at times really. And
[57:52] just like money, it's a tool because it
[57:56] it help us to reach certain regions
[57:59] really. Now I say that America is a
[58:02] first world country and um there's
[58:04] people who really don't need education
[58:07] to make a living but a young man you're
[58:10] going to want a wife when you get to a
[58:13] certain age. You're going to have
[58:15] children. you you know and you're going
[58:17] to have to have a a source of
[58:20] survival when a brother says, "Oh,
[58:22] brother Keat, you know, I mean, my
[58:24] children are are kicked out of school
[58:26] because I can't pay the school fee, you
[58:28] know, and you're you're a pastor." And
[58:31] so, it's really hurt my heart really.
[58:34] But, you know, sometimes our perspective
[58:36] of how we look at things really is
[58:39] wrong. Yeah. And our motive is wrong.
[58:42] Yeah. Listen, I mean I went to college
[58:45] and during my college days was when I
[58:49] gathered strength for the
[58:51] gospel. Many things happened to me in my
[58:55] personal life, my family life at that
[58:57] time that gave me strength that I live
[59:01] in that chapel
[59:04] praying because of the things that were
[59:07] happening and that gather strength to
[59:09] me. Now I was being educated for the
[59:13] work that God has for me afterwards.
[59:16] When brothers come along, I mean I
[59:19] didn't go to them that I was seeking uh
[59:22] resource to go do things really. No, I
[59:26] had the tools to make a living. Yeah.
[59:29] And I say to our young people, get the
[59:32] tools in the years that you need to get
[59:34] your tools. Really? Yeah.
[59:36] parents uh invest in your children. M
[59:41] you know um the education minister in
[59:45] the shadow educator and minister of our
[59:48] country he visited our churches uh our
[59:51] church um I think three weeks ago
[59:53] because he heard of me really and you
[59:56] know I let him stand in the church and
[59:58] say something and he said if every
[1:00:01] household have one degree then we are
[1:00:05] alleviating poverty among our people.
[1:00:08] Mhm. Now somebody said well that is not
[1:00:10] necessary. Listen if you've got the
[1:00:12] skills you can say well I've have open
[1:00:15] fields let me go work the field. really
[1:00:18] what education does for you really it it
[1:00:21] points you into the area where you know
[1:00:23] where to acquire knowledge it might not
[1:00:27] be specific knowledge of uh say you know
[1:00:30] electrical or you know um you know civil
[1:00:34] engineering or or so but you know how to
[1:00:38] acquire resources that you need to put
[1:00:41] into to mobilize what you're going to do
[1:00:44] I mean I'm a very small farmer farmer,
[1:00:47] but I use tools to make work easy
[1:00:52] really. And so from you know you say you
[1:00:55] can say well I have an acre what can I
[1:00:57] do with one acre right? If you have
[1:01:00] knowledge, you learn right the best way.
[1:01:04] I could plant corn on it really, but how
[1:01:06] much work returns would I have from
[1:01:07] corn? Or I could put livestock. How much
[1:01:11] returns I have? So you you you have the
[1:01:13] knowledge to select the best way for the
[1:01:16] economy of scale of what you have
[1:01:18] really. Yeah. So education is important.
[1:01:21] Yeah. I mean as a pastor also sometimes
[1:01:24] to your people you become your the
[1:01:27] financial uh advisor counselor you
[1:01:30] become the social counselor the marriage
[1:01:32] counselor you're all things to all
[1:01:34] people. Yeah and we find in many areas
[1:01:37] churches sometimes suffer because the
[1:01:39] the the knowledge of the minister in
[1:01:42] different areas. It doesn't mean that he
[1:01:44] necessarily has to have a degree in
[1:01:46] something or something like that really
[1:01:47] but have the capacity to broaden your
[1:01:50] experience and your your your knowledge
[1:01:52] base really you can speak and being
[1:01:54] informed you know our young people the
[1:01:57] more they are informed the more
[1:01:59] knowledge they acquire is the more they
[1:02:02] can help others also you know but let us
[1:02:05] look at the Bible
[1:02:07] Peter was ignorant and unlearned
[1:02:09] if all that we had written in the New
[1:02:12] Testament ment was the writing of St.
[1:02:15] Peter. How much would we know about our
[1:02:17] walk? But God took a man who was
[1:02:21] educated on the Judaism. He learned at
[1:02:24] the feet of Gile. Paul was a scholar.
[1:02:28] But look the contribution. Yeah. That he
[1:02:31] make to the first church. Yeah. That our
[1:02:33] prophet could identify him as a
[1:02:35] messenger to the church. But yet Paul
[1:02:38] said, "All that I had, I count it but
[1:02:40] dong." But he had the capacity, the
[1:02:44] ability to write in a certain way and to
[1:02:48] understand and place complex things
[1:02:50] really that Peter thought that some
[1:02:53] things that Paul write it's hard to
[1:02:54] understand.
[1:02:56] So education is a tool. Mhm. Sometimes
[1:03:01] we've got to take that which is out
[1:03:03] there really, which is the devil's
[1:03:06] really, but we use it for the upliftment
[1:03:10] and the moving forth of the gospel of
[1:03:12] Jesus Christ really. So in our churches,
[1:03:14] we need doctors. We need Christian
[1:03:17] doctors. Mhm. You know, I go to a doctor
[1:03:19] and he's telling me he doesn't believe
[1:03:21] in God and they I don't want you to
[1:03:22] touch me. Yeah. But we have we have we
[1:03:25] have we have doctors. We have believers
[1:03:27] who are doctors. Yeah. We we have
[1:03:29] believers who are engineers. We have
[1:03:31] believers who will not I mean, you know,
[1:03:33] trick you in a business really because
[1:03:35] they are honest men. And so we're not
[1:03:38] going to take the back seat and said,
[1:03:40] "Oh, we ain't going to school because,
[1:03:41] you know, education's of the devil." No,
[1:03:43] no, no, no, no. Do your schooling. God
[1:03:46] will guide you through that. And I'm not
[1:03:48] afraid that say if our children go to
[1:03:51] university, they're going to backslide.
[1:03:53] No, no, no. M
[1:03:55] my I have two daughters and listen
[1:03:57] they've gone to the top of their
[1:03:59] education really I never worry about my
[1:04:01] oldest she's 34 thank God my youngest
[1:04:04] she's 27 and they are still in church
[1:04:08] they are fervent Christians my youngest
[1:04:10] she's a she she's a psychologist really
[1:04:12] she's a psychotherapist she sit before
[1:04:15] murderers and rapists and so and counel
[1:04:17] with them really and she's not afraid
[1:04:20] and even because the law she cannot
[1:04:22] project her it. But people find out and
[1:04:25] it's asking what is it that you believe?
[1:04:27] Because they know that there's something
[1:04:28] in this little woman. Wherever you go,
[1:04:30] you stand out because you're a child of
[1:04:33] God. Yeah. And it reflect in everything
[1:04:36] that you do. Yeah. David took the sword
[1:04:40] of Goliath and he killed him with it.
[1:04:43] That's it. Cut off his head. So it might
[1:04:46] be of the devil, but right there we can
[1:04:48] be able to use it to better ourselves.
[1:04:50] use it for all good. Yeah. And and so if
[1:04:54] you are following and you a young man, a
[1:04:57] young lady, and you you've not been in
[1:04:59] school or you're biased with school, you
[1:05:01] think it is a kind of thing for you to
[1:05:03] do, right? Right there, you've had it.
[1:05:05] If you're a parent, please take your
[1:05:06] children to school. I believe um that
[1:05:10] that is very very insightful. I mean, I
[1:05:12] had a a little more. I I wish I wish
[1:05:15] everything we we talked out of here
[1:05:17] could be brought back here about this
[1:05:20] subject. I mean there is much to talk
[1:05:21] about. There's much to talk about. And
[1:05:23] let me say though, you know, Africans
[1:05:25] might say, you know, but our people are
[1:05:27] poor. I grew up with just my mom and my
[1:05:30] mother was a wash woman. My mother was
[1:05:33] working $10 per week. Four boys going to
[1:05:36] high school and I went to high school
[1:05:40] without missing a day. when she did not
[1:05:44] have it, she borrowed from people who
[1:05:47] had it. And I can remember in the nights
[1:05:51] she was checking how much money she had
[1:05:54] owed to people in our community for
[1:05:55] sending us to school. Sometime it was
[1:05:58] over $100. That that time was a lot of
[1:06:02] money for us that we didn't have, but
[1:06:05] she made a sacrifice and it help us
[1:06:08] today. M I would encourage all young
[1:06:12] people take your schooling seriously. It
[1:06:16] will help you tomorrow.
[1:06:19] And and and there's a statement you made
[1:06:21] to the young people the other day. You
[1:06:23] you told them do not r try to rush life.
[1:06:26] That's it. Yeah. It will all fall in
[1:06:28] place. Yeah. It would all fall in place,
[1:06:31] you know. Praise the Lord. Well, I I was
[1:06:34] going to ask you uh you know the key
[1:06:36] that lesson that you'd give to the young
[1:06:38] ministers um in their early especially
[1:06:40] when they in the time of their early
[1:06:42] calling uh because you've been there and
[1:06:45] I'm sure this can help them. you you
[1:06:47] know I' I've heard many young men says
[1:06:49] really you know um and and it's it's as
[1:06:51] though they boast my ministry my
[1:06:54] ministry ah don't be like that read give
[1:07:00] attendance to
[1:07:01] reading and I I remember you know a
[1:07:04] young minister he said I don't read
[1:07:05] nothing but the message of the hour I
[1:07:08] read everything I read because I I need
[1:07:10] to broaden my my my knowledge base
[1:07:13] really you know that when I speak to
[1:07:15] somebody whether it's politics or you
[1:07:18] know I mean the in in the the business
[1:07:21] world business world or commerce you
[1:07:23] know what you're talking about I know
[1:07:24] what I'm talking about really I I read
[1:07:27] personal personally also I like to read
[1:07:29] my history you know I I want to know
[1:07:31] where I'm coming from as our musicians
[1:07:35] say if you don't know where you're
[1:07:36] coming from then you don't know where
[1:07:38] you're going you you know and be proud
[1:07:41] of who you are don't try to be like
[1:07:45] anybody else. David said, "I'm black,
[1:07:48] but I'm
[1:07:49] Comely, you you know, I mean, I don't
[1:07:51] put myself below anybody really." And
[1:07:53] one of the reason why because I mean,
[1:07:56] beyond what you see, I know the path
[1:08:00] through which God has brought me to be
[1:08:02] here. So, I say to young men, read,
[1:08:06] read, read, read the message of the
[1:08:09] hour. Jesus said, "You you you read the
[1:08:12] scripture, for in them you say you have
[1:08:14] eternal life, and these are they that
[1:08:16] testify of me." Don't be shallow in what
[1:08:20] you're saying. Read with understanding.
[1:08:24] Yeah. Listen. And I say to young men who
[1:08:28] want to be in
[1:08:29] ministry, stay with your
[1:08:32] pastor. Lift up his hands. Yeah. pray
[1:08:36] and fast for your pastor because that
[1:08:38] man what he's feeding you is going to
[1:08:41] manifest. Yeah. In your own ministry.
[1:08:43] Yeah. You understand? And and and that
[1:08:46] is very
[1:08:47] important. You look at a young man and
[1:08:51] how fervent he is and how he
[1:08:57] respects his pastor and
[1:09:01] support. when he moves to his ministry
[1:09:04] and his ministry begin to be mature, God
[1:09:06] is going to bless him. Yeah. In all that
[1:09:09] you do. Yeah, that's it. That's exactly
[1:09:11] right. Don't be gluttonous of anything.
[1:09:14] If you don't have God don't want to give
[1:09:17] it to you. Pray and ask God. We are not
[1:09:21] to be that our hands are out for
[1:09:22] begging. Because David said, "I once was
[1:09:25] young, now I'm whole. I've never seen
[1:09:27] the righteous forsaken. Neither is he
[1:09:30] begging bread." Mhm. Listen, if you
[1:09:32] desire to be in ministry, you desire a
[1:09:36] noble position, God is going to bless
[1:09:39] you in all of that really. Yes, God is
[1:09:42] going to bless you. So, don't run after
[1:09:44] it really. Don't run to the scene of
[1:09:46] ministers. Uh, no, no, no, no, no. The
[1:09:49] gift inside of your life will make room
[1:09:52] for you. And you see there's been a lot
[1:09:55] of things and actually because of what
[1:09:56] you're saying you you can now begin to
[1:09:58] see what has been happening especially
[1:10:00] on the African continent. Oh yes. Uh in
[1:10:03] the religious world you find that people
[1:10:05] go into all sorts of fanaticism. Yes.
[1:10:08] Simply because they are not educated.
[1:10:10] They do not know. They don't read. They
[1:10:12] they never read. And it is so sad to say
[1:10:14] but even message believers message
[1:10:17] believers don't read the message. You
[1:10:19] see so they don't really know what it is
[1:10:21] saying. So even they are prone to go
[1:10:23] into any sort of fanaticism especially
[1:10:26] if their leader is a fanatic in a way.
[1:10:29] So you you find that reading is very
[1:10:30] important. Yes. And and and in the early
[1:10:33] parts of you know preaching really I
[1:10:35] mean I might from one message I might
[1:10:38] quote from um seven different messages
[1:10:41] really and sometimes I don't quote it
[1:10:43] because I know what is there on the page
[1:10:45] you know so I just preach you know let
[1:10:47] the anointing lead me. But you know in
[1:10:49] the beginning really um I remember
[1:10:51] brother Joseph Freeman if I pronounce
[1:10:55] his name right I think he was at the
[1:10:56] meeting. He he was sharing a testimony
[1:10:58] in North Carolina. He said you know his
[1:11:00] pastor had died and you know they had
[1:11:02] elected him to take the church and he
[1:11:04] said he didn't know how to preach. He
[1:11:06] has never preached before but he said he
[1:11:07] take one message and he read it. He make
[1:11:09] points and that's all he repeat to the
[1:11:12] people. Start with one message, one
[1:11:14] message and you know then another one
[1:11:17] and another one. God would lead you into
[1:11:20] areas to put doctrines and messages
[1:11:23] together. Amen. You know, just be
[1:11:24] simple. Amen. Well, um our time is
[1:11:27] running and I'd like us to put this to a
[1:11:29] close in a few moments, but before we
[1:11:30] do, I'd like to go into faith in the
[1:11:32] marketplace. Very good subject here. you
[1:11:35] know you you you work for a
[1:11:36] multinational company and while you are
[1:11:39] also uh very active in the ministry so
[1:11:43] how do you maintain the balance well I
[1:11:45] I'll be honest with you you know
[1:11:49] um when I study I had a kind of
[1:11:53] discipline where I read three hours per
[1:11:57] day every day and it's it's breaking
[1:12:01] yourself into a kind of discipline that
[1:12:04] you structure yourself really structure
[1:12:05] your day each day. Each day has 24
[1:12:08] hours. And if you're going to sleep for
[1:12:11] 7 hours really, then you have seven from
[1:12:14] 24. Structure your time in such a way
[1:12:18] that you make the most productive use of
[1:12:22] the time that you have. you know, um the
[1:12:26] first thing that I do every single day,
[1:12:31] the first hour is pen to the word of
[1:12:34] God. That's it. That's my meditation
[1:12:37] time. When does your day start? Well, I
[1:12:39] I'll get up maybe at 5:30 or sometime
[1:12:42] 5:00 really. I I get up and I spend an
[1:12:44] hour, you know, just going through
[1:12:47] material really, you know, like that.
[1:12:49] And I've seen where brother Brandham
[1:12:51] said he pray in the early hours because
[1:12:54] that's the time that demons go to sleep,
[1:12:56] you know. So I I I find I get things
[1:12:58] that time really. But I mean my day is,
[1:13:02] you know, when I'm at home, I I run a
[1:13:04] full day cuz I I meditate early in the
[1:13:07] morning. When I go through the door to
[1:13:09] and I walk to the farm, that's my
[1:13:11] exercise time, you know. Um really
[1:13:15] that's the time I exercise. I move
[1:13:17] around, do things. I I take inventory of
[1:13:19] things that I have, things that I need
[1:13:21] to do, you know, look over my livestock
[1:13:23] and so then I go back home, I, you know,
[1:13:25] get myself ready and I go to my office
[1:13:27] really.
[1:13:29] Um, my work today is more like, you
[1:13:32] know, of a consultant really and
[1:13:34] directing, you know, other directing
[1:13:36] things really based on priority. So I I
[1:13:40] I'm not a wrench time worker anymore cuz
[1:13:43] this year um is going to be December is
[1:13:46] going to be 37 years since I work with
[1:13:48] um the boxite aluminina company really.
[1:13:52] So um a lot of my day also my time might
[1:13:55] be spent helping HR because of my
[1:13:58] knowledge in business and law company
[1:14:01] law of contracts doing investigations
[1:14:04] really research but um in my team we
[1:14:07] have electrical engineers I have
[1:14:09] instrument engineers I have instrument
[1:14:12] electricians electrical power electrons
[1:14:14] I have um craftmen laborers you know so
[1:14:18] we have a big team to work with really
[1:14:20] and so But I direct people's lives. Now
[1:14:23] I I'm at the stage in my life where if I
[1:14:25] want to spend four hours in my office
[1:14:28] just preparing a message to preach on
[1:14:30] Sunday, I can do it. It's no problem to
[1:14:33] nobody. But you know, I mean over the
[1:14:35] years you develop respect. People
[1:14:37] respect you because of the way you live
[1:14:39] your life, because of the way you do. I
[1:14:41] mean my plant manager, you know, as I
[1:14:44] was leaving, you know, he said, "Man,
[1:14:46] listen, you take it from me. I'm coming
[1:14:49] with you to Africa." you know, he wants
[1:14:51] to see things that happen here, you
[1:14:53] know, and he's a nominal Christian
[1:14:55] really. And so, but you know, he they
[1:14:58] asked me to pray for a plant the start
[1:15:00] of every week. That is respect. My
[1:15:04] because people see your life. I remember
[1:15:07] 37 years ago, I was the youngest person
[1:15:09] in the department. They said many people
[1:15:12] come as Christians. They're no longer
[1:15:13] Christians. They backslid. Yeah. Well,
[1:15:15] 37 years after, I'm still a Christian
[1:15:19] and I still believe in the power of God.
[1:15:21] And if people have, whether they be a
[1:15:24] janitor, an engineer or whoever they
[1:15:26] are, have a problem spiritually, they
[1:15:29] come sit with me in my office and we
[1:15:31] talk about it. I can pray with them
[1:15:32] really. So, you develop a life where
[1:15:34] people respect you. Structure your life.
[1:15:37] Structure your life. you know um I do
[1:15:39] lectures really and um you know they
[1:15:43] they say at the heart foundation you
[1:15:46] know um that is our polytenic
[1:15:49] institution they said there's one thing
[1:15:52] about you anytime we call you you are
[1:15:55] there let people respect you because you
[1:15:58] are pontual because you keep schedule
[1:16:03] and whatever you say you're going to
[1:16:05] do exactly what you say you're going to
[1:16:09] do. Don't say you're going to do it. You
[1:16:11] change your mind. People can't have
[1:16:13] confidence in you.
[1:16:16] I am not a I am not a
[1:16:19] junior. I am not 20 years old. I'm a old
[1:16:23] man. I It's I find it hard to believe
[1:16:26] because I don't feel that way, you know.
[1:16:28] I can run faster than any one of these
[1:16:29] young guys here. also because I'm
[1:16:31] Jamaican and you know we have the
[1:16:33] fastest people in the world you know and
[1:16:36] so but um you know I still feel that
[1:16:39] there's a lot that I still have can do
[1:16:42] you know I I say we can balance our work
[1:16:47] um our professional work our spiritual
[1:16:49] work and our own business
[1:16:53] and also um it's very important for us
[1:16:56] we preach a message that we're not
[1:16:58] accepted by everybody we need to be
[1:17:00] independ dependent live a certain life
[1:17:02] that you depend on nobody. Yeah. So I
[1:17:06] earn my own. So not because you are
[1:17:08] employed to a company you have one
[1:17:11] stream of income and that is it really.
[1:17:14] No have as much stream of income as you
[1:17:17] can so that you have liberty to do other
[1:17:21] things. You can give to others really.
[1:17:23] you you know I mean I for one the way we
[1:17:26] structure our church I take some of the
[1:17:29] load from the church in paying the
[1:17:31] utilities and things like that so that
[1:17:33] the brothers can take care of the the
[1:17:35] the needs in the church really and so
[1:17:39] but I can only do that because I do
[1:17:41] other things for my living you know my
[1:17:44] travel I've never traveled with money
[1:17:47] that I earn from my company no I travel
[1:17:51] with money that I earn for my business
[1:17:53] because I asked the brothers to pray.
[1:17:55] God bless it and it provide for my
[1:17:58] traveling really. So you know that
[1:18:01] that's it. There's many things I have to
[1:18:03] go to the textbook to tell you but uh
[1:18:06] you know I can tell you the basic things
[1:18:08] in life really. Yeah. Be a Christian at
[1:18:11] your place of work. Amen.
[1:18:14] Let people know you're a believer
[1:18:16] wherever you are. Wherever you are. So
[1:18:19] tell them upfront Yeah. that you're a
[1:18:21] believer. Don't try to be like them. No,
[1:18:23] no, no, no. Don't be an hypocrite. H
[1:18:25] Some young people believe business and
[1:18:27] ministry don't don't mix. So, how would
[1:18:29] you advise them to see the harmony
[1:18:31] between the two? Well, listen, you
[1:18:33] you've got to have the B mind for it
[1:18:34] really.
[1:18:37] Discipline, you know, brothers, I
[1:18:39] remember brother um sent me a text and
[1:18:42] he he was texting and I respond, but but
[1:18:44] I have things I'm doing things really.
[1:18:47] And he said, you know, brother Keith,
[1:18:48] you you you you don't spend time
[1:18:50] speaking to the little people really,
[1:18:52] you know, because you and I said,
[1:18:53] brother, listen, it it's not that I've
[1:18:56] got to work. I've got things that I need
[1:18:58] to do, you know, and um I can't just I
[1:19:01] don't call somebody. Brother Gideon has
[1:19:03] been my friend for years. I've never
[1:19:05] called Brother Gideon on the phone just
[1:19:06] to say hello or hi or talk about and
[1:19:10] something trivial. I've never done that.
[1:19:13] And and people who know me know that I I
[1:19:16] don't do that. If I ever call you on the
[1:19:18] phone, it's for something very specific.
[1:19:21] There's a purpose. Yes. Because whatever
[1:19:23] you do because my life is structured.
[1:19:26] What I do from day to day is very
[1:19:28] structured. I have no time for idle
[1:19:31] talk. If you want to meet with me
[1:19:34] because you have a spiritual need and we
[1:19:36] need to talk about it that I have time
[1:19:38] for. And you see pastor, it's a problem.
[1:19:40] You know, you find people calling you
[1:19:42] and and they're like, "I want to greet
[1:19:43] you." If you don't give them time, they
[1:19:45] say you're proud. Yeah. I I I don't have
[1:19:47] time for it. I'm I'm sorry. I I just
[1:19:48] don't have the time because of where I
[1:19:50] am now. Might be when I'm older, when I
[1:19:52] reach 75 or 80 and you do less things in
[1:19:56] my life, then maybe I can sit and chat
[1:19:58] all day, but I I I don't have time for
[1:20:00] it. I I don't have the time for it. You
[1:20:02] know, and but but one thing is certain
[1:20:04] though to be approachable for the
[1:20:06] people. It doesn't matter where I'm at
[1:20:10] or what I'm doing. If my people need me
[1:20:13] because they have a problem, everything
[1:20:16] stop
[1:20:18] because
[1:20:19] the number one purpose of my life is to
[1:20:23] serve God and serve the people of God.
[1:20:25] Amen. Not my business, not my job is to
[1:20:29] serve God and serve his people. And
[1:20:31] other those things that I do is that I
[1:20:34] might serve them better. And anytime it
[1:20:36] get to the state where I can't serve my
[1:20:38] people because I have a job because I
[1:20:41] have a farm, you know, I will stop doing
[1:20:43] that and serve my people. You've talked
[1:20:45] about structuring um yourself or
[1:20:47] oneself. Uh but then let me just bring
[1:20:50] it this way. What message principles uh
[1:20:53] guide your approach to business and to
[1:20:55] leadership especially in the corporate
[1:20:57] space?
[1:21:00] That's
[1:21:02] uh brother Brham was always in contact
[1:21:06] with the Christian businessmen. Yeah.
[1:21:09] You know, and that was aspect of his
[1:21:11] life. But also
[1:21:13] um really when brother Brham left
[1:21:16] Jeffville and moved west
[1:21:19] um as you know I was told by one of the
[1:21:22] Holder brothers really brother Brandham
[1:21:24] wanted a a settlement meant for the
[1:21:27] family really and he wanted to do
[1:21:29] something that the family was settled
[1:21:31] but remember now also brother Brham was
[1:21:33] a trapper brother Brham was a game wer
[1:21:37] you know so while the time that brother
[1:21:39] Brham preaches he also did other things.
[1:21:42] So, Brother Brandham did not sit around
[1:21:44] in an office and play with pages all day
[1:21:47] long, you know. No, no, no, no, no. He
[1:21:50] was always and he was a guide, you know,
[1:21:52] to to visitors. And so, really, the
[1:21:54] Apostle Paul was a tent maker, you know.
[1:21:58] And so, so we ought not to say that
[1:22:00] because, you know, I remember brother
[1:22:03] having 10 persons in the church and he
[1:22:05] said, "Boy, you know, I don't want to
[1:22:06] work. It will get in the get in the way
[1:22:09] of the ministry." But you ain't got
[1:22:10] nothing doing. If you counseledled with
[1:22:13] each person, 10 persons for one hour for
[1:22:16] the day, the day is still not done, you
[1:22:19] know. So we ought not to do that. And
[1:22:22] most important, not to put ourselves on
[1:22:25] a pedestal that we cannot be reached by
[1:22:28] the people. A minister must be
[1:22:30] approachable. He must be reachable. We
[1:22:33] must not live in an air where we think
[1:22:36] that we are better than the people.
[1:22:39] Though we do not take part in trivial
[1:22:42] matters, joking around or goofing around
[1:22:45] really, you know, but we must be
[1:22:48] approachable where people are
[1:22:50] comfortable to speak to us and approach
[1:22:52] us. Really, young people have needs that
[1:22:55] they to talk about really. We must be in
[1:22:57] a position where we have time that they
[1:23:00] can be with us. There's a lot we can
[1:23:02] talk about faith in the marketplace. Uh
[1:23:04] I guess we can't even get it. Oh,
[1:23:06] brother. anyway in this little time that
[1:23:09] we have. But maybe your last comments on
[1:23:12] that subject and then we can try to My
[1:23:14] last comment really God opened doors for
[1:23:16] us really. Yeah, we I mean my pig farm I
[1:23:20] supplied before co I supplied one pig
[1:23:23] per week or one every two weeks or our
[1:23:27] chickens really we were
[1:23:31] uh supplying might
[1:23:34] be I I can't even remember our poundage
[1:23:36] now really that we're supplying might be
[1:23:40] um 200 pounds you know might be every
[1:23:43] two 3 weeks or so really when
[1:23:47] COVID pressure came on and I prayed. I I
[1:23:51] I think I asked some brothers different
[1:23:53] places to pray, help me pray for a
[1:23:57] business. And listen, God opened doors
[1:24:00] at that time when things were bad, where
[1:24:03] everything was falling, where businesses
[1:24:05] were closed. That was a time that our
[1:24:07] business
[1:24:09] exploded. Faith put God in whatever you
[1:24:14] do. We've been in the market this year
[1:24:18] five years and um people around us
[1:24:22] things are bad. Nothing is selling but
[1:24:25] we still sell maximum
[1:24:28] you know and so really we started
[1:24:32] supplying to a market 30% of what the
[1:24:35] market demanded. Today we're up to about
[1:24:39] 85% really we're helping other farmers.
[1:24:42] God. And one thing for certain, they
[1:24:46] used to call me the chicken man in Oeras
[1:24:49] because we supply chicken. That's what
[1:24:51] they know. Today, everybody call me
[1:24:53] pastor. And everybody having spiritual
[1:24:57] need, they want to talk to pastor. And
[1:25:00] some are barmaids, some are prostitutes,
[1:25:03] some are just good Christian, nominal
[1:25:06] Christians. Whoever they are, they now
[1:25:08] see us as believers. And people tell us
[1:25:12] you are different from the rest. Cuz we
[1:25:14] live we live in our business. You have
[1:25:18] business people who hope and don't
[1:25:20] pay who who credit things and never pay
[1:25:24] for it. Business people who are
[1:25:26] Christians. Listen, when you're a
[1:25:29] Christian, you do business according to
[1:25:33] God's word. Yeah. Ow no man and let no
[1:25:37] man hold you. People hold their stock
[1:25:40] waiting to sell to us when we've got a
[1:25:42] need and we said sell it. We don't know
[1:25:44] when we can reach you. They said we will
[1:25:46] not sell it until you are ready for it
[1:25:48] really because in our business we are
[1:25:51] Christians in everything that we do. And
[1:25:55] if I do business, if I buy livestock
[1:25:57] from somebody, I want to make sure that
[1:25:59] not only I'm satisfied, he's also
[1:26:02] satisfied with the negotiation and the
[1:26:05] deal that we come to. He's satisfied and
[1:26:07] I'm satisfied because at the end of the
[1:26:09] day say about me I do business like a
[1:26:13] Christian. Amen. I'm a child of God.
[1:26:15] Amen. Thank you so much for that. And
[1:26:17] now we go to the final uh questions. Um
[1:26:21] and this is very personal because you're
[1:26:23] talking to young
[1:26:25] people. What do you see as the biggest
[1:26:28] threat? Um especially on the spiritual
[1:26:31] side, the spiritual threat to the youth
[1:26:32] in the message today. How can you advise
[1:26:36] them to overcome them? Worldliness.
[1:26:38] Worldliness. Brother Brandham said
[1:26:40] worldliness would be the number one sin.
[1:26:43] Let me show you
[1:26:45] what our young people interact with our
[1:26:49] societies really. And you you pass you
[1:26:52] you you're at a certain age, certain
[1:26:55] level. When you were growing up, you you
[1:26:57] heard the music of the world and it had
[1:27:01] some effect on you really. our young
[1:27:04] people today the music that they hear
[1:27:05] the music of the world and I can say
[1:27:08] Jamaica has export the music to the
[1:27:11] world and it's the worst it's the the
[1:27:14] lowest and the most degrading music in
[1:27:16] all the world Jamaican music that's what
[1:27:21] it has gotten to today and our young
[1:27:23] people they hear these things I listen
[1:27:27] and I don't even hear the words that
[1:27:28] they're saying but they hear it
[1:27:32] the
[1:27:34] billboards, television for those who see
[1:27:37] it. And everything is set up in a
[1:27:39] certain way. It's the marketing
[1:27:43] of of of the devil, Satan's Eden. It's
[1:27:47] set to catch you, to turn you a certain
[1:27:49] way.
[1:27:51] Homosexuality, it's there before your
[1:27:53] face. You are not enraged about it
[1:27:55] really because it's there. You You get
[1:27:57] used to it really. you you get used to
[1:28:00] people using indecent languages and you
[1:28:03] know if you're not careful you you you
[1:28:06] slip and you say the same thing really
[1:28:08] the battles we fought our young people
[1:28:11] are fighting a greater battle today and
[1:28:14] so it is to for us really not to just
[1:28:18] tell them oh we were because might be if
[1:28:21] we were if I was 20 today I would have a
[1:28:23] harder battle to fight than when I was
[1:28:25] 20 because there was less demons that I
[1:28:28] had to right back then that we've got to
[1:28:30] be aware. I was listening to an African
[1:28:34] pastor preaching two weeks ago and he
[1:28:37] said that
[1:28:39] uh parents are giving their 16year-old a
[1:28:43] cell phone. How could you give a 16y old
[1:28:45] a cell phone? Huh? Well, listen. I I
[1:28:50] don't know about Africa but in the west
[1:28:52] if a 16-year-old don't have a cell phone
[1:28:55] that 16year-old would fail in school and
[1:28:58] all of that really because everything
[1:29:00] today is on the net. We the education
[1:29:04] today is all there. It's worldwide. Your
[1:29:07] minds are open up. It's a worldwide
[1:29:10] contact that we have and our young
[1:29:12] people is a part of that. And this is
[1:29:14] the reason why if we miss on teaching
[1:29:19] the Holy Ghost to our young people,
[1:29:21] yeah, we will miss our church.
[1:29:24] If you give them a false sense of
[1:29:26] security that ah because you believe
[1:29:29] that God's in a prophet, you've got the
[1:29:31] Holy Ghost and they don't have that life
[1:29:33] of Jesus in them, they're going to fail.
[1:29:37] Brother, you don't have to watch your
[1:29:39] children when they go out there. You
[1:29:40] don't have to worry about them when they
[1:29:42] go to college that they're going to take
[1:29:43] the wrong influence. What you need to do
[1:29:46] is to ensure that in every church we
[1:29:49] teaches the Holy Ghost and ensure we set
[1:29:53] the church in such a way that the power
[1:29:55] of God fall in the heart of those young
[1:29:58] people or else they will never survive
[1:30:01] in the world that we are living today.
[1:30:02] Yeah. And so I say to our young people,
[1:30:06] whatever you do, make sure the life of
[1:30:09] Jesus Christ is in you. That is it. That
[1:30:13] is the solution. That is it. There's one
[1:30:15] solution. The Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen.
[1:30:21] Wow. I I was touched by that. Um um I am
[1:30:25] speechless. God bless you so much for
[1:30:27] that council. Now, if you could speak to
[1:30:29] the younger Keith
[1:30:31] Reed. um just starting out. What would
[1:30:34] you tell him
[1:30:38] today? Ah man
[1:30:46] man pray
[1:30:48] more, fast
[1:30:51] more, read more of the word.
[1:30:55] You
[1:30:55] know, I thank God for that which what I
[1:30:59] did,
[1:31:00] but I wish I did more
[1:31:03] because might be I don't know, I would
[1:31:08] be in a different place today.
[1:31:11] But
[1:31:12] um I did not do as much as I needed to
[1:31:16] do in
[1:31:17] evangelism because of how I was
[1:31:21] um
[1:31:23] connected to
[1:31:25] work. You know, it was tremendous
[1:31:28] sacrifice to be where I am at
[1:31:31] intellectually
[1:31:33] and so and um it took some things from
[1:31:36] me but I must say by the grace of God he
[1:31:40] has kept me you know he has kept me the
[1:31:44] things the way I live my life today I
[1:31:46] wish I live my life like that when I was
[1:31:49] 20 years old you know and so so I said
[1:31:55] as I say before study.
[1:31:58] Give attendance to
[1:32:00] reading.
[1:32:02] Pray, be sensitive to the spirit of God,
[1:32:06] the leading of the Holy Spirit.
[1:32:10] Make sure that you have an
[1:32:16] hon. And the only way you're going to
[1:32:18] get that is through prayer.
[1:32:22] And surrendering your life to Jesus
[1:32:24] Christ.
[1:32:26] The more that I surrender is a light to
[1:32:30] my Lord. Amen.
[1:32:32] Amen. Well, um I only have one last
[1:32:36] question here now. It's not a question.
[1:32:37] It's like a statement.
[1:32:39] Um this is being recorded probably I do
[1:32:42] not know for how long. Um the Lord we
[1:32:44] have until the Lord comes. I believe
[1:32:46] that uh the rapture can happen anytime
[1:32:48] soon. Uh maybe the next minute. We do
[1:32:51] not know. But we also do not know how
[1:32:53] long we're going to have on this earth.
[1:32:55] Uh but this shall be watched if the Lord
[1:32:57] tries for many many more years to come.
[1:32:59] Amen. What do you want to be remembered
[1:33:03] for? And it's very good I'm asking you
[1:33:06] this question right on the mission
[1:33:08] field. Amen. In Africa. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:12] Amen. That I was not
[1:33:15] disobedient to the heavenly vision.
[1:33:19] I had a burning
[1:33:22] desire not just that people say the name
[1:33:27] of a prophetic forerunner William Brham
[1:33:30] but that the message that he
[1:33:32] brought and energized their lives and
[1:33:36] they live by that word and so the
[1:33:39] generation that is to come press on the
[1:33:42] word of God. Amen. He will see you
[1:33:45] through. Amen. Um I'm going to ask the
[1:33:48] sister to sing a song and and uh any
[1:33:51] maybe a chorus and uh I know you shared
[1:33:54] a few testimonies of what the Lord has
[1:33:55] done through your ministry and it's not
[1:33:57] by accident you are here. It's not by
[1:33:59] accident that many are connected at this
[1:34:01] moment and also those who are here. So
[1:34:03] I'm going to ask you to uh pray for them
[1:34:07] uh that whatever need that they have
[1:34:08] that the Lord may be able to intervene
[1:34:10] in their lives. Thank you so much for
[1:34:12] coming to be a part of this program.
[1:34:14] It's been a real honor. It was a honor
[1:34:16] to travel with you to Kenya. That was a
[1:34:19] blessing. And also to our young people
[1:34:20] that were with us and a honor to have
[1:34:22] you here at the bench today. Let us ask
[1:34:24] our sister to sing a little chorus and
[1:34:26] then after that you will pray.

[1:36:58] time of fellowship.
[1:37:01] Thank you Lord God for those who would
[1:37:03] hear this
[1:37:05] tape. Father Lord we pray that what
[1:37:08] we've said may not stumble them oh God
[1:37:11] but Lord God may positively affect their
[1:37:14] lives in a positive way. Father, we pray
[1:37:18] God that by your Holy Spirit, may you
[1:37:21] carry, oh God, the words that we present
[1:37:24] today, oh God, and Father, we pray that
[1:37:27] it may be effective in the life of
[1:37:30] others. Lord, we pray that, oh God, as
[1:37:33] these young people go through the
[1:37:35] different strains and struggles of their
[1:37:37] life, Lord God, we pray that you would
[1:37:40] guide them, oh God, and Lord, cause, oh
[1:37:43] God, things to happen in their lives
[1:37:46] that would direct them, oh God, in the
[1:37:48] right path. Lord, we even pray for those
[1:37:50] who feel today that they've made errors
[1:37:54] and there were obstacles in their way
[1:37:56] and they they have failed many times.
[1:37:59] But Lord God, we thank you that you are
[1:38:00] the God of grace. That Lord God, you did
[1:38:04] not save us. You did not carry us
[1:38:05] through because we were good. But Lord
[1:38:08] God is by your unmmerited favor. And we
[1:38:11] pray, oh God, that you'd rescue the
[1:38:13] perishing. You'd care for the dying.
[1:38:16] Snatch them in pity. Shut out, oh God,
[1:38:20] the distractions of the world today.
[1:38:23] That Lord God, they might look steadfast
[1:38:25] in your face. And Lord God, may your
[1:38:28] victory be their victory. Have your way,
[1:38:30] God, in our lives. And we thank you,
[1:38:32] Lord God, for the way you have led us
[1:38:34] and keep us. May you, oh God, also keep
[1:38:37] others as we soldier on. Cuz Lord, we
[1:38:42] have a mind to serve you. And Lord God,
[1:38:45] we have decided that we would believe
[1:38:47] your word. Lord God, we pray that you'll
[1:38:50] send your holy angels always to guide us
[1:38:53] as we walk this path. as we give you the
[1:38:56] preeminence in Jesus Christ's name we
