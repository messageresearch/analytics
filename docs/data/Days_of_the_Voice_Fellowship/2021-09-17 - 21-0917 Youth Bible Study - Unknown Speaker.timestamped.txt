[7:50] we don't know what a god will do but we

[7:56] called me
[7:57] yeah so we are expecting for the lord to

[8:09] means about what the lord has done for

[8:37] is the light hallelujah
[8:46] [Music]
[8:53] pass the songs
[8:57] uh
[8:58] i
[8:59] expected you said you are in 200 so this

[28:48] [Music]
[28:57] okay so you might need to come a bit
[28:58] closer
[29:10] okay go ahead the journey there has been
[29:13] a blessing
[29:14] to me
[29:16] i started it well from here
[29:23] going there we reached sorority from
[29:27] sorority i proceeded to mira from lyra
[29:30] to kitabun
[29:32] that is when the devil tried to
[29:36] fall
[29:38] when we reached the way the tax got
[29:41] spoiled
[29:42] and the time was
[29:44] a bit late
[29:46] and there were the that's a good point
[29:49] i didn't know anyone in that place
[29:52] and i didn't have any contact my my
[29:54] phone went off
[29:56] and i didn't know anyone in the taxi
[29:59] so they got started
[30:02] what i decided to do the time was going
[30:04] late it was going to 3 p.m
[30:07] to 9 p.m
[30:09] so there was nothing i could do
[30:12] then
[30:14] what i had to do i had to pray to go to
[30:17] oakland
[30:18] to at least give me wisdom where should
[30:21] i go and sleep by that time
[30:24] had this been that i was not a child of
[30:26] god
[30:28] i would have got problems there
[30:31] when i prayed
[30:33] everyone was just leaving the taxi
[30:35] everyone
[30:36] because the people i sat with their home
[30:39] was nearly
[30:40] the left were only three in the taxi
[30:43] and the two women stayed next to the
[30:46] driver only me was going too far
[30:50] then they came and
[30:52] repaired the that's
[30:55] and by that time nobody going where i
[30:58] was going no no
[31:00] no tax going where i was going so i
[31:03] started there
[31:04] what god gave me that was done
[31:08] i pretended not to understand my own
[31:11] language
[31:14] by the time we drove
[31:16] the the driver took the two with me now
[31:19] i was alone with the driver in the
[31:21] attacks
[31:22] so the driver started talking
[31:25] but things
[31:26] thinking that made me i don't understand
[31:29] the language even he called he called a
[31:32] woman that ah
[31:34] i have a girl here
[31:36] so you have to get for me a lot
[31:39] what yet me was understanding everything
[31:41] was saying about me
[31:44] then after understanding what he was
[31:46] planning to do
[31:48] i had to introduce myself
[31:50] i had my i didn't pop my bible in the
[31:53] back i had it in my hand like this
[31:56] so
[31:57] i had to introduce myself to him i told
[32:00] him i'm a christian i entered i
[32:03] introduced myself into detail even i
[32:06] tried to preach to you
[32:08] by that time that man got so scared
[32:11] he could not do what he was planning to
[32:13] do
[32:14] then what she did by that time
[32:17] he drove me straight to a pastor's home
[32:21] when went there the pastor's home
[32:23] again i continued pretending i wanted to
[32:26] know
[32:27] what they're planning really
[32:30] again the past time
[32:32] at that pastor's home there was nothing
[32:35] but they were hey this girl is so good
[32:37] she's a nice girl and you see the way
[32:39] she's dressing
[32:41] every good things about me i realized
[32:44] that pastor have nothing
[32:46] but plan with me
[32:48] then i stayed
[32:50] in
[32:52] in the
[32:54] during in the evening because even they
[32:57] have the service in the evening the way
[32:59] we always have fear
[33:01] after prayer i started sharing with that
[33:04] pastor
[33:05] i shared with that pastor he was
[33:07] receiving it i gave him the church egg
[33:10] book and track
[33:13] he really liked it and he told me he's
[33:15] going to go first about this he told me
[33:18] this thing is real you wait i'll call
[33:20] you pastor in the morning i left going
[33:24] there
[33:25] i was also meeting other pastors
[33:29] i went in the church
[33:31] of which also i've preached to the
[33:34] pastor
[33:35] and the pastor called him i didn't know
[33:38] that he called him but i got a message
[33:40] from here that he could
[33:42] going there all people were just happy
[33:45] when i told rama i told them after
[33:48] giving trots i told them my pastor will
[33:50] come here one day people were so excited
[33:53] they were just willing to receive the
[33:55] message
[33:57] and they told me
[33:58] immediately after giving the drugs i
[34:01] think they they really failed it they
[34:03] started registering people's name for
[34:05] baptism
[34:07] i don't know how they will do it i think
[34:09] they will need hope from pasta
[34:12] they started even right now as i took i
[34:15] left them registered because
[34:18] they were so willing to receive
[34:21] and to another place
[34:23] a bit further in the same district but
[34:26] very far
[34:27] i met some i made i met a catholic
[34:30] priest and
[34:32] passed a pastor for pentecost
[34:36] we were like three people
[34:38] i shared with them only one received
[34:41] that day
[34:42] and the two the the catholic and the
[34:45] other one did not receive anything they
[34:47] were like abusing they were like i was
[34:50] they told me that you are the people
[34:52] from underwater yoga we don't want your
[34:55] message but only one person got their
[34:57] revelation and up to now
[35:00] i'm waiting he will call me
[35:02] but he has received it
[35:05] he also
[35:06] he thanks me for going there
[35:09] and
[35:10] another one another teacher catechist
[35:12] for catholic also he received it and is
[35:15] waiting for pastor to go there to tell
[35:17] you more
[35:19] yes i talk now many people even my my
[35:22] own parents my mother has believed
[35:26] and
[35:27] either my
[35:29] my uncle brother to my father's belief
[35:34] the young
[35:35] people just waiting
[35:37] again coming back
[35:39] the other pastor slept at his place
[35:42] i didn't
[35:43] i didn't go to his name i didn't get his
[35:46] number
[35:47] but i was thinking now
[35:49] that first half i've been preaching to
[35:51] him and there's nothing i can do and i
[35:54] did pick his number what we like
[35:58] you say

[36:03] when i was coming passing that place i
[36:05] was remembering as if i slept beside but
[36:07] i could not remember it so well
[36:11] then there's a man who entered the
[36:12] [Music]
[36:14] the bus
[36:16] and the contractor was telling him to go
[36:18] behind
[36:20] he told the conductor let me sit next to
[36:23] my daughter here
[36:25] when he sat next to me we drove a bit
[36:28] then i started preaching to him
[36:31] then he asked me i gave him truck he
[36:34] read from there then he started asking
[36:37] who's your pastor where do you pray oh
[36:39] what is your name where do you stay
[36:41] i answer
[36:43] then i ask him why do you pray from kit
[36:46] kung he told me who's your pastor it was
[36:49] a real pastor i slept at this place
[36:52] which the person i was looking for his
[36:55] number god brought it
[36:57] then that man came
[36:59] then i said you mean you pray you you're
[37:02] praising that pastor's church that yes
[37:06] then i said that is fine now from my
[37:08] others saying thank you go
[37:11] that man gave me his number and he told
[37:14] me if i come he will be calling and we
[37:16] call it
[37:18] that's all
[37:20] amen
[37:25] you know
[37:27] one thing amazing
[37:29] about all this is
[37:32] we know that the bible says that women
[37:35] are not supposed to be preachers
[37:38] women should not
[37:40] worship authority
[37:42] over the man the scripture right
[37:45] but let this be a testament to all of us
[37:48] that because god told
[37:50] the woman that our office is not
[37:53] teaching or preaching it does not
[37:55] necessarily mean
[37:57] she cannot witness
[38:00] you understand
[38:02] in ethiopia when we went there it was a
[38:05] woman that god used
[38:08] to help us get to very many people
[38:11] and
[38:12] very many people believe
[38:14] so i still believe even now god
[38:19] can change very many people in that area
[38:21] there is no message chat in that area
[38:23] god can change very many you've already
[38:25] had that many work within regulators two
[38:27] pastors have already called me they have
[38:29] communicated with me
[38:31] and they are willing to meet with us so
[38:33] let's pray that when the time comes for
[38:35] us to go there
[38:37] it will yield for you hallelujah
[38:39] and i want to say that
[38:41] whoever will believe there
[38:43] either directly or indirectly it is
[38:45] afraid of diseased by muslims
[38:48] right
[38:49] yes so this is not in vain
[38:52] amen
[38:53] so we are waiting also for testimony
[38:54] some of you going there
[38:56] giving trust just giving up rights tell
[38:58] you there's a message there's a message
[39:01] you know they were reading those tracks
[39:02] out there then they would call me and
[39:04] ask me because of that tracks i would
[39:06] also ask for literature about
[39:08] sap and seed water baptism body
[39:12] you know
[39:21] you know so they will read and ask you
[39:23] understand and now we are making these
[39:25] books here the ones we are printing

[39:29] hallelujah it just be so wonderful so we
[39:32] just give them out everywhere among
[39:33] those people and you know i'm just on
[39:36] fire when i see god bringing in people
[39:38] to receive this world you know sooner
[39:40] soon very soon we are living in this old
[39:42] one so where will we go if we are not
[39:44] prepared ourselves first of all we need
[39:46] to prepare ourselves and prepare others
[39:48] also
[39:49] that are going to go with us where else
[39:50] you know it's just like going in a bus
[39:52] station
[39:53] and sitting down you are ready to go but
[39:57] people are not
[39:58] others are late so if they are late
[40:00] you're also going to remain in the bus
[40:02] around for one hour or two hours until
[40:04] everybody comes and joins you and then
[40:06] the battle starts
[40:08] so don't ever think you're going to
[40:10] interrupt before everybody else comes in

[40:13] member of the building press has to come

[42:42] here's like
[42:57] well there were five eastern nations

[43:16] right yeah
[43:18] [Music]
[43:38] revelation 2 23 23 and i will kill her
[43:42] children with death and all the churches
[43:45] shall know that i am he which searcheth
[43:47] the reigns and hearts and i will give
[43:49] unto every one of you according to your
[43:51] works
[43:52] god looketh on the heart
[43:55] that has never changed
[43:57] neither will it ever change
[43:59] here is through all the ages there are
[44:09] just a moment
[44:18] revelation 2 23
[44:21] and i will kill her children with death
[44:24] all the churches shall know that i am he
[44:26] which searcheth
[44:29] and i will give unto every one of you
[44:31] according to your works
[44:35] that has never changed
[44:36] neither will it
[44:38] change here as through all the ages
[44:40] there are two groups both proclaiming
[44:42] their revelation from god and their
[44:44] relationship to god
[44:46] nevertheless the foundation of god
[44:48] standeth sure having this seal the lord
[44:51] knoweth them which are his
[44:53] second timothy 2 19
[44:56] the lord searcheth the reigns
[44:58] the word search means to track or follow
[45:01] up
[45:02] god tracks down our thoughts
[45:04] reigns he knows what is in our hearts
[45:07] he sees our works which are a definite
[45:09] manifestation of what lies within us
[45:11] it is out of the heart that precedes
[45:13] either righteousness or wickedness
[45:15] our motives our purposes
[45:17] all are known unto him as he watches
[45:20] every action
[45:21] and every action
[45:23] every word shall be a judgment when the
[45:24] accounting for our lives is given
[45:27] do you see that
[45:29] he knows what is in our hearts
[45:32] and sees
[45:34] our works
[45:35] which are
[45:36] a definite manifestation of what lies
[45:38] within us
[45:40] i want us to understand this question
[45:41] please
[45:43] giving your
[45:45] attention to it can i can you put it on
[45:47] the screen
[45:48] what i'm sharing here
[45:53] the project of this
[45:56] okay
[46:02] okay everybody can see that
[46:06] okay
[46:07] he says god tracks down our thoughts
[46:11] our reigns
[46:13] thoughts
[46:15] he knows what is in our hearts
[46:19] sister
[46:20] are we together
[46:22] you're missing out
[46:23] i want you to concentrate
[46:25] he says god knows what is in our hearts
[46:28] god knows what you're thinking
[46:31] god knows what is in you
[46:34] he sees our works which are a definite
[46:36] manifestation of what lies within us
[46:39] did you know
[46:41] that the things you do
[46:43] is a proper manifestation of who you are
[46:47] you cannot say
[46:49] i am doing this but actually i am not
[46:52] like that
[46:54] you might see me
[46:55] painting myself but i am a believer
[46:59] you might see me wearing a mini skirt
[47:01] but actually
[47:02] i believe in my heart
[47:04] that's a lie
[47:06] because
[47:08] jesus said it is not what goes in a man
[47:13] that does what
[47:15] you find him
[47:16] it is what defines the man
[47:19] what comes up
[47:22] you
[47:22] understand when you eat the food it is
[47:25] all good
[47:27] but when you vomit it that's when we
[47:29] shall know what is in you
[47:31] no one will want to come near that food
[47:32] which you are vomiting
[47:35] right
[47:36] so what am i trying to say
[47:38] what you do on the outside
[47:41] shows what is on the inside
[47:45] you cannot do something bad
[47:48] and you are good
[47:50] it is impossible you cannot dress badly
[47:54] and you are a christian it is impossible
[47:57] you cannot treat others in a negative
[48:00] way when in your heart you are good but
[48:02] i meant well my heart was good and yet
[48:04] you are treating others it is a clear
[48:06] sign that even in inside you you are bad
[48:09] you are what is coming out of you shows
[48:12] what is in you
[48:14] that's why when we are preaching in this
[48:16] message
[48:17] we don't want to see the change on the
[48:19] outside
[48:20] we have had very many people having a
[48:22] change on the outside they dress like
[48:24] stains
[48:25] they talk and i say
[48:27] oh
[48:28] they just you know when they kind of
[48:30] pretend that they love you you think i
[48:31] am rich this is heaven for me
[48:34] but straight from their toys
[48:38] what does it mean to step on your toy
[48:40] but the banana uses that phrase very
[48:42] many times it simply means let someone
[48:44] annoy you
[48:45] then you will show them your two colors
[48:48] let someone do something that is bad
[48:51] that you don't like
[48:53] and then you will now open yourself
[48:55] clearly you will show them your true
[48:56] colors
[48:57] you will show them revenge
[49:00] you will show them hatred you will show
[49:02] them uh
[49:03] you know things like that speaking of
[49:05] goddamn revenge
[49:07] children of god don't do something to
[49:08] hurt another one because they hurt you
[49:11] children of body don't do something
[49:13] because someone has done bad therefore
[49:14] let
[49:18] it is a clear sign
[49:20] you are you yourself you are not changed
[49:21] you are worse
[49:23] than they are
[49:25] a person who is bad is the one who
[49:26] claims to be good and yet he has he's
[49:28] not good that one is even bad but at
[49:30] least the one who is bad and he knows
[49:32] he's bad and he doesn't claim to be good
[49:34] that one is okay he can literally get it
[49:35] in a moment
[49:37] but the one who claims to be good and is
[49:39] actually bad is a very very dangerous
[49:41] individual
[49:42] there are for my friends we are all bad
[49:44] by nature by bath
[49:46] and this world is supposed to make us
[49:48] good you cannot be good but only god
[49:51] make a good good by
[49:52] the power of his wife
[49:55] therefore
[49:56] what you do on the outside shows what
[49:58] you are on the inside you cannot claim
[50:00] to be good on the inside and you are
[50:02] treating others in a bad way you can't
[50:04] learn to be good on the inside and you
[50:06] don't love others you can't claim to
[50:09] even love god himself when you have love
[50:11] for your brethren and how can you claim
[50:12] to love your brethren when you cannot
[50:14] help them when they're in trouble and
[50:16] when you cannot be there for them when
[50:17] they need you then jesus himself said
[50:20] that if someone has a something and
[50:22] someone needs something and he comes to
[50:24] you and he says my brother i need you to
[50:26] help me i'm hungry and then you tell
[50:29] them may god bless you may he feel you
[50:31] may he make you prosper may you may he
[50:34] give you all the blessings
[50:37] there and then those people they go out
[50:39] there
[50:40] after you've blessed them and instead of
[50:42] you touch
[50:43] going down deep into your pocket and
[50:45] taking something and giving them you
[50:46] can't you have it and you can't and
[50:48] you're great to be a big christian that
[50:50] kind of percentage is not the true
[50:52] percentage that the government speaks of
[50:54] christianity you must be able to feel
[50:55] for others the things you do indeed show
[50:58] who you are are you hearing me
[51:00] so god tracks down our thoughts our
[51:02] reigns he knows what is in our hearts he
[51:04] sees our works which are a definite
[51:07] read with me now
[51:08] manifestation
[51:12] the ones i just write there i read it in
[51:14] red
[51:16] it
[51:17] sees our words come on now which are
[51:20] definitely
[51:22] of what lies within us
[51:25] it is out of the heart
[51:28] that proceeds in the righteousness
[51:33] out of that
[51:35] weekend
[51:37] our parties
[51:40] you can tell your dad or your mom or
[51:41] whoever it is that look at where to
[51:43] bible study but your motive he's not
[51:45] your bible said your mother exactly to
[51:47] go see a friend or your mother is after
[51:49] to go out somewhere and meet someone
[51:51] else
[51:52] that you are motive
[51:54] well of course you might say that but
[51:56] god sees your motive
[51:58] that's why many people even are not
[52:00] blessed for example you pay your tithe
[52:03] let me but now even what is making me
[52:04] poor even now is taking my money because
[52:06] you are and yet you are paying tight
[52:08] don't they ever expect god to bless you
[52:10] out of that because you are your mother
[52:12] is not right
[52:14] some of you even pay tithe to be rich
[52:17] if you're better experienced you will
[52:18] always be poor let me put let me tell
[52:20] you that
[52:21] god sees your motive why are you doing
[52:23] something
[52:24] better play type or give to others or
[52:27] give offering
[52:29] for the lord
[52:30] out of the abundance of your heart
[52:33] for the love of god
[52:34] you do it because you love him that's
[52:36] why the bible says that god loves a
[52:38] cheerful
[52:39] forgiver who is a cheerful giver the one
[52:41] who gives when they happen
[52:44] not again now they have taken even that
[52:46] one
[52:48] after you have given
[52:50] and indeed you think you are a cheerful
[52:52] giver and shall forgive us all who gives
[52:54] and feel so nice and happy
[52:56] oh
[52:57] you give someone an oh they're happy
[52:59] you're like oh praise the lord yeah that
[53:01] feels so good huh
[53:03] yeah but it's a natural thing you can't
[53:04] even make it up
[53:06] you can't even make it up if you don't
[53:08] have that ask god to give it to you ask
[53:10] me to feed you the one of us you will
[53:11] have it naturally i mean when
[53:19] you know
[53:20] then god will see that and he wants you
[53:23] hallelujah he blesses you it makes you
[53:25] to prosper when you give to the lord you
[53:28] give
[53:29] your free
[53:30] when you do something you do it
[53:32] cheerfully when you help others you do
[53:34] it cheerfully
[53:35] you understand yes god says our purpose
[53:38] says why are you doing what you are
[53:39] doing
[53:40] oh you're doing it so that they can know
[53:42] that you can do it or you're doing it so
[53:43] that they can know that you're good or
[53:44] you're doing it so they can't know you
[53:46] know
[53:47] you know i was talking with some brother
[53:48] today about giving you know when you are
[53:51] giving someone don't expect to receive
[53:54] game knowing that you are doing good
[53:56] you're cheerful you're doing good for
[53:57] the glory of the name of our god
[54:00] all are known unto him as he watches
[54:02] every action there is nothing you are
[54:04] going to do to deceive any man you can
[54:06] receive man right but you cannot deceive
[54:08] god god cannot be deceived even the
[54:10] bible says god cannot be mocked have you
[54:13] not read that scripture before god
[54:14] cannot be mocked therefore when you are
[54:17] doing something
[54:18] when you are coming for the bible
[54:20] saturday here when you are going for
[54:22] prayer like some of you were in the
[54:23] church today when you're doing anything
[54:25] for the lord or even for your brothers
[54:27] and sisters don't ever think that you
[54:28] are going to mock god god knows your
[54:30] every action there is nothing he does
[54:32] not
[54:33] and he started the reigns at the heart
[54:34] he knows what is in your heart
[54:37] and every action and every word shall be
[54:39] brought into judgment when the
[54:41] accounting for our lives is given why
[54:43] did you do what you did you were asking
[54:46] do you can you give accountability for
[54:48] your action
[54:49] you know i was thinking it is easy to
[54:51] give someone
[54:52] it is easier for you to receive any
[54:54] amount of money right
[54:56] but it is very hard for you to account
[54:58] for it
[55:00] i've often seen that among the young
[55:02] people raise you give them 10 or twenty
[55:05] or a hundred thousand or two hundred
[55:07] thousand and then tell them give me
[55:08] accountability afterwards it's like as
[55:10] if you have beaten them
[55:14] how could you do that
[55:16] but yet it is easy for you to receive it
[55:19] so god has given you all your life
[55:21] god has given you life he has given you
[55:23] help
[55:24] he has given you all you needed to be
[55:26] alive
[55:27] and now that you have what you have
[55:30] god is going to one day put you to
[55:32] accountability whatever you gave
[55:36] did you ever realize that
[55:38] the life you have you're going to
[55:39] account for it
[55:40] the things you do you're going to
[55:41] account for them
[55:46] everyone shall be brought into judgment
[55:48] even everyone you speak
[55:50] shall be brought to judgment everywhere
[55:53] when accounting for our lives is given
[55:55] there was no fear of god before the
[55:57] false vine and the dearly and
[56:00] theory shall they pray
[56:02] the first value will beat the eye
[56:04] they are petty eyes why
[56:07] why
[56:08] because
[56:09] there was no fear of god before them
[56:13] that's why we are should not go when we
[56:14] do things
[56:28] you know some people do things without a
[56:30] fear of god at all
[56:33] not the fear of god at all
[56:37] but let me tell you if you don't have
[56:38] the fear of god in your heart you're a
[56:39] force fight and if you're forced by that
[56:42] it means you are
[56:44] i'm sorry to say stop and see
[56:46] but i'm glad i'm talking to the seed of
[56:49] god
[56:51] amen if you know something is wrong and
[56:53] you are going to do it maybe you even
[56:56] let up your mind let me do it today help
[56:58] me but i slightly cold
[57:01] then you guys let me do it but let me
[57:03] tell you if you're a child of god
[57:05] immediately something will build up in
[57:07] your heart
[57:09] then if you will feel fear from nowhere
[57:11] ah i can't do it on my chest i just
[57:14] can't do it i just can't do it
[57:16] what is happening because you're a child
[57:19] of god
[57:20] you are true fine
[57:22] he will not let you do it he will put
[57:24] that fear that's why but
[57:26] a man had to fight his way to hell
[57:31] i'm not going to fight his way to hell
[57:33] did you know for you to go ahead you
[57:35] have to fight so much
[57:37] you fight with the angel of the lord
[57:40] he tells you no he puts fear on you
[57:44] no come on you can't wear that clouds
[57:47] are you a child oh god yes
[57:49] remember you're like ah why did you say
[57:52] god no
[58:07] then the fear of god will come here
[58:10] and then
[58:12] to clear out that point if you don't
[58:14] have the holy ghost
[58:16] you just go right ahead
[58:18] you will pass all the barricades and
[58:20] that's what it means grace we are served
[58:22] by grace
[58:24] because
[58:25] some of us did those things by unbelief
[58:28] but the grace brought us out of the
[58:29] world
[58:31] and grace he did not count as if we did
[58:34] anything
[58:36] you forgive us
[58:37] amen he wash us with his blood and then

[1:06:00] because the lord knows all things he

[1:06:39] he knows all about me
[1:06:44] yes gold
[1:06:52] [Music]

[1:07:02] [Music]
[1:07:04] [Applause]
[1:07:07] oh he's willing to help
[1:07:10] me
[1:07:12] or if
[1:07:15] [Music]
[1:07:26] never forget that
[1:07:28] let us look at the promise of us that
[1:07:30] days in revelation
[1:07:32] revelation 2
[1:07:34] 24-25
[1:07:35] but unto you i say and unto the rest in
[1:07:38] thyatira as many as have not this
[1:07:40] doctrine and which have not known the
[1:07:42] depth of satan as they speak
[1:07:44] i will put upon you none other burden
[1:07:47] but that which ye have already hold fast
[1:07:49] till i come
[1:07:50] now before we go into the promise let me
[1:07:52] show again that the church as spoken of
[1:07:54] by the spirit in this book has two vines
[1:07:57] whose interwinding branches compose it
[1:08:00] but i say unto you and unto the rest in
[1:08:02] thyatira as many as have not this
[1:08:04] doctrine
[1:08:05] there it is
[1:08:07] he is speaking to the two groups
[1:08:09] one has the doctrine another has not
[1:08:12] there they are scattered abroad across
[1:08:14] the nations with each one's doctrine
[1:08:15] opposing the other
[1:08:17] one is of god knowing his depths the
[1:08:19] other of satan knowing the depths of
[1:08:21] satan
[1:08:23] i will put upon you none other burden
[1:08:26] the word for burden is weight or
[1:08:28] pressure
[1:08:29] the pressure of the dark ages was either
[1:08:31] bend or be broken
[1:08:33] bow or die
[1:08:34] it was the inquisition the power of the
[1:08:36] empire backing up satanic worship
[1:08:39] be organized or pay with your life
[1:08:41] each age had its pressures
[1:08:43] for example a great burden of the last
[1:08:45] age is the pressure of riches soft
[1:08:48] living and nervous tensions in a complex
[1:08:50] age that we seem unfitted to live in
[1:08:53] this fourth age seems to have had a
[1:08:55] clear-cut burden
[1:08:57] it was to defy rome stand up for the
[1:08:59] word even unto death
[1:09:01] they have not known the depths of satan
[1:09:05] it seems that this verse has been left
[1:09:07] out by the commentators for they were
[1:09:08] not able to figure out what doctrine or
[1:09:10] what experiences are meant by this
[1:09:12] phrase
[1:09:14] before we continue down here it says
[1:09:15] that each age
[1:09:17] up here
[1:09:22] uh
[1:09:22] [Music]
[1:09:24] yeah
[1:09:26] no one i knew that i may miss it so i
[1:09:27] had to go there immediately
[1:09:29] why does it talk about this age
[1:09:32] each ads right here
[1:09:35] yes it says
[1:09:37] each age had expressions
[1:09:40] for example a great burden of the last
[1:09:43] age this is our age that we are living
[1:09:45] in
[1:09:47] is the pressure of riches
[1:09:49] did you know that
[1:09:51] that you know the
[1:09:52] the edges we have been through every age
[1:09:54] that is precious what is the pressure of
[1:09:56] the edge of saturn
[1:10:01] ah
[1:10:04] no no
[1:10:06] what is the age of the altera what what
[1:10:07] what did the believers in the in saturn
[1:10:09] face
[1:10:13] ah
[1:10:16] join the nomination
[1:10:18] or die that was their pressure
[1:10:20] they persecuted them to join their
[1:10:23] organized religion
[1:10:25] they joined that organized religion the
[1:10:26] catholic church or they died the time of
[1:10:29] the inquisition we we talked about it we
[1:10:31] read that i think about the last time
[1:10:33] what was the time of the imposition the
[1:10:35] time of the inquisition was when
[1:10:38] they say that they established an
[1:10:40] organization where
[1:10:42] by if you do not join if you do not
[1:10:45] uh
[1:10:46] believe what the church is doing you are
[1:10:48] called you are called a heretic
[1:10:51] i heard it was a person who
[1:10:53] actually i i to do heresy is to believe
[1:10:56] first doctrine right so if you are
[1:10:58] considered and erected by the judge
[1:11:01] you will be killed it would matter you
[1:11:03] don't kill you so you either check them
[1:11:05] or you die that was the pressure that
[1:11:07] they had but the pressure we have today
[1:11:09] if you can enjoy any church you want to
[1:11:11] join you can be anywhere you want to be
[1:11:12] you can even stay home for all your life
[1:11:15] that's no problem you may even know to
[1:11:17] go to church that's up to you if you you
[1:11:19] know it's a generation of rights
[1:11:21] here
[1:11:22] right it's your right
[1:11:25] to stay at home it's your right to go to
[1:11:26] church huh it's your right to go to
[1:11:28] school if you don't want to go to school
[1:11:29] by the way it's you're right
[1:11:31] you don't know that it's all right you
[1:11:33] can just go out to court and say well i
[1:11:34] don't have to go to school as long as as
[1:11:36] long as
[1:11:37] it's your right you know but of course
[1:11:39] the country also has goals whereby
[1:11:41] you have to have education up to this
[1:11:43] level or that kind of label after that
[1:11:45] you say when's my right i don't want to
[1:11:46] go to university
[1:11:48] no one will take me there so right
[1:11:50] and
[1:11:51] and many even the united states don't
[1:11:53] get education they don't work it's the
[1:11:56] right can imagine it's their right and
[1:11:58] the government gives them what we need
[1:12:00] and imagine
[1:12:02] the our generation is rewarding even
[1:12:03] lessons so it's the right it's our this
[1:12:06] is the generation of rights what are you
[1:12:08] going to say me i don't want to marry a
[1:12:10] a a woman i want to marry a man it's
[1:12:12] right
[1:12:14] i don't want to marry a woman i'm a man
[1:12:16] i'm a woman but i want to marry a woman
[1:12:18] they're doing it everywhere it's their
[1:12:20] right but also it will be their right to
[1:12:23] go to hell of course
[1:12:25] but you as a believer you also have
[1:12:27] rights
[1:12:29] it's our right to overcome the pressures
[1:12:30] of our age
[1:12:32] and nobody no one should look in front
[1:12:35] of you i tell you you cannot
[1:12:38] it is you are right to overcome it if
[1:12:39] they want to do it you don't want to do
[1:12:41] it and it is also your right they should
[1:12:43] respect it
[1:12:44] hallelujah what's the pressure of our
[1:12:47] age which is the last age soft living
[1:12:51] another extensions
[1:12:54] in a complex age that we seem
[1:12:57] undefeated to live in
[1:13:01] the fourth age seems okay well of course
[1:13:03] all right before i get there to the
[1:13:05] fourth edge here it says for example the
[1:13:07] great battle of the last ages the
[1:13:09] pressure of riches
[1:13:11] reaches
[1:13:12] that's why all titles are prophesying
[1:13:13] people rangers rachel can't immediately
[1:13:15] launch
[1:13:16] here
[1:13:20] [Music]
[1:13:31] people are leaving others to train
[1:13:32] others all in the name of riches
[1:13:35] people are leaving their countries to go
[1:13:36] in arab camps or in the name of riches
[1:13:39] not that they don't have what to eat
[1:13:41] they have what to eat they are not going
[1:13:42] to sleep but they want to be rich they
[1:13:46] want to be like so and so they want to
[1:13:47] drive like so and so and they don't want
[1:13:49] to just drive a car they just want to
[1:13:50] have a real car like like somebody they
[1:13:53] don't want to just have a house they
[1:13:54] want to have a real house like somebody
[1:13:55] they don't want to just have you
[1:13:57] understand these kind of things so this
[1:13:59] is the pressure of our generation please
[1:14:02] let us overcome this pressure
[1:14:05] let us overcome the pressure from this
[1:14:07] direction to be rich let us overcome the
[1:14:09] pressure for self-leaving
[1:14:12] let us overcome the pressures from our
[1:14:13] perceptions we find people going with
[1:14:16] those people because they're nervous
[1:14:18] they're crazy they become crazy because
[1:14:19] they're nervous
[1:14:20] it is the pressures of the breath the
[1:14:22] pressures of the generation and the
[1:14:24] fourth age also
[1:14:26] had a
[1:14:39] actually it is simple to know what is
[1:14:41] meant
[1:14:42] let us first know what the depth of god
[1:14:44] is and the opposite will be true for the
[1:14:46] depth of satan
[1:14:48] in ephesians 3 16
[1:14:50] that he would grant you according to the
[1:14:52] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[1:14:55] with might by his spirit in the inner
[1:14:57] man that christ may dwell in your hearts
[1:14:59] by faith
[1:15:00] that ye being rooted and grounded in
[1:15:02] love may be able to comprehend with all
[1:15:05] saints what is the breadth and length
[1:15:07] and depth and height and to know the
[1:15:09] love of christ which passeth knowledge
[1:15:12] that ye might be filled with all the
[1:15:14] fullness of god
[1:15:15] now according to these verses when a man
[1:15:18] experiences the depth of god in his life
[1:15:20] it is an actual personal experience of
[1:15:22] the spirit of god indwelling him and his
[1:15:25] mind is illuminated by the wisdom and
[1:15:27] knowledge of god through the word
[1:15:29] but the depth of satan will be and that
[1:15:31] he will attempt to destroy this
[1:15:34] he will as always attempt to make a
[1:15:35] substitute for this reality of god how
[1:15:38] will he do it
[1:15:40] he will take away the knowledge of the
[1:15:41] truth of god destroy the word by putting
[1:15:44] forth his own
[1:15:45] yea hath god said
[1:15:47] he will then substitute the personal
[1:15:49] christ in our spirits
[1:15:51] he will do it as he caused israel to do
[1:15:53] the same
[1:15:54] by a human being reigning as king
[1:15:56] instead of god
[1:15:57] the born-again experience will be
[1:15:59] rejected in favor of church joining the
[1:16:01] depths of satan had been entered into in
[1:16:04] that age
[1:16:05] and the fruit of that depth of satan
[1:16:07] which are lies murders and horrible
[1:16:09] crimes came forth from it
[1:16:12] the rewards
[1:16:14] revelation 2 26-29
[1:16:18] and he that overcometh and keepeth my
[1:16:20] works unto the end to him will i give
[1:16:23] power over the nations
[1:16:24] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[1:16:26] iron
[1:16:28] potter shall they be broken
[1:16:30] even as i received of my father and i
[1:16:33] will give him the morning star
[1:16:35] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:16:37] the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:16:40] he that overcometh and keepeth my works
[1:16:42] to the end
[1:16:44] it is very evident from the remarks of
[1:16:46] the spirit on works that the lord is
[1:16:48] trying to get his own to see his opinion
[1:16:50] of righteous works
[1:16:52] four times he mentions works
[1:16:54] and now he says that he who keeps doing
[1:16:57] his works faithfully until the end will
[1:16:59] be given power over nations and will be
[1:17:01] a strong capable unbending ruler who can
[1:17:04] cope so powerfully with any situation
[1:17:07] that even the most desperate enemy will
[1:17:08] be broken if need be
[1:17:11] his demonstration of rule by power will
[1:17:13] be like unto the very sons
[1:17:15] this is very amazing
[1:17:17] but let us look at this promise in the
[1:17:19] light of the age
[1:17:20] powerful rome with state backing
[1:17:22] employing kings and armies and
[1:17:24] legislators breaks and grinds all before
[1:17:27] it she has killed millions and hungers
[1:17:29] to kill millions more who will not bow
[1:17:31] to her
[1:17:32] she intolerantly sets up kings or brings
[1:17:34] them low whenever she can
[1:17:36] yea her interference has actually caused
[1:17:38] nations to fall because she has
[1:17:40] determined to destroy the elect of god
[1:17:43] her works are the works of the devil for
[1:17:46] she murders and lies as did he
[1:17:48] but there is coming a day wherein the
[1:17:50] lord is going to say
[1:17:52] bring these mine enemies before me and
[1:17:54] slay them
[1:17:55] then shall the righteous be with their
[1:17:57] lord when his righteous indignation will
[1:17:59] fall upon the blasphemers
[1:18:01] the righteous coming with him in glory
[1:18:02] shall destroy those who destroyed the
[1:18:04] earth and made havoc of the saints of
[1:18:06] god
[1:18:08] this was the age of turning the cheek of
[1:18:10] terrible distress but a day is coming
[1:18:12] when truth shall prevail and who shall
[1:18:14] stand in its fire and be safe
[1:18:17] only the redeemed of the lord
[1:18:20] and i will give him the morning star
[1:18:23] according to revelation 22 16
[1:18:26] and 2 peter 1 19
[1:18:29] jesus is the morning star
[1:18:31] i am the root and offspring of david the
[1:18:33] bright and morning star
[1:18:35] until the day dawn and the day star
[1:18:37] arise in your hearts the spirit is
[1:18:40] therefore making a promise to the elect
[1:18:42] of the dark ages relative to himself and
[1:18:44] then in the ages to come
[1:18:47] as we have already stated
[1:18:49] jesus identifies himself with the
[1:18:51] messengers of each age
[1:18:53] they receive from him the revelation on
[1:18:54] the word for each period
[1:18:56] this word revelation brings the elect of
[1:18:58] god out of the world and into full union
[1:19:01] with jesus christ
[1:19:02] these messengers are called stars
[1:19:05] because they shine with a borrowed or
[1:19:06] reflected light of the sun even jesus
[1:19:09] they are also called stars because they
[1:19:11] are holders of light at night
[1:19:14] thus in the darkness of sin they bring
[1:19:16] the light of god to his people
[1:19:19] this is the dark ages it is especially
[1:19:22] dark for the word of the lord is almost
[1:19:24] entirely hidden from the people that's
[1:19:26] right knowledge of the most high has
[1:19:28] almost ceased
[1:19:30] death has overcome vast numbers of the
[1:19:31] believers until their ranks are
[1:19:33] decimated
[1:19:34] the things of god are at the lowest ebb
[1:19:36] to this date and it seemed that satan
[1:19:39] would surely conquer god's people
[1:19:42] if ever a people needed a promise
[1:19:43] embracing the land where there is no
[1:19:45] light it was the people of the dark ages
[1:19:48] and that is why the spirit is promising
[1:19:50] them the morning star
[1:19:52] he is telling them that the chief star
[1:19:54] even jesus who dwelleth in light unto
[1:19:56] which no man will continue what's the
[1:19:58] dark ages which generation among all the
[1:20:00] churches
[1:20:04] why
[1:20:07] why
[1:20:10] it's unfollowing
[1:20:12] but you can't discuss
[1:20:14] this is a bible study it's not a
[1:20:15] preaching moment so i'm not preaching to
[1:20:17] you
[1:20:18] i want us to contribute
[1:20:24] sorry
[1:20:28] yes
[1:20:30] what what why why else
[1:20:41] okay it says that this is the dark edges
[1:20:44] it is especially dark for the word of
[1:20:45] the lord is almost entirely hidden from
[1:20:51] because remember
[1:20:53] in that tattoo actually even was it on
[1:20:55] the longest age
[1:20:59] very long time over over a thousand
[1:21:01] years
[1:21:03] where the the trinity doctrine was
[1:21:05] preached as a
[1:21:06] as the true doctrine
[1:21:08] imagined
[1:21:10] where the people were killed for simply
[1:21:13] going against the catholic church
[1:21:15] where no one was allowed
[1:21:18] to preach but only the priests
[1:21:21] where the denomination had already
[1:21:23] established and was killing anyone who
[1:21:26] went against you
[1:21:29] the one of god was almost hidden from
[1:21:30] the people
[1:21:33] knowledge of the most high
[1:21:35] knowledge of jesus christ was almost
[1:21:37] seized the truth was no longer preached
[1:21:40] you
[1:21:40] understand data has overcome vast
[1:21:43] numbers of the believers until their
[1:21:45] rights are dismissed
[1:21:48] vast numbers of believers
[1:21:49] so that means decimated meaning until
[1:21:51] all of them are killed all the other of
[1:21:53] them are almost wiped out you understand
[1:21:57] the things of god are the lowest
[1:22:00] aim to this day
[1:22:02] and it seemed that saturn would be sure
[1:22:04] to conquer these people it seemed as if
[1:22:06] the devil had the people of god in his
[1:22:08] hands some of you
[1:22:09] were having a
[1:22:12] no but you didn't have an overnight you
[1:22:14] you always have to half day
[1:22:16] uh
[1:22:18] i i don't know why some of you are
[1:22:20] announcing if you're doing please stand
[1:22:22] up
[1:22:26] all right so
[1:22:28] then
[1:22:29] it says again here if ever our people
[1:22:31] needed a promise
[1:22:34] embracing the land where there is no
[1:22:37] night it was the people of the darker
[1:22:39] ages
[1:22:40] and that is why the spirit is promising
[1:22:42] them the morning star
[1:22:44] he is telling them that the chief staff
[1:22:46] even jesus
[1:22:48] who beareth in light and to which no man
[1:22:51] can approach
[1:22:52] will in the future kingdom illuminate
[1:22:54] them
[1:22:55] by his own personal presence he will not
[1:22:58] be using the stars or messengers to give
[1:23:01] light in darkness any longer it will be
[1:23:04] jesus
[1:23:05] himself speaking to them face to face as
[1:23:08] he shares his kingdom with them some of
[1:23:11] these songs came during these days
[1:23:14] in a city where
[1:23:15] there's a light the city where
[1:23:32] [Music]
[1:23:33] and there's another shall be right in
[1:23:35] the evening time
[1:23:36] you know
[1:23:38] this
[1:23:38] during this man right now most of these
[1:23:40] songs we've seen but some of these we
[1:23:41] are going to give you these edges
[1:23:44] because they were going through
[1:23:45] situations difficult situations
[1:23:48] the great songs out of it the british
[1:23:51] comes out of it that's how we see that
[1:23:53] this holy ghost goes fair
[1:23:57] is dripping with blood
[1:24:00] the
[1:24:08] [Applause]
[1:24:15] what who is the souls these brothers
[1:24:17] were suffering dying
[1:24:19] they would drink these things and then
[1:24:21] with the ink you know
[1:24:23] with ink and and and they
[1:24:25] have
[1:24:26] all
[1:24:27] you know roster feathers
[1:24:29] will use feathers and an ink to rank
[1:24:31] these things so that they can preserve
[1:24:32] it so that you and i can be able to be a
[1:24:35] beneficiary of it
[1:24:36] because they went through it they
[1:24:38] suffered they died because of this
[1:24:40] message
[1:24:42] and here we are now we have all the
[1:24:44] freedom we can have to preach what we
[1:24:46] want to preach to believe what we want
[1:24:47] to believe and we don't do it
[1:24:50] and not believe it
[1:24:53] and we're not seeing it with it
[1:24:56] how are you going to start with those
[1:24:57] who suffered and died for it tell me
[1:25:01] if you are not serious for it but yeah
[1:25:03] there are some others who died for it
[1:25:05] how can you stand together and say you
[1:25:07] will be the same rapture
[1:25:08] is it even possible
[1:25:10] so how serious must you be in this
[1:25:12] generation
[1:25:13] this year
[1:25:15] and that is why the spirit is promising
[1:25:17] them the morning star
[1:25:18] where of course jesus christ is the
[1:25:20] morning star
[1:25:22] he's telling them that the chief star
[1:25:23] even jesus
[1:25:24] who dwelt in light unto which no man can
[1:25:27] approach will in the future keep them
[1:25:29] eliminate them by his own personal
[1:25:31] presence
[1:25:33] hallelujah
[1:25:34] praise the name
[1:25:37] will in the future kingdom illuminate
[1:25:39] them by his own personal presence
[1:25:41] he will not be using the stars
[1:25:43] messengers to give light in darkness any
[1:25:46] longer
[1:25:47] it will be jesus himself speaking to
[1:25:49] them face to face as he shares his
[1:25:51] kingdom with them
[1:25:53] it is the morning star that is visible
[1:25:55] when the light of the sun commences to
[1:25:57] shine
[1:25:58] when our sun
[1:25:59] jesus comes there will be no further
[1:26:01] need of messengers
[1:26:03] he will bring us his message of cheer
[1:26:04] himself
[1:26:06] and as he rules his kingdom and we live
[1:26:08] in his presence the light of the word
[1:26:10] will become brighter and brighter in our
[1:26:12] perfect day
[1:26:15] of jesus himself
[1:26:17] is he not everything even perfect
[1:26:19] everything
[1:26:21] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:26:23] the spirit
[1:26:24] so someone who wrote ourselves

[1:31:59] why can't you deceive each of them

[1:32:03] you cannot receive god
[1:32:07] yes you have seen that from the turtle
[1:32:09] church age right yes okay
[1:32:15] then you cannot receive the devil
[1:32:17] because
[1:32:19] the devil is the father of life
[1:32:27] so he's a father of lies himself
[1:32:29] his experience in life is the father of
[1:32:31] it he's the one who makes it up
[1:32:34] all right go ahead
[1:32:36] and
[1:32:37] when
[1:32:38] because
[1:32:44] you're going to continue many people
[1:32:45] don't fear lies let me tell you if you
[1:32:47] don't fear to lie and you're a believer
[1:32:50] you you are in a very sort of state
[1:32:54] telling lies
[1:32:55] telling lies means you are
[1:32:57] an associate of the devil
[1:33:00] you you know
[1:33:01] you are false witness the bible calls it
[1:33:04] never tell lies always say the truth
[1:33:07] speak the truth
[1:33:09] the bible says the truth shall set you
[1:33:11] free
[1:33:12] even if you have done something so wrong
[1:33:14] and you know when you say the truth it
[1:33:16] will lead you to problems say it
[1:33:19] and god will stand with you so brother
[1:33:22] those are two people you can't lie
[1:33:24] yourself
[1:33:25] then yourself
[1:33:26] then then you can fly god the devil too
[1:33:30] oh yeah you're the one told us about you
[1:33:32] cannot lie that therefore you got like
[1:33:34] god and then you don't like the devil
[1:33:36] yourself oh yes
[1:33:37] how can you like yourself
[1:33:40] because
[1:33:43] because
[1:33:44] the devil is
[1:33:45] so
[1:33:46] obviously
[1:33:48] you know you will obviously know that
[1:33:49] indeed the devil spoke to me not god god
[1:33:52] bless you god bless you so much my
[1:33:53] brother see this young man has really
[1:33:55] given us a very good lesson this is a
[1:33:57] very good thing that he has learned out
[1:33:59] of the fact
[1:34:00] hallelujah always beef true witness god
[1:34:04] knows everything in your heart god sees
[1:34:06] it god knows he can search the reigns of
[1:34:09] your heart therefore if you want to be a
[1:34:11] christian be a good christian if you
[1:34:13] want to be a beautiful man if you want
[1:34:15] to be a person to be
[1:34:45] [Music]
[1:34:55] a christian then be the best
[1:35:09] and you say you're going to receive good
[1:35:10] blessings out of each decision you will
[1:35:13] make
[1:35:14] if you are going to christian god is
[1:35:16] going to bless you amen if you are a
[1:35:18] good worldly person the devil is going
[1:35:20] to bless you so which way take the
[1:35:22] blessing of the of the one but some put
[1:35:24] one leg in
[1:35:25] in the wild
[1:35:27] god can't bless them and they put one
[1:35:28] leg in it
[1:35:30] in the road
[1:35:32] then the devil can also trust them so
[1:35:34] they never can trust you god can trust
[1:35:36] him so we will trust him
[1:35:39] so the devil will use you and god will
[1:35:41] what god will anoint you only because if
[1:35:43] you come under the anointing when the
[1:35:45] word of god is there the god will turn
[1:35:47] to you
[1:35:49] it's just an anointing but actually
[1:35:51] i'm using you many times so you would
[1:35:52] just be that they don't want to use you
[1:35:54] but you won't also trust you so you
[1:35:56] better go there that they will trust you
[1:35:57] than to come in here and no one can
[1:36:00] trust you
[1:36:01] but i don't know about you but as for me
[1:36:03] i decided a long time ago to stand and
[1:36:06] let go trust me a hundred percent
[1:36:23] have you seen him have you seen him and
[1:36:25] that the devil will look down because he
[1:36:26] knows indeed
[1:36:28] that he cannot get do you know that he
[1:36:30] never knows there's some people we can't
[1:36:32] get
[1:36:33] do you know that
[1:36:34] they never know there's something we
[1:36:36] can't get to hear but he trains every
[1:36:38] day
[1:36:39] he tries every day to see how we can get
[1:36:41] to them but he knows he cannot
[1:36:43] but he tries every day checks in on them
[1:36:46] is there a girl
[1:36:48] especially those demons that were
[1:36:49] already walking through you know when
[1:36:51] you were born before you believe you
[1:36:52] know they never always would use them
[1:36:54] because they they are literally they
[1:36:55] know they know you very well so that
[1:36:57] they have had to experience with you so
[1:36:59] he will always send them
[1:37:01] hey go and check so they will come
[1:37:04] when
[1:37:18] they come
[1:37:37] to capture your attention so the devil
[1:37:39] will throw that word to see how you
[1:37:41] respond
[1:37:42] if you are a true christian you will say
[1:37:44] please don't call me that i am not
[1:37:46] comfortable with that just call me my
[1:37:48] name i i'm i'm comfortable with that
[1:37:51] then the other person i'm saying
[1:37:53] but he knows he knew he knew that he got
[1:37:56] something because he cannot lie he knew
[1:37:58] that the devil was using him to jump to
[1:37:59] you like that so when you throw a very
[1:38:01] strong word
[1:38:03] i'm sorry i didn't mean it
[1:38:04] then you are probably just immediately
[1:38:06] because the devil knows
[1:38:07] you will go back and give me the point
[1:38:09] the person is too strong
[1:38:11] the person is
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:38:42] bring my hand to demonstrate let us god
[1:38:45] attack hey our contact has resumed he
[1:38:48] was dead now he's alive
[1:38:49] and they will make a certain celebration
[1:38:51] in here he will come with thousands of
[1:38:53] demons to attack him before you know it
[1:38:55] you won't come out of him i was talking
[1:38:57] to one brother so how did you but i was
[1:38:59] like you see they're probably about
[1:39:01] happy i was hugging sisters not so much
[1:39:04] and one visitor is talking about
[1:39:06] neighbors
[1:39:25] amen
[1:39:26] if you know it is wrong to have
[1:39:28] the opposite sex when they are not your
[1:39:29] husband or wife why do you accept to do
[1:39:32] it or why do you accept someone just to
[1:39:33] be
[1:39:34] to you
[1:39:35] if you knew it is wrong
[1:39:37] if it is wrong definitely it will give
[1:39:38] you wrong feels
[1:39:40] therefore you can't deceive yourself you
[1:39:42] can't receive god you can't say that all
[1:39:44] these
[1:39:45] people are your partners somehow
[1:39:47] but let the devil be always
[1:39:51] means
[1:39:52] me our brother let the devil be a
[1:39:54] witness that he has seen who i am let
[1:39:57] him always be my witness to her
[1:40:01] let him always go back and tell all the
[1:40:03] other devils and hair itself that that
[1:40:05] guy you can't get him
[1:40:07] you know you know how the devil is
[1:40:08] fascinated when he always
[1:40:10] those demons which are assigned to you
[1:40:12] take back a negative report do you know
[1:40:14] how it fulfills all hell
[1:40:17] ah that young man oh you can't get you
[1:40:20] i've tried all my best
[1:40:22] what did you do i decided to go through
[1:40:25] all the friends i tried to go through it
[1:40:26] even when they were searching they got
[1:40:28] these bad videos it came but the person
[1:40:30] just put it off you know i tried i have
[1:40:33] failed to get him
[1:40:34] don't think that things happen by
[1:40:36] accident some of them they never bring
[1:40:37] them
[1:40:38] to you
[1:40:41] and the bible says you're not tempted by
[1:40:42] god you're tempted by your own lust
[1:40:46] so you see the devil knows how to get
[1:40:48] you
[1:40:49] there if i don't think that you can lie
[1:40:51] to yourself or god or the devil
[1:40:53] therefore be
[1:40:56] a walker with jesus christ to overcome
[1:40:59] the world to be a conqueror hallelujah
[1:41:01] and if you're going to be a believer be
[1:41:03] the best
[1:41:04] always be in prayer you know whether
[1:41:06] it's the prayer meeting at church go
[1:41:08] there
[1:41:09] on when is this some sisters go there
[1:41:10] for prayer so sisters if you want to
[1:41:12] also call people for prayer meetings you
[1:41:14] can always join them it's good
[1:41:16] you know
[1:41:17] [Music]
[1:41:28] if it comes to the word believe the word
[1:41:31] if it comes to
[1:41:32] you know uh with nursing and telling
[1:41:34] people about who you are don't hide some
[1:41:36] people they think they can be good
[1:41:37] crystals but hide it
[1:41:39] it means that you already failed before
[1:41:41] you have started
[1:41:43] if you have your very good friend this
[1:41:44] one is
[1:41:58] because if you don't want your some of
[1:42:00] your friends to know who you are or what
[1:42:02] you feel
[1:42:03] they will feel negative about you
[1:42:06] then it means that you are lacking
[1:42:08] somehow
[1:42:09] god bless you
[1:42:10] who else has something that they have
[1:42:12] learned right yes
[1:42:23] [Music]
[1:42:33] [Music]
[1:42:40] so that they can put them down something
[1:42:41] like that then i understood that
[1:42:44] the church is like
[1:42:46] a woman
[1:42:48] our father the church is like
[1:42:52] what is our father so we shouldn't
[1:42:54] the
[1:43:08] is amen
[1:43:11] have you seen that
[1:43:13] she has laughed that
[1:43:14] there is a wrong spirit of jezebel which
[1:43:16] is a dominating spirit
[1:43:19] whenever you see at any place or in any
[1:43:22] place
[1:43:22] you see
[1:43:24] a woman trying to dominate authority to
[1:43:26] dominate a man
[1:43:28] to rule the man
[1:43:30] that there is a wrong spirit there
[1:43:32] god has not intended for a woman
[1:43:34] to dominate over
[1:43:36] the men a woman should always be found
[1:43:40] in a position
[1:43:41] or place of humility
[1:43:45] what i say always wear
[1:43:46] in the church she should always be found
[1:43:48] in a place of humility
[1:43:50] not wanting to accept authority over men
[1:43:53] or to control them
[1:43:55] in the whole family you find sometimes
[1:43:58] your homes whereby it is almost women
[1:44:00] controlling men some of them you find
[1:44:02] them shouting at them at them and the
[1:44:04] man is creating like a slave
[1:44:06] if you ever get into that sister don't
[1:44:09] ever let that spirit enter you because
[1:44:11] the spirit of disability you find a
[1:44:13] woman controlling your hand like a
[1:44:15] remote
[1:44:16] you know a man has to call her and fear
[1:44:19] the man you know and fear the woman that
[1:44:21] is wrong it's not a good spirit the
[1:44:23] spirit of death are there
[1:44:25] and we find that same spirit
[1:44:27] also in the church
[1:44:29] the church is a woman
[1:44:32] the church must never control people
[1:44:34] oh if you've been following from the
[1:44:36] very beginning you have seen how god has
[1:44:39] been a
[1:44:40] blessing us through these church ages
[1:44:42] to see how a true church must always
[1:44:45] have two identifications number
[1:44:52] the true manifestation of the power of
[1:44:56] god hallelujah church now
[1:44:59] the man who controls the church
[1:45:03] but what has a man right
[1:45:05] and who is the man
[1:45:07] who is the man
[1:45:13] together
[1:45:14] who is the man that rules over the
[1:45:15] church
[1:45:19] who is the man that rules over the
[1:45:21] church one more time
[1:45:23] raise up your hand on
[1:45:25] one person raise up your hand
[1:45:27] because if you are giving a chorus
[1:45:29] answers yes bro
[1:45:33] okay right
[1:45:35] who is the man
[1:45:39] not fear brother who's the power who's
[1:45:41] the man
[1:45:48] who is the man
[1:45:50] the pastor right he said the pastor is
[1:45:52] the highest authority
[1:45:56] in the world
[1:45:58] we have very many offices in the church
[1:46:00] we have police for you know very closely
[1:46:03] we have the leak on board the trustees
[1:46:05] those ones who manage the money and
[1:46:07] everything and then the deacons who are
[1:46:09] like police officers and to ensure that
[1:46:11] the faith is kept and people who are
[1:46:13] trying to come and bring this order to
[1:46:14] try to make them be getting older we
[1:46:17] have the sunday school superintendent
[1:46:18] children's who manage the children and
[1:46:20] ensure that their children are taught
[1:46:22] well so the ushers of course those are
[1:46:24] the
[1:46:27] the sisters who are gifted you know the
[1:46:29] people that you know on singing and all
[1:46:32] that kind of thing other gifts in the
[1:46:33] nice picture gives a minute
[1:46:35] so you know somebody that is among the
[1:46:37] yeah now all those offices and night and
[1:46:40] the gifts in the church
[1:46:41] they defy the church right
[1:46:43] we also have the fivefold miniski okay
[1:46:46] pastor teacher apostle
[1:46:50] a prophet
[1:46:52] and
[1:46:54] an evangelist yeah you call him preacher
[1:46:56] so now all these five
[1:46:58] are sent to the church to edify the
[1:46:59] church but now the brother says the
[1:47:02] pastor
[1:47:04] his office
[1:47:05] is the highest authority in
[1:47:08] the church
[1:47:09] but now many people stop there
[1:47:12] but in the church we found out that the
[1:47:14] parliament is teaching that how does the
[1:47:16] pastor rule over the church
[1:47:20] by the way yes and by the spirit of god
[1:47:23] hallelujah so if any man is ruling over
[1:47:27] the church
[1:47:28] controlling the people in the church not
[1:47:30] by the miracles not by the the the word
[1:47:33] of god
[1:47:35] is not a god called man a god called man
[1:47:38] will always guide the people rule over
[1:47:40] the people by the word of god and by the
[1:47:43] holy spirit amen then also we have seen
[1:47:45] that the church
[1:47:48] of jesus christ is a female a woman
[1:47:52] okay yes because a woman always is a
[1:47:55] symbol for a church so we see
[1:47:57] spiritually a church is a woman and
[1:48:00] spiritually christ is the hospital of
[1:48:03] the church now but we have seen that
[1:48:05] this this first church that the bible
[1:48:08] calls the mother of alex
[1:48:10] the roman catholic church which grew up
[1:48:12] and here in the satirical church age it
[1:48:15] controls she controlled the people the
[1:48:17] believers the church
[1:48:19] they said we the church we the church we
[1:48:22] are the ones controlling they even keep
[1:48:24] those who refuse to believe the church's
[1:48:26] doctrine
[1:48:28] now that kind of church is not a true
[1:48:29] church of god
[1:48:31] the child must never control people
[1:48:33] when i say the church i mean the
[1:48:35] deductions of the church or the pastor
[1:48:36] himself or the leaders of the church
[1:48:38] they must never come the system can
[1:48:40] never control people
[1:48:42] the church is only physical
[1:48:45] but the spiritual church of christ will
[1:48:47] only a better word of god hallelujah but
[1:48:49] that does not mean to say pastor
[1:48:51] preaches something he said pastor please
[1:48:52] what i even say we have the holy spirit
[1:48:54] we are also people like that
[1:48:57] if the pastor is preaching something
[1:48:59] that is from the word of god and by the
[1:49:01] power of holy ghost you must never never
[1:49:04] disrespect it that's where we also going
[1:49:06] for another message recipients you must
[1:49:08] always respect and by the ban says if
[1:49:10] you can't respect the man respect the
[1:49:13] office but also if the man what is
[1:49:15] preaching or what is propagating is not
[1:49:17] of god then he doesn't walk away
[1:49:19] okay say nothing about it
[1:49:22] imagine that's how we are trained in the
[1:49:24] message
[1:49:25] right
[1:49:26] if i say something or if a man of god
[1:49:28] will say something that you don't agree
[1:49:30] with
[1:49:30] say this one pastor is wrong don't begin
[1:49:34] with putting posters right you know i
[1:49:36] can't say pastor is wrong everybody is
[1:49:38] wrong you understand that's not the
[1:49:40] spirit of god either the spirit of god
[1:49:42] what will it do you will humble yourself
[1:49:45] and leave the man along
[1:49:46] hallelujah
[1:49:48] do not go into those engagements those
[1:49:50] are kind of
[1:49:52] pull out
[1:49:53] and let the man alone even the banham
[1:49:55] says if i preach something that you
[1:49:56] don't agree with that suddenly the word
[1:49:57] of god that you don't agree with it
[1:49:58] leave it alone
[1:50:00] and you better leave something around
[1:50:02] than to fight it and then you find that
[1:50:03] you have faith in god
[1:50:05] how do you know amen oh what your sister
[1:50:08] is very good in that spirit and your
[1:50:10] sisters very could never dominate your
[1:50:11] husband amen like you should not
[1:50:13] dominate other brothers
[1:50:16] don't dominate your father
[1:50:18] when your father says
[1:50:20] no no that street is bad always be calm
[1:50:23] and humble that's how sisters present
[1:50:26] themselves hallelujah
[1:50:28] amen
[1:50:31] who else has done something oh there's
[1:50:33] someone here with a question
[1:50:35] and they're saying
[1:50:36] uh
[1:50:40] god bless you so please i think what do
[1:50:42] they mean by when you sell your
[1:50:44] birthright you are like so
[1:50:47] in page

[1:50:59] 228
[1:51:02] paragraph four
[1:51:05] line five and six one two three four
[1:51:08] okay let me read the whole paragraph he
[1:51:09] says when i apologize about for
[1:51:11] political reasons he saw this bathroom
[1:51:14] don't matter someone for any reason
[1:51:16] apart from love
[1:51:18] don't matter some people marry for
[1:51:19] political reasons if i marry from this
[1:51:21] tribe if i marry from that family if i
[1:51:23] matter you know i will be like this no
[1:51:24] no don't do that
[1:51:26] you join up with an organization and you
[1:51:28] sell you a bathroom
[1:51:31] you join up you are you join up with an
[1:51:33] organization and you serve your
[1:51:34] birthright brother
[1:51:36] whether you want to believe it or not
[1:51:39] every protestant group that ever came
[1:51:41] out and then went back sold their
[1:51:44] birthright
[1:51:45] and when you sell your birthright you
[1:51:46] are just like essa hallelujah
[1:51:50] you can cry and repent all you want but
[1:51:51] it won't do you any good there's only
[1:51:54] one thing you can do that is come out of
[1:51:56] my people and stop partaking over sins
[1:51:58] hallelujah
[1:51:59] because by this organization this
[1:52:01] denomination sister please
[1:52:04] i don't know if you're holding the
[1:52:05] message or not but those organizations
[1:52:08] which were born in the denominations
[1:52:10] they believe that if you are a member of
[1:52:13] their church please listen to me if you
[1:52:16] are a member of their church
[1:52:19] you
[1:52:20] are going to heaven and if you live you
[1:52:23] are going to hear
[1:52:24] that's what they believe
[1:52:26] and there are the members of those
[1:52:28] churches don't leave those memberships
[1:52:30] they have to get stuck in those
[1:52:32] memberships
[1:52:33] because they believe it's their ticket
[1:52:34] to heaven
[1:52:35] they see the father i have touched
[1:52:37] membership i'm going to heaven
[1:52:39] but let me tell you this message is
[1:52:40] different
[1:52:41] and the people who do those things they
[1:52:43] are selling their bathrooms just like
[1:52:45] even if it doesn't matter where it is
[1:52:47] whatever even if it is kind of messy
[1:52:49] charges some messages kind of have that
[1:52:51] kind of feeling if people are in this
[1:52:54] church they leave they go to another
[1:52:55] they have got help that's a spirit of
[1:52:57] necolationism it's a spirit not of god
[1:53:01] we are we have learned from this church
[1:53:02] edge book as we are going progressing
[1:53:04] with the studies that in in the message
[1:53:07] in the truth in the true church we are
[1:53:09] having one church hallelujah
[1:53:12] one church and which is that church how
[1:53:14] do we enter that church
[1:53:18] come on now how do we enter that church
[1:53:21] let us show ourselves
[1:53:34] i have a brother here his name is
[1:53:36] because his father is tea so he's the
[1:53:38] chili by what
[1:53:48] but i can be a part of their family by
[1:53:50] joining and therefore i would be an
[1:53:52] future member of the of the family
[1:53:55] but he is a member of the family because
[1:53:57] his body therefore in the church of
[1:53:59] jesus christ we are born in it
[1:54:02] by the way by the power of the word of
[1:54:04] god amen we must be able to receive the
[1:54:07] holy ghost that's the same whereby we
[1:54:10] are seeing the trilogy of our redemption
[1:54:12] hallelujah
[1:54:13] we say that there are some people who
[1:54:15] say if you are not a member of our
[1:54:16] attack you are going to have
[1:54:19] that kind of spirit you are saving your
[1:54:21] path right by doing that kind of thing
[1:54:22] you have to cover that kind of system
[1:54:25] we in the message
[1:54:27] thank god we don't have you know if i
[1:54:30] say
[1:54:31] days of the voice
[1:54:32] fellowship
[1:54:34] is a church and to give me the names of
[1:54:37] other churches
[1:54:39] to the church
[1:54:41] is a challenge
[1:54:43] end time
[1:54:44] evening is a chat come on
[1:54:59] they are not churches
[1:55:01] they are fellowships of the same church
[1:55:03] did you know that yes did you know that
[1:55:05] yes
[1:55:07] your friendships are the one one
[1:55:10] church if i'm a member in this
[1:55:12] fellowship i'm a member of the other
[1:55:14] did you read the message
[1:55:16] if
[1:55:17] you are excommunicated in days of the
[1:55:18] west fellowship you can not fellowship
[1:55:20] anywhere
[1:55:22] it is not allowed
[1:55:24] because we are male we are the same
[1:55:25] church
[1:55:29] if you are
[1:55:30] if you can take communion here you can
[1:55:32] also take communion
[1:55:34] in another place as long as they believe
[1:55:36] the message and preach the same message
[1:55:37] why because we are the members we are
[1:55:39] all members of the same church what is
[1:55:41] the church the church is the body of
[1:55:42] christ
[1:55:44] hallelujah and the body of christ is big
[1:55:46] and large it's all over the world
[1:55:50] not only in uganda
[1:55:51] therefore all these ones are fellowships
[1:55:54] some have many people others have small
[1:55:56] others have more others have medium it
[1:55:57] doesn't matter what matters is that we
[1:55:59] are all members of the same church
[1:56:02] if now one of them if one of that
[1:56:04] fellowship begins to feel we are there
[1:56:06] earlier which is right
[1:56:08] they have also been attacked by that
[1:56:09] speed of negligence
[1:56:11] hallelujah
[1:56:13] my sister who asked that question
[1:56:16] we
[1:56:17] that's why
[1:56:18] they must come out of her
[1:56:20] because if they begin joining systems
[1:56:22] and organizations like that
[1:56:24] saying if you're not a member of an
[1:56:26] organization you're going to hear
[1:56:29] that spirit of essa has entered them
[1:56:31] they have sought their path right you
[1:56:33] remember what srb that's how sold his
[1:56:35] birthright to organization
[1:56:37] he was hungry so you have to organize
[1:56:39] his stomach
[1:56:54] the only way
[1:56:55] to survive it is to come out the best
[1:56:57] kind of organizations and be a free man
[1:57:00] for christ
[1:57:03] we are free men three women we are not
[1:57:05] controlled by man or creed we are not
[1:57:08] controlled by what
[1:57:10] but documents
[1:57:13] organizations
[1:57:15] denominations
[1:57:17] by bishops artificials
[1:57:19] pastors we are controlled by two things
[1:57:24] that you know the brother solomon number
[1:57:26] one
[1:57:27] you are conjoined by the wrath of god
[1:57:29] hallelujah number two
[1:57:31] by the holy ghost hallelujah
[1:57:34] and the true church of god must have
[1:57:36] signs and one
[1:57:43] [Music]
[1:57:45] anybody with another question yes
[1:57:48] something you write or a question
[1:57:50] okay you have to increase your voice
[1:57:59] say that again sister
[1:58:01] i learned that good works
[1:58:05] i think that's quite wonderful not so
[1:58:07] yes amen that good works are good but
[1:58:10] they cannot
[1:58:11] but they come out
[1:58:14] they come out
[1:58:16] from a saved life out of the same life
[1:58:19] if you are if oh yeah this is wonderful
[1:58:22] god bless you my little sister now
[1:58:24] listen to this
[1:58:26] no matter what you do
[1:58:28] you might wear a longer dress even if it
[1:58:30] goes sweeping on the ground
[1:58:32] right you cannot break it a little bit
[1:58:35] you know you can pray for them that they
[1:58:37] it can't take you to heaven
[1:58:40] you can see
[1:58:41] like an angel you can't even go because
[1:58:43] of that
[1:58:44] you didn't know that yes you can go do
[1:58:46] good things and head up everyone around
[1:58:48] you and even the poor and even the
[1:58:49] widows
[1:58:54] it's just a good religion
[1:58:57] but it doesn't stop there now the
[1:58:58] problem is some stop there
[1:59:00] this is what you see your works are
[1:59:02] nothing
[1:59:03] so
[1:59:04] it doesn't matter what you do you know
[1:59:07] you see now they are trying to perfect
[1:59:09] the word of truth
[1:59:10] what they're saying then is true
[1:59:12] but then it does not stop there it
[1:59:15] continues
[1:59:17] but what do you do
[1:59:19] say that again sister
[1:59:21] good works don't save you but
[1:59:25] but the good works come out of our saved
[1:59:28] life what you do does not save you
[1:59:32] but you do what you do because you are
[1:59:34] saved
[1:59:35] hallelujah amen when you get what are
[1:59:38] baptized you get into the water not to
[1:59:40] be saved by that water but you get into
[1:59:42] that water because you are saved how do
[1:59:44] you get saved you get served by the
[1:59:47] living after salvation
[1:59:48] you believe to be saved you by faith as
[1:59:51] you say brother says amen it's not of
[1:59:54] your words it's the gift of god
[1:59:56] amen you believe with your ears you hear
[1:59:59] with your heart you believe with your
[2:00:00] muscles you confess outward unto
[2:00:03] salvation
[2:00:05] that's why you need baptism you need
[2:00:07] water baptism because you are saved amen
[2:00:18] amen
[2:00:19] why did you take a shower
[2:00:22] why are you taking do you need to take a
[2:00:24] shower to become a human being
[2:00:26] so why do you take a shower
[2:00:28] because you're a human being
[2:00:31] yes
[2:00:32] you had a pig
[2:00:34] so
[2:00:35] some people who have a spiritual pigs
[2:00:37] they don't take a shower
[2:00:39] you know but if you are having a speed
[2:00:42] of a human being a good human being you
[2:00:44] don't even need to be filled with
[2:00:45] whatever you know that you need to take
[2:00:46] a shower you only need to create a
[2:00:47] humanity
[2:00:49] and because you're a human being
[2:00:50] naturally by nature you have to take a
[2:00:52] shower right yes you have to cut your
[2:00:55] beard because you're a human being
[2:00:56] by nature
[2:00:58] right
[2:01:00] so you see the things you do doesn't
[2:01:02] make you to be a human being but you do
[2:01:03] that because you are a human being so
[2:01:06] why do you get baptized you get baptized
[2:01:07] because you are a believer
[2:01:11] he doesn't believe that i
[2:01:14] is baptized
[2:01:16] so you believe then you get baptized
[2:01:18] baptism so some people the oneness
[2:01:20] people they preach that baptism
[2:01:22] saves us
[2:01:23] so he said no baptism does not save us
[2:01:25] baptism only saves us by the answer as
[2:01:28] being an answer of a good conscience
[2:01:30] before
[2:01:31] god hallelujah
[2:01:32] so why do you dress up along with dress
[2:01:34] my sister you dress along with dress and
[2:01:36] you throw away the mini dresses and
[2:01:38] scars why because you are a believer
[2:01:41] you've been changed hallelujah where do
[2:01:44] you throw away all the makeups and every
[2:01:46] all the characters and everything
[2:01:47] because you are a believer you're not
[2:01:49] you're not throwing it away because you
[2:01:51] want to be saved but you're throwing it
[2:01:52] right because you have realized who you
[2:01:54] are
[2:01:55] you were behaving like a peak but now
[2:01:57] you're there you're not a pig so after
[2:01:58] all you're behaving like who you
[2:02:00] actually are hallelujah so the gospel
[2:02:03] only removes myself for you to see
[2:02:06] the gospels only and i open up food to
[2:02:08] realize who you are and now
[2:02:11] you don't do some things and you do
[2:02:13] something only because you're realized
[2:02:15] that you are we were so
[2:02:17] never do anything to be saved don't even
[2:02:19] give your type to become rich like i was
[2:02:22] saying
[2:02:23] what's a good but what must only be done
[2:02:25] out of a heart that has been changed so
[2:02:28] i only pay my tithe because i arise as a
[2:02:30] child of god i must appreciate god or
[2:02:33] what has given me therefore i do it in
[2:02:36] appreciation to what god has done for me
[2:02:38] not for me to get but i do it because of
[2:02:40] who i am you understand
[2:02:42] hallelujah so my children i do things
[2:02:45] for them not because i want to
[2:02:47] entice them and they and they
[2:02:50] and they
[2:02:51] bribe them to become my children i do
[2:02:53] those things for them because they're my
[2:02:55] children so you see the things you do is
[2:02:58] because of who you are and the things
[2:03:00] god does for you is because
[2:03:02] to him
[2:03:04] yeah wonderful
[2:03:06] yes the things god does for you now let
[2:03:08] me do something good for you so that's
[2:03:10] why sometimes you may not do anything
[2:03:11] for you you grow up
[2:03:22] because even if you don't want god knows
[2:03:24] you are his child and therefore you must
[2:03:26] be kidding because you're
[2:03:55] the game of that little boy who was
[2:03:56] taken in a prison
[2:03:58] in a a
[2:04:00] slave ship and when he reached the other
[2:04:02] end he realized you know he was a server
[2:04:04] king so he behaved like a son of a king
[2:04:06] and the others were like
[2:04:08] but for him he was seated like a prince
[2:04:10] behaving like a son of a king and all of
[2:04:12] a sudden
[2:04:13] what was this is he behaving a bit
[2:04:15] different different from the others when
[2:04:17] they discovered they realized that he's
[2:04:18] the son of a king from where he came
[2:04:20] from you see if you are son of a king
[2:04:22] you behave
[2:04:23] regardless of the situation around you
[2:04:25] right yes it never may encourage you it
[2:04:27] may imprison you but you don't cast god
[2:04:30] there's some things you cannot do
[2:04:32] because you are who you are
[2:04:34] god bless you for that lesson amen amen
[2:04:37] oh my hallelujah what else do we have
[2:04:40] anything else
[2:04:43] yes who has a question
[2:04:45] all right
[2:04:47] 241
[2:04:49] page
[2:04:50] 200.
[2:04:55] 41 right yes okay
[2:04:58] [Music]
[2:05:00] yes
[2:05:01] that's when we read here it is
[2:05:18] every generation
[2:05:19] right
[2:05:21] now
[2:05:22] every
[2:05:24] one of us promises
[2:05:26] is going to be applied to all the bride
[2:05:28] all through the ages
[2:05:29] just like in our generation we are
[2:05:31] promised what the relations
[2:05:33] have promised what
[2:05:36] to strain with him on his throne
[2:05:39] yeah so does it mean that the believers
[2:05:41] before us shall not reign with him
[2:05:44] they will reign with him
[2:05:46] and they will behold the christ the one
[2:05:48] will start but we will also become first
[2:05:50] the morningstar they will need the tree
[2:05:52] of life but we are also we actually
[2:05:54] already even eating the tree of life
[2:05:55] that's why the believers of this last
[2:05:57] generation are more blessed than almost
[2:05:59] all the others should say because we are
[2:06:01] pertaining of we already partake of
[2:06:03] certain things that he never took off
[2:06:06] did you realize that
[2:06:07] the entrance to the tree of life is
[2:06:09] fully open in our generation in that
[2:06:10] generation it was only a little treat
[2:06:13] but for us we now have see that's why we
[2:06:15] say that so give us the words of the
[2:06:17] song
[2:06:18] we say that
[2:06:20] god what's what what's attributes we are
[2:06:23] manifested to his bride in this last age
[2:06:27] we have called the revelation of the
[2:06:29] last prophet's message and we know who

[2:10:13] it is now how they do it
[2:10:15] they help us to raise up and come back
[2:10:17] to this house to pick up their bodies
[2:10:19] [Music]
[2:10:22] then we are caught up into the air to do
[2:10:26] it so
[2:10:26] [Music]
[2:10:40] amen do we have anybody question any yes
[2:10:52] say that again
[2:11:07] yes
[2:11:08] all these were gentiles
[2:11:10] only in some church ages
[2:11:13] there were some jews
[2:11:16] and
[2:11:17] like in
[2:11:18] the ephesians there was jews there
[2:11:22] um
[2:11:23] like the other generations yeah they
[2:11:25] will be there
[2:11:26] they are actually almost every
[2:11:27] generation will have all races of people
[2:11:30] all types of people including those who
[2:11:32] are called jews
[2:11:34] it doesn't matter if they receive christ
[2:11:37] and they die they will resurrect
[2:11:39] among the bride of music of this age it
[2:11:42] doesn't really matter who they are even
[2:11:44] right now they speak to you that there
[2:11:45] is a church i knew of two of this
[2:11:47] message in israel
[2:11:50] not all the jews are going to be among
[2:11:52] the 144
[2:11:55] yes so but but we know that when god is
[2:11:58] dealing with the jews he deals with them
[2:12:00] as a nation
[2:12:02] but there are those isolated cases
[2:12:04] of the israelites that will be saved and
[2:12:08] be among the bride for example
[2:12:10] will paul be among the right
[2:12:13] was he a jew
[2:12:15] or agenda
[2:12:32] paul was a jew but was a citizen of
[2:12:34] wrong
[2:12:35] so that's how he becomes wrong
[2:12:38] but he was from the tribe of benjamin
[2:12:40] yes
[2:12:42] and uh
[2:12:43] peter peter peter you don't even have
[2:12:45] any question at all right would it be
[2:12:47] among the jewels
[2:12:49] the weather for the four thousand or
[2:12:51] will he be among us
[2:12:55] is he part of the bride yes yes and
[2:12:56] these are our pentecostal fathers
[2:12:59] do you know that allah
[2:13:05] yes sir they are and uh this message is
[2:13:07] to restore us back to the fate of our
[2:13:09] pentecostals
[2:13:11] so yes
[2:13:12] they they will be there among the bride
[2:13:15] as long as they
[2:13:16] were allotted to be among the bride and
[2:13:19] those who are going to be among the jews
[2:13:20] the 154th they will also be there
[2:13:26] so yes
[2:13:28] are we that other questions
[2:13:33] yes
[2:13:37] [Music]
[2:13:44] about
[2:13:45] it's about being served
[2:13:50] it's about
[2:13:51] being a servant
[2:14:05] yes
[2:14:16] amen
[2:14:18] that is a very good lesson some people
[2:14:20] just want to be served
[2:14:22] may god help us always want to be
[2:14:24] servants
[2:14:25] hallelujah right and you remember i told
[2:14:28] you that they say
[2:14:29] well done my good and friendful
[2:14:32] servant are you to enjoy your bed lord
[2:14:35] now you wonder if you have never been a
[2:14:37] servant even
[2:14:46] you know
[2:14:48] if you are humbling yourself to greet
[2:14:51] someone that someone also must humble
[2:14:53] themselves to greet you
[2:14:55] but if they don't have themselves to
[2:14:56] greet you don't say you you are yourself
[2:14:59] you know you are servant
[2:15:01] so if every one of you knows you are
[2:15:03] silence all of us will be servants
[2:15:05] right yes
[2:15:07] wait until we take the lovely supper and
[2:15:09] i think we should do it before we you
[2:15:11] guys go back to school
[2:15:12] you see
[2:15:13] we have to wash one another's feet
[2:15:16] suffer from one another
[2:15:19] how can you the one who is above
[2:15:28] [Music]
[2:15:35] our attribution is jesus christ even our
[2:15:37] pastor jesus christ hallelujah he is the
[2:15:39] one who is above everyone
[2:15:41] the rest of us from one another
[2:15:44] hallelujah amen
[2:15:47] amen is
[2:16:02] huh
[2:16:11] go ahead and ask the question
[2:16:31] church we have yes
[2:16:38] from here
[2:17:05] yes
[2:17:08] that's true that's a very good question
[2:17:10] all right and i'm not done with that
[2:17:12] series so i hope you your question will
[2:17:14] still get answered in the coming menu on
[2:17:16] this sunday maybe another i don't know
[2:17:18] just stay tuned right
[2:17:20] but to answer you briefly i want to say
[2:17:22] this
[2:17:23] three more agents
[2:17:24] yes we are all free model agents
[2:17:27] knowing and believing that
[2:17:29] no one makes our decisions
[2:17:32] but when a child like elizabeth for
[2:17:34] example i give you this example
[2:17:36] is she's still a child
[2:17:39] just a right to do what she wants to be
[2:17:41] right but not yet
[2:17:44] god has blessed me in her life
[2:17:46] at such a time as this
[2:17:49] to guide her
[2:17:50] by law
[2:17:52] to control her by law
[2:17:56] until such an age that is called the age
[2:17:58] of accountability even when this guy
[2:17:59] does something wrong
[2:18:01] the neighbor cannot beat her or the
[2:18:03] neighbor cannot take her to prison
[2:18:06] they never will come to me
[2:18:08] the neighbor will not penalize that
[2:18:09] they'll ever analyze me you understand
[2:18:12] why because i am responsible so now
[2:18:16] how can i be responsible for our
[2:18:17] decision or choice
[2:18:19] because our choice has not yet grown to
[2:18:21] a time whereby it can be independent
[2:18:26] therefore god will not judge that would
[2:18:28] judge me for even for
[2:18:31] for not doing my job
[2:18:33] to train her
[2:18:35] that's why the bible says i train up a
[2:18:36] child when the child is young so that
[2:18:39] when that child grows up
[2:18:41] he will stay in the things you trained
[2:18:43] him in because when he grows up you do
[2:18:45] not have authority over the child
[2:18:47] anymore
[2:18:48] in the same spiritually speaking we are
[2:18:50] children of god so when we are in the
[2:18:53] church we are told what to do and what
[2:18:55] what we do how who tells us god through
[2:18:58] the preachers
[2:19:01] this and that unless sometimes the
[2:19:02] pastor preacher can preach something
[2:19:03] that is really quite hard for you ah
[2:19:06] how can they tell you to pray every day
[2:19:08] how can they do that why do that because
[2:19:10] you are still a child spiritual you
[2:19:11] don't have the holy ghost
[2:19:13] to you to the law
[2:19:14] yes
[2:19:15] do what a person say but eventually time
[2:19:18] is coming when
[2:19:19] you will know what you want when i go to
[2:19:21] mature when you receive the workouts
[2:19:23] when you receive the one of us you tell
[2:19:25] yourself one
[2:19:27] now i don't need to be now controlled by
[2:19:28] the law anymore
[2:19:30] because you you already have the law of
[2:19:32] god in your heart to control you and
[2:19:34] tell you what
[2:19:35] i might answer your question
[2:19:41] if the certain point is not yet answered
[2:19:43] wait until you get
[2:19:46] yeah to answer all right god bless you
[2:19:48] okay is there any more questions
[2:19:52] yes
[2:19:59] [Music]
[2:20:12] yes the parent is responsible whether
[2:20:14] they are believers or not believers
[2:20:17] and also i'll tell you this to treat a
[2:20:20] child a good character or morals does
[2:20:22] not need you to be a believer to begin
[2:20:23] with
[2:20:25] you know
[2:20:27] for a parent i used to when i did not
[2:20:29] grow up and i believe a message
[2:20:30] believers woman
[2:20:32] but our father
[2:20:33] her father never allowed my sister to
[2:20:35] wear a trouser she never did wear it
[2:20:39] our father never allowed us to
[2:20:41] have to put on the lipstick we are not
[2:20:43] in the believers home right
[2:20:46] our father never allowed us to be in
[2:20:48] groups
[2:20:49] when
[2:20:50] you know you go to school then you get a
[2:20:52] bible group you know don't be those
[2:20:54] groups that's bad
[2:20:55] and he was not a messenger believer
[2:20:58] but by virtue of the fact that he knows
[2:21:00] that those groups are going to cause us
[2:21:02] to go into alcoholism to go into
[2:21:06] prostitution to go into you know drugs
[2:21:09] abuse and things like that he would tell
[2:21:12] us don't get those groups and zero
[2:21:14] you understand
[2:21:16] by seven or by six of you should be
[2:21:19] at home
[2:21:20] all of us know it is the law of atlanta
[2:21:23] so we keep it whether is there or not
[2:21:26] there
[2:21:27] now
[2:21:28] there is no parent who is going to give
[2:21:30] an excuse before god for not raising
[2:21:33] their children right
[2:21:36] and that also goes to each of you
[2:21:38] because you are potentially parents all
[2:21:39] of you
[2:21:42] yes
[2:21:44] you must raise
[2:21:45] you have to say that that child do what
[2:21:48] she wants when she grows you will
[2:21:50] know what is right
[2:21:52] you are risking
[2:21:54] that child does not know what is right
[2:21:56] and even when should we should never
[2:21:57] know it
[2:21:58] so you have to tell that time what is
[2:22:00] right now when she grows
[2:22:03] there are families for example that are
[2:22:06] a
[2:22:13] you as a man who is prepared to marry in
[2:22:15] about five to ten years
[2:22:17] amen
[2:22:18] you are
[2:22:21] you have some families you can't marry
[2:22:23] from
[2:22:23] and you have some families you can marry
[2:22:25] from
[2:22:26] now
[2:22:27] you will still be the same one even if
[2:22:29] you do not believe the message also
[2:22:31] you see
[2:22:32] so it's not because it's an evil message
[2:22:34] i was very
[2:22:36] no
[2:22:37] you would not that family
[2:22:39] those people are thieves
[2:22:42] you understand
[2:22:43] why because their parents never trained
[2:22:45] their children
[2:22:46] it began from sugar selling sugar
[2:22:48] stealing things from the neighbors and
[2:22:50] they treat their parents who are not
[2:22:51] training them don't do that they're like
[2:22:54] ah my child even when someone comes at
[2:22:56] home but i mean you see they just eat
[2:22:59] things from their neighborhood
[2:23:01] i cannot do anything now they just do it
[2:23:04] i don't know
[2:23:05] they're right there further
[2:23:07] you know
[2:23:08] not when the child grows
[2:23:10] you're going to stay still in the
[2:23:11] ceiling and you'll become a robber now
[2:23:14] they know what you see they
[2:23:16] become children you understand
[2:23:19] their children that their families where
[2:23:21] they are all the new prostitution
[2:23:25] you find that
[2:23:26] the man was going here with many women
[2:23:28] also the child sees that and we also get
[2:23:32] and when they get the father will not be
[2:23:34] able to correct the child because they
[2:23:35] know that they are doing the same thing
[2:23:37] saying keep quiet and then the child
[2:23:39] will grow up and they also become
[2:23:41] prosecute you understand so you see
[2:23:44] things like that it they said charity
[2:23:46] begins at oh
[2:23:48] therefore there are some families a wise
[2:23:51] man cannot marry foreign
[2:23:56] [Music]
[2:24:00] if i matter there there there is a very
[2:24:02] clear sign that i may have a part b
[2:24:05] of what is there in my own you
[2:24:07] understand
[2:24:08] so friends that's what it all means
[2:24:11] it is a hundred percent god
[2:24:15] the parents are responsible for 100
[2:24:18] on training their children and to ensure
[2:24:20] they do train them to do what is right
[2:24:22] because if they do not train them they
[2:24:24] will be responsible for their life
[2:24:27] you see
[2:24:28] that's why
[2:24:29] when you're still young and your father
[2:24:31] mother beats you with the road you hate
[2:24:33] them
[2:24:34] with me
[2:24:36] but when you grow up
[2:24:38] the mommy and daddy
[2:24:41] you even begin loving them more you
[2:24:43] understand
[2:24:44] and there are some children when they
[2:24:45] grow they realize
[2:24:47] that this point in my life they support
[2:24:48] my life because they remember you know
[2:24:51] that money i want
[2:24:52] i want to to buy this thing it's okay my
[2:24:54] baby you back i want that on your body
[2:24:57] ah you can't even have i just bought
[2:24:59] something for you just let that be
[2:25:00] enough for you what are you he's sitting
[2:25:02] in a child you're not even training a
[2:25:03] child to appreciate what they have
[2:25:06] but you're spreading them with the toys
[2:25:08] here and there you understand that child
[2:25:10] will grow without appreciating life
[2:25:13] without knowing the value of life
[2:25:15] so
[2:25:16] integrity
[2:25:18] you know you know it's taught when
[2:25:20] you're still young
[2:25:21] you understand appreciating the value of
[2:25:24] life you stole when you're still young
[2:25:28] work is taught when you're still yeah
[2:25:32] if your mom will tell you sweep
[2:25:35] and they leave you
[2:25:37] you will grow up like that even when you
[2:25:39] go your boss will tell you do this
[2:25:41] he will chase you out from the job and
[2:25:43] you'll be jobless
[2:25:45] who's always responsible you are not
[2:25:47] taught where you are so you cannot you
[2:25:49] can sort of talk about men anyways
