Ruth um evening light I Fellowship from evening light and Pastor Ty Joseph is my pastor God bless amen and so we are right in that church we are part of that church and you are coming from that Fellowship another fellowship of the same church so you're part of us are very good friends to us as well come to have a great friendship over the years [Music] um is there anybody else that did not agreed okay so um our sister Rose is not here this morning she's sick please we are going to remember her in prayers yesterday and then left for home last night so we will pray for her in the service but also you need to remember her in prayers Mr Ruth also of course you know that she delivered God delivered her of a child so I don't know how many have reached out to her send us some money if you don't have a contact please reach Brother Martin Martin give you the contract or direct you to our home yesterday we had a wonderful time in Chicago um I hope that some were able to stream those who did not come on we had a music christian music concert he requested me to go and share the word with them I was telling the pastor after the service that uh Pastor I'm sorry we've turned this into a Revival meeting because after the the little preaching you know we had a prayer line of more than 30 minutes it was a good time young people had a good time in worship I think it was a wonderful amen Amina so after the service yesterday of course as you know we are we've been reaching out there for some time now the Hashem being there as a student um so they can kind of came up with an idea there could be meeting so I don't know maybe this was the fourth time for yeah fourth time for me to go and uh this time we shared with them on the original scene it was a very good experience you know these young people just love the Lord you know and we were able to get to sit down I thought we'll do it for 30 or 40 minutes but we did for more maybe two hours and a half or more and they were just receptive and had many questions it was a really nice thing please pray for the I call it the Revival in entirely pray for that Reviving we never know what the Lord would do was telling me we need to start a fellowship there but who knows what the Lord she told me that she was or is a preacher and so uh we've been sharing the message among the students [Music] than the others and that this is our second time to come and be with us in the service you know and yesterday was it yesterday or the other day she told me she's ready for baptism today just right over here can you come and tell us whether you're ready for water baptism um my first time to be baptized I was baptized in the the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit and I was baptized after me knowing that it is one of the acts that we should do as Christians but then last weekend when I shared with pasta I got to know that this is not the right way and then I chose to be baptized again thank you again well the right way is for one to be immersed in water ingredients in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ so much so um you know she listened in last weekend when she was here yeah and I love the way she said he said this is too much let me digest it for a while [Music] after the weekend she told me now I'm ready I will come to that moment it's a wonderful thing to have the word bath to be born of the word it's a nice nice and so today after the service today and pray that God will fill her with the Holy Ghost I just told her she's ready to continue justifying she should be ready as much as a woman cannot be a preacher or a pastor or you know any of those things but it doesn't mean she cannot justify about what she has received amen amen and so um we also I wanted to let you know that in next month I'm traveling to Ethiopia Ethiopia this is going to be a major trip [Music] [Music] also we've had a meeting with the committee that is preparing the youth meetings if it wasn't because of time I would invite them to come here but I would not because of times and we've been able to come up with a budget of exactly what we will need for the meetings to be successful and I have a habit right here before me uh it comes to 30 30.5 million yeah the meetings are going to take place on 12th to 14th of January how many are looking forward to this meeting I'm actually looking forward to those meetings and to those of you who have not yet heard we are going to host our precious brother Tim of the fruit the U.S also we shall be having Brother David Mayer from uh whenever I talk about Brother David may I get confused because he he is Swiss he is sweets with his land well but he works in Switzerland but he decided to live in France so Brother David Mayer from Switzerland and from France whatever whatever both of these are wonderful man of God who have been laboring in the world over the years then we also have a brother uh but the Taz Taswell Jeffries Trina and organ the tires well Jeffries this brother was streaming the last youth meetings he's a minister from New Zealand New Zealand he said he told me I streamed all the meetings and I would love to be a part of this next coming or upcoming meetings they've got an opportunity to listen to a little bit of his summons what he was preaching to the young people in his country and I think his ministry would be a blessing the Lord willing I'll also have him minister in one of the services told me that he's coming with a bunch of young people from Nairobi is I've had young people already tell them they're warming up from from Zimbabwe world so this is going to be some sort of international youth meeting [Music] and we are privileged that we are going to be hosting it they're going to be here from Kenya way from Switzerland Switzerland from the USA America New Zealand from Uganda and from Ethiopia they told me they're coming from Magnum it's going to be a wonderful time don't miss it for anything I'm warming up for it that God will bless our young people just what we are looking up foreign and 30.5 million million uh we have decided to request each person to contribute I'm talking about those who are coming in from outside to contribute at least um 50 000 Shillings each person will be here for three days of course with the budget you understand that this will not be able to fully Finance the whole budget well what it is and I know others probably stream this much later or from other churches we want to I want to let them know both on YouTube and also whatever so tell them you know we need we need you to register now [Music] how do you register by sending in your contribution when you're sending your contribution we just capture your details and we put it in our registered so young people could actually begin by paying um maybe part of it or all of it or even more than that whatever you can be able to contribute but you can do that by mobile management mechanism but for us here now yes the members here the members are requesting each of us to contribute at least a hundred thousand the minimum you can do more if at least if 50 people gave a hundred thousand each that is five million Urban to attended that means we're going somewhere so uh let's let's do that not push it ahead because time runs fast how men are looking forward to the youth meeting are you looking forward I'd like you to pray God will make it a success praise the Lord hallelujah I'd like us to open we are going to read in Hebrews 4 but we shall single choruses before we get into the scripture after the ministry yesterday no doubt I'm aware in the body but I need your prayers that Lord will enable me to say something we will bless you today amen Amina there is this song that has been echoing in my mind since yesterday and one sister can help me sing it is [Music] called they call him Jesus Jesus never fails Hallelujah the purpose why I always sing A Chorus before getting into the preaching is because we want to connect with the Holy Spirit to us [Music] so let us sing this together soon [Music] with me [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] that is [Music] is true [Music]

Hebrews chapter 4 verse 14. we're looking at verse 14 to verses 16. seeing then that we we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession is [Music] for we have not on a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin is [Music] meaning we have a high priests let us terrify come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of name is foreign [Music] praise the name of the Lord and I hear the scripture is telling us about our high priest and he says that his name is Jesus Oh My can you tell your neighbor his name is Jesus Hallelujah Jesus [Music] came to Amen to take a shot yes can you take away from among the Gentiles the Jews were cut off Romans they were cut off because of unbelief the moment someone refuses to believe in Jesus [Music] and Jesus is here today in the form of his wife Jesus speaking to you yes and he says we should hold our profession we have a high priest foreign [Music] [Music] is not news [Music] [Music] that's what the Bible says the pastor must be a husband of one wife foreign 23 you God will be with him foreign foreign now don't say mine is different my challenge is different whatever point you are going through he was tempted yes yes whatever your problem is Jesus one time whatever you are your temptation is Jesus he concludes and he says so now when you are coming to the throne of grace comes don't come undecided won't come not sure will sit with me foreign [Music] there is no woman the wedding because that has ever given himself and God never changed them into something anyway all your infirmities some of you have given yourself I I don't want I don't know if they're here when I say this and you're part of them you can give a testimony today that is foreign this one is a quote that is really powerful man you can free some of you today he says how it can free them says how was it in God how was it God's blood Kathy agama how God is blood y because it was God's creative blood that he created Jesus is blood yes was God is Jesus was not a half God yes he was good himself he says in order to redeem us and he came and lived in the same birthday that he created yet tell me about the power of Saturn I'll tell you about the power of my God God himself wanted to redeem um foreign Chicago foreign [Music] foreign foreign but what they never didn't know that Jesus he was not only a man he was gone he was a good man he became tired and slept yeah that is the purpose hallelujah hallelujah and as a man come on you might have felt something to say that that very moment our sins are forgiveness he suffered even sexual temptation he had to suffer all kinds of themselves to be tempted by the devil I came away sit down in the riches and powers and so forth he had to suffer all of us in order to do it you couldn't be as God in spirit Jesus was God in flesh with us you have to understand what we are going through yeah three times he had to test the cruelty of sins HIV in all points sexual Temptation for power as the devil never tempted you because [Music] [Music] we saw that on Sunday the last of the Flesh of the eyes those are the three things even in Genesis that even Adam were attempted the same things these people were doing
