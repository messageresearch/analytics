[7:52] to to watch that testimony
[7:58] ofor ones who have not I don't know
[8:01] which world you are living
[8:03] in there are many actually more than a
[8:06] thousand people who have watched that
[8:09] already heard from hundreds of
[8:12] [Music]
[8:13] them
[8:15] Tony so we had some kind
[8:18] of uh some kind of uh Studio
[8:23] here and they were we were having an
[8:28] interview morus and his wife and with my

[11:57] Zoom service tonight
[12:01] so weend all
[12:05] ours just going to read one
[12:09] verse and out of 1 Corinthians chapter
[12:14] 11 the first
[12:18] verse shall we
[12:21] pray Our Kind heavenly
[12:24] father as I'm approaching your holy word
[12:30] my request Lord is that you will come
[12:32] and make it alive to
[12:35] us we can do nothing of
[12:38] ourselves we have no abilities of our
[12:41] own we submit whatever little we have to
[12:44] you
[12:45] tonight I ask that you will come and
[12:48] bless everyone that is
[12:49] here everyone that is here in
[12:52] this may it be a blessing to them in
[12:56] Jesus
[12:57] name amen so whenever I'm doing Zoom I
[13:00] also usually we just usually go strictly
[13:03] for 1
[13:06] hour so by 656 we'll be finishing
[13:13] the so uh let's read in Jesus
[13:18] name be ye followers of me even as I
[13:22] also am of
[13:27] Christ
[13:29] amen may be
[13:33] seated so I'm preaching
[13:36] on pointing people to
[13:44] Christ pointing people to
[13:48] Christ now we have a lot of
[13:50] churches we have a lot of people
[13:53] preaching we have a lot of Pastors in
[13:55] the world we have a lot of denominations
[13:58] and
[14:01] religions and a lot of systems as
[14:04] well and the biggest of which is
[14:06] actually the Roman Catholic
[14:09] Church um and you see everyone that
[14:12] comes up can almost get a
[14:16] following you know they will you know
[14:18] get a following it's not it's not hard
[14:20] to get a
[14:21] following and these days people love
[14:23] getting a
[14:26] following not only physically
[14:29] but also on social
[14:31] media people are happy to get a
[14:34] following on Tik Tok if you have
[14:38] following on WhatsApp you have a
[14:41] following and you are very excited
[14:43] because of those
[14:44] things on on LinkedIn on
[14:47] Twitter and someone will say I have
[14:49] 10,000
[14:50] followers and he will be very
[14:53] excited and you will feel that is
[14:56] something but you see it's nothing to
[14:58] have a
[15:00] following because I will tell you one
[15:03] one there is one person in the
[15:05] world has the biggest
[15:08] following and that is
[15:10] Saturn not even Jesus
[15:13] Satan sat has the biggest
[15:16] following so having a following is not a
[15:19] big
[15:20] deal you know the Bible says the way
[15:24] that leads to
[15:26] hell and many there be that
[15:30] but the WEA leads to Heaven is narrow is
[15:34] straight and few there
[15:37] that but you know many people
[15:40] always they desire to have a big
[15:43] following or they desire to follow where
[15:45] there are many people
[15:48] following I remember one
[15:50] time an airport in
[15:53] Nairobi and we were we were driving you
[15:56] know through a to
[16:00] in order for us to enter the
[16:02] airport and so the brother that was was
[16:06] driving you know there were about three
[16:08] or four
[16:10] lenses so he decided to take the
[16:13] Lan that was
[16:16] crowded I told him brother why did you
[16:18] make that
[16:20] decision he said where everybody's going
[16:23] there that means there is something
[16:25] ahead that is hindering others to go on
[16:28] the other land which has no
[16:30] Cs and when we reached ahead we found
[16:34] there was actually no problem on the
[16:36] other
[16:39] land but the only reason why people took
[16:41] the other crowded
[16:44] land was that everybody
[16:46] thought as long as people are going on
[16:49] this
[16:50] landan it means that is the
[16:54] right and that's the problem we have in
[16:56] the world
[16:57] today people want to take popular
[17:00] [Music]
[17:01] opinion people want to decide what
[17:04] others have decided
[17:06] before it's very difficult for people to
[17:08] take personal
[17:11] decision it's very difficult for people
[17:13] to have personal
[17:15] choices but I said you it pays
[17:18] off to have a personal choice to have a
[17:22] personal
[17:23] decision and this year I want to have a
[17:26] personal decision to follow Jesus
[17:30] Christ even if all others are not
[17:32] following
[17:33] him I want to follow him and so Paul
[17:36] said be you followers of
[17:39] me amen can I have more voice more sound
[17:42] even as even I even as I also am of
[17:49] Christ follow me as I follow
[17:52] Christ now the thing
[17:54] here Paul was pointing people to Christ
[18:01] he was listen he was not pointing people
[18:03] to
[18:05] himself or to his church or to his
[18:09] organization are you listening to me he
[18:12] was pointing people to Jesus
[18:16] Christ can we say Amen to
[18:19] that there's some things I want to deal
[18:22] with
[18:24] tonight and so now I'd like I want you
[18:27] to hear this from the message my
[18:31] commission he says can I say something
[18:33] from my
[18:35] heart if it is all right there are some
[18:39] people went forth and and had strange
[18:41] feelings in their hand
[18:46] afterwards the prophet of God is
[18:48] speaking about the gift he
[18:51] had the gift he had in his hand that he
[18:54] would if he would sleep his hand in the
[18:56] in the hand of the other person
[19:00] then the other person would begin listen
[19:01] to feel a few things in their
[19:05] hand and so what would happen would be
[19:09] that this person would feel
[19:11] different and uh then they would feel
[19:15] strange
[19:17] feelings after they touched the hand of
[19:19] the
[19:20] prophet and they got the wrong
[19:24] impression they got thinking you heal
[19:26] people by some feeling
[19:30] that you had in your
[19:33] hand many would come to me and say
[19:36] brother
[19:37] bham feel and see if I got healing
[19:43] power brother Solomon are you following
[19:46] me here feel and see if if if I if I
[19:49] have healing
[19:51] power because they begin to feel some
[19:54] strange
[19:55] feeling no he says no I will tell you
[19:59] now you
[20:01] haven't the only healing
[20:04] power there is lays in Christ
[20:09] Jesus do you know there are many people
[20:12] today many many uh so-called
[20:16] prophets that feel that they
[20:19] anointed differently than
[20:22] others and people pay money to meet
[20:27] them they feel they are so
[20:31] anointed and they are so much on
[20:33] demand that they need to be rewarded for
[20:38] their
[20:40] anointing and so here was a man that was
[20:43] really anointed in our
[20:47] generation and he told these people who
[20:49] kind of felt that they had a feeling in
[20:51] their
[20:51] [Music]
[20:53] hand he says do I have power
[20:56] brother touch me and
[20:59] what as a prophet tell me do I have
[21:02] healing
[21:03] power because I feel different in
[21:06] my he says I will tell you now you don't
[21:10] have
[21:11] it the only healing power that there
[21:14] is it relays in Jesus
[21:17] Christ that's right that is all the only
[21:21] thing that you can
[21:23] do is to point people to
[21:27] that
[21:28] and that's all I can
[21:30] do all anyone else can do is to point
[21:35] people to Jesus
[21:38] Christ who has already healed
[21:41] them listen listen Church in other words
[21:45] that there is no person on the world
[21:48] today that has different
[21:52] powers or strong powers or healing
[21:55] powers are you following me
[21:58] whether it's a pastor a prophet a
[22:01] preacher prophetes there is no one with
[22:05] special
[22:08] powers you did not say Amen do you
[22:10] believe
[22:11] that no man no woman has special
[22:15] power there is only one special
[22:19] power and that is in Jesus
[22:23] Christ he's the only one with
[22:26] power so in another
[22:29] if we don't if any religion listen if
[22:31] any
[22:32] religion if any
[22:34] worship If any man of God any church
[22:39] does not Point people to Jesus
[22:42] Christ it is not worth
[22:45] following we should only follow that
[22:49] which points us to Jesus
[22:51] Christ we should follow a church that
[22:53] points out to Jesus
[22:55] Christ we should follow a move or a
[22:58] movement that points out to Jesus
[23:01] Christ and let me tell you anything that
[23:04] does not point to to
[23:06] Christ pointing to a man
[23:10] somewhere he to a man in
[23:13] America poting to a man in Congo poting
[23:16] to a man in
[23:17] camon to a man in
[23:20] Uganda but let me tell you we in this
[23:23] message by the grace of God we have been
[23:26] removed from such
[23:28] system amen we have been brought in a
[23:31] place amen let me tell you about our
[23:34] religion let me tell you about our
[23:37] religion what we believe in is that this
[23:41] message is pointing us to one
[23:44] thing and that is Jesus Christ and
[23:48] anything without
[23:49] Christ is dead but I'm so glad they have
[23:54] been pointed to Jesus
[23:56] Christ I'm so glad I've been pointed to
[24:01] Christ listen from the message God has
[24:04] has a provided
[24:06] way a minister couldn't save no
[24:11] one you may say well what about an
[24:13] anointed man
[24:16] of what about what about
[24:19] somebody who has an
[24:22] anointing someone who has a you know a
[24:25] powerful preaching Ministry
[24:29] it says a minister couldn't save no
[24:32] one even our
[24:35] Prophet cannot save you brother bam
[24:39] cannot serve
[24:40] no are you following me he's a man of
[24:45] God but he cannot save you he's a
[24:48] prophet of Our Generation he cannot save
[24:51] you what about me your pastor I cannot
[24:54] save
[24:55] you we've seen churches
[24:58] that follow their
[25:00] pastors as a
[25:03] Creed as a as a
[25:06] Dogma they follow them that that they
[25:10] will do everything they
[25:13] doing say everything they saying that is
[25:17] good in the
[25:18] part but let me tell you if you are
[25:21] Pastor even if it is myself if I'm
[25:24] teaching you something that is not
[25:27] pointing to
[25:29] Christ then I'm leading you to
[25:32] myself a minister cannot save no
[25:36] one he could only preach the
[25:39] gospel if he's anointed of the Holy
[25:43] Spirit and he will Point people to the
[25:46] place where they were
[25:49] saved a place where they were
[25:53] saved where they were
[25:56] saved listen to me me a minister an
[26:00] anointed
[26:02] ministry will point you to a
[26:05] place where you were
[26:08] saved not he is not to save you he comes
[26:12] to show you that is the place where you
[26:17] were saved do you know the place where
[26:19] you were
[26:20] saved 2,000 years
[26:23] ago on
[26:25] Calvary when Jesus shed his blood for us
[26:30] that is the place where we were
[26:34] saved I am not saved
[26:36] yesterday I am not saved today I was
[26:39] saved amen 2,000 years
[26:42] ago when Jesus died for me and he paid
[26:45] the price and
[26:47] the and the anointed
[26:51] Ministry point you to
[26:53] that a place where they were sa at
[26:56] Calvary have listen listen you have to
[26:59] accept
[27:00] it as your personal savior
[27:05] now in order to have
[27:09] benefits
[27:10] dividence of of his
[27:14] death and enjoy the
[27:17] attributes of what he died
[27:21] for
[27:22] Hallelujah that's why you know Paul said
[27:26] follow me
[27:28] as I follow Christ even because he was
[27:30] pointing them to Christ he was pointing
[27:35] them to Christ but what we have today we
[27:39] have
[27:40] places that they call holy
[27:43] places we have water they call Holy
[27:46] Water we have oil they call Holy
[27:50] oil holy
[27:52] person can you imagine there is a man
[27:54] here they call his
[27:56] holiness
[27:59] his Holiness
[28:01] the that is a
[28:03] fallacy that's not truth come on brother
[28:06] prach it's not the
[28:08] truth
[28:10] fallacy thank God for the message
[28:12] of because we have been redeemed out of
[28:17] lives no man is
[28:19] Holy in such a way that Holiness is in
[28:23] them there is only one that is Holy and
[28:27] that is
[28:29] God there is no Holy Mountain there is
[28:32] no holy water there is no holy place
[28:35] there is noly person there is only a
[28:38] holy
[28:39] God and anything that God is
[28:43] in that is a holy
[28:46] thing amen and why do they call
[28:49] themselves
[28:50] holy because they want to take the place
[28:53] of
[28:54] God how do you know God is in something
[28:59] when Christ is in it when they receive
[29:02] the
[29:03] word Christ where is Christ Christ is in
[29:07] his own
[29:08] word amen but they deny the
[29:11] word and they claim to have Christ in
[29:15] them they deny the word and the women
[29:18] become
[29:20] preachers the Bible is very
[29:22] clear a woman is not supposed to be a
[29:25] preacher or a pastor
[29:27] but they make themselves pastors and
[29:30] they claim to be
[29:32] holy that is a lie because the word is
[29:35] not in
[29:37] them and when Jesus Christ came on the
[29:40] earth he looked at them and he said you
[29:44] are not holy you are not even of
[29:47] Moses you not even of Abraham and they
[29:50] were
[29:52] offended but listen what did he tell
[29:54] them he said because you reject me
[29:58] the word is not in
[30:01] you they had to accept him this
[30:05] generation has to accept
[30:08] god listen brother sister if what you
[30:11] are doing if your life does not show
[30:15] Christ Christ is not in
[30:18] you if you the life you're living the
[30:21] thoughts you are thinking the works you
[30:23] are doing whether you are seen or you
[30:26] are not seen
[30:28] if it cannot be identified by the
[30:31] word Christ is not in
[30:33] you and if Christ is not in you you will
[30:37] not go to the
[30:38] Rapture I want to go to the
[30:41] Rapture I want to go to the
[30:43] Rapture I don't want to remain
[30:46] here I want to be holy even as he is
[30:50] Holy that's why he said be ye
[30:53] holy even as I am Holy God is the only
[30:56] holy
[30:58] and he wants us to be
[30:59] holy even as he is Holy how can we be
[31:04] holy receiving the Holy
[31:06] Ghost when you receive a holy ghost you
[31:10] you become
[31:13] holy praise the name of the
[31:16] Lord and in the message ConEd and then
[31:21] concerned he says there is no holy
[31:24] people there is no Holy Mountain
[31:27] there is no holy
[31:30] church there are churches here
[31:33] today that tell us if you are not a
[31:36] member of the Catholic church if you're
[31:39] not a member the church why do you
[31:44] think that we have many
[31:50] churches and each of these
[31:53] churches claim to be the ones that are
[31:56] right
[31:58] but each of those
[32:00] churches teach the Bible
[32:05] differ the Catholic Church will tell
[32:10] you you know what you need to do is to
[32:14] believe there is one holy man on
[32:17] Earth and his name is the
[32:19] pope he represent Jesus
[32:22] Christ and also you have to believe that
[32:25] you can actually tell the priests
[32:28] your sins and they will actually forgive
[32:32] you and they are saying we are the only
[32:37] church we are the only true
[32:40] church even Catholic means
[32:45] Universal they the only they The
[32:47] Universal Church of
[32:50] Jesus where do you find
[32:52] that where do you find in the Bible that
[32:54] priests cannot marry
[32:58] but the Bible says in the book of First
[33:01] Timothy that these people have doctrines
[33:03] of
[33:05] devils where they forbid people to
[33:10] marry do of
[33:12] devils in
[33:14] hypocrisy because they forbid people to
[33:17] marry and again they have
[33:21] children what is that Christ is not in
[33:25] that and then they other come they say
[33:28] no we are the only right ones and they
[33:30] say but you know what we believe you
[33:34] cannot eat
[33:35] pork you cannot eat this you canot eat
[33:38] that but what does Jesus say his word he
[33:43] says those people who have do of
[33:47] devils they also forbid people to eat
[33:51] some
[33:53] meat so what is that it's also not
[33:56] correct
[33:58] can be in and then comes the
[34:01] anglicans where they will say well we
[34:04] the only right Church they the ones who
[34:07] protested but what do they do they
[34:10] baptize babies where do you find that in
[34:12] the
[34:14] Bible and then another will come
[34:18] P I am the right one all the others are
[34:21] wrong and what will they do they would
[34:24] say
[34:25] well we baptizing much
[34:28] father
[34:29] holy show me one person in the Bible
[34:32] that was baptized in much water in
[34:35] father son Holy Spirit everyone that was
[34:39] baptized was baptized in the name of
[34:41] Jesus
[34:42] Christ and so that is not the only the
[34:46] church but yet each of them claim to be
[34:49] the right
[34:51] church and the holy
[34:53] church but let me tell you God Has
[34:56] Lifted up a
[34:58] stand and showed what his
[35:01] Holiness Jesus is not in a
[35:03] church not a
[35:05] denomination when any church
[35:08] denominates that church
[35:11] dies God does not walk behind a
[35:15] denomination God is Not led by a
[35:18] denomination where is God he is in
[35:22] Christ where is Christ Christ is in his
[35:25] word and whever his word is
[35:28] preached that is where Christ
[35:31] is and we have the message of the
[35:34] hour what is the message the message is
[35:38] Christ coming down in the end
[35:41] time calling people out of the systems
[35:46] of out of the
[35:48] denominations Hallelujah are you one of
[35:51] them he has called us out where are we
[35:55] we are out of the denominations we are
[35:57] higher than the nominations we have the
[35:59] eego
[36:01] anointing we we are flying
[36:03] higher come on church we are flying
[36:06] higher we are not down low we are up
[36:10] higher where are we going are going in
[36:14] Rapture soon we are going to meet the
[36:15] Lord
[36:17] in and what about others even in the
[36:21] message they are trying to
[36:25] denominate even in the message they try
[36:28] to bring those
[36:30] attitudes our church is the only
[36:32] CH our church is the only CH when you
[36:35] see that
[36:39] Spirit I'm telling you run from that
[36:42] spirit in the message we have no
[36:46] denomination in the message we have one
[36:49] Church The Universal Church of Jesus
[36:53] Christ where is it it is not a physical
[36:56] Church
[36:57] it is a mystical
[36:59] body come on Church it can be seen
[37:04] everywhere oh glory to God come and
[37:06] preach with me tonight there are people
[37:10] almost everywhere whose hearts are all
[37:13] afame their hearts are on fire you
[37:16] cannot find them in one place where
[37:20] scattered near and everywhere in the
[37:24] world in Uganda Zimbabwe they are in
[37:28] Tanzania in Ethiopia they everywhere
[37:32] they have one Pastor their Pastor
[37:35] Jesus Jesus Christ they all Bap in Jesus
[37:42] name glory to God we are no longer under
[37:46] a denomination we are no longer under
[37:49] system of we have been
[37:52] pointed to Jesus
[37:55] Christ your neighbor been pointed to
[37:57] Jesus
[38:01] Christ enough of those religious
[38:06] demons we are under the system of the
[38:10] Holy
[38:12] Ghost hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[38:16] we are not under a system of
[38:19] man and that's why I always say in the
[38:23] message what do we have we have one
[38:27] church but many
[38:33] fellowships every where they
[38:35] are they our brothers they part of the
[38:39] body some are 50 here others 100 others
[38:43] 500 2,000 other 10,000 all of us
[38:47] together all over the world we are the
[38:49] body of Jesus
[38:51] Christ so there is no holy
[38:54] people no Holy Mountain
[38:57] holy God in the
[39:00] people a holy God in the people that is
[39:03] why friends we don't need to find God on
[39:06] a mountain
[39:08] somewhere it's okay to go to a Prayer
[39:10] Mountain we don't need to find God on a
[39:13] mountain
[39:14] somewhere that God is no longer just on
[39:18] the
[39:19] mountain the god of the mountain is the
[39:22] god of the valley The God Who is on the
[39:25] mountain he's a God who can come down in
[39:27] a valley where you are and he will meet
[39:30] you at the place of
[39:32] your he's a God as long as he's in a
[39:35] place then it's a holy place we don't
[39:38] find him in a four W
[39:43] building called a church we don't find
[39:46] him only in one
[39:48] religion one church or one sect or one
[39:52] group we have denom we have churches
[39:55] Church names
[39:58] days of the voice Fellowship days of the
[39:59] voice fellowship and we think that is
[40:02] great spoken word tacle spoken word
[40:06] Tabernacle Holy Spirit fire Holy
[40:10] Spirit evening
[40:13] light that's powerful
[40:15] Nam but it's
[40:21] nothing we have very many remind me the
[40:25] names

[40:30] Church give me the
[40:35] names that's a powerful name right give
[40:38] me come on SN white oh my

[40:54] Touch come on give me name
[40:58] restor Faith oh my God
[41:02] rest and all these names are
[41:04] power are you hearing me and it is
[41:07] getting into the heads of
[41:10] people until you think if someone is not
[41:14] a member of
[41:17] dvf is not a Believer if you have that
[41:21] attitude that is a spirit from Hell On
[41:25] You any believer that has been baptized
[41:30] in the name of Jesus Christ and has the
[41:32] Holy Ghost amen is a child of God a Son
[41:36] of God no matter where they go for
[41:39] fellow and that's what we believe that's
[41:42] what we stand for this message has
[41:46] pointed us not to one man not to one p
[41:51] not to One Church appointed us to Jesus
[41:55] Christ
[41:59] if whatever you are
[42:01] eating whatever
[42:03] youting after eating it it makes you
[42:07] feel your group is the only right
[42:10] one you have eaten
[42:14] poison whatever you eat will make you
[42:18] believe you are one little
[42:21] p on a beach but there are many other
[42:25] PES
[42:27] it will make you feel you are not the
[42:29] only body but you are part of the
[42:34] body that's what we
[42:37] believe the body of Christ is a a
[42:40] mystical
[42:44] body and because some of
[42:47] us because in our
[42:50] fellowship we see it
[42:52] better whatever better we see it it is
[42:56] only a good God that has allowed us to
[42:58] see that
[43:00] way don't forget there another
[43:03] fellowship that also sees it
[43:07] better and another one that sees it
[43:10] better but all these fellowships before
[43:14] Jesus Christ are really on the same
[43:18] level if we are going to have a
[43:21] Rapture there is no good
[43:24] Rapture and better
[43:27] Rapture come on bride we have one
[43:31] Rapture for all the
[43:34] believer if you filled with the Holy
[43:36] Ghost you are going to go in the
[43:39] Rapture no matter where you
[43:42] Fellowship you don't need to join dvf to
[43:45] goap you don't need to leave your church
[43:47] to go inap wherever you are you may be a
[43:51] member of evening life you will go
[43:53] Rapture that way you may be me of
[43:57] rapt that you may be in Zim brother you
[44:01] don't need to come
[44:02] to whever you are the Raptor is going to
[44:06] come to
[44:07] you why because the Holy Ghost is in
[44:14] you hallelujah hallelujah that's what we
[44:19] believe we don't find one
[44:21] man we don't find him in one
[44:25] man he is in a many membered
[44:29] body and that's why you feel you
[44:33] find men that God has used so powerfully
[44:37] over when they begin to feel that they
[44:40] are the best the ones with the better
[44:42] Revelation than
[44:44] others and they begin to look down on
[44:46] other
[44:48] preachers what happens they form a
[44:52] cult they kind of begin to feel
[44:54] indifferent
[44:56] when another brother comes from another
[44:58] fellowship they can't even say God bless
[45:01] you because this one is not am
[45:05] on lower than me and
[45:07] me that attitude is not from Heaven it
[45:11] is from
[45:13] Lucifer the attitude we should
[45:16] have should be this we are all children
[45:20] of
[45:20] God we are hairs with the
[45:23] father we are joint ha with the son
[45:27] and soon and very soon we are going to
[45:29] see the
[45:30] king Hallelujah and every man's labors
[45:33] will be
[45:36] rewarded there should be no divisions in
[45:38] the
[45:40] body as human beings we have different
[45:44] opinions we have different ways we see
[45:46] different
[45:48] things one Pastor will see one thing
[45:51] differently another will something
[45:54] differ doesn't make one holier than the
[45:59] other it just makes us
[46:04] human and that's why a prophet would
[46:07] say that every human
[46:11] being should find a church that you will
[46:14] call a home
[46:15] church where you comfortable where you
[46:18] are fed where your spirit is at
[46:22] peace where you you know you are eating
[46:24] something which is going to prepare
[46:28] for and then he also said then you dis
[46:31] Fellowship all the other
[46:33] churches you just Fellowship
[46:37] them did he
[46:40] that then he said but don't dis
[46:43] Fellowship the other
[46:46] man visit them when you when you can
[46:51] they're your brothers but we but have a
[46:53] church homeall a place where you pay
[46:56] your
[46:56] ti a place where you support the cause a
[47:00] place where you attend
[47:03] physically
[47:07] service that's a church
[47:11] home Hallelujah but that doesn't make
[47:13] you
[47:15] special it makes you special just like
[47:17] the other brother is
[47:21] speci what what how did denominations
[47:24] form
[47:27] denominations
[47:28] formed by putting a full
[47:33] stop on the
[47:35] Revelation the prophet of God would say
[47:38] here in thean church
[47:41] age if God didn't write a handbook of
[47:43] Creeds and formulas andas to start
[47:50] it to start the
[47:52] church then what right did they have to
[47:55] do to do to do
[47:58] that God powered out his Spirit upon
[48:03] Baptists Methodist Nazar
[48:10] advian Church of God sever so
[48:14] named all these
[48:17] Brethren were brought up on different
[48:23] doctrines by laws
[48:26] Church
[48:27] mans Etc God swept it all onto one
[48:34] side God found all these
[48:38] denominations having their Church
[48:42] manuals by laws and
[48:45] constitutions God took it all he swept
[48:48] it all to one
[48:50] side and he destroyed their
[48:53] dispensational theories
[48:58] and He restored the
[49:00] gift of the
[49:02] spirit
[49:04] proing is the same yesterday today and
[49:10] forever
[49:12] Hallelujah but did those Pentecostal
[49:15] learn their lesson about
[49:19] Organization no sir they organiz right
[49:23] back
[49:24] again and they have their written they
[49:27] have written their own
[49:29] textbooks byw and church manual
[49:34] fellowship with one idea in
[49:38] mind which is to prove that they now
[49:41] have all the
[49:44] truth know all the
[49:48] answers for theight of
[49:52] God who know the
[49:54] way show itto
[49:57] us as God is appointed
[50:01] guides if you felt that way you are on
[50:05] the wrong
[50:07] PA there is no one who has all the
[50:10] answers there is no church who have all
[50:13] the
[50:13] answers there is no Pastor who has all
[50:16] the answers there is no organization who
[50:18] has all the
[50:19] answers only
[50:23] christes every dispens
[50:26] message every Prophet every messenger
[50:30] every true
[50:32] God people to one
[50:35] see that is
[50:38] Christ and why is the message
[50:41] true because the message has no full
[50:45] stop our Prophet told us we believe
[50:49] everything God has
[50:51] revealed plus everything he will reveal
[51:00] our God is
[51:03] unquenchable our God has more in him
[51:07] there is no Full Stop on this
[51:09] message and this message does not point
[51:12] us to
[51:13] William this message does not point us
[51:16] to
[51:18] Jefferson this message points us to
[51:23] Christ that is why it is true
[51:26] that's why I believe it that's why I
[51:29] press it because it is life because is a
[51:33] living
[51:36] God but they haven't got the
[51:40] people they have hybridized
[51:44] themselves like the very groups they
[51:46] came out
[51:48] of if they want to be in the
[51:51] bride they are going to have to come out
[51:53] exactly as their their father
[52:00] did they are like the
[52:02] rest the Revival is
[52:04] over they are trying to leave a name and
[52:07] are
[52:09] dead they took
[52:12] organization all the while talking about
[52:14] the spirit of
[52:16] God they talk about the evidence of the
[52:18] of the Holy
[52:19] Spirit but they
[52:21] forget that the devil can talk T too
[52:27] the confusion of
[52:31] B is in their M and they call it the
[52:34] spirit
[52:36] of now here brother was addressing the
[52:38] pentec by
[52:42] denomination because because they speak
[52:44] in
[52:44] Tong then they felt they are the only
[52:48] right
[52:49] ones but God always has
[52:52] more now even now let us leave even the
[52:54] Pentecost not even in the
[52:57] message oh because God filled people
[52:59] with the Holy Ghost in our
[53:02] church the only right ones but because
[53:05] we cry and Shout the only right because
[53:08] the spirit of God moves in our fellow we
[53:11] are the only right ones everywhere else
[53:14] God is Not There is
[53:15] dead that's the spirit of
[53:18] organization it's not the spirit of the
[53:21] message God does what he wants to do
[53:24] when he want you want to do
[53:27] it I saw the
[53:29] disciples when they saw people casting
[53:31] out
[53:32] demons they ran to Jesus and they said
[53:36] Jesus do you see what happened we found
[53:39] people casting out demons in your
[53:42] name should we stop them Jesus said come
[53:46] on why do you have to stop them are not
[53:49] against
[53:50] us they are for us and let me tell you
[53:53] Church any brother
[53:56] sister who believes what we believe is
[53:59] our brother is our
[54:01] sister when you meet them on the road
[54:04] when you meet them at the airport when
[54:06] you meet them in another country tell
[54:08] them God bless
[54:11] you Hallelujah where do we find
[54:15] Christ brother bam says in what is in
[54:17] what is that in your
[54:21] hand he
[54:23] says and that's the reason that I try to
[54:26] get people before the person nothing in
[54:27] the
[54:30] individual nothing in the individual
[54:32] [Music]
[54:34] thee yes it is in
[54:37] Christ and Christ is in his
[54:40] word do you believe that everybody say
[54:44] Christ is in his
[54:46] work he is
[54:49] identified by his own
[54:53] characteristics praise the name of the
[54:55] Lord but what happens we we have
[55:00] preachers and people and especially
[55:03] preachers who preach to point people to
[55:09] themselves you find it even in local
[55:14] churches thank God for preachers we have
[55:18] here we thank God for the preachers we
[55:20] have
[55:21] here we just point to
[55:24] Christ but if imagine if Brother Martin
[55:26] came to
[55:27] preach and the impression he left after
[55:31] preaching that it is brother martin you
[55:33] have to
[55:37] follow if if brother Prince came here
[55:41] and it's now brother
[55:44] prince who is the real
[55:46] deal brother Marin m is the
[55:50] man if after you preach that's the
[55:54] impression
[55:55] then you never
[55:57] preached you point people to
[56:00] yourself I don't care how powerful you
[56:02] are I don't care how much work you've
[56:05] done for
[56:06] God if after you preach the impression
[56:10] is people must follow
[56:12] you then there's a problem with your
[56:16] ministry what should be the
[56:19] impression impression should be
[56:22] Christ when Paul preached
[56:26] Paul made us fall in love with Jesus
[56:30] Christ when William BR
[56:33] pra he made us to fall in love with
[56:36] Jesus
[56:37] Christ I pray that whenever I preach I
[56:42] should make you to fall in love with
[56:45] Christ out there in the
[56:48] denominations you need to hear the
[56:51] testimonies you know I was this I was
[56:53] that but the man of
[56:56] [Music]
[56:59] what kind of man of
[57:00] God that you're talking about that you
[57:03] can't even remember his
[57:07] La tell us Jesus Christ through the man
[57:11] of
[57:12] God not the man of
[57:15] God not my pastor my
[57:20] Bishop what God
[57:22] did this is the attitude I want us to
[57:24] have here
[57:27] in second let me show you let me show
[57:28] you one preacher who was always pointing
[57:30] to
[57:32] himself samel
[57:35] 15 from verse one because of time I only
[57:38] read in
[57:39] English in
[57:41] luganda and it came to pass after this
[57:43] that absolum prepared his chariots and
[57:45] horses and 50 men to run before him and
[57:49] absolum Rose up early and Stood Beside
[57:51] the way of the Gat and it was so that
[57:54] when en man had that had that that had a
[57:58] controversy came to the king for
[58:00] judgment then Absalom came unto him and
[58:03] said of what city are at thou and he
[58:06] said thy servant is is of one of the
[58:09] tribes of Israel and absum said unto him
[58:11] see thy matters are good and right but
[58:15] there is no man deputed of the king to
[58:18] hear thee so absam said moreover oh that
[58:21] I were made judge in the land that every
[58:25] man who which which has any suit or
[58:28] cause might come unto
[58:30] me and I would do him Justice and it was
[58:35] so that when any man came n to him to do
[58:38] obeses he put forth his hand and took
[58:41] him and kissed
[58:43] him and on this manner did absolum to
[58:47] all Israel that came to the king for
[58:50] judgment so absolum stole the hearts of
[58:53] the men of Israel and we have a lot of
[58:59] pastors my goodness let one person make
[59:02] a
[59:04] mistake to attend their
[59:07] Fellowship don't never see again any
[59:10] other man as a man of
[59:12] [Music]
[59:18] God people were coming to see the king
[59:22] and abs positioned himself
[59:26] at the
[59:28] gate when you would see someone
[59:32] coming what can how can I
[59:35] help and the person would talk
[59:38] about and then he would say you are good
[59:42] and you are
[59:44] right but he said there's no one to hear
[59:47] you the king is
[59:50] busy I wish I was the one who was you
[59:53] know helping you you know
[59:55] if I was the one in your
[59:57] case it would have been
[1:00:00] different pastors that make you feel
[1:00:02] that if it is not them you are going to
[1:00:07] hell some of them actually you come to
[1:00:10] me and tell me Pastor I feel led of the
[1:00:13] Lord to to go join lifebo
[1:00:19] Church what did you say
[1:00:21] brother did you know that I'm anointed
[1:00:24] for you
[1:00:26] did you know if you live here actually
[1:00:28] going on your way
[1:00:31] to did you know you under
[1:00:34] C that's a wrong
[1:00:36] Spirit of
[1:00:38] ab it doesn't point to Christ it points
[1:00:41] to
[1:00:44] himself says if it was me in
[1:00:47] your would have been
[1:00:50] better but I I have that
[1:00:53] opportunity and
[1:00:55] man did a
[1:00:57] mistake to put forth his hand
[1:01:02] to do he give him
[1:01:05] respect AB would
[1:01:07] take pull it to
[1:01:10] himself and
[1:01:13] kiss in other words he would imprint
[1:01:23] himself so that by the time the person
[1:01:27] leaves the only thing he's thinking
[1:01:30] about is
[1:01:35] ABS I wish he was the
[1:01:38] king and the
[1:01:40] King absum thought the king would lose
[1:01:46] popularity and we s we find that because
[1:01:50] of that absolom sto the hearts of the
[1:01:58] we have a lot of
[1:02:00] preachers who want to steal
[1:02:03] men's when they have an opportunity to
[1:02:06] minister they want to prove a
[1:02:09] point the best
[1:02:14] preacher there is one preacher I found I
[1:02:16] have told you of him
[1:02:19] before he mounted the pulpit saying I'm
[1:02:23] when whenever I go
[1:02:26] great things happen Wherever I Go
[1:02:29] miracles happen whenever I preach the
[1:02:32] devil

[1:02:37] be because I am

[1:03:43] Pentecostals people go to their
[1:03:45] churches and and they will tell them
[1:03:48] hallelujah hallelujah I'm seeing the
[1:03:50] real of the
[1:03:52] spirit that someone was bewitching

[1:05:28] DF
[1:05:29] evening I make
[1:05:31] sure that you do not go to another
[1:05:36] church
[1:05:38] church wrong Spirit may
[1:05:40] come because every church
[1:05:43] has come on
[1:05:45] Sir
[1:05:47] spirit let the people come because it is
[1:05:51] in their heart to
[1:05:53] come
[1:05:54] if everybody comes to
[1:05:57] church because they want to come the
[1:05:59] Holy Ghost is bound to
[1:06:02] fall has to come if you come because you
[1:06:05] want to
[1:06:07] come God will visit you if you come
[1:06:10] because you desire
[1:06:12] God you receive God because the only
[1:06:16] thing we
[1:06:20] give amen and a prophet would say here
[1:06:24] is our Prophet
[1:06:25] now of this generation his name is
[1:06:29] William
[1:06:30] BR God used this
[1:06:32] man more than any other man in this
[1:06:37] generation but here is what he
[1:06:40] said I'm
[1:06:42] quoting not for one
[1:06:44] moment do I bring a message to the
[1:06:47] people that they may follow
[1:06:51] me or join my church
[1:06:55] or start some
[1:06:57] fellowship and
[1:06:59] organization I have never done
[1:07:02] that and I will not do that
[1:07:05] now I have no
[1:07:08] interest in those
[1:07:11] things but these
[1:07:13] days
[1:07:15] one one
[1:07:17] fellow
[1:07:19] another
[1:07:21] Mage will
[1:07:22] fall
[1:07:26] you are fishing from my
[1:07:31] bucket begin
[1:07:34] blows but our Prophet
[1:07:36] said I never brought this
[1:07:40] message
[1:07:48] a for people to join my
[1:07:50] church follow
[1:07:52] me I am going to fight with all that is
[1:07:54] in
[1:07:56] me if one brother backslides to the
[1:07:59] [Music]
[1:08:00] world but even if all of you left me
[1:08:04] today and joined
[1:08:07] evening I'm talking to
[1:08:09] you and all of you streaming members of
[1:08:12] here I'll be happy I'll continue
[1:08:16] preaching and others will
[1:08:18] come and if God I'll just say if God you
[1:08:21] have allowed
[1:08:22] me bring to fish them out of the
[1:08:25] world so they can go somewhere else to
[1:08:31] grow Pastor do you mean it yes
[1:08:35] I do I have another heaven to take
[1:08:38] it do I have a special heav to take you
[1:08:40] to there's only one Heaven that you are
[1:08:43] taking people
[1:08:45] to and every preacher who is preaching
[1:08:47] the truth is taking them to that same
[1:08:51] heav but we believe to stay in the
[1:08:54] fellowship as a member of that
[1:08:56] Fellowship it is going to be your
[1:08:58] personal
[1:09:01] decision and when you do that
[1:09:04] decision stay right with
[1:09:06] this be
[1:09:08] confident be in one place listen to the
[1:09:12] voice of God with all your heart don't
[1:09:15] be too
[1:09:17] UNF there some Believers like
[1:09:22] that
[1:09:24] brother what is your
[1:09:25] fellow I'm
[1:09:28] everywhere not believe in
[1:09:31] fls if you float you will not
[1:09:35] grow because every Ministry has its
[1:09:40] Grace and when you submit yourself under
[1:09:43] a Ministry do that with all your
[1:09:46] heart and then God will mature
[1:09:49] you under that Ministry because he says
[1:09:52] he has sent that Shepherd
[1:09:59] praise the name of the Lord I have no
[1:10:02] interest in those
[1:10:03] things but I do have interest in the
[1:10:07] things of God and people I have interest
[1:10:11] in people also and in the things of God
[1:10:14] and if I can accomplish just one
[1:10:18] thing I will be
[1:10:20] satisfied that one thing is to see
[1:10:24] established a true spiritual
[1:10:30] relationship between God and
[1:10:34] man wherein men become New Creations in
[1:10:40] Christ filled with his
[1:10:42] spirit and living according to his
[1:10:46] word and I would
[1:10:48] invite plead and warn all to hear his
[1:10:52] voice at this time
[1:10:55] and yield your lives completely
[1:10:57] to even as I trust in my
[1:11:00] heart I have given my all to
[1:11:04] him God bless you and may his coming
[1:11:08] rejoice and that's the reason why we
[1:11:12] organize youth
[1:11:15] meetings they coming from
[1:11:18] everywhere we estimated about 450
[1:11:20] because the registrations had issues but
[1:11:22] we had much more than
[1:11:27] from more than n
[1:11:29] countries and streaming from all over
[1:11:31] the
[1:11:32] world what is
[1:11:34] the it is not to draw crowds to
[1:11:38] D see a
[1:11:41] generation a
[1:11:43] generation that is having a spiritual
[1:11:45] encounter with
[1:11:48] God since the youth meetings I've been
[1:11:50] receiving testimonies after
[1:11:52] testimon
[1:11:54] great things God has
[1:11:55] done many count all over the
[1:11:58] world maybe I'll read a few for you
[1:12:00] along the way but I tell you God is God
[1:12:04] and when he raises a Ministry any man is
[1:12:08] Raising you by the
[1:12:09] princess any man he will
[1:12:11] raise you had a testim
[1:12:14] pastor any man he will raise raing for
[1:12:17] one purpose not to have a following but
[1:12:21] to bring people into a spiritual
[1:12:23] Encounter With Jesus
[1:12:28] Christ Hallelujah God bless you may
[1:12:30] stand on your

[1:18:51] baptism pool yesterday
[1:18:54] on
[1:18:56] Sunday and he called me today and told
[1:18:58] me I met a certain lady and she said Bap
[1:19:01] and she also like to come to
[1:19:07] Fellowship you have words to Greer
[1:19:12] sister let us give her that opportunity
[1:19:15] if you want to come
[1:19:17] here and
[1:19:19] us in one
[1:19:21] minute
[1:19:23] hallelujah praise
[1:19:25] God um actually I just felt the need to
[1:19:29] be rebap
[1:19:32] tized my name is
[1:19:35] Aisha I spent um most of my life um away
[1:19:39] from
[1:19:42] Uganda so I I got born again in the
[1:19:46] UK in my formative
[1:19:48] years in my fortive
[1:19:51] years
[1:19:54] okay so I also served in
[1:19:57] Ministry for three
[1:19:59] years but then along the
[1:20:02] way I had some tragic
[1:20:06] events and I've not been
[1:20:09] back to serving the
[1:20:12] lord but here in
[1:20:14] Uganda I bless God for
[1:20:17] the for the reward of the
[1:20:21] day know yeah because I had um a problem
[1:20:25] with finding okay I I fellowshipped at
[1:20:28] uh Christian Life
[1:20:30] Ministry I had a problem of finding the
[1:20:33] right
[1:20:34] church because of some of the words that
[1:20:37] is it Pastor
[1:20:41] tamale you know we tend to be following
[1:20:44] the men of
[1:20:46] God uh that are pointing to
[1:20:50] themselves an old reference
[1:20:54] is to
[1:20:55] them like he
[1:20:57] preached and he said for example you
[1:21:00] hear people
[1:21:06] say the god of the man I don't want to
[1:21:09] say name of names
[1:21:12] names I don't think it's
[1:21:14] right because the Bible says that we
[1:21:18] overcome the
[1:21:20] um by the testimony
[1:21:23] so when we're giving
[1:21:25] testimon we have to give glory to
[1:21:28] God but we just uh we just
[1:21:32] thank for the vess that's being used we
[1:21:35] appreciate the V that's used I find um
[1:21:40] certain
[1:21:42] phrases Al Born
[1:21:44] Again In the Pentecostal
[1:21:51] Church I'll
[1:21:53] testify when God I'll testify if God
[1:21:57] does this so we just depended on
[1:22:00] him because he gives us
[1:22:04] visas he he heals us he delivers us but
[1:22:09] we're supposed to follow
[1:22:11] him in good and in
[1:22:14] bad and that our
[1:22:17] identity Jesus Christ but not what we
[1:22:20] have or who we follow
[1:22:23] so bless you for the word
[1:22:25] today
[1:22:29] amen amen we appreciate this sister
[1:22:32] Aisha it was certainly God who led you
[1:22:34] to meet our brother
