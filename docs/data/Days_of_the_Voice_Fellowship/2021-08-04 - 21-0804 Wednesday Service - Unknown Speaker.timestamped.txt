[29:54] just commit this evening
[29:56] and the service into your hands in the
[29:58] precious name of jesus christ
[30:00] [Music]
[30:04] i just want to welcome you to the
[30:07] service this evening
[30:09] in the name of our lord jesus and at
[30:11] this time i think i should uh
[30:15] work on projecting that the video
[30:18] that i promised that i would be
[30:21] sharing today now the one we put up on
[30:25] youtube i think by now
[30:26] it should be running by 6 45 so by now
[30:30] it's already running maybe
[30:31] yes but we shall have to replace it with
[30:35] the one we are going to watch because
[30:37] the editing had some few problems so to
[30:40] those of you who have been following up
[30:42] on this video i'm really wanting to
[30:45] encourage you
[30:46] to usually have your book i don't know
[30:49] because this is
[30:50] a continuation of our bible studies on
[30:53] tuesdays
[30:54] are you hearing me on tuesdays and on
[30:56] friday
[30:57] so this is also a study on its own
[31:01] it's talking about the dispensation of
[31:04] the gentiles i think
[31:05] one of one service i'll have to do
[31:06] questions and answers whereby
[31:09] i am the one asking questions and you
[31:11] are the ones giving the answers because
[31:13] we need to know and to be sure that we
[31:14] are following
[31:15] and understanding what it is that we are
[31:16] talking about amen
[31:19] so please listen carefully i really need
[31:21] your undivided attention
[31:23] as you listen to uh uh to the south to
[31:27] to this video and i hope that it can be
[31:30] a blessing to you
[31:52] and that we know that there is going to
[31:54] be a bride
[31:55] and there's going to be a wedding supper
[31:58] served in the skies
[32:00] that's just as sure to be as god is
[32:03] because it's his word
[32:07] come out over my people said the
[32:13] your lord your self-style thing i will
[32:16] receive yourself lord
[32:20] greetings to you once again uh my
[32:22] brother and sister who's listening to us
[32:24] my name is
[32:28] welcome to the voice of the days of the
[32:30] voice broadcast
[32:33] days of the voice i trust that this will
[32:35] be a blessing to you
[32:39] now we're just picking up from where we
[32:41] left from
[32:42] together pretending we killed our way to
[32:44] our command and we are just dealt with
[32:46] the first church age
[32:51] and i'd like you to look at verse eight
[32:52] in your bible in chapter two of the book
[32:54] of revelations
[32:59] and just it says
[33:02] and unto the angel of the church in this
[33:04] manner right this thing says the
[33:06] first and the last witch was dead and is
[33:07] alive i know they works and tribulation
[33:10] and poverty but that had reached
[33:12] and i know that blasphemy of them which
[33:14] said that they are jews and are not
[33:16] are the synagogues of saturn for none of
[33:18] these of those things
[33:20] which thou shalt suffer before the devil
[33:23] shall
[33:23] cast some of you into prison that he may
[33:26] be tried and he that he shall have
[33:28] tribulation 10 days
[33:30] be thou faithful and to death and i will
[33:32] give thee a crown of life
[34:19] and we noticed that this was the time
[34:22] that in the church of jesus christ was
[34:24] under india's persecution
[34:31] and in this church age
[34:35] [Music]
[34:44] which actually was a substance used to
[34:47] embalm the day
[34:52] but also it was a bitter substance
[34:56] so two things out of that which is
[34:58] bitterness
[34:59] and death cathy one
[35:13] and as you notice here on versus
[35:16] uh just turn back to where we've just
[35:19] read
[35:20] whatever and it took that one remember
[35:21] to vote he says
[35:24] verse 10 fear none of these things which
[35:26] thou shalt suffer
[35:27] before the devil shall cast some of you
[35:29] into prison
[35:31] that he may be tried and that he shall
[35:34] have tribulation 10 days
[35:36] be thou faithful and to death and i will
[35:38] give thee a crown of life
[35:59] [Music]
[36:09] who persecuted the believers
[36:13] for us 10 years
[36:18] but god gave them grace now you can turn
[36:20] them away to stand for the truth
[36:23] hold on to the wise
[37:03] [Music]
[37:04] i'm just going through it quite fast
[37:18] [Music]
[37:20] with the two agents
[37:30] i know that it works even where suddenly
[37:33] it is
[37:44] [Music]
[37:47] a stumbling block before the children of
[37:49] israel to eat things sacrificed unto
[37:51] idols and to commit fornication
[37:53] so as to thou also then that all the
[37:55] doctrine of the nicolas
[37:57] which thing is
[38:22] this is the generation where the church
[38:24] and the state
[38:26] came together
[38:40] remember this was the same period in
[38:44] 325.80
[38:45] [Music]
[39:12] [Music]
[39:21] [Music]
[39:40] uh
[39:45] they put a hierarchy never taken
[39:49] a man whom they called or the one that
[39:52] was seated on behalf of god
[40:09] you antichrist you know everything that
[40:12] is anti-world is antichrist
[40:17] and so from that time we see that even
[40:20] the bible itself says that's where
[40:22] saturn is sick
[40:24] [Music]
[40:37] [Music]
[41:11] [Music]
[41:31] and this went on until uh
[41:34] until 606.
[41:37] [Music]
[41:40] then came another generation
[41:46] before
[42:00] remember
[42:36] [Music]
[42:48] [Music]
[43:03] [Music]
[43:23] and we see that this is happening
[43:32] [Music]
[43:38] he
[44:00] teaches something that is not in the
[44:01] scripture then are you going to
[44:03] go with what scripture says or what is
[44:20] there
[44:33] the bible speaks about from verse 18.
[44:38] [Music]
[44:54] [Music]
[45:21] [Music]
[45:44] is
[46:27] you ever been into what you're saying on
[46:28] the bible it's the spirit of jesus
[46:32] whenever you see a woman wanting to
[46:33] dominate
[46:36] to take over that's a spirit of jesus
[46:43] [Music]
[46:55] [Music]
[47:01] [Music]
[47:08] of a child canisters
[47:13] [Music]
[47:15] [Applause]
[47:17] she took over the people to control the
[47:20] people
[47:20] yes they do they
[47:25] [Music]
[47:50] the
[48:00] [Music]
[48:04] is
[48:33] [Music]
[49:15] [Music]
[49:28] they came
[49:41] on others
[49:50] [Music]
[49:56] he
[49:58] [Music]
[50:09] [Music]
[50:55] [Music]
[51:19] was uh uh a a man of the love goats
[51:26] in the street for the truth even when
[51:30] the rest rejected the truth at that time
[51:46] [Music]
[53:12] where
[53:48] [Music]
[54:05] and that we know that there is going to
[54:07] be a brand
[54:08] and there's going to be a wedding supper
[54:11] served in the sky
[54:13] that's just as sure to be as god is
[54:16] because it's his word
[54:20] come out over my people said the lord
[54:36] lord
[54:38] god bless you god bless you all
[54:41] now i
[54:45] i'd just like to just add a few things
[54:47] from what we have had
[54:48] the video which we were streaming
[54:52] it's just a continuation of the first
[54:54] three
[54:55] that we have already streamed for the
[54:57] last three wednesdays
[55:00] so we we
[55:03] we are also putting this on the app
[55:05] maybe just to inform you
[55:08] if you do not know some of you already
[55:10] on your phone
[55:12] you have a google podcast you can even
[55:15] check it now if you can if you're not
[55:16] using your phone
[55:19] google podcast you already have google
[55:20] podcast there
[55:22] and you can just go inside google
[55:24] podcast and type
[55:26] days of the voice fellowship and then be
[55:28] able to get these clips as we
[55:29] we upload them there also the service
[55:32] yesterday is already up there
[55:33] how many have already been able to see
[55:34] it let me see your hands those of you
[55:36] who are here
[55:36] yeah only one huh
[55:40] yeah the subs of yesterday yes it's
[55:42] already on google podcast and also if
[55:44] you even if you're using apple
[55:46] uh there is a uh apple podcast
[55:50] for those who are using up apple yes i
[55:53] also see brother peter's got it so
[55:56] you there are also other applications of
[55:58] course
[56:00] there are quite very many that we are on
[56:02] but i thought
[56:03] it's just uh necessary i mean at least
[56:06] if you have android you will have to get
[56:08] google podcast if you do not have
[56:10] android and you have
[56:11] a iphone then you can be able to get it
[56:14] from your uh
[56:16] from your upper podcast the rest you can
[56:18] just start it if you are using another
[56:20] podcast app
[56:21] so that is for those who just want to
[56:23] listen maybe when they are doing
[56:24] something else or walking or running or
[56:27] or you know doing something or driving
[56:31] whichever it is you can be able to get
[56:32] it from there
[56:34] in audio format and then be able to
[56:36] listen to it
[56:37] uh maybe you want to recommend it to a
[56:39] friend someone who is not in the message
[56:41] and they would like you'd love them to
[56:43] listen so
[56:44] just do not be the whole service we also
[56:47] put
[56:48] just those those clips of the audios you
[56:51] know friends
[56:52] to me i think it's later than we think
[56:54] and i believe i don't know what each of
[56:56] you really believes and really is
[56:57] convicted in your heart
[56:59] but why are we doing all this we are not
[57:02] doing all this to introduce ourselves to
[57:04] the people
[57:06] you see i believe that each of us has a
[57:09] responsibility to do whatever they can
[57:11] to reach out to the others and tell them
[57:13] about what god is doing in this
[57:14] generation
[57:15] now i am not going to wait for someone
[57:17] else to do it for me because when i go
[57:18] before the lord
[57:19] he will ask me what did i do personally
[57:23] you know what what did i do what did you
[57:26] do
[57:27] so as an individual each of us should do
[57:29] something not only on the church
[57:31] uh a platform or on the church level
[57:34] or you know pastoral level ministers
[57:37] level
[57:37] church level some people wait for others
[57:40] to do things and they
[57:41] then they can be able to do i i would
[57:43] like each of you to take this
[57:45] responsibility
[57:46] upon yourself well but the bottom side
[57:48] if you can't go
[57:50] support someone else who is going so if
[57:52] you cannot do this
[57:54] and it has already been done then you
[57:56] have a phone share it with someone
[57:58] who might be blessed you never know what
[58:00] a lord will do some of these things
[58:01] already you you already used to eat
[58:03] you'll be like well i will share it with
[58:05] you now you know me i already know
[58:07] everything
[58:08] now why do i have to share it after all
[58:10] you know
[58:11] well you might not need to know you
[58:14] might not you
[58:14] you might not find the reason why you
[58:16] have to share it but i assure you
[58:18] you share it with somebody someone will
[58:21] hear it
[58:21] and someone will believe they will all
[58:24] not believe
[58:25] but someone will believe those who are
[58:27] ordained to this life
[58:29] those who are dead to this word will
[58:30] hear it and they will believe it
[58:32] so do all that you can send it out and
[58:35] reach out to a friend and tell them what
[58:37] god is doing in this day and
[58:38] encourage them to listen to the podcasts
[58:40] or the youtube videos or
[58:42] or even meet them and evangelize to them
[58:45] and do whatever you can
[58:47] i believe once we have finished our
[58:49] battle here
[58:50] we will know indeed it was worth it all
[58:53] right
[58:53] now in this video as i i'm just
[58:56] concluding here
[58:57] we were able to talk about a few things
[59:00] uh
[59:00] you know about uh what good was doing in
[59:02] the ages but
[59:03] you see i can never emphasize over
[59:06] emphasize that part of the
[59:07] nicolas you know that spirit is now
[59:11] no longer working only the denominations
[59:13] but it is pushing its way
[59:15] in even among the believers and you find
[59:18] that you know one day i i i know we are
[59:20] streaming this so i will not mention the
[59:22] the names of uh the churches and the
[59:25] people
[59:26] because it could be watched so i one day
[59:29] i was in nairobi
[59:30] and i was in a certain church and this
[59:32] was a believer's church it's quite a
[59:34] large church
[59:35] and then they were going to have the
[59:36] lord's supper that evening and then a
[59:38] young lady came in
[59:40] and she was from another church but she
[59:41] had come to fellowship in this church
[59:43] so she's also from another church of the
[59:45] message and another large church so
[59:48] when she came in and they noticed that
[59:50] they were doing
[59:51] uh she knows that they were doing
[59:52] communion she said i will not
[59:55] partake of it i will not partake of it
[59:57] you know everybody was shocked
[59:59] why wouldn't you partake of it well
[1:00:01] because this is not my church you know
[1:00:03] my church
[1:00:04] is the other i was actually personally
[1:00:06] shocked i was like what
[1:00:07] you mean you can only partake of
[1:00:08] communion in your
[1:00:11] church what do you mean by
[1:00:14] message doesn't have different churches
[1:00:16] the message is one
[1:00:18] christ is one and there is only one
[1:00:19] church of jesus christ
[1:00:21] we are only the different fellowships
[1:00:23] that's why when you
[1:00:24] are excommunicated from one
[1:00:28] body of believers you are excommunicated
[1:00:30] from the entire body of christ
[1:00:33] when you are blessed in one body of
[1:00:35] believers you are blessed in the entire
[1:00:37] body of christ
[1:00:38] when you are elected as a deacon in one
[1:00:40] body of christ you are in one body of
[1:00:42] believers you are a deacon all over the
[1:00:44] body of jesus christ do you know that if
[1:00:45] you are a minister
[1:00:47] in the body of a believer somewhere you
[1:00:50] are a minister
[1:00:50] all over the entire body of jesus christ
[1:00:52] all over the world so
[1:00:54] this there's nothing like my church the
[1:00:56] other church their church we are
[1:00:57] believers of the message
[1:00:59] and we must know that we have come out
[1:01:02] of denominations and we
[1:01:03] we must never accept to be laid by
[1:01:06] denominational ideas
[1:01:07] whereby you are limited the holy spirit
[1:01:09] is limited to use you
[1:01:11] to one area to one group of people to
[1:01:13] you know the holy spirit will use you
[1:01:15] everywhere you go as long as you are you
[1:01:17] know led by the holy spirit
[1:01:20] and you know i'm going to read you two
[1:01:22] quotes some of you
[1:01:23] who have already been following this you
[1:01:25] have had this because you have started
[1:01:26] on it
[1:01:27] uh but i just thought i should i should
[1:01:30] read this and this i sent it to a
[1:01:32] brother
[1:01:33] he said but uh in the ephesian church
[1:01:36] age
[1:01:37] the ephesians church age it says the
[1:01:40] order
[1:01:40] of the temple service is also very
[1:01:42] revealing they were
[1:01:43] talking about the temple that was the
[1:01:45] temple of that woman what was her name
[1:01:47] someone remind me
[1:01:49] yes diana yes the type of diana in
[1:01:53] ephesus and uh so the order of the
[1:01:56] temple is trying to talk about it and
[1:01:57] then he says there were
[1:01:58] first of all priests who were eunuchs
[1:02:01] this terrible priest
[1:02:02] would precede that sterility over people
[1:02:05] who would
[1:02:06] drift from the world for a people who
[1:02:08] claim to know god
[1:02:10] apart from the word uh baron
[1:02:13] or life uh sorry about enough life
[1:02:17] as instead as is a sterile unit
[1:02:20] secondly the temple had within its
[1:02:22] confines
[1:02:23] the virgin priestesses who performed the
[1:02:26] religious
[1:02:26] acts of the temple now these are virgins
[1:02:29] meaning they cannot they have not
[1:02:30] brought forth life
[1:02:31] and these are eunuchs meaning they
[1:02:32] cannot bring forth life
[1:02:34] so we have two different types of people
[1:02:36] who were the ones that were prevalent in
[1:02:38] this temple of diana
[1:02:40] yeah if you can share the quote for us
[1:02:42] that will be wonderful
[1:02:43] okay then he says secondly now of course
[1:02:46] we're looking at the temple of diana but
[1:02:48] then he says this temple of diana
[1:02:50] had this type of people inside that
[1:02:52] temple so even today we have churches
[1:02:55] which are actually like the temple of
[1:02:57] diana we have people who cannot bring
[1:02:59] forth life
[1:03:00] secondly the temple had within its
[1:03:02] confines the virgin priestesses who
[1:03:03] performed the religious acts of the
[1:03:05] temple
[1:03:05] this showed further the day that that
[1:03:08] ceremony and form ritual
[1:03:09] that ceremony and form are you following
[1:03:12] me here
[1:03:12] that ceremony and form ritual and works
[1:03:15] would take the place of the holy spirit
[1:03:17] no longer would the charismatic
[1:03:18] manifestation
[1:03:19] feel the temple of god please i would
[1:03:21] like you to emphasize on that
[1:03:22] he says that that the people we are no
[1:03:25] longer
[1:03:26] following or being led like oh you know
[1:03:30] what what was in the temple was no
[1:03:32] longer the charismatic manifestation of
[1:03:35] the spirit
[1:03:36] you know but what was it he he
[1:03:39] you know the holy spirit something else
[1:03:41] had overtaken it and he said what had
[1:03:43] overtaken it number one ceremony number
[1:03:46] two
[1:03:47] form number three rachel number four wax
[1:03:51] and i wonder whether or not believers
[1:03:54] have not reached that level
[1:03:55] whereby they only look at the rituals
[1:03:57] they do the ceremonies they do the forms
[1:04:00] of their form of religion and the works
[1:04:02] they do
[1:04:03] and they thought that this was to be a
[1:04:04] believer but actually to be a believer
[1:04:07] you must be led by the holy spirit you
[1:04:08] must receive the holy spirit in your
[1:04:10] life
[1:04:10] whereby he leads you every moment of
[1:04:12] your life when you are even going to say
[1:04:14] something wrong or do something wrong or
[1:04:16] or think something wrong the holy spirit
[1:04:18] will
[1:04:19] point you out and tell you not to do
[1:04:20] that whereby whereby when you were in
[1:04:23] the church you don't just sit as though
[1:04:24] you are dead because you you have life
[1:04:26] within you
[1:04:26] whereby you respond whereby you you are
[1:04:29] touched by the power of the holy ghost
[1:04:31] and
[1:04:31] there must be manifestation filling the
[1:04:33] temple feeding the house of god
[1:04:36] over them all was the high priest a man
[1:04:38] of the of political power and and public
[1:04:40] influence
[1:04:41] portraying what was already in progress
[1:04:43] you see
[1:04:44] though not too many not not too
[1:04:46] manifested
[1:04:47] that is the church would soon be given
[1:04:49] over to the leadership of a man
[1:04:52] this is where i wanted to come to in
[1:04:53] connection to the the the nicolaitan
[1:04:55] spirit
[1:04:57] the church would soon be given over to
[1:04:58] the leadership of a man with manny's
[1:05:00] plans and manny's ambitions and that's a
[1:05:02] holy ghost would no longer be a living
[1:05:04] reality you know it's now
[1:05:06] all about a man and what what the man
[1:05:08] wants to do
[1:05:09] it's all about the man and what the man
[1:05:11] is led to do it's all about the man it's
[1:05:13] no longer about the holy ghost
[1:05:15] oh god help us and that we will be able
[1:05:18] to go back
[1:05:18] hallelujah whereby the holy ghost will
[1:05:21] be able to lead
[1:05:22] us amen whereby we will not allow
[1:05:25] ourselves
[1:05:26] at any time to be led by uh by man or to
[1:05:29] be led by our own instincts but to be
[1:05:31] led by the holy ghost hallelujah
[1:05:34] amen and the other and underneath them
[1:05:36] all were the tempest slaves who had no
[1:05:38] choice but obedience for the religious
[1:05:40] hierarchy
[1:05:41] and that is supposed to be the believers
[1:05:42] now they're just there as slaves whereby
[1:05:45] all you have to do the pastor said it i
[1:05:47] mean the pastor said it
[1:05:48] right the pastor said it true the pastor
[1:05:51] said it you don't even need to know
[1:05:52] whether it is in the word or not
[1:05:55] we are the church of jesus christ
[1:05:58] not the church of a certain certain
[1:06:01] pastor
[1:06:02] we must be laid by the holy spirit
[1:06:05] we have come out of the denominations
[1:06:07] which we are led by
[1:06:09] men like the pope men like the high
[1:06:12] priests whatever they call them
[1:06:14] we have come out of it we have come out
[1:06:16] that's why we do not have a
[1:06:17] headquarter you find our headquarters
[1:06:20] here no
[1:06:20] our headquarters in heaven and our
[1:06:23] archbishop is jesus christ
[1:06:24] therefore it means we each of us must be
[1:06:27] led by the holy ghost yes
[1:06:28] but abandon somewhere there you go down
[1:06:30] there he says he believes in
[1:06:32] men being controlling the church but by
[1:06:34] by the holy ghost
[1:06:36] you know when they okay you've gone too
[1:06:38] far
[1:06:40] hallelujah
[1:06:43] yes right there what this mean
[1:06:47] what can this mean but the day would
[1:06:49] come when the vested clergy
[1:06:51] by political maneuvering state health
[1:06:54] and the substitution of word and spirit
[1:06:57] for creeds
[1:06:58] dogmas and human leadership would
[1:07:00] enslave the laity
[1:07:01] while the later meeting the believers
[1:07:04] while the leaders
[1:07:05] luxuriated in ill-gotten wealth
[1:07:08] and enjoyed their filthy pleasures and
[1:07:11] the poor people
[1:07:12] who were to be served according to god
[1:07:14] now became the servants
[1:07:16] did you know that actually the true
[1:07:19] preachers
[1:07:20] the true ministers are supposed to be
[1:07:22] the servants
[1:07:24] did you know that i am a servant
[1:07:27] i am only but a servant i do what
[1:07:30] he tells me to do and you are the child
[1:07:34] of god
[1:07:35] you are the main thing i am the main
[1:07:38] thing anyone who is preaching to me
[1:07:40] must preach to me christ if they can't
[1:07:42] preach to me christ i do not want to
[1:07:44] know
[1:07:45] and who is christ christ is the word
[1:07:47] christ is the message
[1:07:49] christ is the bible christ is the word
[1:07:51] of god revealed in our day
[1:07:53] if any preacher preaches something
[1:07:54] outside of that he is not preaching
[1:07:56] christ
[1:07:58] and i read the last quote here in the
[1:08:00] message the ephesians church age
[1:08:02] he says now what was the spiritual
[1:08:05] climate of that church
[1:08:07] it had left its first love the spiritual
[1:08:10] climate of the first church
[1:08:11] of the church rather had left its first
[1:08:14] love
[1:08:15] leaving its first love of the word of
[1:08:17] god was revealed to us
[1:08:18] as having fallen from its origin which
[1:08:21] was pentecost so the origin of the
[1:08:23] church was pentecost but the church had
[1:08:25] now by this time
[1:08:26] fallen away from it in a plain english
[1:08:30] that means this church was in danger of
[1:08:33] being taken away from the leading
[1:08:35] of the holy spirit you see how important
[1:08:37] it is
[1:08:38] the control of the spirit you see god
[1:08:40] wants the church to be in control to be
[1:08:42] under the control of the spirit can you
[1:08:44] say amen to that
[1:08:46] this was exactly what took place after
[1:08:49] moses led
[1:08:50] israel out of egypt the way of god was
[1:08:52] to lead them by the cloud of fire
[1:08:55] prophetic utterance miracles and signs
[1:08:58] and god given wonders this was to be
[1:09:01] accompanied by god
[1:09:02] selected god ordained and god equipped
[1:09:05] and god sent men
[1:09:07] hallelujah with the whole camp being
[1:09:10] dominated by a holy ghost move
[1:09:12] you see all of us being dominated you
[1:09:14] know domination is whereby
[1:09:17] someone is controlling you you know when
[1:09:20] we they were talking about the spirit of
[1:09:21] jezebel where it was wherever it was
[1:09:23] dominating over the church
[1:09:24] but in this case it's not the spirit of
[1:09:26] jesus but the spirit of jesus
[1:09:27] is the spirit of religion you know
[1:09:30] whereby you find people even in the
[1:09:31] message but having religious spirits on
[1:09:33] them
[1:09:34] but here we find out whereby god is
[1:09:36] saying no
[1:09:37] the men that are preaching are going
[1:09:39] selected god ordained god equipped god
[1:09:41] sent and also the whole camp meaning the
[1:09:44] old church
[1:09:45] the old group of believers is dominated
[1:09:48] by a holy ghost move oh i want to be
[1:09:51] that kind of church hallelujah
[1:09:52] whereby we are all dominated by a holy
[1:09:55] ghost move
[1:09:56] whereby the holy spirit will tell you go
[1:09:57] on the streets somewhere and talk about
[1:09:59] me wherever you tell you speak to that
[1:10:00] man about chris whatever you
[1:10:02] it will tell you you have done something
[1:10:03] wrong before you even know you have done
[1:10:05] something wrong
[1:10:06] whereby you will correct you wherever
[1:10:07] you will guide you ever you will let you
[1:10:09] know what to do
[1:10:10] you know the pastor will only be there
[1:10:11] to just say
[1:10:13] yes just be another voice too because
[1:10:15] the bible says by the word
[1:10:16] of two or three witnesses a word shall
[1:10:18] be established so if the holy spirit
[1:10:20] leads you
[1:10:21] and he leaves another or two in the same
[1:10:22] direction then you will surely know it
[1:10:24] is the holy spirit
[1:10:25] that's what brother andrew was trying to
[1:10:26] say even yesterday you see you will be
[1:10:28] able to lead the whole believers
[1:10:30] in in the same channel i don't know i do
[1:10:32] believe he was not trying to say that
[1:10:34] it is the church which is going to
[1:10:35] select a wife for you to marry but he
[1:10:36] was trying to say
[1:10:37] that it is it is if the holy spirit
[1:10:40] surely
[1:10:41] runs through you to to make you believe
[1:10:44] that it is
[1:10:45] you're going to marry someone that
[1:10:47] someone holds people will
[1:10:49] agree in another person agree in the
[1:10:51] past agreeing the deacons are great you
[1:10:53] understand
[1:10:54] the holy spirit cannot if you have the
[1:10:56] holy ghost and you believe you're led by
[1:10:57] the holy ghost
[1:10:58] and another person and another one and i
[1:11:00] don't have the holy ghost they will all
[1:11:02] agree with you
[1:11:03] but if they don't agree with you and it
[1:11:05] appears you are the only one who is
[1:11:07] right
[1:11:07] then ask yourself do you have the holy
[1:11:10] ghost
[1:11:12] if you think you have the holy ghost
[1:11:14] then check it out with someone else who
[1:11:16] you think has the holy ghost hallelujah
[1:11:18] who has a testimony of the holy ghost
[1:11:20] then you can be able to know sure you
[1:11:21] are led by the holy spirit because the
[1:11:23] holy spirit
[1:11:24] in every believer will agree you know
[1:11:26] the majority of it that's why even
[1:11:27] sometimes when it comes to electing the
[1:11:29] you know pastor of the church or deacons
[1:11:31] or things like that
[1:11:32] we take the majority why because we
[1:11:34] believe that
[1:11:35] the holy spirit cannot lead all of them
[1:11:38] in the wrong direction
[1:11:39] you see the world camp will be dominated
[1:11:41] by a holy ghost
[1:11:42] move they rebelled and wanted herself
[1:11:46] a set of rules and agreed to go by
[1:11:48] that's why in this message
[1:11:50] we don't have a set of rules can you can
[1:11:52] i hear you say amen
[1:11:53] we don't have a set of creeds to go by
[1:11:56] we don't have any of that
[1:11:57] oh i'm so glad amen that i'm not even
[1:12:00] ruled by a set of rules instead of
[1:12:02] crates
[1:12:03] then they wanted a king then they wanted
[1:12:05] to be exactly like the world
[1:12:07] and went into complete apostasy and
[1:12:09] oblivion
[1:12:10] and oblivion that is exactly how the
[1:12:13] first church
[1:12:14] age started and it will get worse and
[1:12:16] worse and today it is even worse much
[1:12:18] worse
[1:12:19] until the holy spirit is completely
[1:12:21] rejected and god must destroy the people
[1:12:23] and when the holy spirit is completely
[1:12:26] rejected i assure you
[1:12:27] then god will destroy the people but i
[1:12:29] thank god that i'm still here
[1:12:31] and i'm believing in the holy spirit and
[1:12:34] and i and you are believing the holy
[1:12:35] spirit
[1:12:36] and i believe that we will not be
[1:12:37] destroyed will not be denied but we will
[1:12:39] go in the rapture
[1:12:40] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:12:43] lord may god bless you as you
[1:12:45] continually are led of the holy spirit
[1:12:47] everywhere you go
