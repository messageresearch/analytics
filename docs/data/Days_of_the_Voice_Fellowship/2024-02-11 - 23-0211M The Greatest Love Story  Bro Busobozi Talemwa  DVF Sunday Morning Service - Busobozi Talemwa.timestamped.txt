[1:08:07] name of Jesus
[1:08:12] Christ to be in the
[1:08:22] of
[1:08:26] uh before we continue I have a testimony
[1:08:30] here this is from Brother Dr Peter
[1:08:34] M he says God bless you I thank God for
[1:08:37] a business
[1:08:42] opportunity a colleague of mine gave me
[1:08:45] to run a medical facility
[1:08:50] in I think uh
[1:08:54] H the way he told me the testimony he
[1:08:57] ought to have changed these
[1:09:00] [Music]
[1:09:02] words because it was
[1:09:06] unbelievable but it was in
[1:09:08] prayer he lost his job some years some
[1:09:11] months
[1:09:14] ago but he just said you know someone
[1:09:16] just telling him you know I have several
[1:09:20] hospitals and I want you to help me
[1:09:24] to take over this
[1:09:26] one so do you think that is a
[1:09:30] man that is God so you should have said
[1:09:34] God gave me to run a medical
[1:09:39] facility so he says I he knew the person
[1:09:42] is calling a friend of his he knew him
[1:09:44] for the first
[1:09:48] time and they they met when he was
[1:09:50] trying to help him to register a clinic
[1:09:52] in NAA
[1:09:54] [Music]
[1:09:56] and through that instruction in the
[1:09:58] process through that interaction in the
[1:10:00] process
[1:10:01] rather he told me of a medical facility
[1:10:04] that he doesn't have time to
[1:10:08] run and uh his new uh and he needed to
[1:10:14] cut cost his
[1:10:17] costs and so he asked him if he could be
[1:10:21] able to take it as a manager and he
[1:10:22] accepted
[1:10:29] and so actually the brother even paid
[1:10:32] the one month rent and he has started to
[1:10:34] run it
[1:10:44] already he didn't want to say it but I
[1:10:47] believe there was was given to him
[1:10:49] believe every footstep is
[1:10:52] possession
[1:10:54] so we want to thank God for that
[1:10:58] testimony for brother Dr
[1:11:01] M we believing for
[1:11:05] more God knew that it
[1:11:10] ising for the funds for the
[1:11:16] church and he has already started
[1:11:18] opening doors for the
[1:11:22] people amen
[1:11:24] I also had a testimony of open offer
[1:11:26] Brother
[1:11:29] Joseph we bless the name of the
[1:11:31] Lord uh so to those of you who did not
[1:11:34] attend our meeting on
[1:11:38] Sunday would like to let you know that
[1:11:40] we uh we instituted uh a new
[1:11:47] system of being able to do fundraising
[1:11:50] for our
[1:11:52] land and and H we instituted a system
[1:11:56] whereby we shall
[1:11:57] have uh seven
[1:12:03] groups and in each
[1:12:05] group there is a team
[1:12:08] leader and who is responsible for
[1:12:11] fundraising for that
[1:12:15] team so we divided ourself the whole
[1:12:17] church in in in sections of seven
[1:12:22] groups
[1:12:24] I know there are those of you who might
[1:12:26] be here and you're not part of any group
[1:12:31] yet so by the end of the service today
[1:12:34] you we are requesting you to be a part
[1:12:36] of a
[1:12:39] group uh if you know you're not part of
[1:12:41] a
[1:12:42] group which means you are not uh
[1:12:46] participating in this exercise and we
[1:12:48] would like you to be a part of
[1:12:52] one
[1:12:54] uh also members also those
[1:12:59] groups it is up to the leader or the
[1:13:01] team leader of the
[1:13:05] group to do
[1:13:07] fundraising fundraising is not an easy
[1:13:12] process but it is easy if the team
[1:13:15] leader knows what they
[1:13:18] doing and if you know you're
[1:13:22] failing uh you cannot be able to
[1:13:25] coordinate with
[1:13:28] people how do you
[1:13:30] know if you are not bringing
[1:13:33] results then we will ask you to find
[1:13:36] someone else in your group and request
[1:13:38] them to take
[1:13:42] over so uh the brothers requested me
[1:13:45] that I I uh
[1:13:48] take one of the ministers said pastor
[1:13:51] you are the best to handle as the
[1:13:52] chairman
[1:13:57] because the one holding the
[1:14:00] vision but certainly I need
[1:14:03] assistance and since I was voted by
[1:14:08] those Brothers as a
[1:14:12] chairman I was thinking that I also uh
[1:14:16] uh ask someone to assist
[1:14:19] me because we will need someone every
[1:14:22] Sunday here who will be coordinating
[1:14:24] actually every week he will be
[1:14:25] coordinating with every

[1:19:35] about 9 98 99,000 Chings
[1:19:39] [Music]
[1:19:42] short so the leader this month this week
[1:19:46] has been has been Martin
[1:19:50] Luther so let us give a big hand for the
[1:19:52] members and of Martin
[1:19:55] [Music]
[1:19:56] Lu
[1:19:58] amen and number last has been
[1:20:04] Martin we are not clapping for
[1:20:07] Martin we are encouraging
[1:20:11] Martin to do a better
[1:20:14] job now there are some
[1:20:16] groups that have a lot of
[1:20:19] students and the students are not even
[1:20:21] around Ino
[1:20:23] I understand Martin is one of those
[1:20:26] groups and I think
[1:20:28] [Music]
[1:20:30] col so I was thinking what we are going
[1:20:33] to do we are going to put all the
[1:20:34] students the in the lower classes in one
[1:20:40] group as I think sister had suggested
[1:20:43] last
[1:20:46] Sunday is at school now so so that we
[1:20:51] put all the other people who are working
[1:20:53] in all these
[1:20:55] groups and we be sure that contributions
[1:20:58] are coming
[1:21:01] in now the leader of Martin
[1:21:06] Luther to S time I would ask her to come
[1:21:08] and tell us how they were able to make
[1:21:10] it but because I'm a part of that group
[1:21:11] I'll tell you how we were able to make
[1:21:15] [Music]
[1:21:17] it because I'm a member
[1:21:20] of two things were done
[1:21:24] number one when the group WhatsApp group
[1:21:27] was formed
[1:21:29] WhatApp uh by the way our leader was
[1:21:35] Dr but he and I
[1:21:39] talked we agreed I cannot be the leader
[1:21:42] because I'm busy he cannot be the leader
[1:21:43] because he's
[1:21:47] busy with being a team leader you have
[1:21:49] to
[1:21:51] coordinate you know you have to make it
[1:21:55] happen so we notice that these young
[1:21:57] people are very good at
[1:22:01] coordinating and if you want to see all
[1:22:02] the groups that are doing well the team
[1:22:04] leaders are
[1:22:09] sist so some of you who have brothers as
[1:22:11] your team leaders you may want to make
[1:22:13] them
[1:22:19] sisters
[1:22:21] Hallelujah
[1:22:28] now and so because they're really doing
[1:22:31] well they know how to talk to
[1:22:34] people I'm imagining if brother so and
[1:22:36] so called say brother we want money
[1:22:38] immediately you don't even want to give
[1:22:44] anything if a sister calls and says
[1:22:46] brother you did not send your
[1:22:49] contribution okay let me send right now
[1:22:57] so so I think some of you groups you may
[1:22:59] want to consider that
[1:23:03] tactic and also this sister that is
[1:23:06] leading our team put up a
[1:23:10] list I know there is this sentiment that
[1:23:13] you know we are not B says if you're
[1:23:17] giving giving secret let not your right
[1:23:20] hand know what your left hand know what
[1:23:23] your right hand has
[1:23:30] given and so some are like I don't want
[1:23:33] to contribute on the
[1:23:35] group because me I'm
[1:23:37] humble but even privately you have not
[1:23:42] contributed it's not
[1:23:44] humility the same Bible says don't pray
[1:23:46] in
[1:23:49] public no the same Bible that said the
[1:23:52] other thing also says we should not pray
[1:23:53] in
[1:23:55] public like the Hypocrites do they come
[1:23:59] in the in the sanctuary and then they
[1:24:00] lift up their
[1:24:02] hands you that is saying you don't want
[1:24:04] to give in
[1:24:05] public you are the one who prays in
[1:24:09] public so you should interpret scripture
[1:24:13] correctly We Are One
[1:24:15] family we are one
[1:24:18] team and we are the body of
[1:24:21] Christ and if you are because we are not
[1:24:24] mentioning people here and what they
[1:24:25] have
[1:24:27] given those are filed because it is in
[1:24:30] your group
[1:24:32] [Music]
[1:24:33] team so if you are
[1:24:36] spiritual you will
[1:24:39] contribute you will put your shoulders
[1:24:42] to the
[1:24:44] wheel you will let us achieve the
[1:24:48] goal because you part of the
[1:24:50] body and so uh the sister put up that
[1:24:55] list uh and she was mentioning she kept
[1:24:58] mentioning who is giving how
[1:25:02] much and it motivated others also to
[1:25:06] give the second thing that was done on
[1:25:09] our
[1:25:10] team we were able each individual was
[1:25:13] able some
[1:25:15] individuals to look out for
[1:25:18] friends and we added them on
[1:25:21] our who are not members of the
[1:25:24] church and so they also helped us
[1:25:28] to so you as the team leader and your
[1:25:33] members you can do
[1:25:36] that and make it happen for for your
[1:25:40] team at the end of it all we shall buy
[1:25:43] our church
[1:25:45] land and the Lord shall take the
[1:25:47] glory so uh we will have a very brief
[1:25:53] uh meeting with the team
[1:25:58] leaders to guide them a little
[1:26:03] bit praise the Lord and so before we go
[1:26:06] to the word this
[1:26:08] morning I'd like to do two things
[1:26:11] one I'd like to
[1:26:14] welcome uh sister peace to
[1:26:19] dvf if you could please stand sister
[1:26:24] right over here let us give our
[1:26:27] hand

[1:27:01] time and uh it used to be so beautiful

[1:34:32] heart I want to really thank God for the
[1:34:35] Kenya
[1:34:38] trip and that's why it is good always to

[1:34:46] God really spoke to me and and convinced
[1:34:49] my
[1:34:50] heart
[1:34:53] a lot of things
[1:34:57] happen to the
[1:35:01] extent of
[1:35:06] doubt this young girl I I met her at

[1:35:21] from
[1:35:24] other and I really want to thank God I
[1:35:27] don't have much
[1:35:29] time but if you really need testimony
[1:35:32] there is a lot of testimony between I
[1:35:35] mean connected to our

[1:51:05] Lord will also visit him and give him
[1:51:07] the revelation of the
[1:51:10] word so friends I'm speaking on the
[1:51:13] greatest love
[1:51:16] story and an inspiration the reason why
[1:51:19] Hees the reason why he
[1:51:24] came
[1:51:26] um I've preached this once some place
[1:51:28] and Sh said it was his favorite
[1:51:34] someone I thought that he would love
[1:51:36] this and you all will be blessed by
[1:51:40] this praise the
[1:51:42] Lord for God so loved the
[1:51:45] world that he gave his begotten
[1:51:48] son now love CA him to do
[1:51:52] this caused him to
[1:51:54] G there is something about
[1:51:57] love we cannot be able to uh to replace
[1:52:01] with
[1:52:04] anything and so uh the prophet of God
[1:52:07] says in the message go wake
[1:52:10] Jesus says God in the beginning he
[1:52:13] wasn't
[1:52:16] even he wasn't even
[1:52:18] God I'm happy to see the brother here
[1:52:21] from
[1:52:22] carja there's another one from are you
[1:52:25] Daniel okay God bless you so that God
[1:52:29] wasn't even
[1:52:32] God can I want you to think about what
[1:52:34] I'm
[1:52:35] saying that God wasn't even
[1:52:37] [Music]
[1:52:40] God does it make sense I've never had
[1:52:46] anybody but the prophet of
[1:52:48] Mal
[1:52:51] no Theologian has
[1:52:54] ever no PhD hold has
[1:52:57] ever because it came by
[1:53:02] Revelation now we know that God is he
[1:53:05] says God is an object of
[1:53:09] worship when the Bible says Thou shalt
[1:53:11] have no other gods beside
[1:53:16] me he does not mean like another God
[1:53:19] there be another
[1:53:24] God but he means anything that you
[1:53:28] worship anything you
[1:53:31] R you should not have it's a
[1:53:35] God if it is your phone it is
[1:53:38] your if it is your social media it is
[1:53:42] your if it is someone in your life it is
[1:53:45] your
[1:53:46] god and then he says that thou shall
[1:53:48] have no other God before
[1:53:51] so he's God and is's God by
[1:53:53] himself but when the prophet says there
[1:53:56] was a time when he God wasn't even
[1:54:02] God he has now even go gone beyond the
[1:54:07] the first verse of the Book of
[1:54:12] Genesis the Bible as we know
[1:54:15] it begins with Genesis 1 verse one
[1:54:22] but remember and you know someone asked
[1:54:24] me Pastor who wrote the book of
[1:54:28] Genesis the Book of
[1:54:30] Genesis was is the book that shows the
[1:54:33] beginnings of
[1:54:36] everything and so it must not have been
[1:54:39] a man who knew those
[1:54:41] things it was it is only God who knows
[1:54:44] what was before the beginning and after
[1:54:46] the beginning and during the
[1:54:48] beginning
[1:54:53] God uses human
[1:54:55] beings and those human beings are called
[1:54:59] prophets now God can take a
[1:55:02] prophet a man and take him before
[1:55:05] something
[1:55:07] happened and he shows him what happened
[1:55:10] before it
[1:55:11] happened and he can
[1:55:14] take the same man and show him the
[1:55:18] future and that's why prophetically if
[1:55:21] the spirit of prophec is upon me I can
[1:55:22] be able to speak to you and speak about
[1:55:25] your
[1:55:29] future and those things will happen just
[1:55:32] as exactly as if I knew what was going
[1:55:34] to happen in
[1:55:38] the but then you know what that is
[1:55:42] prophecy but you see there is a gift of
[1:55:46] Prophecy and then there is a prophet who
[1:55:48] is born a prophet
[1:55:51] now a prophet who is born a prophet his
[1:55:53] messages do not need to be tested by
[1:55:55] another
[1:56:00] person but according to scripture if
[1:56:02] someone had a gift of
[1:56:05] Prophecy and maybe just came and
[1:56:07] prophesied over your
[1:56:09] life you don't just believe that and
[1:56:11] take it to be that say the
[1:56:14] Lord if it has been
[1:56:16] judged by other men who are spiritual
[1:56:20] [Music]
[1:56:21] and can say indeed it is of
[1:56:23] god but a prophet like uh like
[1:56:27] Moses he was born a prophet his messages
[1:56:31] did not need to be
[1:56:33] questioned it was thus sayth the
[1:56:35] Lord and we see that God anointed
[1:56:39] Moses and he showed him everything from
[1:56:42] the
[1:56:43] beginning and you know now Moses began
[1:56:45] to
[1:56:46] write you see in the beginning
[1:56:50] God created the Heaven and the
[1:56:52] Earth so now by the time God takes by
[1:56:55] the time you know Moses begins to
[1:56:58] write he did not know he was not there
[1:57:02] but these things were coming to him by
[1:57:04] the spirit of
[1:57:07] Prophecy and now he began writing but by
[1:57:11] the time he began writing God was
[1:57:12] already
[1:57:16] God if you understand it say Amen
[1:57:19] because he said in the beginning
[1:57:22] God but here comes a
[1:57:25] prophet another man who was born a
[1:57:28] prophet in our
[1:57:31] generation William BR and he takes this
[1:57:34] same
[1:57:36] scripture and he even goes before that
[1:57:39] scripture and he says before the
[1:57:44] beginning God wasn't even
[1:57:47] God now that is not written in
[1:57:50] here that can be proved by the same
[1:57:54] Bible If any man comes and speaks in the
[1:57:57] name of the
[1:58:00] Lord if some some whatever he says must
[1:58:03] be proved by what is
[1:58:06] written because God cannot come to this
[1:58:08] prophet and say something contrary to
[1:58:10] what he will say to another
[1:58:14] prophet and so we know that you know the
[1:58:18] the analogy is that God is an object of
[1:58:24] worship and so there was a time that God
[1:58:27] was not
[1:58:29] worship he was
[1:58:32] Elohim he was dwelling with his own
[1:58:36] souling with his own
[1:58:39] attributes he was self
[1:58:42] existent he was a self-existent
[1:58:45] one he had nobody with
[1:58:48] him had no angels with him he had no
[1:58:51] human beings with him he had no animals
[1:58:53] with him he had no nature to worship he
[1:58:56] was gone he was just
[1:58:58] Elohim he was the spirit that gives
[1:59:01] life and the Bible says he was covering
[1:59:05] everywhere and you know he he was
[1:59:07] existing by himself with his own
[1:59:11] attribute just like shame or like any
[1:59:14] young man would Exist by himself before
[1:59:16] he expresses his attributes
[1:59:22] and so there was a
[1:59:24] time God was not
[1:59:26] wor and that time he was not
[1:59:29] God but when did he become
[1:59:33] God because what we see in Genesis 1 one
[1:59:35] he was already
[1:59:38] god well there is other
[1:59:42] creatures that the Bible actually speaks
[1:59:45] of but the Bible does not tell us about
[1:59:48] their creation
[1:59:51] St and those creatures are called
[1:59:55] Angels how many know
[1:59:57] Angels how many have ever received
[2:00:01] anel have ever received
[2:00:03] one if you want to receive an Angelic
[2:00:07] visitation keep good music in your
[2:00:11] house listen to the word of God the
[2:00:14] right
[2:00:15] atmosphere and angels will visit you and
[2:00:19] and so the Angels were
[2:00:22] created the Bible says Angels were
[2:00:25] created we know that from The Book of
[2:00:28] Ezekiel and from also the Book of
[2:00:31] Revelation Angels were
[2:00:34] created when they were
[2:00:36] created we do not know we do not know
[2:00:40] when know what there is no creation
[2:00:44] story for angels in the
[2:00:48] Bible we also know that angels are
[2:00:52] worshippers there is even a band of
[2:00:54] angels that do nothing but worship God
[2:00:57] day and
[2:01:00] night these are not
[2:01:03] Messengers these his
[2:01:05] presence and night all the time and they
[2:01:10] worship him say holy
[2:01:13] H
[2:01:15] the only their one they have two wings
[2:01:19] covering their F two covering
[2:01:21] Theirs to fly with now the Bible speaks
[2:01:25] of all
[2:01:26] that and you know but now the prophet of
[2:01:29] God goes and
[2:01:30] says God became
[2:01:32] God when Angels were
[2:01:36] created so now he was being
[2:01:40] worshiped but there was a time that God
[2:01:43] was not
[2:01:45] God but I'm glad that I was created
[2:01:49] for the purpose of
[2:01:52] wor now of course now there we speak
[2:01:54] about God a little bit but now I want us
[2:01:56] to go to Revelation and I want you to
[2:01:58] hold your thoughts
[2:02:03] together the service today will have a
[2:02:05] little more content than I usually
[2:02:09] give I just want you to keep your
[2:02:11] thoughts
[2:02:13] together and let us see how the holy
[2:02:15] spirit will deal with
[2:02:17] us don't make conclus before we reach
[2:02:19] the
[2:02:22] conclusion because then you will be
[2:02:26] confused Revelation
[2:02:29] 127 and there was war in heaven Michael
[2:02:32] and his angels fought against the dragon
[2:02:34] and the dragon F and his
[2:02:45] angels now before I continue on this
[2:02:47] verse
[2:02:49] are we together church if we together
[2:02:52] say
[2:02:52] Amen now
[2:02:55] God as an object of
[2:02:58] worship began to um Express his
[2:03:04] attributes Elohim the
[2:03:08] self-existence the moment he created
[2:03:11] angels He had begun to express
[2:03:14] himself he then became God the object of
[2:03:20] that was unexpressed attribute of
[2:03:26] God now in the creation
[2:03:29] story we see several things he
[2:03:32] created over
[2:03:34] time and the first thing he created was
[2:03:36] light and
[2:03:38] darkness and he separated the light and
[2:03:41] the
[2:03:42] Darkness and we see the other thing was
[2:03:45] the
[2:03:46] firmament the space between the waters
[2:03:50] do you know the Bible says that that
[2:03:52] that you know the firmament is the space
[2:03:54] between
[2:03:59] water Heaven as we call
[2:04:01] it is actually just a
[2:04:04] space between the waters so there water
[2:04:07] down and water
[2:04:09] up God is
[2:04:11] amazing God is things are in the
[2:04:14] Bible also on the third day dry
[2:04:17] land
[2:04:19] earth water
[2:04:22] sea HS Tre now God was
[2:04:27] intentional there is something I want
[2:04:29] you to see you know you might think that
[2:04:32] God was just trying to play a video
[2:04:36] game to appe himself so whatever he was
[2:04:40] doing he had a main
[2:04:44] reason he had something in his
[2:04:46] heart he had a desire
[2:04:49] he want to express
[2:04:51] himself in such a
[2:04:54] way I want you to follow me here he then
[2:04:57] created now
[2:04:59] lights the greater light to Ru the
[2:05:02] night the less light to Rule the
[2:05:05] Day stars and everything the fth day
[2:05:08] then he
[2:05:11] fish all these were
[2:05:15] attributes God was expressing himself
[2:05:19] and through all
[2:05:21] creation all creation worships
[2:05:24] him see all the birds in the morning
[2:05:27] they wake up and they
[2:05:30] begin there are some birs which were
[2:05:32] even
[2:05:33] recorded early in the morning you know
[2:05:37] you know singing as they
[2:05:39] sing and then they flap their
[2:05:43] we every morning and you see the trees
[2:05:48] you know they was worship him all nature
[2:05:50] worships him fish
[2:05:53] worships and then he did the CLE the and
[2:05:58] all the animals and they
[2:06:01] multiplied
[2:06:02] now after God created all these
[2:06:09] things God still felt
[2:06:15] aoid God was happy and everything was
[2:06:20] good but with him he felt he needed
[2:06:25] something he was
[2:06:29] still can you imagine having all the
[2:06:31] riches of the
[2:06:34] world but you are still
[2:06:36] Lo God was still
[2:06:38] Lo because there was no
[2:06:42] creation that was in his direct
[2:06:47] image he need a
[2:06:50] creation that is in his Perfect
[2:06:54] Image a creation that I can say is
[2:06:57] unexpressed image of his
[2:07:03] person and so God was not happy God was
[2:07:07] still lonely there was none like him but
[2:07:11] he wanted to have
[2:07:13] company he wanted to have someone like
[2:07:17] him can
[2:07:20] someone he can talk to someone that can
[2:07:22] carry
[2:07:24] on do what God was doing let me tell you
[2:07:29] God Amen then say let us create
[2:07:34] man in our
[2:07:37] image amen that is Genesis
[2:07:40] 126 let us make money in our
[2:07:43] image after our likeness and let them
[2:07:46] have dominion over the fish of
[2:07:49] and over the of the and over the C over
[2:07:54] all the Earth and over every
[2:07:58] creeping so now God created man in his
[2:08:03] own image in the image of God created he
[2:08:09] him male and
[2:08:11] female them all right now many people
[2:08:15] say you see the there are three gods
[2:08:19] the Trinity father son Holy Ghost and
[2:08:23] each of them is a God that's why here he
[2:08:25] says let
[2:08:29] us but wait a moment if you want to know
[2:08:32] the nature of
[2:08:33] God you can know the nature of God by
[2:08:36] the creation he created after his
[2:08:43] image the the one he
[2:08:45] created was in His image
[2:08:48] and who was he how many were they one
[2:08:52] man but he said created
[2:08:55] he male and
[2:08:57] female he was one man dwelling with more
[2:09:02] attributes he was one but he was more he
[2:09:07] was one but he was many he was one but
[2:09:10] he was
[2:09:11] overflowing through him he will have
[2:09:15] multiplication through him the word will
[2:09:19] one man he had a lot of
[2:09:24] attributes that's how God
[2:09:27] was God is one is a spirit but he's not
[2:09:32] one like your
[2:09:33] finger God is
[2:09:36] more not more than
[2:09:38] one but I mean God is
[2:09:41] more more than enough you cannot count
[2:09:45] him you cannot number
[2:09:49] because a spirit just like you cannot
[2:09:52] count
[2:09:53] water how many Waters do we
[2:09:56] have
[2:09:59] Victor all
[2:10:01] these but how many waters are
[2:10:05] there one
[2:10:06] water how one like your
[2:10:09] finger not one like your finger but more
[2:10:13] than one more than
[2:10:17] enough how God is God covers the earth
[2:10:21] he covers the heaven he covers the
[2:10:23] mountain did you know that the same God
[2:10:26] who is in
[2:10:27] heaven is the same God here do you know
[2:10:31] he can be in
[2:10:32] heaven can be on at the same
[2:10:36] time but in every place he is there in
[2:10:41] his
[2:10:42] fullness howan the
[2:10:46] attributes make him
[2:10:49] is all
[2:10:50] there just like you see this two
[2:10:53] bottom you know it has
[2:10:55] attributes
[2:10:59] sodium magesium
[2:11:02] chlide
[2:11:04] many many
[2:11:06] attributes and so this is water and that
[2:11:10] is water but these are two bottles of
[2:11:13] water but how many waters are
[2:11:17] there one water come on one
[2:11:21] two what am i counting am i counting
[2:11:25] water one two I'm counting
[2:11:29] bottles so in the same way God can
[2:11:33] bottle
[2:11:34] himself in many
[2:11:37] manifestations in many
[2:11:40] form God is one because everything that
[2:11:44] makes
[2:11:45] God all the attributes of God was
[2:11:48] powered in
[2:11:50] Jesus that did not make Jesus the second
[2:11:54] person it made him the only god of
[2:11:58] Heaven he was in heaven and he was on
[2:12:02] Earth so that's why when he says let us
[2:12:06] create it was God with his
[2:12:09] attributes and of course Angels were
[2:12:11] already
[2:12:12] created but now the man he was
[2:12:14] creating was going to
[2:12:17] manifest perfect image of
[2:12:20] God and so God would then have
[2:12:23] Fellowship but the devil doesn't always
[2:12:26] let the fellowship that
[2:12:29] way among the angels He had
[2:12:32] created you know when they saw that
[2:12:36] there was man in the image of God CH
[2:12:40] follow me I want you that this was would
[2:12:42] be a little
[2:12:45] more follow closely so here are two
[2:12:49] domains there is a domain in heaven and
[2:12:53] there is a
[2:12:54] domain and the domain in heaven was was
[2:12:58] the place the dwelling place of
[2:13:00] God now God blessed
[2:13:04] man on the domain on
[2:13:06] earth now man was the one seated on the
[2:13:09] throne of on the
[2:13:12] earth and God created God was now on the
[2:13:16] on the throne of Heaven
[2:13:19] but now when
[2:13:20] Lucifer Lucifer was one of the angels in
[2:13:25] heaven not just an angel was according
[2:13:28] to the Bible he was one of the closest
[2:13:31] Angelic
[2:13:34] beings theone of
[2:13:38] God high up in
[2:13:41] run he had a lot of
[2:13:43] authority to make things
[2:13:46] happen angels were
[2:13:49] created never
[2:13:51] to Angels were
[2:13:53] created be
[2:13:55] perf but the Bible speaks of
[2:13:58] Lucifer he says Lucifer lufer thou
[2:14:03] perfect you were
[2:14:06] perfect
[2:14:08] evil
[2:14:10] found somehow even in his
[2:14:13] Perfection evil
[2:14:16] was sin was
[2:14:19] and you know when an angel sin an angel
[2:14:21] can never be
[2:14:24] pardoned there is no Redemption for an
[2:14:27] angel when Angels sin they cast away
[2:14:33] forever I thank God I'm not an
[2:14:35] angel I God I'm not an
[2:14:39] angel I'm a human being that is
[2:14:43] redeemable I have within me a seed of
[2:14:47] life is redeemable every a human being
[2:14:51] no matter how much
[2:14:53] Sin from Grace he will always be
[2:14:58] redeemable God will call him out God is
[2:15:01] able to do that prise the name of the
[2:15:04] Lord and so we see when Lucifer
[2:15:07] see you know God just looked at him and
[2:15:10] the and you know Lucifer felt like he
[2:15:13] wanted to lift
[2:15:15] himself with pride to sit
[2:15:20] higher to be something to be
[2:15:24] someone and that's why you should watch
[2:15:28] pride pride comes before the
[2:15:33] fall if you feel you are being lifted
[2:15:36] up if you're feeling better than others
[2:15:40] no matter how much you have achieved in
[2:15:42] life no matter where you are in life you
[2:15:45] will fall down
[2:15:48] humility is the way
[2:15:51] up pride is the way
[2:15:55] down be humble and
[2:15:58] Lucifer say to the
[2:16:00] angels the way I see I know heaven like
[2:16:05] my
[2:16:06] palm like my
[2:16:08] palm and I know God and I know all of
[2:16:11] your
[2:16:12] angels and you know I have very good
[2:16:14] vocal
[2:16:15] cord I'm very good
[2:16:18] yeah yeah we agree you are very
[2:16:20] good I have a proposition to why don't
[2:16:24] you make me your
[2:16:26] God so you can worship me instead of
[2:16:29] woring him me now God saw that now God
[2:16:35] is G so what God
[2:16:39] did he came
[2:16:41] down but how did he come down he came
[2:16:44] down in another
[2:16:46] form
[2:16:49] down in a form of an
[2:16:52] Angel and his name was
[2:16:56] Michael and he came down to show the
[2:17:00] devil to show Lucifer if you think you
[2:17:04] are good I can create another form of
[2:17:07] [Music]
[2:17:08] myself in a way of an
[2:17:11] Angel to come and show you I have better
[2:17:16] what you are
[2:17:18] if I made you and you think you are
[2:17:20] good I have better where this came
[2:17:25] from and when Michael came down Michael
[2:17:29] did not come to
[2:17:31] negotiate Michael did not come to
[2:17:34] agree let us now have an agreement let
[2:17:38] us
[2:17:39] negotiate so that you can take that F
[2:17:42] and I take my God does not
[2:17:45] negotiate with the terrorists
[2:17:48] and the Devil is a
[2:17:49] terrorist is a terrorist if God did not
[2:17:53] negotiate with the devil in
[2:17:55] heaven he cannot negotiate with the
[2:17:57] devil
[2:17:59] here and if the devil is tormenting you
[2:18:01] in your
[2:18:02] life let me tell you God is not about to
[2:18:06] negotiate with
[2:18:08] you God is in you you are not going to
[2:18:12] negotiate without
[2:18:15] Spirit you in your life time has to
[2:18:19] come The Same Spirit which was in Christ
[2:18:23] if it is in you time comes you say no
[2:18:27] enough is enough I am not going to
[2:18:30] negotiate with all these
[2:18:32] demons I'm going to stand as a Son of
[2:18:35] God and I'm going to kick
[2:18:37] them did you know Believers kick out
[2:18:42] demons did you know that we have been
[2:18:46] given the authority
[2:18:48] to cast out demons to cast out Spirits I
[2:18:52] am telling you what I know I have seen
[2:18:55] it it is a good
[2:18:57] feeling when someone is being tormented
[2:18:59] by a
[2:19:00] demon and you cast
[2:19:02] it hallelujah hallelujah I remember
[2:19:05] there was this guy crying with a lot of
[2:19:10] strength and eight girls were caring us
[2:19:14] and when we came they called us we just
[2:19:17] came I said Lord I quoted Mark
[2:19:20] 16 I said he said we shall
[2:19:23] cast in your name because you said this
[2:19:26] sign shall follow them that
[2:19:29] believe all those that believe and so I
[2:19:32] said Lord I lay my hands as soon as I
[2:19:36] laid my hands know the baby stretched
[2:19:39] the girls just
[2:19:41] stretched the demon left
[2:19:45] immediately and I'm telling you we have
[2:19:48] power to cast
[2:19:49] demons if your neighbors call you when
[2:19:52] someone is demon possess Don't Run
[2:19:56] Away don't even say let me first go and
[2:19:59] pray you have the
[2:20:01] authority you have the power you have
[2:20:04] the authority the word gives it to
[2:20:07] you cast out the and let me tell you you
[2:20:11] believe
[2:20:12] yourself if you know who you are that
[2:20:16] demon will go
[2:20:19] and so he was not negotiating with
[2:20:23] him and so he told Michael you
[2:20:27] have out those
[2:20:29] demons Angels
[2:20:33] demons God never created
[2:20:35] demon he created
[2:20:38] angels but then this
[2:20:42] Michael when he came
[2:20:44] down Lucifer Lucifer now had already got
[2:20:48] very many
[2:20:50] angels and he had taken them on his
[2:20:53] side so don't underestimate
[2:20:57] Satan Satan has
[2:21:00] power if if Satan can be able to
[2:21:04] conv angs who are meant to be
[2:21:09] perf how much more on
[2:21:12] Earth we are not meant to be
[2:21:16] perfect bodies that are
[2:21:18] cor so the devil can can do a lot of
[2:21:23] damage if given a
[2:21:26] chance but see friends there was war in
[2:21:30] heaven Michael and his angels F against
[2:21:34] the
[2:21:34] dragon and that Dragon F and his
[2:21:40] Angel it was a fight and he prevailed
[2:21:44] not neither was there Place found
[2:21:46] anymore in
[2:21:49] and the Great Dragon was cast
[2:21:51] out that serpent called the devil and
[2:21:56] Satan which deceiveth the whole
[2:22:00] world he's here on Earth
[2:22:03] today deceiving the whole world the
[2:22:06] world is in
[2:22:08] deception as long as they not following
[2:22:11] this they in
[2:22:13] deception they have been deceived by the
[2:22:16] devil
[2:22:18] if you are not anointed by God you
[2:22:19] anointed by the
[2:22:22] devil there's only two anointings
[2:22:24] in and he was cast out into the Earth
[2:22:28] and his angels were cast out
[2:22:30] in now Satan is the is the devil but
[2:22:35] demons we the Fallen
[2:22:37] Angels so we have demons and the Devil
[2:22:42] Himself so many of of you many times are
[2:22:44] tormented by
[2:22:46] demons
[2:22:48] not the
[2:22:49] devil now the devil is the big
[2:22:53] guy that's sat that Dragon but then he
[2:22:57] has many
[2:22:59] demons Fallen
[2:23:01] Angels you know and and you know when
[2:23:04] when when Angels
[2:23:07] fell God never took away their
[2:23:11] gifts did you know that that God does
[2:23:14] not take away
[2:23:16] gifts
[2:23:18] God is not like a
[2:23:19] man when he gives you something and you
[2:23:23] do something he doesn't
[2:23:24] like he says give it back
[2:23:27] to but God is not that way when God
[2:23:31] gives you he is not ready to take
[2:23:36] back and the devil had gifts that's why
[2:23:40] someone can be
[2:23:42] gifted someone can even preach and go to
[2:23:45] hell someone can sing
[2:23:48] so and yet not a Believer someone can be
[2:23:51] so gifted in many ways but yet still go
[2:23:55] to heaven it's not gifts that take us to
[2:23:59] Heaven it is the
[2:24:02] relationship with Jesus Christ it is
[2:24:05] that Unity it is that love
[2:24:09] connection Devil Went Down onto the
[2:24:13] Earth with all his
[2:24:16] gifts and I heard a loud voice saying in
[2:24:20] heaven now is come
[2:24:22] salvation and strength and the kingdom
[2:24:25] of our God and the power of His Christ
[2:24:29] for the accuse of our
[2:24:31] Brethren is cast
[2:24:33] down which accused them before our God
[2:24:36] day and
[2:24:38] night and they overcame
[2:24:41] him hallelujah hallelujah the accus of
[2:24:45] our brethren is cast
[2:24:48] down amen he accused them before God
[2:24:51] both day and
[2:24:53] night you know the devil is our
[2:24:55] accuser the devil is our accuser but he
[2:24:59] says we overcame
[2:25:00] him by the blood of the L and by the
[2:25:04] word of their testimony and they loved
[2:25:06] not their lives until
[2:25:08] death therefore Rejoice
[2:25:11] ye and that dwell in them to the
[2:25:14] inhabits of the
[2:25:15] Earth of the sea for the Devil is come
[2:25:20] down and he great
[2:25:23] WRA because he knows he has but a short
[2:25:28] time hallelujah
[2:25:32] hallelujah knows that he he knows he
[2:25:35] doesn't have long
[2:25:37] year and that's why we have to
[2:25:39] fight as if it is the last
[2:25:43] moments that's why if we be on fire for
[2:25:45] God
[2:25:47] let us do it as if it is our last day on
[2:25:51] Earth let us serve God with all
[2:25:54] Z let us be on fire friends whatever is
[2:25:58] our weight let cast it down because the
[2:26:02] devil knows he has a short time but the
[2:26:06] church does not
[2:26:08] know the church thinks they have a whole
[2:26:12] lot I tell you we have a short time
[2:26:15] on whatever weing
[2:26:18] do it with
[2:26:19] Precision do it with
[2:26:21] Zeal do it with
[2:26:23] fire must do it with
[2:26:26] consecration with commitment we are not
[2:26:29] living in the
[2:26:31] world like
[2:26:33] wind doesn't know where it came
[2:26:36] from but we know who we are we know
[2:26:39] where we came from and we know where we
[2:26:42] are going we are not falling
[2:26:45] angels we are human
[2:26:48] with soul in us and we know where we
[2:26:51] came from we came from God and we go
[2:26:54] back to God we are here right now to
[2:26:58] raise a
[2:27:00] stand we the bride of Christ is on the
[2:27:05] standard and when that battle
[2:27:07] happened lucier found himself lucif in
[2:27:11] on
[2:27:13] Earth where on Earth do you think he
[2:27:15] went
[2:27:18] The Book of Ezekiel tells us where he
[2:27:20] went he went straight to the Gard
[2:27:25] of and he
[2:27:27] found that Adam was
[2:27:31] away some place in the
[2:27:33] garden and they found
[2:27:36] Eve and began ask speaking to
[2:27:40] Eve and he beg
[2:27:42] [Music]
[2:27:44] her he will come to that short
[2:27:48] Now The God Who is reaching says now if

[2:27:57] had
[2:28:00] it there is only one form of eternal
[2:28:05] life and the reason we always

[2:28:22] God Amen I'm a part of God there

[2:33:28] not theology according to the
[2:33:33] devil go into the Earth the devil was a
[2:33:37] good
[2:33:39] strategist because he was created by God
[2:33:43] let me now
[2:33:44] go when I go there
[2:33:47] okay let me try to first of all
[2:33:49] refuse to
[2:33:51] follow let me refuse to
[2:33:54] follow let me just let me just do
[2:33:56] whatever I'm doing
[2:33:57] here and when he refuses to accept me
[2:34:01] then I'm going to go down to the
[2:34:03] Earth and I'm going to refuse to submit
[2:34:07] myself and when he sends me down to the
[2:34:10] Earth I'm going to show him who I am
[2:34:14] because I'm going to go in his creation
[2:34:18] when I go in his creation I will show
[2:34:20] him I will show him that I can disengage
[2:34:25] everything I will show him that I can
[2:34:28] destroy the
[2:34:29] human but the devil did not know the
[2:34:32] human race a of
[2:34:35] God
[2:34:40] human
[2:34:41] Hallelujah was not like the devil devil
[2:34:46] was created from another
[2:34:48] substance but Man was created from God
[2:34:53] himself and
[2:34:55] theil because I'm Fallen I cannot be
[2:34:59] redeemed oh even man I make him for and
[2:35:03] he can be redeemed the devil made a big
[2:35:06] mistake why because we are human
[2:35:09] beings the human race was
[2:35:14] fashioned out of a
[2:35:20] thisal
[2:35:24] never you have seen the movie
[2:35:27] actor amen doing is it called vampires
[2:35:30] what is
[2:35:32] it what do they call
[2:35:34] them remember zie do they call them
[2:35:39] zombies are they called what are they
[2:35:41] called you know you I saw it very many
[2:35:44] years ago I whe they still
[2:35:47] sh kill
[2:35:49] it and
[2:35:53] then don't behave as if you have never
[2:35:57] watch what is it
[2:36:01] called God bless you you a movie a good
[2:36:04] movie
[2:36:07] Watcher praise
[2:36:10] God you cut off it head and then the
[2:36:13] head
[2:36:14] would let me tell you science science
[2:36:19] and and the world is moving on on the
[2:36:24] devil's you know
[2:36:28] Direction everything
[2:36:31] politics is under the devil's
[2:36:34] Direction but whatever he doing he he is
[2:36:39] coping from
[2:36:41] God he knows the principle but he
[2:36:44] doesn't have the power to make it happen
[2:36:48] right now science has broken into
[2:36:52] God trying their
[2:36:55] best cre human
[2:36:58] being they call them
[2:37:01] robots you know that right these days
[2:37:04] robots can
[2:37:05] walk they even making robot
[2:37:11] prostitutes imagine a man buys it never
[2:37:16] gets to Mar he has a prostitute in his
[2:37:20] house created by a human
[2:37:23] being but let me tell you that's
[2:37:26] wires and and and
[2:37:29] batteries and things like that you know
[2:37:32] what you're made of you made of wires
[2:37:35] and batteries and
[2:37:38] connectors but there is no
[2:37:41] hospital that can create
[2:37:44] recre
[2:37:46] this is made by
[2:37:48] God from the special Bank Health Bank of
[2:37:53] heaven and God
[2:37:56] himself created these bodies and all the
[2:37:59] another system of all the connection and
[2:38:03] how the brain works let me tell you God
[2:38:07] is God and is God by
[2:38:10] himself the devil has been trying to
[2:38:14] recreate
[2:38:16] make it like God did it but he can never
[2:38:20] do it because the devil is
[2:38:22] not the devil cannot
[2:38:25] create and he thought man will fall and
[2:38:30] so he was
[2:38:31] sure and then he came down into the
[2:38:35] garden and he he inserted his
[2:38:39] SE into the human
[2:38:42] race you've heard of evolution haven't
[2:38:49] you've heard of it they said man has
[2:38:52] been first he was
[2:38:56] a and then this
[2:38:59] man
[2:39:02] improved
[2:39:04] improve
[2:39:06] improve
[2:39:07] improve and this
[2:39:09] [Music]
[2:39:12] man
[2:39:14] now if that is correct
[2:39:18] why
[2:39:23] is because this wrong it's not correct
[2:39:28] evolution is not
[2:39:31] correct but the devil brought that idea
[2:39:35] confuse sons of
[2:39:37] men but he himself knows the
[2:39:39] truth he was there in the
[2:39:43] beginning the Bible says the serpent had
[2:39:46] a
[2:39:49] seed and that seed
[2:39:52] mingle with a woman bring forth a child
[2:39:57] with a human race and that's exactly
[2:40:00] what
[2:40:02] happened was not a son of
[2:40:04] Adam you can search the Bible over and
[2:40:07] over and over you never find a
[2:40:11] place that proves Kan is a son of
[2:40:16] if you find it give it to me I will
[2:40:19] repent there is no place but I will show
[2:40:23] you many
[2:40:24] places that prove was a son of the
[2:40:29] serpent was a son of the
[2:40:31] devil not a son of Adam because the
[2:40:35] human race was supposed to
[2:40:39] multiply by Eve the devil came
[2:40:44] and
[2:40:46] the body of Eve and he knew
[2:40:49] Eve before Adam would
[2:40:51] know and by so
[2:40:53] doing
[2:40:56] became with a
[2:40:59] SE
[2:41:03] another how how is
[2:41:05] that well the devil is is an
[2:41:08] angel but he
[2:41:11] incarnated into this P
[2:41:14] creature
[2:41:16] the Bible says it was the
[2:41:21] most and he came
[2:41:23] in it could
[2:41:28] speak and the devil came
[2:41:31] in where does that be
[2:41:33] today God cast
[2:41:36] it became a
[2:41:38] snake so
[2:41:40] today before it was
[2:41:43] not before it was like me
[2:41:48] walking like
[2:41:52] me is it new to
[2:41:56] you don't you know it if you know say
[2:42:00] amen and I can prove that by the
[2:42:03] Bible and that like
[2:42:06] creature
[2:42:08] continued to
[2:42:11] multiply through that seed
[2:42:13] of continu his
[2:42:17] lineage but his lineage was never mixed
[2:42:19] with the lineage of
[2:42:21] Adam the lineage of Adam was
[2:42:26] different through through
[2:42:29] Seth and it continued
[2:42:31] on when you count
[2:42:33] Adam and others up to Enoch the Bible
[2:42:38] then says Enoch was the
[2:42:41] seven is not
[2:42:44] included
[2:42:46] included that's why kan's Works were
[2:42:50] evil that's why he killed his
[2:42:53] brother because his Works
[2:42:56] were but his brothers were right there
[2:42:59] and the Bible says why was his Works
[2:43:02] evil because his father was the
[2:43:05] devil today we have people on Earth
[2:43:10] whose father is the
[2:43:13] devil Jesus himself said it
[2:43:17] and how do we know who your father is
[2:43:20] these people were saying our father is
[2:43:23] Abraham and Jesus said no you are liars
[2:43:27] your father is the devil because your
[2:43:30] works are evil and you do not believe me
[2:43:34] everybody who refuses to believe the
[2:43:36] word of God is not a son of God but sons
[2:43:40] of God Son of God God at every one of
[2:43:44] his word
[2:43:48] Amen in
[2:43:52] the I don't care about my
[2:43:55] opinion that is sons of
[2:43:58] God do I have children of
[2:44:01] God there is serpent seed in the world
[2:44:04] today no matter how much you tell
[2:44:07] them they can never
[2:44:11] AC because there's no
[2:44:13] se in their hearts
[2:44:16] to
[2:44:19] accept by the seed of
[2:44:21] God will always believe
[2:44:23] [Music]
[2:44:25] every
[2:44:27] now we are flesh of his
[2:44:30] flesh we are born of his we are life of
[2:44:35] his God created
[2:44:37] everything then he created man to watch
[2:44:41] over Adam was not just like any other
[2:44:48] was in the image and in the
[2:44:54] likess was a part of
[2:44:57] God he had to have attributes of God in
[2:45:02] him that is why God say it is not good
[2:45:07] for man to dwell
[2:45:13] alone now you say it is a
[2:45:16] says
[2:45:17] not so if you're man and you alone it is
[2:45:20] not
[2:45:23] good tell all the single Brothers it's
[2:45:28] not it is not good don't deceive us the
[2:45:33] Bible says it is not
[2:45:34] good and even for God himself it was not
[2:45:38] good for him to D alone so what did he
[2:45:41] do he
[2:45:43] created amen a man
[2:45:45] that was an extension of
[2:45:48] him life of his life of his and he
[2:45:52] called that
[2:45:54] man and then we see that now when he
[2:45:58] does create
[2:45:59] Adam everything he said is good but with
[2:46:04] Adam it is not good for ad also
[2:46:08] to why because Adam was like
[2:46:11] God was
[2:46:14] lonely needed also
[2:46:17] fellowship and Adam needed to have
[2:46:19] somebody
[2:46:20] else but whatever Adam
[2:46:23] needed don't miss this now whatever
[2:46:26] needed was in
[2:46:30] already hallelujah oh my God whatever
[2:46:33] God
[2:46:34] needed was in him whatever Adam needed
[2:46:38] was in him whatever you need in this
[2:46:40] life is not coming is not coming is in
[2:46:45] you is in you is in me what do you need
[2:46:51] do you need a
[2:47:00] car what do you need you need a house
[2:47:03] the house is in you it is in you yes
[2:47:06] whatever you need is right
[2:47:09] there why because you are like
[2:47:13] God you are small God
[2:47:16] that's what the Bible says if you need a
[2:47:19] wife stop looking
[2:47:21] elsewhere that wife is in
[2:47:24] you God created you with everything you
[2:47:28] need what did God do to make the
[2:47:33] attributes which were in him to be
[2:47:37] manifested God did not do much but I
[2:47:40] will tell you what he did he spoke them
[2:47:43] into existence
[2:47:46] spoke them into existence Let There Be
[2:47:50] man like me let be fish let
[2:47:56] be let be a let there be
[2:48:01] light spoke it
[2:48:05] exist amen God spoke it in the same way
[2:48:11] whatever you need you can spe it into
[2:48:14] existence
[2:48:15] do you believe that you take it you can
[2:48:18] confess it you can believe it God
[2:48:21] believed
[2:48:23] his
[2:48:26] amen praise
[2:48:28] God I'm not going to
[2:48:31] finish but let us go up to
[2:48:34] somewhere

[2:48:39] 2:18 and the Lord God
[2:48:43] said

[2:48:46] good for the man that he should be
[2:48:50] alone I will make him an
[2:48:53] help for him and the

[2:56:58] started but friends that was just the
[2:57:04] beginning when they started a great love
[2:57:07] story then sin came in that was the
[2:57:12] place and I want to
[2:57:14] around here and I'll continue another
[2:57:17] service that was the place that God was
[2:57:23] [Music]
[2:57:25] waiting the devil was
[2:57:29] his God saw him but he left him
[2:57:33] sometimes when you do wrong things and
[2:57:36] God doesn't rebuke you you think I'm
[2:57:39] fine God is just waiting for the right
[2:57:43] moment if you a sinner
[2:57:45] repent before too late listen to this
[2:57:48] moment when it reached there the devil
[2:57:52] had now you know come to
[2:57:54] Eve planted his SE and now Eve was
[2:58:01] corrupt I want you to
[2:58:03] imagine before he could
[2:58:06] touch what do you think heaven was
[2:58:11] like what do you think heaven was like
[2:58:15] In Heaven There are a band of
[2:58:18] angels do you think they were
[2:58:20] quiet they were saying what was going
[2:58:25] on even after
[2:58:27] sin God blessed

[2:58:31] the how much
[2:58:38] more did you know even now there angels
[2:58:42] watching over your life every
[2:58:46] day nothing happens to you but what God
[2:58:50] knows and at that
[2:58:54] moment there's anel

[2:58:59] the
[2:59:02] waters let me go down let me bring a
[2:59:06] storm wipe
[2:59:09] out in
[2:59:12] danger heaven day was full of
[2:59:16] s even in
[2:59:18] danger the garden is
[2:59:21] infiltrated danger danger
[2:59:24] danger nothing takes God by
[2:59:29] Sur think your life is
[2:59:32] in
[2:59:36] nothing God knows
[2:59:39] everything God knows the good things God
[2:59:42] knows the bad things and God is
[2:59:45] interested in every little detail about
[2:59:47] my
[2:59:51] life even what I'm going
[2:59:53] through yes God
[2:59:57] knows God knows and when he saw and he
[3:00:00] had all that news he wasn't
[3:00:03] bothered and Michael came he said you
[3:00:06] remember when you sent me down I kicked
[3:00:09] the devil but here he is he has followed
[3:00:13] your
[3:00:15] he's attacking the
[3:00:19] woman God said ah attacking the
[3:00:22] woman let me
[3:00:24] go and hinder him with a flaming
[3:00:29] sword God said it
[3:00:31] so Hold Your Position
[3:00:34] Michael that's not your
[3:00:37] job there is something I want you to
[3:00:41] say God is
[3:00:44] responsible for a part of
[3:00:48] [Music]

[3:04:44] it is not God that makes a
[3:04:48] decision for the way you treat your
[3:04:53] wife make that
[3:04:57] decision I was going to read a cour
[3:04:59] where says a woman that lives
[3:05:04] unclean a man should put
[3:05:07] away and that was the way Moses
[3:05:12] WR could have Sav now you woman I don't
[3:05:18] want but what did Adam do Adam was a
[3:05:22] real
[3:05:24] man real men defend their wi
[3:05:30] real love their
[3:05:34] real and Adam was a real man he said
[3:05:38] don't you worry you are a b of my B your

[3:05:44] Redeemer but I am your
[3:05:47] Redeemer Adam your husband I am going to
[3:05:51] redeem you out of
[3:05:55] this
[3:05:56] Hallelujah in the
[3:05:58] cham knew what he was
[3:06:04] doing and he went right there and he
[3:06:08] took
[3:06:08] Adam he took
[3:06:11] Eve brought to him
[3:06:15] says don't worry and the Bible says they
[3:06:19] two
[3:06:25] together why
[3:06:28] did
[3:06:31] ration why did he of this
[3:06:34] re that came
[3:06:36] from because he knew the only way of
[3:06:39] Defending his
[3:06:42] wife was if he was a part of
[3:06:47] it he was the Redeemer of the
[3:06:50] woman but had a
[3:06:56] redeemer amen how many get
[3:06:59] it had a
[3:07:02] redeemer had a redeemer and had a
[3:07:06] ration if my redeemer redeems me he
[3:07:10] redeems me and everything that I own
[3:07:14] all my
[3:07:15] possession all my land all my family
[3:07:20] everything must
[3:07:22] be and therefore I'm going to take you
[3:07:26] to andam
[3:07:31] and falling
[3:07:34] on and they walked and walked in shame
[3:07:38] in distress and they went the
[3:07:41] thickets down
[3:07:44] there cover
[3:07:46] themselves
[3:07:48] some and they were there
[3:07:51] crying but listen
[3:07:54] friend all angels in
[3:07:56] heaven we
[3:07:59] shocked what is
[3:08:01] happen to the of Jehovah
[3:08:05] God his family is
[3:08:10] gone
[3:08:12] master one more time let me go

[3:08:19] Already Done
[3:08:21] gabri Master at least give me some good
[3:08:26] news let me take it to
[3:08:28] them tell them that something is
[3:08:34] coming he said don't wor this is
[3:08:37] redemption I will do it
[3:08:40] myself I will do it myself
[3:08:44] God Amen that
[3:08:48] evening he came
[3:08:50] down friends he came
[3:08:53] down and when he came down he did not
[3:08:56] come down to
[3:08:58] investigate he knew what
[3:09:01] happened if God is coming down to your
[3:09:04] life
[3:09:04] now he's not coming to
[3:09:07] investigate he knows everything
[3:09:10] about he knows everything you have been
[3:09:14] he knows and that's why he comes down
[3:09:18] when God comes down he comes down to
[3:09:21] redem and when he came down right
[3:09:25] there Adam had
[3:09:31] the but what did
[3:09:34] God where are
[3:09:38] you read your
[3:09:40] Bible God called the one he was
[3:09:49] respons where are
[3:09:52] you says I'm here I'm here
[3:09:56] fathering
[3:09:58] myself what you naked yes I'm naked who
[3:10:03] told you you naked did you eat of the
[3:10:06] tree that I told
[3:10:08] not says father the woman you came
[3:10:13] and what did God do God did
[3:10:16] the Hallelujah God did the same
[3:10:20] thing that Adam
[3:10:24] had God told Adam don't you
[3:10:28] worry this is the reason why I've
[3:10:31] come God
[3:10:33] quickly quickly
[3:10:35] went and he killed a he brought
[3:10:39] of and he said Adam son
[3:10:44] this hallelujah hallelujah and at that
[3:10:47] moment I believe Adam was
[3:10:49] smiling because he was seeing what was
[3:10:52] coming after that brought another kind
[3:10:56] of by
[3:10:59] default by default he said Adam don't
[3:11:03] you worry here is another one for your
[3:11:06] wife God
[3:11:08] redeemed Adam and his wife Hallelujah
[3:11:13] hallelujah amen why because Adam was
[3:11:16] born of BS of
[3:11:18] godh of God and God was
[3:11:22] responsible that's what happened in the
[3:11:25] garden of aen but let me tell you that
[3:11:28] was only a type and
[3:11:32] Shadow amen the same God came down from
[3:11:37] Glory he came and put on flesh he came
[3:11:41] down from Glory what was that God
[3:11:46] condescending coming down humbling
[3:11:49] himself no wonder when the boys are
[3:11:53] proposing I don't know where that came
[3:11:56] from but they kneel
[3:11:59] down oh I believe is a spiritual thing
[3:12:03] because tying what God did God came down
[3:12:09] from his
[3:12:10] majesty came down from
[3:12:13] and heed
[3:12:14] himself heed himself hallelujah
[3:12:18] hallelujah he said I love you I love you
[3:12:23] I still love you I'm going to marry you
[3:12:26] will you marry me will you Mar will you
[3:12:30] accept that's what he did on the
[3:12:33] cross he humed himself so that we can
[3:12:37] say yes
[3:12:38] Lord and no matter your past life the
[3:12:43] moment he
[3:12:44] chooses the moment he
[3:12:46] chooses love you and you choose to
[3:12:50] accept it doesn't matter
[3:12:53] the all things are God you are one from
[3:12:57] that
[3:12:58] moment and then he begins defending you
[3:13:01] he begins fighting for you oh what a
[3:13:04] love
[3:13:05] [Applause]
[3:13:07] story Hallelujah and I said that is the
[3:13:11] greatest love story
[3:13:15] she came down and he loved me God should
[3:13:19] love
[3:13:23] a I was not
[3:13:25] worthy but he loved
[3:13:28] me if I continue just be so

[3:48:54] Prince's
[3:48:59] testimony but the prince has quite a
[3:49:03] testimony he's a young
[3:49:05] man he's still
[3:49:07] overcoming but I tell you I thought his
[3:49:10] testimony is worth listening
[3:49:14] to he's been he's gone into he's gone
[3:49:18] into serving
[3:49:20] God and the devil has thrown him into
[3:49:22] the
[3:49:23] world and the Lord has taken him
[3:49:27] out and now he's preaching this
[3:49:30] message and we want to hear that
[3:49:33] testimony we will have some kind of talk
[3:49:37] show like we had with pastor and his

[3:50:05] week so you will need to listen to that
[3:50:08] also some sister that has sent me quite
[3:50:11] a few
[3:50:15] questions I think there are some fored
[3:50:17] people and their s for
[3:50:22] singles so I kind of felt inspired to
[3:50:26] uh do some kind of I don't know whether
[3:50:29] to call it a
[3:50:34] show uh but some kind of streaming or
[3:50:38] stream

[3:50:46] by one of those
[3:50:49] questions so that every young person can
[3:50:52] be
[3:50:53] benefited especially on the area of
[3:50:58] courtship I have more than 10 questions
[3:51:00] on
[3:51:03] courtship uh we need to get them
[3:51:06] answered for our young people what we
[3:51:08] believe and how we do
[3:51:13] don't go away from the church and be
[3:51:14] angry with
[3:51:17] shame why didn't you tell
[3:51:20] me some I know we angry with you brother
[3:51:24] Andrew some came to me
[3:51:27] [Music]
[3:51:32] even so I need to tell you why we do
[3:51:35] what we do How We Do
[3:51:38] It
[3:51:41] and that's how we are guiding our young
[3:51:45] people and whoever follows our coun
[3:51:48] things
[3:51:50] [Music]
[3:51:52] go I can tell you I can even count them
[3:51:55] on fing we have
[3:52:02] more prayers we pray they really work
[3:52:04] you know we pray the prayer at the
[3:52:06] closing of the
[3:52:08] year all youer people you made a mistake
[3:52:10] to stand and
[3:52:14] say Will Follow Your
[3:52:17] confession and will make it
[3:52:20] happen so now one man
[3:52:25] down another another man down
[3:52:30] today now another one is coming and
[3:52:33] another one is coming another is
[3:52:36] coming one person told me
[3:52:41] was it you who told me or somebody say
[3:52:42] that when when there is marriages in the
[3:52:48] church say it how did you say
[3:52:54] it when a church has sisters giving
[3:52:59] [Music]
[3:53:00] birth brothers are getting married to
[3:53:03] sisters and sisters are getting
[3:53:05] married and people are getting
[3:53:07] saved that's called a living church and
[3:53:11] I think I agree with him I don't know
[3:53:13] where he got that from but I think that
[3:53:15] I agree with him amen because you see it
[3:53:17] means that God is moving in
[3:53:19] our we want to be a Living Church not a
[3:53:22] dead Church we're talking about souls
[3:53:24] getting
[3:53:25] saved we're talking about people getting
[3:53:27] married we're talking about children
[3:53:29] being
[3:53:30] born we don't believe we're not not
[3:53:34] waiting you
[3:53:35] here so you can go and enjoy life and
[3:53:39] not bring forth
[3:53:40] life we want crying babies
[3:53:47] here praise the Lord because that's a
[3:53:50] blessing from
[3:53:52] God those marriages for those who don't
[3:53:55] fear
[3:53:57] responsibility so lastly I'm also
