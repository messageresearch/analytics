foreign so after the preaching we just have a little prayer and then we can dismiss [Music] so we thank God the brother is already here to sit down Nina so uh I've not known uh personally brother Aaron for long in the government uh uh I don't think I've even ever had interactions with him that much but from the few people that attend this church that have told me no told me that is a good Minister and I had an interaction with him on phone sometime back and from our composition we agreed that whenever he comes around Kampala you should let me know so he the church can also be blessed by his ministry so the devil doesn't usually like like such good things but he can't stop it no I always tell you that the devil can only you know the devil doesn't have the power or authority to disappoint goddess program for your life he doesn't have the power to stop it too late so sometimes you know for example job was destined for greatness and the devil didn't like it when the Devil Went before God he was jealousy what God had given to job and he told him because you are blessed to him but you see God said okay if you think so you can go and touch everything so the whole time it was just delaying the destiny of jobs but it could not hinder it because God told the devil but don't touch his soul and the devil couldn't touch itself so whatever God has purpose for your life whatever you will be you will be rejection whatever we were supposed to receive this evening the devil cannot hinder him Hallelujah man he can't stop it praise the Lord Brother finally I'm told he's arrived here and a few moments will be stepping to the pulpit we pray with him believe that the Lord will use him to be a blessing brother Ben is uh is a it's already public right yeah he's getting married to uh the sister of of sister praise here again amen and uh he's getting married to uh the sister to sister praise they have already engaged they have ready have you conjured oh you call it yeah they

the 28th of October in Virginia Avenue so I don't know whether you have invited us we've not yet received that card we shall be waiting God bless you come on congratulations my brother Ben Jamin amen Mina so uh brother Aaron organ Aaron we waited for you for one hour and a half minutes this better be good [Music] praise God well I believe things that we wait for usually are good foreign [Music] and I know that many who are connected and even later will hear this size [Music] untouched [Music] by you will find it is not too busy to heal [Music] by sing by this moment your needs to stop everybody now we just [Music] lift up your hands you sing me one more time Reach Out foreign [Music] [Music] as in it goes fine let us let us first pray father in the name of Jesus we are reaching out to you we want to attach the hymn of you guys [Music] these are your people father have gathered here and they've not come to hear from a man but they have come because there's a table and there is a switch of food on that tape and there is different supply for different needs and I ask that oh God you will use the minister that's a minister before behind the sacred desk [Music] and Lord may you inspire him he might have a lot to say but we ask that you will only direct him to what you want him to say just what the people need love [Music] spiritual food for this season [Music] at the end of the service we will all be able to say that the Lord spoke to us heart from Heaven Guru Grant I pray in Jesus name [Music] I just told him like he preaches at his home is that a man hey man God bless you so much I want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I mean I'm so glad and happy to be here I mean we I know and I'm sure it is by God is Grace first of all I am sorry for coming late for things that we are out of my country knew I was in time but it became so stressful he just changed the drivers now when he reached inside that driver went out and again another one okay and he showed me that he had he had a problem he got it along the way he left it along the way see so I think they should get another year but you know yeah things are not working out yeah so and we may be seated amen praise be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is glad to be here amen I want thanks God so much for our my beloved brother [Music] tell him for trusting me yet he didn't know me first time to see him anyway that is okay because where could we meet doctors meet in the hospital foreign [Applause] [Music] thank God so much for what God has used him in the ministry it's so much great and amazing but I want to say he has just begun yeah I know I've also just began you know in the Old Testament priests used to begin to serve at 21 to 25 around them their service was a Helping Hands [Music] Saturday we are consecrated and after being consecrated meant that they can now bear the actress that's why Jesus began Ministry after 30. John the Baptist was in the bush for 20 years then came when he was 29 and a half and began baptism I had always wondered what Jesus was doing up to that is a high priest of all eternity he had to follow the orders because he was a perfect picture of the Old Testament I believe brother tell him 50 years they would deserve up to 50. then they would kind of like a retire but not to see it but that burden would be off they would continue and continue like that praise be the name of the Lord amen God revealed that to me recently because I made it started this year and you think actually that you are in your calling when you are just you know God sent us a prophet in this last days and Elijah was to do two things to open the the Seven Seals right and to restore to restore the children back to the Pentecostal fathers back to the Pentecostal experience but you know he was he preached many times until 1947. when actually God says now you are going to begin to do that which God called him foreign don't just be a church member today I always remember understand the syllabus again amen understand the spiritual syllabus where should I reach [Music] and now evaluate yourself and ask God for Grace so he brought that message from 1947. now the second one was fulfilled in 1963. [Music] [Music] and imagine a praise be the name of the Lord amen amen and we pray that may God give give us Grace to find our position in Christ before we have faith praise be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so I'm not much of a vibrant preacher uh not because I don't like it but do not have it analysis special Grace you know when the grace Came Upon the the donkey of uh of baram it spoke oh my name is that was the last time a horse a donkey a mule preached a Prophet by Word of Mouth I mean praise be the name of the Lord so for I won't preach wrong most of the times when I'm preaching I don't use a lot of times praise be the name of the Lord so uh I want us that you we stand up I just want to preach about a simple subject amen the importance of inspiration uh inspiration and anointing looked more like the same company praise be the name of the Lord and I think the word anointing because you know when they would be translating [Music] sometimes they would come across a Greek word that has no direct meaning in English [Music] and then they would create a word because those are the fathers of English [Music] if you have an a Very personalized highly and deep in Uganda language [Music] [Music] did you know that how many know the words I mean so the word anointing and inspiration but I want to talk on the side of inspiration we are going to go to Second Corinthians to [Music] and we want to look at verse 3 the Bible says that for as much you are manifestly declared to be the episode of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but we see the spirit of the Living God not in the tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the hearts and such trust have we through Christ to go to God word note that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God foreign can we just see close our eyes for just a word of prayer Heavenly Father this is the word of God foreign to its perfect meanings that we may receive a perfect revelation we may receive perfect understanding that the man inside of us may be made perfect fully furnished in the knowledge of truth that you are very your very life you be reflected in our hearts and in our lives every day in the name of Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah glory be to God you know Satan is always at work day so foreign the 20 maybe 10 20 minutes I will require it for just a few quotes I just have like two or three quotes so I'm just very happy and excited to be here receive greetings amen they've greeted you in the name of the Lord foreign [Music] [Music] it will come out I mean amen amen praise be the name of the Lord and the rest of you have a second day God bless you come at home I'm happy to meet you this is our first time but there is always been the first time to praise be the name of the Lord so we are going to to share the word I pray that may the Holy Spirit speak to you I pray that you give me your attention and your maximum enthusiasism why because we must preach together you must also have your property there now I read about the history foreign [Music] remember to get scared and be confused noise is a powerful voice it is a powerful thing noise is a powerful on the battlefield Americans and the Allied Forces [Music] they invented the use of noise foreign [Music] foreign it's going to confuse the enemies when the enemy is confused that is a time to get him down there is a time to overcome praise be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so when you are there your noise is important you may not have a gun like me you have a naughty suspense you have an old plastic [Music] you can also make noise when Saturn is here that you see that you are making noise she's so scared because he knows you are believing you are absorbing it you are a man is your first victory thank you I mean don't you let the devil keep you make you keep quiet Satan determinated I believe it I accept it amen Amina oh hallelujah praise be the name of the Lord [Music] not that we are sufficient of ourselves but our sufficiency is God blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Amina we are not sufficient what is that what is inspiration what is anointing is is the power I can say the power I'm a footage it is a motivation to get you from one atmosphere into another attention amen Amina and it from the other atmosphere one second see into a Heavenly atmosis the natural way of things is no longer useful jury you know the issues that you have the first thing you need is to be inspired you must first Be Inspired foreign foreign foreign [Music] I don't have money foreign anointing makes you feel you are zero um but the reason why not is amen anointing gets you from this worldly understanding and it takes you higher Guru oh hallelujah praise that's why men who are inspired many of the natural people thought they were mad because they have gone to another room they have broken through today and with alligators and what did God do to him take away the alligators he didn't take away the the Scorpions [Music] [Applause] and when it was in the spirit he could no longer see the alligators the Scorpions he heard something behind here that he bastard somehow and when he turned to look amen [Music] he's so understanding yeah his hair was white as wood if it is Temptations foreign foreign [Music] come on I didn't see no one bring the money from one to get to another he'll receive three this is the negatively inspired don't you be negative how was the meeting foreign [Music] [Music] don't be full of foreign whatever thing you do he will find a foreign who [Music] is you know that's what it was what that's what we are the Pharisees the disciples eat without washing us yeah you master your disciples [Music] [Music] passes through the foreign laughs have they beaten you have they abused you Valley day they have eaten they are the hands are theirs they have been feeding them if at all they are not washed they will get his stomach to repentance we are full of follows praise be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Amina we should not be found like that amen Amina be anointed be anointed enter in the spirit you know the church should enter in the spirit blessed be the name of the Lord I just want to read a quote here as I'm rushing praise be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I mean the church should be anointed amen Amina brother Brahm says that uh uh the word of God is already inspired amen Amina the Bible says in the book of I think myself they wrote the word as they were I hope Amina Hallelujah just for a few minutes I feel like I have preached [Music] foreign [Music] foreign fight with a congregation and actually we are going to look at that look at this I believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God second Timothy 3 16 to 17. scripture is given by inspiration let me read that scripture so that you get to this point I just go very fast you can interpret after me I mean foreign [Music] foreign the message is already foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] could not be there is a video which I saw and there was like a tutor press here and when they are showing how Moses received them they brought to the fire makers [Music] Ten Commandments foreign when you're reading the message you are already reading an inspired message now let us see here I don't believe in it I don't believe I says every word of it is inspired buddy I don't believe just this is not inspired this is why our people don't understand [Music] is every court is when they read it you must hear that now imagine Brothers his own son um got into courtship yes if it was his word he would have said Shia foreign [Music] foreign [Music] even if an angel why this is Anointed I don't believe just this is not inspired six reasons it is either right or wrong amen and I am willing to sacrifice my life for what is it is either all inspired or none of it is foreign foreign foreign so what Jesus spoke in the flesh yes the same gravity don't don't take don't make others think these are higher than this when you start preaching exactly what Paul says that was poor brother bring Jesus Paul was anointed by who by Jesus yes I mean Paul was was Jesus's microphone amen Amina praise be the name of the Lord where is my let us rush and we finish it one day I will come back for real preaching today I've come to come to greetings these are these are the greetings hey don't say I've preached every day amen praise be the name of the Lord when a man is inspired you're here they give results amen hallelujah you must be is bad on foreign it detects your inspiration also [Music] that will bring the results amen do we believe it is [Applause] preachers you see when that one preaches me things don't come out right let me speak on that thing yes [Music] you know whatever you eat um Hallelujah the problem you don't eat always see ya um foreign Ellie [Music] was not was not a man of Baker born [Music] his days you could bring sacrifices he was a very soft person not because now that he was back asleep but he was a flight a person is sometimes it's going to be so serious and feeling ah it's too seriously he has to have that element is is Satan is not is is not graciously the one driving Saturn out must also be serious people come here when they are possessed from the world you're not even a surgeon you cannot be a weak person somebody gets an accident people they take the person to the hospital he's scared he also says yes get my stitches commit Judah by the time he finishes you will justify the things here just oh there's just some stitches I mean I mean you know what I mean amen Amina so that's how Ellie was being taken away and fire your car the way he cared about his thoughts there is a way a man dies next to the death of Jesus he died and the ass shoe yeah and foreign foreign thank you that is not the death of real men I've been drunk doing it couldn't even distinguish between a man a person under conviction and abundance [Music] and the person that is drunk just like the way people who are kind of government [Music] distinguish somebody who is inspired by the Holy Spirit Eddie they don't understand spiritual things they don't know them why not they know they have never been there themselves but the one was ever reached there knows what happens is when I received the Holy Spirit on the mountains when I was where I was praying I just saw a flash of light coming upon me from that time my senses I I just came back to my senses at three numbers all right what happened to me if you have not been there you have to be there or you know you have to understand what those dreams inspired deep there Monday when you know exactly what to tell those who are there Amina but now because this woman was inspired he told him I am praying I said hey do you know that kind of thing um let your prayer be answered foreign though Eddie was weak he had the area give me a Congregation of angels and I just stand among them um foreign okay you need to be inspired yourself you need to come to church Inspire where Target conditions that will be mine that will be mine I am not ready to go as I said yes my name is it will be enough for you to this God which we are going to finish up Hallelujah feel inspired I feel like a prophesied to speak a word give me somebody inspired pick your

to the Lord Jesus for speaking for us today amen [Applause] that is what we believe we believe that's what we believe we stand for that do we believe that every bit of it we believe that amen you know let me tell you let me tell you let me tell you as uh they're going to bring the offerings back offering bags and we are going to dismiss I want to tell you this we believe this message with all our hearts and we have one agenda the rapture did you hear that we have one agenda the word the Rapture everything else is a bonus the the message must produce a rapture and who is going to benefit out of the rapture you and me we are the ones the messages for us now let me also say this the preacher preached it something that I've also said in one of the services here when the word of God is going on you must learn to receive it personally you know an inspiration oh my if I go in there I'm going to preach another sermon but I tell you what let me tell you myself I don't study I don't go to look in the Bible or into the message to find something to preach to you until I receive inspiration some people were telling us that you see now you know we believe the message is inspired brother Barnum is a prophet to our generation Malachi 4 5 Revelation 27 that is inspired we cannot add we cannot take away amen now some people are telling us we only have to listen to those steps and we cannot preach because the prophet of the age is the only one inspired yes is the only one inspired as the prophet of the age but is not the only one receiving inspiration from the Holy Spirit why because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and and brother Barnum said I preach what Paul Paul preached now brother Barnum did not read repeatedly only the words of Paul he was receiving inspiration from God and taking what Paul preached and then he preaches it to the people so you see that's why every preacher must have inspiration I believe you I don't know you did not tell us how you received this message which You Preach to us today but I believe you received the inspiration to preach it so every preacher must receive inspiration now that's the preacher but not the people also he read for us the qualities here didn't you hear it I'm not going to repeat it again you see you also to receive the word you must receive it by inspiration if you just sit look if the preacher doesn't wait for inspiration and it just comes on the pulpit to preach things that he has read it will be dry void of the spirit foreign and I'm going to bring it to you now if it comes to you and you just listen as if you are listening to a comedian or to a teacher or to some other you know man who is reading for you some newspaper you will receive nothing but if you if you receive it and you receive you receive as inspiration listen listen and you receive it as inspiration from God I don't even think you can you can sit the whole time in the service I'm telling you the truth it is impossible for you to sit in the chair on one position and you don't move away from there it is impossible for me to when the preacher is preaching for me to be in one place I feel like fire why because I'm receiving inspiration like yeah move stand up receive it accept it you know because it is what it is inspiration inspiration go back and listen to that message I believe it was that quote was from the message you hear ye him yes here ye him go go and listen to that message I'm sure you'll be blessed here you hear me 1956 God bless you I don't want to preach another service but today was a wonderful day how many appreciate God for that amen some of you like brother Dixon you have missed you've missed out but you can go and listen to it is that it no no no I I I wanted that one from EA him where he says now when a man is inspired and he reads the inspired word yes yes that must be from here him 1956 yes so please if you want to write down write down and listen to that message but I'm having you have had you know what to do print the message and give it to the people God bless you so much [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
