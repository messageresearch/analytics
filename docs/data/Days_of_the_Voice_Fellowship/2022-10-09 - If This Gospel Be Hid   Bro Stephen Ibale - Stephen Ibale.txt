[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen amen amen amen you may have your seats praise the name of the Lord amen I just want to greet you only the precious name of our Lord Jesus and today we are privileged to have visitors visiting us we are privileged to have the Lord coming our way I mean uh Pastor Stephen as I told you is uh one of the elders with the message in our country you know he will tell us but I think his ministry could span over for about 40 yards [Music] and so there are many other preachers that you know have come up over the years and joined the Throne of those who have started and you know and the message has been preached I always say there are those the first generation preachers of the message the second generation the fat I don't know which generation I am maybe the seventh I don't know but in Uganda Uganda Pastor Steven is in the first generation amen uh he's here with his wife sister Sarah yeah and uh we have had also a marriage of many years they will tell us [Music] my wife and I uh always uh I don't I don't know the right word to use but uh I should say we always convey to have such a marriage that has been time tested and we appreciate you brother Steven and Sister Sarah for being an example to very many in our generation and um so I have had an opportunity to work closely with brother Stephen for a few years he invited me to minister also in his church a few years ago before I even became a pastor yeah before we even traveled to Ethiopia and I was very small body but he trusted me with his pulpits I hope I did not cause any damage but I want to say God bless you for that opportunity and uh so today you know when I invited him to come he was very gracious and he accepted the invitation I want to say that is [Music] um our charge is just well about uh a year and a half can you say your face although we have a few that have come from other churches and so we have a few here who have also been in the message for quite some time and uh I know our students are all not here there are also some would stream with us and since we usually archive our services I believe that there will be many more who will hear the service today we are requesting you Pastor Steven to preach to us there is I believe much more in you [Music] that we here in this Fellowship [Music] is that right and um just have a hundred percent limited you are our father you know it's always a good uh to know you know Apple supports say that you do not have many fathers for those who went and established the message when I I've been I've had that opportunity in Ethiopia when there is completely no message it is very hard to start from nothing and so you should always respect those who start who do the rudimentary work there is always much in them that we can learn I would like you to also give a hundred percent attention we have one service so we want to give him as much time as he needs service we are not in a hurry that am I am I alone on that we are not in a hurry are we giving him as much time as he needs and so then I will know that you are doing that by saying Amen to everyone amen so without uh I would like us to stand and then we sing A Chorus as we invite him foreign was with us in Ethiopia Williams from Ethiopia and uh since I would not like the pastor's time to be taken when he comes I don't know he says no but come and greet us just one minute I traveled with him even to take right where there is a war now and uh and uh he was a good brother I think for one year or two foreign foreign God bless you so much so um we started in our house which is just right here at about three five people my family from there we rented another place out there so it became full you know what Judah the Lord now gave us this place so we want to say uh Pastor Stephen thank you for coming to support us let us stand and sing in moments like this I sing out a song [Music] I sing out a love song to Jesus [Music] I sing God I got a song I sing God of love song to keep or lift up your hands and sing I love you singing God I love you Lord singing eyes [Music] foreign [Music] we give them in times [Music] [Music] so we thank you for such a graceful Lord each time we come into your presence lost in the depth of your grace who tells us every morning and Lord right here we may not be able to tell what's your plan but as long as we are in this divine presence that you are going to guide them you are going to guide the game father that we may touch our minds that we may not understand by our minds father dear Lord God well blessed be your holidays we will pray blessing upon the past the blessing upon his family all the entire ministers amen [Music] you see when he was speaking he spoke about being the seventh uh I mean the seventh generation of Ministries and when he speaks about the Seventh Generation then I remember the words [Music] I feel like because [Music] foreign amen Amina you know I'm very impressed when you're coming down here I find that the preachers uh you know position the preacher's position on the stage is on the left that's what I do at home you see when those angels came there was that main Angel he was standing at a position where your brother Branham was at his right side so you know I feel like nobody should stand between me and the angels praise the Lord I want to stand at his right hand right hand over sorry I always disorganized places because I don't feel comfortable the other side feel very comfortable amen is the brightest side isn't that right yes it's the bright side amen amen amen I mean I've traveled with my wife has you know come a long way with me is 42 years but she forever looks here and the Mystery is simple I think nature so it's just my wife oh yeah my channel amen I mean those hands up leopard for the Saints she has cooked almost for everybody from across the world may the Lord I've also traveled with William William is one of my four Sons William when you get good girls the good boys that's brother Williams is a very great blessing to us amen I mean he's in the medical field [Music] amen so his uh an instructor in the Medical Institution uh amen that is a blessing to our family so before we get on here we want to once again appreciate Brothers for giving us the opportunity when I listen to him when moon is a um there's almost nothing that you people would need more than him and as I stand here I promise I'm not going to say anything other than what he has the ability to say or what he has already said so I'm just coming to share with him in the final year and I pray the Lord blesses us amen [Music] here I says but have renounced the hidden things of dishonest not walking in a craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commanding ourselves to Every Man's conscience in the sight of God is [Music] blessing the reading of this word this verse cause us to renounce the kind of things foreign [Music] [Music] it is heed to them that are lost in whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto themes so when we denounce the hidden fee between there is a light that glows out to the world because your Christ's life is the light to the world so verse 5 here for we preach not ourselves we are not the film of the Gospel We Don't Preach ourselves into your souls we preach not ourselves that Pastor Steve is greater than Brothers [Music] [Music] We Don't Preach ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord when will a Christian yes and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake for God you commanded the light to shine out of Darkness foreign [Music] [Music] but we have this light in action vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us amen did you hear that sometimes you may not know what you have but the light that brought life in the darkness now Paul says that has taken a veil of men that have been Justified amen through you your souls so The Treasure of this slide you do not know who you are but if you know who the words hallelujah amen you can bring life around this world in Genesis step out us the light to the world has taken a fail in you at one time you will adapt this small world you could go tonight [Music] is not speaking about the spoken word books he's not talking about types and bibles four is speaking about not written in pieces Hallelujah Amina praise the Lord not talking about your Bible it's not talking about the fates you listen he's talking about you are you being that gospel if this gospel God give me Grace [Music] each time the gospel is we should always go back Hallelujah [Music] he was no not the creation you are the one who speaks life was the being hey praise God he was not visible Yeti even to the spirit he did not resource capacitor black sisters [Music] because there was nobody seeking to know him I imagine he was self-existence and literally Locust means the spirit logo street again amen I mean are you together with me so in other words he took what will refer to as the world body is because he's condescending is coming from that Spirit invisibility to a spirit visibility and the spirit visibility was what we call the world that is he wanted to reflect himself command he was going to make it yeah he used to live in the same direction with God because he did not have a body of Flesh the spirit of inspiration with the Holy Spirit leads to deliver today yes sir I mean but when it came to town hallelujah amen then God said I'm going to make this man here bring him into dimension of Flesh praise God so now man come down the Angels amen and God was in that stream dimensions he falls foreign [Music] foreign [Music] when he becomes in flesh he became a brother yeah when Paul is speaking about him he's saying that he had become lower from here too arguments so now how can we see the pathways and become like one of us well it's so good man yeah brother Branham says but notes now there is nothing there's nothing okay why did you change there is Justice there is no light okay there is no duck is that there's no nothing just seems of all places he was from Everlasting amen he is [Music] hallelujah hallelujah when we get to paragraph 28. he said the next thing we begin to see eyes of Supernatural looking we see a little white light forming out there that was caught by Viper readers [Music] I was going to say to devop into something so human beings some type of fun idea of what it was the word of God foreign [Music] not to defeat yeah the feet it was not given to the mouse your work is the best gospel you can ever preach he says that was the word of God listen to what it says now God tell him to this song which was before there was even no atom oh yeah yeah glorify me Father foreign foreign was just a different manifestation your move see the sun Oman is the condescending of Elohim omana Elohim yet and when God formed himself we finally got into the womb of the Virgin Islands [Music] praise God Amen I mean let's go to Johnny here [Music] at the beginning what's the word and the Word was with God the same was in the beginning with God now listen all things were made by him foreign so in Colossians 1 16 we shall go through quite a number of scriptures because when I take narrow paths you need to know the prophet two kids too when I was Colossians 1 16. we're all things created in heaven I sensed something wrong there for by him when all things created bye foreign I'm a believer of the King James Bible [Music] oh we all things created whether they be thrown around and foreign the first John all I understand foreign [Music] amen Amina first John chapter one and verse 1. he said that which was from the beginning come on now did you hear that that which was in the beginning meaning in the beginning was the word which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes becomes foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] a perfect okay amen I mean it has to be that place it is [Music] is the expression of his life away praise the Lord I was speaking in one of my meetings out there and I was speaking about the sun you see many times when the sun is mentioned you just go to the understanding of the natural path foreign [Music] he says you're not here father sir says that kind of understanding it up with you but yay in scripture is when the Holy Spirit taking a human face then that is when the Holy Spirit come down on the Jordan River for the first time Jesus yes he was introduced as the son yeah praise the Lord give me John 1 12. let's look at it praise God that's what the sun is Jesus was not son yes because he was born of a woman so in that particular aspect [Music] what would make me a son this way I'm coming foreign [Music] received him foreign [Music] [Music] you sons of God by that locals watching yourself that's what makes you the son you shall receive amen when the Holocaust comes down upon that's what makes us are you here sons of God Amen Amina yes sir we wow so we are not dealing with men we are not dealing with the man he told me we are dealing with the spirit of Life himself don't lose that concept Corinthians praise the Lord is describing the gospel and my speech what is calling the gospel the words we speak while we preached up by the life Aviary gamble meaning so the gospel is more of a work the Walk of the holy spirit is it are you together with me a gospel if this gospel it's a lived life is the discipline of the Christ's life the lights [Music] and once that life is on the inside then the gospel cannot be here and John 1 4. he says in him was life and the life Amina yeah the Christ's life in the Jesus body Christ amen was the light of men and the same life in the bright body in the bright body becomes the light of men too [Music] of the creative life of Genesis [Music] who created the heavens and yes God but it was voided but God created it who called you why you voice foreign but you are the work of God in continuation praise the Lord he created the world going around going around one day foreign I understand your desire to serve God and yet I understand the contradictions that you go [Music] you are in Romans when you want to do good foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] and I took that Hallelujah amen brother Branham says that much of him is God that much of him amen that's the little light that comes in to make you quit doing wrong [Music] now if you can take all the malice at the singer with them again and every German amen that little button like of light and power of God will keep going [Music] it doesn't work particular are you obeying the laws of the church Hallelujah you must by yourself money Hallelujah foreign and as you receive the world your sanctification Hallelujah [Music] and then it produces the supernatural life the life that steps forth with transforming power which made you drunk which took you tonight foreign that will bring from the sea the world will see you hallelujah amen Amina so in Genesis the seeds of Life come through in secretnessify you to manifest the beauty you are not what used to be already never worry about the cartoon that there are some suits that are bringing foreign they are nice fruits but they come from a seat which takes a little longer to come from and you tell God I think here this is uh do you know what empath is you put it in the ground when you get that seed and put it in the ground what's it brother they'll get them resume okay let's go you get that seed you put it there it will even take care it will take a full year but once it's possible Hallelujah I mean you don't need to give up the waiter because certain areas of your life which are not protective just keep under that life Hallelujah amen on the side of a Believer there is a hidden beauty of Holiness [Music] you will begin to ascend into the Heavenly place in Christ Jesus Christ amen I mean you come to a position where are you let them see the lights all the darkness of sins foreign and they just come and stay down to her and the light and once that broadcast Revelation that was the end of it are you together with me now not that she was not in the Lamb's Book of Life but she was not in the channel one day I came up to the channel they didn't know who she was but Jesus knew her yes the rest of the people were saying amen hallelujah hallelujah praise they always talk about Stones this is her wickedness you can foreign Andrew I want you to recognize yourself because the person of the lights by yourself and if he wants to shine to the world he wants to send to the world foreign [Music] foreign in the valley foreign [Music] currency now this is at a higher architecture he's not talking about this book you know the Bible is talking about a man who has eaten these books who was eating the word that's the man who becomes alive [Music] he says now you are a city that is Hallelujah [Music] [Music] what you do not know is that you just don't understand how to position your life what you would be some way of watching us while you're here yes and when this race you cannot be my chapter we shall never be the same the truly Democratic and yet we are all the lights don't strive to become like your brothers [Music] God doesn't deal with duplicates God doesn't deal with photocopies are you together with a pretty thing now everyone of us in the form of Ray of life you are a written a pleasure with several chapters he wants to work in your life amen I mean if the gospel is here it's because what we know is not translating into what we are too many what we are is not what we have believed okay second Corinthians are you here with me sometimes he said at him when I go to my missions their hungry Souls there what are your name is and my wife says you are going to kill yourself I preached three and a half four hours and those people are taking foreign we thank God for his grace if we if we can know who is you'll become a very great money because the light is just a matter of removing the bushels so that's the flame can become brighter [Music] that little button of light it keeps growing up everything else silica [Music] but have renounced the hidden things of this honest not working in the craftiness not handling the word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commanding ourselves [Music] that's your life must be so short it must be surprised that it appeals the conscious of men what is heat away see all your watch I didn't want you so that you can appeal foreign [Music] the attitude changes the Fashion World changes [Music] [Music] there is a level of sincerity it always seems that's the gospel now second Corinthians 4 3. this is not yet if our gospel peace it is huge to them that are lost [Music] but it cannot be it is [Music] are you together Paul has described the power of that life and we have also seen in different areas the power of that is if it is wondering foreign meaning that you the power of influence you are the power of influence are you together with me you leave your life to catch the next election he says if this gospel beat him again has blinded the minds of them which believe not is the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ which is your life laughs the Glorious life is your life amen I mean which is the image it's very important to understand certain statements [Music] and if one cannot see our life is because their minds are blind you are so bright oh yeah that you cause the people to think curated what's in that chat what's in that can say yo you become so bright oh yeah the world Knew You Went Away now you are totally somebody different you are so proud that's the best gospel singer that this church can ever with this light on the inside of ourselves it transforms us and that's what we call the New Paths see where I'm coming from amen I mean you become a new creature is leave this gospel be here and then get it is because we've not thrown off doctor to be sick together with me yeah let's just say more about life you see when we read the light but stomach which thank God we completely diminish it to this life your eyes but you can be in darkness in the midst of this Natural Life I'm talking about her life I'm talking about Elohim Elohim who created himself into light which is called logos came into body of men and then released that same life because the life is in the blood 50 days later and that light came into your body that's where I'm coming from [Music] he came in the upper room hallelujah hallelujah praise God be the body of Christ which was that Supernatural life so you need to know yourself that way too laughs praise God [Music] of Christ at the Crystal that Supernatural life let's go to romance there maybe some pattern mints are you tired if you are we can drop it amen I mean Romans 13 12 years [Music] he's talking about ducks now when it talks about that he's not talking about the absence of Natural Life he's talking about the works that comes in the absence of life hahaha that's why he says the night is let us therefore cast of the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of life he's saying recognize this season recognize the days we are living it is [Music] so we put up Darkness amen meaning that we remove the good cells from the soul amen foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] not in Australia and everything is [Music] do you have the power uh to walk different walking honest you have got a sincere desire foreign [Music] foreign [Music] who took the Lord Jesus Christ which I believe that you have ordered that's where you are here this afternoon amen Amina that's what Paul says when he says if this gospel be healed [Music] she said tell God today I don't want to hurt the gospel I need to put on the launches see this is not what we are doing chapter three verse have been baptized into Christ he's not saying as men of you as have been baptized in the Name of Christ [Music] is because we are part of him in the beginning they are not just realizing everything that I've seen too much I need the remedy foreign foreign they repent then yeah they get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and when they receive the holy ghosts you know it's very important being baptized into Christo which made it so simple foreign [Music] those are the ones that were in him before the foundation amen I mean enter into that channel repent swinging and be baptized of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins of eternal life are you looking at the pathways it means that there is a sincerity and now when the Bible says in the name that the Bible it is not so simplified the magicals they were new like he's talking about the formula that's the right formula according to food is the Lord Jesus Christ Christianity amen praise the Lord no what is the name her name is not just a sound that identifies you differently from another everybody according to the Bible Bible foreign foreign [Applause] amen yes sir that's why we receive the Gospel of the holy church this scripture came my way John 17 6. amen I don't have it here Crystal s amen John 17 6. Jesus is saying yes if the name is [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] because amen [Music] then comes the confession amen I mean when it comes the burial I will not seek one of the last past and finally comes the putting on of Christ being baptized in the name of Jesus I mean to to show it by Baptist then you are putting on a newness yeah a newness of life when we come into the gospel we are not joining Clan are you together we are not joining a club we are not coming to some kind of uh uh you know belief systems I want you to see life [Applause] and that will change their ways Romans therefore we are bothered with him by baptism into death that like a Grace was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should work in the newness of Life yeah there is a
