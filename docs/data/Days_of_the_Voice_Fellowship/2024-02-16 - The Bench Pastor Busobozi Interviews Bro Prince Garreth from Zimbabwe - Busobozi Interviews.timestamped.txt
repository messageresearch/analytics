[4:49] greetings friends uh you're welcome once
[4:52] again to uh to this interview uh this is
[4:55] our second
[4:57] interview and uh uh brother Isaac was
[5:00] asking me what are we going to call this
[5:02] I said well just call it the
[5:04] bench because we seated at the bench uh
[5:08] so uh in this interview we are going to
[5:11] be
[5:12] interviewing and having a conversation
[5:15] with brother Prince Gareth from uh
[5:20] Zimbabwe I met brother Prince uh a few
[5:24] months ago it all started about two
[5:27] years ago when I was in invited by
[5:30] Pastor Joseph and Tha of evening late by
[5:33] tabot to minister here in our national
[5:36] convention uh in
[5:38] SATA and it happened that so happened
[5:41] that I I was preaching two Services
[5:44] there and then uh there was another
[5:48] Pastor a guest preacher Minister from uh
[5:52] from Zimbabwe uh brother side Pastor
[5:54] side and so Pastor side would preach
[5:57] after me or I would I was preaching
[5:59] after him whichever but we're just
[6:02] preaching uh after each other and we
[6:05] enjoyed one another's Ministry and so he
[6:08] did invite me to Zimbabwe and we had a
[6:11] wonderful time there and the Saints uh
[6:14] in guu and so when I went to preach
[6:17] their Easter Easter meetings in guu I by
[6:20] God's grace came in
[6:23] contact uh with this uh brother I think
[6:27] about two people had interpreted for me
[6:29] and then this young man also came to
[6:32] interpret and and after the
[6:35] ministry I was I felt a a big connection
[6:40] with him I I spoke a few words to him
[6:43] there uh but then that connection would
[6:46] lead to his invitation to come in Uganda
[6:50] I believe there is more I did not know a
[6:53] lot or any actually about his testimony
[6:55] and about his life story uh but I kind
[6:58] of felt that he had a calling to to to
[7:00] the ministry and I actually spoke of the
[7:03] same to him directly and little did I
[7:06] know that he was trying in the past to
[7:08] run away and so uh he has since come and
[7:12] been with us here in Cala for about now
[7:16] a month or so he uh came to the youth
[7:19] meetings that we had recently and also
[7:22] has been uh with us here in the local
[7:24] fellowship and you know we've had
[7:25] fellowship with him and and and trying
[7:28] to do as much as we can
[7:30] uh in the work of the ministry uh before
[7:33] I have him greet us I'd like to read
[7:35] Revelation 12 Revelation 12: 11 which
[7:39] says and they overcame him by the blood
[7:42] of the lamb and by the word of their
[7:45] testimony and they loved not their lives
[7:48] unto the
[7:50] death and so it is by the word of Our
[7:52] Testimony that we
[7:54] overcome and so brother Prince you're
[7:58] welcome you're welcome uh to
[8:01] to Uganda many are are seeing you for
[8:04] the first time and we'll actually see
[8:06] you for the first time and uh I know

[8:11] the youth meetings and uh you've sung
[8:13] for us you preached to us my you I'm I'm
[8:17] I'm having a difficulty in finding out
[8:19] whether you are a preacher or whether
[8:21] you are a singer uh but brother Prince
[8:24] why don't you uh greet the people just
[8:26] so that they can hear your voice shalom
[8:28] shalom and God bless you it's a pleasure
[8:31] to be here in Uganda the pearl of Africa
[8:34] It Is by God's grace that we are here
[8:36] I'm so glad to be here with uh my fellow
[8:38] pastor Pastor tala it's a pleasure sir
[8:42] so uh I I I talked about singing and I
[8:45] know in this conver in this conversation
[8:47] we are going to talk a lot about singing
[8:50] so so before we continue people need
[8:53] will need to know and I'm doing this uh
[8:57] because of a reason so if you want to
[9:00] maybe I don't know we don't have
[9:01] musicians here with us today but if you
[9:03] want to do an capella for us for just a
[9:06] minute or so I would just allow you to
[9:09] do that for now that's all right thank
[9:11] you so much Pastor
[9:13] tala so growing up uh my mom used to my
[9:17] mom was the singer in the family and my
[9:20] dad as well but my mom is the one that
[9:21] really sang okay so she would sing a
[9:23] song uh that says remind me dear Lord I
[9:27] love that song because it's speaks a lot
[9:30] is in the things that were happening in
[9:32] my life you get to a point of
[9:34] realization and you realize that I am
[9:35] human but you know the lyrics of the
[9:38] song themselves will Minister something
[9:39] to a person so it
[9:42] says those
[9:44] things that I
[9:46] love I hold dear to my
[9:51] heart they have just
[9:54] borrowed they're not
[9:57] mine at all
[10:01] oh Jesus
[10:03] only let me use them to
[10:08] brighten my life so remind me remind
[10:15] me dear
[10:18] Lord
[10:21] so back the
[10:24] curtain of memories now and then Lord
[10:30] show me where you've brought me from and
[10:34] where I could have been dear Lord
[10:39] remember I'm human Lord as humans we
[10:46] forget so remind me remind me dear
[10:54] Lord thank you so much praise the Lord
[10:57] hallelujah my uh you know I
[11:00] uh I thought I know how to sing but
[11:03] whenever I hear you sing I get
[11:05] challenged I'm like oh God do I know how
[11:07] to sing you know you you've been gifted
[11:10] by God and um we will talk a little more
[11:13] H in in the coming few moments on music
[11:18] and this gift that God gave you and
[11:21] where which places it has landed you to
[11:23] and and we'll get into those things
[11:25] later but for now I'd like us to know
[11:28] and the listeners I'm sure they would
[11:30] want to
[11:31] know
[11:33] uh how did it all start where were you
[11:36] born were you born in the message were
[11:38] you born out of the message and yeah
[11:41] let's start there okay um it all started
[11:46] uh many many years ago once upon a time
[11:49] uh I was born in Zimbabwe guu to be
[11:53] precise I am born and raised in Zimbabwe
[11:56] so I was born in the message my my mom
[11:59] and my dad they met I think in 19 uh 80
[12:02] something there they got married in 1990
[12:05] and I was born a few a few years later
[12:08] in the message you know I'm part of
[12:11] those children they used to sleep under
[12:12] the bench so when you called it the
[12:14] bench it was quite inspirational because
[12:16] that's where exactly it all started
[12:18] under the bench under the bench exactly
[12:20] I was born in the message I was raised
[12:22] in the message and I grew up in the
[12:24] message you know the teachings of the
[12:26] message uh my mom and dad would read to
[12:29] me the supernatural books is uh you know
[12:33] the Bedtime Stories and all those things
[12:35] so I grew up with all the knowledge and
[12:38] all you know the fundamentals of what
[12:40] the message of the hour is but uh you
[12:43] get to realize that it's a different
[12:46] dimension Al together being born in the
[12:48] message and the message being born in
[12:50] you you see it's a whole different story
[12:52] all together you know most of us when we
[12:54] grow up you know you are growing up you
[12:56] are basing on the experience of your
[12:57] parents so me going to to church was
[12:59] because my I had no option you you you
[13:02] you see I had no option but in the few
[13:04] moments that I would get you know where
[13:06] I used to stay there was a Seventh Day
[13:08] Adventist Church I would go there
[13:09] sometimes you know when I'm not at
[13:11] church uh at my home church I would go
[13:14] there and fellowship with them uh
[13:17] Apostolic Faith Mission I would go there
[13:19] you see so I was curious with this whole
[13:22] religious with this whole religion thing
[13:25] it was for me it was um I wanted to know
[13:27] a lot I wanted to get in you know so
[13:30] many circles in these Ministries see
[13:32] things so the message was not born in me
[13:35] for me it was just going to church
[13:36] because I was born there you know if
[13:39] you'd ask me I would tell you because
[13:41] that's where my mom and dad go but I had
[13:44] no experience about you know what the
[13:47] message of the Hour really was uh were
[13:50] you like the only one born of your
[13:51] parents or uh you were like you have
[13:55] other siblings okay I come from a very
[13:58] big family family uh we are six children
[14:01] and I am third oh you're number three I
[14:04] am third and you know what three means
[14:05] Perfection indeed and and and uh you see
[14:10] that uh
[14:12] God was you know people need to
[14:15] understand there something that you said
[14:17] you were born in the message yes sir but
[14:20] the message was not born in you and we
[14:23] have a lot of people especially the
[14:26] Young Generation and of course uh we
[14:30] this these kind of interviews were
[14:32] really making them to benefit the Young
[14:34] Generation because there's quite a lot
[14:37] going on and we need to to to to to help
[14:41] ourselves to understand what it is that
[14:44] we believe what we stand for the
[14:46] principles of our faith and so many
[14:49] young people think that because their
[14:52] parents are believers of the message
[14:54] that they are also
[14:57] Believers and and and because I've
[15:00] actually when I asked there's a young
[15:02] man I asked one time I said uh when did
[15:04] you believe the message he said oh from
[15:07] since when I was in my mother's
[15:09] womb so you know kind of thought that if
[15:15] their mother was a Believer before they
[15:17] were born so they were also a Believer
[15:19] before they were born actually because
[15:21] you know they were their mother was a
[15:23] Believer so they Believer by proxy but
[15:25] we know by the BAM says that God does
[15:26] not have grandchildren that's right he
[15:28] has sons and daughters and so that
[15:31] phrase that you said you were born in
[15:32] the message but the message was not born
[15:34] in
[15:35] you and so um you would come in church
[15:39] and you would say there's something what
[15:41] phrase was that under the bench how did
[15:43] you say that oh yes uh I would sleep
[15:45] under the bench aha during service
[15:48] during service yes and so now you come
[15:51] into teenage so when does this message
[15:54] really begin to mean something to you
[15:57] okay um were you baptized did you make
[16:00] up your mind at at all at some point in
[16:04] life okay yes I was baptized I was
[16:08] baptized I think it was I was 13 years
[16:10] old then when I got baptized into the
[16:13] message into the body of Christ as we
[16:16] like to say by one Spirit we baptized
[16:17] into one body so I was baptized by Water
[16:20] full immersion into the water when I was
[16:22] 13 years old after I had confessed you
[16:25] know the whole process is you know how
[16:27] we we really do it as according to the
[16:30] the directive of the word of God you
[16:32] know you confess your sins then you get
[16:34] baptized so I think I was 13 years old
[16:36] but even then you know it was more of um
[16:42] what can I say more of culture you see
[16:46] when
[16:47] you um you see other people doing
[16:51] something you you you see it's something
[16:53] that has been done for so long until we
[16:55] be we begin to do it as as religion not
[16:59] because it's an experience or you've
[17:00] actually a very you know that deep
[17:03] conviction in your heart it's you doing
[17:06] it because it's you know it's culture
[17:07] it's our culture in the message that you
[17:09] know you've got to confess it's our
[17:10] culture in the message that you've got
[17:12] to you've got to be baptized yes then
[17:14] you get B you get baptized and you try
[17:17] to live the uh a Christian life and you
[17:20] know the word that I said try I'll
[17:22] explain later what I'm exactly trying to
[17:24] say when I say you try to live a
[17:26] Christian Life you try not to steal you
[17:28] try not to lie and all those things so
[17:31] the message of the hour for me uh the
[17:33] journey is I can say personally the
[17:36] journey started for me when I was 13
[17:37] years old you know when I made a
[17:40] decision personally you know I made a
[17:42] decision you know what I want to get
[17:43] baptized you know so yeah that's when it
[17:46] started when I was 13 years old MH so
[17:50] and so you you were baptized we would
[17:52] like to hear the ending of that story so
[17:54] you were then baptized and you now
[17:57] continued in church
[17:59] um where were you really sold out to the
[18:02] Lord Jesus during that time 13 years old
[18:05] in the beginning yes I was very you know
[18:08] I was part of those people they would
[18:10] call Pastor at school uh during break
[18:13] time when others are eating at the
[18:14] primary school elementary school where I
[18:16] went we had this place where where there
[18:18] were benches as well so I would these
[18:21] benches were um had four sides you know
[18:24] one facing the North East the South and
[18:26] the West so in the middle of the it was
[18:28] an empty space there had a tree inside
[18:30] so during break time when people would
[18:32] go for break me I would go to that bench
[18:35] and go inside the bench inside the tree
[18:38] I would kneel there I would pray you
[18:39] know I was very serious I was very
[18:41] zealous about you know about God the
[18:43] head Master would actually call me to
[18:45] pray during assembly at school you know
[18:48] uh this young man comes from a very
[18:49] reputable Church you know they have a
[18:51] very good Doctrine eyes he's a young man
[18:54] it's a choice young man he can he come
[18:55] and give offer a word of prayer during
[18:57] assembly I would do that so I was very
[19:00] serious I was very zealous you know uh
[19:03] back then in in those years early years
[19:05] of the you know of making a decision mhm
[19:09] and so uh you you're 13 years old you're
[19:12] serious at school you're being um you
[19:16] know actually I I used that word on you
[19:19] L I know that someone else had used it
[19:21] on you a choice young man you know they
[19:23] kind of noticed that you are this young
[19:25] man that was zealous and loved the Lord
[19:27] now uh but remember you're born in the
[19:29] message and you've done um you've been
[19:32] baptized religiously and but in your
[19:35] heart you have this desire in you to to
[19:37] love God and to serve him right yes sir
[19:40] and so do you ever then continue on to
[19:44] to serve God after that so after that
[19:47] yes I did continue but then you know
[19:51] primary school elementary school and
[19:54] high school they are two different
[19:56] dimensions Al together M you know you
[19:58] know as you continue to grow the the
[20:01] lock that your parents have on you it
[20:04] gets loose a little bit more a little
[20:06] bit more a little bit more you see when
[20:08] you are now in high school you spend
[20:09] less time with them you are far from
[20:11] them so you get exposed to certain
[20:14] things you get exposed to certain crowds
[20:17] that you were not exposed to before and
[20:19] there the there's these people from
[20:21] different places different areas who
[20:23] have uh who have grown up from you know
[20:26] different uh you know teachings yeah you
[20:30] see you get to meet such people some of
[20:33] them they do not even have a conscience
[20:35] at all some of them they are notorious
[20:37] to begin with some of them you know all
[20:40] those things you get to meet certain
[20:41] people there's actually something that I
[20:43] want to interject here you know the
[20:45] scripture says that um we should raise
[20:47] our children in the way we want them to
[20:49] go we should train them up and that when
[20:52] they grow they will not live that way uh
[20:56] let me ask you a question cuz I've heard
[20:57] of people who say well if somebody is
[21:02] raised in the message they actually
[21:04] raised in a bubble why because they are
[21:07] not exposed to the world and to the way
[21:10] things are done in the world and so when
[21:12] they get there the the devil and the
[21:14] world is waiting on them and they'll
[21:15] just grab them but the question I have
[21:18] for you brother Prince
[21:21] is
[21:22] uh the things that your parents used to
[21:25] teach
[21:25] you and when now you went into this
[21:29] Society let's say into the world now you
[21:32] are exposed you're still in church but
[21:34] you're exposed to the world did it a
[21:36] ring a bell at all were you as much as
[21:39] you being pulled towards the world but
[21:41] did the things that your parents taught
[21:44] to you ring a bell at any time okay I
[21:48] would like to you know answer it in this
[21:50] way you grow up from one year up to 13
[21:54] years there's something that is your
[21:56] parents instill in you you know
[21:58] repetitively every single day you are
[22:01] told my son you see do not do this do
[22:03] not be like this one do not do this do
[22:05] not do this it's something that has been
[22:07] instilled in you for 13 years and that
[22:10] thing cannot just disappear within a
[22:12] year it does not just go you know you
[22:15] choose what you will actually do is you
[22:17] will choose to ignore but the conscience
[22:19] will be there will be there right before
[22:21] you make a decision that voice will come
[22:24] back to you and say but young man is
[22:25] this the way that you were brought up
[22:28] you know better but it's you who
[22:30] actually choose to silence that still
[22:32] Small Voice that speaks to you yeah so
[22:34] you see so in other words the the the
[22:37] things that your parents teach you from
[22:40] 1 to
[22:41] 13 mold you or mold a certain character
[22:44] or a certain conscience in you whereby
[22:47] even when the world pulls you a certain
[22:49] way you just choose to ignore that
[22:50] conscious that character that that that
[22:53] uh you know way about you that has been
[22:57] molded in you but it never goes it never
[23:01] goes and so well then you're exposed to
[23:06] the world and you know you you keep
[23:08] coming to church and then now you you're
[23:09] being pulled by two forces the world and
[23:11] the church tell us about that okay so
[23:15] you know this is like a cycle every time
[23:18] you get to 13 these teenage years they
[23:21] are very tricky you know your body
[23:23] starts to go through changes hormones
[23:26] are all over the place and you know your
[23:28] blood is rushing you get so curious you
[23:31] you you get so active you want to see
[23:33] this you want to do this you want to try
[23:34] this you know and you also want to be
[23:36] cool yeah if there is a if there is a
[23:39] generation that is being troubled by
[23:41] wanting to be cool it's these these
[23:43] teenagers you know you you try so hard
[23:46] to be cool you try to be you know the
[23:48] best dressed you try to be the slickest
[23:50] one of them all you try to be that one
[23:52] who you know who has so many girlfriends
[23:54] who has influence who's charismatic you
[23:57] know in school the most popular the most
[23:59] popular exactly you want to be the bad
[24:00] boy so we used to call it you know this
[24:02] one is bad I'm I'm I'm a bad boy yeah
[24:06] you see you you really want to be like
[24:08] that you want to be assimilated into
[24:09] their society now you see but the thing
[24:12] of it now is these people like in the
[24:16] world they have
[24:18] not they did not grow the way that you
[24:20] did they were not raised up the way that
[24:22] you were raised up so with them there
[24:24] are certain things that they do not even
[24:26] think twice when they want to do but for
[24:28] you you have to second guess every
[24:30] decision
[24:32] orice so at the end of the day you
[24:34] realize that you will never prosper in
[24:36] their area uhhuh you might try to be you
[24:40] try so hard to be like this one you try
[24:41] so hard to speak in slang you try so
[24:44] hard to do certain things but you'll
[24:45] never Prosper the way they do because
[24:47] for them it comes naturally but for you
[24:49] you second guess every time and when you
[24:51] second guess you know when you second
[24:53] guess yourself you never do anything
[24:55] confidently and and actually right here
[24:57] I want to tell the young people that are
[24:59] listening whether or not you were raised
[25:01] in the message if you have a seed of God
[25:04] in you because you see there is this
[25:07] thing that brother banam called a seed
[25:09] Jam a jam of life in you if at all you
[25:12] have that seed of God in you and you go
[25:15] in the world you can never prosper in
[25:18] the world because your Prosperity is in
[25:20] the in the promised land in the in the
[25:22] land of the word in in in in the word of
[25:24] God that's where our prosperity is you
[25:27] cannot Pros in the way they do them they
[25:29] will always outdo you you know if you
[25:31] want to be a thief there is always
[25:33] somebody who will be a better Thief than
[25:35] you if you want to be a fornicator or an
[25:37] adulterer or you know if you want to go
[25:40] in these dance parties and stuff there
[25:42] will always be someone who will do it
[25:44] better than you and you will not
[25:45] actually Prosper like they do prosper
[25:47] and even if it comes to making money and
[25:50] cheating and doing this kind of things
[25:52] you can never outdo them because they
[25:54] know what they doing it is in their
[25:55] blood and something else is in your
[25:57] blood if you want to prosper it is in
[26:00] the promised land this is where our land
[26:02] is is the word of God that's very true
[26:04] and so you you you you so did you become
[26:06] one of those bad boys oh yes I did in in
[26:10] fact you know I I believe personally
[26:12] that you know God gifts people in
[26:16] certain ways there are certain people
[26:18] who are just born to be leaders there
[26:20] are certain people who are just born to
[26:21] be influential people yeah you know
[26:23] you've got people like absolom the son
[26:25] to David he was a very influential young
[26:27] man he turned the whole Kingdom he
[26:29] turned even the uh the chief general of
[26:33] his father against his own father you
[26:35] see now he was just influential like
[26:36] that so you realize that in high school
[26:38] I became very influential in the sense
[26:40] that I would uh I was you know the
[26:43] person would bring an idea yeah you know
[26:46] I would Influence People I would incite
[26:48] people to do certain things you know
[26:51] even though I would excuse myself for
[26:53] example uh during summer we used to wear
[26:55] shorts mhm so me one one day I would
[26:58] just wake up and says you know what guys
[27:00] tomorrow we are going to come all of us
[27:02] we're going to be wearing trousers our
[27:04] winter uniform for no reason you see and
[27:07] everyone else tomorrow comes wearing
[27:08] their winter uniform the people that I
[27:10] played with they come wearing their
[27:11] winter uniform on that day me I won't
[27:13] come to school so when they get in
[27:16] trouble now I'm not
[27:17] there but every other day I'm seen with
[27:20] them to the extent that my head Master
[27:22] asked my parents your young man the
[27:24] people that he plays with but we have
[27:26] never caught him why
[27:28] but the crowd that that he hangs around
[27:30] there were people who used to smoke
[27:32] people who used to beat teachers people
[27:34] who used to escape from the hostels to
[27:35] go and party in these clubs and all
[27:38] these things you see now but I was never
[27:40] caught with them because I was the
[27:43] person who would incite people to do
[27:45] things then later on excuse myself you
[27:48] see now and so while all this was going
[27:50] on I understand that you were also still
[27:52] in church I was and so were you not
[27:55] being convicted at all to to be honest
[27:58] with you you know you get convicted when
[28:00] you get to church mhm and the pastor
[28:03] speaks the very same thing that you were
[28:04] doing that week then you feel so you
[28:06] know in your heart but you you continue
[28:09] to silence that voice because it's a
[28:11] conscience that is always there you
[28:12] continue to silence it until it will
[28:14] come a time when you can easily do
[28:17] anything yeah you see because that
[28:20] conscience you've been suppressing it
[28:21] for a very long time until you know God
[28:24] is a gentleman God will never force
[28:25] himself on you until God will say you
[28:27] know but do what you want to do and
[28:29] that's the problem that we have many
[28:31] people silence the voice of God in them
[28:34] and if only we can be able to yield I
[28:36] always use that word yielding to him you
[28:39] know there's a lot he can achieve
[28:42] through us to the people to the world
[28:44] there's a lot that he wants to achieve
[28:46] through us and
[28:48] so
[28:50] um now you are in high school and and
[28:54] the whole time were you in church the
[28:56] whole time of high school
[28:58] school did you ever get a change of
[29:01] heart especially uh after now leaving
[29:05] these years 13 14 15 16 uh tell us some
[29:09] about your life during that time okay so
[29:12] from then uh fast forward I went to do
[29:16] my a level which is uh fifth and sixth
[29:19] year of my high school yeah so for some
[29:23] time yes I was still going to church but
[29:27] now what had happened I was no longer
[29:29] going to The Message Church okay exactly
[29:33] I had now started going to AFM and I was
[29:37] uh part of the youth there I was
[29:39] actually in the committee the youth
[29:40] Committee in AFM there okay wait a
[29:43] moment now you're taking us fast okay
[29:46] let's hit the breaks a little so what
[29:50] prompted you to leave the message church
[29:52] now to go to the AFM or one of these
[29:56] denominations
[29:58] churches uh well I can say and when did
[30:01] that happen yeah okay I can say that
[30:03] they were friends okay I used to you
[30:05] know hang around friends I was into
[30:07] music my friends liked music okay and
[30:10] the AFM church it was like really really
[30:12] close to where I stayed okay and I was a
[30:14] bit more exposed to you know music
[30:17] playing instruments and you know those
[30:19] denominational boys can really kill it
[30:22] as they say they can they know what
[30:24] they're doing they're so committed m and
[30:27] and when it comes to practice they they
[30:30] practice on a Saturday and you think
[30:31] it's a main service exactly they take it
[30:33] as a job yeah they take it actually they
[30:35] actually get they actually do what we
[30:37] call gigs uh whereby they get hired by
[30:40] certain churches to go and play there so
[30:42] for you to stay at the top of your game
[30:44] you've got to practice you've got to be
[30:46] the best you've got to be the best so
[30:47] these guys were people that I looked up
[30:49] to and say you know what when I grew up
[30:51] I want to play like like this one this
[30:53] one plays the way that I like so the
[30:55] more that you try to imitate them and in
[30:57] the message now their music is not the
[31:00] the way that we play our music yeah so
[31:02] you feel like you are you are
[31:04] constricted like this and you want your
[31:06] freedom you want to learn more you want
[31:07] to explore so I started going with them
[31:10] uh little by little until I was part of
[31:13] them yeah and this part of them sort of
[31:18] when uh the preacher would preach what
[31:21] was your
[31:22] response when the preacher would preach
[31:24] I would also you know in the
[31:25] denominations they speak in tongues you
[31:27] know they are jumping up and down
[31:30] walking up and down they're speaking in
[31:32] tongues and you you look and you're like
[31:34] you know what I want to do this you you
[31:36] try to emulate them you try to there was
[31:38] a point when I would actually go on
[31:40] YouTube listen to tongues of these
[31:42] Mighty Men of God you know these Giants
[31:46] that we call that we used to call train
[31:47] yourself on other speaking Tong that we
[31:49] used to exactly that we used to call you
[31:51] know God's generals ah this one is a
[31:53] Heavenly Commander so and so this one is
[31:55] General this one is Major so and so you
[31:58] know you you listen to their Tong when
[32:00] you get in prayer you are very zealous
[32:02] you know you are very sincere but the
[32:05] prophet says you are sincerely wrong
[32:07] exactly you are so I was so sincere in
[32:09] doing you know all these things but at
[32:11] the same time I was living a double life
[32:13] yeah remember there's the school life
[32:15] there's this outside life then there
[32:17] there's this church life yeah so in
[32:19] church you very zealous in the world
[32:21] you're also what very zealous very
[32:22] zealous in the way that they do their
[32:24] things the way that they dress you know
[32:26] at some point I did not have a
[32:28] girlfriend in high school okay so when I
[32:30] would when we would leave High School
[32:31] like we would walk I think about a
[32:34] kilometer or two from school into town
[32:36] then we separate ways then go to board
[32:39] our you know taxes to go home so I would
[32:42] walk alone with my MP3 player there very
[32:45] small ones and some earphones with my
[32:47] bag everyone is with his own girlfriend
[32:49] you know and I'm walking in front of
[32:51] them or behind them then back home there
[32:53] is a term that they call Chim meaning
[32:55] that you one without a girlfriend or one
[32:57] without hope that they ever going to get
[32:59] a girlfriend you you a church guy you
[33:02] are still scared of this whole dating
[33:04] thing yeah so it really got to me to the
[33:07] extent that you know I I promised them I
[33:08] told them the next time that I'm going
[33:10] to get a girlfriend I'm going to get one
[33:11] that's better than all of you and I did
[33:13] I actually dated a colored girl when I
[33:15] was in high school so there's that life
[33:17] and there's this church life you know
[33:19] and back then we used to go to this uh
[33:22] old people's homes you know share the
[33:25] word uh different places and I've always
[33:29] surrounded myself with these uh people
[33:31] that I thought that they were you know
[33:32] better than me spiritually mhm so I
[33:35] would go with them to the mountains and
[33:37] pray but still you see now in the
[33:39] message of the hour I believe personally
[33:42] that's the only place you can have power
[33:43] actually to overcome sin yeah because
[33:46] out there you can play Church yeah but
[33:49] still living another kind of a life
[33:51] because there is no power for you to
[33:52] overcome that sin that's right you see
[33:53] now so this is something that I I had
[33:56] gotten into I had become part of this
[33:59] world cycle with this world circles and
[34:02] you know people that do certain things
[34:04] and I was influenced into doing certain
[34:06] things so so here now you had become an
[34:08] early mage of Swords you had come
[34:11] from uh Bethlehem and here you are in
[34:15] Moab in the land of Moab you got
[34:18] yourself a girlfriend now and you know
[34:20] you can play music and you know you
[34:23] you're dressing like them you're
[34:24] speaking like them and and you know what
[34:26] pastor
[34:27] uh in this world I believe the message
[34:30] of the hour produce is the best product
[34:33] amen if you go out there from the
[34:35] message of the hour if you go into the
[34:36] denominations they are going to make you
[34:38] a pastor yeah if you go out there they
[34:40] are going to make you a leader because
[34:43] exactly have substance you've got
[34:44] substance so when I was there I would
[34:46] preach they realize you have something
[34:47] they do not have you see now they would
[34:49] give me opportunities to preach I was a
[34:51] very young man know still in high school
[34:53] I would how old were you then uh I think
[34:56] I was now 6 16 years old 16 17 18
[34:59] somewhere there I would preach even in
[35:01] school the school that I went to I was
[35:03] supposed to be made the the head boy of
[35:05] that school until I did something that I
[35:08] you know I was ashamed of and I had to
[35:09] what I had to run away I had to transfer
[35:11] schools and all those things but I would
[35:13] preach even in assemblies and all these
[35:16] things because You' have got substance
[35:18] you know you are of a higher class where
[35:19] you are coming from there's you know you
[35:21] are grounded you know the scriptures you
[35:24] know the Bible and these ones they all
[35:26] know the know theology so when you get
[35:28] in their circles now you know they
[35:30] appreciate they look at you and say this
[35:31] young man you know he's good Revelation
[35:33] this this one this one you know he's a
[35:35] Seer this one he knows you know he's
[35:37] he's deep he's deep General he's a
[35:41] general he's really what he's really
[35:42] deep so you have that you know you have
[35:44] that um that time in my life where I was
[35:48] very serious about this whole thing
[35:50] about you know um preaching about uh
[35:54] testifying in the streets about doing
[35:56] all these things yeah so um fast forward
[36:00] now I was now in you know my lower six
[36:03] and upper six in school I used to learn
[36:06] at this other high school called Mambo
[36:08] there there was a certain brother his
[36:09] name is called shum Muki you know I
[36:13] would preach in scripture Union so on
[36:16] that particular day I was reading like
[36:20] what they do in the denominations they
[36:21] read from the message of the hour and
[36:23] they preach it in their churches but
[36:25] they do not acknowledge way they are
[36:27] getting it from you see now these people
[36:29] they are very slick and very clever so I
[36:32] was reading from the message that the
[36:34] prophet preached at Kadesh ban yeah so
[36:37] that's the message that I went and
[36:38] preached in scripture Union and that
[36:41] certain brother was there in scripture
[36:43] and after I preached he comes to me and
[36:44] says
[36:45] brother I want to ask you where did you
[36:47] get what you were saying because I know
[36:49] it from somewhere I've heard it from
[36:51] somewhere and I was very open to him
[36:53] about it and I told him you know what I
[36:56] actually was even though I was out there
[36:58] in the world I would always acknowledge
[37:00] that you know what God sent a messenger
[37:02] in our day so it's not something that I
[37:04] was ashamed of so I told him you know I
[37:07] was reading this I actually had the
[37:08] spoken word and I gave it to him he like
[37:10] brother which church do you go to I told
[37:11] him I go to AFM and all these things he
[37:13] says h brother I go to the message of
[37:15] the hour you know under Pastor s and all
[37:18] these things so I got so challenged in
[37:19] my heart that this young man you know
[37:21] just comes up to me and just starts
[37:23] talking of you know um the message of
[37:26] the hour
[37:27] and at that moment that's the moment I
[37:30] decided you know what I am done with
[37:31] these denominations I want to go back to
[37:33] where I want to where I came from amen
[37:36] so in other words uh that young man
[37:40] reminds you of who you are exactly he
[37:43] helps you to come to yourself at that
[37:45] moment and uh so it doesn't really
[37:49] matter whether you're preaching or
[37:51] not uh but the life that you live can
[37:54] really help restore somebody am maybe
[37:56] someone is backsliding or someone has
[37:59] you know lost hope but the life that you
[38:01] live will be a sermon to somebody but
[38:04] the BAM said that uh instead of
[38:06] preaching me as someone leave me one you
[38:08] know um and so that young man Leed you
[38:10] as someone and uh it was enough to uh
[38:14] minister to your heart and say well I
[38:16] need to go back home and so you go back
[38:19] to the church yes so that was now in
[38:22] 2015 2015 M so I I went back in you know
[38:26] to church and and all the things I was
[38:29] now very serious you know I would come
[38:31] from school I would go home at home we
[38:33] have this chick chicken pan that we have
[38:35] behind you know I got so challenged I
[38:38] would go in the in the chicken pan it
[38:40] was empty so I would get in there I
[38:42] would pray for 4 hours straight wow you
[38:44] know going and I'm praying I'm so you
[38:46] know hungry you know to get to know more
[38:49] to get to see the move of God in my life
[38:51] you know I'm in these circles I was in
[38:53] these Circles of these you know prophets
[38:54] and all these things now I know oh I'm
[38:57] backing the message and I know that
[38:58] there's something that is why is it in
[39:01] the denominations when they preach
[39:03] demons they fall and manifest but in the
[39:05] message of the hour have not seen that
[39:08] why is it that but yet we claim to have
[39:10] you know that very thing that is yeah
[39:12] the power we claim to so I was so hungry
[39:15] to you know for God to be seen in my
[39:17] life so I would pray I would do all the
[39:19] I would fast and do all the things
[39:20] preach in school testify in the streets
[39:23] but you know the devil is slick and he's
[39:24] clever yeah you see oh this time this
[39:27] was me trying fast forward to 2017 I was
[39:30] in the message of the hour I was an
[39:32] interpreter in
[39:33] church then I went to University yes now
[39:38] this is a different devil Al together is
[39:40] different from the one in in high school
[39:42] different from the one in primary school
[39:44] you know now you are free I wasn't you
[39:46] would go to school even if you would
[39:48] come back home at around 12:00 p.m.
[39:50] 12:00 a.m. in the morning you still tell
[39:52] your parents I know what I was I was in
[39:54] a discussion even if you weren't they
[39:56] don't don't have any way to prove it
[39:57] yeah you are free as a bird you can do
[39:59] literally anything yeah you see now so I
[40:02] started you know uh fully I was doing
[40:06] music now uh how did you choose how did
[40:08] you choose your course uh I have always
[40:11] had a passion for music there's a
[40:13] certain brother at church his name is
[40:14] brother Silas magaga okay he used to
[40:17] play the bass I loved how he play the
[40:19] bass I would sitting that's the only
[40:21] instrument that I could hear so I asked
[40:23] him how he told me I know I'm doing
[40:25] music in school and all this so I grew
[40:27] up with the mentality that I want to go
[40:28] and do music in school so when the
[40:31] opportunity came I had two choices it's
[40:33] either to go and do psychology or to go
[40:36] and do music and I said you know what
[40:38] psychology I can always do it but let me
[40:39] chase after my what my passion so I went
[40:41] into University and started doing music
[40:44] now music is a very tricky Avenue now
[40:49] that's where we are now reaching at uh
[40:51] the place that we have longer waited for
[40:53] because uh part of the reason why I
[40:56] really wanted to have this testimony go
[40:58] out is we have a lot of young people
[41:02] that are getting into this
[41:04] trap the the Trap Of Music Now music is
[41:08] of God and uh we know that Lucifer was a
[41:12] music leader in heaven and so if God had
[41:16] a music leader God must have loved music
[41:18] that's very true and so I know that uh
[41:21] we we we we worship God through music
[41:24] and that music brings the atmosphere the
[41:25] right at osphere David you know danced
[41:28] and we believe in music we believe in
[41:29] dancing we believe in using all musical
[41:32] instruments and we believe in training
[41:34] them as well training to to to to use
[41:36] them as well uh but when I listened to
[41:39] your testimony I I was really impacted
[41:43] and I felt that there are many others
[41:45] that would want to hear and especially
[41:48] there might be some who are struggling
[41:50] in this area and doing things the wrong
[41:53] way so tell us about uh
[41:56] your University and the music thing and
[42:01] you are now back in church you even
[42:03] interpreting you are now becoming a
[42:05] prayer Warrior and and then now you go
[42:07] back to University so it looks like
[42:09] you've gotten back on your feet now uh
[42:11] you're getting older now you know you're
[42:14] leaving childish things behind you and
[42:16] and now you're going into college and
[42:18] and now you
[42:19] choose um I do not know even how you
[42:22] arrived at that choice of choosing to do
[42:25] that course yes you told me that there's
[42:26] a brother who was inspiring you and he
[42:27] said he was in doing the music school
[42:30] did you ever seek your pastor's councel
[42:32] on that whether or not you should do
[42:34] that I did I actually went to the pastor
[42:37] and the Pastor said you know what music
[42:38] is a very good thing you know besides
[42:40] after you do music you can train also
[42:42] our young people now here in the church
[42:44] you can groom them you know so before
[42:48] you go there and do music um you are
[42:51] innocent yeah you do not know what it
[42:54] entails yeah you know you have very
[42:56] innocent so I you know I was so excited
[42:58] the Pastor said you know what you can
[42:59] actually go and do music it's a it's a
[43:01] good program you know so I went and did
[43:04] music so when I go there now um I grew
[43:08] up in the church when you grow up in
[43:10] church you learn instruments you learn
[43:13] to do things so when I go to school I
[43:16] was already a musician I I was already
[43:18] playing the Basse I was already playing
[43:20] the keyboard I was already a singer yeah
[43:23] so I get there in my class I'm I'm up
[43:28] there and others they're following you
[43:29] see now so of you know there there's
[43:33] this policy that they had when you are
[43:36] level one it's very hard for you to get
[43:38] into the band but me I was the first
[43:41] person to be inducted into the band M as
[43:44] a second basist and vocalist right from
[43:46] L right from the GetGo you see now so
[43:50] when you get into the band they don't
[43:51] play church music by the way remember
[43:53] they play worldly music now they really
[43:56] played in on a professional scale give
[43:58] me some of these songs the examples of
[44:00] them some of the songs that you used to
[44:02] play um the songs by John Legend they
[44:05] used to play the songs by the legendary
[44:07] James Brown they used to play songs by
[44:10] uh satm they would play our local music
[44:14] Thomas mumo oliv this traditional music
[44:18] you know the ones that incite mediums
[44:20] you know that kind of music that's the
[44:23] music that they would play so you are
[44:25] getting into such circles remember now
[44:27] music is very tricky because music has
[44:29] got an influence behind yeah music has
[44:31] got a spirit and inspiration that is
[44:33] behind it so when you partake in it
[44:36] there is this spirit that comes over you
[44:38] I would always wonder why is it you know
[44:39] there's this instrument that we call
[44:42] back home that these people who uh you
[44:45] know communicate with the dead play
[44:48] every time they play it their heads are
[44:49] going I used to ask myself why is it
[44:51] every time they are playing this
[44:52] instrument they all of them three qus of
[44:55] them they've got dreadlocks yeah I used
[44:57] to ask myself why but then you would
[45:00] realize it's an atmosphere that when you
[45:02] start playing you get into that
[45:04] atmosphere literally you get besides
[45:06] your body and get into that atmosphere
[45:09] it's like you put on a certain character
[45:11] you put on a certain even the way that
[45:13] you dress changes by the way mhm you you
[45:15] you start to wear these shambas you
[45:17] start to wear these necklaces with the
[45:20] African map you start wearing oh this
[45:22] funny funny Colors oh there funny hats
[45:24] there funny shoes funny trousers you
[45:26] know funny things because you are it's
[45:29] an image it's not only sound it comes as
[45:32] well as an image it's not only an image
[45:35] it comes as well as a spirit and as an
[45:38] as an inspiration so you start to do
[45:40] things that are very weird and very very
[45:42] strange you see I would go into clubs I
[45:45] was now getting into clubs playing in
[45:47] the name of school in the name of school
[45:49] yeah you see in the name of school I'm
[45:51] playing in clubs the band is a session
[45:53] somewhere the a certain politician is
[45:54] coming I go there there I sing a song
[45:57] everyone claps your hands and you know
[45:58] when people clap your hands you start to
[45:59] feel this this certain thing becoming
[46:01] something after that girls and music ah
[46:05] these ones they Inseparable girls would
[46:07] come with without you even asking for
[46:09] their phone number they would give you
[46:10] their phone number you know I like your
[46:11] voice hey you are so sweet I like the
[46:13] way that you dress you know you've got
[46:15] the style you smell so good this and
[46:17] that they give you all these compliments
[46:19] remember this is not something that you
[46:21] are used to and now the the level of
[46:23] these girls now is different from those
[46:25] ones that High School in high school
[46:27] they are wearing uniforms now in
[46:28] University they dress different M they
[46:31] look different so it's something that is
[46:34] you know it's a sight to be old you're
[46:35] like hey this one she's light skinned
[46:37] she came and gave me a number without me
[46:38] even asking Slowly by slowly you're what
[46:41] you're drifting more and more you're
[46:43] going to BU these women they come
[46:46] elderly women and by this time were you
[46:49] still attending church I was now but
[46:53] remember I was now getting hired to play
[46:56] music in different churches so it
[46:58] started as a Wednesday gig okay and
[47:02] Wednesdays we used to have service tell
[47:03] us about these gigs because as I Know It
[47:08] uh there are many musicians message
[47:11] musicians that do these gigs especially
[47:15] here in Africa where there are not many
[47:19] opportunities for jobs and income
[47:21] generating uh opportunities especially
[47:24] for young people who are not yet up
[47:27] there in in life you're not fully
[47:29] educated yet but gifted musicians and so
[47:33] they they do gigs so tell me about this
[47:36] life of gigs all right now the life of
[47:39] gigs is very
[47:40] enticing remember you are doing what you
[47:42] love that's the first thing
[47:45] yeah and you are getting paid for it
[47:48] yeah so it's like killing two birds with
[47:50] one stone yeah H you doing what you love
[47:53] already and you are getting paid to do
[47:55] what you love I don't know which camera
[47:56] you're looking to I want you to to look
[47:58] at that those young people straight to
[47:59] their eyes and and and tell them tell
[48:02] them all right over here all right so my
[48:06] fellow brothers and sisters music is a
[48:09] very it's a rabbit hole it's very
[48:11] enticing especially these gigs you are
[48:14] doing what you love and you are getting
[48:16] paid for it you know and they pay you
[48:18] handsomely especially not when you're
[48:20] playing in churches especially when you
[48:22] play in the world there the people from
[48:24] the world they not sting with money like
[48:26] the people in the church people in the
[48:27] church they will give you $10 for
[48:29] playing the whole service which is 4
[48:31] hours but in the world therefore for
[48:33] playing for 30 minutes they'll give you
[48:36] $50 so you compare now in the church I'm
[48:39] being paid $10 to play for 4 hours in
[48:42] the world I'm being given $50 to play 30
[48:44] minutes where would you rather go and
[48:46] play in the world wow in the world
[48:48] exactly getting more money so it started
[48:50] as just playing in church Wednesday we
[48:52] used to have church in my home in my
[48:54] home church we used to have services on
[48:56] on wedes on Wednesday and I had a gig on
[48:59] Wednesday so that means on Wednesday I'm
[49:01] no longer coming to what no long coming
[49:03] to church in my mind we are still
[49:05] serving God but now I'm being paid to
[49:08] serve God I can now buy a very nice
[49:10] trousers I can now buy a time I can now
[49:13] do this I can now do this you know I'm
[49:15] enabling myself so as I thought so it
[49:19] started with abs scoring Wednesday
[49:20] service from Wednesday became Wednesday
[49:23] service and Friday all night from then
[49:25] it would become even on Sunday on Sunday
[49:27] in church there's more money because
[49:29] it's the main service they would pay you
[49:31] more money than on Wednesday or on
[49:32] Friday so now I stopped coming to church
[49:35] entirely I became a visitor in church
[49:37] when my conscience would tell me man you
[49:39] haven't gone to church for a very long
[49:41] time I just go on a Wednesday after
[49:43] school just you know just to get my
[49:46] names so that they say you know what was
[49:48] your sitting position in church then
[49:50] when you would go right now when I would
[49:52] go in church I wasn't doing anything in
[49:53] church I would just go and sit in church
[49:55] Church sit in the back yeah just to
[49:57] quieten my conscience yeah you see I
[50:00] love the way you say down in Zim in the
[50:02] back MH yeah you sit in the back yeah
[50:04] you say in the back we say the
[50:07] back exactly so you see I usually say if
[50:11] a young person you are young you
[50:14] energetic you're strong and you are
[50:16] sitting in the back of the church why
[50:19] there is there's a problem somewhere
[50:20] that's very true sincerely if you see
[50:22] people sitting sitting in the back of
[50:24] the church true when they are seats in
[50:26] the front there's a problem with them to
[50:28] begin with there's something that
[50:30] they're trying to avoiding the fire the
[50:33] place where they can be changed and a
[50:35] place where they can meet God and a
[50:36] place where they can you know Express
[50:39] themselves to God what are you what are
[50:40] you running away from yeah that's you
[50:42] know so I noticed even before you told
[50:45] me you must have been sitting in the
[50:47] back yes I was I was I would sit in the
[50:50] back and you know once in a while I
[50:53] would call the pastor ah Shalom D how
[50:55] are you I'm I'm doing well know that's
[50:56] wonderful how was my mind how was you
[50:58] know my my siblings I know they all
[51:00] right I know that's wonderful you and
[51:02] you know when you talk to the pastor and
[51:03] the pastor responds positively you feel
[51:05] like yeah God God is still with me
[51:07] everything is well you know one thing
[51:09] that I've noticed about my pastor is
[51:12] he's he's not someone who's indifferent
[51:14] yeah he's not a bitter person yeah you
[51:16] know he's very humble Pastor s is very
[51:19] humble you know when he never makes you
[51:22] feel like you are the worst sinner yeah
[51:26] he will make you feel that there is hope
[51:28] yeah yes you are backsliding but there
[51:30] is hope even the way that you talk to
[51:32] you are my son you know ah we miss you
[51:34] and all these things so when he's
[51:36] talking to you like that and you are
[51:38] like you know what after all I'm the
[51:40] pastor is still you know saying calling
[51:42] me son I'm I'm still good yeah you see
[51:45] and you see this is not only your pastor
[51:48] it's the attitude of the father is the
[51:50] attitude of God exactly I don't believe
[51:52] that this message has come to ridicule
[51:56] us or pull us out and judge and condemn
[52:00] us and and show us a very tough God who
[52:03] is just about to to kill and you know do
[52:06] something bad to us or judge us and you
[52:08] know take us out of of uh of his grace
[52:12] and I believe that this is a message of
[52:14] Grace amen and um and even pastors it
[52:18] really comes to also show that we have
[52:20] to to show Grace to these young people
[52:23] because many of them are running away
[52:24] from church because they are heartbroken
[52:28] maybe they don't feel they received in
[52:30] church or maybe because they they feel
[52:32] sinful or maybe because they feel they
[52:34] they rejected you know in the message
[52:38] circles we have this kind of righteous
[52:40] indignation about us you know someone
[52:43] come addressed in a way that is not
[52:45] usual or speaking or or you know that so
[52:48] and so might have backx done something
[52:50] bad immediately you become indifferent
[52:52] and then you know you show them attitude
[52:54] and you know
[52:56] and these things push them even harder
[52:58] and even harder into the world and so it
[53:01] really comes to show that not only the
[53:03] pastors but even the people the L the
[53:05] people themselves we should be more
[53:07] receiving we should be more gracious to
[53:09] the people because these maybe young
[53:11] people are struggling and they need God
[53:14] they need to find a reason to come back
[53:17] home that's right and that reason will
[53:19] always be love because love will always
[53:21] conquer amen that's and that's why the
[53:24] father re received the son the prodal
[53:26] son received him back he didn't say oh
[53:28] no go back he said I I will receive you
[53:31] not not as a servant I'll receive you as
[53:34] my son because your blood my blood is
[53:38] still flowing through your veins and so
[53:41] the pastor Pastor side and I really
[53:42] appreciate him is um like you said a
[53:45] humble man of God I've been in his house
[53:47] hosted there a few um several days
[53:51] actually and I noticed that he and his
[53:53] wife and family they very Gra very kind
[53:56] people and they really love the Lord and
[53:58] this message with all their heart and so
[54:00] he he would you know each time talk to
[54:03] you and he was very gracious to you he
[54:05] was yeah so he was very gracious to me
[54:09] and you know he would talk to you and
[54:11] you would feel like you know what even
[54:12] if I would go back I still have a place
[54:15] to go back to MH you see now that's his
[54:17] attitude yeah that's how he does his
[54:20] things you see now so uh after that I
[54:24] was doing all this gigs and everything
[54:26] so I remember once I almost got killed I
[54:29] almost died mhm so I became very popular
[54:32] in this secular music okay you know I
[54:35] hadn't released my own songs but I would
[54:37] do cover songs I would sing certain
[54:39] people's songs on weddings I would sing
[54:41] certain people's songs in clubs and all
[54:42] these things I was now getting into
[54:44] clubs and once you get into clubs now
[54:46] you start drinking okay it's that's the
[54:49] atmosphere of clubs you start drinking
[54:51] you pick up smoking so I picked up
[54:53] drinking I picked up smoking I picked up
[54:55] women what exactly were you smoking I
[54:57] was smoking marijuana we call it
[55:00] weed we call it weed because bang
[55:04] exactly because you know they say that
[55:06] weed is different from cigarettes
[55:08] cigarettes they can kill you because
[55:10] they' have got so much nicotine but the
[55:13] the herb as they say it's natural it's
[55:16] now you're taking something natural so
[55:17] you are convincing yourself no this is
[55:19] very natural you know there are no side
[55:21] effects to this yeah so I picked up
[55:24] drinking I picked up smoking I picked up
[55:26] women there was a certain time when I
[55:29] what kind of women oh um just women
[55:32] little girls middle aged older women all
[55:35] kinds of women my goodness all kinds of
[55:37] women I remember um there was a point
[55:40] when I would I would have I'm not proud
[55:43] to say this but I am you know what this
[55:45] is my testimony and I know that probably
[55:47] there's someone who's going through the
[55:48] same thing I would date women my age
[55:52] under my age even way older than me MH
[55:55] you see so I would have a girlfriend for
[55:58] every week my God I would have a
[55:59] girlfriend this week next week I'm bored
[56:01] with this one because I was exposed to a
[56:04] lot of them and I could pick any
[56:06] remember I'm a musician you know they
[56:08] like you know this guy and all these
[56:10] things he's got curly hair he's got a
[56:13] nice voice you know his skin color and
[56:16] all these things so I would I had a wide
[56:19] range to choose from outside this one
[56:21] this week this one next week until it
[56:23] got to an extent I remember at one point
[56:25] I played the base at a certain church
[56:27] and I was training their vocals and
[56:29] there I met Another Woman She's an Old
[56:32] Woman married woman by the way she tells
[56:34] me you know what I like your voice I
[56:35] want you to teach my children how to
[56:36] sing that's how it started MH gave me a
[56:39] phone number and all these things we
[56:40] went to this other Camp there I did not
[56:43] bring my blankets she gave me a blanket
[56:44] of her own she calls me weeks later you
[56:47] know what I'm just laying in my bed and
[56:49] I realize you my blanket smells like you
[56:52] this is how the conversation started my
[56:53] blanket smells like you she gets you
[56:55] know she started getting free with me
[56:57] she started even to call me around 2:00
[56:59] a.m. in the morning I'm bored let's talk
[57:01] and all these things so from calling me
[57:03] with my name she started calling me babe
[57:06] babe this babe that babe this babe that
[57:08] she was a business woman I wanted to get
[57:10] into business so personally so you felt
[57:13] like this was an opportunity way exactly
[57:16] this is an opportunity for me you know
[57:18] and before I know before there was no
[57:20] evil in your mind like you know living
[57:22] immoral with this woman or something
[57:24] like that there was nothing at all
[57:25] because I I was gone and now I was
[57:29] really gone I would drink every Friday I
[57:32] would get drunk church sometimes I
[57:34] wouldn't even go I would do a lot of
[57:36] things Pastor I would do a lot of things
[57:39] so I started dating this woman this
[57:42] other time I remember she says you know
[57:43] what I'm going to to I want to introduce
[57:45] you to a few people in AR business mul
[57:48] there you know what and and everything
[57:50] so I went with her to arari and when we
[57:52] got there she hired a presidential Lord
[57:56] you see she's someone who drove these
[57:58] very fancy cars so it was her and her
[58:01] friend and then me we went there hir had
[58:04] a very booked a very made a reservation
[58:07] at a very fancy fancy uh presidential
[58:10] Lodge in Mount Pleasant there and all
[58:12] these things we went there and you know
[58:15] this other time she tolds she tells me
[58:18] you know what uh I want to go I want you
[58:20] to accompany me to the lodge MH I want
[58:22] to go and take a shower this is a
[58:24] married woman remember M she's telling
[58:26] me accompany me to the lodge to take a
[58:28] shower huh you know where this thing is
[58:31] going already but I don't know God had
[58:34] just a way of you know keeping me away
[58:36] from it they got into an argument about
[58:38] me going with her so apparently the
[58:40] friend now got interested in me of this
[58:43] married woman she got interested in me
[58:45] so now they are fighting this friend is
[58:47] not married telling the married woman
[58:49] you are
[58:49] married and you want this young man for
[58:52] yourself you are married for crying out
[58:53] loud you see
[58:55] let me have him one one one little demon
[58:58] fighting against another for you another
[59:01] for you exactly so personally when I
[59:04] look at it now you remember uh
[59:07] Jehoshaphat when he was you know all
[59:10] these Kings they come to fight them and
[59:13] God Made Them Fight one another yeah so
[59:15] personally I believe that specifically
[59:16] for that night God Made Them Fight one
[59:19] another for my sake because if I had
[59:21] gone my God this is a married woman
[59:25] and it was going to go very bad H and
[59:29] and I just I when you said that I just
[59:32] felt the presence of God and I want to
[59:34] speak to maybe somebody who is listening
[59:37] I'm so convinced in my heart friends
[59:39] that this is not just a testimony by the
[59:42] prince but is reaching out to somebody
[59:45] that needed it at this moment and I just
[59:49] fa to say to you that the your enemies
[59:53] will fight against one one
[59:56] another God will fight for you and
[59:58] that's how he fights for you if only you
[1:00:01] can if only you are listening to this
[1:00:04] that's all it takes it just takes a
[1:00:06] moment you know and um the Lord will
[1:00:10] make it happen for you if you can just
[1:00:12] believe and and brother please go ahead
[1:00:15] with that testimony so they
[1:00:18] fought and they had these keys to the
[1:00:21] BMW you know those fancy cars so while
[1:00:24] it's fighting one through the key and
[1:00:27] smashed against the wall I don't know
[1:00:28] what happened to the cords in there when
[1:00:30] we went to the car tried to start the
[1:00:32] car the car would not start the car
[1:00:33] would not go anywhere so in we didn't go
[1:00:36] anywhere at the end of the day a few
[1:00:39] days later or a few weeks later I
[1:00:41] received a call on my phone God from the
[1:00:44] husband now wait a moment I still can't
[1:00:47] get this around my head God put up a
[1:00:51] fight between these two women in order
[1:00:54] to protect you
[1:00:57] amen well someone may say well what
[1:01:00] about all these other women and the
[1:01:02] smoking and the things well yes all that
[1:01:05] happened and was actually happening and
[1:01:07] this was not a thing for you because uh
[1:01:11] it's not the only thing that you had
[1:01:12] that you would have had you would have
[1:01:14] had you would have done but God stopped
[1:01:18] you from going this farh because he was
[1:01:22] protecting you from some something you
[1:01:25] actually did not know what you were
[1:01:27] getting yourself into that's very true
[1:01:29] that's very true so what happened after
[1:01:31] that the husband calls me on my phone
[1:01:34] the same day no weeks later after all
[1:01:37] this had happened we went back home
[1:01:39] nothing happened for the first week the
[1:01:40] second week the husband calls me
[1:01:42] apparently I don't know how he got the
[1:01:44] messages asks me a question what's going
[1:01:47] on between you and my wife try to
[1:01:49] explain where you at this moment I was
[1:01:51] back home in your room no I was at work
[1:01:54] actually I was at work I was sitting in
[1:01:55] the office I received a call from a

[1:03:41] sorry because he's very Furious now hey
[1:03:44] don't tell him that you knew that I was
[1:03:45] married and all these things now look at
[1:03:47] the thing that I'm now in between now I
[1:03:50] tell you if there's a time that I prayed
[1:03:52] I went home I knelt down beside my bed
[1:03:55] before all this had happened my mom had
[1:03:57] told me my son I don't like the way that
[1:03:58] you're talking with this woman yeah
[1:04:00] because I I'm a woman I know women this
[1:04:03] is not going the way that you are
[1:04:04] thinking that it is going yeah she's
[1:04:06] getting too comfortable she's a married
[1:04:08] woman how can she get so comfortable to
[1:04:10] call you at around this time and what
[1:04:12] was your response my response was you
[1:04:14] know M you know in the world they do
[1:04:16] these things besides I know how to take
[1:04:19] care of myself so in my mind I'm like
[1:04:21] I'm dismissing mama you know what you
[1:04:23] have started my you know this this
[1:04:25] something that mothers have I think it's
[1:04:27] a gift that God actually gives them you
[1:04:29] know I like to believe that mothers are
[1:04:32] prophets yeah they can tell if something
[1:04:34] is going on in your life even before you
[1:04:36] tell them they can tell and ask you ah
[1:04:38] what's going on so my mother has got
[1:04:41] that she's
[1:04:42] got she's got this strong intuition she
[1:04:45] says certain things and we deny it
[1:04:47] everyone denies it then it goes exactly
[1:04:49] the way that she said like you see you
[1:04:51] remember that day I told you this and
[1:04:52] this and this and like yeah so I knew
[1:04:55] that my mom somehow she knows and this
[1:04:57] is what's going to what is going to
[1:04:59] happen but in my mind I was dismissing
[1:05:01] it so after that I went home I knelt
[1:05:03] down beside the bed I prayed and that's
[1:05:04] why really uh if you have a mother you
[1:05:07] need to listen to your mother definitely
[1:05:09] because God uses mothers God speaks to
[1:05:12] mothers and if only you can be able to
[1:05:14] listen to them uh if their counsel is
[1:05:16] Godly listen to it even if they're not
[1:05:19] Christians by the way even if they're
[1:05:21] not Believers still God uses them to
[1:05:24] help us and yeah and then you went down
[1:05:27] on your knees and started praying and I
[1:05:29] prayed and I told God God you know me I
[1:05:31] never touched that
[1:05:33] woman remember that day I was supposed
[1:05:36] to go with her but because of the fight
[1:05:38] that they had I did not go the end
[1:05:40] nothing happened so I had a basis to go
[1:05:42] before God with and I'm like God you
[1:05:44] know what I never touched that woman and
[1:05:46] and you are praying a prayer and I'm
[1:05:47] praying a
[1:05:48] prayer you actually of course I know you
[1:05:51] in desperation at this moment but you
[1:05:53] don't even have an idea I don't that it
[1:05:56] is God who actually let that happen so
[1:05:59] that you'll be able to come to him on
[1:06:01] that same basis on that same basis I did
[1:06:03] not know so I know done beside the bed
[1:06:05] God I promise if you get me out of this
[1:06:08] one I'm done with married woman with
[1:06:10] married women I'm never the funny thing
[1:06:13] is God hears and he heard me instantly
[1:06:16] that man never called me up to this day
[1:06:18] he never called me again he never sent a
[1:06:20] message to me again he just went quiet
[1:06:23] he just went silent
[1:06:26] you was going to come and shoot me HH he
[1:06:28] was going to kill me the wife told me
[1:06:30] says Prince this is a bad situation do
[1:06:34] not retaliate because he he always
[1:06:37] Carries a Gun things can go sideways he
[1:06:40] told me that I can make you disappear
[1:06:42] young man that's the husband there's
[1:06:44] nothing that you can do about
[1:06:46] it I can make you disappear just like
[1:06:49] that tell me a little more about the
[1:06:51] prayer you prayed and everything that
[1:06:53] you promised to God in that desperation
[1:06:55] mode in that desperation mode I promised
[1:06:57] God you know what God I'm done with this
[1:06:59] life if you get me out of this one I'm
[1:07:02] done I'm uh for me it's this is the end
[1:07:05] of it I'm coming back but you know God
[1:07:07] is God knows your heart God knew my
[1:07:10] heart that I was just saying this to get
[1:07:12] out of this
[1:07:13] situation even after I did I continued
[1:07:16] drinking I continued smoking until one
[1:07:20] day I remember very vividly I was so I
[1:07:22] would never used to get drunk
[1:07:24] I would drink everyone that I would
[1:07:26] drink with would get drunk but not me
[1:07:28] but on this particular day I got drunk
[1:07:30] and I told myself you know what let me
[1:07:32] just go in the house and just wash my
[1:07:33] face I entered into the house went and
[1:07:35] stood before the mirror it was dark I
[1:07:38] stood before the mirror past I felt
[1:07:40] convicted I looked at myself it's like I
[1:07:43] could see inside myself I felt so
[1:07:45] convicted God what am I doing I'm
[1:07:48] drifting I'm lost I started crying I had
[1:07:52] my hands on the sink there te tears
[1:07:54] falling down my face God I'm never going
[1:07:56] to get to do this this is the last time
[1:07:58] that I'm going to drink I
[1:08:00] promise the next day I got so sick from
[1:08:04] the alcohol that I drunk last night I
[1:08:06] got so sick to the extent that I was so
[1:08:09] sick people they call it hangover but no
[1:08:11] that was not hangover I got so sick and
[1:08:14] that was the time that was close to the
[1:08:16] Easter meetings I think of the Year 2020
[1:08:19] or 2021 that time Pastor May Pastor was
[1:08:23] coming to know him preached for him some
[1:08:26] time last year he a very important
[1:08:28] someone in my life that I hold so dear
[1:08:31] because he plays a very pivotal and
[1:08:32] important Ro as I'm about to tell you so
[1:08:35] before that when he came I talked to him
[1:08:37] I spoke to him I remember these were the
[1:08:39] days that I was you know used to pray a
[1:08:41] lot I used to sing and people would get
[1:08:43] healed just from singing in church I
[1:08:45] would sing and someone would tell you
[1:08:46] you know what I was going through this
[1:08:48] when you sang this is what happened so
[1:08:50] that particular the the previous Easter
[1:08:52] meetings they came and they preached and
[1:08:54] I sang a
[1:08:56] song I found a friend a good friend in
[1:08:59] Jesus that's the song that I sang and
[1:09:00] the Holy Ghost came down then he came to
[1:09:02] me and he spoke to me afterwards says
[1:09:03] young man there's something that God has
[1:09:05] put on your life you know protect this
[1:09:08] gift very jealously I want to tell you
[1:09:11] women with this gift they like this be
[1:09:15] very careful but even though after that
[1:09:17] I went and did whatever I did when he
[1:09:19] heard when Pastor because he loved me so
[1:09:21] much when Pastor s told him that
[1:09:24] the young man is gone he got so hurt in
[1:09:26] his heart so when he came now 2021 I
[1:09:30] think to preach for us at the M Easter
[1:09:32] meetings I was not there I was at my gig
[1:09:34] playing at another church in the same
[1:09:36] vicinity same area the way that I was
[1:09:39] dressed so the previous night he calls
[1:09:41] my young brother says I have a burden in
[1:09:43] my heart I want to pray for your for
[1:09:45] your older brother but he's not here but
[1:09:47] I'm going to pray for you he prays for
[1:09:49] my young brother I'm not here I'm not
[1:09:50] there I'm home at the same night the
[1:09:53] same same night that he prays for my
[1:09:54] young brother that's the same night I
[1:09:55] wed to the mirror and felt so convicted
[1:09:57] in my heart God I'm not going to do this
[1:10:00] anymore on the more I was done with
[1:10:02] drinking I go to that church I start
[1:10:03] playing Bas something in me just tells
[1:10:05] me you know what young man just go to
[1:10:07] church I did not care how I was dressed
[1:10:10] the way that was I had this ripped jeans
[1:10:12] very nice sneakers you know I was you
[1:10:13] know this this young man you know I was
[1:10:16] playing at a certain church and you know
[1:10:18] you're trying to get the girls as you're
[1:10:20] playing and all these things so I go to
[1:10:21] church like that I sit in the back and
[1:10:24] after the service end back again in the
[1:10:25] back again after the service ends the
[1:10:28] pastor my says you know what young man
[1:10:30] I'm so happy to see you he never
[1:10:32] mentioned anything about you know what
[1:10:34] you've been doing and all these things
[1:10:35] no he did not do that he showed me love
[1:10:38] yeah I'm so happy that you are back you
[1:10:39] know I that's what we need to do that's
[1:10:41] what we need to do I've been praying for
[1:10:43] you in fact yesterday I actually prayed
[1:10:45] for you and all these things and I tell
[1:10:47] you the next day after that the next
[1:10:50] week I told my friends that I was
[1:10:52] playing with in this churches my friends
[1:10:54] thank you so much you've been so kind
[1:10:56] we've played together for so long but
[1:10:58] you and I this is the way that we part
[1:11:01] ways I'm going back remember I so full
[1:11:04] of sins but I told God I you know you on
[1:11:07] Wednesday you preach the message that
[1:11:09] there is
[1:11:10] guilt you know false guilt personally I
[1:11:13] believe that what God the one that comes
[1:11:17] from God is actually not guilt I believe
[1:11:19] that it's conviction yeah that's what it
[1:11:21] is the devil makes you feel guilty yeah
[1:11:23] but God does not make you feel guilty
[1:11:25] God makes you feel convicted that's
[1:11:27] right so guilt takes you from the
[1:11:29] presence of God yeah but conviction
[1:11:31] brings you to God brings you to God so I
[1:11:34] was convicted I came to God I told God
[1:11:37] you know I did not have the power to
[1:11:38] confess then I was just coming to church
[1:11:40] with my sins every service I would go
[1:11:43] before the altar I would cry for my life
[1:11:45] God help me you know the way the things
[1:11:47] that I've been through the things that
[1:11:48] I've done I don't deserve to be here I
[1:11:51] would cry with my life every single day
[1:11:54] until one day God just spoke in a
[1:11:56] certain way that he spoke to me I went
[1:11:58] to the pastor I sat down with him Pastor
[1:11:59] you know what I've come to to make my
[1:12:02] life right I'm going to tell you
[1:12:03] everything even the things that I've
[1:12:04] confessed before I want to turn over a
[1:12:07] new live I sat down with the pastor I
[1:12:08] confessed my sin so bitter in my heart I
[1:12:11] got so bitter you know when you're out
[1:12:13] there let me tell you one thing that I
[1:12:14] know when you are a child of God and you
[1:12:16] have gotten the knowledge of the truth
[1:12:18] and you go out there in the world to sin
[1:12:20] you have no peace yeah at all I had no
[1:12:24] peace I wouldn't sleep at night when
[1:12:25] everyone is sleeping even up to today
[1:12:27] I'm still affected by it I don't sleep
[1:12:29] people can sleep everyone else can sleep
[1:12:31] me I'm always awake M now I get awake I
[1:12:35] read the Bible I I I listen to music and
[1:12:39] I listen to the tapes now but back then
[1:12:41] it was me and my thoughts where am I
[1:12:43] going what is my life going to be like
[1:12:46] but I had no power to overcome but still
[1:12:48] I would feel so guilty the way of a
[1:12:50] transgressor is hard I lost appetite for
[1:12:52] food I got into anxi anxiety anxiety
[1:12:55] turned into depression I started to look
[1:12:58] at you know my these other people that I
[1:12:59] used to go to church with you know they
[1:13:01] have gone so far in their life and I'm
[1:13:03] so I'm still behind I don't have any
[1:13:05] money all the money that I used to have
[1:13:07] I I don't have it anymore I used to go
[1:13:10] in these clubs and I would and I
[1:13:12] remember even after coming back to
[1:13:13] church I had this other gig that I had
[1:13:16] at this other club called Milan it's a
[1:13:18] family restaurant so it was a
[1:13:20] competition for vocals I would go there
[1:13:22] I would sing and I actually
[1:13:24] the in the competition when others went
[1:13:26] to youth in Z I did not go to youth
[1:13:29] because I had a gig that I had to go to
[1:13:31] on Saturday my my my and I had to go and
[1:13:34] sing and I went and I sang and I won
[1:13:37] they gave me money
[1:13:38] $500 you see other people started giving
[1:13:42] me contracts this and that but I had to
[1:13:43] turn those contracts down because now I
[1:13:45] had given I had made a choice I I want
[1:13:47] to go back to church and the way that I
[1:13:49] did it was because I said I want to buy
[1:13:50] a bass guitar for myself so I'm just
[1:13:52] going to go to that compet win the money
[1:13:53] and B buy the bass guitar and I did I
[1:13:55] bought the Bas I actually brought it to
[1:13:57] church it was dedicated in church that
[1:13:59] bass guitar that I got there and I
[1:14:01] played it in church for some time until
[1:14:03] I started feeling guilty you know we
[1:14:05] started having these all nights with
[1:14:06] these brother other brothers friends of
[1:14:07] mine you know brother brother Michael
[1:14:12] Brother Martin schum you've met brother
[1:14:14] yes we used to go to the mountains
[1:14:16] brother far Elisha would go to the
[1:14:19] mountains and pray and we told ourselves
[1:14:21] that young men we are going to be very
[1:14:22] honest with one not this is a safe space
[1:14:25] if you have anything that is bothering
[1:14:26] you when we come here before we pray
[1:14:28] let's talk about it talk about so I
[1:14:30] would tell them you know me I'm having a
[1:14:32] problem I'm failing to let go of this
[1:14:34] girl that I'm dating I was dating a very
[1:14:35] beautiful young woman there very
[1:14:38] prosperous coming from a very rich
[1:14:40] family you know she was a musician as
[1:14:43] well a very prominent musician she was
[1:14:45] loved by so many even the people in
[1:14:47] politicians who had money they actually
[1:14:49] wanted her but she would reject because
[1:14:51] she Li she liked me so I couldn't let
[1:14:53] her AG go for me it was like it was a
[1:14:54] drug but every time I would go up that
[1:14:56] mountain I would tell them my friends
[1:14:57] I'm failing to overcome this issue I'm
[1:14:59] failing to overcome this issue of
[1:15:00] playing in and singing in clubs and all
[1:15:03] and they would pray for me we would pray
[1:15:05] together there was no
[1:15:07] judgment Brothers I'm I'm I'm troubled
[1:15:10] but you know the spirit of pornography
[1:15:12] and masturbation would pray about it and
[1:15:15] one day I tell you God is the prophet
[1:15:17] says even when you you sin do not run
[1:15:21] from the presence of God stay there stay
[1:15:23] there
[1:15:23] God one of these days is going to find
[1:15:25] Mercy for you exactly he's going to meet
[1:15:27] you at your point of need so he met me
[1:15:29] at my point of need I came back I
[1:15:31] confessed my life Slowly by slowly
[1:15:33] slowly by slowly slowly by slowly all
[1:15:35] these things passed away all these
[1:15:36] things went they just died and went so I
[1:15:39] started you know I had a conviction in
[1:15:41] my heart you know what I I feel like I
[1:15:42] want to go and preach in the streets
[1:15:44] there to let these other people know but
[1:15:46] I did not want but I I was afraid
[1:15:49] because in my mind I'm like is this even
[1:15:51] the will of God for me to do that before
[1:15:53] you get to the part of praying the part
[1:15:56] of uh
[1:15:57] preaching you you mentioned about these
[1:16:01] things CU you see you've taken quite
[1:16:04] some time talking about
[1:16:06] them but uh I am sure someone wants to
[1:16:10] hear a little more on how you were able
[1:16:12] to overcome them did they just evaporate
[1:16:16] did they just go did they go slowly they
[1:16:18] went
[1:16:20] immediately what what was the experience
[1:16:22] like okay for me the experience was it
[1:16:25] was a process it's not something that I
[1:16:27] was like I just woke up in the morning
[1:16:28] and I said you know what I'm done with
[1:16:30] this the same the way that I did with
[1:16:32] drinking beer and you know it was
[1:16:34] different now because this this thing
[1:16:38] had a different hold on my life you see
[1:16:41] I was an addict to these things like I'm
[1:16:45] I'm not I'm not ashamed to say it I was
[1:16:48] an addict to pornography sides I was an
[1:16:51] addict to sleeping around I was an
[1:16:53] addict to sex itself because remember
[1:16:56] there was a time I would have a
[1:16:56] girlfriend every other week and with
[1:16:58] this girlfriend is not just sitting down
[1:16:59] to talk no it wasn't you see so I became
[1:17:03] an addict so for me to let go of such
[1:17:05] things it was very hard but it took just
[1:17:08] praying praying going to the pastor
[1:17:10] every day Pastor you know what I fail
[1:17:12] again today the pastor would pray for me
[1:17:14] you know what but one thing that I tell
[1:17:16] you for you to
[1:17:17] overcome evil spirits have got uh uh a
[1:17:22] ground where they
[1:17:24] operate the reason why we fail to live a
[1:17:27] Victorious Life is you know you be you
[1:17:30] you're sining because you are living in
[1:17:32] Sodom you go and confess and after you
[1:17:34] confess you go back again to Sodom it's
[1:17:36] the breeding ground for that spirit that
[1:17:38] Spirit would still come back because you
[1:17:40] are giving it access you are enabling
[1:17:44] that Spirit to come to you so what I had
[1:17:46] to do was to change the people that I
[1:17:47] hang around with I had to change the
[1:17:49] influence so there are certain things
[1:17:51] that you had to intentionally do because
[1:17:53] of what you wanted to do exactly there
[1:17:55] are certain things that you have to do
[1:17:57] as a Christian intentionally because you
[1:17:59] know that if I continue along this path
[1:18:02] I'm going to end up here let so so you
[1:18:04] had to change your friends I had to the
[1:18:06] people you were hanging around the
[1:18:08] places you were going to what else did
[1:18:10] you have to change I had to change uh a
[1:18:13] lot of I had to change a lot of things
[1:18:14] Pastor I had to change uh the sites that
[1:18:17] I would even go to on my phone I had to
[1:18:19] change a lot of things I had to change
[1:18:22] the way that I dress
[1:18:24] I had to because there are certain
[1:18:25] spirits that come to you because of the
[1:18:27] way that you dress M you see now
[1:18:29] everything what about the songs I had to
[1:18:31] change my music that's one thing that I
[1:18:33] really had to change I had to delete I
[1:18:36] had more than I don't
[1:18:38] know more than 100 or 200 albums by emm
[1:18:42] by JayZ by you know this Bob males by
[1:18:46] the Nina Simons but I knew a lot of
[1:18:48] these musicians but I had to change
[1:18:50] every music that I had because the
[1:18:52] spirit feed on those things on those
[1:18:55] things they feed on those things you see
[1:18:58] the prophet gives an example and says
[1:18:59] there was this a pachy person who had
[1:19:02] two dogs he says I have two dogs in in
[1:19:04] me they always fighting the white dog
[1:19:06] and the black dog and the prophet said
[1:19:07] which dog wins the fight says the one
[1:19:10] that you feed the most so that's just
[1:19:12] how it is you know you've got this flesh
[1:19:14] you are human no matter how saved you
[1:19:16] are yeah no matter how filled with the
[1:19:18] Holy Ghost you are you are human as long
[1:19:19] as you in this flesh you are susceptible
[1:19:22] to falling into sin exactly you see now
[1:19:24] but now what gives you the power to
[1:19:25] overcome is what do you feed on you have
[1:19:29] got to change your diet because you are
[1:19:30] what you eat if you Feast on worldly
[1:19:33] things that flesh will overcome if you
[1:19:35] Feast on the word of God that spirit
[1:19:38] that is in you that will what it will
[1:19:39] overcome that's right so I had to change
[1:19:41] everything I had to change my music I
[1:19:43] had to change the places I used to hang
[1:19:45] around I had to intentionally these
[1:19:47] things remember you have to do them
[1:19:48] intentionally you have to come to a
[1:19:50] decision and say you know what I'm not
[1:19:51] going to hang around you anymore yeah
[1:19:53] some of them you actually had to tell
[1:19:55] them to their face and say you know what
[1:19:56] my friend I think where I'm going and
[1:19:58] where you want to go there are two
[1:19:59] different places I'm now a Christian ah
[1:20:02] you you seem to like your beer too much
[1:20:04] me I a Christian we don't have any
[1:20:06] grounds for communication anymore we've
[1:20:08] got to part ways I'm not doing this
[1:20:09] because I resent you I I hate you no I'm
[1:20:11] praying for you that one one of these
[1:20:13] days you follow in the same light that
[1:20:15] I'm what that I'm now walking in but as
[1:20:17] of our friendship mhm I'm sorry it has
[1:20:20] got to end here mhm that's how I had to
[1:20:23] overcome I had to spend more time with
[1:20:25] those Brothers I would go up the
[1:20:26] mountain with we we made we devised a
[1:20:28] way that we would meet even though we
[1:20:30] have nothing to do would just meet in
[1:20:32] town would sit would go for Bri would
[1:20:34] talk with just to you know keep yourself
[1:20:37] around you know such people and when you
[1:20:39] do so Pastor when you fall in sin when
[1:20:43] you just go around to hang with them you
[1:20:44] feel convicted in your
[1:20:46] heart after you have sinned to get to go
[1:20:49] around such you know such people to to
[1:20:51] just fellowship with them you feel so
[1:20:53] guilty what do you have to do you have
[1:20:55] got to go go and confess so it's an
[1:20:57] atmosphere now that is encouraging you
[1:20:59] to confess it's an atmosphere that is
[1:21:01] encouraging you to stay closer to
[1:21:03] God it's an atmosphere that is
[1:21:05] encouraging you to stay away from sin
[1:21:07] because you know that if I get into sin
[1:21:09] and I've got to meet those Brothers on
[1:21:11] Friday for all night you are so
[1:21:12] convicted that you know I cannot go and
[1:21:15] pray with them these guys have been
[1:21:16] praying they've been listening to the
[1:21:17] tapes they've been you know testifying
[1:21:19] and I'm coming with my sin in you know
[1:21:22] the of these people I've got to make my
[1:21:24] life right yeah so in other words you
[1:21:26] had to change um the places you went to
[1:21:30] the friends you kept your contact list
[1:21:33] contact L your contact CH and and you
[1:21:35] know have a new contacts and people you
[1:21:38] are now whatsapping and texting back and
[1:21:40] forth and you also have to change your
[1:21:42] music you had to change your dressing
[1:21:44] you had to change looks like you had to
[1:21:47] do a real change yeah it was a revamp a
[1:21:51] renovation of a lot of things but
[1:21:53] remember these things you don't just let
[1:21:54] them go it's slowly by little by little
[1:21:59] intentionally taking the right step the
[1:22:01] right direction exactly intentionally
[1:22:03] sometimes you let go of you know uh
[1:22:06] dressing a certain way but maybe two
[1:22:08] weeks later you find yourself you know
[1:22:10] what I missed the way that I was used
[1:22:11] that I used to dress it was free you
[1:22:13] know you'd go back there but then You'
[1:22:15] feel you know what I've got to the
[1:22:16] extent that I remember when you came I
[1:22:18] used to wear these really really tight
[1:22:20] jeans you remember then you talk to me
[1:22:22] about it but you know it's something
[1:22:24] that I had to grow out of slowly I used
[1:22:27] to wear ried jeans yeah even my friends
[1:22:29] at church they knew Prince even always
[1:22:31] ripped jeans to church yeah these ones
[1:22:33] with you know I would just put something
[1:22:34] underneath so that it doesn't show my
[1:22:36] skin but it was ripped anyhow I remember
[1:22:38] telling I was like this this young man
[1:22:40] has something but how well these jeans
[1:22:43] are too tight I had to tell you brother
[1:22:45] Prince this jeans are too tight exactly
[1:22:48] yeah it looks like you're poured into it
[1:22:50] exactly I don't know what you thought of
[1:22:51] me when I said that
[1:22:53] exactly so it's it's one of those things
[1:22:56] but you the more the love that you have
[1:22:59] for God the prophet says it's your
[1:23:01] attitude yeah towards God that's right
[1:23:03] you see that and the another thing that
[1:23:06] I want to tell you people it's not you
[1:23:08] that has got to try mm because as long
[1:23:10] as you try as long as it's you that is
[1:23:11] trying you can never overcome that's
[1:23:14] right you have got to come to a certain
[1:23:16] point where you say you know what God
[1:23:17] I've tried so many times you know on
[1:23:19] Wednesday I I ministered you refer to
[1:23:21] that in your speech uh on false guilt
[1:23:28] and I spoke a little bit about God is
[1:23:31] righteousness there's so much about
[1:23:33] people thinking that it's all about uh
[1:23:35] when we talk about Holiness and
[1:23:37] righteousness It's All About Us trying
[1:23:39] to be like God trying to be holy it has
[1:23:42] nothing to do with you or with me it has
[1:23:45] all to do with him you see it is his
[1:23:47] righteousness that he has imputed unto
[1:23:50] us by faith cuz you see the only thing
[1:23:54] you have to do is to believe you know
[1:23:56] like you believe that this is not you
[1:23:58] this is you and you desire to be
[1:24:01] righteous and you desire to be so then
[1:24:03] you by faith took steps towards the
[1:24:07] direction which you desired to go into
[1:24:10] and then God in the process gave you his
[1:24:13] righteousness you see I think it's in
[1:24:15] the message who is God the prophet says
[1:24:17] that if you say you are a drunkard and
[1:24:21] you want to drink don't worry
[1:24:22] you'll start drinking if you say you are
[1:24:25] a sinner and you want to sin don't worry
[1:24:26] about it just along the line you'll
[1:24:28] start sinning because God will make your
[1:24:31] body fall into subjection to your
[1:24:33] confession is the high priest of our
[1:24:35] confession exactly you read a scripture
[1:24:37] they overcame with the blood of the lon
[1:24:38] the word of their what their testim of
[1:24:40] their testimony you've got to want it
[1:24:42] yeah you've got to want to change yeah
[1:24:45] you've got to say I will change and you
[1:24:48] have got to surrender to God and say you
[1:24:49] know what God it has got to be you doing
[1:24:51] it in me I'm surrendering mhm when you
[1:24:54] fall do not beat yourself too much when
[1:24:57] you fall go back to God and confess God
[1:25:00] I'm sorry I did not want to do this you
[1:25:02] know in my heart I don't want to sin
[1:25:04] against you you pray about it and God I
[1:25:07] tell you this things will just fall beat
[1:25:10] by beat fall the more that you build a
[1:25:12] relationship with God the more that you
[1:25:15] spend more time in prayer with God
[1:25:17] certain things just begin to drop off
[1:25:19] exactly it's an atmosphere it's like a
[1:25:21] rocket a rocket before it's launched
[1:25:23] it's as big as this bottle M when it's
[1:25:25] launched it gets to a certain level it
[1:25:27] drops something it goes higher it goes
[1:25:29] to a certain level it drops something it
[1:25:31] goes higher until it's only the capsule
[1:25:33] with the astronauts inside that's the
[1:25:36] same way it is in Christianity the more
[1:25:38] that you go higher with God the more
[1:25:41] things begin to drop because that
[1:25:43] atmosphere does not allow you to get in
[1:25:46] that atmosphere with certain things
[1:25:48] they've got to naturally they will drop
[1:25:50] on their own it's just like uh when I
[1:25:52] was in primary school there were certain
[1:25:53] friends that I used to play with when I
[1:25:55] got to grade seven and I passed my grade
[1:25:57] seven some of them failed if they just
[1:26:00] dropped off I did not go to them and say
[1:26:01] stop playing with me anymore them
[1:26:04] themselves they just felt you know what
[1:26:05] this guy is now going to high school we
[1:26:07] are we have got to go back to to primary
[1:26:09] school and you know what your
[1:26:11] conversations they they became different
[1:26:14] when I passed my old level certain
[1:26:15] people that did not pass my their all
[1:26:17] level with me they just dropped off the
[1:26:19] same way when I went to University the
[1:26:20] same way it is when you get in in Christ
[1:26:23] they will just drop off on their own
[1:26:25] these people they start to see you know
[1:26:26] what every time they start to want to
[1:26:28] speak vulgar you're like please when I'm
[1:26:31] around please don't don't talk like this
[1:26:33] all of a sudden they start to feel guilt
[1:26:34] and say this one is holier than thou do
[1:26:36] you do you know do you actually know
[1:26:38] that song of set your wings on the Winds
[1:26:41] of Faith yes I know it ahuh you can s
[1:26:44] that chorus is exactly what you are
[1:26:46] saying talking about exactly so uh
[1:26:49] that's how it is these things will begin
[1:26:52] begin to fall off but remember it is not
[1:26:54] you that has got to do it yeah youve
[1:26:56] just got to want it in your heart yeah
[1:26:58] and you you said something that it is
[1:27:01] your faith yeah someone asked me a
[1:27:03] question yesterday actually after the
[1:27:04] service I was out there you know a
[1:27:06] certain sister walked up to me and asked
[1:27:07] you know brother Prince you've spoke
[1:27:09] I've heard you speak about your
[1:27:10] testimony but I want to ask you how do
[1:27:12] you overcome such things because
[1:27:14] remember you know what it's hard you
[1:27:16] know what and I said you know why it's
[1:27:18] hard it's because you are the one who's
[1:27:19] trying yeah you are trying that's why it
[1:27:21] is hard yeah the very moment you stop
[1:27:23] trying become Christianity must not even
[1:27:25] be hard it must not it must be it's a
[1:27:28] life it's not like it's hard for you to
[1:27:29] Blink yeah it's not because it's part of
[1:27:32] who you are so if Christianity is part
[1:27:34] of who you are and it's God who has got
[1:27:36] to do it these things will just go and
[1:27:39] they'll just fall away yeah so you said
[1:27:42] something about you know it being uh
[1:27:45] faith faith the Bible says faith cometh
[1:27:47] by hearing and hearing the word of God
[1:27:50] if you stay away from the from the word
[1:27:51] of God
[1:27:52] you will never have the faith to believe
[1:27:54] for your salvation and your Victory or
[1:27:56] to even overcome at all you will never
[1:27:58] you will live a defeated life you see
[1:28:00] now if you want to see the prophet
[1:28:02] actually speaks about and says for you
[1:28:04] to if you want to see um the devil can
[1:28:06] only get to you when you go outside of
[1:28:10] that blood of Christ mhm when you step
[1:28:12] outside of the blood then the devil has
[1:28:14] got you mhm you see now so you've got to
[1:28:16] stay in that City of Refuge and the word
[1:28:18] of God is that City of Refuge young
[1:28:20] people we have got to stay glued to the
[1:28:22] word of God that's right we are wasting
[1:28:24] so much time on Instagram we are wasting
[1:28:26] so much time on Facebook we are wasting
[1:28:28] so much time on so many things a day
[1:28:30] that is 24 hours you realize that 20
[1:28:32] hours or 18 hours you're on your phone 3
[1:28:36] hours you sleep you only have 1 hour to
[1:28:39] read the Bible you have one hour to pray
[1:28:41] you have 1 hour to do all these things
[1:28:42] and to do other things as well so you're
[1:28:44] now just squeezing in God for 5 minutes
[1:28:46] you know what just for 5 minutes with
[1:28:48] God just for 5 minutes to read just one
[1:28:50] chapter or a quotation that has been
[1:28:51] posted by another sister on their status
[1:28:53] that's the one that you reading you like
[1:28:54] I know what I read the quotation today
[1:28:56] so I can pray but that's not the prophet
[1:28:58] says now other people will actually take
[1:29:01] their WhatsApp and uh activate all the
[1:29:05] other chats and groups and all the
[1:29:07] church groups and the the the the
[1:29:10] Believers and whatever whatever to do
[1:29:13] with with church and you know the word
[1:29:15] of God and God they will archive it
[1:29:18] that's very true okay and then you just
[1:29:21] come back to when you feel you have a
[1:29:23] moment you're bored and you're free we
[1:29:25] just give you 10 minutes and just go
[1:29:27] through it and then you're like okay now
[1:29:29] that's a day just to silence your
[1:29:30] conscience yeah just exactly I've been
[1:29:33] there I know exactly what it is it's to
[1:29:35] silence your conscience it's not because
[1:29:37] you love God but your conscience is
[1:29:39] telling you man you've spent too much
[1:29:40] time watching movies yeah um come on you
[1:29:43] start to feel something you you know
[1:29:44] then you're like I know what let me just
[1:29:46] quiet this voice and just kneel down
[1:29:47] besides the bed for 5 minutes and pray
[1:29:49] yet the prophet says if you spend 3
[1:29:51] hours in the world World equal amount of
[1:29:53] time in prayer you see now you've got to
[1:29:55] spend that equal amount of time think
[1:29:57] that you have had 18 hours you are
[1:30:00] looking at this Instagram post these
[1:30:02] naked women you're looking at all these
[1:30:03] things you're looking at this one
[1:30:05] dressing this certain way this one they
[1:30:07] speaking a certain language there's a
[1:30:09] certain music that is playing there and
[1:30:10] in your mind that song is already
[1:30:12] playing you are harming it and you're
[1:30:13] not even aware that you are harming the
[1:30:15] song that was sung by Beyonce some some
[1:30:17] time ago you are Hing it but you saw it
[1:30:18] on what you saw it on Instagram
[1:30:21] Instagram whatever you asked me in the
[1:30:23] afternoon there's this song that I was
[1:30:25] singing that song it stuck with me
[1:30:28] because I was on Instagram looking at
[1:30:30] this other friend of mine he's a basist
[1:30:33] he's the one who taught me bass his name
[1:30:35] is called Liberty know really so I was
[1:30:37] he was he played a cover to that song
[1:30:40] and I listened I I was like you know
[1:30:42] what this guy knows how to play I
[1:30:44] switched off my phone and it's been two
[1:30:46] days now I've been singing that song
[1:30:47] back to
[1:30:49] back I've been singing But simply
[1:30:51] because I saw it on an Instagram real
[1:30:53] now imagine how many things you seeing
[1:30:55] on an Instagram real some of the things
[1:30:57] are not music but they get in your mind
[1:31:00] they influence you how you think along
[1:31:03] the line you see now you well some of us
[1:31:05] at some point I had to delete Facebook I
[1:31:08] had to delete you know all those
[1:31:10] Instagram and you know social medias I
[1:31:12] had to completely delete it off off of
[1:31:14] my phone because I needed time to focus
[1:31:18] to focus on the ministry to focus on
[1:31:22] um on on time with God on family on on
[1:31:26] on you know studying you know for the
[1:31:29] ministry and and things so you see if
[1:31:33] you know what is good for you you
[1:31:34] intentionally do things to help you
[1:31:38] achieve the desired end that's and you
[1:31:40] were going to say the prophet said
[1:31:41] something and then I interrupted you I
[1:31:42] don't know whether you remember what you
[1:31:43] wanted to say uh just now yeah a few a
[1:31:46] while ago uh I forgotten well then again
[1:31:50] you were talking about prayer and how
[1:31:52] prayer really got you to this place uh
[1:31:55] of of Victory you know it it was yes I I
[1:31:58] know I all this came because I was
[1:32:00] asking you to tell us a little more on
[1:32:02] how you overcame these things and U then
[1:32:05] of course prayer coupled with prayer it
[1:32:06] was not only going slowly by slowly and
[1:32:09] hearing the word but also prayer prayer
[1:32:11] exactly and you were not praying alone
[1:32:14] you had a group and a team that you
[1:32:16] praying together so you see we have to
[1:32:18] pray one for another the Bible says
[1:32:20] confess your faults your sins to another
[1:32:22] and pray one for another and and so
[1:32:25] that's very important I believe that
[1:32:27] that was part um has formed part of your
[1:32:29] victory yeah that's very true and so so
[1:32:31] then you said you came to now a place
[1:32:33] where you now can say that is behind me
[1:32:36] exact drinking is behind me smoking is
[1:32:38] behind me women is behind me or do you
[1:32:40] still go back to this
[1:32:43] stuff
[1:32:46] no so yesterday when I was having that
[1:32:48] conversation with that sister she says
[1:32:50] you know what but sometimes you you feel
[1:32:51] like you know what I want to do this and
[1:32:53] I say you know what the reason why you
[1:32:55] want to do it is because the desire is
[1:32:57] still in you you are running from sin
[1:32:58] with your body but your heart still is
[1:33:00] in it yeah your body is the one that is
[1:33:03] running but your heart is still there
[1:33:06] your heart still desires so as long as
[1:33:08] your heart is still there as long as you
[1:33:09] still have that desire for sin yeah no
[1:33:11] matter how much you might try to avoid
[1:33:13] it you will go back to it yeah you see
[1:33:15] now you will still go back to it so I I
[1:33:17] can safely say that God has worked on
[1:33:20] the desire for me it has been the desire
[1:33:23] that God took care of of these things I
[1:33:25] used to like whiskey a lot I used to
[1:33:28] like it it about it they used to have um
[1:33:32] this some Believers even say it's not
[1:33:34] written anywhere that we should not
[1:33:36] drink so well then talk about this did
[1:33:38] God take away that desire for whiskey
[1:33:40] for me totally I used to love whiskey a
[1:33:43] lot Pastor you know that smelled just
[1:33:46] hey I feel like you know what I want to
[1:33:48] you feel you already in the anointing of
[1:33:50] whiskey and it's it's tastes sweeter you
[1:33:52] know than than all these other things
[1:33:54] it's so nice you know it's smooth it's
[1:33:57] you know it's got this thing to it plus
[1:34:00] you know when you are it's got the style
[1:34:03] that it has you know this guy has got
[1:34:05] style he drinks expensive beer you know
[1:34:07] what it's expensive so when I was there
[1:34:10] in the world I would never not at one
[1:34:12] point lack money to buy
[1:34:15] whiskey I was never too broke to get
[1:34:18] drunk I will tell you the honest truth I
[1:34:20] was never too broke
[1:34:22] goodness it was after I came into the
[1:34:23] message that I would fail to even get
[1:34:25] money to go to church but when I was out
[1:34:28] there every Friday we are going out
[1:34:30] every Friday we are going to drink and
[1:34:32] we we would spend more than $150 on
[1:34:35] different types of beer my god of
[1:34:37] whiskies and all those things but after
[1:34:39] that right now if I pass through by
[1:34:42] someone who has been drinking that smell
[1:34:45] on its own I feel like I want to vomit
[1:34:47] this is
[1:34:48] me and this is not only you my precious
[1:34:51] brother it is everybody that has
[1:34:53] received the doors of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:54] exactly and I I think this is where we
[1:34:57] need to tell the young people look you
[1:35:00] don't the moment you receive a dose a
[1:35:03] good dose of the Holy Spirit you will
[1:35:05] not even have to debate whether or not
[1:35:07] is written anywhere that you you should
[1:35:09] not drink you should not drink yes
[1:35:11] because you see the holy spirit will
[1:35:12] take away the appetite just like a drunk
[1:35:15] woman rather a pregnant woman if she's
[1:35:17] pregnant she doesn't have appetite for
[1:35:19] things she would normally do so we would
[1:35:22] normally want to drink would normally
[1:35:23] want to smoke would not normally want to
[1:35:25] go live immorally but you see when you
[1:35:28] receive a doors I call it the doors of
[1:35:30] the Holy Ghost amen when you receive
[1:35:31] that experience when you meet God first
[1:35:33] to first when you have that encounter
[1:35:35] with God when you have that experience
[1:35:37] that desire dies and it dies permanently
[1:35:41] it cannot stay right in there it caes
[1:35:43] can to the extent that you even detest
[1:35:46] the smell of whiskey exactly exactly so
[1:35:48] for me it's the smell on its own hey
[1:35:51] it's really you know I feel the that
[1:35:54] feeling that you you know what you want
[1:35:55] to throw up you
[1:35:57] know these days I'm I'm even allergic to
[1:36:01] smoke if I pass through by someone who's
[1:36:03] who smoking I get home my eyes are so
[1:36:07] itchy my nose is you know you having
[1:36:09] those G sounds in your ears you are
[1:36:12] constantly you know that's but I used to
[1:36:15] smoke mhm remember I used to smoke W but
[1:36:18] now if I just pass by someone who's
[1:36:20] smoking I already problems or the song
[1:36:23] says I've Been Changed exactly I've been
[1:36:25] reborn amen my whole life has been
[1:36:30] rearrange what a difference it makes you
[1:36:33] see when the Lord comes in your life he
[1:36:35] completely changes you whereby imagine a
[1:36:38] man who used to smoke but now would
[1:36:40] become allergic to smoke to smoke tell
[1:36:42] me about that tell me about that if it
[1:36:45] is not the Holy Spirit that's right so
[1:36:48] you see if anybody struggling with these
[1:36:50] things if you're struggling with
[1:36:51] pornography if you're struggling with
[1:36:53] smoking if you're struggling with
[1:36:55] immorality you don't need to beat
[1:36:57] yourself of or even try to stop all you
[1:37:01] need to do is to yield to the Holy
[1:37:03] Spirit and be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:37:05] the day you are filled with the Holy
[1:37:06] Spirit you will never have that desire
[1:37:09] again it dies permanently we are hearing
[1:37:12] brother Prince's testimony but but we've
[1:37:14] have we have a lot of testimonies of
[1:37:16] people like this that can tell you I had
[1:37:18] desire for this desire for that desire
[1:37:20] but now it's gone and you can't find it
[1:37:24] anymore
[1:37:25] it's you know you a new creation you
[1:37:28] know if we do not have people like you
[1:37:30] how can we even testify of the saving
[1:37:33] power and the redeeming power of the
[1:37:35] blood that's right you see brother
[1:37:37] Prince apart from communion I've never
[1:37:39] had whiskey in all my life I've never
[1:37:41] smoked I've never I remember when I was
[1:37:43] about 5 years or six years you know I we
[1:37:47] used to see people smoking you know on
[1:37:49] the road and so I picked a paper I said
[1:37:51] let me try smoking so I lit it and I put
[1:37:54] on my lips I coughed and coughed and
[1:37:56] coughed that was the last I said I'll
[1:37:58] never try again so so I do not know
[1:38:02] really what it feels like to smoke or
[1:38:04] what it feels like to drink or what it
[1:38:05] feels like so sometimes we preach these
[1:38:07] things and and the people be like ah
[1:38:09] Passa doesn't know what he's talking
[1:38:10] about because he has not experienced
[1:38:13] this kind of life he has never been into
[1:38:15] into the club so what about this man
[1:38:18] then what will you talk about this man
[1:38:20] you see I'll tell you it's not about
[1:38:23] whether I've experienced it or not if I
[1:38:25] preach it it's by inspiration and it
[1:38:28] works and here is a living testimony to
[1:38:31] tell you that no matter how much you've
[1:38:34] gone how deep in sin you've gone amen
[1:38:37] There Is Power in the Blood there is
[1:38:39] power in the in the power of the Holy
[1:38:41] Spirit the moment you receive the Holy
[1:38:42] Spirit you are changed and you are
[1:38:44] changed forever am and so brother you
[1:38:46] were then talking about when you receive
[1:38:48] this change and this experience with God
[1:38:50] then you took to street preaching yes I
[1:38:53] actually did take to street preaching uh
[1:38:56] it was after you had come and you you
[1:38:57] had spoken to me uh my dad always you
[1:39:01] know he always knew somehow he always
[1:39:03] spoke to me about it somehow you know I
[1:39:06] don't remember exactly what I spoke to
[1:39:08] you but I know that we were in in this
[1:39:12] campgrounds at at in guu gu yes and then
[1:39:16] I know you interpreted for me and uh as
[1:39:18] I was preaching I received the
[1:39:19] Revelation that this young man
[1:39:21] has Ministry blah blah blah I don't
[1:39:24] remember exactly how I phras it do you
[1:39:25] remember I do what what was the words
[1:39:28] after after after service I was in the
[1:39:30] tent you actually sent a brother to call
[1:39:32] me okay I was in the tent there so
[1:39:35] brother he came and said brother Prince
[1:39:38] Pastor TMA wants to talk to you okay so
[1:39:40] I came to the car where you were
[1:39:41] standing by the pastor's car and you
[1:39:43] said um young man you preach that's the
[1:39:46] word that's exactly what you said young
[1:39:47] man you preach I said uh no brother
[1:39:51] was there he can attest to this I said
[1:39:54] ah no and he said no I'm not asking you
[1:39:57] I am telling you I remember that yeah
[1:39:59] you actually said I'm not asking you I
[1:40:01] am telling you and I'm telling you this
[1:40:03] under inspiration when you were praying
[1:40:05] there you know the Holy Spirit came and
[1:40:08] I felt that I should come and pray with
[1:40:09] you I actually wanted to come and pray
[1:40:11] with you but the Holy Spirit told me no
[1:40:13] don't pray with him let me deal with him
[1:40:16] when he's there on the altar then after
[1:40:18] that then you spoke to me and said you
[1:40:19] know what um uh you are are you are you
[1:40:22] are you a preacher I said h no I Don't
[1:40:24] Preach you said I I'm I'm not asking you
[1:40:27] you even went to the extent of telling
[1:40:29] the pastor and you said Pastor said if
[1:40:31] you will not let this young man preach
[1:40:32] in your Pulpit the first time that he's
[1:40:34] going to preach on the pulpit will be in
[1:40:37] my church in Uganda and it happened
[1:40:40] exactly the way that the way that you
[1:40:42] said it so after that I I went and I
[1:40:44] spoke to the pastor and the pastor I
[1:40:47] remember he actually said you know what
[1:40:48] I know I think you remember he said I
[1:40:50] know that this young man has got yeah
[1:40:52] afterwards we spoke to him he said I I
[1:40:55] yeah I remember those he actually said
[1:40:56] that I know already so with Pastor s now
[1:41:01] he what he does is that he won't come
[1:41:04] and tell you you are supposed to come
[1:41:05] and preach in church yes says if God has
[1:41:08] called you to preach go and preach yes
[1:41:12] it does not necessarily mean go and
[1:41:13] preach in the church yes go and preach
[1:41:15] in the streets yes if God has called you
[1:41:17] to preach there's one way that you can
[1:41:20] that you can really know that God has
[1:41:21] called you to do something try it and if
[1:41:24] God is in it God will prosper it yes
[1:41:26] that's right so I was having this debate
[1:41:29] where I wanted to say I was having this
[1:41:30] debate in my heart should I should I not
[1:41:32] should I should I not go and just
[1:41:34] testify in the streets so I remember one
[1:41:37] day you know I had the Holy Spirit spoke
[1:41:40] in my in my heart countless times and I
[1:41:43] would say you know what I'm not going to
[1:41:44] do it I'm not going to do it I'm not
[1:41:45] going to do it then I remember one day I
[1:41:48] was in a in a texi going into town there
[1:41:50] was a man who was sitting in front of me
[1:41:52] he was he was drunk was holding a bottle
[1:41:55] he was drinking all of a sudden that man
[1:41:57] started to
[1:41:59] preach he started to preach the coming
[1:42:01] of the Lord is now I know you are
[1:42:02] judging me because I'm holding this
[1:42:04] drink I do not even want to drink myself
[1:42:06] you know what he was like so Frank and
[1:42:09] so open and he looked at me and said am
[1:42:11] I lying my brother am I lying he was
[1:42:14] asking me am I lying they said no you're
[1:42:16] not lying you're telling the truth I
[1:42:18] felt so convicted the Holy Spirit asked
[1:42:20] me a question
[1:42:21] so you are now going to let drunkards
[1:42:24] preach to You Preach to you instead of
[1:42:26] you preaching instead of you preaching
[1:42:27] to them I felt so convicted after that I
[1:42:30] went and I spoke to the pastor I said
[1:42:32] you know what pastor this is what I've
[1:42:33] been feeling yeah and the Pastor said my
[1:42:36] brother if God has called you to go and
[1:42:38] preach go and preach so after that we
[1:42:41] had an all night after praying and
[1:42:43] everything I was sleeping in my bed
[1:42:45] everyone slept so me I I hardly fall
[1:42:48] asleep so I was sleeping I was just
[1:42:50] laying in the the bed and I was thinking
[1:42:52] so with this whole preaching thing this
[1:42:54] whole street preaching thing
[1:42:55] heyh this is hard now this is
[1:42:59] hard so at the same time that I'm
[1:43:01] thinking about it a certain brother a
[1:43:03] friend of mine called brother job masasa
[1:43:05] sends me a short video of Pastor Perry
[1:43:08] green when he was talking of how he the
[1:43:11] prophet helped him to know the will of
[1:43:13] God in his life and said if you have a
[1:43:15] desire for it that's the first thing is
[1:43:17] it scriptural that's the second thing
[1:43:19] the third thing is good who Finance it
[1:43:22] that's how you get to know the will of
[1:43:23] God so at the same time I'm thinking I'm
[1:43:25] asking myself how do I know the will of
[1:43:26] God pertaining to this issue at that
[1:43:29] very same moment that brother out of the
[1:43:31] blue remember it's very very early in
[1:43:33] the morning he just sends me that that
[1:43:36] uh out of nowhere he just sends that to
[1:43:38] me I I read it I felt so convicted the
[1:43:42] next week we started this we called it a
[1:43:44] comie Ministry in the comes we know we
[1:43:46] just started as a joke we're sitting
[1:43:48] after church we would sit in the back of
[1:43:50] the of the combi there going into town
[1:43:54] soes taxis taxes exactly we call them
[1:43:57] comes back home so sitting there with
[1:44:00] the brothers just say brother you know
[1:44:02] you are going to make brother F to
[1:44:04] preach today in the comi we are just
[1:44:07] going to make him to preach today don't
[1:44:08] tell him about it so when everyone sits
[1:44:10] in the com and it's going home in the
[1:44:12] taxi one brother will just say uh good
[1:44:14] evening parents I would like to greet
[1:44:16] you all in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:44:17] Christ you know what we we just coming
[1:44:19] from church today and we have a brother
[1:44:20] with us today is feeling you know the
[1:44:22] push of God in his life to just share
[1:44:24] with you a few words brother far is
[1:44:25] going to preach to you today brother far
[1:44:27] is not even aware that this is what is
[1:44:28] going

[1:44:32] far has got nothing to do now he's got
[1:44:34] to speak something after he speaks he
[1:44:36] says like brother Prince is going to
[1:44:38] speak as well you know so it just
[1:44:40] started something like that and it
[1:44:42] graduated it graduated graduated until
[1:44:44] one know of this days I went into the
[1:44:46] into the streets there I just said God
[1:44:48] I'm just going to go there I just went
[1:44:50] and that's just how this whole preaching
[1:44:52] thing started preaching in the streets
[1:44:54] and I remember one day was very vividly
[1:44:57] I was supposed to go with some of the my
[1:44:59] friends to go to preach together they
[1:45:01] did not show up and I told God and I'm
[1:45:04] like today I'm tired and my friends did
[1:45:06] not come so I'm going home I was in the
[1:45:09] office I'm going home the holy spirit
[1:45:12] said there are there your friends that
[1:45:15] called you to do this mhm that today you
[1:45:17] will tell me that because your friends
[1:45:20] did not not come so you are not going to
[1:45:21] go mhm it's your friends that called you
[1:45:24] to do this oh you preach because of your
[1:45:26] friends they said you know what I'm just
[1:45:28] going to go home and he said go home you
[1:45:31] want to go home go and let's see if
[1:45:33] you're going to get there Pastor I I
[1:45:37] shook in my shoes that voice was so
[1:45:40] vivid he said you want to go home go
[1:45:42] home and see if you're going to get
[1:45:43] there go home I remember the only thing
[1:45:46] I remember is I was holding a Bible in
[1:45:49] front how I left the office I don't know
[1:45:52] I remember I'm just standing there in
[1:45:53] front of the people at this passport
[1:45:56] office the passport office is there
[1:45:57] where there so many people there this
[1:45:59] now no it's in gu I'm standing there in
[1:46:02] front of you know and I'm with my Bible
[1:46:04] and I'm reading it was already too late
[1:46:06] that was the same one that I was
[1:46:07] preaching there it was already too late
[1:46:09] and I'm preaching to them I don't even
[1:46:11] know how I go there I don't know but
[1:46:13] what I know is after that Simon three
[1:46:16] people came to me they gave me their
[1:46:17] number brother you know what I I really
[1:46:19] like the way that you preaching you know
[1:46:21] what this these are my numbers and I
[1:46:23] sent them over to my pastor and said you
[1:46:24] know what my pastor can actually help
[1:46:26] you you know better than I can I'm just
[1:46:28] here just to just to let you know and
[1:46:30] all these things happened then I moved
[1:46:32] to AR I started preaching on First
[1:46:34] Street met also friends there who were
[1:46:36] preaching on First Street and I would
[1:46:38] preach on First Street went to church
[1:46:39] met Pastor Chu from eastley who is the
[1:46:42] pastor for a satellite church eastley
[1:46:44] satellite church Ina one day he just
[1:46:46] calls me come brother and go and preach
[1:46:48] for us day for an all night we wa there
[1:46:51] and we preached and that's just a whole
[1:46:53] how this whole preaching and several
[1:46:54] Souls have come to the Lord through your
[1:46:56] Street Ministry they like do you have a
[1:46:59] few that you can tell us yes uh there's
[1:47:02] quite a few there's another brother
[1:47:03] called brother Simba brother Simba does
[1:47:06] not stay in guu he stays outside of gu
[1:47:08] but he was there because of school so he
[1:47:10] bothers me every time on my phone
[1:47:12] brother I no longer see you brother
[1:47:14] where are you brother you know all these
[1:47:15] things certain different people even in
[1:47:18] Harari I remember the last s that uh we
[1:47:21] preached on First Street it was the last
[1:47:23] Simon for last year on on Facebook it is
[1:47:26] there I was with brother Daniel Goda a
[1:47:29] friend of mine from Chim Mani came from
[1:47:32] from Chim Mani came to Har and said we I
[1:47:35] just felt like you and I should go there
[1:47:37] and just preach for just for the last
[1:47:38] time before the year ends we did and I
[1:47:41] that day I five Souls if I'm not
[1:47:43] mistaken five Souls came to the Lord
[1:47:45] Jesus Christ and so you can see there is
[1:47:48] fruit cuz you see by the B speaks of in
[1:47:51] the church age book of the way the
[1:47:54] pattern of every true Ministry and um
[1:47:58] how you are able to know that truly God
[1:48:00] has called you you see it has to be
[1:48:03] through that pattern like you know Paul
[1:48:06] was true to the word and uh you know we
[1:48:09] take the pattern of Paul because he was
[1:48:10] the first church age Messenger to the
[1:48:12] Lan uh to the to the Gentiles and so and
[1:48:16] and so he was sent to the eases but of
[1:48:18] course he was the one that opened the
[1:48:19] door for the Gentiles
[1:48:20] so we see that he was true to the word
[1:48:22] and also he he was a man of the spirit
[1:48:25] and as well as there was fruit in his
[1:48:28] ministry and so God manifested himself
[1:48:31] Vindicated him but also part of the
[1:48:34] Vindication is the fruit area exactly
[1:48:36] and you know if there is no fruit in
[1:48:38] what you doing then we don't we're not
[1:48:41] too sure if God has sent you or if God
[1:48:42] has sent you to so it's not about the
[1:48:44] maning God has sent you it's not even
[1:48:46] about you thinking or presuming it's
[1:48:49] about God confirming that I am with you
[1:48:51] I've sent you like he said I'll be with
[1:48:53] you and in you up to the end of the
[1:48:55] world up to the end of the world and so
[1:48:57] we see uh when it you know um I used to
[1:49:01] hear those testimonies oh I'm preaching
[1:49:03] on this street or I'm preaching on that
[1:49:04] street or this is happening or that is
[1:49:06] happening I was really encouraged by
[1:49:08] that and I really wanted you to come
[1:49:09] also to the
[1:49:11] meetings and uh it was very difficult
[1:49:14] but um you know at that last moment the
[1:49:17] Holy Spirit spoke to me vividly that I
[1:49:19] needed to invite you and and so that's
[1:49:21] why I did it I I don't usually do things
[1:49:24] uh just for just I usually do things
[1:49:27] even when I do not know why but if the
[1:49:29] Holy Spirit has told me I need to do
[1:49:31] this I do it and um to you who is
[1:49:36] hearing I know you've heard a few
[1:49:38] comments by the prince saying the Holy
[1:49:39] Spirit I'm saying the Holy Spirit you
[1:49:41] know God speaking God speaking and
[1:49:43] sometimes you've seen the message we
[1:49:44] don't want to hear such language but um
[1:49:48] the reason why I have
[1:49:51] had to say those comments as well is
[1:49:53] because I believe in the Holy Spirit and
[1:49:55] the work of the Holy Spirit and I know
[1:49:56] he speaks because the holy spirit is
[1:49:59] brother banam told us is not a thing
[1:50:01] he's a person and and he speaks so and
[1:50:05] if you do not know how he speaks you
[1:50:07] need to have an encounter with him and
[1:50:09] when you have an encounter with him once
[1:50:12] he will certainly speak to you in a way
[1:50:14] that you will understand and so uh I
[1:50:17] know it's been almost 2 hours and and uh
[1:50:20] we do not want to
[1:50:23] overstay and then the people will get
[1:50:25] tired especially those who will listen
[1:50:27] to this later
[1:50:28] on uh but do you have I have a few
[1:50:31] comments I wanted to read to you but
[1:50:33] before we do that uh and if anybody's
[1:50:35] following and you want to send a comment
[1:50:37] I'll read it while we are closing you
[1:50:39] can go ahead and do that maybe you can
[1:50:41] drop a comment on the on the chat here
[1:50:44] on on YouTube I'll read it maybe a
[1:50:46] message to brother Prince or
[1:50:48] anything uh you wanted to say something
[1:50:51] uh before we close okay yes before H
[1:50:55] many people will think that I'm a pastor
[1:50:57] no I not a pastor personally I don't
[1:51:00] believe God called me to be a pastor if
[1:51:02] there is one thing that I'm afraid of is
[1:51:04] being a pastor personally I just believe
[1:51:06] that I'm supposed to preach out there in
[1:51:08] the streets that's what I believe
[1:51:10] personally I'm just supposed you know
[1:51:12] just this guy that's what every preacher
[1:51:13] is supposed to exactly and number two
[1:51:16] the one one of the other ways of knowing
[1:51:18] that you are called of God in the
[1:51:20] Ministry you try to run away you try to
[1:51:22] say well I'm not anything I'm not even a
[1:51:24] preacher that's one of the ways we know
[1:51:26] cuz says the man that is fighting for it
[1:51:29] is not the man that is called for it but
[1:51:31] the man that is trying to run away the
[1:51:33] man that is that is the man for the job
[1:51:37] you see so that that's a clear sign my
[1:51:40] brother we've had you here minister to
[1:51:42] us and you've been a blessing twice you
[1:51:44] preached in our assembly and uh some
[1:51:46] pastors have also been informing me that
[1:51:48] they would want to hear you minister to
[1:51:50] them I know from here you'll also uh
[1:51:52] visit Kenya I know Saints from Kenya
[1:51:55] some of them will be watching this as
[1:51:57] well I know they'll be blessed by your
[1:51:59] ministry there especially having heard
[1:52:01] your testimony and uh I I personally
[1:52:04] really desired for you to speak to us
[1:52:06] and also share this testimony because
[1:52:09] young people need to know that this is
[1:52:11] not this is not something we've learned
[1:52:14] or this is not something that we are
[1:52:16] doing because um we are accustom to e
[1:52:20] this is an experience it's an experience
[1:52:22] we've gone through it is God that has
[1:52:24] made real uh this message to us and so
[1:52:26] it is something from the heart and not
[1:52:28] something from the head and uh also
[1:52:31] another thing that is significant there
[1:52:33] is to show that when God surely calls
[1:52:36] somebody and fills them with the w with
[1:52:39] the Holy Spirit and gives them an
[1:52:41] experience with him they'll be concerned
[1:52:44] see they'll be concerned uh it did not
[1:52:46] end like well then I became a very good
[1:52:50] church member you know and then when it
[1:52:54] happened I took to the streets I started
[1:52:57] Pastor s calls them good for nothing
[1:53:00] yeah there is a very good brother yeah
[1:53:02] but good good for nothing because he
[1:53:04] doesn't do don't be good for nothing do
[1:53:06] something for the Lord go on the streets
[1:53:09] and preach now we have YouTube go on
[1:53:11] YouTube get a channel preach sing do
[1:53:14] something for the Lord you know do
[1:53:16] tracks distribute them around the
[1:53:18] neighborhood even if you're assist you
[1:53:20] can distribute the St you can do do
[1:53:21] something for the Lord don't be too idle
[1:53:23] don't be good for nothing too good in
[1:53:26] the church but good for nothing do
[1:53:28] something for the Lord let us fire up
[1:53:30] this generation let let the people know
[1:53:32] let this generation know there are a
[1:53:35] people that are not like the world not
[1:53:38] in the world but we are not of the world
[1:53:41] and let them know that we have a message
[1:53:42] in the land God has sent a message a
[1:53:44] message of restoration let them know and
[1:53:47] who is going to let them know it is us
[1:53:50] yes sir it's not somebody coming from
[1:53:52] the moon or an angel coming with wings
[1:53:54] it is us that's right going to do that
[1:53:58] and so uh there there's somebody who was
[1:54:02] saying
[1:54:03] uh uh God Bless you that's a good
[1:54:07] testimony I think this is Brother
[1:54:08] Benjamin God bless you brother Benjamin
[1:54:11] someone was saying I'm touched by the
[1:54:13] warm testimony I felt God is telling me
[1:54:15] something God bless you your name is not
[1:54:18] so clear but
[1:54:20] at least you can know that the testimony
[1:54:22] has been a blessing to someone and God
[1:54:23] has been speaking to them and this is
[1:54:26] saying wow is this the
[1:54:28] brother uh is the brother still in
[1:54:33] Uganda yeah he still in Uganda I think
[1:54:36] these are the people who came to the
[1:54:37] meetings I remember the brother could
[1:54:39] sing oh yeah he could sing and yesu went
[1:54:42] in the world and sang and and the devil
[1:54:43] got him into trouble but Jesus took him
[1:54:46] out praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen
[1:54:50] uh he says that this is exactly what I
[1:54:52] wanted to tell brother Prince God called
[1:54:55] man always run away yeah yeah so your
[1:54:59] message has reached God called man
[1:55:02] always runs away and and that's the
[1:55:04] truth uh but they cannot run away
[1:55:07] forever the God will always uh get them
[1:55:11] back and I think this is the sister you
[1:55:13] were speaking to after the service uh
[1:55:16] that you refer to her little bit here I
[1:55:19] would not speak her name but you you
[1:55:21] remember her so she says pastor this is
[1:55:24] a private message to me I've got so
[1:55:26] convinced by this testimony I think I
[1:55:28] got a change and she's in tears I say if
[1:55:31] this is what it was all for then it's
[1:55:34] been worth it amen amen my
[1:55:37] sister if you you it's not a thought it
[1:55:41] is a revelation and inspiration that you
[1:55:43] have received and and we're going to
[1:55:45] pray for whoever that is struggling that
[1:55:48] uh God will be able to visit you like
[1:55:50] you visited our brother and brother I I
[1:55:53] really failed also to pray for you over
[1:55:55] something before we close uh that uh
[1:55:59] this after effect you know of whatever
[1:56:02] else you are in and you say that sleep
[1:56:05] the scripture says that God give gives
[1:56:08] his beloved sleep before we end this I'm
[1:56:11] going to pray that God will give you
[1:56:12] sleep in the night every night you will
[1:56:15] have if you want 12 hours sleep God will
[1:56:17] give it to you you don't have to take
[1:56:18] medicine for it you don't have to be
[1:56:20] worried cuz you see if it is restoration
[1:56:22] it has to be perfect restoration and
[1:56:25] there's a brother who says I mean I I
[1:56:28] just like the entire setup of this
[1:56:31] interview I just see a brother speaking
[1:56:33] his heart out to another brother wow God
[1:56:36] bless you and I said brother Jeffrey God
[1:56:38] bless you as well we really appreciate
[1:56:40] you and all the brothers and sisters
[1:56:42] that have been watching this so and I
[1:56:45] think we now need to pray I'm going to
[1:56:47] pray for you and you are going to pray
[1:56:49] for the listeners everybody else that
[1:56:51] has been struggling everybody else that
[1:56:52] has been going through things or maybe
[1:56:55] they've been going through things that
[1:56:56] you have uh or they going through things
[1:56:58] that you have been or you had been going
[1:57:01] through and I want you from your heart
[1:57:03] to speak to them your last words and
[1:57:05] also to pray for them from your heart
[1:57:07] that the Lord will do something for them
[1:57:10] okay thank you so much Pastor for the
[1:57:12] for the opportunity it has been really
[1:57:14] nice to be to be here and it if there's
[1:57:17] something that really touches my heart
[1:57:20] is to know that your testimony has
[1:57:23] touched another person amen you see God
[1:57:26] does those things for reasons that we
[1:57:28] might not know and I tell you today I
[1:57:30] used to regret this path that I had
[1:57:33] taken but now I don't even regret it
[1:57:35] because I know that the the footsteps of
[1:57:37] the righteous they ordered by the Lord
[1:57:39] yeah so what the the few words that I
[1:57:42] have got to say to you my fellow friends
[1:57:44] is that you have got to want the life
[1:57:48] you have got to want it
[1:57:50] you have got to confess it you have got
[1:57:52] to do things
[1:57:54] intentionally that self guard your
[1:57:56] salvation the Bible says work out your
[1:57:59] salvation with trembling and fear you
[1:58:01] have got to you see do not take this
[1:58:05] whole Christian uh life as a joke or as
[1:58:10] a job Christianity is not a job
[1:58:12] Christianity is life that's right
[1:58:15] Christianity is is clothed in blood you
[1:58:18] that's one thing that you have really
[1:58:19] got to be you know if God is jealous
[1:58:22] about anything in this world God is
[1:58:23] jealous about blood that's right to the
[1:58:25] extent that God said even the blood of
[1:58:27] animals you shall not eat it because
[1:58:28] there is life in the blood so if God is
[1:58:30] jealous about blood and this message is
[1:58:32] covered in blood if you take it for
[1:58:35] granted I tell you God will do something
[1:58:38] about it because he's jealous of blood
[1:58:40] people like Paul people like Peter
[1:58:42] people like Martin Luther people like a
[1:58:44] lot of those people those Saints of all
[1:58:46] they had to die for this gospel to
[1:58:48] mention even even God himself had to die
[1:58:50] for this gospel that we take so lightly
[1:58:53] as though it's something that I can do
[1:58:54] without you see please make a decision
[1:58:58] now before it is too late because there
[1:59:00] will come a time when you will want to
[1:59:02] make this decision but like Esau you'll
[1:59:05] seek for a place of repentance and find
[1:59:07] none while is it's still cold today
[1:59:09] before you even sleep if you have an
[1:59:12] opportunity to speak to your pastor if
[1:59:14] you have an opportunity to go to your
[1:59:15] parents and say mama I'm sorry please do
[1:59:18] it
[1:59:20] because tomorrow is not guaranteed to
[1:59:22] anyone of us so that's one thing that
[1:59:25] I've got to say to you you have got to
[1:59:26] want the life you have got to stay in
[1:59:29] prayer you have got to confess it you
[1:59:32] have got to do things to the best of
[1:59:36] your power there are some things that
[1:59:37] you have got to do Pastor God we believe
[1:59:40] God does things but there are some
[1:59:42] things that you have got to do yourself
[1:59:44] as a Believer that's right you see God
[1:59:46] will not come and wake you up in the
[1:59:48] morning at 3:00 a.m. and tell you wake
[1:59:49] up and pray youve got to make that
[1:59:51] decision yourself to wake up at 3:00
[1:59:53] a.m. and pray you see you've got to make
[1:59:56] that decision to confess your life God
[1:59:57] will not confess your life for you
[1:59:59] you've got to make that decision
[2:00:00] yourself to say you go God I don't want
[2:00:02] this anymore I want to live a clean life
[2:00:04] you have got to go with your own two
[2:00:06] feet and sit before the pastor or the
[2:00:08] elder or whoever it is even though it is
[2:00:11] it is very shameful for you to do that
[2:00:14] but it's necessary for you to do that
[2:00:17] and with those words friends God bless
[2:00:19] you you
[2:00:20] richly and uh there is um a sister that
[2:00:24] says they've been blessed so
[2:00:27] much uh and sister by faith with all our
[2:00:31] family and uh also sister Canim me says
[2:00:35] God bless you brother I think she's in
[2:00:38] Boston uh we would like to have you now
[2:00:41] pray for
[2:00:44] uh perhaps somebody's watching now or
[2:00:47] they will watch this later
[2:00:49] but they need to break out of certain
[2:00:53] things like these maybe it's alcohol
[2:00:55] maybe it's a spirit of um you know you
[2:01:00] know drinking or or smoking or women or
[2:01:03] men or you know immorality and and you
[2:01:06] see they do not know how to break out of
[2:01:08] it they want to break out of it they do
[2:01:10] not know how to maybe what the prayer
[2:01:13] can do is to bring them to a place amen
[2:01:16] where God can begin to work on them amen
[2:01:19] you know I I believe that prayer changes
[2:01:21] all things you know in your story as
[2:01:23] you're speaking to us it was prayer that
[2:01:25] did it as much as you hearing the word
[2:01:27] as much as you went to church as much as
[2:01:30] it is prayer amen first the prayer of of
[2:01:33] Pastor of your pastor then Pastor Mah in
[2:01:37] in in South Africa and then now you and
[2:01:40] your friends you see so as you know the
[2:01:44] prayer you're going to pray now might be
[2:01:46] like the prayer of Pastor Mah amen when
[2:01:49] he came in guu he never found you you
[2:01:52] were in some other churches and you know
[2:01:55] doing some gigs right there which I
[2:01:57] don't believe that any believer any
[2:01:59] musician should really do gigs you know
[2:02:02] cuz we've seen how far it can take a
[2:02:05] person and while you are there the holy
[2:02:08] spirit moves him to remember you he he
[2:02:12] calls you were not even there I was not
[2:02:15] but he calls your brother and he prays
[2:02:17] over your brother M by proxy on your
[2:02:21] behalf and that prayer met you where you
[2:02:25] were yeah and while looking at the
[2:02:28] mirror there it was it struck you amen
[2:02:31] prayer moves like waves prayer changes
[2:02:34] bam says it's the greatest weapon that
[2:02:36] we have ever been given and it started
[2:02:39] all by prayer and while you're praying
[2:02:42] now it might be through the waves we
[2:02:43] just right here inongo and um we SE uh
[2:02:47] around you know on these benches and
[2:02:49] some people are watching us maybe from
[2:02:51] so far maybe in some other country maybe
[2:02:53] from you know I don't know we we uh by
[2:02:56] following our statistics we we a lot of
[2:02:58] people follow this Channel and and you
[2:03:00] know listen you know we hear from them
[2:03:02] back and forth some from you know as far
[2:03:04] as the US and you know Canada very many
[2:03:08] from you know those places some even
[2:03:11] sometimes from New Zealand and you know
[2:03:13] across Africa many countries and I know
[2:03:16] somebody might watch this and they have
[2:03:17] been going through something and and uh
[2:03:20] this prayer will be a point of contact
[2:03:22] for them for God to begin a miracle in
[2:03:25] their life a miracle of change that's
[2:03:27] the greatest Miracle a miracle of
[2:03:28] Salvation yes so you know just be led by
[2:03:32] God and we just humble ourself and you
[2:03:35] pray for that
[2:03:38] person let's
[2:03:40] pray precious gracious Heavenly Father

[2:03:46] spirit and Brokenness of heart Jehovah
