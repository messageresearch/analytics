[42:30] English so we are reading Romans 11:
[42:35] 33 he
[42:42] says all the depth of Rich all the depth
[42:45] of the riches both of the wisdom and
[42:47] knowledge of God how uncatchable are his
[42:50] judgments and his ways past finding out
[42:54] for who has known the mind of the Lord
[42:57] or who has been his
[43:00] counselor or who has first given to him
[43:04] and it shall be recompensed unto him
[43:07] again for of him and through him andto
[43:12] him are all things to whom be glory
[43:17] forever amen let me read that verse

[43:35] the word father we would like to ask you

[43:49] stream this on their on their Zoom
[43:51] service in tonight Lord we commit all
[43:55] these Souls wherever they might be
[43:57] located father into your hands for you
[43:59] know what they need exactly what they
[44:01] need and I know you have the ability to
[44:04] take me out of the way as I take myself
[44:06] out of the way this evening that you
[44:08] will use me father to speak exactly what
[44:10] you know the people need to hear Lord
[44:13] what they do not need to hear may you
[44:15] block my mouth that I will not say it
[44:17] but whatever it is that you have
[44:18] designed and desired that I would say
[44:20] tonight Lord for I am your servant and
[44:23] and and reporting to duty tonight that
[44:25] you will use me as you have purposed in
[44:27] your own will that your purpose shall be
[44:29] accomplished in this service tonight we
[44:31] commit it into your hands in the name of
[44:33] Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated
[44:37] so this evening I am speaking on the
[44:40] subject of who is on the Lord's Side
[44:42] it's it's in a form of a question who is
[44:44] on the Lord's Side and I ask I ask I ask
[44:47] who is on the Lord's Side here tonight
[44:49] who is on the Lord's
[44:51] Side now I I I've started with the book
[44:54] of Romans I'll later on read in the Old
[44:56] Testament a few ver verses there but
[44:58] first I want uh this's a little thought
[45:00] I have this evening as I was studying it
[45:04] and um I trust that uh it will be a
[45:07] blessing to to the listeners today and
[45:10] and maybe this is for those who have
[45:13] been you know wondering which side they
[45:16] are on and sometimes in life you get to
[45:18] a place where you are what what the
[45:21] Bible would call a rock and a hard place
[45:25] and sometimes you need to make decisions
[45:27] sometimes uh you are confused and being
[45:30] pulled by this and that but time at
[45:33] times you really need to make up your
[45:35] mind on which side you are and I trust
[45:38] that by the end of the service we will
[45:40] all know whether we are on the Lord's
[45:42] Side or not praise the
[45:44] Lord
[45:45] so the reason why we sng that song you
[45:48] are God from beginning to the end I want
[45:50] I want to begin with a little uh going
[45:53] through that song a little bit he says
[45:55] you are God from beginning to the end
[45:58] that means you are the alpha and you're
[46:00] the Omega there is no place for argument
[46:02] there's not nothing no one we cannot
[46:04] argue about him being God from beginning
[46:06] to the end so you cannot argue about it
[46:09] there's no argument about it do we all
[46:11] say Amen to that you are God all by
[46:15] yourself you are God from beginning to
[46:17] the end and he says you've got times and
[46:20] seasons in your hands you you called for
[46:23] light out of Darkness you don't need a
[46:25] man to be the god you are but you have
[46:28] chosen to call me your own so we do not
[46:31] he does not need us to be God he was
[46:34] actually God before he even made us but
[46:37] he has chosen to call us his own and out
[46:40] of him we have come and the scripture we
[46:42] have read here in the Book of Romans he
[46:45] says for of him and through him andto
[46:49] him are all things so in other words
[46:52] everything has been made for him and
[46:55] everything is through him and everything
[46:58] is to him and everything and and all
[47:01] things are his and there is nothing made
[47:04] that is made without him in the Book of
[47:07] John chapter one he speaks a little bit
[47:09] about that all things were made by him
[47:12] praise the name of the Lord and so we
[47:14] see here he says uh all the depth of the
[47:18] riches of the wisdom and knowledge of
[47:20] God so God has more knowledge than any
[47:23] of us God has wisdom wisdom um he he
[47:28] says how unsearchable are his judgments
[47:30] and his ways past finding out on I don't
[47:34] know was it on Sunday when I spoke on on
[47:36] um on things to do with the will of God
[47:39] many times things happen in our life and
[47:41] we ask ourself uh that why did God let
[47:44] this happen I don't know how many have
[47:45] ever asked that question why did God let
[47:48] this happen why did he allow it to
[47:50] happen in other words you asking your
[47:53] yourself that question because you do
[47:55] not understand how God who is all
[47:57] knowing can let something like that
[47:59] happen because in your definition in
[48:01] your wisdom that thing was bad but I
[48:04] want to show you tonight that in the
[48:06] wisdom of God nothing is bad in the
[48:09] wisdom of God whatever he allows to be
[48:12] he allows it to be so that his name can
[48:15] be glorified and we as mortors as human
[48:18] beings we need to understand that God is
[48:20] wise God is knowledgeable God knows is
[48:24] all knowing and you know his judgments
[48:27] are unsearchable his ways are past
[48:30] finding and we have to trust him we have
[48:33] to come to a place where we have full
[48:35] confidence in him we have to come to a
[48:37] place where we we we are not coming with
[48:39] questions in our mind God will you be
[48:42] able to do this if I do this will you
[48:44] fulfill your promises whatever he has
[48:46] promised he's able to do whatever he has
[48:49] said that he will do he's able to do
[48:52] that is why we have this book called The
[48:54] Bible because if imagine if we did not
[48:57] have a Bible imagine I want you to
[48:59] imagine it in your mind if we didn't
[49:01] have a Bible we are going to be relying
[49:03] on preachers and people who each of them
[49:05] saying I'm speaking on behalf of God and
[49:08] whatever they would be speaking will be
[49:09] maybe sometimes contradicting each other
[49:12] and then we do not know should we take
[49:14] what pastor bosi preached to us or
[49:16] should we take what Pastor Joseph or
[49:17] Pastor whoever preached to us we we will
[49:19] be confused but God is God and and his
[49:21] ways are past finding you know because
[49:24] of his Sovereign wisdom and knowledge he
[49:26] decided to to give us his word
[49:28] hallelujah he inspired Men He inspired
[49:31] them amen to come up with with words and
[49:34] with words of wisdom this is let me put
[49:36] it this way it is the wisdom of God
[49:39] downloaded you remember when Moses went
[49:41] into the into the mountain and he came
[49:43] back with a with the Ten Commandments
[49:45] you know where did that come from it
[49:48] came where where was it it was on
[49:50] tablets it was on tablets now in in in
[49:54] in this Century we have what we call
[49:55] tablets iPad and we think we all oh
[49:58] wisdom has increased but God wrote we
[50:01] wrote words on a tablet ways away in the
[50:04] days of Moses he was the first one to
[50:07] formulate the first tablet and he wrote
[50:09] his word there on tablets of stones and
[50:12] and when he he he brought it you know
[50:15] where did it come from it came from the
[50:17] cloud praise the name of the Lord you
[50:19] know we have these days some of you who
[50:22] understand what I'm talking about we
[50:23] have what they call the cloud the cloud
[50:25] is like you know some these days when
[50:27] your tablet or when your iPad or when
[50:29] your whatever phone gets full you can
[50:32] buy space on the cloud you don't need to
[50:35] buy a memory card or you don't want you
[50:38] you don't need to buy those things you
[50:39] simply need to pay money and they will
[50:41] give you an allotment of space Maybe 5
[50:43] GB or 10 GB on the cloud and then you
[50:46] will be able to store your data there so
[50:48] but we notice that Moses
[50:51] Moses before I mean like many many years
[50:54] ago he went to the clowd downloaded from
[50:57] the cloud the wisdom of God and he put
[51:00] He put it on tablets of
[51:03] stone the wisdom of God God is wise
[51:05] there is nothing that can bypass him and
[51:08] there is nothing there is nothing that
[51:09] we he needs to know to increase his
[51:11] knowledge or he knowing there is nothing
[51:14] that we need to add on him there is
[51:16] nothing that we can take away from him
[51:18] you know our existence does not improve
[51:20] him do you understand what what I'm
[51:22] saying our existence does not improve
[51:25] him and our exist our nonexistence does
[51:27] not does not reduce on who he is and
[51:30] what he is God is God and he is seeking
[51:34] for a people who will believe in him
[51:36] amen that's where I'm I'm headed I want
[51:38] us to see that when God gives his word
[51:40] he does not give his word subject for
[51:43] debate he does not give his word subject
[51:45] for you know for people to think or to
[51:47] doubt and then ask questions you know if
[51:49] you want to ask a question you should be
[51:51] asking a question to know his mind to
[51:54] know his will but not to question his
[51:56] will or to question his mind or to
[51:58] question what he has said to you and
[52:00] that's why Believers why are we called
[52:02] Believers we are called Believers
[52:03] because we are are the people that have
[52:06] decided to believe everything God has
[52:09] said whether we whether we understand it
[52:12] or not he never told us to understand it
[52:15] but he simply told us to do what to
[52:17] believe it so we are believers not
[52:19] because we understand everything in the
[52:21] Bible we are believers but because we
[52:24] believe everything in the Bible now now
[52:26] when someone reads you something and it
[52:28] you know it plays with your mind and you
[52:30] can't understand it and then he asks you
[52:32] do you also believe that say yes I
[52:34] believe it I believe it I believe
[52:37] everything as long as it is in the Bible
[52:38] I believe it because the word of God is
[52:40] the absolute and it's the absolute
[52:42] because it's the word of God and God's
[52:45] side is the word praise the name of the
[52:47] Lord now i' would like us also to take
[52:50] First Peter chapter 1:
[52:54] 13 uh we read verses um 13 to 19 listen
[52:59] he says where guard up your loyon the
[53:01] loons of your mind okay there is also
[53:04] something that I would want us to uh to
[53:07] zero in a little bit on on that on the
[53:09] mind he says guard up the loyons of your
[53:13] mind last time we talked about the mind
[53:15] and we found out that the mind is the
[53:19] spirit and the spirit you know man is
[53:22] Body Soul and Spirit now your body is
[53:25] the one on the outside your spirit next
[53:27] and then your soul your soul is the real
[53:30] you and now the mind is we we we looked
[53:34] at the gats of the mind and it has five
[53:36] gats conscious imaginations memory and
[53:39] others and he says guard up the loyons
[53:42] of your mind be sober and hope to the
[53:44] end of the grace that is to be brought
[53:46] unto you at the revelation of Jesus
[53:49] Christ as obedient children not
[53:51] fashioning yourselves according to the
[53:53] former LS of in your ignorance
[53:57] now before we knew God in other words
[53:58] before we knew God our mind was clouded
[54:01] with the things that were completely
[54:03] anti- good and anything anti- word is
[54:06] anti- God that means Antichrist now
[54:08] before we came to God before we came to
[54:10] him we had things in our mind we had
[54:13] things in our spirit but you see the
[54:14] Bible calls it our ignorance and I I'll
[54:18] explain many of those things just follow
[54:19] me here and he says so we had lust our
[54:22] former lust our initial lust the moment
[54:24] you were born you had certain lust
[54:26] within you because of your ignorance
[54:28] because your mind was not yet cleansed
[54:30] by the word of God but he says but as he
[54:33] which has called you is Holy so be ye
[54:37] holy in all manner of conversation and
[54:41] he says because it is written be you
[54:44] holy for I am Holy are you following me
[54:49] are you following me amen and if you if
[54:52] it says and if you call on the father
[54:54] who without respect of person judges
[54:57] according to Every Man's work pass the
[55:00] time of your souring here in fear for as
[55:03] much as you know that you were not
[55:06] redeemed with corruptible things as
[55:08] silver and gold from your VIN
[55:11] conversations received by tradition from
[55:14] your fathers but with the precious blood
[55:17] of Christ as of a lamb without blemish
[55:20] and without sport now here we need to
[55:23] understand that God is Holy and God is
[55:25] God now when when we approach him we
[55:27] should be ready and willing to submit to
[55:30] his
[55:32] will his will is revealed to us by his
[55:35] word I want to ask you a question why is
[55:38] it that our mind or our spirit our will
[55:40] is naturally against his word because
[55:42] many people come and you know I've
[55:43] talked to many people and they always
[55:44] tell me are you telling me that I should
[55:47] lose my mind that I should not use my
[55:49] brains that I should not use my spirit
[55:51] meaning my brains if someone says are
[55:53] you telling me that I should not use my
[55:54] brains to think that I should forget
[55:58] what my brain is telling me and then I I
[56:00] think what God is telling me to think
[56:02] listen your brain is your spirit are you
[56:05] following me well you need to say amen
[56:07] for me to say to to keep preaching to
[56:09] you or else I'll not
[56:10] preach your spirit your brain is your
[56:13] spirit and your spirit has a lot of
[56:18] things of course all of us were born
[56:20] with a spirit the moment you were born
[56:21] you had a spirit but your spirit had a
[56:24] lot of things that actually all most all
[56:26] the things in your spirit were against
[56:29] what is written here the moment you came
[56:31] to Christ you realized everything you
[56:33] have been preached to is against what
[56:35] you thought how many can relate
[56:37] everything they are preaching is against
[56:39] what you thought every and you're like
[56:40] what are they is this preure trying to
[56:43] say that I should leave what I know or
[56:45] what I think or what I've been taught to
[56:46] to to take something new yes but now
[56:50] listen our mind or our will is naturally
[56:54] against the word of God and for you to
[56:57] be able to receive a new or to receive
[57:00] or to to rather to be on the Lord's Side
[57:02] for you to be able to please God you
[57:04] need to do one thing you need to forsake
[57:07] your mind but how can you forsake your
[57:09] mind the Bible says you will receive a
[57:11] new heart and then you receive a new
[57:14] spirit when you you receive a new spirit
[57:16] then you have a new thinking then you
[57:19] have a new desire then you have a new
[57:21] thought then you have a new will then
[57:23] you have a new spirit so in other words
[57:25] the Bible says old Things become you
[57:27] know old Things become new the old is
[57:31] passed away now I want you to follow me
[57:33] here in Romans chapter 8 verse 7 tonight
[57:36] I'm teaching a concept of the word here
[57:38] and I'll show you the repercussion of
[57:40] those that do not follow this concept
[57:42] Romans 8:7 it says because the caral
[57:45] mind is enemity against God for it is
[57:49] not subject to the law of God neither
[57:51] indeed can be now I want you to imagine
[57:53] your mind to people who think it is not
[57:56] important to receive the Holy
[57:58] Spirit you have your mind and the Bible
[58:01] says your mind is caral now you don't
[58:05] need to do anything to have a caral mind
[58:07] all you need to do is to be born by your
[58:08] mother so all of us we are born with a
[58:11] caral mind but the Bible is telling us
[58:14] our caral mind is enemity against God
[58:18] our caral mind now remember your mind is
[58:20] your spirit now we are born with a mind
[58:23] that is against you know the the word of
[58:25] God for it is not subject to the law of
[58:27] God neither indeed can be now where is
[58:30] the law of God to the child of God the
[58:33] word of God is the law of God this is
[58:35] the law of God all of it in its entir
[58:38] not just one verse all of it Old
[58:40] Testament and New Testament this is the
[58:42] law of God now when we come to God and
[58:46] we we the word of God is preached
[58:48] naturally your kind of mind cannot
[58:50] receive this word that is why we have
[58:52] too many people in churches or even in
[58:54] the message who are believers but they
[58:58] have not received the life they have not
[59:01] received a new mind they have the other
[59:03] kind of mind many people who are called
[59:04] Christians but they do the same things
[59:06] that the people in the world do because
[59:08] they have never come to a place of of an
[59:11] experience with God to receive a new
[59:13] mind they still have the caral mind and
[59:16] with the caral mind you can never be
[59:18] subject to the law of God maybe what you
[59:20] will be is a hypocrite and do you know
[59:22] what who a hypocrite is a hypocrite is
[59:24] someone who claims to believe the word
[59:26] but does not actually practice it he has
[59:28] no power within him to practice the word
[59:30] he will still lie you will still tell
[59:32] lies you will still steal you will still
[59:34] fornicate you will still last after the
[59:36] things of the world even when you come
[59:38] to church you come to church and do the
[59:40] things of God and you go in the world
[59:41] and do the things of the world because
[59:42] you have a can of mind and the Bible
[59:45] says a can of mind is enemity against
[59:48] God and then it says in verse 6 uh this
[59:52] is a little bit up it says for to be
[59:54] kindly minded is death but to be
[59:58] spiritually minded is life and peace may
[1:00:02] God help me never to be kindly minded
[1:00:05] you know a can of man let me tell you I
[1:00:09] will show you here an example before we
[1:00:11] finish a can man will see things canally
[1:00:15] will see things what in what we call
[1:00:18] reality things that you see that
[1:00:20] everybody is seeing and everybody can
[1:00:22] see they even say even a child can see
[1:00:24] it why can't you see it but listen
[1:00:27] that's a can of Mind a a can of mind
[1:00:30] will see what everybody will see what
[1:00:31] every human being will see but the mind
[1:00:34] of God will see only what the word of
[1:00:36] God says regardless of what everybody
[1:00:38] else is
[1:00:40] seeing praise the name of the Lord verse
[1:00:43] 8 we're still in Romans chapter 8 so
[1:00:46] then they that are in the flesh cannot
[1:00:51] please God but ye are not in the flesh
[1:00:55] but in the the spirit if so be that the
[1:00:58] spirit of God dwell in you now if any
[1:01:00] man have not the spirit of Christ he is
[1:01:03] none of his when I read this I first
[1:01:06] paused a bit to understand it listen do
[1:01:09] you realize that the Bible actually is
[1:01:10] saying if you do not have the spirit of
[1:01:12] Jesus Christ you are not his
[1:01:15] child simple so now if you've never
[1:01:18] received the Holy Spirit you are he has
[1:01:21] rejected you he has denied you he has
[1:01:23] denounced you you remember the other
[1:01:24] scripture which says that many of them
[1:01:26] will come to me and they will say Lord
[1:01:27] Lord you know open for us you know we we
[1:01:30] did many things in your name we preached
[1:01:32] the gospel in your name we healed the
[1:01:34] sick in your name we we we raise the
[1:01:35] dead in your name he will not say you
[1:01:37] never did those things he actually
[1:01:39] admits yes you did those things in my
[1:01:41] name because his name has power anyone
[1:01:43] can take the name of Jesus and use it
[1:01:45] and he will receive results but here he
[1:01:48] says go away from me doers of iniquity
[1:01:50] now who is a doer of iniquity he says I
[1:01:53] never knew you
[1:01:56] how how do you get known by God or how
[1:01:59] does God know you God only knows you
[1:02:01] when you are in him and he's in you and
[1:02:04] he can only know you when his holy
[1:02:06] spirit is in your soul amen when you
[1:02:08] have been filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:02:09] then you can say you are known of God
[1:02:11] and is known of you you are known of God
[1:02:12] he knows you and you know him you are
[1:02:14] you are in him and he's in you that's
[1:02:16] the only way you can be known of God and
[1:02:18] the only way you can have the spirit of
[1:02:19] Jesus CHR in you but here he says if any
[1:02:22] man have not the spirit of Christ he is
[1:02:24] none of his and we have very many
[1:02:26] Believers without the spirit of Christ
[1:02:29] in them how do you know that you don't
[1:02:32] have the spirit of
[1:02:33] Christ is when to fulfill the law of God
[1:02:37] to you it is a
[1:02:39] struggle if it is a struggle for you to
[1:02:41] fulfill the law of God you do not have
[1:02:44] the Holy
[1:02:47] Spirit if it is a struggle for you to
[1:02:49] believe what the Bible says and practice
[1:02:51] it believing it is one thing but
[1:02:52] practicing it if it is a struggle for
[1:02:54] you to practice what is in the word of
[1:02:56] God then to you you don't have the Holy
[1:02:58] Spirit and how can you receive the Holy
[1:02:59] Spirit simply ask the Bible says ask and
[1:03:03] you shall receive if you ask believing
[1:03:05] then God will give you the Holy Spirit
[1:03:07] and when he gives you the Holy Spirit
[1:03:08] and to fulfill the word of God will not
[1:03:10] be a struggle it will be a natural thing
[1:03:12] it will come out of your spirit it will
[1:03:14] come out out of your soul it will be
[1:03:16] just you living your life in Romans 11
[1:03:19] verse 6 it says but without faith it is
[1:03:22] impossible to please him for he that
[1:03:24] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:03:28] and that he's a rewarder of them that
[1:03:30] diligently seek him so if you seek
[1:03:32] Him
[1:03:34] you uh he re he rewards you he gives you
[1:03:37] the Holy Spirit but without faith it is
[1:03:40] impossible to please God now I want us
[1:03:43] to differentiate two things here that is
[1:03:44] Faith and wisdom and these are the two
[1:03:48] things that are ruling the world today I
[1:03:50] don't know where you you which side you
[1:03:51] are on faith if you have faith you
[1:03:55] believe without seeing how many are how
[1:03:57] many how many believe in the
[1:03:59] Rapture you believe in the rupture can
[1:04:01] you prove
[1:04:03] it can you prove it can anyone prove the
[1:04:06] Rapture here you cannot prove the
[1:04:08] Rapture that is Faith how many Believers
[1:04:10] saved and are Washed by the blood of
[1:04:13] Jesus Christ that is Faith you cannot
[1:04:16] see it you can't even feel it you can't
[1:04:18] say that I feel like 100 kilogram of
[1:04:20] Salvation in my heart you don't feel it
[1:04:22] but you simply believe it you you you
[1:04:25] you you you you had and how do you
[1:04:26] receive Faith by hearing the word of God
[1:04:29] the law of God then you submit yourself
[1:04:30] under that word then you have faith so
[1:04:33] Faith you believe without seeing but in
[1:04:35] your heart you're convinced that that is
[1:04:37] the truth and nothing can tell you
[1:04:39] otherwise but wisdom you would have to
[1:04:41] prove it first you would have to be
[1:04:43] realistic everybody would have to first
[1:04:45] you would have to first show everybody
[1:04:47] and and prove to everybody or somebody
[1:04:49] to prove to you then you say oh then I
[1:04:51] accept it now we cannot please God if
[1:04:54] our mind is not submitted for Renewal we
[1:04:57] have to submit our mind or else we can
[1:04:59] never you know uh please God we are born
[1:05:03] with a kind of mind all of us here are
[1:05:04] born with a c mind so let God give us a
[1:05:07] brand new mind every one of us needs to
[1:05:09] receive a brand new mind Hallelujah a
[1:05:13] brand new mind a brand new mind a brand
[1:05:16] new mind our old mind represents or you
[1:05:19] know each time whenever the word of God
[1:05:21] is preached the the old mind the old
[1:05:24] Spirit resents the word I don't know
[1:05:26] about you but when I first came into the
[1:05:28] message and they would preach things I
[1:05:31] would sit back there and I would begin
[1:05:33] to resent it in my
[1:05:41] mind now when you are when you ever get
[1:05:44] at that place just to know you still
[1:05:45] have a can of mind and your can of mind
[1:05:48] is resenting the word but if you have a
[1:05:51] new mind whatever is preaching you say
[1:05:54] amen amen whether you believe it whether
[1:05:57] your mind accepts it or not you your
[1:05:59] heart will receive it whether you feel
[1:06:02] like it or not your heart will accept it
[1:06:04] whether you are listen even if your life
[1:06:06] is not yet living that word are you
[1:06:09] hearing me even if you are not able to
[1:06:11] live that word yet you are struggling
[1:06:13] but your body is not accepting your
[1:06:15] spirit is not accepting each time you
[1:06:17] keep you know falling short of it but
[1:06:19] you know what in your heart you just
[1:06:21] believe it as the word of God and
[1:06:22] whenever it is preached you just say
[1:06:24] amen and until one day you will realize
[1:06:26] you are able to live the life of that
[1:06:28] word in your
[1:06:29] life and we see that our old mind will
[1:06:32] always resent the word but the new mind
[1:06:35] will always receive the word amen you
[1:06:38] reach a moment when he his word
[1:06:40] overwhelms and possesses you I don't
[1:06:42] know how many have reached at that point
[1:06:43] in their life but I tell you what I have
[1:06:45] reached that point in my life whereby
[1:06:48] the word of God Amen has completely
[1:06:50] overwhelmed me and possessed me
[1:06:53] Hallelujah if you want to be my friend
[1:06:54] tell me things that in the word of God
[1:06:56] but if you want to Amen to go against
[1:06:58] this word hallelujah I will tell you I
[1:06:59] will make you my
[1:07:01] enemy because this word is my life this
[1:07:04] word is my everything this word has made
[1:07:06] me who I am this word is God and I
[1:07:08] believe it because I'm on God's
[1:07:11] side Hallelujah and whatever this word
[1:07:14] of God says then we should believe it
[1:07:16] because this word
[1:07:18] works you see you reach that moment when
[1:07:22] the word of God overwhelms you and that
[1:07:24] word of God possesses you you know that
[1:07:26] is the moment you believe every word
[1:07:28] every word it says and you know how do
[1:07:30] you believe it by Faith by Faith by
[1:07:33] faith you know by faith you come to
[1:07:35] church you came here today how by faith
[1:07:38] believing that you're going to receive
[1:07:39] something from the Lord hallelujah when
[1:07:42] you come to church you you you you may
[1:07:44] you may see you know oh there are only
[1:07:47] 20 people there only 30 people my faith
[1:07:49] is not on how many people came to church
[1:07:51] my faith is on me I have gone there I'm
[1:07:54] my my my past of and God is going to
[1:07:56] speak to me and therefore when the word
[1:07:58] of God Is Spoken I would say Amen Lord I
[1:08:01] believe it by faith we say Amen to the
[1:08:03] word of God by faith you pray amen by
[1:08:06] faith you go to Prayer by faith you know
[1:08:08] you go to work and you get a job and you
[1:08:10] go to work by faith you
[1:08:12] marry to those of you planning marriage
[1:08:14] and and working on marriage by faith you
[1:08:16] marry you see I want to show you
[1:08:18] something I want to show you a new realm
[1:08:20] of the children of God a caral mind will
[1:08:23] want to organize everything and make
[1:08:27] sure everything is in place and I mean
[1:08:30] everything realistically you have to
[1:08:32] make sure that you you have everything
[1:08:34] in place you have 20 million on the
[1:08:37] account for your wedding you you you you
[1:08:39] you you you have you know this and you
[1:08:41] have that you have a big house you have
[1:08:42] this you have that you have a car you
[1:08:44] have everything so you now say now I'm
[1:08:46] ready for marriage and that's how the
[1:08:47] world functions but the children of God
[1:08:50] don't function like that the children of
[1:08:52] God function by faith and the Bible says
[1:08:55] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:08:57] God so even you marry by what by
[1:09:00] faith amen you know even children I've
[1:09:04] seen even those who even H you know go
[1:09:06] to the next level of marriage and they
[1:09:08] say well I'm married now but I'm not
[1:09:10] ready to have children why because
[1:09:11] they're fearing H will I be able to take
[1:09:14] my children to school will I be able to
[1:09:16] feed them will I be able to pay you know
[1:09:19] this for that will I be able to buy Dias
[1:09:22] will I be able to do that will I be able
[1:09:23] to do this why because they have a can
[1:09:25] mind and the says a can mind is enity
[1:09:28] with
[1:09:29] God and let me tell you Saints amen we
[1:09:32] should always have the spiritual mind
[1:09:34] not the can of mind because a can of
[1:09:35] mind will never agree with the word of
[1:09:37] God but a spiritual mind will always be
[1:09:39] pliable will always believe in the
[1:09:41] Unseen will always believe in what God
[1:09:43] can do will always see what others are
[1:09:45] not seeing amen so when God gives you a
[1:09:48] wife you'll say well I'm going to have
[1:09:49] children and I'm going to have as many
[1:09:51] as the Lord will give
[1:09:53] me Hallelujah because he says the
[1:09:56] children are the heritage of the Lord
[1:10:00] and he says happy is a man whose quiver
[1:10:02] is full of them but do you know that has
[1:10:04] changed by the mar that has changed Even
[1:10:06] in our churches they say sad is the man
[1:10:09] whose quer is full of them
[1:10:11] sad when they ask you how many children
[1:10:13] you have me I now have five and I'm
[1:10:16] praying and believing for more if the
[1:10:18] Lord teres and by his grace but when I
[1:10:21] tell you I have five some of
[1:10:23] you you see because the way the world
[1:10:26] has done it the way the world has
[1:10:28] fashioned the whole thing it has made
[1:10:30] you have fear fear about the whole
[1:10:32] subject you see but you see when you
[1:10:35] tell the world today that you have five
[1:10:37] children everybody will be shocked
[1:10:39] everybody will say what ah within how
[1:10:42] long within no brother go slow you know
[1:10:44] this is very difficult what what what
[1:10:47] you are you happy are you I said yes the
[1:10:49] Bible says happy is a man whose quiver
[1:10:52] is full of them the Bible does not sad
[1:10:55] is the man whose quer is full of them so
[1:10:58] but the opposite is true sad is the man
[1:11:01] whose quiver is
[1:11:02] empty so if you are married and you're
[1:11:05] failing failing or fearing rather to
[1:11:07] have children then you are a sad
[1:11:10] person but you should be you should know
[1:11:13] that if if if if God God's word says
[1:11:16] happy is the man who keep is full of
[1:11:18] them you are going to have a spiritual
[1:11:19] mind not a kind of mind you're going to
[1:11:20] say Amen Lord amen Lord and you are the
[1:11:23] moment you Mar you're going to begin
[1:11:24] praying for children oh God give us
[1:11:26] children
[1:11:28] hallelujah oh brother Isaac you should
[1:11:30] cut out that and give it to the people
[1:11:32] who who just got married so they can
[1:11:33] hear it praise
[1:11:35] God Amen so by faith you have children
[1:11:38] by faith you give you don't give to say
[1:11:41] now let me give to get no you don't give
[1:11:43] to get but you give by faith believing
[1:11:46] that God will will will give you much
[1:11:48] more amen you give by faith amen
[1:11:51] whatever you give you give yourself by
[1:11:52] faith you give of your substance by

[1:12:28] do you do that how do you do that let me
[1:12:30] tell you it is all by
[1:12:32] Faith by faith Hallelujah you cannot
[1:12:35] please God if you're using your
[1:12:36] reasoning if you're using your wisdom
[1:12:39] you have to use Faith because Faith amen
[1:12:41] is the currency of Heaven Hallelujah we
[1:12:45] need men and women of Faith amen who
[1:12:47] will go and say I'm going to start a
[1:12:49] company
[1:12:50] H I am going to start a company now I
[1:12:53] will know you are on God's side
[1:12:55] Hallelujah yes brother you start a
[1:12:57] company sister you start it and watch it
[1:12:59] watch God come behind it and you know
[1:13:02] you know what God does our God watches
[1:13:05] and waits for people and men who have
[1:13:07] faith if you if you have nothing you
[1:13:10] cannot add on you anything but he says
[1:13:12] to him that has more shall be added so
[1:13:15] God Amen is pleased with men and women
[1:13:18] of Faith so if you have faith start

[1:14:15] tell your neighbor it's by
[1:14:17] faith you don't have to struggle about
[1:14:19] anything it is by faith and let me tell
[1:14:22] you the problem that we have with
[1:14:25] Christianity is many people do not have
[1:14:28] faith and even Abraham is called the
[1:14:31] father of uh of the faith because
[1:14:34] Abraham believed God and it was counted
[1:14:37] for unto him for righteousness so in
[1:14:39] other words if you have faith you
[1:14:41] potentially are righteous You Are Holy
[1:14:44] simply because you have faith can you
[1:14:45] imagine that simply because you have
[1:14:48] faith you are righteous it was counted
[1:14:50] unto him for righteousness because he
[1:14:52] had Faith he believed god without seeing
[1:14:55] without getting any
[1:14:58] shity I I i' would like to show you this
[1:15:01] example here in the Book of Numbers if
[1:15:03] you can open the Book of Numbers Chapter
[1:15:04] 3:
[1:15:07] 5 uh we begin from verse 5 yes it's a
[1:15:12] long story but we'll break break it as
[1:15:14] as we go along
[1:15:18] amen and the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:15:21] saying bring the tribe of Levi near
[1:15:26] uh brother Dixon if you can work on my
[1:15:28] monitor uh bring excuse me bring the
[1:15:31] tribe of Levi near and present them
[1:15:34] before Aaron the priest that they may
[1:15:37] Minister unto him and they shall keep
[1:15:39] his charge and the charge of the whole
[1:15:42] congregation before the Tabernacle of
[1:15:44] the congregation to do the service of
[1:15:46] the Tabernacle and they shall keep all
[1:15:49] the instruments of the Tabernacle of the
[1:15:52] congregation and the charge of the
[1:15:54] children of Israel
[1:15:55] to do the service of the Tabernacle and
[1:15:58] thou shalt give the Levites unto Aon and
[1:16:01] to his sons and they are holy given unto
[1:16:04] him out of the children of Israel and
[1:16:06] thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons
[1:16:09] and they shall wait on their priests
[1:16:11] office and the stranger that cometh now
[1:16:14] shall be put to death now I read this
[1:16:17] portion in the book of numbers because
[1:16:19] it is speaking on uh God's instruction
[1:16:22] to Moses about the priesthood Ood and
[1:16:26] specifically about what Aaron's
[1:16:27] responsibility would be because Aaron
[1:16:29] was supposed to be the high priest and
[1:16:31] then his sons would be also the uh the
[1:16:34] priests but then the other Tri the other
[1:16:36] members of the tribe of Levy would be
[1:16:38] Ministers of Aaron and so he set
[1:16:41] everything in order and so that's how it
[1:16:44] was and and this we can now say was the
[1:16:47] word of God like you see that this is
[1:16:49] our Bible this was now their Bible what
[1:16:51] they had to refer to but I want us to go
[1:16:54] in number chap 16 much later on and we
[1:16:57] see what happened in numbers 16
[1:17:04] verse1 now Kora the son of isah the son
[1:17:08] of Kath the son of Levi all right so now
[1:17:11] we are seeing here one of the sons of of
[1:17:13] of Levi who were not in the priesthood
[1:17:17] K and Daran and Abraham these were sons
[1:17:20] of reben and they rose up verse two and
[1:17:23] they rose up before Moses with certain
[1:17:26] of the children of Israel 250 princes of
[1:17:29] the assembly famous in the congregation
[1:17:31] men of renown and they gathered
[1:17:33] themselves together against Moses and
[1:17:35] against Aaron and said unto them ye take
[1:17:38] too much upon you seeing all the
[1:17:40] congregation Are Holy uhhuh every one of
[1:17:44] them and the Lord is among them wherefor
[1:17:47] then lift up ye yourselves above the
[1:17:48] congregation of the Lord now I want you
[1:17:50] to
[1:17:50] see there is a definition of God for
[1:17:53] holiness and there is a definition of
[1:17:56] man out of their his wisdom for Holiness
[1:17:59] now God had given his definition here
[1:18:01] even as we have already seen to be holy
[1:18:03] to be righteous to be accepted by the
[1:18:05] Lord is to be on his side and his side
[1:18:08] is his word the moment you believe his
[1:18:11] word how do you receive his word by what
[1:18:14] by faith you believe it you don't doubt
[1:18:16] you don't question it you just simply
[1:18:18] believe it now when you do that you are
[1:18:21] considered to be holy all right so now
[1:18:23] this man Abraham Daran and then Kora
[1:18:28] came to Moses and they said you are
[1:18:30] taking too much on you huh we are also
[1:18:33] holy all the Believers in the church Are
[1:18:34] Holy we are all holy every one of them
[1:18:37] is Holy why are you the one taking all
[1:18:39] these responsibilities you and Aaron why
[1:18:43] and Moses heard it he fell upon his face
[1:18:47] why did Moses do that Moses knew the
[1:18:49] mistake these people had done let me
[1:18:51] tell you brother sister do anything and
[1:18:54] everything but never doubt the word God
[1:18:57] is never pleased with doubters or people
[1:19:00] who play around with his word because
[1:19:02] his word is the absolute his word is the
[1:19:04] core of our heart of our souls without
[1:19:07] his word we we we are dead we have
[1:19:10] perished that's why in the in the
[1:19:12] message let me tell you in the there are
[1:19:13] some churches that just take this Bible
[1:19:17] lightly they're Christians but they do
[1:19:19] not value this Bible they take it
[1:19:22] lightly but let me tell you this Bible
[1:19:23] is not just a book like any other book
[1:19:26] this is the thoughts of God the mind of
[1:19:28] God is the
[1:19:30] absolute our life should be guided by
[1:19:33] the word of God and anyone who preaches
[1:19:35] anything that is not based on the Bible
[1:19:37] is only having fables Creeds and dogmas
[1:19:40] and those shall pass away but the Bible
[1:19:42] says Heaven and Earth shall pass away
[1:19:44] but what shall never pass away the word
[1:19:46] my word shall never pass away and that's
[1:19:49] why here we believe the word because we
[1:19:50] believe the word to be the absolute and
[1:19:52] we believe the word shall never pass
[1:19:55] away our churches will pass away our
[1:19:57] building will pass away people shall die
[1:20:00] but the word of God can never pass away
[1:20:02] and how do you know a preacher who's
[1:20:04] preaching the truth everything he's
[1:20:05] saying must be backed up by the word or
[1:20:08] else is only bringing his favors and his
[1:20:11] ideas and so we see here Moses knew the
[1:20:14] mistake these people had done the moment
[1:20:16] they began murmuring and questioning the
[1:20:20] word it is God I just read it for you
[1:20:23] there in in in in numbers chapter 3 it
[1:20:25] is God who said now you Moses you are
[1:20:29] God you Moses you are God uhuh and then
[1:20:32] he said now Aaron is going to be the
[1:20:34] high priest and his sons uhuh and now
[1:20:38] the the rest of the tribe of uh of the
[1:20:40] Levites those ones they shall be
[1:20:43] ministers to to
[1:20:46] Aaron they will be ministers in the in
[1:20:48] the Tabernacle to Aaron so that was the
[1:20:50] hierarchy that God said Moses a and and
[1:20:54] then come all the other Levites and the
[1:20:56] ministers and then come the
[1:20:58] congregation now K was among the people
[1:21:02] who were in The in from the tribe of
[1:21:05] realan they were just from the
[1:21:06] congregation and others so they now came
[1:21:09] they teamed up here is one from the
[1:21:11] tribe of Levy and one they now gathered
[1:21:13] themselves together and they came to
[1:21:15] fight against the hierarchy that God had
[1:21:18] set you see God had set Moses Aaron his
[1:21:23] sons and then then the rest of the tribe
[1:21:25] of Levy come after Minister but now
[1:21:29] these people saw Moses up there like God
[1:21:32] giving around Commandments and telling
[1:21:34] people to do this and this and then they
[1:21:36] saw Aaron there as a high priest
[1:21:39] everything is saying he saying he's
[1:21:41] doing it on behalf of God is's the only
[1:21:42] one who who enters the the holy of
[1:21:44] holies and now they I'm sure when they
[1:21:46] they they made they met together they
[1:21:48] must have begun reasoning but what is
[1:21:51] the difference between us and Moses and
[1:21:52] Aaron we are all the same we are all
[1:21:55] human beings we all have blood we are
[1:21:57] all called of God we all holy actually
[1:21:59] said we are all holy because we are all
[1:22:02] children of Israel why are they the only
[1:22:04] ones having these important
[1:22:07] responsibilities why are they not
[1:22:09] allowing us also to go and do this why
[1:22:11] are they also not allowing us to go and
[1:22:13] do that they no no no no this is not
[1:22:14] good it's not
[1:22:16] gender maybe also medium because
[1:22:18] remember also medium was part of it
[1:22:19] maybe it's not gender gender balance
[1:22:21] it's not equality it's not you know what
[1:22:23] is the other words that they use to
[1:22:24] always involve include
[1:22:32] others yeah diversity yeah this the
[1:22:35] leadership is not diverse it's not
[1:22:37] diverse they should put someone from our
[1:22:39] tribe they should put from also now
[1:22:42] also should put someone from the tribe
[1:22:44] of of Lev when I see in the leadership
[1:22:47] when I
[1:22:47] see Pastor is I don't know which his
[1:22:51] tribe he is Brother Martin his tribe on
[1:22:54] his tribe our tribe is not
[1:22:57] represented I'm sure they were right
[1:22:59] because when they saw Aon and Moses and
[1:23:01] others there was none from the tribe of
[1:23:03] Rin and they must have felt bad they
[1:23:05] must have felt like we want our tribe to
[1:23:07] be there and this is the problem we have
[1:23:09] in many many
[1:23:11] churches they do God and let me tell you
[1:23:14] no man can call a pastor or a preacher
[1:23:17] it is God who calls them and when God
[1:23:20] calls somebody God stands behind someone
[1:23:23] to prove that I'm with that person and
[1:23:25] if you fight that person you're not
[1:23:26] fighting that person but you're fighting
[1:23:28] God
[1:23:30] himself and you see this is the problem
[1:23:32] that people have always had from from
[1:23:35] time IM Memorial they have always fought
[1:23:37] god without realizing they fighting God
[1:23:39] the moment Moses heard what they said
[1:23:43] what Moses fell down flat he fell down
[1:23:46] and he covered his face and and when he
[1:23:49] covered his face this is what he began
[1:23:51] praying listen he said and and he spake
[1:23:55] unto
[1:23:56] Kor he fell upon his face he didn't even
[1:23:59] say these things looking at
[1:24:01] Kor he he K must have been the ring
[1:24:05] reader because K was from the tribe of
[1:24:06] Levy they must have got somebody from
[1:24:08] the tribe of Le and now you you are
[1:24:10] among the leaders let us you come and
[1:24:12] you support our cause yes yes let us go
[1:24:14] and and do the Ken mandano let's go and
[1:24:18] quaka and so now as they came he spake
[1:24:22] unto K and unto his company saying even
[1:24:25] tomorrow the Lord will show who are his
[1:24:29] and who is Holy and will cause him to
[1:24:31] come near unto him even him whom he has
[1:24:34] chosen will he cause to come near unto
[1:24:37] him praise the name of the Lord that's
[1:24:40] why you should never stand behind the
[1:24:42] pull pit until you are called by God and
[1:24:44] when you do let me tell you never fight
[1:24:46] your battles God will always fight your
[1:24:48] battles that's why you should never do
[1:24:51] anything before you are called by God
[1:24:53] Amen and when you do anything knowing I
[1:24:55] am in the will of God Amen the will of
[1:24:58] God is the word of God it is not written
[1:25:00] in here it is on the back side of the
[1:25:02] book how many I getting it the moment
[1:25:05] you know the will of God for your life
[1:25:07] it is the word of God and if anyone
[1:25:10] comes no matter where they're coming
[1:25:11] from no matter what Authority they have
[1:25:13] if they fight against that they are
[1:25:15] fighting against the very God who has
[1:25:17] revealed his will to
[1:25:19] you and here they began fighting Moses
[1:25:22] and and trying to do that and Moses said
[1:25:24] all right if you are a royal priesthood
[1:25:27] you will always be challenged hallelujah
[1:25:30] hallelujah amen in the same way Aon was
[1:25:34] a priesthood was a high priest but for
[1:25:37] us we don't even need to be born from
[1:25:39] the tribe of Levy or Levi to be high
[1:25:42] priests or to be
[1:25:43] priests yes sir you you didn't hear me
[1:25:46] did you hear me we don't need to be
[1:25:48] naturally born out of the tribe of Levi

[1:25:54] convenant of of blood which was shed on
[1:25:56] the cross the Bible says we have also
[1:25:58] been made priests so we are also priests
[1:26:02] with God hallelujah we are also priests
[1:26:06] amen and and and the moment you become
[1:26:08] priests let me tell you many people are
[1:26:10] going to feel that you are lifting
[1:26:12] yourself higher than them and they'll
[1:26:14] begin to fight you but let me tell you
[1:26:16] brother sister never fight your own
[1:26:19] battles are you hearing me never try to
[1:26:22] defend yourself me I have you know I
[1:26:24] have a a way I do things when people

[1:26:35] know I it's not my battle to fight it is
[1:26:37] God to fight that battle amen hallelujah

[1:29:24] satisfied God has made
[1:29:26] me for which for which cause both thou

[1:29:31] together against the Lord and what is
[1:29:33] Aon that he M against him Hallelujah did

[1:29:55] Lord when he comes against you because
[1:29:57] you are standing there because God has

[1:30:10] these things we will not we will have
[1:30:11] very few musicians uh who get offended
[1:30:14] when someone speaks something negative
[1:30:15] when someone speaks something negative
[1:30:17] about you when you're at your post of
[1:30:18] Duty simply say you are you don't know
[1:30:21] what you're doing you are fighting
[1:30:22] against God because you at your post of
[1:30:25] Duty if you're a deacon and someone says
[1:30:27] something you know negative about you
[1:30:28] stay right there and say you don't know
[1:30:30] what you're doing this office has the
[1:30:32] anointing of the
[1:30:33] lord we would have few quitters let me
[1:30:36] tell you don't quit your place remain in
[1:30:38] your place Hallelujah as long as God has
[1:30:40] called you as long as you're doing it by
[1:30:42] faith stay right there God will fight
[1:30:45] for you Hallelujah glory to
[1:30:49] God praise God and he said you're
[1:30:51] fighting against God and you don't even
[1:30:53] know it
[1:30:54] you see and who is Aon Aon is just a man
[1:30:57] you're mming against him he's just a man
[1:30:59] he's just there to fulfill the purpose
[1:31:00] of God so these men that God uses could
[1:31:03] be a pastor could be a deacon could be a
[1:31:06] music leader or Sunday school
[1:31:07] superintendent or whatever it is they're
[1:31:09] just men used by
[1:31:12] God and in verse 19 he says and K
[1:31:15] gathered all the congregation against
[1:31:17] them even when Moses preached his
[1:31:20] sermon I'm imagining such sermon that a
[1:31:22] pastor or a minister would preach when
[1:31:24] he has been hurt Moses preached his
[1:31:27] sermon and finished it and after he had
[1:31:29] he had finished
[1:31:30] it then the congregation you know it
[1:31:34] says Kora Kora did not desist from his
[1:31:38] action he went and gathered all the
[1:31:40] congregation unto the door of the
[1:31:41] Tabernacle of the congregation and the
[1:31:43] glory of the Lord appeared unto the all
[1:31:46] the congregation I love that that that
[1:31:49] sight you know God always comes down to
[1:31:52] defend his word
[1:31:54] hallelujah oh my I feel so good about
[1:31:57] this whenever amen God is his word is
[1:32:00] put to the test God always shows up
[1:32:02] that's why friend always let us remain
[1:32:04] within the word whatever you do let your
[1:32:06] conscience be clear let your mind be
[1:32:08] clear that I am standing right in the
[1:32:10] place where I am supposed to be if you
[1:32:12] are in the place where you are supposed
[1:32:13] to be God will fight for you and you
[1:32:15] will hold your
[1:32:19] peace see here numbers 16: 20 oh all
[1:32:24] right let us read from verse 20 and we
[1:32:25] go down and we see now when the Lord
[1:32:27] came down what happened and the Lord
[1:32:29] spake unto Moses and and unto Aaron
[1:32:32] saying separate yourselves from among
[1:32:35] this congregation uhhuh that I may
[1:32:37] consume them in a moment he was angry
[1:32:41] God was angry he wanted to consume
[1:32:45] everyone and kill all the
[1:32:47] Israelites those ones who did bad and
[1:32:50] those ones who did not do bad that's why
[1:32:51] it is very I'm not going to finish my
[1:32:53] sermon again but you see I wanted to go
[1:32:56] into the the part of Separation that's
[1:32:58] why we have to separate ourselves from
[1:33:00] unbelief when someone is not believing
[1:33:02] the cause that you are believing always
[1:33:04] distance yourself from them because if
[1:33:06] you do not when God comes down he will
[1:33:09] not you know jump you he will he will
[1:33:12] consume him and consume you at the same
[1:33:13] time that's why you have to be very
[1:33:15] distinct with unbelief God does not love
[1:33:17] unbelief when you believe the word of
[1:33:19] God do not listen to stories that of of
[1:33:21] unbelievers and do not entertain in it
[1:33:24] stay with your word and desist from you
[1:33:27] know making unions and communions with
[1:33:29] unbelievers we will see it right here
[1:33:31] when God came down he he only told Moses
[1:33:34] and Aaron his servants he said separate
[1:33:36] yourself let me consume all of them
[1:33:38] everybody but listen and they fell upon
[1:33:42] their faces and they said oh God the god
[1:33:45] of the spirits of All Flesh shall one
[1:33:47] man sin and will thou be RO with all the
[1:33:51] congregation the old church has not done
[1:33:53] this oh God
[1:33:54] you see the importance of a man of God
[1:33:57] of a pastor of a Preacher that's why the
[1:33:59] Bible says that give them respects
[1:34:02] that's why the Bible says that honor
[1:34:03] them as they that watch for your souls
[1:34:05] listen if it wasn't for Moses and Aaron
[1:34:07] God was going to kill all of
[1:34:11] them and I'm not only preaching to dvf
[1:34:13] I'm also preaching to evening light
[1:34:15] that's why it is very important for you
[1:34:17] to respect your pastor and look up to
[1:34:19] him and and and and because he's a man
[1:34:21] of God God has placed him there he has
[1:34:23] an anointing upon his office and as long
[1:34:26] as he is the man God will only respect
[1:34:28] him because he's in that
[1:34:31] place you see and and um and when Moses
[1:34:34] died God placed another one there you
[1:34:37] see and the anointing shifted to another
[1:34:39] man but as long as Moses and Aaron were
[1:34:41] alive the anointing were upon them and
[1:34:45] and and it yeah you know it was not
[1:34:47] that's why someone said Can someone
[1:34:49] tithe to an individual brother bam said
[1:34:51] yes it depends on who the individual is
[1:34:54] tithe is not for building the church or
[1:34:56] for for buying land of the church tithe
[1:34:58] is for the pastor to for for for for his
[1:35:00] cost and his expenses right did we
[1:35:03] believe that do we do we believe that
[1:35:04] here and he says yes you can tithe to a
[1:35:06] man but it depends on who the man is he
[1:35:08] has to be your pastor not just an
[1:35:10] evangelist traveling around here and
[1:35:11] there he has to be your pastor you know
[1:35:13] someone that is feeding you the word
[1:35:15] someone that you look up to to to to to
[1:35:18] uh um to watch for your soul and so we
[1:35:20] see here that now the the moment they do
[1:35:23] that that the God says I'm going to
[1:35:25] destroy everybody step aside that that
[1:35:27] moment you know they fell on their faces
[1:35:29] and they began shouting said oh God will
[1:35:31] everybody will one person sin and you
[1:35:33] kill everybody oh no and the Lord spake
[1:35:36] unto Moses saying Speak unto the
[1:35:38] congregation saying get you up up from
[1:35:41] about the Tabernacle of Kora Daran and
[1:35:44] Abram and Moses rose up and went unto
[1:35:46] Daran and Abram and the Elders of Israel
[1:35:49] followed him and he spake unto the
[1:35:51] congregation saying ah this is the part
[1:35:53] love and this is why I got my subject
[1:35:55] who is on the Lord's Side Hallelujah
[1:35:58] because right at this moment you know
[1:36:00] Moses came up you know he was so fast
[1:36:03] because he was so happy he was feeling
[1:36:05] for those Souls who were not part of the
[1:36:07] sin which was committed amen let me tell
[1:36:09] you A God Called preacher will always
[1:36:12] have a heart for
[1:36:14] Souls will not be out for the money of
[1:36:17] the people but will be out there for the
[1:36:18] souls of the people and you know the
[1:36:20] moment God told him now you can go and
[1:36:22] separate them he r quickly and he went
[1:36:24] with the Elders of the church and they
[1:36:26] quickly went there and Moses rose up and
[1:36:29] went to D and Kora and Abraham and the
[1:36:31] ERS followed him and he spake unto the
[1:36:35] congregation saying to the church depart
[1:36:38] I pray you from the tents of the wicked
[1:36:40] men and touch nothing of theirs lest ye
[1:36:43] be consumed in all their sins H
[1:36:46] Hallelujah and I'm speaking to the
[1:36:48] church tonight I have the same same
[1:36:50] message to you
[1:36:52] today amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:36:55] he says depart I pray you depart from
[1:36:57] the tents of the wicked men the tents of
[1:37:00] the wicked men maybe the wicked women as
[1:37:02] well depart from them and touch nothing
[1:37:05] of theirs L he be consumed in all their
[1:37:07] sins I believe that's the cry we have in
[1:37:09] our generation depart be ye separate
[1:37:12] depart from the Sinners depart from the
[1:37:14] doubters depart from men who have no
[1:37:16] faith depart from them or else you be
[1:37:19] consumed with
[1:37:21] them it was a heartfelt
[1:37:24] someone that day he preached like a
[1:37:26] dying man to a dying generation that
[1:37:28] moment so they got up from the
[1:37:30] Tabernacle of K and that and Abraham on
[1:37:32] every side and d and Abraham came out
[1:37:34] and stood on the door of the of their
[1:37:36] tents and their wives and their sons and
[1:37:38] their little children and Moses said
[1:37:40] hereby ye shall know that the Lord has
[1:37:43] sent me to do all these works for I have
[1:37:46] not done them of my own accord my own
[1:37:49] mind you see it's not the mind of a man
[1:37:52] or a preacher it's the mind of of
[1:37:54] Christ if these men die the common death
[1:37:57] of all men or if they be visited after
[1:38:00] their the visitation of all men then the
[1:38:02] Lord has not sent me but if the Lord
[1:38:04] make a new thing and the Lord open her
[1:38:07] mouth and swallow them the Earth open
[1:38:10] her mouth and swallow them up with all
[1:38:13] that appertain unto them and they go
[1:38:17] down quick into the pit then ye shall
[1:38:20] understand that these men have provoked
[1:38:22] the Lord and it came to pass as he had
[1:38:24] made an end of speaking of all these
[1:38:26] words that the ground cave a that was
[1:38:30] under
[1:38:31] them and the Earth opened her mouth and
[1:38:35] swallowed them up and their houses and
[1:38:37] all the men that appertain unto cor and
[1:38:40] all their goods hey my God my God
[1:38:44] everything they had they and all that
[1:38:47] are pertained to them you
[1:38:52] see
[1:39:22] Hallelujah I'm one of them I'm one of
[1:39:24] them I'm so glad I can say I'm one of
[1:39:26] them not everybody in church wants to go
[1:39:28] to heaven others have their own you know
[1:39:31] ideas and ideologies and plans and
[1:39:33] things and that's why they will not fear
[1:39:34] to speak about certain things that don't
[1:39:36] even pertain unto them but when God came
[1:39:39] down he did not separate that these are
[1:39:42] young children this is just an innocent
[1:39:44] house this is an innocent friend he
[1:39:47] boundled everything together as long as
[1:39:49] they were together he said all of you
[1:39:50] you are going to be destroyed go out
[1:39:54] the
[1:39:55] earth the earth opened up oh my god when
[1:39:58] the earth opened up you needed to see it
[1:40:00] when the earth opened up everything all
[1:40:03] their goods all the men all the girls
[1:40:06] all the women everybody who was among
[1:40:09] the camp of K D abam the Earth opened up
[1:40:13] and swallowed
[1:40:16] everything they and all that pertained
[1:40:18] to them went down alive
[1:40:20] alive into the pit and the Earth closed
[1:40:24] upon them and they perished from among
[1:40:26] the congregation
[1:40:29] H there were two sides one side was
[1:40:33] separated unto the Lord it was on the
[1:40:35] Lord's Side Moses Aaron and others and
[1:40:37] then the other side was the side of
[1:40:40] Abraham danan and Kora and everybody
[1:40:42] that believed in them when when when God
[1:40:45] wanted to destroy everybody God told
[1:40:47] them Moses said no please you can't do
[1:40:49] that there are others who are innocent
[1:40:51] he said all right I'll listen to you
[1:40:52] because you are my man all right now
[1:40:53] tell me who is innocent just go and and
[1:40:55] speak to them whoever will listen to you
[1:40:57] that's why you should listen to The
[1:40:58] Preacher's voice this a sound of many
[1:41:01] Waters the preachers voice the god that
[1:41:03] man that God sends and anoints to preach
[1:41:04] to you the word of God is a sound of
[1:41:06] many Waters and do not undervalue it
[1:41:08] it's the word of God for Save salvation
[1:41:11] of your souls and when they heard him
[1:41:13] they quickly ran on the other side and
[1:41:16] so tonight I also ask who is on the
[1:41:18] Lord's Side if you're on the Lord's Side
[1:41:20] you're going to abide by his word if
[1:41:22] you're on the Lord you're going to
[1:41:23] believe everything that is in his word
[1:41:26] you will not listen to the doubters you
[1:41:28] not listen to any other you know people
[1:41:30] just giving questions but you will
[1:41:32] listen to the word because the word to
[1:41:34] you will be life the others who refuse
[1:41:36] it what did they get they got death amen
[1:41:39] but the others who accept it they got
[1:41:42] life when others will come to you and
[1:41:45] they will say to you it is not it is not
[1:41:47] it is very difficult to live a Christian
[1:41:48] Life it is very difficult to do what the
[1:41:50] pastor is saying it is very difficult
[1:41:52] okay don't worry you remain there but if
[1:41:55] you among those who are on the Lord's
[1:41:58] Side you are not going to listen to that
[1:41:59] stuff you're going to run away from such
[1:42:01] people who speak such stuff and you will
[1:42:02] go on the Lord side immediately because
[1:42:04] we see that that's why the message of
[1:42:07] Separation also comes in here I'll
[1:42:09] finish with this quotes in the message
[1:42:11] the faith of
[1:42:12] Abraham he says when you come in and
[1:42:14] receive the Holy Ghost you say well I
[1:42:16] was told to be this and I was told the
[1:42:19] days of Miracles is passed you better
[1:42:21] leave that thing behind in other words
[1:42:24] whatever oh my somebody listening to me
[1:42:26] tonight whatever you were taught before
[1:42:28] you came to the knowledge of the word
[1:42:30] whatever thing you read maybe in a book
[1:42:32] whatever thing maybe you saw on a movie
[1:42:34] Whatever thing maybe you heard from your
[1:42:36] lecturer or from your teacher that is
[1:42:37] contrary to the word leave it
[1:42:41] behind he says leave that thing behind
[1:42:44] and as long as that holds with you it
[1:42:47] would be like Abraham started out with
[1:42:49] lot and his father there is trouble in
[1:42:51] the camp and God never did bless Abraham
[1:42:55] until he separated himself and done what
[1:42:57] God told him to do and you will never
[1:43:00] receive the holy ghost in the fullness
[1:43:03] you will never walk in the spirit of God
[1:43:06] until you totally separate your things
[1:43:10] from unbelief we ought to say Amen to
[1:43:13] that get away from the world come out of
[1:43:16] the world you see we have to totally
[1:43:19] separate from unbelief those men who did
[1:43:22] not separate themselves maybe they
[1:43:24] thought the argument of D and K and and
[1:43:28] Abraham is right is founded is
[1:43:32] psychologically and emotionally and
[1:43:34] whatever correct but it was wrong
[1:43:38] according to the
[1:43:43] word in the message Jehovah J I'll
[1:43:45] finish with that quote he says another
[1:43:47] thing he told him to do to separate
[1:43:49] himself now from his Kindred and all of
[1:43:51] his people he's talking about Abraham
[1:43:54] God in order to get a man or a woman boy
[1:43:56] or girl to obey him you have to separate
[1:44:00] yourself from all
[1:44:02] unbelief that's right until you totally
[1:44:06] separate yourself from anything contrary
[1:44:08] to that
[1:44:09] word and believe it God calls for a
[1:44:14] total separation tell somebody total
[1:44:17] separation total separation total
[1:44:21] separation who knew knew that that
[1:44:25] ground was going to open up and
[1:44:28] everybody that did not separate
[1:44:29] themselves would die who
[1:44:31] knew it was God's
[1:44:34] secret but you see if you don't separate
[1:44:37] yourself from the world you will die for
[1:44:40] sure but if you on the Lord's Side you
[1:44:43] will live for sure I want to be on the
[1:44:45] Lord's Side and I ask who is on the
[1:44:46] Lord's Side
[1:44:47] tonight let us stand up on our
[1:44:52] feet
[1:45:04] father in the name of Jesus we are
[1:45:05] praying Lord for the people that have
[1:45:07] had this message from the
[1:45:10] beginning and maybe some of them had
[1:45:12] made wrong decisions and had not
[1:45:14] separated themselves from
[1:45:18] unbelief and they were at a
[1:45:21] place when they did not exactly
[1:45:25] know what Association they should
[1:45:28] have but my prayer Lord for each one
[1:45:30] tonight is that you will meet them at
[1:45:32] their point of need and help them Father
[1:45:34] because death will surely come if they
[1:45:36] do not separate
[1:45:38] themselves father Lord we want to live
[1:45:42] in the way that you want us to live
[1:45:43] because we know that our time here on
[1:45:45] Earth is soon ending and will soon end
