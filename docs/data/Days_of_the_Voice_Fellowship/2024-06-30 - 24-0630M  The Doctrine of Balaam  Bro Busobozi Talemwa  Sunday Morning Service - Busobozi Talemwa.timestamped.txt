[1:38:05] you are in the
[1:38:06] valley but the god of the of the
[1:38:09] mountain the god of the V and we as
[1:38:12] Believers should always learn
[1:38:14] that and accept him and believe him and
[1:38:19] love him and serve him no matter which
[1:38:21] situation we are in
[1:38:24] praise the Lord amen if the deacons will
[1:38:27] want to help there I have some other
[1:38:28] like three or four seats here so maybe I
[1:38:31] see some people are struggling because
[1:38:32] of the pillars they can't see properly
[1:38:33] you can talk to them if they want to
[1:38:36] change
[1:38:36] [Music]
[1:38:39] their so this
[1:38:41] morning I just want to speak on the on
[1:38:44] the doctrine of
[1:38:47] balam and I was saying that there are
[1:38:48] many things that God can um you know be
[1:38:52] patient with
[1:38:56] um there are many things he can I don't
[1:38:58] wouldn't say compromise but I can say
[1:38:59] can be
[1:39:01] patient and um you know you can be a
[1:39:04] believer and going struggling this and
[1:39:07] that one thing that God is not
[1:39:10] patient fornication adultery
[1:39:15] immorality in fact I talked about it one
[1:39:18] time and I F forication
[1:39:24] and so and I showed you by
[1:39:28] the how fornication is very
[1:39:31] dangerous both physically and
[1:39:34] spiritually and how fornication can
[1:39:36] actually make you miss the
[1:39:40] Rapture and how fornication can
[1:39:43] actually cause you to be
[1:39:45] disfellowshipped from the
[1:39:47] fellow is the only thing that I know of
[1:39:50] that can actually make you be this
[1:39:52] Fellowship
[1:39:56] that is if you continue walking in that
[1:39:59] life having been
[1:40:01] corrected but you resist
[1:40:04] correction is the thing that I know that
[1:40:06] God
[1:40:08] HS is almost
[1:40:10] impossible for someone to be spiritually
[1:40:16] fine if they are physically working in
[1:40:21] immorality and it is Al impossible if
[1:40:24] somebody is working physically in
[1:40:28] immorality to be spiritually
[1:40:31] fine the physical types the
[1:40:34] spiritual what do you see in the
[1:40:36] physical in someone's
[1:40:38] life it shows what they are in the
[1:40:43] spiritual praise the name of the Lord
[1:40:46] and so we see the doctrine of
[1:40:49] balam balam is one man that we will we
[1:40:52] have a lot to read and
[1:40:53] a lot to
[1:40:56] cover but here he says I have a few
[1:40:59] things against you speaking to the
[1:41:01] Saints in um in in
[1:41:07] pamos because you have them there that
[1:41:10] hold the doctrine of
[1:41:13] balam so God was not happy with the
[1:41:16] church age of
[1:41:19] P because they had those people who had
[1:41:22] a doctrinal balance
[1:41:26] and he says balam taught balac how to
[1:41:28] cast a stumbling block before the
[1:41:30] children of
[1:41:35] Israel he also told them to eat things
[1:41:38] sacrificed to
[1:41:43] idols and also he told them to commit
[1:41:47] fornication we we we will not because of
[1:41:51] time read there but you can actually
[1:41:52] have time later on and read in the Book
[1:41:54] of
[1:41:56] Numbers chapter
[1:41:58] 22 23
[1:42:01] 24 25 in these chapters in
[1:42:05] numbers he shows everything that bam
[1:42:09] did but I'll just go a little ahead of
[1:42:12] myself and tell you
[1:42:14] thisam tried
[1:42:17] everything to bring down the Church of
[1:42:20] the Church of Israel
[1:42:23] he could not
[1:42:25] Prevail he could not cast it he could
[1:42:28] not bring it down but the only
[1:42:31] thing that he used to bring it
[1:42:34] down was
[1:42:36] fornication was
[1:42:38] immorality and I'd like us to get into
[1:42:41] the doctr of balam today and
[1:42:44] see hoping that we shall learn a lot of
[1:42:46] things this
[1:42:47] morning so this may not be your kind of
[1:42:50] service where you are shouting and very
[1:42:51] happy but you you will learn a lot
[1:42:56] but every believer anywhere every word
[1:42:58] of God will make you
[1:43:02] shout brother I'm going to begin with a
[1:43:04] resume of
[1:43:08] Ages I believe every believer of the end
[1:43:11] time message should at least read the
[1:43:12] church age book and finish
[1:43:17] it I remember in we read it with the
[1:43:20] young
[1:43:22] people and went through it almost almost
[1:43:25] line by line word by
[1:43:28] word it was a very big
[1:43:31] blessing and so he says here now watch
[1:43:34] this doctrine of balam most
[1:43:37] carefully notice above all that it is
[1:43:41] the deliberate maneuver of a corrupt
[1:43:49] clery the clergy or the preachers who
[1:43:52] are corrupt
[1:43:53] [Music]
[1:43:58] to bind the people to
[1:44:02] them by Leading the People deliberately
[1:44:05] into the scene of
[1:44:09] unbelief before I continue I will tell
[1:44:12] you right here one ways we Believers of
[1:44:15] the message are very different from the
[1:44:17] other
[1:44:19] denominations is that in the message we
[1:44:22] do noty B people to ourselves as
[1:44:26] preachers no we bind people to the
[1:44:30] word you know you are not my people you
[1:44:33] are the people of God but in the
[1:44:37] denominations the people will be the
[1:44:39] pastors
[1:44:40] people when the man of God says anything
[1:44:42] you just have to
[1:44:45] B as long as the
[1:44:49] man as long as the word of God did not
[1:44:52] say
[1:44:54] no matter who says it it doesn't
[1:44:58] matter the nicolan doctrine was the
[1:45:01] corruption of the clergy as they sought
[1:45:04] political power amongst
[1:45:12] themselves while bism you know they were
[1:45:16] they were seeking for political
[1:45:20] power while Bamm
[1:45:25] the subjection of the people to their
[1:45:27] system of creed and
[1:45:34] worship in order to hold to
[1:45:39] them now watch this carefully what was
[1:45:43] it that bound the people to the nominal
[1:45:45] church and thereby destroyed
[1:45:50] them it was the Creeds and
[1:45:55] dogmas formed in their Church
[1:45:59] tenants it was the doctrine of of the
[1:46:02] Roman Catholic
[1:46:05] Church many of you were from those
[1:46:08] denominations whereby you know you were
[1:46:10] subjected to a set of
[1:46:13] doctrines you know so that they can bind
[1:46:16] you to that
[1:46:19] denomination they ask you what is your
[1:46:21] religion then you say well I'm a
[1:46:24] Protestant I an angc I am a Muslim I am
[1:46:28] you know a Baptist and you are bound to
[1:46:32] them some of them like the
[1:46:35] Adventists they even make you sign
[1:46:39] somewhere the moment they baptize you in
[1:46:41] their
[1:46:42] Church they make you sign
[1:46:46] somewhere you
[1:46:47] know their baptism is that what baptizes
[1:46:50] you into their denomination
[1:46:54] and so you are now their slave
[1:46:57] forever but this end time message came
[1:46:59] to set us free from
[1:47:03] all because that is the doctrine of the
[1:47:07] niol listen carefully
[1:47:10] now they were not given the True Food
[1:47:13] the
[1:47:15] word they were given the food that came
[1:47:18] from idol
[1:47:21] worship Babylonian paganism wrapped up
[1:47:24] in Christian
[1:47:26] [Music]
[1:47:29] terminology and they and and that very
[1:47:32] same spirit and Doctrine is Right
[1:47:34] amongst all Protestants and it is called
[1:47:44] denomination you find them doing certain
[1:47:47] things teaching certain
[1:47:50] doctrines having certain mannerism
[1:47:53] [Music]
[1:47:55] and and ways of
[1:47:57] behavor but when you search the
[1:48:00] scripture you don't find it
[1:48:03] nowhere and now the prophet here tells
[1:48:05] you you find that in all the Roman
[1:48:09] Catholic protest
[1:48:11] denomination and he says that spirit is
[1:48:14] called
[1:48:17] denomination and we Believers of this
[1:48:20] message are not a denomination
[1:48:26] nanism is
[1:48:29] organization humanizing the leadership
[1:48:32] of the
[1:48:51] church
[1:49:21] e e
[1:50:19] the leadership of the home
[1:50:23] Christ is supposed to be the
[1:50:25] head and and the head is the word the
[1:50:28] holy
[1:50:28] spirit so whereby you are leading your
[1:50:31] family by the
[1:50:33] word so you find that that same spirit
[1:50:36] in
[1:50:38] churches even some message
[1:50:40] churches whereby people will obey their
[1:50:43] pastor and their Bishop more than they
[1:50:47] were some of them will even go to to an
[1:50:50] extent of saying if you're not in
[1:50:53] group you are doomed
[1:50:55] forever because we are the ones who have
[1:50:58] the
[1:50:59] truth and ask them why is it you they
[1:51:02] will say because our man is the one that
[1:51:05] God
[1:51:07] sent let me tell you the message has
[1:51:10] taken us Beyond
[1:51:13] man the message has brought us to a
[1:51:17] place where it is no longer a humanized
[1:51:21] leadership is the Holy Ghost
[1:51:24] leadership we are not led by man we are
[1:51:28] led by the spirit we are led by the word
[1:51:32] but the spirit of
[1:51:33] NIS will always be disposing the
[1:51:37] spirit people just do what Their pastor
[1:51:41] wants listen to me I don't care what I
[1:51:44] want don't follow what I want follow
[1:51:47] what the word
[1:51:49] say follow what the Holy Ghost to do
[1:51:53] amen if a man is a man of
[1:51:55] God he will be
[1:51:57] sensitive to the leadership of the Holy
[1:52:01] Spirit from him and from the
[1:52:04] people bism is
[1:52:09] denominationalism which takes the church
[1:52:11] manual instead of the
[1:52:18] Bible everybody
[1:52:25] ismism it takes the church
[1:52:30] man this is what we
[1:52:33] believe we believe a
[1:52:37] d and that's all we believe if you bring
[1:52:40] some
[1:52:43] more they will tell you you have a false
[1:52:47] Doctrine I don't know some of you if you
[1:52:49] have ever gone to these churches
[1:52:53] you say something new that they don't
[1:52:56] know they don't care whether it is here
[1:52:58] or not all they care about is we don't
[1:53:01] know it here in our
[1:53:04] CH but in the message we have the
[1:53:06] anointing of a flying
[1:53:09] eagle amen hallelujah I've preached to
[1:53:12] you for three years
[1:53:14] here but there are more things I've
[1:53:16] never preached in
[1:53:20] the not that you shall have preachers
[1:53:22] who will come here and prach things
[1:53:25] which I've never
[1:53:27] preached and I don't think there is one
[1:53:29] single message
[1:53:31] preacher has preached
[1:53:34] everything I don't think there is they
[1:53:37] have not preached
[1:53:38] everything because there is more in
[1:53:41] God there is always more they they made
[1:53:45] themselves
[1:53:46] Catholic they said we believe this this
[1:53:48] this
[1:53:49] this we We Believe this this this
[1:53:53] this we are Pentecostal we believe
[1:53:57] this and you find some even message
[1:54:00] Believers making groups among themselves
[1:54:03] we believe this but let me tell you what
[1:54:06] makes us not to be a
[1:54:08] denomination is that we do not have an
[1:54:11] end to what we
[1:54:13] believe do you know why because we
[1:54:16] believe in
[1:54:18] God Amen and God you can never finish it
[1:54:23] there is more in God there is more in
[1:54:25] God Amen just keep digging keep digging
[1:54:29] into the word every day you will find
[1:54:31] there is
[1:54:33] more there is
[1:54:35] more you can never finish it hallelujah
[1:54:39] amen oh my there is more in God that's
[1:54:43] why even in one single
[1:54:45] service the more you say Amen the more
[1:54:49] God releases himself the more you say
[1:54:52] Amen
[1:54:53] the god
[1:54:54] releases preachers will agree with me
[1:54:58] sometimes you go in a place people are
[1:55:00] so D they are not receiving the
[1:55:04] word and you'll preach as someone and
[1:55:07] get closed
[1:55:08] down you go somewhere else people are
[1:55:12] receiving you preach the same suon and
[1:55:15] things will
[1:55:16] happen What is the difference amen it's
[1:55:20] the people that are drawing from
[1:55:24] God it's like if I give you a
[1:55:27] drink with a straw on it and I ask and I
[1:55:31] tell you
[1:55:32] pull pull and you just put your mouth
[1:55:36] and pull once and say this is enough
[1:55:40] there is no more well you will go
[1:55:43] thirsty but if you keep pulling if you
[1:55:46] keep pulling you can never finish what
[1:55:49] is
[1:55:50] inside amen is the well of
[1:55:53] water that never runs
[1:55:56] dry amen is's a River of Life
[1:56:01] Hallelujah that's why we say amen that's
[1:56:05] why we Rejoice at the because we are
[1:56:07] pulling on
[1:56:09] the how many to pull
[1:56:12] on Amen we don't we don't have a church
[1:56:15] manual
[1:56:16] here we do not have a church
[1:56:20] manual We are following every in the
[1:56:23] Bible everything we know everything
[1:56:27] we've been
[1:56:28] told whatever more God will
[1:56:32] reveal Hallelujah and right to this
[1:56:36] hour many of God's people are C in the
[1:56:39] snare of
[1:56:43] denominationalism and God is crying to
[1:56:46] them come out of her my people that you
[1:56:50] be not partakers of our sins
[1:56:53] and that he receive not her
[1:56:57] plagues you see they are
[1:56:59] ignorant but if the Rapture should take
[1:57:02] place at this
[1:57:03] moment ignorance would be no court of
[1:57:06] appeal from the Judgment of God for
[1:57:08] being in the wrong
[1:57:15] run I didn't know Lord I was in my
[1:57:20] religion I believe told me I didn't know
[1:57:24] let me tell you brother you want said
[1:57:27] that we have been given a message
[1:57:30] comfort zone we leave our comfort zones
[1:57:33] we read the message we listen to the
[1:57:36] message we listen we eat we pull we Lear
[1:57:42] we
[1:57:43] grow when learning comes when the comes
[1:57:47] you will not say I did not
[1:57:49] know I I mean I was just I was just a
[1:57:52] good
[1:57:53] believer being a good believer will not
[1:57:56] take in the
[1:57:57] Rapture amen you need to pull
[1:58:02] El you need to pull on him so that you
[1:58:06] can receive
[1:58:07] strength for the to organize
[1:58:12] themselves with one rank over
[1:58:16] another this one is a pastor this one is
[1:58:19] a bishop this one is
[1:58:23] this is General
[1:58:25] overseer and the other one is Chief
[1:58:29] superintendent and the other one is the
[1:58:32] president and the other one is
[1:58:35] whatever they give themselves one rank
[1:58:37] over
[1:58:39] another until they are finally headed by
[1:58:43] a president is and this is a
[1:58:45] manifestation of the Antichrist
[1:58:54] regardless of how wonderful and
[1:58:56] necessary it may
[1:58:59] seem let me tell you friends all
[1:59:03] Ministers of this precious
[1:59:06] message are the
[1:59:09] same God uses them
[1:59:12] different because God is a god of
[1:59:15] variety there is no one single Pastor or
[1:59:19] Minister there is above another
[1:59:22] some of you love me so
[1:59:24] much until you think I'm the best that
[1:59:27] is but I've always told you I'm one
[1:59:30] little on the
[1:59:31] [Music]
[1:59:34] beach God can to do away with me so his
[1:59:38] other
[1:59:39] minister but all of them are important
[1:59:41] in the hands
[1:59:43] of and so there is no one who has a rank
[1:59:48] above we are told to H elders
[1:59:53] that doesn't mean that they have a rank
[1:59:58] higher are you following me Church you
[2:00:01] know they all continue you know ranking
[2:00:04] and ranking until you have a
[2:00:08] president that is a presiding officer
[2:00:12] soal but let me tell you our presiding
[2:00:15] offic is Jesus
[2:00:19] Christ Hallelujah it is not nothing but
[2:00:22] human reasoning taking the place of the
[2:00:25] [Music]
[2:00:28] word and any person who is in the
[2:00:31] organized
[2:00:34] denomination is right in the midst of an
[2:00:37] antichrist
[2:00:41] system now let me say this and make it
[2:00:45] very plain I am not against the
[2:00:49] people I am against the system
[2:00:53] am when we talk about these things we
[2:00:57] are not talking about the people in
[2:00:58] those
[2:00:59] churches we talking about the
[2:01:03] system praise the name of the Lord and
[2:01:06] so we shall go um in another portion
[2:01:09] brother brother Marvin now in the P
[2:01:12] Church
[2:01:14] age and it begins by quoting Revelation
[2:01:18] 214 thou Hast there them that hold a
[2:01:21] doct of
[2:01:25] balam who told balac to cast a stumbling
[2:01:27] block before the children of
[2:01:32] Israel to eat things sacrificed unto
[2:01:37] idols and to commit
[2:01:39] fornication and he says now you just
[2:01:41] can't have a nicolan set up in the
[2:01:44] church and not have the other
[2:01:48] [Music]
[2:01:54] you see if you take away the word of
[2:01:57] God and the moving of the
[2:02:00] spirit as a means of
[2:02:03] worship then you will have to give
[2:02:06] people another form of worship as a
[2:02:13] substitute and substitution spells bism
[2:02:22] God has set up his
[2:02:23] church on the day of
[2:02:26] Pentecost and he called it you know it
[2:02:28] was the church at
[2:02:30] Pentecost listen church and that church
[2:02:34] had two things that God was
[2:02:38] using to lead that
[2:02:40] church the first was the
[2:02:43] word they had the pure
[2:02:45] word they told today we have it here
[2:02:49] today the word the second
[2:02:52] was the
[2:02:53] spirit how many remember the holy ghost
[2:02:55] coming down on
[2:02:58] the only a
[2:03:01] few only a few
[2:03:03] remember right the Holy Ghost came down
[2:03:07] the Bible says they were all praying
[2:03:09] they were all waiting upon God and on
[2:03:11] that day they had a sound as a sound of
[2:03:16] a rushing mighty
[2:03:23] And
[2:03:24] Then There came pillars of
[2:03:27] fire a pillar of fire listen closely CH
[2:03:32] and this Pillar of
[2:03:34] Fire divided
[2:03:36] itself in different
[2:03:42] leaks leaks of
[2:03:44] fire and each leak of
[2:03:47] fire rested upon one
[2:03:49] person upon one person for one person
[2:03:53] how did they it make them
[2:03:56] feel now we've had people who
[2:03:59] say that we don't need
[2:04:01] emotion because the holy spirit is not
[2:04:04] emotional I agree with them in part that
[2:04:09] the Holy Ghost is not
[2:04:11] emotion because you can actually have
[2:04:14] emotion when it has nothing to do with
[2:04:16] the Holy
[2:04:16] Spirit many of you have been emotional
[2:04:19] this
[2:04:20] week maybe someone someone gave you
[2:04:22] money and you were so
[2:04:24] emotional or maybe someone you know did
[2:04:26] something for you and you so
[2:04:28] happy others just cry you know we
[2:04:31] emotional in different
[2:04:33] ways you find some someone just cries
[2:04:36] without saying a
[2:04:37] word when they've been
[2:04:41] overwhelmed you just
[2:04:43] tears another one they just
[2:04:49] shout just because they happy
[2:04:52] and others they just fall down pass out
[2:04:57] simply because they happy you know there
[2:05:00] are different ways depending on how God
[2:05:02] made you we are all not the
[2:05:06] same that not so Brethren so now in the
[2:05:09] same way when the Holy Ghost comes upon
[2:05:13] you you know he will have it is is not
[2:05:18] emotion but he will have an emotional
[2:05:20] experience
[2:05:24] and I I put it this way that the Holy
[2:05:26] Ghost is not
[2:05:27] emotional but he is
[2:05:31] emotional are you hearing me if I give
[2:05:34] you money do I have money
[2:05:36] here I don't know who is now thinking
[2:05:39] I'm going to give them

[2:05:50] real by the way
[2:05:53] I'm not going to take it

[2:05:58] money are you happy or you're
[2:06:01] not no you don't know how to be happy
[2:06:03] I'm going to take it away from
[2:06:05] you if you're not happy I'll give you to
[2:06:08] someone
[2:06:08] else this is 10,000 it's not small money
[2:06:12] if I give you
[2:06:15] money this brother is he does not know
[2:06:17] how to be
[2:06:19] emotional who knows how to be happy
[2:06:22] who want this money come here one person
[2:06:25] quickly I'll give it to if you know how
[2:06:27] to if you know
[2:06:31] oh this is your money now my sister oh
[2:06:35] hallelujah hallelujah now you see Sister
[2:06:38] Sister
[2:06:39] fortunate received this money and she
[2:06:42] was
[2:06:43] smiling thank you thank you thank but
[2:06:46] now is that emotion the money I've given
[2:06:49] her
[2:06:52] are you following me but the money caus
[2:06:56] that to be
[2:06:57] emotional the emotion was there because
[2:07:01] something
[2:07:02] happened amen God bless you with your
[2:07:04] money

[2:07:13] your listen listen in the same same way
[2:07:18] when the Holy Ghost comes upon you
[2:07:21] you know he is not
[2:07:23] emotional but has come upon you and you
[2:07:27] will become
[2:07:29] emotional you must have emotion because
[2:07:32] the Holy Ghost is
[2:07:34] life the Holy Ghost is power amen the
[2:07:37] Holy Ghost is the manifestation of the
[2:07:40] real power and the person of
[2:07:45] God hallelujah and when he comes upon
[2:07:49] you can you remind the same
[2:07:52] you cannot remain the same some people
[2:07:54] they say I receive the Holy
[2:07:57] Ghost while dreaming it is impossible no
[2:08:02] amen you would have to know you would
[2:08:04] have to desire it you have to ask for it
[2:08:07] you have to wait upon him and when you
[2:08:09] are filled with the power of the Holy
[2:08:12] Ghost you will have life with
[2:08:16] it are you following me now so you see
[2:08:20] the first church
[2:08:21] when the Holy Ghost came
[2:08:24] down just as a leak of fire Came
[2:08:27] Upon you see a woman called
[2:08:30] Mary the mother of
[2:08:33] Jesus Amen you know what happened you
[2:08:36] know the Catholics think she was always
[2:08:38] very you
[2:08:39] know that's why they go to he to
[2:08:42] her mother of God let me tell you when
[2:08:46] she received the Holy Ghost in
[2:08:48] the she must have
[2:08:52] and then shouted and began to speak in
[2:08:56] Tong Mary spoke in
[2:08:59] Tong how many beli say
[2:09:02] Amen Mary spoke in Tong and our religion
[2:09:06] was not
[2:09:07] formal her religion was not dead her
[2:09:11] religion had life on
[2:09:13] it and our Prophet said if you religion
[2:09:17] and is speaking to Believers by
[2:09:21] so if your religion is very dead and
[2:09:25] formal leave that one if it has no
[2:09:29] emotion it it is dead it is good for
[2:09:33] nothing and I will give you another one
[2:09:36] which has
[2:09:38] emotional which will make you shout
[2:09:41] which will make you clap your hands and
[2:09:42] hold which will make you be a real real
[2:09:49] P amen
[2:09:51] and that religion they
[2:09:53] received was the old time religion we
[2:09:55] believe
[2:09:57] in and the Holy Spirit when he
[2:10:00] came he began leading them to the
[2:10:04] truth you know he began leading them
[2:10:07] yeah they had Peter as the
[2:10:09] pastor but Peter was not the one leading
[2:10:12] them it was the Holy Spirit
[2:10:16] leading amen through the preachers and
[2:10:18] the others but the Holy Spirit
[2:10:21] and the word they all said and preached
[2:10:24] the same
[2:10:26] Doctrine and the Holy Spirit Led
[2:10:29] them and and you know heal the people
[2:10:31] signs wonders
[2:10:32] Miracles that is why if you are to
[2:10:35] believe does not have the power of God
[2:10:39] to vindicate it it is
[2:10:42] dead you should be like that
[2:10:45] brother who came and said if God his
[2:10:49] name was Gideon gide he said if God be
[2:10:53] with
[2:10:53] us where are his
[2:10:57] miracles you know the angel of the Lord
[2:10:59] came and talk to him and said Gideon you
[2:11:02] are a man of
[2:11:03] God God is with you he said no no don't
[2:11:06] deceive me don't deceive me and people
[2:11:09] are accepting to go in
[2:11:11] churches where they telling them God is
[2:11:14] with you God is with
[2:11:16] you wait a moment be like Gideon if God
[2:11:20] be with us
[2:11:22] where are his
[2:11:24] miracles you should hunger you should
[2:11:28] thirst to see the
[2:11:30] manifestation of the spirit and power of
[2:11:34] God where you go and pray and God
[2:11:38] moves and does a miracle amen where you
[2:11:42] come in a church and T go out an
[2:11:45] interpretation go out where you come in
[2:11:48] church and prophecy goes out by there
[2:11:51] are the supernatural
[2:11:54] signs
[2:11:56] amen I don't know how I can
[2:11:58] express tell True Religion the true
[2:12:02] gospel has always had the supernatural
[2:12:04] around
[2:12:06] it you cannot take out the
[2:12:10] supernatural from the true
[2:12:12] church and the moment we SE to see
[2:12:16] it it means the seed of
[2:12:19] bamis and the seed of
[2:12:23] has come among us we should always
[2:12:26] desire to see God moving in our
[2:12:29] midst whereby you have a habit you're
[2:12:33] trying to fight the habit but you pray
[2:12:36] you go in fting and prayer and God moves
[2:12:40] and gives you victory over
[2:12:42] that amen whereby God comes down and as
[2:12:47] you I don't know about you but me I
[2:12:49] don't want a religion
[2:12:52] where I am Bound in chain and I cannot
[2:12:55] be
[2:12:56] delivered and if it's the one you are
[2:12:59] having I'm telling you you can bu it we
[2:13:02] have a fresh
[2:13:04] one where you'll come and say I'm
[2:13:06] struggling with this and God will
[2:13:09] deliver you I've seen God deliver so
[2:13:12] many amen I'm one of them amen the
[2:13:17] Apostle Paul said even as we were in
[2:13:19] sins and trespasses
[2:13:23] delivered us the Kingdom of
[2:13:29] Light now let us study this Spirit of
[2:13:35] bism a little more okay brother rang you
[2:13:38] would have to have more voice because we
[2:13:40] are going for one hour more if we are
[2:13:42] going to understand what do ofam is in
[2:13:46] the New Testament Church
[2:13:51] we had better go back and see what it
[2:13:54] was in the Old
[2:13:59] Testament and then we apply it to that
[2:14:01] third third age and then bring it up to
[2:14:04] the
[2:14:07] present and so he
[2:14:16] says the the story is found in numbers
[2:14:19] chapters 22 through 2
[2:14:23] [Music]
[2:14:25] so just so you can go and read it if we
[2:14:28] read it it will take 30
[2:14:30] minutes now we know that Israel was the
[2:14:32] chosen people of
[2:14:35] God they were the pcal of their
[2:14:39] day do we have Pentecostals of
[2:14:43] today they had taken Refuge under the
[2:14:48] blood and they had all been baptized in
[2:14:51] the Red
[2:14:53] Sea and they came up out of the
[2:14:56] waters singing in the
[2:14:59] spirit and dancing under the energy of
[2:15:02] the Holy
[2:15:04] Ghost I love that when I he amen youi
[2:15:09] took a
[2:15:10] tambourine
[2:15:12] dancing oh praise God
[2:15:15] hallelujah and and and you know josu and
[2:15:18] others they began dancing
[2:15:21] but you know people of today they even
[2:15:25] fear to dance for
[2:15:27] Jesus it is a sign you are not yet
[2:15:32] delivered if you can't dance for
[2:15:34] Jesus it means you are dancing somewhere
[2:15:37] else for
[2:15:39] another but let me tell you I don't want
[2:15:41] the devil to take away my
[2:15:44] D Satan can take away
[2:15:47] anything but he can't take away my dance
[2:15:51] you can't take away my joy you can't
[2:15:54] take away my
[2:15:55] happiness my rejoicing for
[2:15:58] Jesus because my joy amen for Jesus is
[2:16:03] my
[2:16:04] strength amen the joy of a
[2:16:07] Believer is her
[2:16:09] strength your strength is not in
[2:16:12] money or in what the world will give you
[2:16:15] our strength is in our
[2:16:19] joy when you are joyful in the
[2:16:21] Lord there are many people in the Bible
[2:16:24] who encourage themselves in the
[2:16:27] Lord how do you encourage yourself in
[2:16:30] the Lord when you are going through
[2:16:32] tough
[2:16:33] time it is by Joy having joy in the Lord
[2:16:36] in the Holy
[2:16:38] Ghost you remember that woman a prophet
[2:16:41] spoke about how her husband was very
[2:16:44] tough on
[2:16:46] him and uh one time you know the the man
[2:16:52] said to have two drunken
[2:16:55] friends let's go at my
[2:16:58] home and I will show you who a genuine
[2:17:01] Christian
[2:17:03] is you know if you're
[2:17:06] married your husband or your wife really
[2:17:08] knows whether you are a genuine
[2:17:13] Christian right so then he came and
[2:17:17] brought
[2:17:18] them and told you know the woman the
[2:17:21] wife to make for them some food
[2:17:25] eggs and when she made the
[2:17:28] eggs uh the man just you know they came
[2:17:31] behaving as if they were drunk but they
[2:17:32] were not drunk
[2:17:36] that and the man just kicked
[2:17:40] it splashed
[2:17:42] everywhere and um he said this is not
[2:17:45] what I asked for make me a better
[2:17:48] one if you are the sister in that
[2:17:51] marriage what do you
[2:17:52] do these days they run
[2:17:55] away because they don't have the joy of
[2:17:58] the
[2:17:59] Lord but if you have the joy of the
[2:18:01] Lord you will know I cannot run
[2:18:04] away from my marriage I want run away
[2:18:08] from my family I'm going to encourage
[2:18:11] myself in the Lord and she
[2:18:15] started Jesus bear the cross alone
[2:18:21] the world go
[2:18:25] free there a cross for
[2:18:31] every
[2:18:32] andoss for
[2:18:35] me she was joyful
[2:18:39] inside and by
[2:18:41] singing the Bible says is there anyone
[2:18:44] mared let them sing so you can't sing
[2:18:47] unless you're
[2:18:49] happy so she was F
[2:18:51] ins even when she was going through
[2:18:54] trouble amen and so the joy of the Lord
[2:18:57] is
[2:19:01] our no matter what you are going
[2:19:03] through no matter the what where life is
[2:19:06] taking
[2:19:07] you always encourage yourself in the
[2:19:13] lord the devil can't understand
[2:19:15] that that's why the devil tries to
[2:19:18] frustrate take away your joy
[2:19:21] never agree with
[2:19:23] him never agree with his
[2:19:26] sadness never agree with his
[2:19:29] depression never agree with his
[2:19:32] frustration always agree with one thing
[2:19:35] word always be
[2:19:38] joyful always be joyful
[2:19:41] sister always be joyful my
[2:19:44] brother regardless of what life brings
[2:19:48] and
[2:19:52] [Music]
[2:19:53] always be
[2:19:55] joyful tell your neighbor always be
[2:20:01] joyful and you can't always be joyful
[2:20:03] unless you have the Holy
[2:20:06] Ghost so these ones were singing in the
[2:20:09] spirit they were dancing under the
[2:20:11] energy of the Holy
[2:20:15] Ghost while Miriam the prophet played
[2:20:17] her tambourin
[2:20:21] well after a certain time of
[2:20:24] Journey these children of Israel came to
[2:20:28] Moab so now they were coming from Egypt
[2:20:30] to the promised
[2:20:32] land and have cross the Red
[2:20:35] Sea and now they were going to Moab
[2:20:38] brother they were going through they
[2:20:39] going to go through the land of
[2:20:42] Moab you remember who Moab
[2:20:45] was he was the son of
[2:20:48] lot by one of his own
[2:20:54] daughters and Lord in turn was a nephew
[2:20:57] of
[2:20:59] Abraham so Israel and Moab were
[2:21:04] related I want you to see that the
[2:21:08] moabites knew the
[2:21:10] truth whether they lived up to it or not
[2:21:13] they knew
[2:21:15] it there are many people who are related
[2:21:17] to us as believers
[2:21:22] they know the truth but they don't
[2:21:24] believe
[2:21:26] it some of them they know it so much
[2:21:28] even more than some
[2:21:31] of let us first track a little bit of
[2:21:33] the genealogy of balam and
[2:21:39] B you know seeing here that
[2:21:42] bam was actually a son the B says the
[2:21:45] son of or
[2:21:47] whatever and B was a son of laan
[2:21:52] andan was um was a son of
[2:21:56] Bethel and whom he begot through
[2:22:02] milka and then you know who was a son of
[2:22:06] Haron and Har was a son of
[2:22:09] Tera and Tera was also the father of
[2:22:13] Abraham so in other words balam came
[2:22:17] from
[2:22:18] Tera and Abraham
[2:22:21] came from Terra these people were also
[2:22:24] related but now
[2:22:26] Bak as we have seen already by the
[2:22:28] prophet
[2:22:30] here he was a
[2:22:32] son he was a king of the
[2:22:36] moabites and the moabites
[2:22:39] were Moab came was a son one of the sons
[2:22:42] of
[2:22:44] lot you remember when God was you know
[2:22:46] destroying Sodom and
[2:22:49] gomorra and how say that now you know
[2:22:51] run don't look
[2:22:53] back and they were running you know lot
[2:22:58] and his two daughters and his
[2:23:01] [Music]
[2:23:02] wife but his wife looked
[2:23:05] back became a pillar of
[2:23:07] soul and so his daughters said to
[2:23:10] themselves look we are now left alone by
[2:23:14] ourselves what are we going to do we
[2:23:17] need to have children
[2:23:20] the whole city is
[2:23:21] gone and so they gave their father
[2:23:25] alcohol and he got
[2:23:28] drunk and then they had children with
[2:23:31] him and so the the each of the girls had
[2:23:36] children one was I believe Ammon and
[2:23:39] another one was
[2:23:41] Moab and so we see that Moab brother
[2:23:44] Moab was a son of
[2:23:47] lot but lot was also a son of of
[2:23:54] har did you get that and actually there
[2:23:58] is a part here that is so
[2:24:00] interesting which I might have confused
[2:24:03] a little bit but I'll correct it here
[2:24:05] for
[2:24:08] youon listen closely who was also a son
[2:24:11] of
[2:24:13] Terror gave birth to a girl called
[2:24:17] mil and now
[2:24:20] you know got
[2:24:22] married to a man
[2:24:27] called was a brother to
[2:24:30] Haron how many are following you're not
[2:24:34] confused right so and Har were
[2:24:38] brothers they were all sons of
[2:24:42] teror so now
[2:24:44] har the brother
[2:24:47] of God gave birth to a daughter called
[2:24:49] milka
[2:24:53] and so
[2:24:55] milka got married
[2:24:59] by how many got it so in other
[2:25:04] words got
[2:25:13] married there's a reason why I'm going
[2:25:15] through this
[2:25:24] got married to her
[2:25:26] uncle the brother to the
[2:25:30] father have you got
[2:25:32] it if you have got it say Amen good
[2:25:38] now now is the one who gave birth to
[2:25:42] Bethel
[2:25:44] with and now out of
[2:25:46] Beth comes laan comes
[2:25:51] and then comes
[2:25:53] Prophet you see the confusion he came
[2:25:55] out
[2:25:57] of Bal was also a relative to
[2:26:03] Abraham but he also came from another
[2:26:08] confusion he was he was a you know he
[2:26:12] was Mo a
[2:26:14] moabit which means he came from incest
[2:26:22] you get a point whereby lot with his
[2:26:26] daughter gave birth to
[2:26:28] Mo and balak was the king of the
[2:26:33] moabites the ones who came from
[2:26:37] [Music]
[2:26:39] incest but lot was also a son of
[2:26:44] har who was a brother of
[2:26:46] Abraham so both
[2:26:49] balam and and B were relatives to
[2:26:56] Abraham are you hearing
[2:26:59] me but the confusion of the
[2:27:06] prophecies and the desire of King
[2:27:11] Bal shows you
[2:27:14] why because the genealogy back
[2:27:18] there was out of
[2:27:23] Fusion but when you go in the
[2:27:26] Lage that God
[2:27:28] LED that God used that God was
[2:27:33] defending that God was fighting for you
[2:27:36] don't see any Corners like
[2:27:40] that straight from from
[2:27:43] ter God comes down he
[2:27:47] leaves he lives
[2:27:50] amen and he comes to a man called
[2:27:54] Abraham and he says Abraham your your
[2:27:57] brothers have
[2:27:58] children but you don't have but I've
[2:28:01] chosen you because I want to make a
[2:28:04] nation out of you let me tell you
[2:28:08] sometimes God can leave his own to be
[2:28:12] baren so that he can make a nation for
[2:28:17] himself don't hurry
[2:28:20] when everybody else is getting
[2:28:22] married and then you get under
[2:28:25] pressure oh can I
[2:28:28] get let me just go with
[2:28:30] this no brother no sister wait upon
[2:28:35] God be led by the Holy
[2:28:38] Ghost hear the voice of
[2:28:43] God and Abraham when he he had the voice
[2:28:47] of
[2:28:48] God his wife was bed
[2:28:51] God said Don't You Worry
[2:28:53] AB I'm going to raise a nation out of
[2:28:55] you out of you will come a great
[2:28:59] nation out of you whoever will bless you
[2:29:04] I will bless whoever will cast you I
[2:29:07] will
[2:29:08] cast I have made a covenant with you
[2:29:12] ab and Abraham listen to the voice of
[2:29:15] God and out of Abraham and
[2:29:21] Isaac amen and out of
[2:29:23] Isaac came Jacob and out of Jacob Moses
[2:29:29] and all the Israelites as we
[2:29:32] know glory to
[2:29:35] God this was a whole a ho
[2:29:38] Lage they were
[2:29:40] Royals they were special even today they
[2:29:45] are when you talk about
[2:29:48] Palestine you talk about these Arab
[2:29:51] Nations let me announce to you today all
[2:29:54] of them are sons of
[2:29:56] Abraham all of
[2:29:58] them have you not heard of the Abraham
[2:30:04] Accords the treaty which
[2:30:07] Israel was trying to
[2:30:11] sign USA was trying to make them sign an
[2:30:15] agreement between isra and the Arab
[2:30:19] Nations
[2:30:20] with this
[2:30:23] idea all of you are
[2:30:25] brothers you are all from
[2:30:28] Abraham
[2:30:30] unite you get a point all of them are
[2:30:32] sons of
[2:30:33] Abraham because even when you go to the
[2:30:35] other tribes the
[2:30:37] isites you know who came from ha that
[2:30:41] one came even from Abraham
[2:30:43] direct and they also had many many
[2:30:46] tribes and even those who did not come
[2:30:49] directly from abrah
[2:30:51] they came from the father of
[2:30:54] Abraham who was teror so you can clearly
[2:30:58] see they all the same
[2:31:01] people but there was a holy
[2:31:05] lineage a lineage God could not
[2:31:09] compromise he said these ones are mine
[2:31:12] and he heard them from the very
[2:31:14] beginning they were B and he made them
[2:31:18] fruitful said a blessing upon
[2:31:21] you no one can be able to Cur
[2:31:23] you and start your family I'll be with
[2:31:27] you you will have children they will
[2:31:29] have children wherever you go I'll go
[2:31:32] with you now I believe today we have
[2:31:36] that same
[2:31:38] rest among the
[2:31:40] Gentiles that is a Christian
[2:31:44] rest amen whereby God has said you are a
[2:31:48] holy priesthood
[2:31:52] royal priesthood you a holy
[2:31:55] nation amen why he said in blessing I'll
[2:31:58] bless you I I take that blessing as my
[2:32:02] own
[2:32:03] blessing he said I'll cast them that
[2:32:05] cast
[2:32:07] you no one can bring down this end time
[2:32:11] message the end time message we are
[2:32:14] talking
[2:32:14] about did not start
[2:32:17] today it started with a
[2:32:22] here in the Bible the teachings they
[2:32:25] taught is what we are teaching today the
[2:32:29] things they believed is what we are
[2:32:31] believing today it has been seven Church
[2:32:35] ages from the days of apostle
[2:32:38] Paul until the days of William
[2:32:41] Bram of teaching the same
[2:32:44] thing the same
[2:32:47] lineage the same line
[2:32:51] blessing how many believe they a part of
[2:32:53] that
[2:32:57] blessing and Israel blessed as they
[2:33:02] were they came through the
[2:33:05] land
[2:33:07] Moab we now know the land of
[2:33:10] Moab it was a l were relatives of
[2:33:16] Abraham now listen
[2:33:18] carefully because the prophet would say
[2:33:20] that balac actually feared
[2:33:24] Abraham meaning he feared the
[2:33:29] Israelites so Israel came up to the
[2:33:31] border of
[2:33:34] Moab are you listening church are you
[2:33:38] listening that's 10% of
[2:33:41] you are you
[2:33:43] listening all right the other brother
[2:33:46] did not answer
[2:33:47] me God bless you listen so Israel came
[2:33:50] up to the borders of
[2:33:54] Moab and S and sent Messengers to the
[2:33:59] king and they said this we are
[2:34:03] brothers let us pass through your
[2:34:07] land if our people our animals eat or
[2:34:10] drink anything we will gladly pay for
[2:34:14] [Music]
[2:34:17] it they just wanted to go through
[2:34:22] but one part cat caught my eye
[2:34:25] here they were not
[2:34:28] poor they could pay for all
[2:34:34] expens hallelu listen have you ever
[2:34:37] heard of this we are pilgrims and we are
[2:34:44] strangers we are just passing
[2:34:48] through Hallelujah
[2:34:50] but we are not poor while we are passing
[2:34:53] through so if you are
[2:34:55] poor find where your blessings have
[2:35:00] gone and we shall see here how Israel
[2:35:03] became po
[2:35:05] poor they became
[2:35:08] impoverished because of this Spirit of
[2:35:11] balam this doctr of
[2:35:15] bamis made them poor they said we
[2:35:18] willing to pay for everything
[2:35:21] but King B got very
[2:35:25] excited that head of that niol Bunch was
[2:35:29] not about to let the church come
[2:35:37] through with its signs and
[2:35:41] wonders and diverse manifestations of
[2:35:44] the Holy
[2:35:45] Ghost did you hear what I just read to
[2:35:48] you
[2:35:50] this
[2:35:51] Bunch the
[2:35:52] Israelites with them they had
[2:35:55] signs with them they had wonders with
[2:35:58] them they had D
[2:36:01] manifestation and balak King balak
[2:36:04] feared
[2:36:09] that you are going through my
[2:36:12] land with their faces shining with the
[2:36:15] glory of God
[2:36:21] it was too
[2:36:23] risky as he might lose some of his
[2:36:29] Crow my my you people missed
[2:36:34] it don't let the spirit
[2:36:37] of
[2:36:38] ofam catch you and then you miss what
[2:36:41] I'm
[2:36:42] preaching the
[2:36:44] of and the spirit of Jezebel and the
[2:36:47] spirit of n
[2:36:49] they work in
[2:36:52] coroporation so the spe of
[2:36:54] Jezebel can come and
[2:36:57] attack and make you not to hear the
[2:37:01] word the spirit of bam will catch
[2:37:05] you and make you not see what God is
[2:37:10] saying so please focus and listen to
[2:37:13] what the Holy Spirit speak
[2:37:22] the kind of things I'm speaking
[2:37:25] today are exposing spirits and
[2:37:31] demons and usually when that
[2:37:34] happens there is a
[2:37:37] battle some of you who are
[2:37:39] spiritual could even feel
[2:37:42] spiritual but it's a battle it's a fight
[2:37:45] and I didn't come here to play I came
[2:37:48] here to consume those demons
[2:37:51] I came here to do
[2:37:53] that and so I'm trying I even ask the
[2:37:56] the deacons you please help us and the
[2:37:58] people please don't do a lot of
[2:37:59] movements because you're disturbing the
[2:38:00] flow of the Holy
[2:38:05] Spirit and when that happens you notice
[2:38:07] that it begins to shift and you know
[2:38:09] people begin to miss what the holy
[2:38:10] spirit is
[2:38:12] [Music]
[2:38:14] saying just stay focused and
[2:38:18] avoid for Le a few more
[2:38:20] minutes just listen to what I'm saying
[2:38:22] here King balak got very
[2:38:26] excited that head of the nian
[2:38:29] buch was not about to let the church
[2:38:31] come
[2:38:34] through with his signs and
[2:38:36] wonders and diverse manifestations of
[2:38:39] the Holy
[2:38:40] G with their faces shining with the
[2:38:43] glory of
[2:38:44] God it was too
[2:38:47] risky as he might lose some of the the
[2:38:50] crowd in other words balak was afraid of
[2:38:54] the glory of God upon these
[2:38:59] people let me tell you when someone has
[2:39:02] a speed of on
[2:39:05] them they fear the
[2:39:09] supernatural when the supernatural
[2:39:12] comes say you are excited when a
[2:39:15] supernatural comes they say you are
[2:39:17] emotional
[2:39:19] but if you are on the side of the
[2:39:22] israelit to you the Supernatural is a
[2:39:24] part of
[2:39:26] you signs and wonders are a part of
[2:39:30] us amen the manifestation of the Holy
[2:39:34] Ghost they are a part of us the glory of
[2:39:38] God shining Upon
[2:39:39] Our let me tell you you cannot
[2:39:42] fail to see someone with the glory
[2:39:46] of when when Moses
[2:39:49] came from the
[2:39:51] mountains and they looked at him his V
[2:39:55] was
[2:39:57] shining the Bible says they could not
[2:39:59] even look on
[2:40:01] [Music]
[2:40:03] him where are you coming
[2:40:06] from what have you been doing this
[2:40:09] week what have you been
[2:40:12] into what are you putting your life
[2:40:15] into it is either taking away the glory
[2:40:20] putting the glory
[2:40:21] on and you can L see
[2:40:24] it when you're looking at a person you
[2:40:27] can see there something Shadow on them
[2:40:31] you can't understand what it
[2:40:33] is usually what I do I ask them how are
[2:40:38] you I'm fine but how are
[2:40:42] you because I'm seeing that
[2:40:45] sh there's no glory a child of God you
[2:40:48] must always be sh
[2:40:52] Glory do not let things take away that
[2:40:56] Glory failed it was so
[2:41:00] risky to let people come in with that
[2:41:04] Glory because they might influence his
[2:41:07] some of his crowd to go with
[2:41:11] them are you hearing me are you hearing
[2:41:15] me that's why as
[2:41:17] pastors we don't protect are
[2:41:21] people it is God who
[2:41:24] does it is God who does someone goes
[2:41:30] to I can't even direct them
[2:41:33] anywhere because I'm
[2:41:35] fearing if they go they might not come
[2:41:38] back and maybe they were giving me some
[2:41:41] good typ
[2:41:43] money let me tell you I don't fear such
[2:41:46] those
[2:41:47] things I don't own anyone
[2:41:50] no p no Pastor owns
[2:41:53] anyone and if God wanted you to be under
[2:41:56] my
[2:41:57] Ministry you will be under my
[2:42:01] Ministry why because I know what I'm
[2:42:04] preaching is the
[2:42:06] truth and let me tell you I have no
[2:42:08] Ministry amen the only Ministry that I
[2:42:11] have is the ministry of Malachi 4 in our
[2:42:16] generation amen the message of the hour
[2:42:20] calling us to come
[2:42:21] out come out of
[2:42:24] denomination come out from the spirit of
[2:42:26] balance and be set and liberated under
[2:42:29] the Holy
[2:42:30] Ghost the two teachings of the
[2:42:34] word had a false
[2:42:37] doctr and he fear to
[2:42:40] mingle he fear those
[2:42:43] people because they had a contagious
[2:42:47] spirit
[2:42:51] let me tell you evil spirits are
[2:42:56] contagious yes look around if you feel
[2:43:00] heavy in your
[2:43:02] eyes look around you someone is doing
[2:43:05] around and and change the
[2:43:08] SE yes the speed of heav can come on
[2:43:13] you because someone else has
[2:43:16] it the truth by the that is the
[2:43:20] truth these demons are
[2:43:23] contagious in the meeting sometimes
[2:43:25] brother would be
[2:43:28] Discerning and he would say there's a
[2:43:30] spirit
[2:43:32] there female
[2:43:34] trouble and I say oh someone else
[2:43:37] here oh they're trying to fight they're
[2:43:39] trying to coordinate
[2:43:42] and and resist the Holy
[2:43:44] Spirit and then what would he do he
[2:43:47] would expose them immediately
[2:43:50] that woman that
[2:43:52] woman you are all set free you are all
[2:43:55] healed and the moment that happens
[2:43:58] people are liberated fre so you see
[2:44:01] demons are
[2:44:03] contagious and they always call for
[2:44:06] support even while I'm preaching by the
[2:44:09] way while I'm
[2:44:10] preaching while preachers
[2:44:12] preach demons call for help
[2:44:19] so the holy spirit is
[2:44:22] contagious if you come inside the buch
[2:44:26] of people that are holy
[2:44:27] go people that love the world people
[2:44:31] that love God people that are joyful in
[2:44:33] their
[2:44:34] heart you cannot remain the
[2:44:38] same if you come you came here today
[2:44:42] today if you came here when you have a
[2:44:44] spirit of heav on you even while you are
[2:44:48] heing the world
[2:44:50] you are being set
[2:44:51] free sometimes amen it's not even what
[2:44:54] I'm
[2:44:55] saying you the brother saying amen or
[2:44:58] the
[2:45:00] sister that can set free
[2:45:03] someone so B
[2:45:06] refused to let Israel pass
[2:45:09] through in fact so great was his fear of
[2:45:14] them that he went to an hearing Prophet
[2:45:18] called
[2:45:24] remember bam was also a relative of
[2:45:27] his was a
[2:45:30] hiring because he was not from the
[2:45:33] linage of the
[2:45:35] Israelites are there prophets true
[2:45:37] prophets out
[2:45:39] there not in the
[2:45:41] message yes
[2:45:44] plenty but there many of them are of the
[2:45:47] likes of bam
[2:45:51] we are looking at the doctrine of
[2:45:54] balam and asked him to meditate between
[2:45:57] him and God Med between him and
[2:46:03] God and petition the almighty to C
[2:46:08] Israel and to render the Israelites
[2:46:13] import and Bam being eager to take part
[2:46:16] in political affairs
[2:46:21] and become a great
[2:46:23] man was only too glad to do
[2:46:26] so there might be
[2:46:29] people that will cooperate with
[2:46:32] Satan to try and make you
[2:46:37] importance they are eager to do so but
[2:46:40] they cannot
[2:46:42] Prevail they
[2:46:44] cannot that I knew many years
[2:46:47] ago when God revealed to me who I
[2:46:51] was a Son of God a royal
[2:46:56] lineage no matter what weapons will be F
[2:47:01] against they could not
[2:47:03] Prosper amen they went and and tried and
[2:47:07] but seeing that he had to approach to
[2:47:09] and receive an audience from God to get
[2:47:11] the people
[2:47:16] cast as he could not do it by himself
[2:47:20] he went to ask God if he could have his
[2:47:23] permission to
[2:47:27] go now isn't that just like the
[2:47:31] niol we have with us
[2:47:34] today they cast everyone that want go
[2:47:36] their
[2:47:41] way you living my
[2:47:44] church The Blessing is going with
[2:47:47] you as a matter of fact I'm cursing
[2:47:53] you some of you have been in such
[2:47:58] churches I'm the blessing of God for
[2:48:00] you and if you don't want to stay
[2:48:03] here you go you don't have my blessing
[2:48:07] in other words you going with a
[2:48:10] car my blessing is not with
[2:48:14] any my blessing is with the message of
[2:48:16] the hour
[2:48:19] my blessing is with
[2:48:21] God why because he called me because he
[2:48:25] elected me because he knew me even
[2:48:28] before the foundation of the world and
[2:48:31] he predestinated me to be his
[2:48:36] son I am
[2:48:40] un I am
[2:48:43] unable it is
[2:48:45] impossible amen hallelujah Hallelujah am
[2:48:49] as long as I'm still working with
[2:48:52] Jesus the of my
[2:48:56] soul I am
[2:48:59] uncastable put it on your lips I am
[2:49:07] unable that is the doctrine of of the
[2:49:12] nians they C everyone that W go their
[2:49:17] way h H
[2:49:20] listen when bam asked God for permission
[2:49:24] to
[2:49:25] go God turned him down God said no you
[2:49:29] can't
[2:49:30] C my that
[2:49:33] St it
[2:49:35] St like a
[2:49:37] be but Bak
[2:49:40] insisted promising him even greater B
[2:49:44] insisted and promising him even great
[2:49:46] rewards and horor
[2:49:51] so went back to
[2:49:52] God now one answer from God should have
[2:49:55] been
[2:49:59] enough but not for the
[2:50:04] selfed When you pray and God answers
[2:50:08] you and you still come back and pray and
[2:50:11] come it means you have your own
[2:50:15] will you want your own will to be done
[2:50:20] but brother when God speaks
[2:50:22] once God can't speak
[2:50:26] twice take what he says in his
[2:50:29] word God has already
[2:50:32] spoken the lion has already
[2:50:35] Ro the message has already
[2:50:37] G God can't change
[2:50:41] it in any area of our
[2:50:43] Liv be it marriage be it family be it
[2:50:48] and family and the church and Ministry
[2:50:52] and gifts and callings God has already
[2:50:55] spoken by his
[2:50:57] word you find a woman preacher going to
[2:51:00] God oh God did you call me confirm to
[2:51:05] me God has already
[2:51:08] spoken first Timothy Chapter 2 I forid a
[2:51:12] woman
[2:51:13] toach or to accept
[2:51:16] Authority it is the word of God
[2:51:19] God has already
[2:51:20] spoken now I agree you as a woman
[2:51:23] preacher you can go and ask
[2:51:27] God and God can tell you
[2:51:29] go there are many who have
[2:51:34] testimonies that is they are under the
[2:51:36] anointing
[2:51:38] of they have their self
[2:51:42] will God never said for them to go but
[2:51:46] God gave them a permissive way
[2:51:51] as we shall see
[2:51:53] here and so B continued
[2:51:56] insisting can I please
[2:51:59] go when God saw his
[2:52:02] pervers he told him to get up and
[2:52:06] go all right you can go oh I can go
[2:52:11] and
[2:52:15] go God Has Told
[2:52:18] spoken to me wait if God has spoken to
[2:52:23] you whatever he say you agree with the
[2:52:28] word if he doesn't agree with the word I
[2:52:32] don't care what voice you
[2:52:34] have you are not in the perfect
[2:52:39] way when God so go him stand up and
[2:52:43] go quickly he s the
[2:52:45] donkey and way he went he should have
[2:52:49] realized that this was simply God's
[2:52:53] permissive and he wouldn't be able to
[2:52:55] cast
[2:52:57] them if he went 20 times and 20 and 20
[2:53:01] and tried 20
[2:53:04] times how like balam are people
[2:53:12] today they believe in three
[2:53:15] Gods get baptized in three titles
[2:53:17] instead of the
[2:53:21] and yet God will send the spirit upon
[2:53:27] them as he did
[2:53:31] upon and they will go on
[2:53:34] believing they are exactly
[2:53:38] right and here they are actually perfect
[2:53:48] who told you that Pentecostals don't
[2:53:50] have the moving of the
[2:53:53] spirit there are some fake
[2:53:55] ones but there are some who truly have
[2:53:58] of
[2:54:00] the even healing
[2:54:03] happens they speak in true T some of
[2:54:07] them and interpret
[2:54:11] them and some mess Believers when
[2:54:15] they so you mean God is also here
[2:54:20] sister God is
[2:54:24] everywhere but the question is the will
[2:54:26] of
[2:54:31] God and yet you know God was not with
[2:54:35] them so they go on
[2:54:37] believing they they teach in three gods
[2:54:40] they don't baptize in the right
[2:54:42] name but God still gives
[2:54:46] them and when I said SP I mean the
[2:54:52] anointing go ahead
[2:54:56] anyway go ahead anyway go ahead
[2:55:00] anyway the
[2:55:02] of do it your way they say well God has
[2:55:06] blessed
[2:55:07] us it must be all right and what do they
[2:55:10] mean God has blessed
[2:55:12] us we now have built a mega
[2:55:15] church they tell if God is not with us
[2:55:19] if you're saying God did not send this
[2:55:22] woman how come she has built this big
[2:55:27] Tabernacle see see the
[2:55:29] church show you do you have a church
[2:55:32] like
[2:55:34] that and then you will look at the
[2:55:37] person and tell them no and then you
[2:55:40] will laugh
[2:55:42] and God has blessed
[2:55:45] them he has 10,000 congregation
[2:55:51] he hased the
[2:55:53] need she has
[2:55:55] done is it
[2:55:57] true it's all true so they say God has
[2:56:00] blessed
[2:56:01] us it must be all right I know he has
[2:56:05] blessed you I don't deny that but it is
[2:56:09] the same organization
[2:56:13] route thatal
[2:56:16] took it's defance to God is
[2:56:21] work it false
[2:56:24] teaching do you know of any denomination
[2:56:26] in the world that God has
[2:56:31] blessed like the Roman
[2:56:34] Catholic look at the
[2:56:37] buildings the most
[2:56:39] beautiful look at the people there is no
[2:56:42] church in the
[2:56:43] world that has big numbers like the
[2:56:46] Roman Cath
[2:56:49] look at the organizations
[2:56:51] they the systems they have bu but yet
[2:56:54] the Roman Catholic Church is right in
[2:56:56] the heart of Revelation
[2:57:00] 17 mystery
[2:57:04] Babylon the Bible says she has made the
[2:57:07] people of God and the kings of the world
[2:57:09] to commit spiritual fornication
[2:57:19] filled with the wine of
[2:57:23] forication and she goes giving
[2:57:27] them what is this it is the false
[2:57:30] Doctrine it's the false
[2:57:33] teaching which are against the
[2:57:36] word and yet God has blessed them more
[2:57:39] than
[2:57:41] everybody it's not what we are looking
[2:57:44] at it is the Defiance to God's word it's
[2:57:48] your first
[2:57:50] teaching the Church of God the Church of
[2:57:53] the
[2:57:55] elect has always been the Chosen
[2:58:00] Few never the
[2:58:03] majority by the way go back go back to
[2:58:05] church
[2:58:06] history you will see what I'm saying it
[2:58:09] has always been the
[2:58:12] minority never the
[2:58:15] majority the Bible even says blessed is
[2:58:17] the little flock
[2:58:20] is the kingdom of
[2:58:21] God the way that leads to Heaven is
[2:58:26] narrow and
[2:58:28] straight straight and narrow but the
[2:58:31] weather leads to
[2:58:34] hell and find
[2:58:37] it me that we are the
[2:58:40] few does not mean we are the
[2:58:43] F being that we are the few is a
[2:58:46] Vindication we are the ones the
[2:58:50] truth that is a bibical
[2:58:54] teaching but always people love the
[2:58:56] numbers the
[2:58:59] crowd and so this man was looking at the
[2:59:03] money was looking at the power and this
[2:59:07] was the anointing he was having to
[2:59:10] preach by the way many preachers
[2:59:13] today what you see think it is
[2:59:16] anointing it is indeed their God they
[2:59:19] they have they have the
[2:59:21] calling they even know the
[2:59:24] word but when they begin to preach the
[2:59:27] manifestations you
[2:59:28] see you think it is because of the
[2:59:31] anointing of the
[2:59:33] spirit but the energy they
[2:59:35] have is to get
[2:59:40] influence
[2:59:41] money a
[2:59:43] name and many of them also to lead the
[2:59:47] scripture said silly women
[2:59:54] cap
[2:59:58] scure and these things are in our
[3:00:01] generation so we need to have the spirit
[3:00:03] of
[3:00:05] designment we need to know what we stand
[3:00:08] for we need to know what we
[3:00:13] believe so balam went w widely down the
[3:00:17] road until angel from God stood in his
[3:00:25] way oh God has called me oh the
[3:00:28] anointing of God is me I already feel
[3:00:31] the anointing when I reach there I
[3:00:34] believe he was
[3:00:40] exising people
[3:00:45] [Music]
[3:00:48] say the
[3:00:49] Lord he sent me I met him behind the
[3:00:53] Rock and I told him God can I go and he
[3:00:58] told me you can go myself side was he
[3:01:02] saying the
[3:01:08] truth and so I'm
[3:01:10] here Divine
[3:01:14] oration I have come to Cur all of you
[3:01:19] it was in his
[3:01:21] head while he was on the
[3:01:24] donkey and on top of that he would see
[3:01:27] himself do that and he would see himself
[3:01:30] get all the
[3:01:31] money get all the power get all the
[3:01:36] clothes I'm going to be a great

[3:06:36] money how can he bless the work of your
[3:06:39] hands if you are not going to serve him
[3:06:41] with
[3:06:44] your so you see the spirit of balam is
[3:06:46] real
[3:06:49] they very B striking
[3:06:51] deals looking for the the deal which
[3:06:53] will burst
[3:06:55] quickly the prophet told
[3:06:58] us that is against the get rich quick
[3:07:01] overnight
[3:07:06] schem you see them all over
[3:07:09] us if you give
[3:07:11] 50,000 and you recruit 10
[3:07:14] people you will make this in just just
[3:07:17] one month two
[3:07:20] months and people have lost
[3:07:24] Millions some of them even borrow
[3:07:27] money and they put their small
[3:07:29] compy instead of bringing it to the land
[3:07:33] fund you are holding the
[3:07:36] money you are holding it and then you
[3:07:38] throw it in some
[3:07:41] of let me tell you if you have money and
[3:07:46] you don't know what to do with it
[3:07:48] give it to the
[3:07:49] Lord give it to the Lord he will mply
[3:07:54] it and when I say the Lord I'm not
[3:07:56] meaning
[3:07:57] myself I mean give it to the work of
[3:08:00] God bring it here we use it to buy the
[3:08:03] church
[3:08:05] land and there is nothing you can give
[3:08:08] God and God doesn't give back to
[3:08:13] you but you find them throwing their
[3:08:16] money
[3:08:18] schemes they think they will get money
[3:08:20] by reasoning and
[3:08:22] thinking those Pon schemes are demonic
[3:08:25] they satanic they are not of
[3:08:30] God why because it has the spirit of
[3:08:34] Bon getting rich
[3:08:37] overnight getting rich
[3:08:39] quickly without hustling
[3:08:44] and that's not right
[3:08:48] it's the same speed of
[3:08:49] B that makes the boys go behind
[3:08:53] the and begin contacting
[3:08:56] sisters and the sister also the spirit
[3:08:59] of
[3:09:01] comes I don't need to tell the
[3:09:03] P I will just finish this deal
[3:09:07] quickly and then we shall go to him when
[3:09:10] it is done and then when things
[3:09:13] bust always when those deals bust they
[3:09:15] bust the side the wrong side
[3:09:22] and then you begin blaming
[3:09:24] everyone blame the spirit
[3:09:28] ofam that caused you not to go God's

[3:10:04] end praise the name of the Lord if you
[3:10:08] want to
[3:10:09] invest in the prophet said
[3:10:12] invest in a
[3:10:14] company that is well proved

[3:10:24] your
[3:10:26] return there are many companies like
[3:10:28] those but I'll tell you one which is

[3:10:37] word if you invest your time if you
[3:10:40] invest your money invest your resources
[3:10:44] in serving
[3:10:45] God always expect a
[3:10:50] return Hallelujah and the return will be
[3:10:53] more than you
[3:10:57] expected Now give me more a few more
[3:11:00] minutes like
[3:11:01] 20 normally I would be done by now it is
[3:11:03] one but just
[3:11:05] us continue for a few more minutes
[3:11:08] because I may not you don't come on
[3:11:10] Wednesday so I want to finish up
[3:11:14] this all right listen there he
[3:11:18] to block the Mad Prophet now okay I just
[3:11:21] go back a little bit
[3:11:24] here all right so balam went wildly down
[3:11:28] the
[3:11:29] road until an angel from God stood in
[3:11:32] his
[3:11:33] way but that
[3:11:35] Prophet
[3:11:37] Bishop that
[3:11:39] Cal that
[3:11:41] chairman that president that General
[3:11:45] overseer meaning they have the big
[3:11:48] titles but they are blind to the
[3:11:52] word that Prophet was so
[3:11:55] blinded to spiritual
[3:11:58] things the thought of honor and glory
[3:12:00] and
[3:12:04] money that he could not see the angel
[3:12:07] standing with a drone
[3:12:13] SW
[3:12:15] Brethren let us have spiritual
[3:12:19] you go back on the service I preached on
[3:12:22] Wednesday the danger of of tur down the
[3:12:28] word turn down the
[3:12:30] word and when you turn down the word God
[3:12:34] will blind your
[3:12:35] eyes you can't
[3:12:38] see and the angel was standing there
[3:12:42] with but was blind as a
[3:12:49] praise
[3:12:50] God there he
[3:12:53] stood there he stood to block the Mad
[3:13:00] Prophet the little donkey saw him and
[3:13:03] dodged back and forth
[3:13:07] finally crashed Bam's
[3:13:13] foot the ass
[3:13:16] stopped would not go on he could not
[3:13:21] soam jumped
[3:13:23] off and began
[3:13:26] be the donkey then began to
[3:13:31] talk God let that donkey speak in a
[3:13:37] tongue that donkey was no
[3:13:42] hybrid original
[3:13:47] if God could make an original breed seed
[3:13:50] donkey speak in
[3:13:55] [Applause]
[3:13:56] Tong how much more will he make the
[3:13:59] original Church speak in
[3:14:04] time he the same
[3:14:06] God this was not a
[3:14:10] mule it was a donkey
[3:14:13] original and it began speaking
[3:14:17] he said to the blinded
[3:14:20] Prophet am I not your
[3:14:22] donkey and I carried you
[3:14:27] Faithfully still blinded
[3:14:30] reply yes yes you are my donkey and you
[3:14:33] have cared me Faithfully until now and
[3:14:36] if I can't get you
[3:14:38] going I'm going to kill
[3:14:40] you what's that talking talking to a
[3:14:44] donkey that's funny I thought I had had
[3:14:47] the donkey
[3:14:49] talking and I was answering
[3:14:54] back God has always spoken in a
[3:14:58] tongue he spoke at baz's feast and then
[3:15:01] at
[3:15:04] Pentecost he is doing it today
[3:15:08] again hallelujah amen when a tongue is
[3:15:12] from
[3:15:13] God it is not to confuse
[3:15:17] is to bring
[3:15:21] Clarity forget about these Tong that
[3:15:23] they do in
[3:15:28] their and then you ask them what does
[3:15:31] it I'm just praying in
[3:15:34] the it's all right but do it in your
[3:15:36] private
[3:15:38] closet but in the
[3:15:41] church if you speak in a
[3:15:44] tongue it should be interpreted
[3:15:48] either by
[3:15:49] you or by another
[3:15:52] person it should be
[3:15:54] interpreted that's the T we see on the
[3:15:58] Pentecost that's the the T we see here
[3:16:00] when the donkey
[3:16:02] spoke at the Feast of the
[3:16:06] king and you know it's the same T if
[3:16:10] they do not need
[3:16:12] interpretation it was what people could
[3:16:15] hear if they couldn't hear needed
[3:16:20] interpretation nonetheless we believe in
[3:16:24] tongues some Churches of the
[3:16:27] message because was trying to straighten
[3:16:30] this thing
[3:16:32] out they they got a
[3:16:36] bias on
[3:16:38] tongues when you hear them preaching
[3:16:41] it's like they're preaching against
[3:16:43] them for us we believe in them
[3:16:48] as a matter of fact if they are not
[3:16:50] there in our church we need to have
[3:16:53] another
[3:16:55] touch but thank God we've seen it happen
[3:16:57] here many many many
[3:16:59] times and I say we want more of it
[3:17:03] Lord what is it is usually a message
[3:17:06] from God himself to the
[3:17:10] church it's a
[3:17:12] warning of sooncoming
[3:17:15] judgment then the was made a visible to
[3:17:20] balam he told balam that except for the
[3:17:23] donkey he would be dead even
[3:17:29] now but when balam promised to go
[3:17:32] back he was sent on with admonition to
[3:17:35] say only what God gave
[3:17:39] you listen to this next words so balam
[3:17:42] went
[3:17:43] down and set up oh my this this this
[3:17:47] really moved me set up seven
[3:17:51] altars for the clean Beast of
[3:17:56] sacrifice he killed the signy the coming
[3:17:59] of the
[3:18:00] Mah he knew what to do to approach unto
[3:18:05] God now listen he had the mechanics just
[3:18:09] right
[3:18:18] but not the
[3:18:20] Dynamics same as
[3:18:22] now can't you see it
[3:18:26] nans there was Israel down there in the
[3:18:30] valley offering the same
[3:18:32] sacrifice doing the same thing but only
[3:18:36] one had the signs
[3:18:38] following only one had God in their
[3:18:42] M it doesn't listen listen this message
[3:18:45] will be preached every
[3:18:49] but let me tell you Brethren not
[3:18:51] everywhere the message is preached God
[3:18:53] is in that
[3:18:56] come how do you know God is in the camp
[3:18:59] when the signs and wonders are
[3:19:03] following hallelujah amen brother come
[3:19:06] up here you know what is this amen this
[3:19:10] is a sign and a
[3:19:12] wonder I changed
[3:19:14] life you believe that
[3:19:17] you believe
[3:19:18] that I wish I was
[3:19:21] allowed I tell you about the young
[3:19:25] man and his
[3:19:27] secs but this is a changed
[3:19:31] life is a is a
[3:19:33] Wonder to the devil it's not the only
[3:19:37] one they are
[3:19:39] more their lives should
[3:19:41] change not only that Miracles should
[3:19:45] happen Tong should
[3:19:48] healing must
[3:19:49] happen jobs must be
[3:19:51] received where's the brother that did
[3:19:53] not have a job here I don't
[3:19:55] know is he now at
[3:19:59] work he came up here and gave a
[3:20:02] testimony he said oh I didn't have a job
[3:20:06] iay God give me a job that's what we
[3:20:10] believe God must manifest
[3:20:12] himself Amen in signs and wonders in
[3:20:15] miracles power the moving of the Holy
[3:20:18] Ghost when you see the message and you
[3:20:22] see the manifestation of the Holy Ghost
[3:20:25] then God is in that
[3:20:29] c hallelujah amen
[3:20:33] but the camp of
[3:20:35] balam they they had everything
[3:20:38] right they had form but they want get
[3:20:41] you
[3:20:44] anywhere can't take the place of the
[3:20:46] Spirit
[3:20:49] manifestation doctr only does not help
[3:20:54] us let me emphasize
[3:20:56] that you've seen people I don't want to
[3:20:59] talk about I'm not picking on people
[3:21:01] really there be some that would just say
[3:21:04] the mystery of this The Mystery of the
[3:21:07] Myster listen the message is not only
[3:21:11] the revelation of the
[3:21:14] mystery the message is to the
[3:21:16] manifestation of the life of
[3:21:23] God that is what happened
[3:21:26] at they put over's
[3:21:30] Doctrine not the doctr of
[3:21:32] God and they stumbled and they
[3:21:36] fell they became dead
[3:21:39] men and the sacrifice was made balam was
[3:21:42] ready to prophesy
[3:21:46] now he has come everything is
[3:21:49] ready you have those people prophesy
[3:21:53] Papa was to
[3:21:58] prophesy but God tied his
[3:22:02] Tong and he could not Cur
[3:22:06] them he blessed
[3:22:09] them hallelujah
[3:22:12] hallelujah glory to
[3:22:14] God just give me 10
[3:22:18] was very angry but there was nothing
[3:22:21] that balam could
[3:22:23] do the
[3:22:25] prophecy it had been spoken by the Holy
[3:22:28] Ghost so told bam to go down below into
[3:22:32] the valley and look upon their back
[3:22:34] parts to see if there wasn't Vis
[3:22:36] possibly some way he could cast
[3:22:44] them he said turn around
[3:22:47] I'm showing you the
[3:22:49] of first it was trying to
[3:22:53] C no matter
[3:22:55] what just getting the things money and
[3:22:57] then you go
[3:22:58] C you see they are paid to preach what

[3:23:43] tithe because out of
[3:23:45] that we shall support the
[3:23:49] ministry but usually in a small Church

[3:31:22] just a few
[3:31:24] moments praise the name of the Lord
[3:31:27] friends these are the things burning up
[3:31:28] the
[3:31:32] generation the spirit of balam is very
[3:31:34] [Music]
[3:31:36] tacal he knows how to destroy so now
[3:31:39] this time you know balak advised
[3:31:43] balam he said let us change the
[3:31:47] tactic don't go to cast them when facing
[3:31:51] with them go
[3:31:55] behind and see their behind
[3:32:00] [Music]
[3:32:01] Parts maybe you might find an an
[3:32:04] opportunity
[3:32:08] to they back
[3:32:10] aparts and the prophet says
[3:32:13] here the tactics that used at the same
[3:32:16] TX they use
[3:32:19] today the big denominations look down at
[3:32:22] the little
[3:32:24] groups and anything they find among
[3:32:27] them make out a
[3:32:31] scand anything they find out among them
[3:32:33] to make out a
[3:32:36] scand they bring it out and shout
[3:32:40] it if the moderns live in sin no one
[3:32:43] says anything about it
[3:32:47] but let one of the El get in
[3:32:54] trouble you will see the speed of B
[3:32:59] ring every peer blast across
[3:33:04] the Israel had a
[3:33:09] back but says the back parts are the
[3:33:12] parts
[3:33:16] you know whereby it says they had their
[3:33:18] side that wasn't
[3:33:23] praiseworthy but in spite of their
[3:33:27] imperfection by the purpose of God that
[3:33:30] works through
[3:33:33] election by grace and not by
[3:33:36] words they had their Cloud by day and P
[3:33:39] of Fire by
[3:33:42] night they had the smitten Rock The
[3:33:47] Serpent and they had signs and
[3:33:50] wonders they were
[3:33:53] Vindicated not in themselves but in
[3:33:57] godu and we see the same thing many
[3:34:01] times the spirit of bam begins to come
[3:34:03] and creep into the
[3:34:06] church how do you know it it will always
[3:34:10] before even the deons and the pastors
[3:34:13] andbody it will be able to find out
[3:34:16] people who are living wrong kind of
[3:34:21] life you find someone possessed
[3:34:26] with
[3:34:30] so TT every saying
[3:34:34] Believers
[3:34:38] everywh telling you what is it haven't
[3:34:42] we seen those
[3:34:43] Spirits we have seen them they know how
[3:34:46] to find the back
[3:34:49] of where they not
[3:34:52] praiseworthy let me tell you none of us
[3:34:54] is
[3:34:56] perfect from preacher to
[3:34:59] lady from the
[3:35:02] youngest we are all saved by
[3:35:06] grace none is perfect in
[3:35:10] himself but there's one
[3:35:12] thing that lifts up a believer
[3:35:16] when you fall you don't remain you rise
[3:35:22] upu but the devil will
[3:35:25] always what you
[3:35:29] did go back even years
[3:35:32] ago and begin picking
[3:35:36] things but who is that one telling us
[3:35:39] this this is the same person who they
[3:35:42] were saying was
[3:35:46] no don't tell me anything it's a spirit
[3:35:48] of balance to try to
[3:35:53] discredit and now they bring something
[3:35:55] which you know you
[3:35:58] did and you begin to feel
[3:36:00] heavy for
[3:36:03] sure what was the
[3:36:07] purpose did not want them to go
[3:36:10] through wanted them to be
[3:36:13] discouraged either die or they go back
[3:36:17] so this was to break them the devil will
[3:36:19] bring these things to
[3:36:21] break let me tell if you have done
[3:36:23] something
[3:36:24] wrong in your past and you have
[3:36:27] confessed it and you have repented it
[3:36:31] God no longer
[3:36:33] remember don't allow the
[3:36:35] devil to weaken you because of your
[3:36:40] parts that are not praised
[3:36:46] never allow
[3:36:48] it a
[3:36:50] spe it to
[3:36:52] weaken and then you feel like for sure
[3:36:55] I'm not even
[3:36:57] worthy what can I even do for
[3:37:00] god brother
[3:37:06] come maybe call the other
[3:37:11] brother you're now
[3:37:13] quiet because you are all
[3:37:16] having those
[3:37:18] parts but if God was to take a
[3:37:21] person and said this is the only one
[3:37:23] going to
[3:37:24] serve doesn't have the
[3:37:27] back none of us would
[3:37:30] serve we are all serving by
[3:37:37] grace and even with
[3:37:40] that he
[3:37:42] failed now I'm going to skip everything
[3:37:46] and go to the part I told
[3:37:50] you now in spite of the fact that bam
[3:37:52] knew the proper approach to
[3:37:57] God and could bring forth a revelation
[3:37:59] from the Lord by means of a special
[3:38:01] endur endur of
[3:38:07] power he was still for all of that a
[3:38:10] bishop in the first group
[3:38:16] for what he did do now in order to win
[3:38:19] favor with
[3:38:24] bar he now he for now this is the pl I
[3:38:27] want to finish he formulated a
[3:38:34] plan tell your neighbor he
[3:38:39] formul now in this plan wherein God
[3:38:41] would be forced to deal with Israel in
[3:38:44] death
[3:38:53] you can interpr
[3:39:00] the Satan knew that he could beg beg
[3:39:08] Eve her to fall in fleshly
[3:39:12] sin th causing God to pass his
[3:39:15] pronounced sentence of death
[3:39:21] against soam knew that if we could get
[3:39:27] Israel
[3:39:30] to God would have to deal with
[3:39:34] them so he planned a
[3:39:37] way to get them to come over and join in
[3:39:42] sin
[3:39:47] he now sent out
[3:39:50] [Music]
[3:39:52] invitations invitations to come to the
[3:39:54] Fe
[3:39:57] of come over and worship with
[3:40:00] us come in our church come and pray for
[3:40:04] us we give you money come and visit us
[3:40:07] also and then you just go among them but
[3:40:11] also not only that something that is
[3:40:14] happening have a a worldy
[3:40:17] friend and he says come just
[3:40:20] go to the
[3:40:22] Disco is only
[3:40:26] once and then you are very naive
[3:40:31] sister don't
[3:40:33] drink no
[3:40:35] problem it is only a small
[3:40:38] party a house
[3:40:40] part but you know all of them are
[3:40:44] unbeliever I tell you don't worry
[3:40:47] everything will be fine and then you
[3:40:49] just
[3:40:50] go it's all right sister you
[3:40:53] go
[3:40:55] part of
[3:40:57] nonbelievers you are
[3:41:00] finished brother you
[3:41:02] finished because you have believed the
[3:41:05] doctrine
[3:41:08] ofam when he saw he couldn't cast
[3:41:11] them he he couldn't find any back parts
[3:41:13] or whatever
[3:41:16] said all right I'm going to make them
[3:41:18] fall in
[3:41:20] sin and the sin they will fall in is the
[3:41:23] sin of
[3:41:25] fornication and how they will do it I
[3:41:27] will send out
[3:41:29] invitation so you find brother saying it
[3:41:33] is all right is just a small part of my
[3:41:38] friend and then you go
[3:41:41] there and they went there the younger
[3:41:43] people they began
[3:41:47] only for once I don't believe it in my
[3:41:50] heart but even the songs they not they
[3:41:52] playing they're not very bad like that
[3:41:56] not really bad it is like

[3:43:23] Israelites and they were drawn into
[3:43:31] adulter from that
[3:43:34] moment began

[3:44:33] and how far is it have they gone in oh
[3:44:37] yeah he's
[3:44:38] going that's wa they begin singing songs
[3:44:43] in are you hearing young people

[3:45:19] worldly
[3:45:20] part because the believer is going to
[3:45:28] church I believer what are you going to
[3:45:31] do
[3:45:32] there after
[3:45:36] all is just
[3:45:39] beautiful when I the man preaches
[3:45:42] his you go you go
[3:45:47] we don't have our portion
[3:45:49] [Music]
[3:45:53] there when you go among
[3:45:56] them before you know it you are going to
[3:45:59] come out with
[3:46:04] Spirits
[3:46:08] willor tell what you talking about
[3:46:11] because the girls that are there the
[3:46:13] boys that are there
[3:46:15] are not
[3:46:17] Sanctified they don't believe what you
[3:46:20] believe their gospel is different their
[3:46:23] inspiration is
[3:46:25] different you go among them you going to
[3:46:28] begin behaving
[3:46:30] like and you find those young people in
[3:46:33] the
[3:46:34] message the problem with our message
[3:46:36] preachers complicating Grace they don't
[3:46:40] understand
[3:46:41] what does it mean you have to dress
[3:46:43] something very long
[3:46:45] for you to be a
[3:46:47] believer because they went
[3:46:50] among and they saw
[3:47:02] someone but when he comes back in his
[3:47:06] church I hope it's not one of those dead
[3:47:08] message
[3:47:10] churches no
[3:47:12] life but my sisters in the church
[3:47:15] always
[3:47:18] dry but when I go there they are
[3:47:21] spiritual and then he begins making a
[3:47:23] walk they begin on these groups
[3:47:26] of does it mean if you a Believer you
[3:47:31] should wear a skirt which is reaching
[3:47:33] down no you can be spiritual sister even
[3:47:38] when you have a
[3:47:42] Min they have a speed of
[3:47:45] it has already
[3:47:47] begun and before you know it these same
[3:47:50] same people they are living in
[3:47:53] immorality why because the spirit of has
[3:47:58] eaten to a Believer you should never
[3:48:02] have a
[3:48:03] debate how long should your
[3:48:06] SC there should never be
[3:48:09] a why because the Holy Ghost will teach
[3:48:12] you
[3:48:15] hallelujah amen the Holy Ghost will tell
[3:48:17] you you don't need to undress you don't
[3:48:20] need to show your nakedness you need to
[3:48:22] cover yourself up why are you opening
[3:48:25] your
[3:48:26] body why to entice young
[3:48:30] men cause them to
[3:48:32] S have a spirit of
[3:48:37] you I'm not angry I don't know what is
[3:48:40] happening
[3:48:41] also but I I believe God loves all
[3:48:46] God loves you and that's why he's giving
[3:48:49] you the
[3:48:51] truth friends in finishing here I'm done
[3:48:56] I'm
[3:48:57] done we find
[3:48:59] out that these
[3:49:01] people they
[3:49:03] Sinn the younger men they went and
[3:49:07] shared
[3:49:09] beds of adultery of immorality with the
[3:49:13] women of Mor
[3:49:15] and they came
[3:49:17] out
[3:49:18] [Music]
[3:49:23] Brothers God bless
[3:49:26] you but when you look at them you don't
[3:49:29] see the
[3:49:32] glory I mean but how are you I'm
[3:49:37] fine but they know where they
[3:49:42] were let me tell you friend
[3:49:45] there was one young
[3:49:46] man when that was going on he had a
[3:49:50] Javin in his
[3:49:51] hand he was so filled with the
[3:49:55] Ang of the Holy
[3:49:57] Ghost when he went in one of the
[3:50:00] rooms and he saw this
[3:50:03] brother and this little
[3:50:08] Moab
[3:50:10] them and went through the other
[3:50:17] and he came out feeling a
[3:50:20] bit do you know how many people God
[3:50:22] killed that
[3:50:24] day
[3:50:28] 23000 all they wanted was to go through
[3:50:34] Mo
[3:50:36] refused and when he refused he hired
[3:50:41] balam to cast them but he couldn't cast
[3:50:44] them
[3:50:45] but the only way he could defeat
[3:50:47] them was the plan he
[3:50:50] devised to cause them to
[3:50:55] for now friends this is where we are
[3:51:00] again the spirit of bam is
[3:51:04] alive many message
[3:51:07] Believers are still holding true in the
[3:51:09] belief of the
[3:51:12] truth but their life
[3:51:15] does not measure
[3:51:18] up they're living in ad they're living
[3:51:22] in and you cannot live in
[3:51:26] ofation and you do not do it
[3:51:29] spiritually you cannot be a genuine
[3:51:33] belever what is physical will also be
[3:51:37] your reflection of
[3:51:39] the you cannot grow
[3:51:41] spirit and that will bring the wrath of
[3:51:43] God upon you
[3:51:46] and that's the
[3:51:48] of and the Bible says God hates
[3:51:50] it do you hate it and I pray that if
[3:51:54] there be anyone of
[3:51:55] you who has been captured by
[3:51:58] the the musicians can the spirit of bam
[3:52:03] I pray that while you we go to prayer
[3:52:07] now you'll be able to put your life
[3:52:11] right there are many many more things I
[3:52:13] would have said
[3:52:16] but because of time I can't
[3:52:19] continue let us stand on our
[3:52:23] feet the spirit of
[3:52:28] balam the
[3:52:31] spirit which will
[3:52:33] go into false
[3:52:37] Doctrine you will lay a stumbling block
[3:52:39] before the children of
[3:52:43] Israel give yourself to commit
[3:52:47] fornication this
[3:52:49] spirit and that's why we read in First
[3:52:52] Corinthians where he
[3:52:54] said neither be
[3:52:57] idolators and don't last after evil
[3:53:02] things the people that sat down to eat
[3:53:04] and drink rose up to
[3:53:08] play we saw them what happened in
[3:53:12] numbers neither let us commit for
[3:53:16] as some of
[3:53:17] them committed and fell
[3:53:23] in may God have
[3:53:25] mercy but if you're living that kind of
[3:53:28] life that's the only way the
[3:53:33] enemy but if you live
[3:53:37] right the enemy has no power over
[3:53:41] you Hallelujah
[3:53:44] that's something that we could talk more
[3:53:46] but let's just uh go in a little worship
[3:53:48] if you want to pray you can just come at
[3:53:49] the altar Pray by
[3:53:52] yourself and ask God his grace upon your
[3:53:56] life amen let us sing Holiness

[4:19:37] Jesus name I pray amen
[4:19:40] [Applause]
[4:19:45] the Lord bless you so
[4:19:46] [Music]
[4:19:47] much uh
[4:19:55] [Music]
[4:19:58] we we' come close to the close of our
[4:20:01] service
[4:20:01] [Music]
[4:20:04] tonight but before we
[4:20:06] [Music]
[4:20:08] go before we go uh I just wanted to
[4:20:14] let you
[4:20:16] know that our carpet here is
[4:20:22] old need to let you know you already
[4:20:26] know and a few people have come and told
[4:20:28] us the carpet is
[4:20:33] on so it's
[4:20:36] compromising our
[4:20:40] quality I believe even before we go to
[4:20:42] our place
[4:20:45] I'm a person who believes in
[4:20:48] excellence I believe in the best or
[4:20:53] nothing so and that's I believe what
[4:20:56] children of God have to
[4:20:59] be we should not settle for
[4:21:02] less how many agree with
[4:21:05] me and so we either need to replace the
[4:21:11] carpet which will cost us about 1
[4:21:13] million
[4:21:16] shs or we do something else as an
[4:21:22] option um so I spoke with together with
[4:21:26] one of the
[4:21:28] deacons I spoke to uh the owner of the
[4:21:34] hotel and we told
[4:21:37] him uh we we pay him rent
[4:21:41] [Music]
[4:21:43] but we are not
[4:21:45] satisfied we were talking about the
[4:21:48] washrooms and then the the the tiing
[4:21:53] inside
[4:21:55] here so we came to a conclusion on both
[4:22:00] issues
[4:22:02] um for the washrooms I think we Brother
[4:22:05] Martin will give us the
[4:22:09] report uh but for the for the inside
[4:22:14] here we agreed um that he would do he
[4:22:19] want he wanted to put something it's not
[4:22:21] t what is it
[4:22:23] called
[4:22:26] yes so and he said now the money you
[4:22:28] have given me I already had other
[4:22:32] programs you know we had just paid him
[4:22:35] how much brother
[4:22:36] [Music]
[4:22:38] Jo 4.8
[4:22:41] million being for rent for how many
[4:22:47] months six months yes so now we needed
[4:22:51] to so he said okay I can put
[4:22:55] Tero if you pay me extra three
[4:23:02] months it's not for it's for your
[4:23:07] rent if you pay it to
[4:23:09] me then I will right away get the person
[4:23:12] and we begin on
[4:23:16] the so we we have two
[4:23:21] options we we pay for rent for extra
[4:23:24] three
[4:23:27] months that is 800 * 3 how much is
[4:23:34] that
[4:23:38] 2.4 or we buy the the caret of about 1
[4:23:46] million how many say we should buy the
[4:23:57] caret how many say I only had one person
[4:23:59] how many
[4:24:01] say we should pay the three months extra
[4:24:08] rent and we they put ter here
[4:24:17] yeah if you're a member of the church
[4:24:18] lift up your hand
[4:24:21] up how many say okay thank you how many
[4:24:24] say we should do none of the
[4:24:29] above okay so I think even the one who
[4:24:34] had raised up their hand for carpet
[4:24:37] finally put it
[4:24:40] down so we are unanimously
[4:24:44] accepting rent of three extra
[4:24:50] months um that
[4:24:52] means we have two options
[4:24:55] now we we contribute the money now now
[4:25:02] now through
[4:25:05] ples or we still reduce on our land
[4:25:16] uh after all rent whether we we pay it
[4:25:19] now or later it is still
[4:25:23] rent expens we are going to
[4:25:26] make the other one we took it from the
[4:25:28] land
[4:25:31] fund I believe people should be able to
[4:25:33] pledge
[4:25:35] it and say me I'm going to give
[4:25:39] 300 I have some Savings of 500 give
[4:25:43] I have 1 million I'll give it and then
[4:25:46] we finish it we can do
[4:25:50] that so how many are ready to pledge
[4:25:53] some significant
[4:25:58] amount
[4:26:00] am of course if you want to be blessed
[4:26:06] big you have to have a big big b to
[4:26:09] carry it
[4:26:13] yes so if if God has trusted you with
[4:26:18] little they have served him well with
[4:26:22] it it means you have a heart for a
[4:26:24] bigger
[4:26:26] bless so I want those who are going to
[4:26:28] generously
[4:26:32] give so that we can raise the 2.4
[4:26:38] million without digging on the land fund
[4:26:40] again
[4:26:44] actually brother
[4:26:46] brother Baka say that uh we we we had um
[4:26:50] we would have been around 6 we would
[4:26:52] have been more because we also when we
[4:26:53] were coming here we spent almost 10
[4:26:54] million you
[4:26:59] remember have been going to close
[4:27:04] to but rent is eating up on
[4:27:08] us is not
[4:27:11] good so God should take us out of
[4:27:14] R and give us our own
[4:27:16] land the owner of the hotel told told us
[4:27:21] recently that he received
[4:27:24] news we have already purchased our
[4:27:27] land I told Brother Martin don't tell
[4:27:30] him no just say Amen because usually
[4:27:35] when God is about to bless
[4:27:37] you your enemy knows before you
[4:27:43] so if he said that he
[4:27:45] had already bought Church
[4:27:47] land it means it has already been hard
[4:27:49] in
[4:27:52] another already know we have read about
[4:27:54] it before we can even be able to
[4:27:58] purchase let us look at the
[4:28:02] Unseen those who are giving I encourage
[4:28:04] you to
[4:28:06] continue I'm heing groups who were
[4:28:08] gathering 200 300 150
[4:28:14] I had
[4:28:16] given I don't think there is some
[4:28:18] significant
[4:28:20] change in your
[4:28:22] incomes in any case I believe your
[4:28:24] income is
[4:28:26] becoming no it is becoming better is it
[4:28:30] becoming better is it the same as last
[4:28:31] year yes so friends what I'm saying we
[4:28:36] should increase our giv not reduce it
[4:28:42] giving shows that we are pursuing the
[4:28:48] vision my precious brother put your
[4:28:50] friend in your
[4:28:54] group if you have friends invite
[4:28:58] them one of us called one of his
[4:29:00] brothers he gave one
[4:29:03] million let us give some where are the
[4:29:06] group team
[4:29:08] leaders we have friends that love us and
[4:29:10] they come to fellowship with us
[4:29:15] if you see some new talk to
[4:29:17] them don't force them but encourage them
[4:29:22] I believe most of our team leaders are
[4:29:23] good sales
[4:29:27] people they're doing a good
[4:29:29] job so with those
[4:29:33] words I'd like um to have hands
[4:29:37] up brother Andrew if you could get a pen
[4:29:39] and paper we col some substantial
[4:29:49] offerings you say I want to give this I
[4:29:51] want to give that they write you down
[4:29:54] and then you give
[4:30:00] us we need 2.4 million
[4:30:08] shs I think this is yours so are we
[4:30:12] moving around just raise up your hand
[4:30:14] the brother will come to
[4:30:15] you some of you are going to pledge by
[4:30:17] faith you'll get the
[4:30:28] money but you're going to give
[4:30:32] it there Breen who pledge and don't
[4:30:37] give we rather get one plge that will
[4:30:40] pay
[4:30:42] I don't want to Pastor people with
[4:30:48] cures we need people who promise God and
[4:30:51] fulfill their
[4:30:54] pledges the money we are
[4:30:58] pledging the the remaining will be got
[4:31:01] from the church
[4:31:04] land so those who don't want us to cut

[4:31:20] other giving how it is being
[4:31:30] used but we did not last last year we
