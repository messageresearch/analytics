[1:28:13] but God is God
[1:28:16] the Bible says that he watches over
[1:28:21] he watches over his own
[1:28:25] the brother that God told me to go to uh
[1:28:33] before I went again
[1:28:38] the brother that God told me to go to

[1:37:30] the parishes
[1:37:41] the story how a man can can make a great
[1:37:46] supper
[1:37:50] send out invitations

[1:38:50] [Applause]
[1:39:00] now listen to this the Rapture was not
[1:39:03] made for everybody
[1:39:05] the Rapture was only for it's supposed
[1:39:08] to be for a
[1:39:12] foreign are you hearing me
[1:39:15] so the gospel as we know it plain gospel
[1:39:21] by very many all over the world

[1:39:28] just say what I'm saying exactly the way

[1:40:05] um should I call it a gospel message
[1:40:10] how many don't understand English
[1:40:14] okay how many understand English for
[1:40:16] people

[1:40:20] everyone the one that you will believe
[1:40:22] the gospel we'll go to the Rapture
[1:40:24] actually there are very many people are
[1:40:26] going to receive the Gospel and they
[1:40:28] will attain eternal life but they will
[1:40:29] never go to and so now we have a message
[1:40:32] and this message is to the bride now we
[1:40:35] have of course I shared on that many
[1:40:38] years ago on the different categories of
[1:40:41] people in the economy of God and so this
[1:40:44] morning I want us to see the purpose of
[1:40:46] the message if you can turn with me to
[1:40:47] the Book of Revelation chapter 19.
[1:40:55] and I'm going to look at verse 7 to
[1:40:57] verses 9. it says let us be glad and
[1:41:01] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:41:03] wedding and to her was granted that she
[1:41:05] should be a raid in fine linen clean and
[1:41:08] white for the fine linen is the
[1:41:10] righteousness of the Saints and he saith
[1:41:13] unto them right blessed are they which
[1:41:15] are called unto the marriage supper of
[1:41:18] the lamb and he said unto them unto me
[1:41:21] these are the true sayings of God now
[1:41:27] since many are invited to take part in
[1:41:29] eternal life the gospel invitation is a
[1:41:32] wide invitation to everyone who cares to
[1:41:34] come you know you know everybody you
[1:41:37] know you find them on the streets you
[1:41:38] find them they are they have different
[1:41:40] Church names they they are called
[1:41:42] Anglican according to their works but
[1:41:46] let me ask you a question if Jesus died
[1:41:48] what why there is the Bible says there
[1:41:52] is no
[1:41:53] condemnation to those that are in Christ
[1:41:56] Jesus so in other words there are a
[1:41:59] group of people that really was the
[1:42:03] purpose why Jesus came on the Earth
[1:42:06] and those people when they receive Jesus
[1:42:08] Christ They will receive the father part
[1:42:11] of him and there will be no need for
[1:42:14] them to come into the condemnation they
[1:42:18] will never come before the white Throne
[1:42:20] judgment there will never be asked for
[1:42:23] anything they did why because the blood
[1:42:26] of Jesus Christ atons for every sin they
[1:42:30] have ever made either turns for
[1:42:32] everything they have ever met
[1:42:35] they will be required to do only one
[1:42:37] thing they will be required only to
[1:42:39] believe
[1:42:40] that's why the theme of the of the
[1:42:43] minister for the bottom was only believe
[1:42:46] all things are possible
[1:42:48] the bride they are called The Bride they
[1:42:51] will be required only to believe but
[1:42:53] these other people who will receive an
[1:42:55] invitation to eternal life they will
[1:42:57] receive it they will accept it but they
[1:43:00] will go through the white Throne
[1:43:02] judgment
[1:43:03] and why because they missed the rapture
[1:43:07] the Rapture is the marriage of the Lamb
[1:43:09] hallelujah amen and the Bible says Amen
[1:43:12] Let us be glad let us rejoice and give
[1:43:16] honor to him why because the marriage of
[1:43:19] the Lamb is calm and his bride has made
[1:43:23] herself ready
[1:43:24] oh Hallelujah he said his wife has made
[1:43:28] herself ready are you his wife
[1:43:30] I am his wife I am his wife and the
[1:43:34] Bible says his wife has made herself
[1:43:36] ready listen I did not believe the
[1:43:38] message because I was fearing to go to
[1:43:40] hell I believe the message because I
[1:43:43] discovered I was more than just a
[1:43:45] believer I discovered that this message
[1:43:47] was calling me to come up higher the
[1:43:50] message was calling me to not only be a
[1:43:52] believer the message he was telling me
[1:43:54] that I was the wife of Jesus Christ
[1:44:00] if you see it this morning you'll be
[1:44:01] blessed now the Bible says here and to
[1:44:04] her was granted fine linen
[1:44:08] green and white
[1:44:10] for the final is like filthy rags before
[1:44:13] him so now we are talking about here the
[1:44:15] righteousness of Jesus Christ
[1:44:17] which is the word
[1:44:19] which is the word the revealed word of
[1:44:22] the hour in every age God has been
[1:44:24] revealing more of himself in every
[1:44:25] generation now the Rapture is the
[1:44:28] marriage of the Lamb the Rapture just
[1:44:30] like we read in the Book of Luke is the
[1:44:32] great supper
[1:44:34] and this supper amen he has invited amen
[1:44:38] those that were meant to come and I
[1:44:41] believe I am part of those that are
[1:44:42] going to go on that marriage supper of
[1:44:44] the Lamb
[1:44:45] amen and this will be for a space of
[1:44:48] three years and a half at that time they
[1:44:52] were there with tribulation on Earth
[1:44:54] and after the tribulation comes the
[1:44:56] Millennium so follow me here so now here
[1:44:58] right now where are we the word of God
[1:45:01] the inflation is being sent out to as
[1:45:03] many that shall receive it to to come to
[1:45:05] the marriage sapana and those who
[1:45:06] receive it
[1:45:07] we are waiting for one thing how many
[1:45:09] knows what we are waiting for
[1:45:11] the rapture
[1:45:16] the rapture we are waiting for the
[1:45:17] Rapture after the Rapture takes place
[1:45:20] the Earth will continue as it is
[1:45:23] continuing now but it will go into a
[1:45:26] Time called the Great Tribulation
[1:45:30] I don't want to explain it now I don't
[1:45:32] have time for it but then the Great
[1:45:34] Tribulation will will continue for a
[1:45:36] space of love and the Rapture which is
[1:45:39] the marriage type of the Lamb will also
[1:45:40] take place for a space of three years
[1:45:42] and a half so while the bride is in
[1:45:45] glory the the church the nominal Church
[1:45:47] those who had accepted Christ but they
[1:45:50] were not part of the bride and and all
[1:45:52] the others will live here on Earth and
[1:45:54] they will go through the tribulation
[1:45:56] some of those uh what the Bible calls
[1:45:58] the foolish virgins but there are many
[1:45:59] categories of people you know some of us
[1:46:02] would be the foolish virgins and they
[1:46:03] will stay here on Earth they will go
[1:46:05] through the tribulation while the bride
[1:46:07] is in glory with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:46:10] and at the same same time amen Christ
[1:46:13] will now go amen and visit the Jews
[1:46:16] during that time of the trip they will
[1:46:18] accept baptism in the name of our Lord
[1:46:20] Jesus Christ amen through there
[1:46:22] receiving their message while Israel is
[1:46:24] having a Revival the rest of the
[1:46:25] Gentiles will be in the Great
[1:46:27] Tribulation but I'm so glad the bride
[1:46:29] will be in the rapture
[1:46:31] hallelujah amen we will be together with
[1:46:34] the Lord we will not be here going
[1:46:36] through the sufferings amen that the
[1:46:38] others will be going through we shall be
[1:46:40] in glory and after three years and a
[1:46:43] half then comes the
[1:46:46] uh the the the Millennium now of course
[1:46:50] we will come down here to the Earth you
[1:46:52] know and we will be bound a thousand
[1:46:55] years we will have no time today and the
[1:46:58] law
[1:47:00] but you are now what is that time we are
[1:47:03] not talking about now we're talking
[1:47:04] about after the Rapture after the three
[1:47:07] years and a half after the tribulation
[1:47:09] when it's coming down at that time where
[1:47:11] is he going he is not going alone by the
[1:47:14] way he's coming back to this earth
[1:47:16] together we must says he was riding him
[1:47:19] in a White Horse and amen behind him was
[1:47:22] tens and tens of thousands of his Saints
[1:47:26] we were riding behind him where were we
[1:47:28] going we were coming down to the Earth
[1:47:30] to do what to rule together with him for
[1:47:34] a space of 1000 years
[1:47:37] that is called the Millennium I am going
[1:47:40] to be there in the Millennium amen we
[1:47:43] shall travel like a sword in the
[1:47:47] Millennium we shall have power to set
[1:47:48] things and things will happen in the
[1:47:51] Millennium amen the lion will be led by
[1:47:53] a little child what are you talking
[1:47:56] about in the Millennium we have gone
[1:47:58] back to our original God States like
[1:48:01] Adam was before the fall in the
[1:48:04] Millennium we are like God himself and
[1:48:07] we shall rule with him at that time
[1:48:09] Jesus Christ will be our husband of
[1:48:11] course and he will be having occupying
[1:48:14] the throne the seat Throne of David and
[1:48:17] so he will be called a son of David
[1:48:18] because he'll be the King of Kings and
[1:48:20] the Lord of lords and we will be his
[1:48:22] wife his bride
[1:48:24] praise God and then after the Millennium
[1:48:27] a thousand years there will come the
[1:48:30] the yeah that is and everything but then
[1:48:33] the major thing that comes after that
[1:48:36] is going to be the white Throne judgment
[1:48:39] now the Bible says and behold I saw a
[1:48:42] white throne
[1:48:44] follow me closely here this is some kind
[1:48:45] of teaching but I'm preaching this
[1:48:47] morning but I want you to follow me then
[1:48:49] I saw a white a great big white throne
[1:48:51] and there was one Saturn on it and now
[1:48:55] what was he going to do then the Bible
[1:48:57] says then the Dead
[1:48:59] this both small and great both rich and
[1:49:03] poor young and old they all rose up
[1:49:07] again from the dead let me tell you no
[1:49:10] one will stay in their graves
[1:49:13] no one whether they were swallowed that
[1:49:15] you need to do what to stand Before the
[1:49:18] Throne
[1:49:18] where is the bride at that time the
[1:49:21] bride is
[1:49:24] together with Jesus Christ
[1:49:27] at that time no we are not going to be
[1:49:29] judged
[1:49:31] the bride is not going to come into
[1:49:33] condemnation the bride is not going to
[1:49:35] come into judgment why because our
[1:49:37] judgment amen we go through it right
[1:49:40] here on Earth is why we preach as
[1:49:42] coaching message to condemn you to
[1:49:45] convict you so that you can repent of
[1:49:47] your sins amen and be set free so that
[1:49:51] on that day come on
[1:49:53] oh my and then after the white Throne
[1:49:55] judgment then there will come a new
[1:49:58] Heaven and a new Earth and there are
[1:50:00] many other things that I've not talked
[1:50:01] about I'm not going through the order
[1:50:03] but I want you to see here in the Book
[1:50:05] of Revelation chapter 20 if you can
[1:50:08] read with me
[1:50:10] verses 5.
[1:50:12] but the rest of the Dead live the north
[1:50:15] again until the thousand years were
[1:50:19] finished
[1:50:20] hmm
[1:50:22] this is the first resurrection blessed
[1:50:25] and holy is he that has part in the
[1:50:27] First Resurrection on such the second
[1:50:29] death has no power but they shall be
[1:50:32] Priests of God and of Christ and shall
[1:50:34] reign with him a thousand years so now
[1:50:36] the Bible here gives us a little more
[1:50:39] information he says the rest of the Dead
[1:50:41] live not until a thousand years we are
[1:50:43] finished now here he is speaking of the
[1:50:45] Millennium he is speaking of a thousand
[1:50:48] years halfway living on Earth that we
[1:50:50] left here on Earth the Bible says the
[1:50:52] rest of the Dead live do not they did
[1:50:54] not leave until the Millennium was
[1:50:57] finished is the rapture
[1:51:00] the fast Resurrection is the rapture and
[1:51:03] we are that is our Target that is our
[1:51:05] goal and he says blessed and the holy is
[1:51:09] he that has part in the first
[1:51:11] resurrection
[1:51:12] now the Bible does not say you are only
[1:51:15] blessed because you are part of the
[1:51:16] first resurrection the Bible says you
[1:51:19] are blessed and You Are Holy
[1:51:23] how can he that is Holy be judged no
[1:51:26] because we are blessed and we Are Holy
[1:51:29] Holy not by our own Works Holy by his
[1:51:32] own the Bible says blessed and holy is
[1:51:35] he that has part in the first
[1:51:37] resurrection oh my I am going to be part
[1:51:39] of the first resurrection do you believe
[1:51:41] it are you going to be part of the first
[1:51:43] resurrection
[1:51:45] oh my
[1:51:46] on search on who on those who will have
[1:51:49] pattern of the first resurrection
[1:51:51] the second death has no power
[1:51:54] so now we are we are now getting new ads
[1:51:57] here first death second death fast
[1:51:59] Resurrection second Resurrection now the
[1:52:02] first death is what everybody dies
[1:52:04] everybody dies and they go to the Grave
[1:52:06] that is just death death of the body but
[1:52:08] the second death is the death and
[1:52:10] destruction of the Soul
[1:52:17] I'm telling you certain things maybe
[1:52:18] some of you did not know so you need to
[1:52:20] listen carefully
[1:52:21] you know it says that there's nothing
[1:52:23] like Eternal hair you know Eternal hair
[1:52:25] is a hell which has no end and the
[1:52:29] denominations all over the world teach
[1:52:31] that there is uh going to be an eternal
[1:52:34] hell without beginning without end but
[1:52:37] our Prophet told us that everything that
[1:52:39] has in Hell have a beginning by the way
[1:52:42] the Bible says hell was created for the
[1:52:45] devil and his angels so if hell will
[1:52:47] help because if the people are going to
[1:52:49] live in hell for eternity it means they
[1:52:51] have eternal life like us who are going
[1:52:52] to believe in eternal life
[1:52:54] you see so they will also have eternal
[1:52:56] life in another big confused be confused
[1:52:59] to say we are going to have eternal life
[1:53:00] in heaven and they are going to have
[1:53:02] eternal life in hell and that means
[1:53:03] they're also having eternal life is only
[1:53:05] the place which is the difference
[1:53:07] but the truth is hell is not going to be
[1:53:10] a tunnel hell is going to be a season
[1:53:12] and Seasons that brother says it might
[1:53:15] be a million years it might be a very
[1:53:17] long time I don't know but it will
[1:53:19] eventually come to an end and then in
[1:53:22] the new Heaven and the new Earth there
[1:53:24] won't be held
[1:53:26] praise God and the devil will be thrown
[1:53:28] into the Lake of Fire and and all the
[1:53:30] others who did not believe but you see
[1:53:32] that is the second death all the souls
[1:53:35] of those who refuse to believe the
[1:53:36] message who refuse to you know to accept
[1:53:38] Christ who refuse him and the invitation
[1:53:41] they were thrown into the second death
[1:53:44] the Bible says but he that comes in the
[1:53:47] first resurrection on such the second
[1:53:50] death has no power now
[1:53:52] I've heard many people who say even if I
[1:53:55] am not the bride and I don't come
[1:53:57] through the first resurrection
[1:53:59] I will come through the second
[1:54:00] Resurrection which is going to stand
[1:54:02] before the white throne and I will be
[1:54:04] the foolish virgin and I will eventually
[1:54:05] get eternal life let me tell me before
[1:54:08] the white throne we have no guarantee
[1:54:10] you have no guarantee that you will have
[1:54:12] eternal life there no guarantee
[1:54:14] absolutely why because it is a hundred
[1:54:17] percent based on him and his decision
[1:54:19] according to your works so now the Bible
[1:54:22] says the ones who come in the first
[1:54:25] resurrection the second death has no
[1:54:28] power meaning the ones who are coming
[1:54:30] through the second Resurrection the
[1:54:33] second I mean
[1:54:34] actually they are all supposed to be
[1:54:36] condemned even you Among Us the one who
[1:54:39] feels is holier than everybody else
[1:54:40] right now in your state when you come
[1:54:42] before that weight Throne judgment you
[1:54:45] will be condemned as a sinner
[1:54:47] you will be condemned and by the bottom
[1:54:49] to spoke about that many times
[1:54:51] you will be condemned there is no way
[1:54:53] you can go through that judgment no
[1:54:56] human being can be able to go through
[1:54:58] that judgment and therefore those who
[1:55:00] are going to go through it it will not
[1:55:02] be based on their righteousness or what
[1:55:04] they have done that is good it will be
[1:55:06] best on him
[1:55:07] according to their works the Bible says
[1:55:10] the righteous unfair judge so he will
[1:55:13] judge them and he Sam he will give life
[1:55:15] and others he will condem and they will
[1:55:17] go into the second death
[1:55:18] I don't want to to play Lottery with my
[1:55:22] life I want to go to a deal and my sure
[1:55:26] deal here is being in the first
[1:55:28] resurrection if I'm in the first
[1:55:30] resurrection I am sure of this one thing
[1:55:32] brother Marvin that the second death has
[1:55:34] no power on me
[1:55:36] I am dead Once In Christ and my life the
[1:55:39] life that I live is not my life it is
[1:55:41] the life of Jesus Christ
[1:55:44] and I am sure the second death has no
[1:55:47] power on me
[1:55:49] and the Bible says they are priests of
[1:55:51] God and of Christ and they shall reign
[1:55:53] with him a thousand years and those are
[1:55:55] the ones going in the Rapture now in
[1:55:57] First Peter chapter two I'm just giving
[1:55:58] away the foundation here to be able to
[1:56:00] go in Luke 14. First Peter chapter 2
[1:56:02] verse 9 he says but he him who has
[1:56:04] called you out of Darkness Into His
[1:56:07] Marvelous Light
[1:56:09] which in time passed away another people
[1:56:11] but are now the people of God which had
[1:56:15] not ordained Mercy but now have obtained
[1:56:18] Mercy the Bible says those people and I
[1:56:20] believe I am greater generation he had a
[1:56:23] special group of people that he called
[1:56:25] peculiar he called important
[1:56:28] and thus he is so jealous over them and
[1:56:32] those he wants them to go in the Rapture
[1:56:34] and those he doesn't want them to come
[1:56:36] into condemnation and because of that
[1:56:38] special message
[1:56:42] and this message is different from the
[1:56:46] gospel that they preach the gospel that
[1:56:49] they preach is only meant
[1:56:53] to bring them
[1:56:54] into life or you can call it salvation
[1:56:58] but I'm not we are here
[1:57:01] for
[1:57:02] something more than salvation
[1:57:06] if you understand it many people are
[1:57:08] going to be saved brother Fred but not
[1:57:11] all that are saved will be the bride
[1:57:16] if you understand it say Amen
[1:57:19] I realize what I'm preaching today some
[1:57:22] people may be confused a bit if you're
[1:57:23] confused come to me after service so I
[1:57:25] can listen to the service again and
[1:57:26] again and read the scriptures yourself
[1:57:28] you'll get it but listen to me
[1:57:30] this message
[1:57:32] is not only for the Salvation of our
[1:57:36] souls many people are going to be saved
[1:57:39] but not all will go in the rapture
[1:57:42] did you think that the foolish virgins
[1:57:43] are going to be lost
[1:57:47] yes
[1:57:49] yes
[1:57:50] how can they be lost when they are
[1:57:52] virgins
[1:57:53] how can a virgin virgin means they are
[1:57:57] righteous
[1:57:58] the the the the the Christ right but
[1:58:02] they were foolish they didn't have what
[1:58:04] it took to be the bride
[1:58:06] and the bride is also predestinated
[1:58:09] before the foundation of the world
[1:58:14] so for you to be the bride there is
[1:58:16] nothing you do to be the bride that is
[1:58:18] only one thing
[1:58:20] for you to be who you are to believe the
[1:58:22] word of the bridegroom
[1:58:24] when you believe the word of the
[1:58:26] bridegroom that is
[1:58:28] that is the absolute you know the wise
[1:58:32] virgins had that oil the extra oil and
[1:58:35] and he says they say the proof that you
[1:58:37] have the Holy Ghost is not speaking in
[1:58:39] tongues it's not jumping up and down
[1:58:41] it's not shouting it's not excitement
[1:58:42] although that is a part of it but the
[1:58:44] proof that you have filled with the Holy
[1:58:46] Ghost is by receiving the word of your
[1:58:48] day you know why because if you receive
[1:58:51] the word of your day you cannot receive
[1:58:53] the word of your day unless you are the
[1:58:55] bride
[1:58:56] and if you receive the word of your day
[1:58:58] you will live the life
[1:59:03] now this class of of those in the first
[1:59:06] resurrection is a special class these do
[1:59:08] not go into eternal life on their own
[1:59:10] merits these enter in solidly on the
[1:59:13] basis of his Mercy through his blood oh
[1:59:16] hallelujah thank you Jesus they are more
[1:59:19] than just salvation they are more than
[1:59:22] just eternal life they go to the
[1:59:25] marriage supper the others don't go
[1:59:27] there but this way our royalty
[1:59:32] is that a man
[1:59:34] so if you want to it's not just oh my
[1:59:37] God
[1:59:38] it's not just intended to bring us into
[1:59:40] the king's presence or his purpose is
[1:59:44] not just to make us have a little
[1:59:46] encounter with the King there are many
[1:59:49] women that have an encounter with the
[1:59:51] King but it stopped there they never
[1:59:54] ever came so our purpose is not passes
[1:59:57] to stay in his presence
[2:00:00] Esther was the Queen Esther became the
[2:00:02] queen our purpose is to become the queen
[2:00:06] all these girls who came before the king
[2:00:09] and the King just them away what happens
[2:00:12] so there are many going to remain in the
[2:00:15] palace many are going to go to heaven
[2:00:18] men are going to do what
[2:00:20] to go to heaven but they will not be the
[2:00:22] bride they will not be the wife of the
[2:00:25] king many remained in the palace go read
[2:00:28] the book of Esther many remain in the
[2:00:29] palace whatever they needed the king
[2:00:33] gave them
[2:00:34] gifts the king gave them and they gave
[2:00:37] them special houses but you see there is
[2:00:39] this special one
[2:00:41] for her she was not just thrown of the
[2:00:43] Kingdom
[2:00:45] now I want you to look at Revelation 3
[2:00:47] 21.
[2:00:51] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[2:00:54] sit with me in my throne even as I sat
[2:00:57] down in my father's Throne he
[2:00:59] has an ear let him
[2:01:02] let him Church
[2:01:04] hear what the spirit says unto the
[2:01:07] churches so to him that over what is in
[2:01:11] every Church age let me let me give you
[2:01:14] a little more background here we have
[2:01:16] seven Church ages seven Church edges now
[2:01:20] of course
[2:01:21] um
[2:01:22] sometimes when I'm preaching I just go
[2:01:25] over it but let me take a moment to
[2:01:26] explain or expound this for you a little
[2:01:28] bit
[2:01:29] when you look at the book of Roman later
[2:01:32] if you look at Romans chapter 11
[2:01:35] he explains the difference between the
[2:01:38] Church of the Jews and the Church of the
[2:01:41] Gentiles now the Jews
[2:01:44] were the original brand bride now the
[2:01:48] Bible says the the the Jews will be
[2:01:50] restored
[2:01:51] but the Jews will not be restored I I
[2:01:55] spoke a little bit about the 70 weeks of
[2:01:57] Daniel you know God showed Daniel how
[2:02:00] long God would work with the Jews until
[2:02:02] the Millennium by the way until the
[2:02:04] Millennium you know he showed them 70
[2:02:06] weeks 70 weeks of years meaning each
[2:02:08] week was how many years
[2:02:12] yes seven years and so so now in the
[2:02:15] last week of the of the 70 weeks the
[2:02:19] Messiah was cut off
[2:02:21] follow me closely here now put on your
[2:02:23] spiritual thinking cap in those last
[2:02:25] seven years last week
[2:02:27] three years and a half do you understand
[2:02:29] that brother Enoch
[2:02:30] three years and a half the Jews are
[2:02:32] remaining with three years and a half
[2:02:34] counting when they did stop counting it
[2:02:37] stopped counting when the Messiah Jesus
[2:02:40] Christ was killed on the cross
[2:02:42] are you following me Church
[2:02:44] when the when the when the Messiah was
[2:02:46] killed when he was cut off the the time
[2:02:49] of the Jews stopped counting it was
[2:02:53] paused so God stopped working with them
[2:02:56] until now I've met several Jews but Jews
[2:03:00] don't believe in the Messiah Jews many
[2:03:01] of them don't even believe in God
[2:03:04] they are blinded in Romans 11 he says
[2:03:06] they are blinded for what for what sake
[2:03:08] for your sake the Gentiles
[2:03:12] you see how long are they going to be
[2:03:14] blinded
[2:03:17] how long are they going to be blinded
[2:03:19] they are going to be blinded for until
[2:03:22] the times of the Gentiles come to their
[2:03:25] fullness so let us say that this was the
[2:03:29] time when they were blinded
[2:03:31] when Jesus Christ was you know killed
[2:03:34] and then when it rose again
[2:03:35] from the moment he rose again the
[2:03:37] disciples started preaching and where
[2:03:40] were they preaching to to the Gentiles
[2:03:43] Paul became the Apostle to the Gentiles
[2:03:45] and when he laid that Foundation to the
[2:03:48] Gentiles time of the Gentiles started
[2:03:50] counting we started
[2:03:52] the teaching on the seven Church ages
[2:03:56] if you if you don't have a message as a
[2:03:59] church edge book please find one brother
[2:04:01] Marvin
[2:04:02] you know raise up your hand this is
[2:04:05] brother Marvin if you want to church
[2:04:06] each book contacted he'll get you one
[2:04:08] started that church edge book it will
[2:04:10] show you you know the time of the
[2:04:12] Gentile space of seven Church agents are
[2:04:16] you following me
[2:04:18] quickly go to Revelation I didn't plan
[2:04:20] this but let me just show you to you for
[2:04:21] just a few moments
[2:04:25] uh Revelation chapter 1 are you there if
[2:04:29] you're there Say Amen
[2:04:30] are you there
[2:04:32] all right so
[2:04:35] saying
[2:04:36] I am verse 11 I am the Alpha and Omega
[2:04:39] the first one which are in Asia and
[2:04:40] Anthony
[2:04:45] Philadelphia and and to Lord this year
[2:04:49] now
[2:04:51] these churches were in Asia
[2:04:55] being the gospel the invitation has been
[2:04:57] said
[2:04:59] that's what we are receiving today and
[2:05:01] so you notice that it started here with
[2:05:03] Apostle Paul and he started counting how
[2:05:05] many generations one two three four five
[2:05:10] six seven
[2:05:12] when it religious seven you know seven
[2:05:14] is completion
[2:05:15] when it religious seven the times of the
[2:05:19] Gentiles will be fully
[2:05:21] Hallelujah finished it would have been
[2:05:24] completed do you know where we are are
[2:05:27] we on two are we on three are we on six
[2:05:31] where are we seven
[2:05:34] we have reached the end of the gentle
[2:05:37] dispensation
[2:05:40] and right here right here the Bible now
[2:05:43] gives a promise Hallelujah in every
[2:05:46] Church age he was giving a promise to
[2:05:48] the Overcomers and let me tell you who
[2:05:50] were the Overcomers in every age the
[2:05:53] Overcomers in every age we are those who
[2:05:55] receive the word of their messenger
[2:05:59] and now when he reaches to the end the
[2:06:03] last Church age he has this to say to
[2:06:06] him that overcometh will I grant to sit
[2:06:09] with me in my throne
[2:06:12] hey Hallelujah the promise to the last
[2:06:17] Gentile bride is the throne
[2:06:21] tell your neighbor the throne
[2:06:23] the throne my brother the throne
[2:06:26] that is our promise
[2:06:29] our promise is not just not to go to
[2:06:31] heaven he didn't say oh to the
[2:06:32] Overcomers I'll let them have it on life
[2:06:34] no more than eternal life more than
[2:06:38] eternal life
[2:06:39] eternal life is a must
[2:06:41] amen why because we have accepted Christ
[2:06:44] but here he's giving us more than
[2:06:47] salvation he's giving us a throne
[2:06:53] my goodness
[2:06:55] the bride of Christ will hear if every
[2:06:57] word and submit every word she will
[2:07:00] overcome unbelief
[2:07:02] she will believe every word amen God has
[2:07:05] sent seven minutes what are we doing
[2:07:07] finding the last one
[2:07:09] because their message is mandated to
[2:07:11] find the bride in every age this message
[2:07:14] is supposed to find the bride in every
[2:07:16] age how by those who have eaten it they
[2:07:19] will have a burden for the souls out
[2:07:21] there not just for them to know Christ
[2:07:23] and that's it but for them to become a
[2:07:26] father part of Christ to become a part
[2:07:28] of him to become Amen to become his wife
[2:07:31] their purpose is to go find the bride in
[2:07:34] every Age The Bride in every age will
[2:07:35] hear not only here but believe and not
[2:07:39] only believe but at work in a message of
[2:07:42] their day that message you will prepare
[2:07:44] them for the rapture
[2:07:46] and this message is preparing us for the
[2:07:48] rapture that is what makes us different
[2:07:51] I say that is what makes us different
[2:07:53] from the other denominations why because
[2:07:56] we have a message they don't have a
[2:07:58] message
[2:07:59] am I preaching to someone they don't
[2:08:01] have a prophet we have a prophet
[2:08:05] we have a messenger and we have a
[2:08:07] message and this message is preparing us
[2:08:10] for
[2:08:11] the rapture
[2:08:14] Hallelujah
[2:08:15] Hallelujah
[2:08:17] oh I'm thinking of the Rapture in our
[2:08:20] blessed home on High when the redeem the
[2:08:22] Gathering in oh Hallelujah be among the
[2:08:26] saints I'll be in that number one of
[2:08:28] them one of them I'm so glad I can say
[2:08:31] I'm one of them there are people almost
[2:08:33] everywhere baptized in his name why are
[2:08:36] we saying we are one of them because we
[2:08:37] have received a revelation amen we have
[2:08:40] a revelation bubbling in our souls we
[2:08:43] are one of those going in a rapture
[2:08:47] Hallelujah
[2:08:49] hey man and we are not going to go on
[2:08:51] the Rapture based on how good we are yes
[2:08:54] we are going to be good but not by our
[2:08:56] in ourselves we are going to be good
[2:08:58] according to his word we are going to
[2:09:00] receive every word amen the Bride is a
[2:09:04] sheep of his flock
[2:09:06] amen whenever the word is preached the
[2:09:09] ship
[2:09:09] says bad
[2:09:12] Hallelujah
[2:09:13] whenever the word is preached the script
[2:09:15] says Ah man
[2:09:18] amen I believe the word I mean why you
[2:09:22] will not you know some people who are
[2:09:23] not the body if you go and preach the
[2:09:25] things we preach here in other churches
[2:09:26] people will be
[2:09:28] selecting
[2:09:30] that one amen
[2:09:32] that one
[2:09:34] that is too much
[2:09:36] women should not wear trousers
[2:09:38] it is too judgmental I don't want to be
[2:09:41] judged don't worry there is another
[2:09:43] judgment for you but those ones who
[2:09:45] accept it say Amen I'm judged oh God
[2:09:48] help me let me change it yeah your
[2:09:50] judgment is here amen you know you know
[2:09:54] let fornication not be named among you
[2:09:56] some people are there
[2:09:59] [Music]
[2:10:01] but the bride will say amen amen amen
[2:10:04] why because their judgment is
[2:10:08] you know the message will make you you
[2:10:10] know by saying Amen to the word by
[2:10:12] receiving the word amen the spirit of
[2:10:14] God will come amen amen by your amen and
[2:10:16] make you live that word the life of the
[2:10:19] world will just come down through your
[2:10:20] heart amen it will first amen your body
[2:10:23] it will force amen you are understanding
[2:10:25] to submit Hallelujah to submit it to the
[2:10:29] word even when you have no power of your
[2:10:32] own something inside of you will force
[2:10:35] you to submit to that word hallelujah
[2:10:38] that is what makes us different from the
[2:10:40] denominations because the denominations
[2:10:42] are preaching us also gospel
[2:10:44] they are preaching a gospel
[2:10:46] which they say oh we believe we are
[2:10:48] saved by the grace of God
[2:10:50] you know we are going to heaven yeah
[2:10:51] they are going to heaven I may not doubt
[2:10:52] that that much although I don't know I
[2:10:54] have no Surety but what I know they may
[2:10:56] go but all I know all I know I am the
[2:11:00] bride
[2:11:01] I am the bride why because I've received
[2:11:03] the heaven whack every word
[2:11:07] vashti let me tell you about vashti
[2:11:10] vashti was the queen
[2:11:12] the denominations they had that ability
[2:11:15] of being the Queen the potential because
[2:11:17] they had accepted the word and the word
[2:11:19] is the seed so vashti was the queen but
[2:11:22] what the modern version
[2:11:24] what removed her from her place
[2:11:27] you never touch age you would say or
[2:11:29] else I will come at you if you don't
[2:11:31] believe or else I'll come quickly and
[2:11:32] I'll remove the Candlestick he said what
[2:11:34] made
[2:11:34] virtually be removed from her place
[2:11:37] unbelief
[2:11:38] the king said bring her call her to come
[2:11:41] and she said no
[2:11:44] she said no instead of saying amen but
[2:11:47] the bride says Ah man ah man whatever
[2:11:51] the word of God says you say Amen you
[2:11:54] don't reason with it you don't debate
[2:11:56] with the word you only say ah man I
[2:11:59] believe it so be it according to your
[2:12:02] word
[2:12:04] I don't have the power to do it but amen
[2:12:08] it is your word so so be it I receive it
[2:12:11] I accept it let it live in me
[2:12:15] that is what makes the difference we
[2:12:17] believe every word cover to cover cover
[2:12:19] to cover to cover
[2:12:21] we believe it all
[2:12:23] we don't choose what we want we accept
[2:12:25] everything in here to be thus saith the
[2:12:28] Lord
[2:12:30] Hallelujah
[2:12:32] people have taken the words of brother
[2:12:34] but I'm a prophet of this message of
[2:12:36] this generation and they pick some words
[2:12:38] by the way all preachers do it all
[2:12:40] preachers and a few bold ones have come
[2:12:42] out and spoken openly they didn't say
[2:12:45] you know we read the message of brother
[2:12:46] Bannerman most of the things we do we
[2:12:48] are trying to copy him and the things
[2:12:49] we're trying to teach we're trying to
[2:12:50] copy from his message no they don't say
[2:12:51] like that but they say you know one of
[2:12:55] them was saying you know William Branham
[2:12:56] a mighty man of God a pillow came
[2:12:59] so you know all that information how did
[2:13:02] you get it you are studying his message
[2:13:04] you are stealing from his message and
[2:13:07] you are preaching to your people a
[2:13:08] little here a little there and you you
[2:13:10] don't have the guts or the strength to
[2:13:12] tell them everything but they are
[2:13:14] Hallelujah there are people who are
[2:13:16] already receiving everything
[2:13:18] amen who are going to be identified with
[2:13:22] the messenger of their generation we are
[2:13:25] going to eat all the book everything in
[2:13:27] the book
[2:13:29] Hallelujah and we are not ashamed to
[2:13:32] identify ourselves with the message if
[2:13:34] you are ashamed you can suit yourself as
[2:13:36] far as I'm concerned I am not ashamed
[2:13:38] even where I go in Ethiopia I have been
[2:13:41] telling people look William Marion
[2:13:43] Branham is the messenger of Our
[2:13:46] Generation
[2:13:48] and I met this preacher 32 years
[2:13:50] preaching 32 years
[2:13:52] at my age he's been preaching the whole
[2:13:54] time I've lived
[2:13:55] old man and his ear he asked me a
[2:13:58] question he said how everything you're
[2:14:00] saying is right but how do I know that
[2:14:02] William Branham is the one who is this
[2:14:04] messenger yeah I clearly see there is a
[2:14:06] messenger an Elijah supposed to come in
[2:14:08] the last days but how do I notice
[2:14:09] William brother I also asked him how do
[2:14:11] you know that the Messiah was the
[2:14:12] Messiah
[2:14:13] do you know that Messiah was rejected by
[2:14:16] people who knew the prophecy but who did
[2:14:18] not believe it was Jesus
[2:14:20] so knowing the word does not mean you
[2:14:22] believe the word
[2:14:24] you know but you say text Revelation for
[2:14:27] you to believe the word and that
[2:14:28] reversion comes from God you know how
[2:14:31] did they know I told him they knew that
[2:14:33] he was the Messiah by their by his Works
[2:14:36] he said if you don't believe my words at
[2:14:39] least see the things I'm doing and see
[2:14:40] that this is why that which is written
[2:14:41] of me
[2:14:42] same thing to John the Baptist they
[2:14:44] didn't believe him but when they asked
[2:14:46] him who are you he said I am the voice
[2:14:48] crying from the Wilderness prepare you
[2:14:49] the way of the Lord so he was trying to
[2:14:51] say see am I not doing what was written
[2:14:53] about me so how do you know that William
[2:14:55] Branham is the messenger of the last
[2:14:57] generation called Lord this year is
[2:14:59] because his ministry did what the Bible
[2:15:01] said he would do the Bible says in the
[2:15:04] Book of Matthew
[2:15:05] that Elijah when he comes he shall
[2:15:08] restore all things and all the teachings
[2:15:11] of the word have been restored back to
[2:15:13] the church baptism in Jesus in the name
[2:15:15] of our Lord Jesus Christ you know one
[2:15:17] God that has been restored you know
[2:15:19] about the ministry you know women not
[2:15:21] being pastors or preachers or Bishops or
[2:15:24] things like that according to the
[2:15:25] Scriptures it has been restored the
[2:15:27] operation of the gifts in their right
[2:15:28] way has been restored and many other
[2:15:30] things according to Revelation 10 7 he
[2:15:32] says he will finish the mystery of God
[2:15:34] and the Mystery on the seven series on
[2:15:36] the church ages on the all these things
[2:15:38] have been revealed why that proves his
[2:15:40] ministry as the Elijah of Our Generation
[2:15:43] no man can be able to say it is not and
[2:15:47] no other Ministry can be able to raise
[2:15:48] up and say oh no I'm the one why because
[2:15:50] they are Ministry proves otherwise
[2:15:54] praise God
[2:15:56] and we thank God to receive this message
[2:15:59] this messenger is preparing us for the
[2:16:01] for the coming of the Lord
[2:16:03] in the message the comfort of brother
[2:16:04] says God help me God help you as
[2:16:07] Christians never to compromise one word
[2:16:09] of God's word for this sacred trust has
[2:16:11] handed was handed to the church and it's
[2:16:15] a glorious thing to have this gospel the
[2:16:16] Full Gospel to preach it without
[2:16:18] compromising anywhere preach it just as
[2:16:21] it is written leave it just as it is
[2:16:23] written what a sacred Trust
[2:16:26] and if we ever expect this word to ever
[2:16:29] come to pass if we ever expect God to
[2:16:31] keep his word we've got to stay with it
[2:16:34] just the way God wrote it
[2:16:37] that's the reason if you stay with with
[2:16:39] it the way God wrote it there will be
[2:16:41] all kinds of things happening among you
[2:16:44] every word will be fulfilled
[2:16:47] hmm
[2:16:49] if we stay with the word the word has
[2:16:51] been written things will be happening
[2:16:53] miracles signs and wonders powerful
[2:16:55] things will be happening in our midst
[2:16:57] why because God will fulfill everyone
[2:16:59] that is written Among Us
[2:17:01] and he says I am my other expectations
[2:17:03] just now myself of seeing a shaking
[2:17:06] power come that will shake the Nations
[2:17:08] pretty soon God can can never ever get a
[2:17:12] people under his own God can can ever
[2:17:14] get a people under his own control if
[2:17:17] it's if you get a man or a woman that
[2:17:19] won't compromise on his word but he will
[2:17:21] but he will stand there like the Rock of
[2:17:24] Ages
[2:17:25] are you that man or that woman that will
[2:17:27] stand there not compromising on any word
[2:17:30] that will believe every word of it and
[2:17:33] believe that he is behind it who is
[2:17:35] behind it
[2:17:36] God and a man who believes it you must
[2:17:39] act like it tell your neighbor you must
[2:17:42] act like it
[2:17:45] you must act like it if you don't act
[2:17:48] like it then you don't believe it hey
[2:17:54] act like it and you can put it to work
[2:17:57] and the word will be in you
[2:18:02] so to those of you who are not married
[2:18:05] and you are seeking for wives Brothers
[2:18:09] and you are seeking for a wife but the
[2:18:12] question is do you believe everyone
[2:18:14] if you doubt the word if you debate with
[2:18:16] the word it will not happen
[2:18:18] God is under no obligation to fulfill
[2:18:20] his word in your life but if you take
[2:18:22] your ground and you like the Rock of
[2:18:23] Ages and say I believe the word I am not
[2:18:27] going to go with those prostitutes or
[2:18:28] with those you know you know you know
[2:18:31] girls out there in the world I'm not
[2:18:32] going to go with with those chorus girls
[2:18:34] I'm going to marry a holy ghost-filled
[2:18:37] Child of God
[2:18:38] if you make that stand and you make it
[2:18:41] as your stand you stand there as a Rock
[2:18:42] of Ages you believe that with all your
[2:18:44] heart then God is obligated to make that
[2:18:47] word come true in your life
[2:18:49] praise God
[2:18:52] Pastor Marcus has quite a few young men
[2:18:54] maybe I don't know maybe like seven or
[2:18:56] ten who are not married yet and I was
[2:18:58] telling him that
[2:19:00] these young men need to get married he
[2:19:02] said oh yes but we don't have sisters in
[2:19:03] the church here now I reminded him I
[2:19:05] said oh are you telling me that are you
[2:19:08] telling me that and I reminded him of
[2:19:10] his testimony you know they were the
[2:19:12] first Believers in the country and you
[2:19:13] know we're having no Believers
[2:19:15] absolutely nobody nobody was a Believer
[2:19:17] you know you have about three four you
[2:19:21] have let's say I don't remember how many
[2:19:22] in the world said maybe four younger men
[2:19:24] and four young ladies about two young
[2:19:27] ladies and four younger men and these
[2:19:29] younger men don't want to marry these
[2:19:30] young ladies they they feel they are not
[2:19:32] theirs and then they all want to get
[2:19:36] married
[2:19:37] so what do they do
[2:19:39] and they know according to the message
[2:19:40] they're not going to marry the
[2:19:41] unbelievers so they had to take their
[2:19:44] stand I went in my office at that time
[2:19:47] in Ethiopia and I thought I said God
[2:19:50] this is your word I believe it it's a
[2:19:52] prophet of this generation he says under
[2:19:54] no circumstance should believe as mother
[2:19:56] and unbelievers so what am I going to do
[2:19:58] because it appears there is an exception
[2:20:01] here I was speaking to the Lord in my
[2:20:03] heart about these things
[2:20:05] it appears there is an exception here
[2:20:07] these people they are of all believe the
[2:20:09] message
[2:20:10] but in the whole country of more than
[2:20:13] 100 million people they are not
[2:20:15] Believers like them
[2:20:16] so Lord I believe this is an exception
[2:20:19] and then I had a voice speak to me
[2:20:22] under no circumstance should believe my
[2:20:23] mother and I believe I said
[2:20:26] why is it echoing back to my mind this
[2:20:28] should be the Lord telling me my word is
[2:20:30] my word and is already settled in heaven
[2:20:32] so when I went out of that office I was
[2:20:35] because I had not preached that in the
[2:20:36] church yet I I needed to know what to
[2:20:39] preach to the people and to teach them
[2:20:40] what you are teaching them is what they
[2:20:41] will become so if I was going to tell
[2:20:43] them well there's an exception you know
[2:20:45] you can that's what would have become
[2:20:47] but you know I laid it down the way it
[2:20:49] is it is God's word I believe is the
[2:20:51] message of Our Generation he said it
[2:20:53] even the Bible says you know you know
[2:20:55] you should not York together with the
[2:20:56] non-believers so I laid it down for them
[2:20:58] and I told them God is obligated to
[2:21:01] stand behind his word
[2:21:02] each time his word is believed God is
[2:21:05] obligated to stand behind that word
[2:21:15] so I told them God is obligated to stand
[2:21:18] behind that word and uh and and then one
[2:21:22] by one began to receive Revelation they
[2:21:24] believed it by the way they accepted it
[2:21:25] all those people all those people the
[2:21:27] youngest was Ephraim brother Ephraim who
[2:21:30] was about 18 at that time or 17 and now
[2:21:35] he's 23 21 but he's married he was the
[2:21:38] youngest among them
[2:21:39] so I'm telling you that God will fulfill
[2:21:42] his word among the eldest and the
[2:21:44] youngest as long as you stand with this
[2:21:46] word Like a Rock of Ages you stand on it
[2:21:48] you stand on it you don't compromise
[2:21:50] with it I bet God will stand behind that
[2:21:53] word to prove to you this is my word and
[2:21:55] I am God I fail not
[2:21:59] I fell not
[2:22:01] Hallelujah
[2:22:03] and even in our church here by that
[2:22:05] there are some younger men several of
[2:22:06] them maybe three maybe four I don't know
[2:22:08] who are been standing on the word and
[2:22:10] they are soon going to get married so we
[2:22:12] are going to have weddings here very
[2:22:13] soon
[2:22:14] Hallelujah yes I'm telling you we are
[2:22:17] going to have weddings if not this year
[2:22:19] this coming year we are going to have
[2:22:20] like four weddings that is a spoken word
[2:22:23] believe it Hallelujah
[2:22:26] yes if you stand with the word God is
[2:22:29] obligated to fulfill it
[2:22:32] don't compromise don't compromise don't
[2:22:36] go for something else take the counsel
[2:22:38] of God
[2:22:41] praise God
[2:22:44] now when he told them
[2:22:47] and I'll be
[2:22:49] uh maybe I'll continue with my message
[2:22:51] on Sunday but let me on Wednesday but
[2:22:53] let me go a little more here in the Book
[2:22:56] of Luke 14 8 where we read he says and
[2:22:58] they all with one our consent began to
[2:23:00] make excuse the first said unto him I
[2:23:03] have bought a piece of ground I have I I
[2:23:06] want to go say it I and then another one
[2:23:08] you know they all began to give excuses
[2:23:10] I have an oxy and I have to go prove it
[2:23:13] I have you know a murder wife I want to
[2:23:15] you know and then if I cannot come
[2:23:18] deliberately began to turn away the Holy
[2:23:21] Ghost
[2:23:22] now let me tell you this message which
[2:23:23] we have received is the Holy Ghost we
[2:23:25] sing it and say it is the Holy Ghost and
[2:23:29] power it is keeping me alive this
[2:23:31] message is the Holy Ghost and power is
[2:23:33] keeping us alive not in itself but the
[2:23:36] power and the Holy Ghost comes with it
[2:23:38] and then he says here in the message is
[2:23:41] your life worthy of the Gospel by the
[2:23:43] way this message is your life worthy of
[2:23:45] the Gospel I recommend it to all you
[2:23:48] Brethren to go and listen to it I wish
[2:23:50] you would go and listen to it is your
[2:23:52] life worthy of the Gospel 6306 30.
[2:23:54] please go and listen to it he says when
[2:23:56] God sends the Holy Ghost and knocks at a
[2:23:58] man's door
[2:24:00] and he deliberately turns it down
[2:24:03] sometime he's going to turn it for his
[2:24:07] last time
[2:24:08] and then you won't be a privileged
[2:24:11] character
[2:24:12] you can sit in church and listen to the
[2:24:15] gospel and agree with the gospel you
[2:24:17] might do so much and say I know it is
[2:24:20] right but never put a thing on it to
[2:24:23] help it yourself you just you just
[2:24:25] listen to it because you say I believe
[2:24:26] it's all right that you are just
[2:24:28] sympathizing with it
[2:24:30] we have many people like that they come
[2:24:32] you know they turn down the word they
[2:24:34] turn down the Holy Ghost but they just
[2:24:36] say yeah it is right it is right it is
[2:24:38] right I could say I believe that's a ten
[2:24:40] thousand uh dollars
[2:24:43] but that doesn't mean I have it I could
[2:24:46] say that's a good cold water but refuse
[2:24:50] to drink it you know what I mean and
[2:24:52] this eternal life to refuse to do it one
[2:24:55] day you will cross the line between
[2:24:57] judgment and mercy
[2:24:59] and then you won't be uh you want to
[2:25:03] have the privilege to come and receive
[2:25:05] it
[2:25:06] and these people here they turned it
[2:25:08] down each and every one of them they
[2:25:10] turned it down he gave them an
[2:25:12] invitation they turned it down they are
[2:25:13] having excuses you know let me tell you
[2:25:15] how many times have you had excuses not
[2:25:18] to believe or to do what God said
[2:25:19] because you felt something you had a
[2:25:21] reason you know church is
[2:25:29] excuses you have an invitation he has
[2:25:32] invited you he has a tablespread by that
[2:25:34] let me tell you whenever the word of God
[2:25:36] is preached God wants souls to hear it
[2:25:40] God wants and let me tell you a church
[2:25:43] that loses the burden for lost souls is
[2:25:45] a dead Church
[2:25:46] are you hearing me Church
[2:25:48] if you and the church is you
[2:25:51] as an individual it is me if you lose if
[2:25:54] you feel in your heart you have no
[2:25:55] burden to tell somebody about what you
[2:25:57] have received it means you yourself you
[2:26:00] are not convinced about it
[2:26:02] but if you are convinced about this
[2:26:04] message you will not be coming to church
[2:26:06] on Sunday every day alone by yourself
[2:26:11] why you're going to have a partner
[2:26:14] remember when I was still in school I
[2:26:16] would want I had this hunger I had this
[2:26:18] thirst of inviting someone you know I
[2:26:20] wanted every time I'm with my friends
[2:26:22] I'm very busy showing them you know and
[2:26:24] they are saying no I'm very busy you
[2:26:25] know showing them motion because I had
[2:26:27] this button I had this hunger I wanted
[2:26:30] them to know what I knew I wanted them
[2:26:32] to know my God I wanted them to go to
[2:26:34] the Rapture imagine the mere thought of
[2:26:36] thinking I'm going to go to the Rapture
[2:26:37] and leave my friends who was killing me
[2:26:39] so oh God I want to also compare them I
[2:26:42] want to bring them in I want us to go
[2:26:44] together
[2:26:47] one time I remember I went to church and
[2:26:50] I was at school I was a
[2:26:52] a school and then I went to church that
[2:26:55] evening it was there was a service so I
[2:26:57] came rushing because I was a bit late
[2:26:58] and then I found the church locked
[2:27:01] hi no one
[2:27:03] hi
[2:27:04] I almost fainted I was like oh God
[2:27:14] they have left me and they say hey
[2:27:17] Google
[2:27:20] because the church was locked
[2:27:24] and then I started fidgeting I had my
[2:27:26] Nokia I started 210 I thought I don't
[2:27:28] remember
[2:27:29] some of you don't know that phone and
[2:27:31] then I started calling calling the
[2:27:33] pastor's phone
[2:27:34] the telephone number you've got not
[2:27:36] available
[2:27:37] [Music]
[2:27:42] said let me call another brother's
[2:27:44] number this one must be on because I was
[2:27:45] calling the spiritual Brothers only
[2:27:49] you know in that moment you're not
[2:27:52] called a brother or the sister you know
[2:27:53] that it was always you know lazy you
[2:27:56] will call the one who you know Insidious
[2:27:58] so that you know if this one is here
[2:27:59] everything is fine
[2:28:01] so I started getting another number of a
[2:28:05] brother and when I called he said a
[2:28:07] telephone number you've called it's not
[2:28:08] available I said I'm finished
[2:28:10] hey little I'm telling you the truth my
[2:28:13] my feet began shaking I said oh God the
[2:28:16] Rapture has has happened and then I said
[2:28:19] but let me try one more I call the
[2:28:21] pastor's wife so let me record it
[2:28:24] I was sweating my feet was shaking
[2:28:27] and then I called the number
[2:28:32] I said wrote you now I said let me
[2:28:35] listen
[2:28:38] it was not ringing so I think they have
[2:28:40] left
[2:28:42] they have gone
[2:28:44] so
[2:28:46] hello ah I said oh thank you Jesus
[2:28:51] said yes yes said oh we are in a
[2:28:54] convention I said ah I even Switched Off
[2:28:56] I said Thank You Jesus hey I began
[2:28:59] worshiping there because I knew I was
[2:29:02] not left for the rapture
[2:29:04] let me tell you let me tell you some of
[2:29:06] you are playing with this message you
[2:29:08] are going to be so sad when you come one
[2:29:11] day and you meet yourself here in the
[2:29:14] church alone and you realize there is no
[2:29:16] picture there is no song reader there is
[2:29:18] no pianist why because they have all
[2:29:20] gone to the Rapture and you are alone
[2:29:22] here you are going to be so sorry
[2:29:26] that you will realize will be the
[2:29:28] greatest mistake you've ever met
[2:29:32] when it all Dawns on you it was real it
[2:29:36] wasn't a joke
[2:29:38] hey
[2:29:41] hey white will be so bad for you it will
[2:29:43] be some
[2:29:45] one who was going to the Catholic Church
[2:29:47] because for you you know everything that
[2:29:50] is coming next hey
[2:29:53] the people who were hearing what you
[2:29:55] people are preaching huh
[2:29:58] some of those that you told to stream
[2:29:59] yourselves and they had a little bit
[2:30:01] about the Rapture they will they will
[2:30:03] call you and they will find your number
[2:30:04] on so they will consult with you tell us
[2:30:07] what is coming next you are the people
[2:30:09] who was preaching these things
[2:30:11] and you will tell them don't talk to me
[2:30:14] not because you know what is coming next
[2:30:17] you know what the tribulation is coming
[2:30:19] next
[2:30:21] you will know everything
[2:30:23] you will know you are doing
[2:30:26] because you are not even too sure that
[2:30:28] you will have his Mercy
[2:30:30] because Grace can no longer work for you
[2:30:32] Grace will be over by the way Grace is
[2:30:34] over at that time
[2:30:36] no more grace
[2:30:38] the Bible says here that is filth is
[2:30:40] filth is still he that is Holy is a
[2:30:42] holistic
[2:30:43] you see but when you a man hears the
[2:30:46] word and spans God is Mercy by refusing
[2:30:48] to believe the word by refusing to let
[2:30:50] the word be a father part of him just
[2:30:52] like wash to refuse oh brother sister it
[2:30:55] will be so sad for them at that day but
[2:30:57] I don't want to be among of them I want
[2:30:58] to be a man of those that receive
[2:31:00] everyone
[2:31:03] whereby I can live every night every day
[2:31:06] and be waiting for the coming of the
[2:31:08] Lord not only in this one thing amen
[2:31:10] that I'm one of his and he's mine
[2:31:13] that Jesus is mine Jesus Is Mine
[2:31:15] everywhere everywhere I be Jesus Is Mine
[2:31:19] hmm
[2:31:21] and uh you know if you have that button
[2:31:24] and you believe this message with all
[2:31:25] your heart you're going to have a burden
[2:31:28] for the lost souls to compel them
[2:31:29] because you want them to come you want
[2:31:31] them there is this friend of mine I had
[2:31:33] I was always preaching you know one time
[2:31:35] I took the message books I started
[2:31:37] reading for him by force I told him
[2:31:39] listen because I was I read the message
[2:31:41] like this one which I read is your life
[2:31:44] of the gospel and I was telling you to
[2:31:45] read it so with you I just told you to
[2:31:48] read but with him I would pull him put
[2:31:50] him in my uh next to me in the when
[2:31:53] everybody has gone to the dormitory to
[2:31:56] sleep and we sit in the classroom and I
[2:31:58] take the message out I begin reading I
[2:32:00] will tell him let me just unread one
[2:32:02] page for you so I'll begin reading one
[2:32:04] page after after the first page it
[2:32:06] becomes appetizing for him he tells me
[2:32:08] read the next page and I read the next
[2:32:10] page he says read the next page we would
[2:32:12] finish the whole book of 30 pages
[2:32:15] why because it was so appetizing for him
[2:32:18] it was so real it was so powerful and at
[2:32:21] the end he came to church
[2:32:22] he came to church and he wanted to hear
[2:32:25] more and you know when the devil saw
[2:32:28] that he wanted to hear more then at his
[2:32:30] church they told him now you're the
[2:32:31] youth leader from beginning with today
[2:32:33] yet he was the most despised among
[2:32:35] others people you know they gave him to
[2:32:37] be the youth leader and they stopped
[2:32:39] coming to church here until today I
[2:32:41] always called him I said do you remember
[2:32:42] the message used to give he said yes it
[2:32:44] is the truth but pray for me but let me
[2:32:47] tell you I feel sorry for him but I
[2:32:49] compelled him each time let me tell you
[2:32:51] whoever you are in contact with compel
[2:32:52] them to come in
[2:32:54] the door is fast closing the door is
[2:32:57] fast closing the time of Grace is
[2:32:59] finishing and if you if they've had and
[2:33:02] they've had in their hearts there's no
[2:33:04] more grace for them Grace is Grace as
[2:33:05] long as it can be received are you
[2:33:07] hearing me Church
[2:33:08] so he says Jesus said you go bring them
[2:33:11] bring them
[2:33:14] go tell this the poor the maim the whole
[2:33:17] the blind you know let me tell you not
[2:33:19] very many people who are powerful
[2:33:22] in the status of this world believe this
[2:33:24] message
[2:33:25] many of them you know the Bible says in
[2:33:28] First Corinthians 1 26 for you see your
[2:33:30] calling Brethren how about many wise men
[2:33:33] after the flesh not many mighty not many
[2:33:36] noble are called but God has chosen the
[2:33:39] foolish things of this world
[2:33:42] to confound the wise and God has chosen
[2:33:45] the weak things of this world to
[2:33:48] confound the things that are Mighty and
[2:33:50] the best things of this world are the
[2:33:52] things that are despised God has chosen
[2:33:54] yeah and the things which are not to
[2:33:57] bring to note the things which are that
[2:33:59] no flesh shall glory in his presence God
[2:34:02] doesn't want you to go in the Rapture
[2:34:04] and say it was because
[2:34:07] I was very rich
[2:34:09] it was because I gave a lot of money to
[2:34:11] church you know this is why they're
[2:34:12] doing their churches they make they get
[2:34:14] the rich people
[2:34:15] and a brother
[2:34:16] my brother
[2:34:18] are you in the service can you give me
[2:34:20] that chair which I Seated on
[2:34:22] come with it please
[2:34:23] they get the rich people like this
[2:34:25] brother
[2:34:26] and they tell them you you are rich
[2:34:28] sit next to the preacher
[2:34:32] sit here
[2:34:33] because he's giving a lot of tithe he's
[2:34:36] giving a lot of money to the church he's
[2:34:38] giving you know every time the pastor is
[2:34:40] preaching he's looking at the rich man
[2:34:42] to see whether he's smiling or not
[2:34:45] if the man is not smiling he will change
[2:34:47] his gospel a bit and then he will look
[2:34:49] again then if the man is going to say
[2:34:52] yeah now now the word is working because
[2:34:54] he's expecting another check or he's
[2:34:56] expecting another money he's expecting
[2:34:57] something from this man and this is what
[2:34:59] the gospel has become but the Bible says
[2:35:02] in look at our calling just look for
[2:35:04] example in this little Fellowship here
[2:35:06] not many mighty not many powerful they
[2:35:08] are there but they say they are not so
[2:35:10] many
[2:35:11] there are not so many of the world not
[2:35:14] so many rich not so many but he has
[2:35:15] chosen the foolish things oh are you the
[2:35:17] wise things my brother
[2:35:18] he says he has chosen the foolish things
[2:35:21] huh I will not call you my foolish
[2:35:23] brother but I'll call you my my precious
[2:35:25] brother he has he has God as the foolish
[2:35:27] things of the world to the world we are
[2:35:29] foolish but to God we are wise God bless
[2:35:31] you my brother here we don't make the
[2:35:33] rich people sit on the pulpit
[2:35:36] you see this is what they have made this
[2:35:39] is what they have made the church you
[2:35:40] see they have made it a place of Comedy
[2:35:42] a place where you know the the the they
[2:35:45] recognize you know one another and you
[2:35:48] know but you see it says go to the
[2:35:49] streets go to the bias call everyone
[2:35:52] call the blind call the name call
[2:35:55] everybody let them come in
[2:35:57] Hallelujah that is our mandate
[2:36:01] and I said this should be the burden of
[2:36:03] this church it should be the vision of
[2:36:05] his church
[2:36:07] our vision is not to get many numbers of
[2:36:10] people or to get a beautiful building
[2:36:12] our vision in days of the voice
[2:36:15] Fellowship is to get every soul that was
[2:36:18] predestinated unto life
[2:36:23] that is our vision that's why we preach
[2:36:25] if that wasn't the reason I would not be
[2:36:27] preaching I tell you
[2:36:29] but God proved it to me that you can
[2:36:32] call people he can sanctify people
[2:36:36] when I was Ethiopia I almost cried you
[2:36:39] know brother Gideon
[2:36:41] but again picked my my wife and I from
[2:36:44] the airport many years ago about 11
[2:36:46] years ago just you know we were very
[2:36:48] little and you know just going on our
[2:36:50] honeymoon and he picked us up from the
[2:36:52] airport he took us to his house gave us
[2:36:54] a room and then introduced to us the the
[2:36:57] little uh
[2:36:59] uh the little guest house where we
[2:37:01] started staying and that's where the
[2:37:03] church started from but in that guest
[2:37:05] house we started inviting people one by
[2:37:07] one what was our burden what was our
[2:37:09] vision to tell them about this message
[2:37:12] to tell them there is a bride that God
[2:37:14] is calling out of their denominations to
[2:37:16] tell them
[2:37:17] there is a message to the world
[2:37:20] so now brother Gideon 11 years later was
[2:37:24] in the church with me on Sunday last
[2:37:26] Sunday you know and he sat there
[2:37:29] and after the service he told me you
[2:37:31] must be very happy I said yes brother
[2:37:32] Gideon
[2:37:33] it is beyond words to see all those
[2:37:37] people that have believed the message
[2:37:38] now in the country more than
[2:37:40] you know we are counting down the rivers
[2:37:43] of more than 500 and plus you know in
[2:37:45] the country of Ethiopia just because of
[2:37:47] a witness and a burden and I'm telling
[2:37:50] you friends God can use you to change
[2:37:52] this country you as an individual
[2:37:54] as long as your burden is right
[2:37:56] some of you will brother Gideon at that
[2:37:59] time gave us three hundred dollars it is
[2:38:01] never mentioned anywhere but his reward
[2:38:02] is in heaven
[2:38:04] some of you may give money others God
[2:38:06] may use you to you know there's a sister
[2:38:08] when I was going she gave me a hundred
[2:38:09] thousand God bless you whoever you are
[2:38:11] you know she gave me 100 for the mission
[2:38:13] and others you know you may pray just to
[2:38:15] sincerely you pray others you will go
[2:38:17] out and bring a friend others you will
[2:38:19] do something but let me tell you the
[2:38:20] burden is to bring and compel them to
[2:38:23] come in for the married sub of the Lamb
[2:38:26] that is our burden if God brings them
[2:38:29] and they happen to be ten thousand well
[2:38:31] and good but if all that there is in
[2:38:34] namgongo is 100 that's what we want
[2:38:37] I'm telling you that's our vision our
[2:38:40] vision is not to become you know these
[2:38:42] days the preachers their vision is oh I
[2:38:44] want to be a very rich preacher I want
[2:38:46] to all own a private jet you know they
[2:38:48] they set those goals right at the
[2:38:50] beginning they write it down even some
[2:38:52] of them write it down I met them I've
[2:38:53] met them and they call themselves
[2:38:54] Visionaries
[2:38:56] they say I'm a Visionary what is your
[2:38:59] vision
[2:39:00] number one
[2:39:01] in 10 years I want to have a 10 000
[2:39:04] people
[2:39:06] then then after this time then I want to
[2:39:09] buy a private jet I want to buy a this
[2:39:12] is expensive suits a specialist shoes
[2:39:15] and you know these kind of cars and you
[2:39:18] know and own this number of houses and I
[2:39:20] have a cathedral that is
[2:39:22] that those are not our vision that's not
[2:39:24] our vision if they're doing it it's not
[2:39:26] our vision our vision is very different
[2:39:28] from the denominations your goal is the
[2:39:31] rapture and our vision is to call the
[2:39:33] last one so we can go
[2:39:35] are you here in good church and that's
[2:39:37] why Jesus Christ said he was so sad when
[2:39:40] he saw that nobody came he was so sad he
[2:39:42] said I no one came no one
[2:39:46] okay if they have refused go to the main
[2:39:49] go to the poor tell them to come they
[2:39:52] came and the servants came and said yeah
[2:39:54] they have come and yeah there is room
[2:40:00] [Music]
[2:40:05] can you sing with me now Rue
[2:40:10] yes there is Rule there is a roommate
[2:40:15] fountain for thee one more time room
[2:40:21] oh yes
[2:40:23] there is a roof there is a room at a
[2:40:28] fountain
[2:40:30] there is room room
[2:40:33] [Music]
[2:40:35] yes
[2:40:37] there is a roof ah the fountain
[2:40:42] and they said there is room so he said
[2:40:45] if there is room if there is room
[2:40:48] hey let me tell you how men are we here
[2:40:52] we don't know
[2:40:55] however much we are I want to tell you
[2:40:57] there is room
[2:40:59] even here in the church our church is
[2:41:01] here look at yourself
[2:41:04] look at every chair that doesn't have a
[2:41:06] person sitting next to you
[2:41:08] look around check the labor that look
[2:41:10] around
[2:41:11] there is room can we say there is room
[2:41:13] here there is room
[2:41:15] the place is not full there is more
[2:41:18] souls out there that can that need to
[2:41:20] fill those chairs we all talk about the
[2:41:23] body should not be in the pastor's
[2:41:25] bubble you understand it should be the
[2:41:28] burden of every believer who is
[2:41:31] convinced and concerned about this
[2:41:33] message to be the truth
[2:41:35] it should be a button brother Joe it
[2:41:37] should be about in my brother my sister
[2:41:38] you know whereby you will invite
[2:41:40] somebody to church whereby you will you
[2:41:42] know convince them compel them that's
[2:41:44] the word there is room at a fountain for
[2:41:46] them you don't bring them to a church
[2:41:48] you bring them to Christ that's the
[2:41:50] difference between us and the
[2:41:51] denominations
[2:41:53] I want to conclude now looking at verse
[2:41:55] number three he says if there is room
[2:41:56] now go to the streets and highways and
[2:41:58] hedges compare them to come in
[2:42:02] that my house may be filled I was
[2:42:04] supposed to say I was supposed to stay
[2:42:06] in Addis uh for three days and then
[2:42:08] spend the rest seven or ten days uh up
[2:42:11] in the
[2:42:12] in the Northern areas those northern
[2:42:15] areas if you've not read articulated
[2:42:17] article it's a bit dangerous because
[2:42:18] it's uh they are considered to be one of
[2:42:22] the
[2:42:24] uh founders of Christianity actually
[2:42:26] because they they've been Christians for
[2:42:29] very many years
[2:42:31] they actually did their history back to
[2:42:33] Solomon and the Queen of Sheba which is
[2:42:35] the queen Market of Ethiopia some
[2:42:38] sometime back in in many years ago and
[2:42:42] so they even claimed to have the Ark of
[2:42:44] the Covenant in that region somewhere in
[2:42:45] one of the churches and it is heavily
[2:42:47] regarded no one even knows where it is
[2:42:49] and so they kind of Disguise it and
[2:42:51] things which could be true or not true I
[2:42:54] don't know but when you read in the
[2:42:55] Bible actually after the Queen of Sheba
[2:42:57] visited Solomon you don't see any
[2:42:59] mention of the Ark of the covenants it
[2:43:01] could be true that the queen took it to
[2:43:03] custody but we do not know but that that
[2:43:06] place is considered to be one of the
[2:43:08] places that uh they have they believe
[2:43:10] themselves you know Aramaic the old
[2:43:13] writings of the Bible were in Aramaic in
[2:43:15] a special day some of them and around
[2:43:18] Mike comes from geese and giz uh is the
[2:43:21] language of these people in a in a
[2:43:24] tigray and Amharic and tigrinya comes
[2:43:28] both an Aramaic from geese and so they
[2:43:31] say even the Bible was written in their
[2:43:33] language and and they said so we have
[2:43:36] nothing to give them nothing new to give
[2:43:37] them but I desire to if it wasn't
[2:43:40] because I was compelled to stay in
[2:43:42] Addison I wanted to go and you know go
[2:43:45] all over those areas and saw the seat of
[2:43:47] the world that's what I always do travel
[2:43:48] around and then now concentrate on small
[2:43:50] small areas but even then God was able
[2:43:53] to give us Souls who are burdened for
[2:43:56] this word and they wanted to spread in
[2:43:58] the in their area one of these pastors
[2:43:59] that I told you of he spoke to me said
[2:44:01] what are we going to do because this is
[2:44:03] the truth
[2:44:04] if we started preaching it now everybody
[2:44:06] will say we are preaching heresy and I
[2:44:09] told them if it's the truth God will
[2:44:10] stand behind truth
[2:44:12] God will vindicate you the nomination is
[2:44:15] standing behind them but God will stand
[2:44:16] behind you and if God is behind you then
[2:44:19] you are sure you God will protect you
[2:44:21] and God will strengthen you and I told
[2:44:23] him this is what we have done and I gave
[2:44:24] them the testimony of Addis Ababa gave
[2:44:27] them the testimony of Uganda how many
[2:44:28] Believers have believed this message let
[2:44:30] me tell you never be ashamed to stand
[2:44:34] for this message
[2:44:36] never because God is behind this message
[2:44:38] you young people God is behind this
[2:44:40] message your generation may not agree
[2:44:43] with you when you you you you even feel
[2:44:45] ashamed to say it because your field is
[2:44:47] so far from what they believe no if you
[2:44:50] say the word God is behind you at that
[2:44:52] moment God is behind you at that moment
[2:44:54] and God will fight for those that stand
[2:44:56] for his word
[2:44:58] and he said to that if there is still
[2:45:01] room go to the highways and the ages
[2:45:03] compare them to come where are the
[2:45:05] people who are abandoned for the lost
[2:45:06] souls where are they
[2:45:08] where are they even now in the
[2:45:10] fellowship here where are they are you
[2:45:12] burdened for the Lost Souls
[2:45:23] but people listen to what the prophet
[2:45:25] says here in God's provided way
[2:45:28] I'll
[2:45:31] I'll just read this last one I'll skip
[2:45:34] that in the eligation church AJ says
[2:45:36] they were not burdened for Souls talking
[2:45:38] of the denominations but they were
[2:45:40] abandoned with wealth
[2:45:42] they had the wrong burden they had a
[2:45:45] burden for their wealth but not
[2:45:46] abandoned for lost souls the scriptures
[2:45:49] say they didn't know that they were
[2:45:50] wretched or miserable blind
[2:45:56] let me tell you money doesn't bring
[2:45:58] Souls nor does money make a rich did you
[2:46:01] know that the Bible says by the way this
[2:46:04] is the richest age that there has ever
[2:46:06] been on Earth Our Generation
[2:46:09] is the richest some of you have a
[2:46:11] smartphone
[2:46:12] uh even Solomon never had one King
[2:46:15] Solomon I'm talking about
[2:46:17] and you have one you are richer than
[2:46:19] King Solomon in that regard
[2:46:22] this is the richest age
[2:46:25] your plans Rockets science medicine you
[2:46:30] know a lot of things are accumulated and
[2:46:33] and you know people have broken you know
[2:46:35] into you know God is laboratory and
[2:46:38] they've been able to invent many things
[2:46:40] even in science why because wisdom has
[2:46:43] increased and money has increased so
[2:46:44] they have a lot of wealth
[2:46:46] but the more wealth the we have attained
[2:46:49] the Lesser burden we have had for lost
[2:46:51] souls
[2:46:52] you see every Church these days and I'm
[2:46:55] concluding here every church is burdened
[2:46:57] to see which is the best better Church
[2:47:00] I'm even afraid in the message it is
[2:47:02] also coming whereby pastors are
[2:47:04] competing who is the who who has a
[2:47:07] better Ministry a better Church who has
[2:47:10] more people
[2:47:11] who who has more people who who has this
[2:47:15] better who who preaches better than the
[2:47:17] other one who this is not supposed to be
[2:47:18] our burden
[2:47:20] who has more money this other abandoned
[2:47:23] friends let us wake up what is our
[2:47:25] burden our burden is for lost souls our
[2:47:29] burden is to compel them that was the
[2:47:31] burden of when he was pulled to places
[2:47:33] you know you will get this better he
[2:47:35] said no when he came to South Africa
[2:47:37] they were telling him not to preach the
[2:47:38] Negroes the black people but he said no
[2:47:40] I must preach to them
[2:47:43] because it was his burden our battle is
[2:47:45] not for money for church for riches for
[2:47:48] buildings for more people for more money
[2:47:50] for more cars more this more that if God
[2:47:53] gives it to us praise God but our body
[2:47:56] is for souls for them to come to the
[2:47:59] knowledge of the truth for them to
[2:48:01] realize who they are what are you going
[2:48:03] to do about it Jesus Christ has said go
[2:48:05] out to the streets and there by ways
[2:48:08] compare them to come compare them to
[2:48:10] come compel them compel them is like
[2:48:12] almost begging them please come please
[2:48:14] come not to the church or to the church
[2:48:18] or the or system compel them to come to
[2:48:20] the message of the hour be consumed with
[2:48:23] a desire for them to realize what God
[2:48:26] has done for you
[2:48:29] this message we have received is not a
[2:48:30] denomination it's not another church
[2:48:32] it's more than a church oh my God
[2:48:37] it's more than a church
[2:48:45] huh no someone told me all that many
[2:48:48] churches they said so what
[2:48:50] this is not just a church another church
[2:48:53] there are many churches yes but this is
[2:48:55] not a church it's more than a church
[2:48:57] it's a lighthouse that is standing for
[2:48:59] the message of the hour
[2:49:02] Hallelujah and it doesn't have to take
[2:49:04] me it can take anybody but this Pulpit
[2:49:07] is dedicated to preach this message and
[2:49:09] whoever will stand here at the purpose
[2:49:11] the desire is to preach to let the light
[2:49:13] shine so that those who are in darkness
[2:49:16] can be able to be compelled to come and
[2:49:19] realize what Jesus Christ is doing in
[2:49:20] our day let us stand up on our feet
[2:49:28] [Applause]
[2:49:37] thank you
[2:49:39] foreign
[2:49:42] I surrender all to you everything I give
[2:49:45] to you
[2:49:47] [Music]
[2:49:51] I don't know how to express myself
[2:49:53] I've just maybe shared a quarter of what
[2:49:55] I had in my heart
[2:49:58] to you today because the burden is great
[2:50:02] there's a lot to do
[2:50:04] there's a lot of work to do
[2:50:06] you know
[2:50:08] even sometimes as preachers we say oh
[2:50:10] Lord I want to do this I don't have
[2:50:11] money but you realize it's not money
[2:50:13] that does it it is the burden that God
[2:50:16] stands behind that
[2:50:19] but even if we ourselves what have we
[2:50:21] done
[2:50:22] what have you done personally
[2:50:26] have you compared them to come what have
[2:50:27] you done in your own little way
[2:50:29] those are the rewards which will be
[2:50:31] revealed when we go over Over Yonder the
[2:50:34] sacrifices you have made for this
[2:50:36] precious message
[2:50:37] [Music]
[2:50:40] if God can consume us with a desire for
[2:50:43] lost souls
[2:50:44] and if you are here and you are lost
[2:50:46] soul
[2:50:47] maybe you're lost and you've lost your
[2:50:50] way
[2:50:52] I'm compelling you in the name of Jesus
[2:50:54] Christ to repent of your sins and repent
[2:50:56] of your ways and come to the Lord
[2:50:58] because times
[2:50:59] running out so fast on us we don't know
[2:51:02] what is going to happen next
[2:51:06] [Music]
[2:51:10] God help us
[2:51:13] Lord Jesus
[2:51:15] father I pray over these people Lord and
[2:51:18] Whoever has been under the sound of my
[2:51:19] voice
[2:51:20] in this service Lord I've laid out a
[2:51:23] little bit of the burden you've blessed
[2:51:25] on my heart
[2:51:26] there's a lot of work we have to do
[2:51:29] how long shall we continue the childish
[2:51:31] things Lord of thinking it is money that
[2:51:34] can do it or it is a
[2:51:37] power or strength or ability
[2:51:40] Lord we realize it only takes a little
[2:51:42] body and a little nudge obedience to
[2:51:45] just go out and compare them to come
[2:51:48] this is more than just a church or more
[2:51:50] than just salvation it is calling your
[2:51:52] bride in this last age and help us to
