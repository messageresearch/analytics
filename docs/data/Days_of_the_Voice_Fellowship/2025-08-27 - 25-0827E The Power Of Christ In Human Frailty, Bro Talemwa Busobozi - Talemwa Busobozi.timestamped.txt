[54:05] that we may see him in our brother,
[54:10] our sister. Lord, I ask that even in
[54:13] this service, Lord,
[54:15] as we are going, Lord, to open your word
[54:17] and
[54:19] to minister to your saint.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray
[54:23] that your Holy Spirit will help us.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; There is nothing, Lord, that we can be
[54:28] able to feed your children at all.
[54:32] But help us, Lord.
[54:34] Help us to give them spiritual food in
[54:36] this season.
[54:38] For you know what they need.
[54:41] I I humbly ask that you may have your
[54:43] way.
[54:45] Everybody that will be under the sound
[54:46] of my voice tonight
[54:49] having a hunger and a desire in their
[54:51] heart
[54:54] to hear from God that you may come and
[54:56] minister to them. Grant it Lord in Jesus
[55:01] name.
[55:02] Amen. Amen.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; God bless your church. Good evening.

[55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:28] always happy to see those who make it on
[55:30] Wednesday
[55:35] because I know it's um not entirely easy
[55:37] to be to be in church on Wednesday.
[55:42] So shall we turn to our Bibles this
[55:44] evening?
[55:47] I'm also speaking to evening light by
[55:49] tabernacle.
[55:50] evening
[55:52] gather on Zoom to tonight.
[55:56] We send our greetings to the saints
[56:00] that are streaming this service on Zoom.
[56:04] We are reading 2 Corinthians chapter 12
[56:10] and you know when we are speaking uh on
[56:12] Zoom also so we just do an hour.
[56:17] [Music]
[56:18] So just try to stay with me.
[56:24] May God help us.
[56:27] Um 1 Corinthians 12 we reading from
[56:29] verses 7 to 10.
[56:40] And I'm reading in the name of the Lord.
[56:45] Now I read.
[56:50] Okay.
[56:51] I'm I'm I'm reading from my wrong
[56:53] chapter here.
[56:58] supposed to be chapter 12
[57:01] 7. Yes. Unless I should be exalted above
[57:06] measure through the abundance of the
[57:08] revelations, there was given to me a
[57:11] thorn in the flesh, the messenger of
[57:14] Satan, to buffet me, lest I should be
[57:17] exalted above measure. For this thing I
[57:19] besought the Lord thrice, that it might
[57:22] be that it might depart from me. And he
[57:26] said unto me, "My grace is sufficient
[57:28] for thee, for my strength is made
[57:30] perfect in weakness. Most gladly
[57:33] therefore will I rather glory
[57:36] in my infirmities, that the power of
[57:38] Christ may rest upon me.
[57:48] forch.
[58:02] [Music]
[58:18] [Music]
[58:31] Okay. Are you reading verses 11 as well?
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Which verse is that?
[58:38] &gt;&gt; There is 10.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; That's 10.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Okay. Therefore, I take pleasure in
[58:41] infirmities, in reproaches, in
[58:44] necessities, in persecutions, in
[58:46] distresses, for Christ's sake. For when
[58:49] I am weak, then am I strong.
[58:53] [Music]
[59:02] [Music]
[59:11] Amen.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. May God bless the
[59:14] reading of the word.
[59:17] So this evening I'm just um having a
[59:19] little subject.
[59:22] The power of Christ in human frailty.
[59:27] The power of Christ in human frailty. in
[59:30] human weakness.
[59:35] Praise the name of the Lord.
[59:37] Have you ever been weak?
[59:40] Have you ever been weak?
[59:42] All of us here are weak.
[59:46] There is none strong among us.
[59:49] And all of you um under the sound of my
[59:51] voice,
[59:53] even all of you brethren on YouTube or
[59:55] Zoom or whatever it is,
[59:58] you know when I said that, you smiled
[1:00:00] because you know that you are weak.
[1:00:04] There's none strong among us.
[1:00:07] And you see God wants it to be that way.
[1:00:11] I want you to imagine that you were in
[1:00:14] in a situation
[1:00:16] where you never had a weakness.
[1:00:22] You you were just perfect in everything,
[1:00:26] in all your behavior,
[1:00:29] in all your speech, in all your actions,
[1:00:32] in all your words,
[1:00:34] you know, in all your thoughts.
[1:00:37] You are perfect. You are good. Do you
[1:00:40] think you would need Jesus?
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; You would not. And the fact that Jesus
[1:00:45] came,
[1:00:48] you know, God came in flesh to do the
[1:00:51] work of redemption
[1:00:53] shows that none was good.
[1:00:57] None was perfect. And that he came that
[1:00:59] we might be perfect.
[1:01:02] That he came that you know to become
[1:01:05] sin.
[1:01:06] that we might become the righteousness
[1:01:08] of God in Christ.
[1:01:13] And because he knows that within us,
[1:01:16] you know, there is no perfection without
[1:01:19] him.
[1:01:20] Amen. So if you have ever been in a
[1:01:23] moment
[1:01:24] or you have ever felt in your prayer,
[1:01:27] you prayed, "Oh God, why don't you take
[1:01:30] this thing away from me?"
[1:01:33] How many have ever prayed? You don't
[1:01:34] need to raise a hand. You don't need to
[1:01:35] raise your hand but you know God sees
[1:01:37] you but I can almost tell you 100% of us
[1:01:43] and there are many people who would
[1:01:44] rather say I would like to be like
[1:01:46] somebody else
[1:01:49] I like to be so like so and so my friend
[1:01:52] never pray that prayer
[1:01:54] you do not know how that person is
[1:01:58] but you will you will be amazed to know
[1:02:01] that you are good in that you think that
[1:02:03] you are bad
[1:02:05] And you think they are good because they
[1:02:08] are not weak in the spot you are weak in
[1:02:12] but your weakness is not their weakness
[1:02:16] but they also have a weakness
[1:02:19] and sometimes when you get to learn
[1:02:20] their weakness
[1:02:23] then you will even feel you are better
[1:02:26] and so you feel like oh I I don't want
[1:02:29] to be like that and and and matter of
[1:02:32] fact you will always want for to be like
[1:02:34] somebody
[1:02:38] until you come close to them.
[1:02:41] When you come close to anybody,
[1:02:44] you will find that they have a spot of
[1:02:46] weakness.
[1:02:49] There is no human being that is
[1:02:52] exonerated.
[1:02:55] From Moses
[1:02:57] right to Jesus,
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; every human being
[1:03:04] Every human being,
[1:03:07] brother Brham had lots of weaknesses.
[1:03:11] Elijah, Ezekiel, Paul and and we can
[1:03:15] Isaiah, all of them. And now you can put
[1:03:18] your name among them. So if you have a
[1:03:20] weakness tonight, you are in good
[1:03:23] company.
[1:03:25] If you have a weakness tonight that you
[1:03:28] wish away,
[1:03:30] I want to have good news for you.
[1:03:32] That's why you are here today.
[1:03:35] And I I want to also tell you, God wants
[1:03:37] you to have it.
[1:03:40] If you do not have it,
[1:03:43] God will ensure
[1:03:45] you if you are his child that you come
[1:03:48] into that place
[1:03:50] of weakness
[1:03:53] if you are his child. In the message
[1:03:56] Christ is revealed in his own word.
[1:04:00] Brother Bam said, "I was just talking to
[1:04:02] a young minister
[1:04:05] and his wife in the room just a few
[1:04:08] moments ago and both of them are nervous
[1:04:12] just like the rest of the world,
[1:04:16] rest of the human beings on earth."
[1:04:19] I say remember
[1:04:21] Satan has got a punch coming at you.
[1:04:27] He doesn't care who you are.
[1:04:29] He's got a right
[1:04:32] for that one punch.
[1:04:38] Satan has a right for that one punch
[1:04:43] as far as your life is concerned.
[1:04:47] Which had you rather be that punch? Be
[1:04:51] blind or be an arthritic sitting in a
[1:04:56] chair or be nervous?
[1:05:05] And this couple was nervous.
[1:05:08] And was giving them counsel.
[1:05:12] And he told them, "Satan has a right
[1:05:17] to one punch."
[1:05:21] Yes.
[1:05:27] Satana has a right to give you one punch
[1:05:29] of us. There is a certain weakness in
[1:05:31] your life
[1:05:34] and God will permit
[1:05:36] and and and you know Apostle Paul called
[1:05:40] the messenger of Satan to buffet me.
[1:05:46] He called it a thorn in the flesh.
[1:05:50] And so this is a couple coming to
[1:05:51] brother Bham
[1:05:53] and they are nervous
[1:05:55] and and you know he said well there is
[1:05:58] one punch Satan has
[1:06:01] and so he said well which one would you
[1:06:04] like
[1:06:06] to be blind
[1:06:08] to have arthritis
[1:06:11] to be nervous or to be nervous? See he's
[1:06:15] got somewhere he can punch you.
[1:06:20] You've got a right to that open place.
[1:06:26] Now that's the spot you got to keep
[1:06:28] covered all the time.
[1:06:33] Each of us here have that place.
[1:06:36] And it's the weak spot
[1:06:40] that the devil knows
[1:06:43] that if he gets you in that area,
[1:06:46] he will have finished you. But then here
[1:06:50] is advising this. He says that's the
[1:06:53] spot.
[1:06:54] You have got to cover all the time.
[1:06:58] Praise the name of the Lord. And so Paul
[1:07:01] here, we'll get we will get to it later.
[1:07:04] But was introducing the message perfect
[1:07:06] strength by perfect weakness.
[1:07:13] And then he says if we have weakness
[1:07:17] we have strength.
[1:07:19] Can we say amen? It's unusual.
[1:07:23] It's an unusual subject to talk about in
[1:07:24] a Pentecostal assembly
[1:07:28] because we are always testifying. We are
[1:07:30] strong. We are strong. We are strong.
[1:07:33] If I ask how many are weak,
[1:07:36] pastor, isn't that negative?
[1:07:39] We are strong.
[1:07:41] But brother Bam says he was going to
[1:07:43] talk about weakness.
[1:07:46] And I'm going to quote so much out of
[1:07:48] that message today.
[1:07:50] And I'm going to encourage you to go and
[1:07:51] listen to that message,
[1:07:53] perfect strength
[1:07:56] by perfect weakness.
[1:07:58] I listened to it last Sunday and it
[1:08:00] really blessed me.
[1:08:02] He says, "There was," and I I'll read
[1:08:04] for you a little nuggets here and there.
[1:08:08] There was a Methodist brother and
[1:08:10] brother and I want to begin with this
[1:08:12] story
[1:08:14] that he gives. And I and I learned that
[1:08:16] children when they're following a
[1:08:17] preacher, they they they love listening
[1:08:18] to stories.
[1:08:23] Whenever you tell a story, children
[1:08:25] don't miss that part.
[1:08:28] So he says there was a Methodist
[1:08:29] brother,
[1:08:31] three of them that come to the church
[1:08:34] in Ohio
[1:08:37] or they come from Northern Indiana.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; They said to me not long ago said,
[1:08:42] "Brother Bernham, we just received the
[1:08:44] Holy Ghost.
[1:08:46] Shall we now seek for gifts for our
[1:08:49] ministry?"
[1:08:56] I I don't I shall we now seek gifts for
[1:08:58] our ministry
[1:09:00] and you've heard most of most of the
[1:09:03] Pentecostal brethren
[1:09:06] most of them really believe in doing
[1:09:08] that
[1:09:10] seeking for your gift
[1:09:14] and God will use you remember we have 1
[1:09:16] hour so you'd need to be in one spirit
[1:09:18] with me and let's go let's go a little
[1:09:20] fast brother so see that they say well
[1:09:23] I'm going to the prayer mountain for 40
[1:09:25] days
[1:09:27] and I want to pray and fast that when I
[1:09:30] go back God will use me to do miracles.
[1:09:34] God will use me to do this or to do
[1:09:36] that. They know in the area where they
[1:09:38] want
[1:09:40] God will use me to speak tongues or to
[1:09:42] interpret or I want to be a mighty
[1:09:45] preacher. I want to shake up my country.
[1:09:49] I'm seeking a gift, you know, to go and
[1:09:51] shake the country.
[1:09:54] So they go for fasting for 40 days, for
[1:09:56] the night,
[1:09:58] even for more. And so now this this
[1:10:01] these brethren, they had come all the
[1:10:04] way from Indiana.
[1:10:06] And they came and asked, "Brother Brana,
[1:10:08] they said, we just received the Holy
[1:10:10] Ghost.
[1:10:11] Shall we now go to seek for gifts
[1:10:15] for our ministry?" And brother Bam said,
[1:10:18] "I I said I don't do it.
[1:10:22] let it alone. And he turned and looked
[1:10:25] at me
[1:10:26] and and said, I just read a certain
[1:10:29] brother's book
[1:10:32] that told us after we received the Holy
[1:10:34] Ghost,
[1:10:36] we should seek gifts.
[1:10:40] How many have heard of that before?
[1:10:43] After we receive the Holy Ghost, we
[1:10:46] should seek gifts
[1:10:48] for these to use this Holy Ghost.
[1:10:55] And I said, and then he added, Brother
[1:10:58] Bam is now answering
[1:11:00] and become a stuffed shut.
[1:11:06] soft shadow somebody who is boastful
[1:11:11] you know and you find that many of those
[1:11:13] people like that they always feel that
[1:11:16] they are more spiritual than others
[1:11:18] they always feel that God is using them
[1:11:20] more than other
[1:11:22] and and if God has not spoken to them
[1:11:25] God has not spoken to anyone
[1:11:29] unless God speaks to them God cannot
[1:11:32] speak to anybody and that's what a staff
[1:11:34] shut
[1:11:37] to boast,
[1:11:39] you know. And then he says, if you
[1:11:40] notice in the Bible, it is always those
[1:11:45] who are trying to get away from it
[1:11:50] that God uses.
[1:11:53] As long as a man wants to do something
[1:11:57] and he thinks he's got enough ability,
[1:12:01] he can put the job over.
[1:12:05] God could never use that man.
[1:12:10] And he says, "Look at Moses
[1:12:12] running. Look at Paul running and the
[1:12:16] rest of them." And I can say, "Look at
[1:12:18] Isaiah. Look at Jeremiah. All of them
[1:12:21] were running. Whenever God called them,
[1:12:25] they were running trying to get away
[1:12:28] from it."
[1:12:30] And here he says, "I say don't seek
[1:12:32] nothing.
[1:12:35] God has got anything. If God has got
[1:12:37] anything for you,
[1:12:40] he will give it to you.
[1:12:43] See, and and and let him take care of
[1:12:45] that.
[1:12:47] I said, then you get some of these times
[1:12:50] like we got
[1:12:52] that everybody's wanting to do this
[1:12:56] and do that and become some great big
[1:12:59] person.
[1:13:00] Look what we got into with it.
[1:13:04] Instead of trying to to be great, we
[1:13:06] ought to we are trying to find out how
[1:13:08] little we can get.
[1:13:14] Can we all say amen to that?
[1:13:17] Amen. find try to find how can I build
[1:13:20] little.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Notice the weakest and the rejected
[1:13:28] and practically every hero
[1:13:32] God ever had
[1:13:34] on the front line
[1:13:37] was that type of person.
[1:13:41] Do you want to be a hero? Humble
[1:13:44] yourself. find out how little can I be?
[1:13:50] A person that was rejected,
[1:13:52] a person that thought he was
[1:13:54] insufficient,
[1:13:56] a person that had no ability at all.
[1:14:00] If you feel that way, then you are going
[1:14:03] to be used by God
[1:14:05] in such a mighty way. Let me tell you,
[1:14:09] brethren, God is not looking for a great
[1:14:11] person to use.
[1:14:14] God is not looking for uneducated person
[1:14:15] to use
[1:14:17] the credentials of God
[1:14:21] that he looks at the unqualified.
[1:14:24] He looks at the weak. He looks at the
[1:14:27] feeble and then he uses them to change
[1:14:30] the world.
[1:14:33] He uses them to change their families.
[1:14:36] He uses them to change their country,
[1:14:39] their society, their generation. Listen,
[1:14:45] if you're insufficient,
[1:14:48] a person that had no ability at all,
[1:14:51] then that person is just in a good
[1:14:54] shape.
[1:14:56] So God can start using
[1:15:01] is when they feel like that they can't.
[1:15:04] They haven't got nothing.
[1:15:07] That's when God can take a hold of them
[1:15:11] and do something with them.
[1:15:14] But when we are thinking that we are
[1:15:16] able,
[1:15:18] then God can't use us
[1:15:21] because we are wanting to do it ourself.
[1:15:28] Go and do some research
[1:15:32] in church history.
[1:15:34] You will find all the great men
[1:15:39] and women that God used right from the
[1:15:43] Bible and in a message in in the in this
[1:15:46] message that I'm reading for you.
[1:15:49] Brother quoted very many
[1:15:52] in the Bible and in church history. You
[1:15:55] will find that these were people who
[1:15:56] were so afraid,
[1:15:58] you know, they were so weak that they
[1:16:01] thought that they cannot do anything.
[1:16:04] Some of them thought that life had
[1:16:06] ended.
[1:16:08] Some of them thought that they are good
[1:16:10] for nothing
[1:16:12] because when they looked at themselves,
[1:16:14] they saw an end. They saw failure.
[1:16:18] They saw nothing.
[1:16:21] But those are the ones that God
[1:16:24] to and called. God loves calling a
[1:16:28] nothing person.
[1:16:31] Amen. God loves calling a person who
[1:16:33] feels insufficient.
[1:16:37] Somebody who is unqualified.
[1:16:39] You know, don't ever say I cannot serve
[1:16:42] God.
[1:16:45] Serving God is for those who have never
[1:16:46] done anything bad.
[1:16:49] Well, let me tell you brother, you look
[1:16:51] at all people that God is using,
[1:16:54] people who have done everything bad.
[1:16:58] Everything bad. Look at Moses. He was
[1:17:02] afraid person. When Moses thought he can
[1:17:05] do it, that's when he did it wrong.
[1:17:09] Everything he messed it up. He murdered
[1:17:12] somebody. God never wanted him to redeem
[1:17:14] people by murdering.
[1:17:17] But Moses thought he was educated.
[1:17:20] Moses thought he knew what he was doing.
[1:17:23] He had strength. And as long as he was
[1:17:26] strong,
[1:17:27] God left him alone.
[1:17:30] God left him alone.
[1:17:32] Even if he had a purpose for his life,
[1:17:36] maybe God has left you alone.
[1:17:38] Maybe God is not helping you because he
[1:17:41] knows you don't need help
[1:17:44] because you are strong. You can figure
[1:17:47] everything out.
[1:17:49] But brother, you need to be weak.
[1:17:52] You need to come into that place where
[1:17:54] you are feeble where you know you are
[1:17:57] weak,
[1:17:59] not a pretense.
[1:18:01] And I'm talking about a reality,
[1:18:04] a place where you can break in his
[1:18:05] presence.
[1:18:07] When you go to prayer, you say, "Oh God,
[1:18:10] see, there is nothing good in me.
[1:18:12] I've disappointed you in my life. There
[1:18:15] is nothing I can accomplish.
[1:18:18] Help me." Moses, it took 40 years
[1:18:23] to for God to be convinced
[1:18:27] that he's now nothing.
[1:18:30] He came to him when he's an old man. He
[1:18:33] didn't have the strength to fight. So he
[1:18:36] will not kill anybody else.
[1:18:39] Amen. Then God came and said, "Now
[1:18:42] Moses, you remember 40 years ago you
[1:18:46] wanted to serve me. I am now here. I am
[1:18:50] ready to use you." Moses said, "What did
[1:18:52] you say? You have come too late. I am no
[1:18:55] longer strong. I am now weak. I am
[1:18:58] feeble. I don't even my tongue. I can't
[1:19:01] speak well."
[1:19:03] You know, now can you use somebody else?
[1:19:05] I am not the right person. God said
[1:19:08] that's the reason why I have come
[1:19:11] because you don't qualify.
[1:19:13] I've come to qualify you.
[1:19:16] May God qualify you, brother.
[1:19:19] Some of you, God has allowed you to go
[1:19:21] through certain things
[1:19:24] that he may qualify you
[1:19:27] in your home, in your family, in your
[1:19:30] neighborhood, around where you live.
[1:19:34] Never feel that you cannot serve God.
[1:19:38] The moment you feel unqualified,
[1:19:41] you are in the right spot.
[1:19:44] You are the right man. You are the right
[1:19:46] woman. You are the right person. The
[1:19:49] moment you feel broken, you are the
[1:19:51] right person God wants to use.
[1:19:56] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. And
[1:19:58] when God sent Moses
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; to Egypt, Moses went there. Oh,
[1:20:05] brethren,
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; relying 100% on God,
[1:20:12] 0% on himself.
[1:20:17] And that's why God wants to use people
[1:20:22] that are weak, that are frail, because
[1:20:25] they cannot rely on themselves.
[1:20:29] But they will rely on God. You will say,
[1:20:31] "Pastor, you don't understand. I have
[1:20:34] made an irreconcilable mistakes."
[1:20:39] That is why God has called you into this
[1:20:43] message
[1:20:44] such a time as this
[1:20:47] because he wants to use it when you are
[1:20:50] weak. Moses he reached a point whereby
[1:20:54] you know when he went there you remember
[1:20:56] when they were going to cross the Red
[1:20:57] Sea
[1:20:59] when he reached there he went there
[1:21:01] because he was following the leadership
[1:21:03] of the Holy Spirit
[1:21:06] he couldn't rely on himself
[1:21:10] but then at this moment he knew he had
[1:21:12] no power
[1:21:14] no ability to make this happen.
[1:21:18] The man started crying.
[1:21:22] This is a man who was once trained as a
[1:21:24] soldier.
[1:21:26] He had all the strategy of war but at
[1:21:29] this time he could not use any of it and
[1:21:32] he started crying. Who who cries but a
[1:21:35] baby?
[1:21:38] A baby cries because a baby is helpless.
[1:21:43] Hallelujah. Because a baby is weak.
[1:21:46] Brother said the only thing a the only
[1:21:48] thing a baby does
[1:21:51] if they want something is to cry for it.
[1:21:55] And you see with our churches having
[1:21:58] fewer and fewer people crying in the
[1:22:01] presence of God.
[1:22:03] Crying just crying in the presence of
[1:22:05] God.
[1:22:06] It shows you have everything figured
[1:22:08] out.
[1:22:11] You know where's that brokenness?
[1:22:14] relying on on another.
[1:22:18] Moses cried and then God came down. He
[1:22:21] said, "Moses, why cry? Speak." Now, you
[1:22:25] might say, "Moses could have spoken."
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, he could have spoken. But he could
[1:22:31] not trust in his words.
[1:22:35] Amen. The power to make that happen
[1:22:39] was in him
[1:22:42] before he even spoke.
[1:22:44] before he even cried. What was that
[1:22:47] power? That is the power of Christ.
[1:22:52] And that power is in you today as a
[1:22:57] believer. That power is within you. The
[1:23:00] kingdom of God is not coming with
[1:23:02] observation of our mind.
[1:23:04] The kingdom of God is within you.
[1:23:08] But yet we still need to cry to the
[1:23:10] Lord.
[1:23:12] Amen. And then he will lead us. You
[1:23:15] don't just speak because you want to.
[1:23:19] You know, you have to speak by
[1:23:21] leadership.
[1:23:25] Brother Brham was a prophet, a man of
[1:23:27] God, but he never just said anything.
[1:23:32] Then he had to first see a vision.
[1:23:35] When he rose one child from the dead,
[1:23:37] then the other parents said, "Raise ours
[1:23:40] as well."
[1:23:41] He says, "I can't unless he has showed
[1:23:44] me faith."
[1:23:46] You see, because he was relying
[1:23:50] on God, not just on his own faith,
[1:23:54] but on God. And God wants a church. God
[1:23:58] wants men and women who can rely on him.
[1:24:03] And brother, sister, when you rely on
[1:24:04] God,
[1:24:06] you learn to cry
[1:24:08] in prayer, to agonize in prayer, to wait
[1:24:13] upon God because you know you are weak.
[1:24:18] You are frail. But within you lies the
[1:24:21] power of Christ. But when God leads you,
[1:24:25] then the devil will be shocked to see
[1:24:27] you speaking in authority.
[1:24:30] When you speak in authority by
[1:24:31] leadership,
[1:24:33] those words are created.
[1:24:38] Amen. He said but when we are thinking
[1:24:41] that we are able to do it
[1:24:44] then God can't use us because we are
[1:24:47] wanting to do it ourselves.
[1:24:50] Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:24:53] And so listening and then the other side
[1:24:57] we get these feelings
[1:24:59] and we think then that we are
[1:25:00] insufficient
[1:25:04] and we don't want to do it
[1:25:07] but then we just listen to the call of
[1:25:10] God.
[1:25:12] That's the very thing that God wants us
[1:25:14] to get into
[1:25:16] that kind of a shape
[1:25:20] so he can
[1:25:25] If there is one thing I have known to
[1:25:27] do,
[1:25:29] oh 19 years I've been preaching this
[1:25:34] in this message is to know that I need
[1:25:37] to yield myself to him
[1:25:40] because I can't.
[1:25:42] But he can. And if he's in me, then the
[1:25:46] power that created heaven and earth is
[1:25:50] in me. I can't but he can. When we are
[1:25:55] insufficient
[1:25:58] ourselves,
[1:25:59] then we are subject
[1:26:02] to yield to God is spirit.
[1:26:07] As long as we think that we can do it,
[1:26:11] then we can do it. But when we get to a
[1:26:14] place where we know we can't do it,
[1:26:19] then we yield ourself
[1:26:23] and he does it. Oh God, you know I'm a
[1:26:26] preacher, but I can't preach.
[1:26:29] God, you know I'm a Christian, but I
[1:26:32] can't live a Christian life. God, I can
[1:26:35] overcome this. Yes, she knows. And
[1:26:39] because you have received the revelation
[1:26:40] that you can
[1:26:43] then he will.
[1:26:47] Amen.
[1:26:48] So then if it's us trying to do it,
[1:26:53] we will fail.
[1:26:55] But if you will just yield ourselves.
[1:27:00] Someone asked me pastor what does it
[1:27:02] mean to yield yourself?
[1:27:05] Yielding yourself means you know your
[1:27:09] weakness.
[1:27:11] You know you don't have the ability.
[1:27:13] But you know when you go to serve him,
[1:27:17] you are not able. So you come to a place
[1:27:21] where you rely
[1:27:23] on him,
[1:27:25] not on yourself.
[1:27:28] So you come to a place where I say,
[1:27:30] Lord, you know how I am. I take myself
[1:27:34] out of the way.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; I'm weak. I'm bad. I'm I have issues. I
[1:27:40] have
[1:27:42] use me and then you he steps in
[1:27:48] and then he begins to use and the world
[1:27:51] can't understand that
[1:27:54] that's why the Bible called it a mystery
[1:27:58] Christ in you
[1:28:01] his power dwelling in you
[1:28:04] uses you in such a way that even you
[1:28:08] can't understand how it works.
[1:28:12] Brother Bam, many times he would say,
[1:28:13] "I'm just your brother."
[1:28:16] But when the spirit of God would come
[1:28:18] upon him, he would say, "Do you believe
[1:28:20] me as his prophet?"
[1:28:23] Oh, sorry. I I didn't mean I didn't mean
[1:28:24] to say that. I didn't. So, what was
[1:28:27] that? It was the anointing. It was
[1:28:30] Christ in him speaking. Many times he
[1:28:33] would say I had one tape when he would
[1:28:36] say this is me talking
[1:28:39] this is you know like not not William
[1:28:41] Bham speaking he's just using my lips
[1:28:45] and that's what we believe brother God
[1:28:48] must use you
[1:28:50] in your weakness
[1:28:52] in your frailty
[1:28:57] sometimes you don't even know your
[1:28:58] weakness
[1:29:00] other people will be the ones who tell
[1:29:02] you your weakness
[1:29:04] Accept your weakness. Do not refuse it.
[1:29:08] Accept that you are weak.
[1:29:11] And then begin to work towards yielding
[1:29:14] yourself
[1:29:17] and letting him come and take over.
[1:29:20] So then if it's us trying to do it,
[1:29:25] but if we will just yield oursel to God,
[1:29:28] then God cannot fail.
[1:29:32] There is only one thing that God cannot
[1:29:35] do
[1:29:37] that is fail.
[1:29:40] He can do anything else but fail
[1:29:45] but he cannot fail.
[1:29:47] That's why the Bible says I can do all
[1:29:50] things
[1:29:53] not in myself
[1:29:55] through Christ
[1:29:57] that gives me strength.
[1:29:59] So the power of Christ is in human
[1:30:03] frailty.
[1:30:08] Amen. So as long as we are trying in
[1:30:10] ourselves
[1:30:12] and depending on our own ability
[1:30:15] and so forth, we will do nothing.
[1:30:20] But when we get to a place where we know
[1:30:23] we are nothing,
[1:30:25] then God can use us.
[1:30:28] Amen. Can we say amen?
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; The important thing, one of the
[1:30:34] important thing that we must master.
[1:30:38] This is your master's degree today.
[1:30:41] Now remember this and especially you
[1:30:44] younger preachers
[1:30:46] and I know there are many younger
[1:30:47] preachers listening to me
[1:30:49] and especially you younger preachers and
[1:30:52] members alike.
[1:30:54] There is one thing that we've got to
[1:30:56] master.
[1:30:59] If we expect to fulfill God's desire in
[1:31:02] our life,
[1:31:04] that is we have to master the thought of
[1:31:07] human ability.
[1:31:14] You know, you get to a place and you you
[1:31:16] be like, you know, I know I can do that.
[1:31:17] I can do that.
[1:31:20] And then that's when you begin to see
[1:31:22] people comparing themselves to another.
[1:31:25] People
[1:31:27] who believe in human ability,
[1:31:31] they don't believe that that they they
[1:31:35] cannot do it on their own.
[1:31:39] They will always compete with others.
[1:31:42] You know, you know, when when someone
[1:31:45] does something, they will want to show
[1:31:48] that I can do it better.
[1:31:50] When someone sings in a way, they will
[1:31:53] want also to sing because someone sang
[1:31:56] and they want to show that they can do
[1:31:57] it better.
[1:31:59] When someone preaches, they also want to
[1:32:01] do the same thing. You find that even
[1:32:04] many times ministry
[1:32:07] is out of done, out of competition.
[1:32:11] You see, let me tell you, when a
[1:32:13] minister competes with another,
[1:32:16] it's no longer God.
[1:32:18] They are using their human abilities.
[1:32:22] You know, I have no reason to feel
[1:32:25] insecure
[1:32:28] because of anybody else ministering.
[1:32:34] You know,
[1:32:37] you know, you you find that oh, I I fear
[1:32:39] so and so I can't even welcome him on my
[1:32:42] page or I cannot even preach
[1:32:45] because he may outdo me.
[1:32:49] And you find ministers fighting against
[1:32:51] ministers
[1:32:53] because of insecurity.
[1:32:56] Insecurity,
[1:32:57] not because they they they don't know
[1:32:59] that God called them, but because of
[1:33:02] insecurity.
[1:33:04] But why would you have insecurity?
[1:33:07] You know, I've told many of our
[1:33:08] ministers here and I meant it and I
[1:33:11] really meant it and I can say it even
[1:33:14] and I've said it even I used to say it
[1:33:15] in Ethiopia
[1:33:17] and I would say look brother if one of
[1:33:19] you would like to start a ministry and
[1:33:22] you're from this church and you want to
[1:33:24] start a ministry so close
[1:33:27] brother you don't need to ask for my
[1:33:29] permission
[1:33:31] you have you have it 100%
[1:33:34] if God has called
[1:33:36] go right ahead and start. I will even
[1:33:39] support you even if it is 1 kometer from
[1:33:42] us.
[1:33:44] And that should be the attitude
[1:33:47] of every pastor,
[1:33:50] every minister.
[1:33:51] You know why? Let me tell you why.
[1:33:54] Because there is no minister
[1:33:57] that has a special heaven to take
[1:33:59] anybody to.
[1:34:03] that if you are in my camp, you'll go to
[1:34:05] heaven. If you in the other church, I am
[1:34:08] not sure.
[1:34:10] It is one Christ
[1:34:12] using me and using the other ministry.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; But and I'll tell you one more that
[1:34:17] there is a minister who will minister
[1:34:20] with the power of Christ.
[1:34:23] If it's with the power of Christ, you
[1:34:26] are not afraid
[1:34:28] of competition. You're not afraid of
[1:34:31] being outdone.
[1:34:33] You are not afraid of what somebody else
[1:34:36] will do. You know, you will support
[1:34:38] them. You will encourage them because
[1:34:41] they're your brother. And when God leads
[1:34:44] them to win in a certain area,
[1:34:48] it is all our victory.
[1:34:51] Hallelujah. When that goes somewhere and
[1:34:55] he baptizes 30 people, I will rejoice
[1:34:59] because it is like as if I have baptized
[1:35:01] them.
[1:35:04] Why? Because we are not competing.
[1:35:07] Christ is not divided.
[1:35:11] You know, if you are operating under the
[1:35:13] power of Christ,
[1:35:16] you do not believe in competition.
[1:35:19] You believe what my brother is doing. As
[1:35:22] long as it's led by God,
[1:35:24] it shall stand. And let me tell you some
[1:35:27] more. If a man of God stands up and does
[1:35:30] a certain thing under the leadership of
[1:35:33] the Holy Spirit, better be sure never to
[1:35:36] fight it.
[1:35:39] Never fight
[1:35:41] any minister any man of God. Because to
[1:35:45] fight it, it means to fight God.
[1:35:51] Church, we have to understand that it is
[1:35:54] not about a minister. It's about Christ.
[1:35:58] Hallelujah.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even the things I'm speaking, you
[1:36:01] may not like me. You may not love me. I
[1:36:04] don't care about that. But I warn you,
[1:36:08] listen to what I'm saying because what
[1:36:10] I'm saying is not by myself. It is by
[1:36:14] inspiration.
[1:36:16] So then it is no longer me. It is God.
[1:36:20] Just like any other preacher who would
[1:36:23] speak under the leadership of the Holy
[1:36:24] Ghost.
[1:36:26] So it is the power of Christ in human
[1:36:29] frame. Brother many times he would say
[1:36:33] you know you may not you may not uh you
[1:36:36] know uh respect the man
[1:36:40] but respect the office
[1:36:43] he holds in God. God respects the office
[1:36:48] of the man he calls.
[1:36:50] There was a man one time called Elisha.
[1:36:53] And you know Elisha made a mistake
[1:36:55] because he was angry. You know these
[1:36:58] children came out shouting baldhead bald
[1:37:00] head bhead.
[1:37:03] He said she bears
[1:37:06] come and eat these children. How many
[1:37:08] were they? 40.
[1:37:11] All of them were eaten alive.
[1:37:15] Brother man says because their parents
[1:37:17] couldn't teach them how to man of God.
[1:37:25] The man of God did something wrong
[1:37:28] but because he spoke.
[1:37:31] God honored the office.
[1:37:34] God honors the office.
[1:37:37] Amen. And we we may not respect the man
[1:37:39] but always we must respect the office.
[1:37:44] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. So if
[1:37:47] we ever get to a spot where we think we
[1:37:49] can do it on our own intelligence
[1:37:52] and our abilities, we've got to master
[1:37:56] that in such a way we can get rid of the
[1:38:00] thing and lay it aside that so God can
[1:38:02] use us.
[1:38:10] Amen. Amen. Amen. I've found that my my
[1:38:14] best services
[1:38:17] services that I felt I didn't have
[1:38:18] anything to say.
[1:38:21] God did things until I was shot.
[1:38:24] You know, I tell you what, God loves
[1:38:28] human frailty
[1:38:32] because he always wants to be glorified.
[1:38:37] And then they came and say, "Oh,
[1:38:40] our pastor Moses, look, he married an
[1:38:43] unbeliever.
[1:38:45] They were right. They were right. But
[1:38:48] they didn't understand Moses had to do
[1:38:51] that because Moses was a man that
[1:38:57] actually failed.
[1:39:00] He failed from the beginning.
[1:39:03] He failed all through.
[1:39:06] Can I give you a little examples?
[1:39:09] He failed in the beginning when he
[1:39:10] killed you.
[1:39:12] He he failed later on when he went and
[1:39:14] beat the bush, the stone twice, the rock
[1:39:17] twice. He failed when he called the
[1:39:20] children of Israel rebels.
[1:39:24] He abused the children of God. He
[1:39:27] failed. He failed when he went and
[1:39:30] married, you know, an
[1:39:33] in all those failures. In all those
[1:39:36] failures, God said, "He is my man."
[1:39:41] And let me tell you, that's the same
[1:39:42] thing God is saying about you today.
[1:39:47] God is calling you his own
[1:39:50] because you are a failure
[1:39:53] because you failed to make it on your
[1:39:54] own.
[1:39:56] That's why he said, "I will go down on
[1:39:58] earth and I will die for them." Amen.
[1:40:02] And I will give them my blood that they
[1:40:04] might be called my own because they have
[1:40:07] failed me. I will go and stand for them.
[1:40:12] Praise the name of the Lord. Don't ever
[1:40:15] let failure take you out of the presence
[1:40:18] of God.
[1:40:21] He came down and he said, "Adam, Adam,
[1:40:23] where thou?"
[1:40:25] He said, "I'm I'm naked. I'm hiding. Who
[1:40:28] told you you were naked? Did you eat?"
[1:40:31] Adam said, "Oh, the woman you gave me,
[1:40:32] don't you worry. Just come out." And he
[1:40:36] gave him
[1:40:38] cos of skin
[1:40:40] from the very beginning. God showed he
[1:40:43] was interested in human friendship.
[1:40:48] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. They will continue here and make a
[1:40:53] complete surrender.
[1:40:56] Make a complete surrender.
[1:40:58] We cannot use one ability.
[1:41:01] We've got to make a complete surrender
[1:41:05] and to come to God. And you've got to
[1:41:08] surrender to him both soul, body, and
[1:41:10] spirit.
[1:41:13] everything that you will be surrender to
[1:41:15] God
[1:41:17] in order that he can work his will in
[1:41:20] you and me.
[1:41:24] Now that's hard and I know because we
[1:41:26] are always wanting to power to put out
[1:41:29] to put our part in
[1:41:33] and something that we know we know that
[1:41:35] we want to do it.
[1:41:39] Well, I just know it should be done this
[1:41:40] way.
[1:41:42] But as long as you are doing it that
[1:41:44] way, it's going to be wrong
[1:41:48] and God will never use that.
[1:41:52] Maybe the help of the L with the help of
[1:41:55] the Lord.
[1:41:57] We are going to get into that in a few
[1:41:59] minutes.
[1:42:02] Just show you how God cannot use your
[1:42:04] ability.
[1:42:07] Amen. And now all of the human race is
[1:42:09] frail.
[1:42:11] Paul prayed three times
[1:42:14] asking the Lord to take away his thorn.
[1:42:18] The answer was
[1:42:20] there is sufficient grace.
[1:42:25] Our weakness is not our end
[1:42:28] but the beginning of Christ's power in
[1:42:31] us. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:42:38] The moment you are weak. Christ has
[1:42:41] started to work.
[1:42:43] We cannot boast of anything in and of
[1:42:46] ourselves
[1:42:49] but we boast in Christ.
[1:42:53] Amen. Romans 3 says to declare I say at
[1:42:57] this time his righteousness
[1:43:01] to declare it
[1:43:03] that he might be just and justifier of
[1:43:06] him that of of him which believeth in
[1:43:09] Jesus.
[1:43:13] Where is boasting then?
[1:43:16] It is excluded.
[1:43:18] By what law? Of what?
[1:43:22] name, but by the law of faith. Ephesians
[1:43:27] 2:6. And he has raised us up together
[1:43:32] and made us sit together
[1:43:36] in heavenly places. Don't look at me
[1:43:39] preaching. Preach with me, child.
[1:43:41] in heavenly blessings and treasures that
[1:43:44] in the ages to come
[1:43:48] he might show the exceeding riches.
[1:43:54] Remember that he might show the
[1:43:56] exceeding riches
[1:43:58] of his grace in his kindness
[1:44:03] toward us.
[1:44:05] Hallelujah
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; through Christ
[1:44:09] Jesus. For by grace are ye saved
[1:44:15] through faith. And that not of
[1:44:18] yourselves
[1:44:19] it is the gift of God.
[1:44:22] Not of works. And that not of
[1:44:24] yourselves.
[1:44:27] Amen.
[1:44:28] Lord of words said man should boast.
[1:44:32] For we are his workman.
[1:44:38] Yeah.
[1:44:40] Amen.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the devil thinks about
[1:44:44] me. I don't care what the people call
[1:44:47] me. I know one thing. Amen. I am his
[1:44:51] workmanship.
[1:44:53] I am saved through faith,
[1:44:56] not of my own works. It is the gift of
[1:44:59] God.
[1:45:01] I am created
[1:45:04] in Christ Jesus
[1:45:06] unto good works
[1:45:08] which God has before ordained.
[1:45:12] God before I was even born
[1:45:15] ordained that I will walk in the good
[1:45:18] works
[1:45:21] for the good works are not going to be
[1:45:23] done by me but by the power of Christ.
[1:45:29] Hallelujah. regardless of my human
[1:45:32] frailty.
[1:45:35] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You should stop saying I
[1:45:39] can't do it.
[1:45:42] Stop looking at your works.
[1:45:44] The more you look at your works, the
[1:45:46] more you will fail. Stop looking at the
[1:45:49] work of Christ.
[1:45:52] The more you will be changed
[1:45:55] and the more you will overcome.
[1:45:58] Let me tell you, brother, sister, the
[1:46:00] things I used to do, I do them no more.
[1:46:03] Why? The more I realize,
[1:46:06] Amen. The work of Christ in me, the more
[1:46:09] grace to overcome I have,
[1:46:14] Amen. And I still have other fruities
[1:46:17] now. But I'm a work in process.
[1:46:22] I am changed.
[1:46:24] I have been changed. and I will be
[1:46:27] changed.
[1:46:29] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:46:32] Galatians 6 says, "But God forbid
[1:46:36] that I should glory."
[1:46:42] Praise the name of the Lord,
[1:46:45] save the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:46:51] By whom the world is crucified unto me,
[1:47:00] And I unto the world
[1:47:04] to me the world is dead.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; If the world is not dead to you yet,
[1:47:11] if you still convert the things of the
[1:47:12] world, brother, let me tell you, you are
[1:47:16] still relying in your human ability.
[1:47:20] Start relying on his ability.
[1:47:24] Amen. You realize you cannot glory in
[1:47:26] yourself
[1:47:28] but you will glory in the cross of God.
[1:47:31] By whom? By whom? By Jesus Christ the
[1:47:34] world is crucified to you.
[1:47:37] For in Christ Jesus made the
[1:47:39] circumcision ath circumcision but a new
[1:47:42] creature.
[1:47:46] Amen. Colossians 1:26.
[1:47:48] Even the mystery which has been hid from
[1:47:51] ages and from generations. But now is
[1:47:55] made manifest
[1:47:57] to whom God would make known what is the
[1:48:00] riches of the glory.
[1:48:04] Amen. Amen. But God forbid that I should
[1:48:09] glory saving the cross of our Lord
[1:48:11] Jesus.
[1:48:13] Are you following? Are you following me,
[1:48:15] church? to whom God would make known
[1:48:19] what is the riches of the glory
[1:48:23] of the boasting
[1:48:25] of the power of the glory of this
[1:48:28] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[1:48:32] Christ in you when Christ is in you can
[1:48:36] now begin to boast not in you yourself
[1:48:40] but in the work of Christ
[1:48:43] in the power of Christ the hope of glory
[1:48:48] whom we preach warning every man and
[1:48:50] teaching every man in all wisdom
[1:48:53] that we may present every man perfect in
[1:48:54] Christ.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as I I approach to finish here
[1:48:59] in the message shalom Paul said now
[1:49:01] brother says now like Paul said
[1:49:02] hallelujah he had an infirmity
[1:49:06] something was bothering him the devil
[1:49:08] would buffet him blow after blow
[1:49:12] maybe that's you blow after blow blow
[1:49:16] after blow and he consulted the Lord
[1:49:19] three times
[1:49:22] to take it away from him said I don't
[1:49:24] want this Lord take it away from
[1:49:27] And then one night the Lord spoke to him
[1:49:28] and said,
[1:49:31] "My grace is sufficient."
[1:49:33] He said, "Then I will glory
[1:49:37] in my infirmity.
[1:49:40] I will glory in it. I know you are the
[1:49:43] hearer." You know why?
[1:49:47] Because Paul realized,
[1:49:49] Amen. that this infirmity
[1:49:52] was bringing down the glory of God.
[1:49:56] So, hallelujah. He said, "Praise God.
[1:50:00] I'm no longer sorry about how I feel.
[1:50:04] What I'm not able to do.
[1:50:07] I will glory
[1:50:10] in my infirmity.
[1:50:13] I've seen you heal the sick. I've seen
[1:50:15] you raise the dead. I've seen you cast
[1:50:18] out devils, open the eyes of the blind.
[1:50:21] But I've consulted you and you tell me
[1:50:24] it's your grace.
[1:50:27] Then this devil that bothers me is
[1:50:30] growing pains of your grace
[1:50:36] is growing pains of your grace.
[1:50:44] Then I'll glory
[1:50:47] in my infirmities.
[1:50:49] If I lest I get exalted above the
[1:50:51] abundance of the revelation
[1:50:55] with the revelation we have if God never
[1:50:58] allowed any family to come
[1:51:01] we would be I don't know how it will be
[1:51:04] we would think that we don't need him
[1:51:07] so he said I have to control you
[1:51:11] lest some of you begin to go higher than
[1:51:14] me that's what the devil did in the
[1:51:16] beginning so he allows those infirmities
[1:51:19] to come so he can control your power
[1:51:23] so you can remember he's the boss.
[1:51:29] Amen. Times may be hard. God has not for
[1:51:33] promised a flower bed of ease.
[1:51:37] But he has promised grace sufficient for
[1:51:39] every trial that can hit you.
[1:51:43] Grace is sufficient. Tell your neighbor
[1:51:45] grace is sufficient.
[1:51:47] Amen. When a cross gets heavy,
[1:51:51] Christ promised to be there with you.
[1:51:54] He will be with you in weakness.
[1:51:57] And Paul said in first Corinthians, as
[1:51:59] I'm approaching to finish now, and I,
[1:52:02] brethren, when I came to you, I came not
[1:52:05] with excellency of speech
[1:52:07] or declaring unto you the testimony of
[1:52:09] God.
[1:52:11] For I determined not to know anything
[1:52:13] among you,
[1:52:15] Jesus Christ. and him crucified. And I
[1:52:19] was with you and I was with you in
[1:52:24] weakness and in fear and in much
[1:52:28] trembling.
[1:52:29] And my my speech and my preaching was
[1:52:31] not with enticing words of man
[1:52:36] in demonstration of the spirit and of
[1:52:37] power that your faith should not stand
[1:52:40] in the wisdom of men
[1:52:43] but in the power of God. Amen. And
[1:52:46] brother Bam would say, "Could you
[1:52:48] imagine a man, a Pharisee of the
[1:52:50] Pharisees, a teacher of the teachers, a
[1:52:53] man that's been trained trained for the
[1:52:55] ministry to be an eloquent man that was
[1:52:59] smart and brilliant to come before a
[1:53:02] class of people like the Corinthians
[1:53:06] and and he would say, "I was with you in
[1:53:07] weakness
[1:53:09] and in fear and maturity."
[1:53:11] A man who turned the world upside down.
[1:53:14] the greatest missionary that's ever been
[1:53:16] known.
[1:53:17] He confessed that he come in weakness,
[1:53:21] not as a trained scholar,
[1:53:24] but in weakness and in fear,
[1:53:27] lest he should step off the path
[1:53:28] somewhere
[1:53:30] in much trembling because he could not
[1:53:33] trust in his own ability.
[1:53:35] The reason he was fearing
[1:53:38] not because he was scared of an enemy,
[1:53:41] but he was scared he would displease God
[1:53:43] himself.
[1:53:46] They would get his own ability
[1:53:50] mixed up in
[1:53:53] something that he had learned. He was
[1:53:56] telling them, I didn't come to you with
[1:53:58] this excellence of spirit,
[1:54:01] but I come to you in fear, but I would
[1:54:04] come that way. But I come to you knowing
[1:54:06] nothing
[1:54:09] but Christ,
[1:54:12] not with theology
[1:54:15] that I knew. I counted it as death,
[1:54:20] but I came to you knowing nothing
[1:54:24] but Christ.
[1:54:26] And Banam would say the biggest enemy
[1:54:31] that you need to fight
[1:54:33] is you
[1:54:36] because you always get in God's will.
[1:54:40] That's the one that gets lazy. He's the
[1:54:43] one that gets to a place sometimes where
[1:54:44] he thinks he can do something
[1:54:48] and he shoves God right out of the
[1:54:49] picture.
[1:54:52] But when I can get this guy out of the
[1:54:54] way,
[1:54:56] when I can get to a place where he is
[1:54:58] completely out of the way,
[1:55:01] then God can come over
[1:55:03] and do things that William
[1:55:06] knows nothing about and does things that
[1:55:10] knows nothing about.
[1:55:12] That's when God can use you.
[1:55:14] That's what he That's when he can use
[1:55:16] you, any any of you.
[1:55:22] He can use anybody
[1:55:24] when we get out of the way.
[1:55:27] But as long as we in the way,
[1:55:30] then he cannot use us.
[1:55:33] Let us stand on our feet.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:55:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, may God help us.
[1:55:43] God took Paul and made a slave out of
[1:55:45] him.
[1:55:48] He bound himself. bound him to himself
[1:55:51] and he sent him to the Gentiles
[1:55:54] which he hated.
[1:55:56] But you see, he had to lose Paul
[1:56:00] from his ecclesiastical power
[1:56:04] to be bound to the power of God.
[1:56:07] He had to lose his strength and become
[1:56:09] weak and nothing
[1:56:13] in order to receive the strength of God
[1:56:16] and be bound to God
