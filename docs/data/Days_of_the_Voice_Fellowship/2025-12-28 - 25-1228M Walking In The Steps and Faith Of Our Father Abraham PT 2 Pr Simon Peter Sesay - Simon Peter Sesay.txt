So whatever need that we have this morning, the abundant God is all sufficient and able to supply to supply. We have come to church to feast with the king to have fellowship with him that we may worship him. The reason why we worship is because you know we we believe that he's already doing something. Sometimes even before you receive your answer, you begin to to sing and worship and think about his goodness and then you begin to see it in the spirit happening and then it materializes after. That's where we receive our victory in worship. We believe he's going to minister to us today through the man of God. So before we usher him on the pool, I just like you to open your heart. Amen.

Saints as I'm going to usher the man of God on the platform. I just want to tell you something. Uh we had ministers here yesterday, some brothers and sisters that minister, you know, here at the church and and we we we had a quality time with a man of God, our precious brother Simon. &gt;&gt; And I just wanted to bring it to your attention. And if you don't mind standing, it's all right. Um because if you sit I may take long. &gt;&gt; Um it's only God who can do certain things. Um Pastor Simon did not prepare to be here this morning. It was not his plans. The plans that we had with him was for him to come and then go to Karamoja and then go back. But somehow things changed. God changed the program because God had a problem. I've been preaching on a subject, political maneuvers that obscure the vision. I have been trying I have been having a burden on my heart to uh you know tell you the vision of this church vision of the little ministry that God has given us and um pastor Simon came yesterday. He spoke to the brother uh the the the brethren that were here and he said many things. It was recorded. We can share it with whoever wants. We will not put it online. But there is something significant that he said prophetically without even knowing what we've been talking about. He said this. He said, "I see it." And if someone is streaming and not part of the church, please understand this is for Russia. He said, "I see it. I I when I look around you, I see the many that God is going to bless that they're going to God is going to bless them. And it was regarding, you know, our financial situation. He says, "God is going to bless you." And and the reason why he said that because he was going he was teaching us how to behave after the blessing of God. And he did not even know what the Lord had ministered to me. And I gave it to you here in one of the services about the the the poor old widow that had that did not have anything. And she came to the man of God, Elisha, and she said, "My I don't have anything. My husband is dead and I have de debts. I have a lot of debts. I need to pay them. I have nothing. Help me, man of God. My my my husband was a servant. And and the man of God told her, "What do you have?" She said, "I have a little cruise of weight." He said, "Okay, now go out, borrow, borrow as many vessels as you can and bring them here." And it was according to her ability. She borrowed as many vessels as she could as she could. And she brought them in empty vessels, not even hers. She borrowed them and brought them in. And uh you know the man of God now told her, "Take the oil and begin powering into into all these vessels." And the oil was little, but the oil like filled all the vessels. And the prophet of God told her, "Now take it out. Sell the oil." And after selling the oil, pay all your debts and the rest live on it. Pay all your debts and the rest live on it. And then out of there, the Lord gave me an inspiration for us. When we started out, do we have the board here? Now, the board, I don't know if the brothers brought the board. You know, the Lord gave me a vision. And and if you don't mind standing, it's okay. I'm standing too. So, don't think about that you're standing. And and so, you know, the Lord gave me that vision because we needed a huge sum of money. And we did not have brother Brian is the body here helped me to carry the body. And so the Lord gave me this vision. You know how we are going to raise our land. Amen. And and I told I told you it was just like I would call it a one. I said here's what the Lord wants us to do. Each of you give a pledge. The pledge you're going to give is going actually to be that empty vessel. You don't have it. You're borrowing. You're getting the vessel by faith. You're bringing the vessel. You're telling Lord, as for me, I'm going to give 2 million, one, 500. And Lord, this is what I am able to do. Okay, just a moment. You you can hold it. Just stand. Come come come right here. And and and then I told you um see and then I told you that uh once you give that empty vessel be don't pledge and be quiet. Pledge by faith. But there's something God has given to you. It may be small but it is your seed begin powering every week. Every week many of you have faithfully done it every week. Every week and I told you this and actually it wasn't me who told you that. I said watch if you do that faithfully. The moment you finish powering in, watch the blessing coming upon your business, upon whatever you have been doing. After I said it, I said to myself, Lord, those were not my words. It was your word, you will accomplish it. And here is a man from New York who didn't know about that at all. He said when I see here I see many of you are going to be what is that can only be God that can only be God and on Wednesday you know he was inspired to start the subject which I believe he's also going to continue with today I don't know and because he promised to us that he would continue with it very very important subject for our church at the stage where we are this is a man that god has used to start churches in Africa, West Africa where he came from then moved to the US and for more than I think 25 years a ministry there and and God has blessed it and God has blessed his work and he's in full-time ministry and I can say we are very honored as a church to have him here with us today. Can another brother, brother Brian, come on. This board will just be back in the back, but I just wanted you to visualize the vision for our land. And uh so yeah, there's going to be a little editing done because it's supposed to be 220. We started on zero. So you can see how we are progressing. We're going to have an indicator here. It will keep indicating where we are. Brother Joel, where are we now? Did you announce it today this morning? Do you have like the overall total out of 220? So I think we are about uh do you get did you get it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Sorry. He's checking it. Oh okay. So but I believe we should be around 140 something. We just we're just a few to go. I tell you what, if the Lord gives a vision, he accomplishes it. This was so huge for us. But the Lord has been faithful. And I tell you what, God bless you, brothers. I think I'll go now. You can just take it. Thank you. We just want now to go to the word. But I want you to know the purpose of this message is the change of our bodies, the rapture, going beyond the curtain of time, ruling with Christ. But while we are here, we are not aimless. God has called us for a purpose. And I believe this morning God is going to speak to you as an individual. Open your heart. Open your mind and expect God to speak to you this morning. How many came under expectation? Amen. I'm also under expectation. And Pastor Simon, thank you for sacrificing your time. I know there are many many places that would have wanted to have you this morning but you know you've labored among us. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Join me to tell him God bless you. Amen. Amen. So let us have a um a little song as our brother comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Oh to Jesus I surrender. Would you surrender all to him this morning? &gt;&gt; I will live life and trusting in his presence daily. &gt;&gt; I surrender. Sing it. &gt;&gt; I surrender. &gt;&gt; Lord, we surrender everything to you this morning. &gt;&gt; All our mind, all our thoughts. &gt;&gt; I surrender. Oh, &gt;&gt; come and speak to us this morning, Lord. To thee. I surrender. Bow our heads in prayer. &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father, we thank you this morning for this opportunity. you've given unto us once more &gt;&gt; to come into your presence &gt;&gt; to worship you. &gt;&gt; We ask that you will come this morning and help us. Give us grace to speak the oracles of God. Give us uncction. Give us utterance. &gt;&gt; Bless the interpreter, &gt;&gt; myself the congregation. Lord, I pray &gt;&gt; that you bless the pastor of this church, our brother, &gt;&gt; bless the offices, &gt;&gt; the government of the church. May you be with each and everyone. Come by our way and say something that will help us today in Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. want to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. I want us to read the scriptures. Then I have you seated. A very simple familiar scripture. St. John chapter 3 verse 16. I think it's a scripture we learn from Sunday school. But I trust that God will help us this morning. uh to uh just say something. &gt;&gt; Amen. John 3:16. &gt;&gt; For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. May God bless the reading of his word. Please take your seat. And Wednesday I was speaking to you on offerings and tithings. We just want to continue our thought on that because I realized that uh this is the area that God fights us so much sometimes. I mean the devil when you get the revelation and then it will bring the blessings of God upon your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; God himself, &gt;&gt; God will not ask you to do something that he himself doesn't do or has not done. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is a giver. Praise the Lord. Everything that we have need of, he gave us. &gt;&gt; He gave us life freely. In other words, he offered life to us. He gave us food. He gave us fishes. He gave us the air that we breathe in. He is a giver. The Bible says, "God so loved the world that he gave." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We spoke about the laws of God on Wednesday. God has put or place spiritual laws or natural laws and spiritual law. When you obey them, they'll work for you. There's a law of sewing and reaping. The Bible says you reap whatever you sow. God swed his son. That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. By the death of the Lord Jesus Christ today we are the fruits of that seed in sewing. You have to be careful what you sow. There are good seeds and there are bad seeds. There are certain seeds that we sow. Let's take for example an orange seed. It's just one seed &gt;&gt; you saw on the ground it comes forth. &gt;&gt; But that tree at a certain season it will bring forth fruit. That's right. And sometimes for a very long time, maybe for years and generations. We have to be careful what you sow because you will reap what you sow. God himself said, "The word that I speak, the word that I send out," because Jesus said, "The word is a seed." The word of God is a seed that a sen. And he said, "The word that I in the word that I send will not return unto me void. That's right. &gt;&gt; He did not say the word will not return or when it is coming back is not coming the same way is not it will it will come in abundance. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; When we look at the Mosaic law, the law of Moses, &gt;&gt; God has God brought the children of Israel out of Egypt. And when we look at the Old Testament, it seems everything about their worship is just offering, offering, offering. There was a burnt offering. There was a meal offering. There was a peace offering. There was a sin offering of purification. There was a trespass offering. There was a wave offering. There was a drink offering. There was a first fruits. These offerings were detailed in the Levit in the book of Leviticus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, God will judge a worship believer by the offerings they give. Amen. Amen. If your offering is accepted, then you are accepted. If your offering is rejected, then you are rejected. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; In the message, the prophet Elisha said, &gt;&gt; Elijah foreseen the shadow of Christ. Knowing that this meal represented him which it was the wave offering, the he offering, the meal offering and all the offerings pertained to Christ. Prophet of God said all of the offerings they were given were pertaining to Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we read in scripture, God so loved the world that he gave. Given is the character of God. Praise the name of the Lord. Life is a gift from God. Your home is a gift. If you are smart enough to get an education, who gave you that intelligence? &gt;&gt; It is God that gave you that intelligence. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the way you look at people and people are about to backslide sometimes you will see that it begin to reflect in their giving, their offer. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Giving must come from the heart. &gt;&gt; On Thursday we we spoke I mean Wednesday we spoke about how Amen. we should not give grudgingly. Wow. Every man according has a purpose in his heart. Let him give not grudgingly or of necessity. God love a cheerful giver. It becomes very difficult for people to give because the devil knows the law. &gt;&gt; Amen. The blessings that follows you when you give. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we read also where Cain and Abel coming to God presenting their offerings to God. And when we speak about offerings, we are not only looking at it from monetary terms. Amen. Our time is an offering to God. We give God praise offering, worship, special songs. They are all offerings we give to God. If somebody is playing the instrument, Amen. is making an offering to God. Can we say amen? Preaching is an offering also. That's right. &gt;&gt; When somebody's coming to pray, &gt;&gt; the song leader will say, "Can you please come and offer to God a prayer? Blessed be the name of the Lord." So there were many types of offerings. There was an incense offering also in the Bible which represented the prayers of the saints. Why did God demand so much? Because at that time in the Old Testament there was no Holy Ghost given to men. So the Holy Spirit will abide in men so that he can come and abide. The Holy Ghost was not abiding in him. The only way you can tell that this person is truly saved. It was his ability to give to God. That's right. God in the Old Testament, God was like, "Bring this, bring this, bring this." And in doing that, God was watching the soul of man and the condition of the heart. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When you make a gift to God, God will testify of your gift. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "By faith, Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain. which he obtained the witness that he was righteous. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The offering that Cain brought to God. Amen. It showed that he was a righteous man and God testified of his gift. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; God reckoned righteousness to Abel by an offering or sacrifice he brought to God. his gift and offering witness that he was a righteous man. The way you give God, whether it's your time, your time of coming to church, studying the word, your time to God's work testifies whether you are righteous or unrighteous. evil. &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; When a man says to God, I love you. I want to follow you. And God says to him, "Yes, well, I will show you a land." All right. He say, "I'll follow you then." And God at sometime will test his salvation by a demand for an extra thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; God will come to Abraham and say give me Isaac. And Abraham will say okay Lord. And the Lord will let him walk step walk every step of the way. So where he will actually offer Isaac as a sacrifice. That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Tithing, offerings is a commandment of the Lord. It started before Moses. Tithing is not an Old Testament law because it was our father Abraham who first gave tithing to Melkisedc. Are we together? By revelation I said on Wednesday when Mechisedc appeared to Abraham, he came as a priest to Abraham. And Abraham by inspiration knew that if this man is a priest, can we say amen? I need to pay tithe to the priest. Can we say amen? Later on, God will put it in the law. Are we together? And so we know that he told his church, the seed of Abraham &gt;&gt; to pay their tithes, Amen. to the priest. So when you are paying your tithe, you are not paying it to the pastor, but you are obeying a commandment of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the Bible, &gt;&gt; if you look at the Bible, &gt;&gt; God wanted tithing for everything. God wanted a tithe of even the people. He wanted a tithe of animals. He wanted a tithe of everything. Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; The reason why Israel did not ti give people as a tithe is because God have already taken Levi. Can I say amen? The tribe of Levi was a tight to God. Hallelujah. What am I trying to show you? When we are doing these things in the natural, we have more spiritual connotation to it. Can we say amen than just doing? Because when you obeying, you're obeying Christ. When the children of Israel went to Babylon, when they were coming back, &gt;&gt; God said, "A tenth, a tithe of those that went to Babylon will return." Only a tight Isaiah 6. The Bible says, "And and then said the Lord, how long And he answered, "Until the cities be wasted without inhabitants, and the houses without men, and the land will be utterly desolate, and the Lord have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land. For years yet in it shall attent and it shall return. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So God is saying that a tithe of Israel will return. Do you know that brother said God is going to take a tenth or a tide of all the human race. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me read a quote to you. He was praying in the message of Christ. He said, "Oh Lord, you are God. You are God forever more. And we are so happy to know that you promise that you have a remnant when you come to the earth regardless of what goes or come. There is going to be a people that's going to be ready. The prophet said, "We know that there is a tithing that man gives to God. And there is a tithing amongst the people. Perhaps maybe we will say a tenth of all the world's harvest through the ages will be the elected that's been called. Praise the name of the Lord. Very from the time of Eden to our time, it will be a tent. &gt;&gt; It will be a tight. Can we say amen? Of the human race that will be raptured that will be saved. &gt;&gt; So when you are bringing your tithe, the tithe is also speaking about you. Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; Because every scripture say if you read any scripture and you don't see Christ in that scripture, go and read it again. You never read it well. Christ is the word. Can we say amen? And you are a part of Christ. The bride is a tithe. the people that God is going to save. Can we say amen? They are tied for all humanity. &gt;&gt; So when God is saying, pay your tithes and offering, you must know what is more than just bringing. Hallelujah. Amen. It's a representation. May God help us &gt;&gt; in the message El Shadai said when you come to total obedience then you can have possession but until you totally obey you completely surrender your own thoughts your own will, your own mind. Let the mind of Christ operate in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; We are not called to obey a portion of the word and leave a portion. We are called to full obedience. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, &gt;&gt; this God that we serve, &gt;&gt; it keeps his word. &gt;&gt; I don't care if you are in a village. I don't care the circumstances you find yourself in. If you obey the word of the Lord, God will miss you where you are. God will bless you. Can we say amen? The blessings of God are not determined by the economy of the nation. It is determined by your obedience to the word of God. Because he said you will reap whatever you sow. Brother said total obedience to all of his commandments. will give you a right to the tree of life. The rich young ruler had a desire to enter into the kingdom. And so he went to Jesus, he said, "Good master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" He knew that he had kept the commandments for his heart told him you don't have eternal life. Just like some of us, we can attend services or in your heart, you are not really sure whether you are saved. So Jesus look at the young man. He said nobody's good but God alone. He said, "However, keep the commandments." The young man said, "I did since I was a boy." And Jesus looked at him. The Bible says he loved him. Let's think about that. A man that Jesus loved ended up in hell. Jesus said unto him, &gt;&gt; one thing you lack, if that you go and sell all that you have, give to the poor, come and follow me. I don't believe that God wanted the man or Jesus wanted the man to be poor. I don't think that God wanted him to remain with no home. If Jesus told him sell all and all means all, his house, his business, his chariot or cars. Can we say amen? Jesus said, "Sell all that you have. That would mean he's going to remain with nothing. He was going to remain with nothing. &gt;&gt; What was Jesus doing? &gt;&gt; Jesus was testing his obedience. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. When God came to Abraham in Genesis 22, he said, "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest." Amen. And get in the land of Moriah, and offer him therefore a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. God was asking an offering. Can you say amen? But the offering he was asking was a son of Abraham. Take thy son, thine only son, the one that you love. Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; When we are given God an offering, It must go with pain. &gt;&gt; If there is no pain to it, &gt;&gt; then it's not a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; When Abraham was willing to offer Isaac, It seemed as if Abraham was losing. He waited for this boy for 25 years. God who gave him the son said now I want you to offer him to me. When God has blessed us, we never have a job. God give you a job. God gave you a hope. God has blessed you. God's word is telling you offer. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You have a building project. Can you say amen? And you have made pledges and and and and and some of you are given. Some of you well, you give sparingly. You give once in a while. Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; But God want to bless you. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; God want to prosper you. For God walk according to his laws. Salvation. Salvation is free. Salvation is unmmerited. Salvation is grace. Brother said the blessings of God, there are conditions attached to it. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. And so God is asking Abraham. God was testing Abraham and every son of God, every daughter of God that comes to God will be tested by God. He told the children of Israel, &gt;&gt; "Silver and gold is mine, &gt;&gt; if I'm hungry, &gt;&gt; I will not ask you for food because I own everything." Can we say amen? When you are given to God, you are acknowledging that he is the creator of the heavens and the earth. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Abraham &gt;&gt; when Melisedc &gt;&gt; appeared to him and Melisedc &gt;&gt; introduce himself as the possessor of the heaven and the earth. Abraham realized that whatever he has received, Amen came from God. And therefore, I'm acknowledging whatever you have given me. Whatever I have today is coming from you. I'm giving you offering. I'm giving you a tithe. I'm worshiping you. Can we say amen by giving you this offering? I &gt;&gt; I want us to change our mentality about giving everyday pledge. Every day offering everyday I think I will leave this church. The pastor is asking too much money. It's not the pastor &gt;&gt; is the Holy Ghost. The children of Israel when they left Egypt before they left, God gave a promise to Abraham. He said when they are coming out they will come with a great success. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; Actually God made Egypt to pay for all the years of slavery. When the hour came for them to leave, God moved upon the Egyptians. they begin to borrow. You can go into a man's house and say, "Can you give me a million dollars?" If they have that money, they will give it to you. When Israel came out, they came out with gold different different things. Can we say amen? And they crossed over. Are you hearing me? After they came out in the process of time, they wanted to build a temple. God who gave them those things came back through the prophet to tell them to bring gold to give offerings. Can we say amen of what he has blessed them with? When you come to the realization that whatever you have come from God, you say amen, you will give to God unrely. And the Bible says they gave so much until the priest had to stop them from giving by the prophet. We must be willing &gt;&gt; to give God our time. &gt;&gt; What did Paul say? He said, "Offer yourself as a living sacrifice, &gt;&gt; holy and acceptable." Amen. When you are given an offering, it must be holy. If it is not holy, it will not be acceptable. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Amen. Prayer without ceasing. &gt;&gt; Prayer, you offer prayer to God. &gt;&gt; It is the will of God. in Christ Jesus concerning you. He said, "Rejoice in the Lord always and again I say rejoice." Jesus said, "Love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy mind, with all thy strength." Can we say amen? So when we are serving God, we serve God with our strength. We serve God with everything that is in us. Hallelujah. When we are coming to church, we should come with all our hearts. David said, I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord because in the house of the Lord, there is healing. In the house of God, there is deliverance. In the house of God, there is the Holy Ghost. Blessed be the name of the Lord. That is why we come. When we are worshiping, we sing from our heart. Can we say amen? We are not singing for the pastor. We are not singing for the song leader. We must worship him. We must worship him with all our heart. When you are playing the instrument, it's an offering to God. You must play this instrument with all of your heart. Can we say amen? When you are sweeping is an offering, it's a service to God. Do it with all your heart. Praise the name of the Lord. Don't complain. Don't grumble. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You know in Mark chapter 12, Jesus went to the temple. Uh he sat against the treasury. They were putting money which came and they put money. The Bible says there came a certain poor woman and she throw in two m which make a father. He called him unto his disciples and said unto him, them, verily I say unto you, this poor widow have cast more in than all they which have cast into the trench. For all they did cast of their abundance, she of her wanting all that she had and all her living Jesus. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; You see, the little that you have, put it in the hand of Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now these things must be by revelation. You cannot give and go out grumbling. If I don't if I don't pledge, you know, everybody will know that I'm not pledging. You try to pledge, you go out complaining. God will never bless you. It's better not to even give. That's right. &gt;&gt; This widow, people were giving. People were giving maybe 10,000, maybe 50,000. But then when she came, she only gave two. But what she gave was all that she had. For you to give all that you have, it has to be by divine revelation. Blessed be the name of the Lord. She gave all. And Jesus said, "This woman has given more than all the people." Can we say amen? When you are giving to God, give your all. &gt;&gt; If you are giving your time, give all of your time. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are giving offering, let it come from your heart. Can you say amen? When you are paying the tithe, let it come from your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes there are people that come to church. They don't have nothing. They come, they will start with a ministry as as young as you people. All of you are young. that the pastor will labor, pray for them, preach to them. God begin to bless them. They get good jobs. They get, you know, they are blessed. They up there and now they have a very big salary. And when they look at the money, they think that the tithing is too much for the pastor. May God help us. It's a lack of revelation. In fact, that money that money is not your money. The tithe is not your money, the tithing is money. Can I say amen? If you are not faithful in paying your tithe, if you are not faithful in paying your offerings, if you are not faithful in doing the things of God, hallelujah, God will not bless you. You will not receive the blessings. If you want the blessings of God, you should come to obedience to the word of God because it is a law of God. &gt;&gt; We have to be careful what we do in church. &gt;&gt; Ananas and Safaria died. What caused their death? is because of offering and place. They were making pledges to people were selling their land. They were bringing it to the apostles. Be careful. They went and they sold their land. And they kept some of the money. &gt;&gt; Apostle Peter was not there, but the Holy Ghost was there that day. But Ananas came to church. Sister Ananas was late. He came. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm pledging this amount of money. And whatever he said, Peter looked at him. Brother Ananas, this money you have been going to pledge, &gt;&gt; is that all that you sold the land? Maybe. I'm saying maybe. Maybe he told the apostles that I'm going to sell the land wherever I sold the land for I'm going to bring the money. But probably when he sold the land, he look at the money. Ah, this is too much. And she he and the wife agreed. Maybe an never fulfill his pledge. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he made a pledge. &gt;&gt; Sometimes God give you the money, &gt;&gt; but you use it for other things and you bring in a little. Peter said, Why has Satan filled your heart to lie against the Holy Ghost and when he was exposed he dropped dead the brothers took him and bury him that means they never even stopped the service maybe some deacons Peter went service was going on Ananas, it's not good to come to church late. If she was there on time, she would have known what had happened. Oh my my. &gt;&gt; So maybe that day she put on her best clothing to put a show in church. &gt;&gt; Wore the best shoes. because they just sold a lot. Maybe she bought the most expensive dress. She came walking, you know, walking to church because she wanted everybody to be in church. So that when she walk now to give the testimony, she did not know what happened. Peter said, "Sister, &gt;&gt; is this money your brother, you your your husband brought? Is it that you guys sold money?" Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. He said, "The same feet that bury your husband, they're just at the door. She fell and died. &gt;&gt; We have to be very careful what we do in church. &gt;&gt; This is very simple. Brother said the days of Ananas the days of Ananas and Safar will come again. in this message. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; May God help us. I say may the Lord help us. Prophet of God said we should not forsake to assemble. ourselves together as the manner of some is in a message. What a v what visions are. He said we feel that every person is duty bound to attend some church. You belong to some church as a Christian. Many people say, "Oh, I stay home and read my Bible. I'm just as well off." No. The Bible said we should not forsake to assemble ourselves together. We've got to do that. We've got to stand together. And all the churches, can we say amen? Let me tell you, I understood here that in Uganda that you people are afraid of rain. Can we say amen? But let me tell you, you as a believer, don't let the rain stop you from coming to a church. That is a sacrifice. That is a sacrifice. When God see your sacrifice, God will bless you. Years ago, I told some people, you know, in where it was raining so much, I told her, I said, brothers, if you are if it's raining, if you have a bag or plastic bag or something, put another clothes there. If you have to walk in the rain, walk in the rain. When you go to church, change your clothing and worship God. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. We must show God that we are serious about the things of God. Blessed be the name of the Lord. If it is a spirit in the nation, if that is the spirit that is ruling the nation, it should not rule you. Hallelujah. You are Christians. Overcome that spirit. Don't say well I will stay home and and and watch and watch and watch. You know we have online services. Can we say amen? God said don't forsake. Don't forake to assemble yourself. &gt;&gt; May God help us. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I said when you see a person that struggles in giving tithe and offering there's their spiritual condition is not good when we give God how do we give God you see brother Benham said, &gt;&gt; "God deserve our best." &gt;&gt; In Malachi 1:6, &gt;&gt; God was closing the Old Testament with a complaint. He say, "A son honorth his father." A son honors his father. Malachi 16. A son honorth his father and a servant is master. If I if then I be a father, where is mine honor? If I be a master, where is my fear? Say the Lord of hosts unto you. Oh priests that despise thy name. And you say wherein have we despised thy name? God was making a complaint. He said you people have despised me. You don't honor me. You don't fear me. You say you ask how did did we despise your name? Let's look at verse seven. He say you offer polluted bread upon mine altar. You say wherein have you polluted thee? You say the table of the Lord is contemptable. Hallelujah. To despise is to hold in contempt. To be contemptable is to despise. So they were given offerings. All was complaining of the offerings that they were given. Can we say amen? They were given their offerings but they were bringing polluted bread. Brother said God deserve your best. Sometimes even when we want to give offering, we look among the dirty money, the one that is dirty. That is why we give to God. He said you offering polluted bread upon my altar. If you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? If you offer the lame and the sick, is it not evil? You offer it now to your governor, will he be pleased with thee? Or accept thy person, say the Lord of hosts. Amen. &gt;&gt; Though they were given offerings, when a man will go among his sheep, he knows he's supposed to bring offering. He will take the one that is lame. The weak one, the one that is not of a value, that's the one that he will take. and bring to a church for offering or he take a lamb that is blind and he take that and use that to offer it to God for offering. God was very angry. God was not happy with that. He said you are giving me an offering like that. Can you give your governor such an offering? You are in contempt. God held them in contempt. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; When we are coming to church, brother say come to church in your best. Sometimes we just limit it to clothing. That's good. We should dress well and come to church. But you see, it's beyond that. When you are coming to church, you must come in your best. You must be in your right frame of mind. Can we say amen? You don't come to church and you are sleeping in church. You are not in your best. You're not giving God your best. You don't come to church. The pastor is preaching and your mind is wearing. Praise the name of the Lord. You are coming to church. You are thinking about food. You are coming to church. You are thinking about your job. Can we say amen? We should come to church in our best. Present yourself. Present yourself as a living sacrifice. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When we come in our best, &gt;&gt; when we offer God the best praises, the best songs, can we say amen? That is why. May God help us not to bring the denominational way of worship. There's a way we should worship God. There's a way we should play the trumps. There's a way we should play the instruments. It must be acceptable. Can we say amen? Don't put a rock and roll beat. May God help us. May God help us. May God give us grace. Those that worship God must worship him in spirit and in truth. So they will go to their farms and say this one is not good. That's what I'm going to give to church. God is saying if you offer the blind to your governor, is it not evil? Will your governor be pleased? May God help us. God is taking a sacrifice brought by a person. God is looking at an offering that somebody brought to church and he's judging it for evil or for good. As a man thinkketh in his heart, &gt;&gt; so he may God help us. Brother Bham said this. He said is worthy of the best. &gt;&gt; What do you do for him? Give him the leftover. I tell my people all the time, &gt;&gt; when you know that tomorrow is Sunday, &gt;&gt; go to bed early. Rest your body well. Hallelujah. So that you can come to church in your best. Do you know that said you can prostitute your time all night you are online in China you're in India you're over here and over there from website to website to website you don't sleep you sleep for two hours you've given your time so the internet You come to church. You come to church very tired. You come to church. You are sleeping. You are giving God your leftover. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Oh yes. You can run around all day. Give him 3 minutes at night before you go to bed. Some of us don't even have a prayer life. Can we say amen? For the church to go on, for the church to overcome, you need a people that are praying. Can we say amen? We fight our battles on our knees. When we are praying, Amen. He moves heaven. When Daniel was praying, &gt;&gt; can we say amen? Daniel was praying. &gt;&gt; Amen. The day he started praying, that they started praying, God sent angel Gabriel. There are there are demons. There are powers that are ruling over cities. There are demons that are ruling over villages. There are spirits, hallelujah, amen, unseen forces. But when you go on your knees, he begin to make an offering of prayer. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Heaven begin to move. God begin to dispatch angels. Can we say amen? God begin to do greater things. May God help us. We should have time to pray. Have a prayer life. Have a prayer life. Have a time set aside. God, I'm going to give you this x amount of time every day as an offering. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Things will begin to change. Miracles will happen. The supernatural will begin to move. Blessed be the name of the Lord. When you hear the word, when you hear the word, when you go home, find some time to pray. Can you say amen? Oh Lord, help me Jesus. Help me this area. Pray for your pastor. Pray for the officers. Pray for the ministers. Pray for the church. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Offer your prayers. God is looking for prayer warriors. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; Today we become lazy Christians. It wasn't so from the beginning. It doesn't matter where you are. It doesn't matter where you are. Daniel was in Babylon. Some of you maybe came from the village. He came to Campala. Can we say amen? There are demons that are ruling campala. Remember you are a Christian. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; You must be above. &gt;&gt; Prophet said he deserves your best. He deserves everything you got. But what do you do about it? You give him just anything. Prophet said, he takes it. He takes it anyhow. He takes it. This woman, this woman who was a prostitute that went saw Jesus, they have invited him. They never worship you. They never they never wash his feet. When the woman observed that she ran to the shop and she went when when she went to the shopkeeper, she says, "Sir, give me the best of your oint your your your perfume." It was a very expensive perfume. Can we say amen? She bought that and came to Jesus. And when she came to Jesus, she begin to weep and took her long hair, wiped the feet of Jesus and anointed Jesus with her expensive perfume. Can you say amen? because of our action, because of her offering that gave her eternal life, it gave her eternal life. Jesus said, "Wherever this gospel, because of what you did, because of your offering, because of the way you treated me, because of your gift, wherever this gospel is preached, your name will be mentioned. Praise the name of the Lord. I'm sad. &gt;&gt; Give your best to give him your best. Give him the best of your life. Remember now your creator days of your youth. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Young sisters, don't allow any serpent seed to defy you. Don't sell yourself because of money. young man. You may be in an office where maybe your manager or supervisor is a lady because of the anointing upon you. The devil want to take that anointing and begin to entice you. Praise the name of the Lord. Stand like Joseph. Stand like Joseph. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Stand for God. Give him the best of your life. &gt;&gt; Most of you are young people. Can you say amen? You have strength. You have energy. Give that strength to the Lord Jesus Christ. Give your time to reading and praying. Stop looking at nude women on the internet. &gt;&gt; You're here feeding your spirit on naked women, feeding your spirit on dirty things and you come to church on Sunday and you raise your hand. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's hypocrisy. Can I say amen? &gt;&gt; Present yourself. as a living sacrifice, &gt;&gt; holy and acceptable. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. May God help us. May the Lord help us. May the Lord give us grace. Give him your best. Give him the best of your life. You will never regret. serving the Lord. Hallelujah. God will owe no man anything is a rewarder. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He said not even given a cup of cold water will go unrewarded. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In every age he say I know your works. May God help us. If we take that attitude, God will begin to do supernatural things. The blessings of God will come over your life. The blessings of God will come over your children. The blessings of God, the protection of God. Can you say amen? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Melchisedc &gt;&gt; called Abraham. &gt;&gt; He said, "I am your shield. &gt;&gt; I am your shield. Any exceeding great reward, God will be your protection." Can we say, "Amen. Though I walk through the valley of shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me." &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Give your life, &gt;&gt; give your strength, give your money, &gt;&gt; give your soul, give your spirit as an offering to the almighty God. God is looking for young men. God is looking for young women. Hallelujah. That will serve him that will serve him with all of their heart. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Abraham said she poured the oil upon his feet and the whole the whole room lit up with it. It was costly. He said there is nothing too good for Jesus. There is nothing too good for Jesus. Give him your best. Give him everything you got. Your life, your soul, your being, your time, all that you have. Give him to him. Give it to him. Don't say the prophet. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; God delights in a cheerful giver. Brother Benham said when she went to that man who was selling, she said, "Kind sir, I I want the best alabaster box you got in the store. I want not one, but I want the best you got. The way your best. He deserves your best. The best you got. He said we give him the seconds. We give him the last. Do you know the Bible says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God." &gt;&gt; God must be first in everything. When you with when you get your paycheck, the first thing that is supposed to come out of your check is your tithe. That's right. After you give your tithe, I have given too much there are free will offerings. Look, if a man makes a farm, and just plant seeds from here to here. How much would he expect when harvest come as opposed to somebody who will sow seed all over the place? The more you give, the more God blesses you. The more you get out of the harvest. May God help us. Brother Benham said, &gt;&gt; he loved brother Benham. &gt;&gt; We love the prophet. He said, "You take your first, go out and spend and have big times." And then when you go to church on Sunday morning, you give him a quarter. But you go out $50 present to give to the Joneses that live next door to you or something enough or something enough to get up in your society. right to give Jesus the last. He deserves your best. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus deserves everything that you are and all that you got. That's the reason we can't get nowhere. When you never had a car, oh God, bless me with a car. Lord, if you bless me, I will use it for the work of God. God will answer your prayer. He gives you the car. You watch what you will do. The Bible says, "Don't be hasty to speak. You make a vow. Pay your vows. &gt;&gt; God has given a vehicle. The pastor says go. Can you go and pick that sister or that brother? Now the road is too bad. You're looking at the gas. You are looking at your vehicle. The vehicle has become an idol. You see your brothers passing along the road. &gt;&gt; Your church brother, you act as if you don't see them. May God help us. Prophet of God said, everything that you got, give it to him. He said this is the reason we can't go nowhere. Yeah. God gave you a nice home when the people come for the meetings and they say go and just can can you keep some brothers especially when he come from the village. Yeah, these villagers. &gt;&gt; But you forgot where you came from. &gt;&gt; We need to change our attitude. &gt;&gt; May God help us. I've seen also that it's a problem all over. Sometimes when it comes to offering, people give little sometimes you see people give $1 or one sheet. They come to church. There's money there. When they taking the offering, they look for the little note. How do you expect God to bless you? God was telling them, "What are you thinking about me? Look at the kind of offerings I hope by the time I I come next time, &gt;&gt; I will hear good testimonies. Hallelujah. Amen. Do you do you love the Lord today? &gt;&gt; May the name of the Lord be praised. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. May God help us. &gt;&gt; Now coming to church is an offering is a service. There are people who have just made up their minds. Is not only here but you find that problem everywhere. that they will only come to church on Sunday. All right. Sometimes there are circumstances. But serving God is a sacrifice. Some don't live far from church yet they make excuses. When the brethren are praying, what are you doing at home? &gt;&gt; On the internet. Praise the Lord. May God help us. Let's serve God with everything that is in us. He deserve your worship. He deserve your life. He deserve hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let the devil know that we are the people of God. We are here to worship God. &gt;&gt; If you don't worship God, you worship something. May God help us. &gt;&gt; God deserve your best. God deserve the best of your time, the best of your money, the best of everything, if you apply those laws. Sometimes you see people that apply the laws of God and God begin to bless them. Some people in the church become jealous the spirit of jealousy &gt;&gt; is the spirit of king. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God told Ken, "See what your brother Abel have done. Why can't you do the same thing? Amen. &gt;&gt; If you do the right thing, &gt;&gt; God will do nothing but bless you. &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; May God give us grace. God bless you. Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you. Amen. Oh god. Amen. Amen. Amen. How many have been blessed tonight? Amen. I believe every one of us has been blessed. You know, we I can rehearse everything that the pastor said. Something that I uh you know, one or two things that I just want to just rehearse to you tonight. See, salvation is free. Blessings are conditional. Did you hear that? Salvation is free. Blessings are so you can be saved. You can be a good believer but struggling in your life. But all because you've not met God's conditions. Amen. Recently, I'm I've met several very many brethren and the pastor said that many times when someone is backsliding, one of the first thing that you see is that the the area of their giving goes down. They no longer come to church as they used to. They no longer want to sing as they used to. They now sit in the back. When the song leader says, "Let's clap our hands." It's a clap offering. They don't want to give that. They don't want to sing. Every time is you for you. The key is wrong. The key is wrong. You know, you find that they don't want to give offerings. You know, some of of some of you have pledged and you've completely done nothing on your behalf. I have people here, young people that have given pledges. Some of them are about to finish their pledge. And you find others who would have given more. It's not priority. But I think after this service, things are going to change. Amen. what we had yesterday and what we had this morning. You see, and these things are not his ideas. He read these quotes for us on Wednesday in the reproach for the cause of of the word says God made a promise that he would bless. Amen. Tell your neighbor, God made a promise that he would bless. But now listen to this. But them blessings are under condition. And you have got to meet those conditions to make that work. In the influence, he says all promises of God are true, but they are unconditional. No matter how much how fundamentally right we are, we've got to approach it the right way. Now, men can be fundamentally right. and still not receive the blessings of God because they're good believers but they not because it's approached because it's approached in the wrong way. It goes upon conditions. We've seen those who are not even believing this message. They apply these principles and God blesses them. Let's apply the principles. We are believing the message and we applying these principles to meet the conditions of God. God will send blessings out. So if your business is is suffering, please praying is good is a part of giving but give your time. Come to church on Wednesday. It's a sacrifice. Close your your your your business and come to church. It's only two hours here plus one hour of traveling. Three hours. people who know their God will do that. May God, Amen, bring us to that level of revelation. You see, I've I've seen uh brethren that have caught that revelation and God always blesses you. But you see, you may stay at your business, you will not close and customers will not come and then you will call the pastor to pray for you. But you are sowing the wrong seed. and reaping the wrong harvest. Sow the right seed and you will reap the right harvest. The Muslims no matter whether and you you know they they usually busy at their place of work but when it is time for prayer they don't care how many people are lining up to them priority their God you will find him the man is there kneeling down and praying one time before I knew what they do I went to one of their shops said, "Yes, and I did not I was young. I did not know that the man was praying. I thought he must come and sell to meep." He didn't mind about it. He doesn't even care whether someone steals or anything, whether he's losing money. The only thing he's caring about is now it's time for prayer. But the Christians &gt;&gt; when it's time for work &gt;&gt; service I will go on Sunday even on Sunday they will come late they will work until very late on Saturday and go at home there's a lot of things to do you are too tired then you come here Sunday morning too tired the pastor is preaching but everything is going over your God has spoken to us. May we take what we have been, what we have heard. Total obedience will lead you to possession. You know, I love the way the pastor talks about a rich young ruler. You know, he could not possess life because he never totally obeyed. When he came to Jesus, he told him, "Good master, what can I do to inherit eternal life?" And Jesus answered him, and this always moves me. He answered him and he said, "Why do you call me good? Only God." In other words, you must know that you have come to me. You must know that I am God. And the scripture says, "All that come to God, all that come to God must know that he is and is a reward for those that diligently seek." This man came seeking after you, but he never came willing and ready to obey. He never obeyed and he lost life. He could not possess it. When you come to a total obedience, then you can have possession. But until you totally obey, you've got to completely surrender your own thoughts, your own will, your own mind, and let the mind of Christ operate in you. Do you think Christ would the mind of Christ in you would say the days of miracles is passed or do you think the mind of Christ in you would say the Bible is right in some places and not in others? The mind of Christ would sanction every word that Christ ever said. How many say amen to that? So don't use your own mind. Use the mind of Christ. How many say that what we have heard this morning is the mind of Christ. Amen. God deserves our best. I'm leaving this service this Sunday morning. Resolve to give God my best. My best worship. My best dressing when I come to church. It's not pride, friends. It is giving God your best. my best time. My best giving I want to be the best financial giver, supporter to the church, to the work of the ministry. My best singing. Praise God. And we have a testimony here from one of the brothers here. Amen. The hand of the Lord is uh in our lives. A testimony from brother Allan and gratitude to the leadership of the saints to the to the leadership and the saints of the living God for the prayers and support. Praise the Lord saints of the living God. Amen. He says, "Praise the Lord. I want to thank the Lord Jesus for his faithfulness. After a long time of waiting and prayer, the Lord has answered us. The pastor said he will always answer. If you pray, he always answers. But after he has answered, you don't have to forget him. What we have today is something friends. So this is a testimony. He has answered us and blessed me him with a job. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. My dear wife and I truly saw the hand of God. He passed us through when the way seemed closed. We also sincerely thank the saints of the living God and the leadership for the favven prayers and support offered on our behalf. Truly those prayers were not in vain. We have availed much in our lives. To everyone who stood with us during the waiting season, encouraged us and prayed for us. May the Lord richly bless you. We give him all the glory, honor, and praise. Amen. Amen. Amen. And to some of you who are also still waiting, maybe you're in a waiting season, I say he will come through for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Quite frankly, I believe that as believers, we should not struggle to get what to eat. We should not struggle get transport to church. We should not struggle to get clothes. We should not struggle to pay our school fees. Those things should not be a struggle because those are needs. He promised to give to provide all our needs. according to his riches in glory. But there are principles and if this church and one thing that I I heard also the pastor say it doesn't matter where you are. This principle applies everywhere. In the village, in the city, in America where the pastor comes from, in Uganda, it applies the same principle. Practice it in your life. Practice it in your family and you will watch the blessing of God. Can I have an amen on that? Amen. Let us stand on our feet. Just try to close the service. We have another service this afternoon at over at Pastor Bima. And so all those that can make it this afternoon, you're welcome to do it. Uh I also don't know the directions very well. I've been there years ago. &gt;&gt; I think you've been there recently. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can you give the people directions? International. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Have we understood? All right. So, God bless you. We're going to be there, I think, from around 300 p.m. or 2:04, something like that. &gt;&gt; And that would be the last service for uh uh Pastor Simon and afterwards he will travel back to New York tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh Amen. So Majesty Majesty come and help me. Let us sing this as we we just uh uh give and uh we'll have brother we'll have you brother Baka come and pray for us shortly. Amen. Otherwise I just want all of us to say together to pastor Simon tell him raise up your hand and say God bless you. God bless you. Tell him thank you for coming. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you for coming. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Your your Amen. Let us sing your grace. Your grace. Your grace has found me just as I am. Ooh. Emptyhanded but alive in your hand.

We thank you, Lord, for the gift of life you've given us as a church. We thank you Lord for the minister that you brought to us far from you Jesus. We thank you Lord for your ways for your ways and not the ways of man. Father King of God for we have heard your word and we pray that let that seed that has been swed in us today germinate and Lord that that word will bear fruits and father that the fruits will be faithful. The fruit father king of glor shall be onto us. Father king of glory shall help us and help the church to grow. Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for you have brought your word today. Father king of glory I can't forget yesterday when I was praying. I pray that Lord for everyone who have questions that Lord you provide answers for Lord I believe in this congregation there are people who have been having questions about their financial stability. I'm sure Lord that you have answered our questions. &gt;&gt; I have no doubt in that Lord. Lord when we called you father king of glor you have answered the prayer. And those who go by what you have told us, I have no doubt that you will answer their prayers. &gt;&gt; Father, Lord, as we are leaving this place, pray that Lord, you come and go with us. Go with us to our places of abboard. But Father, you even keep us where we stay. Those who are traveling, Father, King of God, I pray for Jesus. Lord, as we're ushering into a new year, may you be with us, Lord Jesus. Let no one of us, Father King fail to enter in a new year, be with us, Lord, in our families. Father, I remember my wife who is sick at home. I pray Lord for a healing. Father, even if there's anyone in this congregation who is not feeling well and is sick, demanding for healing, may you grant it, Lord, for by your stripes we are healed. We pray all this believing in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. I tell you saints before we dismiss uh there probably some of you who have been going through I know I know not probably but I know going through situations and maybe you feel that you are in a very sorry state you need help the answer like brother Andrew prayed the answer from the mind of God is that give &gt;&gt; and it shall be given to And giving is not only money. We've had all the giving. Maybe you want to go back and listen to this first the Wednesday service, the Sunday service, listen to it again. Maybe the brothers will cut a few so we can rehearse on those things. My myself before I got married, I was a giver. After I got married, I've been a giver. My family and my wife and I and the family, we have been givers. But I can tell you what, we've seen the blessing of God because the things we do, we don't know how we are able to accomplish. We do it by faith. But I know that God honors his word. God honors his word. So the Lord bless you and give you a wonderful week. We're going to meet on Wednesday. at uh at uh 5:00 p.m. &gt;&gt; for our night first of all communion service. So come prepared for that.
