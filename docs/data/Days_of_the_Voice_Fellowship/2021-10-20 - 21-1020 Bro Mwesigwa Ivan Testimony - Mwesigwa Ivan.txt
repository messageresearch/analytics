give us 500 children we could buy a doughnut and then we share the doughnuts and then we go to the borah we drink water with the donut and we finish the day even the following day let me tell you brethren you will never the truth god he is a businessman but at the first he looks at you and see [Music] there are times when you grumble while you're going through certain situations those situations are there for you sometimes sometimes god is testing you know immediately to see whether you will stand will keep you there i was preaching a message which was saying that the purpose will keep you yes the purpose which brought you will keep you there that if you came to church to seek for help when there will be no more help you look back in the world if you go to church because you have people who love you the day they will hurt you will go back to the world purpose will keep you there but the purpose why you came to church will keep you in the church amen [Music] [Music] he

work for you he can bring something in any way anyhow can just do it any way he can do anything by you let me go to the last city the lord saved me from an accident there were some people around who

were in town again as i negotiated the corner nowhere now [Music] okay and i put and three the motorcycle went home now yeah sir but the one in our industry will never have the two passengers both of them my shirt is still there as a testimony it is in pieces with the bread now here's the saffron there is no devil who can fight god is the purpose in you god had a purpose in you he was born for a purpose even even the accident wouldn't have killed me because i was meant to stand here today it was fun for a purpose again he was born foreign you are here for a purpose you are not here as the flower you are here for a purpose nothing can take you away regardless you get so sick because you are here for a purpose even if you get sick to the death point you're gonna your parents couldn't abort you because god had a purpose and others died amen amen myron berry pastor at two miles a month this year last year in a ginger at a place called the two miles madonna and then he stopped ah [Applause] they bewitched me they sent it to a pigeon they sent a pigeon in witchcraft it was last year and i said lord you gave goliath in the hands of david i want you to give me this god once i hit it and it felt that important and i got a penguin and i cut it i cut it in pieces record [Music] even there was no nothing was there even ash it just disappeared that thing never attacked us anymore why are you talking about after three days and so we went to the graveyard of swansea today but pray for us we are dying i said i forgive you kneel down i pray for you okay organic [Music] amen i mean it's good for us to hear you know the bible says that some through the waters some through the fire but if you are a believer of this message like the brothers say the purpose of god has to see you through god no matter what the devil does sing songs i cannot take you before your time you remember when they came here i think it was the other week but you cannot sign the weekend talk something about the purpose is [Music] oh in that generation will fight and they will have to overcome avant mode so that they can be called overcomers of course amen and has to be accomplished whether the devil likes it or not imagine this brother being knocked twice [Music] again i don't know if some of you know a brother pastor called gary walker simon i'm assuming if you want this testimony you can search it on a you can put testimony of gary walker on youtube you'll get it in australia australia he has a similar testimony he was driving there they said that that had to be a miracle and he was there with his family [Music] he came out alive navajo that reminded me as the brother was speaking it reminded me of the testimony of john uganda john was banned in oil [Music] and the man did not burn and they said he's a witch so they asked the brother are you sure you are alive [Music] you know in an accident you can die and then you were about to speak sir ah the man almost killed me when you actually already did it one man told him he said the man is dead he just doesn't know yet that's why they were they were asking him if you are if indeed you are alive do this is why because there is still a purpose in his life which was to be achieved i believe one of us is for him to be here to share these stories i'll just read this [Music] he went down and fought through all kinds of impersonations of janice and jambress i'm he comes out of egypt going up to the promised land where god said you will worship me on this mountain [Music] so yeah yeah you'll get the listen to these words yes he says no pharaoh can kill him father was a he is so we are on our road to glory hallelujah i mean that's why it's wonderful to hear such a a wonderful testament on this wonderful road to glory because moses was pre-destinated kuwangan no and the will of god nothing is going to stop us no sir say what do you want god is going to vindicate his wife since then you know twice i just said this when i was in china when are you china you know when they arrest you there and you're preaching to chinese it's not allowed they just you know you know you are gone you just speak guys just saw a chicken but still the intelligence they know so they usually have spikes everywhere so believe us they usually together in believers homes i think it was about the 10th or 15th floor somewhere around him this chinese even the way they behave inside so when they knock something they just behave as if they had a meeting a family meeting but in this case i was a foreigner and we had bibles everywhere let them kill me when i have let me preach my best again something good about when you know you are on the line of duty and you you are where you are supposed to be oh my gosh is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] grab the food in the house of their brother let us not even talk about the tournament let us talk about brother ivan here we are if you need food anything that you have because he still had a purpose again that is very encouraging to us god is our provider because we are the bride of jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the lord let us stand on our feet come and appreciate our brother ivan i'm going to fight her amen [Music] [Music] [Music] he's a minister of church and so he has a responsibility but when i came to message grace introduced me to many them because the people one of the people i saw earlier because he was the best man of my past best emanuela [Music] this [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] let us [Music] before we sing the song i think we should break us up our preacher's heavenly father step forward you mean so much to us especially to know who we are we are not just a church literally but [Music] truly baker never come on father these these things they just make us feel special because of your presence i pray that you'll continue to shower that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] lord we pray even as we shall be leaving
