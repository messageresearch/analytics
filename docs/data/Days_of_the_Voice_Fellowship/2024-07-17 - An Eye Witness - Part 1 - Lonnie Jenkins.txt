TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome to Global answers please join us as we discuss the relevance of God's eternal word relating to events in this day and what it means to you and now your host Lonnie Jenkins Hello friends I'm Lonnie today we have a very special guest very old friend of mine uh Rend Ed bcll a missionary a pastor and many other titles and you'll get acquainted with him in a moment but first I wanted to tell you a little bit about reminding you about this age and himself so that you'll appreciate more what we're going into today we've spoken to you many times about a special message at the end time and how that God is going to unveil the mysteries of God in the last days and we know from the many many scriptures many of which we've rehearsed with you before that the word of the Lord comes to the prophet so God had to in restoration send a prophet and in that sending of a prophet Prophet it has to be from the scripture from the Bible otherwise he's just another man with another opinion of what's going on in the world today but when God sends a man he thoroughly vindicates I am with this man so consequently I wanted to talk to you just a moment now God uses this Spirit of Elijah five times Spirit of Elijah we're talking about now five times we find that it came on Elijah Elisha we know from scripture it came on John the Baptist and I'll jump one and in Revelations 11 we see the works of Elijah and Moses in a Ministry when God turns his heart back to the Jews again but in between those two is a Ministry of an Elijah to this age to forerun this second coming of the Lord to forerun what he himself called the coming word and so we can divide between these two I took the time to print out from my computer so that we could divide because most people uh tie together the scriptures that apply to Elijah of this age William brandham and the Elijah that came earlier which was John the Baptist so let me read to you just a few here now in Isaiah 40:3 it says the voice of him that crith in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord and make straight a desert a highway for our God so now our first word I want you to watch now now the word is prepare Elijah was going to come and prepare and then we find many scriptures that refer to the concept that John came to prepare the way of the Lord because something new was coming then we're going to find other scriptures as I will read them to you in a moment that there word the word there is restore so restore is not getting ready for something new restore is take us back to something that was lost and bring us back to it so the next one then would be in Matthew 31 in those days John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea saying repent ye for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord so now we Isaiah prophesied it and then here's the New Testament testifying John fulfill that he was the preparer Mark tells us the same thing in Mark 1:2 the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord ties it to John John the Baptist and then in Luke 3:4 as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord and we're right back to John the Baptist again and then in John 1:19 here's where it gets a little confusing but let's focus on it just a moment and this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who are you and he confessed and denied not but confessed I am not the Christ so he didn't deny he was anointed but I'm not the Christ you're looking for so that's why he confessed but denied not and they asked him what then are you Elijah and he said says I am not and I'll tell you why in a moment why he said that are you that prophet and of course Moses had spoken in Deuteronomy the Lord your God will raise up a prophet likened unto me he knew what they were asking that was Deuteronomy 18:15 and so he says no I'm not that one so they said who are you and then he quotes Isaiah again that he is that that voice in the wilderness now here we watch the transition scripture it's Malachi 4: five and six behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord catch that now John did not come before the Dreadful day of the Lord we could call it a great day but it wasn't the Dreadful day of the Lord that's going into the tribulation the judgments of God the the day of the Lord is the day of Wrath if you just put quote day of the Lord if you've got a computer and run it through it'll bring up judgment and wrath of God being poured out on Earth then this Elijah now verse six and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and we find in Luke 1:7 that that's ascribed to John the Baptist and then it says and the Heart of the children to their fathers now now here's another group that their heart is going to be turned to the fathers this is not parent child relationships this is the children of God in a certain age are going to be taken that word restore again back to the gospel that Paul preached the apostolic fathers and their their gospel and then in Matthew 17:10 and his disciples asked him saying after they had seen him on the Mount of transfiguration why then say the scribes Elijah must first come and Jesus answered and said to him Elijah truly shall first come and restore all things no noce future tense restore shall restore all things now that's a new word we've seen prepare now it's restore and then the next verse but I say unto you Elijah is come already so John the Baptist with the spirit of Elijah came but now but there is one to come who will restore so before the first coming of the Lord and the second coming of the Lord God uses that same Elijah Spirit to prepare or restore both both ways there's many connotations in invol involved here there's many more that I've got here but just to remind you now of First Corinthians 4:15 for though you have 10,000 instructors Paul says in Christ yet have you not many fathers for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel so that's where we catch the idea that of the apostolic fathers and so in this Elijah Ministry that was to come God would obviously have to do something very very special to call the attention of the people to this ministry and Ed bcll that's here with us in the studio today was an eyewitness to much of this I was not I became aware of this Elijah Ministry just five months after brother brandham passed away though I had heard before but I had no understanding who he was just at very Supernatural Ministry but brother Ed was uh graced privileged to see the see this profit in operation and this ministry in operation and spend personal time uh with him on hunts as well as the more religious things and so brother Ed I'd like to ask you what was the sequence of events because I know you were a very young man when you were first exposed to this ministry what was the sequence of events if you can reach back and tell us that began to lead you to this concept that this was more than a normal anointed Ministry I guess brother Lonnie I would have to start at uh an early age of 14 it was when I was 14 there was a series of meetings that were taking place and of course I had never heard of the name William brandham there uh was a lot of Ministries which were uh r in at that time and uh my father and my mother stopped to take these services in uh it was during those meetings that I saw a blind girl and I was just very close to the front of the auditorium there was about 6 or 8 thousand people there and the man who had introduced William brandham was ER Reverend ER Baxter and he said that this gift had come by a visitation of Angels or an angel of the Lord and that really caught my attention that night I saw that girl right before my eyes healed I saw her eyes straighten out and she was looking straight into the audience at that time brother Lonnie I became aware in my young heart that this Ministry was very different from any other that I had witnessed having grown up in a Christian home then some years later I became a minister I had been ministering about uh 7 years and during that time uh it was a a Revival of restoration which was really spreading throughout the world so the supernatural miracles of all kinds those things were quite in abundance now brother Ed what was the time sequence what date are we talking well we are speaking now from 1948 1958 oh yeah Big Revival time that's a big revival time and there are many names which are familiar today which came on the scene during that time and in fact many of them had their Beginnings really with the ministry of brother brandham he was considering considered an initiator of that great revival can I interrupt you I remember on a radio broadcast that you did you quoted from a book by Edwin Herold which I took the time to uh to get would you mind just reading to the people I've got it marked there for you but because you used it on a broadcast I'd be delighted because uh I I thought that Professor Harold put it in uh such a succinct manner when he said these words incidentally uh he put William brandham and or Roberts as the first two two uh Originators and the two giants of this revival now somebody had to spark the Revival be the torch and he did say that most of the people involved in that Revival in that great move of God which spread all over the Earth most of them considered William brandham as the initiator and he was the torch he was the torch which lit their made their fire Brands uh set of flame and he said this of him Branham seemed an unlikely leader he had long been a pastor in a small Independent Baptist Church he was introduced to the Pentecostal World by the despised oness Pentecostals his preaching was halting and simple beyond belief but William Branham became a prophet to a generation that was the phrase that really struck my heart uh when I read a man who wasn't not necessarily a follower uh of William banmore or any of these Ministries uh but he has described in a very brief few sentences what was happening and I traveled in Evangelistic work in Canada United States I found that there was a great deal of confusion amongst the ministry uh amongst basic things consequently I didn't have a clear understanding of very simple things such as baptism or the godhead and and I had good friends on you know that had various beliefs in that regard but as far as the supernatural was concerned there was a proliferation of that happening at that time now you but you you yourself were ministering in Pentecostal circles in many Pentecostal circles and so you were seeing other Supernatural than that of William brandham correct but yet something made William brandham stand Above the Rest that's what I'm interested in none of them none of them had not only the Declaration that an angel of the Lord which William brandham said right was the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and there was a presence and there were people from all walks of life journalists commentators people who wrote articles and magazines uh they declared that there was a presence a most unusual presence that would come down in those meetings not only that William brandham he did and said things uh that caught the attention of the people and no one else did that for example and I sat in the meetings and he would come to the platform 68 10,000 people and many more in other countries say how do you do friends and he would speak to the people for a few moments and then there' just be a a movement he'd raise his hand and say I take every spirit in this building under my control for the glory of God brother Lonnie it was just like a sacred hush fell over the people it was whether they were critics whether they were uh denominational ministers from all denominations and they sat behind him on the platform there was such a quietness but the thing that really set his ministry aside was the revealing of the secrets of the hearts of the people and even in my young Ministry and those men that I fellowshipped with we readily recognized this was a prophet of God because his ministry he didn't have to come and say he was his Ministry and what he did was a prophetic Ministry at first I must say we were enamored with the fact that it was such glorious it was so accurate it was so perfect we didn't see this in other Ministries we saw great things happening but not with the Precision and the accuracy person after person they would line up brother Lonnie and one person after the other tell them in detail even to their house number and their name over and over again he would some in some cases tell them what their real name was but say they call you this and give them the name that they're known by in the by the family such precision and that is what caught my attention but I would have to say that even all of the supernatural did not answer spiritual questions right and it was not until uh some years later that I had an opportunity to actually meet and be with brother brandham for two weeks and then I had the privilege also of setting up meetings for him we set up four meetings three days each sat on the platform saw people who I knew and I knew that he did not know them he gave the details of their lives of their sickness of their disease and it was just a a marvelous marvelous time but it was my privilege to be able to speak to him then uh concerning some questions which I had in my heart and have those answered by the scriptures okay now hold on hold your thought right there brother Ed I just want to mention something to the to the viewing audience when when a prophet of God can stand and tell you who you are where you're from what your sins were or whether you're healed or not healed it's not to exalt the man William brandham and say oh what a super duper he is that's not the concept the prophet speaks what God puts in his mouth so the concept is God knows your name God knows your address God knows your sickness God knows what you have need of and that would be the primary one of the reasons God would send a prophet and do such a thing to let you know God knows God cares and and it's so it's not to uh exalt the prophet per se it's to make God big and mighty in our in our midst and this ministry for me as surely done that please continue on brother Ed it has done exactly the same for me and I'd like to tell you and tell the listening audience where that had its beginnings and the questions that were so um so much on my heart and so deep on my heart and I had many many Godly friends Minister friends uh that were unable to really answer some very fundamental questions and what was taking place brother Lonnie was I I begin to see a decline I begin to see uh the the supernatural was present but the lives of the people and I'm including ministers was not comparable to the word of God and it troubled me I was very fervent about the scriptures I loved the word and when I would view men's lives and see that they could prophesy or perhaps speak in tongues or exercise gifts but their life did not line up with the word that troubled me very very deeply that was my first question to brother brandham and I asked him I said how can men be anointed I said I know what the anointing is and I can sense that they are anointed how can they be anointed and then their lives not line up with the word of God and brother Lonnie TR to a prophet's Ministry he didn't he didn't try to preach me a sermon he went directly to the scripture immediately and he said have you never read that the rain falls on the just and the unjust and I said yes I certainly have I've read it many times out of Matthew's gospel he asked me what is the rain I said well in the scriptures the rain speaks of the spirit he said exactly and the rain falls on the just and the unjust and I said yes I wasn't catching it yet but he said now the wheat and the tears they grew together in the same field he said brother Eddie you tell me what nurtured the wheat what did the wheat rejoice in and I will tell you what nurtured the tears and they grew so close together that the disciples said should we take up the tears no right don't take up the tears until the end time in the end time the tears and the wheat would manifest now I begin to see that we're growing in the same field enjoying the same the same environment but we're not of the same seed and then he went to a third scripture which was very very powerful for me and he asked for my participation he said when they on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit fell Peter stood up and said that the the spirit of God shall fall upon All Flesh All Flesh but not all flesh is said is saved and when I begin to see that the rain falls and the just and the unjust in the last days sayth God I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and the wheat and the tears are growing in in the same field I I can only tell you that a thousand of my questions were suddenly answered my exact same experience for me when brother Brandon preached that sermon on anointed ones at the end time and the the era of Pentecost I was growing up in they used to have the saying God would never put his holy spirit on an unclean vessel but I was seeing the same thing you were seeing unclean lives but anointed and uh I was just as confused what is this but a prophet's message straightened the whole thing out and and there are two other there are two other examples that I think would be really valuable for the your viewers and that is Judas right which was one of the 12 and he went with the 12 preaching everywhere and they came back rejoicing the great things that had taken place and miracles had taken place and he was right with Jesus carrying the bag right through uh into the communion table at the Last Supper and uh then was manifested MH then Caiaphas the high priest at that time prophesied that one must die for the people the prophecy was correct and he was the high priest he prophesied but he certainly wasn't of the correct s right the correct the scripture says because he was high priest so God used the office even though the man was a rascal yeah how often we see that today exactly yeah and then out of the Old Testament uh the Bible speaks and makes reference to Janice and jambre MH and how they withstood Moses so we can see the Janice and jambre the Judas in the New Testament uh we can see the anointed ones and the anointed ones at the end time the one thing that we have today is a proliferation of those who claim to be anointed and as as brother William brandham said to me they will not say I'm Jesus but they will say I'm anointed and the scripture tells us that in the last days and this to me clenches it many false christs shall arise and they're going to be successful and shall deceive many some are worried about you know a false prophet I I'm not worried about the one I'm worried about the many and when God promised in his word as you had spoken your introduction that God would send uh an Elijah Ministry a prophet with the word of God in his mouth I can say brother Lonnie if there ever was a day when that was needed it was in our time would you mind uh brother Ed elaborating a little bit on Christ because when we say false Christ many people think false Jesus is would you mind expanding on that J a little bit well not a false Jesus but because the there isn't anyone that would want to say I am Jesus or I am I am Jesus Christ but the the term Christ in association with Jesus Christ is that he was the anointed Messiah mhm and then we know that we are anointed MH we become anointed because the the spirit of God does anoint us but uh it when when the people came and Jesus said this many will come to me in that day and say did we not prophesy in your name did we not do many mighty works in your name and Jesus didn't deny that they did he didn't say you did not he said I never knew you mhm and so the the the fact that they uh had done many wonderful Works which they had and they had indeed been anointed but and they could say we are anointed and that is false Christ as Jesus termed it viewers you may recall in the scripture that it says that as Janice and jambes withstood Moses so will these of reprobate mind reprobate concerning the word anointed to power but not anointed to the word so will these in the last days they're going to confuse the whole issue so now again you're catching some of these Mysteries that we've been told you about that are to be revealed at the time of the end and we'll continue on this and it's very good to be with you we thank you so very much for viewing and we're going to come back and continue this subject bye for now to request a copy of today's program on DVD titled an eyewitness or Ed boll's complete testimony also on DVD write
