my mind again oh yeah my brother and god bless you foreign and so we are he's waiting for baptism when and i think we can have two about two seats here for some of you who are out if you can come in [Music] 7. amen but the martin was not able to return he traveled to toronto organic yesterday against the toronto but he's returning now and i know he's streaming the services let us begin with verse 7 and the lord god formed man out of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul mukamaka tunda naboom [Music] and now we shall also read in uh uh we shall also read verses 21. [Music] and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed upon up the flesh instead they arrow mukamaka tunde which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now born of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called a woman she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man you guys say shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked and the man and his wife and we are not ashamed of i've been speaking on the subject that i'm going to speak about today for now to sundays actually three services and uh today will be i think uh a part three of it i wonder how many have come here in the church today to meet the lord jesus christ amen whenever we the children of god go to the house of god the true or hearing how great a preacher is but it's about meeting the lord jesus and jesus is always made through his word little to be able to meet him tomorrow and so i know we have some visitors i mean those who are not necessarily message believers [Music] all right so we have taken genesis i want us to take a moment and look at genesis and they took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh god formed man out of the dust of the ground the lord god formed man i want you to realize here church was actually supposed to be in the image of god above everybody knows financial control because of the way we come in the world we come in the world in a fallen nature and situating by past our true nature what is our true nature or we don't never forget our true nature is the nature of god but we don't never follow truth our true nature is a nature which cannot die by foreign we are not born amen amen why righteous god's you were we now need to find out the twitter as much as all of us are born that way to you not all of us have a seed of god in us even if god himself has to come from heaven and he preaches a powerful summon he cannot move them hey i will give you examples in the bible bible follow me amen i mean so who from the man to who formed man how did he from man out of the dust of the ground yeah attacker so what about this thing of saying that god speaks from nothing he and let me ask you a question this morning what is the image of god yeah come on now what is the image of god yeah spirit on the moon bless you john chapter 4 verse 24. god is a spirit that you worship him in the spirit you he already [Music] and and someone was telling me because he said let us it means it is more than one god how many waters church ghana mexican america how many carriers are maker yes god bless you this woman oh come on come on girl can you say this one like your finger no no the oneness of the water does not mean one like a he can be in me and in you at the same hallelujah amen that is why the trinity is are fostering trinity because they think that each of them is a different god and they thought if you pray to god the father and he refuses you then you can run to god and if the sun defuses then you'll go to the holy spirit for us we serve a living god amen the one god of the bible the one god of israel his name is jesus christ hallelujah and so we notice by the moment god says make man to corrupt our image must finish your faith and what was that man supposed to do oh yeah to be bakers we are created to have dominion right on the word i don't know about you but let me say it this way it was created it could that even the blood that you have in your veins mango messiah what do you mean is your father's blood the blood is from the seed the blood is [Music] when adam was born of rather created adam were at underworld he was a son of god he was an offspring of god and his blood was the blood of god himself he was cutting the dna in the messiah of his father and now cathy adam was like god [Music] so now the bible says i believe so god created the man in his own image in the image of god created him male and female he created them by the spoken word are you following me outside there he spoke yeah and he is what he created and yet to come jesus was a spirit man oh no he was not having a body of flesh and he told him to call and multiply again there immediately pain without suffering and then another time and they would feel their back to zen sick that was the perfect will of god and all of them would be in the image of god furniture those sons of adam would be in the image something happened came oh no [Music] that god has not told you that you can have actual children but when did the suffering come now the serpent came for genesis the ground oh yeah the body it was formed out of the ground this is not the image of god tell your name [Music] why mobility this body and when it was formed then god wow you know he knew that this is just nothing but then what did he do he breathed those of you who have ever bought clothes or you pass around you see he was like and he [Music] she know charity food this body was dead without the breath of god without the spirit of god because remember man was created by the breath of god [Music] me hallelujah amen and some man was formed and then at that moment when man became a living soulmate where [Music] [Applause] in order by the way this man and it is true the devil knew something they did not know he was a spiritual being and when he went to the woman and what is that schedule but the manhattan says that the seed of the serpent is satan could mingle with that with that with a without of the woman yes to bring forth a child never said oh no you're very quiet on me this morning and i know this subject some of you may be new but those of you who know it and you understand it if you hear something you believe say amen and this seed and seekers could mingle yeah yes with the human race and it continues and that is exactly what happened the bible the serpent would now walk on its belly what does it mean it wasn't working it was not a snake it was not a reptile the child it was a beast like you see me never understand you see yourself never worry about having two legs that is how the serpent was oh gosh and it was eating apples from the from the garden because it was [Music] did he go get out what the bible says did god say to your god you shall not eat of every tree foreign guru after he was um thrown out from heaven he came down to the earth and then how he incarnated into the species [Music] to be able to mix up with the human race when saturn was thrown away from the kingdom of god he thought he would come and destabilize the kingdom of man because the kingdom of man let me go to but that was not god's perfection and once you accept it whatever your kid is she received seed enough for an instigator and when she received the scene she became pregnant and then the bible says she went down to her husband now then they were bowed with her navidad and they did it foreign [Music] satan to kill abel that seed line of god he did not foreign adam was not included why why his father was not attacked online [Music] his blood was not silent hallelujah amen and then what did god do he gave eve yawakawa through adam adam another seed of the catch him but cain was not really that's why seth jovan says the bible includes him as the first son of adam bible and he can't it says when in the ground adam was in the image of god yeah much fun but when adam sinned and he came down from the image he was finding god bless you all born in that foreign image of god furniture because the bible says that saith biblica was in the image of god that saith was in the image of god says furniture seth was in the image of adam rather bible gambler says the animated financial adam but adam's image robert financial adam was a following image years later down the road now i say shouldn't our original path was what was not correct us into a ton of troubles we are born with all sorts of mixed feelings we are born with the form of god furniture because we are born in a foreign [Music] why because the seed of god remains in them but yet we were born sinners but why does the bible by say gamblers as the bible says because when we hear the word of god amen amen and that's what it means that you cannot sin hallelujah amen and the serpent seed and single yeah you can never accept the word god came down one day and he spoke to cain imagine who do you think is the greatest pulpit not justified and they preached the summon naval danger and his title was if you do well sing won't you be accepted and his believers were iraqis maybe several sisters and sisters are always more than the brothers my sister is singing and god read you know for me for you you said you were a cattle keeper me i am a gardener but i'm a farmer but since you are a cattle keeper and getting your little dinner in the field and you show me how you're doing and again getting your room down because it seems god is pleased with yourselves [Music] okay [Applause] you may like me or you may hurt me but i'm not representing your life or your health

them and said unto them receive ye the holy ghost whosoever sins he remains they are remitted unto them and so ever since he retained they are retained [Music] the bible tells us i believe that jesus
