[31:47] Joshua of course um sometimes we do
[31:51] minister to the Saints at evening light
[31:54] Tabernacle
[31:59] and this is one of those kind of
[32:03] services and when we do that they
[32:06] broadcast that on their Zoom service and
[32:09] it takes about an
[32:15] hour so uh we shall be one hour in the
[32:19] preaching
[32:21] today okay so I send the greetings to
[32:24] the Saints at evening light bright
[32:28] light bright on Zoom God bless
[32:30] you amen now we go to the Book of Joshua
[32:33] chapter
[32:37] [Music]
[32:48] 24 I'm going to speak on something that
[32:51] is uh the Holy Spirit just uh uh
[32:56] whispered in my ears
[33:02] and it was just a phrase the need of
[33:04] this
[33:09] hour and I may not explain everything on
[33:12] how I received it but we
[33:17] just we just right into
[33:26] it44 now there far fear the lord and
[33:29] serve him in sincerity and in truth and
[33:32] put away the gods which your father
[33:34] served on the other side of the flood
[33:36] and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord
[33:42] [Music]
[34:07] so we are looking at a
[34:10] time when Israel uh possessed had
[34:14] already promised possessed the promised
[34:18] land and by this time most of the
[34:21] battles they had already
[34:25] fought and they had already tested on
[34:27] the full F Promises of
[34:31] God they had left the Wilderness behind
[34:35] them they had left the Red Sea behind
[34:38] them they had possessed Jericho and
[34:41] other
[34:42] cities you know they had fought against
[34:44] many
[34:45] people and they had won most of these
[34:48] batt they had fought with the
[34:51] amorites with the parites with the
[34:54] canites with the Hees with the hites
[34:58] jeites with the gages and many other
[35:02] groups and you know when you read very
[35:05] well when you read the chapter 24 of
[35:08] Joshua God kept on reminding
[35:11] them how many battles he won for
[35:15] them so in other words God kept on
[35:18] reminding
[35:19] Israel that none of those battles you
[35:23] won because of your own making
[35:27] it is I that made you
[35:29] win it is I that brought the victory to
[35:33] you he had even told them that you you
[35:36] never build
[35:38] cities but I gave you cities you know
[35:42] God has a way of doing his own
[35:45] things but when it comes to
[35:48] Israel he promised them a land flowing
[35:50] with milk and
[35:53] honey you see at the time that he the
[35:56] promise was given
[35:58] there were already other people in that
[36:01] land and those people were already
[36:04] building those people were already
[36:06] owning these things they were making it
[36:09] greater and
[36:10] greater but God came down to somebody
[36:13] and he promis
[36:15] them he said I'll give you all
[36:18] that I'll give you everything in
[36:20] it praise the name of the Lord did you
[36:24] know that God has a way of taking the
[36:26] wealth of the UN
[36:30] and giving it to the
[36:32] faithful so in other words it behoves us
[36:35] as
[36:36] Christian to really be faithful to
[36:40] really be
[36:41] sincere you know there is a need in
[36:45] this and this is what I want to speak on
[36:48] the need of this
[36:51] house all the Jews that were not
[36:55] sincere God never allowed them to cross
[36:59] over God never allowed them to test of
[37:01] the good of the
[37:03] land but now we see those that who were
[37:07] sincere they got to this land but after
[37:11] they had you know after God had warn for
[37:13] them all the
[37:15] victories after they had overcome the
[37:18] Wilderness after they had crossed the
[37:20] Red Sea and they had possessed all the
[37:24] cities they now slowly
[37:28] started to leave their
[37:32] sincerity they started to walk away from
[37:35] truth in their service to the
[37:38] Lord there is something I do not know
[37:40] whether you will call it a preaching or
[37:41] an Evangelistic sermon or a pastor
[37:43] someone but something that God has laid
[37:45] on my heart to share with you this
[37:53] evening there is a need of this
[37:58] the Christians of
[37:59] today you the ones that profess
[38:03] Christ there is a great need of
[38:07] this amen and these people you know how
[38:11] they God had been there for
[38:14] them God had been faithful with
[38:17] them God had taken them through
[38:20] everything but at the end of it all they
[38:24] started thinking it was their strength
[38:27] it was their wisdom it was their power
[38:31] it was their Art of
[38:33] War and so God now through
[38:36] Joshua he comes to them and he says fear
[38:39] the
[38:40] lord and I'm speaking to you tonight
[38:42] fear the
[38:43] lord and he told them serve him in
[38:48] sincerity and I tell you tonight serve
[38:50] him in
[38:52] sinity we have a lot of people that are
[38:55] serving God
[38:57] Amen in the message
[38:59] churches amen especially our younger
[39:02] generation but we have very few who are
[39:05] serving him in
[39:07] sincerity we have very few singers who
[39:10] are
[39:11] sincere we have very few musicians who
[39:13] are
[39:14] sincere we have very few preachers who
[39:16] are
[39:17] sincere we have very few believers who
[39:20] are
[39:21] sincere but yet they claim to believe
[39:23] the message
[39:25] of if there is something that God really
[39:30] respects if there is something that
[39:32] really God
[39:33] loves it is one and it is called
[39:36] [Music]
[39:37] sincerity and today we are going to
[39:38] speak about it as the need of
[39:43] this amen many Believers after God
[39:45] delivers and justifies
[39:49] them when all enemies are now under
[39:52] their
[39:53] feet now they say we now know the
[39:56] message
[39:57] we have now left our
[39:59] denominations we now have received the
[40:01] prophet of the
[40:03] hour we now know the message of the
[40:06] hour we now have all the books we have
[40:10] all the T you know we now have a good
[40:12] church we have a good pastor you know
[40:16] people have reached a
[40:18] place where now they are no longer
[40:22] sincere they are in a place where they
[40:25] are believers by name
[40:29] actually now you will ask many people
[40:30] who is going to the
[40:33] Rapture and they will tell you Believers
[40:36] of the
[40:37] message but I ask you the same question
[40:40] tonight who is going in the
[40:42] Rapture who is going in the
[40:46] Rapture who is going in the
[40:48] Rapture I do not want amen I want to
[40:50] hear your answer who is going in the
[40:54] [Music]
[40:55] Rapture did you no it has come to a
[40:59] place where Believers don't actually
[41:01] know who is going the
[41:04] rupture many of you were almost telling
[41:06] me
[41:09] you or maybe you were thinking of
[41:11] someone
[41:13] perf now let me tell you you must have
[41:17] an answer whether or not you are going
[41:20] to as a matter of
[41:23] fact it must be
[41:25] you you an
[41:28] individual you must make your calling an
[41:30] election
[41:32] sh that hour was to come
[41:36] now are you ready if you are not then
[41:40] you not
[41:42] sincere because if you are a believer of
[41:44] the message which is supposed to prepare
[41:47] you for the coming of the
[41:49] Lord then the question is are you sure
[41:52] you are
[41:53] going if you're not sure you are
[41:56] going not a sincere
[41:59] [Music]
[42:00] believer we have all the message we have
[42:04] all the tapes we have good preachers we
[42:06] good churches that's all good amen the
[42:10] need of
[42:11] this amen sincity before
[42:15] God is serving God with
[42:19] sincity he serving God with
[42:22] truth preachers are not the only
[42:25] servants brother if you would give me
[42:27] more sound he preach not the only
[42:31] servants
[42:32] no everyone is a
[42:34] servant you serve God by the way you
[42:38] believe you serve God by the way you you
[42:41] you live your
[42:44] life and many Believers now have come to
[42:46] a
[42:48] place where they feel
[42:50] delivered when they F
[42:53] justify when all enemies are now under
[42:55] their feet
[42:57] and they they become
[42:59] blessed they and they become
[43:02] increased and when they become
[43:05] richer in material
[43:08] wealth they start to lower the
[43:12] bar they start to become
[43:15] insincere in their service to
[43:19] God many people have not seen them when
[43:22] they going through a terrible time in
[43:24] their
[43:26] life pray so much they seek after God
[43:30] they sincere before God and when you
[43:32] know they attain what they were praying
[43:34] for then they are no longer where they
[43:37] used to
[43:39] be I believe we do not find a time to
[43:42] pray because we are
[43:43] [Music]
[43:48] needy we should not make
[43:50] prayer as a matter of
[43:55] begging we don't pray because we are
[43:59] miserable we don't pray because we you
[44:02] know we need so much from
[44:05] God he has given us everything we
[44:08] need amen by his word we have everything
[44:11] we
[44:12] need why then should we
[44:15] pray we pray even to have a relationship
[44:18] with
[44:19] him amen we go before him amen as a
[44:23] habit amen of developing and building
[44:26] our relationship with
[44:29] him because he came down from
[44:32] heaven so that he can purchase us and
[44:36] therefore we belong to
[44:38] him our souls are his but he wants to
[44:42] have fellowship with
[44:44] us and our prayer must always be an act
[44:47] of
[44:50] Fellowship not an act of
[44:53] asking and so I ask then what is
[44:55] sincerity
[44:58] and I I was reading something and it
[45:00] really moved me said
[45:03] sincerity is the
[45:05] quality of being free from
[45:13] pretense
[45:16] deceit is a quality of being free from
[45:22] pretense free from
[45:24] deceit free from hypocrisy
[45:29] if you heard it say
[45:30] Amen sincere people represent
[45:35] themselves they represent themselves
[45:41] honestly they represent themselves in
[45:43] their verbal
[45:45] Expressions you know
[45:48] honestly in their verbal Expressions
[45:50] they are free from double
[45:55] talk all right say something here say
[45:58] something else
[46:01] here you know in their ver Expressions
[46:03] they have no
[46:06] gossip they are free from double
[46:09] talk they are free from
[46:12] Gossip they are also free from
[46:16] [Music]
[46:17] flattery and all
[46:21] embellishment decoration you know
[46:23] decorating
[46:29] you know you met many times meet people
[46:31] who you know can really talk so well
[46:34] about
[46:36] you and you know speak everything good
[46:39] about you know big
[46:41] words you know because they want
[46:44] something from
[46:48] you not because they're
[46:50] sincere so usually sincere people in
[46:55] their expressions
[46:57] you never find them you know
[47:00] flattering
[47:01] flattering is not flattery is
[47:10] like you find that's why you find many
[47:13] marriages in
[47:15] trouble but when you go in
[47:19] public especially if that man knows that
[47:21] he was having a problem with his wife at
[47:25] home when he gets a has to have a
[47:28] microphone that's when he will really
[47:30] flatter
[47:32] her oh she's the best of the best oh
[47:35] she's been with me she's
[47:38] powerful bam said if you really want to
[47:40] know if a man is Born
[47:44] Again ask his
[47:47] wife because his wife knows the real
[47:50] true character of this
[47:55] man did you say Amen to that
[48:00] sisters your your expression will be
[48:02] free of
[48:04] Gossip free of
[48:06] flattery free of double talk you will be
[48:10] honest you will not be having
[48:14] hypocrisy you know you'll be free from
[48:19] pretense free from
[48:22] deceit you will not be a
[48:24] hypocrite you will set the truth
[48:27] truth and the Bible places a high value
[48:30] on
[48:34] sincerity praise the name of the
[48:37] Lord
[48:39] sincerity cannot be
[48:43] overemphasized the need of
[48:45] this is more
[48:49] sincerity if Believers can be more
[48:53] sincere let me tell you we will have
[48:55] blessings beyond measure
[48:59] our churches will grow and grow and
[49:01] grow and no man can limit it or stop
[49:06] it you know Christians and Believers
[49:08] would grow
[49:10] spiritually you would overcome many
[49:14] things you
[49:16] know many Roman
[49:19] Catholics more sincere than believers
[49:29] Pastor what are you talking
[49:31] about a Roman Catholic will come before
[49:33] a
[49:35] priest Tell Him Father I have
[49:39] SE what have you done my daughter I've
[49:42] killed
[49:47] someone Roman Catholic will do
[49:50] that you tell him I have committed
[49:54] a father pray for me
[49:58] and you know the Reverend father will
[50:00] ask
[50:01] questions and you can be 100%
[50:04] sure that all those answers are going to
[50:07] be 100%
[50:10] correct because these people are
[50:14] sincere but talked about being
[50:19] sincere and being
[50:23] wrong these people are sincere but they
[50:25] are wrong in their
[50:29] ology so they sincerely
[50:33] wrong we the Believers of this
[50:37] message oh Hallelujah hallu we have the
[50:40] truth we have the absolute
[50:43] truth this let me tell you this message
[50:46] we believe is is not just one
[50:49] God it's not just baptism in Jesus name
[50:53] it is more than just Holiness it's more
[50:55] than rules of do
[50:57] and this message is really the
[51:00] truth this message is the
[51:03] way you cannot go to the Rapture in this
[51:07] generation if you have not received this
[51:09] message of the
[51:10] hour how many believe that and
[51:13] can this message is the way in this
[51:16] generation for the children of Goden to
[51:20] be able to be
[51:21] raptured and let me tell you if only we
[51:24] can be
[51:25] sincere we shall be sincerely
[51:29] right Hallelujah but many hold the
[51:34] truth
[51:38] insincerity stay in
[51:41] church they know that they need
[51:43] help they know they need to overcome
[51:45] certain
[51:47] things but they cannot seek for
[51:49] help they can even ask anyone to pray
[51:52] for
[51:53] them they cannot even go to the pastor
[51:55] for help
[51:57] they can go the deons for help because
[52:00] maybe they fear the deacons or maybe
[52:02] they fear the pastor maybe they think
[52:05] when I go for help then maybe they will
[52:06] embarrass me or tell somebody else about
[52:09] what I have
[52:13] done so you be you decide to become
[52:17] insincere because you fear the Deon may
[52:20] be
[52:22] insincere maybe the pastor may be
[52:24] insincere
[52:26] maybe the brother may be
[52:28] insincere imagine if each of us was
[52:31] really dead
[52:35] sincere the devil would not have a place
[52:38] Among
[52:39] Us the devil would not have a
[52:42] place and that's why I'm saying
[52:45] sincerity is the need of this
[52:48] house if we were more sincere you would
[52:51] have less and less battles between
[52:53] Ministries and ministers
[52:58] because we have a calling to bring light
[53:01] to the world where Darkness has
[53:06] filled the Bible says gross
[53:09] Darkness has covered the
[53:11] people gross Darkness has covered the
[53:15] Earth so where is the light but a
[53:18] prophet came and preached a
[53:20] sermon and he said there is a man
[53:23] here who can turn on the light
[53:26] what is this message this is is the
[53:30] light are shown in the
[53:32] darkness but people are not
[53:35] sincere having received this
[53:37] light you know if you were
[53:40] sincere you know you would have a good
[53:43] motive if you are sincere you have a
[53:46] good
[53:47] objective you never do anything to hurt
[53:49] your
[53:51] brother you never do anything to Hur
[53:53] your
[53:54] sister your objective will be
[53:57] One how can I help them how can I help
[54:00] them come closer to
[54:02] God how can I help them they overcome
[54:06] what they fighting but what do we have
[54:09] we have people who are not
[54:12] sincere God help us
[54:17] friends when the angel of the Lord came
[54:20] to our
[54:22] Prophet William Bram William Bram do you
[54:25] know the thing he told
[54:28] he told him how he had been
[54:31] commissioned how he was born for a
[54:33] purpose how he would take a gift of
[54:36] Divine
[54:37] Healing to the people of the
[54:39] world how no demon would stand before
[54:43] him how he would heal the
[54:45] sick Open the Eyes of the Blind and God
[54:49] would use him
[54:50] powerful but that
[54:52] commission even though it was
[54:54] predestinated
[54:57] it was based on one
[54:59] thing
[55:01] sincerity so if he did not become
[55:05] sincere those things will not have
[55:09] happen there are many potential that you
[55:13] have but if you're not
[55:16] sincere with
[55:18] God you will live in a life of untapped
[55:22] resources
[55:24] [Music]
[55:29] brother bam said in a message the angel
[55:31] of
[55:33] God a supernatural being come walking
[55:36] into the
[55:38] room an angel said he would he was sent
[55:42] from the presence of
[55:44] God he said if you get the people to
[55:47] believe
[55:49] you if you would be
[55:52] sincere when you
[55:54] pray not nothing shall stand before
[55:59] you nothing shall stand before
[56:03] your not even
[56:05] cancer but why do things stand before
[56:08] our
[56:10] prayer why do you have many unanswered
[56:14] prayers let me give you an answer you
[56:17] are not
[56:18] sincere enough before
[56:22] God there I will give you two instances
[56:25] of sincerity in brother Bam's
[56:30] Ministry things that you would call
[56:32] maybe the small
[56:34] things one time he had tax
[56:38] issues where he was asked by the you
[56:41] know by the tax people to pay a lot of
[56:45] money and he didn't have the
[56:48] money and so um when the tax man
[56:54] called he was in the house with his
[56:57] wife he no her they're
[57:00] calling brother samel he told his
[57:04] wife pick that
[57:06] call and tell them I'm not in and he
[57:11] went
[57:13] out was he
[57:18] in would you may say yes or
[57:21] no but the fact was he was not in the
[57:25] house
[57:31] but the truth
[57:32] is he was telling a lie because he was
[57:40] around so it depends on your level of
[57:45] sincerity on what you will think was he
[57:48] right or he was
[57:50] wrong was he in or he was out
[57:56] he was out
[57:58] yes but sincerely he was
[58:03] in and the wife
[58:05] said I'm sorry
[58:07] butam is not
[58:09] in is not in or whatever she
[58:12] said I said okay we'll call
[58:15] later and then he came back
[58:19] in and later on shortly
[58:23] after there came a mother
[58:26] with a dying
[58:28] child and he is a prophet of
[58:31] God with an anointing of God with a
[58:35] commission to pray for the sick and
[58:39] nothing would stand before
[58:42] his that was from
[58:45] God but remember there was a
[58:48] condition he would be
[58:52] sincere so when he came to pray for the
[58:54] child
[58:56] the spirit of God told
[58:59] him you cannot pray for the
[59:01] child you are a
[59:05] liar a
[59:08] liar a liar I lied he was condemned he
[59:14] was convicted
[59:16] I'm he did not go to return the
[59:20] call he took his car and drove many
[59:25] miles
[59:26] to the office of this
[59:29] man and he looked him in the
[59:31] eyes said
[59:33] sir I know you've you've trusted me all
[59:36] these
[59:37] years and you know me to be a
[59:40] faithful but I'm here to make something
[59:44] right what is it
[59:46] Mr rever Bram what is
[59:49] happening I know you you one of the
[59:51] finest I've
[59:54] seen he said
[59:57] and the man looked at him and he said Mr
[1:00:01] Bram I've trusted you all these
[1:00:04] years but what you have done
[1:00:07] today has made me have more confidence
[1:00:09] in
[1:00:13] you what is
[1:00:15] that brother bam was deadly
[1:00:20] sincere everything he did he was
[1:00:24] sincere and then he went went
[1:00:26] back and the child the mother the child
[1:00:29] was
[1:00:30] waiting and he prayed for the child and
[1:00:33] the child was
[1:00:35] he praise God he was
[1:00:38] sincere and that's why God would use him
[1:00:40] in the magnitude he
[1:00:44] used in and many places when he would be
[1:00:47] asked a
[1:00:49] question and if he didn't know he would
[1:00:51] say I do not know
[1:00:56] was
[1:00:58] sincerity he was a good
[1:01:01] example but many
[1:01:04] Believers we've lowered the
[1:01:07] bars we are not as sincere as we are
[1:01:10] supposed to
[1:01:15] be and and I'll quote you something here
[1:01:17] from the message the prophet elishah
[1:01:28] and
[1:01:28] brother that's the matter with the
[1:01:30] church
[1:01:33] today the reason we don't see
[1:01:36] Visions how many believe in seeing
[1:01:40] visions how many believe in
[1:01:44] tongues how many believe in
[1:01:45] interpretation of
[1:01:48] T I take it that those who are not
[1:01:50] lifting up their hands they don't
[1:01:51] believe in
[1:01:53] it but I'll tell you here we believe it
[1:01:57] we believe in Visions we believe in
[1:01:59] spiritual Dre we believe in speaking in
[1:02:01] Tong we believe in interpretation of
[1:02:03] Tong we believe in prophetic
[1:02:06] utterances we believe in the
[1:02:08] Supernatural we believe in Divine
[1:02:11] Healing can I hear the believer say Amen
[1:02:14] we sure believe those things and we have
[1:02:17] seen many of those in our little
[1:02:19] assembly
[1:02:20] here and he says the reason we don't see
[1:02:24] Visions have just a little narrow-minded
[1:02:29] thought is because we don't pray long
[1:02:33] enough we don't do something long enough
[1:02:36] until the spirit of God comes into our
[1:02:42] M we don't T in his in his
[1:02:46] presence we are never
[1:02:48] sincere we are in the house of God but
[1:02:52] our heart is somewhere else we are in
[1:02:54] the house of God but we are asking
[1:02:56] ourselves when the singing will
[1:02:59] stop people are not sincere
[1:03:02] enough desire to go in his
[1:03:05] presence to open their
[1:03:08] hearts and in truth to say oh God I want
[1:03:12] you to come and per through
[1:03:15] my come and burn all the DRS
[1:03:18] away spirit of
[1:03:21] God people are not sincere enough he
[1:03:25] says we use to sing the oldfashioned
[1:03:29] songs till tears run down their
[1:03:33] cheeks and seen as God
[1:03:37] say even before the preacher got to the
[1:03:41] platform people are already crying
[1:03:44] people already falling down people
[1:03:46] already shouting why because of
[1:03:49] singing but why doesn't singing move
[1:03:52] them anymore
[1:03:56] because people are no longer
[1:03:59] sincere why do we have drye
[1:04:03] prayers because people are no longer
[1:04:06] sincere why can't we sing until we are
[1:04:10] moved by the
[1:04:12] power because we are no longer
[1:04:15] sincere why do we sit and hear the word
[1:04:19] and the word doesn't move our spirit and
[1:04:21] our
[1:04:22] soul because we are not sincere
[1:04:26] we lack
[1:04:28] sincerity that's the problem of the Lan
[1:04:32] church and that's why when the angel of
[1:04:34] the Lord came
[1:04:35] down he told the prophet of God you must
[1:04:39] be
[1:04:41] sincere but
[1:04:43] today he says we have just the old
[1:04:50] ritual we have the cut and dried program
[1:04:57] you know we have to sing one song and
[1:04:59] give offerings and and you know sing
[1:05:02] another song invite one special song
[1:05:06] invite the preacher you know program is
[1:05:10] good but let me tell you we believe in
[1:05:13] church
[1:05:14] order how many can say Amen to that we
[1:05:18] believe in church
[1:05:19] order but we don't believe in closing
[1:05:23] the Holy Spirit out
[1:05:27] amen that's why even sometimes I've
[1:05:29] noticed
[1:05:31] here that the song leer may
[1:05:33] say everybody sing one
[1:05:36] song don't sing another song after
[1:05:40] that and then another person comes up
[1:05:43] and maybe sings a worship song and
[1:05:45] people go in
[1:05:47] prayer let me tell you now let me guide
[1:05:50] you whenever that thing happen songer
[1:05:54] whoever it is you are
[1:05:56] on the
[1:05:57] congregation please let the Holy Spirit
[1:06:01] move when you notice that God is
[1:06:05] moving it may take our time it may be
[1:06:09] out of our program but if it is God
[1:06:12] moving let God move because we believe
[1:06:15] in
[1:06:17] sincerity and if we are in sincere if we
[1:06:19] are sincere enough in our
[1:06:22] hearts we will desire to be carried into
[1:06:24] his presence
[1:06:28] program cannot
[1:06:29] replace the program of the Holy
[1:06:33] Spirit we got to go through this that we
[1:06:37] say and the other I'm afraid we are
[1:06:40] grieving the spirit of God away from
[1:06:44] us don't you think so he says and he
[1:06:48] says I remember the old nights of the
[1:06:52] methodists or reading of it
[1:06:57] when they first come here meaning in
[1:07:00] America as and johnley and
[1:07:04] them when they were called holy
[1:07:08] lawers themselves and he says now you
[1:07:10] Methodist in these fine big churches
[1:07:12] don't want to believe
[1:07:16] that but they were holy
[1:07:20] lawers why did they now listen why did
[1:07:23] they call them holy la
[1:07:26] is because when they would
[1:07:28] sing they begin to sing they begin to
[1:07:31] praise God they begin to hear the word
[1:07:34] power of God would
[1:07:36] come and you find women old women
[1:07:41] young just falling down rolling and
[1:07:47] crying do we still believe those kind of
[1:07:50] things or is it strange Among
[1:07:53] Us is it out of order
[1:08:00] and your pastor your founder joh wi was
[1:08:03] a great believer in Divine Healing

[1:08:23] own notebook I have it

[1:08:31] and the horse fell and broke his
[1:08:33] leg he couldn't get the horse
[1:08:36] up and he seen the horse's leg was
[1:08:40] broke he took the cruise of oil from his
[1:08:44] pocket he anointed the horse in the
[1:08:48] oil jumped on his
[1:08:51] horse and rode
[1:08:53] away preach that in the me this church

[1:20:10] we came to the message it does not mean
[1:20:12] Revival has
[1:20:14] done come into the message of the hour
[1:20:18] it only means Revival has

[1:21:09] demons how much more we that have a real
[1:21:13] truth the real word let me tell you we
[1:21:18] have the real word thereby when we
[1:21:21] believe it it has real power
[1:21:24] to cause real
[1:21:27] impact it is a sin for you to believe
[1:21:31] the message and Rel defeated
[1:21:40] life and that is the sin which cannot be
[1:21:44] forgiven because you
[1:21:47] blaspheming you are saying the word has
[1:21:50] no
[1:21:51] power but let me tell you I will take it
[1:21:54] defense for the word the word of God has
[1:21:58] power power to change power to deliver
[1:22:02] to heal Hallelujah the only thing we
[1:22:06] need in this
[1:22:07] house is more
[1:22:12] sincerity because the Bible speaks about
[1:22:14] the condition
[1:22:16] of in Revelation
[1:22:19] 3:15 I Know Thy works that you are
[1:22:22] neither cold or hot
[1:22:25] I would thou
[1:22:27] C so then because
[1:22:30] thou and neither cold nor I'll spew the
[1:22:33] out of my
[1:22:34] mouth because thou sayest I am rich and
[1:22:38] increased with
[1:22:39] good and I have need of nothing and
[1:22:42] knowest not that thou
[1:22:45] Ed miserable poor blind
[1:22:50] naked this is the situation the
[1:22:53] condition of
[1:22:54] they're like the Jews or
[1:22:56] Israelites when they cross over to the
[1:22:58] promised
[1:23:00] land they like
[1:23:02] now we have need of nothing yes I know
[1:23:05] that this is speaking of
[1:23:08] theia and the bride is
[1:23:11] not
[1:23:13] but has come in
[1:23:16] church and you find many believers
[1:23:19] who where they think they need
[1:23:22] nothing they know all the message
[1:23:25] they know the Bible they can quot the
[1:23:27] scriptures
[1:23:28] offhe they can even the message offhe
[1:23:32] they they know it all you are knowing
[1:23:36] everything won't make make you
[1:23:39] anything I told you if knowledge will
[1:23:42] make anybody
[1:23:46] anything iPads laptops
[1:23:52] and they know everything
[1:23:54] your knowledge is
[1:23:57] nothing but your sincity is
[1:24:00] everything because your
[1:24:02] sincity will open a channel where the
[1:24:06] power of God will be
[1:24:10] Limitless your sincity will open a
[1:24:13] channel for God to use you
[1:24:16] power your sincity will open a channel
[1:24:20] where you will
[1:24:21] function Amen in a in a in a
[1:24:25] level where you will not be
[1:24:29] defeated was told if you are sincere if
[1:24:33] you are
[1:24:33] sincere nothing will stand before your
[1:24:37] prayer not even
[1:24:40] cancer not even HIV not even any
[1:24:44] disease
[1:24:45] sincerity we need
[1:24:48] sincerity would go among
[1:24:51] Believers and he would call one two
[1:24:53] three people
[1:24:55] 4 five and even
[1:24:58] then people they would still be
[1:25:03] hard-hearted and he would call
[1:25:06] others and he would call
[1:25:08] somebody he would do a
[1:25:13] prayer but he would go among
[1:25:17] unbeliever he would just call one two
[1:25:20] people design their
[1:25:22] situation and he would say it is now
[1:25:24] milky
[1:25:28] everywhere and say now
[1:25:30] everyone that is sick receive your
[1:25:33] healing you say those in the whe stand
[1:25:37] up it wasn't him it was the people
[1:25:42] sincerity that was driving the
[1:25:46] gift the people
[1:25:48] sincity and the prophet is
[1:25:52] sincerity if you are sincere
[1:25:55] we can go to deeper Heights of the
[1:25:58] spirit let me tell what God has done for
[1:26:01] you that is just the
[1:26:03] beginning that is just the beginning if
[1:26:06] you can be more
[1:26:08] sincere wait and see what God will do
[1:26:12] you there is much more but they people I
[1:26:17] look neither cold or
[1:26:20] H the age where Christians are not
[1:26:22] straight
[1:26:25] they
[1:26:27] confus they are not on fire for
[1:26:29] God but also they not outright
[1:26:35] Sinners look
[1:26:37] condition the need of
[1:26:40] this be more sincere in everything we
[1:26:44] do be more sincere

[1:27:11] 129 love must be
[1:27:16] sincere love say let love verse let love
[1:27:20] be without dissimilation
[1:27:25] what is
[1:27:27] dissimilation it means concealment of
[1:27:30] one's
[1:27:32] thoughts feelings of character so in
[1:27:37] other words someone can say they love
[1:27:39] you but they conceal their real
[1:27:44] thoughts they conceal their
[1:27:46] feelings they conce their
[1:27:49] character they are
[1:27:53] pretending that is not love but the
[1:27:56] Bible says love must be
[1:28:00] sincere raise
[1:28:03] god without
[1:28:06] misrepresentation without
[1:28:08] deceit without

[1:29:30] sincere that is
[1:29:32] genuine
[1:29:34] authentic so if you feel
[1:29:36] tonight you've been faking You' been you
[1:29:41] know you've been
[1:29:42] faking you're like I don't feel likeing
[1:29:48] today but let me
[1:29:51] try I saw something and I felt so bad
[1:29:56] it was posted by one of the young
[1:30:00] people who claims to be a believer of
[1:30:02] this
[1:30:03] message I said oh
[1:30:05] God save us unto this outward
[1:30:10] generation and this person put this on
[1:30:13] their
[1:30:14] status this should not even be anywhere
[1:30:17] among a
[1:30:18] Believers and the reason why I'm
[1:30:20] bringing it on the
[1:30:21] poit because these spirits jump from one
[1:30:25] to
[1:30:26] another and we all to rebuke them from
[1:30:28] the
[1:30:31] ppose and this this
[1:30:34] sister they said sister put this up on
[1:30:37] her on our
[1:30:39] status and just some people you know
[1:30:43] scoffing or scoffing against church
[1:30:47] people but the fact that she presented
[1:30:49] it
[1:30:51] there it means she believed in it
[1:30:54] and if she believes in it it means there
[1:30:57] are many more and that's why I need to
[1:30:59] talk about it and you find that she put
[1:31:02] this up that you know this is how people
[1:31:05] be in
[1:31:07] church worshiping
[1:31:10] God how great is our God but in reality
[1:31:15] and then they put some other
[1:31:17] things dancers of the
[1:31:20] club that in reality that's how they
[1:31:23] want to dance
