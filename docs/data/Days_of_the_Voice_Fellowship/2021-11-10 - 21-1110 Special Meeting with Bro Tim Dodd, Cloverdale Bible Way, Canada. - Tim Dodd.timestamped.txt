[15:25] [Music]
[15:42] [Music]
[15:44] is
[15:46] [Music]
[15:55] well i i want to just say just before we

[15:58] bus
[15:59] church
[16:05] we've been connected for
[16:19] [Music]
[16:32] if we surrender to the lord
[17:02] just
[17:48] [Music]
[18:12] to every hero
[18:18] [Music]
[18:27] psalms 1 and verse 1 says blessed is the
[18:29] man that walketh not in the counsel of
[18:31] the ungodly nor sitted
[18:34] nor standings i'm sorry in the way of
[18:37] sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the
[18:39] scornful
[19:03] but his delight is in the law of the
[19:05] lord and in his law does he meditate day
[19:09] and night
[19:16] [Music]
[19:18] and he shall be like a tree planted by
[19:20] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[19:22] his fruit in his season
[19:25] his leaf off also shall not wither and
[19:28] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[19:42] [Music]
[20:00] there's a kind of a funny question that
[20:02] says if you were a tree what kind of a
[20:04] tree would you be
[20:10] and if i was a tree i'd want to be a
[20:12] tree planted by the rivers of water

[36:48] [Music]
[37:15] if you're not planted in the right place

[41:24] government away from the word of god
[41:34] began to lose visions
[41:39] [Music]
[41:56] but he didn't stay in the world
[42:11] the bible says he's landed like behind

[42:21] where does the river come from
[42:32] it comes from the mountains
[42:35] [Music]
[42:37] it starts from rain
[42:40] the rain comes in the mountains
[42:56] that river
[43:09] blessings to israel

[44:32] blessings of god
[44:48] god
[44:50] [Music]
[45:14] god
[45:16] [Music]

[45:40] when god sends his anointing to the
[45:42] world
[45:46] [Music]
[46:01] [Music]
[46:08] [Applause]
[46:12] ain't nobody

[47:40] [Music]
[47:47] [Music]
[48:01] [Music]
[48:12] [Applause]

[50:50] your body
[51:05] [Applause]
[51:09] the holy spirit
[51:12] [Music]
[51:33] it's always been the same
[51:47] so there's blessings on
[51:56] anointing to preach is different than
[51:58] the anointing to prayer
[52:06] so
[52:07] there's anointings to individuals you
[52:09] know there's blessings that we look

[57:37] here
[57:39] [Music]
[58:31] what was happening
[58:47] when god does something
[59:09] [Applause]
[59:22] [Music]
