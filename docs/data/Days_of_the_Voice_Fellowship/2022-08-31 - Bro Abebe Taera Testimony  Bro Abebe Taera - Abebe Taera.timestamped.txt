[20:46] in the message
[20:49] um
[20:51] the works that i do bear witness of me
[20:59] prophet says
[21:13] it would be a better evidence that you
[21:15] are a christian
[21:20] tonight
[21:28] um
[21:30] [Music]
[21:51] and if we say we have faith and then
[21:53] afraid to step out and claim our faith
[21:55] and put it to work then our face doesn't
[21:58] do us as much good hey
[22:04] guys
[22:11] the bible said that faith without works
[22:14] is dead just as the body without the
[22:16] spirit is dead
[22:22] so is faith works
[22:28] he says you know a living someone is
[22:30] better than one being preached
[22:38] um
[22:53] amen mean
[22:55] it's good to preach
[22:58] inspires
[23:01] he takes us on another level
[23:05] jesus
[23:06] christ emmanuel priest but the prophet
[23:09] says the better someone is the one that
[23:11] is lived
[23:18] and i remember that we spent
[23:21] about
[23:23] actually more than four years
[23:25] uh without leaving in ethiopia with my
[23:28] family
[23:31] and i'm ethiopia we did not get too far
[23:34] we we went okay when we went there we
[23:37] first we were going we thought we were
[23:38] going to leave for six months we tried
[23:40] to work again
[23:43] but then it ended up being years
[23:47] and out of that
[24:03] he said i would chat to you and we were
[24:04] going to return
[24:07] some brothers put me on the side and say
[24:12] you thought we believe the message
[24:16] because
[24:17] you preach
[24:20] that
[24:22] specifically brother mentioned this
[24:26] here who is now the pastor of the church
[24:57] you did not just preach the things but
[24:58] you lived it
[25:02] and it that impacted our life
[25:26] praise
[25:39] m
[26:08] mean
[26:10] and so
[26:11] tonight
[26:12] what do you do
[26:14] we
[26:15] we have somebody who has a testimony
[26:17] today no moon to arena of judaism i live
[26:20] the life of them what ambulate
[26:32] [Music]
[26:37] can preach it singular
[26:39] remember look how much you can shout
[26:41] yourself
[26:42] not how much you can dance
[26:45] but what you have lived
[26:48] over time
[26:49] that's the best summon you can ever
[26:51] preach my sister are you engineer
[26:54] rather than the best someone you can
[26:57] enjoy
[26:59] and the prophet says
[27:01] don't be afraid of your testimony
[27:05] for jesus christ
[27:07] amen mean shed forth your life
[27:13] stand for your convictions
[27:17] that he is the

[1:12:49] bury you
[1:12:51] and they are the only body
[1:12:54] usually at the churches
[1:12:58] and of course there is no message there

[1:13:30] it calls god down
[1:13:35] and we they they they read us they said
[1:13:37] let's go
[1:13:40] and we traveled and walked and walked
[1:13:41] and walked to find the water
[1:13:45] and uh we reached a place to come well

[1:14:48] amen
[1:14:49] and uh and uh god has continued to prove
[1:14:53] himself to be a living god
[1:15:05] [Applause]
