all welcome in the name of Jesus Christ to your neighbor tell them welcome to the house we are turning to the Book of Genesis chapter 6 5 thank you musicians God bless you Genesis chapter 6 I think I'll need more sound in this monitor brother brother shim vers 5 to8 are we all there uh I see some people without Bibles and I believe that I believe that every member of this church has a Bible so if you do not have a Bible uh please buy one if you can't buy one come see us but also I understand there others that leave their Bibles in the church that is very [Music] careless it also means when you go back home you don't read the Bible a Christian should read the Bible every day your Bible is your gun you don't let it go so to you young people who have been leaving your Bibles in the church when we find it we will give it to someone who amen so the deons you know what to do you find a Bible the first time tell the neighbor tell the owner if you find it the second the same same Bible the second time please donate it to someone else who doesn't have so it's a public announcement so it will not be say that my Bible was Sten Genesis 6 verse 5 we are reading up to verse 8 and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord that he had made man on Earth on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the Earth both man and Beast and the creeping thing and the fs of the air for it repenteth me that I have made them but Noah found Grace in the sight of the Lord Brother shame my sound is not yet good my monitors I can't hear myself for [Music] [Music] amen praise the name of the Lord let us pray kind Heavenly Father we humble our before you Lord I'm standing before the purchase of the may you help me Lord and help my brother who is intere because we are useless and powered without you we are weak we are insufficient we are seen as saved by gra but Lord if you please this evening and if we have found favor before your sight I pray that you will help us and use us the benefit of your children both those that are here and those that are streaming the service now and those that shall hear this service later may your presence Lord be made I pray in Jesus name amen be seated so I'm speaking this evening on finding Grace in the eyes of God so now the Bible begins here on verse five by um saying that God saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of thoughts of his heart Contin now remember here we speaking about the time before the flood and so this was before the time that God had destroyed the world with water and this is the reason why actually God decided to destroy the world with water the people's hearts were darkened man had become more and more wicked and to the to the place where the scripture now would say that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continu now do do you know that we as the end time church and really I'm not preaching but I'm speaking to you I want to be looking at you and I want you to be looking at and I not Con on those who are online I'm concentrating on those of you who are here and I want you to imagine this that the Bible if if God himself the holy God gracious God God would come to a place where he would not judge and he would say man is wicked and and then he says that that every imagination of man's was now evil did you know that we have arrived at the same same time where man is wicked where the imaginations of people today are continually evil before and I'm not even talking about people out there I'm talking about people in here what I want you to ask yourself how is the imaginations of your heart every day what did you imagine just take inventory of your own life how were your imaginations from morning up to now how much of the time today did you take thinking about the Lord thinking about the word of goding about the coming of how much time did you spend did you know that God would speak to a prophet in this day and and he told him that tell them that their thoughts are louder in heaven than their what our thoughts before God are much louder than our words God doesn't hear our words because our thoughts supersede our [Music] he says that the imaginations of the people Contin not only one time not only one day but Contin their thought were evil praise the name of the Lord I'm I'm sorry I uh the monitors are not only not bringing the good sound but also there's a big Echo so you really have to help us work on the sound for for for for for a smooth flow of the the ministry sometimes the sound is really perfect sometimes it is very poor like today praise the name of the Lord and so I would like you to um follow closely with me here there's this word here which says continu every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only now that other word [Music] only only evil if I would to if I was to pick one of you and put them here and put a screen and take the imaginations you had today on the screen for all to see how many would want to volunteer I want to be the one for my imaginations to be dis no one is willing to volunteer you see we are back again in the days of no the thoughts of the people's hearts are continually evil if you call yourselves Believers are not willing to volunteer to display your thoughts before everyone how much more those who are in the world you see how bad it has become and the scripture says and it repented God that he had made man on the earth and G him at his heart I believe when God looks at our thoughts he gets grieved when he sees what people are imagining he gets G when he sees what is going on in the hearts of people he gets [Applause] grief I literally grieve God every day you literally grieve God every day and the Lord said I will now destroy man I have from the face of the Earth and and when he God became angry he said I not only destroy man but I also destroy Beast and I also all the creeping thing of the air because it repenteth me that I have made now I want you to see in the mind of of The Sovereign God how man would be in the mind of a sovereign God in the mind of a sovereign God man is unworthy man only deserves judgment man only deserves condemnation and there is only one thing that can save man amen and that is what is called Grace because now he came down on verse 8 and he said but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the [Music] Lord you think that Noah's imaginations were [Applause] good he was just like the rest of but the Bible says no found Grace in the eyes of the Lord now I was finding the word grace in Hebrew it is called which is to mean favor kindness you know undeserved favor gra is the basis of the Christian faith we are we believe we are saved by by faith through Grace now God's grace is usually defined as undeserved favor Grace in other words also is the power of God to help us overcome without Grace we cannot overcome the world none of us has righteousness let me put it this way none of us has the works the amount of works of righteousness that God could best on to take you to the rapt if he did if there was one then God did not need to send his son he did not need to die on the cross but because all man was insufficient all man was in sin all man was unworthy all man was undeserving God himself decided to take it upon himself amen and give something that we did not deserve and Grace is not eared but it is freely given it is God's prerogative to give it to whever he [Applause] will now when when God looks in the whole earth is up to him to whom he will give Grace you know he like like in in that day I'm imagining that there must have been thousands and tens of thousands of people on earth but among all the people who were on Earth God chose one am and he says amen he found Grace in the eyes of the Lord did not do anything to deserve that Grace Noah did nothing but Noah found Grace in the sight of God and of course his family there is something significant that I found in the in the scripture when you find Grace in the eyes of the Lord it is passed on down to your entire generation it is passed on to your children to their wives their children and that is why we have to apply the token upon them when when when when Noah found Grace in the eyes of that meant his sons their wife his wife every one of them found Grace in the eyes of the Lord why because of one man who had found I don't know about you friends but as I was going through this I mared at the grace I found in the eyes of the Lord that I did not do anything to deserve it as a matter of fact every day how I imagine our words our thoughts our actions take us further away from but Grace CL every of our Liv the death of Jesus on the cross what was it for it was to give us Grace everyone gets Grace not everyone gets Grace not everyone how many here can say I found Grace it's a revelation wait until I get I get deep into this I trust that if you came PR prayerfully you will enjoy what the Lord has for us tonight amen the word is just amazing and so lovely not only good to study but also good to hear so I wanted to hear this evening in the message of Grace which is a good message for us to listen to if you can go and he says the grace of God reached over in Noah's timein man and his family but because Noah feared God he believed God you cannot fear God without believing how can you fear something you don't believe you've got to fear God Solomon said the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom just to fear God you are beginning to have wisdom that's why the Bible says those people who don't believe the word they fools the Bible says only the fool say there is no God to those of you who believe the word it means you have the fear of God in your heart you believe in the existence of God you believe this is not a this is a reality and because of that the moment you begin to fear God you are beginning to have wisdom the you you begin to believe the word you are beginning to have wisdom and the fear of God now fear the lord and and he believed the Lord and that's what God honors is your faith in him but now remember Faith through Grace we we have believed on him by faith through Grace without Grace our faith is in vain all right so you see one leads to another and one is connected to the other then when the fear of the Lord come upon Noah God called him by Grace amen and saved him and his house because it was Grace that did it not because Noah was a great big handsome man that oh more than all the rest of them not because Noah went to the church to the best Church there was in the country not because he belonged to the best in organization not because he could dress better you know for us in our church we dress better than any other Church you know our women don't dress that our and that's why we are the bride that's a big mistake we are not the bride because of what we do we are not the bride because of how we look are you hearing me we are not the bright because of what we do not do what we do but we do what we do because we know who we are when you find out when you receive a revelation of who you then you do things and you stop doing things those things that you did all those things you stop doing do not make you who you are how many receive that Hallelujah and so we are not the bride because we do this or don't do that Noah did not find Grace because of he was more handsome he dressed better he was in a better Church actually they have better churches than ours I'm telling you there even denominations have better rules than ours did you know we have organizations that don't actually even believe that a man should even wear a [Music] ring because according to them that is jewelry and when you look at it it is indeed it is so if this is jewelry NE Jew it's the same thing so in their understanding then we should not wear the ring women should not wear necklace you know because these things are sins but did you know that now we in the message we we have levels where by now when one wears a necklace that one is a sinner but where one wears a that one is okay according to [Music] what are you hearing me but our Prophet would come and tell us it's the motive it's the motive behind what you're doing wear Rings because it shows it's a sign when someone would see me wearing a ring oh he's married it's a simp because everybody knows what and when it comes to things like a like a necklace he says okay if your husband lets you wear one it's all right I don't find problem but there be organizations and religions that will tell you all that is sin and where when you do all that you will go to hell so now this message has taken us a level high this message is the message of Grace whereby it has revealed to us the character of Christ whereby we are no longer living under the bondage of the law fear a dreadful God going to come and kill the moment we did something wrong no we are beyond that if you're living below that you not known what the message let me not do this because God will kill me let me do that I will go to hell I have a revelation hell is not my pure to begin it is not even in the mind of God take me to hell because hell was not made for believers hell was made for devils and his angels that is not my portion listen it is not even a portion of any believer why sometimes people want to believe the message of fear because they don't understand their God to those who know their God they know works is only done out of Revelation knowing who you are of knowing who you are before I know I am a woman I will dress like a man before I know I'm a man like a woman right when a little child like this comes up you can even give them a dress and they will wear a dress because they don't have a difference they don't know that when you when you a man you don't wear a dress but let me pick one of you brothers and give you a dress to wear I remember when I was very little now that I remember must have been even Beyond five perhaps my mother used to give me little dresses to wear and many of you brothers did wear right you don't want to say yes but you now you are ashamed because you have a revelation who you are I'm a Manar you see you know who you are when you know who you are you don't do the things the world do because you know you are a royal PR because you know you a king and a PRI you know you supposed to be different and that's why we come to church to be told who we are and the word of God is going on gives us a revelation gives us an understanding of who we are and our Prophet said the true church shall know who she is and what she stands then the devil cannot defeat but the problem is many people live in Amnesia we do not know who we are so it's none of the works that save Noah but because he gives the reason but because of the grace of God God no I repeat that but because of the grace of God God sa no gra no not his work but his grace and also saved his family hallelujah praise God hallu the same Grace that saved me will save my family you ought to say that to yourself the same that served me I serve my father everyone in my I claim the blood upon them hallelujah amen he is a powerful Grace sometimes we do not talk about Grace enough probably Noah was as bad as the people of his time family was not any better but Sav Hallelujah prise God and Grace is powerful I tell you when you find God's grace you have certain privileges that others who have not found it don't how many would like to know such privileges let's go in the Book of Genesis chapter 19 first look at somebody else who found Grace amen I'm now I'm looking at Grace actually today mostly from the Old Testament rather than the old the New Testament so my version of presenting it today is different verse 17 I'm going to read up to verse 22 and it came to pass when they had found when they had brought them forth abroad that he said Escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed and Lord said unto them oh not so my Lord behold now thy servant has found Grace in thy sight and thou Hast magnified thy mercy which thou has showed unto me in saving my life and I cannot escape to the mountain L some evil take me and I die behold now this city is near to flee unto and it is a little one or let me escape the is it not a little one and my soul shall leave and he said unto him see I have accepted thee concerning this thing also that I will not overthrow this city for the which thou has spoken thee ESC for I cannot do anything till thou be there the name of the city was zor you can read for Hallelujah Hallelujah I want you to see Grace today in a different way Grace when when you find Grace in the eyes of the Lord it is unmerited favor something you do not deserve but God gives it to you and once he has given it once you have found that gra you have a priv that no other has I'm going to show you a few examples people that found Grace in the sight of God before I talk about Lord I talk a little bit about Moses how the word of God would even say that you know they should marry among their own and so here is a man of God that actually went Beyond and married an Ethiopian woman and you know ab and K and together with were Justified to come against the man of God because he was out of the word and and and you know when when they they made a team among themselves they said here is what we are going to do the man has error and you know isn't there other people who are spiritual Among Us you see but what did what did Moses have follow me Clos Moses had something all these others had not re Moses had received favor Gra unmerited he had he had it and so when God came down what did he do he told them Moses it's all right that's what they doing let me finish all of them Moses had to intered if Moses did not intercede for them God would fish almost all the Israelites but he Moses stood between them the of God and and you know he told all the others who were standing against him stand on one side and you know how the story went and others were swallowed up under the the so under the soil the Earth swallowed them what was go God trying to demonstr yet Moses was not a perfect man Moses had anger Moses was was a sinner just like the rest of them you know God told him go and strike the rock once and he strike it twice Moses also disobeyed Moses married against the word are you hearing no I'm not justifying wrongdoing but this is what happened in Moses he was not worthy either his life was not worthy of the love of God but here is one thing called Grace PR is more powerful than any sin that there is in the world no matter what a man has done let them find Grace one it will rewrite everything ches of their Liv hallelujah hallelujah and that's what Moses found and God took his side God was bound to do that because of one thing Grace and we find here Lord Lord is as you know he was a he was a a relative of of Abraham you know and and and and here he was uh I think I think it was Abraham's nephew right I know one time I was preaching here and I said he was Abraham's cousin sometimes you just understand what I'm trying to praise the name of the Lord and so lot now the angel of the Lord the two angels go down to pick Lord and his family why because Lord had found Grace in the sight of God understand I don't think that lot was better than L was back lot loved cities when Abraham told him pick where you will go he looked over and saw a big city called he said I go to one of and Abraham went to the desert lot desired always to live in a city I believe maybe he liked soft life maybe he liked something you know a life of no strugg a place where he could be happy with his family things like that and and so he went there and and Abraham let him go there but then now when when God had come down to destroy Sodom lot was right in the middle of did you know that even if you were in the middle of if you find Grace in the eyes of the do you know you cannot perish with did you know you cannot and here he was right in the middle of I believe it was a physical thing but also it meant something figurative because when this man came wanting the the two angels that enter the house Lord reached over to them and he said my brothers he called them his brothers SES I don't think I don't think lot was any better but Lord had found Grace in the eyes of the Lord and when the Angels came into that house you know of course they smart those people with blindness and they Clos thems in and they told Lord it is time for you to flee the city because fire is coming down oh let me tell you brethren we are living in a modern day but we are different may be in the middle of we have receiv the message of GRA Hallelujah and right there they told him time to escape time to escape and it came to pass when they had brought them forth [Applause] abroad

you can be exed brother don't feel don't feel sorry my sister hallelujah amen do I have two people crazy like me today amen hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord in the message the unchangeable god 196 would say every soul that comes to God seeking salvation or healing he's going to come on on those basis he's going to come believing that God is and reward did not our lord Jesus say whatever things you desire When you pray believe that you will receive them and you shall have them Jesus said that the prophet says Jesus said that I am saying the prophetes if you pray Hallelujah amen did not he say ask the father what you will in my receive now that is infallibly the truth and there is nobody that ever ask God but what God gave it to them if they come with unhonest heart if God inspired me to preach this God is anointing someone's face for what they Des Hallelujah if you come to God with a honest heart he will always give you what and the thing of it is God gives it sometimes in in the way that we are not expecting but God always keeps his word so in other words you ask what you want God will give it to you the difference is not all times sometimes he may give it to you in a way you never expected it but not all times sometimes so in other words most of the time gives it to you the way you want the way you expected but the fact is he always anwers a prayer there is no way for God to tell you anything and lie about it and remain God he canot must keep his word forever it is the truth and when the bible say that Jesus Christ is the to Forever you said that is the truth I may not have faith enough to make all the things that he has done live again but I would never stand in the road of somebody who had enough Faith to do if you are believing for a miracle believe for it brother for it sister you don't believe it don't stand in the way of the one who [Music] believe hallelujah amen that's why when the word of God is going on we need to let go of ourself so that we can amen be con spiritually connected to we respond to the word oh how do you respond to the word by saying amen by standing on your feet by possessing shouting accepting if somebody is not getting it let them not stand in your way we are real Pentecostal by experience by experience do I have an M back there by experience I can go and record for this tonight if any people will take the right mental attitude if they would take the right mental attitudes towards any Divine promise that God ever made and claim it is yours [Music] you say it is mine he will God will bring it to pass glory amen hallelujah if you will take the right attitude toward God said so the promise is your if God said so the promise is your if God say the promise is your if God say the promise is your receive it and it's your personal property the very minute you receive it that way hallelujah amen Oh Glory to godu Lord said I want that gave him that that moment he wanted it the very moment you receive it that way becomes your personal it has to come to pass healing becomes the Holy Ghost become Hallelujah am the moment you receive the revelation of the grace of God upon let us give him a CL of Praise T hallelujah amen and Moses to found Grace in the sight of God in Exodus 33 12 and Moses said unto the Lord see thou sayest unto me bring up these people and thou Hast not let me know whom thou will send me with who thou will send with me yet thou Hast said I Know Thee by name and thou Hast also found Grace in my sight now there if I pray therefore I pray thee if I have found Grace in thy sight show me now thy way that I may Know Thee that I may find Grace in thy sight H and consider that this nation is is thy people and he said my presence shall go with thee and I'll give thee rest and he said unto him If thy presence go not with me carry us not up hands for wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found Grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us so shall we be separated I and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth and the Lord God said unto Moses I will do this thing also that thou has spoken Hallelujah for thou Hast found Grace in my sight Hallelujah and I Know Thee by name and he said I beseech thee show me thy glory and he said I make I will make all my goodness pass before thee and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and will be gracious to whom I'll be gracious and will be show Mercy on whom I will show mercy and he said thou can not see my face for there shall no man see my face and live and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my glory passes by that I will put thee in a cliff of The Rock and I will cover thee with my hand while I pass by and I will take away my hand and thou sht see my back Parts Hallelujah but my face shall not be seen can you please read up to 23 [Music] foree for for [Music] I want you to see talking about Moses Moses was a man that was not perfect by the way there is no servant of God on Earth that was ever because all human beings need Grace if there was one perfect then we did not need Grace we did not need Jesus's death on the cross we need salvation but there was only one worthy that is the Lamb of God world but even the greatest of prophets they had their own insufficiency so we find that Moses as he came before the presence of God and God told him now to go and take his people Moses knew this one he wanted to be sure found Grace in the eyes of the Lord by the way that is the only thing you need to be sure of when he says make your calling and election sure means find Grace in the eyes of the Lord be sure that mes wanted to be sure I am going to go but before I go I want to be sure I found Grace in your and he says if I found Grace in your I have a request show me now thy way that I may know the that I may find Grace in your sight you want to know him you want to know him you want to find his way Moses had everything but Moses had hunger said I want to see you iction I know you you have a desire to God experience the bapm of the Holy Ghost you have a desire remember you have found Grace in his sight whatsoever your desire is he gives it to you he gives it to you he gives it to you that is why doesn't answer all prayers especially those of people that have not found Grace but the people who have found Grace in his he calls them my people and he said his my people and pray then I will hear and I will answer so now Moses was aware that he was not anyone found my God I feel like speaking let me tell you there are people on Earth cannot say [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah people cannot say no cannot say no cannot say I will not be I will not be hallelujah amen why because I'm his I am his and his mine and Moses knew that that's why when Moses started asking Moses did not ask for one thing he asked for more he kept on asking ask I believe that if we as Believers can be in prayer we can change the world why because God answers the prayer of Believers hallelujah how many of you was lost in prayer pray you go and close yourself somewhere you see you pray too little that's you receive to but let me challenge us let us turn ourselves into prayer machines let us make it like a challenge in our homes we we begin to pray you know in our homes in our prayer closet individually each of us families husband and and we begin to do prayer Retreats going to begin to see Revival you're going to see God moving in power why because when God hears the prayer of a Believer he lives whatever he's doing Hees whatever he doing say who is that you remember that woman everybody was touching him this woman she was a Believer she was a Believer came tou he left everything who is that who is that that touched Meer said Master everybody's touching me he said no this is a different tou the prayer of a Believer is a different prayer Hallelujah it doesn't need to be saved received no it goes direct to the throne room because you have direct access you have direct access to the when you begin to pray don't you worry you may feel like a sinner you may feel defeated there Grace when you have Grace stand between your and God and then your prayer go Hallelujah and when the devil hears he begins to shake he begins to tremble because he can't understand what is happening what is happening I thought I finish that I that little I thought more what is going something going on when I believer begin to pray why because you have a speci your life brother if you feel defeated don't worry go in prayer go in prayer even if you're messed up when you begin to pray you begin to sh every G of begin sh now I am preaching begin to move that is the power of Grace Hallelujah the power of Grace the power of Grace and Moses knew that when he came before God he was not asking for little he asked abundantly he said show me your way I want to know your with after that he said go with us go with us can you prove you will go with us I go with you if you don't go with us we cannot go how will they know that you are with us you have to go with us and after that he said I'm not about to finish I'm about to finish I want more show me thy Glory Hallelujah God was overwhelmed no man has ever asked him this the request were so big but no request is big for our yourest is not big for God it is not so big for God your prayer will make a way because your prayer Hallelujah is a prayer that has found so you're not just anybody just no you a person of God and when Moses asked this things God said God could not say no God could not say no [Music] will not say to you when Moses prayed all these things sister Grace God did not say no do you know what he did he made a provision you want to see my glory no one has ever seen that said now Moses now you know let me explain something to you if you see me you will die but mother said Show Me Your Glory because he knew he cannot be denied had found in the so now God began as you would say fting what can God remember this was before Jesus was born so God had to bring his and presented but he told him here's what we going to do he began to negotiate God sometimes if he doesn't give you exactly what you he will give it to but in another wayes wanted to seek God himself but God negoti but here is the deal thees he said to him behold there is a place by me and you shall stand upon a rock upon a rock and it shall come to pass now while my glory passes back that I will put thee in the C of the rock you see Moses I'm standing here you can't see me you see me but because you have I can't say no I'm making a provision now there's a place by me going to stand on this Ro and I will pass by and as I pass by I will lift you bless Hallelujah and I will cover you with my hand while I pass and I will take away my heart and you will see my hallelujah hallelujah my face you will not see 5050 you will see my glory you will not see my face because I cannot I cannot afford die God cannot afford for you to die because if see my face you will die God cannot afford my God wants me to be living because we can only worship him in the land of theing hallelu when you ask in prayer ask abundantly don't ask too little because prayer will be answered Ephesian 3:19 the love of Christ which passes to know the love of Christ which passes all knowledge that he might be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able that is able tell your neighbor is able he is able come on tell two of your nebor is able to do exceeding above all we ask all according to the power that works in us what is that power the power of His grace hallelujah hallelujah amen the power of His grace because of that power that works in us he's able he is able I said he able He's Able he able He's Able you can say it too until you believe is he
