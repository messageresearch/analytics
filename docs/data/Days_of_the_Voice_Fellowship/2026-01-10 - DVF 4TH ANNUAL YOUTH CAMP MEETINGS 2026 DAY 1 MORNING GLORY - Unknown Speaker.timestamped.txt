[30:03] David said that I was glad when they

[33:01] think pardon
[33:03] brother says v dancing is a sign of
[33:06] victory but we have some believers I'm
[33:08] sorry to say this
[33:11] who who are so spiritual
[33:13] feel like dancing is evil
[33:18] remember king David
[33:22] after every victory
[33:25] Israelites could celebrate and dance for
[33:27] the Lord
[33:28] and make a joyful noise for the Lord. So
[33:30] don't be so spiritual that I can't
[33:33] dance.
[33:36] You can dance for the Lord. You're not
[33:37] dancing for your neighbor. I'm not
[33:39] dancing for you. If I'm here dancing for
[33:41] the Lord, I'm dancing for the Lord, not
[33:43] for you. One more time. You're going to
[33:46] add some speed.

[37:58] Jesus.
[37:59] Thank you, Lord. We praise you, Father."
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Dear Lord Jesus,
[38:08] &gt;&gt; we are gathered this morning once again
[38:11] for there's always about the morning
[38:13] Father,
[38:16] the beginning of a new day,
[38:19] new hopes,
[38:21] new ambitions and aspirations,
[38:25] and even new expectations. Father,
[38:28] we thank you for this opportunity that
[38:30] you've given us
[38:32] that as young people, we can come
[38:34] together,
[38:37] lift our voices in praise,
[38:41] sit under the teaching of your word
[38:44] that Lord, you can be able to align us
[38:48] with the purpose of God concerning our
[38:50] life.
[38:53] We surrender ourselves to you, Father.
[38:57] Songs of Zion have gone forth.
[39:01] Now it has come a time.
[39:04] Lord, as I stand behind this sacred desk
[39:08] and as your servant, I'm reporting to
[39:09] duty.
[39:12] I pray that you'll have your own way.
[39:16] Lord, may you take the little thoughts
[39:19] and break the bread of life for us.
[39:24] May this service mark a good beginning
[39:25] for us
[39:29] as we even set a pace for the meetings
[39:31] ahead.
[39:34] May your Holy Spirit pick us up
[39:37] and place us in those heavenly places
[39:41] that Lord Jesus Christ this day we shall
[39:43] be real eagles
[39:47] that will get to soar higher and higher
[39:50] in Jesus Christ's name.
[39:53] Amen.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; I greet you all in the name of our Lord
[39:59] Jesus Christ.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; We are quite pressed for time.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; So, we'll just go into the uh scriptures
[40:09] as we appreciate our host pastor.
[40:15] Thank you uh pastor.
[40:18] It's always a blessing to be in this
[40:20] camp.
[40:23] I may not get maybe another chance to
[40:24] say this,
[40:27] but I I appreciate you
[40:30] and I've always said it.
[40:34] We'll always be here to support
[40:37] and stand behind the man of God.
[40:42] We thank the Lord for yet another time.
[40:45] as we open in John chapter one.
[40:49] Uh I want you to preach with me this
[40:51] morning
[40:54] because I want to give a disclaimer.
[40:59] This is not what I plan to preach on.
[41:04] So I really want you to preach with me.
[41:08] Don't be scared. Don't be scared.
[41:11] This brother is saying this is not what
[41:12] he was planning to preach on. Is he not
[41:14] prayed up?
[41:18] By God's grace, I've prayed up.
[41:20] By God's grace, I've studied.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; But I just felt the Lord leading a
[41:25] different direction.
[41:29] The book of book of John chapter one
[41:32] from verse 35.
[41:35] Again, the next day after John stood and
[41:38] two of his disciples and looking upon
[41:41] Jesus as he walked, he said, "Behold the
[41:45] lamb of God.
[41:59] And the two disciples heard him speak
[42:01] and they followed Jesus.
[42:07] There's something happening here.
[42:10] This is the second time
[42:13] that Jesus is being introduced by John.
[42:18] The previous day Jesus had come
[42:21] and he was baptized.
[42:23] And you remember John had introduced
[42:25] him.
[42:27] Behold the lamb of God
[42:30] who takes away the sins of the world.
[42:33] But I want you to notice
[42:35] nobody caught that.
[42:38] It was a change of ministry.
[42:41] But nobody caught it.
[42:45] But on the second day,
[42:48] two disciples
[42:50] heard
[42:52] and they followed Jesus.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; They realized it was a time when Jesus
[42:58] is here, John must decrease,
[43:03] Jesus must increase.
[43:05] So they were able to realize
[43:08] that we no longer need to rely
[43:12] on the sacrifices of bulls and goats.
[43:17] Why? The lamb of God is here
[43:21] and they followed Jesus.
[43:24] And this is why we have a testimony in
[43:26] the book of acts
[43:28] that there were those that were baptized
[43:30] according to the baptism of John
[43:34] and they were asking
[43:36] we didn't even hear about the baptism in
[43:38] Jesus name
[43:40] because their eyes had not been opened
[43:42] at that time
[43:45] but the bible gives us a testimony there
[43:47] were two that follow Jesus
[43:51] and the bible goes down in the ch uh
[43:53] verse 44 before
[43:56] now Philip was of Bethider the city of
[43:59] Andrew and Peter.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Philip findeth Nathaniel and said unto
[44:07] him,
[44:10] "We have found him of whom Moses in the
[44:12] law and the prophets did write, Jesus of
[44:16] Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
[44:23] We've found the fulfillment of
[44:25] scriptures for our day.
[44:29] And Nathaniel said unto him,
[44:32] "Can there any good thing come out of
[44:34] Nazareth?"
[44:38] Philip saith unto him,
[44:41] &gt;&gt; "Come
[44:43] and see,
[44:45] &gt;&gt; precious Lord,
[44:47] May you take this scripture father
[44:51] and break it for us.
[44:53] Open our eyes of understanding
[44:56] that we can see Lord
[44:59] from this text that we shall be speaking
[45:00] on.
[45:03] Precious Holy Spirit.
[45:05] May you give the context
[45:07] in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. You can take your seats.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Uh for just a moment.
[45:16] I want to speak on
[45:20] can there any good thing
[45:23] come out of you?
[45:27] Can there any good thing
[45:29] come out of you?
[45:32] We know the scripture is talking about
[45:33] Nazareth.
[45:36] But now for a moment,
[45:38] I don't want us to look at Nazareth,
[45:41] a city in Israel.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; I want you to look at yourself.
[45:45] But just for a background,
[45:48] we see the events that are taking place
[45:50] here
[45:52] and the statement that Nathaniel makes
[45:55] is something I believe he was warranted
[45:57] to make
[46:00] because Nazareth was not known as a very
[46:02] good city.
[46:04] Maybe it was a place if you passed by at
[46:06] around 10:00 in the night,
[46:10] you'll maybe lose your phone and your
[46:11] wallet.
[46:14] You will meet some goons that will take
[46:15] away your things.
[46:18] Maybe it was a place if you wanted to
[46:20] have the local brew.
[46:23] We call it cha back home.
[46:27] That is the place where the best of the
[46:28] worst was being made
[46:33] in terms of sin.
[46:36] That is why maybe women were walking so
[46:38] naked.
[46:40] Adultery was on the rampage.
[46:44] and all these bad and evil things that
[46:45] were there at that time.
[46:48] It was a lowly city,
[46:51] nothing good could be said about it.
[46:55] And that is when Nathaniel was
[46:56] skeptical.
[46:59] Can there any good thing
[47:02] come out of Nazareth?
[47:04] But I thank the Lord.
[47:07] As much as Philip had an answer,
[47:11] I want to bring the scripture into
[47:12] perspective now
[47:15] because we are living in the worst of
[47:17] all ages.
[47:19] We are living in an age where 200
[47:21] million devils are on the rampage.
[47:26] We know that hell is open.
[47:29] We know that the devil is on the loose.
[47:33] That things are not going to get any
[47:34] better.
[47:36] We know the world is falling apart
[47:40] in dark ludicia
[47:43] where people are blind.
[47:45] They're naked. They're wretched. They're
[47:49] poor. They're miserable. IT IS THE WORST
[47:53] AND WORST of all conditions.
[47:55] You name it. LGBTQ IS on the rise.
[48:00] LGBTQ.
[48:02] Homosexuality is on the rise.
[48:05] Parent delinquency,
[48:08] CHILDREN DELINQUENCY.
[48:09] THE WORLD IS falling apart indeed.
[48:12] ECONOMIES ARE FAILING.
[48:15] Systems are crumbling.
[48:18] Can there ANY GOOD THING
[48:21] COME OUT OF CAMPALA THIS MORNING?
[48:24] CAN THERE BE ANY RIGHTEOUS PEOPLE
[48:27] THAT WILL stand in this day? MY ANSWER
[48:30] TODAY,
[48:32] COME AND SEE.
[48:35] COME AND SEE BECAUSE SOMETHING GOOD CAN
[48:39] COME OUT OF YOU, BROTHER.
[48:41] SOMETHING GOOD CAN COME OUT OF YOU, MY
[48:44] SISTER. YOU'VE GROWN IN A HOME. YOU'VE
[48:47] GROWN IN A HOME WHERE YOU'VE BEEN
[48:50] SCARRED.
[48:51] YOU'VE BEEN TRAUMATIZED.
[48:54] YOU'VE GROWN UP WITH WOUNDS.
[48:56] YOU FEEL LIKE YOU DON'T BELONG.
[48:59] YOU'VE GONE THROUGH BATTLE.
[49:01] THE DEVIL HAS SCARRED YOU.
[49:04] THE DEVIL HAS GIVEN YOU WOUNDS
[49:07] AND YOU'RE WONDERING, "AM I GOING TO
[49:09] MAKE IT? AM I REALLY RAPTURE MATERIAL?
[49:14] AM I REALLY THE PRIDE?" I HAVE AN ANSWER
[49:17] FOR YOU.
[49:19] COME AND SEE because in THE MIDST OF IT
[49:22] ALL, THERE'S A PEOPLE. THERE'S A
[49:26] GENERATION,
[49:27] A GENERATION OF THE RIGHTEOUS.
[49:30] CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?
[49:32] YOUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS
[49:34] IS FILTHY RUGS.
[49:37] YOUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS
[49:39] IS FILTHY RUGS BEFORE THE LORD. THAT'S
[49:43] WHY TODAY I'M NOT DEPENDING ON MY
[49:46] RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[49:47] DON'T DEPEND ON your righteousness
[49:50] BECAUSE NAZARETH
[49:52] COULD NOT DEPEND ON ITS NAME ANYMORE.
[49:56] NAZARETH HAD A BAD NAME.
[49:58] BUT THERE WAS ONE THING. THERE WAS ONE
[50:01] MAN,
[50:03] CAN I TELL YOU HIS NAME?
[50:05] &gt;&gt; HE IS CALLED THE DIFFERENCE MAKER.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; AND I'm introducing to you today,
[50:14] CHRIST.
[50:16] THE DIFFERENCE MAKER.
[50:18] HOW BAD IS YOUR SITUATION?
[50:21] JUST AT CHRIST.
[50:24] BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO CHRIST,
[50:27] THE MOUTH OF CHRIST,
[50:30] CHRIST is a DIFFERENCE MAKER.
[50:33] ONE TIME Elisha
[50:36] goes to the school of prophets.
[50:40] They didn't know
[50:42] HOW TO GIVE THE proper food.
[50:45] They took some wild guads
[50:48] and they put THEM IN THE POT.
[50:51] WHAT CAME OUT OF THAT? THERE WAS DEATH
[50:54] IN THE PORT.
[50:56] AND WHEN DEATH WAS IN THAT PORT,
[50:59] HERE COMES A PROPHET
[51:01] WITH A REVELATION.
[51:04] WHEN THERE IS DEATH IN THE PORT,
[51:06] SHALL BRING CHRIST
[51:09] AND HE TOOK A MEAL OFFERING,
[51:12] WHICH IS THE TYPE OF CHRIST,
[51:14] WHICH IS THE TYPE OF THE WORD, AND HE
[51:17] PUT IT IN THE POT, AND HE PUT IT IN THE
[51:20] POT. THE SAME PEOPLE THAT WERE CRYING,
[51:24] THERE IS DEATH IN THE POT,
[51:27] THEY NOW SANG A NEW SONG.
[51:30] I HAVE NEVER EATEN FOOD LIKE THIS.
[51:33] YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS? IT WAS CHRIST THE
[51:36] DIFFERENCE.
[51:39] I DON'T CARE HOW BAD YOUR SITUATION IS,
[51:42] JUST BRING CHRIST.
[51:44] ARE YOU DEAD SPIRITUALLY?
[51:47] BRING CHRIST.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU DEAD IN YOUR PRAYER LIFE?
[51:52] BRING CHRIST.
[51:53] DON'T YOU KNOW HOW TO READ THE MESSAGE?
[51:56] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU LOOKING FOR REVELATION?
[51:58] DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE?
[52:01] &gt;&gt; CHRIST THE DIFFERENCE MAKER.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; PREACH THE DIFFERENCE.
[52:06] AMEN.
[52:09] We are putting things into perspective
[52:11] now.
[52:12] We are putting things into perspective
[52:16] because all the GOOD PREACHINGS,
[52:19] ALL THE WONDERFUL REVELATIONS
[52:22] that will come from this sacred death
[52:25] WITHOUT CHRIST
[52:27] WILL AMOUNT TO NOTHING.
[52:30] BUT WITH CHRIST,
[52:32] SOMETHING GOOD
[52:34] WILL COME OUT OF NAZARETH.
[52:37] BECAUSE AS LONG AS JESUS WAS IN
[52:39] NAZARETH,
[52:42] THERE IS SOMETHING WE CALL
[52:44] THERE WAS a possibility.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; And I WANT TO TELL YOU TODAY
[52:51] THERE IS A POSSIBILITY.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; WHEN JESUS IS IN NAZARETH,
[52:56] the lame
[52:58] COULD WALK. THE BLIND COULD SEE. THE
[53:03] SICK WILL BE HEALED. THE DEAD WILL BE
[53:08] RAISED. SO TELL ME CHURCH,
[53:12] &gt;&gt; CAN SOMETHING GOOD
[53:14] &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF NAZARETH?
[53:18] AMEN.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; When Jesus is there,
[53:25] &gt;&gt; something good
[53:26] can come OUT OF NAZARETH.
[53:29] AND IN YOUR SITUATION,
[53:31] JUST BRING JESUS.
[53:33] AND LET ME TELL YOU FRIENDS,
[53:36] JESUS KEEPS ALL HIS APPOINTMENT.
[53:41] NO MATTER HOW BAD THE SITUATION IS,
[53:44] YOU THINK THAT your life is filthy.
[53:48] Let me tell you, he went to the grave OF
[53:51] LAZARUS
[53:53] THAT WAS THINKING
[53:55] THAT WAS SMELLING
[53:57] BUT BRING JESUS.
[54:00] LAZARUS
[54:02] &gt;&gt; COME FORTH
[54:03] &gt;&gt; AND IN THIS MEETINGS
[54:06] THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE LAZARUS
[54:10] THEY ARE DEAD THEY ARE STINKING BUT TO
[54:14] THAT EQUATION
[54:16] BRING JESUS
[54:18] AND I CAN TELL YOU FOR SURE WHEN JESUS
[54:21] CAME HE DIDN'T SAY COME FORTH AND THE
[54:27] PROPHET OF GOD TELLS US
[54:29] &gt;&gt; THAT IF JESUS WOULD HAVE SAID COME FORTH
[54:33] THEN ALL THE GRAVES
[54:36] WOULD HAVE OPENED.
[54:38] BUT JESUS is a particular man.
[54:43] JESUS IS SPECIFIC TO the dots.
[54:48] The preaching OF THE WORD
[54:51] IS THE CALLING of the name.
[54:55] When the preacher IS PREACHING,
[54:58] HE MAY NOT MENTION YOUR NAME,
[55:01] BUT HE CAN MENTION YOUR CONDITION.
[55:04] HE CAN MENTION YOUR SITUATION.
[55:07] THAT IS THE TIME FOR YOU TO SIT READY
[55:12] BECAUSE RIGHT THERE,
[55:14] DEATH
[55:16] IS ABOUT TO LOSE ITS GRIP.
[55:19] SIN IS ABOUT TO LOSE ITS GRIP.
[55:23] THAT ADDICTION
[55:25] IS ABOUT TO LOSE ITS SCRIPTURE
[55:28] BECAUSE THE PREACHING OF THE WORD IS THE
[55:31] CALLING OF THE NAMES.
[55:33] AND WHEN YOU HEAR YOUR NAME, YOU SAID
[55:36] JESUS,
[55:38] &gt;&gt; HERE I AM.
[55:40] RESPOND BROTHER,
[55:42] RESPOND, SISTER,
[55:44] MAY WE NOT COME TO THIS PLACE
[55:47] AND GO THE WAY WE CAME BECAUSE CHRIST
[55:50] THE DIFFERENCE MAKER.
[55:53] IN THE CUP TODAY.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; GLORY. HALLELUJAH.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus is in the camp.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; What's your need?
[56:06] &gt;&gt; What's your trouble?
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Do you have to wait until the last
[56:09] service?
[56:12] You have to wait until tomorrow.
[56:15] My moment will be on the last service.
[56:19] That is when I'm going to RECEIVE MY
[56:20] BREAKTHROUGH.
[56:23] JESUS CHRIST
[56:25] &gt;&gt; IS THE SAME YESTERDAY
[56:27] AND EVEN RIGHT NOW
[56:29] &gt;&gt; AND IN THE OTHER SERVICES
[56:32] RESPOND
[56:33] &gt;&gt; TO THE CALLING OF YOUR NAME.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Haven't we feasted? Haven't we feasted?
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Haven't we feasted?
[56:50] But I have a question for you.
[56:52] What happens next?
[56:55] We heard about the disguised ministry
[56:59] and the anointing of the lion.
[57:02] If you fail to identify yourself WITH
[57:04] THAT,
[57:07] ALL that becomes intellectual knowledge.
[57:11] But I want to see yourself like a David.
[57:15] David didn't know WHO HE REALLY WAS.
[57:19] THE COMING OF SAMUEL.
[57:21] SAMUEL was the one carrying
[57:25] the mystery of his life.
[57:29] HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT
[57:31] I'm just a little shepherd boy
[57:35] that has been sidelined by my family.
[57:39] AT THE COMING OF SOMEONE
[57:42] MADE HIM REALIZE
[57:44] YOU ARE ORDAINED
[57:47] TO be a king. HE WAS ANOINTED.
[57:51] HE WAS ELECTED.
[57:53] HE WAS ANOINTED
[57:55] WAITING for the placement AT SOME POINT
[57:59] AND THE MESSAGE HAS COME
[58:01] SO THAT YOU CAN IDENTIFY
[58:04] THAT even before the foundation OF THE
[58:06] WORLD
[58:08] SAINTS. COME ON.
[58:10] COME ON CHURCH. WE HAVE RECEIVED A
[58:12] POWERFUL MESSAGE.
[58:15] OUR SEL HAS COME
[58:17] WITH THE REVELATION
[58:19] OF WHO WE ARE.
[58:22] I am going to tell you this morning
[58:25] what was in the BACK PART OF GOD'S mind
[58:30] before God was God
[58:33] and what did he say
[58:35] you were there
[58:43] I I wish you had the time to read the
[58:44] scriptures
[58:47] &gt;&gt; the Bible the book of Job
[58:49] who can get A CLEAN THING
[58:53] OUT OF AN UNCLEAN THING.
[58:56] WHO CAN GET A RIGHTEOUS PEOPLE?
[59:00] OUT OF DARK LUDITION,
[59:04] WHO CAN DO THAT?
[59:06] CHRIST,
[59:07] &gt;&gt; THE DIFFERENCE MAKER.
[59:12] AMEN.
[59:14] Are you seeing it?
[59:17] &gt;&gt; This is the main thing.
[59:19] YOU AND I TO BE IDENTIFIED
[59:23] WITH A JOSHUA AND CALB GENERATION.
[59:27] THE ONE THING THAT CALB REALIZED
[59:31] knew
[59:33] there's a portion for ME
[59:36] AND YOUR FAITH
[59:38] NEEDS TO RISE TO THAT LEVEL
[59:42] WHERE YOU KNOW
[59:44] RAPTURE IS MINE.
[59:46] BODY CHANGE IS MIND.
[59:49] THE HOLY GHOST IS MINE. BECAUSE WITHOUT
[59:52] THAT REALIZATION
[59:54] WE WILL BE COMING TO CAMP AFTER CAMP
[59:56] AFTER CAMP.
[59:59] BUT REALIZE
[1:00:01] YOU ARE THOSE LITTLE ONES
[1:00:05] IN THE LITTLE BOOK
[1:00:08] AND I SAW ANOTHER MIGHTY ANGEL COME DOWN
[1:00:10] FROM HEAVEN
[1:00:12] WITH AN OPEN BOOK IN HIS HAND.
[1:00:16] WHAT WERE THE CONTENTS OF THAT BOOK?
[1:00:20] YOU.
[1:00:22] WHY IN THAT BOOK?
[1:00:26] AMEN.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; And at this time,
[1:00:31] he's coming to redeem HIS OWN.
[1:00:34] YOU AND I, THAT WERE IN THE PAWN SHOP,
[1:00:39] THAT WERE IN FILNESS.
[1:00:44] BUT IT COMES TO SAY,
[1:00:46] "THIS IS NOT YOUR RIGHTFUL PLACE.
[1:00:50] YOUR PLACE
[1:00:52] IS RIGHT BY MY SIDE.
[1:00:55] AND WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT,
[1:00:58] SIN WILL shake off from you
[1:01:02] because YOU SEE
[1:01:04] YOUR LIFE
[1:01:06] IS PRE-PLANNED.
[1:01:09] SO NOW YOU'RE CHECKING YOUR CURRENT
[1:01:11] CONDITION
[1:01:14] with a blueprint
[1:01:17] THAT GOD PUT DOWN.
[1:01:20] SO IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING
[1:01:22] THAT IS NOT IN LINE WITH THE BLUEPRINT,
[1:01:26] YOU BECOME LIKE THAT LITTLE EGO
[1:01:29] WHO KNEW
[1:01:31] WHEN SHE WATCHED
[1:01:33] THE MAMA EGO IN THE SKY.
[1:01:36] SHE SAW herself
[1:01:42] big
[1:01:44] like mine.
[1:01:46] No wonder I was not able to eat the
[1:01:47] grain
[1:01:50] wings
[1:01:52] like mine.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; CLOTHES
[1:01:57] LIKE MINE.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; But here's the thing.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; The little igllet
[1:02:04] had never exercised.
[1:02:10] Amen.
[1:02:12] Amen.
[1:02:14] GOD
[1:02:16] PUT YOU HERE
[1:02:18] to be a king and a priest
[1:02:21] BUT
[1:02:23] YOU HAVE NEVER EXERCISED.
[1:02:26] So when the realization STRIKES YOU
[1:02:31] now start EXERCISING
[1:02:36] AS A KING
[1:02:38] MINE IS TO RULE.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; I rule over sin.
[1:02:44] I rule over the flesh.
[1:02:46] I RULE OVER MY PHONE.
[1:02:49] I RULE OVER MY LAPTOP.
[1:02:51] I RULE OVER MY TIME.
[1:02:54] I RULE OVER MY FEET.
[1:02:57] I RULE OVER MY EYES.
[1:03:00] I RULE OVER MY HANDS.
[1:03:02] WHY? I AM A KING.
[1:03:06] SO IF YOU ALLOW YOURSELF
[1:03:09] to live below THE STANDARD OF A KING,
[1:03:12] THAT IS UP TO YOU.
[1:03:15] BUT YOU NEED TO know
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; the realization
[1:03:22] of relationship.
[1:03:25] He didn't come to make him a son.
[1:03:28] He was already a SON TO START WITH.
[1:03:32] THE FATHER just needed to align
[1:03:35] his thinking
[1:03:38] his CONDUCT
[1:03:40] SO THAT he can behave like a son.
[1:03:45] YOU ARE A SON OF GOD.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE A DAUGHTER of God. AND THE
[1:03:52] PREACHING OF THE WORD IS COMING TO MAKE
[1:03:55] YOU ALIGN
[1:03:57] with who you really are.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:04:05] So we see that nothing good
[1:04:09] would have been said about Nazareth.
[1:04:12] Nothing good could be said about you
[1:04:14] maybe.
[1:04:15] But one thing stands for sure.
[1:04:18] When Christ the difference maker comes
[1:04:19] on the scene,
[1:04:21] he makes everything all right.
[1:04:24] Let's pick Abraham,
[1:04:26] an old man with a promise of God. He
[1:04:30] tried to work things out his own way.
[1:04:33] He caught Ishmael instead
[1:04:36] catching up with him.
[1:04:38] And God waited
[1:04:41] until that time.
[1:04:43] that he was old,
[1:04:45] his skin was wrinkled,
[1:04:48] there was no strength in him.
[1:04:51] SARAH'S WOMB WAS DEAD.
[1:04:54] There was no way she could have had
[1:04:55] pleasure with her husband.
[1:04:58] BUT AT THAT POINT,
[1:05:01] THAT IS WHEN GOD COMES.
[1:05:03] WHEN THE SITUATION IS BAD,
[1:05:06] YOU YOUR STRENGTH HAS FAILED.
[1:05:09] YOUR ABILITIES HAVE COME TO AN END. THEN
[1:05:12] HE COMES AND SAYS, "I AM EL SHAI
[1:05:17] THE STRENGTH GIVER,
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; THE DOUBLE BREASTED GOD.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; COME AND NURSE FROM ME
[1:05:24] AND WE COME TO CAMP
[1:05:26] SO THAT WE CAN NURSE FROM HIM.
[1:05:29] COME AND NURSE.
[1:05:31] COME AND GET SOME STRENGTH."
[1:05:34] WHY? THERE'S A POSSIBILITY
[1:05:37] IN THIS WORST CONDITION.
[1:05:40] SOMETHING GOOD CAN COME OUT OF ABRAHAM.
[1:05:45] SOMETHING GOOD CAN COME OUT OF S.
[1:05:52] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:55] Praise the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:05:58] Let's look at Samson.
[1:06:00] Someone that we know
[1:06:02] had really failed terribly.
[1:06:05] He gave his strength to God.
[1:06:08] But he's had two women
[1:06:10] and it got to a point
[1:06:13] where his sh his his head was shaved.
[1:06:16] We were speaking about restoration
[1:06:18] yesterday, right?
[1:06:21] And you are living in another time of
[1:06:23] restoration.
[1:06:26] Maybe you've been having some delila
[1:06:28] over the years
[1:06:30] and they have shaved OFF YOUR HAIR.
[1:06:33] THEY HAVE SHAVED OFF YOUR glory
[1:06:36] and you now feel like a waste.
[1:06:40] There is nothing good that can come out
[1:06:41] of you.
[1:06:43] Samson remembered one thing.
[1:06:46] Samson remembered the parents.
[1:06:49] Samson remembered the mother.
[1:06:52] SAMSON REMEMBERED THE FATHER.
[1:06:55] WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO SAMSON?
[1:06:57] SAMSON WAS BEING RESTORED.
[1:07:01] AND WHEN HE REALIZED
[1:07:03] that I have fallen
[1:07:06] from the standard that God had given to
[1:07:08] my parents.
[1:07:10] AND WHEN YOU REALIZE
[1:07:12] THAT YOU HAVE FALLEN FROM THE STANDARD
[1:07:16] THAT GOD GAVE THE APOSTLES,
[1:07:20] THEN you get INTO A CONDITION
[1:07:22] WHERE YOU START LOOKING UP TO GOD
[1:07:26] AND TELL GOD,
[1:07:28] ONE MORE TIME.
[1:07:30] AND SAMSON WAS THERE AND HE HAPPENED TO
[1:07:33] TOUCH HIS HEAD ONE TIME
[1:07:35] AND HE FELT THAT THERE WAS some hair
[1:07:36] that had grown.
[1:07:39] AND GOD BRING YOU TO A PLACE
[1:07:42] WHERE YOU ARE CONNECTED WITH YOUR HEAD
[1:07:44] WHICH IS CHRIST
[1:07:47] AND YOU CAN TOUCH HIM
[1:07:49] and you can feel that he's there.
[1:07:54] Hallelujah. Do not do not overthink it.
[1:07:58] But when I'm speaking about your head,
[1:08:01] I'm speaking about Christ. I'M SPEAKING
[1:08:03] ABOUT A HEAD. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT a
[1:08:05] literal head.
[1:08:07] BECAUSE WHEN SAMSON TOUCHED THE HEAD,
[1:08:11] SAMSON FELT the hair
[1:08:13] and he knew the covenant
[1:08:17] is joined WITH THE HAIR. AS LONG AS MY
[1:08:22] GLORY IS THERE,
[1:08:24] THAT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY.
[1:08:26] AND AS LONG AS I'M IN THE WORD,
[1:08:30] AS LONG AS I'M ONE WITH THE WORD,
[1:08:33] WHATSOEVER YOU ASK
[1:08:35] IN MY NAME, it shall be given unto you.
[1:08:39] So here was assumption
[1:08:42] eyes were gone,
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; but the hair was still there. The
[1:08:46] prophet might be gone.
[1:08:49] The eyes stand for prophetic insight,
[1:08:52] but the hair was there. What was the
[1:08:54] hair? The headship was there.
[1:08:58] The glory was there. And Samson knew IF
[1:09:02] GOD HAS RESTORED MY HAIR,
[1:09:06] then definitely
[1:09:08] something good can come out of me.
[1:09:12] You've come to camp.
[1:09:14] If you're CRYING FOR RESTORATION,
[1:09:17] YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE
[1:09:19] because God IS A RESTORER.
[1:09:23] HE RESTORES YOUR JOY. HE RESTORES YOUR
[1:09:26] PEACE.
[1:09:27] WHATEVER THE ENEMY HAS TAKEN,
[1:09:30] THIS IS A TIME SOMETHING GOOD CAN COME
[1:09:34] OUT OF YOUR PROUD.
[1:09:36] IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW THE DEVIL IS
[1:09:39] WREING
[1:09:41] HOW THE enemy is blocking your way.
[1:09:44] He blocked the way of the children of
[1:09:46] Israel.
[1:09:48] And the prophet says
[1:09:51] that God
[1:09:53] looked down at the Red Sea
[1:09:56] with fiery angry eyes.
[1:10:02] So God
[1:10:04] looks at situations in YOUR LIFE
[1:10:07] THAT HINDER YOU
[1:10:10] and it is upon you.
[1:10:13] Can something good come OUT OF MOSES?
[1:10:19] SOMEONE that was weak
[1:10:21] RAISED IN EGYPTIAN KNOWLEDGE
[1:10:24] AND THERE CAME A TIME
[1:10:26] THAT HE MET God
[1:10:29] and God told him
[1:10:31] I have heard the cry
[1:10:35] of my children
[1:10:37] and I
[1:10:40] am NOW COME
[1:10:42] I HAVE NOT SENT AN ANGEL
[1:10:45] I I'VE COME.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID MOSES REALIZE?
[1:10:51] The seventh seal mystery
[1:10:54] broke before MOSES RIGHT THERE.
[1:10:57] WHAT IS THE SEVENTH SEAL?
[1:11:00] THE COMING OF THE LORD.
[1:11:03] MOSES REALIZED.
[1:11:05] IF I AM WAITING FOR GOD TO COME,
[1:11:09] IF YOU'RE WAITING
[1:11:11] FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS TO COME,
[1:11:14] YOU HAVE FAILED. BECAUSE MOSES REALIZED,
[1:11:19] I
[1:11:20] AM THE COMING
[1:11:22] OF THE LORD.
[1:11:24] REVELATION CHAPTER 19.
[1:11:27] BEHOLD, THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB HAS
[1:11:30] COME AND HIS WIFE HAS MADE HERSELF
[1:11:34] READY.
[1:11:36] WHAT WAS SHE DRESSED IN?
[1:11:39] I
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE PREACHING IN FRONT.
[1:11:42] WHAT IS THE BRIDE
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; DRESSED IN?
[1:11:46] SHE IS DRESSED IN THE RIGHTEOUSNESS
[1:11:50] OF SAINTS.
[1:11:52] BROTHER, SISTER, REALIZE
[1:11:55] YOU ARE THE GENERATION
[1:11:58] OF THE RIGHTEOUS. IF YOU'RE WAITING FOR
[1:12:01] SOMETHING
[1:12:03] UNTO YOU BECAUSE I CAME TO TELL YOU, YOU
[1:12:08] ARE THE FULFILLMENT
[1:12:11] of this scripture.
[1:12:15] So I'm asking this morning.
[1:12:18] Can something good
[1:12:21] come out of you?
[1:12:23] Can something good come out of you?
[1:12:28] I have an answer.
[1:12:30] Come to PDN.
[1:12:32] Come and see. The righteousness of God
[1:12:35] is here.
[1:12:37] The righteousness of God is here.
[1:12:40] Take the words with a strong hand of
[1:12:43] faith.
[1:12:45] And you will see the devil flee.
[1:12:48] What's your situation?
[1:12:50] What's your circumstance?
[1:12:52] Is it a bad name? Is it a bad name?
[1:12:56] Crush the difference maker.
[1:12:58] Is it a bad habit?
[1:13:02] Christ the difference maker.
[1:13:04] Is it a complex
[1:13:06] an addiction?
[1:13:10] The difference maker
[1:13:13] is right here.
[1:13:15] We are not depending on righteousness.
[1:13:18] We are depending on the righteousness
[1:13:21] of our Lord Jesus.
[1:13:24] In the message that day on Calvary,
[1:13:30] Hallelujah.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Stand up on our feet.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Says
[1:13:37] there's a highway made.
[1:13:40] There's a telephone set in there.
[1:13:44] There's a line to glory.
[1:13:47] Brings every person in reach of that
[1:13:48] line.
[1:13:51] If a man is full of sin,
[1:13:54] it connected him in on central
[1:13:58] He can be forgiven of that sin.
[1:14:01] Not only that,
[1:14:03] but that sin is paid for.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; This is the righteousness we're talking
[1:14:12] about.
[1:14:14] We cannot depend on our own
[1:14:15] righteousness.
[1:14:16] We are depending on the finished work of
[1:14:18] Calvary.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't have to say,
[1:14:24] "I'm not worthy. Sure you're not.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; You never could be.
[1:14:31] But a worthy one,
[1:14:34] took your place.
[1:14:37] He became sinner
[1:14:39] so that you CAN BECOME THE RIGHTEOUSNESS
[1:14:42] OF GOD.
[1:14:45] Where is the generation of the
[1:14:46] righteous?
[1:14:48] It is right.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Abraham believed in God.
[1:14:55] And it was accounted to him
[1:14:59] for righteousness.
[1:15:05] Amen.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; I wanted to preach on righteousness by
[1:15:09] faith.
[1:15:12] But I feel those thoughts are streaming
[1:15:13] in now. But one took your place.
[1:15:17] You are free.
[1:15:20] You don't have to wonder anymore.
[1:15:23] You don't have to be a pleasure seeking
[1:15:25] man to open your eyes.
[1:15:29] For there's a fountain filled with blood
[1:15:32] drawn from Emanuel's veins.
[1:15:34] Sin has plunged beneath the blood.
[1:15:38] They lose all their guilty state.
[1:15:43] Catch this now.
[1:15:46] You don't have to be lost.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; You don't HAVE TO BE LOST.
[1:15:53] YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE LOST.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; You don't have TO LIVE IN SIN.
[1:16:00] YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE FETED.
[1:16:02] You don't have TO LIVE SHACKLED.
[1:16:05] DO NOT BE like ch
[1:16:09] that he was set free
[1:16:12] but was a prison in his mind.
[1:16:16] He is set free
[1:16:18] but doesn't want to fly
[1:16:20] because his mind IS ALREADY CAGED.
[1:16:23] DO not be a crow.
[1:16:26] Be an eagle.
[1:16:28] So you don't have to be lost.
[1:16:33] Something that has bound you
[1:16:36] doesn't have to bind you anymore.
[1:16:39] There's a highway and a way
[1:16:42] and it's called the way of holiness.
[1:16:45] The unclean don't pass over it.
[1:16:49] FOR HE COMES THROUGH THE FOUNTAIN FIRST
[1:16:54] and then he enters the highway.
[1:16:58] He broke the powers of Satan.
[1:17:01] He opened the prison doors of hell
[1:17:04] to every man that was shut up in this
[1:17:06] earth
[1:17:09] in the prisons fearing that when he died
[1:17:13] what death would be to him
[1:17:16] on Calvary
[1:17:18] he opened those cell doors.
[1:17:22] Let every captive go free.
[1:17:26] You don't have to no longer be torn DOWN
[1:17:29] BY SIN.
[1:17:34] YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[1:17:37] YOU DON'T HAVE TO NO LONGER YIELD your
[1:17:39] members to sin,
[1:17:43] drinking,
[1:17:45] smoking,
[1:17:46] gambling,
[1:17:48] telling lies. YOU DON'T HAVE TO YIELD
[1:17:50] your members to sin.
[1:17:54] You don't HAVE TO YIELD YOUR MEMBERS TO
[1:17:55] GOSSIP.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO lead your members TO
[1:17:58] FEEL THE LIVING.
[1:18:02] PORNOGRAPHY IN THE FIELD OF THIS WORLD.
[1:18:05] YOU DON'T have to yield your members to
[1:18:06] immorality.
[1:18:09] You don't have to yield your members TO
[1:18:10] SOCIAL MEDIA
[1:18:13] AND THE FASHIONS of this world.
[1:18:16] You can be honest.
[1:18:20] You can be honest.
[1:18:27] Amen.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN BE HONEST.
[1:18:30] YOU CAN BE JUST,
[1:18:33] YOU CAN BE UPRIGHT.
[1:18:35] YOU CAN BE RIGHTEOUS.
[1:18:38] YOU CAN BE HOLY. YOU CAN BE AN
[1:18:40] OVERCOMER.
[1:18:42] WHY? WE ARE NOT RELYING ON OUR
[1:18:44] RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[1:18:46] JESUS PAID IT ALL.
[1:18:49] ALL TO HIM I OWE.
[1:18:55] You can be honest.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; I would really want us to read this.
[1:19:02] You can be honest.
[1:19:04] You can be just
[1:19:07] You can be upright.
[1:19:11] You can read your Bible and pray every
[1:19:13] day.
[1:19:16] You can read the message every day.
[1:19:19] You can be getting time to consecrate
[1:19:20] yourself before THE LORD EVERY DAY.
[1:19:23] YES, YOU CAN.
[1:19:26] IN THE MIDST OF LICIA,
[1:19:28] WHERE PEOPLE ARE SO BUSY,
[1:19:30] YOU CAN.
[1:19:34] AMEN.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; This last part is what I want you to
[1:19:39] see.
[1:19:41] And I do not know why the devil is
[1:19:42] fighting it.
[1:19:45] The message that day on Calvary,
[1:19:49] paragraph
[1:19:51] 64,
[1:19:55] you love the Lord Jesus.
[1:20:01] Once I finish this, I'll be done.
[1:20:06] But I feel like if I go without using
[1:20:07] this or without us reading this,
[1:20:12] my mission will be accomplished.
[1:20:18] Do you love the Lord?
[1:20:21] Do you believe you're the generation of
[1:20:22] the righteous?
[1:20:25] My righteousness
[1:20:27] is filthy rags before him.
[1:20:31] But his righteousness
[1:20:34] upon me, he will accept.
[1:20:38] So today
[1:20:40] in this camp
[1:20:42] we are stripping off the old garments.
[1:20:48] Amen.
[1:20:50] When the prodigal son came back,
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; he laid aside
[1:20:55] the old tattered garments
[1:20:59] and the father called for the best robe.
[1:21:04] This is what we are doing.
[1:21:07] Your righteousness
[1:21:09] has to be stripped
[1:21:11] and you have to be clothed
[1:21:13] in the righteousness of God.
[1:21:16] Have you seen it? Paragraph 64.
[1:21:22] The message that day on Calvary.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. You don't have the table. This
[1:21:30] is this is a song.
[1:21:33] Ah yes. This is it. You don't have to no
[1:21:35] longer yield your members to sin.
[1:21:39] cheating, smoking, gambling, telling
[1:21:41] lies.
[1:21:43] You can be honest, just and upright
[1:21:50] and Satan
[1:21:52] can do nothing
[1:21:55] about it.
[1:21:58] So yes,
[1:22:00] you Yes.
[1:22:15] in dark cloud
[1:22:18] in Satan's Eden
[1:22:21] where the people are worshiping the god
[1:22:23] of this evil.
[1:22:27] It is payback time
[1:22:31] Satan
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; you came to my Eden
[1:22:35] and perverted what I had greed.
[1:22:39] But now the tables are turning
[1:22:43] right in Satan's edge.
[1:22:46] GOD IS PICKING HIMSELF A PEOPLE.
[1:22:50] GOD IS GETTING HIMSELF A BRIDE,
[1:22:54] A CHOSEN GENERATION,
[1:22:57] A ROYAL PRIESTHOOD,
[1:22:59] A PECULIAR PEOPLE,
[1:23:02] A GENERATION OF THE RIGHTEOUS,
[1:23:06] AND SATAN
[1:23:08] CAN DO NOTHING
[1:23:10] ABOUT IT.
[1:23:13] God bless you. Let's stand up.
[1:23:16] Amen.
[1:23:20] Amen.
[1:23:22] So today
[1:23:24] he's a bluff
[1:23:28] and he'll forever be a bluff.
[1:23:31] So as the preaching of the word goes
[1:23:32] forth.
[1:23:34] Receive it with joy.
[1:23:37] Receive it with faith.
[1:23:39] Possess the gates of THE ENEMY.
[1:23:42] FOOTSTEPS MEAN POSSESSION.
[1:23:46] THE DOOR IS OPEN FOR YOU.
