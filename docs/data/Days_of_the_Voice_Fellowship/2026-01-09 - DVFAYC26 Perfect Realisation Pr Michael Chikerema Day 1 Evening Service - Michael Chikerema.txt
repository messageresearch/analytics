TRANSCRIPT
========================================
With your power of miracles, there is nothing a simple and we standing here only because You made a way. You made a way. You made a way. Oh, pass. I looked as if it was over. You made our way. Now we're standing here only because you may for a moment just speak to the Lord tonight. Worship his wonderful. Hallelujah. Speak to him your own way in your own words. Hallelujah. He made a way when passing him in the wind. Oh. Oh, hallelujah. That's where You made our way. You made our way. When I bounce against the wall, no words, you make my way. And we're standing here only because you made a way. Just one more time. Oh, you made a way. Yes, you made our way. When I b against the wall and it looked as if it was over, you made our way and we're standing only You made our way and we standing here only because you made our way. Amen. Amen. Praise God. Wow. We are only here because the Lord has made a way for us to be here. I know these preachers you see here have sacrificed a lot to be here. Each one of them and I mean we can speak about each of them what they have sacrificed how they came to be here today. And pastor Michael &gt;&gt; is not a man that uh has been doing a lot of trouble in the recent past. Uh he's a man I got to know when I visited with them in in Path in the city of Path, Western Australia. Australia. He told me he doesn't travel much because of course he's been concentrating on the church there, the work. I can tell you he's doing quite a lot of work there. Currently, they're trying to, you know, get a building of their own. It's not been easy for him to travel, especially during this season. God has made a way for him to be here. We we appreciate it pastor Michael and I know many of you have sacrificed to be here. Let me let me just see if you can be seated. Let the Kenyans remain standing. Those who came from Nairobi. I want you to look at the team that came from Nairobi. Let's really give them a mighty hand. &gt;&gt; Look at look at another Kenyan. I want to say while you are still standing, brethren from Nairobi, we really appreciate your sacrifice. You have been a part of our story from the very beginning. I remember the very first come, brother Isaac who is eventually seated uh was uh one of our camp speakers and I remember also brother Ken. &gt;&gt; Do you appreciate these two brothers? Amen. and and so uh and when they came they to the land they said the land is good ever since that first come every year we've had a group from their church and I know I know it comes with a lot of cost a lot of sacrifice and I want to assure you it cannot be for nothing for nothing when you come, you are an encouragement to us and we hope that we are an encouragement to you and I understand there was a few hiccups today on arrival and we regret that we personally I did not know I was just made know made to know that but I can assure you next time we'll do better next time we'll do better thank you for coming let us give them a Amen. Amen. Amen. So we are now going to receive the word. I remember there was a time I was driving from uh some place about 7 hours away from Kala and uh I saw this sermon title that pastor Michael preached and it was something that I was talking about also at church. I said okay let me see how he approached it. And I put put it on. I I was not meaning to listen to the whole sermon. I can tell you that for sure to be sincere. But I listened to all of it. I put on another one for about three sermons. And with all the young people that were in the car, we enjoyed it thoroughly. Every word that was coming out of his mouth was the word. And he wanted to write down. And I was driving. I could not write down, &gt;&gt; you know. So, I I believe we are going to receive a gastronomical jubilee. So, uh so let's let's have this before we go to rest. How many are still under expectation? Amen. And so, let's just open our hearts. Don't close up. Don't don't listen to your mind. You might be tired, but don't listen to your body. Just give it um some time and let the Lord speak to you one more time and then after that we shall go uh to have some rest and then be here uh 6 I think 6 something we'll see the time later 6 something in the morning for the morning devotion brother Ken will be speaking to us. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us stand as we welcome the world. &gt;&gt; Let us sing that one more time. You made a way. body. &gt;&gt; Amen. You made our way. You made our way. the Lord when our backs were against the wall and it looked as if it was over you made our way Cuz you move mountains, you cause to fall with your power. Heat. Heat. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I would like to greet you all in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I think I have to say that again. I would like to greet you all in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now that's something now. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I want you to know that I'm quite conscious of your tired, weary bodies, your tired minds. And you have every reason to shut out of this service if we are looking in the natural. But because we are not gathered here for natural reasons, Praise the Lord. We have no reason to shut out. How many How many agree with me? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, we are still under expectation. I will not take too much time into uh introductions but I just want to salute the host uh brother want to appreciate him extending the invitation to come. I would want to also take this opportunity to appreciate his wife sister because they say behind every great man is a great woman. Amen. But it's been a blessing to meet with my brother to get to know him and obviously share uh on what the Lord is doing with us in this region and internationally. And so you you you you you share with the brother, you see the vision, &gt;&gt; and it's something that you would like to at least put your shoulder to the wheel, so to speak. And so I count it certainly a privilege to be here. Praise the Lord. Amen. I would like to salute all the men of God that are there. Praise the Lord. And I want to also acknowledge the pastors of the various people that came. Maybe the pastors are not here, but at least members of their churches are here. Want to salute them and acknowledge them. Any one of these men could preach tonight and they could do a better job at it. But it's just fallen my Lord tonight that I say something. And this is that moment when sometimes the leader has to be led. When you attend a convention, you are under the host pastor. When I look at the clock at the time and I understand the circumstances, The Australian training in me is really groaning. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I've had to put all that aside and say we would do what is done here. Amen. &gt;&gt; The book of Luke chapter 15, we start from verse 11. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. How many are still under expectation tonight? I'm not a long and winding preacher. I usually preach short. And tonight I'm going to preach shorter. But my prayer is that the Lord gives us something tonight. It is good to gather, but it is good when he comes on the scene. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we could just bow our heads for a word of prayer, Lord Jesus, Father, we come tonight and I come the way I am. But Lord, with you all things are possible. I invite you, Father. Anoint thy gift and speak to thy people. Let nothing stand in between. May you break the bread of life in only a way that you can break it. So that as you break it to each individual, may each one of us, have our eyes opened that we may know you in the power of your resurrection. Be thou with us tonight. Give us strength, revelation. May your presence be here. Let everything be done for your glory and your honor. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to obviously bring greetings from the church in Perth. The church is called Spoken Word Fellowship. It is a multinational church. I think the last time we counted the nationalities in terms of origin represented in the church I think we stopped at 14. Amen. So, it's a United Nations. We've got believers from the Philippines. We've got obviously being in Australia, Australians, New Zealand is just across the short sea. So we have New Zealanders as well &gt;&gt; and then we have a lot of believers from Africa, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe, &gt;&gt; DRC, uh I believe there's quite many African people of African origin, but there's one language you speak is the message of the hour. Praise the Lord. Amen. So we approach the word all our flags and everything and places of origin, cultures and traditions go out the window. Praise the Lord. And so I bring greetings from them. Amen. So the book of Luke chapter 15 brings a parable. starting from verse 11 that can only be found in the book of Luke which is the parable of the prodigal son and I think many of you are well acquainted with it and so you are very familiar with the story and I bring I don't attempt to try and bring anything new. You are a well taught people but we will just remind each other of things that are commonly believed amongst us. Praise the Lord. So Luke 15:1 reads, "A certain man had two sons, and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that fleth to me." And he divided unto them his living. And not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living. And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land. And he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country. And he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would have fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat. And no man gave unto him. And when he came to himself, he said, "How many hired servants of my fathers have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger? I will arise and go to my father and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son, make me as one of thy hired servants. And he arose and came to his father. But when he was yet great yet a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. And the son said unto him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son." But the father said to his servants, "Bring forth the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet. and bring heather the feted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry. For this my son was dead and is alive again. He was lost and is found and they began to be merry. May the Lord add blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated. Praise the Lord. And so I look at the theme of this youth convention and it says there the generation of the righteous and obviously it takes inspiration from Psalm chapter 14 verse five. But if you read Psalm chapter 14 to put verse five in context so that you can grasp the full meaning and significance of the portion from which we have taken inspiration. The Bible reads, "The fool had said in his heart, there is no God. They are corrupt. They have done abominable works. There is none that doeth good. How can they be righteous? When they don't know their God, how can they be righteous when they don't have the faith that there is a God? Therefore, they are fools and act like fools because they lack revelation that there is a God. Are we together? So the action of the individual is connected to their revelation of the presence of God. Are we together? And verse two says, "The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men." Notice the Bible says, "God looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek God. Because when you understand who you are, you understand who made this world. You understand your purpose on this earth. You cannot but look for the one who placed you here. Praise the Lord. So the Lord was looking from heaven at the children of men to see if there's any that has understanding and we will seek God. So understanding which is revelation is connected to you seeking the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And the psalm continues, "They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy. There is none that doeth good. No, not one. Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? Who eat up my people as they eat bread? and call not upon the Lord. They were they in great fear, for God is in the generation of the righteous. And then I did a quick Bible search. because I wanted to understand my mind is just quite inquisitive sometimes. So I wanted to understand that word generation. So I searched my Bible to say who are the generation of the righteous? I looked at the word generation in its context, how it is used. And I looked at other Bible verses. Now, I'm not going to go into the Greek and all the other languages, Aramaic and and debate and and and so I'm giving a disclaimer right there. I ain't no Bible proof, but I'm a Bible preacher, but I'm a Bible preacher. &gt;&gt; But I can find good ground to stand on. And that ground is and I think anyone will probably agree with me that the word generation refers to your birth. Are we together? It refers to your birth and it can refer to your birth in two ways. One is the season in which you are born and two is the family or the lineage in which you are born. So you find that the Bible says these are the generations of Abraham. It's not speaking of the time. It's speaking of the lineage from Abraham and his son and his son son AND HIS SON SON. Are we together? So generation in that sense IS REFERRING TO YOUR origin and to your lineage. Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; And then it also refers to the season in which you are born. And the scripture says GOD IS IN the generation of the righteous. Are we together? And we read there in verse two that God looked from heaven upon the children of men to see if there was any that did understand and seek God. And the Bible says they are all gone aside. They have allto together become filthy. There is NONE THAT DOETH GOOD. NO, not one. So there's two CLASSES OF PEOPLE. GOD looks at the children of men and they don't have understanding and they don't seek him and they live filthy and they are separated from him. AT VERSE FIVE INTRODUCES ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE. AND THE BIBLE SAYS GOD IS IN THE GENERATION. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. OF THE RIGHTEOUS. HALLELUJAH. SO THERE IS A PEOPLE SEPARATED FROM GOD. THEY LIVE ACCORDING to the darkness. BUT THERE IS A PEOPLE CONNECTED TO GOD THAT THE BIBLE REFERS to as THE RIGHTEOUS. SO RIGHTEOUSNESS COMES AS A RESULT OF YOUR CONNECTION TO GOD. ARE WE TOGETHER? WITHOUT A CONNECTION TO GOD, THERE IS NO RIGHTEOUSNESS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we read now in Luke chapter 15, the parable of the prodigal son. He was born a son. Amen. AMEN. HE WAS BORN IN THE HOUSE OF THE FATHER. He had a genetic connection to the father. But at a certain point, he decided TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THE FATHER and he asked for WEALTH AND WEALTH DID NOT BRING HIM TO A REALIZATION. THAT HE WAS A SON, HE WAS CONNECTED TO THE FATHER. SO THE PROSPERITY GOSPEL &gt;&gt; CANNOT BRING YOU TO THAT PLACE, NO MATTER WHAT HOUSE YOU LIVE IN, NO MATTER WHAT CAR YOU DRIVE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE IN YOUR ACCOUNT, you can have A LOT OF IT. BUT IT CANNOT BRING YOU TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU REALIZE &gt;&gt; THAT YOU ARE A SON OF THE FATHER THAT YOUR PROSPERITY IS CONNECTED TO YOUR CONNECTION TO THE FATHER. LET ME ALSO CLARIFY IT RIGHT there that THE BIBLE SAYS THAT HE LOST ALL THAT THE FATHER HAD GIVEN HIM AND THE BIBLE MAKES IT PLAIN THAT he beca he came in want. IN OTHER WORDS, HE LOST EVERYTHING AND HE BECAME POOR. HE WAS SO POOR THAT HE had nothing to feed himself with. HE LACKED. ALL the friends left him. THE INFLUENCE JUST GOT DESTROYED AND HE WAS THE POOREST OF THE POOR. AND THE BIBLE IN THIS PARABLE SAYS HE HAD GONE TO A FAR COUNTRY. HE WAS SO SEPARATED FROM THE FATHER THAT THE BIBLE SAYS HE HAD GONE TO A FAR COUNTRY AND HE HAD ASSOCIATED HIMSELF WITH A CITIZEN OF THAT FAR COUNTRY. HE HAD LEFT HIS CONNECTION TO THE FATHER AND WENT FAR AND CONNECTED HIMSELF TO A TO A CITIZEN OF ANOTHER KINGDOM, another civilization, another culture. And you know WHEN YOU DO THAT, THE BIBLE SAYS HE SENT HIM to go and feed this wife. HALLELUJAH. And for a Jew TO GET A JOB TO FEED, YOU CANNOT GET ANY LOWER THAN THAT against any of your convictions. Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S WHERE THE LACK OF REALIZATION CAN TAKE YOU TO. PRAISE THE LORD. SO EXTREME POVERTY still did not bring him to a realization. SO YOU MAY NOT HAVE SHOES. YOU MAY LACK MONEY. YOU MAY NOT HAVE A CAR. YOU MAY NOT HAVE A HOUSE. YOU CAN BE SO POOR. BUT IT DOES NOT MAKE YOU MORE SPIRITUAL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE FAIL TO MAKE IT IN LIFE, then they become super SPIRITUAL AND they don't care about the things OF THE WORLD, THEY ARE NOT connected to the world. AND ALL THE BROTHERS THAT ARE BEING SUCCESSFUL, THEY are all in the flesh. Praise the Lord. BUT AS THE prophet re revisits this story in the message a prodigal, he brings emphasis and he says, "THE ANGEL OF the Lord MUST HAVE GONE TO THIS YOUNG man together." IN OTHER WORDS, NATURAL CIRCUMSTANCES COULD NOT BRING HIM TO THE POINT OF REALIZATION. THERE HAD TO BE A SUPERNATURAL ELEMENT. ARE WE TOGETHER? TO BRING HIM TO THE PLACE WHERE HE COULD REALIZE THAT I DO NOT BELONG HERE. I HAVE A FATHER AND IF I GO BACK TO HIM, I KNOW THE NATURE OF MY FATHER. I KNOW WHO HE IS. I KNOW HIS NATURE. He will ACCEPT ME BACK. OH HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER FROM THAT SUPERNATURAL TOUCH THE BIBLE SAYS HE CAME TO his mind. He was awakened. HIS CONSCIOUSNESS RECEIVED A QUICKENING THAT HE WAS A SON. HE HAD A FATHER AND HE CAME FROM SOMEWHERE AND HE COULD GO BACK WHERE HE CAME FROM. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. A SUPERNATURAL TOUCH QUICKENED HIM TO AN AWARENESS THAT it was a partial realization. WHY DO I SAY SO? BECAUSE HE SAYS IT HIMSELF THAT with all the WRONG that I've DONE with all the CIGARETTES THAT I HAVE SMOKED WITH ALL THE NIGHTCLUBS THAT I HAVE VISITED WITH ALL THE FORNICATION THAT I HAVE DONE WITH ALL THE LIES WITH ALL THE CHEATING WITH ALL THE STEALING THAT I HAVE DONE. &gt;&gt; MY FATHER SHOULD NOT &gt;&gt; ACCEPT ME BACK AS A SON. &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT THE FATHER SAYING IT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT THE FATHER SAYING IT. IT WAS THE SON AND CONDEMNATION compromising his position. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT HE AT LEAST THERE WAS A QUICKENING. EVERY STEP THAT HE WAS MAKING GOING TOWARDS THE FATHER, HE WAS GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE PERFECT REALIZATION. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. AND THE BIBLE SAYS, "AND WHEN HE CAME CLOSE, THE FATHER WAS WAITING FOR HIM." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE FATHER WAS UNDER EXPECTATION. WHY? BECAUSE THERE WAS A GENETIC CONNECTION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THE FATHER KNEW THAT THE GENES IN MY SON CANNOT LET HIM STAY IN DARKNESS ALL HIS LIFE. THE GENES IN HIM WILL CAUSE HIM ONE DAY TO COME TO AN AWAKENING &gt;&gt; AND HE WILL MAKE HIS WAY BACK. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And allow me to say &gt;&gt; the Bible speaks &gt;&gt; of the feted calf. It was not fattened on that day. IT WAS NOT FATTENED ON THAT DAY. IT had been fattened, WAITING FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. AND THE BIBLE SAYS THE FATHER RAN TO MEET HIM AND HE DID NOT GREET HIM AS A STRANGER. HE DID NOT GREET HIM AS A SERVANT. AMEN. YOU DON'T GREET YOUR SERVANT BY KISSING YOUR SERVANT ON THE NECK. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S A PLACE FOR A SON. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE SON COULD HAVE BEEN STILL SMELLING PIGS. HE COULD HAVE BEEN AT THAT TIME WEARING TATTERED CLOTHES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE COULD HAVE BEEN WALKING IN THE STEP THAT HE LAINED IN A STRANGE COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU KNOW HOW THAT IS WITH HIS PANTS RIGHT HERE. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE HE HAD ACQUIRED TASTES AND FLAVORS FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY. AND THE FATHER, SO BEYOND. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO BEYOND THE VISIBLE AND SO THE INVISIBLE, WHAT WAS THE INVISIBLE? THE GENETICS. ARE WE TOGETHER? SO HE NEVER LOST HIS SUNSHIP. &gt;&gt; HE LOST HE LOST HIS RELATIONSHIP TO HIS FATHER. You may sit a bit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The prophet in the message, what is the Holy Ghost? I see the brothers are showing each other that I'm just stealing from their notes. At least now THEY ARE FEELING HOW I was feeling when they were preaching. I saw my sermons finished. So it's it's payback time. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet says in the message, what is the Holy Ghost? He says upon this place we wish to approach the subject which I think is the outstanding subject of today. What is the Holy Spirit? What is it? And now the reason I have taken this subject in this line like this, the prophet says you cannot come and receive the Holy Spirit unless you know what it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? YOU CANNOT TALK and receive righteousness when you don't know what righteousness is. You cannot receive the Holy Ghost when you do not know what the Holy Ghost is. Are we together? Amen. You cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you. And if it's for you, YOU CANNOT KNOW WHETHER YOU'VE GOT it or not unless you know the results which it brings. SO IF YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, WHO it is TO &gt;&gt; AND WHAT ACTION it brings when it comes, then you know what you've got when you get it. See, that just would settle it. If you DON'T KNOW WHAT RIGHTEOUSNESS IS, IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS FOR AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT DOES WHEN IT IS UPON YOU, THEN HOW CAN YOU ENJOY THE FULFILLMENT OF IT? SO WE HAVE TO TEACH WHAT RIGHTEOUSNESS IS. WE HAVE TO TEACH WHAT THE GENERATION OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS. AND WHEN YOU KNOW THAT, YOU NEED ALSO TO KNOW WHO THIS is for. AND THEN YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT WHEN WHEN THIS IS UPON YOU AND YOU HAVE THE RIGHT REVELATION OF IT, THEN WHAT ACTIONS DOES IT BRING? THEN YOU ARE COMPLETE. THEN THE convention is finished. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So we said in the parable of the prodigal son, the son was connected to the blessings as he was as long as he was connected to the father. As long as he had a relationship with the father, he was connected to prosperity, connected to the blessings, connected to the protection, connected to everything that is negative because he was connected to the father. But the day he moved away FROM THE FATHER, then he got disconnected from all this. But it did not remove his position AS A SON. SO WE CAN SAFELY SAY THAT THE ONE thing that he LOST was not HIS SUNSHIP, IT WAS HIS RELATIONSHIP. TO HIS FATHER. &gt;&gt; And if you are to give a title to this subject that I'm about to close now, you say it is called realization of the relationship. Everything is about relationship. A home is ABOUT RELATIONSHIP. You can have a house but not a home. But a home is relationships within a house. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know if that comes out well in your language. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? It is the relationship between the mother and the father and between the parents and the children. And that makes a home. SO A HOME is an interweaving of relationships. Are we together? And a village is also an interweaving of relationships. the village head, his family, the dignitaries in the village, and then ordinary villages. And within that village, there's families that are good at rearing goats. There's villages. There's people who are good at farming. There's people who are GOOD AT GROWING VEGETABLES. THERE'S PEOPLE WHO are good at digging wells. There's big STRONG MEN THAT CAN LIFT heavy things that if people want TO BUILD A HEART AND IT'S NOW TIME TO LIFT THE CENTRAL BEAM, THEY KNOW THE FAMILY THAT has big strong hands. They call FOR THOSE PEOPLE. TO COME AND LIFT THE house or the roof. SO A VILLAGE is interwoven relationships. So is A NATION ALSO. A NATION IS NOT A NATION without relationships. And the nature OF A NATION IS DEFINED BY THE RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE NATION. AND YOU CAN GIVE A NATION TITLES and call it this THAT OR THE OTHER. I HAVE TO tread carefully because it's election time. So I will leave that part. We've been told to apply wisdom. Are we together? &gt;&gt; BUT THE RELATIONSHIP IN THE NATION GIVES CHARACTER TO THE NATION. THAT'S WHY UGANDA IS NOT LIKE RWANDA. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT LIKE TANZANIA. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT LIKE KENYA. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT LIKE ZIMBABWE. IT'S NOT LIKE SOUTH AFRICA. IT'S NOT LIKE AUSTRALIA &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE DIFFERENT institutions the different institutions have different RELATIONSHIPS AND IT IS THOSE RELATIONSHIPS THAT THEN MOLD the character and characteristics of the NATION AND THE BIBLE ITSELF IS A book of relationship. You talk about the story of Ruth and Bo. Hallelujah. You talk about the story OF ESTHER. HALLELUJAH. AND THE KING. YOU TALK ABOUT THE STORIES OF JACOB GOING AFTER HIS WIFE GETTING cheated and getting an older one. But his RELATIONSHIP ALL TO THE YOUNGER ONE WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM WORK AN EXTRA SEVEN YEARS SO that he could still have HER AS A WIFE. ARE WE TOGETHER? It's a book of RELATIONSHIPS AND THE STORY OF REDEMPTION IS THE STORY OF GOD'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS PEOPLE. IN THE MESSAGE, CHRIST IS THE MYSTERY OF GOD REVEALED. THE PROPHET MAKES IT PLAIN THAT GOD HAD A THREE-FOLD PURPOSE IN HIS WHOLE PLAN OF REDEMPTION TO REVEAL HIMSELF to his people in CHRIST AND TO HAVE PREEMINENCE IN THE BODY OF BELIEVERS, THE BRIDE THAT HE MAY LIVE IN THEM. AND THIRDLY, TO RESTORE THE KINGDOM TO ITS RIGHTLY POSITION THAT FELL BY SIN. They had a relationship before. BUT SIN CAME IN AND SIN CAUSED A SEPARATION. SIN AFFECTED THE RELATIONSHIP. ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT THE RELATIONSHIP COULD NOT BE COMPLETELY LOST BECAUSE GOD THE FATHER WAS CONNECTED TO HIS CHILDREN BY GENETICS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. SO HE HAD TO MAKE A WAY OF COMING BACK FOR HIS OWN CHILDREN BECAUSE A SON AND A DAUGHTER OF GOD CANNOT BE completely lost. And where was he restoring them to? To a place &gt;&gt; where he walked in the cool of the evening. with his people, talked with them, fellowshipped with them. And the prophet says, "What is fellowship?" And the prophet says, "It is two fellows IN ONE SHIP. GOD ALONE WITH HIS CHILDREN." THAT'S THE PLACE THAT GOD WANTS TO TAKE YOU TO TAKE ME TO TAKE THE WHOLE BRIDE BACK TO WHERE GOD CAN TALK TO US AS FRIEND TO FRIEND WITH perfect trust PERFECT REVELATION THAT THIS IS MY FATHER, THIS IS MY SON. WE LOVE EACH OTHER. WE TRUST EACH OTHER. I WILL GIVE MY SON THE AUTHORITY TO SPEAK AND TO NAME AND TO DEFINE BECAUSE HE IS MY SON. AND GOD ALL THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAS BEEN WORKING HIS PLAN TO BRING THE BRIDE BACK TO THAT PLACE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IN THE MESSAGE, THE deity of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; the prophet says, "Men lost the origin in the garden of Eden, his relationship, COMMUNION WITH GOD WAS CUT OFF THERE BECAUSE of sin AND UNBELIEF. UNBELIEF IN WHAT? The word OF GOD. IN A MESSAGE, a testimony, THE PROPHET SAYS, "THERE'S ONE MEDIATOR BETWEEN God and man, AND THAT'S THE MAN, JESUS CHRIST." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE ONE WHO DIED TO BRING THE RELATIONSHIP. that was ONCE LOST BETWEEN GOD AND MAN BACK AGAIN. &gt;&gt; HE IS OUR PROVIDED SACRIFICE FOR OUR SICKNESS FOR OUR SALVATION. HE WAS WOUNDED for our TRANSGRESSIONS AND WITH HIS STRIPES WE ARE HEALED. AMEN. SO WHAT DID WE LOSE? IT WAS NEVER our sunship. It was never our spiritual DNA. WE CAME FROM GOD. WE HAVE THE GENES OF GOD. WE ARE THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. BUT WHAT DID WE LOSE? WE LOST OUR RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE YOUR BLESSINGS. YOUR PROSPERITY, YOUR VICTORY IS CONNECTED TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP. When you lose YOUR RELATIONSHIP, YOU ARE DISCONNECTED FROM YOUR BLESSINGS. YOU ARE DISCONNECTED FROM YOUR AUTHORITY BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO POWER OF YOUR OWN. BUT WHAT YOU HAVE IS AUTHORITY. AND HOW DO YOU HAVE AUTHORITY? BECAUSE YOU ARE A SON OF THE FATHER. AND ALL THAT THE FATHER HAS HE HAS GIVEN TO THE SON. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AND ALL THAT THE SON HAD &gt;&gt; HE HAS POURED INTO THE CHURCH. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT IS THIS MESSAGE? Matthew chapter 17 verse 10. The disciples asked him, SAYING, "WHY THEN SAY THE scribes that Elias must first come? All these things that you have said, it's clear. We see this BUT WE EXPECTED BEFORE YOUR COMING THAT ELIAS SHOULD FIRST COME. WHY DID THE SCRIBES TELL US THAT ELIAS MUST FIRST COME? VERSE 11. And Jesus answered and said unto them, &gt;&gt; ELIAS TRULY SHALL FIRST COME. NOW LET ME ASK YOU BROTHER, SISTER, THE WORD IS CLEAR. JESUS CHRIST THE WORD MADE FLESH IS GIVING AN ANSWER THAT ELIAS MUST SHALL FIRST COME TO DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; TO DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
