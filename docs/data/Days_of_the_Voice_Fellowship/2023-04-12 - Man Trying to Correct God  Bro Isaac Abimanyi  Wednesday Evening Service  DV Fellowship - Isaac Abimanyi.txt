and the Lord had it now the man Moses was very Meek above all the men which were upon the faith of the face of the Earth and the Lord spoke suddenly unto Moses and unto Elon and unto Miriam come out ye three unto the Tabernacle of the congregation and then Theory came out and the Lord came down in the pit of cloud and stood in the door of the tabernac and called Elon and Miriam and they both came forth and he said here now my words if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in dream foreign [Music] foreign let us also go in the Book of Romans chapter 8 verse 28 from verse 28. it says and we know that all things work together for good unto them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose [Music] because this is not a safe place for you to stay foreign and receive greetings from uh from my wife um so much to be in this place today she was caught she has been she has been caught by work and she had to go and pick the kids so there is no way we could fix it but I believe seeing me as a person but I know she's standing at my side praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ so uh without taking time today we are going to take a subject a little subject to The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ may God bless him so much you know it is not easy for someone to give you his PowerPoint when someone gives you indeed that is the grace of God praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ by your prayers God is going to use me today this evening for you this evening now we are going to talk about a little subject called man correcting God together foreign I'm taking the inspiration from this scripture we have read of numbers and we are going to talk about Moses we are going to talk about his sister called Miriam again we talk about his brother called Ellen said praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus [Music] [Music] during the time when he was born where [Applause] [Applause] in the uh in the Palace of uh the fellows by God is Grace I don't want to speak everything you'll go there and read Exodus chapter 2 chapter 1 and chapter two numbers but just to give you a little background of what we want to talk about this evening praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ so Moses was called by God he grew up in the hands of his mother in an indirect way [Music] praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ this child telling him we are born for a purpose we are born to redeem Israel hallelujah amen so that is what Moses knew about because when you read in chapter one hallelujah amen actually chapter two the first one that is where the story is found Moses his mother had to put him on a certain liver to spare him from the persecution of Jesus Christ that is why that is a daughter fellow came and picked this Moses and owned him and took him in the Paris Hallelujah man but then she had because she had no blessed to Bliss feed him she had no mirror to breastfeed what she did she had to find a certain woman who had lost a baby because I told you they were killing the little boys by that time so she wanted to [Applause] praise God he was a place and he was expected to be the next Fellowship he had got training of the the trainings of the Egyptians and he was well equipped but he was told by his mom that you are not an Egyptian you are an Israelite one for a purpose so one day as Moses was walking and he found he phoned an Egyptian now saying to fight with an Israelites because inside him he knew he was a redeemer and he had hopes that maybe he can start his Redemption plan or maybe he can start redeeming his rights from that time what he did the Egyptians to serve the Israelites Hallelujah but the Bible says when the news reached reached fellow um Musa and Moses had to take over to took off the Wilderness for his life praise the one of the name of Jesus Christ [Applause] when he reached the Wilderness he reached to a certain man in his place called praise God we will go and read the entire story from chapter 2. to bring out my the background Hallelujah man praise God and when he reached there he was so uh welcomed in this home [Applause] [Applause] Hallelujah yeah he had a son called Isaac from Isaac from isaka came the twins yes of Jacob and Esau and from Jacob who succeeded there came the trail of tribes Hallelujah man and they shifted never gained and they went to Egypt because of feminine praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ that is when they entered a Strange Land as it was taught to Abraham by God in Genesis chapter 15 verse 13. [Music] [Applause] [Applause] in Egypt [Applause] [Music] praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ foreign [Music] wanted to kill Moses the moment he could see him and when it reached Moses we had to come Moses he had to take off Wilderness for his life praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ those were 390 years of Israel are in Egypt they were Not Mere citizens they were meant to be slaves doing the hard Works The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ so they were ever crying to God out and redeem them as he had promised to Abraham Hallelujah man praise God at the age of 40. Moses enter the [Applause] and then he spent in the wilderness 40 other years praise God when God was training him when he was getting out of him the trainings he had received from Egypt all the wisdom he had obtained from Egypt the Lord was bringing it out of him and now the Lord was training him his way he was imparting in him his wisdom praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ [Applause] that is when God came and visited Moses when he was looking after the flock of his uh father-in-law [Music] that is the one of the name of Jesus Christ [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] there 40 years [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] he had killed an Egyptian the ears of the fellows Hallelujah and Moses had grew with the fellowship [Music] knew very well who was fellows hallelujah amen praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ now Moses feared to go back in Egypt he started to give excuses my Lord I cannot speaks Hallelujah you are the person I chose Hallelujah you have to go in any way Hallelujah man and then God commissioned him to go in Egypt Hallelujah but there are so many holy men by then oh I mean by then [Applause] [Applause] Hallelujah man you know all of us God created us with a specific purpose in life Hallelujah we are created to place some Lords in this life Hallelujah to add something unto the blood of Christ Hallelujah man and the reason of your birth might not be the reason of my birth foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you could not find in any man in Moses to be so humble because in Egypt Moses grew up as a place and he knew it was the next fellow and all Egypt knew that Moses was next God they had to take him in the wilderness in him hallelujah amen hallelujah amen and it is the same way why we are here on Earth [Applause] God is creating his Godly characters hello [Applause] hallelujah praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ so no one could take the place of Moses Hallelujah because Moses had to be trained in the wilderness had to be molded and no man was murdered like Moses Meek like Moses no man was humble like Moses Hallelujah man praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ after giving excuses and then God persisted insisted on him and told him you have to go in here Egypt hallelujah amen and when he reached there he performed with whatever God told him to perform finally got him out hallelujah amen and then they eat they entered the Wilderness where once Moses was for 40 years now the children of Israel Israeli entered the Wilderness and when they entered the Wilderness that is when the troubles started Hallelujah in Egypt in this city they were slaves [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign Hallelujah man now they uploaded ready for them Hallelujah as they wanted to approach it Hallelujah man when they looked behind imagine because their minds wanted to go back in Egypt because they thought they had to cross this uh they had to to uh to go into this water and maybe swim battles because they were there were no ships ever you can think of they could travel by on water so their minds now I wanted to go back in Egypt Hallelujah things he now start to become worse and when they looked behind America Hallelujah thinking of going back they show fellow coming with his chariots first of Egypt was coming after them now they wanted to go into the waters yesterday when they looked on the other side maybe to free to the other side the Bible says not free from that side maybe they say that that's free from when they look there Hallelujah there was also a high look high mountain and they were in between there influence is the Red Sea and the high end is the enemy coming after them in the sides a high mountains they started crying now what did you brought us in this wilderness because there wasn't enough food in Egypt they started to murmur against Moses started to revile at Moses Hallelujah but Moses was so Meek he was so humble why because of the training he had in the wilderness praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ whenever they could revile against Moses Hallelujah Moses could look at the Lord called upon the name of the Lord come and he called upon the Lord the Lord could provide a solution Hallelujah that is when the Lord told him don't to cry but to speak he told Moses not to cry but to speak hallelujah praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ and that is when the world was created [Applause] Hallelujah and as the Egyptians were following them Hallelujah as they reach the reddish even entered the Regency to to maybe to get the Israelites then the Bible says the Lord destroyed the whole house I want you to listen very well Hallelujah now after there after crossing the Bible says they went singing they went to rejoicing saying oh these are good you know this is so good she's a provider that is when the Bible says Moses she's a sister she picked up a tumbling and then she started singing other sisters into singing [Applause] our lord is good our Lord is a provider how this work is going to be so simple now we are seeing you hallelujah praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ they traveled Unleashed a place where the water was so Source Hallelujah and we are thirsty Hallelujah and when they reach that place having bitter Waters they wanted something to drink Hallelujah and they turned against Moses and Moses of the training in the foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] who founded favor before the Egypt the Israelites Hallelujah and the other party was the people who came as a result of inter-marriages between the Israelites and Egyptians so it was a mixed multitude some of them even never knew about the God of Moses they could speak bitter bitterly to Moses could do was keep silence was to Humble himself and the Lord could provide a solution Hallelujah man now to bring you back to Elon and Miriam [Applause] the traveling process the genuine processed the Bible says she was a prophetess Hallelujah they were all from they were all favored before God hallelujah man praise God God could visit them he could visit Hallelujah through dreams Hallelujah and he could visit Visions [Applause] was God is prophet and we know very well a prophet is a mouthpiece of God the Bible says Moses Eye to Eye could speak mouth to mouth Hallelujah so Moses was a holy man was God his chosen man yeah [Applause] [Applause] it means God could first go to Moses and then Moses could bring the information to the children of Israel could speak to Moses Eye to Eye Hallelujah face to face hallelujah hallelujah man praise God hallelujah now let us get in the Numbers Chapter 12 where we started from that has been the background I've been giving such as you understand this evening foreign [Music] [Music] Hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] event was called the tent of congregation [Music] that is the tent where they could uh worship God from uh Hallelujah man and that tent had three divisions the first place was to cut the holy place and then the holy of holies so there was a tent that was separating the first place to the holy place [Applause] yes and the holy place now let me assume this is the first place Hallelujah man now here was a big cutting cutting that was separating this first place with this next place called The Holy place and when they it reached [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] because it was a holy place for God for we know God is Holy that is why we are saying Moses was a holy man hallelujah praise God and when Moses died sorry the high priests are performed on that law of Moses himself enter into the Hall of holies God speak to him Hallelujah he could enter when he's having even elope a long Lopez having Bells every day the moment they could spend their days without maybe coming back [Applause] Hallelujah he understood all is he still alive yeah the moment he went there when he had not cleansed himself to die from there that only of holies Hallelujah they could understand this man maybe he's dead themselves [Applause] so in other words it was a holiest place Hallelujah man but by then it was only Moses that could go there again Hallelujah man praise God now when we go when we uh when we get into chapter 12 of numbers here they were still in the wilderness traveling to the promise Hallelujah because they spent in the wilderness for 40 years you can just imagine and before even that is according to the pro to the map Egypt was somewhere here hallelujah hallelujah Egypt was somewhere here and then the promised land was somewhere here they could take for some few days not even three weeks but because God saw their hearts what did he do instead of letting them just cross over for 14 days 13 days [Applause] rotating better already Hallelujah for 40 years such that he might get out the hardiness out of their hearts [Applause] [Applause] just to bring us here on Earth it would be easy for God to bring us here on Earth they will spend like one week to my whole weekend Hallelujah and then we go back home today hallelujah amen he has to hear to take us through this Wilderness for years and years take away the hardiness of the hearts to take away all the unbelief out of us hallelujah man so that's why I tell you we are here for a certain impact what you have to do is to identify that purpose then you live according to that purpose knowing in your heart Second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 10 says one day you're going to stand before the Lord and then give an accountant is on you can put foreign [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Applause] Hallelujah yes it says we are going to come back for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body Buddhism whether it be good or bad Hallelujah just keep that in your mind we have to fail to appear before the Lord One Day by that day we shall be giving an accountability the purpose so it depends whether you serve the purpose or you reject and then you will have to give an accountability Hallelujah so I was telling you now we are in numbers 12. Hallelujah [Applause] yeah Numbers Chapter 12. I want to rush we are remaining with very few minutes chapter 12 is they reached somewhere whatever after all the marmalings that Moses received from the children of Israel Israel Hallelujah then even the people that could stand along with him he is his sister his brother maganda way one of the same mother and father he started also to travel him he started to criticize him Hallelujah this man of God this is Pastor Moses Hallelujah the two the two ministers started criticizing him again and when they crossed the Red Sea the other women into singing and they were singing We are serving the lord Hallelujah but Hallelujah are we together to defend they just now go to let us follow on as we are reading together Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married so he had married an Ethiopian woman they just stopped there for a little while don't put it off now as I told you when Moses free uh freed in the wilderness and he was good to that man again yes and that man gave him his daughter called The Zipper your name who was a black woman who was an Ethiopian Hallelujah man and now okay uh they had a child called praise God and when God met Moses during that experience of the burning bush in the wilderness and then he told him to go in Egypt Moses had to go with his wife and his son to go in there in Egypt deliver the children of Israel but the name is but as they were traveling again I want you to notice something very important here hallelujah man there is something I want to bring to your attention Hallelujah man as they were traveling praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ and the Lord wanted to kill Moses imagine the man he called [Applause] it was a physical Church we are typing a spiritual church that was coming we are the spiritual church are you getting it Hallelujah we are the physical children of God and we are the spiritual they were Israelites in physical and we are the Israelites spirituality Hallelujah so now uh are they alive whatever they went through your neighbor item is never to go by the ways they went today that's why we are reading that Old Testament again now it says and it came to pass by the way that the Lord met him and sought to kill him Hallelujah man then zipporah took a sharp Stone and cut off the foreskin over her son I was put on natural ginger salad and he cast it at his feet and he said surely a bloody husband at thou to me so he let him go America then she said a bloody husband Thou Art because of the circumcision Hallelujah man now when God made Abraham Ibrahim he made a covenant with Abraham Hallelujah man he made a covenant with Abraham and then told him that whenever you will have a son when he makes seven days was it seven I [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] so now Moses was also a Jew but now here he had he he had a son but this son had yet not God circumcised and yet God had made a covenant with Abraham so when as God was looking at Moses he was looking at a disobedient person because God doesn't change with his wife in his word or his work his word is ever true when he says that is all sufficient no one can change it Hallelujah so God wanted to kill Moses are disobeyed in other words to circumcise the little boys Hallelujah but then this you woman who was despised a Baraka woman Ethiopian woman gave him yes in the wilderness [Applause] that if you don't circumcise this boy your husband is going to be killed again Hallelujah Moses was saved because of the revelation of zipporah he put a sharp Stone and circumcised the boy Hallelujah man are you seeing how people how what people call the mistake salvation to Moses because surely the Lord was going to kill Moses if it wasn't for zippers Hallelujah now let us proceed in the numbers fear of category today Hallelujah man are you getting something Hallelujah man they're just going numbers fell off where I started from today hallelujah amen are you there and the Miriam speak against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman some translations you say is a colored woman Hallelujah man praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ as you know Ethiopians [Music] so now they talked against Moses because of this woman and they say they hash the Lord indeed is spoken only by Moses now even they started doubting goddess I mean Moses Ministry he started doubting the pastor's Ministry Pastor Moses Hallelujah this was his brother and his sister now the man was very Meek um they are talking about Moses now now the man Moses was very Meek um which way upon the face of the earth now where did he go to this meekness from in the desert experience for the 40 years is spinning the Wilderness that is where I got it is hallelujah some of us we fear the Wilderness We Fear The Temptations and trials Hallelujah We Fear the troubles that is where we all we have to get our experience from that is where we can get our harmonies motif [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] than any other man in this Earth because of that experience which Miriam and Aaron had known [Music] and the Lord respect suddenly unto Moses of the congregation [Music] of the congregation is the other thing I told you end of the congregation a special tent where they could go for worship and the Lord called them out and Moses Hallelujah now God was going to make me foreign [Applause] are you getting me together are you following verse 5 and the Lord came down in the pit of of the cloud it means it was during the daytime because a cloud could lead them during that time then at night it was a pillow and then the Lord came in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the Tabernacle um if there be a prophet among you um the Lord will speak my soul how I the Lord will make myself known unto him and will speak unto him in a dream so the Lord was speaking to Elon and Miriam through vision and dreams and he said if you are prophet in other words I'll I speak to you in dreams and visions and then verse 7 says my servant Moses is known so now God was introducing his judgments Hallelujah with him will I speak mouth to mouth even apparently and anointing dark speeches and the similitude of the Lord shall be behold shall he behold then where are you not afraid to speak against myself Hallelujah now we are talking about the things of church the church of Moses [Applause] [Music] departed from maybe some of you have never got an opportunity to see one of them because the days we are living in there are so many Medical Solutions to such problems he has white white things the same way has called it amen hallelujah man so and in Egypt I mean in Israeli God had commanded that energy any leper was to be in their Middle East Hallelujah and they could be taken out of the tent Because of You Hallelujah man that is the command that God gave them one who could stay in Israel I mean in their Middle East when he was when you go in the book of you are you're going to bring me back eh brother you're going to bring me back going Numbers Chapter 5 Verse Hallelujah man I'm trying to finish up something Hallelujah man Numbers chapter five chapter five from verse 1. you're going to see something a repressed person was not supposed to be in their Middle East don't touch them the Lord told them Hallelujah they should be taken out now here here we are here verse chapter 5 verse 1 and the Lord is back unto Moses command the children of Israeli that they put out all the camp every leper but generally and everyone that has an issue yes and whosoever is and whosoever is defiled by the dead is defined by the dead both male and female he put out I was said without the camp shall he put them they defiled not their camps in the ministry Hallelujah because God could come as I told you the tent of congregation was in their midis inside the Temple of congregation there was the ark of the convenience was a seat of the Lord that Ark of the Covenant is where the the tablets of laws were kept cutting themselves foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah man and the cloud departed from off the tablet and behold medium became Liberace and Elon looked upon me now beholders TV [Music] she was almost dead of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb um and Moses the one they talked against verse 13 says Moses Cried unto the Lord now the person they talked against Christ [Music] the pastor now pleading for the congregation Hallelujah when you go in the book you will not go there but you write it when you're going in the book of Exodus chapter 32 Hallelujah time came and God wanted to destroy the entire nation of Israel [Applause] in the gap no and he said if you want to kill them now first come against me Hallelujah man praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and the god despair to them because of Moses is his sake whom they were now talking against that was the meekness of Moses Hallelujah man hey that was Moses because of the Wilderness experience Hallelujah and the Lord and the Lord said unto Moses I have seen these people and behold it is stiff-necking people now they are for letting me alone that my wrath May Works hot against them and that I may consume them and I'll make of thee a great nation now the person they talked against [Applause] [Music] and the Lord said unto Moses if her if her father at the pool had heard but spit in her face should should she not be ashamed even uh Hashem the seven days you can read um let her be shut out from the camp seven days and after that let her be received in again was shot out from the camp seven days and the people Janet known till Miriam was brought in again Hallelujah man so because of this liprised case Miriam was closed outside the camp Miriam we are supposed to travel by that time I go to another place but because of this situation they charity for other 70 days when she was outside remember she was an example of a person she tried to advise God in other words that the wife you gave to Moses Hallelujah in other words she was trying to advise God because we saw that God gave our Moses this wife for a purpose and we saw today if it wasn't for this woman Hallelujah man so that is what we started with in Romans chapter 8 verse 28. all things worketh together for goodness Hallelujah when you see something is lacking with that passion the best thing you can do is to pray for him Hallelujah otherwise criticizing might cause problems to you later it might bring lip process to you it is not going to be a physically plus the way it was to Miriam but this time it is going to be a spiritually because they told you God foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] yeah maybe maybe you wanted to mean this is hallelujah and in that they are they are getting together they are bringing a cast to themselves upon themselves I mean Hallelujah when someone makes a mistake in a church they tend to criticize him hallelujah praise God when a pastor does something wrong because they criticize when any Minister make something wrong but just get to know your way if you do search Hallelujah because I told you Israel is our mirror is hallelujah I think you know that so whichever they went through the very same things we are going through but Hallelujah Hallelujah man so God requires you if you see anything wrong again I mean about a pastor or any of your brothers just put him in prayer commit to God In Prayer instead of criticizing that person Hallelujah instead of reviling Hallelujah just put it in prayer that is the meekness that the Lord wants in us the humble is he wants in us that to an extent that when some person does something wrong to you you just commit him in prayer if they are deployed because they were spiritual people the other one was a hype list and minimum was a prophet Moses to this woman [Music] foreign by to bring to you more troubles more than you think that's why you see many people are under bondage today asking why people are watching because of the little things they think that are little even before God bite others to discuss the pasta to discuss the church Hallelujah it is better we take examples of them because whichever happened to them was our example was our examples you might take them never to error in the same way Hallelujah man let me read this quotas I'm winding up in a message as I was with Moses in 1960 September 11th it says hallelujah hallelujah he says now no matter what Moses done it was Moses's office that God respected yes it was really more than a prophet yeah it was more than any Prophet they had yeah when his own sister laughed at him for marrying an Ethiopian girl called them together and he said don't you fear God hallelujah man see that's not a good thing to Trump upon goddess people you hurt him when you do so God had commissioned Moses he's very has made nothing [Music] Hallelujah so this person you're criticizing knows his weakness he knows your weakness so better commit it to God In Prayer [Music] Hallelujah man praise God in the message respects [Music] [Music] do what they want to let the world do what they want to um Hallelujah man foreign she directly proced that does not come to you because the Lord doesn't change what he did then he's going to do it even now Hallelujah is the same God hallelujah you just go down pray for that person Miriam had prayed over that matter she wouldn't have came on her Channel they just take these examples the Bible says they were given for and for our inside Hallelujah man
