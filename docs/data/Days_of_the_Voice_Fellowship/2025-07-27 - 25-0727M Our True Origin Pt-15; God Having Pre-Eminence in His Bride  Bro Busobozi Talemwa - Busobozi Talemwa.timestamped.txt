[57:12] &gt;&gt; that you may be known
[57:16] in our lives.
[57:19] the Lord. It will come to that moment,
[57:21] that place
[57:24] where everything else will fade away
[57:29] where we will no longer see ourselves,
[57:33] but we will see you,
[57:37] where we no longer see our brothers and
[57:40] our sisters.
[57:43] Lord, if we look at one another,
[57:46] we are so full of imperfection.
[57:50] We are so full of bad things.
[57:54] Oh God,
[57:57] when we look at you
[57:59] is all about Christ.
[58:02] Then we can see God in our
[58:06] see God in our system
[58:09] and all the other things do not matter
[58:12] because in your presence
[58:15] there is fullness of
[58:17] Lord Jesus take all my brothers
[58:22] and sisters
[58:24] that have come here today
[58:26] Lord may you oh God take them away
[58:30] they will cease to be seen
[58:34] Even they will cease to see themselves
[58:37] that you
[58:39] may be seen.
[58:42] Be seen in our worship.
[58:44] Be seen Lord as we hear the word.
[58:48] May it reveal Lord
[58:51] this mystery to us
[58:53] of what it is that you have done
[58:56] in this house.
[58:59] Somebody may say, "Lord, I feel dry."
[59:04] Doesn't matter how they feel.
[59:07] Your word is here
[59:10] to revive the dry,
[59:13] to revive the sinner,
[59:15] to heal the sick.
[59:18] Amen. You are here, Lord. and you're
[59:20] going to speak to us through your word
[59:23] to do the mighty works, the mighty
[59:26] miracles
[59:27] in our ministry.
[59:29] Father, we commit this service,
[59:32] the preaching of your word,
[59:35] however short it is, Father,
[59:38] Father, may we see you.

[59:44] may see you Lord.
[59:47] granted father

[1:00:23] He told me he called me said he's in
[1:00:25] Hindi.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; So try to connect him the believers
[1:00:30] there
[1:00:32] and he's working there. So if you go
[1:00:34] working in a place
[1:00:37] always get in touch with us so we can
[1:00:38] connect you with the church.
[1:00:42] believer has to go to church
[1:00:44] every service. We have our two visitors
[1:00:47] that have not been welcome.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Can you raise up your
[1:00:59] God bless you? Welcome.
[1:01:04] God bless you, brother Henry.
[1:01:07] God bless you so much.
[1:01:09] And before we go to the word,
[1:01:12] I just wanted to say sister Susan called
[1:01:13] me the other day
[1:01:16] and told me the gentleman that gave us
[1:01:18] the contact of the owner of the land
[1:01:24] um you know called her and said well you
[1:01:27] did not ask for money and he gave me
[1:01:29] little money
[1:01:35] so I want you to team up with me we go
[1:01:37] to the sale of the land we say that we
[1:01:38] want all both of us to be paid
[1:01:46] So that uh they can also give you and
[1:01:48] also we the increase at least 5
[1:01:50] millions.
[1:01:52] And the sister went
[1:01:55] to with the owner of the land and all
[1:01:57] this.
[1:01:59] And she said to them, "Uh, no me. Uh,
[1:02:02] this is my church.
[1:02:05] Yes, I directed the church there,
[1:02:09] but not to be paid.
[1:02:11] because we are we are the ones
[1:02:12] collecting the money
[1:02:15] to buy the land. So I cannot be paid
[1:02:19] and uh you know I I think we need we we
[1:02:22] she deserves to you know be thanked for
[1:02:24] that
[1:02:28] sister Susan. God bless you for that
[1:02:31] knowing that this you're not doing this
[1:02:32] for me
[1:02:34] any individual here but for the sake of
[1:02:37] the work of God.
[1:02:39] Amen.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; We are only stewards.
[1:02:44] A pastor is a steward.
[1:02:47] You are stewards of the word that God
[1:02:49] has given.
[1:02:51] But we don't own anything.
[1:02:54] Even the land we are going to buy.
[1:02:57] None of us is going to own it.
[1:03:00] The church is going to own it. And and
[1:03:03] because we we we believe it's not only
[1:03:05] for us who are here.
[1:03:08] If the Lord tries
[1:03:11] for our children, for their children,
[1:03:14] our children,
[1:03:16] if the Lord tries, but if he comes
[1:03:18] quick,
[1:03:20] well, we don't care what happens to
[1:03:23] praise the name of God.
[1:03:25] Amen.
[1:03:27] Shall we stand up on our feet and still
[1:03:29] standing sitting? We reading in
[1:03:32] Colossians chapter 1 26.
[1:03:37] Brother, brother Baka, you always
[1:03:40] surprise me when I don't expect you and
[1:03:41] then I
[1:03:44] bless you so much. I'm always happy to
[1:03:45] see you, too.
[1:03:48] Amen. Amen.
[1:03:52] Uh Colossians
[1:03:59] chapter 1 vers 26.
[1:04:03] [Music]
[1:04:38] If you're there, say amen.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:48] I was just around it. But this is a new
[1:04:50] Bible and I was wondering
[1:04:56] it was just stuck in these pages.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Chapter 1 vers 26.
[1:05:05] Um we could actually begin from up but
[1:05:07] uh
[1:05:09] for the for our reading let's just read
[1:05:12] from
[1:05:15] even the mystery which has been heed
[1:05:18] from ages and from generations but now
[1:05:20] is made manifest to his saints
[1:05:24] to whom God would make known what's the
[1:05:26] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:05:28] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[1:05:30] you the hope of glory whom we preach
[1:05:33] warning every man and teaching every man
[1:05:35] in in all wisdom, that we may present
[1:05:37] every man perfect in Christ Jesus, where
[1:05:39] unto I also labor striving according to
[1:05:41] his working, which workketh in me
[1:05:43] mighty.
[1:05:54] Fore!
[1:06:13] [Music]
[1:06:15] Foreign! Foreign!
[1:06:18] [Music]
[1:06:38] Amen. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. May
[1:06:42] God bless the reading of his word.
[1:06:51] I see some of us are making it a trend
[1:06:55] to be to be late.
[1:07:03] Just for a reminder
[1:07:05] here at DVF, we really try to keep time.
[1:07:11] We are not yet there, but we try our
[1:07:12] best.
[1:07:14] The service begins 10 sharp.
[1:07:19] But you know, you notice if you the
[1:07:22] majority are late,
[1:07:26] then somehow the service is a bit
[1:07:27] dragged and
[1:07:32] it's not a good thing.
[1:07:35] So the song leader is always here. Uh
[1:07:38] the musicians are always here 30 minutes
[1:07:40] before.
[1:07:44] at exactly 10 the service.
[1:07:48] So whether you are late or not,
[1:07:50] the service will not wait for you. But
[1:07:53] if you come late, you will not be in the
[1:07:57] spirit of the service.
[1:07:58] [Music]
[1:08:00] Somehow you you will not enjoy the
[1:08:02] service.
[1:08:04] Try to always try make it a culture
[1:08:09] that you always come 30 minutes before
[1:08:11] 10
[1:08:14] and come and be here in silent prayers.
[1:08:19] You read the word, you meditate.
[1:08:22] When the song leader begins,
[1:08:25] before even the word, you already
[1:08:28] feeling blessed.
[1:08:31] And uh by one, I mean we'll we go
[1:08:36] after everything.
[1:08:38] I I feel that that can be edifying.
[1:08:43] I don't believe in dragging a service
[1:08:47] 3 four hours.
[1:08:49] You see, but we need to be in the same
[1:08:51] spirit
[1:08:53] when we do that.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen if we agree with you?
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Um, so brother Isaac, I'm still
[1:09:02] continuing. But today we are speaking on
[1:09:05] God having preeminence in his bride.
[1:09:16] So really our subject or our our title
[1:09:19] is our true origin.
[1:09:25] But um I mean you can finish a year on
[1:09:29] that.
[1:09:31] I don't have to remind you that every
[1:09:32] service
[1:09:34] but every service we really have a
[1:09:36] subject that
[1:09:39] so today we are speaking on God having
[1:09:41] preeminence in his bride.
[1:09:47] God having
[1:09:50] God having preeminence in his bride.
[1:09:58] Yeah. these things, you know, when you
[1:09:59] mess up one word, it's all gone.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You clap for our brother here.
[1:10:09] Clap for him. God bless you.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's a lot of things
[1:10:16] and uh and um just if you give me your
[1:10:19] undivided attention
[1:10:23] and um you will help me preach
[1:10:26] then I'm sure within a short time the
[1:10:28] Lord will speak to you
[1:10:31] and then we can have a short quick work
[1:10:32] this morning
[1:10:35] and then off you go and we worship and
[1:10:38] then you go.
[1:10:41] Amen. How many love the word of God?
[1:10:45] Amen. You know, I've I've seen that the
[1:10:47] bride loves the word.
[1:10:50] The bride loves the world.
[1:10:53] Amen. No matter which color, no matter
[1:10:54] which race,
[1:10:57] no matter where you are from.
[1:10:59] Listen, I've traveled around the world
[1:11:02] and I've seen one thing. And the bride
[1:11:06] loves the world
[1:11:08] more than anything else. And that's what
[1:11:11] makes us different from the the rest of
[1:11:13] the world.
[1:11:16] So now we see what I'm sharing on today
[1:11:21] is like what I can call the main purpose
[1:11:25] of the message.
[1:11:27] [Music]
[1:11:30] The main purpose of the message
[1:11:33] like we are talking about God resto
[1:11:35] restoring the relationship between God
[1:11:37] and man.
[1:11:41] When that relationship between God and
[1:11:44] man is restored,
[1:11:48] then God is going to have preeminence
[1:11:54] in that man
[1:11:57] whose relationship with God has been
[1:12:00] restored.
[1:12:03] Because you see that man has already
[1:12:05] found out where he came from.
[1:12:09] That man has already recognized his true
[1:12:12] identity.
[1:12:15] And therefore, it's no longer him.
[1:12:18] It's no longer about him.
[1:12:22] It's all about God.
[1:12:27] How many have ever listened to the
[1:12:28] message titled, "Why are we not a
[1:12:31] denomination?"
[1:12:36] Okay. Most of the majority have not go
[1:12:39] back at home and listen to that.
[1:12:44] It is the one of the very first I
[1:12:46] listened to
[1:12:48] when I came to the message and it's a
[1:12:49] very good message.
[1:12:51] I wanted to understand why are they
[1:12:54] always saying they are not a
[1:12:55] denominator.
[1:12:57] They saying they message believers
[1:13:00] and they are not Catholics. They not
[1:13:02] Anglicans Pentecostals and they are not
[1:13:04] Adventists. So what are they? So I
[1:13:08] wanted to know that's why I want to
[1:13:10] listen to that message.
[1:13:12] And um so when you you you'll understand
[1:13:17] when you you talk about God having
[1:13:19] preeminence in his bride,
[1:13:23] you will understand why we are not a
[1:13:26] denomination.
[1:13:30] You will understand who we are.
[1:13:34] What we are representing.
[1:13:38] May God help you to understand.
[1:13:41] Amen.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, are you following me?
[1:13:43] May God help you to understand.
[1:13:46] Praise the name of the Lord. We have
[1:13:49] many big denominations
[1:13:53] but the purpose of God
[1:13:56] has never been to start any.
[1:14:00] God has never started any denomination.
[1:14:06] Denominations were started by man.
[1:14:10] And when Jesus came on earth,
[1:14:13] he came only for one purpose
[1:14:17] to bridge the gap between man and God
[1:14:24] to remove that gap
[1:14:26] whereby all those that were in the mind
[1:14:29] of God
[1:14:32] were now lost.
[1:14:35] lost in his sin,
[1:14:38] you know, uh can be restored.
[1:14:43] Now when they restored,
[1:14:46] he can now be again seen in them.
[1:14:52] Do you know when we are born,
[1:14:58] God cannot be seen in us?
[1:15:03] Think about the things you do.
[1:15:07] Think about the things you did
[1:15:09] before you received the Holy Spirit.
[1:15:12] Think about your life. And now ask
[1:15:15] yourself a question. How did it glorify
[1:15:18] God?
[1:15:22] It did not glorify God.
[1:15:25] Going to a disco club does not glorify
[1:15:26] God.
[1:15:28] Going to drink does not glorify God.
[1:15:32] going to do this and other glorify God
[1:15:35] going to pray you know a lossary
[1:15:38] hail Mary mother of God does not glorify
[1:15:41] God
[1:15:43] but you see God had a purpose
[1:15:46] and he wanted to be glorified
[1:15:50] he wanted to restore what we call the
[1:15:52] glory
[1:15:55] because the Bible says for all had
[1:15:57] sinned
[1:16:00] and all came short of that glory.
[1:16:04] So the purpose of God is to bring back
[1:16:07] that glory
[1:16:10] which was lost in the beginning
[1:16:13] which Adam had
[1:16:16] lost
[1:16:18] when he lost
[1:16:21] but God
[1:16:24] in himself
[1:16:26] that that glory
[1:16:28] must be restored.
[1:16:31] Amen. and it must be restored again,
[1:16:35] not to everybody, but to him that lost
[1:16:38] it.
[1:16:40] And that was man.
[1:16:45] Now, let's take it slowly here. Second
[1:16:49] Corinthians, we read this again, but let
[1:16:50] let us read it.
[1:16:52] Would
[1:16:54] to God ye could bear with me a little in
[1:16:56] my folly
[1:16:59] and indeed bear with me.
[1:17:02] For I am jealous over you with godly
[1:17:03] jealousy.
[1:17:06] For I have espoused you to one husband
[1:17:09] that I may present you as a chest virgin
[1:17:12] to Christ.
[1:17:16] Praise the name of the Lord. I know some
[1:17:18] of you were in overnight
[1:17:21] and and you do not have good sleep since
[1:17:23] then.
[1:17:25] But please,
[1:17:27] you have come.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil rob
[1:17:32] you came for
[1:17:36] the last time I doed in church
[1:17:39] many many years ago. I went to church
[1:17:43] and I had never doed before. Not even in
[1:17:46] the Anglican church. I was not losing.
[1:17:48] It was me. Whenever I went to church, I
[1:17:51] really did not want to lose anything.
[1:17:54] I sat in church and then I realized my
[1:17:58] eyes were closing.
[1:18:01] I did like this. And when I first when I
[1:18:04] turned to my neighbor,
[1:18:06] I found my neighbor dozing.
[1:18:10] I just Oh, this is why.
[1:18:13] So I got up from there
[1:18:15] and I searched another place and that
[1:18:18] was the last time I do
[1:18:21] because I found out a second
[1:18:24] that if you doze
[1:18:26] it is because maybe sometimes you are
[1:18:28] seated next to a person who is dozing.
[1:18:32] So look around neighbors
[1:18:35] make sure they sober.
[1:18:38] If you feel that you are becoming tired
[1:18:40] and sleepy, immediately look around you.
[1:18:44] It's okay if you want to change a seat.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:50] Now, I want you to see second
[1:18:51] Corinthians here.
[1:18:55] Paul was not saying I brought you to my
[1:18:58] denomination.
[1:19:00] I brought you to my church that you may
[1:19:03] become church members.
[1:19:07] That's why here we say we have no book
[1:19:11] but the Bible. We have no law but love.
[1:19:15] And then we say we have no membership
[1:19:20] but fellowship.
[1:19:23] So we we we are not yet registered
[1:19:25] members
[1:19:29] so that our headquarter can know I am
[1:19:31] doing a good job.
[1:19:35] We are not registering members.
[1:19:39] No one knows how many believers of this
[1:19:41] message are in the whole world.
[1:19:46] The Bible says the secret is God knoweth
[1:19:50] them that are he.
[1:19:54] We don't need to count believers
[1:19:57] because even sometimes those who claim
[1:19:59] they are, they are not.
[1:20:03] Oh my. And those who think they are not,
[1:20:05] they are actually messages.
[1:20:09] Some of them right now they are in the
[1:20:11] Catholic shrine.
[1:20:13] They think they Catholics but they are
[1:20:16] going to come. How many were Catholics?
[1:20:20] Look, look those hands. You were there
[1:20:24] but you came out. How many Anglicans?
[1:20:28] I'm one of them. You see? So we are
[1:20:31] hungry but we are here.
[1:20:34] How many Adventists here? Lift up your
[1:20:36] hand. No, no hand. No Adventist here. We
[1:20:41] must have a representative.
[1:20:42] How many Pentecostals?
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Okay. Right behind there. Even is
[1:20:48] another hand. Raise it up, brother.
[1:20:51] Yes. Over here. You see all the
[1:20:53] denominations?
[1:20:55] I can now go and continue in all these
[1:20:57] other denominations.
[1:20:59] There is something I'm trying to to get
[1:21:01] to you. This message
[1:21:04] came to call out the seed
[1:21:09] out of all denominations,
[1:21:12] not to build another denomination.
[1:21:18] Paul says, I have exposed you to one
[1:21:21] husband
[1:21:24] that I may present you as just as a just
[1:21:28] virgin to Christ.
[1:21:31] But Paul had a fear in his heart.
[1:21:35] He said, "I fear
[1:21:37] less by any means
[1:21:41] as a serpent beguiled Eve through his
[1:21:43] subility.
[1:21:48] So your minds should be corrupted from
[1:21:50] the simplicity."
[1:21:53] [Music]
[1:21:57] Are you following me?
[1:22:00] The simplicity that is in Christ.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor the simplicity that
[1:22:06] is in Christ.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; The simplicity that is in Christ.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Did you know what denominations have
[1:22:14] done?
[1:22:15] Oh my. May God help us to get this.
[1:22:18] Denominations have complicated
[1:22:20] Christianity.
[1:22:23] They have made it so hard to be a
[1:22:24] Christian.
[1:22:26] They told you if you are not a member of
[1:22:28] our denomination you are not a
[1:22:29] Christian.
[1:22:32] You are the only ones who are right and
[1:22:34] everybody else is false.
[1:22:37] You are either in our denomination
[1:22:40] or you are not going in a rap.
[1:22:42] But you see each of those denominations
[1:22:45] presented it that way.
[1:22:48] It was about them
[1:22:51] but never about Christ.
[1:22:53] And that's why God sends messengers in
[1:22:56] every generation.
[1:23:00] The purpose of the messenger
[1:23:02] is to drag it from the denominations.
[1:23:07] It's no longer about any church.
[1:23:10] It's no longer about any preacher. It's
[1:23:13] no longer about any denomination.
[1:23:15] It is now about Christ.
[1:23:19] And this is what Paul is trying to say
[1:23:20] here.
[1:23:23] So glad that I believe Paul's message.
[1:23:27] I'm so glad. I believe the message of
[1:23:30] brother.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; You know what it has helped me to see
[1:23:35] has taken me back again.
[1:23:38] The simplicity
[1:23:41] is in Christ Jesus.
[1:23:44] Let no man
[1:23:46] defile your mind
[1:23:49] and tie you to themselves.
[1:23:53] Today I'm going to deal with some
[1:23:54] things. May God help us
[1:23:58] to themselves
[1:24:00] and try to say if you leave me
[1:24:02] you have left Christ. No Christ is no
[1:24:06] longer tied to an organization.
[1:24:10] Christ is no longer tied to a church.
[1:24:13] Christ is tied to one thing,
[1:24:17] the word.
[1:24:20] Amen. And by the way, this is the
[1:24:22] purpose of the message.
[1:24:26] You know the purpose of the message by
[1:24:29] lose them
[1:24:31] and let them go.
[1:24:33] So we have been loosed.
[1:24:36] We were in the tombs of a region.
[1:24:40] We were tied down.
[1:24:42] We were imbalmed.
[1:24:47] And we were in the tombs there. When we
[1:24:50] heard the voice,
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; what was it? A shout of
[1:24:55] Lazarus
[1:24:57] come out.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; You know, I heard my name and we had we
[1:25:01] we we already learned how we hear our
[1:25:04] name.
[1:25:06] When we hear the revelation
[1:25:09] of the word the mysteries of the word
[1:25:13] when they unveiled
[1:25:15] as they are unveiling
[1:25:18] then you hear your name
[1:25:22] how by the revelation
[1:25:27] in that revealed
[1:25:30] you hear your name here I was in in in
[1:25:32] the anglicant to home
[1:25:35] but when I add my name. I came out. I
[1:25:39] came out and here I am. Where am I? I am
[1:25:43] back again to the simplicity that is in
[1:25:46] Christ.
[1:25:49] [Applause]
[1:25:51] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; So do not let anyone be you and spill
[1:25:56] your minds, corrupt your minds.
[1:26:00] For if he that preach comes preaches
[1:26:02] another Jesus
[1:26:05] whom we have not preached or if he
[1:26:08] receive another spirit which he have not
[1:26:10] received or another gospel which you
[1:26:14] have not accepted ye might well bear
[1:26:17] with him.
[1:26:19] Let me pause this for a moment.
[1:26:23] We've had people who increasingly say
[1:26:27] just preach what you believe.
[1:26:30] Don't talk about where you came from.
[1:26:33] It looks like as if you're talking
[1:26:34] against those people.
[1:26:37] No, we are not talking against anybody.
[1:26:40] We're talking about the systems
[1:26:43] which had tied us down.
[1:26:46] You talk about Lazarus,
[1:26:49] tell me brother, who could tell Lazarus,
[1:26:52] don't talk about the tomb.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Is it possible? I believe from the time
[1:26:59] he came out
[1:27:01] to the time he died, he he was giving a
[1:27:04] testimony of how he was made alive
[1:27:08] of how he was quickened.
[1:27:11] But you see, you could only give that
[1:27:13] testimony without talking about the
[1:27:16] grave
[1:27:18] where he was. He said, "I was bound.
[1:27:22] I was in the grave. But he called me out
[1:27:27] and he quickened me up. Now I am alive.
[1:27:32] Hallelujah.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so Paul's work
[1:27:38] was to introduce the church to Christ.
[1:27:43] It was to introduce the church to
[1:27:45] Christ.
[1:27:48] 1 Corinthians 1:12.
[1:27:51] Please allow me to study this with me.
[1:27:54] Slowly
[1:27:55] slowly
[1:27:57] as you get it and as you have an open
[1:28:01] vers.
[1:28:04] Now this I say
[1:28:07] that every one of you saith, I am of
[1:28:09] Paul
[1:28:13] and I of Apollo
[1:28:16] and I of Ke
[1:28:19] and I of Christ.
[1:28:22] Are you hearing me?
[1:28:24] You are not hearing me right. I want you
[1:28:26] to respond. Are you hearing what I'm
[1:28:29] saying? I know you are hearing but I'm
[1:28:31] saying are you following
[1:28:34] now? Here you see Paul
[1:28:37] is saying something here. Some of you
[1:28:41] are saying you're of Keas, you're of
[1:28:43] Apollos, you are of Paul
[1:28:48] and and some of you say you're of
[1:28:49] Christ.
[1:28:51] And then he asks a question.
[1:28:53] Is Christ divided?
[1:28:57] Was Paul crucified for you?
[1:29:01] Or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?
[1:29:04] He said, "I thank God that I baptized
[1:29:07] none of you,
[1:29:09] but Chris and gasas,
[1:29:12] lest any should say that I baptized in
[1:29:15] my own name,
[1:29:18] and I baptized also the house of of
[1:29:21] Stephanus.
[1:29:23] Besides that, I know not whether I
[1:29:25] baptize anyone.
[1:29:28] For Christ sent me not to baptize,
[1:29:33] but to preach the gospel,
[1:29:35] not with wisdom of words,
[1:29:38] lest the cross of Christ should be made
[1:29:40] of anything.
[1:29:43] Now, there's a lot of things in there.
[1:29:47] But I want you to remember
[1:29:50] talks about Paul's manner of ministry.
[1:29:55] And he says that Paul's manner of
[1:29:56] ministry
[1:29:59] set the pattern.
[1:30:03] We have a lot of stereo here. Can you
[1:30:04] bring it down? It says it set the
[1:30:06] pattern
[1:30:08] for all future messengers of the air
[1:30:13] and for all ministers of the god.
[1:30:18] Paul's manner of ministry.
[1:30:22] How was Paul's manner of ministry?
[1:30:25] It had three things.
[1:30:27] Paul was true to the word.
[1:30:31] He never deviated from the word.
[1:30:35] Number one. Number two. Paul had
[1:30:38] vindication
[1:30:41] manifestation
[1:30:44] within his ministry.
[1:30:46] things which were seen,
[1:30:49] things which were known by others by
[1:30:51] seeing,
[1:30:53] things that God did.
[1:30:56] Those manifest to prove that God is with
[1:30:58] him.
[1:31:00] Then the third level,
[1:31:03] Paul had evident fruit of his ministry.
[1:31:09] Not to say, well, I've gone to preach
[1:31:10] and there's no one believing.
[1:31:13] There were souls
[1:31:15] that believed the gospel.
[1:31:18] Paul preached one God. Paul preached
[1:31:21] baptism in Jesus.
[1:31:24] Paul did not believe the trinity.
[1:31:27] Paul believed the Sabbath is receiving
[1:31:29] the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1:31:35] Paul told that tong should be spoken in
[1:31:37] church but with interpretation.
[1:31:42] And Paul taught many other things.
[1:31:45] But you see, he declared that uh that
[1:31:49] you cannot again make a camp or a
[1:31:52] denomination.
[1:32:00] You know, because he's saying some say
[1:32:01] they are of Apollo,
[1:32:04] some say they are of Paulo
[1:32:07] Keas and this and that. He's saying,
[1:32:10] "Brethren,
[1:32:12] my message did not come to make camps.
[1:32:18] My message did not come to start
[1:32:20] denomination.
[1:32:23] The purpose of my message
[1:32:26] by the way transport yourself and take
[1:32:28] yourself back in those days
[1:32:33] and understand it was not only Paul,
[1:32:36] there were other preachers.
[1:32:40] was a preacher.
[1:32:42] Was a preacher. And maybe there were
[1:32:44] even better preachers than Paul.
[1:32:47] Paul was a messenger of the earth.
[1:32:52] And then he says, "Me, my message.
[1:32:55] I was not sent to start a denomination.
[1:32:59] I was not sent to start a camp.
[1:33:03] The purpose of my message
[1:33:07] was to bring people back again to
[1:33:10] Christ.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; To bring, let me say, put it this way,
[1:33:16] bring the seed of God into a saving
[1:33:19] relationship with Christ
[1:33:25] by what? By the preaching of God.
[1:33:29] This is true today.
[1:33:31] Amen.
[1:33:32] This is true today. The purpose of the
[1:33:34] message of Yahweh,
[1:33:37] always give me that picture because you
[1:33:38] know there's I'm referring to
[1:33:42] seven messengers. The purpose of the
[1:33:44] message today
[1:33:47] is not so that Paul or William Brham can
[1:33:51] make his own come.
[1:33:57] Do you know that some people have made
[1:33:58] this message look like a cow?
[1:34:02] They want to show that everything they
[1:34:05] are preaching
[1:34:07] is out of this world.
[1:34:11] They want to present the message
[1:34:14] as something entirely new.
[1:34:17] Allow me to help you this morning. The
[1:34:20] message is not something new.
[1:34:24] The purpose of the message
[1:34:26] was to finish the mystery.
[1:34:32] not to start it. It has always been
[1:34:36] here.
[1:34:38] Messengers of different ages
[1:34:41] have been preaching the same things.
[1:34:45] But in our generation,
[1:34:48] the last messenger
[1:34:50] comes to tie the loser.
[1:34:56] Can you imagine? There are people who
[1:34:57] are currently saying,
[1:35:01] "Oh, brother is not a true prophet."
[1:35:04] Oh, when I was reading his books,
[1:35:07] I found that he he said the same things
[1:35:10] that another preacher had.
[1:35:15] I thought he received his teachings by
[1:35:17] supernatural
[1:35:20] imposition.
[1:35:24] Let me tell you brother don't be
[1:35:26] deceived.
[1:35:27] Brother Bon himself said he read books
[1:35:33] of other preacher.
[1:35:36] He even mentions those preacher.
[1:35:39] He says he read it.
[1:35:43] He studied it. And then he says but I
[1:35:46] disagree
[1:35:48] with them on this and this and this and
[1:35:49] that.
[1:35:51] M
[1:35:52] but I agree with them here
[1:35:56] where they got it right.
[1:35:59] So as a prophet of the age
[1:36:03] he how did he tie the loose ends?
[1:36:08] How did he tie the loose end?
[1:36:11] Yes. Uhhuh. How did he do that? by
[1:36:14] identifying
[1:36:17] where God had spoken
[1:36:20] and by showing us where man was
[1:36:24] misleading us.
[1:36:27] He dissected the thing
[1:36:31] and brought it to a an a wonderful
[1:36:34] conclusion.
[1:36:37] And the message we have today,
[1:36:40] it was given by God.
[1:36:43] What is it? It is Christ.
[1:36:47] The message is not something
[1:36:48] complicated.
[1:36:51] The message is Christ.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; The message is Christ.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; It is not some complicated. There are
[1:37:01] people who want to preach everything
[1:37:02] they preaching. They're saying the
[1:37:03] mystery, the mystery, the mystery.
[1:37:11] until you are in the message. But every
[1:37:13] time your head is going in circles
[1:37:18] and
[1:37:22] you don't even understand it yourself,
[1:37:25] but but because the way they have
[1:37:27] presented it to you,
[1:37:30] it looks so complicated
[1:37:33] and because it is complicated, you think
[1:37:35] it is true.
[1:37:39] And then when someone asks you what is
[1:37:41] the message of Yahweh
[1:37:45] brother God sent a prophet
[1:37:48] and the message is true.
[1:37:50] Can can you first calm down
[1:37:54] and understand the message is not the
[1:37:55] prophet.
[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:37:59] Am I hurting some of you? The message is
[1:38:02] not the prophet.
[1:38:04] The message is Christ.
[1:38:07] Hallelujah.
[1:38:08] Amen. Jesus Christ
[1:38:11] yesterday, today and forever.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Why does he send his men?
[1:38:18] send them to come
[1:38:21] and finish what he started
[1:38:25] and bring us
[1:38:28] into a saving relation
[1:38:36] said what are you saying
[1:38:43] Christ divided
[1:38:46] meaning I don't care who is preaching.
[1:38:51] As long as they're preaching the word,
[1:38:54] I believe what they saying, I follow
[1:38:57] what they are saying. But the moment
[1:38:59] they walk away from the word
[1:39:02] from that day, I walk away from them.
[1:39:07] And Paul said follow me
[1:39:12] as I follow Christ.
[1:39:16] So we are following Christ.
[1:39:18] When we follow Paul, we are following
[1:39:21] Christ.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; When we follow Brham,
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; as long as what is teaching
[1:39:27] is the word.
[1:39:31] Hallelujah.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Are you beginning to see it now?
[1:39:35] So now is the same thing today.
[1:39:39] This message is not for starting. Come.
[1:39:45] Amen. What is a denomination?
[1:39:49] Let me define it to you in a very simple
[1:39:51] way.
[1:39:52] A denomination
[1:39:54] is a group of people that organize
[1:40:01] and close everybody out.
[1:40:08] If you are not with them,
[1:40:11] you are lost.
[1:40:14] Yes sir.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what they claim to
[1:40:16] believe.
[1:40:18] That's a denomination.
[1:40:21] But what is the message?
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; The message
[1:40:25] is not about us. It's not about our
[1:40:28] church. It's not about our organization.
[1:40:31] It's not about our pastor. It's not
[1:40:34] about our prophet.
[1:40:36] Is about Christ.
[1:40:39] Amen. So whenever you see
[1:40:42] a group organizing organizing organizing
[1:40:46] around something else
[1:40:51] that is a denomination
[1:40:54] you know what they do they have a set of
[1:40:57] doctrines
[1:41:00] believe this and this and this and this
[1:41:05] came and said
[1:41:07] well as as far as We are concerned.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; We believe in this and this and this and
[1:41:12] this and this
[1:41:15] and everything else
[1:41:17] the Holy Spirit will reveal to us.
[1:41:20] Our revelation is not closed.
[1:41:25] Come on DVF help me to preach to you
[1:41:27] this morning. Our revelation has not
[1:41:29] ended.
[1:41:32] Revelation is continuous
[1:41:36] because you cannot finish God.
[1:41:39] The word of God the unarchable riches
[1:41:44] unarchable riches.
[1:41:47] Where are they? They are in Christ.
[1:41:52] So you cannot finish it. And that is why
[1:41:55] we are not a denomination.
[1:41:58] Everybody is welcome.
[1:42:01] We have no membership but we have
[1:42:03] fellowship one with another.
[1:42:07] Amen.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; So there is no small use and big use
[1:42:15] saying oh Paul is a big preacher
[1:42:20] but Julius is a very small
[1:42:24] there is nothing like that.
[1:42:28] I fear that so many have started their
[1:42:31] own denomination
[1:42:34] yet they still claim to believe the
[1:42:35] message.
[1:42:38] They are not message believers.
[1:42:40] They have their own denomination.
[1:42:43] A true message believer
[1:42:45] you will know it's about Christ.
[1:42:49] Every minister ordained of the Lord
[1:42:53] will be focused on that one thing.
[1:42:59] that Christ,
[1:43:01] Amen, may have the preemin
[1:43:17] on this Sunday morning.
[1:43:19] I did not come with the attitude
[1:43:23] that let me go and show them I know
[1:43:26] something.
[1:43:30] Let me go and show them I know how to
[1:43:32] preach.
[1:43:35] That's not what it's all about.
[1:43:39] What a preacher does. A sincere preacher
[1:43:42] of the gospel. He will say let me go and
[1:43:46] for adventure Lord
[1:43:48] you will help me to make them see you.
[1:43:54] That's the purpose of preaching the
[1:43:56] gospel
[1:43:58] that we might bring you into a saving
[1:44:00] relationship with you.
[1:44:03] And Paul said, "Husbands,
[1:44:06] love your wives as also Christ loved the
[1:44:09] church. And he gave himself for it that
[1:44:12] you might sanctify and cleanse it with
[1:44:14] the washing of the water by the blood
[1:44:18] that he may present it to himself
[1:44:22] a glorious church
[1:44:25] without having spot wrinkle
[1:44:28] or any such thing
[1:44:30] but that it should be holy and without
[1:44:33] blemish.
[1:44:36] I want two things I want us to see
[1:44:37] there.
[1:44:39] He sanctifies
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; and cleanses the church.
[1:44:44] Who does that?
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[1:44:51] He sanctifies.
[1:44:52] Who is the church? I am the church. You
[1:44:55] are the church. He sanctifies you and
[1:44:59] cleanses you.
[1:45:01] Oh, let me pause that right now. You
[1:45:04] cannot sanctify yourself.
[1:45:08] You cannot cleanse yourself.
[1:45:11] And many of you try to do it.
[1:45:17] And many preachers try to do it.
[1:45:21] How do they try to do it? The preachers
[1:45:23] try to do it by by teaching legalism.
[1:45:29] You must do this and this and this and
[1:45:32] the people try to do it.
[1:45:38] I have no doubt. I have so many here
[1:45:41] trying hard.
[1:45:43] Brother, you are trying hard
[1:45:46] to live a better life.
[1:45:49] Sister, are you not trying hard?
[1:45:54] And then sometimes you come to the
[1:45:55] person say, "Pastor, it's not working
[1:45:57] out.
[1:46:00] Do you know I even made I said, "Oh
[1:46:02] Lord, I'm not going to do this. I'm
[1:46:04] going to do things like this.
[1:46:09] But every time I keep going
[1:46:15] and you're like, "But is it even
[1:46:16] possible?
[1:46:18] Is it even possible
[1:46:20] really live according to what they want
[1:46:25] and some people made conclusion
[1:46:28] and they said it is not possible,
[1:46:32] let me live my life.
[1:46:36] No,
[1:46:37] I'm not going to kill myself.
[1:46:42] After all, that is how I feel.
[1:46:46] I've tried but it has failed.
[1:46:54] But before I finish the word, when I see
[1:46:58] the next God, I all melt down.
[1:47:02] For that cause it will not be possible.
[1:47:07] Probably a serpent seed.
[1:47:15] God does not speak no sense. There must
[1:47:17] be somebody speaking like that. Now
[1:47:19] believers help me to preach this.
[1:47:23] I'm going to tell you why you are that
[1:47:26] way. Afterwards I give you a solution
[1:47:30] you are that way. Because you are you
[1:47:33] are you are trying to sanctify yourself.
[1:47:37] You are trying to cleanse yourself.
[1:47:40] But I will have you know there's nothing
[1:47:43] you have within yourself
[1:47:46] to cleanse yourself.
[1:47:52] If you did Christ died in vain
[1:47:57] but I will give you a solution this
[1:47:59] morning. Amen. What do you have to do?
[1:48:04] Submit yourself
[1:48:06] to the word of God.
[1:48:09] Why? Because what Christ does,
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; he came and died on the cross
[1:48:16] and then he shed his blood and that
[1:48:19] blood is the bre bleach
[1:48:23] that removes every stain.
[1:48:26] I have a desire for sin.
[1:48:29] a bloody soft
[1:48:32] that anyone goes and dips himself.
[1:48:38] He will always be made white as snow.
[1:48:44] Even if they were sinners, he says come.
[1:48:48] Even if you have sin that is as red as
[1:48:51] color
[1:48:57] to wash yourself.
[1:48:59] Come
[1:49:01] and dip yourself.
[1:49:03] Oh well crimson is a flow.
[1:49:08] Amen. Washes me white as
[1:49:12] nothing other than the blood of Jesus.
[1:49:17] But the blood of Jesus is here right now
[1:49:23] in the form of the word
[1:49:26] in the form of a revealed word.
[1:49:30] Listen church. If there was no
[1:49:36] Amen. A don't know how you want to call
[1:49:38] it like a lock.
[1:49:41] If there was no God, everybody would
[1:49:44] access the blood.
[1:49:46] And I will tell you, brother, everybody
[1:49:49] that accesses the blood.
[1:49:52] You go in the rapture,
[1:49:54] but not everybody's going in the
[1:49:58] not everybody has access.
[1:50:02] Why? Because the thing was
[1:50:07] the mystery of Christ.
[1:50:10] has been hidden away
[1:50:12] in all generations
[1:50:14] in all ages. But in the days of the
[1:50:17] voice of the son of angels
[1:50:20] begin
[1:50:22] mystery.
[1:50:25] And when that mystery is finished,
[1:50:28] glory is restored.
[1:50:30] When the glory is restored, then you are
[1:50:33] sanctified.
[1:50:34] Then you are clean.
[1:50:36] How? by spiritual revelation.
[1:50:42] It comes to you, by hearing from the
[1:50:45] open book.
[1:50:49] What is the open book? The open book is
[1:50:53] the message of the angel of your day.
[1:50:59] All the others are preaching from a
[1:51:01] closed book.
[1:51:04] Paul in his day preach from an open
[1:51:06] book.
[1:51:08] If I may want to bring it that way, but
[1:51:10] we know in our day,
[1:51:13] we are preaching from an open book.
[1:51:17] The word, the revealed word.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, the revealed word of
[1:51:22] the hour.
[1:51:25] Amen.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, can we now go back
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; that he might sanctify you
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; and cleanse you.
[1:51:35] Amen. With the washing
[1:51:39] of the water
[1:51:41] by the word,
[1:51:45] you now see that is the word
[1:51:48] that we will wash and cleanse.
[1:51:53] So whenever we sing, oh precious,
[1:52:00] God makes me
[1:52:06] If you reject the word,
[1:52:08] the floor can't wash you.
[1:52:13] So there are many who are singing the
[1:52:14] song
[1:52:16] but it is meaning nothing
[1:52:18] and accomplishing nothing.
[1:52:21] But you can say this church, the
[1:52:23] believers of this end.
[1:52:26] We have a right to sing that song
[1:52:29] because we have received a revelation.
[1:52:32] The opening of the seven seed
[1:52:37] in our generation.
[1:52:39] Everything is finished.
[1:52:41] Everything is finished. So I can now say
[1:52:45] we have received a flow
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; of the blood of Jesus.
[1:52:54] It's all about Christ.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; So he does what? He
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; he
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; sanctifies me,
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; cleanses me.
[1:53:05] Now you may say
[1:53:08] as you remember everything I did.
[1:53:12] Are you sure I'm sanctified?
[1:53:15] It doesn't matter whether you remember
[1:53:18] that is your mind.
[1:53:22] And the Bible says you should let your
[1:53:26] mind be renewed.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Do not be conformed to the world
[1:53:33] but be transformed
[1:53:36] by the renewing of your
[1:53:40] hallelujah. Now he says continue to say,
[1:53:44] you see, then he presents after he
[1:53:46] cleanses the church
[1:53:48] and he sanctifies the church,
[1:53:50] then he presents the same church
[1:53:54] to himself.
[1:53:57] A glorious church,
[1:53:59] a glorious church without separation.
[1:54:03] Hallelujah.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want to understand it, read
[1:54:07] the book of Esther.
[1:54:10] It is him
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; that sent the the chamber line
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; that went and and cleansed and washed
[1:54:20] the wrong time. And when it came time
[1:54:23] for Esther to be presented to the
[1:54:25] bridegroom,
[1:54:28] she said, "I want nothing else.
[1:54:31] Nothing but the blood.
[1:54:35] Nothing but the word of God.
[1:54:40] Nothing but the message of the hour.
[1:54:44] Do you get it brother?
[1:54:47] So now we have been presented to him
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; as a glorious church
[1:54:54] without spo
[1:55:14] Vers
[1:55:17] 8.
[1:55:18] Beware lest any man spoil you through
[1:55:20] philosophy
[1:55:26] and vain deceit,
[1:55:30] after the tradition of men,
[1:55:34] after the rudments of the world,
[1:55:37] and not after Christ.
[1:55:44] and not after Christ.
[1:55:50] For in him dwell the fullness of the God
[1:55:52] himself.
[1:55:54] Oh, please follow me closely. I know you
[1:55:56] have read this many times.
[1:55:59] But God is about to open another
[1:56:04] and you are complete in him
[1:56:08] which is the head of all princip.
[1:56:14] Amen. So where is the completeness of
[1:56:18] the body of the bride of Christ?
[1:56:22] The comp our being complete
[1:56:27] cannot be found in ourself
[1:56:32] but it is found in Christ.
[1:56:37] [Applause]
[1:56:39] Amen. It is found in Christ.
[1:56:43] The Bible says we are complete in him.
[1:56:48] So let me announce to you church. Quit
[1:56:51] trying.
[1:56:55] Just stop it. It's not helping.
[1:56:58] Is pushing you deeper and deeper into
[1:57:00] sin.
[1:57:04] Yield yourself
[1:57:06] to Christ
[1:57:08] word
[1:57:10] how
[1:57:12] not only by prayer
[1:57:15] by feeding on the word
[1:57:18] [Applause]
[1:57:20] not only by a preaching on Sunday
[1:57:22] morning
[1:57:25] come on Wednesday also
[1:57:27] not only that read the word on your own
[1:57:32] read this Bible Listen
[1:57:35] to the message of the Allah.
[1:57:40] When you do that, then you will find
[1:57:45] complete in him,
[1:57:49] the more you yield yourself to the Lord.
[1:57:52] Amen. The more you will overcome the
[1:57:54] world.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. That That's right.
[1:58:02] So now, Apostle Paul warns us here
[1:58:06] and he says, "Be aware,
[1:58:08] lest any man spoil you through
[1:58:10] philosophy."
[1:58:14] Paul warns us of three things.
[1:58:17] Oh, may God help me now. One,
[1:58:21] philosophy.
[1:58:24] Two, vain deceit.
[1:58:29] Three, tradition of men.
[1:58:33] Four, rudiments of the world.
[1:58:38] I can take one by one and I take an
[1:58:40] entire subject.
[1:58:43] But I want to just give you a little bit
[1:58:45] of maybe what you can call a synopsis
[1:58:47] here.
[1:58:50] Philosophy,
[1:58:53] the condition of men.
[1:58:56] You know what? I I I try to hint on
[1:58:58] those on Friday.
[1:59:01] We have a lot of traditions
[1:59:05] that have even try to creep into the
[1:59:07] message.
[1:59:09] Things which are not founded in the word
[1:59:14] but people will believe it
[1:59:16] and people do them.
[1:59:19] Why? Because they don't read the word by
[1:59:21] themselves.
[1:59:23] As long as their pastor says it,
[1:59:26] they follow blindly.
[1:59:28] The bride, the bl the bride is not
[1:59:30] blind.
[1:59:33] The bride has open eyes.
[1:59:37] Amen. Not suspicious,
[1:59:41] but with understanding of the word.
[1:59:48] You see, there are many traditions.
[1:59:52] You've seen people who say well the
[1:59:54] moment a brother fornicates or sister
[1:59:56] does something
[2:00:01] they come in the church on the on Sunday
[2:00:03] morning
[2:00:05] they begin confessing
[2:00:09] well then you have taken us back in the
[2:00:11] denomination
[2:00:14] that's what we did
[2:00:18] personally you grew up in the in theh
[2:00:21] east African Revival.
[2:00:25] This is what we used to do.
[2:00:28] We used to call itana,
[2:00:31] brother. We put you in the light
[2:00:34] and you come and confess these things
[2:00:38] before everybody.
[2:00:40] And sometimes you find a man that is
[2:00:44] respectable
[2:00:45] coming to begin talking about things.
[2:00:49] And some of us children
[2:00:56] you know by so doing you are not
[2:00:59] actually helping the body.
[2:01:02] You're just destroying.
[2:01:08] You're destroying the body. We are not
[2:01:10] confessors.
[2:01:13] We are not Catholic priests.
[2:01:21] This is not about me or about you. It's
[2:01:22] about Christ.
[2:01:26] Oh, brother, you don't know what I did.
[2:01:29] Well, the Bible says, "Confess your
[2:01:31] fault one to another."
[2:01:34] Well, if you feel like something some
[2:01:36] things can be heavy
[2:01:39] and there is no way you can let it go
[2:01:42] until you confess to somebody,
[2:01:45] let them pray with you. somebody
[2:01:48] spiritual and then it's not somebody to
[2:01:51] condemn you. It is someone who is going
[2:01:52] to help you.
[2:01:56] So you don't have to die with things.
[2:02:00] Get to somebody, talk with them,
[2:02:03] confess to them,
[2:02:05] someone like your pastor or a spiritual
[2:02:08] leader, somebody who is an elder or
[2:02:10] somebody that can listen
[2:02:12] and then they will pray with you. The
[2:02:15] Bible says you that are spiritual
[2:02:18] But also you do it while you are taking
[2:02:20] care of yourself.
[2:02:23] You can see this is on an individual
[2:02:24] basis
[2:02:27] not to bring you to come and confess to
[2:02:29] the whole.
[2:02:33] Are you following me? And then you find
[2:02:36] people who have tried to even come back
[2:02:39] to church.
[2:02:41] They will tell them you can't.
[2:02:44] Why? Oh, because the church is very
[2:02:46] angry with you.
[2:02:48] Very, very angry with you. What you did
[2:02:51] was so bad.
[2:02:53] You have to first stay there for like 5
[2:02:56] months. Enjoy the world. Then you can
[2:02:59] come back. If you see, you will come.
[2:03:03] Friends, where are these things in the
[2:03:04] world?
[2:03:06] Traditions of
[2:03:09] I don't see it in the If you see it,
[2:03:11] come show it to me.
[2:03:14] Then we shall begin also to do it here.
[2:03:17] But if I can't see it, I can preach it.
[2:03:21] I am going to preach to you Christ
[2:03:25] not traditions of
[2:03:29] you find even married couples things go
[2:03:33] wrong
[2:03:35] and then you find them you know running
[2:03:37] up. They tell them all come and confess
[2:03:38] in the church.
[2:03:44] God have mercy.
[2:03:46] So you find a married brother in the
[2:03:48] church.
[2:03:50] Forgive me.
[2:03:53] What did you do? I did a BCD
[2:03:56] from that day. Watch people who do that.
[2:04:01] They can never be revived again.
[2:04:06] They will always be in the church
[2:04:08] like a shadow.
[2:04:12] Because everybody knows whether
[2:04:18] brother
[2:04:20] if we we tell you to say everything you
[2:04:22] did in your entire life
[2:04:24] even people who were respected
[2:04:27] [Music]
[2:04:31] from that day.
[2:04:33] Brother Baka, even if he was trying to
[2:04:34] preach,
[2:04:40] I no longer feel the anointing.
[2:04:42] What happened? Traditions of men
[2:04:46] took life out of it.
[2:04:50] There are many traditions, right? And I
[2:04:52] know by saying these things, I may make
[2:04:55] some enemies.
[2:04:57] But I have to preach to you what I say.
[2:05:00] what is revealed to me in the word
[2:05:04] and these people are not helped
[2:05:07] and many times to be helped they have to
[2:05:09] go to another church
[2:05:12] and they vacate from their church and
[2:05:15] yet they love their church
[2:05:20] praise the name of the Lord
[2:05:23] and then you've had traditions like
[2:05:25] courtship has to be for 6 months
[2:05:33] I don't see it in the message.
[2:05:35] I tried and tried to look for that.
[2:05:38] I didn't find it.
[2:05:43] It's a tradition
[2:05:45] because they do not have the council of
[2:05:48] the word or rather they don't want to
[2:05:50] take people to the council of the word.
[2:05:55] try to structure the message as a set of
[2:05:58] rules.
[2:06:03] We have a better way.
[2:06:06] The better way is the word.
[2:06:10] The word will guide us.
[2:06:13] The word will defeat
[2:06:16] every place in every situation.
[2:06:20] It will always defeat something.
[2:06:22] Hallelujah. Amen. But if we we we we we
[2:06:26] try to take the word and leave it and
[2:06:28] then use traditions.
[2:06:32] That is not a word. And what makes it so
[2:06:35] sad, they quote it as if it is the
[2:06:37] message of the hour.
[2:06:42] Brother said that you should quote for
[2:06:44] six months.
[2:06:48] What if you me I want to do two months.
[2:06:54] There's no so it becomes a rule.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; You see, and I have a list of traditions
[2:07:05] or when you leave our church, you are
[2:07:08] out of grace.
[2:07:10] Oh, that has been so big
[2:07:13] in many denominations.
[2:07:16] But I really I mean churches.
[2:07:20] But of course they become denominations
[2:07:21] when they bring traditions instead of
[2:07:23] the word.
[2:07:26] I have personally spoken to people who
[2:07:29] are living in fear.
[2:07:32] He said pastor anything might happen to
[2:07:33] me. Why you know when I was you know my
[2:07:37] pastor said to me you have left your
[2:07:41] blessings here.
[2:07:44] The moment you leave this town, you are
[2:07:47] going with curses. Your blessings are
[2:07:49] still here.
[2:07:53] Okay. I will stay here. So I can stay in
[2:07:55] my blessings. You are staying in your
[2:07:57] ces.
[2:07:59] Because where there is love, where there
[2:08:02] is God, there is no fear.
[2:08:07] Hallelujah. You see friends, that is a
[2:08:10] tradition.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. your helper, your grace is not in
[2:08:18] a church.
[2:08:19] It is in Christ.
[2:08:22] Now see, everything is in Christ. Is all
[2:08:24] about Christ.
[2:08:28] You see, I hope there is no one staying
[2:08:31] in this church because of fear.
[2:08:34] Oh, what will the pastor say?
[2:08:37] If I go and join another church, you're
[2:08:40] welcome to do that
[2:08:42] as long as
[2:08:45] you are led by the Holy Ghost.
[2:08:49] We must always be led by the Holy
[2:08:51] Spirit.
[2:08:53] There are many things I want to read for
[2:08:55] you for you here. So today, if you just
[2:08:56] give me a chance,
[2:08:59] let me take a time to quote this course.
[2:09:02] in the choosing of a I didn't have time
[2:09:03] to gather all of them but
[2:09:07] say the same applies by choosing a
[2:09:09] church
[2:09:12] now you must pray over the church
[2:09:16] that you are fellowshipping in
[2:09:19] remember churches carry a spirit
[2:09:26] not the holy spirit
[2:09:29] a spirit
[2:09:32] Amen.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; You will go in a church and in that
[2:09:34] church there is a spirit of
[2:09:38] the spirit of
[2:09:40] other churches have a spirit of love and
[2:09:42] unity.
[2:09:45] Other churches you find witchcraft.
[2:09:50] I mean what I'm saying
[2:09:52] where you find people accusing each
[2:09:54] other that so and so beitched me.
[2:09:59] You find churches where which have anger
[2:10:03] right from the pastor to the lady.
[2:10:06] When the pastor is angry, he will show
[2:10:08] it. He can even slap you
[2:10:13] and it will come down from there to the
[2:10:15] families and people.
[2:10:19] They don't understand
[2:10:21] these people are not owned by the
[2:10:23] pastor.
[2:10:25] People are owned by Christ.
[2:10:28] The one who died for them,
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; the one who gave his life blood,
[2:10:34] the purchase of the blood,
[2:10:37] they must be treated with honor.
[2:10:43] So he says, remember churches carry a
[2:10:46] spirit.
[2:10:49] But he says, but you go into a church.
[2:10:52] Oh my, praise the name of the Lord. Or
[2:10:54] you can come even in a church where the
[2:10:57] spirit of that church they worship their
[2:11:00] pastor.
[2:11:05] Some may even call it love.
[2:11:09] But you can see it's almost crossing the
[2:11:11] line
[2:11:13] of love and worship.
[2:11:20] Sometimes you go to a church with other
[2:11:23] spirit thinking they the best.
[2:11:29] If you leave their church,
[2:11:32] you are sure going to
[2:11:37] some of you even as I'm preaching, you
[2:11:39] have been through.
[2:11:42] Churches carry a spirit
[2:11:46] whereby you think that there's a church
[2:11:48] which thinks our pastor is the number
[2:11:50] one pastor in this country.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; But that's the place of Christ.
[2:12:02] Christ is number one and all the other
[2:12:06] preachers
[2:12:07] are on the same level.
[2:12:10] Hallelujah.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:13] Amen. When I say the same level, I mean
[2:12:17] level of authority.
[2:12:19] But I understand in ministry we have
[2:12:22] seniority.
[2:12:25] We have elders,
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; men who have labored for many, many,
[2:12:29] many years.
[2:12:31] And the Bible says we need to honor
[2:12:33] them.
[2:12:36] Actually, the Bible even says you must
[2:12:39] never rebuke an elder openly.
[2:12:44] But you find people who are in churches
[2:12:47] that they they have no problem with
[2:12:49] rebuking preachers.
[2:12:52] And it's okay in that church.
[2:12:55] You join that spirit comes on you.
[2:12:58] They are the ones you find on social
[2:13:00] media.
[2:13:02] When a minister write something,
[2:13:05] you find these young young people
[2:13:07] writing things and abusing and and and
[2:13:10] rebuking these pastors.
[2:13:14] As long as this pastor is not my pastor,
[2:13:19] I am from another church and my pastor,
[2:13:21] my pastor also has a problem with
[2:13:25] So let me show him
[2:13:28] the speed of that
[2:13:32] should never come.
[2:13:35] We must always honor to such as servants
[2:13:39] of God as
[2:13:43] why the men of God
[2:13:46] Christ wants to have preeminence
[2:13:50] in us in the body in the mind.
[2:13:54] Amen.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; It's happening. Churches are carry a
[2:14:00] spirit.
[2:14:04] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; But you go into a church
[2:14:10] and if you will watch the behavior
[2:14:14] that church,
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; you just watch the pastor a while
[2:14:22] and you will usually find that the
[2:14:23] church acts like the pastor.
[2:14:30] Now you know why I'm preaching this
[2:14:31] thing.
[2:14:34] Because this is what I believe.
[2:14:38] And if I keep preaching it, you are
[2:14:41] going to begin behaving like that.
[2:14:45] Respecting men of God, respecting every
[2:14:47] pastor, respecting one another, honoring
[2:14:50] one another because this is what we
[2:14:52] stand for.
[2:14:54] [Applause]
[2:14:58] Sometimes I wonder if we just don't get
[2:15:01] one another's spirit in it instead of
[2:15:03] the Holy Spirit.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; You get to a place where a pastor is a
[2:15:09] really radical and carrying on and you
[2:15:13] will find out that the congregation is
[2:15:14] the same way.
[2:15:21] That's right. Is that not right?
[2:15:25] Sister peace
[2:15:27] are you sure know you're not yet a
[2:15:28] mother. So stay close.
[2:15:32] All right. Listen. You get to a place.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; Okay. I'll bring you to a church where I
[2:15:39] see the pastor stand
[2:15:42] jack their head back and forth.
[2:15:45] You watch the congregation. They do the
[2:15:48] same thing.
[2:15:52] You find when the pastor is doing like
[2:15:53] this,
[2:15:55] everybody begins doing like this.
[2:16:00] If the pastor preaching pulling trouser,
[2:16:05] every shame will come
[2:16:08] Julius will come.
[2:16:10] Everybody will be
[2:16:12] sure they're picking the spirit of their
[2:16:14] pastor.
[2:16:17] You watch the congregation,
[2:16:19] they do the same thing.
[2:16:22] You take a pastor
[2:16:25] just cut down anything.
[2:16:28] Usually the church will do the same
[2:16:29] thing.
[2:16:32] So if I was choosing a church,
[2:16:36] I would choose a genuine
[2:16:39] fundamental
[2:16:41] full gospel Bible church.
[2:16:50] If I was choosing one to put my family
[2:16:53] in.
[2:16:56] Praise the name of the Lord. And in the
[2:16:59] Ephesian age, brother to talk about the
[2:17:03] sacredness and the power of the church.
[2:17:09] How you know you cannot take the Holy
[2:17:11] Spirit from the people.
[2:17:14] God wants to lead his church.
[2:17:18] The pastor must rule over the church
[2:17:22] as the final authority.
[2:17:24] But he doesn't do it.
[2:17:29] Must be by the leadership of the Holy
[2:17:31] Ghost,
[2:17:33] not in a way.
[2:17:36] Oh sister, come and sing.
[2:17:39] This one is my cousin.
[2:17:41] Brother come and
[2:17:43] this one is my birthday.
[2:17:46] Sister come and and and teach school.
[2:17:50] This one is very close to
[2:17:55] God wants to lead us.
[2:17:58] He uses a man and that man must be led
[2:18:01] by God.
[2:18:04] Amen. And then when men choose
[2:18:10] to be under a certain ministry,
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; they must believe 100% that God is
[2:18:18] leading that man.
[2:18:23] Amen.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; If you don't, that's the the moment to
[2:18:28] walk away.
[2:18:34] Pastor
[2:18:35] Are you chasing us? I love you so much.
[2:18:39] Nobody should go. But let me tell you,
[2:18:43] even this is important.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; The moment you are in a church
[2:18:46] and you have 90%
[2:18:51] confidence in your pastor,
[2:18:55] it's time to look for another child.
[2:19:00] That's right. I wish I had the time. I
[2:19:02] did not prepare to talk about
[2:19:05] One time I preach.
[2:19:09] Why? Because this is a man that God has
[2:19:11] trusted
[2:19:13] blessed there in charge of your soul.
[2:19:18] You cannot just say let me go and try
[2:19:21] at least I get 50%. No.
[2:19:25] Well, you can get 50% in a church you
[2:19:27] are visiting.
[2:19:29] But if it's a home church,
[2:19:32] unless you call your home, you must
[2:19:35] believe in that ministry 100%.
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; God, but God wants to lead a church. God
[2:19:45] leads the preacher. God leads the
[2:19:47] pastor.
[2:19:49] God leads the people.
[2:19:52] Amen. If if if a brother comes up and
[2:19:54] tells me, see pastor, I've always told
[2:19:55] them
[2:19:58] pastor, I have the leadership of the
[2:20:00] Holy Spirit,
[2:20:02] you start a church 3 km from here.
[2:20:09] And I say shalom shalom. I will call him
[2:20:14] come brother shalom shalom and I will
[2:20:18] ask him a question. Are you sure? It is
[2:20:21] not you. It's the lead of the Holy
[2:20:24] Spirit.
[2:20:25] Yes, pastor. I have this sign. I have
[2:20:28] this prayer upon God.
[2:20:33] I I would say I you have my support.
[2:20:36] Matter of fact, I'll even give you some
[2:20:38] money and I'll ask the people to help
[2:20:41] you. And people who live around there,
[2:20:44] I'll tell them, go and support that
[2:20:47] brother.
[2:20:48] And those of you who feel like he can be
[2:20:51] a pastor,
[2:20:52] visit him and find out.
[2:20:57] What I just spoke now is almost
[2:20:59] impossible in the message.
[2:21:03] When I was in Australia,
[2:21:06] I met a pastor who has actually done it
[2:21:11] in reality
[2:21:15] and is still cooperating with this
[2:21:18] He told a couple or two
[2:21:21] who were it was like two hours away from
[2:21:23] the church
[2:21:26] said go find out
[2:21:28] if you are comfortable there
[2:21:32] it's all right you have my blessing
[2:21:36] and then they went but after a while
[2:21:41] they came back home said we are
[2:21:43] comfortable here
[2:21:45] we would rather drive 2
[2:21:50] Why?
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; It's all about Christ,
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; not me, not you.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; But where it it you find those wars and
[2:22:00] battles and fighting and fasting.
[2:22:04] It's not about Christ.
[2:22:08] Many times it's about the pocket.
[2:22:12] [Music]
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; What you mean? You have taken by brother
[2:22:22] he was trusting you
[2:22:25] but there is a big problem with you
[2:22:28] how can you take back
[2:22:31] but in other words you are saying
[2:22:34] how can you take my t
[2:22:39] it's not about Christ
[2:22:41] but if it is about Christ you don't care
[2:22:44] who go
[2:22:46] as long as they receiving the word.
[2:22:51] Hallelujah.
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; And that's the truth.
[2:22:55] And there's a big issue, brethren,
[2:22:58] that we do not read the message.
[2:23:01] So we get looped into these things,
[2:23:07] unawares.
[2:23:10] You find competition in the body
[2:23:13] because of these things. One time I'll
[2:23:16] teach on that extension.
[2:23:19] Let me continue a little bit here with
[2:23:20] the traditions.
[2:23:22] Then I would say you cannot plate your
[2:23:25] hair.
[2:23:27] The moment you plate
[2:23:31] you, you are even an outcast.
[2:23:34] We excommunicate you.
[2:23:38] Plating hair has never been a basis for
[2:23:40] excommunication.
[2:23:44] Your prophet, the prophet of this age
[2:23:48] said plated hair now looks beautiful.
[2:23:55] That's not me.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; But pastor, he meant me. It's all right.
[2:24:00] We shall go into what he meant later.
[2:24:04] I am telling you what he said.
[2:24:07] But why do you people want to go and
[2:24:09] examine them?
[2:24:11] Because they have a legalistic mindset.
[2:24:17] I actually met a pastor who told me. Oh,
[2:24:22] you know sisters should have because you
[2:24:23] know in the new Jerusalem
[2:24:27] hair is going to be going down.
[2:24:31] So they should have hair.
[2:24:34] Oh, their hair should first of all
[2:24:35] should not be plated.
[2:24:38] Should not be flowers there,
[2:24:41] no oil, but they should just comb it
[2:24:44] backwards.
[2:24:49] And it's a doctrine.
[2:24:52] You cannot even put
[2:24:54] anything on it.
[2:24:57] If you put
[2:25:00] because you see what used to happen is
[2:25:02] they used to tell them you can't put any
[2:25:04] oil
[2:25:06] you can't put any
[2:25:08] oils you know hair oils
[2:25:12] and if they do put
[2:25:15] then they would have to call them to
[2:25:16] come and repent before the church
[2:25:21] [Music]
[2:25:23] and and and and so what they used to do
[2:25:26] is get a cloth and tie their head
[2:25:34] and when they see them do that
[2:25:37] they will call them sister what is wrong
[2:25:40] with you
[2:25:42] can you remove that finger
[2:25:45] that's encroaching in someone's private
[2:25:50] it's none of your business as a preacher
[2:25:55] it's none of your
[2:25:57] See, but you see these are traditions
[2:26:02] and people can almost die for it.
[2:26:08] You must be happy that you have the
[2:26:09] liberty in Christ.
[2:26:12] Because I know of areas
[2:26:15] people can literally die for the things
[2:26:16] I'm talking about.
[2:26:20] Some younger sisters have walked away
[2:26:22] from the church
[2:26:24] because they are tormented
[2:26:28] and they don't know what to do. So their
[2:26:30] hair will get lice and all
[2:26:34] because they can't take care of it.
[2:26:37] What I would tell you as your pastor,
[2:26:40] good care of your hair as sisters,
[2:26:45] don't be dirty and looking
[2:26:48] good care of yourself.
[2:26:51] But I will also say look as natural as
[2:26:54] possibly you can
[2:27:00] [Applause]
[2:27:01] look as natural as you can.
[2:27:04] You don't need to be plastic and all
[2:27:07] worldly
[2:27:11] beautiful
[2:27:15] but I have no standard for you.
[2:27:18] I can't give you any standard.
[2:27:21] The standard is don't cut your hair.
[2:27:25] Don't look like the world. The rest is
[2:27:28] up to you.
[2:27:30] And every preacher needs to do that.
[2:27:33] Otherwise when you leave and you cross
[2:27:35] that line
[2:27:37] then you are going into legalism
[2:27:40] and these are traditions of men and I
[2:27:43] can assure you it is not after Christ
[2:27:51] you see
[2:27:53] hair must face here
[2:27:56] must face there
[2:27:59] should completely remove their hair.
[2:28:04] Have you heard of that before? How many
[2:28:06] have heard of that before?
[2:28:10] Men should remove all.
[2:28:13] You don't find that in the scripture.
[2:28:17] We are we we we are taught by Apostle
[2:28:19] Paul
[2:28:20] to keep our hair short.
[2:28:23] What is short hair?
[2:28:25] Short hair is cut hair.
[2:28:29] Yes, sir. As long as you trim it,
[2:28:33] you don't keep it like untrim.
[2:28:37] And if you trim your hair,
[2:28:39] the the rest you do with it is none of
[2:28:41] my
[2:28:45] if you have the spirit of Christ in you.
[2:28:48] You will not want to look like a dup
[2:28:52] some fashionist.
[2:28:57] But then you find preachers
[2:29:00] who have left preaching the things that
[2:29:01] are going to build people spiritually
[2:29:05] and then we are pushing for make your
[2:29:06] hair like this, make your hair like
[2:29:08] that, make your hair like this,
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; brother. It is so little.
[2:29:16] It's none of my business really.
[2:29:19] It's none of your business too.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; My business as a preacher
[2:29:27] is to preach to you Christ
[2:29:30] and Christ is the word.
[2:29:33] So anything not in the word is none of
[2:29:35] my business.
[2:29:37] When you believe the word they teach and
[2:29:40] they tell us as a tradition you have the
[2:29:42] Holy Ghost.
[2:29:48] You see that's a tradition also
[2:29:50] false doctrine and many believe that.
[2:29:54] And I wish I had time to continue
[2:29:58] but um um give me 10 minutes and I'll
[2:30:01] quit.
[2:30:04] Give you a few things here. Talks about
[2:30:06] the rudiments of the world.
[2:30:10] The rudiment of the world means here the
[2:30:12] basic worldly teachings and traditions
[2:30:16] that people rely on instead of Christ.
[2:30:24] [Music]
[2:30:26] When you are born again instead of
[2:30:28] Christ,
[2:30:30] when you are born again and you in
[2:30:32] Christ, you know what? You are dead to
[2:30:35] the ruments of
[2:30:38] meaning they no longer the ruments of
[2:30:40] the word no longer govern your life.
[2:30:47] How they see it doesn't govern my life.
[2:30:51] So opinion doesn't govern.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; What governs my life
[2:30:57] is Christ
[2:30:59] and Christ is the word
[2:31:02] as long as I'm submissive to the word.
[2:31:05] But how can you be submissive if you do
[2:31:07] not know the word?
[2:31:11] Study the message.
[2:31:13] Feed on the word.
[2:31:16] Praise the name of the Lord. Now I'm
[2:31:19] going to give you a quote probably the
[2:31:21] last one here. The question is the
[2:31:22] mystery of God revealed.
[2:31:27] Very good message for you to listen to.
[2:31:30] Although it's about three hours this
[2:31:31] one,
[2:31:32] but he says look Christ in you
[2:31:37] makes him the center of life of the
[2:31:41] revelation.
[2:31:45] makes him
[2:31:49] the center of life
[2:31:52] of the revelation.
[2:31:54] Christ in you
[2:31:57] makes him the center of the revelation.
[2:32:03] Christ in the Bible
[2:32:06] makes the Bible the complete revelation
[2:32:08] of Christ.
[2:32:10] [Applause]
[2:32:13] But Christ in you
[2:32:16] makes you
[2:32:19] complete revelation of the whole thing.
[2:32:25] Hallelujah. Amen. In other words, Christ
[2:32:28] is revealed in his word.
[2:32:31] Not revealed in me. The mystery of God
[2:32:35] is not yet finished.
[2:32:39] Amen.
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; Christ in me is the complete revelation
[2:32:43] of the whole.
[2:32:47] [Music]
[2:32:52] Glory.
[2:32:54] Glory
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; to whom God would make known the riches
[2:33:00] and the glory
[2:33:02] of this mystery
[2:33:06] which is Christ
[2:33:10] in you
[2:33:13] and then I prophesied Christ in you is
[2:33:17] the complete revelation
[2:33:21] of the whole
[2:33:24] what God is trying to do
[2:33:28] and now listen to this part. What is the
[2:33:31] new birth?
[2:33:34] This is a quote which I can read if I
[2:33:36] finish in a portion I'll confuse all of
[2:33:38] you. So
[2:33:44] you would say well what is the new
[2:33:47] birth?
[2:33:51] Listen. And he says, "It is
[2:33:55] the revelation
[2:33:56] of Jesus Christ personally to you.
[2:34:12] How many can say amen to that?
[2:34:15] The revelation of Christ personally to
[2:34:17] you
[2:34:20] is a new birth.
[2:34:23] It means you're born again.
[2:34:26] If you have the revelation
[2:34:28] of Jesus Christ,
[2:34:31] but if I stop there, I am going to make
[2:34:35] it just intellectual.
[2:34:38] And sadly many preachers have stopped
[2:34:41] there
[2:34:44] and then they begin to have all sorts of
[2:34:48] you know like uh revelations flying in
[2:34:50] the sky
[2:34:53] until one of them said we no longer
[2:34:57] receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:34:59] the way they did in
[2:35:10] So can I finish the quote?
[2:35:12] He says not. He says it is a revelation
[2:35:15] of Christ personally to you.
[2:35:22] Not you joined a church. Not you shook a
[2:35:25] hand. You've done something different.
[2:35:30] You promise to live a course of rules.
[2:35:34] But
[2:35:37] the Bible,
[2:35:39] he is the word that was revealed to you.
[2:35:44] And no matter what anybody say
[2:35:48] what takes place, it doesn't matter.
[2:35:51] It is Christ.
[2:35:54] Pastor, priest, whatever it might be, it
[2:35:56] is Christ.
[2:35:59] Christ in you, brother.
[2:36:02] That is the revelation
[2:36:06] upon.
[2:36:08] And he says, "What is it?" It is Christ
[2:36:11] being revealed.
[2:36:13] It is the word. And when the word is
[2:36:16] revealed,
[2:36:18] oh, listen now to this one. When the
[2:36:20] word is revealed,
[2:36:23] it expresses itself.
[2:36:29] That is God's purpose.
[2:36:32] Please help me now. I'm finishing. This
[2:36:35] is God's purpose
[2:36:37] for Jesus Christ
[2:36:40] was to express himself
[2:36:45] to take his own laws.
[2:36:49] Don't miss this one.
[2:36:51] take his own laws
[2:36:55] and live by his own laws
[2:37:00] and fulfill his own law. Hallelujah. By
[2:37:03] death.
[2:37:09] Amen.
[2:37:11] And Christ God died in flesh
[2:37:15] in order to condemn sin in the flesh
[2:37:19] that he might bring to himself a
[2:37:22] glorious bride
[2:37:25] redeemed back
[2:37:29] only in the word of God
[2:37:33] and not try to swap it
[2:37:36] like if
[2:37:38] intellectual conceptions of
[2:37:44] That's God's idea.
[2:37:47] The new birth reveals this.
[2:37:57] If you want to know whether you have the
[2:37:58] Holy Spirit, you have heard.
[2:38:02] Now
[2:38:04] many start there
[2:38:07] and on that basis they say
[2:38:11] days of miracles are passed.
[2:38:15] Manifestations,
[2:38:16] signs, wonders, tongs. I even had this
[2:38:20] preacher. He actually called tongs
[2:38:23] gibberish.
[2:38:27] And he said, "Oh, they
[2:38:30] they speak gibberish
[2:38:32] and they call it God. That's blasphemy.
[2:38:37] You need to listen to the message of the
[2:38:38] hour
[2:38:40] because according to his revelation,
[2:38:44] he believes that tongues are only other
[2:38:47] people's languages.
[2:38:54] But the Bible speaks of tongues of men
[2:38:58] and of angels.
[2:39:00] Is that right? And in
[2:39:04] many times they spoke tong that nobody
[2:39:06] knew.
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; And there was interpretation.
[2:39:11] Brother never said oh what a jibbery
[2:39:16] but he always said
[2:39:19] amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; Is it not what wonderful that God will
[2:39:24] come and confirm
[2:39:26] through tongues and interpretation?
[2:39:30] But the preachers of today are saying
[2:39:32] it's gibberish.
[2:39:34] The revelation of today if you want the
[2:39:37] Holy Spirit just believe the
[2:39:40] no that's misconception
[2:39:44] intellectual misconception.
[2:39:48] Let me now read you the second point.
[2:39:51] And if a man says he's born again
[2:39:55] and he tries to place these promises of
[2:39:57] Christ in these last days to some other
[2:39:59] age,
[2:40:07] making him Christ yesterday
[2:40:10] but not today, then that man or that
[2:40:13] person as a delusion of s.
[2:40:20] And if a man says that he believes that
[2:40:25] it doesn't manifest through,
[2:40:29] there's a problem. Jesus said in Mark
[2:40:32] 16,
[2:40:34] these signs, everybody say with me,
[2:40:36] these signs shall follow them.
[2:40:42] Hallelujah.
[2:40:44] And says, casting out devils.
[2:40:47] When I when I speak these signs, you
[2:40:49] say, "Amen." Casting out devils,
[2:40:52] speaking with tongues and all these
[2:40:55] great manifestations of gifts,
[2:40:59] they would follow.
[2:41:03] Amen. And he says they shall not that
[2:41:07] may be
[2:41:09] they ought to be will
[2:41:13] heaven and earth will pass away but his
[2:41:16] word will never pass away.
[2:41:19] If we say we are the people
[2:41:22] signs must be in our
[2:41:25] must move
[2:41:27] must be spoken.
[2:41:29] signs and wonders must happen.
[2:41:32] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; Testimonies must appear.
[2:41:36] And I'm so glad we have had testimony
[2:41:40] after testimony
[2:41:42] of the working of the Holy Ghost
[2:41:45] in our ministry
[2:41:47] and as I'm finishing, there's a brother
[2:41:50] who conducted me recently.
[2:41:52] Maybe some of you didn't even realize
[2:41:53] it.
[2:41:55] I was your brother Daniel and I met him.
[2:41:58] I think he did something for us. I had
[2:42:00] been a soldier for a long time, many
[2:42:02] years.
[2:42:04] But no uh no rank.
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; I told him, "Do you want a rank?" He
[2:42:10] said, "Sure." I said, "I give you that
[2:42:12] rank in the name of our Lord Jesus. I
[2:42:15] send it to you on the WhatsApp groups."
[2:42:18] He now has a rank.
[2:42:20] That's a manifestation.
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you saw the other testimony of
[2:42:26] the sister who came to our meeting
[2:42:28] and you know she she for she believed
[2:42:30] God for something that she thought was
[2:42:33] impossible.
[2:42:37] I want she told God I want to earn 3
[2:42:39] million.
[2:42:42] She was earning 7 500
[2:42:45] and I've just been up to 700.
[2:42:48] So she said God I want 3 million.
[2:42:53] I sent you the testimony.
[2:42:55] She's now earning 3.8.
[2:42:59] And she said, "Pastor, the testimony is
[2:43:00] still hot. I want to share it." And
[2:43:04] there have been other testimonies you've
[2:43:05] been hearing.
[2:43:07] There's another one that I'm still
[2:43:08] waiting for to to to to get to prove.
[2:43:12] But before we share these testimonies
[2:43:13] with you, we want to prove them for you.
[2:43:17] There's a sister who shared a wonderful
[2:43:18] testimony.
[2:43:20] of a wonderful manifestation of the Holy
[2:43:22] Ghost. Friends, I tell you, the word is
[2:43:24] real.
[2:43:25] The power is real.
[2:43:28] We should not settle for less.
[2:43:31] We love the word for the word is Christ,
[2:43:34] but that Christ must manifest himself in
[2:43:37] our lives.
[2:43:41] Amen.
[2:43:43] It's 1 p.m. I will finish here. God
[2:43:44] bless you.
[2:43:47] Amen.
[2:43:50] Can we stand on our feet?
[2:43:57] Praise the Lord.
[2:44:02] You know, we just love the word.
[2:44:05] &gt;&gt; I just wish everybody would come here
[2:44:07] during midweek.
[2:44:11] That would be lovely.
[2:44:15] Amen. Amen.
[2:44:22] [Music]
[2:44:23] Praise the Lord. Come out. Shall we
[2:44:27] sing? He made a way, brother. Shalom.
[2:44:28] Can you come and help me, please?
[2:44:34] He made a way. He made a way. He made a
[2:44:37] way by opening us this uh revelation of
[2:44:40] the hour.
[2:44:41] [Music]
[2:44:47] Oh, it's just a wonderful revelation,
[2:44:49] friends.
[2:44:51] If God can help you to get deeper
[2:44:56] fast,
[2:44:59] what a wonderful thing.
[2:45:02] I don't know how, but you did it.
[2:45:07] You made
[2:45:09] a way.

[3:07:02] &gt;&gt; to you, Jesus.
[3:07:04] &gt;&gt; We want to say
[3:07:06] We put you in front
[3:07:10] in front of everything Lord.
[3:07:13] We want you to have preeminence,
[3:07:17] &gt;&gt; in us as individuals,
[3:07:21] Lord, in us as husbands,
[3:07:25] as wives,
[3:07:28] &gt;&gt; children,
[3:07:29] come and have preeminence,
[3:07:32] be seen
[3:07:35] as a ministry,
[3:07:37] as a church. We don't want anyone to be
[3:07:40] sin.
[3:07:42] Forbid it, Lord.
[3:07:45] Let it always be about you, Jesus.
[3:07:49] Hallelujah.
[3:07:51] Let it always be about you, Lord.
[3:07:54] Forgive us. Many times when we stray,
[3:07:56] Lord, we do not represent you properly.
[3:08:01] Forgive us, Lord, and wash us
[3:08:04] in your blood, Lord Jesus.
[3:08:06] But our prayer tonight is that you will
[3:08:09] help us
[3:08:11] that we will let you have the
[3:08:12] preeminence
[3:08:16] in our lives.
[3:08:18] Father Lord we have those with need
[3:08:19] tonight.
[3:08:21] May you bless them Lord and provide
[3:08:24] provide.
[3:08:26] Create where there needs something to be
[3:08:28] created.
[3:08:30] Lord, as we had a brother give a
[3:08:32] testimony today
[3:08:35] of a good job. Perhaps there's somebody
[3:08:37] here, Lord, who wants a job.
[3:08:40] Lord, we have also had another testimony
[3:08:42] of another sister who got a good job.
[3:08:46] May you give whoever wants a job, Lord,
[3:08:50] give them a good job so they will be
[3:08:52] able to serve you with their substance.
[3:08:56] Grant it, Lord. Bless each and every one
[3:08:58] of us.
[3:09:00] Let your presence fill our hearts.
[3:09:03] Let your presence fill our hearts
[3:09:06] and give us a wonderful week Lord.
[3:09:10] Provide for every other need Lord.
[3:09:13] Spiritual and physical need Lord in
[3:09:15] Jesus mighty name we pray.
[3:09:18] Amen.
[3:09:19] [Music]
[3:09:21] Amen.
[3:09:23] Amen. Lord bless you saints.
[3:09:26] &gt;&gt; Uh just want to dismiss you shortly.
[3:09:30] But I wanted to uh let you know
[3:09:34] the brother said that you may be seated.
[3:09:36] The brother said that uh this weekend,
[3:09:38] this Sunday was the last Sunday
[3:09:43] for the target that we were trying to
[3:09:45] do.
[3:09:50] If you remember, I announced that u we
[3:09:52] were supposed to pay by 7th August.
[3:10:04] But I'm going to pro most likely I might
[3:10:06] travel before August before 7th
[3:10:10] Zimbabwe.
[3:10:14] So that means we have until
[3:10:18] Sunday.
[3:10:22] So probably we'll meet this gentleman on
[3:10:24] Monday next week.
[3:10:28] the other week.
[3:10:30] So, uh we still have a shortfall of
[3:10:33] about 2 million shillings.
[3:10:35] &gt;&gt; I had what exactly is it, brother Joel?
[3:10:38] Do you have the figure? Is it exactly 2
[3:10:41] million or more?
[3:10:44] &gt;&gt; 2.1
[3:10:47] &gt;&gt; 2.1. Yes. So, that's what we need to hit
[3:10:50] the 100 million target.
[3:10:54] Um, so remember this is not fully paying
[3:10:57] the land off.
[3:11:00] This is just doing the like what you
[3:11:02] would call a down payment
[3:11:06] so that we can now sit and deise a plan
[3:11:09] on how to pay the remainder of the 120
[3:11:11] million.
[3:11:15] Because remember the purpose was we were
[3:11:18] having we were here collecting money and
[3:11:22] then um you know land is appreciating
[3:11:29] for 4 years. We've been gathering money
[3:11:34] but but at that time land we were
[3:11:36] targeting in this area it was about was
[3:11:38] it 70 or 80
[3:11:45] A plot meaning 160 million.
[3:11:50] But now this area we cannot even try.
[3:11:54] A plot around here is about 150 million.
[3:11:59] If it's not in a wetland,
[3:12:02] you know there are many people who sell
[3:12:03] land but many times you go you find is
[3:12:05] in a wetland.
[3:12:10] Yes. So we we thought it is wise to take
[3:12:13] what we have
[3:12:16] and put it on a property
[3:12:19] and then we begin collecting putting on
[3:12:22] property.
[3:12:25] So we still need one uh 2.1 million
[3:12:31] to meet that uh need of the down
[3:12:33] payment.
[3:12:36] I should commend John Wizzley this week.
[3:12:38] They have really improved a lot.
[3:12:41] God bless you because last week I think
[3:12:43] things are about 20,000
[3:12:47] &gt;&gt; from 20 to 200,000 that's a
[3:12:50] very big improvement.
[3:12:53] God bless you and I hope that you can
[3:12:55] remain steady if we can all remain
[3:12:56] steady like that.
[3:12:59] It will help a great deal
[3:13:02] in achieving these targets.
[3:13:04] I should also mention I think you had a
[3:13:06] brother there's a sister from Kamoa all
[3:13:09] the way from Karamoja
[3:13:12] that we have a few people from Kamoja
[3:13:15] Island that stream our services
[3:13:20] and that sister is one of them.
[3:13:25] Um, so she sent she told me she's after
[3:13:28] after one of the subs she said she sent
[3:13:29] me a text. I did not know her but she
[3:13:31] said pastor I'd like to chip in
[3:13:33] something
[3:13:37] and she gave 100,000 shillings.
[3:13:40] So
[3:13:42] that is a very huge amount
[3:13:46] for someone injal
[3:13:50] giving 500,000
[3:13:55] That's really a big contribution
[3:13:58] from that sister and she needs us to
[3:14:00] really pray for her.
[3:14:03] That was a generous contribution.
[3:14:07] Then also remember there is the other uh
[3:14:09] the other part that we used on the youth
[3:14:11] camp
[3:14:14] which we also are intending to have
[3:14:17] fully attained by the time we are going
[3:14:20] to pay the down payment.
[3:14:32] which we are intending to also have
[3:14:34] because remember it's a part of 100
[3:14:36] million.
[3:14:39] Yes, it's a part of 100 million. So we
[3:14:41] intending to also have that
[3:14:47] and a brother heard about it.
[3:14:56] A brother heard about it
[3:14:59] from uh Nairobi,
[3:15:03] one of us,
[3:15:05] &gt;&gt; brother Kennedy,
[3:15:06] &gt;&gt; and he gave towards that 1,50,000
[3:15:11] shillings.
[3:15:14] [Applause]
[3:15:17] Uh so the there's remaining now um uh
[3:15:25] uh 30.5 minus uh 1.05
[3:15:30] that's about 29.45 45
[3:15:36] and I know there are one or two who who
[3:15:37] told me pastor we are going to
[3:15:38] contribute towards that as well
[3:15:42] just to remind you
[3:15:45] to also do what you can do.
[3:15:48] You know saints we are doing these
[3:15:50] things by faith.
[3:15:53] Without faith it is impossible to please
[3:15:55] God.
[3:15:57] We have no solutions for anything.
[3:16:01] But if I have known the great things I
[3:16:03] have done in my life,
[3:16:07] I have done them by faith.
[3:16:10] &gt;&gt; I've told this story many times
[3:16:13] to a few and I'll tell it here again.
[3:16:17] One time I had a land I had purchased I
[3:16:20] was purchasing a certain a piece of land
[3:16:21] or half an acre
[3:16:28] that's about uh almost 10 years ago.
[3:16:32] So um I uh the land was a certain amount
[3:16:38] and uh so I wanted to pay a down and
[3:16:40] then I I I had some money in my hands
[3:16:45] and I felt I should put it in a in an
[3:16:47] asset
[3:16:50] but I wanted a huge asset.
[3:16:53] So I I I went and I met this owner the
[3:16:57] seller like the one we met this time
[3:16:58] because they are all real estate agents,
[3:17:00] real estate people.
[3:17:11] God bless you. So
[3:17:20] real estate
[3:17:23] company
[3:17:31] there's a difference between the brokers
[3:17:33] and the real estate people.
[3:17:38] company
[3:17:40] like even this land we are purchasing
[3:17:42] for the for the church it's not owned by
[3:17:44] an individual
[3:17:47] it's a um an individual who is running a
[3:17:50] real estate company
[3:17:54] and his offices are in
[3:17:58] road
[3:18:00] &gt;&gt; so uh this land that I was purchasing
[3:18:03] years ago
[3:18:05] was also like that. So I met this owner,
[3:18:10] she she was also that time she was a
[3:18:12] lady, she was
[3:18:15] so she was a Pentecostal like this one.
[3:18:19] So I told her I have just 6 million
[3:18:25] and she laughed. She said, "Pastor,
[3:18:28] you think you buy you you you buy land
[3:18:30] like you buy tomatoes?
[3:18:32] [Music]
[3:18:33] Go and look for money."
[3:18:35] &gt;&gt; I said, "Listen,
[3:18:37] I'm going to give you this money."
[3:18:40] But you a Christian, believe me, you
[3:18:43] don't believe my me. Believe my God. I'm
[3:18:47] going to come back. I told her within 3
[3:18:49] months
[3:18:51] and I will pay the rest of the month if
[3:18:54] you give me. Did I ask for three or six
[3:18:55] months? So,
[3:18:57] I'll pay you the whole balance. And the
[3:19:00] balance was huge.
[3:19:03] She said, "Okay, I'm going to take this
[3:19:04] money,
[3:19:06] but there is no there is no assurance
[3:19:08] that the land is yours
[3:19:11] until you pay them." I said, "Trust me.
[3:19:14] My God will do it."
[3:19:16] Honestly, I did not have any idea where
[3:19:19] I'll get the money.
[3:19:23] Faith does not have hope.
[3:19:28] But faith hopeeth all things.
[3:19:33] You don't have because hope is based on
[3:19:37] a promise or something.
[3:19:40] Someone says, "I'll give you I'll help
[3:19:41] you." Then you promise somebody else on
[3:19:44] the best.
[3:19:47] But I did not have any hope.
[3:19:50] But I had faith. I believed that God is
[3:19:53] able to do it.
[3:19:56] Well, I I went back to Ethiopia because
[3:19:59] at that time I was still a pastor in
[3:20:02] Ethiopia.
[3:20:03] &gt;&gt; And then there happened to be one of the
[3:20:05] brothers in the church
[3:20:08] who was um you know sending tithe on my
[3:20:11] account at the time
[3:20:17] and um and uh he but I did not know I
[3:20:22] did not know really who was sending the
[3:20:25] money from because he had not called me
[3:20:28] and this money came on my account.
[3:20:32] Then I saw a notification
[3:20:35] and money came again
[3:20:39] and the money came again and the money
[3:20:41] came again like six seven times
[3:20:45] a certain amount not small
[3:20:50] and it came about seven or 10 I don't
[3:20:52] remember about seven or 10 times
[3:20:55] a number of times I said wait am I
[3:20:58] dreaming
[3:21:00] so I checked my account
[3:21:03] and I indeed found the balance there
[3:21:06] and it was more than what I needed to
[3:21:08] pay the balance of the land.
[3:21:12] So I I said to myself, I'm not going to
[3:21:15] first find out who said the money.
[3:21:19] Let me fast forward the money
[3:21:22] to the owner of the other land.
[3:21:25] Then I can do the investigation later.
[3:21:28] So I forwarded all the money
[3:21:33] and I told her
[3:21:36] balance paid in full.
[3:21:40] I said I need my land title.
[3:21:43] Today I have that land title
[3:21:47] and that's my testimony.
[3:21:55] Now, so today when people see it, they
[3:22:02] did buy it.
[3:22:10] But you see friends, we have a God in
[3:22:13] heaven.
[3:22:15] We have a God in heaven.
[3:22:17] And he gave me that land. I paid him for
[3:22:19] it.
[3:22:21] Now I went in the investigation.
[3:22:24] Who must have said that?
[3:22:27] So I went got a banker statement.
[3:22:32] I don't a brother in charge.
[3:22:35] He said brother how much money did you
[3:22:37] send some money? He said yes.
[3:22:39] I said how much money? He said I sent
[3:22:42] this such an amount for this and this
[3:22:45] purpose.
[3:22:48] I said, "Brother, but I received this
[3:22:50] much." He said, "No, I didn't send it."
[3:22:54] So I, he said, "Let me investigate. Let
[3:22:56] me find out."
[3:22:58] His brother had left the orders with the
[3:23:01] bank.
[3:23:04] But the bank kept on pressing,
[3:23:08] "Send faith. Send
[3:23:12] faith."
[3:23:13] But every failure
[3:23:15] was a breakthrough for me.
[3:23:17] [Laughter]
[3:23:18] [Applause]
[3:23:21] And and so I I realized the bank had my
[3:23:25] bank had leed my account balance
[3:23:31] [Music]
[3:23:33] like when I after spending it, they put
[3:23:35] it on a lean balance.
[3:23:40] So I contacted the bank. I said I'm
[3:23:42] seeing I received a lot of money. I
[3:23:45] don't know where it came from, but I
[3:23:46] also saw a lot of um uh I'm seeing a lot
[3:23:50] of lean balance on my balance.
[3:23:54] &gt;&gt; I don't know what it means. I never
[3:23:56] taken a loan before. Those who have
[3:23:58] taken a loan, you know
[3:24:01] means
[3:24:02] outstanding respect.
[3:24:11] [Music]
[3:24:15] All right. So now then the bank told me
[3:24:19] I'm trying to build your faith for
[3:24:20] something.
[3:24:21] So the bank told me uh well uh the money
[3:24:26] was sent by accident
[3:24:29] by the tailor.
[3:24:32] So you because you have spent it now
[3:24:36] we have considered it as a loan given to
[3:24:38] you.
[3:24:41] I said but I never asked for a loan.
[3:24:44] Don't worry there is no profit.
[3:24:48] You'll just pay it. I said but I can't
[3:24:51] find this lamb.
[3:24:53] He said no problem.
[3:24:56] &gt;&gt; Whatever you put
[3:24:58] we shall take.
[3:25:00] If you don't put we shall wait.
[3:25:06] So I diverted all the money on my other
[3:25:08] account
[3:25:12] for a period of time and whatever I
[3:25:15] allowed it to go there
[3:25:18] was going to the penance of the Lord God
[3:25:21] gave me
[3:25:24] until I paid it off.
[3:25:28] So friends, God is able to do miracles.
[3:25:33] Miracles are possible
[3:25:36] but we have to move by faith
[3:25:39] and not by sign.
[3:25:41] So we appreciate all the people standing
[3:25:43] with us
[3:25:46] and um those of you who are members of
[3:25:48] the church
[3:25:49] are not doing anything yet.
[3:25:53] Uh please come and do something
[3:25:58] be a member in one of the groups
[3:26:01] group leaders. Please stand on your
[3:26:03] feet.
[3:26:05] Please stand so they can see you.
[3:26:08] Look around.
[3:26:11] Look around. So if you're not a member
[3:26:13] of any group,
[3:26:16] see one of these people,
[3:26:19] brother Iran, Monica, Monica, sister,
[3:26:24] sister, sister Esther, Sister Shem,
[3:26:28] &gt;&gt; and brother sister. So meet them.
[3:26:31] brother
[3:26:33] and one of them and and tell them to put
[3:26:37] your name there so that you can
[3:26:39] contribute the little you can in a week
[3:26:44] and I can assure you church.
[3:26:47] We already have that land
[3:26:51] and we are going to build a church
[3:26:52] there.
[3:26:55] Actually I met a few brothers. I have a
[3:26:56] very wild thought.
[3:27:00] It is very wild my brother.
[3:27:04] &gt;&gt; I don't know whether you want to call.
[3:27:07] It's a thought about what we are going
[3:27:09] to do after
[3:27:12] but I can tell you we're going to build
[3:27:14] there
[3:27:16] and I know I've had a lot of temporary I
[3:27:19] feel like we're going to build a
[3:27:21] permanent
[3:27:25] right away.
[3:27:28] [Music]
[3:27:34] God gives you according to your faith.
[3:27:40] Well, the rest is over to you, church.
[3:27:42] Let's believe that God is more than able
[3:27:46] to do this. You know, you're here 80,
[3:27:50] 90, 100,
[3:27:52] but I tell you,
[3:27:54] people have things which are finished.
[3:27:57] [Music]
[3:27:59] you will see them coming afterwards
[3:28:02] [Music]
[3:28:04] by hundreds.
[3:28:06] That's why I don't know why but that's
[3:28:07] why.
[3:28:10] But those of us who are here on the
[3:28:11] foundation struggle
[3:28:14] looks like it is impossible.
[3:28:16] But don't look at what we are looking at
[3:28:17] now. Look at where we are heading.
[3:28:21] And this goal is achievable.
[3:28:24] So God bless you saints. We are
[3:28:26] dismissed.
[3:28:27] We'll meet on Wednesday
[3:28:29] at 6 p.m.
[3:28:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Shalom. God bless you.

[3:28:38] so precious to me.

[3:30:22] Afraid
[3:30:24] of Jesus.
[3:30:27] Oh, what a place
[3:30:31] that one so val.

[3:30:43] rain like this to lead me to the sky?
