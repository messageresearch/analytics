[1:17:50] i went to earned pasta
[1:17:55] [Music]
[1:17:57] to tell him
[1:17:59] that you know what
[1:18:01] i've gotten a job and
[1:18:03] going i think it was the following day
[1:18:07] because
[1:18:08] i have an angle in
[1:18:11] aunties were like you're not going to do
[1:18:13] interviews that
[1:18:15] you're just going straight
[1:18:21] when i told pastor
[1:18:24] discouraged me
[1:18:26] told me
[1:18:28] about the army especially there
[1:18:32] then i gave a second thought
[1:18:37] but she was like you can join but
[1:18:42] i mean i don't
[1:18:45] don't encourage you
[1:18:49] but
[1:18:50] the family was so much on me you have to
[1:18:53] get a job
[1:18:57] and indeed lacking a job uh prevented me
[1:19:00] from going to certain steps in life that
[1:19:03] i wanted
[1:19:10] but i listened to pastor's advice
[1:19:14] and
[1:19:16] i i did not join
[1:19:19] the family called it misbehaving
[1:19:25] but
[1:19:26] we pray and i believe god is a job
[1:19:32] that's a month
[1:19:34] i applied for a job
[1:19:36] they called me for interviews

[1:19:57] will inform you when to pick their
[1:19:59] appointment and debt of reporting

[1:20:13] then
[1:20:14] this week they called me for an
[1:20:16] appointment i signed an appointment and
[1:20:18] reported to work
[1:20:25] the good thing again in it is that
