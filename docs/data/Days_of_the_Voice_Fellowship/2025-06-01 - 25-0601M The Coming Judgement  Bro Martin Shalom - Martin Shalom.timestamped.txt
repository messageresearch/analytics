[37:52] fearful.
[37:54] The airship seemed so small in the
[37:58] waves and the winds kept blowing
[38:03] harder. Yet they were still so
[38:08] safe. Out of the dark he came
[38:13] walking. He had never lost them from
[38:17] view. He can see through the darkest of
[38:22] troules.
[38:23] You just wanted them to sit
[38:28] too. You never be filthy or
[38:32] empty until you're broken. You never
[38:37] behold until the potter has dried your
[38:42] vessel with fire. You may never come
[38:45] forth as pure gold.
[38:48] [Music]
[38:49] I didn't know how much he loved
[38:53] me till I passed through the storm and
[38:56] looked
[38:58] back. I didn't know Jesus was all that I
[39:03] needed. He was all that I

[1:31:32] talking

[1:32:07] has sent
[1:32:09] greetings. But what I know maybe wanted
[1:32:11] to send his greetings
[1:32:13] [Music]
[1:32:14] Amen. Just pray for me this

[1:32:37] occupy the empty seat in front of
[1:32:41] you. not leave any
[1:32:44] space. Amen.
[1:32:47] Yeah. And also uh I would also want to
[1:32:50] pass
[1:32:52] this that always you should learn
[1:32:55] [Music]
[1:32:56] to first fill up this middle
[1:33:01] seat because this is direct where the
[1:33:03] pulpit
[1:33:05] is and then maybe those who happen to
[1:33:08] come
[1:33:10] late they can occupy the other side.
[1:33:15] Praise be to
[1:33:16] God. And we should also learn to sit
[1:33:18] where the fire
[1:33:22] is. Amen.
[1:33:24] Yeah. When I was
[1:33:26] growing, I always loved to sit where to
[1:33:30] sit on the amen
[1:33:34] corners. Blessed be the
[1:33:36] name. Yeah. But when you find yourself
[1:33:39] looking for a very quiet corner,
[1:33:46] May God bless you.
[1:33:49] Amen.
[1:33:51] Yeah. This morning I quite wonder where
[1:33:54] to start
[1:33:57] from. I had several thoughts of what I
[1:34:00] would want to talk
[1:34:03] about.
[1:34:08] Amen. But let us turn to our Bibles.
[1:34:13] You read with me. We're going to second
[1:34:15] Corinthians.
[1:34:31] Second Corinthians.

[1:34:45] Yeah. We're reading 2 Corinthians
[1:34:49] uh chapter
[1:34:51] 5. Uh we shall read the first
[1:34:59] verse and then we shall jump
[1:35:03] to to vers 9.

[1:35:33] Roman
[1:35:43] for Continue.
[1:36:11] to
[1:36:22] send. Amen.
[1:36:25] Precious Lord
[1:36:27] Jesus, we thank you for the word which
[1:36:29] we have
[1:36:31] read and we ask you to add your
[1:36:33] blessings upon your
[1:36:35] word. May the Holy Spirit, Father, who
[1:36:38] wrote this
[1:36:39] word because the Bible tells us that men
[1:36:43] of all who are inspired or moved by the
[1:36:47] Holy
[1:36:48] Ghost wrote the
[1:36:50] scripture. Heaven Father, may the same
[1:36:55] anointing, may the same Holy Spirit,
[1:36:58] take this word this
[1:36:59] morning and break it to us, Lord, in
[1:37:03] Christ Jesus.
[1:37:05] Amen. Amen. You may have your seat.
[1:37:09] Amen.
[1:37:14] Praise be to
[1:37:18] God. This morning,
[1:37:23] Uh, I want us to I want to preach about
[1:37:26] the coming
[1:37:32] judgment. Praise be to
[1:37:35] God. Uh, many times preach this kind of
[1:37:38] sermon
[1:37:39] outside
[1:37:45] evangelism. Amen.
[1:37:48] But today I felt led that we talk remind
[1:37:51] oursel about the coming judgment.
[1:37:57] Praise be to God.
[1:37:59] And I will call it judgment is
[1:38:04] coming because I wanted to sound more uh
[1:38:10] serious,
[1:38:12] quick. Praise be to God.
[1:38:15] The prophet preached someone alongside
[1:38:17] that
[1:38:20] line. There's a sermon called the
[1:38:22] oncoming
[1:38:26] storm. Praise be to God.
[1:38:29] And in that sermon he remind us about
[1:38:32] the oncoming
[1:38:34] storm and tells that there is a storm
[1:38:38] coming and that storm is going to hit
[1:38:41] each one of
[1:38:43] us. Blessed be the name of the
[1:38:46] Lord. But before the storm
[1:38:50] comes always there is a place of
[1:38:55] refuge. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:38:58] I remember that time when uh brother
[1:39:00] Julius was preaching about the
[1:39:04] refuge and I was uh I had the same
[1:39:11] thought and I remember I told brother
[1:39:14] Dan that hey the brother is preaching my
[1:39:18] sermon. Praise be to
[1:39:21] God. Amen. We are living in a very
[1:39:24] dangerous time.
[1:39:27] The world has come to the end of
[1:39:29] [Music]
[1:39:31] everything. Blessed be the name of the
[1:39:33] Lord. And many times as
[1:39:36] Christian we forget about
[1:39:39] this. Praise be to God. But today I want
[1:39:44] us to take a different
[1:39:47] angle and we talk about the judgment
[1:39:50] which is coming.
[1:39:53] God is going to judge this world
[1:39:58] someday and each one of us we will be
[1:40:03] there. Praise be to
[1:40:05] God. Amen. And we must prepare for the
[1:40:11] judgment. In whatever we are doing, we
[1:40:15] should not forget that there is a
[1:40:17] judgment
[1:40:19] coming and God is judgment is
[1:40:22] coming and you need to prepare
[1:40:26] yourself. Praise be to God. That
[1:40:29] judgment will not find you
[1:40:33] unaware. You are prepared. But when you
[1:40:37] are not
[1:40:38] prepared, brother, sister, you'll be
[1:40:41] caught
[1:40:43] unaware. Praise be to
[1:40:46] God. Amen. The prophet tells us every
[1:40:50] time we see a major
[1:40:53] prophet. That is a sign of God's
[1:40:57] judgment. It's a warning that the
[1:41:00] judgment is
[1:41:01] coming. Are you
[1:41:03] ready? Are you prepared this
[1:41:08] afternoon? Amen.
[1:41:11] Praise be to
[1:41:12] God. Amen. In a message the oncoming
[1:41:17] storm butam says always there have to be
[1:41:21] a
[1:41:23] preparation. Amen. We are lucky and we
[1:41:27] are blessed that we are living in a
[1:41:29] country where we don't have
[1:41:33] earthquake. We only have things like
[1:41:37] landslide and even in government they
[1:41:40] have minister who responsible for
[1:41:44] that disaster and unprepared in
[1:41:49] us. Praise be to God even God. Amen.
[1:41:54] Praise the
[1:41:56] Lord. So when such an instance of
[1:41:59] God the government will not tell the
[1:42:02] citizen
[1:42:04] You know, we not budget for that. We're
[1:42:06] not
[1:42:08] prepared. Minister of
[1:42:11] this entire
[1:42:14] ministry responsible for
[1:42:18] that. Praise be to
[1:42:20] God. Amen. Preparing for
[1:42:26] landslide. But in the nation or
[1:42:29] country which have adequate
[1:42:33] If they will
[1:42:34] announce, praise the Lord, they will
[1:42:38] measure its
[1:42:40] effect. They measure even the effect of
[1:42:42] the
[1:42:45] article. And they say this will be his
[1:42:49] magnitude and all the people around this
[1:42:52] area, the government will transfer them.
[1:42:56] They will shift them. Why? Because there
[1:43:00] is an earthquake coming.
[1:43:02] There is a tornado
[1:43:04] coming. There's a storm
[1:43:06] coming. Praise be to
[1:43:09] God. Amen. And this afternoon, I'm here
[1:43:14] to tell you that there is a judgment
[1:43:18] coming and that is God's
[1:43:21] judgment where everybody will
[1:43:25] appear. And where we have read here,
[1:43:28] Apostle Paul tells us,
[1:43:31] praise the Lord.
[1:43:33] Amen.
[1:43:40] in verses
[1:43:43] uh nine.
[1:43:57] [Music]

[1:44:03] 5 vers 9
[1:44:09] says, "For we must all

[1:45:08] Amen. Praise be to
[1:45:12] God. Praise the Lord.
[1:45:16] God is judgment is
[1:45:18] coming and the Lord is sending
[1:45:21] warning. He has been anchoring
[1:45:24] warning for all
[1:45:26] ages. Praise be to God. It is later than
[1:45:30] we
[1:45:32] think. Amen. There's no time to
[1:45:36] waste. There's no time to play
[1:45:39] church. There's no time to play around.
[1:45:42] This time is for seeking
[1:45:45] God. Hallelujah. It's time for applying
[1:45:48] the

[1:46:09] sermon which you're going to amen and
[1:46:12] amen but this sermon where you do self
[1:46:17] inventory you check
[1:46:20] yourself. Amen. And we are checking
[1:46:23] ourself this
[1:46:24] morning. Where are you

[1:47:14] me but today amen we are speaking about
[1:47:18] the coming
[1:47:20] judgment and I'm saying judgment is
[1:47:25] coming praise be to God if you look at
[1:47:29] the text on coming judgment

[1:47:40] well. Judgment is coming. But when we
[1:47:45] say you can all wake up. Praise be to
[1:47:49] God. This kind of

[1:53:23] judgment? I see brother the bride is not
[1:53:26] going through.
[1:53:29] Are you in that church
[1:53:33] triumphant? Have you received the Holy
[1:53:36] Ghost? Are you born
[1:53:41] again or you are
[1:53:47] presuming? Praise be to God. It is later
[1:53:50] than we
[1:53:51] think. There's no time for
[1:53:54] presuming whether you are saved or not.
[1:53:57] This is time to be
[1:54:01] sure. Yes. Don't venture without
[1:54:05] authority. Be sure that you are saved.
[1:54:09] Be sure that you received Christ. You
[1:54:11] had experience with God.
[1:54:17] Don't tell me, brother Martin, the other
[1:54:20] day I prayed and
[1:54:22] cried. So what?
[1:54:31] Mothers in labors they
[1:54:40] cry. Even people with worms in the
[1:54:42] stomach they
[1:54:46] cry. Stomach upset. Even those who have
[1:54:50] stomach upsets
[1:54:52] they also cry.
[1:54:56] Even those one feeling bad in the body.
[1:55:00] I'm feeling so bad
[1:55:02] here. The child is
[1:55:05] so for you. What is that which is hard
[1:55:07] on
[1:55:09] you? Be sure of what you are talking
[1:55:12] about in whatever you are doing. Just
[1:55:16] know there is a judgment
[1:55:19] coming. Praise be to God. When you are
[1:55:22] dodging
[1:55:23] church, don't
[1:55:25] forget. Remember judgment is coming.
[1:55:32] Praise be to God.
[1:55:36] When you are entering B.
[1:55:39] Yes sir. Remember there is a judgment
[1:55:48] coming when you're making your lies.
[1:55:51] Don't forget
[1:55:55] God is judgment is coming.
[1:55:59] Blessed be the name of the
[1:56:02] Lord. There is a judgment
[1:56:06] coming and everybody is going to be
[1:56:11] there. Everyone will be
[1:56:15] there. But what matters is here.
[1:56:19] Which side are you going to
[1:56:23] be? Are you going to be in the side of
[1:56:26] the people who are the side of the
[1:56:29] church or the side of the
[1:56:35] convict? Praise the Lord. But everyone
[1:56:38] is going to
[1:56:40] be. Yes sir. You will not send your
[1:56:45] representative. You will not send your
[1:56:47] lawyer.
[1:56:51] Praise be to God.
[1:56:55] In the earthly courts,
[1:56:58] you can give
[1:56:59] excuses and say, "I have bunch of
[1:57:04] lawyers. I'm going to send my lawyers to
[1:57:06] be
[1:57:11] there. You hear them. You see them.
[1:57:17] Praise be to
[1:57:23] God. I said my
[1:57:26] counsels and they come in smart
[1:57:30] suit. They're putting on sharp shoes,
[1:57:33] very clean shoes, holding
[1:57:37] file. A lawyer doesn't need to tell you
[1:57:39] that they are
[1:57:41] lawyers all the time. They have files.
[1:57:44] started
[1:57:46] low. Praise be to God.
[1:57:50] But in God's judgment,
[1:57:53] hallelujah. Amen. Everybody's going to
[1:57:56] stand
[1:57:57] alone. Everybody will appear
[1:58:01] there. The president of this
[1:58:04] country. He will not send his
[1:58:07] representative. He will not send his
[1:58:09] lawyers. He will not send prime
[1:58:12] minister. He will stand before the
[1:58:14] judgment seat of
[1:58:17] God.
[1:58:18] Amen. The king of
[1:58:20] England will send his lawyers. He will
[1:58:24] stand before the
[1:58:26] judgment pop of Rome, the soal
[1:58:31] vic. Praise be to God. He will not send
[1:58:34] the cardinals. He will not send the
[1:58:37] bishops. He will not send the sisters.
[1:58:41] No sir, he will stand before the
[1:58:44] judgment.
[1:58:52] Are you prepared?
[1:58:56] You better prepare now.
[1:59:00] It is too
[1:59:01] late. Yes,
[1:59:04] sir. Praise the
[1:59:07] Lord. God knows what you are thinking.
[1:59:13] He has a record about your
[1:59:15] life. He has a record about my
[1:59:18] life. Blessed be the name of the
[1:59:22] Lord. Amen. The Bible warns us that in
[1:59:26] latter
[1:59:27] days iniquity shall abound the l of
[1:59:33] shall. Amen. man form of
[1:59:38] godliness but they denying the power of
[1:59:41] God. We are living in those days where
[1:59:45] people on Sunday they never chose to go
[1:59:48] for
[1:59:53] parties. Praise be to God. They go for
[1:59:57] prom parties.
[2:00:05] You find them attending every
[2:00:10] birthday from January to
[2:00:13] December. Their calendar is marked all
[2:00:23] over. Brother Martin, is it bad to
[2:00:26] attend
[2:00:28] Bapt? No, it's not
[2:00:32] bad. But if you might miss
[2:00:36] church, miss service because you're
[2:00:39] going to attend such
[2:00:41] parties. It is a
[2:00:47] sin. You don't miss baby
[2:00:55] showers, but you miss church.
[2:01:03] Praise be to God.
[2:01:07] Amen.
[2:01:11] Judgment is coming.
[2:01:17] You see even God
[2:01:19] himself he could not never thought of a
[2:01:25] man how can a man really face my
[2:01:33] judgment. Praise be to God. You know God
[2:01:37] is a righteous
[2:01:38] judge. Praise be to God.
[2:01:42] Even God
[2:01:43] himself when he thought of his
[2:01:46] judgment, he had to send his son,
[2:01:52] he had to send
[2:01:55] Christ to come and pay a ransom.
[2:02:02] Praise the
[2:02:05] Lord. Many time wait until we reach
[2:02:08] there.
[2:02:10] [Music]
[2:02:11] So uh they always tell us about this
[2:02:15] thing highminded.
[2:02:18] [Music]
[2:02:22] They think high
[2:02:23] things. I know
[2:02:25] all I know
[2:02:29] more. Praise be to God. You know
[2:02:32] nothing. Until you receive
[2:02:37] Christ. Amen. You are not in your right
[2:02:41] mind. No man is in his right mind until
[2:02:45] he receives Christ.
[2:02:47] [Music]
[2:02:49] Praise the Lord.
[2:02:53] I don't care whether you have
[2:02:55] PhD, whether you have DD, whether you
[2:02:58] have masters in
[2:03:00] psychology, you have
[2:03:02] PhD, in
[2:03:04] astrology, in medicine, not until you
[2:03:08] receive
[2:03:10] Christ, you are not in your right mind.
[2:03:16] Praise be to God.
[2:03:21] You've had
[2:03:22] issues. You've had issues.
[2:03:36] and want to first use so and so to
[2:03:44] speak
[2:03:46] really and these are
[2:03:48] men who are
[2:03:51] respected professor
[2:03:53] professor of Harvard
[2:04:01] of but they are coming on
[2:04:05] children their last bones.
[2:04:09] They want to use them for
[2:04:12] marks is because they not in their
[2:04:17] right. Praise be to
[2:04:20] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:04:25] There is a judgment
[2:04:28] coming. We've been warn of this
[2:04:31] judgment
[2:04:33] ages. The
[2:04:36] prophet, Amen, they were pointing us
[2:04:40] toward
[2:04:41] that says, Amen. that Jesus Christ in
[2:04:46] his
[2:04:47] ministry. He preached 80% of his
[2:04:51] sermon was about his second
[2:04:55] coming.
[2:05:00] 80%. Praise the
[2:05:03] Lord. Amen.
[2:05:06] Amen. Amen.
[2:05:10] And the grave gave up the dead which
[2:05:14] were in
[2:05:15] it. And death and
[2:05:18] hell delivered up the
[2:05:21] dead which were in
[2:05:24] them. And they were judged everyone
[2:05:27] according to their
[2:05:34] works. Praise be to God. Everybody was
[2:05:38] judged.
[2:05:41] according to their
[2:05:45] work. Many time forget about these
[2:05:49] things. But I want us to pinch our
[2:05:52] conscious this
[2:05:54] morning. Where are you standing
[2:05:57] tonight? Are you ready for the coming
[2:06:02] judgment? Have you passed the judgment
[2:06:05] to life?
[2:06:07] [Music]
[2:06:08] Are you in Christ
[2:06:11] Jesus? Amen. Because all in Christ
[2:06:16] Jesus, there's the only place of
[2:06:20] refuge. Because the Bible says,
[2:06:22] "Therefore, there's no
[2:06:25] condemnation. To those who are in Christ
[2:06:29] Jesus, praise the Lord." Are you in
[2:06:33] Christ this morning?
[2:06:36] Are you sure you are born
[2:06:38] again? Have you received the Holy
[2:06:40] Ghost? Have you received the message of
[2:06:42] the
[2:06:44] hour? Have you recognized your
[2:06:48] messenger and his
[2:06:50] message? Do you know what the message of
[2:06:52] the hour
[2:06:57] is? Praise be to
[2:07:01] God. Are you aware of the oncoming
[2:07:03] judgment?
[2:07:07] Are you
[2:07:09] prepared? Are you
[2:07:12] ready? Praise be to God.
[2:07:16] Amen.
[2:07:22] Judgment is coming.
[2:07:27] Let us
[2:07:29] run toward the mark of our
[2:07:32] calling which is in Christ
[2:07:36] Jesus. Jesus said in book of John
[2:07:40] 5:24, whosoever hears my
[2:07:43] word and
[2:07:45] believe in amen on him that sent
[2:07:49] me have everlasting
[2:07:52] life and will not come until judgment.
[2:07:58] Praise be to God. There are two group of
[2:08:01] people
[2:08:02] here. Those who are coming in the
[2:08:05] judgment, those who already
[2:08:07] judge, they already passed
[2:08:11] judgment. But they will also
[2:08:13] appear. But the advantage is they'll be
[2:08:17] on the judging
[2:08:20] side. Praise be to
[2:08:22] God. Because they were judged on
[2:08:25] us, they took he of the
[2:08:28] judgment, they repented of their sins.
[2:08:33] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And because they
[2:08:36] repented of their sins, there's no
[2:08:40] condemnation. You cannot be judged with
[2:08:44] tri. Praise the
[2:08:48] Lord. Amen.
[2:08:51] On this day,
[2:08:53] where John
[2:08:54] saw and Sarah saw the
[2:08:57] great and the
[2:09:03] small. That is the final
[2:09:09] judgment. Maybe you failed to get
[2:09:11] justice in the courts of
[2:09:16] Africa. Praise be to God.
[2:09:20] Amen. Amen. And because of that,
[2:09:25] you've just you've learned to live with
[2:09:26] me.
[2:09:30] Let us live with the little we have. The
[2:09:33] above have taken your
[2:09:37] land. The high ranking
[2:09:42] officials. Amen. The untouchables of
[2:09:45] this
[2:09:47] earth. And I think all is well.
[2:09:52] But I'm here to encourage you. It is not
[2:09:55] yet
[2:09:56] over. Amen. It is just for a
[2:10:01] season. But there is a coming
[2:10:03] judgment where the righteous
[2:10:06] judge of the judge is going to judge
[2:10:09] this
[2:10:10] world. and everybody,
[2:10:13] every minister minister of the
[2:10:15] government, every minister of the
[2:10:18] gospel, every member of
[2:10:21] parliament, members of
[2:10:24] Congress, they will appear before the
[2:10:28] judge and they will be
[2:10:32] judged. Praise the
[2:10:35] Lord. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:10:40] Praise be to God.
[2:10:43] But always there is a warning before the
[2:10:49] judgment. And the reason I asked why you
[2:10:51] are here this
[2:10:52] morning is because you heard the
[2:10:57] gospel and the minister told
[2:11:00] you. We are living in the end
[2:11:03] time and you went and believe the end
[2:11:06] time
[2:11:10] message. Praise be to God. But what have
[2:11:14] you
[2:11:15] done? Many message believers are so
[2:11:19] comforted. We are in the message. We are
[2:11:23] in the
[2:11:24] bride. Are you
[2:11:27] sure? Do you have the blood tag?
[2:11:32] talking applied there.
[2:11:37] It is true we are in the end
[2:11:42] time. But are you
[2:11:47] ready or it has become a
[2:11:52] slogan or a dogma in the
[2:11:56] message? There they say, "Hail Mary,
[2:11:59] mother of
[2:12:01] Jesus. Pray for us
[2:12:03] sinners." We are in the message. I'm the
[2:12:10] bride. We are in the message of the
[2:12:13] hour. I'm a message
[2:12:19] believer. My holy Mary, mother of
[2:12:21] Christ, pray for
[2:12:23] us like the other people.
[2:12:27] It is that dogman
[2:12:30] creed and there's another creed
[2:12:39] developing. Praise be to
[2:12:43] God. I belong to this
[2:12:52] church.
[2:12:59] Tabernacle thunder roaring
[2:13:07] tabernacle restored revelation.
[2:13:18] [Music]
[2:13:20] Capstone days of the
[2:13:24] voice. And every time you read the book
[2:13:26] of
[2:13:28] Revelation, and in the days of the
[2:13:30] voice, how you feel our
[2:13:36] children, hidden man
[2:13:39] tabernacle, hidden
[2:13:43] man. And when you think of that man,
[2:13:47] which is ever afraid. Just look at
[2:13:49] yourself
[2:13:50] there. You do whatever you want because
[2:13:53] you in
[2:13:55] manner you are
[2:13:59] deceiveful. Run to
[2:14:02] Christ. Are you in the
[2:14:05] church? Are you in the Savior's
[2:14:07] blood? What matters today?
[2:14:11] being in Savior's
[2:14:14] bride in the church to help
[2:14:19] us. Lord, let me be the church
[2:14:22] of let the savior's
[2:14:26] blood in the
[2:14:30] body and forever
[2:14:35] more. Oh, you are baptized in the
[2:14:37] message
[2:14:38] church. You are baptized in the message
[2:14:45] name. You see from put on long
[2:14:48] skirts and that settles
[2:14:51] it. You
[2:14:56] abuse. You are
[2:15:04] arrogant. You don't want correction.
[2:15:09] How dare he talk about me? Even at
[2:15:13] work, people
[2:15:16] respect. Even my
[2:15:18] boss praise me
[2:15:23] carefully. How dare
[2:15:26] him. That young man there. He's just he
[2:15:29] has just started to preach. He's also
[2:15:32] preaching about
[2:15:35] closing. How dare him. talk about
[2:15:38] marriage even if no
[2:15:43] marriage repent when
[2:15:48] if you have that
[2:15:52] attitude the same
[2:15:55] Christ the same
[2:15:57] anointing which was upon that
[2:16:00] message is the same
[2:16:03] anointing upon that preacher
[2:16:08] Praise be to God.
[2:16:14] You
[2:16:16] expect it's like you're expecting me.
[2:16:22] Oh, you are expecting my brother Sam.
[2:16:26] His voice to be like my
[2:16:30] voice. But he's growing.
[2:16:33] With the time, we have big
[2:16:36] voice. We grow in
[2:16:39] Christ. Praise be to God. Blessed be the
[2:16:43] name of the Lord. Church, are you
[2:16:46] prepared? Do you know that judgment is
[2:16:51] coming? Do you know that God is
[2:16:54] gathering
[2:16:57] evidence? There is an eye washing
[2:17:01] you. Wherever you go, whatever you do,
[2:17:05] whatever you say, there is a
[2:17:09] recorder. God is recording
[2:17:13] you. Praise be to
[2:17:16] God. God must have enough
[2:17:21] evidence. Amen.
[2:17:27] He won't just judge you anyhow. I saw
[2:17:30] that kind of
[2:17:31] [Music]
[2:17:33] judge. The judges who receive a
[2:17:37] call and they twist the
[2:17:40] case. I remember one time my uncle was
[2:17:44] knocked
[2:17:47] around. So the man who knocked
[2:17:52] him, he was related
[2:17:56] to he was related to one of the
[2:17:59] superintendent of uh I think
[2:18:06] hospital and when the case was taken to
[2:18:10] ginger police.
[2:18:14] Praise be to
[2:18:16] God. And what
[2:18:19] happened just after two three
[2:18:22] days the statement had
[2:18:25] changed. The man who was
[2:18:29] knocked and this time he broke like two
[2:18:36] times. Some bones were crashed.
[2:18:45] I remember when I looked at the
[2:18:48] X-ray, some
[2:18:50] bones were just
[2:18:54] collected. They were bind with binding
[2:18:58] wires and they put them
[2:19:01] back up to today still having implant in
[2:19:04] his
[2:19:06] name. And what happened?
[2:19:09] The file was
[2:19:15] twisted that instead of the person who
[2:19:19] knocked him to take care of his
[2:19:23] bill, they asked
[2:19:29] us to pay the man, compensate the man
[2:19:36] repair his
[2:19:40] car, his
[2:19:42] car, but there is life dying at
[2:19:49] the praise be to God. Look at such
[2:19:56] injustice. I'm not a
[2:19:58] politician, but this is reality.
[2:20:04] Life and car. Which one?
[2:20:09] Evil
[2:20:09] men full of
[2:20:19] demons. They think that office
[2:20:23] they are
[2:20:24] holding will stand before the judgment
[2:20:26] of
[2:20:30] God. Praise the Lord.
[2:20:34] But there's a day
[2:20:35] coming they will give an
[2:20:38] account unless they
[2:20:42] repent. Those are the very men whom you
[2:20:46] find out
[2:20:47] there trying to arrest
[2:20:53] preachers. You are ching noise
[2:20:55] pollution. Noise
[2:21:00] pollution. But let me tell
[2:21:04] you, there's crying in
[2:21:07] hell. There was no noise
[2:21:10] pollution. You better listen to the
[2:21:12] voice of the
[2:21:15] preacher. Amen. And repent.
[2:21:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:21:26] Praise the Lord.
[2:21:29] So we were in that kind of
[2:21:32] condition. Now what
[2:21:35] happened? This ankle of
[2:21:38] mine, his landlord was a soldier.
[2:21:45] He went and followed the
[2:21:49] file and he told
[2:21:52] them when I come back
[2:21:55] here I will come in another in another
[2:22:01] version. They started figing looking for
[2:22:06] fire. Where is it? Where is it?
[2:22:11] Whoever was sitted on the file had to
[2:22:13] bring it out. Immediately receive
[2:22:16] call from from uh from the uh from the
[2:22:20] people who had knocked
[2:22:24] us. But we
[2:22:26] said the man is there. They're going to
[2:22:28] work on
[2:22:29] him calls again. Why do they waited for
[2:22:34] for God's
[2:22:35] eyes? Why do you wait to
[2:22:45] reach and just within two three
[2:22:48] days they taken him to theater worked on

[2:23:42] country. When he calls for
[2:23:49] you, no matter how big you are, no one
[2:23:53] rebels.
[2:23:58] They will hold you before your
[2:24:03] children. Sir at that
[2:24:08] moment, even if you make how many calls,
[2:24:11] when the president of this country calls
[2:24:15] me, even if you have battalions of
[2:24:23] army, again.
[2:24:29] They know your cup is full. But I'm here
[2:24:32] to tell you this. There is above above

[2:25:37] behind. He even knows your thoughts
[2:25:39] right now. He knows what you are
[2:25:42] thinking. He knows what you did
[2:25:44] yesterday. He knows what you spoke in
[2:25:46] the

[2:26:06] attitude negative
[2:26:08] thought is in
[2:26:14] that. Praise be to
[2:26:17] God. His eyes sees everything.
[2:26:21] It is
[2:26:22] everywhere in season and under
[2:26:25] beneath. Until one day when that
[2:26:28] revelation strike came, he said, "Where
[2:26:31] can I hide? Even if I lay my bed in the
[2:26:35] earth, there God
[2:26:39] is. Praise be to
[2:26:42] God. Amen. Amen.
[2:26:52] Praise the
[2:26:54] Lord. I want to take a quote
[2:27:02] here. I've
[2:27:06] got blessed be the name of the
[2:27:10] Lord. Today we think we are smart.
[2:27:16] Yeah. is a smart
[2:27:19] generation. Smart phone, smart switch,
[2:27:23] smart car, smart everything, smart
[2:27:31] TV. Do you know that you can put this
[2:27:33] light without pressing the the
[2:27:38] switch? You just press a
[2:27:41] button and then you put this one off.
[2:27:45] You can drive. There are cars which can
[2:27:47] be which can be drive
[2:27:50] without
[2:27:53] staring. And that made people think that
[2:27:55] they are so
[2:27:57] smart that they can even come to
[2:28:00] church and hide their
[2:28:02] sin. They think so smart.
[2:28:19] that even God cannot see
[2:28:21] [Music]
[2:28:26] it. Blessed be the name
[2:28:30] of Amen.
[2:28:33] Can you go up a little bit?
[2:28:36] [Music]
[2:28:39] You paragraph
[2:28:50] 171. Praise be to God. So in a smart
[2:28:55] generation until they think even the
[2:28:58] Holy Ghost, they're going to receive him
[2:29:01] in a smart way.
[2:29:05] If there is a receiving of the Holy
[2:29:07] Ghost in a smart
[2:29:09] way, then there is smart birth.
[2:29:27] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:29:31] Amen.
[2:29:36] There's something here in
[2:29:41] Revelation where Bernam
[2:29:43] was describing
[2:29:46] [Music]
[2:29:48] Jesus. Blessed be the name of
[2:29:52] He was telling
[2:29:55] us how his eyes will be
[2:30:00] on the judgment
[2:30:03] day. Blessed be the name
[2:30:10] of his desript his
[2:30:14] description as a judge.
[2:30:18] Praise be to God. and wait on
[2:30:21] judgment. He's not going to be the
[2:30:25] lamb. He is coming as a
[2:30:29] judge. Mercy will be
[2:30:32] over. Amen. Mercy will be
[2:30:37] finished. Yes
[2:30:40] sir. Either you meet him today as a
[2:30:43] bleeding
[2:30:45] lamb or you will receive him or you meet
[2:30:49] him
[2:30:50] as a
[2:30:51] judge on the day of
[2:30:54] judgment. But what you should know,
[2:30:58] judgment is
[2:31:01] coming and is very
[2:31:07] close. Praise the Lord.
[2:31:10] When Jesus started his
[2:31:12] preaching, he said, the Bible tells us
[2:31:15] that when Jesus heard John was given, he
[2:31:19] started he had been
[2:31:21] arrested, he started to preach the
[2:31:24] gospel telling them to repent because
[2:31:27] the kingdom of God
[2:31:30] was.
[2:31:34] Amen. So the judgment is very close.
[2:31:38] We have received the seventh
[2:31:40] angel. We have received the warning.
[2:31:44] Behold, I send
[2:31:46] Elijah. Amen. With a message to turn our
[2:31:51] hearts back first to our
[2:31:54] fathers. Less he comes and smile the
[2:31:58] world with
[2:32:00] God. Praise be to God. Remember one time
[2:32:04] our pastor preached on sermon.
[2:32:06] say that the message still
[2:32:11] comes but not to
[2:32:14] everybody to those who receive the
[2:32:16] message of Malachi
[2:32:20] 4.
[2:32:23] Amen. Blessed be the name of the
[2:32:30] Lord. What is
[2:32:33] coming is terrible.
[2:32:36] until the Bible says, "Why do you want
[2:32:40] the day of the
[2:32:46] Lord?" Why are you waiting for the day
[2:32:48] of the
[2:32:50] Lord? It will be a fearful
[2:32:54] day. The Bible explains
[2:32:56] it. says it to look like a
[2:33:00] man that ran out of the
[2:33:03] bear and made a lion and he ran out of
[2:33:07] lion and
[2:33:09] ran and entered the house and held on
[2:33:12] the
[2:33:13] wall and the snake beat
[2:33:16] him. That is the day of the Lord.
[2:33:22] And if we are not
[2:33:25] careful that
[2:33:28] day will caught us
[2:33:33] unaware. Blessed be the name
[2:33:36] of God is not going to judge us
[2:33:40] anyhow. God has
[2:33:44] evidence. Praise be to
[2:33:47] God. He has been recording your life.
[2:33:52] ever since you were born.
[2:33:58] And the Bible tells us of the
[2:34:00] devil, he calls him a chooser of
[2:34:05] brethren. He's ever following you
[2:34:09] [Applause]
[2:34:10] also. He also has his record.
[2:34:16] Yes, sir.
[2:34:19] Amen.
[2:34:23] There must be somebody to be there
[2:34:26] to give
[2:34:28] witness doing those things,
[2:34:32] sinning, stealing,
[2:34:35] bewitching,
[2:34:38] lying. There must be a
[2:34:41] witness. Amen. The eyes of the Lord
[2:34:45] Jesus sees you everywhere you go.
[2:34:50] The Bible tells us his eyes move all
[2:34:53] over the
[2:34:54] earth and flow.
[2:34:57] There is
[2:34:59] nothing that's going to
[2:35:04] hide on the day of
[2:35:07] judgment. Blessed be the name of the
[2:35:10] Lord
[2:35:11] Jesus. That day is coming.
[2:35:18] The records will be
[2:35:20] produced. There will be no court of
[2:35:26] appeal. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:35:32] That day is
[2:35:36] coming. Brother,
[2:35:39] sister, why don't you make yourself
[2:35:42] right
[2:35:44] before? Why don't you receive the Holy
[2:35:46] Ghost?
[2:35:48] Why do you see
[2:35:50] God still here?
[2:35:56] Praise be to
[2:36:02] God. You want deacons to look for
[2:36:06] you. Brother
[2:36:07] X, where are you? Oh, my
[2:36:12] brother, I'm very far. Where exactly?

[2:37:19] angel. Whatever you
[2:37:24] do, the angel is
[2:37:27] [Music]
[2:37:29] recording. That eye is
[2:37:34] watching. Did you go to the neighbors?
[2:37:39] Did you go to the neighbors?
[2:37:42] I didn't go there. I've been here the
[2:37:43] whole day.
[2:37:47] Are you sure?
[2:37:49] Yes. But
[2:37:51] remember, there is a day called
[2:37:57] judgment. And that day, you will not
[2:38:01] hide in your mother's
[2:38:05] garment. Mommy, mommy,
[2:38:08] mommy, even mommy will also be running.
[2:38:18] Daddy, that day we are going to appear
[2:38:22] before the great battle.
[2:38:29] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:38:35] Amen.
[2:38:36] And we are going to be judged
[2:38:40] the whole world.
[2:38:42] will watch the news that
[2:38:45] day. There'll be one big
[2:38:49] screen.
[2:38:50] Hallelujah. And that's when we are going
[2:38:53] to see
[2:38:55] stories. That's when men will
[2:38:59] know. That out of the 15 children is
[2:39:04] having only had one.
[2:39:12] Hallelujah.
[2:39:14] That is when believers will
[2:39:17] wonder. You will see a
[2:39:20] brother who if he's receive the Holy
[2:39:24] Ghost bewishing the
[2:39:28] [Music]
[2:39:34] pastor. We will see our sisters
[2:39:41] when they come to
[2:39:42] church, scouts her
[2:39:45] down. We will see stories.
[2:39:52] Brother, she lives home with a
[2:39:56] bag. The

[2:40:01] kilome where he knows the neighbors does

[2:40:06] The last person who know my mother or
[2:40:08] who knows
[2:40:09] me that I come from shalom
[2:40:12] family is
[2:40:15] there. So after his building is
[2:40:18] block go in the washroom
[2:40:23] in

[2:41:10] balms. You put the artificial
[2:41:14] nails. You remove the tinkling
[2:41:18] shoes. You enter the

[2:42:12] sin. We are hammering that
[2:42:16] devil. We want you to be born
[2:42:20] again because judgment is
[2:42:22] coming where he will not run
[2:42:26] anywhere. Praise be to God. And while
[2:42:29] you are doing that, the devil is
[2:42:32] recording. The devil always record bad
[2:42:37] things. When he sees brother Julius
[2:42:39] sagging

[2:42:49] brother. Oh, brother M speak

[2:42:59] it. There are two libraries, mind
[2:43:03] you. God's
[2:43:05] library and the devil's library. Why are
[2:43:08] they reging
[2:43:10] this? Because there's a devil
[2:43:13] judgment and evilness must be
[2:43:15] produced. God is a court of
[2:43:20] judgment. Amen. God is a righteous
[2:43:24] judge. He's a just
[2:43:27] judge. Yes, sir. He must have
[2:43:32] enough. Praise be to God. And you are at
[2:43:36] the
[2:43:37] table. He's also having
[2:43:41] his recording.
[2:43:45] Praise be to God. After sister worked on
[2:43:48] her
[2:43:50] soul, then she goes to preach the
[2:43:52] devil's
[2:43:56] gospel. She goes
[2:43:58] there. Then they starting on us.
[2:44:06] Cheeky
[2:44:10] chick. Look at the
[2:44:15] babe. If they call a big
[2:44:18] man, how can you call my
[2:44:27] wife? Do you
[2:44:30] know? They put on pumpers sometime,
[2:44:34] others they they drip with with saliva.
[2:44:43] [Music]
[2:44:52] when they could feel,
[2:44:56] "Oh, you swap baby with bride of Christ.
[2:45:02] [Music]
[2:45:04] You swap son of God with
[2:45:08] [Music]
[2:45:13] and you feel
[2:45:15] [Music]
[2:45:19] like you which kind of
[2:45:27] blood or Christ's
[2:45:31] blood the devil is recording.
[2:45:35] You go to campass
[2:45:37] after you've done
[2:45:39] everything then when you are coming
[2:45:45] back. Let me give you let me give you a
[2:45:49] story. When I was in
[2:45:52] Oliver, our school used to put on short
[2:45:59] Just imagine a big man like
[2:46:03] me putting on
[2:46:07] shorten that was unfair. It
[2:46:09] was even some school I
[2:46:13] think but if you follow the story about
[2:46:16] that because they don't want to think
[2:46:18] that you are you at the same level with
[2:46:20] teachers.
[2:46:25] So you only put on trouser when you when
[2:46:27] you are in A
[2:46:29] level. So you also work very
[2:46:32] hard so that you cross to A
[2:46:35] level. Just imagine you know there are
[2:46:38] some school
[2:46:40] boys in high schools. You find him in
[2:46:44] senior
[2:46:45] one. You find the person is in form one
[2:46:49] but he's calling a married woman.
[2:46:53] But when it comes with this
[2:46:57] short you
[2:47:01] [Music]
[2:47:03] say blessed be the name of so I remember
[2:47:07] one
[2:47:08] Saturday I said I'm tired of this thing
[2:47:11] today I'm not going to put on I carried
[2:47:14] two two I carried a to a
[2:47:17] shop because I think it was a weekend or
[2:47:21] it was kind of a sporting
[2:47:25] Praise be to God. So I went and put it
[2:47:28] on my
[2:47:29] trouser. When I was about to reach
[2:47:30] school, I removed it being that the
[2:47:34] other one was a
[2:47:36] short. So it was inside the
[2:47:41] truth, I went and hide my
[2:47:44] trophy in a
[2:47:47] bush in a
[2:47:49] cava that if it rains,
[2:47:53] Guess what happened?
[2:47:55] I think somebody saw
[2:47:59] me. It was my new
[2:48:03] trouser. When I was coming
[2:48:05] back, I shake the whole
[2:48:13] bush. I was like looking for
[2:48:16] grasshoppers, but my trouser was gone.
[2:48:21] What am I trying to
[2:48:23] say? You know your
[2:48:25] position where you always do your
[2:48:27] makeups
[2:48:31] from you know
[2:48:34] yourself. Praise be to God. But let me
[2:48:36] hope you are not here. One day you'll
[2:48:40] enter
[2:48:41] that. You find one when
[2:48:43] pastor or ministers in your
[2:48:46] church or your
[2:48:48] father has come to buy
[2:48:53] something you'll get
[2:48:55] out in hell's
[2:48:59] tune surprise my
[2:49:02] daughter be
[2:49:03] careful will kill your
[2:49:06] dad
[2:49:07] pressure can kill him down
[2:49:12] at someone someone has already recorded
[2:49:16] it. It is recorded and the tape is
[2:49:22] kept. Praise be to
[2:49:27] God. It's recorded.
[2:49:30] [Music]
[2:49:33] You come back, you remove the nails, you
[2:49:36] change the the
[2:49:39] dressing, there's judgment
[2:49:41] come. You come here, you even sing
[2:49:45] special and judge
[2:49:51] Christ. You are
[2:49:53] consoled instead of
[2:49:56] repenting. You just repent
[2:49:58] that you will it will find you on the
[2:50:01] day of judgment.
[2:50:05] Yes
[2:50:08] sir. Praise be to God.
[2:50:19] Amen. Judgment is coming.

[2:50:30] said was as white like a
[2:50:33] wool, as white as
[2:50:35] snow. His eyes were flames of
[2:50:39] fire, whose eyes, the eyes of
[2:50:44] Christ, the eyes of the
[2:50:48] church, the same
[2:50:50] eyes which was wept.

[2:51:17] head was as white as
[2:51:21] snow and he say that head
[2:51:24] hair eyes were like the flame of
[2:51:27] fire. Think of
[2:51:30] it those eyes were once teamed with
[2:51:33] human
[2:51:35] tears now has become flame of
[2:51:39] fire in anger.
[2:51:42] He stands there as angry
[2:51:47] judge. Why didn't why did he reject
[2:51:52] him? Oh
[2:51:54] sinner. Think of

[2:52:02] it. Think of
[2:52:08] it. Amen. Amen.
[2:52:11] You are just
[2:52:13] lukewarm. You are

[2:52:21] don't know that you are
[2:52:23] lukewarm, not what, not
[2:52:27] cold, not a believer, not an
[2:52:32] unbeliever, not a
[2:52:39] scavenger. Praise be to
[2:52:42] God. Catholic Baptist Presbyterian.
[2:52:47] Let me say this message
[2:52:52] believers. Think of
[2:52:55] it. Says, "You are Virgin Mary." He was
[2:53:00] speaking to Catholics.
[2:53:03] But I'm speaking to message
[2:53:05] believers. You are our virgin Mary.
[2:53:10] Yes, she was virgin. She was our sister.
[2:53:14] Our sister
[2:53:16] virgin. The prophet says had gone up to
[2:53:20] Pentecost
[2:53:22] and received the Holy Ghost and stagger
[2:53:26] and act like a
[2:53:29] drunk intellectual
[2:53:32] brothers. You can't even open your
[2:53:36] mouth and
[2:53:42] worship. Praise be to
[2:53:46] God. You can't even
[2:53:49] jump. It's like you're standing
[2:53:55] on. When a song leader sing and say we
[2:54:01] jump brother
[2:54:04] jump sister jump.
[2:54:08] How are you convincing
[2:54:10] God? If you're saying I'm
[2:54:15] jumping and you're not
[2:54:18] jumping. Is that sincerity?
[2:54:23] You are
[2:54:24] presuming that you are doing the right
[2:54:27] thing. The moment a song stands here is
[2:54:31] the one commanding the army.
[2:54:34] Hallelujah to receive marching
[2:54:38] order. The arm of the
[2:54:40] Lord the Lord's
[2:54:45] army. Yes sir.
[2:54:50] Hallelujah. The command is giving
[2:54:52] marching
[2:54:54] order. The soldier is dozing.
[2:55:01] If you're a young
[2:55:02] man and you do those in the
[2:55:05] service, hear
[2:55:08] this. You go to
[2:55:10] army, join that army and those when the
[2:55:14] commander is
[2:55:24] speak. Amen. Amen. Christ is saying
[2:55:29] attention everybody has to
[2:55:32] be that
[2:55:37] is hallelujah.
[2:55:40] Praise be to God.
[2:55:42] Have you ever seen when the soldiers are
[2:55:46] marching it's uniform
[2:55:50] march? Amen.
[2:55:53] But sometime in
[2:55:55] church you wonder is this a
[2:55:59] soldier or is a
[2:56:10] defense. Praise be to
[2:56:17] God. Praise the Lord.
[2:56:22] When we say we go
[2:56:24] forward, you are going backward. Look
[2:56:27] church
[2:56:28] member every day. You are looking every
[2:56:31] week. Every year you have a problem.
[2:56:36] There is a problem somewhere else. You
[2:56:39] need the Holy Ghost.
[2:56:45] Amen. Amen.
[2:56:50] Judgment is coming.
[2:56:53] Only those who have the Holy
[2:56:55] Spirit, they are the one going to be on
[2:56:58] the judging
[2:56:59] side. Blessed be the name
[2:57:02] of Mary
[2:57:08] Stagard. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise
[2:57:11] be to God. I was so one of them. Mary
[2:57:16] was not one of them. Until you receive
[2:57:18] the Holy Ghost, how do you know that
[2:57:20] you're one of
[2:57:22] them? Not until you receive the Holy
[2:57:25] Ghost. If you have not received the Holy
[2:57:27] Ghost, you are not
[2:57:30] sure whether you are serpent seed or
[2:57:36] not. You better be
[2:57:39] sure. Whose child are
[2:57:42] you? Which city are you?
[2:57:48] Yes. He said the serpent seed will not
[2:57:50] receive the Holy
[2:57:54] Spirit. Praise be to
[2:57:57] God. Amen.
[2:58:00] Amen. There is a guy recording my
[2:58:04] brother. Evidence must be
[2:58:07] produced on the
[2:58:11] judgment. Yes sir.
[2:58:16] You at home backbiting pastor,
[2:58:20] the guy is recording.
[2:58:23] Put it in the
[2:58:25] bag. And when you're coming to church,
[2:58:28] the first person to
[2:58:31] meet God bless
[2:58:33] you. God bless you. Our
[2:58:37] pastor, pastor. You know the way you
[2:58:40] anointed. I just look at you. I received
[2:58:43] the
[2:58:46] touch. This is recorded.
[2:58:50] Oh, amen. My brother, thanks for loving
[2:58:52] the
[2:58:53] message. Oh, pastor, thank you. Thank
[2:58:56] you for an
[2:58:58] encouragement. Yesterday you
[2:59:02] fornicated. If I was you, I would say,
[2:59:06] "Pastor, pray for me.
[2:59:08] I don't love the message but I want to
[2:59:10] love it because even yesterday things
[2:59:14] went
[2:59:17] wrong. Luke home church
[2:59:20] [Music]
[2:59:23] member the very mother of Christ had to
[2:59:26] get that
[2:59:28] before she would be permitted to heaven.
[2:59:37] How are you? How are you women going to
[2:59:40] get
[2:59:41] there? Anything less than that? Think of
[2:59:45] it, men. Each of
[2:59:48] you, his hair and his
[2:59:51] eyes dim with
[2:59:53] tears. Yet, I want you to notice
[2:59:58] something.
[2:59:59] Amen.
[3:00:01] Those eyes when he was once on earth,
[3:00:05] yet they were deemed with tears like a
[3:00:08] man. For he cried at the
[3:00:11] grave, cried full full of
[3:00:14] sympathy his
[3:00:16] humanity. He was
[3:00:18] closed. He was closed with
[3:00:21] humanity in order to take
[3:00:24] away. And he had behind that human. He
[3:00:28] had something behind him that could look
[3:00:30] right
[3:00:32] down that could look right down in the
[3:00:35] hearts of
[3:00:37] men. And we know about
[3:00:40] him. Why? There is something
[3:00:44] behind the eye of
[3:00:47] Christ looks deep into your
[3:00:50] heart. The word of God is sharper than
[3:00:52] two.
[3:00:55] He goes deep. He separated
[3:00:59] thoughts.
[3:01:01] Amen. Yet he was closed with mortal
[3:01:07] flesh. Brother,
[3:01:09] sister that I is
[3:01:11] watching, that I has been
[3:01:14] following. Amen. Don't
[3:01:17] forget that the judgment is
[3:01:21] coming. Amen. the eye of
[3:01:24] Christ and looks even through the
[3:01:28] grave and look through every
[3:01:30] heart every word.
[3:01:36] Sometime children hide things which even
[3:01:37] parents don't
[3:01:38] [Applause]
[3:01:41] know. But hear this
[3:01:43] today that I looks through your
[3:01:48] wardrobe inside your
[3:01:50] suitcase and sees
[3:01:55] that
[3:01:56] I
[3:01:58] recorded you the other day when you
[3:02:02] boyfriend
[3:02:05] When you hugging that
[3:02:08] girl, you were
[3:02:13] recorded. Praise be to God. That eye of
[3:02:17] Christ saw you the other day when you
[3:02:21] are putting on those big
[3:02:26] kisses. Judgment is
[3:02:29] coming. Run for your life.
[3:02:36] God recorded it. The devil recorded
[3:02:40] it. Remember, each one of us will
[3:02:46] appear. Yes,
[3:02:49] sir. He knows what you're
[3:02:51] thinking. He knows even your next step
[3:02:54] after
[3:02:56] here. Even what you are saying in your
[3:03:00] heart. But these people they go far it
[3:03:03] is
[3:03:09] recorded even it is even
[3:03:14] when I'm about to
[3:03:19] finish. Praise be to God. Every thought
[3:03:23] is recorded. The Bible tells us in
[3:03:26] Genesis the world was filled with
[3:03:28] violence.
[3:03:32] The world was filled with
[3:03:35] violence. Many's
[3:03:37] thought were shouting before
[3:03:40] God. Your thoughts shout before God than
[3:03:43] your
[3:03:45] words. It is
[3:03:49] recorded. What is on your tape
[3:03:55] tonight. Praise be to God. way.
[3:04:02] Amen.
[3:04:04] The devil also records
[3:04:06] because many time we even remember
[3:04:08] things we have repented
[3:04:11] of. There is something which God hid
[3:04:14] from the
[3:04:15] devil. What the devil does not know how
[3:04:19] the blood of
[3:04:21] Jesus cleans a sinner.
[3:04:25] Amen. Amen.
[3:04:28] The day you put on that
[3:04:30] mask, you never repented, it's recorded.
[3:04:34] The day you abuse your husband, it's
[3:04:37] recorded. The day you abuse your wife,
[3:04:40] it's on record. The day you you rebel
[3:04:43] against your parents, it's on record.
[3:04:50] the day you
[3:04:57] bewitched. Praise be to
[3:05:01] God. Amen. Amen. Babam talks of the
[3:05:05] white wig on his
[3:05:08] head, the ancient of
[3:05:11] days. Amen. But he says that white
[3:05:14] wig it means wisdom.
[3:05:18] experienced
[3:05:20] judge full of
[3:05:22] wisdom. Amen. He cannot make mistake in
[3:05:26] his
[3:05:28] church. No sir, just like
[3:05:31] Solomon when God gave him wisdom and
[3:05:35] when the other ladies slept on the
[3:05:38] baby and they brought the case before
[3:05:40] the
[3:05:41] king by that wisdom through the wisdom
[3:05:44] which God gave
[3:05:47] him. He passed the right
[3:05:51] judgment. The say was
[3:05:59] saying that everybody will take a piece
[3:06:02] the king in you through the wisdom of
[3:06:05] God. That same judge, the same God who
[3:06:10] gave this time round is the one
[3:06:13] judging. Babam says the judge of
[3:06:17] today put on that white as a stream of
[3:06:21] wisdom.
[3:06:25] Amen.
[3:06:27] But the set of the world
[3:06:30] today sometime they pass a
[3:06:33] judgment and you wonder whether he's a
[3:06:36] judge or he's a
[3:06:40] murderer but not God.
[3:06:45] The eyes saw those things.
[3:06:47] Praise be to God.
[3:06:50] And where we read in revelation here, he
[3:06:52] say the sea gave up that
[3:06:56] day. Just imagine the day of
[3:06:59] judgment. The sea will bring all
[3:07:04] those who drown in
[3:07:07] them. Amen. Let
[3:07:12] victory will bring
[3:07:15] out will bring out. Don't joke with the
[3:07:18] power of
[3:07:21] God. The ones at by
[3:07:27] lions, the ones ate by
[3:07:32] crocodiles, they will come out and stand
[3:07:34] before judgment.
[3:07:37] The world brought its death and even the
[3:07:39] graves brought them and they were
[3:07:42] judged according to their
[3:07:45] work. God is not going to judge
[3:07:47] you according to your mother's word.
[3:07:54] Do whatever you
[3:07:55] do
[3:07:57] knowing if you don't
[3:07:59] repent, judgment is waiting. But it will
[3:08:01] be too late for
[3:08:03] you in the judgment again.
[3:08:08] Praise be to God. It will be too late
[3:08:10] for you to go in the
[3:08:14] judgment. As I'm finishing, I had very
[3:08:17] many quotes, but I'm
[3:08:19] not. I'm finishing with this that on the
[3:08:22] day of judgment records will be brought
[3:08:26] up
[3:08:29] records
[3:08:32] videos audio
[3:08:36] videos. Praise be to God. Who can deny
[3:08:39] that brother is the one speaking in that
[3:08:45] tape? From the day the first message you
[3:08:49] heard, faith is a
[3:08:53] Sabbath. And you heard that voice. When
[3:08:56] I bring the voice of TD J
[3:08:59] today, you will say this not the
[3:09:04] prophet. Praise be to God. When I bring
[3:09:07] the voice of
[3:09:12] pilgrim, but because you heard it that
[3:09:15] day and you cannot miss it, mix it with
[3:09:19] other
[3:09:21] voice on the day of
[3:09:23] judgment. Your tape will be
[3:09:26] played. You will see yourself.
[3:09:31] [Applause]
[3:09:34] Praise be to God.
[3:09:37] You see a brother sneaking in the
[3:09:43] host from men's
[3:09:52] host,
[3:09:57] sisters,
[3:10:00] daughters, men.
[3:10:04] You'll be
[3:10:05] shown when on your
[3:10:08] [Applause]
[3:10:10] smartphone washing dirty filter
[3:10:15] things and you will not
[3:10:18] deny. Blessed be the
[3:10:21] name. Praise be to
[3:10:23] God. There are those who will be on that
[3:10:26] side who
[3:10:30] will just look nothing to say.
[3:10:38] Like they have brought what you did and
[3:10:40] they will ask you do you have anything
[3:10:42] to say? The cameras you are seeing today
[3:10:44] CCTV CCTV. Amen. The scientist broke in
[3:10:52] God's invented
[3:10:58] that you may show your lady mistreating
[3:11:02] your
[3:11:03] children
[3:11:06] skin like your
[3:11:08] mother head which does not like your
[3:11:18] children walk
[3:11:22] anywhere the
[3:11:25] baby gave
[3:11:28] him but when you go to the
[3:11:31] camera what the did
[3:11:34] even the one with the mean will
[3:11:36] Hallelujah praise be to God amen so God
[3:11:40] has his
[3:11:43] But my
[3:11:45] brothers, when you repent of your
[3:11:48] sin, repent of those action.
[3:11:52] Amen. Have you repented?
[3:11:55] Are you in that
[3:11:57] church? Let me tell you when we confess
[3:12:00] our sin, the blood of Jesus goes in
[3:12:04] those
[3:12:05] audios in those
[3:12:07] videos and cleanse it.
[3:12:11] Praise be to God.
[3:12:14] Amen.
[3:12:18] No matter where it hallelujah, we have
[3:12:22] the Holy Ghost. Praise be to God. The
[3:12:26] blood of Jesus goes in the
[3:12:30] devil's and it
[3:12:32] hacks without him
[3:12:35] knowing and
[3:12:39] deletes and go to the recycle bin and
[3:12:42] also
[3:12:44] remove and asked him do you want to
[3:12:52] deleted it cannot be retrieved.
[3:12:56] Praise be to God. I thank God this
[3:13:00] morning because my sins are gone.
[3:13:04] It was
[3:13:05] deleted the way I received
[3:13:08] Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise
[3:13:12] be to
[3:13:14] God. And I will also appear before the
[3:13:17] judgment seat of God.
[3:13:21] Just imagine ever since
[3:13:24] Adam, the devil has been gathering
[3:13:28] evidence to pin
[3:13:30] you on that day. Blessed be the name of
[3:13:34] the Lord. The man is having a mountain
[3:13:36] of
[3:13:38] test, mountain of
[3:13:41] billions. Hallelujah. But on that
[3:13:44] day, Hallelujah. When you're on the
[3:13:48] other side, you have repented and
[3:13:51] received the Holy
[3:13:53] Ghost that will be put
[3:13:57] there. The tape will be brought.
[3:14:01] Jesus has
[3:14:02] it. The devil has it. He's
[3:14:07] your judge. He's our lawyer. He's your
[3:14:12] advocate. He has your
[3:14:14] evidence. The other side
[3:14:18] is everybody will wait.
[3:14:22] They bring the brother Martin and they
[3:14:25] put it there and they will pray it.
[3:14:28] Hallelujah. Glory. Amen. Amen. Yes sir.
[3:14:35] He want to see the other day when
[3:14:38] brother Martin was up when he was doing
[3:14:41] this is very sure it is there.
[3:14:45] But the blood of
[3:14:47] Jesus the devil,
[3:14:50] it went the devil's.
[3:14:53] Hallelujah. Amen. The
[3:15:03] blood and it
[3:15:05] hacked and brought it left it blank.
[3:15:09] Hallelujah.
[3:15:11] Amen. What you need to do?
[3:15:15] Repent. Walk in God's word. Amen.
[3:15:19] Amen. The day is coming.
[3:15:24] Hallelujah. Keep your amen in
[3:15:26] church. Get the Holy Spirit. Remain
[3:15:30] there. Let them laugh at you. Sometimes
[3:15:34] even
[3:15:35] brethren love to
[3:15:37] others. Brothers
[3:15:39] beyond
[3:15:41] cry. Even mucus
[3:15:46] comes God sees all that recording
[3:15:49] recording all that. Amen.
[3:15:51] Amen. The one with
[3:15:53] ties don't even want to
[3:15:56] kneel. My suit is
[3:15:58] expensive and I need I don't want to
[3:16:05] jump when you

[3:16:16] jump on the
[3:16:20] same you are
[3:16:22] there. You are as if you're lost. Your
[3:16:26] day is

[3:16:33] God. There is
[3:16:36] no there's no fun.
[3:16:40] This won't be in
[3:16:42] heaven. It will not be
[3:16:45] there. That fan will not be
[3:16:50] there. Won't be
[3:17:00] there. Don't worry. It is
[3:17:05] recorded. Get your church.
[3:17:09] When somebody seated on, praise be to
[3:17:13] God. When Peter preached the
[3:17:16] word, the
[3:17:18] men, they saw the
[3:17:22] coming and
[3:17:26] wait,
[3:17:27] repent and be baptized in much water.
[3:17:32] You'll get your gift as your holy
[3:17:35] spirit. When they repent, they got the
[3:17:38] Holy Spirit. Amen.
[3:17:40] Amen. Blood of Jesus. It helps in the
[3:17:44] service
[3:17:46] of all their sins. Even
[3:17:51] those in the days of
[3:17:53] Adam, the devil is still
[3:17:59] keeping. The devil is ashamed. He
[3:18:02] doesn't
[3:18:03] even buy.
[3:18:10] And he
[3:18:12] doesn't keep them on the judgment day.
[3:18:15] But on that day, your tape will be
[3:18:18] playing the table will be waiting. He
[3:18:22] will tell his demons, the demons of lies
[3:18:25] of fornication. Now is the time. You did
[3:18:29] a great job. And when it's still there,
[3:18:33] the screen is is
[3:18:36] blank. The screen is the disc is not
[3:18:39] found in the
[3:18:44] device. The disc is not found in the
[3:18:49] device. They remove it
[3:18:55] and then clean it. It is
[3:18:58] impossible. Check the

[3:20:22] be new. Hallelujah.
[3:20:26] Amen. He will take it out of
[3:20:29] papers and open it. Mr.
[3:20:33] Devil, I have a
[3:20:36] evidence to announce what you're
[3:20:40] saying. And here is his
[3:20:43] step of my daughter
[3:20:49] get put it in the
[3:20:52] deck
[3:20:54] then when they put it
[3:20:58] there. I'm a
[3:21:00] soldier of bloodh
[3:21:29] When they
[3:21:32] repent, they prepared for the judgment
[3:21:34] of
[3:21:35] God. The Bible say the
[3:21:39] righteous, they will judge the world.
[3:21:42] Hallelujah. Because they were
[3:21:45] judged. Let the word judge
[3:21:48] you. Allow the word
[3:21:51] to squeeze you
[3:21:53] tonight. But there is life. You will not
[3:21:57] be judged
[3:21:58] again. But take this you don't
[3:22:03] repent. I don't care whatever small you
[3:22:07] see. It will meet you on that day. It
[3:22:10] will be so
[3:22:12] late. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[3:22:15] Hallelujah. Shall we rise on our feet?
[3:22:17] Each one of us will have a
[3:22:19] video.
[3:22:21] Hallelujah. Praise be to God.
[3:22:24] [Music]
[3:22:25] We better put oursel right before it is
[3:22:27] too
[3:22:29] late. The Lord has made us
[3:22:32] provision. Hallelujah where we can run
[3:22:35] and hide
[3:22:37] ourselves. I thank God and I pray always
[3:22:42] that God help me run in this place. Give
[3:22:46] me the grace Lord. Hallelujah.
[3:22:49] Hallelujah.
[3:22:51] [Music]
[3:22:53] Maybe the devil taken you
[3:22:55] [Music]
[3:22:57] deep and you have been wallowing in
[3:23:00] sin having a tag of message
[3:23:04] name. Brother, sister, that will not
[3:23:06] help
[3:23:08] you.
[3:23:09] Hallelujah. The process of the judgment
[3:23:12] has already
[3:23:14] started. We have received the shout of
[3:23:18] voice. Hallelujah.
[3:23:21] And Christ has come down. He's moving in
[3:23:24] his
[3:23:25] judgment. He's moving on earth
[3:23:28] today. He's warning the sons and
[3:23:30] daughters of men about the oncoming
[3:23:33] judgment. The Bible tells us in
[3:23:36] Revelation and even the mountain
[3:23:39] flee in his
[3:23:41] presence. Where will you
[3:23:45] be when that go when that voice calls
[3:23:48] you
[3:23:49] to brother? Where are you going to
[3:23:51] be? Are you certain that your records
[3:23:54] are clean before
[3:23:56] God? Have you confessed your
[3:23:59] sins? Have you
[3:24:01] repented? Have you received the Holy
[3:24:03] Ghost?
[3:24:13] If you feel le to come to the
[3:24:16] altar, just come before the
[3:24:19] Lord and pour your heart before
[3:24:21] him. You don't need to confess before
[3:24:25] me. You don't need to confess before me.
[3:24:28] I'm just the
[3:24:30] force which God has used
[3:24:40] to heaven
[3:24:42] father here we are Lord
[3:24:45] Jesus in our hands no price we
[3:24:49] pray to thy cross we cling
[3:24:52] tonight and we pray that Lord
[3:24:56] God have mercy on us Lord Jesus
[3:25:02] For you have waited us, Father. You wait
[3:25:04] us on a
[3:25:07] scale of wanting Lord
[3:25:15] to you. You know the things we have done
[3:25:17] in our
[3:25:19] lives, the words we have
[3:25:22] spoken which we ought not even to air
[3:25:24] them out of our
[3:25:26] mouth. the things we have done,
[3:25:29] the places we have gone.
[3:25:33] Oh Lord Jesus,
[3:25:36] be merciful unto our
[3:25:38] souls. Have mercy upon us, Lord Jesus.
[3:25:42] Prepare us, Lord Jesus.
[3:25:45] [Music]
[3:25:55] As the pianists are playing, there is a
[3:25:57] fountain filled with the blood.
[3:26:01] There's a fountain filled with the blood
[3:26:04] tonight. It flows from the from
[3:26:08] Emmanuel where sin has
[3:26:12] blinds and lose their greatest
[3:26:17] state. The same warning
[3:26:20] angel said, "I send my messenger before
[3:26:23] you to keep you in the way." That same
[3:26:27] angel is here
[3:26:28] tonight. That same Jesus is here. He's
[3:26:32] still on the mercy seat. He's still
[3:26:35] bleeding for you. His eyes are still
[3:26:38] full of mercy. He's full of
[3:26:41] compassion. But one of these
[3:26:44] days is going to get out of
[3:26:48] You will come as a judge.
[3:26:53] Blessed father, Lord,
[3:26:57] hope each one of us knows,
[3:27:02] you know us in and
[3:27:07] out. Like David say that Lord, you know
[3:27:10] my uprising and downfalling.
[3:27:15] [Music]
[3:27:18] You know our thought tonight Lord.
[3:27:22] But we are glad to know Lord
[3:27:26] Jesus that there is a blood that speaks
[3:27:29] good
[3:27:31] words and the same blood Lord
[3:27:34] Jesus it will speak for us on that day.
[3:27:38] [Music]
[3:27:41] Lord we are here before you.
[3:27:47] We need your grace, Lord
[3:27:50] [Music]
[3:27:51] God. We need your mercy,
[3:27:56] soul. Be merciful unto our poor soul.
[3:28:01] [Music]
[3:28:13] Help us, Lord Jesus
[3:28:16] Christ. Help us, Lord
[3:28:18] [Music]
[3:28:20] God. Give us the Holy Ghost, Lord
[3:28:27] Jesus. We don't want to presume
[3:28:31] by we. We don't want to pretend. My
[3:28:35] God, we know whether we are saved or
[3:28:39] not. We know our actions.
[3:28:42] We know our words whether they are
[3:28:44] focused or
[3:28:46] not. We know the things we do when we
[3:28:49] are
[3:28:49] [Music]
[3:28:51] low. But I sees it
[3:28:57] Lord because there are only two witness
[3:29:00] who stand in the courts of
[3:29:03] God. The eye and the ear.
[3:29:08] Lord and Lord Jesus, you are the true
[3:29:13] witness because you saw all these things
[3:29:16] happen. And Lord, you are the true
[3:29:18] witness.
[3:29:19] Lord because you hear us every voices
[3:29:22] now because even during the times of
[3:29:25] no you say that their minds were
[3:29:28] shouting
[3:29:30] loud before you
[3:29:34] Lord and there's nobody who will
[3:29:38] escape except those Lord have accepted
[3:29:42] you. We are accepting our burdens
[3:29:46] tonight. We ask you to have mercy on
[3:29:50] us. Father, many times we
[3:29:55] presume Christian
[3:29:58] lying, Christian bluffing,
[3:30:03] Lord, speaking
[3:30:05] [Music]
[3:30:07] phil. And we think we'll go with it
[3:30:14] like cracking jokes of the world.
[3:30:19] Nasty jokes Lord
[3:30:21] Jesus watching freely the things oh
[3:30:25] [Music]
[3:30:27] God going to places Lord not to
[3:30:31] go some going in
[3:30:34] bars others in
[3:30:37] beaches others for world
[3:30:40] parties others for swimming
[3:30:49] My Lord is said in your
[3:30:52] word is appointed for man Lord Jesus
[3:30:56] Christ to be alive once
[3:31:00] Lord then after judgment is
[3:31:04] come heaven father this evening we are
[3:31:07] here pleading our case before
[3:31:09] you are asking for your mercy upon our
[3:31:12] families. We asking for your grace upon
[3:31:15] our lives, upon our children, upon our
[3:31:19] fellowship. Lord Jesus,
[3:31:22] [Music]
[3:31:23] help us, Lord.
[3:31:26] Stand between us and our sins.
[3:31:30] Release the blood of Jesus
[3:31:33] tonight to go in every account of every
[3:31:37] believer. Every member of this
[3:31:40] fellowship, every members of our
[3:31:43] family and may your precious
[3:31:45] blood erase it Lord
[3:31:49] [Music]
[3:31:53] Jesus. That is the desire of our
[3:31:56] hearts. Father, we thank you. My
[3:32:07] son when you see the blood will pass
[3:32:10] over us.
[3:32:13] Lord, help me.
[3:32:15] Lord, you know me in and out.
[3:32:23] My brother, my
[3:32:25] sister, remember Daniel Curry
[3:32:29] in his
[3:32:31] vision when he was before that in the
[3:32:33] presence of that
[3:32:35] life and a voice asked
[3:32:38] him he was honest when he
[3:32:40] was but he says in the presence of that
[3:32:44] life he
[3:32:46] realized there were sheds he
[3:32:50] Sh things he
[3:32:54] did. You may tell me
[3:32:57] tonight, brother Martin, what is
[3:33:00] wrong with me going and take some social
[3:33:03] [Music]
[3:33:05] drink with me going and attend those
[3:33:07] prom
[3:33:09] parties. It is
[3:33:11] wrong as a child of
[3:33:14] God to put on those
[3:33:18] slits, short
[3:33:20] dresses, child of God, putting on
[3:33:24] bikinis and moving in
[3:33:26] [Music]
[3:33:28] public, putting on swimming
[3:33:33] costume, going in
[3:33:36] nightclubs. Those are for demons.
[3:33:41] [Music]
[3:33:53] and be sure that your sins will find you
[3:33:55] out if you don't
[3:33:58] [Music]
[3:34:01] repent. Just know everything is on
[3:34:05] record, the day you met that
[3:34:08] boyfriend and you messed up with him and
[3:34:11] you did not repent.
[3:34:14] The day you stole that
[3:34:16] item, you were a recorded brother,
[3:34:20] sister and you did not
[3:34:23] repent. The day you abused your
[3:34:27] mother, the day you cracked jokes about
[3:34:30] your
[3:34:32] [Music]
[3:34:33] mother, you were
[3:34:38] recorded. Although things will find you
[3:34:41] out, the way you conduct yourself at
[3:34:44] your
[3:34:46] workplace, the way your bosses use you
[3:34:48] to cut deals
[3:34:51] there. They use your accounts, that's
[3:34:53] where they send invisent
[3:34:57] funds. They use you to fabricate
[3:35:01] figures. And you think it is
[3:35:04] okay. It is not okay, my brother, my
[3:35:06] sister.
[3:35:10] The day you lie that you've gone to your
[3:35:11] auntie's
[3:35:13] place yet you have gone to stay at your
[3:35:15] boyfriend's
[3:35:17] place. You have gone to meet that
[3:35:20] girlfriend and you are not
[3:35:23] discovered and you think you're going to
[3:35:26] go out with
[3:35:28] us. Brother, sister, repent before it is
[3:35:31] too late.
[3:35:35] The day you went at that wife, that
[3:35:37] woman's
[3:35:40] house and your wife did not
[3:35:43] know. And when you came
[3:35:46] back, you
[3:35:48] lied, you were
[3:35:55] recorded. The day you use that school
[3:35:58] fees,
[3:36:00] your
[3:36:01] teacher and you
[3:36:03] lied that you dropped
[3:36:05] [Music]
[3:36:07] it, you were recorded.
[3:36:11] The day you missed
[3:36:13] church, you were watching
[3:36:17] football and you lie that you at your
[3:36:19] workplace.
[3:36:21] [Applause]
[3:36:26] The day you missed
[3:36:28] overnight and you went to a
[3:36:32] nightclub, brother, sister, you were
[3:36:35] recording
[3:36:37] that I
[3:36:39] saw
[3:36:41] [Applause]
[3:36:49] you. Be
[3:36:51] sure that your record is clear.
[3:36:56] I'm not I don't try to scare
[3:37:00] you but also I have to scare you as
[3:37:03] well because the judgment is coming and
[3:37:07] everything is on
[3:37:08] record and all the parties are
[3:37:11] [Music]
[3:37:26] Ready? Tribulation is
[3:37:28] [Music]
[3:37:30] coming even before the
[3:37:34] judgment where the world that plagues
[3:37:37] will smite the world.
[3:37:40] People will
[3:37:43] rot says the
[3:37:46] prophet and remember the prophet is the
[3:37:48] mouthpiece of
[3:37:50] God. People will rot on their
[3:37:55] flesh. They will look for
[3:37:57] [Music]
[3:38:01] death and death will not be there.
[3:38:07] The Bible say they run from the
[3:38:10] mountain. The mountain will not fall on
[3:38:13] them. Rather, that day is
[3:38:16] coming. That day is so
[3:38:19] close. I was reading the
[3:38:21] message. The sudden and secret coming of
[3:38:24] the Lord
[3:38:25] Jesus where the prophecy
[3:38:30] says, that day is coming.
[3:38:34] It will be
[3:38:35] sudden. It will be
[3:38:37] sacred. And he says that if that day
[3:38:40] will not come in his
[3:38:43] generation, he says the young generation
[3:38:45] will see
[3:38:47] it. And we are that
[3:38:49] generation who have seen our Jews
[3:38:52] back. We seeing the world has come to an
[3:38:57] end. Always in whatever you
[3:39:00] do, wherever you go, know there is a
[3:39:03] judgment coming.
[3:39:06] And the righteous judge is the one who's
[3:39:08] going to
[3:39:14] [Music]
[3:39:16] [Applause]
[3:39:18] judge.
[3:39:22] Jes

[3:41:18] you
[3:41:20] see the precious blood of Jesus is here
[3:41:23] for all the
[3:41:25] believers. If you can believe, you can
[3:41:28] live here when you are saved.
[3:41:34] [Music]
[3:41:37] He releases that blood when you repent.
[3:41:40] [Music]
[3:41:42] When I confess my sins,
[3:41:44] he releases the blood of
[3:41:47] Jesus and cleans

[3:42:29] tonight. He's still redeeming the
[3:42:33] [Music]
[3:42:48] lost. He says you to see no more brother
[3:42:51] sister.
[3:42:52] [Music]
[3:42:54] Just allow the precious blood of Jesus.
[3:43:11] [Music]
[3:43:14] Oh,

[3:43:20] pray I saw that stream
[3:43:23] tonight that flowing wind
[3:43:26] supply coming from his side.
[3:43:35] Jesus was torn apart on the cross of
[3:43:38] Calvary. He was rejected and he saves
[3:43:40] you from the oncoming judgment.
[3:43:48] [Music]
[3:43:56] Heat. Heat.

[3:46:39] Father, it's our cry
[3:46:42] that you hold our hands.
[3:46:45] Help us, Lord,
[3:46:48] to be on your side.
[3:46:51] Give us the Holy
[3:46:53] Spirit to remind us always.
[3:46:56] You have sent preachers through the
[3:46:58] ages to prophets. Lord, the Holy Spirit
[3:47:02] has cried, Lord,
[3:47:05] over and over. The voice of many waters,
[3:47:09] the voice of judgment.
[3:47:13] Father, we thank you that you have
[3:47:16] warned us this day because on the day of
[3:47:19] judgment,
[3:47:21] you'll pull out this
[3:47:22] tape of the
[3:47:24] warning and remind us if we don't
[3:47:28] repent. But God, we have repented.
[3:47:32] Forgive every soul that has repented
[3:47:35] this evening.
[3:47:36] and give them the Holy Ghost. Fill us
[3:47:39] with the Holy Spirit and guide us, Lord.
[3:47:43] Order our footstep, Lord.
[3:47:46] From today hence forth
[3:47:49] in the most name of Jesus Christ to pray
[3:47:52] and believe. Even as we're leaving this
[3:47:55] place, Lord, we pray that you go with
[3:47:57] us, Lord. You guide us. You lead us. You
[3:48:03] hide us Lord under the rock of edges
[3:48:06] until
[3:48:08] Lord that storms passes by that even
[3:48:11] Father when our time comes
[3:48:14] before the
[3:48:15] rapture may we be buried in
[3:48:18] Christ that we will hear that voice on
[3:48:23] that day of final
[3:48:25] call in Christ Jesus.
[3:48:29] Amen.
[3:48:31] Give the Lord a mighty hand clap.
[3:48:36] Hallelujah.
[3:48:38] Amen.
[3:48:40] The Lord bless you.
[3:48:42] I not intended to take you this long.
[3:48:46] I finish my sermon at around 1 around 14
[3:48:50] minutes past

[3:48:58] just have to obey the Holy
[3:49:00] Spirit. May the Lord bless you.
[3:49:04] I not come here to condemn
[3:49:09] you. It is not it's not my
[3:49:12] [Music]
[3:49:14] intention. But also we need to know that
[3:49:16] there is a judgment
[3:49:19] coming. When people are going to the
[3:49:21] courts, the physical
[3:49:23] courts, they
[3:49:26] prepare, praise be to God, but we thank
[3:49:29] God that we are judged when we are in
[3:49:31] the presence of
[3:49:34] God.
[3:49:36] Repent will not be judged on that
[3:49:39] day. That's why we are here. That's why
[3:49:42] God send
[3:49:43] messengers, send the voices of
[3:49:47] rever. And the prophet tells us, he
[3:49:50] preached a sermon called that God has
[3:49:52] not sent a man to a judgment first

[3:50:14] about is the final judgment.
