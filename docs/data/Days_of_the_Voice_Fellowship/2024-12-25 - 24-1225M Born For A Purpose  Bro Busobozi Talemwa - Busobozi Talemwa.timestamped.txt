[1:18:39] Jesus and I'm seeing a man that I don't
[1:18:42] even see in the
[1:18:43] Bible but when I came into the message
[1:18:47] our Prophet told us those are the lies
[1:18:49] of
[1:18:50] denominations we believe in nothing like
[1:18:53] Father Christmas
[1:18:55] and you a Believer should never even
[1:18:57] post those things on your
[1:19:00] walls on your status you find Believers
[1:19:03] posting Father
[1:19:06] Christmas that's that's the
[1:19:09] devil okay pastor what did you just say
[1:19:13] the devil Santa take it the other way
[1:19:17] around Satan
[1:19:20] sat it has nothing to do with Jesus
[1:19:25] nothing to do
[1:19:26] J well if we should celebrate
[1:19:29] Christmas we should have a
[1:19:32] stable we should tell our children the
[1:19:35] story of the birth of
[1:19:39] Jesus you know we should we should be
[1:19:42] happy in our homes and have a good meal
[1:19:45] and teach our children about the birth
[1:19:48] of our Lord Jesus Christ because I mean
[1:19:50] they grow up seeing you celebrating
[1:19:52] their birthdays
[1:19:55] and you're telling them God was born in
[1:19:58] flesh and they have never seen you
[1:20:01] talking about that he was
[1:20:03] born so such a day is good for you to
[1:20:06] now explain the whole thing
[1:20:09] properly and tell them how he was born
[1:20:12] where he was born the scenarios in which
[1:20:15] he was
[1:20:16] born and everything about
[1:20:19] Christmas so today I'm not really going
[1:20:21] to speak on the subject of Christmas
[1:20:25] as in the way I did it I think about two
[1:20:27] years
[1:20:28] ago I preached on a subject called
[1:20:31] Christ in
[1:20:33] Christmas and I was trying to lay the
[1:20:35] foundations what we believe and what we
[1:20:37] don't
[1:20:40] believe so I may not go into that kind
[1:20:43] of thing
[1:20:44] today but maybe for a few remarks before
[1:20:47] we go into the scriptures
[1:20:50] today there are some believers who don't
[1:20:52] even believe in attending church like
[1:20:54] this
[1:20:58] because that the people will say that
[1:21:00] they they also celebrating
[1:21:03] Christmas there is nothing wrong with
[1:21:06] that we are here to celebrate Jesus
[1:21:11] Christ not a
[1:21:13] day we are not sth Day
[1:21:17] Adventist our
[1:21:20] Christmas our Sabbath
[1:21:22] rest is not a day
[1:21:25] it is a
[1:21:26] man Christ Jesus it is the word which
[1:21:31] was bed into our
[1:21:33] hearts 25th
[1:21:35] December is not and cannot be the day
[1:21:37] when Jesus Christ was
[1:21:40] born you know at the time when he was
[1:21:44] born there was you remember there were
[1:21:48] shepherds there were shepherds at that
[1:21:50] time and they were you know in they were
[1:21:54] in you know uh feeding their their
[1:21:58] lambs um and then the Angels Came and
[1:22:03] brought the news of the birth of Jesus
[1:22:06] now you can imagine you know during the
[1:22:08] time of
[1:22:10] snow the Shepherds were never out
[1:22:12] feeding chep or
[1:22:15] LS no they were you know always under
[1:22:18] you know in a place where it is
[1:22:20] warm so this is one of the indications
[1:22:23] to show us that he could not have been
[1:22:24] born on 25th December because that is
[1:22:32] winter so the it was just coined by the
[1:22:36] Roman Catholic
[1:22:39] church but that does not mean that we as
[1:22:44] believers do not believe that Jesus was
[1:22:47] born we don't care when he was born we
[1:22:50] only care about when he was born in our
[1:22:52] life
[1:22:54] in the form of the holy
[1:22:56] spirit so we celebrate every
[1:22:59] day the birth of
[1:23:01] Jesus Amen and not being that today the
[1:23:05] whole world decided to celebrate
[1:23:09] it all right it is okay let us also
[1:23:14] celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ in
[1:23:17] our hearts as we have always
[1:23:21] done and um it's okay to eat good
[1:23:26] meals it is all
[1:23:29] right and to you who is saying pastor no
[1:23:32] that's not
[1:23:34] right tell me where is it in the
[1:23:37] message you know sometimes we take
[1:23:41] Traditions not
[1:23:43] scripture not message but we should take
[1:23:47] the message not
[1:23:49] tradition amen am I talking to someone
[1:23:52] here
[1:23:55] um and and then also
[1:23:58] gifts you know when Jesus was
[1:24:01] born gifts and today I'll talk a little
[1:24:03] bit about gifts gifts were
[1:24:07] given so it's okay to give gifts bam was
[1:24:12] always giving gifts on
[1:24:14] Christmas by people who loved him I'm so
[1:24:18] thankful there are people who love
[1:24:20] me and they brought me some
[1:24:22] gifts I will not mention but they know
[1:24:25] themselves I want to say thank you so
[1:24:27] much those who brought those Christmas
[1:24:30] gifts to me I really very much
[1:24:33] appreciated and those who have not
[1:24:36] brought you can bring as
[1:24:40] well and it's okay to give each other
[1:24:44] gifts each other at Christmas
[1:24:48] gifts show someone
[1:24:50] love don't be very religious
[1:24:54] show someone
[1:24:56] love praise the name of the
[1:24:58] Lord amen so but this morning I want to
[1:25:03] speak on a title that I've titled born
[1:25:05] for a
[1:25:09] purpose born for a
[1:25:14] purpose uh we will go back in our
[1:25:16] scripture in the Book of John
[1:25:23] 18 then pilate ENT entered into the
[1:25:26] Judgment the Judgment Hall again now
[1:25:28] remember this is the time they trying to
[1:25:30] try
[1:25:33] Jesus and pilate you know they brought
[1:25:36] him before
[1:25:37] Pilate and pilate asked
[1:25:40] Jesus are you the king of the
[1:25:43] Jews so Jesus answered
[1:25:46] him do you say this of
[1:25:50] yourself or did others tell you about
[1:25:54] like
[1:25:55] this so pilate
[1:25:57] answered am I a Jew your own nation and
[1:26:01] the chief priest have delivered you to
[1:26:04] me tell me what have you
[1:26:07] done Jesus answered my kingdom is not of
[1:26:11] this
[1:26:12] world praise the name of the Lord if my
[1:26:15] kingdom were of this
[1:26:17] world then would my servants
[1:26:20] fight that I should not be delivered to
[1:26:22] the Jews
[1:26:24] but now is my kingdom not from
[1:26:27] heav how many know the song to be like
[1:26:31] Jesus to be like Jesus I believe our
[1:26:36] kingdom is not of this
[1:26:37] world so we like Jesus our kingdom is
[1:26:42] not of this
[1:26:45] world Jesus answered my kingdom is not
[1:26:47] of this
[1:26:49] world so pil there said unto
[1:26:52] him are you a king
[1:26:55] then this is the second time he's
[1:26:58] asking Jesus answered thou sayest I am a
[1:27:03] king so in other words Jesus did not say
[1:27:05] I am not a
[1:27:07] king but he said you have said I am
[1:27:11] a so to this end was I
[1:27:15] born and for this cause I came into the
[1:27:18] world that I should bear witness unto
[1:27:21] the
[1:27:22] truth praise the name of the Lord there
[1:27:25] are two things there that you need to
[1:27:27] look at number one he says I was
[1:27:30] born for this cause number two he says
[1:27:34] for this cause I came into the
[1:27:37] world did you just get the understanding
[1:27:40] of
[1:27:41] that he talking about two things he was
[1:27:44] born and then he came into the world
[1:27:47] those are two different
[1:27:49] things Jesus coming into the world means
[1:27:52] he came from somewhere
[1:27:55] meaning he he was before he
[1:27:58] came he is more than what we
[1:28:01] see he is more than what the religions
[1:28:03] and the denominations are celebrating
[1:28:06] [Music]
[1:28:08] today he is more than a baby in a
[1:28:12] Manger he is God in
[1:28:15] flesh he created the heavens and the
[1:28:19] Earth but here he has come down into the
[1:28:22] Earth
[1:28:25] I want you to see in the message God's
[1:28:28] Gift always find their
[1:28:31] places he says when you
[1:28:34] realize what are we doing
[1:28:39] here where did we come
[1:28:42] from these are very important
[1:28:46] questions or what business we we get we
[1:28:50] get we got being here
[1:28:55] we wasn't put here just by
[1:28:58] chance we were put here for a
[1:29:02] purpose and we must serve that
[1:29:05] purpose but still we are back on the
[1:29:08] basis of free moral
[1:29:12] ageny where we can serve
[1:29:15] it or reject it just like Adam did in
[1:29:20] the
[1:29:21] beginning I I want each of you to ask
[1:29:24] yourselves this
[1:29:27] question
[1:29:29] what what are we doing
[1:29:32] here where did we come from where did
[1:29:36] you come from did you come from some of
[1:29:39] you would say I came from my
[1:29:41] father I came from my
[1:29:43] grandfather where did we come from where
[1:29:46] did I come from where did you come from
[1:29:50] it's a question that you must ask
[1:29:52] yourself there are some people who don't
[1:29:53] believe believe in
[1:29:55] God they believe they just
[1:29:57] happened and they believe they're just
[1:29:59] going to
[1:30:01] disappear Into Thin Air so because of
[1:30:04] that they don't care how they live they
[1:30:07] don't care how they take their vessel
[1:30:09] their
[1:30:10] body they they go into
[1:30:12] immorality they smoke they drink they
[1:30:16] don't really care they will even tell
[1:30:18] you don't take life
[1:30:21] seriously you living so seriously
[1:30:25] and you know when they find Believers
[1:30:26] the way we
[1:30:28] live I don't dress that way I don't
[1:30:31] dress that I don't eat that I don't talk
[1:30:35] speak that way they will be surprised
[1:30:39] they will be shocked when they see how
[1:30:41] our sisters
[1:30:42] dress when they see how we behave around
[1:30:45] our
[1:30:46] sisters when they see how we talk when
[1:30:49] they see how we don't
[1:30:51] talk they are shocked
[1:30:54] because they can't understand how we
[1:30:57] reason because for them they think
[1:31:00] they're just like a
[1:31:01] tree that just grew and dies and goes
[1:31:05] into
[1:31:06] nothing they think they're just like a
[1:31:09] god which is just you know raised and
[1:31:11] maybe is eaten and it
[1:31:14] disappears they think they're just like
[1:31:16] uh you know any other
[1:31:18] creature but I will have you to know
[1:31:20] this morning we are more than any other
[1:31:23] creature
[1:31:25] we are the super
[1:31:27] R when God created all the other
[1:31:31] creatures at the end of it he said
[1:31:34] now let us create
[1:31:37] man in our own
[1:31:39] image so you see God was
[1:31:42] lonely God needed someone like
[1:31:46] him all the other creatures he
[1:31:49] created but he needed another creature
[1:31:54] my which was more than a
[1:31:56] creature he needed someone like
[1:31:59] him someone he could fellowship with
[1:32:03] someone he could understand and someone
[1:32:06] who could understand
[1:32:07] him and the only thing that would would
[1:32:10] be like
[1:32:11] that is something like
[1:32:14] God something that is equal to
[1:32:17] God praise the name of the Lord and so
[1:32:20] he said I will create man in my image
[1:32:24] so man is a
[1:32:27] super he was created to do what to have
[1:32:31] dominion to over the fish of the sea
[1:32:35] over the fowls of the air over the
[1:32:37] beasts of the
[1:32:38] field we are above any
[1:32:41] animal we are above any bir we are above
[1:32:45] any fish we are created for a
[1:32:49] purpose Adam came into this world oh my
[1:32:52] God now listen Adam was not just
[1:32:55] born Adam came into the world I was not
[1:33:00] just
[1:33:00] born I came into this world she
[1:33:04] hallelujah hallelujah she's not my
[1:33:07] mother because I came into the
[1:33:09] world did you ever see no no no did you
[1:33:12] ever see Jesus saying Mary was was his
[1:33:17] mother did you ever see that not one
[1:33:21] time in this whole Bible did Mary call
[1:33:24] Jesus
[1:33:26] mother Jesus call Mary
[1:33:29] mother never happened why why because
[1:33:33] Jesus
[1:33:35] understood that where he came he he knew
[1:33:38] who he
[1:33:39] was he knew what he was doing here he
[1:33:43] knew where he came from and he knew what
[1:33:46] business got him into
[1:33:48] [Music]
[1:33:50] the but the problem why we can't
[1:33:52] overcome
[1:33:55] oh hallelujah hallelujah why we can't
[1:33:57] overcome the
[1:33:59] world is because we always think we are
[1:34:01] born by our
[1:34:04] mothers but the Bible says man born of a
[1:34:08] woman is of a few days and full of
[1:34:13] trouble few days and full of
[1:34:16] trouble man born of a woman how many
[1:34:19] year born of a
[1:34:20] woman how many year born of a woman
[1:34:24] where you can refuse but that's the
[1:34:26] truth you are born by a
[1:34:28] woman I was born by a woman too you to
[1:34:32] was born by a woman no matter how strong
[1:34:34] or how big or how intelligent you are
[1:34:37] you are born by a woman because of that
[1:34:41] you are full of trouble and you are over
[1:34:43] a few
[1:34:44] days you grow old and you die you get
[1:34:50] sick you know teeth will begin to come
[1:34:55] out some of you are losing a lot of
[1:34:59] Truth and others are having pain right
[1:35:01] now for
[1:35:02] something why because you are
[1:35:06] disintegrated you are born of a woman
[1:35:08] you are full of
[1:35:09] trouble you are like a a flower or like
[1:35:12] a um like a tree or something or a
[1:35:15] flower the B calls it a flower it just
[1:35:19] dries up you know that's how we are all
[1:35:22] of us but I want you to know there is
[1:35:26] some other
[1:35:28] man in me that is not born of a
[1:35:33] woman now when a child of God
[1:35:37] understands
[1:35:38] that then a child of God will begin
[1:35:43] overcoming when a child of God
[1:35:46] understand I didn't I was not born of a
[1:35:50] woman I came into this world
[1:35:54] and I came into this world for a
[1:35:56] purpose you know when job was suffering
[1:36:00] and he had a very terrible time in his
[1:36:03] life you know God came down and ask him
[1:36:05] a
[1:36:06] question where are
[1:36:08] you where were you when I created the
[1:36:12] heavens and earth where were you when
[1:36:15] the sons of God sh for Joy where were
[1:36:17] you answer the question where were you
[1:36:21] and the answer is simple I was in
[1:36:26] God before the foundation of the
[1:36:29] world I am not just you know appearing
[1:36:33] here for the first time I have I have
[1:36:38] existed
[1:36:39] before not not as in
[1:36:44] preexistence but I have been in his
[1:36:48] mind I have come
[1:36:50] here for a certain business
[1:36:57] so what are we doing here where did we
[1:37:00] come from what business did we come here
[1:37:04] to
[1:37:05] do and says we was not put here by
[1:37:11] chance we were put here for a
[1:37:15] purpose Amen Let Me Tell You Brethren
[1:37:19] the day I started
[1:37:21] overcoming is when I found out my life's
[1:37:26] purpose the reason why many people are
[1:37:30] destroyed why many people
[1:37:32] suffer why they fail to live a Christian
[1:37:35] Life it's because they have never found
[1:37:37] out the purpose why they
[1:37:40] born I was not born to eat and
[1:37:44] die I was not born to
[1:37:47] dress I was not born to have children I
[1:37:50] was not born for all those
[1:37:52] things was born for more than
[1:37:55] those I was not born just to
[1:37:58] marry it is a spiritual purpose I am
[1:38:03] here I was born for a
[1:38:06] purpose Jesus was born for a
[1:38:09] purpose there are many things he
[1:38:12] did but there was this one
[1:38:16] purpose why he was
[1:38:19] born let me tell you when you find out
[1:38:22] the purpose why you were
[1:38:24] born you begin
[1:38:28] overcoming you begin
[1:38:30] overcoming you begin over coming and
[1:38:33] there there comes a
[1:38:35] time when you
[1:38:37] die now when you
[1:38:40] die your work is
[1:38:42] done then you have to
[1:38:45] report on how you
[1:38:48] live that is a a real truth
[1:38:53] all of us each of
[1:38:55] us will give an
[1:38:57] account on how you lived your
[1:39:02] life did you leave for the
[1:39:13] purpose have to do anything on
[1:39:16] it yes because the prophet here says You
[1:39:20] must serve that purpose
[1:39:23] but then he says but still we are on the
[1:39:26] basis of free moral
[1:39:29] agen where we can serve
[1:39:32] it or reject
[1:39:35] it praise the Lord Paul one time he
[1:39:39] found out at first he thought he was
[1:39:41] born to persecute the the
[1:39:45] Christians but one day he met the pill
[1:39:48] of
[1:39:50] fire and when he met that pill of Fire
[1:39:53] from that day he realized he was born
[1:39:56] for a greater
[1:39:59] purpose and everything
[1:40:03] changed all his affiliations changed all
[1:40:06] his friends changed all his
[1:40:10] associations and then he started leing
[1:40:11] for that
[1:40:13] purpose one time he said to me if I
[1:40:18] preach not the
[1:40:19] gospel why he had found his life's
[1:40:22] purpose
[1:40:26] he had found his life's
[1:40:28] purpose and he knew if he doesn't do
[1:40:32] it
[1:40:34] him there are people who are
[1:40:37] born just to be um to help people in the
[1:40:44] world you find that someone is
[1:40:47] born just to be a philanthropist
[1:40:53] the Bible calls it the gift of
[1:40:56] helps and that that is just that person
[1:40:59] need
[1:41:01] purpose they don't know how to preach
[1:41:04] they don't know how to sing they don't
[1:41:06] know how to you know you know do
[1:41:08] anything
[1:41:09] else for them wherever they look
[1:41:13] wherever they are found they have that
[1:41:16] thing of wanting to make someone's life
[1:41:20] better do you know people will receive
[1:41:24] eternal
[1:41:26] life just that
[1:41:29] basis and they don't even know they are
[1:41:32] not doing those things so they can get
[1:41:34] eternal
[1:41:36] life but they will just get it and then
[1:41:39] they will wonder when were you in the
[1:41:41] hospital and we visited you when were
[1:41:45] you sick and we visited you when were
[1:41:48] you hungry and we fed you when were you
[1:41:51] naked and and and we dress
[1:41:54] and he said when you did it to the
[1:41:56] little
[1:41:57] ones you did it unto me so they were

[1:43:32] purpose God put them into this
[1:43:35] world to do
[1:43:37] that and the problem of
[1:43:40] mankind is finding

[1:43:48] it that is the problem of
[1:43:51] mankind when they find their they they
[1:43:53] can't they don't want to stay in their
[1:43:58] life if if people found their life's
[1:44:03] purpose you would not have um um

[1:45:11] life's purpose is to get

[1:45:18] very narrow
[1:45:19] [Music]
[1:45:21] way you were pleased in this
[1:45:24] world to touch people's
[1:45:28] lives to change the
[1:45:30] world I am here to change the
[1:45:34] world I don't care how many are there
[1:45:38] changing the world they cannot change it
[1:45:40] like I
[1:45:41] do you understand there's only one me in
[1:45:45] the
[1:45:46] world there are many people called
[1:45:50] Jesus even in the days of Jesus there
[1:45:53] was a man called
[1:45:55] Jesus read your Bible but he could not
[1:45:58] be Jesus of
[1:46:01] Nazareth Hallelujah there is only one
[1:46:04] Jesus who was
[1:46:06] born for a
[1:46:08] purpose dying and redeeming
[1:46:12] mankind he was only him that's why we
[1:46:16] are the only
[1:46:19] Jesus only Jesus could die on the
[1:46:24] and save the world there are others who
[1:46:26] died on the
[1:46:28] cross but only Jesus die on the cross
[1:46:32] change the
[1:46:33] world only Jesus was born a
[1:46:38] virgin only Jesus was born for that
[1:46:42] purpose I don't care how many do what
[1:46:45] I'm
[1:46:46] doing don't care how many do what you're
[1:46:49] doing don't be anxious for anything
[1:46:53] God has brought you into this world to
[1:46:56] live a life of purpose to change the
[1:46:59] world around
[1:47:00] you to bring a Revival into the
[1:47:03] world Amen and to bring the name of the
[1:47:05] Lord to be
[1:47:08] glorified praise the name of the Lord if
[1:47:11] it is dying on the
[1:47:13] cross there are many who have died
[1:47:16] before even Jesus was
[1:47:18] born you know even the time when he was
[1:47:21] dying
[1:47:22] are those who died with him on the cross
[1:47:26] at the same
[1:47:28] place so when you're talking about
[1:47:31] go
[1:47:35] calary there was great
[1:47:38] and at
[1:47:40] Cal on that same day at Calvary there
[1:47:43] was the blood of Jesus and the blood of
[1:47:46] these other
[1:47:49] thieves so which blood are you talking
[1:47:51] about
[1:47:53] the the thing is not about
[1:47:55] Calvary when we talk about Calvary we
[1:47:58] are talking about the man
[1:48:01] Jesus amen and that's why it's not the
[1:48:05] Lal physical
[1:48:08] blood might even have powered down and
[1:48:10] mixed
[1:48:12] up we are talking about the blood that
[1:48:14] you receive by
[1:48:18] Faith by faith in him by faith in his
[1:48:22] word
[1:48:23] that's why Jesus here
[1:48:25] said this is the reason why I came into
[1:48:29] this world I was born into this world I
[1:48:33] came that I should bear
[1:48:35] witness unto the truth he was a faithful
[1:48:40] witness and he says everyone that
[1:48:43] believes or lies the
[1:48:45] truth will hear my
[1:48:48] voice and we hear his voice and we
[1:48:51] believe his voice
[1:48:53] why because we also are born for our
[1:48:58] purpose he came into the world you know
[1:49:02] in the Book of John he says that he came
[1:49:03] into the
[1:49:04] world and his own received
[1:49:08] him praise the name of the Lord so
[1:49:11] before you leave church this
[1:49:13] morning I want you to just have that
[1:49:17] answer why were you
[1:49:20] born what are you doing here
[1:49:24] where did you come from what business
[1:49:26] did you come here to
[1:49:28] do Believers are
[1:49:33] alens we came from another
[1:49:36] place and we came here for a
[1:49:39] mission some of you don't know your
[1:49:43] mission what is your
[1:49:48] mission you find
[1:49:50] someone he wants to sing he wants to
[1:49:53] preach he wants to play he wants
[1:49:57] to Brethren if we can understand each of
[1:50:02] us we are born for a
[1:50:05] purpose and if each of us find our
[1:50:08] purpose and we zero on
[1:50:12] it zero on it the world can
[1:50:17] change the world can
[1:50:19] change you know I've been seeing some of
[1:50:22] our brother Brothers in um in the in the
[1:50:25] Western
[1:50:27] World you find a brother or a
[1:50:30] sister finding out when they
[1:50:33] young in their
[1:50:36] teens finding out that they were born to
[1:50:39] be a
[1:50:43] Pianist that person will begin playing
[1:50:46] the
[1:50:47] piano that person will be faithful to
[1:50:50] that c
[1:50:53] from that infant
[1:50:55] age growing up getting married they will
[1:51:00] still remain
[1:51:01] faithful you know growing up they have
[1:51:04] children they will still remain
[1:51:06] faithful they will have grandchild they
[1:51:09] will remain
[1:51:11] faithful at the post of
[1:51:13] Duty never leaving unless they really
[1:51:16] dying in the hospital they always be at
[1:51:19] the piano growing old B
[1:51:24] the duty and they only are stopped
[1:51:28] because of
[1:51:33] death why they find found out their
[1:51:36] life's
[1:51:38] purpose they found out their life's
[1:51:40] purpose our purpose is just not to make
[1:51:44] money go to school make money children
[1:51:47] do this we are doing all these things
[1:51:50] because we are born of a woman
[1:51:52] one thing we
[1:51:54] do because we are born of
[1:51:57] God hallelujah hallelujah we do all
[1:52:00] these things because we are born of a
[1:52:03] woman and they all full of
[1:52:05] trouble but we do one thing when we
[1:52:09] realize we are born of God and that one
[1:52:13] thing is the purpose for which we came
[1:52:16] into
[1:52:19] this and if you've not found out yet
[1:52:23] you will never overcome the world
[1:52:26] because the Bible says that they that
[1:52:27] are born of
[1:52:29] God overcome the
[1:52:31] world not they that are born of a woman
[1:52:35] but they that are born of
[1:52:37] God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah not all
[1:52:41] of us are born to be
[1:52:44] millionaires I believe we are all born
[1:52:46] not to be poor
[1:52:49] right but not all of us will be
[1:52:51] millionaires
[1:52:54] yes not all of us will be
[1:52:57] millionaires but there are those who are
[1:52:58] born to be
[1:53:01] millionair that God knew before the
[1:53:04] foundation of
[1:53:05] the heed in this one to make a lot of
[1:53:09] Millions for what
[1:53:11] purpose so you can live a life of
[1:53:15] [Music]
[1:53:18] service there are some of you that even
[1:53:20] if you got $10,000
[1:53:25] we will not see you at church
[1:53:29] again that's how we know
[1:53:32] you you're not called for
[1:53:34] that some of you can't handle you know
[1:53:37] some small
[1:53:39] money but these people who are born to
[1:53:41] be that
[1:53:42] one it's not money they
[1:53:45] value it is the purpose for which they
[1:53:50] born they are given to the distribution
[1:53:52] of the
[1:53:55] Saints I hope that this little thought
[1:53:58] can you know come into your heart and
[1:54:00] burden you to find out why are you
[1:54:06] born why do we have people fighting
[1:54:10] people families fighting siblings
[1:54:14] fighting
[1:54:16] jealous why do we have
[1:54:18] witchcraft is because people don't know
[1:54:20] why they are born
[1:54:23] someone sees another one driving and
[1:54:24] they feel so bad in
[1:54:26] [Music]
[1:54:27] their it should be me I'll be them and
[1:54:32] you find someone who was
[1:54:35] prospering everything goes down and then
[1:54:37] they begin
[1:54:39] suffering smiling I'm so thankful that
[1:54:42] Believers we cannot be
[1:54:46] Bewitched we cannot be Beed but if you
[1:54:49] go and live the wrong kind of life
[1:54:53] this statement doesn't apply to
[1:54:56] you if you go live the wrong kind of
[1:54:59] life you go in the devil's
[1:55:02] territory witcraft will catch
[1:55:04] you as sure as there is a God in
[1:55:08] heaven until you
[1:55:10] repent but a Believer who knows their
[1:55:14] position in
[1:55:15] Christ who is living right witchcraft
[1:55:19] has no power over them
[1:55:23] hallelujah hallelujah amen praise the
[1:55:26] name of the Lord and so you find you
[1:55:29] know all those things happening in the
[1:55:30] people's
[1:55:32] hearts that's why by the way when you
[1:55:35] receive the Holy
[1:55:36] Ghost you receive the
[1:55:39] knowledge you receive the
[1:55:42] understanding why you came into the
[1:55:44] world and so you will love

[1:56:03] when you receive the Holy Spirit you

[1:56:19] of your heart you should love
[1:56:22] every you should have no

[2:08:31] put Mighty purpose hallelujah amen born
[2:08:36] for a
[2:08:37] purpose and Jesus was born for a
[2:08:40] purpose he found out his
[2:08:43] purpose when he was so
[2:08:45] young you know before he was even
[2:08:48] born his purpose was declared
[2:08:52] first by
[2:08:54] prophets Isaiah
[2:08:56] 96 just to give you a few
[2:08:58] examples to us a child is born and to us
[2:09:02] a son is given and a government shall be
[2:09:04] upon his should and his name Shall be
[2:09:06] Called
[2:09:08] wonderful the Mighty God the Everlasting
[2:09:12] father the prince of peace now many
[2:09:16] debated on this
[2:09:18] scripture even when Jesus was being born
[2:09:22] they still debated on
[2:09:23] it it was a hard scripture during the
[2:09:27] time but everyone had their own
[2:09:30] opinion but God does not give an
[2:09:34] opinion his word is that say the
[2:09:37] Lord it must
[2:09:41] happen whatever his word has prophesied
[2:09:44] about
[2:09:45] me it must
[2:09:47] happen if he says I'm a man of Val
[2:09:51] I used to read those
[2:09:53] scriptures and I look at myself having
[2:09:56] no much education having no money no big
[2:10:01] backround and I was wondering how are
[2:10:03] these
[2:10:04] things listen let me tell you brother
[2:10:07] When God says something about you in his
[2:10:10] word better believe
[2:10:13] it because his word cannot
[2:10:17] fail his word has never failed
[2:10:21] shall always be
[2:10:23] accomplished how does God fulfill how
[2:10:26] does God you know explain his
[2:10:28] word by making it come to
[2:10:32] pass I am fearfully and wonderfully
[2:10:36] man it must happen if you doubt it just
[2:10:41] watch the
[2:10:43] space God will show by making it come to
[2:10:47] pass how fearfully and wonderfully
[2:10:51] made I
[2:10:53] am are you hearing
[2:10:55] me I'll be head and not a
[2:10:58] tail you believe that your heads are not
[2:11:03] t by that's a prophecy for you
[2:11:06] also from the word pastor preached for
[2:11:10] us here scriptural
[2:11:13] Authority that is scriptural Authority
[2:11:15] for
[2:11:16] us so by scriptural
[2:11:19] Authority I tell you today
[2:11:21] you shall be heads
[2:11:24] and now if you believe it it shall be if
[2:11:28] someone doubts it tell them wash the
[2:11:33] space something is working something
[2:11:37] Isen soon and very soon God is going to
[2:11:41] lift me from glory to glory
[2:11:47] to whatever you desire according his
[2:11:51] word it must be and he will fulfill
[2:11:56] it that's how
[2:11:58] godes by fulfilling his
[2:12:01] word so the child was born
[2:12:04] anyhow but they were
[2:12:06] debating but the child was already born
[2:12:09] even when he came in the temple and they
[2:12:11] called him
[2:12:12] demon he was born he was a child nothing
[2:12:16] could stop

[2:44:50] the Jews didn't understand but the Bible

[2:44:55] Temple of his
[2:44:59] body the body that was
[2:45:02] born in a
[2:45:04] manger
[2:45:06] was a
[2:45:08] temple of
[2:45:12] God when we say son of
[2:45:15] God we mean temple of God
[2:45:20] God
[2:45:21] himself came in a body of
[2:45:23] man Jesus was the body of
[2:45:27] God that's why we say Jesus is

[2:52:20] he's crushed out Young
[2:52:22] Life at Calvary where the sins of the
[2:52:25] world
[2:52:28] ground and because of his sacrifice for
[2:52:34] Sinners that he
[2:52:37] died there he was

[2:54:00] Jesus it hits you
[2:54:02] hard to know what he
[2:54:05] became for what we should
[2:54:10] become and I want
[2:54:12] to if you can turn with me to the Book
[2:54:14] of Mark 15
[2:54:18] and the chief Priestess of all the
[2:54:20] council sought for witness against
[2:54:24] Jesus to put him to death and for
[2:54:29] none for many bear false witness against
[2:54:32] him but their witness agreed not
[2:54:36] together and there arose sat and bear
[2:54:38] false witness against
[2:54:41] him we heard
[2:54:44] him you all heard what Jesus said
[2:54:48] but I want you to see what this man
[2:54:51] says we heard
[2:54:53] him say I will destroy this
[2:54:57] Temple that is made with hands and
[2:55:00] within three days I will build another
[2:55:02] one made without hands is that what
[2:55:05] Jesus
[2:55:07] said this man changed the
[2:55:09] words because he he lacked
[2:55:15] understanding but neither so did there
[2:55:18] Witnesses agree
[2:55:22] together and the high priest stood in
[2:55:24] the
[2:55:25] mid and he asked Jesus
[2:55:28] saying you answer nothing what is it
[2:55:31] with these Witnesses against
[2:55:34] you but he held his
[2:55:38] p and answered
[2:55:40] nothing
[2:55:43] Frankin again the high priest asked
[2:55:47] him said to him thou the Christ the son
[2:55:51] of the
[2:55:52] blessed and Jesus
[2:55:56] said I
[2:55:58] [Music]

[2:56:03] man sitting on the right hand of
[2:56:06] God and coming in the Clouds of
[2:56:09] heaven then the high priest rent his
[2:56:13] clothes and said what need we any F

[2:56:19] you have had the
[2:56:20] blasphemy what think and they all
