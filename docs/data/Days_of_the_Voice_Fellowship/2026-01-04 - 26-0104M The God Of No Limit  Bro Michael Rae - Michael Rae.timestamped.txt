[36:47] Uh there's a testimony that came last
[36:49] year and we forgot to give to give it
[36:52] here. But we thank God.
[36:56] There's a time when we were there at the
[36:59] clinic
[37:00] and all of a sudden a brother came and
[37:04] gave us things that we did not expect.
[37:07] He brought for us a microscope. He
[37:09] brought medicine. brought a dental chair
[37:13] all free of charge. We thank God for
[37:15] that.
[37:19] And then at the beginning of this year,
[37:22] God has done us well again.
[37:25] Uh it was on first when my husband was
[37:28] at the pharmacy
[37:30] and met a colleague. They are not
[37:32] friends for long. But I think sometimes
[37:35] God makes you meet some people for a
[37:38] purpose.
[37:40] This person as they were interacting
[37:44] told him there is a deal of an
[37:47] ultrasound scan and the the owner of the
[37:51] ultrasound scan got a challenge and was
[37:53] selling it by faith. We just went and
[37:57] saw it. We didn't have any money because
[38:00] it needs some millions of money. We
[38:03] didn't even have 200 on us. But we went
[38:07] by faith and saw it.
[38:10] But by yesterday in the afternoon, God
[38:13] made a way and we have it in our
[38:15] custody.
[38:17] We bless the name of the Lord.
[38:22] Thank you so much, sister. We really
[38:24] thank God. Amen. Sister Phill
[38:33] knows all about us. Praise God.
[38:38] God bless you church.

[39:18] Stand amazed in your presence.
[39:26] There is nothing you cannot do.
[39:35] There is no one like you,
[39:39] Jesus.
[39:43] There is no one like you
[39:48] in all the earth.
[39:51] There is no one like you,
[39:56] Jesus.

[50:44] I give you my soul.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; I'll live for you alone.
[50:56] Every breath that I take,
[51:01] every moment I'm awake,
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, have your way in me.
[51:14] Lord, I give you my heart.
[51:19] I give you my soul.
[51:23] I live for you.
[51:27] For you alone,
[51:31] every breath that I take, every moment,
[51:36] &gt;&gt; every moment I'm awake,
[51:41] &gt;&gt; have your way.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, have your way in me.
[52:04] Amen. God bless you.
[52:07] Uh we had prepared to show you the
[52:09] illustrations here.
[52:15] Yeah. But uh logistically we have been
[52:18] unable. But if you want uh we are going
[52:21] to uh show you this after
[52:26] we have a meeting after the service for
[52:31] the youth camp.
[52:34] So if you want to get these details
[52:36] kindly
[52:38] remain behind so that we shall show you
[52:42] all the details.
[52:44] So I'll be brief.
[52:47] We started getting the contributions for
[52:49] the youth camp.
[52:53] Mostly it was from the youth
[52:56] and we get we got overwhelming pledges.
[53:02] So by the grace of God
[53:05] we raised we raised a good amount of
[53:08] money.
[53:10] So let us clap for ourselves and also
[53:12] clap for
[53:17] Amen.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; So an overview is here. Uh we had here
[53:23] we collected a total uh like 64 pledges
[53:27] as in from 64 people pledged
[53:33] that is for the youth camp for different
[53:36] amounts.
[53:38] And of the six tip four people
[53:42] 53 have cleared something towards the
[53:45] wall.
[53:49] Yeah. Meaning only 11 have not given
[53:52] anything.
[53:56] This means those who have paid it's from
[53:59] as low as 2,000 to 1 million.
[54:06] Amen. Amen.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; So the amount we raised was we pledged
[54:11] was 14 million
[54:15] and 716,000
[54:21] and of that amount
[54:25] uh we have been able to raise um to
[54:30] collect
[54:33] a total of um
[54:36] a total of 8 million
[54:41] 583,000.
[54:48] We are having only four days remaining
[54:51] to the youth camp
[54:55] and currently
[54:58] uh we are having uh a budget
[55:27] come rain comes sunshine
[55:30] we won't get any other money from any
[55:33] like the church and everything
[55:38] all right so this means we are having a
[55:40] balance
[55:43] a B of 20.
[55:52] Of course, this some of this amount will
[55:55] be got from the people who be camping
[56:00] from the camp fees
[56:04] but it can't be all of these amounts.
[56:10] So this literally means
[56:15] us who pledged and have not completed
[56:17] our pledges,
[56:20] we need to uh finalize this before
[56:23] Wednesday
[56:27] and those that have not contributed
[56:32] kindly reach out to us after the
[56:34] service.
[56:37] We appreciate those who have given uh
[56:40] today morning we have received a good
[56:43] amount of pledges
[56:47] in cash.
[56:50] God bless you.
[56:53] So lastly,
[56:55] the amount I've been mentioning
[56:59] came from the youth.
[57:02] So let's really clap for ourselves. You
[57:04] have never done this before.
[57:09] So for the uh the higher uh I think I
[57:13] can talk of
[57:15] uh the 40th floor the fourth floor up up
[57:24] we have received only from four people.
[57:32] So and the total pledge is 456.
[57:39] and their own reform.
[57:43] So for the rest,
[57:45] reach out to us
[57:49] and let us petition the 24 million.
[57:54] If we get the 14,
[57:57] maybe that 10 might come from the camp.
[58:03] Yeah. So God bless you.
[58:05] And if you are really touched and you
[58:08] want to have this uh done in the best
[58:11] way
[58:14] taking good care of the ministers
[58:17] having we already secured our place
[58:21] so kindly get remain back so that we can
[58:25] plan
[58:29] then as as I also finish
[58:32] if you want the accommodation for the
[58:34] youth camp.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; We have negotiated and you can get a
[58:42] very very executive accommodation
[58:47] at around
[58:49] 120.
[58:52] But if you have 100, you can also see
[58:54] us.
[58:58] If you can't afford that, you can get
[59:00] someone.
[59:04] someone then
[59:06] you be two
[59:10] then you split it into two.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. So though I'll be glad to see the
[59:19] for each day.
[59:23] Yes. But it's like
[59:26] it's like a hotel.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; All right. God bless you. Amen.

[1:24:50] We also had other brothers. So, brother
[1:24:52] Michael is really burdened and with a
[1:24:55] passion to take this message out
[1:24:59] and I think that's something that I and
[1:25:00] him share.
[1:25:04] So, it has united us
[1:25:06] in heart and so uh for you who don't
[1:25:10] know him, he was our first youth camp
[1:25:13] speaker
[1:25:16] and at that time we were here.
[1:25:19] But you see, he also visited us when we
[1:25:21] were still in the little shop over
[1:25:22] there.
[1:25:25] We call it a little shop. And so I'm
[1:25:27] sure he he can see the growth and all
[1:25:29] that. We've been with him all the way.
[1:25:33] His grandfather mentored me in this
[1:25:35] message ministry.
[1:25:39] For those of you who don't know, he's a
[1:25:43] I'm sure he doesn't want me to say, but
[1:25:44] he's a grandson of Eddie Biscaris.
[1:25:48] I think I'm personally very honored to
[1:25:50] have him
[1:25:53] and you know for him to accept to come
[1:25:55] and preach for us this Sunday morning.
[1:25:59] Are you all happy that we have brother?
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, brother Michael Ray from
[1:26:11] Canada.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Canada.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Just let us sing that uh one more time.
[1:26:14] as he does.
[1:26:17] Here I am to worship.
[1:26:20] And then as uh I think he will just
[1:26:22] invite the uh uh the babies the baby to
[1:26:26] be dedicated.
[1:26:36] to bow.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Here I come to you.
[1:26:48] You're all together.
[1:26:54] All together.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is he wonderful to you this
[1:27:10] morning?
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. So good to
[1:27:15] meet you.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. It was only two months ago
[1:27:22] and God gave us a great opportunity to
[1:27:24] be back here again.
[1:27:27] God bless you.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I know you've had already a
[1:27:32] big morning and
[1:27:35] this fast, but
[1:27:38] we have a a little baby dedication.
[1:27:42] Brother Basaboszi would like to dedicate
[1:27:44] his little newest addition to his
[1:27:47] family.
[1:27:50] Amen.
[1:27:54] Amen. Amen.
[1:27:57] So why don't brother and his lovely
[1:27:59] family come today.
[1:28:04] Oh my.
[1:28:06] I love God loves life.
[1:28:10] God loves life.
[1:28:13] I just to me the birth of a little one,
[1:28:16] a little precious little soul that
[1:28:18] enters into this place we call time is
[1:28:21] to me a precious thing.
[1:28:26] So it'll be an honor this morning to
[1:28:28] you.
[1:28:30] Give back to God what God gave to you,
[1:28:34] his precious family. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:40] Here or here. Right. Wherever is all
[1:28:42] right.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Now look at this. God bless
[1:28:46] you.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Family. God bless you.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Well, you're going to have
[1:29:02] to hold a microphone for me.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. But just in a second. Okay.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; This is a special little one.
[1:29:09] I don't
[1:29:11] know how much I should say or will say.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Well, we had a a privilege. This
[1:29:19] precious little daughter that has been
[1:29:20] added to this family is named
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Esther
[1:29:27] Beth. Esther Beth Telster.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; You want the whole thing? Esther
[1:29:33] Bethlehem.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Esther Bethlehem.
[1:29:40] Amen. And what a what an honor. We were
[1:29:43] speaking with brother Abbas and little
[1:29:46] one who just arrived just on Tuesday, I
[1:29:48] think it was. That's correct.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Monday,
[1:29:53] forgive me. Landing and flying. I got it
[1:29:56] a couple days ago.
[1:30:02] Mother bus desired what? just desire a
[1:30:07] name for this little one. And we were
[1:30:09] able just to
[1:30:11] speak with brother Bus and communicate.
[1:30:14] And you started I said, "Brother Bus,
[1:30:16] what's the name of the children in your
[1:30:18] family?" And he started to go through
[1:30:20] the names
[1:30:25] of his daughters
[1:30:28] and each one and his sons. And each one
[1:30:30] was named from a a sister of the
[1:30:32] scripture.
[1:30:40] that we reach in and draw strength from.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; And so there's some powerful names here
[1:30:49] within this.
[1:30:54] And so he went with the little little
[1:30:56] one that arrived, this little daughter,
[1:31:01] just as I just said to brother Bus, I
[1:31:04] said, "But Bus, your family is named
[1:31:06] with women of scripture, women of
[1:31:07] faith."
[1:31:14] And it would be right maybe to stay
[1:31:16] within that inspiration within the
[1:31:17] within your family.
[1:31:23] And so the name Esther Bethlehem was
[1:31:25] what brother Bus and his wife so desired
[1:31:27] to name her.
[1:31:39] Esther is quite a sister of scripture.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; In Persian it means a star
[1:31:50] and we know the term Esther
[1:31:54] but in Hebrew
[1:31:56] Esther means a hidden one.
[1:32:02] And I think about the the message that
[1:32:04] brother Brandham speaks,
[1:32:07] a hidden life in Christ.
[1:32:11] And I just pray that this little one
[1:32:13] radiates,
[1:32:17] the life of Christ
[1:32:20] that is hidden
[1:32:23] within the house of God's brain,
[1:32:27] hidden within Bethlehem.
[1:32:31] the place where God dwells.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; That's where I want to be.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And may she may she draw
[1:32:41] from her name's sake
[1:32:46] because a name is an anointing.
[1:32:50] When you name a child, you're placing an
[1:32:53] anointing upon that child.
[1:32:57] And so it's not done, you know, very
[1:33:00] casually.
[1:33:04] And so you're praying it, you you find
[1:33:06] the inspiration that God has for this.
[1:33:12] May she be the brightest star in this
[1:33:14] life.
[1:33:19] In every family, sometimes we have our
[1:33:21] children. Different ones have different
[1:33:22] characteristics and
[1:33:29] But when she walks through your door,
[1:33:33] may the life of Christ radiate from you.
[1:33:39] Why do we pray?
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Wow. I hope some of you are jealous.
[1:33:55] Why don't we pray?
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, in my arms I hold life
[1:34:07] that you hold so precious to you.
[1:34:12] Lord, I think of the scriptures when you
[1:34:14] said suffer the little ones.
[1:34:18] Lord, you had a desire in your heart.
[1:34:22] You wanted to bless them.
[1:34:26] Lord, you wanted to lay your hands upon
[1:34:27] them,
[1:34:30] Lord, and give them blessings of
[1:34:31] strength.
[1:34:34] Lord, you you loved them. Lord, you even
[1:34:37] wanted our faith to be childlike.
[1:34:42] Heavenly Father, Lord, here brother Bus,
[1:34:45] his lovely wife, Lord, are giving this
[1:34:48] little bundle of treasure
[1:34:53] back to you,
[1:34:56] recognizing that you're the giver of
[1:34:58] life.
[1:35:00] So Lord, they dedicate this precious
[1:35:02] little one, Esther Bethlehem, to them.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, that you would take her in your
[1:35:08] arms, God.
[1:35:11] Lord, as I would be cradling her, may
[1:35:12] your arms cradle her,
[1:35:15] Lord. Year after year, may you guide her
[1:35:18] and lead her,
[1:35:21] Lord. May, Lord, you wrap such a
[1:35:22] protection around this little bundle.
[1:35:26] And you'd anoint her, oh God. anoint her
[1:35:29] as your name so speaks
[1:35:33] that she would radiate with the glory of
[1:35:35] God
[1:35:37] and her life would be a hidden light.
[1:35:41] Lord shut away
[1:35:43] shut in with God in a secret place. May
[1:35:47] it be behind the inner veil that she
[1:35:50] lives. Lord, the veil of the holiest of
[1:35:53] holies
[1:35:54] would drop behind her, the place of her
[1:35:57] passion, the place of her desire,
[1:36:01] the place of a refuge
[1:36:03] and be hidden within Christ,
[1:36:06] I dedicate her back to you.
[1:36:10] In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[1:36:26] God bless you.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; All right, let's turn to our Bibles.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; You've sang, you've worshiped.
[1:36:39] We've dedicated a little one back to
[1:36:41] him.
[1:36:44] But now the word takes preemptive.
[1:36:48] Amen.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to give room for our savior
[1:36:54] in the word this morning. Are you ready
[1:36:55] to pull a little bit?
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; I've preached a few times already.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; So, I'm kind of oiled up.
[1:37:06] I'm ready.
[1:37:08] But I sure hope you are.
[1:37:11] Are you ready this morning?
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. And let's turn to our
[1:37:15] scriptures in Numbers 13.
[1:37:20] Brother Bus supposedly said this
[1:37:22] morning, I said, "How long do you
[1:37:24] preach, brother Bus, on Sunday morning?"
[1:37:28] So he we just talking. He said, "Well,"
[1:37:31] he said, "there's no limits."
[1:37:37] Little did he know
[1:37:40] I'm preaching on the God of no limits.
[1:37:47] Amen. An unlimited God.
[1:37:52] Amen. So, let's dig into the word.
[1:37:56] Numbers 13
[1:37:59] 1-1 17.
[1:38:01] Quite a lengthy scripture.
[1:38:04] So, I'm just going to paraphrase my way
[1:38:06] through if I could and I'll let you sit
[1:38:07] down.
[1:38:10] But here it is in scripture
[1:38:12] that Moses was going to send the spies
[1:38:14] into Canaan.
[1:38:18] And he said unto them in verse 17,
[1:38:21] "Get you up this way southward and go up
[1:38:24] into the mountain."
[1:38:27] And Moses wanted them to go see the
[1:38:29] land.
[1:38:31] whether the people there are strong,
[1:38:35] whether they're weak, whether they're
[1:38:37] few, whether they're many. He says, "I
[1:38:41] want you to know what the the land that
[1:38:42] they dwell in.
[1:38:44] Is it good? Is it bad? Are the cities
[1:38:48] there? No. Are they tents? Are they
[1:38:51] strongholds?"
[1:38:54] Moses wanted to know this. He was very
[1:38:57] keen, VERY, VERY INTERESTED. IS IT FAT?
[1:39:01] Is it is it lean?
[1:39:05] He said, "Is there wood?" In verse 20,
[1:39:08] man. So Moses was very interested in the
[1:39:10] resources of the land.
[1:39:14] He said, "And be of good courage.
[1:39:16] Bring of the fruit of the land."
[1:39:20] Cuz now was the time
[1:39:23] of the first ripe grapes.
[1:39:26] Amen. Moses was very very focused on a
[1:39:29] certain thing.
[1:39:32] Let's bow our head in a word of prayer.
[1:39:35] Heavenly Father,
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're so desirous this morning
[1:39:38] that you would speak to us.
[1:39:41] Many are at church this morning,
[1:39:44] Lord, outside hearing different
[1:39:46] services, Lord, around here.
[1:39:48] Lord, we're not just desiring to come in
[1:39:50] in a form of tradition.
[1:39:53] We're not just desiring to come in a
[1:39:54] form of worship.
[1:39:57] But we're desiring to come that the God
[1:39:59] that we serve, the God that we believe,
[1:40:03] the God that lives amongst us, would
[1:40:05] come in our midst and dwell in the house
[1:40:08] of worship this morning. And Lord, you'd
[1:40:11] meet our needs.
[1:40:13] Lord, you'd meet our burdens. You lift
[1:40:15] us up in courage and strength. That you
[1:40:18] would prove one more time that you're a
[1:40:20] living God. Prove your word one more
[1:40:23] time. We commit it to you now in Jesus
[1:40:26] Christ's name.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated this morning.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Moses was interested.
[1:40:38] God bless you, brother Henry.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; How you doing?
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; I'm fine.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; You ready?
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Let's take off.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses was interested in this land.
[1:40:49] And so the spies they went up as you
[1:40:53] would read and you can just work with me
[1:40:54] through the scripture verse 21 and on.
[1:40:59] And so now they ascended into the south
[1:41:02] and they came into hein.
[1:41:04] They came to the brook of Eshko
[1:41:07] and they cut down a branch
[1:41:09] of cluster of grapes
[1:41:11] and they bare between two upon a
[1:41:15] brought it of the pomegranates
[1:41:17] and of the fig.
[1:41:21] and they returned of the from searching
[1:41:23] the land
[1:41:24] 40 days
[1:41:26] and they came to Aaron and Moses and of
[1:41:29] the congregation
[1:41:31] and of the children of Israel and
[1:41:34] brought back word unto them.
[1:41:37] Can you imagine the children of Israel
[1:41:40] were eagerly waiting a response?
[1:41:43] They were waiting 40 days
[1:41:46] over a month waiting. What? What are
[1:41:49] they seeing? Are they still okay?
[1:41:52] Are they alive?
[1:41:55] And here they START TO COME BACK. CAN
[1:41:58] YOU IMAGINE THAT MOMENT as they were
[1:41:59] carrying the grapes and pomegranates and
[1:42:02] figs on a staff?
[1:42:05] We're talking grapes. GRAPES.
[1:42:08] CAN YOU THINK OF THE EXCITEMENT?
[1:42:11] THEY'RE RETURNING. THEY COME BACK OUT OF
[1:42:14] THE LAND. THEY'VE GOT SOME FRUIT.
[1:42:17] THEY'VE GOT PROOF THAT IT'S A GOOD
[1:42:20] PLACE. SO THEY CROWD AROUND,
[1:42:24] let them through. LET THEM THROUGH.
[1:42:27] Moses and Aaron.
[1:42:29] So they here come to this place and they
[1:42:32] say they show it to THEM AND THEY TELL
[1:42:36] THEM WE CAME FROM THE LAND WHICH THOU
[1:42:40] sent us AND SURELY
[1:42:43] SURELY THEY WERE TESTIFYING
[1:42:46] OF THE GOODNESS IN THE LAND.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; SURELY I'VE WALKED THROUGH IT.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; I'VE WENT THROUGH THE LAND AND IT'S
[1:42:55] GOOD. HALLELUJAH. They had a little
[1:42:58] TASTE
[1:43:00] and the scripture says it flowth with
[1:43:04] milk and honey and this is the fruit of
[1:43:07] it.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Who has your Bibles open?
[1:43:15] Who has your Bibles open?
[1:43:18] Verse 28
[1:43:21] of chapter 13 in Numbers.
[1:43:24] Can you read for me the first word?
[1:43:30] Can Yeah.
[1:43:32] All right. Everybody did it. Thank you.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; They all helped you out.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Never the less.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless.
[1:43:48] That's what it says.
[1:43:51] IMMEDIATELY
[1:43:53] THEY put a limit.
[1:43:58] Surely the LAND IS GOOD
[1:44:02] AND GROWETH MILK AND HONEY, BUT
[1:44:05] nevertheless
[1:44:08] the people ARE STRONG.
[1:44:11] NEVERTHELESS,
[1:44:13] THE cities are wall.
[1:44:16] NEVERTHELESS, THE WALLS ARE GREAT.
[1:44:19] AND MOREOVER,
[1:44:21] THERE'S GIANTS.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; SO WHERE THEY WERE EAGER,
[1:44:28] THEY'RE RETURNING, THEY'RE RETURNING.
[1:44:35] Suddenly the water just went on the
[1:44:37] fire.
[1:44:41] The Amalachites dwell in the land. The
[1:44:44] Hittites dwell in the land. The Jebites
[1:44:46] dwell in the land.
[1:44:48] It's not empty.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; IT'S FULL OF BELLS.
[1:44:53] It's full of the Amorites.
[1:44:55] It's full OF THE CANAANITES.
[1:44:57] IT'S FULL OF HOLLYWOOD.
[1:44:59] IT'S FULL OF MUSIC. IT'S FULL OF ALL THE
[1:45:02] PERVERSION. IT'S FULL OF SO MANY
[1:45:04] BATTLES.
[1:45:07] NEVERTHELESS,
[1:45:10] NEVERTHELESS, IMPOSSIBLE.
[1:45:19] But verse 30 says,
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; actually I'm not going to read you verse
[1:45:24] 30.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to wait
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; because humanity is transfixed
[1:45:33] with the world
[1:45:35] and desiring to find resources.
[1:45:40] Moses was LOOKING FOR RESOURCES.
[1:45:43] HE WAS ASKING THEM, "IS there wood?
[1:45:46] Are they what's in the city? Is it a fat
[1:45:49] land? Is it a lean land?" And the
[1:45:53] world's no different.
[1:45:56] The world has fought battles for
[1:45:57] resources.
[1:46:00] Spain traveled to America for gold.
[1:46:04] England, France, Rome.
[1:46:07] They've conquered for every COMMODITY
[1:46:09] UNDER THE SUN.
[1:46:11] EVERYBODY WANTS A RESOURCE.
[1:46:14] AMEN. AMEN. Many have come into into
[1:46:17] into Africa because Africa is full of
[1:46:19] resources.
[1:46:22] You have an abundance of resources
[1:46:25] AND PEOPLE WANT IT.
[1:46:28] MAN WANTS RESOURCES.
[1:46:31] And so they wage war
[1:46:34] to conquer, to try and take,
[1:46:38] to gain.
[1:46:40] And so they'll move they'll spend
[1:46:41] thousands and millions of dollars
[1:46:45] because without resources
[1:46:47] a kingdom will fall.
[1:46:50] Without resources your economy suffers
[1:46:54] without resources there's no growth.
[1:46:58] You need food. You need wood.
[1:47:01] You need money. You need minerals.
[1:47:04] You need
[1:47:07] you need grain. You need rice.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; America
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; fought the revolution.
[1:47:16] They fought for freedom.
[1:47:19] They say, "AH, WE FOUGHT FOR FREEDOM."
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; YEAH. But England actually wasn't
[1:47:23] looking at that way.
[1:47:26] England was fighting that war for the
[1:47:28] resources.
[1:47:33] And man has realized that there's a
[1:47:35] limit in resources.
[1:47:40] So who's heard the term renewable
[1:47:41] resource?
[1:47:48] No. Nobody.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Renewable energy.
[1:48:07] renewable energy.
[1:48:10] Yeah. Like water
[1:48:12] or wind, you know, they have a wind
[1:48:14] turbine that can spin with the wind and
[1:48:16] generate power
[1:48:19] because wind is renewable.
[1:48:23] So man is looking for something that's
[1:48:25] renewable,
[1:48:27] continuous,
[1:48:28] always there.
[1:48:30] The water will always flow.
[1:48:33] It generates electricity through a dam
[1:48:37] because man realizes that we're of
[1:48:39] limited supply
[1:48:43] of certain resources.
[1:48:46] Our
[1:48:48] body has limited resource.
[1:48:54] Anybody that's getting a little older
[1:48:55] can realize that I don't quite have the
[1:48:57] same resources inside.
[1:49:02] That I used to have.
[1:49:05] So man is always hunting FOR MORE.
[1:49:09] HOW CAN I extend my years just a little
[1:49:12] bit?
[1:49:14] you know, how can I tap? Is there a
[1:49:16] little more potential inside of me,
[1:49:21] right? Or so keen on that.
[1:49:24] AND that's why they make so many books
[1:49:26] and movies.
[1:49:28] They they want super abilities,
[1:49:32] TAP tap into some resource or potential,
[1:49:37] right? some superhero
[1:49:40] THAT WAKES UP SUDDENLY
[1:49:42] AND HE'S A SUPERMAN
[1:49:45] SOMEWHERE INSIDE SOME ABILITY SPRUNG UP.
[1:49:52] Man desires it so bad.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Let me define for you
[1:49:59] limited.
[1:50:02] You know what limited is?
[1:50:06] It's small,
[1:50:09] restricted in size.
[1:50:14] It's it's meager.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; It's scanty.
[1:50:20] It's deficient.
[1:50:23] It's insufficient.
[1:50:26] It's patchy.
[1:50:29] BASIC
[1:50:32] FINITE
[1:50:36] in short supply.
[1:50:41] Does that define it good enough for you?
[1:50:46] It's hard for our human mind
[1:50:49] to comprehend unlimited.
[1:50:54] IT'S HARD FOR US BECAUSE WE'RE CREATURES
[1:50:56] OF TIME.
[1:50:58] SO THERE'S A LIMIT OF TIME.
[1:51:01] WE'RE creatures that live by money.
[1:51:04] And so we we understand there's limits
[1:51:05] there.
[1:51:08] There's a limits of our strength.
[1:51:10] There's a limits of our body.
[1:51:13] AND SO BECAUSE OF OUR HUMAN MENTALITY,
[1:51:16] WE we tend to try and measure
[1:51:18] everything.
[1:51:21] We have scales
[1:51:23] because we need to see how much this
[1:51:25] weighs.
[1:51:26] Is this small amount? Is this a big
[1:51:29] amount? And we have a graduating scale
[1:51:33] from super teeny, super small
[1:51:37] to great and large,
[1:51:39] right? So we understand the limits.
[1:51:45] You know, you care about limits actually
[1:51:48] or should you care about a measurement
[1:51:52] because you would care if someone says,
[1:51:54] "Well, here's $10
[1:51:58] or here's$10 billion."
[1:52:02] Would you care?
[1:52:05] You'd be pretty happy. There's a unit of
[1:52:07] measurement there.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; It doesn't really matter. I'll take $10
[1:52:13] or 10 billion. It doesn't matter.
[1:52:19] It matters to you.
[1:52:24] It matters.
[1:52:26] Amen. And so we care. So God, you know,
[1:52:28] but if I COULD SAY GOD THOUGH
[1:52:31] IS NOT A MAN THAT IS RESTRICTED TO HUMAN
[1:52:36] LIMITATION.
[1:52:38] HE DOESN'T HAVE A UNIT OF MEASUREMENT.
[1:52:42] BUT we tend TO LOOK AT GOD THROUGH OUR
[1:52:45] EYES OF HUMANITY
[1:52:47] AND WE RESTRICT HIM TO OUR OWN BARRIER,
[1:52:53] OUR OWN LIMIT
[1:52:55] OR OUR OWN ABILITY.
[1:52:58] Is that true? It's because we HAVE A
[1:53:01] HARD TIME understanding
[1:53:04] unlimited
[1:53:06] or no limits.
[1:53:10] Because no limits
[1:53:12] or the UNLIMITED GOD
[1:53:15] MEANS HE'S THE INEXHAUSTIBLE GOD.
[1:53:18] HE'S THE LIMITLESS GOD. HE'S THE
[1:53:21] UNFAILING GOD. HE'S THE MEASURLESS GOD.
[1:53:26] HE'S THE UNRESTRICTED GOD. HE'S THE
[1:53:29] UNCONSTRAINED GOD. HE'S THE UNRESTRAINED
[1:53:32] GOD. HE'S UNCONDITIONAL.
[1:53:35] HE'S ABSOLUTE. HE'S SUPREME. HE'S
[1:53:39] SOVEREIGN.
[1:53:41] HE'S OMNIPOTENT.
[1:53:43] HE'S UNMEASURABLE.
[1:53:46] THAT'S MY UNLIMITED GOD.
[1:53:49] DON'T BOX HIM IN. DON'T PUT HIM IN OUR
[1:53:52] ABILITIES.
[1:53:54] BUT REALIZE YOU SERVE A DIFFERENT GOD.
[1:53:57] HE'S NO GOD OF STONE THIS MORNING. HE'S
[1:53:59] HE'S NOT A GOD OF STONE. HE'S NOT A GOD
[1:54:02] OF WOOD THAT IS LIMITED TO NOTHING.
[1:54:07] BUT MY GOD IS ABLE. HE'S BOTTOMLESS.
[1:54:12] HE'S INCALCULABLE.
[1:54:14] HE'S EVERLASTING.
[1:54:16] HE'S IMMENSE.
[1:54:18] HE'S VAST.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; HE'S GREAT.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; HE'S SUPREME.
[1:54:24] MY GOD IS UNBRIDLED.
[1:54:30] I gave you a word for every one of you.
[1:54:37] You can take just take ONE OF THOSE
[1:54:39] WORDS, WALK OUT THIS DOOR AFTER THIS
[1:54:43] SERVICE AND SAY, "I SERVE A SOVEREIGN
[1:54:46] OMNIPOTENT GOD."
[1:54:51] AMEN.
[1:54:54] There's no unit of measurement FOR GOD.
[1:54:58] GOD doesn't be like, "Well,
[1:55:01] that toothache is a piece of cake.
[1:55:04] IT'S SUCH A SMALL problem to me.
[1:55:08] But that cancer,
[1:55:12] man, that's a real struggle.
[1:55:14] I MEAN, I GOT TO work really hard.
[1:55:18] I got to really FIGURE OUT HOW TO TACKLE
[1:55:19] THAT CANCER.
[1:55:22] THERE'S NO UNIT OF MEASUREMENT TO GOD.
[1:55:24] WHETHER IT'S A TOOTHACHE OR A HEADACHE
[1:55:28] OR A CANCER OR A DEAD BODY
[1:55:32] OR A LOST AND WEWARD SON OR DAUGHTER.
[1:55:36] GOD DON'T CARE. IT'S ALL THE SAME TO
[1:55:39] HIM. HE'S UNLIMITED.
[1:55:42] DON'T MEASURE HIM. DON'T TELL YOU, WELL,
[1:55:45] THIS IS SO SMALL. THIS IS SO BIG.
[1:55:49] HE'S ALL GOD. ALL YOUR PROBLEMS
[1:55:53] BECAUSE scripture says and Jesus LOOKING
[1:55:56] UNTO THEM SAID
[1:55:58] WITH MEN
[1:56:00] WITH MEN IT'S IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE MEN ARE
[1:56:04] LIMITED
[1:56:06] MEN ARE BOUND MEN HAVE A A LIMIT
[1:56:10] BUT WITH GOD
[1:56:13] ALL THINGS
[1:56:15] NOT SOMETHING NOT A FEW THINGS NOT
[1:56:18] ALMOST EVERYTHING
[1:56:21] ALL THINGS
[1:56:23] ARE POSSIBLE.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; There isn't a problem in this room.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; THERE ISN'T A SITUATION IN THIS ROOM
[1:56:35] THAT GOD CANNOT take care of.
[1:56:40] DON'T YOU SIT THERE AND GO, "THIS IS A
[1:56:43] PRETTY TOUGH ONE FOR GOD." IT'S NOT
[1:56:45] TOUGH FOR GOD. GOD GOD DON'T KNOW TOUGH.
[1:56:50] GOD DOESN'T KNOW DIFFICULT.
[1:56:53] GOD DOESN'T KNOW COMPLICATED.
[1:56:55] WITH GOD, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
[1:57:00] HALLELUJAH.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says, "WHEN THE BRETHREN
[1:57:06] RECEIVED THE BAPTISM of the Holy Ghost,
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; HE SAID THIS IS THE SUMMIT.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE PEAK."
[1:57:14] BUT BRETHREN, THAT'S WRONG.
[1:57:17] HE SAID THERE'S NO SUMMIT TO GOD'S
[1:57:19] POWER.
[1:57:21] YOU COULD REACH THE MOUNT EVEREST OF
[1:57:23] GOD'S POWER
[1:57:27] AND AND MAN WOULD THINK THEY'RE ON TOP,
[1:57:31] BUT WITH GOD, JUST KEEP GOING.
[1:57:35] YOU COULD STAND ON THE MOON OF GOD'S
[1:57:36] POWER
[1:57:38] AND YOU'D THINK YOU'RE ON TOP, BUT JUST
[1:57:41] KEEP GOING. YOU CAN STAND ON THE SUN AND
[1:57:44] THINK YOU'VE REACHED THE PEAK OF GOD'S
[1:57:46] POWER, BUT KEEP GOING. KEEP GOING INTO
[1:57:49] ETERNITY AND ETERNITY AND ETERNITY.
[1:57:53] THAT'S GOD'S POWER.
[1:58:00] HE SAID WE MOVE ON AND ON. IT'S THE
[1:58:04] UNLIMITED
[1:58:06] RESOURCES
[1:58:10] OF GOD.
[1:58:12] THAT HAS never
[1:58:15] I want you to think about this. This is
[1:58:17] a quote. This is from the PROPHET OF
[1:58:20] GOD. HE SAID, "The unlimited resources
[1:58:23] of God
[1:58:26] has never been tapped.
[1:58:33] Do you know how many problems
[1:58:36] that have transpired
[1:58:38] on the earth over 6,000 plus years?
[1:58:43] Can we just Can we even figure out a
[1:58:46] number?
[1:58:50] How many problems do you have? How many
[1:58:53] PRAYERS HAVE YOU PRAYED? I CAN TELL you
[1:58:55] you have more than one.
[1:58:58] You have more than one problem.
[1:59:01] True.
[1:59:02] You have A BUNDLE OF PRAYERS.
[1:59:05] YOU HAVE A BUNDLE OF NEEDS.
[1:59:07] AND THERE'S 8 BILLION PLUS PEOPLE ON
[1:59:09] THIS PLANET.
[1:59:12] THAT MEANS THERE'S BILLIONS AND BILLIONS
[1:59:16] OF NEEDS RIGHT NOW.
[1:59:19] RIGHT NOW
[1:59:20] AND OVER 6,000 YEARS, HOW MANY BILLIONS
[1:59:24] OF PEOPLE HAVE LIVED ON THIS EARTH
[1:59:28] THAT HAVE HAVE HAD BUNDLES OF PROBLEMS
[1:59:32] AND THEY'VE PRAYED TO A GOD AND HE'S
[1:59:35] NEVER BEEN UNTAPPED.
[1:59:40] HE'S NEVER BEEN TAPPED OUT.
[1:59:44] YOU THINK YOU'RE COMING TO THE END OF
[1:59:45] IT.
[1:59:47] YOU THINK YOU'RE COMING TO THE
[1:59:48] EXPIRATION?
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; God's thermometer.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:59:57] It's 2026.
[2:00:00] I'm almost at my limit.
[2:00:04] IS GOD WONDERING, "OH MAN, CAN I MAKE IT
[2:00:07] THROUGH 2026?
[2:00:10] DO I have enough IN ME
[2:00:13] TO MEET THE NEEDS OF MY PEOPLE?
[2:00:17] GOD ISN'T DOING THAT. GOD'S NOT LOOKING
[2:00:19] AT NO MEASUREMENT.
[2:00:22] WHAT YOU NEED IN 2022
[2:00:25] IN TOMORROW,
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; NEXT MONTH, NEXT YEAR, GOD WILL STILL BE
[2:00:32] ABLE TO MEET IT.
[2:00:35] AMEN.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; The problem was
[2:00:48] The problem was
[2:00:50] at Kadesh Barnea there
[2:00:53] when Israel went over into the land and
[2:00:56] here the 12 men came came back
[2:00:58] and they put this this limit on God
[2:01:00] immediately
[2:01:02] and if I could continue to down to the
[2:01:06] end of chapter
[2:01:09] verse 30 chapter 13
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad glad there was a different
[2:01:15] PERSON THERE.
[2:01:18] I'M so glad it didn't end it at
[2:01:19] nevertheless
[2:01:21] because you hear A LOT OF DOUBT. YOU
[2:01:24] HEAR A LOT OF ISSUES.
[2:01:26] YOU HEAR A LOT OF COMPLAINTS.
[2:01:28] YOU HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING, "OH,
[2:01:29] THE MESSAGE IS THIS. THE MESSAGE IS THAT
[2:01:32] WE CAN'T DO THIS AND WE CAN'T DO THAT."
[2:01:35] BUT CALEB,
[2:01:37] CALEB STILL THE PEOPLE,
[2:01:40] "STOP."
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let us GO UP
[2:01:47] AND POSSESS IT, FOR WE'RE MORE THAN ABLE
[2:01:51] TO OVERCOME IT."
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; He's all alone.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Is anybody with me?
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Him and Joshua.
[2:02:02] Joshua and him. Caleb.
[2:02:05] And they say, "Well, no, no, no, no. But
[2:02:08] the men that went up,
[2:02:10] CALEB, BE QUIET.
[2:02:13] WE are not able TO GO UP AGAINST YOU.
[2:02:17] FOR THEY, the giants, ARE STRONGER,
[2:02:21] THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, than we.
[2:02:28] Wait a second.
[2:02:31] We are not able to go against the
[2:02:33] people,
[2:02:35] for they are stronger
[2:02:37] than we.
[2:02:41] They had missed the POINT
[2:02:46] in this MOMENT AFTER THEY'D GONE THROUGH
[2:02:49] PLAGUE AFTER PLAGUE. MIRACLE AFTER
[2:02:51] MIRACLE, RED SEA OPENING,
[2:02:55] ALL THE QUAIL AND THE MANA
[2:02:58] AND SUDDENLY AT THIS HOUR THEY'D MISSED.
[2:03:02] IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM.
[2:03:06] WHAT HAD THEY DONE ALL THROUGH THE PAST?
[2:03:09] DID THEY PART THE RED SEA?
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; DID THEY BRING QUAIL OUT OF THE AIR?
[2:03:15] DID THEY SMITE THE FIRSTBORN?
[2:03:18] BUT SUDDENLY, OH, THE GIANTS ARE
[2:03:21] STRONGER THAN WE.
[2:03:30] THEY HAD COMPLETELY
[2:03:32] DISREGARDED
[2:03:34] THE FACT THE FACT THAT THE PILLAR OF
[2:03:38] FIRE WAS IN THEIR MIDST.
[2:03:42] THE PILLAR OF THE CLOUD WAS IN THEIR
[2:03:44] MIDST AND THEY DISREGARDED IT. THEY
[2:03:48] TURNED THEIR BACK ON IT AND SAID, "OH,
[2:03:51] IT'S STRONGER THAN US."
[2:03:57] They had a pillar of fire by night and a
[2:03:59] CLOUD BY DAY.
[2:04:01] AND THEY BRING AN E THEY BRING AN EVIL
[2:04:03] REPORT
[2:04:05] AND THEY SAY WE CAN'T DO THIS. THERE'S
[2:04:08] GIANTS THERE. IN FACT, LET US GO BACK TO
[2:04:11] EGYPT.
[2:04:13] LET'S get us another captain.
[2:04:17] Can you imagine
[2:04:19] the pillar of fire?
[2:04:22] The pillar of fire hanging here RIGHT
[2:04:23] NOW
[2:04:25] AND THE WHOLE group says, "Forget it. It
[2:04:28] didn't do anything for us.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; He didn't deliver us.
[2:04:33] WE'RE GOING BACK TO FLORIDA.
[2:04:36] FORGET MOSES. We need a new captain.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; They completely disregarded,
[2:04:46] the resource,
[2:04:48] the unlimited resource
[2:04:51] that was sitting in their midst.
[2:04:56] And that was their critical
[2:04:59] FATAL
[2:05:02] error
[2:05:04] that they made there.
[2:05:07] God never forgot it.
[2:05:12] But I'm glad the story doesn't end THERE
[2:05:16] BECAUSE JOSHUA COULD SAY, "AS FOR ME IN
[2:05:17] MY HOUSE,
[2:05:19] CALEB COULD SAY, "AS FOR ME IN MY HOUSE,
[2:05:22] I DON'T CARE WHO TURNS BACK. I DON'T
[2:05:25] CARE WHO FALLS AWAY. IF THEY FALL AWAY
[2:05:28] AND THEY FALL AWAY, BUT ME, I RECOGNIZE
[2:05:32] THE PILLAR OF FIRE IN THIS HOUR. I
[2:05:36] RECOGNIZE THERE'S A CLOUD THAT CAME IN
[2:05:38] THIS HOUR TO VINDICATE THAT THE SAME
[2:05:41] UNLIMITED GOD IS HERE IN THIS HOUR
[2:05:45] LEADING YOU, leading you, LEADING ME, I
[2:05:50] WILL NOT DISREGARD THAT HE'S UNLIMITED.
[2:05:54] AND IF HE CAN LEAD CALEB OUT OF A LAND,
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; HE CAN LEAD YOU AND I
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; INTO GLORY.
[2:06:03] HALLELUJAH.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; That's why Romans 8,
[2:06:10] that's why Paul quoted for you and me.
[2:06:14] For who HE DID FORNO,
[2:06:16] HE DID PREDESTINATE
[2:06:18] TO be conformed to the IMAGE OF HIS SON
[2:06:22] THAT HE MIGHT be the firstborn among
[2:06:24] many brethren.
[2:06:26] Moreover, whom he did predestinate them
[2:06:29] he also called. WHOM HE CALLED, HE ALSO
[2:06:32] JUSTIFIED WHOM HE JUSTIFIED, HE ALSO
[2:06:35] GLORIFIED. WHAT SHALL WE SAY THEN TO
[2:06:38] THESE SAINTS?
[2:06:42] If God BEFORE US,
[2:06:45] WHO?
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; ANIC,
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; THE GIANTS,
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; HOLLYWOOD,
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; YOUR ISSUE,
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; your issue,
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; YOUR ISSUE,
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; YOUR PROBLEM.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE THAT BEFORE GOD?
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; CAN THAT STAND BEFORE YOU,
[2:07:04] BEFORE THE PREDESTINATED,
[2:07:06] BEFORE THE JUSTIFIED,
[2:07:09] BEFORE THE TO BE GLORIFIED?
[2:07:12] WHAT CAN WE SAY THEN? GOD BEFORE YOU.
[2:07:16] WHO CAN BE AGAINST YOU?
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; I want you TO WALK THIS MORNING.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO WALK THIS MORNING.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO BE LIKE CALEB THIS MORNING
[2:07:28] THAT WHEN HE WALKED INTO THAT LAND, HE
[2:07:31] WAS LOOKING AT THE RESOURCES.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; He was LOOKING AT A GOD
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; WITH NO limits all around him.
[2:07:46] Hallelujah.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Israel
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; looked across
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; and they looked at the joy
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; that was set before them
[2:07:59] and said, "It's not possible.
[2:08:02] There's no way for me to have my joy.
[2:08:05] There's no way for me to have my peace.
[2:08:09] I can't do it.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; It's greater than me.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; I don't have the strength.
[2:08:20] Meanwhile, Caleb,
[2:08:23] he said, "Oh, God.
[2:08:26] It's not my strength. It's not my
[2:08:28] ability.
[2:08:29] I'm I'm getting older,
[2:08:32] but you promised it
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; and you're the unlimited God. You made
[2:08:35] the promise. I know you can deliver it.
[2:08:38] My frailties mean nothing. My weaknesses
[2:08:41] mean nothing. I need to get WEAKER SO
[2:08:44] YOU CAN BECOME STRONGER THROUGH MY
[2:08:46] WEAKNESS.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; You know, it's a terrible thing.
[2:08:54] It is a terrible thing.
[2:08:57] When you see somebody
[2:09:00] and they're achieving below their
[2:09:02] ability.
[2:09:06] You ever SEEN SOMEBODY
[2:09:08] AND and they're underachieving,
[2:09:12] you know, there's more that they can do,
[2:09:16] but but they're down here
[2:09:19] and you're just like, you need to press
[2:09:21] forward.
[2:09:24] You know, maybe there's a TALENT THERE.
[2:09:28] AND THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT REACHING to
[2:09:30] really press into that gift God has for
[2:09:32] them.
[2:09:36] It seems like it's just it's within
[2:09:37] reach, but they don't know it and they
[2:09:38] don't achieve it.
[2:09:42] That's terrible.
[2:09:44] someone living underneath their
[2:09:46] god-given privileges.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; In second Kings,
[2:09:55] 2 Kings 7, there's a group of men
[2:10:00] and they sat there in kind of one of
[2:10:02] those moments
[2:10:05] and there had been a terrible FAMINE IN
[2:10:06] THE LAND.
[2:10:08] THEY WERE UNDER SIEGE.
[2:10:11] SATAN HAD BEEN ALL AROUND THEM.
[2:10:14] ENCOMPASSED THEIR CITY.
[2:10:16] IT WAS A DARK TIME. MAYBE IT WAS A LESS
[2:10:19] SEA OF DARKNESS. AND THERE WAS A GROUP
[2:10:21] OF MEN THAT SAT THERE AND they were
[2:10:25] lepers
[2:10:27] and they HAD NOWHERE TO GO. ALL THE
[2:10:30] RESOURCES WERE GONE.
[2:10:32] NOTHING TO EAT NO MORE. EVERYTHING WAS
[2:10:35] OUT OF REACH.
[2:10:37] Or so they thought.
[2:10:41] As far AS THEY KNEW,
[2:10:44] WE'RE GOING TO DIE HERE.
[2:10:46] WE WAIT. WHAT? WHY? IF WE SIT HERE, WE
[2:10:49] DIE. IF WE GO TO THE SYRIAN, WE DIE.
[2:10:54] WHY DON'T WE JUST GO TO THEM AND ASK?
[2:10:57] WHAT WHAT DO WE HAVE to lose?
[2:10:59] You know, THERE'S AN ABUNDANCE OVER
[2:11:01] THERE AND MAYBE THEY'LL GIVE IT TO US.
[2:11:04] BUT THEY WERE UNAWARE
[2:11:06] THAT A PROPHECY HAD ALREADY BEEN GIVEN
[2:11:08] OUT.
[2:11:09] GOD HAD ALREADY PROVIDED
[2:11:12] AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT YET.
[2:11:15] CAN YOU IMAGINE THIS MORNING IF YOU
[2:11:17] COULD BE SITTING LIKE A LEPER? REALIZING
[2:11:19] GOD HAS ALREADY DECREED THROUGH OUR
[2:11:22] MESSAGE OF THIS HOUR, HE'S ALREADY
[2:11:24] PROVIDED,
[2:11:26] BUT DON'T BE SITTING LIKE A LEPER
[2:11:28] SAYING, "WELL, I'M JUST CONTENT TO SIT
[2:11:31] HERE."
[2:11:32] GET UP AND HAVE WHAT THEY SAID. THEY
[2:11:36] SAID, "WHY SIT HERE TILL WE DIE? WHAT
[2:11:41] I'M DOING RIGHT NOW ISN'T DOING ANY
[2:11:43] GOOD. I WONDER WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING.
[2:11:47] MAYBE WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING, GOD'S
[2:11:49] ASKING YOU TO GET OUT, GOD'S CALLING
[2:11:51] YOU. STEP FORWARD. GET OUT OF THE PLACE
[2:11:54] WHERE YOU'VE BEEN. GET OUT OF THE
[2:11:56] STAGNATED MEMORY THAT YOU'RE IN.
[2:11:58] BREAKTHROUGH."
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; AH, WELL,
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; they're going to kill us.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; You know
[2:12:12] what? If we, you know, they've been HERE
[2:12:14] FOR YEARS, AND
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN TRYING FOR YEARS, Brother
[2:12:17] Michael.
[2:12:19] I've tried to serve God, BUT SEEMS LIKE
[2:12:21] NOTHING'S REALLY HAPPENED in my life.
[2:12:22] YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW, BROTHER MICHAEL.
[2:12:24] I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN REALLY FULLY
[2:12:25] SURRENDER. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW,
[2:12:27] BROTHER MICHAEL. IF I DO THAT, MAYBE MY
[2:12:30] FRIENDS WILL LEAVE ME. MAYBE MY FAMILY
[2:12:33] WILL FORSAKE ME. MAY MAYBE THEY'LL MOCK
[2:12:36] ME.
[2:12:38] WHAT EXCUSE?
[2:12:40] I ASK YOU, WHAT EXCUSE
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; IS WORTH
[2:12:46] NOT GETTING THE RESOURCES GOD HAS FOR
[2:12:48] YOU?
[2:12:56] Those four lepers could give a lot of
[2:12:58] excuses.
[2:13:00] Oh, they might kill us.
[2:13:03] They might they might KILL US RIGHT AT
[2:13:04] THE DOOR.
[2:13:06] YOU KNOW, THEY MIGHT THEY MIGHT DO, YOU
[2:13:07] KNOW, BUT THEY'RE SAYING, "BUT WHAT'S
[2:13:09] THERE TO LOSE?
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THERE TO LOSE?"
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW. IS IT
[2:13:14] WORKING FOR YOU?
[2:13:18] CUZ THEN GET UP. WHY SIT HERE? WHY SIT
[2:13:22] IN THE MUCK?
[2:13:24] WHY SIT LOST AND WRETCHED?
[2:13:26] WHY SIT THERE AS A MEDIOCRE LIFE AS A
[2:13:28] MESSAGE GIRL OR AS A MESSAGE BOY?
[2:13:32] JUST JUST PLOTTING AS A MESSAGE. GOOD
[2:13:34] BELIEVER.
[2:13:36] GOD HAS MORE FOR YOU,
[2:13:39] GET UP. WHY SIT HERE TILL YOU DIE LIKE A
[2:13:44] RICH YOUNG RULER? THAT'S NOT YOUR
[2:13:46] CALLING. YOUR CALLING IS TO GET UP AND
[2:13:51] ATTAIN.
[2:13:54] Why sit here bound WITH SOME MALICE?
[2:13:57] WHY SIT HERE BOUND BY SOME HURT?
[2:14:00] WHY SIT HERE BOUND TO SOME PAST
[2:14:02] CIRCUMSTANCE
[2:14:03] THAT HAS WOUNDED YOU?
[2:14:06] That your spirit is hurt?
[2:14:10] WHAT EXCUSE?
[2:14:12] IF YOU COULD stand before God and God is
[2:14:14] saying, "I'VE GOT RESOURCES. I'VE GOT
[2:14:17] HEALING FOR YOU. HEALING FOR BODY,
[2:14:20] HEALING FOR SOUL, HEALING FOR SPIRIT."
[2:14:24] AND YOU STAND BEFORE HIM AND SAY, "WELL,
[2:14:28] so and so said this to me,
[2:14:31] and I couldn't go any more further."
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; That's a good enough excuse.
[2:14:42] GET UP
[2:14:44] AND RETAIN.
[2:14:46] GET UP AND TAKE WHAT'S YOURS. GET UP AND
[2:14:50] GET INTO THE PROMISED LAND. GET UP AND
[2:14:53] RECEIVE WHAT GOD GIVE YOU.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; They were willing
[2:15:04] to do that,
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; not even knowing it was prophesied.
[2:15:12] WHAT ABOUT YOU AND I who know it's
[2:15:15] there?
[2:15:18] Why would we sit here in this
[2:15:21] in this ecstatic place of our life?
[2:15:25] Let's press forward.
[2:15:30] Brother says, "Choose you this day who
[2:15:31] you'll serve."
[2:15:34] THE HOUR HAS COME FOR A DECISION to be
[2:15:37] made.
[2:15:38] He says, "What more CAN GOD DO?"
[2:15:41] HE SENT down signs and wonders,
[2:15:44] DISCERNMENTS,
[2:15:46] PROVED IT SCIENTIFICALLY.
[2:15:48] PUT IT ON A PICTURE,
[2:15:50] SEND IT ACROSS THE WORLD.
[2:15:53] THOUSANDS TIMES THOUSANDS
[2:15:55] ARE WITNESSING. But he said, "What about
[2:15:58] you?"
[2:16:01] He says, "They arose in the middle OF
[2:16:02] THE NIGHT AND WALKING BY FAITH TOWARDS
[2:16:05] THE HOST OF SYRIANS."
[2:16:08] AND GOD honored their faith.
[2:16:11] And you know what happened? They started
[2:16:14] to reap.
[2:16:16] I mean, they must have been RUNNING
[2:16:17] AROUND THE TENT. LOOK AT THIS JACKET.
[2:16:19] LOOK AT THIS GARMENT. LOOK AT THIS GOLD.
[2:16:22] LOOK AT THIS GOODNESS.
[2:16:24] THEY STARTED TO HIDE IT.
[2:16:27] Hide it. Someone else IS GOING TO COME.
[2:16:30] WELL, wait a second. THEY SAID, "WAIT A
[2:16:33] SECOND.
[2:16:34] THIS ISN'T RIGHT.
[2:16:37] You mean God gave US ALL THIS FOOD?
[2:16:40] YOU MEAN GOD GAVE US THIS WHOLE MESSAGE
[2:16:42] AND THIS WORD OPEN UP IN THIS LAST DAY?
[2:16:45] I MEAN, GOD POURED IT OUT FOR US.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T HOLD IT IN.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T HOLD IT IN, BROTHER.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO GET IT OUT.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO SPREAD THE JOY.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO SPREAD THE FOOD. WE GOT TO
[2:17:00] SPREAD THE GARMENT OF THIS WORD AROUND
[2:17:03] THE WORLD.
[2:17:07] FOUR LEPERS
[2:17:09] GOT THE VISION OF GETTING A MESSAGE OUT.
[2:17:13] MAY I BE LIKE ONE OF THEM LEOPARDS THAT
[2:17:15] GOD HAS MADE WHOLE AND IN THIS HOUR
[2:17:18] CATCH THE VISION THAT I NEED TO GET THIS
[2:17:21] WORD OUT
[2:17:23] BOOK BY BOOK MESSAGE BY MESSAGE TRACK BY
[2:17:27] TRACK
[2:17:28] LIFE BY LIFE.
[2:17:33] Let let the book live in me. Dear Lord,
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; SHOW ME MYSELF
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; WITHIN THY WORD.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; There's no more siege on the name of our
[2:17:58] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:18:02] Oh,
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Trinity tried for a long time.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; No more.
[2:18:09] There's no more siege on merit,
[2:18:13] my ability, and my actions.
[2:18:16] Grace stepped in.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO SIEGE.
[2:18:21] SYRIANS HAVE NOT SELECT
[2:18:28] around the SIN IN THE GARDEN. THEY
[2:18:30] DIDN'T KNOW APPLE IN THE GARDEN.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW WHAT IT IS. WHY? BECAUSE GOD
[2:18:36] BROUGHT RESOURCES.
[2:18:38] INTO THIS HOUR.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm tapping into.
[2:18:50] But Abraham says in the church and you
[2:18:52] sitting here tonight,
[2:18:55] he says you're struggling and struggling
[2:18:59] and God's pulling you
[2:19:02] to showing you things.
[2:19:05] you can get past that sin barrier of
[2:19:08] unbelief,
[2:19:12] then unlimited revival will break out
[2:19:15] through THE UNITED STATES AND
[2:19:18] EVERYWHERE.
[2:19:26] He said until you break through and the
[2:19:29] Holy Ghost comes upon you,
[2:19:33] he says you're beyond it. Then
[2:19:37] time to break through a little bit.
[2:19:40] Caleb broke through and Joshua broke
[2:19:43] through. Men of and women of the
[2:19:46] scriptures HAVE BROKE THROUGH. THIS HATE
[2:19:49] HAS BROKE THROUGH. WHY? BECAUSE WE'VE
[2:19:52] BEEN GIVEN A MESSAGE.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; IT'S OUR TIME.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; AN OVERCOMING LIFE. LIBERTY IS YOURS.
[2:19:59] JOY IS YOURS.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; I know you got a camp coming up.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; I know you got some meetings coming up.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; I say, why sit here till you die?
[2:20:17] Get up right now. Don't start then.
[2:20:20] Don't start then. Don't start at the
[2:20:21] next meeting. God saying, "Hey, lift up
[2:20:23] right now." REVIVAL CAN START RIGHT NOW.
[2:20:26] HOLY SPIRIT CAN DROP RIGHT NOW AND YOU
[2:20:28] CAN THEN CONTINUE.
[2:20:30] CONTINUE CUZ HE'S UNLIMITED.
[2:20:35] DON'T LIMIT HIM TO NEXT MEETING. DON'T
[2:20:37] LIMIT HIM TO NEXT CAMP. HE'S HERE THIS
[2:20:39] MORNING. THIS VERY MORNING. THE STARTS
[2:20:44] NOW. JUST GET UP. GO.
[2:20:48] CLAIM THE WORD.
[2:20:51] HALLELUJAH.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; Man wants to tap into potential.
[2:21:02] They try to find
[2:21:06] where they can mine
[2:21:08] what's been hidden.
[2:21:11] A potential
[2:21:13] is a latent quality
[2:21:17] that can be developed
[2:21:21] and lead to future success.
[2:21:27] So that latent quality,
[2:21:30] it's something that's sitting dormant.
[2:21:35] It's hidden
[2:21:38] until circumstances
[2:21:41] are suitable
[2:21:44] for development.
[2:21:47] It's just kind of like that little seed
[2:21:49] that sits there
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; and it lays dormant in the soil.
[2:21:57] And God
[2:22:00] wanted to show
[2:22:02] there's more inside these vessels.
[2:22:06] There's potential in these vessels.
[2:22:09] And man is is TRYING TO FIND IT.
[2:22:12] MAN'S TRYING TO FIND THE limitless
[2:22:13] aspect of humanity.
[2:22:16] IT WANTS IMMORTALITY SO BAD.
[2:22:20] AND GOD THROUGH the scripture,
[2:22:23] he he he'd have a little seed there
[2:22:26] and it would show in the Old Testament,
[2:22:30] a little shadow.
[2:22:32] And in Samson,
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; Samson would break through WITH THE
[2:22:36] STRENGTH.
[2:22:38] START TEARING WITH A JAW.
[2:22:44] This is beyond the limits of a human.
[2:22:48] Something's different there.
[2:22:51] Or they'd come before Solomon. They come
[2:22:54] before Solomon.
[2:22:56] They bring their problem. Hey, Solomon,
[2:22:59] this is my situation.
[2:23:03] those two little mothers fighting over a
[2:23:06] baby. Solomon says, "Give me a sword.
[2:23:09] Give me a sword.
[2:23:13] We'll divide it."
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:23:18] Here's the true mother.
[2:23:23] Everybody in the throne room will
[2:23:24] receive.
[2:23:26] Where'd this WISDOM COME FROM?
[2:23:29] THIS IS beyond man.
[2:23:33] Something's different here.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; Daniel showed the dreams of
[2:23:39] Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:23:42] Oh, the wise men were going to get
[2:23:43] killed. And he comes and says, "Your
[2:23:46] dream has been revealed to me. This is
[2:23:47] what it is."
[2:23:50] Who is this? How can a MAN DO THIS?
[2:23:55] AND GOD WAS SHOWING just little by
[2:23:56] little in the Old Testament.
[2:24:00] There's a resource.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; But something changed
[2:24:10] when a seed
[2:24:12] was placed
[2:24:13] in the womb of a virgin.
[2:24:20] And a little lady caught THE WORD OF
[2:24:22] HER.
[2:24:24] AND IT PROCEEDED TO PRODUCE
[2:24:28] something a little different.
[2:24:32] And out came what man looked AT
[2:24:36] was just a man.
[2:24:39] He got tired.
[2:24:43] He cried.
[2:24:45] He wept.
[2:24:47] He got hungry.
[2:24:52] He had sorrow.
[2:24:56] He laughed.
[2:24:58] He had joy
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; just like you.
[2:25:05] And nobody took no mind
[2:25:09] when he stepped into a little wedding
[2:25:10] ceremony one day.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus is here. That's nice. It's
[2:25:16] good to see him again.
[2:25:18] Wonder how he's been.
[2:25:20] Last last last I saw him, he was having
[2:25:22] a real tough time. One of his one of his
[2:25:25] friends had passed away and he was
[2:25:26] really down and low.
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; It's good to see he's out now
[2:25:32] socializing a little bit
[2:25:35] like a kind of his real self again. A
[2:25:37] real man again.
[2:25:40] And no one took notice.
[2:25:43] I stepped to the side,
[2:25:47] prayed over some pots of water,
[2:25:52] stepped away.
[2:25:58] Something was different now.
[2:26:02] WAIT A SECOND.
[2:26:04] WAIT A SECOND.
[2:26:06] SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN CONCEALED FOR A
[2:26:08] LITTLE WHILE WAS NOW COMING TO
[2:26:11] MANIFESTATION.
[2:26:13] WHAT WAS HAPPENING WAS A HIDDEN QUALITY
[2:26:17] THAT GOD SHOWED IN TYPE WAS NOW COMING
[2:26:20] TO FULL MANIFESTATION.
[2:26:23] IT WAS ETERNITY
[2:26:25] combining with mortality.
[2:26:28] AND WHEN THAT TRANSPIRED,
[2:26:31] ALL THE LIMITS
[2:26:33] WERE REMOVED.
[2:26:36] NOTHING WAS HOLDING HIM BACK NO MORE.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; THE SPOKEN WORD RESIDING IN FLESH.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T JUST IN PART. IT WASN'T JUST
[2:26:46] STRENGTH IN SAMSON WISDOM IN SOLOMON,
[2:26:50] BUT NOW THE WHOLE THING. ALL THAT GOD
[2:26:54] WAS, HE POURED INTO CHRIST.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; This is limited. This is limited.
[2:27:06] MY SIGHT IS LIMITED.
[2:27:08] I CAN'T see much further than PAST THEM
[2:27:10] TREES.
[2:27:11] MY SMELL,
[2:27:13] it's limited. I CAN'T SMELL BUT RIGHT
[2:27:16] HERE.
[2:27:18] BUT WHEN THAT WHEN THE ETERNAL ONE
[2:27:21] STEPPED INTO FLESH WHEN GOD LIFE DROPPED
[2:27:25] INTO FLESH
[2:27:28] ALL THE LIMITS
[2:27:32] took over all the natural limits.
[2:27:38] Oh, that's what the woman at the well
[2:27:39] experienced.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm thirsty. Can you get me a drink?
[2:27:45] Well, you know, you take your own. you
[2:27:47] know, get your drink. You know,
[2:27:50] you know, she was a thirsty woman. God
[2:27:52] knew what she needed. He said, "If I
[2:27:54] give you water, if I took a drink from
[2:27:57] me, you'll never thirst again." Wait a
[2:28:00] second. What man can say? Who can give
[2:28:02] you a drink AND NEVER THIRST AGAIN?
[2:28:04] WE'RE HUMANS. AND WE WILL BE ON THREE
[2:28:06] DAYS WITHOUT WATER. WE'RE IN BIG
[2:28:08] TROUBLE.
[2:28:10] But if YOU GIVE ME WATER, YOU MEAN I'LL
[2:28:13] NEVER THIRST AGAIN? THAT'S BECAUSE I'M
[2:28:15] FROM ANOTHER KINGDOM. I CAME FROM
[2:28:18] ETERNITY. I CAME FROM THE ETERNAL REALMS
[2:28:20] OF GLORY. AND IF YOU RECEIVE OF ME THIS
[2:28:23] MORNING,
[2:28:25] RIVERS OF LIVING WATER
[2:28:27] WILL POUR OUT OF YOU
[2:28:30] CUZ IT'S NOT JUST MY LIFE AND ME.
[2:28:33] GOD WAS NOT CONTAINING IT JUST FOR HIM.
[2:28:36] DRINK.
[2:28:38] DRINK OF THIS RESOURCE
[2:28:41] AND YOU WILL RECEIVE OF THE UNTAPPED
[2:28:44] GOODNESS OF GOD.
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; one by one
[2:29:00] person after person
[2:29:03] started to realize
[2:29:05] there's more to this man?
[2:29:08] then meets the eye.
[2:29:11] This is not just a HUMAN BEING.
[2:29:15] HOW can this happen?
[2:29:17] And that's with a little woman who had a
[2:29:20] blood issue. She realized
[2:29:24] there's more there. There's resources
[2:29:27] there that I NEED TO TAP INTO. I'VE GONE
[2:29:31] TO DOCTORS.
[2:29:33] I've gone to everyone that COULD TRY AND
[2:29:34] HELP. I've asked them. I'VE PAID THEM.
[2:29:38] I'VE GIVEN THEM EVERYTHING I GOT. AFTER
[2:29:40] 9 OR 12 YEARS, YEAR AFTER YEAR,
[2:29:44] THEY'RE TAPPED OUT.
[2:29:46] THEY'VE GOT LIMITS.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; AND I'VE EXPERIENCED their limit.
[2:29:53] But this one,
[2:29:55] from what I'VE BEEN HEARING,
[2:29:58] HE SEEMS like he DON'T HAVE A LIMIT. I
[2:30:00] HEARD HE SPOKE TO A WOMAN AT THE WELL. I
[2:30:03] HEARD HE SPOKE TO A ZAKIUS.
[2:30:06] I HEARD HE SPOKE TO THE LEPERS.
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; I HEARD HE SPOKE TO THE BLIND MAN. I
[2:30:10] HEARD THAT HE'S A GOD THAT IS UNLIMITED.
[2:30:15] OH GOD, THAT I MAY GET THERE. WHAT DO I
[2:30:18] GOT TO DO? I GOT TO DO SOMETHING. I GOT
[2:30:22] TO GET TO HIS GARMENT. WHAT CAN I DO?
[2:30:25] BREAKTHROUGH. WHAT CAN I DO? GET UP.
[2:30:30] YES, YOU DIE.
[2:30:32] SO SHE RAN THROUGH. THROUGH. I NEED TO
[2:30:35] TOUCH HIS GARMENT. OH,
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; SHE DID WHATEVER IT TOOK
[2:30:42] JUST FOR A TOUCH OF THE UNLIMITED ONE.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; I say to YOU THIS MORNING,
[2:30:56] the unlimited one is here.
[2:31:01] I don't preach this.
[2:31:03] I don't preach this to say that you
[2:31:06] can't reach him.
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; I don't preach this this morning so that
[2:31:11] you can't reach him.
[2:31:14] I preach this this morning to let you
[2:31:16] know he's here.
[2:31:21] REACH OUT AND TOUCH HIM.
[2:31:28] You say, "Better Michael."
[2:31:30] It just seemed so easy for her cuz she
[2:31:34] could feel it.
[2:31:38] She could see it.
[2:31:43] Blessed are your eyes that don't see
[2:31:44] them,
[2:31:46] but yet believe
[2:31:50] that your faith
[2:31:52] reaches and touches him.
[2:31:59] Sometime that even feels difficult for
[2:32:01] me.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; Cuz my need is so great.
[2:32:06] Do you know how many times Butter Brown
[2:32:08] says
[2:32:10] you didn't know
[2:32:13] you had that much faith?
[2:32:21] He's just discerning the need, the Holy
[2:32:22] Spirit.
[2:32:24] They're sitting there right on a chair
[2:32:25] in the audience.
[2:32:27] He said, "You're healed. You didn't know
[2:32:30] you had that."
[2:32:35] DON'T YOU STRIVE AND STRUGGLE. JUST
[2:32:38] BELIEVE. LET HIM DROP IN THE FAITH. IT'S
[2:32:41] A REVELATION. IT COMES FROM HEAVEN
[2:32:43] ABOVE.
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; I'm watching my clock.
[2:32:53] I think I've been one hour.
[2:32:56] You just let me come down to
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; I know it's been a big day for you.
[2:33:05] But there was a duel one day.
[2:33:11] I love this moment in time.
[2:33:14] I think God must have been waiting for
[2:33:16] this moment.
[2:33:19] Jesus knew was coming
[2:33:21] and he walked he came across the water
[2:33:26] to the land of the Genan.
[2:33:29] And there was a man that they named
[2:33:30] Legion
[2:33:34] and by all man's thoughts
[2:33:38] this man was bound by demon upon demon.
[2:33:46] If I could say Legion was named such
[2:33:51] trying to convey,
[2:33:54] HE WAS SO FILLED WITH SO MUCH DARKNESS
[2:33:56] AND TORMENT
[2:34:00] almost if you could say he was filled
[2:34:02] with a seemingly unlimited amount of
[2:34:05] demonic power.
[2:34:12] Seemingly
[2:34:17] seemingly
[2:34:22] in God
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; seemingly
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; seemingly.
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; It looks LIKE
[2:34:30] it was this pinnacle,
[2:34:33] &gt;&gt; the peak
[2:34:35] of Satan's unlimited power.
[2:34:42] Seemingly
[2:34:47] Satan,
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; he said, "Let's watch this."
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; OH, Satan was proud.
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; This is my champion.
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; No one.
[2:35:04] HE TEARS CHAINS,
[2:35:06] WREAKS HAVOC, PUTS FEAR, BROKEN HOMES,
[2:35:13] let's watch this one play,
[2:35:16] and a duel.
[2:35:21] A duel
[2:35:22] was about to happen.
[2:35:25] SATAN'S CHAMPION
[2:35:29] and the UNLIMITED WAR.
[2:35:32] COME ON.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; I WOULD WANT TO SAY IT THIS WAY.
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; THE limited edition.
[2:35:40] Limited edition
[2:35:43] EDITION
[2:35:46] versus the unlimited edition.
[2:35:57] CAN YOU IMAGINE
[2:35:59] THE SHOCK? The shock
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; when all God DID
[2:36:10] was just talk to him very quietly,
[2:36:15] you're loosed,
[2:36:18] loose him
[2:36:20] into the swine.
[2:36:24] Because scripture says by the finger of
[2:36:26] God
[2:36:31] GOD DIDN'T HAVE TO COME ON.
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; He didn't HAVE TO DO THAT. BY THE FINGER
[2:36:40] OF GOD
[2:36:41] BECAUSE SATAN'S GREATEST
[2:36:44] IS DEFEATED BY THE FINGER OF ALMIGHTY
[2:36:47] GOD
[2:36:49] TO PROVE to you, HALLELUJAH.
[2:37:01] TO PROVE TO YOU.
[2:37:03] GOD DOESN'T HAVE TO GO IN THERE
[2:37:05] SWINGING,
[2:37:07] &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S UNLIMITED.
[2:37:09] &gt;&gt; AND THEREFORE,
[2:37:12] loose him
[2:37:16] and the chains
[2:37:21] broke free.
[2:37:25] In earth,
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; it became to get very loud and joyous
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; as Legion was rejoicing.
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; Legion was rejoicing.
[2:37:36] &gt;&gt; In hell,
[2:37:38] it was very quiet.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; Reach out in faith this morning.
[2:37:54] and put hell
[2:37:56] &gt;&gt; into silence.
[2:38:09] Shock Satan by your faith this morning.
[2:38:21] What was God doing through all these
[2:38:22] moments of scripture?
[2:38:27] HE WAS SHOWING
[2:38:29] that when the ETERNAL GOD
[2:38:33] steps into flesh,
[2:38:35] the limits
[2:38:37] of MORTALITY
[2:38:40] are removed.
[2:38:43] Hallelujah.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:38:45] But it did not stay there.
[2:38:49] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that's why the temple veil
[2:38:51] was rented.
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; The barrier of entry.
[2:38:59] Man desiring LIMITLESS
[2:39:03] AND they're looking at IN A CARNAL
[2:39:04] REALM. AND GOD TEARS THE VEIL,
[2:39:08] TEARS THE VEIL
[2:39:10] AND ISSUES OUT HIS LIFE.
[2:39:14] AND THE BARRIER OF ENTRY
[2:39:16] INTO AN UNLIMITED LIFE OF CHRIST
[2:39:20] WAS REMOVED.
[2:39:23] HALLELUJAH.
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; It was where the high priest could only
[2:39:28] walk in.
[2:39:32] Oh, if I could only go in there,
[2:39:36] experience the shikina presence.
[2:39:42] but only the high priest.
[2:39:47] I'm not even of the Levitical
[2:39:48] priesthood.
[2:39:53] I'll never get a chance
[2:39:56] to experience the beauty
[2:39:59] of his presence.
[2:40:02] And God said, "No,
[2:40:04] I'm going to change
[2:40:08] because I desire fellowship with you.
[2:40:12] Do I desire fellowship with you?
[2:40:15] I'm going to tear the veil
[2:40:18] SO THAT YOU TOO
[2:40:20] &gt;&gt; CAN COME in to my presence.
[2:40:25] IT'S OVER.
[2:40:26] &gt;&gt; NO LONGER IS IT JUST A HIGH PRIEST, BUT
[2:40:29] YOU HAVE BEEN MADE KINGS AND PRIESTS
[2:40:31] UNDER GOD. COME INTO MY PRESENCE.
[2:40:34] PARTAKE OF THE MANA
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU MAY BECOME
[2:40:40] UNLIMITED.
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I
[2:40:51] having to pass some really good things
[2:40:54] here.
[2:40:56] I'm going to give you homework
[2:40:59] because you have a you have time maybe.
[2:41:04] But in your scripture,
[2:41:06] there's a man named Manasseh.
[2:41:09] No, somebody needs this.
[2:41:12] There's a man named Manasseh. He was the
[2:41:14] worst king. If you want to read the
[2:41:17] scripture about him, I want you to go
[2:41:19] home. I want you to read about him in
[2:41:21] Kings. You just search up Manasseh.
[2:41:25] And then he's also in Chronicles.
[2:41:28] 2 Kings 21.
[2:41:30] &gt;&gt; I want you to write that down. You go
[2:41:32] home and read about it.
[2:41:33] He was the WORST OF THE WORST.
[2:41:36] HE HE SACRIFICED CHILDREN.
[2:41:39] HE RAISED up altars in THE TEMPLE OF
[2:41:41] GOD.
[2:41:42] HE WORSHIPED BAAL.
[2:41:44] HE INFLUENCED Israel to sin.
[2:41:47] He was the worst of the worst.
[2:41:50] He sent innocent blood, shed innocent
[2:41:53] BLOOD
[2:41:56] till he filled Jerusalem from ONE END TO
[2:42:00] ANOTHER.
[2:42:06] IF I LOOKED AT THAT man
[2:42:09] say you are a evil
[2:42:13] wicked
[2:42:16] prophets came forth said I'm going to
[2:42:19] bring evil God was going to bring evil
[2:42:20] upon Jerusalem
[2:42:23] and who so heareth of it
[2:42:26] both his ears
[2:42:28] shall tingle
[2:42:31] GOD WAS SO UPSET WITH what Manasseh did.
[2:42:35] He said, "I'M BRINGING JUDGMENT THAT
[2:42:38] WHEN YOU HEAR OF MY JUDGMENT, YOUR EARS
[2:42:41] WILL TINGLE."
[2:42:44] God was choked.
[2:42:52] And you'd say, "There's
[2:42:55] no way
[2:42:57] that that man
[2:43:00] could ever be forgiven.
[2:43:04] &gt;&gt; But if you didn't read past 2 Kings,
[2:43:09] &gt;&gt; you might think that.
[2:43:11] BUT IN 2 CHRONICLES
[2:43:13] 33,
[2:43:15] it says, "Wherefore the Lord
[2:43:18] brought upon them captains of hosts,
[2:43:21] and he brought them and cap captured
[2:43:23] them to Babylon.
[2:43:24] And when Manasseh WAS IN AFFLICTION,
[2:43:28] BESOUGHT THE LORD HIS GOD
[2:43:35] and he humbled himself
[2:43:38] greatly before the God of his fathers.
[2:43:41] And then Manasseh knew the Lord, HE WAS
[2:43:46] GOD.
[2:43:47] AND HE WENT BACK AND BUILT A WALL AROUND
[2:43:52] THE CITY OF DAVID AND STRENGTHENED THE
[2:43:54] WALLS, FORTIFIED THE CITY.
[2:43:58] IF OUR GOD
[2:44:00] IS ABLE TO SAVE A MANASSEH,
[2:44:03] DO YOU THINK HE'S ABLE TO SAVE YOU
[2:44:06] OR YOUR LOST LOVED ONE?
[2:44:10] Because my God
[2:44:12] is limitless.
[2:44:21] &gt;&gt; And he sees a potential in you.
[2:44:26] God didn't go through all this time and
[2:44:27] going go to Calvary just to stop there.
[2:44:33] He says there's potential.
[2:44:37] But Abraham says,
[2:44:40] he says that same word living in you
[2:44:42] will produce the same thing that it did
[2:44:46] when it was made flesh.
[2:44:54] You mean the same thing?
[2:44:58] Ask anything
[2:45:00] in my name
[2:45:02] believing.
[2:45:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. The same thing
[2:45:08] because your flesh halted.
[2:45:14] Why was God so focused in this hour?
[2:45:18] focus on a union,
[2:45:22] an invisible union
[2:45:25] of the bride
[2:45:28] because God is wanting to bring life
[2:45:30] that's IN HIM
[2:45:33] PASS his seat
[2:45:35] into a virgin womb.
[2:45:41] It has to be the right one, the right
[2:45:43] man and the right woman.
[2:45:48] There's there's potentials inside a man
[2:45:50] and a woman.
[2:45:53] Bring the wrong ones together.
[2:45:57] You bring chaos,
[2:46:00] but bring the right ones together.
[2:46:03] God's ordained ones together
[2:46:06] brings beauty.
[2:46:08] And that's why GOD IS DESIRING HIM AND
[2:46:11] HIS BRIDE. NOT HIM AND A HYBRID BRIDE,
[2:46:15] NOT HIM AND A CONTAMINATED BRIDE, but
[2:46:18] him and a pure bride.
[2:46:21] That his word,
[2:46:24] he brother Brandham said,
[2:46:27] "God has never changed
[2:46:30] just the same today as he was then.
[2:46:34] He's determined to do something.
[2:46:37] He'll do it. And nothing is GOING TO
[2:46:40] STOP YOU.
[2:46:42] HE'S PUT A gene in you, SAINTS.
[2:46:45] YOU MIGHT NOT SEE IT. YOU MIGHT NOT FEEL
[2:46:48] IT. YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN HEAR IT. BUT
[2:46:51] THERE'S A RESOURCE WITHIN YOU.
[2:46:54] THE acorn doesn't know it.
[2:46:57] The acorn,
[2:47:01] do you think the acorn knows what lies
[2:47:03] inside of them?
[2:47:05] A peanut, a seed, a nut.
[2:47:18] Yeah. What's a seed here? What's a seed?
[2:47:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:47:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:47:26] You don't think that seed is like, "Hey,
[2:47:29] &gt;&gt; do you know what lies in me?
[2:47:33] I have the largest tree you can ever
[2:47:35] imagine
[2:47:38] right now."
[2:47:41] And the seed beside him
[2:47:45] says, "Yeah, that's real funny.
[2:47:48] Do you see the size you are?
[2:47:51] &gt;&gt; Let me just peel in there and look.
[2:47:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a tree in there. All
[2:47:55] right,
[2:47:57] &gt;&gt; go have another one.
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; No, there is in me.
[2:48:06] I'm a mighty tree.
[2:48:12] &gt;&gt; You're insane.
[2:48:15] &gt;&gt; You lost it.
[2:48:17] You're a holy roller.
[2:48:22] You're a fanatic.
[2:48:26] And then along comes the great sewer.
[2:48:30] You know, they were having this
[2:48:31] conversation.
[2:48:34] He starts to throw the seed
[2:48:38] and his hand goes in and picks up the
[2:48:39] seed
[2:48:41] and he throws it.
[2:48:43] And that seed who was confessing who he
[2:48:45] WAS
[2:48:52] lands in some good ground
[2:48:58] and then down through the ages
[2:49:03] starts to come to a last age
[2:49:07] and the word starts to come
[2:49:11] starts to be ushered pour
[2:49:15] the rain starts to pour.
[2:49:17] The atmosphere starts to pour.
[2:49:20] God starts to cool
[2:49:23] through.
[2:49:25] And what that seed had confessed,
[2:49:30] starts to burst.
[2:49:34] AMEN. THAT'S WHAT WAS HAPPENING DOWN
[2:49:35] THROUGH THE AGES. THAT SEED THAT GOD
[2:49:38] PLACED IN HIS CHURCH HAS BEEN COMING
[2:49:41] FORTH. AND AT THIS HOUR AT THIS TIME THE
[2:49:45] MIGHTY OAK TREE
[2:49:47] OF GOD'S BRIDE IS MANIFESTING IN THIS
[2:49:50] HOUR
[2:49:52] PROVING
[2:49:54] YOU KNOW WHERE THAT other naysayer seed
[2:49:56] IS
[2:49:58] SOMEWHERE CHOKED OFF on the bad ground
[2:50:00] it's in the in THE DUST
[2:50:03] BUT the ones THAT LANDED IN GOOD GROUND
[2:50:06] NOT IN THE thorns
[2:50:08] &gt;&gt; not in the briars
[2:50:10] but in good found
[2:50:14] have grown
[2:50:16] and stretched forth
[2:50:18] its branches.
[2:50:25] These God is God is manifesting
[2:50:29] through resources
[2:50:34] through you.
[2:50:42] Sometimes it takes a deep minor
[2:50:47] &gt;&gt; to find to find
[2:50:50] to find the resources.
[2:50:53] You said, "Well, brother Michael,
[2:50:59] how am I ever going to be?
[2:51:02] You're telling me I'm such some great
[2:51:04] unlimited
[2:51:07] power force of God?
[2:51:11] That's exactly what I'm telling you.
[2:51:14] &gt;&gt; Well, that's just your words, brother
[2:51:15] Michael.
[2:51:19] Okay. You believe the prophet?
[2:51:24] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:51:27] And the prophet said, "And then get him.
[2:51:30] Get him in connection with his maker.
[2:51:36] Get him, GET HER in connection with your
[2:51:40] maker.
[2:51:42] He becomes
[2:51:45] a superman.
[2:51:54] Forget Hollywood.
[2:51:58] FORGET MARVEL STUDIOS.
[2:52:02] YOU YOU
[2:52:05] &gt;&gt; ARE THE SUPERMAN,
[2:52:07] &gt;&gt; THE SUPERWOMAN.
[2:52:09] AND THE WORLD IS MISSING IT.
[2:52:12] &gt;&gt; JUST AS THEY MISSED as he STOOD ON THE
[2:52:14] CROSS,
[2:52:16] THE SUPER
[2:52:19] KING OF GLORY.
[2:52:21] AND THEY SAID, "LOOK at that
[2:52:23] blasphemer."
[2:52:26] &gt;&gt; And they passed by you.
[2:52:29] And you're the super church.
[2:52:34] &gt;&gt; He said it.
[2:52:37] &gt;&gt; The star that was in the hand of God
[2:52:39] said it,
[2:52:43] &gt;&gt; not me.
[2:52:50] You say, "How am I a superman, brother
[2:52:51] Michael?"
[2:52:55] Because you walk out these doors.
[2:52:57] You walk down that street AND EVERY
[2:53:00] FILTHY DEMON TRIES TO THROW its
[2:53:03] wickedness UPON YOU and you bow your
[2:53:06] head AND YOU DENY IT BECAUSE YOU SISTERS
[2:53:11] REJECT THE POWER OF THE enemy that is
[2:53:13] wanting to have you adorn YOURSELF
[2:53:18] WITH FILTHY ATTIRE,
[2:53:21] FILTHY ADORNMENTS.
[2:53:23] THAT'S AN ABOMINATION TO GOD. BUT YOU
[2:53:26] STAND THERE PURE, SPOTLESS. YOU'RE A
[2:53:30] SUPERMAN
[2:53:31] because men, YOU AREN'T COWERING TO THE
[2:53:34] IDEALS OF WEAK MEN.
[2:53:37] YOU'RE A SUPERMAN
[2:53:39] BECAUSE THIS AGE OF WEAK LIVING AND NO
[2:53:42] BACKBONE
[2:53:44] ISN'T upon you.
[2:53:46] Hallelujah.
[2:53:49] &gt;&gt; You sisters,
[2:53:51] you're superwoman
[2:53:53] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU STAND UNDER LEADERSHIP.
[2:53:55] You submit TO HEADSHIP IN THE WORD. YOU
[2:53:58] ARE HELP MEETATS TO YOUR HUSBAND. YOU'RE
[2:54:00] SUPER MEN, YOUNG WOMEN AND YOUNG MEN.
[2:54:03] YOU'RE SUPER BECAUSE YOU WON'T LET
[2:54:05] PERVERSION OF HOLLYWOOD AND MUSIC AND
[2:54:08] ENTERTAINMENT.
[2:54:11] THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SUPER.
[2:54:14] YOU DON'T LET THE ADORANCE OF THE WORLD,
[2:54:16] THE PERVERSION OF THE WORLD.
[2:54:21] IT'S THIS HOUR BREAK FREE.
[2:54:25] OF THE LIMITS.
[2:54:30] &gt;&gt; YOU, you and me have been FUSED
[2:54:38] &gt;&gt; with eternity
[2:54:40] &gt;&gt; with eternity.
[2:54:50] &gt;&gt; So then I wonder this morning,
[2:54:52] musicians, you can come.
[2:55:01] Man is desiring
[2:55:05] for a power.
[2:55:08] And there's a power called fusion.
[2:55:13] &gt;&gt; It's the collision of energy.
[2:55:19] And you'd heard of you'd hear of fision
[2:55:22] which is the atomic bombision
[2:55:26] and it's the breaking apart of an atom.
[2:55:34] It's division.
[2:55:36] It's splitting
[2:55:39] and it creates great damage.
[2:55:46] you know, the atomic bomb,
[2:55:49] but there's a greater energy
[2:55:53] that that man is longing for.
[2:55:57] And it's called fusion
[2:56:00] where it it at the joining of POWER
[2:56:05] at at the collision,
[2:56:08] it creates a near LIMITLESS ENERGY.
[2:56:16] AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT this
[2:56:19] in 1949. Man, man was focused on the
[2:56:24] atomic bomb, the splitting
[2:56:28] to create power.
[2:56:31] But the same process
[2:56:33] that fuels the sun,
[2:56:37] &gt;&gt; the power that generates the energy OF
[2:56:39] THE SUN,
[2:56:42] IS FUSION,
[2:56:44] &gt;&gt; THE COMING TOGETHER,
[2:56:47] A COLLISION OF FORCES.
[2:56:50] AND I THOUGHT IN THIS HOUR
[2:56:52] AT THE END OF THE MESSAGE,
[2:56:55] A WORD WAS COMING FORTH
[2:56:57] TO BRING GOD AND COLLIDE HIM WITH A
[2:57:00] BRIDE TO FUSE
[2:57:04] GROOM AND BRIDE TOGETHER TO CREATE
[2:57:09] UNLIMITED
[2:57:11] POWER.
[2:57:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:57:19] &gt;&gt; OH, man longs for it SO BAD.
[2:57:23] BUT God's fused himself.
[2:57:28] It's uniting time.
[2:57:31] It's joining time.
[2:57:34] It's time to shake gravity.
[2:57:39] A POWER THAT HOLDS,
[2:57:42] A POWER THAT LIMITS YOU TO THIS EARTH.
[2:57:46] BUT A GREATER POWER
[2:57:48] IS PLANTED INSIDE YOU.
[2:57:51] AND AT THAT TIME AT THE SHOUT AND VOICE
[2:57:55] AND TRUMP OF GOD
[2:57:58] THE POWER THAT LIES WITHIN YOU IS GOING
[2:58:01] TO BE LOOSE
[2:58:03] AND YOU WILL HAVE UNLIMITED
[2:58:06] AND YOU WILL SOAR
[2:58:09] AT THE BLINKING OF AN EYE INTO RAPTURE.
[2:58:14] HALLELUJAH.
[2:58:18] That's what I call super.
[2:58:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:58:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:58:30] &gt;&gt; So then I wonder this morning.
[2:58:34] &gt;&gt; Why don't we stand this morning change
[2:58:36] our position?
[2:58:41] I wonder this morning.
[2:58:45] &gt;&gt; You know, I just know the song I speak
[2:58:47] the name of Jesus.
[2:58:51] Just play that quietly, please.
[2:58:56] Speak. I wonder I wonder this morning.
[2:59:01] We can
[2:59:04] we can be so enthused.
[2:59:08] God's word stirs within us.
[2:59:14] But I wonder if you're willing to
[2:59:19] break past a barrier.
[2:59:22] I wonder if you're willing this morning.
[2:59:26] Why sit here
[2:59:30] till I die?
[2:59:33] Why not now?
[2:59:36] Reach into the heavenly office
[2:59:39] and set a wait for next service instead
[2:59:42] of wait for next convention.
[2:59:44] Why wait here
[2:59:47] and sit here when God is saying you can
[2:59:50] have what you desire.
[2:59:56] And next service, next service I have
[2:59:59] more for you.
[3:00:05] Don't settle for next service.
[3:00:09] God's not limited to just NEXT SERVICE.
[3:00:12] HE CAN POUR out now this MORNING AND
[3:00:15] THEN NEXT SERVICE MORE AND THEN THE NEXT
[3:00:18] SERVICE MORE.
[3:00:20] DON'T LIMIT HIM.
[3:00:22] And so brother Brandham says,
[3:00:25] he says, "Now I know
[3:00:27] at the end of the service looking to the
[3:00:29] unseen,"
[3:00:32] he says, "the next row behind the
[3:00:34] woman's
[3:00:36] a man sitting there with trouble
[3:00:39] with his neck."
[3:00:41] He says, "If you believe, sir, God will
[3:00:44] make you well if you believe it."
[3:00:46] He says, "Do you believe it? Raise up
[3:00:49] your hand. I'm a stranger to you.
[3:00:52] But he's not. I may be a stranger to
[3:00:55] you. You may not KNOW ME TOO WELL, BUT
[3:00:58] HE KNOWS YOU. HE KNOWS YOUR NEED. He
[3:01:02] says, "WHEREVER YOU ARE, JUST HAVE FAITH
[3:01:05] IN GOD. CAN YOU PASS BY THAT BARRIER OF
[3:01:09] UNBELIEF NOW?
[3:01:11] CAN YOU CAN YOU LET THE HOLY GHOST COME
[3:01:16] RIGHT NOW AND TAKE OVER?"
[3:01:20] HE SAID IF YOU CAN, IF YOU CAN, IT CAN
[3:01:25] HAPPEN.
[3:01:26] HE SAYS THAT DIABETES WILL LEAVE YOU. GO
[3:01:29] AND REJOICE. GO AND REJOICE. HE SAYS IF
[3:01:32] you believe for that, the anemic that
[3:01:36] anemic CONDITION WILL LEAVE YOU. YOU
[3:01:39] BELIEVE THAT GO AND REJOICE. LET'S
[3:01:42] BELIEVE IT WITH ALL OUR HEART. If you
[3:01:45] believe, GO EAT YOUR SUPPER. THE ALTAR
[3:01:48] THAT YOU HAD IS LEFT YOU.
[3:01:50] IF YOU BELIEVE, YOU WON'T HAVE TO DIE.
[3:01:53] THAT CANCER HAS LEFT YOU. YOU BELIEVE,
[3:01:57] GO AND REJOICE.
[3:01:59] HOW COMPLICATED WAS THAT?
[3:02:02] THAT WASN'T COMPLICATED.
[3:02:04] THE SAME FAITH THAT THEY NEEDED IS RIGHT
[3:02:08] HERE. YOU TOO CAN BELIEVE.
[3:02:13] He says, "Now with one accord, pass
[3:02:17] every barrier.
[3:02:20] believe that God is here
[3:02:23] and the sickness
[3:02:25] and diseases SHALL LEAVE.
[3:02:28] HE says everyone
[3:02:30] you pray in your own way.
[3:02:35] YOU PRAY, IT'S YOUR NEED. IT'S HIS
[3:02:38] GARMENT YOU NEED TO TOUCH. I CAN'T TOUCH
[3:02:41] IT FOR YOU.
[3:02:43] I CAN'T SCREAM IT FOR YOU.
[3:02:45] YOUR FAITH.
[3:02:47] YOU PRAY, YOU BELIEVE.
[3:02:51] Heavenly Father, as we bow our heads
[3:02:53] this morning,
[3:02:55] your prophet said, "Oh Lord God, creator
[3:02:58] of heavens and earth,
[3:03:00] I now bring this to you. This audience
[3:03:03] OF PEOPLE, I CONDEMN THE DEVIL. I CLAIM
[3:03:07] JESUS CHRIST. GOD'S SON IS present in
[3:03:12] the name of the LORD JESUS. LET EVERY
[3:03:14] unclean spirit of doubt, superstition,
[3:03:18] unbelief,
[3:03:19] SIN, DEPART FROM THIS BUILDING, HE SAYS,
[3:03:23] "COME OUT, SATAN. I ADJOUR THEE IN THE
[3:03:26] NAME OF JESUS CHRIST." That's a
[3:03:28] prophet's prayer over you. He said,
[3:03:31] "EACH ONE OF YOU, LAY YOUR HANDS ON ONE
[3:03:33] ANOTHER. PRAY FOR EACH OTHER EVERYWHERE
[3:03:36] IN THE BUILDING. GOD SHALL MAKE YOU
[3:03:41] WELL.
[3:03:57] HALLELUJAH.
[3:04:00] If you believe the unlimited God is
[3:04:01] here,
[3:04:12] You know our needs this morning, Lord.
[3:04:15] &gt;&gt; We're a needy people.
[3:04:18] We have burdens, oh God.
[3:04:22] We have heartaches, Lord.
[3:04:25] We have hurts.
[3:04:28] We have sorrows
[3:04:29] because we're human.
[3:04:32] We have limits in our humanity.
[3:04:36] But there's a God
[3:04:38] in our midst this morning, that can meet
[3:04:41] the sorrow, that can meet the pain, that
[3:04:45] can meet the suffering, that can return
[3:04:47] the joy, that can deliver the loss, that
[3:04:51] can break the chains of the bound. OH
[3:04:54] GOD, SHOW YOUR UNLIMITED POWER THIS
[3:04:56] MORNING.

[3:38:16] can see? How many can see? Brother Mike
[3:38:20] has not been here. He didn't know we've

[3:38:26] He didn't know we're talking about
[3:38:27] taking the promised land
[3:38:32] even on the crossover.
[3:38:34] This is what we're talking about and
[3:38:36] we're talking about walking with God.
[3:38:39] Joshua and Khal believe that they will
[3:38:42] receive their possession.
[3:38:45] This is a season for you to be placed in
[3:38:47] your possession.
[3:38:50] God is doing something among us.
[3:38:54] Amen. Amen. God is raising our faith.
[3:38:58] This is a season to tell US WE ARE MORE
[3:39:00] THAN ABLE.

[3:39:28] and her oil.
[3:39:31] little oil. BUT YOU SEE, SH TO KEEP
[3:39:34] POWERING IN BY FAITH. WHY? BECAUSE GOD

[3:39:40] THE oil was only a little.
[3:39:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. My oil may BE ONLY A LITTLE,
[3:39:47] BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, THE GOD OF ELISHA,
[3:39:50] THE GOD OF ELIJAH IS MY GOD

[3:39:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE SENT A MAN FROM NEW YORK.
[3:40:00] HE CAME AND TOLD US THE SAME THING. NOW
[3:40:03] WE ARE SENT AS A MAN from Canada.
[3:40:07] We didn't see each other's notes.
[3:40:11] GOD KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING WITH US RIGHT
[3:40:13] NOW.
[3:40:15] LET me tell you. Hallelujah. There is a
[3:40:18] big oak tree here
[3:40:22] in each of you. In each of us. Amen. God
[3:40:26] is TRYING TO SHOW IT TO US. TELLING US,
[3:40:29] "OPEN YOUR EYES.

[3:40:37] THIS IS OUR TIME. GOD IS DOING SOMETHING
[3:40:41] in our little congregation."
[3:40:45] And I pray that each of you will move
[3:40:47] when the spirit moves.
[3:40:50] And that little widow
[3:40:52] had to keep powering
[3:40:54] by faith. Amen. But you know what?
[3:40:59] What made the miracle
[3:41:01] is her faith
[3:41:03] in the man of God
[3:41:06] is sending us all these men.
[3:41:09] Do we believe what God is saying?
[3:41:12] I said, do we believe WHAT GOD IS

[3:41:20] &gt;&gt; I'm just excited in my heart.
[3:41:23] really not because I'm excited,
[3:41:26] &gt;&gt; but I I can see God.
[3:41:30] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. We must possess
[3:41:33] the land.
[3:41:35] With God, all things are possible.
[3:41:38] God is not a man to be limited to human
[3:41:40] limitations.
[3:41:44] We have a big vision
[3:41:47] even as a local fellowship here. But I
[3:41:49] tell you what, friends, we are limited.
[3:41:53] But God is not limited
[3:41:56] with human limitations.
[3:42:00] And we just have to keep moving,
[3:42:03] keep walking with God because with God
[3:42:07] there is no limitations.
[3:42:09] He swore by himself. This is what it
[3:42:12] says and I love the title of the sermon.
[3:42:15] He swore by himself and you are here to
[3:42:17] fulfill it too.
[3:42:20] Just walk unconscious of fear.
[3:42:23] Walk unconscious of criticism.
[3:42:26] Walk unconscious unto the world.
[3:42:30] Amen. Walk as as you walk in Christ.
[3:42:34] Walk with him. Not paying any attention
[3:42:38] to the right or to the LEFT HAND.
[3:42:42] Just keep moving on.
[3:42:45] 26.
[3:42:46] We are going to keep MOVING ON BECAUSE
[3:42:49] GOD HAS SPOKEN TO US.
[3:42:52] THIS DAY, WRITE IT SOMEWHERE. THIS DAY,
[3:42:55] GOD HAS SAID THERE IS NO LIMIT WITH GOD.
[3:43:01] THERE IS NO LIMIT WITH GOD.
[3:43:04] I'M TELLING YOU WHAT, I received a new
[3:43:06] revelation right now. Amen. Not because
[3:43:09] it is new, but because it's new to me.
[3:43:12] IT HAS ALREADY BEEN THERE. AMEN.
[3:43:15] UNTAPPED.
[3:43:18] But God, Sister Shalom, has just told me
[3:43:20] today, there is NO LIMIT.
[3:43:24] DON'T ASK FOR TOO LITTLE.
[3:43:26] DON'T LIMIT YOURSELF.
[3:43:29] DON'T LIMIT YOURSELF. THERE IS NO LIMIT
[3:43:31] with God.
[3:43:34] Don't pay attention to any criticism or
[3:43:35] anything. Be unconscious of it.
[3:43:40] Hallelujah. Walk with God.
[3:43:43] Doctor says you're going to die. Walk
[3:43:45] with God.
[3:43:46] Walk with God. Just walk with God.
[3:43:48] THAT'S ALL. THAT'S ALL. FOR GOD has
[3:43:51] promised you. I will never leave you nor
[3:43:54] forsake you. I'll be WITH YOU TO THE END
[3:43:59] OF THE WORLD. And he took an oath by
[3:44:03] that covenant that he give you that he
[3:44:06] would confirm it.
[3:44:09] Just walk with God. And then he says,
[3:44:11] and brother Michael alluded to this, you
[3:44:13] will have your ups and downs.
[3:44:17] Don't worry. Tell your neighbor. Don't
[3:44:20] worry.
[3:44:23] Because this JOURNEY IS SHORT.
[3:44:26] AMEN. THE MOVING WE ARE MOVING IS by the
[3:44:29] revelation of the word and WE ARE THE
[3:44:32] BRIDE THAT CANNOT FALL FOR.
[3:44:34] WHY? BECAUSE WE HAVE a limitless call.
[3:44:38] Don't worry. Come on. Tap your neighbor.
[3:44:40] Tell them don't worry. Don't worry.
[3:44:43] AMEN. AMEN. YOU GOT TO GO THROUGH BRI
[3:44:47] PATCHES AND OVER SHARP ROCKS AND OVER
[3:44:49] BLUFFS AND DOWN THE HILLSIDES UP through
[3:44:51] the mountains
[3:44:58] over waters but walk with God.
[3:45:02] Amen. And now now this quote makes sense
[3:45:08] because we read it on the crossover.
[3:45:11] Now it makes sense.
[3:45:13] Why? Because our God is limitless.
[3:45:20] Now, I don't know about you, but I'm
[3:45:22] taking this personally.
[3:45:25] What has been preached today? It has
[3:45:28] been mine. How many can say it's been
[3:45:30] mine?
[3:45:32] Amen.
[3:45:34] Amen.
[3:45:35] God has no limits.
[3:45:39] Don't be afraid
[3:45:41] to believe God
[3:45:43] for big things.
[3:45:47] Praise God.
[3:45:50] Thank you, brother Michael.
[3:45:52] God bless you.
[3:45:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[3:45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I tell you what, our youth
[3:46:00] camp has begun.
[3:46:08] It has just started today. You know I
[3:46:10] had in you did not know but I had
[3:46:12] invited brother Michael
[3:46:15] this year to come and
[3:46:17] uh be one of the main speakers for our
[3:46:20] youth camp but
[3:46:23] he they had also shadowed brother Tom to
[3:46:25] be here
[3:46:28] and at that time I was also going to
[3:46:30] Canada
[3:46:32] and so there's a lot of changes that
[3:46:34] were made
[3:46:36] to accommodate you know a lot of uh
[3:46:38] programs
[3:46:40] So he unfortunately told me that he
[3:46:42] cannot make it to Uganda being that he's
[3:46:44] going to be here in was it I think
[3:46:46] August or something like that October.
[3:46:49] So they could it could not be in October
[3:46:52] and again in January.
[3:46:54] It was too short time. I mean these
[3:46:57] trips are long haul trips.
[3:47:01] It's really long. I mean when I arrived
[3:47:03] there I told I told brother Michael man
[3:47:05] you live too far away.
[3:47:09] I told him I'm going to begin to take
[3:47:10] your trips whenever you come more
[3:47:12] seriously.
[3:47:16] But uh I've always taken it seriously
[3:47:17] but you know just more seriously and
[3:47:20] because you know the the the time that
[3:47:22] goes in and uh the travel and it's it's
[3:47:24] just awful and
[3:47:26] and and so uh it was not going to be
[3:47:29] possible for them for him to be here.
[3:47:33] Somehow, you know, we um wanted to work
[3:47:36] on the audio translations and project
[3:47:38] and
[3:47:41] and you know, he has a burden for that
[3:47:43] and and the brothers here needed the
[3:47:45] audio
[3:47:47] the
[3:47:49] translated sermons of brother Bham in
[3:47:51] audio
[3:47:57] and you know all these languages
[3:48:00] and so we wanted he he wanted to
[3:48:02] kickstart that
[3:48:04] and so that was big enough to bring him
[3:48:07] back
[3:48:10] and so he now told me you know I'm going
[3:48:12] to have to come back and and you know
[3:48:15] but I've pastor Steven has already asked
[3:48:17] me to preach for for him a youth camp
[3:48:19] and
[3:48:22] so that's how he was able to you know
[3:48:24] come and take the youth camp
[3:48:27] as well as work on this audio
[3:48:29] translation but
[3:48:31] I say nonetheless
[3:48:34] he has been one of our youth camp
[3:48:35] speakers
[3:48:38] because uh I feel like you know just a
[3:48:40] few days away from u
[3:48:43] but I feel like we are already in the g
[3:48:45] for that
[3:48:48] how many are not the same the way you
[3:48:49] came.
[3:48:51] Amen. I'm energized.
[3:48:55] Amen. I'm charged up. I'm charged up and
[3:48:58] you know to do for more for the Lord.
[3:49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we give all the glory to the
[3:49:03] Lord.
[3:49:05] Amen. We have a few uh of our friends
[3:49:08] when I went in the back I noticed you
[3:49:10] know sometimes when you're here you
[3:49:11] can't not see very clearly the people in
[3:49:13] the back.
[3:49:15] I don't know if the received visitors
[3:49:18] today
[3:49:20] but I see a few new faces in our midst.
[3:49:24] Uh so um maybe I'll ask you to stand up
[3:49:27] if you've been here the first time
[3:49:32] so that we can have you greet the
[3:49:33] church.
[3:49:36] Brother, can you take the microphone?

[3:49:39] microphone to them

[3:52:54] but we are we have a deficit of 24
[3:52:56] million shillings
[3:52:59] on our youth camp. So um I know that all
[3:53:03] the uh pledges were given by the youth
[3:53:09] and so the the ones who are not youth
[3:53:13] please also step in and support us
[3:53:17] the parents and all others
[3:53:20] uh whatever offering you give
[3:53:23] it's really going to go to support a
[3:53:26] young person. I tell you friends, I've
[3:53:29] seen a lot of lives transformed
[3:53:33] in these youth camps. I was even telling
[3:53:35] brother Michael this year I felt like
[3:53:38] counseling
[3:53:40] because we have a burden for our land
[3:53:43] land fund
[3:53:45] still pushing that and
[3:53:47] you know I felt like we're doing too
[3:53:48] much
[3:53:51] at the same time and yet we are still a
[3:53:54] young little church.
[3:53:57] So, but uh as I was preparing to cancel
[3:54:00] it,
[3:54:02] I received several testimonies
[3:54:05] from several young people that were
[3:54:06] impacted in the previous youth group.
[3:54:10] And immediately I changed my mind, I
[3:54:13] said, "We're going to do it." But after
[3:54:16] the service today, I've been encouraged.
[3:54:20] This is going to continue, friends.
[3:54:22] Because you see, our God is limitless.
[3:54:25] Because if I look at all the fun fans
[3:54:28] we've been powering in these youth
[3:54:30] camps,
[3:54:32] we don't have them.
[3:54:35] How it has been coming, how we've been
[3:54:36] doing it, it has been God and it will be
[3:54:40] God. But you see, you have to be a
[3:54:42] partner with God.
[3:54:45] Give and it shall be given to you.
[3:54:48] Amen. Because you see this is how God
[3:54:50] operates. This how God works.
[3:54:53] See, so uh we need 24 million shillings.
[3:54:57] I don't want to beg the people in the
[3:55:00] youth camp
[3:55:02] and tell them we have a deficit.
[3:55:04] We are the hosts.
[3:55:06] Let's do it. Let's do it. We have a
[3:55:09] brother Michael from Path
[3:55:12] and I know I don't know maybe we're
[3:55:14] still streaming. I want him to hear
[3:55:16] this. He sent you greetings.
[3:55:19] You know you are namesex.
[3:55:22] you know, actually it's going to be
[3:55:23] flying in when you're flying out.
[3:55:26] We just miss each other by a few hours.
[3:55:30] Brother Michael is a is a wonderful
[3:55:31] brother there
[3:55:33] and um you know is coming from P and
[3:55:35] then brother Joshua from Brisbane
[3:55:39] &gt;&gt; and brother Tasha from Johannesburg
[3:55:43] all these like brother Michael here are
[3:55:45] wonderful men of God
[3:55:49] and uh I was still even telling brother
[3:55:51] Michael why don't you it's just a few
[3:55:53] days why don't you stay
[3:55:56] how many agree with
[3:56:01] So anyways, we will see. But uh uh well,
[3:56:05] it is a hard one, but uh yeah, you you
[3:56:08] just pray and we are trusting to have a
[3:56:11] wonderful time.
[3:56:14] I've been measuring on the baptism of
[3:56:16] the Holy Ghost in these three camps.
[3:56:21] But on this uh fourth camp,
[3:56:24] I'm intending to really um the burden
[3:56:27] that I have is to ground the young
[3:56:30] people
[3:56:32] more in the present truth
[3:56:36] for them to know what is the message all
[3:56:37] about.
[3:56:40] What is this message? So that they too
[3:56:42] can have a burden and a vision to take
[3:56:43] them.
[3:56:46] So you be in prayer. Some people who are
[3:56:48] really really burdened to prayer I know
[3:56:50] they there just be in prayer.
[3:56:52] Uh some have just given up praying even
[3:56:56] please don't give up prayer. Prayer is
[3:56:58] very important. Be in prayer for these
[3:57:02] meetings. Even if it's a bunch of
[3:57:04] sisters or somewhere you know just be in
[3:57:05] prayer. God will bless and honor you as
[3:57:08] well. So we have we're going to have a
[3:57:12] meeting
[3:57:14] after lunch.
[3:57:16] Um, we just give it about um um I I I
[3:57:20] know we are not used to that but u
[3:57:24] I'm going to give you 2 hours
[3:57:28] 4 p.m.
[3:57:30] &gt;&gt; So if you leave far you don't need to go
[3:57:32] far.
[3:57:35] Let's be back here 4 p.m. so that we can
[3:57:39] plan.
[3:57:41] We've not had a lot of meetings this
