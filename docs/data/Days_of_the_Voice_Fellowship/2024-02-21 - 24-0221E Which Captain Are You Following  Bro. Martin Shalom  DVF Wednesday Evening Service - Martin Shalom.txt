Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen yeah I welcome you this evening the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I pray that you pray for me the Lord knows the desires of your heart shall we turn to our Bible and read Numbers Chapter 13 amen vers 30 sistera you welcome from the amen uh and Caleb steal the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we being not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that Eed up the inhabitant thereof and all the people that were that and all the people that we saw in it a man of great stature and Stat and there we saw the giant the sons of anak which came out of against against and we were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and we saw we were in their s for [Music] amen Lord Jesus we thank you for the word we have read father we remember this happened to the first Exodus and God we are in another Exodus Lord and that is the Third Exodus Lord Jesus but you told us you warn us in your word ever happened to them Father it was for our examples Lord Precious Jesus we invite you to come and have the full prence in Christ Jesus we pray amen blessed be the name of the Lord praise the Lord are you finding the Lord amen yeah I trust that uh God willing or not be lengthy this evening uh yeah I will preach like I pray that God give me the grace for one hour and uh my small sharing tonight it's like it's in a form of a question and it says which Captain are you following blessed be the name of the Lord and where we have read in numbers this is the story this is what happened to the children of Israel I want to thank my pastor for the for giving me this opportunity against stand before the I always say it's one of my it's the hardest time always in my life but I am depending on him that God will use me to speak to you if you came expecting he will speak to your blessed be the name of the Lord in this scripture where we have read we are seeing something here in vers 30 we this is our common scripture it has been re-echoed and echoed through the generation amen even here amen but today I will try to take another Direction and Caleb steal the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it remember the Journey of Israel out of Egypt they came out 2 million people because God had given given them a promise God spoke to Abraham and told him that after 400 years he would take them back to the promised land blessed be the name of the Lord and we are seeing you know the the story of Israel how they went to Egypt the prophet say that it was because of jealousy the brothers of Joseph envied him and he was sold in Egypt and when he was there blessed be the name of the Lord amen the Lord blessed uh Joseph and he was prosperous man and but remember in uh remember that before the foundation of the world God knew everything he knew end from the beginning so it was the will of God for Joseph to be sold in Egypt blessed be the name of the Lord it was not a coincidence amen it was just a coincidence for you to bypass your theop but God knew that it would happen blessed be the name of the Lord and out of the two million people who came who came from Egypt going to the promised land the Bible points Two Men and that is Joshua and Cal and calb was a type of a Believer blessed be the name of the Lord because when God met Moses in the burning bush and Moses gave many excuses amen and God also ask him some questions who made the dumb [Applause] the but Moses kept on giving many excuses praise the Lord amen so finally God asked Moses what do you have on your hand but remember if we go way back that how Moses was raised because God had given Abram a promise and that promise had to come to pass no matter regardless of whatever happens when God gives a promise nothing will hinder that promise to come to pass like the Min like uh the minister was telling us the other day brother Muka that when a seed is planted in the right ground even if you don't pour water on that ground provided that it has the right uh uh uh it has the right atmosphere that seed will have to germinate blessed be the name of the Lord in the Bible says the word of God is a seed praise be to God Amen and here we are seeing that in their Journey Moses chose chose 12 Spies out of each tribe to go and spy the land amen and Among Us the 12 there was Joshua and Caleb and when this man go and spy the land they had to bring back the report because God had already given them that land it depends on the perspective you are seeing you are looking at the word of God Amen and here we are seeing uh in verses 30 when this man came back the 10 of them gave their report first according to this verse here the bible say that calb Ste the people something had happened amen until this started recreating asking Moses many questions were there no graves in Egypt that you brought us to die from here praise be to God Amen but the Bible says Cale steal the people before Moses remember when God met Moses he told Moses that Aaron will be a prophet and you will be a God and he said to Moses I speak to him lips to ear but to others I speak to them in dreams blessed be the name of the Lord when Moses met the pillar of fire the pillar fire not remain at the bur you believe that amen but when he met the pillar of fire the pillar of fire incarnated in Moses and mes was no longer Moses but was God in Moses and Moses's word was as good as God's word amen do you know that Moses created flies you know that he created frogs by the spoken word because God the creator of Heaven and Earth was in Moses he was incarnated in Moses praise be to God Amen you've heard the story of the of Lot's wife when Lord disobeyed the word of God because the word the was they were not supposed to look back but because she had hied a lot of wealth while Lord was running she was tempted to look back amen but remember God's word calls for total separation total separation from unbel amen and the other time when we had interview here with with brother Muka and one brother asked a question it was a business question whereby like if you have a business and you also have a plan B and I remember the way he answered it he said that as long as you have a plan B you will easily be driven back now in Christianity when we come to Christ is our plan A to Z Jesus is the only plan a is the Al and the Omega so when we surrender our life to Jesus we don't have other plan B either he saves us or we die either provide for us or we die either he heals us or we die it's the only plan we have blessed be the name of the Lord so because not's wife had a lot she was tempted to look back and it is believe it said and believed that even today when you go to that place you'll find that pillar of [Music] salt because Lot's wife became pill of salt but when Moses met the pillar of fire the pillar of fire entered in Moses amen that's why we must receive the Holy Ghost 31 say but but but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people they are stronger than we this man had forgotten something they had forgotten about God and the 10 spy in their testimony telling the congregation these men they are stronger than us they are stronger than we they had forgotten about that they had God in their we are nothing without God but when we have God greater is he that is in us there a devil in the world we don't about our our strength we don't brag about our muscles but we brag about our God how great our God is blessed be the name of the Lord this why they had the captain leading them and always there are two captain in every battle there some people when the battle is fierce they start to discourage others and they're calling for retweet but remember that song says he has sounded forth the trumpet and will not sound for a retweet amen the trumpet we have heard it was a call for a war and Jesus is our captain and as long as you following this captain Victory is our so they forgot about God and then they said this men they stronger than we and they brought up evil report of the land which they had searched the children of Israel saying the land uh through which we have gone to search it it is a land that eateth up the inhabitant [Applause] thereof how what you see what fear can do fear can make electricity shock you when even the power is off even for three days that's what fear can do and the Bible tells us that a wicked runs even when there is no one chasing because they live under fear being that this men were Wicked because to begin with they never believe the promise of God that's why they fabric geted the message and they say the other land eat even its own people amen the message is very hard young men go slow oh I remember in 70s in 80s we were on fire what happened amen which Captain are you following tonight which witness are you listening to because we are surrounded by the great cloud of witnesses but we are following the right Witnesses those who made it like Abraham who obtained like Moses who made it like Joshua those are our Witnesses we are looking at we are looking at Jesus who is the author and the finisher of our faith that's why the Bible says let us lay aside every way and every that easily be set out blessed be the name of the Lord say and there we saw the giant the sons of [Music] an listen this was the negative testimony from the 10 spies it was a nagging testimony discouraging but remember when these people went to spy Jericho and they met that prostitute who hid them do you still remember her testimony she said that when we had what your God is doing outside there amen our heart melted and when Joshua and C had that testimony amen they picked up courage they knew that God had already given them Jero blessed be the name of the Lord but this man they had other interest they forgot that testimony that's why the Bible says you should not forget the Lord's testimony amen that's how David got courage King SA I was wearing my father's l and a bear came and grabbed one and I killed it another time lion came so as who is this man this uncircum blessed be the name of the Lord and there we saw the great GI the sons of anak which came out against and we were in our own S as a Gras Hopper and so we in their s in verses 14 it says and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night they cried the whole night instead of praying the whole night they cry the whole night says the strongest weapon which God has put in the hand of man is prayer not crying take it to the Lord in prayer if these people had changed and went before God In Prayer that will be something different blessed be the name of the Lord and the children of Israel mured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would do God that we had and Congress said them would God that we had die in the land of Egypt or would God we had died in this wilderness and wherefore have the Lord brought us unto this land to Fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a pray where it not better for us to to return in Egypt now this is the text of my sermon it is in this in vers four and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into Egypt then Moses and Aaron fell on their FES before all the Assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel and Joshua the son of N and Caleb the son of Jep which were of the of of them that searched the land rented their clothes and they speak unto uh and they spake and all the company of children of Israel saying the land which we pass through to search it is exceeding a good land if the Lord Delight in us then will bring us into this land and he will and he will give it to us and a land which floweth with milk and honey only Rebel not ye against the Lord neither fear the people of the land for they are bread for us their defenses is their defense is departed from them and the Lord is with uh the Lord with is with us fear them not you can read uh [Music] S8 praise the Lord that was Joshua speaking and he said something here nine only Rebel not against the Lord Rebellion is worse than witchcraft it's like a of Witchcraft neither fear the people of the land for they are breed for us their defenses is Departed from [Music] them the defense of your enemies have departed from them amen Rebel not against your God for they prayed for us and the Lord Is With Us fear them not but all the congregation are B Stone them with a stone and the glory of of the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel and the Lord said unto Moses how long will these people provoke me and how long will it be here they believe me for all the signs which I have showed amongst them I will Smite them with a pestilence amen amen so God came down God was washing he was looking at their Ming amen the bible say that God is so long suffering that it does not will that anybody should perish so God gave them time to S themselves God will always give you time to S yourself out but when God came out it was time for danger he told Moses now this case is beyond your level blessed be the name of the Lord SE of God these people they said let us make our make ourself a captain who will lead them back into the bondage blessed be the name of the Lord in the generation we are living in we have received the message with a voice behind it this message is saying let my people go ship me amen but there are those who came out with us blessed be the name of the Lord and for them they are not willing to move they're not willing to cross over when this reaches the prop sayses is a Jud was a judgment seat of God was supposed to be judged they could not cross over with unbelief God tried them destroyed their faith blessed be the name of the Lord but only two were approved amen one in a million every million one came out of it blessed be the name of the Lord amen and if you look at in the message lifting him out of History butam talked about one man his name was called amam and jeed that Moses and Moses mother and father the people they were in bondage but they knew the promise because God had G abrah promised that after 400 years he will bring them out of Egypt and will take them to the promised land blessed be the name of the Lord and says this they knew the promise of God and this man would pray every day amen 400 years that uh God okay the 400 yard has reached and he remembered the promise so this man was in prayer and in this message the prophet says but there was one man and woman who seems to have faith in historical God that spoke to Abraham in time of crisis the god that spoke to Abraham in time of Crisis and they believe that they could call on him and he would answer do you believe that God answers prayers the Bible says whoever comes to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of them that seek so this man they remember historical God blessed be the name of the Lord and when we're in the denomination in our Pentecostal denomination in our Catholic denomination we just used to hear about the God of history but it is in this message where the Prophet tells us that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he proved it blessed be the name of the Lord amen when Moses met the pillar of fire the history changed the god of the history the god of Abraham became the god of Moses amen he became the god in Moses blessed be the name of the Lord so these people they had faith in the god of hisory and this man with his wife he says that uh they were praying they were tired of the oppression from their oppress because remember the Bible tells us that when pharaoh died there Pharaoh did not know Moses amen and this man started mistreating the children of Israel blessed be the name of the Lord and here dramatized the amam and jeh story sometime some time ago I was preaching and gave a little illustration of how am would come home at night and say je I'm so tired I'm so tired and fresh lashes on his back for from the task Master's wife and she would sit down patiently perhaps and wash out the places and weep and say oh am isn't there something that can be done would hear him say dear if you have been with me today and seen them beat them young boys trying to pull those Lords but they were heartless they treated them like they were animals and that is our young men of Israel there something that can be done that is what I wonder now to see our young teenager boys that will be the men and women of tomorrow and our team today ha down in their neck ha [Music] down and and bres pulled down over their hips with a pistol St in their side a cigarette in their in the side of the MTH what will it be it is still slavery under the devil isn't there something that can be done blessed be the name of the Lord the prophet is comparing that time and the time we are living in the other time it was physical slavy but today people still under the sh of the devil amen young men with dreadlocks and they in churches they dancing for Jesus they in the choir they're playing music with huge necklaces with Balan throwers amen still under the same the devil slavery and am perhaps one of one of the only one of the nation would climb up a little stair regardless of how tired he [Music] was there each night held call on God of Abraham the one that he had learned that come to Abraham first comes by hearing the word amen and in the hours of distress and surely if he was God in their day he would be God in that day and if he was God in Moses he is called today he just need to be called upon out of History out of the nation blessed be the name of the Lord which Captain are you following tonight are you following the one who encourage you to go back to the [Applause] world but I'm here to introduce to another Captain amen and that is Joshua amen who was leading blessed be the name of the Lord the bible say that Joshua steal the people Joshua was not the one who was going to success Moses he was not the one C was not the one but brother it was Joshua but calb was representing a True Believer blessed be the name of the Lord and even the days we are living in we have the message of the hour Moses left amen and the Holy Ghost is leading the church is the captain leading the church is the one inspiring the church oneing the minister amen whose Captain are which Captain are you following tonight and we have other captain in the message and they saying that we should not preach blessed be the name of the Lord amen this people Moses come they never came from uh from the other side of the enemy blessed be the name of the Lord they were in Moses's and they said we unable praise be to God but there is a Joshua and Cal there is calb who's following Joshua who is encouraging Joshua today amen we are the CBS who are encouraging the Joshua blessed be the name of the Lord we are following the right Captain that's why we are preaching the word tonight praise be to God so je he insisted he persisted blessed be the name of the Lord just imagine the promise that has taken 400 years and there is a man still clinging to it because he had picked a revelation that when God sends his word he wases over his word he knew that God's word forever set in heaven no matter how long it will take blessed be the name of the Lord some of you believed 20 years ago others 30 years ago others 10 years ago but you have not given up God is keeping you going it is because you're following the right C you know that the word of God one of these days Rapture is going to take place amen blessed be the name of the Lord others believed 50 years ago and when they moved like for for 10 years and for five years amen something happened in 1933 blessed be the name of the Lord when they were in their Christian Journey that God Of Heaven came down when the prophet was baptizing River oh blessed be the name of the Lord and the voice spoke Bap was sent for my first coming your message will for the second coming blessed be the name of the Lord oh what an encouragement to me you know what that means that was the same message like the one which Joshua and C had that hey Brethren the land is real amen the land which John the Baptist saw in the vision the Jesus whom he Proclaim that same Jesus send a message in our generation prepare the bre for his second coming blessed be the name of the Lord and today we are standing behind the pulpit and we are echoing the same message God spoke to Joshua after Moses had died he told him Joshua my servant Moses is dead but be of good courage depart not from this word not to the left not to the right amen and today we have the same message 50 years ago there was a man who was Vindicated blessed be the name of the Lord and he left us a message today and we are the joshuas we are are following the Joshua's directive and I'm telling my brethren amen we are on Rapture Express one of these days amen the Rapture is going to take place we are following the right C and we are telling them we are more than able to possess the L the Holy Ghost is ours as long as we in the line the Holy Ghost is yours amen and some years back we tested it and we are saying the holy ghost is real and we are in the land of the Holy Ghost blessed be the name of the Lord so this man knew that God would answer prayer brother sister that God answer prayer let us follow the right Captain amen praise be to God you remember job because he was following the right cap when he went through all those things one morning hallelujah hallelujah the prophet say the Thunder Ro and flashing flashing flashes and the and God told job tell yourself a man and I ask you a question where were you brother sister I'm here to tell you you are not going to fail you are not going to go back the Bible says we are not of them who draws back amen the Jesus we are following he has never started a battle that he cannot finish he the champion of the champion is the great warrior because even in in that Exodus when they reached the worldall of Jero blessed be the name of the Lord that P of fire it puts on another flesh appear as the captain of the of the Lord who was that Captain that was the Lord Jesus himself and the same Captain the same God who gave Moses Moses the message that same God put on flesh and came and proved to Joshua that I am here to lead this battle because he is the right captain the same God who sent the prophet with a message that same pill of fire that same Angel of the Lord here tonight leading the church amen blessed be the name of the Lord and the prophet said that am regardless of how tired he was there night he called on God of Abraham that one that that he had learn that come to Abraham what do you do in your night I on WhatsApp the whole night do you Tik Tok the whole night do you Facebook the whole night do you watch movie the whole night blessed be the name of the Lord not amam and I want to tell you the prophet tells us that when we meet the same quality when use the same procedure that God will appear amen when we spend our nights in prayer reading the word of God studying the word of God the god of Abraham is still the same God today he still speak it still appears even as I'm speaking now the other day one brother was giving us a testimony and he told us bre do you know what today the angel of the Lord visited me oh what a moment blessed be the name of the Lord do you want to be visited by an Angel be in prayer read the word meditate on the word Blessed Be name of the Lord but remember the more they could pray the harder the life became the Propet say but today the people if they don't get everything they ask for the first time they pray they seems to think that

willing to ser speak my [Music] Lord be willing to say speak my Lord and I will quickly answer me I'll be quick to answer if we believe the Bible to be a history it is also a prophetic book that say that Jesus Christ the same God shall rise in the last days and is the time for him to come on sin if this is not that time when is that time for Jesus to come in this is the time for Jesus to come on see it's waiting for men and women who are going to rise and take the challenge amen blessed be the name of the Lord oh Abraham had been given a promise by by this God of History we hadn't answered a prayer in for who had Who had who hadn't answered prayer in 400 years as for as we have record but he made a promise that he would bring them out amen that is what matters did God promise whether he silent for 10 years let us keep believing as long as the promises of God he will bring it to B amen amen don't try to figure out how will your body change just receive the Holy Ghost your body will change by itself that is none of your business receive you the Holy Ghost and see how that body will change because the Bible says when the spirit that raise from the dead dwelleth in us he will Quicken our motor God will bring his promise to pass seemingly we have had silent for God for a long time but the hour has come is going to raise on the sin and one night when when am had prayed for several years his hair was now turning gray and no Deliverance but just getting worse the an the Sheep is beden he said maybe his hair was turning great but amr's anchor he had anchored into the right captain Oh Glory to God the prayer was nothing the great hair could not discourage him because he had a revelation that God who spoke to abrah he can change him blessed be the name of the Lord and one

God and he say that he uh uh he get down business with God he said God you promise and we have looked forward for it and we see the science all here and the time is at hand it is time for you to do something about it don't think that God is not listening to your prayers but he has the right time when that right time comes I don't care how many demons are sent from hell to to like to oppose [Applause] you they are no devil amen amen when time for came Adam was driven out of Eden and the angel was put there with a flam SW but when time for Redemption came oh brother sister no matter how many spirits were oppos Jesus came down from Glory defeated the devil while he was deep deep concentrated praying praying with all of his heart he looked standing in the corner he rubbed his eyes and looked again he rubbed his eyes and looked again guess what Hallelujah there stood an angel with a there stood an angel drone and he said Deliverance is coming and you are going to bring a son in the world is going to be in one the one to deliver them after them whs suffering they increased their work this man never gave up prayer pray team prayer team those who are praying I know all of us we are praying but there are also those who are praying amen let me tell you let us just keep praying DF let us keep pressing on Amen the prophet is telling us this man prayed and he prayed and his hair was getting gray he never gave up because he knew that God had made a promise he was not looking at the Silence of God God had say after 400 years he would bring them out amen the situation you are praying about the word of God is telling you when God's right time has come will give away your Passover is coming amen it will be your Jubilee He say saw the angel standing God always answers prayer if we just hold on that's where the problem is we don't hold on that lady had blood issue given up after trying the hospitals should have said that but God is God who heals this doctor they just treat I have sold everything I had now I'm as good as dead why do I need to waste my time going to Jesus amen but like the prophet said that in's heart there was something boiling amen amen the more the devil increased the pain on him the more that thing kept boiling in his heart and that was the driving force which kept him moving forward amen the same with blood issue there was something in start telling Jes and mention that name Jesus she felt like some Vibe inside electric inside and that was the trying for me tell you brother sister you would have given up long time ago but there is something in your heart is a trying force in you every time you read the word you engage a stronger gear every time you read the message every time listen the message is that you have a gear that's why you're still moving on Moses had led the children of Israel Faithfully into the Wilderness and when he came to the Red Sea the mountain on the side on the side Army of they were trapped in a Little Neck seemed like that even nature would cry out what is going to happen they are finished do you know that Nation listened yes can you prove that by the scripture Jesus said there are gu into the world preach the gospel to Every Creature not only human I have ever prayed for a tree and God it it was over was it was a jack fruit we've ever prayed for a plantation sister told us I have a big Plantation of Cava but the thing is so bitter we went and prayed for the for the CA and that day we had to pull bunch and indeed was okay that is the God we are serving even nature listen to God brother Bram created squid Moses created frogs in the creation story I don't see frogs but we are seeing God telling us Moses speaking frogs please amen that is the part of the spoken words blessed be the name of the Lord so nature cried and said they are finished the devil was bragging around like when Jesus was with the disciple and he told them go and we meet to the other side and the devil thought that he was they were but the prophet tells us when the speak the miracles happen blessed be the name of the Lord amen so the devil thought he had cored them some of them were following the right Captain th says the Lord the was incarn in Moses Moses was God and Aon was the prophet blessed be the name of the Lord so when they reached there there was one among these people oh my good Lord but there was one among these people who are the Flames of God's faith burning in his heart who believe that the historical God could rise on the seene kind of difficulty then Moses stood with his hand up to God then prayed until God of History he prayed until God of r on the SC God of present day and he open up the way and is went through and the waters on the dry land now listen we are talking of the captain which Captain are you following oh it was not long after that until Joshua had led the same group because Joshua followed the right cap Joshua became the right Captain if you the right word you become the right believer and you will have the right faith and you perform the right Miracles amen amen he led them to Jordan it was after the month of April when the whole stream was swelling and the Jordan was five times the size look like any good military leader who would have brought them there different from that uh and it was that very time when there wasn't possibility to cross but Joshua remember there was God of History 40 years ago before the opening of the Red Sea called on that God and that God came down in great power and became the god of present Cris and open the Jordan and crossed them over and I want to tell you that God is here blessed be the name of the Lord amen we are serving the same God We are following the right message the right captain that pill of fire is here to lead the Church of the Living God that's why Jesus said that the case of Hell shall never Prevail he knew what he was talking about they are not demons they are not Powers they
