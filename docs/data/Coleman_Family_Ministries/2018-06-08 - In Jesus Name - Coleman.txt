TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm reading from st. John the 14th chapter verse 16 through to 26 verse and a sixteenth chapter verse 23 through the 31st verse a neuromas 8 26 and 27 I'm reading from Saint John the 14th chapter 16 verse and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while in the world seeth me no more because the world wasn't going to see Jesus Christ in the flesh anymore he was going to ascend up into heaven and take his seat at the right hand of God the seat of power and authority but ye shall see me but we have a promise that we're going to see him in the form of the comforter the Holy Ghost because I live ye shall live also at that day he shall know that I am in my father ye and me and I in you he did hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him Judas saith unto him not Iscariot Lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself into US and other unto the world and jesus answered said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him he that loveth me not keeping not my sayings and the word which he hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you in sixteenth chapter verse 23 and in that day you shall ask me nothing verily verily I say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name he will give it he will give it you a hitter to have you ants nothing my name ask and you shall receive that you join me before these things have I spoken unto you in Proverbs but the time cometh when I shall no more speaking to you in Proverbs but I shall show you plainly of the father at that day you shall ask in my name and I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for you for the father himself love with you because ye have loved me and have believed that I came out from God I came forth from the father and am come into the world again I leave the world and go to the father his disciples said unto Him lo now speaketh now plainly and speakers no proverb now are we sure that thou knowest all things and needeth not that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou Kamath forth from God and Jesus said unto them answer them do you now believe in Romans 8 chapter 26 verse likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself make it intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searches the heart knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God may the Lord a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated we like to take a title on it this tonight in Jesus name what a beautiful name what our all-powerful name what an all-conquering name in the name of Jesus and so now tonight's little thought just a little Bible teaching for the little class that has come out tonight and just something to drop in a horse thought this a couple of hours ago got it together so much is going on I'm trying to get myself ready to go family and I and as you know I'm going to Arizona Saturday and so and coming by here Sunday was brother younger from England and his wife and brother Hank and brother hunt and I sure we should enjoy him one day he stayed over Monday and we had a wonderful time with brother Hank and he's a fine brother and the brother younger the lower lip is hard to give us a message about prayer and we thank the Lord for all things and therefore we realized that it was the Lord speaking for the abundance of the revelation which has come forth to this assembly in particular and it didn't come in so much just coming up on top of us we Harley which is stager from one to another and I been screaming out to you in between that you got to pray you see and otherwise it's just sits there and doesn't go nowhere and in just from the right season I feel myself that the Holy Spirit sent this brother alone and of course him have a net ministry for 20 years that was his message maybe somewhere America wouldn't have preached that if he followed what I mean see and they might want to give a bone or something you know but that was his message so him coming into the message well that's what he knows he doesn't know the bones yet thank God it doesn't and so therefore a simple message on prayer and the Lord used what was in his heart which that's what his message and gave it out to us Sunday night and I think it was right on the button as we would say and so I feel that that's just what is needed a prayer and so then I thought I was just followed up a little bit and come back around and speak about praying in Jesus name with all their power and authority that we have you see rather than letting it lay maybe that something we can do to bring down on the blessings know is this that we like to is according to the will of God and then you got it lined up right see so we don't want to leaving in Lucien's so to speak so therefore tonight I just wanted to talk a little bit about the Holy Spirit I love to talk about the Holy Spirit because when I talk about the Holy Spirit I get blessed and he comes around me stronger and stronger did you ever notice that there we begin to praise Him and talk about him the president God just sweeps down like a dove around you amen and you begin to get caught up into heaven II places Amen all the things of this world begin to leave you and you begin to be getting out of yourself amen then then all the all things look real to you everything that other things the the things that don't mean anything is just just leave you and fade away the Bible becomes real amen then the word just begins to move and jump out at you he said that's right and begin to get blessed in your heart well that's the Holy Spirit that is the comforter that's why he was sent he was to ascend and I think the word comes out of studying somewhere that where comforter has to do it fort you know like a fortress you see it comes out of that word there in the Greek there somewhere and so we know that the comforter is a for to us it guards us you know and keeps the enemy away from us praise God and those of us that have received the the the comforter in the soul well then we're on our way to heaven amen and we have it in our soul and we know that we can receive diseases in our bodies and whatnot the body isn't a Redeem yet but we have a promise of earnest in our souls that is going to be redeemed amen and we on our way to the full adoption and before we come to the full adoption at the resurrection Speirs of Vail drops down over our human spirits and then we sort of get a rap chin faith that we know that we know that we know amen and then we go on into the reservation to the full adoption so the adoption of course is the Holy Spirit I'd say in three pulls a pole for our soul where we in heavenly places and then a prophet of God come along and begin to teach us and restore the word back and then he gives us another pole that's the the pull the the capstone in love coming down where it's the Holy Ghost and we know it and that's what happened to the early church and then that's when not only is your soul quicken your mechanics your body is quick and also that's when you can lay hands upon a sick and a sick recover just like that that's when the Holy Spirit overshadowed Peter and they were even healing Peters shadow there was a shadow of the Holy Spirit so talking about the Holy Spirit tonight not to hold you too long the Holy Spirit had a certain job to do on the earth here and it was that the administration of the Spirit now to the Holy Spirit has been committed the administration of the church until the Lord returns and glory Jesus Christ in the flesh itself the Lord Himself was going to leave us and he couldn't trust anybody else but himself so he went all up into high aim and he is sending all up high and he gave gifts unto men and descended as the Holy Ghost and end of on that the fortieth day when he he himself a present tense corporal body was ascending he told him to wait on him and at the end he went on up and he would descend in the form of the Holy Ghost and he would give gifts unto men now he was the one who was going to give the gifts the Holy Spirit and then they would have to wait before it did anything the only thing that they were allowed to do was to pray and bless his name and thank him for the Holy Ghost for it was just as well as they had at them because he he breathed upon him and said receive ye the Holy Ghost and therefore all they had to do was a thank him and to bless him and praise him for it they didn't have the Holy Ghost they didn't have any doubts in their mind they on one Accord it was 120 agreeing with one Accord as touching one thing that he was going to fill him with the Holy Ghost amen now this was a Courtin to the will of God so how could they lose how could they miss out when they were praying according to the will of God for God Himself stood there and gave out his will that they would wait for the Holy Ghost so as if any two would agree touching any one thing is fine for you know you can be agreed like in a night and his wife was agreed touching one thing also amen but see it but as well as agreed is touching something by the will of God is altogether different now so then that the Holy Spirit has been committed to administration of the church and his oversight extends to the slightest detail in the ordering of God's house if that's why you see the Holy Spirit working down through the pasture associate pastor the elders the deacon the song leader that helps to government right down to the tapes and into the mothers in the nursery that's the Holy Spirit over the whole thing and he's he watches the details now because it's got to be according to the Word of God that's why we don't like to see nobody's loving walking around a neocon a slip slide way for the Holy Spirit is diligent about these things you see to me now and so his uh his oversee he takes the oversight and it extends to the slightest detail in the ordering of God's house and holding all in subjection to the will of the head si and directing all in harmony with God's divine plan and he doesn't speak anything or on his own he will not bring a new revelation on his own is only what he hears amen what he has heard from the head which is Jesus Christ the word you'll only bring the word now so when you have a new revelation that's not here they see I mean they're only what he hears he gives to you see because jesus said he will take of mine the word and show it unto you and then he'll bring it back to your remembrance and show you things that come which is still the word you see like he did in the seven seals that's things to come and he showed us that but that wasn't a word praise the Lord now whether the authority of this one ruling sovereign Holy Ghost listen now be recognized or ignored determines whether the church shall be in Anarchy or a unity you see in other words if you're going to give respect to the Holy Spirit and I recognize the sovereign Holy Spirit in your church and you want to give respect to it then you're going to have a Church of unity but then if you want to feel to your free soul and your group in this message and you don't you and the message between in the word and then if the Word of God is saying the head is saying that he has a apostles and prophets pastors banners and teachers just as an illustration and you would have a group somewhere you said well we don't have to have that because the 7-day jizz all over it and so forth and so on we'll see that's anarchy because he didn't say that that's not in the Word of God that's your owner had thereby to see to me now and the Holy Spirit is there to order these things then if you won't listen to him then you are being lawless you won't take the word of the Lord see and then are instead of having a temple of the Holy Ghost you have a synagogue of lawless ones and in hina world can you be blessed but we thank God that we have Liberty here tonight a man with a spear the Lord is there's Liberty Liberty for what look we have Liberty in New York City for God to speak and act his will this will right here through us which begets loyalty then you become more loyal to him not to me and not to the ministers but to him see and now it doesn't give you a Liberty to for us to act as we will see then that begets lawlessness amen now as you notice in each stage of the seven church age Bank sliding each time of voice was heard from heaven through one of the seven angels saying he did hath an ear let him hear what the who the Spirit the comforter the administrator says unto the church amen each time they slide away a little bit and lawlessness and what anarchy and so forth then a messenger would come on the scene and rebuke it and bring it back but it would be the Holy Spirit through the messenger rebuking the church age amen and bringing it back to what the head who's sitting down at the throne praise God he's the head of all things he's the head stone the color stone the capstone is sitting there and he sent himself the Holy Spirit praise the Lord amen and the Spirit of God would speak he'd a half an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church to the churches see the spirit always calling the people back from false doctrine to listen to the voice of the true counselor the mighty God the everlasting father praise God now the Holy Spirit gave some apostles and passes Evangeline teaches Ephesians 4:11 and in the one event now when Christ descended I mean ascended up into heaven Christ and his corporal body he took his seat in heaven as the head over all things to his church now as he went up the Holy Spirit came down ten days later he went up took his seat at the right hand which is the authority to power then 10 days later he sent down the comforter amen and when the comforter in the other event the Holy Spirit came down to begin the work of building up the body of Christ amen and in between that appeared on what was supposed to anything at all but they went in here and he voted through man-made system Matthias to be to be an apostle now if the head himself had just he had just a point of them Apostles himself how could they appoint a pasta when the Holy Ghost is the Ministry of the church and he has a divine order apostles and prophets pastors vendors and teachers then how can a Pope come along talk about a cardinal you follow me now are these our Pope's and Cardinals and potentates and whatnot that's not in the divine order that's anarchy it's impossible for God to even bless that because not in the original Bible here amen so and the Holy Spirit didn't say it you see so now of course it is the head who directs the construction of the body as being fitly framed together it groweth and into a holy temple in the Lord now back in Joel 38 the thirtieth chapter I'll get it this is what it says here Joel that had been having a wonderful time with his church friends and enemies and so forth and they've been they were because rebuking him and whatnot the long about the 38th chapter God come on the scene hit in a whirlwind amen and then the Lord answered job out the whirlwind and said who is just at darkness counsel by words without knowledge gird up now die Lawrence like a man for I will demand of thee in Amsterdam eat where was I when I laid the foundations of the earth declared thou hath understanding who had laid the measures thereof if thou know'st it or who has stretched the line upon it whereupon or the foundations there are fastened or who laid the cornerstone there o when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy here was God the whirlwind the great I am who who always is Amen who always existed the eternal one ask in Joel where were you praise God he says where was I when I laid the foundations of the earth now job knew over in job 26 the seventh verse here just want to drop this into you here he knew himself that in the sixth verse Hill is naked before him destruction had no covering he stretches out the north over the empty place and hangeth the earth upon nothing so a job knew that the earth was hanging as a ball on nothing just in space and here's God asking him about the weary you at when the foundation the foundations was laid and as I'm persuaded tonight that Joel God knew that Joel when he was back with him even Jobe could see their pyramid itself because brother the prophet of God told her enoch built it so it must have been there when he was there and therefore in but I'm persuaded here that of God and the world was talking about a pyramid as we've been taught the first Bible the stars in the pyramid and in the written Bible amen so therefore here is God I believe before the foundation of the world talking to job here Amen honking about a pyramid and Joel was familiar with it it had four foundation stones and also here it says because it had a cornerstone also cornerstone or a capstone or a headstone now if you notice in the sixth verse foundations is distinct from the cornerstone and it was not until the building was completed by lane of the chief Cornerstone or T or the capstone that the sons of God must have been all around God and glory and when he was building his church back there you follow me now and then when he saw the caps don't cap it the sons of God shouted for joy and the morning stars sang together before the foundation of the world praise God when he saw it and then they saw the great pyramid and we know as according to scripture here the great pyramid is the only form of building that conforms to the symbolic description of the spiritual building over in Ephesians 2 as Paul speaks over there a spoken of in Scripture or which Christ is said to be the chief Cornerstone just to give you the scripture itself now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens of the saints you know the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets and Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone so we see our foundation the apostles and prophets amen and we see our cornerstone and we know it from the teaching of the hour that the foundation back in the Old Testament was Abraham faith amen and Isaac love and Jacob Grace and Joseph perfection and there was a four corner foundation there and up on top of that God built a body of prophets prophetic body that was the body the word is the body amen and then John the Baptist being at the top of the head up there near and he come forth in the didn't they the capstone at that time Jesus Christ come forward to camp off the old testament pyramid as we understand it symbolically of course and then Christ with the foundation of faith in love and grace and faith pour that into his disciples and they took that message of the Holy Ghost or the justification rather sanctification he sent down the Holy Ghost which was the baptism of the Holy Ghost plus the perfection in all in one for a Philly horse with the Holy Ghost and quickened their mechanics into perfection a many headed one shot and but God had to restore it back through four different stages that time it took three stages and that's why he had the funny doctrines today you know there's nobody got the Holy Ghost sanctified see because it was three then but it's four now because he said it was four Amen so it's got to come back out that way see so therefore we see then that there is no chief Cornerstone in any architectural construction but in a building a pyramidal foam and in the shape it is exactly like the building it tops out so a pyramid building come up like is here the capstone got to be flat to fit up on top of it and it has four corners and and also five sides to it see now it is the angles therefore the pyramid must be angled to the capstone that's why I said a building fitly framed together and it's a five-sided building there is no place for it in the building see now they would have any need for a capstone if it's going to be on the top it would just get in the way so therefore there's no place for a capstone or the headstone in the building until the finishing touch is given and therefore the builders rejected it until needed so we a read of christ in psalms 118 about being a rejected want to read it to you psalm 118 22 to stone which the builders refused has become the head stone of the corner and so we see now that Christ is the head stone the stone which to disallowed refuse in Psalms 118 the same as made to hit at a corner and he was a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense to the Jews and the Scriptures first Peter - I'll just skip through to give the scriptures and Romans 9 32 and 33 the capstone of a pyramid until needed would be in a way and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence to the workmen so what Christ in Paul said that we preach Jesus crucified unto the Jews a stumbling-block until the Greeks foolishness and also Raqqa offense in Christ crucified is the rock and to the church he is the foundation and a chief Cornerstone to the Jews at his first coming they stumble over Jesus Christ he was a stumbling stone to Israel his second coming he's going to be the headstone of the corner according to Zechariah 4 he said that the headstone come forth with shoutings grace grace unto the headstone as at his second coming and to the Gentile world powers at the smiting he's a stone cut out without hands and Daniels 2nd chapter xxxiv verse 2 the unbelievers the same Matthew 21 44 he is the crushing stone of judgment and from the Scriptures I believe at the Great Pyramid is symbolic of the spiritual building of which Christ is the chief capstone who then is the head the chief architect and he directs the construction of the body of Jesus Christ it is the heavenly Christ who's sittin in he sitting now as we understand it he's already descending he just send it with a shout with a with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and just I'm gonna get you out on term tonight a minute I didn't want I didn't go into nowhere could have going here and going there there brother I want to get you home and I promised myself no more 9:30 quarter to 10:00 in Tenafly only get you home tonight and the chief architect and he directs the construction of the body and it is the heavenly Christ waiting for the earthly Christ a Holy Spirit now Jesus Christ said that we want to come dis down I'm only directedness to a prayer I'm going away o family now and we need you to pray but I want you to know the power in prayer so when you pray you know what you praying for amen see so now if you can get this in your mind just some one little thing like lanterns just drive it to a point and last face if we got a blessing amen so I'm just I'm doing the same thing at night just keep it simple and drive down one thought with you that's all praise God now the earthly Christ is the holy spirit and he come down on the fiftieth day we understand it now the heavenly Christ is Jesus Christ Himself the corporal buddy he's at the right hand of power he's there waiting for our prayers to come up to stand before the father a man he's waiting see and then the earthly Christ is down here on the earth that's why the prophet of God it doesn't mean anything if you have the Holy Ghost baptism you got to be a seed because false knowing to have the Holy Ghost baptism in their spirit and do all kind of signs wonders and miracles and that's why the world gets full when they say well look at this man's life and whatnot and he's healing the sick and cast out devils and been looking at that man but they never see it at all they never see the real dollar bill they always want to look at the false the D Conniff it but before you can have a confident so I'm talking about the real one tonight amen the real ones praise the Lord and so narrow he came with a temporal mission in the world and his mission was to get out of body which he has fashioned out for himself the one new man the regenerate church gather out a Jew and Gentile are during this dispensation and first Thessalonians 4:17 says the Lord Himself which is the heavenly Christ shall descend from heaven with a shout and the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God so what is it now it is the heavenly Christ right now yes he's been descending since 1963 he's on his way down he's descending waiting and as shout has gone forth Amen see and he's waiting to meet their earthly Christ now Christ is the anointed excuse me in first Corinthians twelve a scripture here 12 12 for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members that one body being many are one body so also is Christ see it is the body of Christ and Christ means anointed amen and there are false Christ's false anointed and their true Christ true anointed messiahs Messiah hips that's truly anointed with the Holy Ghost and they are the Word of God and they have this coveted that they ask any for anything - of the Father according to his will he hears them amen he hears them ever rest tonight in Jesus name he hears it think on it New York City hear you these people here in this city you are the anointed christ word all over 12 million people you are the ones the only ones that's anointed for the hour a menu in tune with the composer wrote the music on the day of Pentecost and the director Peter Amen he come down to direct their music the sheet music from the composer the composer was a Holy Ghost in the Holy Ghost the composer move upon director amen and in the door if they got in the same spirit the composer praise God and he got so inspired he sent it out and 3000 begin to sing the same tune and they were baptized with the Holy Ghost and they're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ we want to get back to that that was anointed and God has anointed body word tonight praise God and this electric is gathered in the spirit by the earthly Christ that's his mission amen go out and get the seeds they elect the ones and flash the light over them and it come to the word and now their name Christ Christ The Anointed word in word is the bunny baptized in his name x2 38 gathered up to be united in glory with Christ ahead of the church himself the savior of the body amen Ephesians 5:23 now this great translation is to be effected by the Holy Spirit who dwells in her and how is it going to be the aroma is 8:11 the comforter who on the day of Pentecost came down to form a body out of flesh will after a rapture return to heaven in the body that he formed on the earth from Peter amen that's the body and that is the heavenly their earthly Christ got the other words heavenly Christ Jesus sent His Spirit to get another body like his body amen and that's the body s going to stand up on her own and even raise the dead praise God Lazarus come forth there's got to be his body and his earthly Christ spirit in that body then that will be you and me had to be him where his body amen praise God the comforter who on the day of Pentecost came down to form a body out of flesh will let the rapture return in that body having fashioned it like unto the body of Jesus Christ then that the comforter his John ARB is almost over you know his whole entire administration is almost finished he's almost ready to give it back to the son turn it over to him but before he can turn it back into the sons hand he went to get a clean body he went to get a body without spot or wrinkle amen he went to get a body praise God like his own body no spark no rank no no blemish coz gotta be as perfect sacrifice a lamb without blemish it's gotta be but how's this going to be done praise God and he's got to present that for the Heavenly Father will not give his son any kind of body it's got to be clean through the Word of God amen his son can't marry her it's got to be clean just like him it's got to be the world so what he does he washes that by by the washing of the water of the word Malachi for he sends a prophet with a message because his his administration son was over with and he's gotta wash the body and the body has been washed by the washing of the water of the word of the hour praise God the king is here now in the world for the kingdom of God is within you please guys right in here then that means that the king of God is is power amen and then when the word this word comes into the kingdom of God in my heart it turns the kingdom of God into power amen and it and then it stirs in the king of God shoots the word back out in power these signs shall follow them that believe amen and it comes out and lives a life then right but the word must come in to stir it up praise the Lord so now the king think on it now Jesus Christ Himself is here in this room he's right here tonight is invisible by the Holy Spirit he said the world sees me no more but he shall see me I will be with you even in you so he's here the world will see him he's hiding in his word in our hearts praise got in the king is here sitting here with us yes Sorrell blessing us don't you feel his presence now coming on as the king he's here tonight send a daily thing did he's here I'm not coming on here tonight amen the spiritual Kingdom is is administered by the Holy Spirit from Pentecost to the rapture now the Holy Ghost super intends this construction he has the blueprints the Holy Ghost and when the Spirit of God picks out a minister pastor here whatever happened he gives him the blueprint he gives him the pattern that was shown in the mouth amen and had ministered he's a good director of the symphony the u2 Symphony the Church of the symphony and if that man got the right blueprint and the right sheet music it'll make the same tune and the Builder will be fitly joined together to fit to the capstone amen and now he does this himself he superintendence the whole thing now we're speaking about over here in st. John the sixteenth chapter want to strike the script you over here speaking about in Jesus name power prayer Jesus said over in st. John the sixteenth chapter you said 24th verse HIPPA - had he asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full do you know what he's saying tonight he's saying HIPPA - you have asked nothing in my name in other words John who was under the law he could only give them the rudiments and so forth you see them in now because Christ the sacrifice hadn't gone and he hadn't gone into his his immediate Oriole or office yet so they couldn't ask in his name you follow me now huh and therefore when they ask them how to pray he he taught him to pray the Lord's Prayer see but it wasn't time to ask in his name yet because it wasn't time for him to go into his mediatorial office yet but all brother and this chapter here he was getting ready to go this was the Lamb praise God this was the king who was getting ready to die for it amen he was getting ready to enter into his mediatorial work where he's gonna stand at the right hand until the last one comes in and he's going to get him amen he knows who they are their names is in the Lamb's Book of Life not one shall be lost praise God so he says here he for to have you asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive it - joy may be full 23rd verse in that day you shall ask me nothing sale where you won't be able to see me no more - answer me personally see barely verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name is something new here now in my name he'll give it to you because the Father loves you because you love me you keep my Commandments the father's got the father I have this assurance the father always hears me because I please him amen praise God now if the one will please the father and can stand before the father in our behalf and knows that the father hears him for every thing that we answer corn to his will and then he's going to put himself in you and me on the whole we go on to miss out on prayer I don't want to stay at home I don't know how we can get out of it brother we have such a peril of such a revelation know who we are glory to God we can ask anything according to the will of God and there is one standing at the right hand who the father always hears praise God I make you feel alright huh had to come they all weak and Miss Lee looking asking digging in slobbing around praise God walk into the throne what boldly gone that you a son and daughter of the Living God amen there's a blood he don't hear you he hears that he speak to the blurb though he seems be a skirt amen he sees through red blood wood since his weight ripped to red is white praise God amen now if it to you this nothing in my name now he was about to enter his meet a Tory office at God's right hand and to send forth the comforter into the midst of his disciples this joyful privilege was about to be accorded to him in Christ was going to have this he was so happy about it Christ was so happy that he was going to die she coming for the joy set before him he despised the shame because he was so happy to he would sit down the right hand of the Father and know his beloved you me amen we're going to have a blessed privilege to ask the Father in his name he couldn't wait to get there so he could be there waiting for you to go to prayer amen can't you just want to get it in prayer now and talk to him oh it's ain't no labor this is a beautiful thing to get down there and talk to him he's waiting he gladly went to his death for you and me all the ones that go into prayer talk to me he's lonely wants to hear from you want you to talk to him he's talking to you now what about talking him in the morning and in noontime pray it's got an evening time talk to him wake up in the morning to feel they talked to him earlier in the morning we are a little more talk to God praise the Lord o blessed be the name of the Lord he's saying in my name my name do you know what he's saying in me so he's telling us when you pray you're praying in my name you're asking in my name you're asking in me it shall be as though Jesus himself his self stood at God's right hand and made it stood himself rather for the intercession we become identified with Christ through the Spirit now sent down you understand and his will is wrought in us within us by the Holy Spirit amen praise God so that to ask what we desire of him catch the words now to ask what we desire of him is to ask what he desires for us let us think now say it again to ask what we desire of him oh Lord I desire the sin so that's what he wants for you but you gotta ask him begin it the very thing that's in your heart he's aching to give it to you from the foundation of the world but you gotta ask him for it and if you ask the corner is will how you gonna lose he'll give you a scorpion amen pray that's what he desires for you he know your maker you know what you need he know the little thing I can get you all that little trial hey he knows but ask him and see and then in the prayer actually brings you close to the Lord it breaks you down see Amen see it is Christ mediator ship with the father see now he's doing that in his military office with the father and the Holy Spirit Holy Spirit mediatorial office within us intercession inner see that gives us this high privilege of praying in Jesus name he's standing there and the Holy Ghost is it he's in us here so we have a privileged in his in his name see and that's why he says that any of all of us who named the name of Christ depart from iniquity how you wanted didn't you know to do his will and don't do it that's iniquity well in our network can you ask anything in his name it's impossible so then he want to give it to you so he tells you through the word his will that's all have something over here I didn't have a chance to write down I got over here the will of God does God change his mind God will give you your desires of your heart our heart now has the word in the heart to seed right excuse me the word in the heart has the perfect will of God my own heart has certain earthly desires natural see now it can be blessed and you can even prosper in these things you see but I would I go to pray I consult the Lord for his will which is in my heart in the word so I'm not worried about the earthly desires in my heart also because there's two in there you know things of this world here that people want and they ask for those things that's not according to his will cuz you don't need those things so therefore he don't give it to you and some he'll even give it to him and bless him in it then ifs I heard from the Lord no you heard from the Lord in you in his permissive will that in his perfect well you're sitting me down so but then that's gonna be a bad for you though okay when you get blessed in those things it's gonna get you puffed up and you're gonna swear that you in God's will and you're not then it's gonna come a day of reckoning you see to me I'm so they're always better to be poor you don't know me now and then answer cording to his will and when he give you somebody knows the coordinate a will of God and he you happy then say praise the Lord say so then if we consult the law for as well he gives me his will but my own desire see wants to do something else then sometimes if you don't catch it see if you're real spiritual you'll know what the will of God is and if you're not see he had to throw up a roadblock sometimes sometime a jackass because like Balaam he said don't go bail him and bail been in bears on Hart he wanted to curse those Jews he didn't like him that was his heart in his heart he was prejudiced and he liked those Jews you finally know Moses them down there those mud dobbers so he himself in his own rot wanted to curse them but God's will was not to curse him so God said don't go but he went anyway and the jack has had to speak to them praise the Lord now we don't the horse but he don't want that he wants you to do his will amen see so here we are now mister Romans 8 27 26 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he has searches the heart knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and that's what the Holy Spirit does according to the will of God so we see clearly that the Ministry of the comforter consists of his effectuating in us that which Christ is accomplishing on the throne what God Jesus Christ rather standing at the father at the throne what he is asking for you there the Holy Spirit is praying it through you here you understand when you go down in their prayer and you can really get into a real prayer and the Holy Spirit takes you over and if you ever get into which is you know very few can make that I don't know but it comes just the groanings out of you and utterings and so forth you need to understand what is the spirit knows what you need he's the administrator over god's church he knows what the pastor needs what the Deacons need the elders everybody there women the men he know every person needs he's the one who prays he's the one who makes intercession amen and then Jesus Christ stands at the right hand and asked the father for them and he said I know the father always hears me and then his spirit is in you praying for what he's asking for up there how you want to miss him I mean how can you miss it praise the Lord see so now Rome 8:27 is asking according to the will of God the Scriptures clearly show the Spirit is doing something in us which Christ in heaven is doing for us the spirits working through us here and Christ is doing something for us there we got it now now the key note of all true prayer is the will of God and that's the only point I'm trying to drive down tonight is the will of God disciples prayer notice even in that prayer before they were asking his name was thy will be done on earth as is in heaven then Jesus when he prayed in the garden he said not my will but thine be done is that right jesus said I know that always hears me ask accordionist will he hear us us now see it is the spirits deepest work in the believer now watch it to attune his mind to the exalted key like the organ is a certain key it's got to be pitched to and the piano see then you got to get in tune with that key we're in it maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and the key is the will of God and in the spirit working through you and your prayers gets you in tune with the word amen and then it begins to Bible prayer in here and while it's working through you see the effectual prayer of the saints of the earth much amen when it's Bible prayers here you understand and then he's up already asking your father for it praise the Lord like Joshua there he needed some sunlight because the demons were closing in on him and he asks and for he even is in his heart spirit knew what he needed amen and down it called me give him some sunlight son stand still he needed some more time to to kill the enemy he had to see where to head sometimes I'll be here and I'll be stuck sometimes and he'd be moving around and he know what I need and he sends a more powerful anointing to drive out some unbelief amen I got a little lamb that needs to be delivered sitting down over here somewhere powerful spirit moving in the back throne awesome room you know and but this one over here needs to be delivered their point the minister spirits will just sweep in and while the Holy Spirit catches everybody with a sweet anointing the world strikes the little one the little one got his little weird and gone phrase the last way it goes you understand what I mean sure so now Saint Matthew 18:19 I'm gonna close out on you now praise the Lord I made it hey men 1819 again I'm saying to you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven now this is wonderful we hear repeated all the time if any two of us can agree touched any one thing we'll have it that's wonderful see now this word is the same word that we get our word symphony from C and it means that if any two shall accord or symfon eyes in what they ask they have the promise of being heard see same like I was peeking out organ see all the notes must be keyed to the standard pitch else harmony is impassible now you know where I'm going there Amen to stand it pitch to stand it for the hour when you're praying you understand so our prayer is not enough that two disciples agree with each with each other notice now it's not enough that I said we're brother to none unless you and I agree on this one thing here because brother song so it needs a certain thing so that's fine but there's got to be a third party in that that's him here's the key note the will of God now if both 29 will agree we agree and both of us agree together to the will of God amen we had the assurance that we're going to hear from heaven because while we agree in here and as his team is in accord with the third party the will of God the Word of God he's already asked it for us in heaven at the right hand of God we can't lose it amen praise God so they must be both this must be in accord with the third the righteous and the holy Lord therefore before in a scriptural sense they can agree in intercession we must be in symphony I mean because in harmony rather with Jesus Christ and I was speaking about the symphony you to Cynthia you to church the composer's Jesus Christ and the director is the ministers and denominations are trying to make a note hit back in the days of Luther trying to strike a note with the congregation some Baptist minister of Presbyterian something there sitting out there dead the music is dead because it's striking a note from way back somewhere and Guardian doing that now so that's not in tune with the compose that the music sheet don't say that amen here's a director in some great big cemetery talking about the days of miracles is past daddy in the sheet music the by of the sheet music says that these signs shall follow them that believe therefore that director better get in tune with the composer he's way off and he got this the symphony the people have playing to to thwart our making all around or all wrong noises uncertain sounds the old praise God if ever get in tune with the composer they'll make a certain sound Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and when they strike Hebrews 13:8 praise God with E they will get in tune with the original composer and have the original power and when two pieces go together praise God you gonna have her a church like it was on the day of Pentecost amen and faith in what God has done in this hour he's got this symphony the New York Philharmonic symphony of Forest Hills amen he's got us in tune with the composer praise God and give us some directors that know what to talking about they know it's the word of the Lord they got the sheet music lay out in front of them and they even got tapes and books to tell them how to what the sheet music is all about if they can't read it right amen all they are do is stay with the sheet music and we got helps everything else to help us a stay there and when it hits the day of miracles is passing no more passes and no more that's it no more that it hits the wrong no better go back and look at the sheet music again praise God hey man isn't he wonderful then we'll see the original compulsive spirit amen and if we can come in Jesus name asking according to the will of God please Connie we have got to hear from the composer for the composer will sin down his spirit and you'll see those two Chinese tickets go together then we'll hear the same music oh don't you want to hear that rushing mighty wind that music that was played on the day of Pentecost there came a sound what a beautiful and awesome sound that must have been a roar coming down through there what a sound a compulsive played any on the day of Pentecost I want to hear the same sound that's why I has a director I'm trying to read the sheet music with eager eyes and make sure I see everything in here I miss one jot or one tittle please got a CD director I want the symphony praise the Lord that's what I'm talking about I don't get mad at you and hoping this near but you're making room notes when you see don't you understand when I'm talking about this it's not according to the sheet music and it's cut to be in the same spirit as a sheet music if the director is there in goddess of indicating that he is directed the right way amen and almost all of the entire symphony summarized make it a read like this over here tap the baton what's on over there amen get into here get tuned up no good man just has to father in Jesus name to explain you or show you what's going on so we can have one beautiful New York Philharmonic symphony over here why brother when we begin to make the music that they made back there they're come from all raised garlic all around Madison Square Garden be nothing on it they want to get in here to hear this music to seem usually at the head on the day of Pentecost and when they make this right set up in Edmonton there do the same thing up there but they don't praise God I come from miles or this farm is driving for miles around here that music up in Edmonton do you know one thing it's going to be because he didn't spoke it brother I'm more inspired tonight I know he's going to do it amen and I know tonight praise God that in Jesus name I know where I'm standing I know the Holy Spirit speaking through me and I'm asking a core until the widow of God and he has taught me that I know tonight that heavenly Christ is sitting at the right hand asking for me amen and his very own spirit is asking through me for when I need he knows what I need and he's asking for me right now and I'm receiving it tonight so when I go into prayer in Jesus name I know who I am praise the Lord I Know Who I am been baptized in his name I've taken on the family name and I'm part of the body of Jesus Christ and then we'll play a beautiful tune the name of it is unity praise God and brother can't nobody play you and like the original church played it because yes sir but we are promised to play it again if we do these things in here code to the sheet music brother we'll play with a double portion yes sir it'll be a partay one thing when we play it it'll be so beautiful so powerful all the rest in heaven will come down to here on earth it'll bring a resurrection brother amen all from Adam all the way up I want to hear this tune cuz they are resting there you win me the plate a tuner unity buy with a director who knows what he's talking about Amen with a symphony who's playing the same certain sound and a composer is sitting back in the Kings box so happy the director is not as florists and the symphony is flawless he stands up bravo Bravo Bravo Bravo amen and all the angels was standing around shouting and getting closer and closer my wonderful Jesus bless it be the name of the Lord isn't it wonderful to know that the father always here with us because we ask according to his will how great is our God shall we stand

the heavenly crisis waiting at the right hand standing there making intercession with the Father Holy Spirit praying through us Oh God our cordon to the standard pitch and the standard pitch in this hour is Malachi 4 we're tuned into Malachi 4 we the father he'll hear us wonderful Jesus want to read something to you Ephesians 6:18 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints and for me that's me that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel you know what I'm asking that for don't you praise the Lord I'm a wife and family we're going to Arizona or it can visit our suppose a working visit and so we sure need your prayers and I believe it this is the time that the Holy Spirit sent the brother long to bring us and awakening us a new desire to prayer I just wanted to put some more coals on the fire tonight so we know what we're talking about when we're praying and who we praying to see and so therefore that was my little thought tonight and I won't be seeing you for three weekends I'd be back I was 17 days but we

of a lamb that right then if we are lambs then the Dove comes down which is the word here's the Dove Holy Spirit in Word form that right and he comes searching out for some lambs and when he finally who humbles themselves but what little spirit they got the meal Christ comes in and mixes with that and makes a cake that makes the offering amen a meal offering then the two little sticks you got left amen and you put that little cake with your poor little spoonful on the fire and God bakes it and receives it if it's just one little spoonful went into that meal he receives it and brother you
