[2:50] of God we praise Him we thank God for
[2:53] that also friends this morning I would
[2:56] like for you to turn with me this
[2:58] morning to the everlasting Word of God
[3:03] the book of Habakkuk the first chapter
[3:06] the fifth verse I want to read and let
[3:10] us remember to pray for sister Lawson
[3:11] and also her daughters they have taken a
[3:13] long ship up to Canada quail on the west
[3:16] coast they are to stay up the in
[3:18] fellowship with the Saints to guard up
[3:19] in Canada let us pray for the health and
[3:21] strength and God will shall protect them
[3:24] while they're gone
[3:29] I'm reading from the fifth verse behold
[3:32] ye among the heathen and regard and
[3:35] wonder Marvis Lee for I will work a
[3:38] freak in your days which ye will not
[3:41] believe though it be told you st. Luke
[3:47] the second chapter at the 41st verse st.
[3:53] Luke the second chapter the 41st verse
[3:56] now his parents were speaking about
[3:59] Jesus Christ went to Jerusalem every
[4:02] year at the Feast of the Passover and
[4:05] when he was twelve years old they went
[4:08] up to Jerusalem after the custom of the
[4:10] feast and when they had fulfilled the
[4:12] days as they returned the child jesus
[4:15] Terry behind in Jerusalem and Joseph and
[4:19] his mother knew not of it but they
[4:21] supposing him to have been in the
[4:23] company went a day's journey just goes
[4:26] to show you that you just can't suppose
[4:28] anything and you got to make sure of all
[4:31] things and they sought him among their
[4:35] kinfolk and acquaintances and when they
[4:39] found him not they turned back again to
[4:42] Jerusalem seeking Him he came to pass
[4:45] that after three days death burial
[4:48] resurrection they found him in the
[4:50] temple sitting in the midst of the
[4:54] doctors both hearing them and asking
[4:56] them questions and all that heard him
[5:00] were astonished at his understanding and
[5:03] answers and when they saw him they were
[5:06] amazed and his mother said unto him son
[5:08] why has thou dealt with us dealt thus
[5:12] with us behold thy father and I sought
[5:15] thee sorrowing he said unto them how is
[5:18] it that she sought me wist ye not that I
[5:21] must be about my father's business and
[5:23] they understood not they understood not
[5:29] the scene which he spake unto them and
[5:32] he went down with them came to Nazareth
[5:35] and was subject unto them but his mother
[5:39] kept all these things in her heart she
[5:42] pondered these things and Jesus while
[5:45] she was a pondering increased in wisdom
[5:48] and stature and in favor with God and
[5:52] man made God a blessing to the reading
[5:54] of his word I can see from the look on
[5:56] some faces that they are understanding
[5:58] this he already it's the Holy Spirit
[6:00] bringing out his word this morning so we
[6:03] see friends here that over here in the
[6:05] book of Ibuka is speaking about a work
[6:08] that Jehovah God says that he will work
[6:11] in our days and he says that it'll be
[6:15] among the heathen and he says though it
[6:17] be told to you some would not believe it
[6:19] and we know that Paul quoted this over
[6:23] in acts 13 41 he said behold you despise
[6:26] us and wonder and perish for I will work
[6:28] a work in your days a work which he
[6:30] shall in no wise believe though a man
[6:33] declare it unto you
[6:35] this was Paul speaking when he was up
[6:37] there with the Jews who refused who
[6:41] denied they only savior the Lord Jesus
[6:43] Christ therefore Paul turned from the
[6:46] Jews for it was God's time to turn to
[6:49] the Gentiles and here he quoted this
[6:51] scripture back here in the book of a
[6:53] book the first chapter the fifth verse
[6:55] here so we see friends that God's Word
[6:57] is true it comes to pants but God has a
[7:01] lot of his word for a specific time and
[7:03] season and then all we have to do is so
[7:06] wait until this time and this season our
[7:09] eyes on the scene then God Himself will
[7:12] manifest his own word and it will need
[7:14] no and no interpretation now we find in
[7:18] friends that the work that he's speaking
[7:20] about here is that he is going to work a
[7:23] work and this work is he
[7:25] active work of Jesus Christ that will be
[7:28] in these human temples this is the work
[7:31] that he said he would call out a people
[7:33] for his name from among the Gentiles he
[7:36] would take out a people for his name and
[7:37] then it taking out these people he will
[7:41] work a work in their hearts and many
[7:44] around them friends and families and and
[7:48] so forth would not understand the work
[7:50] for the word said they will not
[7:52] understand the way they will one the
[7:55] Marvis and if what meaneth this they
[7:57] will permanently heart what meaneth this
[7:59] but however God will go on work in the
[8:02] work and Amon inside of man and he will
[8:05] not understand it so then with this
[8:08] thought in mind we begin to get a little
[8:10] understand that God does a hidden secret
[8:14] work away from the prying eyes of the
[8:17] world in the heart then that thought can
[8:21] be planted embedded in our minds in our
[8:24] hearts then we can begin to understand
[8:26] God without it you'll never understand
[8:29] God so we see friends in with this
[8:31] understanding and with this revelation
[8:35] for this is reveal to your hearts Jesus
[8:38] Christ said that he would have a bride
[8:40] in the end time Jesus Christ said that
[8:44] he was sending Loretta
[8:45] according to America for to call out
[8:48] this bride Jesus Christ the Word of God
[8:51] says that st. Luke's 17:30 then he
[8:54] himself would represent himself in this
[8:57] age through a man as the Word of God for
[9:00] the age Jesus Christ said also that in
[9:03] Revelation 10 7 and his own book of
[9:06] redemption there he said that all the
[9:08] mysteries of God would be revealed
[9:13] gives us a clue that when all the
[9:17] mysteries would be revealed then that
[9:19] time that age would have to be the full
[9:22] word age in a while you read minute then
[9:26] you can begin to understand friends that
[9:28] in 63 we entered an - not knowing - the
[9:33] full word age why because all the
[9:36] mysteries was revealed they then God
[9:39] Himself come down and revealed himself
[9:41] you human skin and hid himself to the
[9:45] word Amen praise His name
[9:48] he said that melikhaya fall and that
[9:50] maybe should I hope so would turn the
[9:54] hearts of the ones that I have
[9:56] predestinated to be turned back to they
[9:58] wouldn't want them obviously anymore for
[10:01] they'll see myself in the Word of God
[10:03] expressed on their with the same size
[10:06] wonders and miracles
[10:08] therefore the bride will have to wonder
[10:11] as they still baptize in the name of the
[10:13] Lord Jesus Christ disease these things
[10:15] still right is he still working they
[10:17] would see it for themselves
[10:20] and we have seen we have heard and we
[10:22] have seen with these RS here and a
[10:25] pillow firewood follow it with signs and
[10:27] wonders Americans why is this for this
[10:30] would be the age when there would be all
[10:32] kinds of places of worship the Baptist
[10:36] place of worship the Pentecostal the
[10:39] Methodists and so forth and so on and
[10:41] other groups but however in this age we
[10:44] find that God has only one place of
[10:47] worship you cannot please God
[10:50] you cannot worship God in spirit and
[10:52] truth other than this one place and that
[10:55] is the Word of God which is Jesus Christ
[10:57] all outside of this are lost they are
[11:02] dead and because many have said that I
[11:05] have Christ over here because of no at
[11:08] once I have it over in northern ones he
[11:11] would prove that he was sent forth his
[11:13] word now care for to bring to nought to
[11:17] bring to nothing to take the wise and
[11:20] their own craftiness bring all these
[11:23] places of worship bring it to nothing
[11:25] and so that the true place of worship is
[11:29] in the same Tabernacle a type of back in
[11:32] the wilderness the tabernacle of witness
[11:33] which was Malachi for in this age a man
[11:36] a tabernacle a temple and then and he
[11:40] would be fair in that temple in that
[11:44] place of worship in that terminal
[11:47] who's seeking God who will turn and seek
[11:51] God and come back to the temple and it
[11:54] will look from their ownselves
[11:56] those who seek God who sought God they'd
[11:59] find God in that tabernacle that
[12:01] Tabitha's Malachi 4
[12:03] it was Malachi 4 now we all understand
[12:06] that but we are all here this morning
[12:09] all of us are wondering pondering Lord
[12:12] what is going on now amen
[12:16] we're trying to figure out what is going
[12:18] on in this hour we know that because
[12:21] Elijah has come we know that God has
[12:23] vindicated Elijah it's here we know that
[12:26] but we want to know what is God doing in
[12:29] this hour at man amen well then this is
[12:33] what my message because this morning is
[12:35] about now we find in better you can
[12:38] worship God outside of Christ the word
[12:41] for the full word came into
[12:43] manifestation in 63 and wants to come on
[12:47] the scene that is his only place of
[12:50] worship they can gather on the mountains
[12:52] they can get up on the hilltops amen
[12:55] they can run to the East the West North
[12:57] itself but they must be in the word to
[13:01] please God amen I don't care where you
[13:03] go ahead but you must be in the Word of
[13:05] God
[13:06] now notice friends how can God bring us
[13:09] how can he bring it to pass he said not
[13:11] by might not by power but by my spirit
[13:14] saith or an amen all right how's it done
[13:18] the word the mechanical word speaks it
[13:21] it must be in here therefore back when
[13:24] God created the earth the word sent let
[13:27] be light to you ain't it that's all then
[13:29] the word had to wait for the snot the
[13:31] power the night but the spirit a meant
[13:34] to create the light there's the word
[13:36] speaker let there be light
[13:39] the Spirit of the Lord moved out and
[13:42] created the light and there was light
[13:45] God has not changed from this system God
[13:49] has said in this hour let there be a
[13:52] bright the word to speak it amos pictus
[13:59] we must wait on the Lord and let the
[14:03] folds of the Spirit of God brood over us
[14:06] and mold us and shape us and create us
[14:09] into the Living Word of God to be
[14:13] expressed in the entire you understand
[14:17] well therefore freeze of you puttering
[14:19] if you're wondering this morning the
[14:22] Holy Spirit God Himself the fullness the
[14:25] anointing because the seven the seven
[14:28] course meal is here because we have a
[14:31] full square meal all the word
[14:35] seven Costa seven seals and because that
[14:38] whole thing is here
[14:39] they caught the fullest himself could be
[14:42] here to create his own work and I like
[14:45] this work in this day though a man
[14:47] declared unto you in oil and you come
[14:50] with signs and wonders and miracles
[14:52] though he declared unto you you will not
[14:55] believe it for the father didn't call
[14:57] you all that the father has given me
[14:59] they will come we don't have to beg and
[15:02] persuade no by this morning comets
[15:04] people can't help but come
[15:10] not into heavenly spaces praise God said
[15:19] let there be a pride okay honey
[15:22] devil said don't be a brain I mean false
[15:25] and oil was around there is gonna be a
[15:27] bird
[15:28] poor Gus take it and the Holy Spirit is
[15:30] doing it now but they can't say it is a
[15:33] secret and they cannot see they cannot
[15:37] discern the spiritual things of God the
[15:40] natural man we're just speaking in
[15:41] tongues or whatever you want to have
[15:42] cannot discern the work that God is
[15:45] doing in the hearts already turn the
[15:49] hearts back to the word and we'll prove
[15:50] it this morning
[15:51] amen praise His name so we find friends
[15:55] that God is going to bring to naught all
[15:57] other places of worship this morning
[16:00] bring them all the north so we see them
[16:03] if we understand this then that as we
[16:05] move through the Pentecostal age when we
[16:07] came in 1963 for God to move he had to
[16:12] move into fullness to bring forth a full
[16:14] word okay did it listen to the statement
[16:16] in then at the opening of the seven
[16:20] seals according to revelation 10 7 the
[16:23] full word all mysteries that's the full
[16:26] word saying is to be born into
[16:28] manifestation and we saw the
[16:31] manifestation through the prophet Elijah
[16:34] then the full word was born name
[16:37] anything and vindicated by the Spirit of
[16:40] God
[16:40] now notice now it will be in full
[16:42] strength manifest in the same wing doing
[16:46] that what it did when it was healing the
[16:47] air other words the full word of God
[16:50] when it walked the earth in a earthly
[16:52] tabernacle Jesus Christ is the coming in
[16:55] his full anointing and walk barrier
[16:57] through melikhaya for another temple
[16:59] another Tabernacle amen
[17:02] but it would be in the secret place in
[17:04] the heart amen and manifest itself and
[17:08] catch away a bread by the manifestation
[17:11] of Jesus Christ and only where the
[17:14] people will know it God Himself will
[17:16] anoint their eyes what I said that they
[17:19] might see it yes no no they understand
[17:21] what is happening the work that is
[17:23] happening in their day and a bright you
[17:25] have understood it you have left your
[17:27] baptism methods and so forth and you
[17:29] have come because God has unknown at
[17:31] your hands to see any in turn amen are
[17:34] you understanding this well then this is
[17:36] the redemptive work of Jesus Christ
[17:39] going on right now in your myths so we
[17:44] find friends that notice now bring the
[17:48] word into your heart and watch it make
[17:51] itself known as it opens up like any
[17:54] other seed once that statement now the
[17:58] seat is in your heart the water the full
[18:00] anointing has come then it opens up the
[18:04] seed and the Sun is here to ripen that
[18:07] seed if it's a word it says it declared
[18:10] that it is the word it believes the word
[18:13] you don't have to beg and persuaded a
[18:15] minute you have to pet it it's not no
[18:17] because a worthy song because of because
[18:20] haha seeds over there amen
[18:22] it just tastes the natural rainfall the
[18:25] natural holy spirit
[18:26] it doesn't need them worked up they
[18:28] don't need no private revelation of a
[18:30] tent somewhere it believes the Word of
[18:32] God amen the seat opens up your faces to
[18:37] seed opens when the Holy Spirit's the
[18:40] word and takes it to your heart you can
[18:42] scream anyway this is Holy Spirit take
[18:45] it to your heart you open up and you see
[18:47] it you understand it God has anointed
[18:48] you I insist and praise God why is it
[18:52] this is the word each the brownies the
[18:55] we teach the Eagle age the Eagle seat
[18:57] and this is going on now this is
[19:00] different from all the rest of the ages
[19:04] altogether different
[19:05] Luther in his time of justification his
[19:09] works testify who he was Wesley his
[19:13] works testified who because who he was
[19:16] the Pentecost is in 1906 their works
[19:19] testifies through speaking in tongues
[19:21] and casting out Devils that was to work
[19:23] in that day but now friends today the
[19:27] sea is a sea turn amen
[19:30] this is green maturing green writing
[19:33] time wine for the seed of God is in your
[19:36] heart
[19:37] and it is producing Christ by itself by
[19:41] the Spirit of God that's why the Prophet
[19:44] came forward and said friends get in
[19:46] Christ a preacher can't save you I
[19:49] cannot save you
[19:51] no man can save you the Prophet knew
[19:54] that all the seeds of God when
[19:56] appreciate last February in 65 that that
[19:58] they would come into a third Pole they
[20:00] would be all confused so he pointed them
[20:02] to Christ
[20:03] the Scriptures also said that those who
[20:05] wouldn't understand when heap into
[20:07] themselves teachers having itching ears
[20:09] for a private revelation somewhere when
[20:11] the word of God will ripen you the Word
[20:13] of God will plant you the Word of God
[20:15] will water you and bring you up and also
[20:18] mature you the way to gotta do it so
[20:20] therefore the work that is going on now
[20:23] the Caesar gone have been sold by the
[20:25] Son of Man himself all over the world
[20:28] through his tapes through his books he
[20:31] put the seed in the heart God is able to
[20:34] raise up those seasoned himself
[20:37] and cannot do it fakes become priests
[20:41] God that man can't do it today
[20:44] he cannot though he tries if he can't do
[20:47] it
[20:47] don't look to man look to Jesus Christ
[20:50] he is the only one amen
[20:52] so we find friends that this age is
[20:56] different now if they work the works of
[20:59] God in 1906 up to 63 by speaking in
[21:03] tells the casting out Devils okay you
[21:05] made me now if they work the works of
[21:08] Wesley by being sanctified and also
[21:10] shaking the spirit if they work the
[21:12] works of Luther just by coming out of
[21:15] the Catholic Church and believing in the
[21:17] Word of God that's all we require
[21:20] well this age is different no longer is
[21:22] speaking in tongues enough this is the
[21:25] full word I just explained it to you
[21:27] therefore we have word Saint John 6:29
[21:31] the people say well how can we work that
[21:34] works in the full word each Lord by
[21:36] believing on him that is sit are you
[21:41] understanding now well then right now in
[21:44] August is seven nineteen sixty-six you
[21:48] want to know what's going on God is
[21:49] working to works as you believe the word
[21:51] Amen this on tape is in the books he's
[21:53] working the works it's a hit work that's
[21:55] all you have to do share and let God
[21:59] work the work in your heart in this
[22:01] state while the others don't understand
[22:03] it while the others wonder about it
[22:04] pioneer no heart God is working the work
[22:07] you are taking on the nature of the Lamb
[22:09] not a go all wolf amen

[27:55] did he notice at the word of God amen
[27:58] nor was the work that he was doing was
[28:01] hid from the wise he was actually

[28:06] bill in the arc but that was here from
[28:09] those are the wise and true amen they

[28:38] time here this is the time when Jesus
[28:40] Christ now I want to type Mary as the
[28:44] shock I'm only typing her for the
[28:45] Prophet typed her as the champ as the
[28:48] shop for she had to seat in her but Mary
[28:50] was saved of course but she represents
[28:52] the Pentecostal church age so therefore
[28:55] she's a type or you instead is now she
[28:58] is saved I'm not saying that she's a
[29:00] chance to be burned up but she's typing
[29:02] out the champ amen praise the Lord
[29:05] now we understand that okay now here
[29:08] were they at a certain season and a
[29:11] certain time they went up to the feast
[29:13] at Jerusalem amen
[29:15] alright now they went up there and they
[29:18] worship and they praise God and they had
[29:20] a wonderful time then it says here in
[29:22] the 43rd verse and when they had
[29:24] fulfilled the days that all that they
[29:25] were supposed to do as they returned the
[29:28] child Jesus tarried be heard in
[29:31] Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother knew
[29:33] not of it but they supposed him to have
[29:36] been to have been in the company that's
[29:39] why I said make your election calling
[29:41] Shore don't think he's there
[29:43] make sure he's with you friends by
[29:45] checking it in the word Amen check it
[29:48] now see and they sought him from among
[29:51] their kin folk and acquaintances and
[29:53] they're doing the same thing today
[29:55] they're looking for God in the Baptist
[29:58] the Methodists the Pentecostal amen and
[30:01] speaking in tongues in a tent over here
[30:03] somewhere they looking for God as some
[30:05] teacher some false another one

[30:09] seeking God face among their relatives
[30:11] I'm only acquaintances when they should
[30:14] have turned to the word amen go back way
[30:18] I left them in the temple and then when
[30:20] they would have found them amen
[30:21] but no May it can't do the first he
[30:24] looks all out there for the word out
[30:25] there for the word is always in a humble
[30:28] place
[30:28] amen despised few amen those who deep
[30:33] the delight of the day as a spoke here
[30:37] is a night we sit how's it occur and
[30:39] also Micah back here
[30:41] can you imagine King Ahab and King
[30:44] Jehoshaphat sitting upon Thrones and
[30:46] said do we have the word Lord for a
[30:50] hundred true prophets of Israel came by
[30:54] one by one and preached their hearts I
[30:58] suppose 400 men from this message today
[31:01] came through here while I'm coming set
[31:03] over here who would you believe
[31:05] the 400 would you believe I was brother
[31:09] Coleman you would believe the word he
[31:12] had to work amen just want to catch you
[31:15] you would believe the Word of God but
[31:18] some most would believe in one of the
[31:21] four hundred because of for Monday's a
[31:24] warning from the message hallelujah he's
[31:26] in the message the same thing same God
[31:29] same blessing yeah because preach the
[31:31] word yes they would they said it then
[31:34] they'll say no they have already said it
[31:37] the message stands still oh no I'm not
[31:39] going away I want to go play I see it
[31:41] writes amen
[31:43] I'm free show you become an eagle eyed
[31:45] fly God
[31:51] but however Jehoshaphat was Spiritist
[31:54] but it got to be somebody else and to
[31:57] see the guy today that they know they
[31:58] can they can see these men come and go
[31:59] but there's something wrong somewhere
[32:01] they are waiting for that true witness
[32:03] on that two words amen on a true word
[32:06] therefore friends notice Jesus here now
[32:09] here they went looking all around for
[32:11] Jesus among the roses and their friends
[32:14] now notice now the word Jesus though
[32:18] young though he had been saved a long
[32:22] time long enough school you know I'm
[32:33] talking about you know exactly what I'm
[32:36] talking about
[32:37] the word though young speak for himself
[32:41] notice here now but when they supposed
[32:44] him to have been in the company I went
[32:46] and when a day's journey they sought him
[32:48] among their kinfolk and acquaintance and
[32:50] when they found him not to turn back
[32:53] amen they turned back the bread couldn't
[32:57] read it along the Pentecostals in the
[32:59] Baptist Methodist they turned back to
[33:02] the temple to the tabernacle where they
[33:05] saw God in a tabernacle Malachi 4
[33:09] the bread turned me just like married in
[33:12] here
[33:13] now notice now again to Jerusalem
[33:15] seeking Him and we do in right manner
[33:18] and it came to pass after three days
[33:20] after with death burial resurrection
[33:22] they found him in the temple praise be
[33:26] to God sitting in the midst of the
[33:28] doctors both hearing them and asking
[33:31] them questions and all that heard him
[33:33] were astonished and his understanding
[33:35] and answers well friends the word though
[33:40] young Amen
[33:43] spoke for itself himself he said I am
[33:46] about my father's business amen alright
[33:49] then this scene I am about my father's
[33:53] business no don't let us subpoena you
[33:56] all know what's going on there do you
[33:58] want a secret you don't know what's
[33:59] going on the inside of this Tabernacle
[34:01] alright it's right here there is the
[34:05] secret of the message I am about my
[34:08] father's business
[34:10] there's your secret there's your big
[34:12] secret we are about our father's
[34:15] business for he has revealed his secret
[34:17] his business
[34:18] for the area for the time and you about
[34:21] it craziest me I hope you don't miss him
[34:27] amen
[34:28] now friends what is the father's
[34:30] business to fulfill the word amen hey I
[34:35] saw Jesus Christ had to fulfill the word
[34:37] it is that simple
[34:39] that doesn't take a big solution to come
[34:41] in here and pound into your brain
[34:42] doesn't it's in a word to fulfill the
[34:46] word Jesus Christ because it is because
[34:49] Isaiah said behold a virgin shall
[34:52] conceive you had to wait until the
[34:55] virgin conceives and then that had to be
[34:57] fulfilled in Christ had to fulfill that
[34:59] amen and all of the other speeches in
[35:01] the Psalms and all down through there
[35:03] had to be fulfilled by the word itself
[35:07] Jesus Christ okay
[35:09] then Jesus had to fulfill the word now
[35:13] notice this now a little teaching in
[35:15] here I hope you get it the turn when he
[35:19] declared or testified or bare record
[35:22] that he was about his father business
[35:25] his father's business was when don't
[35:28] miss it
[35:29] was when he came of age 12 years old it
[35:35] was winner in the Pentecostal age
[35:37] because it wasn't of age are you getting
[35:40] it wasn't loofas age Wesley's age
[35:42] otherwise it wasn't when Christ was 10
[35:45] years old 8 years old 5 years old but
[35:48] listen now this is is according the word
[35:50] he says
[35:51] today word comes of age
[35:54] no no is this here at age 12 I don't
[35:58] want to miss this I have some notes
[36:00] right here on alright and age 12 Hebrew
[36:05] boys become a son of the law amen
[36:10] and age 12 they have the bomb mission
[36:12] and so forth at age 12 because according
[36:15] to what we understand they become a son
[36:17] of the law which means that their that
[36:20] they all enough to be a servant of
[36:21] Jehovah at this age they all enough to
[36:25] be a servant of Jehovah then friends
[36:29] when he was eleven ten eight or nine he
[36:32] could not say he was about his father's
[36:34] business but it wasn't until he was all
[36:38] enough to be considered a servant
[36:40] according to Hebrew law that he could
[36:43] say he was about his father's business
[36:44] or you understand well then we couldn't
[36:47] be about a father's business in the
[36:49] Pentecostal age for nobody knew what was
[36:51] truth Amen some thought it was tones
[36:54] some thought it was a Jesus name baptism
[36:56] and some for all kind of things but a
[36:58] perfect came at the word age when it was
[37:02] time and told us what the father's
[37:04] business was to fulfill the Scriptures
[37:06] amen did you understand it all right the
[37:11] word came of age to be about the
[37:13] Father's business when Elijah came forth
[37:16] in 1963 with a full square meal all the
[37:20] word a seven-course dinner amen
[37:23] the word came of age I hope you hit the
[37:26] snow the full word came into view the
[37:30] sacrifice came on the scene and the
[37:33] sacrifice when it walked the earth
[37:35] listen had the blood in it when Chris
[37:40] walked the earth it had the blood in it
[37:42] it was shut after
[37:45] right well the sacrifice the blood
[37:48] leaves the mercy seat and comes into
[37:50] Malachi for the word he that receiveth
[37:53] me if you deny that he is you shall
[37:57] perish therefore if they dinner the
[37:59] forward in Malachi for they will perish
[38:02] for the full word came into view Jesus
[38:05] Christ on your hands what are you going
[38:07] to do with him he went on trial he went
[38:10] all over the country is 64 going on
[38:12] trial did you miss it
[38:13] he would not sure so therefore we find
[38:16] him friends in that the full word could
[38:19] not come interview before 1963 because
[38:23] that was the Pentecostal age
[38:25] goo-goo-goo claim with the tongues
[38:28] fighting amen strength emulations and
[38:32] fussin and feudin and you know talk
[38:35] about amen and also Paul said when I was
[38:38] a child I spake as a child amen
[38:41] but when I grew up came of age and I
[38:44] become a man amen Christ become a man
[38:47] and was about his father's business
[38:49] therefore the bread was calling it to be
[38:52] about their father's business amen
[38:55] for their normal children put away
[38:57] childish things in all the fussin and
[38:59] feudin and jealousies and also pet hates
[39:02] and so forth put it away
[39:03] and be men that's what that's what the
[39:05] Bible says alright now we see the
[39:08] friends that we are to walk in the
[39:10] evening light being about a father's
[39:13] business before nighttime comes D
[39:16] Tribulation Period listen just as days
[39:20] since that is the end of a day
[39:23] well the dependi costal age set in
[39:26] evening time and it turns abruptly into
[39:30] darkness but thanks be to God he sent
[39:32] light in evening time
[39:34] amen God sent light to walk from the
[39:38] Pentecostal end of the age grace to walk
[39:42] right into almost into judgment the
[39:45] evening time light takes you in are you
[39:47] understanding amen amen
[39:49] praise God so therefore now we see them
[39:52] there now is the time that we know what
[39:55] to do for in a Pentecostal age there was
[39:58] all kind of heresies they had to be to
[40:01] manifest those that are approved but now
[40:03] we don't have to wonder we don't have to
[40:06] worry them awful we have the word we
[40:08] know exactly what to do we know who is
[40:10] off the word for the prophet has brought
[40:12] the word and we can see we can
[40:13] understand amen
[40:15] so now it is thus saith the word all
[40:18] right now cause presence and God's name
[40:22] is in the word that's why today if you
[40:26] have not been baptized in the name of
[40:27] the Lord Jesus Christ how can you be in
[40:29] his presence when his name is in the
[40:32] word that's why we are exhorted to
[40:34] repair the one of us and be baptized in
[40:36] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[40:37] the remission of our sins then we shall
[40:39] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now
[40:43] what actually something when Christ the
[40:45] floor word came he gave out a promise
[40:47] that write to his disciples they
[40:49] followed him and then this promise was
[40:51] manifested up in the upper room well the
[40:54] same Christ came through Malachi 4 with
[40:56] a promise to you that you will receive
[40:58] the Holy Ghost same same word same
[41:01] promise and is cut to be done but
[41:04] there's a weak glowing on now in hearts
[41:07] is hidden from the rest but God Himself
[41:10] is brooding over his people he's molding
[41:13] reshaping he's forming you into sons of
[41:16] God
[41:17] he's doing those who walk by the spirit
[41:19] that has been revealed through the word
[41:21] those who walk by that I'm molding them
[41:24] I'm shaping them they are a reproach
[41:27] they're going beyond the camp he's
[41:29] outside of the camp's amen
[41:31] they go beyond the camps and they lay
[41:33] hands upon the sacrifice in their they
[41:35] identify himself with Christ but notice
[41:38] friends in Exodus 12 this is only in
[41:40] evening time when you actually lay hands
[41:43] upon the sacrifice amen only Nev in time
[41:46] not the other agents not too dependent
[41:48] on stage because you can speak in
[41:49] tongues in amen and and and also the
[41:53] others you can shout and scream and
[41:54] holler but this Asian must be in the
[41:56] word so you lay hands on the word and
[41:59] identify it in the word amen okay now
[42:03] notice now as we finish reading here and
[42:06] when they saw him the 14th verse they
[42:09] were amazed and his mother said unto Him
[42:11] son one hen stout thus dealt with us
[42:14] behold thy father and I have sought thee
[42:17] sorrowing he said unto them how is it
[42:19] that you sought me wist ye know of
[42:22] wishing not that I must be about my
[42:24] father's business and they understood
[42:27] not the saying which he spake unto them
[42:29] and he went down with them and came to
[42:32] Nazareth and was subject unto them but
[42:34] his mother kept all these sayings in her
[42:36] heart and Jesus increased in wisdom and
[42:38] stature and favor with God and man
[42:40] now notice friends we see them that if
[42:43] we seek Him we shall find him now those
[42:45] who happens here when they found him
[42:47] they found out that he wasn't the little
[42:50] Jesus that they had taken update for
[42:52] something transpired amen
[42:54] when you heard the word
[42:57] your Pentecostal feast your pastors your
[43:00] friends your mother's bow that you was
[43:02] not that same little boy in your church
[43:07] you became of age you saw about my
[43:09] father's business if you were a
[43:11] trinitarian youto your pastors and your
[43:14] brothers and so forth that you want to
[43:16] get baptized and name the Lord Jesus
[43:17] Christ and they said why why I why I'm
[43:20] about my father's business you couldn't
[43:22] help it you come of age to believe all
[43:25] the Word of God it's the age of seat
[43:28] time it's prayer time
[43:30] you can't help but believe the Word of
[43:31] God is in you for these chairs a cry out
[43:34] to God they have to cry out they have to
[43:42] testify if God is in you there's not no
[43:45] horsin universe to keep you from being
[43:48] about your father's business that's
[43:51] exactly right
[43:51] praise God now notice now we find in
[43:56] that Jesus just like today a Jesus here
[44:00] he astounded Mary and Joseph all the
[44:04] ministers and the great bishops amen the
[44:07] doctors of the law Jesus a little tour
[44:10] the old word young tender sign and
[44:16] speaking my father said so who told you
[44:20] to say that did you mean the message
[44:22] because a brother rent a unit

[53:06] the spirit beloved don't believe all the
[53:09] spears trammel if they be of God and go
[53:11] on then smack in the face just like that
[53:13] a cosmic mother because like he's my
[53:15] Quaker he said we're spin a long ago and
[53:18] left me so you find when you finally go
[53:20] into your secret in a chamber
[53:22] you've the same spiritual figures on you
[53:25] now was not on you friend when you give
[53:28] if you go on your knees and go into your
[53:30] secret chamber the Holy Spirit will say
[53:32] Elijah's message thus set laws the dogs
[53:34] will lick because they have blood if you
[53:37] go into entertainment the Holy Spirit
[53:39] will reveal the message to your heart
[53:41] but he'd never hid because he didn't go
[53:43] in it but like I said when you do go in
[53:45] there you find how we're to spare the
[53:46] Lord minute it was in the word amen so
[53:50] we see friends in that over here when
[53:53] Jesus said mage's tremendous statement
[53:56] see Mary understood not what the word
[54:00] said there is chance did you marry is a
[54:05] chance the husk so Mary understand now
[54:08] under type in it singer Mary the
[54:10] Pentecostal Jesus name three guards
[54:12] whoever you want to call them understood
[54:14] not the word for they don't want to be
[54:17] about their father's business because
[54:19] they want to speak in tongues they want
[54:20] a man a bishop a big fat Bishop they
[54:23] want you follow me now to tell them what
[54:25] to do to give them war work to give them
[54:28] more straw and brick but if you will
[54:31] believe on him I'll set you free the
[54:34] truth shall make you free
[54:35] you won't have to make no more bishops
[54:37] throwing bricks no more aiming for you
[54:40] just believe on him that said that's all
[54:41] you free foot is steep did you believe
[54:44] time and I'm sure come on out but if you
[54:47] want to stay there the defeats your
[54:50] takes a whole and mark your ear in your
[54:53] denomination it screws it in there and
[54:56] you won't hear nothing no war that's
[54:57] right yes stay right there so but now
[55:00] listen this three years in here so forth
[55:03] how long I don't know there go on they
[55:06] go on preaching they go on praising they
[55:08] go on blessing God's name but they're
[55:10] lost and don't know it
[55:11] they don't know it see but the bride the
[55:14] hidden Rick is going on in the bride
[55:15] they go on blaspheming
[55:17] saying all kind of crazy things but it
[55:19] goes on anyway so if will Mary
[55:21] understood not what the word says she
[55:22] pondered these things in her heart
[55:25] today they are pondering now right now
[55:28] to learn this up everybody will know
[55:31] what is going on now all the big boys
[55:33] one big boy turned into Joshu eight down
[55:35] here North Carolina from out of Indiana
[55:37] but what but a brother Brad mentor name
[55:40] on a tape I'm a hitman so and so he said
[55:42] at the prophecy for fifteen years
[55:44] but cut how can he be because be Joshua
[55:46] is not revealed to him that's what the
[55:49] word says Amen all the big boys like
[55:51] they all gathering out here now they
[55:53] don't have a big feast
[55:54] Amen well I mean they must be right the
[55:57] Bible says four hundred was wrong and
[56:00] Michael was right amen
[56:01] so that's what don't look God purposely
[56:04] allows the big boys to strut and
[56:07] prophesy and you can see it just
[56:09] strutting up thicker thicker roosters
[56:11] just strutting around you follow me now
[56:13] but God's messes are Eagles they fly
[56:17] high up into the heavenlies they listen
[56:19] to the tapes they let the spirit Lord
[56:21] reveal the message to them
[56:23] they come forth nothing in themselves
[56:25] just humble like and present the Word of
[56:28] God they may look like anybody you found
[56:30] it now they look like something then God
[56:32] couldn't use him because no flesh shall
[56:34] glory in his presence that's hard for
[56:36] people to accept that they cannot do it
[56:38] but I can't help it I must go on I must
[56:40] be about my father's business amen now
[56:43] long in wandering trying to figure out
[56:45] what's going on the seed knows exactly
[56:48] where they can smack the seat and also
[56:51] turn off side that he know is that he
[56:52] stands still he shall not be move he's
[56:55] standing still haven't done all the
[56:57] Stansted anyway amen
[56:59] stand there praise God put up the shield
[57:02] of faith Christa fire it does he
[57:04] understand when God's when the pillow
[57:06] fight says move move but otherwise stand
[57:09] there we're standing right here was
[57:10] standing here with God's Word and we
[57:12] shout out move now notice now quickly
[57:14] the angels from God the messengers with
[57:18] a message right spoke and reveal just
[57:22] enough to Joseph and Mary are you
[57:25] reading me to enable them to know the
[57:27] mission of Jesus isn't it wonderful
[57:30] angels from God came messengers you know
[57:33] messengers came and revealed my dream
[57:36] also to also my dream and also because
[57:39] revealed the word to Joseph and Mary
[57:42] both of them just enough for them to
[57:44] know that Jesus was to save you the word
[57:47] just not to know that they would not
[57:49] trust in old law Haman just enough to
[57:52] know that they wouldn't trust in the
[57:54] pharisees and sadducees just enough to
[57:56] know to worship God and to know that one
[58:00] day soon he must be about his father's
[58:01] business amen all right

[58:09] heart to believe all that the Scriptures
[58:12] have said all the prophets have said
[58:13] amen well just like everybody else they
[58:16] was because slow to understand it to
[58:18] comprehend that's why God had to take
[58:19] his profit off the scene so that this
[58:21] perish sense but because just Semin
[58:23] January we're just moving that the slow
[58:26] and fools our heart would begin to

[59:36] holly started to grow in wisdom in the
[59:38] Statue of God

[59:49] needed by the Spirit of God brooding
[59:51] over molding you shaping you into sons
