TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so now I'm reading from second Timothy the third chapter xiii verse you all read with me what evil men no do the 12th fret I'm sorry yay and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution there's a will to do it there those who will do it did every now got to be your will to do it and if you do do it you shall suffer persecution see but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue thou in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of it's not wonderful praise God knowing of whom thou has learned them and that from a child thou has known deep the Holy Scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus all Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works it allows a blessing to the reading of his word now I like to title this little thought don't surrender your faith if there was a time for the people of God to know in whom they have believed in this is the hour if there is other time for the people of God to stand for God staying in this hour this is the OL prepare was exhorting a Timothy here young ministers he was urging him come telling him to stand firm in the faith of Jesus Christ it is more timely for this age here for the same word of God opens by vindicated prophet Paul to come right back here now and be for this very age here now this most are deceiving age but while it is the most deceiving age when all shall worship the Beast whose names is not written in the bloody Lamb's Book the bleeding worse amen this is the age of the eagle Revelation God saved this anointing know that as we've been listening to custody seals how the white horse rider change horses over to a red horse rider geez / - a black horse rider and all three cars come together up on a pale horse right and this writer it was riding now - taking the people to destruction and Daniel 8 it said that this beast would rise up a power and he would deceive the whole world by flattery by saying peace teeth or even the man out of the street has drunk know that there's one man saying peace to the well amen and yet the chick sees him riding that pale horse saying peace peace even now speaking - Johnston Johnson going over there because President Johnson going over it because to see him and to fall down on his knees I suppose and kisses ring I see and then say that he himself will intercede and make peace this is a a great year coming up and we could spit out our here talking about or what has happened this year but all of us we have seen it happen it was spoken that it would happen because to the world we with our eyes have seen this world if education just completely because fall apart as a prophet preached about for years available hell is falling apart the flashing rips time amen and he even spoke then about those beetles coming forth and sixty-two those demons from the pit and here they are now starting all of these hippies and also flower power sawed off from those beetles their demons rising up here you see on our satellites we see all these things the church in Hope in Israel and so forth well Paul in this kind of atmosphere in this kind of turn pile is short Timothy by the word here the necessity for holding firmly to the faith he's shown him why see still he's telling because Timothy that it is the means by which God makes us live or the salvation the only way we can be why is through the switches overnighted to make us rise or the salvation these scriptures that God breathed up all and make them live this is for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness because holy living in conformity to God's thoughts in God's mind not who we think is holy well then God makes holy by his blood you haven't because many holy men the pulpit Allah but then are holy because in God's or a man's of blood of Jesus Christ makes you holy see so now God use this one channel to get the man's face amen he operates through faith see in his work so therefore it is through faith in God's words that we might be perfect complete because thoroughly furnished unto all good works that he's ready just about now - do you find me now he's just about ready for that bride to take one yeah right well he said God's prophets little state was Eden she'll turn at the West one day and she'll write back and she'll take one more breath right amen and God Himself will write in the brown the pale horse ride he's riding but there'll be one more ride these signs shall follow them that believe the Word of God so we see them that God there knows that the scriptures this restored faith that Malachi flow restored back is the only means that God can use to protect the bride he can't do it by no other means only through his word and Satan knows that so Satan comes against this word with darkness doctrines of devils to produce the Brad or a friend that only means she had to grow by the Word of God and therefore that is his job that's why we say don't surrender your faith don't give it up don't let your grease hair on the carts or changing heat this faith message is absolute to us amen it is the final amen Oh beer it is it is something now with all but thanks be to God we have an absolute we had we know what's going to happen we see it popping all around us we know that this wheel is now on the way out the tip is getting up now he's ready to ride you see them now just even ahead well but the bride when I will come don't do nothing stand still and see the salvation of your God don't you try to do anything yes you spin there and behold the glory of God all around amen and God shall fight your battles don't get scared don't get nervous just spin there and say glory to God the prophets spoke it now here it is I know my heart is able a men and I will not bow down to any bales out here amen and if we assume in the fire and let God put me in there it's his will it is will be done for yourself God why we should not because they're in our faith like I say the only means by which God can protect us that's why it is the mean which while he can use to change the practice from image into his image from well glory to another go there's only through the word for as we've been hearing beware in a glass we were changed even as by the Spirit of the Lord and the spirit of the law have come down in in Word form no message that's why if you can't that was why over the word to read the word the word gives the Holy Spirit that's why it's the word so Isis in there the paw patroller he prophesized of token get out of the package it wasn't there yet but it was coming the tapping was a ton of man to reveal himself and Apostle worked out their last piece not my vision by Satan to the token is here alright and if you must have a detector because it kind of come on the scene those son of man come down and reveal himself don't worry a car that's this friend as the sixth year was open up they come down by vision came in all right when the vision come something was spoken from that vision the Word of God well then Word of God reveal each vision para so the word of the Lord told us it was the portal was a white horse riding so forth the word of the Lord told it that it was those dude on the altar it was the word of the Lord so then each seal was broken by the word amen it was the word of the Lord that told what was hit in the sixth seal then wrath any man now well then why is everybody's fall because Christine who's with the seventh seal just like he did with seal one two three four five and six been the rule of law and with the widow or the prophets beginning out on tape and there it is just like it's on tape the first seal the second to third to fourth to sixth the fifth it's the same thing and now the seventh seal is on tape oh ho don't worry wait long amen well we praise God just a minute because we get so excited we forgot to because I acknowledge system are--in the back here Cyrillic her daughter here we sure want to welcome you back sister Marie have my mind set just on this message is so now we see friends that we are not to surrender our faith for this place is the word faith is the revelation of God's will well then God's will came in the form of a message on tape then if you want to know what to do further h-here the tape read the Bible story so then write to me go now he told that we would be changed into his image even as by the Spirit of the Lord in Word form you father now and I still don't because of the gift for him you follow me now this time is the word for things and works for me now Timothy is warned that he won't have an easy time of it please amen he must stay like a rock I guess because increasingly cuz period waves of error that will beat against him that's why he says Christ says build your house on a rock when the waves come and the winds come and shake that half moon and the rock is Christ and we seem to be in this power of many houses falling now being blown down can be because Paul wonders that right there's a bear of the arrow coming deceivers who shall wax worse and worse they will go forth because bad to work being deceived and also just ceasing be a little spare yourselves by doctors because of devils and leading others away seducing spirits that the prophet sent is all religious people good people good people there are deceived with religious spirit upon and that's why this age is nothing but the where amen you sometime praise God for he said that he would see the rise of the worst immorality and wickedness in the world but I've said in the church that's where you'll see in the church and it's got to be in the word for Christ himself in the bigger a revelation Sidley I see is black healthy nasty all right and he spew out of her mouth now it's the same age the layoff the age was when every man did what he thought was right because of his own I see just like back in the tire law of judges every may have own doctrine please why because there was no profit on the singing to get God gives his will to the profit to work so back in judges God raised up your spies and those who because what would because thought of to prove his point just like he did those Pentecostal didn't mean now that's why he had a woman who was despised back there because Deborah a left-handed because assassin because giddy on different ones because it wasn't thought of much you follow me now what he does that see but also just about the end of judges because you had Eli priests and he had a because for two son and they was the priest and held a filthy aged in because there is no profit on the scene it kidding me now so we've seen in that guard people they always go spring see there's three things that happened the people go astray then a man of God from nowhere rises on the scene with a message from God because they could for the remedy enemy now then you can choose to take that remedy or you spit it out up to you then the next thing that happens after that traffic comes on the scene this God comes down himself here deliverance yeah it always happens that way he comes down himself he will deliver you himself so he comes down 40 couple delivery see to me now so therefore those priests back there they were laying with with the women right FD tika temple gates there and same age now Satan women popular the gospel money see and it was because filthy even here today movies TV books miniskirts sex is on the rampage that's all out there for Satan is using his to the woman you see the me announce see and he's taking the whole world into destruction then if Satan can get into the church he can anoint spirit man to come against the Ministry of the word of God through any means he can any always use of D three avenues Samson with women their money their popularity amen but the man of God you hate that man of God they're going to preach that work because like people like priests they want to heap to themselves teachers could have an engineer's also because accumulate to themselves teachers what God told us back in 1st Samuel 3 that when he speaks your ears will be tickle a table God says there and a Pingo right please pick this handle tamio and - notice God called him three times and ers that when a car to the spare time listen for God is ready to speak and in Godspell Samuel Samuel and Here I am Lord speak to that servant do you see the pail was ready to speak and we have service - here we are Lord speak and God says what I'm about to sing will ping on your ear it won't pick on them it'll be so powerful brother you'll see if they come off faith cometh by hearing hearing right to ear to hear the word of come amen so we see the enemy rather pick up on the scene all that live godly in christ will suffer persecution they will meet persecution don't use big because you won't meet it because the Bible says you will meet amen see you meet it because of your stand forward in time if you're standing for righteousness the church people they will hate you Esau didn't say a thing take it you just wait to their learning days are over is that right the Prophet died at 65 in about June 66 he said when asked the Jacob when they saw that the Prophet was wanna rise in a power resurrection there's a profit here already spoken already the seats are not there with the shock and then those spirits begin the class is the spoken word has it already gotta be Luther head to Bible well where'd that he was a priest but the word with close to him I meant nothing is there 29 hold your peace because I'll get it just a minute miles will take my time this morning amen because now feel good now wonder crazy outcry they are joking but not with wine this dagger but that was strong drink for the Lord is poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and hair close your eyes the prophets and your rule is to save happy covered now matters and the vision of all is becoming to you as the words of a book that is sealed is that right and in which could men deliver to one that is learn saying read this I pray thee and he said I cannot foresee the promise with the Word of God and the battement get it when he said that it must be a secret it must be because if I put it in secret Satan if he should get a hold of it oh he would impersonate it so the seventh seal the coming of Christ month they have already gone forth in secret it's a word for if Satan could get ahead of that fateful if he can only get it so now he said what is it see it's the word and if I don't know God made a poster whereas what understand because because she has the Word of God for like I say because the enemy uses money popularity and women is so forth see and we know that if a man will stand tied to this word he can't fail for the word of the absolute the terrible the rock that we stand on and no matter who says what their fingers because the hard faces touch your face against our made you are praised in the war or dispensed city I'm pillar dear my head your face and preach my word and Gemma I can't hold it back Lord his fire sharp in my home the word is high he's pleased as anything with the pride of the word of God amen the right friend so we see there that the word preached and then each member here works in the condition of the Word of God in the condition of the we're not because in your own minds now I see what he says Oh things'll Apple Paul says the rest everything is permissible because from be allowable the colossal see but not a things are helpful amen see good because expedient see because profitable when considered with other things now whatever is your desire this day consider first the Word of God with other things see go past it everything is lawful because for me he even said over in Frisco atheist 9 1 through 6 he said because can I lead about a wife or sister like you because Peter so forth because Kate I had eaten great and also because was because money cooperation says well what's the power was thanks to find himself Stephan himself apart those things because there they were due to ministry but power wants to do some more for God see me now it was laughable but in his case he was trying to set a pattern an example and therefore it was not expedient I see just like today is laughable for men and also women because they have husband and wives that's laughable what is that experience in the south that's what you got to understand and that's why you have so much because trouble day in the trenches so forth I want a husband become one away for whatever it is is that's laughs well yeah but is that expedient in this hour check out God's will then you know if you're moving in the right spirit and so many people do you see Jesus Christ he's tipped the example he goes for his bride amen the man goes for the bath Christ comes down is swoops down for his bride one here went over there to over there these foolish virgins see they go for the man you found it out what they go for the man part spiritual part flesh pad in the world power religious you follow me now see what the true bride beyond the mere cords of that were the will of God what do you want me to do long hair my speak thing for therefore any man if he living because for his bride he will good for his own bride yeah Christ went for his bride any man wants to go for it alright but other things are laughable but they're not expedient and I see so much today or people want this and want invest he leads the camp because I haven't perfect and all things shall be added onto us hey speakin one time twice no keep on seeking why for the worse is after you have taught him I purged you out and here you come again our purge again to bring forth the fruit amen and when you're sick as you have done everything now I'm suppose I had 100 or bigger otherwise all this half of a car whatever it is I have heard you from much fruit here it is my father glorified amen so you see as we approach this new year we want to preach the way that man and woman and child in this place we're back in the little car you don't know how long you will sit here like this you may not be here no more than one more month that's all and you may be scared and then you won't have to know what did you come here oh don't worry Oh because / mammoth what else the world what you want to come for let me say again you may not be here no more that's Dan one more night see now what are you coming here for think well I got things every man stick his own wife for Christ at the tank he picked his wife the bride he goes for her he has this desire like God type of the Branum gold get her that right he or else she could do shame face bratty never seen aware what praying Lord is this for me but never it's showing nothing just waiting the Prophet went and got his wife and he'd pull it to Miriam so for C so therefore left over here let's hit the cone here hate to say this here but they could have to say it and here we try to do all that we can to stay clean and a priest aware that God and this is the age where the devil will use women this precious sister sent here but there's they up there singing and praising God a man consecrated call of God this wrathful because for him to have a wife is it experience because here in his condition God has kept an eye the army become he don't have a wife tell me now well he's in camp on him here servant is here if he wants to because take a wife did it he goes so he knows his will God's will he speaks that will every day but this Paul a woman come in here she's looking like this here timid the gonna blame her ass alright send me now well she's looking dark anything so what is happening her desire to the female its striking him and I'm sitting right here looking at the whole thing and she's looking at his striking him the next thing you know he'll fix problem is in his mind and thickness got him then he can't sing the wall because it can't play no more or you finally free these things must be sense when you understand that this is hardly any kids break up a church deacon ministers and so forth you've been over this back and forth and back and forth but that had no way of doing it there's better Eddie right here and sister of Deacon iris he come to me and tell me then he because what he has his hard for her I never you know anything about it that's what it was done that does it today we know that does the thing it just happens like that what he tell me he wanted hair so he went together and any man nothing then he goes to get his wife she don't run after him now he goes he goes to get her and also because she don't tell everybody the whole church she tells God and if that's that last wife before the foundation of the world God he's got something in there for her she could be ugly she could be any kind of cuddle whatever it is but he must have something here for that woman then they just come together naturally and God does the same to me now for therefore the deal I preached they wouldn't tell the people that they live with those women physically so forth and today's spiritually these hath Christ well tell them either spiritually they just take the money and do what they want to do see so we say all these things that we approach this new year reverently this is God's house in here you want to keep this place clean this pet that is dedicated to the way to reverence in God's hands not the hell out of Fortune because we're carrying on in the house of God do you mean them God has blessed us here above and beyond where we have tried to feed tied to the Word of God see right there see so now I can say all things are lawful what is it expedient you check that out see so now we see friends that like I say Christ goes the hunt for his own bride see now he said because Timothy they will tried to pass on you dear Anka's era see which opposes the doctrines see little did we know that in this hour we because the DVB prophet told us but my eyes in my ears have seen people in this message that you know us on the phone by letter brother colony on minutes on the phone oh because about two months ago told me that nobody has the Holy Ghost and this same man turning ha he was telling what the Holy Ghost years ago turn right around says nobody's got it cuz he don't feel nothing on the phone brother I busted the way that got registry I said you don't haven't got it what don't you miss me recap I never recant in his heart here he goes in there he's been the one half at me so all these year then Christ against every kind of barren have come in here all kind of things have happened right here before your eyes but it's been the word hole in the word not looking at the couny people but looking at the way the guy hitting me now look at the word every spirit many popularity women a devil possess that inspire half accusation so come against the ministry here when it's been the work homeland on the Word of God amen so this brother it's in ears and so forth another one precious brother call me on the phone Tamara brother Joe don't you get deceived by this false love spirit about loving your brother business I was shocked beyond belief this man that I know him tell me I'll get a fast spear to love my brother's past ecumenism spirit so I said well brother all I know is that the virtue for this agent brotherly kindness that's the word therefore I can do so you for this very age of seven ratio is probably kinda yeah but it also says the little mini shall wax cold so his leg with waxing : what can I do but I know the brother in the master another one I just received a letter last week the week before last he told me he says now that he has a good to admit the conductor says he does not have the holy go now he can approach the statue of a perfect man so believe he's approach and it's broken he finally now he's dripping over where the toughest very message is the baptism of the holy ghost 3 he explained it that right that's the heart of his message you see the me now now is the word age and his brother says now that he sees that now he's the senior and doctrines of devils in the last days wine horse riders son of man doctor all kind we're at in the message over it who brother Brown over there a brother went over there with a dream and told other Brown that brother Branham was Jesus Christ a lot of Lord and the king of kings and preach this whole mess that's right the man is the seed so docking of a devil see my friends for therefore we see then all of these things happening now see but we see then that this is the album that we are not just facing because denying of this or that it is the complete repudiation of the Christian thing they are absolutely denying everything about it and the method has come already and there's a path for knowing that was arrived against it in the message friends in the message you see it now see 4 therefore God said that seducing spirits would be up on the people now many would have a form of godliness see what would deny the way then if they deny that nothing is now going on they're saying god is dead and this is a spirit that was taught it way back then if god is dead love is dead mercy is this brothers did have nothing here now till now for therefore pastor that they would deny the power of the word then the power of the word is now working in the breath changing her but they say no I don't feel nothing Mary Sarah fear me to come to the word not sensation see is the living hear me now or giving up here amen so he said from such turn away all right I'm touched because turn away David said in Psalm 11 if the Foundation's be destroyed what can the righteous do what can we do if this foundation that we have received back if it's destroyed what can you do men most miserable is that right that's exactly right but this founder he cannot be destroyed for God has pasted in a heart a man a man in the heart you see for therefore the surrender of your restored faith see them you know will make you lose love kindness mercy everything so love is not dead see no siree amen amen breathe God so now those who say nothing is going on now because because in effect they have seen God is dead and yet God's prophecy that the shot has come therefore see is dead in the message sister then they say love is dead also and now our love is not dead love is a virtue which is a seed now is growing amen love is not a human virtue that arises naturally human's heart Oh love is a plant a seed that God has planted in a in a heart of faith amen and that seed now is now growing now maturing now alright me right before you are and those who are manifesting that they are this because persecuted by those who don't have that I think that may what is going right now see so therefore this love is a plant that God has planted in the heart praise be to God don't surrender your faith friend no sir be kind one to one another and love ye one another Amen see now God will take care of you heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall never pass away see God kiss will his worry I was listening to a tape the other night and brother bran was speaking about our fellow that they used to call rabbi Lawson he's a minister because way back in the thirties there and it's brilliant because preaching so forth and but it's wife's because she wasn't a Christian and she used to get so man stirred up one day she took his Bible and stuffed it in a stove and also burning up about a year later she was fixing her Christmas tree and God burn her Oh God taste giveth word friends doctors Bible into the furnace and burn it up they didn't say anything God burned her up see the same word brother BAM told you and the 37 flood was placed right on the pulpit and went up didi flood come in and up and went to the ceiling same Bible open right on the same page come right back down heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall never pass away in it well then if that is a piece of paper in a black Hobbit book and he takes care of that amen so he'll take care of us all that word is in you and God is on your high heaven and earth shall pass away my words shall never pass away praise be to God amen let the word be in you then and he'll take care of you let it dwell in you and all richness amen praise God now because enclose he coming down the line you cannot act with faith until you first know what you're doing you just can't do something to know what you're doing see now you've got to know first what you're doing before you can have faith to do it amen okay then see must be based on some notice back amen praise God I was just smiling because I was thinking about the code Emily Post how everybody baits their face on what she says taking a fork and also breaking lettuce and so forth week I like it take a knife and cut it but he says you must break it with the fall and people had Saints in that if you went to their house you look kind of strange is that right dewy nothing had faith in that well then what about the Word of God amen to the men now what so that was Emily Post words but we have got to work hurry it's all gone for now we can base our faith on absolute at Apple it has been proven down to all the Angels see we want to know what is God's desire what is his plan then when we know what it is we can approach him and plead for whatever promise lays in his plan for the sake amen so now you can approach him now he'll take care of you now I mean now will his plan for this age now like I said because three things happens the people get away from God God sends a prophet could you find it beckons because judges they're judges 6 1 through 7 the people fall away judges 7 through 10 he says a man of God from nowhere he just arrives on the scene and come with a message the same man that got rolled up and also totally lie the same thing a man of God come out of nowhere and just preach the Word of God did it me now dance it out and end up walk away it's all sleep for now then you get out the message in between is a testing time whether you're gonna stay with the words or move away from the word see now we were promised in this hour that the sun is shining all right that's how farmers its own which because come out and shine well notice now if you see a cloudy day the Sun is still shining you know but you can't see it right right never stop shining what clouds are there amen well now the funds have come out to share now for the Bible said that Malachi 4 would come and the light would come out and shine what many don't see it cuz they have clouds in the way if there gets those clouds of that they'll see the sunshine boy is the same Sun is right there yeah amen

to do don't you have anything set no siree this year now you don't know where you'll be last year some of you have to cuz you because you beat because moving this year we didn't know that we would have a little child on the way this year I didn't know that put the calling myself you never know what's gonna be see well you just keep praying trying to stay in God's will just keep looking for the Lord Lord what shall you have your unprofitable servant do this day that's all when can I be a blessing to the day I asked the Lord cannot bless somebody the same thing that's the Lord immensely now so we see they got our mouth because they got all the clouds out of the way getting on fresh out as week in sequence like cuz right now they go around down see now go like I say a miracle now we all are waiting for this miracle to come right the miracle of the transformation praise our God the miracle that will be in a resurrection how would it be we're so so this is gonna be like don't touch take it out now just wait see but you got something to do before the miracle come act and believe the Word of God act on what has been spoken and and just believe it then watch the miracle go for you know go see the miracle of the rapture amen Paul a miracle how he's gonna do it see what he's gonna do it though see so now like we say Samuel there was one vision ahead and all of Israel knew that the word of the Lord with them one dish their vision the Prophet had tells the time thousands of visions and they still fight him dearly now get down one vision to the Jewish prophet and all Israel from Dan down to Bathsheba they all knew that's the word a lot was with him see and he had to speak it out and for therefore Eli was judged by a prophet and Samuel had to come and tell Eli exactly what that prophet says but when Samuel said it then God was placement in season then Simeon know so therefore because a hair I mean it's because Elijah said it because against a hair but then Mike replaced it in season C so God says it first come back over here and speaks it out into spoken word then fish justice ain't spoken worth checking out because because quickly made a line or was because Martin Luther he stays a priest and they had the Word of God could justification that couldn't do anything until he second when Martin Luther sketch out justification it lived in the heart said right he had to speak it first off and Wesley the Pentecostal narrow this ace now D rapture each the Prophet had to say because resurrection and also rapture all these things and now we see them coming to pass he had to speak it out first amen the see it male friend thanks now okay because in closing then I what I'm trying to say this morning I'm trying to say by God's grace that God is trying to get us to listen that's all well you see it's after because three times because he put a line knew that he told Samuel when he speaks again now you listen see for now because three poles God reveals his words in three and seven so we've seen the third Pole and the seventh angel this is three offenses now God's raised because so to Raziel its word and his word was revealed to me now be the Apostles and also early church learn to oh Christ as the head of the church and we can prove this thing you turn access team and we still why the head of the church now that was the prophets great revelation that let Christ the head have the preeminence in you cinema now just let them have deeper eminence in you we steal what x-15 that certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren instead except ye be circumcised after the man of Moses you cannot be same in now these were people indeed Jerusalem church all right and they had the people down at F though because Antioch all shook up down there and so much soul that Paul and Barnabas because they have arguments down and so forth and also disputing so then they had to go up to Jerusalem now we notice that also here Paul got up there and also testified to Peter testifies Barmes testified things explained them because about God and also chlorophyll on Gentiles and all the signs wonders and miracles so they call them listen then James the pastor of the church now watch this this is maybe we need to understand it you understand the Seventh Seal what no what is taking place now up to this time just prior to this the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the Gentiles that's the house of Cornelius then these brethren in the message see wanted them to be circumcised to be saved and the blood station but they had to be circumcised just like today you got to go out here to Arizona you got to bleed a fellow man you got to bleed white horse rider no after this this man that so all kind of crazy things jimin's you must do this here to be in the message is the same spirit same exact spirit thing for now okay in a time like that before that God spoke to the fathers because by the prophets when in the last days he speaks by Jesus Christ is the word that right alright James knows they had the word in them now here with men with the baptism of the Holy Ghost in them and they still have disputing here all right but what happened because they didn't have this the New Testament yet Paul has it and all here did you know well now the Holy Ghost must speak but when he speaks it must be according to the word for what James come forward here in the 13th verse and the sixth verse it says and apostles and elders came together forth to consider of this matter the 13th verse after they had held a peace James answered fan men and brethren hearken unto me Simeon has declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people the fourth name the cookie Nielsen MC now and to this the Spirit has done something already amen now watch him now and says this agree the words of the prophet but he's chicken what happened on those Gentiles with the Bible no matter if no matter how pulsating how many visions and dreams of what they felt if that's written in this word it was nothing to do with it see so okay and to disagree the words of the Prophet as it is written there is your written we're right there just written out thing and he goes on to explain because he quotes out of here from back here and one of the prophets because the aim is back yes right and he says it in all times because after if I will return and will build again the tabernacle days it which is falling down and I will build again the rooms thereof and I will set it up that's the residue of men might seek after the Lord and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called fit the Lord who doeth all these things known unto God are to his works from the beginning on the world now he took the word of God and place it what the spirit had done see now then he declared his own now over Envy [Music] 28th verse now here's the words spoken because for the age for it seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us and to us but they said because to the holy go first by the words we would say it seemed good or calm to what the prophet has spoken on the tape and to us because that was the Holy Spirit speaking you finally know things so therefore now notice and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things that you have seen from meat off of the items is that in the words the sure is what the Holy Spirit speak you know he's to get what's in the way so what's on the tape is in the word finally now and so forth and from blood and from things strangled and Strumica fornication all that is in the Word of God Tim you know all right now Jesus being a head of the church steps it down by the written word so we just heard it see and he said to them but because by the Holy Ghost which was speaking out of James see now the written word and the Holy Spirit all because the goal is agreeing see now notice to accept the written words about the spirit can lead to a form of godliness see other words you say yes Malachi Forster this here and brother brannis will do all these things see and that's it see that's about the spirit you know what this because written were supposed to do with me what to accept the written word see by the spirit in you see the Spirit of God in you telling you and saying this so see and also by the Holy Spirit speaking that leads you into spiritual maturity but it must be in you yeah the Holy Spirit must be and you'll cease to speak because then you understand and it dovetails together do you follow me print all right this a kind of deep this I hope you understand it what is you can't explain it to me now but this was the pattern that's the early church sent for from the time James spoke that that's set in motion the time that because right after that because Paul went out and D because Gentile came in said alright what the Ford hairpin God allowed this mishmash to be and he might speak his word see how there's no so he allowed it let's see a mishmash for the word to come down and speak it out and put it in order now I've been that word is spoken then these things they can now happen exactly what happened for therefore the Holy Spirit now is speaking now in all matters now on all matters you see so what as we approached this because new year friends it's not long left here can you believe it there we see it put it but this is apparent to exhort you all things are lawful but please check it out with the word see if that's what God wants for you now because a bear can anoint you and you can even because record whole church for wanting the strange desires and so forth and even because natural desire cinema now so you'd be a normal spirit and unless God lift that spirit you'll never know it you will you'll be deceived you can be nice and kind and go right on but if the Lord doesn't lift that veil for you you never see it doesn't hit you you see me now for therefore many have it could wanted certain things and now they're sorry that's right just things they thought they wanted the same thing I always make sure to check that because filter out students because the Word of God I think advanced filter there are too late just because half has at least want to just come to church go to church see know or seek the Lord seek God sees so now um the method has come now if Satan is he could get because get ahold of it he could do great damage which we understand see what he can well God has hit it in the bride's so now we see then that the Seventh Seal message enclosing the Word of God has been spoken it's been spoken now because for this age many people thought it was a great thing to happen 10th this and hopeful and so on we don't because dispute that but we only say what he says he says any vision must be in the Word of God his vision said that no water with knowing better I then was a great secretly in there are seven sons of secrets lays beneath the seal see no one no one doesn't know it sing then he opened up the seventh seal rubbish Nate one and it was solid there was division dovetailing with the Word of God and no one would know it it wouldn't be are the kind of open vision taught it to the world out here see but the other learned other words when he said the white horse ride was the Pope the cove I know that now right but when he preached all this messages from 63 to 65 they still don't say anything so why is that then why is that they understand the second seal the second the first in fear but the seventh thing up and on the statement they said well people to do this here it's looking up the coast and the progress record is over here yet he did the same thing in the seventh year that didn't stick to that right see to me Mara he told it would be that way that's giving honor them they would brush it out in secret while you follow the whole that few because getting a nice new move 300 there now brushing out what God gives in the policies he has given the week but you must because this out in your life see let that word come out of the shop you take it in your fresh away the chaff in the natural that right now in a spiritual just fresh here it must diamond and the Word of God inside must come out why his wife we see now the Son of man has revealed himself now God created man in his own image this image was lost in Adam's sin that right well he restored this image in the second Adam crack this image come back to because Alpher better right because back in the early church and that was the image of God in the early church then it was the Carissa Polycarp then it was lost but there's a cop and one glory that right because I bleed then a taco listen glory and also because of shift in now I have come back to the original glory what is right thing now is not because going abena seat is now a seat you are now a seat of God because I going to be seen for now we have changed into this image from one glory to another glory even as by the Spirit Lord now it is very easy for us to because for your own image what we think it should be in this hour now there's many spirits s dissing what it is now they're all around see me now so we can only say with hip in the Word of God here it must be in the word ago Amen all right it is the image of Christ that has been restored print the restoration because comes about by the Spirit of the Lord man now don't miss this friends the image of God has been restored to God's prophets he has restored the living image of Christ in human flesh upon the earth that's been seen see me now now is day by day see one state of gory took because to another one as we yield self so as you hear yourself you go from this lorry because of that Lord as you heal yourself see in this manner the life of Christ in earth gives expressions and words and deeds see that all might see that Jesus Christ is alive and resurrected in the bride and he is the word but right and he will shortly come to vindicate this word amen when it happens his words are heard his deed foreseen that right amen and the wisdom and the knowledge of God is revealed I thought it did you seven things yeah and this happened and William Branham the deeds were seen the words of spoken the wisdom and the knowledge come out and there it was there was God Himself and yep we thank God because in this hour now God has given us grace to understand this here so we say to you as we approach this new year there will be one more ride Jesus Christ will come down and rise to the same hearts all over again that he has already written again there will be one more ride and so until then until he actually makes that ride don't surrender on your face hey man hold to God's unchanging handprint let us not make any resolutions because for this new coming year here please let us ask God for mercy and let us ask him for great let us keep on asking him now so now we see them that I myself I want to rededicate because my whole life to reverence here in this pulpit and also because reverence is just word and try to live all it because I can live because of this because of this word of God here let Christ to live through me God make all kind of mistakes you see but I know this that there's a blood atonement there and as long as we try just try see me now Christ is with his word friends and we've all been because failure because we all we sought out last year wanted to do so much to the Lord this year it's all like because like broken glass down there city man now but God has put all of these pieces together you can put them together think so I believe that as we approach this new year that we should sincerely and really dedicate our lives to Christ all things are lawful but not everything is expedient and whatever the Lord wants you to have I say this because the wit come with it because Reverend he'll give it to you but to seek the Lord first and in could are your conversation among brothers and brothers and sisters and sisters and so forth let the words willing speak on the things of God did you mean now if you speak on carnal things and your conversations your walk in the flesh you sure will and you won't because create an atmosphere around you and you'll find that you'll walk in that atmosphere and when you come in here if you condemn anything that will be preached you see if and emcee see them you know what's for there for the bride I don't know how to say it to you but I just trying to we hear her try to say with this word please this pulpit here is holy is God's holy ground here we try to live the word and preach this word and also act on the word that you might see because he faints and it's word here I believe that this nothing does know there is no other message this message is the absolute in it I believe that Jesus Christ has have already come flip down on the earth already with a message to his people this has been because going on since the seventh seal message many still laugh and joke and jeff's and foolishness and so forth what has been the time of the investigation judgment so therefore he's so loving and so saying he would not slip up on you so without telling you first so he comes down in his profit highs and humility tells you what he wants you to do till his word see tell you so much because it could make your ears tingle then the people that's looking for something else they don't they miss that word all the time and they saying I'm under the blood but he told Eli no more will I'll purge out your iniquity all right the prophets hold that so therefore that's the same thing today the Prophet he's come along and told these foolish virgins you're not under the blood you see it now friend they're not under the blood they think they are because the blood perfect scene so therefore only the Bryant's heat up heat under the blood you see so therefore how much should we be thanking God that we have a clean place in where we can come and also hear the word of God see me now we want to try to keep this place clean we'll keep your desires clean and also holy when you're away from here and when you come in here you'll be looking for Jesus what are you looking for this year are you looking because are you looking for the Word of God are you looking for this for that thing look for the Word of God in your life look for Jesus Christ I'm just trying to exhort you to stand here and knowing that there's something 6:00 in the Hamptons and like I say we don't know where we will be next year for this we know we want to establish as we go forth that every man knows their own job and what it's supposed to do somehow because soon we may have to meet in homes and so we all know see me now but we thank God that we have had this this opportunity here you know that it's been three and a half years exactly that we've been here he says June 64 to cause jet cook because a December 67 Trina has yes exactly and last year I think we spoke to in June about this place here and so forth it's about three years then and we know that a ministry that's because the man will have and so forth it won't go off the cutting further than that see but this has been the Ministry of the word this grows on and on and on didn't mean now wasn't a shock ministry then the man still the Word of God but it's just one because you can't stop this see so we don't set any time limit we don't know see but we know that three and a half years has been we don't know the standards of the perfection in the Bible a between the hand speed I don't know you know now but you don't know where Tantra you don't know could have started from 66 65 you don't know didn't know but one thing that we do know 67 has finished many things there his wheels back the Pope is now riding the hippies black Paul flower power riots murders rapes we see all of these things is that right friend and here we have a chance now to come and also to hear the word of God those of you as sitting in here today if you have not been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I exhort you friends just is because quick as you can if you understand and if God has revealed to your heart that he is the Lord the Christ in your life then you obey Him and be baptized in water in the name of Jesus Christ you may say Odegard believe god yes and they come and they stiffen it sickness it and they still get baptized and so forth things but if you say you are supposed to be a Christian then the first things what you have to do it you have to come and be baptized take on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you see well now like I say in closing a few other things and wanting to say but I suppose that what's been said has has been said C so therefore um we pray at you understand our purpose our desire that how we wanted a witness ministry here to be the fruit of the prophets message it's been hard because you had to save many cutting things which you don't take back you never take back the Word of God no so don't ever do that thing you got to speak it by faith in other words don't even say it they never compromise with the word they just speak the words by face knowing that they won't understand it if nobody understands it you've got to have faith that you're speaking and God since you must have it and many left hands and we're gonna sing so yes you but their blood is up on your hand and until you say it then they see that the blood they're hanging against them that's why it must be said yes now you see why until Luther said it you can't speak it off with had to speak it out the Frog had just saying he had a hard message to bring known and wouldn't nobody understand what he was doing they wanted some other things a great healing ministry when he's bringing judgment thanks so now French the world at the end we're going into this 1968 here at the era of human rights let us pray that God by His mercy and grace well let's just be the year that he will express his righteousness because grew up as they expressed what's in their hearts out here you could you're gonna see it let us pray as I will Express through us see what because in our heart the righteousness of God the Word of God therefore let us love one another as we approach this here because come back tonight and think on these things here and remember all things are lawful but not everything is expedient remember that friend and therefore then you you keep your mine rise and you keep your heart right and you won't trap somebody into something and thinking that they should do this head because you think because you do it see the fair law has said every man Springs in the word the word I got it set it free each individual see this solemn because before God each individual therefore don't spy on nobody's Liberty now so you can because talk up something and make it seem so real devil disease well this just this because should be just discus way but it never comes the way you think it is always a different way amen shall we

seek the word of God Lord may you and all things on to them after they continually continually continually seek the words and then God's by that time will be so dead to the things in the flesh so dare to the things in the world and Lord as we approach this new year many things going on the persecutions and so forth Lord and God all the godly that live got it because in Christ father they shall
