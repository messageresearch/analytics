[1:25] amen
[1:26] [Applause]
[1:27] see you had the right song praise the
[1:30] lord
[1:34] picked out the right song brother paul
[1:37] when he up against the struggle that
[1:39] shatters all your dreams
[1:42] and your hopes have been cruelly crushed
[1:45] by satan's manifested schemes
[1:48] that's when many of you fold up in
[1:51] and
[1:51] put it in your suitcase and go gone down
[1:53] a road railroad track somewhere
[1:55] lost and feeling sorry for yourself and
[1:58] gone
[2:00] and you feel the urge within you to
[2:02] submit to earthly fears
[2:05] don't let the faith you're standing and
[2:07] seem to disappear
[2:09] hold on
[2:11] please don't give up
[2:14] praise god
[2:16] what should you do praise the lord
[2:18] he can work through those who praise him
[2:20] praise the lord for our god inhabits
[2:23] praise praise the lord for the chains
[2:26] that seem to bind you serve only to
[2:28] remind you
[2:30] that they drop powerless behind you when
[2:33] you praise him
[2:36] true but many can't get that revelation
[2:40] amen
[2:42] now satan is a liar and he wants to make
[2:45] us think that we are poppers when he
[2:47] knows himself we are children of the
[2:49] king
[2:51] see his only thing he can do friends he
[2:54] was defeated at calvary
[2:58] he was defeated
[3:00] so the only thing he can do is to work
[3:04] through your minds
[3:07] that you fail and god won't forgive you
[3:11] that's the only thing he can do
[3:13] and work through brothers and sisters
[3:14] flesh
[3:16] also amen to come against you
[3:18] amen
[3:20] but more seem to
[3:22] be defeated by what the devil tells them
[3:24] actually than
[3:25] other brothers and sisters bothering
[3:27] with them amen
[3:29] so he's a liar
[3:31] so lift now watch here's what i wanted
[3:33] to strike so lift up the mighty seal of
[3:36] faith
[3:37] for the battle must be won
[3:40] we know that jesus christ is risen so
[3:43] the works already done thank you
[3:46] that's what i was doing trying to do
[3:48] last week
[3:50] well praise god
[3:52] for the mighty seal of faith
[3:56] oh
[3:57] praise god
[3:59] now we're on the beam now brother
[4:02] praise god i invite you your attention
[4:06] to saint john
[4:08] 20th chapter revelation 8.
[4:12] i'm coming back and trying to finish up
[4:14] what the lord told me to do
[4:16] amen and my inspiration has been you
[4:19] know this year to try to get the message
[4:21] to most of these new people that come in
[4:23] here after 1980
[4:25] and so they understand what this message
[4:27] is amen
[4:30] so i want to read from saint john 20
[4:38] and i'll just pick up where i was at
[4:39] last week
[4:41] i never got over to saint john 20.
[4:43] uh i was detoured over to the royalty
[4:46] mayor somewhere
[4:48] about six hours of trying to hit the
[4:50] scriptures scriptures said
[4:53] and it was full unbelief and everything
[4:55] and then toward by the evening uh they
[4:58] constrained him to come in
[4:59] but he had upgraded them and rebuked him
[5:01] for the unbelief amen
[5:03] well praise god so we won't bother with
[5:06] that
[5:07] that was last week answer under the
[5:10] bridge as far as i'm concerned
[5:12] amen it's quite a time on the road to
[5:13] emmaus i don't want to get back on there
[5:15] again
[5:15] amen verse 24
[5:18] uh but thomas one of the twelve called
[5:20] didymus was not with them when jesus
[5:23] came
[5:24] the other disciples therefore said unto
[5:26] him
[5:27] we have seen the lord but he said unto
[5:29] them except this is thomas speaking now
[5:32] except i see in his hands the print of
[5:35] the nails and put my finger into the
[5:38] print of the nails and thrust my hand
[5:40] into the side
[5:41] notice his burden that's a heavy burden
[5:43] i will not believe
[5:47] that's a powerful revelation there huh
[5:50] i will not believe mean and arrogance
[5:52] say i'm not going to believe it
[5:55] see what you're facing here i will not
[5:56] believe them thunders
[5:58] i will not believe in perfection
[6:02] no i will not
[6:03] he's a believer though amen
[6:06] praise god he's in the message man
[6:09] so uh
[6:10] he he laid out his his his uh theses
[6:13] here
[6:15] amen
[6:16] praise god it probably got a d for it
[6:17] amen but he laid it out anyway
[6:20] praise god amen
[6:22] and after eight days again
[6:24] his disciples were within and thomas was
[6:27] with them he made sure he came to church
[6:29] that sunday
[6:31] today
[6:32] because all during the week uh uh they
[6:34] told them on wednesday night are you
[6:35] crazy the lord is risen man
[6:38] praise god and they phoned him up and
[6:39] told him so so finally he made sure he
[6:41] got came in here this morning and he was
[6:43] praising the lord this morning
[6:45] amen praise god
[6:48] amen and with them
[6:50] uh and after eight days again his
[6:52] disciples were within and thomas with
[6:55] them
[6:56] then came jesus
[6:58] the doors being shut
[6:59] and stood in the midst and said peace be
[7:02] unto you
[7:03] then said he to thomas or reach hither
[7:05] thy thing he knew what he wanted and
[7:07] behold my hands and reach him with my
[7:09] hand and thrust it into my side and be
[7:11] not faithfulness but believing and
[7:13] thomas answered and said unto him my
[7:16] lord and my god
[7:18] whenever this happened what he done he
[7:20] got a revelation that jesus was jehovah
[7:25] that's what the lord means
[7:28] and jesus was god that's elohim
[7:31] so he's saying my jehovah and my elohim
[7:35] what a revelation
[7:37] if thomas is here this morning to get
[7:38] this revelation my god
[7:41] jehovah can speak squirrels and things
[7:44] elim can come down to time of life
[7:46] seal you with the seal of faith
[7:50] they can only believe
[7:52] [Music]
[7:53] yes sir jesus said unto him thomas
[7:55] because thou has seen me thou has
[7:57] believed blessed are they that have not
[7:59] seen and yet have believed
[8:02] in revelation 8 1 praise god
[8:05] just to tie it in here
[8:07] uh and when they he had opened that
[8:09] seventh seal there was silence in heaven
[8:11] about the space of a half an hour shall
[8:13] we bow our heads in the word of prayer
[8:15] almighty god
[8:17] you come back again on the eighth day
[8:18] and the disciples were within and this
[8:20] time thomas is here
[8:23] and lord we pray god
[8:25] that you do something like he did back
[8:26] then
[8:28] hallelujah
[8:29] to change every thomas in here lord
[8:32] anybody else that don't understand or
[8:34] don't believe
[8:36] praise god
[8:37] may the fire come down today and reveal
[8:40] their names in the book praise god and
[8:42] pour out the holy spirit
[8:44] amen and to those that will see this
[8:46] tape hereafter
[8:48] may the fire fall praise god amen fall
[8:51] out here today
[8:52] lord strengthen my body to finish this
[8:54] message amen
[8:57] praise god

[9:02] healed myself
[9:04] while i'm on the battlefield

[10:04] so i appreciate your brother singing
[10:05] that song
[10:06] this morning
[10:07] it didn't make a difference amen praise
[10:09] god brother norman i'd like to take a
[10:11] little title then came jesus
[10:15] amen
[10:16] and my subject is
[10:18] the easter seal see a little carryover
[10:21] is the seventh seal mystery of god's
[10:23] finished redemptive work
[10:25] [Music]
[10:27] so i'd like to kind of speak on to these
[10:29] people that don't understand this
[10:30] message here
[10:31] amen my inspiration
[10:33] is the original faith is the
[10:35] resurrection faith
[10:38] amen
[10:40] so now um from last week's sirens this
[10:43] time for the the manifestation of the
[10:45] seven thunders
[10:46] like i said somehow we got sidetracked
[10:48] over to the road to mayors last week i
[10:50] never got into this here and it was
[10:52] quite a time just fighting and defending
[10:54] yourself amen so i just want to finish
[10:56] up today on the seventh angel and his
[10:58] message to the last day brian
[11:02] because the holy spirit is going to fall
[11:03] and you got to know what they got to
[11:05] have the seed to fall on
[11:07] amen
[11:09] and this is the pentecostal age and a
[11:10] lot of new people here and they don't
[11:12] know that so this is the pentecostal age
[11:16] and on the mind events made clear by
[11:18] vindicated prophecy
[11:20] amen uh just to
[11:22] bring it into you
[11:24] and uh page
[11:25] 10
[11:27] and brother abraham said on page 10
[11:29] of paragraph 56 we're not living in a
[11:31] pentecostal age
[11:33] we're living
[11:34] in another age
[11:36] see we're not living in a methodist age
[11:39] we're living in another age we're living
[11:41] on up here to the brine age
[11:44] that's what i've been telling you now
[11:46] in the bright age all these years since
[11:48] the prophet left
[11:50] the calling out of the church
[11:53] and getting it together
[11:55] for the rapture
[11:57] so you see what i'm talking about i
[11:58] can't understand the people sloping
[12:00] around do you know you've been called
[12:02] out for the rapture
[12:04] [Applause]
[12:06] people can't come sunday at night they
[12:07] can't pray they can't do nothing amen
[12:09] they call for the rapture
[12:11] praise god
[12:13] people can't worship two nights a month
[12:15] without going to sleep amen you call for
[12:17] the rapture
[12:18] [Music]
[12:19] that's the age that we live in we are
[12:21] now living to my honest opinion that's
[12:24] exactly the truth
[12:25] now friends listen
[12:27] you can be a page 11 and you can be ever
[12:30] so sincere
[12:32] but until we know what we're doing
[12:35] how many know what you're doing here are
[12:36] you in the world are you here or are you
[12:38] going in the rapture or you're in the
[12:40] bride or do you know what you're doing
[12:41] do you know why you're coming here
[12:45] are you just coming to church or do you
[12:47] really want to be in the brain
[12:51] amen babysitter thank you
[12:54] until we know what we're doing
[12:56] you're only fighting at the air
[13:00] come back into the word of god and get
[13:02] lined up and then
[13:04] go then you know like a soldier
[13:08] a soldier don't know what to do until he
[13:10] gets his orders to do it
[13:12] we must be christian soldiers
[13:16] and get orders to do it
[13:18] get orders from the bible for this hour
[13:21] now
[13:22] that's why i was saying the scripture
[13:24] says the scripture says
[13:26] i was giving you orders
[13:29] as one of your commanding officers
[13:31] praise god
[13:32] i was lining up with the word of god
[13:36] fivefold ministry praise god
[13:38] [Applause]
[13:40] may be seated
[13:41] amen we get oils from the bible for this
[13:43] hour now
[13:45] not the charge yesterday the charge the
[13:47] day before but the charge today
[13:50] seven thunders give faint charge
[13:56] come out of the world charge
[14:01] amen
[14:02] kind of low on that one amen praise god
[14:05] amen but the charge today
[14:08] which way we go
[14:10] find out the hour that we're living in
[14:12] [Music]
[14:13] and these modern events
[14:15] they're coming by and it's slipping by
[14:17] us too swiftly
[14:19] don't let the persian gulf war settle
[14:21] you back now and thanks it just it was
[14:23] supposed to bring you up
[14:25] and stay out
[14:27] not it already is over in his past it
[14:29] didn't pass it's here it's a modern
[14:31] event
[14:33] made clear by vindicated prophecy
[14:35] [Music]
[14:37] and i might say this hey i received a
[14:38] phone call from belgium last night
[14:40] brother guido and he was telling me in
[14:42] the dutch newspaper february 2nd said
[14:45] that turkey because the euphrates river
[14:47] comes out of there and it splits and
[14:49] goes into syria and also iraq
[14:52] and that uh it's supposed to be doing it
[14:54] now that's what he said in the dutch
[14:55] paper that turkey is now with a big
[14:58] project building a dam to dam up the
[15:01] euphrates river because they need more
[15:03] water in their damn name for their power
[15:06] then that would dry up the euphrates
[15:08] river
[15:09] [Applause]
[15:11] a little natural sign perhaps amen
[15:15] so maybe the the natural people when
[15:17] they see the river dry maybe they
[15:19] believe
[15:20] [Applause]
[15:22] it's already been spoken and written in
[15:24] the magazine and so forth but the others
[15:26] still don't get it
[15:29] amen
[15:30] maybe they might have to take a flight
[15:31] over there and see it
[15:33] now i believe like thomas until i see
[15:36] the euphrates river dried up and walk in
[15:38] the mud i will not believe
[15:41] it
[15:44] i mean will it be that violent i mean uh
[15:47] praise god maybe seated
[15:50] i believe minds is blown out now huh
[15:53] euphrates river drying i thought that
[15:55] message was back then february somewhere
[15:57] amen see and these mind events are
[15:59] slipping by us too swiftly and one day
[16:01] we're going to find out that we'll be
[16:02] left behind without nothing and be
[16:05] caught sealed into the market of beasts
[16:07] before we know it
[16:09] yes sir but what's the mark of the beast
[16:11] unbelief
[16:13] [Applause]
[16:14] i thought it was a a press to go in your
[16:17] head no it's unbelief
[16:19] when you when you refuse all these
[16:21] mysteries and so forth don't believe in
[16:22] getting the holy ghost and
[16:23] sanctification all these things here you
[16:25] already took the market abuse
[16:27] you're just waiting that's all
[16:29] for the see other words we're waiting
[16:31] for the seven seals to manifest us
[16:33] and those the foolish virgins are
[16:34] waiting for the tribulation period to
[16:36] manifest them
[16:40] one of the other you can't hang in
[16:41] between
[16:43] oh sure
[16:46] brother amen
[16:49] sealed and now
[16:50] now and with patience we have to wait
[16:53] for this
[16:54] uh for the prophecies that's promised
[16:56] see that's what i'm preaching the
[16:58] prophecies
[16:59] every one that must be fulfilled in in
[17:01] its age
[17:03] for it foretells us the author has done
[17:06] has before done this and we will wait to
[17:09] see him do it again what a time it is
[17:11] that we're living in something like a
[17:12] calendar you look at the calendar to
[17:14] find out what uh day of the year you're
[17:16] living in and you look at god's bible to
[17:19] see or what age we're living in now

[18:40] sealed back there with seven seals
[18:42] now no one knows what they are
[18:45] but it said in the days
[18:47] of the seventh angel sounding forth his
[18:49] message that's earthly angel now

[20:08] swore
[20:09] by him to live forever and ever that
[20:11] time should be no more

[20:28] his message his prophet sign of the day

[20:36] everybody knows the bible says that
[20:38] when he would finish them six seals
[20:40] and then he strike that seventh seal
[20:43] then take the seven thumbs from the
[20:45] backside and slide them into the bible

[47:45] out to the people
[47:46] just let me just read it again it sounds
[47:49] so good to me i like to read it i
[47:51] thought another mighty angel come down
[47:52] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[47:54] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[47:56] was as the word of sun and his feet as
[47:58] pills of fire

[48:03] messenger to the age to the church he is
[48:06] called a pill of fire the angel of the
[48:08] covenant so forth and he had his hand a
[48:10] little book open
[48:11] now the seals
[48:13] have done been broken here
[48:18] we are breaking them now
[48:21] but in this thing in this the thing is
[48:24] open
[48:25] otherwise he's telling in revelation 5
[48:27] it was closed on the breach
[48:30] but over here now on the first seal he's
[48:32] telling you now we've we're breaking him
[48:35] he was actually breaking the first seal
[48:39] and then when him over top of their
[48:40] heads they know what he's even talking
[48:41] about
[48:42] he was breaking in people beginning to
[48:44] see their names
[48:47] hallelujah
[48:49] see
[48:50] and then then he says revelation 5 the
[48:52] book was closed revelation 10 the book
[48:54] was open

[49:00] thundered seven times
[49:05] what opened the book

[49:10] and he set his right his right foot upon
[49:13] the sea and left foot upon the earth and
[49:15] cried with a loud voice as when a lion
[49:18] roared and when he had cried seven
[49:20] thunders utter their voices that's all
[49:22] that would come out of his mouth
[49:24] christ opened his mouth and cried
[49:28] and when he cried seven thunders
[49:31] come out of his mouth
[49:34] when he was on the earth

[1:17:53] the predestinated one the elected one
[1:17:55] the name
[1:17:56] can never come off from there because it
[1:18:00] was always on it
[1:18:05] don't you understand that
[1:18:07] elohim went
[1:18:09] a thought
[1:18:10] and when he thought
[1:18:13] that christ would die
[1:18:16] immediately in his mind the blood was
[1:18:18] splashed
[1:18:19] [Applause]
[1:18:23] and he saw you
[1:18:24] and the blood was splashed in his mind
[1:18:27] before there was a atom or molecule or
[1:18:30] whatever there was on the earth before

[1:19:14] that must perish that book the name
[1:19:16] comes off but the eternal one
[1:19:18] elected one name can never come off it
[1:19:20] was always on it can never be taken off
[1:19:22] you notice it in the book so we save
[1:19:25] your confusion you'll find that that way
[1:19:27] because i think brother vale who put the
[1:19:29] right grammar to it reminding me of it
[1:19:31] today i said that's right there's only
[1:19:33] one real book of life
[1:19:35] like there was one germ of wheat that
[1:19:38] come through the stalk went through the
[1:19:39] tassel in the husk into the wheat
[1:19:43] all the way along there you say now
[1:19:44] that's the wheat laying there it isn't
[1:19:46] the wheat it's just dark but together
[1:19:48] it's the wheat see it's the wheat
[1:19:50] because it's it's it's all
[1:19:52] one stalk but the wheat is what you're
[1:19:54] talking about the grain at the end of it

[1:25:10] seeds for 25 years message
[1:25:13] and the
[1:25:14] wayside and stony and thorny
[1:25:16] but they had some good ground prepared
[1:25:18] ground that was part of his mind
[1:25:22] and they're the ones that would see
[1:25:24] their names
[1:25:26] and they'll stagger now they're not
[1:25:27] going to back off
[1:25:28] [Applause]
[1:25:29] [Music]
[1:25:33] do you see it see how he does it god god
[1:25:35] can't fail

[1:25:46] [Applause]
[1:25:51] will not do it
[1:25:54] amen here's how you did it
[1:25:56] amen
[1:25:58] praise god
[1:26:00] page 18 you notice no man can come
[1:26:03] except my father draws them first and
[1:26:04] all the fathers give me they will come
[1:26:07] they'll recognize it no other man can do
[1:26:09] it no other person or no matter how good
[1:26:12] who you are it's got to be revealed to
[1:26:15] you then you see who jesus christ is and
[1:26:18] that's your name
[1:26:20] and here's how he prepares you
[1:26:23] now here
[1:26:24] predestinated plan is in plain view just
[1:26:27] as others seek the word of god as a seed
[1:26:30] and must have the ground prepared
[1:26:33] beforehand
[1:26:35] if you sold seed just throw it out there
[1:26:37] on the ground it would do no good the
[1:26:39] berries would pick it up you throw it
[1:26:40] among thistles and thorns it'll choke it
[1:26:42] out pretty soon
[1:26:44] jesus parable said so so the ground has
[1:26:47] to be made ready first so god in solving
[1:26:51] grace prepares the heart first
[1:26:55] he prepared you before the foundation of
[1:26:57] the world to receive him in this age
[1:27:02] and him is the seven seals in all the
[1:27:05] mysteries
[1:27:06] he prepared your heart to receive that
[1:27:08] seed
[1:27:09] [Applause]
[1:27:09] [Music]
[1:27:13] yes
[1:27:15] hallelujah
[1:27:17] to receive him in this age he foreknew
[1:27:20] you by his foreknowledge and ordained
[1:27:22] you to eternal life
[1:27:24] he knew you therefore he prepared you
[1:27:29] and that's who i'm preaching to praise
[1:27:31] god
[1:27:35] and that's the reason you staggered out
[1:27:37] of these things and staggered into what
[1:27:40] you have now it was god leading you to
[1:27:43] the place where he had ordained for you
[1:27:46] to be
[1:27:47] he ordained you to be in new york city
[1:27:49] prayer scott
[1:27:51] no matter how rough and rocky it is
[1:27:53] praise god
[1:27:54] hallelujah he put you there
[1:27:57] amen and you shall be filled
[1:28:00] and you shall be sealed then king jesus
[1:28:03] hallelujah praise god
[1:28:07] if this ground isn't prepared beforehand
[1:28:09] you may be seated it can't grow
[1:28:12] that's the reason the seed of faith when
[1:28:14] you're preaching faith see the
[1:28:16] discernments of the lord and see what
[1:28:17] takes place and all the gifts of the
[1:28:19] bible working and people working and and
[1:28:22] say oh hallelujah i believe it and come
[1:28:25] up and find themselves disappointed
[1:28:28] see the ground has to be foreign
[1:28:31] and you know and you know when it
[1:28:33] strikes it
[1:28:34] [Applause]
[1:28:36] all unbelief see the ground has got to
[1:28:38] be prepared
[1:28:41] hallelujah
[1:28:42] take courage preachers
[1:28:45] oh
[1:28:46] you got it now
[1:28:48] so i'm preaching to what to prepare the
[1:28:49] ground
[1:28:52] i don't expect the others this book of
[1:28:54] life what can i do amen
[1:28:57] they ain't seen their names yet they
[1:28:58] have been transferred over to the
[1:29:00] eternal section by the baptism of the
[1:29:02] holy ghost and fire
[1:29:04] so that's what it is it's all in that
[1:29:06] great revelation there which was made
[1:29:08] known during the time of the seven seals
[1:29:09] preparedness see
[1:29:11] so when you see and then when you do you
[1:29:13] understand it it's a jubilee it's joy
[1:29:15] it's a revelation that causes
[1:29:17] stimulation by the revelation
[1:29:20] and it goes on and on and on because the
[1:29:22] bible said abraham staggered out for 25
[1:29:24] years
[1:29:26] as strong as it went off praise god
[1:29:28] because it's a finished work once you
[1:29:30] have been sealed by the east to seal
[1:29:32] which is the seventh seal mystery of
[1:29:34] god's finished redemptive work
