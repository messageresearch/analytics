removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall relieve that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have any ought against if you have oil against any that your

this little uh time of the lord appearing to his disciples we've been having a wonderful time amen since then came jesus so we want to finish up tonight verse 20 then peter turning about seeing the disciple now he had jesus had just commissioned him peter now he's with the lord seeing the disciple in jesus loved following which also leaned on his breasted supplement said lord which is that which is he that betrayeth thee peter's seeing him sayeth to jesus lord and what shall this man do jesus said unto him if i will that he tarry till he come till i come what is that to thee follow thou me then went this saying abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die yet jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he tarry till i come what is that today this is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true and there are also many other things which jesus did the witcher they should be written everyone i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written amen amen amen [Music] second peter 1 3 according to his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us the glory and virtue whereby given to us exceeding great and precious promises that brother robledo preached on it was as a mountain laying before caleb see it's a mountain of promises amen and laying uh there and uh that you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that's in the world through lust and besides this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge into knowledge temperance to temperance patience to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to broadly kindness charity may god a blessing to reading of his word just a word of prayer our heavenly father we met you when we came in the house of the lord tonight you were certainly here and are certainly here in a mighty way lord god now may you fill me with the holy ghost for service amen lord god that i might preach the word of god tonight and may you feel the believers amen and while i yet speak these words may the holy ghost fall upon some that have need of the holy baptism of the holy ghost and fire and lord may some of the healings be made manifest tonight amen like stephanie colin brenner's was oh praise god now heavenly father remove me out of the way and get glory for thy holy child jesus by stretching forth thy hand tonight praise god to do signs wonders and miracles amen praise god amen bring the deliver the captives father amen open the blinded eyes praise god may signs and wonders follow the message and most of all may every person's soul be set free in here tonight and set them on fire praise god for the will of god in their lives bless the reading of the word bless the hearing of the word and bless the preaching of the word and confirm the word in jesus name we pray and ask the blessed amen and amen you may be seated amen well praise god what can we say feel like old church now like it used to be amen [Applause] so maybe we getting back to that spot amen and brother norman and the title is and to godliness brotherly kindness my subject is forgiveness and just recapping wednesday night those you were here follow me was the message and the holy spirit kind of struck on the young people and i kept saying rock groups i i wasn't meaning that i was meaning just christian rock groups that's what i was trying to get at amy bryant or whoever they are amy somebody and mariah and all these different people and all these ungodly worldly uh so-called christian singing groups singing christian songs so if you have discernment you will discern right away what kind of spirit is on the tape and what kind of spirit is singing with no life and you wouldn't even want it in your car you wouldn't even want it in your home you wouldn't even want to touch it realizing that they put them a record in a circle and a demon demonizes them and say go and sell and then you scoop it up praise god having no discernment of the holy ghost well we don't want that in this church we don't want no jump beaten and contemporary and whatever it is amen so it's finished and you parents getting out of your house amen that's what i was speaking about wednesday night you may be seated amen now there's three conditions for perfect faith number one a spirit of forgiveness number two a revelation that god is the word and the word is god and number three um you must be able to identify yourself in the word so you know since you're hanging around here all these years and can't find yourself in the scriptures for today and you can point to the bibles i'm a written epistle for this day amen are we just a church member amen so now our faith is based on forgiveness amen and then reading and so we just have an old-fashioned time like we had wednesday amen everybody's open praise god anything can happen tonight amen [Applause] praise god on perfect faith page four and i just speaking about it i just read the scripture to you i want to back up here again on verse 25 and 26 and uh and when you stand praying and after having this faith to speak to the mountain then you stand up and pray when you stand praying forgive if you have uh uh ought against any that your father also that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses now this is a very i don't know this i've been saying it over and over and over and it don't get into the people's hearts they you will get nothing if you don't forgive because this is your age and i don't care if you take the skin off here praise god you have to forgive because you have come to that time you have lived out the shuck age where you say anything do anything and god bless you now we in the word now way up in the word hallelujah hallelujah praise god you may forgive you may be seated amen so therefore your father cannot forgive you amen and therefore when you stand praying can't do it amen now faith is based on forgiveness it's the prophet's word now how can you have seven thunder faith if you cannot forgive [Applause] [Music] then how can you be in the seventh under inspiration and don't forgive and hold grudges and arts and all kinds of things in the seven thunders [Music] the prophet of god himself says now faith is based on forgiveness when you come to the lord asking for healing and asking for that the first thing he does is examine you to see if you get any arts in your heart against anybody then your healing is blocked then you're asking for the holy ghost is blocked because the bible says that the love will perhaps love want to do it for you but it can go against his word he doesn't spoke it and so shall it be and the prophet has put it out here today as the day's message if there wouldn't be no prophet to make it seed word for today then it'd just be in the scripture but now it's living moving jumping praise god on tape in book and you can't get away [Applause] oh hallelujah praise god maybe cedar now faith is based on forgiveness and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us that's what we all hunger and it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it we want we we want it such a flow that it will be a help to us and flow out to others remember remember wednesday night it's not for you it's for others [Applause] [Music] god didn't raise you up for yourself he raised you up to use you for others amen and we're speaking about coming to the cross you come to the cross you're born again new breath and there you sit the blood dripping down over you identifying yourself with jesus christ then you're filled with the holy ghost you go up on the cross and hang on the cross and there you begin to be identified like him and virtue in knowledge and temperance and patience and godlings and brotherly kindness and then when you can die out with that sixth virtue godliness then it's time for you to step off the cross you're number seven now praise god and now you're gonna pick up the cross and put it on your back and put your footprints in the blood of jesus christ that's the message oh hallelujah praise god you may be seated amen so we see now faith is based on forgiveness so there is your spirit of forgiveness being your very foundation to begin to have perfect faith and seven thunders gives perfect faith [Applause] amen and number two revelation that god is the word and the word is god amen and on page 11 speaking on perfect faith here paragraph 63. brother brown's saying here i don't know the mechanics of the holy ghost i don't i know it fell on me i can't tell the mechanics of it and 25 years people expect you to explain perfection explain the prophet explain this here anything that you can explain there's no more faith so i'm preaching faith because i cannot explain faith if the prophet said get rid of tv i cannot explain tv i cannot explain about the tuner that's in the vcr i'm not going to explain the mechanics of it prophet said get it out so why come to the minister to explain that explain what do what he said hallelujah faith faith amen see why why you don't get nothing you want explanation people want to explain after you've got the books and tapes explain me explain what you speak it and a revelation takes place and you do it yourself then you're not following brother coleman you're following the message hallelujah [Applause] lauren amen so there we are i don't care about it i don't care about the mechanics i i care to to know about is the blessings of the holy ghost the mechanics he works that that's his secret amen this boy could not be healed that was a boy in saint matthew 17 when they came off the mountain the nine disciples was down there and the other three were up on the mountain the disciples had power jesus gave them power to heal all manner of sickness and cast out devils and cleanse the lepers and raise the dead he gave them power but they didn't have faith to operate the power that they had why didn't they have faith when they hadn't received the holy ghost yet the holy ghost is the one that gives the faith but they had the word the power without the holy ghost and there's people in the message today for 25 years that have the power but no faith to operate the power [Applause] they need the baptism of the holy ghost to operate that [Music] [Applause] yes sir and then they went up on the uh up on the up in the upper room and there did they receive faith to ignite the power that he had already given him amen so they didn't have faith to operate the power that they had and then they questioned jesus said now why couldn't we do it now remember or why they have to do this and why and this and that see without the holy ghost a question now remember they had the word and the word was fleshed in and the word told them i give you power you have the word now and the word tells you i give you power [Applause] you have the word direct from the prophet's mouth for this season that's god speaking through the prophet no questions hallelujah glory to god anna they had the word the word was fleshed in and the word told them i give you power amen i give you power and they had the power but they didn't have faith to operate the word that was in them amen what i mean see what it means jesus had he was the word and he had faith that what he said would happen he said oh bring him here how long will i suffer you yes siree how long do i have to do this here see he had faith with his power how did he he said i can do nothing in myself why he relied on upon what he was now can you rely on what you're supposed to be [Music] now there's a reason why you cannot amen amen he relied on what he was he relied in knowing that he was the word and he had faith in god who made him the word [Applause] revelation that god is the word in the word is god number two amen he's showing you the wing he was god the word and they was in him and that gave him faith because watch he understood his position he knew who he was he knew what he'd come here for and knew nothing could stop it praise god but what about you what are you here for nothing can stop you for the purpose all the trials and circumstances and in the natural cannot stop something spiritual praise god that's going to happen that god done spoken before the foundation of the world praise god is going to happen [Applause] hallelujah yes sir amen you may be seated they give him faith he understood his position he knows who he is and maybe if god will speak to you or a jacob grace joseph affection you'll know who you are [Applause] it won't matter be 1964. ain't nobody gonna stop it ain't no woman no man no medicine nobody sickness disease nothing praise god you're standing in your lot on june 7 1991 preaching the same thing praise god with the same power hallelujah praise god who's going to stop him let him come forth praise god can't nobody to stop it but the nonsensical nonsense praise god amen hallelujah so be it you may be seated he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scripture had said he was this and here every scripture tied in to prove that it was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was oh hallelujah if the church could only know who they are but they're piling paddling around with all nonsense and down depression and what they don't know who they are they don't have the faith to know who they are therefore he run he rely upon what god had made him when you fall into these things you rely i am the pride get back satan praise god i am manifested for this day to destroy the works of the devil to tear down the kingdom of satan to rip out his music and all the tramps he set for the young people praise god to rip them things out of there hallelujah praise god amen you may be seated and if he did that then why can't we rely on what god made us as believers these signs shall follow them that believe he had faith in what he was and if you are a believer you have faith in what you are i am joseph perfection [Applause] i don't know what you are but that's what i am because he told me so praise god then i'm relying on it i'm preaching on it i'm trying to live like it because that's what i am hallelujah praise god you better begin to act like it that's what it is for this day that's the word for this day yes sir give me my mountain praise god hallelujah may be seated if you are a believer you have faith in what you are you are a believer if you got faith in god the bible says over here if our hearts condemn us then we then we can't have faith and that's the problem but if our hearts don't condemn us then we have faith we have confidence towards god if you want to read that the saint john 3 21 got the scripture if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence towards god we don't feel like this and hiding and whatnot we come boldly to the throne of grace past the ribbon veil praise god knowing that he died for us knowing that we make mistakes but knowing that the blood will be there praise god that's faith [Applause] yes sir not wish you washing make one mistake and fall apieces don't come to church backslide go winding around somewhere praise god what kind of christian is that you make a mistake repent and come back to god come back to god hallelujah maybe seated praise god amen but as long as you're doing things that's wrong it there you are you can't have confidence towards god if i'm preaching one thing in a pulpit and reading scriptures and quotes and things and you're doing something contrary where you come sneaking in here then you ain't got no faith you have you you because you don't have no confidence well then why are you doing these things don't you know who you are you're not supposed to be doing those things you're supposed to die to it glory to god so you can see you'll automatically know that you're wrong you ought a man who you put yourself back to your sinner by knowing that you're wrong but when your heart don't condemn you and you know you are a believer and there's nothing between you and god nothing between you and god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god yes sir nothing between you and god you can ask what you will and know that it will be given because it's the word that's given to you just like it was to those disciples and the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are and jesus had faith in the word of god that he what he was is written of me i am that i am amen and he knew that would with that perfect faith see perfect faith in the holy spirit and there he had the hope the fullness of it which was perfect that he was the anointed messiah he had such so much faith he could pick up any scripture that pertain to him and make it manifest make it come to pass yes sir he was anointed maybe seated knowing the messiah that the spirit of god was upon him he said now i i and myself do nothing but it's my faith in god and god was in him and here we are in ourselves mechanics and we're waiting in here now and then and the spirit of god is beginning to move in here now amen that's the spirit of god that will come upon you praise god and then you'll feel it like samson [Music] once more law hallelujah that's what i'm talking about the spirit of the lord will come upon you amen now in myself i do nothing but it's my faith in god in your faith in the anointing amen the pentecostal had faith in the anointing speaking in tongues and so forth they could go right into that thing amen and prophesying and western they had faith in their anointing and so did luther they had faith in the anointing what about our day faith in our anointing dynamics of your mechanics was my faith in god and god was in him the word made manifest and when the word of god comes in you it's made manifest now watch as you are a believer see and a believer watch is the faith of god that moves in you now the word is a believer [Applause] and that is the faith that moves through you do you get it 1964 the word came into me as joseph perfection and that's what moved me that's what kept me all these years that was the faith then come seven thunders that moved me amen that's why i don't care what anybody says but i'll plow into that thing and knock it down hallelujah you may be seated did you get it the believer for this day the believer is the faith of god you got it that's it okay then praise god so now believe is the faith of god it moves in you you must now number three you must be able to identify yourself in the word find your position luther wesley pentecostals and now the word brian if you are the word bride then you better start taking the word like dropping the arts forgiveness and these kind that's the word if you don't do it how can you be the word bride you're back in pentecost somewhere [Applause] simple as that that's the word amen praise don't have no fear in here tonight there's some here kind of living a little bit low and they're sitting there kind of sad just repent in the seat and fire will strike you and you will become a believer a believer believer not a make-believer [Music] amen you may be seated page 13 now the identification of a scripture christian these words said jesus these signs shall follow them that believe now how can you call yourself a believer of people and deny those words how can you call yourself a believer and deny any of this word see you can't do it you're not a believer therefore science can't follow you because you just accept what you want to believe and let the let the rest of it go you you don't believe it but you got to take the whole thing and believe it and when you truly believe not make believe but really believe then these signs shall fall down that belief and we're on the verge of it right now these last two meetings praise god hallelujah amen is moving in slow then came jesus hallelujah ruth amen praise god to know him from the beginning amen the trumpet of the jubilee praise god come and die hallelujah praise god here is in you oh love is not me it's moving up moving up moving up oh now therefore give me my mountain hallelujah praise god follow me amen see it's moving up may be seated amen oh could you compare a christian today with them christians of long ago how their disciples walked in the power of the spirit moved by the holy ghost to it just a prisoner as a priest the other night a prisoner to the word and will of god he couldn't even move until god moved him wouldn't you like to see a church rise like that amen it's going it's going to going back it's got to come that's right it's on the road now it's on the road we're traveling on the right road hallelujah abide in me and my words are part in you shall ask what you will yes sir page 16 jesus had perfect faith he had it and he come because he was the word now i'ma show you when we add from faith all the way to brotherly kindness we become the word we become the word that's what i'm doing oh hallelujah praise god jesus was the word and that's what that's the word for this day and when we add these virtues we come we have seven of them praise god then charity comes upon it my god then if you're safe to this mountain see if you abide in me my words are buying you this word abinds in you then ask what you will it'll be done for you if you say to the mountain be moving don't doubt but believe what you said then you shall have what you ask and ask for you shall have it it'll be given in you time space nothing else will ever change it it's got to happen it's been spoken yes amen glory nothing else will ever change it you know it's done it's already it's already over with now watch now he said if you abide in me my word in you saint johnny you can ask what you will it'll be done then recognize your position in the scripture as a believer see you got to recognize your position as he recognized his position [Applause] so there we are so we see saint john 15 here you buy me my words are buying you then recognize your position in the scripture as a believer so you got to recognize your position as he recognized his position for perfect faith oh hallelujah praise god when you do this then you are ready for the fire of charity to fall on you for the third phase to begin in the pride amen now right in the very hour of no brotherly love in the message there will come forth a bride with the seventh age requirement added to her godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness [Applause] notice let's strike this seventh thunder amen now the bride receives a revelation of honey amen she receives it just a two or three quotes here just to nail it down for you praise god amen blasphemous names page 15. now peter said first faith now watch it real close now we're going to teach this for a few minutes faith now is your first and add to your faith virtue to your virtue knowledge to your knowledge temperance to your temperance why do i keep saying this huh because you don't know it yet you think you heard this before you heard it with your ear you didn't hear it in the heart because if you did this place would be on fire charity would be all over this place so therefore i'm here to remind you of the things the prophet said i just picked up spirits i heard it before you didn't hear that before because you're still in your same condition if you had heard it you you would act upon it hallelujah you said give me that book hallelujah and fire will come into you praise god so now you sit down and you hear it again [Applause] amen i'm commissioned to pour the virtues into you hallelujah you may be seated faith is your first add to your faith virtue to your virtue of knowledge to your knowledge temperance to your temperance patience how many times did you hear brother brown speak on abraham and the 10. how many books well how many times will you hear me speak on the 7th virtue that's my message hallelujah glory to god [Applause] to your knowledge temperance to your temperance patience to your patients godliness to your godliness brotherly love brotherly kinds and then love and anyone knows that love is god and god is love yes siree page 16. now these things i just spoke about now watch it here's why i know you don't know it and these things here absolutely absolutely must be in the christian before the holy ghost ever seals them that's why i know you don't know it because you have been sealed with charity a long time ago if you knew it understood it so you pray for it lord therefore give me my mountain lord add to my faith virtue and knowledge and temperance and so forth that's your prayer praise god you got it now that's what i'm doing to get these things in you so charity can come upon you amen glory do you see it now now these things must absolutely be in the christian before the holy ghost ever seals them before this comes down down on top and makes a complete unit page 19 praise god now the honey and sent the shepherd's dream represented brotherly love brotherly kindness which is this age i just got through telling you see a brotherly currentness the age that we live in now [Music] that's where we're living right now brotherly love brotherly kindness forgiveness and all these things here amen the rock box confession of honey and that's when the in the workman takes this big bucket of water and dumps it into your rock box all kind of trash and everything comes balling out of there now that is your confession that you love the lord and you're a christian but yet the holy spirit brings out trash and all kind of cook and everything else out of your rock box confession hallelujah praise god and then he dumps in the honey and the honey looks like it's not going to stick but it sticks so maybe it'll stick tonight and you say i'm sorry forgive me i have nothing against you oh that's when it sticks [Music] [Applause] amen the 100 representing brotherly love which is this age amen i just got through telling you brother kindness the age oh go to that mighty angel in revelation 10 8-11 say give me this little book that i might be identified in the seventh age for giving my brother no hearts and dropping them all [Applause] there's your forgiveness amen remember the secret laid in the seventh step where the prophet's paraben message the statue of a perfect man brings you into charity the presence of the king oh hallelujah praise god amen page 23 statue of a perfect man now you know about beating out the goal you keep beating the goal until you see a reflection of yourself in the natural page 23 that's the way god does he takes the gold that he has found in the earth and he beats it by the holy spirit turn it over and over and over and beaten until he can see his reflection and that's what we're supposed to do reflect the son of god and now we're supposed to do his work saint john 14 12. you're beginning to reflect the works of god but so many of us try to do the works of christ before the reflection of christ is in us now there's a trouble we find these things happening you know it i know it we see these stumbles along the road we find the scrap heaps of ministers of christians piled along the road it is because they didn't go into it right last 25 years all piled up along the road amen praise god can you imagine because they didn't go into it right amen but i'm making sure here you're going to go into it right amen and the way you go into it amen is is to add these christian virtues faith to godliness then take that mighty giant seventh step because i preached wednesday on that sixth step which is the number of man and you can't go no further than that because seven is god's dimension you can't even go into god's dimension now amen because now number six like i was saying or you could have temperance amen you can have a little knowledge and have a little temperance and don't get me don't do things with people and mind your business and keep your hands to yourself little temperance amen have a little patience and don't get upset because somebody talk against you but but what about godliness to be like jesus that's number six that kills that man death to self number six [Applause] amen you gotta die you can't even get the belly kindness and brother kindness is only a manifestation of the father's goodness and kindness to the world and he comes into you and goes through the world walking in you and loving and forgiving and dropping notes and things that ain't you that's god amen so praise god page 45 now remember the blackberry with peacock feathers uh don't forget so you don't try to add until you actually born again because it won't work you can't make it work it'll come to this or this it'll crumble somewhere and when you get down here to the genuine born again dove then you don't add nothing it adds to you comes on up amen all right coming into perfection now all right then sixthly and uh brotherly love brotherly kindness that's a good one right here is the sixth one seven all right adam burlings all right when we get to that bully kindness put yourself in his place on the matter now you say my brother sinned against me said peter shall i forgive him he said seven times a day he said seven times seven see brotherly kindness see you see what it's about here brother kind is all about forgiveness and christ is the one who forgives that's how you know whether the person got christ in them they don't hold grudges in things they don't say speak mean to me or he busted me that person ain't got christ that's their flesh that's hurt and they want a pound of flesh yes sir amen i have this iron man i know what they did what they're looking for praise god oh my huh kind of open up huh praise god they get mad yes sir and get mad at me look at me strange when i stand back there i'd look right at him i'd listen woman oh man i preached a word to you going about your business praise god go on down the stairs mad and evil going out standing outside there i come to the door and look out there and wave amen they're still looking at me does he know what he said i know what i said amen he told me to say it amen i know exactly what i said i meant to say it to free you praise god glory amen okay put yourself in the matter my brother sinned against me said peter shall i forgive him seven times a day he says 70 times seven see brotherly kindness now you see if a brother of all out of tune don't be impatient with him no be kind to him go anyhow see now uh uh you know no black uh bird feathers with peacock feathers amen be born again first faith with brotherly kind and then you can go to lord sheep now watch in the message now with all their interpretations it's out there said every kind of thing they want to say against the thunders against everything else and then god turns around and sends you out to them and you really got to have the goods because you have tapes where they spoke against you you know exactly what they said here you come walking like jesus a written epistle oh a thundering life [Applause] glory to god amen so let god let them sit in the interpretation for a ministry for the bride to go free them and and help them to bring it up to date now he says here's brotherly kindness somebody said now i'm gonna go how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the assemblies of god you know jesus name and so forth you know and go to to three god people and the oneness and all the rest of the the places brotherly kindness hoping someday patience with him temperance enduring with him knowledge to understand what he believes the other way what spirit is moving in him god bless you brother hey you can see uh some kind of a strange spirit and you look at him well how are you brother he's looking at you and you just how are you god bless you now he's saying i don't you know that i talked about you and i'm saying back you know sure i do but i love you i forgive you for saying it amen see that that's what goes on in the spirit world you know [Music] then you overpower that spirit that spirit goes with confused i said come here brother give me a hug praise god praise i'm your brother amen i'm not the pope what's wrong with you amen praise god and these are your

you see you see you can't tell them that's right now is that is that true and you can't place the church see the church is supposed to be predestinated until the adoption of children where a man god can take a man and adopt him to the family and give him something that first try that and see if it's right 25 years amen and and then try and see if it's right if it's all right move with it [Music]

hair will grow down faces will be washed cigars will be missing that's right when the church begins to get into this mighty power when they have anonymizes to find a few of them yes sir you'll see when that holy holy church stands together in its power positionally placed as sons of god adopted into the family of god powerful church standing in his glory oh that's what he's coming for oh my that's what he's coming for church yes siree amen now saint john if you want to open your bible up saint john 21 i'm going to strike it here now and get ready to close out here shortly amen praise god i wanna i got it took me 17 years to come back around to this here i want to finish it amen verse 20 then peter turning about see it the disciple whom jesus loved following which also lean on his breast itself and said lord which is he that betrayeth thee peter seeing him say it to jesus lord what shall this man do in other words ephraim said lord what shall manasses do praise god so now peter had the instructions from jesus in verse 18 and 19 follow me now peter felt great he felt good he had heard from god he's walking with jesus he's number number one amen and now he wanted now he wants to know i know what i'm doing now here come this man jumping right now lord what's he supposed to do because you and i together lord you know what is he one yes sir why is he following us amen see now he want to know what was john supposed to do and then peter knows john following with that without the same invitation that he had jesus told peter follow me he didn't tell john to follow him john just tagged alone [Music] amen see so peter said what shall this man do 22nd verse jesus said unto him if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee follow thou me so jesus rebuked his curiosity by stating that if it was his will that he lived to his second coming that was none of peter's concern and what i'm doing and what the prophet ordained me to do is none of these menace is concerned i'm in my church i'm in my place i'm ordained to be here there's no woman's concern and she ain't got nothing to say about it and that's why i don't even listen to them praise god i don't care what they say amen because it's none of the concern hallelujah what is that today follow thou me praise god you may be seated it was enough for him to be concerned about doing god's will in his own life let alone uh worrying about what is john's supposed to be doing jesus said what is that to thee follow thou me jesus words however were readily misconstrued as an assurance that john would live on until the lord's return the if he said what if was easily forgotten john himself corrects this false impression in verse 23 then went this saying abroad among the brethren that the disciples should not die yet jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee and that's where all the troubles and the messages at they misconstrue what the prophet said and a couple of all kind of crazy things praise god i wanted the same thing to happen in this age amen even in the churches people say things and misconstrue it and get mad and almost shake somebody's hand all like is here it wasn't even spoken that way see saying going abroad about many things in the message 1967 there was a binding spirit coming the message to stop the ministers from preaching and forming a denomination in the message and i was getting a haircut one day over in the bronx there in manhattan somewhere and i knew that certain spirit i had to face the people sunday 1967 i was thinking about it and my heart and the holy spirit thundered down into my car said what is that to thee follow thou me and that binding spread broke by the word so i ain't worried no more about what they're talking about amen he said follow down me and i had tried to follow him right on up to the night june 7 1991 despite all the things that they have to say despite all what's been said about by what i preach in my church and my conventions and so forth still what is that today follow thou mean hallelujah praise god you never get to heaven worrying about what they're saying i'll tell you that but you will get to if you do what jesus tell you to do that's right and drop your amen follow thou me and drop your arts and forgive them and follow thou me to the seventh step and i'll meet you there i know because i met him on the seventh step in june 9th and i want to meet him there again hallelujah oh it was wonderful when i met him there we must take this seventh step we cannot flinch back the hour has come to take this step and that's why i'm in this public tonight till you have got to take it praise god amen page 16 the sign of this time new york city amen paragraph 114 uh on the lutheran was the same holy spirit justification sanctification and the wesley the message then the baptism the holy spirit making three three not three steps of grace but three stations i might call it he drops down to paragraph 117. now this last great step must come into the perfection which i preached on wednesday night that the holy spirit has to live in that church so perfectly it'll take the head and the body unite it'll make the head and the body united together see see that's the body he is the head in the body now we find that he promised the last days that that would be done and he's saying that somebody with the holy ghost is going to step out and begin to add these virtues and they're going to hit that sixth one and die then they will have faith to make this last great step up on that seventh step there they will meet charity it's got to be done why because christ must live in this church so perfectly that'll be like husband and wife the same self person [Music] that is the message praise god hallelujah now who's going to do it who's going to dedicate themselves to them praise god you see where we are it must be done praise god amen oh hallelujah now you know what i'm preaching about amen people sitting here looking at me and wondering what am i talking about amen you may be seated do you understand when you get to that seven step with all them virtues flowing through you you can catch the headstone [Applause] yes sir page 17 the feast of trump is speaking about the pyramid the bride and the enoch then he comes on down a skip a lot to save time and now he said go into the prophet's chamber and watch them seven steps or where did the guard meet the challenge to uh bring the comer into the presence of the king at the top of the steps or where did malachi for the guard meet you in the seventh age of brotherly kindness to reveal the mysteries to you and to bring you like esther to the king [Applause] hallelujah praise god if i perish i'll perish but i'm going in by faith i got people i got to save out there there's those in the pride that don't know if i perish i perish but i'm gonna put on the gowns that mordecai told me to to put on i'm gonna dress the way mordecai told me to do it that it would be find favor with the king i'm going to do what malachi 4 told me to do knowing is going to find favor with jesus christ if i'm going on that seventh step [Applause] hallelujah you ready to go in that seven step oh praise god that's where the king is at at the top of the stem you may be seated was in the seventh step there shows that we have got to come again with that same spirit that was on john he introduced the messiah he was greater than all the prophets he introduced him and we got to come to a place again to something that's going to introduce the messiah and how the messiah the people that's believing him know it unless how can they know unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is constantly in that word daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish uh the unwise wouldn't know they shall know their god and now he said it appear in the last days uh it says is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word here's your mate the reveal were all the things he told you what not to do with music and all these things here that's the reveal where then when you accept it you accepting the revealed word when you constantly go against it you're rejecting it and taking the mark of the beast don't even know it you young people praise god hallelujah praise god yes sir the revealed word you may be amen that's why this has has to happen it wasn't reformers was in luther wesleyan and pentecostals in them the scripture says it wasn't but it will come this is his promise for this age oh we lived in an age that his coming will be in she must be identified in him yes yes sir for the 201 and he is the word not the denomination the word we ought to be the children of the light and the light is the word which is made light for this age how do we know light except they come from the word all right the word made flesh is the light of the age when you see it the bible said oh praise god amen so it brings a comma introduce the messiah amen and uh not only in mechanics but also in the dynamics of it a fire baptism charity and christ's bride has to be identified with him for the 201. here's the word the word made flesh amen and soul so and to godliness brotherly kindness on the seventh step to meet the presence of the king and to bring and to brotherly kindness charity did you get it so regardless of what shall come though if the whole church walks out the message is denominated so-called denominated whatever they want to call it because it cannot denominate it uh cursed uh reviled no fellowship what is that do they follow thou me if i have no place to go and it seems like the god won't move in my uh uh daily

the sin and pull them out of the fire hate even the garments by the flesh blemishes and spots so it's adoption time friends seventh step is barely kindness and love descends on the seventh step to take out all the evil oh church what shall this man do what is that to thee follow thou mean thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself take a man to prayer before god before he begin to talk about him
