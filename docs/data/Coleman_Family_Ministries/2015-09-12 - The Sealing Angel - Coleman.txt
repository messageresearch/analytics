abides let the death angel pass oh my it's just like this in in comparing the Seven Seals when God used Martin Luther for the coming out for that first church age when he used John wesler he gradually brought them out and was revealing in them that church age how many understand what I'm saying he revealed in them without them knowing what age they was in but they was acting out God that was in Lu them acting out justification they couldn't help but do that that was an anointing the AR was on that was anointing in them Wesley acted out sanctification the Pentecostal spoke in tongues and prophesy they had to do that then so of I got to come into the headstone amen I'm about my father's business I must come in The Headstone I must speak the word Walk In The Word talk in the word sanctify myself get out of the world what are you doing I'm acting out [Music] Christ I'm expressing him for this age a home age now do you understand why I preach like I preach I had to do that W to

names I going to nail something down here but I think you got it amen see brotherly kindness and the baptism of holy spirit let me strike something here page 16 he said that there was uh all down Through the Ages and they woke up sleeping and well I'll just read this here now these things here absolutely must be in the Christian before the holy ghost ever seals them before this comes down on top and makes a complete unit people got so confused what brother BR was talking about they said well no I'm not I don't have the Holy Ghost yet nobody's got it and a group of of Brothers ran out and said nobody got the Holy Ghost and you know that's the truth absolutely I know the people who would do and where are those people tonight they all messed up in the world everywhere else for teaching that false doctrine that nobody had the faith the baptism of the Holy Ghost they were looking at charity on the top and looking around way back in ' 66 and condemning people for not having the Holy Ghost which when God was all the time adding adding adding adding adding see Amen brother Freddy he knows amen see so then uh seal up I want to strike for those who don't have the Holy Spirit I'm going to show them what he's talking about here page 20 at the end of since the shepherd's dream he's speaking about the the honey sticks talking about the the spirit of God coming down the mountain the Saints are sleeping waiting waiting waiting on to this age but soon here it is now the Holy Ghost being poured out from Christ will come and will seal up the church oh amen then the church will be raptured it'll be a complete un of God a bride for Christ who will be the head of all things you follow me now page 21 so we well we understand you add he says then you add then uh the Holy Ghost comes down I keep striking these words here then the Holy Ghost comes down and seals you as a unit after you've added these things see am as same as he seals the church as a unit the way he makes his bries away makes an individual out of the same material and he goes on page 21 22 and 23 now 22 and 23 and now as in the individuals these ver and things are knowledge and Temperance is added to our faith then when the Capstone comes the Holy Spirit cements it together you getting it now there's the baptism of the Holy Spirit the whole thing all eight things must be in there and we have seven and waiting for the eighth the Holy Spirit to come upon us in the true baptism of the Holy ghost the token oh amen see 21- 23 now there's the baptism of the Holy Spirit now to those of you who don't have the Holy Ghost you're waiting for it I want to bring us to you so you can understand what we're talking about the people with the baptism have the faith know already and they've been adding adding adding adding then there's those here without the Holy Ghost now speaking to you he says now the holy spirit page 23 BL she means or what has come then he will give you Supernatural Faith here it is see spiritual faith that here at the bottom then that spiritual Faith recognizes only the word see what what makes the people different with the Holy Ghost they they don't know what you're talking about you say because you don't understand you understand what this is the word see that see that that angel is in them and that angel is the word so a person with the Holy Ghost they don't know what you're talking about there another world somewh where they bleed everything God said they are the word amen see then that spiritual Faith recognizes only the word then many people without the Holy Ghost think they mean well you mean now something's wrong with you cuz you don't understand after all after all what a person with the Holy Ghost they don't what you're talking about they they're

anybody else says don't do no good that only knows the word if somebody says the days of Miracles pass that Faith only knows the word amen amen somebody said there's no such a thing as the baptism of

seed must come to a manifestation and a possession a harvest of what's inside it must come to a fruit and fruit is Harvest amen and the fruit of the Harvest of the spirit is love peace Joy goodness faith and all these things gentleness and good amen that's the Harvest of the seed amen now we understand adoption and tutoring we're getting ready for it now you're getting ready to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in his fullness like on the day of Pentecost amen but the full word will be here then with the fullness of the word which is here and the Dynamics full of the spirit then as

for itself amen he'll let it be known among men there you are oh how many understand what I'm talking about praise God couple more quotes for you I got one I feel a blast to here I'm going to sign off amen praise God now adoption and tutoring couple the quotes here and you understand it page 24 speaking about the Pentecostal people there's where our Pentecostal people made their mistake being born into the family by the Holy Ghost that's right but then we must be the right kind of children tutored by the right tutor how could the Pentecostal 1906 be in adoption when they had gifts amen so they had to wait till the prophet brought the Holy Spirit the word then call them all out when the last one comes in send down the Holy Ghost position them in the body as Sons and Daughters of God then Apostles prophets pass Evangel and teachers pour the virtues into the body to that Perfection of the coming of the Son of God and in there's gifts amen all people are gifted different things get I don't know what they are everybody get something amen praise God page 25 now when Jesus had been obedient his obedience how many understand what I'm say now after you receive the Holy Ghost for a few days or a couple of months or I don't know how long but by 77 you know what's going to happen don't you so between now the time and you receive the Holy Ghost until you go in Resurrection there will be a tutoring for adoption Behavior amen sanctification set out to adoption amen see obedience to the word see now when Jesus had been obedient Jesus to God God plac him positionally this is him he was born he's my son born in the kingdom of God Amen brother BR was born into the kingdom of God a minister 1946 God positionally placed him but he but he's higher than us so he went out into in 1946 along with all robbers and the rest of them he was the only one that was adopted all the rest of them fail but then he had to go one step higher he had to bring God down his first pole second pole was doing his work in the Kingdom but the third pole was God himself coming down oh see his ministry is higher amen now when members born by here it is by the Holy Ghost into the family of God and has proven to have these virtues in him that I can see it no that God can see virtue God can see knowledge God can see Temperance and patience and blly kindness and godliness in him then God seals him not me I can't seal you so therefore God watches you in your home God watches you on your job in the subway the bust not me I don't see you amen it's God I ain't got nothing to do with it it's not what brother com think is what God thinks and knows and has about you is God between you and God not me your salvation is personal I ain't got one thing to do with your salvation amen see God can see us in him then God seals him or places him and there that's when you see the sons and daughters of God he says uh the church is going to be there page 26 let me say real good so you get it the church is predestinated to be there I want to be with it but the only way I'll be with it is to be part of it how do I become part of it by being in it how do I get in it by baptism by one Spirit 1 Corinthians 12 by one Spirit we all baptized into one body one body baptized into it praise God this is my last message message I I got it home I've been wanting to preach this for months on months on months and finally got it in amen he said here he he said but you can't stick these little things say unspoken tongues you go out here angry and swear and carry on Amen see that's putting in peacock feathers the jbird you can't do it your own life proves is not but when these things are operated In You by God then you're sealed am then there's no put on about it you're just yourself that's when Visions perfect Holy Spirit works of God everything is made manifest because why you and Christ become one you and Christ become one oh there we are friends how many want to become one like that that's what I want praise God so therefore that's it'll testify itself the wedding garments has been put on you amen it was was so 1 Corinthians 13 8-13 the negative in part and KN part and prophesying part somebody speak a prophecy that ain't going to do me no good after it comes to pass I can't dwell on that but when the word comes the perfect word I can dwell in the word every day I can take the same scripture that Luther used and get some more out of it is that right once a prophecy has been spoken JN Jones house going to blow up or something comes to pass that's no more good for me I can't get no more out of that prophecy that was in part but this prophecy that's that's perfect he which is perfect is come then there no more in [Applause] part amen it's the word the lhost the person is his grace friends or I going to read another scripture but I'll just close it out Titus 3 1-5 1-7 read it when you go home said that we're justified by his grace that great sealing Angels once again ready to to project his Divine love to his people that that salv and Grace May set us free in bless us this great sealing Angel my last remarks this great sealing angel I got a quote here I want to finish out the great sealing Angel has been here on the earth since 1946 am how many knows that amen praise God that's when the angel came down to Malachi 4 how many remember that May 7th I believe was 1946 and now in your revelation of Jesus Christ serious those white books the foolish version 144,000 I just was I was hearing this today I got a real blessing I want to pass it on to you amen and close out to give you Faith amen now page 442 if you want to read you go home speaks about a World War I 443 how the war he said in the the decline of the world war he had the volumes on it and Kaiser wilham said he never issued any orders to stop the war nobody knew how to war stopped but God stopped the war because Revelation 7 says he that there come an angel from the East to seal 144,000 and the Four Angels had to hold back the winds the war and strife until Israel be sealed but in there also was some Gentiles you and I that had to be sealed also amen since 194 so God stopped the war himself right when the Holy Spirit fell in 1906 there was a plague in there influenza that right and it killed over 20 million people I believe it was and millions were sick I said brother Bram called it the sixth plague I just drop it off to you what he said I he said it amen see so it fell in there over 20 million people my he knows about he was there yes sir old time knows yes sir so therefore on the page 443 it tells you about the 11th hour and the 11th day and in how about November the 11th 11:00 a.m. 11th month the war will sto amen it will sto mysteriously on page 443 explains the whole thing but I want to bring back a point there page 444 paragraph 100 if you're writing it down now see the angel of the Lord here it is is on earth now amen see he's moving around fixing everything for the coming of the Lord so he come down and when he come down with Malachi 4 for the first pull second pull third pull the other two angels came at the same time Billy Graham and all Roberts amen and those two angels are still here all robers and Billy grah could even on television amen but and the other Angel is still here Malachi 4 himself is gone but the angel is here and the Angel's been here all the time oh praise God he says he's on Earth moving around fixing everything for the coming of the Lord and the coming of the Lord is first Thessalonians 46 16 the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout he got everything ready for the coming then he come out in the shout he's still on the Earth moving across the Earth fixing things getting us ready for the Dynamics to the mechanics he's right here in New York City been here all the time on the angel on the earth praise God amen see and it's the same Angels that's heard the sin when they went out down to S we come down and see if these things be sold can you remember that and one Angels stay down with Abraham and the elected that's the one with us amen doing the sign and Discerning thoughts in the heart see and the two angels went down there and preached them and brought their little bit group out sleeping virgin these Ang this Angel preached down here modern Billy Graham and them pull them out see on page 445 now these great ministers that's covering that world out there after Billy Graham receed the Holy Ghost he could not come into here that's his field down there he recognizes it and God's holding him there so don't look at all around let's look at ourselves cuz God's holding him there but I thank God he a't holding me there amen see that's his feel God's holding there see with that intellectual preaching the thing that he hears here but he's trying here it is he's trying to jerk out of Sodom trying to jerk out or give Grace to that sleeping virgin oh my God Divine love Holy Spirit CH coming down love projects to give grace to the bride to seal her up and then jerk lot out because Billy Graham and all Roberts the two angels couldn't get lot out then God unveiled himself to Li and gave Grace to lot the world was so powerful for lot couldn't get out of there am and he gave a lot of choice escape to the pyramid Mountain but lot's heart wasn't up there give me a little place in the world near the world's order the grace of God all right lot I love you I love you I died for you too when God comes down something good fixing to happen every foolish virsion millions of them will be saved only the seed of the serpent think of the grace of God tonight then how much more is the grace of God to you and me the foolish version of those denominational and those in the message at the message goes PL on top of their heads they're not elected they don't know anything about it but here you sitting here in the Thunders and adoption and you know everything right do you know everything the seal an angel wants to seal you up with the person of Jesus Christ love is fixing to project divine grace will open blinded eyes the cripples will walk by through Grace love love must be there I
