[0:00] [Music]
[0:10] you may be seated for a
[0:11] moment amen is it wonderful to feel the
[0:15] presence of the
[0:17] Lord all right so now next Sunday not
[0:20] next Sunday October 5th will be the Lord
[0:24] supper and now you know we've been
[0:27] phasing into the third phase and trying
[0:30] to do everything that the prophet said
[0:33] and we remember how his third pull come
[0:36] in and how he remodeled the church and
[0:39] all that and we just did what we felt do
[0:41] by inspiration I've been trying to do
[0:44] that since 1982 but never worked out see
[0:47] just seemed to work out in
[0:49] 1986 so perhaps the Lord will work for
[0:51] us at this time like he has been even in
[0:54] a greater way this time and so therefore
[0:58] we'll be setting things in order worship
[1:02] and uh Church order and communion and
[1:05] different things whatever the Lord tells
[1:07] us to do that we will do and sometimes
[1:10] things will be done we won't have a
[1:12] chance to get back to explain why but if
[1:15] you believe in the leadership then
[1:17] you'll move with
[1:19] it amen so the next communion will be
[1:23] October 5th and we'll just do what the
[1:26] Lord tell us to do in that time and
[1:28] season amen and then we feel that the
[1:32] ministry has been uh tested and so forth
[1:35] and you can see what it is amen is god
[1:38] with it or whatever it is uh you you're
[1:41] answer it amen see so be no questions
[1:44] and just have faith in the leadership it
[1:46] can always show you where I am coming
[1:48] from and what I'm doing and why I'm
[1:50] doing it I don't always have time to to
[1:52] to explain it but I can certainly show
[1:54] it to you amen then of course you still
[1:57] got to get a revelation
[2:00] amen even after I do it amen so praise
[2:03] God so then you don't know who's right
[2:05] but one thing we know he's right so
[2:08] anyway now on this third phase just
[2:10] about five minutes or so here I'll read
[2:11] a couple of quotes from Discerning of
[2:13] spirit then um if God give me the
[2:16] strength I want to try to bring a little
[2:19] inspiration then I can be able to rest
[2:21] amen so that's why we got the church
[2:23] here today I couldn't do it on the
[2:25] Lord's Supper because we got to take an
[2:26] hour or so for the taking of the Lord's
[2:28] Supper in the foot wash so I have more
[2:30] time this morning now on discernment of
[2:32] spirit just a few just want to post you
[2:35] and let you know why we do what we're
[2:36] doing and so forth now brother Bram said
[2:39] discernment of spirit knowing surely
[2:41] that in the day of judgment we will be
[2:43] brought face to face with this
[2:45] generation and being ministers we will
[2:47] be judges and and the and the people to
[2:51] which we have spoken to and the attitude
[2:54] towards the word that we bring them will
[2:57] determine their Eternal destination
[3:00] so now you understand why I'm careful to
[3:02] bring what I'm bringing amen because
[3:05] you're being
[3:06] judged you see and then that's why that
[3:10] whole second phase was crying out for
[3:12] Holy decency please don't say nothing if
[3:15] you don't understand it's better to
[3:16] leave but don't sit there and complain
[3:17] and come against it cuz see you were
[3:20] being judged amen praise God see and the
[3:24] people which we have to which we have
[3:26] spoken uh spoken to in their attitude
[3:29] toward the word that we bring them will
[3:31] determine that Eternal destination
[3:33] therefore Lord in that day we would be a
[3:35] judge for or against the generation that
[3:38] we preach
[3:39] to we might leave here this morning so
[3:42] filled with the holy spirit that we
[3:44] would be more determined than ever
[3:46] before in life to carry the message to
[3:50] the dying generation that we're living
[3:52] in you feel that way amen so may God
[3:56] change our understanding this morning
[3:59] and we go go out of here on a third
[4:00] phase new people with a new Purpose with
[4:03] a new hope with a new
[4:06] determination that I'm going to be like
[4:09] Jesus
[4:11] amen so now you may be in a little group
[4:13] somewhere might be 10 or 12 of you maybe
[4:16] in another state somewhere seem like you
[4:18] can't get nothing going and then you
[4:20] just go on with the same old thing over
[4:22] and over and over but if somebody will
[4:24] die and start it then that one will be
[4:27] able to bring Christ to their lips then
[4:30] the next another one will catch you with
[4:31] a new birth and another one until the
[4:33] whole group in your state is all full of
[4:36] the new birth and brotherly kindness and
[4:37] goodness of
[4:39] God but who's going to start it I
[4:41] challenge you to start
[4:43] it am man that's dying to the
[4:47] flesh praise
[4:50] God so we might want to leave here to
[4:53] carry the message to the dying
[4:54] generation that we living in hear us
[4:56] Lord and speak to us through the word we
[4:59] ask in the name of thy son and our
[5:01] Savior Jesus Christ amen so therefore um
[5:06] now the church speaking about I'm going
[5:08] to have to cut some here um the church
[5:11] page five he said the New Testament
[5:14] Prophet is a preacher we all know that
[5:17] just any Minister that's a preacher is a
[5:18] prophet a new testament Prophet not the
[5:20] old if he's prophesying preaching not to
[5:24] try to edify himself to make a big name
[5:27] or edify his organization which he
[5:29] should be in in organization here I am
[5:32] without one brother R speaking telling
[5:35] them now amen but yet preaching you
[5:37] should be that's right now every man
[5:40] ought to have a church home you ought to
[5:42] have a place not just to float about
[5:45] from Pillar To
[5:47] Post now look at the message today I got
[5:51] my tapes I don't need you I got my books
[5:54] and they're floating about from place to
[5:56] place in the message yet and here's what
[5:58] the prophet said you ought to have a
[6:00] place uh that you can go to and you call
[6:04] it your church somewhere you pay your
[6:06] tithe and somewhere that you help
[6:09] support the cause take your choice but
[6:12] then don't never disfellowship the other
[6:14] man because he don't belong with your
[6:18] group discern his
[6:20] Spirit you know if he's preaching
[6:23] something that you don't understand well
[6:25] discern his spirit and say what's he
[6:26] trying to
[6:27] achieve what is the end of his
[6:30] prophecy is something good amen to bring
[6:34] Christ down for adoption and bless
[6:37] everybody is that what he's trying and
[6:39] striv him for discern
[6:41] that discern what that man is saying no
[6:43] matter how he's saying it or what which
[6:47] way he's saying it but what is he
[6:52] saying amen take your choice then don't
[6:55] never dis disfellowship the other man
[6:58] discern his spirit
[7:00] and see if he's got the same purpose in
[7:02] heart then you got Fellowship one with
[7:04] another you're working for one great
[7:06] cause that's the cause of Christ I think
[7:09] that is absolutely
[7:10] true and Page Six paragraph 21 just
[7:14] quickly then we're going to just say and
[7:16] you going to remember these things what
[7:17] I'm saying to you now we're just talking
[7:20] to the church it's not to the outside
[7:21] people see this is to this church here
[7:24] amen just take the minist minister today
[7:27] if he has the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[7:29] and and he knows that if he preaches
[7:31] that word it's going to cut his Fame
[7:34] down he's not going to be so popular if
[7:38] he preaches certain things in brother
[7:40] Brown's
[7:42] message such as the baptism of the Holy
[7:45] Ghost rebuking spirits and seven
[7:47] Thunders and things like that it'll cut
[7:50] his Fame
[7:52] down he may have been very popular in
[7:54] Georgia but when he begins to lay them
[7:57] Thunders out they're going to walk away
[8:01] but what is he trying to
[8:03] achieve what is he looking
[8:05] for sure ain't no Fame in doing that
[8:09] there's no popularity there there's no
[8:10] money
[8:12] there they all walk
[8:14] away amen see he preaches that word is
[8:18] going to cut his Fame down he going to
[8:20] put him in a little bitty church
[8:22] somewhere but if God's with it is going
[8:25] to grow and
[8:27] prosper while they saying is finished

[13:13] have discernment of
[13:15] spirit or the devil will tell you
[13:17] anything see we have discernment of
[13:20] spirit to discern the spirit that's in
[13:22] the man to see if it be the spirit of
[13:25] God or
[13:26] not amen see we notice when he was here
[13:30] on Earth he went about doing good I
[13:32] notice another thing that comes in my
[13:33] mind do you noce when David was rejected
[13:36] as God's uh he went out in the city well
[13:38] I just spoke on that already about
[13:40] mistakes and so forth amen and he's

[13:58] spirit of the devil working now if you
[14:00] notice he was crippled it represents the
[14:03] spiritual of the people today
[14:05] that would make fun of the true spirit
[14:06] of God in Christ manifesting
[14:10] itself
[14:12] see that was the spirit of Christ in
[14:14] David being rejected as a king and today
[14:19] now that's going to mean something today
[14:23] cuz we have a a thought on this
[14:27] amen amen

[14:32] and David being rejected as king and
[14:33] today when the people make fun of the
[14:35] people who has received the Holy Ghost
[14:37] and trying to achieve something to draw
[14:40] Methodist and Pentecost Baptist
[14:41] Pentecostal and Presbyterians all
[14:43] together in unity that was brother

[15:46] in him did did you catch it when you
[15:49] hide it and nobody knows but when you go

[46:04] this church comes here to greatly
[46:06] exhaust some human system or something
[46:08] then its motives is not right we're not
[46:12] here to do that amen but if it's here if
[46:15] it's put here to try to achieve
[46:17] something for the kingdom of God then
[46:19] the motive and the objective both is
[46:23] right if the motives is directed that
[46:25] way amen now I've been thinking since
[46:28] the ministry and the first second and
[46:30] third here now very selom I was speaking
[46:34] to brother musco and a brother had left
[46:36] and he come back he now brother mus I
[46:38] like to see the word phase that I hear
[46:40] all the time and I just happened to run
[46:43] across this quote a brother give it to
[46:44] me overseas for something else and I I
[46:46] had it markk for a long time and I spoke
[46:50] to brother my friend and uh I mentioned
[46:52] a quote he said what is that he said
[46:54] this brother like to see the word phase
[46:56] cuz brother says pull so listen to what
[46:59] the prophet said about
[47:00] faase now I've been thinking since the
[47:03] ministry in the first second third phase
[47:06] of the ministry when I first come to
[47:08] shreport I told you people that the Lord
[47:11] that you would lay your hands like on my
[47:13] hand and it would signify the same and
[47:15] the Holy Spirit never failed one time
[47:17] but what told you exactly what was wrong
[47:19] with you I told you then he told me that
[47:22] day it would be a time when you know the
[47:24] very secret of the heart not knowing
[47:26] that the word says that will be I didn't
[47:28] know that then I didn't know that but
[47:31] the word does say that the word of God
[47:33] is a discerner of the thoughts and the
[47:35] intents of the heart Hebrews 4 now who
[47:38] could understand that God would take
[47:40] Hebrews 4 and give that gift to his
[47:42] prophet in
[47:45] 1946 there's a difference between 1
[47:47] Corinthians 13 Discerning of
[47:50] spirits this goes past the spirit and
[47:53] divides a
[47:55] su goes into the sockets of your
[47:59] souls that's why people get cut up when
[48:01] that word goes in
[48:04] there cuz they can act so much in the
[48:06] human spirit I paid my tith I did this I
[48:09] did that but when that word is preached
[48:11] by the holy ghost man it bypasses your
[48:14] intellectuals and Pops in there and
[48:16] bring out something you didn't think of
[48:18] or you thought you was
[48:22] hiding oh well that's what this church
[48:25] is all about there's a spirit behind
[48:26] this church
[48:34] see the word is opening up here
[48:36] today and all those who were couldn't
[48:39] understand but hell on you're going to
[48:40] understand
[48:44] today praise
[48:46] God excuse me not knowing the word says
[48:49] oh yeah here we are now that the words
[48:52] you see you must never leave that word
[48:53] you must stay exactly with that word the
[48:55] way it's written don't put no private
[48:58] interpretation to that just say it just
[49:00] the way it's written that's God's word
[49:02] if it says you repent and be baptized
[49:05] don't talking about you got the Holy
[49:06] Ghost when you believe
[49:08] it that's
[49:09] foolishness amen just say what it says
[49:13] amen just say the way it's written
[49:15] that's God's word that's God's heart
[49:17] that's God and God and His word is the
[49:19] same as I said last night that there's a
[49:21] portion uh laid to every age and there's
[49:23] something anointing comes down to
[49:25] project that portion word for that age

[49:34] the church and we got to meet him in the
[49:37] air now these things has got to come to
[49:39] pass in this day just as he promised he
[49:41] would do it now for about five years

[49:47] about that second phase see each one of
[49:49] those phases had served his time and he
[49:53] give visions and many of tape listeners

[1:10:55] Discerning of spirits of Prophecy first
[1:10:59] pull the healing of the sick the second
[1:11:03] was the prophecy that went forth that

[1:11:27] the ministry of Jesus
[1:11:29] Christ then if it's the ministry of

[1:11:33] somewhere on this Earth of three pools
[1:11:35] or three
[1:11:39] phases amen discern it
[1:11:42] now not the man but discern the spirit
[1:11:46] that's making these three
[1:11:49] phases then you know those people railed
[1:11:52] against Christ and not the man
[1:11:56] yes Glory so you're going to understand
[1:12:00] today cuz when you come in at church you

[1:12:24] him is that right when he went forth
[1:12:27] Healing The Sick everybody want him in
[1:12:28] that church but one day he turned around
[1:12:30] and started prophesying for he was the
[1:12:32] word he was the prophet that Moses spoke
[1:12:35] of oh my the dead was raised two or
[1:12:39] three times and old the Revelation was

[1:12:47] something here 1964 1974 first pull or
[1:12:51] first phase and dead raise in front of
[1:12:54] everybody

[1:13:09] male the
[1:13:12] Epistles praise God so you have to
[1:13:17] understand and then you can be
[1:13:20] blessed that's why I say it's not to any
[1:13:23] Outsider it's to this church
[1:13:27] any outside of say anything about this
[1:13:28] here and God just pack him out of here
[1:13:30] if he don't know what he's talking

[1:13:37] around here amen praise God this is
[1:13:40] serious things there being spoken amen
[1:13:43] it's no Bragging nothing like that but
[1:13:46] see now that was fine raising the dead
[1:13:48] and Healing The Sick and Cancers and

[1:14:57] them how they were living the things
[1:14:59] where they were doing he become very
[1:15:01] unpopular that was his second

[1:15:21] people condemned people that could never
[1:15:22] be saved because they were condemned be
[1:15:25] for like Judas is
[1:15:27] carried so those spirits that was there
[1:15:30] and curs Christ comes back and curse
[1:15:33] Christ in the prophet and will come back
[1:15:36] on any holy ghost man who will stand and
[1:15:39] those same demons will come back and
[1:15:42] anoint people today and say perverse

[1:17:21] imagine a bullhead telling I don't like
[1:17:22] the way you said that

[1:19:39] second phase it wasn't a man was mean
[1:19:41] but the second pH from Christ to the

[1:21:27] the ark and when he went into the ark
[1:21:30] there was seven days that nothing
[1:21:32] happened now watch his testimony
[1:21:35] preached to the
[1:21:37] Doom amen see so shall it be like it was

[1:22:03] family was in Come Thou and the family
[1:22:05] in the ark he shut that door and that
[1:22:08] Ark sat there for seven days to

[1:22:19] laughing because you're sealed
[1:22:21] in for seven days with seven Thunders
[1:22:25] with seven virtues
