[0:01] so now let us um turn to the word of the
[0:03] Lord I want to get along with the
[0:06] message tonight and I want to read from
[0:09] St John the 5th
[0:10] chapter uh verse
[0:12] 1-20 and St John the 14th chapter verse
[0:16] 12 shall we stand for the reading of the
[0:20] word I'm reading from St John the 5th
[0:24] chapter after this there was a great
[0:26] feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to
[0:30] Jerusalem now there is at Jerusalem by
[0:32] the Sheep Market pool by the Sheep
[0:35] Market a pool which is called in the
[0:39] Hebrew tongue
[0:42] Betha having five porches in these lay a
[0:45] great multitude of impotent folk a blind
[0:48] halt withered waiting for the moving of
[0:50] the of the water for an angel went down
[0:53] at a certain season into the pool and
[0:55] Trouble the water and whosoever then
[0:57] first after the troubling of the water
[1:00] stepped in was made whole of whatsoever
[1:02] disease he had and a certain man was
[1:05] there which had an infirmity 3 and8
[1:08] years when Jesus saw him lie and knew
[1:12] that he had been now a long time in that
[1:14] case he saith unto him wilt thou be made
[1:17] whole the impotent man answered him sir
[1:20] I have no man when the water is troubled
[1:23] to put me into the pool but while I am
[1:25] coming another steth down before me
[1:29] Jesus saith unto him him rise take up
[1:31] thy bed and walk and immediately the man
[1:33] was made whole and took up his bed and
[1:35] walked and on the same day was the
[1:38] Sabbath the Jews therefore said unto him
[1:42] that was cured it is the Sabbath day it
[1:45] is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed
[1:48] he answered them he that made me whole
[1:50] the same said unto me take up thy bed
[1:52] and walk then asked they him what man is
[1:57] that which saith unto thee take up thy
[2:00] bed and walk and he that was healed with
[2:03] not who it was May I strike it again uh
[2:08] and he that was healed wi not who it was
[2:11] he didn't know who it was for Jesus had
[2:14] conveyed himself away a multitude being
[2:17] in that place afterward Jesus findeth
[2:20] him in the temple and said unto him
[2:22] behold Thou Art made whole sin no more l
[2:26] a worse thing come unto thee the man
[2:29] Departed and told the Jews that it was
[2:31] Jesus which had made him whole and
[2:34] therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus
[2:36] and sought to slay him because he had
[2:39] done these things on the Sabbath day but
[2:42] Jesus answered them my father worketh
[2:45] hither to and I work therefore the Jews
[2:48] sought the more to kill him because he
[2:51] had not only broken the Sabbath but said
[2:54] also that God was his father making
[2:56] himself equal with God then answered
[2:59] Jesus and said unto them verily verily I
[3:01] say unto you the son can do nothing of
[3:04] himself but what he seeth the father do
[3:07] for what things soever he doeth these
[3:10] also doeth the son likewise this verely
[3:14] verely is surely surely he's making sure
[3:16] of this for the Father loveth the Son
[3:20] and showeth him all things that himself
[3:22] doeth and he will show him Greater Works
[3:25] than these that you may Marvel St John
[3:28] 1412
[3:31] um verily
[3:33] verily I say unto you he that believeth
[3:36] on me the works that I do shall he do
[3:38] also and Greater Works than these shall
[3:41] he do because I go unto my father may
[3:44] God a blessing to the reading of his
[3:45] word you may be seated i' like to take a
[3:48] thought tonight my father worketh hether
[3:51] to and I
[3:53] work I'd like to recap uh last Wednesday
[3:57] and Sunday just to overlap and catch
[4:00] maybe a straggle that wasn't here last
[4:02] week trying to bring everyone in to
[4:04] where we are standing tonight and um
[4:07] we're were speaking about idols and
[4:09] intellectual conception of Christ and um
[4:14] how the Holy Spirit blessed us Wednesday
[4:16] and Sunday and I want to read something
[4:19] to you and by the way if you could maybe
[4:22] uh between now and Sunday if you could
[4:25] read prayerfully this book Christ is the
[4:28] mystery of God revealed
[4:30] I believe the Lord want to speak to us
[4:31] in there and if the Holy Spirit strikes
[4:33] something mark it down see cuz I want to
[4:36] study it and there something in here and
[4:38] the Lord perhaps want to bring it out to
[4:40] you and it'll be so much better if you
[4:42] have read the book see and when the Holy
[4:45] Spirit strikes things in here then you
[4:47] say oh then it quickened to you you
[4:49] understand now so praise the Lord so now
[4:52] um I want to read something from here um
[4:56] and I was speaking last Wednesday not
[4:58] the thoughts not even being in my heart
[5:01] and the Holy Spirit just said certain
[5:03] things about the Catholic church and
[5:05] whatnot and about fallen angels and
[5:08] things like that so sometimes people are
[5:10] new in the message and I want them to
[5:12] know that that's not me saying that
[5:14] there's a lot of new people here and
[5:16] they might think that I'm saying that
[5:18] some angels fell and those angels are
[5:20] Baptists and methodists and so forth but
[5:22] I want so therefore after preaching that
[5:23] last Wednesday night not even knowing it
[5:26] I happened to go into crisis and messy
[5:27] of God revealed here is the same thing
[5:29] right here so I want to read it to you
[5:31] cuz there are those who don't understand
[5:32] that see you catch blanks sometimes you
[5:35] know they say a fallen angel is a
[5:37] Baptist because they don't get it you
[5:39] know amen but anyway I'm reading from
[5:41] page
[5:42] 79 notice in the in this last days
[5:46] Lucifer is doing the same thing can you
[5:49] see it the devil doing the same thing
[5:51] building up a a hybrid Church a hybrid
[5:55] by hybrid members a hybrid by knowledge
[5:58] instead of the word by intellectual man
[6:02] instead of born again man building an
[6:04] intellectual Kingdom that will outshine
[6:08] Christ's little bitty flock see what is
[6:11] that that did that Fallen
[6:14] Angels the Bible said it was Fallen
[6:16] Angels who listened to Lucifer instead
[6:18] of Christ who they once belonged to is
[6:21] that right now listen close Fallen
[6:23] Angels what kind of angels Luther Wesley
[6:25] Catholic Pentecostals who kept not their
[6:28] first estate like the Angels did and has
[6:31] fell into organizations like Lucifer's
[6:33] main hole at NAA and and what have they
[6:36] done organized a great ecumenical
[6:38] Association of ministers to make an
[6:40] image unto the Beast as the Bible said
[6:43] and building a a Christian economy that
[6:45] will close the doors of this church and
[6:48] others like it see Lucifer at work I'm
[6:50] trying to bring you the three4
[6:52] Revelation a mystery of God what did
[6:54] they do sold out to reasonings of wisdom
[6:57] and education like Eve did Fallen Angels
[7:00] did and I want to read also from page
[7:03] 27 the same book when Eve went away from
[7:07] the word she went away from her mate and
[7:09] when the church goes away from the word
[7:11] to a denomination she rejects and
[7:14] commits
[7:15] fornications with the now watch with the
[7:18] world of man's
[7:21] Wisdom not just because with the world
[7:23] but with the world of man's Wisdom see
[7:25] is that wisdom see and rejecting the
[7:28] authority of God's word does that sound
[7:31] clear the Bible said committing
[7:33] spiritual
[7:35] fornications any word in the Bible
[7:37] That's rejected or if any here it is if
[7:41] any
[7:42] self-interpretation put to it that's why
[7:45] the Holy Spirit drove that down here in
[7:46] New York see self-interpretation put to
[7:49] it is absolutely rejecting and commit an
[7:53] adultery against a god that is your
[7:56] husband an adulterous never enters into
[7:59] the kingdom of God we know that now see
[8:02] that's what Eve done at the first place
[8:04] now notice again now what's the
[8:06] three-fold purpose manifest himself in
[8:08] Jesus Christ to come into the body by
[8:11] Jesus Christ to have the preeminence to
[8:13] what restore back Eden bring back that
[8:15] which lost that was the only thing out
[8:17] of order and all the rest of things was
[8:19] in order my what a powerful statements
[8:22] and so you can understand what we're
[8:24] talking about here and these angels
[8:27] coming down knowing how to worship we
[8:28] speaking last win
[8:30] and there's even a another message I
[8:32] think is enticing Spirits where he
[8:33] really brings it out I think Satan's
[8:35] tail Hooked a third part of them and so
[8:38] forth and brought them down here and
[8:40] then they anoint men and and set up a
[8:42] religious worship see and then they
[8:46] that's the Satan you know and then these
[8:49] Fallen Angels great denominations and
[8:53] then in the last days as brother Bram
[8:55] has warned us false anointed ones angels
[8:58] of light coming with light you see under
[9:02] the anointing now there's a powerful
[9:04] anointing that's almost like the Holy
[9:07] Spirit and this anointing actually
[9:10] thinks it is the Holy Ghost it's
[9:13] deceived itself because you look at
[9:15] these men who are deceived therefore
[9:17] they really believe that that they have
[9:19] the Holy Ghost they shout speak in
[9:21] tongues and get all kind of Revelation
[9:23] everything else and this anointing is
[9:26] found in St Matthew
[9:27] 24:24 for Jesus Christ placed that
[9:30] anointing there he said there would be a
[9:32] spirit in the last day that would think
[9:34] it was almost that it was Christ I
[9:36] actually believe it and only way you can
[9:38] tell the difference is the the
[9:41] word amen thank God for the word see
[9:45] that's they got to go off the word
[9:47] somewhere and you can just stand there
[9:50] with the word and listen to them mhm go
[9:53] ahead go ahead go ahead well uh now
[9:55] brother call you see I said go ahead I'm
[9:57] listening and all the time to scriptures
[9:59] is pouring through my mind trapping them
[10:02] trapping them here and trapping them
[10:03] there and they got the spoken word books
[10:05] all dirty and everything here and maybe
[10:07] because about 14 of them and and a
[10:09] brother come to me uh not long ago and
[10:11] he had about 14 books there he got to
[10:13] the 11th book the real punch line he
[10:15] couldn't find it God had pushed it
[10:16] behind him and he didn't see it I didn't
[10:18] say a word amen he couldn't find it all
[10:21] he had do was to show me the Bible but
[10:23] he had to show certain things in the
[10:25] spoken word book that some angel of
[10:26] Light deceived him with praise God back
[10:29] to the Bible the prophet said that his
[10:32] message brings us back to the Bible if
[10:35] you can't find it in here forget about
[10:36] it cuz his message is the Bible itself
[10:39] explained in our age amen so we are back
[10:43] to the Bible and when they don't want
[10:45] you to read the Bible or take the Bible
[10:46] then you know it's a a false light amen
[10:49] see so now and and this light can only
[10:53] uh deceived Through The Greening period
[10:56] when the the little lambs is just Lings
[10:59] trying to move out and and ripen they
[11:01] don't know what's happening yet powerful
[11:03] ministers come along brother Bram said
[11:05] this and said that and it almost is
[11:07] swing your head see now I remember when
[11:10] God gave a promise to Eve he says
[11:11] multiply and F and and also replenish
[11:15] rather and when he spoke it it was only
[11:18] his word that's right now remember that
[11:20] now it was only the word that's all it
[11:24] was it was an oncoming promise amen and
[11:28] when Mal car for spoke it was only the
[11:31] word oncoming promise am there we are as
[11:37] in that season when he speaks it and God
[11:40] take him away then God allows a false
[11:42] anointed to run into that vacuum and
[11:45] interpret it to you but he gave you the
[11:48] tapes he endeavored to lay it up for you
[11:50] that you might have the mind of Jesus
[11:52] Christ and you wouldn't have to take
[11:55] those angels of light so it's doing this
[11:57] Greening period they would this anoint
[11:59] anointing from St Matthew 24:24 would
[12:02] almost deceive the very elected if
[12:03] possible it would almost do it but see
[12:07] could and it has a almost period like I
[12:09] spoke the other day only during the The
[12:11] Greening period but oh brother let that
[12:14] seed get right and get a real Revelation
[12:17] that Jesus Christ is and then let the
[12:20] Dynamics fall into that church let one
[12:22] of them false anointed ones come on the
[12:24] scene then brother it'll burn up with 1
[12:27] million votes hey cuz ananas tried and
[12:30] the Holy Spirit spoke right out with 1
[12:32] million votes and away he went amen see
[12:35] so it's only doing that Greening period
[12:38] and then they come almost to deceive the
[12:39] very elected if possible with head
[12:41] knowledge Goliath and as we were
[12:44] speaking Sunday how Goliath had the
[12:46] church tied down for the last eight
[12:49] years pressed down and many because of
[12:52] unbelief and idols and things that
[12:54] wasn't sure and they were stumbling
[12:55] around and Satan knew that he could do
[12:58] that with your mind CU it's the M age
[13:00] and he could uh Marshall all of his
[13:02] forces from the pit 200,000,000
[13:06] demons loosed bound at the river
[13:09] Euphrates cannot go into the promised
[13:12] land just uh uh uh just religions and
[13:14] churches they can't go over but they can
[13:17] sure try to deceive you to keep you from
[13:19] going over and that's why I hate those
[13:22] devils and that's why I preach the way I
[13:25] preach and he's mean why you say that
[13:27] brother Coman cuz I hate hate those
[13:29] religious spirits that are bound at the
[13:32] river you fre you should hate them your
[13:33] own self praise God I hate them cuz God
[13:37] has anointed in my eyes to see their
[13:39] dirty works and he said the sons of God
[13:41] are manifested to destroy the works of
[13:44] the devil coming through deceit amen
[13:47] praise the Lord prise
[13:49] God any spirit that would come and tell
[13:52] a a sister to raise up a dress has got
[13:55] to be from the
[13:56] pit an angel of God will tell you lure
[13:59] it you know that's a man of God Amen
[14:02] that's how you can tell sisters when
[14:04] they want you to do the opposite then
[14:06] it's a devil from the pit then don't get
[14:09] if if some Spirit tell you to stop to be
[14:12] cut your here that's the from the pit
[14:15] it's against the word amen don't get mad
[14:18] at the man see cuz he's saying what God
[14:20] Said praise the Lord amen see so now
[14:23] Satan thinks through your mind now Satan
[14:26] is working on that second man that enemy
[14:29] man the outside man is the flesh the the
[14:32] inner man is the mind the spirit and
[14:35] that and our second man the the middl
[14:38] man that's your spirit your mind and it
[14:41] has imagination conscience memory reason
[14:44] affection Satan knows but you don't know
[14:46] it he cannot touch the inside inside man
[14:51] but you don't know it he knows it and
[14:54] therefore the the tape say to let you
[14:57] know he can't touch you cuz you're
[14:59] standing
[15:00] virtuous through the shed blood of Jesus
[15:02] Christ he splashed the blood in this
[15:05] generation and you come forward with his
[15:08] victory but therefore you don't know
[15:11] that and he thinks thoughts through your
[15:13] mind he's getting into that middleman
[15:16] your imagination your memory your
[15:18] affection your conscience and your
[15:19] reasoning that's the way he got you is
[15:22] it just a old flesh pun well he got him
[15:24] in the flesh and he's gone anyway but is
[15:26] that Christian who's trying to do right
[15:28] and he's tearing his mind now your
[15:30] middle man because you have imagination
[15:34] that is the same as the outside man
[15:36] seeing the flesh man see with his
[15:38] natural eyes the spiritual man on the
[15:41] inside he sees with his imagination and
[15:44] the the conscience is smell you can
[15:47] smell something and in your conscience
[15:49] you can tell something's wrong in your
[15:51] conscience just don't feel right you can
[15:52] smell it right away on the inside you
[15:54] smell it smells bad the conscious knows
[15:57] it he knows it ain't right it's it's bad
[15:59] smell amen something smell good then the
[16:02] conscience feels good that right so so
[16:04] therefore there's your smell and your
[16:06] memory of course is your hearing what
[16:08] you hear in the flesh man well inside in
[16:11] the middle man because he has a memory
[16:13] and it's all there in the memory the
[16:15] reasoning is the Taste when you taste it
[16:17] in the flesh man then in the middle man
[16:20] you you're are reasoning it out God said
[16:23] it then you said you begin to taste what
[16:25] God Said to see if it tastes all right
[16:27] it always tastes right to
[16:30] me praise God he's got the right amount
[16:33] of salt and pepper and everything else
[16:35] in each
[16:36] word I don't have to reason to see if
[16:38] it's if it's just right taste right all
[16:41] the time praise the Lord and then then
[16:45] in your human Spirit the devil likes to
[16:48] feel around with your affection and in
[16:50] the outside man he feels with his hand
[16:52] sometimes feels good and he'll drop a
[16:54] funny Spirit upon you in your human
[16:56] Spirit feels good you better get away
[16:57] from there and kind of funny feeling
[16:59] around like in your in your affection
[17:01] bring it to the word of God Amen well
[17:04] he's nice and she's nice well never mind
[17:06] that don't start feeling around whether
[17:08] they're nice or not bring it to the word
[17:11] amen so therefore now see what is he
[17:14] doing he's working through both of these
[17:16] outside men the middle one and the
[17:17] outside fellow well actually the the
[17:19] outside man should be gone anyway should
[17:21] be just this middle man that we're
[17:23] dealing with here see and so that's why
[17:25] he can real deceiving now and then he's
[17:28] trying to think thoughts to show you
[17:30] something with your eye your imagination
[17:32] your middleman's eye is Imagination that
[17:35] right therefore he brings in a picture
[17:38] he got to let your eye see it you see
[17:42] and then your inside man sees this
[17:44] picture of this thing and Paul come
[17:47] along and says cast down your pictures
[17:49] and your imaginations cast down every
[17:52] High thought that's against the word and
[17:55] bring it into captivity to the message
[17:57] the word of God see the you know so I
[17:59] don't care about you I don't care what
[18:01] you imagine cast it down the word says
[18:03] and it tastes good too praise God now so
[18:07] therefore the devil's working on your
[18:09] minds trying to get you to see these
[18:10] things and whatnot with your
[18:12] imaginations and people's imaginations
[18:15] run wild with them that's where you get
[18:17] the fear and things like this the devil
[18:19] gives you a picture of somebody with a
[18:21] long dagger trying to stab you in the
[18:22] back of something and you begin to sweat
[18:24] and run and all kind of crazy things you
[18:27] follow me now resist that fearful Spirit
[18:29] into oliv you amen but now God hides in
[18:33] the control room in the heart making you
[18:35] believe that what he said by Revelation
[18:39] now Revelation is what God Said So
[18:42] that's Revelation and faith is a
[18:45] revelation of what God Said God spoke it
[18:47] and he tells it to you you say oh praise
[18:50] God the Holy Spirit told me so and so
[18:51] and so God said so then you got a
[18:53] revelation Holy Spirit told you it'll be
[18:55] in the Bible here amen see now therefore
[18:59] there is this great battle that we had
[19:01] Sunday and Goliath he defies what God
[19:04] has already said and the Bible's already
[19:07] laid out the early church went forth in
[19:10] power and we have the history then
[19:12] according to 2 Timothy 3 in the last
[19:16] days he and highminded spirit comes
[19:19] forth the intellectual Spirit drops on
[19:22] the church he highminded lovers of
[19:24] pleasure more than lovers of God that's
[19:26] a spirit and is only for the land last
[19:29] days is intellectualism and it comes in
[19:32] to do battle against God and God begins
[19:35] to raise up a prophet in 1946 and he
[19:38] comes on the scene out he goes and that
[19:41] spirit is facing him after World War II
[19:43] the days of Miracles is pass and out
[19:46] goes Elijah and his first message that
[19:48] he preaches on the field for healing is
[19:50] David going after Goliath and he pulled
[19:53] his sword and he chopped off Goliath's
[19:55] head and then T Osborne and Tommy Hicks
[19:58] rest of him they pulled their soul and
[19:59] they chopped off the head amen but the
[20:01] main thing that we're talking about is
[20:03] when our David fac Goliath with the
[20:05] Seven Seals against the mind of the
[20:07] devil amen and the Seven Seals the mind
[20:10] of Christ tore down every stronghold of
[20:13] the devil's High thinking and God's mind
[20:16] is on the tapes amen
[20:19] anytime Satan come along with some false
[20:22] only want to try to give you an
[20:24] injection a drug to take you on a little
[20:26] trip somewhere all you got to do is say
[20:28] hold it let me find out God's mind about
[20:31] it amen is here on the tapes in the book
[20:33] somewhere I'll pray to my Lord and I'll
[20:37] fall down I won't receive nothing till
[20:40] God I see it here somewhere and then
[20:42] presently he'll tell you to pick up this
[20:44] spoken word book here or he show you
[20:46] over here and there you see God's mind
[20:48] coming against this strange thought this
[20:50] drug this pet pill coming in to take out
[20:53] of your mind all you got to do is to
[20:55] stay in the word of God don't go running
[20:57] after some false aned one amen see so
[21:00] now God had already said drive out the
[21:03] Giants see and then Israel knew that and
[21:06] they had heard about Moses and David and
[21:09] whatnot I mean Moses and Joshua rather
[21:11] and they know what had happened back
[21:13] there they knew it it was a history had
[21:15] already happened amen but yet the devil
[21:19] come working through their intellect and
[21:22] made them look at Goliath's
[21:24] size my look at the size of them look at
[21:28] those people there what they going to do
[21:29] here see the me now he's he's working
[21:31] through your intellect and working
[21:33] overtime on your
[21:34] imagination and he got you going see and
[21:37] then you can't do nothing but Along
[21:40] Comes a heart with God in the control
[21:42] room God said so he said I'll drive out
[21:45] the Giants I'll dri I spoke that already
[21:48] he only wants somebody to believe it and
[21:51] don't and and move with that right there
[21:54] so therefore he makes you see their size
[21:57] and imagine his story and feir grips and
[22:00] the Revelation comes back like with
[22:02] David the voice of God says I am Jesus
[22:06] I'm the same Jesus that was under the
[22:08] seven seal I'm not all these things that
[22:11] these Fallen Angels say I am I'm not
[22:13] what these guys that they're talking
[22:15] about here in these last days here he
[22:18] said I am the word I don't care what
[22:21] they are saying they are speaking
[22:23] through your intellect they're not
[22:25] speaking by the word of God Amen they're
[22:28] only bringing six
[22:30] seals you understand they are only
[22:33] bringing you the six seals they'll tell
[22:36] you what happen under the 1 2 third
[22:38] fourth fifth and sixth seal but they
[22:40] cannot bring you what's under the
[22:41] seventh seal they got to go off and
[22:45] under the seventh seal is the hidden man
[22:46] of God for the bride to feed on Amen see
[22:50] so now false anointing with self-
[22:53] interpretations and intellect praise God
[22:56] is coming out Goliath the head knowledge
[22:58] amen now Jesus says I am the word of God
[23:01] I under the seventh seal praise God

[29:27] all there praise the Lord see now
[29:30] subject tonight is Wil thou be made
[29:32] whole amen this was an invitation asked
[29:35] about 2,000 years ago by Jesus to the
[29:38] this lame man here as he walked upon him
[29:40] now note the difference here in St John
[29:43] 56 he's asking a question W Thou made
[29:47] whole he's asking a question of Faith
[29:49] now he's saying do you really want to be
[29:51] made whole to this lame man now he's
[29:54] speaking about a a resurrection power to
[29:57] make him whole
[29:58] now there was impotent folk laying here
[30:01] waiting for healing because because for
[30:03] their bodies and their souls they were
[30:05] weak and sickly and also helpless and
[30:07] they were blind and halt other words
[30:10] because lame had to stop and then sit
[30:12] down rest and then get up and walk again
[30:14] and they were with it paralyzed or
[30:16] shrunk and so forth and they were
[30:18] waiting for the moving of the water and
[30:21] God had always sent a a an angel down to
[30:24] move the water and when the angel dipped
[30:27] in and moved that water they could step
[30:28] in there and they could be healed and
[30:31] and God has done the same thing through
[30:33] the seven Church ages he sent angels to
[30:36] move the water amen arenius and polycarp
[30:40] and St Martin they mve the water and
[30:42] those who stepped in they were healed
[30:45] spiritually and also physically amen and
[30:48] God sent a seventh angel to a lame Hulk
[30:51] blind miserable with it paralyzed church
[30:54] and that seventh angel move the water
[30:57] and praise God uh we come down there a
[31:00] little lame amen not necessarily uh
[31:04] because as worse off as a as many people
[31:07] but we came anyway so what was it it was
[31:09] the heavenly father sending the word in
[31:12] perfect obedience to get one
[31:14] predestinated seed that's all it was and
[31:17] Harry comes on down there to this sheep
[31:19] gate and so now the angel come at a
[31:22] certain season and and whosoever first
[31:25] after the water was troubled stepped in
[31:28] he was made whole you had to step into
[31:29] it now you had to get in the water see
[31:32] amen you had to get in the word not half
[31:34] out and half in get in amen see don't
[31:37] hang outside hang inside but get in the
[31:40] word praise the Lord see now um as the
[31:44] word as the word approaches the man in
[31:46] perfect Obedience of the father and the
[31:49] helpless man he says to him wil thou be
[31:51] made whole and the helpless man said I
[31:53] have no man to put me in I'm not strong
[31:57] enough always got some excuse you follow
[31:59] me now it wasn't because too much wrong
[32:01] with him brother BR said because he may
[32:02] have because he may have had a prostrate
[32:04] or something see now but God sent Jesus
[32:08] to him nevertheless he was predestinated
[32:10] he was the one amen praise God you are
[32:14] the ones God you're the ones I don't
[32:16] care what you feel like but you're the
[32:19] ones amen it's you it's nobody else if
[32:22] if if they if it was them they would
[32:23] they would be here tonight and you'd be
[32:25] outside so therefore the fact that
[32:27] you're he you must be the one amen I
[32:30] mean God knows what he's doing doesn't
[32:32] he I mean he wouldn't get the wrong one
[32:35] he knows who you
[32:37] are praise the Lord Brother have some
[32:39] faith and believe in what you're talking
[32:41] about glory to God Amen so many were
[32:45] worse off you were the one Tony he
[32:47] wouldn't got you and brought you in here
[32:49] at the End Amen you and your family

[33:02] something there and he would drag his
[33:05] way down there and I can picture him
[33:08] coming down to Beth Sada it was the Gate
[33:10] of mercy and Harry comes down there for
[33:13] some mercy cuz he knows that something's
[33:15] going to happen if he can only get there
[33:17] and he would get there praise God and
[33:19] even if it was 38 years I feel that
[33:22] because he was an elected seat of God
[33:25] there was something in the control room
[33:27] amen there was something inside saying

[38:22] years amen they finally grasp it why
[38:25] because you were predestinated to get it
[38:28] Sunday morning cuz you had you said one

[38:34] have the revelation of who you are this
[38:36] morning then rise up take up your bed
[38:38] and walk keep walking then amen don't
[38:41] lay back down again Rise Up In The Name
[38:43] of Christ and take up your bed and walk
[38:46] amen now notice the the persecution for
[38:50] believing what the word said uh his this
[38:53] uh man here he got up he said rise up
[38:55] take up your bed and walk and away he
[38:57] went his faith was a little shaky the
[39:00] lame man was rebuked because for
[39:03] believing that Jesus Christ was the same
[39:04] yesterday today and forever and doing
[39:08] this last eight years or so uh our faith
[39:11] was a little shaky but we believe that
[39:13] he's the same yesterday today and
[39:14] forever and many rebuked you many
[39:17] rebuked you the Jews I'm speaking about
[39:19] the religious Jews in in the message
[39:21] amen amen
[39:23] see praise well you know he believed now
[39:27] the lame man here believed without
[39:30] knowing the scriptures now if he had
[39:32] know the scriptures then he would have
[39:34] known only God could have healed him but
[39:37] the scripture says here that he didn't
[39:38] know who he was when they asked him for
[39:41] a testimony who is this man he didn't
[39:44] know the man's name he didn't know he
[39:45] should have said God did that but he
[39:47] didn't give glory to God because the
[39:49] devil got to his mind and blocked it out
[39:52] he was a Jew that should have known that
[39:54] God heals he had to know that
[39:58] but somehow you are you reading
[40:01] me are you reading me somehow for the
[40:05] last eight years he just couldn't know
[40:07] it was
[40:08] Christ he thought maybe well year but
[40:11] maybe Wednesday I'll get it I just
[40:13] understand Wednesday maybe next Sunday
[40:15] see he just couldn't say it's Jesus and
[40:18] let it go with that had figured it out
[40:20] you know so he couldn't give his the
[40:23] right testimony he was shaky and so have
[40:26] many of us been shaky since since
[40:27] Malachi 4 left we just couldn't figure
[40:30] out just well what is it it's the word
[40:33] that's all it
[40:35] is that's all it was you see and and we
[40:38] had if he had only known it was the word
[40:41] the word said I am the Lord that Health
[40:43] thee he should have known that he was
[40:46] healed but he didn't know that and many
[40:48] though God has done so many things for
[40:50] them the past eight years they still
[40:52] don't give glory to God CU when they
[40:55] they come in the house of God they won't
[40:56] sing and and they won't praise and they
[40:59] so therefore they act like this man here
[41:00] they don't know who it is but if they
[41:02] ever get a revelation Like Sunday
[41:04] Morning who it is then they'll Praise
[41:07] Him and they'll thank him and they say
[41:09] thank you Lord for saving
[41:11] me I'm saved as the song says save save
[41:16] if nothing else happens I'm
[41:18] saved
[41:19] amen that's all God is wanting to get
[41:22] that Glory out of you that's all so
[41:25] therefore uh he did know the word that
[41:27] he was the one that was to come to
[41:28] Israel and though the scripture said so
[41:30] he should have known that that that was
[41:32] the Christ no man can heal but God he
[41:34] should have known that now see but
[41:36] anyway he thought now uh uh what
[41:39] ordinary man could say that other words
[41:42] to him what ordinary man could say that
[41:43] will thou be made whole and then turn
[41:46] around tell them arise take up your bed
[41:47] and walk and you walk that had to be God
[41:50] you understand now see and and then so
[41:53] this man now he had Faith though when
[41:55] this man spoke and he even know who he
[41:56] was he rose up and he walked amen he got
[42:00] up see praise God now uh but he had been
[42:04] saying I don't need any man you see
[42:07] because he don't have a man rather but
[42:09] the revelation of Jesus Christ as of who
[42:11] he is then you don't need a man amen now
[42:15] during this man's testimony here Jesus
[42:18] Christ was hiding by Design you see the
[42:22] man questioned by the Jews could not
[42:24] just come out and give positive answers
[42:27] and neither did God give us the full
[42:29] Revelation when when brother Brenham
[42:31] left so that we could positively come
[42:34] out and tell everybody what's the seven
[42:36] seal is what is the tent and what is so
[42:39] on so we don't know so we're a little
[42:40] shaky you follow me now amen you got it
[42:43] now so we can't positively tell anybody
[42:47] what we're just believing well we
[42:50] believe it so it's a promise amen we
[42:52] don't know what it is we believe it amen
[42:54] so now this man was not sure see he was
[42:57] not sure that because he could reproduce
[43:01] Jesus Christ to them again he he
[43:02] couldn't say for sure because he could
[43:05] you know what I mean now so therefore
[43:07] some feel well if I don't see with my
[43:09] eye maybe it ain't so but God's able
[43:12] anyway amen and then there are those who
[43:15] don't stagger anyway God said so from
[43:17] here they don't look around with their
[43:19] eyes amen they'll look around and see if
[43:22] so and so is here and if this one is
[43:24] here Jesus Christ is here amen that's
[43:27] all I need to be here is him I don't
[43:29] need anybody else here amen praise the
[43:32] Lord see now they because they they had
[43:35] asked a man or what man was that and he
[43:37] didn't know who he was now watch Jesus
[43:40] was
[43:40] hiding because because He Slipped Away
[43:43] and Malachi for slipped away because
[43:46] because God took him away and Jesus is
[43:49] is hiding tonight see and for H years
[43:52] Jesus was hiding just like he was doing
[43:54] here he was just hiding and now after
[43:57] all uh cuz in this day here after all
[44:00] who had heard of some man in their day
[44:02] doing the works of God after Moses and
[44:05] Joshua and also Elijah what man could do
[44:07] those kind of works after them you
[44:09] understand me now who had ever heard of
[44:11] that you understand now people want to
[44:13] know the the Jews today want to know
[44:16] after Malachi 4 left whoever heard
[44:18] anybody raising the dead and doing these
[44:20] things it's all over with the seven
[44:23] Church ages finished what are you
[44:24] talking about he which is perfect is
[44:26] come we heard it
[44:28] all whoever heard raising the dead and
[44:31] because because casting our devils and
[44:33] doing the works of God after Malachai
[44:35] for left whoever heard of that my my my
[44:41] well sir I I I suppose we all know that
[44:43] one there huh amen now who told you to
[44:46] pray for the sink Malachi 4 is gone who
[44:49] told you to do that how dare you the
[44:51] Jews you know the Jews the Orthodox Jews
[44:53] see now praise God well then when you
[44:57] get out there you sort of hold your
[44:58] peace down at Jeff you go eat and you
[45:01] talk and you're going back home but when
[45:02] you get back here Jesus Christ is the
[45:05] same yesterday today and forever and I
[45:09] know who he is I know that I know that I
[45:11] know praise God and like Peter you say
[45:14] be it known to all of you that by the
[45:16] name of Jesus Christ and even by him do
[45:18] we do the works of God by the name of
[45:21] Jesus Christ by the person the nature
[45:24] the teachings we come in the name of the
[45:26] Lord do the works of the Lord praise God
[45:30] so now during this hiding period the
[45:33] Sheep not quite sure they ain't quite
[45:35] positive yet they're a little shaky you
[45:37] understand and so see it's a revelation
[45:40] of Christ and they believe and because
[45:43] however after about 8 years now of
[45:46] little shaky and they they believe
[45:48] though see uh uh having a test and
[45:51] giving out their testimonies to the
[45:53] husband and wives and family and jobs
[45:56] and sometime because because they trap a
[45:58] lot of times now that's all right God's
[46:00] only testing you he sends a trap for you
[46:03] to see if you still believe it amen see
[46:06] and but you are predestinated you're
[46:08] going to believe it amen sometime
[46:11] because you come in here with your Tails
[46:12] down amen but you still believe it amen
[46:16] and he just rubs you down nice and then
[46:18] you feel better you purr in amen
[46:19] wonderful praise the Lord see now we see
[46:23] over here in the 13th verse here and and
[46:26] he that was healed with not who it was
[46:29] for Jesus had conveyed himself away a
[46:32] multitude being in that place afterward
[46:36] Jesus findeth him in the temple and said
[46:39] unto him behold Thou Art made whole S no
[46:42] more L A worst thing come unto thee why
[46:45] now look what happened here Jesus Christ
[46:48] here the word returns back in the voice
[46:51] of the
[46:52] resurrection and does he find this man
[46:55] there's no more pastors and we don't
[46:57] have to come together does he find him
[46:59] in some house somewhere all messed up in
[47:01] some sinful condition no he finds a
[47:04] little lame ones here tonight and they
[47:06] ain't quite sure but to hear nobody got
[47:08] to tell them to assemble yourselves
[47:10] together that's in the word because they
[47:12] believe that and they're in the temple
[47:14] they're in God's house cuz they love God
[47:17] and they're here and that's where when
[47:19] the voice of the Resurrection comes back
[47:21] around and rides that trail the second
[47:23] time that's where he finds them at oh
[47:25] praise God amen not in a dead spirit and
[47:29] not hardly singing and whatnot but
[47:30] they're praising God and they're giving
[47:32] glory to God how are you brother and
[47:34] they're given mercy and love out and
[47:36] they arrive unto Christ that's the
[47:39] attitude that's the frame of mind that's
[47:42] how he finds them on one Accord sitting
[47:44] just like that though a little shaky
[47:46] ain't quite positive but then something
[47:48] begin to move and he they saw the sword
[47:51] chop off Goliath's head and it got
[47:53] stronger amen and they're assembling
[47:56] tonight amen praise the Lord and they're
[47:58] praising thanking God for making them
[48:00] whole and one thing they know that they
[48:03] rose up and took up the bed and they've
[48:05] been walking since
[48:06] 1965 that's the only thing that they can
[48:08] say I'm not what I want to be but I sure
[48:11] ain't what I used to be amen and I'm
[48:13] walking in the light praise God now here
[48:17] they are in the temple and they have the
[48:19] right mind the right attitude they in
[48:21] they praying and they're praising God
[48:23] and now the word comes back around for
[48:26] vind ation confirmation here he comes
[48:29] here amen the second time around and
[48:31] then he says behold Thou Art made
[48:36] whole my the voice of the Resurrection
[48:40] speaking back you are whole now they was
[48:44] already whole but they had to believe it
[48:47] they had to take up their own bed and
[48:49] walk but this time he says behold Thou
[48:52] Art whole period that's it now that's
[48:57] Revelation that's Faith that's God
[48:59] speaking the voice of the Resurrection
[49:02] into your hearts and a voice drops down
[49:05] and speaks child of God Thou Art whole
[49:08] amen can't nothing happen to you after
[49:11] that one cuz God do spoke to you by his
[49:14] word the same voice that spoke through
[49:16] Malachi 4 has promised to return back
[49:20] and speak again amen here he comes wil
[49:22] thou be made home that was the first
[49:24] time cring your faith will will you be
[49:27] made whole and the man had the faith
[49:29] brother Ben so he says yes amen he said
[49:31] well rise up and take up your bed and
[49:33] walk amen begin to walk here's because
[49:36] here's your promises walk in your
[49:38] promises there and he began to walk for
[49:40] about eight years in the promises praise
[49:42] God now God gave him a message of
[49:45] Salvation And also healing through
[49:47] Malachi 4 he says Rise take up your bed
[49:49] and walk every promise is for you and he
[49:52] began to walk he began to testify little
[49:54] shaky but he kept going now he could not
[49:57] positively exactly explain what it was
[49:59] fully about to those Jews see can't get
[50:03] around those Jews out there one they
[50:05] standing around you know what is this
[50:06] here it's that is this you see but now
[50:08] when that same watch him

[50:14] when the voice speaks the second time
[50:16] what does it say over here um afterward
[50:19] Jesus find him in the temple and said
[50:21] unto him behold Thou Art made whole S no
[50:23] more L A worst thing come unto thee th
[50:26] man departed and told the Jews he went
[50:29] to those Jews himself amen here he comes

[50:38] forth Harry comes with the baptism of
[50:40] the true Holy Ghost amen and he seeks
[50:43] those Jews out like David did David
[50:45] hasted and ran to Goliath to tell that
[50:48] intellectual believer something amen so
[50:52] it says over here the man departed and
[50:54] told the Jew that it was Jesus
[50:57] there it is praise God which had made
[51:00] him whole he knew cuz the voice spoke
[51:04] back behold Thou Art whole so he knew
[51:07] the voice of the Resurrection not
[51:09] another man it's just Christ's voice
[51:12] speaking back that you hold praise God
[51:16] and that voice says sin no more that's a
[51:19] Greek word uh h a m a r t i a and that
[51:23] Greek word means missing the mark and

[53:11] could come down through Malachi 4 and
[53:13] open them Seven
[53:14] Seals and call us when the fact the very
[53:19] fact that we even heard about a prophet
[53:21] was enough that's right that was it

[53:26] David hurled the stone of Salvation to
[53:28] the head that's that's the finish of it
[53:31] right there we should have known and we

[1:02:56] answered them my father praise God
[1:02:59] here's my title my father worketh hither
[1:03:01] to and I work therefore the Jews sought

[1:03:06] had broken the Sabbath but said also
[1:03:08] that Jesus was his father making himself
[1:03:10] equal with God then answered Jesus and
[1:03:13] said unto them verily ver I say unto you
[1:03:15] the son can do nothing of himself but
[1:03:17] what he seeth the father do for what
[1:03:19] things soever he doeth these also doeth

[1:10:28] Carl praise the Lord he said I'm not
[1:10:31] dead here I am I'm in my bride right

[1:10:37] time the word answered them the word
[1:10:39] wasn't hiding now he was there and he
[1:10:41] stood there he said my father worketh
[1:10:44] hether to and I work oh my mighty hour
[1:10:48] is here for the bread to say my father
[1:10:51] work hither to and I work he said my
[1:10:53] father work hither to and I work my
[1:10:55] father has worked even until now he has
[1:10:57] never ceased working this is what he's
[1:10:59] telling them now see he is still working
[1:11:02] he's laying in here now and I must be at
[1:11:05] his Divine work amen now he was working
[1:11:08] the works that the father gave him to do
[1:11:11] that right and since the father worked
[1:11:13] on the Sabbath here we go now they were
[1:11:15] mad because he was working on the
[1:11:17] Sabbath he like that see and then when
[1:11:19] he says my father they had another
[1:11:23] charge Oh my he was claiming deity you
[1:11:28] got it now my father he must have said
[1:11:31] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:11:32] Word was with God and the Word was
[1:11:35] God inequality with with God in power
[1:11:38] because verse 19 and verse 20 because he
[1:11:41] also claimed because equality with God
[1:11:43] in works so he claimed equality with God
[1:11:47] in nature in power and and works and
[1:11:50] they was really stirred up now so now St
[1:11:54] John 3:34 for whom God has sent speaketh
[1:11:57] the words of God for God giveth not the
[1:11:59] Spirit by measure unto him John said so
[1:12:02] amen my father working hither to and I
[1:12:05] work now he is referring to the
[1:12:08] delegated because Authority given him
[1:12:10] because Hebrews let me see I got a
[1:12:12] scripture here Hebrews I have many more
[1:12:14] but I'll just chop it down I don't want
[1:12:15] hold longer I want to hurry along
[1:12:18] sister uh God who has hundred times and
[1:12:21] in diverse maners spake and time pass
[1:12:23] unto the fathers by the prophet hath in
[1:12:25] these last days spoken unto us by his
[1:12:28] son whom he hath appointed ear of All
[1:12:30] Things by whom also he made the worlds
[1:12:33] there he was amen he knew what he was
[1:12:35] talking about and they understand that
[1:12:37] so therefore he had Authority now God
[1:12:40] works on the Sabbath as well as on other
[1:12:43] days in upholding the the universe and
[1:12:47] running is infinite mechanism amen so
[1:12:50] he's working every day his word is at
[1:12:52] work holding up this universe on the
[1:12:55] Sabbath and every other day amen so
[1:12:58] Jesus knew that so he said my father
[1:13:00] work at H he's still working right now
[1:13:02] and I work also amen praise he ain't
[1:13:05] never stop praise God see he works in
[1:13:08] Providence watching over and also caring
[1:13:10] for the uh dependent because creation he
[1:13:14] watches over his flowers his lies and
[1:13:16] plants and trees and whatnot and he
[1:13:18] cares for it he gives it rainfall and
[1:13:19] whatnot he's still working amen praise
[1:13:22] Lord is that simple praise praise God
[1:13:25] Amen see so now here Christ worked in in
[1:13:29] healing on the Sabbath and also uh
[1:13:32] because providing food for the hungry
[1:13:34] and also uh
[1:13:36] because uh providing acts of mercy and
[1:13:39] love Devil's mad that's all right so
[1:13:43] since the father worked on Sabbath he
[1:13:46] did too the same lord of the Sabbath
[1:13:48] will work in the true Sabbath the rest
[1:13:51] with any true seed who will believe him
[1:13:55] did you hear what I said who rest who
[1:13:58] Sabbath the Sabbath is the Holy Ghost
[1:14:02] amen so Christ the father work on the
[1:14:05] Sabbath every day therefore Christ works
[1:14:08] in the true Sabbath which is the Holy
[1:14:11] Ghost amen he works saving healing
[1:14:15] comforting in the Sabbath on the Sabbath
[1:14:18] the Sabbath is the rest that is the
[1:14:21] Sabbath praise God Amen so therefore he
[1:14:24] saids my father work hither to and I
[1:14:27] work also praise God and we have a
[1:14:30] promise verily verily I say unto thee he
[1:14:33] that believeth on me the works that I do

[1:14:41] work H the two also amen because we are
[1:14:44] in the Sabbath amen praise the Lord in
[1:14:47] Jesus Christ you get it hope you get it

[1:15:11] church on the Sabbath with great power

[1:15:22] that the uh Christ worketh H or two and
[1:15:24] we work also amen praise the Lord now
