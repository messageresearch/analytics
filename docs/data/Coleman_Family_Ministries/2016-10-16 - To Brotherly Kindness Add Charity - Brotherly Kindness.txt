got your Bibles let's turn to your Bibles there glory to God St John 21 you can seat be seated here's my seventh Thunders the lord gave it to me in 1974 verse 20 is the seventh one then Peter turning about seeth the disciple whom Jesus loveed uh following which also lean on on his breast at supper and said Lord which is he that betrayeth thee and Peter seeing him saith to Jesus Lord and what shall this man do keep this in your mind this thought here what shall this man do see uh oats oat and corn and and so forth what shall this man do on the seventh age don't worry about if I'm raising oat that's none of your business what do you mean asking Jesus what am I supposed to be doing what are you supposed to be doing glory to God what shall this man do H Jesus said to him if I will that he tar till I come what is that to thee follow thou me now he never said that he would T but what if he would T see he said uh if I will that he tar till I come what is that to thee father th me verse 23 then went this sa abro among the Brethren that the disciples should not die yet Jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if I will that he T till I come what is that to thee now today in the message the same thing cuz Jesus spoke through the prophet and they say all kind of things today he didn't even say those things what if I will that he tar till I come and John tar till he come he picked John up on the a of patmas and showed his coming but you can't figure it out there wait till the season come let it be revealed and they done the same thing again trying to figure out what the son of man is saying it's a revelation in the season and he reveals it to whomsoever he will oh my [Applause] glory this is the disciple which testify of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true and there are also many other things which Jesus did the which if they should be written everyone I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written amen my seventh Thunder praise God glory now Peter had the instructions follow me now he wanted to know what was was John supposed to do and Peter noticed John falling without the same invitation he had and John was his buddy and yet even though that's his buddy he still didn't want John to get in on his thing this is me and Jesus not you but yet when he goes in I'll be with you amen what are you following here for this is me and Jesus here and John want a little blessing he started folling but then uh amen so Jesus said what so he said what shall this man do amen and Jesus rebuked his curiosity by stating that if it was his will that he would live to his second comment that's none of his concern you mean to tell me that what I'm doing in here in New York is nobody's concerned my you mean that Trinidad ain't got nothing to do what I'm doing nobody in Guyana or Tucson or jonville or Europe there none of their business what I'm doing in here oh I thought they supposed to check me out my what is that to De follow thou [Applause] me my my thank I I'm free Glory my it was enough for him to be concerned about doing God's will in his own life they got they got to take take care of their own churches don't try to take care of this church here God taking care of this church they be seated oh Jesus said what is that to thee follow thou me Jesus words however were readily misconstrued as an an assurance number one that John would live on until the Lord's return he didn't say that he the the if was easily forgotten and John himself corrects this false impression in verse 23 said the Sayan went abroad John wrote it himself I wonder if the same thing has happened in this age how many says went abroad that the son of man never said and says went abroad about many things in the message I remember 1967 amen a binding Spirit came in the message to bind the ministers and some little some kind of a denomination was moving in and and only a few could preach amen amen and there's there's always those who who uh only want to hear the tapes and read the books and that Spirit was there then in New York amen and uh this tape went out and I knew that it's going to get out of New York and they going to here they come amen remember brother Hunt and the minister was shook up about it and then they called me up and said well what do you think uh can anybody preach I said look I don't know about you but the prophet ordained me to preach the prophet told me to preach and told me to go overseas also told me go overseas and be a missionary Oh Praise so I'm ordained to preach so I don't know about you brother and then I went to the barber shop this binding Spirit was in the message and I was coming back from the barber shop and all a sudden the voice of God come in my car what is that to thee follow thou Me Oh My Everything broke away I tell you to a child of God there's nothing like being in a trial and the devil's got you hem in this way him in that way and all of a sudden you pick up a tape or you read a scripture and the power of God come down and break the shackle and feathers and the voice of God said what is that to thee follow thou [Applause] me sh oh what beautiful words what a beautiful thought I'm thinking Hallelujah and you know what when that binding Spirit moved in I did follow him all the way to 1974 and down come the voice of the archangel hallelujah oh my in spite of all that was in the message in 70 6768 9771 in spite all the cursings revilings and I think this and this New York that I followed him all

drunken woman with those men up in Indiana there he called them outside he said don't condemn her you too oh that's when I caught brotherly kindness my the love of God is so wonderful Jesus loves you the three greatest words that you can hear Rebecca is God loves [Applause] you thus Jude exhorts the bride today in brotherly kindness to brotherly kind is at charity keep yourself in the love of God looking for God's mercy I want God's mercy and you want it too and above all these things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins therefore to brotherly kindness and charity and be adopted and go after the lost in love amen Revelation 2217 those who are thirst even whosoever will let them come respond respond to both the intellectual unbelief and no faith and moral doubts number two opposing their own selves up one day down the next day save these people in love be kind amen hallelujah many have been affected and deceived by false teachings and false spirits and false interpretations they're God's people and we got to get them amen amen and the end in view is not expulsion and condemnation of the doubters but their restoration to Fellowship fellowship with Jesus attitude is one of grace and mercy toward the sinner if you now you hate the sins now but love for the soul amen sister l in 197 before when U that Thunder shook her house Calla and Terry there they heard the Thunder but Mr L didn't hear it and the next day she was ironing and then she was wondering about the Thunder and her husband didn't hear it and the Lord spoke to her I happen to see these words in my old notes tonight and spoke to her and said that's what I forgive you does in the spirit world it thunders my my I forgive you that's the Thunder not backbiting evil smizing my may God Thunder out tonight forgiveness pianist orist let's let love do it for us God's grace to you by the word let you see your mistakes we preach the word and it's God's grace to let us see our mistakes that's what the preaching of the word is for and then you can repent and put them away and then you give the same Grace to your brother or sister so another ages here now Malachi 4 said on perfect Faith amen page four I'm picking up uh St Mark 11 that's where he he started at and so um he reads for very I say whosoever shall say this mountain and he comes on down he says and when you stand and pray and forgive if you have order against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses and if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses and verse 19 paragraph 19 now faith is based on forgiveness and here the prophet ties third pull Faith to speak to the mountains and ties it in to forgiveness brotherly kindness and you cannot have it unless you can forgive and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into a place to where we could really see Apostolic times moving Among Us that's what we all hunger and it's just laying right at the door we see it but we just want to see more of it we wanted such a flow that it'll be a help to us and flow out to others how many want that amen you could flow can you imagine on your job and Christ will be on your job and walk among your relatives and that anointing will be there and then they look at you and they know is something and if they seeds of God they'll fall down and save me Lord Oh My Oh my he that is in you volume 6 12 page 12 paragraph 51 but if you he and brother BR picks up St Mark 11 here but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses then he says it's on condition see it's based on a condition is the faith did you notice that there the Thunders first came brotherly kindness Revelation then came the Thunders to give faith for Rapture and Grace that's the way it came in 197 before amen it's got to come that way West Palm Beach Florida 1953 Rapture in faith will only be revealed to those who forgive their brothers teaching on Moses if we have one a among us we stand in damnation of Hell's fire perfect Faith now faith is based on forgiveness so I say tonight to brotherly kindness at charity that you might uh anoint your seven Thunders with love amen and let charity cover a multitude of sins the Christian attitude is one of Mercy toward the sinner together with a a hatred of the sin Revelation 22:17 and other Sav with fear pull them out of the fire hating even the Garment spoted by the flesh blemishes and spots on the Garment adoption
