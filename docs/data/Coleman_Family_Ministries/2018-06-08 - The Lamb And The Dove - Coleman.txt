let's stand for the reading of the word of God praise the Lord first John the first chapter the first epistle of John that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handle of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show it showing to you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our Fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ in His Son cleanses us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us brother we got him on the run the word is going forth now here's the way he got you tied up in the ninth verse if we confess our sins he won't let you do it there that's where you are right there and he's going out of here and he's here tonight but he's going out he knows where I'm going tonight he knows that he's got to go out the door he knows that God's gonna put you in a position to receive the Holy Ghost and he don't want you to know how to receive the Holy Ghost but we got the word of the Lord and the Holy Spirit come for the Sheep to bless you now God can't lie he's an already put a blessing up on you last Sunday now I like I defy anybody to take a blessing away from you amen you know when you say man you say 2nd boy if we can now you know we're in a battle don't you you should know that well then you but then you you get to you go to getting in the Spirit of God in the Word of God that's that funny feeling leave if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us Philippians 2 I'm so positive that God is going to fall in here tonight I'm not even thinking about it not even oh it don't even enter tomorrow I know he's here I'm positive amen Philippians the second chapter if there if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill you my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being a form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross may we bow our heads for word of Prayer our Heavenly Father we read your word now in God we are trying to move into position for the fire to fall upon us and that's the faith bank and the enemies fighting Lord but Heavenly Father were calling up reinforcements God are we asking for the ministers affairs to come down now from the throne tonight gone and go among the people and begin to cut their unbelief away for them tonight the great battle is on in father I'm so glad I'm on your side because I know we have already overcome we have already won tonight's metal because before the foundation of the world I saw this battle tonight and I shouted for joy and the morning stars sang together God made this face for them tonight may they pull out their sword to stop being wishy-washy give in spirits that is given to any old spirit upon them from outside from working from distance from that God made up they know it this is the end of the world and all things is happening everything is ready God may they listen tonight may they begin to pray in the seats and at the world or it might come through tonight Heavenly Father we commit the message into you we pray God and we acid in Jesus name now Heavenly Father sweep this evidence out of here in the name of the Lord we ask that and we commended for your sake amen you may be seated thanks be unto the Lord my God my God what was the matter the night we God took us up into the heavens to come in the night like we did brother we should have been shouting and praising God at the altar be hidden here it should be at the altar down there praying nothing my praise God praise God boy anyway here we are I want to read something to you now and the blessing is on you right now praise the Lord brother you better have your own farm you come in here I got mine amen I didn't finally I brought it with me praise the Lord now this is the mind of the Spirit amen this is a gun in simplicity I don't want to speak tonight like I spoke Sunday night I was looking to come here so we'll praise the Lord and lastly Matt or I can just stay up there and you could pull in this pull it out I coming tonight praise the Lord now we're back where we were Sunday night Amen by faith amen page 34 now this is speaking about Elijah how he humbled self now this is the key so zero in on the word humility notice you'd larger Holman himself and stayed with what God said in such a way that it pleased God to take the same spirit from Elijah and promised to shove it it three times down the road from there and he did it excuse me God love that spirit I was upon that simple uneducated woodsman from back there in the woods somewhere he was it was so obedient to his word she to me now so large it was so obedient to his word that he could say Elijah do this Elijah would do it can you say tonight my child stop doing this and you'll do it there's where your missing God right there when you don't do it when he tells you to do it through the pulpit and the message for Sunday morning when it comes and Elijah would do it all Roger did it he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you even just something as simple as killing an animal that's how beating it was to keep the word there's the blessing lain in there and that's why I'm trying to get you tonight so you can get the blessing it was obedient to his word that he would say Elijah do this and I just would do it and God hid himself in there in such simplicity till the all tall and that old crank don't have nothing to do with him and so for they call you cranky when you're being obedient to the word you mean you no brother no love but one day when he got ahold of his ol you got it he got old in his bald head and his whiskers hanging down gray what few hears he had hanging over his shoulder his little skinny arms and meat flopping on him like that come walking down that road to Samara and her eyes looking up to the sky with a Crooked Stick in his hand he wasn't much to look at but he had thus saith the Lord he didn't stammer with it he didn't stutter he didn't say now great Ahab he walked up and said not even a do will fall from him until I call for it God had honored his simplicity now you see while it was in the simple way and everybody against him everybody was at his throat all the Ministerial Association everything else would at his throat that's true trying to get rid of him and everything else but in that simplicity even though they had no cooperation with his campaigns and whatever more they had everybody thought he was a crank God was hiding himself but when he could now here it is but when you come time for that seed to get ripe that had been planted God manifested himself by sending fire out of the heavens and licking God hiding in simplicity and then reveal himself again short please got to do it he always he always did it in such a way did you hear what I said but when it come time for the seed to get right just think a seed has been planted in you for eight years oh is it the ninth year time for that see to be ripe if it is it says here God sent fire out of the heavens hiding for eight years in simplicity no sensations nothing no goosey feelings nothing happened just simplicity going to church taking the word and might have seen dry but that's all right simplicity no great campaigns and spectacular is going on but waiting for the one great spectacular hey man that's gonna smother all the rest of them out no one down in your heart was beating in Edit God set it in God's gonna do it a minute I don't care how it takes 25 years like Abraham what God is going to do it I don't care if the old go against me speak against me don't even give us a telephone call and tell about the service or what-have-you but God is going to do it therefore what is here's God's pattern tonight God never changes god hiding and simplicity of the word the very word that was sold for eight years that was God did he hear me say it again the word that was sold to you'd win see Sunday Wednesday sunny was God and all God was doing looking for a place some skin veil to hide behind amen in obedience obedience is better and all your sacrifices to hark it in the fed of realms though you give you a body to be burn though you give away your goods to the poor though you know all mysteries do you have faith to move all the mountains but obedience is better than hold your sacrifices just if you could find our people who will obey the word I must show you tonight why that is soul praise God I know I'm standing at tonight I know tonight if you were will receive the message tonight it'll open the door for you brother it'll show you how to enter him amen that's right sure it pleased God to do that yes sir I guess I'm gonna want to read to you now open it up and don't close up now amen you get an open you getting warm now praise the Lord the fires big is being killer and Dussel that's those mental spirits around you right now because you're believing saying they're coming around here they're coming closer and closer they're feeding because your heart is beating right now won't know what is this secret here is God an angel they're beating around you tonight lets it be the name of the Lord amen page 24 Christ is revealing his own word all if we can only write now the way you were right now if you had a business women' when I had worked in here we don't know what would have happened any the Holy Ghost could have fell tonight just the way you are right now if you have been this way we walked in here anything could have happened before I even hit to the pulpit affirmative Phil in here praise the Lord amen page 24 crash civilians onward thank the mighty God well let me saw a little bit before that he hid himself in his promised word in the days of Moses how he hid himself in the days of Elijah how he hid himself in the days of Jesus how he hid himself he was in the world and the world was made by him in the world knew him not he came to his own his own received him not see he hides himself from the smartest and to lecture men there is on earth you say well this is dr. Holy Father soul and soul I don't care who he is God hides himself from him and will reveal it to babes such as you such heirs will learn babes of God predestinated seen think Nehalem truck driver think the money God setting in his own word blinding the smart educated people of this present age and they don't see it they think it's a bunch of fanaticism look at him standing there hiding - Pentecostals Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Revere himself right out publicly and showing all kind of things even putting it in the papers and things like that yet they don't see it oh god oh god how great revealing himself to whomsoever he will or you say brother Jones or brother so-and-so he's a great man he'll see it oh no he revealed it to whom he will you say my wife don't see it and she's a Christian woman he revealed to whomsoever he will my pass is a great man that's right but he reveals himself to whomsoever he will now check with what's been revealed to what's happening and then you can quite understand it amen praise God God hiding and simplicity praise God and a page 42 want to strike that do you see him now in his word and all of his words all of his word made manifest right here before us Oh Church of the Living God get to your feet believe him brother Brent preach the same thing here try to make the people believe Church get to your feet and believe him with all that's in you hold to that little wheel in the middle of the wheel let us stabilize every move and every motion that you make every thought that you have may be controlled by this power on the inside of you because God is setting right in his word of this hour in the evening light showing forth delight praise God what our excitation to us to believe the Word of God now one of the first John 1:7 I want to strength to scripture here for a minute yes sir but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin now if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us now verse 8 through 10 he explains about walking in the light now all things are made manifest by the light now listen the presence of God the presence of God which is the word this word in it that's been hiding in us is the presence of God at you don't feel it there's a feeling God is in the word when you receive the word without sensation you receiving the person of Christ praise the Lord now the presence of God which is the word see brings a consciousness of sin in the nature did if you put the shade down the prison of God can't come in and show you the sin that he can cleanse you and there's your trouble then when you're scared to come to me it's not you afraid of me it's the spirits upon you that know how call those spirits out so that you might be free and they know that when they trouble me see it again it's the spirits on the people that don't want to come into the presence of God of a man that has faith in it we'll call those spirits out by the word they don't wanna get free the spirit solar tube free because he whom the Son of Man sets free is free indeed and we all set in heavenly places can you imagine somebody heavenly place up there with the angels and the four beasts around the throne all scared and when you're like this this shouting and praising God and running around is scared to speak to brother Paul and scare speaker brother brown kind of Fugees are that so wrong something wrong somewhere and if we are sitting in heavenly places your favorite speak to me how can it be let's lay it there now this is Wednesday night let's lay that thing down later on somehow some way must be some spirits upon you I will say a plane is there some Devils upon you absolutely what it is if your frame shouldn't be afraid well thank god this man will tell me I'd be afraid of the man wouldn't tell me and so be a pastor he'd be a phony be looking for a mullah yes sister she's all full of sin your lovely sister you're very sweet see brother my the presence of God brings the consciousness of sin in the nature in the presence of God he's in his word God hiding in his word then if the man will do like in the absolute bring the people on the condition of the what the presence of Almighty God and in their free praise the Lord now if you say you ain't got no sin like the Pharisee Laura I thank God I had daddy like that man the Pharisee stented beating his breast you finally know he didn't even know that he had sin on him you see therefore then the verse 9 and 10 makes him a liar so we had no sin because we lie we and we deceive themselves you see now sin and sins the blood of Jesus Christ is deep divine provision for both of them now to walk in the light is to live in fellowship with the father and the son that's walking in the light sin which is unbelief interrupts but confession restores that fellowship then if the minister comes around and God sees a few little lambs tramped brings up methods out like tonight to get the presence of God to them and they back up and go downstairs and full fidget around our heart that you have no fellowship and you missed your chance for fellowship that night through the Word of God and for God is the word see then immediate confession keeps the fellowship unbroken I mean God loves you he knows you can't do it how can we do it so he has a blood atonement foot but he can't get the blood to you if you pull the shade down and hide like Eve did that right did Eve sin and Adam Adam Adam where heart down looking all over for him tonight same thing we are now looking for you and they hidin did something wrong see and then a devil take it and Mount Sinai and whip you good there and yes sorry yeah I'll tear you up next thing you because you get up on your wife and your family or she get up on her husband go on a job you're mad and grouchy God don't love you no more this is wrong and begin to rip intense snort see and all you have to do is Jesus standing there bleeding wait the blood is dripping waiting for you and he don't bring it up to you either if he can only get you here though praise the Lord in the old Tabernacle there were two lights what we call two compartments you all know it the holy place with the shewbread and the candlestick and the most holy place the Shekinah glory the manifested glory of God was the Shekinah glory now these two places are now on one Accord in the same method 27 for God rent the Veil the veil being the type of Jesus Christ body of his human body rather in rendering in it signifying a new and living way was open for all verse we could go be into the inner inner court sanctum in there and into open for all believers to come into the very presence of God with no other sacrifice nor the priesthood just Jesus Christ and to his very presence which is the Shekinah glory the manifested glory of God is the word in season now there's still two lights today but they're one and here's what they're doing Christ the light of life through the spirit through the seven churches he gives like the candlestick throws light upon the message for each age you see and the people are drawn to the lane see on the holy things of God the shewbread the word and the altar instance prayer and so forth see and but then also any change as he throws out the message there he beckons the bride to come and live in that light where he said in the word and the others won't come to the word they come around the word you know same with me now see but they won't come to the word itself and the manifested Shekinah glory is now shining on the face of Jesus Christ and that's his word now into this twofold light we are as believers we abroad and Peter's told about into this marvelous life they wish you come to show forth the the maulvis praises of God amen now we walk in the light which merely he gives in every each by the message and so forth into this first folate carnal believers see put their own interpretation to the late see and then they take what they want they do what they want to add or take away these corner believers and they go into sin after they do it did it in every age and the light came melikhaya for God took him off the scene then come to force and onehans and show them false lights and they misinterpret the real light and God give them eight years now and they all dried up but during the eight years in simplicity the word itself God gave the bride chance to dwell and live in the light where he is everywhere no interpretation just whatever he's doing and then in there we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses from all sin knows the groups where there's no more passes and no more Holy Ghost and all these cuckoo things why brother don't they know Llewyn that in the days of the when the son of man is is to be revealed saying Matthew 24 there's a parable there about the the faithful and wise servant and that the servant is to give our meat in due season and all the whole thing is that the Son of Man is revealed as the word and in the the two servants are told to give our food and due season and then the Son of Man is revealed now and in the the faithful and wise servant says that Jesus Christ is here today and it gives that out for about eight years and signs follow with then all this believe it for a while and after I may about 68 or 69 they begin to say that the Lord tarries he hasn't come yet and he may be he'll come in a tent and maybe come in a resurrection and nobody got the Holy Ghost now and then he's not there the son of man is not there if nobody got the Holy Ghost he's not here now and then he begins to smite his fellow servant with this doctrine did you get it he begins to remember brother Bram's dream back was served with as a term he had a dream about this big denominational father what a big a big three corners stick and every time the woman the church rolls up he beat her down again well what was these servants doing with the sticks they was whipping the fellow servants the past eight years with funny doctrines every a little bribe would raise up to believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever when they hear about New York City somebody will put them down there's no more Holy Ghost there's no more signs there's no more nothing only one man can do it and you got to wait whipping them down with the smite gnam amen now watch the son of man is there all the time hiding in his word and the unfaithful service don't know it he's all around whenever they got a tape that he's there where there's a similar book he's there but they don't see him he's hiding and simplicity watching to see what they gonna do with his word he's seen what the ministers are going to do it they're gonna preach it the same way Paul preached it the same way Elijah preached it the same way a recent public up in Timothy and Barnabas and the rest of them preached it if they come along but now we can't do this here and we can't lay hands upon the sick and we can't do these things here you see and not realizing that the promise comes which is a promise a promise that's what I'm going to do then have you take the promise then you must suffer the reproach of barrenness you must be bearing for a while you get it you every son must be chastised must be tested and chance of what you believe and if that's why I pray for the sick it won't happen I don't get too scared to come back and play again God promised he didn't tell me Lynn told me to believe it he told me a bit the son of man is here I believe it where's his word he come down to America for mouth of powerful Raziel them and a son of man just behind my veil and behind yours and that's ways that I just told you the mystery of the personal crash being around sensation hiding then the son of man he's there all the time catches the unfaithful servant in our when he thinks not and he's a true servant but he appoints him his portion with the hypocrites didn't call me hypocrite but he appoints him his portion with the hypocrites see some none here some innocence not a minor she took my no that's why I rather bring him one of the absolute the Word of God then when the Son of Man returns back for that second ride he finds a faithful servant giving out the same food because he realized that the faithful servant through the eye of faith sees the scriptures coming to pass as a son of man being revealed then he gives that faithful servant makes him ruler over all of his goods adoption you got him that's what's going on praise the Lord so we walk in the light amen now in which he lives see then to walk in the light the bride tonight is exhorted to walk in a light not merely which he gives William Brown as a prophet come on to Arizona let's do this here has a tape said all right but let's get into the word weighs an innocent cause the message is taking him back to the word and if you can get back to the world where he's living at then the blood cleanses you and then you have fellowship one with another otherwise is wonderful we have the light on hidden things just age and many believe it the six seals but could lit up everything in the church to six seals but he's living under the Seventh Seal silence amen she's under the Seventh Seal hiding simplicity nobody knows what's happening you understand me now see but the bride noticed the word so she has a revival going on and within her like the Welshman and yes way he's living it now we walk in a lab where he lives that then we have fellowship one with another what a revelation we have friends where he lives he lives in every word his presence is in every word his power is every word his nature is in every word now it's one condition if we walk in this light as he is in the light where he is dwelling right now then the power in the blood cleansed us from all sin now one say something I don't read some T again from God hidden in simplicity page 56 why to refuse light is to walk in darkness that put their children in death row he's talking about this case down in Texas with just a man who had taken the picture of the pillar fire I want to read on down now he hid himself in the death of Christ but manifests himself in the resurrection all my and so forth there's no end to it you can just keep saying but there you are to refuse to say there is sunshine is to go into the basement and shut your eyes from the light that's right and remember the only way that you can be wrong is first to refuse right and to refuse open your eyes you'll live in darkness if you just refuse to look how are you going to see watch the simple things it's the little things that you leave undone not two big things you're trying to do oh my then look here and there we are it is these little things that we have endeavored to teach you little things where you can little slice and where are this person they don't mean nothing in your way they're not a big person so and just by passing and so forth you know respects to one another and that's why we have endeavor to teach you respect for one another in these little things because that's where God is that on page 58 think everything will run just as common as as it can be a fanatic message will go by and the first thing you know ministers going somewhere he's never come back he proudly went to the woods hunting he's never returned no more this fella went somewhere you know what happened I believed that young girl she must been called away somewhere you know someone take a girl out there and ravish and probably throw it in a river she was nobody handful of it see he says ninety nine out of every may say one out of every hundred million would ever know anything about it unless somebody's acquainted with said well the girls missing you talk about the rapture how is gonna be a fanatic message will go by and it did and they're waiting for something he said John's own disciples was didn't know that Elijah was there he said the first thing you know the place will be up on earth and then they'll see the son of man he didn't say in what form and they said why say it describes at last miss first come he's already come you didn't know it brother what an hour for us a Pyncheon and move into God let all the foolishness goal this is a time to dig in get down into God and see all the foolishness finish with now if we walk in the light as he turned the light where he's dwelling right on now he said the simple things that write the little simple thing see then the power cleanse us from all sin now God hiding a simplicity of the little things little things you leave undone not the big things you're trying to do see and now but in simply obeying God like Elijah did obedience is better than sacrifice see now there is God hiding and simplicity then revealing himself out to the obedient ones taking away their sins through the power in the blood the other thing I'm saying though in a little simple things that there's God and those who do the little things God takes away their sins then the others who stumble on top of these little things don't even care thing about it they're fussing and stewing and there's no fellowship and they're scratchy and they're hard and stiff because they won't come to those little things and that's where they stumble over top of God and the prophet of God warned us and told us and yet they still won't come to the little things they've seen and then now in second Timothy second Timothy the first chapter well praise the Lord yes sir hey men second Timothy first chapter 6 verse wherefore putting remembrance that I'll stir up the gift of God which is indeed by the putting over my hands for God have not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind what a wonderful scripture and this word spirit we don't have the spirit of fear you don't like you to point your nails everything skids a little shadow we have a spirit of power and I always check up this word in the Greek and it's the word this name power is a Dunamis inherent power to reproduce itself implying need of constant activity and use for continued reproduction our English word dynamo and a dynamics now it means the branch of mechanics treating of motion that's what a dynamics mean the principles of active operation just as a dynamo needs to be in motion to produce power amen so one needs to stir up into flame the gift of God in his last you got it and the only thing I know it can stir up to get the Guardian life is the Word of God then if you don't want the word on the world can you be stirred up it's impossible forgot to even get to you you understand them so therefore st. John 1:11 for as many as receive him he gave them power amen to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name those without the Holy Ghost that would receive him he gives them power to become the sons of God he gave it to Peter in him and they didn't have the Holy Ghost the st. John 17 far the way they have we have they have received that words a may kept them in fellowship with him is that right then when the flame seems to have died out he have a broken fellowship then where it comes to you see to stir up the gift in you of life you see if you will receive me the word I'll give you power if you only receive me I'll give you power for my thought is there is power in the bird see the power is in the blood now we want to find out tonight where's this power in the blue net and we want to find out amen see I give you power now receive my words then we understand why there is no revival in our souls sin in one form of another it's blocking it up the little thing that God is asking us to do and we want something big from God how can you give it to you when he actually do one little simple thing in order dude you won't do it well the only working God bless you I'm gonna show you why I wouldn't care how scratchy it gets tonight there don't make no difference to me you see because if this long person who gets it then we can have a revival if one person gets what I'm talking about tonight see it is fighting all the way tonight see there's only one thing in the world that can free us from sin only one thing and that is the power of the blood of Jesus Christ now what is it that gives the blood of Jesus Christ is mighty power I want to know what is it in the blood that gives us so much power don't you want to know by the panel of the blood just a few things peace is made between God and man just blood God acts upon birth and gives peace between him and man by the power and this is the power of the blood now there is forgiveness of sins and eternal life for all who put their faith in Jesus Christ by the power of the blood by the power of the blood Satan is overcome by the power blood there is continued cleansing on broken fellowship amen by the peril of blood we may be sipped free from the tyranny of an evil conscience thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts yes I get sick and tired of hearing thoughts thoughts that is the devil terrorizing you with thoughts tyranny dipping your down with thoughts and here's God telling you to take his thoughts and you refuse to do it you'll ever dwell on his thoughts you'll ever believe that your scoundrel you did you did this you did that with all the time he is telling you that you are my bride there is no sin at all and you won't take it why you rather be terrorized by a devil but if you only take the blood and the power in the bird will set you free [Applause] may priests car the peril of blood makes us it gives us power to serve the Living God by is this power in the blood has infinite power with God we want to get to tonight the most unworthy the remote the richest person in the world through the power of the blood has Liberty to enter into the Holy of Holies of God's presence and live there all day I mean stay there all day question what gives the blood all this power and how many experience its full power in our lives they answer to the question first question script you hear revelation 7:14 and I said unto him Sir thou knowest he said unto me the survey which came out of Great Tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb revelation 12:11 and he overcame him by the blood of the Lamb now we want to find out what is about this lamb now know is it was not the blood of a mighty warrior but the blood of a lamb in other words that which gives a precious bloodiest power with God for men is you ready here comes is the lamb like disposition attitude of the Lord who hid it and of which it is the supreme supreme expression the title the lamb there's a title the lamb wouldn't it be wonderful to be known as the lamb what a wonderful christ-like sister she's a lamb he's a lamb that's what I want to be known as a lamb there's the power now here it is first it first of all the lamb is is is that is that is a description of his work you see a sacrifice for our sin that describes it see now the second thing the title the lamb has a deeper meaning it describes his character the lamb describes his character he is the lamb in that he is meek and lowly in heart gentle and unresisting and all the times are rendering his own will to the father's and for the blessing and saving of man all the time he had no rice I had many inscripted by one going tonight Isaiah 53 he died on the cross because he is the lamb you understand no other way he didn't go to the cross and become a lamb you get it we didn't go up there and then he had to die so he had a funny had to give in but because he was a lamb he went to the cross amen so all the good different isn't it so it's like Ghostly you serve God he finally gets in here and pin you down show your revelation show your vision if finally you say okay Lord I'm gonna serve you you don't want that nobody wants stamping and whack and chop you up and then finally you you pin into the corner and you can't get out you exposed and then you have to serve God serve God because your lamb God don't want to do the head you don't want to follow behind you you did this you did dad you see to me now that's rote but he's looking for lambs tonight you got two lambs in here the glory of God hath filled a room amen now so he died on the cross because he is a lamb let us ever see this disposition in the blood now the blood is the life and in this life was a disposition of a lamb then if I have his blood in me I'm a lamb and then I the word goes forth yes Father I humbly bow my head like he did and what a church that is Oprah now you getting somewhere now now you see the power in the blood oh here it comes now let every listen now as you sit here tonight let and any when you win the blood goes forth and you think you got your sins and so forth and our rough thing come up maybe done something and here come the word and soon you get kind of tight in the flesh then let every mention the blood call to mind the deep humility and self surrender of the original lamb then you think on that den yourself yes Father and their yard is your land is the power i'ma bring I'm more clearly for you see for it is this disposition that gives the blood is wonderful power with God amen well Hebrews 9:14 forever links the blood of Christ with his self offering to God and it is this fact that bestows upon it its power with God for men you see for this lamb disposition has ever been of supreme value to God God can use that nature full he's God he's the Creator he wants all his subjects to be lamb like and he can dwell with him / he's God humility lamb likeness the surrender of our wills are what he looks for supremely from man now in God's mind it was for this reason that he created Adam he created Adam a lamb you get it and so then when he create a lamb so he the Dove the power is the Dove you get to know the Dove is the power Amen the lamb is the nature humble then the dog can alight on the layout that's what will wait for me so the Holy Spirit is tonight the simple message is showing you how to enter him this is your chance tonight don't flub it you flubbed it for nine years then don't after tonight don't miss it you'll make it clear to you tonight amen God created Adam so he could he'd add of could dwell with his creation but when he come down he's got to be on humility because God is humility amen now it was the refusal of Adam and Eve to walk this path that constituted the first sin they did they want self-will II wonder what she want to do then she was no more lamb like she become a goat nature but but but the way you know we should but I don't think so and there you go you see so if you come if you know it's the word don't fight it don't fight it you know the man stand up here what God has vindicated it at the HS you gonna fight it yes or no sing now and it has been the heart of sin ever since to do Yoel against his will now it was a bring this lamb just after Adam and Eve sin then God was busy setting things in motion he's going to have around praise God sold it genesis 3:15 he started for that lamb the woman shall have a seed is going to be a lamb amen started a naval an Abraham right on down and all God's people were humble they're all lambs sheep and a shepherd live let him breathe got into the heavens all the way through the Bible was sheep Ram that's what a sheet means or a layout or lamb disposition a lamb header tude not my will entire will be done now it was to bring this lamb disposition nature back to earth that's why Jesus came to get it back on earth ellika for William Branham alaya another layer is we saw it we saw the life generous that we handle it we saw it we saw it manifested that right and then the bride comes along to let Jesus the Dove now Jesus is a dove and we to Lamb so she lets Jesus the Dove come into her nature to give her power in her blood you got it then she is letting the Dove have preeminence and the preeminence automatically cleanses every bit of sin and unbroken fellowship then you see the tub in the lamb walking together on the earth the bride in Jesus Christ 1 what a love affair for 8 years has been going on what's it for to restore the whole family back to the Garden of Eden where the Dove and the lamb can dwell again all he wanted to do it at him and Eve and he wanted to add him to call from the dust some more limbs and sin interrupted the program but brother Branham said in the Millennium he'll call them from the dust again I can't figure it out we already take it over there does it be a blessing when I get there to figure it out amen might have some more out of plants over there I don't know praise the Lord Amen praise God at night now you see why I say I know where I'm going tonight I know where I was going I know why he was fighting yes sir it was simply because the father saw this in him that he could see here it is this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased to dwell in a lamb God was so happy he found a lamb again he wanted handle but had him sin become a boat but God fell his lamb Jesus Christ the Lamb of God and ended up was so happy to death come down in dwell with the lamb and led the lamb to the slaughter took him there for you and me it was because the shedding of his blood nature life so supremely Express this disposition that it is so utterly precious to God and so all availing from man and his sin you get it now see this nature God love this lamb like nature notice when you be around and your fellowship and no brother or sister it's China now the Lord told me a vision didn't or get that out of the way see just get in the word and bless one another when they come at a say mmm the okay praise the Lord wonderful see now but when they just get on the word and in the Holy Spirit is there yet you can tell because this one will speak and everybody listen then the other one will speak and as they keep doing then the Holy Spirit comes closer and closer because it's all Lambs there and a dog just comes out and blesses from one to the other one amen and then the oil it gets so wonderful you feel fine don't you you get into one little fellowship where somebody want to get up with the word and give exhortation what not saying well I was I guess I'll be going after a while see if you're gone see but when you get the lamb like nature's around no backbiting no evil surmising no talking about this and talking about this one in that one just little lambs praise the Lord in your fellowship and a dove there's all around your fellowship that's the kind of thought ship to have brother see now there is the power in the blood the secret is out this morning I was sitting there thinking about this and this struck me this morning he said that that this is what happened they don't understand this here and just like that the Holy Spirit just spoke to me said the power in the blood is the dynamics and I said praise be to God the power in blood is the dynamics and the dynamics is God praise Allah and we are the mechanics the lamb like natures and then the blood of Jesus Christ with the dynamics in it the power in it cleanses us from all sin takes it right away the Holy Spirit is the dynamics in the blood of Jesus Christ then the word the word which is the dynamics of God by the Holy Ghost and there you a little trap you're sitting out there and you're sitting there you know what's happening in half dying and the father loves you he says that that the dynamics after he stirs up the gift in you Septimus second what happened not even understanding it I said praise God the Heavenly Father said to mrs. first Ana tell me to tell you to confess and the blood is being stirred didn't I say it well the diners were stirring the blood and this morning he revealed to me what is shortly on 1 September 2nd this morning he said the power in the blood is the dynamics and brother you talking about when the Ministry of Christ come how in the world is sin gonna stand there you tell mother stirring up man that dynamics the dove of God is coming in here to his lambs and keep them stare 24 hours a day no sin will have a chance to get in there no one go can tell oh ship praise God or will be living where he is in the Word of God amen praise God the word stirred up the gift in you the spirit of power inherent power to reproduce yourself implying need of constant activity that's why we must have the word constant stirring up stirring up you know those who don't have the word they could try see this not being stirred and then the activity it can't move and then when a little thing happened with you well I'm not going to go to church that's just where he wants you ain't gonna go okay after all I'll take my unbelief in there and well your unbelief been in for all the time anyway say miles we'll come on so you can get free funny maybe that's a bit that you get free you've been here unbelieving all the time but maybe that's the very day you'll finally get a revelation raise the Lord amen so the dynamics is a treating of motion Dinamo needs to be in motion so our needs to stir up into flame the gift of God in his life now the gift of the word the nature the lamb disposition we have the spirit of power friends when we confess as Lambs no buts it's set something into motion at the throne just thing right now in your hearts that you would be confessing the father's looking over he wants to dwell with you as soon as he see his word going forth to correct you oh brother he comes out of the heavens and it's a dove and and lights like you said father I don't know you your messenger just spoke something tonight just spoke my heart and here o'clock it's more I did a certain thing I confess that not writing your secret and I'm not become saying right now the Heavenly Father sends the power of the blood which is a dynamics and takes it right out of you because you confessed it then the power of the blood cleanses you right in the seat see how easy it's done and there's no but then you go out of here brother you want to tell you for yourself I'll tell you I got a blessing tonight you can't explain it because some happen to you same amen or you're speaking a word and you'd be low and down like it's a come along and bless you throws down some barley up on you the power in the blood is a demon but dynamics which comes upon the nature of the blood which is lamb like disposition northern Eicher can it fall upon to manifest the power of the word there's not another nature that the power of the blood can fall upon to manifest the power of the word there's only own limbs there's your answer to the revelation of September 2nd confess your sins he is stirring up the power of blood to free you from sin and praise God he sent down a dove and as the power in the blood to stir it up now we have it now see but being by being willing to have the same disposition that ruled him you see just as it is the disposition of the lamb that bestows upon the blood its power so it is today if we are willing to be partakers of the same disposition of the lamb then we can finally know the full power of God in our lives sister Nadine the DOE shall come upon us as lambs do we understand dear friends tonight we may be partakers of his disposition if we want to for has been made transferable to us by his death it's ours if we want it you see all the fruits of the Holy Spirit mentioned in in Galatians 5 is ours how does it come to us by the Dove so anyway it comes and when it does bring zit you just know it's it's just passes all understanding praise God what are they but expressions love peace joy long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness self-control they are expressions of the lamb like nature in you then that you have the nature of the word which is - you have a spirit in you to begin with to obey the word then the Dove comes and settles down and manifests the word and the word is peace and joy and long-suffering and healing and everything else you get it now so that if you don't have nothing well you got the wrong nature so I can tell you and then you need to repent and ask God for our lamb lank nature then you can have a revival in your home then God will send a servant of God your way with the word of the Lord and may you might have a little situation going on right now if you really made up your mind tonight after nice message that that's why I missed the power of the blood because of my disposition and my attitude lord help me to understand from now on starting Sunday morning whatever is preached let that be for me oh you can only come to that tonight brother you see something happened in here you found in our friends see praise God amen and the Holy Spirit wants to fill us why to reproduce himself in us he wants to do it more than what we wanted he's waiting for his little Adams and Eve's he wants him to come for us he can dwell amen so when you see a person with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Dove is dwelling with them they have an unbroken fellowship they make mistakes they quickly humble themselves through the Word of God that's where I started out I could understand you know what do people get so mad about if they claim to have the Holy Ghost I can see a person that don't have the Holy Ghost but the person claims to have the Holy Ghost what are they up tight upon now I want to know about peace and love and joy and long-suffering with the Holy Ghost I'm speaking about now now those without the Holy Ghost I give you power to become the sons of God and I give you a promise and you believe it unto it I'm going to fill you and all the eight years ten years I have given you power to become the sons of God you know why because you took the word and the Dove was in the word to power praise the Lord so either way you go now see but now are we willing can you nurse that is the question let us stand can you nurse if you can nurse brother the Dove can dwell with us Sunday morning next Wednesday falling Sunday it's going to be the best has been pronounced already can we nurse can we come to our mental attitude tonight mature that we finally are not going to back up from the Word of God which is only Jesus the dove trying to come in and free us from sin he knows we don't know it was a tune for walking the lighten ending are we willing we can walk in the light you know where he is if we're willing we don't try to make ourselves feel the humility of Jesus you know feel feel no we only have to walk in the light the word and be willing for God to in that here it is be willing for God to reveal any sin that may be in our lives that's the price you gotta pay now many of us have fought this for 10 years before it ran this way in that way but we come to the end are you willing now tonight you want to walk in that beautiful light you want the Dove to come down and overtake you and bless you he's here tonight moving around you now little Daniel had a dream well Daniel Gonzales he was standing by the water cooler drinking water and I approached him and a thought of unbelief struck Daniel and I said Daniel don't think that he said what am I thinking and I said in the dream I told him what he was thinking he became afraid of me see now I want to say to you Daniel don't be afraid of me he's up there praise the Lord don't be afraid it's only the Dove wanting to come and rest upon you and when this message came to me my wife was talking to his mother and that's the dream he had and I knew what it meant it meant that he's a little child and we're his children and you're afraid and you think I know some things on yourself and say it's not me it's a dove oh praise God the Dove wants a he knows what's in your hearts the things that's in our hearts he wants to get rid of so he sends his word down the line to get rid of it then he sends the power out of heaven stirs the blood up and it's gone he does all this that we could have fellowship together and that's why the Word of God has been preached these eight years oh it was that he could have a place somewhere we can have fellowship and pour his blessings in there so little Daniel don't ever worry about your brother I'm your brother pastor but that's the one you fear amen honor the servants of God and honor one another but fear God amen any brother with any fear up on your brother don't be afraid of me that's the spirits upon you that don't want to be you to be free come in my house sit down have fellowship praise the Lord that was for somebody there there there free tonight the Holy Spirit just spoke to them don't be afraid here's a dream right there he was afraid see so what that represent or any minister representing coming to you standing for the word represent Christ here he's got to have a body somewhere it's gotta have a agency to bring us a word through you get what it means now friends don't be afraid see we want to walk in that light amen see but now the devil wants to come to you see but he must call out sin by the word so he can cleanse it and then he can abide with you he's gotta do that he can't stand see him now and he's so wonderful he has a scent of torment waiting for you calls her right out and cleanses right away he is the quickest person to clean up something brothers clean you know I've seen some fast women clear up some spots some things but not quicker than God brother he'll flash it out in the minutes and the second it's gone quickening you can say anything it shoots out of heaven gone go what if I'm labouring for he told me tonight there got to be free once and for all you must get rid of this fear to confess this fear that a brother Coleman Brotherhood knows something on you talking to me well sure we talking to you that's the dog talking you weren't wrong with you but he he did all this for you me too he died for you that he might give you his nature then send a dove down to have fellowship oh brother we isn't he beautiful beauty [Music] come where the do to suffer mercy chamber right well sure day and night Jesus the
