[0:00] Let us turn to the word this morning as
[0:03] we settle down. Um St. John the 14th
[0:06] chapter
[0:08] and 16th verse through the 26th verse.
[0:12] Ephesians the 3r chapter
[0:17] 16th verse through the 19th
[0:20] and Galatians the 5th chapter
[0:24] fifth and sixth verse.
[0:26] Now, I'm going to take my time this
[0:28] morning cuz I am unfamiliar with the
[0:31] pulpit. Haven't been here in quite a
[0:33] while, but the Holy Spirit, he knows.
[0:35] So, I'll just take my time. So, I like
[0:38] to teach this morning. Sometimes he like
[0:40] to come back and teach the word to the
[0:43] people. That's what we're here for
[0:45] Sunday school this morning. So, um
[0:48] people might uh know which way to grow
[0:51] up in. I'm reading from St. John the
[0:54] 14th chapter. the 16th verse. And I pray
[0:58] the father he shall give you another
[1:00] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:03] forever.
[1:04] Even the spirit of truth whom the world
[1:06] cannot receive because it seeth him not.
[1:09] Neither knoweth him but ye know him. For
[1:12] he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[1:14] you. I will not leave you comfortless. I
[1:17] will come to you yet a little while and
[1:19] the world seeth me no more but ye see me
[1:22] because I live ye shall live also at
[1:25] that day ye shall know that I am in my
[1:28] father and ye in me and I in you. He
[1:31] that hath my commandments and keepeth
[1:33] them. He it is that loveth me. He that
[1:36] loveth me shall be loved of my father
[1:39] and I will love him and will manifest
[1:41] myself to him. Judas saith unto him, not
[1:45] his car, Lord, how is it that thou will
[1:47] manifest thyself unto us, and not unto
[1:50] the world? Jesus answered and said unto
[1:52] him, If a man love me, he will keep my
[1:55] words, and my father will love him, and
[1:58] we will come unto him and make our abode
[2:00] with him. He that loveth me not keepeth
[2:03] not my sayings. And the word which ye
[2:06] hear is not mine, but the Father which
[2:08] sent me. These things have I spoken unto
[2:11] you, being yet present with you. But the
[2:13] comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom
[2:15] the Father will send in my name, he
[2:18] shall teach you all things and bring all
[2:20] things to your remembrance, whatsoever I
[2:22] have said unto you. Ephesians the 3rd
[2:25] chapter 16th verse
[2:28] that he would grant you according to the
[2:31] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[2:34] with might by his spirit in the inner
[2:37] man
[2:39] that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[2:41] faith that ye being rooted and grounded
[2:44] in love may be able to comprehend with
[2:47] all saints what is the breadth and
[2:50] length and depth and height and to know
[2:52] the love of Christ, which passes all
[2:55] knowledge, that you might be filled with
[2:57] all the fullness of God.
[3:00] Galatians 5
[3:03] 5:6.
[3:05] [Music]
[3:08] For we through the spirit wait for the
[3:11] hope of righteousness by faith. For in
[3:14] Christ Jesus, neither circumcision
[3:16] avaleth anything, nor uncircumcision,
[3:20] but faith which workketh by love. May
[3:24] God a blessing the reading of this word.
[3:26] Take a title from this. Faith workketh
[3:29] by love.
[3:31] Yeah. Um,
[3:34] Paul here in this great book of
[3:37] Ephesians,
[3:39] the book that I was reading in the
[3:40] seventh church age book there the other
[3:42] day, the the chapter about the Ephesians
[3:45] said that was a holy people. Ephesians
[3:48] was the spiritual church. Now,
[3:52] naturally, the message from the angel
[3:54] went to the Ephesians church and the
[3:57] Corinthians was in the Ephesians church
[3:59] 8. There's all types in that church age.
[4:03] But this particular Ephesians church
[4:05] itself, Paul could teach all the great
[4:08] doctrines to them. See, and he could
[4:10] tell them being Gentiles, most of them
[4:13] because after those original ones that
[4:16] uh explain to them the workings of the
[4:19] nature. He explained to them by nature
[4:22] because you you're Gentiles and war and
[4:24] strife and all these things that was
[4:26] what you did when you was before you
[4:27] were saved. But he could explain to them
[4:30] that you're washed by the water of the
[4:32] word. He could tell them that they was
[4:34] uh predestinated
[4:36] unto adoption and all of the great
[4:40] doctrines there. And here to me, this is
[4:43] one of the greatest prayers in the Bible
[4:45] for is a prayer for inner fullness and
[4:49] knowledge. See, and and the thing that
[4:53] strikes me here, the 16th verse, that he
[4:55] would grant you according to the riches
[4:57] of his glory to be strengthened with
[5:00] might by his spirit in the inner man.
[5:05] So, we see that there's a supposed to be
[5:09] another person,
[5:11] a new man, a different one, a new
[5:15] spiritual self that's supposed to be
[5:17] inside.
[5:19] And this only way that this person can
[5:22] can get in there is through a baptism of
[5:25] the Holy Ghost.
[5:28] And then that's a seed. See, God is
[5:32] love.
[5:34] But he comes. So he's the word,
[5:37] but he starts out with a seed.
[5:40] Plants the seed. Then it's the seed of
[5:43] love and it's a spirit in spirit. And
[5:47] then it is to produce at the end love,
[5:51] joy, peace, temperance, longsuffering,
[5:55] meekness, gentleness, and all of the
[5:57] fruits of the spirit. Amen.
[6:00] And so then we see then that uh Paul
[6:03] here was praying that for the Ephesians
[6:06] church that they would be strengthened
[6:08] in the inner man that though the inner
[6:11] man would be in there in seed form that
[6:14] he was to be strengthened by the word.
[6:17] See the early church they just didn't
[6:20] come to Sunday uh because come on Sunday
[6:24] because they hear a sermon on Wednesday.
[6:27] They were spiritfilled
[6:30] every day. Word fed. Wordfilled every
[6:34] day. They had powers,
[6:37] visions,
[6:39] all kind of signs following wherever
[6:41] they were. But when they come together,
[6:44] it was an explosion.
[6:46] The prophets could get up and prophesy
[6:49] by the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. One by
[6:52] one. Amen. There was no written Bible
[6:55] for them. They they had a few scrolls if
[6:58] they had them because money because they
[7:00] to buy them. The ministers had them
[7:01] because no doubt of the Old Testament.
[7:04] But the Holy Spirit was there to take
[7:07] the Old Testament and reveal it out
[7:09] through sermons prophesies what the Old
[7:12] Testament meant in the New Testament.
[7:14] Amen. The Bible was written till years
[7:16] later. Are you beginning to follow me
[7:19] now, friends? They were spiritfilled.
[7:23] uh because more baptisms. That's right.
[7:26] They were be baptized again. Once again,
[7:28] they all come together and they were
[7:30] filled with the Holy Ghost again. Not
[7:32] just once, again. They were filled with
[7:35] the word of God. See,
[7:38] so to really see God working, you must
[7:42] have all the word and you must have the
[7:46] fullness of the spirit. And here was
[7:48] Paul praying that they would have be
[7:51] filled with the fullness.
[7:54] And we know that he was saying that
[7:57] if you're grounded and rooted in love,
[8:01] love is the soil.
[8:03] Amen.
[8:04] See, if that soil, that ground is love,
[8:09] then you can grow out of that love
[8:12] to be able to comprehend the breadth,
[8:15] the height, the depth of God. That you
[8:18] may be able to do that. But you got to
[8:20] be rooted and grounded in love. And love
[8:24] is Jesus. He was a great big bundle of
[8:28] love that God so loved the world, he
[8:31] sent him to us.
[8:33] That's what so now we may understand it.
[8:36] And uh his breath was boundless. The
[8:40] breath of him the length was endless.
[8:44] Amen. Endless. No way to measure that.
[8:48] The depth was because fathomless,
[8:51] exhaustless.
[8:52] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. The height
[8:57] measureless can't measure it. Praise
[9:00] God. I'm talking about my Lord.
[9:03] Amen. When you begin to talk about how
[9:05] great God is, the devil's got to leave.
[9:08] He's got to leave. Amen.
[9:11] It compasses the universe,
[9:14] time and eternity. The love of God.
[9:16] Amen. I heard one story that a man went
[9:20] insane on the uh wall of the crazy house
[9:25] trying to talk about the love of God.
[9:29] can't the minor snap to be able to
[9:32] measure God's love. Hallelujah. Cannot
[9:36] do it. Praise our God. How he loves us
[9:39] today. If we can only get a revelation
[9:42] that we've got a God that loves his
[9:45] bride. Amen. And you wouldn't fear.
[9:49] Peace be still. He can still all the
[9:52] fears, calm all the waves.
[9:56] Amen. Jesus, he can stop all the worries
[9:59] that build up pressure cuz pressure
[10:02] explodes. Amen. Just come into him, the
[10:06] word. Come in there and sit in there and
[10:08] stay in there. Don't want to go outside.
[10:10] Don't want something else. No other
[10:12] desires. Amen. Just hit the desire of
[10:15] Jesus, Christ on the inside seed form,
[10:19] pulsating in there.
[10:22] Amen. Inside. I feel him all the time.
[10:26] Does a mother to be feel a seat on the
[10:28] inside? A mother to be. I got the seat
[10:32] of God filled inside of me. And more is
[10:36] coming in all the time. Praying for the
[10:39] fullness of God. Somebody ask, do you
[10:41] feel anything? Sure, I feel something.
[10:42] It's pulsating.
[10:44] But it better compare with the word of
[10:46] God. I better dot every word with amen.
[10:49] Amen. The spirit that is feeling me the
[10:51] seed seed in there. I'm going to prove
[10:53] it this morning by the word of God.
[10:55] Amen. Praise our God.
[10:59] It reaches the love of God. It reaches
[11:02] down to the depth of sin. Amen. And
[11:05] filth and debauchery of whatever else he
[11:08] reached down to because to come down and
[11:10] get us. Amen. That's the love of God.
[11:14] Reach condescend himself to come down
[11:17] here. Amen. To pluck us out of the miry
[11:19] clay. He didn't have to do it, but he
[11:23] loved us. So loved the world. Praise
[11:25] God. I'm trying to build you up to a
[11:27] point. I'm trying to let the Holy Spirit
[11:30] take hold of the word and let you see
[11:34] why we should serve God. Why we should
[11:37] walk through fires, why we should obey
[11:39] every word, why we should love the
[11:41] brethren, not talk about them and
[11:44] slander them, but love them. Because he
[11:46] wouldn't do that. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[11:50] It passes all knowledge.
[11:53] Amen. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. The
[11:56] Pharisees were smart with knowledge and
[11:59] wisdom. But love come on the scene. Pass
[12:01] them. Their knowledge passed away. The
[12:05] fullness of love was standing there. He
[12:07] wasn't much to look at. Praise God. No
[12:09] beauty in him to be desired. But it was
[12:12] God's love. The arm of God being
[12:15] revealed. The love of God. But somebody
[12:18] saw it. And they caught hold of it.
[12:20] Peter, James, and John, the woman at the
[12:22] well, different one. Mary Magdalene,
[12:24] hallelujah. They saw Jesus Christ. They
[12:27] saw the love of God. Reaching down for
[12:30] them, and they took hold of it. They
[12:32] walked with him. Praise God. The word,
[12:35] keep my commandments. If you love me,
[12:39] then the father and I will come in and
[12:40] make our boat with you. We will manifest
[12:43] oursel to you. You'll know in that day.
[12:47] Somebody said, "Well, do you feel
[12:48] anything?" They felt something, brother.
[12:50] Well, they like tore off the roof up
[12:52] there.
[12:54] Away they went. Filled with the sperm of
[12:57] God. Sure they felt something. They was
[13:00] pulsating, screaming and holling like
[13:02] drunken people. But watch what they had
[13:04] in them came to. This is that word. This
[13:08] spirit that is pulsating is that word
[13:10] that the prophet Joel speak of. In the
[13:13] last days, I'll pour out my spirit for
[13:15] my sons and daughters. These are still
[13:18] the last days.
[13:20] He's still calling. Why? For his He
[13:24] hasn't left in judgment yet. His mercy
[13:27] here. There was a living testimony that
[13:31] was in the ark in heaven. The the
[13:33] emergency went over that testimony in
[13:35] there. The two tablets of stone, but it
[13:37] was living. A life was in there. That
[13:40] life came down here in a shout message.
[13:43] The capstone slipped on the earth. the
[13:46] cornerstone
[13:48] come down with strength, virtue,
[13:50] patience, the word. Praise God. Boy, I
[13:53] tell you, it just fills me up when I
[13:55] think about it. Amen. It passes all
[13:58] knowledge and wisdom.
[14:00] God's gift to man is the measure of his
[14:04] love.
[14:06] Think on it now. God's gift to man is
[14:09] the measure of his love. For God so
[14:13] loved the world that he gave his only
[14:14] begotten son that whosoever,
[14:18] anyone, Jew, Gentile, black, white,
[14:21] yellow, red, whosoever
[14:23] will let him come. Praise God. He'll
[14:26] not, he won't turn your way. Man will.
[14:28] You can't come in here because you can't
[14:30] be saved. But God so loved the world.
[14:33] Amen. Put some seeds down there. Amen.
[14:36] Amen. Just like in the beginning, the
[14:38] earth was seated, but it was darkness.
[14:40] The earth was void. Spirit of God moved
[14:43] up on the earth. Just moved. It couldn't
[14:46] do nothing because the word wasn't
[14:47] spoken yet. Amen. Come back to the word.
[14:51] But then the word said, "Let there be
[14:54] light." Then the spirit of the living
[14:56] God, love moved over the face of the
[14:59] earth and there was light. Now in light,
[15:04] then you can have some growth.
[15:07] Praise the Lord. Got to have light
[15:08] first. Amen. You going to have any
[15:10] growth at all throughout the life.
[15:12] Another time it moved. Seeds of God was
[15:15] laying down there. Peter and all them,
[15:16] John and them laying in old the old dark
[15:19] Jewish church void. Amen. And then the
[15:22] spirit of God move once again. The word
[15:25] came dove come down. Amen. And move once
[15:28] again and pull out those seeds. The
[15:31] third time today Leysian church dark boy
[15:34] void nothing. Pull out Christ. Amen.
[15:38] Amen. darkness pop because he blacked it
[15:41] out. Nothing down there, but he
[15:43] remembered.
[15:45] Amen. He had some seeds down there that
[15:49] he planted before the foundation of the
[15:51] world. He They were the ones who shouted
[15:54] and sang for joy before the foundation
[15:57] of the world. They were the ones bound
[15:59] and shackled and fettered in some church
[16:01] somewhere that something on their heart
[16:04] was beating. God, there's got to be
[16:06] something else other than this filth
[16:07] down here. Amen. Amen. Then that eagle
[16:09] comes screaming down there. Come on out
[16:12] of here. I've come down to get my
[16:14] elected ones. Amen. Praise our God. You
[16:19] talking about a love feast. Those
[16:21] elected ones who know where they come
[16:23] from.
[16:25] They were com because the the last day
[16:28] ones were compelled to come in. That
[16:31] word compel in the Greek means that
[16:33] conditions will be so terrible that
[16:35] they'll run in. Thank you, Lord. Hold on
[16:39] to the horns of the altar there and
[16:41] scream for mercy in there. Crying sigh
[16:45] against the abomination done in the city
[16:46] in there. The love of God. Hallelujah.
[16:50] Praise our God. God's gift to man is the
[16:53] measure of his love.
[16:55] The death of Christ is the measure of
[16:58] his love. Now think about the measure of
[17:03] God's love. Almighty God who didn't have
[17:05] to do it come down and took on another
[17:09] form. Man,
[17:11] he paid the price. God himself. There's
[17:14] the love of God. Think about it friends.
[17:18] God himself paying the price. then
[17:21] condescending
[17:23] to send the Holy Spirit himself to
[17:26] transform us into nothing into sons and
[17:30] daughters of God. Amen. And to work in
[17:34] our lives the measure of the spirit of
[17:38] the love of the spirit to man.
[17:41] Working in our lives justification,
[17:43] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[17:46] Ghost to clean out Satan.
[17:49] Amen. I let it sink into you. Satan,
[17:52] he's unbelief. Baptism purges him with
[17:54] fire, burns him out. That little seed
[17:58] lays out there on the floor at the altar
[18:00] like he said. Amen. He knows ain't
[18:04] enough devils in hell to tell him he
[18:07] wasn't born again.
[18:09] By another spirit,
[18:11] there's something in him beating in
[18:13] there. The seat of God is in there.
[18:16] Hallelujah. Hitting that sh But it ain't
[18:20] the full seed life yet. That's to come
[18:22] in the fourth stage. So sayeth the
[18:25] prophet, the message which Doug tells
[18:27] with the word. Amen. Bring the word and
[18:30] the message together. And then man today
[18:33] would go around teaching, taking away
[18:35] the third step, bring you back to a
[18:37] second step. I'm preaching this morning
[18:39] when the love of God, the seed of me,
[18:41] boils over to think man would take his
[18:44] filthy hands and put it on the word of
[18:46] God in the end time after the prophet's
[18:48] gone. Sneaky. Wait till he's gone and
[18:51] then come out try to begile the sheep
[18:54] begotten to God. What is he going to do
[18:56] to them? Then people go into that
[18:58] presence in there. It's all right. Well,
[19:00] they looking for the fullness. They are.
[19:02] Huh? Devils
[19:04] anointed with a wrong teaching.
[19:08] So sly, so slick.
[19:11] Eve got on that ground. That's it. Don't
[19:14] you get on the ground. Don't even
[19:17] fellowship with them. Amen. Telling you
[19:19] the word of God. Avoid them, said Paul.
[19:22] Amen. Yet they go and let them in their
[19:25] homes and fellowship with them. Go
[19:26] there, come back. What spirit is doing
[19:29] it in you? The love of God. Do you love
[19:32] God for the word? What he did for you?
[19:34] you a fellowship with the serpent.
[19:37] That's what it says. That's the word of
[19:39] God.
[19:41] Praise our God. Amen.
[19:45] We who are called to be his bride
[19:49] have experienced
[19:51] the measure of the love of God. They
[19:55] don't know what it is, but we know what
[19:57] it is.
[19:59] God is working in our lives.
[20:03] Not because we are circumcised or
[20:06] uncircumcised.
[20:07] Because he loves us. Not because we
[20:10] could do or or have faith to move all
[20:13] mountains,
[20:14] know all prophecies, have all No.
[20:18] Because he so loved the world. He sent
[20:20] his only begotten son.
[20:23] Praise our God. Yes, sir. So, he's
[20:27] working in our lives because he loves
[20:29] us.
[20:32] May that sink onto you. The creator, the
[20:36] almighty God
[20:39] through almighty meekness
[20:42] condensing sin to come down to these
[20:45] filthy cucker birds.
[20:47] Clean us up. Wash us by the water of the
[20:49] word. The blood, the bleeding word.
[20:52] Hallelujah. Dripping bleeding word. Wash
[20:55] our sins away. Amen. Thank we are
[20:58] justified now. We are blameless now.
[21:01] Right now, we can come boldly to the
[21:04] throne of grace.
[21:06] Oh, praise God. And when we get there,
[21:10] God is willing. He is more willing than
[21:13] what we think he is. The scripture saith
[21:17] Ephesians 3:20 that God is able to do
[21:20] abundantly
[21:22] above all
[21:24] that we can even think of. Hallelujah.
[21:26] That we can even dream up. Amen. Amen.
[21:29] He'll do it by his love above that.
[21:33] All that you can ask for.
[21:37] All that you can ask for. He will do
[21:40] super abundantly
[21:43] for a super church with super love with
[21:47] the super word.
[21:49] With super faith.
[21:52] Praise our God. He knows what you need.
[21:55] Amen. David had understanding of it. He
[21:59] desired a drink of water. Praise God.
[22:03] Amen. His type of Christ, his servants
[22:07] cut their way through 15 miles of
[22:09] Philistines to get him some water. When
[22:12] he got back, he wasn't worthy. Poured it
[22:14] on the ground, drink off into God. We
[22:16] are not worthy for nothing.
[22:19] Amen. We are not worthy. My desire, God,
[22:23] your desire. Your will be done, not my
[22:26] will.
[22:28] I had a will here to take a vacation.
[22:31] God, he put up a roadblock. I remembered
[22:34] the word. So, I took heed to the
[22:36] roadblock because soon he would have a
[22:38] jackass speak to me. Lord, praise God. I
[22:41] caught it the first time by his grace.
[22:43] So, I stayed put
[22:46] to and I know it was a love of God.
[22:49] That's what he wanted and that's where I
[22:51] wanted to be at in his will. Amen.
[22:55] Praise God. I could be in his permissive
[22:57] will and get blessed. Sure. Bum was and
[23:00] the rest of them were. But he wants
[23:02] somebody who was in that perfect will.
[23:06] That that his uh uh desire is their
[23:10] command.
[23:11] Amen. Command. He said, "If you love me,
[23:16] keep my commandments. Keep my sayings.
[23:20] Keep my word." Amen. Amen. Then when
[23:22] you've done it for a while, we'll take
[23:25] up our bone and manifest ourel to you.
[23:29] The seed that's in you that you have the
[23:31] the love in in minor form, but you know
[23:34] it's there. You get mad sometime. See,
[23:37] you confess, but something in you makes
[23:40] you go back and repent. I'm sorry,
[23:41] brother. Sorry, sister. That's God in
[23:45] there. The seed form. But there's coming
[23:47] a day when that love will blanket you.
[23:51] The outer god bind it all together. Like
[23:54] you saw the prophet, you saw love
[23:56] walking. Amen. Amen. You saw love
[23:59] walking on two feet. Charity come down.
[24:02] He put it on. We're growing into it.
[24:06] Amen. Praise our God.
[24:09] God is working in our lives. If I stop
[24:12] preaching now because he loves us, not
[24:16] because he's supposed to, not because we
[24:19] were good or we were righteous,
[24:23] there was none righteous. All had on
[24:26] filthy rags.
[24:27] All like sheep had gone astray. Amen.
[24:30] But with tender love, with his rod, the
[24:32] word, he brings you back into the way.
[24:35] You are already sheep.
[24:39] You just didn't become a sheep now. You
[24:41] were sheep before the foundation of the
[24:42] world. To prove it, you heard the
[24:45] shepherd's voice and you came into the
[24:47] fold. Praise our God.
[24:51] He said, "If you love me," say, "If you
[24:54] love me, keep my word, keep my
[24:58] commandments,
[25:00] then all that we could ever do for God
[25:03] must come by love."
[25:06] That's what I'm trying to get you to see
[25:07] this morning. Then if it's obedience,
[25:11] it won't be because I told you to obey.
[25:14] Is that because you can't wait to obey
[25:17] for the love of God? You're just
[25:20] pulsating.
[25:22] Yes, father. This morning, what is your
[25:23] worry? What shall I do? What is your
[25:26] com? What is your desire? Is my command?
[25:28] That's the bride.
[25:30] She's waiting this morning to hear the
[25:32] word of God. To obey full obedience. She
[25:36] don't have to be herded into like goats.
[25:38] See, she just loving in her heart welled
[25:41] up in there to obey the word of God.
[25:44] Amen. Praise God. Then all that we can
[25:47] do for God, it must not be because
[25:51] brother Hun and I asked you to do it.
[25:56] Hope you get that. Don't sit here now
[25:58] because you say because we your pastor.
[26:01] Sit here I mean be righteous. sit here
[26:04] because you believe we preaching the
[26:05] truth
[26:07] and you love the brethren,
[26:09] the sisters. That's why you sit here.
[26:12] But don't sit here because there's
[26:13] because no place to go. There's plenty
[26:16] of places to go. Faith workketh by love.
[26:22] On the token message, it says full
[26:23] obedience to the whole word of God will
[26:26] entitle you to the token.
[26:28] Full obedience, not part of it as far as
[26:31] your denomination goes, but all of it.
[26:34] Full obedience to the word, which is
[26:36] Christ, brings you into Christ. He's
[26:40] love. So, you walk right into the love
[26:42] of God in the end time here. We're
[26:45] walking right into it. We're in it. The
[26:48] ark come down. And in the ark was a
[26:50] testimony. Inside was the the person of
[26:53] the son of man. He was in the ark
[26:56] standing outside Leosa. Come out. Come
[26:59] out. Come out. When you got in there, it
[27:02] was love. Cuz you realize you see the
[27:05] these people out here going insane. Is
[27:08] that right?
[27:10] Insane in the natural. In the church,
[27:12] their spirits are going insane also. The
[27:15] mind, their conscience is sealed with a
[27:17] hot iron. The Pentecostals and so forth
[27:19] don't even know because right from
[27:21] wrong. That right type see natural
[27:24] spiritual then you realize that he
[27:27] clothe you in your right mind
[27:31] by putting on the new man. Amen. Put on
[27:35] the new man. Put on the garment. Put it
[27:38] on. That's another person. Amen. Paul
[27:43] told us that everything we'll do outside
[27:47] of this love will fail. Amen. Amen.
[27:51] Amen. Amen. Amen. Let us take care now.
[27:54] Can I read it to you? What he said?
[27:57] Everything you could do. Praise our God.
[28:01] Outside of the love in your heart for
[28:04] God,
[28:06] it means nothing. For he said, "Though I
[28:09] speak with the tongues of men and angels
[28:11] and have not charity, I am become
[28:13] sounding brass." Amen.
[28:16] Or a tingling symbol. And though I have
[28:19] the gift of prophecy and understand all
[28:22] seven seal mysteries,
[28:25] come on now. Though I understand all
[28:29] mysteries. Well, who unveiled the
[28:31] mysteries? The prophet of God. And
[28:34] there's those in the message now
[28:36] understand all the mysteries.
[28:38] Know all about the pope and all these
[28:40] things here. The future home and the
[28:42] brine serpent. All the mysteries. Amen.
[28:46] That don't mean nothing.
[28:48] They can have 1,033
[28:50] tapes because I think it's supposed to
[28:52] be about that memory. That still doesn't
[28:54] mean anything without charity, without
[28:57] being rooted, grounded in the love of
[29:00] God. Hallelujah. Paul Peter said,
[29:02] "Loving one another fervently."
[29:06] Perfectly. Amen. Being born again by not
[29:09] by corruptible, incorruptible seed. What
[29:13] is the seed word of God?
[29:16] When is it in you? In the third stage,
[29:19] the shock stage, not the fourth, the
[29:21] fourth, the whole thing is is the word.
[29:23] Amen. Watch it. The outside body becomes
[29:26] the word because the word lives in the
[29:27] flesh. Amen. Amen. Don't let it pass
[29:30] over your head now. Amen. In the shock
[29:32] stage, the seed is way a little small
[29:34] like way in the heart. That's now. But
[29:36] see, it's growing out. The the word is
[29:38] taking over the whole body. The body,
[29:41] the flesh is becoming the word. Walking
[29:44] in love.
[29:47] The bells around the outer garment
[29:50] playing a sweet melody in love. Amen.
[29:54] Are bathed down with perfume of the rose
[29:57] of Sharon and lily of the valley. Yes,
[30:00] my lord. Walking in love and the bells
[30:03] of flame. Praise God. The German thumb
[30:06] is lit up
[30:08] all over. The devil flies against it.
[30:10] Cuts out.
[30:13] He sees it sparkling there. where on
[30:16] your breast, the breast is beating out
[30:18] the love of God. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[30:23] So he says, "And though I have the gift
[30:25] of prophecy and understand all mysteries
[30:27] and all knowledge, and though I have all
[30:30] faith, see all faith, so that I could
[30:34] remove mountains and have not charity, I
[30:36] am nothing. Though I give my goods to
[30:38] the poor, though I give my body to be
[30:40] burned and have not charity, it profits
[30:41] me nothing." Now watch faith. faith.
[30:45] There's a gift of faith. Amen. And then
[30:48] there's faith through receive.
[30:51] Amen. Amen.
[30:54] Let it sink into you. We see a lot of
[30:56] bulldozers out there. Glory to God.
[30:58] Jesus name with faith out there doing
[31:00] all kind of things out there. It's a
[31:01] gift of faith, gifts, and calling of
[31:02] God's will and repentance.
[31:05] So right now, there's plenty of people
[31:06] right now say, "Well, ain't nobody got
[31:08] nothing now because I don't see no signs
[31:10] of wonders and miracles. I don't see the
[31:12] powers of God moving. I don't see that
[31:14] faith. Well, you could have that and
[31:16] still be lost. But if he planted because
[31:20] of love a seed in your heart a seed of
[31:25] love in there, that seed of love is
[31:27] right now growing, ripening, maturing
[31:32] into uh Galatians 5:22.
[31:36] And in the fruit of the spirit is faith.
[31:40] So the little person sitting down here
[31:41] will know and they want to have faith
[31:43] too cuz it's a fruit of the spirit. The
[31:47] man may stand up there with a gift of
[31:49] faith to preach to you on like but you
[31:51] got a seed growing in you that's going
[31:53] to produce faith and that'll be your
[31:55] rapture faith. You going to have it and
[31:57] can't nobody take it away from you. It
[32:00] can't no false devil come up to you with
[32:02] some kind of crazy doctrine. Look at
[32:04] here brother. Get away from me cuz you
[32:06] serpent you. See, that's right. Cuz you
[32:10] will you'll know. He which is perfect
[32:12] has come. You'll know all things. You
[32:13] know now. See, and you're going right on
[32:15] into it. Knowledge is coming in every
[32:17] day. You see? But there's still some
[32:21] thunders hanging out there that he's
[32:23] going to reveal to you. He's going to do
[32:24] it. Amen. See, so now we see then that
[32:28] faith cometh by hearing. Luther, Wesley,
[32:33] they heard faith come by hearing. They
[32:35] were saved. Amen. See, and faith is also
[32:38] planted though. But now you cannot get
[32:41] this rapturing faith unless that is
[32:43] planted there by a seed. Holy Spirit is
[32:46] seed. And the spirit of God must bring
[32:49] that fruit of the spirit. The faith of
[32:51] the spirit. The spirit of God must do it
[32:53] in se must be in seed form to do it
[32:55] with. You can have a gift and don't have
[32:58] it in there. That'll pass away. Amen.
[33:02] See, Paul said so. You can have such a
[33:05] faith because could it could move a
[33:07] mountain but if they ain't grounded in
[33:10] love amen pass away don't mean a thing.
[33:14] Amen.
[33:15] So we see then that love is the soil
[33:19] which we must grow in speaking the truth
[33:22] in love. In love grow up unto him in
[33:26] love. Speaking the truth living the
[33:28] truth because one to another. For God is
[33:31] able. I think here can Ephesians over
[33:34] here it says 3:20. Now unto him that's
[33:38] able to do exceedingly abundantly above
[33:40] all that we ask or think according to
[33:44] the power that workketh in us. Now he
[33:49] can only do all these things according
[33:52] to what's in you. The power that is
[33:55] working in you. But many would come in
[33:58] the last days denying the power
[34:02] from such turn away the power the
[34:05] revelation in you as to who Jesus Christ
[34:07] is who is the prophet and all these
[34:09] things that power is there that power
[34:11] strengthens you when the revelation
[34:12] comes but they don't have the revelation
[34:15] there it is so if they don't have it
[34:20] you down there you surely can't have it
[34:21] if I haven't got it we heard that before
[34:25] you get what I mean now if me with all
[34:28] my great ministry and all these things
[34:29] if I don't understand it how in the
[34:31] world can you understand? I'm the one
[34:33] that's called and also ordained with a
[34:35] great ministry. You know what I'm
[34:36] talking about? How can they understand
[34:38] anything there? Well, and God's able of
[34:41] these stones to raise children under
[34:43] Abraham.
[34:45] Is that right? Amen. He told the church
[34:48] today, he said, "The South is mixed up
[34:50] on the seed of the serpent."
[34:53] They thought about it. They didn't know
[34:55] what he said. He ain't talking about the
[34:57] South Natural down there cuz they're not
[34:59] even saved.
[35:01] Who listened to his message? You find
[35:02] out who he talking to.
[35:05] So they all waiting. Where his message
[35:07] at? Who got the notes? So we can see.
[35:11] Praise the Lord. Now, what is this power
[35:14] that Paul says is working in us? That's
[35:18] God's love in seed form. And the word is
[35:22] a seed. And the word is part of God.
[35:25] Therefore, there's a part of God in you
[35:27] in seed form. Amen. That right. Well,
[35:30] that that word in there is power.
[35:33] All it needs is some water. Amen. Amen.
[35:36] It'll begin to work. It'll begin to
[35:38] bring forth what he said it'll do. He
[35:41] planted it. I the Lord planted. I the
[35:43] Lord shall water it. It'll bring forth.
[35:45] Praise God.
[35:47] Now, a couple of scriptures you want if
[35:48] you want to write it down. Ephesians
[35:49] 4:24.
[35:51] I just want to lay a background here and
[35:53] then finish up. and that you put on the
[35:55] new man, if you want to write it down,
[35:57] which after God is created in
[36:00] righteousness and true holiness. So if
[36:03] you want to see a person who's doing
[36:05] righteousness and also holiness, well,
[36:08] there's a new creation in them. See that
[36:11] is because uh because created after
[36:12] holiness and so forth and righteousness
[36:15] also Colossians 3:10 if you want to
[36:17] write it down
[36:19] and have put on the new man which is
[36:22] renewed in knowledge after the image of
[36:26] him that created him. So this new man
[36:29] the seed in your little seed like this
[36:31] here is renewed day by day. And so Paul
[36:34] said, "I travail in birth again because
[36:37] in labor that Christ might be formed in
[36:40] you." So God's prophet brings on birth
[36:43] pains. Amen. That's what he said. A
[36:46] prophet brings on birth pains. So
[36:48] therefore, he's laboring that Christ
[36:51] will be formed in you, bringing forth
[36:53] the seed word coming into your spiritual
[36:55] wounds. And then Christ is being formed.
[36:58] That seed is growing through the shock
[37:00] body. Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise God.
[37:04] So this new man is another nature,
[37:07] another person, a new man, a new
[37:10] creation. Peter says, being born again
[37:12] by the word of God, the seed of God.
[37:15] Amen. Then our faith will work by the
[37:19] love of God that he shed abroad in our
[37:22] hearts. He put a love in there for the
[37:24] word. You follow me now? By the Holy
[37:27] Spirit. And the Holy Spirit in your
[37:29] heart loves God, the word.
[37:32] And it it wants to do all that it can
[37:35] for the love of God is in the heart. So
[37:38] therefore, it has faith because it loves
[37:41] the word. It has faith because it loves
[37:44] his loves the tapes. Love it. It don't
[37:46] want to break nothing. Don't want to be
[37:48] seen nowhere with anybody who's funny
[37:52] there to pray for them. And if they have
[37:54] to run into them, well, praise the Lord.
[37:56] Stay talk around long enough and then
[37:58] just move away. See, but you don't want
[38:00] to stand around there cuz unbelief and
[38:03] unbelief kills you. You go home, you
[38:05] feel funny the next day. You know what
[38:07] I'm talking about. If you ever been in
[38:08] somebody unbelief and you fellowship
[38:10] there, the next day you got a headache
[38:12] and everything else. Praise the Lord.
[38:15] Abraham
[38:17] uh uh uh uh James wrote that uh works
[38:21] without faith is dead. So therefore,
[38:24] Abraham worked his faith by his love for
[38:29] God because Abraham loved God more than
[38:32] Isaac. Is that right? Because he loved
[38:36] God, he gave up Isaac,
[38:39] but he had a revelation. Didn't matter
[38:42] if he killed him coming back again
[38:43] anyway. It's all right. So no matter
[38:46] what we do, we go to death. That's why
[38:48] Peter wanted to be because med upside
[38:50] down. He raised in the last days.
[38:54] Wanted to identify himself with Jesus on
[38:56] the cross. Paul and all of them. Paul
[38:58] was bound to it. Couldn't keep him away
[39:01] from it. Amen. My course is finished. He
[39:04] says, "Crown's laid up for me. He's on
[39:06] his way to it." So he knew. See, there's
[39:09] something in the heart that's pulsating
[39:10] in there and can't nobody stop him. So
[39:13] therefore, Abraham's faith worked by the
[39:16] by the love of God in his heart. He
[39:18] loved God. See? So therefore, what about
[39:21] us and also our desires? What should it
[39:24] be? We don't have to come here because
[39:26] we're supposed to come here, but we come
[39:28] here because we love God. Amen. We love
[39:32] the brethren. We want to be together.
[39:34] And we can't make nobody do anything for
[39:37] anybody. I'm so happy to see these
[39:41] people in here to to see y'all going
[39:42] around to the sick, the old ones, and so
[39:44] forth. that makes us feel wonderful
[39:47] because we know that we swed that seed
[39:49] and many before say well so and so don't
[39:51] visit me and but we can't do anything
[39:53] about it we got to wait on God until the
[39:56] love of God gets in that person's heart
[39:58] amen for that they themselves will go
[40:01] out for the love of God in their heart
[40:04] for the brethren sisters then is it's
[40:07] not brother hunt brother Coleman tell
[40:09] them you get over to so and so's house
[40:11] and you can you go over there and you go
[40:12] over there and somebody come well they
[40:14] didn't come to see Well, okay. Just call
[40:15] up a minute and we get because they're
[40:17] going to see you. See amen now. The
[40:19] people here, there's people in here. God
[40:21] sees that. Amen. God sees that. Going to
[40:24] these ones here. God sees everything.
[40:26] Your labor of love. That's what Paul
[40:28] said. Ain't that right? Work of faith
[40:30] and a labor of love. And God's writing
[40:32] it all down in a book. Amen. What is it?
[40:36] Gold, silver, precious stone laying on
[40:39] the foundation of love. Hallelujah.
[40:42] building up to the statue of a perfect
[40:44] man the love of God. It's your love for
[40:48] these people here one for the other.
[40:50] Paul appears said do that. Paul said put
[40:53] on that love. Put it on. So now work of
[40:57] live. That was living faith that they
[40:59] had there. And a living faith is fruit.
[41:02] You see it. Amen. Praise God. You love
[41:06] him. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. How
[41:09] are we strengthened? by his spirit in
[41:13] the inner man. See with me now the
[41:16] spirit of truth, the Holy Spirit. People
[41:20] that can't understand that many are
[41:22] confused about the message.
[41:24] Well,
[41:26] Ephesians 3:20, according to the power
[41:29] working in us, according to the power
[41:32] us, God is able to mold sons and
[41:34] daughters into God. Now, how does he do
[41:37] it? God does it by the spirit of his
[41:40] word.
[41:42] He plants his seed, throws his spirit
[41:45] upon it, and brings forth the product.
[41:47] Brings it forth. See,
[41:50] his holy spirit
[41:53] transforms the seed word to be
[41:56] vindicated of its kind.
[41:59] Now whatever kind of seed is in the
[42:02] heart the Holy Spirit was to come later
[42:05] rain and throw upon it in the same field
[42:09] weeds and tears and chaff and wheat and
[42:12] whatever's in the heart that's the only
[42:15] thing that can come out on the outside.
[42:18] So therefore the life in the seed meets
[42:20] the life of the spirit. But if the life
[42:24] in the seed is love in seed form and
[42:29] when it meets this full token, amen,
[42:33] full token life that has come down here
[42:36] now to apply it, you apply that to
[42:40] what's in the heart, then it'll
[42:42] transform it into a son and daughter of
[42:44] God. You won't have to ask a sister to
[42:46] accept you because stop cutting the hair
[42:47] and all these things here. The love of
[42:49] God, brother. Amen. It'll be the inner
[42:52] man in her heart is beating in there.
[42:54] She want to please her Lord. Amen. You
[42:56] won't have to ask them to lower their
[42:58] addresses down. Anything like I said,
[43:00] they'll do it for the love of God. You
[43:03] won't have to ask the brethren to be
[43:05] real brothers one another. They'll do it
[43:06] for the love of God. That's a real
[43:09] church. That's what a God's prophet wife
[43:11] said she that because she sees up here
[43:14] has the best spirit. She says in the
[43:15] whole message what she said prophet one.
[43:18] What she said. See, and so we praise
[43:21] God, but because not us, but I'm happy
[43:24] to be associated with you.
[43:27] I'm happy to unite faith with faith and
[43:31] stand in this rot gut city here as a
[43:34] testimony. Amen. I stood here for the
[43:38] love of God in my heart. I wouldn't move
[43:40] nowhere.
[43:43] They can go to the east, they can go to
[43:45] the west, they can go to the south, go
[43:47] to the north, but the love of God
[43:49] constrains me to hold on. He says, "I
[43:53] got to work for you a little while
[43:55] longer there. Hold still down there."
[43:58] Amen. Praise the Lord. So we'll hold
[44:01] still.
[44:03] The Philistines is ravaging the people
[44:06] up and down the byways.
[44:08] Amen. But we got faith. Amen. We got our
[44:11] ox code. Amen. And by faith, we have
[44:15] beat them off of the byways and the
[44:17] highways.
[44:19] Amen. Calling Jesus on the scene. Amen.
[44:22] He's there. Remember, he was right there
[44:24] in the boat. They had to ask for him,
[44:26] though. Amen. Ask for Jesus and he'll
[44:30] come on the scene. Amen. He was back
[44:32] there taking a nap.
[44:35] He's right here right now. Amen. His
[44:38] presence is over us right now. Is in us,
[44:42] moving through, brooding up over us,
[44:45] bringing us forth. Why? His love for his
[44:49] people.
[44:51] So the Holy Spirit transforms the life
[44:54] in your heart into a seed of God. Seed
[44:58] itself. See, they can only get that
[45:00] there. The seed word grain itself. We
[45:04] were shocked when we come out of
[45:06] Leodysa. But now the grains opening up
[45:08] and you begin to see that it's the whole
[45:10] grain. That grain itself is you. The
[45:15] grain itself. Amen. Praise God. I'mma
[45:18] prove it to you. Have a little something
[45:19] right here in closing. Praise the Lord.
[45:22] So now, Holy Spirit transforms a seed
[45:25] that's on the inside of it. No matter
[45:27] what kind, he will transform it.
[45:30] So God threw a seed or attribute of his
[45:32] word. There's only one thing that can
[45:35] quicken the word that is the Holy
[45:36] Spirit.
[45:38] Nothing else won't do it. See now it is
[45:40] the lifegiver to the word. And when the
[45:42] life in the sea meets the life in the
[45:45] word then you see something happen
[45:47] spontaneous because combustion. Amen.
[45:51] Now the spirit rain gives life to the
[45:54] weed to tear to shuck all of it. See? So
[45:59] God took before he could get the real
[46:02] green life out into the harvest, he took
[46:06] it through three steps, three stages,
[46:09] three processes.
[46:11] The world passed through three same
[46:14] steps. A woman passes through three,
[46:17] bringeth forth life. The wheat goes
[46:19] through three. And we going to come
[46:21] through three. But yet there are men
[46:25] around this area and across the country
[46:27] who says no, you're not going to come
[46:29] through three because you're in the
[46:30] second one right now. They took you out
[46:32] of the third one and put you back in the
[46:34] second one because you got
[46:35] sanctification now and you have the
[46:37] spirit in the measure and you're waiting
[46:39] for the fullness. That ain't what God's
[46:41] prophet said. Sure ain't. So therefore,
[46:45] I have something here to read for you.
[46:48] Uh future home and the bride.
[46:51] This is after 63.
[46:54] So I said, "Well, that was before, you
[46:55] know, because you don't understand it's
[46:56] the word now." Well, we say we have
[46:58] we'll see what he said about the word
[46:59] now. After 63,
[47:01] let me see page 17. Do you love them?
[47:05] Prove all things. Amen. By the message
[47:07] dovetailing with the word. See, uh this
[47:10] is I'm reading from page 17
[47:14] now. Uh
[47:16] well, uh I pick it up here. He says um
[47:20] um and now and notice just exactly how
[47:23] that comes. No, a man can repent of sin.
[47:26] He's still thinking of well maybe he's a
[47:28] because immoral man every immoral
[47:30] looking woman he finds is still there.
[47:32] Maybe he's a drunken every time he
[47:33] smells a drink is still there. See, but
[47:35] then he gets sanctified that cleanses
[47:38] that desire out of him. See, it takes
[47:40] the want of it away. He can still be
[47:42] tempted, but it takes the want of it
[47:44] away. Still, he's not right yet. Then he
[47:47] is baptized with the Holy Ghost and
[47:49] fire. This was in 64. Cleansed, burnt
[47:53] out, cleaned up, and then put into
[47:55] service of God. Sanctification only sets
[47:59] aside for service. And notice just
[48:02] exactly how that comes. The message is
[48:04] coming. Luther justification, westerly
[48:06] sanctification, Pentecostals, the
[48:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost. The messages.
[48:11] That's so where there can't be no more
[48:13] ages of it. See, we at the end time,
[48:15] three stages. Baptism cleanses the heart
[48:17] with the Holy Ghost. How striking. Now
[48:20] he takes the place where we are to dwell
[48:22] in through the same process. He's called
[48:24] the church through justification. Called
[48:26] it through sanctification. Then filled
[48:28] it with the Holy Ghost and fire. And he
[48:30] took himself through a process. He
[48:32] himself the Holy Spirit. They can't get
[48:34] that. He himself is the Holy Spirit, the
[48:37] love. But he baptized your heart with
[48:40] his spirit to burn it out that he could
[48:43] come down. was in seed form in there.
[48:46] Then he comes down with the word. Then
[48:48] that seed in there takes on the word.
[48:50] Takes on the word. He as himself. A
[48:52] man's word. He is as good as his word.
[48:55] So what is G? He sends his word down by
[48:57] only one person. A prophet. He says, "I
[49:00] want you." And the prophet speaks it
[49:02] out. That's his word. Then he himself
[49:04] comes down and manifests himself to you
[49:06] personally. He said he would do it.
[49:09] Well, he said here. Amen. Praise the
[49:11] Lord. his own very life, self, signs,
[49:14] wonders, powers, he'll do it himself in
[49:17] season. Amen. See, so now um page 23
[49:24] um
[49:26] yes, Satan was will be taken from the
[49:29] earth just exactly like Satan was taken
[49:32] from you now. Amen. Let it sink in now.
[49:37] Satan will be taken from the earth just
[49:39] exactly like Satan was taken from you.
[49:44] Satan cannot bother. He can tempt but he
[49:47] cannot get a born again Christian for
[49:49] God from the foundation of the world
[49:50] foresaw and sent Jesus to redeem him.
[49:53] And the blood speaks for him. How can he
[49:55] sin when he can't even be seen by God?
[49:57] And today they'll come and tell you that
[49:59] you don't have that. They've said it.
[50:02] Brother told me on the phone you haven't
[50:03] got that. Well, maybe he hasn't got it.
[50:06] But uh I know what I have. Praise the
[50:08] Lord. I'm persuaded. Ain't nobody going
[50:10] to take it away from me either.
[50:13] Amen. Against that day. That's right.
[50:16] And but you see now here is again I just
[50:18] want to say to you saints so you
[50:19] understand it. The baptism of fire watch
[50:22] now on it only is to cleanse it. I hope
[50:28] you're getting that now. He sends a
[50:30] baptism of fire to cleanse out the heart
[50:32] to take Satan out. Because
[50:35] sanctification, Satan's still in there.
[50:38] Now, he told you that. But when he says
[50:40] the fire, the dove comes in and a little
[50:43] seed in the third stage.
[50:46] This is what the prophet taught.
[50:49] See, the baptism of fire on it only is
[50:52] to cleanse it and make it a fit place
[50:54] for his meek to live in. See? Oh, like
[50:58] he did us. So therefore, he takes Satan
[51:01] off of the the new millennium kingdom.
[51:03] Takes him away, binds him up, then the
[51:05] meat can live there. As long as he's
[51:07] there because to influence them, but he
[51:09] takes him away. And then everything is
[51:12] righteousness. So then therefore a
[51:14] Christian stumble around, he the elected
[51:17] one, he takes him out of your heart. He
[51:20] can't get in there. He's out. Burned
[51:22] out. Amen. Amen. Praise God. See, before
[51:27] he could could come in, he had to give
[51:29] us the baptism of fire. Then the Holy
[51:32] Ghost come in and live, dwells in there.
[51:36] Let Christ dwell in your heart by faith.
[51:40] Amen. Praise the Lord. Do you love him?
[51:43] Amen. Well, one more. Resurrection of
[51:48] the brat 876. The fourth light is to
[51:52] come that will bring forth the same
[51:53] signs. person told me, "Well, right now,
[51:57] if you have the Holy Ghost, why don't
[51:59] you have the signs?" Well, I'm in the
[52:00] third stage, and I'm growing into the
[52:03] fourth stage. But he said, "The fourth
[52:04] stage is to bring that the fourth
[52:06] stage." Cuz see, the Pentecost with the
[52:09] baptism was the leaves wasn't the fruit
[52:12] yet. And the fruit up on the top of the
[52:14] tree. And it shall be light about the
[52:16] evening time to ripen the top of the
[52:19] tree with the fruit in the top. It's
[52:20] four stages. And they all gummed up.
[52:23] They're trying to figure the early
[52:24] church with this church and they can't
[52:26] they can't get it. And they want signs
[52:27] and wonders America. I'm going to show
[52:29] you by this here why you cannot have it
[52:31] right now. It's against God's nature to
[52:34] have it right now. How can you have it
[52:37] when the full life is not there yet? The
[52:39] full nature is not there yet. How you
[52:40] going to have it? But they want anyway
[52:42] and they blast anybody who's saved
[52:44] because they got the Holy Ghost. See?
[52:47] Okay. Watch. Justification brought back
[52:50] the pop. Sanctification brought back the
[52:51] bar. Doctrine of holiness. What brought
[52:54] back the leaf? Pentecostal. What is the
[52:56] Pentecostal leaves? Because clap the
[52:58] hands. Joy, rejoicing. Pentecostal.
[52:59] What? The fourth was the word itself.
[53:03] The word made flesh. Fruits of the
[53:05] fruits of the resurrection sign that
[53:07] Christ has finally after justification
[53:09] been planted, sanctification been
[53:12] planted, baptism of Holy Ghost,
[53:14] organizations died out. See Galatosa
[53:17] Christ has again centered himself like
[53:20] the cap on the earth. The capstone has
[53:23] come down love. I hope you get that. And
[53:27] you walking into the baptism of the Holy
[53:29] Ghost and in there is all the mechanics
[53:32] of what he really is. Take a car because
[53:35] take it apart. While the prophet has
[53:37] taken apart the word for you to let you
[53:39] see every part of the Holy Ghost. It'll
[53:42] do this. Amen. It'll do that. It just
[53:46] won't shout and speak in tongue. It'll
[53:47] do everything else. Amen. Love and peace
[53:49] and joy, everything from Genesis all the
[53:52] way through Revelation. So, the master
[53:54] mechanic, the prophet has taken apart
[53:56] the Holy Ghost to show you what it
[53:57] really is. That's what he's done. The
[54:00] mechanics of it, that's all you're
[54:01] seeing right now. You follow me,
[54:03] friends?
[54:05] First line, justification,
[54:06] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[54:08] Ghost, then coming of the camp. What is
[54:10] it? That holy ghost bunch, prophet's
[54:13] words, don't don't take away from it
[54:15] now. Holy Ghost bunch being honed out by
[54:20] what? Virtue, patience, honing it out.
[54:23] Temperance. Who is it? Stones is being
[54:26] cut. Glory to God. The stones is being
[54:30] cut here in New York, Puerto Rico,
[54:32] Europe, Africa by what? Holy Spirit
[54:35] tutor. The word, the message honing out
[54:37] that bunch. See, because at the top each
[54:40] stone must fit for the Cathol to just to
[54:43] blend right in into each other. Same
[54:45] ministry, same sign, same power. Not now
[54:49] then when divine love caps it off. See,
[54:53] but they all gummed up there.
[54:54] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Wait
[54:55] a sign. What is the miracles? Well, St.
[54:57] John 6:14 said they followed him for the
[55:00] miracles.
[55:02] But the woman at the well followed him.
[55:04] She said, "Come see a man who told me
[55:06] all things." Amen. Amen. See the
[55:09] different spirit. There two spirits
[55:10] right there. One spirit is working right
[55:12] now for signs, wonders, and miracles.
[55:14] Glory to God. And we got love here. We
[55:16] love everybody. How you have love
[55:18] without the spirit. You said because you
[55:20] were sanctified without the spirit.
[55:22] Satan's still in the heart. Get in the
[55:25] word. Satan is still in the heart and
[55:27] they claim to have love. How can you?
[55:29] When love is in seed for working through
[55:31] a bride now and vindicating it.
[55:35] Everybody knows about it. Not me. You
[55:39] prophets white says so. Some different
[55:40] ones. They all give testimony to it, but
[55:43] they curse it. So, no, we got it here.
[55:48] Well, praise the Lord. What is it? The
[55:51] Holy Ghost brunch me home. I love the I
[55:53] love God's word. Amen.
[55:57] Praise God. Feel good now. Amen. I'm
[56:00] trying to explain to you God so loved
[56:03] us. Therefore, I love God. I'm going to
[56:07] keep his commandments. Keep his sayings.
[56:10] He spoke it through a prophet's mouth.
[56:11] Hallelujah. This is not God's because
[56:13] prophet's words is his words. His
[56:16] sayings, his commandments, the shout
[56:18] message. And this is in 64 that I'm
[56:22] reading here from 162. relevant because
[56:24] 64 see being horn now the Holy Ghost
[56:28] bunch being honest
[56:31] that he had when he went away then when
[56:33] he comes it'll catch the whole thing in
[56:35] the rapture when they are justified
[56:37] sanctified in baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:40] that peril will stand again the house of
[56:42] God will live again it doesn't live now
[56:45] when the sne's coming on to it lives
[56:48] when
[56:50] when the wind comes up on it don't
[56:52] forget that Now the sign knew in the
[56:54] flesh coming on now. Amen. It's adding
[56:57] now. But he going to say prophesy when
[57:00] speak to the wind. Tell it and it'll
[57:02] blow up on it. And you'll see the things
[57:05] you're looking for. You'll see this
[57:07] Jesus living in you. You'll see living
[57:10] faith. Amen. Living fruits living. You
[57:14] seen it now day by day right here in
[57:18] your midst. Amen. Praise the Lord. Well,
[57:21] about 5 minutes more. Amen. You tired?
[57:24] No. Youary? No. Well, okay. I can
[57:27] because cut it off here. We don't
[57:29] understand about natural birth, the
[57:31] earth, the prophet. He preached it. You
[57:32] just read the book. See, spiritual
[57:34] birth. Amen. Okay. Now, because remember
[57:38] the fourth light, I will restore sayith
[57:40] the Lord in the fourth stage. Not the
[57:43] morning of the third day when life
[57:45] appears, baptism, Holy Ghost, but at the
[57:48] end when the signs come.
[57:50] See this when he walks in when they
[57:53] finally get together after all the
[57:55] rumors
[57:57] up and down the whole day. Amen. And
[57:59] they got together in the evening time
[58:01] and Thomas wasn't there either
[58:04] and they was together and they was on
[58:06] one accord in there and he walked
[58:07] through the wall. He slipped in there
[58:10] and spoke to them and then he talked to
[58:12] them and the thing that he did because
[58:14] he honed them out. The living
[58:16] resurrected word opened their
[58:19] understanding to the scriptures. Is that
[58:21] right? Showed mighty committing because
[58:24] infallible proofs to them. So because he
[58:27] dried them out, he added to them many
[58:30] things on the scriptures. Then for about
[58:33] 10 days they just dried right out.
[58:37] Then he sent down his spirits. Amen.
[58:39] They were just completely dry. But the
[58:42] thing about it, he himself told them to
[58:44] go to that place. So they was in one
[58:47] place cuz he told them to go there. They
[58:50] was on one accord cuz he told them all
[58:52] that I'll send you the Holy Ghost. I'll
[58:55] baptize you with fire. Amen. So brother,
[58:57] their hearts were still waiting for
[58:58] that. Are you waiting for brother? Amen.
[59:01] Glory to God. They was right there every
[59:02] day. There wasn't nobody peeping around
[59:05] in prayer. They all was praying out
[59:08] fervently. There was nobody. You can
[59:11] feel a spirit when you praying to God
[59:12] and somebody is listening. It happened
[59:15] to me all the time before here. A
[59:16] brother came to me. He says, "Brother,
[59:17] you were praying in your prayer about
[59:19] brother so and so." I said, "What?" He
[59:22] said, "You know what? How I know about
[59:23] him? What happened to him?" I couldn't
[59:26] believe it. This brother walked up to
[59:28] me. We had a prayer meeting now about
[59:29] six years ago. And I'm praying out for
[59:31] this brother in different ones. The
[59:33] brother asked me, "What is wrong with
[59:35] him?" I thought if he was praying,
[59:38] praise the Lord, he wouldn't be hearing
[59:39] me. Amen. So, I'm only trying to show
[59:43] you they was on one accord. They had
[59:46] love. They had a desire in there. They
[59:49] wanted that baptism of fire. And
[59:52] therefore, they ain't seen nobody. Amen.
[59:55] Praise God. Therefore, God said he'll
[59:58] get a bride into one place, Christ.
[1:00:01] Amen. And they'll be on one accord,
[1:00:03] every word. They won't break a word. No.
[1:00:06] That way, one could be in Europe, one
[1:00:08] can be in Africa on one accord by the
[1:00:11] revelation of Jesus Christ. And he don't
[1:00:14] have to pick no certain time. He can
[1:00:15] come down in and come up on those who
[1:00:17] are in one accord on the word, dotting
[1:00:19] every word. Amen. Amen. Amen. All across
[1:00:22] the world. No funny doctrine. Amen. But
[1:00:25] they in one place, Christ. Amen. On one
[1:00:28] accord with the word. Amen. That's why
[1:00:30] he sent the word back because every man
[1:00:32] was a lawyer to his own self because
[1:00:33] they can lay our see an age. I'm
[1:00:35] apostle. I'm a prophet. I'm so and so
[1:00:36] and so. Is that right? But he sent a
[1:00:39] prophet with the word to get us back on
[1:00:41] one accord. Those who are elected and
[1:00:44] they are right now being dried out.
[1:00:46] Amen. Praise the Lord. The original life
[1:00:49] is the word. See now that life that was
[1:00:53] in the because in closing in the blade
[1:00:55] talent husk comes out of it. The
[1:00:58] lettering brings it out. Then when it
[1:01:01] comes out, where's it going? Got to go
[1:01:04] somewhere. It goes into the grain. And
[1:01:07] the grain, the word is on the earth, a
[1:01:08] message, and it walks right into it. So
[1:01:11] therefore, part of the full life was in
[1:01:16] Luther Wesley Pentecostals. Part of that
[1:01:20] life was in there. And that part of
[1:01:23] eternal life, Paul prayed for you that
[1:01:25] you would get the fullness of it. But
[1:01:27] you got to walk into the word first cuz
[1:01:29] he can only move by his word and his
[1:01:31] spirit. And you got to apprehend it for
[1:01:34] yourself. When the angel came because
[1:01:36] came to Mary and told her that God loves
[1:01:39] you, Mary, you're highly faithful. Me?
[1:01:42] Yes, sir. Just like you. But she
[1:01:44] couldn't believe it. So therefore, she
[1:01:47] knew about Isaiah 9:6. Now she knew all
[1:01:49] about it.
[1:01:50] But when that spark of faith cuz it was
[1:01:53] told her you she applied that word to
[1:01:57] her life. When she surrendered her will
[1:02:00] to God and applied it to herself. Then
[1:02:03] the Holy Spirit that was right there
[1:02:05] brewed over created
[1:02:09] God in her womb right there. The same
[1:02:12] prophetic message spoken by an angel
[1:02:14] Gabriel. We had a prophetic message. the
[1:02:17] life come out of the ark up in heaven
[1:02:19] come down to told us that you're going
[1:02:20] to have the same fullness of God. Amen.
[1:02:23] So surrender to it and then the Holy
[1:02:26] Spirit is right now I can prove it
[1:02:28] rooting over you bringing forth this
[1:02:31] life as a because when I read this to
[1:02:32] you. Amen. So now in closing
[1:02:35] justification made a way for
[1:02:36] sanctification. Sanctification made a
[1:02:38] way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:40] and the baptism made a way for the Holy
[1:02:44] Ghost. Christ himself, love, charity,
[1:02:48] Rosa, Sharon, whatever you want to call
[1:02:49] him, come down and get into that word,
[1:02:53] all the word, and then bring it and
[1:02:56] manifest himself in the fourth stage,
[1:02:58] signs following it. See it now, friends.
[1:03:01] Praise the Lord.
