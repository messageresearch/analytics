[0:13] you
[0:17] [Music]
[0:30] you
[0:43] [Applause]
[0:52] I suppose we can begin good evening and
[0:56] thank you for coming welcome one and all
[0:58] to Azusa Street a gospel musical thank
[1:04] you I implore and supplicate you to sit
[1:11] back repose relax as you witness the
[1:15] recapitulation and elucidation of
[1:18] historical exploits that forever repre
[1:21] costs and transform the sacrosanct a
[1:24] religious world the ones I'm Lloyd all
[1:27] starchy in credo Dogma within the
[1:29] Christian realm were replaced by
[1:31] boisterous Pacific spirited praisings
[1:35] you follow me I wish I could see your
[1:44] faces right now at the result is
[1:49] unprecedented paroxysm of or explosion
[1:51] of the Holy Spirit you will experience a
[1:54] vivacious proliferation of jubilation
[1:56] that will unfold unfurl and emanate from
[1:58] this very stage as you rejoice and
[2:00] resonate to the captive preparations of
[2:03] spirited and intransitive
[2:06] and I will say even Cosmo tellurian
[2:09] melodies all the events in characters
[2:12] portrayed in his venerable production
[2:14] are bonafide
[2:15] authentic representations of actual
[2:18] fortuitous happenings and personages the
[2:22] dissertation she will hear were culled
[2:24] from the actual sermons and teachings of
[2:26] Reverend William J Seymour as well as
[2:29] the testimonies and affirmations of
[2:30] Azusa believers at this time I beseech
[2:33] you to quench suppress and lull or
[2:36] mobile and halt of all commutative
[2:38] devices and converse devices in order to
[2:41] ensure Universal on obstruction and non
[2:44] disjoint activity throughout the
[2:45] performance
[2:46] well I'm kidding I want to welcome you
[2:51] to the performance and
[2:54] I will just recap some of what I said
[2:57] more simpler language the last thing I
[3:00] said was to please turn off your cell
[3:02] phones all the way off because the
[3:06] communication interferes with the
[3:08] electronic microphones we have also
[3:10] please no flash photography or anything
[3:12] of that sort that would not have existed
[3:14] there as industry and I do want to
[3:18] welcome you to a zoo the street the
[3:21] musical written and directed by Ruth
[3:23] Robledo and performed by the pharmacies
[3:25] Gospel Tabernacle drama ministry
[3:31] [Applause]
[3:40] I want to take you back to the beginning
[3:44] of the previous century
[3:46] to a time where there were people across
[3:49] this country who are not satisfied with
[3:52] their religion and their churches and
[3:55] felt there was more to God they began to
[3:57] seek more of God the seed for the sister
[4:00] city of I began in Kansas spread to
[4:03] Texas and eventually exploded in Los
[4:05] Angeles and what happened transform
[4:08] religious world to this name it was the
[4:11] perfect the Pentecostal movement in the
[4:13] beginning of the restoration of
[4:14] spiritual gifts to God's church and God
[4:18] used the most unlikeliest people to
[4:21] produce this revival uneducated poor of
[4:25] many races and ethnicities they got it
[4:29] together with all color lines blurred at
[4:32] a time when identities that did not
[4:34] happen they were led by an
[4:37] african-american or a Negro as it would
[4:39] be called in those days at a time when
[4:41] white people sitting under the ministry
[4:43] of a black man would have been
[4:44] blasphemous so as these events unfold
[4:48] just keep in mind that all of the scenes
[4:51] you're about to see are based on actual
[4:52] eyewitness accounts the characters that
[4:55] will be portrayed are real characters
[4:56] the sermons that will be preached are
[4:58] real sermons and the testimonies are
[5:00] also testimonies and the actual words of
[5:02] the believers of Azusa Street and at
[5:05] this time I want to take you to the
[5:06] first scene titled the love of God this
[5:10] scene takes place many years and some
[5:11] revival and I will let but I see more

[32:47] [Music]
[32:51] hallelujah well good morning brothers
[33:01] and sisters I'm mighty happy to be with
[33:07] you this blessed Sunday morning here in
[33:12] Los Angeles California pardon me I
[33:15] forgot my hat
[33:16] god bless your sister Nia thank you
[33:27] amen
[33:28] well the Lord is good he's been blessing
[33:31] me I've been thinking of heaven I now I
[33:37] travel many places but I never been to
[33:43] the West and it's my honor to be with
[33:49] you this morning all the way from
[33:53] Houston Texas god bless you
[34:00] well Saints for my little sermon this
[34:04] morning if I had to pick a title to it I
[34:08] would call it receive ye the Holy Ghost
[34:16] and church it's so important for us to
[34:25] receive the Holy Ghost with speaking in
[34:28] tongues because without it we cannot see
[34:34] our Blessed Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[34:39] hallelujah
[34:43] so the first step and seeking the
[34:51] baptism with the Holy Ghost is to have a
[34:55] clear knowledge of the new birth and our
[34:59] souls
[35:01] which is the first work of grace and
[35:05] brings everlasting life everlasting life
[35:11] to our souls therefore being justified
[35:19] by faith we have peace with God amen
[35:26] today every one of us that repents of
[35:31] our sins and turns to the Lord Jesus
[35:34] with faith in Him receives forgiveness
[35:38] of sins justification and regeneration
[35:45] are simultaneous the party sinner
[35:51] becomes a child of God through
[35:57] justification the next step for us is to
[36:03] have a clear knowledge of the Holy Ghost
[36:06] of the second work of grace wrought in
[36:11] our hearts by the power of the blood and
[36:15] the Holy Ghost amen for by one offering
[36:25] he has perfected
[36:30] for ever them that are sanctified we're
[36:36] of the whole East Coast also is a
[36:39] witness to us that's in Hebrews 10 14
[36:45] and 15 the scripture also teaches that
[36:53] both he that sanctifies and them that
[36:59] are sanctified he's so good he that
[37:12] sanctified and they who are sanctified
[37:16] all one glory to God for which cause he
[37:29] is not ashamed to be called their
[37:32] brethren amen
[37:36] isn't the Lord gracious as Hebrews 2:11
[37:42] so we have Christ crown and enthroned in
[37:47] our hearts The Tree of Life yes we have
[37:55] the Brooks and the streams of salvation
[38:00] flow in our soul my lord but praise God
[38:08] you think that's enough the Bible says
[38:14] we can have rivers rivers of water for
[38:23] the Lord Jesus yes says he that
[38:27] believeth on me as the scripture has
[38:31] said out of his innermost being shall
[38:38] flow rivers rivers of water this fake he
[38:46] of the Spirit for the Holy Ghost was not
[38:48] yet given but praise God he is given now
[38:56] to us and it's poured out upon all flesh
[39:04] all races nations and tongue are
[39:12] receiving the baptism with the Holy
[39:14] Ghost and fire according to the prophecy
[39:19] of Joel when we have a clear knowledge
[39:27] of the justification and sanctification
[39:31] through the precious blood of Jesus
[39:33] Christ in our hearts then we can be
[39:41] recipients of the baptism with the Holy
[39:45] Ghost
[39:47] many people today are sanctified cleanse
[39:51] from all sin and perfectly I say
[39:54] perfectly consecrated but they have
[40:01] never obeyed the Lord according to acts
[40:06] 1 4 5 and he and luke 24:39 god amen
[40:24] thank you my dish thank you my friend
[40:28] as I was saying Luke 24 and 39 for their
[40:39] real Pentecost what's the real Pentecost
[40:47] the endowment of power for service and
[40:51] work and for sealing unto the day of
[40:56] redemption hallelujah the baptism with
[41:02] the Holy Ghost is a free gift with that
[41:07] repentance upon the sanctified
[41:10] transversals now he which establish it I
[41:17] said he which establishes yes us with
[41:24] you in Christ and hath anointed us is
[41:28] God who has also sealed us and given to
[41:37] us the earnest of the Spirit in our
[41:41] hearts 2nd Corinthians 1:21 and 22
[41:47] I praise God for the sealing of the Holy
[41:53] Spirit onto the day of our Redemption
[41:57] yes praise the Lord yes that is the word
[42:02] I just quoted to you everywhere from the
[42:05] Bible yes
[42:07] dearly beloved the only people that will
[42:12] meet our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[42:14] and go with him into the marriage supper
[42:17] of the lamb are the wise virgins not
[42:24] only saved and sanctified with pure and
[42:30] clean hearts but having the baptism with
[42:36] the Holy Ghost amen the other the others
[42:46] we find will not be prepared they have
[42:55] some oil they have some oil in their
[43:11] lamps but they have not a double portion
[43:16] of its spirit before Pentecost the
[43:23] disciples were filled with the unction
[43:25] of the Holy Spirit that sustained them
[43:31] until they received the Holy Ghost
[43:33] baptism
[43:35] many people may I say again many people
[43:44] today are filled with joy and gladness
[43:47] but they are far far from the ndu mana
[43:51] power sanctification brings rest and
[43:58] sweetness and quietness to our soul

[1:39:19] Oh father
[1:39:31] surrender tonight thank you brother
[1:39:56] Richard dear ones in Christ we are
[1:40:04] seeking the baptism do not seek for
[1:40:12] tongues but for the promise of the
[1:40:14] father and pray for the baptism with the
[1:40:17] Holy Ghost and God will throw in terms
[1:40:21] according to acts 2:4 Jesus taught the
[1:40:28] disciples to tarry at Jerusalem they
[1:40:32] obeyed him and waited for the promise of
[1:40:36] the father and when the day of Pentecost
[1:40:41] was fully come they were all in one
[1:40:45] Accord in one place and suddenly
[1:40:56] suddenly there came a sound from heaven
[1:40:59] yes as of a rushing mighty wind and it
[1:41:03] filled all the house
[1:41:05] what they were sitting and there
[1:41:10] appeared unto them cloven tongues like
[1:41:14] as a five and it sat upon each of them
[1:41:18] and they were all filled with the Holy
[1:41:21] Ghost and began to speak with other
[1:41:24] tongues as the Spirit gave them
[1:41:27] utterance acts 2:1 through four wind is
[1:41:37] always typical of the spirit of life
[1:41:40] that's true and it filled all the house
[1:41:44] where they were sitting and the rivers
[1:41:48] of salvation had come and had filled the
[1:41:51] whole place and they all were immersed
[1:41:56] or baptized in the Holy Spirit praise
[1:42:00] God hallelujah and they were all filled
[1:42:07] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[1:42:10] in other tongues as the Spirit gave them
[1:42:13] utterance
[1:42:15] no I love it do not be too concerned
[1:42:18] about your speaking and touch them well
[1:42:24] let the Holy Ghost give you others yes
[1:42:27] and it will come just as freely as the
[1:42:30] air we breathe amen it is nothing worked
[1:42:37] up but it comes from the heart yes with
[1:42:43] the heart man believeth unto salvation
[1:42:52] let me repeat that with the heart yes
[1:42:58] man believeth unto righteousness and
[1:43:03] with the mouth confession is made unto
[1:43:07] salvation
[1:43:10] so when the Holy Ghost life comes in the
[1:43:15] mouth opens to the power of the Spirit
[1:43:18] in the heart
[1:43:20] glory to God in seeking the baptism
[1:43:26] first get a clear and definite witness
[1:43:29] in your soul that you have the abiding
[1:43:33] Christ within then there will be no
[1:43:37] trouble in receiving the Pentecostal
[1:43:40] baptism through faith through faith in
[1:43:46] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for it
[1:43:51] is a free gift that comes without
[1:43:54] repentance yes bless His Holy Name

[2:01:29] still steal away and hide away and just
[2:01:31] try to be alone with God and I was so

[2:01:38] Carly I wouldn't comment what would it
[2:01:41] do and and how would it be praying and

[2:01:59] as they begin to walk towards me they
[2:02:03] begin to fall under the path they begin
[2:02:06] to shake
[2:02:11] and brothers and sisters and it's same
