Pennsylvania just wasn't enough time amen but I thought i' bring it back here today the Revelation Jesus Christ book 11 and uh paragraph 107 oh listen to this then if the wedding garment is the baptism of the Holy Spirit how we how are we going to be represented any other way if the first church age had to come by the door Christ Jesus be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ receive the baptism of Holy Ghost to put on the wedding garment how we coming any other way if you come by the Methodist or the Baptist Pentecostal or any other denomination you'll be bound and cast out into outer Darkness you got to come by Christ Jesus the way the door the truth and the life we have to come that way and so therefore he said that on Blasphemous names 39 and 40 he said it's a birth I've been birth into this into this into this and this right on up The Virtue knowledge and Temperance and so there a birth in there then when of a birth you're born and something comes out other words if

Headstone the prophet I want you to notice he never said that he'd bring forth the Cornerstone he shall bring forth The Headstone we got to catch the headstone and this is the only thing that will Attract it seven flashing voices and eyes and lamps and Thunders and uh that will attract that headstone to seal it up for Rapture Grace to go into the resurrection go out to meet the bridegroom and you'll be able to go prayed up with every manifestation that the Bible said will be operating in you will be in you the manifestation and we know the scripture says that Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone amen he's also the headstone now we will thank for a few moments that the seventh Church messenger was to restore the faith of the children them back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit while in judgment that's what Malachi 4 come to do what the people walk around this message all s for he come to rebuild to restore and they put the emphasis over

bring forth this headstone he had laid the foundation he had took he had taken the people back in type to the foundation which we all know that these candlesticks and so forth represented both Jewish and church they were Olive branches the Bible said there in the olive branch we had a wild branch that was graphed into the root and the tame Olive Tree Gentiles and out of these two branches come sensor pipes going into the seven golden candlesticks to give light to the seven Church ages oh oh my praise God according to the prophecy that this Prince Will Come Amen on page 10 now according to the prophecy there will come The Headstone and I want you to notice that when he headstone comes the prince that's going to cry out the message will cry Grace Grace gra Grace who's Christ again the Holy Spirit who will he be in you the Holy Spirit say Grace not judgment and then you watch the church being rebuilt right on up Grace Grace until the headstone yeah yeah for it's by Grace we saved not of works that's any man should boast and the message of Grace has been tramped under the feet of men until it's become a disgrace some of them run out into eternal security some run out into everything but the true message of Grace Remains the Same and there is where Satan tries to knocking out from under the church but it's the grace of God that we all save by oh my I'm finished praise God hallelujah my God yes sirable my my The Headstone rejected when the when the first time he was rejected again the second time but according to prophecy he will come again I I want to strike something here Zechariah 4:10 just pick up your Bible here I was up in the pocon no and I I got blesses when it passes on to you I just want to say Lord what would I say to your people when I come back and I was reading Zechariah 4 and uh I usually go down to verse S and leave it there but he said read on I got to verse 10 and for who hath despised a day of small things for they shall rejoice so who shall rejoice as War what and what are these small things and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubu now I know zerubu is a type of Christ with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth I said now what could that mean amen and the Holy Spirit said well go over the breach amen breach 101 praise God um he's speaking there about the seven horns with of seven chur churches and seven Church ages and seven as the Lamb's protection what he protected his rights on on Earth well was a God sent group of people that protected it see each age stepped out and protected the lamb rights arenius and Paul and all of them and Martin colum was protecting after the prophet left we are protecting the Lamb's rights of redemption and many don't

all the high Mighty ones praise God I did this and I'm the prophet's going to tell me this and oh my praise God Amen with the little no bodies Fe not little flock W I will reveal it to whomsoever I will to the pope no to whomsoever I will to Washington DC no to whomsoever I will to the millionaires no to whomsoever I will to the great Bishops and the TV evangelist all to whomsoever I will Lord yes sir and when this happens that voice drops back to these people praise God you rejected me praise God just keep her in Step keep her in Step California slides in a physical shutting of the door and they're gone they're running to and fro give me some oil amen you go to those that buy and sell it go back to the same ones that you uh trying to get from before amen but we got a vessel on the sign pipes praise God oh my I'm finished now sure enough see I wasn't too long was I brother Twi amen praise God yes sir amen cuz you know why because I can't go any further amen I'm I'm gone a God in Simplicity 35 now you see while it was in a simple way and everybody against him everybody was at his throat all the Ministerial Association everything else was at his throat that's true trying to get rid of him and everything else but in that Simplicity even though they had no cooperation with his campaigns and whatever more they had everybody thought he was a crank God was hiding himself but when it come time watch for that seed to get ripe that had been planted this the time for that seed huh see see when that seed to get r that been planted see God manifested himself by sending fire out of Heaven yes sir God hiding in Simplicity and then revealing himself again it pleased God to do that God hiding in Willam brandham in Simplicity and then speaking through Willam brandom the word God and then hiding that word in you and me in Simplicity but then ready to reveal when it gets rape when it gets rape sends fire out of Heaven fire baptism to burn that seed up praise God yes sir God hiding suppity and then revealing himself again it pleased God to do that he's always did in such a way now we find out that he promis these things the troubles today so many of us people we want to get so you know Seminary denominational educated minded that God can use as God can give a man to start do something give him a Ministry the first thing you know he go to catering to what others say you see so I don't do that I stay with what he tells me amen that's the Ministerial Association see what others say and the first thing you know he'll get all wrapped up in a big bunch of stuff and then God just takes his hands off him and let him alone then he'll try to find him another man somebody that will do it he's got to find something that will take his word will take the divine revelation and won't move with it but stay right there on that word that's the way he does it he's always done it that way so when a man gets so educated and smart till he tries to put his own interpretation well like they say the baptism of the Holy Ghost they'll say oh that was for another day but if they don't well it it wasn't for another day but I'll tell you it don't come just like it did on the day of Pentecost we received the Holy Ghost when we believed and all kind of stuff like that you see and talk about the baptism in jesus' name and the Bible teaches that way they say well but the Seminary say so and so that's compromising God can't use a person like that now watch he may let a man be beat all across the country like that and a Man cast out and laughed at and made fun of and everything else like that but when that real Showdown comes amen God stands up and vindicates himself right in the same Simplicity oh who do you say this is praise God my God my God so you stay with that word though it's simple and don't seem like nothing but my God the creator of this universe of the whole thing is in you in Simplicity oh you're somebody you miss Jesus Christ oh cuz the real Showdown is here I'm finished now page 11 here on message of Grace we got theologians today we got doctors of divinity we got great men all over the world that's smart intelligent educated but it takes now watch it takes a Simplicity of believing God to make his word speak out to show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever takes a humble heart dedicated to God to bring Jesus Christ into present tense amen see into present tense every day since the prophet left present tense I know what he did here thank God he sent Malachi for but he he sent him to give me this for every day I'm going thank him for every day and this ha will give me Faith for this rapturing Grace seven Thunders give faith for rapturing Grace hair I'll praise him for this I'll praise Him present tense and I'll praise him for the promises glory to God yes sir oh hallelujah praise not by power or by might only by my spirit saith God I will unfold this mystery and he'll cry to it Grace Grace with shoutings and
