miraculous healing of my knee is for the glory of God I was suffering tremendous pain had to wear a brace I was on medication and had to receive injections once a month April 24th April 21st 1994 I received a second opinion concerning the the prognosis of my left knee the news was not good Dr Dominic nappy informed me that the knee had suffered much wear and tear there was shredding of the of the bone because uh bone was now on bone due to the the deteriorating of the packing in between the bones uh that packing was now gone and the pain from the rubbing and shredding going on the doctor told me I needed to have an operation for a total knee replacement the surgery was scheduled for May 25th 1994 all brothers and sisters something began to happen and I decided to cancel the surgery her faith because I felt in my heart and believe that God was going to heal me I spoke to Sister Coleman on April 19th and let her know how severe my condition had become then on Friday night April 22nd the day after I canceled the scheduled surgery brother Coleman called me and fell to uh to pray for me over the phone now listen when I was I called brother Jose kenon is in the bank and asked he's a friend of hers what is her condition he told me that the bone was shredding I said now listen now that's a spoken word brother amen that's I know what that is because the prophet called me one night for sister Lawson Jawbone and he spoke the word and gave her created a new jaw bone amen I was on the phone with her praise God so I'm not afraid of that promise because I know it's for the bride amen may be seated that was on Satan's Eden I think August 29th and that's where he said she will turn at the west and she'll ride back yes she sure will that's a promise you know amen so I thought Lord and he told me well you prayed for Leon a wimple back in 1984 and she didn't have a disc and she was healed and they had the x-rays so then I said well I'll go ahead and pray to him and as he prayed I began to feel a burning sensation go from my knee down to my ankle disc contined for a couple of hours after he prayed and then it suddenly left and I immediately felt a great relief the pain and numbness were gone however when I woke up the next morning a tremendous pain suddenly began in my knee I told Satan that I was healed took wait a minute watch took off my brace and stopped taking the medication the pain then left Faith amen may be seated the pain then left and since that day April 23rd has not returned I decided to go to the doctor to find out just exactly what happened so on June 7th I was sent for a new set of X-rays then on June 20th Dr P MO reviewed the x-rays just here last week he pointed to the X-ray and said you see this is where the bone was deteriorating and shredding but now it is completely healed God can do [Applause] anything don't limit God tonight [Applause] Miracles are happening Brother wesco's Church man dying and everything

and we know it and all kind of things is happening the world falling apart sort brother BR said just got through with those Seven Seals just recently I like to go through them again on paragraph 12 and just how the Lord bless us and many of you have has heard and read in the Life magazine and things the things that taken place during that time when they caught a picture even of the seven angels as was predicted and as we went West he told me 3 months before where it would would be and how and I'd be standing there and there it was and the cameras and oh for hundreds of miles caught the picture of it right there just exactly where for was for told EX exactly and if I ever preach anything that was inspired in my life it's the Seven Seals and I know we're at the end time 1963 now watch and the last name that goes on that book now watch the Holy Spirit here or the last name that's redeemed how are you redeemed water Blood Fire that's how you redeem that's how redeems the Earth and

all these things going on here in June 9th they had this tremendous earthquake that went from I believe it was uh Bolivia Amen on June 9th and went up to Alaska and the trim felt to Toronto and you can't find in the newspapers nothing they don't want to shake the world up because they went 400 miles down into the Earth and then there was a discrepancy in brother Frank kite he heard up in C he heard about it three or four months all the prophecies going forth that something would happen on June 9th and there's been many prophecies one fell in California I think the name is uh brother Hinkle or something like that a year and a half ago he had a vision that on June 9th that God would rip the the evil out of the earth he had this vision and he kept telling everybody Pat Robinson the 700 Club and all the different religious uh programs and so forth amen then on June 9th this earthquake they couldn't they didn't know whether it was June 8th or June 9th and brother Frank said he he heard it up there in Canada or someone told him that it just a few minutes past 12:00 at night went off this great earthquake brother what a sign my God she's ready to shake down but the Holy Ghost wants to bring down the Holy Ghost himself on the earth praise God Amen yes okay okay you do you have that now maybe seated now watch you got the hour and you see uh uh president uh Clinton making America completely Sodom and New York about over 50,000 of they had the streets tied up and everything else and brother Jonathan explained to you last night we are here so make up your mind don't leave here in the same state it's finished it's over [Applause] finish amen all right glory to God now watch now we in a strange time when we leave here now I'm not setting no season Amen brother brm set the season it's laying in the quotes and the Holy Spirit got it revealed to you like he did Simeon Simeon stand up you're going to see the Christ that's how I preach that's how I preach seasons amen all right it might be a strange time did you ever think people will go right on preaching the church will go right on even thinking and getting people saved it's too late then it's all over see come in here you young people now amen I'm not trying to shake you in here you predestinated to be in here amen it's too late then it's all over and the message will go to the totally lost just like it did in the days of Noah seven days in the ark you can read it for yourself souls in prison brother Bram said three or four places there that the ark sat there to give a testimony and Noah and the family was in the ark and the Ark sat for 7 days before it rained on May 7 then the same water that drowned the world say water picked the ark up and that same L rain praise God will take us out of here praise God and judge the world Amen may be seated who was the ark the ark was Christ Christ sat on that Earth and as the ark en tied and they were in the ark and God is going to manifest seven Living Voices it won't be you it'll be to the total loss and going to sent there brother brandham said the church must remain a while and preached a total loss oh brother when that Divine love come when that anointing strikes home the door is shut okay may be seated people go right on preaching church will go right on even thing to getting people saved too late then it's all over and the message will go to the total loss like it did in the days of Noah seven days in the ark it did in the days of Sodom Jesus himself his third stage of his ministry and you don't hear nobody talking about it but he yet he said it on souls in prison he said his third pull like Jesus had to go and preach to souls in prison and the opening of the word the Seven Seals the Mysteries revealed that's his third pull and if you Brethren will check out your index from voice of God you'll see from uh the unveiling of God he must have preached my 50 messages outside of brandom Tabernacle who is he preaching to and in Bram Tabernacle he was revealing the Mysteries and where are we at now what are we waiting for huh you may be seated it's a strange time that earthquake went off March 27th oh my brother Ram identified he said Jesus Christ officially turned down I wonder if he's turned down again that voice of the voice well let me put it in a word The Voice will be in that bride and once more the world will hear the voice of God from the bride seven Church Ages page 340 amen he went and pre precious Souls that were Eternal loss that were in prison repenting not and longsuffering in the days of Noah and we don't know what time these things might be there's many people in prison right now they're Bound in themselves bound to lust bound to this and bound to jealousy bound to Pride and they are not going to move until they see the Divine love on the earth Christ himself speaking House of Hell give way to the name of the Lord and brother them bars are going to be breaking and creaking and people will come out of there screaming shouting here come your children running out of there here come your families come running out of there praise God God can do anything amen all right may be seated we don't know what time these things might happen now let's be warned just don't stand around let's do something about it if we're not right with god let's get right with God Amen page three disciples

understand I'm tring trying to say now not the Pharisees the disciples they said why did the scribes say that Elias must first come he wasn't talking to the Pharisees because he knew who they were and he knew that if they had a chance they would have received him but he was there when two-thirds of them was kicked out of heaven and they come down and took came into ministers and deacons and whatever and false unnown ones and like the Pharisees in his day when they come to him with all the precious and unbelief so he knew who they were cuz they was up in heaven when they were kicked out

released by The Lamb we approach that place tonight this the first seal God help us as the seals are broken and release the mysteries of the book are are revealed now you see this is a sealed book we believe that do we not we believe this is a sealed book now we never know this before but it is it is sealed with Seven Seals that is is on the back of the book the book is sealed with Seven Seals and they can't understand that what you see inside in Revelation 6 those are symbols that was written to the church the Seven Seals inside was for the church to know that there are seven seals on the backside but that was Malachi Force message [Applause] amen okay may be seen it we believe a seal book amen the book is sealed with Seven Seals amen if we were talking about this kind of a book it would be like putting a strap across it and there would be seven straps like this and it with a seal first 2 third fourth fifth sixth seven straps around the book and then You' pull it and would go all the way down through the book and come back around on the backside huh the Revelation with okay sh amen all right if we were talking about this kind of a book it'd be like putting a strap across it seven straps but it isn't this kind of a book it's a scroll and then the scroll is Unwound that's one then laying right into the scroll is number two and then in here but it's a mystery but yet we have probed in it but remember the book is seal and the book is a book of mystery of Revelation it is the revelation of Jesus Christ seal on the backside and six Angels open up six of them seals amen inside the Bible he sent them to open it and the seventh one under there was seven Thunders he said it cannot be outside the Bible so Revelation 81 he took it the seven Thunders the only thing left stuck to the Bible after March 1963 with seven Thunders he took that on March 24th and slipped it into Revelation 81 now is in the Bible do you understand it see I'm preaching to these young people here you got to know what your prom is I want to see you praise God Devils I have the king sword praise get out of my [Applause] way sh okay and we got it now seven straps around the Bible hope you may be seated amen relish Jesus Christ a book of Revelation now you know down through the age man has probed and Tred to get into that we all have and so we all have for 29 years and now page 138 St John 12:27 now is my Soul trouble what shall I say father save me from this hour but now but for this cause came I into this hour um father glorify thy name then came a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified and will glorified again page 139 then when the lamb took the book and broke that first seal God spoke from his eternal th Throne to say what that seal was to be revealed but when it was placed get it when it was put now John was caught up come up hi Revelation 4 now John is up in heaven Revelation 4 and he sees the throne and the four creatures and all the Angels standing around he got the whole scene but yet he looks down to 1963 and sees a the mighty angel on the air and sees a prophet on the air and the the mighty Angel roared seven Thunders amen now watch you may be seated God spoke that Throne to say that what the seal was to be revealed but when it was placed before John it was in a symbol when John saw it it was still a mystery why it wasn't even revealed right then it cannot be revealed until what he said here at the end time but it come in a symbol when it thundered remember a loud clapping noise of a thunder is the voice of God and there'll be seven voices of Thunder that will reveal the seven [Applause] Thunders amen they thought it was a thunder but it was God he understood it Jesus did for it was revealed to him it was revealed to Jesus he was the word and it's revealed to you because you are the word so they don't know what it is they just hear a lot of noise seven Thunder seven Thunder seven Thunder but to you you know what it is your [Applause] name sure amen maybe SE was a thunder notice the first seal open the first SE when it opened in a symbol form it thundered now get that don't you see why brother BR was so excited and serves this the time he said oh God have we gone this far when it opened in symbol form in the Bible it thundered and what was that Roar out in Arizona when them that blast comeing them seven angels come from eternity it thundered for the seven last [Applause] Thunders and they're still wondering maybe maybe seated amen it thundered he says now what about it when it open in its reality form hear what he's saying the reality in 1963 February 28th reality and all those years almost 2,000 years it was in symbol form and man proved at it proved at it they all the teachers they couldn't get it cuz it was given to a Kentucky prophet [Applause] Hallelujah may be seated and open his reality form it thundered amen as soon as the lamb struck back the seal and what did it reveal not all of itself versus with God number one God's got it number two next is an assemble written by John write what you see and John wrote out a white horse Rider went forth a red horse rider went forth Black Horse and Pale Horse He right SS on the Altar and a whole n nature erupted six seal got to that seventh one silence so John wrote what he saw and all the rest of Revelation symbols takes a prophet to reveal it amen first it with God next is a symbol then then it's revealed three things she's coming from the throne first it can't be seen heard or nothing it's sealed up and he got that book in his hand only a lamb can take that book and tear those seals off and send it down to the prophet my it's already happen already people waiting [Applause] for amen okay so I want you to think I'm saying this here see is coming from the throne first it can't be seen heard of nothing sealed up the lamb blood paid the price it thundered when he spoke it out and when he did a white horse rider started out it and it still was a symbol so when you read Revelation you're reading the symbol but thank God we can read it we have understanding when we hear the tapes and so forth now watch he said it would be known the last day but when it comes forth in church symbol do you understand Church it comes forth in a symbol of a church as they know there is a seal if you don't put it in there as a symbol you we wouldn't know anything about any Thunders or SEALS or nothing but he had to put in there only as a symbol so we would know that there's something there somewhere there's a God somewhere to take me out of leosa leosa this is not God God blind wretched miserable poor naked this ain't God there's got to be an angel come forth It's got to reveal these symbols and things amen or may be seated come forth in a symbol as a church they know is a seal but just what it is they don't know because it's a white horse rider and it's only to be revealed at the last day when this actual seal is broken broken to who not to uh not to Christ but to the church oh my that just makes me tremble I hope that church I hope the church truly understands see what I mean I'm going to call you bride you understand the voice is a thunder seven Thunders open the whole thing thundering out okay come from the father's Throne I can skip here I think you get the understanding now by the symbol okay I'm going to skip down for here the four horse riders each one of them the Beast Matthew Mark Luke he explains all that there trying to hurry and one of the Beast said come see he heard the noise of a thunder one of the Beast said come see in other words here stands the lamb and John is standing out there watching happen and the lamb come up from the throne like he had been slain blood all over him he was the one that was found worthy when he reached over and took the book then everything began to shout screaming and carrying on when they see him took the book you see because they knew Redemption was paid for people in the message don't even know that I don't know what's wrong with him okay now he comes to claim his own so he takes the book stands out there before John he pulls it back breaks the seal pulls the seal down when he pulls the seal down a thunder clap through the place a thunder and when a thunder CLA No Doubt John might have jumped up in the air what's wrong with jumping praise God hallelujah when it thunders brother you jump when you had a natural thunder lightning thundering praise God Amen when a thunder roar may be seated in one of the four beasts said now come and see what it is what is revealed beneath there oh my John right what you see so John goes to look and see what it was John goes to see what the Thunder said it is then that this creature told John come and see what the mystery is under the first seal the Thunder the voice of the creator has uttered it now he ought to know what what's there but now but think when he wrote this and when he started to write those uh other seven right those other seven Thunders said don't write it so he only wrote the six and he put it in simple form and it put the seventh one in Revelation 81 nothing silence and and now John don't write what you what you heard what was spoken that's in the scriptures I got a prophet he's going to do that so don't tell them cuz the whole thing will be all messed up down Through the Ages don't say what them Thunders are amen don't write that that that's a quote on Mighty exploits of faith I have it somewhere here amen don't write it he's been now he's been commissioned to write everything he seen But when these seven th Revelation 10 other don't rate they are Mysteries we don't know what they are but my opinion they will be be real right away and when they do it they'll give faith for that Rapture and Grace for that church yes sir we just move through everything that we know of through all the dispensation we watch for everything we have seen the mysteries of God we've seen appearing of the great Gathering Together the bride in the last days but yet there's something in that we just can't Enlighten ourselves with there's something or other but I imagine when these them message begin to come forth God said hold it back now wait a minute I will reveal it in that day don't write it at all John because they'll stagger over it just let it go but I will reveal it in that day when they have reason to see if there ever was a [Music] time this filthy sodomite World Lord God even so come Lord Lord Jesus open them Thunders to me Lord I might know what it is when you have reason to see when the Bride Comes to her knees all the fighting and arguing over the interpretation for 29 years and now they're all tired dead can't praise God no anointing no nothing now they have reason to see [Applause] but how they going to see if you don't preach what if you don't say what seven sunds or should you hide in the basement or should you go up on the rooftop cuz they have it's the hour to see and tell them what it is preach it Glory amen okay all righty praise God you may be seated page 142 do we have that now it's a symbol you got that I want to keep okay page 142 now the lamb is showing John in in the symbol of a church scripture like for the church to know what to write show him don't tell this just what it is don't go there down there John and say now this is what what this is and now what is under this seventh seal don't uh go down there and tell that for for if I tell that then all down through the age the whole plan will be broken it's a secret you got the Thunders what's the new name Alexander God will reward you for your Works do you read the Bible that's what Paul said thou winded walls praise God Amen don't tell what under the seventh seal don't go down and tell that if I tell for if I tell John that then all down through the age the whole plan would be broken it's a secret he coming nobody to know when he's coming I'm just coming see that's all ain't for my business to know when I will just be ready be ready when it comes and don't be caught with your your work undone Hallelujah so John went forth I thought I want to see what it is now he went forth now what he's got to do he's got to write to the church age that's what he is supposed to write to the church ages write what you see of these seven golden candlesticks in the beginning right to the church and tell them all right in the Thunder John knew it was a voice of God and come and see now he never seen exactly what it was he never understood it what he saw was God sent to the church Church watch for a time uh he will he always does he makes it plain when it's time to make it plain but he didn't make it plain why because he's going to keep it a secret until the last days and the sounding of that last Angel's message will gather up the Mysteries and make it clear but what John saw was a white horse go out with a rider on it so that's what he he wrote down that's what he said come and see and John went to see what he could see the right to the church and when he did he saw a white horse and him that said on had a bowl and went forth conquering to conquer and there was given to him a crown and now that's all that John saw that's all that he wrote down even Paul pick it up the mystery of iniquity doth already work and he didn't know what it was either but Malachi for did amen oh my John saw it where he said come and see he wrote it down see now that's in symbol that is the way the church has received it but with the promise at the last day he would reveal it

head in his face the Sun and feet as pillars of fire now we saw the same thing which was Christ and we know Christ is always the messenger of the church he's called a pillar of fire the angel of the Covenant and so forth he had in his hand a little book open now the seals have done been broke here where Revelation 10 [Applause] broke why won't they preach that [Applause] amen what you may be

voice when a lion roar and when he cried seven Thunders other their voices when the seven thund their voices I was about to write and Heard a Voice from Heaven saying un to me seal up those things which the seven Thunders Ed right them not don't write them and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea lift up his hands to heaven and swore by him to live forever and ever who created the heavens and things are in the Earth and things that are and the Sea and things which are therein it should be Tim no longer that's where Jonathan cut off last night and I'm picking it up here tonight amen page 147 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel that last Angel Earthly Angel my God this Angel come down from heaven it wasn't him he come from heaven but he's speaking here the voice of the seventh angel which an angel means a messenger anybody knows that and a messenger to the church age Amen in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery

end of time of all things End of Time the things written in the seven seal book sealed up at the Plan of Redemption before the foundation of the world it every bit ends it's the end it's the end of the struggling world it's the end of struggling nature it's the end of everything in there the end of the trumpets the end of the vows the the end of the Earth it's even the End of Time Time Runs Out Hallelujah glory to God we are here and you already in eternity the Lord himself has ascended with a Shel and you are part of that coming now the shout of God is in [Applause] you we're in it [Applause] now Hallelujah may be seated amen amen oh my the end it's the end of trumpets fils everything Matthew uh time run out Bible said I mean Revelation 10th chapter 7th verse time runs out the angel said time will be no more and the days is the great thing to happen everything runs out in this time the end of the the end of the seventh seal notice is the end of the church age it's the end of the seventh seal it's the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vows and even ends the US end of the Millennium that's on the seventh seal yes sir page 557 No Angel singing no Praises no altar service no nothing King lamb is on the earth the word he has subjects that he come to get they should be praising [Applause] him they should be for 29 years down here praising him Hallelujah you can't get hard even make him praise Him amen oh my listen may be seated No Angel singing no Praises no altar service no nothing there was silence hush deadly silence of Heaven for half an hour all the host of Heaven were silent for this half an hour when this seven sealed mystery in the book of redemption was broke open think of it but it's broke [Applause] BR amen amen you may be seated think of it it's broke the lamb breaks you know what they were AED by it I believe they didn't know there was they just stopped why what is it page 576 hey we find the six seal has been open to us we see it we know that this seven seal cannot be broke to the public until that hour Ares now you got a whole bunch of men that will pick up this quote say it's not broke he just said it was broke it's line upon line precept upon precept here a little and there a little it's veiled to them praise God and revealed to [Applause] the it's a revelation that's why you got to preach preach it amongst these Spirits amen you may be seated now there was some reason why God let the this seven voices be be thundered because it must come we finally Christ the lamb took the book in his hand he opened that seven seal it broke and he opened it's broke and it's open it's broke and it's open he opened that 7even said but you see it's a hidden mystery no one knows it now watch right along with what he said no one would know it's coming they also would not know about this seventh Thunder mystery watch see it's connected together the seven Thunders under the seventh seal are connected to the coming of the Lord and the only ones that can know it is when they see their name written in the book and the Seven Thunders hold the mystery Hallelujah brother we going out here with a shout but before we go Christ will be revealed in you the hope of [Applause] Glory Hallelujah may be seated amen see it's connected together that much we have an understanding of it because he said it open in a three-fold mystry and bang bang bang bang bang bang seven times and went into unknown tongues but it opened if it did not open he could not say seven thund was under there cuz they were still on the back side of the Bible but he took it from the backside by Revelation and put it inside amen I'm going to say something it also has a symbol the tent Vision remember the little Pentecostal baby with the eyelets here it is slides right [Applause] in so the symol couldn't even be written by John it had to be revealed to the prophet 1955 amen glory all right yes so God stretched his tent from Heaven down to the Earth in Malachi 4 oh oh what's so strange Moses had a tent Ministry read the Bible and all Israel stood in their tents and Moses went into his tent and only one person went into Moses tent and that was Joshua hallelujah oh read the word of God praise God hear the message of God all right baby seat is connected together all right hallelujah hallelujah glory to God that much we have an understanding of today because the rest of it all unfolded but this is not unfolded but sitting in my room not heard it rather but seen and unfold to the seven Thunders now that's as far as we can go right there and I trust that each and every one of you will serve God and do what is right and love him all your life and serve him and God will take care of the rest don't fight for 29 years and argue over this scripture and that quot and this quote don't do that love one another brotherly kindness forgive don't fall out with a brother because he don't see what you see amen but stay with the word if they begin to lie you well the Bible says from such turn away second Timothy 3 now we have the the completion here now by the grace of God this is Page 576 all the mysteries of the six seals has been sealed up and we understand and know here that the seventh seal is not to be known to the public because there was there those two Mysteries it was the Thunders and it was the coming of the Lord so it couldn't be known amen and he get away the secret if he held it back all those years why should he give it away in 663 okay question answer on the seals page 466 we got the church ages I'll skip wrong here preing fathers and so forth the correct interpretation bring down to this age and this lay out of SE and you don't have the history of that this is making history now did you catch what he said the bride age came on when he opened these seals the call out age the reformers age the modest age and this is the third age called out the shortest age and he called us out come to the king you are his subjects Praise Him worship Him shout because he called you out of this ungodly World he's going to give you the Morning Star let me get home here now come on you morning stars shine oh I wish I wasn't tired Hallelujah may be seated question okay here we are now we come back or with the seal open that seal God opens that seal for us what's that first there's a messenger Church age next to the Seven Seals we find the corruption that hits in the seventh Church age but the seventh seal doesn't reveal anything what's going to happen to it see watch because at the end of that church age in the l i seea Revelation 3:1 14-22 amen is to come a prophetic gift to reveal these things did you get it now the prophet was to come to reveal these Thunders and things and you had to hear his was his message revealing Mysteries do you know what I'm saying now I mean the B other way Paul already wrote in 1 Corinthians 7 by marriage and divorce and brother Brandon went up to the mountain and a pillar of fire falling up and down there and he told him to preach on marriage and divorce 1 Corinthians 7:1 12-15 is your Authority where' it come from outside the word inside the word what Paul said but a revelation and authority to tell you you are free I don't care how many husbands or wives you had but don't do it [Applause] again there's your thunder where did the California earthquake come from Thunder and all these other things that's Thunders Bo people don't understand the message you may be seated oh my a prophetic gift to reveal these things exploits of faith I know uh 1953 Chicago I know I want you to remember there's something fixing to happen remember I told you that there's a step up coming to the church now amen see these these things that you see you're now seeing are going to be just little things after a while something's are moving and I say this by the power of the Revelation Jesus Christ everyone in our Doctrine and our baptism we come to a place where there's some key that will unlock something there here now he saw the book sealed on Seven Seals and when Daniel saw the same and when the Thunders uttered now watch their voices he said don't WR listen what that was in the scripture don't write John which you what I'm telling you in here don't rate it Malachi 4 will reveal it every word of it praise God maybe SE don't write don't write what that was in the scripture but it would be revealed in the last days we at that time hey brother Mar prophesying about his own Ministry in 1953 in his second pull he knew he did you hear what he said all those seals meant something but you don't know what that seven seal meant to me he prophesied of his own message then that Mighty Angel come praise God with them Thunders that's his message tie up all the Loose Ends but introduce Messiah amen okay you may be seated proing this word paragraph 271 do you believe we live in the last days when the son of man was to be manifested that would be all the word that's gathered through Luther where Baptist and all that and the Pentecostal all now watch all gathered up to the revelation of what is all been is that what we listening to a revelation to what has all been now watch the seventh angel was to open the six seal mystery and he did March 18th through 23rd then the seventh angel come on March 24th and it B and opened it up and showed it broke it and said the Thunders banging under the there it's the coming of the Lord sh don't say no more so therefore they don't understand you open six seals I am the seven seal the seventh angel was to open six seals then after it's open amen and then is is all to be gathered up in the son of man St Luke 17:30 Malachi for the Prophet Elijah and then the seventh seal Thunders under there was to come out and that was the revelation of the son of man revealing the mysteries in the prophet through the prophet amen all right may be seated his fullness of time to come the fullness of his word to manifest the fullness of his body now watch that's the word then now watch is this the spoken word here all right that's the spoken that's the spoken word amen made manifest by the word St Luke 17:30 took his spoken word himself Revelation 10 and revealed the [Applause] word amen that's the word then that's a spoken word made manifest by the word reveal the word so what are they talking about I don't know whoo praise God [Applause] Amen all right oh my oh well where am I at I'm I'm I'm going to have to bypass a lot of this here I don't want to get to the right spot here okay now we know about the there was two Mysteries we spoke right along with what he said no one would know his about his coming they would also would not know about the mystery the seventh Thunder mystery is that correct amen so something I don't want to miss it here and uh here I am I got it here now all right hold back until the Sixth Seal now question answers oh I got that okay is to come a prophetic gift to reveal these things proing his word okay we have pick up my notes I just went ahead okay now third P was open to them Seven Seals to restore back of faith and the seventh angel Mighty Angel come
