[8:42] attention to the scriptures Saint John
[8:46] 14 and 15 and revelation 10 I want to
[8:54] kind of drop back to the 1974 and 75
[9:00] kind of pick it up in well in 1965
[9:03] actually Amen so I don't know what I'm
[9:06] gonna say and I want to say it I know
[9:09] what I would like to say but I don't
[9:11] know what's gonna come out that way
[9:12] amen so st. John 14 toil verily verily I
[9:18] say unto you he that believeth on me the
[9:23] works that I do shall he do and greater
[9:26] works than these shall he do because I
[9:28] go into my father and twentieth verse a
[9:32] man in it at that day you shall know
[9:36] that I'm in my father and you and me ye
[9:39] and me and I in you and sin st. John
[9:43] 15:7 you abide in me and my words abide
[9:46] in you you shall ask what you will and
[9:49] it shall be done unto you amen in
[9:54] Revelation 10 and I saw another mighty
[9:58] angel come down from heaven clothed with
[10:00] a cloud and a rainbow was upon his hand
[10:03] and his face was was as it were the Sun
[10:07] and his feet as pillars of fire and he
[10:10] had in his hand a little book open and
[10:12] he said his right foot upon the sea and
[10:15] his left foot on on the earth and cry
[10:18] with a loud voice that's when a lion
[10:20] roaring and when he had cried seven
[10:23] thunders uttered their voices and when
[10:25] the seven thunders had other their
[10:27] voices I was about to write and I heard
[10:30] a voice from heaven saying unto me seal
[10:33] up those things which the seven
[10:36] other and write them not mercy and the
[10:39] voice which I heard from heaven speaking
[10:41] to me again and said go and take the
[10:44] little book which is open in the hand of
[10:46] the angel which standeth upon the sea
[10:48] and upon the earth and I went into the
[10:50] ain t and said unto him give me the
[10:53] little book you said unto me take it and
[10:55] eat it up and it shall make thy belly
[10:58] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[11:00] sweetest honey and I took the little
[11:03] book out of the Angels hand and ate it
[11:05] up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[11:07] and as soon as I had eaten in my belly
[11:10] was bitter and he said unto me then thou
[11:15] must prophesy again before many peoples
[11:21] and nations and tongues and kings
[11:24] so now made a lot of a blessing read
[11:27] numbers word and we see here in
[11:29] Revelation 10 8 through 11 it was a
[11:32] prophecy that was to go forth after the
[11:35] Prophet left
[11:42] amen I promise II had to go forth after
[11:47] 1966 you may be seated
[11:50] and that prophecy was a testimony of
[11:53] Jesus which is a spirit of prophecy so

[48:36] earnestly continue for the faith may be
[48:39] seated
[48:40] that was once delivered to the Saints
[48:42] and now the very faith that they had at
[48:46] the beginning it supposed to be today
[48:50] yet
[48:51] a man and in order to preach the gospel
[48:56] before you can make it a gospel to be
[49:00] preached then you got to have the power
[49:03] and demonstration of the Holy Spirit to
[49:06] prove the gospel the letter killeth the
[49:09] word to let it kill it the spirit make
[49:11] it a line so it's not just a ritualistic
[49:13] affair but it's absolutely a real living
[49:17] reality of the resurrection of Jesus
[49:20] Christ living among men hallelujah and
[49:25] the and that's the faith that I'm trying
[49:29] my best to contend for today that Jesus
[49:31] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[49:34] forever and his power is unlimited don't
[49:40] limit God by your reasoning
[49:43] or God wouldn't do that for me don't
[49:45] limit God with your imagination all
[49:49] things are possible
[49:51] God said soul hallelujah the hardest
[49:56] thing that you think that God cannot do
[49:58] those are the things he would love to do
[50:03] yes so that very things that you think
[50:07] he cannot do that's what he wants to do
[50:11] don't limit God that is seated and
[50:16] that's the faith that's the faith that I
[50:20] have been contending for since December
[50:22] 6 26 1965 myself me Amen shout of the
[50:29] king praise god I've been contended for
[50:31] ever since I don't care who come in here
[50:33] who left who did this don't matter to me
[50:35] as child of the king is in the camp and
[50:38] I've been here all these years
[50:39] and I was standing in my luck I'll
[50:42] prophesy in a clear day the testimony of
[50:46] Jesus is the spirit of prophecy no demon
[50:50] no devil no nothing can take me out of

[51:21] introduced the faith huh John the
[51:24] Baptist introduced it he introduced
[51:27] Jesus to the world and Jesus and
[51:29] introduced the faint a man sitting right
[51:34] here
[51:35] now when the faith was first introduced
[51:39] to the world the faith that we we are to
[51:42] earnestly contend for John the Baptist
[51:44] introduced it he introduced Jesus to the
[51:47] world and Jesus introduced the faith now
[51:51] let's go back and see what faith he
[51:54] introduced to the world and he went on
[51:56] speak about the faith and that's when he
[51:59] said it's not me but the father do it
[52:01] the works you got it now that's why I
[52:04] read st. John 14:12 he that believeth on
[52:07] me the works that I do shall he do also
[52:08] the fame and that that day you shall
[52:13] know the father to me and I am the

[52:57] that right
[52:59] the Spirit of Christ in the Apostles we
[53:02] have often called the book the Acts of
[53:05] the Apostles that was wrong
[53:07] it's the Acts of Christ in the Apostles

[1:03:39] doing what is that attraction up there
[1:03:41] on the hill is God making history and
[1:03:44] God fulfilling prophecy wasn't it
[1:03:47] prophesied in the Old Testament the
[1:03:49] prophets that Christ would come he would
[1:03:51] die and everything else prophecy it was
[1:03:55] fulfilled
[1:03:57] [Applause]
[1:03:59] God fulfilling prophecy and then always
[1:04:02] causing an attraction that's why I have
[1:04:06] all these 27 years has been a traction
[1:04:10] they don't know what's going on who is

[1:04:39] morning's message and the Eagles also
[1:04:42] they come together to find out what's
[1:04:45] going on some coming in to the thunders
[1:04:48] for curiosity some come coming to find
[1:04:52] fault others coming to criticize

[1:06:06] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[1:06:08] prepare the way of the Lord there's two
[1:06:11] prophecies for me and another thing did
[1:06:13] you not recognize our prophet 400 years
[1:06:15] ago Malachi when he spoke on the 3rd
[1:06:18] chapter and said behold I send my
[1:06:19] messenger before my face to prepare the
[1:06:22] way don't you know this fulfills
[1:06:24] prophecy prophecy was being fulfilled

[1:11:58] looking for doing pretty good here now
[1:12:02] there's two things connected with the
[1:12:04] prophecy to understand one redeeming
[1:12:09] time in the time of the revelation of
[1:12:12] these things being made known let's sing
[1:12:18] okay number two claiming time by fire in
[1:12:23] the time appointed by God the time of
[1:12:30] the revelation of these things being
[1:12:32] made known is in the time of the
[1:12:34] ministry of the word you got there now
[1:12:39] the word and in there from 1966 was a
[1:12:43] revelation to make known these things
[1:12:53] the claiming time is in the time of the
[1:12:56] ministry of the spirit and that's why
[1:12:59] I'm doing I'm doing because the Spirit
[1:13:01] is this raised up but you got to know
[1:13:04] this that's why he brought you together
[1:13:10] anything that happened hallelujah oh my
[1:13:15] long as you are devout and sanctifying
[1:13:18] anything happen
[1:13:21] okay let's prove these points I don't
[1:13:25] want to linger here doing good pretty
[1:13:26] good here amen
[1:13:29] the breach 1963 page 89 so you see Jesus
[1:13:35] was God he was not no third person
[1:13:37] fourth person second person he was the
[1:13:39] person he was God he was God Emmanuel
[1:13:42] God came down from his glory revealed
[1:13:45] himself grace produced the person of
[1:13:48] Jesus Christ and we find this book God
[1:13:51] stretched his tent came from God to
[1:13:56] become a man he changed his stream from
[1:13:59] the Almighty to be a man to take on the
[1:14:02] form of man so he could die to redeem
[1:14:05] man oh wait till we see him when there's
[1:14:09] a when there's nobody worthy there it is
[1:14:12] there's a redeemer Christ has redeemed
[1:14:15] us now we are now in redeemed but he has
[1:14:19] not claimed this possession yet you
[1:14:21] might differ with that but just hold on
[1:14:23] a minute we'll see he hasn't claimed it
[1:14:26] see if he took the book of Redemption
[1:14:30] everything Adam had everything and he
[1:14:32] lost Christ redeems bang now he's
[1:14:37] already redeemed us
[1:14:39] but he hasn't took the possession yet
[1:14:43] are you understanding this though he
[1:14:46] cannot until the time appointed and then
[1:14:50] will come the resurrection and then the
[1:14:52] earth will be renewed again and then you
[1:14:54] take possession his possession which he
[1:14:56] got when he redeemed us but he would do
[1:14:59] it at the appointed time all mine this
[1:15:02] is described in this seventh seal book
[1:15:04] are we talking of now all right the book
[1:15:06] of redemption is all described in there
[1:15:08] all what Christ would do at the end will
[1:15:11] be revealed to us this week in the seven
[1:15:14] seals if God will let us see all right

[1:15:19] and we got Clementine is that correct we
[1:15:24] have that now all right and he's art now
[1:15:27] you already redeemed he's redeemed but
[1:15:29] he hasn't claimed and he cannot claim
[1:15:31] until the time appointed of God other
[1:15:35] words God has a time for the spirit to
[1:15:38] pour out because he had to send his word
[1:15:42] to go out and call him from left and
[1:15:45] right praise God

[1:31:06] the word is the believer the word is
[1:31:12] that believed in every age if there was
[1:31:15] no word seeing you would be nothing but
[1:31:18] that word was placed in you before the
[1:31:20] foundation of the world and that is a
[1:31:22] believer that's how you could come here
[1:31:24] and believe different measures of faith

[1:31:45] redemption may be seated he he he was a
[1:31:47] word and he is the word that's bound to
[1:31:49] be him you see so this is the whole book
[1:31:53] of redemption which is Jesus Christ
[1:31:55] fittingly put together by God with the
[1:31:59] promises of Redemption and healing and
[1:32:01] everything for the human being do you
[1:32:05] get that now this book is Jesus Christ
[1:32:11] put together by God and he come as a
[1:32:15] human being and redeemed us and every
[1:32:17] promise is in him and for you for he is
[1:32:21] the Redeemer oh who do you say this is

[1:32:56] the last name is redeemed the book is
[1:32:58] closed I'm trying to get you to
[1:33:01] understand that before that fire
[1:33:02] claiming turn my and when the last name
[1:33:07] is redeemed the book is closed and he
[1:33:10] didn't intend that no one be lost but
[1:33:13] his foreknowledge let him know who would
[1:33:15] be lost therefore he could predestinate
[1:33:17] and then their names were put on the
[1:33:18] book and then when that book of
[1:33:20] redemption is closed and sealed with
[1:33:23] seven seals why was being raked out like
[1:33:27] I told you being worked out by the
[1:33:29] mysterious powers of God and some day
[1:33:32] when the book of redemption is finished
[1:33:34] the lamb takes it and then the last name
[1:33:37] is called off of that the lamb comes
[1:33:39] down to call for what he has redeemed by
[1:33:44] a fire baptism yes sir

[1:34:16] there the Bible no listen to this very
[1:34:19] carefully the Holy Spirit's about blew
[1:34:23] my mind out back in April we find that
[1:34:26] he saw there was no one upon the earth
[1:34:30] that was worthy to take the book the
[1:34:33] book of Redemption and there was nobody
[1:34:35] in heaven worried that nobody it was
[1:34:37] beneath the earth nowhere was able or
[1:34:39] worthy to take the book to loose the
[1:34:41] seals or even look at it and he went
[1:34:44] because in this book was the book of
[1:34:47] redemption
[1:34:54] oh I wonder if you got it
[1:34:58] [Applause]
[1:35:01] in the book was the book of redemption
[1:35:04] you know the one that Adam had that
[1:35:09] could bring sons and daughters he fell
[1:35:14] in sin and God took it back their names

[1:35:31] Luke the names that would have been
[1:35:34] spoken by Adam was in that pump title

[1:35:46] John had the Holy Ghost a person that
[1:35:49] Apostle everything else and I was on how
[1:35:52] the pettiness but he could have come
[1:35:54] back to the iron because of the title
[1:35:56] deed was in them seven seals that's why
[1:36:02] he was shouting and screaming and when
[1:36:05] that lamb broke them seals down to our
[1:36:07] prophet and you don't know what it's all
[1:36:12] about praise God you don't know what
[1:36:14] brother Reuben was shouting about over
[1:36:16] him and he went because the in this book
[1:36:20] was a book of redemption his own name
[1:36:22] was in there and nobody was worthy and
[1:36:25] he was already had the Holy Ghost he was
[1:36:28] Apostle it did signs and wonders and
[1:36:30] miracles just correct but his name was
[1:36:34] in that book of redemption

[1:37:06] then the Bible is the book of redemption
[1:37:08] Jesus Christ and he wept because in this
[1:37:11] book was the book of redemption his own
[1:37:12] name was in there and nobody was worthy
[1:37:15] to even look upon the book let alone a
[1:37:18] pull his name out of there sinking I'm
[1:37:24] finished you know just about here did
[1:37:28] you now come back for you did you catch
[1:37:30] that Church in this book in the book was
[1:37:33] the book of redemption huh testimony to
[1:37:38] help you Monday April 23rd after April
[1:37:42] 22nd when the Lord told me I had to go
[1:37:44] in the pulpit now all the pain and
[1:37:46] misery everything else but what a
[1:37:48] blessing that Sunday the 22nd you know
[1:37:52] so the next day I was reading this very
[1:37:54] quote Monday I was as I was just this is
[1:37:59] my testimony as I was reading this quote
[1:38:01] in an identification to Larry speaking
[1:38:04] about John and he went because in this
[1:38:07] book was the book of redemption this his
[1:38:10] own name was in there and nobody was
[1:38:14] worthy
[1:38:17] the Holy Spirit revealed the following
[1:38:19] revelation to me revelation 10 8 through
[1:38:24] 11 the book of redemption with the names
[1:38:27] in the book in the blood section of the
[1:38:29] book of life was transferred from
[1:38:32] revelation 10 8 through 11 to ephesians
[1:38:35] 4 11 through 13 to the five for mercy
[1:38:39] the week of September 10 through the
[1:38:41] 17th last year okay so on the 22nd was
[1:38:51] give us see now but the Fergus is not
[1:38:54] here
[1:38:54] brother Fergus inspiration he asked the
[1:38:57] angel for the he got it on that
[1:38:59] Wednesday for the book the angel
[1:39:02] continued up into the pulpit maybe he
[1:39:04] went to in the pulpit was one angel to
[1:39:06] dress in black and this one had a white
[1:39:09] that's the mark an angel that's marking
[1:39:12] here I mean that's this is the one with
[1:39:14] a death just one here for life and
[1:39:16] that's been going on in New York City
[1:39:17] all these years
[1:39:18] I hope you understand what I'm saying it
[1:39:22] just goes right on because they missed
[1:39:24] their day of visitation
[1:39:28] and God never says nothing they just go
[1:39:30] right on they walk out and they're gone
[1:39:32] whether they missed it their visitation
[1:39:34] you see it was very plain so that third
[1:39:38] agent was the one in revelation 10 yeah
[1:39:40] the wings here at the book and brother
[1:39:43] Ferguson ran after him and asked for the
[1:39:45] book he wouldn't give it to him he came
[1:39:48] up in the pulpit correct and come up
[1:39:51] behind me and stepped into my 16
[1:39:55] elements is that correct and my Bible
[1:40:00] was sitting there and the angel took the
[1:40:04] book of redemption and he put it in
[1:40:07] there
[1:40:08] [Applause]
[1:40:14] right
[1:40:15] that was well the Ferguson's experience
[1:40:18] amen
[1:40:19] okay may be seated I'm almost finished
[1:40:21] here I'm trying to get right here okay
[1:40:24] he asked angel for the book the ancient
[1:40:26] continuing up into the pulpit we stepped
[1:40:28] into me and passed place the book that
[1:40:31] was in his hand right into my Bible it
[1:40:34] was laying on the pulp on the top of the
[1:40:36] pulpit then I understood that the book
[1:40:39] of redemption in the Angels hand was the
[1:40:42] names in the prize in the book of
[1:40:45] Redemption April 22nd the book of
[1:40:50] redemption of the bride's names was
[1:40:52] placed in my Bible and now when I preach
[1:40:55] the word the name is in the word and the
[1:40:59] five fullness it will call out a bride
[1:41:01] by the word revealed by Malachi 4 and
[1:41:04] now placed in the spoken word along with
[1:41:08] the names from the book of redemption
[1:41:10] revelation 10 and 1 through 4 8 through
[1:41:13] 11
[1:41:17] this will be back to the word again st.
[1:41:22] John 1320 the fivefold ministry will
[1:41:25] interpret the word to the brine on the
[1:41:27] earth

[1:41:30] understand and as the spoken word being
[1:41:33] the original seed which places the seed
[1:41:36] germ in the fire for ministers body
[1:41:39] Philip a Peter you understand okay
[1:41:43] which-which loose which places the seat
[1:41:46] germ as I as it wasn't Peter and Paul
[1:41:49] and Philip in the Apostles in Malachi a
[1:41:51] for what a revelation today is what a
[1:41:54] rule here indeed something supernatural
