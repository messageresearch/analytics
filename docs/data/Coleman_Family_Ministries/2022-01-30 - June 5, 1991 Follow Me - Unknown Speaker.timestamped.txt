[0:43] saint john 5 43
[0:46] ye have heard that it hath been said
[0:49] thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[0:51] thine enemy
[0:53] but i say unto you love your enemies
[0:56] bless them that curse you do good to
[0:58] them that hate you
[1:00] and pray for them which despitefully use
[1:02] you and persecute you
[1:05] that you may be the children of your
[1:06] father which is in heaven
[1:09] for he maketh his son arise on the evil
[1:12] and on the good
[1:13] and send it rain on the just and on the
[1:15] unjust
[1:17] for if we love them which love you
[1:21] uh what reward have ye
[1:23] if ye love them that which love you
[1:26] do not even republicans the same and if
[1:29] you salute your brethren only
[1:31] what do ye more than others

[1:55] when thou was young he's still dealing
[1:57] with peter here thou art girders thyself

[2:04] forth thy hands and then another shall
[2:06] gird thee and carry thee with thou what
[2:09] is not
[2:10] this fake he signifying by what death he
[2:13] should glorify god and when he has
[2:15] spoken this he saith unto him follow me
[2:20] in ephesians 4 11 and he gave some
[2:22] apostles some prophets some evangelists
[2:24] and some pastors and teachers
[2:27] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[2:28] work of the ministry for the edifying
[2:30] the body of christ till we all come in
[2:32] the unity of the faith and of the
[2:34] knowledge of the son of god and to a
[2:36] perfect man unto the measure of the
[2:38] statue of the fullness of christ may god
[2:40] in the blessing of the word just by his
[2:42] word to pray heavenly father we have
[2:44] read the word of god and now lord may
[2:47] the whole great holy spirit drop down
[2:49] now father to bless the word of god back
[2:51] to the people's hearts and ears father
[2:54] we committed into thy hands in jesus
[2:56] name for a few moments amen and amen and
[2:59] amen praise god
[3:01] [Applause]
[3:02] amen now we're in the word now
[3:06] amen you may be seated now
[3:09] brother norman have a little title
[3:11] follow me
[3:13] and my subject is godliness that's
[3:17] my perfection is be therefore perfect
[3:20] my original inspiration and purpose
[3:23] of calling these meetings and it still
[3:25] is be therefore perfect
[3:29] marriage and divorce
[3:30] page 14 brother bram said usually a
[3:33] revival only lasts about three years
[3:37] but this has been going for it for over
[3:39] 15 years
[3:41] and not one denomination has sprung up
[3:43] from it for this is seed time
[3:47] do you finally understand seedtime
[3:50] everything that prophet spoke is a seed
[3:52] a word
[3:53] huh
[3:55] there's no more shock after the shark is
[3:57] gone is seed
[3:59] god is ready if he isn't doing it now
[4:03] he's going to call a church to
[4:05] perfection
[4:07] listen by his word jesus christ
[4:11] that's why i preach the word jesus
[4:13] christ
[4:15] because that's the only way you will
[4:16] come to perfection
[4:18] amen if you want to come to perfection
[4:21] church do you see how perfection comes
[4:24] number one is by the revealed word
[4:27] for we could read the bible we don't
[4:29] have a prophet to tell us what is
[4:30] revealed
[4:32] for this age what are the popular sins
[4:36] that and then if he tells you all about
[4:38] the rock and roll and all these
[4:40] wild things why would you go back to it
[4:43] doesn't even make sense
[4:45] amen it's not a point of your father
[4:47] mother not being with it or don't
[4:49] understand what the prophet said
[4:52] it's a popular sin
[4:54] it's of the devil
[4:55] praise god run for your life
[4:57] [Applause]
[4:59] you play with your soul
[5:02] amen
[5:03] praise god
[5:07] it's the reveal word that's why you read
[5:09] the prophet's message and then they tell
[5:11] you all about television and all these
[5:13] things in hollywood and all these
[5:15] singers and they're singing for the
[5:16] devil
[5:17] starting with elvis presley and all the
[5:20] rest
[5:21] are singing for the devil
[5:23] why would you look at somebody singing
[5:25] for the devil
[5:27] doesn't even make sense
[5:28] you have a fellowship with satan
[5:30] praise god
[5:32] so do you see that you can't become
[5:34] perfected by that
[5:36] amen
[5:38] see and you get in your car and you turn
[5:39] on and here comes a
[5:41] summary of some record on that's been
[5:43] there at that station there
[5:45] so then you get i get in your car i know
[5:46] what you listen to amen
[5:48] [Music]
[5:49] praise god seeing is by the revealed
[5:52] word back to the bible again to manifest
[5:55] the pride again
[5:57] see the pride in him will be manifested
[6:00] by the bible
[6:02] it won't be because they have books and
[6:04] tapes
[6:04] but because the bible will be living out
[6:06] of them
[6:08] amen
[6:10] they be walking holy holy holy unto the
[6:12] lord
[6:13] hallelujah they will take the world and
[6:17] the things of the world and the wreckage
[6:19] and the music and the rest of the film
[6:22] praise god
[6:25] don't you understand if you have one
[6:26] rock and roll record praise god he's got
[6:29] one drum beat on there that's from
[6:31] africa
[6:32] that's voodoo
[6:33] that's from the devil
[6:35] it is the drum that the devil uses
[6:37] [Applause]
[6:38] [Music]
[6:40] so there all of it is no good
[6:42] because they all use drums
[6:45] can't young people understand that amen
[6:48] praise god you may be seated
[6:51] back to the bible again to manifest the
[6:54] pride again in perfection
[6:57] and my inspiration i told you before
[6:59] i'll say it again i'm trying to bring
[7:01] you to the reality of the presence of
[7:04] christ
[7:05] that you might see him
[7:07] through resurrection faith
[7:09] and know that it is him
[7:11] by his identified promise of this day
[7:14] for this day
[7:15] be there for perfect

[7:29] the beginning
[7:30] and it was a visitation to thomas uh to
[7:33] make him know that christ had indeed
[7:35] been resurrected
[7:37] amen and making him declare in so much
[7:40] my lord and my god

[7:45] that was written in this book the
[7:46] scripture says
[7:47] 1974 when i preached the same message i
[7:51] had about six miracles to report
[7:54] and this time i preached i said well i
[7:56] don't have any miracles lord but i'll
[7:57] preach it anyway
[7:58] and he said go and preach it to know him

[8:33] was prayed for may 12
[8:35] and may may 26 you shall
[8:39] be healed

[9:11] on may 14 she was having much pain after
[9:14] she was here for
[9:16] no doubt some of you the same condition
[9:18] but she was ignoring the
[9:20] pain fighting it a man just like you
[9:25] and she had to go to the doctor
[9:27] and she said when she got there they
[9:29] said we have the hospital in your bed
[9:31] ready for your
[9:33] operation
[9:35] and before she got there she had been
[9:37] praying that she would get the video
[9:39] again
[9:39] she phoned brother baloma but she
[9:41] couldn't get through with something i
[9:42] wanted to ask for the video
[9:44] but the horizon laid on my heart to send
[9:46] those videos out so she had to go on may
[9:48] 14th at nine o'clock that morning the
[9:51] post came and there was the video
[9:54] [Applause]
[9:55] amen
[9:57] so she just want to hear those words
[9:58] prayed over her again
[10:00] to give her a faint
[10:03] amen
[10:04] to walk into the doctor
[10:07] so she heard it the tape arrived and
[10:09] then it got to the doctor there and the
[10:11] nurse said now we uh

[10:37] she said it made her sick so she just
[10:38] stopped taking them and she just trusted

[14:26] likeness
[14:27] uh number two in the dictionary says way
[14:31] hence one going in the same way
[14:34] follow me his way
[14:36] means expressed in the union
[14:39] in saint john 21 18 very very i say unto
[14:42] thee when i was young without good as
[14:44] myself took your own self and walker's
[14:47] wither thou was you did what you wanted
[14:49] to do
[14:50] whenever you wanted to go
[14:52] you went to you went fishing you put on
[14:54] any kind of music you want to put on no
[14:57] doubt praise god yes sir who won't tell
[15:00] you anything different
[15:02] hallelujah parents can't tell you
[15:04] praise god amen you slide around the
[15:06] ministry
[15:08] yes siree praise god
[15:11] amen you think god don't know what
[15:13] you're doing
[15:14] amen
[15:16] amen
[15:17] you do what you want to do and when you
[15:19] witness but when thou shalt be old
[15:21] listen to the holy spirit prophesying to
[15:23] peter who doesn't even have the holy
[15:25] ghost who failed them many times but yet
[15:27] he's going to use them
[15:29] amen praise god
[15:31] why because he's predestinated
[15:33] so don't you sit there and cast away
[15:35] your confidence praise god because you
[15:37] failed god misery so many times
[15:40] hallelujah cast not away there for your
[15:42] confidence god is able right now
[15:45] to seal you and fill you
[15:47] praise god
[15:49] hallelujah
[15:52] glory may be seated so you went where
[15:54] you wanted to do did what you wanted to
[15:56] do but he's prophesying now but when
[15:58] thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch
[16:01] forth thy hands and another shall gird
[16:03] thee and carry thee with her with our
[16:05] waters this speak he signifying by what
[16:08] death he should glorify god and when he
[16:11] has spoken this he says unto him follow
[16:13] me
[16:14] prophesied to him told that you want to
[16:16] die for me upside down praise god and
[16:19] you want anything to do with it now i
[16:21] tell you peter follow me
[16:22] [Applause]
[16:24] when you follow me i open your
[16:26] understand through the scriptures i'll
[16:27] pour out the holy spirit on the 50th day
[16:30] and seal your way praise god
[16:33] and you'll live a life for me peter how
[16:36] many pears do we have in here
[16:38] praise god amen
[16:41] may be seated
[16:42] so we see now a prediction of the kind
[16:44] of death he would glorify god with was
[16:47] pronounced upon him and death another
[16:49] would take him to where he would not
[16:51] desire to go to death and the grave
[16:54] amen
[16:56] praise god
[16:57] and godliness now is the sixth virtue
[16:59] follow me
[17:00] the acceptance of this commission was to
[17:03] prove costly
[17:05] you got to give up something now praise
[17:07] god
[17:08] this led to a physical movement but much
[17:11] more is implied
[17:13] peter was being summoned to on deviating
[17:17] faithful walk
[17:19] undeviating praise god
[17:22] hallelujah
[17:24] to set his face as flint
[17:27] even as jesus had done in view of the
[17:29] approaching cross
[17:31] and follow use of a servant soldier or
[17:34] pupil following their leader even to
[17:38] death
[17:39] this statement no doubt a relieved peter
[17:43] showing that christ was not going to
[17:45] make any more predictions of his
[17:47] weakness and failure
[17:49] because he had failed god so many times
[17:51] and he was feeling that the lord was
[17:53] kind of you know hitting them kind of
[17:54] hard there but when he told me he won't
[17:56] die for me
[17:58] oh praise god man then peter was happy
[18:01] then to know that the lord had to prove
[18:03] to him throughout the lord loved him you
[18:05] know the lord all the time never looked
[18:08] down on him one time
[18:10] never thought lowly of him
[18:12] it was peter thinking lowly of his own
[18:14] self right now tonight god don't think
[18:16] lowly of you praise god god has you way
[18:19] up here but you have yourself way down
[18:22] there
[18:23] so praise god get rid of yourself forget
[18:26] about what you say take what he says of
[18:28] you not what you feel about yourself
[18:31] amen
[18:33] praise god
[18:35] hallelujah
[18:38] you may be seated two things he was
[18:41] commanded to do amen peter was asked to
[18:43] identify himself with the word
[18:46] he was uh being asked to be like god to
[18:49] be like christ
[18:51] follow me what a calling
[18:53] in life
[18:55] and talk
[18:56] and walk
[18:57] even in death
[19:00] so where does amy grant come in here
[19:03] with all these rock and roll singers
[19:04] coming in what time do you have for them
[19:06] praise god
[19:08] when you are supposed to be home out in
[19:10] westbury out here and there following
[19:12] christ
[19:13] gathering together praise god around the
[19:15] tapes singing with joy the christian
[19:18] songs there is a fountain filled with
[19:22] love that ain't old-fashioned praise god
[19:25] it'll bring down the power of god and
[19:26] baptize somebody in there but amy
[19:29] grandchild won't bring out it'll bring
[19:31] the devil in there praise god
[19:33] the mariah will bring the black mariah
[19:35] right up there for somebody dead praise
[19:37] god yes sir
[19:40] hallelujah
[19:42] glory to god amen follow him
[19:45] in life and talk and walk in death
[19:48] be
[19:51] amen identified
[19:51] may be seated saint mark 8 34 whosoever
[19:54] will come after me and let him deny
[19:56] himself
[19:58] and take up his cross and follow me
[20:00] that's that sixth virtue colonies amen
[20:03] number one is where you become like
[20:05] christ
[20:06] number two be therefore perfect
[20:08] identifications in three phases with
[20:11] christ's cross now the first thing
[20:14] the christian comes to the cross
[20:17] and there he sees himself a sinner
[20:20] mary sees with a vision in christ on the
[20:23] cross and the blood streaming down for
[20:25] him and what christ did for him that he
[20:28] identifies
[20:29] christ identified with him
[20:32] by calling him and telling them what he
[20:34] did for
[20:35] then he identifies back and say i'm
[20:37] selling out to the world i want to be
[20:40] like jesus hallelujah
[20:42] glory
[20:44] glory to god
[20:46] amen
[20:47] that's what christianity is all about to
