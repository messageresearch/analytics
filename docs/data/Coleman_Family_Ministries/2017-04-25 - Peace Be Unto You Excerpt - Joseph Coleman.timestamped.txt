[0:00] I'd like to take a pH out of here peace
[0:02] be unto
[0:04] you now we see here from acts 1 the3rd
[0:08] verse that Jesus Christ had
[0:12] a resurrection Ministry of 40 days he
[0:16] was seen aloud for 40
[0:19] days and by many infallible proof signs
[0:23] and
[0:24] wonders and also he was speaking things
[0:28] pertaining to the kingdom of God
[0:30] in other words you have to open the
[0:33] understanding to the scriptures first in
[0:36] this post ministry here that he was
[0:39] getting prepared to receive the baptism
[0:42] of the Holy
[0:45] Ghost the physical temple of God was
[0:51] resurrected back in the
[0:54] midst say something the mechanics the
[0:58] body
[1:00] was resurrected back in the
[1:04] temple what a day we living in I wonder
[1:07] this morning with the spiritual
[1:12] manifestation of the mechanics of his
[1:18] body which is a
[1:20] [Music]
[1:21] pyramid faith is the foundation and

[1:26] wonder this morning is that mechanic
[1:30] Body Temple
[1:32] Tabernacle are spiritually manifested in
[1:36] here this morning amen I
[1:39] wonder if it is he will show himself a
[1:46] liar he will speak things pertaining to

[1:50] God wouldn't it be wonderful if we can
[1:53] from this day enter into a little
[1:56] Ministry like this
[1:58] here for about 30 40 days maybe it would
[2:02] just cap off everything I have preached
[2:05] from the
[2:06] poit oh I say Lord if I could just enter
[2:09] into a Vindication of the things that
[2:11] have been
[2:14] preached now my purpose for the next
[2:17] month or so I'm trying to bring to you
[2:21] the reality of the presence of
