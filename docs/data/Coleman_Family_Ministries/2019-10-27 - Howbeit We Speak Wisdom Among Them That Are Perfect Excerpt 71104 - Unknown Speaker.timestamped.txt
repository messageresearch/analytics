[0:00] what can we say about the pen Harris

[0:19] yes sir you may be seated pinheiros
[0:22] convention
[0:23] what about them buttwater victory amen
[0:29] [Applause]
[0:32] so to my understanding this convention
[0:36] witnessed the following thing as you
[0:39] know my inspiration from me 1974 has
[0:43] been three phases that were hidden in
[0:46] brother and God's God's second coming
[0:52] second coming of the Lord and the street
[0:54] phase of hitting a on page 13 the Lord
[0:57] spoke and told me that these three
[0:58] phases are HID and my second coming and
[1:01] these three phases will hook into
[1:03] Malachi for third pole so he said when
[1:08] you reached so the first one was
[1:09] brotherly love and that was capped
[1:12] orange in 1974 and that started from
[1:15] 1966 and capped off in 1974 nine years
[1:19] and then wholly of decency came in 1975
[1:22] in Fort Wayne and then that was capped
[1:25] off in 1983 with the outpouring of the
[1:29] baptism of the holy ghost in New York
[1:30] and across the world
[1:31] amen so now the number three is what
[1:35] took transpired and took place in pin
[1:38] Harris nest place in Christ adoption
[1:43] time

[1:53] years but now we're here

[2:03] it's a time for me to connect it to the
[2:05] third pull and opening of the word the

[6:07] no matter where I went
[6:09] you may be seated I went to Europe South
[6:11] Africa South America why did I go there
[6:14] for what did I go there for to contend
[6:17] for the faith that's what I was doing
[6:18] all these years i was contending for the
[6:20] faith that was once delivered to malachi
[6:24] for why did I go there to contend for
[6:26] the faith that's what I went for
[6:28] well praise God seven thunders gives
[6:30] faith for ranching grace that's what he
[6:33] showed me amen
[6:34] god bless you
[6:39] so what's going on here today as we
[6:42] reach our third phase we automatically
[6:44] connect with the third pool brother :
[6:48] what is the third pole the opening of
[6:49] the word the mysteries revealed what
[6:53] mysteries the hidden mysteries
[6:55] revelation 10-7 the mystery of God
[6:58] should be finished do you know we ant
[7:01] today new york PA in july 2004
[7:05] first corinthians 2 verse 6 Christ as
[7:08] the mystery of God revealed on page 45
[7:12] he reads the scripture there and he
[7:15] comes on down about Paul saying here I
[7:19] think is the fourth or fifth verse my
[7:22] speech and my decision was not with
[7:24] enticing words of man's wisdom but in
[7:26] the demonstrate of the spirit power see
[7:30] there's there's see there's the gospel
[7:32] jesus said go into all the world and
[7:34] preach the gospel didn't say go teach
[7:36] you say go preach in other words
[7:39] demonstrate the power and these signs
[7:41] shall follow them just teach them don't
[7:43] do it it takes the actual Spirit Elohim
[7:47] who will be here on a third phase to
[7:50] demonstrate the power
[7:54] that your faith should not stand in the
[7:57] wisdom of men but in the power of God
[7:59] she changed a man now what not what I
[8:02] can explain away and say he's not the
[8:04] same he is the same if I do that surely
[8:08] it shows me that surely a man tell me
[8:10] that would be showing me that he don't
[8:12] have the revelation the three full
[8:15] revelation of God so then then he hits
[8:18] the first corinthians verse first
[8:22] corinthians 2 verse 6 and howbeit and
[8:24] weakness among you that are perfect and
[8:28] yet we are not with the wisdom of the
[8:31] world but of the princes of this world
[8:32] that come to know it we speak the wisdom
[8:35] of god in mystery and brother Branham
[8:37] says see the threefold
[8:40] mystery of God even the hidden wisdom
[8:43] which God ordained before the world to
[8:45] our glory which none of the princes of
[8:47] this world knew none of the priests
[8:49] rabbis and so anybody knew anything
[8:52] about it for if they had known it it
[8:54] would have not have crucified the Lord
[8:55] of glory so now we see elohim's back
[9:00] part of his mind I think brother David
[9:02] Thompson said that in the back part of
[9:05] your mind is I think is in three
[9:07] sections back there
[9:10] you get it threefold mystery
[9:13] [Applause]
[9:20] and a 3/4 mystery was sealed by seven
[9:24] thunders
[9:26] and also brother branham on Super Saiyan
[9:29] Southgate 1962 he tied to three full
[9:33] mystery the mystery of God religion ten
[9:36] seven and the seventh under mysteries he
[9:38] tied it all together and he revealed
[9:41] every mystery soul so now we understand
[9:48] now that we have to be mature we have to
[9:53] be full-grown
[9:54] we have to be perfect and then if we are
[9:57] then the threefold mystery will be
[10:00] revealed to us
[10:02] it's it's a three full revelation of the
[10:05] hidden wisdom in a mystery and Christ is
[10:10] that mystery a threefold mystery of God
[10:14] even a hidden wisdom of God it can only
[10:16] come to mature Christians golden brown
[10:21] seeds let me give you a little testimony
[10:24] here 1973 I told before I went down my
[10:29] first time with the family down to
[10:30] Pennsylvania and to find my roots then
[10:34] down in Pennsylvania and went down to
[10:38] Mount Pocono in different places there
[10:41] and enjoyed the pennsylvania countryside
[10:44] and there my friend have sent me a
[10:49] letter we were very used to talk back
[10:50] and forth and some things going on in
[10:53] the tabernacle and he would just write
[10:55] me a letter just see if I had anything
[10:57] to say about it the Lord told me and
[11:00] don't answer that he says then he gave
[11:03] me the scripture this scripture first
[11:05] Corinthians 2 verse 6 how big we speak
[11:09] wisdom among them that are perfect
[11:10] mature so did you catch what I said
[11:13] don't bother with anybody in the message
[11:17] until we come to his day I don't there
[11:23] is
[11:26] [Applause]
[11:27] you understand what I've been doing now
[11:30] and he also gave me maybe seated
[11:34] Jehoshaphat and a ham when Ahab tried to
[11:38] trick Jehoshaphat had he asked
[11:41] Jehoshaphat for his bride rule and he
[11:44] put it on impersonating but the king of
[11:48] Syria they knew he was anyway and they
[11:51] killed him and then the Lord gave me the
[11:52] scripture he said when my people get
[11:55] away from human leaders I will come to
[11:59] him today
[12:00] who is he Elohim will come
[12:04] [Applause]
[12:09] and we see that the human leaders of
[12:12] just about played out totally drying
[12:15] dead shook
[12:17] amen no one knowing they know nothing so
[12:22] it's time for Ella him to come to his
[12:23] people
[12:28] yes sir
[12:31] so now now the street full mystery of
[12:36] God even the hidden wisdom all these
[12:38] hidden mysteries can only come to mature
[12:42] Christians golden brown seeds full grown
[12:45] corns of wheat in the July hot Sun which
[12:50] we in now which is charity which is the
[12:54] dynamics which is Elohim returning in
[12:56] power in the time of life which is sun

[13:44] full-grown no more children ready to
[13:46] become young men to these people we do
[13:50] impart a higher wisdom previously hidden
[13:53] in three full mysteries sealed by seven
[13:57] thunders in the back part of God's mind
[14:00] amen before the foundation of the world
[14:02] on September 20th 1974 God began to
[14:06] reveal this hidden whistie wisdom with
[14:10] the revelation of the seven thunders

[14:44] and other books
[14:45] Daniel series I begin to study these
[14:48] books in September 1981 I was looking to
[14:52] understand about what is the revelation
[14:55] of the dynamics how do I get it down in
[14:58] New York and then I also want to know
[15:01] how do I preach the Lamb's Book of Life
[15:06] what is the revelation how can I preach
[15:09] it
[15:10] so after he told me to study the books I
[15:14] just read to you I just mentioned then

[15:21] with some of you but I'm gonna let you
[15:23] know because this 17 takes to go out

[15:47] in a way that has never been done listen
[15:52] to any man after my prophet brother

[15:59] my word on the spot with such power that
[16:03] Satan's Kingdom shall literally shake

[16:39] Revelation series seven seals
[16:42] Hebrews seal D I was studying all of
[16:45] that amen
[16:47] so then September 20th 1981 he told me
[16:50] the seven Thunder mysteries comes to the
[16:52] bride as the revealed word a seed that
[16:56] will bring forth the miracle September
[17:00] 28 1981 when the Holy Spirit came to me
[17:03] five o'clock in the morning before I
[17:04] preached in the beginning was the word
[17:06] he revealed to me the revelation of Ella
[17:09] him now here it is the revelation of the
[17:12] seven spirits of Elohim being the
[17:14] attributes of God as a thought great
[17:19] supernatural God is the revelation of
[17:22] the dynamics to the mechanics and then
[17:25] he told me at the Lamb's Book of Life is
[17:27] in two parts Ella Hamed as an attribute
[17:31] thought in Ella hem and then is
[17:34] expressed in the logos as a word seed in
[17:39] the logos day after day and then number
[17:42] three it becomes a manifested word the
[17:46] bride in the seven churches in your
[17:48] generation in your season and that's
[17:51] what's going on now
[17:58] on your message to know him from the
[18:01] beginning on page 8 I was speaking here
[18:06] by setting the church in order and
[18:07] that's what's being done today and
[18:09] setting the order and then God said it
[18:11] all in order then September 20th I
[18:14] believe it was August 30th or rather and
[18:16] blessing I will bless thee September
[18:19] 20th
[18:19] seven years to the day from 74 74 the
[18:23] thunders 81 seven years to the day
[18:26] Elohim seven thunders seven spirits but
[18:30] still there's something laying there a
[18:32] revelation then how can we be perfect
[18:36] well them seven spirits is Elohim and
[18:40] you catch the revelation here now so L
[18:42] ahem had to reveal to you that he is the
[18:46] seven spirits now you know how to get
[18:51] back to him so you're only going back to
[18:54] where you were in the beginning way back
[18:57] before there was a beginning and now you
[19:00] know how to get back there on the third
[19:04] phase
[19:06] for the seven thunders were other their
[19:08] voices to you
[19:10] so therefore may be seated
[19:14] catch this so therefore what are you
[19:16] going to do are you gonna sit around
[19:17] again next week do I have to come back
[19:21] in here next week again like this no I
[19:23] won't be here um and I have to come back
[19:26] then here again and guts and you got
[19:29] seven more spirits or you gonna finally
[19:32] make up your mind to die what are you
[19:38] gonna do that's what this weekend is all
[19:40] about and you have to make up your mind
[19:44] it's on you well praise God
[19:48] can we say Amen
[19:52] so starting today we will begin to
[19:55] impart may be seated
[19:57] a higher wisdom to God's elect bride to
[20:02] the perfect the mature or right seat of
[20:05] God with all of the food value in it the
[20:08] seven thunders of page 304 fourth seal
[20:11] will give faith to lift us up into the
[20:15] glory that we had in Elohim and logos oh
[20:18] yes sir I have 17 L am serious
[20:22] tapes to share with my friends and to
[20:26] know him I just read that from the
[20:28] beginning okay the third phase third
[20:30] pole now because the revelation of the
[20:33] dynamics is the seven spirits of
[20:37] Ellingham when I seen that connect with
[20:40] two attributes which forms then I
[20:43] realized that seven spirits seven
[20:46] rainbows came down to the earth
[20:48] condescending and then that was
[20:51] perfection then the only way back is
[20:54] with that perfection seven rainbows
[20:57] seven spirits so that is the revelation
[21:01] of LEM the dynamics
[21:05] are you following me so therefore on the
[21:10] third phase the reflection this is my
[21:16] thought I'm gonna speak on it the
[21:17] reflection of the seven spirits of
[21:20] Elohim as seven living voices in the
[21:24] Omega bride so these seven spirits are
[21:28] gonna reflect back here and seven living
[21:31] voices amen and a form the word image in
[21:37] you to bring you to a perfect man
[21:41] Ephesians 4:13 don't forget now it's got
[21:45] to cap off Joseph's perfection the
[21:48] revelation of it November 10 1964 so
[21:52] that's got to be capped off with Joseph
[21:54] rainbow coat which will be a perfect man
[22:04] so the opening of the word the third
[22:06] pull the mysteries revealed the fivefold
[22:09] ministry will preach the hidden mystery
[22:11] of the revelation 10 7 there's hidden
[22:13] mysteries that have to be preached
[22:14] friends
[22:15] well church do you understand where you
[22:19] are today you say Amen well you
[22:24] understand that you in July in the
[22:28] harvest month and then it and you heard
[22:32] you understood that
[22:33] therefore July is the hot Sun which is
[22:36] charity which is dynamics which is
[22:39] sunlit which is Elohim coming forth in a
[22:42] time of life you understand that
[22:47] in other words you're here are you ready
[22:50] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[22:53] you're ready for science one is
[22:55] Americans while we're here and it will
[22:59] be a short quick message and we will
[23:02] remain in July literally all the way to
[23:06] the literal resurrection now you may be
[23:14] seated
[23:15] 1981 was assigned to you of the
[23:18] ellingham inspiration season
[23:21] so therefore 1981 was assigned to us now
[23:26] how could it I should I put it we are
[23:31] going to be possible for somebody to
[23:33] start preaching all of these messages 30
[23:36] 40 50 messages in 1981 we just thought
[23:40] now trying to preach that you take it to
[23:43] next year in the following year so God
[23:46] dropped down and stored away some corn
[23:49] [Music]
[23:50] [Applause]
[23:55] with the LM anointing the faith and
[24:00] circumstances situations had to be here
[24:02] and Satan's the spirits had to be here
[24:05] to attack it and also reveal about who
[24:09] Satan is and so forth you may be seated
[24:11] so as 1981 was a sign therefore it
[24:15] relates back to 2004 because L ahem
[24:19] himself I didn't know how to approach
[24:21] the third pole all through last year are
[24:25] mainly stick leaning in surgery lady in
[24:28] the hospital and my only one thought
[24:30] laying in the hospital was how do I get
[24:32] on that third phase that third pole
[24:34] that's all so I said I'll become
[24:37] approached this way the opening and the
[24:39] finishing of the Seventh Seal I was
[24:41] going through that the whole year and
[24:43] then in February second he told me to go
[24:46] down in the basement and get faith to
[24:48] faith and I did that and then he told me
[24:51] in next week a February eighth to go
[24:54] down in the basement and look for the
[24:56] easter tapes and I found those and then
[24:58] I began to look at 81 and I've seen a
[25:01] tape brother Joseph Coleman then I saw
[25:04] brother Jose Q I said Jose Q there must
[25:09] be can yours I said don't tell me that
[25:11] the Spanish on these tapes and that's
[25:14] how I found out put the tape on and then
[25:17] I found all the rest of the Spanish
[25:18] tapes so God did that himself I knew
[25:23] nothing about it at all forgotten all
[25:26] about it and was even in my mind so he's
[25:29] the one that brought out that 81 tapes
[25:32] catch it now in 2004
[25:36] he could have brought it up in 2005 or
[25:39] 2006 maybe but he brought it in 2004 and
[25:42] since his for then we had to go to pen
[25:45] Harris the same as we did 81
[25:48] will be marched over to Jerusalem but
[25:52] this time we hit the third phase and it
[25:56] connected with the third pole the
[25:59] opening of the words of mr. Seville so
[26:02] we are here
[26:04] praise God were here so now we can
[26:08] understand from 81 he may be seated
[26:10] before the beginning in the beginning
[26:12] from the beginning the three things who
[26:14] God is who you are who Satan is in this
[26:17] revelation is what will connect you into
[26:20] way back before you cannot be reborn
[26:24] unless you were there enough as a
[26:27] thought they are the only ones that can
[26:30] be reborn because you had to be there
[26:34] and you had to be in a lamb's book of
[26:36] life as a word see and now you can be
[26:40] reborn and it pleased God amen now
[26:44] listen to tell you something you may be
[26:46] seated because of Adam and Eve we had to
[26:51] come here our bodies laid in the dust
[26:53] and because Adam had the book of life in
[26:57] him which is the theophany and he would
[26:59] have spoke the seeds of God in their
[27:02] generations Adam would have done that
[27:05] but because of the sin of Eve and Adam
[27:08] therefore we had to come through the
[27:11] flesh are you following me
[27:13] could we had to bypass off the Alpha
[27:15] knees come here so what I'm trying to
[27:18] tell you to get rid of the guilt complex
[27:21] on you other words God thought of us in
[27:24] this mine predestinated us called us
[27:29] justified us and already glorified us
[27:34] [Applause]
[27:35] amen and the only reason you came here
[27:40] is because of Adam and Eve so then that
[27:42] means that all the things that you get
[27:45] in your life that has transpired in your
[27:48] lives the only reason that anybody knows
[27:50] anything about it because of Adam and
[27:52] Eve
[27:52] it was very dominating ever been here at
[27:56] all
[27:57] and that's why he justifies you you
[28:01] never did it in the first place
[28:05] that's the only way you can understand
[28:07] it amen
[28:09] you all free and he when the son of man
[28:13] set free is free indeed
[28:17] amen so we're here so you may be seated
[28:24] glory Hey
[28:26] [Applause]
[28:31] that's why God could do that
[28:33] do you understand now that's why the
[28:36] woman at the well he went to her because
[28:40] she was white in heaven and black on air
[28:42] but she was not black on earth she was
[28:44] white on earth also so catched on faith
[28:52] to know who you are
[28:55] amen we want to have a seventh on the
[28:58] revival amen
[29:02] [Applause]
[29:06] okay you may be seated so now as 1981
[29:12] did it because identified a fire for
[29:14] ministry well that as it did in 81 then
[29:18] 2004 would be now and it'd be a sign of
[29:22] the fivefold ministry a portion of it it
[29:25] meant being identified soul there's your
[29:28] testimony anyway all right so now 1982
[29:33] will let be assigned Ephesians 4:13 a
[29:37] ministry stepping forward from around
[29:39] the world
[29:40] and people from around the world coming
[29:43] forth some beginning to be adopted they
[29:46] have next shift the Lord tarries will
[29:48] see amen
[29:50] I don't know could be okay today's tape
[29:55] my father working Hitler to network and
[29:57] as I said it was the same day as to know
[30:00] him from the beginning
[30:01] and these two messages are on adoption

[30:23] through Malachi for in human skin he
[30:26] comes back as dynamic sunlit so church
[30:29] are you now on the third phase so church
[30:32] you you are now on the third phase
[30:34] officially
[30:36] and this is a message to everybody
[30:38] ministers elders deacons rushes sown
[30:40] leaders quiet
[30:42] musicians helps governments you're now
[30:44] entering your place of trying and and
[30:48] here is gonna be child training tutoring
[30:50] sanctification instructions and
[30:52] righteousness seasoning correction
[30:54] reproof etc so we've back to the Bible
[30:57] back to the beginning back to the word
[31:00] eat the whole role amen so therefore we
[31:06] are here and I will be because
[31:10] addressing a lot of issues in the church
[31:12] new york and pennsylvania right on the
[31:14] spot just speak right to you
[31:17] can you supposed to be here as a seed of
[31:19] god it's supposed to be a ripe you're
[31:23] supposed to be ready to be drying out
[31:25] with excess moisture so any excess
[31:28] moisture I see I'll bring some hot Sun
[31:31] the word to dry it out
[31:35] [Applause]
[31:38] so yesterday I will be I will be
[31:41] addressing that laid-back you know well
[31:44] you know you know that's been here since
[31:47] 1998 will now leave and as I'm healed
[31:51] and start to clean up Pennsylvania in
[31:54] New York also we are getting ready to
[31:57] build a new church in Pennsylvania I
[31:59] won't have a meetin soon as I'm healed
[32:01] and get down there and I assure you that
[32:04] that a spirit will not be in the church
[32:08] president nor will to be in a new church
[32:10] well amen and you're going to make
[32:13] mistakes now everybody was going to make
[32:15] mistakes
[32:15] Peter was adopted and he made a mistake
[32:18] and he went down to Antioch where they
[32:22] had multi-racial and there and then
[32:26] certain Jews come down there to try to
[32:29] make those Gentiles keep the law and it
[32:32] was even keeping the law themselves so
[32:35] Peter and also Barnabas got carried away
[32:37] with the whole thing there but thank God
[32:40] Paul saved the Church of the Living God
[32:43] to take it away from the legalism kept
[32:46] it under grace amen
[32:50] so many things like that there you will
[32:52] make mistakes too brother branham said
[32:54] it was not Peters doctrine and
[32:56] difference with Paul
[32:58] it was Peters behavior that was in
[33:00] question so place of trying is to
[33:04] sanctify as you know you know without
[33:06] behavior and seasoning and everything
[33:10] else so you're going to make mistakes
[33:11] now and see but because you are in
[33:15] training you will make mistakes so and
[33:19] then no praise demons and all spirits
[33:21] will leave both churches there's
[33:24] something about New York City what will
[33:26] it be
[33:27] it'll be a manifestation of the
[33:30] revelation of November 1064 Joseph's
[33:33] perfection finally Joseph's perfection
[33:35] rainbow coat
[33:36] finally on display a perfect man
[33:39] ephesians 4 11 through 13
