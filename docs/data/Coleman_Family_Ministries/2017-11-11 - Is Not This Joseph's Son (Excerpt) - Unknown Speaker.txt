where does it come in here well let's read page 45 statue a perfect man now please under tape whatever more I'm not teaching as a doctrine he says here I just want to show you that by the help of God what it really is that the first Bible I ever wrote was the zodiac in the sky started with the Virgin and ends up with Leoville the lion when I get to that to sixth and seventh seal you find out when that other seal was open the zodiac mark of that place was the cross fish that's cancer age we're living in now revealed then the cancer each's xi sad and lille the line is a 12 sign so the god dropped the revelation of the seventh seal in on cancer normal Evan he giveth and giveth more grace don't you understand when the nitwit ism is almost filled up and you can't do it no more that's when he rides in with grace because he don't want you to do it it's his great than you can bring you ain't bragging around here I did this I ain't nothing but the grace of God did it the same grace of God that justified Luther sanctified Wesley wasn't that that they did and and baptized a Pentecostal will make you perfect ain't no feeling is what guys already done oh it don't try to get around the grace of God the cross fish that's the age we live in and reveal the next thing to steal tore it revealed leo the lion scent coming of Christ he comes the first to the version next to Leo the Lion I'll bring this through amen says that the first Bible was zodiacs second Bible excuse me pyramid and then the third of course is a word the Bible as we have it now oh my church the friends where are

kill you you're his son that's your father the devil takes you to Mount Sinai but God the grace takes you to Calvary my don't go to melon Santa you'll be condemned with the law Laura okay brethren page 438 paragraph 64 what a beautiful now he speaks on easy I'm a paraphrase light of this here I don't want you tie him up you see Kia nine but the inkhorn riders the for the angels there and one of those angel was an in corn right and he had to go through the city and they had to slaughter everything in there when four men with slaughtering weapons they went forth to slaughter every everything through the city and before they went to slaughter a man or rider came with a inkhorn the riders inc on either side just in white he said don't go into the city don't slaughter anything until first you have sealed the servants of God in forehead and he went forth and he seal even said two little chilled everything else sealing them and then the ones with the slaughtering weapons for them come and went in and absolutely demolished everything had no pity they slaughtered man women children and everything that had not to seal the first man with the inkhorn rider that sealed away amen and then he brings over to Matthew 24 you know about Titus Amen and how a message a revealed Word message went forth by Jesus and the Apostles in them and told him when you see Jesus said it when you see Jerusalem compassed about what armies get out and tires and moved in and the bride that was in the city couldn't get out but they said but then he made a way of escape because he said so the way of escape would come only when you would see Jerusalem compassed about definitely seen Jerusalem compassed about the bride didn't have fear they have they had joy we're going home on the morning train don't you see titles look at looking room looking room look at him we're going on there and what are you worrying about today when you see these Devils up and down the street lift up your head look up your Redemption 2a9 you going right here don't you have no fear is God's grace to you walk down the street go to your child singing the grace of God thank you teeth go on the subway hallelujah space of God go to your home the grace of God what are you worried about the God's praises for you I don't care how many mistakes you made come back come back come back [Applause] my lord maybe see the page 440 MA Erica said me too now we see the abomination make a desolation standing the holy place now then in the days of the coming of tires after Jesus had left the Holy Spirit was that man with the ink point at his side and he went future rules him instead of mark upon the people now I want you to notice something church member and you claim to have the holy spirit he said don't steal any of them but then that sigh and cry for the abominations that's done in the city Jerusalem and it's a rule this is a church so I cried inside and this Jerusalem here against dominations why because I wanted to be sealed not because I'm mean and mad at you I want to have a place for the headstone to come round in the crown so I had to cut in jump and whatever please forgive me for trying to make you perfect is there not a cause what have I done what have had done but preach the word is there not a cause shall the devil take the whole thing is there not a cause why you uncircumcised philistine these look got children I don't care they're mad at me when our whack their hunts but I know in there when I get those Devils off of them they want to throw their hands up again to praise God begin to worship and thank the Lord is there not a cause now you understand me now I'm not so mean all right I'm your friend Joseph Joseph Coleman I mean a man all my I don't seal any of them only those that cry inside against filth in the church against gossip and filth seal those who's against that stuff chlorine and cry against abomination three and old God help brother call me Lord get them sent to preach Lord hey where's anybody so burned about the world now on their condition well our myth has I'm bad but I'm in the message I got tapes and books or not that constant burden for the loss that sweetness don't never let anything rise up and put bitterness in your soul no matter how bad anyone ever treats you or anything don't never don't be guilty of letting that thing anchor in your soul it'll grieve the Holy Spirit lady no matter what the test is and I've been through some real tests it's got this past year but ain't no business on anchor here brother I mean to see Jesus I must see Jesus I will see Jesus we shall see the king [Applause] whoa burden for the loss okay god bless you amen I'm almost finished here the ministry of Christ must be here to catch the headstone so the profit is gone but we got to bring the ministry back in and place it now once let's watch Jesus he had the fullness of the Holy Ghost that did at the Jordan River then he went into the wilderness to be tested because God cannot give you the power unless you're tested so his character had to be test and he oh he defeated the devil by the word his written is written is written is written so st. Luke 4:14 he come out of the wilderness with the power that he went in there with but he had a season when he didn't use the signs and wonders and miracles he just used the power of the word so when he defeated the devil by the power of the word about 1984 there's not another spirit moving because had he used the power between 74 and 84 be whole lot of people in here [Applause] is that wonderful but he used the word is written is written in written you shall be filled glory speak the word for Timothy it happened it's a promise they don't want that they walk away glory then Jesus returned in the power here he come down to the temple walks into the temple returned and power the PALS upon but he can't use it yet until he identifies the season [Applause] can't use it yet until a third phase is a 10:05 amen okay how long you wait until this shall be healed don't worry it's gotta be identified he's ready for his music but he got to go to Temple first and after this defeating the Satan by the word three wall attacks he walks into the temple to identify the season then there's the worry to went in there did the priest hand him in the Bible the scrolls aim in the scriptures and he went to Isaiah 61 the spear Lord's upon me set the captives free and so forth and he was sick whatever so he had to identify the anointing that was on him in the word and his hometown then the word was struck by the anointing in the temple glory he pick up the book and read from his ayahs 61 and stopped at a comma the acceptable year of the Lord and it didn't end the day avenges he cut off right there and acceptable year Lord is Jubilee he's come to bring a Jubilee to the captive Jews that was free I mean that was barren and by pharisees and sadducees my prayers come as sin he closed the book at all eyes was upon him and he began to say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears their minds was blown they didn't know who is there all bear witness and wondered at the gracious words spoken from his mouth they were confused on that day and they said is not this Joseph's son who gives him the authority to speak like this who do you think he is I mean he's one of us right here who is he is not this Joseph's son and he began to strengthen his claims and they wondered they got man did any wondering what right does he have a do so-and-so who told him to do that who
