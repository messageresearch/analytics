[0:00] so now I'm reading from second Timothy
[0:03] the third chapter xiii verse you all
[0:10] read with me what evil men no do the
[0:14] 12th fret I'm sorry
[0:15] yay and all that will live godly in
[0:19] Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution
[0:23] there's a will to do it there those who
[0:26] will do it did every now got to be your
[0:30] will to do it
[0:30] and if you do do it you shall suffer
[0:33] persecution see but evil men and
[0:37] seducers shall wax worse and worse
[0:40] deceiving and being deceived but
[0:44] continue thou in the things which thou
[0:46] has learned and has been assured of it's
[0:50] not wonderful praise God knowing of whom
[0:55] thou has learned them and that from a
[0:58] child thou has known deep the Holy
[1:02] Scriptures which are able to make thee
[1:05] wise unto salvation through faith which
[1:09] is in Christ Jesus all Scripture is
[1:12] given by inspiration of God and is
[1:16] profitable for doctrine for reproof for
[1:19] correction for instruction in
[1:22] righteousness that the man of God may be
[1:26] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[1:29] good works
[1:30] it allows a blessing to the reading of
[1:33] his word now I like to title this little
[1:37] thought don't surrender your faith if
[1:42] there was a time for the people of God
[1:46] to know in whom they have believed in
[1:49] this is the hour
[1:53] if there is other time for the people of
[1:56] God to stand for God staying in this
[2:00] hour this is the OL prepare was
[2:05] exhorting a Timothy here young ministers
[2:08] he was urging him come telling him to
[2:13] stand firm in the faith of Jesus Christ
[2:17] it is more timely for this age here for
[2:21] the same word of God opens by vindicated
[2:25] prophet Paul to come right back here now
[2:27] and be for this very age here now this
[2:30] most are deceiving age but while it is
[2:34] the most deceiving age when all shall
[2:37] worship the Beast whose names is not
[2:40] written in the bloody Lamb's Book the
[2:44] bleeding worse amen
[2:46] this is the age of the eagle Revelation
[2:49] God saved this anointing know that as
[2:55] we've been listening to custody seals
[2:56] how the white horse rider change horses
[3:00] over to a red horse rider geez / - a
[3:03] black horse rider and all three cars
[3:06] come together up on a pale horse right
[3:08] and this writer it was riding now -
[3:11] taking the people to destruction and
[3:14] Daniel 8 it said that this beast would
[3:17] rise up a power and he would deceive the
[3:21] whole world by flattery by saying peace
[3:25] teeth or even the man out of the street
[3:29] has drunk know that there's one man
[3:32] saying peace to the well amen and yet
[3:36] the chick sees him riding that pale
[3:38] horse saying peace peace even now
[3:41] speaking - Johnston Johnson going over
[3:44] there because President Johnson going
[3:46] over it because to see him and to fall
[3:49] down on his knees I suppose and kisses
[3:51] ring I see and then say that he himself
[3:55] will intercede and make peace this is a
[4:00] a great year coming up
[4:03] and we could spit out our here talking
[4:06] about or what has happened this year but
[4:08] all of us we have seen it happen it was
[4:11] spoken that it would happen because to
[4:14] the world we with our eyes have seen
[4:17] this world if education just completely
[4:21] because fall apart as a prophet preached
[4:24] about for years available hell is
[4:26] falling apart the flashing rips time
[4:29] amen and he even spoke then about those
[4:32] beetles coming forth and sixty-two those
[4:35] demons from the pit and here they are
[4:38] now starting all of these hippies and
[4:40] also flower power sawed off from those
[4:42] beetles their demons rising up here you
[4:45] see on our satellites we see all these
[4:48] things the church in Hope in Israel and
[4:50] so forth well Paul in this kind of
[4:54] atmosphere in this kind of turn pile is
[4:58] short Timothy by the word here the
[5:01] necessity for holding firmly to the
[5:04] faith he's shown him why see still he's
[5:08] telling because Timothy that it is the
[5:10] means by which God makes us live or the
[5:14] salvation the only way we can be why is
[5:19] through the switches overnighted to make
[5:30] us rise or the salvation these
[5:33] scriptures that God breathed up all and
[5:36] make them live this is for doctrine for
[5:40] reproof for correction for instruction
[5:44] in righteousness because holy living in
[5:48] conformity to God's thoughts in God's
[5:51] mind not who we think is holy well then
[5:53] God makes holy by his blood you haven't
[5:58] because many holy men the pulpit Allah
[6:00] but then are holy because in God's or a
[6:02] man's of blood of Jesus Christ makes you
[6:06] holy
[6:06] see so now God use this one channel to
[6:12] get the man's face amen
[6:15] he operates through faith see in his
[6:18] work so therefore it is through faith in
[6:22] God's words that we might be perfect
[6:27] complete because thoroughly furnished
[6:29] unto all good works that he's ready just
[6:33] about now - do you find me now he's just
[6:37] about ready for that bride to take one
[6:41] yeah right
[6:42] well he said God's prophets little state
[6:45] was Eden she'll turn at the West one day
[6:48] and she'll write back and she'll take
[6:51] one more breath right amen and God
[6:55] Himself will write in the brown the pale
[6:58] horse ride he's riding but there'll be
[7:00] one more ride these signs shall follow
[7:03] them that believe the Word of God so we
[7:06] see them that God there knows that the
[7:10] scriptures this restored faith that
[7:14] Malachi flow restored back is the only
[7:17] means that God can use to protect the
[7:21] bride he can't do it by no other means
[7:23] only through his word and Satan knows
[7:27] that so Satan comes against this word
[7:30] with darkness doctrines of devils to
[7:34] produce the Brad or a friend that only
[7:38] means she had to grow by the Word of God
[7:40] and therefore that is his job that's why
[7:44] we say don't surrender your faith don't
[7:47] give it up
[7:48] don't let your grease hair on the carts
[7:51] or changing heat
[7:54] this faith message is absolute to us
[7:59] amen it is the final amen
[8:02] Oh beer it is it is something now with
[8:06] all but thanks be to God we have an
[8:11] absolute we had we know what's going to
[8:17] happen we see it popping all around us
[8:19] we know that this wheel is now on the
[8:21] way out the tip is getting up now he's
[8:24] ready to ride you see them now just even
[8:27] ahead well but the bride when I will
[8:31] come don't do nothing stand still and
[8:34] see the salvation of your God don't you
[8:37] try to do anything yes you spin there
[8:41] and behold the glory of God all around
[8:44] amen and God shall fight your battles
[8:47] don't get scared
[8:50] don't get nervous just spin there and
[8:53] say glory to God the prophets spoke it
[8:55] now here it is I know my heart is able a
[9:01] men and I will not bow down to any bales
[9:04] out here amen and if we assume in the
[9:07] fire and let God put me in there it's
[9:10] his will it is will be done for yourself
[9:12] God why we should not because they're in
[9:16] our faith like I say the only means by
[9:19] which God can protect us that's why it
[9:23] is the mean which while he can use to
[9:25] change the practice from image into his
[9:29] image from well glory to another go
[9:33] there's only through the word for as
[9:37] we've been hearing beware in a glass we
[9:40] were changed even as by the Spirit of
[9:43] the Lord and the spirit of the law have
[9:46] come down in in Word form no message
[9:49] that's why if you can't that was why
[9:52] over the word to read the word the word
[9:54] gives the Holy Spirit that's why it's
[9:58] the word
[9:59] so Isis in there the paw patroller he
[10:03] prophesized of token get out of the
[10:06] package
[10:07] it wasn't there yet but it was coming
[10:09] the tapping was a ton of man to reveal
[10:13] himself and Apostle worked out their
[10:15] last piece not my vision by Satan to the
[10:18] token is here alright and if you must
[10:21] have a detector because it kind of come
[10:24] on the scene those son of man come down
[10:26] and reveal himself
[10:28] don't worry a car that's this friend as
[10:31] the sixth year was open up they come
[10:34] down by vision came in all right when
[10:38] the vision come something was spoken
[10:42] from that vision the Word of God
[10:46] well then Word of God reveal each vision
[10:50] para so the word of the Lord told us it
[10:54] was the portal was a white horse riding
[10:56] so forth the word of the Lord told it
[11:00] that it was those dude on the altar it
[11:03] was the word of the Lord so then each
[11:06] seal was broken by the word amen it was
[11:10] the word of the Lord that told what was
[11:12] hit in the sixth seal then wrath any man
[11:16] now
[11:16] well then why is everybody's fall
[11:19] because Christine who's with the seventh
[11:22] seal just like he did with seal one two
[11:36] three four five and six been the rule of
[11:39] law and with the widow or the prophets
[11:42] beginning out on tape and there it is
[11:44] just like it's on tape the first seal
[11:46] the second to third to fourth to sixth
[11:48] the fifth it's the same thing and now
[11:50] the seventh seal is on tape oh ho don't
[11:53] worry wait long
[11:55] amen well we praise God just a minute
[12:01] because we get so excited we forgot to
[12:03] because I acknowledge system are--in the
[12:05] back here Cyrillic her daughter here we
[12:08] sure want to welcome you back sister
[12:09] Marie have my mind set just on this
[12:11] message is
[12:13] so now we see friends that we are not to
[12:16] surrender our faith for this place is
[12:20] the word faith is the revelation of
[12:25] God's will
[12:28] well then God's will came in the form of
[12:31] a message on tape then if you want to
[12:35] know what to do further
[12:37] h-here the tape read the Bible story so
[12:41] then write to me go now he told that we
[12:47] would be changed into his image even as
[12:50] by the Spirit of the Lord in Word form
[12:53] you father now and I still don't because
[12:57] of the gift for him you follow me now
[12:58] this time is the word for things and
[13:01] works for me now Timothy is warned that
[13:05] he won't have an easy time of it please
[13:09] amen
[13:11] he must stay like a rock I guess because
[13:14] increasingly cuz period waves of error
[13:17] that will beat against him
[13:20] that's why he says Christ says build
[13:23] your house on a rock when the waves come
[13:27] and the winds come and shake that half
[13:31] moon and the rock is Christ and we seem
[13:38] to be in this power of many houses
[13:41] falling now being blown down can be
[13:44] because Paul wonders that right there's
[13:47] a bear of the arrow coming deceivers who
[13:52] shall wax worse and worse they will go
[13:55] forth because bad to work being deceived
[13:59] and also just ceasing be a little spare
[14:03] yourselves by doctors because of devils
[14:06] and leading others away seducing spirits
[14:10] that the prophet sent is all religious
[14:14] people good people good people there are
[14:18] deceived with religious spirit upon and
[14:23] that's why this age is nothing but the
[14:26] where amen you sometime
[14:30] praise God for he said that he would see
[14:34] the rise of the worst immorality and
[14:39] wickedness in the world but I've said in
[14:44] the church that's where you'll see in
[14:48] the church and it's got to be in the
[14:50] word for Christ himself in the bigger a
[14:53] revelation
[14:54] Sidley I see is black healthy nasty all
[15:00] right
[15:00] and he spew out of her mouth now it's
[15:04] the same age the layoff the age was when
[15:08] every man did what he thought was right
[15:11] because of his own I see just like back
[15:15] in the tire law of judges every may have
[15:18] own doctrine please why because there
[15:21] was no profit on the singing to get God
[15:26] gives his will to the profit to work so
[15:29] back in judges God raised up your spies
[15:33] and those who because what would because
[15:35] thought of to prove his point just like
[15:39] he did those Pentecostal didn't mean now
[15:42] that's why he had a woman who was
[15:44] despised back there because Deborah a
[15:47] left-handed because assassin because
[15:49] giddy on different ones because it
[15:52] wasn't thought of much you follow me now
[15:54] what he does that see but also just
[15:59] about the end of judges because you had
[16:02] Eli priests and he had a because for two
[16:06] son and they was the priest and held a
[16:10] filthy aged in because there is no
[16:13] profit on the scene it kidding me now
[16:16] so we've seen in that guard people they
[16:18] always go spring see there's three
[16:22] things that happened the people go
[16:23] astray then a man of God from nowhere
[16:27] rises on the scene with a message from
[16:31] God because they could for the remedy
[16:34] enemy now then you can choose to take
[16:37] that remedy or you
[16:39] spit it out up to you then the next
[16:42] thing that happens after that traffic
[16:44] comes on the scene this God comes down
[16:48] himself here deliverance yeah it always
[16:52] happens that way he comes down himself
[16:54] he will deliver you himself so he comes
[16:59] down 40 couple delivery see to me now so
[17:02] therefore those priests back there they
[17:05] were laying with with the women right FD
[17:07] tika temple gates there and same age now
[17:12] Satan women popular the gospel money see
[17:16] and it was because filthy even here
[17:20] today movies TV books miniskirts sex is
[17:25] on the rampage that's all out there for
[17:28] Satan is using his to the woman you see
[17:32] the me announce see and he's taking the
[17:34] whole world into destruction then if
[17:38] Satan can get into the church he can
[17:42] anoint spirit man to come against the
[17:47] Ministry of the word of God through any
[17:50] means he can any always use of D three
[17:54] avenues Samson with women their money
[17:58] their popularity amen
[18:01] but the man of God you hate that man of
[18:19] God they're going to preach that work
[18:23] because like people like priests they
[18:26] want to heap to themselves teachers
[18:28] could have an engineer's also because
[18:32] accumulate to themselves teachers what
[18:34] God told us back in 1st Samuel 3 that
[18:38] when he speaks your ears will be tickle
[18:41] a table
[18:42] God says there and a Pingo
[18:45] right please pick this handle tamio and
[18:49] - notice God called him three times and
[18:54] ers that when a car to the spare time
[18:57] listen for God is ready to speak and in
[19:00] Godspell
[19:01] Samuel Samuel and Here I am Lord speak
[19:04] to that servant do you see the pail was
[19:10] ready to speak and we have service -
[19:13] here we are Lord speak
[19:15] and God says what I'm about to sing will
[19:18] ping on your ear it won't pick on them
[19:21] it'll be so powerful brother you'll see
[19:24] if they come off faith cometh by hearing
[19:26] hearing right to ear to hear the word of
[19:29] come amen
[19:31] so we see the enemy rather pick up on
[19:35] the scene all that live godly in christ
[19:38] will suffer persecution they will meet
[19:41] persecution don't use big because you
[19:44] won't meet it because the Bible says you
[19:46] will meet
[19:47] amen see you meet it because of your
[19:50] stand forward in time if you're standing
[19:56] for righteousness the church people they
[19:59] will hate you Esau didn't say a thing
[20:03] take it you just wait to their learning
[20:07] days are over
[20:08] is that right the Prophet died at 65 in
[20:13] about June 66 he said when asked the
[20:16] Jacob when they saw that the Prophet was
[20:19] wanna rise in a power resurrection
[20:22] there's a profit here already spoken
[20:25] already the seats are not there with the
[20:28] shock and then those spirits begin the
[20:31] class is the spoken word has it already
[20:34] gotta be Luther head to Bible well
[20:38] where'd that he was a priest but the
[20:40] word with close to him I meant nothing
[20:44] is there 29 hold your peace because I'll
[20:47] get it
[20:48] just a minute miles will take my time
[20:50] this morning
[20:52] amen because now feel good now wonder
[20:58] crazy outcry they are joking but not
[21:02] with wine this dagger but that was
[21:04] strong drink for the Lord is poured out
[21:07] upon you the spirit of deep sleep and
[21:09] hair close your eyes the prophets and
[21:12] your rule is to save happy covered now
[21:15] matters and the vision of all is
[21:18] becoming to you as the words of a book
[21:20] that is sealed is that right and in
[21:25] which could men deliver to one that is
[21:27] learn saying read this I pray thee and
[21:30] he said I cannot foresee the promise
[21:44] with the Word of God and the battement
[21:47] get it when he said that it must be a
[21:50] secret it must be because if I put it in
[21:54] secret Satan if he should get a hold of
[21:57] it
[21:58] oh he would impersonate it so the
[22:02] seventh seal the coming of Christ month
[22:04] they have already gone forth in secret
[22:07] it's a word for if Satan could get ahead
[22:10] of that fateful if he can only get it so
[22:13] now he said what is it
[22:15] see it's the word and if I don't know
[22:19] God made a poster whereas what
[22:21] understand because because she has the
[22:24] Word of God for like I say because the
[22:27] enemy uses
[22:29] money popularity and women is so forth
[22:32] see and we know that if a man will stand
[22:36] tied to this word he can't fail for the
[22:40] word of the absolute the terrible the
[22:43] rock that we stand on and no matter who
[22:47] says what their fingers because the hard
[22:50] faces touch your face against our made
[22:53] you are praised in the war or dispensed
[22:56] city I'm pillar dear my head your face
[23:00] and preach my word and Gemma I can't
[23:03] hold it back Lord his fire sharp in my
[23:07] home the word is high he's pleased as
[23:10] anything with the pride of the word of
[23:11] God amen the right friend so we see
[23:15] there that the word preached and then
[23:18] each member here works in the condition
[23:21] of the Word of God in the condition of
[23:24] the we're not because in your own minds
[23:27] now I see what he says Oh things'll
[23:31] Apple Paul says the rest everything is
[23:35] permissible because from be allowable
[23:37] the colossal see but not a things are
[23:40] helpful amen
[23:43] see good because expedient see because
[23:47] profitable when considered with other
[23:50] things now whatever is your desire this
[23:54] day consider first the Word of God with
[23:58] other things see go past it everything
[24:02] is lawful because for me he even said
[24:04] over in Frisco atheist 9 1 through 6
[24:07] he said because can I lead about a wife
[24:09] or sister like you
[24:11] because Peter so forth because Kate I
[24:14] had eaten great and also because was
[24:16] because money cooperation says well
[24:19] what's the power was thanks to find
[24:23] himself Stephan himself apart those
[24:26] things because there they were due to
[24:28] ministry but power wants to do some more
[24:31] for God
[24:33] see me now it was laughable but in his
[24:36] case he was trying to set a pattern an
[24:39] example and therefore it was not
[24:42] expedient I see just like today is
[24:46] laughable for men and also women because
[24:48] they have husband and wives that's
[24:50] laughable what is that experience in the
[24:54] south that's what you got to understand
[24:56] and that's why you have so much because
[24:59] trouble day in the trenches so forth
[25:01] I want a husband become one away for
[25:03] whatever it is is that's laughs well
[25:06] yeah but is that expedient in this hour
[25:09] check out God's will then you know if
[25:13] you're moving in the right spirit and so
[25:16] many people do you see Jesus Christ he's
[25:21] tipped the example he goes for his bride
[25:25] amen the man goes for the bath Christ
[25:31] comes down is swoops down for his bride
[25:34] one here went over there to over there
[25:37] these foolish virgins see they go for
[25:41] the man you found it out what they go
[25:46] for the man part spiritual part flesh
[25:49] pad in the world power religious you
[25:53] follow me now see what the true bride
[25:56] beyond the mere cords of that were the
[25:59] will of God
[26:00] what do you want me to do long hair my
[26:03] speak thing for therefore any man if he
[26:08] living because for his bride he will
[26:10] good for his own bride yeah Christ went
[26:15] for his bride any man wants to go for it
[26:18] alright but other things are laughable
[26:21] but they're not expedient and I see so
[26:24] much today or people want this and want
[26:27] invest
[26:27] he leads the camp because I haven't
[26:30] perfect and all things shall be added
[26:33] onto us
[26:35] hey speakin one time twice no keep on
[26:40] seeking why for the worse is after you

[28:24] Miriam so for C so therefore left over
[28:28] here let's hit the cone here hate to say
[28:31] this here but they could have to say it
[28:32] and here we try to do all that we can to
[28:37] stay clean and a priest aware that God
[28:40] and this is the age where the devil will
[28:43] use women this precious sister sent here
[28:46] but there's they up there singing and
[28:49] praising God a man consecrated call of
[28:53] God this wrathful because for him to
[28:56] have a wife
[28:56] is it experience because here in his
[28:59] condition God has kept an eye the army
[29:02] become he don't have a wife tell me now
[29:05] well he's in camp on him here servant is
[29:09] here if he wants to because take a wife
[29:11] did it he goes so he knows his will
[29:14] God's will he speaks that will every day
[29:17] but this Paul a woman come in here she's
[29:20] looking like this here
[29:21] timid the gonna blame her ass alright
[29:24] send me now well she's looking dark
[29:27] anything so what is happening her desire
[29:30] to the female its striking him and I'm
[29:35] sitting right here looking at the whole
[29:36] thing and she's looking at his striking
[29:39] him the next thing you know he'll fix
[29:41] problem is in his mind and thickness got
[29:44] him then he can't sing the wall because
[29:47] it can't play no more or you finally
[29:49] free these things must be sense when you
[29:52] understand that this is hardly any kids
[29:55] break up a church deacon ministers and
[29:59] so forth you've been over this back and
[30:00] forth and back and forth but that had no
[30:03] way of doing it
[30:04] there's better Eddie right here and
[30:06] sister of Deacon iris he come to me and
[30:09] tell me then he because what he has his
[30:12] hard for her I never you know anything
[30:14] about it that's what it was done that
[30:17] does it today we know that does the
[30:20] thing it just happens like that what he
[30:23] tell me he wanted hair so he went
[30:26] together and any man nothing then he
[30:29] goes to get his wife she don't run after
[30:32] him now he goes he goes to get her and
[30:36] also because she don't tell everybody
[30:37] the whole church she tells God and if
[30:41] that's that last wife before the
[30:43] foundation of the world God he's got
[30:45] something in there for her she could be
[30:48] ugly she could be any kind of cuddle
[30:51] whatever it is but he must have
[30:53] something here
[30:54] for that woman then they just come
[30:57] together naturally and God does the same
[30:59] to me now for therefore the deal I
[31:03] preached they wouldn't tell the people
[31:05] that they live with those women
[31:08] physically so forth and today's
[31:10] spiritually these hath Christ well tell
[31:13] them either spiritually they just take
[31:16] the money and do what they want to do
[31:17] see so we say all these things that we
[31:21] approach this new year reverently this
[31:25] is God's house in here you want to keep
[31:27] this place clean this pet that is
[31:30] dedicated to the way to reverence in
[31:33] God's hands not the hell out of Fortune

[31:38] of God do you mean them God has blessed
[31:41] us here above and beyond where we have
[31:44] tried to feed tied to the Word of God
[31:47] see right there see so now I can say all
[31:50] things are lawful
[31:51] what is it expedient you check that out
[31:55] see so now we see friends that like I
[31:58] say Christ goes the hunt for his own
[32:01] bride see now he said because Timothy
[32:03] they will tried to pass on you dear
[32:06] Anka's era see which opposes the
[32:09] doctrines see little did we know that in
[32:14] this hour we because the DVB prophet
[32:18] told us but my eyes in my ears have seen
[32:22] people in this message that you know us
[32:26] on the phone by letter brother colony on
[32:30] minutes on the phone oh because about
[32:31] two months ago told me that nobody has
[32:35] the Holy Ghost and this same man turning
[32:39] ha he was telling what the Holy Ghost
[32:41] years ago turn right around says
[32:43] nobody's got it cuz he don't feel
[32:45] nothing on the phone brother I busted
[32:50] the way that got registry I said you
[32:52] don't haven't got it
[32:53] what don't you miss me recap I never
[32:57] recant
[32:58] in his heart here he goes in there he's
[33:03] been the one half at me so all these
[33:06] year then Christ against every kind of
[33:09] barren have come in here all kind of
[33:13] things have happened right here before
[33:14] your eyes but it's been the word hole in
[33:18] the word not looking at the couny people
[33:20] but looking at the way the guy hitting
[33:23] me now look at the word every spirit
[33:26] many popularity women a devil possess
[33:29] that inspire half accusation so come
[33:33] against the ministry here when it's been
[33:35] the work homeland on the Word of God
[33:38] amen so this brother it's in ears and so
[33:44] forth another one precious brother call
[33:47] me on the phone Tamara brother Joe don't
[33:49] you get deceived by this false love
[33:52] spirit about loving your brother
[33:54] business I was shocked beyond belief
[33:57] this man that I know him tell me I'll
[34:00] get a fast spear to love my brother's
[34:03] past ecumenism spirit so I said well
[34:07] brother all I know is that the virtue
[34:09] for this agent brotherly kindness that's
[34:12] the word therefore I can do so you
[34:15] for this very age of seven ratio is
[34:17] probably kinda yeah but it also says the
[34:20] little mini shall wax cold so his leg
[34:25] with waxing : what can I do but I know
[34:29] the brother in the master another one I
[34:31] just received a letter last week the
[34:34] week before last he told me he says now
[34:38] that he has a good to admit the
[34:41] conductor says he does not have the holy
[34:43] go now he can approach the statue of a
[34:47] perfect man so believe he's approach and
[34:51] it's broken
[34:52] he finally now he's dripping over where
[34:56] the toughest very message is the baptism
[35:00] of the holy ghost 3 he explained it that
[35:04] right that's the heart of his message
[35:06] you see the me now now is the word age
[35:08] and his brother says now that
[35:11] he sees that now he's the senior and
[35:15] doctrines of devils in the last days
[35:17] wine horse riders son of man doctor all
[35:20] kind we're at in the message over it who
[35:23] brother Brown over there a brother went
[35:25] over there with a dream and told other
[35:27] Brown that brother Branham was Jesus
[35:29] Christ a lot of Lord and the king of
[35:32] kings and preach this whole mess that's
[35:36] right the man is the seed so docking of
[35:38] a devil see my friends for therefore we
[35:42] see then all of these things happening
[35:44] now see but we see then that this is the
[35:48] album that we are not just facing
[35:50] because denying of this or that it is
[35:53] the complete repudiation of the
[35:57] Christian thing they are absolutely
[36:00] denying everything about it
[36:03] and the method has come already and
[36:06] there's a path for knowing that was
[36:08] arrived against it in the message
[36:11] friends in the message you see it now
[36:13] see 4 therefore God said that seducing
[36:17] spirits would be up on the people now
[36:20] many would have a form of godliness see
[36:23] what would deny the way then if they
[36:26] deny that nothing is now going on
[36:28] they're saying god is dead and this is a
[36:32] spirit that was taught it way back then
[36:35] if god is dead love is dead
[36:37] mercy is this brothers did have nothing
[36:40] here now till now for therefore pastor
[36:44] that they would deny the power of the
[36:47] word then the power of the word is now
[36:50] working in the breath changing her but
[36:54] they say no I don't feel nothing Mary
[36:58] Sarah fear me to come to the word not
[37:00] sensation see is the living hear me now
[37:04] or giving up here amen
[37:06] so he said from such turn away all right
[37:09] I'm touched because turn away David said
[37:13] in Psalm 11 if the Foundation's be
[37:15] destroyed what can the righteous do what
[37:19] can we do if this foundation that we
[37:21] have received back if it's destroyed
[37:23] what can you do
[37:25] men most miserable is that right that's
[37:28] exactly right
[37:29] but this founder he cannot be destroyed
[37:32] for God has pasted in a heart a man a
[37:35] man in the heart you see for therefore
[37:38] the surrender of your restored faith see
[37:41] them you know will make you lose love
[37:44] kindness mercy everything so love is not
[37:48] dead see no siree
[37:51] amen amen
[37:53] breathe God so now those who say nothing
[37:57] is going on now
[37:58] because because in effect they have seen
[38:00] God is dead and yet God's prophecy that
[38:03] the shot has come
[38:05] therefore see is dead in the message
[38:07] sister then they say love is dead also
[38:10] and now our love is not dead love is a
[38:14] virtue which is a seed now is growing
[38:16] amen
[38:17] love is not a human virtue that arises
[38:22] naturally human's heart Oh
[38:24] love is a plant a seed that God has
[38:29] planted in a in a heart of faith amen
[38:33] and that seed now is now growing now
[38:37] maturing now alright me right before you
[38:40] are and those who are manifesting that
[38:44] they are this because persecuted by
[38:47] those who don't have that I think that
[38:50] may what is going right now
[38:51] see so therefore this love is a plant
[38:54] that God has planted in the heart
[38:57] praise be to God don't surrender your
[39:00] faith friend no sir
[39:02] be kind one to one another and love ye
[39:05] one another
[39:06] Amen see now God will take care of you
[39:10] heaven and earth shall pass away but my
[39:12] words shall never pass away see God kiss
[39:17] will his worry I was listening to a tape

[51:18] the same thing that's the Lord immensely
[51:21] now so we see they got our mouth because
[51:24] they got all the clouds out of the way
[51:26] getting on fresh out as week in sequence
[51:30] like cuz right now they go around down
[51:33] see now go like I say a miracle now we
[51:36] all are waiting for this miracle to come
[51:38] right the miracle of the transformation
[51:41] praise our God the miracle that will be
[51:44] in a resurrection how would it be we're
[51:46] so so this is gonna be like don't touch
[51:49] take it out now just wait see but you
[51:52] got something to do before the miracle
[51:54] come act and believe the Word of God act
[51:59] on what has been spoken and and just
[52:01] believe it then watch the miracle go for
[52:04] you know go see the miracle of the
[52:06] rapture amen Paul a miracle how he's
[52:10] gonna do it see what he's gonna do it
[52:12] though see so now like we say Samuel
[52:17] there was one vision ahead and all of
[52:21] Israel knew that the word of the Lord
[52:23] with them one dish their vision the
[52:27] Prophet had tells the time thousands of
[52:30] visions and they still fight him dearly
[52:33] now get down one vision to the Jewish
[52:37] prophet and all Israel from Dan down to
[52:41] Bathsheba they all knew that's the word
[52:43] a lot was with him see and he had to
[52:47] speak it out and for therefore Eli was
[52:49] judged by a prophet and Samuel had to
[52:53] come and tell Eli exactly what that
[52:55] prophet says but when Samuel said it
[52:57] then God was placement in season then
[53:00] Simeon know so therefore because a hair
[53:03] I mean it's because Elijah said it
[53:05] because against a hair but then Mike
[53:07] replaced it in season C so God says it
[53:11] first come back over here and speaks it
[53:13] out into spoken word then fish
[53:15] justice ain't spoken worth checking out
[53:17] because because quickly made a line or
[53:19] was because Martin Luther he stays a
[53:22] priest and they had the Word of God
[53:24] could justification that couldn't do
[53:27] anything until he second when Martin
[53:30] Luther sketch out justification it lived
[53:32] in the heart said right he had to speak
[53:35] it first off and Wesley the Pentecostal
[53:38] narrow this ace now D rapture each the
[53:41] Prophet had to say because resurrection
[53:43] and also rapture all these things and
[53:45] now we see them coming to pass he had to
[53:47] speak it out first
[53:48] amen the see it male friend thanks now
[53:51] okay
[53:53] because in closing then I what I'm
[53:55] trying to say this morning I'm trying to
[53:58] say by God's grace that God is trying to
[54:02] get us to listen that's all well you see
[54:06] it's after because three times because
[54:08] he put a line knew that he told Samuel
[54:11] when he speaks again now you listen see
[54:14] for now because three poles
[54:17] God reveals his words in three and seven
[54:20] so we've seen the third Pole and the
[54:23] seventh angel this is three offenses now
[54:25] God's raised because so to Raziel its
[54:28] word and his word was revealed to me now
[54:32] be the Apostles and also early church
[54:35] learn to
[54:36] oh Christ as the head of the church and
[54:41] we can prove this thing you turn access
[54:43] team and we still why the head of the
[54:46] church now that was the prophets great
[54:49] revelation that let Christ the head have
[54:55] the preeminence in you cinema now just
[54:58] let them have deeper eminence in you we
[55:02] steal what x-15 that certain men which
[55:07] came down from Judea taught the Brethren
[55:09] instead except ye be circumcised after
[55:12] the man of Moses you cannot be same in
[55:14] now these were people indeed Jerusalem
[55:17] church all right and they had the people
[55:21] down at F though because Antioch all
[55:22] shook up down there and so much soul
[55:25] that Paul and Barnabas because they have
[55:28] arguments down and so forth and also
[55:30] disputing so then they had to go up to
[55:34] Jerusalem now we notice that also here
[55:38] Paul got up there and also testified to
[55:40] Peter testifies Barmes testified things
[55:42] explained them because about God and
[55:44] also chlorophyll on Gentiles and all the
[55:46] signs wonders and miracles so they call
[55:49] them listen then James the pastor of the
[55:52] church now watch this this is maybe we
[55:55] need to understand it you understand the
[55:57] Seventh Seal what no what is taking
[55:59] place now up to this time just prior to
[56:03] this the Holy Spirit was poured out upon
[56:06] the Gentiles that's the house of
[56:08] Cornelius then these brethren in the
[56:12] message see wanted them to be
[56:15] circumcised to be saved and the blood
[56:19] station
[56:20] but they had to be circumcised just like
[56:23] today you got to go out here to Arizona
[56:25] you got to bleed a fellow man you got to
[56:28] bleed white horse rider
[56:29] no after this this man that so all kind
[56:32] of crazy things
[56:32] jimin's you must do this here to be in
[56:34] the message is the same spirit
[56:36] same exact spirit thing for now okay in
[56:40] a time like that before that God spoke
[56:43] to the fathers because by the prophets
[56:45] when in the last days he speaks by Jesus
[56:48] Christ
[56:50] is the word that right alright James
[56:52] knows they had the word in them now here
[56:55] with men with the baptism of the Holy
[56:58] Ghost in them and they still have
[57:01] disputing here all right
[57:03] but what happened because they didn't
[57:05] have this the New Testament yet Paul has
[57:08] it and all here did you know well now
[57:10] the Holy Ghost must speak but when he
[57:14] speaks it must be according to the word
[57:16] for what James come forward here in the
[57:19] 13th verse and the sixth verse it says
[57:23] and apostles and elders came together
[57:25] forth to consider of this matter the
[57:28] 13th verse after they had held a peace
[57:31] James answered fan men and brethren
[57:34] hearken unto me Simeon has declared how
[57:38] God at the first did visit the Gentiles
[57:41] to take out of them a people the fourth
[57:44] name the cookie Nielsen MC now and to
[57:48] this the Spirit has done something
[57:51] already
[57:52] amen now watch him now and says this
[57:55] agree the words of the prophet but he's
[57:58] chicken what happened on those Gentiles
[58:01] with the Bible
[58:02] no matter if no matter how pulsating how
[58:06] many visions and dreams of what they
[58:08] felt if that's written in this word it
[58:11] was nothing to do with it see so okay
[58:15] and to disagree the words of the Prophet
[58:18] as it is written there is your written
[58:20] we're right there just written out thing
[58:22] and he goes on to explain because he
[58:24] quotes out of here from back here and
[58:27] one of the prophets because the aim is
[58:29] back yes right and he says it in all
[58:32] times because after if I will return and
[58:33] will build again the tabernacle days it
[58:35] which is falling down and I will build
[58:37] again the rooms thereof and I will set
[58:39] it up
[58:40] that's the residue of men might seek
[58:42] after the Lord and all the Gentiles upon
[58:44] whom my name is called fit the Lord who
[58:47] doeth all these things known unto God
[58:49] are to his works from the beginning on
[58:52] the world now he took the word of God
[58:56] and place it what the spirit had done
[58:58] see now
[59:01] then he declared his own now over Envy
[59:04] [Music]
[59:05] 28th verse now here's the words spoken
[59:09] because for the age for it seemed good
[59:12] to the Holy Ghost and to us and to us
[59:19] but they said because to the holy go
[59:21] first by the words we would say it
[59:24] seemed good or calm to what the prophet
[59:27] has spoken on the tape and to us because
[59:32] that was the Holy Spirit speaking you
[59:36] finally know things so therefore now
[59:39] notice and to us to lay upon you no
[59:42] greater burden than these necessary
[59:44] things that you have seen from meat off
[59:47] of the items is that in the words the
[59:49] sure is what the Holy Spirit speak you
[59:51] know he's to get what's in the way so
[59:54] what's on the tape is in the word
[59:55] finally now and so forth and from blood
[59:59] and from things strangled and Strumica
[1:00:01] fornication all that is in the Word of
[1:00:03] God
[1:00:04] Tim you know all right now Jesus being a
[1:00:09] head of the church steps it down by the
[1:00:12] written word so we just heard it see and
[1:00:15] he said to them but because by the Holy
[1:00:18] Ghost which was speaking out of James
[1:00:21] see now the written word and the Holy
[1:00:26] Spirit all because the goal is agreeing
[1:00:28] see now notice to accept the written
[1:00:32] words about the spirit can lead to a
[1:00:36] form of godliness see other words you
[1:00:39] say yes Malachi Forster this here and
[1:00:41] brother brannis will do all these things
[1:00:43] see and that's it see that's about the
[1:00:46] spirit you know what this because
[1:00:47] written were supposed to do with me what
[1:00:49] to accept the written word see by the
[1:00:52] spirit in you see the Spirit of God in
[1:00:57] you telling you and saying this so see
[1:01:00] and also by the Holy Spirit speaking
[1:01:03] that leads you into spiritual maturity
[1:01:05] but it must be in you yeah the Holy
[1:01:09] Spirit must be and you'll cease to speak
[1:01:11] because then you understand and it
[1:01:13] dovetails together
[1:01:14] do you follow me print all right this a
[1:01:18] kind of deep this I hope you understand
[1:01:20] it what is you can't explain it to me
[1:01:24] now
[1:01:24] but this was the pattern that's the
[1:01:27] early church sent for from the time
[1:01:30] James spoke that that's set in motion
[1:01:32] the time that because right after that
[1:01:34] because Paul went out and D because
[1:01:36] Gentile came in said alright what the
[1:01:39] Ford hairpin
[1:01:40] God allowed this mishmash to be and he
[1:01:43] might speak his word see how there's no
[1:01:45] so he allowed it let's see a mishmash
[1:01:48] for the word to come down and speak it
[1:01:51] out and put it in order now I've been
[1:01:54] that word is spoken then these things
[1:01:55] they can now happen exactly what
[1:01:57] happened for therefore the Holy Spirit
[1:02:00] now is speaking now in all matters now
[1:02:02] on all matters you see so what as we
[1:02:05] approached this because new year friends
[1:02:08] it's not long left here can you believe
[1:02:10] it there we see it put it but this is
[1:02:13] apparent to exhort you all things are
[1:02:17] lawful but please check it out with the
[1:02:21] word see if that's what God wants for
[1:02:25] you now because a bear can anoint you
[1:02:28] and you can even because record whole
[1:02:31] church for wanting the strange desires
[1:02:34] and so forth and even because natural
[1:02:36] desire cinema now so you'd be a normal
[1:02:38] spirit and unless God lift that spirit
[1:02:42] you'll never know it you will you'll be
[1:02:44] deceived
[1:02:44] you can be nice and kind and go right on
[1:02:47] but if the Lord doesn't lift that veil
[1:02:49] for you you never see it doesn't hit you
[1:02:52] you see me now for therefore many have
[1:02:55] it could wanted certain things and now
[1:02:57] they're sorry that's right just things
[1:03:00] they thought they wanted the same thing
[1:03:01] I always make sure to check that because
[1:03:04] filter out students because the Word of
[1:03:06] God
[1:03:06] I think advanced filter there are too
[1:03:09] late just because half has at least want
[1:03:12] to just come to church go to church see
[1:03:14] know or seek the Lord seek God sees so
[1:03:19] now um the method has come now if Satan
[1:03:24] is he could get because get ahold of it
[1:03:26] he could do great damage
[1:03:28] which we understand see what he can well
[1:03:30] God has hit it in the bride's so now we
[1:03:33] see then that the Seventh Seal message
[1:03:36] enclosing the Word of God has been
[1:03:40] spoken it's been spoken now because for
[1:03:43] this age many people thought it was a
[1:03:46] great thing to happen 10th this and
[1:03:49] hopeful and so on
[1:03:50] we don't because dispute that but we
[1:03:53] only say what he says he says any vision
[1:03:57] must be in the Word of God his vision
[1:03:59] said that no water with knowing better I
[1:04:03] then was a great secretly in there are
[1:04:06] seven sons of secrets lays beneath the
[1:04:08] seal see no one no one doesn't know it
[1:04:11] sing then he opened up the seventh seal
[1:04:14] rubbish Nate one and it was solid there
[1:04:17] was division dovetailing with the Word
[1:04:19] of God and no one would know it it
[1:04:21] wouldn't be are the kind of open vision
[1:04:23] taught it to the world out here see but
[1:04:26] the other learned other words when he
[1:04:28] said the white horse ride was the Pope
[1:04:30] the cove I know that now right but when
[1:04:33] he preached all this messages from 63 to
[1:04:36] 65 they still don't say anything
[1:04:38] so why is that then why is that they
[1:04:41] understand the second seal the second
[1:04:43] the first in fear but the seventh thing
[1:04:45] up and on the statement they said well
[1:04:47] people to do this here it's looking up
[1:04:49] the coast and the progress record is
[1:04:51] over here yet he did the same thing in
[1:04:53] the seventh year that didn't stick to
[1:04:55] that right see to me Mara he told it
[1:04:59] would be that way that's giving honor
[1:05:01] them they would brush it out in secret
[1:05:06] while you follow the whole that few
[1:05:09] because getting a nice new move 300
[1:05:12] there now brushing out what God gives in
[1:05:15] the policies he has given the week but
[1:05:18] you must because this out in your life
[1:05:20] see let that word come out of the shop
[1:05:23] you take it in your fresh away the chaff
[1:05:26] in the natural that right now in a
[1:05:28] spiritual just fresh here it must
[1:05:30] diamond and the Word of God inside must
[1:05:33] come out why his wife we see now the Son
[1:05:37] of man has revealed himself now God
[1:05:39] created man in his own image this image
[1:05:43] was lost in Adam's sin that right well
[1:05:47] he restored this image in the second
[1:05:49] Adam crack this image come back to
[1:05:52] because Alpher better right because back
[1:05:55] in the early church and that was the
[1:05:56] image of God in the early church then it
[1:05:59] was the Carissa Polycarp then it was
[1:06:02] lost but there's a cop and one glory
[1:06:06] that right because I bleed then a taco
[1:06:09] listen glory and also because of shift
[1:06:11] in now I have come back to the original
[1:06:14] glory
[1:06:15] what is right thing now is not because
[1:06:18] going abena seat is now a seat you are
[1:06:21] now a seat of God because I going to be
[1:06:23] seen for now we have changed into this
[1:06:26] image from one glory to another glory
[1:06:28] even as by the Spirit Lord
[1:06:31] now it is very easy for us to because
[1:06:34] for your own image what we think it
[1:06:36] should be in this hour now there's many
[1:06:38] spirits s dissing what it is now they're
[1:06:41] all around see me now so we can only say
[1:06:44] with hip in the Word of God here it must
[1:06:46] be in the word ago Amen all right it is
[1:06:50] the image of Christ that has been
[1:06:52] restored print the restoration because
[1:06:55] comes about by the Spirit of the Lord
[1:06:57] man now don't miss this friends the
[1:06:59] image of God has been restored to God's
[1:07:02] prophets he has restored the living
[1:07:05] image of Christ in human flesh upon the
[1:07:08] earth that's been seen see me now now is
[1:07:11] day by day see one state of gory took
[1:07:16] because to another one as we yield
[1:07:18] self so as you hear yourself you go from
[1:07:21] this lorry because of that Lord as you
[1:07:24] heal yourself see in this manner the
[1:07:26] life of Christ in earth gives
[1:07:29] expressions and words and deeds see that
[1:07:33] all might see that Jesus Christ is alive
[1:07:36] and resurrected in the bride and he is
[1:07:40] the word but right and he will shortly
[1:07:43] come to vindicate this word amen
[1:07:47] when it happens his words are heard his
[1:07:52] deed foreseen that right amen and the
[1:07:57] wisdom and the knowledge of God is
[1:07:59] revealed I thought it did you seven
[1:08:04] things yeah and this happened and
[1:08:06] William Branham the deeds were seen the
[1:08:09] words of spoken the wisdom and the
[1:08:12] knowledge come out and there it was
[1:08:15] there was God Himself and yep we thank
[1:08:18] God because in this hour now God has
[1:08:21] given us grace to understand this here
[1:08:24] so we say to you as we approach this new
[1:08:27] year there will be one more ride Jesus
[1:08:31] Christ will come down and rise to the
[1:08:34] same hearts all over again that he has
[1:08:36] already written again there will be one
[1:08:38] more ride and so until then until he
[1:08:42] actually makes that ride don't surrender
[1:08:44] on your face hey man hold to God's
[1:08:47] unchanging handprint let us not make any
[1:08:51] resolutions because for this new coming
[1:08:53] year here please let us ask God for
[1:08:55] mercy and let us ask him for great let
[1:08:59] us keep on asking him now so now we see
[1:09:02] them that I myself I want to rededicate
[1:09:08] because my whole life to reverence here
[1:09:11] in this pulpit and also because
[1:09:14] reverence is just word and try to live
[1:09:17] all it because I can live because of
[1:09:19] this because of this word of God here
[1:09:21] let Christ to live through me God make
[1:09:23] all kind of mistakes you see but I know
[1:09:26] this that there's a blood atonement
[1:09:27] there and as long as we try just try
[1:09:32] see me now Christ is with his word
[1:09:34] friends and we've all been because
[1:09:37] failure because we all we sought out
[1:09:39] last year wanted to do so much to the
[1:09:41] Lord this year it's all like because
[1:09:43] like broken glass down there city man
[1:09:45] now but God has put all of these pieces
[1:09:47] together you can put them together think
[1:09:50] so I believe that as we approach this
[1:09:53] new year that we should sincerely and
[1:09:56] really dedicate our lives to Christ all
[1:10:00] things are lawful but not everything is
[1:10:02] expedient and whatever the Lord wants
[1:10:06] you to have I say this because the wit
[1:10:09] come with it because Reverend he'll give
[1:10:12] it to you but to seek the Lord first
[1:10:14] and in could are your conversation among
[1:10:18] brothers and brothers and sisters and
[1:10:19] sisters and so forth let the words
[1:10:22] willing speak on the things of God did
[1:10:25] you mean now if you speak on carnal
[1:10:27] things and your conversations your walk
[1:10:30] in the flesh you sure will and you won't
[1:10:33] because create an atmosphere around you
[1:10:36] and you'll find that you'll walk in that
[1:10:38] atmosphere and when you come in here if
[1:10:41] you condemn anything that will be
[1:10:43] preached you see if and emcee see them
[1:10:47] you know what's for there for the bride
[1:10:49] I don't know how to say it to you but I
[1:10:53] just trying to we hear her try to say
[1:10:57] with this word please this pulpit here
[1:11:00] is holy is God's holy ground here we try
[1:11:04] to live the word and preach this word
[1:11:06] and also act on the word that you might
[1:11:09] see because he faints and it's word here
[1:11:11] I believe that this nothing does know
[1:11:15] there is no other message this message
[1:11:18] is the absolute in it I believe that
[1:11:21] Jesus Christ has have already come flip
[1:11:24] down on the earth already with a message
[1:11:28] to his people this has been because
[1:11:30] going on since the seventh seal message
[1:11:33] many still laugh and joke and jeff's and
[1:11:37] foolishness and so forth what has been
[1:11:39] the time of the investigation judgment
[1:11:42] so therefore
[1:11:44] he's so loving and so saying he would
[1:11:47] not slip up on you so without telling
[1:11:49] you first
[1:11:50] so he comes down in his profit highs and
[1:11:52] humility tells you what he wants you to
[1:11:55] do till his word see tell you so much
[1:11:59] because it could make your ears tingle
[1:12:00] then the people that's looking for
[1:12:03] something else they don't they miss that
[1:12:05] word all the time and they saying I'm
[1:12:08] under the blood but he told Eli no more
[1:12:11] will I'll purge out your iniquity all
[1:12:14] right
[1:12:15] the prophets hold that so therefore
[1:12:17] that's the same thing today the Prophet
[1:12:19] he's come along and told these foolish
[1:12:21] virgins you're not under the blood you
[1:12:24] see it now friend they're not under the
[1:12:25] blood they think they are because the
[1:12:28] blood perfect scene so therefore only
[1:12:32] the Bryant's heat up heat under the
[1:12:33] blood you see so therefore how much
[1:12:36] should we be thanking God that we have a
[1:12:39] clean place in where we can come and
[1:12:41] also hear the word of God see me now we
[1:12:44] want to try to keep this place clean
[1:12:46] we'll keep your desires clean and also
[1:12:50] holy when you're away from here and when
[1:12:54] you come in here you'll be looking for
[1:12:55] Jesus what are you looking for this year
[1:12:57] are you looking because are you looking
[1:12:59] for the Word of God
[1:13:00] are you looking for this for that thing
[1:13:02] look for the Word of God in your life
[1:13:05] look for Jesus Christ I'm just trying to
[1:13:08] exhort you to stand here and knowing
[1:13:11] that there's something 6:00 in the
[1:13:13] Hamptons and like I say we don't know
[1:13:16] where we will be next year for this we
[1:13:19] know we want to establish as we go forth
[1:13:23] that every man knows their own job and
[1:13:27] what it's supposed to do somehow because
[1:13:29] soon we may have to meet in homes and so
[1:13:32] we all know see me now but we thank God
[1:13:35] that we have had this this opportunity
[1:13:37] here
[1:13:38] you know that it's been three and a half
[1:13:41] years exactly that we've been here he
[1:13:44] says June 64 to cause jet cook because a
[1:13:49] December 67 Trina has yes exactly
[1:13:52] and last year I think we spoke to in
[1:13:56] June about this place here and so forth
[1:13:58] it's about three years then and we know
[1:14:01] that a ministry that's because the man
[1:14:04] will have and so forth it won't go off
[1:14:05] the cutting further than that see but
[1:14:07] this has been the Ministry of the word
[1:14:10] this grows on and on and on
[1:14:13] didn't mean now wasn't a shock ministry
[1:14:15] then the man still the Word of God but
[1:14:18] it's just one because you can't stop
[1:14:19] this see so we don't set any time limit
[1:14:23] we don't know see but we know that three
[1:14:26] and a half years has been we don't know
[1:14:28] the standards of the perfection in the
[1:14:30] Bible a between the hand speed I don't
[1:14:32] know you know now but you don't know
[1:14:33] where Tantra you don't know could have
[1:14:35] started from 66 65 you don't know didn't
[1:14:39] know but one thing that we do know
[1:14:41] 67 has finished many things there his
[1:14:45] wheels back the Pope is now riding the
[1:14:48] hippies black Paul flower power
[1:14:50] riots murders rapes we see all of these
[1:14:53] things is that right friend
[1:14:56] and here we have a chance now to come
[1:14:59] and also to hear the word of God those
[1:15:02] of you as sitting in here today if you
[1:15:04] have not been baptized in the name of
[1:15:06] Jesus Christ I exhort you friends just
[1:15:09] is because quick as you can
[1:15:10] if you understand and if God has
[1:15:12] revealed to your heart that he is the
[1:15:14] Lord the Christ in your life then you
[1:15:16] obey Him and be baptized in water in the
[1:15:19] name of Jesus Christ you may say Odegard
[1:15:21] believe god yes and they come and they
[1:15:23] stiffen it sickness it and they still
[1:15:26] get baptized and so forth things but if
[1:15:28] you say you are supposed to be a
[1:15:29] Christian then the first things what you
[1:15:31] have to do it you have to come and be
[1:15:33] baptized take on the name of the Lord
[1:15:35] Jesus Christ you see well now like I say
[1:15:38] in closing a few other things and
[1:15:41] wanting to say but I suppose that what's
[1:15:44] been said has has been said C so
[1:15:48] therefore um we pray at you understand
[1:15:52] our purpose our desire that how we
[1:15:55] wanted a witness ministry here to be the
[1:16:00] fruit of the prophets message it's been
[1:16:02] hard because you had to save many
[1:16:05] cutting things which you don't take back
[1:16:07] you never take back the Word of God
[1:16:10] no so don't ever do that thing you got
[1:16:12] to speak it by faith in other words
[1:16:14] don't even say it
[1:16:15] they never compromise with the word they
[1:16:18] just speak the words by face knowing
[1:16:20] that they won't understand it if nobody
[1:16:21] understands it you've got to have faith
[1:16:24] that you're speaking and God since you
[1:16:27] must have it and many left hands and
[1:16:30] we're gonna sing so yes you but their
[1:16:34] blood is up on your hand and until you
[1:16:37] say it then they see that the blood
[1:16:39] they're hanging against them that's why
[1:16:41] it must be said yes now you see why
[1:16:43] until Luther said it you can't speak it
[1:16:45] off with had to speak it out
[1:16:47] the Frog had just saying he had a hard
[1:16:49] message to bring known and wouldn't
[1:16:52] nobody understand what he was doing they
[1:16:54] wanted some other things a great healing
[1:16:56] ministry when he's bringing judgment
