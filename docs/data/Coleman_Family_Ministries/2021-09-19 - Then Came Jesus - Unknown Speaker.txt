blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah thank you lord thank you all thank you lord amen amen amen glory wonderful thank you lord then came jesus [Applause] hallelujah glory praise god god be praised [Applause] blessed be the name of the lord [Applause] [Music] amen hallelujah [Applause] what a difference a week makes hallelujah praise god amen amen [Applause] see you had the right song praise the lord picked out the right song brother paul when he up against the struggle that shatters all your dreams and your hopes have been cruelly crushed by satan's manifested schemes that's when many of you fold up in and put it in your suitcase and go gone down a road railroad track somewhere lost and feeling sorry for yourself and gone and you feel the urge within you to submit to earthly fears don't let the faith you're standing and seem to disappear hold on please don't give up praise god what should you do praise the lord he can work through those who praise him praise the lord for our god inhabits praise praise the lord for the chains that seem to bind you serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you when you praise him true but many can't get that revelation amen now satan is a liar and he wants to make us think that we are poppers when he knows himself we are children of the king see his only thing he can do friends he was defeated at calvary he was defeated so the only thing he can do is to work through your minds that you fail and god won't forgive you that's the only thing he can do and work through brothers and sisters flesh also amen to come against you amen but more seem to be defeated by what the devil tells them actually than other brothers and sisters bothering with them amen so he's a liar so lift now watch here's what i wanted to strike so lift up the mighty seal of faith for the battle must be won we know that jesus christ is risen so the works already done thank you that's what i was doing trying to do last week well praise god for the mighty seal of faith oh praise god now we're on the beam now brother praise god i invite you your attention to saint john 20th chapter revelation 8. i'm coming back and trying to finish up what the lord told me to do amen and my inspiration has been you know this year to try to get the message to most of these new people that come in here after 1980 and so they understand what this message is amen so i want to read from saint john 20 and i'll just pick up where i was at last week i never got over to saint john 20. uh i was detoured over to the royalty mayor somewhere about six hours of trying to hit the scriptures scriptures said and it was full unbelief and everything and then toward by the evening uh they constrained him to come in but he had upgraded them and rebuked him for the unbelief amen well praise god so we won't bother with that that was last week answer under the bridge as far as i'm concerned amen it's quite a time on the road to emmaus i don't want to get back on there again amen verse 24 uh but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord but he said unto them except this is thomas speaking now except i see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into the side notice his burden that's a heavy burden i will not believe that's a powerful revelation there huh i will not believe mean and arrogance say i'm not going to believe it see what you're facing here i will not believe them thunders i will not believe in perfection no i will not he's a believer though amen praise god he's in the message man so uh he he laid out his his his uh theses here amen praise god it probably got a d for it amen but he laid it out anyway praise god amen and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas was with them he made sure he came to church that sunday today because all during the week uh uh they told them on wednesday night are you crazy the lord is risen man praise god and they phoned him up and told him so so finally he made sure he got came in here this morning and he was praising the lord this morning amen praise god amen and with them uh and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas with them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you then said he to thomas or reach hither thy thing he knew what he wanted and behold my hands and reach him with my hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithfulness but believing and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god whenever this happened what he done he got a revelation that jesus was jehovah that's what the lord means and jesus was god that's elohim so he's saying my jehovah and my elohim what a revelation if thomas is here this morning to get this revelation my god jehovah can speak squirrels and things elim can come down to time of life seal you with the seal of faith they can only believe [Music] yes sir jesus said unto him thomas because thou has seen me thou has believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed in revelation 8 1 praise god just to tie it in here uh and when they he had opened that seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour shall we bow our heads in the word of prayer almighty god you come back again on the eighth day and the disciples were within and this time thomas is here and lord we pray god that you do something like he did back then hallelujah to change every thomas in here lord anybody else that don't understand or don't believe praise god may the fire come down today and reveal their names in the book praise god and pour out the holy spirit amen and to those that will see this tape hereafter may the fire fall praise god amen fall out here today lord strengthen my body to finish this message amen praise god amen and i'm looking to be refilled and healed myself while i'm on the battlefield praise god i'm gonna stay on the battlefield hallelujah may these people that they have a faith that they never had before may they sit there and say lord reveal my name lord anoint my faith lord give me some wisdom many do something but not stare at me this morning praise god hallelujah lord god now sweep out over these people here hallelujah praise god deliver them father seal them sanctify them whatever you want to do and anoint me lord hallelujah anoint the ears anoint their heart to receive the word of god this morning anoint the scriptures amen and father we be careful to give you all the praise and all the honor and all the glory in jesus name we pray and ask the blessing amen amen you may be seated so i appreciate your brother singing that song this morning it didn't make a difference amen praise god brother norman i'd like to take a little title then came jesus amen and my subject is the easter seal see a little carryover is the seventh seal mystery of god's finished redemptive work [Music] so i'd like to kind of speak on to these people that don't understand this message here amen my inspiration is the original faith is the resurrection faith amen so now um from last week's sirens this time for the the manifestation of the seven thunders like i said somehow we got sidetracked over to the road to mayors last week i never got into this here and it was quite a time just fighting and defending yourself amen so i just want to finish up today on the seventh angel and his message to the last day brian because the holy spirit is going to fall and you got to know what they got to have the seed to fall on amen and this is the pentecostal age and a lot of new people here and they don't know that so this is the pentecostal age and on the mind events made clear by vindicated prophecy amen uh just to bring it into you and uh page 10 and brother abraham said on page 10 of paragraph 56 we're not living in a pentecostal age we're living in another age see we're not living in a methodist age we're living in another age we're living on up here to the brine age that's what i've been telling you now in the bright age all these years since the prophet left the calling out of the church and getting it together for the rapture so you see what i'm talking about i can't understand the people sloping around do you know you've been called out for the rapture [Applause] people can't come sunday at night they can't pray they can't do nothing amen they call for the rapture praise god people can't worship two nights a month without going to sleep amen you call for the rapture [Music] that's the age that we live in we are now living to my honest opinion that's exactly the truth now friends listen you can be a page 11 and you can be ever so sincere but until we know what we're doing how many know what you're doing here are you in the world are you here or are you going in the rapture or you're in the bride or do you know what you're doing do you know why you're coming here are you just coming to church or do you really want to be in the brain amen babysitter thank you until we know what we're doing you're only fighting at the air come back into the word of god and get lined up and then go then you know like a soldier a soldier don't know what to do until he gets his orders to do it we must be christian soldiers and get orders to do it get orders from the bible for this hour now that's why i was saying the scripture says the scripture says i was giving you orders as one of your commanding officers praise god i was lining up with the word of god fivefold ministry praise god [Applause] may be seated amen we get oils from the bible for this hour now not the charge yesterday the charge the day before but the charge today seven thunders give faint charge come out of the world charge amen kind of low on that one amen praise god amen but the charge today which way we go find out the hour that we're living in [Music] and these modern events they're coming by and it's slipping by us too swiftly don't let the persian gulf war settle you back now and thanks it just it was supposed to bring you up and stay out not it already is over in his past it didn't pass it's here it's a modern event made clear by vindicated prophecy [Music] and i might say this hey i received a phone call from belgium last night brother guido and he was telling me in the dutch newspaper february 2nd said that turkey because the euphrates river comes out of there and it splits and goes into syria and also iraq and that uh it's supposed to be doing it now that's what he said in the dutch paper that turkey is now with a big project building a dam to dam up the euphrates river because they need more water in their damn name for their power then that would dry up the euphrates river [Applause] a little natural sign perhaps amen so maybe the the natural people when they see the river dry maybe they believe [Applause] it's already been spoken and written in the magazine and so forth but the others still don't get it amen maybe they might have to take a flight over there and see it now i believe like thomas until i see the euphrates river dried up and walk in the mud i will not believe it i mean will it be that violent i mean uh praise god maybe seated i believe minds is blown out now huh euphrates river drying i thought that message was back then february somewhere amen see and these mind events are slipping by us too swiftly and one day we're going to find out that we'll be left behind without nothing and be caught sealed into the market of beasts before we know it yes sir but what's the mark of the beast unbelief [Applause] i thought it was a a press to go in your head no it's unbelief when you when you refuse all these mysteries and so forth don't believe in getting the holy ghost and sanctification all these things here you already took the market abuse you're just waiting that's all for the see other words we're waiting for the seven seals to manifest us and those the foolish virgins are waiting for the tribulation period to manifest them one of the other you can't hang in between oh sure brother amen sealed and now now and with patience we have to wait for this uh for the prophecies that's promised see that's what i'm preaching the prophecies every one that must be fulfilled in in its age for it foretells us the author has done has before done this and we will wait to see him do it again what a time it is that we're living in something like a calendar you look at the calendar to find out what uh day of the year you're living in and you look at god's bible to see or what age we're living in now we're not living in the in the methodist age the baptist age we're living in the bright age so i'm bringing it back to you see so you know the calling bringing back to god through a channel that he promised to bring it back in he promised it to it oh i hope malachi 4 has called you out and bring you back in amen now i've been these to these new people have been talking about this messenger praise god on the evening messenger praise god uh page 11 each age has had his message and messenger god has been god has seen to that even in the church ages we find out each one had a messenger each one live the age and another one come in and that one went went out another one come in and on down to the seventh church age that's now each star each angel of the church each messenger and we find out at the last church age over revelation 10 there is to be a trumpet sound and there were seven voices uttered they were not permitted to write but it was sealed on the back of the book the seven seals was on the back side of the book after the book is written then it's sealed back there with seven seals now no one knows what they are but it said in the days of the seventh angel sounding forth his message that's earthly angel now because this angel come down from heaven with the rainbow see and this was on and this one was on earth that's william branham angel is a messenger a messenger to the age so you got two on earth at the same time christ is on the earth through the shout and voice and so forth you get it that's why i don't know why you're dead because he's been here all the time [Applause] he's been investigating you watching your lives watching your attitude when you're not here when you're home or he's been watching you investigating on sunday night services with the video on you've been watching how many are straggling late investigating see if you really want to be sealed up when he drops them dynamics are you ready for the dynamics haven't done everything that you could do you already investigated for 25 years hallelujah now you see what's on this dry time of sitting around maybe seated he's been investigating you amen i've done all that i could do hallelujah he's on the air and then we notice here he had a rainbow over his head and raised up his hand and swore by him to live forever and ever that time should be no more when these seven voices uttered seven thunders uttered their voices and he told them don't write but seal it and we found it was on the back side of the book yes sir but when the seventh angel had finished his message his prophet sign of the day then the mystery of god should be finished everybody knows the bible says that when he would finish them six seals and then he strike that seventh seal then take the seven thumbs from the backside and slide them into the bible the mystery of god should be finished who god is his name his nature all upon him the mystery of the devil and the church should be finished just waiting for them seals to explode then 25 years like ever abraham stagger not praise god through unbelief but strong given praise of god hallelujah not giving in to the spirit to the flesh but pushing on pressing on i'm a seed of god i shall be filled the holy spirit said he shall return unto me according to time of life amen you may be seated but when the seventh angel finishes message is prophesying of the day then the mystery of god should be finished everybody knows the bible says that the mystery of god of what god is who god is and all about the way into the baptism and things that should all be settled in that day should be no more questions then it should be time for them seven thunders [Applause] page 12 and as always always every time a messenger comes it's always to call back to the word see what it is and the people go against the word they get mad amen and they say that in the message the message is to call you back to the bible [Applause] so you can have a bible living church again like [Music] yeah praise god back to the word and nev never fails remember this is a complete revelation of jesus christ there cannot be nothing attitude or taken from it what are you waiting for something to add to what's going on huh what are you waiting for why come in here days week after week and waiting for something else when the holy spirit is already on the earth [Applause] brother nathaniel was sealed and others were sealed [Applause] ain't no special time is when you're ready to be sealed [Applause] when you're dead amen [Music] may be seated nothing attitude taken away from it it is a complete revelation jesus christ and the only way that we can ever be sure if anything rises among us that's contrary to this revelation then it's wrong see it's back to the word and always calling back hallelujah back to the bible amen it's a call back to the word now remember let's remember now this is a complete revelation of jesus christ malachi 4 5-6 and saint luke 17 30 revelation 10 1-7 is the resurrection of the son of man do you understand what i'm saying the son of man that rose on easter the first one came back in the evening time when there shall be light and rose again in 1963 through the seven angels [Applause] that was the resurrection in the end time so you've been in the resurrection you've been in the upper room supposed to have been praising god for 25 years waiting for the dynamics to your mechanics [Applause] so why are they walking out and in and in and out are they in the upper room or what hallelujah praise god may be seated do you understand christ resurrected himself back through william branham but according to the scriptures the scriptures and christ told the two disciples on the road that man is the scriptures you'll get nothing else outside the scriptures you won't get anything else outside of ephesians 4 saint second peter 1 4 7 it'll be the scriptures saint john 14 12 be the scriptures a scriptural bride yay amen so malachi 4 saint luke 17 30 revelation 10 is the resurrection of the son of man in the form of a prophet malachi 4 with a message for a resurrection out of the world and dark denominationalism [Applause] [Music] that's what the message is and when you see the message or hear it that is christ and he says peace be unto you it's finishing the world it's finishing your church you're part of the resurrection you see him then he tells you repentance and remission shall be preached in my name i'll pour out my spirit receive you the holy ghost and why all the sad faces why all the frowning what's wrong where's the joy [Applause] hallelujah glory may be seated and uh you understand what the resurrection is now i come in last sunday it looked like there was no resurrection i was preaching right on the resurrection amen and back to the word again the bible and a promise to the bride of dynamics to her mechanics this message has been living on in books and tapes and in the bride's heart for 28 years that's right the bride has been restored back to the original faith which is the resurrection faith amen the little children's hearts has been turned back by elijah to the hearts of the fathers amen and lay out a seal said they're blind wretched miserable poor and naked and don't know it and look like there wasn't nobody to be saved and lay out a seer but he said don't worry elijah i got 7 000 that didn't bother me to baal i got 7 000 that's hid under the seal of life don't worry elijah i got 7 000 or so that's hid under the seventh seal hallelujah praise god they're hidden under there they're praising god and they're going on praise god [Applause] hallelujah if you take a good look in the spirit you see a cloud but it actually says seventh seal and we're under it praise god [Applause] rejoice [Applause] anything can happen to you now you're in a faith atmosphere where god can reveal glory may be seated the bride has been restored back to the original faith which is the resurrection faith now thomas missed his revelation on easter sunday however eight days later as they gather together again with thomas then came jesus and into their midst again i wonder if he's here this morning is jesus here this morning glory may be seated thomas message was i will not believe and the group revelation was we have seen the lord and we for 17 years have been telling thomas all over the world we have seen the lord praise god amen you got it now we have seen the lord it's funded to us and they said we will not believe it until we see jesus well maybe they will but maybe not in the form that they expect to see them they'll see him according to the scriptures they'll see him according to charity and so forth brotherly kindness signs one is miracles that's how they'll see jesus that's the nail prince praise god in the hands that's it hallelujah [Applause] amen may be seated they entered into amen and then jesus said thomas because thou has seen me thou has believed blessed are they that have not seen and have yet believed they enter into worship jubilee so there are those who could believe just by revelation and they're those who have to wait for the dynamics and the manifestation before they can believe so we understand that so those who don't have to get cursed and reviled all week amen now pentecost it means 50. you understand that it also means jubilee pentecost well say amen are you speaking in the turkish or what am i all right see one part is not sure man see amen [Applause] oh thank you amen see i don't know what you're saying you know write a

that's what i'm here for nothing less hallelujah you can break out of your skins right now you can break into the spirit of the living god hallelujah may be seated then there's coming forth seven mysterious thunders that are not even written at all that's right amen and i believe that 37 thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapture and faith because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it he said it in 1963 and here it is 1991 and they still don't have it the message all over is dead that's how i know the seven times it's got the thunder [Applause] that's how i know it's got to get wrapped in faith that's how i know it's together the people together is to show how to prepare to get out of here it's surprising revival praise god that's how i know it's got to utter it's got to utter after you have learned your abcs hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] glory maybe it's seated the last days to get the brown together for rapturing faith because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it there's something that's got to step forth it says forward here but the word is forth and on the tape got to step forth for we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly we have got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment to be swept up out of the earth and we will find now watch here's a promise and we will find that after a while the lord willing find where it is written [Applause] [Music] now the seven thunders is not written but after a while [Music] 28 years later you'll find where it's written oh god what a revival is going to be my god what a promise fine where's you may be seated i stopped preaching this and nobody believed it amen then all the judgment of these evil doers see now see down through the ages as these seals been breaking until now the last seal is broken i'm reading from your book amen and now as they have been watching in on these seals they've been 28 years watching watching watching new york see what they're doing i'm watching all these evil doers and just presuming what they're doing and these men just presuming out there preaching all kinds of strange things amen and now at the end of the ages of the church ages all of these evil doers will take place and head up in the tribulation hallelujah that bride will be sealed and taken out of here the seven angel messages is to reveal all the mysteries praise god oh hallelujah reveal every one of them yes siree may i take you over to page 146-147 the pentecost is brought in the message of the holy ghost and so forth but in the last days in this last age the messenger is not to start any reformation but does it take all the mystery that those reformers left off and gather them together and solve them out to the people just let me just read it again it sounds so good to me i like to read it i thought another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as the word of sun and his feet as pills of fire now we saw the same thing which was christ and we know christ is always a messenger to the age to the church he is called a pill of fire the angel of the covenant so forth and he had his hand a little book open now the seals have done been broken here we are breaking them now but in this thing in this the thing is open otherwise he's telling in revelation 5 it was closed on the breach but over here now on the first seal he's telling you now we've we're breaking him he was actually breaking the first seal and then when him over top of their heads they know what he's even talking about he was breaking in people beginning to see their names hallelujah see and then then he says revelation 5 the book was closed revelation 10 the book was open wait wait he had an open book and he thundered seven times what opened the book thunders [Applause] and he set his right his right foot upon the sea and left foot upon the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven thunders utter their voices that's all that would come out of his mouth christ opened his mouth and cried and when he cried seven thunders come out of his mouth when he was on the earth [Applause] and then standing there was malachi foreigners with him [Music] glory hallelujah amen and when the seven thousands out of their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not don't write them an angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lift up his hand in heaven and swore by him that lived forever and ever who created heaven out in the things that there are that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer and the prophet says watch don't forget this now as we go but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel that last angel the earthly angel this angel meaning christ come down from heaven it wasn't him he come down from heaven but he's speaking here of the voice of the seventh angel which angel means messenger anybody knows that and a messenger to the church age but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery and watch he says right here he reveals it right here seven seals all the mysteries he says actually says it himself that's why i could say it and they got mad at me for saying it he said it right here seven seals all the mysteries will be revealed in that elijah and the son of man is in that elijah and son of man says here's a new land of promises i promise you a nice land with brooks and little mountains and so forth how are you from

next day uh on the uh brother level told brother brown that some of the people might think is two books the way it was he said it there so brother brown came back the next morning that was thanksgiving night on worx's faith express on page 17 to pick it up so make sure you wouldn't you'd understand it now just like last night speaking when you get the book you're going to see maybe a little confusion there of what i said the the two books of life it's the same book but one of them here get it now was your natural birth uh-huh jon jones born in 1916 whatever it is and born of the mother and father their names and then jon jones all the things that john jones did in life and it brings them right on up here even here today right born in the 1960s or whatever 1970s and how they was in the church and then they went outside and started food around all that deeds that they did that's in the natural book in the message all over all right amen yes sir amen yes sir praise god your natural birth amen like the lord wanted me to come through coleman so he gave me a family name of coleman joseph of coleman that's why i am who i am [Applause] i could have been born uh joseph of levine or somebody amen uh you know genovese or somebody but god been giuseppe genovese amen you understand what i'm saying i'm thinking for a point i'm making a point that's why nobody tells me about me or who i am okay who are you that's the point i'm making i'm not ashamed of who i am i'm joseph of coleman that's a natural book hallelujah care what these people think of the skin the skin it don't mean a thing to me hallelujah praise god amen [Applause] glory praise color the color and all this nonsense here maybe see the praise god i'm so-and-so because i got a little bit straighter here and i got this head shut up forget about it praise god do you have the seed of god in your soul amen praise god [Applause] so you got it huh amen that's the natural book the other one is your spiritual birth when you were born again then your name is transferred hallelujah into the eternal book see the two books now [Applause] maybe seated it's the same book one on your natural birth the other one is your spiritual birth one leads out to the other one now you're gonna type it like the stalk and the wheat of the wheat whenever you talk to me you talk to me as a living person there's a part of me here is that person that must perish that's the book that the name comes off that's the book of life whereas the goats and the foolish virgins and all peoples of the earth will be gathered up there in the book of life the only ones that's not in there is the serpency he didn't record them in there they tried to hide it on the black people but it's not it's right over there in rome it's gotten all the rich and powerful they're the serpent seeds yes sir they can't tell that to me brother yes sir because i know who they are it's a denomination praise god yes sir beautiful people handsome people rich people amen down there running around in florida yes sir hallelujah serpent seeds my god oh you can tell the world about this you can tell the nations about that and what they do is all right everybody covers for them hallelujah the only one that covers with me is the blood of jesus christ that's the only one that i want to cover for me [Applause] glory hallelujah you may be seated i was telling the person the other day here they all shook up but the devil is doing things and so forth i said listen it's just the devil can't do that so what are you talking about so if the blood is covering you he cannot get past the blood so these people going around talking about the throwing spirits on them and conjuring up stuff in the oh ob man and all that kind of stuff that's foolishness because you're under the blood there's not enough demon and voodoo people in haiti or africa anywhere to stop the blood of jesus christ not no demon catholic demons or whatever they are do you hear me praise god oh i'm getting off the subject here praise god talking about something demon did so and so you know demon did anything praise god you may be seated they cannot do anything to you get that out of your head [Applause] maybe seated with two two mafia mafiosis coming in last sunday here we're here late and brother paul mcdowell says and one was real rough looking the other one told brother paul he said father of bless my cross he had a big huge cross called paul father on him to bless his cross paul said no you have to go praise god and one stood like this didn't say a word i guess he had a one of them down in the coat somewhere praise god amen they come they walk right in here last sunday amen so praise god but they can't do anything to you okay how many signs they put up praise god yes siree hallelujah oh my god all right praise god people are afraid of this and afraid of that what are you afraid of praise god it's the same book but one that is your natural birth the other one is your spiritual birth one leads to the other okay they're part of me okay uh that's right that's the book uh uh that the name comes off but the eternal one the predestinated one the elected one the name can never come off from there because it was always on it don't you understand that elohim went a thought and when he thought that christ would die immediately in his mind the blood was splashed [Applause] and he saw you and the blood was splashed in his mind before there was a atom or molecule or whatever there was on the earth before there was an angel god splashed the blood in his mind for you the bride now what demon catholic demon or voodoo demon praise god can do some roots to you and put some little nasty pins and some old dirty raggedy doll or something praise god hallelujah praise god away with that stuff praise god get that stuff out of here praise god amen you may be seated hallelujah amen see where you standing now amen faint amen that's the part of me that's the person that must perish that book the name comes off but the eternal one elected one name can never come off it was always on it can never be taken off you notice it in the book so we save your confusion you'll find that that way because i think brother vale who put the right grammar to it reminding me of it today i said that's right there's only one real book of life like there was one germ of wheat that come through the stalk went through the tassel in the husk into the wheat all the way along there you say now that's the wheat laying there it isn't the wheat it's just dark but together it's the wheat see it's the wheat because it's it's it's all one stalk but the wheat is what you're talking about the grain at the end of it that's what i'm talking about seed time now brian time see past pentecostal shock we're not living there we got in the grain [Music] now the names are called then everybody be saved speak in tongues and do all kinds of thing everybody be saved once that prophet come with that word he only calls the bride and he calls them by name shows them the mystery oh hallelujah praise god [Applause] see it's the wheat because it's the ones thought the wheat is what you're talking about the grain at the end of it the other was a carrier it must perish the lutheran church denominated must perish methodist church denominator must perish pentecostals denominations already perished blind wretched miserable poor naked don't even know it but bride must live because i live you live also praise god i was dead praise god and now i'm alive and you are alive hallelujah and you'll stay alive nothing can happen to you praise god maybe see the praise god amen amen glory to god it must perish and that's the one where one place sound like you can have your name taken off the last book of life and the other place you can't do it so that's what it is it's all in that great revelation there which was made known during the time of the seven seals why is it it was so hard for them people can't believe it why you got it now how many understanding now oh what a wonderful class wonderful you all understand in the book of life anything that had life on this earth except the serpent see was put in a book of life and was recorded [Applause] but down through the seven church ages there was some elected seeds hid in the seals [Applause] and the messengers of each age that was hid in the seals had a message not fully revealed they caught the mystery not fully revealed and blasted it out there and those who came to it they saw their names and it comes right on down to the last age when everything is finished hallelujah there's nothing left but malachi 4 said hold on hold on i'll send you elijah praise god before the end time may be seated praise god oh hallelujah do you get it now so though you in a book of life your natural life all your deeds everything that was done when you came to this message and received the holy ghost your name was transferred into the blood section the eternal section there's nothing against you and around here cursing me for seven thunders i'm in the blood section there's nothing against me [Applause] i don't know why they're even bothering and these sisters go around here speaking against me and say i preached too hard and blah blah blah there's nothing against me sister he told me to say it that way [Music] yay so you're the one that's wrong praise god what the word of god will come out of you woman you're wrong amen you may be seated praise god you don't know the bible hallelujah now you got that from your natural you got natural christians can't hardly praise god they're in the book of life they're in the message they're natural amen but if the name was ever put in the blood section with the holy ghost easter seal or praise god forget it a spiritual bath the blood section the name can never be erased off eradicated eliminated [Applause] can never be you always was you are eternity do you understand that when god existed you existed my god huh you're part of god well maybe that'll come in on you may be seated and that being part of god was your preparation [Applause] see god knew that you got to have that was the good ground he knew the son of man would sow the seeds for 25 years message and the wayside and stony and thorny but they had some good ground prepared ground that was part of his mind and they're the ones that would see their names and they'll stagger now they're not going to back off [Applause] [Music] do you see it see how he does it god god can't fail oh if you don't want to worship that's not going to change god if you don't want to come sunday night that will not change god [Applause] will not do it amen here's how you did it amen praise god page 18 you notice no man can come except my father draws them first and all the fathers give me they will come they'll recognize it no other man can do it no other person or no matter how good who you are it's got to be revealed to you then you see who jesus christ is and that's your name and here's how he prepares you now here predestinated plan is in plain view just as others seek the word of god as a seed and must have the ground prepared beforehand if you sold seed just throw it out there on the ground it would do no good the berries would pick it up you throw it among thistles and thorns it'll choke it out pretty soon jesus parable said so so the ground has to be made ready first so god in solving grace prepares the heart first he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age and him is the seven seals in all the mysteries he prepared your heart to receive that seed [Applause] [Music] yes hallelujah to receive him in this age he foreknew you by his foreknowledge and ordained you to eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared you and that's who i'm preaching to praise god and that's the reason you staggered out of these things and staggered into what you have now it was god leading you to the place where he had ordained for you to be he ordained you to be in new york city prayer scott no matter how rough and rocky it is praise god hallelujah he put you there amen and you shall be filled and you shall be sealed then king jesus hallelujah praise god if this ground isn't prepared beforehand you may be seated it can't grow that's the reason the seed of faith when you're preaching faith see the discernments of the lord and see what takes place and all the gifts of the bible working and people working and and say oh hallelujah i believe it and come up and find themselves disappointed see the ground has to be foreign and you know and you know when it strikes it [Applause] all unbelief see the ground has got to be prepared hallelujah take courage preachers oh you got it now so i'm preaching to what to prepare the ground i don't expect the others this book of life what can i do amen they ain't seen their names yet they have been transferred over to the eternal section by the baptism of the holy ghost and fire so that's what it is it's all in that great revelation there which was made known during the time of the seven seals preparedness see so when you see and then when you do you understand it it's a jubilee it's joy it's a revelation that causes stimulation by the revelation and it goes on and on and on because the bible said abraham staggered out for 25 years as strong as it went off praise god because it's a finished work once you have been sealed by the east to seal which is the seventh seal mystery of god's finished redemptive work amen yes sir now remember that revelation 8 1 said and they opened it seven seals there's nothing but the space of a half an hour they didn't know what was was there nobody knew was nothing there at all no preacher no uh ddd phd they didn't know what because there was anything written there the other was symbols nothing here at all amen so there's a revealing time number two and there's a claiming time let's get ready for the claiming time glory yes all sir let me quickly hurry here my i gotta hold on in here didn't expect to get all this in here yes sir let me uh dress it down yes sir almost finished it yes sir so that's a miracle amen okay page 111 a breach amen we talk about revealing time now what a jubilee going in heaven when the lamb leaves that intercessory box to come here to possess his claims you know that that guy next to john he must have seen his name written there yes sir when those seals broke he must have got real happy did you get real happy when you heard them uh huh [Applause] listen to what it listens to his testimony and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all is that they are in them then heard our saying blessing and honor and glory and power unto him that let us sit upon the throne into the land forever and ever amen amen amen see what see what happens to you when your name is revealed then my god and the four beasts that amen in the days say amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him and living forever and ever amen glory talk about a jubilee talk about a time when that lamb walked forth see that book's even sealed in heaven the message i'll say is my name there i don't know i hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of the world see it's tying in now praise god hallelujah but but the first thing that represented that redemption come the land that had been slain from the foundation of the world and he took the book glory opened the book and tore off the seals and sent it she sent the revelation down to the prophet the the redemption down there oh yes sir the redemption rights shoot my god send it down to the earth to the seventh angel to reveal it to his people they are oh my what happened to screams the shout the hallelujahs the glories of god and old

everything in heaven he must have really crying out didn't he everything in heaven everything on earth everything beneath the earth every creature everything else heard me saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and power and might and riches belong to him amen now watch why why when the revelation come that the lamb the redeemer of kinsmen had come back from the throne of mediator and walked
