[14:36] Love to take what they had nothing
[14:38] against it of literature and whatever
[14:40] more into the different parts of the
[14:42] world now the church denomination had
[14:45] gone back to Education Works again see
[14:48] going back and that's what he ends up in
[14:50] lay out of sea works
[14:52] again after the great denomination had
[14:55] been set up Jesus set an Open Door see
[14:59] it there after the westlan age it
[15:02] already was a Methodist Church and he

[15:18] and after the wesan age had come in and
[15:21] the Methodist Church had been
[15:23] establishing the Earth taking Roots
[15:26] growing making a great church which it
[15:28] is today one of the greatest among the
[15:30] Protestant churches and that time the
[15:33] thing that took place then was Jesus set
[15:37] an open door to the church before before
[15:43] they entered into the leoan
[15:46] age praise God Amen cuz the word was
[15:50] already written that the leoan was going
[15:53] to be blind wretched miserable pooring

[16:28] an Open Door door oh no it's all right
[16:32] how the Lord said the end of that age I
[16:35] am the door to the Sheepfold now what
[16:37] door was open about Jesus just between
[16:40] these two ages
[16:42] 1906 about when the Methodist and Dwight
[16:46] Moody and them faded from the scene Here
[16:48] Come A Break Forth of the people
[16:50] receiving the Holy Ghost on Aza Street
[16:52] uh speaking with tongues and and and uh
[16:54] things back into the church that was
[16:57] that was right in about 19 1906 and and
[17:00] it came to New York City in 1909 by by
[17:03] Brother Brown from Glad Tidings church
[17:06] see this is church history right here in
[17:08] New York City and then Bishop Lawson he
[17:11] came from Ohio about 1919 with the
[17:13] baptism the name of the Lord Jesus
[17:15] Christ see he had an open door but he
[17:18] did nominated too see but Brown they had
[17:20] Father Son and Holy Ghost that's why all
[17:22] your trinitarian Pentecostal come from
[17:24] glad Titan's
[17:25] Church see praise God and they branched
[17:28] out and this one and that one then of
[17:30] course the the Assemblies of God brother
[17:32] Brown was here before the Assemblies of
[17:34] God got started cuz it was called the
[17:36] general Council in 1912 and 15 before
[17:39] they even got started brother Brown was
[17:40] on Glad Tidings independent you see me
[17:43] now so anyway uh amen it's good for you
[17:46] know your church history praise God and
[17:49] a Break Forth of the people receiving
[17:51] the Holy Ghost all right what took place
[17:53] then begin to come along the first thing
[17:54] you know they organized the old General
[17:57] Council which went in now called the
[18:00] Assemblies of God see how of that church
[18:03] was laed over and what what taking place
[18:06] then he said an open door now let's read
[18:09] it no man shut it set before thee open
[18:11] door I Know Thy works I have set before
[18:14] thee an open door and no man can shut it
[18:16] an Open Door what is it it was the
[18:19] revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus
[18:23] Christ not being a second person of a
[18:26] trinity but God but being God himself
[18:30] made flesh and dwelling Among Us and the
[18:34] Revelation amen he said now the first
[18:37] time the name has been spoke of now
[18:40] since back in this age back here it lost
[18:43] his name that was Luther now because uh
[18:46] Paul and arenius and Martin Columba had
[18:48] the same doctrine that they had on the
[18:49] day of Pentecost the baptism in the name
[18:51] of Jesus Christ but they went in the
[18:53] ground in columia and Rome took over and
[18:55] income father Son and Holy Ghost and
[18:58] Luther brought it out on you thou H has
[19:00] a name and thou art dead father Son and
[19:03] Holy Ghost and they're still dead praise
[19:06] God cuz those are Idols praise God
[19:11] amen amen I'm a father I'm a son and and

[19:16] husband and I have a name Joseph Coleman
[19:19] praise God he's the Holy Ghost he's the
[19:23] father he's the son but he has a name
[19:25] Jesus Christ
[19:30] God
[19:32] Amen may be seated first time the name
[19:35] been spoken of since now way back in
[19:37] this age here lost his name and Luther
[19:39] come out with a name that he was alive
[19:42] and it was dead that's right father son
[19:44] the Holy Ghost here comes out the name
[19:47] of Jesus again in
[19:49] between these two ages here in between
[19:52] the open door now it's a revelation what
[19:55] he or what he was the deity the
[19:59] Revelations of his
[20:01] deity see that's why it's hard to
[20:03] understand somebody say they have the
[20:04] Holy Ghost and don't know who he is so
[20:07] how can he's Assembly of God and all
[20:08] these people have the Holy Ghost when
[20:09] they don't even know who he
[20:12] is they got three Gods how can I know
[20:15] which one is
[20:16] right oh praise God God be
[20:20] praised now you see why this is very
[20:22] important here now I don't want to take
[20:24] too much time on it cuz I have to take
[20:25] you to the into the ground and and kill
[20:28] you
[20:29] I mean I don't want to say it like that
[20:30] because brother Wesco said we need a
[20:32] killing and the security up there to
[20:34] come running out there with their hands
[20:36] on their guns looking for the killing
[20:37] you know brother that was 1985 and Tulsa
[20:40] amen praise God now that's what he
[20:43] revealed at the very first church age
[20:45] now watch as John saw him standing the
[20:48] seven golden candlesticks there they are
[20:50] right there get a picture he was
[20:53] standing standing in between them he was
[20:55] standing with his hands out and just
[20:58] just look at the cand up there here's
[20:59] the first Candlestick 2 3D fourth 5ifth
[21:01] 6th and seventh with his hands out in
[21:03] the form of a cross he said I am Alpha
[21:06] and Omega in other words I'll be Supreme
[21:09] in the first which is Alpha and I'll be
[21:11] Supreme in the last which is
[21:14] now oh praise
[21:17] God Amen the light rises in the East and
[21:21] sets in the west it's been a dismal dark
[21:23] time but it shall be light in the
[21:25] evening time the same Gospel Power that
[21:28] raised up here on on the one hand at the
[21:30] East has shine over and now in the other
[21:33] hand at the West Alpha and Omega I am a

[21:48] right well now notice excuse me every
[21:52] one of these churches coming down

[22:17] his flesh and he was sitting on the
[22:19] throne and anas and saf fire lied that
[22:23] was him then when it struck Paul's age

[41:43] into the tribulation just in a few
[41:45] minutes we'll see it goes into the
[41:46] tribulation and the tribulation did not
[41:49] come in the days of Wesley so what age
[41:52] are we in what's this door set before is
[41:56] between the Wesley where the church is
[41:59] headed right now and already into the
[42:02] lean age but this little place right in
[42:05] here within the last 35 40 years now
[42:08] he's speaking about this is a few years
[42:09] ago 1960 or so he talking about the
[42:12] little door there see uh within the last
[42:14] 35 40 years there been an open door
[42:17] setting right before the people to come
[42:19] in and God will take the remnant and
[42:21] seal it off and they'll go they go on
[42:25] until lukewarm just spurt them out of
[42:27] his mouth the work will be cut short up
[42:31] goes the church and here goes the
[42:33] Antichrist moving in for Destruction you
[42:36] know Revelation 12 tells you he goes
[42:38] after they who keep the Commandments and
[42:41] the other group the ones that he missed
[42:43] see he goes after them with a Vengeance
[42:46] amen he goes after the church and the
[42:49] Jews just perfect fits with the whole
[42:52] Bible right on around all right now
[42:55] here's the appearing of the sleeping
[42:56] Virgin also so she comes right in here
[42:58] now there's millions of them in this
[43:00] message I'm not in the message all
[43:02] around the world and proves that the
[43:03] lasts of the church ages move to the
[43:05] first part of the Pentecost for they go
[43:07] on into the Great Tribulation where they
[43:09] shall come in which did not come in the
[43:11] westly age you better get wisdom
[43:13] Revelation to missst that door oh my
[43:16] that was a quite a while there praise
[43:18] God well there you are
[43:20] Church did you get it catch that door
[43:24] and there's a
[43:25] door amen you know what the open door is
[43:27] now it's between Leia and also Wesley
[43:32] it's a door open there of the Supreme
[43:34] deity it's a door of Revelation and it
[43:37] goes right on up through there see and
[43:39] it's a I put a red line it goes right on
[43:42] through there brother Brandon was right
[43:43] in there himself and he went on and his
[43:45] message is what he brought in Statue of
[43:47] a perfect man and he put Holy Ghost
[43:49] there Holy Spirit and that is our
[43:54] age and we'll be stones that will be we
[43:57] are being called out by the prophet's
[43:59] word I'll speak on it maybe next week
[44:01] amen well praise
[44:04] God
[44:06] Amen now let's nail it down question
[44:10] answers on the Seven Seals page
[44:12] 464 um he brings back about the lion and
[44:17] the uh the The Lion and the ox and the
[44:21] man he's speaking about the man here
[44:23] which was Luther and Wesley and of
[44:24] course the eagle is the prophet he say
[44:27] okay now after the death of Wesley they
[44:29] had a Methodist organization see and now
[44:32] I want you to notice now someone might
[44:35] asked about the Pentecostal which was
[44:37] the third age you see each one of those
[44:39] ages only taking a dip into the Holy
[44:43] Spirit justification is a work of the
[44:45] Holy Spirit sanctification is a work of
[44:47] the Holy Spirit but now watch listen
[44:49] very carefully but the baptism is the
[44:51] holy spirit now watch you see and that's
[44:54] the reason it took a prophetic prophet
[44:57] not William Brandon so he speaking here
[44:59] took a prophetic Prophet to come down no
[45:03] Messenger to the age that's in between
[45:07] because the Holy Ghost came
[45:10] himself in his fullness in the
[45:14] baptism the fire come to burn the demons
[45:18] out in
[45:19] 1906 and the open door age the fire

[45:25] then as you yet speak these words fire
[45:28] falls from heaven and burn every devil
[45:30] out of you praise God and you receive
[45:32] the Holy Ghost and then he comes into
[45:35] you in the open door in babe form and
[45:38] I'm going to prove it see it's a babe
[45:40] and it goes through all these years as a
[45:42] babe and if you should die you go to
[45:45] heaven and there's another house waiting

[45:59] green and then we have to be here for a
[46:01] purpose to pull this gospel yes
[46:05] sir Malachi's words shall not fall to
[46:07] the ground in vain they shall be
[46:11] lived yes sir did you get it
[46:15] now uh no Messenger to the age in
[46:18] between see because it wouldn't work out
[46:20] right then then William Brandon you
[46:22] would have him down at the end of
[46:24] Wesley look at it so you had to put
[46:28] Elijah at the end of Wesley cuz they
[46:30] come at the end so the Holy Spirit uh
[46:33] fixed him up and came himself and Open
[46:39] Door see and he knew that that was the
[46:42] the third one Luther Wesley Open Door
[46:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost he knew at the
[46:46] end would come the person of Jesus
[46:49] Christ
[46:57] praise
[46:59] God my my my my I believe you're
[47:03] understanding the
[47:04] word
[47:05] amen the word open the word open up to
[47:08] you all right holy ghost himself in his
[47:12] fullness in the
[47:13] baptism other words everything is going
[47:15] to be in that
[47:16] baptism amen it's the word cuz he knows
[47:20] that he going to send a profet and pour
[47:21] seeds in

[47:25] man yes sir but at the end of the age as
[47:29] it always uh Enders upon the others we
[47:32] find there then the messenger sent and
[47:35] all these Scruples and things are to be
[47:37] placed in their places like that then
[47:40] the Rapture comes to the
[47:41] church there you are so you understand
[47:44] the open door age now all right then we
[47:47] can go on huh and this in this seed time
[47:50] prad time you know where you come from
[47:52] you know where you
[47:54] going okay I believe that was the
[47:56] message to cut off off the intellectuals
[47:57] head knowledge and give you a revelation
[47:59] of your seed and your time and season
[48:03] that you might be ready for the true
[48:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost and a

[48:19] lot of people don't understand it so I
[48:21] have get a real short quote here so you
[48:23] understand it question answers uh number
[48:26] four it's in your Cod book amen question
[48:30] 129e have the seven thund which equals
[48:32] seven Mysteries already been revealed
[48:35] question were they revealed in the Seven
[48:37] Seals but uh are yet not known to us as
[48:41] the Thunders yet no they were revealed
[48:45] in the Seven Seals that's why I told you
[48:47] he took them from the back and put them
[48:49] under the seventh so they so it could be
[48:51] could be revealed in the
[48:54] book otherwise it be stuck to the back
[48:56] and you see no they weren't revealed in
[48:59] the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders
[49:01] was about they was to
[49:07] reveal the Thunders come to reveal the
[49:10] inside of the
[49:12] book then the Thunders preached the
[49:15] seeds from the book The revealed
[49:20] word here it

[49:50] Thunders that had uttered their voices
[49:52] and no one could make out what it was
[49:54] John knew what it was now how come John
[49:57] represents the church he knew what the
[49:58] Thunders was but he did not know what
[50:00] the seven written seals
[50:02] was why is that well he's the type of
[50:05] the church that will know what the
[50:06] Thunders
[50:08] are that's right see but a prophet had
[50:10] to come uh end time mess those seven
[50:13] written seals was his
[50:15] message that those seals Vindicated him
[50:17] before he went
[50:19] out so he opened the Sixth Seal mystery

[1:03:05] word and when that fullness you see
[1:03:07] there's unusual things begin to happen
[1:03:09] that he promised that's the reason our
[1:03:11] great social lives and things can't
[1:03:13] understand that is foolishness to them
[1:03:15] now watch they're forming a council of
[1:03:17] churches see just the time when the
[1:03:20] church is beginning to get to his feet
[1:03:24] where the supernatural is begin to work
[1:03:28] now they all went into a group and now
[1:03:30] they're going to try to stop this stuff
[1:03:33] just exactly like it was
[1:03:35] then that's why I was preaching one of
[1:03:38] the messages there when uh Peter when
[1:03:40] they were preaching salvation nothing
[1:03:42] happened but when they healed the lame
[1:03:44] man oh my God all Jerusalem was turned
[1:03:47] upside down see God has the season for
[1:03:50] that to start he wants you to get a
[1:03:52] revelation
[1:03:53] first what good would would for head for
[1:03:56] the dead to raising hand cripples or
[1:03:58] blind see when you don't even have
[1:03:59] Revelation that you're going to
[1:04:02] heaven does he make sense you come all
[1:04:05] these years and see the see all the
[1:04:07] Dynamics and don't have don't even have
[1:04:09] the Holy Ghost
[1:04:10] yet and there you see see get the best
[1:04:14] thing
[1:04:16] first okay see forming seed time form
[1:04:19] seed forming time is now forming means
[1:04:22] when you're dying and Christ is coming
[1:04:24] to life in you amen but this is coming
[1:04:26] the last days when the completeness see
[1:04:29] okay and um this could not happen in the
[1:04:33] age of Luther Wesley Pentecostals only
[1:04:35] in Joseph
[1:04:36] Perfection now you said only in Joseph
[1:04:38] Perfection sure uh well I thought um uh
[1:04:42] the Pentecost had the baptism of the
[1:04:43] Holy Ghost that's right but see
[1:04:45] something El there was a mystery laying
[1:04:46] there page 246 and question answer book
[1:04:49] number
[1:04:50] four uh question uh 136 if the natural
[1:04:54] birth requires water blood and spirit
[1:04:56] does not the spiritual birth require all
[1:04:58] three stages of grace before the person
[1:05:01] is truly Born Again absolutely I just
[1:05:03] explained it this morning the same on
[1:05:05] the same thing you got to have all
[1:05:08] stages uh you are begotten of the spirit
[1:05:11] just like a baby is begotten into the
[1:05:12] womb that's when the egg and the sperm
[1:05:15] come together and the mother is begotten
[1:05:18] then you get it now that's when the
[1:05:20] backbone lungs everything begin to form
[1:05:22] in the feet and it's begotten and the
[1:05:24] flesh begin to come on it it's begotten
[1:05:26] and it's eating is jumping punching
[1:05:28] moving aive begotten baby in the
[1:05:33] womb but it's not the life outside the
[1:05:36] womb so a Sanctified baby in the womb is
[1:05:39] not the same as a baptized Born Again
[1:05:42] praise God it's not the
[1:05:45] same praise
[1:05:48] God Amen hope that drove it home you're
[1:05:52] not the same and if you're not then hit
[1:05:55] you your knees praise God and beg God
[1:05:57] for the Holy
[1:05:58] Ghost I must be sealed I must be sealed
[1:06:02] and stop sitting around here and just
[1:06:03] hearing hearing hearing hearing hearing
[1:06:06] do something
[1:06:08] else
[1:06:09] yeah may be seated you're begotten in
[1:06:12] the spirit just like a baby is begotten
[1:06:14] in the womb of a mother but not born
[1:06:16] until they receive the Holy Ghost that's
[1:06:18] right you're born then you're not
[1:06:20] converted you are in the procession of
[1:06:23] being converted until that time so while
[1:06:26] you're in the mother's womb you're in a
[1:06:27] procession of getting ready to come out
[1:06:29] and then the doctor bang and screams out
[1:06:33] yes sir now watch here's a revelation
[1:06:37] reveal I've doubt very very few that
[1:06:39] many menes even understand it that's the
[1:06:42] reason that all these great Mysteries
[1:06:45] could not be given to Luther could not
[1:06:49] be given to Wesley now watch could not
[1:06:52] be given to the age that has just passed
[1:06:55] by us
[1:06:56] the pente Pentecostal age why it wasn't
[1:07:00] time they were
[1:07:04] begotten now wait a minute how could the
[1:07:06] Pentecostal be begotten well look on
[1:07:08] that uh chart there
[1:07:11] Faith look at Faith there in Paul's age
[1:07:14] and and think about brother Brown statue
[1:07:16] of a perfect man he said oh you got
[1:07:18] faith oh great big wave came over you he
[1:07:21] said you just got
[1:07:23] started you born again
[1:07:26] Faith you just got started you only
[1:07:28] begotten in my
[1:07:30] age in the prophet's age you begotten
[1:07:33] with your Holy
[1:07:34] Ghost cuz he brought another
[1:07:38] message he brought the person that's
[1:07:41] added up right
[1:07:42] there as long as he didn't come that's
[1:07:44] why they didn't want to hear him long as
[1:07:46] he didn't come they could speak in
[1:07:47] tongues they were
[1:07:49] fine but when he come no no no he told
[1:07:53] women to stop cutting their hair on back
[1:07:55] to the the
[1:07:57] Bible Acts 238 they didn't want to hear
[1:08:00] it see do you see
[1:08:04] it they will only beg gotten this
[1:08:08] message here made the Pentecostals be
[1:08:11] [Music]
[1:08:13] gotten unless he had preached it don't
[1:08:16] mean nothing but when he preached that
[1:08:18] forget it they were
[1:08:20] begotten yes sir
[1:08:23] Glory that's why I told you that you got
[1:08:26] it in 83 well you ain't moved an
[1:08:29] inch how could you move an inch until
[1:08:31] Joseph Perfection
[1:08:33] [Applause]
[1:08:34] [Music]
[1:08:36] come you may be seated
[1:08:40] Glory see another Revelation to you they
[1:08:44] were
[1:08:45] begotten now the person of Christ
[1:08:48] himself the son of man you understand
[1:08:52] revealing himself in human flesh it
[1:08:54] could not have have come till
[1:08:57] now there you are Church oh praise
[1:09:02] God yes sir begotten and born amen but
[1:09:06] now notice the great revelation of the
[1:09:08] Mysteries here see and the Mysteries
[1:09:10] could not come to like I said one of the
[1:09:12] great Mysteries revealed in Malachi 4
[1:09:14] was that the Pentecostals were babies
[1:09:16] with gifts to play with instead of the
[1:09:18] person he gave them gifts and not the
[1:09:22] person and they remained spiritual
[1:09:24] bathed
[1:09:26] drinking the S milk of the
[1:09:30] word grow up and even in Hebrews find
[1:09:32] about what you still baby I'm surprised
[1:09:34] you're not teachers yet huh is where
[1:09:38] aren't your teachers huh amen the stayed
[1:09:41] babies Pentecostal babies with gifts to
[1:09:44] play with and were truly only begotten
[1:09:47] even though they were actually born
[1:09:50] again cuz that this proves it right here
[1:09:53] why it wasn't time they were begotten
[1:09:55] now now the person of Christ himself the
[1:09:57] son of man you understand revealing
[1:09:59] himself in human flesh it uh uh it could
[1:10:02] not have come to this time and brother B
[1:10:05] himself said on service what is the time
[1:10:06] he said the mystery of the person of
[1:10:08] Jesus Christ being in you without
[1:10:12] Sensations and he revealed that mystery
[1:10:14] in the in the 40s and 50s the person of
[1:10:17] Christ in him it's one thing we can say
[1:10:20] we know he got love but we don't know
[1:10:21] about his
[1:10:23] Doctrine amen so he revealed charity
[1:10:25] the person well praise God then that
[1:10:29] that canceled out
[1:10:31] Jacob praise God canceled out but it had
[1:10:34] to come on to a certain
[1:10:36] time maybe some brothers had to pick up
[1:10:38] the
[1:10:40] inspiration praise God and preach it
[1:10:43] Against All Odds Against what everybody
[1:10:45] got to say about it because it was to he
[1:10:49] it wasn't to them

[1:11:54] green time
[1:11:55] Corner wheat time and the corner wheat
[1:11:59] uh uh uh the corner wheat uh wait a
[1:12:01] minute I got something here I can moan
[1:12:03] right in here and the corn of wheat can
[1:12:06] uh uh oh okay I got it I didn't dot my
[1:12:09] eye carries a law with it to be
[1:12:12] productive and fruitful that's right
[1:12:15] what is the law well I just read it to
[1:12:17] you verily verily I say unto
[1:12:19] you you have Seven Seals seven Thunder
[1:12:22] that's a corn of weed but it carries a
[1:12:24] law
[1:12:26] oh so where you going with the message
[1:12:29] huh back to the Bible to the
[1:12:33] law there's a law of that corn of
[1:12:37] wheat oh very very I say to you except
[1:12:40] the corn of wheat fall on the ground and
[1:12:41] die it abideth alone you have all your
[1:12:43] books and your tapes and you march on to
[1:12:45] the tribulation period but if it die it
[1:12:48] bringeth forth much fruit there's your
[1:12:51] law for this season from God's
[1:12:54] word praise God three
[1:12:57] questions number one to whom do you go
[1:13:01] to in order to
[1:13:02] die and how do you
[1:13:05] die you like this question see amen see
[1:13:10] how do you know when you are
[1:13:17] dead how do you know do you ring a bell
[1:13:19] or something or what dingling dingling
[1:13:22] you're dead how do you know amen
[1:13:26] how do you know when you are
[1:13:28] alive how do you know those are three
[1:13:30] questions well sir we would see Jesus
[1:13:34] volume 3 number 23 okay here we go we'll
[1:13:38] go along here a little bit
[1:13:39] amen all right and usually and notice
[1:13:42] usually the way that people want to find
[1:13:44] Jesus is to find this page 11 is to find
[1:13:47] somebody who knows how to take them to
[1:13:49] him a leader or one of his servants is
[1:13:52] the way they find them so Jesus if he
[1:13:55] ever chooses a servant he always chooses
[1:13:58] somebody that will bring the people to
[1:14:00] him because it's his purpose to Serve
[1:14:02] the People well Hallelujah you don't
[1:14:06] understand brother come you see I said
[1:14:08] but the word says but see you don't
[1:14:09] understand now I'm taking you to Jesus
[1:14:12] you come in at a room I take you to
[1:14:13] Jesus but I had a dream and I had to say
[1:14:16] I don't care what you had that's what
[1:14:18] the word
[1:14:19] says you coming to
[1:14:23] Jesus okay question number one to whom
[1:14:25] do you go to in order to die and how do
[1:14:27] you die so if Jesus ever chooses a
[1:14:29] servant he always chooses somebody that
[1:14:31] will bring the people to him because
[1:14:33] it's his purpose to serve his
[1:14:37] people you're not serving me you're
[1:14:39] serving him and then he serves you just
[1:14:42] sends the Holy Spirit down and seals you
[1:14:44] and heals you he want to serve
[1:14:46] you don't look Comm man look to the
[1:14:53] Lord there is the answer to question one
[1:14:56] in part page 12 amen now um now here's a
[1:15:01] great thing in text here uh just as soon
[1:15:05] as the Greeks were was pointing to Jesus
[1:15:07] Jesus did not point to himself or he did
[1:15:10] not make himself known to them see that
[1:15:12] there and neither can we we we have this
[1:15:14] the the the corn of wheat that's why get
[1:15:16] tie in these meetings they're trying to
[1:15:18] know through what we was preaching for
[1:15:20] 11 all these years and Pen Harris and so
[1:15:22] forth the holy spirit said enough of the
[1:15:24] make of mechanics they have to
[1:15:28] die amen I brought every every kind of
[1:15:31] Revelation all the brothers did is that
[1:15:34] correct and the reading said
[1:15:36] finish they got a die I send the token
[1:15:39] down here's the anointing they tasted it
[1:15:42] now let them
[1:15:45] die well praise God
[1:15:48] Amen oh praise God Amen so
[1:15:52] uh Jesus didn't point to himself or did
[1:15:55] not uh neither Malachi point to himself
[1:15:57] he pointed to the word or did he make
[1:15:59] himself known to them because you cannot
[1:16:01] know Jesus that in that way Jesus isn't
[1:16:03] known in that way you see now that would
[1:16:06] be more like in the 1961 version of it
[1:16:09] see but this 61 book here but look as
[1:16:12] soon as they were brought into his
[1:16:14] presence there it is that's the main
[1:16:17] thing get the people in his
[1:16:20] presence that's what we had had
[1:16:22] endeavored to do in thec by preaching
[1:16:24] the re revelation of Malachi for's
[1:16:26] message which brings down the presence
[1:16:28] get the people in the
[1:16:30] presence and that's all what we' have
[1:16:32] done can we say Amen is a presence here

[1:47:01] pains by Malachi for yeah from the day
[1:47:05] on but I got the Holy Ghost I know yeah
[1:47:07] but uh see this message here you know
[1:47:10] that makes you
[1:47:12] begotten and you don't have the Holy
[1:47:14] Ghost yet cuz at the
[1:47:16] time amen you down there a babe down in
[1:47:18] in faith amen and you want some virtue

[1:47:26] virtues praise
[1:47:28] God oh Hallelujah quickly uh okay
[1:47:32] there's your seven birth P by Malachi 4
[1:47:34] and then the love of God seals you up
[1:47:35] for service and you're plac Vindicated
[1:47:37] and adopted in over the death of a corn
[1:47:39] and wheat it takes pain to bring forth
[1:47:42] birth it takes dying and one has to
[1:47:45] cease so the other one can
[1:47:49] exist praise God this flesh Must Die
[1:47:53] that the spirit might
[1:47:55] live yes sir there's a
[1:47:58] spirit page eight amen three stages of
[1:48:02] birth well you know what it is like the
[1:48:04] natural and spiritual the water just
[1:48:06] sanctification justification by faith
[1:48:08] believing on God receiving as your
[1:48:09] personal savior being baptized second
[1:48:11] the sanctification of the spirit that
[1:48:13] God cleanses the spirit from all the
[1:48:14] elements of the world and the desire of
[1:48:17] the world and then the Holy Spirit comes
[1:48:19] in and gives New Birth and fills up that
[1:48:21] Sanctified vessel there we are page nine
[1:48:25] so notice in the seed's birth the old
[1:48:27] seed must die before the new one can be
[1:48:32] born amen so therefore death is hard
[1:48:38] anytime so it's painful
[1:48:41] distressful birth is the same because
[1:48:44] you're bringing life into the world and
[1:48:46] it's
[1:48:48] painful amen can we say Amen am
[1:48:53] okay you got to die so and then after
[1:48:55] you're born again then you have to
[1:48:57] really die to yourself like Galatians
[1:49:00] 2:20 I'm crucified with Christ
[1:49:02] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[1:49:05] liveth in me and in the Life which I now
[1:49:08] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[1:49:12] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[1:49:14] himself for me and many as left by the
[1:49:17] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:49:19] the death of a corn of weat okay page 10
[1:49:22] Jesus said that he was the word that the
[1:49:24] his word was a seed that a SE went forth
[1:49:27] to seow now we're all acquainted with
[1:49:29] that and I want to teach you like a son
[1:49:30] school lesson here is Sunday that's what
[1:49:32] I'm doing today notice this then this
[1:49:35] word being a seed but remember the seed
[1:49:38] is only bringing forth a new life when
[1:49:40] it
[1:49:42] dies amen and that's the reason it was
[1:49:45] so hard for those Pharisees to
[1:49:48] understand our Lord Jesus Christ because
[1:49:50] they were under the law now remember you
[1:49:52] two cannot coexist together they were
[1:49:54] under the law and the law was the word
[1:49:57] of God In seed form but when the word
[1:50:01] was made flesh that's what I'm trying to
[1:50:03] get
[1:50:05] to here the word is made flesh in you
[1:50:09] [Applause]
[1:50:11] today and you can't coexist with all
[1:50:13] little nasty things of Jacob
[1:50:16] Grace it can't be no more that
[1:50:19] dies
[1:50:20] Hallelujah yes sir
[1:50:23] my God the word the law was in seed form
[1:50:27] but when the word was made flesh become
[1:50:29] not law but Grace and now becomes
[1:50:33] Perfection is a
[1:50:36] reflection amen now Grace and law cannot
[1:50:39] exist at the same time because Grace is
[1:50:41] so far above the law law is not even in
[1:50:43] the picture and therefore it's so hard
[1:50:47] for the Pharisees to die to their law so
[1:50:50] that Grace could be born amen but it
[1:50:52] must go the two laws cannot exist at the
[1:50:55] same
[1:50:57] time well you got one law of the flesh
[1:51:01] Romans 7 and you got one law of the
[1:51:04] spirit now what are you going to
[1:51:05] do when I would I would not I know I
[1:51:08] ain't going to even get into you read
[1:51:09] the Bible amen praise God I ain't going
[1:51:12] over there but there's a law to your
[1:51:14] flesh and to your as a law to the spirit
[1:51:16] and you ain't going have the other
[1:51:18] unless that flesh that Lord
[1:51:20] dies yes sir so there we are praise God
[1:51:25] it's hard for the people in the message
[1:51:26] to die to their thoughts about the
[1:51:29] message and receive a revelation Jose of
[1:51:30] perfection that Christ can be molded and
[1:51:33] formed in them for Perfection they don't
[1:51:35] want to hear it amen I know it I've been
[1:51:37] through it brother amen okay page 13 now
[1:51:41] we know the old seed must before the new
[1:51:45] seed can come out of the old seed it
[1:51:48] must
[1:51:49] run now we on rotting now amen
[1:51:52] absolutely not die only Oh Brother come
[1:51:55] I'll die but do I have to rot yes sir
[1:51:57] you got to R not die only but run after
[1:52:02] his
[1:52:03] dead you ain't getting away today
[1:52:07] waiting 3 years of preachers
[1:52:08] here listen looking at all the flesh
[1:52:10] around here praise God I just wouldn't
[1:52:13] say nothing he said let it alone Let It
[1:52:15] Go praise God it'll be a day when they
[1:52:17] will you will tell them I'm telling you
[1:52:19] today praise God Amen
[1:52:23] oh not die only but right after his
[1:52:26] death we know that to be true that's the
[1:52:29] same thing in New Birth we never go back
[1:52:32] but we go forward when you're born and
[1:52:35] that's why I think today we have so many
[1:52:37] not so many rather uh genuine New Birth
[1:52:40] is because the seed is maybe to
[1:52:43] sympathized with the word or the person
[1:52:46] but they don't want to run away from the
[1:52:49] old system that they were in they don't
[1:52:53] want to come out of it even today uh
[1:52:56] they might have come out some strange
[1:52:58] denomination that dressed a certain way
[1:52:59] and had certain ways and look a certain
[1:53:01] way they want to come in the message and
[1:53:03] keep the same ways and then judge you
[1:53:05] because you're not like
[1:53:08] them that's right I know what I'm
[1:53:11] talking about so don't judge me praise
[1:53:14] God

[1:53:40] Christ I'm a true disciple I don't care
[1:53:43] about all your gossip it don't mean

[1:53:49] God here's what you got to hear right
[1:53:51] here maybe s asde with the word of the
[1:53:53] person but they don't want to ride away
[1:53:55] from the old system that they were in
[1:53:58] they don't want to come out of it they
[1:53:59] want to stay in the old system to watch
[1:54:02] and claim the new birth or the message
[1:54:05] of the
[1:54:07] age now we got them brother we got them
[1:54:10] now huh want to stay with all nasty ways

[1:54:30] I'm born again you you are not born
[1:54:31] again until fire burns the old system
[1:54:34] out of
[1:54:35] [Applause]
[1:54:37] you and then you're born again when fire
[1:54:40] cleans every demon out of you of
[1:54:42] criticizing talking and gossiping when

[1:54:49] Ghost amen
[1:54:53] glory and they want to be evil in the
[1:54:56] message and Prejudice and everything
[1:54:58] else and claim the new birth and claim
[1:54:59] the message of the age we found that
[1:55:01] under Wesley we found that under the
[1:55:04] Luther Wesley Pentecostal and all of
[1:55:07] Ages they still try to hold on to the
[1:55:09] old system and claim this but the old
[1:55:12] system age must die right in order to
[1:55:16] bring forth the new one they still want
[1:55:18] to cling notice they know the old system
[1:55:21] is dead they know it's wrong they read
[1:55:24] the prophets quotes they shouldn't talk
[1:55:26] and do all these they know it old sister
[1:55:28] they know it's dead see to me now but
[1:55:32] they just don't want to run out of
[1:55:35] it amen they're afraid if they go tell

[1:55:42] look I want to be like Jesus what are
[1:55:43] you talking about you in the message see
[1:55:46] that they're afraid to say that I know
[1:55:48] they
[1:55:48] are in this message oh yes they are they
[1:55:52] want to still joke and Carry On and and
[1:55:55] and you know you know what I'm talking
[1:55:56] about they won't right out of it see now
[1:55:59] rot is when it's really done away with
[1:56:04] when a claim is made that they are
[1:56:06] newborn but a claim watch is only a
[1:56:09] begotten
[1:56:12] sign so therefore the Pentecostals is
[1:56:14] now
[1:56:15] begotten the New Birth has now begotten
[1:56:19] and it's only a sign a claiming time you
[1:56:22] claim to have the new birth but add to
[1:56:25] your new birth virtue knowledge
[1:56:28] Temperance patience and while you're
[1:56:30] adding you're rotting rotting rotting
[1:56:34] rotting you're rotting out to yourself
[1:56:36] and you're
[1:56:38] adding there you
[1:56:40] [Applause]
[1:56:43] are but a claim is only a begotten sign
[1:56:46] rotting brings forth the new birth amen
[1:56:50] you got to rot away from it just as as
[1:56:52] we did in all ages through the west and
[1:56:55] all forth but the thing of it is after
[1:56:57] the New Birth is
[1:56:59] born Wesley Luther came forth with one
[1:57:01] word they just want to live stand by the
[1:57:04] Jud shall live by faith well he could no
[1:57:06] longer cling to the old system he had to
[1:57:08] come out of it you see what I'm saying
[1:57:11] now you couldn't be Lutheran and still
[1:57:13] cling to the Catholic could be Wesley
[1:57:15] still cling to Lutheran Pentecost is
[1:57:18] still cling to that in on see and
[1:57:20] neither can you be Joseph affection and
[1:57:22] cling to the old ways old system old
[1:57:25] nasty
[1:57:27] things well
[1:57:29] church I'm only a disciple pointing to
[1:57:31] the
[1:57:32] word don't die on me praise God
[1:57:36] Amen Hallelujah so the old seed must
[1:57:40] absolutely d right out who's the old
[1:57:42] seed that's
[1:57:43] you your imagination memory affection
[1:57:46] constant reasoning and what you think
[1:57:47] and what you feel that's you why you
[1:57:53] who is it it's you praise God you cannot
[1:57:56] stay with that old system and claim the
[1:57:58] new birth or the message of the age they
[1:58:01] still try to hold on to this the old
[1:58:03] system and claim this but the old system
[1:58:04] must die and rot in order to bring forth
[1:58:06] the new one now R is when it really done
[1:58:09] away with or claims only begotten son
[1:58:11] okay I've been through this here amen
[1:58:14] praise God so therefore seven birth
[1:58:16] pains by Malachi 4 brings on
[1:58:19] rotting amen and then love sealing all
[1:58:23] the Seven Virtues after riding away to
[1:58:25] old self you have got to ride away from
[1:58:27] all the old things you did in the
[1:58:29] message and all these years and die out
[1:58:33] and come into Joseph Perfection and rot
[1:58:35] and
[1:58:36] die or die and rot see a seven birth
[1:58:39] pains for a newborn word bride living by
[1:58:43] the word every word hallelujah birth

[1:59:00] about 40 minutes amen I want to just
[1:59:02] drive this thing home but since I won't

[1:59:06] whole
[1:59:07] thing amen praise God
[1:59:12] Amen praise God now let's be honest page
[1:59:16] 26 birth pains if we see that the church
[1:59:18] is in a condition I'm just speaking
[1:59:20] about today haven't we at that time
[1:59:22] again now just look at the things of the
[1:59:25] problems of the Bible that would would
[1:59:27] be going on in the church at this time
[1:59:29] we see what's going on in the world and
[1:59:31] we see it at the end now let's look at
[1:59:32] the church see she the church had birth
[1:59:36] pains on the Luther now we know there
[1:59:38] seven Church ages and seven Messengers
[1:59:40] to them Church ages according to
[1:59:42] Revelations but now when Luther had to
[1:59:44] come forth it certainly throw the church
[1:59:47] into birth pains but it brought forth
[1:59:49] the
[1:59:51] Luther yes sir after that got in trouble
[1:59:55] again so it brought forth a Wesley
[1:59:56] that's right got uh uh got forth again
[1:59:59] and brought forth the Pentecost each one
[2:00:01] of them messengers of the age Rock the
[2:00:04] back to the word the message of the age
[2:00:06] the message of it according to the Bible
[2:00:09] amen now notice each age Rock the church
[2:00:12] and give it birth
[2:00:14] pains and we have got to come to birth
[2:00:16] pains
[2:00:17] friends page 27 Now quickly now she's in
[2:00:20] the in the phase in that phase beyond
[2:00:23] the shadow of a doubt we're in the lean
[2:00:25] Church age now her Messengers promised
[2:00:27] in Malachi 4 uh 4th chapter he's promis
[2:00:30] to do it and the message to bring back
[2:00:31] the word bring the people back to the
[2:00:33] word birth is to be she's to be
[2:00:36] delivered of a new birth from According
[2:00:39] to Malachi 4 there's two systems working
[2:00:41] in the church the world today amen I'm
[2:00:43] going to get off my shoulder and then I
[2:00:44] can uh have it over with we all know
[2:00:46] that that's the word of God in
[2:00:48] denominational system there's the two
[2:00:50] system that work just there was Jacob
[2:00:52] and Esau amen one after the spirit and
[2:00:55] one after the Flesh and what is it Esau
[2:00:57] had Esau and Jacob was fighting in the
[2:00:59] wombs of the mother even to the time
[2:01:01] they were born in this message they're
[2:01:03] fighting in the womb until Joseph
[2:01:06] Perfection comes forth with the love of
[2:01:07] God in Perfection they're still fighting
[2:01:10] in the womb in the
[2:01:12] message twins praise God Amen and so is
[2:01:18] denominational in the word fighting
[2:01:20] against one another they've been they
[2:01:22] have been since Luther first brought the
[2:01:24] First Reformation I hope that's simple
[2:01:26] enough that you can understand it now
[2:01:28] these men if they can pick up this and
[2:01:32] go out with it these disciples or they
[2:01:35] can make more sense to it see to bring
[2:01:39] it to a
[2:01:41] place have we come there October 7th did
[2:01:46] some disciples bring it to a
[2:01:48] place huh these men
[2:01:52] praise God here's a prophet speaking I
[2:01:55] just want to lay this
[2:01:57] seed sew it praise God but I hope they
[2:02:01] make it come to
[2:02:05] life
[2:02:07] die you love the prophet then die and
[2:02:10] live his
[2:02:12] message praise
